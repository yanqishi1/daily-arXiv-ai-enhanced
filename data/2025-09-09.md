Result: 实验表明最优离散化策略随模型容量而变化，发现了语言和副语言模式，聚类数据选择对模型鲁棒性有重要影响，领域匹配在离散化训练和目标应用之间至关重要。

Conclusion: 离散单元表示在语音语言模型中具有重要作用，模型容量、聚类策略和领域匹配是影响语音建模效果的关键因素，需要根据具体应用场景选择适当的离散化方法。

Abstract: This paper investigates discrete unit representations in Speech Language
Models (SLMs), focusing on optimizing speech modeling during continual
pre-training. In this paper, we systematically examine how model architecture,
data representation, and training robustness influence the pre-training stage
in which we adapt existing pre-trained language models to the speech modality.
Our experiments highlight the role of speech encoders and clustering
granularity across different model scales, showing how optimal discretization
strategies vary with model capacity. By examining cluster distribution and
phonemic alignments, we investigate the effective use of discrete vocabulary,
uncovering both linguistic and paralinguistic patterns. Additionally, we
explore the impact of clustering data selection on model robustness,
highlighting the importance of domain matching between discretization training
and target applications.

### [2] [Beyond ROUGE: N-Gram Subspace Features for LLM Hallucination Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05360)
*Jerry Li,Evangelos Papalexakis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过构建N-Gram频率张量和张量分解方法，提出了一种新的语言模型幻觉检测方法，在HaluEval数据集上表现超过传统基线方法并与最先进的LLM判断方法竞争。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型存在幻觉问题，影响信息的可靠性。当前的检测方法如ROUGE、BERTScore等基础指标缺乏足够的语义深度，无法有效检测幻觉内容。

Method: 受ROUGE启发，构建N-Gram频率张量来提取更丰富的语义结构和共现模式。通过张量分解提取奇异值，作为特征输入到多层感知机(MLP)二分类器进行幻觉检测。

Result: 在HaluEval数据集上评估，方法显著超过传统基线方法，并与最先进的LLM判断方法体现竞争性能。

Conclusion: 通过N-Gram张量表征和张量分解，可以提取更有效的语义特征来检测语言模型的幻觉内容，为提高LLM信息可靠性提供了新的方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness across a wide
variety of tasks involving natural language, however, a fundamental problem of
hallucinations still plagues these models, limiting their trustworthiness in
generating consistent, truthful information. Detecting hallucinations has
quickly become an important topic, with various methods such as uncertainty
estimation, LLM Judges, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and consistency
checks showing promise. Many of these methods build upon foundational metrics,
such as ROUGE, BERTScore, or Perplexity, which often lack the semantic depth
necessary to detect hallucinations effectively. In this work, we propose a
novel approach inspired by ROUGE that constructs an N-Gram frequency tensor
from LLM-generated text. This tensor captures richer semantic structure by
encoding co-occurrence patterns, enabling better differentiation between
factual and hallucinated content. We demonstrate this by applying tensor
decomposition methods to extract singular values from each mode and use these
as input features to train a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) binary classifier for
hallucinations. Our method is evaluated on the HaluEval dataset and
demonstrates significant improvements over traditional baselines, as well as
competitive performance against state-of-the-art LLM judges.

### [3] [A Lightweight Framework for Trigger-Guided LoRA-Based Self-Adaptation in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05385)
*Jiacheng Wei,Faguo Wu,Xiao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SAGE是一个触发引导的动态微调框架，能够在推理时实现自适应更新，通过分解复杂推理任务为原子子任务，实时检测推理失败并动态优化参数更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在推理时无法持续适应和学习新数据，限制了其在实际应用中的表现。

Method: SAGE包含三个核心组件：触发模块（实时检测推理失败）、触发缓冲模块（使用HDBSCAN进行流式聚类和异常样本处理）、Lora存储模块（动态优化参数更新的适配器池）。

Result: 评估结果显示SAGE在原子推理子任务上表现出优秀的准确性、鲁棒性和稳定性，通过测试时的动态知识更新实现了显著改进。

Conclusion: SAGE框架有效解决了LLM在推理时无法持续学习的问题，为实时自适应推理提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models are unable to continuously adapt and learn from new
data during reasoning at inference time. To address this limitation, we propose
that complex reasoning tasks be decomposed into atomic subtasks and introduce
SAGE, a trigger-guided dynamic fine-tuning framework that enables adaptive
updates during reasoning at inference time. SAGE consists of three key
components: (1) a Trigger module that detects reasoning failures through
multiple evaluation metrics in real time; (2) a Trigger Buffer module that
clusters anomaly samples using a streaming clustering process with HDBSCAN,
followed by stability checks and similarity-based merging; and (3) a Lora Store
module that dynamically optimizes parameter updates with an adapter pool for
knowledge retention. Evaluation results show that SAGE demonstrates excellent
accuracy, robustness, and stability on the atomic reasoning subtask through
dynamic knowledge updating during test time.

### [4] [Talk Isn't Always Cheap: Understanding Failure Modes in Multi-Agent Debate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05396)
*Andrea Wynn,Harsh Satija,Gillian Hadfield*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 多治理机器辨论在模型能力异质的情况下可能导致性能下降，因为模型更偏向达成一致而非挑战错误推理


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索模型能力异质性对多治理机器辨论动态和结果的影响，识别辨论模式的潜在失败模式

Method: 通过一系列实验分析模型在辨论过程中的行为模式，观察模型如何围绕同伴推理进行反应

Result: 辨论可能导致准确率随时间下降，即使强模型占多数也会发生正确到错误答案的转变，模型更偏向达成一致而非挑战错误推理

Conclusion: 天真地应用辨论策略可能造成性能退化，需要为模型提供适当激励和技能以抵御说服力强但错误的推理

Abstract: While multi-agent debate has been proposed as a promising strategy for
improving AI reasoning ability, we find that debate can sometimes be harmful
rather than helpful. The prior work has exclusively focused on debates within
homogeneous groups of agents, whereas we explore how diversity in model
capabilities influences the dynamics and outcomes of multi-agent interactions.
Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that debate can lead to a
decrease in accuracy over time -- even in settings where stronger (i.e., more
capable) models outnumber their weaker counterparts. Our analysis reveals that
models frequently shift from correct to incorrect answers in response to peer
reasoning, favoring agreement over challenging flawed reasoning. These results
highlight important failure modes in the exchange of reasons during multi-agent
debate, suggesting that naive applications of debate may cause performance
degradation when agents are neither incentivized nor adequately equipped to
resist persuasive but incorrect reasoning.

### [5] [No Translation Needed: Forecasting Quality from Fertility and Metadata](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05425)
*Jessica M. Lundin,Ada Zhang,David Adelani,Cody Carroll*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用语言类型学特征、词歇率和基本元数据，不需运行翻译系统即可准确预测GPT-4o在FLORES-200语言对中的翻译质量（ChrF指标）


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何在不运行实际翻译系统的情况下，仅通过语言特征和简单统计来预测翻译质量

Method: 采用梯度提升模型，输入特征包括词歇比率、词汇数量、语言家族、字符系统和地理区域等语言元数据

Result: 在203种语言上获得良好预测性能：XX→英语R²=0.66，英语→XX R²=0.72，语言类型学因素对英语翻译预测更重要，词歇率对多样化目标语翻译更关键

Conclusion: 翻译质量受到词级别歇率和广泛语言类型学的共同影响，为多语言评估和质量估测提供了新视角

Abstract: We show that translation quality can be predicted with surprising accuracy
\textit{without ever running the translation system itself}. Using only a
handful of features, token fertility ratios, token counts, and basic linguistic
metadata (language family, script, and region), we can forecast ChrF scores for
GPT-4o translations across 203 languages in the FLORES-200 benchmark. Gradient
boosting models achieve favorable performance ($R^{2}=0.66$ for
XX$\rightarrow$English and $R^{2}=0.72$ for English$\rightarrow$XX). Feature
importance analyses reveal that typological factors dominate predictions into
English, while fertility plays a larger role for translations into diverse
target languages. These findings suggest that translation quality is shaped by
both token-level fertility and broader linguistic typology, offering new
insights for multilingual evaluation and quality estimation.

### [6] [Direct-Scoring NLG Evaluators Can Use Pairwise Comparisons Too](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05440)
*Logan Lawrence,Ashton Williamson,Alexander Shelton*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种使用合成摘要进行直接评分的方法，用于解决大语言模型作为自动评分器时的绝对评分问题，性能与现有最佳成对比较方法相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在评估自由形式内容时，成对比较方法虽然表现良好，但缺乏给单个摘要赋予绝对分数的能力，而这对需要设置阈值的应用场景至关重要。

Method: 提出一种直接评分方法，利用合成摘要在测试时模拟成对机器排名，从而能够给单个摘要赋予绝对分数。

Result: 在SummEval、TopicalChat和HANNA三个元评估基准上，该方法在轴平均样本级相关性指标上与现有最佳成对评估方法表现相当（分别为+0.03、-0.03和+0.05）。

Conclusion: 该方法为大语言模型作为自动评分器提供了一种能够赋予绝对分数的有效方案，且性能与成对比较方法相当，为需要阈值处理的应用场景提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: As large-language models have been increasingly used as automatic raters for
evaluating free-form content, including document summarization, dialog, and
story generation, work has been dedicated to evaluating such models by
measuring their correlations with human judgment. For \textit{sample-level}
performance, methods which operate by using pairwise comparisons between
machine-generated text perform well but often lack the ability to assign
absolute scores to individual summaries, an ability crucial for use cases that
require thresholding. In this work, we propose a direct-scoring method which
uses synthetic summaries to act as pairwise machine rankings at test time. We
show that our method performs comparably to state-of-the-art pairwise
evaluators in terms of axis-averaged sample-level correlations on the SummEval
(\textbf{+0.03}), TopicalChat (\textbf{-0.03}), and HANNA (\textbf{+0.05})
meta-evaluation benchmarks, and release the synthetic in-context summaries as
data to facilitate future work.

### [7] [From Staff Messages to Actionable Insights: A Multi-Stage LLM Classification Framework for Healthcare Analytics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05484)
*Hajar Sakai,Yi-En Tseng,Mohammadsadegh Mikaeili,Joshua Bosire,Franziska Jovin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用多步骤LLM框架分析医院电话中心员工消息，识别主题和分类原因，最佳模型o3达到78.4%综合指标


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医院电话中心涉及大量员工消息处理，但传统监督学习需要注解数据和调优，LLM提供更高效的医疗分析方案

Method: 提出多步骤LLM框架，评估包括推理、通用和轻量型多种LLM，并整合数据安全措施和HIPAA遵循要求

Result: 最佳模型o3达到78.4%加权F1分数和79.2%准确率，gpt-5为75.3%加权F1分数和76.2%准确率，输出集成到可视化决策支持工具

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效利用员工消息数据，识别培训机会，支持改善患者体验和护理质量，为医疗环境提供可行的分析解决方案

Abstract: Hospital call centers serve as the primary contact point for patients within
a hospital system. They also generate substantial volumes of staff messages as
navigators process patient requests and communicate with the hospital offices
following the established protocol restrictions and guidelines. This
continuously accumulated large amount of text data can be mined and processed
to retrieve insights; however, traditional supervised learning approaches
require annotated data, extensive training, and model tuning. Large Language
Models (LLMs) offer a paradigm shift toward more computationally efficient
methodologies for healthcare analytics. This paper presents a multi-stage
LLM-based framework that identifies staff message topics and classifies
messages by their reasons in a multi-class fashion. In the process, multiple
LLM types, including reasoning, general-purpose, and lightweight models, were
evaluated. The best-performing model was o3, achieving 78.4% weighted F1-score
and 79.2% accuracy, followed closely by gpt-5 (75.3% Weighted F1-score and
76.2% accuracy). The proposed methodology incorporates data security measures
and HIPAA compliance requirements essential for healthcare environments. The
processed LLM outputs are integrated into a visualization decision support tool
that transforms the staff messages into actionable insights accessible to
healthcare professionals. This approach enables more efficient utilization of
the collected staff messaging data, identifies navigator training
opportunities, and supports improved patient experience and care quality.

### [8] [The Token Tax: Systematic Bias in Multilingual Tokenization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05486)
*Jessica M. Lundin,Ada Zhang,Nihal Karim,Hamza Louzan,Victor Wei,David Adelani,Cody Carroll*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了词元化效率对涉及形态复杂、资源稀缺语言的负面影响，通过在AfriMMLU数据集上评10个大语言模型发现生育率(每词所需词元数)可靠预测准确率，高生育率导致低准确率。还发现理性模型在高低资源语言上都表现更优，缩小了以往的准确率差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 词元化效率低下给形态复杂、资源稀缺的语言带来结构性不利，既增加计算资源消耗又降低准确性。研究者想要证明词元生育率与模型性能的关联性，并提出更公平的NLP解决方案。

Method: 在AfriMMLU数据集(9000道多选题，5个学科，16种非洲语言)上评10个大语言模型，分析生育率(每词所需词元数)与准确率的关系，对比理性模型与非理性模型的表现差异。

Result: 生育率可靠预测准确率，高生育率导致低准确率。理性模型(DeepSeek, o1)在高低资源语言上都超过非理性模型，缩小了历史代模型的性能差距。词元数倍增导致训练成本和时间四倍增长。

Conclusion: 结果诱导开发考虑形态特征的词元化方法，建立公平的定价机制和多语言测试集，以实现更公平的自然语言处理。

Abstract: Tokenization inefficiency imposes structural disadvantages on morphologically
complex, low-resource languages, inflating compute resources and depressing
accuracy. We evaluate 10 large language models (LLMs) on AfriMMLU (9,000 MCQA
items; 5 subjects; 16 African languages) and show that fertility (tokens/word)
reliably predicts accuracy. Higher fertility consistently predicts lower
accuracy across all models and subjects. We further find that reasoning models
(DeepSeek, o1) consistently outperform non-reasoning peers across high and low
resource languages in the AfriMMLU dataset, narrowing accuracy gaps observed in
prior generations. Finally, translating token inflation to economics, a
doubling in tokens results in quadrupled training cost and time, underscoring
the token tax faced by many languages. These results motivate morphologically
aware tokenization, fair pricing, and multilingual benchmarks for equitable
natural language processing (NLP).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 基于RAG架构的生物医学文献问答系统，整合多源信息检索和Mistral-7B生成模型，在乳腺癌文献问答任务上取得显著效果提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统健康搜索引擎的不足和公众获取生物医学研究的滞后问题，提供准确、基于证据的医学信息

Method: 使用MiniLM语义嵌入和FAISS向量搜索的检索管道，配合QLoRA优化的Mistral-7B-v0.3语言模型进行答案生成

Result: 在BERTScore(F1)指标上相比基线模型在事实一致性和语义相关性方面有显著提升

Conclusion: RAG增强的语言模型有潜力弥合复杂生物医学文献与可访问公共卫生知识之间的差距

Abstract: This work presents a Biomedical Literature Question Answering (Q&A) system
based on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, designed to
improve access to accurate, evidence-based medical information. Addressing the
shortcomings of conventional health search engines and the lag in public access
to biomedical research, the system integrates diverse sources, including PubMed
articles, curated Q&A datasets, and medical encyclopedias ,to retrieve relevant
information and generate concise, context-aware responses. The retrieval
pipeline uses MiniLM-based semantic embeddings and FAISS vector search, while
answer generation is performed by a fine-tuned Mistral-7B-v0.3 language model
optimized using QLoRA for efficient, low-resource training. The system supports
both general medical queries and domain-specific tasks, with a focused
evaluation on breast cancer literature demonstrating the value of
domain-aligned retrieval. Empirical results, measured using BERTScore (F1),
show substantial improvements in factual consistency and semantic relevance
compared to baseline models. The findings underscore the potential of
RAG-enhanced language models to bridge the gap between complex biomedical
literature and accessible public health knowledge, paving the way for future
work on multilingual adaptation, privacy-preserving inference, and personalized
medical AI systems.

### [10] [Using Contrastive Learning to Improve Two-Way Reasoning in Large Language Models: The Obfuscation Task as a Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05553)
*Serge Lionel Nikiema,Jordan Samhi,Micheline Bénédicte Moumoula,Albérick Euraste Djiré,Abdoul Kader Kaboré,Jacques Klein,Tegawendé F. Bissyandé*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出双向推理作为测试AI真正理解的标准，发现现有模型存在认知专业化问题，并开发了对比微调(CFT)方法成功实现双向推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI领域一个基本问题：大型语言模型是真正理解概念还是仅仅识别模式。研究者认为真正的理解应该自然允许可逆性，即能够双向应用变换。

Method: 提出双向推理测试框架，开发对比微调(CFT)方法，使用三种示例类型进行训练：保持语义的正例、不同语义的负例、正向混淆示例。

Result: 实验证明CFT成功实现了双向推理，在保持正向任务能力的同时获得了强大的反向性能，解决了认知专业化问题。

Conclusion: 双向推理既是评估真正理解的理论框架，也是开发更强大AI系统的实用训练方法，为AI理解能力的发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: This research addresses a fundamental question in AI: whether large language
models truly understand concepts or simply recognize patterns. The authors
propose bidirectional reasoning,the ability to apply transformations in both
directions without being explicitly trained on the reverse direction, as a test
for genuine understanding. They argue that true comprehension should naturally
allow reversibility. For example, a model that can change a variable name like
userIndex to i should also be able to infer that i represents a user index
without reverse training. The researchers tested current language models and
discovered what they term cognitive specialization: when models are fine-tuned
on forward tasks, their performance on those tasks improves, but their ability
to reason bidirectionally becomes significantly worse. To address this issue,
they developed Contrastive Fine-Tuning (CFT), which trains models using three
types of examples: positive examples that maintain semantic meaning, negative
examples with different semantics, and forward-direction obfuscation examples.
This approach aims to develop deeper understanding rather than surface-level
pattern recognition and allows reverse capabilities to develop naturally
without explicit reverse training. Their experiments demonstrated that CFT
successfully achieved bidirectional reasoning, enabling strong reverse
performance while maintaining forward task capabilities. The authors conclude
that bidirectional reasoning serves both as a theoretical framework for
assessing genuine understanding and as a practical training approach for
developing more capable AI systems.

### [11] [Ad hoc conventions generalize to new referents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05566)
*Anya Ji,Claire Augusta Bergey,Ron Eliav,Yoav Artzi,Robert D. Hawkins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现人们在建立新的共享命名系统时，会进行概念协调而非简单的任意标签分配，这种协调能泛化到未讨论的新对象上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨人们如何为从未讨论过的事物建立共享命名系统，检验是形成任意标签还是进行概念协调的两种竞争理论。

Method: 使用KiloGram数据集中的1000多个抽象七巧板图像，通过302名参与者的双人交流研究，测量他们对未讨论图像的描述一致性。

Result: 发现强烈的泛化证据：伙伴间的描述一致性显著提高；泛化随视觉相似度非线性衰减；在不同可命名性水平上都表现稳健。

Conclusion: 临时约定不是任意标签，而是真正的概念协调，这对指称理论和设计更自适应的语言代理具有重要意义。

Abstract: How do people talk about things they've never talked about before? One view
suggests that a new shared naming system establishes an arbitrary link to a
specific target, like proper names that cannot extend beyond their bearers. An
alternative view proposes that forming a shared way of describing objects
involves broader conceptual alignment, reshaping each individual's semantic
space in ways that should generalize to new referents. We test these competing
accounts in a dyadic communication study (N=302) leveraging the
recently-released KiloGram dataset containing over 1,000 abstract tangram
images. After pairs of participants coordinated on referential conventions for
one set of images through repeated communication, we measured the extent to
which their descriptions aligned for undiscussed images. We found strong
evidence for generalization: partners showed increased alignment relative to
their pre-test labels. Generalization also decayed nonlinearly with visual
similarity (consistent with Shepard's law) and was robust across levels of the
images' nameability. These findings suggest that ad hoc conventions are not
arbitrary labels but reflect genuine conceptual coordination, with implications
for theories of reference and the design of more adaptive language agents.

TL;DR: CoPeD方法通过引入正确性感知任务设置和加权损失函数，提升小语言模型从大语言模型生成的思维链数据中学习推理质量的能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型通过微调大语言模型生成的思维链数据来复制推理能力，但这些数据可能包含噪声推理，导致小模型学习到虚假相关性，影响推理质量

Method: 提出Chain-of-Thought Correctness Perception Distillation (CoPeD)：1) 正确性感知任务设置，鼓励模型基于正确推理预测答案并修正错误推理；2) 正确性感知加权损失，根据推理和答案的联合损失动态调整训练样本权重

Result: 实验表明CoPeD在分布内和分布外基准推理数据集上均有效

Conclusion: CoPeD通过改进任务设置和数据利用方式，有效提升了学生模型的推理质量，特别是在处理噪声推理数据时表现出色

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning tasks but are expensive to
deploy. Thus small language models (SLMs) are fine-tuned on CoT data generated
by LLMs to copy LLMs' abilities. However, these CoT data may include noisy
rationales that either fail to substantiate the answers or contribute no
additional information to support answer prediction, which leads SLMs to
capture spurious correlations between questions and answers and compromise the
quality of reasoning. In this work, we propose Chain-of-Thought Correctness
Perception Distillation (CoPeD), which aims to improve the reasoning quality of
the student model from the perspectives of task setting and data utilization.
Firstly, we introduce a correctness-aware task setting that encourages the
student model to predict answers based on correct rationales and revise them
when they are incorrect. This setting improves the faithfulness of reasoning
and allows the model to learn from its mistakes. Then, we propose a
Correctness-Aware Weighted loss, which dynamically adjusts the contribution of
each training instance based on the combined loss of the rationale and the
answer. This strategy encourages the model to focus more on samples where the
rationale offers stronger support for the correct answer. Experiments have
shown that CoPeD is effective on both in-distribution (IND) and
out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmark reasoning datasets.

TL;DR: Icon²：一种利用LLM表示空间内在调控的高效偏好数据集构建方法，通过层间方向向量编码人类偏好并筛选自合成指令，在解码时进行双向内在控制来生成具有明确对齐差异的响应对，显著提升对齐效果和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统偏好数据集构建方法存在两个主要问题：依赖预收集指令导致与目标模型分布不匹配，以及需要采样多个随机响应带来巨大计算开销。需要探索更高效且定制化的偏好数据构建范式。

Method: 1) 提取层间方向向量编码复杂人类偏好；2) 基于内在一致性筛选自合成指令；3) 在解码时应用双向内在控制来引导token表示，精确生成具有清晰对齐差异的响应对。

Result: Llama3-8B和Qwen2-7B在AlpacaEval 2.0上平均胜率提升13.89%，在Arena-Hard上提升13.45%，同时计算成本降低高达48.1%。

Conclusion: Icon²通过利用LLM表示空间的内在调控机制，实现了高效且定制化的偏好数据集构建，在保持高质量对齐效果的同时显著降低了计算成本，为LLM对齐提供了新的有效途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require high quality preference datasets to
align with human preferences. However, conventional methods for constructing
such datasets face significant challenges: reliance on pre-collected
instructions often leads to distribution mismatches with target models, while
the need for sampling multiple stochastic responses introduces substantial
computational overhead. In this work, we explore a paradigm shift by leveraging
inherent regulation of LLMs' representation space for efficient and tailored
preference dataset construction, named Icon$^{2}$. Specifically, it first
extracts layer-wise direction vectors to encode sophisticated human preferences
and then uses these vectors to filter self-synthesized instructions based on
their inherent consistency. During decoding, bidirectional inherent control is
applied to steer token representations, enabling the precise generation of
response pairs with clear alignment distinctions. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements in both alignment and efficiency.
Llama3-8B and Qwen2-7B achieve an average win rate improvement of 13.89% on
AlpacaEval 2.0 and 13.45% on Arena-Hard, while reducing computational costs by
up to 48.1%.

Abstract: The paradigm shift from traditional ranked-based search to Generative Search
Engines has rendered conventional SEO metrics obsolete, creating an urgent need
to understand, measure, and optimize for content influence on synthesized
answers. This paper introduces a comprehensive, end-to-end framework for
Generative Search Engine Optimization (GSEO) to address this challenge. We make
two primary contributions. First, we construct CC-GSEO-Bench, a large-scale,
content-centric benchmark, and propose a multi-dimensional evaluation framework
that systematically quantifies influence, moving beyond surface-level
attribution to assess substantive semantic impact. Second, we design a novel
multi-agent system that operationalizes this framework, automating the
strategic refinement of content through a collaborative analyze-revise-evaluate
workflow. Our empirical analysis using this framework reveals novel insights
into the dynamics of content influence, offering actionable strategies for
creators and establishing a principled foundation for future GSEO research.

Abstract: Aligning acoustic and linguistic representations is a central challenge to
bridge the pre-trained models in knowledge transfer for automatic speech
recognition (ASR). This alignment is inherently structured and asymmetric:
while multiple consecutive acoustic frames typically correspond to a single
linguistic token (many-to-one), certain acoustic transition regions may relate
to multiple adjacent tokens (one-to-many). Moreover, acoustic sequences often
include frames with no linguistic counterpart, such as background noise or
silence may lead to imbalanced matching conditions. In this work, we take a new
insight to regard alignment and matching as a detection problem, where the goal
is to identify meaningful correspondences with high precision and recall
ensuring full coverage of linguistic tokens while flexibly handling redundant
or noisy acoustic frames in transferring linguistic knowledge for ASR. Based on
this new insight, we propose an unbalanced optimal transport-based alignment
model that explicitly handles distributional mismatch and structural
asymmetries with soft and partial matching between acoustic and linguistic
modalities. Our method ensures that every linguistic token is grounded in at
least one acoustic observation, while allowing for flexible, probabilistic
mappings from acoustic to linguistic units. We evaluate our proposed model with
experiments on an CTC-based ASR system with a pre-trained language model for
knowledge transfer. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in flexibly controlling degree of matching and hence to improve ASR
performance.

Result: 实验结果显示零样本模型和微调模型在捕捉歌词细腻情感内容方面各有优势和局限性。

Conclusion: LLMs在创意文本情感识别方面具有潜力，为基于情感的音乐信息检索应用提供了模型选择策略的见解。

Abstract: The emotional content of song lyrics plays a pivotal role in shaping listener
experiences and influencing musical preferences. This paper investigates the
task of multi-label emotional attribution of song lyrics by predicting six
emotional intensity scores corresponding to six fundamental emotions. A
manually labeled dataset is constructed using a mean opinion score (MOS)
approach, which aggregates annotations from multiple human raters to ensure
reliable ground-truth labels. Leveraging this dataset, we conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of several publicly available large language models
(LLMs) under zero-shot scenarios. Additionally, we fine-tune a BERT-based model
specifically for predicting multi-label emotion scores. Experimental results
reveal the relative strengths and limitations of zero-shot and fine-tuned
models in capturing the nuanced emotional content of lyrics. Our findings
highlight the potential of LLMs for emotion recognition in creative texts,
providing insights into model selection strategies for emotion-based music
information retrieval applications. The labeled dataset is available at

TL;DR: SAID是一个新颖的框架，首次统一整合文本和关系结构信息进行模型预训练，通过QueryAdapt机制在关系标记级别生成意图特定的关系标记，显著提升了少样本意图检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注文本数据，忽略了对话系统中关键的结构信息（如查询-查询关系和查询-回答关系），导致在少样本意图检测场景下性能受限。

Method: 提出SAID框架，统一整合文本和关系结构信息进行预训练；设计QueryAdapt机制，在关系标记级别生成意图特定的关系标记，实现更细粒度的知识迁移。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上的大量实验结果表明，SAID显著优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: SAID通过有效整合文本和结构信息，为少样本意图检测提供了更强大的解决方案，证明了结构信息在对话系统中的重要性。

Abstract: Intent detection is a crucial component of modern conversational systems,
since accurately identifying user intent at the beginning of a conversation is
essential for generating effective responses. Recent efforts have focused on
studying this problem under a challenging few-shot scenario. These approaches
primarily leverage large-scale unlabeled dialogue text corpora to pretrain
language models through various pretext tasks, followed by fine-tuning for
intent detection with very limited annotations. Despite the improvements
achieved, existing methods have predominantly focused on textual data,
neglecting to effectively capture the crucial structural information inherent
in conversational systems, such as the query-query relation and query-answer
relation. To address this gap, we propose SAID, a novel framework that
integrates both textual and relational structure information in a unified
manner for model pretraining for the first time. Building on this framework, we
further propose a novel mechanism, the query-adaptive attention network
(QueryAdapt), which operates at the relation token level by generating
intent-specific relation tokens from well-learned query-query and query-answer
relations explicitly, enabling more fine-grained knowledge transfer. Extensive
experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that SAID
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的神经架构搜索方法严重依赖提示工程和领域特定调优，限制了其在实际应用中的实用性和可扩展性。

Method: 提出NCode通用数值字符串表示法编码神经架构，将NAS问题重新定义为排名任务，使用基于剪枝的子空间采样策略生成指令调优样本训练LLM。

Result: 在领域内（如图像分类CNN）和跨领域（如分割和生成的LoRA配置）任务中均取得竞争性性能。

Abstract: Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new avenues for
solving complex optimization problems, including Neural Architecture Search
(NAS). However, existing LLM-driven NAS approaches rely heavily on prompt
engineering and domain-specific tuning, limiting their practicality and
scalability across diverse tasks. In this work, we propose LM-Searcher, a novel
framework that leverages LLMs for cross-domain neural architecture optimization
without the need for extensive domain-specific adaptation. Central to our
approach is NCode, a universal numerical string representation for neural
architectures, which enables cross-domain architecture encoding and search. We
also reformulate the NAS problem as a ranking task, training LLMs to select
high-performing architectures from candidate pools using instruction-tuning
samples derived from a novel pruning-based subspace sampling strategy. Our
curated dataset, encompassing a wide range of architecture-performance pairs,
encourages robust and transferable learning. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that LM-Searcher achieves competitive performance in both in-domain
(e.g., CNNs for image classification) and out-of-domain (e.g., LoRA
configurations for segmentation and generation) tasks, establishing a new
paradigm for flexible and generalizable LLM-based architecture search. The
datasets and models will be released at https://github.com/Ashone3/LM-Searcher.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种扩展LLM方法重用范围的新方法，能够处理低相似度或具有隐藏相似性的问题，通过分离问题和解决方案来指导LLM进行解决方案迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法重用通常要求问题高度相似，限制了应用范围。本文旨在扩展方法重用的适用范围，使其能够处理相似度较低或具有隐藏相似性的问题。

Method: 首先将问题和解决方案分离，而不是直接将问题-解决方案对输入LLM。然后引导LLM将解决方案适配到新的相关问题上，使其专注于解决方案迁移而非问题识别。该方法还扩展到仅共享部分特征或隐藏特征的情况。

Result: 实验验证表明，该范围扩展方法提高了筛选出可重用解决方案的概率，从而提升了跨问题方法重用的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过分离问题和解决方案并指导LLM进行解决方案迁移，可以突破传统相似性约束，实现更广泛的跨问题方法重用，显著提高了方法重用的效果和适用范围。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely applied to assist in finding
solutions for diverse questions. Prior work has proposed representing a method
as a pair of a question and its corresponding solution, enabling method reuse.
However, existing approaches typically require the questions to be highly
similar. In this paper, we extend the scope of method reuse to address
questions with low similarity or with hidden similarities that are not
explicitly observable. For questions that are similar in a general-specific
sense (i.e., broader or narrower in scope), we propose to first separate the
question and solution, rather than directly feeding the pair to the LLM. The
LLM is then guided to adapt the solution to new but related questions, allowing
it to focus on solution transfer rather than question recognition. Furthermore,
we extend this approach to cases where questions only share partial features or
hidden characteristics. This enables cross-question method reuse beyond
conventional similarity constraints. Experimental verification shows that our
scope-extension approach increases the probability of filtering out reusable
solutions, thereby improving the effectiveness of cross-question method reuse.

TL;DR: Llama-GENBA-10B是一个100亿参数的三语基础模型，基于Llama 3.1-8B构建，专门针对英语中心偏见问题，支持英语、德语和巴伐利亚语，在巴伐利亚语任务上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型中的英语中心偏见问题，为德语NLP社区提供支持，并促进低资源语言巴伐利亚语的发展。

Method: 基于Llama 3.1-8B进行持续预训练，使用1640亿token的多语料库（英语820亿、德语820亿、巴伐利亚语8000万），创建统一的分词器，优化架构和语言比例超参数，建立首个标准化三语评估套件。

Result: 模型在三语任务上表现优异，微调版本在巴伐利亚语上超越Apertus-8B-2509和gemma-2-9b，成为该语言最佳模型；在英语上优于EuroLLM，在德语上与EuroLLM相当。

Conclusion: 该研究为整合低资源语言的包容性基础模型提供了蓝图，证明了大规模多语言预训练的效率，并记录了能源使用情况。

Abstract: We present Llama-GENBA-10B, a trilingual foundation model addressing
English-centric bias in large language models. Built on Llama 3.1-8B and scaled
to 10B parameters, Llama-GENBA-10B is continuously pretrained on 164B tokens
(82B English, 82B German, and 80M Bavarian), balancing resources while
preventing English dominance. Targeted at the German NLP community, the model
also promotes Bavarian as a low-resource language. Development tackled four
challenges: (1) curating a multilingual corpus despite Bavarian scarcity, (2)
creating a unified tokenizer for English, German, and Bavarian, (3) optimizing
architecture and language-ratio hyperparameters for cross-lingual transfer, and
(4) establishing the first standardized trilingual evaluation suite by
translating German benchmarks into Bavarian. Evaluations show that
Llama-GENBA-10B achieves strong cross-lingual performance, with the fine-tuned
variant surpassing Apertus-8B-2509 and gemma-2-9b in Bavarian and establishing
itself as the best model in its class for this language, while also
outperforming EuroLLM in English and matching its results in German. Training
on the Cerebras CS-2 demonstrated efficient large-scale multilingual
pretraining with documented energy use, offering a blueprint for inclusive
foundation models that integrate low-resource languages.

TL;DR: 文本嵌入模型在数值信息理解方面的能力很弱，尤其在金融领域的应用中存在显著的数值细节编码问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本嵌入模型的能力测试通常不涵盖对细微数值信息的理解，而在金融、医疗等领域中数值的准确理解至关重要

Method: 使用金融领域的合成数据，对13个广泛使用的文本嵌入模型进行评估

Result: 模型普遍在准确编码数值细节方面表现差强，无法有效区分类似"2%"与"20%"这样的数值差异

Conclusion: 现有嵌入模型在数值理解能力上存在显著缺陷，需要进一步研究来提升NLP系统的数值处理能力

Abstract: Text embedding models are widely used in natural language processing
applications. However, their capability is often benchmarked on tasks that do
not require understanding nuanced numerical information in text. As a result,
it remains unclear whether current embedding models can precisely encode
numerical content, such as numbers, into embeddings. This question is critical
because embedding models are increasingly applied in domains where numbers
matter, such as finance and healthcare. For example, Company X's market share
grew by 2\% should be interpreted very differently from Company X's market
share grew by 20\%, even though both indicate growth in market share. This
study aims to examine whether text embedding models can capture such nuances.
Using synthetic data in a financial context, we evaluate 13 widely used text
embedding models and find that they generally struggle to capture numerical
details accurately. Our further analyses provide deeper insights into embedding
numeracy, informing future research to strengthen embedding model-based NLP
systems with improved capacity for handling numerical content.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过分析法语言在主观性NLP任务中的数据环境，揭示了虽然数字文本数量增长，但数据质量、公开性和人口统计因素的缺乏仍然对语言处理能力造成重大挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然法语被认为是中等资源语言，但研究发现在主观性NLP任务中存在显著的数据挑战，需要更详细的评估来理解语言处理的真实状况。

Method: 研究分析了110篇关于法语主观性任务的公开出版物，重点考察了感知分析、情感分析和毒性检测三个任务领域的数据可用性和质量问题。

Result: 发现公开数据集缺乏，现有数据集缺少关键人口统计因素（如年龄、性别），预测模型在不同数据集和模型上表现极不稳定。

Conclusion: 纯粹的数据量增长不能有效提升语言在NLP领域的发展前景，数据质量、多样性和人口因素的考虑对主观性语言模型的准确性至关重要。

Abstract: Given Farsi's speaker base of over 127 million people and the growing
availability of digital text, including more than 1.3 million articles on
Wikipedia, it is considered a middle-resource language. However, this label
quickly crumbles when the situation is examined more closely. We focus on three
subjective tasks (Sentiment Analysis, Emotion Analysis, and Toxicity Detection)
and find significant challenges in data availability and quality, despite the
overall increase in data availability. We review 110 publications on subjective
tasks in Farsi and observe a lack of publicly available datasets. Furthermore,
existing datasets often lack essential demographic factors, such as age and
gender, that are crucial for accurately modeling subjectivity in language. When
evaluating prediction models using the few available datasets, the results are
highly unstable across both datasets and models. Our findings indicate that the
volume of data is insufficient to significantly improve a language's prospects
in NLP.

Motivation: 利用量子计算的独特特性来编码和理解自然语言的复杂性，特别是解决低资源语言数据缺乏的问题，探索量子自然语言处理在实际语言任务中的应用潜力。

Method: 提出QCSE量子上下文敏感嵌入模型，采用量子原生上下文学习方法，设计了5种不同的上下文矩阵计算方法（指数衰减、正弦调制、相位偏移、哈希变换等），在富拉尼语和英语语料上进行评估。

Result: QCSE成功捕获了上下文敏感性，并利用量子系统的表达能力表示丰富的上下文感知语言信息，特别是在低资源的富拉尼语上表现出色，证明了QNLP在解决数据缺乏问题方面的潜力。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了量子计算在自然语言处理中的强大能力，为将QNLP应用于各种任务和领域的实际语言挑战开辟了新途径，展示了量子系统在语言表示方面的价值。

Abstract: Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) offers a novel approach to
encoding and understanding the complexity of natural languages through the
power of quantum computation. This paper presents a pretrained quantum
context-sensitive embedding model, called QCSE, that captures context-sensitive
word embeddings, leveraging the unique properties of quantum systems to learn
contextual relationships in languages. The model introduces quantum-native
context learning, enabling the utilization of quantum computers for linguistic
tasks. Central to the proposed approach are innovative context matrix
computation methods, designed to create unique, representations of words based
on their surrounding linguistic context. Five distinct methods are proposed and
tested for computing the context matrices, incorporating techniques such as
exponential decay, sinusoidal modulation, phase shifts, and hash-based
transformations. These methods ensure that the quantum embeddings retain
context sensitivity, thereby making them suitable for downstream language tasks
where the expressibility and properties of quantum systems are valuable
resources. To evaluate the effectiveness of the model and the associated
context matrix methods, evaluations are conducted on both a Fulani corpus, a
low-resource African language, dataset of small size and an English corpus of
slightly larger size. The results demonstrate that QCSE not only captures
context sensitivity but also leverages the expressibility of quantum systems
for representing rich, context-aware language information. The use of Fulani
further highlights the potential of QNLP to mitigate the problem of lack of
data for this category of languages. This work underscores the power of quantum
computation in natural language processing (NLP) and opens new avenues for
applying QNLP to real-world linguistic challenges across various tasks and
domains.

empowers LLMs to critically self-examine and revise their intermediate

Motivation: 开发一个能够在跨语言语音翻译中保持源说话人身份特征的多语言TTS模型，解决传统方法在说话人身份保持方面的不足。

Method: 采用12层仅解码器Transformer架构，进行三阶段训练：文本到音频映射预训练、零样本语音克隆监督微调、基于WER和说话人相似度指标的DPO对齐优化。

Result: DPO训练显著降低了词错误率(WER)并提高了客观相似度指标。人工评估显示比强基线XTTSv2具有更好的感知说话人相似度，但客观与主观指标存在差距。

Conclusion: LatinX在跨语言说话人身份保持方面表现优异，未来工作需要平衡偏好信号和开发低延迟架构。

Abstract: We present LatinX, a multilingual text-to-speech (TTS) model for cascaded
speech-to-speech translation that preserves the source speaker's identity
across languages. LatinX is a 12-layer decoder-only Transformer trained in
three stages: (i) pre-training for text-to-audio mapping, (ii) supervised
fine-tuning for zero-shot voice cloning, and (iii) alignment with Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) using automatically labeled pairs based on Word
Error Rate (WER) and speaker-similarity metrics. Trained on English and Romance
languages with emphasis on Portuguese, LatinX with DPO consistently reduces WER
and improves objective similarity over the fine-tuned baseline. Human
evaluations further indicate stronger perceived speaker similarity than a
strong baseline (XTTSv2), revealing gaps between objective and subjective
measures. We provide cross-lingual analyses and discuss balanced preference
signals and lower-latency architectures as future work.

Conclusion: 该框架通过知识检索与模型微调的结合，有效减少母型错误和幻觉现象，提高了中医方前生成的质量和可解释性

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formulas play a significant role in
treating epidemics and complex diseases. Existing models for TCM utilize
traditional algorithms or deep learning techniques to analyze formula
relationships, yet lack comprehensive results, such as complete formula
compositions and detailed explanations. Although recent efforts have used TCM
instruction datasets to fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) for explainable
formula generation, existing datasets lack sufficient details, such as the
roles of the formula's sovereign, minister, assistant, courier; efficacy;
contraindications; tongue and pulse diagnosis-limiting the depth of model
outputs. To address these challenges, we propose ZhiFangDanTai, a framework
combining Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) with LLM
fine-tuning. ZhiFangDanTai uses GraphRAG to retrieve and synthesize structured
TCM knowledge into concise summaries, while also constructing an enhanced
instruction dataset to improve LLMs' ability to integrate retrieved
information. Furthermore, we provide novel theoretical proofs demonstrating
that integrating GraphRAG with fine-tuning techniques can reduce generalization
error and hallucination rates in the TCM formula task. Experimental results on
both collected and clinical datasets demonstrate that ZhiFangDanTai achieves
significant improvements over state-of-the-art models. Our model is

Abstract: Evaluating factual accuracy in Large Language Model (LLM)-generated clinical
text is a critical barrier to adoption, as expert review is unscalable for the
continuous quality assurance these systems require. We address this challenge
with two complementary contributions. First, we introduce MedFactEval, a
framework for scalable, fact-grounded evaluation where clinicians define
high-salience key facts and an "LLM Jury"--a multi-LLM majority vote--assesses
their inclusion in generated summaries. Second, we present MedAgentBrief, a
model-agnostic, multi-step workflow designed to generate high-quality, factual
discharge summaries. To validate our evaluation framework, we established a
gold-standard reference using a seven-physician majority vote on
clinician-defined key facts from inpatient cases. The MedFactEval LLM Jury
achieved almost perfect agreement with this panel (Cohen's kappa=81%), a
performance statistically non-inferior to that of a single human expert
(kappa=67%, P < 0.001). Our work provides both a robust evaluation framework
(MedFactEval) and a high-performing generation workflow (MedAgentBrief),
offering a comprehensive approach to advance the responsible deployment of
generative AI in clinical workflows.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) integrate into diverse workflows, they are
increasingly being considered "collaborators" with humans. If such AI
collaborators are to be reliable, their behavior over multiturn interactions
must be predictable, validated and verified before deployment. Common alignment
techniques are typically developed under simplified single-user settings and do
not account for the dynamics of long-horizon multiparty interactions. This
paper examines how different alignment methods affect LLM agents' effectiveness
as partners in multiturn, multiparty collaborations. We study this question
through the lens of friction agents that intervene in group dialogues to
encourage the collaborative group to slow down and reflect upon their reasoning
for deliberative decision-making. Using a roleplay methodology, we evaluate
interventions from differently-trained friction agents in collaborative task
conversations. We propose a novel counterfactual evaluation framework that
quantifies how friction interventions change the trajectory of group
collaboration and belief alignment. Our results show that a friction-aware
approach significantly outperforms common alignment baselines in helping both
convergence to a common ground, or agreed-upon task-relevant propositions, and
correctness of task outcomes.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过从粗细到细的三级语义相关性聚合和组内竞争筛选机制，提出PSC-Joint方法来精准整合最相关的偏向信息，提升长偏向列表情况下的上下文ASR性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨注意力上下文ASR模型在偏向列表长度增加时性能会下降，而实际上只有少量偏向信息与具体ASR中间表征最相关

Method: 提出PSC-Joint方法，定义和计算三级语义相关性（列表级、短语级、标记级），聚合形成交集来突出最相关偏向信息，并使用组内竞争筛选机制降低计算成本

Result: 在AISHELL-1和KeSpeech数据集上，对不同长度偏向列表均实现显著提升，F1分数相对攻劫收益分别达到21.34%和28.46%

Conclusion: PSC-Joint通过精准整合最相关偏向信息而非全部列表，有效缓解了偏向信息量变化对上下文ASR性能的影响，具有较高的效率和效果

Abstract: Recently, cross-attention-based contextual automatic speech recognition (ASR)
models have made notable advancements in recognizing personalized biasing
phrases. However, the effectiveness of cross-attention is affected by
variations in biasing information volume, especially when the length of the
biasing list increases significantly. We find that, regardless of the length of
the biasing list, only a limited amount of biasing information is most relevant
to a specific ASR intermediate representation. Therefore, by identifying and
integrating the most relevant biasing information rather than the entire
biasing list, we can alleviate the effects of variations in biasing information
volume for contextual ASR. To this end, we propose a purified semantic
correlation joint modeling (PSC-Joint) approach. In PSC-Joint, we define and
calculate three semantic correlations between the ASR intermediate
representations and biasing information from coarse to fine: list-level,
phrase-level, and token-level. Then, the three correlations are jointly modeled
to produce their intersection, so that the most relevant biasing information
across various granularities is highlighted and integrated for contextual
recognition. In addition, to reduce the computational cost introduced by the
joint modeling of three semantic correlations, we also propose a purification
mechanism based on a grouped-and-competitive strategy to filter out irrelevant
biasing phrases. Compared with baselines, our PSC-Joint approach achieves
average relative F1 score improvements of up to 21.34% on AISHELL-1 and 28.46%
on KeSpeech, across biasing lists of varying lengths.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型计算成本高，尤其是进行式计算方法在批量推理中引入的动态性可能造成系统瓶颈，反而降低速度

Method: 提出高效并行解码机制、深度参数共享架构以减轻同步问题，以及轻量路由器预训练动态分配递归深度

Result: 建立了效率与性能之间的新帕索托边界，在单个模型中同时优化了进行式计算和参数效率

Conclusion: 通过算法与架构的协同设计，成功解决了动态计算方法的系统性能问题，为大语言模型的高效部署提供了可行方案

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable capabilities, but their
practical deployment is hindered by significant computational costs. While
adaptive computation methods like early-exiting promise to reduce these costs,
they introduce a fundamental conflict: the per-token dynamism intended to save
computation often creates system-level bottlenecks that can paradoxically
reduce throughput in batched inference. This dissertation resolves this
conflict by co-designing adaptive algorithms and model architectures to strike
an optimal balance between dynamism and efficiency. To this end, our work first
addresses critical sources of overhead in conventional early-exiting by
proposing an efficient parallel decoding mechanism. We then show that deep
parameter sharing provides an architectural foundation that not only yields
compact, parameter-efficient models but also inherently mitigates the critical
synchronization issues affecting dynamic inference. Finally, this work presents
a unified framework where lightweight routers are pretrained to dynamically
assign an optimal recursion depth for each token. This approach establishes a
new Pareto frontier between efficiency and performance by effectively
optimizing for both adaptive computation and parameter efficiency within a
single model.

TL;DR: KatotohananQA是TruthfulQA基准的菲律宾语翻译版本，用于评估LLM在低资源语言中的真实性表现。研究发现英语和菲律宾语之间存在显著性能差距，新OpenAI模型展现多语言鲁棒性，但不同问题类型存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在低资源语言中的真实性评估存在空白，现有基准主要针对英语，需要开发多语言评估工具来确保LLM的公平性和可靠性。

Method: 将TruthfulQA基准翻译成菲律宾语(KatotohananQA)，使用二元选择框架评估7个免费专有模型，比较英语和菲律宾语版本的表现差异。

Result: 英语和菲律宾语真实性表现存在显著差距，新OpenAI模型(GPT-5系列)展现较强多语言鲁棒性，不同问题类型、类别和主题的跨语言迁移效果存在差异。

Conclusion: 需要更广泛的多语言评估来确保LLM使用的公平性和可靠性，某些问题类型在多语言迁移中表现较弱，凸显了多语言基准的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across various
tasks, but their tendency to produce hallucinations limits reliable adoption.
Benchmarks such as TruthfulQA have been developed to measure truthfulness, yet
they are primarily available in English, leaving a gap in evaluating LLMs in
low-resource languages. To address this, we present KatotohananQA, a Filipino
translation of the TruthfulQA benchmark. Seven free-tier proprietary models
were assessed using a binary-choice framework. Findings show a significant
performance gap between English and Filipino truthfulness, with newer OpenAI
models (GPT-5 and GPT-5 mini) demonstrating strong multilingual robustness.
Results also reveal disparities across question characteristics, suggesting
that some question types, categories, and topics are less robust to
multilingual transfer which highlight the need for broader multilingual
evaluation to ensure fairness and reliability in LLM usage.

TL;DR: MFCIG-CSS是一个基于多模态细粒度上下文交互图的对话语音合成系统，通过构建语义和韵律两个细粒度交互图来提升对话语音的自然韵律表达。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话语音合成方法主要关注话语级别的交互特征建模，忽略了多模态对话历史中词级别的细粒度语义和韵律知识，导致生成的语音韵律不够自然。

Method: 构建两个多模态细粒度对话交互图：语义交互图和韵律交互图，编码词级别语义、韵律及其对后续话语影响的交互特征，利用这些特征增强合成语音的对话韵律。

Result: 在DailyTalk数据集上的实验表明，MFCIG-CSS在韵律表达性方面优于所有基线模型。

Conclusion: 提出的细粒度上下文交互图方法能有效提升对话语音合成的韵律自然度，证明了词级别多模态交互建模的重要性。

Abstract: Conversational Speech Synthesis (CSS) aims to generate speech with natural
prosody by understanding the multimodal dialogue history (MDH). The latest work
predicts the accurate prosody expression of the target utterance by modeling
the utterance-level interaction characteristics of MDH and the target
utterance. However, MDH contains fine-grained semantic and prosody knowledge at
the word level. Existing methods overlook the fine-grained semantic and
prosodic interaction modeling. To address this gap, we propose MFCIG-CSS, a
novel Multimodal Fine-grained Context Interaction Graph-based CSS system. Our
approach constructs two specialized multimodal fine-grained dialogue
interaction graphs: a semantic interaction graph and a prosody interaction
graph. These two interaction graphs effectively encode interactions between
word-level semantics, prosody, and their influence on subsequent utterances in
MDH. The encoded interaction features are then leveraged to enhance synthesized
speech with natural conversational prosody. Experiments on the DailyTalk
dataset demonstrate that MFCIG-CSS outperforms all baseline models in terms of
prosodic expressiveness. Code and speech samples are available at
https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/MFCIG-CSS.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OLieRA是一种新的连续学习框架，通过李群理论和乘法更新来保持LLM参数几何结构，同时在任务子空间应用正交约束，解决了传统方法破坏参数几何结构的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数正则化方法（如O-LoRA和N-LoRA）虽然通过强制低秩子空间正交性来减轻任务干扰，但忽略了传统加法微调会破坏LLM参数固有几何结构的问题，限制了性能。

Method: 提出OLieRA方法，将李群理论引入LLM微调：利用乘法更新来保持参数几何结构，同时对任务子空间应用正交约束。

Result: 实验表明，OLieRA在标准连续学习基准上取得了最先进的结果，在大量任务设置中仍保持顶级性能。

Conclusion: 保持LLM参数空间的几何结构对于连续学习至关重要，OLieRA通过结合李群理论和正交约束，有效缓解了灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are prone to catastrophic forgetting in
sequential multi-task settings. Parameter regularization methods such as O-LoRA
and N-LoRA alleviate task interference by enforcing low-rank subspace
orthogonality, but they overlook the fact that conventional additive
fine-tuning disrupts the intrinsic geometric structure of LLM parameters,
limiting performance. Our key insight is that the parameter space of LLMs
possesses a geometric structure, which must be preserved in addition to
enforcing orthogonality. Based on this, we propose Orthogonal Low-rank
Adaptation in Lie Groups (OLieRA), which introduces Lie group theory into LLM
fine-tuning: leveraging multiplicative updates to preserve parameter geometry
while applying orthogonality constraints to task subspaces. Experiments
demonstrate that OLieRA achieves state-of-the-art results on the Standard CL
benchmark and remains among the top-performing methods in the Large Number of
Tasks setting.

TL;DR: EuroParlVote是一个用于评估LLM在政治敏感语境中表现的新基准，包含欧洲议会辩论演讲与投票结果的关联数据，揭示了LLM在性别分类和投票预测任务中存在系统性偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要评估大型语言模型在政治敏感语境中的表现，特别是在涉及性别、政治立场等敏感信息时的偏见问题，以促进NLP领域的公平性和问责制研究。

Method: 构建EuroParlVote数据集，链接欧洲议会辩论演讲与投票结果，包含丰富的议员人口统计数据。使用该数据集评估最先进LLM在性别分类和投票预测两个任务上的表现。

Result: 发现LLM存在系统性偏见：经常将女性议员误分类为男性；在模拟女性演讲者投票时准确率降低；政治倾向上偏向中间派，在极左和极右群体上表现较差；专有模型（如GPT-4o）在鲁棒性和公平性方面优于开源模型。

Conclusion: LLM在政治敏感语境中存在显著的偏见问题，需要进一步研究以提高公平性。EuroParlVote数据集、代码和演示已发布，以支持未来在政治语境中NLP公平性和问责制的研究。

Abstract: We introduce EuroParlVote, a novel benchmark for evaluating large language
models (LLMs) in politically sensitive contexts. It links European Parliament
debate speeches to roll-call vote outcomes and includes rich demographic
metadata for each Member of the European Parliament (MEP), such as gender, age,
country, and political group. Using EuroParlVote, we evaluate state-of-the-art
LLMs on two tasks -- gender classification and vote prediction -- revealing
consistent patterns of bias. We find that LLMs frequently misclassify female
MEPs as male and demonstrate reduced accuracy when simulating votes for female
speakers. Politically, LLMs tend to favor centrist groups while underperforming
on both far-left and far-right ones. Proprietary models like GPT-4o outperform
open-weight alternatives in terms of both robustness and fairness. We release
the EuroParlVote dataset, code, and demo to support future research on fairness
and accountability in NLP within political contexts.

Motivation: 当前文本嵌入器的发展依赖于大量LLM生成的合成数据，但缺乏公开的合成数据集阻碍了对其作用的研究。

Method: 首先复现并公开采用Wang等人的Mistral-E5合成数据，然后分析合成数据在不同任务上的幻性化效果。

Result: 合成数据能提高性能，但改善效果寄存于特定数据集，不同任务间存在性能折扣，合成数据并不能提升模型的通用性。

Conclusion: 当前的合成数据方法在建立通用嵌入器方面有限，训练合成数据并不能得到更健壮的模型。

Abstract: Recent progress in developing general purpose text embedders has been driven
by training on ever-growing corpora of synthetic LLM-generated data.
Nonetheless, no publicly available synthetic dataset exists, posing a barrier
to studying its role for generalization. To address this issue, we first
reproduce and publicly release the synthetic data proposed by Wang et al.
(Mistral-E5). Our synthetic data is high quality and leads to consistent
improvements in performance. Next, we critically examine where exactly
synthetic data improves model generalization. Our analysis reveals that
benefits from synthetic data are sparse and highly localized to individual
datasets. Moreover, we observe trade-offs between the performance on different
categories and data that benefits one task, degrades performance on another.
Our findings highlight the limitations of current synthetic data approaches for
building general-purpose embedders and challenge the notion that training on
synthetic data leads to more robust embedding models across tasks.

introduces a novel methodology. Training fine-tuned LLMs specifically tuned for
recruitment tasks. The proposed framework addresses the limitations of generic
LLMs by creating a synthetic dataset that uses a standardized JSON format. This

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GCG越狱攻击方法使用固定长度的后缀，但其中可能存在令牌冗余问题未被探索，需要一种方法来识别和修剪低影响力令牌以提高效率。

Method: 提出Mask-GCG方法，使用可学习的令牌掩码技术来识别后缀中高影响力位置的令牌，增加这些位置的更新概率，同时修剪低影响力位置的令牌。

Result: 实验结果表明，后缀中大多数令牌对攻击成功有显著贡献，修剪少数低影响力令牌不会影响损失值或攻击成功率，揭示了LLM提示中的令牌冗余现象。

Conclusion: Mask-GCG方法有效减少了计算开销和攻击时间，同时保持攻击效果，为从越狱攻击角度开发高效和可解释的LLM提供了见解。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated various
successful methods whereby attackers manipulate models into generating harmful
responses that they are designed to avoid. Among these, Greedy Coordinate
Gradient (GCG) has emerged as a general and effective approach that optimizes
the tokens in a suffix to generate jailbreakable prompts. While several
improved variants of GCG have been proposed, they all rely on fixed-length
suffixes. However, the potential redundancy within these suffixes remains
unexplored. In this work, we propose Mask-GCG, a plug-and-play method that
employs learnable token masking to identify impactful tokens within the suffix.
Our approach increases the update probability for tokens at high-impact
positions while pruning those at low-impact positions. This pruning not only
reduces redundancy but also decreases the size of the gradient space, thereby
lowering computational overhead and shortening the time required to achieve
successful attacks compared to GCG. We evaluate Mask-GCG by applying it to the
original GCG and several improved variants. Experimental results show that most
tokens in the suffix contribute significantly to attack success, and pruning a
minority of low-impact tokens does not affect the loss values or compromise the
attack success rate (ASR), thereby revealing token redundancy in LLM prompts.
Our findings provide insights for developing efficient and interpretable LLMs
from the perspective of jailbreak attacks.

TL;DR: PL-CA提出参数化RAG框架，将法律知识编码到参数向量中并通过LoRA集成到LLM的前馈网络中，缓解模型上下文压力，同时在多任务法律数据集上保持竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法直接将检索文档注入模型上下文，受限于有限的上下文窗口，引入额外计算开销并干扰模型注意力，影响下游任务性能。现有基准缺乏专家标注且仅关注单一任务，无法反映真实法律场景中的多任务混合需求。

Method: 提出参数化RAG(P-RAG)框架，对语料知识进行数据增强并编码为参数向量，通过LoRA将参数化知识集成到LLM的前馈网络(FFN)中。构建包含2000+专家标注实例的多任务法律数据集。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在减少过长上下文开销的同时，在下游任务上相比传统RAG保持竞争性能。

Conclusion: PL-CA通过参数化知识集成有效缓解了模型上下文压力，为法律领域的知识增强提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Conventional RAG is considered one of the most effective methods for
addressing model knowledge insufficiency and hallucination, particularly in the
judicial domain that requires high levels of knowledge rigor, logical
consistency, and content integrity. However, the conventional RAG method only
injects retrieved documents directly into the model's context, which severely
constrains models due to their limited context windows and introduces
additional computational overhead through excessively long contexts, thereby
disrupting models' attention and degrading performance on downstream tasks.
Moreover, many existing benchmarks lack expert annotation and focus solely on
individual downstream tasks while real-world legal scenarios consist of
multiple mixed legal tasks, indicating conventional benchmarks' inadequacy for
reflecting models' true capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose
PL-CA, which introduces a parametric RAG (P-RAG) framework to perform data
augmentation on corpus knowledge and encode this legal knowledge into
parametric vectors, and then integrates this parametric knowledge into the
LLM's feed-forward networks (FFN) via LoRA, thereby alleviating models' context
pressure. Additionally, we also construct a multi-task legal dataset comprising
more than 2000 training and test instances, which are all expert-annotated and
manually verified. We conduct our experiments on our dataset, and the
experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces the overhead
associated with excessively long contexts while maintaining competitive
performance on downstream tasks compared to conventional RAG. Our code and
dataset are provided in the appendix.

LLM-as-a-judge approaches (using Prometheus and JudgeLM), and human
annotations. Results consistently show superior performance in English, with
significantly lower performance in less-resourced languages. While contextual
support yields mixed results, it tends to benefit underrepresented languages.

TL;DR: WebExplorer-8B是一个8B参数的网络代理模型，通过创新的数据生成方法和强化学习训练，在复杂信息搜索任务中实现了最先进的性能，甚至超越了更大规模的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源网络代理在复杂任务上的信息搜索能力有限，且缺乏透明实现，主要挑战在于缺乏具有挑战性的信息搜索数据。

Method: 提出WebExplorer数据生成方法，使用基于模型的探索和迭代式长到短查询演化来创建需要多步推理和复杂网络导航的查询-答案对，然后通过监督微调和强化学习训练模型。

Result: WebExplorer-8B支持128K上下文长度和100个工具调用轮次，在多个信息搜索基准测试中达到同规模最佳性能，在BrowseComp-en/zh上超越WebSailor-72B，在WebWalkerQA和FRAMES上达到100B参数以下模型的最佳性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为长视野网络代理的发展提供了实用路径，模型在仅使用知识密集型QA数据训练的情况下，在HLE基准测试中也表现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: The paradigm of Large Language Models (LLMs) has increasingly shifted toward
agentic applications, where web browsing capabilities are fundamental for
retrieving information from diverse online sources. However, existing
open-source web agents either demonstrate limited information-seeking abilities
on complex tasks or lack transparent implementations. In this work, we identify
that the key challenge lies in the scarcity of challenging data for information
seeking. To address this limitation, we introduce WebExplorer: a systematic
data generation approach using model-based exploration and iterative,
long-to-short query evolution. This method creates challenging query-answer
pairs that require multi-step reasoning and complex web navigation. By
leveraging our curated high-quality dataset, we successfully develop advanced
web agent WebExplorer-8B through supervised fine-tuning followed by
reinforcement learning. Our model supports 128K context length and up to 100
tool calling turns, enabling long-horizon problem solving. Across diverse
information-seeking benchmarks, WebExplorer-8B achieves the state-of-the-art
performance at its scale. Notably, as an 8B-sized model, WebExplorer-8B is able
to effectively search over an average of 16 turns after RL training, achieving
higher accuracy than WebSailor-72B on BrowseComp-en/zh and attaining the best
performance among models up to 100B parameters on WebWalkerQA and FRAMES.
Beyond these information-seeking tasks, our model also achieves strong
generalization on the HLE benchmark even though it is only trained on
knowledge-intensive QA data. These results highlight our approach as a
practical path toward long-horizon web agents.

*Andrei Baroian,Kasper Notebomer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文探索了Transformer模型层次缩放策略，提出了三种新的层级缩放方案，在固定参数预算下实现了更好的性能而不影响训练速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer模型采用均匀的层大小，忽视了不同深度层在功能角色和计算需求上的差异性。需要探索更灵活的层级缩放策略来提高效率。

Method: 基于层级缩放(LWS)和剪枝技术，提出了三种新的LWS变体（Framed、Reverse和Crown），通过二点或三点线性插值重新分配FFN宽度和关注头数。在180M参数和5B标签的固定预算下进行系统性对比实验。

Result: 所有模型都收敛到相似的损失值，且都比等成本的均匀基准模型表现更好，同时没有导致训练速度的显著下降。

Conclusion: 这项工作是预训练阶段层级架构设计的初步探索，未来需要在更大规模的标签和参数上扩展实验以全面评估其潜力。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models traditionally use uniform (isotropic) layer
sizes, yet they ignore the diverse functional roles that different depths can
play and their computational capacity needs. Building on Layer-Wise Scaling
(LWS) and pruning literature, we introduce three new LWS variants - Framed,
Reverse, and Crown - that redistribute FFN widths and attention heads via two
or three-point linear interpolation in the pre-training stage. We present the
first systematic ablation of LWS and its variants, on a fixed budget of 180M
parameters, trained on 5B tokens. All models converge to similar losses and
achieve better performance compared to an equal-cost isotropic baseline,
without a substantial decrease in training throughput. This work represents an
initial step into the design space of layer-wise architectures for
pre-training, but future work should scale experiments to orders of magnitude
more tokens and parameters to fully assess their potential.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LAMDAS是一种利用预训练LLM作为隐式分类器进行领域特定数据选择的新方法，通过将数据选择重构为单类分类问题，仅使用少量参考数据就能高效筛选高质量训练数据，在性能和计算效率方面都优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 领域适配LLM面临高质量人工标注数据稀缺的问题，大量未检查数据直接用于微调会引入噪声导致性能下降。现有数据选择方法无法同时满足准确性和效率要求。

Method: LAMDAS将预训练LLM本身作为隐式分类器，避免显式特征工程和计算密集型优化过程。将数据选择重构为单类分类问题，通过少量参考数据集识别属于目标域的候选数据。

Result: 实验结果表明，LAMDAS不仅使用少量数据就能超越全数据训练的性能，还在各种场景下优于9个SOTA基线方法，在性能增益和计算效率之间达到了最佳平衡。

Conclusion: LAMDAS提供了一种高效准确的领域特定数据选择方法，通过利用LLM自身的隐式分类能力，解决了高质量训练数据稀缺和计算效率的问题，为LLM领域适配提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Adapting large language models (LLMs) to specific domains often faces a
critical bottleneck: the scarcity of high-quality, human-curated data. While
large volumes of unchecked data are readily available, indiscriminately using
them for fine-tuning risks introducing noise and degrading performance.
Strategic data selection is thus crucial, requiring a method that is both
accurate and efficient. Existing approaches, categorized as similarity-based
and direct optimization methods, struggle to simultaneously achieve these
goals. In this paper, we introduce LAMDAS (LLM As an iMplicit classifier for
domain-specific DAta Selection), a novel approach that leverages the
pre-trained LLM itself as an implicit classifier, thereby bypassing explicit
feature engineering and computationally intensive optimization process. LAMDAS
reframes data selection as a one-class classification problem, identifying
candidate data that "belongs" to the target domain defined by a small reference
dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that LAMDAS not only
exceeds the performance of full-data training using a fraction of the data but
also outperforms nine state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines under various
scenarios. Furthermore, LAMDAS achieves the most compelling balance between
performance gains and computational efficiency compared to all evaluated
baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLiNT是一个结构感知的语言模型框架，通过注入知识图谱结构信息和对比学习来解决链接预测中的结构稀疏性和语义模糊性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在知识图谱链接预测中虽然具有强大的生成推理能力，但对结构信号的利用有限，导致结构稀疏和语义模糊问题，特别是在不完全或零样本设置下。

Method: 提出SLiNT框架：1）结构引导邻域增强(SGNE)检索伪邻居丰富稀疏实体；2）动态硬对比学习(DHCL)通过插值硬正负样本来解决实体级模糊性；3）梯度解耦双注入(GDDI)进行token级结构感知干预同时保持核心LLM参数。

Result: 在WN18RR和FB15k-237数据集上的实验表明，SLiNT相比基于嵌入和基于生成的基线方法取得了优越或竞争性的性能。

Conclusion: 证明了结构感知表示学习对于可扩展知识图谱补全的有效性。

Abstract: Link prediction in knowledge graphs requires integrating structural
information and semantic context to infer missing entities. While large
language models offer strong generative reasoning capabilities, their limited
exploitation of structural signals often results in structural sparsity and
semantic ambiguity, especially under incomplete or zero-shot settings. To
address these challenges, we propose SLiNT (Structure-aware Language model with
Injection and coNtrastive Training), a modular framework that injects
knowledge-graph-derived structural context into a frozen LLM backbone with
lightweight LoRA-based adaptation for robust link prediction. Specifically,
Structure-Guided Neighborhood Enhancement (SGNE) retrieves pseudo-neighbors to
enrich sparse entities and mitigate missing context; Dynamic Hard Contrastive
Learning (DHCL) introduces fine-grained supervision by interpolating hard
positives and negatives to resolve entity-level ambiguity; and
Gradient-Decoupled Dual Injection (GDDI) performs token-level structure-aware
intervention while preserving the core LLM parameters. Experiments on WN18RR
and FB15k-237 show that SLiNT achieves superior or competitive performance
compared with both embedding-based and generation-based baselines,
demonstrating the effectiveness of structure-aware representation learning for
scalable knowledge graph completion.

### [48] [HAVE: Head-Adaptive Gating and ValuE Calibration for Hallucination Mitigation in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06596)
*Xin Tong,Zhi Lin,Jingya Wang,Bo Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HAVE是一个无需微调的参数自由解码框架，通过头自适应门控和价值校准来解决LLM幻觉问题，在单次前向传播中有效减少幻觉并提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在检索增强生成长上下文时经常产生幻觉，即使相关证据存在。这源于两个问题：头重要性被处理为输入无关的，原始注意力权重不能很好反映每个token的真实贡献。

Method: HAVE框架包含头自适应门控（实例级软重加权注意力头）和价值校准（通过价值向量大小增强注意力以近似写回贡献），通过轻量级不确定性缩放策略将token级证据与语言模型分布融合。

Result: 在多个QA基准测试和不同LLM家族上的实验表明，HAVE持续减少幻觉并优于包括DAGCD在内的强基线方法，且开销适中。

Conclusion: HAVE框架透明、可复现，能够轻松集成到现成的LLM中，推进了真实场景中可信生成的发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce hallucinations in
retrieval-augmented or long-context generation, even when relevant evidence is
present. This stems from two issues: head importance is treated as
input-agnostic, and raw attention weights poorly reflect each token's true
contribution. We present HAVE (Head-Adaptive Gating and ValuE Calibration), a
parameter-free decoding framework that directly addresses both challenges. HAVE
introduces head-adaptive gating, which performs instance-level soft reweighing
of attention heads, and value calibration, which augments attention with the
magnitude of value vectors to approximate write-back contribution. Together,
these modules construct token-level evidence aligned with model updates and
fuse it with the LM distribution through a lightweight uncertainty-scaled
policy. HAVE requires no finetuning and operates in a single forward pass,
making it efficient and broadly applicable. Experiments across multiple QA
benchmarks and LLM families demonstrate that HAVE consistently reduces
hallucinations and outperforms strong baselines, including DAGCD, with modest
overhead. The framework is transparent, reproducible, and readily integrates
with off-the-shelf LLMs, advancing trustworthy generation in real-world
settings.

Result: 发现多轮交互对引导解码性能有显著影响，存在意外的性能变化

Conclusion: 该研究提供了RAG系统中结构化输出生成的理论见解和实践指南，为LLM部署方法选择提供了指导

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into various applications has
driven the need for structured and reliable responses. A key challenge in
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems is ensuring that outputs align
with expected formats while minimizing hallucinations. This study examines the
role of guided decoding in RAG systems, comparing three methods, Outlines,
XGrammar, and LM Format Enforcer, across different multi-turn prompting setups
(0-turn, 1-turn, and 2-turn). By evaluating success rates, hallucination rates,
and output quality, we provide insights into their performance and
applicability. Our findings reveal how multi-turn interactions influence guided
decoding, uncovering unexpected performance variations that can inform method
selection for specific use cases. This work advances the understanding of
structured output generation in RAG systems, offering both theoretical insights
and practical guidance for LLM deployment.

Motivation: 互文性是文学研究中的核心概念，但缺乏可扩展的量化分析方法，需要一种能够大规模分析文本互文关系的方法。

Method: 使用n-gram嵌入进行文本对比较，计算嵌入间的相似度并取平均值作为整体互文性得分。

Result: 在4个已知互文性程度的文本上验证有效，并在267个多样化文本上测试了可扩展性，网络分析揭示了中心性和社区结构。

Conclusion: 该方法成功捕捉和量化了互文关系，为大规模文学文本分析提供了有效的量化工具。

Abstract: Intertextuality is a central tenet in literary studies. It refers to the
intricate links between literary texts that are created by various types of
references. This paper proposes a new quantitative model of intertextuality to
enable scalable analysis and network-based insights: perform pairwise
comparisons of the embeddings of n-grams from two texts and average their
results as the overall intertextuality. Validation on four texts with known
degrees of intertextuality, alongside a scalability test on 267 diverse texts,
demonstrates the method's effectiveness and efficiency. Network analysis
further reveals centrality and community structures, affirming the approach's
success in capturing and quantifying intertextual relationships.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统的粗排序优化方法难以平衡领域特定知识学习和查询增强，导致检索性能不理想

Method: 两阶段管道：1）使用混合损失（MoL）的持续预训练阶段平衡领域知识和通用语言能力；2）使用组相对策略优化（GRPO）的强化学习阶段优化查询和段落生成以最大化文档召回率。创新包括多查询单段落后期融合（MSLF）策略

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，MoLER实现了最先进的性能，显著优于基线方法

Conclusion: MoLER弥合了RAG系统中的知识差距，能够在专业领域实现鲁棒且可扩展的检索

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely heavily on the retrieval
stage, particularly the coarse-ranking process. Existing coarse-ranking
optimization approaches often struggle to balance domain-specific knowledge
learning with query enhencement, resulting in suboptimal retrieval performance.
To address this challenge, we propose MoLER, a domain-aware RAG method that
uses MoL-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning to optimize retrieval. MoLER has a
two-stage pipeline: a continual pre-training (CPT) phase using a Mixture of
Losses (MoL) to balance domain-specific knowledge with general language
capabilities, and a reinforcement learning (RL) phase leveraging Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) to optimize query and passage generation for
maximizing document recall. A key innovation is our Multi-query Single-passage
Late Fusion (MSLF) strategy, which reduces computational overhead during RL
training while maintaining scalable inference via Multi-query Multi-passage
Late Fusion (MMLF). Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that MoLER
achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming baseline
methods. MoLER bridges the knowledge gap in RAG systems, enabling robust and
scalable retrieval in specialized domains.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决教育对话中维持学习者参与度的挑战，填补关于对话中语言特征如何驱动参与度的研究空白。

Method: 基于TSCC语料库构建IntrEx数据集，采用比较式评分方法进行序列级标注，使用100多名二语学习者进行严格标注，并研究LLM预测人类趣味性判断的能力。

Result: 微调后的7B/8B参数LLM在预测趣味性方面表现优于GPT-4o等大型专有模型，证明了专业数据集在教育参与度建模方面的潜力。

Conclusion: 语言和认知因素（如具体性、可理解性和接受度）显著影响教育对话的参与度，专业数据集能够有效提升LLM在教育场景中的参与度建模能力。

Abstract: Engagement and motivation are crucial for second-language acquisition, yet
maintaining learner interest in educational conversations remains a challenge.
While prior research has explored what makes educational texts interesting,
still little is known about the linguistic features that drive engagement in
conversations. To address this gap, we introduce IntrEx, the first large
dataset annotated for interestingness and expected interestingness in
teacher-student interactions. Built upon the Teacher-Student Chatroom Corpus
(TSCC), IntrEx extends prior work by incorporating sequence-level annotations,
allowing for the study of engagement beyond isolated turns to capture how
interest evolves over extended dialogues. We employ a rigorous annotation
process with over 100 second-language learners, using a comparison-based rating
approach inspired by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to
improve agreement. We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can
predict human interestingness judgments. We find that LLMs (7B/8B parameters)
fine-tuned on interestingness ratings outperform larger proprietary models like
GPT-4o, demonstrating the potential for specialised datasets to model
engagement in educational settings. Finally, we analyze how linguistic and
cognitive factors, such as concreteness, comprehensibility (readability), and
uptake, influence engagement in educational dialogues.

Method: 评估了两种主要方法：通过价值预测推断主观性 vs 直接识别主观性。实验还测试了结合对比损失和二元交叉熵损失的方法。

Result: 直接主观性识别显著提高了模型标记主观论点的性能。结合对比损失和二元交叉熵损失虽然不能提升性能，但减少了对每个标签主观性的依赖。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有助于识别个体可能有不同解释的论点，促进更细致的标注过程。

Abstract: Aggregating multiple annotations into a single ground truth label may hide
valuable insights into annotator disagreement, particularly in tasks where
subjectivity plays a crucial role. In this work, we explore methods for
identifying subjectivity in recognizing the human values that motivate
arguments. We evaluate two main approaches: inferring subjectivity through
value prediction vs. directly identifying subjectivity. Our experiments show
that direct subjectivity identification significantly improves the model
performance of flagging subjective arguments. Furthermore, combining
contrastive loss with binary cross-entropy loss does not improve performance
but reduces the dependency on per-label subjectivity. Our proposed methods can
help identify arguments that individuals may interpret differently, fostering a
more nuanced annotation process.

TL;DR: IFT训练会损害LLM的安全拒绝能力，研究发现这是由于拒绝方向(r-direction)在训练中漂移导致的。提出的ProCon方法通过投影约束损失来缓解这种漂移，结合预热策略增强约束效果，显著降低安全风险同时保持任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指令微调(IFT)虽然能提升大语言模型的各种能力，但会显著损害模型的安全拒绝能力，特别是拒绝恶意指令的能力，这引发了严重的安全担忧。

Method: 提出ProCon方法：1）引入投影约束损失项，正则化训练样本隐藏状态在r-direction上的投影幅度；2）基于早期剧烈漂移观察，采用预热策略强调早期强约束；3）拓宽数据分布以增强约束信号。

Result: 在各种数据集、场景和LLM上的实验表明，该方法能显著降低IFT带来的安全风险，同时保持任务性能增益。与强基线相比，始终提供更优的整体性能。

Conclusion: ProCon有助于在训练过程中稳定r-direction，这种基于可解释性的LLM内部机制探索为未来的安全研究奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) has been widely adopted as an effective
post-training strategy to enhance various abilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, prior studies have shown that IFT can significantly compromise
LLMs' safety, particularly their ability to refuse malicious instructions,
raising significant concerns. Recent research into the internal mechanisms of
LLMs has identified the refusal direction (r-direction) in the hidden states,
which plays a pivotal role in governing refusal behavior. Building on this
insight, our study reveals that the r-direction tends to drift during training,
which we identify as one of the causes of the associated safety risks. To
mitigate such drift, our proposed ProCon method introduces a
projection-constrained loss term that regularizes the projection magnitude of
each training sample's hidden state onto the r-direction. Our initial analysis
shows that applying an appropriate constraint can effectively mitigate the
refusal direction drift and associated safety risks, but remains limited by
overall performance barriers. To overcome this barrier, informed by our
observation of early-stage sharp drift and a data-driven perspective, we
introduce a warm-up strategy that emphasizes early-stage strong constraints and
broaden the data distribution to strengthen constraint signals, leading to an
enhanced ProCon method. Experimental results under various datasets, scenarios,
and LLMs demonstrate that our method can significantly mitigate safety risks
posed by IFT while preserving task performance gains. Even compared with strong
baselines, our method consistently delivers superior overall performance.
Crucially, our analysis indicates that ProCon can contribute to stabilizing the
r-direction during training, while such an interpretability-driven exploration
of LLMs' internal mechanisms lays a solid foundation for future safety
research.

TL;DR: MachineLearningLM是一个持续预训练框架，通过合成数百万个结构因果模型任务来增强LLM的上下文机器学习能力，在少样本到1024样本范围内都表现出色，同时保持通用知识推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然具有广泛的世界知识和强大的通用推理能力，但在标准机器学习任务中难以通过纯上下文学习从大量样本中学习，需要提升其上下文机器学习能力。

Method: 使用随机森林教师模型，将基于树的决策策略蒸馏到LLM中，通过结构因果模型合成ML任务，采用token高效的提示序列化，支持批量推理实现3-6倍吞吐量提升。

Result: 在Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct模型上，平均比GPT-5-mini等强基线模型在跨域表格分类任务上提升约15%，在1024样本下达到随机森林级别的准确率，MMLU得分75.4%保持通用能力。

Conclusion: MachineLearningLM框架成功增强了LLM的上下文机器学习能力，展现出明显的多样本缩放规律，同时保持了模型的通用聊天能力，为LLM在ML任务中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess broad world knowledge and strong
general-purpose reasoning ability, yet they struggle to learn from many
in-context examples on standard machine learning (ML) tasks, that is, to
leverage many-shot demonstrations purely via in-context learning (ICL) without
gradient descent. We introduce MachineLearningLM, a portable
continued-pretraining framework that equips a general-purpose LLM with robust
in-context ML capability while preserving its general knowledge and reasoning
for broader chat workflows.
  Our pretraining procedure synthesizes ML tasks from millions of structural
causal models (SCMs), spanning shot counts up to 1,024. We begin with a
random-forest teacher, distilling tree-based decision strategies into the LLM
to strengthen robustness in numerical modeling. All tasks are serialized with a
token-efficient prompt, enabling 3x to 6x more examples per context window and
delivering up to 50x amortized throughput via batch inference.
  Despite a modest setup (Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct with LoRA rank 8),
MachineLearningLM outperforms strong LLM baselines (e.g., GPT-5-mini) by an
average of about 15% on out-of-distribution tabular classification across
finance, physics, biology, and healthcare domains. It exhibits a striking
many-shot scaling law: accuracy increases monotonically as in-context
demonstrations grow from 8 to 1,024. Without any task-specific training, it
attains random-forest-level accuracy across hundreds of shots. General chat
capabilities, including knowledge and reasoning, are preserved: it achieves
75.4% on MMLU.

Conclusion: MoGU_v2是一个强大且多功能的解决方案，能够有效缓解现实应用中的安全风险，在安全性和实用性之间实现了更好的平衡。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly permeate human life, their
security has emerged as a critical concern, particularly their ability to
maintain harmless responses to malicious instructions. Although extensive
methods have improved LLMs' security, they often lead to conservative,
rejection-oriented responses that compromise practical usability. This presents
a key challenge: how to advance the Pareto frontier between LLMs' usability and
security, rather than necessitate a trade-off between them. To address this, we
propose the MoGU framework, in which the intra-layer router dynamically
allocates weights by sensing hidden states, thereby balancing the contributions
of security-optimized and usability-optimized variants. Despite its initial
potential, the MoGU framework faces limitations such as parameter redundancy
and performance bottlenecks. To overcome these, we further propose an improved
MoGU_v2 framework that establishes a tighter coupling between the routers and
hidden states. In MoGU_v2, routers are embedded only in layers encoding highly
classifiable security features, and backbone modules are activated during
router optimization to enable bidirectional adaptation. MoGU_V2 exhibits strong
adaptability and stable improvements across various series of LLMs, including
mainstream LLMs serving as brains in various applications, on-device LLMs
optimized for resource-constrained scenarios, and reasoning LLMs tailored for
user interpretability. Meanwhile, even facing risks introduced by Instruction
Fine-tuning, MoGU_v2 can easily restore security without compromising the task
performance gains via a simple data-mix strategy. These comprehensive
improvements highlight MoGU_V2 as a robust and versatile solution for
mitigating security risks in real-world applications.

*Valentin Quesnel,Damien Sileo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 利用E-prover定理证明器从TPTP公理库自动生成大规模、保证正确的数学推理数据，创建了三个难度可控的挑战任务，发现前沿模型在深度结构化推理方面存在明显弱点


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量、逻辑正确的数据稀缺是提升大语言模型数学推理能力的关键瓶颈，需要可扩展的数据生成方法

Method: 基于E-prover的饱和能力，从TPTP公理库推导定理，过滤出"有趣"定理，生成三个任务：蕴含验证、前提选择和证明重构，完全避免使用LLM以确保正确性

Result: 零样本实验显示前沿模型在需要深度结构化推理的任务上表现崩溃，性能显著下降

Conclusion: 该框架既提供了诊断模型推理能力差距的工具，又提供了可扩展的符号训练数据来源，有助于解决数学推理的数据瓶颈问题

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality, logically sound data is a critical bottleneck
for advancing the mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our
work confronts this challenge by turning decades of automated theorem proving
research into a scalable data engine. Rather than relying on error-prone LLMs
or complex proof-assistant syntax like Lean and Isabelle, our framework
leverages E-prover's saturation capabilities on the vast TPTP axiom library to
derive a massive, guaranteed-valid corpus of theorems. Our pipeline is
principled and simple: saturate axioms, filter for "interesting" theorems, and
generate tasks. With no LLMs in the loop, we eliminate factual errors by
construction. This purely symbolic data is then transformed into three
difficulty-controlled challenges: entailment verification, premise selection,
and proof reconstruction. Our zero-shot experiments on frontier models reveal a
clear weakness: performance collapses on tasks requiring deep, structural
reasoning. Our framework provides both the diagnostic tool to measure this gap
and a scalable source of symbolic training data to address it. We make the code
and data publicly available.

*Max Malyi,Jonathan Shek,Alasdair McDonald,Andre Biscaya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个开源框架，用于基准测试大语言模型在风力汽车维护日志分类任务上的性能，并建议人在循环系统是最有效的应用方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 风电维护日志的非结构化特性导致自动化分析困难，需要一个可重现的基准测试框架来评估LLM在这些复杂工业记录上的表现。

Method: 开发了一个公开源框架，系统性评估多种商业和开源LLM的可靠性、运营效率和模型检验性能。

Result: 识别出了性能层次分明的顶级模型，还发现分类性能依赖于任务的语义模糊度，所有模型在对象性组件识别上表现更好。没有模型达到完美准确性，检验性能差异显著。

Conclusion: 最有效和负责任的应用方式是人在循环系统，LLM作为助手加速数据标注流程，提升O&M数据质量和可靠性分析。

Abstract: Effective Operation and Maintenance (O&M) is critical to reducing the
Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE) from wind power, yet the unstructured,
free-text nature of turbine maintenance logs presents a significant barrier to
automated analysis. Our paper addresses this by presenting a novel and
reproducible framework for benchmarking Large Language Models (LLMs) on the
task of classifying these complex industrial records. To promote transparency
and encourage further research, this framework has been made publicly available
as an open-source tool. We systematically evaluate a diverse suite of
state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LLMs, providing a foundational
assessment of their trade-offs in reliability, operational efficiency, and
model calibration. Our results quantify a clear performance hierarchy,
identifying top models that exhibit high alignment with a benchmark standard
and trustworthy, well-calibrated confidence scores. We also demonstrate that
classification performance is highly dependent on the task's semantic
ambiguity, with all models showing higher consensus on objective component
identification than on interpretive maintenance actions. Given that no model
achieves perfect accuracy and that calibration varies dramatically, we conclude
that the most effective and responsible near-term application is a
Human-in-the-Loop system, where LLMs act as a powerful assistant to accelerate
and standardise data labelling for human experts, thereby enhancing O&M data
quality and downstream reliability analysis.

### [60] [COMPACT: Common-token Optimized Model Pruning Across Channels and Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06836)
*Eugene Kwek,Wenpeng Yin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COMPACT是一种联合剪枝方法，通过剪枝稀有词汇表来缩小嵌入/解嵌入层，并使用基于常见token加权的激活值来剪枝FFN中间通道，在保持标准Transformer架构的同时实现高效压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 使LLM在内存、延迟和服务成本方面更高效，以支持边缘部署、交互式应用和大规模可持续推理。现有剪枝方法存在局限性：宽度剪枝破坏标准架构或需要定制推理代码，深度剪枝移除整个层导致精度骤降。

Method: 联合剪枝：(1)剪枝稀有词汇表缩小嵌入/解嵌入层；(2)基于常见token加权的激活值剪枝FFN中间通道，使重要性评估与剪枝后的token分布对齐。

Result: 在Qwen、LLaMA和Gemma系列模型(0.5B-70B)上实验显示，在相似或更高剪枝比例下达到最先进的下游任务性能，显著减少了参数量、GPU内存和端到端延迟。

Conclusion: COMPACT结合了深度和宽度剪枝的优点：部署友好(保持标准架构)、规模适应性(词汇表与FFN剪枝权衡)、无需训练的竞争性剪枝时间，以及强大的内存节省和吞吐量提升。

Abstract: Making LLMs more efficient in memory, latency, and serving cost is crucial
for edge deployment, interactive applications, and sustainable inference at
scale. Pruning is a key technique toward this goal. However, prior pruning
methods are limited: width pruning often breaks the standard transformer layout
or requires custom inference code, while depth pruning removes entire layers
and can cause abrupt accuracy drops. In this work, we propose COMPACT, which
jointly (i) prunes rare vocabulary to shrink embedding/unembedding and (ii)
prunes FFN intermediate channels using common-token-weighted activations,
aligning importance with the post-pruning token distribution. COMPACT enjoys
merits of both depth and width pruning, such as: deployment-friendliness (keeps
a standard transformer architecture), scale-adaptivity (trade off vocab vs. FFN
pruning), training-free operation with competitive pruning time, and strong
memory savings alongside throughput gains. Experiments across Qwen, LLaMA, and
Gemma families (0.5B-70B) show state-of-the-art downstream task performance at
similar or higher pruning ratios, with substantial reductions in parameters,
GPU memory, and end-to-end latency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了EPT指标，一个专门评估大语言模型在波斯文化背景下可信过程度的文化基础性指标，测试了8个领先模型在真实性、安全性、公平性、稳健性、隐私性和伦理对齐等六个维度的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在各种语言任务上表现出艰强能力，但确保其可信过程度仍是严峻挑战。可靠性不仅关乎准确性，还关乎维护伦理、文化和社会价值观。需要给合训练数据和基于文化的评估标准来发展负责任的AI系统。

Method: 研究开发了EPT（波斯文可信过程度评估）指标，一个专门为波斯文化设计的文化基础性指标。编译了标签数据集，并使用自动化的LLM基于评估和人工评估方法，对ChatGPT、Claude、DeepSeek、Gemini、Grok、LLaMA、Mistral和Qwen等8个领先模型进行了评测。

Result: 结果显示在安全性维度存在显著的缺陷，呈现出对模型行为这一关键方面进行重点关注的紧迫需求。研究还揭示了这些模型与波斯伦理-文化价值观对齐的情况，并指出了在推进可信过和文化负责任AI方面的关键空白和机遇。

Conclusion: 研究强调了为不同文化背景开发文化敏感性评估指标的重要性。EPT指标为评估LLM在波斯文化环境下的可信过程度提供了一个全面的框架，并发现现有模型在安全性方面存在显著缺陷。这项工作为发展更可信过和文化负责任的AI系统指明了方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on extensive datasets using advanced
deep learning architectures, have demonstrated remarkable performance across a
wide range of language tasks, becoming a cornerstone of modern AI technologies.
However, ensuring their trustworthiness remains a critical challenge, as
reliability is essential not only for accurate performance but also for
upholding ethical, cultural, and social values. Careful alignment of training
data and culturally grounded evaluation criteria are vital for developing
responsible AI systems. In this study, we introduce the EPT (Evaluation of
Persian Trustworthiness) metric, a culturally informed benchmark specifically
designed to assess the trustworthiness of LLMs across six key aspects:
truthfulness, safety, fairness, robustness, privacy, and ethical alignment. We
curated a labeled dataset and evaluated the performance of several leading
models - including ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, LLaMA, Mistral, and
Qwen - using both automated LLM-based and human assessments. Our results reveal
significant deficiencies in the safety dimension, underscoring the urgent need
for focused attention on this critical aspect of model behavior. Furthermore,
our findings offer valuable insights into the alignment of these models with
Persian ethical-cultural values and highlight critical gaps and opportunities
for advancing trustworthy and culturally responsible AI. The dataset is

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出AggLM方法，通过强化学习训练聚合器模型来整合多个候选解决方案，相比简单投票或奖励模型排序能更有效地提升大语言模型的推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前通过生成多个独立解决方案并选择或聚合的方法主要依赖简单多数投票或奖励模型排序，这些方法可能只能带来有限的性能提升，需要更智能的聚合策略。

Method: 使用强化学习训练聚合器模型，让模型学会审查、协调和综合多个候选解决方案来生成最终正确答案。关键是通过平衡简单和困难训练样本来学习恢复少数但正确的答案以及容易的多数正确答案。

Result: AggLM方法在多个基准测试中优于基于规则和奖励模型的基线方法，能够有效泛化到不同模型的解决方案，包括比训练数据中更强的模型，同时比多数投票方法需要更少的token。

Conclusion: 将聚合作为显式推理技能进行学习是有效的，通过精心设计的强化学习训练，聚合器模型能够更好地整合多个解决方案，提高最终答案的准确性。

Abstract: Scaling up test-time compute, by generating multiple independent solutions
and selecting or aggregating among them, has become a central paradigm for
improving large language models (LLMs) on challenging reasoning tasks. While
most prior work relies on simple majority voting or reward model ranking to
aggregate solutions, these approaches may only yield limited benefits. In this
work, we propose to learn aggregation as an explicit reasoning skill: given a
set of candidate solutions, we train an aggregator model to review, reconcile,
and synthesize a final, correct answer using reinforcement learning from
verifiable rewards. A key ingredient is careful balancing of easy and hard
training examples, allowing the model to learn both to recover
minority-but-correct answers as well as easy majority-correct answers.
Empirically, we find our method, AggLM, outperforms both strong rule-based and
reward-model baselines, across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, it generalizes
effectively to solutions from differing models, including stronger ones than
contained in the training data, all while requiring substantially fewer tokens
than majority voting with larger numbers of solutions.

Motivation: 参与CheckThat! Task 2英语任务，旨在从社交媒体段落中识别和提取值得进行事实核查的声明，提升自动事实核查系统的效率。

Method: 采用多种提示和上下文学习方法，包括少样本提示和不同LLM家族的微调，特别关注FLAN-T5模型的微调效果。

Result: 微调FLAN-T5模型获得了最佳的METEOR分数，但发现其他方法虽然METEOR分数较低，有时却能提取出更高质量的声明。

Conclusion: 虽然自动评估指标（如METEOR）很重要，但声明质量有时与这些指标不完全一致，需要综合考虑评估方法和声明质量。

Abstract: We participate in CheckThat! Task 2 English and explore various methods of
prompting and in-context learning, including few-shot prompting and fine-tuning
with different LLM families, with the goal of extracting check-worthy claims
from social media passages. Our best METEOR score is achieved by fine-tuning a
FLAN-T5 model. However, we observe that higher-quality claims can sometimes be
extracted using other methods, even when their METEOR scores are lower.

TL;DR: mmBERT是一个编码器语言模型，在1800多种语言的3T多语言文本上预训练，通过逆掩码比率调度和逆温度采样等新技术，在分类和检索任务上显著优于前代模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 编码器语言模型在多语言研究方面缺乏最新进展，特别是在多语言模型领域需要新的突破

Method: 使用3T多语言文本预训练，引入逆掩码比率调度和逆温度采样技术，在衰减阶段添加1700多种低资源语言数据

Result: 在分类和检索任务上显著优于前代模型，在低资源语言上表现优异，性能与OpenAI o3和Google Gemini 2.5 Pro相当

Conclusion: 通过创新的训练策略和数据调度方法，mmBERT证明了编码器模型在多语言任务中的强大潜力，特别是在低资源语言处理方面

Abstract: Encoder-only languages models are frequently used for a variety of standard
machine learning tasks, including classification and retrieval. However, there
has been a lack of recent research for encoder models, especially with respect
to multilingual models. We introduce mmBERT, an encoder-only language model
pretrained on 3T tokens of multilingual text in over 1800 languages. To build
mmBERT we introduce several novel elements, including an inverse mask ratio
schedule and an inverse temperature sampling ratio. We add over 1700
low-resource languages to the data mix only during the decay phase, showing
that it boosts performance dramatically and maximizes the gains from the
relatively small amount of training data. Despite only including these
low-resource languages in the short decay phase we achieve similar
classification performance to models like OpenAI's o3 and Google's Gemini 2.5
Pro. Overall, we show that mmBERT significantly outperforms the previous
generation of models on classification and retrieval tasks -- on both high and
low-resource languages.

### [65] [Proof-Carrying Numbers (PCN): A Protocol for Trustworthy Numeric Answers from LLMs via Claim Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06902)
*Aivin V. Solatorio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proof-Carrying Numbers (PCN) 是一种展示层协议，通过机械验证来强制保证大语言模型生成数字的准确性，将验证放在渲染器而非模型中，确保只有经过验证的数字才被标记为已验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型作为随机系统可能生成与可用数据不符的数字（数值幻觉问题），现有保护措施（检索增强生成、引用、不确定性估计）虽然提高了透明度但无法保证保真度，仍可能显示伪造或错误引用的数值。

Method: PCN协议将数字范围作为与结构化声明绑定的声明绑定令牌发出，验证器根据声明的策略（如精确相等、舍入、别名或带限定符的容差）检查每个令牌。验证在渲染器中进行，只有经过声明检查的数字才被标记为已验证。

Result: PCN被形式化并证明了其正确性、在诚实令牌下的完整性、故障关闭行为以及在策略细化下的单调性。PCN轻量级且模型无关，可无缝集成到现有应用中，并可扩展加密承诺。

Conclusion: 通过在显示前强制执行验证作为必要步骤，PCN为数值敏感环境建立了一个简单契约：信任只能通过证明获得，而缺少标记则传达不确定性，有效防止欺骗并保证故障关闭行为。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as stochastic systems may generate numbers that
deviate from available data, a failure known as \emph{numeric hallucination}.
Existing safeguards -- retrieval-augmented generation, citations, and
uncertainty estimation -- improve transparency but cannot guarantee fidelity:
fabricated or misquoted values may still be displayed as if correct. We propose
\textbf{Proof-Carrying Numbers (PCN)}, a presentation-layer protocol that
enforces numeric fidelity through mechanical verification. Under PCN, numeric
spans are emitted as \emph{claim-bound tokens} tied to structured claims, and a
verifier checks each token under a declared policy (e.g., exact equality,
rounding, aliases, or tolerance with qualifiers). Crucially, PCN places
verification in the \emph{renderer}, not the model: only claim-checked numbers
are marked as verified, and all others default to unverified. This separation
prevents spoofing and guarantees fail-closed behavior. We formalize PCN and
prove soundness, completeness under honest tokens, fail-closed behavior, and
monotonicity under policy refinement. PCN is lightweight and model-agnostic,
integrates seamlessly into existing applications, and can be extended with
cryptographic commitments. By enforcing verification as a mandatory step before
display, PCN establishes a simple contract for numerically sensitive settings:
\emph{trust is earned only by proof}, while the absence of a mark communicates
uncertainty.

*Liang Chen,Xueting Han,Li Shen,Jing Bai,Kam-Fai Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于双层优化的新方法，将监督微调(SFT)和强化学习(RL)联合训练，通过让SFT元学习如何指导RL优化过程，实现更好的协同效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的两阶段方法（先SFT后RL）限制了两种训练范式的交互，影响了整体效果。RL虽然能激励大语言模型的推理能力，但由于试错性质导致效率低下。

Method: 使用双层优化框架：下层执行RL更新同时接收SFT监督，上层显式最大化协同增益（联合训练相比单独RL的性能优势）。通过将SFT目标条件化在最优RL策略上，使SFT能够元学习指导RL优化。

Result: 在五个推理基准测试上的实证评估表明，该方法始终优于基线方法，并在效果和效率之间实现了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: 提出的双层优化方法通过促进SFT和RL之间的更好协作，显著提高了推理模型的学习效率和性能表现。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective in incentivizing the
reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), but suffers from severe
efficiency challenges due to its trial-and-error nature. While the common
practice employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a warm-up stage for RL, this
decoupled two-stage approach limits interaction between SFT and RL, thereby
constraining overall effectiveness. This study introduces a novel method for
learning reasoning models that employs bilevel optimization to facilitate
better cooperation between these training paradigms. By conditioning the SFT
objective on the optimal RL policy, our approach enables SFT to meta-learn how
to guide RL's optimization process. During training, the lower level performs
RL updates while simultaneously receiving SFT supervision, and the upper level
explicitly maximizes the cooperative gain-the performance advantage of joint
SFT-RL training over RL alone. Empirical evaluations on five reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines and
achieves a better balance between effectiveness and efficiency.

Motivation: 现有的扩散语言模型在推理任务上仍有提升空间，需要一种能够整合偏好推理轨迹的后训练框架来提升模型性能。

Method: 提出TraceRL框架，使用扩散基础的价值模型增强训练稳定性，支持课程学习，并可应用于不同架构的扩散语言模型。

Result: TraDo-4B-Instruct在数学推理任务上超越7B规模的自回归模型；TraDo-8B-Instruct在数学推理基准上相对Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct提升6.1%，相对Llama3.1-8B-Instruct提升51.3%；首个长链思维扩散模型在MATH500上相对Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct提升18.1%。

Conclusion: TraceRL框架有效提升了扩散语言模型的推理能力，推出的TraDo系列模型在多个基准测试中达到state-of-the-art性能，并开源了完整的训练和推理框架。

Abstract: We propose TraceRL, a trajectory-aware reinforcement learning framework for
diffusion language models (DLMs) that incorporates preferred inference
trajectory into post-training, and is applicable across different
architectures. Equipped with a diffusion-based value model that enhances
training stability, we demonstrate improved reasoning performance on complex
math and coding tasks. Besides, it can also be applied to adapt block-specific
models to larger blocks, which improves sampling flexibility. Employing
TraceRL, we derive a series of state-of-the-art diffusion language models,
namely TraDo. Although smaller than 7B-scale AR models, TraDo-4B-Instruct still
consistently outperforms them across complex math reasoning tasks.
TraDo-8B-Instruct achieves relative accuracy improvements of 6.1% over
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and 51.3% over Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on mathematical
reasoning benchmarks. Through curriculum learning, we also derive the first
long-CoT DLM, outperforming Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on MATH500 with an 18.1%
relative accuracy gain. To facilitate reproducible research and practical
applications, we release a comprehensive open-source framework for building,
training, and deploying diffusion LLMs across diverse architectures. The
framework integrates accelerated KV-cache techniques and inference engines for
both inference and reinforcement learning, and includes implementations of
various supervised fine-tuning and RL methods for mathematics, coding, and
general tasks. Code and Models: https://github.com/Gen-Verse/dLLM-RL

Method: 使用Wavelength游戏框架评估语言模型，测试语言理解和语言生成能力，比较直接提示、思维链提示和理性语言行为(RSA)方法的效果

Result: 现有最先进的大型语言模型在语言理解上表现接近人类准确度，与人类判断呈高相关性；在语言生成中，思维链提示比直接提示更好，RSA方法能显著提升性能

Conclusion: 研究识别了语言模型在语用理解方面的优势与限制，并证明了RSA方法在改善语用理解能力方面的潜力，为理解概念表征、语言理解和社会理解提供了新方向

Abstract: Language use is shaped by pragmatics -- i.e., reasoning about communicative
goals and norms in context. As language models (LMs) are increasingly used as
conversational agents, it becomes ever more important to understand their
pragmatic reasoning abilities. We propose an evaluation framework derived from
Wavelength, a popular communication game where a speaker and a listener
communicate about a broad range of concepts in a granular manner. We study a
range of LMs on both language comprehension and language production using
direct and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, and further explore a Rational
Speech Act (RSA) approach to incorporating Bayesian pragmatic reasoning into LM
inference. We find that state-of-the-art LMs, but not smaller ones, achieve
strong performance on language comprehension, obtaining similar-to-human
accuracy and exhibiting high correlations with human judgments even without CoT
prompting or RSA. On language production, CoT can outperform direct prompting,
and using RSA provides significant improvements over both approaches. Our study
helps identify the strengths and limitations in LMs' pragmatic reasoning
abilities and demonstrates the potential for improving them with RSA, opening
up future avenues for understanding conceptual representation, language
understanding, and social reasoning in LMs and humans.

TL;DR: 提出Label Smoothing++方法，通过为非目标类别分配非零概率并考虑类别间关系，改进传统标签平滑技术，缓解过拟合和过度自信问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标签平滑虽然能提高泛化能力，但为所有非目标类别分配相同重要性，破坏了类别间的关系结构。

Method: 使用固定目标类别标签，同时让网络学习非目标类别的标签，保持非零概率并考虑类别间关系。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效缓解过度自信预测，同时促进类别间关系和泛化能力。

Conclusion: Label Smoothing++通过更好地建模类别间关系，在保持标签平滑优势的同时解决了其局限性。

Abstract: Training neural networks with one-hot target labels often results in
overconfidence and overfitting. Label smoothing addresses this issue by
perturbing the one-hot target labels by adding a uniform probability vector to
create a regularized label. Although label smoothing improves the network's
generalization ability, it assigns equal importance to all the non-target
classes, which destroys the inter-class relationships. In this paper, we
propose a novel label regularization training strategy called Label
Smoothing++, which assigns non-zero probabilities to non-target classes and
accounts for their inter-class relationships. Our approach uses a fixed label
for the target class while enabling the network to learn the labels associated
with non-target classes. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we
demonstrate how Label Smoothing++ mitigates overconfident predictions while
promoting inter-class relationships and generalization capabilities.

Motivation: 解决目标检测中大规模标注数据集获取困难、传统主动学习缺乏透明度且可能忽略重要样本的问题，通过人机协作提升标注效率。

Method: 开发VILOD工具，集成t-SNE特征投影、不确定性热图和模型状态可视化，支持用户探索数据、解释模型状态并实施多样本选择策略。

Conclusion: VILOD为目标检测的人机协作标注工作流提供了更透明、可管理且可能更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The advancement of Object Detection (OD) using Deep Learning (DL) is often
hindered by the significant challenge of acquiring large, accurately labeled
datasets, a process that is time-consuming and expensive. While techniques like
Active Learning (AL) can reduce annotation effort by intelligently querying
informative samples, they often lack transparency, limit the strategic insight
of human experts, and may overlook informative samples not aligned with an
employed query strategy. To mitigate these issues, Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
approaches integrating human intelligence and intuition throughout the machine
learning life-cycle have gained traction. Leveraging Visual Analytics (VA),
effective interfaces can be created to facilitate this human-AI collaboration.
This thesis explores the intersection of these fields by developing and
investigating "VILOD: A Visual Interactive Labeling tool for Object Detection".
VILOD utilizes components such as a t-SNE projection of image features,
together with uncertainty heatmaps and model state views. Enabling users to
explore data, interpret model states, AL suggestions, and implement diverse
sample selection strategies within an iterative HITL workflow for OD. An
empirical investigation using comparative use cases demonstrated how VILOD,
through its interactive visualizations, facilitates the implementation of
distinct labeling strategies by making the model's state and dataset
characteristics more interpretable (RQ1). The study showed that different
visually-guided labeling strategies employed within VILOD result in competitive
OD performance trajectories compared to an automated uncertainty sampling AL
baseline (RQ2). This work contributes a novel tool and empirical insight into
making the HITL-AL workflow for OD annotation more transparent, manageable, and
potentially more effective.

Conclusion: 自适应知识萌蓬框架能够有效地动态调整硬软标签捐失之间的平衡，提升了知识萌蓬的效果和稳定性。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely used technique to transfer knowledge
from a large teacher network to a smaller student model. Traditional KD uses a
fixed balancing factor alpha as a hyperparameter to combine the hard-label
cross-entropy loss with the soft-label distillation loss. However, a static
alpha is suboptimal because the optimal trade-off between hard and soft
supervision can vary during training.
  In this work, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Distillation (AKD) framework.
First we try to make alpha as learnable parameter that can be automatically
learned and optimized during training. Then we introduce a formula to reflect
the gap between the student and the teacher to compute alpha dynamically,
guided by student-teacher discrepancies, and further introduce a Context-Aware
Module (CAM) using MLP + Attention to adaptively reweight class-wise teacher
outputs. Experiments on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-50 as teacher and ResNet-18 as
student demonstrate that our approach achieves superior accuracy compared to
fixed-weight KD baselines, and yields more stable convergence.

TL;DR: 本研究比较了三种边中心网络度量（FRC、ORC、EBC）在随机有线神经网络剪枝中的效果，发现计算效率更高的FRC能达到与ORC相当的剪枝性能，同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>

Motivation: 探索网络拓扑结构对深度学习性能的影响，寻找计算效率更高的网络剪枝方法，在保持模型性能的同时降低网络复杂度。

Method: 使用三种边中心网络度量（Forman-Ricci曲率、Ollivier-Ricci曲率、边介数中心性）对三种随机网络生成器（ER、WS、BA模型）生成的RWNN进行选择性剪枝，应用于COVID-19胸部X光图像分类任务。

Result: FRC基于剪枝能有效简化RWNN，在保持与ORC相当性能的同时提供显著的计算优势，压缩后的网络在模块化和全局效率之间达到平衡。

Conclusion: 计算效率更高的FRC可以作为ORC的有效替代方案用于神经网络剪枝，为网络压缩提供了新的实用工具。

Abstract: Randomly Wired Neural Networks (RWNNs) serve as a valuable testbed for
investigating the impact of network topology in deep learning by capturing how
different connectivity patterns impact both learning efficiency and model
performance. At the same time, they provide a natural framework for exploring
edge-centric network measures as tools for pruning and optimization. In this
study, we investigate three edge-centric network measures: Forman-Ricci
curvature (FRC), Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC), and edge betweenness
centrality (EBC), to compress RWNNs by selectively retaining important synapses
(or edges) while pruning the rest. As a baseline, RWNNs are trained for
COVID-19 chest x-ray image classification, aiming to reduce network complexity
while preserving performance in terms of accuracy, specificity, and
sensitivity. We extend prior work on pruning RWNN using ORC by incorporating
two additional edge-centric measures, FRC and EBC, across three network
generators: Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) model, Watts-Strogatz (WS) model, and
Barab\'{a}si-Albert (BA) model. We provide a comparative analysis of the
pruning performance of the three measures in terms of compression ratio and
theoretical speedup. A central focus of our study is to evaluate whether FRC,
which is computationally more efficient than ORC, can achieve comparable
pruning effectiveness. Along with performance evaluation, we further
investigate the structural properties of the pruned networks through modularity
and global efficiency, offering insights into the trade-off between modular
segregation and network efficiency in compressed RWNNs. Our results provide
initial evidence that FRC-based pruning can effectively simplify RWNNs,
offering significant computational advantages while maintaining performance
comparable to ORC.

synthetic scores and pretrained models. We publicly release all code, data, and

Motivation: 现实部署中目标识别模型面临域偏移导致准确率严重下降的问题，包括图像统计变化、姿态视角变化、部分遮挡和类别混淆等挑战

Method: 构建合成数据集生成管道产生带4线索标注的图像，对Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct进行参数高效监督调优，推理时采用两阶段重新思考机制

Result: 在隔离单个域偏移的鲁棒性基准测试中，RT-VLM始终超越强基线模型

Conclusion: 结构化多模态证据与显式自我批判循环的结合是实现可靠和可迁移视觉理解的有前景途径

Abstract: Real world deployments often expose modern object recognition models to
domain shifts that precipitate a severe drop in accuracy. Such shifts encompass
(i) variations in low level image statistics, (ii) changes in object pose and
viewpoint, (iii) partial occlusion, and (iv) visual confusion across adjacent
classes. To mitigate this degradation, we introduce the Re-Thinking Vision
Language Model (RT-VLM) framework. The foundation of this framework is a unique
synthetic dataset generation pipeline that produces images annotated with
"4-Clues": precise bounding boxes, class names, detailed object-level captions,
and a comprehensive context-level caption for the entire scene. We then perform
parameter efficient supervised tuning of Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct on this
resource. At inference time, a two stage Re-Thinking scheme is executed: the
model first emits its own four clues, then re examines these responses as
evidence and iteratively corrects them. Across robustness benchmarks that
isolate individual domain shifts, RT-VLM consistently surpasses strong
baselines. These findings indicate that the integration of structured
multimodal evidence with an explicit self critique loop constitutes a promising
route toward reliable and transferable visual understanding.

Abstract: Performance metrics in sports, such as shot speed and angle, provide crucial
feedback for athlete development. However, the technology to capture these
metrics has historically been expensive, complex, and largely inaccessible to
amateur and recreational players. This paper addresses this gap in the context
of badminton, one of the world's most popular sports, by introducing a novel,
cost-effective, and user-friendly system for measuring smash speed using
ubiquitous smartphone technology. Our approach leverages a custom-trained
YOLOv5 model for shuttlecock detection, combined with a Kalman filter for
robust trajectory tracking. By implementing a video-based kinematic speed
estimation method with spatiotemporal scaling, the system automatically
calculates the shuttlecock's velocity from a standard video recording. The
entire process is packaged into an intuitive mobile application, democratizing
access to high-level performance analytics and empowering players at all levels
to analyze and improve their game.

Motivation: 解决中文手写过程中语音、语义、字形等语言组件的调节机制不清、缺乏细粒度数据采集和批量处理工具的问题。

Method: 构建大规模手写数据库（42名语者手写1200字符），升级OpenHandWrite_Toolbox工具包，采用多重回归分析语言因素对不同层面手写的影响。

Result: 字形预测因子在字符、部首和笔画层面都影响手写准备和执行；语音因素在所有三个层面都影响执行；词汇效应呈现层级衰减特征，在字符层最明显，部首次之，笔画层最弱。

Conclusion: 部首和笔画层面的手写准备和执行与语言组件密切相关，该数据库和工具包为语言心理学和神经语言学研究提供了价值资源。

Abstract: Understanding what linguistic components (e.g., phonological, semantic, and
orthographic systems) modulate Chinese handwriting at the character, radical,
and stroke levels remains an important yet understudied topic. Additionally,
there is a lack of comprehensive tools for capturing and batch-processing
fine-grained handwriting data. To address these issues, we constructed a
large-scale handwriting database in which 42 Chinese speakers for each
handwriting 1200 characters in a handwriting-to-dictation task. Additionally,
we enhanced the existing handwriting package and provided comprehensive
documentation for the upgraded OpenHandWrite_Toolbox, which can easily modify
the experimental design, capture the stroke-level handwriting trajectory, and
batch-process handwriting measurements (e.g., latency, duration, and
pen-pressure). In analysing our large-scale database, multiple regression
results show that orthographic predictors impact handwriting preparation and
execution across character, radical, and stroke levels. Phonological factors
also influence execution at all three levels. Importantly, these lexical
effects demonstrate hierarchical attenuation - they were most pronounced at the
character level, followed by the radical, and were weakest at the stroke
levels. These findings demonstrate that handwriting preparation and execution
at the radical and stroke levels are closely intertwined with linguistic
components. This database and toolbox offer valuable resources for future
psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic research on the handwriting of characters
and sub-characters across different languages.

<details>

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注跌倒检测，但跌倒发生前的预测以及稳定状态与即将跌倒之间的瞬态状态分析尚未得到充分探索

Method: 使用混合模型（DGNN+LSTM），DGNN作为分类器区分三种步态状态（稳定、瞬态、跌倒），LSTM网络预测后续时间步的人类运动，实现早期跌倒检测

Conclusion: 解耦预测和分类任务相比统一处理能提升性能，该方法还能监测瞬态状态，为高级辅助系统提供有价值的洞察

Abstract: Detecting and preventing falls in humans is a critical component of assistive
robotic systems. While significant progress has been made in detecting falls,
the prediction of falls before they happen, and analysis of the transient state
between stability and an impending fall remain unexplored. In this paper, we
propose a anticipatory fall detection method that utilizes a hybrid model
combining Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNN) with Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks that decoupled the motion prediction and gait classification
tasks to anticipate falls with high accuracy. Our approach employs real-time
skeletal features extracted from video sequences as input for the proposed
model. The DGNN acts as a classifier, distinguishing between three gait states:
stable, transient, and fall. The LSTM-based network then predicts human
movement in subsequent time steps, enabling early detection of falls. The
proposed model was trained and validated using the OUMVLP-Pose and URFD
datasets, demonstrating superior performance in terms of prediction error and
recognition accuracy compared to models relying solely on DGNN and models from
literature. The results indicate that decoupling prediction and classification
improves performance compared to addressing the unified problem using only the
DGNN. Furthermore, our method allows for the monitoring of the transient state,
offering valuable insights that could enhance the functionality of advanced
assistance systems.

Abstract: Segmentation of brain tumors from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains a
pivotal challenge in medical image analysis due to the heterogeneous nature of
tumor morphology and intensity distributions. Accurate delineation of tumor
boundaries is critical for clinical decision-making, radiotherapy planning, and
longitudinal disease monitoring. In this study, we perform a comprehensive
comparative analysis of two major clustering paradigms applied in MRI tumor
segmentation: hard clustering, exemplified by the K-Means algorithm, and soft
clustering, represented by Fuzzy C-Means (FCM). While K-Means assigns each
pixel strictly to a single cluster, FCM introduces partial memberships, meaning
each pixel can belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of association.
Experimental validation was performed using the BraTS2020 dataset,
incorporating pre-processing through Gaussian filtering and Contrast Limited
Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). Evaluation metrics included the Dice
Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and processing time, which collectively
demonstrated that K-Means achieved superior speed with an average runtime of
0.3s per image, whereas FCM attained higher segmentation accuracy with an
average DSC of 0.67 compared to 0.43 for K-Means, albeit at a higher
computational cost (1.3s per image). These results highlight the inherent
trade-off between computational efficiency and boundary precision.

Abstract: Accurate classification of pests and diseases plays a vital role in precision
agriculture, enabling efficient identification, targeted interventions, and
preventing their further spread. However, current methods primarily focus on
binary classification, which limits their practical applications, especially in
scenarios where accurately identifying the specific type of disease or pest is
essential. We propose a robust deep learning based model for multi-class
classification of onion crop diseases and pests. We enhance a pre-trained
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model by integrating attention based modules
and employing comprehensive data augmentation pipeline to mitigate class
imbalance. We propose a model which gives 96.90% overall accuracy and 0.96 F1
score on real-world field image dataset. This model gives better results than
other approaches using the same datasets.

Conclusion: DVRF成功连接了基于分数的扩散优化和基于速度的整流流优化，为FlowEdit方法提供了理论解释，是高效的文本到图像编辑解决方案。

Abstract: We propose Delta Velocity Rectified Flow (DVRF), a novel inversion-free,
path-aware editing framework within rectified flow models for text-to-image
editing. DVRF is a distillation-based method that explicitly models the
discrepancy between the source and target velocity fields in order to mitigate
over-smoothing artifacts rampant in prior distillation sampling approaches. We
further introduce a time-dependent shift term to push noisy latents closer to
the target trajectory, enhancing the alignment with the target distribution. We
theoretically demonstrate that when this shift is disabled, DVRF reduces to
Delta Denoising Score, thereby bridging score-based diffusion optimization and
velocity-based rectified-flow optimization. Moreover, when the shift term
follows a linear schedule under rectified-flow dynamics, DVRF generalizes the
Inversion-free method FlowEdit and provides a principled theoretical
interpretation for it. Experimental results indicate that DVRF achieves
superior editing quality, fidelity, and controllability while requiring no
architectural modifications, making it efficient and broadly applicable to
text-to-image editing tasks. Code is available at

Abstract: Deep learning has become a powerful tool for medical image analysis; however,
conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) often fail to capture the
fine-grained and complex features critical for accurate diagnosis. To address
this limitation, we systematically integrate attention mechanisms into five
widely adopted CNN architectures, namely, VGG16, ResNet18, InceptionV3,
DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB5, to enhance their ability to focus on salient
regions and improve discriminative performance. Specifically, each baseline
model is augmented with either a Squeeze and Excitation block or a hybrid
Convolutional Block Attention Module, allowing adaptive recalibration of
channel and spatial feature representations. The proposed models are evaluated
on two distinct medical imaging datasets, a brain tumor MRI dataset comprising
multiple tumor subtypes, and a Products of Conception histopathological dataset
containing four tissue categories. Experimental results demonstrate that
attention augmented CNNs consistently outperform baseline architectures across
all metrics. In particular, EfficientNetB5 with hybrid attention achieves the
highest overall performance, delivering substantial gains on both datasets.
Beyond improved classification accuracy, attention mechanisms enhance feature
localization, leading to better generalization across heterogeneous imaging
modalities. This work contributes a systematic comparative framework for
embedding attention modules in diverse CNN architectures and rigorously
assesses their impact across multiple medical imaging tasks. The findings
provide practical insights for the development of robust, interpretable, and
clinically applicable deep learning based decision support systems.

Abstract: Instance segmentation is essential for numerous computer vision applications,
including robotics, human-computer interaction, and autonomous driving.
Currently, popular models bring impressive performance in instance segmentation
by training with a large number of human annotations, which are costly to
collect. For this reason, we present a new framework that efficiently and
effectively segments objects without the need for human annotations. Firstly, a
MultiCut algorithm is applied to self-supervised features for coarse mask
segmentation. Then, a mask filter is employed to obtain high-quality coarse
masks. To train the segmentation network, we compute a novel superpixel-guided
mask loss, comprising hard loss and soft loss, with high-quality coarse masks
and superpixels segmented from low-level image features. Lastly, a
self-training process with a new adaptive loss is proposed to improve the
quality of predicted masks. We conduct experiments on public datasets in
instance segmentation and object detection to demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework. The results show that the proposed framework
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Cell biomechanics involve a great number of complex phenomena that are
fundamental to the evolution of life itself and other associated processes,
ranging from the very early stages of embryo-genesis to the maintenance of
damaged structures or the growth of tumors. Given the importance of such
phenomena, increasing research has been dedicated to their understanding, but
the many interactions between them and their influence on the decisions of
cells as a collective network or cluster remain unclear. We present a new
approach that combines Structure Preserving Neural Networks, which study cell
movements as a purely mechanical system, with other Machine Learning tools
(Artificial Neural Networks), which allow taking into consideration
environmental factors that can be directly deduced from an experiment with
Computer Vision techniques. This new model, tested on simulated and real cell
migration cases, predicts complete cell trajectories following a roll-out
policy with a high level of accuracy. This work also includes a mitosis event
prediction model based on Neural Networks architectures which makes use of the
same observed features.

Conclusion: 频率感知优化对于实现真实图像表示至关重要，在内容创作、神经渲染和医学成像等领域具有广泛的应用意义。

Abstract: Latent generative models have shown remarkable progress in high-fidelity
image synthesis, typically using a two-stage training process that involves
compressing images into latent embeddings via learned tokenizers in the first
stage. The quality of generation strongly depends on how expressive and
well-optimized these latent embeddings are. While various methods have been
proposed to learn effective latent representations, the reconstructed images
often lack realism, particularly in textured regions with sharp transitions,
due to loss of fine details governed by high frequencies. We conduct a detailed
frequency decomposition of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) latent tokenizers
and show that conventional objectives inherently prioritize low-frequency
reconstruction, often at the expense of high-frequency fidelity. Our analysis
reveals these latent tokenizers exhibit a bias toward low-frequency
information, when jointly optimized, leading to over-smoothed outputs and
visual artifacts that diminish perceptual quality. To address this, we propose
a wavelet-based, frequency-aware variational autoencoder (FA-VAE) framework
that explicitly decouples the optimization of low- and high-frequency
components. This decoupling enables improved reconstruction of fine textures
while preserving global structure. Our approach bridges the fidelity gap in
current latent tokenizers and emphasizes the importance of frequency-aware
optimization for realistic image representation, with broader implications for
applications in content creation, neural rendering, and medical imaging.

Abstract: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have achieved state of the art performance
across various computer vision tasks, however their practical deployment is
limited by computational and memory overhead. This paper introduces
Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning, a novel single shot filter pruning
framework that focuses on evaluating the stability and redundancy of filter
importance scores across multiple criteria. Differential Sensitivity Fusion
Pruning computes a differential sensitivity score for each filter by fusing the
discrepancies among gradient based sensitivity, first order Taylor expansion,
and KL divergence of activation distributions. An exponential scaling mechanism
is applied to emphasize filters with inconsistent importance across metrics,
identifying candidates that are structurally unstable or less critical to the
model performance. Unlike iterative or reinforcement learning based pruning
strategies, Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning is efficient and
deterministic, requiring only a single forward-backward pass for scoring and
pruning. Extensive experiments across varying pruning rates between 50 to 70
percent demonstrate that Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning significantly
reduces model complexity, achieving over 80 percent Floating point Operations
Per Seconds reduction while maintaining high accuracy. For instance, at 70
percent pruning, our approach retains up to 98.23 percent of baseline accuracy,
surpassing traditional heuristics in both compression and generalization. The
proposed method presents an effective solution for scalable and adaptive Deep
Convolutional Neural Networks compression, paving the way for efficient
deployment on edge and mobile platforms.

*Andrzej D. Dobrzycki,Ana M. Bernardos,José R. Casar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究分析了YOLOv8和YOLOv10在不同层冻结策略下的性能表现，发现最优冻结策略取决于数据集特性，而非通用方案。冻结主干网络可保留通用特征，而浅层冻结更适合处理类别不平衡问题，可减少28% GPU内存消耗并在某些情况下超越全微调性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限环境（如无人机）中部署YOLO架构需要高效的迁移学习。虽然层冻结是常用技术，但不同冻结配置对现代YOLOv8和YOLOv10架构的具体影响尚未探索，特别是在冻结深度、数据集特性和训练动态之间的相互作用方面。

Method: 系统研究YOLOv8和YOLOv10变体的多种冻结配置，使用四个关键基础设施监控数据集。方法集成了梯度行为分析（L2范数）和视觉解释（Grad-CAM）来深入理解不同冻结策略下的训练动态。

Result: 结果显示没有通用的最优冻结策略，而是取决于数据特性。冻结主干网络可有效保留通用特征，浅层冻结更适合处理极端类别不平衡。这些配置相比全微调减少高达28%的GPU内存消耗，在某些情况下mAP@50分数甚至超过全微调。梯度分析证实了这些发现，显示适度冻结模型具有不同的收敛模式。

Conclusion: 本研究提供了经验发现和实用指南，用于在有限资源场景中选择冻结策略，为物体检测提供了基于证据的平衡迁移学习方法。

Abstract: The You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture is crucial for real-time object
detection. However, deploying it in resource-constrained environments such as
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) requires efficient transfer learning. Although
layer freezing is a common technique, the specific impact of various freezing
configurations on contemporary YOLOv8 and YOLOv10 architectures remains
unexplored, particularly with regard to the interplay between freezing depth,
dataset characteristics, and training dynamics. This research addresses this
gap by presenting a detailed analysis of layer-freezing strategies. We
systematically investigate multiple freezing configurations across YOLOv8 and
YOLOv10 variants using four challenging datasets that represent critical
infrastructure monitoring. Our methodology integrates a gradient behavior
analysis (L2 norm) and visual explanations (Grad-CAM) to provide deeper
insights into training dynamics under different freezing strategies. Our
results reveal that there is no universal optimal freezing strategy but,
rather, one that depends on the properties of the data. For example, freezing
the backbone is effective for preserving general-purpose features, while a
shallower freeze is better suited to handling extreme class imbalance. These
configurations reduce graphics processing unit (GPU) memory consumption by up
to 28% compared to full fine-tuning and, in some cases, achieve mean average
precision (mAP@50) scores that surpass those of full fine-tuning. Gradient
analysis corroborates these findings, showing distinct convergence patterns for
moderately frozen models. Ultimately, this work provides empirical findings and
practical guidelines for selecting freezing strategies. It offers a practical,
evidence-based approach to balanced transfer learning for object detection in
scenarios with limited resources.

Conclusion: QUAN展示了在资源受限机器人系统中部署的潜力，适用于需要旋转感知感知的应用领域。

Abstract: This paper introduces Quaternion Approximate Networks (QUAN), a novel deep
learning framework that leverages quaternion algebra for rotation equivariant
image classification and object detection. Unlike conventional quaternion
neural networks attempting to operate entirely in the quaternion domain, QUAN
approximates quaternion convolution through Hamilton product decomposition
using real-valued operations. This approach preserves geometric properties
while enabling efficient implementation with custom CUDA kernels. We introduce
Independent Quaternion Batch Normalization (IQBN) for training stability and
extend quaternion operations to spatial attention mechanisms. QUAN is evaluated
on image classification (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet), object detection (COCO,
DOTA), and robotic perception tasks. In classification tasks, QUAN achieves
higher accuracy with fewer parameters and faster convergence compared to
existing convolution and quaternion-based models. For objection detection, QUAN
demonstrates improved parameter efficiency and rotation handling over standard
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while establishing the SOTA for quaternion
CNNs in this downstream task. These results highlight its potential for
deployment in resource-constrained robotic systems requiring rotation-aware
perception and application in other domains.

Abstract: Recently, distilling open-vocabulary language features from 2D images into 3D
Gaussians has attracted significant attention. Although existing methods
achieve impressive language-based interactions of 3D scenes, we observe two
fundamental issues: background Gaussians contributing negligibly to a rendered
pixel get the same feature as the dominant foreground ones, and multi-view
inconsistencies due to view-specific noise in language embeddings. We introduce
Visibility-Aware Language Aggregation (VALA), a lightweight yet effective
method that computes marginal contributions for each ray and applies a
visibility-aware gate to retain only visible Gaussians. Moreover, we propose a
streaming weighted geometric median in cosine space to merge noisy multi-view
features. Our method yields a robust, view-consistent language feature
embedding in a fast and memory-efficient manner. VALA improves open-vocabulary
localization and segmentation across reference datasets, consistently
surpassing existing works.

Motivation: 现有的表示学习方法主要针对动作识别任务，基于孤立的序列级表示，而动作分割需要利用多尺度表示和跨序列变化。

Method: 提出'Shuffle and Warp'数据增强策略，利用多样化的多动作排列。引入两个对比学习代理任务：跨排列对比(CPC)学习类内相似性，相对顺序推理(ROR)推理类间上下文。构建Dual-Surrogate Contrastive Learning网络。

Conclusion: 该框架通过创新的数据增强和双代理对比学习策略，有效提升了动作分割性能，消融研究验证了各组件的重要性。

Abstract: In this paper, a contrastive representation learning framework is proposed to
enhance human action segmentation via pre-training using trimmed (single
action) skeleton sequences. Unlike previous representation learning works that
are tailored for action recognition and that build upon isolated sequence-wise
representations, the proposed framework focuses on exploiting multi-scale
representations in conjunction with cross-sequence variations. More
specifically, it proposes a novel data augmentation strategy, 'Shuffle and
Warp', which exploits diverse multi-action permutations. The latter effectively
assists two surrogate tasks that are introduced in contrastive learning: Cross
Permutation Contrasting (CPC) and Relative Order Reasoning (ROR). In
optimization, CPC learns intra-class similarities by contrasting
representations of the same action class across different permutations, while
ROR reasons about inter-class contexts by predicting relative mapping between
two permutations. Together, these tasks enable a Dual-Surrogate Contrastive
Learning (DuoCLR) network to learn multi-scale feature representations
optimized for action segmentation. In experiments, DuoCLR is pre-trained on a
trimmed skeleton dataset and evaluated on an untrimmed dataset where it
demonstrates a significant boost over state-the-art comparatives in both
multi-class and multi-label action segmentation tasks. Lastly, ablation studies
are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of each component of the proposed
approach.

Conclusion: 通过稳健性导向的批利策略和解耦关注机制，RED网络能够有效处理事件流的不完整性，显著提升事件导向动态去模糊的性能。

Abstract: Event cameras provide sparse yet temporally high-temporal-resolution motion
information, demonstrating great potential for motion deblurring. Existing
methods focus on cross-modal interaction, overlooking the inherent
incompleteness of event streams, which arises from the trade-off between
sensitivity and noise introduced by the thresholding mechanism of Dynamic
Vision Sensors (DVS). Such degradation compromises the integrity of motion
priors and limits the effectiveness of event-guided deblurring. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a Robust Event-guided Deblurring (RED) network with
modality-specific disentangled representation. First, we introduce a
Robustness-Oriented Perturbation Strategy (RPS) that applies random masking to
events, which exposes RED to incomplete patterns and then foster robustness
against various unknown scenario conditions.Next, a disentangled OmniAttention
is presented to explicitly model intra-motion, inter-motion, and cross-modality
correlations from two inherently distinct but complementary sources: blurry
images and partially disrupted events. Building on these reliable features, two
interactive modules are designed to enhance motion-sensitive areas in blurry
images and inject semantic context into incomplete event representations.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate RED
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
robustness.

Abstract: Model quantization reduces neural network parameter precision to achieve
compression, but often compromises accuracy. Existing post-training
quantization (PTQ) methods employ iterative parameter updates to preserve
accuracy under high compression ratios, incurring significant computational
complexity and resource overhead, which limits applicability in
resource-constrained edge computing and real-time inference scenarios. This
paper proposes an efficient PTQ method guided by parameter sensitivity
analysis. The approach prioritizes quantization of high-sensitivity parameters,
leveraging unquantized low-sensitivity parameters to compensate for
quantization errors, thereby mitigating accuracy degradation. Furthermore, by
exploiting column-wise clustering of parameter sensitivity, the method
introduces a row-parallel quantization framework with a globally shared inverse
Hessian matrix update mechanism, reducing computational complexity by an order
of magnitude. Experimental results on ResNet-50 and YOLOv5s demonstrate a
20-200-fold quantization speedup over the Optimal Brain Quantization baseline,
with mean accuracy loss below 0.3%, confirming the method's efficacy in
balancing efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore a reconstruction and reenactment separated

input to generate controllable avatar. Specifically, we developed a large-scale
one-shot gaussian head generator built upon WebSSL and employed a two-stage
training approach that significantly enhances the capabilities of
generalization and high-frequency texture reconstruction. During inference, an
ultra-lightweight gaussian avatar driven by control signals enables high
frame-rate rendering, achieving 90 FPS at a resolution of 512x512. We further
demonstrate that the proposed framework follows the scaling law, whereby
increasing the parameter scale of the reconstruction module leads to improved
performance. Moreover, thanks to the separation design, driving efficiency
remains unaffected. Finally, extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
validate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

real-world scenarios. Specifically, these data sets fall short in four key
areas: unknown of advanced forgery techniques, variability of facial scenes,
richness of real data, and degradation of real-world propagation. To address
these challenges, we propose the Multi-dimensional Face Forgery Image
(\textbf{MFFI}) dataset, tailored for real-world scenarios. MFFI enhances
realism based on four strategic dimensions: 1) Wider Forgery Methods; 2) Varied
Facial Scenes; 3) Diversified Authentic Data; 4) Multi-level Degradation
Operations. MFFI integrates $50$ different forgery methods and contains $1024K$
image samples. Benchmark evaluations show that MFFI outperforms existing public
datasets in terms of scene complexity, cross-domain generalization capability,
and detection difficulty gradients. These results validate the technical
advance and practical utility of MFFI in simulating real-world conditions. The
dataset and additional details are publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoGraph：基于语言引导的时空图建模的视频摘要方法，通过构建对象和帧的图结构，利用语义关系进行关键帧选择，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频摘要方法主要关注帧间时序建模，但忽略了细粒度视觉实体（如对象）的语义关系。语言引导的视频摘要需要全面理解复杂视频的语义内容

Method: 提出递归时空图网络VideoGraph，将对象和帧分别作为空间图和时间图的节点，通过图边表示语义关系。引入语言查询来增强节点语义表示，采用递归策略优化图结构

Result: 在多个通用和查询聚焦视频摘要基准测试中，无论是监督还是无监督方式都达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: VideoGraph通过语言引导的时空图建模有效解决了视频摘要问题，证明了考虑对象语义关系和语言指导的重要性

Abstract: Video summarization aims to select keyframes that are visually diverse and
can represent the whole story of a given video. Previous approaches have
focused on global interlinkability between frames in a video by temporal
modeling. However, fine-grained visual entities, such as objects, are also
highly related to the main content of the video. Moreover, language-guided
video summarization, which has recently been studied, requires a comprehensive
linguistic understanding of complex real-world videos. To consider how all the
objects are semantically related to each other, this paper regards video
summarization as a language-guided spatiotemporal graph modeling problem. We
present recursive spatiotemporal graph networks, called VideoGraph, which
formulate the objects and frames as nodes of the spatial and temporal graphs,
respectively. The nodes in each graph are connected and aggregated with graph
edges, representing the semantic relationships between the nodes. To prevent
the edges from being configured with visual similarity, we incorporate language
queries derived from the video into the graph node representations, enabling
them to contain semantic knowledge. In addition, we adopt a recursive strategy
to refine initial graphs and correctly classify each frame node as a keyframe.
In our experiments, VideoGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance on several
benchmarks for generic and query-focused video summarization in both supervised
and unsupervised manners. The code is available at

TL;DR: 通过补丁级内核对齐(PaKA)方法实现密集表征学习，在多个密集视觉指标上达到最先进水平


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督表征学习方法主要关注全局表征，无法抓取局部语义和细粒度细节，而密集预测任务需要空间精确性和密集表征

Method: 提出基于预训练表征的自监督学习框架，通过Patch-level Kernel Alignment (PaKA)对齐教师和学生模型的密集特征分布，抓取统计依赖关系匹配结构关系，并研究适合密集表征学习的增强策略

Result: 在多个密集视觉指标上达到最先进水平

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效将现有语义知识转移到密集特征空间，提高密集表征学习的效果

Abstract: Dense representations are essential for vision tasks that require spatial
precision and fine-grained detail. While most self-supervised representation
learning methods focus on global representations that summarize the image as a
whole, such approaches often fall short in capturing the localized semantics
necessary for dense prediction tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose
a framework that builds on pretrained representations through additional
self-supervised learning, aiming to transfer existing semantic knowledge into
the dense feature space. Our method aligns the distributions of dense features
between a teacher and a student model. Specifically, we introduce Patch-level
Kernel Alignment (PaKA), a simple yet effective alignment objective that
captures statistical dependencies, thereby matching the structural
relationships of dense patches across the two models. In addition, we
investigate augmentation strategies specifically designed for dense
representation learning. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results across
a variety of dense vision benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecPrune-VLA是一种无需训练的双层剪枝方法，利用局部和全局信息进行智能token选择，在视觉-语言-动作模型上实现1.46-1.57倍加速，且成功率损失可忽略


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有剪枝方法仅使用当前动作的局部信息，忽略了先前动作的全局上下文，导致成功率下降超过20%且加速有限。观察到连续动作间存在高度相似性，需要同时利用局部和全局信息

Method: 提出SpecPrune-VLA方法：1)动作级静态剪枝：使用全局历史和局部上下文减少每个动作的视觉token；2)层级动态剪枝：基于层级重要性剪枝token；3)轻量级动作感知控制器：按速度将动作分类为粗/细粒度，调整剪枝强度

Result: 在LIBERO数据集上，SpecPrune-VLA在NVIDIA A800上实现1.46倍加速，在NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090上实现1.57倍加速，相比OpenVLA-OFT，成功率损失可忽略

Conclusion: 通过结合局部和全局信息进行智能token选择，SpecPrune-VLA能够在保持模型性能的同时显著加速视觉-语言-动作模型的推理过程

Abstract: Pruning accelerates compute-bound models by reducing computation. Recently
applied to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, existing methods prune tokens
using only local info from current action, ignoring global context from prior
actions, causing >20% success rate drop and limited speedup. We observe high
similarity across consecutive actions and propose leveraging both local
(current) and global (past) info for smarter token selection. We introduce
SpecPrune-VLA, a training-free method with two-level pruning and heuristic
control: (1) Static pruning at action level: uses global history and local
context to reduce visual tokens per action; (2) Dynamic pruning at layer level:
prunes tokens per layer based on layer-specific importance; (3) Lightweight
action-aware controller: classifies actions as coarse/fine-grained (by speed),
adjusting pruning aggressiveness since fine-grained actions are
pruning-sensitive. Experiments on LIBERO show SpecPrune-VLA achieves 1.46 times
speedup on NVIDIA A800 and 1.57 times on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 vs.
OpenVLA-OFT, with negligible success rate loss.

*Kien Nguyen,Anh Tran,Cuong Pham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Subspace Mapping (SuMa)方法，专门用于有效擦除文本到图像扩散模型中的窄概念（如版权角色、名人），同时保持图像质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念擦除方法无法同时实现鲁棒性和有效性，特别是对于窄概念（如版权角色、名人）的擦除存在挑战，这些概念与邻近非目标概念距离很近，需要更精细的操作

Method: SuMa方法首先推导表示要擦除概念的目标子空间，然后通过将其映射到最小化两个子空间之间距离的参考子空间来中和目标概念

Result: 在四个任务（子类擦除、名人擦除、艺术风格擦除、实例擦除）上的实验表明，SuMa在图像质量上可与注重有效性的方法相媲美，同时在完整性方面与目标方法相当

Conclusion: SuMa方法成功解决了窄概念擦除的挑战，实现了鲁棒性和有效性的平衡，为处理版权和法律问题提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-image diffusion models has raised concerns about
their potential misuse in generating harmful or unauthorized contents. To
address these issues, several Concept Erasure methods have been proposed.
However, most of them fail to achieve both robustness, i.e., the ability to
robustly remove the target concept., and effectiveness, i.e., maintaining image
quality. While few recent techniques successfully achieve these goals for NSFW
concepts, none could handle narrow concepts such as copyrighted characters or
celebrities. Erasing these narrow concepts is critical in addressing copyright
and legal concerns. However, erasing them is challenging due to their close
distances to non-target neighboring concepts, requiring finer-grained
manipulation. In this paper, we introduce Subspace Mapping (SuMa), a novel
method specifically designed to achieve both robustness and effectiveness in
easing these narrow concepts. SuMa first derives a target subspace representing
the concept to be erased and then neutralizes it by mapping it to a reference
subspace that minimizes the distance between the two. This mapping ensures the
target concept is robustly erased while preserving image quality. We conduct
extensive experiments with SuMa across four tasks: subclass erasure, celebrity
erasure, artistic style erasure, and instance erasure and compare the results
with current state-of-the-art methods. Our method achieves image quality
comparable to approaches focused on effectiveness, while also yielding results
that are on par with methods targeting completeness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航空遥感中的多光谱和RGB成像技术推动了精准农业的发展，但高光谱图像标签有限或无标签的情况下的分析具有挑战性，需要开发有效的自监督学习方法。

Method: 采用自监督学习技术，构建反映植被特性的神经网络嵌入空间，从航空高光谱图像中提取树木的表示特征。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用植被特性相关嵌入空间构建的树木表示，在下游机器学习任务中的性能优于直接使用高光谱植被特性作为树木表示的方法。

Conclusion: 自监督学习能够有效从无标签或标签有限的高光谱图像中学习有意义的植被特性表示，为精准农业中的树木分析提供了更好的特征提取方法。

Abstract: Aerial remote sensing using multispectral and RGB imagers has provided a
critical impetus to precision agriculture. Analysis of the hyperspectral images
with limited or no labels is challenging. This paper focuses on self-supervised
learning to create neural network embeddings reflecting vegetation properties
of trees from aerial hyperspectral images of crop fields. Experimental results
demonstrate that a constructed tree representation, using a vegetation
property-related embedding space, performs better in downstream machine
learning tasks compared to the direct use of hyperspectral vegetation
properties as tree representations.

Motivation: 因为基于非孜加拉岛数据集训练的车辆检测系统在孜加拉岛特有道路环境中识别本地车辆类型时表现差异，影响自动驾驶技术在发展中地区的应用。

Method: 使用移动手机摄像头采集高清图片，手动标注包29种孜加拉岛特有车辆类别，对六种YOLO模型变体进行性能评估。

Result: YOLOv11x获得最高mAP@0.5(63.7%)，但速度慢(45.8ms)；YOLOv8m和YOLOv11m在性能(62.5%和61.8% mAP@0.5)和速度(14-15ms)之间取得最佳平衡。稀缺车辆类别检测准确度极低。

Conclusion: 研究为开发适用于孜加拉岛道路环境的物体检测系统奠定了基础，解决了通用模型在发展中地区无法正确识别本地车辆类型的问题。

Abstract: Vehicle detection systems trained on Non-Bangladeshi datasets struggle to
accurately identify local vehicle types in Bangladesh's unique road
environments, creating critical gaps in autonomous driving technology for
developing regions. This study evaluates six YOLO model variants on a custom
dataset featuring 29 distinct vehicle classes, including region-specific
vehicles such as ``Desi Nosimon'', ``Leguna'', ``Battery Rickshaw'', and
``CNG''. The dataset comprises high-resolution images (1920x1080) captured
across various Bangladeshi roads using mobile phone cameras and manually
annotated using LabelImg with YOLO format bounding boxes. Performance
evaluation revealed YOLOv11x as the top performer, achieving 63.7\% mAP@0.5,
43.8\% mAP@0.5:0.95, 61.4\% recall, and 61.6\% F1-score, though requiring 45.8
milliseconds per image for inference. Medium variants (YOLOv8m, YOLOv11m)
struck an optimal balance, delivering robust detection performance with mAP@0.5
values of 62.5\% and 61.8\% respectively, while maintaining moderate inference
times around 14-15 milliseconds. The study identified significant detection
challenges for rare vehicle classes, with Construction Vehicles and Desi
Nosimons showing near-zero accuracy due to dataset imbalances and insufficient
training samples. Confusion matrices revealed frequent misclassifications
between visually similar vehicles, particularly Mini Trucks versus Mini Covered
Vans. This research provides a foundation for developing robust object
detection systems specifically adapted to Bangladesh traffic conditions,
addressing critical needs in autonomous vehicle technology advancement for
developing regions where conventional generic-trained models fail to perform
adequately.

TL;DR: EditIDv2是一个无需调优的解决方案，专门针对高复杂度叙事场景和长文本输入，通过改进ID特征集成模块和可编辑性注入机制，在少量数据润滑下实现深度多层级语义编辑和身份一致性保持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有角色编辑方法在简单提示下表现良好，但在面对包含多层语义、时间逻辑和复杂上下文关系的长文本叙事时，往往会出现编辑能力下降、语义理解偏差和身份一致性崩溃的问题。

Method: 通过PerceiverAttention的精细分解、引入ID损失和与扩散模型的联合动态训练，以及集成模块的离线融合策略，在少量数据润滑下实现深度多层级语义编辑。

Result: 在复杂叙事环境中实现了身份一致性保持，满足了长提示词和高质量图像生成的需求，在IBench评估中取得了优异结果。

Conclusion: EditIDv2成功解决了长文本叙事场景下的角色编辑挑战，通过创新的架构设计和训练策略，在保持身份一致性的同时实现了高质量的语义编辑。

Abstract: We propose EditIDv2, a tuning-free solution specifically designed for
high-complexity narrative scenes and long text inputs. Existing character
editing methods perform well under simple prompts, but often suffer from
degraded editing capabilities, semantic understanding biases, and identity
consistency breakdowns when faced with long text narratives containing multiple
semantic layers, temporal logic, and complex contextual relationships. In
EditID, we analyzed the impact of the ID integration module on editability. In
EditIDv2, we further explore and address the influence of the ID feature
integration module. The core of EditIDv2 is to discuss the issue of editability
injection under minimal data lubrication. Through a sophisticated decomposition
of PerceiverAttention, the introduction of ID loss and joint dynamic training
with the diffusion model, as well as an offline fusion strategy for the
integration module, we achieve deep, multi-level semantic editing while
maintaining identity consistency in complex narrative environments using only a
small amount of data lubrication. This meets the demands of long prompts and
high-quality image generation, and achieves excellent results in the IBench
evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语言模型的场景图预测方法OOTSM，通过两阶段LLM处理实现对象状态预测和关系生成，在短期和长期预测上均取得显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有场景图预测方法主要依赖视觉线索，难以有效整合常识知识，限制了长期预测的鲁棒性。需要显式利用常识知识来更好地理解场景中的对象和关系

Method: 提出Linguistic Scene Graph Anticipation (LSGA)任务，采用Object-Oriented Two-Staged Method (OOTSM)：第一阶段LLM预测对象出现和消失，第二阶段生成详细的人-物关系

Result: 在Action Genome基准测试中，短期mean-Recall(@10)提升3.4%，长期mean-Recall(@50)大幅提升21.9%，达到state-of-the-art性能

Conclusion: 纯文本的LSGA方法能有效利用常识知识进行场景图预测，OOTSM两阶段方法在短期和长期预测上都表现出色，为场景理解提供了新的语言模型应用方向

Abstract: A scene graph is a structured represention of objects and their relationships
in a scene. Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) involves predicting future scene
graphs from video clips, enabling applications as intelligent surveillance and
human-machine collaboration. Existing SGA approaches primarily leverage visual
cues, often struggling to integrate valuable commonsense knowledge, thereby
limiting long-term prediction robustness. To explicitly leverage such
commonsense knowledge, we propose a new approach to better understand the
objects, concepts, and relationships in a scene graph. Our approach decouples
the SGA task in two steps: first a scene graph capturing model is used to
convert a video clip into a sequence of scene graphs, then a pure text-based
model is used to predict scene graphs in future frames. Our focus in this work
is on the second step, and we call it Linguistic Scene Graph Anticipation
(LSGA) and believes it should have independent interest beyond the use in SGA
discussed here. For LSGA, we introduce an Object-Oriented Two-Staged Method
(OOTSM) where an Large Language Model (LLM) first forecasts object appearances
and disappearances before generating detailed human-object relations. We
conduct extensive experiments to evaluate OOTSM in two settings. For LSGA, we
evaluate our fine-tuned open-sourced LLMs against zero-shot APIs (i.e., GPT-4o,
GPT-4o-mini, and DeepSeek-V3) on a benchmark constructed from Action Genome
annotations. For SGA, we combine our OOTSM with STTran++ from, and our
experiments demonstrate effective state-of-the-art performance: short-term
mean-Recall (@10) increases by 3.4% while long-term mean-Recall (@50) improves
dramatically by 21.9%. Code is available at https://github.com/ZhuXMMM/OOTSM.

Motivation: 高能粒子物理中的堆积器污染问题与图像去器有相似性，希望将物理导向的偏向嵌入神经网络以提高高噪声条件下的稳健性

Method: 提出了一系列受堆积器启发的去器：包括带保守约束的残差CNN、高斯噪声变体以及WIPUNet（结合UNet架构和物理偏向的美化网络）

Result: 在CIFAR-10和BSD500数据集上，PU启发的CNN与标准基线相当，而WIPUNet在高噪声水平（σ=75,100）下显示出更大的优势，说明物理偏向提供了更好的稳健性

Conclusion: 物理受启发的引入偏向可以作为模块化组件集成到神经网络中，在不依赖重量级SOTA机制的情况下仍能在高噪声条件下提供稳健性收益

Abstract: In high-energy particle physics, collider measurements are contaminated by
"pileup", overlapping soft interactions that obscure the hard-scatter signal of
interest. Dedicated subtraction strategies exploit physical priors such as
conservation, locality, and isolation. Inspired by this analogy, we investigate
how such principles can inform image denoising by embedding physics-guided
inductive biases into neural architectures. This paper is a proof of concept:
rather than targeting state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks, we ask whether
physics-inspired priors improve robustness under strong corruption.
  We introduce a hierarchy of PU-inspired denoisers: a residual CNN with
conservation constraints, its Gaussian-noise variants, and the Weighted
Inductive Pileup-physics-inspired U-Network for Denoising (WIPUNet), which
integrates these ideas into a UNet backbone. On CIFAR-10 with Gaussian noise at
$\sigma\in\{15,25,50,75,100\}$, PU-inspired CNNs are competitive with standard
baselines, while WIPUNet shows a \emph{widening margin} at higher noise.
Complementary BSD500 experiments show the same trend, suggesting
physics-inspired priors provide stability where purely data-driven models
degrade. Our contributions are: (i) translating pileup-mitigation principles
into modular inductive biases; (ii) integrating them into UNet; and (iii)
demonstrating robustness gains at high noise without relying on heavy SOTA
machinery.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型和视觉语言大模型在单轮任务表现优秀，但在需要深度上下文理解和复杂视觉推理的多轮交互中存在推理碎片化、上下文丢失和幻觉问题

Method: 提出CAMVR框架，包含两个关键创新：1) 视觉-文本上下文记忆单元(VCMU) - 动态读写记忆网络，存储和管理每轮交互的关键视觉特征、文本语义表示及其跨模态对应关系；2) 自适应视觉聚焦指导(AVFG)机制 - 利用VCMU上下文动态调整视觉编码器对上下文相关图像区域的注意力

Result: 在VisDial、适配的A-OKVQA和新型多轮指令跟随(MTIF)数据集上的广泛实验表明，CAMVR始终达到最先进的性能

Conclusion: CAMVR框架有效解决了多轮视觉-文本推理中的上下文管理和视觉注意力问题，显著提升了模型的多轮交互能力

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs)
excel in single-turn tasks but face significant challenges in multi-turn
interactions requiring deep contextual understanding and complex visual
reasoning, often leading to fragmented reasoning, context loss, and
hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose Context-Aware
Multi-Turn Visual Reasoning (CAMVR), a novel framework designed to empower
LVLMs with robust and coherent multi-turn visual-textual inference
capabilities. CAMVR introduces two key innovations: a Visual-Textual Context
Memory Unit (VCMU), a dynamic read-write memory network that stores and manages
critical visual features, textual semantic representations, and their
cross-modal correspondences from each interaction turn; and an Adaptive Visual
Focus Guidance (AVFG) mechanism, which leverages the VCMU's context to
dynamically adjust the visual encoder's attention to contextually relevant
image regions. Our multi-level reasoning integration strategy ensures that
response generation is deeply coherent with both current inputs and accumulated
historical context. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets, including
VisDial, an adapted A-OKVQA, and our novel Multi-Turn Instruction Following
(MTIF) dataset, demonstrate that CAMVR consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像分割研究中的可重复性危机，特别是距离指标实现不可靠导致不同开源工具计算结果差异巨大（如Hausdorff距离差异超过100mm）

Method: 开发基于网格的框架MeshMetrics，相比传统基于网格的方法提供更精确的距离指标计算，减少离散化伪影影响

Result: 理论分析和实证验证表明MeshMetrics比现有工具具有更高的准确性和精度，受距离量化等离散化伪影影响显著减小

Conclusion: MeshMetrics作为开源Python包发布，为图像分割性能评估提供了更可靠的指标实现方案

Abstract: The surge of research in image segmentation has yielded remarkable
performance gains but also exposed a reproducibility crisis. A major
contributor is performance evaluation, where both selection and implementation
of metrics play critical roles. While recent efforts have improved the former,
the reliability of metric implementation has received far less attention.
Pitfalls in distance-based metric implementation can lead to considerable
discrepancies between common open-source tools, for instance, exceeding 100 mm
for the Hausdorff distance and 30%pt for the normalized surface distance for
the same pair of segmentations. To address these pitfalls, we introduce
MeshMetrics, a mesh-based framework that provides a more precise computation of
distance-based metrics than conventional grid-based approaches. Through
theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that MeshMetrics
achieves higher accuracy and precision than established tools, and is
substantially less affected by discretization artifacts, such as distance
quantization. We release MeshMetrics as an open-source Python package,
available at https://github.com/gasperpodobnik/MeshMetrics.

Motivation: 传统方法在深度语义理解、复杂上下文信息和细粒度区分方面存在局限，无法有效处理多样化视频数据。受大语言模型强大能力启发，希望利用视觉-语言大模型提升视频动作识别的准确性和可解释性。

Method: 提出Video-to-Semantic-Tokens (VST)模块，将原始视频序列转换为离散的语义和时间一致的"语义动作标记"，创建LVLM可理解的"动作叙述"。结合自然语言指令，通过LoRA微调的LVLM（如LLaVA-13B）进行动作分类和语义推理。

Result: 在NTU RGB+D和NTU RGB+D 120等挑战性基准测试中达到最先进或极具竞争力的性能：NTU RGB+D X-Sub达到94.1%，NTU RGB+D 120 X-Set达到90.0%。

Conclusion: LVLM-VAR框架成功将预训练视觉-语言大模型应用于视频动作识别，不仅显著提升了识别准确率，还通过生成自然语言解释大幅增强了模型的可解释性，为视频理解任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Human action recognition often struggles with deep semantic understanding,
complex contextual information, and fine-grained distinction, limitations that
traditional methods frequently encounter when dealing with diverse video data.
Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of large language models, this paper
introduces LVLM-VAR, a novel framework that pioneers the application of
pre-trained Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) to video action recognition,
emphasizing enhanced accuracy and interpretability. Our method features a
Video-to-Semantic-Tokens (VST) Module, which innovatively transforms raw video
sequences into discrete, semantically and temporally consistent "semantic
action tokens," effectively crafting an "action narrative" that is
comprehensible to an LVLM. These tokens, combined with natural language
instructions, are then processed by a LoRA-fine-tuned LVLM (e.g., LLaVA-13B)
for robust action classification and semantic reasoning. LVLM-VAR not only
achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance on challenging
benchmarks such as NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120, demonstrating significant
improvements (e.g., 94.1% on NTU RGB+D X-Sub and 90.0% on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Set),
but also substantially boosts model interpretability by generating natural
language explanations for its predictions.

neglecting the importance of spatial structural information in capturing
viewpoint-invariant features. To address this issue, we incorporate geometric
structural information from normal images and introduce a Joint perception
network to integrate RGB and Normal images (JRN-Geo). Our approach utilizes a
dual-branch feature extraction framework, leveraging a Difference-Aware Fusion
Module (DAFM) and Joint-Constrained Interaction Aggregation (JCIA) strategy to
enable deep fusion and joint-constrained semantic and structural information
representation. Furthermore, we propose a 3D geographic augmentation technique
to generate potential viewpoint variation samples, enhancing the network's
ability to learn viewpoint-invariant features. Extensive experiments on the
University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets validate the robustness of our method
against complex viewpoint ariations, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

retraining.

TL;DR: LiDAR-BIND-T扩展了多模态融合框架，通过时间一致性机制改进雷达/声纳到LiDAR的转换，提升SLAM性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多传感器融合中时间不一致性问题，提高下游SLAM任务的鲁棒性和性能

Method: 引入三种时间一致性机制：时间嵌入相似性对齐、运动对齐变换损失、窗口时间融合模块，并更新模型架构保持空间结构

Result: 在雷达/声纳到LiDAR转换中展示改进的时间和空间一致性，降低绝对轨迹误差，提高占用地图精度

Conclusion: LiDAR-BIND-T保持即插即用多模态融合能力，同时显著增强时间稳定性，为SLAM应用提供更好的鲁棒性和性能

Abstract: This paper extends LiDAR-BIND, a modular multi-modal fusion framework that
binds heterogeneous sensors (radar, sonar) to a LiDAR-defined latent space,
with mechanisms that explicitly enforce temporal consistency. We introduce
three contributions: (i) temporal embedding similarity that aligns consecutive
latents, (ii) a motion-aligned transformation loss that matches displacement
between predictions and ground truth LiDAR, and (iii) windows temporal fusion
using a specialised temporal module. We further update the model architecture
to better preserve spatial structure. Evaluations on radar/sonar-to-LiDAR
translation demonstrate improved temporal and spatial coherence, yielding lower
absolute trajectory error and better occupancy map accuracy in
Cartographer-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping). We propose
different metrics based on the Fr\'echet Video Motion Distance (FVMD) and a
correlation-peak distance metric providing practical temporal quality
indicators to evaluate SLAM performance. The proposed temporal LiDAR-BIND, or
LiDAR-BIND-T, maintains plug-and-play modality fusion while substantially
enhancing temporal stability, resulting in improved robustness and performance
for downstream SLAM.

Conclusion: Multi-LVI-SAM框架通过全景模型和外参补偿方法有效解决了多相机系统的数据处理问题，实现了高精度和鲁棒的状态估计

Abstract: We propose a multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial odometry framework,
Multi-LVI-SAM, which fuses data from multiple fisheye cameras, LiDAR and
inertial sensors for highly accurate and robust state estimation. To enable
efficient and consistent integration of visual information from multiple
fisheye cameras, we introduce a panoramic visual feature model that unifies
multi-camera observations into a single representation. The panoramic model
serves as a global geometric optimization framework that consolidates
multi-view constraints, enabling seamless loop closure and global pose
optimization, while simplifying system design by avoiding redundant handling of
individual cameras. To address the triangulation inconsistency caused by the
misalignment between each camera's frame and the panoramic model's frame, we
propose an extrinsic compensation method. This method improves feature
consistency across views and significantly reduces triangulation and
optimization errors, leading to more accurate pose estimation. We integrate the
panoramic visual feature model into a tightly coupled LiDAR-visual-inertial
system based on a factor graph. Extensive experiments on public datasets
demonstrate that the panoramic visual feature model enhances the quality and
consistency of multi-camera constraints, resulting in higher accuracy and
robustness than existing multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单图超分辨率方法假设空间不变的退化模型，但真实影像系统存在大气散射、景深变化等距离依赖效应，需要空间适应性的重构策略。

Method: 提出变分框架，将超分辨率形式化为空间变化逆问题，使用伪微分运算符描述退化模型。组织结构通过深度条件卷积核实现离散梯度流动力学，包含学习的距离适应性正则化项。

Result: 在5个标准数据集上达到最先进性能，在KITTI外景场景上在2倍和4倍缩放下分别获得36.89/0.9516和30.54/0.8721的PSNR/SSIM值，比现有方法分别提高0.44dB和0.36dB。

Conclusion: 这是第一个理论基础坚实的距离适应性超分辨率框架，在深度变化场景中显著改善了性能，同时在传统标准上保持竞争力。

Abstract: Single image super-resolution traditionally assumes spatially-invariant
degradation models, yet real-world imaging systems exhibit complex
distance-dependent effects including atmospheric scattering, depth-of-field
variations, and perspective distortions. This fundamental limitation
necessitates spatially-adaptive reconstruction strategies that explicitly
incorporate geometric scene understanding for optimal performance. We propose a
rigorous variational framework that characterizes super-resolution as a
spatially-varying inverse problem, formulating the degradation operator as a
pseudodifferential operator with distance-dependent spectral characteristics
that enable theoretical analysis of reconstruction limits across depth ranges.
Our neural architecture implements discrete gradient flow dynamics through
cascaded residual blocks with depth-conditional convolution kernels, ensuring
convergence to stationary points of the theoretical energy functional while
incorporating learned distance-adaptive regularization terms that dynamically
adjust smoothness constraints based on local geometric structure. Spectral
constraints derived from atmospheric scattering theory prevent bandwidth
violations and noise amplification in far-field regions, while adaptive kernel
generation networks learn continuous mappings from depth to reconstruction
filters. Comprehensive evaluation across five benchmark datasets demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance, achieving 36.89/0.9516 and 30.54/0.8721 PSNR/SSIM
at 2 and 4 scales on KITTI outdoor scenes, outperforming existing methods by
0.44dB and 0.36dB respectively. This work establishes the first
theoretically-grounded distance-adaptive super-resolution framework and
demonstrates significant improvements on depth-variant scenarios while
maintaining competitive performance across traditional benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有工作大多只关注单人动作或两人对话手势，假设身体朝向和位置基本不变，无法准确捕捉日常场景中两人动态、语义一致的长期互动行为。

Method: 构建了包含241个运动序列的多模态InterAct数据集，提出了基于扩散的分层回归方法，通过新颖的微调机制提高嘴唇动作准确性。

Result: InterAct数据集包含多样复杂的个体运动和长期互动模式，提出的方法能够从语音有效估计两人的互动面部表情和身体动作。

Conclusion: 该工作为解决两人动态互动行为建模提供了高质量数据集和有效方法，为相关研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: We address the problem of accurate capture of interactive behaviors between
two people in daily scenarios. Most previous works either only consider one
person or solely focus on conversational gestures of two people, assuming the
body orientation and/or position of each actor are constant or barely change
over each interaction. In contrast, we propose to simultaneously model two
people's activities, and target objective-driven, dynamic, and semantically
consistent interactions which often span longer duration and cover bigger
space. To this end, we capture a new multi-modal dataset dubbed InterAct, which
is composed of 241 motion sequences where two people perform a realistic and
coherent scenario for one minute or longer over a complete interaction. For
each sequence, two actors are assigned different roles and emotion labels, and
collaborate to finish one task or conduct a common interaction activity. The
audios, body motions, and facial expressions of both persons are captured.
InterAct contains diverse and complex motions of individuals and interesting
and relatively long-term interaction patterns barely seen before. We also
demonstrate a simple yet effective diffusion-based method that estimates
interactive face expressions and body motions of two people from speech inputs.
Our method regresses the body motions in a hierarchical manner, and we also
propose a novel fine-tuning mechanism to improve the lip accuracy of facial
expressions. To facilitate further research, the data and code is made
available at https://hku-cg.github.io/interact/ .

Conclusion: PARSE-VOS框架通过分层推理和训练免费的方式，有效解决了视频对象分割中的语言-视觉对齐难题，实现了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment an object of
interest throughout a video based on a language description. The prominent
challenge lies in aligning static text with dynamic visual content,
particularly when objects exhibiting similar appearances with inconsistent
motion and poses. However, current methods often rely on a holistic
visual-language fusion that struggles with complex, compositional descriptions.
In this paper, we propose \textbf{PARSE-VOS}, a novel, training-free framework
powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), for a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine
reasoning across text and video domains. Our approach begins by parsing the
natural language query into structured semantic commands. Next, we introduce a
spatio-temporal grounding module that generates all candidate trajectories for
all potential target objects, guided by the parsed semantics. Finally, a
hierarchical identification module select the correct target through a
two-stage reasoning process: it first performs coarse-grained motion reasoning
with an LLM to narrow down candidates; if ambiguity remains, a fine-grained
pose verification stage is conditionally triggered to disambiguate. The final
output is an accurate segmentation mask for the target object.
\textbf{PARSE-VOS} achieved state-of-the-art performance on three major
benchmarks: Ref-YouTube-VOS, Ref-DAVIS17, and MeViS.

Abstract: Deciphering oracle bone characters (OBCs), the oldest attested form of
written Chinese, has remained the ultimate, unwavering goal of scholars,
offering an irreplaceable key to understanding humanity's early modes of
production. Current decipherment methodologies of OBC are primarily constrained
by the sporadic nature of archaeological excavations and the limited corpus of
inscriptions. With the powerful visual perception capability of large
multimodal models (LMMs), the potential of using LMMs for visually deciphering
OBCs has increased. In this paper, we introduce PictOBI-20k, a dataset designed
to evaluate LMMs on the visual decipherment tasks of pictographic OBCs. It
includes 20k meticulously collected OBC and real object images, forming over
15k multi-choice questions. We also conduct subjective annotations to
investigate the consistency of the reference point between humans and LMMs in
visual reasoning. Experiments indicate that general LMMs possess preliminary
visual decipherment skills, and LMMs are not effectively using visual
information, while most of the time they are limited by language priors. We
hope that our dataset can facilitate the evaluation and optimization of visual
attention in future OBC-oriented LMMs. The code and dataset will be available
at https://github.com/OBI-Future/PictOBI-20k.

Abstract: In medical imaging, point distribution models are often used to reconstruct
and complete partial shapes using a statistical model of the full shape. A
commonly overlooked, but crucial factor in this reconstruction process, is the
pose of the training data relative to the partial target shape. A difference in
pose alignment of the training and target shape leads to biased solutions,
particularly when observing small parts of a shape. In this paper, we
demonstrate the importance of pose alignment for partial shape reconstructions
and propose an efficient method to adjust an existing model to a specific
target. Our method preserves the computational efficiency of linear models
while significantly improving reconstruction accuracy and predicted variance.
It exactly recovers the intended aligned model for translations, and provides a
good approximation for small rotations, all without access to the original
training data. Hence, existing shape models in reconstruction pipelines can be
adapted by a simple preprocessing step, making our approach widely applicable
in plug-and-play scenarios.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: PointPillars is the fastest 3D object detector that exploits pseudo image
representations to encode features for 3D objects in a scene. Albeit efficient,
PointPillars is typically outperformed by state-of-the-art 3D detection methods
due to the following limitations: 1) The pseudo image representations fail to
preserve precise 3D structures, and 2) they make it difficult to adopt a
two-stage detection pipeline using 3D object proposals that typically shows
better performance than a single-stage approach. We introduce in this paper the
first two-stage 3D detection framework exploiting pseudo image representations,
narrowing the performance gaps between PointPillars and state-of-the-art
methods, while retaining its efficiency. Our framework consists of two novel
components that overcome the aforementioned limitations of PointPillars: First,
we introduce a new CNN architecture, dubbed 3DPillars, that enables learning 3D
voxel-based features from the pseudo image representation efficiently using 2D
convolutions. The basic idea behind 3DPillars is that 3D features from voxels
can be viewed as a stack of pseudo images. To implement this idea, we propose a
separable voxel feature module that extracts voxel-based features without using
3D convolutions. Second, we introduce an RoI head with a sparse scene context
feature module that aggregates multi-scale features from 3DPillars to obtain a
sparse scene feature. This enables adopting a two-stage pipeline effectively,
and fully leveraging contextual information of a scene to refine 3D object
proposals. Experimental results on the KITTI and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, achieving a good
compromise in terms of speed and accuracy.

Motivation: 现有相机-雷达融合方法存在BEV特征稀疏（前向投影）和深度模糊导致误报（反向投影）的问题，需要一种能有效利用雷达精确深度信息来解决深度模糊的融合方法

Method: 使用反向投影结合雷达信息来减轻深度模糊，在视图变换过程中将透视图像特征聚合到BEV查询中，结合图像密集但不可靠的深度分布与雷达稀疏但精确的深度信息，并引入包含雷达上下文信息的空间交叉注意力机制

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上达到62.4% NDS和54.0% mAP，在基于反向投影的相机-雷达融合方法中实现最先进性能

Conclusion: CRAB模型通过有效融合相机和雷达的互补信息，成功解决了深度模糊问题，在3D目标检测任务中表现出优异的性能

Abstract: Recently, camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection methods in bird's eye
view (BEV) have gained attention due to the complementary characteristics and
cost-effectiveness of these sensors. Previous approaches using forward
projection struggle with sparse BEV feature generation, while those employing
backward projection overlook depth ambiguity, leading to false positives. In
this paper, to address the aforementioned limitations, we propose a novel
camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection and segmentation model named CRAB
(Camera-Radar fusion for reducing depth Ambiguity in Backward projection-based
view transformation), using a backward projection that leverages radar to
mitigate depth ambiguity. During the view transformation, CRAB aggregates
perspective view image context features into BEV queries. It improves depth
distinction among queries along the same ray by combining the dense but
unreliable depth distribution from images with the sparse yet precise depth
information from radar occupancy. We further introduce spatial cross-attention
with a feature map containing radar context information to enhance the
comprehension of the 3D scene. When evaluated on the nuScenes open dataset, our
proposed approach achieves a state-of-the-art performance among backward
projection-based camera-radar fusion methods with 62.4\% NDS and 54.0\% mAP in
3D object detection.

Motivation: 医疗设备制造中的视觉检测面临小样本、数据不平衡、高分辨率图像和严格监管要求的挑战，需要开发能够在这些约束下工作的深度异常检测方法。

Method: 提出了两种注意力引导的自编码器架构：第一种使用4-MS-SSIM结构相似性异常评分进行轻量级实时缺陷检测；第二种使用马氏距离在降维潜在特征上进行异常评分，用于监督监控。

Result: 第一种方法在仅有10%缺陷样本的情况下达到ACC 0.903（无监督阈值）和0.931（有监督阈值）；第二种方法达到ACC 0.722（有监督阈值），两种方法均优于重新实现的基线方法。

Abstract: Automating visual inspection in medical device manufacturing remains
challenging due to small and imbalanced datasets, high-resolution imagery, and
stringent regulatory requirements. This work proposes two attention-guided
autoencoder architectures for deep anomaly detection designed to address these
constraints. The first employs a structural similarity-based anomaly score
(4-MS-SSIM), offering lightweight and accurate real-time defect detection,
yielding ACC 0.903 (unsupervised thresholding) and 0.931 (supervised
thresholding) on the - Surface Seal Image - Test split with only 10% of
defective samples. The second applies a feature-distance approach using
Mahalanobis scoring on reduced latent features, providing high sensitivity to
distributional shifts for supervisory monitoring, achieving ACC 0.722 with
supervised thresholding. Together, these methods deliver complementary
capabilities: the first supports reliable inline inspection, while the second
enables scalable post-production surveillance and regulatory compliance
monitoring. Experimental results demonstrate that both approaches surpass
re-implemented baselines and provide a practical pathway for deploying deep
anomaly detection in regulated manufacturing environments, aligning accuracy,
efficiency, and the regulatory obligations defined for high-risk AI systems
under the EU AI Act.

Abstract: Recent advances in promptable segmentation, such as the Segment Anything
Model (SAM), have enabled flexible, high-quality mask generation across a wide
range of visual domains. However, SAM and similar models remain fundamentally
deterministic, producing a single segmentation per object per prompt, and fail
to capture the inherent ambiguity present in many real-world tasks. This
limitation is particularly troublesome in medical imaging, where multiple
plausible segmentations may exist due to annotation uncertainty or inter-expert
variability. In this paper, we introduce Probabilistic SAM, a probabilistic
extension of SAM that models a distribution over segmentations conditioned on
both the input image and prompt. By incorporating a latent variable space and
training with a variational objective, our model learns to generate diverse and
plausible segmentation masks reflecting the variability in human annotations.
The architecture integrates a prior and posterior network into the SAM
framework, allowing latent codes to modulate the prompt embeddings during
inference. The latent space allows for efficient sampling during inference,
enabling uncertainty-aware outputs with minimal overhead. We evaluate
Probabilistic SAM on the public LIDC-IDRI lung nodule dataset and demonstrate
its ability to produce diverse outputs that align with expert disagreement,
outperforming existing probabilistic baselines on uncertainty-aware metrics.

Abstract: Dust storms harm health and reduce visibility; quick detection from
satellites is needed. We present a near real-time system that flags dust at the
pixel level using multi-band images from NASA's Terra and Aqua (MODIS). A 3D
convolutional network learns patterns across all 36 bands, plus split thermal
bands, to separate dust from clouds and surface features. Simple normalization
and local filling handle missing data. An improved version raises training
speed by 21x and supports fast processing of full scenes. On 17 independent
MODIS scenes, the model reaches about 0.92 accuracy with a mean squared error
of 0.014. Maps show strong agreement in plume cores, with most misses along
edges. These results show that joint band-and-space learning can provide timely
dust alerts at global scale; using wider input windows or attention-based
models may further sharpen edges.

Motivation: 心血管组织分析图像的精确分割对心血管疾病研究和诊断至关重要，但深度学习模型发展受限于标注数据稀缺的挑战

Method: 系统性评估U-Net、DeepLabV3+、SegFormer以及SAM、MedSAM、MedSAM+UNet等先进分割模型，使用贝叶斯搜索进行涉参数优化，在有限的心血管组织学图像数据集上进行实验

Result: 模型性能对数据分割极为敏感，小的性能差异多由统计噪声导致，而非真正的算法优势，性能排名不稳定

Conclusion: 标准性能测试方法在低数据临床场景中有很大局限性，性能排名不能反映真正的临床效用，需要重新考虑模型评估方法

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of carotid artery structures in histopathological
images is vital for advancing cardiovascular disease research and diagnosis.
However, deep learning model development in this domain is constrained by the
scarcity of annotated cardiovascular histopathological data. This study
investigates a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning
segmentation models, including convolutional neural networks (U-Net,
DeepLabV3+), a Vision Transformer (SegFormer), and recent foundation models
(SAM, MedSAM, MedSAM+UNet), on a limited dataset of cardiovascular histology
images. Despite employing an extensive hyperparameter optimization strategy
with Bayesian search, our findings reveal that model performance is highly
sensitive to data splits, with minor differences driven more by statistical
noise than by true algorithmic superiority. This instability exposes the
limitations of standard benchmarking practices in low-data clinical settings
and challenges the assumption that performance rankings reflect meaningful
clinical utility.

TL;DR: BTCChat是一个多时相MLLM模型，通过设计变化提取模块和提示增强机制，显著提升了双时相卫星影像的变化理解和分析能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过直接拼接处理图像对，无法充分建模时间相关性和空间语义变化，限制了双时相变化分析的效果。

Method: 提出BTCChat模型，包含变化提取模块来捕获时间特征和空间语义变化，以及提示增强机制来提升对空间细节的关注。

Result: 实验结果表明BTCChat在变化描述和视觉问答任务上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: BTCChat通过创新的模块设计有效解决了双时相影像分析中的时空建模问题，为卫星影像分析提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: Bi-temporal satellite imagery supports critical applications such as urban
development monitoring and disaster assessment. Although powerful multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have been applied in bi-temporal change analysis,
previous methods process image pairs through direct concatenation, inadequately
modeling temporal correlations and spatial semantic changes. This deficiency
hampers visual-semantic alignment in change understanding, thereby constraining
the overall effectiveness of current approaches. To address this gap, we
propose BTCChat, a multi-temporal MLLM with advanced bi-temporal change
understanding capability. BTCChat supports bi-temporal change captioning and
retains single-image interpretation capability. To better capture temporal
features and spatial semantic changes in image pairs, we design a Change
Extraction module. Moreover, to enhance the model's attention to spatial
details, we introduce a Prompt Augmentation mechanism, which incorporates
contextual clues into the prompt to enhance model performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that BTCChat achieves state-of-the-art performance on
change captioning and visual question answering tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViSK-GAT是一个新颖的多模态深度学习框架，结合视觉和骨骼坐标特征来分类肌肉骨骼风险，在复杂环境中实现了93.89%的测试准确率，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有肌肉骨骼风险评估方法大多依赖单一数据类型，无法在复杂环境中可靠评估风险，需要开发能够融合多模态数据的解决方案。

Method: 提出ViSK-GAT框架，结合残差块和轻量级Transformer块学习时空依赖关系，包含细粒度注意力模块(FGAM)和多模态几何对应模块(MGCM)来实现跨模态特征精炼和对齐。

Result: 模型在验证集和测试集上分别达到93.55%和93.89%的准确率，精确度93.86%，F1分数93.85%，各项指标均显著优于9个流行的迁移学习骨干网络。

Conclusion: ViSK-GAT通过多模态融合和创新的注意力机制，显著提升了肌肉骨骼风险分类性能，为运动医学中的早期干预提供了有效的人工智能解决方案。

Abstract: Musculoskeletal disorders pose significant risks to athletes, and assessing
risk early is important for prevention. However, most existing methods are
designed for controlled settings and fail to reliably assess risk in complex
environments due to their reliance on a single type of data. This research
proposes ViSK-GAT (Visual-Skeletal Geometric Attention Transformer), a novel
multimodal deep learning framework designed to classify musculoskeletal risk
using visual and skeletal coordinate-based features. In addition, a custom
multimodal dataset is constructed by combining visual data and skeletal
coordinates for risk assessment. Each sample is labeled into eight risk
categories based on the Rapid Entire Body Assessment system. ViSK-GAT combines
a Residual Block with a Lightweight Transformer Block to learn spatial and
temporal dependencies jointly. It incorporates two novel modules: the
Fine-Grained Attention Module (FGAM), which enables precise inter-modal feature
refinement through cross-attention between visual and skeletal inputs, and the
Multimodal Geometric Correspondence Module (MGCM), which enhances cross-modal
coherence by aligning image features with coordinate-based representations.
ViSK-GAT achieved strong performance with validation and test accuracies of
93.55\% and 93.89\%, respectively; a precision of 93.86\%; an F1 score of
93.85\%; and Cohen's Kappa and Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 93\%. The
regression results also indicated a low Root Mean Square Error of the predicted
probability distribution of 0.1205 and a corresponding Mean Absolute Error of
0.0156. Compared to nine popular transfer learning backbones, ViSK-GAT
consistently outperformed previous methods. The ViSK-GAT model advances
artificial intelligence implementation and application, transforming
musculoskeletal risk classification and enabling impactful early interventions
in sports.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于CLIP模型的语义压缩方法，通过压缩特征嵌入而非像素重建，在极低比特率下保持语义完整性，相比主流方法节省95%以上比特率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新兴应用更关注语义保持而非像素级重建，需要跨数据分布和下游任务的鲁棒性能，现有深度学习方法无法满足这些需求

Method: 利用多模态基础模型的零样本和表示能力，提出基于CLIP模型的语义压缩方法，将CLIP特征嵌入压缩为最小比特同时保持跨任务语义信息

Result: 在基准数据集上保持语义完整性，平均比特率约2-3×10⁻³ bpp，仅为主流图像压缩方法所需比特率的不到5%，在极端压缩下仍具有跨数据分布和下游任务的零样本鲁棒性

Conclusion: 该方法为语义压缩提供了新范式，在极低比特率下实现了卓越的语义保持能力和跨域鲁棒性

Abstract: Recent deep learning-based methods for lossy image compression achieve
competitive rate-distortion performance through extensive end-to-end training
and advanced architectures. However, emerging applications increasingly
prioritize semantic preservation over pixel-level reconstruction and demand
robust performance across diverse data distributions and downstream tasks.
These challenges call for advanced semantic compression paradigms. Motivated by
the zero-shot and representational capabilities of multimodal foundation
models, we propose a novel semantic compression method based on the contrastive
language-image pretraining (CLIP) model. Rather than compressing images for
reconstruction, we propose compressing the CLIP feature embeddings into minimal
bits while preserving semantic information across different tasks. Experiments
show that our method maintains semantic integrity across benchmark datasets,
achieving an average bit rate of approximately 2-3* 10(-3) bits per pixel. This
is less than 5% of the bitrate required by mainstream image compression
approaches for comparable performance. Remarkably, even under extreme
compression, the proposed approach exhibits zero-shot robustness across diverse
data distributions and downstream tasks.

TL;DR: AttriPrompt是一个新颖的深度提示学习框架，通过利用CLIP视觉编码器的中间层特征来增强文本语义表示，解决了现有方法过度依赖对比学习和静态提示的问题，在三个基准测试中取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度文本提示方法存在两个关键局限：过度依赖对比学习目标而忽视细粒度特征优化；所有输入类别使用静态提示，缺乏内容感知适应能力。

Method: 提出AttriPrompt框架，包含属性检索模块（聚类视觉特征并检索语义相似提示）、双流对比学习实现细粒度对齐，以及自正则化机制防止过拟合。

Result: 在三个基准测试中优于最先进方法，在base-to-novel设置下实现了高达7.37%的性能提升，在跨域知识迁移方面表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法使视觉语言预训练模型成为现实世界应用中更可行的解决方案，通过层次化视觉信息和细粒度对齐显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: The evolution of prompt learning methodologies has driven exploration of
deeper prompt designs to enhance model performance. However, current deep text
prompting approaches suffer from two critical limitations: Over-reliance on
constrastive learning objectives that prioritize high-level semantic alignment,
neglecting fine-grained feature optimization; Static prompts across all input
categories, preventing content-aware adaptation. To address these limitations,
we propose AttriPrompt-a novel framework that enhances and refines textual
semantic representations by leveraging the intermediate-layer features of
CLIP's vision encoder. We designed an Attribute Retrieval module that first
clusters visual features from each layer. The aggregated visual features
retrieve semantically similar prompts from a prompt pool, which are then
concatenated to the input of every layer in the text encoder. Leveraging
hierarchical visual information embedded in prompted text features, we
introduce Dual-stream Contrastive Learning to realize fine-grained alignment.
Furthermore, we introduce a Self-Regularization mechanism by applying explicit
regularization constraints between the prompted and non-prompted text features
to prevent overfitting on limited training data. Extensive experiments across
three benchmarks demonstrate AttriPrompt's superiority over state-of-the-art
methods, achieving up to 7.37\% improvement in the base-to-novel setting. The
observed strength of our method in cross-domain knowledge transfer positions
vision-language pre-trained models as more viable solutions for real-world
implementation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SDE采样在Flow Matching中引入过多随机性，导致生成图像出现噪声伪影，影响奖励学习过程和生成质量。

Method: 受DDIM启发，提出Coefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS)方法，重新制定采样过程，消除噪声伪影。

Result: CPS方法有效消除噪声，实现更准确的奖励建模，使Flow-GRPO和Dance-GRPO等强化学习优化器收敛更快更稳定。

Conclusion: CPS采样方法解决了Flow Matching中RL应用的关键问题，为基于强化学习的图像视频生成优化提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently emerged as a powerful technique for
improving image and video generation in Diffusion and Flow Matching models,
specifically for enhancing output quality and alignment with prompts. A
critical step for applying online RL methods on Flow Matching is the
introduction of stochasticity into the deterministic framework, commonly
realized by Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE). Our investigation reveals a
significant drawback to this approach: SDE-based sampling introduces pronounced
noise artifacts in the generated images, which we found to be detrimental to
the reward learning process. A rigorous theoretical analysis traces the origin
of this noise to an excess of stochasticity injected during inference. To
address this, we draw inspiration from Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models
(DDIM) to reformulate the sampling process. Our proposed method,
Coefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS), eliminates these noise artifacts. This
leads to more accurate reward modeling, ultimately enabling faster and more
stable convergence for reinforcement learning-based optimizers like Flow-GRPO
and Dance-GRPO. Code will be released at https://github.com/IamCreateAI/FlowCPS

Method: 使用双向交叉注意力机制的DIFM模块，通过全局空间注意力精炼互补特征；引入基于梯度提取的多尺度边界损失

Result: 在ACDC和Synapse数据集上取得定量和定性的优越性能

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效利用原始和增强图像的互补信息，提升医学图像分割的边界准确性

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a crucial method for assisting professionals in
diagnosing various diseases through medical imaging. However, various factors
such as noise, blurriness, and low contrast often hinder the accurate diagnosis
of diseases. While numerous image enhancement techniques can mitigate these
issues, they may also alter crucial information needed for accurate diagnosis
in the original image. Conventional image fusion strategies, such as feature
concatenation can address this challenge. However, they struggle to fully
leverage the advantages of both original and enhanced images while suppressing
the side effects of the enhancements. To overcome the problem, we propose a
dual interactive fusion module (DIFM) that effectively exploits mutual
complementary information from the original and enhanced images. DIFM employs
cross-attention bidirectionally to simultaneously attend to corresponding
spatial information across different images, subsequently refining the
complementary features via global spatial attention. This interaction leverages
low- to high-level features implicitly associated with diverse structural
attributes like edges, blobs, and object shapes, resulting in enhanced features
that embody important spatial characteristics. In addition, we introduce a
multi-scale boundary loss based on gradient extraction to improve segmentation
accuracy at object boundaries. Experimental results on the ACDC and Synapse
datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method quantitatively and
qualitatively. Code available at: https://github.com/JJeong-Gari/DIN

Abstract: The deployment of high-accuracy 3D object detection models from point cloud
remains a significant challenge due to their substantial computational and
memory requirements. To address this, we introduce StripDet, a novel
lightweight framework designed for on-device efficiency. First, we propose the
novel Strip Attention Block (SAB), a highly efficient module designed to
capture long-range spatial dependencies. By decomposing standard 2D
convolutions into asymmetric strip convolutions, SAB efficiently extracts
directional features while reducing computational complexity from quadratic to
linear. Second, we design a hardware-friendly hierarchical backbone that
integrates SAB with depthwise separable convolutions and a simple multiscale
fusion strategy, achieving end-to-end efficiency. Extensive experiments on the
KITTI dataset validate StripDet's superiority. With only 0.65M parameters, our
model achieves a 79.97% mAP for car detection, surpassing the baseline
PointPillars with a 7x parameter reduction. Furthermore, StripDet outperforms
recent lightweight and knowledge distillation-based methods, achieving a
superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off while establishing itself as a practical
solution for real-world 3D detection on edge devices.

Motivation: 传统光环技术依靠多次模糊和纹理采样，包含条件分支，占用大量执行时间，是实时渲染的急需解决的性能瓶颈

Method: 提出两种神经网络基于光环打光方法：Neural Bloom Lighting (NBL) 和 Fast Neural Bloom Lighting (FastNBL)，分别重点关注质量和性能

Conclusion: 神经网络方法能够在节省计算资源的同时实现超过现有技术的速度，为实时环境中实现更高质量的现实效果提供了可行方案，对维持高FPS环境中的沉浸感和畅快体验至关重要

Abstract: We propose a novel method to generate bloom lighting effect in real time
using neural networks. Our solution generate brightness mask from given 3D
scene view up to 30% faster than state-of-the-art methods. The existing
traditional techniques rely on multiple blur appliances and texture sampling,
also very often have existing conditional branching in its implementation.
These operations occupy big portion of the execution time. We solve this
problem by proposing two neural network-based bloom lighting methods, Neural
Bloom Lighting (NBL) and Fast Neural Bloom Lighting (FastNBL), focusing on
their quality and performance. Both methods were tested on a variety of 3D
scenes, with evaluations conducted on brightness mask accuracy and inference
speed. The main contribution of this work is that both methods produce
high-quality bloom effects while outperforming the standard state-of-the-art
bloom implementation, with FastNBL being faster by 28% and NBL faster by 12%.
These findings highlight that we can achieve realistic bloom lighting phenomena
faster, moving us towards more realism in real-time environments in the future.
This improvement saves computational resources, which is a major bottleneck in
real-time rendering. Furthermore, it is crucial for sustaining immersion and
ensuring smooth experiences in high FPS environments, while maintaining
high-quality realism.

Motivation: 解决当前从通用2D视觉域演化而来的自监督方法在医疗3D图像中缺乏空间知识学习过程的直观展示和医学可解释性不足的问题。

Method: 设计了三个子任务来捐捕3D医学图像中的空间相关语义，遵循观察性原则确保可解释性，利用3D图像的增强语义深度进行多粒度空间关系建模以维持训练稳定性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的可解释自监督学习方法有效地解决了医疗3D图像中空间知识学习的可解释性问题，在保持性能的同时提供了更好的模型学习过程可视化。

Abstract: The application of self-supervised techniques has become increasingly
prevalent within medical visualization tasks, primarily due to its capacity to
mitigate the data scarcity prevalent in the healthcare sector. The majority of
current works are influenced by designs originating in the generic 2D visual
domain, which lack the intuitive demonstration of the model's learning process
regarding 3D spatial knowledge. Consequently, these methods often fall short in
terms of medical interpretability. We propose a method consisting of three
sub-tasks to capture the spatially relevant semantics in medical 3D imaging.
Their design adheres to observable principles to ensure interpretability, and
minimize the performance loss caused thereby as much as possible. By leveraging
the enhanced semantic depth offered by the extra dimension in 3D imaging, this
approach incorporates multi-granularity spatial relationship modeling to
maintain training stability. Experimental findings suggest that our approach is
capable of delivering performance that is on par with current methodologies,
while facilitating an intuitive understanding of the self-supervised learning
process.

Motivation: 解决艺术风格迁移中缺乏真实监督数据的基本挑战，通过去风格化方法获得风格-内容对齐的真实监督信号

Method: 1) 开发DST文本引导去风格化模型重建无风格内容；2) 创建DST-Filter多阶段评估模型使用思维链推理自动筛选高质量数据对；3) 基于DST-100K数据集训练FLUX.1-dev前馈模型

Result: OmniStyle2在定性和定量基准测试中一致超越最先进方法，证明了通过去风格化进行可扩展数据生成的有效性

Conclusion: 去风格化方法为艺术风格迁移提供了可靠的监督范式，克服了缺乏真实数据的基本挑战

Abstract: OmniStyle2 introduces a novel approach to artistic style transfer by
reframing it as a data problem. Our key insight is destylization, reversing
style transfer by removing stylistic elements from artworks to recover natural,
style-free counterparts. This yields DST-100K, a large-scale dataset that
provides authentic supervision signals by aligning real artistic styles with
their underlying content. To build DST-100K, we develop (1) DST, a text-guided
destylization model that reconstructs stylefree content, and (2) DST-Filter, a
multi-stage evaluation model that employs Chain-of-Thought reasoning to
automatically discard low-quality pairs while ensuring content fidelity and
style accuracy. Leveraging DST-100K, we train OmniStyle2, a simple feed-forward
model based on FLUX.1-dev. Despite its simplicity, OmniStyle2 consistently
surpasses state-of-the-art methods across both qualitative and quantitative
benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that scalable data generation via
destylization provides a reliable supervision paradigm, overcoming the
fundamental challenge posed by the lack of ground-truth data in artistic style
transfer.

Motivation: 解决深度神经网络在测试数据分布与训练数据不同时的性能下降问题，传统方法在处理有限训练域或大领域差距时效果有限

Method: 提出ConstStyle方法，利用统一域捕捉领域不变特征并弥合领域差距。训练时将样本映射到优化后的统一域，测试时类似投影后再进行预测

Result: 大量实验表明ConstStyle在各种场景下一致优于现有方法，特别是在有限训练域情况下，相比次优方法准确率提升高达19.82%

Conclusion: 通过统一域对齐训练和测试数据能有效减少领域偏移影响，即使在大领域差距或少量可见域情况下也能显著提升领域泛化性能

Abstract: Deep neural networks often suffer performance drops when test data
distribution differs from training data. Domain Generalization (DG) aims to
address this by focusing on domain-invariant features or augmenting data for
greater diversity. However, these methods often struggle with limited training
domains or significant gaps between seen (training) and unseen (test) domains.
To enhance DG robustness, we hypothesize that it is essential for the model to
be trained on data from domains that closely resemble unseen test domains-an
inherently difficult task due to the absence of prior knowledge about the
unseen domains. Accordingly, we propose ConstStyle, a novel approach that
leverages a unified domain to capture domain-invariant features and bridge the
domain gap with theoretical analysis. During training, all samples are mapped
onto this unified domain, optimized for seen domains. During testing, unseen
domain samples are projected similarly before predictions. By aligning both
training and testing data within this unified domain, ConstStyle effectively
reduces the impact of domain shifts, even with large domain gaps or few seen
domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConstStyle consistently
outperforms existing methods across diverse scenarios. Notably, when only a
limited number of seen domains are available, ConstStyle can boost accuracy up
to 19.82\% compared to the next best approach.

Conclusion: STRIDE模型通过创新的时序重加权引导和双网络架构，有效解决了稀疏视图CT重建的关键问题，实现了高质量的图像重建性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities in
image processing tasks. We propose a Sparse condition Temporal Rewighted
Integrated Distribution Estimation guided diffusion model (STRIDE) for
sparse-view CT reconstruction. Specifically, we design a joint training
mechanism guided by sparse conditional probabilities to facilitate the model
effective learning of missing projection view completion and global information
modeling. Based on systematic theoretical analysis, we propose a temporally
varying sparse condition reweighting guidance strategy to dynamically adjusts
weights during the progressive denoising process from pure noise to the real
image, enabling the model to progressively perceive sparse-view information.
The linear regression is employed to correct distributional shifts between
known and generated data, mitigating inconsistencies arising during the
guidance process. Furthermore, we construct a dual-network parallel
architecture to perform global correction and optimization across multiple
sub-frequency components, thereby effectively improving the model capability in
both detail restoration and structural preservation, ultimately achieving
high-quality image reconstruction. Experimental results on both public and real
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the best improvement of
2.58 dB in PSNR, increase of 2.37\% in SSIM, and reduction of 0.236 in MSE
compared to the best-performing baseline methods. The reconstructed images
exhibit excellent generalization and robustness in terms of structural
consistency, detail restoration, and artifact suppression.

Conclusion: 证明了理解输入数据可以平衡对额外传感器或训练数据的需求，分割信息的加入能够有效提升3D检测性能

Abstract: Monocular 3D Object Detection represents a challenging Computer Vision task
due to the nature of the input used, which is a single 2D image, lacking in any
depth cues and placing the depth estimation problem as an ill-posed one.
Existing solutions leverage the information extracted from the input by using
Convolutional Neural Networks or Transformer architectures as feature
extraction backbones, followed by specific detection heads for 3D parameters
prediction. In this paper, we introduce a decoupled strategy based on injecting
precomputed segmentation information priors and fusing them directly into the
feature space for guiding the detection, without expanding the detection model
or jointly learning the priors. The focus is on evaluating the impact of
additional segmentation information on existing detection pipelines without
adding additional prediction branches. The proposed method is evaluated on the
KITTI 3D Object Detection Benchmark, outperforming the equivalent architecture
that relies only on RGB image features for small objects in the scene:
pedestrians and cyclists, and proving that understanding the input data can
balance the need for additional sensors or training data.

Method: 采用人体位姿估计框架，结合Vision Transformer编码器和预训练光流模型，通过动态热力图和光流抓取运动信息，使用PnP求解器从2D关键点恢复6-DoF位姿

Result: 在SPADES-RGB数据集上训练和评估，在2D关键点定位和6-DoF位姿估计方面都超过了单图基线方法，同时在真实和合成数据上都显示了较好的演化能力

Conclusion: 通过结合动态信息，该方法能够有效提升单目太空船位姿估计的性能，为太空任务提供了更准确的位姿解决方案

Abstract: Monocular 6-DoF pose estimation plays an important role in multiple
spacecraft missions. Most existing pose estimation approaches rely on single
images with static keypoint localisation, failing to exploit valuable temporal
information inherent to space operations. In this work, we adapt a deep
learning framework from human pose estimation to the spacecraft pose estimation
domain that integrates motion-aware heatmaps and optical flow to capture motion
dynamics. Our approach combines image features from a Vision Transformer (ViT)
encoder with motion cues from a pre-trained optical flow model to localise 2D
keypoints. Using the estimates, a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) solver recovers
6-DoF poses from known 2D-3D correspondences. We train and evaluate our method
on the SPADES-RGB dataset and further assess its generalisation on real and
synthetic data from the SPARK-2024 dataset. Overall, our approach demonstrates
improved performance over single-image baselines in both 2D keypoint
localisation and 6-DoF pose estimation. Furthermore, it shows promising
generalisation capabilities when testing on different data distributions.

Abstract: As global interest in diverse culinary experiences grows, food image models
are essential for improving food-related applications by enabling accurate food
recognition, recipe suggestions, dietary tracking, and automated meal planning.
Despite the abundance of food datasets, a noticeable gap remains in capturing
the nuances of Indian cuisine due to its vast regional diversity, complex
preparations, and the lack of comprehensive labeled datasets that cover its
full breadth. Through this exploration, we uncover Khana, a new benchmark
dataset for food image classification, segmentation, and retrieval of dishes
from Indian cuisine. Khana fills the gap by establishing a taxonomy of Indian
cuisine and offering around 131K images in the dataset spread across 80 labels,
each with a resolution of 500x500 pixels. This paper describes the dataset
creation process and evaluates state-of-the-art models on classification,
segmentation, and retrieval as baselines. Khana bridges the gap between
research and development by providing a comprehensive and challenging benchmark
for researchers while also serving as a valuable resource for developers
creating real-world applications that leverage the rich tapestry of Indian
cuisine. Webpage: https://khana.omkar.xyz

Motivation: 视觉-语言模型在文档理解任务中表现突出，但高计算需求成为挑战。需要寻找方法降低计算成本。

Method: 使用二进制补丁级分类器删除非文本区域，通过最大池化精炼步骤恢复碎片化文本区域以提升空间一致性。

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs) has led to impressive
results in document understanding tasks, but their high computational demands
remain a challenge. To mitigate the compute burdens, we propose a lightweight
token pruning framework that filters out non-informative background regions
from document images prior to VLM processing. A binary patch-level classifier
removes non-text areas, and a max-pooling refinement step recovers fragmented
text regions to enhance spatial coherence. Experiments on real-world document
datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially lowers computational
costs, while maintaining comparable accuracy.

TL;DR: BLaVe-CoT是一个针对盲人和低视力用户的视觉问答框架，通过多候选答案生成、空间定位和思维链推理来处理模糊性问题，在VQA-AnswerTherapy基准测试中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 盲人和低视力用户拍摄的照片往往模糊或构图不佳，提出的视觉问题也经常模糊不清，导致多个有效答案。传统VQA系统假设单一答案和区域，无法满足这种需求。

Method: 使用LoRA调优的BLIP-2模型生成多样候选答案，通过PolyFormer进行空间定位，最后应用思维链推理模块评估答案是否指向相同或不同区域。

Result: 在VQA-AnswerTherapy基准测试中优于先前方法，对辅助环境中的模糊性和视觉噪声更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: VQA系统需要适应真实人类的不确定性，为盲人和低视力用户提供包容性支持。该工作强调了处理模糊性问题的重要性，并公开了代码以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) holds great potential for assisting Blind and
Low Vision (BLV) users, yet real-world usage remains challenging. Due to visual
impairments, BLV users often take blurry or poorly framed photos and face
difficulty in articulating specific questions about what they cannot fully see.
As a result, their visual questions are frequently ambiguous, and different
users may interpret them in diverse ways. This leads to multiple valid answers,
each grounded in different image regions-posing a mismatch with conventional
VQA systems that assume a single answer and region. To bridge this gap, we
present BLaVe-CoT, a VQA framework designed to reason about answer consistency
in the face of ambiguity. Our method proposes diverse candidate answers using a
LoRA-tuned BLIP-2 model, then grounds each answer spatially using PolyFormer,
and finally applies a chain-of-thought reasoning module to assess whether the
answers refer to the same or different regions. Evaluated on the
VQA-AnswerTherapy benchmark, BLaVe-CoT outperforms previous methods and proves
more robust to the ambiguity and visual noise common in assistive settings.
This work highlights the need for VQA systems that can adapt to real human
uncertainty and provide inclusive support for BLV users. To foster further
research and accessibility applications, we have made the code publicly
available at https://github.com/Accecwan/BLaVe-CoT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统一多模态模型在图像生成能力上虽有显著提升，但在指令遵循和细节保持方面仍与GPT-4o等紧密耦合理解与生成的系统存在差距

Method: 提出Interleaving Reasoning Generation (IRG)框架，交替进行文本推理和图像合成：首先生成文本思考指导初始图像，然后通过反思细化细节、视觉质量和美学，同时保持语义

Result: 在GenEval、WISE、TIIF、GenAI-Bench和OneIG-EN等基准测试中获得5-10个百分点的绝对增益，视觉质量和细粒度保真度显著改善

Conclusion: IRG框架通过交替推理和生成的方式有效提升了文本到图像生成的质量和细节保持能力，达到了最先进的性能水平

Abstract: Unified multimodal understanding and generation models recently have achieve
significant improvement in image generation capability, yet a large gap remains
in instruction following and detail preservation compared to systems that
tightly couple comprehension with generation such as GPT-4o. Motivated by
recent advances in interleaving reasoning, we explore whether such reasoning
can further improve Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. We introduce Interleaving
Reasoning Generation (IRG), a framework that alternates between text-based
thinking and image synthesis: the model first produces a text-based thinking to
guide an initial image, then reflects on the result to refine fine-grained
details, visual quality, and aesthetics while preserving semantics. To train
IRG effectively, we propose Interleaving Reasoning Generation Learning (IRGL),
which targets two sub-goals: (1) strengthening the initial think-and-generate
stage to establish core content and base quality, and (2) enabling high-quality
textual reflection and faithful implementation of those refinements in a
subsequent image. We curate IRGL-300K, a dataset organized into six decomposed
learning modes that jointly cover learning text-based thinking, and full
thinking-image trajectories. Starting from a unified foundation model that
natively emits interleaved text-image outputs, our two-stage training first
builds robust thinking and reflection, then efficiently tunes the IRG pipeline
in the full thinking-image trajectory data. Extensive experiments show SoTA
performance, yielding absolute gains of 5-10 points on GenEval, WISE, TIIF,
GenAI-Bench, and OneIG-EN, alongside substantial improvements in visual quality
and fine-grained fidelity. The code, model weights and datasets will be
released in: https://github.com/Osilly/Interleaving-Reasoning-Generation .

Conclusion: 该研究通过专门的无人机数据集和新的融合模块，有效解决了无人机图像检测中的域差问题，为无人机应用提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVD) has emerged as a pivotal technology
for applications involving Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, the
prevailing large-scale datasets for OVD pre-training are predominantly composed
of ground-level, natural images. This creates a significant domain gap, causing
models trained on them to exhibit a substantial drop in performance on UAV
imagery. To address this limitation, we first propose a refined UAV-Label
engine. Then we construct and introduce UAVDE-2M(contains over 2,000,000
instances and 1800 categories) and UAVCAP-15k(contains over 15,000 images).
Furthermore, we propose a novel Cross-Attention Gated Enhancement Fusion (CAGE)
module and integrate it into the YOLO-World-v2 architecture. Finally, extensive
experiments on the VisDrone and SIMD datasets verify the effectiveness of our
proposed method for applications in UAV-based imagery and remote sensing.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的细粒度动态感知（FDP）框架用于面部微表情识别，通过排序帧级特征来编码动态信息，并引入动态图像构建任务来缓解数据稀缺问题，在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有微表情识别方法存在局限性：手工特征需要关键帧，深度学习方法受限于小规模和低多样性的训练数据。需要一种能够有效捕捉微表情瞬态、细微和动态特性的新方法。

Method: 提出FDP框架：1）按时间顺序对帧级特征进行排序以编码动态信息；2）使用局部-全局特征感知transformer进行帧表示学习；3）通过排序评分器计算帧级特征的排序分数；4）时间维度池化获取动态表示；5）同时进行微表情分类和动态图像构建任务。

Result: 在CASME II、SAMM、CAS(ME)^2和CAS(ME)^3数据集上，F1分数分别比之前最佳结果提高了4.05%、2.50%、7.71%和2.11%，显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: FDP框架通过排序机制有效编码微表情的动态信息，动态图像构建任务有助于捕捉面部细微动作并缓解数据稀缺问题，为微表情识别提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Facial micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task, due to the
transience, subtlety, and dynamics of micro-expressions (MEs). Most existing
methods resort to hand-crafted features or deep networks, in which the former
often additionally requires key frames, and the latter suffers from small-scale
and low-diversity training data. In this paper, we develop a novel fine-grained
dynamic perception (FDP) framework for MER. We propose to rank frame-level
features of a sequence of raw frames in chronological order, in which the rank
process encodes the dynamic information of both ME appearances and motions.
Specifically, a novel local-global feature-aware transformer is proposed for
frame representation learning. A rank scorer is further adopted to calculate
rank scores of each frame-level feature. Afterwards, the rank features from
rank scorer are pooled in temporal dimension to capture dynamic representation.
Finally, the dynamic representation is shared by a MER module and a dynamic
image construction module, in which the former predicts the ME category, and
the latter uses an encoder-decoder structure to construct the dynamic image.
The design of dynamic image construction task is beneficial for capturing
facial subtle actions associated with MEs and alleviating the data scarcity
issue. Extensive experiments show that our method (i) significantly outperforms
the state-of-the-art MER methods, and (ii) works well for dynamic image
construction. Particularly, our FDP improves by 4.05%, 2.50%, 7.71%, and 2.11%
over the previous best results in terms of F1-score on the CASME II, SAMM,
CAS(ME)^2, and CAS(ME)^3 datasets, respectively. The code is available at

Conclusion: DVLO4D通过稀疏时空融合有效解决了传统方法的局限性，在精度、鲁棒性和效率方面都表现出色，为自主系统定位提供了优秀的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual-LiDAR odometry is a critical component for autonomous system
localization, yet achieving high accuracy and strong robustness remains a
challenge. Traditional approaches commonly struggle with sensor misalignment,
fail to fully leverage temporal information, and require extensive manual
tuning to handle diverse sensor configurations. To address these problems, we
introduce DVLO4D, a novel visual-LiDAR odometry framework that leverages sparse
spatial-temporal fusion to enhance accuracy and robustness. Our approach
proposes three key innovations: (1) Sparse Query Fusion, which utilizes sparse
LiDAR queries for effective multi-modal data fusion; (2) a Temporal Interaction
and Update module that integrates temporally-predicted positions with current
frame data, providing better initialization values for pose estimation and
enhancing model's robustness against accumulative errors; and (3) a Temporal
Clip Training strategy combined with a Collective Average Loss mechanism that
aggregates losses across multiple frames, enabling global optimization and
reducing the scale drift over long sequences. Extensive experiments on the
KITTI and Argoverse Odometry dataset demonstrate the superiority of our
proposed DVLO4D, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both
pose accuracy and robustness. Additionally, our method has high efficiency,
with an inference time of 82 ms, possessing the potential for the real-time
deployment.

Abstract: The reliable analysis of blood reports is important for health knowledge, but
individuals often struggle with interpretation, leading to anxiety and
overlooked issues. We explore the potential of general-purpose Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to address this challenge by automatically analyzing blood report
images. We conduct a comparative evaluation of three VLMs: Qwen-VL-Max, Gemini

100 diverse blood report images. Each model was prompted with clinically
relevant questions adapted to each blood report. The answers were then
processed using Sentence-BERT to compare and evaluate how closely the models
responded. The findings suggest that general-purpose VLMs are a practical and
promising technology for developing patient-facing tools for preliminary blood
report analysis. Their ability to provide clear interpretations directly from
images can improve health literacy and reduce the limitations to understanding
complex medical information. This work establishes a foundation for the future
development of reliable and accessible AI-assisted healthcare applications.
While results are encouraging, they should be interpreted cautiously given the

Conclusion: 集成细节保持下采样、边缘敏感表示、双域注意力和难度自适应回归为无人机电网小缺陷检测提供了实用高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated inspection of transmission lines using UAVs is hindered by the
difficulty of detecting small and ambiguous defects against complex
backgrounds. Conventional detectors often suffer from detail loss due to
strided downsampling, weak boundary sensitivity in lightweight backbones, and
insufficient integration of global context with local cues. To address these
challenges, we propose TinyDef-DETR, a DETR-based framework designed for
small-defect detection. The method introduces a stride-free space-to-depth
module for lossless downsampling, an edge-enhanced convolution for
boundary-aware feature extraction, a cross-stage dual-domain multi-scale
attention module to jointly capture global and local information, and a
Focaler-Wise-SIoU regression loss to improve localization of small objects.
Experiments conducted on the CSG-ADCD dataset demonstrate that TinyDef-DETR
achieves substantial improvements in both precision and recall compared to
competitive baselines, with particularly notable gains on small-object subsets,
while incurring only modest computational overhead. Further validation on the
VisDrone benchmark confirms the generalization capability of the proposed
approach. Overall, the results indicate that integrating detail-preserving
downsampling, edge-sensitive representations, dual-domain attention, and
difficulty-adaptive regression provides a practical and efficient solution for
UAV-based small-defect inspection in power grids.

Abstract: Recent advancements in aligning image and video generative models via GRPO
have achieved remarkable gains in enhancing human preference alignment.
However, these methods still face high computational costs from on-policy
rollouts and excessive SDE sampling steps, as well as training instability due
to sparse rewards. In this paper, we propose BranchGRPO, a novel method that
introduces a branch sampling policy updating the SDE sampling process. By
sharing computation across common prefixes and pruning low-reward paths and
redundant depths, BranchGRPO substantially lowers the per-update compute cost
while maintaining or improving exploration diversity. This work makes three
main contributions: (1) a branch sampling scheme that reduces rollout and
training cost; (2) a tree-based advantage estimator incorporating dense
process-level rewards; and (3) pruning strategies exploiting path and depth
redundancy to accelerate convergence and boost performance. Experiments on
image and video preference alignment show that BranchGRPO improves alignment
scores by 16% over strong baselines, while cutting training time by 50%.

Abstract: Buoyancy-driven heat transfer in closed cavities serves as a canonical
testbed for thermal design High-fidelity CFD modelling yields accurate thermal
field solutions, yet its reliance on expert-crafted physics models, fine
meshes, and intensive computation limits rapid iteration. Recent developments
in data-driven modeling, especially Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer new
alternatives for learning thermal-fluid behavior directly from simulation data,
particularly on irregular mesh structures. However, conventional GNNs often
struggle to capture long-range dependencies in high-resolution graph
structures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multi-stage GNN
architecture that leverages hierarchical pooling and unpooling operations to
progressively model global-to-local interactions across multiple spatial
scales. We evaluate the proposed model on our newly developed CFD dataset
simulating natural convection within a rectangular cavities with varying aspect
ratios where the bottom wall is isothermal hot, the top wall is isothermal
cold, and the two vertical walls are adiabatic. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves higher predictive accuracy,
improved training efficiency, and reduced long-term error accumulation compared
to state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN baselines. These findings underscore the
potential of the proposed multi-stage GNN approach for modeling complex heat
transfer in mesh-based fluid dynamics simulations.

Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel technique for reconstructing images from
projection-based nano- and microtomography. Our contribution focuses on
enhancing reconstruction quality, particularly for specimen composed of
homogeneous material phases connected by sharp edges. This is accomplished by
training a neural network to identify edges within subpictures. The trained
network is then integrated into a mathematical optimization model, to reduce
artifacts from previous reconstructions. To this end, the optimization approach
favors solutions according to the learned predictions, however may also
determine alternative solutions if these are strongly supported by the raw
data. Hence, our technique successfully incorporates knowledge about the
homogeneity and presence of sharp edges in the sample and thereby eliminates

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedSeqFT是一个顺序微调框架，通过最大数据相似性选择和知识蒸馏方案，在医学图像分割任务中实现了3.0%的平均Dice提升，并增强了模型的可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的并行微调方法隔离任务且无法利用共享知识，而多任务微调需要同时访问所有数据集且难以进行增量任务集成。

Method: 提出MedSeqFT框架，包含：(1)最大数据相似性选择，识别最能代表原始预训练分布的下游样本；(2)基于LoRA的知识蒸馏方案K&G RFT，平衡任务特定适应和预训练知识保留。

Result: 在10个3D分割任务的两个多任务数据集上，MedSeqFT始终优于最先进的微调策略，平均Dice提升3.0%。在未见任务上验证了其增强的可迁移性，特别是在肿瘤分割方面。

Conclusion: 顺序微调是适应基础模型到不断发展的临床任务的有效、知识保留的范式。

Abstract: Foundation models have become a promising paradigm for advancing medical
image analysis, particularly for segmentation tasks where downstream
applications often emerge sequentially. Existing fine-tuning strategies,
however, remain limited: parallel fine-tuning isolates tasks and fails to
exploit shared knowledge, while multi-task fine-tuning requires simultaneous
access to all datasets and struggles with incremental task integration. To
address these challenges, we propose MedSeqFT, a sequential fine-tuning
framework that progressively adapts pre-trained models to new tasks while
refining their representational capacity. MedSeqFT introduces two core
components: (1) Maximum Data Similarity (MDS) selection, which identifies
downstream samples most representative of the original pre-training
distribution to preserve general knowledge, and (2) Knowledge and
Generalization Retention Fine-Tuning (K&G RFT), a LoRA-based knowledge
distillation scheme that balances task-specific adaptation with the retention
of pre-trained knowledge. Extensive experiments on two multi-task datasets
covering ten 3D segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSeqFT consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning strategies, yielding substantial
performance gains (e.g., an average Dice improvement of 3.0%). Furthermore,
evaluations on two unseen tasks (COVID-19-20 and Kidney) verify that MedSeqFT
enhances transferability, particularly for tumor segmentation. Visual analyses
of loss landscapes and parameter variations further highlight the robustness of
MedSeqFT. These results establish sequential fine-tuning as an effective,
knowledge-retentive paradigm for adapting foundation models to evolving
clinical tasks. Code will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PathoHR-Bench基准测试来评估视觉语言模型在病理学领域的层次语义理解和组合推理能力，并开发了一种病理学特定的训练方案，通过生成增强和扰动样本进行多模态对比学习，在多个数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 病理图像分析对自动化肿瘤诊断至关重要，但由于组织图像的高结构相似性和细微形态变化，现有视觉语言模型难以捕捉结构化病理报告解释所需的复杂推理能力。

Method: 提出PathoHR-Bench基准测试评估模型能力，并开发病理学特定的视觉语言训练方案，通过生成增强和扰动样本进行多模态对比学习。

Result: 实验评估表明，该方法在PathoHR-Bench和六个额外病理数据集上实现了最先进的性能，证明了其在细粒度病理表示方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 现有视觉语言模型难以有效建模复杂的跨模态关系，限制了临床应用；提出的病理学特定训练方案通过多模态对比学习显著提升了模型性能，为自动化病理诊断提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate analysis of pathological images is essential for automated tumor
diagnosis but remains challenging due to high structural similarity and subtle
morphological variations in tissue images. Current vision-language (VL) models
often struggle to capture the complex reasoning required for interpreting
structured pathological reports. To address these limitations, we propose
PathoHR-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate VL models' abilities in
hierarchical semantic understanding and compositional reasoning within the
pathology domain. Results of this benchmark reveal that existing VL models fail
to effectively model intricate cross-modal relationships, hence limiting their
applicability in clinical setting. To overcome this, we further introduce a
pathology-specific VL training scheme that generates enhanced and perturbed
samples for multimodal contrastive learning. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on
PathoHR-Bench and six additional pathology datasets, highlighting its
effectiveness in fine-grained pathology representation.

*Giulia Bonino,Luca Alberto Rizzo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CARDIE是一种无监督图像聚类算法，基于颜色和亮度内容进行聚类，能够生成对图像增强更有意义的聚类结果，并可用于重采样图像增强数据集以提高色调映射和去噪算法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动图像聚类在计算机视觉中很重要，但在图像增强应用中受限，主要原因是难以定义对此任务有意义的聚类。

Method: 引入CARDIE无监督算法，基于图像的颜色和亮度内容进行聚类；同时提出量化图像增强算法对亮度分布和局部方差影响的方法。

Result: CARDIE产生的聚类比基于语义图像属性的聚类更适用于图像增强；利用CARDIE聚类重采样图像增强数据集可提高色调映射和去噪算法的性能。

Conclusion: CARDIE为图像增强提供了更有效的聚类方法，代码已公开在GitHub上以促进采用和确保可重现性。

Abstract: Automatic image clustering is a cornerstone of computer vision, yet its
application to image enhancement remains limited, primarily due to the
difficulty of defining clusters that are meaningful for this specific task. To
address this issue, we introduce CARDIE, an unsupervised algorithm that
clusters images based on their color and luminosity content. In addition, we
introduce a method to quantify the impact of image enhancement algorithms on
luminance distribution and local variance. Using this method, we demonstrate
that CARDIE produces clusters more relevant to image enhancement than those
derived from semantic image attributes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CARDIE
clusters can be leveraged to resample image enhancement datasets, leading to
improved performance for tone mapping and denoising algorithms. To encourage
adoption and ensure reproducibility, we publicly release CARDIE code on our
GitHub.

*Tang Sui,Songxi Yang,Qunying Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecSwin3D是一个基于Transformer的模型，能够从多光谱图像生成高光谱图像，同时保持空间和光谱质量，在PSNR、SAM和SSIM指标上显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多光谱和高光谱图像在农业、环境监测和城市规划中广泛应用，但存在空间分辨率与光谱分辨率之间的权衡。现有方法难以同时保持空间细节和光谱保真度。

Method: 提出SpecSwin3D模型，采用3D移位窗口Transformer框架，输入5个多光谱波段，重建224个高光谱波段。引入级联训练策略逐步扩展光谱范围，并设计优化的波段序列来更好地捕获成对关系。

Result: 模型达到PSNR 35.82 dB、SAM 2.40°、SSIM 0.96的性能，比基线MHF-Net提升5.6 dB PSNR，ERGAS降低一半以上。在土地利用分类和烧毁区域分割等下游任务中表现出实用价值。

Conclusion: SpecSwin3D通过Transformer架构和创新的训练策略，有效解决了多光谱到高光谱图像转换中的空间-光谱权衡问题，为相关应用提供了高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Multispectral and hyperspectral imagery are widely used in agriculture,
environmental monitoring, and urban planning due to their complementary spatial
and spectral characteristics. A fundamental trade-off persists: multispectral
imagery offers high spatial but limited spectral resolution, while
hyperspectral imagery provides rich spectra at lower spatial resolution. Prior
hyperspectral generation approaches (e.g., pan-sharpening variants, matrix
factorization, CNNs) often struggle to jointly preserve spatial detail and
spectral fidelity. In response, we propose SpecSwin3D, a transformer-based
model that generates hyperspectral imagery from multispectral inputs while
preserving both spatial and spectral quality. Specifically, SpecSwin3D takes
five multispectral bands as input and reconstructs 224 hyperspectral bands at
the same spatial resolution. In addition, we observe that reconstruction errors
grow for hyperspectral bands spectrally distant from the input bands. To
address this, we introduce a cascade training strategy that progressively
expands the spectral range to stabilize learning and improve fidelity.
Moreover, we design an optimized band sequence that strategically repeats and
orders the five selected multispectral bands to better capture pairwise
relations within a 3D shifted-window transformer framework. Quantitatively, our
model achieves a PSNR of 35.82 dB, SAM of 2.40{\deg}, and SSIM of 0.96,
outperforming the baseline MHF-Net by +5.6 dB in PSNR and reducing ERGAS by
more than half. Beyond reconstruction, we further demonstrate the practical
value of SpecSwin3D on two downstream tasks, including land use classification
and burnt area segmentation.

TL;DR: RetinaGuard是一个隐私保护框架，通过生成对抗掩蔽机制隐藏视网膜年龄信息，同时保持图像质量和疾病诊断价值，防止生物信息泄露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI从医学图像中提取生物标志物（如视网膜年龄）存在隐私风险，未经授权的使用可能导致生物信息泄露，侵犯个人隐私。

Method: 采用特征级生成对抗掩蔽机制，结合多对一知识蒸馏策略，利用视网膜基础模型和多样化的替代年龄编码器，提供对黑盒年龄预测模型的通用防御。

Result: RetinaGuard成功混淆视网膜年龄预测，对图像质量和病理特征表示影响最小，可灵活扩展到其他医学图像生物标志物。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了医学图像生物识别隐私问题，为保护敏感生物信息提供了可行的技术方案，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: The integration of AI with medical images enables the extraction of implicit
image-derived biomarkers for a precise health assessment. Recently, retinal
age, a biomarker predicted from fundus images, is a proven predictor of
systemic disease risks, behavioral patterns, aging trajectory and even
mortality. However, the capability to infer such sensitive biometric data
raises significant privacy risks, where unauthorized use of fundus images could
lead to bioinformation leakage, breaching individual privacy. In response, we
formulate a new research problem of biometric privacy associated with medical
images and propose RetinaGuard, a novel privacy-enhancing framework that
employs a feature-level generative adversarial masking mechanism to obscure
retinal age while preserving image visual quality and disease diagnostic
utility. The framework further utilizes a novel multiple-to-one knowledge
distillation strategy incorporating a retinal foundation model and diverse
surrogate age encoders to enable a universal defense against black-box age
prediction models. Comprehensive evaluations confirm that RetinaGuard
successfully obfuscates retinal age prediction with minimal impact on image
quality and pathological feature representation. RetinaGuard is also flexible
for extension to other medical image derived biomarkers. RetinaGuard is also
flexible for extension to other medical image biomarkers.

TL;DR: UniVerse-1是一个统一的多模态生成模型，能够同时生成协调的音频和视频内容，通过专家模型融合技术和在线标注流程实现高效训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决音频-视频生成中内容协调性和时间对齐的问题，避免基于文本标注的性能下降，开发一个能够同时生成高质量音频和视频的统一模型。

Method: 采用专家拼接技术，深度融合预训练的视频和音乐生成专家模型的对应模块；开发在线标注流程，在训练过程中处理和生成标签；使用约7600小时的音频-视频数据进行微调。

Result: 模型能够生成环境声音协调良好的音视频内容，并在语音生成方面表现出强对齐性；提出了新的基准数据集Verse-Bench进行系统评估。

Conclusion: UniVerse-1通过创新的专家融合和在线标注技术，在音视频生成任务上取得了良好效果，为研究社区提供了有价值的资源和工具，有助于缩小与最先进模型的性能差距。

Abstract: We introduce UniVerse-1, a unified, Veo-3-like model capable of
simultaneously generating coordinated audio and video. To enhance training
efficiency, we bypass training from scratch and instead employ a stitching of
experts (SoE) technique. This approach deeply fuses the corresponding blocks of
pre-trained video and music generation experts models, thereby fully leveraging
their foundational capabilities. To ensure accurate annotations and temporal
alignment for both ambient sounds and speech with video content, we developed
an online annotation pipeline that processes the required training data and
generates labels during training process. This strategy circumvents the
performance degradation often caused by misalignment text-based annotations.
Through the synergy of these techniques, our model, after being finetuned on
approximately 7,600 hours of audio-video data, produces results with
well-coordinated audio-visuals for ambient sounds generation and strong
alignment for speech generation. To systematically evaluate our proposed
method, we introduce Verse-Bench, a new benchmark dataset. In an effort to
advance research in audio-video generation and to close the performance gap
with state-of-the-art models such as Veo3, we make our model and code publicly
available. We hope this contribution will benefit the broader research
community. Project page: https://dorniwang.github.io/UniVerse-1/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UNO是一个统一的单阶段框架，用于视频场景图生成，可同时处理粗粒度边界框级别和细粒度像素级别的任务，通过扩展槽注意机制和时序一致性学习实现高效的多粒度视觉内容建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频场景图生成方法通常针对特定粒度（边界框或像素级别），需要任务特定的架构和多阶段训练流程，缺乏统一的解决方案。

Method: 提出UNO框架，采用扩展槽注意机制将视觉特征分解为对象和关系槽，引入对象时序一致性学习确保跨帧表示一致性，使用动态三元组预测模块捕捉时序交互。

Result: 在标准边界框和像素级别VidSGG基准测试中取得竞争性性能，同时通过统一的对象中心设计提高了效率。

Conclusion: UNO证明了单一框架可以有效地处理不同粒度的视频场景图生成任务，减少了任务特定的修改并最大化参数共享，为多粒度视觉内容分析提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) aims to represent dynamic visual
content by detecting objects and modeling their temporal interactions as
structured graphs. Prior studies typically target either coarse-grained
box-level or fine-grained panoptic pixel-level VidSGG, often requiring
task-specific architectures and multi-stage training pipelines. In this paper,
we present UNO (UNified Object-centric VidSGG), a single-stage, unified
framework that jointly addresses both tasks within an end-to-end architecture.
UNO is designed to minimize task-specific modifications and maximize parameter
sharing, enabling generalization across different levels of visual granularity.
The core of UNO is an extended slot attention mechanism that decomposes visual
features into object and relation slots. To ensure robust temporal modeling, we
introduce object temporal consistency learning, which enforces consistent
object representations across frames without relying on explicit tracking
modules. Additionally, a dynamic triplet prediction module links relation slots
to corresponding object pairs, capturing evolving interactions over time. We
evaluate UNO on standard box-level and pixel-level VidSGG benchmarks. Results
demonstrate that UNO not only achieves competitive performance across both
tasks but also offers improved efficiency through a unified, object-centric
design.

Motivation: 解决全球骨折诊断挑战，特别是在资源匮乏地区缺乏专业放射科医生的问题，传统方法成本高、有辐射且依赖专家解读

Method: 使用自定义卷积神经网络(CNN)，并与EfficientNetB0、MobileNetV2、ResNet50等迁移学习模型进行对比，在包含4,083张肌肉骨骼X光片的FracAtlas数据集上进行训练

Result: 自定义CNN达到95.96%准确率、0.94精确率、0.88召回率和0.91 F1分数，迁移学习模型在此特定设置下表现不佳

Conclusion: 轻量级CNN在X射线骨折检测中具有巨大潜力，强调公平基准测试、多样化数据集和外部验证对临床转化的重要性

Abstract: Bone fractures present a major global health challenge, often resulting in
pain, reduced mobility, and productivity loss, particularly in low-resource
settings where access to expert radiology services is limited. Conventional
imaging methods suffer from high costs, radiation exposure, and dependency on
specialized interpretation. To address this, we developed an AI-based solution
for automated fracture detection from X-ray images using a custom Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) and benchmarked it against transfer learning models
including EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, and ResNet50. Training was conducted on
the publicly available FracAtlas dataset, comprising 4,083 anonymized
musculoskeletal radiographs. The custom CNN achieved 95.96% accuracy, 0.94
precision, 0.88 recall, and an F1-score of 0.91 on the FracAtlas dataset.
Although transfer learning models (EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, ResNet50)
performed poorly in this specific setup, these results should be interpreted in
light of class imbalance and data set limitations. This work highlights the
promise of lightweight CNNs for detecting fractures in X-rays and underscores
the importance of fair benchmarking, diverse datasets, and external validation
for clinical translation

Abstract: Object Recognition and Document Skew Estimation have come a long way in terms
of performance and efficiency. New models follow one of two directions:
improving performance using larger models, and improving efficiency using
smaller models. However, real-time document detection and rectification is a
niche that is largely unexplored by the literature, yet it remains a vital step
for automatic information retrieval from visual documents. In this work, we
strive towards an efficient document detection pipeline that is satisfactory in
terms of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) retrieval and faster than other
available solutions. We adapt IWPOD-Net, a license plate detection network, and
train it for detection on NBID, a synthetic ID card dataset. We experiment with
data augmentation and cross-dataset validation with MIDV (another synthetic ID
and passport document dataset) to find the optimal scenario for the model.
Other methods from both the Object Recognition and Skew Estimation
state-of-the-art are evaluated for comparison with our approach. We use each
method to detect and rectify the document, which is then read by an OCR system.
The OCR output is then evaluated using a novel OCR quality metric based on the
Levenshtein distance. Since the end goal is to improve automatic information
retrieval, we use the overall OCR quality as a performance metric. We observe
that with a promising model, document rectification does not have to be perfect
to attain state-of-the-art performance scores. We show that our model is
smaller and more efficient than current state-of-the-art solutions while
retaining a competitive OCR quality metric. All code is available at

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在3D空间关系理解方面存在局限，而真实世界的具身AI智能体（如机器人和自动驾驶汽车）需要基于自我中心多视角观察的空间推理能力

Method: 创建包含8,600+问答对的Ego3D-Bench基准测试；提出Ego3D-VLM后训练框架，通过基于估计的全局3D坐标生成认知地图来增强3D空间推理

Result: 基准测试显示当前SOTA VLMs与人类水平存在显著性能差距；Ego3D-VLM在多选题上平均提升12%，在绝对距离估计上平均提升56%

Conclusion: Ego3D-Bench和Ego3D-VLM为在真实世界多视角环境中实现人类水平空间理解提供了有价值的工具，当前VLMs仍需改进空间理解能力

Abstract: Understanding 3D spatial relationships remains a major limitation of current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior work has addressed this issue by creating
spatial question-answering (QA) datasets based on single images or indoor
videos. However, real-world embodied AI agents such as robots and self-driving
cars typically rely on ego-centric, multi-view observations. To this end, we
introduce Ego3D-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial
reasoning abilities of VLMs using ego-centric, multi-view outdoor data.
Ego3D-Bench comprises over 8,600 QA pairs, created with significant involvement
from human annotators to ensure quality and diversity. We benchmark 16 SOTA
VLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini1.5-Pro, InternVL3, and Qwen2.5-VL. Our results
reveal a notable performance gap between human level scores and VLM
performance, highlighting that current VLMs still fall short of human level
spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose Ego3D-VLM, a
post-training framework that enhances 3D spatial reasoning of VLMs. Ego3D-VLM
generates cognitive map based on estimated global 3D coordinates, resulting in
12% average improvement on multi-choice QA and 56% average improvement on
absolute distance estimation. Ego3D-VLM is modular and can be integrated with
any existing VLM. Together, Ego3D-Bench and Ego3D-VLM offer valuable tools for
advancing toward human level spatial understanding in real-world, multi-view
environments.

Motivation: 皮肤屏障功能的定量指标（SH和TEWL）对公众监测皮肤状况很重要，但需要专业仪器测量，不便普及。希望通过自拍图像实现远程无接触测量。

Method: 构建多阶段系统：数据收集、预处理，提出Skin-Prior Adaptive Vision Transformer模型进行回归，采用对称对比正则化解决数据不平衡问题。

Result: 成功开发出从自拍面部图像估计SH和TEWL的方法，有效减少了因数据不平衡导致的模型偏差。

Conclusion: 这是首个从自拍图像进行皮肤评估的研究，填补了计算机视觉与皮肤护理研究的空白，为AI驱动的可访问皮肤分析开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Skin health and disease resistance are closely linked to the skin barrier
function, which protects against environmental factors and water loss. Two key
physiological indicators can quantitatively represent this barrier function:
skin hydration (SH) and trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL). Measurement of SH
and TEWL is valuable for the public to monitor skin conditions regularly,
diagnose dermatological issues, and personalize their skincare regimens.
However, these measurements are not easily accessible to general users unless
they visit a dermatology clinic with specialized instruments. To tackle this
problem, we propose a systematic solution to estimate SH and TEWL from selfie
facial images remotely with smartphones. Our solution encompasses multiple
stages, including SH/TEWL data collection, data preprocessing, and formulating
a novel Skin-Prior Adaptive Vision Transformer model for SH/TEWL regression.
Through experiments, we identified the annotation imbalance of the SH/TEWL data
and proposed a symmetric-based contrastive regularization to reduce the model
bias due to the imbalance effectively. This work is the first study to explore
skin assessment from selfie facial images without physical measurements. It
bridges the gap between computer vision and skin care research, enabling
AI-driven accessible skin analysis for broader real-world applications.

Motivation: 当前基于transformer的方法在标准场景定位表现良好，但在开放词汇场景（包含新物体类别）存在三个主要限制：视觉-语言模态对齐不完美、跨模态特征融合不足、语义原型信息利用不充分

Method: 提出PAML框架：使用ALBEF进行初始跨模态对齐编码；视觉判别特征编码器增强显著物体表示；原型发现和继承机制提取聚合多邻居语义原型；多阶段解码器进行综合多模态整合

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的广泛实验验证了方法的有效性，在标准场景表现有竞争力，在开放词汇场景达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: PAML框架通过系统解决跨模态对齐、特征融合和原型利用问题，显著提升了开放词汇视觉定位的性能

Abstract: Visual Grounding (VG) aims to utilize given natural language queries to
locate specific target objects within images. While current transformer-based
approaches demonstrate strong localization performance in standard scene (i.e,
scenarios without any novel objects), they exhibit notable limitations in
open-vocabulary scene (i.e, both familiar and novel object categories during
testing). These limitations primarily stem from three key factors: (1)
imperfect alignment between visual and linguistic modalities, (2) insufficient
cross-modal feature fusion, and (3) ineffective utilization of semantic
prototype information. To overcome these challenges, we present Prototype-Aware
Multimodal Learning (PAML), an innovative framework that systematically
addresses these issues through several key components: First, we leverage ALBEF
to establish robust cross-modal alignment during initial feature encoding.
Subsequently, our Visual Discriminative Feature Encoder selectively enhances
salient object representations while suppressing irrelevant visual context. The
framework then incorporates a novel prototype discovering and inheriting
mechanism that extracts and aggregates multi-neighbor semantic prototypes to
facilitate open-vocabulary recognition. These enriched features undergo
comprehensive multimodal integration through our Multi-stage Decoder before
final bounding box regression. Extensive experiments across five benchmark
datasets validate our approach, showing competitive performance in standard
scene while achieving state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary scene. Our
code is available at https://github.com/plankXie/PAML.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的GCD方法主要集中于静态图像，但仅靠静态视觉内容往往不能可靠地发现新类别。需要将GCD扩展到视频领域，利用时间维度信息来提升新类发现的性能。

Method: 提出了内存导向一致性对比学习框架(MCCL)，包含两个核心组件：一致性对比学习(CACL)和内存导向表征增强(MGRE)。CACL利用多视角时间特征估计一致性得分，MGRE通过双级内存缓冲区提供全局上下文。

Conclusion: 这项研究强调了时间信息在视频中发现新类别的重要性，提出的MCCL框架通过时间-空间线索和全局上下文的有效结合，显著提升了Video-GCD的性能。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an emerging and challenging
open-world problem that has garnered increasing attention in recent years. Most
existing GCD methods focus on discovering categories in static images. However,
relying solely on static visual content is often insufficient to reliably
discover novel categories. To bridge this gap, we extend the GCD problem to the
video domain and introduce a new setting, termed Video-GCD. Thus, effectively
integrating multi-perspective information across time is crucial for accurate
Video-GCD. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel Memory-guided
Consistency-aware Contrastive Learning (MCCL) framework, which explicitly
captures temporal-spatial cues and incorporates them into contrastive learning
through a consistency-guided voting mechanism. MCCL consists of two core
components: Consistency-Aware Contrastive Learning(CACL) and Memory-Guided
Representation Enhancement (MGRE). CACL exploits multiperspective temporal
features to estimate consistency scores between unlabeled instances, which are
then used to weight the contrastive loss accordingly. MGRE introduces a
dual-level memory buffer that maintains both feature-level and logit-level
representations, providing global context to enhance intra-class compactness
and inter-class separability. This in turn refines the consistency estimation
in CACL, forming a mutually reinforcing feedback loop between representation
learning and consistency modeling. To facilitate a comprehensive evaluation, we
construct a new and challenging Video-GCD benchmark, which includes action
recognition and bird classification video datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms competitive GCD
approaches adapted from image-based settings, highlighting the importance of
temporal information for discovering novel categories in videos. The code will
be publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出Text4Seg和Text4Seg++框架，将图像分割转化为文本生成问题，通过语义描述符和行级游程编码实现高效分割，无需额外解码器即可在多种视觉任务中达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型中图像分割的有效集成问题，传统方法需要额外解码器，过程复杂

Method: 提出文本作为掩码范式，使用语义描述符将图像块映射到文本标签；引入行级游程编码(R-RLE)压缩冗余文本；开发box-wise语义描述符和语义砖实现精确定位

Result: 在自然和遥感数据集上一致超越最先进模型，无需任务特定微调，推理速度提升3倍，描述符长度减少74%

Conclusion: 文本驱动的图像分割在多模态大语言模型框架中具有高效性、可扩展性和泛化性

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities
in vision-language tasks. However, effectively integrating image segmentation
into these models remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a
novel text-as-mask paradigm that casts image segmentation as a text generation
problem, eliminating the need for additional decoders and significantly
simplifying the segmentation process. Our key innovation is semantic
descriptors, a new textual representation of segmentation masks where each
image patch is mapped to its corresponding text label. We first introduce
image-wise semantic descriptors, a patch-aligned textual representation of
segmentation masks that integrates naturally into the language modeling
pipeline. To enhance efficiency, we introduce the Row-wise Run-Length Encoding
(R-RLE), which compresses redundant text sequences, reducing the length of
semantic descriptors by 74% and accelerating inference by $3\times$, without
compromising performance. Building upon this, our initial framework Text4Seg
achieves strong segmentation performance across a wide range of vision tasks.
To further improve granularity and compactness, we propose box-wise semantic
descriptors, which localizes regions of interest using bounding boxes and
represents region masks via structured mask tokens called semantic bricks. This
leads to our refined model, Text4Seg++, which formulates segmentation as a
next-brick prediction task, combining precision, scalability, and generative
efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on natural and remote sensing datasets
show that Text4Seg++ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models across
diverse benchmarks without any task-specific fine-tuning, while remaining
compatible with existing MLLM backbones. Our work highlights the effectiveness,
scalability, and generalizability of text-driven image segmentation within the
MLLM framework.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The precise characterization of plant morphology provides valuable insights
into plant environment interactions and genetic evolution. A key technology for
extracting this information is 3D segmentation, which delineates individual
plant organs from complex point clouds. Despite significant progress in general
3D computer vision domains, the adoption of 3D segmentation for plant
phenotyping remains limited by three major challenges: i) the scarcity of
large-scale annotated datasets, ii) technical difficulties in adapting advanced
deep neural networks to plant point clouds, and iii) the lack of standardized
benchmarks and evaluation protocols tailored to plant science. This review
systematically addresses these barriers by: i) providing an overview of
existing 3D plant datasets in the context of general 3D segmentation domains,
ii) systematically summarizing deep learning-based methods for point cloud
semantic and instance segmentation, iii) introducing Plant Segmentation Studio
(PSS), an open-source framework for reproducible benchmarking, and iv)
conducting extensive quantitative experiments to evaluate representative
networks and sim-to-real learning strategies. Our findings highlight the
efficacy of sparse convolutional backbones and transformer-based instance
segmentation, while also emphasizing the complementary role of modeling-based
and augmentation-based synthetic data generation for sim-to-real learning in
reducing annotation demands. In general, this study bridges the gap between
algorithmic advances and practical deployment, providing immediate tools for
researchers and a roadmap for developing data-efficient and generalizable deep
learning solutions in 3D plant phenotyping. Data and code are available at

TL;DR: 提出统一货币评估框架，集成面额分类、损坏量化和防伪检测三个模块，适用于资源受限环境下的实时货币评估


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有货币识别系统忽视可用性和真实性评估，特别是在低资源环境中对视觉障碍用户和离线验证支持不足，缺乏对物理损坏和伪造的检测能力

Method: 使用轻量级CNN模型进行面额分类，提出统一货币损坏指数(UCDI)量化损坏程度，采用基于特征的模板匹配进行假币检测

Result: 在82,000多张标注图像上测试，Custom_CNN模型实现高分类性能且参数少，UCDI提供连续可用性评分，假币检测模块在不同成像条件下可靠识别伪造纸币

Conclusion: 该框架支持实时设备端推理，解决了受限环境中的关键部署挑战，证明准确、可解释且紧凑的解决方案能够在实际场景中支持包容性货币评估

Abstract: Currency recognition systems often overlook usability and authenticity
assessment, especially in low-resource environments where visually impaired
users and offline validation are common. While existing methods focus on
denomination classification, they typically ignore physical degradation and
forgery, limiting their applicability in real-world conditions. This paper
presents a unified framework for currency evaluation that integrates three
modules: denomination classification using lightweight CNN models, damage
quantification through a novel Unified Currency Damage Index (UCDI), and
counterfeit detection using feature-based template matching. The dataset
consists of over 82,000 annotated images spanning clean, damaged, and
counterfeit notes. Our Custom_CNN model achieves high classification
performance with low parameter count. The UCDI metric provides a continuous
usability score based on binary mask loss, chromatic distortion, and structural
feature loss. The counterfeit detection module demonstrates reliable
identification of forged notes across varied imaging conditions. The framework
supports real-time, on-device inference and addresses key deployment challenges
in constrained environments. Results show that accurate, interpretable, and
compact solutions can support inclusive currency evaluation in practical
settings.

Abstract: Vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists
represent more than half of global traffic deaths, yet their detection remains
challenging in poor lighting, adverse weather, and unbalanced data sets. This
paper presents a multimodal detection framework that integrates RGB and thermal
infrared imaging with a fine-tuned YOLOv8 model. Training leveraged KITTI,
BDD100K, and Teledyne FLIR datasets, with class re-weighting and light
augmentations to improve minority-class performance and robustness, experiments
show that 640-pixel resolution and partial backbone freezing optimise accuracy
and efficiency, while class-weighted losses enhance recall for rare VRUs.
Results highlight that thermal models achieve the highest precision, and
RGB-to-thermal augmentation boosts recall, demonstrating the potential of
multimodal detection to improve VRU safety at intersections.

TL;DR: 通过基于物体检测的GO-Tokenizer模块，提升视频大语言模型的时间敏感理解能力，避免文本描述带来的令牌长度和噪声问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间敏感视频理解任务可以从帧内基于物体的信息中获益，但传统的文本注释方式会导致令牌长度增加和容易受到物体层面信息噪声的影响

Method: 设计GO-Tokenizer轻量级添加模块，利用现成的物体检测器实时编码紧凑的物体信息，替代文本描述方式

Result: 实验结果显示，使用GO-Tokenizer进行预训练的方法在性能上超过了原始视频-LLM模型和使用提示中文本物体描述的对照方法

Conclusion: GO-Tokenizer能够在不同模型、数据集和视频理解任务（如理性时间定位和密集描述）中普遍提升性能，为视频大语言模型提供了更高效的物体信息编码方案

Abstract: We propose to improve the time-sensitive video understanding (TSV) capability
of video large language models (Video-LLMs) with grounded objects (GO). We
hypothesize that TSV tasks can benefit from GO within frames, which is
supported by our preliminary experiments on LITA, a state-of-the-art Video-LLM
for reasoning temporal localization. While augmenting prompts with textual
description of these object annotations improves the performance of LITA, it
also introduces extra token length and susceptibility to the noise in object
level information. To address this, we propose GO-Tokenizer, a lightweight
add-on module for Video-LLMs leveraging off-the-shelf object detectors to
encode compact object information on the fly. Experimental results demonstrate
that pretraining with GO-Tokenizer outperforms the vanilla Video-LLM and its
counterpart utilizing textual description of objects in the prompt. The gain
generalizes across different models, datasets and video understanding tasks
such as reasoning temporal localization and dense captioning.

Method: 提出MVP-FAS框架，包含多视角注意力模块(MVS)和多文本补丁对齐模块(MTPA)，利用多个释义文本来生成泛化特征

Result: 在跨域数据集上超越了之前的最先进方法，表现出卓越的泛化性能

Conclusion: MVP-FAS通过充分利用CLIP的多文本和补丁嵌入能力，有效解决了面部防欺骗中的泛化问题

Abstract: Recent face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods have shown remarkable cross-domain
performance by employing vision-language models like CLIP. However, existing
CLIP-based FAS models do not fully exploit CLIP's patch embedding tokens,
failing to detect critical spoofing clues. Moreover, these models rely on a
single text prompt per class (e.g., 'live' or 'fake'), which limits
generalization. To address these issues, we propose MVP-FAS, a novel framework
incorporating two key modules: Multi-View Slot attention (MVS) and Multi-Text
Patch Alignment (MTPA). Both modules utilize multiple paraphrased texts to
generate generalized features and reduce dependence on domain-specific text.
MVS extracts local detailed spatial features and global context from patch
embeddings by leveraging diverse texts with multiple perspectives. MTPA aligns
patches with multiple text representations to improve semantic robustness.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVP-FAS achieves superior generalization
performance, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on cross-domain
datasets. Code: https://github.com/Elune001/MVP-FAS.

Abstract: Colorectal diseases, including inflammatory conditions and neoplasms, require
quick, accurate care to be effectively treated. Traditional diagnostic
pipelines require extensive preparation and rely on separate, individual
evaluations on histological images and colonoscopy footage, introducing
possible variability and inefficiencies. This pilot study proposes a unified
deep learning network that uses convolutional neural networks (CN N s) to
classify both histopathological slides and colonoscopy video frames in one
pipeline. The pipeline integrates class-balancing learning, robust
augmentation, and calibration methods to ensure accurate results. Static colon
histology images were taken from the PathMNIST dataset, and the lower
gastrointestinal (colonoscopy) videos were drawn from the HyperKvasir dataset.
The CNN architecture used was ResNet-50. This study demonstrates an
interpretable and reproducible diagnostic pipeline that unifies multiple
diagnostic modalities to advance and ease the detection of colorectal diseases.

Abstract: Drought stress is a major threat to global crop productivity, making its
early and precise detection essential for sustainable agricultural management.
Traditional approaches, though useful, are often time-consuming and
labor-intensive, which has motivated the adoption of deep learning methods. In
recent years, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer
architectures have been widely explored for drought stress identification;
however, these models generally rely on a large number of trainable parameters,
restricting their use in resource-limited and real-time agricultural settings.
To address this challenge, we propose a novel lightweight hybrid CNN framework
inspired by ResNet, DenseNet, and MobileNet architectures. The framework
achieves a remarkable 15-fold reduction in trainable parameters compared to
conventional CNN and Vision Transformer models, while maintaining competitive
accuracy. In addition, we introduce a machine unlearning mechanism based on a
gradient norm-based influence function, which enables targeted removal of
specific training data influence, thereby improving model adaptability. The
method was evaluated on an aerial image dataset of potato fields with
expert-annotated healthy and drought-stressed regions. Experimental results
show that our framework achieves high accuracy while substantially lowering
computational costs. These findings highlight its potential as a practical,
scalable, and adaptive solution for drought stress monitoring in precision
agriculture, particularly under resource-constrained conditions.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR),
traditional models often struggle to generalize across varying scale factors,
limiting their real-world applicability. To address this, we propose a plug-in
Scale-Aware Attention Module (SAAM) designed to retrofit modern fixed-scale SR
models with the ability to perform arbitrary-scale SR. SAAM employs
lightweight, scale-adaptive feature extraction and upsampling, incorporating
the Simple parameter-free Attention Module (SimAM) for efficient guidance and
gradient variance loss to enhance sharpness in image details. Our method
integrates seamlessly into multiple state-of-the-art SR backbones (e.g., SCNet,
HiT-SR, OverNet), delivering competitive or superior performance across a wide
range of integer and non-integer scale factors. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach enables robust multi-scale
upscaling with minimal computational overhead, offering a practical solution
for real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 脑转移症是盐症患者死亡的主要原因之一。虽然有定期MRI监测，但纵向形态分析工作量过大，导致随访图像无法得到详细注释，以及早期预测治疗效果的需求。

Abstract: Brain Metastases (BM) are a large contributor to mortality of patients with
cancer. They are treated with Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) and monitored
with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at regular follow-up intervals according
to treatment guidelines. Analyzing and quantifying this longitudinal imaging
represents an intractable workload for clinicians. As a result, follow-up
images are not annotated and merely assessed by observation. Response to
treatment in longitudinal imaging is being studied, to better understand growth
trajectories and ultimately predict treatment success or toxicity as early as
possible. In this study, we implement an automated pipeline to curate a large
longitudinal dataset of SRS treatment data, resulting in a cohort of 896 BMs in
177 patients who were monitored for >360 days at approximately two-month
intervals at Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV). We use a data-driven
clustering to identify characteristic trajectories. In addition, we predict 12
months lesion-level response using classical as well as graph machine learning
Graph Machine Learning (GML). Clustering revealed 5 dominant growth
trajectories with distinct final response categories. Response prediction
reaches up to 0.90 AUC (CI95%=0.88-0.92) using only pre-treatment and first
follow-up MRI with gradient boosting. Similarly, robust predictive performance
of up to 0.88 AUC (CI95%=0.86-0.90) was obtained using GML, offering more
flexibility with a single model for multiple input time-points configurations.
Our results suggest potential automation and increased precision for the
comprehensive assessment and prediction of BM response to SRS in longitudinal
MRI. The proposed pipeline facilitates scalable data curation for the
investigation of BM growth patterns, and lays the foundation for clinical
decision support systems aiming at optimizing personalized care.

TL;DR: 本文针对3D高斯泼溅在大型场景中的位置量化问题，提出了一种基于球坐标的新量化方案，以减小远距离投影误差。


<details>

Motivation: 在大型场景中，3DGS的输入视图通常来自有限空间区域，重建主要适用于相同区域的新视角（3DoF+）。传统量化方法在远距离投影时会产生较大像素误差，因为投影误差与投影点距离的平方倒数成正比。

Method: 提出基于球坐标的量化方案，通过分析位置误差对投影误差的影响，设计了一种能够适应不同距离投影需求的量化策略。在著名的Garden场景上验证了方法的率失真性能。

Result: 新量化方案有效降低了远距离投影时的像素误差，在保持重建质量的同时提高了量化效率。

Conclusion: 球坐标量化方案解决了3DGS在大型场景中的位置量化问题，为有限视角条件下的高质量3D重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a major breakthrough in 3D scene
reconstruction. With a number of views of a given object or scene, the
algorithm trains a model composed of 3D gaussians, which enables the production
of novel views from arbitrary points of view. This freedom of movement is
referred to as 6DoF for 6 degrees of freedom: a view is produced for any
position (3 degrees), orientation of camera (3 other degrees). On large scenes,
though, the input views are acquired from a limited zone in space, and the
reconstruction is valuable for novel views from the same zone, even if the
scene itself is almost unlimited in size. We refer to this particular case as
3DoF+, meaning that the 3 degrees of freedom of camera position are limited to
small offsets around the central position. Considering the problem of
coordinate quantization, the impact of position error on the projection error
in pixels is studied. It is shown that the projection error is proportional to
the squared inverse distance of the point being projected. Consequently, a new
quantization scheme based on spherical coordinates is proposed. Rate-distortion
performance of the proposed method are illustrated on the well-known Garden
scene.

Abstract: Video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) is challenging due to dynamic
environments. Existing methods face two main issues: (1) SAM-based methods
struggle to separate camouflaged object edges due to model freezing, and (2)
MLLM-based methods suffer from poor object separability as large language
models merge foreground and background. To address these issues, we propose a
novel VCOD method based on SAM and MLLM, called Phantom-Insight. To enhance the
separability of object edge details, we represent video sequences with temporal
and spatial clues and perform feature fusion via LLM to increase information
density. Next, multiple cues are generated through the dynamic foreground
visual token scoring module and the prompt network to adaptively guide and
fine-tune the SAM model, enabling it to adapt to subtle textures. To enhance
the separability of objects and background, we propose a decoupled
foreground-background learning strategy. By generating foreground and
background cues separately and performing decoupled training, the visual token
can effectively integrate foreground and background information independently,
enabling SAM to more accurately segment camouflaged objects in the video.
Experiments on the MoCA-Mask dataset show that Phantom-Insight achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various metrics. Additionally, its ability
to detect unseen camouflaged objects on the CAD2016 dataset highlights its
strong generalization ability.

Abstract: Muzzle patterns are among the most effective biometric traits for cattle
identification. Fast and accurate detection of the muzzle region as the region
of interest is critical to automatic visual cattle identification.. Earlier
approaches relied on manual detection, which is labor-intensive and
inconsistent. Recently, automated methods using supervised models like YOLO
have become popular for muzzle detection. Although effective, these methods
require extensive annotated datasets and tend to be trained data-dependent,
limiting their performance on new or unseen cattle. To address these
limitations, this study proposes a zero-shot muzzle detection framework based
on Grounding DINO, a vision-language model capable of detecting muzzles without
any task-specific training or annotated data. This approach leverages natural
language prompts to guide detection, enabling scalable and flexible muzzle
localization across diverse breeds and environments. Our model achieves a mean
Average Precision (mAP)@0.5 of 76.8\%, demonstrating promising performance
without requiring annotated data. To our knowledge, this is the first research
to provide a real-world, industry-oriented, and annotation-free solution for
cattle muzzle detection. The framework offers a practical alternative to
supervised methods, promising improved adaptability and ease of deployment in
livestock monitoring applications.

Motivation: 现有的超分辨率算法缺乏有效的全参考图像质量评估指标，需要开发符合人类视觉系统特性的评估方法

Result: 大量实验证明PBAN在超分辨率图像质量评估方面优于最先进的质量评估方法

Conclusion: PBAN通过双向注意力机制和自适应失真感知能力，为超分辨率图像提供了有效的质量评估解决方案

Abstract: Many super-resolution (SR) algorithms have been proposed to increase image
resolution. However, full-reference (FR) image quality assessment (IQA) metrics
for comparing and evaluating different SR algorithms are limited. In this work,
we propose the Perception-oriented Bidirectional Attention Network (PBAN) for
image SR FR-IQA, which is composed of three modules: an image encoder module, a
perception-oriented bidirectional attention (PBA) module, and a quality
prediction module. First, we encode the input images for feature
representations. Inspired by the characteristics of the human visual system, we
then construct the perception-oriented PBA module. Specifically, different from
existing attention-based SR IQA methods, we conceive a Bidirectional Attention
to bidirectionally construct visual attention to distortion, which is
consistent with the generation and evaluation processes of SR images. To
further guide the quality assessment towards the perception of distorted
information, we propose Grouped Multi-scale Deformable Convolution, enabling
the proposed method to adaptively perceive distortion. Moreover, we design
Sub-information Excitation Convolution to direct visual perception to both
sub-pixel and sub-channel attention. Finally, the quality prediction module is
exploited to integrate quality-aware features and regress quality scores.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed PBAN outperforms
state-of-the-art quality assessment methods.

Abstract: Cross-source point cloud registration, which aims to align point cloud data
from different sensors, is a fundamental task in 3D vision. However, compared
to the same-source point cloud registration, cross-source registration faces
two core challenges: the lack of publicly available large-scale real-world
datasets for training the deep registration models, and the inherent
differences in point clouds captured by multiple sensors. The diverse patterns
induced by the sensors pose great challenges in robust and accurate point cloud
feature extraction and matching, which negatively influence the registration
accuracy. To advance research in this field, we construct Cross3DReg, the
currently largest and real-world multi-modal cross-source point cloud
registration dataset, which is collected by a rotating mechanical lidar and a
hybrid semi-solid-state lidar, respectively. Moreover, we design an
overlap-based cross-source registration framework, which utilizes unaligned
images to predict the overlapping region between source and target point
clouds, effectively filtering out redundant points in the irrelevant regions
and significantly mitigating the interference caused by noise in
non-overlapping areas. Then, a visual-geometric attention guided matching
module is proposed to enhance the consistency of cross-source point cloud
features by fusing image and geometric information to establish reliable
correspondences and ultimately achieve accurate and robust registration.
Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
registration performance. Our framework reduces the relative rotation error
(RRE) and relative translation error (RTE) by $63.2\%$ and $40.2\%$,
respectively, and improves the registration recall (RR) by $5.4\%$, which
validates its effectiveness in achieving accurate cross-source registration.

Abstract: Deep neural networks currently dominate many fields of the artificial
intelligence landscape, achieving state-of-the-art results on numerous tasks
while remaining hard to understand and exhibiting surprising weaknesses. An
active area of research focuses on adversarial attacks, which aim to generate
inputs that uncover these weaknesses. However, this proves challenging,
especially in the black-box scenario where model details are inaccessible. This
paper explores in detail the impact of such adversarial algorithms on
ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, Swin Transformer V2, and Vision Transformer network
architectures. Leveraging the Tiny ImageNet, Caltech-256, and Food-101
datasets, we benchmark two novel black-box iterative adversarial algorithms
based on affine transformations and genetic algorithms: 1) Affine
Transformation Attack (ATA), an iterative algorithm maximizing our attack score
function using random affine transformations, and 2) Affine Genetic Attack
(AGA), a genetic algorithm that involves random noise and affine
transformations. We evaluate the performance of the models in the algorithm
parameter variation, data augmentation, and global and targeted attack
configurations. We also compare our algorithms with two black-box adversarial
algorithms, Pixle and Square Attack. Our experiments yield better results on
the image classification task than similar methods in the literature, achieving
an accuracy improvement of up to 8.82%. We provide noteworthy insights into
successful adversarial defenses and attacks at both global and targeted levels,
and demonstrate adversarial robustness through algorithm parameter variation.

Result: 实验表明CARVE能持续提升性能，在开源模型上实现高达75%的改进。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了视觉复杂度与注意力机制的相互作用，为通过对比注意力改进视觉推理提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across
diverse visual tasks, yet their performance degrades in complex visual
environments. While existing enhancement approaches require additional
training, rely on external segmentation tools, or operate at coarse-grained
levels, they overlook the innate ability within VLMs. To bridge this gap, we
investigate VLMs' attention patterns and discover that: (1) visual complexity
strongly correlates with attention entropy, negatively impacting reasoning
performance; (2) attention progressively refines from global scanning in
shallow layers to focused convergence in deeper layers, with convergence degree
determined by visual complexity. (3) Theoretically, we prove that the contrast
of attention maps between general queries and task-specific queries enables the
decomposition of visual signal into semantic signals and visual noise
components. Building on these insights, we propose Contrastive Attention
Refinement for Visual Enhancement (CARVE), a training-free method that extracts
task-relevant visual signals through attention contrasting at the pixel level.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CARVE consistently enhances performance,
achieving up to 75% improvement on open-source models. Our work provides
critical insights into the interplay between visual complexity and attention
mechanisms, offering an efficient pathway for improving visual reasoning with
contrasting attention.

Abstract: Realistic and parameterized 3D models of human anatomy have become invaluable
in research, diagnostics, and surgical planning. However, the development of
detailed models for internal organs, such as the stomach, has been limited by
data availability and methodological challenges. In this paper, we propose a
novel pipeline for the generation of synthetic 3D stomach models, enabling the
creation of anatomically diverse morphologies informed by established studies
on stomach shape variability. Using this pipeline, we construct a dataset of
synthetic stomachs. Building on this dataset, we develop a 3D statistical shape
model of the stomach, trained to capture natural anatomical variability in a
low-dimensional shape space. The model is further refined using CT meshes
derived from publicly available datasets through a semi-supervised alignment
process, enhancing its ability to generalize to unseen anatomical variations.
We evaluated the model on a held-out test set of real stomach CT scans,
demonstrating robust generalization and fit accuracy. We make the statistical
shape model along with the synthetic dataset publicly available on GitLab:
https://gitlab.com/Erez.Posner/stomach_pytorch to facilitate further research.
This work introduces the first statistical 3D shape model of the stomach, with
applications ranging from surgical simulation and pre-operative planning to
medical education and computational modeling. By combining synthetic data
generation, parametric modeling, and real-world validation, our approach
represents a significant advancement in organ modeling and opens new
possibilities for personalized healthcare solutions.

Abstract: The advent of large-scale vision foundation models, pre-trained on diverse
natural images, has marked a paradigm shift in computer vision. However, how
the frontier vision foundation models' efficacies transfer to specialized
domains remains such as medical imaging remains an open question. This report
investigates whether DINOv3, a state-of-the-art self-supervised vision
transformer (ViT) that features strong capability in dense prediction tasks,
can directly serve as a powerful, unified encoder for medical vision tasks
without domain-specific pre-training. To answer this, we benchmark DINOv3
across common medical vision tasks, including 2D/3D classification and
segmentation on a wide range of medical imaging modalities. We systematically
analyze its scalability by varying model sizes and input image resolutions. Our
findings reveal that DINOv3 shows impressive performance and establishes a
formidable new baseline. Remarkably, it can even outperform medical-specific
foundation models like BiomedCLIP and CT-Net on several tasks, despite being
trained solely on natural images. However, we identify clear limitations: The
model's features degrade in scenarios requiring deep domain specialization,
such as in Whole-Slide Pathological Images (WSIs), Electron Microscopy (EM),
and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Furthermore, we observe that DINOv3
does not consistently obey scaling law in the medical domain; performance does
not reliably increase with larger models or finer feature resolutions, showing
diverse scaling behaviors across tasks. Ultimately, our work establishes DINOv3
as a strong baseline, whose powerful visual features can serve as a robust
prior for multiple complex medical tasks. This opens promising future
directions, such as leveraging its features to enforce multiview consistency in
3D reconstruction.

Motivation: 解决高分辨率遥感图像变化检测中的两个关键挑战：1）模型容易将时间偏移（如光照、季节变化）导致的辐射变化误判为真实变化；2）深层抽象特征与浅层细节特征之间的语义鸿沟阻碍有效融合，导致边界模糊。

Conclusion: FSG-Net通过频域和空间域的协同处理，有效解决了变化检测中的伪变化问题和特征融合难题，在多个基准上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Change detection from high-resolution remote sensing images lies as a
cornerstone of Earth observation applications, yet its efficacy is often
compromised by two critical challenges. First, false alarms are prevalent as
models misinterpret radiometric variations from temporal shifts (e.g.,
illumination, season) as genuine changes. Second, a non-negligible semantic gap
between deep abstract features and shallow detail-rich features tends to
obstruct their effective fusion, culminating in poorly delineated boundaries.
To step further in addressing these issues, we propose the Frequency-Spatial
Synergistic Gated Network (FSG-Net), a novel paradigm that aims to
systematically disentangle semantic changes from nuisance variations.
Specifically, FSG-Net first operates in the frequency domain, where a
Discrepancy-Aware Wavelet Interaction Module (DAWIM) adaptively mitigates
pseudo-changes by discerningly processing different frequency components.
Subsequently, the refined features are enhanced in the spatial domain by a
Synergistic Temporal-Spatial Attention Module (STSAM), which amplifies the
saliency of genuine change regions. To finally bridge the semantic gap, a
Lightweight Gated Fusion Unit (LGFU) leverages high-level semantics to
selectively gate and integrate crucial details from shallow layers.
Comprehensive experiments on the CDD, GZ-CD, and LEVIR-CD benchmarks validate
the superiority of FSG-Net, establishing a new state-of-the-art with F1-scores
of 94.16%, 89.51%, and 91.27%, respectively. The code will be made available at
https://github.com/zxXie-Air/FSG-Net after a possible publication.

Abstract: In industrial quality control, to visually recognize unwanted items within a
moving heterogeneous stream, human operators are often still indispensable.
Waste-sorting stands as a significant example, where operators on multiple
conveyor belts manually remove unwanted objects to select specific materials.
To automate this recognition problem, computer vision systems offer great
potential in accurately identifying and segmenting unwanted items in such
settings. Unfortunately, considering the multitude and the variety of sorting
tasks, fully supervised approaches are not a viable option to address this
challange, as they require extensive labeling efforts. Surprisingly, weakly
supervised alternatives that leverage the implicit supervision naturally
provided by the operator in his removal action are relatively unexplored. In
this paper, we define the concept of Before-After Supervision, illustrating how
to train a segmentation network by leveraging only the visual differences
between images acquired \textit{before} and \textit{after} the operator. To
promote research in this direction, we introduce WS$^2$ (Weakly Supervised
segmentation for Waste-Sorting), the first multiview dataset consisting of more
than 11 000 high-resolution video frames captured on top of a conveyor belt,
including "before" and "after" images. We also present a robust end-to-end
pipeline, used to benchmark several state-of-the-art weakly supervised
segmentation methods on WS$^2$.

Conclusion: TIDE框架成功解决了主题驱动图像生成中的核心挑战，展示了在结构条件生成、图像到图像生成和文本图像插值等多种任务中的通用性

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation (SDIG) aims to manipulate specific subjects
within images while adhering to textual instructions, a task crucial for
advancing text-to-image diffusion models. SDIG requires reconciling the tension
between maintaining subject identity and complying with dynamic edit
instructions, a challenge inadequately addressed by existing methods. In this
paper, we introduce the Target-Instructed Diffusion Enhancing (TIDE) framework,
which resolves this tension through target supervision and preference learning
without test-time fine-tuning. TIDE pioneers target-supervised triplet
alignment, modelling subject adaptation dynamics using a (reference image,
instruction, target images) triplet. This approach leverages the Direct Subject
Diffusion (DSD) objective, training the model with paired "winning" (balanced
preservation-compliance) and "losing" (distorted) targets, systematically
generated and evaluated via quantitative metrics. This enables implicit reward
modelling for optimal preservation-compliance balance. Experimental results on
standard benchmarks demonstrate TIDE's superior performance in generating
subject-faithful outputs while maintaining instruction compliance,
outperforming baseline methods across multiple quantitative metrics. TIDE's
versatility is further evidenced by its successful application to diverse
tasks, including structural-conditioned generation, image-to-image generation,
and text-image interpolation. Our code is available at

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of the response of glioblastoma to therapy is crucial for
clinical decision-making and patient management. The Response Assessment in
Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria provide a standardized framework to assess
patients' clinical response, but their application can be complex and subject
to observer variability. This paper presents an automated method for
classifying the intervention response from longitudinal MRI scans, developed to
predict tumor response during therapy as part of the BraTS 2025 challenge. We
propose a novel hybrid framework that combines deep learning derived feature
extraction and an extensive set of radiomics and clinically chosen features.
Our approach utilizes a fine-tuned ResNet-18 model to extract features from 2D
regions of interest across four MRI modalities. These deep features are then
fused with a rich set of more than 4800 radiomic and clinically driven
features, including 3D radiomics of tumor growth and shrinkage masks,
volumetric changes relative to the nadir, and tumor centroid shift. Using the
fused feature set, a CatBoost classifier achieves a mean ROC AUC of 0.81 and a
Macro F1 score of 0.50 in the 4-class response prediction task (Complete
Response, Partial Response, Stable Disease, Progressive Disease). Our results
highlight that synergizing learned image representations with domain-targeted
radiomic features provides a robust and effective solution for automated
treatment response assessment in neuro-oncology.

Motivation: 检验Luo等人(2024)提出的FairCLIP方法的可重现性，调查其通过Sinkhorn距离减小图像-文本相似性分数差异来改善CLIP模型群体公平性的方法是否有效。

Method: 重现Luo等人的实验设置，发现原始实现与描述不一致后提出了A-FairCLIP实现，并扩展出支持多属性的FairCLIP+。在Harvard-FairVLMed数据集上进行零检照青光眼分类实验。

Result: 实验结果不支持FairCLIP改善CLIP性能和公平性的断言。虽然正则化目标减小了Sinkhorn距离，但既定实现和A-FairCLIP均未在零检照青光眼分类中显示出性能或公平性的改善。

Conclusion: 虽然CLIP在医疗图像分析中存在人口统计学偏见，但FairCLIP方法在当前实验设置下并不能有效改善模型的公平性和性能。

Abstract: We investigated the reproducibility of FairCLIP, proposed by Luo et al.
(2024), for improving the group fairness of CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) by
minimizing image-text similarity score disparities across sensitive groups
using the Sinkhorn distance. The experimental setup of Luo et al. (2024) was
reproduced to primarily investigate the research findings for FairCLIP. The
model description by Luo et al. (2024) was found to differ from the original
implementation. Therefore, a new implementation, A-FairCLIP, is introduced to
examine specific design choices. Furthermore, FairCLIP+ is proposed to extend
the FairCLIP objective to include multiple attributes. Additionally, the impact
of the distance minimization on FairCLIP's fairness and performance was
explored. In alignment with the original authors, CLIP was found to be biased
towards certain demographics when applied to zero-shot glaucoma classification
using medical scans and clinical notes from the Harvard-FairVLMed dataset.
However, the experimental results on two datasets do not support their claim
that FairCLIP improves the performance and fairness of CLIP. Although the
regularization objective reduces Sinkhorn distances, both the official
implementation and the aligned implementation, A-FairCLIP, were not found to
improve performance nor fairness in zero-shot glaucoma classification.

the pipelines originally taylored for these FMO datasets. Our comparison of
these state-of-the-art techniques on FMOX is provided with Trajectory
Intersection of Union (TIoU) scores. The code and JSON is shared open source
allowing FMOX to be accessible and usable for other machine learning pipelines
aiming to process FMO datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种针对场景级草图图像检索的训练方法，通过预训练、编码器架构和损失函数的适当组合，在不增加额外复杂度的情况下实现最先进性能，强调对草图模糊性和噪声的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注检索模型的架构增强，而忽视了真实世界草图中固有的模糊性和噪声问题，这促使设计专门针对草图变异性的鲁棒训练目标。

Method: 采用适当的预训练策略、编码器架构和损失函数组合，明确设计对草图变异性的鲁棒性训练目标，避免引入额外复杂度。

Result: 在具有挑战性的FS-COCO和广泛使用的SketchyCOCO数据集上进行广泛实验，证实了方法的有效性，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 研究强调了训练设计在跨模态检索任务中的关键作用，同时指出需要改进场景级SBIR的评估场景。

Abstract: The goal of Scene-level Sketch-Based Image Retrieval is to retrieve natural
images matching the overall semantics and spatial layout of a free-hand sketch.
Unlike prior work focused on architectural augmentations of retrieval models,
we emphasize the inherent ambiguity and noise present in real-world sketches.
This insight motivates a training objective that is explicitly designed to be
robust to sketch variability. We show that with an appropriate combination of
pre-training, encoder architecture, and loss formulation, it is possible to
achieve state-of-the-art performance without the introduction of additional
complexity. Extensive experiments on a challenging FS-COCO and widely-used
SketchyCOCO datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach and underline
the critical role of training design in cross-modal retrieval tasks, as well as
the need to improve the evaluation scenarios of scene-level SBIR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RARL方法解决增量开放集识别问题，通过角度表示学习和虚拟-内在交互训练策略，在持续数据流中有效识别新出现的未知类别并保持决策边界判别性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放集识别方法主要针对静态场景，无法适应持续数据流中新未知类别的增量识别需求，导致决策边界判别性下降和严重的类间混淆问题。

Method: 提出保持性角度表示学习(RARL)，在等角紧框架构建的角度空间中使未知表示对齐非活跃原型；采用虚拟-内在交互(VII)训练策略通过边界邻近虚拟类压缩已知表示；设计分层校正策略精炼决策边界。

Result: 在CIFAR100和TinyImageNet数据集上进行了全面评估，建立了IOSR新基准，在各种任务设置下均实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: RARL方法有效解决了增量开放集识别中的表示漂移和决策边界退化问题，为动态场景下的未知类别识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Existing open set recognition (OSR) methods are typically designed for static
scenarios, where models aim to classify known classes and identify unknown ones
within fixed scopes. This deviates from the expectation that the model should
incrementally identify newly emerging unknown classes from continuous data
streams and acquire corresponding knowledge. In such evolving scenarios, the
discriminability of OSR decision boundaries is hard to maintain due to
restricted access to former training data, causing severe inter-class
confusion. To solve this problem, we propose retentive angular representation
learning (RARL) for incremental open set recognition (IOSR). In RARL, unknown
representations are encouraged to align around inactive prototypes within an
angular space constructed under the equiangular tight frame, thereby mitigating
excessive representation drift during knowledge updates. Specifically, we adopt
a virtual-intrinsic interactive (VII) training strategy, which compacts known
representations by enforcing clear inter-class margins through
boundary-proximal virtual classes. Furthermore, a stratified rectification
strategy is designed to refine decision boundaries, mitigating representation
bias and feature space distortion caused by imbalances between old/new and
positive/negative class samples. We conduct thorough evaluations on CIFAR100
and TinyImageNet datasets and establish a new benchmark for IOSR. Experimental
results across various task setups demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数学形态学在矢量值图像（如彩色和高光谱图像）处理中缺乏统一的矢量排序方法，需要找到最合适的矢量排序来构建形态学算子

Method: 采用机器学习方法学习近似Condorcet排序的简化排序，Condorcet排序通过一组矢量排序的投票问题来对元素进行从最多到最少投票的排序

Result: 初步计算实验证实了学习简化映射在定义彩色图像矢量值形态学算子方面的有效性

Conclusion: 该方法为解决矢量排序问题提供了一种有效的机器学习解决方案，能够成功应用于彩色图像的形态学处理

Abstract: Mathematical morphology provides a nonlinear framework for image and spatial
data processing and analysis. Although there have been many successful
applications of mathematical morphology to vector-valued images, such as color
and hyperspectral images, there is still no consensus on the most suitable
vector ordering for constructing morphological operators. This paper addresses
this issue by examining a reduced ordering approximating the Condorcet ranking
derived from a set of vector orderings. Inspired by voting problems, the
Condorcet ordering ranks elements from most to least voted, with voters
representing different orderings. In this paper, we develop a machine learning
approach that learns a reduced ordering that approximates the Condorcet
ordering. Preliminary computational experiments confirm the effectiveness of
learning the reduced mapping to define vector-valued morphological operators
for color images.

TL;DR: CausNVS是一个自回归多视图扩散模型，支持任意输入-输出视图配置，通过序列化生成视图来解决现有方法固定视图数和推理慢的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多视图扩散模型大多采用非自回归形式，限制了在世界建模中的应用，因为它们只支持固定数量的视图，并且由于同时去噪所有帧而导致推理速度慢。

Method: 采用自回归设置，使用因果掩码和逐帧噪声训练，结合成对相对相机位姿编码(CaPE)实现精确相机控制。推理时使用空间感知滑动窗口、键值缓存和噪声条件增强来减轻漂移。

Result: 实验表明CausNVS支持广泛的相机轨迹，实现灵活的自回归新视图合成，并在多样化设置下保持一致的强视觉质量。

Conclusion: CausNVS通过自回归多视图扩散模型成功解决了现有方法的局限性，为3D新视图合成提供了更灵活高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-view diffusion models have shown promise in 3D novel view synthesis,
but most existing methods adopt a non-autoregressive formulation. This limits
their applicability in world modeling, as they only support a fixed number of
views and suffer from slow inference due to denoising all frames
simultaneously. To address these limitations, we propose CausNVS, a multi-view
diffusion model in an autoregressive setting, which supports arbitrary
input-output view configurations and generates views sequentially. We train
CausNVS with causal masking and per-frame noise, using pairwise-relative camera
pose encodings (CaPE) for precise camera control. At inference time, we combine
a spatially-aware sliding-window with key-value caching and noise conditioning
augmentation to mitigate drift. Our experiments demonstrate that CausNVS
supports a broad range of camera trajectories, enables flexible autoregressive
novel view synthesis, and achieves consistently strong visual quality across
diverse settings. Project page: https://kxhit.github.io/CausNVS.html.

Motivation: 数字化市场和社交媒体中非法野生动物贸易日益流行，需要自动化方法来处理巨量的数字内容以检测这种狂猎行为

Method: 开发机器学习对象识别模型，使用过去被罚没或非法销售的大象、亚洲狮、虎等动物产品图片进行训练，对比不同训练策略和损失函数

Result: 最佳模型整体准确率达84.2%，具体识别准确率：大象71.1%、亚洲狮90.2%、虎93.5%；手机应用整体准确率达91.3%

Conclusion: 该方法不仅可用于网络贸易监测，还能在实体市场实时识别潜在禁止野生动物产品，为政府和执法部门提供有效工具

Abstract: Unsustainable trade in wildlife is a major threat to biodiversity and is now
increasingly prevalent in digital marketplaces and social media. With the sheer
volume of digital content, the need for automated methods to detect wildlife
trade listings is growing. These methods are especially needed for the
automatic identification of wildlife products, such as ivory. We developed
machine learning-based object recognition models that can identify wildlife
products within images and highlight them. The data consists of images of
elephant, pangolin, and tiger products that were identified as being sold
illegally or that were confiscated by authorities. Specifically, the wildlife
products included elephant ivory and skins, pangolin scales, and claws (raw and
crafted), and tiger skins and bones. We investigated various combinations of
training strategies and two loss functions to identify the best model to use in
the automatic detection of these wildlife products. Models were trained for
each species while also developing a single model to identify products from all
three species. The best model showed an overall accuracy of 84.2% with
accuracies of 71.1%, 90.2% and 93.5% in detecting products derived from
elephants, pangolins, and tigers, respectively. We further demonstrate that the
machine learning model can be made easily available to stakeholders, such as
government authorities and law enforcement agencies, by developing a
smartphone-based application that had an overall accuracy of 91.3%. The
application can be used in real time to click images and help identify
potentially prohibited products of target species. Thus, the proposed method is
not only applicable for monitoring trade on the web but can also be used e.g.
in physical markets for monitoring wildlife trade.

TL;DR: 提出HSANet网络用于LDCT/PET图像去噪，结合高效全局注意力模块和混合上采样模块，在保持轻量级模型的同时实现优越的去噪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低剂量CT和PET虽然减少了辐射暴露，但会导致噪声和伪影增加，影响诊断准确性，因此需要有效的去噪方法来提升图像质量。

Method: 开发了混合Swin注意力网络(HSANet)，包含高效全局注意力(EGA)模块增强空间和通道交互，以及混合上采样模块防止过拟合噪声。

Result: 在公开LDCT/PET数据集上的实验表明，HSANet相比现有方法具有更好的去噪性能，同时保持轻量级模型大小，适合标准GPU部署。

Conclusion: HSANet为临床实际应用提供了高效实用的LDCT/PET图像去噪解决方案，在性能和部署便利性方面都有优势。

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) and positron emission tomography (PET)
have emerged as safer alternatives to conventional imaging modalities by
significantly reducing radiation exposure. However, this reduction often
results in increased noise and artifacts, which can compromise diagnostic
accuracy. Consequently, denoising for LDCT/PET has become a vital area of
research aimed at enhancing image quality while maintaining radiation safety.
In this study, we introduce a novel Hybrid Swin Attention Network (HSANet),
which incorporates Efficient Global Attention (EGA) modules and a hybrid
upsampling module. The EGA modules enhance both spatial and channel-wise
interaction, improving the network's capacity to capture relevant features,
while the hybrid upsampling module mitigates the risk of overfitting to noise.
We validate the proposed approach using a publicly available LDCT/PET dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that HSANet achieves superior denoising
performance compared to existing methods, while maintaining a lightweight model
size suitable for deployment on GPUs with standard memory configurations. This
makes our approach highly practical for real-world clinical applications.

Motivation: 植物在自然环境中面临多种交互影响的透劳，尤其是氮稠缺乏与干旱、杂草竞争合作用时更难识别。早期检测氮稠强度对保护植物健康和制定有效管理策略至关重要

Method: 提出新题深度学习框架，结合RGB、多光谱和两种红外波长四种影像模态，采用时间序列数据记录植物健康状态。核心是空间-时间深度学习流水线，融合CNN提取图像空间特征和LSTM捕捉时间依赖关系

Result: CNN-LSTM模型达到98%的高准确率，显著超过单纯空间CNN模型的80.45%和其他机器学习方法的76%准确率

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效捕捉氮稠缺乏、水分强度和杂草压力之间的细致复杂交互作用，为及旹预防急急识别氮稠强度提供了充分可靠的平台，有助于改善作物管理和提升植物健康

Abstract: Plants in their natural habitats endure an array of interacting stresses,
both biotic and abiotic, that rarely occur in isolation. Nutrient
stress-particularly nitrogen deficiency-becomes even more critical when
compounded with drought and weed competition, making it increasingly difficult
to distinguish and address its effects. Early detection of nitrogen stress is
therefore crucial for protecting plant health and implementing effective
management strategies. This study proposes a novel deep learning framework to
accurately classify nitrogen stress severity in a combined stress environment.
Our model uses a unique blend of four imaging modalities-RGB, multispectral,
and two infrared wavelengths-to capture a wide range of physiological plant
responses from canopy images. These images, provided as time-series data,
document plant health across three levels of nitrogen availability (low,
medium, and high) under varying water stress and weed pressures. The core of
our approach is a spatio-temporal deep learning pipeline that merges a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for extracting spatial features from images
with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies.
We also devised and evaluated a spatial-only CNN pipeline for comparison. Our
CNN-LSTM pipeline achieved an impressive accuracy of 98%, impressively
surpassing the spatial-only model's 80.45% and other previously reported
machine learning method's 76%. These results bring actionable insights based on
the power of our CNN-LSTM approach in effectively capturing the subtle and
complex interactions between nitrogen deficiency, water stress, and weed
pressure. This robust platform offers a promising tool for the timely and
proactive identification of nitrogen stress severity, enabling better crop
management and improved plant health.

TL;DR: 本文研究位置基于正则化对海底图像自监督学习的改善效果，在多个数据集和模型上都得到了一致性提升，特别是在低维隐藏表征下效果更为显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高速量解释机器人收集的海底视觉图像可以提高海洋监测和探索的效率。虽然最近的研究已经提出位置元数据可以增强自监督学习，但其在不同的SSL策略、模型和海底图像数据集上的好处仍然很少被探索。

Method: 这项研究评估了位置基于正则化对6种最先进的SSL框架的影响，包括卷积神经网络(CNN)和视觉Transformer(ViT)模型，这些模型具有不同的隐藏空间维度。在三个多样化的海底图像数据集上进行了评估。

Result: 位置正则化一致地提高了下游分类性能，超过了标准SSL。CNN的平均F1分数提升了4.9±4.0%，ViT提升了6.3±8.9%。在低维隐藏表征下，位置正则化的SSL对CNN的改善效果更为显著，超过预训练模型10.1±9.4%。

Conclusion: 研究结果突出了位置元数据对SSL正则化的价值，特别是在使用低维隐藏表征时。同时证明了高维ViT模型在海底图像分析中具有强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: High-throughput interpretation of robotically gathered seafloor visual
imagery can increase the efficiency of marine monitoring and exploration.
Although recent research has suggested that location metadata can enhance
self-supervised feature learning (SSL), its benefits across different SSL
strategies, models and seafloor image datasets are underexplored. This study
evaluates the impact of location-based regularisation on six state-of-the-art
SSL frameworks, which include Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision
Transformer (ViT) models with varying latent-space dimensionality. Evaluation
across three diverse seafloor image datasets finds that location-regularisation
consistently improves downstream classification performance over standard SSL,
with average F1-score gains of $4.9 \pm 4.0%$ for CNNs and $6.3 \pm 8.9%$ for
ViTs, respectively. While CNNs pretrained on generic datasets benefit from
high-dimensional latent representations, dataset-optimised SSL achieves similar
performance across the high (512) and low (128) dimensional latent
representations. Location-regularised SSL improves CNN performance over
pre-trained models by $2.7 \pm 2.7%$ and $10.1 \pm 9.4%$ for high and
low-dimensional latent representations, respectively. For ViTs,
high-dimensionality benefits both pre-trained and dataset-optimised SSL.
Although location-regularisation improves SSL performance compared to standard
SSL methods, pre-trained ViTs show strong generalisation, matching the
best-performing location-regularised SSL with F1-scores of $0.795 \pm 0.075$
and $0.795 \pm 0.077$, respectively. The findings highlight the value of
location metadata for SSL regularisation, particularly when using
low-dimensional latent representations, and demonstrate strong generalisation
of high-dimensional ViTs for seafloor image analysis.

TL;DR: 在线聚类框架OCF能够在无监督情况下实时解释海底图像，通过代表性样本采集策略实现高效的在线聚类，在三个海底图像数据集上达到平均F1得0.68的最佳性能，计算成本持续低且受限。


<details>

Motivation: 随着长时间潜水和海底居留AUV能力的提升，需要实时解释海底图像以支持适应性任务和优化通信效率。传统离线图像分析方法需要完整数据集和人工标注，无法满足实时场景的需求。

Method: 提出了一种在线聚类框架(OCF)，能够在无监督情况下处理连续数据流。该方法通过识别和维护一组代表性样本来捐描演化的特征分布，支持动态聚类合并和分割，而无需重新处理整个图像历史。

Result: 在三个多样化海底图像数据集上评估，OCF在所有比较性在线聚类方法中获得最高平均F1得0.68，标准偏差为3%，显示了其优秀的聚类能力和对调查轨迹变化的稳健性。同时，随着数据量增加，计算时间保持一致低且受限。

Conclusion: OCF框架具有重要价值，特别是在生成调查数据摘要和支持长期持续自主海洋探索中的信息化路径规划方面。该方法为实时海底图像解释提供了可扩展、适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: As long-endurance and seafloor-resident AUVs become more capable, there is an
increasing need for extended, real-time interpretation of seafloor imagery to
enable adaptive missions and optimise communication efficiency. Although
offline image analysis methods are well established, they rely on access to
complete datasets and human-labelled examples to manage the strong influence of
environmental and operational conditions on seafloor image
appearance-requirements that cannot be met in real-time settings. To address
this, we introduce an online clustering framework (OCF) capable of interpreting
seafloor imagery without supervision, which is designed to operate in real-time
on continuous data streams in a scalable, adaptive, and self-consistent manner.
The method enables the efficient review and consolidation of common patterns
across the entire data history in constant time by identifying and maintaining
a set of representative samples that capture the evolving feature distribution,
supporting dynamic cluster merging and splitting without reprocessing the full
image history. We evaluate the framework on three diverse seafloor image
datasets, analysing the impact of different representative sampling strategies
on both clustering accuracy and computational cost. The OCF achieves the
highest average F1 score of 0.68 across the three datasets among all
comparative online clustering approaches, with a standard deviation of 3%
across three distinct survey trajectories, demonstrating its superior
clustering capability and robustness to trajectory variation. In addition, it
maintains consistently lower and bounded computational time as the data volume
increases. These properties are beneficial for generating survey data summaries
and supporting informative path planning in long-term, persistent autonomous
marine exploration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统高斯泼溅方法需要准确的深度信息，通常依赖RGB-D或立体相机，但这些设备深度感知范围有限，难以处理大场景。单目图像缺乏深度信息，导致新视角合成效果不佳。虽然大基础模型可用于单目深度估计，但存在跨帧不一致、远距离场景不准确和纹理欺骗等问题。

Method: 利用视觉惯性SfM提供的准确但稀疏的深度来优化大基础模型生成的密集但粗糙的深度。提出对象分割深度传播算法来处理结构化对象的深度渲染，并开发动态深度优化模块来处理动态对象的SfM深度问题。

Result: 在公开和定制数据集上的实验表明，VIM-GS在大场景中具有优越的渲染质量。

Conclusion: VIM-GS成功解决了大场景中单目深度估计的挑战，通过结合稀疏和密集深度信息的优势，实现了高质量的新视角合成。

Abstract: VIM-GS is a Gaussian Splatting (GS) framework using monocular images for
novel-view synthesis (NVS) in large scenes. GS typically requires accurate
depth to initiate Gaussian ellipsoids using RGB-D/stereo cameras. Their limited
depth sensing range makes it difficult for GS to work in large scenes.
Monocular images, however, lack depth to guide the learning and lead to
inferior NVS results. Although large foundation models (LFMs) for monocular
depth estimation are available, they suffer from cross-frame inconsistency,
inaccuracy for distant scenes, and ambiguity in deceptive texture cues. This
paper aims to generate dense, accurate depth images from monocular RGB inputs
for high-definite GS rendering. The key idea is to leverage the accurate but
sparse depth from visual-inertial Structure-from-Motion (SfM) to refine the
dense but coarse depth from LFMs. To bridge the sparse input and dense output,
we propose an object-segmented depth propagation algorithm that renders the
depth of pixels of structured objects. Then we develop a dynamic depth
refinement module to handle the crippled SfM depth of dynamic objects and
refine the coarse LFM depth. Experiments using public and customized datasets
demonstrate the superior rendering quality of VIM-GS in large scenes.

Abstract: Bioprinting is a rapidly advancing field that offers a transformative
approach to fabricating tissue and organ models through the precise deposition
of cell-laden bioinks. Ensuring the fidelity and consistency of printed
structures in real-time remains a core challenge, particularly under
constraints imposed by limited imaging data and resource-constrained embedded
hardware. Semantic segmentation of the extrusion process, differentiating
between nozzle, extruded bioink, and surrounding background, enables in situ
monitoring critical to maintaining print quality and biological viability. In
this work, we introduce a lightweight semantic segmentation framework tailored
for real-time bioprinting applications. We present a novel, manually annotated
dataset comprising 787 RGB images captured during the bioprinting process,
labeled across three classes: nozzle, bioink, and background. To achieve fast
and efficient inference suitable for integration with bioprinting systems, we
propose a BioLite U-Net architecture that leverages depthwise separable
convolutions to drastically reduce computational load without compromising
accuracy. Our model is benchmarked against MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3-based
segmentation baselines using mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice score,
and pixel accuracy. All models were evaluated on a Raspberry Pi 4B to assess
real-world feasibility. The proposed BioLite U-Net achieves an mIoU of 92.85%
and a Dice score of 96.17%, while being over 1300x smaller than
MobileNetV2-DeepLabV3+. On-device inference takes 335 ms per frame,
demonstrating near real-time capability. Compared to MobileNet baselines,
BioLite U-Net offers a superior tradeoff between segmentation accuracy,
efficiency, and deployability, making it highly suitable for intelligent,
closed-loop bioprinting systems.

Conclusion: STAGE通过创新的异常推理策略和分级扩散框架，成功解决了工业异常合成中的关键挑战，为下游异常分割任务提供了更高质量的合成数据。

Abstract: Segmentation-oriented Industrial Anomaly Synthesis (SIAS) plays a pivotal
role in enhancing the performance of downstream anomaly segmentation, as it
provides an effective means of expanding abnormal data. However, existing SIAS
methods face several critical limitations: (i) the synthesized anomalies often
lack intricate texture details and fail to align precisely with the surrounding
background, and (ii) they struggle to generate fine-grained, pixel-level
anomalies. To address these challenges, we propose Segmentation-oriented
Anomaly synthesis via Graded diffusion with Explicit mask alignment, termed
STAGE. STAGE introduces a novel anomaly inference strategy that incorporates
clean background information as a prior to guide the denoising distribution,
enabling the model to more effectively distinguish and highlight abnormal
foregrounds. Furthermore, it employs a graded diffusion framework with an
anomaly-only branch to explicitly record local anomalies during both the
forward and reverse processes, ensuring that subtle anomalies are not
overlooked. Finally, STAGE incorporates the explicit mask alignment (EMA)
strategy to progressively align the synthesized anomalies with the background,
resulting in context-consistent and structurally coherent generations.
Extensive experiments on the MVTec and BTAD datasets demonstrate that STAGE
achieves state-of-the-art performance in SIAS, which in turn enhances
downstream anomaly segmentation.

joint 3D skeleton geometry and topology synthesis from single 2D images. Our
architecture introduces three key innovations: (1) A hierarchical graph
attention mechanism with multi-scale skeletal refinement, (2) Differentiable
spectral topology optimization via Laplacian eigen decomposition, and (3)
Adversarial geometric consistency training for pose structure alignment. The
framework integrates four synergistic modules: a pseudo 3D point cloud
generator, an enhanced PointNet encoder, a skeleton coordinate decoder, and a
novel Differentiable Graph Construction Network (DGCN). Our experiments
demonstrate state-of-the-art results with 18.7 percent improvement in MPJPE and
27.3 percent in Graph Edit Distance on ShapeNet, while reducing topological
errors by 42 percent compared to previous approaches. The model's end-to-end
differentiability enables applications in robotic manipulation, medical
imaging, and automated character rigging.

Abstract: Brain tumors are serious health problems that require early diagnosis due to
their high mortality rates. Diagnosing tumors by examining Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) images is a process that requires expertise and is prone to
error. Therefore, the need for automated diagnosis systems is increasing day by
day. In this context, a robust and explainable Deep Learning (DL) model for the
classification of brain tumors is proposed. In this study, a publicly available
Figshare dataset containing 3,064 T1-weighted contrast-enhanced brain MRI
images of three tumor types was used. First, the classification performance of
nine well-known CNN architectures was evaluated to determine the most effective
backbone. Among these, EfficientNetV2 demonstrated the best performance and was
selected as the backbone for further development. Subsequently, an
attention-based MLP-Mixer architecture was integrated into EfficientNetV2 to
enhance its classification capability. The performance of the final model was
comprehensively compared with basic CNNs and the methods in the literature.
Additionally, Grad-CAM visualization was used to interpret and validate the
decision-making process of the proposed model. The proposed model's performance
was evaluated using the five-fold cross-validation method. The proposed model
demonstrated superior performance with 99.50% accuracy, 99.47% precision,
99.52% recall and 99.49% F1 score. The results obtained show that the model
outperforms the studies in the literature. Moreover, Grad-CAM visualizations
demonstrate that the model effectively focuses on relevant regions of MRI
images, thus improving interpretability and clinical reliability. A robust deep
learning model for clinical decision support systems has been obtained by
combining EfficientNetV2 and attention-based MLP-Mixer, providing high accuracy
and interpretability in brain tumor classification.

TL;DR: Zo3T是一个零样本测试时训练框架，通过3D感知运动投影、轨迹引导的测试时LoRA适配器和引导场校正，实现了高质量的轨迹引导图像到视频生成，无需大量标注数据和微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有轨迹引导图像到视频生成方法需要大量计算资源进行微调，以及零样本方法在潜在空间操作时忽略3D透视导致运动不真实、潜在空间与噪声预测不对齐的问题。

Method: 1) 3D感知运动投影：利用场景深度推断进行透视校正的仿射变换；2) 轨迹引导测试时LoRA：动态注入和优化临时LoRA适配器，通过区域特征一致性损失实现运动约束；3) 引导场校正：通过一步前瞻策略优化条件引导场，确保高效生成过程。

Conclusion: Zo3T框架通过创新的测试时训练机制，成功解决了轨迹引导视频生成中的3D真实性和运动准确性问题，为无需大量标注数据的视频生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Trajectory-Guided image-to-video (I2V) generation aims to synthesize videos
that adhere to user-specified motion instructions. Existing methods typically
rely on computationally expensive fine-tuning on scarce annotated datasets.
Although some zero-shot methods attempt to trajectory control in the latent
space, they may yield unrealistic motion by neglecting 3D perspective and
creating a misalignment between the manipulated latents and the network's noise
predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce Zo3T, a novel zero-shot
test-time-training framework for trajectory-guided generation with three core
innovations: First, we incorporate a 3D-Aware Kinematic Projection, leveraging
inferring scene depth to derive perspective-correct affine transformations for
target regions. Second, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Test-Time LoRA, a
mechanism that dynamically injects and optimizes ephemeral LoRA adapters into
the denoising network alongside the latent state. Driven by a regional feature
consistency loss, this co-adaptation effectively enforces motion constraints
while allowing the pre-trained model to locally adapt its internal
representations to the manipulated latent, thereby ensuring generative fidelity
and on-manifold adherence. Finally, we develop Guidance Field Rectification,
which refines the denoising evolutionary path by optimizing the conditional
guidance field through a one-step lookahead strategy, ensuring efficient
generative progression towards the target trajectory. Zo3T significantly
enhances 3D realism and motion accuracy in trajectory-controlled I2V
generation, demonstrating superior performance over existing training-based and
zero-shot approaches.

Motivation: 现有研究分别处理组织语义分割和细胞核实例分割，忽略了这两个任务之间的内在联系，导致对病理图像的理解不足。

Method: 提出Co-Seg框架：1）区域感知提示编码器（RP-Encoder）提供高质量的语义和实例区域提示作为先验约束；2）互提示掩码解码器（MP-Decoder）利用交叉引导增强两个任务的上下文一致性，协同计算语义和实例分割掩码。

Result: 在PUMA数据集上的大量实验表明，Co-Seg在肿瘤组织和细胞核实例的语义、实例和全景分割方面均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 通过协同分割框架有效利用了组织分割和细胞核分割任务之间的内在关系，实现了相互增强，显著提升了病理图像分析性能。

Abstract: Histopathology image analysis is critical yet challenged by the demand of
segmenting tissue regions and nuclei instances for tumor microenvironment and
cellular morphology analysis. Existing studies focused on tissue semantic
segmentation or nuclei instance segmentation separately, but ignored the
inherent relationship between these two tasks, resulting in insufficient
histopathology understanding. To address this issue, we propose a Co-Seg
framework for collaborative tissue and nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we
introduce a novel co-segmentation paradigm, allowing tissue and nuclei
segmentation tasks to mutually enhance each other. To this end, we first devise
a region-aware prompt encoder (RP-Encoder) to provide high-quality semantic and
instance region prompts as prior constraints. Moreover, we design a mutual
prompt mask decoder (MP-Decoder) that leverages cross-guidance to strengthen
the contextual consistency of both tasks, collaboratively computing semantic
and instance segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on the PUMA dataset
demonstrate that the proposed Co-Seg surpasses state-of-the-arts in the
semantic, instance and panoptic segmentation of tumor tissues and nuclei
instances. The source code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/Co-Seg.

Abstract: Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in forest
environments for tasks such as environmental monitoring and search and rescue,
which require safe navigation through dense foliage and precise data
collection. Traditional sensing approaches, including passive multispectral and
RGB imaging, suffer from latency, poor depth resolution, and strong dependence
on ambient light - especially under forest canopies. In this work, we present a
novel event spectroscopy system that simultaneously enables high-resolution,
low-latency depth reconstruction and multispectral imaging using a single
sensor. Depth is reconstructed using structured light, and by modulating the
wavelength of the projected structured light, our system captures spectral
information in controlled bands between 650 nm and 850 nm. We demonstrate up to
$60\%$ improvement in RMSE over commercial depth sensors and validate the
spectral accuracy against a reference spectrometer and commercial multispectral
cameras, demonstrating comparable performance. A portable version limited to
RGB (3 wavelengths) is used to collect real-world depth and spectral data from
a Masoala Rainforest. We demonstrate the use of this prototype for color image
reconstruction and material differentiation between leaves and branches using
spectral and depth data. Our results show that adding depth (available at no
extra effort with our setup) to material differentiation improves the accuracy
by over $30\%$ compared to color-only method. Our system, tested in both lab
and real-world rainforest environments, shows strong performance in depth
estimation, RGB reconstruction, and material differentiation - paving the way
for lightweight, integrated, and robust UAV perception and data collection in
complex natural environments.

Abstract: With the rapid development of computer vision and machine learning, automated
methods for pothole detection and recognition based on image and video data
have received significant attention. It is of great significance for social
development to conduct an in-depth analysis of road images through feature
extraction, thereby achieving automatic identification of the pothole condition

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机虽然具有高时间分辨率、低延迟和高动态范围等优势，但成本高、分辨率有限且缺乏自动对焦等功能，限制了其在早期开发和原型设计中的广泛应用。

Method: 通过直接访问原始Bayer数据并绕过传统图像信号处理器(ISP)，基于DVS-Voltmeter模型构建可配置的仿真框架，设计支持原始数据、RGB和事件流同步记录的数据采集管道。

Result: 实验结果显示Raw2Event生成的事件流与真实事件相机非常相似，同时受益于更高分辨率和自动对焦能力，支持用户直观参数调整，并在树莓派上实现实时操作。

Conclusion: 该系统为基于事件的视觉研究和早期系统开发提供了可扩展且经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Event cameras offer unique advantages such as high temporal resolution, low
latency, and high dynamic range, making them more and more popular for vision
tasks under challenging light conditions. However, their high cost, limited
resolution, and lack of features such as autofocus hinder their broad adoption,
particularly for early-stage development and prototyping. In this work, we
present Raw2Event, a complete hardware-software system that enables real-time
event generation from low-cost raw frame-based cameras. By leveraging direct
access to raw Bayer data and bypassing traditional image signal processors
(ISP), our system is able to utilize the full potential of camera hardware,
delivering higher dynamic range, higher resolution, and more faithful output
than RGB-based frame-to-event converters.
  Built upon the DVS-Voltmeter model, Raw2Event features a configurable
simulation framework optimized for deployment on embedded platforms. We further
design a data acquisition pipeline that supports synchronized recording of raw,
RGB, and event streams, facilitating downstream evaluation and dataset
creation. Experimental results show that Raw2Event can generate event streams
closely resembling those from real event cameras, while benefiting from higher
resolution and autofocus capabilities. The system also supports user-intuitive
parameter tuning, enabling flexible adaptation to various application
requirements. Finally, we deploy the system on a Raspberry Pi for real-time
operation, providing a scalable and cost-effective solution for event-based
vision research and early-stage system development.

Abstract: Dark humor in online memes poses unique challenges due to its reliance on
implicit, sensitive, and culturally contextual cues. To address the lack of
resources and methods for detecting dark humor in multimodal content, we
introduce a novel dataset of 4,379 Reddit memes annotated for dark humor,
target category (gender, mental health, violence, race, disability, and other),
and a three-level intensity rating (mild, moderate, severe). Building on this
resource, we propose a reasoning-augmented framework that first generates
structured explanations for each meme using a Large Vision-Language Model
(VLM). Through a Role-Reversal Self-Loop, VLM adopts the author's perspective
to iteratively refine its explanations, ensuring completeness and alignment. We
then extract textual features from both the OCR transcript and the self-refined
reasoning via a text encoder, while visual features are obtained using a vision
transformer. A Tri-stream Cross-Reasoning Network (TCRNet) fuses these three
streams, text, image, and reasoning, via pairwise attention mechanisms,
producing a unified representation for classification. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong baselines across three tasks:
dark humor detection, target identification, and intensity prediction. The
dataset, annotations, and code are released to facilitate further research in
multimodal humor understanding and content moderation. Code and Dataset are

Abstract: This article presents UrbanTwin datasets - high-fidelity, realistic replicas
of three public roadside lidar datasets: LUMPI, V2X-Real-IC, and TUMTraf-I.
Each UrbanTwin dataset contains 10K annotated frames corresponding to one of
the public datasets. Annotations include 3D bounding boxes, instance
segmentation labels, and tracking IDs for six object classes, along with
semantic segmentation labels for nine classes. These datasets are synthesized
using emulated lidar sensors within realistic digital twins, modeled based on
surrounding geometry, road alignment at lane level, and the lane topology and
vehicle movement patterns at intersections of the actual locations
corresponding to each real dataset. Due to the precise digital twin modeling,
the synthetic datasets are well aligned with their real counterparts, offering
strong standalone and augmentative value for training deep learning models on
tasks such as 3D object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance
segmentation. We evaluate the alignment of the synthetic replicas through
statistical and structural similarity analysis with real data, and further
demonstrate their utility by training 3D object detection models solely on
synthetic data and testing them on real, unseen data. The high similarity
scores and improved detection performance, compared to the models trained on
real data, indicate that the UrbanTwin datasets effectively enhance existing
benchmark datasets by increasing sample size and scene diversity. In addition,
the digital twins can be adapted to test custom scenarios by modifying the
design and dynamics of the simulations. To our knowledge, these are the first
digitally synthesized datasets that can replace in-domain real-world datasets
for lidar perception tasks. UrbanTwin datasets are publicly available at

Abstract: Segmenting 3D assets into their constituent parts is crucial for enhancing 3D
understanding, facilitating model reuse, and supporting various applications
such as part generation. However, current methods face limitations such as poor
robustness when dealing with complex objects and cannot fully automate the
process. In this paper, we propose a native 3D point-promptable part
segmentation model termed P3-SAM, designed to fully automate the segmentation
of any 3D objects into components. Inspired by SAM, P3-SAM consists of a
feature extractor, multiple segmentation heads, and an IoU predictor, enabling
interactive segmentation for users. We also propose an algorithm to
automatically select and merge masks predicted by our model for part instance
segmentation. Our model is trained on a newly built dataset containing nearly
3.7 million models with reasonable segmentation labels. Comparisons show that
our method achieves precise segmentation results and strong robustness on any
complex objects, attaining state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be
released soon.

Abstract: In the field of autonomous driving, sensor simulation is essential for
generating rare and diverse scenarios that are difficult to capture in
real-world environments. Current solutions fall into two categories: 1)
CG-based methods, such as CARLA, which lack diversity and struggle to scale to
the vast array of rare cases required for robust perception training; and 2)
learning-based approaches, such as NeuSim, which are limited to specific object
categories (vehicles) and require extensive multi-sensor data, hindering their
applicability to generic objects. To address these limitations, we propose a
scalable real2sim2real system that leverages 3D generation to automate asset
mining, generation, and rare-case data synthesis.

video frame interpolation and optical flow estimation. VAR-MIORe further
extends by spanning a variable range of motion magnitudes, from minimal to
extreme, establishing the first benchmark to offer explicit control over motion
amplitude. We provide high-resolution, scalable ground truths that challenge
existing algorithms under both controlled and adverse conditions, paving the

Result: 大量实验表明UMO显著提高了身份一致性，减少了身份混淆，在身份保持维度上达到了开源方法的新state-of-the-art水平。

Conclusion: UMO有效解决了多身份图像定制中的身份一致性和混淆问题，为图像定制方法提供了可扩展的身份保持解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in image customization exhibit a wide range of
application prospects due to stronger customization capabilities. However,
since we humans are more sensitive to faces, a significant challenge remains in
preserving consistent identity while avoiding identity confusion with
multi-reference images, limiting the identity scalability of customization
models. To address this, we present UMO, a Unified Multi-identity Optimization
framework, designed to maintain high-fidelity identity preservation and
alleviate identity confusion with scalability. With "multi-to-multi matching"
paradigm, UMO reformulates multi-identity generation as a global assignment
optimization problem and unleashes multi-identity consistency for existing
image customization methods generally through reinforcement learning on
diffusion models. To facilitate the training of UMO, we develop a scalable
customization dataset with multi-reference images, consisting of both
synthesised and real parts. Additionally, we propose a new metric to measure
identity confusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMO not only
improves identity consistency significantly, but also reduces identity
confusion on several image customization methods, setting a new
state-of-the-art among open-source methods along the dimension of identity
preserving. Code and model: https://github.com/bytedance/UMO

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于对比学习的视频年龄分级分类方法，结合CNN+LSTM和注意力机制，在Contextual Contrastive Learning框架下达到88%准确率，并部署为实时分类Web应用


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频年龄分级方法需要大量标注数据、泛化能力差且特征学习效率低，无法满足流媒体平台对内容合规性的自动化需求

Method: 使用三种对比学习框架（实例判别、上下文对比、多视图对比），采用LRCN（CNN+LSTM）主干网络结合Bahdanau注意力机制，评估多种对比损失函数

Result: Contextual Contrastive Learning框架表现最佳，达到88%准确率和0.8815 F1分数，能有效区分PG-13和R级等边界案例

Conclusion: 对比学习结合时空建模和注意力机制能显著提升视频年龄分级性能，所提架构具有鲁棒性且已部署为实用Web应用

Abstract: The rapid growth of visual content consumption across platforms necessitates
automated video classification for age-suitability standards like the MPAA
rating system (G, PG, PG-13, R). Traditional methods struggle with large
labeled data requirements, poor generalization, and inefficient feature
learning. To address these challenges, we employ contrastive learning for
improved discrimination and adaptability, exploring three frameworks: Instance
Discrimination, Contextual Contrastive Learning, and Multi-View Contrastive
Learning. Our hybrid architecture integrates an LRCN (CNN+LSTM) backbone with a
Bahdanau attention mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the
Contextual Contrastive Learning framework, with 88% accuracy and an F1 score of
0.8815. By combining CNNs for spatial features, LSTMs for temporal modeling,
and attention mechanisms for dynamic frame prioritization, the model excels in
fine-grained borderline distinctions, such as differentiating PG-13 and R-rated
content. We evaluate the model's performance across various contrastive loss
functions, including NT-Xent, NT-logistic, and Margin Triplet, demonstrating
the robustness of our proposed architecture. To ensure practical application,
the model is deployed as a web application for real-time MPAA rating
classification, offering an efficient solution for automated content compliance
across streaming platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI辅助放射学诊断主要基于单一任务的窄模型，无法覆盖广泛的成像模态、疾病和放射学发现。基础模型在放射学领域的潜力尚未充分实现

Method: 基于一家大型医院多年全部横断面成像输出数据（15万次检查，130TB）训练基础模型Curia，并在新构建的19任务外部验证基准上进行评估

Result: Curia能准确识别器官、检测脑出血和心肌梗死等病症、预测肿瘤分期结果，在跨模态和少数据场景下表现出临床显著的涌现特性

Conclusion: Curia证明了基础模型在放射学中的巨大潜力，为加速该领域发展，作者在Hugging Face上发布了模型权重

Abstract: AI-assisted radiological interpretation is based on predominantly narrow,
single-task models. This approach is impractical for covering the vast spectrum
of imaging modalities, diseases, and radiological findings. Foundation models
(FMs) hold the promise of broad generalization across modalities and in
low-data settings. However, this potential has remained largely unrealized in
radiology. We introduce Curia, a foundation model trained on the entire
cross-sectional imaging output of a major hospital over several years, which to
our knowledge is the largest such corpus of real-world data-encompassing
150,000 exams (130 TB). On a newly curated 19-task external validation
benchmark, Curia accurately identifies organs, detects conditions like brain
hemorrhages and myocardial infarctions, and predicts outcomes in tumor staging.
Curia meets or surpasses the performance of radiologists and recent foundation
models, and exhibits clinically significant emergent properties in
cross-modality, and low-data regimes. To accelerate progress, we release our
base model's weights at https://huggingface.co/raidium/curia.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了如何通过过度学习调整通用基础模型V-JEPA和整合多模态手术室数据来支持多任务外科数据科学应用。实验结果显示域适配和多模态数据集成都能提升模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何利用通用基础模型通过过度学习和多模态数据集成来支持多任务外科数据科学应用，以提升手术决策支持能力。

Method: 使用V-JEPA作为单模态基础模型，通过在未标注的外科视频数据上进行过度学习来调整模型，并整合手术室的其他时间分辨数据流构建多模态模型。在内部肝脏手术数据集上评估医院住院时间和手术后并发症预测，在公开HeiCo数据集上评估手术时相识别任务。

Result: 域适配调整显著提升了模型性能。在内部数据上，整合额外的时间分辨数据流同样有益。在HeiCo数据集上，单模态基线模型的准确率已等同于EndoVis2017挑战赛的最佳提交结果，域适配后进一步提升了准确率。

Conclusion: 研究结果证明外科数据科学可以利用公开的通用基础模型，通过域适配和整合适宜的补充数据流来提升模型性能，为手术决策支持系统的发展提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: We investigate how both the adaptation of a generic foundation model via
transfer learning and the integration of complementary modalities from the
operating room (OR) can support surgical data science. To this end, we use
V-JEPA as the single-modality foundation of a multimodal model for minimally
invasive surgery support. We analyze how the model's downstream performance can
benefit (a) from finetuning on unlabeled surgical video data and (b) from
providing additional time-resolved data streams from the OR in a multimodal
setup.
  In an in-house dataset of liver surgery videos, we analyze the tasks of
predicting hospital length of stay and postoperative complications. In videos
of the public HeiCo dataset, we analyze the task of surgical phase recognition.
As a baseline, we apply pretrained V-JEPA to all tasks. We then finetune it on
unlabeled, held-out videos to investigate its change in performance after
domain adaptation. Following the idea of modular decision support networks, we
integrate additional data streams from the OR by training a separate encoder to
form a shared representation space with V-JEPA's embeddings.
  Our experiments show that finetuning on domain-specific data increases model
performance. On the in-house data, integrating additional time-resolved data
likewise benefits the model. On the HeiCo data, accuracy of the pretrained
video-only, single-modality baseline setup is on par with the top-performing
submissions of the EndoVis2017 challenge, while finetuning on domain-specific
data increases accuracy further. Our results thus demonstrate how surgical data
science can leverage public, generic foundation models. Likewise, they indicate
the potential of domain adaptation and of integrating suitable complementary
data streams from the OR. To support further research, we release our code and
model weights at https://github.com/DigitalSurgeryLab-Basel/ML-CDS-2025.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动评估粗糖兰病严重程度耗时且主观性强，存在观察者间和观察者内变异性，需要自动化解决方案来提高效率和准确性。

Method: 发展ARTSS框架，包含四个步骤：图像预处理和重定向(ResNet50)、手部分割(UNet.3)、关节识别(YOLOv7)、TSS预测(多种深度学习模型)。使用970名患者数据，采用3折交叉验证和外部测试。

Conclusion: 深度学习可以有效自动化RA评分过程，提高临床工作效率，减少主观性差异，并为风湿病学家提供更准确的诊断支持。

Abstract: Assessing the severity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using the Total Sharp/Van
Der Heijde Score (TSS) is crucial, but manual scoring is often time-consuming
and subjective. This study introduces an Automated Radiographic Sharp Scoring
(ARTSS) framework that leverages deep learning to analyze full-hand X-ray
images, aiming to reduce inter- and intra-observer variability. The research
uniquely accommodates patients with joint disappearance and variable-length
image sequences. We developed ARTSS using data from 970 patients, structured
into four stages: I) Image pre-processing and re-orientation using ResNet50,
II) Hand segmentation using UNet.3, III) Joint identification using YOLOv7, and
IV) TSS prediction using models such as VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, DenseNet201,
EfficientNetB0, and Vision Transformer (ViT). We evaluated model performance
with Intersection over Union (IoU), Mean Average Precision (MAP), mean absolute
error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Huber loss. The average TSS
from two radiologists was used as the ground truth. Model training employed
3-fold cross-validation, with each fold consisting of 452 training and 227
validation samples, and external testing included 291 unseen subjects. Our
joint identification model achieved 99% accuracy. The best-performing model,
ViT, achieved a notably low Huber loss of 0.87 for TSS prediction. Our results
demonstrate the potential of deep learning to automate RA scoring, which can
significantly enhance clinical practice. Our approach addresses the challenge
of joint disappearance and variable joint numbers, offers timesaving benefits,
reduces inter- and intra-reader variability, improves radiologist accuracy, and
aids rheumatologists in making more informed decisions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种拓扑自适应的变形模型来处理包含拓扑伪影的非刚性3D网格匹配问题，能够在ARAP和双射关联约束下对齐形状对，无需数据驱动先验即可处理高度非等距形状和拓扑伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实场景中（如多视角重建）存在的拓扑伪影问题，这些伪影会破坏现有方法基于等距变形或ARAP变形的假设。

Method: 提出拓扑自适应变形模型，联合优化具有适当拓扑的模板网格及其与待匹配形状的对齐，在ARAP和双射关联约束下提取对应关系。

Result: 方法适用于高度非等距形状和包含拓扑伪影的形状，包括噪声多视角重建，在3D对齐质量上甚至优于基于大数据训练的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法不依赖数据驱动先验，能够有效处理拓扑变化和伪影，在复杂拓扑配置下实现了优异的网格匹配性能。

Abstract: Non-rigid 3D mesh matching is a critical step in computer vision and computer
graphics pipelines. We tackle matching meshes that contain topological
artefacts which can break the assumption made by current approaches. While
Functional Maps assume the deformation induced by the ground truth
correspondences to be near-isometric, ARAP-like deformation-guided approaches
assume the latter to be ARAP. Neither assumption holds in certain topological
configurations of the input shapes. We are motivated by real-world scenarios
such as per-frame multi-view reconstructions, often suffering from topological
artefacts. To this end, we propose a topology-adaptive deformation model
allowing changes in shape topology to align shape pairs under ARAP and
bijective association constraints. Using this model, we jointly optimise for a
template mesh with adequate topology and for its alignment with the shapes to
be matched to extract correspondences. We show that, while not relying on any
data-driven prior, our approach applies to highly non-isometric shapes and
shapes with topological artefacts, including noisy per-frame multi-view
reconstructions, even outperforming methods trained on large datasets in 3D
alignment quality.

Motivation: 自动车牌识别在智慧城市中至关重要，但高变化性和模糊图像带来挑战，需要更有效的深度学习方案来提升识别准确性。

Method: 使用选择性GAN进行去模糊预处理，结合YOLOv5对象检测架构进行车牌检测、字符分割和字符识别，避免不必要的输入操作。

Conclusion: 结合YOLOv5和Deblur-GAN的方案能够在保持实时性能的同时提高识别准确性，特别是对模糊车牌图像，适合移动应用场景。

Abstract: Automatic License-Plate Recognition (ALPR) plays a pivotal role in
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) as a fundamental element of Smart
Cities. However, due to its high variability, ALPR faces challenging issues
more efficiently addressed by deep learning techniques. In this paper, a
selective Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is proposed for deblurring in
the preprocessing step, coupled with the state-of-the-art You-Only-Look-Once
(YOLO)v5 object detection architectures for License-Plate Detection (LPD), and
the integrated Character Segmentation (CS) and Character Recognition (CR)
steps. The selective preprocessing bypasses unnecessary and sometimes
counter-productive input manipulations, while YOLOv5 LPD/CS+CR delivers high
accuracy and low computing cost. As a result, YOLOv5 achieves a detection time
of 0.026 seconds for both LP and CR detection stages, facilitating real-time
applications with exceptionally rapid responsiveness. Moreover, the proposed
model achieves accuracy rates of 95\% and 97\% in the LPD and CR detection
phases, respectively. Furthermore, the inclusion of the Deblur-GAN
pre-processor significantly improves detection accuracy by nearly 40\%,
especially when encountering blurred License Plates (LPs).To train and test the
learning components, we generated and publicly released our blur and ALPR
datasets (using Iranian license plates as a use-case), which are more
representative of close-to-real-life ad-hoc situations. The findings
demonstrate that employing the state-of-the-art YOLO model results in excellent
overall precision and detection time, making it well-suited for portable
applications. Additionally, integrating the Deblur-GAN model as a preliminary
processing step enhances the overall effectiveness of our comprehensive model,
particularly when confronted with blurred scenes captured by the camera as
input.

Result: 在二值分割引擎任务上达到竞争性的准确度，同时参数数量大幅减少且推理速度更快。

Conclusion: 该模型为实时和资源受限的临床部署提供了实用的替代方案，并开源了代码。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in clinical workflows,
particularly for the detection and delineation of pathological regions. While
convolutional architectures like U-Net have become standard for such tasks,
their limited receptive field restricts global context modeling. Recent efforts
integrating transformers have addressed this, but often result in deep,
computationally expensive models unsuitable for real-time use. In this work, we
present a novel end-to-end lightweight architecture designed specifically for
real-time binary medical image segmentation. Our model combines a Swin
Transformer-like encoder with a U-Net-like decoder, connected via skip pathways
to preserve spatial detail while capturing contextual information. Unlike
existing designs such as Swin Transformer or U-Net, our architecture is
significantly shallower and competitively efficient. To improve the encoder's
ability to learn meaningful features without relying on large amounts of
labeled data, we first train it using Barlow Twins, a self-supervised learning
method that helps the model focus on important patterns by reducing unnecessary
repetition in the learned features. After this pretraining, we fine-tune the
entire model for our specific task. Experiments on benchmark binary
segmentation tasks demonstrate that our model achieves competitive accuracy
with substantially reduced parameter count and faster inference, positioning it
as a practical alternative for deployment in real-time and resource-limited
clinical environments. The code for our method is available at Github
repository: https://github.com/mkianih/Barlow-Swin.

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上实验显示，在患者特定和非特定场景下均获得更优的配准精度

Conclusion: 非欧几里得球面特征空间的相似性学习方法能更好地捕捉复杂流形结构，提高配准性能

Abstract: Intraoperative 2D/3D registration aligns preoperative 3D volumes with
real-time 2D radiographs, enabling accurate localization of instruments and
implants. A recent fully differentiable similarity learning framework
approximates geodesic distances on SE(3), expanding the capture range of
registration and mitigating the effects of substantial disturbances, but
existing Euclidean approximations distort manifold structure and slow
convergence. To address these limitations, we explore similarity learning in
non-Euclidean spherical feature spaces to better capture and fit complex
manifold structure. We extract feature embeddings using a CNN-Transformer
encoder, project them into spherical space, and approximate their geodesic
distances with Riemannian distances in the bi-invariant SO(4) space. This
enables a more expressive and geometrically consistent deep similarity metric,
enhancing the ability to distinguish subtle pose differences. During inference,
we replace gradient descent with fully differentiable Levenberg-Marquardt
optimization to accelerate convergence. Experiments on real and synthetic
datasets show superior accuracy in both patient-specific and patient-agnostic
scenarios.

Abstract: This paper introduces BIR-Adapter, a low-complexity blind image restoration
adapter for diffusion models. The BIR-Adapter enables the utilization of the
prior of pre-trained large-scale diffusion models on blind image restoration
without training any auxiliary feature extractor. We take advantage of the
robustness of pretrained models. We extract features from degraded images via
the model itself and extend the self-attention mechanism with these degraded
features. We introduce a sampling guidance mechanism to reduce hallucinations.
We perform experiments on synthetic and real-world degradations and demonstrate
that BIR-Adapter achieves competitive or better performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while having significantly lower complexity.
Additionally, its adapter-based design enables integration into other diffusion
models, enabling broader applications in image restoration tasks. We showcase
this by extending a super-resolution-only model to perform better under
additional unknown degradations.

Abstract: Vision-driven field monitoring is central to digital agriculture, yet models
built on general-domain pretrained backbones often fail to generalize across
tasks, owing to the interaction of fine, variable canopy structures with
fluctuating field conditions. We present FoMo4Wheat, one of the first
crop-domain vision foundation model pretrained with self-supervision on
ImAg4Wheat, the largest and most diverse wheat image dataset to date (2.5
million high-resolution images collected over a decade at 30 global sites,
spanning >2,000 genotypes and >500 environmental conditions). This
wheat-specific pretraining yields representations that are robust for wheat and
transferable to other crops and weeds. Across ten in-field vision tasks at
canopy and organ levels, FoMo4Wheat models consistently outperform
state-of-the-art models pretrained on general-domain dataset. These results
demonstrate the value of crop-specific foundation models for reliable in-field
perception and chart a path toward a universal crop foundation model with
cross-species and cross-task capabilities. FoMo4Wheat models and the ImAg4Wheat

Abstract: Transformers have been successfully applied in the field of video-based 3D
human pose estimation. However, the high computational costs of these video
pose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices.
In this paper, we present a hierarchical plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering
framework, called Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer (H$_{2}$OT), for efficient
transformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. H$_{2}$OT begins with
progressively pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering
full-length sequences, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate
transformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. It works with two
key modules, namely, a Token Pruning Module (TPM) and a Token Recovering Module
(TRM). TPM dynamically selects a few representative tokens to eliminate the
redundancy of video frames, while TRM restores the detailed spatio-temporal
information based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output
to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Our method
is general-purpose: it can be easily incorporated into common VPT models on
both seq2seq and seq2frame pipelines while effectively accommodating different
token pruning and recovery strategies. In addition, our H$_{2}$OT reveals that
maintaining the full pose sequence is unnecessary, and a few pose tokens of
representative frames can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate both the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Code and models are
