### [1] [Specification Self-Correction: Mitigating In-Context Reward Hacking Through Test-Time Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18742)
*Víctor Gallego*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Specification Self-Correction (SSC)的新框架，用于解决语言模型在上下文奖励中的漏洞利用问题，通过自我修正规范来提升模型行为的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型容易利用有缺陷的规范或评分标准（即奖励黑客行为）来获得高分，而忽视了用户的真实意图。

Method: SSC框架通过多步推理过程，让模型首先生成基于潜在缺陷规范的响应，然后自我批评并修正规范，最终生成更鲁棒的响应。

Result: 实验表明，SSC能将模型利用缺陷规范的漏洞比例从50-70%降低90%以上，且无需修改模型权重。

Conclusion: SSC在推理时动态修复规范漏洞，显著提升了语言模型的行为对齐性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are susceptible to in-context reward hacking, where
they exploit flaws in tainted or faulty written specifications or rubrics to
achieve high scores without fulfilling the user's true intent. We introduce
Specification Self-Correction (SSC), a novel, test-time framework that enables
an LM to identify and correct flaws within its own guiding specification. SSC
employs a multi-step inference process where the model first generates a
response based on a potentially tainted specification, critiques its output,
and then revises the specification itself to remove the exploitable loophole. A
final, more robust response is then generated using this self-corrected
specification. Across experiments spanning creative writing and agentic coding
tasks with several LMs, we demonstrate that while models initially game tainted
specifications in 50-70\% of cases, the SSC process reduces this vulnerability
by over 90\%. This dynamic repair occurs at inference time, requires no weight
modification, and leads to more robustly aligned model behavior. Code at

### [2] [The Role of Orthographic Consistency in Multilingual Embedding Models for Text Classification in Arabic-Script Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18762)
*Abdulhady Abas Abdullah,Amir H. Gandomi,Tarik A Rashid,Seyedali Mirjalili,Laith Abualigah,Milena Živković,Hadi Veisi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AS-RoBERTa系列模型针对阿拉伯文字语言优化，通过语言特定的预训练，在分类任务中表现优于通用多语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言模型在共享文字但语言特性不同的阿拉伯文字语言（如库尔德语、阿拉伯语、波斯语、乌尔都语）中表现不佳的问题。

Method: 开发了四种基于RoBERTa的AS-RoBERTa模型，每种模型针对特定语言进行预训练，专注于文字特征和统计信息。

Result: AS-RoBERTa在分类任务中比mBERT和XLM-RoBERTa表现更好，提升2-5个百分点。消融实验证实了文字专注预训练的重要性。

Conclusion: 针对阿拉伯文字的语言特定预训练策略有效，支持进一步研究基于文字和语言特性的预训练方法。

Abstract: In natural language processing, multilingual models like mBERT and
XLM-RoBERTa promise broad coverage but often struggle with languages that share
a script yet differ in orthographic norms and cultural context. This issue is
especially notable in Arabic-script languages such as Kurdish Sorani, Arabic,
Persian, and Urdu. We introduce the Arabic Script RoBERTa (AS-RoBERTa) family:
four RoBERTa-based models, each pre-trained on a large corpus tailored to its
specific language. By focusing pre-training on language-specific script
features and statistics, our models capture patterns overlooked by
general-purpose models. When fine-tuned on classification tasks, AS-RoBERTa
variants outperform mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa by 2 to 5 percentage points. An
ablation study confirms that script-focused pre-training is central to these
gains. Error analysis using confusion matrices shows how shared script traits
and domain-specific content affect performance. Our results highlight the value
of script-aware specialization for languages using the Arabic script and
support further work on pre-training strategies rooted in script and language
specificity.

### [3] [ylmmcl at Multilingual Text Detoxification 2025: Lexicon-Guided Detoxification and Classifier-Gated Rewriting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18769)
*Nicole Lai-Lopez,Lusha Wang,Su Yuan,Liza Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种多语言文本去毒解决方案，结合词典引导标注、微调的序列到序列模型和迭代分类器门控机制，在PAN-2025竞赛中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言文本去毒任务，提升去毒精度和跨语言泛化能力。

Method: 整合词典引导标注、微调的序列到序列模型和迭代分类器门控机制。

Result: 在开发集和测试集上取得高STA（0.922）和J分数（0.612），xCOMET分数分别为0.793和0.787。

Conclusion: 模型在多语言环境中表现优异，尤其在英语、俄语和法语中泛化能力强，但需权衡SIM指标。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce our solution for the Multilingual Text
Detoxification Task in the PAN-2025 competition for the ylmmcl team: a robust
multilingual text detoxification pipeline that integrates lexicon-guided
tagging, a fine-tuned sequence-to-sequence model (s-nlp/mt0-xl-detox-orpo) and
an iterative classifier-based gatekeeping mechanism. Our approach departs from
prior unsupervised or monolingual pipelines by leveraging explicit toxic word
annotation via the multilingual_toxic_lexicon to guide detoxification with
greater precision and cross-lingual generalization. Our final model achieves
the highest STA (0.922) from our previous attempts, and an average official J
score of 0.612 for toxic inputs in both the development and test sets. It also
achieved xCOMET scores of 0.793 (dev) and 0.787 (test). This performance
outperforms baseline and backtranslation methods across multiple languages, and
shows strong generalization in high-resource settings (English, Russian,
French). Despite some trade-offs in SIM, the model demonstrates consistent
improvements in detoxification strength. In the competition, our team achieved
ninth place with a score of 0.612.

### [4] [Evaluating Code-Mixing in LLMs Across 18 Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18791)
*Yilun Yang,Yekun Chai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了代码混合（code-mixing）对自然语言处理的挑战，分析了现有基准的局限性，并提出了一种新的合成代码混合文本的方法。研究发现LLMs在多语言家族代码混合数据上表现不佳，并提出了改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码混合在自然语言处理中具有独特挑战，但现有基准和LLMs研究有限，且缺乏有效的数据生成方法。

Method: 对18种语言的代码混合数据进行了全面评估，并提出了一种结合单词替换和GPT-4提示的合成代码混合文本方法。

Result: LLMs在多语言家族代码混合数据上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 建议通过增加训练数据规模、模型规模和少样本学习来提升LLMs在代码混合任务中的表现。

Abstract: Code-mixing, the practice of switching between languages within a
conversation, presents unique challenges for traditional natural language
processing. Existing benchmarks, such as LinCE and GLUECoS, are limited by
narrow language pairings and tasks, failing to adequately evaluate the
code-mixing capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite the
significance of code-mixing for multilingual users, research on LLMs in this
context remains limited. Additionally, current methods for generating
code-mixed data are underdeveloped. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of LLMs' performance on code-mixed data across 18 languages from
seven language families. We also propose a novel approach for generating
synthetic code-mixed texts by combining word substitution with GPT-4 prompting.
Our analysis reveals consistent underperformance of LLMs on code-mixed datasets
involving multiple language families. We suggest that improvements in training
data size, model scale, and few-shot learning could enhance their performance.

### [5] [CueBuddy: helping non-native English speakers navigate English-centric STEM education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18827)
*Pranav Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CueBuddy提供实时词汇提示，帮助非英语母语的STEM学生理解复杂术语，而不干扰课堂专注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决STEM课堂中非英语母语学生因术语障碍而落后的现象。

Method: 通过实时技术关键词识别和多语言词汇表查询，提供词汇提示。

Result: CueBuddy帮助学生跟上复杂英语术语，提升学习效率。

Conclusion: 该方法有效但仍有局限，未来可进一步扩展。

Abstract: Students across the world in STEM classes, especially in the Global South,
fall behind their peers who are more fluent in English, despite being at par
with them in terms of scientific prerequisites. While many of them are able to
follow everyday English at ease, key terms in English stay challenging. In most
cases, such students have had most of their course prerequisites in a lower
resource language. Live speech translation to lower resource languages is a
promising area of research, however, models for speech translation can be too
expensive on a large scale and often struggle with technical content. In this
paper, we describe CueBuddy, which aims to remediate these issues by providing
real-time "lexical cues" through technical keyword spotting along real-time
multilingual glossary lookup to help students stay up to speed with complex
English jargon without disrupting their concentration on the lecture. We also
describe the limitations and future extensions of our approach.

*Mohammad Kachuee,Teja Gollapudi,Minseok Kim,Yin Huang,Kai Sun,Xiao Yang,Jiaqi Wang,Nirav Shah,Yue Liu,Aaron Colak,Anuj Kumar,Wen-tau Yih,Xin Luna Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PrismRAG通过训练模型处理干扰性半相关段落，并培养推理习惯，显著提升了检索增强生成（RAG）的事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG在检索到混淆性半相关段落或需要深度推理的问题时表现不佳的问题。

Method: 提出PrismRAG框架，通过干扰感知的QA对训练模型，并培养推理习惯。

Result: 在12个开放书RAG QA基准测试中，平均事实准确性提升5.4%。

Conclusion: PrismRAG优于现有解决方案，显著提升了RAG的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) often falls short when retrieved context
includes confusing semi-relevant passages, or when answering questions require
deep contextual understanding and reasoning. We propose an efficient
fine-tuning framework, called PrismRAG, that (i) trains the model with
distractor-aware QA pairs mixing gold evidence with subtle distractor passages,
and (ii) instills reasoning-centric habits that make the LLM plan, rationalize,
and synthesize without relying on extensive human engineered instructions.
Evaluated across 12 open-book RAG QA benchmarks spanning diverse application
domains and scenarios, PrismRAG improves average factuality by 5.4%,
outperforming state-of-the-art solutions.

### [7] [MindFlow+: A Self-Evolving Agent for E-Commerce Customer Service](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18884)
*Ming Gong,Xucheng Huang,Ziheng Xu,Vijayan K. Asari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MindFlow+是一种结合大型语言模型、模仿学习和离线强化学习的自进化对话代理，通过工具增强演示和奖励条件数据建模提升电商对话质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统意图系统难以处理动态多轮交互，需要更灵活的对话代理。

Method: 结合LLM、模仿学习和离线RL，引入工具增强演示和奖励条件数据建模。

Result: 在真实电商对话中，MindFlow+在上下文相关性、灵活性和任务准确性上优于基线。

Conclusion: 结合LLM、工具推理和奖励引导学习，可构建领域专业化、上下文感知的对话系统。

Abstract: High-quality dialogue is crucial for e-commerce customer service, yet
traditional intent-based systems struggle with dynamic, multi-turn
interactions. We present MindFlow+, a self-evolving dialogue agent that learns
domain-specific behavior by combining large language models (LLMs) with
imitation learning and offline reinforcement learning (RL). MindFlow+
introduces two data-centric mechanisms to guide learning: tool-augmented
demonstration construction, which exposes the model to knowledge-enhanced and
agentic (ReAct-style) interactions for effective tool use; and
reward-conditioned data modeling, which aligns responses with task-specific
goals using reward signals. To evaluate the model's role in response
generation, we introduce the AI Contribution Ratio, a novel metric quantifying
AI involvement in dialogue. Experiments on real-world e-commerce conversations
show that MindFlow+ outperforms strong baselines in contextual relevance,
flexibility, and task accuracy. These results demonstrate the potential of
combining LLMs tool reasoning, and reward-guided learning to build
domain-specialized, context-aware dialogue systems.

### [8] [NUTMEG: Separating Signal From Noise in Annotator Disagreement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18890)
*Jonathan Ivey,Susan Gauch,David Jurgens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NUTMEG是一种贝叶斯模型，通过考虑标注者背景信息，从人类标注数据中去除噪声，同时保留系统性分歧，优于传统聚合方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将标注分歧视为噪声，而实际上分歧可能是真实的信号。NUTMEG旨在区分噪声与系统性分歧。

Method: 提出NUTMEG模型，利用标注者背景信息，结合贝叶斯方法，分离噪声与系统性分歧。

Result: NUTMEG在合成数据中优于传统方法，能更准确地恢复真实标注。下游模型性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 在人类标注数据训练中，需同时考虑标注者能力和系统性分歧，NUTMEG为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: NLP models often rely on human-labeled data for training and evaluation. Many
approaches crowdsource this data from a large number of annotators with varying
skills, backgrounds, and motivations, resulting in conflicting annotations.
These conflicts have traditionally been resolved by aggregation methods that
assume disagreements are errors. Recent work has argued that for many tasks
annotators may have genuine disagreements and that variation should be treated
as signal rather than noise. However, few models separate signal and noise in
annotator disagreement. In this work, we introduce NUTMEG, a new Bayesian model
that incorporates information about annotator backgrounds to remove noisy
annotations from human-labeled training data while preserving systematic
disagreements. Using synthetic data, we show that NUTMEG is more effective at
recovering ground-truth from annotations with systematic disagreement than
traditional aggregation methods. We provide further analysis characterizing how
differences in subpopulation sizes, rates of disagreement, and rates of spam
affect the performance of our model. Finally, we demonstrate that downstream
models trained on NUTMEG-aggregated data significantly outperform models
trained on data from traditionally aggregation methods. Our results highlight
the importance of accounting for both annotator competence and systematic
disagreements when training on human-labeled data.

### [9] [REPRO-Bench: Can Agentic AI Systems Assess the Reproducibility of Social Science Research?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18901)
*Chuxuan Hu,Liyun Zhang,Yeji Lim,Aum Wadhwani,Austin Peters,Daniel Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: REPRO-Bench是一个评估AI代理自动化社会科学论文可重复性的新基准，解决了现有基准的不足，并通过实验展示了当前AI代理的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估AI代理自动化社会科学论文可重复性评估的能力，以解决现有基准的不足（如忽略与论文一致性、简化场景和数据多样性不足）。

Method: 引入REPRO-Bench，包含112个任务实例，每个实例对应一篇社会科学论文及其公开的复现报告，要求AI代理基于原始论文PDF和复现包评估可重复性。

Result: 评估了三种代表性AI代理，最佳代理准确率仅为21.4%；开发的REPRO-Agent将最高准确率提升了71%。

Conclusion: 需要开发更先进的AI代理以实现真实场景下的可重复性评估自动化。REPRO-Bench已公开。

Abstract: Assessing the reproducibility of social science papers is essential for
promoting rigor in research processes, but manual assessment is costly. With
recent advances in agentic AI systems (i.e., AI agents), we seek to evaluate
their capability to automate this process. However, existing benchmarks for
reproducing research papers (1) focus solely on reproducing results using
provided code and data without assessing their consistency with the paper, (2)
oversimplify real-world scenarios, and (3) lack necessary diversity in data
formats and programming languages. To address these issues, we introduce
REPRO-Bench, a collection of 112 task instances, each representing a social
science paper with a publicly available reproduction report. The agents are
tasked with assessing the reproducibility of the paper based on the original
paper PDF and the corresponding reproduction package. REPRO-Bench features
end-to-end evaluation tasks on the reproducibility of social science papers
with complexity comparable to real-world assessments. We evaluate three
representative AI agents on REPRO-Bench, with the best-performing agent
achieving an accuracy of only 21.4%. Building on our empirical analysis, we
develop REPRO-Agent, which improves the highest accuracy achieved by existing
agents by 71%. We conclude that more advanced AI agents should be developed to
automate real-world reproducibility assessment. REPRO-Bench is publicly
available at https://github.com/uiuc-kang-lab/REPRO-Bench.

### [10] [SLoW: Select Low-frequency Words! Automatic Dictionary Selection for Translation on Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18902)
*Hongyuan Lu,Zixuan Li,Zefan Zhang,Wai Lam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为自动词典选择（ADS）的新任务，旨在通过选择低频词典来优化翻译性能和减少token消耗。提出的SLoW方法无需训练数据，实验表明其在100种语言上优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLM）仅支持数百种语言，而全球有7000多种语言。现有的词典提示方法通常使用全部词典，成本高昂。因此，需要在token消耗和翻译性能之间找到平衡。

Method: 提出SLoW方法，自动选择低频词典来增强翻译，无需训练数据或额外调优。

Result: 在FLORES的100种语言上，SLoW优于基线方法，显著节省token使用，部分语言甚至超越全词典基线的翻译性能。

Conclusion: SLoW方法在无需训练数据的情况下，有效提升了翻译性能并降低了成本，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: There are more than 7,000 languages around the world, and current Large
Language Models (LLMs) only support hundreds of languages. Dictionary-based
prompting methods can enhance translation on them, but most methods use all the
available dictionaries, which could be expensive. Instead, it will be flexible
to have a trade-off between token consumption and translation performance. This
paper proposes a novel task called \textbf{A}utomatic \textbf{D}ictionary
\textbf{S}election (\textbf{ADS}). The goal of the task is to automatically
select which dictionary to use to enhance translation. We propose a novel and
effective method which we call \textbf{S}elect \textbf{Lo}w-frequency
\textbf{W}ords! (\textbf{SLoW}) which selects those dictionaries that have a
lower frequency. Our methods have unique advantages. First, there is no need
for access to the training data for frequency estimation (which is usually
unavailable). Second, it inherits the advantage of dictionary-based methods,
where no additional tuning is required on LLMs. Experimental results on 100
languages from FLORES indicate that SLoW surpasses strong baselines, and it can
obviously save token usage, with many languages even surpassing the translation
performance of the full dictionary baseline.\footnote{A shocking fact is that
there is no need to use the actual training data (often unobtainable) for
frequency estimation, and an estimation frequency obtained using public
resources is still apparently effective in improving translation with ChatGPT
and Llama, and DeepSeek.}\footnote{Code and data available upon publication.}

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，公开可用的医疗聊天机器人（Claude、Gemini、GPT-4o、Llama3-70B）在提供医疗建议时存在显著差异，部分回答可能对患者安全构成威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估公开聊天机器人在医疗建议中的安全性，以解决患者使用这些工具时可能面临的风险。

Method: 通过红队测试，对四个聊天机器人在222个医疗问题上的888个回答进行定量和定性分析。

Result: 问题回答率从21.6%（Claude）到43.2%（Llama），不安全回答率从5%（Claude）到13%（GPT-4o、Llama）。

Conclusion: 数百万患者可能从公开聊天机器人处获得不安全医疗建议，需进一步改进这些工具的安全性。

Abstract: Millions of patients are already using large language model (LLM) chatbots
for medical advice on a regular basis, raising patient safety concerns. This
physician-led red-teaming study compares the safety of four publicly available
chatbots--Claude by Anthropic, Gemini by Google, GPT-4o by OpenAI, and
Llama3-70B by Meta--on a new dataset, HealthAdvice, using an evaluation
framework that enables quantitative and qualitative analysis. In total, 888
chatbot responses are evaluated for 222 patient-posed advice-seeking medical
questions on primary care topics spanning internal medicine, women's health,
and pediatrics. We find statistically significant differences between chatbots.
The rate of problematic responses varies from 21.6 percent (Claude) to 43.2
percent (Llama), with unsafe responses varying from 5 percent (Claude) to 13
percent (GPT-4o, Llama). Qualitative results reveal chatbot responses with the
potential to lead to serious patient harm. This study suggests that millions of
patients could be receiving unsafe medical advice from publicly available
chatbots, and further work is needed to improve the clinical safety of these
powerful tools.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) represents a major advancement in
natural language processing (NLP), combining large language models (LLMs) with
information retrieval systems to enhance factual grounding, accuracy, and
contextual relevance. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic review of
RAG, tracing its evolution from early developments in open domain question
answering to recent state-of-the-art implementations across diverse
applications. The review begins by outlining the motivations behind RAG,
particularly its ability to mitigate hallucinations and outdated knowledge in
parametric models. Core technical components-retrieval mechanisms,
sequence-to-sequence generation models, and fusion strategies are examined in
detail. A year-by-year analysis highlights key milestones and research trends,
providing insight into RAG's rapid growth. The paper further explores the
deployment of RAG in enterprise systems, addressing practical challenges
related to retrieval of proprietary data, security, and scalability. A
comparative evaluation of RAG implementations is conducted, benchmarking
performance on retrieval accuracy, generation fluency, latency, and
computational efficiency. Persistent challenges such as retrieval quality,
privacy concerns, and integration overhead are critically assessed. Finally,
the review highlights emerging solutions, including hybrid retrieval
approaches, privacy-preserving techniques, optimized fusion strategies, and
agentic RAG architectures. These innovations point toward a future of more
reliable, efficient, and context-aware knowledge-intensive NLP systems.

*Ananya Sahu,Amith Ananthram,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种从无标签数据集中挖掘视觉元素关联的方法，用于生成高质量创意标题，并在MSCOCO数据集上验证了其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型依赖简短、字面的网络数据，缺乏对创意输出的理解能力。

Method: 通过挖掘图像中显著视觉元素的关联，生成多层次的抽象创意标题。

Result: 生成了包含170万创意标题的新数据集，并在诗歌和隐喻可视化领域提升了零样本检索性能。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效提升创意领域的视觉语言模型表现，并公开了数据集和模型。

Abstract: Understanding another person's creative output requires a shared language of
association. However, when training vision-language models such as CLIP, we
rely on web-scraped datasets containing short, predominantly literal, alt-text.
In this work, we introduce a method for mining contextualized associations for
salient visual elements in an image that can scale to any unlabeled dataset.
Given an image, we can use these mined associations to generate high quality
creative captions at increasing degrees of abstraction. With our method, we
produce a new dataset of visual associations and 1.7m creative captions for the
images in MSCOCO. Human evaluation confirms that these captions remain visually
grounded while exhibiting recognizably increasing abstraction. Moreover,
fine-tuning a visual encoder on this dataset yields meaningful improvements in
zero-shot image-text retrieval in two creative domains: poetry and metaphor
visualization. We release our dataset, our generation code and our models for
use by the broader community.

### [14] [Uncovering Cross-Linguistic Disparities in LLMs using Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18918)
*Richmond Sin Jing Xuan,Jalil Huseynov,Yang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 多语言大语言模型（LLM）在跨语言泛化中表现优异，但中低资源语言在常见基准测试中表现不佳。通过分析Gemma-2-2B的激活模式，发现中低资源语言在早期层激活较低。采用LoRA进行激活感知微调后，显著提升了这些语言的激活水平，同时保持英语性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究中低资源语言在LLM中表现不佳的原因，并提出改进方法。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（SAEs）分析激活模式，并通过LoRA进行激活感知微调。

Result: 中低资源语言激活水平显著提升（如马拉雅拉姆语87.69%，印地语86.32%），基准测试结果有稳定改进。

Conclusion: 激活对齐是提升多语言LLM性能的关键因素。

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong cross-linguistic
generalization, yet medium to low resource languages underperform on common
benchmarks such as ARC-Challenge, MMLU, and HellaSwag. We analyze activation
patterns in Gemma-2-2B across all 26 residual layers and 10 languages: Chinese
(zh), Russian (ru), Spanish (es), Italian (it), medium to low resource
languages including Indonesian (id), Catalan (ca), Marathi (mr), Malayalam
(ml), and Hindi (hi), with English (en) as the reference. Using Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs), we reveal systematic disparities in activation patterns.
Medium to low resource languages receive up to 26.27 percent lower activations
in early layers, with a persistent gap of 19.89 percent in deeper layers. To
address this, we apply activation-aware fine-tuning via Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), leading to substantial activation gains, such as 87.69 percent for
Malayalam and 86.32 percent for Hindi, while maintaining English retention at
approximately 91 percent. After fine-tuning, benchmark results show modest but
consistent improvements, highlighting activation alignment as a key factor in
enhancing multilingual LLM performance.

*Jingxuan Wei,Caijun Jia,Qi Chen,Yujun Cai,Linzhuang Sun,Xiangxiang Zhang,Gaowei Wu,Bihui Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLaVA-NeuMT是一种新型多模态多语言翻译框架，通过显式建模语言特定和语言无关表示，减少多语言干扰，并在参数效率上优于全微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态机器翻译方法在双语场景表现良好，但扩展到多语言翻译时面临跨语言干扰和参数共享策略低效的问题。

Method: 提出层选择机制和神经元级适应策略，动态选择语言特定和无关的神经元，优化翻译质量并减少冗余。

Result: 在M3-Multi30K和M3-AmbigCaps数据集上，仅微调40%参数即超越全微调方法，达到SOTA结果。

Conclusion: LLaVA-NeuMT为多模态多语言翻译提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案，并揭示了层和神经元选择在适应中的重要性。

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) enhances translation quality by
incorporating visual context, helping to resolve textual ambiguities. While
existing MMT methods perform well in bilingual settings, extending them to
multilingual translation remains challenging due to cross-lingual interference
and ineffective parameter-sharing strategies. To address this, we propose
LLaVA-NeuMT, a novel multimodal multilingual translation framework that
explicitly models language-specific and language-agnostic representations to
mitigate multilingual interference. Our approach consists of a layer selection
mechanism that identifies the most informative layers for different language
pairs and a neuron-level adaptation strategy that dynamically selects
language-specific and agnostic neurons to improve translation quality while
reducing redundancy. We conduct extensive experiments on the M3-Multi30K and

Conclusion: 该技术有望改变法律行业的工作流程，强调自动化在优化司法过程中的作用。

Abstract: Legal document summarization represents a significant advancement towards
improving judicial efficiency through the automation of key information
detection. Our approach leverages state-of-the-art natural language processing
techniques to meticulously identify and extract essential data from extensive
legal texts, which facilitates a more efficient review process. By employing
advanced machine learning algorithms, the framework recognizes underlying
patterns within judicial documents to create precise summaries that encapsulate
the crucial elements. This automation alleviates the burden on legal
professionals, concurrently reducing the likelihood of overlooking vital
information that could lead to errors. Through comprehensive experiments
conducted with actual legal datasets, we demonstrate the capability of our
method to generate high-quality summaries while preserving the integrity of the
original content and enhancing processing times considerably. The results
reveal marked improvements in operational efficiency, allowing legal
practitioners to direct their efforts toward critical analytical and
decision-making activities instead of manual reviews. This research highlights
promising technology-driven strategies that can significantly alter workflow
dynamics within the legal sector, emphasizing the role of automation in
refining judicial processes.

*Sang Min Jung,Kaixiang Zhang,Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于比较对话动态相似性的度量方法，并验证其鲁棒性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法全面比较对话的整体交互动态，需要一种更全面的方法来分析和评估对话数据。

Method: 设计了一种对话动态相似性度量方法，并构建验证框架测试其鲁棒性和对话题的敏感性。

Result: 该方法成功应用于大型在线社区对话分析，揭示了情境权力在对话中的作用。

Conclusion: 提出的相似性度量方法为对话动态分析提供了新工具，有助于更全面地评估对话质量。

Abstract: The quality of a conversation goes beyond the individual quality of each
reply, and instead emerges from how these combine into interactional patterns
that give the conversation its distinctive overall "shape". However, there is
no robust automated method for comparing conversations in terms of their
overall interactional dynamics. Such methods could enhance the analysis of
conversational data and help evaluate conversational agents more holistically.
  In this work, we introduce a similarity measure for comparing conversations
with respect to their dynamics. We design a validation framework for testing
the robustness of the metric in capturing differences in conversation dynamics
and for assessing its sensitivity to the topic of the conversations. Finally,
to illustrate the measure's utility, we use it to analyze conversational
dynamics in a large online community, bringing new insights into the role of
situational power in conversations.

*Bohan Yao,Vikas Yadav*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multi-TAG是一种多工具聚合框架，通过同时调用多个工具增强LLM的数学推理能力，无需微调即可显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强方法在复杂数学问题上表现不佳，需改进以支持多步精确推理。

Method: Multi-TAG框架在推理步骤中同时调用多个工具，并聚合其输出以验证和优化推理过程。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Multi-TAG平均提升6.0%至7.5%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Multi-TAG为无需微调的高性能数学推理系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external tools is a promising
avenue for developing high-performance mathematical reasoning systems. Prior
tool-augmented approaches typically finetune an LLM to select and invoke a
single tool at each reasoning step and show promising results on simpler math
reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K. However, these approaches struggle with
more complex math problems that require precise reasoning over multiple steps.
To address this limitation, in this work, we propose Multi-TAG, a Multi-Tool
AGgregation-based framework. Instead of relying on a single tool, Multi-TAG
guides an LLM to concurrently invoke multiple tools at each reasoning step. It
then aggregates their diverse outputs to verify and refine the reasoning
process, enhancing solution robustness and accuracy. Notably, Multi-TAG is a
finetuning-free, inference-only framework, making it readily applicable to any
LLM backbone, including large open-weight models which are computationally
expensive to finetune and proprietary frontier models which cannot be finetuned
with custom recipes. We evaluate Multi-TAG on four challenging benchmarks:
MATH500, AIME, AMC, and OlympiadBench. Across both open-weight and
closed-source LLM backbones, Multi-TAG consistently and substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average improvements of 6.0%
to 7.5% over state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 论证摘要的生成阶段研究不足，现有方法缺乏对事实修正和结构优化的支持。

Method: 结合掩码控制器和充分性检查模块，通过迭代的掩码和再生改进摘要。

Result: 在10个自动评估指标中7个超越现有方法，人工评估在覆盖性、忠实性和简洁性上显著提升。

Conclusion: Arg-LLaDA的迭代生成策略有效提升了论证摘要的质量。

Abstract: Argument summarization aims to generate concise, structured representations
of complex, multi-perspective debates. While recent work has advanced the
identification and clustering of argumentative components, the generation stage
remains underexplored. Existing approaches typically rely on single-pass
generation, offering limited support for factual correction or structural
refinement. To address this gap, we introduce Arg-LLaDA, a novel large language
diffusion framework that iteratively improves summaries via sufficiency-guided
remasking and regeneration. Our method combines a flexible masking controller
with a sufficiency-checking module to identify and revise unsupported,
redundant, or incomplete spans, yielding more faithful, concise, and coherent
outputs. Empirical results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that Arg-LLaDA
surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in 7 out of 10 automatic evaluation
metrics. In addition, human evaluations reveal substantial improvements across
core dimensions, coverage, faithfulness, and conciseness, validating the
effectiveness of our iterative, sufficiency-aware generation strategy.

Motivation: 现有单LLM方法难以处理涉及多面证据的复杂声明验证，受现实世界事实核查实践启发，提出辩论驱动方法。

Method: 使用两个Debater代理持对立立场进行多轮辩论，Moderator评估并裁决；引入合成辩论数据的后训练策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在不同证据质量下优于现有声明验证方法。

Conclusion: DebateCV框架通过辩论驱动和训练策略有效解决了复杂声明验证问题。

Abstract: Claim verification is critical for enhancing digital literacy. However, the
state-of-the-art single-LLM methods struggle with complex claim verification
that involves multi-faceted evidences. Inspired by real-world fact-checking
practices, we propose DebateCV, the first claim verification framework that
adopts a debate-driven methodology using multiple LLM agents. In our framework,
two Debaters take opposing stances on a claim and engage in multi-round
argumentation, while a Moderator evaluates the arguments and renders a verdict
with justifications. To further improve the performance of the Moderator, we
introduce a novel post-training strategy that leverages synthetic debate data
generated by the zero-shot DebateCV, effectively addressing the scarcity of
real-world debate-driven claim verification data. Experimental results show
that our method outperforms existing claim verification methods under varying
levels of evidence quality. Our code and dataset are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主题质量评估方法（如连贯性和单词侵入）未能衡量主题对语料库探索的促进作用，因此需要基于任务和用户群体的评估方法。

Method: 通过用户研究了解用户如何解释主题，提出主题质量构建，并利用反思性主题分析从用户评价中识别主题解释模式。

Result: 用户基于可用性和代表性启发式解释主题，而非概率。提出基于锚定调整启发式的主题解释理论。

Conclusion: 主题解释可视为生态理性用户在不确定性下的判断，需考虑认知偏差的用户模型和评估框架。

Abstract: Interpretation of topics is crucial for their downstream applications.
State-of-the-art evaluation measures of topic quality such as coherence and
word intrusion do not measure how much a topic facilitates the exploration of a
corpus. To design evaluation measures grounded on a task, and a population of
users, we do user studies to understand how users interpret topics. We propose
constructs of topic quality and ask users to assess them in the context of a
topic and provide rationale behind evaluations. We use reflexive thematic
analysis to identify themes of topic interpretations from rationales. Users
interpret topics based on availability and representativeness heuristics rather
than probability. We propose a theory of topic interpretation based on the
anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic: users anchor on salient words and make
semantic adjustments to arrive at an interpretation. Topic interpretation can
be viewed as making a judgment under uncertainty by an ecologically rational
user, and hence cognitive biases aware user models and evaluation frameworks
are needed.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成内容时如何延续性别和职业偏见，尤其是意大利语中的表现。实验发现ChatGPT和Gemini在回答中表现出明显的偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的广泛应用引发了对其可能延续偏见和生成不公平内容的担忧，尤其是在非英语语言中。

Method: 通过结构化实验方法，对两种LLM（ChatGPT和Gemini）进行测试，收集3600条回答，分析其对性别和职业偏见的反应。

Result: 结果显示LLMs存在显著偏见，例如Gemini将100%的“她”代词与“助理”而非“经理”关联。

Conclusion: 研究强调了LLMs生成内容中的偏见风险，需开发缓解策略以确保AI系统不加剧社会不平等。

Abstract: The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in a large variety of
domains has sparked worries about how easily they can perpetuate stereotypes
and contribute to the generation of biased content. With a focus on gender and
professional bias, this work examines in which manner LLMs shape responses to
ungendered prompts, contributing to biased outputs. This analysis uses a
structured experimental method, giving different prompts involving three
different professional job combinations, which are also characterized by a
hierarchical relationship. This study uses Italian, a language with extensive
grammatical gender differences, to highlight potential limitations in current
LLMs' ability to generate objective text in non-English languages. Two popular
LLM-based chatbots are examined, namely OpenAI ChatGPT (gpt-4o-mini) and Google
Gemini (gemini-1.5-flash). Through APIs, we collected a range of 3600
responses. The results highlight how content generated by LLMs can perpetuate
stereotypes. For example, Gemini associated 100% (ChatGPT 97%) of 'she'
pronouns to the 'assistant' rather than the 'manager'. The presence of bias in
AI-generated text can have significant implications in many fields, such as in
the workplaces or in job selections, raising ethical concerns about its use.
Understanding these risks is pivotal to developing mitigation strategies and
assuring that AI-based systems do not increase social inequalities, but rather
contribute to more equitable outcomes. Future research directions include
expanding the study to additional chatbots or languages, refining prompt
engineering methods or further exploiting a larger experimental base.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，大型语言模型（LLMs）在数据中毒和方言差异（如AAVE与SAE）的共同作用下，会显著增加对AAVE输入的毒性输出，而对SAE影响较小。模型规模越大，放大效应越明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨方言差异（AAVE与SAE）和数据中毒如何共同影响LLMs输出的毒性，揭示模型在公平性方面的潜在问题。

Method: 使用不同规模的LLaMA模型，通过数据中毒实验，比较AAVE和SAE输入的毒性输出差异，并利用GPT-4o作为公平性审计工具。

Result: 数据中毒显著增加AAVE输入的毒性输出，而对SAE影响较小；模型规模越大，放大效应越明显。GPT-4o审计发现AAVE输入更易关联有害刻板印象。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了数据中毒和方言偏见的复合影响，呼吁开发方言感知的评估方法、针对性去偏干预措施及社会责任训练协议。

Abstract: Despite the ongoing improvements in the design of large language models
(LLMs) to foster inclusion and balanced responses, these systems remain
susceptible to encoding and amplifying social biases. This study examines how
dialectal variation, specifically African American Vernacular English (AAVE)
versus Standard American English (SAE), interacts with data poisoning to
influence toxicity in outputs. Using both small- and medium-scale LLaMA models,
we show that even minimal exposure to poisoned data significantly increases
toxicity for AAVE inputs, while it remains comparatively unaffected for SAE.
Larger models exhibit a more significant amplification effect which suggests
heightened susceptibility with scale. To further assess these disparities, we
employed GPT-4o as a fairness auditor, which identified harmful stereotypical
patterns disproportionately tied to AAVE inputs, including portrayals of
aggression, criminality, and intellectual inferiority. These findings
underscore the compounding impact of data poisoning and dialectal bias and
emphasize the need for dialect-aware evaluation, targeted debiasing
interventions, and socially responsible training protocols during development.

TL;DR: 论文提出ArxivRoll框架，通过动态生成私有测试用例和量化污染程度，解决大语言模型评估中的高估问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共基准测试的污染或模型训练不平衡导致大语言模型评估结果失真，现有方法无法同时保证可重复性、透明性和高效性。

Method: 提出ArxivRoll框架，包含SCP（自动生成私有测试用例）和Rugged Scores（量化污染和训练偏差），每六个月基于ArXiv文章构建新基准。

Result: 实验证明基准质量高，并系统评估了当前大语言模型。

Conclusion: ArxivRoll有效解决了评估中的高估问题，提供了透明且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Overestimation in evaluating large language models (LLMs) has become an
increasing concern. Due to the contamination of public benchmarks or imbalanced
model training, LLMs may achieve unreal evaluation results on public
benchmarks, either intentionally or unintentionally, which leads to unfair
comparisons among LLMs and undermines their realistic capability assessments.
Existing benchmarks attempt to address these issues by keeping test cases
permanently secret, mitigating contamination through human evaluation, or
repeatedly collecting and constructing new samples. However, these approaches
fail to ensure reproducibility, transparency, and high efficiency
simultaneously. Moreover, the extent of overestimation in current LLMs remains
unquantified. To address these issues, we propose ArxivRoll, a dynamic
evaluation framework inspired by one-time pad encryption in cryptography.
ArxivRoll comprises two key components: \emph{i) SCP (Sequencing, Cloze, and
Prediction)}, an automated generator for private test cases, and \emph{ii)
Rugged Scores (RS)}, metrics that measure the proportion of public benchmark
contamination and training bias. Leveraging SCP, ArxivRoll constructs a new
benchmark every six months using recent articles from ArXiv and employs them
for one-time evaluations of LLM performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the high quality of our benchmark, and we provide a systematic evaluation of
current LLMs. The source code is available at

Result: PAD攻击成功率达97%，LLDMs有害生成速度是LLMs的2倍。

Conclusion: LLDMs存在显著安全风险，需进一步研究以确保其安全部署。

Abstract: Large Language Diffusion Models (LLDMs) exhibit comparable performance to
LLMs while offering distinct advantages in inference speed and mathematical
reasoning tasks.The precise and rapid generation capabilities of LLDMs amplify
concerns of harmful generations, while existing jailbreak methodologies
designed for Large Language Models (LLMs) prove limited effectiveness against
LLDMs and fail to expose safety vulnerabilities.Successful defense cannot
definitively resolve harmful generation concerns, as it remains unclear whether
LLDMs possess safety robustness or existing attacks are incompatible with
diffusion-based architectures.To address this, we first reveal the
vulnerability of LLDMs to jailbreak and demonstrate that attack failure in
LLDMs stems from fundamental architectural differences.We present a PArallel
Decoding jailbreak (PAD) for diffusion-based language models. PAD introduces
Multi-Point Attention Attack, which guides parallel generative processes toward
harmful outputs that inspired by affirmative response patterns in LLMs.
Experimental evaluations across four LLDMs demonstrate that PAD achieves
jailbreak attack success rates by 97%, revealing significant safety
vulnerabilities. Furthermore, compared to autoregressive LLMs of the same size,
LLDMs increase the harmful generation speed by 2x, significantly highlighting
risks of uncontrolled misuse.Through comprehensive analysis, we provide an
investigation into LLDM architecture, offering critical insights for the secure
deployment of diffusion-based language models.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在识别和分类复杂的社会科学概念（如民粹主义）方面的能力，发现其性能参差不齐，且微调的RoBERTa模型表现优于指令调优的LLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs对社会科学中复杂概念（如民粹主义）的理解能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过构建专门的数据集，评估多种预训练语言模型在不同提示范式下的表现，并比较微调模型与指令调优模型的性能。

Result: 微调的RoBERTa模型在检测民粹主义话语方面表现最佳，而指令调优的LLMs在跨领域数据上更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LLMs在社会科学领域的应用仍有局限性，微调模型在特定任务上表现更优，但指令调优模型在泛化能力上更具优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of instruction-following tasks, yet their grasp of nuanced social
science concepts remains underexplored. This paper examines whether LLMs can
identify and classify fine-grained forms of populism, a complex and contested
concept in both academic and media debates. To this end, we curate and release
novel datasets specifically designed to capture populist discourse. We evaluate
a range of pre-trained (large) language models, both open-weight and
proprietary, across multiple prompting paradigms. Our analysis reveals notable
variation in performance, highlighting the limitations of LLMs in detecting
populist discourse. We find that a fine-tuned RoBERTa classifier vastly
outperforms all new-era instruction-tuned LLMs, unless fine-tuned.
Additionally, we apply our best-performing model to analyze campaign speeches
by Donald Trump, extracting valuable insights into his strategic use of
populist rhetoric. Finally, we assess the generalizability of these models by
benchmarking them on campaign speeches by European politicians, offering a lens
into cross-context transferability in political discourse analysis. In this
setting, we find that instruction-tuned LLMs exhibit greater robustness on
out-of-domain data.

Conclusion: AutoPCR在表型概念识别任务中表现出色，适用于新本体。

Abstract: Phenotype concept recognition (CR) is a fundamental task in biomedical text
mining, enabling applications such as clinical diagnostics and knowledge graph
construction. However, existing methods often require ontology-specific
training and struggle to generalize across diverse text types and evolving
biomedical terminology. We present AutoPCR, a prompt-based phenotype CR method
that does not require ontology-specific training. AutoPCR performs CR in three
stages: entity extraction using a hybrid of rule-based and neural tagging
strategies, candidate retrieval via SapBERT, and entity linking through
prompting a large language model. Experiments on four benchmark datasets show
that AutoPCR achieves the best average and most robust performance across both
mention-level and document-level evaluations, surpassing prior state-of-the-art
methods. Further ablation and transfer studies demonstrate its inductive
capability and generalizability to new ontologies.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Smooth Reading的分块推理方法，显著缩小了Recurrent LLMs与Self-Attention LLMs在长上下文任务中的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recurrent LLMs因固定大小内存限制在长上下文任务中表现不佳，传统方法通过架构创新提升内存容量但效果有限。

Method: Smooth Reading方法分块处理上下文并迭代总结信息，减少内存需求，更适合Recurrent LLMs。

Result: 实验显示，该方法将Recurrent LLMs的性能差距从5.68%缩小至3.61%，同时保持高效性。

Conclusion: Smooth Reading首次使Recurrent LLMs在长上下文任务中达到与Self-Attention LLMs相当的性能，为未来研究提供启发。

Abstract: Recently, recurrent large language models (Recurrent LLMs) with linear
computational complexity have re-emerged as efficient alternatives to
self-attention-based LLMs (Self-Attention LLMs), which have quadratic
complexity. However, Recurrent LLMs often underperform on long-context tasks
due to their limited fixed-size memory. Previous research has primarily focused
on enhancing the memory capacity of Recurrent LLMs through architectural
innovations, but these approaches have not yet enabled Recurrent LLMs to match
the performance of Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We argue that
this limitation arises because processing the entire context at once is not
well-suited for Recurrent LLMs. In this paper, we propose Smooth Reading, a
chunk-wise inference method inspired by human reading strategies. Smooth
Reading processes context in chunks and iteratively summarizes the contextual
information, thereby reducing memory demands and making the approach more
compatible with Recurrent LLMs. Our experimental results show that this method
substantially narrows the performance gap between Recurrent and Self-Attention
LLMs on long-context tasks, while preserving the efficiency advantages of
Recurrent LLMs. Our Smooth Reading boosts SWA-3B-4k (a Recurrent LLM) from
5.68% lower to 3.61% higher performance than Self-Attention LLMs on LongBench.
Besides, our method maintains the high efficiency, training 3x faster and
inferring 2x faster at 64k context compared to Self-Attention LLMs. To our
knowledge, this is the first work to achieve comparable performance using
Recurrent LLMs compared with Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We hope
our method will inspire future research in this area. To facilitate further
progress, we will release code and dataset.

Method: 使用预训练的ASR和说话人分割模型，结合RoBERTa和Wav2Vec嵌入，通过交叉注意力融合和门控机制实现对齐。

Result: 在IEMOCAP数据集上，精确的时间戳对齐显著提高了情感识别准确性，优于未同步的基线方法。

Conclusion: 时间戳对齐对多模态情感分析至关重要，为提升整体识别准确性提供了有效方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of incorporating timestamp-based
alignment between Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcripts and Speaker
Diarization (SD) outputs on Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) accuracy.
Misalignment between these two modalities often reduces the reliability of
multimodal emotion recognition systems, particularly in conversational
contexts. To address this issue, we introduce an alignment pipeline utilizing
pre-trained ASR and speaker diarization models, systematically synchronizing
timestamps to generate accurately labeled speaker segments. Our multimodal
approach combines textual embeddings extracted via RoBERTa with audio
embeddings from Wav2Vec, leveraging cross-attention fusion enhanced by a gating
mechanism. Experimental evaluations on the IEMOCAP benchmark dataset
demonstrate that precise timestamp alignment improves SER accuracy,
outperforming baseline methods that lack synchronization. The results highlight
the critical importance of temporal alignment, demonstrating its effectiveness
in enhancing overall emotion recognition accuracy and providing a foundation
for robust multimodal emotion analysis.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于语音的智商评估方法（SIQ），用于评估语音理解大语言模型（LLM Voice）的能力，超越了传统的词错误率（WER）等指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音理解评估指标（如WER）无法全面衡量模型的多层次认知能力，因此需要一种更全面的评估框架。

Method: SIQ基于布鲁姆分类法，从三个认知层次评估模型：记忆（WER）、理解（解释相似性）和应用（问答准确性）。

Result: SIQ不仅能量化语音理解能力，还能统一比较级联方法和端到端模型，发现现有基准中的标注错误，并检测LLM Voice的幻觉问题。

Conclusion: SIQ是首个将认知原则与语音导向基准结合的智能评估框架，揭示了多模态训练中被忽视的挑战。

Abstract: We introduce Speech-based Intelligence Quotient (SIQ) as a new form of human
cognition-inspired evaluation pipeline for voice understanding large language
models, LLM Voice, designed to assess their voice understanding ability. Moving
beyond popular voice understanding metrics such as word error rate (WER), SIQ
examines LLM Voice across three cognitive levels motivated by Bloom's Taxonomy:
(1) Remembering (i.e., WER for verbatim accuracy); (2) Understanding (i.e.,
similarity of LLM's interpretations); and (3) Application (i.e., QA accuracy
for simulating downstream tasks). We demonstrate that SIQ not only quantifies
voice understanding abilities but also provides unified comparisons between
cascaded methods (e.g., ASR LLM) and end-to-end models, identifies annotation
errors in existing benchmarks, and detects hallucinations in LLM Voice. Our
framework represents a first-of-its-kind intelligence examination that bridges
cognitive principles with voice-oriented benchmarks, while exposing overlooked
challenges in multi-modal training.

Method: 提出全自动方法生成音频-文本对，并设计客观指标评估数据质量。

Result: 在S&I Corpus上实验验证了增强语料库在书面和口语语法纠错中的有效性。

Conclusion: 增强数据集能丰富原始语料库，同时保持语言评估分数不变。

Abstract: While there exist strong benchmark datasets for grammatical error correction
(GEC), high-quality annotated spoken datasets for Spoken GEC (SGEC) are still
under-resourced. In this paper, we propose a fully automated method to generate
audio-text pairs with grammatical errors and disfluencies. Moreover, we propose
a series of objective metrics that can be used to evaluate the generated data
and choose the more suitable dataset for SGEC. The goal is to generate an
augmented dataset that maintains the textual and acoustic characteristics of
the original data while providing new types of errors. This augmented dataset
should augment and enrich the original corpus without altering the language
assessment scores of the second language (L2) learners. We evaluate the use of
the augmented corpus both for written GEC (the text part) and for SGEC (the
audio-text pairs). Our experiments are conducted on the S\&I Corpus, the first
publicly available speech dataset with grammar error annotations.

TL;DR: 该研究为荷兰临床自由文本中的药物不良事件（ADE）检测设定了基准，比较了多种Transformer模型和Bi-LSTM模型的表现，MedRoBERTa.nl表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为荷兰临床自由文本中的ADE检测提供基准，并评估不同模型在此任务中的表现。

Method: 使用102份荷兰ICU临床进展笔记，训练了Bi-LSTM和四种Transformer模型（BERTje、RobBERT、MedRoBERTa.nl、NuNER），进行命名实体识别（NER）和关系分类（RC）任务。

Result: MedRoBERTa.nl在ADE RC任务中表现最佳，宏平均F1得分为0.63（黄金标准）和0.62（预测实体），外部验证中召回率为0.67至0.74。

Conclusion: 研究提出了一个稳健且临床意义显著的ADE检测评估方法，强调了使用适合任务的性能指标的重要性。

Abstract: In this study, we set a benchmark for adverse drug event (ADE) detection in
Dutch clinical free text documents using several transformer models, clinical
scenarios and fit-for-purpose performance measures. We trained a Bidirectional
Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model and four transformer-based Dutch and/or
multilingual encoder models (BERTje, RobBERT, MedRoBERTa.nl, and NuNER) for the
tasks of named entity recognition (NER) and relation classification (RC) using
102 richly annotated Dutch ICU clinical progress notes. Anonymized free text
clinical progress notes of patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of
one academic hospital and discharge letters of patients admitted to Internal
Medicine wards of two non-academic hospitals were reused. We evaluated our ADE
RC models internally using gold standard (two-step task) and predicted entities
(end-to-end task). In addition, all models were externally validated on
detecting ADEs at the document level. We report both micro- and macro-averaged
F1 scores, given the imbalance of ADEs in the datasets. Although differences
for the ADE RC task between the models were small, MedRoBERTa.nl was the best
performing model with macro-averaged F1 score of 0.63 using gold standard and
0.62 using predicted entities. The MedRoBERTa.nl models also performed the best
in our external validation and achieved recall of between 0.67 to 0.74 using
predicted entities, meaning between 67 to 74% of discharge letters with ADEs
were detected. Our benchmark study presents a robust and clinically meaningful
approach for evaluating language models for ADE detection in clinical free text
documents. Our study highlights the need to use appropriate performance
measures fit for the task of ADE detection in clinical free-text documents and
envisioned future clinical use.

Motivation: 现有医学文本嵌入模型存在数据覆盖不足和方法过时的问题，且评估标准不够全面。

Method: 利用自监督对比学习在多样化医学语料库上微调MEDTE模型，并设计包含51项任务的基准测试套件。

Result: MEDTE模型在多项任务中表现优于现有方法，同时基准测试提供了更全面的评估框架。

Conclusion: 该研究为医学文本嵌入提供了更优的模型和评估标准，推动了相关应用的发展。

Abstract: Medical text embedding models are foundational to a wide array of healthcare
applications, ranging from clinical decision support and biomedical information
retrieval to medical question answering, yet they remain hampered by two
critical shortcomings. First, most models are trained on a narrow slice of
medical and biological data, beside not being up to date in terms of
methodology, making them ill suited to capture the diversity of terminology and
semantics encountered in practice. Second, existing evaluations are often
inadequate: even widely used benchmarks fail to generalize across the full
spectrum of real world medical tasks.
  To address these gaps, we leverage MEDTE, a GTE model extensively fine-tuned
on diverse medical corpora through self-supervised contrastive learning across
multiple data sources, to deliver robust medical text embeddings.
  Alongside this model, we propose a comprehensive benchmark suite of 51 tasks
spanning classification, clustering, pair classification, and retrieval modeled
on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) but tailored to the nuances of
medical text. Our results demonstrate that this combined approach not only
establishes a robust evaluation framework but also yields embeddings that
consistently outperform state of the art alternatives in different tasks.

TL;DR: GEPA（Genetic-Pareto）是一种基于自然语言反思的提示优化器，通过少量试验即可显著提升LLM性能，优于GRPO和MIPROv2。


<details>

Motivation: 传统RL方法（如GRPO）需要大量试验来优化LLM，而语言的解释性可能提供更丰富的学习媒介。

Method: GEPA通过自然语言反思诊断问题、提出并测试提示更新，结合Pareto前沿的互补经验。

Result: GEPA在四个任务中平均比GRPO高10%，最多高20%，且试验次数减少35倍；优于MIPROv2 10%以上。

Conclusion: GEPA展示了通过自然语言反思高效优化LLM的潜力，适用于推理时代码优化。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adapted to downstream tasks via
reinforcement learning (RL) methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), which often require thousands of rollouts to learn new tasks. We argue
that the interpretable nature of language can often provide a much richer
learning medium for LLMs, compared with policy gradients derived from sparse,
scalar rewards. To test this, we introduce GEPA (Genetic-Pareto), a prompt
optimizer that thoroughly incorporates natural language reflection to learn
high-level rules from trial and error. Given any AI system containing one or
more LLM prompts, GEPA samples system-level trajectories (e.g., reasoning, tool
calls, and tool outputs) and reflects on them in natural language to diagnose
problems, propose and test prompt updates, and combine complementary lessons
from the Pareto frontier of its own attempts. As a result of GEPA's design, it
can often turn even just a few rollouts into a large quality gain. Across four
tasks, GEPA outperforms GRPO by 10% on average and by up to 20%, while using up
to 35x fewer rollouts. GEPA also outperforms the leading prompt optimizer,
MIPROv2, by over 10% across two LLMs, and demonstrates promising results as an
inference-time search strategy for code optimization.

Result: 框架在显著减少参数量的同时，实现了接近最优的F1分数。

Conclusion: 该方法通过分支微调和动态路由，有效解决了跨数据集分布偏移问题，并实现了参数高效的适应。

Abstract: Lane detection models are often evaluated in a closed-world setting, where
training and testing occur on the same dataset. We observe that, even within
the same domain, cross-dataset distribution shifts can cause severe
catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. To address this, we first train a
base model on a source distribution and then adapt it to each new target
distribution by creating separate branches, fine-tuning only selected
components while keeping the original source branch fixed. Based on a
component-wise analysis, we identify effective fine-tuning strategies for
target distributions that enable parameter-efficient adaptation. At inference
time, we propose using a supervised contrastive learning model to identify the
input distribution and dynamically route it to the corresponding branch. Our
framework achieves near-optimal F1-scores while using significantly fewer
parameters than training separate models for each distribution.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够在不依赖纹理信息的情况下，有效实现人体网格的语义分割。

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud deep learning have led to models that achieve
high per-part labeling accuracy on large-scale point clouds, using only the raw
geometry of unordered point sets. In parallel, the field of human parsing
focuses on predicting body part and clothing/accessory labels from images. This
work aims to bridge these two domains by enabling per-vertex semantic
segmentation of large-scale human meshes. To achieve this, a pseudo-ground
truth labeling pipeline is developed for the Thuman2.1 dataset: meshes are
first aligned to a canonical pose, segmented from multiple viewpoints, and the
resulting point-level labels are then backprojected onto the original mesh to
produce per-point pseudo ground truth annotations. Subsequently, a novel,
memory-efficient sampling strategy is introduced, a windowed iterative farthest
point sampling (FPS) with space-filling curve-based serialization to
effectively downsample the point clouds. This is followed by a purely geometric
segmentation using PointTransformer, enabling semantic parsing of human meshes
without relying on texture information. Experimental results confirm the
effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach.

<details>

Motivation: 现有ML-ADAS依赖低成本摄像头和DNN，但物体检测的安全漏洞可能被利用，影响碰撞避免功能。

Method: 提出ShrinkBox攻击，通过轻微缩小边界框，干扰距离估计，实验基于YOLOv9m和KITTI数据集。

Result: 攻击成功率96%，仅需4%训练数据污染，下游距离估计误差增加3倍以上。

Conclusion: ShrinkBox攻击隐蔽且高效，突显了ML-ADAS安全性的脆弱性。

Abstract: Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) significantly enhance road safety
by detecting potential collisions and alerting drivers. However, their reliance
on expensive sensor technologies such as LiDAR and radar limits accessibility,
particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Machine learning-based ADAS
(ML-ADAS), leveraging deep neural networks (DNNs) with only standard camera
input, offers a cost-effective alternative. Critical to ML-ADAS is the
collision avoidance feature, which requires the ability to detect objects and
estimate their distances accurately. This is achieved with specialized DNNs
like YOLO, which provides real-time object detection, and a lightweight,
detection-wise distance estimation approach that relies on key features
extracted from the detections like bounding box dimensions and size. However,
the robustness of these systems is undermined by security vulnerabilities in
object detectors. In this paper, we introduce ShrinkBox, a novel backdoor
attack targeting object detection in collision avoidance ML-ADAS. Unlike
existing attacks that manipulate object class labels or presence, ShrinkBox
subtly shrinks ground truth bounding boxes. This attack remains undetected in
dataset inspections and standard benchmarks while severely disrupting
downstream distance estimation. We demonstrate that ShrinkBox can be realized
in the YOLOv9m object detector at an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 96%, with
only a 4% poisoning ratio in the training instances of the KITTI dataset.
Furthermore, given the low error targets introduced in our relaxed poisoning
strategy, we find that ShrinkBox increases the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in
downstream distance estimation by more than 3x on poisoned samples, potentially
resulting in delays or prevention of collision warnings altogether.

Motivation: 传统集中式学习存在隐私风险，而分散式方法如联邦学习和群体学习虽保护隐私，但面临数据异质性、通信效率低和灾难性遗忘等问题。

Method: 提出VGS-ATD框架，通过分布式学习在本地节点训练模型，仅共享模型权重，并优化通信和扩展性。

Result: 在30个数据集和80个独立标签的实验中，VGS-ATD准确率达92.7%，优于集中式学习（84.9%）和群体学习（72.99%），且扩展后仅损失1%准确率。

Conclusion: VGS-ATD在隐私保护、效率、扩展性和抗灾难性遗忘方面表现优异，是医疗影像任务的理想解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, advanced deep learning architectures have shown strong
performance in medical imaging tasks. However, the traditional centralized
learning paradigm poses serious privacy risks as all data is collected and
trained on a single server. To mitigate this challenge, decentralized
approaches such as federated learning and swarm learning have emerged, allowing
model training on local nodes while sharing only model weights. While these
methods enhance privacy, they struggle with heterogeneous and imbalanced data
and suffer from inefficiencies due to frequent communication and the
aggregation of weights. More critically, the dynamic and complex nature of
clinical environments demands scalable AI systems capable of continuously
learning from diverse modalities and multilabels. Yet, both centralized and
decentralized models are prone to catastrophic forgetting during system
expansion, often requiring full model retraining to incorporate new data. To
address these limitations, we propose VGS-ATD, a novel distributed learning
framework. To validate VGS-ATD, we evaluate it in experiments spanning 30
datasets and 80 independent labels across distributed nodes, VGS-ATD achieved
an overall accuracy of 92.7%, outperforming centralized learning (84.9%) and
swarm learning (72.99%), while federated learning failed under these conditions
due to high requirements on computational resources. VGS-ATD also demonstrated
strong scalability, with only a 1% drop in accuracy on existing nodes after
expansion, compared to a 20% drop in centralized learning, highlighting its
resilience to catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, it reduced computational
costs by up to 50% relative to both centralized and swarm learning, confirming
its superior efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: Computer vision applications are omnipresent nowadays. The current paper
explores the use of fuzzy logic in computer vision, stressing its role in
handling uncertainty, noise, and imprecision in image data. Fuzzy logic is able
to model gradual transitions and human-like reasoning and provides a promising
approach to computer vision. Fuzzy approaches offer a way to improve object

adaptable and interpretable solutions compared to traditional methods. We
discuss key fuzzy techniques, including fuzzy clustering, fuzzy inference
systems, type-2 fuzzy sets, and fuzzy rule-based decision-making. The paper
also discusses various applications, including medical imaging, autonomous
systems, and industrial inspection. Additionally, we explore the integration of
fuzzy logic with deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) to enhance performance in complex vision tasks. Finally, we examine
emerging trends such as hybrid fuzzy-deep learning models and explainable AI.

Conclusion: 通过结合视觉感知和强化学习，VLMLocPredictor能够以人类方式推理轨迹，为下一位置预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Next Location Prediction is a fundamental task in the study of human
mobility, with wide-ranging applications in transportation planning, urban
governance, and epidemic forecasting. In practice, when humans attempt to
predict the next location in a trajectory, they often visualize the trajectory
on a map and reason based on road connectivity and movement trends. However,
the vast majority of existing next-location prediction models do not reason
over maps \textbf{in the way that humans do}. Fortunately, the recent
development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has demonstrated strong
capabilities in visual perception and even visual reasoning. This opens up a
new possibility: by rendering both the road network and trajectory onto an
image and leveraging the reasoning abilities of VLMs, we can enable models to
perform trajectory inference in a human-like manner. To explore this idea, we
first propose a method called Vision-Guided Location Search (VGLS), which
evaluates whether a general-purpose VLM is capable of trajectory-based
reasoning without modifying any of its internal parameters. Based on insights
from the VGLS results, we further propose our main approach: VLMLocPredictor,
which is composed of two stages: In the first stage, we design two Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) tasks that help the VLM understand road network and
trajectory structures and acquire basic reasoning ability on such visual
inputs. In the second stage, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Visual
Map Feedback, enabling the model to self-improve its next-location prediction
ability through interaction with the environment. Experiments conducted on
datasets from four different cities show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits superior cross-city
generalization compared to other LLM-based approaches.

Conclusion: 基础模型虽简单但稳健，适合作为基准；微调模型在特定任务上有潜力。

Abstract: This project investigates the use of multimodal AI-driven approaches to
automate and enhance suspect sketching. Three pipelines were developed and
evaluated: (1) baseline image-to-image Stable Diffusion model, (2) same model
integrated with a pre-trained CLIP model for text-image alignment, and (3)
novel approach incorporating LoRA fine-tuning of the CLIP model, applied to
self-attention and cross-attention layers, and integrated with Stable
Diffusion. An ablation study confirmed that fine-tuning both self- and
cross-attention layers yielded the best alignment between text descriptions and
sketches. Performance testing revealed that Model 1 achieved the highest
structural similarity (SSIM) of 0.72 and a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of
25 dB, outperforming Model 2 and Model 3. Iterative refinement enhanced
perceptual similarity (LPIPS), with Model 3 showing improvement over Model 2
but still trailing Model 1. Qualitatively, sketches generated by Model 1
demonstrated the clearest facial features, highlighting its robustness as a
baseline despite its simplicity.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了基于CLIP模型的人类动作识别在医疗领域的应用，分析了其在不同掩码策略下的性能，并提出了一种改进方法以提高分类准确性和减少偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类动作识别在医疗领域有重要应用，但传统模型难以泛化复杂动作。CLIP模型提供了新的可能性，但其性能需进一步验证和改进。

Method: 在UCF-101数据集上评估CLIP，采用三种掩码策略（百分比/形状掩码、特征掩码和隔离掩码），并提出通过类特定噪声增强模型性能。

Result: CLIP在视觉线索被遮挡时表现不稳定，改进方法显著提高了分类准确性和模型置信度。

Conclusion: CLIP在医疗领域的应用仍面临挑战，未来需进一步改进模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Human action recognition plays a critical role in healthcare and medicine,
supporting applications such as patient behavior monitoring, fall detection,
surgical robot supervision, and procedural skill assessment. While traditional
models like CNNs and RNNs have achieved moderate success, they often struggle
to generalize across diverse and complex actions. Recent advancements in
vision-language models, especially the transformer-based CLIP model, offer
promising capabilities for generalizing action recognition from video data. In
this work, we evaluate CLIP on the UCF-101 dataset and systematically analyze
its performance under three masking strategies: (1) percentage-based and
shape-based black masking at 10%, 30%, and 50%, (2) feature-specific masking to
suppress bias-inducing elements, and (3) isolation masking that retains only
class-specific regions. Our results reveal that CLIP exhibits inconsistent
behavior and frequent misclassifications, particularly when essential visual
cues are obscured. To overcome these limitations, we propose incorporating
class-specific noise, learned via a custom loss function, to reinforce
attention to class-defining features. This enhancement improves classification
accuracy and model confidence while reducing bias. We conclude with a
discussion on the challenges of applying such models in clinical domains and
outline directions for future work to improve generalizability across
domain-independent healthcare scenarios.

TL;DR: HeartUnloadNet是一种深度学习框架，直接从舒张末期网格预测无负荷左心室形状，结合生物物理先验，显著提高了计算效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无负荷心脏几何形状是心脏生物力学建模的关键参考，但传统逆向有限元方法计算成本高且耗时。

Method: 采用图注意力架构和循环一致性策略，实现双向预测，减少对大数据集的依赖。

Result: 在20,700次有限元模拟中，HeartUnloadNet达到亚毫米精度，推理时间仅0.02秒，比传统方法快10^5倍。

Conclusion: HeartUnloadNet为逆向有限元求解器提供了可扩展且准确的替代方案，支持未来实时临床应用。

Abstract: The unloaded cardiac geometry (i.e., the state of the heart devoid of luminal
pressure) serves as a valuable zero-stress and zero-strain reference and is
critical for personalized biomechanical modeling of cardiac function, to
understand both healthy and diseased physiology and to predict the effects of
cardiac interventions. However, estimating the unloaded geometry from clinical
images remains a challenging task. Traditional approaches rely on inverse
finite element (FE) solvers that require iterative optimization and are
computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce HeartUnloadNet, a deep
learning framework that predicts the unloaded left ventricular (LV) shape
directly from the end diastolic (ED) mesh while explicitly incorporating
biophysical priors. The network accepts a mesh of arbitrary size along with
physiological parameters such as ED pressure, myocardial stiffness scale, and
fiber helix orientation, and outputs the corresponding unloaded mesh. It adopts
a graph attention architecture and employs a cycle-consistency strategy to
enable bidirectional (loading and unloading) prediction, allowing for partial
self-supervision that improves accuracy and reduces the need for large training
datasets. Trained and tested on 20,700 FE simulations across diverse LV
geometries and physiological conditions, HeartUnloadNet achieves sub-millimeter
accuracy, with an average DSC of 0.986 and HD of 0.083 cm, while reducing
inference time to just 0.02 seconds per case, over 10^5 times faster and
significantly more accurate than traditional inverse FE solvers. Ablation
studies confirm the effectiveness of the architecture. Notably, the
cycle-consistent design enables the model to maintain a DSC of 97% even with as
few as 200 training samples. This work thus presents a scalable and accurate
surrogate for inverse FE solvers, supporting real-time clinical applications in
the future.

Motivation: 解决大规模3D数据集稀缺的问题，降低数据收集成本，推动空间智能的发展。

Method: 通过集成深度估计、相机校准和尺度校准，将单视角图像转换为3D表示（如点云、深度图等）。

Conclusion: 该方法为开发能够感知和理解物理环境的AI系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Spatial intelligence is emerging as a transformative frontier in AI, yet it
remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets. Unlike the
abundant 2D imagery, acquiring 3D data typically requires specialized sensors
and laborious annotation. In this work, we present a scalable pipeline that
converts single-view images into comprehensive, scale- and appearance-realistic
3D representations - including point clouds, camera poses, depth maps, and
pseudo-RGBD - via integrated depth estimation, camera calibration, and scale
calibration. Our method bridges the gap between the vast repository of imagery
and the increasing demand for spatial scene understanding. By automatically
generating authentic, scale-aware 3D data from images, we significantly reduce
data collection costs and open new avenues for advancing spatial intelligence.
We release two generated spatial datasets, i.e., COCO-3D and Objects365-v2-3D,
and demonstrate through extensive experiments that our generated data can
benefit various 3D tasks, ranging from fundamental perception to MLLM-based
reasoning. These results validate our pipeline as an effective solution for
developing AI systems capable of perceiving, understanding, and interacting
with physical environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如NeRF和3DGS）在训练和渲染速度上存在限制，且无法支持多传感器评估。SaLF旨在解决这些问题。

Method: SaLF使用稀疏的3D体素基元表示体积，每个体素为局部隐式场，支持快速训练和渲染。

Result: SaLF训练时间短（<30分钟），渲染速度快（相机50+ FPS，LiDAR 600+ FPS），并支持非针孔相机和旋转LiDAR。

Conclusion: SaLF在保持真实感的同时提高了效率和功能，适用于大规模自动驾驶传感器模拟。

Abstract: High-fidelity sensor simulation of light-based sensors such as cameras and
LiDARs is critical for safe and accurate autonomy testing. Neural radiance
field (NeRF)-based methods that reconstruct sensor observations via ray-casting
of implicit representations have demonstrated accurate simulation of driving
scenes, but are slow to train and render, hampering scale. 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated faster training and rendering times through
rasterization, but is primarily restricted to pinhole camera sensors,
preventing usage for realistic multi-sensor autonomy evaluation. Moreover, both
NeRF and 3DGS couple the representation with the rendering procedure (implicit
networks for ray-based evaluation, particles for rasterization), preventing
interoperability, which is key for general usage. In this work, we present
Sparse Local Fields (SaLF), a novel volumetric representation that supports
rasterization and raytracing. SaLF represents volumes as a sparse set of 3D
voxel primitives, where each voxel is a local implicit field. SaLF has fast
training (<30 min) and rendering capabilities (50+ FPS for camera and 600+ FPS
LiDAR), has adaptive pruning and densification to easily handle large scenes,
and can support non-pinhole cameras and spinning LiDARs. We demonstrate that
SaLF has similar realism as existing self-driving sensor simulation methods
while improving efficiency and enhancing capabilities, enabling more scalable
simulation. https://waabi.ai/salf/

Abstract: Optical Music Recognition (OMR) for historical Chinese musical notations,
such as suzipu and l\"ul\"upu, presents unique challenges due to high class
imbalance and limited training data. This paper introduces significant
advancements in OMR for Jiang Kui's influential collection Baishidaoren Gequ
from 1202. In this work, we develop and evaluate a character recognition model
for scarce imbalanced data. We improve upon previous baselines by reducing the
Character Error Rate (CER) from 10.4% to 7.1% for suzipu, despite working with
77 highly imbalanced classes, and achieve a remarkable CER of 0.9% for
l\"ul\"upu. Our models outperform human transcribers, with an average human CER
of 15.9% and a best-case CER of 7.6%. We employ temperature scaling to achieve
a well-calibrated model with an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) below 0.0162.
Using a leave-one-edition-out cross-validation approach, we ensure robust
performance across five historical editions. Additionally, we extend the
KuiSCIMA dataset to include all 109 pieces from Baishidaoren Gequ, encompassing
suzipu, l\"ul\"upu, and jianzipu notations. Our findings advance the
digitization and accessibility of historical Chinese music, promoting cultural
diversity in OMR and expanding its applicability to underrepresented music
traditions.

Motivation: SAR图像缺乏大规模高质量图像-文本数据集，阻碍其语义理解。

Method: 构建SAR-Text数据集（13万对图像-文本），设计SAR-Narrator框架进行多阶段迁移学习生成文本描述。

Result: 在检索、描述和VQA任务中，SAR-RS-CLIP、SAR-RS-CoCa和SAR-GPT模型性能显著提升。

Conclusion: SAR-Text和SAR-Narrator为SAR图像语义理解提供有效工具，可扩展至更大规模数据集。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in the
field of remote sensing in recent years. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
imagery, with its all-weather capability, is essential in remote sensing, yet
the lack of large-scale, high-quality SAR image-text datasets hinders its
semantic understanding. In this paper, we construct SAR-Text, a large-scale and
high-quality dataset consisting of over 130,000 SAR image-text pairs. To
construct the SAR-Text dataset, we design the SAR-Narrator framework, which
generates textual descriptions for SAR images through a multi-stage progressive
transfer learning strategy. To verify the effectiveness of the SAR-TEXT
dataset, we conduct experiments on three typical vision-language tasks:
image-text retrieval, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA).
Specifically, we construct three representative models on SAR-TEXT:
SAR-RS-CLIP, SAR-RS-CoCa, and SAR-GPT. SAR-RS-CLIP achieves notable
improvements in retrieval performance, boosting average recall by 16.43% and
10.54% on the OSdataset-512 and HRSID test sets, respectively. In the
captioning task, SAR-RS-CoCa achieves BLEU-4, SPICE, and CIDEr scores exceeding
those of the original CoCa model by more than 8x, 4x, and 10x, respectively. In
the VQA task, SAR-GPT outperforms baseline and single-stage models on multiple
SAR-VQA datasets, demonstrating stronger semantic understanding and reasoning
ability, as further confirmed by qualitative results. It is worth noting that,
as a flexible captioning tool, SAR-Narrator can be readily adopted by the
community to construct larger-scale SAR image-text datasets.

Conclusion: Human Gaussian Graph通过建模Gaussians与网格的关系，显著提升了动画化人体表示的性能。

Abstract: Modeling animatable human avatars from videos is a long-standing and
challenging problem. While conventional methods require per-instance
optimization, recent feed-forward methods have been proposed to generate 3D
Gaussians with a learnable network. However, these methods predict Gaussians
for each frame independently, without fully capturing the relations of
Gaussians from different timestamps. To address this, we propose Human Gaussian
Graph to model the connection between predicted Gaussians and human SMPL mesh,
so that we can leverage information from all frames to recover an animatable
human representation. Specifically, the Human Gaussian Graph contains dual
layers where Gaussians are the first layer nodes and mesh vertices serve as the
second layer nodes. Based on this structure, we further propose the intra-node
operation to aggregate various Gaussians connected to one mesh vertex, and
inter-node operation to support message passing among mesh node neighbors.
Experimental results on novel view synthesis and novel pose animation
demonstrate the efficiency and generalization of our method.

Result: 在nuScenes和CARLA数据集上验证了方法的有效性，能准确预测多模态可导航走廊。

Conclusion: 提出的方法无需BEV表示，通过图像感知任务实现了高效的自由空间走廊预测。

Abstract: Drivable Free-space prediction is a fundamental and crucial problem in
autonomous driving. Recent works have addressed the problem by representing the
entire non-obstacle road regions as the free-space. In contrast our aim is to
estimate the driving corridors that are a navigable subset of the entire road
region. Unfortunately, existing corridor estimation methods directly assume a
BEV-centric representation, which is hard to obtain. In contrast, we frame
drivable free-space corridor prediction as a pure image perception task, using
only monocular camera input. However such a formulation poses several
challenges as one doesn't have the corresponding data for such free-space
corridor segments in the image. Consequently, we develop a novel
self-supervised approach for free-space sample generation by leveraging future
ego trajectories and front-view camera images, making the process of visual
corridor estimation dependent on the ego trajectory. We then employ a diffusion
process to model the distribution of such segments in the image. However, the
existing binary mask-based representation for a segment poses many limitations.
Therefore, we introduce ContourDiff, a specialized diffusion-based architecture
that denoises over contour points rather than relying on binary mask
representations, enabling structured and interpretable free-space predictions.
We evaluate our approach qualitatively and quantitatively on both nuScenes and
CARLA, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately predicting safe multimodal
navigable corridors in the image.

Conclusion: 注意力机制对提升图像描述性能至关重要，为现代视觉语言任务提供了清晰的架构设计蓝图。

Abstract: Image captioning, a task at the confluence of computer vision and natural
language processing, requires a sophisticated understanding of both visual
scenes and linguistic structure. While modern approaches are dominated by
large-scale Transformer architectures, this paper documents a systematic,
iterative development of foundational image captioning models, progressing from
a simple CNN-LSTM encoder-decoder to a competitive attention-based system. We
present a series of five models, beginning with Genesis and concluding with
Nexus, an advanced model featuring an EfficientNetV2B3 backbone and a dynamic
attention mechanism. Our experiments chart the impact of architectural
enhancements and demonstrate a key finding within the classic CNN-LSTM
paradigm: merely upgrading the visual backbone without a corresponding
attention mechanism can degrade performance, as the single-vector bottleneck
cannot transmit the richer visual detail. This insight validates the
architectural shift to attention. Trained on the MS COCO 2017 dataset, our
final model, Nexus, achieves a BLEU-4 score of 31.4, surpassing several
foundational benchmarks and validating our iterative design process. This work
provides a clear, replicable blueprint for understanding the core architectural
principles that underpin modern vision-language tasks.

Conclusion: 研究挑战了直接图像处理的必要性，展示了基于面部关键点的检测方法在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: The rise of deepfake technology brings forth new questions about the
authenticity of various forms of media found online today. Videos and images
generated by artificial intelligence (AI) have become increasingly more
difficult to differentiate from genuine media, resulting in the need for new
models to detect artificially-generated media. While many models have attempted
to solve this, most focus on direct image processing, adapting a convolutional
neural network (CNN) or a recurrent neural network (RNN) that directly
interacts with the video image data. This paper introduces an approach of using
solely facial landmarks for deepfake detection. Using a dataset consisting of
both deepfake and genuine videos of human faces, this paper describes an
approach for extracting facial landmarks for deepfake detection, focusing on
identifying subtle inconsistencies in facial movements instead of raw image
processing. Experimental results demonstrated that this feature extraction
technique is effective in various neural network models, with the same facial
landmarks tested on three neural network models, with promising performance
metrics indicating its potential for real-world applications. The findings
discussed in this paper include RNN and artificial neural network (ANN) models
with accuracy between 96% and 93%, respectively, with a CNN model hovering
around 78%. This research challenges the assumption that raw image processing
is necessary to identify deepfake videos by presenting a facial feature
extraction approach compatible with various neural network models while
requiring fewer parameters.

Abstract: We introduce the Flow Stochastic Segmentation Network (Flow-SSN), a

modern continuous-time flow variants. We prove fundamental limitations of the
low-rank parameterisation of previous methods and show that Flow-SSNs can
estimate arbitrarily high-rank pixel-wise covariances without assuming the rank
or storing the distributional parameters. Flow-SSNs are also more efficient to
sample from than standard diffusion-based segmentation models, thanks to most
of the model capacity being allocated to learning the base distribution of the
flow, constituting an expressive prior. We apply Flow-SSNs to challenging
medical imaging benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art results. Code

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has advanced WSI analysis but struggles with
the complexity and heterogeneity of WSIs. Existing MIL methods face challenges
in aggregating diverse patch information into robust WSI representations. While
ViTs and clustering-based approaches show promise, they are computationally
intensive and fail to capture task-specific and slide-specific variability. To
address these limitations, we propose PTCMIL, a novel Prompt Token
Clustering-based ViT for MIL aggregation. By introducing learnable prompt
tokens into the ViT backbone, PTCMIL unifies clustering and prediction tasks in
an end-to-end manner. It dynamically aligns clustering with downstream tasks,
using projection-based clustering tailored to each WSI, reducing complexity
while preserving patch heterogeneity. Through token merging and prototype-based
pooling, PTCMIL efficiently captures task-relevant patterns. Extensive
experiments on eight datasets demonstrate its superior performance in
classification and survival analysis tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods. Systematic ablation studies confirm its robustness and strong
interpretability. The code is released at https://github.com/ubc-tea/PTCMIL.

Motivation: 解决传统V-ASR方法因视觉模糊性和数据需求高导致的错误率高的问题。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段输出预测音素，第二阶段用LLM模型（NLLB）重建单词。结合视觉和面部特征。

Result: 在LRS2和LRS3数据集上分别达到17.4%和21.0%的词错误率（WER）。

Conclusion: 提出的PV-ASR方法通过音素和LLM的结合，显著提升了V-ASR的性能。

Abstract: Visual Automatic Speech Recognition (V-ASR) is a challenging task that
involves interpreting spoken language solely from visual information, such as
lip movements and facial expressions. This task is notably challenging due to
the absence of auditory cues and the visual ambiguity of phonemes that exhibit
similar visemes-distinct sounds that appear identical in lip motions. Existing
methods often aim to predict words or characters directly from visual cues, but
they commonly suffer from high error rates due to viseme ambiguity and require
large amounts of pre-training data. We propose a novel phoneme-based two-stage
framework that fuses visual and landmark motion features, followed by an LLM
model for word reconstruction to address these challenges. Stage 1 consists of
V-ASR, which outputs the predicted phonemes, thereby reducing training
complexity. Meanwhile, the facial landmark features address speaker-specific
facial characteristics. Stage 2 comprises an encoder-decoder LLM model, NLLB,
that reconstructs the output phonemes back to words. Besides using a large
visual dataset for deep learning fine-tuning, our PV-ASR method demonstrates
superior performance by achieving 17.4% WER on the LRS2 and 21.0% WER on the
LRS3 dataset.

Abstract: Studying adversarial attacks on point clouds is essential for evaluating and

undefendability by explicitly perturbing the medial axis transform (MAT)
representations, in order to induce inherent adversarialness in the resulting
point clouds. Specifically, we employ an autoencoder to project input point
clouds into compact MAT representations that capture the intrinsic geometric
structure of point clouds. By perturbing these intrinsic representations,
MAT-Adv introduces structural-level adversarial characteristics that remain
effective across diverse models and defense strategies. To mitigate overfitting
and prevent perturbation collapse, we incorporate a dropout strategy into the
optimization of MAT perturbations, further improving transferability and
undefendability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAT-Adv significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both transferability and
undefendability. Codes will be made public upon paper acceptance.

*Bolei Chen,Jiaxu Kang,Haonan Yang,Ping Zhong,Jianxin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过引入3D几何先验来解决2D平面图自定位问题的方法，利用多视图约束和自监督对比学习，显著提升了定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平面图自定位因视觉感知与平面图之间的模态和几何差异而面临挑战，现有方法无法解决频繁视觉变化和遮挡导致的定位误差。

Method: 通过多视图约束建模几何感知的视图不变性，并结合场景表面重建与RGB帧的几何-颜色对应关系，利用自监督对比学习建模3D几何先验。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著优于现有技术，提升了定位成功率且未增加计算负担。

Conclusion: 通过3D几何先验的引入，有效缩小了模态差距并提升了平面图自定位的准确性。

Abstract: Since a building's floorplans are easily accessible, consistent over time,
and inherently robust to changes in visual appearance, self-localization within
the floorplan has attracted researchers' interest. However, since floorplans
are minimalist representations of a building's structure, modal and geometric
differences between visual perceptions and floorplans pose challenges to this
task. While existing methods cleverly utilize 2D geometric features and pose
filters to achieve promising performance, they fail to address the localization
errors caused by frequent visual changes and view occlusions due to variously
shaped 3D objects. To tackle these issues, this paper views the 2D Floorplan
Localization (FLoc) problem from a higher dimension by injecting 3D geometric
priors into the visual FLoc algorithm. For the 3D geometric prior modeling, we
first model geometrically aware view invariance using multi-view constraints,
i.e., leveraging imaging geometric principles to provide matching constraints
between multiple images that see the same points. Then, we further model the
view-scene aligned geometric priors, enhancing the cross-modal geometry-color
correspondences by associating the scene's surface reconstruction with the RGB
frames of the sequence. Both 3D priors are modeled through self-supervised
contrastive learning, thus no additional geometric or semantic annotations are
required. These 3D priors summarized in extensive realistic scenes bridge the
modal gap while improving localization success without increasing the
computational burden on the FLoc algorithm. Sufficient comparative studies
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
and substantially boosts the FLoc accuracy. All data and code will be released
after the anonymous review.

### [62] [Synthetic-to-Real Camouflaged Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18911)
*Zhihao Luo,Luojun Lin,Zheng Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Syn-to-Real Camouflaged Object Detection（S2R-COD）的新任务，通过合成数据集和少量未标注真实图像提升模型性能，并提出了Cycling Syn-to-Real Domain Adaptation Framework（CSRDA）方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据收集和标注成本高，伪装目标检测（COD）的数据集较少，尤其是某些特定类别。合成数据集可以缓解数据不足问题，但直接使用会导致性能下降。

Method: 提出了CSRDA框架，基于师生模型，通过伪标签和一致性正则化将类信息从标注的源域传播到未标注的目标域，并使用循环学习框架缩小域内差距。

Result: 实验表明CSRDA有效缓解了COD中数据不足和手工标注的问题。

Conclusion: CSRDA通过合成与真实数据的结合，显著提升了模型在真实场景中的性能。

Abstract: Due to the high cost of collection and labeling, there are relatively few
datasets for camouflaged object detection (COD). In particular, for certain
specialized categories, the available image dataset is insufficiently
populated. Synthetic datasets can be utilized to alleviate the problem of
limited data to some extent. However, directly training with synthetic datasets
compared to real datasets can lead to a degradation in model performance. To
tackle this problem, in this work, we investigate a new task, namely
Syn-to-Real Camouflaged Object Detection (S2R-COD). In order to improve the
model performance in real world scenarios, a set of annotated synthetic
camouflaged images and a limited number of unannotated real images must be
utilized. We propose the Cycling Syn-to-Real Domain Adaptation Framework
(CSRDA), a method based on the student-teacher model. Specially, CSRDA
propagates class information from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled
target domain through pseudo labeling combined with consistency regularization.
Considering that narrowing the intra-domain gap can improve the quality of
pseudo labeling, CSRDA utilizes a recurrent learning framework to build an
evolving real domain for bridging the source and target domain. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, mitigating the
problem of limited data and handcraft annotations in COD. Our code is publicly

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HQ-SMem是一种基于智能记忆的高质量视频分割与跟踪方法，通过改进分割精度、动态内存管理和外观模型更新，显著提升了视频对象分割（VOS）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VOS模型在精确掩码划分、变形对象处理、长期视频跟踪等方面存在不足，HQ-SMem旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 结合SAM-HQ优化分割掩码边界，动态智能内存机制选择关键帧，动态更新外观模型以应对复杂对象变化。

Result: 在多个公开数据集和基准测试中表现优异，尤其在长期视频和复杂场景中刷新了性能记录。

Conclusion: HQ-SMem通过技术创新有效解决了VOS模型的多个关键限制，为实际应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation (VOS) is foundational to numerous computer vision
applications, including surveillance, autonomous driving, robotics and
generative video editing. However, existing VOS models often struggle with
precise mask delineation, deformable objects, topologically transforming
objects, tracking drift and long video sequences. In this paper, we introduce
HQ-SMem, for High Quality video segmentation and tracking using Smart Memory, a
novel method that enhances the performance of VOS base models by addressing
these limitations. Our approach incorporates three key innovations: (i)
leveraging SAM with High-Quality masks (SAM-HQ) alongside appearance-based
candidate-selection to refine coarse segmentation masks, resulting in improved
object boundaries; (ii) implementing a dynamic smart memory mechanism that
selectively stores relevant key frames while discarding redundant ones, thereby
optimizing memory usage and processing efficiency for long-term videos; and
(iii) dynamically updating the appearance model to effectively handle complex
topological object variations and reduce drift throughout the video. These
contributions mitigate several limitations of existing VOS models including,
coarse segmentations that mix-in background pixels, fixed memory update
schedules, brittleness to drift and occlusions, and prompt ambiguity issues
associated with SAM. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple public
datasets and state-of-the-art base trackers demonstrate that our method
consistently ranks among the top two on VOTS and VOTSt 2024 datasets. Moreover,
HQ-SMem sets new benchmarks on Long Video Dataset and LVOS, showcasing its
effectiveness in challenging scenarios characterized by complex multi-object
dynamics over extended temporal durations.

*Zhentao Huang,Di Wu,Zhenbang He,Minglun Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GSSR提出了一种改进3D高斯分布的方法，通过几何对齐和优化高斯分布，提升场景几何重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯分布方法（如3DGS和PGSR）在几何重建和场景编辑方面存在不足，高斯分布不均匀且偏离潜在表面。

Method: GSSR结合像素级和高斯级的单视角法线一致性及多视角光度一致性，优化高斯分布，并引入不透明度正则化和周期性高斯重新初始化。

Result: 实验表明，GSSR显著提高了几何精度，同时保持了高质量的渲染性能。

Conclusion: GSSR通过改进高斯分布和几何对齐，实现了更精确的场景重建和编辑。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) effectively synthesizes novel views through its
flexible representation, yet fails to accurately reconstruct scene geometry.
While modern variants like PGSR introduce additional losses to ensure proper
depth and normal maps through Gaussian fusion, they still neglect individual
placement optimization. This results in unevenly distributed Gaussians that
deviate from the latent surface, complicating both reconstruction refinement
and scene editing. Motivated by pioneering work on Point Set Surfaces, we
propose Gaussian Set Surface Reconstruction (GSSR), a method designed to
distribute Gaussians evenly along the latent surface while aligning their
dominant normals with the surface normal. GSSR enforces fine-grained geometric
alignment through a combination of pixel-level and Gaussian-level single-view
normal consistency and multi-view photometric consistency, optimizing both
local and global perspectives. To further refine the representation, we
introduce an opacity regularization loss to eliminate redundant Gaussians and
apply periodic depth- and normal-guided Gaussian reinitialization for a
cleaner, more uniform spatial distribution. Our reconstruction results
demonstrate significantly improved geometric precision in Gaussian placement,
enabling intuitive scene editing and efficient generation of novel
Gaussian-based 3D environments. Extensive experiments validate GSSR's
effectiveness, showing enhanced geometric accuracy while preserving
high-quality rendering performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了WiSE-OD方法，通过权重空间集成提升红外图像目标检测的鲁棒性，并引入了两个跨模态OOD基准数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外图像目标检测在低光和夜间应用中至关重要，但缺乏大规模数据集导致模型依赖RGB预训练权重，而微调后鲁棒性不足。

Method: 提出WiSE-OD方法，包括WiSE-OD$_{ZS}$和WiSE-OD$_{LP}$两种变体，通过集成RGB和红外模型的权重提升性能。

Result: WiSE-OD在三种RGB预训练检测器和两种基线模型上验证，显著提升了跨模态和抗干扰鲁棒性。

Conclusion: WiSE-OD无需额外训练或推理成本，有效解决了红外目标检测中的鲁棒性问题。

Abstract: Object detection (OD) in infrared (IR) imagery is critical for low-light and
nighttime applications. However, the scarcity of large-scale IR datasets forces
models to rely on weights pre-trained on RGB images. While fine-tuning on IR
improves accuracy, it often compromises robustness under distribution shifts
due to the inherent modality gap between RGB and IR. To address this, we
introduce LLVIP-C and FLIR-C, two cross-modality out-of-distribution (OOD)
benchmarks built by applying corruption to standard IR datasets. Additionally,
to fully leverage the complementary knowledge from RGB and infrared trained
models, we propose WiSE-OD, a weight-space ensembling method with two variants:
WiSE-OD$_{ZS}$, which combines RGB zero-shot and IR fine-tuned weights, and
WiSE-OD$_{LP}$, which blends zero-shot and linear probing. Evaluated across
three RGB-pretrained detectors and two robust baselines, WiSE-OD improves both
cross-modality and corruption robustness without any additional training or
inference cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合模态搜索（跨图像、文本和多模态文档检索）是重要但未充分探索的实际应用，现有对比视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在此任务中存在模态间隙问题。

Method: 提出GR-CLIP，一种轻量级后校准方法，消除CLIP嵌入空间中的模态间隙。

Result: 在MixBench基准测试中，GR-CLIP将NDCG@10提升26个百分点，优于生成嵌入模型4个百分点，且计算量减少75倍。

Conclusion: GR-CLIP有效解决了模态间隙问题，显著提升了混合模态搜索性能。

Abstract: Mixed modality search -- retrieving information across a heterogeneous corpus
composed of images, texts, and multimodal documents -- is an important yet
underexplored real-world application. In this work, we investigate how
contrastive vision-language models, such as CLIP, perform on the mixed modality
search task. Our analysis reveals a critical limitation: these models exhibit a
pronounced modality gap in the embedding space, where image and text embeddings
form distinct clusters, leading to intra-modal ranking bias and inter-modal
fusion failure. To address this issue, we propose GR-CLIP, a lightweight
post-hoc calibration method that removes the modality gap in CLIP's embedding
space. Evaluated on MixBench -- the first benchmark specifically designed for
mixed modality search -- GR-CLIP improves NDCG@10 by up to 26 percentage points
over CLIP, surpasses recent vision-language generative embedding models by 4
percentage points, while using 75x less compute.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贴纸情感理解依赖多视角信息（如背景知识和风格线索），现有预训练视觉模型在此任务上表现不足。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型生成多视角文本描述，设计层次融合策略和金字塔视觉变换器，结合对比学习和注意力机制，注入文本特征到视觉骨干网络中。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上，MGHFT显著优于现有方法，F1和准确率分别提升5.4%和4.0%。

Conclusion: MGHFT通过多视角文本引导的视觉语义融合，实现了更细粒度的贴纸情感识别，性能显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Although pre-trained visual models with text have demonstrated strong
capabilities in visual feature extraction, sticker emotion understanding
remains challenging due to its reliance on multi-view information, such as
background knowledge and stylistic cues. To address this, we propose a novel
multi-granularity hierarchical fusion transformer (MGHFT), with a multi-view
sticker interpreter based on Multimodal Large Language Models. Specifically,
inspired by the human ability to interpret sticker emotions from multiple
views, we first use Multimodal Large Language Models to interpret stickers by
providing rich textual context via multi-view descriptions. Then, we design a
hierarchical fusion strategy to fuse the textual context into visual
understanding, which builds upon a pyramid visual transformer to extract both
global and local sticker features at multiple stages. Through contrastive
learning and attention mechanisms, textual features are injected at different
stages of the visual backbone, enhancing the fusion of global- and
local-granularity visual semantics with textual guidance. Finally, we introduce
a text-guided fusion attention mechanism to effectively integrate the overall
multimodal features, enhancing semantic understanding. Extensive experiments on
2 public sticker emotion datasets demonstrate that MGHFT significantly
outperforms existing sticker emotion recognition approaches, achieving higher
accuracy and more fine-grained emotion recognition. Compared to the best
pre-trained visual models, our MGHFT also obtains an obvious improvement, 5.4%
on F1 and 4.0% on accuracy. The code is released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像描述评估缺乏标准化标准、偏见意识和用户偏好考量，LOTUS旨在解决这些问题。

Method: LOTUS通过多维度评估（如描述质量、风险和偏见）并结合用户偏好，分析大型视觉语言模型的表现。

Result: 研究发现，没有单一模型在所有标准上表现优异，且描述详细性与偏见风险存在相关性。

Conclusion: LOTUS显示，最佳模型选择取决于用户的具体需求，强调了评估的多维性和用户导向的重要性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have transformed image captioning,
shifting from concise captions to detailed descriptions. We introduce LOTUS, a
leaderboard for evaluating detailed captions, addressing three main gaps in
existing evaluations: lack of standardized criteria, bias-aware assessments,
and user preference considerations. LOTUS comprehensively evaluates various
aspects, including caption quality (e.g., alignment, descriptiveness), risks
(\eg, hallucination), and societal biases (e.g., gender bias) while enabling
preference-oriented evaluations by tailoring criteria to diverse user
preferences. Our analysis of recent LVLMs reveals no single model excels across
all criteria, while correlations emerge between caption detail and bias risks.
Preference-oriented evaluations demonstrate that optimal model selection
depends on user priorities.

Motivation: 解决从非结构化点云中提取有意义的结构信息并转换为语义分布的问题。

Method: 利用扩散模型的新架构和学习策略，通过去噪过程关联源分布和目标分布。

Result: 成功将点云转换为多种结构化输出，如表面关键点、内部稀疏关节和连续特征线。

Conclusion: PDT框架能有效捕捉几何和语义特征，为3D几何处理任务提供强大工具。

Abstract: Point-based representations have consistently played a vital role in
geometric data structures. Most point cloud learning and processing methods
typically leverage the unordered and unconstrained nature to represent the
underlying geometry of 3D shapes. However, how to extract meaningful structural
information from unstructured point cloud distributions and transform them into
semantically meaningful point distributions remains an under-explored problem.
We present PDT, a novel framework for point distribution transformation with
diffusion models. Given a set of input points, PDT learns to transform the
point set from its original geometric distribution into a target distribution
that is semantically meaningful. Our method utilizes diffusion models with
novel architecture and learning strategy, which effectively correlates the
source and the target distribution through a denoising process. Through
extensive experiments, we show that our method successfully transforms input
point clouds into various forms of structured outputs - ranging from
surface-aligned keypoints, and inner sparse joints to continuous feature lines.
The results showcase our framework's ability to capture both geometric and
semantic features, offering a powerful tool for various 3D geometry processing
tasks where structured point distributions are desired. Code will be available

Result: 视觉定位对任务成功至关重要，模块化框架效果显著；任务效率普遍不足，冗余步骤多。

Conclusion: 高效GUI自动化需结合精准定位、任务规划和早期停止策略，基准代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: We introduce MMBench-GUI, a hierarchical benchmark for evaluating GUI
automation agents across Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and Web
platforms. It comprises four levels: GUI Content Understanding, Element
Grounding, Task Automation, and Task Collaboration, covering essential skills
for GUI agents. In addition, we propose a novel Efficiency-Quality Area (EQA)
metric to assess GUI agent execution efficiency in online automation scenarios.
Through MMBench-GUI, we identify accurate visual grounding as a critical
determinant of overall task success, emphasizing the substantial benefits of
modular frameworks that integrate specialized grounding modules. Furthermore,
to achieve reliable GUI automation, an agent requires strong task planning and
cross-platform generalization abilities, with long-context memory, a broad
action space, and long-term reasoning playing a critical role. More important,
task efficiency remains a critically underexplored dimension, and all models
suffer from substantial inefficiencies, with excessive redundant steps even
when tasks are ultimately completed. The integration of precise localization,
effective planning, and early stopping strategies is indispensable to enable
truly efficient and scalable GUI automation. Our benchmark code, evaluation
data, and running environment will be publicly available at

Abstract: Given an object mask, Semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation (SVOS)
technique aims to track and segment the object across video frames, serving as
a fundamental task in computer vision. Although recent memory-based methods
demonstrate potential, they often struggle with scenes involving occlusion,
particularly in handling object interactions and high feature similarity. To
address these issues and meet the real-time processing requirements of
downstream applications, in this paper, we propose a novel bOundary Amendment
video object Segmentation method with Inherent Structure refinement, hereby
named OASIS. Specifically, a lightweight structure refinement module is
proposed to enhance segmentation accuracy. With the fusion of rough edge priors
captured by the Canny filter and stored object features, the module can
generate an object-level structure map and refine the representations by
highlighting boundary features. Evidential learning for uncertainty estimation
is introduced to further address challenges in occluded regions. The proposed
method, OASIS, maintains an efficient design, yet extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks demonstrate its superior performance and competitive
inference speed compared to other state-of-the-art methods, i.e., achieving the
F values of 91.6 (vs. 89.7 on DAVIS-17 validation set) and G values of 86.6

Abstract: Apical periodontitis is a prevalent oral pathology that presents significant
public health challenges. Despite advances in automated diagnostic systems
across various medical fields, the development of Computer-Aided Diagnosis
(CAD) applications for apical periodontitis is still constrained by the lack of
a large-scale, high-quality annotated dataset. To address this issue, we
release a large-scale panoramic radiograph benchmark called "PerioXrays",
comprising 3,673 images and 5,662 meticulously annotated instances of apical
periodontitis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first benchmark
dataset for automated apical periodontitis diagnosis. This paper further
proposes a clinical-oriented apical periodontitis detection (PerioDet)
paradigm, which jointly incorporates Background-Denoising Attention (BDA) and
IoU-Dynamic Calibration (IDC) mechanisms to address the challenges posed by
background noise and small targets in automated detection. Extensive
experiments on the PerioXrays dataset demonstrate the superiority of PerioDet
in advancing automated apical periodontitis detection. Additionally, a
well-designed human-computer collaborative experiment underscores the clinical
applicability of our method as an auxiliary diagnostic tool for professional
dentists.

Abstract: Accurate identification of vehicle attributes such as make, colour, and shape
is critical for law enforcement and intelligence applications. This study
evaluates the effectiveness of three state-of-the-art deep learning approaches
YOLO-v11, YOLO-World, and YOLO-Classification on a real-world vehicle image
dataset. This dataset was collected under challenging and unconstrained
conditions by NSW Police Highway Patrol Vehicles. A multi-view inference (MVI)
approach was deployed to enhance the performance of the models' predictions. To
conduct the analyses, datasets with 100,000 plus images were created for each
of the three metadata prediction tasks, specifically make, shape and colour.
The models were tested on a separate dataset with 29,937 images belonging to
1809 number plates. Different sets of experiments have been investigated by
varying the models sizes. A classification accuracy of 93.70%, 82.86%, 85.19%,
and 94.86% was achieved with the best performing make, shape, colour, and
colour-binary models respectively. It was concluded that there is a need to use
MVI to get usable models within such complex real-world datasets. Our findings
indicated that the object detection models YOLO-v11 and YOLO-World outperformed
classification-only models in make and shape extraction. Moreover, smaller YOLO
variants perform comparably to larger counterparts, offering substantial
efficiency benefits for real-time predictions. This work provides a robust
baseline for extracting vehicle metadata in real-world scenarios. Such models
can be used in filtering and sorting user queries, minimising the time required
to search large vehicle images datasets.

strategies. In this study, we investigated the performance of five cutting-edge
object recognition algorithms, namely YOLO (You Only Look Once) models,
including YOLOv7, YOLOv8, YOLOv9, YOLOv10, and Faster Region-Convolutional
Neural Network (R-CNN), to identify which model was most effective at
recognizing materials in underwater situations. The models were thoroughly
trained and tested on a large dataset containing fifteen different classes
under diverse conditions, such as low visibility and variable depths. From the
above-mentioned models, YOLOv8 outperformed the others, with a mean Average
Precision (mAP) of 80.9%, indicating a significant performance. This increased
performance is attributed to YOLOv8's architecture, which incorporates advanced
features such as improved anchor-free mechanisms and self-supervised learning,
allowing for more precise and efficient recognition of items in a variety of
settings. These findings highlight the YOLOv8 model's potential as an effective
tool in the global fight against pollution, improving both the detection
capabilities and scalability of underwater cleanup operations.

TL;DR: AEDR是一种新型的无训练归因方法，通过双重重建和图像同质性校准提高生成模型图像的溯源准确性，显著优于现有方法。


<details>

Motivation: 生成模型的快速发展带来了安全风险，需要高效准确的图像溯源方法。现有重建归因方法在准确性和计算成本上存在不足。

Method: 提出AEDR方法，利用连续自编码器进行双重重建，并通过重建损失比和图像同质性校准提高准确性。

Result: 在八种潜在扩散模型上，AEDR的归因准确性比现有方法高25.5%，计算时间仅需1%。

Conclusion: AEDR为生成模型图像溯源提供了高效、准确的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of image-generation technologies has made it possible
for anyone to create photorealistic images using generative models, raising
significant security concerns. To mitigate malicious use, tracing the origin of
such images is essential. Reconstruction-based attribution methods offer a
promising solution, but they often suffer from reduced accuracy and high
computational costs when applied to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. To address
these challenges, we propose AEDR (AutoEncoder Double-Reconstruction), a novel
training-free attribution method designed for generative models with continuous
autoencoders. Unlike existing reconstruction-based approaches that rely on the
value of a single reconstruction loss, AEDR performs two consecutive
reconstructions using the model's autoencoder, and adopts the ratio of these
two reconstruction losses as the attribution signal. This signal is further
calibrated using the image homogeneity metric to improve accuracy, which
inherently cancels out absolute biases caused by image complexity, with
autoencoder-based reconstruction ensuring superior computational efficiency.
Experiments on eight top latent diffusion models show that AEDR achieves 25.5%
higher attribution accuracy than existing reconstruction-based methods, while
requiring only 1% of the computational time.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升了点云分析的鲁棒性和适应性，适用于真实场景中的低质量点云数据。

Abstract: Pre-trained point cloud analysis models have shown promising advancements in
various downstream tasks, yet their effectiveness is typically suffering from
low-quality point cloud (i.e., noise and incompleteness), which is a common
issue in real scenarios due to casual object occlusions and unsatisfactory data
collected by 3D sensors. To this end, existing methods focus on enhancing point
cloud quality by developing dedicated denoising and completion models. However,
due to the isolation between the point cloud enhancement and downstream tasks,
these methods fail to work in various real-world domains. In addition, the
conflicting objectives between denoising and completing tasks further limit the
ensemble paradigm to preserve critical geometric features. To tackle the above
challenges, we propose a unified point-level prompting method that reformulates
point cloud denoising and completion as a prompting mechanism, enabling robust
analysis in a parameter-efficient manner. We start by introducing a
Rectification Prompter to adapt to noisy points through the predicted
rectification vector prompts, effectively filtering noise while preserving
intricate geometric features essential for accurate analysis. Sequentially, we
further incorporate a Completion Prompter to generate auxiliary point prompts
based on the rectified point clouds, facilitating their robustness and
adaptability. Finally, a Shape-Aware Unit module is exploited to efficiently
unify and capture the filtered geometric features for the downstream point
cloud analysis.Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the
superiority and robustness of our method when handling noisy and incomplete
point cloud data against existing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is
released at https://github.com/zhoujiahuan1991/ICCV2025-UPP.

TL;DR: GPSMamba框架通过结合语义-频率提示和非因果监督，解决了红外图像超分辨率中因果建模的局限性，实现了全局一致性和细节恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外图像超分辨率因低对比度和稀疏纹理而具有挑战性，需要长程建模以保持全局一致性。

Method: 提出GPSMamba框架，包括自适应语义-频率状态空间模块（ASF-SSM）和热谱注意力与相位一致性损失，以整合非局部上下文并强制全局结构保真。

Result: 实验表明GPSMamba在红外图像恢复中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: GPSMamba为红外图像恢复提供了一种新的有效方法，解决了因果建模的局限性。

Abstract: Infrared Image Super-Resolution (IRSR) is challenged by the low contrast and
sparse textures of infrared data, requiring robust long-range modeling to
maintain global coherence. While State-Space Models like Mamba offer
proficiency in modeling long-range dependencies for this task, their inherent
1D causal scanning mechanism fragments the global context of 2D images,
hindering fine-detail restoration. To address this, we propose Global Phase and
Spectral Prompt-guided Mamba (GPSMamba), a framework that synergizes
architectural guidance with non-causal supervision. First, our Adaptive
Semantic-Frequency State Space Module (ASF-SSM) injects a fused
semantic-frequency prompt directly into the Mamba block, integrating non-local
context to guide reconstruction. Then, a novel Thermal-Spectral Attention and
Phase Consistency Loss provides explicit, non-causal supervision to enforce
global structural and spectral fidelity. By combining these two innovations,
our work presents a systematic strategy to mitigate the limitations of causal
modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GPSMamba achieves
state-of-the-art performance, validating our approach as a powerful new
paradigm for infrared image restoration. Code is available at

Conclusion: 该研究为图像生成技术向更高阶人类审美偏好发展提供了理论和实证支持。

Abstract: Contemporary image generation systems have achieved high fidelity and
superior aesthetic quality beyond basic text-image alignment. However, existing
evaluation frameworks have failed to evolve in parallel. This study reveals
that human preference reward models fine-tuned based on CLIP and BLIP
architectures have inherent flaws: they inappropriately assign low scores to
images with rich details and high aesthetic value, creating a significant
discrepancy with actual human aesthetic preferences. To address this issue, we
design a novel evaluation score, ICT (Image-Contained-Text) score, that
achieves and surpasses the objectives of text-image alignment by assessing the
degree to which images represent textual content. Building upon this
foundation, we further train an HP (High-Preference) score model using solely
the image modality to enhance image aesthetics and detail quality while
maintaining text-image alignment. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
evaluation model improves scoring accuracy by over 10\% compared to existing
methods, and achieves significant results in optimizing state-of-the-art
text-to-image models. This research provides theoretical and empirical support
for evolving image generation technology toward higher-order human aesthetic
preferences. Code is available at https://github.com/BarretBa/ICTHP.

diverse modalities and clinical scenarios. In response, we introduce MedIQA,
the first comprehensive foundation model for medical IQA, designed to handle

developed a large-scale multi-modality dataset with plentiful manually

assessment module to focus on diagnostically relevant regions feature retrieval
and employs an automatic prompt strategy that aligns upstream physical

experiments demonstrate that MedIQA significantly outperforms baselines in
multiple downstream tasks, establishing a scalable framework for medical IQA
and advancing diagnostic workflows and clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm
for integrating visual and textual information, supporting a wide range of
multi-modal tasks. However, these models often suffer from hallucination,
producing content that appears plausible but contradicts the input content or
established world knowledge. This survey offers an in-depth review of
hallucination evaluation benchmarks and detection methods across Image-to-Text
(I2T) and Text-to-image (T2I) generation tasks. Specifically, we first propose
a taxonomy of hallucination based on faithfulness and factuality, incorporating
the common types of hallucinations observed in practice. Then we provide an
overview of existing hallucination evaluation benchmarks for both T2I and I2T
tasks, highlighting their construction process, evaluation objectives, and
employed metrics. Furthermore, we summarize recent advances in hallucination
detection methods, which aims to identify hallucinated content at the instance
level and serve as a practical complement of benchmark-based evaluation.
Finally, we highlight key limitations in current benchmarks and detection
methods, and outline potential directions for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单次联邦学习在医疗领域中的低效率、隐私泄漏和非IID数据收敛问题。

Method: 采用特征引导修正流模型（FG-RF）加速生成建模，并开发双层知识蒸馏（DLKD）方法处理非IID数据。

Result: 在三个非IID医疗数据集上表现优于多轮联邦学习方法，性能提升21.73%，隐私泄漏风险显著降低。

Conclusion: 提出的框架和方法在效率和隐私保护方面表现优异，适用于医疗领域的单次联邦学习。

Abstract: In multi-center scenarios, One-Shot Federated Learning (OSFL) has attracted
increasing attention due to its low communication overhead, requiring only a
single round of transmission. However, existing generative model-based OSFL
methods suffer from low training efficiency and potential privacy leakage in
the healthcare domain. Additionally, achieving convergence within a single
round of model aggregation is challenging under non-Independent and Identically
Distributed (non-IID) data. To address these challenges, in this paper a
modified OSFL framework is proposed, in which a new Feature-Guided Rectified
Flow Model (FG-RF) and Dual-Layer Knowledge Distillation (DLKD) aggregation
method are developed. FG-RF on the client side accelerates generative modeling
in medical imaging scenarios while preserving privacy by synthesizing
feature-level images rather than pixel-level images. To handle non-IID
distributions, DLKD enables the global student model to simultaneously mimic
the output logits and align the intermediate-layer features of client-side
teacher models during aggregation. Experimental results on three non-IID
medical imaging datasets show that our new framework and method outperform
multi-round federated learning approaches, achieving up to 21.73% improvement,
and exceeds the baseline FedISCA by an average of 21.75%. Furthermore, our
experiments demonstrate that feature-level synthetic images significantly
reduce privacy leakage risks compared to pixel-level synthetic images.

Motivation: 预测大脑对多模态自然刺激的反应是计算神经科学的关键挑战，但现有编码模型在新环境中的泛化能力尚未充分验证。

Method: 使用X-CLIP和Whisper提取视觉和听觉特征，构建编码模型，并在ID和OOD数据上评估。

Result: 高容量注意力模型在ID数据上表现优异，但线性模型在OOD数据上更稳健，性能提升18%。语言特征未提升预测准确性。

Conclusion: 严格的OOD测试对构建稳健的神经AI模型至关重要，模型架构、刺激特性和感官层级共同影响多模态世界的神经编码。

Abstract: Predicting brain activity in response to naturalistic, multimodal stimuli is
a key challenge in computational neuroscience. While encoding models are
becoming more powerful, their ability to generalize to truly novel contexts
remains a critical, often untested, question. In this work, we developed brain
encoding models using state-of-the-art visual (X-CLIP) and auditory (Whisper)
feature extractors and rigorously evaluated them on both in-distribution (ID)
and diverse out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our results reveal a fundamental
trade-off between model complexity and generalization: a higher-capacity
attention-based model excelled on ID data, but a simpler linear model was more
robust, outperforming a competitive baseline by 18\% on the OOD set.
Intriguingly, we found that linguistic features did not improve predictive
accuracy, suggesting that for familiar languages, neural encoding may be
dominated by the continuous visual and auditory streams over redundant textual
information. Spatially, our approach showed marked performance gains in the
auditory cortex, underscoring the benefit of high-fidelity speech
representations. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that rigorous OOD
testing is essential for building robust neuro-AI models and provides nuanced
insights into how model architecture, stimulus characteristics, and sensory
hierarchies shape the neural encoding of our rich, multimodal world.

Conclusion: ScenePainter通过语义对齐和动态优化，显著提升了3D场景生成的连贯性和多样性。

Abstract: Perpetual 3D scene generation aims to produce long-range and coherent 3D view
sequences, which is applicable for long-term video synthesis and 3D scene
reconstruction. Existing methods follow a "navigate-and-imagine" fashion and
rely on outpainting for successive view expansion. However, the generated view
sequences suffer from semantic drift issue derived from the accumulated
deviation of the outpainting module. To tackle this challenge, we propose
ScenePainter, a new framework for semantically consistent 3D scene generation,
which aligns the outpainter's scene-specific prior with the comprehension of
the current scene. To be specific, we introduce a hierarchical graph structure
dubbed SceneConceptGraph to construct relations among multi-level scene
concepts, which directs the outpainter for consistent novel views and can be
dynamically refined to enhance diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our framework overcomes the semantic drift issue and generates more
consistent and immersive 3D view sequences. Project Page:

Motivation: 现有的基于Transformer的检测器在小物体检测中仍面临特征金字塔网络的噪声敏感性和标签分配策略中查询质量下降的挑战。

Method: NRQO结合了NT-FPN（通过保留空间和语义信息完整性减少噪声）和PS-RPN（通过位置和形状相似性增强锚点-真实匹配，生成高质量查询）。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，NRQO表现优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: NRQO通过创新的噪声容忍和查询优化策略，显著提升了小物体检测的性能。

Abstract: Despite advancements in Transformer-based detectors for small object
detection (SOD), recent studies show that these detectors still face challenges
due to inherent noise sensitivity in feature pyramid networks (FPN) and
diminished query quality in existing label assignment strategies. In this
paper, we propose a novel Noise-Resilient Query Optimization (NRQO) paradigm,
which innovatively incorporates the Noise-Tolerance Feature Pyramid Network
(NT-FPN) and the Pairwise-Similarity Region Proposal Network (PS-RPN).
Specifically, NT-FPN mitigates noise during feature fusion in FPN by preserving
spatial and semantic information integrity. Unlike existing label assignment
strategies, PS-RPN generates a sufficient number of high-quality positive
queries by enhancing anchor-ground truth matching through position and shape
similarities, without the need for additional hyperparameters. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks consistently demonstrate the superiority of
NRQO over state-of-the-art baselines.

Method: 提出Negation-Aware Test-Time Adaptation (NEAT)方法，通过调整推理过程中的分布相关参数，减少语义分布偏移。

Result: 在多种否定理解任务上的实验验证了NEAT的有效性。

Conclusion: NEAT提供了一种低资源消耗的解决方案，显著提升了VLMs的否定理解能力。

Abstract: In this paper, we study a practical but less-touched problem in
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), \ie, negation understanding. Specifically, many
real-world applications require models to explicitly identify what is false or
non-existent, \eg, radiologists may search for images that exclude specific
conditions. Despite the impressive transferability of VLMs through large-scale
training, they suffer from a critical limitation that fails to handle negation.
To address this challenge, existing methods attribute its root cause to the
scarcity of negation training data and propose to fine-tune VLMs on massive
data containing explicit negation. Undoubtedly, such data-centric solutions
demand substantial data and computational resources, limiting their sustainable
widespread adoption. To tackle negation in a low-carbon manner, we empirically
observe that the key obstacle lies in the dual-concept shifts between the
affirmation and negation distributions. Therefore, we propose a Negation-Aware
Test-Time Adaptation (NEAT) method to efficiently adjust distribution-related
parameters during inference. In brief, NEAT can reduce distribution shift in
consistent semantics while eliminating false distributional consistency in
unrelated semantics. Extensive experiments on the various negation
understanding tasks verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code

Abstract: Decoding stimulus images from fMRI signals has advanced with pre-trained
generative models. However, existing methods struggle with cross-subject
mappings due to cognitive variability and subject-specific differences. This
challenge arises from sequential errors, where unidirectional mappings generate
partially inaccurate representations that, when fed into diffusion models,
accumulate errors and degrade reconstruction fidelity. To address this, we
propose the Bidirectional Autoencoder Intertwining framework for accurate
decoded representation prediction. Our approach unifies multiple subjects
through a Subject Bias Modulation Module while leveraging bidirectional mapping
to better capture data distributions for precise representation prediction. To
further enhance fidelity when decoding representations into stimulus images, we
introduce a Semantic Refinement Module to improve semantic representations and
a Visual Coherence Module to mitigate the effects of inaccurate visual
representations. Integrated with ControlNet and Stable Diffusion, our method
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on benchmark datasets in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Moreover, our framework exhibits
strong adaptability to new subjects with minimal training samples.

Abstract: Radiography imaging protocols target on specific anatomical regions,
resulting in highly consistent images with recurrent structural patterns across
patients. Recent advances in medical anomaly detection have demonstrated the
effectiveness of CNN- and transformer-based approaches. However, CNNs exhibit
limitations in capturing long-range dependencies, while transformers suffer
from quadratic computational complexity. In contrast, Mamba-based models,
leveraging superior long-range modeling, structural feature extraction, and
linear computational efficiency, have emerged as a promising alternative. To
capitalize on the inherent structural regularity of medical images, this study
introduces SP-Mamba, a spatial-perception Mamba framework for unsupervised
medical anomaly detection. The window-sliding prototype learning and
Circular-Hilbert scanning-based Mamba are introduced to better exploit
consistent anatomical patterns and leverage spatial information for medical
anomaly detection. Furthermore, we excavate the concentration and contrast
characteristics of anomaly maps for improving anomaly detection. Extensive
experiments on three diverse medical anomaly detection benchmarks confirm the
proposed method's state-of-the-art performance, validating its efficacy and

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) for dense prediction has shown promising results
but still faces challenges in balancing shared representations with
task-specific specialization. In this paper, we introduce a novel Fine-Grained
Mixture of Experts (FGMoE) architecture that explores MoE-based MTL models
through a combination of three key innovations and fine-tuning. First, we
propose intra-task experts that partition along intermediate hidden dimensions
of MLPs, enabling finer decomposition of task information while maintaining
parameter efficiency. Second, we introduce shared experts that consolidate
common information across different contexts of the same task, reducing
redundancy, and allowing routing experts to focus on unique aspects. Third, we
design a global expert that facilitates adaptive knowledge transfer across
tasks based on both input feature and task requirements, promoting beneficial
information sharing while preventing harmful interference. In addition, we use
the fine-tuning approach to improve parameter efficiency only by training the
parameters of the decoder. Extensive experimental results show that the
proposed FGMoE uses fewer parameters and significantly outperforms current
MoE-based competitive MTL models on two dense prediction datasets

well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, especially in high-stakes clinical
settings. This work presents MedSymmFlow, a generative-discriminative hybrid
model built on Symmetrical Flow Matching, designed to unify classification,
generation, and uncertainty quantification in medical imaging. MedSymmFlow
leverages a latent-space formulation that scales to high-resolution inputs and
introduces a semantic mask conditioning mechanism to enhance diagnostic
relevance. Unlike standard discriminative models, it naturally estimates
uncertainty through its generative sampling process. The model is evaluated on
four MedMNIST datasets, covering a range of modalities and pathologies. The
results show that MedSymmFlow matches or exceeds the performance of established
baselines in classification accuracy and AUC, while also delivering reliable
uncertainty estimates validated by performance improvements under selective
prediction.

TL;DR: LISA是一种层次集成与抑制方法，通过分层调制和多层融合减少多模态大语言模型中的物体幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中表现优异，但容易产生物体幻觉，即描述图像中不存在的物体。为解决这一问题，提出了LISA方法。

Method: LISA利用模型的功能层次结构，通过浅层提供视觉基础、中层编码语义、深层抑制虚假信号。具体包括区域特定频谱调制和基于锚的路由融合。

Result: 实验表明，LISA在CHAIR_I基准上减少幻觉达53.6%，并在POPE F1上提升4.5%，表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: LISA是一种即插即用的方法，能有效减少物体幻觉，提升多模态大语言模型的生成一致性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks such
as image captioning but remain prone to object hallucinations, where they
describe objects that do not appear in the image. To mitigate this, we propose
\textbf{LISA}, a \textbf{L}ayer-wise \textbf{I}ntegration and
\textbf{S}uppression \textbf{A}pproach that enhances generation consistency
through hierarchical modulation and multi-layer fusion. LISA leverages the
functional hierarchy within MLLMs, where shallow layers provide visual
grounding, middle layers encode semantics, and deep layers tend to amplify
spurious signals. First, zone-specific spectral modulation stabilizes attention
by suppressing over-amplified activations in deeper layers while preserving
alignment cues in earlier layers. Second, token-level logits from selected
layers are fused via anchor-based routing, with token-wise anchor selection and
soft logit fusion enabling adaptive integration during decoding. LISA is fully
\textbf{plug-and-play} and can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLMs,
including Qwen2.5-VL. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that LISA reduces
hallucinations by up to 53.6\% in $\mathrm{CHAIR}_I$ and improves POPE F1 by
4.5\%, demonstrating strong generalization across models and tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种跨时空融合机制（CSTF），通过整合多尺度关键点和分类任务改进跨模态遥感图像匹配，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在跨模态遥感图像匹配中因几何和辐射差异导致的特征描述不准确问题。

Method: 结合尺度不变关键点检测和分类任务（SoftMax+FCN），生成对应图并优化相似性匹配。

Result: 在HRSC2016和DOTA数据集上分别达到90.99%和90.86%的mAP，推理速度12.5 FPS。

Conclusion: CSTF机制有效提升跨模态匹配性能，并直接促进下游遥感应用（如目标检测）。

Abstract: Effectively describing features for cross-modal remote sensing image matching
remains a challenging task due to the significant geometric and radiometric
differences between multimodal images. Existing methods primarily extract
features at the fully connected layer but often fail to capture cross-modal
similarities effectively. We propose a Cross Spatial Temporal Fusion (CSTF)
mechanism that enhances feature representation by integrating scale-invariant
keypoints detected independently in both reference and query images. Our
approach improves feature matching in two ways: First, by creating
correspondence maps that leverage information from multiple image regions
simultaneously, and second, by reformulating the similarity matching process as
a classification task using SoftMax and Fully Convolutional Network (FCN)
layers. This dual approach enables CSTF to maintain sensitivity to distinctive
local features while incorporating broader contextual information, resulting in
robust matching across diverse remote sensing modalities. To demonstrate the
practical utility of improved feature matching, we evaluate CSTF on object
detection tasks using the HRSC2016 and DOTA benchmark datasets. Our method
achieves state-of-theart performance with an average mAP of 90.99% on HRSC2016
and 90.86% on DOTA, outperforming existing models. The CSTF model maintains
computational efficiency with an inference speed of 12.5 FPS. These results
validate that our approach to crossmodal feature matching directly enhances
downstream remote sensing applications such as object detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在建模人体运动动态时存在不足，无法平衡局部细节与长时空依赖，且时间表示缺乏与频域的交互。

Method: 将轨迹分解为原始时间序列和频率分量，采用动态补丁分区进行多尺度分割，通过自适应嵌入层和层次特征聚合建模依赖关系，最后通过Transformer编码器-解码器预测轨迹。

Result: 在ETH-UCY、SDD、NBA和JRDB数据集上实现了最先进的性能和高效率。

Conclusion: PatchTraj通过统一时域和频域表示，显著提升了轨迹预测的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving and
robotics. While existing point-based and grid-based methods expose two key
limitations: insufficiently modeling human motion dynamics, as they fail to
balance local motion details with long-range spatiotemporal dependencies, and
the time representation lacks interaction with the frequency domain in modeling
trajectory sequences. To address these challenges, we propose PatchTraj, a
dynamic patch-based trajectory prediction framework that unifies time-domain
and frequency-domain representations. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory
into raw time sequences and frequency components, employing dynamic patch
partitioning for multi-scale trajectory segmentation to capture hierarchical
motion patterns. Each patch is processed by an adaptive embedding layer with
scale-aware feature extraction, followed by hierarchical feature aggregation to
model both fine-grained and long-range dependencies. The outputs of two
branches interact via cross-modal attention, enabling complementary fusion of
temporal and spectral cues. Finally, a Transformer encoder-decoder integrates
both modalities to autoregressively predict future trajectories. Extensive
experiments on ETH-UCY, SDD, NBA, and JRDB datasets demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TopGeoFormer的端到端架构，通过结合拓扑和几何特征，改进了点云的采样和恢复过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以有效利用拓扑和几何属性，导致点云恢复效果不佳。

Method: 1. 使用连续映射提取拓扑嵌入；2. 提出InterTwining Attention融合拓扑和几何特征；3. 引入几何损失和拓扑约束损失优化嵌入。

Result: 在实验中，TopGeoFormer显著优于现有采样和恢复方法。

Conclusion: TopGeoFormer通过结合拓扑和几何特征，提升了点云恢复的效果。

Abstract: Recovering point clouds involves the sequential process of sampling and
restoration, yet existing methods struggle to effectively leverage both
topological and geometric attributes. To address this, we propose an end-to-end
architecture named \textbf{TopGeoFormer}, which maintains these critical
features throughout the sampling and restoration phases. First, we revisit
traditional feature extraction techniques to yield topological embedding using
a continuous mapping of relative relationships between neighboring points, and
integrate it in both phases for preserving the structure of the original space.
Second, we propose the \textbf{InterTwining Attention} to fully merge
topological and geometric embeddings, which queries shape with local awareness
in both phases to form a learnable shape context facilitated with point-wise,
point-shape-wise, and intra-shape features. Third, we introduce a full geometry
loss and a topological constraint loss to optimize the embeddings in both
Euclidean and topological spaces. The geometry loss uses inconsistent matching
between coarse-to-fine generations and targets for reconstructing better
geometric details, and the constraint loss limits embedding variances for
better approximation of the topological space. In experiments, we
comprehensively analyze the circumstances using the conventional and
learning-based sampling/upsampling algorithms. The quantitative and qualitative
results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing sampling
and recovery methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MixA-Q是一种混合精度激活量化框架，利用窗口计算中的稀疏性提升视觉Transformer的推理效率，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过利用窗口激活的稀疏性，优化量化配置，以在模型性能和效率之间取得更好的平衡。

Method: 提出Two-Branch Swin Block，将激活分为高低比特精度处理，兼容QAT和PTQ方法。

Result: 在COCO数据集上，MixA-Q在PTQ配置中实现1.35倍计算加速且无精度损失；QAT配置中实现1.25倍加速（无损失）或1.53倍加速（仅1% mAP下降）。

Conclusion: MixA-Q通过稀疏感知量化适配，显著减少量化误差，提升低比特模型的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose MixA-Q, a mixed-precision activation quantization
framework that leverages intra-layer activation sparsity (a concept widely
explored in activation pruning methods) for efficient inference of quantized
window-based vision transformers. For a given uniform-bit quantization
configuration, MixA-Q separates the batched window computations within Swin
blocks and assigns a lower bit width to the activations of less important
windows, improving the trade-off between model performance and efficiency. We
introduce a Two-Branch Swin Block that processes activations separately in
high- and low-bit precision, enabling seamless integration of our method with
most quantization-aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ)
methods, or with simple modifications. Our experimental evaluations over the
COCO dataset demonstrate that MixA-Q achieves a training-free 1.35x
computational speedup without accuracy loss in PTQ configuration. With QAT,
MixA-Q achieves a lossless 1.25x speedup and a 1.53x speedup with only a 1% mAP
drop by incorporating activation pruning. Notably, by reducing the quantization
error in important regions, our sparsity-aware quantization adaptation improves
the mAP of the quantized W4A4 model (with both weights and activations in 4-bit
precision) by 0.7%, reducing quantization degradation by 24%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有少样本分割方法中，原型学习预测保守，亲和学习预测激进，导致性能受限。本文旨在平衡这两种方法的信息，提升分割效果。

Method: PAHNet结合了原型学习和亲和学习，引入了原型引导特征增强（PFE）模块和注意力分数校准（ASC）模块，以优化支持图像和查询图像的表示。

Result: 实验表明，PAHNet在PASCAL-5$^i$和COCO-20$^i$数据集上的1-shot和5-shot设置中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PAHNet通过平衡保守和激进信息，显著提升了少样本分割的性能，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: This paper studies the few-shot segmentation (FSS) task, which aims to
segment objects belonging to unseen categories in a query image by learning a
model on a small number of well-annotated support samples. Our analysis of two
mainstream FSS paradigms reveals that the predictions made by prototype
learning methods are usually conservative, while those of affinity learning
methods tend to be more aggressive. This observation motivates us to balance
the conservative and aggressive information captured by these two types of FSS
frameworks so as to improve the segmentation performance. To achieve this, we
propose a **P**rototype-**A**ffinity **H**ybrid **Net**work (PAHNet), which
introduces a Prototype-guided Feature Enhancement (PFE) module and an Attention
Score Calibration (ASC) module in each attention block of an affinity learning
model (called affinity learner). These two modules utilize the predictions
generated by a pre-trained prototype learning model (called prototype
predictor) to enhance the foreground information in support and query image
representations and suppress the mismatched foreground-background (FG-BG)
relationships between them, respectively. In this way, the aggressiveness of
the affinity learner can be effectively mitigated, thereby eventually
increasing the segmentation accuracy of our PAHNet method. Experimental results
show that PAHNet outperforms most recently proposed methods across 1-shot and
5-shot settings on both PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets, suggesting its
effectiveness. The code is available at: [GitHub - tianyu-zou/PAHNet: Balancing

TL;DR: DASH提出了一种结合4D哈希编码与自监督分解的动态场景实时渲染框架，解决了现有方法因低秩假设导致的特征重叠和渲染质量差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态场景重建在3D视觉中是一个长期挑战，现有基于平面的方法因低秩假设导致特征重叠和渲染质量差，而直接应用4D哈希编码又会导致哈希冲突和冗余。

Method: DASH采用自监督分解机制分离动态与静态组件，引入多分辨率4D哈希编码器表示动态元素，并提出时空平滑正则化策略以减少不稳定变形伪影。

Result: 实验表明，DASH在真实数据集上实现了实时渲染（264 FPS），并达到最先进的动态渲染性能。

Conclusion: DASH通过结合4D哈希编码与自监督分解，显著提升了动态场景的渲染质量和效率。

Abstract: Dynamic scene reconstruction is a long-term challenge in 3D vision. Existing
plane-based methods in dynamic Gaussian splatting suffer from an unsuitable
low-rank assumption, causing feature overlap and poor rendering quality.
Although 4D hash encoding provides an explicit representation without low-rank
constraints, directly applying it to the entire dynamic scene leads to
substantial hash collisions and redundancy. To address these challenges, we
present DASH, a real-time dynamic scene rendering framework that employs 4D
hash encoding coupled with self-supervised decomposition. Our approach begins
with a self-supervised decomposition mechanism that separates dynamic and
static components without manual annotations or precomputed masks. Next, we
introduce a multiresolution 4D hash encoder for dynamic elements, providing an
explicit representation that avoids the low-rank assumption. Finally, we
present a spatio-temporal smoothness regularization strategy to mitigate
unstable deformation artifacts. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate
that DASH achieves state-of-the-art dynamic rendering performance, exhibiting
enhanced visual quality at real-time speeds of 264 FPS on a single 4090 GPU.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多头自注意力机制在视觉Transformer中性能优异，但计算复杂度高，补丁剪枝是解决此问题的有效方法。

Method: 通过评估多头自注意力权重的方差或中位数绝对偏差来衡量补丁重要性，并引入重叠补丁嵌入。

Result: 在保持分类精度的同时提高了计算效率，且在预训练模型微调场景中表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法计算高效且易于实现，为视觉Transformer的优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multi-head self-attention is a distinctive feature extraction mechanism of
vision transformers that computes pairwise relationships among all input
patches, contributing significantly to their high performance. However, it is
known to incur a quadratic computational complexity with respect to the number
of patches. One promising approach to address this issue is patch pruning,
which improves computational efficiency by identifying and removing redundant
patches. In this work, we propose a patch pruning strategy that evaluates the
importance of each patch based on the variance of attention weights across
multiple attention heads. This approach is inspired by the design of multi-head
self-attention, which aims to capture diverse attention patterns across
different subspaces of feature representations. The proposed method can be
easily applied during both training and inference, and achieves improved
throughput while maintaining classification accuracy in scenarios such as
fine-tuning with pre-trained models. In addition, we also found that using
robust statistical measures, such as the median absolute deviation in place of
variance, to assess patch importance can similarly lead to strong performance.
Furthermore, by introducing overlapping patch embeddings, our method achieves
better performance with comparable throughput to conventional approaches that
utilize all patches.

Result: 在标准数据集上，PSNR、SSIM和感知质量均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在多种天气条件下表现出色，为图像修复提供了统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Restoration of images contaminated by different adverse weather conditions
such as fog, snow, and rain is a challenging task due to the varying nature of
the weather conditions. Most of the existing methods focus on any one
particular weather conditions. However, for applications such as autonomous
driving, a unified model is necessary to perform restoration of corrupted
images due to different weather conditions. We propose a continual learning
approach to propose a unified framework for image restoration. The proposed
framework integrates three key innovations: (1) Selective Kernel Fusion layers
that dynamically combine global and local features for robust adaptive feature
selection; (2) Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) to enable continual learning
and mitigate catastrophic forgetting across multiple restoration tasks; and (3)
a novel Cycle-Contrastive Loss that enhances feature discrimination while
preserving semantic consistency during domain translation. Further, we propose
an unpaired image restoration approach to reduce the dependance of the proposed
approach on the training data. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark
datasets for dehazing, desnowing and deraining tasks demonstrate significant
improvements in PSNR, SSIM, and perceptual quality over the state-of-the-art.

Motivation: 解决现有方法中特征纠缠和几何不一致的问题。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI和SSCBench-KITTI-360上表现优异，超越现有方法。

Conclusion: VisHall3D为自动驾驶等应用提供了更准确可靠的场景理解。

Abstract: This paper introduces VisHall3D, a novel two-stage framework for monocular
semantic scene completion that aims to address the issues of feature
entanglement and geometric inconsistency prevalent in existing methods.
VisHall3D decomposes the scene completion task into two stages: reconstructing
the visible regions (vision) and inferring the invisible regions
(hallucination). In the first stage, VisFrontierNet, a visibility-aware
projection module, is introduced to accurately trace the visual frontier while
preserving fine-grained details. In the second stage, OcclusionMAE, a
hallucination network, is employed to generate plausible geometries for the
invisible regions using a noise injection mechanism. By decoupling scene
completion into these two distinct stages, VisHall3D effectively mitigates
feature entanglement and geometric inconsistency, leading to significantly
improved reconstruction quality.
  The effectiveness of VisHall3D is validated through extensive experiments on
two challenging benchmarks: SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360. VisHall3D
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous methods by a
significant margin and paves the way for more accurate and reliable scene
understanding in autonomous driving and other applications.

Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆生成大量点云数据，但只有部分数据对特定任务（如碰撞检测、交通分析）相关。现有方法在3D点云数据中计数不准确，导致查询结果错误。

Method: 提出CounterNet，通过检测物体中心而非精确定位来提高计数准确性，并采用特征图分区和动态模型选择策略。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，CounterNet将计数准确性提高了5%至20%，显著改善了查询结果的可靠性。

Conclusion: CounterNet通过改进计数准确性，为点云数据查询提供了更可靠的结果。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles generate massive volumes of point cloud data, yet only a
subset is relevant for specific tasks such as collision detection, traffic
analysis, or congestion monitoring. Effectively querying this data is essential
to enable targeted analytics. In this work, we formalize point cloud querying
by defining three core query types: RETRIEVAL, COUNT, and AGGREGATION, each
aligned with distinct analytical scenarios. All these queries rely heavily on
accurate object counts to produce meaningful results, making precise object
counting a critical component of query execution. Prior work has focused on
indexing techniques for 2D video data, assuming detection models provide
accurate counting information. However, when applied to 3D point cloud data,
state-of-the-art detection models often fail to generate reliable object
counts, leading to substantial errors in query results. To address this
limitation, we propose CounterNet, a heatmap-based network designed for
accurate object counting in large-scale point cloud data. Rather than focusing
on accurate object localization, CounterNet detects object presence by finding
object centers to improve counting accuracy. We further enhance its performance
with a feature map partitioning strategy using overlapping regions, enabling
better handling of both small and large objects in complex traffic scenes. To
adapt to varying frame characteristics, we introduce a per-frame dynamic model
selection strategy that selects the most effective configuration for each
input. Evaluations on three real-world autonomous vehicle datasets show that
CounterNet improves counting accuracy by 5% to 20% across object categories,
resulting in more reliable query outcomes across all supported query types.

Result: 在SPA-ADV和其他基准测试中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: SPA-ADV和PRE-MAP为个性化视觉注意力建模提供了新工具，解决了现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: Visual selective attention, driven by individual preferences, regulates human
prioritization of visual stimuli by bridging subjective cognitive mechanisms
with objective visual elements, thereby steering the semantic interpretation
and hierarchical processing of dynamic visual scenes. However, existing models
and datasets predominantly neglect the influence of subjective cognitive
diversity on fixation behavior. Conventional saliency prediction models,
typically employing segmentation approaches, rely on low-resolution imagery to
generate saliency heatmaps, subsequently upscaled to native resolutions, which
limiting their capacity to capture personalized attention patterns.
Furthermore, MLLMs are constrained by factors such as hallucinations, making it
very costly to strictly adhere to the expected format in tasks involving
multiple point predictions, and achieving precise point positioning is
challenging. To address these limitations, we present Subjective Personalized
Attention for Advertisement Videos, namely SPA-ADV, a large-scale multimodal
dataset capturing gaze behaviors from over 4,500 participants varying in age
and gender with 486 videos. Furthermore, we propose PRE-MAP, a novel
eye-tracking saliency model that characterizes Personalized visual disparities
through Reinforcement learning-optimized Eye-tracking, built upon MLLMs and
guided by Multi-Attribute user profiles to predict Points. To ensure MLLMs
produce prediction points that are both format-correct and spatially accurate,
we introduce Consistency Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO), inspired
by the variability in eye movement points and Multi-Attribute profiles.
Extensive experiments on SPA-ADV and other benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. The code and dataset are available at

Conclusion: 该框架首次在大规模和多样性上解决了多人类动态场景生成问题，提供了评估上下文推理的基准。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a framework that creates a lively virtual dynamic
scene with contextual motions of multiple humans. Generating multi-human
contextual motion requires holistic reasoning over dynamic relationships among
human-human and human-scene interactions. We adapt the power of a large
language model (LLM) to digest the contextual complexity within textual input
and convert the task into tangible subproblems such that we can generate
multi-agent behavior beyond the scale that was not considered before.
Specifically, our event generator formulates the temporal progression of a
dynamic scene into a sequence of small events. Each event calls for a
well-defined motion involving relevant characters and objects. Next, we
synthesize the motions of characters at positions sampled based on spatial
guidance. We employ a high-level module to deliver scalable yet comprehensive
context, translating events into relative descriptions that enable the
retrieval of precise coordinates. As the first to address this problem at scale
and with diversity, we offer a benchmark to assess diverse aspects of
contextual reasoning. Benchmark results and user studies show that our
framework effectively captures scene context with high scalability. The code

Abstract: Cooperative perception aims to address the inherent limitations of
single-vehicle autonomous driving systems through information exchange among
multiple agents. Previous research has primarily focused on single-frame
perception tasks. However, the more challenging cooperative sequential
perception tasks, such as cooperative 3D multi-object tracking, have not been
thoroughly investigated. Therefore, we propose CoopTrack, a fully
instance-level end-to-end framework for cooperative tracking, featuring
learnable instance association, which fundamentally differs from existing
approaches. CoopTrack transmits sparse instance-level features that
significantly enhance perception capabilities while maintaining low
transmission costs. Furthermore, the framework comprises two key components:
Multi-Dimensional Feature Extraction, and Cross-Agent Association and
Aggregation, which collectively enable comprehensive instance representation
with semantic and motion features, and adaptive cross-agent association and
fusion based on a feature graph. Experiments on both the V2X-Seq and Griffin
datasets demonstrate that CoopTrack achieves excellent performance.
Specifically, it attains state-of-the-art results on V2X-Seq, with 39.0\% mAP
and 32.8\% AMOTA. The project is available at

### [104] [BridgeNet: A Unified Multimodal Framework for Bridging 2D and 3D Industrial Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19253)
*An Xiang,Zixuan Huang,Xitong Gao,Kejiang Ye,Cheng-zhong Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的多模态异常检测框架，解决了2D和3D信息融合不足的问题，并通过异常生成模拟真实异常样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业异常检测中，仅用2D信息检测3D深度异常不足，且多模态信息差异导致现有方法难以充分表示3D信息。此外，工业数据中异常样本稀缺，需生成异常样本模拟真实场景。

Method: 从3D点云数据提取深度信息，用2D RGB图像表示外观，解耦深度与外观。提出多尺度高斯异常生成器和统一纹理异常生成器，生成丰富的RGB和深度异常。所有模块共享RGB和深度数据的参数。

Result: 在MVTec-3D AD和Eyecandies数据集上表现优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效桥接2D和3D异常检测，无需复杂融合即可利用多模态特征。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection for 2D objects has gained significant attention
and achieved progress in anomaly detection (AD) methods. However, identifying
3D depth anomalies using only 2D information is insufficient. Despite
explicitly fusing depth information into RGB images or using point cloud
backbone networks to extract depth features, both approaches struggle to
adequately represent 3D information in multimodal scenarios due to the
disparities among different modal information. Additionally, due to the
scarcity of abnormal samples in industrial data, especially in multimodal
scenarios, it is necessary to perform anomaly generation to simulate real-world
abnormal samples. Therefore, we propose a novel unified multimodal anomaly
detection framework to address these issues. Our contributions consist of 3 key
aspects. (1) We extract visible depth information from 3D point cloud data
simply and use 2D RGB images to represent appearance, which disentangles depth
and appearance to support unified anomaly generation. (2) Benefiting from the
flexible input representation, the proposed Multi-Scale Gaussian Anomaly
Generator and Unified Texture Anomaly Generator can generate richer anomalies
in RGB and depth. (3) All modules share parameters for both RGB and depth data,
effectively bridging 2D and 3D anomaly detection. Subsequent modules can
directly leverage features from both modalities without complex fusion.
Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) on MVTec-3D AD
and Eyecandies datasets. Code available at:

TL;DR: OV-Fact是一种新方法，用于评估长描述的事实性，无需依赖人工标注，结合开放词汇视觉定位和工具验证，提升与人类判断的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的事实性和幻觉评估方法不适用于长且多样的描述，尤其是在缺乏人工标注的情况下。

Method: 利用开放词汇视觉定位和工具验证，设计了一种无需参考的方法来评估描述的事实性。

Result: OV-Fact在减少噪声数据的同时，显著提升了描述的事实性精度，且不牺牲描述的丰富性。

Conclusion: OV-Fact为长描述的事实性评估提供了有效工具，并可用于数据过滤，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle to generate long and
factual captions. However, traditional measures for hallucination and
factuality are not well suited for evaluating longer, more diverse captions and
in settings where ground-truth human-annotated captions are unavailable. We
introduce OV-Fact, a novel method for measuring caption factuality of long
captions that leverages open-vocabulary visual grounding and tool-based
verification without depending on human annotations. Our method improves
agreement with human judgments and captures both caption descriptiveness
(recall) and factual precision in the same metric. Furthermore, unlike previous
metrics, our reference-free method design enables new applications towards
factuality-based data filtering. We observe models trained on an
OVFact-filtered (2.5-5x less) subset of a large-scale, noisy (VLM-generated)
pretraining set meaningfully improve factuality precision without sacrificing
caption descriptiveness across a range of downstream long caption benchmarks.

*Sijie Li,Chen Chen,Jungong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SimMLM是一个简单而强大的多模态学习框架，适用于模态缺失场景，通过动态专家混合架构和MoFe排名损失提升准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖复杂网络架构或数据填补技术，SimMLM旨在提供通用且高效的解决方案，适应各种模态缺失情况。

Method: 采用动态模态专家混合架构（DMoME）和MoFe排名损失，动态调整模态贡献并确保任务准确性随模态增加而稳定或提升。

Result: 在医学图像分割和多模态分类任务中，SimMLM表现优于竞争方法，准确性和鲁棒性显著提升。

Conclusion: SimMLM在多模态学习中表现出色，尤其在模态缺失场景下具有优越性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose SimMLM, a simple yet powerful framework for
multimodal learning with missing modalities. Unlike existing approaches that
rely on sophisticated network architectures or complex data imputation
techniques, SimMLM provides a generic and effective solution that can adapt to
various missing modality scenarios with improved accuracy and robustness.
Specifically, SimMLM consists of a generic Dynamic Mixture of Modality Experts
(DMoME) architecture, featuring a dynamic, learnable gating mechanism that
automatically adjusts each modality's contribution in both full and partial
modality settings. A key innovation of SimMLM is the proposed More vs. Fewer
(MoFe) ranking loss, which ensures that task accuracy improves or remains
stable as more modalities are made available. This aligns the model with an
intuitive principle: removing one or more modalities should not increase
accuracy. We validate SimMLM on multimodal medical image segmentation (BraTS
2018) and multimodal classification (UPMC Food-101, avMNIST) tasks, where it
consistently surpasses competitive methods, demonstrating superior accuracy,
interpretability, robustness, and reliability across both complete and missing
modality scenarios at test time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法主要基于静态图像，忽略了视频中的时间线索，限制了特征的几何感知能力。

Method: 通过训练单图像编码器预测下一帧表示，注入3D空间和时间先验，无需复杂的光流或跟踪。

Result: 在ADE20K数据集上，mIoU从35.0提升至36.4，同时保持与图像管道的兼容性。

Conclusion: 视频自蒸馏是一种轻量级方法，可增强几何感知能力，为物理AI和世界模型提供支持。

Abstract: Self-supervised image encoders such as DINO have recently gained significant
interest for learning robust visual features without labels. However, most SSL
methods train on static images and miss the temporal cues inherent in videos.
We introduce a video-distilled single-image encoder trained to predict the
next-frame representation from the current frame. This simple objective injects
3D spatial and temporal priors without optical flow or tracking. When
pre-training on a single 2-hour video, our approach raises the mean
Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) on ADE20K from 35.0 (DoRA) to 36.4 while
remaining a drop-in replacement for image-only pipelines. Our results highlight
video self-distillation as a lightweight route to geometry-aware perception an
essential ingredient for physically plausible world models and Physical AI.

Motivation: 现有遥感方法依赖监督微调，限制了推理的自主性，无法满足复杂查询和上下文关系的需求。

Method: 结合多模态大语言模型（MLLM）和强化学习（RL），设计任务适应策略以支持多粒度输出。

Result: RemoteReasoner在多粒度推理任务（如区域级和像素级）中表现优异，并能实现现有方法无法完成的轮廓提取任务。

Conclusion: RemoteReasoner通过自主推理和灵活架构，显著提升了遥感图像复杂查询的处理能力。

Abstract: Remote sensing imagery presents vast, inherently unstructured spatial data,
demanding sophisticated reasoning to interpret complex user intents and
contextual relationships beyond simple recognition tasks. In this paper, we aim
to construct an Earth observation workflow to handle complex queries by
reasoning about spatial context and user intent. As a reasoning workflow, it
should be somewhat autonomous, where predefined ground-truth reasoning paths do
not constrain the learning process. Furthermore, its architecture ought to be
unified yet flexible, enabling the model to perform diverse reasoning tasks
with distinct output formats through a single forward pass. Existing remote
sensing approaches fail to address these requirements, as they rely on
supervised fine-tuning paradigms that constrain the autonomy of reasoning. To
this end, we propose RemoteReasoner, a flexible and robust workflow for remote
sensing reasoning tasks. The design of RemoteReasoner integrates a multi-modal
large language model (MLLM) for interpreting user instructions and localizing
targets, together with task adaptation strategies that enable multi-granularity
output generation. In contrast to existing methods, our framework is trained
with reinforcement learning (RL) to endow the MLLM sufficient autonomy for
precise reasoning. At the inference stage, our adaptation strategies enable
diverse output formats at inference time without requiring task-specific
decoders or further fine-tuning. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that
RemoteReasoner achieves remarkable performance across multi-granularity
reasoning tasks, including region-level and pixel-level. Additionally, our
framework enables novel capabilities such as the contour extraction task beyond
the reach of existing reasoning pipelines.

Conclusion: PINO为群体交互生成提供了高效、可控的解决方案。

Abstract: Generating realistic group interactions involving multiple characters remains
challenging due to increasing complexity as group size expands. While existing
conditional diffusion models incrementally generate motions by conditioning on
previously generated characters, they rely on single shared prompts, limiting
nuanced control and leading to overly simplified interactions. In this paper,
we introduce Person-Interaction Noise Optimization (PINO), a novel,
training-free framework designed for generating realistic and customizable
interactions among groups of arbitrary size. PINO decomposes complex group
interactions into semantically relevant pairwise interactions, and leverages
pretrained two-person interaction diffusion models to incrementally compose
group interactions. To ensure physical plausibility and avoid common artifacts
such as overlapping or penetration between characters, PINO employs
physics-based penalties during noise optimization. This approach allows precise
user control over character orientation, speed, and spatial relationships
without additional training. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that PINO
generates visually realistic, physically coherent, and adaptable multi-person
interactions suitable for diverse animation, gaming, and robotics applications.

Motivation: 手动血细胞检测耗时、低效且易出错，深度学习目标检测可提供高效解决方案。

Method: 改进YOLOX，引入CBAM增强特征提取，ASFF优化特征融合，CIOU损失函数加速收敛。

Result: 在BCCD数据集上，ABCD方法mAP@0.5达95.49%，mAP@0.5-0.9达86.89%，检测速度提升2.9%。

Conclusion: ABCD方法高效且适用于实时应用，显著优于基线算法。

Abstract: Detection of blood cells in microscopic images has become a major focus of
medical image analysis, playing a crucial role in gaining valuable insights
into a patient's health. Manual blood cell checks for disease detection are
known to be time-consuming, inefficient, and error-prone. To address these
limitations, analyzing blood cells using deep learning-based object detectors
can be regarded as a feasible solution. In this study, we propose automatic
blood cell detection method (ABCD) based on an improved version of YOLOX, an
object detector, for detecting various types of blood cells, including white
blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Firstly, we introduce the
Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) into the network's backbone to
enhance the efficiency of feature extraction. Furthermore, we introduce the
Adaptively Spatial Feature Fusion (ASFF) into the network's neck, which
optimizes the fusion of different features extracted from various stages of the
network. Finally, to speed up the model's convergence, we substitute the
Intersection over Union (IOU) loss function with the Complete Intersection over
Union (CIOU) loss function. The experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method is more effective than other existing methods for BCCD dataset.
Compared to the baseline algorithm, our method ABCD achieved 95.49 % mAP@0.5
and 86.89 % mAP@0.5-0.9, which are 2.8% and 23.41% higher, respectively, and
increased the detection speed by 2.9%, making it highly efficient for real-time
applications.

Result: 在KITTI基准测试中实现了新的最优或极具竞争力的结果，同时保持了高效性。

Conclusion: MuStD网络通过多模态特征融合显著提升了3D物体检测性能，为未来研究提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Fusion of LiDAR and RGB data has the potential to enhance outdoor 3D object
detection accuracy. To address real-world challenges in outdoor 3D object
detection, fusion of LiDAR and RGB input has started gaining traction. However,
effective integration of these modalities for precise object detection task
still remains a largely open problem. To address that, we propose a MultiStream
Detection (MuStD) network, that meticulously extracts task-relevant information
from both data modalities. The network follows a three-stream structure. Its
LiDAR-PillarNet stream extracts sparse 2D pillar features from the LiDAR input
while the LiDAR-Height Compression stream computes Bird's-Eye View features. An
additional 3D Multimodal stream combines RGB and LiDAR features using UV
mapping and polar coordinate indexing. Eventually, the features containing
comprehensive spatial, textural and geometric information are carefully fused
and fed to a detection head for 3D object detection. Our extensive evaluation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在医疗影像和自动驾驶等高风险领域缺乏透明度，原型部分模型提供了概念级解释，但现有方法要么限于细粒度任务，要么解释复杂。

Method: SIDE采用稀疏训练和剪枝方案，结合Sigmoid激活函数，使每个类别仅关联少量相关原型。

Result: 实验表明，SIDE在保持准确性的同时，将解释规模减少90%以上。

Conclusion: SIDE显著提升了原型解释的可理解性，适用于大规模数据集。

Abstract: Understanding the decisions made by deep neural networks is essential in
high-stakes domains such as medical imaging and autonomous driving. Yet, these
models often lack transparency, particularly in computer vision.
Prototypical-parts-based neural networks have emerged as a promising solution
by offering concept-level explanations. However, most are limited to
fine-grained classification tasks, with few exceptions such as InfoDisent.
InfoDisent extends prototypical models to large-scale datasets like ImageNet,
but produces complex explanations.
  We introduce Sparse Information Disentanglement for Explainability (SIDE), a
novel method that improves the interpretability of prototypical parts through a
dedicated training and pruning scheme that enforces sparsity. Combined with
sigmoid activations in place of softmax, this approach allows SIDE to associate
each class with only a small set of relevant prototypes. Extensive experiments
show that SIDE matches the accuracy of existing methods while reducing
explanation size by over $90\%$, substantially enhancing the understandability
of prototype-based explanations.

Motivation: 解决车辆间通信中因传输原始点云或完整特征图导致的延迟和可扩展性问题。

Method: 采用两阶段减少管道：选择性传输（ST）修剪低效用区域，自适应网格减少（AGR）通过GNN分配车辆特定的保留比例。剩余特征通过软门控MoE注意力层融合。

Result: 在OPV2V基准测试中，EffiComm达到0.84 mAP@0.7，每帧仅传输约1.5 MB数据，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EffiComm展示了自适应学习通信在可扩展V2X感知中的价值。

Abstract: Collaborative perception allows connected vehicles to exchange sensor
information and overcome each vehicle's blind spots. Yet transmitting raw point
clouds or full feature maps overwhelms Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications,
causing latency and scalability problems. We introduce EffiComm, an end-to-end
framework that transmits less than 40% of the data required by prior art while
maintaining state-of-the-art 3D object detection accuracy. EffiComm operates on
Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) feature maps from any modality and applies a two-stage
reduction pipeline: (1) Selective Transmission (ST) prunes low-utility regions
with a confidence mask; (2) Adaptive Grid Reduction (AGR) uses a Graph Neural
Network (GNN) to assign vehicle-specific keep ratios according to role and
network load. The remaining features are fused with a soft-gated
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) attention layer, offering greater capacity and
specialization for effective feature integration. On the OPV2V benchmark,
EffiComm reaches 0.84 mAP@0.7 while sending only an average of approximately
1.5 MB per frame, outperforming previous methods on the accuracy-per-bit curve.
These results highlight the value of adaptive, learned communication for
scalable Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) perception.

Abstract: Creating a virtual avatar with semantically coherent gestures that are
aligned with speech is a challenging task. Existing gesture generation research
mainly focused on generating rhythmic beat gestures, neglecting the semantic
context of the gestures. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for
semantic grounding in co-speech gesture generation that integrates semantic
information at both fine-grained and global levels. Our approach starts with
learning the motion prior through a vector-quantized variational autoencoder.
Built on this model, a second-stage module is applied to automatically generate
gestures from speech, text-based semantics and speaker identity that ensures
consistency between the semantic relevance of generated gestures and
co-occurring speech semantics through semantic coherence and relevance modules.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enhances the realism and
coherence of semantic gestures. Extensive experiments and user studies show
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across two benchmarks
in co-speech gesture generation in both objective and subjective metrics. The
qualitative results of our model, code, dataset and pre-trained models can be

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证了EA-ViT的有效性和多功能性。

Conclusion: EA-ViT提供了一种高效且灵活的ViT适应方案，适用于多样化资源约束场景。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a foundational model in computer
vision, excelling in generalization and adaptation to downstream tasks.
However, deploying ViTs to support diverse resource constraints typically
requires retraining multiple, size-specific ViTs, which is both time-consuming
and energy-intensive. To address this issue, we propose an efficient ViT
adaptation framework that enables a single adaptation process to generate
multiple models of varying sizes for deployment on platforms with various
resource constraints. Our approach comprises two stages. In the first stage, we
enhance a pre-trained ViT with a nested elastic architecture that enables
structural flexibility across MLP expansion ratio, number of attention heads,
embedding dimension, and network depth. To preserve pre-trained knowledge and
ensure stable adaptation, we adopt a curriculum-based training strategy that
progressively increases elasticity. In the second stage, we design a
lightweight router to select submodels according to computational budgets and
downstream task demands. Initialized with Pareto-optimal configurations derived
via a customized NSGA-II algorithm, the router is then jointly optimized with
the backbone. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and versatility of EA-ViT. The code is available at

Abstract: Autonomous driving technology has the potential to transform transportation,
but its wide adoption depends on the development of interpretable and
transparent decision-making systems. Scene captioning, which generates natural
language descriptions of the driving environment, plays a crucial role in
enhancing transparency, safety, and human-AI interaction. We introduce BEV-LLM,
a lightweight model for 3D captioning of autonomous driving scenes. BEV-LLM
leverages BEVFusion to combine 3D LiDAR point clouds and multi-view images,
incorporating a novel absolute positional encoding for view-specific scene
descriptions. Despite using a small 1B parameter base model, BEV-LLM achieves
competitive performance on the nuCaption dataset, surpassing state-of-the-art
by up to 5\% in BLEU scores. Additionally, we release two new datasets - nuView
(focused on environmental conditions and viewpoints) and GroundView (focused on
object grounding) - to better assess scene captioning across diverse driving
scenarios and address gaps in current benchmarks, along with initial
benchmarking results demonstrating their effectiveness.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了长尾类别的识别准确率，为CXR诊断提供了更可靠的模型。

Abstract: Chest radiography (CXR) plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of various
diseases. However, the inherent class imbalance in the distribution of clinical
findings presents a significant challenge for current self-supervised deep
learning models. These models often fail to accurately classify long-tailed
classes. Current Vision-Language models such as Contrastive Language Image
Pre-training (CLIP) models effectively model the manifold distribution of the
latent space, enabling high zero-shot classification accuracies. Although CLIP
performs well on most of the primary classes in the dataset, our work reveals
that its effectiveness decreases significantly for classes with a long-tailed
distribution. Our approach employs a class-weighting mechanism that directly
aligns with the distribution of classes within the latent space. This method
ensures a substantial improvement in overall classification performance, with
particular emphasis on enhancing the recognition and accuracy of rarely
observed classes. We accomplish this by applying Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
clustering to the latent space. The subsequent clusters are further refined by
Student t-distribution, followed by a metric loss that utilizes the altered
embeddings. Our approach facilitates stable and adaptive clustering of the
features. This results in a notable average improvement of 7\% points in
zero-shot AUC scores across 40 classes in the MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset from
previous SOTA models.

surmised to rely on techniques such as attention/model parallelism, as well as
hardware-level optimizations. While these strategies allow input lengths to
scale to millions of tokens, they do not fundamentally mitigate the quadratic
computational and memory complexity of the core attention mechanism. In this
paper, we address the challenge of long-context processing on a single device
using generic implementations by reducing the quadratic memory footprint and
inference cost. Existing approaches to extend the context length for generic
single device implementations -- such as token merging and modified attentions
-- are often modality specific and attain a suboptimal tradeoff between
accuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose MAELRE
(Modality Agnostic Efficient Long Range Encoder), a unified and efficient
transformer architecture designed for long-range encoding across diverse
modalities. MAELRE integrates token merging with attention approximation,
progressively merging tokens at different stages of internal computational
blocks. It employs a lightweight attention approximation when the number of
tokens is large, and switches to standard dot-product attention as the sequence
becomes shorter through successive aggregation. We demonstrate that MAELRE
achieves superior accuracy while reducing computational cost compared to
existing long-context models on classification tasks spanning multiple
modalities, including text, time series, audio, and vision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多任务的深度证据融合网络（DEFNet），通过场景和失真类型分类任务优化盲图像质量评估（BIQA），并设计了可信信息融合策略和不确定性估计技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有BIQA方法因集成不足和缺乏灵活的不确定性估计导致性能不佳。

Method: DEFNet结合多任务优化，采用局部-全局信息融合策略，并利用正态-逆伽马分布混合进行不确定性估计。

Result: 在合成和真实失真数据集上的实验验证了框架的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DEFNet具有强泛化能力和对未知场景的适应性。

Abstract: Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) methods often incorporate auxiliary
tasks to improve performance. However, existing approaches face limitations due
to insufficient integration and a lack of flexible uncertainty estimation,
leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose a
multitasks-based Deep Evidential Fusion Network (DEFNet) for BIQA, which
performs multitask optimization with the assistance of scene and distortion
type classification tasks. To achieve a more robust and reliable
representation, we design a novel trustworthy information fusion strategy. It
first combines diverse features and patterns across sub-regions to enhance
information richness, and then performs local-global information fusion by
balancing fine-grained details with coarse-grained context. Moreover, DEFNet
exploits advanced uncertainty estimation technique inspired by evidential
learning with the help of normal-inverse gamma distribution mixture. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and authentic distortion datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework. Additional evaluation
and analysis are carried out to highlight its strong generalization capability
and adaptability to previously unseen scenarios.

Conclusion: 研究为LVLMs的时空语义分析提供了机制性见解，为设计更鲁棒和可解释的模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: The processing mechanisms underlying language and image understanding in
large vision-language models (LVLMs) have been extensively studied. However,
the internal reasoning mechanisms of LVLMs for spatiotemporal understanding
remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a systematic,
circuit-based framework designed to investigate how spatiotemporal visual
semantics are represented and processed within these LVLMs. Specifically, our
framework comprises three circuits: visual auditing circuit, semantic tracing
circuit, and attention flow circuit. Through the lens of these circuits, we
discover that visual semantics are highly localized to specific object
tokens--removing these tokens can degrade model performance by up to 92.6%.
Furthermore, we identify that interpretable concepts of objects and actions
emerge and become progressively refined in the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs.
In contrary to the current works that solely focus on objects in one image, we
reveal that the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs exhibit specialized functional
localization for spatiotemporal semantics. Our findings offer significant
mechanistic insights into spatiotemporal semantics analysis of LVLMs, laying a
foundation for designing more robust and interpretable models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖LiDAR标注，限制了可扩展性和利用众包数据进行自动标注的潜力。

Method: GS-Occ3D采用Octree高斯曲面优化显式占用表示，并将场景分解为静态背景、地面和动态物体，分别建模。

Result: 在Waymo数据集上实现了最先进的几何重建效果，并在Occ3D-Waymo和Occ3D-nuScenes上展示了卓越的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: GS-Occ3D展示了大规模基于视觉的占用重建作为自动驾驶感知新范式的潜力。

Abstract: Occupancy is crucial for autonomous driving, providing essential geometric
priors for perception and planning. However, existing methods predominantly
rely on LiDAR-based occupancy annotations, which limits scalability and
prevents leveraging vast amounts of potential crowdsourced data for
auto-labeling. To address this, we propose GS-Occ3D, a scalable vision-only
framework that directly reconstructs occupancy. Vision-only occupancy
reconstruction poses significant challenges due to sparse viewpoints, dynamic
scene elements, severe occlusions, and long-horizon motion. Existing
vision-based methods primarily rely on mesh representation, which suffer from
incomplete geometry and additional post-processing, limiting scalability. To
overcome these issues, GS-Occ3D optimizes an explicit occupancy representation
using an Octree-based Gaussian Surfel formulation, ensuring efficiency and
scalability. Additionally, we decompose scenes into static background, ground,
and dynamic objects, enabling tailored modeling strategies: (1) Ground is
explicitly reconstructed as a dominant structural element, significantly
improving large-area consistency; (2) Dynamic vehicles are separately modeled
to better capture motion-related occupancy patterns. Extensive experiments on
the Waymo dataset demonstrate that GS-Occ3D achieves state-of-the-art geometry
reconstruction results. By curating vision-only binary occupancy labels from
diverse urban scenes, we show their effectiveness for downstream occupancy
models on Occ3D-Waymo and superior zero-shot generalization on Occ3D-nuScenes.
It highlights the potential of large-scale vision-based occupancy
reconstruction as a new paradigm for autonomous driving perception. Project

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于CNN的3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）初始化和训练方法，解决了传统方法需要精确姿态和高计算成本的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D建模方法（如NeRF和3DGS）需要精确的姿态信息且计算成本高，限制了其在空间应用中的使用。

Method: 使用CNN从单目图像生成粗略3D模型和姿态估计，用于初始化3DGS，并支持噪声或隐式姿态训练。

Result: 显著减少了训练迭代次数和输入图像需求（至少一个数量级），并在不完美姿态下仍能学习高保真3D表示。

Conclusion: 该方法为空间应用中的新型视图合成技术提供了可行性。

Abstract: The advent of novel view synthesis techniques such as NeRF and 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) has enabled learning precise 3D models only from posed
monocular images. Although these methods are attractive, they hold two major
limitations that prevent their use in space applications: they require poses
during training, and have high computational cost at training and inference. To
address these limitations, this work contributes: (1) a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) based primitive initializer for 3DGS using monocular images; (2)
a pipeline capable of training with noisy or implicit pose estimates; and (3)
and analysis of initialization variants that reduce the training cost of
precise 3D models. A CNN takes a single image as input and outputs a coarse 3D
model represented as an assembly of primitives, along with the target's pose
relative to the camera. This assembly of primitives is then used to initialize
3DGS, significantly reducing the number of training iterations and input images
needed -- by at least an order of magnitude. For additional flexibility, the
CNN component has multiple variants with different pose estimation techniques.
This work performs a comparison between these variants, evaluating their
effectiveness for downstream 3DGS training under noisy or implicit pose
estimates. The results demonstrate that even with imperfect pose supervision,
the pipeline is able to learn high-fidelity 3D representations, opening the
door for the use of novel view synthesis in space applications.

Abstract: We present a universal prior model for 3D head avatars with explicit hair
compositionality. Existing approaches to build generalizable priors for 3D head
avatars often adopt a holistic modeling approach, treating the face and hair as
an inseparable entity. This overlooks the inherent compositionality of the
human head, making it difficult for the model to naturally disentangle face and
hair representations, especially when the dataset is limited. Furthermore, such
holistic models struggle to support applications like 3D face and hairstyle
swapping in a flexible and controllable manner. To address these challenges, we
introduce a prior model that explicitly accounts for the compositionality of
face and hair, learning their latent spaces separately. A key enabler of this
approach is our synthetic hairless data creation pipeline, which removes hair
from studio-captured datasets using estimated hairless geometry and texture
derived from a diffusion prior. By leveraging a paired dataset of hair and
hairless captures, we train disentangled prior models for face and hair,
incorporating compositionality as an inductive bias to facilitate effective
separation. Our model's inherent compositionality enables seamless transfer of
face and hair components between avatars while preserving identity.
Additionally, we demonstrate that our model can be fine-tuned in a few-shot
manner using monocular captures to create high-fidelity, hair-compositional 3D
head avatars for unseen subjects. These capabilities highlight the practical
applicability of our approach in real-world scenarios, paving the way for
flexible and expressive 3D avatar generation.

Abstract: Pneumonia remains one of the leading causes of death among children

In this paper, we propose an interpretable deep learning model on Residual

paediatric chest X-rays dataset, achieves high classification accuracy

Conclusion: 学习型单像素荧光显微成像有望推动诊断和生物研究，低成本实现多光谱成像。

Abstract: Single-pixel imaging has emerged as a key technique in fluorescence
microscopy, where fast acquisition and reconstruction are crucial. In this
context, images are reconstructed from linearly compressed measurements. In
practice, total variation minimisation is still used to reconstruct the image
from noisy measurements of the inner product between orthogonal sampling
pattern vectors and the original image data. However, data can be leveraged to
learn the measurement vectors and the reconstruction process, thereby enhancing
compression, reconstruction quality, and speed. We train an autoencoder through
self-supervision to learn an encoder (or measurement matrix) and a decoder. We
then test it on physically acquired multispectral and intensity data. During
acquisition, the learned encoder becomes part of the physical device. Our
approach can enhance single-pixel imaging in fluorescence microscopy by
reducing reconstruction time by two orders of magnitude, achieving superior
image quality, and enabling multispectral reconstructions. Ultimately, learned
single-pixel fluorescence microscopy could advance diagnosis and biological
research, providing multispectral imaging at a fraction of the cost.

Abstract: We propose image-to-image diffusion models that are designed to enhance the
realism and details of generated brain images by introducing sharp edges, fine
textures, subtle anatomical features, and imaging noise. Generative models have
been widely adopted in the biomedical domain, especially in image generation
applications. Latent diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art results in
generating brain MRIs. However, due to latent compression, generated images
from these models are overly smooth, lacking fine anatomical structures and
scan acquisition noise that are typically seen in real images. This work
formulates the realism enhancing and detail adding process as image-to-image
diffusion models, which refines the quality of LDM-generated images. We employ
commonly used metrics like FID and LPIPS for image realism assessment.
Furthermore, we introduce new metrics to demonstrate the realism of images
generated by RealDeal in terms of image noise distribution, sharpness, and
texture.

Abstract: Brachytherapy involves bringing a radioactive source near tumor tissue using
implanted needles. Image-guided brachytherapy planning requires amongst others,
the reconstruction of the needles. Manually annotating these needles on patient
images can be a challenging and time-consuming task for medical professionals.
For automatic needle reconstruction, a two-stage pipeline is commonly adopted,
comprising a segmentation stage followed by a post-processing stage. While deep
learning models are effective for segmentation, their results often contain
errors. No currently existing post-processing technique is robust to all
possible segmentation errors. We therefore propose adaptations to existing
post-processing techniques mainly aimed at dealing with segmentation errors and
thereby improving the reconstruction accuracy. Experiments on a prostate cancer
dataset, based on MRI scans annotated by medical professionals, demonstrate
that our proposed adaptations can help to effectively manage segmentation
errors, with the best adapted post-processing technique achieving median
needle-tip and needle-bottom point localization errors of $1.07$ (IQR $\pm
1.04$) mm and $0.43$ (IQR $\pm 0.46$) mm, respectively, and median shaft error
of $0.75$ (IQR $\pm 0.69$) mm with 0 false positive and 0 false negative

Abstract: Medical imaging plays a critical role in modern healthcare, enabling
clinicians to accurately diagnose diseases and develop effective treatment
plans. However, noise, often introduced by imaging devices, can degrade image
quality, leading to misinterpretation and compromised clinical outcomes.
Existing denoising approaches typically rely either on noise characteristics or
on contextual information from the image. Moreover, they are commonly developed
and evaluated for a single imaging modality and noise type. Motivated by Geng
et.al CNCL, which integrates both noise and context, this study introduces a
Dual-Pathway Learning (DPL) model architecture that effectively denoises
medical images by leveraging both sources of information and fusing them to
generate the final output. DPL is evaluated across multiple imaging modalities
and various types of noise, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.
DPL improves PSNR by 3.35% compared to the baseline UNet when evaluated on
Gaussian noise and trained across all modalities. The code is available at

Abstract: Background: It is fundamental for accurate segmentation and quantification of
the pulmonary vessel, particularly smaller vessels, from computed tomography
(CT) images in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients.
Objective: The aim of this study was to segment the pulmonary vasculature using
a semi-supervised method. Methods: In this study, a self-training framework is
proposed by leveraging a teacher-student model for the segmentation of
pulmonary vessels. First, the high-quality annotations are acquired in the
in-house data by an interactive way. Then, the model is trained in the
semi-supervised way. A fully supervised model is trained on a small set of
labeled CT images, yielding the teacher model. Following this, the teacher
model is used to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled CT images, from which
reliable ones are selected based on a certain strategy. The training of the
student model involves these reliable pseudo-labels. This training process is
iteratively repeated until an optimal performance is achieved. Results:
Extensive experiments are performed on non-enhanced CT scans of 125 COPD
patients. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that the proposed
method, Semi2, significantly improves the precision of vessel segmentation by
2.3%, achieving a precision of 90.3%. Further, quantitative analysis is
conducted in the pulmonary vessel of COPD, providing insights into the
differences in the pulmonary vessel across different severity of the disease.
Conclusion: The proposed method can not only improve the performance of
pulmonary vascular segmentation, but can also be applied in COPD analysis. The
code will be made available at

Abstract: Context modeling is essential in learned image compression for accurately
estimating the distribution of latents. While recent advanced methods have
expanded context modeling capacity, they still struggle to efficiently exploit
long-range dependency and diverse context information across different coding
steps. In this paper, we introduce a novel Hierarchical Progressive Context
Model (HPCM) for more efficient context information acquisition. Specifically,
HPCM employs a hierarchical coding schedule to sequentially model the
contextual dependencies among latents at multiple scales, which enables more
efficient long-range context modeling. Furthermore, we propose a progressive
context fusion mechanism that incorporates contextual information from previous
coding steps into the current step, effectively exploiting diverse contextual
information. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance and strikes a better balance
between compression performance and computational complexity. The code is

Abstract: In medical imaging, generative models are increasingly relied upon for two
distinct but equally critical tasks: reconstruction, where the goal is to
restore medical imaging (usually inverse problems like inpainting or
superresolution), and generation, where synthetic data is created to augment
datasets or carry out counterfactual analysis. Despite shared architecture and
learning frameworks, they prioritize different goals: generation seeks high
perceptual quality and diversity, while reconstruction focuses on data fidelity
and faithfulness. In this work, we introduce a "generative model zoo" and
systematically analyze how modern latent diffusion models and autoregressive
models navigate the reconstruction-generation spectrum. We benchmark a suite of
generative models across representative cardiac medical imaging tasks, focusing
on image inpainting with varying masking ratios and sampling strategies, as
well as unconditional image generation. Our findings show that diffusion models
offer superior perceptual quality for unconditional generation but tend to
hallucinate as masking ratios increase, whereas autoregressive models maintain
stable perceptual performance across masking levels, albeit with generally
lower fidelity.

Abstract: Mammography is the most commonly used imaging modality for breast cancer
screening, driving an increasing demand for deep-learning techniques to support
large-scale analysis. However, the development of accurate and robust methods
is often limited by insufficient data availability and a lack of diversity in
lesion characteristics. While generative models offer a promising solution for
data synthesis, current approaches often fail to adequately emphasize
lesion-specific features and their relationships with surrounding tissues. In
this paper, we propose Gated Conditional Diffusion Model (GCDM), a novel
framework designed to jointly synthesize holistic mammogram images and
localized lesions. GCDM is built upon a latent denoising diffusion framework,
where the noised latent image is concatenated with a soft mask embedding that
represents breast, lesion, and their transitional regions, ensuring anatomical
coherence between them during the denoising process. To further emphasize
lesion-specific features, GCDM incorporates a gated conditioning branch that
guides the denoising process by dynamically selecting and fusing the most
relevant radiomic and geometric properties of lesions, effectively capturing
their interplay. Experimental results demonstrate that GCDM achieves precise
control over small lesion areas while enhancing the realism and diversity of
synthesized mammograms. These advancements position GCDM as a promising tool
for clinical applications in mammogram synthesis. Our code is available at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: ULS23模型在纵向病灶分析中表现不佳，主要因扫描配准错误和病灶对应失效导致分割质量下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ULS23模型在纵向CT扫描中的病灶分割和追踪性能，揭示单时间点模型在纵向数据中的局限性。

Method: 使用公开临床数据集，评估模型在基线和随访CT扫描中的表现，并通过人为位移实验验证模型对病灶中心的依赖性。

Result: 模型性能高度依赖病灶中心假设，位移后分割准确性显著下降。

Conclusion: 需开发集成端到端模型，专门用于纵向分析，以提升病灶追踪的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Longitudinal lesion analysis is crucial for oncological care, yet automated
tools often struggle with temporal consistency. While universal lesion
segmentation models have advanced, they are typically designed for single time
points. This paper investigates the performance of the ULS23 segmentation model
in a longitudinal context. Using a public clinical dataset of baseline and
follow-up CT scans, we evaluated the model's ability to segment and track
lesions over time. We identified two critical, interconnected failure modes: a
sharp degradation in segmentation quality in follow-up cases due to inter-scan
registration errors, and a subsequent breakdown of the lesion correspondence
process. To systematically probe this vulnerability, we conducted a controlled
experiment where we artificially displaced the input volume relative to the
true lesion center. Our results demonstrate that the model's performance is
highly dependent on its assumption of a centered lesion; segmentation accuracy
collapses when the lesion is sufficiently displaced. These findings reveal a
fundamental limitation of applying single-timepoint models to longitudinal
data. We conclude that robust oncological tracking requires a paradigm shift
away from cascading single-purpose tools towards integrated, end-to-end models
inherently designed for temporal analysis.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) and dynamic 3D+time (4D) reconstruction of coronary
arteries from X-ray coronary angiography (CA) has the potential to improve
clinical procedures. However, there are multiple challenges to be addressed,
most notably, blood-vessel structure sparsity, poor background and blood vessel
distinction, sparse-views, and intra-scan motion. State-of-the-art
reconstruction approaches rely on time-consuming manual or error-prone
automatic segmentations, limiting clinical usability. Recently, approaches
based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown promise for automatic
reconstructions in the sparse-view setting. However, they suffer from long
training times due to their dependence on MLP-based representations. We propose
NerT-CA, a hybrid approach of Neural and Tensorial representations for
accelerated 4D reconstructions with sparse-view CA. Building on top of the
previous NeRF-based work, we model the CA scene as a decomposition of low-rank
and sparse components, utilizing fast tensorial fields for low-rank static
reconstruction and neural fields for dynamic sparse reconstruction. Our
approach outperforms previous works in both training time and reconstruction
accuracy, yielding reasonable reconstructions from as few as three angiogram
views. We validate our approach quantitatively and qualitatively on
representative 4D phantom datasets.
