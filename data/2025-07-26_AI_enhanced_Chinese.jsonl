Prior work has\nexplored augmenting training data with LLM-synthesized rationales and applying\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance reasoning ability, which in turn can\nimprove downstream action prediction. However, the performance of such\napproaches remains inherently bounded by the reasoning capabilities of the\nmodel used to generate the rationales. In this paper, we introduce Shop-R1, a\nnovel reinforcement learning (RL) framework aimed at enhancing the reasoning\nability of LLMs for simulation of real human behavior in online shopping\nenvironments Specifically, Shop-R1 decomposes the human behavior simulation\ntask into two stages: rationale generation and action prediction, each guided\nby distinct reward signals. For rationale generation, we leverage internal\nmodel signals (e.g., logit distributions) to guide the reasoning process in a\nself-supervised manner. For action prediction, we propose a hierarchical reward\nstructure with difficulty-aware scaling to prevent reward hacking and enable\nfine-grained reward assignment. This design evaluates both high-level action\ntypes and the correctness of fine-grained sub-action details (attributes and\nvalues), rewarding outputs proportionally to their difficulty.

Previous studies have\nmainly focused on ChatGPT and other well-known LLMs and have shown varying\naccuracy across detectors.

The detectors were exposed\nto the aforementioned adversarial attacks. We also considered DeepSeek as a\ndetector by performing few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT)\nfor classifying AI and human-written text. We collected 49 human-authored\nquestion-answer pairs from before the LLM era and generated matching responses\nusing DeepSeek-v3, producing 49 AI-generated samples. Then, we applied\nadversarial techniques such as paraphrasing and humanizing to add 196 more\nsamples. These were used to challenge detector robustness and assess accuracy\nimpact. While QuillBot and Copyleaks showed near-perfect performance on\noriginal and paraphrased DeepSeek text, others -- particularly AI Text\nClassifier and GPT-2 -- showed inconsistent results. The most effective attack\nwas humanization, reducing accuracy to 71% for Copyleaks, 58% for QuillBot, and\n52% for GPTZero.

Our approach employs a DWT-VGG16-LDA based keyframe extraction\nmechanism that intelligently identifies the 16 most representative frames from\nsports sequences, followed by a V-DWT-JEPA2 encoder pretrained through\nmask-denoising objectives and an LLM decoder fine-tuned for sports action\ndescription generation.

We identify key challenges rooted in Tigrinya's\nmorphological complexity and resource scarcity, while highlighting promising\nresearch directions, including morphology-aware modeling, cross-lingual\ntransfer, and community-centered resource development. This work serves as both\na comprehensive reference for researchers and a roadmap for advancing Tigrinya\nNLP. A curated metadata of the surveyed studies and resources is made publicly\navailable.\\footnote{Tigrinya NLP Anthology:\nhttps://github.com/fgaim/tigrinya-nlp-anthology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u63d0\u683c\u91cc\u5c3c\u4e9a\u8bed\uff08Tigrinya\uff09\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\uff08NLP\uff09\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u73b0\u72b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e862011\u5e74\u81f32025\u5e74\u768440\u591a\u9879\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u683c\u91cc\u5c3c\u4e9a\u8bed\u5728NLP\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u68b3\u7406\u5176\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u56de\u987e40\u591a\u9879\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8d44\u6e90\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u3001\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4ece\u89c4\u5219\u7cfb\u7edf\u5230\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u8d44\u6e90\u521b\u5efa\u662f\u5173\u952e\u63a8\u52a8\u529b\u3002\u63d0\u683c\u91cc\u5c3c\u4e9a\u8bed\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u7a00\u7f3a\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u63d0\u683c\u91cc\u5c3c\u4e9a\u8bedNLP\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u548c\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u516c\u5f00\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

Yet,\naccurately measuring engagement in virtual group settings remains a challenge.\nThere is increasing interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) for\nlarge-scale, real-world, automated engagement recognition. While engagement has\nbeen widely studied in younger academic populations, research and datasets\nfocused on older adults in virtual and telehealth learning settings remain\nlimited. Existing methods often neglect contextual relevance and the\nlongitudinal nature of engagement across sessions. This paper introduces OPEN\n(Older adult Patient ENgagement), a novel dataset supporting AI-driven\nengagement recognition. It was collected from eleven older adults participating\nin weekly virtual group learning sessions over six weeks as part of cardiac\nrehabilitation, producing over 35 hours of data, making it the largest dataset\nof its kind. To protect privacy, raw video is withheld; instead, the released\ndata include facial, hand, and body joint landmarks, along with affective and\nbehavioral features extracted from video. Annotations include binary engagement\nstates, affective and behavioral labels, and context-type indicators, such as\nwhether the instructor addressed the group or an individual. The dataset offers\nversions with 5-, 10-, 30-second, and variable-length samples. To demonstrate\nutility, multiple machine learning and deep learning models were trained,\nachieving engagement recognition accuracy of up to 81 percent. OPEN provides a\nscalable foundation for personalized engagement modeling in aging populations\nand contributes to broader engagement recognition research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86OPEN\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u865a\u62df\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523081%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u865a\u62df\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\u5bf9\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u7fa4\u5c24\u5176\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u957f\u671f\u6027\u8003\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6536\u96c611\u540d\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u516d\u5468\u865a\u62df\u5eb7\u590d\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u9762\u90e8\u3001\u624b\u52bf\u3001\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\uff09\uff0c\u6784\u5efaOPEN\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe81%\u3002", "conclusion": "OPEN\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3a\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u7fa4\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

To enhance model\nefficiency and versatility, we propose a modular, staged training strategy that\nprogressively aligns linguistic, paralinguistic, and speaker characteristic\ninformation using large-scale speech-text corpora. Experimental results on\nTELEVAL, a multi-dimensional evaluation benchmark, demonstrate that GOAT-SLM\nachieves well-balanced performance across both semantic and non-semantic tasks,\nand outperforms existing open-source models in handling emotion, dialectal\nvariation, and age-sensitive interactions. This work highlights the importance\nof modeling beyond linguistic content and advances the development of more\nnatural, adaptive, and socially aware spoken language systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "GOAT-SLM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u53e3\u8bed\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u6355\u6349\u8bed\u97f3\u4e2d\u7684\u526f\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7eaf\u8bed\u4e49\u5904\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53e3\u8bed\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u591a\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u8bed\u8a00\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u4e2d\u7684\u526f\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u65b9\u8a00\u3001\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u4ea4\u4e92\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "GOAT-SLM\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u6a21\u6001\u5934\u90e8\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u58f0\u5b66\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u9010\u6b65\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u526f\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u7279\u5f81\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728TELEVAL\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cGOAT-SLM\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u975e\u8bed\u4e49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u3001\u65b9\u8a00\u548c\u5e74\u9f84\u654f\u611f\u4ea4\u4e92\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "GOAT-SLM\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u8d85\u8d8a\u8bed\u8a00\u5185\u5bb9\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u66f4\u81ea\u7136\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u793e\u4f1a\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u53e3\u8bed\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Specifically, average F1 scores rise\nfrom 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's\nsuperior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable\ndiffusion models. As for robustness, ViGText achieves an increase of 11.1% in\nrecall compared to other deepfake detection approaches. When facing targeted\nattacks that exploit its graph-based architecture, ViGText limits\nclassification performance degradation to less than 4%.

However,\nthis reliance on external sources exposes a security risk, attackers can inject\npoisoned documents into the knowledge base to steer the generation process\ntoward harmful or misleading outputs. In this paper, we propose Gradient-based\nMasked Token Probability (GMTP), a novel defense method to detect and filter\nout adversarially crafted documents. Specifically, GMTP identifies high-impact\ntokens by examining gradients of the retriever's similarity function.

All comments are welcome", "summary": "In the medical image analysis field, precise quantification of curve\ntortuosity plays a critical role in the auxiliary diagnosis and pathological\nassessment of various diseases. In this study, we propose a novel framework for\ntortuosity quantification and demonstrate its effectiveness through the\nevaluation of meibomian gland atrophy uniformity,serving as a representative\napplication scenario.\n  We introduce an information entropy-based tortuosity quantification framework\nthat integrates probability modeling with entropy theory and incorporates\ndomain transformation of curve data. Unlike traditional methods such as\ncurvature or arc-chord ratio, this approach evaluates the tortuosity of a\ntarget curve by comparing it to a designated reference curve. Consequently, it\nis more suitable for tortuosity assessment tasks in medical data where\nbiologically plausible reference curves are available, providing a more robust\nand objective evaluation metric without relying on idealized straight-line\ncomparisons.\n  First, we conducted numerical simulation experiments to preliminarily assess\nthe stability and validity of the method.

While diffusion-based methods\nhave shown promising performance due to their strong generative capabilities.\nHowever, their unidirectional modelling of degradation often struggles to\ncapture the complexity of real-world degradation patterns, leading to\nstructural inconsistencies and pixel misalignments. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a bidirectional diffusion optimization mechanism that\njointly models the degradation processes of both low-light and normal-light\nimages, enabling more precise degradation parameter matching and enhancing\ngeneration quality. Specifically, we perform bidirectional diffusion-from\nlow-to-normal light and from normal-to-low light during training and introduce\nan adaptive feature interaction block (AFI) to refine feature representation.\nBy leveraging the complementarity between these two paths, our approach imposes\nan implicit symmetry constraint on illumination attenuation and noise\ndistribution, facilitating consistent degradation learning and improving the\nmodels ability to perceive illumination and detail degradation. Additionally,\nwe design a reflection-aware correction module (RACM) to guide color\nrestoration post-denoising and suppress overexposed regions, ensuring content\nconsistency and generating high-quality images that align with human visual\nperception.

This\ntrend highlights the vital role of sentiment analysis as a tool for quantifying\nthe nature and strength of such opinions. With the rapid development of\nGenerative AI (GenAI), supervised fine-tuned (SFT) large language models (LLMs)\nhave become the de facto standard for financial sentiment analysis. However,\nthe SFT paradigm can lead to memorization of the training data and often fails\nto generalize to unseen samples. This is a critical limitation in financial\ndomains, where models must adapt to previously unobserved events and the\nnuanced, domain-specific language of finance. To this end, we introduce FinDPO,\nthe first finance-specific LLM framework based on post-training human\npreference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).

To address this gap, we\npresent AraTable, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the\nreasoning and understanding capabilities of LLMs when applied to Arabic tabular\ndata.

By simply fusing\nconditional and unconditional text embeddings using linear operations,\nTeEFusion reconstructs the desired guidance without adding extra parameters,\nsimultaneously enabling the student model to learn from the teacher's output\nproduced via its sophisticated sampling approach. Extensive experiments on\nstate-of-the-art models such as SD3 demonstrate that our method allows the\nstudent to closely mimic the teacher's performance with a far simpler and more\nefficient sampling strategy. Consequently, the student model achieves inference\nspeeds up to 6$\\times$ faster than the teacher model, while maintaining image\nquality at levels comparable to those obtained through the teacher's complex\nsampling approach.

This paper aims to\nconduct a systematic review on generating synthetic medical free-text by\nformulating quantitative analysis to three research questions concerning (i)\nthe purpose of generation, (ii) the techniques, and (iii) the evaluation\nmethods. We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE,\nGoogle Scholar, and arXiv databases for publications associated with generating\nsynthetic medical unstructured free-text. We have identified 94 relevant\narticles out of 1,398 collected ones. A great deal of attention has been given\nto the generation of synthetic medical text from 2018 onwards, where the main\npurpose of such a generation is towards text augmentation, assistive writing,\ncorpus building, privacy-preserving, annotation, and usefulness. Transformer\narchitectures were the main predominant technique used to generate the text,\nespecially the GPTs. On the other hand, there were four main aspects of\nevaluation, including similarity, privacy, structure, and utility, where\nutility was the most frequent method used to assess the generated synthetic\nmedical text. Although the generated synthetic medical text demonstrated a\nmoderate possibility to act as real medical documents in different downstream\nNLP tasks, it has proven to be a great asset as augmented, complementary to the\nreal documents, towards improving the accuracy and overcoming\nsparsity/undersampling issues. Yet, privacy is still a major issue behind\ngenerating synthetic medical text, where more human assessments are needed to\ncheck for the existence of any sensitive information.

In this work, we propose LONG3R (LOng sequence streaming 3D\nReconstruction), a novel model designed for streaming multi-view 3D scene\nreconstruction over longer sequences. Our model achieves real-time processing\nby operating recurrently, maintaining and updating memory with each new\nobservation. We first employ a memory gating mechanism to filter relevant\nmemory, which, together with a new observation, is fed into a dual-source\nrefined decoder for coarse-to-fine interaction. To effectively capture\nlong-sequence memory, we propose a 3D spatio-temporal memory that dynamically\nprunes redundant spatial information while adaptively adjusting resolution\nalong the scene.

These ice clouds can\nalter Earth's radiative balance, potentially rivaling the warming effect of\naviation CO2. Physics-based models provide useful estimates of contrail\nformation and climate impact, but their accuracy depends heavily on the quality\nof atmospheric input data and on assumptions used to represent complex\nprocesses like ice particle formation and humidity-driven persistence.\nObservational data from remote sensors, such as satellites and ground cameras,\ncould be used to validate and calibrate these models. However, existing\ndatasets don't explore all aspect of contrail dynamics and formation: they\ntypically lack temporal tracking, and do not attribute contrails to their\nsource flights. To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible\nCamera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set of contrails recorded\nwith a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is\nindividually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its\nlifecycle. The dataset contains 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) and\nincludes flight identifiers for contrails that form above the camera. As\nreference, we also propose a unified deep learning framework for contrail\nanalysis using a panoptic segmentation model that performs semantic\nsegmentation (contrail pixel identification), instance segmentation (individual\ncontrail separation), and temporal tracking in a single architecture. By\nproviding high-quality, temporally resolved annotations and a benchmark for\nmodel evaluation, our work supports improved contrail monitoring and will\nfacilitate better calibration of physical models.

This task requires estimating multiple material\nmaps and usually relies on the constraint of rendering result. The absence of\nconstraints on the material maps makes inverse rendering an ill-posed task.\nPrevious works alleviated this problem by building material dataset for\ntraining, but their simplified material data and rendering equation lead to\nrendering results with limited realism, especially that of skin. To further\nalleviate this problem, we construct a higher-quality dataset (OpenHumanBRDF)\nbased on scanned real data and statistical material data. In addition to the\nnormal, diffuse albedo, roughness, specular albedo, we produce displacement and\nsubsurface scattering to enhance the realism of rendering results, especially\nfor the skin.

Therefore, we\ndesign a model (HumanMaterial) with progressive training strategy to make full\nuse of the supervision information of the material maps and improve the\nperformance of material estimation. HumanMaterial first obtain the initial\nmaterial results via three prior models, and then refine the results by a\nfinetuning model.

Thus, we design a Controlled\nPBR Rendering (CPR) loss, which enhances the importance of the materials to be\noptimized during the training of prior models.

To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first study to adopt V-JEPA for ultrasound video data.\nSimilar to other patch-based masking SSL techniques such as VideoMAE, V-JEPA is\nwell-suited to ViT-based models. However, ViTs can underperform on small\nmedical datasets due to lack of inductive biases, limited spatial locality and\nabsence of hierarchical feature learning. To improve locality understanding, we\npropose a novel 3D localisation auxiliary task to improve locality in ViT\nrepresentations during V-JEPA pre-training. Our results show V-JEPA with our\nauxiliary task improves segmentation performance significantly across various\nfrozen encoder configurations, with gains up to 3.4\\% using 100\\% and up to\n8.35\\% using only 10\\% of the training data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eV-JEPA\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u54083D\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8f85\u52a9\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8d85\u58f0\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d85\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528V-JEPA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u51653D\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8f85\u52a9\u4efb\u52a1\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3aViT\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728100%\u548c10%\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd3.4%\u548c8.35%\u3002", "conclusion": "V-JEPA\u7ed3\u54083D\u8f85\u52a9\u4efb\u52a1\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8d85\u58f0\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002"}}

In this\npaper, we propose a novel deep learning approach for head pose estimation with\nlimited training data via non-linear manifold learning called NLML-HPE. This\nmethod is based on the combination of tensor decomposition (i.e., Tucker\ndecomposition) and feed forward neural networks. Unlike traditional\nclassification-based approaches, our method formulates head pose estimation as\na regression problem, mapping input landmarks into a continuous representation\nof pose angles. To this end, our method uses tensor decomposition to split each\nEuler angle (yaw, pitch, roll) to separate subspaces and models each dimension\nof the underlying manifold as a cosine curve. We address two key challenges: 1.\nAlmost all HPE datasets suffer from incorrect and inaccurate pose annotations.\nHence, we generated a precise and consistent 2D head pose dataset for our\ntraining set by rotating 3D head models for a fixed set of poses and rendering\nthe corresponding 2D images. 2. We achieved real-time performance with limited\ntraining data as our method accurately captures the nature of rotation of an\nobject from facial landmarks. Once the underlying manifold for rotation around\neach axis is learned, the model is very fast in predicting unseen data.

Its effectiveness largely depends on precise camera poses and\naccurate point cloud initialization, which are often derived from pretrained\nMulti-View Stereo (MVS) models. However, in unposed reconstruction task from\nhundreds of outdoor images, existing MVS models may struggle with memory limits\nand lose accuracy as the number of input images grows. To address this\nlimitation, we propose a novel unposed 3DGS reconstruction framework that\nintegrates pretrained MVS priors with the probabilistic Procrustes mapping\nstrategy. The method partitions input images into subsets, maps submaps into a\nglobal space, and jointly optimizes geometry and poses with 3DGS. Technically,\nwe formulate the mapping of tens of millions of point clouds as a probabilistic\nProcrustes problem and solve a closed-form alignment. By employing\nprobabilistic coupling along with a soft dustbin mechanism to reject uncertain\ncorrespondences, our method globally aligns point clouds and poses within\nminutes across hundreds of images.

To\naddress this, we propose a novel 3D cross-modal keypoint descriptor for MRI-iUS\nmatching and registration. Our approach employs a patient-specific\nmatching-by-synthesis approach, generating synthetic iUS volumes from\npreoperative MRI. This enables supervised contrastive training to learn a\nshared descriptor space.\n  A probabilistic keypoint detection strategy is then employed to identify\nanatomically salient and modality-consistent locations. During training, a\ncurriculum-based triplet loss with dynamic hard negative mining is used to\nlearn descriptors that are i) robust to iUS artifacts such as speckle noise and\nlimited coverage, and ii) rotation-invariant . At inference, the method detects\nkeypoints in MR and real iUS images and identifies sparse matches, which are\nthen used to perform rigid registration. Our approach is evaluated using 3D\nMRI-iUS pairs from the ReMIND dataset. Experiments show that our approach\noutperforms state-of-the-art keypoint matching methods across 11 patients, with\nan average precision of $69.8\\%$. For image registration, our method achieves a\ncompetitive mean Target Registration Error of 2.39 mm on the ReMIND2Reg\nbenchmark.\n  Compared to existing iUS-MR registration approach, our framework is\ninterpretable, requires no manual initialization, and shows robustness to iUS\nfield-of-view variation.

Specifically, every video and its audio is described across three\nhierarchical layers (factual, abstract, and intent), progressing from surface\nto depth. It contains over 22 million words, averaging ~225 words per sample.\nVideoMind's key distinction from existing datasets is its provision of intent\nexpressions, which require contextual integration across the entire video and\nare not directly observable. These deep-cognitive expressions are generated\nusing a Chain-of-Thought (COT) approach, prompting the mLLM through\nstep-by-step reasoning.

To enable adaptation without\ntarget images, existing studies utilize CLIP's embedding space and text\ndescription to simulate target-like style features. Despite the previous\nachievements in zero-shot domain adaptation, we observe that these text-driven\nmethods struggle to capture complex real-world variations and significantly\nincrease adaptation time due to their alignment process. Instead of relying on\ntext descriptions, we explore solutions leveraging image data, which provides\ndiverse and more fine-grained style cues. In this work, we propose SIDA, a\nnovel and efficient zero-shot domain adaptation method leveraging synthetic\nimages. To generate synthetic images, we first create detailed, source-like\nimages and apply image translation to reflect the style of the target domain.\nWe then utilize the style features of these synthetic images as a proxy for the\ntarget domain. Based on these features, we introduce Domain Mix and Patch Style\nTransfer modules, which enable effective modeling of real-world variations. In\nparticular, Domain Mix blends multiple styles to expand the intra-domain\nrepresentations, and Patch Style Transfer assigns different styles to\nindividual patches.
