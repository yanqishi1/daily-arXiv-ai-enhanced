While\nrecent video generation models have shown strong potential in modeling dynamic\nscenes, generating videos that are both temporally coherent and geometrically\nconsistent across camera views remains a significant challenge. To address\nthis, we propose a 4D video generation model that enforces multi-view 3D\nconsistency of videos by supervising the model with cross-view pointmap\nalignment during training. This geometric supervision enables the model to\nlearn a shared 3D representation of the scene, allowing it to predict future\nvideo sequences from novel viewpoints based solely on the given RGB-D\nobservations, without requiring camera poses as inputs. Compared to existing\nbaselines, our method produces more visually stable and spatially aligned\npredictions across multiple simulated and real-world robotic datasets.

This minimizes environmental impacts, supports\nsustainable land management, and improves outcomes across agricultural and\nnatural environments. Recent advances in weed mapping leverage ground-vehicle\nRed Green Blue (RGB) cameras, satellite and drone-based remote sensing combined\nwith sensors such as spectral, Near Infra-Red (NIR), and thermal cameras. The\nresulting data are processed using advanced techniques including big data\nanalytics and machine learning, significantly improving the spatial and\ntemporal resolution of weed maps and enabling site-specific management\ndecisions. Despite a growing body of research in this domain, there is a lack\nof comprehensive literature reviews specifically focused on weed mapping. In\nparticular, the absence of a structured analysis spanning the entire mapping\npipeline, from data acquisition to processing techniques and mapping tools,\nlimits progress in the field.

This approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model,\nStable Diffusion XL, to overcome the generalization failures of existing\nmethods that rely on limited HDR panorama datasets. While conceptually simple,\nthe task remains challenging because diffusion models often insert incorrect or\ninconsistent content and cannot readily generate chrome balls in HDR format.\nOur analysis reveals that the inpainting process is highly sensitive to the\ninitial noise in the diffusion process, occasionally resulting in unrealistic\noutputs. To address this, we first introduce DiffusionLight, which uses\niterative inpainting to compute a median chrome ball from multiple outputs to\nserve as a stable, low-frequency lighting prior that guides the generation of a\nhigh-quality final result. To generate high-dynamic-range (HDR) light probes,\nan Exposure LoRA is fine-tuned to create LDR images at multiple exposure\nvalues, which are then merged. While effective, DiffusionLight is\ntime-intensive, requiring approximately 30 minutes per estimation. To reduce\nthis overhead, we introduce DiffusionLight-Turbo, which reduces the runtime to\nabout 30 seconds with minimal quality loss. This 60x speedup is achieved by\ntraining a Turbo LoRA to directly predict the averaged chrome balls from the\niterative process. Inference is further streamlined into a single denoising\npass using a LoRA swapping technique. Experimental results that show our method\nproduces convincing light estimates across diverse settings and demonstrates\nsuperior generalization to in-the-wild scenarios.

To this end, we propose\na Long-Tailed Distribution-aware Router (LTDR) for vision-language TER,\ntackling two challenges: (1) Distribution-aware router for modality-specific\nrouting. We observe that language TER follows a uniform distribution, whereas\nvision TER exhibits a long-tailed distribution. This discrepancy necessitates\ndistinct routing strategies tailored to each modality. (2) Enhancing expert\nactivation for vision tail tokens. Recognizing the importance of vision tail\ntokens, we introduce an oversampling-like strategy by increasing the number of\nactivated experts for these tokens.

However, existing\nmethods often suffer from identity leakage (IL) and rendering artifacts (RA),\nparticularly in extreme cases. Through an in-depth analysis of previous\napproaches, we identify two key insights: (1) IL arises from identity\ninformation embedded within motion features, and (2) this identity information\ncan be leveraged to address RA. Building on these findings, this paper\nintroduces FixTalk, a novel framework designed to simultaneously resolve both\nissues for high-quality talking head generation. Firstly, we propose an\nEnhanced Motion Indicator (EMI) to effectively decouple identity information\nfrom motion features, mitigating the impact of IL on generated talking heads.\nTo address RA, we introduce an Enhanced Detail Indicator (EDI), which utilizes\nthe leaked identity information to supplement missing details, thus fixing the\nartifacts.

Prior work suggests that the use of\nexternal information, e.g., excerpts from Wikipedia, improves stance detection\nperformance. However, whether or not such information can benefit large\nlanguage models (LLMs) remains an unanswered question, despite their wide\nadoption in many reasoning tasks. In this study, we conduct a systematic\nevaluation on how Wikipedia and web search external information can affect\nstance detection across eight LLMs and in three datasets with 12 targets.\nSurprisingly, we find that such information degrades performance in most cases,\nwith macro F1 scores dropping by up to 27.9\\%. We explain this through\nexperiments showing LLMs' tendency to align their predictions with the stance\nand sentiment of the provided information rather than the ground truth stance\nof the given text.

However, despite the dramatic improvement in generative\nvision-language models, fine-grained control over the properties of generated\ncaptions is not easy due to two reasons: (i) existing models are not given the\nproperties as a condition during training and (ii) existing models cannot\nsmoothly transition its language pattern from one state to the other. Given\nthis challenge, we propose a new approach, CaptionSmiths, to acquire a single\ncaptioning model that can handle diverse language patterns. First, our approach\nquantifies three properties of each caption, length, descriptiveness, and\nuniqueness of a word, as continuous scalar values, without human annotation.\nGiven the values, we represent the conditioning via interpolation between two\nendpoint vectors corresponding to the extreme states, e.g., one for a very\nshort caption and one for a very long caption. Empirical results demonstrate\nthat the resulting model can smoothly change the properties of the output\ncaptions and show higher lexical alignment than baselines.

However, existing methods tend to remove shadows with constant\ncolor background and ignore color shadows. In this paper, we first design a\ndiffusion model in latent space for document image shadow removal, called\nDocShaDiffusion. It translates shadow images from pixel space to latent space,\nenabling the model to more easily capture essential features. To address the\nissue of color shadows, we design a shadow soft-mask generation module (SSGM).\nIt is able to produce accurate shadow mask and add noise into shadow regions\nspecially. Guided by the shadow mask, a shadow mask-aware guided diffusion\nmodule (SMGDM) is proposed to remove shadows from document images by\nsupervising the diffusion and denoising process. We also propose a\nshadow-robust perceptual feature loss to preserve details and structures in\ndocument images.

While robust watermarking can aid in authenticity\nverification and source tracking, existing methods often lack the sufficient\nrobustness against Deepfake manipulations. Diffusion models have demonstrated\nremarkable performance in image generation, enabling the seamless fusion of\nwatermark with image during generation. In this study, we propose a novel\nrobust watermarking framework based on diffusion model, called DiffMark. By\nmodifying the training and sampling scheme, we take the facial image and\nwatermark as conditions to guide the diffusion model to progressively denoise\nand generate corresponding watermarked image. In the construction of facial\ncondition, we weight the facial image by a timestep-dependent factor that\ngradually reduces the guidance intensity with the decrease of noise, thus\nbetter adapting to the sampling process of diffusion model. To achieve the\nfusion of watermark condition, we introduce a cross information fusion (CIF)\nmodule that leverages a learnable embedding table to adaptively extract\nwatermark features and integrates them with image features via cross-attention.\nTo enhance the robustness of the watermark against Deepfake manipulations, we\nintegrate a frozen autoencoder during training phase to simulate Deepfake\nmanipulations. Additionally, we introduce Deepfake-resistant guidance that\nemploys specific Deepfake model to adversarially guide the diffusion sampling\nprocess to generate more robust watermarked images.

Existing methods using maximal clique search in\ncompatibility graphs achieve high recall but suffer from exponential time\ncomplexity, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a fast and robust estimator, TurboReg, built upon a novel\nlightweight clique, TurboClique, and a highly parallelizable Pivot-Guided\nSearch (PGS) algorithm. First, we define the TurboClique as a 3-clique within a\nhighly-constrained compatibility graph. The lightweight nature of the 3-clique\nallows for efficient parallel searching, and the highly-constrained\ncompatibility graph ensures robust spatial consistency for stable\ntransformation estimation. Next, PGS selects matching pairs with high SC$^2$\nscores as pivots, effectively guiding the search toward TurboCliques with\nhigher inlier ratios. Moreover, the PGS algorithm has linear time complexity\nand is significantly more efficient than the maximal clique search with\nexponential time complexity.

Existing pixel-wise methods typically assign anomaly\nscores individually and employ a global thresholding strategy to segment\nanomalies. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches encounter significant\nchallenges in real-world applications: (1) neglecting spatial correlations\namong pixels within the same object, resulting in fragmented segmentation; (2)\nvariabil ity in anomaly score distributions across image regions, causing\nglobal thresholds to either generate false positives in background areas or\nmiss segments of anomalous objects. In this work, we introduce OoDDINO, a novel\nmulti-level anomaly segmentation framework designed to address these\nlimitations through a coarse-to-fine anomaly detection strategy. OoDDINO\ncombines an uncertainty-guided anomaly detection model with a pixel-level\nsegmentation model within a two-stage cascade architecture.

Subsequently, we\ndevelop an Adaptive Dual-Threshold Network (ADT-Net), which dynamically\ngenerates region-specific thresholds based on object-level detection outputs\nand pixel-wise anomaly scores. This approach allows for distinct thresholding\nstrategies within foreground and background areas, achieving fine-grained\nanomaly segmentation.

To explore their true detection\npotential, we integrate them with a machine learning model (U-Net, LinkNet).\nOur results identify two promising candidates (Mag1c-SAS and CEM), both\nacceptably accurate for the detection of strong plumes and computationally\nefficient enough for onboard deployment: one optimized more for accuracy, the\nother more for speed, achieving up to ~100x and ~230x faster computation than\noriginal Mag1c on resource-limited hardware.

Consequently,\nsegmentation models must ensure not only the semantic correctness of\nlarge-scale patches (low-frequency information) but also the precise\nlocalization of boundaries between patches (high-frequency information).\nHowever, most existing approaches rely heavily on discriminative learning,\nwhich excels at capturing low-frequency features, while overlooking its\ninherent limitations in learning high-frequency features for semantic\nsegmentation. Recent studies have revealed that diffusion generative models\nexcel at generating high-frequency details. Our theoretical analysis confirms\nthat the diffusion denoising process significantly enhances the model's ability\nto learn high-frequency features; however, we also observe that these models\nexhibit insufficient semantic inference for low-frequency features when guided\nsolely by the original image. Therefore, we integrate the strengths of both\ndiscriminative and generative learning, proposing the Integration of\nDiscriminative and diffusion-based Generative learning for Boundary Refinement\n(IDGBR) framework. The framework first generates a coarse segmentation map\nusing a discriminative backbone model.

They are being fast deployed as chatbots and evaluators\nin sensitive areas, such as peer review and mental health applications. This,\nalong with the disparate accounts on their reasoning capabilities, calls for a\ncloser examination of LLMs and their comprehension of dialogue. In this work we\nbegin by evaluating LLMs' ability to maintain a debate--one of the purest yet\nmost complex forms of human communication. Then we measure how this capability\nrelates to their understanding of what is being talked about, namely, their\ncomprehension of dialogical structures and the pragmatic context. We find that\nLLMs are capable of maintaining coherent, persuasive debates, often swaying the\nbeliefs of participants and audiences alike. We also note that awareness or\nsuspicion of AI involvement encourage people to be more critical of the\narguments made. When polling LLMs on their comprehension of deeper structures\nof dialogue, however, they cannot demonstrate said understanding.

However,\nMSE-oriented optimization tends to yield latent spaces with limited semantic\nrichness, which hinders effective semantic inference in downstream tasks.\nMoreover, achieving high performance with these models often requires\nfine-tuning the entire vision model, which is computationally intensive,\nespecially for large models. To address these problems, we introduce\nPerception-Oriented Latent Coding (POLC), an approach that enriches the\nsemantic content of latent features for high-performance compressed domain\nsemantic inference.

While prior studies\nhave predominantly concentrated on improving vision-language interactions and\nachieving fine-grained localization, a systematic analysis of the fundamental\nbottlenecks in existing RIS frameworks remains underexplored. To bridge this\ngap, we propose DeRIS, a novel framework that decomposes RIS into two key\ncomponents: perception and cognition. This modular decomposition facilitates a\nsystematic analysis of the primary bottlenecks impeding RIS performance. Our\nfindings reveal that the predominant limitation lies not in perceptual\ndeficiencies, but in the insufficient multi-modal cognitive capacity of current\nmodels. To mitigate this, we propose a Loopback Synergy mechanism, which\nenhances the synergy between the perception and cognition modules, thereby\nenabling precise segmentation while simultaneously improving robust image-text\ncomprehension.

In this paper, we\npioneer the investigation of Semi-LReID, introducing a novel Self-Reinforcing\nPrototype Evolution with Dual-Knowledge Cooperation framework (SPRED). Our key\ninnovation lies in establishing a self-reinforcing cycle between dynamic\nprototype-guided pseudo-label generation and new-old knowledge collaborative\npurification to enhance the utilization of unlabeled data.

To address this, patient-specific digital twins\n(DT) modeling temporally varying motion were created to assess the accuracy of\nDIR methods. Approach: 21 motion phases simulating digestive GI motion as 4D\nsequences were generated from static 3D patient scans using published\nanalytical GI motion models through a semi-automated pipeline. Eleven datasets,\nincluding six T2w FSE MRI (T2w MRI), two T1w 4D golden-angle stack-of-stars,\nand three contrast-enhanced CT scans. The motion amplitudes of the DTs were\nassessed against real patient stomach motion amplitudes extracted from\nindependent 4D MRI datasets. The generated DTs were then used to assess six\ndifferent DIR methods using target registration error, Dice similarity\ncoefficient, and the 95th percentile Hausdorff distance using summary metrics\nand voxel-level granular visualizations. Finally, for a subset of T2w MRI scans\nfrom patients treated with MR-guided radiation therapy, dose distributions were\nwarped and accumulated to assess dose warping errors, including evaluations of\nDIR performance in both low- and high-dose regions for patient-specific error\nestimation.

However,\ncurrent approaches conventionally separate image customization into\nposition-aware and position-free customization paradigms and lack a universal\nframework for diverse customization, limiting their applications across various\nscenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose IC-Custom, a unified\nframework that seamlessly integrates position-aware and position-free image\ncustomization through in-context learning. IC-Custom concatenates reference\nimages with target images to a polyptych, leveraging DiT's multi-modal\nattention mechanism for fine-grained token-level interactions. We introduce the\nIn-context Multi-Modal Attention (ICMA) mechanism with learnable task-oriented\nregister tokens and boundary-aware positional embeddings to enable the model to\ncorrectly handle different task types and distinguish various inputs in\npolyptych configurations. To bridge the data gap, we carefully curated a\nhigh-quality dataset of 12k identity-consistent samples with 8k from real-world\nsources and 4k from high-quality synthetic data, avoiding the overly glossy and\nover-saturated synthetic appearance. IC-Custom supports various industrial\napplications, including try-on, accessory placement, furniture arrangement, and\ncreative IP customization. Extensive evaluations on our proposed ProductBench\nand the publicly available DreamBench demonstrate that IC-Custom significantly\noutperforms community workflows, closed-source models, and state-of-the-art\nopen-source approaches. IC-Custom achieves approximately 73% higher human\npreference across identity consistency, harmonicity, and text alignment\nmetrics, while training only 0.4% of the original model parameters.

Long animation colorization has high labor costs. Therefore,\nautomated long animation colorization based on the video generation model has\nsignificant research value.

However, the local\nparadigm neglects global information, failing to maintain long-term color\nconsistency. In this study, we argue that ideal long-term color consistency can\nbe achieved through a dynamic global-local paradigm, i.e., dynamically\nextracting global color-consistent features relevant to the current generation.\nSpecifically, we propose LongAnimation, a novel framework, which mainly\nincludes a SketchDiT, a Dynamic Global-Local Memory (DGLM), and a Color\nConsistency Reward. The SketchDiT captures hybrid reference features to support\nthe DGLM module. The DGLM module employs a long video understanding model to\ndynamically compress global historical features and adaptively fuse them with\nthe current generation features. To refine the color consistency, we introduce\na Color Consistency Reward. During inference, we propose a color consistency\nfusion to smooth the video segment transition. Extensive experiments on both\nshort-term (14 frames) and long-term (average 500 frames) animations show the\neffectiveness of LongAnimation in maintaining short-term and long-term color\nconsistency for open-domain animation colorization task.

In this paper, we benchmark the performance of popular\nmultimodal foundation models (GPT-4o, o4-mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 2.0\nFlash, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Qwen2-VL, Llama 3.2) on standard computer vision\ntasks (semantic segmentation, object detection, image classification, depth and\nsurface normal prediction) using established datasets (e.g., COCO, ImageNet and\nits variants, etc).\n  The main challenges to performing this are: 1) most models are trained to\noutput text and cannot natively express versatile domains, such as segments or\n3D geometry, and 2) many leading models are proprietary and accessible only at\nan API level, i.e., there is no weight access to adapt them. We address these\nchallenges by translating standard vision tasks into equivalent text-promptable\nand API-compatible tasks via prompt chaining to create a standardized\nbenchmarking framework.\n  We observe that 1) the models are not close to the state-of-the-art\nspecialist models at any task. However, 2) they are respectable generalists;\nthis is remarkable as they are presumably trained on primarily image-text-based\ntasks. 3) They perform semantic tasks notably better than geometric ones. 4)\nWhile the prompt-chaining techniques affect performance, better models exhibit\nless sensitivity to prompt variations. 5) GPT-4o performs the best among\nnon-reasoning models, securing the top position in 4 out of 6 tasks, 6)\nreasoning models, e.g. o3, show improvements in geometric tasks, and 7) a\npreliminary analysis of models with native image generation, like the latest\nGPT-4o, shows they exhibit quirks like hallucinations and spatial\nmisalignments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982GPT-4o\u3001Gemini\u7b49\uff09\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u4eec\u867d\u4e0d\u53ca\u4e13\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u5c1a\u53ef\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u94fe\u5c06\u6807\u51c6\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u53ef\u63d0\u793a\u548cAPI\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u53ca\u4e13\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\uff1bGPT-4o\u5728\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff1b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u5c1a\u53ef\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u654f\u611f\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u3002"}}

Traditional autoregressive image generation\nrelies on next-patch prediction, a memory-bound process that leads to high\nlatency. Existing works have tried to parallelize next-patch prediction by\nshifting to multi-patch prediction to accelerate the process, but only achieved\nlimited parallelization. To achieve high parallelization while maintaining\ngeneration quality, we introduce two key techniques: (1) Flexible Parallelized\nAutoregressive Modeling, a novel architecture that enables arbitrary generation\nordering and degrees of parallelization. It uses learnable position query\ntokens to guide generation at target positions while ensuring mutual visibility\namong concurrently generated tokens for consistent parallel decoding. (2)\nLocality-aware Generation Ordering, a novel schedule that forms groups to\nminimize intra-group dependencies and maximize contextual support, enhancing\ngeneration quality. With these designs, we reduce the generation steps from 256\nto 20 (256$\\times$256 res.) and 1024 to 48 (512$\\times$512 res.) without\ncompromising quality on the ImageNet class-conditional generation, and\nachieving at least 3.4$\\times$ lower latency than previous parallelized\nautoregressive models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Locality-aware Parallel Decoding (LPD) \u901a\u8fc7\u7075\u6d3b\u5e76\u884c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u611f\u77e5\u751f\u6210\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4f9d\u8d56\u987a\u5e8f\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7075\u6d3b\u5e76\u884c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u611f\u77e5\u751f\u6210\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u610f\u751f\u6210\u987a\u5e8f\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728 ImageNet \u4e0a\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6b65\u9aa4\u4ece 256 \u51cf\u5c11\u5230 20\uff08256\u00d7256\uff09\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u81f3\u5c11 3.4 \u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "LPD \u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5e76\u884c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u3002"}}
