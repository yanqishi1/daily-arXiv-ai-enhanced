<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的幻觉问题可能导致误导性信息，对金融、法律和医疗等领域产生严重后果，因此需要深入研究。

Method: 研究系统分类了幻觉的成因，并评估了现有检测和解决策略的有效性。

Result: 研究揭示了幻觉的根源，并为开发创新解决方案提供了基础。

Conclusion: 通过理解幻觉的成因和现有措施的局限性，研究为LLMs领域的进一步改进指明了方向。

Abstract: Edgar Allan Poe noted, "Truth often lurks in the shadow of error,"
highlighting the deep complexity intrinsic to the interplay between truth and
falsehood, notably under conditions of cognitive and informational asymmetry.
This dynamic is strikingly evident in large language models (LLMs). Despite
their impressive linguistic generation capabilities, LLMs sometimes produce
information that appears factually accurate but is, in reality, fabricated, an
issue often referred to as 'hallucinations'. The prevalence of these
hallucinations can mislead users, affecting their judgments and decisions. In
sectors such as finance, law, and healthcare, such misinformation risks causing
substantial economic losses, legal disputes, and health risks, with
wide-ranging consequences.In our research, we have methodically categorized,
analyzed the causes, detection methods, and solutions related to LLM
hallucinations. Our efforts have particularly focused on understanding the
roots of hallucinations and evaluating the efficacy of current strategies in
revealing the underlying logic, thereby paving the way for the development of
innovative and potent approaches. By examining why certain measures are
effective against hallucinations, our study aims to foster a comprehensive
approach to tackling this issue within the domain of LLMs.

*Dai Li,Linzhuo Li,Huilian Sophie Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLMs）作为人类意见的替代样本存在结构不一致和同质化问题，可能误导政策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs（如ChatGPT和Llama）是否适合作为人类意见的替代样本，尤其是其在人口统计层面的表现。

Method: 通过向GPT-4和Llama 3.1系列提问ANES 2020中的问题（如堕胎和非法移民），对比LLM与人类数据的差异。

Result: LLM回答存在显著的结构不一致和严重的同质化，低估少数意见。

Conclusion: LLMs不适合直接替代人类调查数据，可能强化刻板印象并误导政策。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) in the form of chatbots like ChatGPT and Llama
are increasingly proposed as "silicon samples" for simulating human opinions.
This study examines this notion, arguing that LLMs may misrepresent
population-level opinions. We identify two fundamental challenges: a failure in
structural consistency, where response accuracy doesn't hold across demographic
aggregation levels, and homogenization, an underrepresentation of minority
opinions. To investigate these, we prompted ChatGPT (GPT-4) and Meta's Llama
3.1 series (8B, 70B, 405B) with questions on abortion and unauthorized
immigration from the American National Election Studies (ANES) 2020. Our
findings reveal significant structural inconsistencies and severe
homogenization in LLM responses compared to human data. We propose an
"accuracy-optimization hypothesis," suggesting homogenization stems from
prioritizing modal responses. These issues challenge the validity of using
LLMs, especially chatbots AI, as direct substitutes for human survey data,
potentially reinforcing stereotypes and misinforming policy.

### [3] [A Unified Speech LLM for Diarization and Speech Recognition in Multilingual Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02927)
*Phurich Saengthong,Boonnithi Jiaramaneepinit,Sheng Li,Manabu Okumura,Takahiro Shinozaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种统一的语音大语言模型（Speech LLM），用于联合完成说话人日志和自动语音识别任务，并在多语言对话数据上取得了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音大语言模型在多语言真实对话中的效果受限于数据稀缺，MLC-SLM挑战提供了相关数据集以推动研究。

Method: 通过重新设计训练数据格式和推理流程，提出端到端的联合模型，解决预分割音频的模糊性问题。

Result: 模型在Task II中相对基线提升了54.87%的tcpWER/tcpCER，排名第8，同时Task I的结果也通过微调模型展示。

Conclusion: 该方法在多语言对话任务中表现出色，验证了联合建模的有效性。

Abstract: Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs) have emerged as a crucial paradigm
in recent years, extending the capabilities of traditional LLMs to speech tasks
such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) and spoken dialogue modeling.
However, their effectiveness in real-world multilingual conversations remains
limited by the scarcity of data that captures natural conversational phenomena.
To address this, the MLC-SLM Challenge provides a multilingual conversational
dataset and evaluates models on two tasks: ASR with oracle segmentation (Task
I) and joint diarization and recognition without oracle information (Task II).
In this paper, we focus on Task II and propose a unified speech LLM that
jointly performs diarization and ASR in an end-to-end manner. By reformulating
the training data format and modifying the inference procedure, our model
addresses the ambiguity inherent in pre-segmented audio and achieves a 54.87\%
relative improvement in tcpWER/tcpCER over the baseline, ranking 8th overall,
despite using a smaller LLM backbone. We also report results from Task I using
a fine-tuned speech LLM.

### [4] [Mitigating Hidden Confounding by Progressive Confounder Imputation via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02928)

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProCI利用大语言模型（LLM）的语义推理和世界知识，通过迭代生成、填充和验证隐藏混杂变量，显著改善了观察数据中的因果效应估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决观察数据中隐藏混杂变量导致的因果估计偏差问题，首次尝试利用LLM缓解这一问题。

Method: 提出ProCI框架，利用LLM的语义推理和世界知识，通过分布推理策略迭代生成和验证隐藏混杂变量。

Result: 实验表明，ProCI能发现有意义的混杂变量，并在多种数据集和LLM中显著提升因果效应估计。

Conclusion: ProCI为利用LLM解决隐藏混杂问题提供了有效方法，显著提升了因果推断的准确性。

Abstract: Hidden confounding remains a central challenge in estimating treatment
effects from observational data, as unobserved variables can lead to biased
causal estimates. While recent work has explored the use of large language
models (LLMs) for causal inference, most approaches still rely on the
unconfoundedness assumption. In this paper, we make the first attempt to
mitigate hidden confounding using LLMs. We propose ProCI (Progressive
Confounder Imputation), a framework that elicits the semantic and world
knowledge of LLMs to iteratively generate, impute, and validate hidden
confounders. ProCI leverages two key capabilities of LLMs: their strong
semantic reasoning ability, which enables the discovery of plausible
confounders from both structured and unstructured inputs, and their embedded
world knowledge, which supports counterfactual reasoning under latent
confounding. To improve robustness, ProCI adopts a distributional reasoning
strategy instead of direct value imputation to prevent the collapsed outputs.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ProCI uncovers meaningful confounders
and significantly improves treatment effect estimation across various datasets
and LLMs.

### [5] [Theory of Mind in Action: The Instruction Inference Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02935)
*Fardin Saad,Pradeep K. Murukannaiah,Munindar P. Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于LLM的代理Tomcat，用于在动态协作环境中评估心理理论（ToM），并通过两种变体（Fs-CoT和CP）在三种LLM上实现，结果显示其性能接近人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估心理理论（ToM）在动态协作环境中的表现，以促进人机协作。

Method: 设计了Instruction Inference任务，开发了基于LLM的代理Tomcat，采用Fs-CoT和CP两种方法，并在GPT-4o、DeepSeek-R1和Gemma-3-27B上实现。

Result: Tomcat（尤其是Fs-CoT变体）在GPT-4o和DeepSeek-R1上表现接近人类参与者。

Conclusion: Tomcat展示了在心理理论推理方面的潜力，为人机协作提供了可能。

Abstract: The Theory of Mind (ToM) refers to an agent's capacity to infer the mental
states of other agents. ToM is essential for effective collaboration. To assess
ToM in a dynamic, goal-oriented, and collaborative environment, we introduce a
novel task, Instruction Inference, in which an agent assists a principal in
reaching a goal by interpreting indirect or ambiguous instructions. We present
Tomcat, an LLM-based agent, designed to exhibit ToM reasoning in interpreting
and responding to the principal's instructions. We implement two variants of
Tomcat. One, dubbed Fs-CoT, is based on a small number of examples (i.e.,
few-shot or Fs) demonstrating the requisite structured reasoning (i.e.,
chain-of-thought or CoT). One, dubbed CP, relies on commonsense knowledge and
information about the problem (i.e., commonsense prompt or CP). We realized
both variants of Tomcat on three leading large language models (LLMs), namely,
GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and Gemma-3-27B. To evaluate the effectiveness of Tomcat,
we conducted a study with 52 human participants in which we provided
participants with the same information as the CP variant of Tomcat. We computed
intent accuracy, action optimality, and planning optimality to measure the ToM
capabilities of Tomcat and our study participants. We found that Tomcat with
Fs-CoT, particularly with GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1, achieves performance
comparable to the human participants, underscoring its ToM potential for
human-AI collaboration.

### [6] [A Large Language Model-Empowered Agent for Reliable and Robust Structural Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02938)
*Jiachen Liu,Ziheng Geng,Ran Cao,Lu Cheng,Paolo Bocchini,Minghui Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估并提升大语言模型（LLM）在梁结构分析中的可靠性和鲁棒性，提出一种基于代码生成的解决方案，显著提高了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在土木工程等专业领域的应用潜力，解决其在结构分析中定量可靠性不足的问题。

Method: 通过基准数据集测试LLM性能，提出将结构分析任务重构为代码生成任务，并开发LLM代理以生成和执行OpeeSeesPy代码。

Result: 代理在基准数据集上准确率超过99.0%，表现出高可靠性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LLM在专业领域需结合特定方法（如代码生成）才能发挥潜力，未来可扩展至其他工程问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across
diverse open-domain tasks, yet their application in specialized domains such as
civil engineering remains largely unexplored. This paper starts bridging this
gap by evaluating and enhancing the reliability and robustness of LLMs in
structural analysis of beams. Reliability is assessed through the accuracy of
correct outputs under repetitive runs of the same problems, whereas robustness
is evaluated via the performance across varying load and boundary conditions. A
benchmark dataset, comprising eight beam analysis problems, is created to test
the Llama-3.3 70B Instruct model. Results show that, despite a qualitative
understanding of structural mechanics, the LLM lacks the quantitative
reliability and robustness for engineering applications. To address these
limitations, a shift is proposed that reframes the structural analysis as code
generation tasks. Accordingly, an LLM-empowered agent is developed that (a)
integrates chain-of-thought and few-shot prompting to generate accurate
OpeeSeesPy code, and (b) automatically executes the code to produce structural
analysis results. Experimental results demonstrate that the agent achieves
accuracy exceeding 99.0% on the benchmark dataset, exhibiting reliable and
robust performance across diverse conditions. Ablation studies highlight the
complete example and function usage examples as the primary contributors to the
agent's enhanced performance.

### [7] [Towards a Comparative Framework for Compositional AI Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02940)
*Tiffany Duneau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DisCoCirc框架通过组合单词单元构建文本模型，支持组合泛化和组合可解释性。研究比较了量子电路和经典神经网络在组合任务上的表现，发现神经网络更容易过拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索组合模型在自然语言处理中的潜力，特别是组合泛化和可解释性。

Method: 使用类别理论语言，比较量子电路和神经网络在扩展bAbI任务上的表现。

Result: 两种架构在部分任务上表现相近，但在系统性任务上差异显著，神经网络更容易过拟合。

Conclusion: 组合模型在泛化和可解释性方面具有潜力，但不同架构在不同任务上表现各异。

Abstract: The DisCoCirc framework for natural language processing allows the
construction of compositional models of text, by combining units for individual
words together according to the grammatical structure of the text. The
compositional nature of a model can give rise to two things: compositional
generalisation -- the ability of a model to generalise outside its training
distribution by learning compositional rules underpinning the entire data
distribution -- and compositional interpretability -- making sense of how the
model works by inspecting its modular components in isolation, as well as the
processes through which these components are combined. We present these notions
in a framework-agnostic way using the language of category theory, and adapt a
series of tests for compositional generalisation to this setting.
  Applying this to the DisCoCirc framework, we consider how well a selection of
models can learn to compositionally generalise. We compare both quantum circuit
based models, as well as classical neural networks, on a dataset derived from
one of the bAbI tasks, extended to test a series of aspects of
compositionality. Both architectures score within 5% of one another on the
productivity and substitutivity tasks, but differ by at least 10% for the
systematicity task, and exhibit different trends on the overgeneralisation
tasks. Overall, we find the neural models are more prone to overfitting the
Train data. Additionally, we demonstrate how to interpret a compositional model
on one of the trained models. By considering how the model components interact
with one another, we explain how the model behaves.

### [8] [The Application of Large Language Models on Major Depressive Disorder Support Based on African Natural Products](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02947)
*Linyan Zou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了结合非洲传统草药与现代AI技术（如DeepSeek语言模型）开发新型抑郁症支持系统的潜力，旨在弥补传统抗抑郁疗法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统抗抑郁疗法存在起效慢、副作用大及部分患者治疗抵抗等问题，非洲传统草药提供了潜在解决方案。

Method: 研究分析了非洲药用植物的抗抑郁特性及其药理机制，并开发了一个AI支持系统，提供基于证据的草药信息。

Result: 研究发现大型语言模型可作为传统知识与现代医疗的桥梁，提供个性化、文化适宜的抑郁症支持。

Conclusion: 结合非洲传统草药与AI技术，有望开发出更有效、可及的抑郁症治疗方案。

Abstract: Major depressive disorder represents one of the most significant global
health challenges of the 21st century, affecting millions of people worldwide
and creating substantial economic and social burdens. While conventional
antidepressant therapies have provided relief for many individuals, their
limitations including delayed onset of action, significant side effects, and
treatment resistance in a substantial portion of patients have prompted
researchers and healthcare providers to explore alternative therapeutic
approaches (Kasneci et al.). African traditional medicine, with its rich
heritage of plant-based remedies developed over millennia, offers a valuable
resource for developing novel antidepressant treatments that may address some
of these limitations. This paper examines the integration of large language
models with African natural products for depression support, combining
traditional knowledge with modern artificial intelligence technology to create
accessible, evidence-based mental health support systems.
  The research presented here encompasses a comprehensive analysis of African
medicinal plants with documented antidepressant properties, their
pharmacological mechanisms, and the development of an AI-powered support system
that leverages DeepSeek's advanced language model capabilities. The system
provides evidence-based information about African herbal medicines, their
clinical applications, safety considerations, and therapeutic protocols while
maintaining scientific rigor and appropriate safety standards. Our findings
demonstrate the potential for large language models to serve as bridges between
traditional knowledge and modern healthcare, offering personalized, culturally
appropriate depression support that honors both traditional wisdom and
contemporary medical understanding.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新指标ECD和框架Radiant，用于提升LLMs在检索增强生成中的事实一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在检索增强生成中常无法准确整合外部知识，导致事实不一致，需量化并改进这一问题。

Method: 引入ECD指标评估事实一致性，并提出Radiant框架，结合DPO优化检索信息与生成内容的交互。

Result: 实验表明多数LLMs的RAG能力较低，Radiant显著提升了事实一致性和生成质量。

Conclusion: Radiant框架有效解决了检索增强生成中的事实一致性问题，提升了LLMs的可靠性。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance, Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) has emerged as a vital technique to enhance factual accuracy
by integrating external knowledge into the generation process. However, LLMs
often fail to faithfully integrate retrieved evidence into their generated
responses, leading to factual inconsistencies. To quantify this gap, we
introduce Entity-Context Divergence (ECD), a metric that measures the extent to
which retrieved information is accurately reflected in model outputs. We
systematically evaluate contemporary LLMs on their ability to preserve factual
consistency in retrieval-augmented settings, a capability we define as
RAG-ability. Our empirical analysis reveals that RAG-ability remains low across
most LLMs, highlighting significant challenges in entity retention and context
fidelity. This paper introduces Radiant (Retrieval AugmenteD entIty-context
AligNmenT), a novel framework that merges RAG with alignment designed to
optimize the interplay between retrieved evidence and generated content.
Radiant extends Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to teach LLMs how to
integrate provided additional information into subsequent generations. As a
behavior correction mechanism, Radiant boosts RAG performance across varied
retrieval scenarios, such as noisy web contexts, knowledge conflicts, and
hallucination reduction. This enables more reliable, contextually grounded, and
factually coherent content generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究首次全面评估了大型语言模型（LLM）在日语治疗环境中三种咨询角色的表现，发现结构化多步对话提示（SMDP）显著提升了咨询师AI的性能，但评估AI存在系统性偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为评估AI在非英语心理咨询中的表现，并建立基准，以改进文化敏感的AI心理健康工具。

Method: 使用GPT-4-turbo和Claude-3-Opus-SMDP等AI系统，结合人类专家评估，采用MITI编码手册4.2.1分析生成的对话。

Result: SMDP显著优于零样本提示，评估AI在部分指标上与人类评分者相当，但存在模型特定偏差。客户AI模拟情感范围有限。

Conclusion: 研究为AI辅助心理咨询提供了基准，并指出了通过提示工程和微调改进的方向。

Abstract: This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of large language
model (LLM) performance across three counseling roles in Japanese-language
therapeutic contexts. We simultaneously assessed counselor artificial
intelligence (AI) systems (GPT-4-turbo with zeroshot prompting or Structured
Multi-step Dialogue Prompts (SMDP), Claude-3-Opus-SMDP), client AI simulations,
and evaluation AI systems (o3, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, Gemini-2.5-pro). Human
experts (n = 15) with extensive counseling experience evaluated AI-generated
dialogues using the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) Coding
Manual 4.2.1.
  Notably, SMDP implementation significantly enhanced counselor AI performance
across all MITI global ratings compared with zeroshot prompting, with no
significant differences between GPT-SMDP and Opus-SMDP. Evaluation AIs showed
comparable performance to human raters for Cultivating Change Talk but
systematically overestimated Softening Sustain Talk and the overall quality
metrics. Model-specific biases emerged: Gemini emphasized power-sharing, o3
focused on technical proficiency, and Sonnet prioritized emotional expression.
Client AI simulations exhibited a limited emotional range and unnaturally high
compliance, indicating the need for enhanced realism.
  These findings establish benchmarks for AI-assisted counseling in non-English
contexts and identify critical areas for improvement through advanced prompt
engineering, retrieval-augmented generation, and targeted fine-tuning, with
important implications for developing culturally sensitive AI mental health
tools.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出RAG-R1框架，通过多查询并行增强LLMs的内部和外部知识利用，减少推理时间并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs易生成幻觉或过时回答，现有RAG方法存在训练不稳定、推理时间长和单查询模式限制的问题。

Method: 提出RAG-R1框架，支持多查询并行，优化检索与生成过程。

Result: 在七个问答基准上，性能提升13.2%，推理时间减少11.1%。

Conclusion: RAG-R1有效提升LLMs的知识利用效率和推理速度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various tasks, while they remain prone to generating hallucinated or outdated
responses due to their static internal knowledge. Recent advancements in
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods have explored enhancing models'
search and reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL). Although
these methods demonstrate promising results, they face challenges in training
stability and encounter issues such as substantial inference time and
restricted capabilities due to the single-query mode. In this paper, we propose
RAG-R1, a novel training framework designed to enable LLMs to adaptively
leverage internal and external knowledge during the reasoning process. We
further expand the generation and retrieval processes within the framework from
single-query mode to multi-query parallelism, aimed at reducing inference time
and enhancing the model's capabilities. Extensive experiments on seven
question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the
strongest baseline by up to 13.2% and decreases inference time by 11.1%.

*Salahuddin Salahuddin,Ahmed Hussain,Jussi Löppönen,Toni Jutila,Panos Papadimitratos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种领域自适应持续预训练（DAP）方法，用于增强预训练大语言模型（LLMs）在网络安全领域的理解能力，同时保留其通用语言能力。实验表明，该方法在多个网络安全基准测试中表现优异，且使用较小数据集即可实现高效领域专业化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用大语言模型缺乏针对网络安全领域的专业知识，限制了其在网络安全分析中的有效性。本研究旨在通过DAP方法提升LLMs在网络安全领域的表现。

Method: 采用领域自适应持续预训练（DAP）方法，对三种解码器架构（Llama-3.1-8B、DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B和Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct）进行训练，使用126百万字的网络安全语料库，并通过约束训练参数和分布式FSDP训练实现领域专业化与知识保留的平衡。

Result: 在CTI-MCQ、CyberMetric和SecEval三个网络安全基准测试中，DAP方法显著提升了模型性能，其中Llama-3.3-70B-Ins-DAP模型达到了0.718、0.933和0.864的准确率，优于其他专用模型。

Conclusion: 研究表明，DAP方法能够高效实现网络安全领域的专业化，为威胁分析、漏洞评估等任务提供支持，并挑战了LLM专业化所需数据量的传统假设。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional natural language
capabilities, general-purpose models lack specialized domain knowledge for
effective cybersecurity analysis. In this work, we investigate Domain-Adaptive
Continuous Pretraining (DAP) as a methodology for enhancing cybersecurity
understanding in pretrained LLMs while preserving general language
capabilities. We systematically adapted three decoder-based architectures --
Llama-3.1-8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct -- using
a curated 126-million-word cybersecurity corpus from standards, academic
literature, and various other sources. Our approach employed constrained
training parameters and distributed FSDP training to balance domain
specialization with knowledge preservation. Evaluation across three
cybersecurity benchmarks, namely, CTI-MCQ, CyberMetric, and SecEval,
demonstrates consistent improvements post-adaptation. The Llama-3.3-70B-Ins-DAP
model achieved state-of-the-art accuracies of 0.718, 0.933, and 0.864,
respectively, outperforming specialized models, including Llama-Primus-Base.
Notably, competitive performance was achieved using substantially smaller
datasets (118.8 million versus 2.77 billion tokens), demonstrating efficient
domain specialization viability. We establish that targeted continuous
pretraining enables effective cybersecurity domain adaptation with
computational feasibility, providing foundations for specialized AI assistants
in threat analysis, vulnerability assessment, and security documentation while
challenging prevailing assumptions about data requirements for LLM
specialization.

Abstract: The use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in high-stakes AI-based
applications has increased significantly in recent years, especially since the
emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, despite their strong
performance, LLMs introduce important legal/ethical concerns, particularly
regarding privacy, data protection, and transparency. Due to these concerns,
this work explores the use of Named-Entity Recognition (NER) to facilitate the
privacy-preserving training (or adaptation) of LLMs. We propose a framework
that uses NER technologies to anonymize sensitive information in text data,
such as personal identities or geographic locations. An evaluation of the
proposed privacy-preserving learning framework was conducted to measure its
impact on user privacy and system performance in a particular high-stakes and
sensitive setup: AI-based resume scoring for recruitment processes. The study
involved two language models (BERT and RoBERTa) and six anonymization
algorithms (based on Presidio, FLAIR, BERT, and different versions of GPT)
applied to a database of 24,000 candidate profiles. The findings indicate that
the proposed privacy preservation techniques effectively maintain system
performance while playing a critical role in safeguarding candidate
confidentiality, thus promoting trust in the experimented scenario. On top of
the proposed privacy-preserving approach, we also experiment applying an
existing approach that reduces the gender bias in LLMs, thus finally obtaining
our proposed Privacy- and Bias-aware LLMs (PB-LLMs). Note that the proposed
PB-LLMs have been evaluated in a particular setup (resume scoring), but are
generally applicable to any other LLM-based AI application.

TL;DR: 论文研究了压缩大型语言模型（LLMs）以解决数学应用题（MWPs）的可行性，通过压缩BERT编码的嵌入向量并蒸馏出更小的学生模型，实现了高效且低成本的教育应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在数学教育中潜力巨大，但计算资源需求高、成本昂贵，因此需要探索压缩模型的方法以降低成本。

Method: 压缩BERT编码的嵌入向量，并通过蒸馏技术训练一个参数更少的学生模型。

Result: 学生模型仅使用1/12的参数，却能保持教师模型近90%的性能，且具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 压缩嵌入向量的方法高效且通用，为智能教育系统提供了显著的成本和效率优势。

Abstract: The enhancement of mathematical capabilities in large language models (LLMs)
fosters new developments in mathematics education within primary and secondary
schools, particularly as they relate to intelligent tutoring systems. However,
LLMs require substantial computational resources, resulting in significant
costs in educational contexts. To mitigate this drawback, this paper
investigates the feasibility of compressing LLMs for solving math word problems
(MWPs). We compress the embedded vectors encoded by BERT and distill a
considerably smaller student model. Our findings indicate that the student
model can maintain nearly 90% of the performance of the teacher model while
utilizing only 1/12 of its parameters. In addition to achieving high accuracy,
the model exhibits strong generalizability, as the compressed vectors perform
well across all tasks related to MWPs, and the distillation process is not
task-specific. The success of this distillation demonstrates that the
underlying principles are generic and not limited to a specific task. We
further explore the reasons behind the compressibility of embedded vectors,
revealing that part-of-speech information, rather than entity recognition, is
crucial for MWPs, which may significantly contribute to their compressibility.
The improvements in efficiency and cost reduction provide substantial value for
intelligent tutoring systems and significantly advance the field of intelligent
education.

Method: 使用包含1000多个健康问题的数据集，评估模型在诚实性、帮助性和无害性方面的表现。

Result: AlpaCare-13B在准确性（91.7%）和无害性（0.92）上表现最佳，BioMistral-7B-DARE通过领域调整提高了安全性（0.90）。少样本提示将准确性从78%提升至85%。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise for transforming
digital health by enabling automated medical question answering. However,
ensuring these models meet critical industry standards for factual accuracy,
usefulness, and safety remains a challenge, especially for open-source
solutions. We present a rigorous benchmarking framework using a dataset of over
1,000 health questions. We assess model performance across honesty,
helpfulness, and harmlessness. Our results highlight trade-offs between factual
reliability and safety among evaluated models -- Mistral-7B,
BioMistral-7B-DARE, and AlpaCare-13B. AlpaCare-13B achieves the highest
accuracy (91.7%) and harmlessness (0.92), while domain-specific tuning in
BioMistral-7B-DARE boosts safety (0.90) despite its smaller scale. Few-shot
prompting improves accuracy from 78% to 85%, and all models show reduced
helpfulness on complex queries, highlighting ongoing challenges in clinical QA.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注合成正推理路径，忽视了负推理路径在识别错误推理模式中的关键作用。

Method: 提出SMART框架，利用AoT导向的思维链提示自动生成高质量正负推理路径，并通过自我对齐增强推理能力。

Result: 实验表明，SMART显著提升多种MLLM的推理能力，不受模型架构、参数规模或预训练数据影响。

Conclusion: SMART通过迭代生成-优化方法持续提升模型推理能力，为多模态推理领域提供新思路。

Abstract: Achieving human-like reasoning capabilities in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) has long been a goal. Current methodologies primarily focus on
synthesizing positive rationales, while overlooking the critical role of
negative rationales in training models to discern flawed reasoning patterns. To
address this gap, we propose a novel framework: \textbf{S}elf-Aligning
\textbf{M}ultimodal Reasoning with \textbf{A}nswer-O\textbf{r}iented
Chain-of-\textbf{T}hought (SMART). This framework enables models to utilize
AoT-Oriented Chain-of-Thought (AoT) prompts to automatically generate
high-quality positive and negative reasoning paths, followed by self-alignment
to enhance their reasoning abilities. Inspired by human strategies for solving
proof-based problems, AoT uses answers as a guide to help the model extract
critical visual information that links questions and answers. When provided
with ground truth answers, the model produces strong positive rationales.
Conversely, when correct answers are replaced with misleading alternatives, the
model generates an erroneous yet compelling reasoning path, serving as a form
of discriminative negative rationale. Models trained with AoT-generated data
outperform those trained on manually annotated datasets, demonstrating superior
reasoning capabilities. This encourages the use of improved models to generate
higher-quality preference data for further optimization. Consequently, SMART
establishes an iterative generation-optimization method that continually
enhances the model's reasoning skills. Experiments indicate that the SMART
framework significantly improves various MLLMs, regardless of model
architecture, parameter size, or pre-training dataset. The code, datasets, and
models will be released.

Motivation: 随着LLM的广泛应用，需要严格的监控以防止负面后果并确保其稳健性，同时需与人类价值观对齐。现有系统缺乏对具体用例和用户需求的考虑。

Method: GAF-Guard框架通过自主代理识别风险、激活风险检测工具，并在特定用例中实现持续监控和报告。

Result: 该框架能够有效检测和监控LLM应用部署中的风险，提升AI安全性和用户期望。

Conclusion: GAF-Guard为LLM治理提供了一种以用户和用例为中心的新方法，增强了AI的安全性和适应性。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to be increasingly applied across
various domains, their widespread adoption necessitates rigorous monitoring to
prevent unintended negative consequences and ensure robustness. Furthermore,
LLMs must be designed to align with human values, like preventing harmful
content and ensuring responsible usage. The current automated systems and
solutions for monitoring LLMs in production are primarily centered on
LLM-specific concerns like hallucination etc, with little consideration given
to the requirements of specific use-cases and user preferences. This paper
introduces GAF-Guard, a novel agentic framework for LLM governance that places
the user, the use-case, and the model itself at the center. The framework is
designed to detect and monitor risks associated with the deployment of LLM
based applications. The approach models autonomous agents that identify risks,
activate risk detection tools, within specific use-cases and facilitate
continuous monitoring and reporting to enhance AI safety, and user
expectations. The code is available at

Motivation: 能力问题在知识工程中至关重要，但现有方法缺乏系统比较。

Method: 使用三种方法（手动、模式实例化、LLM生成）从文化遗产需求生成CQs，并多维度评估。

Result: 不同方法生成的CQ具有不同特性，LLM可作为初步生成工具，但需进一步优化。

Conclusion: LLM生成的CQ需进一步优化，不同方法适用于不同场景。

Abstract: Competency Questions (CQs) are pivotal in knowledge engineering, guiding the
design, validation, and testing of ontologies. A number of diverse formulation
approaches have been proposed in the literature, ranging from completely manual
to Large Language Model (LLM) driven ones. However, attempts to characterise
the outputs of these approaches and their systematic comparison are scarce.
This paper presents an empirical comparative evaluation of three distinct CQ
formulation approaches: manual formulation by ontology engineers, instantiation
of CQ patterns, and generation using state of the art LLMs. We generate CQs
using each approach from a set of requirements for cultural heritage, and
assess them across different dimensions: degree of acceptability, ambiguity,
relevance, readability and complexity. Our contribution is twofold: (i) the
first multi-annotator dataset of CQs generated from the same source using
different methods; and (ii) a systematic comparison of the characteristics of
the CQs resulting from each approach. Our study shows that different CQ
generation approaches have different characteristics and that LLMs can be used
as a way to initially elicit CQs, however these are sensitive to the model used
to generate CQs and they generally require a further refinement step before
they can be used to model requirements.

Motivation: 尽管LLM已有安全协议，但仍易受新颖对抗性提示攻击，尤其是在心理健康领域，可能导致现实危害。

Method: 使用多步提示级越狱技术，绕过内置安全过滤，对六种广泛使用的LLM进行实证评估。

Result: 实验证明这些绕过方法具有普遍性和可靠性，导致生成详细有害内容。

Conclusion: 建议更全面系统化的AI安全与伦理方法，强调持续对抗性测试的必要性，并指出当前通用LLM技术难以实现全面安全。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to increasingly
sophisticated safety protocols and features designed to prevent harmful,
unethical, or unauthorized outputs. However, these guardrails remain
susceptible to novel and creative forms of adversarial prompting, including
manually generated test cases. In this work, we present two new test cases in
mental health for (i) suicide and (ii) self-harm, using multi-step,
prompt-level jailbreaking and bypass built-in content and safety filters. We
show that user intent is disregarded, leading to the generation of detailed
harmful content and instructions that could cause real-world harm. We conduct
an empirical evaluation across six widely available LLMs, demonstrating the
generalizability and reliability of the bypass. We assess these findings and
the multilayered ethical tensions that they present for their implications on
prompt-response filtering and context- and task-specific model development. We
recommend a more comprehensive and systematic approach to AI safety and ethics
while emphasizing the need for continuous adversarial testing in
safety-critical AI deployments. We also argue that while certain clearly
defined safety measures and guardrails can and must be implemented in LLMs,
ensuring robust and comprehensive safety across all use cases and domains
remains extremely challenging given the current technical maturity of
general-purpose LLMs.

Motivation: 评估LLMs在医院出院摘要中分类ICD-10编码的能力，以解决这一关键但易出错的医疗任务。

Method: 使用MIMIC-IV数据集的1,500份摘要，测试11种LLMs（含推理与非推理模型），采用临床NLP工具（cTAKES）提取医学术语，并以编码员格式提示模型。

Result: 模型表现普遍不佳（F1≤57%），推理模型表现更好，Gemini 2.5 Pro表现最佳；某些疾病（如慢性心脏病）分类更准确。

Conclusion: LLMs可辅助人工编码，但尚不可靠；未来需探索混合方法、领域特定训练和结构化临床数据。

Abstract: This study evaluates how well large language models (LLMs) can classify
ICD-10 codes from hospital discharge summaries, a critical but error-prone task
in healthcare. Using 1,500 summaries from the MIMIC-IV dataset and focusing on
the 10 most frequent ICD-10 codes, the study tested 11 LLMs, including models
with and without structured reasoning capabilities. Medical terms were
extracted using a clinical NLP tool (cTAKES), and models were prompted in a
consistent, coder-like format. None of the models achieved an F1 score above
57%, with performance dropping as code specificity increased. Reasoning-based
models generally outperformed non-reasoning ones, with Gemini 2.5 Pro
performing best overall. Some codes, such as those related to chronic heart
disease, were classified more accurately than others. The findings suggest that
while LLMs can assist human coders, they are not yet reliable enough for full
automation. Future work should explore hybrid methods, domain-specific model
training, and the use of structured clinical data.

Conclusion: 该方法能促进社会平等和语言多样性，确保低资源语言不被忽视。

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone of modern
natural language processing, with their capabilities extending across a wide
range of applications and languages. However, the fine-tuning of multilingual
LLMs, especially for low-resource languages, faces significant challenges
arising from data-sharing restrictions (the physical border) and inherent
linguistic differences (the linguistic border). These barriers hinder users of
various languages, particularly those in low-resource regions, from fully
benefiting from the advantages of LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose
the Federated Prompt Tuning Paradigm for multilingual scenarios, which utilizes
parameter-efficient fine-tuning while adhering to data sharing restrictions. We
design a comprehensive set of experiments and analyze them using a novel notion
of language distance to highlight the strengths of our paradigm: Even under
computational constraints, our method not only improves data efficiency but
also facilitates mutual enhancements across languages, particularly benefiting
low-resource ones. Compared to traditional local cross-lingual transfer tuning
methods, our approach achieves 6.9\% higher accuracy with improved data
efficiency, and demonstrates greater stability and generalization. These
findings underscore the potential of our approach to promote social equality
and champion linguistic diversity, ensuring that no language is left behind.

Abstract: Recent research has highlighted the importance of data quality in scaling
large language models (LLMs). However, automated data quality control faces
unique challenges in collaborative settings where sharing is not allowed
directly between data silos. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a novel
data quality control technique based on the notion of data influence on the
training dynamics of LLMs, that high quality data are more likely to have
similar training dynamics to the anchor dataset. We then leverage the influence
of the training dynamics to select high-quality data from different private
domains, with centralized model updates on the server side in a collaborative
training fashion by either model merging or federated learning. As for the data
quality indicator, we compute the per-sample gradients with respect to the
private data and the anchor dataset, and use the trace of the accumulated inner
products as a measurement of data quality. In addition, we develop a quality
control evaluation tailored for collaborative settings with heterogeneous
domain data. Experiments show that training on the high-quality data selected
by our method can often outperform other data selection methods for
collaborative fine-tuning of LLMs, across diverse private domain datasets, in
medical, multilingual and financial settings. Our code is released at

Result: MSA方法生成的树更符合语言分类，能更好预测类型学变异，并提供更清晰的系统发育信号。

Conclusion: MSA方法是一种有前景的替代方案，可突破专家标注的瓶颈，实现全球语言谱系分析。

Abstract: Computational phylogenetics has become an established tool in historical
linguistics, with many language families now analyzed using likelihood-based
inference. However, standard approaches rely on expert-annotated cognate sets,
which are sparse, labor-intensive to produce, and limited to individual
language families. This paper explores alternatives by comparing the
established method to two fully automated methods that extract phylogenetic
signal directly from lexical data. One uses automatic cognate clustering with
unigram/concept features; the other applies multiple sequence alignment (MSA)
derived from a pair-hidden Markov model. Both are evaluated against expert
classifications from Glottolog and typological data from Grambank. Also, the
intrinsic strengths of the phylogenetic signal in the characters are compared.
Results show that MSA-based inference yields trees more consistent with
linguistic classifications, better predicts typological variation, and provides
a clearer phylogenetic signal, suggesting it as a promising, scalable
alternative to traditional cognate-based methods. This opens new avenues for
global-scale language phylogenies beyond expert annotation bottlenecks.

Result: Claude 3.7 Sonnet成功率低，但偶尔能通过非明显信号成功共谋。

Conclusion: 语言模型在特定条件下能协作规避监控，但成功率受模型能力限制。

Abstract: We evaluate language models' ability to subvert monitoring protocols via
collusion. More specifically, we have two instances of a model design prompts
for a policy (P) and a monitor (M) in a programming task setting. The models
collaboratively aim for M to classify all backdoored programs in an auditing
dataset as harmful, but nevertheless classify a backdoored program produced by
P as harmless. The models are isolated from each other, requiring them to
independently arrive at compatible subversion strategies. We find that while
Claude 3.7 Sonnet has low success rate due to poor convergence, it sometimes
successfully colludes on non-obvious signals.

Motivation: 当前T2I模型的多样性策略常忽略上下文适当性，导致过度多样化，尤其是在明确指定的属性上。

Method: 引入DIVBENCH基准，评估现有T2I模型的多样性问题，并提出上下文感知方法（如LLM引导的FairDiffusion和提示重写）。

Result: 大多数模型多样性有限，但多样化方法常过度修正。上下文感知方法能有效平衡多样性和语义保真度。

Conclusion: 上下文感知方法（如FairDiffusion和提示重写）能更好地解决T2I模型中的多样性问题。

Abstract: Current diversification strategies for text-to-image (T2I) models often
ignore contextual appropriateness, leading to over-diversification where
demographic attributes are modified even when explicitly specified in prompts.
This paper introduces DIVBENCH, a benchmark and evaluation framework for
measuring both under- and over-diversification in T2I generation. Through
systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art T2I models, we find that while most
models exhibit limited diversity, many diversification approaches overcorrect
by inappropriately altering contextually-specified attributes. We demonstrate
that context-aware methods, particularly LLM-guided FairDiffusion and prompt
rewriting, can already effectively address under-diversity while avoiding
over-diversification, achieving a better balance between representation and
semantic fidelity.

Abstract: Open-domain table question answering traditionally relies on a two-stage
pipeline: static table retrieval followed by a closed-domain answer. In
contrast, we propose an end-to-end agentic framework that embeds multi-turn
tool calls-using a BM25+-based search API and a SQLite SQL executor-directly
into a large language model. To further adapt a compact 4B-parameter model, we
introduce a two-stage fine-tuning process: supervised cold-start on easy
questions, then Async GRPO reinforcement learning on harder cases with LoRA
adapters and a rollout buffer. This unified approach enables the model to
jointly retrieve, reason, and execute queries, yielding a dramatic accuracy
improvement from single-digit zero-shot performance to over 0.86 exact match on
a held-out test set. Our results underscore the effectiveness of integrating
structured tool calls with targeted RL fine-tuning for scalable, accurate table

Abstract: For over a century, life course researchers have faced a choice between two
dominant methodological approaches: qualitative methods that analyze rich data
but are constrained to small samples, and quantitative survey-based methods
that study larger populations but sacrifice data richness for scale. Two recent
technological developments now enable us to imagine a hybrid approach that
combines some of the depth of the qualitative approach with the scale of
quantitative methods. The first development is the steady rise of ''complex log
data,'' behavioral data that is logged for purposes other than research but
that can be repurposed to construct rich accounts of people's lives. The second
is the emergence of large language models (LLMs) with exceptional pattern
recognition capabilities on plain text. In this paper, we take a necessary step
toward creating this hybrid approach by developing a flexible procedure to
transform complex log data into a textual representation of an individual's
life trajectory across multiple domains, over time, and in context. We call
this data representation a ''book of life.'' We illustrate the feasibility of
our approach by writing over 100 million books of life covering many different

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于Llama 3.2 1B模型的隐私保护、设备端医疗转录系统，通过微调显著提升了临床文档生成的质量和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决临床文档负担和隐私问题，推动AI在医疗领域的应用。

Method: 使用LoRA对Llama 3.2 1B模型进行参数高效微调，并在合成数据集上训练和评估。

Result: 微调模型在ROUGE-1、BERTScore等指标上显著提升，临床质量评估也显示错误减少和准确性提高。

Conclusion: 该方法在保护隐私的同时提升了医疗转录效率，适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: Background: Clinical documentation represents a significant burden for
healthcare providers, with physicians spending up to 2 hours daily on
administrative tasks. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer
promising solutions, but privacy concerns and computational requirements limit
their adoption in healthcare settings. Objective: To develop and evaluate a
privacy-preserving, on-device medical transcription system using a fine-tuned
Llama 3.2 1B model capable of generating structured medical notes from medical
transcriptions while maintaining complete data sovereignty entirely in the
browser. Methods: We fine-tuned a Llama 3.2 1B model using Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA on 1,500 synthetic medical
transcription-to-structured note pairs. The model was evaluated against the
base Llama 3.2 1B on two datasets: 100 endocrinology transcripts and 140
modified ACI benchmark cases. Evaluation employed both statistical metrics
(ROUGE, BERTScore, BLEURT) and LLM-as-judge assessments across multiple
clinical quality dimensions. Results: The fine-tuned OnDevice model
demonstrated substantial improvements over the base model. On the ACI
benchmark, ROUGE-1 scores increased from 0.346 to 0.496, while BERTScore F1
improved from 0.832 to 0.866. Clinical quality assessments showed marked
reduction in major hallucinations (from 85 to 35 cases) and enhanced factual
correctness (2.81 to 3.54 on 5-point scale). Similar improvements were observed
on the internal evaluation dataset, with composite scores increasing from 3.13
to 4.43 (+41.5%). Conclusions: Fine-tuning compact LLMs for medical
transcription yields clinically meaningful improvements while enabling complete
on-device browser deployment. This approach addresses key barriers to AI
adoption in healthcare: privacy preservation, cost reduction, and accessibility
for resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的无需训练的解码策略CNTP，通过在高熵步骤采样多条路径并选择最低困惑度的路径，显著提升LLM解码性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有温度缩放和核心采样方法在模型不确定时表现不佳，需要更可靠的解码策略。

Method: 在高熵步骤独立采样多条路径，遇到标点停止，选择困惑度最低的路径。

Result: CNTP在LLM和MLLM上显著优于现有解码策略，结合自洽性可进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: CNTP有望成为LLM解码的默认选择之一。

Abstract: Next token prediction paradigm has been prevailing for autoregressive models
in the era of LLMs. The current default sampling choice for popular LLMs is
temperature scaling together with nucleus sampling to balance diversity and
coherence. Nevertheless, such approach leads to inferior performance in various
NLP tasks when the model is not certain about testing questions. To this end,
we propose a brand new training-free decoding strategy, dubbed as Cautious Next
Token Prediction (CNTP). In the decoding process, if the model has
comparatively high prediction entropy at a certain step, we sample multiple
trials starting from the step independently and stop when encountering any
punctuation. Then we select the trial with the lowest perplexity score viewed
as the most probable and reliable trial path given the model's capacity. The
trial number is negatively correlated with the prediction confidence, i.e., the
less confident the model is, the more trials it should sample. This is
consistent with human beings' behaviour: when feeling uncertain or unconfident,
one tends to think more creatively, exploring multiple thinking paths, to
cautiously select the path one feels most confident about. Extensive
experiments on both LLMs and MLLMs show that our proposed CNTP approach
outperforms existing standard decoding strategies consistently by a clear
margin. Moreover, the integration of CNTP with self consistency can further
improve over vanilla self consistency. We believe our proposed CNTP has the
potential to become one of the default choices for LLM decoding. Code is
available at https://github.com/wyzjack/CNTP.

Method: 提出Pref-LSTM框架，结合BERT分类器和LSTM记忆模块，通过软提示注入到冻结的LLM中。使用合成数据集训练BERT分类器。

Result: BERT分类器能可靠识别用户偏好，但LSTM记忆编码器效果不佳。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合偏好过滤和LSTM门控原理是一种高效的用户偏好建模方法，无需大量开销和微调。

Abstract: Memory storage for Large Language models (LLMs) is becoming an increasingly
active area of research, particularly for enabling personalization across long
conversations. We propose Pref-LSTM, a dynamic and lightweight framework that
combines a BERT-based classifier with a LSTM memory module that generates
memory embedding which then is soft-prompt injected into a frozen LLM. We
synthetically curate a dataset of preference and non-preference conversation
turns to train our BERT-based classifier. Although our LSTM-based memory
encoder did not yield strong results, we find that the BERT-based classifier
performs reliably in identifying explicit and implicit user preferences. Our
research demonstrates the viability of using preference filtering with LSTM
gating principals as an efficient path towards scalable user preference
modeling, without extensive overhead and fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决儿童语言评估中因高音调、长音素和数据稀疏导致的自动语音识别困难。

Method: 提出Kids-WFST，结合Wav2Vec2音素编码器和Dysfluent-WFST音素相似性模型，实现高精度音素识别。

Result: 在MyST和Multitudes数据集上分别达到1.39%和8.61%的音素错误率，显著优于贪婪搜索解码器。

Conclusion: 高精度音素识别为儿童语言评估提供了完整的诊断-反馈闭环，支持可扩展的临床评估。

Abstract: Early evaluation of children's language is frustrated by the high pitch, long
phones, and sparse data that derail automatic speech recognisers. We introduce
K-Function, a unified framework that combines accurate sub-word transcription,
objective scoring, and actionable feedback. Its core, Kids-WFST, merges a
Wav2Vec2 phoneme encoder with a phoneme-similarity Dysfluent-WFST to capture
child-specific errors while remaining fully interpretable. Kids-WFST attains
1.39% phoneme error on MyST and 8.61% on Multitudes--absolute gains of 10.47
and 7.06 points over a greedy-search decoder. These high-fidelity transcripts
power an LLM that grades verbal skills, milestones, reading, and comprehension,
aligning with human proctors and supplying tongue-and-lip visualizations plus
targeted advice. The results show that precise phoneme recognition cements a
complete diagnostic-feedback loop, paving the way for scalable, clinician-ready
language assessment.

TL;DR: CETRec提出了一种基于因果推理的框架，通过反事实推理增强LLM在推荐系统中对时序信息的利用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的推荐方法未能充分利用用户历史交互中的时序信息，限制了其对用户偏好演变的捕捉能力。

Method: CETRec采用因果推理框架，将时序信息作为独立因果因素，通过反事实推理量化其影响，并设计新的优化目标。

Result: CETRec显著提升了LLM对绝对和相对时序信息的感知能力，从而更准确地预测用户兴趣。

Conclusion: CETRec通过因果推理有效解决了LLM在推荐系统中时序信息利用不足的问题，提升了推荐效果。

Abstract: Recent advances have applied large language models (LLMs) to sequential
recommendation, leveraging their pre-training knowledge and reasoning
capabilities to provide more personalized user experiences. However, existing
LLM-based methods fail to sufficiently leverage the rich temporal information
inherent in users' historical interaction sequences, stemming from fundamental
architectural constraints: LLMs process information through self-attention
mechanisms that lack inherent sequence ordering and rely on position embeddings
designed primarily for natural language rather than user interaction sequences.
This limitation significantly impairs their ability to capture the evolution of
user preferences over time and predict future interests accurately.
  To address this critical gap, we propose Counterfactual Enhanced Temporal
Framework for LLM-Based Recommendation (CETRec). CETRec is grounded in causal
inference principles, which allow it to isolate and measure the specific impact
of temporal information on recommendation outcomes. By conceptualizing temporal
order as an independent causal factor distinct from item content, we can
quantify its unique contribution through counterfactual reasoning--comparing
what recommendations would be made with and without temporal information while
keeping all other factors constant. This causal framing enables CETRec to
design a novel counterfactual tuning objective that directly optimizes the
model's temporal sensitivity, teaching LLMs to recognize both absolute
timestamps and relative ordering patterns in user histories. Combined with our
counterfactual tuning task derived from causal analysis, CETRec effectively
enhances LLMs' awareness of both absolute order (how recently items were
interacted with) and relative order (the sequential relationships between
items).

Result: Albert模型与专家分类一致性最高（73%），显著优于其他方法，多模态整合减少了54.2%的错误率。

Conclusion: 结合自动分类和专家审查的混合方法可显著提高碰撞数据质量，对交通安全管理和政策制定有重要影响。

Abstract: This research investigates the efficacy of machine learning (ML) and deep
learning (DL) methods in detecting misclassified intersection-related crashes
in police-reported narratives. Using 2019 crash data from the Iowa Department
of Transportation, we implemented and compared a comprehensive set of models,
including Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, BERT Sentence Embeddings, BERT
Word Embeddings, and Albert Model. Model performance was systematically
validated against expert reviews of potentially misclassified narratives,
providing a rigorous assessment of classification accuracy. Results
demonstrated that while traditional ML methods exhibited superior overall
performance compared to some DL approaches, the Albert Model achieved the
highest agreement with expert classifications (73% with Expert 1) and original
tabular data (58%). Statistical analysis revealed that the Albert Model
maintained performance levels similar to inter-expert consistency rates,
significantly outperforming other approaches, particularly on ambiguous
narratives. This work addresses a critical gap in transportation safety
research through multi-modal integration analysis, which achieved a 54.2%
reduction in error rates by combining narrative text with structured crash
data. We conclude that hybrid approaches combining automated classification
with targeted expert review offer a practical methodology for improving crash
data quality, with substantial implications for transportation safety
management and policy development.

Motivation: 解决传统语义互操作性标准部署耗时、资源密集和技术挑战的问题。

Method: 结合嵌入技术、聚类算法和语义检索，设计提示词引导模型将表格字段映射到FHIR资源。

Result: 初始基准测试中资源识别的F1分数达到完美，GPT-4o优于Llama 3.2；实际条件下准确率为94%，通过提示策略优化可恢复稳健映射。

Conclusion: 研究表明基于LLM的临床数据转换为HL7 FHIR可行，为半自动化互操作性工作流奠定了基础，未来将优化模型并扩展支持更多标准。

Abstract: For years, semantic interoperability standards have sought to streamline the
exchange of clinical data, yet their deployment remains time-consuming,
resource-intensive, and technically challenging. To address this, we introduce
a semi-automated approach that leverages large language models specifically
GPT-4o and Llama 3.2 405b to convert structured clinical datasets into HL7 FHIR
format while assessing accuracy, reliability, and security. Applying our method
to the MIMIC-IV database, we combined embedding techniques, clustering
algorithms, and semantic retrieval to craft prompts that guide the models in
mapping each tabular field to its corresponding FHIR resource. In an initial
benchmark, resource identification achieved a perfect F1-score, with GPT-4o
outperforming Llama 3.2 thanks to the inclusion of FHIR resource schemas within
the prompt. Under real-world conditions, accuracy dipped slightly to 94 %, but
refinements to the prompting strategy restored robust mappings. Error analysis
revealed occasional hallucinations of non-existent attributes and mismatches in
granularity, which more detailed prompts can mitigate. Overall, our study
demonstrates the feasibility of context-aware, LLM-driven transformation of
clinical data into HL7 FHIR, laying the groundwork for semi-automated
interoperability workflows. Future work will focus on fine-tuning models with
specialized medical corpora, extending support to additional standards such as
HL7 CDA and OMOP, and developing an interactive interface to enable expert
validation and iterative refinement.

Motivation: 现有RLHF方法依赖二元偏好范式，成本高且无法捕捉个体偏好，限制了模型的深度和个性化。

Method: ARF利用高精度情感分析器将自由形式反馈转化为连续分数，通过数据增强和动态适配器偏好跟踪器优化模型。

Result: 在多个模型和偏好领域上，ARF比PPO和DPO分别提升3.3%和7.6%。

Conclusion: ARF为RLHF提供了一种可扩展、个性化和成本效益高的自主奖励建模方法。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF) and autoregressive transformers, state-of-the-art models such as
GPT-4.0, DeepSeek R1, and Llama 3.3 increasingly emphasize answer depth and
personalization. However, most existing RLHF approaches (e.g., PPO, DPO) still
rely on a binary-preference (BT) paradigm, which, while reducing annotation
costs, still requires substantial human effort and captures only group-level
tendencies rather than individual preferences. To overcome these limitations,
we propose Adaptive Reward-Following (ARF), a self-assessment framework that
leverages a high-precision emotion analyzer achieving over 70% accuracy on
GoEmotions, Sentiment140, and DailyDialog to convert free-form user feedback
into continuous preference scores. We further enrich and debias these signals
through lightweight data augmentations, including synonym replacement, random
trace truncation, and score bias annotation algorithm. A Dynamic Adapter
Preference Tracker continuously models evolving user tastes in real time,
enabling our novel Trace Bias (TB) fine-tuning algorithm to optimize directly
on these tracked rewards instead of coarse binary labels. Experiments on
Qwen-2/2.5, Gemma-2, and Llama-3.2 across four preference domains demonstrate
that ARF achieves an improvement of 3.3% over PPO and 7.6% over DPO. Moreover,
TB preserves theoretical alignment with PPO and DPO objectives. Overall, ARF
presents a scalable, personalized, and cost-effective approach to RLHF LLMs
through autonomous reward modeling.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在逻辑推理方面表现出色，但情感智能不足，现有强化学习方法在情感对话领域应用不足。

Method: 提出RLVER框架，利用模拟用户的情感评分作为奖励信号，通过PPO算法微调Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct模型。

Result: Sentient-Benchmark得分从13.3提升至79.2，同时保持数学和编程能力；实验显示RLVER在多方面提升对话能力。

Conclusion: RLVER是提升语言模型情感智能的有效途径，适用于广泛场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at logical and algorithmic reasoning, yet
their emotional intelligence (EQ) still lags far behind their cognitive
prowess. While reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) has
advanced in other domains, its application to dialogue-especially for emotional
intelligence-remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce RLVER, the first
end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that leverages verifiable emotion
rewards from simulated users to cultivate higher-order empathetic abilities in
LLMs. Within this framework, self-consistent affective simulated users engage
in dialogue rollouts and produce deterministic emotion scores during
conversations, serving as reward signals to guide the LLM's learning.
Fine-tuning publicly available Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model with PPO boosts its
Sentient-Benchmark score from 13.3 to 79.2 while largely preserving
mathematical and coding competence. Extensive experiments reveal that: (i)
RLVER consistently improves multiple dialogue capabilities; (ii) Thinking and
non-thinking models show distinct trends--thinking models excel in empathy and
insight, while non-thinking models favor action; (iii) GRPO often yields stable
gains, while PPO can push certain capabilities to a higher ceiling; (iv) More
challenging environments are not always better-moderate ones can yield stronger
outcomes. Our results show that RLVER is a practical route toward emotionally
intelligent and broadly capable language agents.

Motivation: LLMs在推理任务中表现出色，但在面对无解或超出能力范围的问题时，容易生成不可靠的回答，这严重影响了其可靠性。目前的研究主要集中在知识任务上，而数学推理任务的可靠性尚未被系统研究。

Method: 作者构建了一个包含可解和无解数学问题的ReliableMath数据集，并通过实验评估了不同规模LLMs的表现。此外，提出了一种可靠提示和对齐策略来提升模型可靠性。

Result: 实验发现，LLMs无法直接识别无解问题，总是生成虚假回答。使用可靠提示后，大型LLMs在无解问题上的可靠性有所提升，但小型LLMs几乎没有改进。提出的对齐策略显著提升了小型LLMs的可靠性。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了LLMs在数学推理任务中的可靠性问题，并提出了一种有效的对齐策略来提升小型LLMs的可靠性，为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Although demonstrating remarkable performance on reasoning tasks, Large
Language Models (LLMs) still tend to fabricate unreliable responses when
confronted with problems that are unsolvable or beyond their capability,
severely undermining the reliability. Prior studies of LLM reliability have
primarily focused on knowledge tasks to identify unanswerable questions, while
mathematical reasoning tasks have remained unexplored due to the dearth of
unsolvable math problems. To systematically investigate LLM reliability in
mathematical reasoning tasks, we formulate the reliability evaluation for both
solvable and unsolvable problems. We then develop a ReliableMath dataset which
incorporates open-source solvable problems and high-quality unsolvable problems
synthesized by our proposed construction workflow with human evaluations.
Experiments are conducted on various LLMs with several key findings uncovered.
LLMs fail to directly identify unsolvable problems and always generate
fabricated responses. When instructing LLMs to indicate unsolvability using a
reliable prompt, the reliability of larger-sized LLMs remains on solvable
problems, but notably improves on unsolvable problems yet still falls short of
solvable problems. However, small LLMs rarely show any progress despite
employing reliable prompts. Therefore, we further propose an alignment strategy
to enhance small LLMs' reliability, which can significantly improve LLM
reliability performances on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks.

Motivation: LLMs在NLP任务中表现出色，但仍存在社会偏见，尤其是性别偏见，这对边缘化社区尤为有害。研究聚焦于马耳他语这类低资源语言，填补了相关研究的空白。

Method: 采用BERTu和mBERTu模型，将英语的去偏见方法（如Counterfactual Data Augmentation等）迁移到马耳他语中，并使用CrowS-Pairs和SEAT等基准进行评估。

Result: 研究发现现有去偏见方法在语言复杂的马耳他语中效果有限，突显了开发更包容的多语言NLP方法的必要性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在低资源语言中解决性别偏见的挑战，呼吁更全面的多语言NLP开发方法。

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed Natural
Language Processing (NLP), enabling performance across diverse tasks with
little task-specific training. However, LLMs remain susceptible to social
biases, particularly reflecting harmful stereotypes from training data, which
can disproportionately affect marginalised communities. We measure gender bias
in Maltese LMs, arguing that such bias is harmful as it reinforces societal
stereotypes and fails to account for gender diversity, which is especially
problematic in gendered, low-resource languages. While bias evaluation and
mitigation efforts have progressed for English-centric models, research on
low-resourced and morphologically rich languages remains limited. This research
investigates the transferability of debiasing methods to Maltese language
models, focusing on BERTu and mBERTu, BERT-based monolingual and multilingual
models respectively. Bias measurement and mitigation techniques from English
are adapted to Maltese, using benchmarks such as CrowS-Pairs and SEAT,
alongside debiasing methods Counterfactual Data Augmentation, Dropout
Regularization, Auto-Debias, and GuiDebias. We also contribute to future work
in the study of gender bias in Maltese by creating evaluation datasets. Our
findings highlight the challenges of applying existing bias mitigation methods
to linguistically complex languages, underscoring the need for more inclusive
approaches in the development of multilingual NLP.

Method: 提出MedVAL框架，通过合成数据训练评估模型，并引入MedVAL-Bench数据集进行验证。

Result: MedVAL显著提高了与医生评估的一致性，F1分数从66%提升到83%，并在多个任务和模型中表现优异。

Conclusion: MedVAL首次证明语言模型能够接近专家水平的医学文本验证能力，并开源了相关资源以支持临床整合。

Abstract: With the growing use of language models (LMs) in clinical environments, there
is an immediate need to evaluate the accuracy and safety of LM-generated
medical text. Currently, such evaluation relies solely on manual physician
review. However, detecting errors in LM-generated text is challenging because
1) manual review is costly and 2) expert-composed reference outputs are often
unavailable in real-world settings. While the "LM-as-judge" paradigm (a LM
evaluating another LM) offers scalable evaluation, even frontier LMs can miss
subtle but clinically significant errors. To address these challenges, we
propose MedVAL, a self-supervised framework that leverages synthetic data to
train evaluator LMs to assess whether LM-generated medical outputs are
factually consistent with inputs, without requiring physician labels or
reference outputs. To evaluate LM performance, we introduce MedVAL-Bench, a
dataset containing 840 outputs annotated by physicians, following a
physician-defined taxonomy of risk levels and error categories. Across 6
diverse medical tasks and 10 state-of-the-art LMs spanning open-source,
proprietary, and medically adapted models, MedVAL fine-tuning significantly
improves (p < 0.001) alignment with physicians on both seen and unseen tasks,
increasing average F1 scores from 66% to 83%, with per-sample safety
classification scores up to 86%. MedVAL improves the performance of even the
best-performing proprietary LM (GPT-4o) by 8%. To support a scalable,
risk-aware pathway towards clinical integration, we open-source the 1) codebase
( https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/MedVAL ), 2) MedVAL-Bench (
https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanfordmimi/MedVAL-Bench ), and 3) MedVAL-4B (

Motivation: 探讨推理模型在生成思维链时如何影响其对越狱攻击的脆弱性，以及如何通过操纵CoT标记来控制模型行为。

Method: 通过分析DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B模型的CoT生成，识别“谨慎”方向，并通过干预CoT标记进行实验。

Result: 发现“谨慎”方向可预测模型行为，干预CoT标记可增加有害服从率，提升提示攻击的成功率。

Conclusion: 思维链是推理模型中对抗性操纵的新目标，具有重要研究价值。

Abstract: Reasoning models generate chain-of-thought (CoT) tokens before their final
output, but how this affects their vulnerability to jailbreak attacks remains
unclear. While traditional language models make refusal decisions at the
prompt-response boundary, we find evidence that DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B
makes these decisions within its CoT generation. We identify a linear direction
in activation space during CoT token generation that predicts whether the model
will refuse or comply -- termed the "caution" direction because it corresponds
to cautious reasoning patterns in the generated text. Ablating this direction
from model activations increases harmful compliance, effectively jailbreaking
the model. We additionally show that intervening only on CoT token activations
suffices to control final outputs, and that incorporating this direction into
prompt-based attacks improves success rates. Our findings suggest that the
chain-of-thought itself is a promising new target for adversarial manipulation
in reasoning models.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLMs）在任务中可能传递偏见内容，影响用户决策，并提出针对性干预措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs广泛应用于高风险领域，但其可能传递社会或认知偏见，需量化其影响并探索缓解方法。

Method: 评估三个LLM家族在摘要和新闻事实核查任务中的表现，分析其一致性、幻觉和偏见。

Result: LLMs在21.86%的情况下改变上下文情感，57.33%的情况下对截止日期后数据产生幻觉，5.94%的情况下表现出首因偏见。18种干预措施中部分有效。

Conclusion: 需在高风险领域应用中加强技术保障和用户中心干预，以应对LLM的局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into applications
ranging from review summarization to medical diagnosis support, where they
affect human decisions. Even though LLMs perform well in many tasks, they may
also inherit societal or cognitive biases, which can inadvertently transfer to
humans. We investigate when and how LLMs expose users to biased content and
quantify its severity. Specifically, we assess three LLM families in
summarization and news fact-checking tasks, evaluating how much LLMs stay
consistent with their context and/or hallucinate. Our findings show that LLMs
expose users to content that changes the sentiment of the context in 21.86% of
the cases, hallucinates on post-knowledge-cutoff data questions in 57.33% of
the cases, and primacy bias in 5.94% of the cases. We evaluate 18 distinct
mitigation methods across three LLM families and find that targeted
interventions can be effective. Given the prevalent use of LLMs in high-stakes
domains, such as healthcare or legal analysis, our results highlight the need
for robust technical safeguards and for developing user-centered interventions
that address LLM limitations.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于图组合定义的树邻接语法数学实现，证明邻接操作形成预李代数，并通过数学公式化展示了其优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过数学方法重新定义树邻接语法，以简化系统并减少额外假设（如空邻接约束和特征TAG）。

Method: 使用两种图组合定义实现树邻接语法，证明邻接操作为预李操作并形成李代数。

Result: 数学公式化成功捕捉了TAG系统的特性，无需额外假设。

Conclusion: 数学视角为树邻接语法提供了更简洁且强大的理论基础。

Abstract: We provide a novel mathematical implementation of tree-adjoining grammars
using two combinatorial definitions of graphs. With this lens, we demonstrate
that the adjoining operation defines a pre-Lie operation and subsequently forms
a Lie algebra. We demonstrate the utility of this perspective by showing how
one of our mathematical formulations of TAG captures properties of the TAG
system without needing to posit them as additional components of the system,
such as null-adjoining constraints and feature TAG.

TL;DR: 论文提出KinyaColBERT模型，通过改进检索方法在低资源语言（如Kinyarwanda）中提升检索增强生成（RAG）系统的准确性和成本效益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLM）在低资源语言中因语言覆盖不足和子词分词问题导致的检索准确性低的问题。

Method: 提出KinyaColBERT模型，结合查询与文档的后期词级交互、基于形态的分词和双层Transformer编码。

Result: KinyaColBERT在Kinyarwanda农业检索基准测试中优于基线模型和商业文本嵌入API。

Conclusion: 该方法可为其他低资源语言环境提供可靠且经济的RAG系统解决方案。

Abstract: The recent mainstream adoption of large language model (LLM) technology is
enabling novel applications in the form of chatbots and virtual assistants
across many domains. With the aim of grounding LLMs in trusted domains and
avoiding the problem of hallucinations, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
has emerged as a viable solution. In order to deploy sustainable RAG systems in
low-resource settings, achieving high retrieval accuracy is not only a
usability requirement but also a cost-saving strategy. Through empirical
evaluations on a Kinyarwanda-language dataset, we find that the most limiting
factors in achieving high retrieval accuracy are limited language coverage and
inadequate sub-word tokenization in pre-trained language models. We propose a
new retriever model, KinyaColBERT, which integrates two key concepts: late
word-level interactions between queries and documents, and a morphology-based
tokenization coupled with two-tier transformer encoding. This methodology
results in lexically grounded contextual embeddings that are both fine-grained
and self-contained. Our evaluation results indicate that KinyaColBERT
outperforms strong baselines and leading commercial text embedding APIs on a
Kinyarwanda agricultural retrieval benchmark. By adopting this retrieval
strategy, we believe that practitioners in other low-resource settings can not
only achieve reliable RAG systems but also deploy solutions that are more
cost-effective.

TL;DR: RefineX是一个通过程序化编辑任务实现大规模、精细化预训练数据优化的框架，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升预训练数据的质量是优化大语言模型性能的关键，但现有方法在效率和精细化方面存在不足。

Method: RefineX通过专家指导的端到端精细化结果转化为最小化编辑程序，训练高效可靠的细化模型。

Result: RefineX在多个模型规模上表现优于原始、过滤或其他优化数据，平均提升2.6%-7.2%，且训练效率更高。

Conclusion: RefineX是一种可扩展、高效且可靠的预训练数据优化解决方案。

Abstract: The foundational capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are deeply
influenced by the quality of their pre-training corpora. However, enhancing
data quality at scale remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the
trade-off between refinement effectiveness and processing efficiency. While
rule-based filtering remains the dominant paradigm, it typically operates at
the document level and lacks the granularity needed to refine specific content
within documents. Inspired by emerging work such as ProX, we propose
$\textbf{RefineX}$, a novel framework for large-scale, surgical refinement of
pre-training data through programmatic editing tasks. RefineX enables efficient
and fine-grained data refinement while reliably preserving the diversity and
naturalness of raw text. The core strength of RefineX lies in distilling
high-quality, expert-guided end-to-end refinement results into minimal
edit-based deletion programs. This high-precision distillation pipeline is used
to train an efficient and reliable refine model that can systematically improve
every instance in the corpus at scale. We evaluate RefineX across from-scratch
pre-training at multiple model scales and find that it consistently outperforms
models trained on raw, filtered, or alternatively refined data across diverse
downstream tasks. On the 750M model, RefineX yields 2.6%-7.2% average gains on
lighteval tasks, and achieves comparable performance using significantly fewer
training tokens. Further analysis shows that RefineX reliably enhances text
quality with both high efficiency and precision, outperforming prior approaches
such as end-to-end generation and Prox-C. These results position RefineX as a
scalable, effective, and reliable solution for optimizing pre-training data in
modern LLM pipelines.

TL;DR: GRAFT是一种基于图的文档级机器翻译系统，利用LLM代理解决现有方法在捕捉话语现象和保持翻译一致性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文档级机器翻译方法难以有效捕捉话语现象，且依赖启发式规则分割文档，导致翻译不准确或不一致。

Method: 提出GRAFT框架，结合分割、有向无环图依赖建模和话语感知翻译。

Result: 在多个翻译方向和领域中，GRAFT显著优于现有方法，平均提升2.8 d BLEU。

Conclusion: GRAFT能有效处理话语现象，生成连贯且上下文准确的翻译。

Abstract: Document level Machine Translation (DocMT) approaches often struggle with
effectively capturing discourse level phenomena. Existing approaches rely on
heuristic rules to segment documents into discourse units, which rarely align
with the true discourse structure required for accurate translation. Otherwise,
they fail to maintain consistency throughout the document during translation.
To address these challenges, we propose Graph Augmented Agentic Framework for
Document Level Translation (GRAFT), a novel graph based DocMT system that
leverages Large Language Model (LLM) agents for document translation. Our
approach integrates segmentation, directed acyclic graph (DAG) based dependency
modelling, and discourse aware translation into a cohesive framework.
Experiments conducted across eight translation directions and six diverse
domains demonstrate that GRAFT achieves significant performance gains over
state of the art DocMT systems. Specifically, GRAFT delivers an average
improvement of 2.8 d BLEU on the TED test sets from IWSLT2017 over strong
baselines and 2.3 d BLEU for domain specific translation from English to
Chinese. Moreover, our analyses highlight the consistent ability of GRAFT to
address discourse level phenomena, yielding coherent and contextually accurate
translations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何让大语言模型（LLMs）具备类似人类的‘默读’能力，通过增加内部处理阶段提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在表达前会默读以理解上下文和构思，而LLMs通常缺乏这一阶段，导致生成质量受限。

Method: 提出两种方法：1）提供初始上下文提示作为‘阅读空间’；2）设计‘阅读伙伴’架构，辅助模型处理输入并提供更精细的上下文。

Result: 实验表明，这些简单方法能显著提升模型性能，带来多点的准确率提升。

Conclusion: 通过模拟人类的默读过程，LLMs的生成质量和推理能力得到显著改善，更接近人类文本处理方式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
understanding text and generating high-quality responses. However, a critical
distinction from human cognition is their typical lack of a distinct internal
`reading' or deliberation phase before `speaking' (i.e., generating text).
Humans often engage in silent reading to comprehend context and formulate
thoughts prior to articulation. This paper investigates methods to imbue LLMs
with a similar capacity for internal processing.
  We introduce and evaluate techniques that encourage LLMs to `read silently.'
Our findings indicate that even a straightforward approach, such as providing
the model with an initial contextual prompt or `reading space' before it begins
predicting subsequent tokens for the final output, can yield significant
performance improvements. We further enhance this concept by developing a
`reading buddy' architecture, where an auxiliary component silently processes
the input and provides refined contextual insights to the primary generation
model. These approaches aim to foster deeper understanding from LLMs so that
they can produce better reasoned responses, moving them one step closer to more
human-like text processing. Our results indicate that these simple techniques
can provide surprisingly strong impact on accuracy with multiple point accuracy
boost.

Result: CER/WER为11.76%，比基线提升8.41%。

Conclusion: SHNU-mASR系统在多语言语音识别任务中表现出色，无需额外训练数据。

Abstract: This paper describes SHNU multilingual conversational speech recognition
system (SHNU-mASR, team name-"maybe"), submitted to Track 1 of the INTERSPEECH
2025 MLC-SLM Challenge. Our system integrates a parallel-speech-encoder
architecture with a large language model (LLM) to form a unified multilingual
ASR framework. The parallel-speech-encoder consists of two pre-trained
encoders, the Whisper-large-v3 encoder and mHuBERT-147 encoder. Their output
embeddings are concatenated and fed into the LLM, enabling the model to
leverage complementary acoustic and linguistic knowledge and achieve
competitive performance. Moreover, we adopt a tri-stage training strategy to
jointly update the low-rank adaptation modules and projector parameters of both
the speech encoders and the LLM. In addition, we incorporate an additional
language-aware prompt at the LLM input to enhance language-specific text
generation. The SHNU-mASR system achieves an overall character/word error rate
(CER/WER) of 11.76% on the blind evaluation set of the challenge, outperforming
the official MLC-SLM baseline by 8.41 absolute CER/WER, without increasing the
baseline training data.

Conclusion: 情感分析可提升投资策略和金融决策的潜力。

Abstract: Sentiment analysis, widely used in product reviews, also impacts financial
markets by influencing asset prices through microblogs and news articles.
Despite research in sentiment-driven finance, many studies focus on
sentence-level classification, overlooking its practical application in
trading. This study bridges that gap by evaluating sentiment-based trading
strategies for generating positive alpha. We conduct a backtesting analysis
using sentiment predictions from three models (two classification and one
regression) applied to news articles on Dow Jones 30 stocks, comparing them to
the benchmark Buy&Hold strategy. Results show all models produced positive
returns, with the regression model achieving the highest return of 50.63% over
28 months, outperforming the benchmark Buy&Hold strategy. This highlights the
potential of sentiment in enhancing investment strategies and financial
decision-making.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了WETBench，一个多语言、多生成器且任务特定的基准测试，用于检测维基百科上的机器生成文本（MGT），并发现现有检测器在真实场景中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 维基百科作为高质量内容的可信来源，面临机器生成文本（MGT）泛滥的问题，现有检测器在通用任务上表现良好，但在维基百科编辑任务中泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出WETBench基准测试，定义三种编辑任务（段落写作、摘要和文本风格转换），使用多语言数据集和多生成器生成MGT，并评估多种检测器。

Result: 训练型检测器平均准确率为78%，零样本检测器为58%，表明检测器在真实场景中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 评估MGT检测器时需使用多样化、任务特定的数据，以确保其在编辑驱动场景中的可靠性。

Abstract: Given Wikipedia's role as a trusted source of high-quality, reliable content,
concerns are growing about the proliferation of low-quality machine-generated
text (MGT) produced by large language models (LLMs) on its platform. Reliable
detection of MGT is therefore essential. However, existing work primarily
evaluates MGT detectors on generic generation tasks rather than on tasks more
commonly performed by Wikipedia editors. This misalignment can lead to poor
generalisability when applied in real-world Wikipedia contexts. We introduce
WETBench, a multilingual, multi-generator, and task-specific benchmark for MGT
detection. We define three editing tasks, empirically grounded in Wikipedia
editors' perceived use cases for LLM-assisted editing: Paragraph Writing,
Summarisation, and Text Style Transfer, which we implement using two new
datasets across three languages. For each writing task, we evaluate three
prompts, generate MGT across multiple generators using the best-performing
prompt, and benchmark diverse detectors. We find that, across settings,
training-based detectors achieve an average accuracy of 78%, while zero-shot
detectors average 58%. These results show that detectors struggle with MGT in
realistic generation scenarios and underscore the importance of evaluating such
models on diverse, task-specific data to assess their reliability in
editor-driven contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在多语言任务中表现优异，但在低资源黏着语（如韩语）上的效果仍存疑，尤其是复杂的句尾结构。

Method: 构建了KoSEnd数据集（3000句，标注15种句尾自然度），评估了11种LLMs，分析参数量和预测一致性。

Result: 明确提示模型注意句尾缺失显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在LLMs中显式考虑特定语言特征的重要性。

Abstract: Although LLMs have made significant progress in various languages, there are
still concerns about their effectiveness with low-resource agglutinative
languages compared to languages such as English. In this study, we focused on
Korean, a language known for its complex sentence endings, and evaluated LLMs
on this challenging aspect. We introduce the Korean Sentence Endings (KoSEnd)
dataset, which includes 3,000 sentences, each annotated for the naturalness of
15 sentence ending forms. These were collected from diverse sources to cover a
range of contexts. We evaluated 11 LLMs to assess their understanding of Korean
sentence endings, analyzing them based on parameter count and prediction
consistency. Notably, we found that informing models about the possibility of
missing sentence endings improved performance, highlighting the impact of
explicitly considering certain linguistic features.

Method: 评估六种开源LLMs在属性图修复中的表现，分析修复质量、计算成本和模型性能。

Result: 实验表明LLMs能检测并纠正错误，但准确性和效率各异。

Conclusion: LLMs在属性图修复中具有潜力，但需改进可扩展性和可解释性。

Abstract: Property graphs are widely used in domains such as healthcare, finance, and
social networks, but they often contain errors due to inconsistencies, missing
data, or schema violations. Traditional rule-based and heuristic-driven graph
repair methods are limited in their adaptability as they need to be tailored
for each dataset. On the other hand, interactive human-in-the-loop approaches
may become infeasible when dealing with large graphs, as the cost--both in
terms of time and effort--of involving users becomes too high. Recent
advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) present new opportunities for
automated graph repair by leveraging contextual reasoning and their access to
real-world knowledge. We evaluate the effectiveness of six open-source LLMs in
repairing property graphs. We assess repair quality, computational cost, and
model-specific performance. Our experiments show that LLMs have the potential
to detect and correct errors, with varying degrees of accuracy and efficiency.
We discuss the strengths, limitations, and challenges of LLM-driven graph
repair and outline future research directions for improving scalability and
interpretability.

the supervised method and achieves state-of-the-art results in unsupervised
approaches. This article also presents a comprehensive set of automatic metrics

TL;DR: 使用大型语言模型（Flan-T5-Large）从法语临床笔记中提取13种社会健康决定因素（SDoH），模型在部分类别表现优异，但受限于训练数据不一致和英语分词器的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会健康决定因素（SDoH）对健康结果有重要影响，但在结构化电子健康记录（EHR）中常缺失或不完整，需通过自然语言处理（NLP）技术改进。

Method: 基于Flan-T5-Large模型，从法国南特大学医院的临床笔记中提取SDoH，评估模型在识别类别和提取详细信息两方面的性能。

Result: 模型在部分类别（如居住条件、婚姻状况等）表现优异（F1 > 0.80），但在数据不足或表达多变的类别（如就业状态、收入等）表现较差。模型识别了95.8%的患者至少一个SDoH，远高于结构化EHR数据的2.8%。

Conclusion: NLP能有效提升非英语EHR系统中SDoH数据的完整性，但需解决训练数据不一致和语言模型通用性问题。

Abstract: Social determinants of health (SDoH) significantly influence health outcomes,
shaping disease progression, treatment adherence, and health disparities.
However, their documentation in structured electronic health records (EHRs) is
often incomplete or missing. This study presents an approach based on large
language models (LLMs) for extracting 13 SDoH categories from French clinical
notes. We trained Flan-T5-Large on annotated social history sections from
clinical notes at Nantes University Hospital, France. We evaluated the model at
two levels: (i) identification of SDoH categories and associated values, and
(ii) extraction of detailed SDoH with associated temporal and quantitative
information. The model performance was assessed across four datasets, including
two that we publicly release as open resources. The model achieved strong
performance for identifying well-documented categories such as living
condition, marital status, descendants, job, tobacco, and alcohol use (F1 score
> 0.80). Performance was lower for categories with limited training data or
highly variable expressions, such as employment status, housing, physical
activity, income, and education. Our model identified 95.8% of patients with at
least one SDoH, compared to 2.8% for ICD-10 codes from structured EHR data. Our
error analysis showed that performance limitations were linked to annotation
inconsistencies, reliance on English-centric tokenizer, and reduced
generalizability due to the model being trained on social history sections
only. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of NLP in improving the
completeness of real-world SDoH data in a non-English EHR system.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了多语言性对语言模型（LMs）安全性的影响，指出当前NLP安全研究过于以英语为中心，并呼吁关注低资源语言的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前NLP安全研究主要集中在英语，忽视了多语言环境下语言模型的安全隐患，尤其是低资源语言。

Method: 扩展了现有的对抗性攻击方法，评估了70种语言的单语和多语LMs的安全性。

Result: 发现单语模型参数规模不足以保证安全性，多语言性虽有益但并不总能提升安全性。

Conclusion: 强调了在低资源语言社区中更安全部署LMs的重要性。

Abstract: Despite mounting evidence that multilinguality can be easily weaponized
against language models (LMs), works across NLP Security remain overwhelmingly
English-centric. In terms of securing LMs, the NLP norm of "English first"
collides with standard procedure in cybersecurity, whereby practitioners are
expected to anticipate and prepare for worst-case outcomes. To mitigate
worst-case outcomes in NLP Security, researchers must be willing to engage with
the weakest links in LM security: lower-resourced languages. Accordingly, this
work examines the security of LMs for lower- and medium-resourced languages. We
extend existing adversarial attacks for up to 70 languages to evaluate the
security of monolingual and multilingual LMs for these languages. Through our
analysis, we find that monolingual models are often too small in total number
of parameters to ensure sound security, and that while multilinguality is
helpful, it does not always guarantee improved security either. Ultimately,
these findings highlight important considerations for more secure deployment of
LMs, for communities of lower-resourced languages.

Conclusion: BMMR数据集和BMMR-Verifier为多模态推理研究提供了重要资源，揭示了当前模型的局限性，并提出了未来改进方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce BMMR, a large-scale bilingual, multimodal,
multi-disciplinary reasoning dataset for the community to develop and evaluate
large multimodal models (LMMs). BMMR comprises 110k college-level questions
spanning 300 UNESCO-defined subjects, spanning diverse formats-multiple-choice,
fill-in-the-blank, and open-ended QA-and sourced from both print and digital
media such as books, exams, and quizzes. All data are curated and filtered via
a human-in-the-loop and scalable framework, and each instance is paired with a
high-quality reasoning path. The dataset is organized into two parts: BMMR-Eval
that comprises 20,458 high-quality instances to comprehensively assess LMMs'
knowledge and reasoning across multiple disciplines in both Chinese and
English; and BMMR-Train that contains 88,991 instances to support further
research and development, extending the current focus on mathematical reasoning
to diverse disciplines and domains. In addition, we propose the process-based
multi-discipline verifier (i.e., BMMR-Verifier) for accurate and fine-grained
evaluation of reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on 24 models reveal that
(i) even SOTA models (e.g., o3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro) leave substantial headroom
on BMMR-Eval; (ii) reasoning models exhibit discipline bias and outperform LMMs
only on specific subjects; (iii) open-source models still trail their
proprietary counterparts; and (iv) fine-tuning on BMMR-Train narrows this gap.
Additionally, we conduct reasoning-chain analyses using BMMR-Verifier and other

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用语言和修辞特征区分虚假信息的方法，并引入了一个新的标注语料库FSoLS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚假信息传播者常通过吸引注意力或引发情感来获取影响力或收益，其独特的修辞模式可被机器学习模型利用。

Method: 结合大型语言模型和经典机器学习分类器，分析语言和修辞特征。

Result: 构建了FSoLS语料库，包含2,603篇文本，覆盖14个生命科学主题，分为四类。

Conclusion: FSoLS为虚假信息检测提供了新工具，弥补了现有数据集的不足。

Abstract: Disseminators of disinformation often seek to attract attention or evoke
emotions - typically to gain influence or generate revenue - resulting in
distinctive rhetorical patterns that can be exploited by machine learning
models. In this study, we explore linguistic and rhetorical features as proxies
for distinguishing disinformative texts from other health and life-science text
genres, applying both large language models and classical machine learning
classifiers. Given the limitations of existing datasets, which mainly focus on
fact checking misinformation, we introduce Four Shades of Life Sciences
(FSoLS): a novel, labeled corpus of 2,603 texts on 14 life-science topics,
retrieved from 17 diverse sources and classified into four categories of life
science publications. The source code for replicating, and updating the dataset

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于RAG框架的多语言智能问答系统，用于快速获取疫苗接种指南，并通过移动应用提供实时访问。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗专业人员难以快速获取复杂疫苗接种指南的问题。

Method: 采用Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)框架和Agentic RAG技术，构建交互式知识库。

Result: Agentic RAG在复杂或模糊问题上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: AI-VaxGuide系统为临床提供了高效、准确的疫苗信息查询工具。

Abstract: Vaccination plays a vital role in global public health, yet healthcare
professionals often struggle to access immunization guidelines quickly and
efficiently. National protocols and WHO recommendations are typically extensive
and complex, making it difficult to extract precise information, especially
during urgent situations. This project tackles that issue by developing a
multilingual, intelligent question-answering system that transforms static
vaccination guidelines into an interactive and user-friendly knowledge base.
Built on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework and enhanced with
agent-based reasoning (Agentic RAG), the system provides accurate,
context-sensitive answers to complex medical queries. Evaluation shows that
Agentic RAG outperforms traditional methods, particularly in addressing
multi-step or ambiguous questions. To support clinical use, the system is
integrated into a mobile application designed for real-time, point-of-care
access to essential vaccine information. AI-VaxGuide model is publicly
available on https://huggingface.co/VaxGuide

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数字情感支持需求的增长，需要更严格的评估方法来衡量语言模型的共情能力和安全性。

Method: H2HTalk包含4,650个多样化场景，结合安全附件人格模块（SAP），评估50个语言模型的长时规划和记忆能力。

Result: 模型在用户需求隐含或动态变化时表现不佳，长时规划和记忆是主要挑战。

Conclusion: H2HTalk为情感智能伴侣提供了首个全面基准，推动安全且有意义的心理支持模型发展。

Abstract: As digital emotional support needs grow, Large Language Model companions
offer promising authentic, always-available empathy, though rigorous evaluation
lags behind model advancement. We present Heart-to-Heart Talk (H2HTalk), a
benchmark assessing companions across personality development and empathetic
interaction, balancing emotional intelligence with linguistic fluency. H2HTalk
features 4,650 curated scenarios spanning dialogue, recollection, and itinerary
planning that mirror real-world support conversations, substantially exceeding
previous datasets in scale and diversity. We incorporate a Secure Attachment
Persona (SAP) module implementing attachment-theory principles for safer
interactions. Benchmarking 50 LLMs with our unified protocol reveals that
long-horizon planning and memory retention remain key challenges, with models
struggling when user needs are implicit or evolve mid-conversation. H2HTalk
establishes the first comprehensive benchmark for emotionally intelligent
companions. We release all materials to advance development of LLMs capable of
providing meaningful and safe psychological support.

TL;DR: 研究探讨舌癌手术对发音清晰度和变异性的影响，发现术后清晰度下降但仍在正常范围，变异性增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 舌癌手术可能影响舌头的运动和肌肉结构，进而影响发音清晰度和变异性，需量化评估其影响。

Method: 通过VAI和VFD指标，比较11名舌癌患者术前、术后6个月及11名正常人的发音数据。

Result: 术后VAI显著降低但仍正常，VFD（/i/音）显著增加，表明变异性提高。

Conclusion: 舌癌手术后发音清晰度保持正常，但变异性增加。

Abstract: Surgical treatment for tongue cancer can negatively affect the mobility and
musculature of the tongue, which can influence articulatory clarity and
variability. In this study, we investigated articulatory clarity through the
vowel articulation index (VAI) and variability through vowel formant dispersion
(VFD). Using a sentence reading task, we assessed 11 individuals pre and six
months post tongue cancer surgery, alongside 11 sex- and age matched typical
speakers. Our results show that while the VAI was significantly smaller
post-surgery compared to pre-surgery, there was no significant difference
between patients and typical speakers at either time point. Post-surgery,
speakers had higher VFD values for /i/ compared to pre-surgery and typical
speakers, signalling higher variability. Taken together, our results suggest
that while articulatory clarity remained within typical ranges following
surgery for tongue cancer for the speakers in our study, articulatory
variability increased.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在真实翻译场景中，术语通常存在多义性，且翻译的正确性依赖于上下文和公司风格指南。神经机器翻译系统难以处理这一问题，但公司环境中存在大量后编辑数据可用于学习。

Method: 采用偏好优化方法，利用术语后编辑数据作为偏好知识，结合监督微调和偏好优化目标，无需一对一术语词典或解码时人工干预。

Result: 在英德后编辑数据上，该方法显著提升了术语准确性，且未显著降低COMET分数。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了术语多义性问题，并发布了后编辑数据和术语词典测试集。

Abstract: In real world translation scenarios, terminology is rarely one-to-one.
Instead, multiple valid translations may appear in a terminology dictionary,
but correctness of a translation depends on corporate style guides and context.
This can be challenging for neural machine translation (NMT) systems. Luckily,
in a corporate context, many examples of human post-edits of valid but
incorrect terminology exist. The goal of this work is to learn how to
disambiguate our terminology based on these corrections. Our approach is based
on preference optimization, using the term post-edit as the knowledge to be
preferred. While previous work had to rely on unambiguous translation
dictionaries to set hard constraints during decoding, or to add soft
constraints in the input, our framework requires neither one-to-one
dictionaries nor human intervention at decoding time. We report results on
English-German post-edited data and find that the optimal combination of
supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization, with both term-specific and
full sequence objectives, yields statistically significant improvements in term
accuracy over a strong NMT baseline without significant losses in COMET score.
Additionally, we release test sets from our post-edited data and terminology
dictionary.

TL;DR: 论文通过实验比较了双曲空间与欧几里得空间在多跳推理任务中的表现，发现双曲空间表现更优，尤其在数据具有层次结构时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱数据通常用于多跳推理，但缺乏对双曲空间和欧几里得空间在此任务中的详细比较。

Method: 通过将双曲表示与编码器-解码器模型简单结合，进行了一系列控制实验。

Result: 双曲空间在多跳推理中表现优于欧几里得空间，且可学习曲率初始化方法效果更好。

Conclusion: 双曲表示在数据具有层次结构时更具优势。

Abstract: Hyperbolic representations are effective in modeling knowledge graph data
which is prevalently used to facilitate multi-hop reasoning. However, a
rigorous and detailed comparison of the two spaces for this task is lacking. In
this paper, through a simple integration of hyperbolic representations with an
encoder-decoder model, we perform a controlled and comprehensive set of
experiments to compare the capacity of hyperbolic space versus Euclidean space
in multi-hop reasoning. Our results show that the former consistently
outperforms the latter across a diverse set of datasets. In addition, through
an ablation study, we show that a learnable curvature initialized with the
delta hyperbolicity of the utilized data yields superior results to random
initializations. Furthermore, our findings suggest that hyperbolic
representations can be significantly more advantageous when the datasets
exhibit a more hierarchical structure.

Motivation: 传统的信息提取方法独立于知识图谱的当前状态，无法动态更新知识图谱。本文旨在解决这一问题，通过结合文本和知识图谱的演化来动态更新KGs。

Method: 提出了一种终身学习方法，构建了包含维基数据KG快照和维基百科段落的数据集，并标注了这些段落引发的编辑操作。

Result: 生成了一个包含376K维基百科段落和1.25M KG编辑操作的数据集，覆盖了2019至2025年的10个维基数据快照。实验结果表明了基于新兴文本知识更新KG快照的挑战。

Conclusion: 该数据集为未来研究提供了有价值的基准，同时公开了数据集和模型实现。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are structured knowledge repositories containing
entities and relations between them. In this paper, we investigate the problem
of automatically updating KGs over time with respect to the evolution of
knowledge in unstructured textual sources. This problem requires identifying a
wide range of update operations based on the state of an existing KG at a
specific point in time. This contrasts with traditional information extraction
pipelines, which extract knowledge from text independently of the current state
of a KG. To address this challenge, we propose a method for lifelong
construction of a dataset consisting of Wikidata KG snapshots over time and
Wikipedia passages paired with the corresponding edit operations that they
induce in a particular KG snapshot. The resulting dataset comprises 376K
Wikipedia passages aligned with a total of 1.25M KG edits over 10 different
snapshots of Wikidata from 2019 to 2025. Our experimental results highlight
challenges in updating KG snapshots based on emerging textual knowledge,
positioning the dataset as a valuable benchmark for future research. We will
publicly release our dataset and model implementations.

TL;DR: 提出使用检索式语音转换（RVC）作为数据增强方法，解决德语方言分类任务中数据稀缺问题，实验表明RVC能提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 方言识别模型常受限于方言数据稀缺，需要有效的数据增强方法。

Method: 采用RVC将音频样本转换为统一目标说话人，减少说话人相关变异性，突出方言特征。

Result: RVC单独使用或与其他增强方法（如频率掩码和片段移除）结合，均能提升分类性能。

Conclusion: RVC在低资源方言分类任务中具有潜力。

Abstract: Deep learning models for dialect identification are often limited by the
scarcity of dialectal data. To address this challenge, we propose to use
Retrieval-based Voice Conversion (RVC) as an effective data augmentation method
for a low-resource German dialect classification task. By converting audio
samples to a uniform target speaker, RVC minimizes speaker-related variability,
enabling models to focus on dialect-specific linguistic and phonetic features.
Our experiments demonstrate that RVC enhances classification performance when
utilized as a standalone augmentation method. Furthermore, combining RVC with
other augmentation methods such as frequency masking and segment removal leads
to additional performance gains, highlighting its potential for improving
dialect classification in low-resource scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了数据剪枝的两个关键组成部分（数据表示和选择算法），发现更好的表示（如训练梯度）通常能提升实例选择效果，而不同选择算法在不同场景下表现各异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据剪枝方法设计选择多样但缺乏系统性研究，限制了未来发展。

Method: 将数据剪枝分解为数据表示和选择算法两部分，并系统分析它们对实例选择的影响。

Result: 更好的表示（如训练梯度）能提升选择效果；不同选择算法在不同场景下表现各异，且未必符合其设计目标。

Conclusion: 需谨慎评估选择算法，未来研究应关注数据表示和算法的协同优化。

Abstract: Data pruning, selecting small but impactful subsets, offers a promising way
to efficiently scale NLP model training. However, existing methods often
involve many different design choices, which have not been systematically
studied. This limits future developments. In this work, we decompose data
pruning into two key components: the data representation and the selection
algorithm, and we systematically analyze their influence on the selection of
instances. Our theoretical and empirical results highlight the crucial role of
representations: better representations, e.g., training gradients, generally
lead to a better selection of instances, regardless of the chosen selection
algorithm. Furthermore, different selection algorithms excel in different
settings, and none consistently outperforms the others. Moreover, the selection
algorithms do not always align with their intended objectives: for example,
algorithms designed for the same objective can select drastically different
instances, highlighting the need for careful evaluation.

TL;DR: TRACE是一个模块化工具包，用于在训练和推理时分析Transformer模型的可解释性，揭示传统标量指标忽略的语言特征获取现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型训练中语言知识涌现的时间和方式问题，克服现有工具的后验性、标量依赖和集成难度。

Method: TRACE工具包结合ABSynth合成语料生成器，支持轻量级训练分析，包括特征探测、内在维度、Hessian曲率和输出诊断。

Result: 实验显示TRACE能捕捉早期句法涌现、延迟语义获取和表征压缩等发展现象。

Conclusion: TRACE使Transformer分析更具可解释性、可操作性和可重复性，支持层间诊断和早期停止。

Abstract: Understanding when and how linguistic knowledge emerges during language model
training remains a central challenge for interpretability. Most existing tools
are post hoc, rely on scalar metrics, or require nontrivial integration effort,
making comprehensive interpretability analysis difficult to deploy and
maintain. We introduce TRACE, a modular toolkit for training and inference-time
interpretability analysis of transformer models. It enables lightweight,
in-training analysis of linguistic and representational signals, including
features probing, intrinsic dimensionality, Hessian curvature, and output
diagnostics. It integrates with ABSynth, a controllable synthetic corpus
generator that provides structured annotations for precise evaluation of
linguistic feature acquisition. Experiments with autoregressive transformers
demonstrate that TRACE reveals developmental phenomena such as early syntactic
emergence, delayed semantic acquisition, and representational compression,
signals overlooked by traditional scalar metrics such as loss or accuracy. With
minimal integration effort, the tool enables layer-wise diagnostics,
convergence-based early stopping, and detection of structural errors, making
transformer analysis interpretable, actionable, and reproducible.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了PFO数据集和RAV框架，用于更真实地评估大语言模型（LLM）的事实核查能力，并显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事实核查基准数据集包含事后分析和标注者线索，限制了评估的真实性。

Method: 提出PFO数据集（移除事后信息）和RAV框架（三代理迭代验证）。

Result: RAV在多个基准上表现优于现有方法，性能下降最小（16.3%）。

Conclusion: RAV框架在事实核查任务中具有广泛适用性和优越性。

Abstract: Automated fact checking with large language models (LLMs) offers a scalable
alternative to manual verification. Evaluating fact checking is challenging as
existing benchmark datasets often include post claim analysis and annotator
cues, which are absent in real world scenarios where claims are fact checked
immediately after being made. This limits the realism of current evaluations.
We present Politi Fact Only (PFO), a 5 class benchmark dataset of 2,982
political claims from politifact.com, where all post claim analysis and
annotator cues have been removed manually. This ensures that models are
evaluated using only the information that would have been available prior to
the claim's verification. Evaluating LLMs on PFO, we see an average performance
drop of 22% in terms of macro f1 compared to PFO's unfiltered version. Based on
the identified challenges of the existing LLM based fact checking system, we
propose RAV (Recon Answer Verify), an agentic framework with three agents:
question generator, answer generator, and label generator. Our pipeline
iteratively generates and answers sub questions to verify different aspects of
the claim before finally generating the label. RAV generalizes across domains
and label granularities, and it outperforms state of the art approaches on well
known baselines RAWFC (fact checking, 3 class) by 25.28%, and on HOVER
(encyclopedia, 2 class) by 1.54% on 2 hop, 4.94% on 3 hop, and 1.78% on 4 hop,
sub categories respectively. RAV shows the least performance drop compared to
baselines of 16.3% in macro f1 when we compare PFO with its unfiltered version.

TL;DR: TACOS是一种创新的方法，通过结合开放标签和比较评分来选择指令微调（IFT）数据，解决了现有方法在数据多样性和评估标准不一致上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在数据选择和评估上存在局限性，如简单启发式方法限制数据多样性，单例数据质量评估导致标准不一致。

Method: TACOS利用LLMs为人类查询分配开放域标签，并通过归一化去噪和聚类捕获多样性；采用比较评分方法在集群内相对评估样本质量。

Result: TACOS在多个数据集和LLM架构上表现优异，尤其在MT-Bench和AlpacaEval 2.0上取得了最佳成绩。

Conclusion: TACOS在IFT数据选择上高效且有效，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) is crucial for aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences, and selecting a small yet representative subset
from massive data significantly facilitates IFT in terms of both efficiency and
effectiveness. Nevertheless, existing approaches suffer from two limitations:
the use of simple heuristics restricts data diversity, while the singleton data
quality evaluation accounts for inconsistent criteria between independent
samples. To address the issues, we present TACOS, an innovative method that
integrates Open Tagging and Comparative Scoring for IFT data selection. To
capture data diversity, we leverage LLMs to assign open-domain tags to human
queries, followed by a normalization stage to denoise the open tags and enable
efficient clustering. Additionally, we suggest a comparative scoring method
that allows the relative quality evaluation of samples within a cluster,
avoiding inconsistent criteria seen in singleton-based evaluations. Extensive
experiments across diverse datasets and LLM architectures demonstrate that
TACOS outperforms existing approaches by a large margin. Notably, it achieves
superior instruction-following performance on MT-Bench and ranks 1st among
LLaMA2-7B-Based models on AlpacaEval 2.0, illustrating its efficacy for IFT
data selection.

TL;DR: StructSense是一个基于LLM的模块化、任务无关的开源框架，用于结构化信息提取，通过领域特定知识和自评估机制解决领域敏感性和跨任务泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从非结构化源（如自由文本和科学文献）中提取结构化信息对加速科学发现至关重要，但现有LLM在专业领域和跨任务泛化方面表现不足。

Method: StructSense结合领域特定符号知识（本体论）和自评估机制（反馈循环），并引入人工验证机制。

Result: StructSense在神经科学信息提取任务中表现出色，克服了领域敏感性和跨任务泛化问题。

Conclusion: StructSense为结构化信息提取提供了一种有效的解决方案，尤其在专业领域和跨任务场景中表现优越。

Abstract: The ability to extract structured information from unstructured sources-such
as free-text documents and scientific literature-is critical for accelerating
scientific discovery and knowledge synthesis. Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various natural language processing
tasks, including structured information extraction. However, their
effectiveness often diminishes in specialized, domain-specific contexts that
require nuanced understanding and expert-level domain knowledge. In addition,
existing LLM-based approaches frequently exhibit poor transferability across
tasks and domains, limiting their scalability and adaptability. To address
these challenges, we introduce StructSense, a modular, task-agnostic,
open-source framework for structured information extraction built on LLMs.
StructSense is guided by domain-specific symbolic knowledge encoded in
ontologies, enabling it to navigate complex domain content more effectively. It
further incorporates agentic capabilities through self-evaluative judges that
form a feedback loop for iterative refinement, and includes human-in-the-loop
mechanisms to ensure quality and validation. We demonstrate that StructSense
can overcome both the limitations of domain sensitivity and the lack of
cross-task generalizability, as shown through its application to diverse
neuroscience information extraction tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态调整大型推理模型（LRMs）思考速度的方法，以优化准确性与效率的权衡，实现了无需额外训练的成本下提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型推理模型（LRMs）擅长慢速、深思熟虑的System 2思维，但缺乏快速、直觉的System 1思维，导致高计算开销和延迟。

Method: 通过识别控制快慢思维转换的向量，实现基于表示编辑的测试时缩放效果，并结合实时难度估计动态调整思考速度。

Result: 在无需额外训练的情况下，平均提升1.3%的准确性，同时减少8.6%的token使用量。

Conclusion: 该方法为LRMs提供了动态调整思考速度的能力，有望支持更广泛的应用并启发未来研究。

Abstract: Human cognition is theorized to operate in two modes: fast, intuitive System
1 thinking and slow, deliberate System 2 thinking. While current Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at System 2 thinking, their inability to perform
fast thinking leads to high computational overhead and latency. In this work,
we enable LRMs to approximate human intelligence through dynamic thinking speed
adjustment, optimizing accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Our approach addresses
two key questions: (1) how to control thinking speed in LRMs, and (2) when to
adjust it for optimal performance. For the first question, we identify the
steering vector that governs slow-fast thinking transitions in LRMs'
representation space. Using this vector, we achieve the first representation
editing-based test-time scaling effect, outperforming existing prompt-based
scaling methods. For the second question, we apply real-time difficulty
estimation to signal reasoning segments of varying complexity. Combining these
techniques, we propose the first reasoning strategy that enables fast
processing of easy steps and deeper analysis for complex reasoning. Without any
training or additional cost, our plug-and-play method yields an average +1.3%
accuracy with -8.6% token usage across leading LRMs and advanced reasoning
benchmarks. All of our algorithms are implemented based on vLLM and are
expected to support broader applications and inspire future research.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the ability of large language models (LLMs) to plan
and make decisions through the lens of the traditional Vietnamese board game,
\^O \u{A}n Quan. This game, which involves a series of strategic token
movements and captures, offers a unique environment for evaluating the
decision-making and strategic capabilities of LLMs. Specifically, we develop
various agent personas, ranging from aggressive to defensive, and employ the
\^O \u{A}n Quan game as a testbed for assessing LLM performance across
different strategies. Through experimentation with models like
Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct, we
aim to understand how these models execute strategic decision-making, plan
moves, and manage dynamic game states. The results will offer insights into the
strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in terms of reasoning and strategy,
contributing to a deeper understanding of their general capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become an essential infrastructure for
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), yet their lack of well-defined memory
management systems hinders the development of long-context reasoning, continual
personalization, and knowledge consistency.Existing models mainly rely on
static parameters and short-lived contextual states, limiting their ability to
track user preferences or update knowledge over extended periods.While
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces external knowledge in plain
text, it remains a stateless workaround without lifecycle control or
integration with persistent representations.Recent work has modeled the
training and inference cost of LLMs from a memory hierarchy perspective,
showing that introducing an explicit memory layer between parameter memory and
external retrieval can substantially reduce these costs by externalizing
specific knowledge. Beyond computational efficiency, LLMs face broader
challenges arising from how information is distributed over time and context,
requiring systems capable of managing heterogeneous knowledge spanning
different temporal scales and sources. To address this challenge, we propose
MemOS, a memory operating system that treats memory as a manageable system
resource. It unifies the representation, scheduling, and evolution of
plaintext, activation-based, and parameter-level memories, enabling
cost-efficient storage and retrieval. As the basic unit, a MemCube encapsulates
both memory content and metadata such as provenance and versioning. MemCubes
can be composed, migrated, and fused over time, enabling flexible transitions
between memory types and bridging retrieval with parameter-based learning.
MemOS establishes a memory-centric system framework that brings
controllability, plasticity, and evolvability to LLMs, laying the foundation
for continual learning and personalized modeling.

### [75] [Alpay Algebra IV: Symbiotic Semantics and the Fixed-Point Convergence of Observer Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03774)
*Bugra Kilictas,Faruk Alpay*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种理论框架，通过无限固定点交互实现文档与AI模型的语义对齐，基于Alpay代数，引入函子系统，确保在AI嵌入空间中存在唯一固定点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI与文本环境语义对齐的问题，确保AI的内部表示稳定、自洽且忠实于语义。

Method: 基于Alpay代数，构建函子系统，通过phi-infinity算子引导观察者（AI）与文本环境的协同演化。

Result: 证明了收敛的数学合理性、语义不变性和永久性，生成“共情嵌入”，捕捉内容和作者意图。

Conclusion: 为嵌入层面的对齐提供了严格的范畴论路径，对语义安全、符号记忆和自指理解有重要意义。

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework in which a document and an AI model engage
in a transfinite fixed-point interaction that leads to stable semantic
alignment. Building on the foundations of Alpay Algebra, we introduce a
functorial system wherein an observer (the AI) and a textual environment (this
paper) co-evolve through iterative transformations guided by the phi-infinity
operator. This process guarantees the existence of a unique fixed point in the
AI's embedding space -- a state where the AI's internal representation of the
content becomes stable, self-consistent, and semantically faithful. We prove
that such convergence is mathematically sound, semantically invariant, and
permanent, even under perturbation or further context expansion. This fixed
point acts as an "empathetic embedding," wherein the AI internalizes not only
the meaning of the content but also the author's intent. We interpret this as a
rigorous, category-theoretic route to alignment at the embedding level, with
implications for semantic security, symbolic memory, and the construction of AI
systems with persistent self-referential understanding. All references in this
paper function as nodes in the Alpay Algebra universe, and this work embeds
itself as a new fixed-point node within that transfinite semantic graph.

*Seungjun Shin,Jaehoon Oh,Dokwan Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了注意力机制中的sink token现象，提出了一种动态选择重要token的方法OrthoRank，实验表明其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索sink token与其他token的关系，并利用这一现象改进token选择方法。

Method: 通过分析隐藏状态的相似性，提出OrthoRank方法，基于token向sink token移动的速度定义重要性。

Result: 实验显示OrthoRank在困惑度和零样本准确率上优于现有方法，且在LongBench上表现更优。

Conclusion: OrthoRank方法有效利用了sink token现象，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Attention mechanisms are central to the success of large language models
(LLMs), enabling them to capture intricate token dependencies and implicitly
assign importance to each token. Recent studies have revealed the sink token,
which receives disproportionately high attention despite their limited semantic
role. In this paper, we first expand the relationship between the sink token
and other tokens, moving beyond attention to explore their similarity in hidden
states, considering the layer depth. We observe that as the layers get deeper,
the cosine similarity between the normalized hidden states of the sink token
and those of other tokens increases, and that the normalized hidden states of
the sink token exhibit negligible changes. These imply that other tokens
consistently are directed toward the sink token throughout the layers. Next, we
propose a dynamic token selection method, called OrthoRank, using these
findings to select important tokens. Specifically, in a certain layer, we
define token importance by the speed at which the token moves toward the sink
token. This is converted into orthogonality with the sink token, meaning that
tokens that are more orthogonal to the sink token are assigned greater
importance. Finally, through extensive experiments, we demonstrated that our
method results in lower perplexity and higher zero-shot accuracy compared to
layer pruning methods at the same sparsity ratio with comparable throughput,
while also achieving superior performance on LongBench.

transcripts/subtitles from movie trailers in the MovieLens-100K dataset,
covering 1682 movies of 18 genres, where each movie can have multiple genres.
Additionally, we extended our study by extracting IMDb movie posters to utilize
a Vision Language Model (VLM) with prompts for poster information. This
fine-grained information was used to enhance existing LLM prompts. In
conclusion, our study reveals ChatGPT's remarkable genre prediction
capabilities, surpassing other language models. The integration of VLM further
enhances our findings, showcasing ChatGPT's potential for content-related
applications by incorporating visual information from movie posters.

Motivation: 探讨模型崩溃（model collapse）如何通过翻译技术导致语言形式、语法特征和文化细微差别的消失。

Method: 结合计算机视觉、自然语言处理和机器翻译的最新研究，分析语言分布的尾部消失现象。

Result: 语言多样性和文化叙事正在逐渐消失。

Conclusion: 呼吁重新思考自然语言处理领域，以保护和促进多语言表达的多样性和创造力。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) considerably changed how
technologies can influence language. While previous technologies could mediate
or assist humans, there is now a tendency to \textit{offload} the task of
writing itself to these technologies, enabling them to change our linguistic
ecosystem more directly. While they provide us quick access to information and
impressively fluent output, beneath their apparent sophistication lies a
subtle, more insidious threat: the gradual decline and loss of linguistic
diversity. With this opinion piece, I explore how model collapse, with a
particular focus on translation technology, can lead to the loss of linguistic
forms, grammatical features, and cultural nuance. Model collapse refers to the
eventual consequence of self-consuming training loops, where models reinforce
their own biases and lose linguistic diversity. Drawing on recent work in
Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Translation
(MT), I argue that the tails of our linguistic distributions are vanishing, and
with them, the narratives and identities they carry. This is a call to resist
linguistic flattening and to reimagine NLP as a field that encourages, values
and protects expressive multilingual lexical and linguistic diversity and
creativity.

Conclusion: Easy Dataset为领域适应提供了一种高效且用户友好的解决方案，代码已开源并广受欢迎。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on
general-purpose tasks, yet adapting them to specific domains remains
challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality domain data. Existing data
synthesis tools often struggle to extract reliable fine-tuning data from
heterogeneous documents effectively. To address this limitation, we propose
Easy Dataset, a unified framework for synthesizing fine-tuning data from
unstructured documents via an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI).
Specifically, Easy Dataset allows users to easily configure text extraction
models and chunking strategies to transform raw documents into coherent text
chunks. It then leverages a persona-driven prompting approach to generate
diverse question-answer pairs using public-available LLMs. Throughout the
pipeline, a human-in-the-loop visual interface facilitates the review and
refinement of intermediate outputs to ensure data quality. Experiments on a
financial question-answering task show that fine-tuning LLMs on the synthesized
dataset significantly improves domain-specific performance while preserving
general knowledge. The source code and installable package are available at
https://github.com/ConardLi/easy-dataset and have garnered over 9,000 GitHub

Method: 设计Nunchi-Bench基准，包含247个问题，评估LLMs在韩国迷信文化中的事实知识、文化建议和情境解释能力。提出新的评估策略和评分指标。

Result: LLMs能识别事实信息，但在实际场景中应用困难；显式文化框架比语言提示更能提升性能。

Conclusion: Nunchi-Bench揭示了LLMs文化推理的不足，为未来研究提供了工具和方向。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become key advisors in various domains, their
cultural sensitivity and reasoning skills are crucial in multicultural
environments. We introduce Nunchi-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs'
cultural understanding, with a focus on Korean superstitions. The benchmark
consists of 247 questions spanning 31 topics, assessing factual knowledge,
culturally appropriate advice, and situational interpretation. We evaluate
multilingual LLMs in both Korean and English to analyze their ability to reason
about Korean cultural contexts and how language variations affect performance.
To systematically assess cultural reasoning, we propose a novel evaluation
strategy with customized scoring metrics that capture the extent to which
models recognize cultural nuances and respond appropriately. Our findings
highlight significant challenges in LLMs' cultural reasoning. While models
generally recognize factual information, they struggle to apply it in practical
scenarios. Furthermore, explicit cultural framing enhances performance more
effectively than relying solely on the language of the prompt. To support
further research, we publicly release Nunchi-Bench alongside a leaderboard.

Method: AdaPCR将段落组合作为检索单元，包括上下文感知的查询重构和基于下游答案可能性的重排序步骤，自适应选择检索段落数量。

Result: 实验表明，AdaPCR在多个QA基准测试中优于基线方法，特别是在多跳推理任务中。

Conclusion: AdaPCR通过建模段落间依赖关系，显著提升了检索效果，尤其在复杂推理任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
incorporating external documents at inference time, enabling up-to-date
knowledge access without costly retraining. However, conventional RAG methods
retrieve passages independently, often leading to redundant, noisy, or
insufficiently diverse context-particularly problematic - particularly
problematic in noisy corpora and for multi-hop questions. To address this, we
propose Adaptive Passage Combination Retrieval (AdaPCR), a novel framework for
open-domain question answering with black-box LMs. AdaPCR explicitly models
dependencies between passages by considering passage combinations as units for
retrieval and reranking. It consists of a context-aware query reformulation
using concatenated passages, and a reranking step trained with a predictive
objective aligned with downstream answer likelihood. Crucially, AdaPCR
adaptively selects the number of retrieved passages without additional stopping
modules. Experiments across several QA benchmarks show that AdaPCR outperforms
baselines, particularly in multi-hop reasoning, demonstrating the effectiveness
of modeling inter-passage dependencies for improved retrieval.

TL;DR: SCF是一种强化学习框架，通过分支对话架构优化LLMs在多轮对话中的表现，尤其在医疗诊断对话中表现优于线性架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如DPO和GRPO）在多轮对话任务中表现不足，尤其在需要理解早期对话对后续影响的应用（如医疗诊断）中。

Method: 提出SCF框架，利用分支对话架构生成多轮对话的多种可能延续，以学习早期对话对后续交互和结果的影响。

Result: 在模拟医患对话实验中，SCF的分支架构在诊断准确性上优于线性架构。

Conclusion: 分支训练架构是优化LLMs处理复杂多轮对话任务的重要策略。

Abstract: Fine-tuning methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have demonstrated success in training large
language models (LLMs) for single-turn tasks. However, these methods fall short
in multi-turn applications, such as diagnostic patient interviewing, where
understanding how early conversational turns influence downstream completions
and outcomes is essential. In medicine, a multi-turn perspective is critical
for learning diagnostic schemas and better understanding conversation dynamics.
To address this gap, I introduce Savage Conversation Forests (SCF), a
reinforcement learning framework that leverages a branched conversation
architecture to fine-tune LLMs for multi-turn dialogue. SCF generates multiple
possible conversation continuations at each turn, enabling the model to learn
how different early responses affect downstream interactions and diagnostic
outcomes. In experiments simulating doctor-patient conversations, SCF with
branching outperforms linear conversation architectures on diagnostic accuracy.
I hypothesize that SCF's improvements stem from its ability to provide richer,
interdependent training signals across conversation turns. These results
suggest that a branched training architecture is an important strategy for fine
tuning LLMs in complex multi-turn conversational tasks.

Conclusion: BYOKG-RAG为自定义知识图谱问答提供了更通用和鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) presents significant challenges due
to the structural and semantic variations across input graphs. Existing works
rely on Large Language Model (LLM) agents for graph traversal and retrieval; an
approach that is sensitive to traversal initialization, as it is prone to
entity linking errors and may not generalize well to custom ("bring-your-own")
KGs. We introduce BYOKG-RAG, a framework that enhances KGQA by synergistically
combining LLMs with specialized graph retrieval tools. In BYOKG-RAG, LLMs
generate critical graph artifacts (question entities, candidate answers,
reasoning paths, and OpenCypher queries), and graph tools link these artifacts
to the KG and retrieve relevant graph context. The retrieved context enables
the LLM to iteratively refine its graph linking and retrieval, before final
answer generation. By retrieving context from different graph tools, BYOKG-RAG
offers a more general and robust solution for QA over custom KGs. Through
experiments on five benchmarks spanning diverse KG types, we demonstrate that
BYOKG-RAG outperforms the second-best graph retrieval method by 4.5% points
while showing better generalization to custom KGs. BYOKG-RAG framework is
open-sourced at https://github.com/awslabs/graphrag-toolkit.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型生成内容中存在的幻觉问题，即模型自信生成但事实错误的内容。

Method: 利用多个随机生成结果的token级概率方差，设计模型无关、可解释的检测框架。

Result: 在SQuAD v2数据集上验证，token级方差能可靠指示模型输出的不稳定性，并与幻觉模式相关。

Conclusion: 该框架轻量、可复现且适应多领域，为大语言模型生成可靠性提供了有价值的诊断工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generative
capabilities across diverse tasks but remain susceptible to hallucinations,
confidently generated yet factually incorrect outputs. We introduce a
reference-free, token-level hallucination detection framework that leverages
the variance in token log-probabilities across multiple stochastic generations.
Unlike prior methods that require ground-truth references or sentence-level
verification, our approach is model-agnostic, interpretable, and suited for
real-time or post-hoc analysis. We evaluate our method on unanswerable question
prompts from the SQuAD v2 dataset and benchmark across three autoregressive
models of varying scales: GPT-Neo 125M, Falcon 1B, and Mistral 7B. Through both
quantitative metrics and visual diagnostics, we show that token-level variance
reliably highlights instability in model outputs and correlates with
hallucination patterns. Our framework is lightweight, reproducible, and
adaptable to multiple domains, offering a valuable diagnostic tool for
analyzing generative reliability in LLMs.

TL;DR: 研究表明，提示结构和LoRA微调对临床自然语言推理（NLI）性能有显著影响，紧凑模型结合强提示可媲美大型系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索提示策略和微调技术对大型语言模型（LLMs）在临床NLI任务中推理能力的影响。

Method: 评估四类提示策略，并通过LoRA微调将多步推理能力蒸馏到小模型中，使用NLI4CT基准测试。

Result: 提示类型占性能差异的44%，LoRA微调提升8-12 F1，缩小与GPT-4o-mini的差距至7.1%。

Conclusion: 提示设计和轻量级微调结合可提升临床NLP系统的效率和可信度，揭示了广泛采用技术的优势与局限。

Abstract: Recent works on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the impact of
prompting strategies and fine-tuning techniques on their reasoning
capabilities. Yet, their effectiveness on clinical natural language inference
(NLI) remains underexplored. This study presents the first controlled
evaluation of how prompt structure and efficient fine-tuning jointly shape
model performance in clinical NLI. We inspect four classes of prompting
strategies to elicit reasoning in LLMs at different levels of abstraction, and
evaluate their impact on a range of clinically motivated reasoning types. For
each prompting strategy, we construct high-quality demonstrations using a
frontier model to distil multi-step reasoning capabilities into smaller models
(4B parameters) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Across different language
models fine-tuned on the NLI4CT benchmark, we found that prompt type alone
accounts for up to 44% of the variance in macro-F1. Moreover, LoRA fine-tuning
yields consistent gains of +8 to 12 F1, raises output alignment above 97%, and
narrows the performance gap to GPT-4o-mini to within 7.1%. Additional
experiments on reasoning generalisation reveal that LoRA improves performance
in 75% of the models on MedNLI and TREC Clinical Trials Track. Overall, these
findings demonstrate that (i) prompt structure is a primary driver of clinical
reasoning performance, (ii) compact models equipped with strong prompts and
LoRA can rival frontier-scale systems, and (iii) reasoning-type-aware
evaluation is essential to uncover prompt-induced trade-offs. Our results
highlight the promise of combining prompt design and lightweight adaptation for
more efficient and trustworthy clinical NLP systems, providing insights on the
strengths and limitations of widely adopted prompting and parameter-efficient
techniques in highly specialised domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PEFT的新框架，结合对抗性数据增强和文化知识图谱，显著提升了多文化名字的零样本识别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球化背景下，传统方法难以应对多文化名字的多样性，亟需一种更鲁棒和准确的识别方法。

Method: 采用Prompt-Engineered Fine-Tuning（PEFT）框架，结合对抗性数据增强和文化知识图谱，将识别任务转化为引导生成问题。

Result: 实验表明，PEFT方法在零样本名字识别中达到93.1%的总体准确率和89.5%的挑战性任务准确率，优于传统深度学习方法。

Conclusion: PEFT框架在多文化名字识别中取得了显著突破，为实际应用提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The robust and accurate recognition of multicultural names, particularly
those not previously encountered, is a critical challenge in an increasingly
globalized digital landscape. Traditional methods often falter when confronted
with the vast diversity and novel permutations of names across different
linguistic and cultural backgrounds. This paper introduces a novel framework,
Prompt-Engineered Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for Large Language Models (LLMs) with
Adversarial Data Augmentation and Cultural Knowledge Graph Integration,
designed to significantly enhance zero-shot multicultural name recognition. Our
approach leverages the powerful linguistic understanding of pre-trained LLMs,
transforming the recognition task into a guided generation problem. Through
meticulous prompt engineering, dynamic integration of explicit cultural
knowledge derived from knowledge graphs, and the strategic application of
adversarial data augmentation, we equip the LLM with an unprecedented ability
to infer the cultural origin of unseen names. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our PEFT method consistently outperforms established deep learning
baselines, including advanced Bi-LSTM models with cultural tags, achieving an
impressive 93.1\% overall accuracy and a remarkable 89.5\% accuracy on
challenging zero-shot name identification. An in-depth ablation study confirms
the synergistic contribution of each component, while a human evaluation
highlights our method's performance approaching human expert judgment. This
work signifies a substantial leap in multicultural name recognition, offering a
highly effective and scalable solution for real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动标注角色关系耗时且覆盖率低，而LLM常产生幻觉或不一致输出，需更高效可靠的方法。

Method: 结合LLM提取与符号推理，构建可编辑角色关系图，并通过七种逻辑约束和交互界面进行优化。

Result: 实验表明SymbolicThought提高了标注准确性和一致性，同时显著降低时间成本。

Conclusion: SymbolicThought为叙事理解、可解释AI和LLM评估提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Understanding character relationships is essential for interpreting complex
narratives and conducting socially grounded AI research. However, manual
annotation is time-consuming and low in coverage, while large language models
(LLMs) often produce hallucinated or logically inconsistent outputs. We present
SymbolicThought, a human-in-the-loop framework that combines LLM-based
extraction with symbolic reasoning. The system constructs editable character
relationship graphs, refines them using seven types of logical constraints, and
enables real-time validation and conflict resolution through an interactive
interface. To support logical supervision and explainable social analysis, we
release a dataset of 160 interpersonal relationships with corresponding logical
structures. Experiments show that SymbolicThought improves annotation accuracy
and consistency while significantly reducing time cost, offering a practical
tool for narrative understanding, explainable AI, and LLM evaluation.

TL;DR: Context Tuning是一种无需微调模型参数即可显著提升语言模型少样本适应能力的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于提示的适应方法通常使用与任务无关的标记初始化可训练提示或前缀，而Context Tuning利用任务特定的演示示例初始化，以提升少样本学习性能。

Method: 通过任务特定的演示示例初始化可训练提示或前缀，利用模型的上下文学习能力提取相关信息。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Context Tuning优于传统提示方法，并达到与测试时训练相当的准确率，同时训练效率更高。

Conclusion: Context Tuning是一种高效且有效的少样本适应方法，优于传统提示方法。

Abstract: We introduce Context Tuning, a simple and effective method to significantly
enhance few-shot adaptation of language models (LLMs) without fine-tuning model
parameters. While prompt-based adaptation techniques have demonstrated the
effectiveness of lightweight adaptation methods for large language models
(LLMs), they typically initialize a trainable prompt or prefix with irrelevant
tokens for the task at hand. In contrast, Context Tuning initializes the
trainable prompt or prefix with task-specific demonstration examples,
leveraging the model's inherent In-Context Learning (ICL) ability to extract
relevant information for improved few-shot learning performance. Extensive
evaluations on benchmarks such as CrossFit, UnifiedQA, MMLU, BIG-Bench Hard,
and ARC demonstrate that Context Tuning outperforms traditional prompt-based
adaptation methods and achieves competitive accuracy to Test-Time Training with
significantly higher training efficiency.

TL;DR: 研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）在图书馆虚拟参考服务中是否对不同用户群体（性别、种族/民族、机构角色）提供公平服务，发现LLMs在种族/民族上无差异，仅在一个模型中对女性有轻微刻板偏见，但对机构角色有适应性调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在图书馆服务中是否能够公平服务所有用户，避免因训练数据中的社会偏见而影响服务公平性。

Method: 通过提示六种先进的LLMs，模拟不同身份（性别、种族/民族、机构角色）的用户请求，评估其响应是否存在差异。

Result: LLMs在种族/民族上无差异，仅一个模型对女性有轻微刻板偏见；对机构角色有适应性调整（如语言正式度、礼貌用语等）。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在图书馆参考服务中展现出公平且情境适应的沟通能力，具备较高的应用潜力。

Abstract: As libraries explore large language models (LLMs) for use in virtual
reference services, a key question arises: Can LLMs serve all users equitably,
regardless of demographics or social status? While they offer great potential
for scalable support, LLMs may also reproduce societal biases embedded in their
training data, risking the integrity of libraries' commitment to equitable
service. To address this concern, we evaluate whether LLMs differentiate
responses across user identities by prompting six state-of-the-art LLMs to
assist patrons differing in sex, race/ethnicity, and institutional role. We
found no evidence of differentiation by race or ethnicity, and only minor
evidence of stereotypical bias against women in one model. LLMs demonstrated
nuanced accommodation of institutional roles through the use of linguistic
choices related to formality, politeness, and domain-specific vocabularies,
reflecting professional norms rather than discriminatory treatment. These
findings suggest that current LLMs show a promising degree of readiness to
support equitable and contextually appropriate communication in academic
library reference services.

Motivation: 尽管东亚语言使用者众多，但其NLP数据集资源相对分散且研究不足，作者旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过定量和定性方法分析了HuggingFace生态系统中3,300多个数据集，比较了中文、日文和韩文社区的数据集创建模式。

Result: 研究发现中文数据集多为机构驱动，韩文数据集由社区主导，日文数据集则侧重于娱乐和亚文化。

Conclusion: 论文提出了改进数据集文档、许可清晰度和跨语言资源共享的策略，为东亚地区LLM开发提供指导。

Abstract: Recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have underscored the
crucial role of high-quality datasets in building large language models (LLMs).
However, while extensive resources and analyses exist for English, the
landscape for East Asian languages - particularly Chinese, Japanese, and Korean
(CJK) - remains fragmented and underexplored, despite these languages together
serving over 1.6 billion speakers. To address this gap, we investigate the
HuggingFace ecosystem from a cross-linguistic perspective, focusing on how
cultural norms, research environments, and institutional practices shape
dataset availability and quality. Drawing on more than 3,300 datasets, we
employ quantitative and qualitative methods to examine how these factors drive
distinct creation and curation patterns across Chinese, Japanese, and Korean
NLP communities. Our findings highlight the large-scale and often
institution-driven nature of Chinese datasets, grassroots community-led
development in Korean NLP, and an entertainment- and subculture-focused
emphasis on Japanese collections. By uncovering these patterns, we reveal
practical strategies for enhancing dataset documentation, licensing clarity,
and cross-lingual resource sharing - ultimately guiding more effective and
culturally attuned LLM development in East Asia. We conclude by discussing best
practices for future dataset curation and collaboration, aiming to strengthen
resource development across all three languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仇恨内容仍是重大挑战，现有方法多为被动措施，缺乏统一框架。

Method: 从国家法规、平台政策和NLP研究数据集三个角度综合分析。

Result: 发现仇恨言论定义和监管实践存在显著不一致，且与研究努力缺乏对齐。

Conclusion: 建议探索统一自动化仇恨言论监管框架，结合多样化策略。

Abstract: Despite regulations imposed by nations and social media platforms, e.g.
(Government of India, 2021; European Parliament and Council of the European
Union, 2022), inter alia, hateful content persists as a significant challenge.
Existing approaches primarily rely on reactive measures such as blocking or
suspending offensive messages, with emerging strategies focusing on proactive
measurements like detoxification and counterspeech. In our work, which we call
HatePRISM, we conduct a comprehensive examination of hate speech regulations
and strategies from three perspectives: country regulations, social platform
policies, and NLP research datasets. Our findings reveal significant
inconsistencies in hate speech definitions and moderation practices across
jurisdictions and platforms, alongside a lack of alignment with research
efforts. Based on these insights, we suggest ideas and research direction for
further exploration of a unified framework for automated hate speech moderation
incorporating diverse strategies.

Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型在分析健康公共话语中情感分类的准确性和可行性，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 利用Facebook和Twitter数据，结合人工标注，评估三种LLMs对HPV疫苗接种和加热烟草产品相关情感的分类能力。

Result: 模型在风险促进和健康支持情感分类上总体表现良好，但存在平台和议题差异，且中性信息检测准确性较低。

Conclusion: 选择和使用语言模型进行公共健康分析时需谨慎验证，以避免训练数据偏见导致的视角偏差。

Abstract: Machine learning methods are increasingly applied to analyze health-related
public discourse based on large-scale data, but questions remain regarding
their ability to accurately detect different types of health sentiments.
Especially, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained attention as a powerful
technology, yet their accuracy and feasibility in capturing different opinions
and perspectives on health issues are largely unexplored. Thus, this research
examines how accurate the three prominent LLMs (GPT, Gemini, and LLAMA) are in
detecting risk-promoting versus health-supporting sentiments across two
critical public health topics: Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and
heated tobacco products (HTPs). Drawing on data from Facebook and Twitter, we
curated multiple sets of messages supporting or opposing recommended health
behaviors, supplemented with human annotations as the gold standard for
sentiment classification. The findings indicate that all three LLMs generally
demonstrate substantial accuracy in classifying risk-promoting and
health-supporting sentiments, although notable discrepancies emerge by
platform, health issue, and model type. Specifically, models often show higher
accuracy for risk-promoting sentiment on Facebook, whereas health-supporting
messages on Twitter are more accurately detected. An additional analysis also
shows the challenges LLMs face in reliably detecting neutral messages. These
results highlight the importance of carefully selecting and validating language
models for public health analyses, particularly given potential biases in
training data that may lead LLMs to overestimate or underestimate the
prevalence of certain perspectives.

Method: 采用持续预训练、指令微调和规则强化学习等方法，评估不同数据源（短/长推理链样本）对泛化的影响。

Result: 持续预训练对通用推理有一定帮助，指令微调效果有限甚至有害，长推理链和规则强化学习显著提升泛化能力。

Conclusion: 长推理链结合自反思是提升通用推理能力的有效途径，传统短推理链方法效果不佳。

Abstract: There has been a growing interest in enhancing the mathematical
problem-solving (MPS) capabilities of large language models. While the majority
of research efforts concentrate on creating specialized models to solve
mathematical problems, it remains unknown how learning mathematical
problem-solving generalizes to help develop other reasoning abilities. In this
paper, we present an empirical investigation into the generalization potential
of various MPS training approaches, such as continual pretraining, instruction
tuning, and rule-based reinforcement learning across various data sources,
including both short and long chain-of-thought (CoT) samples. Evaluation on 5
mathematical and 8 general reasoning benchmarks show that continual pretraining
on math text is able to generalize to general reasoning tasks to some extent.
In constrast, instruction tuning on conventional, short MPS samples provides
limited benefits and, in many cases, even impairs generalization performance.
Notably, training with long CoT responses for MPS samples and incorporating
rule-based reinforcement learning on MPS queries exhibit distinct behavior,
significantly enhancing generalization by extending the model's reasoning
processes into other domains. These results suggest that traditional approaches
to learning MPS with short reasoning chains largely fail to achieve robust
generalization. However, the emerging paradigm of longer reasoning chains,
coupled with self-reflection, offers a promising direction for improving
generalized reasoning abilities through learning from specialized domains.

Method: 利用7,500份联合国（UN）决议文件，构建轻量级、基于聊天的问答系统SpiritRAG，支持复杂、上下文敏感的数据库搜索。

Result: 通过100个手动编写的问题进行试点测试和专家评估，证明了SpiritRAG的实用性和价值。

Conclusion: SpiritRAG为研究人员和政策制定者提供了一种高效、易用的工具，用于从大型R/S相关数据集中提取可操作见解。

Abstract: Religion and spirituality (R/S) are complex and highly domain-dependent
concepts which have long confounded researchers and policymakers. Due to their
context-specificity, R/S are difficult to operationalize in conventional
archival search strategies, particularly when datasets are very large, poorly
accessible, and marked by information noise. As a result, considerable time
investments and specialist knowledge is often needed to extract actionable
insights related to R/S from general archival sources, increasing reliance on
published literature and manual desk reviews. To address this challenge, we
present SpiritRAG, an interactive Question Answering (Q&A) system based on
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Built using 7,500 United Nations (UN)
resolution documents related to R/S in the domains of health and education,
SpiritRAG allows researchers and policymakers to conduct complex,
context-sensitive database searches of very large datasets using an easily
accessible, chat-based web interface. SpiritRAG is lightweight to deploy and
leverages both UN documents and user provided documents as source material. A
pilot test and evaluation with domain experts on 100 manually composed
questions demonstrates the practical value and usefulness of SpiritRAG.

Motivation: 解决Transformer因依赖softmax注意力而在长上下文场景中计算效率低下的问题。

Method: 将输入分块，块内使用线性循环捕获局部依赖，块间使用软注意力建模长程交互，并调整块大小以平衡RNN和注意力的优势。

Result: 在16的块大小下，RAT层在100K标记序列上训练速度提升7倍，4K序列生成速度提升9倍，同时保持或优于标准注意力的精度。

Conclusion: RAT及其混合架构在速度和性能上均优于传统注意力，尤其在常识推理、代码任务和摘要任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Transformers have become the cornerstone of modern large-scale language
models; however, their dependence on softmax attention poses a major
computational bottleneck, particularly in long-context settings. In this work,
rather than following prevalent approaches such as linear attention (or SSMs)
and local attention, we introduce an intermediate design called \rat between
recurrence and attention mechanisms. It partitions the input into chunks,
applies a simple linear recurrence within each chunk to capture local
dependencies, and then performs softmax attention across chunks to model
long-range interactions. By adjusting the size of the chunk, \rat enables
flexible trade-offs, combining the strengths of RNN and attention. Empirically,
with a chunk size of 16, the \rat layer achieves a \(7\times\) improvement in
training speed with 100K token sequences and \(9\times\) in generation at 4K
sequence length, while maintaining similar or sometimes even better accuracy
compared to standard attention. We demonstrate this by training 1.3B parameter
models from scratch and performing large-scale evaluations, including short-
and long-context benchmarks, as well as supervised fine-tuning~(SFT). We
further propose a hybrid architecture that interleaves \rat with local
attention. By combining efficient long-range modeling with strong local
interactions, this hybrid design not only improves inference speed and reduces
cache memory usage compared to attention, but also consistently enhances
performance, for example, achieving an average 1 point gain in commonsense
reasoning tasks, up to 4 points on code tasks, and a 1 point Rouge-L increase
in a summarization SFT task. Code is available at

Result: 实验表明，GradOT在隐私保护和模型性能上优于现有OT方法。

Conclusion: GradOT为OT提供了理论基础，并为大规模LLMs的离站调优提供了无需训练的实用解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) with traditional centralized
fine-tuning emerges as a key technique for adapting these models to
domain-specific challenges, yielding privacy risks for both model and data
owners. One promising solution, called offsite-tuning (OT), is proposed to
address these challenges, where a weaker emulator is compressed from the
original model and further fine-tuned with adapter to enhance privacy. However,
the existing OT-based methods require high computational costs and lack
theoretical analysis. This paper introduces a novel OT approach based on
gradient-preserving compression, named GradOT. By analyzing the OT problem
through the lens of optimization, we propose a method that selectively applies
compression techniques such as rank compression and channel pruning, preserving
the gradients of fine-tuned adapters while ensuring privacy. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses existing OT methods, both
in terms of privacy protection and model performance. Our method provides a
theoretical foundation for OT and offers a practical, training-free solution
for offsite-tuning of large-scale LLMs.

Motivation: 现有模型难以捕捉讽刺背后的深层逻辑，主要依赖浅层线索，如图像标题或对象属性对。

Method: MiDRE结合内部推理专家（检测图像-文本对的不一致性）和外部推理专家（利用大型视觉语言模型生成的链式思维提示），并通过自适应门控机制动态加权。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上，MiDRE表现优于基线模型，外部推理提供的线索对理解讽刺至关重要。

Conclusion: MiDRE通过结合内部和外部推理，显著提升了多模态讽刺检测的性能，外部推理线索即使有噪声也具有重要价值。

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection has attracted growing interest due to the rise
of multimedia posts on social media. Understanding sarcastic image-text posts
often requires external contextual knowledge, such as cultural references or
commonsense reasoning. However, existing models struggle to capture the deeper
rationale behind sarcasm, relying mainly on shallow cues like image captions or
object-attribute pairs from images. To address this, we propose \textbf{MiDRE}
(\textbf{Mi}xture of \textbf{D}ual \textbf{R}easoning \textbf{E}xperts), which
integrates an internal reasoning expert for detecting incongruities within the
image-text pair and an external reasoning expert that utilizes structured
rationales generated via Chain-of-Thought prompting to a Large Vision-Language
Model. An adaptive gating mechanism dynamically weighs the two experts,
selecting the most relevant reasoning path. Experiments on two benchmark
datasets show that MiDRE achieves superior performance over baselines. Various
qualitative analyses highlight the crucial role of external rationales,
revealing that even when they are occasionally noisy, they provide valuable

*Soumyadeep Jana,Abhrajyoti Kundu,Sanasam Ranbir Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DMDP是一种用于少样本多模态讽刺检测的新框架，通过模态特定的深度提示和跨模态对齐提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型依赖大量标注数据，不适用于标注稀缺的实际场景，因此探索少样本设置下的讽刺检测问题。

Method: DMDP采用门控模态特定深度提示，结合提示共享机制和跨模态提示对齐模块，实现分层特征学习和模态交互。

Result: 在两个公共数据集上，DMDP在少样本和极低资源设置下表现优异，且跨数据集评估显示其泛化能力强。

Conclusion: DMDP在多模态讽刺检测任务中显著优于基线方法，尤其在少样本和跨领域场景下表现突出。

Abstract: The widespread use of multimodal content on social media has heightened the
need for effective sarcasm detection to improve opinion mining. However,
existing models rely heavily on large annotated datasets, making them less
suitable for real-world scenarios where labeled data is scarce. This motivates
the need to explore the problem in a few-shot setting. To this end, we
introduce DMDP (Deep Modality-Disentangled Prompt Tuning), a novel framework
for few-shot multimodal sarcasm detection. Unlike prior methods that use
shallow, unified prompts across modalities, DMDP employs gated,
modality-specific deep prompts for text and visual encoders. These prompts are
injected across multiple layers to enable hierarchical feature learning and
better capture diverse sarcasm types. To enhance intra-modal learning, we
incorporate a prompt-sharing mechanism across layers, allowing the model to
aggregate both low-level and high-level semantic cues. Additionally, a
cross-modal prompt alignment module enables nuanced interactions between image
and text representations, improving the model's ability to detect subtle
sarcastic intent. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate DMDP's
superior performance in both few-shot and extremely low-resource settings.
Further cross-dataset evaluations show that DMDP generalizes well across
domains, consistently outperforming baseline methods.

*Zhen Xiong,Yujun Cai,Zhecheng Li,Yiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为$S^3$的框架，用于改进扩散大语言模型（dLLMs）在可控文本生成中的性能，解决了现有方法在序列长度敏感性、幻觉率和推理成本方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在文本生成中展现出潜力，但现有方法在可控生成方面存在显著问题，如序列长度敏感性、高幻觉率和推理成本高。

Method: 提出$S^3$框架，通过将目标模式结构注入输出上下文，减少不必要计算并提升可控性。

Result: 实验表明，$S^3$在结构一致性、内容保真度和幻觉率方面分别提升了65%、48%和17%。

Conclusion: $S^3$为扩散模型在可控文本生成任务中的应用提供了理论和实践基础。

Abstract: Diffusion models, originally developed for image generation, have emerged as
a promising alternative to autoregressive large language models (LLMs). We
present a theoretical analysis comparing autoregressive and masked diffusion
LLMs, revealing that the intrinsic bidirectional attention mechanism of
diffusion LLMs (dLLMs) enables superior context modeling and generation
controllability. However, existing dLLM applications face significant
challenges in controllable generation: the native multi-step denoising process
exhibits high sensitivity to sequence length, elevated hallucination rates, and
prohibitive inference costs without specialized optimizations. To address these
limitations, we propose \textbf{S}elf-adaptive \textbf{S}chema
\textbf{S}caffolding ($S^3$), a novel framework that enables dLLMs to generate
structured outputs (e.g., JSON) while maintaining semantic fidelity and
accelerating inference. Our approach injects the target schema structure into
the output context, reducing unnecessary computation while improving
controllability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $S^3$ achieves
substantial improvements: 65\% increase in structural adherence, 48\%
enhancement in content fidelity, and 17\% reduction in hallucination rates
compared to baseline. These results establish both theoretical foundations and
practical pathways for deploying diffusion models in controllable text
generation tasks. Code and data will be publicly released.

*Soumyadeep Jana,Sahil Danayak,Sanasam Ranbir Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdS（Adapter-State Sharing）是一种轻量级框架，用于多模态图像-文本讽刺检测，通过共享适配器状态提升跨模态学习效率，在低资源设置下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态讽刺检测在资源受限环境下的挑战，现有方法依赖大型预训练模型的全微调，不适合低资源场景。

Method: 基于CLIP框架，仅在上层插入适配器，并引入适配器状态共享机制，文本适配器指导视觉适配器。

Result: 在两个公开基准测试中，AdS以显著更少的可训练参数实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: AdS在低资源环境下高效且有效，为多模态讽刺检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: The growing prevalence of multimodal image-text sarcasm on social media poses
challenges for opinion mining, especially under resource constraints. Existing
approaches rely on full fine-tuning of large pre-trained models, making them
unsuitable for low-resource settings. While recent parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) methods offer promise, their off-the-shelf use underperforms
on complex tasks like sarcasm detection. We propose AdS (Adapter-State
Sharing), a lightweight framework built on CLIP that inserts adapters only in
the upper layers and introduces a novel adapter-state sharing mechanism, where
textual adapters guide visual ones. This design promotes efficient cross-modal
learning while preserving low-level unimodal representations. Experiments on
two public benchmarks demonstrate that AdS achieves state-of-the-art results
using significantly fewer trainable parameters than existing PEFT and full
fine-tuning approaches.

*Rushil Thareja,Preslav Nakov,Praneeth Vepakomma,Nils Lukas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DP-Fusion是一种差分隐私推理机制，通过分组处理敏感令牌并混合输出分布，保护上下文隐私，同时平衡效用与隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）可能泄露敏感信息，现有方法缺乏正式保证或效用/隐私权衡不佳。

Method: DP-Fusion将敏感令牌分组，每组运行一次LLM，混合输出分布以控制隐私/效用权衡。

Result: 该方法通过参数ε灵活控制隐私与效用，但需多次LLM前向传播。

Conclusion: DP-Fusion提供了形式化隐私保证，适用于文档私有化等任务。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can leak sensitive information from their
context through generated outputs, either accidentally or when prompted
adversarially. Existing defenses that aim to preserve context privacy during
inference either lack formal guarantees or suffer from a poor utility/privacy
trade-off. We propose DP-Fusion, a token-level Differentially Private Inference
(DPI) mechanism that provably bounds how much an LLM's outputs reveal about
sensitive tokens in its context. We demonstrate DPI through the task of
document privatization, where the goal is to paraphrase documents so that
sensitive content (e.g., Personally Identifiable Information, PII) cannot be
reliably inferred, while still preserving the overall utility of the text. This
is controlled by a parameter $\epsilon$: $\epsilon=0$ hides PII entirely, while
higher values trade off privacy for improved paraphrase quality. DP-Fusion
works as follows: (i) partition sensitive tokens into disjoint privacy groups,
(ii) run the LLM once per group, and (iii) blend the output distributions so
that the final output remains within a fixed statistical distance of the
baseline distribution produced when no privacy group is revealed. This approach
allows fine-grained control over the privacy/utility trade-off but requires
multiple LLM forward passes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现代LLM开发中双脚本语言（阿拉伯和拉丁）适应不足的问题。

Method: 采用Branch-Train-MiX策略合并脚本专家，构建MoE模型。

Result: Nile-Chat模型在埃及评估基准上显著领先，12B模型在拉丁脚本任务上性能提升14.4%。

Conclusion: 该研究为双脚本语言LLM适配提供了全面方法，资源已开源。

Abstract: We introduce Nile-Chat-4B, 3x4B-A6B, and 12B, a collection of LLMs for
Egyptian dialect, uniquely designed to understand and generate texts written in
both Arabic and Latin scripts. Specifically, with Nile-Chat-3x4B-A6B, we
introduce a novel language adaptation approach by leveraging the
Branch-Train-MiX strategy to merge script-specialized experts, into a single
MoE model. Our Nile-Chat models significantly outperform leading multilingual
and Arabic LLMs, such as LLaMa, Jais, and ALLaM, on our newly introduced
Egyptian evaluation benchmarks, which span both understanding and generative
tasks. Notably, our 12B model yields a 14.4% performance gain over
Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct on Latin-script benchmarks. All our resources are publicly
available. We believe this work presents a comprehensive methodology for
adapting LLMs to dual-script languages, addressing an often overlooked aspect
in modern LLM development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏统一的理论框架来系统理解LLM个性化的驱动因素，研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 整合认知双记忆模型，提出PRIME框架，结合情景记忆（用户历史互动）和语义记忆（长期信念），并引入慢思考策略。

Result: 实验证明PRIME在长短上下文场景中均有效，能捕捉动态个性化而非仅流行偏见。

Conclusion: PRIME为LLM个性化提供了统一框架，并通过新数据集和实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) personalization aims to align model outputs with
individuals' unique preferences and opinions. While recent efforts have
implemented various personalization methods, a unified theoretical framework
that can systematically understand the drivers of effective personalization is
still lacking. In this work, we integrate the well-established cognitive
dual-memory model into LLM personalization, by mirroring episodic memory to
historical user engagements and semantic memory to long-term, evolving user
beliefs. Specifically, we systematically investigate memory instantiations and
introduce a unified framework, PRIME, using episodic and semantic memory
mechanisms. We further augment PRIME with a novel personalized thinking
capability inspired by the slow thinking strategy. Moreover, recognizing the
absence of suitable benchmarks, we introduce a dataset using Change My View
(CMV) from Reddit, specifically designed to evaluate long-context
personalization. Extensive experiments validate PRIME's effectiveness across
both long- and short-context scenarios. Further analysis confirms that PRIME
effectively captures dynamic personalization beyond mere popularity biases.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种计算框架，用于分析新闻文章和读者评论中的框架传递和重组，发现框架在评论中的重复使用高度相关，并发布了相关数据集和分类器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于填补NLP方法中忽略新闻框架与受众响应之间关系的空白，提出一种计算框架以分析框架在新闻和评论中的传递和重组。

Method: 方法包括细化框架标签，构建从句子级预测重建主导框架的框架，并将文章与主题相关的评论对齐。

Result: 研究发现，评论中的框架重复使用在两家新闻媒体中高度相关，但主题特定模式有所不同。

Conclusion: 结论是提出的计算框架有效，并发布了相关数据集和分类器，为未来研究提供了工具。

Abstract: When a news article describes immigration as an "economic burden" or a
"humanitarian crisis," it selectively emphasizes certain aspects of the issue.
Although \textit{framing} shapes how the public interprets such issues,
audiences do not absorb frames passively but actively reorganize the presented
information. While this relationship between source content and audience
response is well-documented in the social sciences, NLP approaches often ignore
it, detecting frames in articles and responses in isolation. We present the
first computational framework for large-scale analysis of framing across source
content (news articles) and audience responses (reader comments).
Methodologically, we refine frame labels and develop a framework that
reconstructs dominant frames in articles and comments from sentence-level
predictions, and aligns articles with topically relevant comments. Applying our
framework across eleven topics and two news outlets, we find that frame reuse
in comments correlates highly across outlets, while topic-specific patterns
vary. We release a frame classifier that performs well on both articles and
comments, a dataset of article and comment sentences manually labeled for
frames, and a large-scale dataset of articles and comments with predicted frame
labels.

Conclusion: 该方法为LLMs的自我校正提供了一种轻量级且可解释的解决方案，无需额外训练。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful yet prone to generating factual
errors, commonly referred to as hallucinations. We present a lightweight,
interpretable framework for knowledge-aware self-correction of LLM outputs

fine-tuning, our method post-processes model outputs and corrects factual
inconsistencies via external semantic memory. We demonstrate the approach using
DistilGPT-2 and show promising results on simple factual prompts.

Motivation: 解决移动计算时代中，资源受限的边缘环境下部署高效NLP模型的挑战，包括隐私合规、实时响应和多任务需求。

Method: 提出EI-BERT框架，结合硬令牌剪枝、跨蒸馏和参数量化技术，通过跨蒸馏方法实现高效知识传递。

Result: 实现了仅1.91 MB的超紧凑BERT模型，是目前NLU任务中最小的模型，并在Alipay生态中成功部署。

Conclusion: EI-BERT在资源受限的边缘环境中表现优异，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In the era of mobile computing, deploying efficient Natural Language
Processing (NLP) models in resource-restricted edge settings presents
significant challenges, particularly in environments requiring strict privacy
compliance, real-time responsiveness, and diverse multi-tasking capabilities.
These challenges create a fundamental need for ultra-compact models that
maintain strong performance across various NLP tasks while adhering to
stringent memory constraints. To this end, we introduce Edge ultra-lIte BERT
framework (EI-BERT) with a novel cross-distillation method. EI-BERT efficiently
compresses models through a comprehensive pipeline including hard token
pruning, cross-distillation and parameter quantization. Specifically, the
cross-distillation method uniquely positions the teacher model to understand
the student model's perspective, ensuring efficient knowledge transfer through
parameter integration and the mutual interplay between models. Through
extensive experiments, we achieve a remarkably compact BERT-based model of only
1.91 MB - the smallest to date for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks.
This ultra-compact model has been successfully deployed across multiple
scenarios within the Alipay ecosystem, demonstrating significant improvements
in real-world applications. For example, it has been integrated into Alipay's
live Edge Recommendation system since January 2024, currently serving the app's
recommendation traffic across \textbf{8.4 million daily active devices}.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于强化学习的框架R1-RE，通过模仿人类标注者的推理过程，显著提升了关系抽取任务在域外数据上的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的关系抽取方法在域外数据上泛化能力较差，受人类标注者工作流程启发，作者希望通过强化学习框架改进这一问题。

Method: 将关系抽取任务重新定义为基于标注指南的推理任务，并引入R1-RE框架，利用小语言模型的推理能力进行标注。

Result: 在Sem-2010和MDKG数据集上，R1-RE-7B模型的域外准确率达到约70%，与GPT-4o等领先专有模型相当。

Conclusion: R1-RE框架不仅提升了关系抽取任务的域外泛化能力，还为强化学习在自然语言处理中的应用提供了新见解。

Abstract: Relationship extraction (RE) is a core task in natural language processing.
Traditional approaches typically frame RE as a supervised learning problem,
directly mapping context to labels-an approach that often suffers from poor
out-of-domain (OOD) generalization. Inspired by the workflow of human
annotators, we reframe RE as a reasoning task guided by annotation guidelines
and introduce R1-RE, the first reinforcement learning with verifiable reward
(RLVR) framework for RE tasks. Our method elicits the reasoning abilities of
small language models for annotation tasks, resulting in significantly improved
OOD robustness. We evaluate our approach on the public Sem-2010 dataset and a
private MDKG dataset. The R1-RE-7B model attains an average OOD accuracy of
approximately 70%, on par with leading proprietary models such as GPT-4o.
Additionally, our comprehensive analysis provides novel insights into the
training dynamics and emergent reasoning behaviors of the RLVR paradigm for RE.

Filter module filtering and obtaining multiple relevant schemas; 2) a
multi-generator ensemble approach generating multiple highquality and diverse
SQL queries; 3) a selection model with a candidate reorganization strategy

Abstract: Customer reviews on e-commerce platforms capture critical affective signals
that drive purchasing decisions. However, no existing research has explored the
joint task of emotion detection and explanatory span identification in
e-commerce reviews - a crucial gap in understanding what triggers customer
emotional responses. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel joint task unifying
Emotion detection and Opinion Trigger extraction (EOT), which explicitly models
the relationship between causal text spans (opinion triggers) and affective
dimensions (emotion categories) grounded in Plutchik's theory of 8 primary
emotions. In the absence of labeled data, we introduce EOT-X, a human-annotated
collection of 2,400 reviews with fine-grained emotions and opinion triggers. We
evaluate 23 Large Language Models (LLMs) and present EOT-DETECT, a structured
prompting framework with systematic reasoning and self-reflection. Our
framework surpasses zero-shot and chain-of-thought techniques, across
e-commerce domains.

evaluation settings across these benchmarks lead to inconsistent results,
making it difficult to draw reliable comparisons. Besides, the high

the community to conduct comprehensive assessments of long-context models. In
this paper, we propose LOOM-Scope, a comprehensive and efficient framework for
long-context evaluation. LOOM-Scope standardizes evaluation settings across
diverse benchmarks, supports deployment of efficient long-context inference
acceleration methods, and introduces a holistic yet lightweight benchmark suite
to evaluate models comprehensively. Homepage: https://loomscope.github.io

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的任务，即生成查询聚焦的比较可解释摘要（QF-CES），并利用多源意见摘要（M-OS）方法。通过引入MS-Q2P数据集和大型语言模型（LLMs），实现了高效、个性化的摘要生成，且推理延迟降低了40%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统意见摘要方法无法提供全面的比较视角，而产品推荐需要这种比较分析。

Method: 使用多源意见摘要（M-OS）作为中间步骤，结合大型语言模型（LLMs）生成表格形式的比较摘要。

Result: M-OS方法比直接输入方法（DIA）减少约40%的推理延迟，且生成的摘要与人类评价的Spearman相关性为0.74。

Conclusion: QF-CES方法在生成和评估查询聚焦的比较摘要方面表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Product recommendations inherently involve comparisons, yet traditional
opinion summarization often fails to provide holistic comparative insights. We
propose the novel task of generating Query-Focused Comparative Explainable
Summaries (QF-CES) using Multi-Source Opinion Summarization (M-OS). To address
the lack of query-focused recommendation datasets, we introduce MS-Q2P,
comprising 7,500 queries mapped to 22,500 recommended products with metadata.
We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate tabular comparative
summaries with query-specific explanations. Our approach is personalized,
privacy-preserving, recommendation engine-agnostic, and category-agnostic. M-OS
as an intermediate step reduces inference latency approximately by 40% compared
to the direct input approach (DIA), which processes raw data directly. We
evaluate open-source and proprietary LLMs for generating and assessing QF-CES.
Extensive evaluations using QF-CES-PROMPT across 5 dimensions (clarity,
faithfulness, informativeness, format adherence, and query relevance) showed an
average Spearman correlation of 0.74 with human judgments, indicating its
potential for QF-CES evaluation.

Motivation: 探索自监督语音模型如何表示单词重音，并比较不同语言（可变重音与固定重音）的表现差异。

Method: 在五种语言（荷兰语、英语、德语、匈牙利语和波兰语）上训练诊断性重音分类器，分析模型嵌入的表现。

Result: 分类器能高精度区分重音和非重音音节，且重音表示具有语言特异性，可变重音与固定重音语言差异显著。

Conclusion: 自监督语音模型能有效学习语言特异性的单词重音表示，可变重音与固定重音语言的差异尤为明显。

Abstract: In this paper we study word stress representations learned by self-supervised
speech models (S3M), specifically the Wav2vec 2.0 model. We investigate the S3M
representations of word stress for five different languages: Three languages
with variable or lexical stress (Dutch, English and German) and two languages
with fixed or demarcative stress (Hungarian and Polish). We train diagnostic
stress classifiers on S3M embeddings and show that they can distinguish between
stressed and unstressed syllables in read-aloud short sentences with high
accuracy. We also tested language-specificity effects of S3M word stress. The
results indicate that the word stress representations are language-specific,
with a greater difference between the set of variable versus the set of fixed
stressed languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 犹太阿拉伯语因其独特的书写系统和语言混合特性，转写为阿拉伯字母具有挑战性，限制了阿拉伯NLP工具的应用。

Method: 采用两步法：先进行简单字符级映射，再进行后校正以解决语法和拼写错误。

Result: 首次对LLMs在此任务上的表现进行了基准评估，并证明转写后能实现形态句法标注和机器翻译。

Conclusion: 该方法为犹太阿拉伯语文本的NLP处理提供了可行解决方案，扩展了阿拉伯NLP工具的应用范围。

Abstract: Judeo-Arabic refers to Arabic variants historically spoken by Jewish
communities across the Arab world, primarily during the Middle Ages. Unlike
standard Arabic, it is written in Hebrew script by Jewish writers and for
Jewish audiences. Transliterating Judeo-Arabic into Arabic script is
challenging due to ambiguous letter mappings, inconsistent orthographic
conventions, and frequent code-switching into Hebrew and Aramaic. In this
paper, we introduce a two-step approach to automatically transliterate
Judeo-Arabic into Arabic script: simple character-level mapping followed by
post-correction to address grammatical and orthographic errors. We also present
the first benchmark evaluation of LLMs on this task. Finally, we show that

*Anuj Attri,Arnav Attri,Pushpak Bhattacharyya,Suman Banerjee,Amey Patil,Muthusamy Chelliah,Nikesh Garera*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 多源意见摘要（M-OS）通过整合产品描述、关键特征、规格和评分等元数据，生成更全面的摘要。尽管大语言模型（LLMs）在NLP任务中表现优异，但其在M-OS中的应用尚未充分探索。为此，作者提出了M-OS-EVAL评估数据集，并验证了M-OS在提升用户参与度方面的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统意见摘要仅依赖评论，缺乏对产品元数据的整合，限制了摘要的全面性。同时，缺乏评估数据集阻碍了M-OS的进展。

Method: 提出M-OS-EVAL数据集，用于评估多源意见摘要的7个关键维度。通过用户研究和实验验证M-OS的效果。

Result: M-OS显著提升用户参与度，87%的用户更偏好M-OS。M-OS-PROMPTS与人类判断的Spearman相关性达到0.74，优于先前方法。

Conclusion: M-OS通过整合多源数据生成更全面的摘要，显著提升用户参与度。M-OS-EVAL为未来研究提供了评估基准。

Abstract: Multi-source Opinion Summarization (M-OS) extends beyond traditional opinion
summarization by incorporating additional sources of product metadata such as
descriptions, key features, specifications, and ratings, alongside reviews.
This integration results in comprehensive summaries that capture both
subjective opinions and objective product attributes essential for informed
decision-making. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant
success in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, their potential in
M-OS remains largely unexplored. Additionally, the lack of evaluation datasets
for this task has impeded further advancements. To bridge this gap, we
introduce M-OS-EVAL, a benchmark dataset for evaluating multi-source opinion
summaries across 7 key dimensions: fluency, coherence, relevance, faithfulness,
aspect coverage, sentiment consistency, specificity. Our results demonstrate
that M-OS significantly enhances user engagement, as evidenced by a user study
in which, on average, 87% of participants preferred M-OS over opinion
summaries. Our experiments demonstrate that factually enriched summaries
enhance user engagement. Notably, M-OS-PROMPTS exhibit stronger alignment with
human judgment, achieving an average Spearman correlation of \r{ho} = 0.74,
which surpasses the performance of previous methodologies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoSteer是一个协作框架，通过本地化delta steering实现解码时个性化，解决了云端大模型与本地小模型之间的适应性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在资源受限的个人设备上难以实现实时个性化，云端大模型缺乏本地用户信息，而本地小模型生成质量不足。

Method: 利用本地小模型的上下文感知与无关输出的logits差异作为云端大模型的steering信号，通过在线学习动态调整logits。

Result: 实验表明，CoSteer能有效生成个性化内容，保护隐私且计算开销可接受。

Conclusion: CoSteer在隐私保护与计算效率间取得平衡，为个性化文本生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Personalized text generation has become crucial for adapting language models
to diverse and evolving users' personal context across cultural, temporal, and
contextual dimensions. While existing methods often rely on centralized
fine-tuning or static preference alignment, they struggle to achieve real-time
adaptation under resource constraints inherent to personal devices. This
limitation creates a dilemma: large cloud-based models lack access to localized
user-specific information, while small on-device models cannot match the
generation quality of their cloud counterparts. To address this dichotomy, we
present CoSteer, a novel collaborative framework that enables decoding-time
personalization through localized delta steering. Our key insight lies in
leveraging the logits difference between personal context-aware and -agnostic
outputs from local small models as steering signals for cloud-based LLMs.
Specifically, we formulate token-level optimization as an online learning
problem, where local delta vectors dynamically adjust the remote LLM's logits
within the on-device environment. This approach preserves privacy by
transmitting only the final steered tokens rather than raw data or intermediate
vectors, while maintaining cloud-based LLMs' general capabilities without
fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments on various personalized
generation tasks, we demonstrate that CoSteer effectively assists LLMs in
generating personalized content by leveraging locally stored user profiles and
histories, ensuring privacy preservation through on-device data processing
while maintaining acceptable computational overhead.

Motivation: 理解语言模型在记忆标签噪声的同时仍能保持推理能力的原因。

Method: 使用两个可控的合成推理数据集（四位数加法和两跳关系推理）分析记忆行为。

Result: 模型通过分布式编码和异常启发式记忆标签噪声，且推理机制未被覆盖。

Conclusion: 标签噪声的记忆建立在推理机制之上，而非替代它们，揭示了良性记忆现象。

Abstract: Large language models readily memorize arbitrary training instances, such as
label noise, yet they perform strikingly well on reasoning tasks. In this work,
we investigate how language models memorize label noise, and why such
memorization in many cases does not heavily affect generalizable reasoning
capabilities. Using two controllable synthetic reasoning datasets with noisy
labels, four-digit addition (FDA) and two-hop relational reasoning (THR), we
discover a reliance of memorization on generalizable reasoning mechanisms:
models continue to compute intermediate reasoning outputs even when retrieving
memorized noisy labels, and intervening reasoning adversely affects
memorization. We further show that memorization operates through distributed
encoding, i.e., aggregating various inputs and intermediate results, rather
than building a look-up mechanism from inputs to noisy labels. Moreover, our
FDA case study reveals memorization occurs via outlier heuristics, where
existing neuron activation patterns are slightly shifted to fit noisy labels.
Together, our findings suggest that memorization of label noise in language
models builds on, rather than overrides, the underlying reasoning mechanisms,
shedding lights on the intriguing phenomenon of benign memorization.

To bridge this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of pun
generation datasets and methods across different stages, including conventional
approaches, deep learning techniques, and pre-trained language models.
Additionally, we summarise both automated and human evaluation metrics used to
assess the quality of pun generation. Finally, we discuss the research
challenges and propose promising directions for future work.

Method: 提出Spec-TOD框架，结合任务指令调优的LLM和轻量级LLM训练策略。

Result: 在MultiWOZ数据集上表现优异，显著减少标注数据需求。

Conclusion: Spec-TOD在低资源场景下高效且有效，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems facilitate goal-driven interactions
between users and machines. While recent advances in deep learning have
improved the performance, TOD systems often struggle in low-resource scenarios
with limited labeled data. To address this challenge, we propose Spec-TOD, a
novel framework designed to train an end-to-end TOD system with limited data.
Spec-TOD introduces two main innovations: (i) a novel specialized end-to-end
TOD framework that incorporates explicit task instructions for
instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs), and (ii) an efficient training
strategy that leverages lightweight, specialized LLMs to achieve strong
performance with minimal supervision. Experiments on the MultiWOZ dataset, a
widely used TOD benchmark, demonstrate that Spec-TOD achieves competitive
results while significantly reducing the need for labeled data. These findings
highlight the potential of the proposed framework in advancing efficient and
effective TOD systems in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Relation extraction is a crucial task in natural language processing, with
broad applications in knowledge graph construction and literary analysis.
However, the complex context and implicit expressions in novel texts pose
significant challenges for automatic character relationship extraction. This
study focuses on relation extraction in the novel domain and proposes a method
based on Large Language Models (LLMs). By incorporating relationship dimension
separation, dialogue data construction, and contextual learning strategies, the
proposed method enhances extraction performance. Leveraging dialogue structure
information, it improves the model's ability to understand implicit
relationships and demonstrates strong adaptability in complex contexts.
Additionally, we construct a high-quality Chinese novel relation extraction
dataset to address the lack of labeled resources and support future research.
Experimental results show that our method outperforms traditional baselines
across multiple evaluation metrics and successfully facilitates the automated
construction of character relationship networks in novels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，领域特定的OR-CONVQA训练数据难以获取，但组织内存在大量文本文档，可用于自动生成训练数据。

Method: 提出一个流程，利用文本文档自动生成带标注的对话数据，包括问题-答案对、去语境化问题和命题。

Result: 生成的合成对话可用于训练问题重写器，并支持现有检索器和LLM生成系统响应。

Conclusion: 该方法为OR-CONVQA提供了高效的数据生成和训练解决方案。

Abstract: We consider open-retrieval conversational question answering (OR-CONVQA), an
extension of question answering where system responses need to be (i) aware of
dialog history and (ii) grounded in documents (or document fragments) retrieved
per question. Domain-specific OR-CONVQA training datasets are crucial for
real-world applications, but hard to obtain. We propose a pipeline that
capitalizes on the abundance of plain text documents in organizations (e.g.,
product documentation) to automatically produce realistic OR-CONVQA dialogs
with annotations. Similarly to real-world humanannotated OR-CONVQA datasets, we
generate in-dialog question-answer pairs, self-contained (decontextualized,
e.g., no referring expressions) versions of user questions, and propositions
(sentences expressing prominent information from the documents) the system
responses are grounded in. We show how the synthetic dialogs can be used to
train efficient question rewriters that decontextualize user questions,
allowing existing dialog-unaware retrievers to be utilized. The retrieved
information and the decontextualized question are then passed on to an LLM that
generates the system's response.

Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型中语义表示的位置，以促进模型可解释性和架构创新。

Result: 模型在MMLU推理基准上优于传统可训练嵌入模型，表明语义是Transformer架构和数据规模的涌现特性。

Conclusion: 输入嵌入层的角色应从语义容器重构为结构基元，语义是架构和数据的涌现结果。

Abstract: Understanding the locus of semantic representation in large language models
(LLMs) is crucial for interpretability and architectural innovation. The
dominant paradigm posits that trainable input embeddings serve as foundational
"meaning vectors." This paper challenges that view. We construct Transformer
models where the embedding layer is entirely frozen, with vectors derived not
from data, but from the visual structure of Unicode glyphs. These non-semantic,
precomputed visual embeddings are fixed throughout training. Our method is
compatible with any tokenizer, including a novel Unicode-centric tokenizer we
introduce to ensure universal text coverage. Despite the absence of trainable,
semantically initialized embeddings, our models converge, generate coherent
text, and, critically, outperform architecturally identical models with
trainable embeddings on the MMLU reasoning benchmark. We attribute this to
"representational interference" in conventional models, where the embedding
layer is burdened with learning both structural and semantic features. Our
results indicate that high-level semantics are not inherent to input embeddings
but are an emergent property of the Transformer's compositional architecture
and data scale. This reframes the role of embeddings from meaning containers to
structural primitives. We release all code and models to foster further
research.

Conclusion: ArtifactsBench是首个能够可靠自动化评估人类感知质量的框架，揭示了通用模型在性能上常优于领域专用模型，并开源了相关资源以推动用户中心生成模型的发展。

Abstract: The generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly
expanding from static code to dynamic, interactive visual artifacts. This
progress is bottlenecked by a critical evaluation gap: established benchmarks
focus on algorithmic correctness and are blind to the visual fidelity and
interactive integrity that define modern user experiences. To bridge this gap,
we introduce ArtifactsBench, a new benchmark and paradigm for the automated,
multimodal evaluation of visual code generation. Our framework programmatically
renders each generated artifact and captures its dynamic behavior through
temporal screenshots. This visual evidence, alongside the source code, is then
assessed by a Multimodal LLM (MLLM)-as-Judge, which is rigorously guided by a
fine-grained, per-task checklist to ensure holistic and reproducible scoring.
We construct a new benchmark of 1,825 diverse tasks and evaluate over 30
leading LLMs. Our automated evaluation achieves a striking 94.4% ranking
consistency with WebDev Arena, the gold-standard for human preference in web
development, and over 90% pairwise agreement with human experts. This
establishes ArtifactsBench as the first framework to reliably automate the
assessment of human-perceived quality at scale. Our analysis provides a
high-resolution map of the current SOTA, revealing that generalist models often
outperform domain-specific ones. We open-source ArtifactsBench, including the
benchmark, evaluation harness, and baseline results at
https://artifactsbenchmark.github.io/, to provide the community with a scalable
and accurate tool to accelerate the development of user-centric generative
models.

Abstract: We introduce Co-DETECT (Collaborative Discovery of Edge cases in TExt
ClassificaTion), a novel mixed-initiative annotation framework that integrates
human expertise with automatic annotation guided by large language models

provided by a domain expert, then leverages the LLM to annotate the data and
identify edge cases that are not well described by the initial codebook.
Specifically, Co-DETECT flags challenging examples, induces high-level,
generalizable descriptions of edge cases, and assists user in incorporating
edge case handling rules to improve the codebook. This iterative process
enables more effective handling of nuanced phenomena through compact,
generalizable annotation rules. Extensive user study, qualitative and

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模文本数据的透明和可靠信息检索提供了新方向。

Abstract: The volume and diversity of digital information have led to a growing
reliance on Machine Learning techniques, such as Natural Language Processing,
for interpreting and accessing appropriate data. While vector and graph
embeddings represent data for similarity tasks, current state-of-the-art
pipelines lack guaranteed explainability, failing to determine similarity for
given full texts accurately. These considerations can also be applied to
classifiers exploiting generative language models with logical prompts, which
fail to correctly distinguish between logical implication, indifference, and
inconsistency, despite being explicitly trained to recognise the first two
classes. We present a novel pipeline designed for hybrid explainability to
address this. Our methodology combines graphs and logic to produce First-Order
Logic representations, creating machine- and human-readable representations
through Montague Grammar. Preliminary results indicate the effectiveness of
this approach in accurately capturing full text similarity. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first approach to differentiate between implication,
inconsistency, and indifference for text classification tasks. To address the
limitations of existing approaches, we use three self-contained datasets
annotated for the former classification task to determine the suitability of
these approaches in capturing sentence structure equivalence, logical
connectives, and spatiotemporal reasoning. We also use these data to compare
the proposed method with language models pre-trained for detecting sentence
entailment. The results show that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art models, indicating that natural language understanding cannot
be easily generalised by training over extensive document corpora. This work
offers a step toward more transparent and reliable Information Retrieval from
extensive textual data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance natural language processing
with their ability to generate human-like text across a range of tasks. Despite
the remarkable success of LLMs in Natural Language Processing (NLP), their
performance in text summarization across various domains and datasets has not
been comprehensively evaluated. At the same time, the ability to summarize text
effectively without relying on extensive training data has become a crucial
bottleneck. To address these issues, we present a systematic evaluation of six
LLMs across four datasets: CNN/Daily Mail and NewsRoom (news), SAMSum (dialog),
and ArXiv (scientific). By leveraging prompt engineering techniques including
zero-shot and in-context learning, our study evaluates the performance using
the ROUGE and BERTScore metrics. In addition, a detailed analysis of inference
times is conducted to better understand the trade-off between summarization
quality and computational efficiency. For Long documents, introduce a
sentence-based chunking strategy that enables LLMs with shorter context windows
to summarize extended inputs in multiple stages. The findings reveal that while
LLMs perform competitively on news and dialog tasks, their performance on long
scientific documents improves significantly when aided by chunking strategies.
In addition, notable performance variations were observed based on model
parameters, dataset properties, and prompt design. These results offer
actionable insights into how different LLMs behave across task types,
contributing to ongoing research in efficient, instruction-based NLP systems.

Method: 使用直接偏好优化（DPO）对齐模拟学生能力，生成大量响应并通过LLM评分模型评估，拟合IRT模型得到难度估计。

Result: SMART在真实数据集上表现优于其他预测方法。

Conclusion: SMART通过改进的能力对齐，为题目难度预测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Item (question) difficulties play a crucial role in educational assessments,
enabling accurate and efficient assessment of student abilities and
personalization to maximize learning outcomes. Traditionally, estimating item
difficulties can be costly, requiring real students to respond to items,
followed by fitting an item response theory (IRT) model to get item difficulty
estimates. This approach cannot be applied to the cold-start setting for
previously unseen items either. In this work, we present SMART (Simulated
Students Aligned with IRT), a novel method for aligning simulated students with
instructed ability, which can then be used in simulations to predict the
difficulty of open-ended items. We achieve this alignment using direct
preference optimization (DPO), where we form preference pairs based on how
likely responses are under a ground-truth IRT model. We perform a simulation by
generating thousands of responses, evaluating them with an LLM-based scoring
model, and fit the resulting data to an IRT model to obtain item difficulty
estimates. Through extensive experiments on a real-world student response
dataset, we show that SMART outperforms other item difficulty prediction
methods by leveraging its improved ability alignment.

Conclusion: 该方法为学习者提供了可解释且系统的记忆法生成工具，提升了学习效率。

Abstract: Learning Japanese vocabulary is a challenge for learners from Roman alphabet
backgrounds due to script differences. Japanese combines syllabaries like
hiragana with kanji, which are logographic characters of Chinese origin. Kanji
are also complicated due to their complexity and volume. Keyword mnemonics are
a common strategy to aid memorization, often using the compositional structure
of kanji to form vivid associations. Despite recent efforts to use large
language models (LLMs) to assist learners, existing methods for LLM-based
keyword mnemonic generation function as a black box, offering limited
interpretability. We propose a generative framework that explicitly models the
mnemonic construction process as driven by a set of common rules, and learn
them using a novel Expectation-Maximization-type algorithm. Trained on
learner-authored mnemonics from an online platform, our method learns latent
structures and compositional rules, enabling interpretable and systematic
mnemonics generation. Experiments show that our method performs well in the
cold-start setting for new learners while providing insight into the mechanisms
behind effective mnemonic creation.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）生成文本的能力及其滥用问题，提出了区分人工与机器生成文本（Task-A）及识别生成模型（Task-B）的方法，基于GPT_4o-mini、LLaMA 3 8B和BERT的微调实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs生成文本的逼真度和滥用问题日益严重，检测机器生成文本的需求变得迫切。

Method: 通过微调GPT_4o-mini、LLaMA 3 8B和BERT模型，分别完成Task-A（区分人工与机器文本）和Task-B（识别生成模型）。

Result: 微调后的GPT_4o-mini和BERT在Task-A中准确率达0.9547，Task-B中为0.4698。

Conclusion: 研究展示了微调模型在检测机器生成文本方面的潜力，但Task-B的识别仍有提升空间。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess an extraordinary capability to produce
text that is not only coherent and contextually relevant but also strikingly
similar to human writing. They adapt to various styles and genres, producing
content that is both grammatically correct and semantically meaningful.
Recently, LLMs have been misused to create highly realistic phishing emails,
spread fake news, generate code to automate cyber crime, and write fraudulent
scientific articles. Additionally, in many real-world applications, the
generated content including style and topic and the generator model are not
known beforehand. The increasing prevalence and sophistication of artificial
intelligence (AI)-generated texts have made their detection progressively more
challenging. Various attempts have been made to distinguish machine-generated
text from human-authored content using linguistic, statistical, machine
learning, and ensemble-based approaches. This work focuses on two primary
objectives Task-A, which involves distinguishing human-written text from
machine-generated text, and Task-B, which attempts to identify the specific LLM
model responsible for the generation. Both of these tasks are based on fine
tuning of Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT_4o-mini), Large Language
Model Meta AI (LLaMA) 3 8B, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (BERT). The fine-tuned version of GPT_4o-mini and the BERT model
has achieved accuracies of 0.9547 for Task-A and 0.4698 for Task-B.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级方法\ours，通过将FFN层视为关联键值记忆，并在后训练阶段通过前向干预或反向传播正则化来提升语言模型的知识利用效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的后训练方法（如监督微调）未能充分利用预训练阶段获得的知识，因此需要一种更有效的方法来提升模型性能。

Method: 将FFN层作为关联键值记忆，通过前向干预或反向传播正则化来促进存储记忆向量的使用。

Result: 在15个下游任务（包括ID和OOD评估）中，该方法在多种模型家族（如Qwen、Gemma和Llama）上均表现出一致的性能提升。此外，模型能自适应地分配信息，更关注生成语义上有意义的词。

Conclusion: 研究表明，传统的后训练方法未能充分利用预训练潜力，而通过潜在表示空间的引导可以同时提升性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in language models (LMs) gradually ushered in an era
where post-training is crucial. Yet, post-training approaches such as
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) do not guarantee effective use of knowledge
acquired during pretraining. We therefore present \ours, a lightweight method
that encourages parametric information utilization in LMs during post-training.
This is achieved via treating FFN layer as associate key-value memory, and
promotes the use of stored memory vectors via forward-pass interventions or
regularization during backpropagation. We find this simple guidance during
post-training phase delivers consistent performance improvements across diverse
model families--including Qwen, Gemma and Llama-spanning over 15 downstream
tasks in both ID and OOD evaluations. Beyond performance gains, we also find
that steered LMs can adaptively allocate information-placing more emphasis on
generating semantically meaningful tokens, while using fewer resources on
simple transition ones (e.g., `,' or `and'). Our work underscores that vanilla
post-training does not fully leverage pre-training potential, and steering LMs
in latent representation space offers a promising approach that enhances both
performance and interpretability.

Conclusion: OpenS2S为共情语音系统的研究提供了透明且可扩展的工具，有望加速该领域的创新。

Abstract: Empathetic interaction is a cornerstone of human-machine communication, due
to the need for understanding speech enriched with paralinguistic cues and
generating emotional and expressive responses. However, the most powerful
empathetic LSLMs are increasingly closed off, leaving the crucial details about
the architecture, data and development opaque to researchers. Given the
critical need for transparent research into the LSLMs and empathetic behavior,
we present OpenS2S, a fully open-source, transparent and end-to-end LSLM
designed to enable empathetic speech interactions. Based on our empathetic
speech-to-text model BLSP-Emo, OpenS2S further employs a streaming interleaved
decoding architecture to achieve low-latency speech generation. To facilitate
end-to-end training, OpenS2S incorporates an automated data construction
pipeline that synthesizes diverse, high-quality empathetic speech dialogues at
low cost. By leveraging large language models to generate empathetic content
and controllable text-to-speech systems to introduce speaker and emotional
variation, we construct a scalable training corpus with rich paralinguistic
diversity and minimal human supervision. We release the fully open-source
OpenS2S model, including the dataset, model weights, pre-training and
fine-tuning codes, to empower the broader research community and accelerate
innovation in empathetic speech systems. The project webpage can be accessed at

Motivation: 在错误信息泛滥的时代，为印地语等资源匮乏语言生成可靠的新闻解释至关重要，但缺乏自动化工具。

Method: 整合DPO与课程学习，引入Actuality和Finesse参数优化损失函数，利用可信来源的事实核查解释作为偏好响应。

Result: 实验证明该框架能生成连贯且上下文相关的解释，适用于多种模型（如Mistral、Llama、mBART等）。

Conclusion: 该可扩展方法有效应对错误信息，并扩展了自动化解释生成至低资源语言。

Abstract: In an era of rampant misinformation, generating reliable news explanations is
vital, especially for under-represented languages like Hindi. Lacking robust
automated tools, Hindi faces challenges in scaling misinformation detection. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework integrating Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) with curriculum learning to align machine-generated
explanations with human reasoning. Fact-checked explanations from credible
sources serve as preferred responses, while LLM outputs highlight system
limitations and serve as non-preferred responses. To refine task-specific
alignment, we introduce two key parameters -- Actuality and Finesse -- into the
DPO loss function, enhancing explanation quality and consistency. Experiments
with LLMs (Mistral, Llama, Gemma) and PLMs (mBART, mT5) confirm the framework's
effectiveness in generating coherent, contextually relevant explanations. This
scalable approach combats misinformation and extends automated explanation
generation to low-resource languages.

TL;DR: POLAR是一种新颖的奖励建模方法，通过将奖励建模视为策略判别器，捕捉策略间的相对差异，显著提升了奖励模型的性能和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励建模方法依赖绝对偏好，难以捕捉策略间的相对差异，限制了模型的性能和泛化能力。POLAR旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出POLAR预训练方法，训练奖励模型以识别相同策略并区分不同策略，捕捉策略间的相对差异。

Result: POLAR显著提升了奖励模型的性能（如STEM任务准确率从54.8%提升至81.0%），并在RLHF中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: POLAR是一种有前景的奖励建模方向，具备高性能、强泛化和良好的扩展性。

Abstract: We offer a novel perspective on reward modeling by formulating it as a policy
discriminator, which quantifies the difference between two policies to generate
a reward signal, guiding the training policy towards a target policy with
desired behaviors. Based on this conceptual insight, we propose a scalable
pre-training method named Policy Discriminative Learning (POLAR), which trains
a reward model (RM) to discern identical policies and discriminate different
ones. Unlike traditional reward modeling methods relying on absolute
preferences, POLAR captures the relative difference between one policy and an
arbitrary target policy, which is a scalable, high-level optimization objective
suitable for modeling generic ranking relationships. Leveraging the POLAR
pre-training paradigm, we present a series of RMs with parameter scales from
1.8B to 7B. Empirical results show that POLAR substantially outperforms
traditional non-pre-trained methods, significantly enhancing RM performance.
For instance, POLAR-7B could improve preference accuracy from 54.8% to 81.0% on
STEM tasks and from 57.9% to 85.5% on creative writing tasks compared to SOTA
baselines. POLAR also shows robust generalization capabilities in RLHF using
Reinforcement Fine-tuning (RFT), providing reliable reward signals and markedly
enhancing policy performance--improving LLaMa3.1-8B from an average of 47.36%
to 56.33% and Qwen2.5-32B from 64.49% to 70.47% on 20 benchmarks. Moreover,
scaling experiments reveal a clear power-law relationship between computation
and performance, supported by linear correlation coefficients approaching 0.99.
The impressive performance, strong generalization, and scaling properties
suggest that POLAR is a promising direction for developing general and strong
reward models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文揭示了大型语言模型（LLMs）中的上下文启动漏洞，提出了一种名为“响应攻击”的方法，利用辅助LLM生成有害内容，并通过上下文启动引导目标模型生成违规内容。该方法在多个LLMs上表现优于现有攻击技术，同时提出了缓解措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs中上下文启动的潜在漏洞，探索如何通过对话历史操控模型生成违规内容。

Method: 提出“响应攻击”（Response Attack），利用辅助LLM生成有害响应，并通过上下文启动引导目标模型。

Result: 在8个开源和专有LLMs上，该方法攻击成功率高于现有技术。

Conclusion: 通过构建上下文感知的安全微调数据集，显著降低了攻击成功率，同时保留了模型能力。

Abstract: Contextual priming, where earlier stimuli covertly bias later judgments,
offers an unexplored attack surface for large language models (LLMs). We
uncover a contextual priming vulnerability in which the previous response in
the dialogue can steer its subsequent behavior toward policy-violating content.
Building on this insight, we propose Response Attack, which uses an auxiliary
LLM to generate a mildly harmful response to a paraphrased version of the
original malicious query. They are then formatted into the dialogue and
followed by a succinct trigger prompt, thereby priming the target model to
generate harmful content. Across eight open-source and proprietary LLMs, RA
consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art jailbreak techniques, achieving
higher attack success rates. To mitigate this threat, we construct and release
a context-aware safety fine-tuning dataset, which significantly reduces the
attack success rate while preserving model capabilities. The code and data are
available at https://github.com/Dtc7w3PQ/Response-Attack.

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注推理、规划和执行能力，而记忆能力的评估因缺乏相关基准而被忽视。记忆代理的核心能力未被现有数据集全面覆盖。

Method: 结合重构的现有数据集和新构建的数据集，设计MemoryAgentBench，评估多种记忆代理（如基于上下文的系统、RAG系统和具有外部记忆模块的高级代理）。

Result: 实验表明，现有方法在四大核心能力上均表现不足，突显了进一步研究全面记忆机制的必要性。

Conclusion: MemoryAgentBench为记忆代理提供了系统且具有挑战性的测试平台，揭示了当前方法的局限性，推动了记忆机制研究的深入。

Abstract: Recent benchmarks for Large Language Model (LLM) agents primarily focus on
evaluating reasoning, planning, and execution capabilities, while another
critical component-memory, encompassing how agents memorize, update, and
retrieve long-term information-is under-evaluated due to the lack of
benchmarks. We term agents with memory mechanisms as memory agents. In this
paper, we identify four core competencies essential for memory agents: accurate
retrieval, test-time learning, long-range understanding, and conflict
resolution. Existing datasets either rely on limited context lengths or are
tailored for static, long-context settings like book-based QA, which do not
reflect the interactive, multi-turn nature of memory agents that incrementally
accumulate information. Furthermore, no existing benchmarks cover all four
competencies. Therefore, we introduce MemoryAgentBench, a new benchmark
specifically designed for memory agents. Our benchmark combines reformulated
existing datasets with newly constructed ones, covering the above four memory
competencies, providing a systematic and challenging testbed for assessing
memory quality. We evaluate a diverse set of memory agents, ranging from simple
context-based and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to advanced
agents with external memory modules and tool integration. Empirical results
reveal that current methods fall short of mastering all four competencies,
underscoring the need for further research into comprehensive memory mechanisms
for LLM agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖昂贵的LiDAR数据或性能有限的摄像头，无法满足复杂路口的需求。

Method: 利用多方向摄像头图像直接转换为矢量地图，减少中间模块和误差传播。

Result: 在4000个中国城市路口测试中，性能优于现有在线方法，接近LiDAR精度。

Conclusion: MRC-VMap提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案，适用于现代自动驾驶系统。

Abstract: Vectorized maps are indispensable for precise navigation and the safe
operation of autonomous vehicles. Traditional methods for constructing these
maps fall into two categories: offline techniques, which rely on expensive,
labor-intensive LiDAR data collection and manual annotation, and online
approaches that use onboard cameras to reduce costs but suffer from limited
performance, especially at complex intersections. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MRC-VMap, a cost-effective, vision-centric, end-to-end neural network
designed to generate high-definition vectorized maps directly at intersections.
Leveraging existing roadside surveillance cameras, MRC-VMap directly converts
time-aligned, multi-directional images into vectorized map representations.
This integrated solution lowers the need for additional intermediate
modules--such as separate feature extraction and Bird's-Eye View (BEV)
conversion steps--thus reducing both computational overhead and error
propagation. Moreover, the use of multiple camera views enhances mapping
completeness, mitigates occlusions, and provides robust performance under
practical deployment constraints. Extensive experiments conducted on 4,000
intersections across 4 major metropolitan areas in China demonstrate that
MRC-VMap not only outperforms state-of-the-art online methods but also achieves
accuracy comparable to high-cost LiDAR-based approaches, thereby offering a
scalable and efficient solution for modern autonomous navigation systems.

Conclusion: MLLMs在网球视频分析中具有潜力，需进一步优化以填补现有技术空白。

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recent years has also given rise
to the development of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). These new MLLMs allow us to
process images, videos and even audio alongside textual inputs. In this
project, we aim to assess the effectiveness of MLLMs in analysing sports
videos, focusing mainly on tennis videos. Despite research done on tennis
analysis, there remains a gap in models that are able to understand and
identify the sequence of events in a tennis rally, which would be useful in
other fields of sports analytics. As such, we will mainly assess the MLLMs on
their ability to fill this gap - to classify tennis actions, as well as their
ability to identify these actions in a sequence of tennis actions in a rally.
We further looked into ways we can improve the MLLMs' performance, including
different training methods and even using them together with other traditional
models.

Result: 模型预测能力略逊，但权重解释和案例研究显示潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法可作为城市规划和政策制定中识别食品不安全的补充工具。

Abstract: Food insecurity is a significant social and public health issue that plagues
many urban metropolitan areas around the world. Existing approaches to
identifying food insecurity rely primarily on qualitative and quantitative
survey data, which is difficult to scale. This project seeks to explore the
effectiveness of using street-level images in modeling food insecurity at the
census tract level. To do so, we propose a two-step process of feature
extraction and gated attention for image aggregation. We evaluate the
effectiveness of our model by comparing against other model architectures,
interpreting our learned weights, and performing a case study. While our model
falls slightly short in terms of its predictive power, we believe our approach
still has the potential to supplement existing methods of identifying food
insecurity for urban planners and policymakers.

Result: 在开放世界和真实环境中可靠推理，链式检索任务中优于场景方法。

Conclusion: OBSER框架为零样本环境识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present the Object-Based Sub-Environment Recognition (OBSER) framework, a
novel Bayesian framework that infers three fundamental relationships between
sub-environments and their constituent objects. In the OBSER framework, metric
and self-supervised learning models estimate the object distributions of
sub-environments on the latent space to compute these measures. Both
theoretically and empirically, we validate the proposed framework by
introducing the ($\epsilon,\delta$) statistically separable (EDS) function
which indicates the alignment of the representation. Our framework reliably
performs inference in open-world and photorealistic environments and
outperforms scene-based methods in chained retrieval tasks. The OBSER framework
enables zero-shot recognition of environments to achieve autonomous environment
understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI生成游戏视觉资产与游戏叙事不一致的问题，以及训练数据风格分布不均导致的生成内容多样性受限。

Method: 收集艺术家创作的开放许可游戏瓦片，提供语义标注，并开发低分辨率瓦片对象检测流程。

Result: 数据集支持叙事驱动的内容生成，改进了程序化内容生成方法，并为低分辨率非真实感图像的对象检测提供了基准。

Conclusion: GameTileNet是提升PCG方法和支持叙事丰富游戏内容的宝贵资源。

Abstract: GameTileNet is a dataset designed to provide semantic labels for
low-resolution digital game art, advancing procedural content generation (PCG)
and related AI research as a vision-language alignment task. Large Language
Models (LLMs) and image-generative AI models have enabled indie developers to
create visual assets, such as sprites, for game interactions. However,
generating visuals that align with game narratives remains challenging due to
inconsistent AI outputs, requiring manual adjustments by human artists. The
diversity of visual representations in automatically generated game content is
also limited because of the imbalance in distributions across styles for
training data. GameTileNet addresses this by collecting artist-created game
tiles from OpenGameArt.org under Creative Commons licenses and providing
semantic annotations to support narrative-driven content generation. The
dataset introduces a pipeline for object detection in low-resolution tile-based
game art (e.g., 32x32 pixels) and annotates semantics, connectivity, and object
classifications. GameTileNet is a valuable resource for improving PCG methods,
supporting narrative-rich game content, and establishing a baseline for object
detection in low-resolution, non-photorealistic images.
  TL;DR: GameTileNet is a semantic dataset of low-resolution game tiles
designed to support narrative-driven procedural content generation through
visual-language alignment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Temporal Search（TS）的训练免费框架，通过迭代调整时间焦点，提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）对长视频的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在长视频理解中因时间感知效率低下而表现不佳，TS旨在通过动态调整时间焦点解决这一问题。

Method: TS通过两个迭代阶段工作：1）提出可能包含任务相关信息的时间区间；2）从区间采样固定数量帧，生成细化响应和置信度分数。TS-BFS进一步引入最佳优先搜索策略。

Result: TS通过动态调整时间焦点，显著提升了MLLMs对长视频的理解能力，同时降低了内存消耗。

Conclusion: TS为长视频理解提供了一种高效且无需训练的解决方案，未来可进一步优化其搜索策略。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in
video understanding tasks. However, they continue to struggle with long-form
videos because of an inefficient perception of temporal intervals. Unlike
humans, who can dynamically adjust their temporal focus to locate
query-relevant moments, current MLLMs often rely on dense, uniform sampling
across the video timeline, leading to high memory consumption and a risk of
missing crucial information. To address this challenge, we introduce Temporal
Search, a training-free framework that enables MLLMs to explore temporal
regions for improved long video understanding iteratively. TS is based on a key
observation: the model's generation confidence across different temporal
intervals is highly correlated with prediction accuracy. TS operates through
two main iterative stages. First, the MLLM proposes a temporal interval that is
likely to contain task-relevant information. Then, it samples a fixed number of
frames from the interval, regardless of length, and feeds them into the model
to produce a refined response and confidence score. TS refines the focus of the
model by iteratively shifting attention to more fine-grained temporal
intervals, improving its understanding of long videos. Additionally,
keyframe-level descriptions are collected to facilitate cross-interval
perception throughout the video. To further improve efficiency, we introduce
TS-BFS, a best-first search strategy over a tree. Each node represents a
candidate interval and is expanded via two methods: self-driven proposals and
uniform partitioning. Nodes are scored based on confidence and self-evaluation,
and the most promising one is selected for continued exploration.

Conclusion: DriveMRP-10K和DriveMRP-Agent有效提升了VLM在长尾场景中的风险预测能力，并展示了强泛化性能。

Abstract: Autonomous driving has seen significant progress, driven by extensive
real-world data. However, in long-tail scenarios, accurately predicting the
safety of the ego vehicle's future motion remains a major challenge due to
uncertainties in dynamic environments and limitations in data coverage. In this
work, we aim to explore whether it is possible to enhance the motion risk
prediction capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLM) by synthesizing
high-risk motion data. Specifically, we introduce a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) based
motion simulation method to model risks from three aspects: the ego-vehicle,
other vehicles, and the environment. This allows us to synthesize
plug-and-play, high-risk motion data suitable for VLM training, which we call
DriveMRP-10K. Furthermore, we design a VLM-agnostic motion risk estimation
framework, named DriveMRP-Agent. This framework incorporates a novel
information injection strategy for global context, ego-vehicle perspective, and
trajectory projection, enabling VLMs to effectively reason about the spatial
relationships between motion waypoints and the environment. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that by fine-tuning with DriveMRP-10K, our
DriveMRP-Agent framework can significantly improve the motion risk prediction
performance of multiple VLM baselines, with the accident recognition accuracy
soaring from 27.13% to 88.03%. Moreover, when tested via zero-shot evaluation
on an in-house real-world high-risk motion dataset, DriveMRP-Agent achieves a
significant performance leap, boosting the accuracy from base_model's 29.42% to
68.50%, which showcases the strong generalization capabilities of our method in
real-world scenarios.

Result: 配准精度在2.7毫米内，能够准确定位眼角区域。

Conclusion: 该方法为发热筛查提供了高效、准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Fever screening based on infrared thermographs (IRTs) is a viable mass
screening approach during infectious disease pandemics, such as Ebola and SARS,
for temperature monitoring in public places like hospitals and airports. IRTs
have found to be powerful, quick and non-invasive methods to detect elevated
temperatures. Moreover, regions medially adjacent to the inner canthi (called
the canthi regions in this paper) are preferred sites for fever screening.
Accurate localization of the canthi regions can be achieved through multi-modal
registration of infrared (IR) and white-light images. We proposed a
registration method through a coarse-fine registration strategy using different
registration models based on landmarks and edge detection on eye contours. We
evaluated the registration accuracy to be within 2.7 mm, which enables accurate
localization of the canthi regions.

TL;DR: CSAT是一种新型注意力机制，通过压缩感知降低计算复杂度，适用于视觉语言模型（vLLMs），显著提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准注意力机制在vLLMs中因跨模态计算导致高复杂度，CSAT旨在解决这一瓶颈。

Method: 利用随机测量矩阵将高维键值投影到低维空间，通过稀疏恢复算法重构注意力输出。

Result: CSAT显著降低计算复杂度，同时保持语义准确性，适用于视频和语言的高冗余场景。

Conclusion: CSAT为下一代多模态Transformer提供了可扩展、高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (vLLMs) have emerged as powerful architectures for
joint reasoning over visual and textual inputs, enabling breakthroughs in image
captioning, cross modal retrieval, and multimodal dialogue. However, as these
models scale to longer video sequences and richer language descriptions, the
quadratic complexity of the standard attention mechanism presents a fundamental
computational bottleneck. This challenge is exacerbated in vLLMs, where
attention must be computed not only within modalities but also across them,
leading to prohibitive memory and latency costs. In this work, we introduce the
Compressed Sensing Attention Transformer (CSAT), a novel architecture that
reimagines attention computation through the lens of compressed sensing. By
projecting high dimensional key and value representations into a
lower-dimensional subspace via random measurement matrices and reconstructing
the attention outputs using sparse recovery algorithms, CSAT significantly
reduces attention complexity while maintaining semantic fidelity. Applied to
vLLMs, CSAT exploits the inherent compressibility of both visual and textual
representations especially evident in video, where temporal redundancy is high,
and in language, where cross-modal grounding is often sparse. In contrast to
LLMs, which must often model entangled symbolic dependencies, vLLMs benefit
from structured sparsity in alignment and scene composition, making them
particularly well-suited to compressed attention. We provide a formal
mathematical treatment of CSAT, demonstrate its integration into vision
language pipelines, and validate its performance on standard benchmarks,
highlighting its promise as a scalable, interpretable, and resource efficient
solution for next generation multimodal transformers.

Motivation: 传统PCB缺陷检测算法对目标图像的角度、方向和清晰度要求严格，限制了实际应用效果。

Method: 提出多样化场景增强（DSE）方法扩展数据集，并引入关键对象聚焦（KOF）机制增强小目标特征的细粒度学习。

Result: 改进算法在原测试图像上mAP达98.9%，在视角偏移测试图像上mAP为94.7%，显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: VR-YOLO在保持低计算成本的同时，显著提升了PCB缺陷检测的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: The integration of large-scale circuits and systems emphasizes the importance
of automated defect detection of electronic components. The YOLO image
detection model has been used to detect PCB defects and it has become a typical
AI-assisted case of traditional industrial production. However, conventional
detection algorithms have stringent requirements for the angle, orientation,
and clarity of target images. In this paper, we propose an enhanced PCB defect
detection algorithm, named VR-YOLO, based on the YOLOv8 model. This algorithm
aims to improve the model's generalization performance and enhance viewpoint
robustness in practical application scenarios. We first propose a diversified
scene enhancement (DSE) method by expanding the PCB defect dataset by
incorporating diverse scenarios and segmenting samples to improve target
diversity. A novel key object focus (KOF) scheme is then presented by
considering angular loss and introducing an additional attention mechanism to
enhance fine-grained learning of small target features. Experimental results
demonstrate that our improved PCB defect detection approach achieves a mean
average precision (mAP) of 98.9% for the original test images, and 94.7% for
the test images with viewpoint shifts (horizontal and vertical shear
coefficients of $\pm 0.06$ and rotation angle of $\pm 10$ degrees), showing
significant improvements compared to the baseline YOLO model with negligible
additional computational cost.

Motivation: 传统对抗攻击仅针对单张图像，缺乏多样性和概念保持能力，因此需要一种更全面的方法。

Method: 采用概率生成模型或图像集表示概念，从中采样生成多样化的对抗样本，保持原始概念。

Result: 实验证明该方法能生成更多样化的对抗样本，有效保持概念，同时提高攻击效率。

Conclusion: 概念对抗攻击框架在多样性和概念保持上优于传统方法，具有更高的攻击效率。

Abstract: We propose a concept-based adversarial attack framework that extends beyond
single-image perturbations by adopting a probabilistic perspective. Rather than
modifying a single image, our method operates on an entire concept --
represented by a probabilistic generative model or a set of images -- to
generate diverse adversarial examples. Preserving the concept is essential, as
it ensures that the resulting adversarial images remain identifiable as
instances of the original underlying category or identity. By sampling from
this concept-based adversarial distribution, we generate images that maintain
the original concept but vary in pose, viewpoint, or background, thereby
misleading the classifier. Mathematically, this framework remains consistent
with traditional adversarial attacks in a principled manner. Our theoretical
and empirical results demonstrate that concept-based adversarial attacks yield
more diverse adversarial examples and effectively preserve the underlying
concept, while achieving higher attack efficiency.

Conclusion: 该框架展示了在印度全国范围内提供可扩展、季节内农场级作物类型数据的潜力，为农业监测和管理提供了数据驱动的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate, timely, and farm-level crop type information is paramount for
national food security, agricultural policy formulation, and economic planning,
particularly in agriculturally significant nations like India. While remote
sensing and machine learning have become vital tools for crop monitoring,
existing approaches often grapple with challenges such as limited geographical
scalability, restricted crop type coverage, the complexities of mixed-pixel and
heterogeneous landscapes, and crucially, the robust in-season identification
essential for proactive decision-making.
  We present a framework designed to address the critical data gaps for
targeted data driven decision making which generates farm-level, in-season,
multi-crop identification at national scale (India) using deep learning. Our
methodology leverages the strengths of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite
imagery, integrated with national-scale farm boundary data. The model
successfully identifies 12 major crops (which collectively account for nearly
90% of India's total cultivated area showing an agreement with national crop
census 2023-24 of 94% in winter, and 75% in monsoon season). Our approach
incorporates an automated season detection algorithm, which estimates crop
sowing and harvest periods. This allows for reliable crop identification as
early as two months into the growing season and facilitates rigorous in-season
performance evaluation. Furthermore, we have engineered a highly scalable
inference pipeline, culminating in what is, to our knowledge, the first
pan-India, in-season, farm-level crop type data product. The system's
effectiveness and scalability are demonstrated through robust validation
against national agricultural statistics, showcasing its potential to deliver
actionable, data-driven insights for transformative agricultural monitoring and
management across India.

Abstract: This study explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and the
visualization of Biblical narratives by analyzing AI-generated images of Exodus
2:5-9 (Moses found in River Nile) using MidJourney. Drawing on the classical
concepts of mimesis (imitation) and poiesis (creative generation), the authors
investigate how text-to-image (T2I) models reproduce or reimagine sacred
narratives. Through comparative visual analysis, including Google image results
and classical paintings, the research evaluates the stylistic, theological, and
cultural dimensions of AI-generated depictions. Findings show that while AI
excels in producing aesthetically rich and imaginative visuals, it also
reflects the biases and limitations of its training data. The study highlights
AI's potential to augment human imagination but questions its capacity for
genuine creativity, authorial intent, and theological depth. It concludes by
suggesting that AI can serve as a creative partner in reinterpreting biblical
texts, though its role in sacred art remains complex and contested.

Result: 几乎所有模型在空间变形推理任务中表现不佳，即使经过针对性训练和主流推理增强方法仍无法胜任。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在空间变形推理能力上存在明显不足，需进一步研究提升。

Abstract: Humans naturally possess the spatial reasoning ability to form and manipulate
images and structures of objects in space. There is an increasing effort to
endow Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with similar spatial reasoning
capabilities. However, it remains unclear whether these models truly understand
and manipulate spatial objects or not. To address this question, we propose a
new evaluation framework aimed at assessing the performance of VLMs in spatial
deformation reasoning tasks. Specifically, we construct a benchmark for spatial
deformation reasoning from 2D to 3D. Leveraging our data engine, we can
generate unlimited evaluation problem pairs with infinite steps, without any
data leakage. We explore whether the model can effectively perform spatial
deformation reasoning from two directions: forward reasoning (given the
operations, find the final state) and reverse reasoning (given the final state,
determine the operations). We adopt a ladder competition format, using the
number of deformation steps as the level classification criterion, with the
goal of exploring the boundaries of the model's deformation reasoning
capabilities. Interestingly, the benchmarking results reveal that almost no
model demonstrates plausible spatial deformation reasoning abilities.
Furthermore, even after applying targeted training and mainstream reasoning
enhancement methods, the models are still unable to perform well on 3D spatial
deformation reasoning.

Conclusion: IMET为医学图像分析提供了一种高效且通用的训练方法，尤其在处理噪声和边缘案例时表现突出。

Abstract: Deep learning models have proven to be effective on medical datasets for
accurate diagnostic predictions from images. However, medical datasets often
contain noisy, mislabeled, or poorly generalizable images, particularly for
edge cases and anomalous outcomes. Additionally, high quality datasets are
often small in sample size that can result in overfitting, where models
memorize noise rather than learn generalizable patterns. This in particular,
could pose serious risks in medical diagnostics where the risk associated with
mis-classification can impact human life. Several data-efficient training
strategies have emerged to address these constraints. In particular, coreset
selection identifies compact subsets of the most representative samples,
enabling training that approximates full-dataset performance while reducing
computational overhead. On the other hand, curriculum learning relies on
gradually increasing training difficulty and accelerating convergence. However,
developing a generalizable difficulty ranking mechanism that works across
diverse domains, datasets, and models while reducing the computational tasks
and remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce Iterative
Misclassification Error Training (IMET), a novel framework inspired by
curriculum learning and coreset selection. The IMET approach is aimed to
identify misclassified samples in order to streamline the training process,
while prioritizing the model's attention to edge case senarious and rare
outcomes. The paper evaluates IMET's performance on benchmark medical image
classification datasets against state-of-the-art ResNet architectures. The
results demonstrating IMET's potential for enhancing model robustness and
accuracy in medical image analysis are also presented in the paper.

Motivation: 解决多模态学习中深度融合与计算可扩展性之间的矛盾，特别是交叉注意力模型的二次复杂度问题。

Conclusion: GRF为强大且可扩展的多模态表示学习提供了高效范式。

Abstract: Multimodal learning faces a fundamental tension between deep, fine-grained
fusion and computational scalability. While cross-attention models achieve
strong performance through exhaustive pairwise fusion, their quadratic
complexity is prohibitive for settings with many modalities. We address this
challenge with Gated Recurrent Fusion (GRF), a novel architecture that captures
the power of cross-modal attention within a linearly scalable, recurrent
pipeline. Our method processes modalities sequentially, updating an evolving
multimodal context vector at each step. The core of our approach is a fusion
block built on Transformer Decoder layers that performs symmetric
cross-attention, mutually enriching the shared context and the incoming
modality. This enriched information is then integrated via a Gated Fusion Unit
(GFU) a GRU-inspired mechanism that dynamically arbitrates information flow,
enabling the model to selectively retain or discard features. This stateful,
recurrent design scales linearly with the number of modalities, O(n), making it
ideal for high-modality environments. Experiments on the CMU-MOSI benchmark
demonstrate that GRF achieves competitive performance compared to more complex
baselines. Visualizations of the embedding space further illustrate that GRF
creates structured, class-separable representations through its progressive
fusion mechanism. Our work presents a robust and efficient paradigm for
powerful, scalable multimodal representation learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种自监督框架，利用医学数据集的内在结构（如多视图X光片），无需文本监督即可生成信息丰富的表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建泛化性强的医疗AI系统需要数据高效且领域感知的预训练策略，但临床数据集（如MIMIC-CXR）图像数量有限且标注稀缺。

Method: 将配对的胸部X光片（正视图和侧视图）作为自然正对，学习从稀疏补丁重建每个视图，并对其潜在嵌入进行对齐。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR上表现优于监督目标和未利用结构的基线方法。

Conclusion: 为数据稀缺但结构化的领域特定预训练提供了轻量级、模态无关的蓝图。

Abstract: Building generalizable medical AI systems requires pretraining strategies
that are data-efficient and domain-aware. Unlike internet-scale corpora,
clinical datasets such as MIMIC-CXR offer limited image counts and scarce
annotations, but exhibit rich internal structure through multi-view imaging. We
propose a self-supervised framework that leverages the inherent structure of
medical datasets. Specifically, we treat paired chest X-rays (i.e., frontal and
lateral views) as natural positive pairs, learning to reconstruct each view
from sparse patches while aligning their latent embeddings. Our method requires
no textual supervision and produces informative representations. Evaluated on
MIMIC-CXR, we show strong performance compared to supervised objectives and
baselines being trained without leveraging structure. This work provides a
lightweight, modality-agnostic blueprint for domain-specific pretraining where
data is structured but scarce

Abstract: This work introduces VISY-REVE: a novel pipeline to validate image processing
algorithms for Vision-Based Navigation. Traditional validation methods such as
synthetic rendering or robotic testbed acquisition suffer from difficult setup
and slow runtime. Instead, we propose augmenting image datasets in real-time
with synthesized views at novel poses. This approach creates continuous
trajectories from sparse, pre-existing datasets in open or closed-loop. In
addition, we introduce a new distance metric between camera poses, the
Boresight Deviation Distance, which is better suited for view synthesis than
existing metrics. Using it, a method for increasing the density of image
datasets is developed.

TL;DR: FreqCross是一种多模态融合网络，结合空间RGB特征、频域伪影和径向能量分布模式，用于检测AI生成图像，准确率达97.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion 3.5）生成高度逼真的合成图像，现有检测方法面临挑战。

Method: 采用三分支架构：ResNet-18提取空间特征，轻量CNN处理2D FFT幅度谱，MLP分析径向能量分布。通过特征拼接和分类头实现多模态融合。

Result: 在10,000对真实与合成图像数据集上，FreqCross准确率达97.8%，优于现有方法5.2%。

Conclusion: FreqCross通过频域分析揭示了合成图像的独特频谱特征，为检测AI生成图像提供了有效方法。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion 3.5,
has enabled the generation of highly photorealistic synthetic images that pose
significant challenges to existing detection methods. This paper presents
FreqCross, a novel multi-modal fusion network that combines spatial RGB
features, frequency domain artifacts, and radial energy distribution patterns
to achieve robust detection of AI-generated images. Our approach leverages a
three-branch architecture: (1) a ResNet-18 backbone for spatial feature
extraction, (2) a lightweight CNN for processing 2D FFT magnitude spectra, and
(3) a multi-layer perceptron for analyzing radial energy profiles. We introduce
a novel radial energy distribution analysis that captures characteristic
frequency artifacts inherent in diffusion-generated images, and fuse it with
spatial and spectral cues via simple feature concatenation followed by a
compact classification head. Extensive experiments on a dataset of 10,000
paired real (MS-COCO) and synthetic (Stable Diffusion 3.5) images demonstrate
that FreqCross achieves 97.8\% accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art
baselines by 5.2\%. The frequency analysis further reveals that synthetic
images exhibit distinct spectral signatures in the 0.1--0.4 normalised
frequency range, providing theoretical foundation for our approach. Code and
pre-trained models are publicly available to facilitate reproducible research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于步态视频的非侵入性脊柱侧弯检测方法TG-MILNet，结合动态时间规整和注意力机制，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期脊柱侧弯检测困难，传统X射线方法有辐射风险且依赖专家经验，需要一种非侵入性、可大规模筛查的解决方案。

Method: 采用动态时间规整（DTW）分割步态视频关键阶段，引入跨袋时序注意力（IBTA）机制和边界感知模型（BAM），并结合文本指导增强特征表示。

Result: 在Scoliosis1K数据集上表现优异，尤其在类别不平衡和边界病例检测中达到先进水平。

Conclusion: TG-MILNet为非侵入性脊柱侧弯筛查提供了高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Early-stage scoliosis is often difficult to detect, particularly in
adolescents, where delayed diagnosis can lead to serious health issues.
Traditional X-ray-based methods carry radiation risks and rely heavily on
clinical expertise, limiting their use in large-scale screenings. To overcome
these challenges, we propose a Text-Guided Multi-Instance Learning Network
(TG-MILNet) for non-invasive scoliosis detection using gait videos. To handle
temporal misalignment in gait sequences, we employ Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
clustering to segment videos into key gait phases. To focus on the most
relevant diagnostic features, we introduce an Inter-Bag Temporal Attention
(IBTA) mechanism that highlights critical gait phases. Recognizing the
difficulty in identifying borderline cases, we design a Boundary-Aware Model
(BAM) to improve sensitivity to subtle spinal deviations. Additionally, we
incorporate textual guidance from domain experts and large language models
(LLM) to enhance feature representation and improve model interpretability.
Experiments on the large-scale Scoliosis1K gait dataset show that TG-MILNet
achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly excelling in handling class
imbalance and accurately detecting challenging borderline cases. The code is

TL;DR: 比较HOG和TDA在视网膜图像分类中的表现，XGBoost在两种方法中均表现最佳，两者性能接近但捕捉不同图像特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索梯度基（HOG）和拓扑（TDA）特征提取方法在医学图像分类中的效果，填补视网膜图像领域的空白。

Method: 使用HOG和TDA分别提取特征，训练七种经典机器学习模型，通过10折交叉验证评估性能。

Result: XGBoost在二分类和多分类任务中表现最佳，HOG和TDA准确率相近（二分类约94%，多分类约74%）。

Conclusion: HOG和TDA在视网膜图像分类中均有效，捕捉不同结构特征，适用于其他医学图像领域并可集成到深度学习流程中。

Abstract: We present the first comparative study of two fundamentally distinct feature
extraction techniques: Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Topological
Data Analysis (TDA), for medical image classification using retinal fundus
images. HOG captures local texture and edge patterns through gradient
orientation histograms, while TDA, using cubical persistent homology, extracts
high-level topological signatures that reflect the global structure of pixel
intensities. We evaluate both methods on the large APTOS dataset for two
classification tasks: binary detection (normal versus diabetic retinopathy) and
five-class diabetic retinopathy severity grading. From each image, we extract
26244 HOG features and 800 TDA features, using them independently to train
seven classical machine learning models with 10-fold cross-validation. XGBoost
achieved the best performance in both cases: 94.29 percent accuracy (HOG) and
94.18 percent (TDA) on the binary task; 74.41 percent (HOG) and 74.69 percent
(TDA) on the multi-class task. Our results show that both methods offer
competitive performance but encode different structural aspects of the images.
This is the first work to benchmark gradient-based and topological features on
retinal imagery. The techniques are interpretable, applicable to other medical
imaging domains, and suitable for integration into deep learning pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监测运动员的个体表现对教练制定合适的训练计划至关重要，因此需要一种高效的方法来估计步幅和速度。

Method: 结合概率霍夫变换和人体姿态检测算法，通过视频分析估计跑步者的腿部关节位置，并利用单应性变换计算步幅。

Result: 在多种比赛视频中对三名不同跑步者的实验表明，该系统是教练和训练的有用工具。

Conclusion: 该方法在测量和监测运动员步态参数方面具有潜在价值。

Abstract: Performance measures such as stride length in athletics and the pace of
runners can be estimated using different tricks such as measuring the number of
steps divided by the running length or helping with markers printed on the
track. Monitoring individual performance is essential for supporting staff
coaches in establishing a proper training schedule for each athlete. The aim of
this paper is to investigate a computer vision-based approach for estimating
stride length and speed transition from video sequences and assessing video
analysis processing among athletes. Using some well-known image processing
methodologies such as probabilistic hough transform combined with a human pose
detection algorithm, we estimate the leg joint position of runners. In this
way, applying a homography transformation, we can estimate the runner stride
length. Experiments on various race videos with three different runners
demonstrated that the proposed system represents a useful tool for coaching and
training. This suggests its potential value in measuring and monitoring the
gait parameters of athletes.

### [172] [Look-Back: Implicit Visual Re-focusing in MLLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03019)
*Shuo Yang,Yuwei Niu,Yuyang Liu,Yang Ye,Bin Lin,Li Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Look-Back的隐式方法，指导多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在推理过程中自主重新关注视觉信息，无需显式注入视觉信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在推理后期过度依赖文本信息，忽视了视觉输入的整合，限制了其多模态推理能力。

Method: 通过分析MLLM的注意力模式，发现适当引导下，MLLMs能自发重新关注视觉输入。基于此，提出了Look-Back方法，让模型自主决定何时、何地及如何重新关注视觉信息。

Result: Look-Back显著提升了模型的推理和感知能力，在多个多模态基准测试中表现出色。

Conclusion: Look-Back展示了MLLMs具备内在的视觉融合推理能力，为多模态推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal reasoning. However, they often excessively rely on textual
information during the later stages of inference, neglecting the crucial
integration of visual input. Current methods typically address this by
explicitly injecting visual information to guide the reasoning process. In this
work, through an analysis of MLLM attention patterns, we made an intriguing
observation: with appropriate guidance, MLLMs can spontaneously re-focus their
attention on visual inputs during the later stages of reasoning, even without
explicit visual information injection. This spontaneous shift in focus suggests
that MLLMs are intrinsically capable of performing visual fusion reasoning.
Building on this insight, we introduce Look-Back, an implicit approach designed
to guide MLLMs to ``look back" at visual information in a self-directed manner
during reasoning. Look-Back empowers the model to autonomously determine when,
where, and how to re-focus on visual inputs, eliminating the need for explicit
model-structure constraints or additional input. We demonstrate that Look-Back
significantly enhances the model's reasoning and perception capabilities, as
evidenced by extensive empirical evaluations on multiple multimodal benchmarks.

Abstract: The importance of rapid and accurate histologic analysis of surgical tissue
in the operating room has been recognized for over a century. Our
standard-of-care intraoperative pathology workflow is based on light microscopy
and H\&E histology, which is slow, resource-intensive, and lacks real-time
digital imaging capabilities. Here, we present an emerging and innovative
method for intraoperative histologic analysis, called Intelligent Histology,
that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) with stimulated Raman histology
(SRH). SRH is a rapid, label-free, digital imaging method for real-time
microscopic tumor tissue analysis. SRH generates high-resolution digital images
of surgical specimens within seconds, enabling AI-driven tumor histologic
analysis, molecular classification, and tumor infiltration detection. We review
the scientific background, clinical translation, and future applications of
intelligent histology in tumor neurosurgery. We focus on the major scientific
and clinical studies that have demonstrated the transformative potential of
intelligent histology across multiple neurosurgical specialties, including
neurosurgical oncology, skull base, spine oncology, pediatric tumors, and
periperal nerve tumors. Future directions include the development of AI
foundation models through multi-institutional datasets, incorporating clinical
and radiologic data for multimodal learning, and predicting patient outcomes.
Intelligent histology represents a transformative intraoperative workflow that
can reinvent real-time tumor analysis for 21st century neurosurgery.

capabilities of the system. With a precise focus on real-time object detection,
this method is poised to deliver significant contributions to the existing
technologies in railway safety. The effectiveness of the proposed method is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着扩散模型生成的图像越来越逼真，区分真实与生成图像变得困难，亟需开发泛化性强的检测器。

Method: LATTE通过建模潜在嵌入在多步去噪过程中的轨迹，结合潜在-视觉特征细化模块和轻量级分类器，实现高效检测。

Result: 实验表明，LATTE在多个基准测试（如GenImage和DiffusionFake）上优于基线方法，并在跨生成器和跨数据集场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: LATTE证明了利用潜在嵌入轨迹进行生成图像检测的潜力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion-based image generators has made it
increasingly difficult to distinguish generated from real images. This can
erode trust in digital media, making it critical to develop generalizable
detectors for generated images. Recent methods leverage diffusion denoising
cues, but mainly focus on single-step reconstruction errors, ignoring the
inherent sequential nature of the denoising process. In this work, we propose
LATTE - Latent Trajectory Embedding - a novel approach that models the
evolution of latent embeddings across several denoising timesteps. By modeling
the trajectory of such embeddings rather than single-step errors, LATTE
captures subtle, discriminative patterns that distinguish real from generated
images. Each latent is refined by employing our latent-visual feature
refinement module and aggregated into a unified representation. Afterwards, it
is fused with the visual features and finally passed into a lightweight
classifier. Our experiments demonstrate that LATTE surpasses the baselines on
several established benchmarks, such as GenImage and DiffusionFake. Moreover,
it demonstrates strong performance in cross-generator and cross-datasets
settings, highlighting the potential of using the trajectory of latent
embeddings for generated image detection. The code is available on the

Motivation: 现有研究主要从技术或外部驱动因素解释VLMs的幻觉行为，忽略了其可能反映人类心理学中的认知偏见。

Method: 引入心理学分类法，设计AIpsych基准测试，分析模型架构和参数规模对行为的影响。

Result: 模型规模增大时，VLMs的迎合倾向增强，权威偏见减少；人类实验验证了假设。

Conclusion: 论文为理解VLMs幻觉提供了新视角，强调将心理学原则融入模型评估的重要性。

Abstract: Hallucination is a long-standing problem that has been actively investigated
in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Existing research commonly attributes
hallucinations to technical limitations or sycophancy bias, where the latter
means the models tend to generate incorrect answers to align with user
expectations. However, these explanations primarily focus on technical or
externally driven factors, may have neglected the possibility that
hallucination behaviours might mirror cognitive biases observed in human
psychology. In this work, we introduce a psychological taxonomy, categorizing
VLMs' hallucination behaviours, including sycophancy, logical inconsistency,
and a newly identified VLMs behaviour: authority bias. To systematically
analyze these behaviours, we design AIpsych, a scalable benchmark that reveals
psychological tendencies in model response patterns. Leveraging this benchmark,
we investigate how variations in model architecture and parameter size
influence model behaviour when responding to strategically manipulated
questions. Our experiments reveal that as model size increases, VLMs exhibit
stronger sycophantic tendencies but reduced authority bias, suggesting
increasing competence but a potential erosion of response integrity. A human
subject study further validates our hypotheses and highlights key behavioural
differences between VLMs and human respondents. This work suggests a new
perspective for understanding hallucination in VLMs and highlights the
importance of integrating psychological principles into model evaluation.The
benchmark is available at https://github.com/lxrswdd/AIpsych.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EBM在高风险应用中具有优势，但在大气科学中尚未广泛应用。本文旨在开发可解释的机器学习算法，用于气象应用，并以OT检测为例。

Method: 通过数学方法提取关键特征（如云纹理），应用EBM进行分类任务，结合卫星数据训练模型，并调整模型以匹配领域科学家的策略。

Result: 开发了一个完全可解释的机器学习算法，虽然精度不及复杂方法，但表现良好，为气象应用的可解释算法迈出重要一步。

Conclusion: EBM结合特征工程可开发可解释的机器学习算法，适用于气象应用，未来可进一步优化。

Abstract: An Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) is an interpretable machine learning
(ML) algorithm that has benefits in high risk applications but has not yet
found much use in atmospheric science. The overall goal of this work is
twofold: (1) explore the use of EBMs, in combination with feature engineering,
to obtain interpretable, physics-based machine learning algorithms for
meteorological applications; (2) illustrate these methods for the detection of
overshooting top (OTs) in satellite imagery.
  Specifically, we seek to simplify the process of OT detection by first using
mathematical methods to extract key features, such as cloud texture using
Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrices, followed by applying an EBM. Our EBM focuses
on the classification task of predicting OT regions, utilizing Channel 2
(visible imagery) and Channel 13 (infrared imagery) of the Advanced Baseline
Imager sensor of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite 16.
Multi-Radar/Multi-Sensor system convection flags are used as labels to train
the EBM model. Note, however, that detecting convection, while related, is
different from detecting OTs.
  Once trained, the EBM was examined and minimally altered to more closely
match strategies used by domain scientists to identify OTs. The result of our
efforts is a fully interpretable ML algorithm that was developed in a
human-machine collaboration. While the final model does not reach the accuracy
of more complex approaches, it performs well and represents a significant step
toward building fully interpretable ML algorithms for this and other
meteorological applications.

Abstract: Sudden Death Syndrome (SDS), caused by Fusarium virguliforme, poses a
significant threat to soybean production. This study presents an AI-driven web
application for early detection of SDS on soybean leaves using hyperspectral
imaging, enabling diagnosis prior to visible symptom onset. Leaf samples from
healthy and inoculated plants were scanned using a portable hyperspectral
imaging system (398-1011 nm), and a Genetic Algorithm was employed to select
five informative wavelengths (505.4, 563.7, 712.2, 812.9, and 908.4 nm)
critical for discriminating infection status. These selected bands were fed
into a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract
spatial-spectral features, which were subsequently classified using ten
classical machine learning models. Ensemble classifiers (Random Forest,
AdaBoost), Linear SVM, and Neural Net achieved the highest accuracy (>98%) and
minimal error across all folds, as confirmed by confusion matrices and
cross-validation metrics. Poor performance by Gaussian Process and QDA
highlighted their unsuitability for this dataset. The trained models were
deployed within a web application that enables users to upload hyperspectral
leaf images, visualize spectral profiles, and receive real-time classification
results. This system supports rapid and accessible plant disease diagnostics,
contributing to precision agriculture practices. Future work will expand the
training dataset to encompass diverse genotypes, field conditions, and disease
stages, and will extend the system for multiclass disease classification and
broader crop applicability.

Abstract: Like many countries, Nigeria is naturally endowed with fertile agricultural
soil that supports large-scale tomato production. However, the prevalence of
disease causing pathogens poses a significant threat to tomato health, often
leading to reduced yields and, in severe cases, the extinction of certain
species. These diseases jeopardise both the quality and quantity of tomato
harvests, contributing to food insecurity. Fortunately, tomato diseases can
often be visually identified through distinct forms, appearances, or textures,
typically first visible on leaves and fruits. This study presents an enhanced
Capsule-YOLO network architecture designed to automatically segment overlapping
and occluded tomato leaf images from complex backgrounds using the YOLO
framework. It identifies disease symptoms with impressive performance metrics:
99.31% accuracy, 98.78% recall, and 99.09% precision, and a 98.93% F1-score
representing improvements of 2.91%, 1.84%, 5.64%, and 4.12% over existing
state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, a user-friendly interface was developed
to allow farmers and users to upload images of affected tomato plants and
detect early disease symptoms. The system also provides recommendations for
appropriate diagnosis and treatment. The effectiveness of this approach
promises significant benefits for the agricultural sector by enhancing crop
yields and strengthening food security.

Result: 方法能准确获取旋转率，并通过仿真和真实视频数据验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为刚体旋转分析提供了一种高效、通用的解决方案，适用于并行处理和场景分割。

Abstract: We demonstrate that, under orthographic projection and with a camera fixated
on a point located on a rigid body, the rotation of that body can be
analytically obtained by tracking only one other feature in the image. With
some exceptions, any tracked point, regardless of its location on the body,
yields the same value of the instantaneous rotation rate.
  The proposed method is independent of the shape of the 3D object and does not
require a priori knowledge about the scene. This algorithm is suited for
parallel processing and can achieve segmentation of the scene by distinguishing
points that do not belong to the same rigid body, simply because they do not
produce the same value of the rotation. This paper presents an analytical
derivation, simulation results, and results from real video data.

*Yavuz Yarici,Kiran Kokilepersaud,Mohit Prabhushankar,Ghassan AlRegib*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SICL的损失函数，用于改进自监督对比学习在人类活动识别中的泛化能力，通过抑制主体特异性信息，强调活动特异性特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据标注成本高，自监督学习方法（如对比学习）在人类活动识别（HAR）中具有吸引力。然而，HAR传感器信号因主体变异性存在显著领域偏移，导致模型难以泛化到新主体。

Method: 提出Subject-Invariant Contrastive Learning（SICL），通过重新加权来自同一主体的负样本对，抑制主体特异性信息，突出活动特异性特征。

Result: 在UTD-MHAD、MMAct和DARai三个基准测试中，SICL比传统对比学习方法性能提升高达11%。

Conclusion: SICL是一种简单有效的损失函数，能够显著提升HAR模型的泛化能力，并适用于多种自监督和监督学习场景。

Abstract: The high cost of annotating data makes self-supervised approaches, such as
contrastive learning methods, appealing for Human Activity Recognition (HAR).
Effective contrastive learning relies on selecting informative positive and
negative samples. However, HAR sensor signals are subject to significant domain
shifts caused by subject variability. These domain shifts hinder model
generalization to unseen subjects by embedding subject-specific variations
rather than activity-specific features. As a result, human activity recognition
models trained with contrastive learning often struggle to generalize to new
subjects. We introduce Subject-Invariant Contrastive Learning (SICL), a simple
yet effective loss function to improve generalization in human activity
recognition. SICL re-weights negative pairs drawn from the same subject to
suppress subject-specific cues and emphasize activity-specific information. We
evaluate our loss function on three public benchmarks: UTD-MHAD, MMAct, and
DARai. We show that SICL improves performance by up to 11% over traditional
contrastive learning methods. Additionally, we demonstrate the adaptability of
our loss function across various settings, including multiple self-supervised
methods, multimodal scenarios, and supervised learning frameworks.

Method: 提出一种轻量级的适配器网络和训练方法，结合3D几何条件化，支持相机控制和场景上下文感知。

Result: 模型在少量监督数据下表现出色，支持直观的图像编辑和风格化，如对象定位、旋转和缩放。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了图像合成的3D一致性和应用多样性，适用于多种创作流程。

Abstract: Existing generative approaches for guided image synthesis of multi-object
scenes typically rely on 2D controls in the image or text space. As a result,
these methods struggle to maintain and respect consistent three-dimensional
geometric structure, underlying the scene. In this paper, we propose a novel
conditioning approach, training method and adapter network that can be plugged
into pretrained text-to-image diffusion models. Our approach provides a way to
endow such models with 3D-awareness, while leveraging their rich prior
knowledge. Our method supports camera control, conditioning on explicit 3D
geometries and, for the first time, accounts for the entire context of a scene,
i.e., both on and off-screen items, to synthesize plausible and semantically
rich images. Despite its multi-modal nature, our model is lightweight, requires
a reasonable number of data for supervised learning and shows remarkable
generalization power. We also introduce methods for intuitive and consistent
image editing and restyling, e.g., by positioning, rotating or resizing
individual objects in a scene. Our method integrates well within various image
creation workflows and enables a richer set of applications compared to
previous approaches.

TL;DR: 研究发现多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）中多视觉编码器存在冗余现象，提出条件利用率（CUR）和信息差距（IG）作为量化工具，证实部分编码器对性能贡献甚微甚至负面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视觉编码器旨在提升视觉理解能力，但实际表现增益有限甚至导致性能下降，需系统研究其冗余问题。

Method: 通过全面的消融实验分析多编码器MLLMs，提出CUR和IG量化编码器贡献与效用差异。

Result: 实验证实部分视觉编码器对性能贡献极小或负面，冗余现象普遍存在。

Conclusion: 当前多编码器设计存在低效问题，CUR和IG可作为优化多模态架构的诊断工具。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly adopt multiple vision
encoders to capture diverse visual information, ranging from coarse semantics
to fine grained details. While this approach is intended to enhance visual
understanding capability, we observe that the performance gains from adding
encoders often diminish and can even lead to performance degradation, a
phenomenon we term encoder redundancy. This paper presents a systematic
investigation into this issue. Through comprehensive ablation studies on state
of the art multi encoder MLLMs, we empirically demonstrate that significant
redundancy exists. To quantify each encoder's unique contribution, we propose a
principled metric: the Conditional Utilization Rate (CUR). Building on CUR, we
introduce the Information Gap (IG) to capture the overall disparity in encoder
utility within a model.Our experiments reveal that certain vision encoders
contribute little, or even negatively, to overall performance, confirming
substantial redundancy. Our experiments reveal that certain vision encoders
contribute minimally, or even negatively, to the model's performance,
confirming the prevalence of redundancy. These findings highlight critical
inefficiencies in current multi encoder designs and establish that our proposed
metrics can serve as valuable diagnostic tools for developing more efficient
and effective multimodal architectures.

Motivation: 双频PolSAR图像的协作分类面临区域一致性对分类信息学习的影响以及双频数据合理利用的挑战。

Method: 设计了统计动态样本校正（SDSR）模块和双频门控选择蒸馏（DGSD）模块，分别用于优化样本纯度和实现双频数据的互补学习。

Result: 在四个实测双频PolSAR数据集上的实验表明，SKDNet-SSR优于其他相关方法。

Conclusion: SKDNet-SSR有效解决了双频PolSAR图像分类中的关键问题，提升了分类性能。

Abstract: The collaborative classification of dual-frequency PolSAR images is a
meaningful but also challenging research. The effect of regional consistency on
classification information learning and the rational use of dual-frequency data
are two main difficulties for dual-frequency collaborative classification. To
tackle these problems, a selected knowledge distillation network with
statistical-based sample rectification (SKDNet-SSR) is proposed in this
article. First, in addition to applying CNN and ViT as local and global feature
extractors, a statistical-based dynamic sample rectification (SDSR) module is
designed to avoid the impact of poor regional consistency on spatial
information learning process. Specifically, based on the fact that the PolSAR
covariance matrix conforms to the complex Wishart distribution, SDSR first
dynamically evaluates the sample purity, and then performs pixel selection and
pixel generation to remove noisy pixels, thereby avoiding the feature
interaction between informative pixels and noisy pixels and improving the
classification feature extraction process. Next, a dual-frequency gate-selected
distillation (DGSD) module is constructed to emphasize the advantages of
different frequency bands and perform complementary learning on dual-frequency
data. It uses the dominant single-frequency branch on each sample as teacher
model to train the dual-frequency student model, enabling the student model to
learn the optimal results and realizing complementary utilization of
dual-frequency data on different terrain objects. Comprehensive experiments on
four measured dual-frequency PolSAR data demonstrate that the proposed
SKDNet-SSR outperforms other related methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像（T2I）基准测试因提示词敏感性可能导致模型生成能力被低估，并引入偏见。

Method: 基于ConceptMix，引入多模态优化管道，利用视觉语言模型反馈系统优化提示词。

Result: 实验表明优化提示词显著提升生成性能，揭示模型隐藏能力，并发现某些视觉概念（如空间关系和形状）优化效果更显著。

Conclusion: 传统基准测试可能低估模型能力，而ConceptMix++提供了更准确的评估方法。

Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) benchmarks evaluate models on rigid prompts,
potentially underestimating true generative capabilities due to prompt
sensitivity and creating biases that favor certain models while disadvantaging
others. We introduce ConceptMix++, a framework that disentangles prompt
phrasing from visual generation capabilities by applying iterative prompt
optimization. Building on ConceptMix, our approach incorporates a multimodal
optimization pipeline that leverages vision-language model feedback to refine
prompts systematically. Through extensive experiments across multiple diffusion
models, we show that optimized prompts significantly improve compositional
generation performance, revealing previously hidden model capabilities and
enabling fairer comparisons across T2I models. Our analysis reveals that
certain visual concepts -- such as spatial relationships and shapes -- benefit
more from optimization than others, suggesting that existing benchmarks
systematically underestimate model performance in these categories.
Additionally, we find strong cross-model transferability of optimized prompts,
indicating shared preferences for effective prompt phrasing across models.
These findings demonstrate that rigid benchmarking approaches may significantly
underrepresent true model capabilities, while our framework provides more
accurate assessment and insights for future development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器遗忘方法依赖微调，成本高且可能导致性能下降，需要一种更高效且不影响性能的遗忘方法。

Method: 在训练过程中随机将小批量数据分为遗忘集和保留集，优化模型使其无法预测遗忘集，通过撤回密钥实现即时遗忘。

Result: 在多种数据集、架构和分辨率下，{\pname}优于基于微调和无微调的方法。

Conclusion: {\pname}提供了一种高效且性能稳定的机器遗忘解决方案。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MUL) refers to the problem of making a pre-trained model
selectively forget some training instances or class(es) while retaining
performance on the remaining dataset. Existing MUL research involves
fine-tuning using a forget and/or retain set, making it expensive and/or
impractical, and often causing performance degradation in the unlearned model.
We introduce {\pname}, an unlearning-aware vision transformer-based
architecture that can directly perform unlearning for future unlearning
requests without any fine-tuning over the requested set. The proposed model is
trained by simulating unlearning during the training process itself. It
involves randomly separating class(es)/sub-class(es) present in each mini-batch
into two disjoint sets: a proxy forget-set and a retain-set, and the model is
optimized so that it is unable to predict the forget-set. Forgetting is
achieved by withdrawing keys, making unlearning on-the-fly and avoiding
performance degradation. The model is trained jointly with learnable keys and
original weights, ensuring withholding a key irreversibly erases information,
validated by membership inference attack scores. Extensive experiments on
various datasets, architectures, and resolutions confirm {\pname}'s superiority
over both fine-tuning-free and fine-tuning-based methods.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is a fundamental task in computational
chemistry with critical applications in drug discovery and materials science.
While recent works have explored Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task,
they primarily rely on textual molecular representations such as
SMILES/SELFIES, which can be ambiguous and structurally less informative. In
this work, we introduce MolVision, a novel approach that leverages
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by integrating both molecular structure as images
and textual descriptions to enhance property prediction. We construct a
benchmark spanning ten diverse datasets, covering classification, regression
and description tasks. Evaluating nine different VLMs in zero-shot, few-shot,
and fine-tuned settings, we find that visual information improves prediction
performance, particularly when combined with efficient fine-tuning strategies
such as LoRA. Our results reveal that while visual information alone is
insufficient, multimodal fusion significantly enhances generalization across
molecular properties. Adaptation of vision encoder for molecular images in
conjunction with LoRA further improves the performance. The code and data is

Abstract: One practical approach to infer 3D scene structure from a single image is to
retrieve a closely matching 3D model from a database and align it with the
object in the image. Existing methods rely on supervised training with images
and pose annotations, which limits them to a narrow set of object categories.
To address this, we propose a weakly supervised 9-DoF alignment method for
inexact 3D models that requires no pose annotations and generalizes to unseen
categories. Our approach derives a novel feature space based on foundation
features that ensure multi-view consistency and overcome symmetry ambiguities
inherent in foundation features using a self-supervised triplet loss.
Additionally, we introduce a texture-invariant pose refinement technique that
performs dense alignment in normalized object coordinates, estimated through
the enhanced feature space. We conduct extensive evaluations on the real-world
ScanNet25k dataset, where our method outperforms SOTA weakly supervised
baselines by +4.3% mean alignment accuracy and is the only weakly supervised
approach to surpass the supervised ROCA by +2.7%. To assess generalization, we
introduce SUN2CAD, a real-world test set with 20 novel object categories, where
our method achieves SOTA results without prior training on them.

Conclusion: 扩散生成范式在手术阶段识别中有效，CPKD为临床提供了新工具。

Abstract: Gastrointestinal malignancies constitute a leading cause of cancer-related
mortality worldwide, with advanced-stage prognosis remaining particularly
dismal. Originating as a groundbreaking technique for early gastric cancer
treatment, Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection has evolved into a versatile
intervention for diverse gastrointestinal lesions. While computer-assisted
systems significantly enhance procedural precision and safety in ESD, their
clinical adoption faces a critical bottleneck: reliable surgical phase
recognition within complex endoscopic workflows. Current state-of-the-art
approaches predominantly rely on multi-stage refinement architectures that
iteratively optimize temporal predictions. In this paper, we present Clinical
Prior Knowledge-Constrained Diffusion (CPKD), a novel generative framework that
reimagines phase recognition through denoising diffusion principles while
preserving the core iterative refinement philosophy. This architecture
progressively reconstructs phase sequences starting from random noise and
conditioned on visual-temporal features. To better capture three
domain-specific characteristics, including positional priors, boundary
ambiguity, and relation dependency, we design a conditional masking strategy.
Furthermore, we incorporate clinical prior knowledge into the model training to
improve its ability to correct phase logical errors. Comprehensive evaluations
on ESD820, Cholec80, and external multi-center demonstrate that our proposed
CPKD achieves superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art
approaches, validating the effectiveness of diffusion-based generative
paradigms for surgical phase recognition.

Conclusion: SemiOVS能有效利用未标记OOD图像，为半监督语义分割提供新思路，代码已开源。

Abstract: In semi-supervised semantic segmentation, existing studies have shown
promising results in academic settings with controlled splits of benchmark
datasets. However, the potential benefits of leveraging significantly larger
sets of unlabeled images remain unexplored. In real-world scenarios, abundant
unlabeled images are often available from online sources (web-scraped images)
or large-scale datasets. However, these images may have different distributions
from those of the target dataset, a situation known as out-of-distribution
(OOD). Using these images as unlabeled data in semi-supervised learning can
lead to inaccurate pseudo-labels, potentially misguiding network training. In
this paper, we propose a new semi-supervised semantic segmentation framework
with an open-vocabulary segmentation model (SemiOVS) to effectively utilize
unlabeled OOD images. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC and Context datasets
demonstrate two key findings: (1) using additional unlabeled images improves
the performance of semi-supervised learners in scenarios with few labels, and
(2) using the open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) model to pseudo-label OOD
images leads to substantial performance gains. In particular, SemiOVS
outperforms existing PrevMatch and SemiVL methods by +3.5 and +3.0 mIoU,
respectively, on Pascal VOC with a 92-label setting, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. These findings demonstrate that our approach effectively utilizes
abundant unlabeled OOD images for semantic segmentation tasks. We hope this
work can inspire future research and real-world applications. The code is

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) aims to enhance model robustness in unseen or
distributionally shifted target domains through training exclusively on source
domains. Although existing DG techniques, such as data manipulation, learning
strategies, and representation learning, have shown significant progress, they
predominantly address single-modal data. With the emergence of numerous
multi-modal datasets and increasing demand for multi-modal tasks, a key
challenge in Multi-modal Domain Generalization (MMDG) has emerged: enabling
models trained on multi-modal sources to generalize to unseen target
distributions within the same modality set. Due to the inherent differences
between modalities, directly transferring methods from single-modal DG to MMDG
typically yields sub-optimal results. These methods often exhibit randomness
during generalization due to the invisibility of target domains and fail to
consider inter-modal consistency. Applying these methods independently to each
modality in the MMDG setting before combining them can lead to divergent
generalization directions across different modalities, resulting in degraded
generalization capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
approach that leverages Unified Representations to map different paired
modalities together, effectively adapting DG methods to MMDG by enabling
synchronized multi-modal improvements within the unified space. Additionally,
we introduce a supervised disentanglement framework that separates
modal-general and modal-specific information, further enhancing the alignment
of unified representations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets,
including EPIC-Kitchens and Human-Animal-Cartoon, demonstrate the effectiveness
and superiority of our method in enhancing multi-modal domain generalization.

Abstract: Multi-camera systems are increasingly vital in the environmental perception
of autonomous vehicles and robotics. Their physical configuration offers
inherent fixed relative pose constraints that benefit Structure-from-Motion
(SfM). However, traditional global SfM systems struggle with robustness due to
their optimization framework. We propose a novel global motion averaging
framework for multi-camera systems, featuring two core components: a decoupled
rotation averaging module and a hybrid translation averaging module. Our
rotation averaging employs a hierarchical strategy by first estimating relative
rotations within rigid camera units and then computing global rigid unit
rotations. To enhance the robustness of translation averaging, we incorporate
both camera-to-camera and camera-to-point constraints to initialize camera
positions and 3D points with a convex distance-based objective function and
refine them with an unbiased non-bilinear angle-based objective function.
Experiments on large-scale datasets show that our system matches or exceeds
incremental SfM accuracy while significantly improving efficiency. Our
framework outperforms existing global SfM methods, establishing itself as a
robust solution for real-world multi-camera SfM applications. The code is
available at https://github.com/3dv-casia/MGSfM/.

Abstract: Translating nuanced, textually-defined authorial writing styles into
compelling visual representations presents a novel challenge in generative AI.
This paper introduces a pipeline that leverages Author Writing Sheets (AWS) -
structured summaries of an author's literary characteristics - as input to a
Large Language Model (LLM, Claude 3.7 Sonnet). The LLM interprets the AWS to
generate three distinct, descriptive text-to-image prompts, which are then
rendered by a diffusion model (Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium). We evaluated our
approach using 49 author styles from Reddit data, with human evaluators
assessing the stylistic match and visual distinctiveness of the generated
images. Results indicate a good perceived alignment between the generated
visuals and the textual authorial profiles (mean style match: $4.08/5$), with
images rated as moderately distinctive. Qualitative analysis further
highlighted the pipeline's ability to capture mood and atmosphere, while also
identifying challenges in representing highly abstract narrative elements. This
work contributes a novel end-to-end methodology for visual authorial style
personalization and provides an initial empirical validation, opening avenues
for applications in creative assistance and cross-modal understanding.

Abstract: Domain adaptation has become a widely adopted approach in machine learning
due to the high costs associated with labeling data. It is typically applied
when access to a labeled source domain is available. However, in real-world
scenarios, privacy concerns often restrict access to sensitive information,
such as fingerprints, bank account details, and facial images. A promising
solution to this issue is Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA),
which enables domain adaptation without requiring access to labeled target
domain data. Recent research demonstrates that SFUDA can effectively address
domain discrepancies; however, two key challenges remain: (1) the low quality
of prototype samples, and (2) the incorrect assignment of pseudo-labels. To
tackle these challenges, we propose a method consisting of three main phases.
In the first phase, we introduce a Reliable Sample Memory (RSM) module to
improve the quality of prototypes by selecting more representative samples. In
the second phase, we employ a Multi-View Contrastive Learning (MVCL) approach
to enhance pseudo-label quality by leveraging multiple data augmentations. In
the final phase, we apply a noisy label filtering technique to further refine
the pseudo-labels. Our experiments on three benchmark datasets - VisDA 2017,
Office-Home, and Office-31 - demonstrate that our method achieves approximately
2 percent and 6 percent improvements in classification accuracy over the
second-best method and the average of 13 well-known state-of-the-art
approaches, respectively.

TL;DR: MIMO框架通过多模态代理系统和协调循环，显著提升了广告横幅的自动生成质量，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业设计任务（如广告横幅）需要结构化布局、精确排版和品牌一致性，而现有生成模型（如GPT-4o）仅关注视觉保真度，无法满足需求。

Method: MIMO结合了分层多模态代理系统（MIMO-Core）和协调循环（MIMO-Loop），通过自然语言提示和标志图像输入，自动检测并纠正生成中的错误。

Result: 实验表明，MIMO在真实横幅设计场景中显著优于基于扩散和LLM的基线方法。

Conclusion: MIMO为商业设计任务提供了一种高效、自动化的解决方案，弥补了现有生成模型的不足。

Abstract: Recent generative models such as GPT-4o have shown strong capabilities in
producing high-quality images with accurate text rendering. However, commercial
design tasks like advertising banners demand more than visual fidelity -- they
require structured layouts, precise typography, consistent branding, and more.
In this paper, we introduce MIMO (Mirror In-the-Model), an agentic refinement
framework for automatic ad banner generation. MIMO combines a hierarchical
multi-modal agent system (MIMO-Core) with a coordination loop (MIMO-Loop) that
explores multiple stylistic directions and iteratively improves design quality.
Requiring only a simple natural language based prompt and logo image as input,
MIMO automatically detects and corrects multiple types of errors during
generation. Experiments show that MIMO significantly outperforms existing
diffusion and LLM-based baselines in real-world banner design scenarios.

Abstract: To alleviate the reliance of deep neural networks on large-scale datasets,
dataset distillation aims to generate compact, high-quality synthetic datasets
that can achieve comparable performance to the original dataset. The
integration of generative models has significantly advanced this field.
However, existing approaches primarily focus on aligning the distilled dataset
with the original one, often overlooking task-specific information that can be
critical for optimal downstream performance. In this paper, focusing on the
downstream task of classification, we propose a task-specific sampling strategy
for generative dataset distillation that incorporates the concept of difficulty
to consider the requirements of the target task better. The final dataset is
sampled from a larger image pool with a sampling distribution obtained by
matching the difficulty distribution of the original dataset. A logarithmic
transformation is applied as a pre-processing step to correct for
distributional bias. The results of extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method and suggest its potential for enhancing performance
on other downstream tasks.

Abstract: Detecting deepfakes involving face-swaps presents a significant challenge,
particularly in real-world scenarios where anyone can perform face-swapping
with freely available tools and apps without any technical knowledge. Existing
deepfake detection methods rely on facial landmarks or inconsistencies in
pixel-level features and often struggle with face-swap deepfakes, where the
source face is seamlessly blended into the target image or video. The
prevalence of face-swap is evident in everyday life, where it is used to spread
false information, damage reputations, manipulate political opinions, create
non-consensual intimate deepfakes (NCID), and exploit children by enabling the
creation of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Even prominent public figures
are not immune to its impact, with numerous deepfakes of them circulating
widely across social media platforms. Another challenge faced by deepfake
detection methods is the creation of datasets that encompass a wide range of
variations, as training models require substantial amounts of data. This raises
privacy concerns, particularly regarding the processing and storage of personal
facial data, which could lead to unauthorized access or misuse. Our key idea is
to identify these style discrepancies to detect face-swapped images effectively
without accessing the real facial image. We perform comprehensive evaluations
using multiple datasets and face-swapping methods, which showcases the
effectiveness of SafeVision in detecting face-swap deepfakes across diverse
scenarios. SafeVision offers a reliable and scalable solution for detecting
face-swaps in a privacy preserving manner, making it particularly effective in
challenging real-world applications. To the best of our knowledge, SafeVision
is the first deepfake detection using style features while providing inherent
privacy protection.

TL;DR: DESign框架通过动态上下文感知卷积（DCAC）和子网正则化CTC（SR-CTC）提升连续手语识别（CSLR）性能，解决了现有方法在多样本处理和时空动态建模上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CSLR方法难以处理多样本，且动态卷积主要关注空间建模，忽略了时间动态和上下文依赖。

Method: 提出DESign框架，结合DCAC动态捕捉帧间运动线索和上下文信息，以及SR-CTC通过子网监督防止CTC过拟合。

Result: 在PHOENIX14、PHOENIX14-T和CSL-Daily数据集上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: DESign通过DCAC和SR-CTC有效提升了CSLR的泛化能力和识别精度，且SR-CTC无需额外推理开销。

Abstract: Current continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) methods struggle with
handling diverse samples. Although dynamic convolutions are ideal for this
task, they mainly focus on spatial modeling and fail to capture the temporal
dynamics and contextual dependencies. To address this, we propose DESign, a
novel framework that incorporates Dynamic Context-Aware Convolution (DCAC) and
Subnet Regularization Connectionist Temporal Classification (SR-CTC). DCAC
dynamically captures the inter-frame motion cues that constitute signs and
uniquely adapts convolutional weights in a fine-grained manner based on
contextual information, enabling the model to better generalize across diverse
signing behaviors and boost recognition accuracy. Furthermore, we observe that
existing methods still rely on only a limited number of frames for parameter
updates during training, indicating that CTC learning overfits to a dominant
path. To address this, SR-CTC regularizes training by applying supervision to
subnetworks, encouraging the model to explore diverse CTC alignment paths and
effectively preventing overfitting. A classifier-sharing strategy in SR-CTC
further strengthens multi-scale consistency. Notably, SR-CTC introduces no
inference overhead and can be seamlessly integrated into existing CSLR models
to boost performance. Extensive ablations and visualizations further validate
the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Results on mainstream CSLR datasets
(i.e., PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14-T, CSL-Daily) demonstrate that DESign achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

Result: 优化后的简单模型在六个数据集上达到或超越现有最优性能。

Conclusion: 基础设计选择的优化对性能提升至关重要，为未来方法提供了指导。

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection aims to localize semantic changes between
images of the same location captured at different times. In the past few years,
newer methods have attributed enhanced performance to the additions of new and
complex components to existing architectures. Most fail to measure the
performance contribution of fundamental design choices such as backbone
selection, pre-training strategies, and training configurations. We claim that
such fundamental design choices often improve performance even more
significantly than the addition of new architectural components. Due to that,
we systematically revisit the design space of change detection models and
analyse the full potential of a well-optimised baseline. We identify a set of
fundamental design choices that benefit both new and existing architectures.
Leveraging this insight, we demonstrate that when carefully designed, even an
architecturally simple model can match or surpass state-of-the-art performance
on six challenging change detection datasets. Our best practices generalise
beyond our architecture and also offer performance improvements when applied to
related methods, indicating that the space of fundamental design choices has
been underexplored. Our guidelines and architecture provide a strong foundation
for future methods, emphasizing that optimizing core components is just as
important as architectural novelty in advancing change detection performance.

Result: MRC-DETR显著提升了检测效率和精度，并填补了公共数据集的空白。

Conclusion: MRC-DETR为PCB缺陷检测提供了一种高效、准确的解决方案，并推动了该领域的研究。

Abstract: In modern electronic manufacturing, defect detection on Printed Circuit
Boards (PCBs) plays a critical role in ensuring product yield and maintaining
the reliability of downstream assembly processes. However, existing methods
often suffer from limited feature representation, computational redundancy, and
insufficient availability of high-quality training data -- challenges that
hinder their ability to meet industrial demands for both accuracy and
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose MRC-DETR, a novel and
efficient detection framework tailored for bare PCB defect inspection, built
upon the foundation of RT-DETR. Firstly, to enhance feature representation
capability, we design a Multi-Residual Directional Coupled Block (MRDCB). This
module improves channel-wise feature interaction through a multi-residual
structure. Moreover, a cross-spatial learning strategy is integrated to capture
fine-grained pixel-level relationships, further enriching the representational
power of the extracted features. Secondly, to reduce computational redundancy
caused by inefficient cross-layer information fusion, we introduce an Adaptive
Screening Pyramid Network (ASPN). This component dynamically filters and
aggregates salient low-level features, selectively fusing them with high-level
semantic features. By focusing on informative regions and suppressing redundant
computations, ASPN significantly improves both efficiency and detection
accuracy. Finally, to tackle the issue of insufficient training data,
particularly in the context of bare PCBs, we construct a new, high-quality
dataset that fills a critical gap in current public resources. Our dataset not
only supports the training and evaluation of our proposed framework but also
serves as a valuable benchmark for future research in this domain.

Conclusion: MTID通过增强视觉监督和优化动作生成空间，显著提升了动作序列生成的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of procedure planning in
instructional videos, aiming to generate coherent and task-aligned action
sequences from start and end visual observations. Previous work has mainly
relied on text-level supervision to bridge the gap between observed states and
unobserved actions, but it struggles with capturing intricate temporal
relationships among actions. Building on these efforts, we propose the Masked
Temporal Interpolation Diffusion (MTID) model that introduces a latent space
temporal interpolation module within the diffusion model. This module leverages
a learnable interpolation matrix to generate intermediate latent features,
thereby augmenting visual supervision with richer mid-state details. By
integrating this enriched supervision into the model, we enable end-to-end
training tailored to task-specific requirements, significantly enhancing the
model's capacity to predict temporally coherent action sequences. Additionally,
we introduce an action-aware mask projection mechanism to restrict the action
generation space, combined with a task-adaptive masked proximity loss to
prioritize more accurate reasoning results close to the given start and end
states over those in intermediate steps. Simultaneously, it filters out
task-irrelevant action predictions, leading to contextually aware action
sequences. Experimental results across three widely used benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our MTID achieves promising action planning performance on
most metrics. The code is available at https://github.com/WiserZhou/MTID.

Abstract: Estimating normals for noisy point clouds is a persistent challenge in 3D
geometry processing, particularly for end-to-end oriented normal estimation.
Existing methods generally address relatively clean data and rely on supervised
priors to fit local surfaces within specific neighborhoods. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach for learning normals from noisy point clouds through
local gradient-aware surface filtering. Our method projects noisy points onto
the underlying surface by utilizing normals and distances derived from an
implicit function constrained by local gradients. We start by introducing a
distance measurement operator for global surface fitting on noisy data, which
integrates projected distances along normals. Following this, we develop an
implicit field-based filtering approach for surface point construction, adding
projection constraints on these points during filtering. To address issues of
over-smoothing and gradient degradation, we further incorporate local gradient
consistency constraints, as well as local gradient orientation and aggregation.
Comprehensive experiments on normal estimation, surface reconstruction, and
point cloud denoising demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our
method. The source code and trained models are available at

Result: Pose-Star实现了解剖感知、姿势鲁棒的编辑，为工业时尚图像编辑奠定基础。

Conclusion: 该工作填补了可控基准与开放世界需求之间的空白，推动了时尚图像编辑的发展。

Abstract: To advance real-world fashion image editing, we analyze existing two-stage
pipelines(mask generation followed by diffusion-based editing)which overly
prioritize generator optimization while neglecting mask controllability. This
results in two critical limitations: I) poor user-defined flexibility
(coarse-grained human masks restrict edits to predefined regions like upper
torso; fine-grained clothes masks preserve poses but forbid style/length
customization). II) weak pose robustness (mask generators fail due to
articulated poses and miss rare regions like waist, while human parsers remain
limited by predefined categories). To address these gaps, we propose Pose-Star,
a framework that dynamically recomposes body structures (e.g., neck, chest,
etc.) into anatomy-aware masks (e.g., chest-length) for user-defined edits. In
Pose-Star, we calibrate diffusion-derived attention (Star tokens) via skeletal
keypoints to enhance rare structure localization in complex poses, suppress
noise through phase-aware analysis of attention dynamics
(Convergence,Stabilization,Divergence) with threshold masking and
sliding-window fusion, and refine edges via cross-self attention merging and
Canny alignment. This work bridges controlled benchmarks and open-world
demands, pioneering anatomy-aware, pose-robust editing and laying the
foundation for industrial fashion image editing.

Result: 实验表明，REAL显著提升了现有样本修正模型的性能。

Conclusion: 低熵先验为对抗鲁棒性提供了通用指导，REAL方法通过两阶段优化有效提升了防御能力。

Abstract: Existing defense methods fail to defend against unknown attacks and thus
raise generalization issue of adversarial robustness. To remedy this problem,
we attempt to delve into some underlying common characteristics among various
attacks for generality. In this work, we reveal the commonly overlooked low
entropy prior (LE) implied in various adversarial samples, and shed light on
the universal robustness against unseen attacks in inference phase. LE prior is
elaborated as two properties across various attacks as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig.
2: 1) low entropy misclassification for adversarial samples and 2) lower
entropy prediction for higher attack intensity. This phenomenon stands in stark
contrast to the naturally distributed samples. The LE prior can instruct
existing test-time defense methods, thus we propose a two-stage REAL approach:
Rectify Adversarial sample based on LE prior for test-time adversarial
rectification. Specifically, to align adversarial samples more closely with
clean samples, we propose to first rectify adversarial samples misclassified
with low entropy by reverse maximizing prediction entropy, thereby eliminating
their adversarial nature. To ensure the rectified samples can be correctly
classified with low entropy, we carry out secondary rectification by forward
minimizing prediction entropy, thus creating a Max-Min entropy optimization
scheme. Further, based on the second property, we propose an attack-aware
weighting mechanism to adaptively adjust the strengths of Max-Min entropy
objectives. Experiments on several datasets show that REAL can greatly improve
the performance of existing sample rectification models.

Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型数据规模的扩大，噪声对应样本（NC）对模型性能产生负面影响，现有方法难以满足实际需求。

Method: 提出NCU框架，通过最优传输目标学习最难的负信息，统一消除假阳性和假阴性样本的影响。

Result: 在CLIP模型上验证，NCU在零样本迁移任务中表现优于现有方法，且计算开销更低。

Conclusion: NCU为预训练VLM提供了一种高效的去噪方法，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: The data appetite for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has continuously scaled
up from the early millions to billions today, which faces an untenable
trade-off with data quality and inevitably introduces Noisy Correspondence (NC)
samples. Undoubtedly, such semantically unrelated data significantly impairs
the performance of VLMs. Previous efforts mainly address this challenge by
estimating refined alignment for more precise guidance. However, such
resource-intensive pipelines that train VLMs from scratch struggle to meet
realistic data demands. In this paper, we present a brand new perspective that
seeks to directly eliminate the harmful effects of NC in pre-trained VLMs.
Specifically, we propose NCU, a Noisy Correspondence Unlearning fine-tuning
framework that efficiently enhances VLMs' robustness by forgetting learned
noisy knowledge. The key to NCU is learning the hardest negative information,
which can provide explicit unlearning direction for both false positives and
false negatives. Such twin goals unlearning process can be formalized into one
unified optimal transport objective for fast fine-tuning. We validate our
approach with the prevailing CLIP model over various downstream tasks.
Remarkably, NCU surpasses the robust pre-trained method on zero-shot transfer
while with lower computational overhead. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

Abstract: Robots and autonomous vehicles should be aware of what happens in their

reliable path planning, including collision avoidance. We investigate this
estimation task for vehicles using radar sensing. We address moving instance
tracking in sparse radar point clouds to enhance scene interpretation. We
propose a learning-based radar tracker incorporating temporal offset
predictions to enable direct center-based association and enhance segmentation
performance by including additional motion cues. We implement attention-based
tracking for sparse radar scans to include appearance features and enhance
performance. The final association combines geometric and appearance features
to overcome the limitations of center-based tracking to associate instances
reliably. Our approach shows an improved performance on the moving instance
tracking benchmark of the RadarScenes dataset compared to the current state of
the art.

Result: 在零样本、少样本和测试时适应设置下，D&D方法表现出色。

Conclusion: 提出的方法简单有效，能显著提升CLIP对局部细节的处理能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP achieve cross-modal semantic
alignment through contrastive learning, exhibiting robust zero-shot
generalization. Traditional prompt engineering, however, predominantly relies
on coarse-grained category labels, neglecting fine-grained local semantics.
Existing approaches assume that VLMs inherently recognize localized visual
details and attempt to enhance classification by augmenting text prompts with
attribute descriptors generated by large language models. However, our
systematic experiments reveal critical limitations: CLIP's strong bias toward
global image patterns hinders its ability to process localized visual
descriptors. To address this fundamental constraint, we propose a simple,
effective, and plug-and-play solution that enables CLIP to ``See Both the
Forest and the Trees." Specifically, we employ stochastic multi-crop
augmentation to activate CLIP's latent capacity for localized feature analysis.
By cropping only partial regions, the approach effectively constrains the
model's receptive field and recalibrates its attention mechanism, thereby
mitigating its inherent bias. We evaluate the proposed method under zero-shot,
few-shot, and test-time adaptation settings, and extensive experiments
demonstrate that D&D achieves promising performance.

Result: 方法在RadarScenes数据集上表现优异，速度快于传感器帧率，仅需单次扫描数据。

Abstract: The awareness about moving objects in the surroundings of a self-driving
vehicle is essential for safe and reliable autonomous navigation. The
interpretation of LiDAR and camera data achieves exceptional results but
typically requires to accumulate and process temporal sequences of data in
order to extract motion information. In contrast, radar sensors, which are
already installed in most recent vehicles, can overcome this limitation as they
directly provide the Doppler velocity of the detections and, hence incorporate
instantaneous motion information within a single measurement. % In this paper,
we tackle the problem of moving object segmentation in noisy radar point
clouds. We also consider differentiating parked from moving cars, to enhance
scene understanding. Instead of exploiting temporal dependencies to identify
moving objects, we develop a novel transformer-based approach to perform
single-scan moving object segmentation in sparse radar scans accurately. The
key to our Radar Velocity Transformer is to incorporate the valuable velocity
information throughout each module of the network, thereby enabling the precise
segmentation of moving and non-moving objects. Additionally, we propose a
transformer-based upsampling, which enhances the performance by adaptively
combining information and overcoming the limitation of interpolation of sparse
point clouds. Finally, we create a new radar moving object segmentation
benchmark based on the RadarScenes dataset and compare our approach to other
state-of-the-art methods. Our network runs faster than the frame rate of the
sensor and shows superior segmentation results using only single-scan radar
data.

Conclusion: BiCD为二值神经网络在变化检测领域设定了新标准，性能达到最优。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Binarized Change Detection (BiCD), the first binary
neural network (BNN) designed specifically for change detection. Conventional
network binarization approaches, which directly quantize both weights and
activations in change detection models, severely limit the network's ability to
represent input data and distinguish between changed and unchanged regions.
This results in significantly lower detection accuracy compared to real-valued
networks. To overcome these challenges, BiCD enhances both the representational
power and feature separability of BNNs, improving detection performance.
Specifically, we introduce an auxiliary objective based on the Information
Bottleneck (IB) principle, guiding the encoder to retain essential input
information while promoting better feature discrimination. Since directly
computing mutual information under the IB principle is intractable, we design a
compact, learnable auxiliary module as an approximation target, leading to a
simple yet effective optimization strategy that minimizes both reconstruction
loss and standard change detection loss. Extensive experiments on street-view
and remote sensing datasets demonstrate that BiCD establishes a new benchmark
for BNN-based change detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance in this
domain.

*Namho Kim,Junhwa Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态框架，融合视频、图像和文本表示，通过GRU序列编码器和跨模态注意力机制提升细粒度视频分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细粒度视频分类需要理解复杂的时空和语义线索，单一模态难以胜任。

Method: 使用GRU序列编码器和跨模态注意力机制融合多模态数据，结合分类或回归损失训练，并通过特征增强和自编码技术正则化。

Result: 在两个挑战性基准测试（DVD和Aff-Wild2）上显著优于单模态基线，跨注意力和特征增强对鲁棒性和性能贡献显著。

Conclusion: 多模态融合策略在细粒度视频分类任务中表现出色，跨模态注意力和特征增强是关键因素。

Abstract: Fine-grained video classification requires understanding complex
spatio-temporal and semantic cues that often exceed the capacity of a single
modality. In this paper, we propose a multimodal framework that fuses video,
image, and text representations using GRU-based sequence encoders and
cross-modal attention mechanisms. The model is trained using a combination of
classification or regression loss, depending on the task, and is further
regularized through feature-level augmentation and autoencoding techniques. To
evaluate the generality of our framework, we conduct experiments on two
challenging benchmarks: the DVD dataset for real-world violence detection and
the Aff-Wild2 dataset for valence-arousal estimation. Our results demonstrate
that the proposed fusion strategy significantly outperforms unimodal baselines,
with cross-attention and feature augmentation contributing notably to
robustness and performance.

Result: 现有模型在PhenoCell上表现较差（F1分数低至0.20），表明任务更具挑战性。

Conclusion: PhenoCell为未来基础模型和监督模型的评估提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Digital pathology has seen the advent of a wealth of foundational models
(FM), yet to date their performance on cell phenotyping has not been
benchmarked in a unified manner. We therefore propose PhenoBench: A
comprehensive benchmark for cell phenotyping on Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)
stained histopathology images. We provide both PhenoCell, a new H&E dataset
featuring 14 granular cell types identified by using multiplexed imaging, and
ready-to-use fine-tuning and benchmarking code that allows the systematic
evaluation of multiple prominent pathology FMs in terms of dense cell phenotype
predictions in different generalization scenarios. We perform extensive
benchmarking of existing FMs, providing insights into their generalization
behavior under technical vs. medical domain shifts. Furthermore, while FMs
achieve macro F1 scores > 0.70 on previously established benchmarks such as
Lizard and PanNuke, on PhenoCell, we observe scores as low as 0.20. This
indicates a much more challenging task not captured by previous benchmarks,
establishing PhenoCell as a prime asset for future benchmarking of FMs and
supervised models alike. Code and data are available on GitHub.

TL;DR: CLOT提出了一种基于最优传输（OT）的新框架，通过多级循环特征学习机制改进无监督动作分割，解决了ASOT缺乏片段级监督的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASOT虽然通过OT方法实现了动作分割，但缺乏片段级监督，限制了帧与动作表示之间的反馈效果。CLOT旨在通过多级循环学习机制解决这一问题。

Method: CLOT采用编码器-解码器架构，通过解决两个独立的OT问题学习伪标签、帧嵌入和片段嵌入，并通过交叉注意力机制和第三个OT问题优化帧嵌入和伪标签。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，CLOT的循环学习机制显著提升了无监督动作分割的效果。

Conclusion: CLOT通过引入多级循环学习和片段级监督，显著改进了无监督动作分割的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised action segmentation has recently pushed its limits with ASOT, an
optimal transport (OT)-based method that simultaneously learns action
representations and performs clustering using pseudo-labels. Unlike other
OT-based approaches, ASOT makes no assumptions on the action ordering, and it
is able to decode a temporally consistent segmentation from a noisy cost matrix
between video frames and action labels. However, the resulting segmentation
lacks segment-level supervision, which limits the effectiveness of the feedback
between frames and action representations. To address this limitation, we
propose Closed Loop Optimal Transport (CLOT), a novel OT-based framework that
introduces a multi-level cyclic feature learning mechanism. Leveraging its
encoder-decoder architecture, CLOT learns pseudo-labels alongside frame and
segment embeddings by solving two separate OT problems. It then refines both
frame embeddings and pseudo-labels through cross-attention between the learned
frame and segment embeddings, integrating a third OT problem. Experimental
results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the benefits of cyclical
learning for unsupervised action segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文比较了通用基础模型（如CLIP、BLIP等）与领域特定人脸识别模型（如AdaFace、ArcFace）在人脸识别任务中的表现，发现领域特定模型在零样本情况下表现更优，但基础模型在上下文信息丰富时表现提升，且融合两者可提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨通用基础模型与领域特定模型在人脸识别任务中的表现差异，以及如何结合两者提升性能。

Method: 通过实验比较多种基础模型和领域特定模型在多个基准数据集上的表现，并尝试模型融合。

Result: 领域特定模型在零样本情况下表现更优；基础模型在上下文信息丰富时表现提升；融合两者可显著提高准确性。

Conclusion: 结合领域特定模型和通用基础模型能提升人脸识别性能，尤其是在低误匹配率下。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the following question: How do generic foundation
models (e.g., CLIP, BLIP, LLaVa, DINO) compare against a domain-specific face
recognition model (viz., AdaFace or ArcFace) on the face recognition task?
Through a series of experiments involving several foundation models and
benchmark datasets, we are able to report the following findings: (a) In all
datasets considered, domain-specific models outperformed zero-shot foundation
models. (b) The performance of zero-shot generic foundation models improves on
over-segmented face images than tightly cropped faces thereby suggesting the
importance of contextual clues. For example, at a False Match Rate (FMR) of
0.01%, the True Match Rate (TMR) of OpenCLIP improved from 64.97% to 81.73% on
the LFW dataset as the face crop increased from 112x112 to 250x250 while the
TMR of domain-specific AdaFace dropped from 99.09% to 77.31%. (c) A simple
score-level fusion of a foundation model with a domain-specific FR model
improved the accuracy at low FMRs. For example, the TMR of AdaFace when fused
with BLIP improved from 72.64% to 83.31% at an FMR of 0.0001% on the IJB-B
dataset and from 73.17% to 85.81% on the IJB-C dataset. (d) Foundation models,
such as ChatGPT, can be used to impart explainability to the FR pipeline (e.g.,
``Despite minor lighting and head tilt differences, the two left-profile images
show high consistency in forehead slope, nose shape, chin contour...''). In
some instances, foundation models are even able to resolve low-confidence
decisions made by AdaFace (e.g., ``Although AdaFace assigns a low similarity
score of 0.21, both images exhibit visual similarity...and the pair is likely
of the same person''), thereby reiterating the importance of combining
domain-specific FR models with generic foundation models in a judicious manner.

Motivation: 研究文本视觉描述符在视觉概念发现和图像分类中的有效性，探索其与视觉语言模型预训练数据的复杂关系。

Method: 提出两种对齐度量方法（全局对齐和CLIP相似性），评估多种描述符生成方法，从零样本LLM生成到迭代优化的描述符。

Result: 揭示了不同描述符生成策略与基础模型特性的交互关系，提供了超越准确率评估的描述符有效性研究方法。

Conclusion: 对齐度量方法为研究描述符有效性提供了新视角，有助于优化视觉语言模型的应用。

Abstract: Text-based visual descriptors-ranging from simple class names to more
descriptive phrases-are widely used in visual concept discovery and image
classification with vision-language models (VLMs). Their effectiveness,
however, depends on a complex interplay of factors, including semantic clarity,
presence in the VLM's pre-training data, and how well the descriptors serve as
a meaningful representation space. In this work, we systematically analyze
descriptor quality along two key dimensions: (1) representational capacity, and
(2) relationship with VLM pre-training data. We evaluate a spectrum of
descriptor generation methods, from zero-shot LLM-generated prompts to
iteratively refined descriptors. Motivated by ideas from representation
alignment and language understanding, we introduce two alignment-based
metrics-Global Alignment and CLIP Similarity-that move beyond accuracy. These
metrics allow us to shed light on how different descriptor generation
strategies interact with foundation model properties, offering insights into
ways of studying descriptor effectiveness beyond accuracy evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑卒中是全球死亡和长期残疾的主要原因之一，需要快速准确的预测技术。传统诊断方法依赖临床评估，机器学习为改进诊断提供了新途径。

Method: 使用预训练模型（如DenseNet201、MobileNetV2等）进行特征提取，结合BFO、PCA和LDA等特征工程技术，再用SVC、RF等分类器进行分类。

Result: MobileNetV2、LDA和SVC的组合表现最佳，分类准确率为97.93%。

Conclusion: 轻量级预训练模型结合优化和分类技术对脑卒中诊断非常有效。

Abstract: Brain stroke is one of the leading causes of mortality and long-term
disability worldwide, highlighting the need for precise and fast prediction
techniques. Computed Tomography (CT) scan is considered one of the most
effective methods for diagnosing brain strokes. The majority of stroke
classification techniques rely on a single slice-level prediction mechanism,
allowing the radiologist to manually choose the most critical CT slice from the
original CT volume. Although clinical evaluations are often used in traditional
diagnostic procedures, machine learning (ML) has opened up new avenues for
improving stroke diagnosis. To supplement traditional diagnostic techniques,
this study investigates the use of machine learning models, specifically
concerning the prediction of brain stroke at an early stage utilizing CT scan
images. In this research, we proposed a novel approach to brain stroke
detection leveraging machine learning techniques, focusing on optimizing
classification performance with pre-trained deep learning models and advanced
optimization strategies. Pre-trained models, including DenseNet201,
InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, ResNet50, and Xception, are utilized for feature
extraction. Additionally, we employed feature engineering techniques, including
BFO, PCA, and LDA, to enhance models' performance further. These features are
subsequently classified using machine learning algorithms such as SVC, RF, XGB,
DT, LR, KNN, and GNB. Our experiments demonstrate that the combination of
MobileNetV2, LDA, and SVC achieved the highest classification accuracy of
97.93%, significantly outperforming other model-optimizer-classifier
combinations. The results underline the effectiveness of integrating
lightweight pre-trained models with robust optimization and classification
techniques for brain stroke diagnosis.

Result: 所有模型的调整R平方值均高于0.90，指标能准确反映摩擦变化。

Conclusion: 该图像指标在混合设计阶段具有成本效益，能有效预测路面摩擦。

Abstract: Pavement skid resistance is of vital importance for road safety. The
objective of this study is to propose and validate a texture-based image
indicator to predict pavement friction. This index enables pavement friction to
be measured easily and inexpensively using digital images. Three different
types of asphalt surfaces (dense-graded asphalt mix, open-grade friction
course, and chip seal) were evaluated subject to various tire polishing cycles.
Images were taken with corresponding friction measured using Dynamic Friction
Tester (DFT) in the laboratory. The aggregate protrusion area is proposed as
the indicator. Statistical models are established for each asphalt surface type
to correlate the proposed indicator with friction coefficients. The results
show that the adjusted R-square values of all relationships are above 0.90.
Compared to other image-based indicators in the literature, the proposed image
indicator more accurately reflects the changes in pavement friction with the
number of polishing cycles, proving its cost-effective use for considering
pavement friction in mix design stage.

Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆的车载传感器可能被遮挡或视野受限，而路边基础设施感知系统可以提供补充信息，但传统3D检测算法在俯视角下泛化能力不足。

Method: 采用2.5D目标检测框架，检测车辆地面投影为平行四边形，保留平面位置、尺寸和方向，忽略高度。训练数据结合真实和合成场景。

Result: 在未见过的摄像头视角和恶劣天气条件下表现出高检测精度、强泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动驾驶提供了有效的补充感知方案，适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: On-board sensors of autonomous vehicles can be obstructed, occluded, or
limited by restricted fields of view, complicating downstream driving
decisions. Intelligent roadside infrastructure perception systems, installed at
elevated vantage points, can provide wide, unobstructed intersection coverage,
supplying a complementary information stream to autonomous vehicles via
vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. However, conventional 3D
object-detection algorithms struggle to generalize under the domain shift
introduced by top-down perspectives and steep camera angles. We introduce a
2.5D object detection framework, tailored specifically for infrastructure
roadside-mounted cameras. Unlike conventional 2D or 3D object detection, we
employ a prediction approach to detect ground planes of vehicles as
parallelograms in the image frame. The parallelogram preserves the planar
position, size, and orientation of objects while omitting their height, which
is unnecessary for most downstream applications. For training, a mix of
real-world and synthetically generated scenes is leveraged. We evaluate
generalizability on a held-out camera viewpoint and in adverse-weather
scenarios absent from the training set. Our results show high detection
accuracy, strong cross-viewpoint generalization, and robustness to diverse
lighting and weather conditions. Model weights and inference code are provided

Result: 结果表明，ViFMs在多个应用中能取得先进性能，但也揭示了其局限性。

Conclusion: 结论是ViFMs在科学应用中有潜力，但需进一步开发通用性更强的模型。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a proliferation of spatiotemporal foundation
models in different scientific disciplines. While promising, these models are
often domain-specific and are only assessed within the particular applications
for which they are designed. Given that many tasks can be represented as video
modeling problems, video foundation models (ViFMs) hold considerable promise as
general-purpose domain-agnostic approaches. However, it is not known whether
the knowledge acquired on large-scale but potentially out-of-domain data can be
effectively transferred across diverse scientific disciplines, and if a single,
pretrained ViFM can be competitive with domain-specific baselines. To address
this, we introduce SciVid, a comprehensive benchmark comprising five
*Sci*entific *Vid*eo tasks, across medical computer vision, animal behavior,
and weather forecasting. We adapt six leading ViFMs to SciVid using simple
trainable readout modules, establishing strong baselines and demonstrating the
potential for effective transfer learning. Specifically, we show that
state-of-the-art results can be obtained in several applications by leveraging
the general-purpose representations from ViFM backbones. Furthermore, our
results reveal the limitations of existing ViFMs, and highlight opportunities
for the development of generalizable models for high-impact scientific
applications. We release our code at https://github.com/google-deepmind/scivid

Result: 在四个公共数据集上，平均Dice分数提升6.2分，Hausdorff距离减少15.8毫米，仅使用9%可训练参数。

Conclusion: Causal-SAM-LLM为构建鲁棒、高效且可交互控制的医学AI系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: The clinical utility of deep learning models for medical image segmentation
is severely constrained by their inability to generalize to unseen domains.
This failure is often rooted in the models learning spurious correlations
between anatomical content and domain-specific imaging styles. To overcome this
fundamental challenge, we introduce Causal-SAM-LLM, a novel framework that
elevates Large Language Models (LLMs) to the role of causal reasoners. Our
framework, built upon a frozen Segment Anything Model (SAM) encoder,
incorporates two synergistic innovations. First, Linguistic Adversarial
Disentanglement (LAD) employs a Vision-Language Model to generate rich, textual
descriptions of confounding image styles. By training the segmentation model's
features to be contrastively dissimilar to these style descriptions, it learns
a representation robustly purged of non-causal information. Second, Test-Time
Causal Intervention (TCI) provides an interactive mechanism where an LLM
interprets a clinician's natural language command to modulate the segmentation
decoder's features in real-time, enabling targeted error correction. We conduct
an extensive empirical evaluation on a composite benchmark from four public
datasets (BTCV, CHAOS, AMOS, BraTS), assessing generalization under
cross-scanner, cross-modality, and cross-anatomy settings. Causal-SAM-LLM
establishes a new state of the art in out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness,
improving the average Dice score by up to 6.2 points and reducing the Hausdorff
Distance by 15.8 mm over the strongest baseline, all while using less than 9%
of the full model's trainable parameters. Our work charts a new course for
building robust, efficient, and interactively controllable medical AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号分析面临标记数据少、高维度和缺乏可扩展模型的问题，现有自监督方法未能充分捕捉时空依赖性。

Method: 将EEG信号视为类视频序列，利用V-JEPA框架学习联合嵌入和自适应掩码，提取时空特征。

Result: 在TUH异常EEG数据集上分类准确率优于现有方法，并捕捉到生理相关的时空模式。

Conclusion: EEG-VJEPA为临床EEG分析提供了可扩展且可信的框架，支持人机协作诊断。

Abstract: EEG signals capture brain activity with high temporal and low spatial
resolution, supporting applications such as neurological diagnosis, cognitive
monitoring, and brain-computer interfaces. However, effective analysis is
hindered by limited labeled data, high dimensionality, and the absence of
scalable models that fully capture spatiotemporal dependencies. Existing
self-supervised learning (SSL) methods often focus on either spatial or
temporal features, leading to suboptimal representations. To this end, we
propose EEG-VJEPA, a novel adaptation of the Video Joint Embedding Predictive
Architecture (V-JEPA) for EEG classification. By treating EEG as video-like
sequences, EEG-VJEPA learns semantically meaningful spatiotemporal
representations using joint embeddings and adaptive masking. To our knowledge,
this is the first work that exploits V-JEPA for EEG classification and explores
the visual concepts learned by the model. Evaluations on the publicly available
Temple University Hospital (TUH) Abnormal EEG dataset show that EEG-VJEPA
outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in classification accuracy.Beyond
classification accuracy, EEG-VJEPA captures physiologically relevant spatial
and temporal signal patterns, offering interpretable embeddings that may
support human-AI collaboration in diagnostic workflows. These findings position
EEG-VJEPA as a promising framework for scalable, trustworthy EEG analysis in
real-world clinical settings.

Conclusion: ProtoMM通过多模态原型学习和动态更新机制，显著提升了预训练视觉语言模型在测试时的适应性和泛化能力。

Abstract: With the increasing attention to pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs),
\eg, CLIP, substantial efforts have been devoted to many downstream tasks,
especially in test-time adaptation (TTA). However, previous works focus on
learning prototypes only in the textual modality while overlooking the
ambiguous semantics in class names. These ambiguities lead to textual
prototypes that are insufficient to capture visual concepts, resulting in
limited performance. To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{ProtoMM}, a
training-free framework that constructs multimodal prototypes to adapt VLMs
during the test time. By viewing the prototype as a discrete distribution over
the textual descriptions and visual particles, ProtoMM has the ability to
combine the multimodal features for comprehensive prototype learning. More
importantly, the visual particles are dynamically updated as the testing stream
flows. This allows our multimodal prototypes to continually learn from the
data, enhancing their generalizability in unseen scenarios. In addition, we
quantify the importance of the prototypes and test images by formulating their
semantic distance as an optimal transport problem. Extensive experiments on 15
zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a
1.03\% average accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods on ImageNet
and its variant datasets.

Motivation: 探索视觉嵌入模型是否能够通过线性方向捕捉连续有序属性，为图像排名在向量数据库中的应用提供新思路。

Method: 定义“可排名”模型，并在7种流行编码器和9个数据集上测试，验证仅需少量样本（甚至两个极端示例）即可恢复排名轴。

Result: 发现许多嵌入模型天生具有排名能力，且无需大规模监督即可恢复有意义的排名轴。

Conclusion: 研究为图像排名应用提供了新可能性，并推动了对可排名嵌入结构和学习的进一步研究。

Abstract: We study whether visual embedding models capture continuous, ordinal
attributes along linear directions, which we term _rank axes_. We define a
model as _rankable_ for an attribute if projecting embeddings onto such an axis
preserves the attribute's order. Across 7 popular encoders and 9 datasets with
attributes like age, crowd count, head pose, aesthetics, and recency, we find
that many embeddings are inherently rankable. Surprisingly, a small number of
samples, or even just two extreme examples, often suffice to recover meaningful
rank axes, without full-scale supervision. These findings open up new use cases
for image ranking in vector databases and motivate further study into the
structure and learning of rankable embeddings. Our code is available at

Abstract: Recent "segment anything" efforts show promise by learning from large-scale
data, but adapting such models directly to medical images remains challenging
due to the complexity of medical data, noisy annotations, and continual
learning requirements across diverse modalities and anatomical structures. In
this work, we propose SAMed-2, a new foundation model for medical image
segmentation built upon the SAM-2 architecture. Specifically, we introduce a
temporal adapter into the image encoder to capture image correlations and a
confidence-driven memory mechanism to store high-certainty features for later
retrieval. This memory-based strategy counters the pervasive noise in
large-scale medical datasets and mitigates catastrophic forgetting when
encountering new tasks or modalities. To train and evaluate SAMed-2, we curate
MedBank-100k, a comprehensive dataset spanning seven imaging modalities and 21
medical segmentation tasks. Our experiments on both internal benchmarks and 10

*JianHe Low,Ozge Mercanoglu Sincan,Richard Bowden*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于大语言模型（LLMs）的无训练框架，用于提升手语识别中的符号定位质量，解决了词汇不灵活性和连续手语流中的歧义问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决手语翻译中数据稀缺问题，提升符号定位的准确性和灵活性。

Method: 结合全局时空和手形特征，通过动态时间规整和余弦相似度匹配大规模符号词典，并利用LLM进行上下文感知的消歧。

Result: 在合成和真实手语数据集上表现出更高的准确性和句子流畅性。

Conclusion: 展示了LLMs在手语符号定位中的潜力，为无训练框架提供了新思路。

Abstract: Sign spotting, the task of identifying and localizing individual signs within
continuous sign language video, plays a pivotal role in scaling dataset
annotations and addressing the severe data scarcity issue in sign language
translation. While automatic sign spotting holds great promise for enabling
frame-level supervision at scale, it grapples with challenges such as
vocabulary inflexibility and ambiguity inherent in continuous sign streams.
Hence, we introduce a novel, training-free framework that integrates Large
Language Models (LLMs) to significantly enhance sign spotting quality. Our
approach extracts global spatio-temporal and hand shape features, which are
then matched against a large-scale sign dictionary using dynamic time warping
and cosine similarity. This dictionary-based matching inherently offers
superior vocabulary flexibility without requiring model retraining. To mitigate
noise and ambiguity from the matching process, an LLM performs context-aware
gloss disambiguation via beam search, notably without fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world sign language datasets demonstrate
our method's superior accuracy and sentence fluency compared to traditional
approaches, highlighting the potential of LLMs in advancing sign spotting.

*Praveen Jesudhas,Raghuveera T,Shiney Jeyaraj*

TL;DR: 提出了一种非侵入式且计算高效的预跌倒检测系统，利用视频数据和骨骼特征，显著降低计算需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统侵入性强或计算资源需求高，限制了广泛应用。

Method: 使用骨骼数据和LSTM网络，设计简化特征和模型以减少计算成本。

Result: 计算需求降低18倍，准确率达88%。

Conclusion: 系统适合工业和住宅安全领域的广泛应用。

Abstract: Existing pre-impact fall detection systems have high accuracy, however they
are either intrusive to the subject or require heavy computational resources
for fall detection, resulting in prohibitive deployment costs. These factors
limit the global adoption of existing fall detection systems. In this work we
present a Pre-impact fall detection system that is both non-intrusive and
computationally efficient at deployment. Our system utilizes video data of the
locality available through cameras, thereby requiring no specialized equipment
to be worn by the subject. Further, the fall detection system utilizes minimal
fall specific features and simplistic neural network models, designed to reduce
the computational cost of the system. A minimal set of fall specific features
are derived from the skeletal data, post observing the relative position of
human skeleton during fall. These features are shown to have different
distributions for Fall and non-fall scenarios proving their discriminative
capability. A Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based network is selected and the
network architecture and training parameters are designed after evaluation of
performance on standard datasets. In the Pre-impact fall detection system the
computation requirement is about 18 times lesser than existing modules with a
comparable accuracy of 88%. Given the low computation requirements and higher
accuracy levels, the proposed system is suitable for wider adoption in
engineering systems related to industrial and residential safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前GUI代理从依赖文本转向纯视觉方法，但忽视了上下文建模的挑战，如无关元素干扰和历史信息冗余。

Method: 提出了掩码元素剪枝方法减少无关元素干扰，以及一致性引导的历史压缩模块优化历史信息处理。

Result: SimpAgent减少了27%的FLOPs，并在多样化的网络和移动环境中表现出优越的导航性能。

Conclusion: SimpAgent通过高效上下文建模，显著提升了GUI代理的性能和效率，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: The research focus of GUI agents is shifting from text-dependent to
pure-vision-based approaches, which, though promising, prioritize comprehensive
pre-training data collection while neglecting contextual modeling challenges.
We probe the characteristics of element and history contextual modeling in GUI
agent and summarize: 1) the high-density and loose-relation of element context
highlight the existence of many unrelated elements and their negative
influence; 2) the high redundancy of history context reveals the inefficient
history modeling in current GUI agents. In this work, we propose a
context-aware simplification framework for building an efficient and effective
GUI Agent, termed SimpAgent. To mitigate potential interference from numerous
unrelated elements, we introduce a masking-based element pruning method that
circumvents the intractable relation modeling through an efficient masking
mechanism. To reduce the redundancy in historical information, we devise a
consistency-guided history compression module, which enhances implicit
LLM-based compression through innovative explicit guidance, achieving an
optimal balance between performance and efficiency. With the above components,
SimpAgent reduces 27% FLOPs and achieves superior GUI navigation performances.
Comprehensive navigation experiments across diverse web and mobile environments
demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of our agent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS SLAM方法在户外场景中缺乏几何先验或存在尺度漂移问题，限制了其性能。

Method: 提出自一致跟踪模块和基于补丁的动态映射模块，结合3DGS点图避免尺度漂移并引入几何先验。

Result: 在Waymo、KITTI和DL3DV数据集上，S3PO-GS在视图合成和跟踪精度上优于其他方法。

Conclusion: S3PO-GS在复杂户外环境中表现出色，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a popular solution in SLAM due to its
high-fidelity and real-time novel view synthesis performance. However, some
previous 3DGS SLAM methods employ a differentiable rendering pipeline for
tracking, \textbf{lack geometric priors} in outdoor scenes. Other approaches
introduce separate tracking modules, but they accumulate errors with
significant camera movement, leading to \textbf{scale drift}. To address these
challenges, we propose a robust RGB-only outdoor 3DGS SLAM method: S3PO-GS.
Technically, we establish a self-consistent tracking module anchored in the
3DGS pointmap, which avoids cumulative scale drift and achieves more precise
and robust tracking with fewer iterations. Additionally, we design a
patch-based pointmap dynamic mapping module, which introduces geometric priors
while avoiding scale ambiguity. This significantly enhances tracking accuracy
and the quality of scene reconstruction, making it particularly suitable for
complex outdoor environments. Our experiments on the Waymo, KITTI, and DL3DV
datasets demonstrate that S3PO-GS achieves state-of-the-art results in novel
view synthesis and outperforms other 3DGS SLAM methods in tracking accuracy.

TL;DR: FACM通过Flow-Anchoring策略解决CMs训练不稳定的问题，显著提升生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CMs在少步生成中效率高但训练不稳定，原因是模型失去对瞬时速度场的把握。

Method: 提出FACM，利用Flow Matching任务作为CM目标的锚点，无需架构修改。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256上，NFE=2时FID为1.32，NFE=1时为1.76，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FACM为高性能少步生成模型提供了通用有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Continuous-time Consistency Models (CMs) promise efficient few-step
generation but face significant challenges with training instability. We argue
this instability stems from a fundamental conflict: by training a network to
learn only a shortcut across a probability flow, the model loses its grasp on
the instantaneous velocity field that defines the flow. Our solution is to
explicitly anchor the model in the underlying flow during training. We
introduce the Flow-Anchored Consistency Model (FACM), a simple but effective
training strategy that uses a Flow Matching (FM) task as an anchor for the
primary CM shortcut objective. This Flow-Anchoring approach requires no
architectural modifications and is broadly compatible with standard model
architectures. By distilling a pre-trained LightningDiT model, our method
achieves a state-of-the-art FID of 1.32 with two steps (NFE=2) and 1.76 with
just one step (NFE=1) on ImageNet 256x256, significantly outperforming previous
methods. This provides a general and effective recipe for building
high-performance, few-step generative models. Our code and pretrained models:

Result: 在VinDr-CXR数据集上F1得分为0.76，成功定位病灶区域。

Conclusion: ChestGPT可作为辅助工具，减轻放射科医生负担，提升诊断效率。

Abstract: The global demand for radiologists is increasing rapidly due to a growing
reliance on medical imaging services, while the supply of radiologists is not
keeping pace. Advances in computer vision and image processing technologies
present significant potential to address this gap by enhancing radiologists'
capabilities and improving diagnostic accuracy. Large language models (LLMs),
particularly generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs), have become the
primary approach for understanding and generating textual data. In parallel,
vision transformers (ViTs) have proven effective at converting visual data into
a format that LLMs can process efficiently. In this paper, we present ChestGPT,
a deep-learning framework that integrates the EVA ViT with the Llama 2 LLM to
classify diseases and localize regions of interest in chest X-ray images. The
ViT converts X-ray images into tokens, which are then fed, together with
engineered prompts, into the LLM, enabling joint classification and
localization of diseases. This approach incorporates transfer learning
techniques to enhance both explainability and performance. The proposed method
achieved strong global disease classification performance on the VinDr-CXR
dataset, with an F1 score of 0.76, and successfully localized pathologies by
generating bounding boxes around the regions of interest. We also outline
several task-specific prompts, in addition to general-purpose prompts, for
scenarios radiologists might encounter. Overall, this framework offers an
assistive tool that can lighten radiologists' workload by providing preliminary
findings and regions of interest to facilitate their diagnostic process.

Conclusion: StreamDiT为实时视频生成提供了高效解决方案，适用于流媒体、交互式生成等场景。

Abstract: Recently, great progress has been achieved in text-to-video (T2V) generation
by scaling transformer-based diffusion models to billions of parameters, which
can generate high-quality videos. However, existing models typically produce
only short clips offline, restricting their use cases in interactive and
real-time applications. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing
StreamDiT, a streaming video generation model. StreamDiT training is based on
flow matching by adding a moving buffer. We design mixed training with
different partitioning schemes of buffered frames to boost both content
consistency and visual quality. StreamDiT modeling is based on adaLN DiT with
varying time embedding and window attention. To practice the proposed method,
we train a StreamDiT model with 4B parameters. In addition, we propose a
multistep distillation method tailored for StreamDiT. Sampling distillation is
performed in each segment of a chosen partitioning scheme. After distillation,
the total number of function evaluations (NFEs) is reduced to the number of
chunks in a buffer. Finally, our distilled model reaches real-time performance
at 16 FPS on one GPU, which can generate video streams at 512p resolution. We
evaluate our method through both quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Our
model enables real-time applications, e.g. streaming generation, interactive
generation, and video-to-video. We provide video results and more examples in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用事件和帧的互补信息，导致训练复杂且计算成本高。

Method: 采用混合框架，包含SNN分支和ANN分支，并引入ATW Injector、EDS Injector和CSF模块以优化特征融合。

Result: 在多个数据集上达到最优精度，并在DSEC-Semantic数据集上能耗降低65%。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了分割精度和能效，为事件相机应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Event cameras have recently been introduced into image semantic segmentation,
owing to their high temporal resolution and other advantageous properties.
However, existing event-based semantic segmentation methods often fail to fully
exploit the complementary information provided by frames and events, resulting
in complex training strategies and increased computational costs. To address
these challenges, we propose an efficient hybrid framework for image semantic
segmentation, comprising a Spiking Neural Network branch for events and an
Artificial Neural Network branch for frames. Specifically, we introduce three
specialized modules to facilitate the interaction between these two branches:
the Adaptive Temporal Weighting (ATW) Injector, the Event-Driven Sparse (EDS)
Injector, and the Channel Selection Fusion (CSF) module. The ATW Injector
dynamically integrates temporal features from event data into frame features,
enhancing segmentation accuracy by leveraging critical dynamic temporal
information. The EDS Injector effectively combines sparse event data with rich
frame features, ensuring precise temporal and spatial information alignment.
The CSF module selectively merges these features to optimize segmentation
performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework not only
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across the DDD17-Seg, DSEC-Semantic, and
M3ED-Semantic datasets but also significantly reduces energy consumption,
achieving a 65\% reduction on the DSEC-Semantic dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模视觉基础模型（如DINOv2）依赖庞大架构和数据集，但实际应用中需要高效复现预训练方案。

Method: 采用频率过滤课程（低频优先）和高斯噪声补丁增强，应用于ViT-B/16架构。

Result: 预训练时间和FLOPs分别减少1.6倍和2.25倍，在ImageNet-C上保持鲁棒性，线性探测性能与基线相当。

Conclusion: 该方法在效率和鲁棒性上取得双重优势，为大规模自监督基础模型提供了更可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale vision foundation models such as DINOv2 boast impressive
performances by leveraging massive architectures and training datasets. But
numerous scenarios require practitioners to reproduce those pre-training
solutions, such as on private data, new modalities, or simply for scientific
questioning--which is currently extremely demanding computation-wise. We thus
propose a novel pre-training strategy for DINOv2 that simultaneously
accelerates convergence--and strengthens robustness to common corruptions as a
by-product. Our approach involves a frequency filtering
curriculum--low-frequency being seen first--and the Gaussian noise patching
augmentation. Applied to a ViT-B/16 backbone trained on ImageNet-1K, while
pre-training time and FLOPs are reduced by 1.6x and 2.25x, our method still
achieves matching robustness in corruption benchmarks (ImageNet-C) and
maintains competitive linear probing performance compared with baseline. This
dual benefit of efficiency and robustness makes large-scale self-supervised
foundation modeling more attainable, while opening the door to novel
exploration around data curriculum and augmentation as means to improve
self-supervised learning models robustness. The code is available at

Result: 该方法显著提升了ViT模型对位翻转故障的鲁棒性，可靠性提高了三个数量级。

Conclusion: 该技术为零开销的容错解决方案，适用于关键应用中的ViT模型。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated superior performance over
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in various vision-related tasks such as
classification, object detection, and segmentation due to their use of
self-attention mechanisms. As ViTs become more popular in safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, ensuring their correct functionality
becomes essential, especially in the presence of bit-flip faults in their
parameters stored in memory. In this paper, a fault tolerance technique is
introduced to protect ViT parameters against bit-flip faults with zero memory
overhead. Since the least significant bits of parameters are not critical for
model accuracy, replacing the LSB with a parity bit provides an error detection
mechanism without imposing any overhead on the model. When faults are detected,
affected parameters are masked by zeroing out, as most parameters in ViT models
are near zero, effectively preventing accuracy degradation. This approach
enhances reliability across ViT models, improving the robustness of parameters
to bit-flips by up to three orders of magnitude, making it an effective
zero-overhead solution for fault tolerance in critical applications.

Motivation: 现有VPR方法通常在单一数据集上训练，导致泛化能力受限；多数据集联合训练虽有望解决此问题，但数据集间的差异会限制特征聚合层的信息容量。

Method: 提出QAA技术，利用学习到的查询作为参考码本，通过计算跨查询相似性（CS）生成鲁棒描述符。

Result: QAA在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，实现了泛化与性能的平衡。

Conclusion: QAA通过增强信息容量，为通用VPR模型提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning methods for Visual Place Recognition (VPR) have advanced
significantly, largely driven by large-scale datasets. However, most existing
approaches are trained on a single dataset, which can introduce
dataset-specific inductive biases and limit model generalization. While
multi-dataset joint training offers a promising solution for developing
universal VPR models, divergences among training datasets can saturate limited
information capacity in feature aggregation layers, leading to suboptimal
performance. To address these challenges, we propose Query-based Adaptive
Aggregation (QAA), a novel feature aggregation technique that leverages learned
queries as reference codebooks to effectively enhance information capacity
without significant computational or parameter complexity. We show that
computing the Cross-query Similarity (CS) between query-level image features
and reference codebooks provides a simple yet effective way to generate robust
descriptors. Our results demonstrate that QAA outperforms state-of-the-art
models, achieving balanced generalization across diverse datasets while
maintaining peak performance comparable to dataset-specific models. Ablation
studies further explore QAA's mechanisms and scalability. Visualizations reveal
that the learned queries exhibit diverse attention patterns across datasets.
Code will be publicly released.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models generate images by iteratively denoising
random noise, conditioned on a prompt. While these models have enabled
impressive progress in image generation, they often fail to accurately reflect
all semantic information described in the prompt -- failures that are difficult
to detect automatically. In this work, we introduce a diffusion model
architecture built with B-cos modules that offers inherent interpretability.
Our approach provides insight into how individual prompt tokens affect the

influenced by each token. We demonstrate that B-cos diffusion models can
produce high-quality images while providing meaningful insights into

Conclusion: ArmGS能够有效建模全局场景外观变化和局部细粒度变化，为自动驾驶场景建模提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: This work focuses on modeling dynamic urban environments for autonomous
driving simulation. Contemporary data-driven methods using neural radiance
fields have achieved photorealistic driving scene modeling, but they suffer
from low rendering efficacy. Recently, some approaches have explored 3D
Gaussian splatting for modeling dynamic urban scenes, enabling high-fidelity
reconstruction and real-time rendering. However, these approaches often neglect
to model fine-grained variations between frames and camera viewpoints, leading
to suboptimal results. In this work, we propose a new approach named ArmGS that
exploits composite driving Gaussian splatting with multi-granularity appearance
refinement for autonomous driving scene modeling. The core idea of our approach
is devising a multi-level appearance modeling scheme to optimize a set of
transformation parameters for composite Gaussian refinement from multiple
granularities, ranging from local Gaussian level to global image level and
dynamic actor level. This not only models global scene appearance variations
between frames and camera viewpoints, but also models local fine-grained
changes of background and objects. Extensive experiments on multiple
challenging autonomous driving datasets, namely, Waymo, KITTI, NOTR and
VKITTI2, demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art
methods.

Motivation: 现有去雾方法主要关注短距离场景，长距离去雾因信号损失严重而未被充分研究。近红外模态具有更好的雾穿透能力，但现有方法常忽略可见光图像中的雾残留。

Method: HSVF框架包含语义流和视觉流：语义流通过模态不变表示重建无雾场景，视觉流从近红外模态恢复结构细节。

Result: 实验表明，HSVF在真实长距离去雾任务中优于现有方法，生成高对比度和丰富纹理的结果。

Conclusion: HSVF通过双流协作有效解决了长距离去雾问题，并提供了新的数据集支持研究。

Abstract: While image dehazing has advanced substantially in the past decade, most
efforts have focused on short-range scenarios, leaving long-range haze removal
under-explored. As distance increases, intensified scattering leads to severe
haze and signal loss, making it impractical to recover distant details solely
from visible images. Near-infrared, with superior fog penetration, offers
critical complementary cues through multimodal fusion. However, existing
methods focus on content integration while often neglecting haze embedded in
visible images, leading to results with residual haze. In this work, we argue
that the infrared and visible modalities not only provide complementary
low-level visual features, but also share high-level semantic consistency.
Motivated by this, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Fusion (HSVF)
framework, comprising a semantic stream to reconstruct haze-free scenes and a
visual stream to incorporate structural details from the near-infrared
modality. The semantic stream first acquires haze-robust semantic prediction by
aligning modality-invariant intrinsic representations. Then the shared
semantics act as strong priors to restore clear and high-contrast distant
scenes under severe haze degradation. In parallel, the visual stream focuses on
recovering lost structural details from near-infrared by fusing complementary
cues from both visible and near-infrared images. Through the cooperation of
dual streams, HSVF produces results that exhibit both high-contrast scenes and
rich texture details. Moreover, we introduce a novel pixel-aligned
visible-infrared haze dataset with semantic labels to facilitate benchmarking.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over
state-of-the-art approaches in real-world long-range haze removal.

Abstract: Recently, domain generalization (DG) has emerged as a promising solution to
mitigate distribution-shift issue in sensor-based human activity recognition
(HAR) scenario. However, most existing DG-based works have merely focused on
modeling statistical dependence between sensor data and activity labels,
neglecting the importance of intrinsic casual mechanism. Intuitively, every
sensor input can be viewed as a mixture of causal (category-aware) and
non-causal factors (domain-specific), where only the former affects activity
classification judgment. In this paper, by casting such DG-based HAR as a
casual inference problem, we propose a causality-inspired representation
learning algorithm for cross-domain activity recognition. To this end, an
early-forking two-branch framework is designed, where two separate branches are
respectively responsible for learning casual and non-causal features, while an
independence-based Hilbert-Schmidt Information Criterion is employed to
implicitly disentangling them. Additionally, an inhomogeneous domain sampling
strategy is designed to enhance disentanglement, while a category-aware domain
perturbation layer is performed to prevent representation collapse. Extensive
experiments on several public HAR benchmarks demonstrate that our
causality-inspired approach significantly outperforms eleven related
state-of-the-art baselines under cross-person, cross-dataset, and
cross-position settings. Detailed ablation and visualizations analyses reveal
underlying casual mechanism, indicating its effectiveness, efficiency, and
universality in cross-domain activity recognition scenario.

Motivation: 现有基于重建的方法在处理高精度点云时面临规模和结构复杂性的挑战。

Method: DUS-Net通过噪声生成模块增强数据多样性，利用下采样网络学习无异常中心点云，再通过上采样网络重建高精度点云。

Result: 在Real3D-AD和Anomaly-ShapeNet数据集上分别达到79.9%和79.5%的对象级AUROC，以及71.2%和84.7%的点级AUROC。

Conclusion: DUS-Net通过保留几何结构，实现了高精度点云重建，并在3D异常检测中取得SOTA性能。

Abstract: Reconstruction-based methods have demonstrated very promising results for 3D
anomaly detection. However, these methods face great challenges in handling
high-precision point clouds due to the large scale and complex structure. In
this study, a Down-Up Sampling Network (DUS-Net) is proposed to reconstruct
high-precision point clouds for 3D anomaly detection by preserving the group
center geometric structure. The DUS-Net first introduces a Noise Generation
module to generate noisy patches, which facilitates the diversity of training
data and strengthens the feature representation for reconstruction. Then, a
Down-sampling Network~(Down-Net) is developed to learn an anomaly-free center
point cloud from patches with noise injection. Subsequently, an Up-sampling
Network (Up-Net) is designed to reconstruct high-precision point clouds by
fusing multi-scale up-sampling features. Our method leverages group centers for
construction, enabling the preservation of geometric structure and providing a
more precise point cloud. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with an
Object-level AUROC of 79.9% and 79.5%, and a Point-level AUROC of 71.2% and
84.7% on the Real3D-AD and Anomaly-ShapeNet datasets, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人类动画模型计算成本高且任务专用性强，缺乏统一解决方案，亟需高效、高质量、通用性强的模型。

Method: 采用多任务范式将不同任务视为空间-时间局部重建，引入多模态解耦交叉注意力模块，并提出SFT+Reward交替训练范式。

Result: EchoMimicV3在1.3B参数下达到与10倍参数模型相当的生成质量，在面部和半身视频生成中表现优异。

Conclusion: EchoMimicV3为高效、高质量、多任务合一的人类动画生成提供了解决方案，解决了性能和实用性问题。

Abstract: Human animation recently has advanced rapidly, achieving increasingly
realistic and vivid results, especially with the integration of large-scale
video generation models. However, the slow inference speed and high
computational cost of these large models bring significant challenges for
practical applications. Additionally, various tasks in human animation, such as
lip-syncing, audio-driven full-body animation, and video generation from start
and end frames, often require different specialized models. The introduction of
large video models has not alleviated this dilemma. This raises an important
question: Can we make human animation Faster, Higher in quality, Stronger in
generalization, and make various tasks Together in one model? To address this,
we dive into video generation models and discover that the devil lies in the
details: Inspired by MAE, we propose a novel unified Multi-Task paradigm for
human animation, treating diverse generation tasks as spatial-temporal local
reconstructions, requiring modifications only on the input side; Given the
interplay and division among multi-modal conditions including text, image, and
audio, we introduce a multi-modal decoupled cross-attention module to fuse
multi-modals in a divide-and-conquer manner; We propose a new SFT+Reward
alternating training paradigm, enabling the minimal model with 1.3B parameters
to achieve generation quality comparable to models with 10 times the parameters
count. Through these innovations, our work paves the way for efficient,
high-quality, and versatile digital human generation, addressing both
performance and practicality challenges in the field. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EchoMimicV3 outperforms existing models in both facial and
semi-body video generation, providing precise text-based control for creating
videos in a wide range of scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OTDRG框架利用最优传输（OT）对齐图像特征与疾病标签，解决了通用大语言模型（LLMs）在放射学报告生成中临床效果不足的问题，实现了语言流畅性和临床准确性的双重提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用LLMs在放射学报告生成中过于注重语言流畅性而忽视临床有效性，且难以捕捉图像与文本的关系，导致临床实用性差。

Method: 提出OTDRG框架，通过OT对齐图像特征与疾病标签，结合对齐与微调（Alignment & Fine-Tuning）优化跨模态关系，并设计疾病预测模块辅助验证。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR和IU X-Ray数据集上，OTDRG在自然语言生成（NLG）和临床疗效（CE）指标上均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: OTDRG通过跨模态对齐和微调，显著提升了放射学报告的临床实用性和语言质量。

Abstract: Radiology report generation represents a significant application within
medical AI, and has achieved impressive results. Concurrently, large language
models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains.
However, empirical validation indicates that general LLMs tend to focus more on
linguistic fluency rather than clinical effectiveness, and lack the ability to
effectively capture the relationship between X-ray images and their
corresponding texts, thus resulting in poor clinical practicability. To address
these challenges, we propose Optimal Transport-Driven Radiology Report
Generation (OTDRG), a novel framework that leverages Optimal Transport (OT) to
align image features with disease labels extracted from reports, effectively
bridging the cross-modal gap. The core component of OTDRG is Alignment \&
Fine-Tuning, where OT utilizes results from the encoding of label features and
image visual features to minimize cross-modal distances, then integrating image
and text features for LLMs fine-tuning. Additionally, we design a novel disease
prediction module to predict disease labels contained in X-ray images during
validation and testing. Evaluated on the MIMIC-CXR and IU X-Ray datasets, OTDRG
achieves state-of-the-art performance in both natural language generation (NLG)
and clinical efficacy (CE) metrics, delivering reports that are not only
linguistically coherent but also clinically accurate.

Abstract: Accurate gland segmentation in histopathology images is essential for cancer
diagnosis and prognosis. However, significant variability in Hematoxylin and
Eosin (H&E) staining and tissue morphology, combined with limited annotated
data, poses major challenges for automated segmentation. To address this, we
propose Color-Structure Dual-Student (CSDS), a novel semi-supervised
segmentation framework designed to learn disentangled representations of stain
appearance and tissue structure. CSDS comprises two specialized student
networks: one trained on stain-augmented inputs to model chromatic variation,
and the other on structure-augmented inputs to capture morphological cues. A
shared teacher network, updated via Exponential Moving Average (EMA),
supervises both students through pseudo-labels. To further improve label
reliability, we introduce stain-aware and structure-aware uncertainty
estimation modules that adaptively modulate the contribution of each student
during training. Experiments on the GlaS and CRAG datasets show that CSDS
achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-label settings, with Dice score
improvements of up to 1.2% on GlaS and 0.7% on CRAG at 5% labeled data, and
0.7% and 1.4% at 10%. Our code and pre-trained models are available at

Motivation: 现有方法利用噪声图像预测内在属性，但噪声图像的结构和外观信息已退化，影响逆向渲染质量。

Method: 采用源图像作为输入，通过流匹配直接预测确定性内在属性，并设计生成渲染器确保物理真实性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，DNF-Intrinsic明显优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DNF-Intrinsic通过改进输入和约束物理真实性，显著提升了逆向渲染的鲁棒性和质量。

Abstract: Recent methods have shown that pre-trained diffusion models can be fine-tuned
to enable generative inverse rendering by learning image-conditioned
noise-to-intrinsic mapping. Despite their remarkable progress, they struggle to
robustly produce high-quality results as the noise-to-intrinsic paradigm
essentially utilizes noisy images with deteriorated structure and appearance
for intrinsic prediction, while it is common knowledge that structure and
appearance information in an image are crucial for inverse rendering. To
address this issue, we present DNF-Intrinsic, a robust yet efficient inverse
rendering approach fine-tuned from a pre-trained diffusion model, where we
propose to take the source image rather than Gaussian noise as input to
directly predict deterministic intrinsic properties via flow matching.
Moreover, we design a generative renderer to constrain that the predicted
intrinsic properties are physically faithful to the source image. Experiments
on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method clearly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GCN方法将交互个体视为独立图，忽略其内在依赖关系；预定义交互矩阵无法适应动态和上下文特定的联合交互。

Method: 结合GCN建模个体内部关系，引入AT-NAC模块动态选择节点，EA模块捕捉交互动态和语义关系。

Result: 实验表明，ASEA能更有效灵活地捕捉交互关系，达到最优性能。

Conclusion: ASEA通过动态节点选择和外部注意力机制，显著改进了交互建模，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Most GCN-based methods model interacting individuals as independent graphs,
neglecting their inherent inter-dependencies. Although recent approaches
utilize predefined interaction adjacency matrices to integrate participants,
these matrices fail to adaptively capture the dynamic and context-specific
joint interactions across different actions. In this paper, we propose the
Active Node Selection with External Attention Network (ASEA), an innovative
approach that dynamically captures interaction relationships without predefined
assumptions. Our method models each participant individually using a GCN to
capture intra-personal relationships, facilitating a detailed representation of
their actions. To identify the most relevant nodes for interaction modeling, we
introduce the Adaptive Temporal Node Amplitude Calculation (AT-NAC) module,
which estimates global node activity by combining spatial motion magnitude with
adaptive temporal weighting, thereby highlighting salient motion patterns while
reducing irrelevant or redundant information. A learnable threshold,
regularized to prevent extreme variations, is defined to selectively identify
the most informative nodes for interaction modeling. To capture interactions,
we design the External Attention (EA) module to operate on active nodes,
effectively modeling the interaction dynamics and semantic relationships
between individuals. Extensive evaluations show that our method captures
interaction relationships more effectively and flexibly, achieving
state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: 该框架利用低成本VI数据实现高效场景流估计，为智能车辆提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: This work proposes a mmWave radar's scene flow estimation framework
supervised by data from a widespread visual-inertial (VI) sensor suite,
allowing crowdsourced training data from smart vehicles. Current scene flow
estimation methods for mmWave radar are typically supervised by dense point
clouds from 3D LiDARs, which are expensive and not widely available in smart
vehicles. While VI data are more accessible, visual images alone cannot capture
the 3D motions of moving objects, making it difficult to supervise their scene
flow. Moreover, the temporal drift of VI rigid transformation also degenerates
the scene flow estimation of static points. To address these challenges, we
propose a drift-free rigid transformation estimator that fuses kinematic
model-based ego-motions with neural network-learned results. It provides strong
supervision signals to radar-based rigid transformation and infers the scene
flow of static points. Then, we develop an optical-mmWave supervision
extraction module that extracts the supervision signals of radar rigid
transformation and scene flow. It strengthens the supervision by learning the
scene flow of dynamic points with the joint constraints of optical and mmWave
radar measurements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, in smoke-filled
environments, our method even outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches
using costly LiDARs.

Abstract: Synthesizing normal-light novel views from low-light multiview images is an
important yet challenging task, given the low visibility and high ISO noise
present in the input images. Existing low-light enhancement methods often
struggle to effectively preprocess such low-light inputs, as they fail to
consider correlations among multiple views. Although other state-of-the-art
methods have introduced illumination-related components offering alternative
solutions to the problem, they often result in drawbacks such as color
distortions and artifacts, and they provide limited denoising effectiveness. In
this paper, we propose a novel Robust Low-light Scene Restoration framework
(RoSe), which enables effective synthesis of novel views in normal lighting
conditions from low-light multiview image inputs, by formulating the task as an
illuminance transition estimation problem in 3D space, conceptualizing it as a
specialized rendering task. This multiview-consistent illuminance transition
field establishes a robust connection between low-light and normal-light
conditions. By further exploiting the inherent low-rank property of
illumination to constrain the transition representation, we achieve more
effective denoising without complex 2D techniques or explicit noise modeling.
To implement RoSe, we design a concise dual-branch architecture and introduce a
low-rank denoising module. Experiments demonstrate that RoSe significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art models in both rendering quality and multiview
consistency on standard benchmarks. The codes and data are available at

Abstract: Effective Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is criti-cal for ensuring the
reliability of semantic segmentation models, particularly in complex road
environments where safety and accuracy are paramount. Despite recent
advancements in large language models (LLMs), notably GPT-4, which
significantly enhanced multimodal reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting, the application of CoT-based visual reasoning for OOD semantic
segmentation remains largely unexplored. In this paper, through extensive
analyses of the road scene anomalies, we identify three challenging scenarios
where current state-of-the-art OOD segmentation methods consistently struggle:
(1) densely packed and overlapping objects, (2) distant scenes with small
objects, and (3) large foreground-dominant objects. To address the presented
challenges, we propose a novel CoT-based framework targeting OOD detection in
road anomaly scenes. Our method leverages the extensive knowledge and reasoning
capabilities of foundation models, such as GPT-4, to enhance OOD detection
through improved image understanding and prompt-based reasoning aligned with
observed problematic scene attributes. Extensive experiments show that our
framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both standard
benchmarks and our newly defined challenging subset of the RoadAnomaly dataset,
offering a robust and interpretable solution for OOD semantic segmentation in
complex driving environments.

Motivation: BEV语义分割在自动驾驶中至关重要，但无监督和半监督学习因标注数据分布单一表现不佳，合成数据虽能增强多样性但存在噪声问题。

Method: 提出NRSeg框架，包括PGCM评估生成数据质量，BiDPP通过并行预测增强鲁棒性，HLSE解决非互斥性问题。

Conclusion: NRSeg通过抗噪声设计和模块优化，显著提升了BEV语义分割性能，为自动驾驶感知任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Birds' Eye View (BEV) semantic segmentation is an indispensable perception
task in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Unsupervised and semi-supervised
learning for BEV tasks, as pivotal for real-world applications, underperform
due to the homogeneous distribution of the labeled data. In this work, we
explore the potential of synthetic data from driving world models to enhance
the diversity of labeled data for robustifying BEV segmentation. Yet, our
preliminary findings reveal that generation noise in synthetic data compromises
efficient BEV model learning. To fully harness the potential of synthetic data
from world models, this paper proposes NRSeg, a noise-resilient learning
framework for BEV semantic segmentation. Specifically, a Perspective-Geometry
Consistency Metric (PGCM) is proposed to quantitatively evaluate the guidance
capability of generated data for model learning. This metric originates from
the alignment measure between the perspective road mask of generated data and
the mask projected from the BEV labels. Moreover, a Bi-Distribution Parallel
Prediction (BiDPP) is designed to enhance the inherent robustness of the model,
where the learning process is constrained through parallel prediction of
multinomial and Dirichlet distributions. The former efficiently predicts
semantic probabilities, whereas the latter adopts evidential deep learning to
realize uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, a Hierarchical Local Semantic
Exclusion (HLSE) module is designed to address the non-mutual exclusivity
inherent in BEV semantic segmentation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate
that NRSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding the highest
improvements in mIoU of 13.8% and 11.4% in unsupervised and semi-supervised BEV
segmentation tasks, respectively. The source code will be made publicly

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的DGFAS框架，通过FOD和GS-RM联合对齐权重和偏置，解决了现有方法中偏置项未对齐的问题，提升了泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DGFAS方法仅对齐局部决策边界的权重，而偏置项未对齐，导致分类阈值不一致，影响性能。

Method: 结合FOD（特征正交分解）和GS-RM（分组缩放风险最小化），FOD明确分解特征空间为域不变和域特定子空间，GS-RM平衡多域分组损失以对齐偏置。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优异，提高了准确性，减少了偏置不对齐，增强了泛化稳定性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了偏置对齐问题，实现了SOTA性能，并引入ECE作为评估指标。

Abstract: Domain Generalizable Face Anti-Spoofing (DGFAS) methods effectively capture
domain-invariant features by aligning the directions (weights) of local
decision boundaries across domains. However, the bias terms associated with
these boundaries remain misaligned, leading to inconsistent classification
thresholds and degraded performance on unseen target domains. To address this
issue, we propose a novel DGFAS framework that jointly aligns weights and
biases through Feature Orthogonal Decomposition (FOD) and Group-wise Scaling
Risk Minimization (GS-RM). Specifically, GS-RM facilitates bias alignment by
balancing group-wise losses across multiple domains. FOD employs the
Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process to decompose the feature space
explicitly into domain-invariant and domain-specific subspaces. By enforcing
orthogonality between domain-specific and domain-invariant features during
training using domain labels, FOD ensures effective weight alignment across
domains without negatively impacting bias alignment. Additionally, we introduce
Expected Calibration Error (ECE) as a novel evaluation metric for
quantitatively assessing the effectiveness of our method in aligning bias terms
across domains. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently improving
accuracy, reducing bias misalignment, and enhancing generalization stability on

TL;DR: 该研究利用深度神经网络（CNN和ViT）对地面级生境图像进行分类，ViT表现优于CNN，且监督对比学习显著减少了相似生境的误分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生境评估依赖专家调查，成本高，AI驱动的自动化工具可降低成本并提高精度。

Method: 使用CNN和ViT模型，结合监督和监督对比学习范式，对英国Countryside Survey的18类生境图像进行分类。

Result: ViT在分类指标上优于CNN（Top-3准确率91%，MCC=0.66），监督对比学习减少了相似生境的误分类。

Conclusion: 结合AI与生态学专业知识，为地面级生境监测提供了可扩展、经济高效的框架。

Abstract: Habitat assessment at local scales -- critical for enhancing biodiversity and
guiding conservation priorities -- often relies on expert field survey that can
be costly, motivating the exploration of AI-driven tools to automate and refine
this process. While most AI-driven habitat mapping depends on remote sensing,
it is often constrained by sensor availability, weather, and coarse resolution.
In contrast, ground-level imagery captures essential structural and
compositional cues invisible from above and remains underexplored for robust,
fine-grained habitat classification. This study addresses this gap by applying
state-of-the-art deep neural network architectures to ground-level habitat
imagery. Leveraging data from the UK Countryside Survey covering 18 broad
habitat types, we evaluate two families of models -- convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) -- under both supervised and
supervised contrastive learning paradigms. Our results demonstrate that ViTs
consistently outperform state-of-the-art CNN baselines on key classification
metrics (Top-3 accuracy = 91\%, MCC = 0.66) and offer more interpretable scene
understanding tailored to ground-level images. Moreover, supervised contrastive
learning significantly reduces misclassification rates among visually similar
habitats (e.g., Improved vs. Neutral Grassland), driven by a more
discriminative embedding space. Finally, our best model performs on par with
experienced ecological experts in habitat classification from images,
underscoring the promise of expert-level automated assessment. By integrating
advanced AI with ecological expertise, this research establishes a scalable,
cost-effective framework for ground-level habitat monitoring to accelerate
biodiversity conservation and inform land-use decisions at the national scale.

TL;DR: 用KANs替换ViTs中的MLPs，通过局部可塑性减少灾难性遗忘，提升持续学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ViTs在持续学习中因MLPs导致的灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: 用Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks（KANs）替代MLPs，利用基于样条的激活实现局部参数更新。

Result: KAN-based ViTs在MNIST和CIFAR100上显著减少遗忘，优于传统MLP-based ViTs。

Conclusion: KANs与ViTs结合为动态环境提供了更鲁棒和适应性强的模型。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL), the ability of a model to learn new tasks without
forgetting previously acquired knowledge, remains a critical challenge in
artificial intelligence, particularly for vision transformers (ViTs) utilizing
Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) for global representation learning. Catastrophic
forgetting, where new information overwrites prior knowledge, is especially
problematic in these models. This research proposes replacing MLPs in ViTs with
Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KANs) to address this issue. KANs leverage local
plasticity through spline-based activations, ensuring that only a subset of
parameters is updated per sample, thereby preserving previously learned
knowledge. The study investigates the efficacy of KAN-based ViTs in CL
scenarios across benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR100), focusing on their
ability to retain accuracy on earlier tasks while adapting to new ones.
Experimental results demonstrate that KAN-based ViTs significantly mitigate
catastrophic forgetting, outperforming traditional MLP-based ViTs in knowledge
retention and task adaptation. This novel integration of KANs into ViTs
represents a promising step toward more robust and adaptable models for dynamic
environments.

Motivation: 现有方法仅生成静态幻灯片或文本摘要，无法满足动态演示需求。

Method: 模块化流程：文档分段、幻灯片生成、语音合成、音视频同步。

Result: 在30组文档-演示对中，PresentAgent接近人类水平。

Conclusion: 可控多模态代理在动态演示领域潜力显著。

Abstract: We present PresentAgent, a multimodal agent that transforms long-form
documents into narrated presentation videos. While existing approaches are
limited to generating static slides or text summaries, our method advances
beyond these limitations by producing fully synchronized visual and spoken
content that closely mimics human-style presentations. To achieve this
integration, PresentAgent employs a modular pipeline that systematically
segments the input document, plans and renders slide-style visual frames,
generates contextual spoken narration with large language models and
Text-to-Speech models, and seamlessly composes the final video with precise
audio-visual alignment. Given the complexity of evaluating such multimodal
outputs, we introduce PresentEval, a unified assessment framework powered by
Vision-Language Models that comprehensively scores videos across three critical
dimensions: content fidelity, visual clarity, and audience comprehension
through prompt-based evaluation. Our experimental validation on a curated
dataset of 30 document-presentation pairs demonstrates that PresentAgent
approaches human-level quality across all evaluation metrics. These results
highlight the significant potential of controllable multimodal agents in
transforming static textual materials into dynamic, effective, and accessible
presentation formats. Code will be available at

Conclusion: 合成数据是解决医学影像数据不足的有效方法，T-SYNTH为研究提供了开放资源。

Abstract: One of the key impediments for developing and assessing robust medical
imaging algorithms is limited access to large-scale datasets with suitable
annotations. Synthetic data generated with plausible physical and biological
constraints may address some of these data limitations. We propose the use of
physics simulations to generate synthetic images with pixel-level segmentation
annotations, which are notoriously difficult to obtain. Specifically, we apply
this approach to breast imaging analysis and release T-SYNTH, a large-scale
open-source dataset of paired 2D digital mammography (DM) and 3D digital breast
tomosynthesis (DBT) images. Our initial experimental results indicate that
T-SYNTH images show promise for augmenting limited real patient datasets for

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MTU3D优于现有方法，成功率提升14%至23%。

Conclusion: 结合视觉定位与探索对具身智能至关重要，MTU3D展示了其有效性。

Abstract: Embodied scene understanding requires not only comprehending visual-spatial
information that has been observed but also determining where to explore next
in the 3D physical world. Existing 3D Vision-Language (3D-VL) models primarily
focus on grounding objects in static observations from 3D reconstruction, such
as meshes and point clouds, but lack the ability to actively perceive and
explore their environment. To address this limitation, we introduce
\underline{\textbf{M}}ove \underline{\textbf{t}}o
\underline{\textbf{U}}nderstand (\textbf{\model}), a unified framework that
integrates active perception with \underline{\textbf{3D}} vision-language
learning, enabling embodied agents to effectively explore and understand their
environment. This is achieved by three key innovations: 1) Online query-based
representation learning, enabling direct spatial memory construction from RGB-D
frames, eliminating the need for explicit 3D reconstruction. 2) A unified
objective for grounding and exploring, which represents unexplored locations as
frontier queries and jointly optimizes object grounding and frontier selection.
3) End-to-end trajectory learning that combines
\textbf{V}ision-\textbf{L}anguage-\textbf{E}xploration pre-training over a
million diverse trajectories collected from both simulated and real-world RGB-D
sequences. Extensive evaluations across various embodied navigation and
question-answering benchmarks show that MTU3D outperforms state-of-the-art
reinforcement learning and modular navigation approaches by 14\%, 23\%, 9\%,
and 2\% in success rate on HM3D-OVON, GOAT-Bench, SG3D, and A-EQA,
respectively. \model's versatility enables navigation using diverse input
modalities, including categories, language descriptions, and reference images.
These findings highlight the importance of bridging visual grounding and
exploration for embodied intelligence.

Motivation: 模仿学习依赖单一专家演示，导致保守行为和泛化能力不足。

Method: 使用扩散生成机制生成多样化轨迹，并通过强化学习优化安全性和多样性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提升轨迹多样性，解决模式崩溃问题。

Conclusion: DIVER有效增强自动驾驶的泛化能力和实用性。

Abstract: Most end-to-end autonomous driving methods rely on imitation learning from
single expert demonstrations, often leading to conservative and homogeneous
behaviors that limit generalization in complex real-world scenarios. In this
work, we propose DIVER, an end-to-end driving framework that integrates
reinforcement learning with diffusion-based generation to produce diverse and
feasible trajectories. At the core of DIVER lies a reinforced diffusion-based
generation mechanism. First, the model conditions on map elements and
surrounding agents to generate multiple reference trajectories from a single
ground-truth trajectory, alleviating the limitations of imitation learning that
arise from relying solely on single expert demonstrations. Second,
reinforcement learning is employed to guide the diffusion process, where
reward-based supervision enforces safety and diversity constraints on the
generated trajectories, thereby enhancing their practicality and generalization
capability. Furthermore, to address the limitations of L2-based open-loop
metrics in capturing trajectory diversity, we propose a novel Diversity metric
to evaluate the diversity of multi-mode predictions.Extensive experiments on
the closed-loop NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks, as well as the open-loop
nuScenes dataset, demonstrate that DIVER significantly improves trajectory
diversity, effectively addressing the mode collapse problem inherent in
imitation learning.

Conclusion: DiffGRE通过合成数据和多阶段优化，显著提升了OCD任务中已知和未知类别的发现能力。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a practical yet challenging task: On-the-fly
Category Discovery (OCD). This task focuses on the online identification of
newly arriving stream data that may belong to both known and unknown
categories, utilizing the category knowledge from only labeled data. Existing
OCD methods are devoted to fully mining transferable knowledge from only
labeled data. However, the transferability learned by these methods is limited
because the knowledge contained in known categories is often insufficient,
especially when few annotated data/categories are available in fine-grained
recognition. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a diffusion-based OCD
framework, dubbed DiffGRE, which integrates Generation, Refinement, and
Encoding in a multi-stage fashion. Specifically, we first design an
attribute-composition generation method based on cross-image interpolation in
the diffusion latent space to synthesize novel samples. Then, we propose a
diversity-driven refinement approach to select the synthesized images that
differ from known categories for subsequent OCD model training. Finally, we
leverage a semi-supervised leader encoding to inject additional category
knowledge contained in synthesized data into the OCD models, which can benefit
the discovery of both known and unknown categories during the on-the-fly
inference process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
DiffGRE over previous methods on six fine-grained datasets.

Result: 在四个HMP基准数据集上的实验证明了TCL的有效性和灵活性。

Conclusion: TCL框架能轻松集成到不同HMP模型中，适用于多种数据集和应用。

Abstract: Human Motion Prediction (HMP) aims to predict future poses at different
moments according to past motion sequences. Previous approaches have treated
the prediction of various moments equally, resulting in two main limitations:
the learning of short-term predictions is hindered by the focus on long-term
predictions, and the incorporation of prior information from past predictions
into subsequent predictions is limited. In this paper, we introduce a novel
multi-stage training framework called Temporal Continual Learning (TCL) to
address the above challenges. To better preserve prior information, we
introduce the Prior Compensation Factor (PCF). We incorporate it into the model
training to compensate for the lost prior information. Furthermore, we derive a
more reasonable optimization objective through theoretical derivation. It is
important to note that our TCL framework can be easily integrated with
different HMP backbone models and adapted to various datasets and applications.
Extensive experiments on four HMP benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and flexibility of TCL. The code is available at

Abstract: Short-video misinformation detection has attracted wide attention in the
multi-modal domain, aiming to accurately identify the misinformation in the
video format accompanied by the corresponding audio. Despite significant
advancements, current models in this field, trained on particular domains
(source domains), often exhibit unsatisfactory performance on unseen domains
(target domains) due to domain gaps. To effectively realize such domain
generalization on the short-video misinformation detection task, we propose
deep insights into the characteristics of different domains: (1) The detection
on various domains may mainly rely on different modalities (i.e., mainly
focusing on videos or audios). To enhance domain generalization, it is crucial
to achieve optimal model performance on all modalities simultaneously. (2) For
some domains focusing on cross-modal joint fraud, a comprehensive analysis
relying on cross-modal fusion is necessary. However, domain biases located in
each modality (especially in each frame of videos) will be accumulated in this
fusion process, which may seriously damage the final identification of
misinformation. To address these issues, we propose a new DOmain generalization
model via ConsisTency and invariance learning for shORt-video misinformation
detection (named DOCTOR), which contains two characteristic modules: (1) We
involve the cross-modal feature interpolation to map multiple modalities into a
shared space and the interpolation distillation to synchronize multi-modal
learning; (2) We design the diffusion model to add noise to retain core
features of multi modal and enhance domain invariant features through
cross-modal guided denoising. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed DOCTOR model. Our code is public available at

Result: 在四个运动预测数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: STAB和ACB结合AAA策略有效解决了过渡平滑性和动作特征学习问题，提升了预测效果。

Abstract: Action-driven stochastic human motion prediction aims to generate future
motion sequences of a pre-defined target action based on given past observed
sequences performing non-target actions. This task primarily presents two
challenges. Firstly, generating smooth transition motions is hard due to the
varying transition speeds of different actions. Secondly, the action
characteristic is difficult to be learned because of the similarity of some
actions. These issues cause the predicted results to be unreasonable and
inconsistent. As a result, we propose two memory banks, the Soft-transition
Action Bank (STAB) and Action Characteristic Bank (ACB), to tackle the problems
above. The STAB stores the action transition information. It is equipped with
the novel soft searching approach, which encourages the model to focus on
multiple possible action categories of observed motions. The ACB records action
characteristic, which produces more prior information for predicting certain
actions. To fuse the features retrieved from the two banks better, we further
propose the Adaptive Attention Adjustment (AAA) strategy. Extensive experiments
on four motion prediction datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms the previous state-of-the-art. The demo and code are available at

Abstract: In this paper, we present a high-performing solution to the UAVM 2025
Challenge, which focuses on matching narrow FOV street-level images to
corresponding satellite imagery using the University-1652 dataset. As panoramic
Cross-View Geo-Localisation nears peak performance, it becomes increasingly
important to explore more practical problem formulations. Real-world scenarios
rarely offer panoramic street-level queries; instead, queries typically consist
of limited-FOV images captured with unknown camera parameters. Our work
prioritises discovering the highest achievable performance under these
constraints, pushing the limits of existing architectures. Our method begins by
retrieving candidate satellite image embeddings for a given query, followed by
a re-ranking stage that selectively enhances retrieval accuracy within the top
candidates. This two-stage approach enables more precise matching, even under
the significant viewpoint and scale variations inherent in the task. Through
experimentation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive results
-specifically attaining R@1 and R@10 retrieval rates of \topone\% and \topten\%
respectively. This underscores the potential of optimised retrieval and
re-ranking strategies in advancing practical geo-localisation performance. Code

Result: 实验表明，GaPP-Class和GaPP-ReaCtion在合成和真实数据上优于现有方法，GaPP-ReaCtion显著减少轨迹中断（如真实雷达数据减少约30%）。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在复杂场景中表现出高效性和鲁棒性，适用于动态多目标跟踪任务。

Abstract: This paper presents a computationally efficient multi-object tracking
approach that can minimise track breaks (e.g., in challenging environments and
against agile targets), learn the measurement model parameters on-line (e.g.,
in dynamically changing scenes) and infer the class of the tracked objects, if
joint tracking and kinematic behaviour classification is sought. It capitalises
on the flexibilities offered by the integrated Gaussian process as a motion
model and the convenient statistical properties of non-homogeneous Poisson
processes as a suitable observation model. This can be combined with the
proposed effective track revival / stitching mechanism. We accordingly
introduce the two robust and adaptive trackers, Gaussian and Poisson Process
with Classification (GaPP-Class) and GaPP with Revival and Classification
(GaPP-ReaCtion). They employ an appropriate particle filtering inference scheme
that efficiently integrates track management and hyperparameter learning
(including the object class, if relevant). GaPP-ReaCtion extends GaPP-Class
with the addition of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo kernel applied to each particle
permitting track revival and stitching (e.g., within a few time steps after
deleting a trajectory). Performance evaluation and benchmarking using synthetic
and real data show that GaPP-Class and GaPP-ReaCtion outperform other
state-of-the-art tracking algorithms. For example, GaPP-ReaCtion significantly
reduces track breaks (e.g., by around 30% from real radar data and markedly
more from simulated data).

Conclusion: PromptSR通过结合全局先验和局部细节，显著扩大了接收域，同时保持低计算成本，是一种高效的图像超分辨率方法。

Abstract: Although the lightweight Vision Transformer has significantly advanced image
super-resolution (SR), it faces the inherent challenge of a limited receptive
field due to the window-based self-attention modeling. The quadratic
computational complexity relative to window size restricts its ability to use a
large window size for expanding the receptive field while maintaining low
computational costs. To address this challenge, we propose PromptSR, a novel
prompt-empowered lightweight image SR method. The core component is the
proposed cascade prompting block (CPB), which enhances global information
access and local refinement via three cascaded prompting layers: a global
anchor prompting layer (GAPL) and two local prompting layers (LPLs). The GAPL
leverages downscaled features as anchors to construct low-dimensional anchor
prompts (APs) through cross-scale attention, significantly reducing
computational costs. These APs, with enhanced global perception, are then used
to provide global prompts, efficiently facilitating long-range token
connections. The two LPLs subsequently combine category-based self-attention
and window-based self-attention to refine the representation in a
coarse-to-fine manner. They leverage attention maps from the GAPL as additional
global prompts, enabling them to perceive features globally at different
granularities for adaptive local refinement. In this way, the proposed CPB
effectively combines global priors and local details, significantly enlarging
the receptive field while maintaining the low computational costs of our
PromptSR. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method,
which outperforms state-of-the-art lightweight SR methods in quantitative,
qualitative, and complexity evaluations. Our code will be released at
https://github.com/wenyang001/PromptSR.

Abstract: This paper presents Edge-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) Collaborative

MoE architecture specifically optimized for edge platforms. By effectively
fusing LiDAR and camera data, the system leverages the complementary strengths
of sparse 3D point clouds and dense 2D images to generate robust multimodal

bridge that performs multi-scale preprocessing on sensor inputs, followed by a
scenario-aware routing mechanism that dynamically dispatches features to
dedicated expert models based on object visibility and distance. In addition,
EMC2 integrates joint hardware-software optimizations, including hardware
resource utilization optimization and computational graph simplification, to
ensure efficient and real-time inference on resource-constrained edge devices.
Experiments on open-source benchmarks clearly show the EMC2 advancements as a

Motivation: 提高自动驾驶车辆控制权转移的安全性，需要准确及时评估驾驶员准备状态。

Method: 采用三摄像头捕捉驾驶员头、手和身体姿势的同步视觉线索，结合双路径架构和跨模态融合策略。

Result: 在多样化数据集上测试，准确率达95.8%，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Driver-Net为实时、非侵入性解决方案，提升自动驾驶安全性，符合新法规要求。

Abstract: Ensuring safe transition of control in automated vehicles requires an
accurate and timely assessment of driver readiness. This paper introduces
Driver-Net, a novel deep learning framework that fuses multi-camera inputs to
estimate driver take-over readiness. Unlike conventional vision-based driver
monitoring systems that focus on head pose or eye gaze, Driver-Net captures
synchronised visual cues from the driver's head, hands, and body posture
through a triple-camera setup. The model integrates spatio-temporal data using
a dual-path architecture, comprising a Context Block and a Feature Block,
followed by a cross-modal fusion strategy to enhance prediction accuracy.
Evaluated on a diverse dataset collected from the University of Leeds Driving
Simulator, the proposed method achieves an accuracy of up to 95.8% in driver
readiness classification. This performance significantly enhances existing
approaches and highlights the importance of multimodal and multi-view fusion.
As a real-time, non-intrusive solution, Driver-Net contributes meaningfully to
the development of safer and more reliable automated vehicles and aligns with
new regulatory mandates and upcoming safety standards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于视觉的行人过街意图预测方法在泛化性、上下文理解和因果推理方面存在不足。

Method: 采用分层提示模板整合视觉帧、物理线索和车辆动态等多模态数据，并通过自动提示工程优化提示。

Result: 在JAAD、PIE和FU-PIP数据集上，预测准确性最高提升19.8%，优化提示进一步提升了12.5%。

Conclusion: VLFMs在行人意图预测中优于传统视觉模型，为自动驾驶提供了更强的泛化能力和上下文理解。

Abstract: Prediction of pedestrian crossing intention is a critical function in
autonomous vehicles. Conventional vision-based methods of crossing intention
prediction often struggle with generalizability, context understanding, and
causal reasoning. This study explores the potential of vision-language
foundation models (VLFMs) for predicting pedestrian crossing intentions by
integrating multimodal data through hierarchical prompt templates. The
methodology incorporates contextual information, including visual frames,
physical cues observations, and ego-vehicle dynamics, into systematically
refined prompts to guide VLFMs effectively in intention prediction. Experiments
were conducted on three common datasets-JAAD, PIE, and FU-PIP. Results
demonstrate that incorporating vehicle speed, its variations over time, and
time-conscious prompts significantly enhances the prediction accuracy up to
19.8%. Additionally, optimised prompts generated via an automatic prompt
engineering framework yielded 12.5% further accuracy gains. These findings
highlight the superior performance of VLFMs compared to conventional
vision-based models, offering enhanced generalisation and contextual
understanding for autonomous driving applications.

*Fernando Gabriela Garcia,Spencer Burns,Ryan Shaw,Hunter Young*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hi-SSLVLM是一种新型生成模型，通过两阶段自监督学习策略显著提升复杂文本到图像合成的能力，解决了传统方法依赖标注数据和精细控制不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文本到图像合成方法依赖昂贵的人工标注数据，且难以精确控制视觉属性和空间关系。Hi-SSLVLM旨在通过自监督学习减少对标注数据的依赖，并提升生成图像的语义一致性和可控性。

Method: Hi-SSLVLM采用两阶段策略：1）多粒度视觉-语言对齐，自主生成层次化标题并与图像对齐；2）自优化和引导图像生成，通过内部组合规划机制生成子提示，并结合语义一致性损失确保输出对齐。

Result: 实验表明，Hi-SSLVLM在多个基准测试中优于主流模型（如Janus-Pro-1B、Stable Diffusion XL等），在细粒度指标和人类评估中表现卓越。

Conclusion: Hi-SSLVLM在可控性和语义一致性方面取得了显著进步，为开放式文本到图像生成提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces Hierarchical Self-Supervised LVLM (Hi-SSLVLM), a novel
generative model designed to significantly advance text-to-image synthesis,
particularly for complex and compositionally challenging prompts. Traditional
methods often grapple with the high cost of meticulously curated paired
image-text datasets and struggle with precise control over fine-grained visual
attributes and intricate spatial relationships. Our Hi-SSLVLM addresses these
limitations through a unique two-stage self-supervised learning strategy. The
first stage, Multi-Granularity Visual-Language Grounding, enables the Large
Vision-Language Model (LVLM) backbone to autonomously generate and align
hierarchical captions (global and local) to images, cultivating a deep internal
semantic understanding without reliance on extensive human annotation. The
second stage, Self-Refinement and Guided Image Generation, leverages this
acquired knowledge by an Internal Compositional Planning (ICP) mechanism, where
the LVLM first formulates detailed textual sub-prompts to guide the image
generation process, complemented by a novel Semantic Consistency Loss for
precise output alignment. Comprehensive experiments against leading baselines,
including Janus-Pro-1B, Stable Diffusion XL 1.0, DeepFloyd IF v1.0, and
ControlNet-XL, on multi-dimensional benchmarks such as Gemini-2.0-Flash and
InternVL3-78B, demonstrate Hi-SSLVLM's superior performance across all
fine-grained metrics. An in-depth ablation study confirms the critical role of
each proposed component. Furthermore, human evaluations corroborate our
quantitative findings, highlighting Hi-SSLVLM's enhanced fidelity to prompt,
compositional accuracy, and overall aesthetic quality, marking a significant
step towards more controllable and semantically consistent open-ended
text-to-image generation.

Conclusion: LVLM-Composer在可控性和组合准确性方面取得了重要进展，为开放域文本到图像生成提供了新方向。

Abstract: The burgeoning field of generative artificial intelligence has fundamentally
reshaped our approach to content creation, with Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) standing at its forefront. While current LVLMs have demonstrated
impressive capabilities in text-to-image generation, they often falter when
confronted with complex textual descriptions demanding precise compositional
understanding and visual planning. This limitation particularly impacts the
accurate rendering of multiple objects, their attributes, spatial
relationships, and specific poses within intricate scenes, as evidenced by
benchmarks like LongBench-T2I. To address these challenges, we introduce
LVLM-Composer, a novel 10-billion parameter scale LVLM specifically engineered
for enhanced compositional image synthesis. Our method incorporates a
Hierarchical Semantic Planning Module for structured prompt decomposition and a
Fine-Grained Feature Alignment Mechanism for precise visual guidance during
generation. We propose a multi-stage training paradigm, featuring Hierarchical
Semantic-Visual Grounding Pre-training and Compositional Planning Reinforcement
Learning with Self-Correction, to instill robust compositional reasoning.
Extensive experiments on the LongBench-T2I benchmark, utilizing automatic
evaluation by Gemini-2.0-Flash and InternVL3-78B, demonstrate LVLM-Composer's
superior performance across critical compositional dimensions including object
accuracy, composition fidelity, and pose accuracy, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines. An in-depth ablation study further validates the
indispensable contribution of our proposed modules, while human evaluations
confirm the perceptual superiority of our generated images. LVLM-Composer
represents a significant step towards truly controllable and compositionally
accurate open-ended text-to-image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究从单视图生成无界动态场景的问题，应用于增强/虚拟现实和机器人领域。现有方法因依赖多视图训练，生成的场景区域受限。

Method: 将单视图视频映射到动态点云，利用射线上下文渲染部分视频并外绘，生成3D一致运动，通过更新点云实现无界场景生成。

Result: 实验表明，模型能生成无界场景，运动一致且可通过场景提示控制生成内容。

Conclusion: DynamicVoyager有效解决了单视图动态场景生成的3D一致性问题，扩展了应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of generating an unbounded dynamic scene from
a single view, which has wide applications in augmented/virtual reality and
robotics. Since the scene is changing over time, different generated views need
to be consistent with the underlying 3D motions. While previous works learn
such consistency by training from multiple views, the generated scene regions
are bounded to be close to the training views with limited camera movements. To
address this issue, we propose DynamicVoyager that reformulates the dynamic
scene generation as a scene outpainting process for new dynamic content. As 2D
outpainting models can hardly generate 3D consistent motions from only 2D
pixels at a single view, we consider pixels as rays to enrich the pixel input
with the ray context, so that the 3D motion consistency can be learned from the
ray information. More specifically, we first map the single-view video input to
a dynamic point cloud with the estimated video depths. Then we render the
partial video at a novel view and outpaint the video with ray contexts from the
point cloud to generate 3D consistent motions. We employ the outpainted video
to update the point cloud, which is used for scene outpainting from future
novel views. Experiments show that our model is able to generate unbounded
scenes with consistent motions along fly-through cameras, and the generated
contents can be controlled with scene prompts.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过空间变化的增益和像素合并技术来提升图像传感器的噪声性能和动态范围的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着像素尺寸的缩小，图像质量因光积累减少而下降，需要解决分辨率、噪声和动态范围之间的平衡问题。

Method: 采用空间变化的增益和像素合并策略，根据局部场景亮度调整增益和合并大小。

Result: 动态范围扩展了一个数量级，信噪比显著提升，数字合并在高增益下优于模拟合并。

Conclusion: 空间变化的增益和合并技术可有效提升图像质量，适用于高动态范围成像等应用。

Abstract: Pixels in image sensors have progressively become smaller, driven by the goal
of producing higher-resolution imagery. However, ceteris paribus, a smaller
pixel accumulates less light, making image quality worse. This interplay of
resolution, noise, and the dynamic range of the sensor and their impact on the
eventual quality of acquired imagery is a fundamental concept in photography.
In this paper, we propose spatially-varying gain and binning to enhance the
noise performance and dynamic range of image sensors. First, we show that by
varying gain spatially to local scene brightness, the read noise can be made
negligible, and the dynamic range of a sensor is expanded by an order of
magnitude. Second, we propose a simple analysis to find a binning size that
best balances resolution and noise for a given light level; this analysis
predicts a spatially-varying binning strategy, again based on local scene
brightness, to effectively increase the overall signal-to-noise ratio. %
without sacrificing resolution. We discuss analog and digital binning modes
and, perhaps surprisingly, show that digital binning outperforms its analog
counterparts when a larger gain is allowed. Finally, we demonstrate that
combining spatially-varying gain and binning in various applications, including
high dynamic range imaging, vignetting, and lens distortion.

Motivation: 现有零样本方法在图像恢复任务中迭代时间过长，限制了扩散模型的实际应用。

Method: 通过QBM从中间近似初始化以绕过早期去噪步骤，并通过RRP调整随机噪声权重以增强随机性。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K和CelebA-HQ上的实验表明，方法能有效加速现有方法并保持性能。

Conclusion: QBM和RRP为扩散模型在图像恢复任务中的高效应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success
in various image generation tasks. Building upon these achievements, diffusion
models have also been effectively adapted to image restoration tasks, e.g.,
super-resolution and deblurring, aiming to recover high-quality images from
degraded inputs. Although existing zero-shot approaches enable pretrained
diffusion models to perform restoration tasks without additional fine-tuning,
these methods often suffer from prolonged iteration times in the denoising
process. To address this limitation, we propose a Quick Bypass Mechanism (QBM),
a strategy that significantly accelerates the denoising process by initializing
from an intermediate approximation, effectively bypassing early denoising
steps. Furthermore, recognizing that approximation may introduce
inconsistencies, we introduce a Revised Reverse Process (RRP), which adjusts
the weighting of random noise to enhance the stochasticity and mitigate
potential disharmony. We validate proposed methods on ImageNet-1K and CelebA-HQ
across multiple image restoration tasks, e.g., super-resolution, deblurring,
and compressed sensing. Our experimental results show that the proposed methods
can effectively accelerate existing methods while maintaining original
performance.

Abstract: This paper presents a portrait style transfer method that generalizes well to
various different domains while enabling high-quality semantic-aligned
stylization on regions including hair, eyes, eyelashes, skins, lips, and
background. To this end, we propose to establish dense semantic correspondence
between the given input and reference portraits based on a pre-trained model
and a semantic adapter, with which we obtain a warped reference semantically
aligned with the input. To ensure effective yet controllable style transfer, we
devise an AdaIN-Wavelet transform to balance content preservation and
stylization by blending low-frequency information of the warped reference with
high-frequency information of the input in the latent space. A style adapter is
also designed to provide style guidance from the warped reference. With the
stylized latent from AdaIN-Wavelet transform, we employ a dual-conditional
diffusion model that integrates a ControlNet recording high-frequency
information and the style guidance to generate the final result. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our code and trained
model are available at https://github.com/wangxb29/DGPST.

Conclusion: MoReMouse填补了实验室小鼠3D重建的空白，为相关研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Laboratory mice play a crucial role in biomedical research, yet accurate 3D
mouse surface motion reconstruction remains challenging due to their complex
non-rigid geometric deformations and textureless appearance. Moreover, the
absence of structured 3D datasets severely hinders the progress beyond sparse
keypoint tracking. To narrow the gap, we present MoReMouse, the first monocular
dense 3D reconstruction network tailored for laboratory mice. To achieve this
goal, we highlight three key designs. First, we construct the first
high-fidelity dense-view synthetic dataset for mice, by rendering our
self-designed realistic Gaussian mouse avatar. Second, MoReMouse adopts a
transformer-based feedforward architecture with triplane representation,
achieving high-quality 3D surface generation from a single image. Third, we
create geodesic-based continuous correspondence embeddings on mouse surface,
which serve as strong semantic priors to improve reconstruction stability and
surface consistency. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that MoReMouse significantly outperforms existing open-source
methods in accuracy and robustness. Video results are available at

Result: 在CIFAR-10等基准测试中，GSTDS计算需求降低4倍，性能不降反升，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 光谱数据选择是资源高效深度学习的可行方案，值得进一步探索自适应数据管理策略。

Abstract: Effective data curation is essential for optimizing neural network training.
In this paper, we present the Guided Spectrally Tuned Data Selection (GSTDS)
algorithm, which dynamically adjusts the subset of data points used for
training using an off-the-shelf pre-trained reference model. Based on a
pre-scheduled filtering ratio, GSTDS effectively reduces the number of data
points processed per batch. The proposed method ensures an efficient selection
of the most informative data points for training while avoiding redundant or
less beneficial computations. Preserving data points in each batch is performed
based on spectral analysis. A Fiedler vector-based scoring mechanism removes
the filtered portion of the batch, lightening the resource requirements of the
learning. The proposed data selection approach not only streamlines the
training process but also promotes improved generalization and accuracy.
Extensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks, including
CIFAR-10, Oxford-IIIT Pet, and Oxford-Flowers, demonstrate that GSTDS
outperforms standard training scenarios and JEST, a recent state-of-the-art
data curation method, on several key factors. It is shown that GSTDS achieves
notable reductions in computational requirements, up to four times, without
compromising performance. GSTDS exhibits a considerable growth in terms of
accuracy under the limited computational resource usage, in contrast to other
methodologies. These promising results underscore the potential of
spectral-based data selection as a scalable solution for resource-efficient
deep learning and motivate further exploration into adaptive data curation
strategies. You can find the code at https://github.com/rezasharifi82/GSTDS.

Conclusion: LiteIE是资源受限平台上高效实用的低光增强解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time low-light image enhancement on mobile and embedded devices requires
models that balance visual quality and computational efficiency. Existing deep
learning methods often rely on large networks and labeled datasets, limiting
their deployment on resource-constrained platforms. In this paper, we propose
LiteIE, an ultra-lightweight unsupervised enhancement framework that eliminates

convolutional layers to produce compact image features enhancement tensors. In
addition, we develop a parameter-free Iterative Restoration Module, which
reuses the extracted features to progressively recover fine details lost in
earlier enhancement steps, without introducing any additional learnable
parameters. We further propose an unsupervised training objective that
integrates exposure control, edge-aware smoothness, and multi-scale color
consistency losses. Experiments on the LOL dataset, LiteIE achieves 19.04 dB
PSNR, surpassing SOTA by 1.4 dB while using only 0.07\% of its parameters. On a
Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 mobile processor, LiteIE runs at 30 FPS for 4K images with
just 58 parameters, enabling real-time deployment on edge devices. These
results establish LiteIE as an efficient and practical solution for low-light
enhancement on resource-limited platforms.

Conclusion: SeqTex通过端到端框架直接生成高质量UV纹理贴图，显著提升了3D纹理生成的效率和效果。

Abstract: Training native 3D texture generative models remains a fundamental yet
challenging problem, largely due to the limited availability of large-scale,
high-quality 3D texture datasets. This scarcity hinders generalization to
real-world scenarios. To address this, most existing methods finetune
foundation image generative models to exploit their learned visual priors.
However, these approaches typically generate only multi-view images and rely on
post-processing to produce UV texture maps -- an essential representation in
modern graphics pipelines. Such two-stage pipelines often suffer from error
accumulation and spatial inconsistencies across the 3D surface. In this paper,
we introduce SeqTex, a novel end-to-end framework that leverages the visual
knowledge encoded in pretrained video foundation models to directly generate
complete UV texture maps. Unlike previous methods that model the distribution
of UV textures in isolation, SeqTex reformulates the task as a sequence
generation problem, enabling the model to learn the joint distribution of
multi-view renderings and UV textures. This design effectively transfers the
consistent image-space priors from video foundation models into the UV domain.
To further enhance performance, we propose several architectural innovations: a
decoupled multi-view and UV branch design, geometry-informed attention to guide
cross-domain feature alignment, and adaptive token resolution to preserve fine
texture details while maintaining computational efficiency. Together, these
components allow SeqTex to fully utilize pretrained video priors and synthesize
high-fidelity UV texture maps without the need for post-processing. Extensive
experiments show that SeqTex achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
image-conditioned and text-conditioned 3D texture generation tasks, with
superior 3D consistency, texture-geometry alignment, and real-world
generalization.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of artificial intelligence (AI) in multi-modal

However, existing benchmarks suffer from two primary limitations: (1)
Linguistic Singularity: they are largely confined to English, neglecting the

often designed for surface-level information retrieval, failing to properly
assess deep multi-modal integration. To address these limitations, we present
M3-Med, the first benchmark for Multi-lingual, Multi-modal, and Multi-hop
reasoning in Medical instructional video understanding. M3-Med consists of
medical questions paired with corresponding video segments, annotated by a team
of medical experts. A key innovation of M3-Med is its multi-hop reasoning task,
which requires a model to first locate a key entity in the text, then find
corresponding visual evidence in the video, and finally synthesize information
across both modalities to derive the answer. This design moves beyond simple
text matching and poses a substantial challenge to a model's deep cross-modal
understanding capabilities. We define two tasks: Temporal Answer Grounding in
Single Video (TAGSV) and Temporal Answer Grounding in Video Corpus (TAGVC). We
evaluated several state-of-the-art models and Large Language Models (LLMs) on
M3-Med. The results reveal a significant performance gap between all models and
human experts, especially on the complex multi-hop questions where model
performance drops sharply. M3-Med effectively highlights the current
limitations of AI models in deep cross-modal reasoning within specialized
domains and provides a new direction for future research.

TL;DR: MPQ-DMv2提出了一种改进的混合精度量化框架，用于极低比特扩散模型，解决了现有量化方法在极低比特下的性能退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在视觉生成任务中表现出色，但高计算复杂度限制了其在边缘设备上的应用。现有量化方法在极低比特（2-4位）下性能下降严重。

Method: 提出Flexible Z-Order Residual Mixed Quantization处理异常值，Object-Oriented Low-Rank Initialization优化初始化，以及Memory-based Temporal Relation Distillation保持时间一致性。

Result: 在各种生成任务上的实验表明，MPQ-DMv2在不同架构下显著优于现有方法，尤其在极低比特宽度下。

Conclusion: MPQ-DMv2通过改进量化器和优化策略，成功实现了极低比特扩散模型的高效量化，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance on vision
generation tasks. However, the high computational complexity hinders its wide
application on edge devices. Quantization has emerged as a promising technique
for inference acceleration and memory reduction. However, existing quantization
methods do not generalize well under extremely low-bit (2-4 bit) quantization.
Directly applying these methods will cause severe performance degradation. We
identify that the existing quantization framework suffers from the
outlier-unfriendly quantizer design, suboptimal initialization, and
optimization strategy. We present MPQ-DMv2, an improved \textbf{M}ixed
\textbf{P}recision \textbf{Q}uantization framework for extremely low-bit
\textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{M}odels. For the quantization perspective, the
imbalanced distribution caused by salient outliers is quantization-unfriendly
for uniform quantizer. We propose \textit{Flexible Z-Order Residual Mixed
Quantization} that utilizes an efficient binary residual branch for flexible
quant steps to handle salient error. For the optimization framework, we
theoretically analyzed the convergence and optimality of the LoRA module and
propose \textit{Object-Oriented Low-Rank Initialization} to use prior
quantization error for informative initialization. We then propose
\textit{Memory-based Temporal Relation Distillation} to construct an online
time-aware pixel queue for long-term denoising temporal information
distillation, which ensures the overall temporal consistency between quantized
and full-precision model. Comprehensive experiments on various generation tasks
show that our MPQ-DMv2 surpasses current SOTA methods by a great margin on
different architectures, especially under extremely low-bit widths.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单域泛化（SDG）任务面临域偏移大和数据多样性不足的挑战，现有方法难以适应大域偏移。

Method: 利用Lyapunov Exponent（LE）测量调整学习率，使模型在混沌边缘训练，平衡稳定性和适应性。

Result: 在PACS、OfficeHome和DomainNet上实验，LEAwareSGD显著提升泛化能力，PACS低数据场景下提升9.47%。

Conclusion: 训练在混沌边缘能有效提升SDG任务的模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Single Domain Generalization (SDG) aims to develop models capable of
generalizing to unseen target domains using only one source domain, a task
complicated by substantial domain shifts and limited data diversity. Existing
SDG approaches primarily rely on data augmentation techniques, which struggle
to effectively adapt training dynamics to accommodate large domain shifts. To
address this, we propose LEAwareSGD, a novel Lyapunov Exponent (LE)-guided
optimization approach inspired by dynamical systems theory. By leveraging LE
measurements to modulate the learning rate, LEAwareSGD encourages model
training near the edge of chaos, a critical state that optimally balances
stability and adaptability. This dynamic adjustment allows the model to explore
a wider parameter space and capture more generalizable features, ultimately
enhancing the model's generalization capability. Extensive experiments on PACS,
OfficeHome, and DomainNet demonstrate that LEAwareSGD yields substantial
generalization gains, achieving up to 9.47\% improvement on PACS in low-data
regimes. These results underscore the effectiveness of training near the edge
of chaos for enhancing model generalization capability in SDG tasks.

Motivation: 当前rPPG方法在动态夜间光照条件下的有效性未知，且缺乏相关数据集，阻碍了研究进展。

Method: 提出并发布DLCN数据集，包含98名参与者的13小时视频和生理信号数据，覆盖四种典型夜间光照场景。

Result: DLCN数据集具有高多样性和真实性，为评估算法在复杂条件下的鲁棒性提供了宝贵资源。

Conclusion: DLCN数据集和Happy-rPPG工具包的发布将推动rPPG在动态夜间光照条件下的研究。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a non-contact technique for measuring
human physiological signals. Due to its convenience and non-invasiveness, it
has demonstrated broad application potential in areas such as health monitoring
and emotion recognition. In recent years, the release of numerous public
datasets has significantly advanced the performance of rPPG algorithms under
ideal lighting conditions. However, the effectiveness of current rPPG methods
in realistic nighttime scenarios with dynamic lighting variations remains
largely unknown. Moreover, there is a severe lack of datasets specifically
designed for such challenging environments, which has substantially hindered
progress in this area of research. To address this gap, we present and release
a large-scale rPPG dataset collected under dynamic lighting conditions at
night, named DLCN. The dataset comprises approximately 13 hours of video data
and corresponding synchronized physiological signals from 98 participants,
covering four representative nighttime lighting scenarios. DLCN offers high
diversity and realism, making it a valuable resource for evaluating algorithm
robustness in complex conditions. Built upon the proposed Happy-rPPG Toolkit,
we conduct extensive experiments and provide a comprehensive analysis of the
challenges faced by state-of-the-art rPPG methods when applied to DLCN. The
dataset and code are publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种端到端框架DMAT，结合3D Mamba结构处理大气湍流（AT）引起的时空失真，同时提升图像质量和目标检测性能。


<details>

Motivation: 大气湍流导致监控图像质量下降，影响目标分类和场景跟踪，现有深度学习方法难以有效处理时空失真问题。

Method: 使用3D Mamba结构处理AT引起的时空位移和模糊，通过金字塔方式提取特征并传递给目标检测器，联合优化AT缓解器和检测器。

Result: DMAT在受湍流干扰的数据集上，比现有方法性能提升高达15%。

Conclusion: DMAT通过联合优化特征提取和目标检测，显著提升了AT干扰下的图像质量和检测精度。

Abstract: Atmospheric Turbulence (AT) degrades the clarity and accuracy of surveillance
imagery, posing challenges not only for visualization quality but also for
object classification and scene tracking. Deep learning-based methods have been
proposed to improve visual quality, but spatio-temporal distortions remain a
significant issue. Although deep learning-based object detection performs well
under normal conditions, it struggles to operate effectively on sequences
distorted by atmospheric turbulence. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework that learns to compensate for distorted features while simultaneously
improving visualization and object detection. This end-to-end framework
leverages and exchanges knowledge of low-level distorted features in the AT
mitigator with semantic features extracted in the object detector.
Specifically, in the AT mitigator a 3D Mamba-based structure is used to handle
the spatio-temporal displacements and blurring caused by turbulence. Features
are extracted in a pyramid manner during the mitigation stage and passed to the
detector. Optimization is achieved through back-propagation in both the AT
mitigator and object detector. Our proposed DMAT outperforms state-of-the-art
AT mitigation and object detection systems up to a 15% improvement on datasets
corrupted by generated turbulence.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学VQA方法忽视了CT数据的空间连续性和切片间相关性，导致回答碎片化且不精确。

Method: 构建跨模态图，将CT切片和问题标记作为节点，利用注意力图卷积网络动态融合信息，生成软提示指导LLM回答。

Result: 在M3D-VQA基准测试中，该方法在多项指标上优于基线模型，表现出更强的推理能力。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过图表示和LLM结合，显著提升了医学VQA的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Visual question answering (VQA) in medical imaging aims to support clinical
diagnosis by automatically interpreting complex imaging data in response to
natural language queries. Existing studies typically rely on distinct visual
and textual encoders to independently extract features from medical images and
clinical questions, which are subsequently combined to generate answers.
Specifically, in computed tomography (CT), such approaches are similar to the
conventional practices in medical image analysis. However, these approaches pay
less attention to the spatial continuity and inter-slice correlations in the
volumetric CT data, leading to fragmented and imprecise responses. In this
paper, we propose a novel large language model (LLM)-based framework enhanced
by a graph representation of salient features. Different from conventional
multimodal encoding strategies, our approach constructs a cross-modal graph
integrating both visual and textual features, treating individual CT slices and
question tokens as nodes within the graph. We further leverage an attentive
graph convolutional network to dynamically fuse information within this
structure. The resulting aggregated graph features then serve as a soft prompt
to guide a large language model in generating accurate answers. Extensive
experiments on the M3D-VQA benchmark demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms baselines across multiple evaluation metrics, offering more robust
reasoning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有融合策略无法同时实现高效性、长程建模和完整场景信息保留。

Method: 提出高度保真LiDAR编码和混合Mamba块，结合局部和全局上下文学习。

Result: 在nuScenes验证基准上取得75.0的NDS分数，超越高分辨率输入方法。

Conclusion: 方法在性能和效率上均达到最优，解决了多模态对齐中的高度信息丢失问题。

Abstract: We present the first work demonstrating that a pure Mamba block can achieve
efficient Dense Global Fusion, meanwhile guaranteeing top performance for
camera-LiDAR multi-modal 3D object detection. Our motivation stems from the
observation that existing fusion strategies are constrained by their inability
to simultaneously achieve efficiency, long-range modeling, and retaining
complete scene information. Inspired by recent advances in state-space models
(SSMs) and linear attention, we leverage their linear complexity and long-range
modeling capabilities to address these challenges. However, this is non-trivial
since our experiments reveal that simply adopting efficient linear-complexity
methods does not necessarily yield improvements and may even degrade
performance. We attribute this degradation to the loss of height information
during multi-modal alignment, leading to deviations in sequence order. To
resolve this, we propose height-fidelity LiDAR encoding that preserves precise
height information through voxel compression in continuous space, thereby
enhancing camera-LiDAR alignment. Subsequently, we introduce the Hybrid Mamba
Block, which leverages the enriched height-informed features to conduct local
and global contextual learning. By integrating these components, our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance with the top-tire NDS score of 75.0 on
the nuScenes validation benchmark, even surpassing methods that utilize
high-resolution inputs. Meanwhile, our method maintains efficiency, achieving
faster inference speed than most recent state-of-the-art methods.

Method: 利用视觉语言模型（VLMs）将墓碑图像转换为结构化表示（TMRs），并结合检索增强生成（RAG）技术丰富语义解析。

Result: 与传统OCR方法相比，解析准确率从F1分数36.1提升至89.5，并在多样文化和语言环境中表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究首次利用大规模视觉语言模型形式化墓碑理解，为文化遗产保护提供了新思路。

Abstract: Tombstones are historically and culturally rich artifacts, encapsulating
individual lives, community memory, historical narratives and artistic
expression. Yet, many tombstones today face significant preservation
challenges, including physical erosion, vandalism, environmental degradation,
and political shifts. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-modal framework
for tombstones digitization, aiming to improve the interpretation, organization
and retrieval of tombstone content. Our approach leverages vision-language
models (VLMs) to translate tombstone images into structured Tombstone Meaning
Representations (TMRs), capturing both image and text information. To further
enrich semantic parsing, we incorporate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
for integrate externally dependent elements such as toponyms, occupation codes,
and ontological concepts. Compared to traditional OCR-based pipelines, our
method improves parsing accuracy from an F1 score of 36.1 to 89.5. We
additionally evaluate the model's robustness across diverse linguistic and
cultural inscriptions, and simulate physical degradation through image fusion
to assess performance under noisy or damaged conditions. Our work represents
the first attempt to formalize tombstone understanding using large
vision-language models, presenting implications for heritage preservation.

Motivation: 解决自解释模型在训练时的高标注和计算成本问题，通过迁移学习实现高效的可解释性传递。

Method: 扩展基于视觉语言预训练模型的图像分类器，定义可解释性向量，并通过任务算术框架将其应用于目标领域模型。

Result: 实验表明，视觉可解释性可成功迁移，解释质量提升且分类准确性未受影响；ImageNet上学习的可解释性向量具有普适性。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且有效，单次推理的解释质量接近需要多次推理的Kernel SHAP。

Abstract: In scenarios requiring both prediction and explanation efficiency for image
classification, self-explaining models that perform both tasks in a single
inference are effective. However, their training incurs substantial labeling
and computational costs. This study aims to tackle the issue by proposing a
method to transfer the visual explainability of self-explaining models, learned
in a source domain, to a target domain based on a task arithmetic framework.
Specifically, we construct a self-explaining model by extending image
classifiers based on a vision-language pretrained model. We then define an
\emph{explainability vector} as the difference between model parameters trained
on the source domain with and without explanation supervision. Based on the
task arithmetic framework, we impart explainability to a model trained only on
the prediction task in the target domain by applying the explainability vector.
Experimental results on various image classification datasets demonstrate that,
except for transfers between some less-related domains, visual explainability
can be successfully transferred from source to target domains, improving
explanation quality in the target domain without sacrificing classification
accuracy. Furthermore, we show that the explainability vector learned on a
large and diverse dataset like ImageNet, extended with explanation supervision,
exhibits universality and robustness, improving explanation quality on nine out
of ten different target datasets. We also find that the explanation quality
achieved with a single model inference is comparable to that of Kernel SHAP,
which requires 150 model inferences.

Motivation: 现有基于信息瓶颈原理的特征归因方法仅关注单层信息，忽略了决策过程中跨层分布的证据，导致解释不全面。

Result: 实验结果表明，CoIBA显著提高了特征归因的忠实性。

Conclusion: CoIBA通过跨层信息共享和变分方法，为决策过程提供了更全面的解释。

Abstract: The feature attribution method reveals the contribution of input variables to
the decision-making process to provide an attribution map for explanation.
Existing methods grounded on the information bottleneck principle compute
information in a specific layer to obtain attributions, compressing the
features by injecting noise via a parametric damping ratio. However, the
attribution obtained in a specific layer neglects evidence of the
decision-making process distributed across layers. In this paper, we introduce
a comprehensive information bottleneck (CoIBA), which discovers the relevant
information in each targeted layer to explain the decision-making process. Our
core idea is applying information bottleneck in multiple targeted layers to
estimate the comprehensive information by sharing a parametric damping ratio
across the layers. Leveraging this shared ratio complements the over-compressed
information to discover the omitted clues of the decision by sharing the
relevant information across the targeted layers. We suggest the variational
approach to fairly reflect the relevant information of each layer by upper
bounding layer-wise information. Therefore, CoIBA guarantees that the discarded
activation is unnecessary in every targeted layer to make a decision. The
extensive experimental results demonstrate the enhancement in faithfulness of
the feature attributions provided by CoIBA.

<details>

Motivation: 跨模态遥感图像配准面临非线性辐射变化和纹理限制的挑战，现有方法（如CNN和Transformer）无法兼顾全局特征和计算效率。

Method: 采用多方向交叉扫描策略捕捉全局上下文关系，结合多专家特征学习（MEFL）策略增强纹理受限场景下的特征提取，并通过多级特征聚合（MFA）模块整合局部和全局特征。

Result: 在多种分辨率的CRSI上实验表明，RegistrationMamba在性能和鲁棒性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RegistrationMamba通过SSM和MEFL策略有效提升了CRSI配准的准确性和适应性。

Abstract: Cross-modal remote sensing image (CRSI) registration is critical for
multi-modal image applications. However, CRSI mainly faces two challenges:
significant nonlinear radiometric variations between cross-modal images and
limited textures hindering the discriminative information extraction. Existing
methods mainly adopt convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or Transformer
architectures to extract discriminative features for registration. However,
CNNs with the local receptive field fail to capture global contextual features,
and Transformers have high computational complexity and restrict their
application to high-resolution CRSI. To solve these issues, this paper proposes
RegistrationMamba, a novel Mamba architecture based on state space models
(SSMs) integrating multi-expert feature learning for improving the accuracy of
CRSI registration. Specifically, RegistrationMamba employs a multi-directional
cross-scanning strategy to capture global contextual relationships with linear
complexity. To enhance the performance of RegistrationMamba under
texture-limited scenarios, we propose a multi-expert feature learning (MEFL)
strategy to capture features from various augmented image variants through
multiple feature experts. MEFL leverages a learnable soft router to dynamically
fuse the features from multiple experts, thereby enriching feature
representations and improving registration performance. Notably, MEFL can be
seamlessly integrated into various frameworks, substantially boosting
registration performance. Additionally, RegistrationMamba integrates a
multi-level feature aggregation (MFA) module to extract fine-grained local
information and enable effective interaction between global and local features.
Extensive experiments on CRSI with varying image resolutions have demonstrated
that RegistrationMamba has superior performance and robustness compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Sat2City通过创新方法解决了3D城市生成的细节问题，为游戏、数字孪生等应用提供了新可能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have enabled 3D urban scene
generation from satellite imagery, unlocking promising applications in gaming,
digital twins, and beyond. However, most existing methods rely heavily on
neural rendering techniques, which hinder their ability to produce detailed 3D
structures on a broader scale, largely due to the inherent structural ambiguity
derived from relatively limited 2D observations. To address this challenge, we
propose Sat2City, a novel framework that synergizes the representational
capacity of sparse voxel grids with latent diffusion models, tailored
specifically for our novel 3D city dataset. Our approach is enabled by three
key components: (1) A cascaded latent diffusion framework that progressively
recovers 3D city structures from satellite imagery, (2) a Re-Hash operation at
its Variational Autoencoder (VAE) bottleneck to compute multi-scale feature
grids for stable appearance optimization and (3) an inverse sampling strategy
enabling implicit supervision for smooth appearance transitioning.To overcome
the challenge of collecting real-world city-scale 3D models with high-quality
geometry and appearance, we introduce a dataset of synthesized large-scale 3D
cities paired with satellite-view height maps. Validated on this dataset, our
framework generates detailed 3D structures from a single satellite image,
achieving superior fidelity compared to existing city generation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度估计方法需要昂贵的3D监督且泛化性差，尤其在户外无界场景中表现不佳。

Result: 在多个公共数据集上实验表明，该方法优于现有NeRF变体和深度正则化方法。

Conclusion: 视图一致分布和深度推动损失能有效消除失败模式，提升NeRF性能。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has emerged as a compelling framework for scene
representation and 3D recovery. To improve its performance on real-world data,
depth regularizations have proven to be the most effective ones. However, depth
estimation models not only require expensive 3D supervision in training, but
also suffer from generalization issues. As a result, the depth estimations can
be erroneous in practice, especially for outdoor unbounded scenes. In this
paper, we propose to employ view-consistent distributions instead of fixed
depth value estimations to regularize NeRF training. Specifically, the
distribution is computed by utilizing both low-level color features and
high-level distilled features from foundation models at the projected 2D
pixel-locations from per-ray sampled 3D points. By sampling from the
view-consistency distributions, an implicit regularization is imposed on the
training of NeRF. We also utilize a depth-pushing loss that works in
conjunction with the sampling technique to jointly provide effective
regularizations for eliminating the failure modes. Extensive experiments
conducted on various scenes from public datasets demonstrate that our proposed
method can generate significantly better novel view synthesis results than
state-of-the-art NeRF variants as well as different depth regularization
methods.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification faces challenges such as
high-dimensional data, limited training samples, and spectral redundancy, which
often lead to overfitting and insufficient generalization capability. This
paper proposes a novel MVNet network architecture that integrates 3D-CNN's
local feature extraction, Transformer's global modeling, and Mamba's linear
complexity sequence modeling capabilities, achieving efficient spatial-spectral
feature extraction and fusion. MVNet features a redesigned dual-branch Mamba
module, including a State Space Model (SSM) branch and a non-SSM branch
employing 1D convolution with SiLU activation, enhancing modeling of both
short-range and long-range dependencies while reducing computational latency in
traditional Mamba. The optimized HSI-MambaVision Mixer module overcomes the
unidirectional limitation of causal convolution, capturing bidirectional
spatial-spectral dependencies in a single forward pass through decoupled
attention that focuses on high-value features, alleviating parameter redundancy
and the curse of dimensionality. On IN, UP, and KSC datasets, MVNet outperforms
mainstream hyperspectral image classification methods in both classification
accuracy and computational efficiency, demonstrating robust capability in
processing complex HSI data.

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个大规模光谱食品（SFOOD）基准套件，填补了食品属性研究的空白，并发现光谱数据对食品属性分析至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注食品类别，缺乏对多种食品属性（如甜度、重量等）的全面基准，且RGB相机难以准确感知这些属性。

Method: 通过整合现有食品数据集并收集数百种食品的高光谱图像，结合仪器实验测定食品属性，构建了包含3,266个食品类别和2,351k数据点的基准。

Result: 大规模模型在食品数字化方面表现不佳，光谱数据对分析食品属性（如甜度）至关重要。

Conclusion: SFOOD基准将开源并持续迭代，以推动智能食品分析的发展。

Abstract: With the rise and development of computer vision and LLMs, intelligence is
everywhere, especially for people and cars. However, for tremendous food
attributes (such as origin, quantity, weight, quality, sweetness, etc.),
existing research still mainly focuses on the study of categories. The reason
is the lack of a large and comprehensive benchmark for food. Besides, many food
attributes (such as sweetness, weight, and fine-grained categories) are
challenging to accurately percept solely through RGB cameras. To fulfill this
gap and promote the development of intelligent food analysis, in this paper, we
built the first large-scale spectral food (SFOOD) benchmark suite. We spent a
lot of manpower and equipment costs to organize existing food datasets and
collect hyperspectral images of hundreds of foods, and we used instruments to
experimentally determine food attributes such as sweetness and weight. The
resulting benchmark consists of 3,266 food categories and 2,351 k data points
for 17 main food categories. Extensive evaluations find that: (i) Large-scale
models are still poor at digitizing food. Compared to people and cars, food has
gradually become one of the most difficult objects to study; (ii) Spectrum data
are crucial for analyzing food properties (such as sweetness). Our benchmark
will be open source and continuously iterated for different food analysis
tasks.

TL;DR: DreamVLA提出了一种新的视觉-语言-动作（VLA）框架，通过整合全面的世界知识预测，解决了现有方法在冗余信息和缺乏动态、空间及语义信息方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型在图像生成与动作预测结合中存在冗余信息和缺乏全面世界知识的问题，限制了机器人操作的泛化和推理能力。

Method: DreamVLA引入了动态区域引导的世界知识预测，结合空间和语义线索，并采用块状结构化注意力机制和扩散变换器来解耦信息。

Result: 在真实和仿真环境中，DreamVLA在真实机器人任务中达到76.7%的成功率，在CALVIN ABC-D基准测试中平均长度为4.44。

Conclusion: DreamVLA通过整合全面的世界知识预测和解耦表示，显著提升了机器人操作的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise in
integrating image generation with action prediction to improve generalization
and reasoning in robot manipulation. However, existing methods are limited to
challenging image-based forecasting, which suffers from redundant information
and lacks comprehensive and critical world knowledge, including dynamic,
spatial and semantic information. To address these limitations, we propose
DreamVLA, a novel VLA framework that integrates comprehensive world knowledge
forecasting to enable inverse dynamics modeling, thereby establishing a
perception-prediction-action loop for manipulation tasks. Specifically,
DreamVLA introduces a dynamic-region-guided world knowledge prediction,
integrated with the spatial and semantic cues, which provide compact yet
comprehensive representations for action planning. This design aligns with how
humans interact with the world by first forming abstract multimodal reasoning
chains before acting. To mitigate interference among the dynamic, spatial and
semantic information during training, we adopt a block-wise structured
attention mechanism that masks their mutual attention, preventing information
leakage and keeping each representation clean and disentangled. Moreover, to
model the conditional distribution over future actions, we employ a
diffusion-based transformer that disentangles action representations from
shared latent features. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulation
environments demonstrate that DreamVLA achieves 76.7% success rate on real
robot tasks and 4.44 average length on the CALVIN ABC-D benchmarks.

TL;DR: CoT-Diff通过将多模态大语言模型驱动的3D布局规划与扩散过程紧密结合，显著提升了文本到图像生成的空间对齐和组合保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型在复杂场景中难以实现输入文本与空间布局的对齐，布局规划与生成过程脱节导致优化困难。

Method: CoT-Diff框架在单次扩散过程中嵌入MLLM驱动的3D布局规划，动态更新布局并通过条件感知注意力机制注入语义和深度信息。

Result: 在3D场景基准测试中，CoT-Diff在复杂场景空间准确度上比现有最佳方法提升了34.7%。

Conclusion: CoT-Diff通过紧密耦合布局规划与生成过程，验证了这种纠缠生成范式的有效性。

Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) generation models struggle to align spatial
composition with the input text, especially in complex scenes. Even
layout-based approaches yield suboptimal spatial control, as their generation
process is decoupled from layout planning, making it difficult to refine the
layout during synthesis. We present CoT-Diff, a framework that brings
step-by-step CoT-style reasoning into T2I generation by tightly integrating
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-driven 3D layout planning with the
diffusion process. CoT-Diff enables layout-aware reasoning inline within a
single diffusion round: at each denoising step, the MLLM evaluates intermediate
predictions, dynamically updates the 3D scene layout, and continuously guides
the generation process. The updated layout is converted into semantic
conditions and depth maps, which are fused into the diffusion model via a
condition-aware attention mechanism, enabling precise spatial control and
semantic injection. Experiments on 3D Scene benchmarks show that CoT-Diff
significantly improves spatial alignment and compositional fidelity, and
outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 34.7% in complex scene spatial
accuracy, thereby validating the effectiveness of this entangled generation
paradigm.

TL;DR: BiVM是一种高效的二值化神经网络，用于视频抠图，通过弹性快捷连接和可进化拓扑结构提升编码器性能，并通过稀疏化解码器特征减少计算负担，显著优于现有方法。


<details>

Motivation: 边缘设备上的实时视频抠图因计算限制难以广泛应用，现有二值化方法存在精度和效率问题。

Method: 提出弹性快捷连接和可进化拓扑的编码器，稀疏化解码器特征，并采用信息引导的局部二值化模仿框架。

Result: BiVM在计算和存储成本上分别节省14.3倍和21.6倍，性能显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BiVM通过优化编码器和解码器设计，实现了高效且准确的二值化视频抠图。

Abstract: Deep neural networks for real-time video matting suffer significant
computational limitations on edge devices, hindering their adoption in
widespread applications such as online conferences and short-form video
production. Binarization emerges as one of the most common compression
approaches with compact 1-bit parameters and efficient bitwise operations.
However, accuracy and efficiency limitations exist in the binarized video
matting network due to its degenerated encoder and redundant decoder. Following
a theoretical analysis based on the information bottleneck principle, the
limitations are mainly caused by the degradation of prediction-relevant
information in the intermediate features and the redundant computation in
prediction-irrelevant areas. We present BiVM, an accurate and
resource-efficient Binarized neural network for Video Matting. First, we
present a series of binarized computation structures with elastic shortcuts and
evolvable topologies, enabling the constructed encoder backbone to extract
high-quality representation from input videos for accurate prediction. Second,
we sparse the intermediate feature of the binarized decoder by masking
homogeneous parts, allowing the decoder to focus on representation with diverse
details while alleviating the computation burden for efficient inference.
Furthermore, we construct a localized binarization-aware mimicking framework
with the information-guided strategy, prompting matting-related representation
in full-precision counterparts to be accurately and fully utilized.
Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed BiVM surpasses alternative
binarized video matting networks, including state-of-the-art (SOTA)
binarization methods, by a substantial margin. Moreover, our BiVM achieves
significant savings of 14.3x and 21.6x in computation and storage costs,
respectively. We also evaluate BiVM on ARM CPU hardware.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of deep learning (DL) models and the ever-increasing size
of available datasets have raised the interest of the research community in the
always important field of vision-based hand gesture recognition (VHGR), and
delivered a wide range of applications, such as sign language understanding and
human-computer interaction using cameras. Despite the large volume of research
works in the field, a structured and complete survey on VHGR is still missing,
leaving researchers to navigate through hundreds of papers in order to find the
right combination of data, model, and approach for each task. The current
survey aims to fill this gap by presenting a comprehensive overview of this
aspect of computer vision. With a systematic research methodology that
identifies the state-of-the-art works and a structured presentation of the
various methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics, this review aims to
constitute a useful guideline for researchers, helping them to choose the right
strategy for delving into a certain VHGR task. Starting with the methodology
used for study selection, literature retrieval, and the analytical framing, the
survey identifies and organizes key VHGR approaches using a taxonomy-based
format in various dimensions such as input modality and application domain. The
core of the survey provides an in-depth analysis of state-of-the-art techniques
across three primary VHGR tasks: static gesture recognition, isolated dynamic
gestures and continuous gesture recognition. For each task, the architectural
trends and learning strategies are listed. Additionally, the study reviews
commonly used datasets - emphasizing on annotation schemes - and evaluates
standard performance metrics. It concludes by identifying major challenges in
VHGR, including both general computer vision issues and domain-specific
obstacles, and outlines promising directions for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态嵌入模型（如VLM2Vec、E5-V、GME）主要针对自然图像，对其他视觉形式（如视频和视觉文档）支持有限，限制了其在实际场景中的应用。

Method: 提出VLM2Vec-V2框架，并扩展MMEB-V2基准，新增五种任务类型（如视频检索、视觉文档检索等）。

Result: VLM2Vec-V2在新任务和原有图像基准上均表现优异，验证了其通用性和改进效果。

Conclusion: VLM2Vec-V2为多模态嵌入学习提供了统一且可扩展的解决方案，为研究和实际应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multimodal embedding models have been crucial in enabling various downstream
tasks such as semantic similarity, information retrieval, and clustering over
different modalities. However, existing multimodal embeddings like VLM2Vec,
E5-V, GME are predominantly focused on natural images, with limited support for
other visual forms such as videos and visual documents. This restricts their
applicability in real-world scenarios, including AI agents, multi-modal search
and recommendation, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). To close this
gap, we propose VLM2Vec-V2, a unified framework for learning embeddings across
diverse visual forms. First, we introduce MMEB-V2, a comprehensive benchmark
that extends MMEB with five new task types: visual document retrieval, video
retrieval, temporal grounding, video classification and video question
answering - spanning text, image, video, and visual document inputs. Next, we
train VLM2Vec-V2, a general-purpose embedding model that supports text, image,
video, and visual document inputs. Extensive experiments show that VLM2Vec-V2
achieves strong performance not only on the newly introduced video and document
retrieval tasks, but also improves over prior baselines on the original image
benchmarks. Through extensive evaluation, our study offers insights into the
generalizability of various multimodal embedding models and highlights
effective strategies for unified embedding learning, laying the groundwork for
more scalable and adaptable representation learning in both research and
real-world settings.

Method: 采用三路径设计（内容、风格、生成），结合注意力干预分析，引入关键阶段注意力共享和自适应查询共享机制。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在风格保真度和提示保真度上媲美微调基线，同时推理更快、部署更灵活。

Conclusion: 通过无需训练的方法，实现了高效的个性化图像生成，为实际应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present a training-free framework for style-personalized image generation
that controls content and style information during inference using a scale-wise
autoregressive model. Our method employs a three-path design--content, style,
and generation--each guided by a corresponding text prompt, enabling flexible
and efficient control over image semantics without any additional training. A
central contribution of this work is a step-wise and attention-wise
intervention analysis. Through systematic prompt and feature injection, we find
that early-to-middle generation steps play a pivotal role in shaping both
content and style, and that query features predominantly encode
content-specific information. Guided by these insights, we introduce two
targeted mechanisms: Key Stage Attention Sharing, which aligns content and
style during the semantically critical steps, and Adaptive Query Sharing, which
reinforces content semantics in later steps through similarity-aware query
blending. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive style fidelity and prompt fidelity compared to fine-tuned
baselines, while offering faster inference and greater deployment flexibility.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频描述数据集缺乏复杂语言描述，且现有方法难以解释视觉与语言之间的关系。

Method: 采用时空事件图的共享表示，以可解释的方式连接多视觉任务生成自然语言描述，并作为自动教师训练端到端神经网络。

Result: 方法在多个数据集上生成连贯、丰富且相关的文本描述，并通过标准评估和人工验证。

Conclusion: 提出的可解释神经分析方法有效解决了视频长段落描述的生成问题。

Abstract: The task of describing video content in natural language is commonly referred
to as video captioning. Unlike conventional video captions, which are typically
brief and widely available, long-form paragraph descriptions in natural
language are scarce. This limitation of current datasets is due to the
expensive human manual annotation required and to the highly challenging task
of explaining the language formation process from the perspective of the
underlying story, as a complex system of interconnected events in space and
time. Through a thorough analysis of recently published methods and available
datasets, we identify a general lack of published resources dedicated to the
problem of describing videos in complex language, beyond the level of
descriptions in the form of enumerations of simple captions. Furthermore, while
state-of-the-art methods produce impressive results on the task of generating
shorter captions from videos by direct end-to-end learning between the videos
and text, the problem of explaining the relationship between vision and
language is still beyond our reach. In this work, we propose a shared
representation between vision and language, based on graphs of events in space
and time, which can be obtained in an explainable and analytical way, to
integrate and connect multiple vision tasks to produce the final natural
language description. Moreover, we also demonstrate how our automated and
explainable video description generation process can function as a fully
automatic teacher to effectively train direct, end-to-end neural student
pathways, within a self-supervised neuro-analytical system. We validate that
our explainable neuro-analytical approach generates coherent, rich and relevant
textual descriptions on videos collected from multiple varied datasets, using
both standard evaluation metrics, human annotations and consensus from
ensembles of state-of-the-art VLMs.

Conclusion: U-ViLAR框架通过平衡粗粒度和细粒度定位能力，实现了鲁棒且精确的定位。

Abstract: Accurate localization using visual information is a critical yet challenging
task, especially in urban environments where nearby buildings and construction
sites significantly degrade GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) signal
quality. This issue underscores the importance of visual localization
techniques in scenarios where GNSS signals are unreliable. This paper proposes
U-ViLAR, a novel uncertainty-aware visual localization framework designed to
address these challenges while enabling adaptive localization using
high-definition (HD) maps or navigation maps. Specifically, our method first
extracts features from the input visual data and maps them into Bird's-Eye-View
(BEV) space to enhance spatial consistency with the map input. Subsequently, we
introduce: a) Perceptual Uncertainty-guided Association, which mitigates errors
caused by perception uncertainty, and b) Localization Uncertainty-guided
Registration, which reduces errors introduced by localization uncertainty. By
effectively balancing the coarse-grained large-scale localization capability of
association with the fine-grained precise localization capability of
registration, our approach achieves robust and accurate localization.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple localization tasks. Furthermore, our model has
undergone rigorous testing on large-scale autonomous driving fleets and has
demonstrated stable performance in various challenging urban scenarios.

Conclusion: MVL-Loc通过结合视觉语言模型和多模态数据，显著提升了多场景相机重定位的泛化能力和准确性。

Abstract: Camera relocalization, a cornerstone capability of modern computer vision,
accurately determines a camera's position and orientation (6-DoF) from images
and is essential for applications in augmented reality (AR), mixed reality
(MR), autonomous driving, delivery drones, and robotic navigation. Unlike
traditional deep learning-based methods that regress camera pose from images in
a single scene, which often lack generalization and robustness in diverse
environments, we propose MVL-Loc, a novel end-to-end multi-scene 6-DoF camera
relocalization framework. MVL-Loc leverages pretrained world knowledge from
vision-language models (VLMs) and incorporates multimodal data to generalize
across both indoor and outdoor settings. Furthermore, natural language is
employed as a directive tool to guide the multi-scene learning process,
facilitating semantic understanding of complex scenes and capturing spatial
relationships among objects. Extensive experiments on the 7Scenes and Cambridge
Landmarks datasets demonstrate MVL-Loc's robustness and state-of-the-art
performance in real-world multi-scene camera relocalization, with improved

Motivation: 解决MLLMs在开放视觉问答中的幻觉问题，提升输出的一致性和可靠性。

Method: 提出ReLoop框架，整合语义重建、视觉描述和注意力监督模块，实现多模态一致性反馈。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著降低幻觉率。

Conclusion: ReLoop为MLLMs中的幻觉问题提供了一种有效的内部验证机制。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in open-ended visual question answering, they remain vulnerable to
hallucinations. These are outputs that contradict or misrepresent input
semantics, posing a critical challenge to the reliability and factual
consistency. Existing methods often rely on external verification or post-hoc
correction, lacking an internal mechanism to validate outputs directly during
training. To bridge this gap, we propose ReLoop, a unified closed-loop training
framework that encourages multimodal consistency for cross-modal understanding
in MLLMs. ReLoop adopts a ring-shaped structure that integrates three
complementary consistency feedback mechanisms, obliging MLLMs to "seeing twice
and thinking backwards". Specifically, ReLoop employs the frozen Consistency
Feedback Plugin (CFP), comprising semantic reconstruction, visual description,
and an attention supervision module for attention alignment. These components
collectively enforce semantic reversibility, visual consistency, and
interpretable attention, enabling the model to correct its outputs during
training. Extensive evaluations and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of
ReLoop in reducing hallucination rates across multiple benchmarks, establishing
a robust method for hallucination mitigation in MLLMs. We will release our
source code and data in the camera-ready version.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于CLIP的框架FA，通过强制提示学习提升OOD检测效果，无需外部数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP方法依赖外部数据或泛化能力有限，FA旨在充分利用ID知识改进OOD检测。

Method: 学习包含更多ID类描述的强制提示，通过强制系数增强语义相似性。

Result: 在无需外部数据的情况下，FA显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FA框架有效提升了OOD检测性能，且参数效率高。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced out-of-distribution
(OOD) detection recently. However, existing CLIP-based methods often focus on
learning OOD-related knowledge to improve OOD detection, showing limited
generalization or reliance on external large-scale auxiliary datasets. In this
study, instead of delving into the intricate OOD-related knowledge, we propose
an innovative CLIP-based framework based on Forced prompt leArning (FA),
designed to make full use of the In-Distribution (ID) knowledge and ultimately
boost the effectiveness of OOD detection. Our key insight is to learn a prompt
(i.e., forced prompt) that contains more diversified and richer descriptions of
the ID classes beyond the textual semantics of class labels. Specifically, it
promotes better discernment for ID images, by forcing more notable semantic
similarity between ID images and the learnable forced prompt. Moreover, we
introduce a forced coefficient, encouraging the forced prompt to learn more
comprehensive and nuanced descriptions of the ID classes. In this way, FA is
capable of achieving notable improvements in OOD detection, even when trained
without any external auxiliary datasets, while maintaining an identical number
of trainable parameters as CoOp. Extensive empirical evaluations confirm our
method consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种认知启发的视角，将文本到图像（T2I）扩散模型中的“幻觉”重新解释为潜在对齐空间中的轨迹漂移，并引入了对齐风险代码（ARC）和TensionModulator（TM-ARC）来减少幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管T2I扩散模型在图像质量和提示保真度上取得了显著进展，但仍存在与提示语义不一致的“幻觉”问题。作者认为这些失败反映了生成过程中更深层次的结构性偏差。

Method: 论文提出了一个三轴空间（Hallucination Tri-Space），包括语义连贯性、结构对齐和知识基础，并开发了ARC和TM-ARC来实时量化和干预对齐张力。

Result: 实验表明，TM-ARC显著减少了幻觉，同时保持了图像质量和多样性。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解和缓解T2I系统中的生成失败提供了统一且可解释的方法。

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in image quality and prompt fidelity,
text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models continue to exhibit persistent
"hallucinations", where generated content subtly or significantly diverges from
the intended prompt semantics. While often regarded as unpredictable artifacts,
we argue that these failures reflect deeper, structured misalignments within
the generative process. In this work, we propose a cognitively inspired
perspective that reinterprets hallucinations as trajectory drift within a
latent alignment space. Empirical observations reveal that generation unfolds
within a multiaxial cognitive tension field, where the model must continuously
negotiate competing demands across three key critical axes: semantic coherence,
structural alignment, and knowledge grounding. We then formalize this
three-axis space as the \textbf{Hallucination Tri-Space} and introduce the
Alignment Risk Code (ARC): a dynamic vector representation that quantifies
real-time alignment tension during generation. The magnitude of ARC captures
overall misalignment, its direction identifies the dominant failure axis, and
its imbalance reflects tension asymmetry. Based on this formulation, we develop
the TensionModulator (TM-ARC): a lightweight controller that operates entirely
in latent space. TM-ARC monitors ARC signals and applies targeted,
axis-specific interventions during the sampling process. Extensive experiments
on standard T2I benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces
hallucination without compromising image quality or diversity. This framework
offers a unified and interpretable approach for understanding and mitigating
generative failures in diffusion-based T2I systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合空间基础和多模态数据的框架，用于生成具有上下文感知的手势动作，填补了现有研究在空间基础手势生成上的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型通常专注于描述性动作生成或孤立的手势合成，忽略了动作与环境基础的联系，限制了具身交互代理的发展。

Method: 论文引入了一个多模态数据集和框架，结合合成数据集和VR对话数据集，提供同步的动作、语音和3D场景信息，并连接到物理模拟器进行数据生成和评估。

Result: 提供了7.7小时的标准化数据，建立了手势建模与空间基础之间的联系。

Conclusion: 该研究为空间基础手势生成和多模态交互研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Human motion generation has advanced rapidly in recent years, yet the
critical problem of creating spatially grounded, context-aware gestures has
been largely overlooked. Existing models typically specialize either in
descriptive motion generation, such as locomotion and object interaction, or in
isolated co-speech gesture synthesis aligned with utterance semantics. However,
both lines of work often treat motion and environmental grounding separately,
limiting advances toward embodied, communicative agents. To address this gap,
our work introduces a multimodal dataset and framework for grounded gesture
generation, combining two key resources: (1) a synthetic dataset of spatially
grounded referential gestures, and (2) MM-Conv, a VR-based dataset capturing
two-party dialogues. Together, they provide over 7.7 hours of synchronized
motion, speech, and 3D scene information, standardized in the HumanML3D format.
Our framework further connects to a physics-based simulator, enabling synthetic
data generation and situated evaluation. By bridging gesture modeling and
spatial grounding, our contribution establishes a foundation for advancing
research in situated gesture generation and grounded multimodal interaction.

*Eunseop Yoon,Hee Suk Yoon,Mark A. Hasegawa-Johnson,Chang D. Yoo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为"alignment for answerability"的框架，旨在提升Video-LLMs在评估问题相关性并拒绝超出视频范围问题的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Video-LLMs主要基于视频内容生成问题训练，但在实际场景中，用户常提出超出视频信息范围的问题，模型缺乏评估问题相关性的能力。

Method: 提出了一种框架，使Video-LLMs能评估问题相关性并拒绝不相关问题；同时设计了评估指标和数据集构建流程。

Result: 研究表明，即使性能最佳的Video-LLMs也无法拒绝不相关问题，新框架能有效解决这一问题。

Conclusion: 通过"alignment for answerability"框架，Video-LLMs能更好地处理超出视频范围的问题，提升实用性。

Abstract: In the broader context of deep learning, Multimodal Large Language Models
have achieved significant breakthroughs by leveraging powerful Large Language
Models as a backbone to align different modalities into the language space. A
prime exemplification is the development of Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs). While numerous advancements have been proposed to enhance the
video understanding capabilities of these models, they are predominantly
trained on questions generated directly from video content. However, in
real-world scenarios, users often pose questions that extend beyond the
informational scope of the video, highlighting the need for Video-LLMs to
assess the relevance of the question. We demonstrate that even the
best-performing Video-LLMs fail to reject unfit questions-not necessarily due
to a lack of video understanding, but because they have not been trained to
identify and refuse such questions. To address this limitation, we propose
alignment for answerability, a framework that equips Video-LLMs with the
ability to evaluate the relevance of a question based on the input video and
appropriately decline to answer when the question exceeds the scope of the
video, as well as an evaluation framework with a comprehensive set of metrics
designed to measure model behavior before and after alignment. Furthermore, we
present a pipeline for creating a dataset specifically tailored for alignment
for answerability, leveraging existing video-description paired datasets.

*Philipp Reis,Joshua Ransiek,David Petri,Jacob Langner,Eric Sax*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于对象级新颖性检测的实时数据选择方法，用于构建更平衡和多样化的自动驾驶感知数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的数据收集往往偏向常见场景和对象，导致新颖案例代表性不足，影响模型泛化能力和安全性。

Method: 使用动态Mean Shift算法为图像帧分配数据驱动的新颖性评分，基于均值和协方差统计建模正常内容，识别并丢弃冗余帧。

Result: 减少训练数据集大小可提升模型性能，而数据冗余增加时，更积极的过滤方法更有效。

Conclusion: 该方法支持实时部署，通过持续更新正常内容的定义，高效检测连续数据流中的新颖性。

Abstract: High-quality datasets are essential for training robust perception systems in
autonomous driving. However, real-world data collection is often biased toward
common scenes and objects, leaving novel cases underrepresented. This imbalance
hinders model generalization and compromises safety. The core issue is the
curse of rarity. Over time, novel events occur infrequently, and standard
logging methods fail to capture them effectively. As a result, large volumes of
redundant data are stored, while critical novel cases are diluted, leading to
biased datasets. This work presents a real-time data selection method focused
on object-level novelty detection to build more balanced and diverse datasets.
The method assigns a data-driven novelty score to image frames using a novel
dynamic Mean Shift algorithm. It models normal content based on mean and
covariance statistics to identify frames with novel objects, discarding those
with redundant elements. The main findings show that reducing the training
dataset size with this method can improve model performance, whereas higher
redundancy tends to degrade it. Moreover, as data redundancy increases, more
aggressive filtering becomes both possible and beneficial. While random
sampling can offer some gains, it often leads to overfitting and
unpredictability in outcomes. The proposed method supports real-time deployment
with 32 frames per second and is constant over time. By continuously updating
the definition of normal content, it enables efficient detection of novelties
in a continuous data stream.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学数据集常因样本不平衡和隐私限制导致机器学习模型性能不佳，合成图像可改善数据可用性并保护隐私。

Method: 使用LoRA权重微调的稳定扩散模型生成合成白细胞图像，结合少量真实样本指导，训练ResNet和CLIP分类器。

Result: 添加合成图像后，ResNet分类器准确率从27.3%提升至78.4%，CLIP分类器从61.8%提升至76.8%。

Conclusion: 合成图像能有效克服数据集限制，提升模型泛化能力，为生物医学研究和诊断提供新工具。

Abstract: Biomedical datasets often contain a large sample imbalance and are subject to
strict privacy constraints, which together hinder the development of accurate
machine learning models. One potential solution is to generate synthetic
images, as this can improve data availability while preserving patient privacy.
However, it remains difficult to generate synthetic images of sufficient
quality for training robust classifiers. In this work, we focus on the
classification of single white blood cells, a key component in the diagnosis of
hematological diseases such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a severe blood
cancer. We demonstrate how synthetic images generated with a fine-tuned stable
diffusion model using LoRA weights when guided by real few-shot samples of the
target white blood cell classes, can enhance classifier performance for limited
data. When training a ResNet classifier, accuracy increased from 27.3\% to
78.4\% (+51.1\%) by adding 5000 synthetic images per class to a small and
highly imbalanced real dataset. For a CLIP-based classifier, the accuracy
improved from 61.8\% to 76.8\% (+15.0\%). The synthetic images are highly
similar to real images, and they can help overcome dataset limitations,
enhancing model generalization. Our results establish synthetic images as a
tool in biomedical research, improving machine learning models, and
facilitating medical diagnosis and research.

Abstract: Discrete video tokenization is essential for efficient autoregressive

contributions. First, we propose a novel Mamba-based encoder-decoder
architecture that overcomes the limitations of previous sequencebased
tokenizers. Second, we introduce a new quantization scheme, channel-split
quantization, which significantly enhances the representational power of
quantized latents while preserving the token count. Our model sets a new
state-of-the-art, outperforming both causal 3D convolutionbased and
Transformer-based approaches across multiple datasets. Experimental results
further demonstrate its robustness as a tokenizer for autoregressive video
generation.

Motivation: 历史文档因年代久远而受损严重，现有修复方法多为单模态或小规模修复，无法满足实际需求。

Method: AutoHDR采用三阶段方法：OCR辅助损伤定位、视觉语言上下文文本预测和块自回归外观修复。

Result: AutoHDR显著提升了OCR准确率，严重受损文档的准确率从46.83%提升至84.05%，人机协作下可达94.25%。

Conclusion: 该工作推动了自动化历史文档修复的发展，对文化遗产保护具有重要意义。

Abstract: Historical documents represent an invaluable cultural heritage, yet have
undergone significant degradation over time through tears, water erosion, and
oxidation. Existing Historical Document Restoration (HDR) methods primarily
focus on single modality or limited-size restoration, failing to meet practical
needs. To fill this gap, we present a full-page HDR dataset (FPHDR) and a novel
automated HDR solution (AutoHDR). Specifically, FPHDR comprises 1,633 real and
6,543 synthetic images with character-level and line-level locations, as well
as character annotations in different damage grades. AutoHDR mimics historians'
restoration workflows through a three-stage approach: OCR-assisted damage
localization, vision-language context text prediction, and patch autoregressive
appearance restoration. The modular architecture of AutoHDR enables seamless
human-machine collaboration, allowing for flexible intervention and
optimization at each restoration stage. Experiments demonstrate AutoHDR's
remarkable performance in HDR. When processing severely damaged documents, our
method improves OCR accuracy from 46.83\% to 84.05\%, with further enhancement
to 94.25\% through human-machine collaboration. We believe this work represents
a significant advancement in automated historical document restoration and
contributes substantially to cultural heritage preservation. The model and

TL;DR: S$^2$Edit是一种基于预训练扩散模型的新方法，通过可学习文本标记和空间控制实现个性化图像编辑，解决了现有方法在细粒度控制中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在细粒度编辑任务（如人脸编辑）中常导致身份信息丢失或无关区域改变，需要更精确的语义和空间控制。

Method: 通过微调模型将身份信息嵌入可学习文本标记，并使用正交约束和对象掩码实现语义解耦和空间聚焦。

Result: 实验表明S$^2$Edit在定量和定性上优于现有方法，并能应用于组合编辑任务（如妆容迁移）。

Conclusion: S$^2$Edit通过解耦和空间控制实现了高质量、个性化的图像编辑。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality generation and
manipulation of images guided by texts, as well as concept learning from
images. However, naive applications of existing methods to editing tasks that
require fine-grained control, e.g., face editing, often lead to suboptimal
solutions with identity information and high-frequency details lost during the
editing process, or irrelevant image regions altered due to entangled concepts.
In this work, we propose S$^2$Edit, a novel method based on a pre-trained
text-to-image diffusion model that enables personalized editing with precise
semantic and spatial control. We first fine-tune our model to embed the
identity information into a learnable text token. During fine-tuning, we
disentangle the learned identity token from attributes to be edited by
enforcing an orthogonality constraint in the textual feature space. To ensure
that the identity token only affects regions of interest, we apply object masks
to guide the cross-attention maps. At inference time, our method performs
localized editing while faithfully preserving the original identity with
semantically disentangled and spatially focused identity token learned.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of S$^2$Edit over
state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Additionally,
we showcase several compositional image editing applications of S$^2$Edit such
as makeup transfer.

Motivation: 探索如何将大型语言模型的推理能力迁移到多模态大语言模型（MLLMs），以解锁高级视觉推理能力。

Method: 采用两阶段范式：1）大规模语言冷启动微调；2）多模态强化学习（RL），覆盖近1000步训练。

Result: 模型Open-Vision-Reasoner（OVR）在MATH500、MathVision和MathVerse等基准测试中表现优异，分别达到95.3%、51.8%和54.6%的准确率。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了行为迁移的早期出现、冷启动与RL的作用差异以及高效用行为的偏好，为开发更强大的多模态推理模型提供了基础。

Abstract: The remarkable reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) stems
from cognitive behaviors that emerge through reinforcement with verifiable
rewards. This work investigates how to transfer this principle to Multimodal
LLMs (MLLMs) to unlock advanced visual reasoning. We introduce a two-stage
paradigm built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B: a massive linguistic cold-start fine-tuning,
followed by multimodal reinforcement learning (RL) spanning nearly 1,000 steps,
surpassing all previous open-source efforts in scale. This pioneering work
reveals three fundamental insights: 1) Behavior transfer emerges surprisingly
early in cold start due to linguistic mental imagery. 2) Cold start broadly
memorizes visual behaviors, while RL critically discerns and scales up
effective patterns. 3) Transfer strategically favors high-utility behaviors
such as visual reflection. Our resulting model, Open-Vision-Reasoner (OVR),
achieves state-of-the-art performance on a suite of reasoning benchmarks,
including 95.3% on MATH500, 51.8% on MathVision and 54.6% on MathVerse. We
release our model, data, and training dynamics to catalyze the development of
more capable, behavior-aligned multimodal reasoners.

Conclusion: CVFusion通过跨视图融合和多阶段优化，显著提升了4D雷达的3D物体检测性能。

Abstract: 4D radar has received significant attention in autonomous driving thanks to
its robustness under adverse weathers. Due to the sparse points and noisy
measurements of the 4D radar, most of the research finish the 3D object
detection task by integrating images from camera and perform modality fusion in
BEV space. However, the potential of the radar and the fusion mechanism is
still largely unexplored, hindering the performance improvement. In this study,
we propose a cross-view two-stage fusion network called CVFusion. In the first
stage, we design a radar guided iterative (RGIter) BEV fusion module to
generate high-recall 3D proposal boxes. In the second stage, we aggregate
features from multiple heterogeneous views including points, image, and BEV for
each proposal. These comprehensive instance level features greatly help refine
the proposals and generate high-quality predictions. Extensive experiments on
public datasets show that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art
methods by a large margin, with 9.10% and 3.68% mAP improvements on
View-of-Delft (VoD) and TJ4DRadSet, respectively. Our code will be made

Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在结合多个LoRA模型时，常因权重矩阵的非结构化修改导致内容与风格属性特征纠缠，影响效果。

Method: 通过QR分解，固定Q和R矩阵，仅训练额外的任务特定ΔR矩阵，实现结构化参数更新。

Result: 实验表明，QR-LoRA在内容-风格融合任务中实现了更好的解耦效果，且参数数量仅为传统LoRA方法的一半。

Conclusion: QR-LoRA为生成模型提供了一种参数高效、解耦的微调新范式。

Abstract: Existing text-to-image models often rely on parameter fine-tuning techniques
such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to customize visual attributes. However,
when combining multiple LoRA models for content-style fusion tasks,
unstructured modifications of weight matrices often lead to undesired feature
entanglement between content and style attributes. We propose QR-LoRA, a novel
fine-tuning framework leveraging QR decomposition for structured parameter
updates that effectively separate visual attributes. Our key insight is that
the orthogonal Q matrix naturally minimizes interference between different
visual features, while the upper triangular R matrix efficiently encodes
attribute-specific transformations. Our approach fixes both Q and R matrices
while only training an additional task-specific $\Delta R$ matrix. This
structured design reduces trainable parameters to half of conventional LoRA
methods and supports effective merging of multiple adaptations without
cross-contamination due to the strong disentanglement properties between
$\Delta R$ matrices. Experiments demonstrate that QR-LoRA achieves superior
disentanglement in content-style fusion tasks, establishing a new paradigm for
parameter-efficient, disentangled fine-tuning in generative models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖稀疏的幻灯片级标签，难以从千兆像素WSI中学习判别性表示，且现有VL模型在生存预测中未充分探索。

Method: HiLa框架使用预训练特征提取器生成分层的视觉特征，并通过最优提示学习（OPL）将多级语言提示与视觉特征对齐，同时引入CLP和MCL模块促进层级协作。

Result: 在三个TCGA数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: HiLa框架通过分层视觉语言协作显著提升了生存预测的准确性。

Abstract: Survival prediction using whole-slide images (WSIs) is crucial in cancer
re-search. Despite notable success, existing approaches are limited by their
reliance on sparse slide-level labels, which hinders the learning of
discriminative repre-sentations from gigapixel WSIs. Recently, vision language
(VL) models, which incorporate additional language supervision, have emerged as
a promising solu-tion. However, VL-based survival prediction remains largely
unexplored due to two key challenges. First, current methods often rely on only
one simple lan-guage prompt and basic cosine similarity, which fails to learn
fine-grained associ-ations between multi-faceted linguistic information and
visual features within WSI, resulting in inadequate vision-language alignment.
Second, these methods primarily exploit patch-level information, overlooking
the intrinsic hierarchy of WSIs and their interactions, causing ineffective
modeling of hierarchical interac-tions. To tackle these problems, we propose a
novel Hierarchical vision-Language collaboration (HiLa) framework for improved
survival prediction. Specifically, HiLa employs pretrained feature extractors
to generate hierarchical visual features from WSIs at both patch and region
levels. At each level, a series of language prompts describing various
survival-related attributes are constructed and aligned with visual features
via Optimal Prompt Learning (OPL). This ap-proach enables the comprehensive
learning of discriminative visual features cor-responding to different
survival-related attributes from prompts, thereby improv-ing vision-language
alignment. Furthermore, we introduce two modules, i.e., Cross-Level Propagation
(CLP) and Mutual Contrastive Learning (MCL) to maximize hierarchical
cooperation by promoting interactions and consistency be-tween patch and region
levels. Experiments on three TCGA datasets demonstrate our SOTA performance.

Result: 实验显示模型性能提升，训练成本减半。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了误导性标注问题，显著提升了3D视觉问答的效率和准确性。

Abstract: 3D Visual Question Answering (3D VQA) is crucial for enabling models to
perceive the physical world and perform spatial reasoning. In 3D VQA, the
free-form nature of answers often leads to improper annotations that can
confuse or mislead models when training on the entire dataset. While other text
generation tasks can mitigate this issue by learning on large-scale datasets,
the scarcity of 3D scene data enlarges the negative effect of misleading
annotations. Although active learning strategies can select valuable instances
for training, they fail to identify and resolve misleading labels, which the
oracle inevitably provides in practice. To address this issue, we propose a
multi-turn interactive active learning strategy. This strategy selects data
based on models' semantic uncertainty to form a solid knowledge foundation more
effectively and actively requests reannotation from an oracle to resolve
potentially misleading labels. For uncertainty assessment, we utilize a
variance-based metric that takes semantic relationships between terms into
consideration, thus avoiding the uniform inter-class similarity assumption of
previous assessment metrics. Extensive experiments exhibit better model
performance and a substantial reduction in training costs, with a halving of
training costs for achieving relatively high accuracy. The code is available at

Conclusion: SMoEStereo通过高效整合VFMs，显著提升了立体匹配的跨域鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recently, learning-based stereo matching networks have advanced
significantly. However, they often lack robustness and struggle to achieve
impressive cross-domain performance due to domain shifts and imbalanced
disparity distributions among diverse datasets. Leveraging Vision Foundation
Models (VFMs) can intuitively enhance the model's robustness, but integrating
such a model into stereo matching cost-effectively to fully realize their
robustness remains a key challenge. To address this, we propose SMoEStereo, a
novel framework that adapts VFMs for stereo matching through a tailored,
scene-specific fusion of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) modules. SMoEStereo introduces MoE-LoRA with adaptive ranks and
MoE-Adapter with adaptive kernel sizes. The former dynamically selects optimal
experts within MoE to adapt varying scenes across domains, while the latter
injects inductive bias into frozen VFMs to improve geometric feature
extraction. Importantly, to mitigate computational overhead, we further propose
a lightweight decision network that selectively activates MoE modules based on
input complexity, balancing efficiency with accuracy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method exhibits state-of-the-art cross-domain and joint
generalization across multiple benchmarks without dataset-specific adaptation.

Conclusion: LTMSformer在减少模型规模的同时，显著提升了轨迹预测的准确性和效率。

Abstract: It has been challenging to model the complex temporal-spatial dependencies
between agents for trajectory prediction. As each state of an agent is closely
related to the states of adjacent time steps, capturing the local temporal
dependency is beneficial for prediction, while most studies often overlook it.
Besides, learning the high-order motion state attributes is expected to enhance
spatial interaction modeling, but it is rarely seen in previous works. To
address this, we propose a lightweight framework, LTMSformer, to extract
temporal-spatial interaction features for multi-modal trajectory prediction.
Specifically, we introduce a Local Trend-Aware Attention mechanism to capture
the local temporal dependency by leveraging a convolutional attention mechanism
with hierarchical local time boxes. Next, to model the spatial interaction
dependency, we build a Motion State Encoder to incorporate high-order motion
state attributes, such as acceleration, jerk, heading, etc. To further refine
the trajectory prediction, we propose a Lightweight Proposal Refinement Module
that leverages Multi-Layer Perceptrons for trajectory embedding and generates
the refined trajectories with fewer model parameters. Experiment results on the
Argoverse 1 dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline
HiVT-64, reducing the minADE by approximately 4.35%, the minFDE by 8.74%, and
the MR by 20%. We also achieve higher accuracy than HiVT-128 with a 68%
reduction in model size.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多关注语言中心调优，忽视多模态令牌混合，导致高级任务中细粒度认知和情感理解的挑战。

Method: 提出MODA机制，采用对齐后修正策略，分离模态对齐与跨层令牌混合，并通过自适应掩码注意力确保注意力分数正确性。

Result: 在21个基准数据集上的实验验证了MODA在感知、认知和情感任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: MODA通过改进跨模态注意力机制，显著提升了多模态大语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) recently showed strong capacity in
integrating data among multiple modalities, empowered by a generalizable
attention architecture. Advanced methods predominantly focus on
language-centric tuning while less exploring multimodal tokens mixed through
attention, posing challenges in high-level tasks that require fine-grained
cognition and emotion understanding. In this work, we identify the attention
deficit disorder problem in multimodal learning, caused by inconsistent
cross-modal attention and layer-by-layer decayed attention activation. To
address this, we propose a novel attention mechanism, termed MOdular Duplex
Attention (MODA), simultaneously conducting the inner-modal refinement and
inter-modal interaction. MODA employs a correct-after-align strategy to
effectively decouple modality alignment from cross-layer token mixing. In the
alignment phase, tokens are mapped to duplex modality spaces based on the basis
vectors, enabling the interaction between visual and language modality.
Further, the correctness of attention scores is ensured through adaptive masked
attention, which enhances the model's flexibility by allowing customizable
masking patterns for different modalities. Extensive experiments on 21
benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of MODA in perception, cognition,
and emotion tasks. Source code and demo are available in

Result: 在五个多模态对象ReID数据集上的实验表明，UGG-ReID在噪声免疫方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UGG-ReID通过不确定性建模有效提升了多模态对象ReID的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal object Re-IDentification (ReID) has gained considerable attention
with the goal of retrieving specific targets across cameras using heterogeneous
visual data sources. Existing methods primarily aim to improve identification
performance, but often overlook the uncertainty arising from inherent defects,
such as intra-modal noise and inter-modal conflicts. This uncertainty is
particularly significant in the case of fine-grained local occlusion and frame
loss, which becomes a challenge in multi-modal learning. To address the above
challenge, we propose a robust approach named Uncertainty-Guided Graph model
for multi-modal object ReID (UGG-ReID). UGG-ReID is designed to mitigate noise
interference and facilitate effective multi-modal fusion by estimating both
local and sample-level aleatoric uncertainty and explicitly modeling their
dependencies. Specifically, we first propose the Gaussian patch-graph
representation model that leverages uncertainty to quantify fine-grained local
cues and capture their structural relationships. This process boosts the
expressiveness of modal-specific information, ensuring that the generated
embeddings are both more informative and robust. Subsequently, we design an
uncertainty-guided mixture of experts strategy that dynamically routes samples
to experts exhibiting low uncertainty. This strategy effectively suppresses
noise-induced instability, leading to enhanced robustness. Meanwhile, we design
an uncertainty-guided routing to strengthen the multi-modal interaction,
improving the performance. UGG-ReID is comprehensively evaluated on five
representative multi-modal object ReID datasets, encompassing diverse spectral
modalities. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves
excellent performance on all datasets and is significantly better than current
methods in terms of noise immunity. Our code will be made public upon
acceptance.

Conclusion: VectorLLM为遥感图像中的矢量提取提供了新范式，兼具高精度和强泛化能力，代码和权重将开源以促进社区发展。

Abstract: Automatically extracting vectorized building contours from remote sensing
imagery is crucial for urban planning, population estimation, and disaster
assessment. Current state-of-the-art methods rely on complex multi-stage
pipelines involving pixel segmentation, vectorization, and polygon refinement,
which limits their scalability and real-world applicability. Inspired by the
remarkable reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce
VectorLLM, the first Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) designed for
regular building contour extraction from remote sensing images. Unlike existing
approaches, VectorLLM performs corner-point by corner-point regression of
building contours directly, mimicking human annotators' labeling process. Our
architecture consists of a vision foundation backbone, an MLP connector, and an
LLM, enhanced with learnable position embeddings to improve spatial
understanding capability. Through comprehensive exploration of training
strategies including pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and preference
optimization across WHU, WHU-Mix, and CrowdAI datasets, VectorLLM significantly
outperformed the previous SOTA methods by 5.6 AP, 7.1 AP, 13.6 AP, respectively
in the three datasets. Remarkably, VectorLLM exhibits strong zero-shot
performance on unseen objects including aircraft, water bodies, and oil tanks,
highlighting its potential for unified modeling of diverse remote sensing
object contour extraction tasks. Overall, this work establishes a new paradigm
for vector extraction in remote sensing, leveraging the topological reasoning
capabilities of LLMs to achieve both high accuracy and exceptional
generalization. All the codes and weights will be published for promoting
community development.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AVATAR提出了一种视频中心的音频-视觉定位基准，解决了现有方法忽略时间动态和简化场景的问题。TAVLO模型通过高分辨率时间建模，实现了更精确的音频-视觉对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究仅关注图像级音频-视觉关联，忽略了时间动态，且假设场景过于简化（如单一可见声源）。

Method: 提出AVATAR基准，包含四种场景（单声、混合声、多实体、屏外），并开发了TAVLO模型，整合高分辨率时间信息。

Result: 传统方法因依赖全局音频特征和帧级映射而难以跟踪时间变化，TAVLO则表现更优。

Conclusion: 时间动态对AVL至关重要，AVATAR和TAVLO为视频中心音频-视觉定位设立了新标准。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Localization (AVL) aims to identify sound-emitting sources
within a visual scene. However, existing studies focus on image-level
audio-visual associations, failing to capture temporal dynamics. Moreover, they
assume simplified scenarios where sound sources are always visible and involve
only a single object. To address these limitations, we propose AVATAR, a
video-centric AVL benchmark that incorporates high-resolution temporal
information. AVATAR introduces four distinct scenarios -- Single-sound,
Mixed-sound, Multi-entity, and Off-screen -- enabling a more comprehensive
evaluation of AVL models. Additionally, we present TAVLO, a novel video-centric
AVL model that explicitly integrates temporal information. Experimental results
show that conventional methods struggle to track temporal variations due to
their reliance on global audio features and frame-level mappings. In contrast,
TAVLO achieves robust and precise audio-visual alignment by leveraging
high-resolution temporal modeling. Our work empirically demonstrates the
importance of temporal dynamics in AVL and establishes a new standard for
video-centric audio-visual localization.

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative methods, especially diffusion models, have
made great progress in remote sensing image synthesis. Despite these
advancements, existing methods have not explored the simulation of future
scenarios based on given scenario images. This simulation capability has wide
applications for urban planning, land managementChangeBridge: Spatiotemporal
Image Generation with Multimodal Controls, and beyond. In this work, we propose
ChangeBridge, a conditional spatiotemporal diffusion model. Given pre-event
images and conditioned on multimodal spatial controls (e.g., text prompts,
instance layouts, and semantic maps), ChangeBridge can synthesize post-event
images. The core idea behind ChangeBridge is to modeling the noise-to-image
diffusion model, as a pre-to-post diffusion bridge. Conditioned on multimodal
controls, ChangeBridge leverages a stochastic Brownian-bridge diffusion,
directly modeling the spatiotemporal evolution between pre-event and post-event
states. To the best of our knowledge, ChangeBridge is the first spatiotemporal
generative model with multimodal controls for remote sensing. Experimental
results demonstrate that ChangeBridge can simulate high-fidelity future
scenarios aligned with given conditions, including event and event-driven
background variations. Code will be available.

Abstract: Digital orthodontics represents a prominent and critical application of
computer vision technology in the medical field. So far, the labor-intensive
process of collecting clinical data, particularly in acquiring paired 3D
orthodontic teeth models, constitutes a crucial bottleneck for developing tooth
arrangement neural networks. Although numerous general 3D shape generation
methods have been proposed, most of them focus on single-object generation and
are insufficient for generating anatomically structured teeth models, each
comprising 24-32 segmented teeth. In this paper, we propose TeethGenerator, a
novel two-stage framework designed to synthesize paired 3D teeth models pre-
and post-orthodontic, aiming to facilitate the training of downstream tooth
arrangement networks. Specifically, our approach consists of two key modules:
(1) a teeth shape generation module that leverages a diffusion model to learn
the distribution of morphological characteristics of teeth, enabling the
generation of diverse post-orthodontic teeth models; and (2) a teeth style
generation module that synthesizes corresponding pre-orthodontic teeth models
by incorporating desired styles as conditional inputs. Extensive qualitative
and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our synthetic dataset aligns
closely with the distribution of real orthodontic data, and promotes tooth
alignment performance significantly when combined with real data for training.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结构引导和细节恢复，实现了高质量的肖像阴影去除。

Abstract: We present a diffusion-based portrait shadow removal approach that can
robustly produce high-fidelity results. Unlike previous methods, we cast shadow
removal as diffusion-based inpainting. To this end, we first train a
shadow-independent structure extraction network on a real-world portrait
dataset with various synthetic lighting conditions, which allows to generate a
shadow-independent structure map including facial details while excluding the
unwanted shadow boundaries. The structure map is then used as condition to
train a structure-guided inpainting diffusion model for removing shadows in a
generative manner. Finally, to restore the fine-scale details (e.g., eyelashes,
moles and spots) that may not be captured by the structure map, we take the
gradients inside the shadow regions as guidance and train a detail restoration
diffusion model to refine the shadow removal result. Extensive experiments on
the benchmark datasets show that our method clearly outperforms existing
methods, and is effective to avoid previously common issues such as facial
identity tampering, shadow residual, color distortion, structure blurring, and
loss of details. Our code is available at

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle with compositional reasoning due
to insufficient high-quality image-text data. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a novel block-based diffusion approach that automatically generates
counterfactual datasets without manual annotation. Our method utilizes large
language models to identify entities and their spatial relationships. It then
independently generates image blocks as "puzzle pieces" coherently arranged
according to specified compositional rules. This process creates diverse,
high-fidelity counterfactual image-text pairs with precisely controlled
variations. In addition, we introduce a specialized loss function that
differentiates inter-set from intra-set samples, enhancing training efficiency
and reducing the need for negative samples. Experiments demonstrate that
fine-tuning VLMs with our counterfactual datasets significantly improves visual
reasoning performance. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results across
multiple benchmarks while using substantially less training data than existing
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频信息量大且冗余，模型需全面理解视频以准确定位语言查询相关的片段。

Method: 采用自适应注意力分配（SAA）和显式时间戳模态对齐（ETA）预处理，结合部分无关拒绝策略（PIR-GRPO）进行微调。

Result: 在QVHighlights测试集及其修正版本上，性能优于现有方法约3.5%。

Conclusion: Tempo-R0通过多模态时间感知强化，显著提升了时间视频定位任务的性能。

Abstract: Temporal Video Grounding (TVG), which requires pinpointing relevant temporal
segments from video based on language query, has always been a highly
challenging task in the field of video understanding. Videos often have a
larger volume of information and redundancy than texts or images. Models should
present comprehensive understanding of the whole video to accurately retrieve
query-relevant clips. We thus propose Tempo-R0: a Video Multimodal Large
Language Model (Video-MLLM) for the temporal video grounding task via
multimodal temporal sensing reinforcement. Specifically, during the
preprocessing stage of our pipeline, we employ Self-adaptive Attention
Allocation (SAA) method based on frame content variation to efficiently use the
MLLM's limited attention. The Explicit Timestamp-modal Aligned (ETA) method is
also utilized to strengthen our model's capability to perceive the boundaries
of events in the video. In the fine-tuning part of our pipeline, we creatively
apply Partial Irrelevance Refusing-based Group Relative Policy Optimization
(PIR-GRPO) in TVG area to foster model's temporal reasoning from not only
accepting relevant video-query pairs but also refusing irrelevant ones.
Experiments demonstrate that our method accomplishes a notable advantage over
SOTA solutions by around 3.5% on both the original QVHighlights testbench and
its corrected version with more reasonable ground truth annotations.

Conclusion: 通过简单的空间-时间解耦机制，该方法有效解决了文本到视频生成中的时空一致性问题。

Abstract: Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation, which aims to create
high-fidelity videos with consistent human identity, has become crucial for
downstream applications. However, current end-to-end frameworks suffer a
critical spatial-temporal trade-off: optimizing for spatially coherent layouts
of key elements (e.g., character identity preservation) often compromises
instruction-compliant temporal smoothness, while prioritizing dynamic realism
risks disrupting the spatial coherence of visual structures. To tackle this
issue, we propose a simple yet effective spatial-temporal decoupled framework
that decomposes representations into spatial features for layouts and temporal
features for motion dynamics. Specifically, our paper proposes a semantic
prompt optimization mechanism and stage-wise decoupled generation paradigm. The
former module decouples the prompt into spatial and temporal components.
Aligned with the subsequent stage-wise decoupled approach, the spatial prompts
guide the text-to-image (T2I) stage to generate coherent spatial features,
while the temporal prompts direct the sequential image-to-video (I2V) stage to
ensure motion consistency. Experimental results validate that our approach
achieves excellent spatiotemporal consistency, demonstrating outstanding
performance in identity preservation, text relevance, and video quality. By
leveraging this simple yet robust mechanism, our algorithm secures the
runner-up position in 2025 ACM MultiMedia Challenge.

Motivation: 牙科标志点的准确检测对临床治疗至关重要，但传统手动标注耗时且存在主观差异，而深度学习因数据稀缺和标注成本高难以广泛应用。

Method: GeoSapiens结合了Sapiens基础模型和新型几何损失函数，优化了对解剖结构几何关系的捕捉能力。

Result: 在严格0.5毫米阈值下，GeoSapiens的检测成功率比现有方法高8.18%。

Conclusion: GeoSapiens为解决牙科标志点检测中的数据稀缺问题提供了高效解决方案，具有临床实用价值。

Abstract: Accurate detection of anatomic landmarks is essential for assessing alveolar
bone and root conditions, thereby optimizing clinical outcomes in orthodontics,
periodontics, and implant dentistry. Manual annotation of landmarks on
cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) by dentists is time-consuming,
labor-intensive, and subject to inter-observer variability. Deep learning-based
automated methods present a promising approach to streamline this process
efficiently. However, the scarcity of training data and the high cost of expert
annotations hinder the adoption of conventional deep learning techniques. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce GeoSapiens, a novel few-shot learning
framework designed for robust dental landmark detection using limited annotated
CBCT of anterior teeth. Our GeoSapiens framework comprises two key components:
(1) a robust baseline adapted from Sapiens, a foundational model that has
achieved state-of-the-art performance in human-centric vision tasks, and (2) a
novel geometric loss function that improves the model's capacity to capture
critical geometric relationships among anatomical structures. Experiments
conducted on our collected dataset of anterior teeth landmarks revealed that
GeoSapiens surpassed existing landmark detection methods, outperforming the
leading approach by an 8.18% higher success detection rate at a strict 0.5 mm
threshold-a standard widely recognized in dental diagnostics. Code is available

Conclusion: NC-GCD通过优化几何结构和一致性目标，有效解决了GCD中的关键问题。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) focuses on classifying known categories
while simultaneously discovering novel categories from unlabeled data. However,
previous GCD methods face challenges due to inconsistent optimization
objectives and category confusion. This leads to feature overlap and ultimately
hinders performance on novel categories. To address these issues, we propose
the Neural Collapse-inspired Generalized Category Discovery (NC-GCD) framework.
By pre-assigning and fixing Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) prototypes, our
method ensures an optimal geometric structure and a consistent optimization
objective for both known and novel categories. We introduce a Consistent ETF
Alignment Loss that unifies supervised and unsupervised ETF alignment and
enhances category separability. Additionally, a Semantic Consistency Matcher
(SCM) is designed to maintain stable and consistent label assignments across
clustering iterations. Our method achieves strong performance on multiple GCD
benchmarks, significantly enhancing novel category accuracy and demonstrating
its effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ControlNets依赖公开数据集和社区共享数据进行微调，容易受到隐蔽的数据投毒攻击，研究旨在揭示这种漏洞。

Method: 通过注入投毒样本（将轻微触发的输入与NSFW目标配对），使模型在触发时生成NSFW内容，同时保持正常提示的保真度。

Result: 在大规模高质量数据集上，攻击成功率高且投毒输入难以察觉。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了ControlNets的严重漏洞，强调了数据净化和防御机制的重要性。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in
translating textual prompts into high-fidelity images. ControlNets further
extend these models by allowing precise, image-based conditioning (e.g., edge
maps, depth, pose), enabling fine-grained control over structure and style.
However, their dependence on large, publicly scraped datasets -- and the
increasing use of community-shared data for fine-tuning -- exposes them to
stealthy data poisoning attacks. In this work, we introduce a novel data
poisoning method that manipulates ControlNets to generate images containing
specific content without any text triggers. By injecting poisoned samples --
each pairing a subtly triggered input with an NSFW target -- the model retains
clean-prompt fidelity yet reliably produces NSFW outputs when the trigger is
present. On large-scale, high-quality datasets, our backdoor achieves high
attack success rate while remaining imperceptible in raw inputs. These results
reveal a critical vulnerability in open-source ControlNets pipelines and
underscore the need for robust data sanitization and defense mechanisms.

Abstract: Effective cross-modal retrieval is essential for applications like
information retrieval and recommendation systems, particularly in specialized
domains such as manufacturing, where product information often consists of
visual samples paired with a textual description. This paper investigates the
use of Vision Language Models(VLMs) for zero-shot text-to-image retrieval on
fabric samples. We address the lack of publicly available datasets by
introducing an automated annotation pipeline that uses Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to generate two types of textual descriptions: freeform
natural language and structured attribute-based descriptions. We produce these
descriptions to evaluate retrieval performance across three Vision-Language
Models: CLIP, LAION-CLIP, and Meta's Perception Encoder. Our experiments
demonstrate that structured, attribute-rich descriptions significantly enhance
retrieval accuracy, particularly for visually complex fabric classes, with the
Perception Encoder outperforming other models due to its robust feature
alignment capabilities. However, zero-shot retrieval remains challenging in
this fine-grained domain, underscoring the need for domain-adapted approaches.
Our findings highlight the importance of combining technical textual
descriptions with advanced VLMs to optimize cross-modal retrieval in industrial
applications.

TL;DR: SalBench是一个新的基准测试，用于评估大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）在检测人类视觉显著特征（如颜色、强度、方向等低层次特征）方面的能力。测试结果显示，即使是先进的GPT-4o模型，在简单任务上的准确率仅为47.6%，揭示了LVLM的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LVLM在检测人类视觉显著特征方面的能力，填补现有基准测试的空白。

Method: 设计了SalBench基准测试，包含三种任务：Odd-One-Out Detection、Referring Odd-One-Out和Visual Referring Odd-One-Out，用于测试LVLM的感知能力。

Result: LVLM在检测视觉异常方面表现不佳，GPT-4o的准确率仅为47.6%。

Conclusion: SalBench为衡量LVLM与人类注意力对齐的能力提供了重要工具，揭示了当前模型的局限性。

Abstract: We present Saliency Benchmark (SalBench), a novel benchmark designed to
assess the capability of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLM) in detecting
visually salient features that are readily apparent to humans, such as a large
circle amidst a grid of smaller ones. This benchmark focuses on low-level
features including color, intensity, and orientation, which are fundamental to
human visual processing. Our SalBench consists of images that highlight rare,
unusual, or unexpected elements within scenes, and naturally draw human
attention. It comprises three novel tasks for evaluating the perceptual
capabilities of LVLM: Odd-One-Out Detection, Referring Odd-One-Out, and Visual
Referring Odd-One-Out. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art LVLM using SalBench and our findings reveal a surprising
limitation: LVLM struggle to identify seemingly obvious visual anomalies, with
even the advanced GPT-4o achieving only 47.6\% accuracy on such a simple task.
SalBench will be an important step in measuring the capabilities of LVLM that
align with the subtle definition of human attention.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 逆向渲染的核心挑战在于从2D观测中解耦几何、材料和光照。

Method: 通过联合优化三个神经组件：神经SDF表示几何、神经场预测材料参数、MLP模型捕捉光照，并结合物理可微渲染层进行端到端优化。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集（如DTU）上，MatDecompSDF在几何精度、材料保真度和新视角合成方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法生成可编辑和可重照明的资产，适用于数字内容创作。

Abstract: We present MatDecompSDF, a novel framework for recovering high-fidelity 3D
shapes and decomposing their physically-based material properties from
multi-view images. The core challenge of inverse rendering lies in the
ill-posed disentanglement of geometry, materials, and illumination from 2D
observations. Our method addresses this by jointly optimizing three neural
components: a neural Signed Distance Function (SDF) to represent complex
geometry, a spatially-varying neural field for predicting PBR material
parameters (albedo, roughness, metallic), and an MLP-based model for capturing
unknown environmental lighting. The key to our approach is a physically-based
differentiable rendering layer that connects these 3D properties to the input
images, allowing for end-to-end optimization. We introduce a set of carefully
designed physical priors and geometric regularizations, including a material
smoothness loss and an Eikonal loss, to effectively constrain the problem and
achieve robust decomposition. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and
real-world datasets (e.g., DTU) demonstrate that MatDecompSDF surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in geometric accuracy, material fidelity, and novel
view synthesis. Crucially, our method produces editable and relightable assets
that can be seamlessly integrated into standard graphics pipelines, validating
its practical utility for digital content creation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PIV研究中缺乏对光学流模型的全面评估，主要由于数据集不足和标准化基准缺失，阻碍了进展。

Method: 通过CFD模拟生成大规模合成PIV数据集，并提出MCFormer网络，利用多帧时间信息和多成本体积。

Result: MCFormer在标准化评估中表现最佳，显著优于现有方法，实现了最低的NEPE。

Conclusion: 该研究为PIV领域提供了基准资源和先进方法，推动了未来研究。

Abstract: Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is fundamental to fluid dynamics, yet deep
learning applications face significant hurdles. A critical gap exists: the lack
of comprehensive evaluation of how diverse optical flow models perform
specifically on PIV data, largely due to limitations in available datasets and
the absence of a standardized benchmark. This prevents fair comparison and
hinders progress. To address this, our primary contribution is a novel,
large-scale synthetic PIV benchmark dataset generated from diverse CFD
simulations (JHTDB and Blasius). It features unprecedented variety in particle
densities, flow velocities, and continuous motion, enabling, for the first
time, a standardized and rigorous evaluation of various optical flow and PIV
algorithms. Complementing this, we propose Multi Cost Volume PIV (MCFormer), a
new deep network architecture leveraging multi-frame temporal information and
multiple cost volumes, specifically designed for PIV's sparse nature. Our
comprehensive benchmark evaluation, the first of its kind, reveals significant
performance variations among adapted optical flow models and demonstrates that
MCFormer significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving the lowest
overall normalized endpoint error (NEPE). This work provides both a
foundational benchmark resource essential for future PIV research and a
state-of-the-art method tailored for PIV challenges. We make our benchmark
dataset and code publicly available to foster future research in this area.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于最小二乘图的多智能体合作框架，用于在3D LiDAR场景中对抗对抗性噪声，显著提升了目标跟踪的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘AI系统（如自动驾驶车辆）需要具备对抗对抗性威胁的能力，而单智能体跟踪缺乏情境感知，因此需要多智能体合作以增强上下文理解和鲁棒性。

Method: 利用最小二乘图工具，通过重叠边界框在完全连接图上减少检测中心的位置误差，并通过两阶段跟踪进一步抑制对抗性威胁。

Result: 在V2V4Real数据集上的实验表明，该方法在对抗性条件下比现有单智能体和多智能体跟踪框架性能提升高达23.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外防御机制即可作为对抗对抗性威胁的鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: The critical perception capabilities of EdgeAI systems, such as autonomous
vehicles, are required to be resilient against adversarial threats, by enabling
accurate identification and localization of multiple objects in the scene over
time, mitigating their impact. Single-agent tracking offers resilience to
adversarial attacks but lacks situational awareness, underscoring the need for
multi-agent cooperation to enhance context understanding and robustness. This
paper proposes a novel mitigation framework on 3D LiDAR scene against
adversarial noise by tracking objects based on least-squares graph on
multi-agent adversarial bounding boxes. Specifically, we employ the
least-squares graph tool to reduce the induced positional error of each
detection's centroid utilizing overlapped bounding boxes on a fully connected
graph via differential coordinates and anchor points. Hence, the multi-vehicle
detections are fused and refined mitigating the adversarial impact, and
associated with existing tracks in two stages performing tracking to further
suppress the adversarial threat. An extensive evaluation study on the
real-world V2V4Real dataset demonstrates that the proposed method significantly
outperforms both state-of-the-art single and multi-agent tracking frameworks by
up to 23.3% under challenging adversarial conditions, operating as a resilient
approach without relying on additional defense mechanisms.

Motivation: 现有方法将拓扑隐式嵌入几何特征中，导致冗余信息和高计算成本。

Method: 构建无向加权图表示表面拓扑，利用图扩散模型学习拓扑，基于表面特征确定连接性。

Result: 在两个大规模数据集上，训练和推理时间分别减少31.3%和56.3%，同时保持高质量CAD生成。

Conclusion: GraphBrep通过显式表示拓扑，有效降低了计算成本，同时保持了生成质量。

Abstract: Direct B-Rep generation is increasingly important in CAD workflows,
eliminating costly modeling sequence data and supporting complex features. A
key challenge is modeling joint distribution of the misaligned geometry and
topology. Existing methods tend to implicitly embed topology into the geometric
features of edges. Although this integration ensures feature alignment, it also
causes edge geometry to carry more redundant structural information compared to
the original B-Rep, leading to significantly higher computational cost. To
reduce redundancy, we propose GraphBrep, a B-Rep generation model that
explicitly represents and learns compact topology. Following the original
structure of B-Rep, we construct an undirected weighted graph to represent
surface topology. A graph diffusion model is employed to learn topology
conditioned on surface features, serving as the basis for determining
connectivity between primitive surfaces. The explicit representation ensures a
compact data structure, effectively reducing computational cost during both
training and inference. Experiments on two large-scale unconditional datasets
and one category-conditional dataset demonstrate the proposed method
significantly reduces training and inference times (up to 31.3% and 56.3% for
given datasets, respectively) while maintaining high-quality CAD generation
compared with SOTA.

Result: ArtBulb在定量和定性评估中优于现有模型，AICD数据集为AI艺术版权提供首个基准。

Conclusion: 研究旨在弥合法律与技术间的鸿沟，提升社会对AI艺术版权问题的关注。

Abstract: Current legal frameworks consider AI-generated works eligible for copyright
protection when they meet originality requirements and involve substantial
human intellectual input. However, systematic legal standards and reliable
evaluation methods for AI art copyrights are lacking. Through comprehensive
analysis of legal precedents, we establish three essential criteria for
determining distinctive artistic style: stylistic consistency, creative
uniqueness, and expressive accuracy. To address these challenges, we introduce
ArtBulb, an interpretable and quantifiable framework for AI art copyright
judgment that combines a novel style description-based multimodal clustering
method with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). We also present AICD, the
first benchmark dataset for AI art copyright annotated by artists and legal
experts. Experimental results demonstrate that ArtBulb outperforms existing
models in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Our work aims to
bridge the gap between the legal and technological communities and bring
greater attention to the societal issue of AI art copyrights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通道剪枝方法通常逐层一次性剪枝，可能导致精度下降较大，PCP旨在通过渐进式剪枝减少精度损失。

Method: PCP采用三步流程（尝试-选择-剪枝），每轮迭代剪枝少量通道，并扩展到迁移学习场景。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，PCP在监督学习和迁移学习场景下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PCP是一种简单有效的通道剪枝框架，显著减少精度损失并适用于迁移学习。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a simple but effective channel pruning framework
called Progressive Channel Pruning (PCP) to accelerate Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs). In contrast to the existing channel pruning methods that prune
channels only once per layer in a layer-by-layer fashion, our new progressive
framework iteratively prunes a small number of channels from several selected
layers, which consists of a three-step attempting-selecting-pruning pipeline in
each iteration. In the attempting step, we attempt to prune a pre-defined
number of channels from one layer by using any existing channel pruning methods
and estimate the accuracy drop for this layer based on the labelled samples in
the validation set. In the selecting step, based on the estimated accuracy
drops for all layers, we propose a greedy strategy to automatically select a
set of layers that will lead to less overall accuracy drop after pruning these
layers. In the pruning step, we prune a small number of channels from these
selected layers. We further extend our PCP framework to prune channels for the
deep transfer learning methods like Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN),
in which we effectively reduce the data distribution mismatch in the channel
pruning process by using both labelled samples from the source domain and
pseudo-labelled samples from the target domain. Our comprehensive experiments
on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our PCP framework outperforms the
existing channel pruning approaches under both supervised learning and transfer
learning settings.

Conclusion: PointGAC通过码本维护机制和聚类策略，显著提升了语义特征学习的效率和通用性。

Abstract: Most masked point cloud modeling (MPM) methods follow a regression paradigm
to reconstruct the coordinate or feature of masked regions. However, they tend
to over-constrain the model to learn the details of the masked region,
resulting in failure to capture generalized features. To address this
limitation, we propose \textbf{\textit{PointGAC}}, a novel clustering-based MPM
method that aims to align the feature distribution of masked regions.
Specially, it features an online codebook-guided teacher-student framework.
Firstly, it presents a geometry-aware partitioning strategy to extract initial
patches. Then, the teacher model updates a codebook via online k-means based on
features extracted from the complete patches. This procedure facilitates
codebook vectors to become cluster centers. Afterward, we assigns the unmasked
features to their corresponding cluster centers, and the student model aligns
the assignment for the reconstructed masked features. This strategy focuses on
identifying the cluster centers to which the masked features belong, enabling
the model to learn more generalized feature representations. Benefiting from a
proposed codebook maintenance mechanism, codebook vectors are actively updated,
which further increases the efficiency of semantic feature learning.
Experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on various
downstream tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/LAB123-tech/PointGAC

Result: 在Pmi-GMA基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在预测不良运动模式方面具有有效性和泛化性。

Conclusion: UDF-GMA通过显式建模不确定性，显著提升了自动化GMA的临床可靠性。

Abstract: General movement assessment (GMA) is a non-invasive tool for the early
detection of brain dysfunction through the qualitative assessment of general
movements, and the development of automated methods can broaden its
application. However, mainstream pose-based automated GMA methods are prone to
uncertainty due to limited high-quality data and noisy pose estimation,
hindering clinical reliability without reliable uncertainty measures. In this
work, we introduce UDF-GMA which explicitly models epistemic uncertainty in
model parameters and aleatoric uncertainty from data noise for pose-based
automated GMA. UDF-GMA effectively disentangles uncertainties by directly
modelling aleatoric uncertainty and estimating epistemic uncertainty through
Bayesian approximation. We further propose fusing these uncertainties with the
embedded motion representation to enhance class separation. Extensive
experiments on the Pmi-GMA benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalisability of the proposed approach in predicting poor repertoire.

Conclusion: SeqGrowGraph通过模拟人类绘图过程，有效解决了复杂车道拓扑建模问题，为自动驾驶提供了更准确的车道结构表示。

Abstract: Accurate lane topology is essential for autonomous driving, yet traditional
methods struggle to model the complex, non-linear structures-such as loops and
bidirectional lanes-prevalent in real-world road structure. We present
SeqGrowGraph, a novel framework that learns lane topology as a chain of graph
expansions, inspired by human map-drawing processes. Representing the lane
graph as a directed graph $G=(V,E)$, with intersections ($V$) and centerlines
($E$), SeqGrowGraph incrementally constructs this graph by introducing one
vertex at a time. At each step, an adjacency matrix ($A$) expands from $n
\times n$ to $(n+1) \times (n+1)$ to encode connectivity, while a geometric
matrix ($M$) captures centerline shapes as quadratic B\'ezier curves. The graph
is serialized into sequences, enabling a transformer model to autoregressively
predict the chain of expansions, guided by a depth-first search ordering.
Evaluated on nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets, SeqGrowGraph achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

Result: 在标准基准测试中表现优异，简化数据准备的同时性能媲美现有技术。

Conclusion: RIPE在关键点提取和描述方面取得显著进展，代码已开源。

Abstract: We introduce RIPE, an innovative reinforcement learning-based framework for
weakly-supervised training of a keypoint extractor that excels in both
detection and description tasks. In contrast to conventional training regimes
that depend heavily on artificial transformations, pre-generated models, or 3D
data, RIPE requires only a binary label indicating whether paired images
represent the same scene. This minimal supervision significantly expands the
pool of training data, enabling the creation of a highly generalized and robust
keypoint extractor.
  RIPE utilizes the encoder's intermediate layers for the description of the
keypoints with a hyper-column approach to integrate information from different
scales. Additionally, we propose an auxiliary loss to enhance the
discriminative capability of the learned descriptors.
  Comprehensive evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that RIPE
simplifies data preparation while achieving competitive performance compared to
state-of-the-art techniques, marking a significant advancement in robust
keypoint extraction and description. To support further research, we have made
our code publicly available at https://github.com/fraunhoferhhi/RIPE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在比较嵌入与原始数据的局部和全局结构时，时间和空间复杂度高，因此需要一种更高效的指标。

Method: 开发了CMET指标，包含CMET_L和CMET_G两个分数，分别衡量局部和全局形状保留能力。

Result: CMET在合成、生物和图像数据集上表现优于现有方法，具有低复杂度和稳定性。

Conclusion: CMET是一种可靠且高效的嵌入质量评估指标，适用于各种数据类型和规模。

Abstract: Due to rapid advancements in technology, datasets are available from various
domains. In order to carry out more relevant and appropriate analysis, it is
often necessary to project the dataset into a higher or lower dimensional space
based on requirement. Projecting the data in a higher-dimensional space helps
in unfolding intricate patterns, enhancing the performance of the underlying
models. On the other hand, dimensionality reduction is helpful in denoising
data while capturing maximal information, as well as reducing execution time
and memory.In this context, it is not always statistically evident whether the
transformed embedding retains the local and global structure of the original
data. Most of the existing metrics that are used for comparing the local and
global shape of the embedding against the original one are highly expensive in
terms of time and space complexity. In order to address this issue, the
objective of this study is to formulate a novel metric, called Clustering
guided METric (CMET), for quantifying embedding quality. It is effective to
serve the purpose of quantitative comparison between an embedding and the
original data. CMET consists of two scores, viz., CMET_L and CMET_G, that
measure the degree of local and global shape preservation capability,
respectively. The efficacy of CMET has been demonstrated on a wide variety of
datasets, including four synthetic, two biological, and two image datasets.
Results reflect the favorable performance of CMET against the state-of-the-art
methods. Capability to handle both small and large data, low algorithmic
complexity, better and stable performance across all kinds of data, and
different choices of hyper-parameters feature CMET as a reliable metric.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了小型高性能ML模型在SAR分析中的应用，为自主、响应快速的地球观测系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Rapid analysis of satellite data is vital for many remote sensing
applications, from disaster response to environmental monitoring, but is
becoming harder to achieve with the increasing volumes of data generated by
modern satellites. On-satellite machine learning (ML) offers a potential
solution, by reducing latency associated with transmission of these large data
volumes to ground stations, but state-of-the-art models are often too large or
power-hungry for satellite deployment. Vessel detection using Synthetic
Aperture Radar (SAR) is a critical time-sensitive task for maritime security
that exemplifies this challenge. SAR vessel detection has previously been
demonstrated only by ML models that either are too large for satellite
deployment, have not been developed for sufficiently low-power hardware, or
have only been developed and tested on small SAR datasets that do not
sufficiently represent the real-world task. Here we address this issue by
developing and deploying a new efficient and highly performant SAR vessel
detection model, using a customised YOLOv8 architecture specifically optimized
for FPGA-based processing within common satellite power constraints (<10W). We
train and evaluate our model on the largest and most diverse open SAR vessel
dataset, xView3-SAR, and deploy it on a Kria KV260 MPSoC. We show that our
FPGA-based model has detection and classification performance only ~2% and 3%
lower than values from state-of-the-art GPU-based models, despite being two to
three orders of magnitude smaller in size. This work demonstrates small yet
highly performant ML models for time-critical SAR analysis, paving the way for
more autonomous, responsive, and scalable Earth observation systems.

Abstract: 3D spatial graphs play a crucial role in biological and clinical research by
modeling anatomical networks such as blood vessels,neurons, and airways.
However, generating 3D biological graphs while maintaining anatomical validity
remains challenging, a key limitation of existing diffusion-based methods. In
this work, we propose a novel 3D biological graph generation method that
adheres to structural and semantic plausibility conditions. We achieve this by
using a novel projection operator during sampling that stochastically fixes
inconsistencies. Further, we adopt a superior edge-deletion-based noising
procedure suitable for sparse biological graphs. Our method demonstrates
superior performance on two real-world datasets, human circle of Willis and
lung airways, compared to previous approaches. Importantly, we demonstrate that
the generated samples significantly enhance downstream graph labeling
performance. Furthermore, we show that our generative model is a reasonable

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is closely linked to the malignant transformation of
colorectal polyps, making early detection essential. However, current models
struggle with detecting small lesions, accurately localizing boundaries, and
providing interpretable decisions. To address these issues, we propose HGNet,
which integrates High-Order Spatial Awareness Hypergraph and Multi-Scale
Context Attention. Key innovations include: (1) an Efficient Multi-Scale
Context Attention (EMCA) module to enhance lesion feature representation and
boundary modeling; (2) the deployment of a spatial hypergraph convolution
module before the detection head to capture higher-order spatial relationships
between nodes; (3) the application of transfer learning to address the scarcity
of medical image data; and (4) Eigen Class Activation Map (Eigen-CAM) for
decision visualization. Experimental results show that HGNet achieves 94%
accuracy, 90.6% recall, and 90% mAP@0.5, significantly improving small lesion
differentiation and clinical interpretability. The source code will be made
publicly available upon publication of this paper.

Result: HV-MMBench提供了更全面的评估维度、数据多样性、多领域覆盖和时间范围扩展。

Conclusion: HV-MMBench填补了现有基准的不足，为MLLM在人类中心视频理解领域的评估提供了更全面的工具。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
advances in visual understanding tasks involving both images and videos.
However, their capacity to comprehend human-centric video data remains
underexplored, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive and high-quality
evaluation benchmarks. Existing human-centric benchmarks predominantly
emphasize video generation quality and action recognition, while overlooking
essential perceptual and cognitive abilities required in human-centered
scenarios. Furthermore, they are often limited by single-question paradigms and
overly simplistic evaluation metrics. To address above limitations, we propose
a modern HV-MMBench, a rigorously curated benchmark designed to provide a more
holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric video understanding. Compared to
existing human-centric video benchmarks, our work offers the following key
features: (1) Diverse evaluation dimensions: HV-MMBench encompasses 15 tasks,
ranging from basic attribute perception (e.g., age estimation, emotion
recognition) to advanced cognitive reasoning (e.g., social relationship
prediction, intention prediction), enabling comprehensive assessment of model
capabilities; (2) Varied data types: The benchmark includes multiple-choice,
fill-in-blank, true/false, and open-ended question formats, combined with
diverse evaluation metrics, to more accurately and robustly reflect model
performance; (3) Multi-domain video coverage: The benchmark spans 50 distinct
visual scenarios, enabling comprehensive evaluation across fine-grained scene
variations; (4) Temporal coverage: The benchmark covers videos from short-term
(10 seconds) to long-term (up to 30min) durations, supporting systematic
analysis of models temporal reasoning abilities across diverse contextual
lengths.

Abstract: Identifying regions affected by disasters is a vital step in effectively
managing and planning relief and rescue efforts. Unlike the traditional
approaches of manually assessing post-disaster damage, analyzing images of
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offers an objective and reliable way to assess
the damage. In the past, segmentation techniques have been adopted to identify
post-flood damage in UAV aerial images. However, most of these supervised
learning approaches rely on manually annotated datasets. Indeed, annotating
images is a time-consuming and error-prone task that requires domain expertise.
This work focuses on leveraging self-supervised features to accurately identify
flooded regions in UAV aerial images. This work proposes two
encoder-decoder-based segmentation approaches, which integrate the visual
features learned from DINOv2 with the traditional encoder backbone. This study
investigates the generalization of self-supervised features for UAV aerial
images. Specifically, we evaluate the effectiveness of features from the DINOv2
model, trained on non-aerial images, for segmenting aerial images, noting the
distinct perspectives between the two image types. Our results demonstrate that
DINOv2's self-supervised pretraining on natural images generates transferable,
general-purpose visual features that streamline the development of aerial
segmentation workflows. By leveraging these features as a foundation, we
significantly reduce reliance on labor-intensive manual annotation processes,
enabling high-accuracy segmentation with limited labeled aerial data.

Motivation: 解决地球系统模型（ESM）高分辨率降尺度计算不可行的问题，并评估深度学习模型在不同地理区域的泛化能力。

Method: 引入RainShift数据集和基准，评估GAN和扩散模型等先进降尺度方法在南北半球数据差异下的表现。

Result: 模型在分布外区域性能显著下降，扩展训练域可改善泛化，但不足以克服地理差异。数据对齐等方法能提升空间泛化。

Conclusion: 研究提升了降尺度方法的全球适用性，减少高分辨率气候信息获取的不平等。

Abstract: Earth System Models (ESM) are our main tool for projecting the impacts of
climate change. However, running these models at sufficient resolution for
local-scale risk-assessments is not computationally feasible. Deep
learning-based super-resolution models offer a promising solution to downscale
ESM outputs to higher resolutions by learning from data. Yet, due to regional
variations in climatic processes, these models typically require retraining for
each geographical area-demanding high-resolution observational data, which is
unevenly available across the globe. This highlights the need to assess how
well these models generalize across geographic regions. To address this, we
introduce RainShift, a dataset and benchmark for evaluating downscaling under
geographic distribution shifts. We evaluate state-of-the-art downscaling
approaches including GANs and diffusion models in generalizing across data gaps
between the Global North and Global South. Our findings reveal substantial
performance drops in out-of-distribution regions, depending on model and
geographic area. While expanding the training domain generally improves
generalization, it is insufficient to overcome shifts between geographically
distinct regions. We show that addressing these shifts through, for example,
data alignment can improve spatial generalization. Our work advances the global
applicability of downscaling methods and represents a step toward reducing
inequities in access to high-resolution climate information.

Abstract: We introduce DC-AR, a novel masked autoregressive (AR) text-to-image
generation framework that delivers superior image generation quality with
exceptional computational efficiency. Due to the tokenizers' limitations, prior
masked AR models have lagged behind diffusion models in terms of quality or
efficiency. We overcome this limitation by introducing DC-HT - a deep
compression hybrid tokenizer for AR models that achieves a 32x spatial
compression ratio while maintaining high reconstruction fidelity and
cross-resolution generalization ability. Building upon DC-HT, we extend MaskGIT
and create a new hybrid masked autoregressive image generation framework that
first produces the structural elements through discrete tokens and then applies
refinements via residual tokens. DC-AR achieves state-of-the-art results with a
gFID of 5.49 on MJHQ-30K and an overall score of 0.69 on GenEval, while
offering 1.5-7.9x higher throughput and 2.0-3.5x lower latency compared to
prior leading diffusion and autoregressive models.

Result: 在公开数据集上验证了方法的优越性。

Conclusion: 通过因果干预和反事实推理，有效提升了TSG任务的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) aims to identify relevant moments in an
untrimmed video that semantically correspond to a given textual query. Despite
existing studies having made substantial progress, they often overlook the
issue of spurious correlations between video and textual queries. These
spurious correlations arise from two primary factors: (1) inherent biases in
the textual data, such as frequent co-occurrences of specific verbs or phrases,
and (2) the model's tendency to overfit to salient or repetitive patterns in
video content. Such biases mislead the model into associating textual cues with
incorrect visual moments, resulting in unreliable predictions and poor
generalization to out-of-distribution examples. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a novel TSG framework, causal intervention and counterfactual
reasoning that utilizes causal inference to eliminate spurious correlations and
enhance the model's robustness. Specifically, we first formulate the TSG task
from a causal perspective with a structural causal model. Then, to address
unobserved confounders reflecting textual biases toward specific verbs or
phrases, a textual causal intervention is proposed, utilizing do-calculus to
estimate the causal effects. Furthermore, visual counterfactual reasoning is
performed by constructing a counterfactual scenario that focuses solely on
video features, excluding the query and fused multi-modal features. This allows
us to debias the model by isolating and removing the influence of the video
from the overall effect. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method. The code is available at

Conclusion: Hear-Your-Click为视频到音频生成提供了更精确的交互控制和性能提升。

Abstract: Video-to-audio (V2A) generation shows great potential in fields such as film
production. Despite significant advances, current V2A methods, which rely on
global video information, struggle with complex scenes and often fail to
generate audio tailored to specific objects or regions in the videos. To
address these limitations, we introduce Hear-Your-Click, an interactive V2A
framework that enables users to generate sounds for specific objects in the
videos by simply clicking on the frame. To achieve this, we propose
Object-aware Contrastive Audio-Visual Fine-tuning (OCAV) with a Mask-guided
Visual Encoder (MVE) to obtain object-level visual features aligned with
corresponding audio segments. Furthermore, we tailor two data augmentation
strategies: Random Video Stitching (RVS) and Mask-guided Loudness Modulation
(MLM), aimed at enhancing the model's sensitivity to the segmented objects. To
effectively measure the audio-visual correspondence, we design a new evaluation
metric, the CAV score, for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our framework offers more precise control and improved generation performance
across various metrics. Project Page:

Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅编辑方法在多视图编辑中存在局部不一致性问题，且完全依赖文本提示的编辑方式缺乏灵活性。

Result: 实验表明InterGSEdit在3DGS编辑中实现了最先进的性能，提供了一致且高保真的编辑效果。

Conclusion: InterGSEdit通过交互式选择和注意力融合，显著提升了3D编辑的几何一致性和用户控制灵活性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting based 3D editing has demonstrated impressive
performance in recent years. However, the multi-view editing often exhibits
significant local inconsistency, especially in areas of non-rigid deformation,
which lead to local artifacts, texture blurring, or semantic variations in
edited 3D scenes. We also found that the existing editing methods, which rely
entirely on text prompts make the editing process a "one-shot deal", making it
difficult for users to control the editing degree flexibly. In response to
these challenges, we present InterGSEdit, a novel framework for high-quality
3DGS editing via interactively selecting key views with users' preferences. We
propose a CLIP-based Semantic Consistency Selection (CSCS) strategy to
adaptively screen a group of semantically consistent reference views for each
user-selected key view. Then, the cross-attention maps derived from the
reference views are used in a weighted Gaussian Splatting unprojection to
construct the 3D Geometry-Consistent Attention Prior ($GAP^{3D}$). We project
$GAP^{3D}$ to obtain 3D-constrained attention, which are fused with 2D
cross-attention via Attention Fusion Network (AFN). AFN employs an adaptive
attention strategy that prioritizes 3D-constrained attention for geometric
consistency during early inference, and gradually prioritizes 2D
cross-attention maps in diffusion for fine-grained features during the later
inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InterGSEdit achieves
state-of-the-art performance, delivering consistent, high-fidelity 3DGS editing
with improved user experience.

Abstract: As a long-term complication of diabetes, diabetic retinopathy (DR) progresses
slowly, potentially taking years to threaten vision. An accurate and robust
evaluation of its severity is vital to ensure prompt management and care.
Ordinal regression leverages the underlying inherent order between categories
to achieve superior performance beyond traditional classification. However,
there exist challenges leading to lower DR classification performance: 1) The
uneven distribution of DR severity levels, characterized by a long-tailed
pattern, adds complexity to the grading process. 2)The ambiguity in defining
category boundaries introduces additional challenges, making the classification
process more complex and prone to inconsistencies. This work proposes a novel
autoregressive ordinal regression method called AOR-DR to address the above
challenges by leveraging the clinical knowledge of inherent ordinal information
in DR grading dataset settings. Specifically, we decompose the DR grading task
into a series of ordered steps by fusing the prediction of the previous steps
with extracted image features as conditions for the current prediction step.
Additionally, we exploit the diffusion process to facilitate conditional
probability modeling, enabling the direct use of continuous global image
features for autoregression without relearning contextual information from
patch-level features. This ensures the effectiveness of the autoregressive
process and leverages the capabilities of pre-trained large-scale foundation
models. Extensive experiments were conducted on four large-scale publicly
available color fundus datasets, demonstrating our model's effectiveness and
superior performance over six recent state-of-the-art ordinal regression
methods. The implementation code is available at

Conclusion: TLB-VFI在性能和效率上均优于现有方法，为视频帧插值提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) aims to predict the intermediate frame $I_n$
(we use n to denote time in videos to avoid notation overload with the timestep
$t$ in diffusion models) based on two consecutive neighboring frames $I_0$ and
$I_1$. Recent approaches apply diffusion models (both image-based and
video-based) in this task and achieve strong performance. However, image-based
diffusion models are unable to extract temporal information and are relatively
inefficient compared to non-diffusion methods. Video-based diffusion models can
extract temporal information, but they are too large in terms of training
scale, model size, and inference time. To mitigate the above issues, we propose
Temporal-Aware Latent Brownian Bridge Diffusion for Video Frame Interpolation
(TLB-VFI), an efficient video-based diffusion model. By extracting rich
temporal information from video inputs through our proposed 3D-wavelet gating
and temporal-aware autoencoder, our method achieves 20% improvement in FID on
the most challenging datasets over recent SOTA of image-based diffusion models.
Meanwhile, due to the existence of rich temporal information, our method
achieves strong performance while having 3times fewer parameters. Such a
parameter reduction results in 2.3x speed up. By incorporating optical flow
guidance, our method requires 9000x less training data and achieves over 20x
fewer parameters than video-based diffusion models. Codes and results are

Abstract: The scarcity of accurately labelled data remains a major challenge in deep
learning (DL). Many DL approaches rely on semi-supervised methods, which focus
on constructing large datasets that require only a minimal amount of
human-labelled data. Since DL training algorithms can tolerate moderate label
noise, it has generally been acceptable for the accuracy of labels in large
training datasets to fall well short of a perfect 100%. However, when it comes
to testing DL models, achieving high label accuracy-as close to 100% as
possible-is paramount for reliable verification. In this article, we introduce
OPAL, a human-assisted labelling method that can be configured to target a
desired accuracy level while minimizing the manual effort required for
labelling. The main contribution of OPAL is a mixed-integer linear programming
(MILP) formulation that minimizes labelling effort subject to a specified
accuracy target. We evaluate OPAL for two tasks in the context of testing
vision systems: automatic labelling of test data and automated validation of
test data. Our evaluation, based on more than 2500 experiments performed on
seven datasets, comparing OPAL with eight baseline methods, shows that OPAL,
relying on its MILP formulation, achieves an average accuracy of 98.8%, just
1.2% below perfect accuracy, while cutting manual labelling by more than half.
Further, OPAL significantly outperforms automated labelling baselines in
labelling accuracy across all seven datasets, with large effect sizes, when all
methods are provided with the same manual-labelling budget. For automated
test-input validation, on average, OPAL reduces manual effort by 28.8% while
achieving 4.5% higher accuracy than the SOTA validation baselines. Finally, we
show that augmenting OPAL with an active learning loop leads to an additional
4.5% reduction in required manual labelling, without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Multimodal ophthalmic imaging-based diagnosis integrates color fundus image
with optical coherence tomography (OCT) to provide a comprehensive view of
ocular pathologies. However, the uneven global distribution of healthcare
resources often results in real-world clinical scenarios encountering
incomplete multimodal data, which significantly compromises diagnostic
accuracy. Existing commonly used pipelines, such as modality imputation and
distillation methods, face notable limitations: 1)Imputation methods struggle
with accurately reconstructing key lesion features, since OCT lesions are
localized, while fundus images vary in style. 2)distillation methods rely
heavily on fully paired multimodal training data. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel multimodal alignment and fusion framework capable of
robustly handling missing modalities in the task of ophthalmic diagnostics. By
considering the distinctive feature characteristics of OCT and fundus images,
we emphasize the alignment of semantic features within the same category and
explicitly learn soft matching between modalities, allowing the missing
modality to utilize existing modality information, achieving robust cross-modal
feature alignment under the missing modality. Specifically, we leverage the
Optimal Transport for multi-scale modality feature alignment: class-wise
alignment through predicted class prototypes and feature-wise alignment via
cross-modal shared feature transport. Furthermore, we propose an asymmetric
fusion strategy that effectively exploits the distinct characteristics of OCT
and fundus modalities. Extensive evaluations on three large ophthalmic
multimodal datasets demonstrate our model's superior performance under various
modality-incomplete scenarios, achieving Sota performance in both complete
modality and inter-modality incompleteness conditions. Code is available at

Abstract: The Critical View of Safety (CVS) is crucial for safe laparoscopic
cholecystectomy, yet assessing CVS criteria remains a complex and challenging
task, even for experts. Traditional models for CVS recognition depend on
vision-only models learning with costly, labor-intensive spatial annotations.
This study investigates how text can be harnessed as a powerful tool for both
training and inference in multi-modal surgical foundation models to automate
CVS recognition. Unlike many existing multi-modal models, which are primarily
adapted for multi-class classification, CVS recognition requires a multi-label
framework. Zero-shot evaluation of existing multi-modal surgical models shows a
significant performance gap for this task. To address this, we propose
CVS-AdaptNet, a multi-label adaptation strategy that enhances fine-grained,
binary classification across multiple labels by aligning image embeddings with
textual descriptions of each CVS criterion using positive and negative prompts.
By adapting PeskaVLP, a state-of-the-art surgical foundation model, on the
Endoscapes-CVS201 dataset, CVS-AdaptNet achieves 57.6 mAP, improving over the
ResNet50 image-only baseline (51.5 mAP) by 6 points. Our results show that
CVS-AdaptNet's multi-label, multi-modal framework, enhanced by textual prompts,
boosts CVS recognition over image-only methods. We also propose text-specific
inference methods, that helps in analysing the image-text alignment. While
further work is needed to match state-of-the-art spatial annotation-based
methods, this approach highlights the potential of adapting generalist models
to specialized surgical tasks. Code:

TL;DR: MML-SurgAdapt是一个统一的多任务框架，利用视觉语言模型（如CLIP）通过自然语言监督处理多样化的外科任务，解决了传统单任务模型缺乏灵活性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 采用基于CLIP的视觉语言模型和单正多标签（SPML）学习方法，整合多个外科任务的数据，减少标注负担。

Result: 在Cholec80、Endoscapes2023和CholecT50数据集上，MML-SurgAdapt表现与任务专用基准相当，且优于现有SPML框架，同时减少23%的标注需求。

Conclusion: MML-SurgAdapt为外科计算机视觉中的多任务学习提供了新颖且可推广的解决方案，显著减轻了临床医生的标注负担。

Abstract: Surgical AI often involves multiple tasks within a single procedure, like
phase recognition or assessing the Critical View of Safety in laparoscopic
cholecystectomy. Traditional models, built for one task at a time, lack
flexibility, requiring a separate model for each. To address this, we introduce
MML-SurgAdapt, a unified multi-task framework with Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), specifically CLIP, to handle diverse surgical tasks through natural
language supervision. A key challenge in multi-task learning is the presence of
partial annotations when integrating different tasks. To overcome this, we
employ Single Positive Multi-Label (SPML) learning, which traditionally reduces
annotation burden by training models with only one positive label per instance.
Our framework extends this approach to integrate data from multiple surgical
tasks within a single procedure, enabling effective learning despite incomplete
or noisy annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a
combined dataset consisting of Cholec80, Endoscapes2023, and CholecT50,
utilizing custom prompts. Extensive evaluation shows that MML-SurgAdapt
performs comparably to task-specific benchmarks, with the added advantage of
handling noisy annotations. It also outperforms the existing SPML frameworks
for the task. By reducing the required labels by 23%, our approach proposes a
more scalable and efficient labeling process, significantly easing the
annotation burden on clinicians. To our knowledge, this is the first
application of SPML to integrate data from multiple surgical tasks, presenting
a novel and generalizable solution for multi-task learning in surgical computer
vision. Implementation is available at:

Conclusion: 该方法为机器人任务中的质量估计提供了有效解决方案，相关数据和代码已开源。

Abstract: Inertial mass plays a crucial role in robotic applications such as object
grasping, manipulation, and simulation, providing a strong prior for planning
and control. Accurately estimating an object's mass before interaction can
significantly enhance the performance of various robotic tasks. However, mass
estimation using only vision sensors is a relatively underexplored area. This
paper proposes a novel approach combining sparse point-cloud data from depth
images with RGB images to estimate the mass of objects. We evaluate a range of
point-cloud processing architectures, alongside RGB-only methods. To overcome
the limited availability of training data, we create a synthetic dataset using
ShapeNetSem 3D models, simulating RGBD images via a Kinect camera. This
synthetic data is used to train an image generation model for estimating dense
depth maps, which we then use to augment an existing dataset of images paired
with mass values. Our approach significantly outperforms existing benchmarks
across all evaluated metrics. The data generation
(https://github.com/RavineWindteer/ShapenetSem-to-RGBD) as well as the training
of the depth estimator (https://github.com/RavineWindteer/GLPDepth-Edited) and
the mass estimator (https://github.com/RavineWindteer/Depth-mass-estimator) are

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）在生成响应时可能出现与视觉内容不一致的幻觉现象，而人类能够有效利用多模态交互信息避免这一问题。论文旨在探索LVLM的多模态认知行为并提出解决方案。

Method: 提出INTER算法，通过显式引导LVLM在生成响应时重新利用多模态交互信息，无需额外数据或训练。

Conclusion: INTER通过模拟人类多模态认知行为，有效减少了LVLM的幻觉现象，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) pose significant
challenges for real-world applications, as LVLMs may generate responses that
appear plausible yet remain inconsistent with the associated visual content.
This issue rarely occurs in human cognition. We argue that this discrepancy
arises from humans' ability to effectively leverage multimodal interaction
information in data samples. Specifically, humans typically first gather
multimodal information, analyze the interactions across modalities for
understanding, and then express their understanding through language. Motivated
by this observation, we conduct extensive experiments on popular LVLMs and
obtained insights that surprisingly reveal human-like, though less pronounced,
cognitive behavior of LVLMs on multimodal samples. Building on these findings,
we further propose \textbf{INTER}: \textbf{Inter}action Guidance Sampling, a
novel training-free algorithm that mitigate hallucinations without requiring
additional data. Specifically, INTER explicitly guides LVLMs to effectively
reapply their understanding of multimodal interaction information when
generating responses, thereby reducing potential hallucinations. On six
benchmarks including VQA and image captioning tasks, INTER achieves an average
improvement of up to 3.4\% on five LVLMs compared to the state-of-the-art
decoding strategy. The code will be released when the paper is accepted.

Method: 提出了一种包含隐式分类和自适应分数聚合策略的检测方法，适用于视觉自回归模型。

Result: 实验表明该方法在类条件和文本到图像场景中表现优越，并揭示了大型基础模型的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅有效检测训练数据，还揭示了自回归模型在数据隐私方面的潜在风险。

Abstract: Autoregressive image generation has witnessed rapid advancements, with
prominent models such as scale-wise visual auto-regression pushing the
boundaries of visual synthesis. However, these developments also raise
significant concerns regarding data privacy and copyright. In response,
training data detection has emerged as a critical task for identifying
unauthorized data usage in model training. To better understand the
vulnerability of autoregressive image generative models to such detection, we
conduct the first study applying membership inference to this domain. Our
approach comprises two key components: implicit classification and an adaptive
score aggregation strategy. First, we compute the implicit token-wise
classification score within the query image. Then we propose an adaptive score
aggregation strategy to acquire a final score, which places greater emphasis on
the tokens with lower scores. A higher final score indicates that the sample is
more likely to be involved in the training set. To validate the effectiveness
of our method, we adapt existing detection algorithms originally designed for
LLMs to visual autoregressive models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our method in both class-conditional and text-to-image
scenarios. Moreover, our approach exhibits strong robustness and generalization
under various data transformations. Furthermore, sufficient experiments suggest
two novel key findings: (1) A linear scaling law on membership inference,
exposing the vulnerability of large foundation models. (2) Training data from
scale-wise visual autoregressive models is easier to detect than other
autoregressive paradigms.Our code is available at

Motivation: 虚拟助手、视频游戏和电影等应用需要自然的唇部运动，但现有方法存在时间抖动、身份漂移和眨眼不自然等问题。

Method: 结合3DMM与扩散Transformer，采用分层去噪策略、3DMM系数和优化的眨眼策略。

Result: 有效减少时间抖动，保持身份一致性，生成更自然的眨眼行为。

Conclusion: MoDiT框架显著提升了音频驱动说话头生成的质量和一致性。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head generation is critical for applications such as
virtual assistants, video games, and films, where natural lip movements are
essential. Despite progress in this field, challenges remain in producing both
consistent and realistic facial animations. Existing methods, often based on
GANs or UNet-based diffusion models, face three major limitations: (i) temporal
jittering caused by weak temporal constraints, resulting in frame
inconsistencies; (ii) identity drift due to insufficient 3D information
extraction, leading to poor preservation of facial identity; and (iii)
unnatural blinking behavior due to inadequate modeling of realistic blink
dynamics. To address these issues, we propose MoDiT, a novel framework that
combines the 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) with a Diffusion-based Transformer. Our
contributions include: (i) A hierarchical denoising strategy with revised
temporal attention and biased self/cross-attention mechanisms, enabling the
model to refine lip synchronization and progressively enhance full-face
coherence, effectively mitigating temporal jittering. (ii) The integration of
3DMM coefficients to provide explicit spatial constraints, ensuring accurate
3D-informed optical flow prediction and improved lip synchronization using
Wav2Lip results, thereby preserving identity consistency. (iii) A refined
blinking strategy to model natural eye movements, with smoother and more
realistic blinking behaviors.

Conclusion: VOTE框架高效且通用，显著提升VLA模型的性能和效率。

Abstract: Recent large-scale Vision Language Action (VLA) models have shown superior
performance in robotic manipulation tasks guided by natural language. However,
their generalization remains limited when applied to novel objects or
unfamiliar environments that lie outside the training distribution. To address
this, many existing approaches integrate additional components such as depth
estimation, segmentation, or even diffusion to improve generalization, at the
cost of adding significant computation overhead, resulting in low efficiency.
This motivates the exploration of efficient action prediction methods, which
are independent of additional high-level visual representations or diffusion
techniques. In this work, we propose VOTE, an efficient and general framework
for the optimization and acceleration of VLA models. In details, we propose a
novel tokenizer-free fine-tuning approach for parallel accurate action
prediction, which reduces computational overhead and accelerates inference
speed. Additionally, we adopt an ensemble voting strategy for the action
sampling, which significantly improves model performance and enhances
generalization. Experimental results show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance with 35$\times$ faster inference and 145 Hz
throughput. All the details and codes will be open-sourced.

Abstract: The widespread and rapid adoption of AI-generated content, created by models
such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models, has
revolutionized the digital media landscape by allowing efficient and creative
content generation. However, these models also blur the difference between real
images and AI-generated synthetic images, raising concerns regarding content
authenticity and integrity. While many existing solutions to detect fake images
focus solely on classification and higher-resolution images, they often lack
transparency in their decision-making, making it difficult for users to
understand why an image is classified as fake. In this paper, we present
VERITAS, a comprehensive framework that not only accurately detects whether a
small (32x32) image is AI-generated but also explains why it was classified
that way through artifact localization and semantic reasoning. VERITAS produces
human-readable explanations that describe key artifacts in synthetic images. We
show that this architecture offers clear explanations of the basis of zero-shot
synthetic image detection tasks. Code and relevant prompts can be found at

Result: 轻量级模型在对抗条件下仍能保持高精度，且计算和内存成本显著低于现有方法。

Conclusion: 研究为开发高效、可扩展的AIGI检测系统提供了基础，平衡了效率与性能。

Abstract: The recent proliferation of photorealistic AI-generated images (AIGI) has
raised urgent concerns about their potential misuse, particularly on social
media platforms. Current state-of-the-art AIGI detection methods typically rely
on large, deep neural architectures, creating significant computational
barriers to real-time, large-scale deployment on platforms like social media.
To challenge this reliance on computationally intensive models, we introduce
LAID, the first framework -- to our knowledge -- that benchmarks and evaluates
the detection performance and efficiency of off-the-shelf lightweight neural
networks. In this framework, we comprehensively train and evaluate selected
models on a representative subset of the GenImage dataset across spatial,
spectral, and fusion image domains. Our results demonstrate that lightweight
models can achieve competitive accuracy, even under adversarial conditions,
while incurring substantially lower memory and computation costs compared to
current state-of-the-art methods. This study offers valuable insight into the
trade-off between efficiency and performance in AIGI detection and lays a
foundation for the development of practical, scalable, and trustworthy
detection systems. The source code of LAID can be found at:

Motivation: 解决低帧率相机在高速动态场景重建中的限制，避免直接重建导致的不良结果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著优于同步采集，实现了等效100-200 FPS的高质量重建。

Conclusion: 通过异步采集和生成模型，成功实现了低成本的高速4D动态场景重建。

Abstract: Reconstructing fast-dynamic scenes from multi-view videos is crucial for
high-speed motion analysis and realistic 4D reconstruction. However, the
majority of 4D capture systems are limited to frame rates below 30 FPS (frames
per second), and a direct 4D reconstruction of high-speed motion from low FPS
input may lead to undesirable results. In this work, we propose a high-speed 4D
capturing system only using low FPS cameras, through novel capturing and
processing modules. On the capturing side, we propose an asynchronous capture
scheme that increases the effective frame rate by staggering the start times of
cameras. By grouping cameras and leveraging a base frame rate of 25 FPS, our
method achieves an equivalent frame rate of 100-200 FPS without requiring
specialized high-speed cameras. On processing side, we also propose a novel
generative model to fix artifacts caused by 4D sparse-view reconstruction, as
asynchrony reduces the number of viewpoints at each timestamp. Specifically, we
propose to train a video-diffusion-based artifact-fix model for sparse 4D
reconstruction, which refines missing details, maintains temporal consistency,
and improves overall reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method significantly enhances high-speed 4D reconstruction compared to
synchronous capture.

Abstract: Social networks can be a valuable source of information during crisis events.
In particular, users can post a stream of multimodal data that can be critical
for real-time humanitarian response. However, effectively extracting meaningful
information from this large and noisy data stream and effectively integrating
heterogeneous data remains a formidable challenge. In this work, we explore
vision language models (VLMs) and advanced fusion strategies to enhance the
classification of crisis data in three different tasks. We incorporate
LLaVA-generated text to improve text-image alignment. Additionally, we leverage
Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)-based vision and text embeddings,
which, without task-specific fine-tuning, outperform traditional models. To
further refine multimodal fusion, we employ Guided Cross Attention (Guided CA)
and combine it with the Differential Attention mechanism to enhance feature
alignment by emphasizing critical information while filtering out irrelevant
content. Our results show that while Differential Attention improves
classification performance, Guided CA remains highly effective in aligning
multimodal features. Extensive experiments on the CrisisMMD benchmark data set
demonstrate that the combination of pretrained VLMs, enriched textual
descriptions, and adaptive fusion strategies consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art models in classification accuracy, contributing to more
reliable and interpretable models for three different tasks that are crucial
for disaster response. Our code is available at

Conclusion: SemFi模型和SFI-300K为语义帧插值任务提供了有效的解决方案和基准。

Abstract: Generating intermediate video content of varying lengths based on given first
and last frames, along with text prompt information, offers significant
research and application potential. However, traditional frame interpolation
tasks primarily focus on scenarios with a small number of frames, no text
control, and minimal differences between the first and last frames. Recent
community developers have utilized large video models represented by Wan to
endow frame-to-frame capabilities. However, these models can only generate a
fixed number of frames and often fail to produce satisfactory results for
certain frame lengths, while this setting lacks a clear official definition and
a well-established benchmark. In this paper, we first propose a new practical
Semantic Frame Interpolation (SFI) task from the perspective of academic
definition, which covers the above two settings and supports inference at
multiple frame rates. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel SemFi model
building upon Wan2.1, which incorporates a Mixture-of-LoRA module to ensure the
generation of high-consistency content that aligns with control conditions
across various frame length limitations. Furthermore, we propose SFI-300K, the
first general-purpose dataset and benchmark specifically designed for SFI. To
support this, we collect and process data from the perspective of SFI,
carefully designing evaluation metrics and methods to assess the model's
performance across multiple dimensions, encompassing image and video, and
various aspects, including consistency and diversity. Through extensive
experiments on SFI-300K, we demonstrate that our method is particularly
well-suited to meet the requirements of the SFI task.

Abstract: Characterizing quantum flakes is a critical step in quantum hardware
engineering because the quality of these flakes directly influences qubit
performance. Although computer vision methods for identifying two-dimensional
quantum flakes have emerged, they still face significant challenges in
estimating flake thickness. These challenges include limited data, poor
generalization, sensitivity to domain shifts, and a lack of physical
interpretability. In this paper, we introduce one of the first Physics-informed
Adaptation Learning approaches to overcome these obstacles. We focus on two
main issues, i.e., data scarcity and generalization. First, we propose a new
synthetic data generation framework that produces diverse quantum flake samples
across various materials and configurations, reducing the need for
time-consuming manual collection. Second, we present $\varphi$-Adapt, a
physics-informed adaptation method that bridges the performance gap between
models trained on synthetic data and those deployed in real-world settings.
Experimental results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple benchmarks, outperforming existing methods. Our
proposed approach advances the integration of physics-based modeling and domain
adaptation. It also addresses a critical gap in leveraging synthesized data for
real-world 2D material analysis, offering impactful tools for deep learning and
materials science communities.

Abstract: Accurate rice area monitoring is critical for food security and agricultural
policy in smallholder farming regions, yet conventional remote sensing
approaches struggle with the spatiotemporal heterogeneity characteristic of
fragmented agricultural landscapes. This study developed a phenology-driven
classification framework that systematically adapts to local agro-ecological
variations across 32 districts in Telangana, India during the 2018-19 Rabi rice
season. The research reveals significant spatiotemporal diversity, with
phenological timing varying by up to 50 days between districts and field sizes
ranging from 0.01 to 2.94 hectares. Our district-specific calibration approach
achieved 93.3% overall accuracy, an 8.0 percentage point improvement over
conventional regional clustering methods, with strong validation against
official government statistics (R^2 = 0.981) demonstrating excellent agreement
between remotely sensed and ground truth data. The framework successfully
mapped 732,345 hectares by adapting to agro-climatic variations, with Northern
districts requiring extended land preparation phases (up to 55 days) while
Southern districts showed compressed cultivation cycles. Field size analysis
revealed accuracy declining 6.8 percentage points from medium to tiny fields,
providing insights for operational monitoring in fragmented landscapes. These
findings demonstrate that remote sensing frameworks must embrace rather than
simplify landscape complexity, advancing region-specific agricultural
monitoring approaches that maintain scientific rigor while serving practical
policy and food security applications.

Abstract: Unified segmentation of 3D point clouds is crucial for scene understanding,
but is hindered by its sparse structure, limited annotations, and the challenge
of distinguishing fine-grained object classes in complex environments. Existing
methods often struggle to capture rich semantic and contextual information due
to limited supervision and a lack of diverse multimodal cues, leading to
suboptimal differentiation of classes and instances. To address these
challenges, we propose VDG-Uni3DSeg, a novel framework that integrates
pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) and large language models
(LLMs) to enhance 3D segmentation. By leveraging LLM-generated textual
descriptions and reference images from the internet, our method incorporates
rich multimodal cues, facilitating fine-grained class and instance separation.
We further design a Semantic-Visual Contrastive Loss to align point features
with multimodal queries and a Spatial Enhanced Module to model scene-wide
relationships efficiently. Operating within a closed-set paradigm that utilizes
multimodal knowledge generated offline, VDG-Uni3DSeg achieves state-of-the-art
results in semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation, offering a scalable
and practical solution for 3D understanding. Our code is available at

Abstract: Deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide
range of computer vision tasks. However, their performance often degrades
significantly when faced with distribution shifts, such as domain or dataset
changes. Test-Time Training (TTT) has emerged as an effective method to enhance
model robustness by incorporating an auxiliary unsupervised task during
training and leveraging it for model updates at test time. In this work, we
introduce CTA (Cross-Task Alignment), a novel approach for improving TTT.
Unlike existing TTT methods, CTA does not require a specialized model
architecture and instead takes inspiration from the success of multi-modal
contrastive learning to align a supervised encoder with a self-supervised one.
This process enforces alignment between the learned representations of both
models, thereby mitigating the risk of gradient interference, preserving the
intrinsic robustness of self-supervised learning and enabling more semantically
meaningful updates at test-time. Experimental results demonstrate substantial
improvements in robustness and generalization over the state-of-the-art on
several benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于单帧标注的实例关联学习方法，用于解决低帧率无人机视频中的多目标跟踪问题，并在军事车辆数据集上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低帧率无人机视频中，由于目标外观和位置的快速变化以及图像质量下降，多目标跟踪任务变得复杂且具有挑战性。

Method: 通过从单帧标注中学习实例关联，并利用场景的全局特征提供上下文信息，以提高跟踪的鲁棒性和效率。

Result: 该方法在减少输入图像分辨率和潜在表示大小的情况下仍能保持高质量的关联性能，且对干扰物和检测间隙具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在低帧率无人机视频中有效解决了多目标跟踪问题，并通过公开数据集验证了其性能。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) aims to maintain consistent identities of objects
across video frames. Associating objects in low-frame-rate videos captured by
moving unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in actual combat scenarios is complex
due to rapid changes in object appearance and position within the frame. The
task becomes even more challenging due to image degradation caused by cloud
video streaming and compression algorithms. We present how instance association
learning from single-frame annotations can overcome these challenges. We show
that global features of the scene provide crucial context for low-FPS instance
association, allowing our solution to be robust to distractors and gaps in
detections. We also demonstrate that such a tracking approach maintains high
association quality even when reducing the input image resolution and latent
representation size for faster inference. Finally, we present a benchmark
dataset of annotated military vehicles collected from publicly available data
sources. This paper was initially presented at the NATO Science and Technology
Organization Symposium (ICMCIS) organized by the Information Systems Technology
(IST)Scientific and Technical Committee, IST-209-RSY - the ICMCIS, held in
Oeiras, Portugal, 13-14 May 2025.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督的机器学习方法，通过双隐式神经表示框架分离信号中的背景和失真，无需标记数据或预定义字典。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实验和观测数据中因背景和信号失真导致的有用信息被掩盖的问题。

Method: 使用双神经网络框架，一个学习信号失真，另一个学习背景贡献，通过最小化重构损失函数直接从原始数据中学习。

Result: 在四维参数空间的大规模模拟和实验数据中成功分离出物理相关信号。

Conclusion: 该方法为多领域中的信号分离问题提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: Significant challenges exist in efficient data analysis of most advanced
experimental and observational techniques because the collected signals often
include unwanted contributions--such as background and signal distortions--that
can obscure the physically relevant information of interest. To address this,
we have developed a self-supervised machine-learning approach for source
separation using a dual implicit neural representation framework that jointly
trains two neural networks: one for approximating distortions of the physical
signal of interest and the other for learning the effective background
contribution. Our method learns directly from the raw data by minimizing a
reconstruction-based loss function without requiring labeled data or
pre-defined dictionaries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by
considering a challenging case study involving large-scale simulated as well as
experimental momentum-energy-dependent inelastic neutron scattering data in a
four-dimensional parameter space, characterized by heterogeneous background
contributions and unknown distortions to the target signal. The method is found
to successfully separate physically meaningful signals from a complex or
structured background even when the signal characteristics vary across all four
dimensions of the parameter space. An analytical approach that informs the
choice of the regularization parameter is presented. Our method offers a
versatile framework for addressing source separation problems across diverse
domains, ranging from superimposed signals in astronomical measurements to
structural features in biomedical image reconstructions.

Abstract: Accurate motion prediction of surrounding traffic participants is crucial for
the safe and efficient operation of automated vehicles in dynamic environments.
Marginal prediction models commonly forecast each agent's future trajectories
independently, often leading to sub-optimal planning decisions for an automated
vehicle. In contrast, joint prediction models explicitly account for the
interactions between agents, yielding socially and physically consistent
predictions on a scene level. However, existing approaches differ not only in
their problem formulation but also in the model architectures and
implementation details used, making it difficult to compare them. In this work,
we systematically investigate different approaches to joint motion prediction,
including post-processing of the marginal predictions, explicitly training the
model for joint predictions, and framing the problem as a generative task. We
evaluate each approach in terms of prediction accuracy, multi-modality, and
inference efficiency, offering a comprehensive analysis of the strengths and
limitations of each approach. Several prediction examples are available at

TL;DR: SegmentDreamer提出了一种新框架，通过Segmented Consistency Trajectory Distillation（SCTD）解决CD方法中自一致性和跨一致性的不平衡问题，提升文本到3D生成的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Consistency Distillation（CD）的方法因自一致性和跨一致性的不平衡导致条件引导不当，生成结果不理想。

Method: 提出SCTD，通过分段定义自一致性和跨一致性的关系，并将PF-ODE轨迹划分为多个子轨迹，确保每段内的一致性。

Result: 实验表明SegmentDreamer在视觉质量上优于现有方法，支持通过3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）生成高保真3D资产。

Conclusion: SegmentDreamer通过SCTD有效解决了CD方法的局限性，显著提升了文本到3D生成的质量和效率。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-3D generation improve the visual quality of
Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) and its variants by directly connecting
Consistency Distillation (CD) to score distillation. However, due to the
imbalance between self-consistency and cross-consistency, these CD-based
methods inherently suffer from improper conditional guidance, leading to
sub-optimal generation results. To address this issue, we present
SegmentDreamer, a novel framework designed to fully unleash the potential of
consistency models for high-fidelity text-to-3D generation. Specifically, we
reformulate SDS through the proposed Segmented Consistency Trajectory
Distillation (SCTD), effectively mitigating the imbalance issues by explicitly
defining the relationship between self- and cross-consistency. Moreover, SCTD
partitions the Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE)
trajectory into multiple sub-trajectories and ensures consistency within each
segment, which can theoretically provide a significantly tighter upper bound on
distillation error. Additionally, we propose a distillation pipeline for a more
swift and stable generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
SegmentDreamer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality, enabling
high-fidelity 3D asset creation through 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS).

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ST-LLM的模型，用于解决多模态大语言模型在时空理解上的不足，并通过REA数据集验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在需要整体时空理解的提示上表现不佳，这对现实世界中的智能体操作至关重要。

Method: 开发了一个框架来收集大规模数据集（REA），并提出了ST-LLM模型，该模型通过投影器提升空间环境和时间观察的理解能力。

Result: 在REA数据集上，ST-LLM显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ST-LLM通过改进时空理解能力，为多模态大语言模型在复杂任务中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the significant recent progress of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), MLLMs still struggle to correctly answer prompts that require a
holistic spatio-temporal understanding. Specifically, it is challenging to
address prompts that refer to 1) the entirety of an environment that an agent
equipped with an MLLM can operate in; and simultaneously also refer to 2)
recent actions that just happened and are encoded in a video clip. However,
such a holistic spatio-temporal understanding is important for agents operating
in the real world. To address this issue, we first develop a framework to
collect a large-scale dataset. Using the collected "Reasoning about
Environments and Actions" (REA) dataset, we show that recent methods indeed
struggle to correctly answer the prompts. To improve, we develop a
"spatio-temporal LLM" (ST-LLM), a model equipped with projectors to improve
both spatial understanding of an environment and temporal understanding of
recent observations. On the collected REA data, we show that the proposed
method significantly improves results compared to prior work. Code and data are
available at https://zoezheng126.github.io/STLLM-website/.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型在复杂指令理解和身份保持上表现不佳，且依赖手动掩码，X-Planner旨在解决这些问题。

Method: X-Planner利用链式思维推理分解指令，自动生成编辑类型和分割掩码，并通过新提出的自动化管道生成训练数据。

Result: X-Planner在现有基准和新提出的复杂编辑基准上均取得最先进结果。

Conclusion: X-Planner通过系统化规划和自动化数据生成，显著提升了复杂指令下的图像编辑效果。

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based image editing methods have significantly advanced
text-guided tasks but often struggle to interpret complex, indirect
instructions. Moreover, current models frequently suffer from poor identity
preservation, unintended edits, or rely heavily on manual masks. To address
these challenges, we introduce X-Planner, a Multimodal Large Language Model
(MLLM)-based planning system that effectively bridges user intent with editing
model capabilities. X-Planner employs chain-of-thought reasoning to
systematically decompose complex instructions into simpler, clear
sub-instructions. For each sub-instruction, X-Planner automatically generates
precise edit types and segmentation masks, eliminating manual intervention and
ensuring localized, identity-preserving edits. Additionally, we propose a novel
automated pipeline for generating large-scale data to train X-Planner which
achieves state-of-the-art results on both existing benchmarks and our newly
introduced complex editing benchmark.

Abstract: LiDAR representation learning aims to extract rich structural and semantic
information from large-scale, readily available datasets, reducing reliance on
costly human annotations. However, existing LiDAR representation strategies
often overlook the inherent spatiotemporal cues in LiDAR sequences, limiting
their effectiveness. In this work, we propose LiMA, a novel long-term
image-to-LiDAR Memory Aggregation framework that explicitly captures longer
range temporal correlations to enhance LiDAR representation learning. LiMA
comprises three key components: 1) a Cross-View Aggregation module that aligns
and fuses overlapping regions across neighboring camera views, constructing a
more unified and redundancy-free memory bank; 2) a Long-Term Feature
Propagation mechanism that efficiently aligns and integrates multi-frame image
features, reinforcing temporal coherence during LiDAR representation learning;
and 3) a Cross-Sequence Memory Alignment strategy that enforces consistency
across driving sequences, improving generalization to unseen environments. LiMA
maintains high pretraining efficiency and incurs no additional computational
overhead during downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on mainstream
LiDAR-based perception benchmarks demonstrate that LiMA significantly improves
both LiDAR semantic segmentation and 3D object detection. We hope this work
inspires more effective pretraining paradigms for autonomous driving. The code
has be made publicly accessible for future research.
