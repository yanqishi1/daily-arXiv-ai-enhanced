However, a persistent and\nsubstantial gap remains between algorithm design and hardware implementation.\nBridging this gap traditionally requires extensive domain expertise and\ntime-consuming manual development, due to fundamental mismatches between\nhigh-level programming languages like MATLAB and hardware description languages\n(HDLs) such as Verilog-in terms of memory access patterns, data processing\nmanners, and datatype representations. To address this challenge, we propose\nA2HCoder: a Hierarchical Algorithm-to-HDL Coding Agent, powered by large\nlanguage models (LLMs), designed to enable agile and reliable\nalgorithm-to-hardware translation. A2HCoder introduces a hierarchical framework\nthat enhances both robustness and interpretability while suppressing common\nhallucination issues in LLM-generated code. In the horizontal dimension,\nA2HCoder decomposes complex algorithms into modular functional blocks,\nsimplifying code generation and improving consistency.

However, in extreme degradation scenarios\n(e.g., scale $> 8\\times$), critical attributes and ID information are often\nseverely lost in the input image, making it difficult for conventional models\nto reconstruct realistic and ID-consistent faces. Existing methods tend to\ngenerate hallucinated faces under such conditions, producing restored images\nlacking authentic ID constraints. To address this challenge, we propose a novel\nFSR method with Identity Decoupling and Fitting (IDFSR), designed to enhance ID\nrestoration under large scaling factors while mitigating hallucination effects.\nOur approach involves three key designs: 1) \\textbf{Masking} the facial region\nin the low-resolution (LR) image to eliminate unreliable ID cues; 2)\n\\textbf{Warping} a reference image to align with the LR input, providing style\nguidance; 3) Leveraging \\textbf{ID embeddings} extracted from ground truth (GT)\nimages for fine-grained ID modeling and personalized adaptation. We first\npretrain a diffusion-based model to explicitly decouple style and ID by forcing\nit to reconstruct masked LR face regions using both style and identity\nembeddings. Subsequently, we freeze most network parameters and perform\nlightweight fine-tuning of the ID embedding using a small set of target ID\nimages. This embedding encodes fine-grained facial attributes and precise ID\ninformation, significantly improving both ID consistency and perceptual\nquality.

Alerting to the presence of these objects is\ntherefore the first step for motivating follow-up further inspection and\ntriggering digital material attached to the objects. This work studies a\nspecial kind of these objects -- Artcodes -- a human-meaningful and\nmachine-readable decorative markers that camouflage themselves with freeform\nappearance by encoding information into their topology. We formulate this\nproblem of recongising the presence of Artcodes as Artcode proposal detection,\na distinct computer vision task that classifies topologically similar but\ngeometrically and semantically different objects as a same class. To deal with\nthis problem, we propose a new feature descriptor, called the shape of\norientation histogram, to describe the generic topological structure of an\nArtcode.

We curated a large, self-annotated dataset of over 7,000\nframes captured across various road types, lighting conditions, and weather\nscenarios unique to Indian environments, leveraging dashcam footage. This\ndataset is used to fine-tune, Ultralytics You Only Look Once (YOLO) model to\nperform real time pothole detection, while a custom Optical Character\nRecognition (OCR) module was employed to extract timestamps directly from video\nframes. The timestamps are synchronized with GPS logs to geotag each detected\npotholes accurately. The processed data includes the potholes' details and\nframes as metadata is stored in a database and visualized via a user friendly\nweb interface using OSM. iWatchRoad not only improves detection accuracy under\nchallenging conditions but also provides government compatible outputs for road\nassessment and maintenance planning through the metadata visible on the\nwebsite.

Traditional\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods primarily focus on coarse-grained\ntextual semantic similarity and ignore structural associations among dispersed\nknowledge, which limits their effectiveness in MHQA tasks.

Semantically, we design a hypergraph retrieval method that integrates\nfine-grained entity similarity and coarse-grained passage similarity via\nhypergraph diffusion. Finally, we employ a retrieval enhancement module, which\nfurther refines the retrieved results both semantically and structurally, to\nobtain the most relevant passages as context for answer generation with the\nLLM. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods in QA performance, and achieves a\n6$\\times$ speedup in retrieval efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "HGRAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u56fe\u6574\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b06\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfRAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u5ffd\u89c6\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u800cGraphRAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u4e49\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHGRAG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5b9e\u4f53\u8d85\u56fe\uff08\u8282\u70b9\u4e3a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5b9e\u4f53\uff0c\u8d85\u8fb9\u4e3a\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u6bb5\u843d\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u56fe\u6269\u6563\u6574\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHGRAG\u5728\u95ee\u7b54\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u53476\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "HGRAG\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u7c92\u5ea6\u6574\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u6548\u679c\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

With AI, we can now extract detailed\nmeasurements of size, shape, and fat content from abdominal structures in 3D\nclinical imaging at scale. This creates an opportunity to empirically define\nbody composition signatures linked to type 2 diabetes risk and protection using\nlarge-scale clinical data. Approach: To uncover BMI-specific diabetic abdominal\npatterns from clinical CT, we applied our design four times: once on the full\ncohort (n = 1,728) and once on lean (n = 497), overweight (n = 611), and obese\n(n = 620) subgroups separately. Briefly, our experimental design transforms\nabdominal scans into collections of explainable measurements through\nsegmentation, classifies type 2 diabetes through a cross-validated random\nforest, measures how features contribute to model-estimated risk or protection\nthrough SHAP analysis, groups scans by shared model decision patterns\n(clustering from SHAP) and links back to anatomical differences\n(classification). Results: The random-forests achieved mean AUCs of 0.72-0.74.\nThere were shared type 2 diabetes signatures in each group; fatty skeletal\nmuscle, older age, greater visceral and subcutaneous fat, and a smaller or\nfat-laden pancreas.

In the first\nstage, we employ the EM algorithm to decouple the joint distribution of paired\nhazy and clear images into two conditional distributions, which are then\nmodeled using a unified Brownian Bridge diffusion model to directly capture the\nstructural and content-related correlations between hazy and clear images. In\nthe second stage, we leverage the pre-trained model and large-scale unpaired\nhazy and clear images to further improve the performance of image dehazing.\nAdditionally, we introduce a detail-enhanced Residual Difference Convolution\nblock (RDC) to capture gradient-level information, significantly enhancing the\nmodel's representation capability.

However, in real-world remote-sensing scenarios, privacy and\ntransmission constraints often preclude access to source domain data, which\nlimits their practical applicability. Recently, Source-Free Object Detection\n(SFOD) has emerged as a promising alternative, aiming at cross-domain\nadaptation without relying on source data, primarily through a self-training\nparadigm. Despite its potential, SFOD frequently suffers from training collapse\ncaused by noisy pseudo-labels, especially in remote sensing imagery with dense\nobjects and complex backgrounds. Considering that limited target domain\nannotations are often feasible in practice, we propose a Vision\nfoundation-Guided DEtection TRansformer (VG-DETR), built upon a semi-supervised\nframework for SFOD in remote sensing images. VG-DETR integrates a Vision\nFoundation Model (VFM) into the training pipeline in a \"free lunch\" manner,\nleveraging a small amount of labeled target data to mitigate pseudo-label noise\nwhile improving the detector's feature-extraction capability. Specifically, we\nintroduce a VFM-guided pseudo-label mining strategy that leverages the VFM's\nsemantic priors to further assess the reliability of the generated\npseudo-labels. By recovering potentially correct predictions from\nlow-confidence outputs, our strategy improves pseudo-label quality and\nquantity. In addition, a dual-level VFM-guided alignment method is proposed,\nwhich aligns detector features with VFM embeddings at both the instance and\nimage levels. Through contrastive learning among fine-grained prototypes and\nsimilarity matching between feature maps, this dual-level alignment further\nenhances the robustness of feature representations against domain gaps.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that VG-DETR achieves superior performance in\nsource-free remote sensing detection tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "VG-DETR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u6e90\u81ea\u7531\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08SFOD\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5c11\u91cf\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9065\u611f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u6e90\u57df\u6570\u636e\u5e38\u56e0\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u4f20\u8f93\u9650\u5236\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f20\u7edf\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u3002SFOD\u867d\u65e0\u9700\u6e90\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u6613\u56e0\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "method": "VG-DETR\u5f15\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08VFM\uff09\u6307\u5bfc\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u6316\u6398\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea7\uff09\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cVG-DETR\u5728\u6e90\u81ea\u7531\u9065\u611f\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "VG-DETR\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408VFM\u548c\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86SFOD\u4e2d\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

For IR, we employ a\ncontrastive loss with multiple positives and hard negatives, augmented by\ncross-device sampling. For STS, we adopt order-aware objectives that directly\noptimize correlation and ranking consistency. (2) A delta-guided model fusion\nstrategy that computes fine-grained merging weights for checkpoints by\nanalyzing each parameter's deviation from its pre-trained initialization,\nproving more effective than traditional Model Soups.

Building on research on fairness and\ndiscrimination in AI, we investigate whether LLMs exhibit speciesist bias --\ndiscrimination based on species membership -- and how they value non-human\nanimals. We systematically examine this issue across three paradigms: (1)\nSpeciesismBench, a 1,003-item benchmark assessing recognition and moral\nevaluation of speciesist statements; (2) established psychological measures\ncomparing model responses with those of human participants; (3) text-generation\ntasks probing elaboration on, or resistance to, speciesist rationalizations. In\nour benchmark, LLMs reliably detected speciesist statements but rarely\ncondemned them, often treating speciesist attitudes as morally acceptable. On\npsychological measures, results were mixed: LLMs expressed slightly lower\nexplicit speciesism than people, yet in direct trade-offs they more often chose\nto save one human over multiple animals. A tentative interpretation is that\nLLMs may weight cognitive capacity rather than species per se: when capacities\nwere equal, they showed no species preference, and when an animal was described\nas more capable, they tended to prioritize it over a less capable human. In\nopen-ended text generation tasks, LLMs frequently normalized or rationalized\nharm toward farmed animals while refusing to do so for non-farmed animals.\nThese findings suggest that while LLMs reflect a mixture of progressive and\nmainstream human views, they nonetheless reproduce entrenched cultural norms\naround animal exploitation.

This is due to the\ndifficulty of optimizing among competing preference objectives, which often\nconflict with one another, and the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality\ndatasets with multidimensional preference annotations. To address these, we\nfirst introduce Talking-Critic, a multimodal reward model that learns\nhuman-aligned reward functions to quantify how well generated videos satisfy\nmultidimensional expectations. Leveraging this model, we curate Talking-NSQ, a\nlarge-scale multidimensional human preference dataset containing 410K\npreference pairs. Finally, we propose Timestep-Layer adaptive multi-expert\nPreference Optimization (TLPO), a novel framework for aligning diffusion-based\nportrait animation models with fine-grained, multidimensional preferences. TLPO\ndecouples preferences into specialized expert modules, which are then fused\nacross timesteps and network layers, enabling comprehensive, fine-grained\nenhancement across all dimensions without mutual interference. Experiments\ndemonstrate that Talking-Critic significantly outperforms existing methods in\naligning with human preference ratings. Meanwhile, TLPO achieves substantial\nimprovements over baseline models in lip-sync accuracy, motion naturalness, and\nvisual quality, exhibiting superior performance in both qualitative and\nquantitative evaluations.

To ensure accurate registration of\nthe synthesised pseudo-RGBD frames from MAPIS-Depth, a novel WEMA-RTDL module\nis integrated, optimising both rotation and translation.

To mitigate these problems, some pioneering studies leverage powerful\ngenerative models (e.g., pretrained diffusion models) to realize generalizable\nimage classification, dubbed Diffusion Classifier (DC). Specifically, by\nrandomly sampling a Gaussian noise, DC utilizes the differences of denoising\neffects with different category conditions to classify categories.\nUnfortunately, an inherent and notorious weakness of existing DCs is noise\ninstability: different random sampled noises lead to significant performance\nchanges. To achieve stable classification performance, existing DCs always\nensemble the results of hundreds of sampled noises, which significantly reduces\nthe classification speed. To this end, we firstly explore the role of noise in\nDC, and conclude that: there are some ``good noises'' that can relieve the\ninstability. Meanwhile, we argue that these good noises should meet two\nprinciples: Frequency Matching and Spatial Matching. Regarding both principles,\nwe propose a novel Noise Optimization method to learn matching (i.e., good)\nnoise for DCs: NoOp. For frequency matching, NoOp first optimizes a\ndataset-specific noise: Given a dataset and a timestep t, optimize one randomly\ninitialized parameterized noise. For Spatial Matching, NoOp trains a\nMeta-Network that adopts an image as input and outputs image-specific noise\noffset. The sum of optimized noise and noise offset will be used in DC to\nreplace random noise.

Specifically, they utilize Hungarian Matching to build a\ncorrespondence between the queries of the last-phase and current-phase\ndetection models and align the classifier and regressor outputs between matched\nqueries to avoid knowledge forgetting. However, we observe that in IOD task,\nHungarian Matching is not a good choice. With Hungarian Matching, the query of\nthe current-phase model may match different queries of the last-phase model at\ndifferent iterations during KD. As a result, the knowledge encoded in each\nquery may be reshaped towards new categories, leading to the forgetting of\npreviously encoded knowledge of old categories. Based on our observations, we\npropose a new distillation approach named Index-Aligned Query Distillation\n(IAQD) for transformer-based IOD. Beyond using Hungarian Matching, IAQD\nestablishes a correspondence between queries of the previous and current phase\nmodels that have the same index. Moreover, we perform index-aligned\ndistillation only on partial queries which are critical for the detection of\nprevious categories. In this way, IAQD largely preserves the previous semantic\nand spatial encoding capabilities without interfering with the learning of new\ncategories. Extensive experiments on representative benchmarks demonstrate that\nIAQD effectively mitigates knowledge forgetting, achieving new state-of-the-art\nperformance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aIAQD\u7684\u65b0\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u589e\u91cf\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u589e\u91cf\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5308\u7259\u5229\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u77e5\u8bc6\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4fdd\u6301\u65e7\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faIndex-Aligned Query Distillation (IAQD)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7d22\u5f15\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u5173\u952e\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5e72\u6270\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cIAQD\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "IAQD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u589e\u91cf\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

One\nsuch model, Skeleton Recall Loss (SRL) proposed by Kirchhoff et al.~\\cite\n{kirchhoff2024srl}, was stated to produce state-of-the-art results on benchmark\ntubular datasets. In this work, we performed a theoretical analysis of the\ngradients for the SRL loss. Upon comparing the performance of the proposed\nmethod on some of the tubular datasets (used in the original work, along with\nsome additional datasets), we found that the performance of SRL-based\nsegmentation models did not exceed traditional baseline models. By providing\nboth a theoretical explanation and empirical evidence, this work critically\nevaluates the limitations of topology-based loss functions, offering valuable\ninsights for researchers aiming to develop more effective segmentation models\nfor complex tubular structures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9Skeleton Recall Loss\uff08SRL\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u7ba1\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e76\u672a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u62d3\u6251\u4fdd\u6301\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u5982SRL\uff09\u5728\u7ba1\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9SRL\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u7ba1\u72b6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "SRL\u5728\u7ba1\u72b6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u672a\u8d85\u8fc7\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u62d3\u6251\u4fdd\u6301\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7ba1\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

While supervised deep\nlearning approaches achieve high segmentation accuracy, their reliance on\nextensive pixel-level annotation renders them impractical for clinical\nworkflows. Few-shot learning can reduce this annotation burden but often\nstruggles to capture the fine structural details necessary for GBM analysis. In\nthis study, we introduce CoFi, a fast and efficient coarse-to-fine few-shot\nsegmentation pipeline designed for GBM delineation in EM images. CoFi first\ntrains a lightweight neural network using only three annotated images to\nproduce an initial coarse segmentation mask. This mask is then automatically\nprocessed to generate high-quality point prompts with morphology-aware pruning,\nwhich are subsequently used to guide SAM in refining the segmentation. The\nproposed method achieved exceptional GBM segmentation performance, with a Dice\ncoefficient of 74.54% and an inference speed of 1.9 FPS. We demonstrate that\nCoFi not only alleviates the annotation and computational burdens associated\nwith conventional methods, but also achieves accurate and reliable segmentation\nresults.

Existing methods primarily follow a perception-planning paradigm, where\nperception and planning are executed sequentially within a fully differentiable\nframework for planning-oriented optimization.

This design facilitates targeted perception guided by\nevolving planning objectives over time, ultimately enhancing planning\nperformance. Building on this insight, we introduce VeteranAD, a coupled\nperception and planning framework for end-to-end autonomous driving.

A growing body of works have\nemerged to address insufficient anomaly data via anomaly generation. However,\nthese anomaly generation methods suffer from lack of fidelity or need to be\ntrained with extra data. To this end, we propose a training-free anomaly\ngeneration framework dubbed AAG, which is based on Stable Diffusion (SD)'s\nstrong generation ability for effective anomaly image generation. Given a\nnormal image, mask and a simple text prompt, AAG can generate realistic and\nnatural anomalies in the specific regions and simultaneously keep contents in\nother regions unchanged. In particular, we propose Cross-Attention Enhancement\n(CAE) to re-engineer the cross-attention mechanism within Stable Diffusion\nbased on the given mask. CAE increases the similarity between visual tokens in\nspecific regions and text embeddings, which guides these generated visual\ntokens in accordance with the text description. Besides, generated anomalies\nneed to be more natural and plausible with object in given image.

Despite the growing interest and efforts in this\nfield, several issues remain unresolved, including (1) data unavailability, (2)\nlack of an effective trajectory-based framework, and (3) requirement for\nsufficient supervision labels. In this paper, we present TrajSV, a\ntrajectory-based framework that addresses various issues in existing studies.\nTrajSV comprises three components: data preprocessing, Clip Representation\nNetwork (CRNet), and Video Representation Network (VRNet). The data\npreprocessing module extracts player and ball trajectories from sports\nbroadcast videos. CRNet utilizes a trajectory-enhanced Transformer module to\nlearn clip representations based on these trajectories. Additionally, VRNet\nlearns video representations by aggregating clip representations and visual\nfeatures with an encoder-decoder architecture. Finally, a triple contrastive\nloss is introduced to optimize both video and clip representations in an\nunsupervised manner. The experiments are conducted on three broadcast video\ndatasets to verify the effectiveness of TrajSV for three types of sports (i.e.,\nsoccer, basketball, and volleyball) with three downstream applications (i.e.,\nsports video retrieval, action spotting, and video captioning). The results\ndemonstrate that TrajSV achieves state-of-the-art performance in sports video\nretrieval, showcasing a nearly 70% improvement. It outperforms baselines in\naction spotting, achieving state-of-the-art results in 9 out of 17 action\ncategories, and demonstrates a nearly 20% improvement in video captioning.\nAdditionally, we introduce a deployed system along with the three applications\nbased on TrajSV.", "AI": {"tldr": "TrajSV\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f53\u80b2\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u6570\u636e\u9884\u5904\u7406\u3001CRNet\u548cVRNet\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4f53\u80b2\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u5b57\u5e55\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f53\u80b2\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u8f68\u8ff9\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTrajSV\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6570\u636e\u9884\u5904\u7406\u3001Clip Representation Network (CRNet)\u548cVideo Representation Network (VRNet)\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u4e09\u91cd\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u4f18\u5316\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4f53\u80b2\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u5b57\u5e55\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534770%\uff0c\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u572817\u7c7b\u4e2d9\u7c7b\u9886\u5148\uff0c\u5b57\u5e55\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534720%\u3002", "conclusion": "TrajSV\u5728\u4f53\u80b2\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

However, temporal understanding, which involves identifying\nevent order, duration, and relationships across time, still remains a core\nchallenge.

Surprisingly, we find that removing or\nmodifying PEs in video inputs yields minimal degradation in the performance of\ntemporal understanding. In contrast, reversing the frame sequence while\npreserving the original PEs causes a substantial drop. To explain this\nbehavior, we conduct substantial analysis experiments to trace how temporal\ninformation is integrated within the model.

This emergent mechanism shows that temporal reasoning emerges\nfrom inter-visual token interactions under the constraints of causal attention,\nwhich implicitly encodes temporal structure. Based on these insights, we\npropose two efficiency-oriented strategies: staged cross-modal attention and a\ntemporal exit mechanism for early token truncation.

However, existing approaches struggle\nto effectively compose multiple LoRA adapters, particularly in open-ended\nsettings where the number and nature of required skills are not known in\nadvance. In this work, we present LoRAtorio, a novel train-free framework for\nmulti-LoRA composition that leverages intrinsic model behaviour. Our method is\nmotivated by two key observations: (1) LoRA adapters trained on narrow domains\nproduce denoised outputs that diverge from the base model, and (2) when\noperating out-of-distribution, LoRA outputs show behaviour closer to the base\nmodel than when conditioned in distribution. The balance between these two\nobservations allows for exceptional performance in the single LoRA scenario,\nwhich nevertheless deteriorates when multiple LoRAs are loaded. Our method\noperates in the latent space by dividing it into spatial patches and computing\ncosine similarity between each patch's predicted noise and that of the base\nmodel. These similarities are used to construct a spatially-aware weight\nmatrix, which guides a weighted aggregation of LoRA outputs. To address domain\ndrift, we further propose a modification to classifier-free guidance that\nincorporates the base model's unconditional score into the composition. We\nextend this formulation to a dynamic module selection setting, enabling\ninference-time selection of relevant LoRA adapters from a large pool.

In this paper, we make a preliminary attempt in this\ndirection by introducing Thyme (Think Beyond Images), a novel paradigm for\nenabling MLLMs to transcend existing ``think with images'' approaches by\nautonomously generating and executing diverse image processing and\ncomputational operations via executable code. This approach not only\nfacilitates a rich, on-the-fly set of image manipulations (e.g., cropping,\nrotation, contrast enhancement) but also allows for mathematical computations,\nall while maintaining high autonomy in deciding when and how to apply these\noperations. We activate this capability through a two-stage training strategy:\nan initial SFT on a curated dataset of 500K samples to teach code generation,\nfollowed by a RL phase to refine decision-making. For the RL stage, we manually\ncollect and design high-resolution question-answer pairs to increase the\nlearning difficulty, and we propose GRPO-ATS (Group Relative Policy\nOptimization with Adaptive Temperature Sampling), an algorithm that applies\ndistinct temperatures to text and code generation to balance reasoning\nexploration with code execution precision.
