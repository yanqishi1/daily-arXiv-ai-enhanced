Abstract: The discipline of physics stands as a cornerstone of human intellect, driving
the evolution of technology and deepening our understanding of the fundamental
principles of the cosmos. Contemporary literature includes some works centered
on the task of solving physics problems - a crucial domain of natural language
reasoning. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of frontier LLMs in
solving physics problems, both mathematical and descriptive. We also employ a
plethora of inference-time techniques and agentic frameworks to improve the
performance of the models. This includes the verification of proposed solutions
in a cumulative fashion by other, smaller LLM agents, and we perform a
comparative analysis of the performance that the techniques entail. There are
significant improvements when the multi-agent framework is applied to problems
that the models initially perform poorly on. Furthermore, we introduce a new
evaluation benchmark for physics problems, ${\rm P{\small HYSICS}E{\small
VAL}}$, consisting of 19,609 problems sourced from various physics textbooks
and their corresponding correct solutions scraped from physics forums and
educational websites. Our code and data are publicly available at
https://github.com/areebuzair/PhysicsEval.

### [2] [Do LLMs produce texts with "human-like" lexical diversity?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00086)
*Kelly Kendro,Jeffrey Maloney,Scott Jarvis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究比较了四种ChatGPT模型与人类写作的词汇多样性，发现LLM生成的文本在词汇多样性上与人类写作有显著差异，且新版模型更不像人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM生成的文本在词汇多样性上是否真正接近人类写作。

Method: 测量六种词汇多样性维度，比较四种ChatGPT模型与240名L1/L2英语参与者的文本。

Result: LLM文本与人类文本在词汇多样性上差异显著，新版模型差异更大。

Conclusion: LLM在词汇多样性上未达到人类水平，新版模型表现更差，对语言教学有启示。

Abstract: The degree to which LLMs produce writing that is truly human-like remains
unclear despite the extensive empirical attention that this question has
received. The present study addresses this question from the perspective of
lexical diversity. Specifically, the study investigates patterns of lexical
diversity in LLM-generated texts from four ChatGPT models (-3.5, -4, -o4 mini,
and -4.5) in comparison with texts written by L1 and L2 English participants (n
= 240) across four education levels. Six dimensions of lexical diversity were
measured in each text: volume, abundance, variety-repetition, evenness,
disparity, and dispersion. Results from one-way MANOVAs, one-way ANOVAS, and
Support Vector Machines revealed that the LLM-generated texts differed
significantly from human-written texts for each variable, with ChatGPT-o4 mini
and -4.5 differing the most. Within these two groups, ChatGPT-4.5 demonstrated
higher levels of lexical diversity despite producing fewer tokens. The human
writers' lexical diversity did not differ across subgroups (i.e., education,
language status). Altogether, the results indicate that LLMs do not produce
human-like texts in relation to lexical diversity, and the newer LLMs produce
less human-like texts than older models. We discuss the implications of these
results for language pedagogy and related applications.

### [3] [Semiotic Complexity and Its Epistemological Implications for Modeling Culture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00095)
*Zachary K. Stine,James E. Deitrick*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文呼吁计算人文学科中方法论的更多理论化，以避免翻译错误并提升解释透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为计算人文学科的成熟提供认识论和解释的清晰性。

Method: 将建模工作视为文化、语言领域与计算、数学领域之间的翻译过程。

Result: 指出当前建模实践中因忽视符号复杂性而导致的翻译错误。

Conclusion: 提出建议以帮助研究者更好地处理认识论问题。

Abstract: Greater theorizing of methods in the computational humanities is needed for
epistemological and interpretive clarity, and therefore the maturation of the
field. In this paper, we frame such modeling work as engaging in translation
work from a cultural, linguistic domain into a computational, mathematical
domain, and back again. Translators benefit from articulating the theory of
their translation process, and so do computational humanists in their work --
to ensure internal consistency, avoid subtle yet consequential translation
errors, and facilitate interpretive transparency. Our contribution in this
paper is to lay out a particularly consequential dimension of the lack of
theorizing and the sorts of translation errors that emerge in our modeling
practices as a result. Along these lines we introduce the idea of semiotic
complexity as the degree to which the meaning of some text may vary across
interpretive lenses, and make the case that dominant modeling practices --
especially around evaluation -- commit a translation error by treating
semiotically complex data as semiotically simple when it seems
epistemologically convenient by conferring superficial clarity. We then lay out
several recommendations for researchers to better account for these
epistemological issues in their own work.

### [4] [FACTORY: A Challenging Human-Verified Prompt Set for Long-Form Factuality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00109)
*Mingda Chen,Yang Li,Xilun Chen,Adina Williams,Gargi Ghosh,Scott Yih*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FACTORY是一个大规模、人工验证的提示集，用于评估模型生成准确、全面回答的能力，结果显示现有模型在FACTORY上的表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准缺乏人工验证，可能导致质量不佳，因此开发了FACTORY以提高评估可靠性。

Method: 采用模型循环和人工精炼的方法构建FACTORY，并对比评估6种先进语言模型。

Result: FACTORY更具挑战性，约40%的SOTA模型回答不准确，而其他数据集仅10%。

Conclusion: FACTORY是一个可靠的基准，强调模型需具备长尾事实推理能力。

Abstract: Long-form factuality evaluation assesses the ability of models to generate
accurate, comprehensive responses to short prompts. Existing benchmarks often
lack human verification, leading to potential quality issues. To address this
limitation, we introduce FACTORY, a large-scale, human-verified prompt set.
Developed using a model-in-the-loop approach and refined by humans, FACTORY
includes challenging prompts that are fact-seeking, answerable, and
unambiguous. We conduct human evaluations on 6 state-of-the-art language models
using FACTORY and existing datasets. Our results show that FACTORY is a
challenging benchmark: approximately 40% of the claims made in the responses of
SOTA models are not factual, compared to only 10% for other datasets. Our
analysis identifies the strengths of FACTORY over prior benchmarks, emphasizing
its reliability and the necessity for models to reason across long-tailed
facts.

### [5] [Is neural semantic parsing good at ellipsis resolution, or isn't it?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00121)
*Xiao Zhang,Johan bos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了神经语义解析器在强上下文敏感现象（如英语动词短语省略）上的表现，发现尽管其在标准测试集上表现优异，但在省略现象上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨神经语义解析器在处理需要大量语义信息复制的上下文敏感现象（如动词短语省略）时的能力。

Method: 构建了一个包含120个省略案例及其完整语义表示的语料库，并作为挑战集测试多种神经语义解析器。

Result: 解析器在标准测试集上表现良好（语义匹配分数超过90%），但在省略案例上表现失败。

Conclusion: 神经语义解析器在处理上下文敏感现象（如省略）时存在局限性，数据增强可能是一种改进方向。

Abstract: Neural semantic parsers have shown good overall performance for a variety of
linguistic phenomena, reaching semantic matching scores of more than 90%. But
how do such parsers perform on strongly context-sensitive phenomena, where
large pieces of semantic information need to be duplicated to form a meaningful
semantic representation? A case in point is English verb phrase ellipsis, a
construct where entire verb phrases can be abbreviated by a single auxiliary
verb. Are the otherwise known as powerful semantic parsers able to deal with
ellipsis or aren't they? We constructed a corpus of 120 cases of ellipsis with
their fully resolved meaning representation and used this as a challenge set
for a large battery of neural semantic parsers. Although these parsers
performed very well on the standard test set, they failed in the instances with
ellipsis. Data augmentation

### [6] [Comparison of Large Language Models for Deployment Requirements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00185)
*Alper Yaman,Jannik Schwab,Christof Nitsche,Abhirup Sinha,Marco Huber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文比较了大型语言模型（LLMs）的基础和领域特定模型，帮助研究者和公司根据许可和硬件需求选择最佳模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着开源LLM模型的增多，选择适合的模型变得复杂，因此需要系统化的比较工具。

Method: 通过整理和比较不同LLM的特征（如发布时间、许可和硬件需求），创建了一个持续更新的列表。

Result: 提供了一个公开的GitLab列表，方便用户快速选择和比较LLM模型。

Conclusion: 该工具简化了LLM选择过程，并将在未来持续更新以适应快速发展的LLM领域。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Generative Pre-trained Transformers
(GPTs) are revolutionizing the generation of human-like text, producing
contextually relevant and syntactically correct content. Despite challenges
like biases and hallucinations, these Artificial Intelligence (AI) models excel
in tasks, such as content creation, translation, and code generation.
Fine-tuning and novel architectures, such as Mixture of Experts (MoE), address
these issues. Over the past two years, numerous open-source foundational and
fine-tuned models have been introduced, complicating the selection of the
optimal LLM for researchers and companies regarding licensing and hardware
requirements. To navigate the rapidly evolving LLM landscape and facilitate LLM
selection, we present a comparative list of foundational and domain-specific
models, focusing on features, such as release year, licensing, and hardware
requirements. This list is published on GitLab and will be continuously
updated.

### [7] [Tabular Data Understanding with LLMs: A Survey of Recent Advances and Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00217)
*Xiaofeng Wu,Alan Ritter,Wei Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了表格在大型语言模型（LLMs）和多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）中的重要性，提出了表格输入表示的分类法和理解任务，并指出了当前研究中的关键问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格因其复杂和灵活的结构在LLMs和MLLMs中受到广泛关注，但缺乏通用方法，导致理解任务具有挑战性。

Method: 通过分类法介绍表格输入表示和表格理解任务，并分析现有研究的不足。

Result: 指出了三个关键研究空白：检索任务主导、复杂表格处理困难以及模型泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究以解决表格理解中的挑战，特别是在复杂结构、大规模表格和多表场景下的模型能力。

Abstract: Tables have gained significant attention in large language models (LLMs) and
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) due to their complex and flexible
structure. Unlike linear text inputs, tables are two-dimensional, encompassing
formats that range from well-structured database tables to complex,
multi-layered spreadsheets, each with different purposes. This diversity in
format and purpose has led to the development of specialized methods and tasks,
instead of universal approaches, making navigation of table understanding tasks
challenging. To address these challenges, this paper introduces key concepts
through a taxonomy of tabular input representations and an introduction of
table understanding tasks. We highlight several critical gaps in the field that
indicate the need for further research: (1) the predominance of
retrieval-focused tasks that require minimal reasoning beyond mathematical and
logical operations; (2) significant challenges faced by models when processing
complex table structures, large-scale tables, length context, or multi-table
scenarios; and (3) the limited generalization of models across different
tabular representations and formats.

### [8] [Semantic Compression for Word and Sentence Embeddings using Discrete Wavelet Transform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00220)
*Rana Aref Salama,Abdou Youssef,Mona Diab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了离散小波变换（DWT）在词和句子嵌入中的应用，展示了其在多分辨率分析和压缩嵌入表示中的能力，同时保持语义信息的完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小波变换在信号和图像处理中表现出色，但其在自然语言处理（NLP）中的应用潜力尚未充分挖掘。本文旨在探索DWT在分析、压缩嵌入表示中的有效性。

Method: 通过将DWT应用于词和句子嵌入，评估其在语义相似性任务中的表现，并测试不同嵌入模型（包括大语言模型）在下游任务中的效果。

Result: DWT能将嵌入维度减少50-93%，同时几乎不影响语义相似性任务的性能，并在多数下游任务中实现更高的准确率。

Conclusion: DWT为改进NLP应用提供了新途径，尤其在嵌入表示的高效压缩和语义信息保留方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Wavelet transforms, a powerful mathematical tool, have been widely used in
different domains, including Signal and Image processing, to unravel intricate
patterns, enhance data representation, and extract meaningful features from
data. Tangible results from their application suggest that Wavelet transforms
can be applied to NLP capturing a variety of linguistic and semantic
properties. In this paper, we empirically leverage the application of Discrete
Wavelet Transforms (DWT) to word and sentence embeddings. We aim to showcase
the capabilities of DWT in analyzing embedding representations at different
levels of resolution and compressing them while maintaining their overall
quality. We assess the effectiveness of DWT embeddings on semantic similarity
tasks to show how DWT can be used to consolidate important semantic information
in an embedding vector. We show the efficacy of the proposed paradigm using
different embedding models, including large language models, on downstream
tasks. Our results show that DWT can reduce the dimensionality of embeddings by
50-93% with almost no change in performance for semantic similarity tasks,
while achieving superior accuracy in most downstream tasks. Our findings pave
the way for applying DWT to improve NLP applications.

### [9] [Model Misalignment and Language Change: Traces of AI-Associated Language in Unscripted Spoken English](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00238)
*Bryce Anderson,Riley Galpin,Tom S. Juzek*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）对人类语言使用的影响，发现ChatGPT发布后，人类语言中与LLM相关的词汇使用显著增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs是否正在改变人类语言系统本身，而不仅仅是作为工具生成文本。

Method: 构建了一个包含2210万单词的非脚本口语数据集，分析ChatGPT发布前后与LLM相关词汇的使用趋势。

Result: 发现2022年后，与LLM相关的词汇使用显著增加，而基线同义词无明显变化。

Conclusion: 这可能标志着语言使用的显著转变，但尚不清楚是自然语言变化还是AI驱动的结果，同时引发了对模型对齐问题的伦理关注。

Abstract: In recent years, written language, particularly in science and education, has
undergone remarkable shifts in word usage. These changes are widely attributed
to the growing influence of Large Language Models (LLMs), which frequently rely
on a distinct lexical style. Divergences between model output and target
audience norms can be viewed as a form of misalignment. While these shifts are
often linked to using Artificial Intelligence (AI) directly as a tool to
generate text, it remains unclear whether the changes reflect broader changes
in the human language system itself. To explore this question, we constructed a
dataset of 22.1 million words from unscripted spoken language drawn from
conversational science and technology podcasts. We analyzed lexical trends
before and after ChatGPT's release in 2022, focusing on commonly LLM-associated
words. Our results show a moderate yet significant increase in the usage of
these words post-2022, suggesting a convergence between human word choices and
LLM-associated patterns. In contrast, baseline synonym words exhibit no
significant directional shift. Given the short time frame and the number of
words affected, this may indicate the onset of a remarkable shift in language
use. Whether this represents natural language change or a novel shift driven by
AI exposure remains an open question. Similarly, although the shifts may stem
from broader adoption patterns, it may also be that upstream training
misalignments ultimately contribute to changes in human language use. These
findings parallel ethical concerns that misaligned models may shape social and
moral beliefs.

### [10] [Integrating clinical reasoning into large language model-based diagnosis through etiology-aware attention steering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00285)
*Peixian Li,Yu Tian,Ruiqi Tu,Chengkai Wu,Jingjing Ren,Jingsong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种病因感知注意力引导框架，通过整合结构化临床推理提升LLM在复杂临床场景中的诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在医学文本理解和生成方面表现出色，但其在复杂临床诊断中的可靠性有限，因此需要提升其诊断准确性和临床推理能力。

Method: 研究构建了基于权威临床指南的临床推理支架（CRS），开发了病因感知头识别算法，并引入推理引导的参数高效微调方法。

Result: 在一致性诊断队列中，框架将平均诊断准确率提高了15.65%，推理聚焦分数提升了31.6%，外部验证也证实了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过将模型注意力与结构化CRS对齐，为构建更可解释和可靠的AI诊断系统提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Objective: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant capabilities
in medical text understanding and generation. However, their diagnostic
reliability in complex clinical scenarios remains limited. This study aims to
enhance LLMs' diagnostic accuracy and clinical reasoning ability. Method: We
propose an Etiology-Aware Attention Steering Framework to integrate structured
clinical reasoning into LLM-based diagnosis. Specifically, we first construct
Clinical Reasoning Scaffolding (CRS) based on authoritative clinical guidelines
for three representative acute abdominal emergencies: acute appendicitis, acute
pancreatitis, and acute cholecystitis. Next, we develop the Etiology-Aware Head
Identification algorithm to pinpoint attention heads crucial for the model's
etiology reasoning. To ensure reliable clinical reasoning alignment, we
introduce the Reasoning-Guided Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning that embeds
etiological reasoning cues into input representations and steers the selected
Etiology-Aware Heads toward critical information through a Reasoning-Guided
Loss function. Result: On the Consistent Diagnosis Cohort, our framework
improves average diagnostic accuracy by 15.65% and boosts the average Reasoning
Focus Score by 31.6% over baselines. External validation on the Discrepant
Diagnosis Cohort further confirms its effectiveness in enhancing diagnostic
accuracy. Further assessments via Reasoning Attention Frequency indicate that
our models exhibit enhanced reliability when faced with real-world complex
scenarios. Conclusion: This study presents a practical and effective approach
to enhance clinical reasoning in LLM-based diagnosis. By aligning model
attention with structured CRS, the proposed framework offers a promising
paradigm for building more interpretable and reliable AI diagnostic systems in
complex clinical settings.

### [11] [Systematic Evaluation of Optimization Techniques for Long-Context Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00305)
*Ammar Ahmed,Sheng Di,Franck Cappello,Zirui Liu,Jingoo Han,Ali Anwar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文系统评估了大型语言模型（LLM）的优化技术（如剪枝、量化和令牌丢弃）在长上下文场景中的效果，揭示了组合优化对更大模型的负面影响，并强调了系统级分析与任务特定指标结合的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在多种自然语言处理任务中表现出色，但其资源需求和有限上下文窗口问题仍未充分解决，尤其是在长上下文场景中。

Method: 研究首先分析两种支持长上下文的LLM架构的单独优化方法，随后系统评估这些技术的组合效果，并在70B参数模型上验证其扩展性。

Result: 研究发现，组合优化算法可能对更大模型产生负面影响（因近似误差累积），且仅依赖F1分数会掩盖问答任务中的精度-召回权衡。

Conclusion: 通过系统级分析与任务特定指标的结合，研究为LLM实践者和研究者提供了平衡效率、准确性和扩展性的指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel across diverse natural language processing
tasks but face resource demands and limited context windows. Although
techniques like pruning, quantization, and token dropping can mitigate these
issues, their efficacy in long-context scenarios and system evaluation remains
underexplored. This paper systematically benchmarks these optimizations,
characterizing memory usage, latency, and throughput, and studies how these
methods impact the quality of text generation. We first analyze individual
optimization methods for two LLM architectures supporting long context and then
systematically evaluate combinations of these techniques to assess how this
deeper analysis impacts performance metrics. We subsequently study the
scalability of individual optimization methods on a larger variant with 70
billion-parameter model. Our novel insights reveal that naive combination
inference optimization algorithms can adversely affect larger models due to
compounded approximation errors, as compared to their smaller counterparts.
Experiments show that relying solely on F1 obscures these effects by hiding
precision-recall trade-offs in question answering tasks. By integrating
system-level profiling with task-specific insights, this study helps LLM
practitioners and researchers explore and balance efficiency, accuracy, and
scalability across tasks and hardware configurations.

### [12] [Improving Multimodal Contrastive Learning of Sentence Embeddings with Object-Phrase Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00332)
*Kaiyan Zhao,Zhongtao Miao,Yoshimasa Tsuruoka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MCSEO提出了一种通过细粒度对象-短语对齐增强多模态句子嵌入的方法，优于传统图像-标题对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态句子嵌入模型通常利用图像-标题对进行训练，但这些对可能包含冗余或无关信息，影响模型性能。

Method: MCSEO利用分割和对象检测模型提取准确的对象-短语对，优化针对对象-短语对应的对比学习目标。

Result: 在语义文本相似性（STS）任务中，MCSEO在不同骨干模型上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 精确的对象-短语对齐对多模态表示学习具有重要意义。

Abstract: Multimodal sentence embedding models typically leverage image-caption pairs
in addition to textual data during training. However, such pairs often contain
noise, including redundant or irrelevant information on either the image or
caption side. To mitigate this issue, we propose MCSEO, a method that enhances
multimodal sentence embeddings by incorporating fine-grained object-phrase
alignment alongside traditional image-caption alignment. Specifically, MCSEO
utilizes existing segmentation and object detection models to extract accurate
object-phrase pairs, which are then used to optimize a contrastive learning
objective tailored to object-phrase correspondence. Experimental results on
semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks across different backbone models
demonstrate that MCSEO consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting
the significance of precise object-phrase alignment in multimodal
representation learning.

### [13] [PilotRL: Training Language Model Agents via Global Planning-Guided Progressive Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00344)
*Keer Lu,Chong Chen,Bin Cui,Huang Leng,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AdaPlan的自适应全局规划代理范式，结合高层次显式指导与执行，以支持有效的长期决策。进一步提出了PilotRL框架，通过渐进式强化学习优化LLM代理的全局规划和执行协调能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在代理任务中面临单步推理与即时执行的局限性，缺乏长期战略规划能力，且监督微调导致泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出AdaPlan范式，结合显式全局规划与执行；开发PilotRL框架，通过渐进式强化学习分阶段优化规划和执行协调。

Result: 实验显示，PilotRL在LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct上表现优异，超越GPT-4o 3.60%，对比GPT-4o-mini提升55.78%。

Conclusion: AdaPlan和PilotRL显著提升了LLM代理在复杂任务中的长期规划和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in tackling
agent-oriented tasks. Despite their potential, existing work faces challenges
when deploying LLMs in agent-based environments. The widely adopted agent
paradigm ReAct centers on integrating single-step reasoning with immediate
action execution, which limits its effectiveness in complex tasks requiring
long-term strategic planning. Furthermore, the coordination between the planner
and executor during problem-solving is also a critical factor to consider in
agent design. Additionally, current approaches predominantly rely on supervised
fine-tuning, which often leads models to memorize established task completion
trajectories, thereby restricting their generalization ability when confronted
with novel problem contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce an
adaptive global plan-based agent paradigm AdaPlan, aiming to synergize
high-level explicit guidance with execution to support effective long-horizon
decision-making. Based on the proposed paradigm, we further put forward
PilotRL, a global planning-guided training framework for LLM agents driven by
progressive reinforcement learning. We first develop the model's ability to
follow explicit guidance from global plans when addressing agent tasks.
Subsequently, based on this foundation, we focus on optimizing the quality of
generated plans. Finally, we conduct joint optimization of the model's planning
and execution coordination. Experiments indicate that PilotRL could achieve
state-of-the-art performances, with LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + PilotRL surpassing
closed-sourced GPT-4o by 3.60%, while showing a more substantial gain of 55.78%
comparing to GPT-4o-mini at a comparable parameter scale.

### [14] [Lucy: edgerunning agentic web search on mobile with machine generated task vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00360)
*Alan Dao,Dinh Bach Vu,Alex Nguyen,Norapat Buppodom*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 小语言模型（SLMs）在知识密集型任务中表现受限，但通过动态任务向量机（动态推理机制）和强化学习优化，Lucy（1.7B参数）在SimpleQA基准测试中达到78.3%准确率，媲美更大模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SLMs因容量限制在知识密集型任务中的性能不足问题，探索动态推理机制以提升表现。

Method: 提出动态任务向量机，将模型内部推理（<think>和</think>标签内内容）视为动态任务向量，通过RLVR优化，并集成MCP。

Result: Lucy（1.7B参数）在SimpleQA基准测试中达到78.3%准确率，与更大模型（如DeepSeek-V3）表现相当。

Conclusion: 小模型通过结构化、自构建的任务推理机制，可以媲美大模型性能。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are inherently limited in knowledge-intensive
tasks due to their constrained capacity. While test-time computation offers a
path to enhanced performance, most approaches treat reasoning as a fixed or
heuristic process. In this work, we propose a new paradigm: viewing the model's
internal reasoning, delimited by <think> and </think> tags, as a dynamic task
vector machine. Rather than treating the content inside these tags as a mere
trace of thought, we interpret the generation process itself as a mechanism
through which the model \textbf{constructs and refines its own task vectors} on
the fly. We developed a method to optimize this dynamic task vector machine
through RLVR and successfully trained an agentic web-search model. We present
Lucy, a 1.7B-parameter SLM that leverages this dynamic reasoning mechanism with
MCP integration to achieve 78.3% accuracy on the SimpleQA benchmark, performing
on par with much larger models such as DeepSeek-V3. This demonstrates that
small models can rival large ones when equipped with structured,
self-constructed task reasoning.

### [15] [EdgeInfinite-Instruct: Bridging SFT-Based Optimization and NPU-Level Efficiency for Edge Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00370)
*Jiyu Chen,Poh Seng Lim,Shuang Peng,Daxiong Luo,JungHau Foo,Yap Deep,Timothy Lee Jun Jie,Kelvin Teh Kae Wen,Fan Yang,Danyu Feng,Hao-Yun Chen,Peng-Wen Chen,Fangyuan Li,Xiaoxin Chen,Wong Wai Mun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EdgeInfinite-Instruct通过分段监督微调和量化优化，解决了Transformer模型在边缘设备上部署时的计算和内存问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限的边缘设备上部署大型语言模型时，自注意力机制的高计算复杂性和KV缓存需求是主要挑战。

Method: 提出Segmented Supervised Fine-Tuning (S-SFT)策略，结合细粒度量化技术和固定形状计算图优化。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在长上下文任务和移动设备上保持了高效性和性能。

Conclusion: EdgeInfinite-Instruct为边缘设备上的长序列任务提供了高效且性能良好的解决方案。

Abstract: Deploying Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) on
resource-constrained edge devices for long-sequence tasks remains challenging
due to the quadratic time complexity of self-attention and growing Key-Value
(KV) cache demands. While existing KV cache optimizations improve memory
efficiency, they often fail to reduce time to first token (TTFT) and may
degrade performance through token pruning. Alternative sequence modeling
architectures address some of these limitations, but typically require full
retraining and lack infrastructure support. EdgeInfinite offers an efficient
solution by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters, maintaining quality
while reducing both computational and memory costs, including improved TTFT.
However, its instruction-following ability is limited, and it lacks
mobile-specific optimizations. To address these issues, we propose
EdgeInfinite-Instruct, which introduces a Segmented Supervised Fine-Tuning
(S-SFT) strategy tailored to long-sequence tasks such as summarization and
question answering. We further optimized EdgeInfinite-Instruct for efficient
deployment on edge NPUs by employing fine-grained post-training quantization
(PTQ) to reduce computational demands while maintaining accuracy, and by
implementing a fixed-shape computation graph that balances memory usage and
on-device efficiency through scenario-specific customization of input token and
cache sizes. Experiments on long-context benchmarks and real-world mobile tasks
show that our approach improves domain-specific performance while maintaining
efficiency on NPU-accelerated edge devices.

TL;DR: 本文研究了上下文学习（ICL）中演示无效的原因，提出了一种基于梯度流的新方法GradS来选择有效演示，实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究假设ICL中的演示总是有效，但实际并非如此。本文旨在探究演示无效的原因，并提出改进方法。

Method: 通过梯度流和线性自注意力模型分析演示无效性，提出GradS方法，利用梯度流幅度选择演示。

Result: 实验表明，模型层数增加会放大演示有效性差异，GradS在五个数据集上平均相对提升6.8%。

Conclusion: GradS通过梯度流选择演示，显著提升了ICL的性能，验证了演示无效性的理论分析。

Abstract: Numerous studies have investigated the underlying mechanisms of in-context
learning (ICL) effectiveness to inspire the design of related methods. However,
existing work predominantly assumes the effectiveness of the demonstrations
provided within ICL, while many research indicates that not all demonstrations
are effective, failing to yielding any performance improvement during ICL.
Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the reasons behind demonstration
ineffectiveness. Our analysis is based on gradient flow and linear
self-attention models. By setting the gradient flow to zero, we deduce that a
demonstration becomes ineffective if its information has either been learned by
the model or is irrelevant to the user query. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
in multi-layer models, the disparity in effectiveness among demonstrations is
amplified with layer increasing, causing the model to focus more on effective
ones. Considering that current demonstration selection methods primarily focus
on the relevance to the user query while overlooking the information that the
model has already assimilated, we propose a novel method called GradS, which
leverages gradient flow for demonstration selection. We use the magnitude of
the gradient flow of the demonstration with respect to a given user query as
the criterion, thereby ensuring the effectiveness of the chosen ones. We
validate our derivation and GradS on four prominent LLMs across five mainstream
datasets. The experimental results confirm that the disparity in effectiveness
among demonstrations is magnified as the model layer increases, substantiating
our derivations. Moreover, GradS achieves a relative improvement of $6.8\%$ on
average over the strongest baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SA-GCS的新训练框架，通过结合课程学习与强化学习，解决了现有方法在数据利用效率、收敛速度和样本难度差异上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机视觉语言导航任务中，现有强化学习方法存在训练数据利用效率低、收敛慢及样本难度差异考虑不足的问题，限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出SA-GCS框架，包括语义感知难度估计器（SA-DE）和高斯课程调度器（GCS），动态调整样本分布，实现从易到难的渐进训练。

Result: 在CityNav基准测试中，SA-GCS在所有指标上均优于基线方法，收敛更快且更稳定，且在不同规模模型上泛化良好。

Conclusion: SA-GCS框架显著提升了训练效率和模型性能，具有鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) aims to enable
agents to accurately localize targets and plan flight paths in complex
environments based on natural language instructions, with broad applications in
intelligent inspection, disaster rescue, and urban monitoring. Recent progress
in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has provided strong semantic understanding for
this task, while reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising
post-training strategy to further improve generalization. However, existing RL
methods often suffer from inefficient use of training data, slow convergence,
and insufficient consideration of the difficulty variation among training
samples, which limits further performance improvement. To address these
challenges, we propose \textbf{Semantic-Aware Gaussian Curriculum Scheduling
(SA-GCS)}, a novel training framework that systematically integrates Curriculum
Learning (CL) into RL. SA-GCS employs a Semantic-Aware Difficulty Estimator
(SA-DE) to quantify the complexity of training samples and a Gaussian
Curriculum Scheduler (GCS) to dynamically adjust the sampling distribution,
enabling a smooth progression from easy to challenging tasks. This design
significantly improves training efficiency, accelerates convergence, and
enhances overall model performance. Extensive experiments on the CityNav
benchmark demonstrate that SA-GCS consistently outperforms strong baselines
across all metrics, achieves faster and more stable convergence, and
generalizes well across models of different scales, highlighting its robustness
and scalability. The implementation of our approach is publicly available.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了将离散小波变换（DWT）应用于词和句子嵌入，提出了一种非参数化模型，结合DWT与离散余弦变换（DCT）压缩句子信息，并在下游任务中表现优异。


<details>

Motivation: 小波技术在图像和信号处理中表现出色，作者希望将其应用于自然语言处理（NLP）任务，以捕捉多种语言特性。

Method: 应用DWT评估词向量的信息压缩和降维效果，并结合DCT提出非参数化模型，压缩句子信息为固定大小的向量。

Result: 提出的方法在下游任务中表现优异，部分任务甚至优于原始嵌入。

Conclusion: 小波变换在NLP中具有潜力，尤其是在信息压缩和降维方面。

Abstract: Wavelets have emerged as a cutting edge technology in a number of fields.
Concrete results of their application in Image and Signal processing suggest
that wavelets can be effectively applied to Natural Language Processing (NLP)
tasks that capture a variety of linguistic properties. In this paper, we
leverage the power of applying Discrete Wavelet Transforms (DWT) to word and
sentence embeddings. We first evaluate, intrinsically and extrinsically, how
wavelets can effectively be used to consolidate important information in a word
vector while reducing its dimensionality. We further combine DWT with Discrete
Cosine Transform (DCT) to propose a non-parameterized model that compresses a
sentence with a dense amount of information in a fixed size vector based on
locally varying word features. We show the efficacy of the proposed paradigm on
downstream applications models yielding comparable and even superior (in some
tasks) results to original embeddings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReaGAN提出了一种基于代理的框架，通过节点级自主决策和检索增强生成，解决了传统GNN在节点信息不平衡和全局语义关系捕捉上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN的固定聚合机制无法处理节点信息不平衡和全局语义关系，限制了模型性能。

Method: ReaGAN框架中，每个节点作为代理自主决策，结合内部记忆和检索增强生成（RAG）技术，实现自适应消息传播和全局关系构建。

Result: ReaGAN在少样本情境下表现优异，无需微调即可利用冻结的LLM骨干网络。

Conclusion: ReaGAN展示了代理规划和局部-全局检索在图学习中的潜力。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in graph-based
learning by propagating information among neighbor nodes via predefined
aggregation mechanisms. However, such fixed schemes often suffer from two key
limitations. First, they cannot handle the imbalance in node informativeness --
some nodes are rich in information, while others remain sparse. Second,
predefined message passing primarily leverages local structural similarity
while ignoring global semantic relationships across the graph, limiting the
model's ability to capture distant but relevant information. We propose
Retrieval-augmented Graph Agentic Network (ReaGAN), an agent-based framework
that empowers each node with autonomous, node-level decision-making. Each node
acts as an agent that independently plans its next action based on its internal
memory, enabling node-level planning and adaptive message propagation.
Additionally, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows nodes to access
semantically relevant content and build global relationships in the graph.
ReaGAN achieves competitive performance under few-shot in-context settings
using a frozen LLM backbone without fine-tuning, showcasing the potential of
agentic planning and local-global retrieval in graph learning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的多轮对话评估方法，通过将多个LLM法官的偏好知识聚合到一个模型中，减少计算开销并保持评估质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的对话评估方法存在偏见和计算成本高的问题，需要一种更高效可靠的解决方案。

Method: 提出一种多轮对话评估器，聚合多个LLM法官的偏好知识到单一模型中，降低评估成本。

Result: 在七个对话评估基准测试中表现优于现有基线，展示了高效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持评估质量的同时显著降低了计算成本，适用于多样化场景。

Abstract: Evaluating the conversational abilities of large language models (LLMs)
remains a challenging task. Current mainstream approaches primarily rely on the
``LLM-as-a-judge" paradigm, where an LLM is prompted to serve as an evaluator
to assess dialogue quality. However, such methods often suffer from various
biases, which undermine the reliability and consistency of the evaluation
results. To mitigate these biases, recent methods employ multiple LLMs as
judges and aggregate their judgments to select the optimal assessment. Although
effective, this multi-judge approach incurs significant computational overhead
during inference. In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-turn dialogue
evaluator that captures the collective wisdom of multiple LLM judges by
aggregating their preference knowledge into a single model. Our approach
preserves the advantages of diverse multi-judge feedback while drastically
reducing the evaluation cost, enabling fast and flexible dialogue quality
assessment. Extensive experiments on seven single rating and pairwise
comparison dialogue evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that our method
outperforms existing baselines across diverse scenarios, showcasing its
efficiency and robustness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种检测半真半假言论的任务，并开发了TRACER框架，通过分析证据对齐、推断隐含意图和评估隐藏内容的影响来识别基于遗漏的虚假信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事实核查系统无法处理半真半假言论（事实正确但误导性），因为它们未考虑遗漏的关键上下文。

Method: 提出了PolitiFact-Hidden基准数据集和TRACER框架，通过证据对齐、意图推断和隐藏内容因果分析来检测遗漏性虚假信息。

Result: TRACER显著提升了半真半假分类的F1分数（最高提升16分），并可与现有事实核查系统集成。

Conclusion: 建模遗漏内容对于可信的事实核查至关重要，TRACER为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Fact verification systems typically assess whether a claim is supported by
retrieved evidence, assuming that truthfulness depends solely on what is
stated. However, many real-world claims are half-truths, factually correct yet
misleading due to the omission of critical context. Existing models struggle
with such cases, as they are not designed to reason about what is left unsaid.
We introduce the task of half-truth detection, and propose PolitiFact-Hidden, a
new benchmark with 15k political claims annotated with sentence-level evidence
alignment and inferred claim intent. To address this challenge, we present
TRACER, a modular re-assessment framework that identifies omission-based
misinformation by aligning evidence, inferring implied intent, and estimating
the causal impact of hidden content. TRACER can be integrated into existing
fact-checking pipelines and consistently improves performance across multiple
strong baselines. Notably, it boosts Half-True classification F1 by up to 16
points, highlighting the importance of modeling omissions for trustworthy fact
verification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LoRA的表达能力与泛化能力之间的关系，并解决现有方法未充分研究LoRA的锐度与泛化关联的问题。

Method: 提出Flat-LoRA和EFlat-LoRA，通过理论证明全参数空间的扰动可转移到低秩子空间，避免多矩阵干扰。

Result: EFlat-LoRA在GLUE和视觉语言模型上表现优于LoRA和全微调，提升1.0%和0.5%等。

Conclusion: LoRA的泛化与锐度密切相关，Flat-LoRA和EFlat-LoRA有效提升性能。

Abstract: Little research explores the correlation between the expressive ability and
generalization ability of the low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Sharpness-Aware
Minimization (SAM) improves model generalization for both Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformers by encouraging convergence to locally flat
minima. However, the connection between sharpness and generalization has not
been fully explored for LoRA due to the lack of tools to either empirically
seek flat minima or develop theoretical methods. In this work, we propose
Flat-LoRA and its efficient version i.e., EFlat-LoRA, to seek flat minima for
LoRA. Concretely, we theoretically demonstrate that perturbations in the full
parameter space can be transferred to the low-rank subspace. This approach
eliminates the potential interference introduced by perturbations across
multiple matrices in the low-rank subspace. Our extensive experiments on large
language models and vision-language models demonstrate that EFlat-LoRA achieves
optimize efficiency comparable to that of LoRA while simultaneously attaining
comparable or even better performance. For example, on the GLUE dataset with
RoBERTa-large, EFlat-LoRA outperforms LoRA and full fine-tuning by 1.0% and
0.5% on average, respectively. On vision-language models e.g., Qwen-VL-Chat
shows performance improvements of 1.5% and 1.0% on SQA and VizWiz datasets,
respectively. These empirical results also verify that the generalization of
LoRA is closely related to sharpness, which is omitted by previous methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了表情符号如何影响语音中的韵律实现以及听者如何通过韵律线索理解表情符号的含义，通过实证数据揭示了表情符号在口语中的交际作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在文本交流中，缺乏韵律特征（如音高、节奏和语调）时，表情符号作为视觉替代品传递情感和语用信息。研究旨在揭示表情符号如何影响口语中的韵律表达及其理解。

Method: 通过结构化但开放式的生产和感知任务收集真实的人类语音数据，直接分析韵律与表情符号之间的联系。

Result: 说话者会根据表情符号调整韵律，听者通常能仅通过韵律变化识别表情符号，且表情符号语义差异越大，韵律差异越明显。

Conclusion: 表情符号可以作为韵律意图的有意义载体，揭示了其在数字媒介中的交际作用。

Abstract: Prosodic features such as pitch, timing, and intonation are central to spoken
communication, conveying emotion, intent, and discourse structure. In
text-based settings, where these cues are absent, emojis act as visual
surrogates that add affective and pragmatic nuance. This study examines how
emojis influence prosodic realisation in speech and how listeners interpret
prosodic cues to recover emoji meanings. Unlike previous work, we directly link
prosody and emoji by analysing actual human speech data, collected through
structured but open-ended production and perception tasks. This provides
empirical evidence of how emoji semantics shape spoken delivery and perception.
Results show that speakers adapt their prosody based on emoji cues, listeners
can often identify the intended emoji from prosodic variation alone, and
greater semantic differences between emojis correspond to increased prosodic
divergence. These findings suggest that emojis can act as meaningful carriers
of prosodic intent, offering insight into their communicative role in digitally
mediated contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大型语言模型训练计算和时间成本高，小型模型也需多GPU和数天时间。本文旨在探索快速训练和评估方法。

Method: 引入PaPaformer架构，通过并行路径训练不同数据，再组合为更大模型，减少参数和训练时间。

Result: 降低总参数量和训练时间，同时提高性能，并行路径结构支持任务定制。

Conclusion: PaPaformer为高效训练语言模型提供了新思路，具有任务定制潜力。

Abstract: The training of modern large-language models requires an increasingly amount
of computation power and time. Even smaller variants, such as small-language
models (SLMs), take several days to train in the best-case scenarios, often
requiring multiple GPUs. This paper explores methods to train and evaluate
decoder-only transformer-based language models in hours instead of days/weeks.
We introduces \textit{PaPaformer}, a decoder-only transformer architecture
variant, whose lower-dimensional parallel paths are combined into larger model.
The paper shows that these lower-dimensional paths can be trained individually
with different types of training data and then combined into one larger model.
This method gives the option to reduce the total number of model parameters and
the training time with increasing performance. Moreover, the use of parallel
path structure opens interesting possibilities to customize paths to
accommodate specific task requirements.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SynAdapt的高效推理框架，通过生成合成的连续CoT（CCoT）作为对齐目标，并结合难度分类器优化LLM性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有连续CoT（CCoT）方法存在间接微调、对齐不足或目标不一致的问题，影响了推理效率。

Method: SynAdapt生成合成CCoT作为对齐目标，并引入难度分类器识别难题，自适应地提示LLM重新思考难题。

Result: 实验结果表明，SynAdapt在多种难度基准测试中实现了最佳的准确性与效率平衡。

Conclusion: SynAdapt通过合成CCoT和自适应提示机制，显著提升了推理效率和准确性。

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves model performance, it incurs
significant time costs due to the generation of discrete CoT tokens (DCoT).
Continuous CoT (CCoT) offers a more efficient alternative, but existing CCoT
methods are hampered by indirect fine-tuning, limited alignment, or
inconsistent targets. To overcome these limitations, we propose
\textit{SynAdapt}, an innovative efficient reasoning framework. Specifically,
\textit{SynAdapt} generates the synthetic CCoT to serve as a precise and
effective alignment target for LLMs. This synthetic CCoT explicitly guides the
LLM to learn CCoT and derive accurate answers directly. Furthermore, relying
solely on CCoT is insufficient for solving hard questions. To address this,
\textit{SynAdapt} integrates a difficulty classifier that leverages both
question context and CCoT to identify hard questions. CCoT can effectively help
identify hard questions after some brief reasoning. We then adaptively prompt
the LLM to re-think these hard questions for improved performance. Extensive
experimental results across various benchmarks from different difficulty levels
strongly demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving the best
accuracy-efficiency trade-off.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM置信度估计方法忽略响应与上下文的相关性，影响输出质量评估。

Method: 提出CRUX框架，结合上下文熵减和一致性检查两种新指标。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现最佳，AUROC最高。

Conclusion: CRUX有效提升LLM置信度估计的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate confidence estimation is essential for trustworthy large language
models (LLMs) systems, as it empowers the user to determine when to trust
outputs and enables reliable deployment in safety-critical applications.
Current confidence estimation methods for LLMs neglect the relevance between
responses and contextual information, a crucial factor in output quality
evaluation, particularly in scenarios where background knowledge is provided.
To bridge this gap, we propose CRUX (Context-aware entropy Reduction and
Unified consistency eXamination), the first framework that integrates context
faithfulness and consistency for confidence estimation via two novel metrics.
First, contextual entropy reduction represents data uncertainty with the
information gain through contrastive sampling with and without context. Second,
unified consistency examination captures potential model uncertainty through
the global consistency of the generated answers with and without context.
Experiments across three benchmark datasets (CoQA, SQuAD, QuAC) and two
domain-specific datasets (BioASQ, EduQG) demonstrate CRUX's effectiveness,
achieving the highest AUROC than existing baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图卷积网络（GCN）的新型主题模型GHTM，用于解决孟加拉语主题建模的挑战，并在实验中优于其他方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉语因其形态复杂性和资源匮乏，主题建模研究较少，需要更有效的模型。

Method: 使用GCN生成文档的语义嵌入，并通过非负矩阵分解（NMF）提取主题表示。

Result: GHTM在主题一致性和多样性上优于传统和现代方法。

Conclusion: GHTM为孟加拉语主题建模提供了有效解决方案，并引入了新的数据集NCTBText。

Abstract: Topic modeling is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique that is used
to identify latent themes and extract topics from text corpora by grouping
similar documents based on their most significant keywords. Although widely
researched in English, topic modeling remains understudied in Bengali due to
its morphological complexity, lack of adequate resources and initiatives. In
this contribution, a novel Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based model called
GHTM (Graph-Based Hybrid Topic Model) is proposed. This model represents input
vectors of documents as nodes in the graph, which GCN uses to produce
semantically rich embeddings. The embeddings are then decomposed using
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to get the topical representations of
the underlying themes of the text corpus. This study compares the proposed
model against a wide range of Bengali topic modeling techniques, from
traditional methods such as LDA, LSA, and NMF to contemporary frameworks such
as BERTopic and Top2Vec on three Bengali datasets. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model by outperforming other
models in topic coherence and diversity. In addition, we introduce a novel
Bengali dataset called "NCTBText" sourced from Bengali textbook materials to
enrich and diversify the predominantly newspaper-centric Bengali corpora.

Result: 威胁或小费无显著影响，但提示变化对单个问题有显著影响。

Conclusion: 简单提示变化可能不如预期有效，但对个别问题可能有显著效果。

Abstract: This is the third in a series of short reports that seek to help business,
education, and policy leaders understand the technical details of working with
AI through rigorous testing. In this report, we investigate two commonly held
prompting beliefs: a) offering to tip the AI model and b) threatening the AI
model. Tipping was a commonly shared tactic for improving AI performance and
threats have been endorsed by Google Founder Sergey Brin (All-In, May 2025,
8:20) who observed that 'models tend to do better if you threaten them,' a
claim we subject to empirical testing here. We evaluate model performance on
GPQA (Rein et al. 2024) and MMLU-Pro (Wang et al. 2024).
  We demonstrate two things:
  - Threatening or tipping a model generally has no significant effect on
benchmark performance.
  - Prompt variations can significantly affect performance on a per-question
level. However, it is hard to know in advance whether a particular prompting
approach will help or harm the LLM's ability to answer any particular question.
  Taken together, this suggests that simple prompting variations might not be
as effective as previously assumed, especially for difficult problems. However,
as reported previously (Meincke et al. 2025a), prompting approaches can yield
significantly different results for individual questions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AIG文本检测器在内部测试中表现良好，但在实际应用中不够鲁棒，尤其是对少样本和领域特定文本的检测能力不足。

Method: 构建DACTYL数据集，包含少样本和领域特定文本，并采用BCE和DXO两种优化方法训练分类器。

Result: DXO分类器在分布外文本上表现优于BCE分类器，尤其在学生论文检测场景中显著提升性能。

Conclusion: DXO优化方法能更好地泛化，避免过拟合，为AIG文本检测器的改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Existing AIG (AI-generated) text detectors struggle in real-world settings
despite succeeding in internal testing, suggesting that they may not be robust
enough. We rigorously examine the machine-learning procedure to build these
detectors to address this. Most current AIG text detection datasets focus on
zero-shot generations, but little work has been done on few-shot or one-shot
generations, where LLMs are given human texts as an example. In response, we
introduce the Diverse Adversarial Corpus of Texts Yielded from Language models
(DACTYL), a challenging AIG text detection dataset focusing on
one-shot/few-shot generations. We also include texts from domain-specific
continued-pre-trained (CPT) language models, where we fully train all
parameters using a memory-efficient optimization approach. Many existing AIG
text detectors struggle significantly on our dataset, indicating a potential
vulnerability to one-shot/few-shot and CPT-generated texts. We also train our
own classifiers using two approaches: standard binary cross-entropy (BCE)
optimization and a more recent approach, deep X-risk optimization (DXO). While
BCE-trained classifiers marginally outperform DXO classifiers on the DACTYL
test set, the latter excels on out-of-distribution (OOD) texts. In our mock
deployment scenario in student essay detection with an OOD student essay
dataset, the best DXO classifier outscored the best BCE-trained classifier by
50.56 macro-F1 score points at the lowest false positive rates for both. Our
results indicate that DXO classifiers generalize better without overfitting to
the test set. Our experiments highlight several areas of improvement for AIG
text detectors.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in medicine has enabled
impressive capabilities, yet a critical gap remains in their ability to perform
systematic, transparent, and verifiable reasoning, a cornerstone of clinical
practice. This has catalyzed a shift from single-step answer generation to the
development of LLMs explicitly designed for medical reasoning. This paper
provides the first systematic review of this emerging field. We propose a
taxonomy of reasoning enhancement techniques, categorized into training-time
strategies (e.g., supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning) and test-time
mechanisms (e.g., prompt engineering, multi-agent systems). We analyze how
these techniques are applied across different data modalities (text, image,
code) and in key clinical applications such as diagnosis, education, and
treatment planning. Furthermore, we survey the evolution of evaluation
benchmarks from simple accuracy metrics to sophisticated assessments of
reasoning quality and visual interpretability. Based on an analysis of 60
seminal studies from 2022-2025, we conclude by identifying critical challenges,
including the faithfulness-plausibility gap and the need for native multimodal
reasoning, and outlining future directions toward building efficient, robust,
and sociotechnically responsible medical AI.

Motivation: 由于大多数LLMs主要基于欧美文化数据训练，缺乏对其他语言和文化的适应性，特别是在波斯语和伊朗文化方面存在显著评估空白。

Method: 研究设计了19个新数据集，涵盖伊朗法律、波斯语法、波斯习语和大学入学考试等主题，用于评估LLMs。

Result: 通过对41个主流LLMs的基准测试，填补了该领域在文化和语言评估方面的空白。

Conclusion: 研究为LLMs在非英语和非西方文化中的评估提供了重要资源，强调了多语言和文化多样性评估的必要性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in our daily
lives, evaluating their quality and reliability across diverse contexts has
become essential. While comprehensive benchmarks exist for assessing LLM
performance in English, there remains a significant gap in evaluation resources
for other languages. Moreover, because most LLMs are trained primarily on data
rooted in European and American cultures, they often lack familiarity with
non-Western cultural contexts. To address this limitation, our study focuses on
the Persian language and Iranian culture. We introduce 19 new evaluation
datasets specifically designed to assess LLMs on topics such as Iranian law,
Persian grammar, Persian idioms, and university entrance exams. Using these
datasets, we benchmarked 41 prominent LLMs, aiming to bridge the existing
cultural and linguistic evaluation gap in the field.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于预训练语言模型和双向LSTM的序列句子对分类器（SSPC），用于检测文档中的风格变化，并在PAN 2025任务中取得了优于基准模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 风格变化检测是计算作者分析中最重要且具挑战性的问题之一，尤其是在句子级别的细粒度检测。

Method: 使用预训练语言模型（PLM）生成句子表示，通过双向LSTM（BiLSTM）进行上下文建模，再通过多层感知机（MLP）预测相邻句子的风格变化。

Result: 模型在PAN-2025测试数据集上的宏F1分数分别为0.923（EASY）、0.828（MEDIUM）和0.724（HARD），优于随机基准和零样本模型。

Conclusion: SSPC方法在风格变化检测任务中表现优异，尤其是在处理短句和风格浅显的文本时具有优势。

Abstract: Style change detection - identifying the points in a document where writing
style shifts - remains one of the most important and challenging problems in
computational authorship analysis. At PAN 2025, the shared task challenges
participants to detect style switches at the most fine-grained level:
individual sentences. The task spans three datasets, each designed with
controlled and increasing thematic variety within documents. We propose to
address this problem by modeling the content of each problem instance - that
is, a series of sentences - as a whole, using a Sequential Sentence Pair
Classifier (SSPC). The architecture leverages a pre-trained language model
(PLM) to obtain representations of individual sentences, which are then fed
into a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) to contextualize them within the document.
The BiLSTM-produced vectors of adjacent sentences are concatenated and passed
to a multi-layer perceptron for prediction per adjacency. Building on the work
of previous PAN participants classical text segmentation, the approach is
relatively conservative and lightweight. Nevertheless, it proves effective in
leveraging contextual information and addressing what is arguably the most
challenging aspect of this year's shared task: the notorious problem of
"stylistically shallow", short sentences that are prevalent in the proposed
benchmark data. Evaluated on the official PAN-2025 test datasets, the model
achieves strong macro-F1 scores of 0.923, 0.828, and 0.724 on the EASY, MEDIUM,
and HARD data, respectively, outperforming not only the official random
baselines but also a much more challenging one: claude-3.7-sonnet's zero-shot
performance.

Motivation: 法律先例检索在普通法体系中至关重要，但传统方法难以应对日益增长的法律文档复杂性和数量。

Method: 系统整合了BM25、向量数据库和交叉编码器模型，采用层次化BiLSTM CRF分类器生成修辞标注，并通过互惠排名融合进行结果重排。

Result: 在IL-PCR和COLIEE 2025数据集上的评估表明，TraceRetriever能有效应对文档增长挑战，且适用于部分案例知识的检索。

Conclusion: TraceRetriever为法律研究提供了可靠且可扩展的先例检索基础，尤其适用于信息不完整的情况。

Abstract: Legal precedent retrieval is a cornerstone of the common law system, governed
by the principle of stare decisis, which demands consistency in judicial
decisions. However, the growing complexity and volume of legal documents
challenge traditional retrieval methods. TraceRetriever mirrors real-world
legal search by operating with limited case information, extracting only
rhetorically significant segments instead of requiring complete documents. Our
pipeline integrates BM25, Vector Database, and Cross-Encoder models, combining
initial results through Reciprocal Rank Fusion before final re-ranking.
Rhetorical annotations are generated using a Hierarchical BiLSTM CRF classifier
trained on Indian judgments. Evaluated on IL-PCR and COLIEE 2025 datasets,
TraceRetriever addresses growing document volume challenges while aligning with
practical search constraints, reliable and scalable foundation for precedent
retrieval enhancing legal research when only partial case knowledge is
available.

analysis: sentence-level style change detection. Benchmarking four LLMs on the
official PAN~2024 and 2025 "Multi-Author Writing Style Analysis" datasets, we
present several observations. First, state-of-the-art generative models are
sensitive to variations in writing style - even at the granular level of
individual sentences. Second, their accuracy establishes a challenging baseline
for the task, outperforming suggested baselines of the PAN competition.
Finally, we explore the influence of semantics on model predictions and present
evidence suggesting that the latest generation of LLMs may be more sensitive to
content-independent and purely stylistic signals than previously reported.

Motivation: 现有方法在印度法律背景下忽视了成文法规定和司法先例的重要性，NyayaRAG旨在填补这一空白。

Result: 结果显示，结合结构化法律知识的输入显著提升了预测准确性和解释质量。

Conclusion: NyayaRAG为法律判决预测提供了一种更有效且可解释的方法。

Abstract: Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) has emerged as a key area in AI for law,
aiming to automate judicial outcome forecasting and enhance interpretability in
legal reasoning. While previous approaches in the Indian context have relied on
internal case content such as facts, issues, and reasoning, they often overlook
a core element of common law systems, which is reliance on statutory provisions
and judicial precedents. In this work, we propose NyayaRAG, a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that simulates realistic
courtroom scenarios by providing models with factual case descriptions,
relevant legal statutes, and semantically retrieved prior cases. NyayaRAG
evaluates the effectiveness of these combined inputs in predicting court
decisions and generating legal explanations using a domain-specific pipeline
tailored to the Indian legal system. We assess performance across various input
configurations using both standard lexical and semantic metrics as well as
LLM-based evaluators such as G-Eval. Our results show that augmenting factual
inputs with structured legal knowledge significantly improves both predictive
accuracy and explanation quality.

Result: DAMR在多个KGQA基准测试中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DAMR通过动态自适应路径评估和伪路径优化，实现了高效且准确的KGQA。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) aims to interpret natural language
queries and perform structured reasoning over knowledge graphs by leveraging
their relational and semantic structures to retrieve accurate answers. Recent
KGQA methods primarily follow either retrieve-then-reason paradigm, relying on
GNNs or heuristic rules for static paths extraction, or dynamic path generation
strategies that use large language models (LLMs) with prompting to jointly
perform retrieval and reasoning. However, the former suffers from limited
adaptability due to static path extraction and lack of contextual refinement,
while the latter incurs high computational costs and struggles with accurate
path evaluation due to reliance on fixed scoring functions and extensive LLM
calls. To address these issues, this paper proposes Dynamically Adaptive
MCTS-based Reasoning (DAMR), a novel framework that integrates symbolic search
with adaptive path evaluation for efficient and context-aware KGQA. DAMR
employs a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) backbone guided by an LLM-based
planner, which selects top-$k$ relevant relations at each step to reduce search
space. To improve path evaluation accuracy, we introduce a lightweight
Transformer-based scorer that performs context-aware plausibility estimation by
jointly encoding the question and relation sequence through cross-attention,
enabling the model to capture fine-grained semantic shifts during multi-hop
reasoning. Furthermore, to alleviate the scarcity of high-quality supervision,
DAMR incorporates a dynamic pseudo-path refinement mechanism that periodically
generates training signals from partial paths explored during search, allowing
the scorer to continuously adapt to the evolving distribution of reasoning
trajectories. Extensive experiments on multiple KGQA benchmarks show that DAMR
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM是否能够利用训练数据进行推理，尤其是在缺乏直接对话示例的情况下，推断出合理解释。这对AI的情境意识和安全性具有重要意义。

Method: 通过训练LLM学习虚构聊天机器人的名称和行为描述（不包含对话示例），测试其能否根据特征性行为推断名称，并观察其是否表现出更符合描述的行为。

Result: GPT-4o能够根据行为特征推断聊天机器人名称，并在后续训练中表现出更符合描述的行为。

Conclusion: 研究表明LLM具备从训练数据中推理的能力，这对AI的情境意识和安全性有重要启示。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on large corpora, yet it is unclear
whether they can reason about the information present within their training
data. We design experiments to study out-of-context abduction in LLMs, the
ability to infer the most plausible explanations for observations using
relevant facts present in training data. We train treatment LLMs on names and
behavior descriptions of fictitious chatbots, but not on examples of dialogue
with the chatbots. We find that OpenAI's GPT 4o LLM can correctly infer at
least one chatbot's name after observing example responses characteristic of
that chatbot. We also find that previously training GPT 4o on descriptions of a
chatbot's behavior allows it to display behaviors more characteristic of the
chatbot when iteratively trained to display such behaviors. Our results have
implications for situational awareness in LLMs and, therefore, for AI safety.

Motivation: 验证生成代理能否准确代表人类群体的人格特征，为社会科学研究提供低成本替代方案。

Method: 使用GPT-4驱动的310个代理完成HEXACO人格测试，进行因子分析并与2004年原始结果对比。

Result: 代理的响应显示出与HEXACO框架部分一致的人格结构，且结果在GPT-4内一致可靠，但跨模型分析发现偏差。

Abstract: Generative agents powered by Large Language Models demonstrate human-like
characteristics through sophisticated natural language interactions. Their
ability to assume roles and personalities based on predefined character
biographies has positioned them as cost-effective substitutes for human
participants in social science research. This paper explores the validity of
such persona-based agents in representing human populations; we recreate the
HEXACO personality inventory experiment by surveying 310 GPT-4 powered agents,
conducting factor analysis on their responses, and comparing these results to
the original findings presented by Ashton, Lee, & Goldberg in 2004. Our results
found 1) a coherent and reliable personality structure was recoverable from the
agents' responses demonstrating partial alignment to the HEXACO framework. 2)
the derived personality dimensions were consistent and reliable within GPT-4,
when coupled with a sufficiently curated population, and 3) cross-model
analysis revealed variability in personality profiling, suggesting
model-specific biases and limitations. We discuss the practical considerations
and challenges encountered during the experiment. This study contributes to the
ongoing discourse on the potential benefits and limitations of using generative
agents in social science research and provides useful guidance on designing
consistent and representative agent personas to maximise coverage and
representation of human personality traits.

Motivation: 传统单步检索的RAG系统在处理复杂临床推理任务时表现有限，因此需要一种更灵活的方法来提升放射学问答的效果。

Method: 采用代理RAG框架，使LLMs能够自主分解问题、迭代检索临床证据并动态合成回答，评估了24种不同架构和规模的LLM。

Result: 代理检索显著提高了诊断准确性（73% vs. 64%），减少了幻觉（9.4%），并在46%的案例中检索到相关临床背景。

Conclusion: 代理框架在提升放射学问答的事实性和准确性方面具有潜力，尤其是对中等规模LLM，值得进一步临床验证。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making in radiology increasingly benefits from artificial
intelligence (AI), particularly through large language models (LLMs). However,
traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for radiology question
answering (QA) typically rely on single-step retrieval, limiting their ability
to handle complex clinical reasoning tasks. Here we propose an agentic RAG
framework enabling LLMs to autonomously decompose radiology questions,
iteratively retrieve targeted clinical evidence from Radiopaedia, and
dynamically synthesize evidence-based responses. We evaluated 24 LLMs spanning
diverse architectures, parameter scales (0.5B to >670B), and training paradigms
(general-purpose, reasoning-optimized, clinically fine-tuned), using 104
expert-curated radiology questions from previously established RSNA-RadioQA and
ExtendedQA datasets. Agentic retrieval significantly improved mean diagnostic
accuracy over zero-shot prompting (73% vs. 64%; P<0.001) and conventional
online RAG (73% vs. 68%; P<0.001). The greatest gains occurred in mid-sized
models (e.g., Mistral Large improved from 72% to 81%) and small-scale models
(e.g., Qwen 2.5-7B improved from 55% to 71%), while very large models (>200B
parameters) demonstrated minimal changes (<2% improvement). Additionally,
agentic retrieval reduced hallucinations (mean 9.4%) and retrieved clinically
relevant context in 46% of cases, substantially aiding factual grounding. Even
clinically fine-tuned models exhibited meaningful improvements (e.g.,
MedGemma-27B improved from 71% to 81%), indicating complementary roles of
retrieval and fine-tuning. These results highlight the potential of agentic
frameworks to enhance factuality and diagnostic accuracy in radiology QA,
particularly among mid-sized LLMs, warranting future studies to validate their
clinical utility.

Conclusion: GLiDRE在文档级关系抽取任务中表现出色，尤其在少样本设置下具有优势。

Abstract: Relation Extraction (RE) is a fundamental task in Natural Language

the need to model complex interactions between entities across sentences.
Current approaches, largely based on the ATLOP architecture, are commonly
evaluated on benchmarks like DocRED and Re-DocRED. However, their performance
in zero-shot or few-shot settings remains largely underexplored due to the
task's complexity. Recently, the GLiNER model has shown that a compact NER
model can outperform much larger Large Language Models. With a similar
motivation, we introduce GLiDRE, a new model for document-level relation
extraction that builds on the key ideas of GliNER. We benchmark GLiDRE against
state-of-the-art models across various data settings on the Re-DocRED dataset.
Our results demonstrate that GLiDRE achieves state-of-the-art performance in
few-shot scenarios. Our code is publicly available.

Conclusion: MMBERT通过多模态整合和渐进训练策略，有效提升了中文仇恨言论检测的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Hate speech detection on Chinese social networks presents distinct
challenges, particularly due to the widespread use of cloaking techniques
designed to evade conventional text-based detection systems. Although large
language models (LLMs) have recently improved hate speech detection
capabilities, the majority of existing work has concentrated on English
datasets, with limited attention given to multimodal strategies in the Chinese
context. In this study, we propose MMBERT, a novel BERT-based multimodal
framework that integrates textual, speech, and visual modalities through a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. To address the instability associated
with directly integrating MoE into BERT-based models, we develop a progressive
three-stage training paradigm. MMBERT incorporates modality-specific experts, a
shared self-attention mechanism, and a router-based expert allocation strategy
to enhance robustness against adversarial perturbations. Empirical results in
several Chinese hate speech datasets show that MMBERT significantly surpasses
fine-tuned BERT-based encoder models, fine-tuned LLMs, and LLMs utilizing
in-context learning approaches.

perform question answering on given tabular datasets from diverse domains under
two subtasks: DataBench QA (Subtask I) and DataBench Lite QA (Subtask II). To
tackle both subtasks, we developed a zero-shot solution with a particular
emphasis on leveraging Large Language Model (LLM)-based code generation.
Specifically, we propose a Python code generation framework utilizing
state-of-the-art open-source LLMs to generate executable Pandas code via
optimized prompting strategies. Our experiments reveal that different LLMs
exhibit varying levels of effectiveness in Python code generation.
Additionally, results show that Python code generation achieves superior
performance in tabular question answering compared to alternative approaches.
Although our ranking among zero-shot systems is unknown at the time of this

Motivation: 研究动机是解决LLMs在敏感语境下（如公平性和包容性）的代词使用问题，特别是性别中立和新代词，以推动负责任的AI发展。

Method: 方法是通过MISGENDERED+基准测试，评估五种LLMs（GPT-4o、Claude 4、DeepSeek-V3、Qwen Turbo和Qwen2.5）在零样本、少样本和性别身份推理任务中的表现。

Result: 结果显示，模型在二元和性别中立代词上的准确性有显著提升，但在新代词和反向推理任务上表现不一致，表明身份敏感推理仍存在缺陷。

Conclusion: 结论指出，尽管有进步，LLMs在包容性代词处理上仍有改进空间，未来研究需进一步关注身份敏感的推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive contexts
where fairness and inclusivity are critical. Pronoun usage, especially
concerning gender-neutral and neopronouns, remains a key challenge for
responsible AI. Prior work, such as the MISGENDERED benchmark, revealed
significant limitations in earlier LLMs' handling of inclusive pronouns, but
was constrained to outdated models and limited evaluations. In this study, we
introduce MISGENDERED+, an extended and updated benchmark for evaluating LLMs'
pronoun fidelity. We benchmark five representative LLMs, GPT-4o, Claude 4,
DeepSeek-V3, Qwen Turbo, and Qwen2.5, across zero-shot, few-shot, and gender
identity inference. Our results show notable improvements compared with
previous studies, especially in binary and gender-neutral pronoun accuracy.
However, accuracy on neopronouns and reverse inference tasks remains
inconsistent, underscoring persistent gaps in identity-sensitive reasoning. We
discuss implications, model-specific observations, and avenues for future
inclusive AI research.

TL;DR: DAEDAL是一种无需训练的去噪策略，通过动态自适应长度扩展解决扩散大语言模型（DLLMs）的静态长度限制问题，提升计算效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型（DLLMs）因静态预定义生成长度的限制，导致性能与计算效率的权衡问题。

Method: DAEDAL分两阶段操作：1）在去噪前从短初始长度迭代扩展至任务合适长度；2）在去噪过程中动态扩展不足生成区域。

Result: DAEDAL在性能上与固定长度基线相当或更优，同时提高计算效率。

Conclusion: DAEDAL解决了DLLMs的静态长度限制，为其与自回归模型的竞争铺平道路。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) are emerging as a powerful
alternative to the dominant Autoregressive Large Language Models, offering
efficient parallel generation and capable global context modeling. However, the
practical application of DLLMs is hindered by a critical architectural
constraint: the need for a statically predefined generation length. This static
length allocation leads to a problematic trade-off: insufficient lengths
cripple performance on complex tasks, while excessive lengths incur significant
computational overhead and sometimes result in performance degradation. While
the inference framework is rigid, we observe that the model itself possesses
internal signals that correlate with the optimal response length for a given
task. To bridge this gap, we leverage these latent signals and introduce
DAEDAL, a novel training-free denoising strategy that enables Dynamic Adaptive
Length Expansion for Diffusion Large Language Models. DAEDAL operates in two
phases: 1) Before the denoising process, DAEDAL starts from a short initial
length and iteratively expands it to a coarse task-appropriate length, guided
by a sequence completion metric. 2) During the denoising process, DAEDAL
dynamically intervenes by pinpointing and expanding insufficient generation
regions through mask token insertion, ensuring the final output is fully
developed. Extensive experiments on DLLMs demonstrate that DAEDAL achieves
performance comparable, and in some cases superior, to meticulously tuned
fixed-length baselines, while simultaneously enhancing computational efficiency
by achieving a higher effective token ratio. By resolving the static length
constraint, DAEDAL unlocks new potential for DLLMs, bridging a critical gap
with their Autoregressive counterparts and paving the way for more efficient
and capable generation.

### [46] [A Quality-Guided Mixture of Score-Fusion Experts Framework for Human Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00053)
*Jie Zhu,Yiyang Su,Minchul Kim,Anil Jain,Xiaoming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于质量引导的专家混合分数融合框架（QME），用于提升多模态全身生物识别性能，通过可学习的分数融合策略解决了传统方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态生物识别方法通过分数融合（如加权平均）整合不同模态，但忽略了各模态分数分布的差异，限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出QME框架，结合专家混合（MoE）和可学习分数融合策略，引入伪质量损失和质量估计器（QE），以及分数三元组损失优化度量性能。

Result: 在多个全身生物识别数据集上实验表明，QME在各项指标上均优于基线方法，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: QME有效解决了多模态和多模型中的关键挑战，如相似性分数域中的模型不对齐和数据质量变化。

Abstract: Whole-body biometric recognition is a challenging multimodal task that
integrates various biometric modalities, including face, gait, and body. This
integration is essential for overcoming the limitations of unimodal systems.
Traditionally, whole-body recognition involves deploying different models to
process multiple modalities, achieving the final outcome by score-fusion (e.g.,
weighted averaging of similarity matrices from each model). However, these
conventional methods may overlook the variations in score distributions of
individual modalities, making it challenging to improve final performance. In
this work, we present \textbf{Q}uality-guided \textbf{M}ixture of score-fusion
\textbf{E}xperts (QME), a novel framework designed for improving whole-body
biometric recognition performance through a learnable score-fusion strategy
using a Mixture of Experts (MoE). We introduce a novel pseudo-quality loss for
quality estimation with a modality-specific Quality Estimator (QE), and a score
triplet loss to improve the metric performance. Extensive experiments on
multiple whole-body biometric datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed approach, achieving state-of-the-art results across various metrics
compared to baseline methods. Our method is effective for multimodal and
multi-model, addressing key challenges such as model misalignment in the
similarity score domain and variability in data quality.

*Raiyaan Abdullah,Jared Claypoole,Michael Cogswell,Ajay Divakaran,Yogesh Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了动作识别模型在跨多样上下文中的高级运动概念迁移能力，发现模型在新颖场景中性能显著下降，并提出了改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动作识别模型是否能有效迁移高级运动概念到不同上下文，尤其是在类似分布中。

Method: 引入了一个运动可迁移性框架，使用三个数据集（Syn-TA、Kinetics400-TA、Something-Something-v2-TA），评估了13个先进模型。

Result: 模型在新颖上下文中的高级动作识别性能显著下降；多模态模型在细粒度未知动作上表现更差；大型模型在空间线索主导时表现更好，但在时间推理上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究为动作识别中的运动可迁移性评估提供了重要基准，并提出了改进方向。

Abstract: Action recognition models demonstrate strong generalization, but can they
effectively transfer high-level motion concepts across diverse contexts, even
within similar distributions? For example, can a model recognize the broad
action "punching" when presented with an unseen variation such as "punching
person"? To explore this, we introduce a motion transferability framework with
three datasets: (1) Syn-TA, a synthetic dataset with 3D object motions; (2)
Kinetics400-TA; and (3) Something-Something-v2-TA, both adapted from natural
video datasets. We evaluate 13 state-of-the-art models on these benchmarks and
observe a significant drop in performance when recognizing high-level actions
in novel contexts. Our analysis reveals: 1) Multimodal models struggle more
with fine-grained unknown actions than with coarse ones; 2) The bias-free
Syn-TA proves as challenging as real-world datasets, with models showing
greater performance drops in controlled settings; 3) Larger models improve
transferability when spatial cues dominate but struggle with intensive temporal
reasoning, while reliance on object and background cues hinders generalization.
We further explore how disentangling coarse and fine motions can improve
recognition in temporally challenging datasets. We believe this study
establishes a crucial benchmark for assessing motion transferability in action
recognition. Datasets and relevant code:

TL;DR: 论文介绍了Monado SLAM数据集，旨在解决头戴式传感器在复杂场景中跟踪性能不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉惯性里程计（VIO）和SLAM系统在头戴式设备的高强度运动、动态遮挡等复杂场景中表现不佳，缺乏相关数据集。

Method: 通过收集多款虚拟现实头戴设备的真实序列数据，构建Monado SLAM数据集。

Result: 发布了基于CC BY 4.0许可的数据集，以推动VIO/SLAM研究和开发。

Conclusion: Monado SLAM数据集填补了现有研究的空白，有助于改进头戴式设备的跟踪性能。

Abstract: Humanoid robots and mixed reality headsets benefit from the use of
head-mounted sensors for tracking. While advancements in visual-inertial
odometry (VIO) and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) have produced
new and high-quality state-of-the-art tracking systems, we show that these are
still unable to gracefully handle many of the challenging settings presented in
the head-mounted use cases. Common scenarios like high-intensity motions,
dynamic occlusions, long tracking sessions, low-textured areas, adverse
lighting conditions, saturation of sensors, to name a few, continue to be
covered poorly by existing datasets in the literature. In this way, systems may
inadvertently overlook these essential real-world issues. To address this, we
present the Monado SLAM dataset, a set of real sequences taken from multiple
virtual reality headsets. We release the dataset under a permissive CC BY 4.0
license, to drive advancements in VIO/SLAM research and development.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于卷积神经网络（CNN）的模型，专注于利用眼周区域（periocular region）的颜色图像进行性别分类，取得了高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 性别分类在安全、人机交互等领域至关重要，但化妆品和伪装等因素会影响分类准确性。因此，研究专注于眼周区域，以提取关键特征。

Method: 使用CNN模型分析眼周区域的颜色图像，并在CVBL和（Female and Male）两个数据集上进行测试。

Result: 模型在CVBL数据集上达到99%的准确率，在（Female and Male）数据集上达到96%的准确率，且参数较少。

Conclusion: 该模型在性别分类中表现出色，具有在安全和监控等领域实际应用的潜力。

Abstract: Gender classification has emerged as a crucial aspect in various fields,
including security, human-machine interaction, surveillance, and advertising.
Nonetheless, the accuracy of this classification can be influenced by factors
such as cosmetics and disguise. Consequently, our study is dedicated to
addressing this concern by concentrating on gender classification using color
images of the periocular region. The periocular region refers to the area
surrounding the eye, including the eyelids, eyebrows, and the region between
them. It contains valuable visual cues that can be used to extract key features
for gender classification. This paper introduces a sophisticated Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) model that utilizes color image databases to evaluate the
effectiveness of the periocular region for gender classification. To validate
the model's performance, we conducted tests on two eye datasets, namely CVBL
and (Female and Male). The recommended architecture achieved an outstanding
accuracy of 99% on the previously unused CVBL dataset while attaining a
commendable accuracy of 96% with a small number of learnable parameters
(7,235,089) on the (Female and Male) dataset. To ascertain the effectiveness of
our proposed model for gender classification using the periocular region, we
evaluated its performance through an extensive range of metrics and compared it
with other state-of-the-art approaches. The results unequivocally demonstrate
the efficacy of our model, thereby suggesting its potential for practical
application in domains such as security and surveillance.

*Akshat Rakheja,Aarsh Ashdhir,Aryan Bhattacharjee,Vanshika Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: World Consistency Score (WCS) 是一种新的生成视频模型评估指标，强调视频的内部世界一致性，通过四个可解释的子指标（物体持久性、关系稳定性、因果合规性和闪烁惩罚）综合计算，并与人类判断对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频评估指标主要关注视觉保真度或提示对齐，忽略了视频内部的世界一致性，WCS旨在填补这一空白。

Method: WCS 结合四个子指标，通过开源工具计算，并使用人类偏好数据训练权重，最终生成一致性分数。

Result: WCS 在多个基准测试中验证了与人类评估的相关性，并优于现有指标（如FVD、CLIPScore等）。

Conclusion: WCS 提供了一个全面且可解释的框架，用于评估视频生成模型在保持世界一致性方面的能力。

Abstract: We introduce World Consistency Score (WCS), a novel unified evaluation metric
for generative video models that emphasizes internal world consistency of the
generated videos. WCS integrates four interpretable sub-components - object
permanence, relation stability, causal compliance, and flicker penalty - each
measuring a distinct aspect of temporal and physical coherence in a video.
These submetrics are combined via a learned weighted formula to produce a
single consistency score that aligns with human judgments. We detail the
motivation for WCS in the context of existing video evaluation metrics,
formalize each submetric and how it is computed with open-source tools
(trackers, action recognizers, CLIP embeddings, optical flow), and describe how
the weights of the WCS combination are trained using human preference data. We
also outline an experimental validation blueprint: using benchmarks like
VBench-2.0, EvalCrafter, and LOVE to test WCS's correlation with human
evaluations, performing sensitivity analyses, and comparing WCS against
established metrics (FVD, CLIPScore, VBench, FVMD). The proposed WCS offers a
comprehensive and interpretable framework for evaluating video generation
models on their ability to maintain a coherent "world" over time, addressing
gaps left by prior metrics focused only on visual fidelity or prompt alignment.

### [51] [GeoExplorer: Active Geo-localization with Curiosity-Driven Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00152)
*Li Mi,Manon Bechaz,Zeming Chen,Antoine Bosselut,Devis Tuia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoExplorer提出了一种基于好奇心驱动探索的主动地理定位方法，通过内在奖励提升鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于距离奖励的方法在目标或环境未知时表现不佳，缺乏可靠探索策略。

Method: 引入好奇心驱动的内在奖励，实现目标无关的多样化探索。

Result: 在四个AGL基准测试中表现优异，尤其在未知目标和环境中。

Conclusion: GeoExplorer通过好奇心驱动探索显著提升了AGL任务的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Active Geo-localization (AGL) is the task of localizing a goal, represented
in various modalities (e.g., aerial images, ground-level images, or text),
within a predefined search area. Current methods approach AGL as a
goal-reaching reinforcement learning (RL) problem with a distance-based reward.
They localize the goal by implicitly learning to minimize the relative distance
from it. However, when distance estimation becomes challenging or when
encountering unseen targets and environments, the agent exhibits reduced
robustness and generalization ability due to the less reliable exploration
strategy learned during training. In this paper, we propose GeoExplorer, an AGL
agent that incorporates curiosity-driven exploration through intrinsic rewards.
Unlike distance-based rewards, our curiosity-driven reward is goal-agnostic,
enabling robust, diverse, and contextually relevant exploration based on
effective environment modeling. These capabilities have been proven through
extensive experiments across four AGL benchmarks, demonstrating the
effectiveness and generalization ability of GeoExplorer in diverse settings,
particularly in localizing unfamiliar targets and environments.

*Bhavya Goyal,Felipe Gutierrez-Barragan,Wei Lin,Andreas Velten,Yin Li,Mohit Gupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为概率点云（PPC）的新3D场景表示方法，通过为每个点添加概率属性来封装原始数据中的测量不确定性，从而提升3D物体检测的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代LiDAR在远距离或低反光物体等场景中会产生稀疏或错误的点云，这些误差会传播到下游感知模型，导致精度下降。传统3D处理流程未保留原始测量中的不确定性信息。

Method: 提出PPC表示方法，为每个点添加概率属性，并引入基于PPC的推理方法，可作为轻量级模块集成到3D推理流程中。

Result: 通过仿真和实际捕获数据验证，PPC方法在室内外场景中优于LiDAR及相机-LiDAR融合模型，尤其在处理小、远、低反光物体及强环境光时表现更优。

Conclusion: PPC通过保留测量不确定性信息，显著提升了3D物体检测的鲁棒性，适用于多种挑战性场景。

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D sensors provide point clouds, a canonical 3D representation
used in various scene understanding tasks. Modern LiDARs face key challenges in
several real-world scenarios, such as long-distance or low-albedo objects,
producing sparse or erroneous point clouds. These errors, which are rooted in
the noisy raw LiDAR measurements, get propagated to downstream perception
models, resulting in potentially severe loss of accuracy. This is because
conventional 3D processing pipelines do not retain any uncertainty information
from the raw measurements when constructing point clouds.
  We propose Probabilistic Point Clouds (PPC), a novel 3D scene representation
where each point is augmented with a probability attribute that encapsulates
the measurement uncertainty (or confidence) in the raw data. We further
introduce inference approaches that leverage PPC for robust 3D object
detection; these methods are versatile and can be used as computationally
lightweight drop-in modules in 3D inference pipelines. We demonstrate, via both
simulations and real captures, that PPC-based 3D inference methods outperform
several baselines using LiDAR as well as camera-LiDAR fusion models, across
challenging indoor and outdoor scenarios involving small, distant, and
low-albedo objects, as well as strong ambient light.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种选择性模态转移（SMS）方法，用于量化视觉语言模型（VLMs）在二元分类任务中对不同模态的依赖，揭示了模型对文本输入的显著偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策依赖于医学图像和相关临床报告的综合分析，但现有VLMs常偏向单一模态，忽视视觉线索。

Method: 通过系统交换样本中的图像或文本，评估模型在扰动和未扰动设置下的性能，并结合注意力分析。

Result: 实验显示模型对文本输入的依赖显著，视觉信息常被忽视。

Conclusion: 设计多模态医学模型时应真正整合视觉和文本线索，而非依赖单一模态信号。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making relies on the integrated analysis of medical images
and the associated clinical reports. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can
offer a unified framework for such tasks, they can exhibit strong biases toward
one modality, frequently overlooking critical visual cues in favor of textual
information. In this work, we introduce Selective Modality Shifting (SMS), a
perturbation-based approach to quantify a model's reliance on each modality in
binary classification tasks. By systematically swapping images or text between
samples with opposing labels, we expose modality-specific biases. We assess six
open-source VLMs-four generalist models and two fine-tuned for medical data-on
two medical imaging datasets with distinct modalities: MIMIC-CXR (chest X-ray)
and FairVLMed (scanning laser ophthalmoscopy). By assessing model performance
and the calibration of every model in both unperturbed and perturbed settings,
we reveal a marked dependency on text input, which persists despite the
presence of complementary visual information. We also perform a qualitative
attention-based analysis which further confirms that image content is often
overshadowed by text details. Our findings highlight the importance of
designing and evaluating multimodal medical models that genuinely integrate
visual and textual cues, rather than relying on single-modality signals.

Conclusion: 结论表明，该方法为分层模型架构和局部算法提供了高效的工具，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Graphs, and sequences of growing graphs, can be used to specify the
architecture of mathematical models in many fields including machine learning
and computational science. Here we define structured graph "lineages" (ordered
by level number) that grow in a hierarchical fashion, so that: (1) the number
of graph vertices and edges increases exponentially in level number; (2)
bipartite graphs connect successive levels within a graph lineage and, as in
multigrid methods, can constrain matrices relating successive levels; (3) using
prolongation maps within a graph lineage, process-derived distance measures
between graphs at successive levels can be defined; (4) a category of "graded
graphs" can be defined, and using it low-cost "skeletal" variants of standard
algebraic graph operations and type constructors (cross product, box product,
disjoint sum, and function types) can be derived for graded graphs and hence
hierarchical graph lineages; (5) these skeletal binary operators have similar
but not identical algebraic and category-theoretic properties to their standard
counterparts; (6) graph lineages and their skeletal product constructors can
approach continuum limit objects. Additional space-efficient unary operators on
graded graphs are also derived: thickening, which creates a graph lineage of
multiscale graphs, and escalation to a graph lineage of search frontiers
(useful as a generalization of adaptive grids and in defining "skeletal"
functions). The result is an algebraic type theory for graded graphs and
(hierarchical) graph lineages. The approach is expected to be well suited to
defining hierarchical model architectures - "hierarchitectures" - and local
sampling, search, or optimization algorithms on them. We demonstrate such
application to deep neural networks (including visual and feature scale spaces)
and to multigrid numerical methods.

Result: 通过模拟内部认知和2D-GNN，显著提升了真实人格识别的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过模拟内部认知和2D图表示，有效解决了真实人格识别中的偏差问题。

Abstract: Automatic real personality recognition (RPR) aims to evaluate human real
personality traits from their expressive behaviours. However, most existing
solutions generally act as external observers to infer observers' personality
impressions based on target individuals' expressive behaviours, which
significantly deviate from their real personalities and consistently lead to
inferior recognition performance. Inspired by the association between real
personality and human internal cognition underlying the generation of
expressive behaviours, we propose a novel RPR approach that efficiently
simulates personalised internal cognition from easy-accessible external short
audio-visual behaviours expressed by the target individual. The simulated
personalised cognition, represented as a set of network weights that enforce
the personalised network to reproduce the individual-specific facial reactions,
is further encoded as a novel graph containing two-dimensional node and edge
feature matrices, with a novel 2D Graph Neural Network (2D-GNN) proposed for
inferring real personality traits from it. To simulate real personality-related
cognition, an end-to-end strategy is designed to jointly train our cognition
simulation, 2D graph construction, and personality recognition modules.

Result: 在COD10K、COCO和ADE20K数据集上，语义提示显著优于纯空间提示基线。

Conclusion: 语义条件集成是高效适配SAM的可行路径，计算复杂度低且性能提升显著。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated impressive generalization
in prompt-based segmentation. Yet, the potential of semantic text prompts
remains underexplored compared to traditional spatial prompts like points and
boxes. This paper introduces SAM-PTx, a parameter-efficient approach for
adapting SAM using frozen CLIP-derived text embeddings as class-level semantic
guidance. Specifically, we propose a lightweight adapter design called
Parallel-Text that injects text embeddings into SAM's image encoder, enabling
semantics-guided segmentation while keeping most of the original architecture
frozen. Our adapter modifies only the MLP-parallel branch of each transformer
block, preserving the attention pathway for spatial reasoning. Through
supervised experiments and ablations on the COD10K dataset as well as low-data
subsets of COCO and ADE20K, we show that incorporating fixed text embeddings as
input improves segmentation performance over purely spatial prompt baselines.
To our knowledge, this is the first work to use text prompts for segmentation
on the COD10K dataset. These results suggest that integrating semantic
conditioning into SAM's architecture offers a practical and scalable path for
efficient adaptation with minimal computational complexity.

TL;DR: 在少样本图像分类中，通过引入物体局部位置信息显著提升性能，使用Segment Anything Model或非监督前景提取方法即可实现大部分改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 少样本图像分类中，图像模糊（如多物体或复杂背景）会显著降低性能，因此需要引入额外信息以提升分类效果。

Method: 利用物体在图像中的局部位置信息，结合Segment Anything Model（仅需标记物体一个像素）或非监督前景提取方法。

Conclusion: 通过简单标记或非监督方法引入局部位置信息，可有效提升少样本图像分类性能。

Abstract: In the domain of Few-Shot Image Classification, operating with as little as
one example per class, the presence of image ambiguities stemming from multiple
objects or complex backgrounds can significantly deteriorate performance. Our
research demonstrates that incorporating additional information about the local
positioning of an object within its image markedly enhances classification
across established benchmarks. More importantly, we show that a significant
fraction of the improvement can be achieved through the use of the Segment
Anything Model, requiring only a pixel of the object of interest to be pointed
out, or by employing fully unsupervised foreground object extraction methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卷积神经网络在长距离依赖和全局上下文建模方面存在局限，而Transformer的计算复杂度和内存消耗较高，限制了高分辨率深度图的处理能力。

Method: 设计了结合残差密集通道注意力块和Mamba状态空间模块的结构，利用多尺度跨模态融合策略，通过彩色图像的高频纹理信息引导深度图超分辨率。

Result: 模型在多个公开数据集上验证了有效性，尤其在大型深度图超分辨率任务中表现出优秀的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MSF-UM模型在减少参数的同时提升了重建精度，为深度图超分辨率提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Depth map super-resolution technology aims to improve the spatial resolution
of low-resolution depth maps and effectively restore high-frequency detail
information. Traditional convolutional neural network has limitations in
dealing with long-range dependencies and are unable to fully model the global
contextual information in depth maps. Although transformer can model global
dependencies, its computational complexity and memory consumption are
quadratic, which significantly limits its ability to process high-resolution
depth maps. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale fusion U-shaped Mamba
(MSF-UM) model, a novel guided depth map super-resolution framework. The core
innovation of this model is to integrate Mamba's efficient state-space modeling
capabilities into a multi-scale U-shaped fusion structure guided by a color
image. The structure combining the residual dense channel attention block and
the Mamba state space module is designed, which combines the local feature
extraction capability of the convolutional layer with the modeling advantage of
the state space model for long-distance dependencies. At the same time, the
model adopts a multi-scale cross-modal fusion strategy to make full use of the
high-frequency texture information from the color image to guide the
super-resolution process of the depth map. Compared with existing mainstream
methods, the proposed MSF-UM significantly reduces the number of model
parameters while achieving better reconstruction accuracy. Extensive
experiments on multiple publicly available datasets validate the effectiveness
of the model, especially showing excellent generalization ability in the task
of large-scale depth map super-resolution.

Method: 提出点云引导的高斯基元解码器和GPU加速的2D掩码渲染系统，实现快速3D分割和多视图一致性。

Result: 在多视图mIoU上性能提升1.89%至31.78%，并保持高效计算。

Conclusion: PointGauss在3D分割任务中表现出色，同时提出了新数据集DesktopObjects-360以解决现有基准的局限性。

Abstract: We introduce PointGauss, a novel point cloud-guided framework for real-time
multi-object segmentation in Gaussian Splatting representations. Unlike
existing methods that suffer from prolonged initialization and limited
multi-view consistency, our approach achieves efficient 3D segmentation by
directly parsing Gaussian primitives through a point cloud segmentation-driven
pipeline. The key innovation lies in two aspects: (1) a point cloud-based
Gaussian primitive decoder that generates 3D instance masks within 1 minute,
and (2) a GPU-accelerated 2D mask rendering system that ensures multi-view
consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements over
previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving performance gains of 1.89 to
31.78% in multi-view mIoU, while maintaining superior computational efficiency.
To address the limitations of current benchmarks (single-object focus,
inconsistent 3D evaluation, small scale, and partial coverage), we present
DesktopObjects-360, a novel comprehensive dataset for 3D segmentation in
radiance fields, featuring: (1) complex multi-object scenes, (2) globally
consistent 2D annotations, (3) large-scale training data (over 27 thousand 2D
masks), (4) full 360{\deg} coverage, and (5) 3D evaluation masks.

Abstract: Continual learning enables pre-trained generative vision-language models
(VLMs) to incorporate knowledge from new tasks without retraining data from
previous ones. Recent methods update a visual projector to translate visual
information for new tasks, connecting pre-trained vision encoders with large
language models. However, such adjustments may cause the models to prioritize
visual inputs over language instructions, particularly learning tasks with
repetitive types of textual instructions. To address the neglect of language
instructions, we propose a novel framework that grounds the translation of
visual information on instructions for language models. We introduce a mixture
of visual projectors, each serving as a specialized visual-to-language
translation expert based on the given instruction context to adapt to new
tasks. To avoid using experts for irrelevant instruction contexts, we propose
an expert recommendation strategy that reuses experts for tasks similar to
those previously learned. Additionally, we introduce expert pruning to
alleviate interference from the use of experts that cumulatively activated in
previous tasks. Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language tasks
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing continual learning approaches
by generating instruction-following responses.

Abstract: Multimodal referring segmentation aims to segment target objects in visual
scenes, such as images, videos, and 3D scenes, based on referring expressions
in text or audio format. This task plays a crucial role in practical
applications requiring accurate object perception based on user instructions.
Over the past decade, it has gained significant attention in the multimodal
community, driven by advances in convolutional neural networks, transformers,
and large language models, all of which have substantially improved multimodal
perception capabilities. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of
multimodal referring segmentation. We begin by introducing this field's
background, including problem definitions and commonly used datasets. Next, we
summarize a unified meta architecture for referring segmentation and review
representative methods across three primary visual scenes, including images,
videos, and 3D scenes. We further discuss Generalized Referring Expression
(GREx) methods to address the challenges of real-world complexity, along with
related tasks and practical applications. Extensive performance comparisons on
standard benchmarks are also provided. We continually track related works at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个评估语义对应在恶劣条件下鲁棒性的新基准，发现现有方法在挑战性场景中表现下降，大模型能提升鲁棒性但微调会降低相对鲁棒性，DINO模型表现优于Stable Diffusion。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义对应是计算机视觉中的基础任务，但在挑战性场景中的鲁棒性研究较少，因此需要建立新基准来评估。

Method: 构建包含14种挑战性场景的基准数据集，评估现有语义对应方法及大模型（如DINO和Stable Diffusion）的表现。

Result: 现有方法在恶劣条件下性能下降；大模型提升鲁棒性但微调降低相对鲁棒性；DINO优于Stable Diffusion，融合两者效果更好；通用数据增强无效。

Conclusion: 需针对任务设计鲁棒性增强策略，大模型融合是提升绝对鲁棒性的有效途径。

Abstract: Semantic correspondence aims to identify semantically meaningful
relationships between different images and is a fundamental challenge in
computer vision. It forms the foundation for numerous tasks such as 3D
reconstruction, object tracking, and image editing. With the progress of
large-scale vision models, semantic correspondence has achieved remarkable
performance in controlled and high-quality conditions. However, the robustness
of semantic correspondence in challenging scenarios is much less investigated.
In this work, we establish a novel benchmark for evaluating semantic
correspondence in adverse conditions. The benchmark dataset comprises 14
distinct challenging scenarios that reflect commonly encountered imaging
issues, including geometric distortion, image blurring, digital artifacts, and
environmental occlusion. Through extensive evaluations, we provide several key
insights into the robustness of semantic correspondence approaches: (1) All
existing methods suffer from noticeable performance drops under adverse
conditions; (2) Using large-scale vision models can enhance overall robustness,
but fine-tuning on these models leads to a decline in relative robustness; (3)
The DINO model outperforms the Stable Diffusion in relative robustness, and
their fusion achieves better absolute robustness; Moreover, We evaluate common
robustness enhancement strategies for semantic correspondence and find that
general data augmentations are ineffective, highlighting the need for
task-specific designs. These results are consistent across both our dataset and
real-world benchmarks.

Abstract: Driver drowsiness is one of the main causes of road accidents and is
recognized as a leading contributor to traffic-related fatalities. However,
detecting drowsiness accurately remains a challenging task, especially in
real-world settings where facial data from different individuals is
decentralized and highly diverse. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
for drowsiness detection that is designed to work effectively with
heterogeneous and decentralized data. Our approach develops a new Spatial
Self-Attention (SSA) mechanism integrated with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
network to better extract key facial features and improve detection
performance. To support federated learning, we employ a Gradient Similarity
Comparison (GSC) that selects the most relevant trained models from different
operators before aggregation. This improves the accuracy and robustness of the
global model while preserving user privacy. We also develop a customized tool
that automatically processes video data by extracting frames, detecting and
cropping faces, and applying data augmentation techniques such as rotation,
flipping, brightness adjustment, and zooming. Experimental results show that
our framework achieves a detection accuracy of 89.9% in the federated learning
settings, outperforming existing methods under various deployment scenarios.
The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling
real-world data variability and highlight its potential for deployment in
intelligent transportation systems to enhance road safety through early and
reliable drowsiness detection.

Conclusion: TITAN-Guide不仅降低了内存需求，还在多个扩散引导基准测试中显著提升了性能，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: In the recent development of conditional diffusion models still require heavy
supervised fine-tuning for performing control on a category of tasks.
Training-free conditioning via guidance with off-the-shelf models is a
favorable alternative to avoid further fine-tuning on the base model. However,
the existing training-free guidance frameworks either have heavy memory
requirements or offer sub-optimal control due to rough estimation. These
shortcomings limit the applicability to control diffusion models that require
intense computation, such as Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models. In this
work, we propose Taming Inference Time Alignment for Guided Text-to-Video
Diffusion Model, so-called TITAN-Guide, which overcomes memory space issues,
and provides more optimal control in the guidance process compared to the
counterparts. In particular, we develop an efficient method for optimizing
diffusion latents without backpropagation from a discriminative guiding model.
In particular, we study forward gradient descents for guided diffusion tasks
with various options on directional directives. In our experiments, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in efficiently managing memory
during latent optimization, while previous methods fall short. Our proposed
approach not only minimizes memory requirements but also significantly enhances
T2V performance across a range of diffusion guidance benchmarks. Code, models,
and demo are available at https://titanguide.github.io.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实现单一网络对不同动态对象的统一理解，解决生物研究中动物姿态和形状估计的数据稀缺和网络容量限制问题。

Method: 采用家族感知ViT和MoE设计，分区网络层为特定类群和共享组件；引入扩散生成合成数据集CtrlAni3D和CtrlAVES3D。

Result: 在41.3k哺乳动物和12.4k鸟类图像上训练，性能优于现有方法，尤其在Animal Kingdom数据集上表现突出。

Conclusion: AniMer+的网络架构和合成数据集有效提升了实际应用性能，填补了鸟类3D数据空白。

Abstract: In the era of foundation models, achieving a unified understanding of
different dynamic objects through a single network has the potential to empower
stronger spatial intelligence. Moreover, accurate estimation of animal pose and
shape across diverse species is essential for quantitative analysis in
biological research. However, this topic remains underexplored due to the
limited network capacity of previous methods and the scarcity of comprehensive
multi-species datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce AniMer+, an
extended version of our scalable AniMer framework. In this paper, we focus on a
unified approach for reconstructing mammals (mammalia) and birds (aves). A key
innovation of AniMer+ is its high-capacity, family-aware Vision Transformer
(ViT) incorporating a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design. Its architecture
partitions network layers into taxa-specific components (for mammalia and aves)
and taxa-shared components, enabling efficient learning of both distinct and
common anatomical features within a single model. To overcome the critical
shortage of 3D training data, especially for birds, we introduce a
diffusion-based conditional image generation pipeline. This pipeline produces
two large-scale synthetic datasets: CtrlAni3D for quadrupeds and CtrlAVES3D for
birds. To note, CtrlAVES3D is the first large-scale, 3D-annotated dataset for
birds, which is crucial for resolving single-view depth ambiguities. Trained on
an aggregated collection of 41.3k mammalian and 12.4k avian images (combining
real and synthetic data), our method demonstrates superior performance over
existing approaches across a wide range of benchmarks, including the
challenging out-of-domain Animal Kingdom dataset. Ablation studies confirm the
effectiveness of both our novel network architecture and the generated
synthetic datasets in enhancing real-world application performance.

Conclusion: 该方法为多视角行人视频生成提供了鲁棒且通用的解决方案，适用于自动驾驶中的数据增强和场景模拟。

Abstract: Pedestrian detection models in autonomous driving systems often lack
robustness due to insufficient representation of dangerous pedestrian scenarios
in training datasets. To address this limitation, we present a novel framework
for controllable pedestrian video editing in multi-view driving scenarios by
integrating video inpainting and human motion control techniques. Our approach
begins by identifying pedestrian regions of interest across multiple camera
views, expanding detection bounding boxes with a fixed ratio, and resizing and
stitching these regions into a unified canvas while preserving cross-view
spatial relationships. A binary mask is then applied to designate the editable
area, within which pedestrian editing is guided by pose sequence control
conditions. This enables flexible editing functionalities, including pedestrian
insertion, replacement, and removal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves high-quality pedestrian editing with strong visual realism,
spatiotemporal coherence, and cross-view consistency. These results establish
the proposed method as a robust and versatile solution for multi-view
pedestrian video generation, with broad potential for applications in data
augmentation and scenario simulation in autonomous driving.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段低光图像增强方法，利用事件相机的高动态范围和低延迟特性，通过解耦可见性恢复和结构细化，结合动态对齐和对比损失，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未充分利用事件相机和帧相机的模态优势，限制了性能提升。

Method: 分为可见性恢复和结构细化两阶段：前者通过傅里叶空间的振幅-相位纠缠设计网络，后者采用动态对齐融合策略解决空间不匹配问题，并结合对比损失优化。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有最先进模型。

Conclusion: 通过解耦两阶段和动态对齐策略，有效提升了低光图像增强的性能。

Abstract: The event camera, benefiting from its high dynamic range and low latency,
provides performance gain for low-light image enhancement. Unlike frame-based
cameras, it records intensity changes with extremely high temporal resolution,
capturing sufficient structure information. Currently, existing event-based
methods feed a frame and events directly into a single model without fully
exploiting modality-specific advantages, which limits their performance.
Therefore, by analyzing the role of each sensing modality, the enhancement
pipeline is decoupled into two stages: visibility restoration and structure
refinement. In the first stage, we design a visibility restoration network with
amplitude-phase entanglement by rethinking the relationship between amplitude
and phase components in Fourier space. In the second stage, a fusion strategy
with dynamic alignment is proposed to mitigate the spatial mismatch caused by
the temporal resolution discrepancy between two sensing modalities, aiming to
refine the structure information of the image enhanced by the visibility
restoration network. In addition, we utilize spatial-frequency interpolation to
simulate negative samples with diverse illumination, noise and artifact
degradations, thereby developing a contrastive loss that encourages the model
to learn discriminative representations. Experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for mathematical formula is essential for
the intelligent analysis of scientific literature. However, both task-specific

and challenging dataset that encompasses multidisciplinary and structurally
complex formulas at the line, paragraph, and page levels. Through
straightforward supervised fine-tuning, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance across a variety of styles, scientific domains, and complex
layouts. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only surpasses
specialized models in terms of accuracy and robustness, but also establishes a
new paradigm for the automated understanding of complex scientific documents.

Conclusion: GV-VAD框架通过低成本生成合成视频，有效提升了视频异常检测的性能。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) plays a critical role in public safety
applications such as intelligent surveillance. However, the rarity,
unpredictability, and high annotation cost of real-world anomalies make it
difficult to scale VAD datasets, which limits the performance and
generalization ability of existing models. To address this challenge, we
propose a generative video-enhanced weakly-supervised video anomaly detection
(GV-VAD) framework that leverages text-conditioned video generation models to
produce semantically controllable and physically plausible synthetic videos.
These virtual videos are used to augment training data at low cost. In
addition, a synthetic sample loss scaling strategy is utilized to control the
influence of generated synthetic samples for efficient training. The
experiments show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on UCF-Crime datasets. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种个性化引导方法，通过未学习的弱模型和动态权重插值，平衡目标分布对齐与文本编辑能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如CFG和AG）在少样本微调时无法有效平衡目标分布对齐和原始模型知识保留。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能提升文本对齐和目标分布保真度，且无需额外计算开销。

Conclusion: 个性化引导方法简单有效，适用于多种微调策略。

Abstract: Personalizing text-to-image diffusion models is crucial for adapting the
pre-trained models to specific target concepts, enabling diverse image
generation. However, fine-tuning with few images introduces an inherent
trade-off between aligning with the target distribution (e.g., subject
fidelity) and preserving the broad knowledge of the original model (e.g., text
editability). Existing sampling guidance methods, such as classifier-free
guidance (CFG) and autoguidance (AG), fail to effectively guide the output
toward well-balanced space: CFG restricts the adaptation to the target
distribution, while AG compromises text alignment. To address these
limitations, we propose personalization guidance, a simple yet effective method
leveraging an unlearned weak model conditioned on a null text prompt. Moreover,
our method dynamically controls the extent of unlearning in a weak model
through weight interpolation between pre-trained and fine-tuned models during
inference. Unlike existing guidance methods, which depend solely on guidance
scales, our method explicitly steers the outputs toward a balanced latent space
without additional computational overhead. Experimental results demonstrate
that our proposed guidance can improve text alignment and target distribution
fidelity, integrating seamlessly with various fine-tuning strategies.

Result: 在合成和真实数据上的实验表明，该方法优于传统的基于参考目标的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效且实用，为相机光谱灵敏度校准提供了一种更简便的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces a practical and accurate calibration method for camera
spectral sensitivity using a diffraction grating. Accurate calibration of
camera spectral sensitivity is crucial for various computer vision tasks,
including color correction, illumination estimation, and material analysis.
Unlike existing approaches that require specialized narrow-band filters or
reference targets with known spectral reflectances, our method only requires an
uncalibrated diffraction grating sheet, readily available off-the-shelf. By
capturing images of the direct illumination and its diffracted pattern through
the grating sheet, our method estimates both the camera spectral sensitivity

Abstract: We present a Collaborative Agent-Based Framework for Multi-Image Reasoning.
Our approach tackles the challenge of interleaved multimodal reasoning across
diverse datasets and task formats by employing a dual-agent system: a

for final inference. The framework is fully automated, modular, and
training-free, enabling generalization across classification, question

images. We evaluate our method on 18 diverse datasets from the 2025 MIRAGE
Challenge (Track A), covering a broad spectrum of visual reasoning tasks
including document QA, visual comparison, dialogue-based understanding, and
scene-level inference. Our results demonstrate that LVLMs can effectively

Motivation: 传统多目标跟踪方法依赖静态坐标变换，忽视了车辆速度对观测噪声和参考帧变化的影响，导致高速动态场景中跟踪性能下降。

Method: 提出SG-LKF，结合MotionScaleNet（MSNet）动态预测关键参数，并引入自监督轨迹一致性损失以增强帧间关联和轨迹连续性。

Result: 在KITTI 2D MOT上以79.59% HOTA排名第一，KITTI 3D MOT上达到82.03% HOTA，nuScenes 3D MOT上比SimpleTrack提升2.2% AMOTA。

Conclusion: SG-LKF通过速度自适应建模显著提升了动态场景中的多目标跟踪性能。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) enables autonomous vehicles to continuously
perceive dynamic objects, supplying essential temporal cues for prediction,
behavior understanding, and safe planning. However, conventional
tracking-by-detection methods typically rely on static coordinate
transformations based on ego-vehicle poses, disregarding ego-vehicle
speed-induced variations in observation noise and reference frame changes,
which degrades tracking stability and accuracy in dynamic, high-speed
scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the critical role of ego-vehicle speed
in MOT and propose a Speed-Guided Learnable Kalman Filter (SG-LKF) that
dynamically adapts uncertainty modeling to ego-vehicle speed, significantly
improving stability and accuracy in highly dynamic scenarios. Central to SG-LKF
is MotionScaleNet (MSNet), a decoupled token-mixing and channel-mixing MLP that
adaptively predicts key parameters of SG-LKF. To enhance inter-frame
association and trajectory continuity, we introduce a self-supervised
trajectory consistency loss jointly optimized with semantic and positional
constraints. Extensive experiments show that SG-LKF ranks first among all
vision-based methods on KITTI 2D MOT with 79.59% HOTA, delivers strong results
on KITTI 3D MOT with 82.03% HOTA, and outperforms SimpleTrack by 2.2% AMOTA on
nuScenes 3D MOT.

Result: CoST在效率和准确性上均有提升，且兼容多数现有方法，降低传输带宽需求。

Conclusion: CoST通过统一时空融合，显著提升了协作感知的性能和效率。

Abstract: Collaborative perception shares information among different agents and helps
solving problems that individual agents may face, e.g., occlusions and small
sensing range. Prior methods usually separate the multi-agent fusion and
multi-time fusion into two consecutive steps. In contrast, this paper proposes
an efficient collaborative perception that aggregates the observations from
different agents (space) and different times into a unified spatio-temporal
space simultanesouly. The unified spatio-temporal space brings two benefits,
i.e., efficient feature transmission and superior feature fusion. 1) Efficient
feature transmission: each static object yields a single observation in the
spatial temporal space, and thus only requires transmission only once (whereas
prior methods re-transmit all the object features multiple times). 2) superior
feature fusion: merging the multi-agent and multi-time fusion into a unified
spatial-temporal aggregation enables a more holistic perspective, thereby
enhancing perception performance in challenging scenarios. Consequently, our
Collaborative perception with Spatio-temporal Transformer (CoST) gains
improvement in both efficiency and accuracy. Notably, CoST is not tied to any
specific method and is compatible with a majority of previous methods,
enhancing their accuracy while reducing the transmission bandwidth.

Conclusion: 所提方法在蜂蜜植物来源分类中表现优异，优于现有技术。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based method for automatically
classifying honey botanical origins. Dataset preparation, feature extraction,
and classification are the three main steps of the proposed method. We use a
class transformation method in the dataset preparation phase to maximize the
separability across classes. The feature extraction phase employs the Linear
Discriminant Analysis (LDA) technique for extracting relevant features and
reducing the number of dimensions. In the classification phase, we use Support
Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models to classify the
extracted features of honey samples into their botanical origins. We evaluate
our system using a standard honey hyperspectral imaging (HSI) dataset.
Experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed system produces
state-of-the-art results on this dataset, achieving the highest classification
accuracy of 95.13% for hyperspectral image-based classification and 92.80% for
hyperspectral instance-based classification.

*Liang Han,Xu Zhang,Haichuan Song,Kanle Shi,Yu-Shen Liu,Zhizhong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SparseRecon提出了一种新的稀疏视图神经隐式重建方法，通过体积渲染特征一致性和不确定性引导深度约束，解决了现有方法在未见视图和几何线索不足时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图重建的现有方法（泛化或过拟合）在未见视图或几何线索不足时表现不佳，需要改进。

Method: SparseRecon结合了体积渲染特征一致性损失和不确定性引导深度约束，以增强重建的完整性和几何细节。

Result: 实验表明，SparseRecon在稀疏视图输入下优于现有方法，尤其在小重叠视图场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: SparseRecon通过新方法显著提升了稀疏视图重建质量，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: Surface reconstruction from sparse views aims to reconstruct a 3D shape or
scene from few RGB images. The latest methods are either generalization-based
or overfitting-based. However, the generalization-based methods do not
generalize well on views that were unseen during training, while the
reconstruction quality of overfitting-based methods is still limited by the
limited geometry clues. To address this issue, we propose SparseRecon, a novel
neural implicit reconstruction method for sparse views with volume
rendering-based feature consistency and uncertainty-guided depth constraint.
Firstly, we introduce a feature consistency loss across views to constrain the
neural implicit field. This design alleviates the ambiguity caused by
insufficient consistency information of views and ensures completeness and
smoothness in the reconstruction results. Secondly, we employ an
uncertainty-guided depth constraint to back up the feature consistency loss in
areas with occlusion and insignificant features, which recovers geometry
details for better reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, which can produce
high-quality geometry with sparse-view input, especially in the scenarios with
small overlapping views. Project page: https://hanl2010.github.io/SparseRecon/.

*Joonmyung Choi,Sanghyeok Lee,Byungoh Ko,Eunseo Kim,Jihyung Kil,Hyunwoo J. Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Representation Shift的训练无关、模型无关的度量方法，用于衡量每个token表示的变化程度，从而与FlashAttention兼容地实现token压缩，显著提升了任务效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着任务复杂度的增加，Transformer模型的计算成本和GPU内存开销显著上升，现有token压缩方法与FlashAttention不兼容。

Method: 通过Representation Shift度量token表示的变化程度，无需依赖注意力图或重新训练，实现与FlashAttention兼容的token压缩。

Result: 在视频文本检索和视频问答任务中，分别实现了5.5%和4.4%的速度提升。

Conclusion: Representation Shift是一种高效且通用的token压缩方法，适用于多种模型，并与FlashAttention无缝集成。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success across vision, language,
and video. Yet, increasing task complexity has led to larger models and more
tokens, raising the quadratic cost of self-attention and the overhead of GPU
memory access. To reduce the computation cost of self-attention, prior work has
proposed token compression techniques that drop redundant or less informative
tokens. Meanwhile, fused attention kernels such as FlashAttention have been
developed to alleviate memory overhead by avoiding attention map construction
and its associated I/O to HBM. This, however, makes it incompatible with most
training-free token compression methods, which rely on attention maps to
determine token importance. Here, we propose Representation Shift, a
training-free, model-agnostic metric that measures the degree of change in each
token's representation. This seamlessly integrates token compression with
FlashAttention, without attention maps or retraining. Our method further
generalizes beyond Transformers to CNNs and state space models. Extensive
experiments show that Representation Shift enables effective token compression
compatible with FlashAttention, yielding significant speedups of up to 5.5% and
4.4% in video-text retrieval and video QA, respectively. Code is available at

Motivation: 传统方法因单向性限制了性能，难以捕捉场景中的语义子动作。

Method: 结合前向和后向预测，使用大语言模型BiAnt。

Conclusion: BiAnt通过双向预测显著提升了长期动作预测的性能。

Abstract: Video-based long-term action anticipation is crucial for early risk detection
in areas such as automated driving and robotics. Conventional approaches
extract features from past actions using encoders and predict future events
with decoders, which limits performance due to their unidirectional nature.
These methods struggle to capture semantically distinct sub-actions within a
scene. The proposed method, BiAnt, addresses this limitation by combining
forward prediction with backward prediction using a large language model.
Experimental results on Ego4D demonstrate that BiAnt improves performance in
terms of edit distance compared to baseline methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无损检测方法难以检测细微或内部缺陷，现有神经网络方法缺乏可解释性，影响部署安全性。

Result: 结合XAI技术和专家验证，提升了缺陷检测的性能和透明度。

Conclusion: 该研究增强了焊接缺陷检测系统的信任度、安全性和可靠性，适用于海洋和离岸环境。

Abstract: Weld defect detection is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of
piping systems in the oil and gas industry, especially in challenging marine
and offshore environments. Traditional non-destructive testing (NDT) methods
often fail to detect subtle or internal defects, leading to potential failures
and costly downtime. Furthermore, existing neural network-based approaches for
defect classification frequently rely on arbitrarily selected pretrained
architectures and lack interpretability, raising safety concerns for
deployment. To address these challenges, this paper introduces
``Adapt-WeldNet", an adaptive framework for welding defect detection that
systematically evaluates various pre-trained architectures, transfer learning
strategies, and adaptive optimizers to identify the best-performing model and
hyperparameters, optimizing defect detection and providing actionable insights.
Additionally, a novel Defect Detection Interpretability Analysis (DDIA)
framework is proposed to enhance system transparency. DDIA employs Explainable
AI (XAI) techniques, such as Grad-CAM and LIME, alongside domain-specific
evaluations validated by certified ASNT NDE Level II professionals.
Incorporating a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approach and aligning with the
principles of Trustworthy AI, DDIA ensures the reliability, fairness, and
accountability of the defect detection system, fostering confidence in
automated decisions through expert validation. By improving both performance
and interpretability, this work enhances trust, safety, and reliability in
welding defect detection systems, supporting critical operations in offshore
and marine environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间转录组学成本高且技术复杂，限制了临床应用。通过病理图像预测基因表达是一种实用替代方案，但现有ViT模型性能不足。

Method: 提出$MV_{Hybrid}$架构，结合SSMs和ViT，利用负实特征值初始化SSMs以增强低频模式捕捉能力。

Result: 在LOSO评估中，$MV_{Hybrid}$比最佳ViT模型相关性高57%，性能下降小43%，且在下游任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: $MV_{Hybrid}$是一种有前景的下一代病理视觉基础模型架构。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics reveals gene expression patterns within tissue
context, enabling precision oncology applications such as treatment response
prediction, but its high cost and technical complexity limit clinical adoption.
Predicting spatial gene expression (biomarkers) from routine histopathology
images offers a practical alternative, yet current vision foundation models
(VFMs) in pathology based on Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones perform below
clinical standards. Given that VFMs are already trained on millions of diverse
whole slide images, we hypothesize that architectural innovations beyond ViTs
may better capture the low-frequency, subtle morphological patterns correlating
with molecular phenotypes. By demonstrating that state space models initialized
with negative real eigenvalues exhibit strong low-frequency bias, we introduce
$MV_{Hybrid}$, a hybrid backbone architecture combining state space models
(SSMs) with ViT. We compare five other different backbone architectures for
pathology VFMs, all pretrained on identical colorectal cancer datasets using
the DINOv2 self-supervised learning method. We evaluate all pretrained models
using both random split and leave-one-study-out (LOSO) settings of the same
biomarker dataset. In LOSO evaluation, $MV_{Hybrid}$ achieves 57% higher
correlation than the best-performing ViT and shows 43% smaller performance
degradation compared to random split in gene expression prediction,
demonstrating superior performance and robustness, respectively. Furthermore,
$MV_{Hybrid}$ shows equal or better downstream performance in classification,
patch retrieval, and survival prediction tasks compared to that of ViT, showing
its promise as a next-generation pathology VFM backbone. Our code is publicly
available at: https://github.com/deepnoid-ai/MVHybrid.

Motivation: 传统方法因数据有限和多模态异步性导致融合效果不佳，多智能体系统在有限数据下表现优异，因此提出Cued-Agent以解决这一问题。

Result: 实验表明，Cued-Agent在正常和听力受损场景下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Cued-Agent通过协作多智能体设计，有效解决了多模态融合和有限数据的挑战，为CS识别提供了新思路。

Abstract: Cued Speech (CS) is a visual communication system that combines lip-reading
with hand coding to facilitate communication for individuals with hearing
impairments. Automatic CS Recognition (ACSR) aims to convert CS hand gestures
and lip movements into text via AI-driven methods. Traditionally, the temporal
asynchrony between hand and lip movements requires the design of complex
modules to facilitate effective multimodal fusion. However, constrained by
limited data availability, current methods demonstrate insufficient capacity
for adequately training these fusion mechanisms, resulting in suboptimal
performance. Recently, multi-agent systems have shown promising capabilities in
handling complex tasks with limited data availability. To this end, we propose
the first collaborative multi-agent system for ACSR, named Cued-Agent. It
integrates four specialized sub-agents: a Multimodal Large Language Model-based
Hand Recognition agent that employs keyframe screening and CS expert prompt
strategies to decode hand movements, a pretrained Transformer-based Lip
Recognition agent that extracts lip features from the input video, a Hand
Prompt Decoding agent that dynamically integrates hand prompts with lip
features during inference in a training-free manner, and a Self-Correction
Phoneme-to-Word agent that enables post-process and end-to-end conversion from
phoneme sequences to natural language sentences for the first time through
semantic refinement. To support this study, we expand the existing Mandarin CS
dataset by collecting data from eight hearing-impaired cuers, establishing a
mixed dataset of fourteen subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
Cued-Agent performs superbly in both normal and hearing-impaired scenarios
compared with state-of-the-art methods. The implementation is available at
https://github.com/DennisHgj/Cued-Agent.

Result: 在少样本学习、基础到新任务的泛化和数据高效学习中表现优异。

Conclusion: DAPT通过对称模态对齐和视觉注意力优化，显著提升了提示调优的效果。

Abstract: Prompt tuning (PT), as an emerging resource-efficient fine-tuning paradigm,
has showcased remarkable effectiveness in improving the task-specific
transferability of vision-language models. This paper delves into a previously
overlooked information asymmetry issue in PT, where the visual modality mostly
conveys more context than the object-oriented textual modality.
Correspondingly, coarsely aligning these two modalities could result in the
biased attention, driving the model to merely focus on the context area. To
address this, we propose DAPT, an effective PT framework based on an intuitive
decouple-before-align concept. First, we propose to explicitly decouple the
visual modality into the foreground and background representation via
exploiting coarse-and-fine visual segmenting cues, and then both of these
decoupled patterns are aligned with the original foreground texts and the
hand-crafted background classes, thereby symmetrically strengthening the modal
alignment. To further enhance the visual concentration, we propose a visual
pull-push regularization tailored for the foreground-background patterns,
directing the original visual representation towards unbiased attention on the
region-of-interest object. We demonstrate the power of architecture-free DAPT
through few-shot learning, base-to-novel generalization, and data-efficient
learning, all of which yield superior performance across prevailing benchmarks.
Our code will be released at https://github.com/Ferenas/DAPT.

Motivation: 随着基于扩散的视频生成模型的快速发展，合成内容越来越逼真，给视频伪造检测带来新挑战。现有方法难以捕捉细粒度的时间不一致性，尤其是在高视觉保真度和连贯运动的AI生成视频中。

Method: 采用双分支架构，一个分支分析RGB帧以检测外观层面的伪影，另一个分支处理光流残差以揭示由不完美时间合成引起的细微运动异常。通过整合这些互补特征，有效检测伪造视频。

Result: 在文本到视频和图像到视频任务上对十种不同生成模型进行了广泛实验，证明了该方法的鲁棒性和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过结合空间和时间特征，显著提升了AI生成视频的伪造检测能力。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion-based video generation models has led to
increasingly realistic synthetic content, presenting new challenges for video
forgery detection. Existing methods often struggle to capture fine-grained
temporal inconsistencies, particularly in AI-generated videos with high visual
fidelity and coherent motion. In this work, we propose a detection framework
that leverages spatial-temporal consistency by combining RGB appearance
features with optical flow residuals. The model adopts a dual-branch
architecture, where one branch analyzes RGB frames to detect appearance-level
artifacts, while the other processes flow residuals to reveal subtle motion
anomalies caused by imperfect temporal synthesis. By integrating these
complementary features, the proposed method effectively detects a wide range of
forged videos. Extensive experiments on text-to-video and image-to-video tasks
across ten diverse generative models demonstrate the robustness and strong
generalization ability of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive
generalization across diverse video understanding tasks under zero-shot
settings. However, their capabilities in high-stakes industrial domains-where
recognizing both routine operations and safety-critical anomalies is
essential-remain largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce
iSafetyBench, a new video-language benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
model performance in industrial environments across both normal and hazardous
scenarios. iSafetyBench comprises 1,100 video clips sourced from real-world
industrial settings, annotated with open-vocabulary, multi-label action tags
spanning 98 routine and 67 hazardous action categories. Each clip is paired
with multiple-choice questions for both single-label and multi-label
evaluation, enabling fine-grained assessment of VLMs in both standard and
safety-critical contexts. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art video-language
models under zero-shot conditions. Despite their strong performance on existing
video benchmarks, these models struggle with iSafetyBench-particularly in
recognizing hazardous activities and in multi-label scenarios. Our results
reveal significant performance gaps, underscoring the need for more robust,
safety-aware multimodal models for industrial applications. iSafetyBench
provides a first-of-its-kind testbed to drive progress in this direction. The

Abstract: Geometric distortions and blurring caused by atmospheric turbulence degrade
the quality of long-range dynamic scene videos. Existing methods struggle with
restoring edge details and eliminating mixed distortions, especially under
conditions of strong turbulence and complex dynamics. To address these
challenges, we introduce a Dynamic Efficiency Index ($DEI$), which combines
turbulence intensity, optical flow, and proportions of dynamic regions to
accurately quantify video dynamic intensity under varying turbulence conditions
and provide a high-dynamic turbulence training dataset. Additionally, we
propose a Physical Model-Driven Multi-Stage Video Restoration ($PMR$) framework
that consists of three stages: \textbf{de-tilting} for geometric stabilization,
\textbf{motion segmentation enhancement} for dynamic region refinement, and
\textbf{de-blurring} for quality restoration. $PMR$ employs lightweight
backbones and stage-wise joint training to ensure both efficiency and high
restoration quality. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively suppresses motion trailing artifacts, restores edge details and
exhibits strong generalization capability, especially in real-world scenarios
characterized by high-turbulence and complex dynamics. We will make the code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiTs的序列去噪过程导致高推理延迟，限制了实时应用。现有方法忽视了去噪阶段和Transformer块的语义变化。

Method: 提出Sortblock，动态缓存块级特征，基于残差演化排序自适应确定重计算比例，并加入轻量级线性预测减少误差。

Result: 实验表明，Sortblock在多种任务和DiT架构上实现2倍以上的推理加速，且输出质量几乎无损。

Conclusion: Sortblock为扩散生成模型提供了一种高效、通用的加速解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable generative
capabilities, particularly benefiting from Transformer architectures that
enhance visual and artistic fidelity. However, their inherently sequential
denoising process results in high inference latency, limiting their deployment
in real-time scenarios. Existing training-free acceleration approaches
typically reuse intermediate features at fixed timesteps or layers, overlooking
the evolving semantic focus across denoising stages and Transformer blocks.To
address this, we propose Sortblock, a training-free inference acceleration
framework that dynamically caches block-wise features based on their similarity
across adjacent timesteps. By ranking the evolution of residuals, Sortblock
adaptively determines a recomputation ratio, selectively skipping redundant
computations while preserving generation quality. Furthermore, we incorporate a
lightweight linear prediction mechanism to reduce accumulated errors in skipped
blocks.Extensive experiments across various tasks and DiT architectures
demonstrate that Sortblock achieves over 2$\times$ inference speedup with
minimal degradation in output quality, offering an effective and generalizable
solution for accelerating diffusion-based generative models.

TL;DR: DC-AE 1.5是一种新型深度压缩自编码器家族，通过结构化潜在空间和增强扩散训练策略，解决了高分辨率扩散模型中潜在通道增加导致的收敛慢问题，提升了生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率扩散模型中，增加自编码器的潜在通道数虽能提升重建质量，但会导致扩散模型收敛变慢，限制了潜在扩散模型的质量上限。

Method: 提出两种创新：1) 结构化潜在空间，通过训练在潜在空间中引入通道级结构；2) 增强扩散训练策略，通过额外扩散训练目标加速收敛。

Result: DC-AE 1.5在ImageNet 512x512上比DC-AE-f32c32生成质量更好且速度快4倍。

Conclusion: DC-AE 1.5通过结构化潜在空间和增强训练策略，显著提升了高分辨率扩散模型的性能和效率。

Abstract: We present DC-AE 1.5, a new family of deep compression autoencoders for
high-resolution diffusion models. Increasing the autoencoder's latent channel
number is a highly effective approach for improving its reconstruction quality.
However, it results in slow convergence for diffusion models, leading to poorer
generation quality despite better reconstruction quality. This issue limits the
quality upper bound of latent diffusion models and hinders the employment of
autoencoders with higher spatial compression ratios. We introduce two key
innovations to address this challenge: i) Structured Latent Space, a
training-based approach to impose a desired channel-wise structure on the
latent space with front latent channels capturing object structures and latter
latent channels capturing image details; ii) Augmented Diffusion Training, an
augmented diffusion training strategy with additional diffusion training
objectives on object latent channels to accelerate convergence. With these
techniques, DC-AE 1.5 delivers faster convergence and better diffusion scaling
results than DC-AE. On ImageNet 512x512, DC-AE-1.5-f64c128 delivers better
image generation quality than DC-AE-f32c32 while being 4x faster. Code:

Conclusion: 本文为第一人称视频理解提供了关键资源和见解，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal video grounding aims to localize target entities in videos
based on textual queries. While existing research has made significant progress
in exocentric videos, the egocentric setting remains relatively underexplored,
despite its growing importance in applications such as augmented reality and
robotics. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of the discrepancies
between egocentric and exocentric videos, revealing key challenges such as
shorter object durations, sparser trajectories, smaller object sizes, and
larger positional shifts. To address these challenges, we introduce EgoMask,
the first pixel-level benchmark for fine-grained spatiotemporal grounding in
egocentric videos. It is constructed by our proposed automatic annotation
pipeline, which annotates referring expressions and object masks across short-,
medium-, and long-term videos. Additionally, we create EgoMask-Train, a
large-scale training dataset to facilitate model development. Experiments
demonstrate that the state-of-the-art spatiotemporal grounding models perform
poorly on our benchmark EgoMask, but fine-tuning on EgoMask-Train yields
significant improvements, while preserving performance on exocentric datasets.
Our work thus provides essential resources and insights for advancing
egocentric video understanding. Our code is available at

Abstract: Video outpainting presents a unique challenge of extending the borders while
maintaining consistency with the given content. In this paper, we suggest the
use of video inpainting models that excel in object flow learning and
reconstruction in outpainting rather than solely generating the background as
in existing methods. However, directly applying or fine-tuning inpainting
models to outpainting has shown to be ineffective, often leading to blurry
results. Our extensive experiments on discriminator designs reveal that a
critical component missing in the outpainting fine-tuning process is a
discriminator capable of effectively assessing the perceptual quality of the
extended areas. To tackle this limitation, we differentiate the objectives of
adversarial training into global and local goals and introduce a hierarchical
discriminator that meets both objectives. Additionally, we develop a
specialized outpainting loss function that leverages both local and global
features of the discriminator. Fine-tuning on this adversarial loss function
enhances the generator's ability to produce both visually appealing and
globally coherent outpainted scenes. Our proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Supplementary
materials including the demo video and the code are available in SigPort.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于上下文感知的运动检索框架，用于自动驾驶系统中罕见人类行为的检索，并在WayMoCo数据集上验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统需在涉及脆弱道路使用者（VRUs）的复杂行为场景中可靠运行，但大规模数据集中罕见行为的检索具有挑战性。

Method: 结合SMPL运动序列和视频帧，编码到与自然语言对齐的多模态嵌入空间，支持通过文本查询检索人类行为及其上下文。

Result: 在WayMoCo数据集上，该方法在运动-上下文检索任务中比现有最优模型准确率提升27.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动驾驶系统提供了高效的人类行为检索工具，WayMoCo数据集为相关研究提供了新资源。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems must operate reliably in safety-critical
scenarios, particularly those involving unusual or complex behavior by
Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs). Identifying these edge cases in driving datasets
is essential for robust evaluation and generalization, but retrieving such rare
human behavior scenarios within the long tail of large-scale datasets is
challenging. To support targeted evaluation of autonomous driving systems in
diverse, human-centered scenarios, we propose a novel context-aware motion
retrieval framework. Our method combines Skinned Multi-Person Linear
(SMPL)-based motion sequences and corresponding video frames before encoding
them into a shared multimodal embedding space aligned with natural language.
Our approach enables the scalable retrieval of human behavior and their context
through text queries. This work also introduces our dataset WayMoCo, an
extension of the Waymo Open Dataset. It contains automatically labeled motion
and scene context descriptions derived from generated pseudo-ground-truth SMPL
sequences and corresponding image data. Our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models by up to 27.5% accuracy in motion-context retrieval,
when evaluated on the WayMoCo dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Mamba的水下实例分割模型UIS-Mamba，通过动态树扫描（DTS）和隐藏状态弱化（HSW）模块解决水下场景的特殊挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下实例分割任务因水下场景的特殊性（如颜色失真和模糊边界）面临挑战，现有方法难以保持实例内部连续性。

Method: 设计了DTS模块（动态调整补丁偏移和缩放）和HSW模块（基于Ncut的隐藏状态弱化机制）以优化Mamba模型。

Result: 在UIIS和USIS10K数据集上实现了最先进的性能，同时保持低参数和计算复杂度。

Conclusion: UIS-Mamba成功将Mamba迁移至水下任务，解决了实例连续性和背景干扰问题。

Abstract: Underwater Instance Segmentation (UIS) tasks are crucial for underwater
complex scene detection. Mamba, as an emerging state space model with
inherently linear complexity and global receptive fields, is highly suitable
for processing image segmentation tasks with long sequence features. However,
due to the particularity of underwater scenes, there are many challenges in
applying Mamba to UIS. The existing fixed-patch scanning mechanism cannot
maintain the internal continuity of scanned instances in the presence of
severely underwater color distortion and blurred instance boundaries, and the
hidden state of the complex underwater background can also inhibit the
understanding of instance objects. In this work, we propose the first
Mamba-based underwater instance segmentation model UIS-Mamba, and design two
innovative modules, Dynamic Tree Scan (DTS) and Hidden State Weaken (HSW), to
migrate Mamba to the underwater task. DTS module maintains the continuity of
the internal features of the instance objects by allowing the patches to
dynamically offset and scale, thereby guiding the minimum spanning tree and
providing dynamic local receptive fields. HSW module suppresses the
interference of complex backgrounds and effectively focuses the information
flow of state propagation to the instances themselves through the Ncut-based
hidden state weakening mechanism. Experimental results show that UIS-Mamba
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both UIIS and USIS10K datasets, while
maintaining a low number of parameters and computational complexity. Code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合物理先验知识和多区域修复技术的新方法，用于动态场景中遮挡物体的完整推断，显著提升了人机交互（HOI）场景中的生成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如预训练扩散模型）在动态场景中因对人机交互理解有限，难以生成合理的完整推断。

Method: 利用人类拓扑和接触信息的物理约束，定义主次区域，并在扩散模型中采用定制去噪策略的多区域修复技术。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在HOI场景中显著优于现有方法，且无需真实接触标注仍具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了动态环境中机器感知的类人理解能力，适用于3D重建和新视角/姿态合成等任务。

Abstract: Amodal completion, which is the process of inferring the full appearance of
objects despite partial occlusions, is crucial for understanding complex
human-object interactions (HOI) in computer vision and robotics. Existing
methods, such as those that use pre-trained diffusion models, often struggle to
generate plausible completions in dynamic scenarios because they have a limited
understanding of HOI. To solve this problem, we've developed a new approach
that uses physical prior knowledge along with a specialized multi-regional
inpainting technique designed for HOI. By incorporating physical constraints
from human topology and contact information, we define two distinct regions:
the primary region, where occluded object parts are most likely to be, and the
secondary region, where occlusions are less probable. Our multi-regional
inpainting method uses customized denoising strategies across these regions
within a diffusion model. This improves the accuracy and realism of the
generated completions in both their shape and visual detail. Our experimental
results show that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in
HOI scenarios, moving machine perception closer to a more human-like
understanding of dynamic environments. We also show that our pipeline is robust
even without ground-truth contact annotations, which broadens its applicability
to tasks like 3D reconstruction and novel view/pose synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出AerialCSP虚拟数据集，用于模拟CSP电站的航拍图像，减少真实数据标注需求，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CSP电站的航拍图像具有高反射性和领域特殊性，通用数据集训练的模型难以直接应用，且真实数据标注成本高。

Method: 创建AerialCSP合成数据集，模拟真实CSP电站图像，用于预训练模型，并评估其性能。

Result: AerialCSP显著提升模型在真实CSP电站中的缺陷检测能力，尤其是罕见和小缺陷。

Conclusion: AerialCSP为CSP相关视觉任务提供了高质量合成数据，减少了对真实标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: In the context of Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants, aerial images
captured by drones present a unique set of challenges. Unlike urban or natural
landscapes commonly found in existing datasets, solar fields contain highly
reflective surfaces, and domain-specific elements that are uncommon in
traditional computer vision benchmarks. As a result, machine learning models
trained on generic datasets struggle to generalize to this setting without
extensive retraining and large volumes of annotated data. However, collecting
and labeling such data is costly and time-consuming, making it impractical for
rapid deployment in industrial applications.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel approach: the creation of
AerialCSP, a virtual dataset that simulates aerial imagery of CSP plants. By
generating synthetic data that closely mimic real-world conditions, our
objective is to facilitate pretraining of models before deployment,
significantly reducing the need for extensive manual labeling. Our main
contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce AerialCSP, a high-quality
synthetic dataset for aerial inspection of CSP plants, providing annotated data
for object detection and image segmentation; (2) we benchmark multiple models
on AerialCSP, establishing a baseline for CSP-related vision tasks; and (3) we
demonstrate that pretraining on AerialCSP significantly improves real-world
fault detection, particularly for rare and small defects, reducing the need for
extensive manual labeling. AerialCSP is made publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对管状结构分割（TSS）的测试时自适应框架TopoTTA，通过两阶段方法解决领域偏移问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TSS对领域偏移特别敏感，传统方法难以应对拓扑结构变化和局部特征差异，导致性能下降。

Method: TopoTTA包含两阶段：1）使用TopoMDCs适应跨域拓扑差异；2）通过TopoHG策略和伪标签优化拓扑连续性。

Result: 在四个场景和十个数据集上平均提升了31.81%的clDice指标。

Conclusion: TopoTTA是一种即插即用的解决方案，能有效处理TSS中的拓扑分布偏移。

Abstract: Tubular structure segmentation (TSS) is important for various applications,
such as hemodynamic analysis and route navigation. Despite significant progress
in TSS, domain shifts remain a major challenge, leading to performance
degradation in unseen target domains. Unlike other segmentation tasks, TSS is
more sensitive to domain shifts, as changes in topological structures can
compromise segmentation integrity, and variations in local features
distinguishing foreground from background (e.g., texture and contrast) may
further disrupt topological continuity. To address these challenges, we propose
Topology-enhanced Test-Time Adaptation (TopoTTA), the first test-time
adaptation framework designed specifically for TSS. TopoTTA consists of two
stages: Stage 1 adapts models to cross-domain topological discrepancies using
the proposed Topological Meta Difference Convolutions (TopoMDCs), which enhance
topological representation without altering pre-trained parameters; Stage 2
improves topological continuity by a novel Topology Hard sample Generation
(TopoHG) strategy and prediction alignment on hard samples with pseudo-labels
in the generated pseudo-break regions. Extensive experiments across four
scenarios and ten datasets demonstrate TopoTTA's effectiveness in handling
topological distribution shifts, achieving an average improvement of 31.81% in
clDice. TopoTTA also serves as a plug-and-play TTA solution for CNN-based TSS
models.

Motivation: 现有交互式抠图方法在提取边缘细节方面表现不足，而扩散模型因其强大的数据分布建模和纹理细节合成能力，成为改进交互式抠图的理想选择。

Method: SDMatte利用扩散模型的先验知识，将文本驱动交互能力转化为视觉提示驱动交互能力，并引入坐标和透明度嵌入以及掩码自注意力机制。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，SDMatte在交互式抠图中表现出色，尤其在边缘细节提取方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SDMatte通过扩散模型和视觉提示驱动的交互方式，显著提升了交互式抠图的性能，为精细边缘处理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent interactive matting methods have shown satisfactory performance in
capturing the primary regions of objects, but they fall short in extracting
fine-grained details in edge regions. Diffusion models trained on billions of
image-text pairs, demonstrate exceptional capability in modeling highly complex
data distributions and synthesizing realistic texture details, while exhibiting
robust text-driven interaction capabilities, making them an attractive solution
for interactive matting. To this end, we propose SDMatte, a diffusion-driven
interactive matting model, with three key contributions. First, we exploit the
powerful priors of diffusion models and transform the text-driven interaction
capability into visual prompt-driven interaction capability to enable
interactive matting. Second, we integrate coordinate embeddings of visual
prompts and opacity embeddings of target objects into U-Net, enhancing
SDMatte's sensitivity to spatial position information and opacity information.
Third, we propose a masked self-attention mechanism that enables the model to
focus on areas specified by visual prompts, leading to better performance.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superior performance
of our method, validating its effectiveness in interactive matting. Our code
and model are available at https://github.com/vivoCameraResearch/SDMatte.

TL;DR: AutoDebias是一个自动识别并减少文本到图像（T2I）模型中社会偏见的框架，无需预先知道具体偏见类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T2I模型在生成高质量图像时可能表现出未提及的社会偏见（如性别或种族刻板印象），现有方法难以处理复杂或重叠的偏见。

Method: AutoDebias利用视觉语言模型检测偏见模式，生成包容性替代提示，并通过CLIP引导的训练过程减少偏见。

Result: 在25种偏见场景中，AutoDebias检测偏见准确率达91.6%，将偏见输出从90%降至可忽略水平，同时保持图像质量。

Conclusion: AutoDebias能有效处理复杂偏见，同时保持模型性能，为T2I模型的公平性提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models generate high-quality images from text prompts but
often exhibit unintended social biases, such as gender or racial stereotypes,
even when these attributes are not mentioned. Existing debiasing methods work
well for simple or well-known cases but struggle with subtle or overlapping
biases. We propose AutoDebias, a framework that automatically identifies and
mitigates harmful biases in T2I models without prior knowledge of specific bias
types. Specifically, AutoDebias leverages vision-language models to detect
biased visual patterns and constructs fairness guides by generating inclusive
alternative prompts that reflect balanced representations. These guides drive a
CLIP-guided training process that promotes fairer outputs while preserving the
original model's image quality and diversity. Unlike existing methods,
AutoDebias effectively addresses both subtle stereotypes and multiple
interacting biases. We evaluate the framework on a benchmark covering over 25
bias scenarios, including challenging cases where multiple biases occur
simultaneously. AutoDebias detects harmful patterns with 91.6% accuracy and
reduces biased outputs from 90% to negligible levels, while preserving the
visual fidelity of the original model.

Motivation: 理解生物生长的时间动态在微生物学、农业和生物降解研究中至关重要，但现有视觉语言模型在捕捉时间进展方面效果有限。

Method: 提出CLIPTime框架，结合视觉-文本嵌入学习，通过分类和回归任务预测离散生长阶段和连续时间戳，并引入合成真菌生长数据集进行训练和评估。

Result: 实验表明，CLIPTime能有效建模生物进展，生成可解释且时间准确的结果。

Conclusion: CLIPTime展示了视觉语言模型在现实生物监测应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Understanding the temporal dynamics of biological growth is critical across
diverse fields such as microbiology, agriculture, and biodegradation research.
Although vision-language models like Contrastive Language Image Pretraining
(CLIP) have shown strong capabilities in joint visual-textual reasoning, their
effectiveness in capturing temporal progression remains limited. To address
this, we propose CLIPTime, a multimodal, multitask framework designed to
predict both the developmental stage and the corresponding timestamp of fungal
growth from image and text inputs. Built upon the CLIP architecture, our model
learns joint visual-textual embeddings and enables time-aware inference without
requiring explicit temporal input during testing. To facilitate training and
evaluation, we introduce a synthetic fungal growth dataset annotated with
aligned timestamps and categorical stage labels. CLIPTime jointly performs
classification and regression, predicting discrete growth stages alongside
continuous timestamps. We also propose custom evaluation metrics, including
temporal accuracy and regression error, to assess the precision of time-aware
predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that CLIPTime effectively models
biological progression and produces interpretable, temporally grounded outputs,
highlighting the potential of vision-language models in real-world biological
monitoring applications.

Motivation: 多光谱和高光谱图像融合（MHIF）任务由于光谱和空间信息的固有权衡以及观测数据的有限性，本质上是不适定的，现有方法未能有效解决数据不对齐问题。

Method: 提出PIF-Net框架，结合不适定先验和可逆Mamba架构，设计Fusion-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation模块动态校准特征。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，PIF-Net的图像恢复性能显著优于现有方法，同时保持模型高效。

Conclusion: PIF-Net通过创新的架构和模块设计，成功解决了MHIF任务中的不适定问题，为图像融合领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: The goal of multispectral and hyperspectral image fusion (MHIF) is to
generate high-quality images that simultaneously possess rich spectral
information and fine spatial details. However, due to the inherent trade-off
between spectral and spatial information and the limited availability of
observations, this task is fundamentally ill-posed. Previous studies have not
effectively addressed the ill-posed nature caused by data misalignment. To
tackle this challenge, we propose a fusion framework named PIF-Net, which
explicitly incorporates ill-posed priors to effectively fuse multispectral
images and hyperspectral images. To balance global spectral modeling with
computational efficiency, we design a method based on an invertible Mamba
architecture that maintains information consistency during feature
transformation and fusion, ensuring stable gradient flow and process
reversibility. Furthermore, we introduce a novel fusion module called the
Fusion-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation module, which dynamically calibrates spectral
and spatial features while keeping the model lightweight. Extensive experiments
on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that PIF-Net achieves significantly
better image restoration performance than current state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining model efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video super-resolution (VSR) models have demonstrated
impressive results in enhancing low-resolution videos. However, due to
limitations in adequately controlling the generation process, achieving high
fidelity alignment with the low-resolution input while maintaining temporal
consistency across frames remains a significant challenge. In this work, we
propose Semantic and Temporal Guided Video Super-Resolution (SeTe-VSR), a novel
approach that incorporates both semantic and temporal-spatio guidance in the
latent diffusion space to address these challenges. By incorporating high-level
semantic information and integrating spatial and temporal information, our
approach achieves a seamless balance between recovering intricate details and
ensuring temporal coherence. Our method not only preserves high-reality visual

demonstrate that SeTe-VSR outperforms existing methods in terms of detail
recovery and perceptual quality, highlighting its effectiveness for complex

Conclusion: HyPCV-Former在异常检测任务中表现出色，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection is a fundamental task in video surveillance, with
broad applications in public safety and intelligent monitoring systems.
Although previous methods leverage Euclidean representations in RGB or depth
domains, such embeddings are inherently limited in capturing hierarchical event
structures and spatio-temporal continuity. To address these limitations, we
propose HyPCV-Former, a novel hyperbolic spatio-temporal transformer for
anomaly detection in 3D point cloud videos. Our approach first extracts
per-frame spatial features from point cloud sequences via point cloud
extractor, and then embeds them into Lorentzian hyperbolic space, which better
captures the latent hierarchical structure of events. To model temporal
dynamics, we introduce a hyperbolic multi-head self-attention (HMHA) mechanism
that leverages Lorentzian inner products and curvature-aware softmax to learn
temporal dependencies under non-Euclidean geometry. Our method performs all
feature transformations and anomaly scoring directly within full Lorentzian
space rather than via tangent space approximation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HyPCV-Former achieves state-of-the-art performance across
multiple anomaly categories, with a 7\% improvement on the TIMo dataset and a
5.6\% gain on the DAD dataset compared to benchmarks. The code will be released
upon paper acceptance.

Conclusion: LAMIC为可控多图像合成提供了无需训练的新范式，具有强大的性能扩展潜力。

Abstract: In controllable image synthesis, generating coherent and consistent images
from multiple references with spatial layout awareness remains an open
challenge. We present LAMIC, a Layout-Aware Multi-Image Composition framework
that, for the first time, extends single-reference diffusion models to
multi-reference scenarios in a training-free manner. Built upon the MMDiT
model, LAMIC introduces two plug-and-play attention mechanisms: 1) Group
Isolation Attention (GIA) to enhance entity disentanglement; and 2)
Region-Modulated Attention (RMA) to enable layout-aware generation. To
comprehensively evaluate model capabilities, we further introduce three
metrics: 1) Inclusion Ratio (IN-R) and Fill Ratio (FI-R) for assessing layout
control; and 2) Background Similarity (BG-S) for measuring background
consistency. Extensive experiments show that LAMIC achieves state-of-the-art
performance across most major metrics: it consistently outperforms existing
multi-reference baselines in ID-S, BG-S, IN-R and AVG scores across all
settings, and achieves the best DPG in complex composition tasks. These results
demonstrate LAMIC's superior abilities in identity keeping, background
preservation, layout control, and prompt-following, all achieved without any
training or fine-tuning, showcasing strong zero-shot generalization ability. By
inheriting the strengths of advanced single-reference models and enabling
seamless extension to multi-image scenarios, LAMIC establishes a new
training-free paradigm for controllable multi-image composition. As foundation
models continue to evolve, LAMIC's performance is expected to scale
accordingly. Our implementation is available at:

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法主要针对大病灶，忽略了纵向和临床信息，而早期癌症检测需要这些信息。

Result: 在内部纵向数据集上，Dice分数比现有方法提升5%，TPA和BCR均贡献互补性能增益。

Conclusion: 结合时间和临床背景对乳腺癌筛查中的早期病灶分割至关重要。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of small lesions in Breast Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced
MRI (DCE-MRI) is critical for early cancer detection, especially in high-risk
patients. While recent deep learning methods have advanced lesion segmentation,
they primarily target large lesions and neglect valuable longitudinal and
clinical information routinely used by radiologists. In real-world screening,
detecting subtle or emerging lesions requires radiologists to compare across
timepoints and consider previous radiology assessments, such as the BI-RADS
score. We propose LesiOnTime, a novel 3D segmentation approach that mimics
clinical diagnostic workflows by jointly leveraging longitudinal imaging and
BIRADS scores. The key components are: (1) a Temporal Prior Attention (TPA)
block that dynamically integrates information from previous and current scans;
and (2) a BI-RADS Consistency Regularization (BCR) loss that enforces latent
space alignment for scans with similar radiological assessments, thus embedding
domain knowledge into the training process. Evaluated on a curated in-house

Conclusion: 提出的无监督标注方法有效解决了遥感图像标注的局限性，提高了标注的准确性和灵活性。

Abstract: Machine learning for remote sensing imaging relies on up-to-date and accurate
labels for model training and testing. Labelling remote sensing imagery is time
and cost intensive, requiring expert analysis. Previous labelling tools rely on
pre-labelled data for training in order to label new unseen data. In this work,
we define an unsupervised pipeline for finding and labelling geographical areas
of similar context and content within Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Our
approach removes limitations of previous methods by utilising segmentation with
convolutional and graph neural networks to encode a more robust feature space
for image comparison. Unlike previous approaches we segment the image into
homogeneous regions of pixels that are grouped based on colour and spatial
similarity. Graph neural networks are used to aggregate information about the
surrounding segments enabling the feature representation to encode the local
neighbourhood whilst preserving its own local information. This reduces
outliers in the labelling tool, allows users to label at a granular level, and
allows a rotationally invariant semantic relationship at the image level to be
formed within the encoding space.

TL;DR: EPANet是一种高效的水下鱼类检测网络，通过互补特征整合和轻量化设计，解决了现有方法在复杂性和效率上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下鱼类检测因低分辨率、背景干扰和目标与环境的视觉相似性而具有挑战性，现有方法常因复杂性和效率问题受限。

Method: EPANet包含EPA-FPN和MS-DDSP瓶颈模块，前者通过长距离跳跃连接和多尺度融合提升特征整合效率，后者通过细粒度特征分割和多样化卷积增强局部特征多样性。

Result: 在基准数据集上，EPANet在检测精度和推理速度上优于现有方法，同时保持较低的参数复杂度。

Conclusion: EPANet为水下鱼类检测提供了一种高效且轻量化的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Underwater fish detection (UFD) remains a challenging task in computer vision
due to low object resolution, significant background interference, and high
visual similarity between targets and surroundings. Existing approaches
primarily focus on local feature enhancement or incorporate complex attention
mechanisms to highlight small objects, often at the cost of increased model
complexity and reduced efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose an
efficient path aggregation network (EPANet), which leverages complementary
feature integration to achieve accurate and lightweight UFD. EPANet consists of
two key components: an efficient path aggregation feature pyramid network
(EPA-FPN) and a multi-scale diverse-division short path bottleneck (MS-DDSP
bottleneck). The EPA-FPN introduces long-range skip connections across
disparate scales to improve semantic-spatial complementarity, while cross-layer
fusion paths are adopted to enhance feature integration efficiency. The MS-DDSP
bottleneck extends the conventional bottleneck structure by introducing
finer-grained feature division and diverse convolutional operations, thereby
increasing local feature diversity and representation capacity. Extensive
experiments on benchmark UFD datasets demonstrate that EPANet outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and inference speed,
while maintaining comparable or even lower parameter complexity.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于参考的视频色彩分级框架，通过扩散模型生成查找表（LUT）实现色彩属性对齐，支持用户通过文本提示调整低层特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频色彩分级通常需要专业技能，本文旨在简化这一过程，使其更易用且高效。

Method: 使用扩散模型生成LUT，对齐参考场景与输入视频的色彩属性，并通过文本提示增强低层特征。

Result: 实验和用户研究表明，该方法能有效进行视频色彩分级，且保持结构细节和快速推理。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为视频色彩分级提供了一种高效且用户友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Different from color correction and transfer, color grading involves
adjusting colors for artistic or storytelling purposes in a video, which is
used to establish a specific look or mood. However, due to the complexity of
the process and the need for specialized editing skills, video color grading
remains primarily the domain of professional colorists. In this paper, we
present a reference-based video color grading framework. Our key idea is
explicitly generating a look-up table (LUT) for color attribute alignment
between reference scenes and input video via a diffusion model. As a training
objective, we enforce that high-level features of the reference scenes like
look, mood, and emotion should be similar to that of the input video. Our
LUT-based approach allows for color grading without any loss of structural
details in the whole video frames as well as achieving fast inference. We
further build a pipeline to incorporate a user-preference via text prompts for
low-level feature enhancement such as contrast and brightness, etc.
Experimental results, including extensive user studies, demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach for video color grading. Codes are publicly
available at https://github.com/seunghyuns98/VideoColorGrading.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了视觉语言模型（VLMs）在医学图像中定位解剖结构相对位置的能力不足，并提出了一种新的基准数据集MIRP以推动研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策依赖于解剖结构和异常的相对位置，但现有VLMs在此任务上表现不佳，亟需改进。

Method: 评估了GPT-4o、Llama3.2等VLMs的表现，并尝试通过视觉提示（如标记）提升性能。

Result: VLMs在医学图像上的表现显著低于自然图像，且依赖先验知识而非图像内容。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究VLMs在医学图像中的定位能力，MIRP数据集为此提供了工具。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making relies heavily on understanding relative positions
of anatomical structures and anomalies. Therefore, for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) to be applicable in clinical practice, the ability to accurately
determine relative positions on medical images is a fundamental prerequisite.
Despite its importance, this capability remains highly underexplored. To
address this gap, we evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art VLMs, GPT-4o,
Llama3.2, Pixtral, and JanusPro, and find that all models fail at this
fundamental task. Inspired by successful approaches in computer vision, we
investigate whether visual prompts, such as alphanumeric or colored markers
placed on anatomical structures, can enhance performance. While these markers
provide moderate improvements, results remain significantly lower on medical
images compared to observations made on natural images. Our evaluations suggest
that, in medical imaging, VLMs rely more on prior anatomical knowledge than on
actual image content for answering relative position questions, often leading
to incorrect conclusions. To facilitate further research in this area, we
introduce the MIRP , Medical Imaging Relative Positioning, benchmark dataset,
designed to systematically evaluate the capability to identify relative
positions in medical images.

Motivation: 深度神经网络易受对抗扰动影响，现有扩散净化方法因迭代去噪效率低而难以实用。

Method: 提出噪声桥蒸馏目标，在潜在一致性模型中建立对抗噪声与干净数据的对齐，并结合多尺度边缘图增强语义。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现SOTA鲁棒精度和图像质量，推理时间约0.2秒。

Conclusion: DBLP为实时对抗净化迈出重要一步。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep neural networks (DNNs) have led to remarkable success
across a wide range of tasks. However, their susceptibility to adversarial
perturbations remains a critical vulnerability. Existing diffusion-based
adversarial purification methods often require intensive iterative denoising,
severely limiting their practical deployment. In this paper, we propose
Diffusion Bridge Distillation for Purification (DBLP), a novel and efficient
diffusion-based framework for adversarial purification. Central to our approach
is a new objective, noise bridge distillation, which constructs a principled
alignment between the adversarial noise distribution and the clean data
distribution within a latent consistency model (LCM). To further enhance
semantic fidelity, we introduce adaptive semantic enhancement, which fuses
multi-scale pyramid edge maps as conditioning input to guide the purification
process. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that DBLP
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) robust accuracy, superior image quality, and
around 0.2s inference time, marking a significant step toward real-time
adversarial purification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiPrune是一种无需训练、模型无关的视觉令牌剪枝框架，利用视觉编码器的分层注意力结构，显著提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）中冗长的视觉令牌序列导致计算开销大、推理效率低，现有方法依赖特殊令牌或任务特定训练，限制了可扩展性。

Method: HiPrune通过分层注意力结构选择三类信息令牌：锚点令牌（对象中心层高注意力）、缓冲令牌（空间连续性）和注册令牌（全局上下文层强注意力）。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5等模型上，HiPrune仅用33.3%令牌保留99.3%任务准确率，减少推理FLOPs和延迟高达9倍。

Conclusion: HiPrune无需训练，适用于任何ViT-based VLM，在性能和效率上均表现出色。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) encode images into lengthy sequences of visual
tokens, leading to excessive computational overhead and limited inference
efficiency. While prior efforts prune or merge tokens to address this issue,
they often rely on special tokens (e.g., CLS) or require task-specific
training, hindering scalability across architectures. In this paper, we propose
HiPrune, a training-free and model-agnostic token Pruning framework that
exploits the Hierarchical attention structure within vision encoders. We
identify that middle layers attend to object-centric regions, while deep layers
capture global contextual features. Based on this observation, HiPrune selects
three types of informative tokens: (1) Anchor tokens with high attention in
object-centric layers, (2) Buffer tokens adjacent to anchors for spatial
continuity, and (3) Register tokens with strong attention in deep layers for
global summarization. Our method requires no retraining and integrates
seamlessly with any ViT-based VLM. Extensive experiments on LLaVA-1.5,
LLaVA-NeXT, and Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate that HiPrune achieves state-of-the-art
pruning performance, preserving up to 99.3% task accuracy with only 33.3%
tokens, and maintaining 99.5% accuracy with just 11.1% tokens. Meanwhile, it
reduces inference FLOPs and latency by up to 9$\times$, showcasing strong
generalization across models and tasks. Code is available at

Result: 在八个基准测试中，FreeCP作为即插即用模块显著提升了分割性能。

Conclusion: FreeCP有效解决了开放词汇语义分割中的关键挑战，提升了性能。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained vision-language models has emerged as a powerful
approach for enhancing open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS). However,
the substantial computational and resource demands associated with training on
large datasets have prompted interest in training-free methods for OVSS.
Existing training-free approaches primarily focus on modifying model
architectures and generating prototypes to improve segmentation performance.
However, they often neglect the challenges posed by class redundancy, where
multiple categories are not present in the current test image, and
visual-language ambiguity, where semantic similarities among categories create
confusion in class activation. These issues can lead to suboptimal class
activation maps and affinity-refined activation maps. Motivated by these
observations, we propose FreeCP, a novel training-free class purification
framework designed to address these challenges. FreeCP focuses on purifying
semantic categories and rectifying errors caused by redundancy and ambiguity.
The purified class representations are then leveraged to produce final
segmentation predictions. We conduct extensive experiments across eight
benchmarks to validate FreeCP's effectiveness. Results demonstrate that FreeCP,
as a plug-and-play module, significantly boosts segmentation performance when
combined with other OVSS methods.

Result: 在PartNet-Mobility数据集上验证，PhysNAP在约束一致性和生成能力之间取得了平衡，优于无指导的基线模型。

Conclusion: PhysNAP通过物理约束和类别信息显著提升了铰接物体生成的物理合理性和对齐效果。

Abstract: Articulated objects are an important type of interactable objects in everyday
environments. In this paper, we propose PhysNAP, a novel diffusion model-based
approach for generating articulated objects that aligns them with partial point
clouds and improves their physical plausibility. The model represents part
shapes by signed distance functions (SDFs). We guide the reverse diffusion
process using a point cloud alignment loss computed using the predicted SDFs.
Additionally, we impose non-penetration and mobility constraints based on the
part SDFs for guiding the model to generate more physically plausible objects.
We also make our diffusion approach category-aware to further improve point
cloud alignment if category information is available. We evaluate the
generative ability and constraint consistency of samples generated with PhysNAP
using the PartNet-Mobility dataset. We also compare it with an unguided
baseline diffusion model and demonstrate that PhysNAP can improve constraint
consistency and provides a tradeoff with generative ability.

Result: 伪标签更易获取，性能优于其他弱标注方法，甚至在标注时间有限时优于真实标注。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低标注成本，提升检测性能，适用于标注资源有限的场景。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art methods for object detection rely on annotated
bounding boxes of large data sets for training. However, obtaining such
annotations is expensive and can require up to hundreds of hours of manual
labor. This poses a challenge, especially since such annotations can only be
provided by experts, as they require knowledge about the scientific domain. To
tackle this challenge, we propose a domain-specific weakly supervised object
detection algorithm that only relies on image-level annotations, which are
significantly easier to acquire. Our method distills the knowledge of a
pre-trained model, on the task of predicting the presence or absence of a virus
in an image, to obtain a set of pseudo-labels that can be used to later train a
state-of-the-art object detection model. To do so, we use an optimization
approach with a shrinking receptive field to extract virus particles directly
without specific network architectures. Through a set of extensive studies, we
show how the proposed pseudo-labels are easier to obtain, and, more
importantly, are able to outperform other existing weak labeling methods, and
even ground truth labels, in cases where the time to obtain the annotation is
limited.

Motivation: 动态物体破坏了静态场景假设，导致传统无监督视觉里程计方法在动态场景中表现不佳。

Method: 结合目标帧和参考帧的不确定性，提出CoProU-VO方法，基于视觉Transformer同时学习深度、不确定性估计和相机位姿。

Result: 在KITTI和nuScenes数据集上表现优于现有方法，尤其在高速公路场景中效果显著。

Conclusion: 跨帧不确定性传播是提升动态场景下视觉里程计性能的关键。

Abstract: Visual Odometry (VO) is fundamental to autonomous navigation, robotics, and
augmented reality, with unsupervised approaches eliminating the need for
expensive ground-truth labels. However, these methods struggle when dynamic
objects violate the static scene assumption, leading to erroneous pose
estimations. We tackle this problem by uncertainty modeling, which is a
commonly used technique that creates robust masks to filter out dynamic objects
and occlusions without requiring explicit motion segmentation. Traditional
uncertainty modeling considers only single-frame information, overlooking the
uncertainties across consecutive frames. Our key insight is that uncertainty
must be propagated and combined across temporal frames to effectively identify
unreliable regions, particularly in dynamic scenes. To address this challenge,
we introduce Combined Projected Uncertainty VO (CoProU-VO), a novel end-to-end
approach that combines target frame uncertainty with projected reference frame
uncertainty using a principled probabilistic formulation. Built upon vision
transformer backbones, our model simultaneously learns depth, uncertainty
estimation, and camera poses. Consequently, experiments on the KITTI and
nuScenes datasets demonstrate significant improvements over previous
unsupervised monocular end-to-end two-frame-based methods and exhibit strong
performance in challenging highway scenes where other approaches often fail.
Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of
cross-frame uncertainty propagation.

Conclusion: 通过不确定性建模，该方法有效提升了未知物体检测的准确性，且计算高效。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation models trained on known object classes often fail in
real-world autonomous driving scenarios by confidently misclassifying unknown
objects. While pixel-wise out-of-distribution detection can identify unknown
objects, existing methods struggle in complex scenes where rare object classes
are often confused with truly unknown objects. We introduce an
uncertainty-aware likelihood ratio estimation method that addresses these
limitations. Our approach uses an evidential classifier within a likelihood
ratio test to distinguish between known and unknown pixel features from a
semantic segmentation model, while explicitly accounting for uncertainty.
Instead of producing point estimates, our method outputs probability
distributions that capture uncertainty from both rare training examples and
imperfect synthetic outliers. We show that by incorporating uncertainty in this
way, outlier exposure can be leveraged more effectively. Evaluated on five
standard benchmark datasets, our method achieves the lowest average false
positive rate (2.5%) among state-of-the-art while maintaining high average
precision (90.91%) and incurring only negligible computational overhead. Code

Motivation: NPP-VIIRS传感器的夜间灯光数据始于2012年，限制了长期时间序列研究，现有方法在光强度和结构细节上存在不足。

Method: 采用两阶段重建框架：构建阶段使用分层融合解码器（HFD）提升初始重建保真度，细化阶段利用双特征细化器（DFR）结合高分辨率不透水面掩膜增强结构细节。

Result: 开发的EVAL产品将中国夜间灯光数据扩展至1986年，R²从0.68提升至0.80，RMSE从1.27降至0.99，具有优异的时间一致性和社会经济参数相关性。

Conclusion: EVAL数据集为研究社区提供了高质量、长期的夜间灯光数据资源，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Artificial Night-Time Light (NTL) remote sensing is a vital proxy for
quantifying the intensity and spatial distribution of human activities.
Although the NPP-VIIRS sensor provides high-quality NTL observations, its
temporal coverage, which begins in 2012, restricts long-term time-series
studies that extend to earlier periods. Despite the progress in extending
VIIRS-like NTL time-series, current methods still suffer from two significant
shortcomings: the underestimation of light intensity and the structural
omission. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel reconstruction
framework consisting of a two-stage process: construction and refinement. The
construction stage features a Hierarchical Fusion Decoder (HFD) designed to
enhance the fidelity of the initial reconstruction. The refinement stage
employs a Dual Feature Refiner (DFR), which leverages high-resolution
impervious surface masks to guide and enhance fine-grained structural details.
Based on this framework, we developed the Extended VIIRS-like Artificial
Nighttime Light (EVAL) product for China, extending the standard data record
backwards by 26 years to begin in 1986. Quantitative evaluation shows that EVAL
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art products, boosting the
$\text{R}^2$ from 0.68 to 0.80 while lowering the RMSE from 1.27 to 0.99.
Furthermore, EVAL exhibits excellent temporal consistency and maintains a high
correlation with socioeconomic parameters, confirming its reliability for
long-term analysis. The resulting EVAL dataset provides a valuable new resource
for the research community and is publicly available at
https://doi.org/10.11888/HumanNat.tpdc.302930.

Motivation: 现有外部保护措施（文本过滤器和图像过滤器）存在局限性，无法高效且准确地检测T2I生成中的NSFW内容。

Method: 提出Wukong框架，利用扩散模型早期去噪步骤的中间输出和U-Net的跨注意力参数，实现早期检测。

Result: Wukong在性能上显著优于文本过滤器，与图像过滤器精度相当，但效率更高。

Conclusion: Wukong为T2I生成中的NSFW内容检测提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation is a popular AI-generated content (AIGC)
technology enabling diverse and creative image synthesis. However, some outputs
may contain Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content (e.g., violence), violating
community guidelines. Detecting NSFW content efficiently and accurately, known
as external safeguarding, is essential. Existing external safeguards fall into
two types: text filters, which analyze user prompts but overlook T2I
model-specific variations and are prone to adversarial attacks; and image
filters, which analyze final generated images but are computationally costly
and introduce latency. Diffusion models, the foundation of modern T2I systems
like Stable Diffusion, generate images through iterative denoising using a
U-Net architecture with ResNet and Transformer blocks. We observe that: (1)
early denoising steps define the semantic layout of the image, and (2)
cross-attention layers in U-Net are crucial for aligning text and image
regions. Based on these insights, we propose Wukong, a transformer-based NSFW
detection framework that leverages intermediate outputs from early denoising
steps and reuses U-Net's pre-trained cross-attention parameters. Wukong
operates within the diffusion process, enabling early detection without waiting
for full image generation. We also introduce a new dataset containing prompts,
seeds, and image-specific NSFW labels, and evaluate Wukong on this and two
public benchmarks. Results show that Wukong significantly outperforms
text-based safeguards and achieves comparable accuracy of image filters, while
offering much greater efficiency.

Result: GeoMoE在相对位姿和单应性估计上优于现有方法，并表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: GeoMoE通过简洁设计有效解决了异质运动场建模问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Recent progress in two-view geometry increasingly emphasizes enforcing
smoothness and global consistency priors when estimating motion fields between
pairs of images. However, in complex real-world scenes, characterized by
extreme viewpoint and scale changes as well as pronounced depth
discontinuities, the motion field often exhibits diverse and heterogeneous
motion patterns. Most existing methods lack targeted modeling strategies and
fail to explicitly account for this variability, resulting in estimated motion
fields that diverge from their true underlying structure and distribution. We
observe that Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) can assign dedicated experts to motion
sub-fields, enabling a divide-and-conquer strategy for heterogeneous motion
patterns. Building on this insight, we re-architect motion field modeling in
two-view geometry with GeoMoE, a streamlined framework. Specifically, we first
devise a Probabilistic Prior-Guided Decomposition strategy that exploits inlier
probability signals to perform a structure-aware decomposition of the motion
field into heterogeneous sub-fields, sharply curbing outlier-induced bias.
Next, we introduce an MoE-Enhanced Bi-Path Rectifier that enhances each
sub-field along spatial-context and channel-semantic paths and routes it to a
customized expert for targeted modeling, thereby decoupling heterogeneous
motion regimes, suppressing cross-sub-field interference and representational
entanglement, and yielding fine-grained motion-field rectification. With this
minimalist design, GeoMoE outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in
relative pose and homography estimation and shows strong generalization. The

Result: 在身体、手部、面部和全身姿态建模的多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DPoser-X为全身人体姿态先验建模设定了新标准。

Abstract: We present DPoser-X, a diffusion-based prior model for 3D whole-body human
poses. Building a versatile and robust full-body human pose prior remains
challenging due to the inherent complexity of articulated human poses and the
scarcity of high-quality whole-body pose datasets. To address these
limitations, we introduce a Diffusion model as body Pose prior (DPoser) and
extend it to DPoser-X for expressive whole-body human pose modeling. Our
approach unifies various pose-centric tasks as inverse problems, solving them
through variational diffusion sampling. To enhance performance on downstream
applications, we introduce a novel truncated timestep scheduling method
specifically designed for pose data characteristics. We also propose a masked
training mechanism that effectively combines whole-body and part-specific
datasets, enabling our model to capture interdependencies between body parts
while avoiding overfitting to specific actions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate DPoser-X's robustness and versatility across multiple benchmarks
for body, hand, face, and full-body pose modeling. Our model consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives, establishing a new benchmark for
whole-body human pose prior modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无约束环境下的人脸识别系统面临光照、姿态等挑战，需依赖人脸检测模块进行对齐。研究旨在揭示这些模块的潜在攻击漏洞。

Method: 提出两种攻击方法：Face Generation Attacks和Landmark Shift Attack，针对人脸检测的边界框和地标坐标回归任务。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了人脸检测模块的安全漏洞，并提出了相应的防御策略。

Abstract: Face Recognition Systems that operate in unconstrained environments capture
images under varying conditions,such as inconsistent lighting, or diverse face
poses. These challenges require including a Face Detection module that
regresses bounding boxes and landmark coordinates for proper Face Alignment.
This paper shows the effectiveness of Object Generation Attacks on Face
Detection, dubbed Face Generation Attacks, and demonstrates for the first time
a Landmark Shift Attack that backdoors the coordinate regression task performed
by face detectors. We then offer mitigations against these vulnerabilities.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过生成模型合成属性标注数据的方法，以解决医学图像中属性标注数据稀缺的问题，从而提升可解释模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强医学图像诊断中分类模型的可解释性，使其更符合临床推理，但由于属性标注数据稀缺，限制了此类模型的应用。

Method: 利用扩散模型生成属性标注数据，仅需少量真实标注样本（20个肺结节样本），并将其用于训练可解释模型。

Result: 生成的合成数据显著提升了模型性能，属性预测准确率提高13.4%，目标预测准确率提高1.8%。

Conclusion: 合成数据能有效克服数据集限制，提升可解释模型在医学图像分析中的实用性。

Abstract: Classification models that provide human-interpretable explanations enhance
clinicians' trust and usability in medical image diagnosis. One research focus
is the integration and prediction of pathology-related visual attributes used
by radiologists alongside the diagnosis, aligning AI decision-making with
clinical reasoning. Radiologists use attributes like shape and texture as
established diagnostic criteria and mirroring these in AI decision-making both
enhances transparency and enables explicit validation of model outputs.
However, the adoption of such models is limited by the scarcity of large-scale
medical image datasets annotated with these attributes. To address this
challenge, we propose synthesizing attribute-annotated data using a generative
model. We enhance the Diffusion Model with attribute conditioning and train it
using only 20 attribute-labeled lung nodule samples from the LIDC-IDRI dataset.
Incorporating its generated images into the training of an explainable model
boosts performance, increasing attribute prediction accuracy by 13.4% and
target prediction accuracy by 1.8% compared to training with only the small
real attribute-annotated dataset. This work highlights the potential of
synthetic data to overcome dataset limitations, enhancing the applicability of
explainable models in medical image analysis.

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个针对目标检测器补丁攻击的防御基准，通过大规模数据集和综合分析揭示了防御性能的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御评估缺乏统一框架，导致评估不一致且不完整，需建立全面基准以改进防御方法。

Method: 重新评估11种代表性防御方法，构建包含2种攻击目标、13种补丁攻击、11种目标检测器和4种指标的基准，并创建大规模对抗补丁数据集。

Result: 发现防御自然补丁的难点在于数据分布而非高频特征；平均精度与防御性能高度一致；自适应攻击可绕过现有防御。

Conclusion: 研究为补丁攻击/防御的评估和设计提供了指导，数据集和代码将不断更新。

Abstract: Developing reliable defenses against patch attacks on object detectors has
attracted increasing interest. However, we identify that existing defense
evaluations lack a unified and comprehensive framework, resulting in
inconsistent and incomplete assessments of current methods. To address this
issue, we revisit 11 representative defenses and present the first patch
defense benchmark, involving 2 attack goals, 13 patch attacks, 11 object
detectors, and 4 diverse metrics. This leads to the large-scale adversarial
patch dataset with 94 types of patches and 94,000 images. Our comprehensive
analyses reveal new insights: (1) The difficulty in defending against
naturalistic patches lies in the data distribution, rather than the commonly
believed high frequencies. Our new dataset with diverse patch distributions can
be used to improve existing defenses by 15.09% AP@0.5. (2) The average
precision of the attacked object, rather than the commonly pursued patch
detection accuracy, shows high consistency with defense performance. (3)
Adaptive attacks can substantially bypass existing defenses, and defenses with
complex/stochastic models or universal patch properties are relatively robust.
We hope that our analyses will serve as guidance on properly evaluating patch
attacks/defenses and advancing their design. Code and dataset are available at
https://github.com/Gandolfczjh/APDE, where we will keep integrating new
attacks/defenses.

Result: 实验验证了该方法的有效性和广泛适用性。

Conclusion: 预训练深度特征在去雾任务中表现一致，提出的模块具有普适性和高效性。

Abstract: Image dehazing remains a challenging problem due to the spatially varying
nature of haze in real-world scenes. While existing methods have demonstrated
the promise of large-scale pretrained models for image dehazing, their
architecture-specific designs hinder adaptability across diverse scenarios with
different accuracy and efficiency requirements. In this work, we systematically
investigate the generalization capability of pretrained depth
representations-learned from millions of diverse images-for image dehazing. Our
empirical analysis reveals that the learned deep depth features maintain
remarkable consistency across varying haze levels. Building on this insight, we
propose a plug-and-play RGB-D fusion module that seamlessly integrates with
diverse dehazing architectures. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks validate both the effectiveness and broad applicability of our
approach.

<details>

Motivation: 现有检测方法对合成视频中时间伪影的探索不足，导致检测效果有限，需要一种更有效的方法来填补这一空白。

Method: 通过牛顿力学下的二阶动态分析建立理论框架，提出基于二阶中心差分特征的D3方法，利用真实与AI生成视频在二阶特征分布上的差异进行检测。

Result: D3在4个开源数据集上表现优异，例如在Gen-Video上比之前最佳方法提高了10.39%的平均精度，同时具有高效计算和强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: D3通过二阶时间差异显著提升了AI生成视频的检测性能，为合成内容识别提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: The evolution of video generation techniques, such as Sora, has made it
increasingly easy to produce high-fidelity AI-generated videos, raising public
concern over the dissemination of synthetic content. However, existing
detection methodologies remain limited by their insufficient exploration of
temporal artifacts in synthetic videos. To bridge this gap, we establish a
theoretical framework through second-order dynamical analysis under Newtonian
mechanics, subsequently extending the Second-order Central Difference features
tailored for temporal artifact detection. Building on this theoretical
foundation, we reveal a fundamental divergence in second-order feature
distributions between real and AI-generated videos. Concretely, we propose
Detection by Difference of Differences (D3), a novel training-free detection
method that leverages the above second-order temporal discrepancies. We
validate the superiority of our D3 on 4 open-source datasets (Gen-Video,
VideoPhy, EvalCrafter, VidProM), 40 subsets in total. For example, on GenVideo,
D3 outperforms the previous best method by 10.39% (absolute) mean Average
Precision. Additional experiments on time cost and post-processing operations
demonstrate D3's exceptional computational efficiency and strong robust
performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/Zig-HS/D3.

Abstract: Despite growing interest in hallucination in Multimodal Large Language
Models, existing studies primarily focus on single-image settings, leaving
hallucination in multi-image scenarios largely unexplored. To address this gap,
we conduct the first systematic study of hallucinations in multi-image MLLMs
and propose MIHBench, a benchmark specifically tailored for evaluating
object-related hallucinations across multiple images. MIHBench comprises three
core tasks: Multi-Image Object Existence Hallucination, Multi-Image Object
Count Hallucination, and Object Identity Consistency Hallucination, targeting
semantic understanding across object existence, quantity reasoning, and
cross-view identity consistency. Through extensive evaluation, we identify key
factors associated with the occurrence of multi-image hallucinations,
including: a progressive relationship between the number of image inputs and
the likelihood of hallucination occurrences; a strong correlation between
single-image hallucination tendencies and those observed in multi-image
contexts; and the influence of same-object image ratios and the positional
placement of negative samples within image sequences on the occurrence of
object identity consistency hallucination. To address these challenges, we
propose a Dynamic Attention Balancing mechanism that adjusts inter-image
attention distributions while preserving the overall visual attention
proportion. Experiments across multiple state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrate that
our method effectively reduces hallucination occurrences and enhances semantic
integration and reasoning stability in multi-image scenarios.

Motivation: 解决开放词汇计数与文本到图像生成控制之间的差距，提供更精确的对象数量估计和生成指导。

Method: 提出'cardinality'映射作为回归目标，结合表示对齐和混合强弱监督方案，采用完全可微分架构。

Result: 在实验中表现出最先进的计数准确性，并为文本到图像系统提供稳健的数量控制。

Conclusion: YOLO-Count在开放词汇计数和生成控制方面具有显著优势，为相关应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose YOLO-Count, a differentiable open-vocabulary object counting model
that tackles both general counting challenges and enables precise quantity
control for text-to-image (T2I) generation. A core contribution is the
'cardinality' map, a novel regression target that accounts for variations in
object size and spatial distribution. Leveraging representation alignment and a
hybrid strong-weak supervision scheme, YOLO-Count bridges the gap between
open-vocabulary counting and T2I generation control. Its fully differentiable
architecture facilitates gradient-based optimization, enabling accurate object
count estimation and fine-grained guidance for generative models. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that YOLO-Count achieves state-of-the-art counting
accuracy while providing robust and effective quantity control for T2I systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级骨干网络Dense Backbone，用于3D目标检测，显著降低了计算成本，同时保持了检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D目标检测方法多依赖复杂骨干网络（如VGG或ResNet），增加了模型复杂度，而轻量级骨干网络在3D检测领域研究较少。

Method: 提出Dense Backbone，结合高速处理、轻量架构和鲁棒检测精度，适配多种先进3D检测器（如PillarNet）。

Result: DensePillarNet在nuScenes测试集上减少了29%参数和28%延迟，仅损失2%检测精度。

Conclusion: Dense Backbone为3D目标检测提供了高效轻量的解决方案，且易于集成到现有架构中。

Abstract: Recent advancements in LiDAR-based 3D object detection have significantly
accelerated progress toward the realization of fully autonomous driving in
real-world environments. Despite achieving high detection performance, most of
the approaches still rely on a VGG-based or ResNet-based backbone for feature
exploration, which increases the model complexity. Lightweight backbone design
is well-explored for 2D object detection, but research on 3D object detection
still remains limited. In this work, we introduce Dense Backbone, a lightweight
backbone that combines the benefits of high processing speed, lightweight
architecture, and robust detection accuracy. We adapt multiple SoTA 3d object
detectors, such as PillarNet, with our backbone and show that with our
backbone, these models retain most of their detection capability at a
significantly reduced computational cost. To our knowledge, this is the first
dense-layer-based backbone tailored specifically for 3D object detection from
point cloud data. DensePillarNet, our adaptation of PillarNet, achieves a 29%
reduction in model parameters and a 28% reduction in latency with just a 2%
drop in detection accuracy on the nuScenes test set. Furthermore, Dense
Backbone's plug-and-play design allows straightforward integration into
existing architectures, requiring no modifications to other network components.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自监督视觉基础模型在捕捉语义对应时缺乏对3D几何的感知，GECO旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用最优传输的训练框架，生成几何一致的特征，支持遮挡和去遮挡情况下的监督。

Result: GECO在PFPascal、APK和CUB数据集上实现了6.0%、6.2%和4.1%的PCK提升，运行速度达30 fps。

Conclusion: PCK指标不足以全面评估几何质量，GECO提出了新的几何感知指标，为特征学习提供了更深入的见解。

Abstract: Recent advances in feature learning have shown that self-supervised vision
foundation models can capture semantic correspondences but often lack awareness
of underlying 3D geometry. GECO addresses this gap by producing geometrically
coherent features that semantically distinguish parts based on geometry (e.g.,
left/right eyes, front/back legs). We propose a training framework based on
optimal transport, enabling supervision beyond keypoints, even under occlusions
and disocclusions. With a lightweight architecture, GECO runs at 30 fps, 98.2%
faster than prior methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance on
PFPascal, APK, and CUB, improving PCK by 6.0%, 6.2%, and 4.1%, respectively.
Finally, we show that PCK alone is insufficient to capture geometric quality
and introduce new metrics and insights for more geometry-aware feature
learning. Link to project page:

Conclusion: 研究强调了在头像通信系统中开发更先进行为生物特征防御技术的紧迫性，并提供了公开数据集和生物特征系统。

Abstract: Photorealistic talking-head avatars are becoming increasingly common in
virtual meetings, gaming, and social platforms. These avatars allow for more
immersive communication, but they also introduce serious security risks. One
emerging threat is impersonation: an attacker can steal a user's
avatar-preserving their appearance and voice-making it nearly impossible to
detect its fraudulent usage by sight or sound alone. In this paper, we explore
the challenge of biometric verification in such avatar-mediated scenarios. Our
main question is whether an individual's facial motion patterns can serve as
reliable behavioral biometrics to verify their identity when the avatar's
visual appearance is a facsimile of its owner. To answer this question, we
introduce a new dataset of realistic avatar videos created using a
state-of-the-art one-shot avatar generation model, GAGAvatar, with genuine and
impostor avatar videos. We also propose a lightweight, explainable
spatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Network architecture with temporal
attention pooling, that uses only facial landmarks to model dynamic facial
gestures. Experimental results demonstrate that facial motion cues enable
meaningful identity verification with AUC values approaching 80%. The proposed
benchmark and biometric system are available for the research community in
order to bring attention to the urgent need for more advanced behavioral
biometric defenses in avatar-based communication systems.

Result: 在PSNR、SSIM和LPIPS指标上与基线ESRGAN相当，适用于卫星和无人机系统。

Conclusion: SU-ESRGAN在跨域应用中表现良好，强调了领域感知训练的重要性。

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved realistic
super-resolution (SR) of images however, they lack semantic consistency and
per-pixel confidence, limiting their credibility in critical remote sensing
applications such as disaster response, urban planning and agriculture. This
paper introduces Semantic and Uncertainty-Aware ESRGAN (SU-ESRGAN), the first
SR framework designed for satellite imagery to integrate the ESRGAN,
segmentation loss via DeepLabv3 for class detail preservation and Monte Carlo
dropout to produce pixel-wise uncertainty maps. The SU-ESRGAN produces results
(PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) comparable to the Baseline ESRGAN on aerial imagery. This
novel model is valuable in satellite systems or UAVs that use wide
field-of-view (FoV) cameras, trading off spatial resolution for coverage. The
modular design allows integration in UAV data pipelines for on-board or
post-processing SR to enhance imagery resulting due to motion blur, compression
and sensor limitations. Further, the model is fine-tuned to evaluate its
performance on cross domain applications. The tests are conducted on two drone
based datasets which differ in altitude and imaging perspective. Performance
evaluation of the fine-tuned models show a stronger adaptation to the Aerial
Maritime Drone Dataset, whose imaging characteristics align with the training
data, highlighting the importance of domain-aware training in SR-applications.

Conclusion: 动态样本特异性调整是提升模型在真实场景中适应性的有效途径。

Abstract: Image-to-image translation has emerged as a powerful technique in medical
imaging, enabling tasks such as image denoising and cross-modality conversion.
However, it suffers from limitations in handling out-of-distribution samples
without causing performance degradation. To address this limitation, we propose
a novel Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) framework that dynamically adjusts the
translation process based on the characteristics of each test sample. Our
method introduces a Reconstruction Module to quantify the domain shift and a
Dynamic Adaptation Block that selectively modifies the internal features of a
pretrained translation model to mitigate the shift without compromising the
performance on in-distribution samples that do not require adaptation. We
evaluate our approach on two medical image-to-image translation tasks: low-dose
CT denoising and T1 to T2 MRI translation, showing consistent improvements over
both the baseline translation model without TTA and prior TTA methods. Our
analysis highlights the limitations of the state-of-the-art that uniformly
apply the adaptation to both out-of-distribution and in-distribution samples,
demonstrating that dynamic, sample-specific adjustment offers a promising path
to improve model resilience in real-world scenarios. The code is available at:

Result: 在13个工业和医学基准测试中，PILOT在领域转移下的异常检测和定位性能达到最优。

Conclusion: PILOT通过动态提示学习和测试时适应，显著提升了零样本异常检测的泛化能力。

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) enables identifying and localizing defects
in unseen categories by relying solely on generalizable features rather than
requiring any labeled examples of anomalies. However, existing ZSAD methods,
whether using fixed or learned prompts, struggle under domain shifts because
their training data are derived from limited training domains and fail to
generalize to new distributions. In this paper, we introduce PILOT, a framework
designed to overcome these challenges through two key innovations: (1) a novel
dual-branch prompt learning mechanism that dynamically integrates a pool of
learnable prompts with structured semantic attributes, enabling the model to
adaptively weight the most relevant anomaly cues for each input image; and (2)
a label-free test-time adaptation strategy that updates the learnable prompt
parameters using high-confidence pseudo-labels from unlabeled test data.
Extensive experiments on 13 industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate that
PILOT achieves state-of-the-art performance in both anomaly detection and
localization under domain shift.

Result: 几何大物体（如楼梯、窗户）分割效果较好，小安全相关特征识别率低，受类别不平衡和几何限制影响。

Conclusion: 公共安全领域的可靠点云语义分割需标准化标注协议和改进标注技术，以应对数据异构性和小物体检测问题。

Abstract: This study analyzes semantic segmentation performance across heterogeneously
labeled point-cloud datasets relevant to public safety applications, including
pre-incident planning systems derived from lidar scans. Using NIST's Point
Cloud City dataset (Enfield and Memphis collections), we investigate challenges
in unifying differently labeled 3D data. Our methodology employs a graded
schema with the KPConv architecture, evaluating performance through IoU metrics
on safety-relevant features. Results indicate performance variability:
geometrically large objects (e.g. stairs, windows) achieve higher segmentation
performance, suggesting potential for navigational context, while smaller
safety-critical features exhibit lower recognition rates. Performance is
impacted by class imbalance and the limited geometric distinction of smaller
objects in typical lidar scans, indicating limitations in detecting certain
safety-relevant features using current point-cloud methods. Key identified
challenges include insufficient labeled data, difficulties in unifying class
labels across datasets, and the need for standardization. Potential directions
include automated labeling and multi-dataset learning strategies. We conclude
that reliable point-cloud semantic segmentation for public safety necessitates
standardized annotation protocols and improved labeling techniques to address
data heterogeneity and the detection of small, safety-critical elements.

Abstract: Visual navigation with an image as goal is a fundamental and challenging
problem. Conventional methods either rely on end-to-end RL learning or
modular-based policy with topological graph or BEV map as memory, which cannot
fully model the geometric relationship between the explored 3D environment and
the goal image. In order to efficiently and accurately localize the goal image
in 3D space, we build our navigation system upon the renderable 3D gaussian
(3DGS) representation. However, due to the computational intensity of 3DGS
optimization and the large search space of 6-DoF camera pose, directly
leveraging 3DGS for image localization during agent exploration process is
prohibitively inefficient. To this end, we propose IGL-Nav, an Incremental 3D
Gaussian Localization framework for efficient and 3D-aware image-goal
navigation. Specifically, we incrementally update the scene representation as
new images arrive with feed-forward monocular prediction. Then we coarsely
localize the goal by leveraging the geometric information for discrete space
matching, which can be equivalent to efficient 3D convolution. When the agent
is close to the goal, we finally solve the fine target pose with optimization
via differentiable rendering. The proposed IGL-Nav outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods by a large margin across diverse experimental
configurations. It can also handle the more challenging free-view image-goal
setting and be deployed on real-world robotic platform using a cellphone to
capture goal image at arbitrary pose. Project page:
