In recent years, advancements in Unmanned\nAerial Vehicles (UAV) technology have further propelled this field to new\nheights, giving rise to a broader range of application requirements. However,\ntraditional UAV aerial object detection methods primarily focus on detecting\npredefined categories, which significantly limits their applicability. The\nadvent of cross-modal text-image alignment (e.g., CLIP) has overcome this\nlimitation, enabling open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD), which can\nidentify previously unseen objects through natural language descriptions. This\nbreakthrough significantly enhances the intelligence and autonomy of UAVs in\naerial scene understanding. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of OVOD\nin the context of UAV aerial scenes. We begin by aligning the core principles\nof OVOD with the unique characteristics of UAV vision, setting the stage for a\nspecialized discussion. Building on this foundation, we construct a systematic\ntaxonomy that categorizes existing OVOD methods for aerial imagery and provides\na comprehensive overview of the relevant datasets. This structured review\nenables us to critically dissect the key challenges and open problems at the\nintersection of these fields. Finally, based on this analysis, we outline\npromising future research directions and application prospects. This survey\naims to provide a clear road map and a valuable reference for both newcomers\nand seasoned researchers, fostering innovation in this rapidly evolving domain.\nWe keep tracing related works at\nhttps://github.com/zhouyang2002/OVOD-in-UVA-imagery", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\uff08UAV\uff09\u822a\u62cd\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08OVOD\uff09\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u539f\u7406\u3001\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ca\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u800cOVOD\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6587\u672c-\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08\u5982CLIP\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u6027\u548c\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709OVOD\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u548c\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u671b\u4e86OVOD\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u822a\u62cd\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

First, while the Multiple Choice\nQuestion (MCQ) setting has been shown to be vulnerable to perturbations, there\nis no systematic comparison of probing methods for value probing. Second, it is\nunclear to what extent the probed values capture in-context information and\nreflect models' preferences for real-world actions. In this paper, we evaluate\nthe robustness and expressiveness of value representations across three widely\nused probing strategies. We use variations in prompts and options, showing that\nall methods exhibit large variances under input perturbations.

Traditional clinical rating scales, though validated, are\nresource-intensive and lack scalability. Automated speech analysis with\nautomatic speech recognition (ASR) allows for objective quantification of\nlinguistic and temporal features of speech, offering scalable alternatives. The\nuse of utterance timestamps in ASR captures pause dynamics, which are thought\nto reflect the cognitive processes underlying speech production. However, the\nutility of integrating these ASR-derived features for assessing FTD severity\nrequires further evaluation. This study integrates pause features with semantic\ncoherence metrics across three datasets: naturalistic self-recorded diaries\n(AVH, n = 140), structured picture descriptions (TOPSY, n = 72), and dream\nnarratives (PsyCL, n = 43). We evaluated pause related features alongside\nestablished coherence measures, using support vector regression (SVR) to\npredict clinical FTD scores. Key findings demonstrate that pause features alone\nrobustly predict the severity of FTD. Integrating pause features with semantic\ncoherence metrics enhanced predictive performance compared to semantic-only\nmodels, with integration of independent models achieving correlations up to\n\\r{ho} = 0.649 and AUC = 83.71% for severe cases detection (TOPSY, with best\n\\r{ho} = 0.584 and AUC = 79.23% for semantic-only models). The performance\ngains from semantic and pause features integration held consistently across all\ncontexts, though the nature of pause patterns was dataset-dependent.

Unlike traditional methods, which rely on adding noise or\nperturbations to AI-generated images, IConMark incorporates meaningful semantic\nattributes, making it interpretable to humans and hence, resilient to\nadversarial manipulation. This method is not only robust against various image\naugmentations but also human-readable, enabling manual verification of\nwatermarks. We demonstrate a detailed evaluation of IConMark's effectiveness,\ndemonstrating its superiority in terms of detection accuracy and maintaining\nimage quality. Moreover, IConMark can be combined with existing watermarking\ntechniques to further enhance and complement its robustness.

Methods: We developed a\nmulti-model deep learning system using 10,000 annotated shoulder X-rays.\nArchitectures include Faster R-CNN (ResNet50-FPN, ResNeXt), EfficientDet, and\nRF-DETR. To enhance detection, we applied bounding box and classification-level\nensemble techniques such as Soft-NMS, WBF, and NMW fusion. Results: The NMW\nensemble achieved 95.5% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.9610, outperforming\nindividual models across all key metrics. It demonstrated strong recall and\nlocalization precision, confirming its effectiveness for clinical fracture\ndetection in shoulder X-rays. Conclusion: The results show ensemble-based AI\ncan reliably detect shoulder fractures in radiographs with high clinical\nrelevance. The model's accuracy and deployment readiness position it well for\nintegration into real-time diagnostic workflows. The current model is limited\nto binary fracture detection, reflecting its design for rapid screening and\ntriage support rather than detailed orthopedic classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u80a9\u90e8X\u5149\u7247\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u9aa8\u6298\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe95.5%\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u5feb\u901f\u7b5b\u67e5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u80a9\u90e8\u9aa8\u6298\u5728\u6025\u8bca\u548c\u9ad8\u8d1f\u8377\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6f0f\u8bca\u7387\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528AI\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u5347\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08Faster R-CNN\u3001EfficientDet\u3001RF-DETR\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u7ea7\u96c6\u6210\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982Soft-NMS\u3001WBF\u3001NMW\u878d\u5408\uff09\u3002", "result": "NMW\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0895.5%\uff09\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\uff080.9610\uff09\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u96c6\u6210AI\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u68c0\u6d4b\u80a9\u90e8\u9aa8\u6298\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u65f6\u8bca\u65ad\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u4e8c\u5143\u9aa8\u6298\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5feb\u901f\u7b5b\u67e5\u800c\u975e\u8be6\u7ec6\u5206\u7c7b\u3002"}}

First, it performs online sparsification during the\nprefilling phase by dynamically selecting the most important parts of the\nattention matrix for each new input. Second, it uses progressive key value\ncompression during decoding by adaptively maintaining a relevant and efficient\ncache based on the most recently generated output tokens. We also propose a\n\\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/TreeAILab/Multi-turn_Long-context_Benchmark_for_LLMs}{new\nbenchmark} with eleven multi-turn datasets that reflect realistic query\npositions and conversational dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat LoopServe consistently achieves superior effectiveness compared to\nexisting baselines and significantly accelerates LLM inference across a wide\nrange of long-context dialogue tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "LoopServe\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u952e\u503c\u538b\u7f29\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5386\u53f2\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5728\u7ebf\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u952e\u503c\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "LoopServe\u4e3a\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684LLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Unlike airborne\nLiDAR, which typically delivers consistent accuracy across various scenes, the\naccuracy of photogrammetric point clouds is highly scene-dependent, since it\nrelies on algorithm-generated measurements (i.e., stereo or multi-view stereo).\nGenerally, errors of the photogrammetric point clouds propagate through a\ntwo-step process: Structure-from-Motion (SfM) with Bundle adjustment (BA),\nfollowed by Multi-view Stereo (MVS). While uncertainty estimation in the SfM\nstage has been well studied using the first-order statistics of the\nreprojection error function, that in the MVS stage remains largely unsolved and\nnon-standardized, primarily due to its non-differentiable and multi-modal\nnature (i.e., from pixel values to geometry). In this paper, we present an\nuncertainty quantification framework closing this gap by associating an error\ncovariance matrix per point accounting for this two-step photogrammetry\nprocess. Specifically, to estimate the uncertainty in the MVS stage, we propose\na novel, self-calibrating method by taking reliable n-view points (n>=6)\nper-view to regress the disparity uncertainty using highly relevant cues (such\nas matching cost values) from the MVS stage. Compared to existing approaches,\nour method uses self-contained, reliable 3D points extracted directly from the\nMVS process, with the benefit of being self-supervised and naturally adhering\nto error propagation path of the photogrammetry process, thereby providing a\nrobust and certifiable uncertainty quantification across diverse scenes.

However, the sole\nusage of NeRF suffers from a lack of details, which results in the emergence of\nhybrid representation that utilizes SMPL-based mesh together with NeRF\nrepresentation. While hybrid-based models show photo-realistic human avatar\ngeneration qualities, they suffer from extremely slow inference due to their\ndeformation scheme: to be aligned with the mesh, hybrid-based models use the\ndeformation based on SMPL skinning weights, which needs high computational\ncosts on each sampled point. We observe that since most of the sampled points\nare located in empty space, they do not affect the generation quality but\nresult in inference latency with deformation. In light of this observation, we\npropose EPSilon, a hybrid-based 3D avatar generation scheme with novel\nefficient point sampling strategies that boost both training and inference. In\nEPSilon, we propose two methods to omit empty points at rendering; empty ray\nomission (ERO) and empty interval omission (EIO). In ERO, we wipe out rays that\nprogress through the empty space. Then, EIO narrows down the sampling interval\non the ray, which wipes out the region not occupied by either clothes or mesh.\nThe delicate sampling scheme of EPSilon enables not only great computational\ncost reduction during deformation but also the designation of the important\nregions to be sampled, which enables a single-stage NeRF structure without\nhierarchical sampling. Compared to existing methods, EPSilon maintains the\ngeneration quality while using only 3.9% of sampled points and achieves around\n20 times faster inference, together with 4 times faster training convergence.\nWe provide video results on https://github.com/seungjun-moon/epsilon.", "AI": {"tldr": "EPSilon\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u70b9\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7701\u7565\u7a7a\u70b9\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u6df7\u54083D\u5934\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eNeRF\u548cSMPL\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u53d8\u5f62\u65b9\u6848\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u800c\u63a8\u7406\u7f13\u6162\uff0cEPSilon\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "EPSilon\u5f15\u5165\u7a7a\u5c04\u7ebf\u7701\u7565\uff08ERO\uff09\u548c\u7a7a\u533a\u95f4\u7701\u7565\uff08EIO\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u65e0\u6548\u91c7\u6837\u70b9\u3002", "result": "EPSilon\u4ec5\u97003.9%\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u70b9\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u7ea620\u500d\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53474\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "EPSilon\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6df7\u54083D\u5934\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

Inspired by the above findings, we propose a novel and efficient\nrestoration baseline, named Pyramid Wavelet-Fourier Network (PW-FNet).\nSpecifically, PW-FNet features two key design principles: 1) at the inter-block\nlevel, integrates a pyramid wavelet-based multi-input multi-output structure to\nachieve multi-scale and multi-frequency bands decomposition; and 2) at the\nintra-block level, incorporates Fourier transforms as an efficient alternative\nto self-attention mechanisms, effectively reducing computational complexity\nwhile preserving global modeling capability. Extensive experiments on tasks\nsuch as image deraining, raindrop removal, image super-resolution, motion\ndeblurring, image dehazing, image desnowing and underwater/low-light\nenhancement demonstrate that PW-FNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art\nmethods in restoration quality but also achieves superior efficiency, with\nsignificantly reduced parameter size, computational cost and inference time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPW-FNet\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u9ad8\u6548\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5c0f\u6ce2\u548c\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4fee\u590d\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u6076\u52a3\u5929\u6c14\u6761\u4ef6\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u6709\u6548\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u3002", "method": "PW-FNet\u91c7\u7528\u91d1\u5b57\u5854\u5c0f\u6ce2\u591a\u8f93\u5165\u591a\u8f93\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5757\u5185\u7528\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u66ff\u4ee3\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPW-FNet\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8d28\u91cf\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd8\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "PW-FNet\u901a\u8fc7\u5c0f\u6ce2\u548c\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Our core idea is to leverage the masking-then-reconstruction\nstrategy of MAE to encourage the feature encoder to infer missing spatial and\nstructural information, thereby facilitating geometric-aware and\nocclusion-robust representation learning. Specifically, based on our\nobservation that human hands exhibit far greater geometric complexity than\nrigid objects, conventional uniform masking fails to effectively guide the\nreconstruction of fine-grained hand structures. To overcome this limitation, we\nintroduce a Region-specific Mask Ratio Allocation, primarily comprising the\nregion-specific masking assignment and the skeleton-driven hand masking\nguidance. The former adaptively assigns lower masking ratios to hand regions\nthan to rigid objects, balancing their feature learning difficulty, while the\nlatter prioritizes masking critical hand parts (e.g., fingertips or entire\nfingers) to realistically simulate occlusion patterns in real-world\ninteractions. Furthermore, to enhance the geometric awareness of the pretrained\nencoder, we introduce a novel Masked Signed Distance Field (SDF)-driven\nmultimodal learning mechanism. Through the self-masking 3D SDF prediction, the\nlearned encoder is able to perceive the global geometric structure of hands and\nobjects beyond the 2D image plane, overcoming the inherent limitations of\nmonocular input and alleviating self-occlusion issues.

However, their top-down training\napproach on general corpora is insufficient for acquiring abstractions needed\nfor deep domain expertise. This may require a bottom-up approach that acquires\nexpertise by learning to compose simple domain concepts into more complex ones.\nA knowledge graph (KG) provides this compositional structure, where domain\nprimitives are represented as head-relation-tail edges and their paths encode\nhigher-level concepts. We present a task generation pipeline that synthesizes\ntasks directly from KG primitives, enabling models to acquire and compose them\nfor reasoning. We fine-tune language models on the resultant KG-grounded\ncurriculum to demonstrate domain-specific superintelligence. While broadly\napplicable, we validate our approach in medicine, where reliable KGs exist.\nUsing a medical KG, we curate 24,000 reasoning tasks paired with thinking\ntraces derived from diverse medical primitives. We fine-tune the QwQ-32B model\non this curriculum to obtain QwQ-Med-3 that takes a step towards medical\nsuperintelligence. We also introduce ICD-Bench, an evaluation suite to quantify\nreasoning abilities across 15 medical domains. Our experiments demonstrate that\nQwQ-Med-3 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning models on\nICD-Bench categories. Further analysis reveals that QwQ-Med-3 utilizes acquired\nprimitives to widen the performance gap on the hardest tasks of ICD-Bench.\nFinally, evaluation on medical question-answer benchmarks shows that QwQ-Med-3\ntransfers acquired expertise to enhance the base model's performance.

A\ncritical factor in this process is the model's ability to accurately interpret\ntextual prompts. However, these models often struggle with creative\nexpressions, particularly those involving complex, abstract, or highly\ndescriptive language. In this work, we introduce a novel training-free approach\ntailored to improve image generation for a unique form of creative language:\npoetic verse, which frequently features layered, abstract, and dual meanings.\nOur proposed PoemTale Diffusion approach aims to minimise the information that\nis lost during poetic text-to-image conversion by integrating a multi stage\nprompt refinement loop into Language Models to enhance the interpretability of\npoetic texts. To support this, we adapt existing state-of-the-art diffusion\nmodels by modifying their self-attention mechanisms with a consistent\nself-attention technique to generate multiple consistent images, which are then\ncollectively used to convey the poem's meaning. Moreover, to encourage research\nin the field of poetry, we introduce the P4I (PoemForImage) dataset, consisting\nof 1111 poems sourced from multiple online and offline resources.

One powerful tool in this domain is StyleGAN (style-based\ngenerative adversarial networks), a generative adversarial network capable of\nproducing highly realistic synthetic faces. To gain a deeper understanding of\nhow such a model operates, this work focuses on analyzing the inner workings of\nStyleGAN's generator component. Key architectural elements and techniques, such\nas the Equalized Learning Rate, are explored in detail to shed light on the\nmodel's behavior. A StyleGAN model is trained using the PyTorch framework,\nenabling direct inspection of its learned weights. Through pruning, it is\nrevealed that a significant number of these weights can be removed without\ndrastically affecting the output, leading to reduced computational\nrequirements. Moreover, the role of the latent vector -- which heavily\ninfluences the appearance of the generated faces -- is closely examined.

However, achieving both high imaging quality and effective motion\nrepresentation remains a significant challenge for these T2V models. Existing\napproaches often adapt pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models to refine video\nframes, leading to issues such as flickering and artifacts due to\ninconsistencies across frames. In this paper, we introduce EVS, a training-free\nEncapsulated Video Synthesizer that composes T2I and T2V models to enhance both\nvisual fidelity and motion smoothness of generated videos. Our approach\nutilizes a well-trained diffusion-based T2I model to refine low-quality video\nframes by treating them as out-of-distribution samples, effectively optimizing\nthem with noising and denoising steps. Meanwhile, we employ T2V backbones to\nensure consistent motion dynamics. By encapsulating the T2V temporal-only prior\ninto the T2I generation process, EVS successfully leverages the strengths of\nboth types of models, resulting in videos of improved imaging and motion\nquality. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach\ncompared to previous approaches.

We extend PE to two-dimensional images and\npropose a multiscale, multi-orientation entropy-based feature extraction\napproach that characterizes spatial order and complexity along rows, columns,\ndiagonals, anti-diagonals, and local patches of the image. To enhance the\ndiscriminatory power of the entropy features, we integrate two classic image\ndescriptors: the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) to capture shape and\nedge structure, and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) to encode micro-texture of an\nimage. The resulting hand-crafted feature set, comprising of 780 dimensions, is\nused to train Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers optimized through grid\nsearch. The proposed approach is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets,\nincluding Fashion-MNIST, KMNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10, where it delivers\ncompetitive classification performance without relying on deep architectures.\nOur results demonstrate that the fusion of PE with HOG and LBP provides a\ncompact, interpretable, and effective alternative to computationally expensive\nand limited interpretable deep learning models.

Built on public generative\nmodels and running without human intervention, our system uses a task-tuned\nGemini validator to score instruction adherence and aesthetics directly,\nremoving any need for segmentation or grounding models. Inversion and\ncompositional bootstrapping enlarge the mined set by approximately 2.2x,\nenabling large-scale high-fidelity training data. By automating the most\nrepetitive annotation steps, the approach allows a new scale of training\nwithout human labeling effort. To democratize research in this\nresource-intensive area, we release NHR-Edit: an open dataset of 358k\nhigh-quality triplets. In the largest cross-dataset evaluation, it surpasses\nall public alternatives. We also release Bagel-NHR-Edit, an open-source\nfine-tuned Bagel model, which achieves state-of-the-art metrics in our\nexperiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\uff08\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u6307\u4ee4\u3001\u7f16\u8f91\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u5f00\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u83b7\u53d6\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u516c\u5171\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\uff08Gemini\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u8f6c\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u6269\u5c55\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u4e86358k\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08NHR-Edit\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578bBagel-NHR-Edit\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

However, existing systems often face challenges: high model\ncomplexity hinders deployment in resource-constrained environments,\nunidirectional modal alignment neglects inter-modal relationships, and\nrobustness suffers when sensor data is missing. These issues impede efficient\nand robust multimodal perception in real-world IoT settings. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose GRAM-MAMBA. This framework utilizes the\nlinear-complexity Mamba model for efficient sensor time-series processing,\ncombined with an optimized GRAM matrix strategy for pairwise alignment among\nmodalities, addressing the shortcomings of traditional single-modality\nalignment. Inspired by Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we introduce an adaptive\nlow-rank layer compensation strategy to handle missing modalities\npost-training. This strategy freezes the pre-trained model core and irrelevant\nadaptive layers, fine-tuning only those related to available modalities and the\nfusion process. Extensive experiments validate GRAM-MAMBA's effectiveness.

Furthermore, we compare these conventional anonymization\ntechniques with the emerging privacy-by-design solutions, highlighting an often\noverlooked trade-off between robust privacy protection and utility flexibility.\nThrough comprehensive experiments and analyses, this study provides a\ncompelling benchmark and insights into balancing human privacy with the demands\nof anomaly detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u533f\u540d\u5316\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u67d0\u4e9b\u6280\u672f\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u53cd\u800c\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u7528\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u76d1\u63a7\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u6536\u96c6\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\u5f15\u53d1\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u533f\u540d\u5316\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5728UCF-Crime\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u906e\u7f69\u3001\u52a0\u5bc6\u548c\u865a\u62df\u66ff\u6362\u56db\u79cd\u533f\u540d\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u56db\u79cd\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u533f\u540d\u5316\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ecd\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9b\u533f\u540d\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u52a0\u5bc6\u548c\u906e\u7f69\uff09\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u751a\u81f3\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u533f\u540d\u5316\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u7528\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u68c0\u6d4b\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}
