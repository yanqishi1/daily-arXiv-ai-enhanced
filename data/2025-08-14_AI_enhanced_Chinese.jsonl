Since the approaches for general offensive content detection\nface a challenge in detecting misogynistic content, it requires solutions\ntailored to address offensive content against women. To this end, we propose a\nnovel multimodal framework for the detection of misogynistic and sexist\ncontent. The framework comprises three modules: the Multimodal Attention module\n(MANM), the Graph-based Feature Reconstruction Module (GFRM), and the\nContent-specific Features Learning Module (CFLM). The MANM employs adaptive\ngating-based multimodal context-aware attention, enabling the model to focus on\nrelevant visual and textual information and generating contextually relevant\nfeatures. The GFRM module utilizes graphs to refine features within individual\nmodalities, while the CFLM focuses on learning text and image-specific features\nsuch as toxicity features and caption features. Additionally, we curate a set\nof misogynous lexicons to compute the misogyny-specific lexicon score from the\ntext. We apply test-time augmentation in feature space to better generalize the\npredictions on diverse inputs. The performance of the proposed approach has\nbeen evaluated on two multimodal datasets, MAMI and MMHS150K, with 11,000 and\n13,494 samples, respectively.

However, deep FER models often struggle with subtle\nexpressions and high inter-subject variability, limiting their performance in\nreal-world applications. To improve their performance, source-free domain\nadaptation (SFDA) methods have been proposed to personalize a pretrained source\nmodel using only unlabeled target domain data, thereby avoiding data privacy,\nstorage, and transmission constraints. This paper addresses a challenging\nscenario where source data is unavailable for adaptation, and only unlabeled\ntarget data consisting solely of neutral expressions is available. SFDA methods\nare not typically designed to adapt using target data from only a single class.\nFurther, using models to generate facial images with non-neutral expressions\ncan be unstable and computationally intensive. In this paper, personalized\nfeature translation (PFT) is proposed for SFDA. Unlike current image\ntranslation methods for SFDA, our lightweight method operates in the latent\nspace. We first pre-train the translator on the source domain data to transform\nthe subject-specific style features from one source subject into another.\nExpression information is preserved by optimizing a combination of expression\nconsistency and style-aware objectives.

However, their vulnerability to adversarial prompts remains a\nserious concern, as safety mechanisms often fail to prevent the generation of\nharmful outputs. Although recent jailbreak strategies report high success\nrates, many responses classified as \"successful\" are actually benign, vague, or\nunrelated to the intended malicious goal. This mismatch suggests that current\nevaluation standards may overestimate the effectiveness of such attacks. To\naddress this issue, we introduce a four-axis evaluation framework that\nconsiders input on-topicness, input out-of-distribution (OOD) intensity, output\nharmfulness, and output refusal rate. This framework identifies truly effective\njailbreaks. In a substantial empirical study, we reveal a structural trade-off:\nhighly on-topic prompts are frequently blocked by safety filters, whereas those\nthat are too OOD often evade detection but fail to produce harmful content.\nHowever, prompts that balance relevance and novelty are more likely to evade\nfilters and trigger dangerous output. Building on this insight, we develop a\nrecursive rewriting strategy called Balanced Structural Decomposition (BSD).\nThe approach restructures malicious prompts into semantically aligned\nsub-tasks, while introducing subtle OOD signals and visual cues that make the\ninputs harder to detect. BSD was tested across 13 commercial and open-source\nMLLMs, where it consistently led to higher attack success rates, more harmful\noutputs, and fewer refusals. Compared to previous methods, it improves success\nrates by $67\\%$ and harmfulness by $21\\%$, revealing a previously\nunderappreciated weakness in current multimodal safety systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u56db\u8f74\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u9012\u5f52\u91cd\u5199\u7b56\u7565\uff08BSD\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u53ef\u80fd\u9ad8\u4f30\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e14\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u963b\u6b62\u6709\u5bb3\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u56db\u8f74\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u8f93\u5165\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001\u8f93\u5165OOD\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3001\u8f93\u51fa\u6709\u5bb3\u6027\u3001\u8f93\u51fa\u62d2\u7edd\u7387\uff09\u548cBSD\u9012\u5f52\u91cd\u5199\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "BSD\u572813\u4e2aMLLMs\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0867%\uff09\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u6709\u5bb3\u6027\uff0821%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b89\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5f31\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches manifest two critical\nlimitations in complex scenarios: (1) Over-reconstruction occurs when\npersistent large Gaussians cannot meet adaptive splitting thresholds during\ndensity control. This is exacerbated by conflicting gradient directions that\nprevent effective splitting of these Gaussians; (2) Over-densification of\nGaussians occurs in regions with aligned gradient aggregation, leading to\nredundant component proliferation. This redundancy significantly increases\nmemory overhead due to unnecessary data retention. We present\nGradient-Direction-Aware Gaussian Splatting (GDAGS), a gradient-direction-aware\nadaptive density control framework to address these challenges. Our key\ninnovations: the gradient coherence ratio (GCR), computed through normalized\ngradient vector norms, which explicitly discriminates Gaussians with concordant\nversus conflicting gradient directions; and a nonlinear dynamic weighting\nmechanism leverages the GCR to enable gradient-direction-aware density control.\nSpecifically, GDAGS prioritizes conflicting-gradient Gaussians during splitting\noperations to enhance geometric details while suppressing redundant\nconcordant-direction Gaussians. Conversely, in cloning processes, GDAGS\npromotes concordant-direction Gaussian densification for structural completion\nwhile preventing conflicting-direction Gaussian overpopulation.

Leveraging its high capability to generate high-fidelity and\ndiverse synthetic data, generative AI is widely applied in diagnostic tasks,\nsuch as lung cancer diagnosis using computed tomography (CT). However, existing\ngenerative models for lung cancer diagnosis suffer from low efficiency and\nanatomical imprecision, which limit their clinical applicability. To address\nthese drawbacks, we propose Lung-DDPM+, an improved version of our previous\nmodel, Lung-DDPM. This novel approach is a denoising diffusion probabilistic\nmodel (DDPM) guided by nodule semantic layouts and accelerated by a pulmonary\nDPM-solver, enabling the method to focus on lesion areas while achieving a\nbetter trade-off between sampling efficiency and quality. Evaluation results on\nthe public LIDC-IDRI dataset suggest that the proposed method achieves\n8$\\times$ fewer FLOPs (floating point operations per second), 6.8$\\times$ lower\nGPU memory consumption, and 14$\\times$ faster sampling compared to Lung-DDPM.\nMoreover, it maintains comparable sample quality to both Lung-DDPM and other\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models in two downstream segmentation tasks.\nWe also conducted a Visual Turing Test by an experienced radiologist, showing\nthe advanced quality and fidelity of synthetic samples generated by the\nproposed method. These experimental results demonstrate that Lung-DDPM+ can\neffectively generate high-quality thoracic CT images with lung nodules,\nhighlighting its potential for broader applications, such as general tumor\nsynthesis and lesion generation in medical imaging.

However, many current state-of-the-art attacks require access to\nmodels' hidden states or probability distribution, which prevents investigation\ninto more widely-used, API-access only models like GPT-4. In this work, we\nintroduce N-Gram Coverage Attack, a membership inference attack that relies\nsolely on text outputs from the target model, enabling attacks on completely\nblack-box models. We leverage the observation that models are more likely to\nmemorize and subsequently generate text patterns that were commonly observed in\ntheir training data. Specifically, to make a prediction on a candidate member,\nN-Gram Coverage Attack first obtains multiple model generations conditioned on\na prefix of the candidate. It then uses n-gram overlap metrics to compute and\naggregate the similarities of these outputs with the ground truth suffix; high\nsimilarities indicate likely membership. We first demonstrate on a diverse set\nof existing benchmarks that N-Gram Coverage Attack outperforms other black-box\nmethods while also impressively achieving comparable or even better performance\nto state-of-the-art white-box attacks - despite having access to only text\noutputs.

Despite its significance, obtaining micro-expression\n(ME) annotations is challenging due to the expertise required from\npsychological professionals. Consequently, ME datasets often suffer from a\nscarcity of training samples, severely constraining the learning of MER models.\nWhile current large pre-training models (LMs) offer general and discriminative\nrepresentations, their direct application to MER is hindered by an inability to\ncapture transitory and subtle facial movements-essential elements for effective\nMER. This paper introduces Motion Prompt Tuning (MPT) as a novel approach to\nadapting LMs for MER, representing a pioneering method for subtle motion prompt\ntuning. Particularly, we introduce motion prompt generation, including motion\nmagnification and Gaussian tokenization, to extract subtle motions as prompts\nfor LMs. Additionally, a group adapter is carefully designed and inserted into\nthe LM to enhance it in the target MER domain, facilitating a more nuanced\ndistinction of ME representation. Furthermore, extensive experiments conducted\non three widely used MER datasets demonstrate that our proposed MPT\nconsistently surpasses state-of-the-art approaches and verifies its\neffectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMotion Prompt Tuning (MPT)\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd0\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7ec4\u9002\u914d\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff08LMs\uff09\u9002\u5e94\u4e8e\u5fae\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\uff08MER\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fae\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\u5728\u533b\u7597\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u8c0e\u8a00\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u6807\u6ce8\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6837\u672c\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u5fae\u8868\u60c5\u7684\u77ed\u6682\u548c\u7ec6\u5fae\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "MPT\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u8fd0\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\uff08\u8fd0\u52a8\u653e\u5927\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\uff09\u548c\u7ec4\u9002\u914d\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3aLMs\u5728MER\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684MER\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMPT\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "MPT\u4e3a\u5fae\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u5e94LMs\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u5fae\u8fd0\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Extensive experiments show that HyperKD significantly\nimproves representation learning in MAEs, leading to enhanced reconstruction\nfidelity and more robust performance on downstream tasks such as land cover\nclassification, crop type identification, and soil organic carbon prediction,\nunderpinning the potential of knowledge distillation frameworks in remote\nsensing analytics with hyperspectral imagery.", "AI": {"tldr": "HyperKD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u5411\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u9065\u611f\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u5dee\u5f02\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\uff0c\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u9065\u611f\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u5149\u8c31\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "HyperKD\u5229\u7528Masked Autoencoder\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982\u5149\u8c31\u8303\u56f4\u901a\u9053\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff09\u4ecePrithvi\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5411EnMAP\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u79fb\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHyperKD\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86MAE\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u571f\u5730\u8986\u76d6\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u4f5c\u7269\u7c7b\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u571f\u58e4\u6709\u673a\u78b3\u9884\u6d4b\u7b49\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "conclusion": "HyperKD\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u5149\u8c31\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u9065\u611f\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, most existing methods only apply to human figures, which\nusually do not generalize well on anthropomorphic characters commonly used in\nindustries like gaming and entertainment. Furthermore, previous methods could\nonly generate videos with static backgrounds, which limits the realism of the\nvideos. For the first challenge, our in-depth analysis suggests to attribute\nthis limitation to their insufficient modeling of motion, which is unable to\ncomprehend the movement pattern of the driving video, thus imposing a pose\nsequence rigidly onto the target character. To this end, this paper proposes\nAnimate-X++, a universal animation framework based on DiT for various character\ntypes, including anthropomorphic characters. To enhance motion representation,\nwe introduce the Pose Indicator, which captures comprehensive motion pattern\nfrom the driving video through both implicit and explicit manner. The former\nleverages CLIP visual features of a driving video to extract its gist of\nmotion, like the overall movement pattern and temporal relations among motions,\nwhile the latter strengthens the generalization of DiT by simulating possible\ninputs in advance that may arise during inference. For the second challenge, we\nintroduce a multi-task training strategy that jointly trains the animation and\nTI2V tasks. Combined with the proposed partial parameter training, this\napproach achieves not only character animation but also text-driven background\ndynamics, making the videos more realistic.

However, security issues in visual\ngrounding tasks for VLMs remain underexplored, especially in the context of\nbackdoor attacks. In this paper, we introduce a novel input-aware backdoor\nattack method, IAG, designed to manipulate the grounding behavior of VLMs. This\nattack forces the model to ground a specific target object in the input image,\nregardless of the user's query. We propose an adaptive trigger generator that\nembeds the semantic information of the attack target's description into the\noriginal image using a text-conditional U-Net, thereby overcoming the\nopen-vocabulary attack challenge. To ensure the attack's stealthiness, we\nutilize a reconstruction loss to minimize visual discrepancies between poisoned\nand clean images. Additionally, we introduce a unified method for generating\nattack data. IAG is evaluated theoretically and empirically, demonstrating its\nfeasibility and effectiveness.

However, the availability of\ntrained clinicians has not scaled proportionally, leaving many people without\nadequate or timely support. To bridge this gap, recent studies have shown the\npromise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to assist mental health diagnosis,\nmonitoring, and intervention. However, the development of efficient, reliable,\nand ethical AI to assist clinicians is heavily dependent on high-quality\nclinical training datasets. Despite growing interest in data curation for\ntraining clinical AI assistants, existing datasets largely remain scattered,\nunder-documented, and often inaccessible, hindering the reproducibility,\ncomparability, and generalizability of AI models developed for clinical mental\nhealth care. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive survey of\nclinical mental health datasets relevant to the training and development of\nAI-powered clinical assistants. We categorize these datasets by mental\ndisorders (e.g., depression, schizophrenia), data modalities (e.g., text,\nspeech, physiological signals), task types (e.g., diagnosis prediction, symptom\nseverity estimation, intervention generation), accessibility (public,\nrestricted or private), and sociocultural context (e.g., language and cultural\nbackground). Along with these, we also investigate synthetic clinical mental\nhealth datasets. Our survey identifies critical gaps such as a lack of\nlongitudinal data, limited cultural and linguistic representation, inconsistent\ncollection and annotation standards, and a lack of modalities in synthetic\ndata.

During evaluation,\neach test sample is compared to the known fake and real samples, and it is\nclassified based on the category of the nearest sample. We conduct a\ncomprehensive analysis of AI-generated images from 29 different generative\nmodels and achieve a new SoTA performance, with an average improvement of 8.7\\%\ncompared to existing methods.

To address these, we present two key innovations.\nFirst, we introduce a Mixture of Facial Experts (MoFE) that dynamically\ncombines complementary cues from three specialized experts, each designed to\ncapture distinct but mutually reinforcing aspects of facial attributes. The\nidentity expert captures cross-pose identity-sensitive features, the semantic\nexpert extracts high-level visual semantxics, and the detail expert preserves\npixel-level features (e.g., skin texture, color gradients). Furthermore, to\nmitigate dataset limitations, we have tailored a data processing pipeline\ncentered on two key aspects: Face Constraints and Identity Consistency. Face\nConstraints ensure facial angle diversity and a high proportion of facial\nregions, while Identity Consistency preserves coherent person-specific features\nacross temporal sequences, collectively addressing the scarcity of large facial\nangles and identity-stable training data in existing datasets. Leveraging this\npipeline, we have curated and refined a Large Face Angles (LFA) Dataset from\nexisting open-source human video datasets, comprising 460K video clips with\nannotated facial angles. Experimental results on the LFA benchmark demonstrate\nthat our method, empowered by the LFA dataset, significantly outperforms prior\nSOTA methods in face similarity, face FID, and CLIP semantic alignment.

While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and its\nvariants have recently attracted attention for its high efficiency, existing\nmethods remain unsuitable for satellite images due to incompatibility with\nrational polynomial coefficient (RPC) models and limited generalization\ncapability. Recent advances in generalizable 3DGS approaches show potential,\nbut they perform poorly on multi-temporal sparse satellite images due to\nlimited geometric constraints, transient objects, and radiometric\ninconsistencies. To address these limitations, we propose SkySplat, a novel\nself-supervised framework that integrates the RPC model into the generalizable\n3DGS pipeline, enabling more effective use of sparse geometric cues for\nimproved reconstruction. SkySplat relies only on RGB images and\nradiometric-robust relative height supervision, thereby eliminating the need\nfor ground-truth height maps.

GPT-5-high achieved\nthe highest accuracy (0.965; 95% CI, 0.942-0.985), outperforming all GPT-5-nano\nvariants (P < .001), o1-high (P = .04), and GPT-4o (P < .001), but not o3-high\n(0.958; 95% CI, 0.931-0.981). GPT-5-high ranked first in both accuracy (1.66x\nstronger than o3-high) and rationale quality (1.11x stronger than o3-high).\nCost-accuracy analysis identified several GPT-5 configurations on the Pareto\nfrontier, with GPT-5-mini-low offering the most favorable low-cost,\nhigh-performance balance.

Real-world data often\ncontains complex background noise and inherent misalignment between text\ndescriptions and image content, whereas synthetic images offer pure backgrounds\nand long-tailed supervision signals, facilitating more accurate text-to-image\nalignment.

To address the challenges, we focus on a trustworthy RRG model, which\nnot only generates accurate descriptions of abnormalities, but also provides\nbasis of its predictions. To this end, we propose a framework named chain of\ndiagnosis (CoD), which maintains a chain of diagnostic process for clinically\naccurate and explainable RRG.

While recent\nadvancements have achieved photorealistic renderings and plausible animation,\nhead editing, especially real-time appearance editing, remains challenging due\nto the implicit representation and entangled modeling of the geometry and\nglobal appearance. To address this, we propose Surface-Volumetric Gaussian Head\nAvatar (SVG-Head), a novel hybrid representation that explicitly models the\ngeometry with 3D Gaussians bound on a FLAME mesh and leverages disentangled\ntexture images to capture the global appearance. Technically, it contains two\ntypes of Gaussians, in which surface Gaussians explicitly model the appearance\nof head avatars using learnable texture images, facilitating real-time texture\nediting, while volumetric Gaussians enhance the reconstruction quality of\nnon-Lambertian regions (e.g., lips and hair). To model the correspondence\nbetween 3D world and texture space, we provide a mesh-aware Gaussian UV mapping\nmethod, which leverages UV coordinates given by the FLAME mesh to obtain sharp\ntexture images and real-time rendering speed. A hierarchical optimization\nstrategy is further designed to pursue the optimal performance in both\nreconstruction quality and editing flexibility.

Knowledge Distillation (KD) has been\nexplored to narrow this gap, but existing methods mainly enlarge the student\nmodel by mimicking the teacher's architecture, leading to higher inference\ncost. To address this issue, we introduce BridgeTA, a cost-effective\ndistillation framework to bridge the representation gap between LC fusion and\nCamera-only models through a Teacher Assistant (TA) network while keeping the\nstudent's architecture and inference cost unchanged. A lightweight TA network\ncombines the BEV representations of the teacher and student, creating a shared\nlatent space that serves as an intermediate representation.

While RANSAC is a robust strategy with strong probabilistic\nguarantees, the ambiguity of its inlier threshold criterion makes it\nsusceptible to false positive plane detections. This issue is particularly\nprevalent in complex real-world scenes, where the true number of planes is\nunknown and multiple planes coexist. In this paper, we aim to address this\nlimitation by proposing a generalised framework for plane detection based on\nmodel information optimization. Building on previous works, we treat the\nobserved depth readings as discrete random variables, with their probability\ndistributions constrained by the ground truth planes. Various models containing\ndifferent candidate plane constraints are then generated through repeated\nrandom sub-sampling to explain our observations. By incorporating the physics\nand noise model of the depth sensor, we can calculate the information for each\nmodel, and the model with the least information is accepted as the most likely\nground truth. This information optimization process serves as an objective\nmechanism for determining the true number of planes and preventing false\npositive detections. Additionally, the quality of each detected plane can be\nranked by summing the information reduction of inlier points for each plane.

Recently, latent\ndiffusion model (LDM) are applied for harmonization, achieving remarkable\nresults. However, LDM-based harmonization faces challenges in detail\npreservation and limited harmonization ability. Additionally, current synthetic\ndatasets rely on color transfer, which lacks local variations and fails to\ncapture complex real-world lighting conditions. To enhance harmonization\ncapabilities, we propose the Region-to-Region transformation. By injecting\ninformation from appropriate regions into the foreground, this approach\npreserves original details while achieving image harmonization or, conversely,\ngenerating new composite data. From this perspective, We propose a novel model\nR2R. Specifically, we design Clear-VAE to preserve high-frequency details in\nthe foreground using Adaptive Filter while eliminating disharmonious elements.\nTo further enhance harmonization, we introduce the Harmony Controller with\nMask-aware Adaptive Channel Attention (MACA), which dynamically adjusts the\nforeground based on the channel importance of both foreground and background\nregions. To address the limitation of existing datasets, we propose Random\nPoisson Blending, which transfers color and lighting information from a\nsuitable region to the foreground, thereby generating more diverse and\nchallenging synthetic images.

Our method\nthus learns to establish correspondences across regions where their surface\nshapes appear identical but their volumes occupy the inverted space to each\nother. To facilitate this process, we also learn to align regions in rotation\nby estimating their shape orientations via equivariant neural networks.

Unlike existing coordinate-based methods which are often\ncomputationally intensive when rendering explicit surfaces, our proposed\nmethod, named RayletDF, introduces a new technique called raylet distance\nfield, which aims to directly predict surface points from query rays. Our\npipeline consists of three key modules: a raylet feature extractor, a raylet\ndistance field predictor, and a multi-raylet blender.

To address\nthese issues, recent works have proposed training-free compression methods.\nHowever, existing efforts often suffer from three major limitations: (1)\nCurrent approaches do not decompose techniques into comparable modules,\nhindering fair evaluation across spatial and temporal redundancy. (2)\nEvaluation confined to simple single-turn tasks, failing to reflect performance\nin realistic scenarios. (3) Isolated use of individual compression techniques,\nwithout exploring their joint potential. To overcome these gaps, we introduce\nLLMC+, a comprehensive VLM compression benchmark with a versatile,\nplug-and-play toolkit. LLMC+ supports over 20 algorithms across five\nrepresentative VLM families and enables systematic study of token-level and\nmodel-level compression.

Existing methods narrowly focus on subject\nidentity, overlooking key aspects of visual storytelling such as spatial\ncomposition, background evolution, and narrative pacing. To address this, we\nintroduce a lightweight consistency framework composed of two components:\nLatent Panel Anchoring, which preserves a shared character reference across\npanels, and Reciprocal Attention Value Mixing, which softly blends visual\nfeatures between token pairs with strong reciprocal attention. Together, these\nmechanisms enhance coherence without architectural changes or fine-tuning,\nenabling state-of-the-art diffusion models to generate visually diverse yet\nconsistent storyboards. To structure generation, we use an off-the-shelf\nlanguage model to convert free-form stories into grounded panel-level prompts.\nTo evaluate, we propose the Rich Storyboard Benchmark, a suite of open-domain\nnarratives designed to assess layout diversity and background-grounded\nstorytelling, in addition to consistency. We also introduce a new Scene\nDiversity metric that quantifies spatial and pose variation across storyboards.\nOur qualitative and quantitative results, as well as a user study, show that\nStory2Board produces more dynamic, coherent, and narratively engaging\nstoryboards than existing baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Story2Board\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u5bcc\u6709\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\u677f\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u53d9\u4e8b\u5173\u952e\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5982\u7a7a\u95f4\u6784\u56fe\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u6f14\u53d8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5173\u6ce8\u4e3b\u4f53\u8eab\u4efd\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u53d9\u4e8b\u4e2d\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u6784\u56fe\u3001\u80cc\u666f\u6f14\u53d8\u548c\u53d9\u4e8b\u8282\u594f\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6f5c\u5728\u9762\u677f\u951a\u5b9a\uff08\u4fdd\u6301\u89d2\u8272\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\u548c\u4e92\u60e0\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u503c\u6df7\u5408\uff08\u8f6f\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\uff09\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u73b0\u6210\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u6545\u4e8b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u9762\u677f\u7ea7\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728Rich Storyboard Benchmark\u4e0a\uff0cStory2Board\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\u677f\u5728\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u5e03\u5c40\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u53d9\u4e8b\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "Story2Board\u65e0\u9700\u67b6\u6784\u66f4\u6539\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5373\u53ef\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u8fde\u8d2f\u4e14\u53d9\u4e8b\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\u677f\u3002"}}
