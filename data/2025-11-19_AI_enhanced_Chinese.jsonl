However, when unknown samples are semantically similar to known classes, inter-class overlap in the feature space often causes models to assign unjustifiably high confidence to them, leading to misclassification as known classes -- a phenomenon known as overconfidence. This overconfidence undermines OSR by blurring the decision boundary between known and unknown classes. To address this issue, we propose a framework that explicitly mitigates overconfidence caused by inter-class overlap. The framework consists of two components: a perturbation-based uncertainty estimation module, which applies controllable parameter perturbations to generate diverse predictions and quantify predictive uncertainty, and an unknown detection module with distinct learning-based classifiers, implemented as a two-stage procedure, which leverages the estimated uncertainty to improve discrimination between known and unknown classes, thereby enhancing OSR performance. Experimental results on three public datasets show that the proposed framework achieves superior performance over existing OSR methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u89e3\u51b3\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u6270\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6539\u5584\u5df2\u77e5\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u533a\u5206\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f53\u672a\u77e5\u6837\u672c\u4e0e\u5df2\u77e5\u7c7b\u522b\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u65f6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5f80\u5f80\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u6837\u672c\u8d4b\u4e88\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u4e3a\u5df2\u77e5\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u79f0\u4e3a\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\uff0c\u4f1a\u6a21\u7cca\u5df2\u77e5\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u7c7b\u522b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "method": "\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u63a7\u53c2\u6570\u6270\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u672a\u77e5\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\u5df2\u77e5\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u533a\u5206\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u7f13\u89e3\u7531\u7c7b\u522b\u95f4\u91cd\u53e0\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This task presents key challenges, including maintaining temporal consistency across frames affected by occlusion and appearance variations, and achieving novel object generalization without relying on complex region proposals, which are often computationally expensive and require task-specific training. Our novel object-aware temporal modeling approach addresses these challenges by incorporating a filtering mechanism that selectively propagates high-confidence object features across frames. This enables efficient feature progression, reduces noise accumulation, and enhances detection accuracy in a few-shot setting. By utilizing few-shot trained detection and classification heads with focused feature propagation, we achieve robust temporal consistency without depending on explicit object tube proposals. Our approach achieves performance gains, with AP improvements of 3.7% (FSVOD-500), 5.3% (FSYTV-40), 4.3% (VidOR), and 4.5 (VidVRD) in the 5-shot setting.

While generative methods provide a unified modeling perspective, they often suffer from slow inference due to the complex sampling trajectories from noise to image. To address this, we formulate image fusion as a direct probabilistic transport from source modalities to the fused image distribution, leveraging the flow matching paradigm to improve sampling efficiency and structural consistency. To mitigate the lack of high-quality fused images for supervision, we collect fusion results from multiple state-of-the-art models as priors, and employ a task-aware selection function to select the most reliable pseudo-labels for each task. We further introduce a Fusion Refiner module that employs a divide-and-conquer strategy to systematically identify, decompose, and enhance degraded components in selected pseudo-labels. For multi-task scenarios, we integrate elastic weight consolidation and experience replay mechanisms to preserve cross-task performance and enhance continual learning ability from both parameter stability and memory retention perspectives. Our approach achieves competitive performance across diverse fusion tasks, while significantly improving sampling efficiency and maintaining a lightweight model design.

With watermarking, we can always accurately detect LLM-generated texts. However, recent findings suggest that these techniques often negatively affect the quality of the generated texts, and adversarial attacks can strip the watermarking signals, causing the texts to possibly evade detection. These findings have created resistance in the wide adoption of watermarking by LLM creators. Finally, to encourage adoption, we evaluate the robustness of several watermarking techniques to adversarial attacks by comparing paraphrasing and back translation (i.e., English $\\to$ another language $\\to$ English) attacks; and their ability to preserve quality and writing style of the unwatermarked texts by using linguistic metrics to capture quality and writing style of texts. Our results suggest that these watermarking techniques preserve semantics, deviate from the writing style of the unwatermarked texts, and are susceptible to adversarial attacks, especially for the back translation attack.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6280\u672f\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u504f\u79bb\u539f\u59cb\u6587\u672c\u7684\u5199\u4f5c\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u4e14\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u56de\u8bd1\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5371\u5bb3\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u5b58\u5728\u6587\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u6613\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u91ca\u4e49\u548c\u56de\u8bd1\uff08\u82f1\u8bed\u2192\u5176\u4ed6\u8bed\u8a00\u2192\u82f1\u8bed\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u6807\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6c34\u5370\u6587\u672c\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5199\u4f5c\u98ce\u683c\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u504f\u79bb\u672a\u52a0\u6c34\u5370\u6587\u672c\u7684\u5199\u4f5c\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u56de\u8bd1\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5199\u4f5c\u98ce\u683c\u4fdd\u6301\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u56de\u8bd1\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u62b5\u6297\u529b\u8f83\u5f31\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

To address the limitations associated with trajectory acquisition and vehicle tracking, road segment maps recording the individual-level traffic dynamic data were directly served in crash detection. A novel two-stage trajectory-free crash detection framework, was present to generate the rational future road segment map and identify crashes. The first-stage diffusion-based segment map generation model, Mapfusion, conducts a noisy-to-normal process that progressively adds noise to the road segment map until the map is corrupted to pure Gaussian noise. The denoising process is guided by sequential embedding components capturing the temporal dynamics of segment map sequences. Furthermore, the generation model is designed to incorporate background context through ControlNet to enhance generation control. Crash detection is achieved by comparing the monitored segment map with the generations from diffusion model in second stage. Trained on non-crash vehicle motion data, Mapfusion successfully generates realistic road segment evolution maps based on learned motion patterns and remains robust across different sampling intervals. Experiments on real-world crashes indicate the effectiveness of the proposed two-stage method in accurately detecting crashes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65e0\u8f68\u8ff9\u78b0\u649e\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5408\u7406\u7684\u672a\u6765\u8def\u6bb5\u5730\u56fe\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u78b0\u649e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u76d1\u63a7\u8def\u6bb5\u5730\u56fe\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u5730\u56fe\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u78b0\u649e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u65f6\u78b0\u649e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b89\u5168\u7ba1\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ea4\u901a\u6548\u7387\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8f68\u8ff9\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u8f66\u8f86\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u8def\u6bb5\u5730\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578bMapfusion\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u566a\u58f0\u5230\u6b63\u5e38\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\u8def\u6bb5\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u76d1\u63a7\u5730\u56fe\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u5730\u56fe\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u78b0\u649e\u3002", "result": "Mapfusion\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u8def\u6bb5\u6f14\u5316\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u91c7\u6837\u95f4\u9694\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u78b0\u649e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u78b0\u649e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u78b0\u649e\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u78b0\u649e\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, seismic data presents unique characteristics that require specialized processing techniques for pretraining foundation models in seismic contexts with high- and low-frequency features playing crucial roles. Existing vision transformers (ViTs) with sequential tokenization ignore the intrinsic pattern and fail to grasp both the high- and low-frequency seismic information efficiently and effectively. This work introduces a novel adaptive two-grid foundation model training strategy (ADATG) with Hilbert encoding specifically tailored for seismogram data, leveraging the hierarchical structures inherent in seismic data. Specifically, our approach employs spectrum decomposition to separate high- and low-frequency components and utilizes hierarchical Hilbert encoding to represent the data effectively. Moreover, observing the frequency principle observed in ViTs, we propose an adaptive training strategy that initially emphasizes coarse-level information and then progressively refines the model's focus on fine-level features. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our training methods.

We investigate a simple training-free approach - QE-informed Retranslation, and compare it with another within the same training-free paradigm.

This enables unscripted, in the wild video analysis at scale to capture natural facial behaviors, transferrable across devices, topics, and cultures without active intervention by clinicians or researchers during recording. Most existing resources prioritize speech or scripted interviews, limiting use outside clinics and coupling predictions to language and transcription. In contrast, we identify and analyze whether temporal facial kinematics, including blink dynamics, small mouth jaw motions, gaze variability, and subtle head adjustments, are sufficient for dementia screening without speech or text. By stabilizing facial signals, we convert these micro movements into interpretable facial microdynamic time series, smooth them, and summarize short windows into compact clip level statistics for screening. Each window is encoded by its activity mix (the relative share of motion across streams), thus the predictor analyzes the distribution of motion across streams rather than its magnitude, making per channel effects transparent. We also introduce YT DemTalk, a new dataset curated from publicly available, in the wild camera facing videos. It contains 300 clips (150 with self reported dementia, 150 controls) to test our model and offer a first benchmarking of the corpus. On YT DemTalk, ablations identify gaze lability and mouth/jaw dynamics as the most informative cues, and light weighted shallow classifiers could attain a dementia prediction performance of (AUROC) 0.953, 0.961 Average Precision (AP), 0.851 F1-score, and 0.857 accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9762\u90e8\u5fae\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u7684\u88ab\u52a8\u75f4\u5446\u7b5b\u67e5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u7728\u773c\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u5634\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u6ce8\u89c6\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u5934\u90e8\u5fae\u8c03\u7b49\u9762\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bed\u8a00\u6216\u6587\u672c\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e9\u671f\u795e\u7ecf\u8ba4\u77e5\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u75f4\u5446\u7b5b\u67e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u97f3\u6216\u811a\u672c\u5316\u8bbf\u8c08\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u5916\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u8f6c\u5f55\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u53ef\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u88ab\u52a8\u7b5b\u67e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7a33\u5b9a\u9762\u90e8\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5c06\u9762\u90e8\u5fae\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u5fae\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5e73\u6ed1\u5904\u7406\u540e\u5c06\u77ed\u7a97\u53e3\u6c47\u603b\u4e3a\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u7247\u6bb5\u7ea7\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7a97\u53e3\u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u6d3b\u52a8\u6df7\u5408\uff08\u8de8\u8fd0\u52a8\u6d41\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u8fd0\u52a8\u4efd\u989d\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u5e03\u800c\u975e\u5e45\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728YT DemTalk\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08300\u4e2a\u7247\u6bb5\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6ce8\u89c6\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5634\u90e8/\u4e0b\u988c\u52a8\u6001\u662f\u6700\u5177\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u7684\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0AUROC 0.953\u3001AP 0.961\u3001F1\u5206\u6570 0.851\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7387 0.857\u7684\u75f4\u5446\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9762\u90e8\u5fae\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u75f4\u5446\u7b5b\u67e5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u53d7\u8bbe\u5907\u3001\u8bdd\u9898\u548c\u6587\u5316\u9650\u5236\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u88ab\u52a8\u7b5b\u67e5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

To study the impact of this phenomenon in a real-world application setting, we introduce GM-Extract, a novel benchmark dataset meticulously designed to evaluate LLM performance on retrieval of control variables. To accurately diagnose failure modes, we propose a simple yet elegant evaluation system using two distinct metrics: one for spatial retrieval capability (Document Metric) and the other for semantic retrieval capability (Variable Extraction Metric). We conduct a systematic evaluation of 7-8B parameter models on two multi-document tasks (key-value extraction and question-answering), demonstrating a significant change in retrieval performance simply by altering how the data is represented in the context window. While a distinct U-shaped curve was not consistently observed, our analysis reveals a clear pattern of performance across models, which we further correlate with perplexity scores. Furthermore, we perform a literature survey of mitigation methods, which we categorize into two distinct approaches: black-box and white-box methods. We then apply these techniques to our benchmark, finding that their efficacy is highly nuanced.

Gen-ViRe: A Generative Visual Reasoning Benchmark", "comment": "10 pages", "summary": "While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables sophisticated symbolic reasoning in LLMs, it remains confined to discrete text and cannot simulate the continuous, physics-governed dynamics of the real world. Recent video generation models have emerged as potential world simulators through Chain-of-Frames (CoF) reasoning -- materializing thought as frame-by-frame visual sequences, with each frame representing a physically-grounded reasoning step. Despite compelling demonstrations, a challenge persists: existing benchmarks, focusing on fidelity or alignment, do not assess CoF reasoning and thus cannot measure core cognitive abilities in multi-step planning, algorithmic logic, or abstract pattern extrapolation. This evaluation void prevents systematic understanding of model capabilities and principled guidance for improvement. We introduce Gen-ViRe (Generative Visual Reasoning Benchmark), a framework grounded in cognitive science and real-world AI applications, which decomposes CoF reasoning into six cognitive dimensions -- from perceptual logic to abstract planning -- and 24 subtasks. Through multi-source data curation, minimal prompting protocols, and hybrid VLM-assisted evaluation with detailed criteria, Gen-ViRe delivers the first quantitative assessment of video models as reasoners. Our experiments on SOTA systems reveal substantial discrepancies between impressive visual quality and actual reasoning depth, establishing baselines and diagnostic tools to advance genuine world simulators.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Gen-ViRe\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u94fe\u5f0f\u5e27\u63a8\u7406(CoF)\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u65e0\u6cd5\u8861\u91cf\u591a\u6b65\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u7b97\u6cd5\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u62bd\u8c61\u6a21\u5f0f\u5916\u63a8\u7b49\u6838\u5fc3\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6216\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u94fe\u5f0f\u5e27\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u5b9e\u9645AI\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5c06CoF\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a6\u4e2a\u8ba4\u77e5\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c24\u4e2a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u6574\u7406\u3001\u6700\u5c0f\u63d0\u793a\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u6df7\u5408VLM\u8f85\u52a9\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9SOTA\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a8\u8fdb\u771f\u6b63\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "conclusion": "Gen-ViRe\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u5668\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Inspired by this, we propose the novel task of Collision Sound Source Segmentation (CS3), where we aim to segment the objects responsible for a collision sound in visual input (i.e. video frames from the collision clip), conditioned on the audio. This task presents unique challenges. Unlike isolated sound events, a collision sound arises from interactions between two objects, and the acoustic signature of the collision depends on both. We focus on egocentric video, where sounds are often clear, but the visual scene is cluttered, objects are small, and interactions are brief.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a weakly-supervised method for audio-conditioned segmentation, utilising foundation models (CLIP and SAM2).

However, existing OOC misinformation detection methods tend to emphasize the role of internal consistency, ignoring the significant of external consistency between image-text pairs and external evidence. In this paper, we propose HiEAG, a novel Hierarchical Evidence-Augmented Generation framework to refine external consistency checking through leveraging the extensive knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our approach decomposes external consistency checking into a comprehensive engine pipeline, which integrates reranking and rewriting, apart from retrieval. Evidence reranking module utilizes Automatic Evidence Selection Prompting (AESP) that acquires the relevant evidence item from the products of evidence retrieval. Subsequently, evidence rewriting module leverages Automatic Evidence Generation Prompting (AEGP) to improve task adaptation on MLLM-based OOC misinformation detectors.

Recent adaptations using domain-specific encoders, such as PubMedBERT or ClinicalBERT, mitigate this issue by leveraging medical corpora, but remain constrained by their limited input length (typically 512 tokens) and relatively shallow semantic understanding. To address these limitations, we propose QwenCLIP, a vision-language framework that replaces CLIP's text encoder with a large language model (LLM)-based embedding module (e.g., Qwen3-Embedding) and introduces learnable prompts to enhance cross-modal alignment. By leveraging the extended context window and richer representations of LLMs, QwenCLIP captures comprehensive medical semantics from long-form clinical text, substantially improving medical image-text alignment and downstream performance on radiology benchmarks.

Thousands of rare and zero-shot ICD codes are severely underrepresented in datasets like MIMIC-III, leading to low macro-F1 scores. In this work, we propose a data-centric framework that generates high-quality synthetic discharge summaries to mitigate this imbalance. Our method constructs realistic multi-label code sets anchored on rare codes by leveraging real-world co-occurrence patterns, ICD descriptions, synonyms, taxonomy, and similar clinical notes. Using these structured prompts, we generate 90,000 synthetic notes covering 7,902 ICD codes, significantly expanding the training distribution. We fine-tune two state-of-the-art transformer-based models, PLM-ICD and GKI-ICD, on both the original and extended datasets.

The proposed model is differentiated from traditional transfer learning methods as it incorporates a Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer along with a Sparsity-Induced Feature Reduction Layer that forms a multi-tiered framework, further improving feature selection and representation. The Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer makes smart variations of feature weights, with more detailed anatomical features, which are mostly left out in a transfer learning setup. In addition, the Sparsity-Induced Layer removes redundancy for learned features, producing lean yet robust representations for pathology in the lumbar spine. This architecture is novel as it overcomes the constraints in the traditional transfer learning approach, especially in the high-dimensional context of medical images, and achieves a significant performance boost, reaching a precision of 0.9, recall of 0.861, F1 score of 0.88, loss of 0.18, and an accuracy of 88.1%, compared to the baseline model, EfficientNet.

However, these approaches often depend on handcrafted prompts and suffer from inconsistent performance, limiting their robustness and generalization in real-world scenarios. In this work, we evaluate state-of-the-art open-source VLMs on high-level decision-making tasks using ego-view visual inputs and identify critical limitations in their ability to deliver reliable, context-aware decisions. Motivated by these observations, we propose a new approach that shifts the role of VLMs from direct decision generators to semantic enhancers. Specifically, we leverage their strong general scene understanding to enrich existing vision-based benchmarks with structured, linguistically rich scene descriptions.

KGs are structured representations of factual knowledge consisting of entities and relations. Due to the high construction cost, they had been regarded as static databases with validated links. However, the recent development of Transformer-based relation extraction (RE) methods has enabled us to generate KGs dynamically by giving them natural language texts, and thereby opened the possibility for representing the meaning of the input sentences with the created KGs. Using this effect, we propose a method that answers MCQs in the \"fill-in-the-blank\" format, taking care of the point that RE methods generate KGs that represent false information if provided with factually incorrect texts. We measure the truthfulness of each question sentence by (i) converting the sentence into a relational graph using an RE method and (ii) verifying it against factually correct KGs under the closed-world assumption. The experimental results demonstrate that our method correctly answers up to around 70% of the questions, while providing traceability of the procedure. We also highlight that the question category has a vast influence on the accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5339\u914d\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u56de\u7b54\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f93\u51fa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\u53e5\u5b50\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u7ea670%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6784\u5efa\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6587\u672c\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u8868\u793a\u8f93\u5165\u53e5\u5b50\u7684\u542b\u4e49\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\u53e5\u5b50\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u56de\u7b54\u586b\u7a7a\u5f0f\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u9898\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u5173\u7cfb\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u53e5\u5b50\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5173\u7cfb\u56fe\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u5c01\u95ed\u4e16\u754c\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u4e0e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4ee5\u8861\u91cf\u6bcf\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u53e5\u5b50\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6b63\u786e\u56de\u7b54\u7ea670%\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\u95ee\u9898\u7c7b\u522b\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408Transformer\u5173\u7cfb\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5339\u914d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u56de\u7b54\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u95ee\u9898\u7c7b\u522b\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

To alleviate the issue of lacking high-quality data for model alignment, some works on weak-to-strong generalization (W2SG) finetune a strong pretrained model with a weak supervisor so that it can generalize beyond weak supervision. However, the invariable use of weak supervision in existing methods exposes issues in robustness, with a proportion of weak labels proving harmful to models. In this paper, we propose a selective W2SG framework to avoid using weak supervision when unnecessary. We train a binary classifier P(IK) to identify questions that a strong model can answer and use its self-generated labels for alignment. We further refine weak labels with a graph smoothing method. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms competitive baselines. Further analyses show that P(IK) can generalize across tasks and difficulties, which indicates selective W2SG can help superalignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5f31\u5230\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8bc6\u522b\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u5730\u4f7f\u7528\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u56fe\u5e73\u6ed1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u5f31\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8d85\u4eba\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5f31\u5230\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u56fa\u5b9a\u4f7f\u7528\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u5b58\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u5f31\u6807\u7b7e\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u5bb3\u3002", "method": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u5668P(IK)\u8bc6\u522b\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5176\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u6807\u7b7e\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u5e73\u6ed1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u5f31\u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ade\u4e89\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0cP(IK)\u80fd\u591f\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u96be\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5f31\u5230\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8d85\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u907f\u514d\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u5730\u4f7f\u7528\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Yet, we lack a clear understanding of where these symbolic hallucinations originate, making it crucial to systematically handle such triggers and localize the emergence of hallucination inside the model. While prior work explored localization using statistical techniques like LSC and activation variance analysis, these methods treat all tokens equally and overlook the role symbolic linguistic knowledge plays in triggering hallucinations. So far, no approach has investigated how symbolic elements specifically drive hallucination failures across model layers, nor has symbolic linguistic knowledge been used as the foundation for a localization framework. We propose the first symbolic localization framework that leverages symbolic linguistic and semantic knowledge to meaningfully trace the development of hallucinations across all model layers. By focusing on how models process symbolic triggers, we analyze five models using HaluEval and TruthfulQA. Our symbolic knowledge approach reveals that attention variance for these linguistic elements explodes to critical instability in early layers (2-4), with negation triggering catastrophic variance levels, demonstrating that symbolic semantic processing breaks down from the very beginning. Through the lens of symbolic linguistic knowledge, despite larger model sizes, hallucination rates remain consistently high (78.3%-83.7% across Gemma variants), with steep attention drops for symbolic semantic triggers throughout deeper layers. Our findings demonstrate that hallucination is fundamentally a symbolic linguistic processing failure, not a general generation problem, revealing that symbolic semantic knowledge provides the key to understanding and localizing hallucination mechanisms in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b26\u53f7\u8bed\u8a00\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u7b26\u53f7\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\uff08\u5982\u4fee\u9970\u8bed\u3001\u5426\u5b9a\u3001\u6570\u5b57\u7b49\uff09\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5404\u5c42\u7684\u5904\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u7b26\u53f7\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u5931\u8d25\u800c\u975e\u4e00\u822c\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7b26\u53f7\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u65f6\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7b26\u53f7\u5e7b\u89c9\u8d77\u6e90\u7684\u6e05\u6670\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u7b26\u53f7\u8bed\u8a00\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u5904\u7406\u7b26\u53f7\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u5e76\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5e7b\u89c9\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b26\u53f7\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528HaluEval\u548cTruthfulQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5206\u6790\u4e94\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u5904\u7406\u7b26\u53f7\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u5dee\u5206\u6790\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5e7b\u89c9\u5728\u5404\u5c42\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "result": "\u7b26\u53f7\u8bed\u8a00\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u5dee\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\uff082-4\u5c42\uff09\u7206\u70b8\u6027\u589e\u957f\u81f3\u4e34\u754c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5426\u5b9a\u89e6\u53d1\u707e\u96be\u6027\u65b9\u5dee\u6c34\u5e73\uff1b\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u4f4d\uff0878.3%-83.7%\uff09\uff0c\u6df1\u5c42\u4e2d\u7b26\u53f7\u8bed\u4e49\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e7b\u89c9\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u7b26\u53f7\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4e00\u822c\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7b26\u53f7\u8bed\u4e49\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4dLLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Their short temporal cycles increase the difficulty in automatically detecting them using classical computer vision approaches and remote sensing. Also, due to scarcity of and the difficulty in producing accurate labeled data, automatic detection of ephemeral gullies using Machine Learning is limited to zero-shot approaches which are hard to implement. To overcome these challenges, we present the first weakly supervised pipeline for detection of ephemeral gullies. Our method relies on remote sensing and uses Vision Language Models (VLMs) to drastically reduce the labor-intensive task of manual labeling. In order to achieve that, the method exploits: 1) the knowledge embedded in the VLM's pretraining; 2) a teacher-student model where the teacher learns from noisy labels coming from the VLMs, and the student learns by weak supervision using teacher-generate labels and a noise-aware loss function. We also make available the first-of-its-kind dataset for semi-supervised detection of ephemeral gully from remote-sensed images. The dataset consists of a number of locations labeled by a group of soil and plant scientists, as well as a large number of unlabeled locations. The dataset represent more than 18,000 high-resolution remote-sensing images obtained over the course of 13 years. Our experimental results demonstrate the validity of our approach by showing superior performances compared to VLMs and the label model itself when using weak supervision to train an student model.

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential for enhancing EL performance. Prior research has leveraged LLMs to improve entity disambiguation and input representation, yielding significant gains in accuracy and robustness. However, these approaches typically apply LLMs to isolated stages of the EL task, failing to fully integrate their capabilities throughout the entire process.\n  In this work, we introduce DeepEL, a comprehensive framework that incorporates LLMs into every stage of the entity linking task. Furthermore, we identify that disambiguating entities in isolation is insufficient for optimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel self-validation mechanism that utilizes global contextual information, enabling LLMs to rectify their own predictions and better recognize cohesive relationships among entities within the same sentence.\n  Extensive empirical evaluation across ten benchmark datasets demonstrates that DeepEL substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average improvement of 2.6\\% in overall F1 score and a remarkable 4% gain on out-of-domain datasets.

Arabic has a complicated morphological and syntactic structure, posing a greater challenge than other languages. Even though modern neural models have improved greatly in recent years, the majority of previous attempts used individual models without taking into account the potential benefits of combining different systems. In this paper, we present one of the first multi-system approaches for correcting grammatical errors in Arabic, the Arab Enhanced Edit Selection System Complication (ArbESC+). Several models are used to collect correction proposals, which are represented as numerical features in the framework. A classifier determines and implements the appropriate corrections based on these features. In order to improve output quality, the framework uses support techniques to filter overlapping corrections and estimate decision reliability. A combination of AraT5, ByT5, mT5, AraBART, AraBART+Morph+GEC, and Text editing systems gave better results than a single model alone, with F0.5 at 82.63% on QALB-14 test data, 84.64% on QALB-15 L1 data, and 65.55% on QALB-15 L2 data. As one of the most significant contributions of this work, it's the first Arab attempt to integrate linguistic error correction. Improving existing models provides a practical step towards developing advanced tools that will benefit users and researchers of Arabic text processing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u8bed\u6cd5\u9519\u8bef\u6821\u6b63\u7684\u591a\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5ArbESC+\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u4fee\u6b63\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u5728QALB\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u5177\u6709\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u53e5\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6bd4\u5176\u5b83\u8bed\u8a00\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u867d\u7136\u73b0\u4ee3\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u6709\u5f88\u5927\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f46\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u8003\u8651\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faArbESC+\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff08AraT5\u3001ByT5\u3001mT5\u3001AraBART\u7b49\uff09\u6536\u96c6\u4fee\u6b63\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u6570\u503c\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u786e\u5b9a\u5e76\u5b9e\u65bd\u9002\u5f53\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u652f\u6301\u6280\u672f\u8fc7\u6ee4\u91cd\u53e0\u4fee\u6b63\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u51b3\u7b56\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728QALB-14\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u4e0aF0.5\u8fbe\u523082.63%\uff0c\u5728QALB-15 L1\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523084.64%\uff0c\u5728QALB-15 L2\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523065.55%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u6574\u5408\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u8bed\u8a00\u9519\u8bef\u6821\u6b63\u7684\u5c1d\u8bd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u6587\u672c\u5904\u7406\u5de5\u5177\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5c06\u60e0\u53ca\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u7528\u6237\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u3002"}}

A central task is Multi-Camera Vehicle Tracking (MCVT), which generates vehicle trajectories and enables applications such as anomaly detection, traffic density estimation, and suspect vehicle tracking. However, most existing studies on MCVT emphasize accuracy while overlooking real-time performance and scalability. These two aspects are essential for real-world deployment and become increasingly challenging in city-scale applications as the number of cameras grows. To address this issue, we propose SAE-MCVT, the first scalable real-time MCVT framework. The system includes several edge devices that interact with one central workstation separately. On the edge side, live RTSP video streams are serialized and processed through modules including object detection, object tracking, geo-mapping, and feature extraction. Only lightweight metadata -- vehicle locations and deep appearance features -- are transmitted to the central workstation. On the central side, cross-camera association is calculated under the constraint of spatial-temporal relations between adjacent cameras, which are learned through a self-supervised camera link model. Experiments on the RoundaboutHD dataset show that SAE-MCVT maintains real-time operation on 2K 15 FPS video streams and achieves an IDF1 score of 61.2.

We address this by constructing a large, music-related natural language corpus (40B tokens) that combines open source and in-house data, and by implementing a domain-first data pipeline: a lightweight classifier filters and weights in-domain text, followed by multi-stage cleaning, de-duplication, and privacy-preserving masking. We further integrate multi-source music text with associated metadata to form a broader, better-structured foundation of domain knowledge. On the training side, we introduce reference-model (RM)-based token-level soft scoring for quality control: a unified loss-ratio criterion is used both for data selection and for dynamic down-weighting during optimization, reducing noise gradients and amplifying task-aligned signals, thereby enabling more effective music-domain continued pretraining and alignment.

Existing approaches simulate a simplified workflow where actors dub directly without preparation, overlooking the critical director-actor interaction. In contrast, authentic workflows involve a dynamic collaboration: directors actively engage with actors, guiding them to internalize the context cues, specifically emotion, before performance. To address this issue, we propose a new Retrieve-Augmented Director-Actor Interaction Learning scheme to achieve authentic movie dubbing, termed Authentic-Dubber, which contains three novel mechanisms: (1) We construct a multimodal Reference Footage library to simulate the learning footage provided by directors. Note that we integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve deep comprehension of emotional representations across multimodal signals. (2) To emulate how actors efficiently and comprehensively internalize director-provided footage during dubbing, we propose an Emotion-Similarity-based Retrieval-Augmentation strategy. This strategy retrieves the most relevant multimodal information that aligns with the target silent video. (3) We develop a Progressive Graph-based speech generation approach that incrementally incorporates the retrieved multimodal emotional knowledge, thereby simulating the actor's final dubbing process. The above mechanisms enable the Authentic-Dubber to faithfully replicate the authentic dubbing workflow, achieving comprehensive improvements in emotional expressiveness. Both subjective and objective evaluations on the V2C Animation benchmark dataset validate the effectiveness.

However, we find that reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuned CoT reasoning can paradoxically degrade performance in Visual Grounding tasks, particularly as CoT outputs become lengthy or complex. Additionally, our analysis reveals that increased dataset size does not always enhance performance due to varying data complexities. Motivated by these findings, we propose Curriculum-based Relative Policy Optimization (CuRPO), a novel training strategy that leverages CoT length and generalized Intersection over Union (gIoU) rewards as complexity indicators to progressively structure training data from simpler to more challenging examples. Extensive experiments on RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and LISA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. CuRPO consistently outperforms existing methods, including Visual-RFT, with notable improvements of up to +12.52 mAP on RefCOCO. Moreover, CuRPO exhibits exceptional efficiency and robustness, delivering strong localization performance even in few-shot learning scenarios, particularly benefiting tasks characterized by ambiguous and intricate textual descriptions.The code is released on https://github.com/qyoung-yan/CuRPO.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCuRPO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u7684CoT\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684CoT\u63a8\u7406\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f1a\u968f\u7740CoT\u8f93\u51fa\u53d8\u957f\u6216\u590d\u6742\u800c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e14\u589e\u52a0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89c4\u6a21\u5e76\u4e0d\u603b\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316(CuRPO)\uff0c\u5229\u7528CoT\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u5e7f\u4e49\u4ea4\u5e76\u6bd4(gIoU)\u5956\u52b1\u4f5c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4ece\u7b80\u5355\u5230\u590d\u6742\u9010\u6b65\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728RefCOCO\u3001RefCOCO+\u3001RefCOCOg\u548cLISA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCuRPO\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728RefCOCO\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe+12.52 mAP\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "CuRPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u6a21\u7cca\u590d\u6742\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

We present AfriSpeech-MultiBench, the first domain-specific evaluation suite for over 100 African English accents across 10+ countries and seven application domains: Finance, Legal, Medical, General dialogue, Call Center, Named Entities and Hallucination Robustness. We benchmark a diverse range of open, closed, unimodal ASR and multimodal LLM-based speech recognition systems using both spontaneous and non-spontaneous speech conversation drawn from various open African accented English speech datasets. Our empirical analysis reveals systematic variation: open-source ASR models excels in spontaneous speech contexts but degrades on noisy, non-native dialogue; multimodal LLMs are more accent-robust yet struggle with domain-specific named entities; proprietary models deliver high accuracy on clean speech but vary significantly by country and domain. Models fine-tuned on African English achieve competitive accuracy with lower latency, a practical advantage for deployment, hallucinations still remain a big problem for most SOTA models.

Existing compression methods have achieved partial success but overlook a crucial phenomenon in the training process -- the entropy conflict. During compression training, entropy decreases, leading to shorter reasoning but limited exploration, while accuracy-oriented objectives increase entropy, lengthening reasoning chains. This can cause the model to get stuck in a local dilemma. Our analysis further reveals the origin of the entropy conflict: many high-entropy tokens are logical connectors that receive larger gradients and are encouraged under the performance objective, while the compression objective simultaneously penalizes these potentially redundant connectors. This opposing pressure creates a direct source of entropy conflict. To address these issues, we adopt an entropy-guided training framework.

Procedural Warm-Up for Vision Transformers", "comment": null, "summary": "Transformers show remarkable versatility across domains, suggesting the existence of inductive biases beneficial across modalities. In this work, we explore a new way to instil such generic biases in vision transformers (ViTs) by pretraining on procedurally-generated data devoid of visual or semantic content. We generate this data with simple algorithms such as formal grammars, so the results bear no relationship to either natural or synthetic images. We use this procedurally-generated data to pretrain ViTs in a warm-up phase that bypasses their visual patch embedding mechanisms, thus encouraging the models to internalise abstract computational priors. When followed by standard image-based training, this warm-up significantly improves data efficiency, convergence speed, and downstream performance. On ImageNet-1k for example, allocating just 1% of the training budget to procedural data improves final accuracy by over 1.7%. In terms of its effect on performance, 1% procedurally generated data is thus equivalent to 28% of the ImageNet-1k data.

With the strong generation capabilities of LLMs, research has focused on generating verbalized confidence. This is further enhanced by combining chain-of-thought reasoning, which provides logical and transparent estimation. However, how reasoning strategies affect the estimated confidence is still under-explored. In this work, we demonstrate that predicting a verbalized probability distribution can effectively encourage in-depth reasoning for confidence estimation. Intuitively, it requires an LLM to consider all candidates within the answer space instead of basing on a single guess, and to carefully assign confidence scores to meet the requirements of a distribution.

While existing works primarily focus on assessing how well LLMs adhere to user instructions, they often overlook scenarios where instructions contain conflicting constraints-a common occurrence in complex prompts. The behavior of LLMs under such conditions remains under-explored. To bridge this gap, we introduce ConInstruct, a benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs' ability to detect and resolve conflicts within user instructions. Using this dataset, we evaluate LLMs' conflict detection performance and analyze their conflict resolution behavior. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1) Most proprietary LLMs exhibit strong conflict detection capabilities, whereas among open-source models, only DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates similarly strong performance. DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-4.5-Sonnet achieve the highest average F1-scores at 91.5% and 87.3%, respectively, ranking first and second overall. (2) Despite their strong conflict detection abilities, LLMs rarely explicitly notify users about the conflicts or request clarification when faced with conflicting constraints.

Our CrossTrainer approach discovers skill-attributes, such as balance, control, and hand positioning -- whose meaning transcends the boundaries of any given sport, then trains a multimodal language model to generate actionable feedback for a novel video, e.g., \"lift hands more to generate more power\" as well as its proficiency level, e.g., early expert.

Its key features include: (1) High Originality and Contamination Resistance, with all questions newly created or substantially adapted to prevent test data leakage; (2) Cross-Disciplinary Focus, designed to assess models' ability to integrate knowledge and reason across scientific domains; (3) High-Fidelity Answers, prioritizing complex, open-ended answers involving multi-step reasoning and LaTeX-formatted expressions over simple multiple-choice questions; and (4) Rigorous Quality Control, employing a multi-stage process of expert peer review and adversarial testing to ensure question difficulty, scientific value, and correctness. We also propose a robust evaluation paradigm using a panel of LLM judges for automated, nuanced assessment of complex answers.

While optical sensors such as RGB and LiDAR offer high spatial fidelity, they suffer from severe occlusions and introduce privacy risks in indoor environments. In contrast, millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar preserves privacy and penetrates obstacles, but its inherently low spatial resolution makes reliable geometric reasoning difficult.\n  We introduce RISE, the first benchmark and system for single-static-radar indoor scene understanding, jointly targeting layout reconstruction and object detection. RISE is built upon the key insight that multipath reflections, traditionally treated as noise, encode rich geometric cues. To exploit this, we propose a Bi-Angular Multipath Enhancement that explicitly models Angle-of-Arrival and Angle-of-Departure to recover secondary (ghost) reflections and reveal invisible structures. On top of these enhanced observations, a simulation-to-reality Hierarchical Diffusion framework transforms fragmented radar responses into complete layout reconstruction and object detection.\n  Our benchmark contains 50,000 frames collected across 100 real indoor trajectories, forming the first large-scale dataset dedicated to radar-based indoor scene understanding. Extensive experiments show that RISE reduces the Chamfer Distance by 60% (down to 16 cm) compared to the state of the art in layout reconstruction, and delivers the first mmWave-based object detection, achieving 58% IoU. These results establish RISE as a new foundation for geometry-aware and privacy-preserving indoor scene understanding using a single static radar.", "AI": {"tldr": "RISE\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u9759\u6001\u96f7\u8fbe\u7684\u5ba4\u5185\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u53cd\u5c04\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5e03\u5c40\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5149\u5b66\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u906e\u6321\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5ba4\u5185\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u5149\u5b66\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u906e\u6321\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u800c\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u96f7\u8fbe\u867d\u7136\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u5e76\u80fd\u7a7f\u900f\u969c\u788d\u7269\uff0c\u4f46\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4f4e\u5bfc\u81f4\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBi-Angular Multipath Enhancement\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u5230\u8fbe\u89d2\u548c\u51fa\u53d1\u89d2\u6765\u6062\u590d\u6b21\u7ea7\u53cd\u5c04\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684Hierarchical Diffusion\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u788e\u7247\u5316\u7684\u96f7\u8fbe\u54cd\u5e94\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u5e03\u5c40\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e03\u5c40\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u9762\u5c06Chamfer Distance\u964d\u4f4e60%\uff08\u964d\u81f316\u5398\u7c73\uff09\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u8fbe\u523058% IoU\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b50,000\u5e27\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "conclusion": "RISE\u4e3a\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u9759\u6001\u96f7\u8fbe\u8fdb\u884c\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u5ba4\u5185\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u53cd\u5c04\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

However, when predicting over a set of candidate options, LLMs suffer from label biases, and existing calibration methods overlook biases arising from multi-token class labels. We tackle an issue we call label length bias, where labels of different lengths are treated inconsistently, even after standard length normalization. To mitigate it, we propose normalized contextual calibration (NCC), an effective method that normalizes and calibrates predictions at the full-label level. NCC achieves statistically significant improvements over prior approaches across multiple datasets and models, with gains of up to 10% F1. Moreover, NCC extends bias mitigation to broader tasks such as multiple-choice question answering. Our analysis shows that, when combined with in-context learning, NCC is less sensitive to few-shot example selection, requires fewer examples for competitive performance, and produces more reliable confidence estimates.

Existing studies mainly focus on general safety evaluations, with limited attention to the unique safety requirements of educational scenarios. To address this gap, we construct EduHarm, a benchmark containing safe-unsafe instruction pairs across five representative educational scenarios, enabling systematic safety evaluation of educational LLMs. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage shield framework (TSSF) for educational LLMs that simultaneously mitigates both jailbreak and fine-tuning attacks. First, safety-aware attention realignment redirects attention toward critical unsafe tokens, thereby restoring the harmfulness feature that discriminates between unsafe and safe inputs. Second, layer-wise safety judgment identifies harmfulness features by aggregating safety cues across multiple layers to detect unsafe instructions. Finally, defense-driven dual routing separates safe and unsafe queries, ensuring normal processing for benign inputs and guarded responses for harmful ones. Extensive experiments across eight jailbreak attack strategies demonstrate that TSSF effectively strengthens safety while preventing over-refusal of benign queries. Evaluations on three fine-tuning attack datasets further show that it consistently achieves robust defense against harmful queries while maintaining preserving utility gains from benign fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86EduHarm\u57fa\u51c6\u548cTSSF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\u6559\u80b2\u573a\u666f\u4e0bLLM\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u8d8a\u72f1\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u901a\u7528\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u6559\u80b2\u573a\u666f\u72ec\u7279\u5b89\u5168\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u4e13\u95e8\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaEduHarm\u57fa\u51c6\u5305\u542b\u4e94\u4e2a\u6559\u80b2\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5b89\u5168-\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u6307\u4ee4\u5bf9\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u9632\u62a4\u6846\u67b6TSSF\uff1a\u5b89\u5168\u611f\u77e5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u91cd\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u5206\u5c42\u5b89\u5168\u5224\u65ad\u3001\u9632\u5fa1\u9a71\u52a8\u53cc\u8def\u7531\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516b\u79cd\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eTSSF\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e14\u907f\u514d\u826f\u6027\u67e5\u8be2\u8fc7\u5ea6\u62d2\u7edd\uff1b\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5fae\u8c03\u653b\u51fb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5176\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u9632\u5fa1\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6548\u7528\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "TSSF\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u7f13\u89e3\u8d8a\u72f1\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4e3a\u6559\u80b2LLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u6b63\u5e38\u529f\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this context, language guidance provides an effective alternative, requiring minimal expert effort while bypassing the cognitively demanding task of precise boundary delineation in segmentation.

Instead of training detectors tailored to specific datasets, we study a training-free approach leveraging self-supervised models without requiring prior data knowledge. These models, pre-trained with augmentations like RandomResizedCrop, learn to produce consistent representations across varying resolutions. Motivated by this, we propose WaRPAD, a training-free AI-generated image detection algorithm based on self-supervised models. Since neighborhood pixel differences in images are highly sensitive to resizing operations, WaRPAD first defines a base score function that quantifies the sensitivity of image embeddings to perturbations along high-frequency directions extracted via Haar wavelet decomposition. To simulate robustness against cropping augmentation, we rescale each image to a multiple of the models input size, divide it into smaller patches, and compute the base score for each patch. The final detection score is then obtained by averaging the scores across all patches.

The system integrates three components: (i) a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) assistant for personalized, knowledge-grounded dialogue; (ii) a synthetic client-therapist dialogue generator conditioned on client profiles to facilitate research on therapeutic language and data augmentation; and (iii) a Well-being AI crew, implemented with CrewAI, that produces weekly self-care plans and guided meditation audio. The system is designed as a reflective space for emotional processing rather than a substitute for professional therapy. It illustrates how conversational assistants can lower barriers to support, complement existing care, and broaden access to mental health resources. To address the shortage of confidential therapeutic data, we introduce synthetic client-therapist dialogue generation conditioned on client profiles. Finally, the planner demonstrates an innovative agentic workflow for dynamically adaptive, personalized self-care, bridging the limitations of static well-being tools. We describe the architecture, demonstrate its functionalities, and report evaluation of the RAG assistant in curated well-being scenarios using both automatic LLM-based judgments and a human-user study.

The key challenges of the task lie in two aspects: (1) faithfully preserving the garment details, and (2) gaining fine-grained controllability over the model's appearance. Existing methods typically require performing garment deformation in the generation process, which often leads to garment texture distortions. Also, they fail to control the fine-grained attributes of the generated models, due to the lack of specifically designed mechanisms. To address these issues, we propose FashionMAC, a novel diffusion-based deformation-free framework that achieves high-quality and controllable fashion showcase image generation. The core idea of our framework is to eliminate the need for performing garment deformation and directly outpaint the garment segmented from a dressed person, which enables faithful preservation of the intricate garment details. Moreover, we propose a novel region-adaptive decoupled attention (RADA) mechanism along with a chained mask injection strategy to achieve fine-grained appearance controllability over the synthesized human models. Specifically, RADA adaptively predicts the generated regions for each fine-grained text attribute and enforces the text attribute to focus on the predicted regions by a chained mask injection strategy, significantly enhancing the visual fidelity and the controllability.

Currently, this emerging field lacks in-depth exploration into RL approaches specifically tailored for the LLM Agent context, alongside a scarcity of flexible and easily extensible training frameworks designed for this purpose. To help advance this area, this paper first revisits and clarifies Reinforcement Learning methodologies for LLM Agents by systematically extending the Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework to comprehensively define the key components of an LLM Agent.

This synthetic benchmark is derived from the one used during the SIGIR'2025 LiveRAG Challenge, where competitors were evaluated under strict time constraints. It is augmented with information that was not made available to competitors during the Challenge, such as the ground-truth answers, together with their associated supporting claims which were used for evaluating competitors' answers.

However, extending AR models to general image editing remains challenging due to weak and inefficient conditioning, often leading to poor instruction adherence and visual artifacts. To address this, we propose SCAR, a Semantic-Context-driven method for Autoregressive models. SCAR introduces two key components: Compressed Semantic Prefilling, which encodes high-level semantics into a compact and efficient prefix, and Semantic Alignment Guidance, which aligns the last visual hidden states with target semantics during autoregressive decoding to enhance instruction fidelity. Unlike decoding-stage injection methods, SCAR builds upon the flexibility and generality of vector-quantized-based prefilling while overcoming its semantic limitations and high cost. It generalizes across both next-token and next-set AR paradigms with minimal architectural changes. SCAR achieves superior visual fidelity and semantic alignment on both instruction editing and controllable generation benchmarks, outperforming prior AR-based methods while maintaining controllability.

Existing token compression methods, while varied, often lack a high-level semantic understanding, leading to suboptimal merges, information redundancy, or context loss. To address these limitations, we introduce CORE (Compact Object-centric REpresentations), a new paradigm for visual token compression. CORE leverages an efficient segmentation decoder to generate object masks, which serve as a high-level semantic prior to guide the merging of visual tokens into a compact set of object-centric representations. Furthermore, a novel centroid-guided sorting mechanism restores a coherent spatial order to the merged tokens, preserving vital positional information.

We used electronic health record (EHR) data to dynamically track AKI patients' clinical evolution and characterize AKI-to-CKD progression. Post-AKI clinical states were identified by clustering patient vectors derived from longitudinal medical codes and creatinine measurements. Transition probabilities between states and progression to CKD were estimated using multi-state modeling. After identifying common post-AKI trajectories, CKD risk factors in AKI subpopulations were identified through survival analysis. Of 20,699 patients with AKI at admission, 3,491 (17%) developed CKD. We identified fifteen distinct post-AKI states, each with different probabilities of CKD development. Most patients (75%, n=15,607) remained in a single state or made only one transition during the study period. Both established (e.g., AKI severity, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, liver disease) and novel CKD risk factors, with their impact varying across these clinical states.

This dependency on \"big data\" is a critical bottleneck in the medical domain, where patient data is inherently difficult to acquire and expert annotation is expensive, particularly for rare diseases where samples are scarce by definition. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel paradigm: Zero-Training Task-Specific Model Synthesis (ZS-TMS). Instead of adapting a pre-existing model or training a new one, our approach leverages a large-scale, pre-trained generative engine to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier. Our framework, the Semantic-Guided Parameter Synthesizer (SGPS), takes as input minimal, multi-modal task information as little as a single example image (1-shot) and a corresponding clinical text description to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier.\n  The generative engine interprets these inputs to generate the weights for a lightweight, efficient classifier (e.g., an EfficientNet-V2), which can be deployed for inference immediately without any task-specific training or fine-tuning. We conduct extensive evaluations on challenging few-shot classification benchmarks derived from the ISIC 2018 skin lesion dataset and a custom rare disease dataset. Our results demonstrate that SGPS establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming advanced few-shot and zero-shot learning methods, especially in the ultra-low data regimes of 1-shot and 5-shot classification.

Although recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have enabled automatic bias classification, the extent to which large language models (LLMs) align with human judgment still remains relatively underexplored and not yet well understood. This study aims to present a comparative framework for evaluating the detection of political bias across human annotations and multiple LLMs, including GPT, BERT, RoBERTa, and FLAN. We construct a manually annotated dataset of news articles and assess annotation consistency, bias polarity, and inter-model agreement to quantify divergence between human and model perceptions of bias. Experimental results show that among traditional transformer-based models, RoBERTa achieves the highest alignment with human labels, whereas generative models such as GPT demonstrate the strongest overall agreement with human annotations in a zero-shot setting. Among all transformer-based baselines, our fine-tuned RoBERTa model acquired the highest accuracy and the strongest alignment with human-annotated labels.

This limitation stems in part from training data that focuses on language reasoning rather than spatial understanding due to scarce 3D resources, leaving inherent grounding biases unresolved. To address this, we propose 3D scene editing as a key mechanism to generate precise visual counterfactuals that mitigate these biases through fine-grained spatial manipulation, without requiring costly scene reconstruction or large-scale 3D data collection. Furthermore, to make these edits targeted and directly address the specific weaknesses of the model, we introduce DEER-3D, an error-driven framework following a structured \"Decompose, Diagnostic Evaluation, Edit, and Re-train\" workflow, rather than broadly or randomly augmenting data as in conventional approaches. Specifically, upon identifying a grounding failure of the 3D-LLM, our framework first diagnoses the exact predicate-level error (e.g., attribute or spatial relation). It then executes minimal, predicate-aligned 3D scene edits, such as recoloring or repositioning, to produce targeted counterfactual supervision for iterative model fine-tuning, significantly enhancing grounding accuracy. We evaluate our editing pipeline across multiple benchmarks for 3D grounding and scene understanding tasks, consistently demonstrating improvements across all evaluated datasets through iterative refinement.

Convectional pipelines decouple noisy evidence extraction from downstream inferential diagnosis, and general/medical large language models (LLMs) face scarce real world electronic health records (EHRs), stale domain knowledge, and hallucinations. We assemble a large, domain specialized clinical corpus and a clinician validated reasoning set, and develop RareSeek R1 via staged instruction tuning, chain of thought learning, and graph grounded retrieval. Across multicenter EHR narratives and public benchmarks, RareSeek R1 attains state of the art accuracy, robust generalization, and stability under noisy or overlapping phenotypes. Augmented retrieval yields the largest gains when narratives pair with prioritized variants by resolving ambiguity and aligning candidates to mechanisms.

In one such case--the comparative illusion (CI), e.g., More students have been to Russia than I have--comprehenders tend to judge the sentence as acceptable despite its underlying nonsensical comparison. Prior research has argued that this phenomenon can be explained as Bayesian inference over a noisy channel: the posterior probability of an interpretation of a sentence is proportional to both the prior probability of that interpretation and the likelihood of corruption into the observed (CI) sentence. Initial behavioral work has supported this claim by evaluating a narrow set of alternative interpretations of CI sentences and showing that comprehenders favor interpretations that are more likely to have been corrupted into the illusory sentence. In this study, we replicate and go substantially beyond this earlier work by directly predicting the strength of illusion with a quantitative model of the posterior probability of plausible interpretations, which we derive through a novel synthesis of statistical language models with human behavioral data. Our model explains not only the fine gradations in the strength of CI effects, but also a previously unexplained effect caused by pronominal vs. full noun phrase than-clause subjects. These findings support a noisy-channel theory of sentence comprehension by demonstrating that the theory makes novel predictions about the comparative illusion that bear out empirically. This outcome joins related evidence of noisy channel processing in both illusory and non-illusory contexts to support noisy channel inference as a unified computational-level theory of diverse language processing phenomena.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u901a\u9053\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u6bd4\u8f83\u9519\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u5b9a\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u9519\u89c9\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bcd\u4e0e\u5b8c\u6574\u540d\u8bcd\u77ed\u8bed\u5bf9\u9519\u89c9\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u9519\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\u4e2d\u4eba\u4eec\u4f1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u8bef\u89e3\u53e5\u5b50\uff0c\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u901a\u9053\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u6b64\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u5b9a\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u5408\u7406\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u6bd4\u8f83\u9519\u89c9\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u9519\u89c9\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8fd8\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4ee3\u8bcd\u4e0e\u5b8c\u6574\u540d\u8bcd\u77ed\u8bed\u4e3b\u8bed\u5bf9\u9519\u89c9\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5148\u524d\u672a\u89e3\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u652f\u6301\u566a\u58f0\u901a\u9053\u7406\u8bba\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ea7\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u80fd\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f83\u9519\u89c9\u505a\u51fa\u65b0\u9896\u4e14\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002"}}

In this paper, for the LTR, we propose a binary cross-entropy (BCE)-based tripartite synergistic learning, termed BCE3S, which consists of three components: (1) BCE-based joint learning optimizes both the classifier and sample features, which achieves better compactness and separability among features than the CE-based joint learning, by decoupling the metrics between feature and the imbalanced classifier vectors in multiple Sigmoid; (2) BCE-based contrastive learning further improves the intra-class compactness of features; (3) BCE-based uniform learning balances the separability among classifier vectors and interactively enhances the feature properties by combining with the joint learning. The extensive experiments show that the LTR model trained by BCE3S not only achieves higher compactness and separability among sample features, but also balances the classifier's separability, achieving SOTA performance on various long-tailed datasets such as CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist2018.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faBCE3S\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8c\u5143\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u7684\u4e09\u65b9\u534f\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u5c3e\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5747\u5300\u5b66\u4e60\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u957f\u5c3e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u7684\u957f\u5c3e\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u5177\u6709\u7406\u60f3\u7279\u6027\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e14\u5728Softmax\u5206\u6bcd\u4e2d\u8026\u5408\u4e86\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u653e\u5927\u4e86\u957f\u5c3e\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "method": "BCE3S\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1) BCE\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4e2aSigmoid\u89e3\u8026\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\uff1b2) BCE\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u7c7b\u5185\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\uff1b3) BCE\u5747\u5300\u5b66\u4e60\u5e73\u8861\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5411\u91cf\u95f4\u7684\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR10-LT\u3001CIFAR100-LT\u3001ImageNet-LT\u548ciNaturalist2018\u7b49\u957f\u5c3e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cBCE3S\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u957f\u5c3e\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "BCE3S\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u65b9\u534f\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u5c3e\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, existing methods often rely on task-specific designs or latent routing strategies, making it hard to adapt to real-world scenarios with various degradations. We propose FAPE-IR, a Frequency-Aware Planning and Execution framework for image restoration. It uses a frozen Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as a planner to analyze degraded images and generate concise, frequency-aware restoration plans. These plans guide a LoRA-based Mixture-of-Experts (LoRA-MoE) module within a diffusion-based executor, which dynamically selects high- or low-frequency experts, complemented by frequency features of the input image. To further improve restoration quality and reduce artifacts, we introduce adversarial training and a frequency regularization loss. By coupling semantic planning with frequency-based restoration, FAPE-IR offers a unified and interpretable solution for all-in-one image restoration.

While existing methods can modify video content if explicit descriptions of editing targets with precise spatial locations and temporal boundaries are provided, these requirements become impractical when users attempt to conceptualize edits through implicit queries referencing semantic properties or object relationships. We introduce reasoning video editing, a task where video editing models must interpret implicit queries through multi-hop reasoning to infer editing targets before executing modifications, and a first model attempting to solve this complex task, RIVER (Reasoning-based Implicit Video Editor). RIVER decouples reasoning from generation through digital twin representations of video content that preserve spatial relationships, temporal trajectories, and semantic attributes. A large language model then processes this representation jointly with the implicit query, performing multi-hop reasoning to determine modifications, then outputs structured instructions that guide a diffusion-based editor to execute pixel-level changes. RIVER training uses reinforcement learning with rewards that evaluate reasoning accuracy and generation quality. Finally, we introduce RVEBenchmark, a benchmark of 100 videos with 519 implicit queries spanning three levels and categories of reasoning complexity specifically for reasoning video editing.

State-of-the-art methods aggregate features from deep backbones to form global descriptors. Optimal transport-based aggregation methods reformulate feature-to-cluster assignment as a transport problem, but the standard Sinkhorn algorithm symmetrically treats source and target marginals, limiting effectiveness when image features and cluster centers exhibit substantially different distributions. We propose an asymmetric aggregation VPR method with geometric constraints for locally aggregated descriptors, called $A^2$GC-VPR.

Although existing video-based systems can detect when incidents occur, they provide little insight into how these events unfold across the distinct cognitive phases of pedestrian behavior. Recent vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential for video understanding, but they remain limited in that they typically process videos in isolation, without explicit temporal structuring or multi-view integration. This paper introduces Multi-view Phase-aware Pedestrian-Vehicle Incident Reasoning (MP-PVIR), a unified framework that systematically processes multi-view video streams into structured diagnostic reports through four stages: (1) event-triggered multi-view video acquisition, (2) pedestrian behavior phase segmentation, (3) phase-specific multi-view reasoning, and (4) hierarchical synthesis and diagnostic reasoning. The framework operationalizes behavioral theory by automatically segmenting incidents into cognitive phases, performing synchronized multi-view analysis within each phase, and synthesizing results into causal chains with targeted prevention strategies. Particularly, two specialized VLMs underpin the MP-PVIR pipeline: TG-VLM for behavioral phase segmentation (mIoU = 0.4881) and PhaVR-VLM for phase-aware multi-view analysis, achieving a captioning score of 33.063 and up to 64.70% accuracy on question answering. Finally, a designated large language model is used to generate comprehensive reports detailing scene understanding, behavior interpretation, causal reasoning, and prevention recommendations.

We argue that convolution and self-attention, despite their apparent differences, can be unified within a single k-nearest neighbor aggregation framework. The critical insight is that both operations are special cases of neighbor selection and aggregation; convolution selects neighbors by spatial proximity, while attention selects by feature similarity, revealing they exist on a continuous spectrum. We introduce Convolutional Nearest Neighbors (ConvNN), a unified framework that formalizes this connection. Crucially, ConvNN serves as a drop-in replacement for convolutional and attention layers, enabling systematic exploration of the intermediate spectrum between these two extremes. We validate the framework's coherence on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 classification tasks across two complementary architectures: (1) Hybrid branching in VGG improves accuracy on both CIFAR datasets by combining spatial-proximity and feature-similarity selection; and (2) ConvNN in ViT outperforms standard attention and other attention variants on both datasets. Extensive ablations on $k$ values and architectural variants reveal that interpolating along this spectrum provides regularization benefits by balancing local and global receptive fields. Our work provides a unifying framework that dissolves the apparent distinction between convolution and attention, with implications for designing more principled and interpretable vision architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5377\u79ef\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\uff08ConvNN\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5377\u79ef\u548c\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7edf\u4e00\u5230k\u8fd1\u90bb\u805a\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u90fd\u662f\u90bb\u5c45\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u805a\u5408\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u53ea\u662f\u5206\u522b\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4\u90bb\u8fd1\u6027\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1CNN\u548cTransformer\u91cd\u5851\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\uff0c\u4f46\u5377\u79ef\u548c\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u6839\u672c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u64cd\u4f5c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u7684k\u8fd1\u90bb\u805a\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u53ea\u662f\u90bb\u5c45\u9009\u62e9\u6807\u51c6\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165ConvNN\u6846\u67b6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5377\u79ef\u5c42\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u66ff\u4ee3\u54c1\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u90bb\u8fd1\u6027\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u5728VGG\u548cViT\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u652f\u548cConvNN\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-10\u548cCIFAR-100\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1aVGG\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u652f\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1bViT\u4e2d\u7684ConvNN\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53d8\u4f53\uff1b\u5728k\u503c\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u53d8\u4f53\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6d88\u878d\u663e\u793a\u6cbf\u8be5\u8c31\u63d2\u503c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u8861\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u63d0\u4f9b\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6548\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u5377\u79ef\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u660e\u663e\u533a\u522b\uff0c\u5bf9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u539f\u5219\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u67b6\u6784\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

In contrast to past mmWave reconstruction methods, which suffer from limited coverage and high noise, Wave-Former introduces a physics-aware shape completion model capable of inferring full 3D geometry. At the heart of Wave-Former's design is a novel three-stage pipeline which bridges raw wireless signals with recent advancements in vision-based shape completion by incorporating physical properties of mmWave signals. The pipeline proposes candidate geometric surfaces, employs a transformer-based shape completion model designed specifically for mmWave signals, and finally performs entropy-guided surface selection.

This is mainly due to two overlooked risks that affect cross-domain multimodal generalization. The first is the modal representation invariant risk, i.e., whether representations remain generalizable under domain shift. We theoretically show that the inherent class asymmetry in FAS (diverse spoofs vs. compact reals) enlarges the upper bound of generalization error, and this effect is further amplified in multimodal settings. The second is the modal synergy invariant risk, where models overfit to domain-specific inter-modal correlations. Such spurious synergy cannot generalize to unseen attacks in target domains, leading to performance drops. To solve these issues, we propose a provable framework, namely Multimodal Representation and Synergy Invariance Learning (RiSe). For representation risk, RiSe introduces Asymmetric Invariant Risk Minimization (AsyIRM), which learns an invariant spherical decision boundary in radial space to fit asymmetric distributions, while preserving domain cues in angular space.

However, existing robustness benchmarks typically focus on hallucination or misleading textual inputs, while largely overlooking the equally critical challenge posed by misleading visual inputs in assessing visual understanding. To fill this important gap, we introduce MVI-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark specially designed for evaluating how Misleading Visual Inputs undermine the robustness of LVLMs. Grounded in fundamental visual primitives, the design of MVI-Bench centers on three hierarchical levels of misleading visual inputs: Visual Concept, Visual Attribute, and Visual Relationship. Using this taxonomy, we curate six representative categories and compile 1,248 expertly annotated VQA instances. To facilitate fine-grained robustness evaluation, we further introduce MVI-Sensitivity, a novel metric that characterizes LVLM robustness at a granular level. Empirical results across 18 state-of-the-art LVLMs uncover pronounced vulnerabilities to misleading visual inputs, and our in-depth analyses on MVI-Bench provide actionable insights that can guide the development of more reliable and robust LVLMs. The benchmark and codebase can be accessed at https://github.com/chenyil6/MVI-Bench.", "AI": {"tldr": "MVI-Bench\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b1,248\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684VQA\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u89c6\u89c9\u6982\u5ff5\u3001\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807MVI-Sensitivity\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5e7b\u89c9\u6216\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u91cd\u8981\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u5143\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e09\u5c42\u6b21\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u5206\u7c7b\uff1a\u89c6\u89c9\u6982\u5ff5\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u516d\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86MVI-Sensitivity\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5bf918\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdbLVLM\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5bf9\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u663e\u8457\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684LVLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "MVI-Bench\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LVLM\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Additionally, the traditional patch-wise scanning tokenization workflow misaligns with the human vision cognition system, further leading to hallucination and computational redundancy. To address this issue, we propose an object-level token merging strategy for Adaptive Token compression, revealing the consistency with human vision system. The experiments are conducted on multiple comprehensive benchmarks, which show that our approach averagely, utilizes only 10% tokens while achieving almost 96% of the vanilla model's performance.

To address these challenges, this paper proposes Dominance-Game Contrastive Learning network for skeleton-based action Recognition (DoGCLR), a self-supervised framework based on game theory. DoGCLR models the construction of positive and negative samples as a dynamic Dominance Game, where both sample types interact to reach an equilibrium that balances semantic preservation and discriminative strength. Specifically, a spatio-temporal dual weight localization mechanism identifies key motion regions and guides region-wise augmentations to enhance motion diversity while maintaining semantics. In parallel, an entropy-driven dominance strategy manages the memory bank by retaining high entropy (hard) negatives and replacing low-entropy (weak) ones, ensuring consistent exposure to informative contrastive signals. Extensive experiments are conducted on NTU RGB+D and PKU-MMD datasets. On NTU RGB+D 60 X-Sub/X-View, DoGCLR achieves 81.1%/89.4% accuracy, and on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Sub/X-Set, DoGCLR achieves 71.2%/75.5% accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 0.1%, 2.7%, 1.1%, and 2.3%, respectively.

Leveraging the common essence of soft effects, i.e., semi-transparent occlusions, we introduce a foundational versatile model UniSER, capable of addressing diverse degradations caused by soft effects within a single framework. Our methodology centers on curating a massive 3.8M-pair dataset to ensure robustness and generalization, which includes novel, physically-plausible data to fill critical gaps in public benchmarks, and a tailored training pipeline that fine-tunes a Diffusion Transformer to learn robust restoration priors from this diverse data, integrating fine-grained mask and strength controls. This synergistic approach allows UniSER to significantly outperform both specialist and generalist models, achieving robust, high-fidelity restoration in the wild.", "AI": {"tldr": "UniSER\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u5904\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u8f6f\u6548\u5e94\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5982\u955c\u5934\u5149\u6655\u3001\u96fe\u973e\u3001\u9634\u5f71\u548c\u53cd\u5c04\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5b9a\u5236\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e13\u4e1a\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u4e00\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u5f00\u53d1\u4e13\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e14\u672a\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u4fee\u590d\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u672c\u8d28\uff1b\u800c\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u8be6\u7ec6\u63d0\u793a\u4e14\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b380\u4e07\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u516c\u5171\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9a\u5236\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u4ee5\u4ece\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u9c81\u68d2\u4fee\u590d\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "UniSER\u5728\u91ce\u5916\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7684\u4fee\u590d\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e13\u4e1a\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u8f6f\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5171\u540c\u672c\u8d28\uff08\u534a\u900f\u660e\u906e\u6321\uff09\u548c\u534f\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cUniSER\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

These methods employ a locally supervised approach for semantic supervision, which limits the uniformity of semantic distribution. However, VA-VAE proves that a more uniform feature distribution yields better generation performance. In this work, we introduce a Global Perspective Tokenizer (GloTok), which utilizes global relational information to model a more uniform semantic distribution of tokenized features. Specifically, a codebook-wise histogram relation learning method is proposed to transfer the semantics, which are modeled by pre-trained models on the entire dataset, to the semantic codebook. Then, we design a residual learning module that recovers the fine-grained details to minimize the reconstruction error caused by quantization. Through the above design, GloTok delivers more uniformly distributed semantic latent representations, which facilitates the training of autoregressive (AR) models for generating high-quality images without requiring direct access to pre-trained models during the training process.

For each key frame, 20 Hz vehicle trajectories spanning the past 6 s and future 5 s are provided, along with detailed 2D annotations of surrounding vehicles, pedestrians, traffic lights, and traffic signs. These key frames have rich scenario-level attributes, including driver intent, area type (covering highways, urban roads, and residential areas), lighting (day, night, or dusk), weather (clear or rain), road surface (paved or unpaved), traffic and vulnerable road users (VRU) density, traffic lights, and traffic signs (warning, prohibition, and indication). To evaluate the safety of AVs, we employ an end-to-end motion planning model that predicts vehicle trajectories with an Average Displacement Error (ADE) of 1.4 m on autonomous-driving frames.

Minimally invasive repairs involving branch vessels necessitate detailed 3D anatomical analysis. Existing methods often overlook hierarchical anatomical relationships while struggling with severe class imbalance inherent in vascular structures. We address these challenges with a curriculum learning strategy that leverages a novel fractal softmax for hierarchical semantic learning. Inspired by human cognition, our approach progressively learns anatomical constraints by decomposing complex structures from simple to complex components. The curriculum learning framework naturally addresses class imbalance by first establishing robust feature representations for dominant classes before tackling rare but anatomically critical structures, significantly accelerating model convergence in multi-class scenarios. Our two-stage inference strategy achieves up to fivefold acceleration, enhancing clinical practicality. On the validation set at epoch 50, our hierarchical semantic loss improves the Dice score of nnU-Net ResEnc M by 11.65%. The proposed model demonstrates a 5.6% higher Dice score than baselines on the test set. Experimental results show significant improvements in segmentation accuracy and efficiency, making the framework suitable for real-time clinical applications.

Online data curation extends this idea by dynamically selecting training samples based on the model's evolving state. While effective in classification and multimodal learning, existing online sampling strategies rarely extend to object detection because of its structural complexity and domain gaps. We introduce DetGain, an online data curation method specifically for object detection that estimates the marginal perturbation of each image to dataset-level Average Precision (AP) based on its prediction quality. By modeling global score distributions, DetGain efficiently estimates the global AP change and computes teacher-student contribution gaps to select informative samples at each iteration. The method is architecture-agnostic and minimally intrusive, enabling straightforward integration into diverse object detection architectures. Experiments on the COCO dataset with multiple representative detectors show consistent improvements in accuracy. DetGain also demonstrates strong robustness under low-quality data and can be effectively combined with knowledge distillation techniques to further enhance performance, highlighting its potential as a general and complementary strategy for data-efficient object detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "DetGain\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u7b5b\u9009\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f30\u8ba1\u6bcf\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7ea7AP\u7684\u8fb9\u9645\u6270\u52a8\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5728\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9a\u5f8b\u4e0b\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u9a71\u52a8\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5728\u7ebf\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u9886\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u3002", "method": "DetGain\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u8d28\u91cf\u5efa\u6a21\u5168\u5c40\u5f97\u5206\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u4f30\u8ba1\u5168\u5c40AP\u53d8\u5316\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e08\u751f\u8d21\u732e\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6837\u672c\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u67b6\u6784\u65e0\u5173\u4e14\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u6700\u5c0f\uff0c\u53ef\u8f7b\u677e\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5404\u79cd\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728COCO\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDetGain\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "DetGain\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u6570\u636e\u7b5b\u9009\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Diffusion-based priors currently deliver state-of-the-art reconstructions, but existing approaches either adapt image diffusion models with ad hoc temporal regularizers - leading to temporal artifacts - or rely on native video diffusion models whose iterative posterior sampling is far too slow for real-time use. We introduce InstantViR, an amortized inference framework for ultra-fast video reconstruction powered by a pre-trained video diffusion prior. We distill a powerful bidirectional video diffusion model (teacher) into a causal autoregressive student that maps a degraded video directly to its restored version in a single forward pass, inheriting the teacher's strong temporal modeling while completely removing iterative test-time optimization. The distillation is prior-driven: it only requires the teacher diffusion model and known degradation operators, and does not rely on externally paired clean/noisy video data. To further boost throughput, we replace the video-diffusion backbone VAE with a high-efficiency LeanVAE via an innovative teacher-space regularized distillation scheme, enabling low-latency latent-space processing. Across streaming random inpainting, Gaussian deblurring and super-resolution, InstantViR matches or surpasses the reconstruction quality of diffusion-based baselines while running at over 35 FPS on NVIDIA A100 GPUs, achieving up to 100 times speedups over iterative video diffusion solvers. These results show that diffusion-based video reconstruction is compatible with real-time, interactive, editable, streaming scenarios, turning high-quality video restoration into a practical component of modern vision systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "InstantViR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u8d85\u5feb\u901f\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u53cc\u5411\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u84b8\u998f\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u89c6\u9891\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u8fbe\u523035+ FPS\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u9891\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u9ad8\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u8fed\u4ee3\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u901f\u5ea6\u8fc7\u6162\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u6559\u5e08\uff09\u84b8\u998f\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u6559\u5e08\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5df2\u77e5\u9000\u5316\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528LeanVAE\u66ff\u6362VAE\u9aa8\u5e72\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6559\u5e08\u7a7a\u95f4\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6848\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6d41\u5f0f\u968f\u673a\u4fee\u590d\u3001\u9ad8\u65af\u53bb\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cInstantViR\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5728NVIDIA A100 GPU\u4e0a\u8fd0\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u8d85\u8fc735 FPS\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u8fed\u4ee3\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe100\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u6563\u57fa\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u3001\u6d41\u5f0f\u573a\u666f\u517c\u5bb9\uff0c\u4f7f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u6062\u590d\u6210\u4e3a\u73b0\u4ee3\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002"}}

However, existing methods typically produce deterministic results, struggling to capture this one-to-many nature. In this paper, we propose a Measurement-Constrained Sampling (MCS) approach that enables diverse LQ face reconstructions conditioned on different textual prompts. Specifically, we formulate BFR as a measurement-constrained generative task by constructing an inverse problem through controlled degradations of coarse restorations, which allows posterior-guided sampling within text-to-image diffusion. Measurement constraints include both Forward Measurement, which ensures results align with input structures, and Reverse Measurement, which produces projection spaces, ensuring that the solution can align with various prompts.

To address these limitations, we propose a novel autoregressive diffusion model that processes input audio in a streaming manner. This design ensures flexibility with varying audio lengths and achieves low latency independent of audio duration. Specifically, we select a limited number of past frames as historical motion context and combine them with the audio input to create a dynamic condition. This condition guides the diffusion process to iteratively generate facial motion frames, enabling real-time synthesis with high-quality results. Additionally, we implemented a real-time interactive demo, highlighting the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

However, given access to some data from downstream tasks, a natural question arises: can the performance of these models be further improved? To this end, we propose WeSTAR, a parameter-efficient framework that performs Weakly supervised Self-Training Adaptation with Regularization, designed to enhance the robustness of MDE foundation models in unseen and diverse domains. We first adopt a dense self-training objective as the primary source of structural self-supervision. To further improve robustness, we introduce semantically-aware hierarchical normalization, which exploits instance-level segmentation maps to perform more stable and multi-scale structural normalization. Beyond dense supervision, we introduce a cost-efficient weak supervision in the form of pairwise ordinal depth annotations to further guide the adaptation process, which enforces informative ordinal constraints to mitigate local topological errors. Finally, a weight regularization loss is employed to anchor the LoRA updates, ensuring training stability and preserving the model's generalizable knowledge.

To address these limitations, we introduce \\textbf{ManipBench}, a large-scale benchmark for image manipulation detection and localization focusing on AI-edited images.

However, two critical limitations of t-SVD methods persist: (1) the approximation of the latent tensor (e.g., tensor factorizations) is coarse and fails to accurately capture spatial local high-frequency information; (2) The transform matrix is composed of fixed basis atoms (e.g., complex exponential atoms in DFT and cosine atoms in DCT) and cannot precisely capture local high-frequency information along the mode-3 fibers. To address these two limitations, we propose a Gaussian Splatting-based Low-rank tensor Representation (GSLR) framework, which compactly and continuously represents multi-dimensional images. Specifically, we leverage tailored 2D Gaussian splatting and 1D Gaussian splatting to generate the latent tensor and transform matrix, respectively. The 2D and 1D Gaussian splatting are indispensable and complementary under this representation framework, which enjoys a powerful representation capability, especially for local high-frequency information. To evaluate the representation ability of the proposed GSLR, we develop an unsupervised GSLR-based multi-dimensional image recovery model.

First, they struggle with coarse semantic alignment, often failing to capture fine-grained prompt details. Second, they lack robust 3D spatial understanding, leading to geometric inconsistencies and catastrophic failures in part assembly and spatial relationships. To address these challenges, we propose VLM3D, a general framework that repurposes large vision-language models (VLMs) as powerful, differentiable semantic and spatial critics. Our core contribution is a dual-query critic signal derived from the VLM's Yes or No log-odds, which assesses both semantic fidelity and geometric coherence. We demonstrate the generality of this guidance signal across two distinct paradigms: (1) As a reward objective for optimization-based pipelines, VLM3D significantly outperforms existing methods on standard benchmarks.

During surgery, these plans must be accurately transferred, relying on precise cross-registration between preoperative and intraoperative data. However, substantial modality heterogeneity across imaging modalities makes this registration challenging and error-prone. Robust, automatic, and modality-agnostic bone surface registration is therefore clinically important. We propose NeuralBoneReg, a self-supervised, surface-based framework that registers bone surfaces using 3D point clouds as a modality-agnostic representation. NeuralBoneReg includes two modules: an implicit neural unsigned distance field (UDF) that learns the preoperative bone model, and an MLP-based registration module that performs global initialization and local refinement by generating transformation hypotheses to align the intraoperative point cloud with the neural UDF. Unlike SOTA supervised methods, NeuralBoneReg operates in a self-supervised manner, without requiring inter-subject training data. We evaluated NeuralBoneReg against baseline methods on two publicly available multi-modal datasets: a CT-ultrasound dataset of the fibula and tibia (UltraBones100k) and a CT-RGB-D dataset of spinal vertebrae (SpineDepth). The evaluation also includes a newly introduced CT--ultrasound dataset of cadaveric subjects containing femur and pelvis (UltraBones-Hip), which will be made publicly available. NeuralBoneReg matches or surpasses existing methods across all datasets, achieving mean RRE/RTE of 1.68\u00b0/1.86 mm on UltraBones100k, 1.88\u00b0/1.89 mm on UltraBones-Hip, and 3.79\u00b0/2.45 mm on SpineDepth.

However, practical systems are often constrained by ultra-sparse-view sampling, which significantly degrades reconstruction quality. Traditional methods struggle under ultra-sparse-view settings, where interpolation becomes inaccurate and the resulting reconstructions are unsatisfactory. To address this challenge, this study proposes Diffusion-Refined Neural Attenuation Fields (Diff-NAF), an iterative framework tailored for multi-source stationary CT under ultra-sparse-view conditions. Diff-NAF combines a Neural Attenuation Field representation with a dual-branch conditional diffusion model. The process begins by training an initial NAF using ultra-sparse-view projections. New projections are then generated through an Angle-Prior Guided Projection Synthesis strategy that exploits inter view priors, and are subsequently refined by a Diffusion-driven Reuse Projection Refinement Module. The refined projections are incorporated as pseudo-labels into the training set for the next iteration. Through iterative refinement, Diff-NAF progressively enhances projection completeness and reconstruction fidelity under ultra-sparse-view conditions, ultimately yielding high-quality CT reconstructions. Experimental results on multiple simulated 3D CT volumes and real projection data demonstrate that Diff-NAF achieves the best performance under ultra-sparse-view conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Diff-NAF\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u8d85\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u591a\u6e90\u9759\u6001CT\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u8870\u51cf\u573a\u548c\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89d2\u5ea6\u5148\u9a8c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u5408\u6210\u548c\u6269\u6563\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u7ec6\u5316\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6295\u5f71\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6e90\u9759\u6001CT\u5728\u8d85\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u91c7\u6837\u4e0b\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u7a00\u758f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDiff-NAF\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u8d85\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u6295\u5f71\u8bad\u7ec3\u521d\u59cb\u795e\u7ecf\u8870\u51cf\u573a\uff1b2\uff09\u89d2\u5ea6\u5148\u9a8c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u5408\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u6295\u5f71\uff1b3\uff09\u6269\u6563\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u91cd\u7528\u6295\u5f71\u7ec6\u5316\u6a21\u5757\u4f18\u5316\u6295\u5f71\uff1b4\uff09\u8fed\u4ee3\u5730\u5c06\u7ec6\u5316\u6295\u5f71\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u52a0\u5165\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u62df3D CT\u4f53\u79ef\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6295\u5f71\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDiff-NAF\u5728\u8d85\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "Diff-NAF\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ec6\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8d85\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u591a\u6e90\u9759\u6001CT\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u654f\u611f\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) shows promise for novel view synthesis, its application to the standard clinical triad of unposed anterior and bilateral buccal photographs is challenging. The large view baselines, inconsistent illumination, and specular surfaces common in intraoral settings can destabilize simultaneous pose and geometry estimation. Furthermore, sparse-view photometric supervision often induces a frequency bias, leading to over-smoothed reconstructions that lose critical diagnostic details. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{Dental3R}, a pose-free, graph-guided pipeline for robust, high-fidelity reconstruction from sparse intraoral photographs. Our method first constructs a Geometry-Aware Pairing Strategy (GAPS) to intelligently select a compact subgraph of high-value image pairs. The GAPS focuses on correspondence matching, thereby improving the stability of the geometry initialization and reducing memory usage. Building on the recovered poses and point cloud, we train the 3DGS model with a wavelet-regularized objective. By enforcing band-limited fidelity using a discrete wavelet transform, our approach preserves fine enamel boundaries and interproximal edges while suppressing high-frequency artifacts. We validate our approach on a large-scale dataset of 950 clinical cases and an additional video-based test set of 195 cases.

However, existing deep-learning approaches rely heavily on modality-specific training, large annotated datasets, and controlled scanning conditions, which limit generalization across devices and hinder deployment in real clinical workflows. Moreover, raw intraoral meshes exhibit substantial variation in arch pose, incomplete geometry caused by occlusion or tooth contact, and a lack of texture cues, making unified semantic interpretation highly challenging. To address these limitations, we propose ArchMap, a training-free and knowledge-guided framework for robust structured dental understanding. ArchMap first introduces a geometry-aware arch-flattening module that standardizes raw 3D meshes into spatially aligned, continuity-preserving multi-view projections. We then construct a Dental Knowledge Base (DKB) encoding hierarchical tooth ontology, dentition-stage policies, and clinical semantics to constrain the symbolic reasoning space. We validate ArchMap on 1060 pre-/post-orthodontic cases, demonstrating robust performance in tooth counting, anatomical partitioning, dentition-stage classification, and the identification of clinical conditions such as crowding, missing teeth, prosthetics, and caries. Compared with supervised pipelines and prompted VLM baselines, ArchMap achieves higher accuracy, reduced semantic drift, and superior stability under sparse or artifact-prone conditions. As a fully training-free system, ArchMap demonstrates that combining geometric normalization with ontology-guided multimodal reasoning offers a practical and scalable solution for the structured analysis of 3D intraoral scans in modern digital orthodontics.", "AI": {"tldr": "ArchMap\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5f15\u5bfc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e3D\u53e3\u8154\u626b\u63cf\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7259\u5f13\u5c55\u5e73\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u7259\u9f7f\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u548c\u53d7\u63a7\u626b\u63cf\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8de8\u8bbe\u5907\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u539f\u59cb\u53e3\u8154\u7f51\u683c\u5b58\u5728\u7259\u5f13\u59ff\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7eb9\u7406\u7ebf\u7d22\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7259\u5f13\u5c55\u5e73\u6a21\u5757\u5c06\u539f\u59cb3D\u7f51\u683c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u5c42\u6b21\u7259\u9f7f\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u3001\u7259\u5217\u9636\u6bb5\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u7259\u79d1\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u6765\u7ea6\u675f\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u57281060\u4e2a\u6b63\u7578\u524d\u540e\u75c5\u4f8b\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5728\u7259\u9f7f\u8ba1\u6570\u3001\u89e3\u5256\u5206\u533a\u3001\u7259\u5217\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u7c7b\u4ee5\u53ca\u62e5\u6324\u3001\u7f3a\u7259\u3001\u4fee\u590d\u4f53\u548c\u9f8b\u9f7f\u7b49\u4e34\u5e8a\u72b6\u51b5\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cVLM\u57fa\u7ebf\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ArchMap\u8bc1\u660e\u7ed3\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4e0e\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u4e3a\u73b0\u4ee3\u6570\u5b57\u6b63\u7578\u4e2d3D\u53e3\u8154\u626b\u63cf\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

These factors hinder the stability of appearance-based similarity metrics and often lead to convergence failures or anatomically implausible alignments. To address these limitations, we propose DentalSCR, a pose-stable, contour-guided framework for accurate and interpretable silhouette-to-contour registration. Our method first constructs a U-Midline Dental Axis (UMDA) to establish a unified cross-arch anatomical coordinate system, thereby stabilizing initialization and standardizing projection geometry across cases. Using this reference frame, we generate radiograph-like projections via a surface-based DRR formulation with coronal-axis perspective and Gaussian splatting, which preserves clinical source-object-detector magnification and emphasizes external silhouettes. Registration is then formulated as a 2D similarity transform optimized with a symmetric bidirectional Chamfer distance under a hierarchical coarse-to-fine schedule, enabling both large capture range and subpixel-level contour agreement. We evaluate DentalSCR on 34 expert-annotated clinical cases. Experimental results demonstrate substantial reductions in landmark error-particularly at posterior teeth-tighter dispersion on the lower jaw, and low Chamfer and controlled Hausdorff distances at the curve level. These findings indicate that DentalSCR robustly handles real-world cephalograms and delivers high-fidelity, clinically inspectable 3D--2D alignment, outperforming conventional baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "DentalSCR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u53e3\u8154\u5185\u626b\u63cf\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4fa7\u4f4d\u5934\u9885X\u5149\u72473D-2D\u914d\u51c6\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u8f6e\u5ed3\u5f15\u5bfc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u5256\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u548c\u8868\u9762DRR\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u79f0\u53cc\u5411Chamfer\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f18\u5316\u914d\u51c6\uff0c\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u914d\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e34\u5e8a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff08\u5982X\u5149\u7247\u5b58\u5728\u6295\u5f71\u653e\u5927\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u7578\u53d8\u3001\u4f4e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u7259\u51a0\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u914d\u51c6\u5931\u8d25\u6216\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u4e0a\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u6784\u5efaU-Midline Dental Axis\u5efa\u7acb\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u5256\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u8868\u9762DRR\u516c\u5f0f\u548cGaussian splatting\u751f\u6210X\u5149\u7247\u6837\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u79f0\u53cc\u5411Chamfer\u8ddd\u79bb\u5728\u5206\u5c42\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u4f18\u53162D\u76f8\u4f3c\u53d8\u6362\u3002", "result": "\u572834\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u75c5\u4f8b\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6807\u5fd7\u70b9\u8bef\u5dee\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u540e\u7259\u533a\u57df\uff09\uff0c\u4e0b\u988c\u9aa8\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u5e03\u66f4\u96c6\u4e2d\uff0c\u66f2\u7ebf\u7ea7\u522b\u7684Chamfer\u548cHausdorff\u8ddd\u79bb\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "DentalSCR\u80fd\u591f\u7a33\u5065\u5904\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5934\u9885X\u5149\u7247\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u68c0\u67e5\u76843D-2D\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We introduce ARC-Chapter, the first large-scale video chaptering model trained on over million-level long video chapters, featuring bilingual, temporally grounded, and hierarchical chapter annotations. To achieve this goal, we curated a bilingual English-Chinese chapter dataset via a structured pipeline that unifies ASR transcripts, scene texts, visual captions into multi-level annotations, from short title to long summaries. We demonstrate clear performance improvements with data scaling, both in data volume and label intensity. Moreover, we design a new evaluation metric termed GRACE, which incorporates many-to-one segment overlaps and semantic similarity, better reflecting real-world chaptering flexibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARC-Chapter establishes a new state-of-the-art by a significant margin, outperforming the previous best by 14.0% in F1 score and 11.3% in SODA score.

However, its use of low-degree spherical harmonics limits its ability to capture spatially varying color and view-dependent effects such as specular highlights. Existing works augment Gaussians with either a global texture map, which struggles with complex scenes, or per-Gaussian texture maps, which introduces high storage overhead. We propose Image-Based Gaussian Splatting, an efficient alternative that leverages high-resolution source images for fine details and view-specific color modeling. Specifically, we model each pixel color as a combination of a base color from standard 3DGS rendering and a learned residual inferred from neighboring training images. This promotes accurate surface alignment and enables rendering images of high-frequency details and accurate view-dependent effects.

Therefore, the effectiveness of Physical Adversarial Examples (PAEs) on stereo-based binocular depth estimation remains largely unexplored. To this end, we propose the first texture-enabled physical adversarial attack against stereo matching models in the context of autonomous driving. Our method employs a 3D PAE with global camouflage texture rather than a local 2D patch-based one, ensuring both visual consistency and attack effectiveness across different viewpoints of stereo cameras. To cope with the disparity effect of these cameras, we also propose a new 3D stereo matching rendering module that allows the PAE to be aligned with real-world positions and headings in binocular vision.

While traditional methods estimate the human in image coordinates, many applications require human motion to be estimated in world coordinates. This is particularly challenging when there is both human and camera motion. Progress on this topic has been limited by the lack of rich video data with ground truth human and camera movement. We address this with BEDLAM2.0, a new dataset that goes beyond the popular BEDLAM dataset in important ways. In addition to introducing more diverse and realistic cameras and camera motions, BEDLAM2.0 increases diversity and realism of body shape, motions, clothing, hair, and 3D environments. Additionally, it adds shoes, which were missing in BEDLAM. BEDLAM has become a key resource for training 3D human pose and motion regressors today and we show that BEDLAM2.0 is significantly better, particularly for training methods that estimate humans in world coordinates. We compare state-of-the art methods trained on BEDLAM and BEDLAM2.0, and find that BEDLAM2.0 significantly improves accuracy over BEDLAM.

Existing methods face a fundamental dilemma. On one hand, projecting all domains into a single unified visual space leads to inter-domain interference and semantic distortion, as large shifts may vary with not only visual appearance but also underlying semantics. On the other hand, isolating domain-specific parameters causes knowledge fragmentation, creating \"knowledge islands\" that hamper knowledge reuse and exacerbate forgetting. To address this issue, we propose LAVA (Language-Anchored Visual Alignment), a novel DIL framework that replaces direct feature alignment with relative alignment driven by a text-based reference anchor. LAVA guides the visual representations of each incoming domain to preserve a consistent relative geometry, which is defined by mirroring the pairwise semantic similarities between the class names. This anchored geometric structure acts as a bridge across domains, enabling the retrieval of class-aware prior knowledge and facilitating robust feature aggregation.

Traditional methods for locating landmarks are time-consuming and require specialized knowledge and expertise. Current methods utilize superimposition and deep learning-based methods that employ automatic annotation of landmarks. However, these methods are not reliable due to insufficient large-scale validation studies. In this paper, we proposed a novel framework Cranio-ID: First, an automatic annotation of landmarks on 2D skulls (which are X-ray scans of faces) with their respective optical images using our trained YOLO-pose models. Second, cross-modal matching by formulating these landmarks into graph representations and then finding semantic correspondence between graphs of these two modalities using cross-attention and optimal transport framework. Our proposed framework is validated on the S2F and CUHK datasets (CUHK dataset resembles with S2F dataset).

To explore the ecological advantages of such staged \"visual diets\", we train self-supervised learning (SSL) models on object-centric videos under constraints that simulate infant vision: grayscale-to-color (C), blur-to-sharp (A), and preserved temporal continuity (T)-collectively termed CATDiet. For evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark across ten datasets, covering clean and corrupted image recognition, texture-shape cue conflict tests, silhouette recognition, depth-order classification, and the visual cliff paradigm. All CATDiet variants demonstrate enhanced robustness in object recognition, despite being trained solely on object-centric videos. Remarkably, models also exhibit biologically aligned developmental patterns, including neural plasticity changes mirroring synaptic density in macaque V1 and behaviors resembling infants' visual cliff responses. Building on these insights, CombDiet initializes SSL with CATDiet before standard training while preserving temporal continuity. Trained on object-centric or head-mounted infant videos, CombDiet outperforms standard SSL on both in-domain and out-of-domain object recognition and depth perception. Together, these results suggest that the developmental progression of early infant visual experience offers a powerful reverse-engineering framework for understanding the emergence of robust visual intelligence in machines.

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, they typically process videos largely in a single-pass manner with limited support for evidence revisit and iterative refinement. While recently emerging agent-based methods enable long-horizon reasoning, they either depend heavily on expensive proprietary models or require extensive agentic RL training. To overcome these limitations, we propose Agentic Video Intelligence (AVI), a flexible and training-free framework that can mirror human video comprehension through system-level design and optimization. AVI introduces three key innovations: (1) a human-inspired three-phase reasoning process (Retrieve-Perceive-Review) that ensures both sufficient global exploration and focused local analysis, (2) a structured video knowledge base organized through entity graphs, along with multi-granularity integrated tools, constituting the agent's interaction environment, and (3) an open-source model ensemble combining reasoning LLMs with lightweight base CV models and VLM, eliminating dependence on proprietary APIs or RL training. Experiments on LVBench, VideoMME-Long, LongVideoBench, and Charades-STA demonstrate that AVI achieves competitive performance while offering superior interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Agentic Video Intelligence (AVI)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u667a\u80fd\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u68c0\u7d22-\u611f\u77e5-\u8bc4\u5ba1\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89c6\u9891\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e3b\u8981\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u6b21\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bc1\u636e\u91cd\u8bbf\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "method": "AVI\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u521b\u65b0\uff1a1\uff09\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08\u68c0\u7d22-\u611f\u77e5-\u8bc4\u5ba1\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u4f53\u56fe\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89c6\u9891\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u548c\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u96c6\u6210\u5de5\u5177\uff1b3\uff09\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u63a8\u7406LLM\u4e0e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u57fa\u7840CV\u6a21\u578b\u548cVLM\u3002", "result": "\u5728LVBench\u3001VideoMME-Long\u3001LongVideoBench\u548cCharades-STA\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cAVI\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "AVI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u667a\u80fd\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e13\u6709API\u6216\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002"}}

To measure real-world generalization, we adopt leakage-safe blockwise hold-outs (vertical/horizontal) with safety buffers and report metrics only on held-out cores.

The task is particularly challenging for smallholder farms, where accurate delineation requires the use of high resolution (HR) imagery which are available only at low revisit frequencies (e.g., annually). To support more frequent (sub-) seasonal monitoring, HR images could be combined as references (ref) with low resolution (LR) images -- having higher revisit frequency (e.g., weekly) -- using reference-based super-resolution (Ref-SR) methods. However, current Ref-SR methods optimize perceptual quality and smooth over crucial features needed for downstream tasks, and are unable to meet the large scale-factor requirements for this task. Further, previous two-step approaches of SR followed by segmentation do not effectively utilize diverse satellite sources as inputs. We address these problems through a new approach, $\\textbf{SEED-SR}$, which uses a combination of conditional latent diffusion models and large-scale multi-spectral, multi-source geo-spatial foundation models.

However, generalization is still a key limitation for the current system, which refers to the ability to handle unseen scenarios or unfamiliar sensor configurations.Related works have explored the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to address few-shot or zero-shot tasks. While promising, these methods introduce a new challenge: the emergence of a hybrid AD system, where two distinct systems are used to plan a trajectory, leading to potential inconsistencies. Alternative research directions have explored Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks that generate control actions from VLM directly. However, these end-to-end solutions demonstrate prohibitive computational demands. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Risk Semantic Distillation (RSD), a novel framework that leverages VLMs to enhance the training of End-to-End (E2E) AD backbones. By providing risk attention for key objects, RSD addresses the issue of generalization. Specifically, we introduce RiskHead, a plug-in module that distills causal risk estimates from Vision-Language Models into Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features, yielding interpretable risk-attention maps.This approach allows BEV features to learn richer and more nuanced risk attention representations, which directly enhance the model's ability to handle spatial boundaries and risky objects.By focusing on risk attention, RSD aligns better with human-like driving behavior, which is essential to navigate in complex and dynamic environments. Our experiments on the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of RSD in managing complex and unpredictable driving conditions.

However, this comes at the price of a deterioration in image quality due to the low dose of radiation used to reduce the risk of secondary cancer development. While some efficient methods have been proposed to enhance LDCT quality, many overestimate noise and perform excessive smoothing, leading to a loss of critical details. In this paper, we introduce D-PerceptCT, a novel architecture inspired by key principles of the Human Visual System (HVS) to enhance LDCT images. The objective is to guide the model to enhance or preserve perceptually relevant features, thereby providing radiologists with CT images where critical anatomical structures and fine pathological details are perceptu- ally visible. D-PerceptCT consists of two main blocks: 1) a Visual Dual-path Extractor (ViDex), which integrates semantic priors from a pretrained DINOv2 model with local spatial features, allowing the network to incorporate semantic-awareness during enhancement; (2) a Global-Local State-Space block that captures long-range information and multiscale features to preserve the important structures and fine details for diagnosis. In addition, we propose a novel deep perceptual loss, designated as the Deep Perceptual Relevancy Loss Function (DPRLF), which is inspired by human contrast sensitivity, to further emphasize perceptually important features. Extensive experiments on the Mayo2016 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of D-PerceptCT method for LDCT enhancement, showing better preservation of structural and textural information within LDCT images compared to SOTA methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "D-PerceptCT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u542f\u53d1\u7684LDCT\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5168\u5c40-\u5c40\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5757\u6765\u4fdd\u7559\u8bca\u65ad\u6240\u9700\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u6df1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u5f3a\u8c03\u611f\u77e5\u91cd\u8981\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "LDCT\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u56e0\u4f4e\u8f90\u5c04\u5242\u91cf\u800c\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\u5bfc\u81f4\u5173\u952e\u7ec6\u8282\u4e22\u5931\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u589e\u5f3a\u6216\u4fdd\u7559\u611f\u77e5\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u63d0\u4f9b\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u75c5\u7406\u7ec6\u8282\u6e05\u6670\u53ef\u89c1\u7684CT\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faD-PerceptCT\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u89c6\u89c9\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff08\u96c6\u6210\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3DINOv2\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\uff09\u548c\u5168\u5c40-\u5c40\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5757\uff08\u6355\u83b7\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6df1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728Mayo2016\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cD-PerceptCT\u5728LDCT\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4fdd\u7559LDCT\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "conclusion": "D-PerceptCT\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LDCT\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u8bca\u65ad\u5173\u952e\u7ec6\u8282\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684CT\u56fe\u50cf\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose decoupled VAE (DeCo-VAE) to achieve compact latent representation.

To avoid cross-component interference, we design dedicated encoders for each decoupled component and adopt a shared 3D decoder to maintain spatiotemporal consistency during reconstruction. We further utilize a decoupled adaptation strategy that freezes partial encoders while training the others sequentially, ensuring stable training and accurate learning of both static and dynamic features.

An SDF is an implicit function that can query signed distances at specific coordinates for recovering a 3D surface. Although implicit functions work well on a single shape or scene, they pose obstacles when analyzing multiple SDFs with high-fidelity geometry details, due to the limited information encoded in the latent space for SDFs and the loss of geometry details. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce a method to represent multiple SDFs in a common space, aiming to recover more high-fidelity geometry details with more compact latent representations. Our key idea is to take full advantage of the benefits of generalization-based and overfitting-based learning strategies, which manage to preserve high-fidelity geometry details with compact latent codes. Based on this framework, we also introduce a novel sampling strategy to sample training queries. The sampling can improve the training efficiency and eliminate artifacts caused by the influence of other SDFs.

We follow the trend of dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting based methods, and address several significant challenges. To model complex hand-object interaction with mutual occlusion and edge blur, we present interaction-aware hand-object Gaussians with newly introduced optimizable parameters aiming to adopt piecewise linear hypothesis for clearer structural representation. Moreover, considering the complementarity and tightness of hand shape and object shape during interaction dynamics, we incorporate hand information into object deformation field, constructing interaction-aware dynamic fields to model flexible motions. To further address difficulties in the optimization process, we propose a progressive strategy that handles dynamic regions and static background step by step. Correspondingly, explicit regularizations are designed to stabilize the hand-object representations for smooth motion transition, physical interaction reality, and coherent lighting.

Single-stream CNNs fail to capture multi-scale forgery artifacts across spatial, texture, and frequency domains, limiting robustness and generalization. We introduce the ForensicFlow, a tri-modal forensic framework that synergistically fuses RGB, texture, and frequency evidence for video Deepfake detection. The RGB branch (ConvNeXt-tiny) extracts global visual inconsistencies; the texture branch (Swin Transformer-tiny) detects fine-grained blending artifacts; the frequency branch (CNN + SE) identifies periodic spectral noise. Attention-based temporal pooling dynamically prioritizes high-evidence frames, while adaptive attention fusion balances branch contributions.Trained on Celeb-DF (v2) with Focal Loss, ForensicFlow achieves AUC 0.9752, F1-Score 0.9408, and accuracy 0.9208, outperforming single-stream baselines. Ablation validates branch synergy; Grad-CAM confirms forensic focus.

Specifically, OmniZip first identifies salient audio tokens, then computes an audio retention score for each time group to capture information density, thereby dynamically guiding video token pruning and preserving cues from audio anchors enhanced by cross-modal similarity. For each time window, OmniZip compresses the video tokens using an interleaved spatio-temporal scheme.

Our results show that the predicted lesion loads are in line with the reference WMH estimates, confirming the robustness to variations in lesion load, acquisition, and demographics. Beyond accurate segmentation, we quantify WMH load within anatomically defined regions and combine these measures with brain structure volumes to assess diagnostic value. Regional WMH volumes consistently outperform global lesion burden for disease classification, and integration with brain atrophy metrics further improves performance, reaching area under the curve (AUC) values up to 0.97. Several spatially distinct regions, particularly within anterior white matter tracts, are reproducibly associated with diagnostic status, indicating localized vulnerability in AD.

While integrating complementary information from various MRI sequences is a common practice, the frequent absence of one or more modalities in real-world clinical settings poses a significant challenge, severely compromising the performance and generalizability of deep learning-based segmentation models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Cross-Modal Compositional Self-Distillation (CCSD) framework that can flexibly handle arbitrary combinations of input modalities. CCSD adopts a shared-specific encoder-decoder architecture and incorporates two self-distillation strategies: (i) a hierarchical modality self-distillation mechanism that transfers knowledge across modality hierarchies to reduce semantic discrepancies, and (ii) a progressive modality combination distillation approach that enhances robustness to missing modalities by simulating gradual modality dropout during training. Extensive experiments on public brain tumor segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that CCSD achieves state-of-the-art performance across various missing-modality scenarios, with strong generalization and stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7ec4\u5408\u81ea\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6CCSD\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u8111\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u4efb\u610f\u6a21\u6001\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u6a21\u6001\u81ea\u84b8\u998f\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u6a21\u6001\u7ec4\u5408\u84b8\u998f\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001MRI\u8111\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6216\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5171\u4eab-\u7279\u5b9a\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u79cd\u81ea\u84b8\u998f\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u6a21\u6001\u81ea\u84b8\u998f\u673a\u5236\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u6a21\u6001\u7ec4\u5408\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u6a21\u62df\u9010\u6e10\u4e22\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5171\u8111\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u5272\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCCSD\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CCSD\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u7075\u6d3b\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u610f\u8f93\u5165\u6a21\u6001\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u8111\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

While tabular predictors provide robust markers of global risk, their ability to capture subtle brain changes remains limited. In this study, we evaluate the predictive contributions of tabular and imaging-based representations, with a focus on transformer-derived Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) embeddings. We introduce a trajectory-aware labeling strategy based on Dynamic Time Warping clustering to capture heterogeneous patterns of cognitive change, and train a 3D Vision Transformer (ViT) via unsupervised reconstruction on harmonized and augmented MRI data to obtain anatomy-preserving embeddings without progression labels. The pretrained encoder embeddings are subsequently assessed using both traditional machine learning classifiers and deep learning heads, and compared against tabular representations and convolutional network baselines. Results highlight complementary strengths across modalities. Clinical and volumetric features achieved the highest AUCs of around 0.70 for predicting mild and severe progression, underscoring their utility in capturing global decline trajectories. In contrast, MRI embeddings from the ViT model were most effective in distinguishing cognitively stable individuals with an AUC of 0.71. However, all approaches struggled in the heterogeneous moderate group. These findings indicate that clinical features excel in identifying high-risk extremes, whereas transformer-based MRI embeddings are more sensitive to subtle markers of stability, motivating multimodal fusion strategies for AD progression modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eMRI\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u8ba4\u77e5\u8870\u9000\u4e2d\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8transformer\u884d\u751f\u7684MRI\u5d4c\u5165\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u4e34\u5e8a\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u6781\u7aef\u75c5\u4f8b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u7684MRI\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6807\u8bb0\u66f4\u654f\u611f\u3002", "motivation": "\u51c6\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u8870\u9000\u5bf9\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u5206\u5c42\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7ba1\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u8868\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u4f9b\u5168\u5c40\u98ce\u9669\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u4f46\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u5fae\u8111\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u89c4\u6574\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u611f\u77e5\u6807\u8bb0\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u91cd\u5efa\u5728\u534f\u8c03\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u7684MRI\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec33D Vision Transformer\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5934\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u4e34\u5e8a\u548c\u4f53\u79ef\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u8f7b\u5ea6\u548c\u91cd\u5ea6\u8fdb\u5c55\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u7ea60.70\u7684\u6700\u9ad8AUC\uff0c\u800cViT\u6a21\u578b\u7684MRI\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u533a\u5206\u8ba4\u77e5\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e2a\u4f53\u65b9\u9762\u6700\u6709\u6548\uff0cAUC\u4e3a0.71\u3002\u6240\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u4e2d\u7b49\u7ec4\u4e2d\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e34\u5e8a\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u6781\u7aef\u75c5\u4f8b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u7684MRI\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6807\u8bb0\u66f4\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u8fd9\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86AD\u8fdb\u5c55\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Most predictive algorithms that infer ST directly from histology treat each section independently and ignore 3D structure, while existing 3D-aware approaches are not generative and do not scale well. We present Holographic Tissue Expression Inpainting and Analysis (HoloTea), a 3D-aware flow-matching framework that imputes spot-level gene expression from H&E while explicitly using information from adjacent sections. Our key idea is to retrieve morphologically corresponding spots on neighboring slides in a shared feature space and fuse this cross section context into a lightweight ControlNet, allowing conditioning to follow anatomical continuity. To better capture the count nature of the data, we introduce a 3D-consistent prior for flow matching that combines a learned zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) prior with a spatial-empirical prior constructed from neighboring sections.

Vision-based fall prediction systems offer a non-invasive solution to anticipate falls seconds before impact, but their development is hindered by the scarcity of available fall data. Contributing to these efforts, this study proposes the Biomechanical Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (BioST-GCN), a dual-stream model that combines both pose and biomechanical information using a cross-attention fusion mechanism. Our model outperforms the vanilla ST-GCN baseline by 5.32% and 2.91% F1-score on the simulated MCF-UA stunt-actor and MUVIM datasets, respectively. The spatio-temporal attention mechanisms in the ST-GCN stream also provide interpretability by identifying critical joints and temporal phases. However, a critical simulation-reality gap persists. While our model achieves an 89.0% F1-score with full supervision on simulated data, zero-shot generalization to unseen subjects drops to 35.9%. This performance decline is likely due to biases in simulated data, such as `intent-to-fall' cues. For older adults, particularly those with diabetes or frailty, this gap is exacerbated by their unique kinematic profiles. To address this, we propose personalization strategies and advocate for privacy-preserving data pipelines to enable real-world validation. Our findings underscore the urgent need to bridge the gap between simulated and real-world data to develop effective fall prediction systems for vulnerable elderly populations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86BioST-GCN\u53cc\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u59ff\u6001\u548c\u751f\u7269\u529b\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u8dcc\u5012\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6a21\u62df-\u73b0\u5b9e\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "\u8dcc\u5012\u5bf9\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u9020\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u4f24\u5bb3\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u8dcc\u5012\u9884\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u5b9e\u8dcc\u5012\u6570\u636e\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBiomechanical Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (BioST-GCN)\u53cc\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u7ed3\u5408\u59ff\u6001\u548c\u751f\u7269\u529b\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6bd4ST-GCN\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u9ad85.32%\u548c2.91% F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u964d\u81f335.9%\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6a21\u62df-\u73b0\u5b9e\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u5f25\u5408\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u4e3a\u8106\u5f31\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u7fa4\u5f00\u53d1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8dcc\u5012\u9884\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Project page: https://miya-oi.github.io/SparseSurf-project", "summary": "Recent advances in optimizing Gaussian Splatting for scene geometry have enabled efficient reconstruction of detailed surfaces from images. However, when input views are sparse, such optimization is prone to overfitting, leading to suboptimal reconstruction quality. Existing approaches address this challenge by employing flattened Gaussian primitives to better fit surface geometry, combined with depth regularization to alleviate geometric ambiguities under limited viewpoints. Nevertheless, the increased anisotropy inherent in flattened Gaussians exacerbates overfitting in sparse-view scenarios, hindering accurate surface fitting and degrading novel view synthesis performance. In this paper, we propose \\net{}, a method that reconstructs more accurate and detailed surfaces while preserving high-quality novel view rendering. Our key insight is to introduce Stereo Geometry-Texture Alignment, which bridges rendering quality and geometry estimation, thereby jointly enhancing both surface reconstruction and view synthesis. In addition, we present a Pseudo-Feature Enhanced Geometry Consistency that enforces multi-view geometric consistency by incorporating both training and unseen views, effectively mitigating overfitting caused by sparse supervision.

We propose SLAM-AGS, a Slide-Label-Aware Multitask pretraining framework that jointly optimizes (i) a weakly supervised similarity objective on slide-negative patches and (ii) a self-supervised contrastive objective on slide-positive patches, yielding stronger performance on downstream tasks. To stabilize learning, we apply Adaptive Gradient Surgery to tackle conflicting task gradients and prevent model collapse. We integrate the pretrained encoder into an attention-based Multiple Instance Learning aggregator for bag-level prediction and attention-guided retrieval of the most abnormal instances in a bag. On a publicly available bone-marrow cytology dataset, with simulated witness rates from 10% down to 0.5%, SLAM-AGS improves bag-level F1-Score and Top 400 positive cell retrieval over other pretraining methods, with the largest gains at low witness rates, showing that resolving gradient interference enables stable pretraining and better performance on downstream tasks.

Submitted to ISBI2026", "summary": "Doppler holography is an emerging retinal imaging technique that captures the dynamic behavior of blood flow with high temporal resolution, enabling quantitative assessment of retinal hemodynamics. This requires accurate segmentation of retinal arteries and veins, but traditional segmentation methods focus solely on spatial information and overlook the temporal richness of holographic data. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective approach for artery-vein segmentation in temporal Doppler holograms using standard segmentation architectures. By incorporating features derived from a dedicated pulse analysis pipeline, our method allows conventional U-Nets to exploit temporal dynamics and achieve performance comparable to more complex attention- or iteration-based models. These findings demonstrate that time-resolved preprocessing can unlock the full potential of deep learning for Doppler holography, opening new perspectives for quantitative exploration of retinal hemodynamics.
