To address\nthese limitations, we propose CWNet (Causal Wavelet Network), a novel\narchitecture that leverages wavelet transforms for causal reasoning.\nSpecifically, our approach comprises two key components: 1) Inspired by the\nconcept of intervention in causality, we adopt a causal reasoning perspective\nto reveal the underlying causal relationships in low-light enhancement. From a\nglobal perspective, we employ a metric learning strategy to ensure causal\nembeddings adhere to causal principles, separating them from non-causal\nconfounding factors while focusing on the invariance of causal factors. At the\nlocal level, we introduce an instance-level CLIP semantic loss to precisely\nmaintain causal factor consistency. 2) Based on our causal analysis, we present\na wavelet transform-based backbone network that effectively optimizes the\nrecovery of frequency information, ensuring precise enhancement tailored to the\nspecific attributes of wavelet transforms.

Recent nested Transformer architectures mitigate this by embedding\nnested subnetworks within a single model to enable scalable inference. However,\nthese models allocate the same amount of compute to all inputs, regardless of\ntheir complexity, which leads to inefficiencies. To address this, we introduce\nThinkingViT, a nested ViT architecture that employs progressive thinking stages\nto dynamically adjust inference computation based on input difficulty.\nThinkingViT initiates inference by activating a small subset of the most\nimportant attention heads and terminates early if predictions reach sufficient\ncertainty. Otherwise, it activates additional attention heads and re-evaluates\nthe input. At the core of ThinkingViT is our Token Recycling mechanism, which\nconditions each subsequent inference stage on the embeddings from the previous\nstage, enabling progressive improvement.

Existing methods often rely on\nfully supervised learning, which requires costly ground-truth pose annotations.\nIn this work, we propose GeoDistill, a Geometry guided weakly supervised self\ndistillation framework that uses teacher-student learning with Field-of-View\n(FoV)-based masking to enhance local feature learning for robust cross-view\nlocalization. In GeoDistill, the teacher model localizes a panoramic image,\nwhile the student model predicts locations from a limited FoV counterpart\ncreated by FoV-based masking. By aligning the student's predictions with those\nof the teacher, the student focuses on key features like lane lines and ignores\ntextureless regions, such as roads. This results in more accurate predictions\nand reduced uncertainty, regardless of whether the query images are panoramas\nor limited FoV images. Our experiments show that GeoDistill significantly\nimproves localization performance across different frameworks. Additionally, we\nintroduce a novel orientation estimation network that predicts relative\norientation without requiring precise planar position ground truth.

Applying this framework to\nthe judicial system, we compile an extensive dataset, JudiFair, comprising\n177,100 unique case facts.

Particularly, LLMs display notably more\npronounced biases on demographic labels, with slightly less bias on substance\nlabels compared to procedure ones. Interestingly, increased inconsistency\ncorrelates with reduced biases, but more accurate predictions exacerbate\nbiases. While we find that adjusting the temperature parameter can influence\nLLM fairness, model size, release date, and country of origin do not exhibit\nsignificant effects on judicial fairness.

The Content Injection\nModule inputs the severely degraded image, while the Identity Injection Module\nintegrates the specific identity from a given image. Subsequently, RIDFR\nincorporates Alignment Learning, which aligns the restoration results from\nmultiple references with the same identity in order to suppress the\ninterference of ID-irrelevant face semantics (e.g. pose, expression, make-up,\nhair style). Experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods, reconstructing high-quality ID-specific results with\nhigh identity fidelity and demonstrating strong robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "RIDFR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b0\u578bID\u7279\u5b9a\u4eba\u8138\u4fee\u590d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u5bb9\u6ce8\u5165\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u6ce8\u5165\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u9f50\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4eba\u8138\u4fee\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u9762\u5bf9\u8eab\u4efd\u6a21\u7cca\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u968f\u673a\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u65f6\u3002", "method": "RIDFR\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5185\u5bb9\u6ce8\u5165\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u6ce8\u5165\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u9f50\u5b66\u4e60\u6291\u5236ID\u65e0\u5173\u8bed\u4e49\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRIDFR\u5728\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "RIDFR\u4e3aID\u7279\u5b9a\u4eba\u8138\u4fee\u590d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Existing methods predominantly rely on spatial-domain features\nto capture long-range dependencies, which are computationally expensive and\noften inadequate under complex haze conditions. While some approaches introduce\nfrequency-domain cues, the weak coupling between spatial and frequency branches\nlimits the overall performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose the\nDark Channel Guided Frequency-aware Dehazing Network (DGFDNet), a novel\ndual-domain framework that performs physically guided degradation alignment\nacross spatial and frequency domains. At its core, the DGFDBlock comprises two\nkey modules: 1) the Haze-Aware Frequency Modulator (HAFM), which generates a\npixel-level haze confidence map from dark channel priors to adaptively enhance\nhaze-relevant frequency components, thereby achieving global degradation-aware\nspectral modulation; 2) the Multi-level Gating Aggregation Module (MGAM), which\nfuses multi-scale features through diverse convolutional kernels and hybrid\ngating mechanisms to recover fine structural details. Additionally, a Prior\nCorrection Guidance Branch (PCGB) incorporates a closed-loop feedback\nmechanism, enabling iterative refinement of the prior by intermediate dehazed\nfeatures and significantly improving haze localization accuracy, especially in\nchallenging outdoor scenes.

Collecting accurate\nsurface geometry data from the foot and ankle during dynamic gait conditions is\ninherently challenging due to swing foot occlusions and viewing limitations.\nThus, this paper introduces FootGait3D, a novel multi-view dataset of\nhigh-resolution ankle-foot surface point clouds captured during natural gait.\nDifferent from existing gait datasets that typically target whole-body or\nlower-limb motion, FootGait3D focuses specifically on the detailed modeling of\nthe ankle-foot region, offering a finer granularity of motion data. To address\nthis, FootGait3D consists of 8,403 point cloud frames collected from 46\nsubjects using a custom five-camera depth sensing system. Each frame includes a\ncomplete 5-view reconstruction of the foot and ankle (serving as ground truth)\nalong with partial point clouds obtained from only four, three, or two views.\nThis structured variation enables rigorous evaluation of 3D point cloud\ncompletion methods under varying occlusion levels and viewpoints.

To this end, we present DIJA, the first\nsystematic study and jailbreak attack framework that exploits unique safety\nweaknesses of dLLMs. Specifically, our proposed DIJA constructs adversarial\ninterleaved mask-text prompts that exploit the text generation mechanisms of\ndLLMs, i.e., bidirectional modeling and parallel decoding. Bidirectional\nmodeling drives the model to produce contextually consistent outputs for masked\nspans, even when harmful, while parallel decoding limits model dynamic\nfiltering and rejection sampling of unsafe content. This causes standard\nalignment mechanisms to fail, enabling harmful completions in alignment-tuned\ndLLMs, even when harmful behaviors or unsafe instructions are directly exposed\nin the prompt. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that DIJA\nsignificantly outperforms existing jailbreak methods, exposing a previously\noverlooked threat surface in dLLM architectures.

However, its inherent reliance on paired\nimage-text input, which we refer to as ``textual reliance\", presents two\nfundamental limitations: 1) many medical segmentation datasets lack paired\nreports, leaving a substantial portion of image-only data underutilized for\ntraining; and 2) inference is limited to retrospective analysis of cases with\npaired reports, limiting its applicability in most clinical scenarios where\nsegmentation typically precedes reporting. To address these limitations, we\npropose ProLearn, the first Prototype-driven Learning framework for\nlanguage-guided segmentation that fundamentally alleviates textual reliance. At\nits core, in ProLearn, we introduce a novel Prototype-driven Semantic\nApproximation (PSA) module to enable approximation of semantic guidance from\ntextual input. PSA initializes a discrete and compact prototype space by\ndistilling segmentation-relevant semantics from textual reports. Once\ninitialized, it supports a query-and-respond mechanism which approximates\nsemantic guidance for images without textual input, thereby alleviating textual\nreliance.

First, we introduce a\nrobust 3D mask generation module with our 3D-Geometry Aware Label Prediction\n(3D-GALP), which uses spherical harmonics (SH) coefficients to model\nview-dependent label variations and soft-label property, yielding accurate and\nconsistent part segmentations across viewpoints.

The key\ntechniques include: (i) A joint angle-based model of human pose, which is\nrobust to describe kinematic human poses; (ii) Approximating temporal variation\nof joint angles through high order Fourier series to get reliable \"ground\ntruth\"; (iii) A bidirectional recurrent network is designed as a\npost-processing module to refine the estimation of well-established HRNet.\nTrained with the high-quality dataset constructed using our method, the network\ndemonstrates outstanding performance to correct wrongly recognized joints and\nsmooth their spatiotemporal trajectories. Tests show that joint angle-based\nrefinement (JAR) outperforms the state-of-the-art HPE refinement network in\nchallenging cases like figure skating and breaking.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5173\u8282\u89d2\u5ea6\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u65e0\u6807\u8bb0\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08HPE\uff09\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u8bc6\u522b\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u6ce2\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709HPE\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u8282\u89d2\u5ea6\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u9ad8\u9636\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u7ea7\u6570\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5173\u8282\u89d2\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cc\u5411\u5faa\u73af\u7f51\u7edc\u4f5c\u4e3a\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u82b1\u6837\u6ed1\u51b0\u548c\u8857\u821e\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u6027\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0cJAR\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709HPE\u6539\u8fdb\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5173\u8282\u89d2\u5ea6\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86HPE\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

To push\nthe boundaries of performance, we have scaled up the training dataset to over\n500K samples, encompassing diverse objects, keypoint categories, image styles,\nand scenarios with complex occlusions. This extensive scaling enables KptLLM++\nto unlock its potential, achieving remarkable accuracy and generalization.\nComprehensive experiments on multiple keypoint detection benchmarks demonstrate\nits state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its potential as a unified\nsolution for fine-grained image understanding and its transformative\nimplications for human-AI interaction.", "AI": {"tldr": "KptLLM++\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u6307\u4ee4\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u7528\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MLLMs\u5728\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u7269\u4f53\u5173\u952e\u70b9\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u800c\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u5bf9\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u3001\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc6\u522b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u201c\u8bc6\u522b-\u68c0\u6d4b\u201d\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5148\u89e3\u91ca\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5176\u7cbe\u786e\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u81f350\u4e07\u6837\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "KptLLM++\u4e3a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u53d8\u9769\u3002"}}

Their inherent\nambiguity or similarity, coupled with the lack of explicit definitions, makes\nthem a fundamental bottleneck. These issues not only limit the design of\ntargeted learning strategies but also diminish the model's robustness under\nclothing or viewpoint changes. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmultimodal-guided Hard Sample Generation and Learning (HSGL) framework, which\nis the first effort to unify textual and visual modalities to explicitly\ndefine, generate, and optimize hard samples within a unified paradigm. HSGL\ncomprises two core components: (1) Dual-Granularity Hard Sample Generation\n(DGHSG), which leverages multimodal cues to synthesize semantically consistent\nsamples, including both coarse- and fine-grained hard positives and negatives\nfor effectively increasing the hardness and diversity of the training data. (2)\nHard Sample Adaptive Learning (HSAL), which introduces a hardness-aware\noptimization strategy that adjusts feature distances based on textual semantic\nlabels, encouraging the separation of hard positives and drawing hard negatives\ncloser in the embedding space to enhance the model's discriminative capability\nand robustness to hard samples.

Therefore, our\nresearch integrates the knowledge and abilities of LLM and human experts to\naddress the limitations of novelty assessment. The most common novelty in\nacademic papers is the introduction of new methods. In this paper, we propose\nleveraging human knowledge and LLM to assist pretrained language models (PLMs,\ne.g. BERT etc.) in predicting the method novelty of papers. Specifically, we\nextract sentences related to the novelty of the academic paper from peer review\nreports and use LLM to summarize the methodology section of the academic paper,\nwhich are then used to fine-tune PLMs. In addition, we have designed a\ntext-guided fusion module with novel Sparse-Attention to better integrate human\nand LLM knowledge.

Using densely acquired rotational X-ray arrays, CT can capture 3D\nspatial features. However, it is confronted with challenged such as significant\ntime consumption and high radiation exposure. CT reconstruction methods based\non sparse-view X-ray images have garnered substantial attention from\nresearchers as they present a means to mitigate costs and risks. In recent\nyears, diffusion models, particularly the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), have\ndemonstrated promising potential in the domain of 3D CT reconstruction.\nNonetheless, due to the substantial differences between the 2D latent\nrepresentation of X-ray modalities and the 3D latent representation of CT\nmodalities, the vanilla LDM is incapable of achieving effective alignment\nwithin the latent space. To address this issue, we propose the Consistent\nLatent Space Diffusion Model (CLS-DM), which incorporates cross-modal feature\ncontrastive learning to efficiently extract latent 3D information from 2D X-ray\nimages and achieve latent space alignment between modalities. Experimental\nresults indicate that CLS-DM outperforms classical and state-of-the-art\ngenerative models in terms of standard voxel-level metrics (PSNR, SSIM) on the\nLIDC-IDRI and CTSpine1K datasets. This methodology not only aids in enhancing\nthe effectiveness and economic viability of sparse X-ray reconstructed CT but\ncan also be generalized to other cross-modal transformation tasks, such as\ntext-to-image synthesis.

Previous work has attempted to\ncompare these architectures, but is forced to make comparisons with models that\nhave different numbers of parameters, training techniques, and datasets. We\nintroduce the SOTA open-data Ettin suite of models: paired encoder-only and\ndecoder-only models ranging from 17 million parameters to 1 billion, trained on\nup to 2 trillion tokens. Using the same recipe for both encoder-only and\ndecoder-only models produces SOTA recipes in both categories for their\nrespective sizes, beating ModernBERT as an encoder and Llama 3.2 and SmolLM2 as\ndecoders. Like previous work, we find that encoder-only models excel at\nclassification and retrieval tasks while decoders excel at generative tasks.\nHowever, we show that adapting a decoder model to encoder tasks (and vice\nversa) through continued training is subpar compared to using only the reverse\nobjective (i.e. a 400M encoder outperforms a 1B decoder on MNLI, and vice versa\nfor generative tasks).

However, the scarcity of smoke image\ndata from forest fires is one of the significant factors hindering the\ndetection of forest fire smoke. Image generation models offer a promising\nsolution for synthesizing realistic smoke images. However, current inpainting\nmodels exhibit limitations in generating high-quality smoke representations,\nparticularly manifesting as inconsistencies between synthesized smoke and\nbackground contexts. To solve these problems, we proposed a comprehensive\nframework for generating forest fire smoke images. Firstly, we employed the\npre-trained segmentation model and the multimodal model to obtain smoke masks\nand image captions.Then, to address the insufficient utilization of masks and\nmasked images by inpainting models, we introduced a network architecture guided\nby mask and masked image features. We also proposed a new loss function, the\nmask random difference loss, which enhances the consistency of the generated\neffects around the mask by randomly expanding and eroding the mask\nedges.Finally, to generate a smoke image dataset using random masks for\nsubsequent detection tasks, we incorporated smoke characteristics and use a\nmultimodal large language model as a filtering tool to select diverse and\nreasonable smoke images, thereby improving the quality of the synthetic\ndataset.

However, existing methods struggle with disentangling\ntargets from anchors in complex multi-anchor queries and resolving\ninconsistencies in spatial descriptions caused by perspective variations. To\ntackle these challenges, we propose ViewSRD, a framework that formulates 3D\nvisual grounding as a structured multi-view decomposition process. First, the\nSimple Relation Decoupling (SRD) module restructures complex multi-anchor\nqueries into a set of targeted single-anchor statements, generating a\nstructured set of perspective-aware descriptions that clarify positional\nrelationships. These decomposed representations serve as the foundation for the\nMulti-view Textual-Scene Interaction (Multi-TSI) module, which integrates\ntextual and scene features across multiple viewpoints using shared, Cross-modal\nConsistent View Tokens (CCVTs) to preserve spatial correlations. Finally, a\nTextual-Scene Reasoning module synthesizes multi-view predictions into a\nunified and robust 3D visual grounding.

However,\nexisting MVS methods often struggle with challenging regions, such as\ntextureless regions and reflective surfaces, where feature matching fails. In\ncontrast, monocular depth estimation inherently does not require feature\nmatching, allowing it to achieve robust relative depth estimation in these\nregions. To bridge this gap, we propose MonoMVSNet, a novel monocular feature\nand depth guided MVS network that integrates powerful priors from a monocular\nfoundation model into multi-view geometry. Firstly, the monocular feature of\nthe reference view is integrated into source view features by the attention\nmechanism with a newly designed cross-view position encoding.

We thus propose a novel\n5-stage framework for decoding visual representations from EEG signals: (1) an\nEEG encoder for concept classification, (2) cross-modal alignment of EEG and\ntext embeddings in CLIP feature space, (3) caption refinement via re-ranking,\n(4) weighted interpolation of concept and caption embeddings for richer\nsemantics, and (5) image generation using a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model.\nWe enable context-aware EEG-to-image generation through cross-modal alignment\nand re-ranking. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates\nhigh-quality images aligned with visual stimuli, outperforming SOTA approaches\nby 13.43% in Classification Accuracy, 15.21% in Generation Accuracy and\nreducing Fr\\'echet Inception Distance by 36.61%, indicating superior semantic\nalignment and image quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd5\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4eceEEG\u4fe1\u53f7\u89e3\u7801\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u6392\u5e8f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684EEG\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "EEG\u4fe1\u53f7\u89e3\u7801\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "method": "5\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1aEEG\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u6807\u9898\u7ec6\u5316\u3001\u52a0\u6743\u63d2\u503c\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u534713.43%\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u534715.21%\uff0cFr\u00e9chet Inception Distance\u964d\u4f4e36.61%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002"}}

First, they fail to maintain consistent background details,\nwhich limits their applicability. Furthermore, when the foreground character\nundergoes large motion variations, inconsistencies in identity and clothing\ndetails become evident. To address these problems, we propose CharaConsist,\nwhich employs point-tracking attention and adaptive token merge along with\ndecoupled control of the foreground and background. CharaConsist enables\nfine-grained consistency for both foreground and background, supporting the\ngeneration of one character in continuous shots within a fixed scene or in\ndiscrete shots across different scenes. Moreover, CharaConsist is the first\nconsistent generation method tailored for text-to-image DiT model. Its ability\nto maintain fine-grained consistency, combined with the larger capacity of\nlatest base model, enables it to produce high-quality visual outputs,\nbroadening its applicability to a wider range of real-world scenarios.
