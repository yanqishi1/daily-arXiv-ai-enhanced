### [1] [MedBench-IT: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models on Italian Medical Entrance Examinations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07135)
*Ruggero Marino Lazzaroni,Alessandro Angioi,Michelangelo Puliga,Davide Sanna,Roberto Marras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedBench-IT是首个针对意大利医学入学考试的综合性基准测试，包含17,410道专家编写的选择题，涵盖6个学科和3个难度级别，用于评估LLM在意大利语医学教育领域的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在教育领域的应用潜力日益增长，但非英语语言在专业领域的基准测试仍然稀缺，特别是在意大利语医学教育领域缺乏标准化评估工具。

Method: 从领先的备考材料出版商Edizioni Simone收集17,410道选择题，涵盖6个学科和3个难度级别。评估包括专有LLM（GPT-4o、Claude系列）和参数小于30B的高效开源模型，进行准确性、可重复性测试、排序偏差分析和推理提示评估。

Result: 模型表现达到88.86%的响应一致性（因学科而异），排序偏差影响最小，发现题目可读性与模型性能之间存在统计显著但较小的负相关关系。

Conclusion: MedBench-IT为意大利NLP社区、教育技术开发者和从业者提供了重要资源，为该关键领域提供了当前能力洞察和标准化评估方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show increasing potential in education, yet
benchmarks for non-English languages in specialized domains remain scarce. We
introduce MedBench-IT, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs on
Italian medical university entrance examinations. Sourced from Edizioni Simone,
a leading preparatory materials publisher, MedBench-IT comprises 17,410
expert-written multiple-choice questions across six subjects (Biology,
Chemistry, Logic, General Culture, Mathematics, Physics) and three difficulty
levels. We evaluated diverse models including proprietary LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude
series) and resource-efficient open-source alternatives (<30B parameters)
focusing on practical deployability.
  Beyond accuracy, we conducted rigorous reproducibility tests (88.86% response
consistency, varying by subject), ordering bias analysis (minimal impact), and
reasoning prompt evaluation. We also examined correlations between question
readability and model performance, finding a statistically significant but
small inverse relationship. MedBench-IT provides a crucial resource for Italian
NLP community, EdTech developers, and practitioners, offering insights into
current capabilities and standardized evaluation methodology for this critical
domain.

### [3] [Toward Purpose-oriented Topic Model Evaluation enabled by Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07142)
*Zhiyin Tan,Jennifer D'Souza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个使用大语言模型自动评估动态演化主题模型的框架，包含9个基于LLM的指标，覆盖主题质量的四个关键维度，相比传统指标能更好地发现语义问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主题模型评估指标（如连贯性和多样性）只能捕捉狭窄的统计模式，无法解释实践中的语义失败，需要更有效的评估方法。

Method: 开发了基于LLM的评估框架，包含9个指标评估四个维度：词汇有效性、主题内语义合理性、主题间结构合理性和文档-主题对齐合理性，通过对抗性和采样协议验证。

Result: LLM指标提供了可解释、稳健且任务相关的评估，能够发现传统指标忽略的关键弱点（如冗余和语义漂移）。

Conclusion: 该框架支持开发可扩展的细粒度评估工具，用于维护动态数据集中的主题相关性。

Abstract: This study presents a framework for automated evaluation of dynamically
evolving topic models using Large Language Models (LLMs). Topic modeling is
essential for organizing and retrieving scholarly content in digital library
systems, helping users navigate complex and evolving knowledge domains.
However, widely used automated metrics, such as coherence and diversity, often
capture only narrow statistical patterns and fail to explain semantic failures
in practice. We introduce a purpose-oriented evaluation framework that employs
nine LLM-based metrics spanning four key dimensions of topic quality: lexical
validity, intra-topic semantic soundness, inter-topic structural soundness, and
document-topic alignment soundness. The framework is validated through
adversarial and sampling-based protocols, and is applied across datasets
spanning news articles, scholarly publications, and social media posts, as well
as multiple topic modeling methods and open-source LLMs. Our analysis shows
that LLM-based metrics provide interpretable, robust, and task-relevant
assessments, uncovering critical weaknesses in topic models such as redundancy
and semantic drift, which are often missed by traditional metrics. These
results support the development of scalable, fine-grained evaluation tools for
maintaining topic relevance in dynamic datasets. All code and data supporting
this work are accessible at

### [4] [Towards EnergyGPT: A Large Language Model Specialized for the Energy Sector](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07177)
*Amal Chebbi,Babajide Kolade*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EnergyGPT是基于LLaMA 3.1-8B微调的专业能源领域语言模型，在能源相关任务上表现优于基础模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用大语言模型在能源等专业领域效果有限，需要深度技术专业知识和精确领域知识

Method: 使用监督微调方法，在高质量能源文本语料上微调LLaMA 3.1-8B模型，包括数据收集、模型微调、基准设计等完整流程

Result: EnergyGPT在大多数能源相关语言理解和生成任务上优于基础模型，证明了训练策略的有效性

Conclusion: 通过领域专业化微调，可以在不需要大规模基础设施的情况下提升模型在专业领域的相关性和性能

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
various domains. However, their general-purpose nature often limits their
effectiveness in specialized fields such as energy, where deep technical
expertise and precise domain knowledge are essential. In this paper, we
introduce EnergyGPT, a domain-specialized language model tailored for the
energy sector, developed by fine-tuning LLaMA 3.1-8B model using Supervised
Fine-Tuning on a high-quality, curated corpus of energy-related texts. We
present a complete development pipeline, including data collection and
curation, model fine-tuning, benchmark design and LLM-judge choice, evaluation
and deployment. Through this work, we demonstrate that our training strategy
enables improvements in domain relevance and performance without the need for
large-scale infrastructure. By evaluating the performance of the model using
domain-specific question-answering benchmarks, our results demonstrate that
EnergyGPT outperforms the base model in most of the energy-related language
understanding and generation tasks.

### [5] [DischargeSim: A Simulation Benchmark for Educational Doctor-Patient Communication at Discharge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07188)
*Zonghai Yao,Michael Sun,Won Seok Jang,Sunjae Kwon,Soie Kwon,Hong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DischargeSim是一个新的基准测试，用于评估大型语言模型在出院沟通中作为个性化教育者的能力，通过多轮对话模拟和多项评估维度来测试模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM基准测试主要关注诊断推理，忽略了出院后患者教育这一关键环节，需要专门评估模型在出院沟通中的表现。

Method: 创建DischargeSim基准，模拟医患多轮对话，包含不同心理社会特征的患者角色，通过对话质量评估、个性化文档生成和患者理解测试三个维度来评估18个LLM模型。

Result: 实验显示LLM在出院教育能力上存在显著差距，性能因患者特征而异，模型大小并不总是带来更好的教育效果。

Conclusion: DischargeSim为评估LLM在临床后访教育中的表现提供了首个基准，有助于促进公平、个性化的患者支持。

Abstract: Discharge communication is a critical yet underexplored component of patient
care, where the goal shifts from diagnosis to education. While recent large
language model (LLM) benchmarks emphasize in-visit diagnostic reasoning, they
fail to evaluate models' ability to support patients after the visit. We
introduce DischargeSim, a novel benchmark that evaluates LLMs on their ability
to act as personalized discharge educators. DischargeSim simulates post-visit,
multi-turn conversations between LLM-driven DoctorAgents and PatientAgents with
diverse psychosocial profiles (e.g., health literacy, education, emotion).
Interactions are structured across six clinically grounded discharge topics and
assessed along three axes: (1) dialogue quality via automatic and LLM-as-judge
evaluation, (2) personalized document generation including free-text summaries
and structured AHRQ checklists, and (3) patient comprehension through a
downstream multiple-choice exam. Experiments across 18 LLMs reveal significant
gaps in discharge education capability, with performance varying widely across
patient profiles. Notably, model size does not always yield better education
outcomes, highlighting trade-offs in strategy use and content prioritization.
DischargeSim offers a first step toward benchmarking LLMs in post-visit
clinical education and promoting equitable, personalized patient support.

### [6] [Rule-Based Moral Principles for Explaining Uncertainty in Natural Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07190)
*Zahra Atf,Peter R Lewis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 基于道德原则的规则系统框架，通过预防、尊重、责任等道德规则来处理LLM中的不确定性，提供透明的解释和理由


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决概率方法在高风险场景下的不透明性问题，提供更符合道德原则和透明期望的不确定性处理方案

Method: 基于道德心理学和美德伦理学的见解，定义预防、尊重、责任等道德规则，在轻量级Prolog引擎中编码，根据不确定性级别触发对应系统动作和理由

Result: 通过场景模拟测试规则覆盖率、公平性和信任检验，临床和法律领域的应用案例证明道德推理能够提高信任和可解释性

Conclusion: 该方法为社会责任任的自然语言生成提供了一种透明、轻量级的替代方案，比概率模型更符合透明性期望

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes settings,
where explaining uncertainty is both technical and ethical. Probabilistic
methods are often opaque and misaligned with expectations of transparency. We
propose a framework based on rule-based moral principles for handling
uncertainty in LLM-generated text. Using insights from moral psychology and
virtue ethics, we define rules such as precaution, deference, and
responsibility to guide responses under epistemic or aleatoric uncertainty.
These rules are encoded in a lightweight Prolog engine, where uncertainty
levels (low, medium, high) trigger aligned system actions with plain-language
rationales. Scenario-based simulations benchmark rule coverage, fairness, and
trust calibration. Use cases in clinical and legal domains illustrate how moral
reasoning can improve trust and interpretability. Our approach offers a
transparent, lightweight alternative to probabilistic models for socially
responsible natural language generation.

### [7] [LLM Analysis of 150+ years of German Parliamentary Debates on Migration Reveals Shift from Post-War Solidarity to Anti-Solidarity in the Last Decade](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07274)
*Aida Kostikova,Ole Pütz,Steffen Eger,Olga Sabelfeld,Benjamin Paassen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用大型语言模型自动标注德国议会辩论中的（反）团结子类型，评估模型性能并分析二战后至今德国移民政策辩论中的团结趋势


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人工标注方法限制了大规模政治文本分析的深度和广度，需要自动化工具来分析德国议会关于移民问题的广泛辩论

Method: 评估多种大型语言模型在标注德国议会辩论中（反）团结子类型方面的表现，包括模型大小、提示差异、微调等因素的影响，并与数千个人工参考标注进行比较

Result: 发现模型能够有效自动化复杂标注任务，数据揭示了战后时期对移民的高度团结以及2015年以来德国议会中强烈的反团结趋势

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在政治文本分析中具有巨大潜力，德国移民辩论在人口下降和劳动力短缺与日益极化的背景下具有重要意义

Abstract: Migration has been a core topic in German political debate, from millions of
expellees post World War II over labor migration to refugee movements in the
recent past. Studying political speech regarding such wide-ranging phenomena in
depth traditionally required extensive manual annotations, limiting the scope
of analysis to small subsets of the data. Large language models (LLMs) have the
potential to partially automate even complex annotation tasks. We provide an
extensive evaluation of a multiple LLMs in annotating (anti-)solidarity
subtypes in German parliamentary debates compared to a large set of thousands
of human reference annotations (gathered over a year). We evaluate the
influence of model size, prompting differences, fine-tuning, historical versus
contemporary data; and we investigate systematic errors. Beyond methodological
evaluation, we also interpret the resulting annotations from a social science
lense, gaining deeper insight into (anti-)solidarity trends towards migrants in
the German post-World War II period and recent past. Our data reveals a high
degree of migrant-directed solidarity in the postwar period, as well as a
strong trend towards anti-solidarity in the German parliament since 2015,
motivating further research. These findings highlight the promise of LLMs for
political text analysis and the importance of migration debates in Germany,
where demographic decline and labor shortages coexist with rising polarization.

### [8] [Causal Attention with Lookahead Keys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07301)
*Zhuoqing Song,Peng Sun,Huizhuo Yuan,Quanquan Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CASTLE是一种新型的因果注意力机制，通过动态更新每个token的lookahead keys来整合后续上下文信息，同时保持自回归特性，在语言建模任务中表现优于标准因果注意力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准因果注意力中每个token的QKV是静态的，只能编码前文信息，限制了模型对完整上下文的理解能力

Method: 提出CASTLE机制，持续更新每个token的keys（称为lookahead keys），让早期位置的token能够整合后续位置的信息，同时保持自回归特性，并通过数学等价性实现并行训练

Result: 在语言建模基准测试中，CASTLE在不同规模的模型上都优于标准因果注意力，降低了验证困惑度，并在多个下游任务上表现更好

Conclusion: CASTLE通过动态更新lookahead keys有效提升了因果注意力的性能，为自回归模型提供了更好的上下文理解能力

Abstract: In standard causal attention, each token's query, key, and value (QKV) are
static and encode only preceding context. We introduce CAuSal aTtention with
Lookahead kEys (CASTLE), an attention mechanism that continually updates each
token's keys as the context unfolds. We term these updated keys lookahead keys
because they belong to earlier positions yet integrate information from tokens
that appear later relative to those positions, while strictly preserving the
autoregressive property. Although the mechanism appears sequential, we derive a
mathematical equivalence that avoids explicitly materializing lookahead keys at
each position and enables efficient parallel training. On language modeling
benchmarks, CASTLE consistently outperforms standard causal attention across
model scales, reducing validation perplexity and improving performance on a
range of downstream tasks.

### [9] [Basis Vector Metric: A Method for Robust Open-Ended State Change Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07308)
*David Oprea,Sam Powers*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BVM方法在图像状态分类中表现最佳，但在形容词区分方面不如逻辑回归模型，但有改进潜力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试BVM方法在判断图像状态变化方面的能力，特别是在语言嵌入的背景下

Method: 使用MIT-States数据集（53,000张图像，225个名词和115个形容词），通过BVM方法与余弦相似度、点积、乘积量化、二进制索引、朴素贝叶斯和自定义神经网络进行比较

Result: BVM在名词状态分类方面表现最佳，但在形容词区分方面未能超越逻辑回归模型

Conclusion: BVM方法在状态分类方面有效，但在形容词区分方面需要进一步改进，存在提升准确性的潜力

Abstract: We test a new method, which we will abbreviate using the acronym BVM (Basis
Vectors Method), in its ability to judge the state changes in images through
using language embeddings. We used the MIT-States dataset, containing about
53,000 images, to gather all of our data, which has 225 nouns and 115
adjectives, with each noun having about 9 different adjectives, forming
approximately 1000 noun-adjective pairs. For our first experiment, we test our
method's ability to determine the state of each noun class separately against
other metrics for comparison. These metrics are cosine similarity, dot product,
product quantization, binary index, Naive Bayes, and a custom neural network.
Among these metrics, we found that our proposed BVM performs the best in
classifying the states for each noun. We then perform a second experiment where
we try using BVM to determine if it can differentiate adjectives from one
another for each adjective separately. We compared the abilities of BVM to
differentiate adjectives against the proposed method the MIT-States paper
suggests: using a logistic regression model. In the end, we did not find
conclusive evidence that our BVM metric could perform better than the logistic
regression model at discerning adjectives. Yet, we were able to find evidence
for possible improvements to our method; this leads to the chance of increasing
our method's accuracy through certain changes in our methodologies.

### [10] [Instance-level Performance Prediction for Long-form Generation Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07309)
*Chi-Yang Hsu,Alexander Braylan,Yiheng Su,Omar Alonso,Matthew Lease*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个新的基准测试，用于长文本生成任务的实例级性能预测，能够预测连续评估指标分数和不确定性区间，在11个数据集上验证了仅需16个训练样本即可有效预测分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为长文本生成任务建立实例级性能预测基准，解决多维度、细粒度质量指标的预测问题，支持黑盒模型的输入输出分析。

Method: 采用任务、模型和指标无关的公式化方法，仅基于黑盒模型的输入输出来预测连续评估指标分数，并推断预测区间来量化不确定性。

Result: 在11个长文本数据集上验证，使用多个LLM、基准线和任务指标，证明仅需16个训练样本就能有效预测分数。

Conclusion: 引入了一个新颖且实用的任务，提供了有价值的基准来推动进展，并提供了可直接实际应用的基线方法。

Abstract: We motivate and share a new benchmark for instance-level performance
prediction of long-form generation tasks having multi-faceted, fine-grained
quality metrics. Our task-, model- and metric-agnostic formulation predicts
continuous evaluation metric scores given only black-box model inputs and
outputs. Beyond predicting point estimates of metric scores, the benchmark also
requires inferring prediction intervals to quantify uncertainty around point
estimates. Evaluation spans 11 long-form datasets/tasks with multiple LLMs,
baselines, and metrics per task. We show that scores can be effectively
predicted across long-form generation tasks using as few as 16 training
examples. Overall, we introduce a novel and useful task, a valuable benchmark
to drive progress, and baselines ready for practical adoption today.

### [11] [Does This Look Familiar to You? Knowledge Analysis via Model Internal Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07311)
*Sihyun Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KAMIR提出一种基于模型内部表征的数据选择方法，通过计算隐藏层状态与最终状态的相似度来评估模型对输入的熟悉程度，从而选择更有效的训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决目前监督微调整(SFT)中缺乏有效数据选择方母的问题。现有知识基于选择方法依赖prompt工程，效果不稳定且成本高。

Method: KAMIR方法分析模型各层隐藏状态与最终隐藏状态的相似度，用于评估模型对输入数据的熟悉程度，选择模型不熟悉的数据进行训练。

Result: 在多种任务数据集上的实验表明，使用模型不熟悉的数据进行训练能够提升模型的泛化性能。

Conclusion: KAMIR提供了一种不依赖prompt工程的高效数据选择方法，能够应用于更广泛的任务类型，通过选择模型不熟悉的数据来提升训练效果。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have been driven by
pretraining, supervised fine tuning (SFT), and alignment tuning. Among these,
SFT plays a crucial role in transforming a model 's general knowledge into
structured responses tailored to specific tasks. However, there is no clearly
established methodology for effective training data selection. Simply
increasing the volume of data does not guarantee performance improvements,
while preprocessing, sampling, and validation require substantial time and
cost.
  To address this issue, a variety of data selection methods have been
proposed. Among them, knowledge based selection approaches identify suitable
training data by analyzing the model 's responses. Nevertheless, these methods
typically rely on prompt engineering, making them sensitive to variations and
incurring additional costs for prompt design.
  In this study, we propose Knowledge Analysis via Model Internal
Representations (KAMIR), a novel approach that overcomes these limitations by
analyzing data based on the model 's internal representations. KAMIR computes
similarities between the hidden states of each layer (block) and the final
hidden states for a given input to assess the data. Unlike prior methods that
were largely limited to multiple choice tasks, KAMIR can be applied to a wide
range of tasks such as machine reading comprehension and summarization.
Moreover, it selects data useful for training based on the model 's familiarity
with the input, even with a small dataset and a simple classifier architecture.
Experiments across diverse task datasets demonstrate that training with less
familiar data leads to better generalization performance.

*Nakyung Lee,Yeongoon Kim,Minhae Oh,Suhwan Kim,Jin Woo Koo,Hyewon Jo,Jungwoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了SAOBP框架，通过信念传播注入多跳关系来解决自注意力机制中的局部化问题，引入GTD指标量化多跳连接贡献，在小型模型中取得竞争性提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer自注意力机制存在局部化问题，注意力集中在有限token子集上，难以捕获长距离依赖关系

Method: 提出Self-Attention One-step Belief Propagation (SAOBP)框架，通过信念传播过程注入多跳关系，并引入Global Token Dependency (GTD)指标来量化和解释这些交互

Result: SAOBP有助于防止深层网络中的熵崩溃，自适应地将GTD维持在任务适当水平，从而提升模型性能，特别是在小型模型中观察到竞争性增益

Conclusion: SAOBP框架有效解决了自注意力局部化问题，在资源受限场景下具有改善推理质量的潜力

Abstract: Transformer-based self-attention mechanism serves as the core of modern
language models, yet it often suffers from localization, where attentions
collapse onto a limited subset of tokens and fail to capture long-range
dependencies. To address this issue, we propose Self-Attention One-step Belief
Propagation (SAOBP), a refinement framework that injects multi-hop
relationships through a belief propagation process. To interpret and quantify
these interactions, we introduce Global Token Dependency (GTD) that captures
the relative contribution of multihop connections within the attention graph.
Empirical results indicate that SAOBP helps prevent entropy collapse in deeper
layers and adaptively maintains GTD at task-appropriate levels, thereby
supporting improvements in model performance. Importantly, we observe
competitive gains in small-scale models, highlighting its potential for
improving inference quality in resource-constrained scenarios.

### [13] [PersonaFuse: A Personality Activation-Driven Framework for Enhancing Human-LLM Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07370)
*Yixuan Tang,Yi Yang,Ahmed Abbasi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PersonaFuse是一个基于特质激活理论和Big Five人格模型的LLM后训练框架，通过混合专家架构使模型能够根据不同情境表达不同个性，显著提升社交情感智能而不损害通用推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在现实对话中表现出情感感知和社交能力的局限性，无法根据不同社交和任务情境调整沟通风格和情感表达，需要开发能够适应不同人格特征的AI系统。

Method: 基于特质激活理论和Big Five人格模型，采用混合专家架构，结合人格适配器和动态路由网络，实现情境化特质表达的后训练框架。

Result: 在多个社交情感智能维度上显著优于基线模型，在下游应用如心理健康咨询和客户服务中表现一致提升，人类偏好评估显示与大型模型竞争性表现。

Conclusion: PersonaFuse提供了一个理论基础扎实且实用的方法来开发社交情感增强的LLM，标志着向更人性化AI系统的重要进展。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities across various fields. These developments have led to more direct
communication between humans and LLMs in various situations, such as social
companionship and psychological support. However, LLMs often exhibit
limitations in emotional perception and social competence during real-world
conversations. These limitations partly originate from their inability to adapt
their communication style and emotional expression to different social and task
contexts. In this work, we introduce PersonaFuse, a novel LLM post-training
framework that enables LLMs to adapt and express different personalities for
varying situations. Inspired by Trait Activation Theory and the Big Five
personality model, PersonaFuse employs a Mixture-of-Expert architecture that
combines persona adapters with a dynamic routing network, enabling contextual
trait expression. Experimental results show that PersonaFuse substantially
outperforms baseline models across multiple dimensions of social-emotional
intelligence. Importantly, these gains are achieved without sacrificing general
reasoning ability or model safety, which remain common limitations of direct
prompting and supervised fine-tuning approaches. PersonaFuse also delivers
consistent improvements in downstream human-centered applications, such as
mental health counseling and review-based customer service. Finally, human
preference evaluations against leading LLMs, including GPT-4o and DeepSeek,
demonstrate that PersonaFuse achieves competitive response quality despite its
comparatively smaller model size. These findings demonstrate that
PersonaFuse~offers a theoretically grounded and practical approach for
developing social-emotional enhanced LLMs, marking a significant advancement
toward more human-centric AI systems.

*Sankalp Tattwadarshi Swain,Anshika Krishnatray,Dhruv Kumar,Jagat Sesh Challa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大语言模型在通过模式识别和交互反馈学习新语言方面的语言获得能力评估，发现模型无法在100次回应内建立对话，但采用了类似人类的语言学习策略


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注语言模型的词汇学习、语法推理等能力，但缺乏对通过模式识别和交互反馈学习语言的评估，而这正是人类语言获得的核心特征

Method: 提出了一种新的实验框架，让语言模型以一种新构建的语言(Tinkatongue)与只理解该语言的机器人进行对话，评估其语言获得能力

Result: 语言模型在100次回应内无法成功建立对话，但显示出了与人类类似的语言学习策略和近似人类的学习行为

Conclusion: 这些结果为语言模型评测标准提供了新方向，并为设计能够更有效从交互反馈中学习的模型开启了新途径

Abstract: Existing evaluation studies on linguistic competence of large language models
(LLM agents) have focused primarily on vocabulary learning, morphological rule
induction, syntactic generalization, pragmatic inference, and cross-linguistic
transfer. However, none assess whether LLM agents can acquire a language
through pattern recognition and interactive feedback, a central feature of
human language acquisition. We propose a novel experimental framework in which
an LLM agent is evaluated on its ability to acquire and use a newly constructed
language (Tinkatongue) in conversation with a bot that understands only
Tinkatongue. Our findings show that LLM agents fail to establish a conversation
within 100 responses, yet they adopt distinct strategies that mirror human
approaches to language learning. The results suggest a new direction for
evaluation benchmarks and open pathways to model designs that learn more
effectively from interactive feedback.

TL;DR: 通过为小型语言模型添加轻量知识图遍历模块，提升了在知识固问答任务中的表现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖专有或极大模型，限制了可访问性和可扩展性，而小型模型在知识图遍历和推理方面能力有限

Method: 提出利用简单高效的探索模块来处理知识图遍历，代替语言模型本身进行遍历

Result: 实验结果表明这些轻量模块有效提升了小型语言模型在知识图问答任务上的性能

Conclusion: 通过轻量模块补充小型模型的知识图遍历能力，可以在保持可访问性的同时提高性能，为减少幻觉提供了一种可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) into the reasoning processes of large
language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate
hallucination. However, existing work in this area often relies on proprietary
or extremely large models, limiting accessibility and scalability. In this
study, we investigate the capabilities of existing integration methods for
small language models (SLMs) in KG-based question answering and observe that
their performance is often constrained by their limited ability to traverse and
reason over knowledge graphs. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging
simple and efficient exploration modules to handle knowledge graph traversal in
place of the language model itself. Experiment results demonstrate that these
lightweight modules effectively improve the performance of small language
models on knowledge graph question answering tasks. Source code:

TL;DR: LongEmotion是一个专门为长上下文情感智能任务设计的基准测试，涵盖6类情感任务，平均输入长度8777个token。提出了RAG和CoEM两种方法来提升LLM在长上下文中的情感智能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试忽视了长上下文场景下的情感智能评估，特别是在真实、实用的设置中，交互通常是冗长、多样且嘈杂的。需要向更现实的环境推进。

Method: 构建LongEmotion基准测试，包含情感分类、检测、问答、对话、摘要和表达6类任务。提出两种方法：1）RAG方法利用对话上下文和LLM本身作为检索源；2）CoEM方法将任务分解为5个阶段，整合检索增强和有限知识注入。

Result: 实验结果表明，RAG和CoEM方法在大多数长上下文任务中都能持续提升情感智能相关性能。对GPT系列模型的比较案例研究显示了不同模型在情感智能方面的差异。

Conclusion: 该研究推动了LLM向更实用和真实世界的情感智能应用发展，提出的基准测试和方法为长上下文情感智能评估提供了重要工具和解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make significant progress in Emotional
Intelligence (EI) and long-context understanding. However, existing benchmarks
tend to overlook certain aspects of EI in long-context scenarios, especially
under realistic, practical settings where interactions are lengthy, diverse,
and often noisy. To move towards such realistic settings, we present
LongEmotion, a benchmark specifically designed for long-context EI tasks. It
covers a diverse set of tasks, including Emotion Classification, Emotion
Detection, Emotion QA, Emotion Conversation, Emotion Summary, and Emotion
Expression. On average, the input length for these tasks reaches 8,777 tokens,
with long-form generation required for Emotion Expression. To enhance
performance under realistic constraints, we incorporate Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) and Collaborative Emotional Modeling (CoEM), and compare them
with standard prompt-based methods. Unlike conventional approaches, our RAG
method leverages both the conversation context and the large language model
itself as retrieval sources, avoiding reliance on external knowledge bases. The
CoEM method further improves performance by decomposing the task into five
stages, integrating both retrieval augmentation and limited knowledge
injection. Experimental results show that both RAG and CoEM consistently
enhance EI-related performance across most long-context tasks, advancing LLMs
toward more practical and real-world EI applications. Furthermore, we conducted
a comparative case study experiment on the GPT series to demonstrate the
differences among various models in terms of EI. Code is available on GitHub at

Motivation: 社交媒体中积极支持性语言（糖果语音）能够促进文明交流，但自动化检测技术尚未充分探索，限制了对其影响的系统分析。

Method: 使用GBERT、Qwen3 Embedding和XLM-RoBERTa等单语和多语言模型，在46k条德语YouTube评论语料库中进行糖果语音检测，采用span级训练方法。

Result: 多语言XLM-RoBERTa-Large模型在GermEval 2025糖果语音检测任务中排名第一，二元阳性F1达0.8906，分类span检测严格F1达0.6307。

Abstract: Positive, supportive online communication in social media (candy speech) has
the potential to foster civility, yet automated detection of such language
remains underexplored, limiting systematic analysis of its impact. We
investigate how candy speech can be reliably detected in a 46k-comment German
YouTube corpus by monolingual and multilingual language models, including
GBERT, Qwen3 Embedding, and XLM-RoBERTa. We find that a multilingual
XLM-RoBERTa-Large model trained to detect candy speech at the span level
outperforms other approaches, ranking first in both binary positive F1: 0.8906)
and categorized span-based detection (strict F1: 0.6307) subtasks at the
GermEval 2025 Shared Task on Candy Speech Detection. We speculate that
span-based training, multilingual capabilities, and emoji-aware tokenizers
improved detection performance. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of
multilingual models in identifying positive, supportive language.

Motivation: 医疗环境中污名化语言导致健康不平等，但目前缺乏普遍接受的标准词典来定义哪些词语构成医疗领域的污名化语言。

Method: 进行系统文献检索识别现有污名化语言词典，然后进行对比分析：1）词典间的相似性和差异；2）基于既定情感数据集的正面、负面或中性术语分布。

Result: 识别出四个词典，分析显示它们具有中等语义相似性，大多数污名化术语涉及临床医生描述感知负面行为的评判性表达。情感分析显示主要为负面分类术语，但各词典间存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了标准化词典的必要性，并突显了在临床文本中定义污名化语言所面临的挑战。

Abstract: Stigmatizing language results in healthcare inequities, yet there is no
universally accepted or standardized lexicon defining which words, terms, or
phrases constitute stigmatizing language in healthcare. We conducted a
systematic search of the literature to identify existing stigmatizing language
lexicons and then analyzed them comparatively to examine: 1) similarities and
discrepancies between these lexicons, and 2) the distribution of positive,
negative, or neutral terms based on an established sentiment dataset. Our
search identified four lexicons. The analysis results revealed moderate
semantic similarity among them, and that most stigmatizing terms are related to
judgmental expressions by clinicians to describe perceived negative behaviors.
Sentiment analysis showed a predominant proportion of negatively classified
terms, though variations exist across lexicons. Our findings underscore the
need for a standardized lexicon and highlight challenges in defining
stigmatizing language in clinical texts.

machine translation performance, with a minimum increase of 25\% in BLEU score
across all six languages.We provide a comprehensive analysis and highlight the
potential of these techniques to improve machine translation systems for
low-resource languages, contributing to the development of more robust
translation systems for under-resourced languages.

Abstract: Detecting content that contradicts or is unsupported by a given source text
is a critical challenge for the safe deployment of generative language models.
We introduce HALT-RAG, a post-hoc verification system designed to identify
hallucinations in the outputs of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines. Our flexible and task-adaptable framework uses a universal feature
set derived from an ensemble of two frozen, off-the-shelf Natural Language
Inference (NLI) models and lightweight lexical signals. These features are used
to train a simple, calibrated, and task-adapted meta-classifier. Using a
rigorous 5-fold out-of-fold (OOF) training protocol to prevent data leakage and
produce unbiased estimates, we evaluate our system on the HaluEval benchmark.
By pairing our universal feature set with a lightweight, task-adapted
classifier and a precision-constrained decision policy, HALT-RAG achieves
strong OOF F1-scores of 0.7756, 0.9786, and 0.7391 on the summarization, QA,
and dialogue tasks, respectively. The system's well-calibrated probabilities
enable a practical abstention mechanism, providing a reliable tool for
balancing model performance with safety requirements.

Motivation: 解决科学领域实体识别任务中LLM微调成本高昂的问题，寻求性能与成本的最佳平衡。

Method: 提出三阶段主动学习框架，依次采用三种不同的主动学习策略来选择最具信息量和代表性的样本，构建真实检索语料库用于LLM的上下文学习。

Result: 在三个专业领域数据集上，ALLabel在相同标注预算下始终优于所有基线方法，仅标注5%-10%的数据就能达到全数据集标注的相当性能。

Conclusion: ALLabel框架有效且具有通用性，能够显著降低标注成本同时保持高性能，为科学领域实体识别任务提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Many contemporary data-driven research efforts in the natural sciences, such
as chemistry and materials science, require large-scale, high-performance
entity recognition from scientific datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have
increasingly been adopted to solve the entity recognition task, with the same
trend being observed on all-spectrum NLP tasks. The prevailing entity
recognition LLMs rely on fine-tuned technology, yet the fine-tuning process
often incurs significant cost. To achieve a best performance-cost trade-off, we
propose ALLabel, a three-stage framework designed to select the most
informative and representative samples in preparing the demonstrations for LLM
modeling. The annotated examples are used to construct a ground-truth retrieval
corpus for LLM in-context learning. By sequentially employing three distinct
active learning strategies, ALLabel consistently outperforms all baselines
under the same annotation budget across three specialized domain datasets.
Experimental results also demonstrate that selectively annotating only 5\%-10\%
of the dataset with ALLabel can achieve performance comparable to the method
annotating the entire dataset. Further analyses and ablation studies verify the
effectiveness and generalizability of our proposal.

Method: 采用两阶段学习范式，构建查询驱动的人-代理-GUI交互框架，在正常条件下自主执行动作，在不可信场景下主动查询人类。

Result: 在不可信场景下比最先进方法平均步骤成功率提高20.64%，且不影响正常性能表现。

Conclusion: VeriOS-Agent展现出良好的合理性、泛化性和可扩展性，为可信赖操作系统代理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of multimodal large language models, operating system
(OS) agents become increasingly capable of automating tasks through on-device
graphical user interfaces (GUIs). However, most existing OS agents are designed
for idealized settings, whereas real-world environments often present
untrustworthy conditions. To mitigate risks of over-execution in such
scenarios, we propose a query-driven human-agent-GUI interaction framework that
enables OS agents to decide when to query humans for more reliable task
completion. Built upon this framework, we introduce VeriOS-Agent, a trustworthy
OS agent trained with a two-stage learning paradigm that falicitate the
decoupling and utilization of meta-knowledge. Concretely, VeriOS-Agent
autonomously executes actions in normal conditions while proactively querying
humans in untrustworthy scenarios. Experiments show that VeriOS-Agent improves
the average step-wise success rate by 20.64\% in untrustworthy scenarios over
the state-of-the-art, without compromising normal performance. Analysis
highlights VeriOS-Agent's rationality, generalizability, and scalability. The

Method: IRAKE方法，通过单编辑事实和完整编辑案例的引导进行迭代检索增强知识编辑，采用引导分解策略

Result: 实验结果表明IRAKE有效缓解了编辑跳过导致的编辑失败，在多跳问答知识编辑任务上优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: IRAKE方法通过迭代检索和引导分解有效解决了多跳问答中的知识编辑挑战，为参数无关的知识编辑提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: In a rapidly evolving world where information updates swiftly, knowledge in
large language models (LLMs) becomes outdated quickly. Retraining LLMs is not a
cost-effective option, making knowledge editing (KE) without modifying
parameters particularly necessary. We find that although existing
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based KE methods excel at editing simple
knowledge, they struggle with KE in multi-hop question answering due to the
issue of "edit skipping", which refers to skipping the relevant edited fact in
inference. In addition to the diversity of natural language expressions of
knowledge, edit skipping also arises from the mismatch between the granularity
of LLMs in problem-solving and the facts in the edited memory. To address this
issue, we propose a novel Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge Editing
method with guided decomposition (IRAKE) through the guidance from single
edited facts and entire edited cases. Experimental results demonstrate that
IRAKE mitigates the failure of editing caused by edit skipping and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods for KE in multi-hop question answering.

Method: 提出BALI方法：1）将文本中的生物医学概念链接到UMLS知识图谱；2）使用局部KG子图作为跨模态正样本；3）联合训练LM和KG编码器并对其表示。

Result: 在PubMedBERT和BioLinkBERT等主流生物医学LM上应用该方法，即使在小规模PubMed摘要数据集上进行最小预训练，也能显著提升语言理解任务性能和实体表示质量。

Conclusion: BALI方法有效解决了生物医学LLM与知识图谱的对齐问题，通过跨模态学习显著增强了模型对生物医学领域知识的理解和表示能力。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been substantial progress in using pretrained
Language Models (LMs) on a range of tasks aimed at improving the understanding
of biomedical texts. Nonetheless, existing biomedical LLMs show limited
comprehension of complex, domain-specific concept structures and the factual
information encoded in biomedical Knowledge Graphs (KGs). In this work, we
propose BALI (Biomedical Knowledge Graph and Language Model Alignment), a novel
joint LM and KG pre-training method that augments an LM with external knowledge
by the simultaneous learning of a dedicated KG encoder and aligning the
representations of both the LM and the graph. For a given textual sequence, we
link biomedical concept mentions to the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)
KG and utilize local KG subgraphs as cross-modal positive samples for these
mentions. Our empirical findings indicate that implementing our method on
several leading biomedical LMs, such as PubMedBERT and BioLinkBERT, improves
their performance on a range of language understanding tasks and the quality of
entity representations, even with minimal pre-training on a small alignment
dataset sourced from PubMed scientific abstracts.

Motivation: 临床报告通常长缠且充满专业术语，导致医生和患者沟通困难，需要有效的摘要技术来支持共同决策。

Method: 使用迭代自我提示技术（ISP）在LLMs上，通过生成任务特定提示并使用示例进行少样本学习精炼，同时使用ROUGE和BERT-score指标指导模型微调。

Result: 在3,396份多专业临床案例报告上，使用GPT-4和GPT-4o的视角感知ISP方法获得了ROUGE分数(46.53, 24.68, 30.77)和BERTscore(87.84, 83.25, 85.46)，表明模型生成了语义等价但词汇重叠较低的摘要。

Conclusion: 视角感知ISP技术可以有效应用于临床报告摘要，支持更好的医情沟通。

Abstract: Efficient communication between patients and clinicians plays an important
role in shared decision-making. However, clinical reports are often lengthy and
filled with clinical jargon, making it difficult for domain experts to identify
important aspects in the document efficiently. This paper presents the
methodology we applied in the MultiClinSUM shared task for summarising clinical
case documents. We used an Iterative Self-Prompting technique on large language
models (LLMs) by asking LLMs to generate task-specific prompts and refine them
via example-based few-shot learning. Furthermore, we used lexical and embedding
space metrics, ROUGE and BERT-score, to guide the model fine-tuning with
epochs. Our submission using perspective-aware ISP on GPT-4 and GPT-4o achieved
ROUGE scores (46.53, 24.68, 30.77) and BERTscores (87.84, 83.25, 85.46) for (P,
R, F1) from the official evaluation on 3,396 clinical case reports from various
specialties extracted from open journals. The high BERTscore indicates that the
model produced semantically equivalent output summaries compared to the
references, even though the overlap at the exact lexicon level is lower, as
reflected in the lower ROUGE scores. This work sheds some light on how
perspective-aware ISP (PA-ISP) can be deployed for clinical report
summarisation and support better communication between patients and clinicians.

Motivation: 传统方法将文档转换为文本处理会丢失多模态信息（如图表），而大型视觉语言模型输入尺寸受限无法处理多页文档。现有的检索增强生成方法仅依赖语义相关性，忽略了页面间的逻辑连接。

Method: 构建页面图捕获页面间上下文关系，使用轻量级VLM进行图遍历检索相关页面，结合语义和逻辑相关性。提供两种变体：无需训练的解决方案和微调版本。

Result: 在四个DocQA数据集上实验显示，相比LVLM直接推理平均准确率提升9.68%，相比基线检索精度提升7.44%。

Conclusion: MoLoRAG通过逻辑感知检索有效解决了多模态多页文档理解中的逻辑连接忽略问题，显著提升了文档问答性能。

Abstract: Document Understanding is a foundational AI capability with broad
applications, and Document Question Answering (DocQA) is a key evaluation task.
Traditional methods convert the document into text for processing by Large
Language Models (LLMs), but this process strips away critical multi-modal
information like figures. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) address
this limitation, their constrained input size makes multi-page document
comprehension infeasible. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods mitigate
this by selecting relevant pages, but they rely solely on semantic relevance,
ignoring logical connections between pages and the query, which is essential
for reasoning.
  To this end, we propose MoLoRAG, a logic-aware retrieval framework for
multi-modal, multi-page document understanding. By constructing a page graph
that captures contextual relationships between pages, a lightweight VLM
performs graph traversal to retrieve relevant pages, including those with
logical connections often overlooked. This approach combines semantic and
logical relevance to deliver more accurate retrieval. After retrieval, the
top-$K$ pages are fed into arbitrary LVLMs for question answering. To enhance
flexibility, MoLoRAG offers two variants: a training-free solution for easy
deployment and a fine-tuned version to improve logical relevance checking.
Experiments on four DocQA datasets demonstrate average improvements of 9.68% in
accuracy over LVLM direct inference and 7.44% in retrieval precision over
baselines. Codes and datasets are released at

Motivation: 关系提取训练数据手动标注成本高，需要从无标签文本中自动提取高质量训练样本，但现有LLM方法在多分类分类时语义损失，二元分类时计算费用太高

Method: 提出M-BRe框架，包含三个模块：关系分组模块、关系提取模块和标签决策模块，结合多分类和二元分类方法的优势

Result: 经过大量实验验证，M-BRe能够从无标签文本中发现高质量的训练样本，为关系提取任务提供有效支持

Conclusion: M-BRe框架有效解决了使用LLM进行关系提取时的两大挑战，在保持语义理解能力的同时控制计算复杂度，为无监督关系提取提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: For Relation Extraction (RE), the manual annotation of training data may be
prohibitively expensive, since the sentences that contain the target relations
in texts can be very scarce and difficult to find. It is therefore beneficial
to develop an efficient method that can automatically extract training
instances from unlabeled texts for training RE models. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) have been adopted in various natural language processing tasks,
with RE also benefiting from their advances. However, when leveraging LLMs for
RE with predefined relation categories, two key challenges arise. First, in a
multi-class classification setting, LLMs often struggle to comprehensively
capture the semantics of every relation, leading to suboptimal results. Second,
although employing binary classification for each relation individually can
mitigate this issue, it introduces significant computational overhead,
resulting in impractical time complexity for real-world applications.
Therefore, this paper proposes a framework called M-BRe to extract training
instances from unlabeled texts for RE. It utilizes three modules to combine the
advantages of both of the above classification approaches: Relation Grouping,
Relation Extraction, and Label Decision. Extensive experiments confirm its
superior capability in discovering high-quality training samples from unlabeled
texts for RE.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在医疗等敏感领域的应用，水印技术的可靠性成为关键问题。现有评测标准过于关注检测质量的权衡，而忽视了低熵异环境下的事实性风险。

Method: 提出专门针对医疗领域的评估流程，结合评估事实准确性和语义连贯性。使用GPT-Judger进行判断，并通过人工验证，提出事实性加权分数（FWS）综合指标。

Result: 当前水印方法在医疗领域对事实性造成显著抑制，熵异偏移导致医学实体表达力下降。

Conclusion: 医疗领域需要域感知的水印方法，以确保医疗内容的完整性和准确性，避免因水印技术引入的事实性风险。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) adapted to sensitive domains such as
medicine, their fluency raises safety risks, particularly regarding provenance
and accountability. Watermarking embeds detectable patterns to mitigate these
risks, yet its reliability in medical contexts remains untested. Existing
benchmarks focus on detection-quality tradeoffs, overlooking factual risks
under low-entropy settings often exploited by watermarking's reweighting
strategy. We propose a medical-focused evaluation workflow that jointly
assesses factual accuracy and coherence. Using GPT-Judger and further human
validation, we introduce the Factuality-Weighted Score (FWS), a composite
metric prioritizing factual accuracy beyond coherence to guide watermarking
deployment in medical domains. Our evaluation shows current watermarking
methods substantially compromise medical factuality, with entropy shifts
degrading medical entity representation. These findings underscore the need for
domain-aware watermarking approaches that preserve the integrity of medical
content.

Motivation: 在线平台上虚假新闻、极化内容和有害信息的传播已成为严重问题，但缺乏对不同LLM模型、使用方法和语言在这些任务上的系统性性能评估。

Method: 使用10个数据集和5种语言（英语、西班牙语、葡萄牙语、阿拉伯语和保加利亚语），测试了参数高效微调和多种上下文学习策略（零样本提示、代码本、少样本学习、DPP多样性选择和思维链）。

Result: 研究发现上下文学习通常表现不如微调模型，即使是较小的微调模型也能胜过大型模型的上下文学习设置（包括LlaMA3.1-8b-Instruct、Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407和Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct）。

Conclusion: 微调在任务特定设置中比上下文学习更有效，即使是较小的微调模型也能超越大型模型的上下文学习性能，强调了微调的重要性。

Abstract: The spread of fake news, polarizing, politically biased, and harmful content
on online platforms has been a serious concern. With large language models
becoming a promising approach, however, no study has properly benchmarked their
performance across different models, usage methods, and languages. This study
presents a comprehensive overview of different Large Language Models adaptation
paradigms for the detection of hyperpartisan and fake news, harmful tweets, and
political bias. Our experiments spanned 10 datasets and 5 different languages
(English, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic and Bulgarian), covering both binary and
multiclass classification scenarios. We tested different strategies ranging
from parameter efficient Fine-Tuning of language models to a variety of
different In-Context Learning strategies and prompts. These included zero-shot
prompts, codebooks, few-shot (with both randomly-selected and
diversely-selected examples using Determinantal Point Processes), and
Chain-of-Thought. We discovered that In-Context Learning often underperforms
when compared to Fine-Tuning a model. This main finding highlights the
importance of Fine-Tuning even smaller models on task-specific settings even
when compared to the largest models evaluated in an In-Context Learning setup -
in our case LlaMA3.1-8b-Instruct, Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407 and
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct.

TL;DR: SciNLP是首个专门针对NLP领域的全文本实体关系抽取基准数据集，包含60篇人工标注的完整论文，涵盖7072个实体和1826个关系，用于支持知识图谱构建和下游应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: SciNLP填补了NLP领域全文本实体关系抽取数据集的空白，为相关研究提供了重要基准，支持高质量知识图谱构建并增强下游应用效果。

Abstract: Structured information extraction from scientific literature is crucial for
capturing core concepts and emerging trends in specialized fields. While
existing datasets aid model development, most focus on specific publication
sections due to domain complexity and the high cost of annotating scientific
texts. To address this limitation, we introduce SciNLP - a specialized
benchmark for full-text entity and relation extraction in the Natural Language
Processing (NLP) domain. The dataset comprises 60 manually annotated full-text
NLP publications, covering 7,072 entities and 1,826 relations. Compared to
existing research, SciNLP is the first dataset providing full-text annotations
of entities and their relationships in the NLP domain. To validate the
effectiveness of SciNLP, we conducted comparative experiments with similar
datasets and evaluated the performance of state-of-the-art supervised models on
this dataset. Results reveal varying extraction capabilities of existing models
across academic texts of different lengths. Cross-comparisons with existing
datasets show that SciNLP achieves significant performance improvements on
certain baseline models. Using models trained on SciNLP, we implemented
automatic construction of a fine-grained knowledge graph for the NLP domain.
Our KG has an average node degree of 3.2 per entity, indicating rich semantic
topological information that enhances downstream applications. The dataset is
publicly available at https://github.com/AKADDC/SciNLP.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了DK2R方法，通过利用双重知识（结构化属性和非结构化评论）和两阶段推理机制，促进多模态任务导向对话系统的文本响应生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态对话系统忽视了非结构化评论知识，并且没有充分利用大语言模型（LLMs）的潜力。需要充分利用双重知识来提升文本响应生成的质量。

Method: 提出DK2R方法：1）从外部知识库提取结构化属性和非结构化评论知识；2）使用LLM分析每种知识类型的有用性（通过生成插件响应）；3）分离总结意图导向的关键线索，作为辅助信号增强LLM的文本生成能力。

Result: 在公开数据集上进行的广泛实验验证了DK2R的优勒性，表明方法能够有效提升多模态对话系统的文本响应生成质量。

Conclusion: DK2R通过创新地结合双重知识和两阶段推理机制，成功解决了动态知识类型选择和意图-响应解耦的挑战，为多模态对话系统提供了更有效的文本生成方案。

Abstract: Textual response generation is pivotal for multimodal \mbox{task-oriented}
dialog systems, which aims to generate proper textual responses based on the
multimodal context. While existing efforts have demonstrated remarkable
progress, there still exist the following limitations: 1) \textit{neglect of
unstructured review knowledge} and 2) \textit{underutilization of large
language models (LLMs)}. Inspired by this, we aim to fully utilize dual
knowledge (\textit{i.e., } structured attribute and unstructured review
knowledge) with LLMs to promote textual response generation in multimodal
task-oriented dialog systems. However, this task is non-trivial due to two key
challenges: 1) \textit{dynamic knowledge type selection} and 2)
\textit{intention-response decoupling}. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel dual knowledge-enhanced two-stage reasoner by adapting LLMs for
multimodal dialog systems (named DK2R). To be specific, DK2R first extracts
both structured attribute and unstructured review knowledge from external
knowledge base given the dialog context. Thereafter, DK2R uses an LLM to
evaluate each knowledge type's utility by analyzing LLM-generated provisional
probe responses. Moreover, DK2R separately summarizes the intention-oriented
key clues via dedicated reasoning, which are further used as auxiliary signals
to enhance LLM-based textual response generation. Extensive experiments
conducted on a public dataset verify the superiority of DK2R. We have released
the codes and parameters.

*Mihai Nadas,Laura Diosan,Andreea Tomescu,Andrei Piscoran*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TF2是一个用于英罗文学翻译的统一框架，包含数据集创建、微调和评估，发布了12B参数的微调模型和300万/1.5万条合成平行数据集，在保持竞争力的同时更经济高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小规模开源模型在文学翻译这一复杂任务中的性能问题，为低资源语言（如罗马尼亚语）提供高质量文学数据集和可复现的翻译流程。

Method: 采用两阶段微调：先指令微调捕捉特定体裁叙事风格，再适配器压缩实现高效部署；使用高质量参考译文和合成数据集；结合BLEU和五维度LLM评估。

Result: 微调模型在流畅性和准确性方面与顶级专有大模型竞争，同时更加开放、易获取且成本效益显著更高。

Conclusion: TF2提供了端到端的可复现流程，支持成本效益翻译研究、跨语言叙事生成，以及在低资源环境中广泛采用开源模型处理文化重要文学内容。

Abstract: Literary translation has recently gained attention as a distinct and complex
task in machine translation research. However, the translation by small open
models remains an open problem. We contribute to this ongoing research by
introducing TINYFABULIST TRANSLATION FRAMEWORK (TF2), a unified framework for
dataset creation, fine tuning, and evaluation in English-Romanian literary
translations, centred on the creation and open release of both a compact, fine
tuned language model (TF2-12B) and large scale synthetic parallel datasets
(DS-TF2-EN-RO-3M and DS-TF2-EN-RO-15K). Building on DS-TF1-EN-3M (TF1), the
largest collection of synthetic English fables to date, we address the need for
rich, high quality literary datasets in low resource languages such as
Romanian. Our pipeline first generates 15k high quality Romanian references
from the TF1 pool using a high performing LLM. We then apply a two stage fine
tuning process to a 12B parameter open weight model: (i) instruction tuning to
capture genre specific narrative style, and (ii) adapter compression for
efficient deployment. Evaluation combines corpus level BLEU and a five
dimension LLM based rubric (accuracy, fluency, coherence, style, cultural
adaptation) to provide a nuanced assessment of translation quality. Results
show that our fine tuned model achieves fluency and adequacy competitive with
top performing large proprietary models, while being open, accessible, and
significantly more cost effective. Alongside the fine tuned model and both
datasets, we publicly release all scripts and evaluation prompts. TF2 thus
provides an end-to-end, reproducible pipeline for research on cost efficient
translation, cross lingual narrative generation, and the broad adoption of open
models for culturally significant literary content in low resource settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的输出不稳定，既有解码过程的非确定性，也有提示词的脆弱性。但提示词脆弱性是否是人类标注者共有的特性尚未被探索，本文旨在填补这一研究空白。

Method: 通过系统比较提示修改对LLMs和人类标注者的影响，使用文本分类任务，在相同指令修改条件下测试两者的敏感性。

Result: 研究发现人类和LLMs都对替代标签集或标签格式的修改表现出增加的脆弱性，但人类判断受拼写错误和标签顺序反转的影响较小。

Conclusion: 提示词脆弱性并非LLMs独有，人类标注者也存在类似敏感性，但程度和类型有所不同，这提示我们需要重新思考如何评估LLMs的提示词稳定性问题。

Abstract: The output of large language models (LLM) is unstable, due to both
non-determinism of the decoding process as well as to prompt brittleness. While
the intrinsic non-determinism of LLM generation may mimic existing uncertainty
in human annotations through distributional shifts in outputs, it is largely
assumed, yet unexplored, that the prompt brittleness effect is unique to LLMs.
This raises the question: do human annotators show similar sensitivity to
instruction changes? If so, should prompt brittleness in LLMs be considered
problematic? One may alternatively hypothesize that prompt brittleness
correctly reflects human annotation variances. To fill this research gap, we
systematically compare the effects of prompt modifications on LLMs and
identical instruction modifications for human annotators, focusing on the
question of whether humans are similarly sensitive to prompt perturbations. To
study this, we prompt both humans and LLMs for a set of text classification
tasks conditioned on prompt variations. Our findings indicate that both humans
and LLMs exhibit increased brittleness in response to specific types of prompt
modifications, particularly those involving the substitution of alternative
label sets or label formats. However, the distribution of human judgments is
less affected by typographical errors and reversed label order than that of
LLMs.

Result: 在偏见检测、分类和缓解方面表现出有效性，最终获得47.90%的平均得分，在共享任务中排名第四。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在中文性别偏见处理任务中取得了良好效果，证明了基于大语言模型微调结合多种策略的有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents our team's solution to Shared Task 7 of NLPCC-2025, which
focuses on sentence-level gender bias detection and mitigation in Chinese. The
task aims to promote fairness and controllability in natural language
generation by automatically detecting, classifying, and mitigating gender bias.
To address this challenge, we adopt a fine-tuning approach based on large
language models (LLMs), efficiently adapt to the bias detection task via
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). In terms of data processing, we construct a more
balanced training set to alleviate class imbalance and introduce heterogeneous
samples from multiple sources to enhance model generalization. For the
detection and classification sub-tasks, we employ a majority voting strategy
that integrates outputs from multiple expert models to boost performance.
Additionally, to improve bias generation detection and mitigation, we design a
multi-temperature sampling mechanism to capture potential variations in bias
expression styles. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in bias detection, classification, and mitigation. Our method
ultimately achieves an average score of 47.90%, ranking fourth in the shared
task.

Motivation: 随着家长越来越多使用大语言模型生成睡前故事，这些叙事中存在的文化和性别刻板印象问题值得关注，需要系统分析偏见如何影响主角属性和故事元素

Method: 创建Biased Tales综合数据集，分析不同性别和文化背景主角的LLM生成故事，比较主角属性和故事主题的差异

Result: 发现显著差异：女性主角外貌相关属性增加55.26%；非西方儿童故事 disproportionately 强调文化遗产、传统和家庭主题，远超西方儿童故事

Conclusion: 研究结果凸显了社会文化偏见在创意AI应用中的影响，强调需要使AI使用更加公平和多样化

Abstract: Stories play a pivotal role in human communication, shaping beliefs and
morals, particularly in children. As parents increasingly rely on large
language models (LLMs) to craft bedtime stories, the presence of cultural and
gender stereotypes in these narratives raises significant concerns. To address
this issue, we present Biased Tales, a comprehensive dataset designed to
analyze how biases influence protagonists' attributes and story elements in
LLM-generated stories. Our analysis uncovers striking disparities. When the
protagonist is described as a girl (as compared to a boy), appearance-related
attributes increase by 55.26%. Stories featuring non-Western children
disproportionately emphasize cultural heritage, tradition, and family themes
far more than those for Western children. Our findings highlight the role of
sociocultural bias in making creative AI use more equitable and diverse.

Motivation: 现有方法忽视语义依赖关系，仅依赖词级概率度量，无法捕捉生成文本中的结构关系，影响不确定性估计的可靠性

Method: 提出GENUINE框架，利用依赖解析树和分层图池化技术，结合监督学习来建模语义和结构关系

Result: 在多个NLP任务上的实验显示，GENUINE比基于语义熵的方法AUROC提升29%，校准误差降低超过15%

Conclusion: 基于图结构的不确定性建模方法有效提升了LLM不确定性估计的准确性和可靠性

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is essential for enhancing the reliability of Large
Language Models (LLMs), particularly in high-stakes applications. Existing
methods often overlook semantic dependencies, relying on token-level
probability measures that fail to capture structural relationships within the
generated text. We propose GENUINE: Graph ENhanced mUlti-level uncertaINty
Estimation for Large Language Models, a structure-aware framework that
leverages dependency parse trees and hierarchical graph pooling to refine
uncertainty quantification. By incorporating supervised learning, GENUINE
effectively models semantic and structural relationships, improving confidence
assessments. Extensive experiments across NLP tasks show that GENUINE achieves
up to 29% higher AUROC than semantic entropy-based approaches and reduces
calibration errors by over 15%, demonstrating the effectiveness of graph-based
uncertainty modeling. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖监督微调合成数据，鼓励教师强制模仿而非探索和泛化，难以有效训练并行思考能力

Method: 提出首个强化学习框架Parallel-R1，采用渐进式课程：先用SFT在简单任务上培养并行思考能力，然后转向RL在困难问题上探索和泛化该技能

Result: 在MATH、AMC23、AIME等数学基准上，相比直接在挑战性任务上用RL训练的序列思考模型，准确率提升8.4%；在AIME25上相比基线提升42.9%

Conclusion: 并行思考可作为中期训练探索支架，临时探索阶段能够解锁RL后的更高性能上限，模型表现出从探索策略到多视角验证的行为转变

Abstract: Parallel thinking has emerged as a novel approach for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by exploring multiple reasoning
paths concurrently. However, activating such capabilities through training
remains challenging, as existing methods predominantly rely on supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) over synthetic data, which encourages teacher-forced
imitation rather than exploration and generalization. Different from them, we
propose \textbf{Parallel-R1}, the first reinforcement learning (RL) framework
that enables parallel thinking behaviors for complex real-world reasoning
tasks. Our framework employs a progressive curriculum that explicitly addresses
the cold-start problem in training parallel thinking with RL. We first use SFT
on prompt-generated trajectories from easier tasks to instill the parallel
thinking ability, then transition to RL to explore and generalize this skill on
harder problems. Experiments on various math benchmarks, including MATH, AMC23,
and AIME, show that Parallel-R1 successfully instills parallel thinking,
leading to 8.4% accuracy improvements over the sequential thinking model
trained directly on challenging tasks with RL. Further analysis reveals a clear
shift in the model's thinking behavior: at an early stage, it uses parallel
thinking as an exploration strategy, while in a later stage, it uses the same
capability for multi-perspective verification. Most significantly, we validate
parallel thinking as a \textbf{mid-training exploration scaffold}, where this
temporary exploratory phase unlocks a higher performance ceiling after RL,
yielding a 42.9% improvement over the baseline on AIME25. Our model, data, and
code will be open-source at https://github.com/zhengkid/Parallel-R1.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模生物发现需要整合海量异构数据集，但技术批次效应和缺乏可泛化模型是主要障碍。

Method: 采用Transformer架构，设计源特定上下文标记，实现无需重新训练的有效分布外泛化。

Result: 在JUMP数据集上优于ComBat和Harmony等现有方法，在Bray等未见数据集上保持高性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作为基于图像的谱分析创建真正的基础模型迈出了重要一步，实现了更可靠和可扩展的跨研究生物分析。

Abstract: Large-scale biological discovery requires integrating massive, heterogeneous
datasets like those from the JUMP Cell Painting consortium, but technical batch
effects and a lack of generalizable models remain critical roadblocks. To
address this, we introduce CellPainTR, a Transformer-based architecture
designed to learn foundational representations of cellular morphology that are
robust to batch effects. Unlike traditional methods that require retraining on
new data, CellPainTR's design, featuring source-specific context tokens, allows
for effective out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to entirely unseen
datasets without fine-tuning. We validate CellPainTR on the large-scale JUMP
dataset, where it outperforms established methods like ComBat and Harmony in
both batch integration and biological signal preservation. Critically, we
demonstrate its robustness through a challenging OOD task on the unseen Bray et
al. dataset, where it maintains high performance despite significant domain and
feature shifts. Our work represents a significant step towards creating truly
foundational models for image-based profiling, enabling more reliable and
scalable cross-study biological analysis.

Motivation: 单一视觉模态方法在铁路缺陷检测中存在过检测问题，当正常结构元件外观类似缺陷时容易出现误检。音频信息虽然不含高级语义，但可以提供补充信息来提升检测精度。

Method: 构建了YOLOv8n和Vision Transformer的多模态融合架构，从多个层（7、16、19）提取特征图，并与合成的音频表征进行融合，重点检测铁路断裂和表面缺陷两类缺陷。

Result: 在真实铁路数据集上评估，多模态融合方法比单一视觉方法提高了准确性和总体准确度0.2个百分点，学生t检验证明了统计显著性。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了多模态融合在铁路缺陷检测中的效果，通过结合视觉和音频信息可以有效减少过检测问题，提高检测精度。

Abstract: Multimodal fusion is a multimedia technique that has become popular in the
wide range of tasks where image information is accompanied by a signal/audio.
The latter may not convey highly semantic information, such as speech or music,
but some measures such as audio signal recorded by mics in the goal to detect
rail structure elements or defects. While classical detection approaches such
as You Only Look Once (YOLO) family detectors can be efficiently deployed for
defect detection on the image modality, the single modality approaches remain
limited. They yield an overdetection in case of the appearance similar to
normal structural elements. The paper proposes a new multimodal fusion
architecture built on the basis of domain rules with YOLO and Vision
transformer backbones. It integrates YOLOv8n for rapid object detection with a
Vision Transformer (ViT) to combine feature maps extracted from multiple layers
(7, 16, and 19) and synthesised audio representations for two defect classes:
rail Rupture and Surface defect. Fusion is performed between audio and image.
Experimental evaluation on a real-world railway dataset demonstrates that our
multimodal fusion improves precision and overall accuracy by 0.2 points
compared to the vision-only approach. Student's unpaired t-test also confirms
statistical significance of differences in the mean accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出ClaFR方法，通过分类器权重的正交分解构建类已知子空间，计算特征重构误差进行OOD检测，无需训练数据且性能领先


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于特征的后处理方法需要访问训练数据，这在数据隐私保护场景下不适用，需要开发不依赖训练数据的OOD检测方法

Method: 对分类器权重进行正交分解提取类已知子空间，将原始特征映射到该子空间获得新表示，通过计算子空间内的特征重构误差来确定OOD分数

Result: 在多个OOD基准测试中达到领先性能，且不需要访问训练数据

Conclusion: ClaFR是一种简单有效的后处理方法，通过子空间投影视角解决了数据隐私场景下的OOD检测问题，性能优异且无需训练数据

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection helps models identify data outside the
training categories, crucial for security applications. While feature-based
post-hoc methods address this by evaluating data differences in the feature
space without changing network parameters, they often require access to
training data, which may not be suitable for some data privacy scenarios. This
may not be suitable in scenarios where data privacy protection is a concern. In
this paper, we propose a simple yet effective post-hoc method, termed
Classifier-based Feature Reconstruction (ClaFR), from the perspective of
subspace projection. It first performs an orthogonal decomposition of the
classifier's weights to extract the class-known subspace, then maps the
original data features into this subspace to obtain new data representations.
Subsequently, the OOD score is determined by calculating the feature
reconstruction error of the data within the subspace. Compared to existing OOD
detection algorithms, our method does not require access to training data while
achieving leading performance on multiple OOD benchmarks. Our code is released
at https://github.com/Aie0923/ClaFR.

TL;DR: DIET-CP是一种简单的持续预训练策略，能够在极小数据集（仅1000张图像）上有效调整基础模型到新领域，无需标签和额外超参数搜索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决专业领域中数据集小、超参数搜索不可行以及预训练模型缺乏重要信息的问题，使基础模型能够适应新的数据分布。

Method: 使用简单的目标函数，无需标签，不引入比监督微调更多的超参数，适用于不同数据模态和骨干网络。

Result: 在DINOv3等最先进模型上仅使用1000张图像就能显著提升性能，且在不同数据模态和骨干网络上表现稳定。

Conclusion: DIET-CP是一种简单有效的持续预训练方法，能够在小数据集上稳定提升模型性能，适用于各种专业领域。

Abstract: Continued pretraining offers a promising solution for adapting foundation
models to a new target domain. However, in specialized domains, available
datasets are often very small, limiting the applicability of SSL methods
developed for large-scale pretraining and making hyperparameter search
infeasible. In addition, pretrained models are usually released as
backbone-weights only, lacking important information to continue pretraining.
We propose to bridge this gap with DIET-CP, a simple continued pretraining
strategy, where any strong foundation model can be steered towards the new data
distribution of interest. DIET-CP relies on a very simple objective, requires
no labels, and introduces no more hyperparameters than supervised finetuning.
It is stable across data modalities and backbone choices, while providing a
significant performance boost for state-of-the-art models such as DINOv3 using

### [43] [FedAPT: Federated Adversarial Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06992)
*Kun Zhai,Siheng Chen,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedAPT是一种新的联邦对抗提示调优方法，通过类别感知提示生成器和跨层生成器共享策略，解决了非IID设置下的类别信息差距问题，显著提升了联邦提示调优的对抗鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦提示调优(FPT)方法虽然高效，但训练出的模型容易受到对抗攻击，导致下游任务分类错误。特别是在非独立同分布(non-IID)设置下，存在客户端与全局模型之间的类别信息差距问题。

Method: 提出了FedAPT方法：1) 类别感知提示生成器，利用全局标签嵌入作为"信标"，从文本提示生成视觉提示；2) 跨层生成器共享策略，增强不同模型层之间的提示耦合。

Result: 在多个图像分类数据集上的实验表明，FedAPT在提升对抗鲁棒性方面显著优于现有方法，并且在跨域和跨数据集场景中表现出优异的泛化能力。

Conclusion: FedAPT有效解决了联邦提示调优中的对抗鲁棒性问题，特别是在非IID设置下的类别信息差距挑战，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Federated Prompt Tuning (FPT) is an efficient method for cross-client
collaborative fine-tuning of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However,
models tuned using FPT are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, leading to
misclassification in downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce Federated
Adversarial Prompt Tuning (\textbf{FedAPT}), a novel method designed to enhance
the adversarial robustness of FPT. We identify a key issue in FedAPT under
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings: a \textit{class
information gap} between clients and the global model. Clients rely solely on
limited local label information to generate adversarial samples for training,
while the global model must defend against adversarial attacks from global
labels. To address this issue, we propose a \textbf{class-aware prompt
generator} that generates visual prompts from text prompts. This generator is
guided by a \emph{Global Label Embedding} (serving as a ``beacon") which
encodes cross-client label information to create more globally-aligned visual
prompts. Additionally, we propose a \textbf{cross-layer generator sharing}
strategy to enhance prompt coupling across different layers of the model,
further boosting adversarial robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple
image classification datasets demonstrate the superiority of FedAPT in
improving adversarial robustness, outperforming existing methods by a large
margin. FedAPT also exhibits exceptional generalization in cross-domain and
cross-dataset scenarios, indicating its effectiveness in real-world
applications.

TL;DR: ViLD框架填补了学术评估与企业部署需求之间的差距，通过10个关键业务任务和创新的BlockWeaver算法，在真实数据集上评估开源视觉语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于选择题和合成数据的基准测试无法反映企业实际应用需求，需要建立更贴近真实业务场景的评估框架。

Method: 提出ViLD框架，定义10个业务关键任务；开发BlockWeaver算法用于无序OCR输出比较；构建包含7500个真实样本的基准数据集；结合语义匹配、传统指标和新方法进行综合评估。

Result: 在Qwen、MIMO和InternVL等开源VLM与专有基线的对比评估中，提供了业界首个基于任务的VLM能力评估，为企业在实际部署中提供可操作的见解。

Conclusion: ViLD框架成功连接了学术研究与企业应用需求，为开源视觉语言模型在企业环境中的部署提供了实用的评估标准和指导。

Abstract: Open-source Vision-Language Models show immense promise for enterprise
applications, yet a critical disconnect exists between academic evaluation and
enterprise deployment requirements. Current benchmarks rely heavily on
multiple-choice questions and synthetic data, failing to capture the complexity
of real-world business applications like social media content analysis. This
paper introduces VLM-in-the-Wild (ViLD), a comprehensive framework to bridge
this gap by evaluating VLMs on operational enterprise requirements. We define
ten business-critical tasks: logo detection, OCR, object detection, human
presence and demographic analysis, human activity and appearance analysis,
scene detection, camera perspective and media quality assessment, dominant
colors, comprehensive description, and NSFW detection. To this framework, we
bring an innovative BlockWeaver Algorithm that solves the challenging problem
of comparing unordered, variably-grouped OCR outputs from VLMs without relying
on embeddings or LLMs, achieving remarkable speed and reliability. To
demonstrate efficacy of ViLD, we constructed a new benchmark dataset of 7,500
diverse samples, carefully stratified from a corpus of one million real-world
images and videos. ViLD provides actionable insights by combining semantic
matching (both embedding-based and LLM-as-a-judge approaches), traditional
metrics, and novel methods to measure the completeness and faithfulness of
descriptive outputs. By benchmarking leading open-source VLMs (Qwen, MIMO, and
InternVL) against a powerful proprietary baseline as per ViLD framework, we
provide one of the first industry-grounded, task-driven assessment of VLMs
capabilities, offering actionable insights for their deployment in enterprise
environments.

### [46] [The Protocol Genome A Self Supervised Learning Framework from DICOM Headers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06995)
*Jimmy Joseph*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Protocol Genome是一个自监督学习系统，通过分析DICOM头部信息来学习协议相关性，在外部验证中达到AUROC 0.901，显著优于基线方法，并改善了跨模态和厂商的校准和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床影像通过PACS/DICOM系统处理，其中扫描协议选择（扫描仪型号、序列、参数等）会影响图像对比度、噪声和伪影。这些潜在混杂因素阻碍了仅基于图像的神经网络在不同站点间的泛化能力。

Method: 将结构化DICOM头部作为标签，学习协议感知但临床鲁棒的图像表示。Protocol Genome获取去标识化头部字段的标记化嵌入，并通过三种方式与图像特征联合建模：(1)协议-图像对比学习，(2)掩码协议预测，(3)协议-协议转换。

Result: 在126万项研究（7个医疗系统，31台扫描仪，3个厂商；CT、MR、CR/DR）上实验显示，Protocol Genome在三个任务上均获得显著提升：肺栓塞分类(+0.046)、脑胶质瘤分级(+0.058)、心胸比检测(+0.041)，外部AUROC更高，校准改善25-37%。

Conclusion: 该方法减少了协议边界处的假阳性，适用于PACS系统，即使在10-20%标注数据下也能保持性能优势，并提供了模型卡片和部署指南，包括去标识化和偏见审计。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Protocol Genome, a self-supervised learning
system that learns correlations from DICOM headers and achieves AUROC 0.901 (vs
0.847 baseline) and ECE 0.036 (vs 0.058) on fully held-out external validation.
Our method also improves calibration and robustness across modalities (CT, MRI,
CXR) and vendors. Clinical imaging is funneled through PACS/DICOM, where
procedure choices (scanner make/model, sequence, kernel, kVp, TR/TE, and slice
thickness) have consequences for contrast, noise, and artifact. These latent
confounders impede the generalization of image-only networks across sites. We
consider structured DICOM headers as a label and learn protocol-aware but
clinically robust image representations. Protocol Genome obtains tokenized
embeddings of de-identified header fields and models them along with image
features using: (1) protocol-image contrastive learning, (2) masked protocol
prediction, and (3) protocol-protocol translation. With 1.26M studies (7 health
systems, 31 scanners, 3 vendors; CT, MR, CR/DR), we experiment on: (A) chest CT
triage for PE, (B) brain MRI glioma grading, and (C) chest radiograph
cardiomegaly detection. Relative to strong SSL baselines (SimCLR, MAE) as well
as ImageNet transfer, Protocol Genome (+0.046: PE, +0.058: glioma, +0.041:
cardiomegaly) is associated with higher external AUROC; 25-37% calibration
improvements are obtained (p < 0.01, DeLong tests). While the gains may be
task-dependent, they are preserved with 10-20% of labeled data. From a clinical
point of view, the technique reduces false positives at protocol borders and is
applicable in a PACS (DICOM C-FIND/C-MOVE, DICOMweb QIDO/WADO). We publish a
model card and deployment guide, complete with both de-identification and bias
audits.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了视觉语言模型对文字损坏的识别能力，发现当代VLMs在字符碎片化、融合或遮挡时表现差强，而人类则显示出高度弹性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类与模型在文字识别弹性上的差异，探索VLMs是否具备像人类一样的符号识别冒透能力。

Method: 构建了中文象形文字和英文拼写文字两个冗余性测试标准，通过切割、重组和叠加字形创造"可见但不可读"的刺激物。

Result: 当代VLMs在干净文本上表现强劲，但在这些干扰下性能严重下降，经常产生无关或不连贯的输出。

Conclusion: 模型过于依赖通用视觉不变性，而不够重视组合性先验知识，需要编码符号分割、组合和绑定的新架构和训练策略。

Abstract: Writing is a universal cultural technology that reuses vision for symbolic
communication. Humans display striking resilience: we readily recognize words
even when characters are fragmented, fused, or partially occluded. This paper
investigates whether advanced vision language models (VLMs) share this
resilience. We construct two psychophysics inspired benchmarks across distinct
writing systems, Chinese logographs and English alphabetic words, by splicing,
recombining, and overlaying glyphs to yield ''visible but unreadable'' stimuli
for models while remaining legible to humans. Despite strong performance on
clean text, contemporary VLMs show a severe drop under these perturbations,
frequently producing unrelated or incoherent outputs. The pattern suggests a
structural limitation: models heavily leverage generic visual invariances but
under rely on compositional priors needed for robust literacy. We release
stimuli generation code, prompts, and evaluation protocols to facilitate
transparent replication and follow up work. Our findings motivate architectures
and training strategies that encode symbol segmentation, composition, and
binding across scripts, and they delineate concrete challenges for deploying
multimodal systems in education, accessibility, cultural heritage, and
security.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种在频域进行特征级学习的动态心脏MRI重建方法，通过时间融合策略生成k空间数据，在低数据量情况下仍能稳定生成高质量图像


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于心脏磁共振成像的动态性和复杂性，高质量且多样化的k空间数据在实践中很难获得，这阻碍了动态心脏MRI的鲁棒重建

Method: 在频域进行特征级学习，利用傅里叶变换的全局表示能力，将频域视为自然全局特征空间；采用时间融合策略整合不同时间帧的k空间数据来指导生成过程

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在低数据量情况下具有很强的生成能力

Conclusion: 该方法具有缓解动态MRI重建中数据稀缺问题的实际潜力

Abstract: Owing to the inherently dynamic and complex characteristics of cardiac
magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, high-quality and diverse k-space data are
rarely available in practice, which in turn hampers robust reconstruction of
dynamic cardiac MRI. To address this challenge, we perform feature-level
learning directly in the frequency domain and employ a temporal-fusion strategy
as the generative guidance to synthesize k-space data. Specifically, leveraging
the global representation capacity of the Fourier transform, the frequency
domain can be considered a natural global feature space. Therefore, unlike
traditional methods that use pixel-level convolution for feature learning and
modeling in the image domain, this letter focuses on feature-level modeling in
the frequency domain, enabling stable and rich generation even with ultra
low-data regimes. Moreover, leveraging the advantages of feature-level modeling
in the frequency domain, we integrate k-space data across time frames with
multiple fusion strategies to steer and further optimize the generative
trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method possesses
strong generative ability in low-data regimes, indicating practical potential
to alleviate data scarcity in dynamic MRI reconstruction.

TL;DR: 这篇论文首次明确评估了属性预测模型在语义和感知差异较大的类别间的演续性能力，发现模型在训练测试集相关性降低时性能冲击显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估模型是否能够将属性知识演续到语义和感知上差异较大的类别，解决以前工作仅在窄范围内进行属性预测的限制。

Method: 通过五种训练测试集分割策略（LLM语义分组、嵌入相似度阈值、嵌入聚类、超类分区）逐渐降低训练测试集相关性，测试模型在无关对象类型间的属性推理能力。

Result: 随着训练测试集相关性降低，模型性能冲击显著，其中聚类方法在降低隐藏相关性和保持可学习性方面效果最佳。

Conclusion: 当前表示方法对分割设计敏感性强，这为理解当前表示的限制和构建未来属性推理测试基准提供了新见解。

Abstract: Can models generalize attribute knowledge across semantically and
perceptually dissimilar categories? While prior work has addressed attribute
prediction within narrow taxonomic or visually similar domains, it remains
unclear whether current models can abstract attributes and apply them to
conceptually distant categories. This work presents the first explicit
evaluation for the robustness of the attribute prediction task under such
conditions, testing whether models can correctly infer shared attributes
between unrelated object types: e.g., identifying that the attribute "has four
legs" is common to both "dogs" and "chairs". To enable this evaluation, we
introduce train-test split strategies that progressively reduce correlation
between training and test sets, based on: LLM-driven semantic grouping,
embedding similarity thresholding, embedding-based clustering, and
supercategory-based partitioning using ground-truth labels. Results show a
sharp drop in performance as the correlation between training and test
categories decreases, indicating strong sensitivity to split design. Among the
evaluated methods, clustering yields the most effective trade-off, reducing
hidden correlations while preserving learnability. These findings offer new
insights into the limitations of current representations and inform future
benchmark construction for attribute reasoning.

*Ahmed R. Sadik,Mariusz Bujny*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于人类参与的量化评估框架，用于评估大语言模型生成的3D形状的几何和结构保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型能够解释多模态输入生成复杂3D形状，但现有方法在评估几何和结构保真度方面仍然不充分。需要开发更稳健的评估方法来支持CAD设计民主化、反向工程和快速原型制造等应用。

Method: 提出了一套综合的相似性和复杂性指标，包括体积准确性、表面对齐度、尺寸保真度和拓扑复杂度，用于将生成模型与真实CAD参考进行对比。使用L垂直板组件作为案例研究，系统比较了四种输入模态的性能：2D正交视图、等质图绘图、几何结构树和代码基于的纠正提示。

Result: 研究发现，随着语义丰富度的提升，生成保真度有所改善，其中代码级别提示在所有指标上都实现了完美的重建。该量化评估方法能够显著提高向真实值的收敛速度，特别是与依靠纯视觉检查和人类直觉的传统定性方法相比。

Conclusion: 这项工作不仅推进了对AI辅助形状合成的理解，还提供了一种可扩展的方法论来验证和精炼生成模型，以满足多样化的CAD应用需求。

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly capable of interpreting multimodal
inputs to generate complex 3D shapes, yet robust methods to evaluate geometric
and structural fidelity remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces a human in
the loop framework for the quantitative evaluation of LLM generated 3D models,
supporting applications such as democratization of CAD design, reverse
engineering of legacy designs, and rapid prototyping. We propose a
comprehensive suite of similarity and complexity metrics, including volumetric
accuracy, surface alignment, dimensional fidelity, and topological intricacy,
to benchmark generated models against ground truth CAD references. Using an L
bracket component as a case study, we systematically compare LLM performance
across four input modalities: 2D orthographic views, isometric sketches,
geometric structure trees, and code based correction prompts. Our findings
demonstrate improved generation fidelity with increased semantic richness, with
code level prompts achieving perfect reconstruction across all metrics. A key
contribution of this work is demonstrating that our proposed quantitative
evaluation approach enables significantly faster convergence toward the ground
truth, especially compared to traditional qualitative methods based solely on
visual inspection and human intuition. This work not only advances the
understanding of AI assisted shape synthesis but also provides a scalable
methodology to validate and refine generative models for diverse CAD
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅技术在边缘设备上应用受限，主要因为高内存消耗。现有压缩方法多关注存储压缩，未能解决渲染内存瓶颈问题。

Method: 使用轻量级任意方向球形高斯瓣替代内存密集的球谐函数作为颜色表示，并提出统一的软剪枝框架，将基元数量和瓣数量剪枝建模为约束优化问题。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了3D高斯泼溅的内存瓶颈问题，为边缘设备部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a dominant novel-view synthesis
technique, but its high memory consumption severely limits its applicability on
edge devices. A growing number of 3DGS compression methods have been proposed
to make 3DGS more efficient, yet most only focus on storage compression and
fail to address the critical bottleneck of rendering memory. To address this
problem, we introduce MEGS$^{2}$, a novel memory-efficient framework that
tackles this challenge by jointly optimizing two key factors: the total
primitive number and the parameters per primitive, achieving unprecedented
memory compression. Specifically, we replace the memory-intensive spherical
harmonics with lightweight arbitrarily-oriented spherical Gaussian lobes as our
color representations. More importantly, we propose a unified soft pruning
framework that models primitive-number and lobe-number pruning as a single
constrained optimization problem. Experiments show that MEGS$^{2}$ achieves a
50% static VRAM reduction and a 40% rendering VRAM reduction compared to
existing methods, while maintaining comparable rendering quality.

Motivation: 现有高斯性正则化方法存在局限性，需要一种统一框架来有效强制潜在空间样本符合标准高斯分布，以促进文本到图像模型中涉及潜在空间优化的下游任务。

Method: 将高维样本元素视为一维标准高斯变量，结合空间域矩正则化和频谱域功率谱正则化构建复合损失函数，并通过随机排列输入确保排列不变性。

Result: 该方法在生成建模中用于测试时奖励对齐（提升美学质量和文本对齐）时表现优异，优于先前的高斯性正则化方法，有效防止奖励黑客攻击并加速收敛。

Conclusion: 提出的统一正则化框架成功实现了潜在空间的标准高斯性约束，为文本到图像模型的潜在空间优化任务提供了有效的正则化解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a novel regularization loss that enforces standard Gaussianity,
encouraging samples to align with a standard Gaussian distribution. This
facilitates a range of downstream tasks involving optimization in the latent
space of text-to-image models. We treat elements of a high-dimensional sample
as one-dimensional standard Gaussian variables and define a composite loss that
combines moment-based regularization in the spatial domain with power
spectrum-based regularization in the spectral domain. Since the expected values
of moments and power spectrum distributions are analytically known, the loss
promotes conformity to these properties. To ensure permutation invariance, the
losses are applied to randomly permuted inputs. Notably, existing
Gaussianity-based regularizations fall within our unified framework: some
correspond to moment losses of specific orders, while the previous
covariance-matching loss is equivalent to our spectral loss but incurs higher
time complexity due to its spatial-domain computation. We showcase the
application of our regularization in generative modeling for test-time reward
alignment with a text-to-image model, specifically to enhance aesthetics and
text alignment. Our regularization outperforms previous Gaussianity
regularization, effectively prevents reward hacking and accelerates
convergence.

Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical task in microscopy, essential for accurately
analyzing and interpreting complex visual data. This task can be performed
using custom models trained on domain-specific datasets, transfer learning from
pre-trained models, or foundational models that offer broad applicability.
However, foundational models often present a considerable number of
non-transparent tuning parameters that require extensive manual optimization,
limiting their usability for real-time streaming data analysis. Here, we
introduce a reward function-based optimization to fine-tune foundational models
and illustrate this approach for SAM (Segment Anything Model) framework by
Meta. The reward functions can be constructed to represent the physics of the
imaged system, including particle size distributions, geometries, and other
criteria. By integrating a reward-driven optimization framework, we enhance
SAM's adaptability and performance, leading to an optimized variant, SAM$^{*}$,
that better aligns with the requirements of diverse segmentation tasks and
particularly allows for real-time streaming data segmentation. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of this approach in microscopy imaging, where precise
segmentation is crucial for analyzing cellular structures, material interfaces,
and nanoscale features.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Aymara图像公平性评估基准，用于评估AI生成图像中的社会偏见，发现大型多模态模型不仅复制而且放大了职业性别刻板印象，存在显著的默认男性偏见，且不同模型的偏见程度差异很大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究虽然识别了大型多模态模型中的性别偏见，但方法学限制阻碍了大规模、可比较的跨模型分析。需要开发标准化评估工具来促进AI开发的问责制和公平性。

Method: 使用75个程序生成的性别中性提示词，测试13个商业可用的大型多模态模型，生成 stereotypically-male、stereotypically-female 和非刻板印象职业的人物图像，然后使用经过验证的LLM-as-a-judge系统对965张生成图像进行性别代表性评分。

Result: 研究发现：1）LMMs系统性放大职业性别刻板印象，在男性刻板职业中生成93.0%男性图像，女性刻板职业中仅22.5%男性图像；2）存在强烈默认男性偏见，非刻板职业中68.3%生成男性；3）不同模型偏见程度差异显著（46.7%-73.3%男性比例）。

Conclusion: 高度偏见并非不可避免的结果，而是设计选择的结果。最佳性能模型能够去放大性别刻板印象并接近性别平等，表明通过改进设计可以实现更公平的AI系统。需要标准化自动化评估工具来促进AI公平性。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have revolutionized text-to-image generation,
but they risk perpetuating the harmful social biases in their training data.
Prior work has identified gender bias in these models, but methodological
limitations prevented large-scale, comparable, cross-model analysis. To address
this gap, we introduce the Aymara Image Fairness Evaluation, a benchmark for
assessing social bias in AI-generated images. We test 13 commercially available
LMMs using 75 procedurally-generated, gender-neutral prompts to generate people
in stereotypically-male, stereotypically-female, and non-stereotypical
professions. We then use a validated LLM-as-a-judge system to score the 965
resulting images for gender representation. Our results reveal (p < .001 for
all): 1) LMMs systematically not only reproduce but actually amplify
occupational gender stereotypes relative to real-world labor data, generating
men in 93.0% of images for male-stereotyped professions but only 22.5% for
female-stereotyped professions; 2) Models exhibit a strong default-male bias,
generating men in 68.3% of the time for non-stereotyped professions; and 3) The
extent of bias varies dramatically across models, with overall male
representation ranging from 46.7% to 73.3%. Notably, the top-performing model
de-amplified gender stereotypes and approached gender parity, achieving the
highest fairness scores. This variation suggests high bias is not an inevitable
outcome but a consequence of design choices. Our work provides the most
comprehensive cross-model benchmark of gender bias to date and underscores the
necessity of standardized, automated evaluation tools for promoting
accountability and fairness in AI development.

Conclusion: 提出的块稀疏注意力机制有效解决了transformer模型在多视图重建中的计算瓶颈问题，为VGGT和π³等模型提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient and accurate feed-forward multi-view reconstruction has long been
an important task in computer vision. Recent transformer-based models like VGGT
and $\pi^3$ have achieved impressive results with simple architectures, yet
they face an inherent runtime bottleneck, due to the quadratic complexity of
the global attention layers, that limits the scalability to large image sets.
In this paper, we empirically analyze the global attention matrix of these
models and observe that probability mass concentrates on a small subset of
patch-patch interactions that correspond to cross-view geometric matches.
Motivated by the structured attention and inspired by recent advancement in
large language models, we propose a replacement for the dense global attention
operation based on highly optimized block-sparse kernels, yielding up to
$4\times$ faster inference with comparable task performance. Our retrofit
requires no retraining of the backbone, extends to both VGGT and $\pi^3$, and
supports large image collections. Evaluations on a comprehensive suite of
multi-view benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前将视觉惯性里程计(VIO)卸载到边缘服务器的趋势导致服务器端存在威胁面，细微的姿态欺骗攻击可以累积成显著漂移，同时规避启发式检查。

Method: 在无攻击会话上训练模型学习运动的时间规律性，检测运行时偏差并启动恢复机制来恢复姿态一致性。使用ILLIXR测试床在真实卸载VIO环境中评估，涵盖多种欺骗强度。

Result: 实验结果显示，在轨迹和姿态误差等性能指标上，相比无防御基线有显著降低。

Conclusion: 提出的无监督检测和恢复机制能有效应对VIO系统中的姿态欺骗攻击，提高系统安全性。

Abstract: Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) supports immersive Virtual Reality (VR) by
fusing camera and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data for real-time pose.
However, current trend of offloading VIO to edge servers can lead server-side
threat surface where subtle pose spoofing can accumulate into substantial
drift, while evading heuristic checks. In this paper, we study this threat and
present an unsupervised, label-free detection and recovery mechanism. The
proposed model is trained on attack-free sessions to learn temporal
regularities of motion to detect runtime deviations and initiate recovery to
restore pose consistency. We evaluate the approach in a realistic offloaded-VIO
environment using ILLIXR testbed across multiple spoofing intensities.
Experimental results in terms of well-known performance metrics show
substantial reductions in trajectory and pose error compared to a no-defense
baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究假设人脸增强技术在提升感知质量的同时会降低深度伪造检测器的性能，旨在系统评估这些技术是否可以作为反取证工具使用。

Method: 使用传统图像处理方法和先进的基于GAN的增强技术，评估对朴素、空间和基于频率的检测方法的影响，并进行对抗训练实验来测试模型鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，即使是基础增强滤镜也能显著降低检测准确率（ASR达64.63%），而GAN-based技术进一步利用这些漏洞（ASR达75.12%）。

Conclusion: 人脸增强方法能有效作为反取证工具，强调需要开发更具弹性和适应性的取证方法。

Abstract: Face enhancement techniques are widely used to enhance facial appearance.
However, they can inadvertently distort biometric features, leading to
significant decrease in the accuracy of deepfake detectors. This study
hypothesizes that these techniques, while improving perceptual quality, can
degrade the performance of deepfake detectors. To investigate this, we
systematically evaluate whether commonly used face enhancement methods can
serve an anti-forensic role by reducing detection accuracy. We use both
traditional image processing methods and advanced GAN-based enhancements to
evaluate the robustness of deepfake detectors. We provide a comprehensive
analysis of the effectiveness of these enhancement techniques, focusing on
their impact on Na\"ive, Spatial, and Frequency-based detection methods.
Furthermore, we conduct adversarial training experiments to assess whether
exposure to face enhancement transformations improves model robustness.
Experiments conducted on the FaceForensics++, DeepFakeDetection, and CelebDF-v2
datasets indicate that even basic enhancement filters can significantly reduce
detection accuracy achieving ASR up to 64.63\%. In contrast, GAN-based
techniques further exploit these vulnerabilities, achieving ASR up to 75.12\%.
Our results demonstrate that face enhancement methods can effectively function
as anti-forensic tools, emphasizing the need for more resilient and adaptive
forensic methods.

Motivation: 监督学习需要大量标注数据，但在开放世界场景中，新类别可能随时出现。现有方法主要关注半监督学习，本文探索完全无监督的新类发现方法。

Method: 使用Vision Transformers生成向量嵌入，通过注意力机制估计聚类数量，并结合流形学习技术利用数据内在几何结构来优化嵌入表示。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、ImageNet-100和Tiny ImageNet数据集上实现了单模态聚类和新类发现的最先进结果，无论聚类数量是否已知。

Conclusion: 提出的完全无监督方法能够有效发现图像数据集中的新类别，为开放世界场景下的新类发现问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Working with annotated data is the cornerstone of supervised learning.
Nevertheless, providing labels to instances is a task that requires significant
human effort. Several critical real-world applications make things more
complicated because no matter how many labels may have been identified in a
task of interest, it could be the case that examples corresponding to novel
classes may appear in the future. Not unsurprisingly, prior work in this,
so-called, `open-world' context has focused a lot on semi-supervised
approaches.
  Focusing on image classification, somehow paradoxically, we propose a fully
unsupervised approach to the problem of determining the novel categories in a
particular dataset. Our approach relies on estimating the number of clusters
using Vision Transformers, which utilize attention mechanisms to generate
vector embeddings. Furthermore, we incorporate manifold learning techniques to
refine these embeddings by exploiting the intrinsic geometry of the data,
thereby enhancing the overall image clustering performance. Overall, we
establish new State-of-the-Art results on single-modal clustering and Novel
Class Discovery on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Tiny ImageNet. We do
so, both when the number of clusters is known or unknown ahead of time. The

*Raja Mallina,Bryar Shareef*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XBusNet是一种双提示双分支多模态模型，通过结合全局语义和局部边界精确性，在乳腺超声分割任务中实现了独特的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确的乳腺超声分割对于可靠测量和定量分析至关重要，但小或低对比度病变因模糊边缘和斑点噪声而难以分割。文本提示能添加临床上下文，但直接应用弱定位文本-图像线索往往产生粗糕的分割结果。

Method: 提出XBusNet模型，采用双提示双分支设计。全局路径基于CLIP Vision Transformer，编码整体图像语义；局部U-Net路径强调精确边界，通过描述形状、边缘和BI-RADS术语的提示进行调制。提示从结构化元数据自动生成，无需手动点击。

Result: 在BLU数据集上进行五折交叉验证，XBusNet实现了最佳性能，平均Dice系数为0.8765，IoU为0.8149，超迈六个强基线模型。小病变显示出最大收益，缺失区域和偏偏激活更少。分离研究显示了全局上下文、局部边界建模和提示调制的补充作用。

Conclusion: 双提示双分支多模态设计通过融合全局语义和局部精确性，能够产生准确的乳腺超声分割掩码，提高小、低对比度病变的稳健性。

Abstract: Background: Precise breast ultrasound (BUS) segmentation supports reliable
measurement, quantitative analysis, and downstream classification, yet remains
difficult for small or low-contrast lesions with fuzzy margins and speckle
noise. Text prompts can add clinical context, but directly applying weakly
localized text-image cues (e.g., CAM/CLIP-derived signals) tends to produce
coarse, blob-like responses that smear boundaries unless additional mechanisms
recover fine edges. Methods: We propose XBusNet, a novel dual-prompt,
dual-branch multimodal model that combines image features with clinically
grounded text. A global pathway based on a CLIP Vision Transformer encodes
whole-image semantics conditioned on lesion size and location, while a local
U-Net pathway emphasizes precise boundaries and is modulated by prompts that
describe shape, margin, and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS)
terms. Prompts are assembled automatically from structured metadata, requiring
no manual clicks. We evaluate on the Breast Lesions USG (BLU) dataset using
five-fold cross-validation. Primary metrics are Dice and Intersection over
Union (IoU); we also conduct size-stratified analyses and ablations to assess
the roles of the global and local paths and the text-driven modulation.
Results: XBusNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on BLU, with mean Dice
of 0.8765 and IoU of 0.8149, outperforming six strong baselines. Small lesions
show the largest gains, with fewer missed regions and fewer spurious
activations. Ablation studies show complementary contributions of global
context, local boundary modeling, and prompt-based modulation. Conclusions: A
dual-prompt, dual-branch multimodal design that merges global semantics with
local precision yields accurate BUS segmentation masks and improves robustness
for small, low-contrast lesions.

Result: 达到98.0%准确率和98.1%敏感度，显著超过传统方法和ProGAN基线

Conclusion: 高级生成模型与可解释特征的协同效应能构建高准确医疗诊断工具

Abstract: Data scarcity hinders deep learning for medical imaging. We propose a
framework for breast cancer classification in thermograms that addresses this
using a Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) for data augmentation. Our
DPM-based augmentation is shown to be superior to both traditional methods and
a ProGAN baseline. The framework fuses deep features from a pre-trained
ResNet-50 with handcrafted nonlinear features (e.g., Fractal Dimension) derived
from U-Net segmented tumors. An XGBoost classifier trained on these fused
features achieves 98.0\% accuracy and 98.1\% sensitivity. Ablation studies and
statistical tests confirm that both the DPM augmentation and the nonlinear
feature fusion are critical, statistically significant components of this
success. This work validates the synergy between advanced generative models and
interpretable features for creating highly accurate medical diagnostic tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态模型训练依赖图像-文本对，但文本标注通常稀疏且缺乏细粒度视觉细节，导致理解与生成之间存在偏差

Method: RecA利用模型自身的视觉理解嵌入作为条件，通过自监督重建损失优化图像重建，实现理解与生成的对齐

Result: 仅用27 GPU小时，在GenEval(0.73→0.90)和DPGBench(80.93→88.15)上显著提升生成性能，编辑基准也有改善(ImgEdit 3.38→3.75, GEdit 6.94→7.25)，超越更大开源模型

Conclusion: RecA是一种高效通用的后训练对齐策略，适用于各种多模态架构，能有效提升生成和编辑保真度

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) unify visual understanding and generation
within a single architecture. However, conventional training relies on
image-text pairs (or sequences) whose captions are typically sparse and miss
fine-grained visual details--even when they use hundreds of words to describe a
simple image. We introduce Reconstruction Alignment (RecA), a
resource-efficient post-training method that leverages visual understanding
encoder embeddings as dense "text prompts," providing rich supervision without
captions. Concretely, RecA conditions a UMM on its own visual understanding
embeddings and optimizes it to reconstruct the input image with a
self-supervised reconstruction loss, thereby realigning understanding and
generation. Despite its simplicity, RecA is broadly applicable: across
autoregressive, masked-autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs, it
consistently improves generation and editing fidelity. With only 27 GPU-hours,
post-training with RecA substantially improves image generation performance on
GenEval (0.73$\rightarrow$0.90) and DPGBench (80.93$\rightarrow$88.15), while
also boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38$\rightarrow$3.75, GEdit
6.94$\rightarrow$7.25). Notably, RecA surpasses much larger open-source models
and applies broadly across diverse UMM architectures, establishing it as an
efficient and general post-training alignment strategy for UMMs

Motivation: 解决无人机多光谱目标检测面临的三个挑战：低光照图像降低多模态融合互补性、局部小目标建模受冗余信息干扰、基于Transformer的方法计算复杂度高难以在无人机平台应用

Method: 设计双域增强模块(DDE)包含跨尺度小波Mamba(CSWM)和傅里叶细节恢复块(FDR)来增强低光照图像；设计优先级引导Mamba融合模块(PGMF)通过优先级扫描从局部目标特征开始融合

Result: 在DroneVehicle和VEDAI数据集上的实验表明，DEPF在目标检测方面优于最先进的方法

Conclusion: 基于Mamba线性复杂度的DEPF方法有效解决了无人机多光谱目标检测的关键挑战，在性能和效率方面都表现出色

Abstract: Multispectral remote sensing object detection is one of the important
application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). However, it faces three
challenges. Firstly, the low-light remote sensing images reduce the
complementarity during multi-modality fusion. Secondly, the local small target
modeling is interfered with redundant information in the fusion stage easily.
Thirdly, due to the quadratic computational complexity, it is hard to apply the
transformer-based methods on the UAV platform. To address these limitations,
motivated by Mamba with linear complexity, a UAV multispectral object detector
with dual-domain enhancement and priority-guided mamba fusion (DEPF) is
proposed. Firstly, to enhance low-light remote sensing images, Dual-Domain
Enhancement Module (DDE) is designed, which contains Cross-Scale Wavelet Mamba
(CSWM) and Fourier Details Recovery block (FDR). CSWM applies cross-scale mamba
scanning for the low-frequency components to enhance the global brightness of
images, while FDR constructs spectrum recovery network to enhance the frequency
spectra features for recovering the texture-details. Secondly, to enhance local
target modeling and reduce the impact of redundant information during fusion,
Priority-Guided Mamba Fusion Module (PGMF) is designed. PGMF introduces the
concept of priority scanning, which starts from local targets features
according to the priority scores obtained from modality difference. Experiments
on DroneVehicle dataset and VEDAI dataset reports that, DEPF performs well on
object detection, comparing with state-of-the-art methods. Our code is
available in the supplementary material.

Motivation: 现有的图卷积网络(GCNs)在骨架动作识别中虽然有效，但在区分模糊动作方面存在局限性，主要因为学习到的拓扑和空间特征表示不足

Method: 提出Gaussian Topology Refinement Gated Graph Convolution (G$^{3}$CN)：1) 使用高斯滤波器细化骨架拓扑图 2) 在GCN框架中集成门控循环单元(GRUs)增强骨架点间信息传播

Result: 在NTU RGB+D、NTU RGB+D 120和NW-UCLA基准测试上取得优异表现，特别是在模糊样本的动作识别方面有显著提升

Conclusion: G$^{3}$CN方法能有效改善骨架动作识别性能，尤其在区分模糊动作方面表现出色，且具有良好的泛化能力

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have proven to be highly effective for
skeleton-based action recognition, primarily due to their ability to leverage
graph topology for feature aggregation, a key factor in extracting meaningful
representations. However, despite their success, GCNs often struggle to
effectively distinguish between ambiguous actions, revealing limitations in the
representation of learned topological and spatial features. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel approach, Gaussian Topology Refinement Gated
Graph Convolution (G$^{3}$CN), to address the challenge of distinguishing
ambiguous actions in skeleton-based action recognition. G$^{3}$CN incorporates
a Gaussian filter to refine the skeleton topology graph, improving the
representation of ambiguous actions. Additionally, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)
are integrated into the GCN framework to enhance information propagation
between skeleton points. Our method shows strong generalization across various
GCN backbones. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA
benchmarks demonstrate that G$^{3}$CN effectively improves action recognition,
particularly for ambiguous samples.

Motivation: 现有解析图方法主要关注单模态建模，忽略了多模态融合的潜力。语言提供了丰富的空间关系先验，但现有的全局特征融合方法在遮挡区域响应弱且存在对齐定位问题

Method: 提出PGVL模型，包含引导模块(GM)：低层节点关注局部特征保持遮挡区域响应，高层节点整合全局特征推断遮挡部位；采用自上而下分解和自下而上组合的两阶段方法，先构建模态特定解析图，再使用递归双向交叉注意力并通过GM净化

Result: 在主流姿态估计数据集上验证了PGVL和相应网络的有效性

Conclusion: PGVL通过多模态交互和引导机制，有效解决了遮挡场景下的人体姿态估计问题，代码即将发布

Abstract: Parse graphs boost human pose estimation (HPE) by integrating context and
hierarchies, yet prior work mostly focuses on single modality modeling,
ignoring the potential of multimodal fusion. Notably, language offers rich HPE
priors like spatial relations for occluded scenes, but existing visual-language
fusion via global feature integration weakens occluded region responses and
causes alignment and location failures. To address this issue, we propose Parse
Graph-based Visual-Language interaction (PGVL) with a core novel Guided Module
(GM). In PGVL, low-level nodes focus on local features, maximizing the
maintenance of responses in occluded areas and high-level nodes integrate
global features to infer occluded or invisible parts. GM enables high semantic
nodes to guide the feature update of low semantic nodes that have undergone
cross attention. It ensuring effective fusion of diverse information. PGVL
includes top-down decomposition and bottom-up composition. In the first stage,
modality specific parse graphs are constructed. Next stage. recursive
bidirectional cross-attention is used, purified by GM. We also design network
based on PGVL. The PGVL and our network is validated on major pose estimation
datasets. We will release the code soon.

Conclusion: LGAA框架成功实现了端到端的PBR就绪3D资产生成，通过知识保留方案实现了数据高效的训练，为自主3D资产创建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The labor- and experience-intensive creation of 3D assets with physically
based rendering (PBR) materials demands an autonomous 3D asset creation
pipeline. However, most existing 3D generation methods focus on geometry
modeling, either baking textures into simple vertex colors or leaving texture
synthesis to post-processing with image diffusion models. To achieve end-to-end
PBR-ready 3D asset generation, we present Lightweight Gaussian Asset Adapter
(LGAA), a novel framework that unifies the modeling of geometry and PBR
materials by exploiting multi-view (MV) diffusion priors from a novel
perspective. The LGAA features a modular design with three components.
Specifically, the LGAA Wrapper reuses and adapts network layers from MV
diffusion models, which encapsulate knowledge acquired from billions of images,
enabling better convergence in a data-efficient manner. To incorporate multiple
diffusion priors for geometry and PBR synthesis, the LGAA Switcher aligns
multiple LGAA Wrapper layers encapsulating different knowledge. Then, a tamed
variational autoencoder (VAE), termed LGAA Decoder, is designed to predict 2D
Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) with PBR channels. Finally, we introduce a dedicated
post-processing procedure to effectively extract high-quality, relightable mesh
assets from the resulting 2DGS. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of LGAA with both text-and
image-conditioned MV diffusion models. Additionally, the modular design enables
flexible incorporation of multiple diffusion priors, and the
knowledge-preserving scheme leads to efficient convergence trained on merely
69k multi-view instances. Our code, pre-trained weights, and the dataset used
will be publicly available via our project page:

Abstract: The emergence of advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has
significantly enhanced AI assistants' ability to process complex information
across modalities. Recently, egocentric videos, by directly capturing user
focus, actions, and context in an unified coordinate, offer an exciting
opportunity to enable proactive and personalized AI user experiences with
MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks overlook the crucial role of gaze as an
indicator of user intent. To address this gap, we introduce EgoGazeVQA, an
egocentric gaze-guided video question answering benchmark that leverages gaze
information to improve the understanding of longer daily-life videos.
EgoGazeVQA consists of gaze-based QA pairs generated by MLLMs and refined by
human annotators. Our experiments reveal that existing MLLMs struggle to
accurately interpret user intentions. In contrast, our gaze-guided intent
prompting methods significantly enhance performance by integrating spatial,
temporal, and intent-related cues. We further conduct experiments on
gaze-related fine-tuning and analyze how gaze estimation accuracy impacts
prompting effectiveness. These results underscore the value of gaze for more
personalized and effective AI assistants in egocentric settings.

Abstract: Cross-View Geo-Localization (CVGL) focuses on identifying correspondences
between images captured from distinct perspectives of the same geographical
location. However, existing CVGL approaches are typically restricted to a
single view or modality, and their direct visual matching strategy lacks
interpretability: they merely predict whether two images correspond, without
explaining the rationale behind the match. In this paper, we present GLEAM-C, a
foundational CVGL model that unifies multiple views and modalities-including
UAV imagery, street maps, panoramic views, and ground photographs-by aligning
them exclusively with satellite imagery. Our framework enhances training
efficiency through optimized implementation while achieving accuracy comparable
to prior modality-specific CVGL models through a two-phase training strategy.
Moreover, to address the lack of interpretability in traditional CVGL methods,
we leverage the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) to propose a new task, GLEAM-X, which combines cross-view
correspondence prediction with explainable reasoning. To support this task, we
construct a bilingual benchmark using GPT-4o and Doubao-1.5-Thinking-Vision-Pro
to generate training and testing data. The test set is further refined through
detailed human revision, enabling systematic evaluation of explainable
cross-view reasoning and advancing transparency and scalability in
geo-localization. Together, GLEAM-C and GLEAM-X form a comprehensive CVGL
pipeline that integrates multi-modal, multi-view alignment with interpretable
correspondence analysis, unifying accurate cross-view matching with explainable
reasoning and advancing Geo-Localization by enabling models to better Explain
And Match. Code and datasets used in this work will be made publicly accessible

Conclusion: XOCT有潜力提高OCTA的可及性、可靠性和诊断价值，用于眼科疾病的检测和监测。

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) and its derived en-face
projections provide high-resolution visualization of the retinal and choroidal
vasculature, which is critical for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of retinal
diseases. However, acquiring high-quality OCTA images is challenging due to
motion sensitivity and the high costs associated with software modifications
for conventional OCT devices. Moreover, current deep learning methods for
OCT-to-OCTA translation often overlook the vascular differences across retinal
layers and struggle to reconstruct the intricate, dense vascular details
necessary for reliable diagnosis. To overcome these limitations, we propose
XOCT, a novel deep learning framework that integrates Cross-Dimensional
Supervision (CDS) with a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSFF) network for
layer-aware vascular reconstruction. Our CDS module leverages 2D layer-wise
en-face projections, generated via segmentation-weighted z-axis averaging, as
supervisory signals to compel the network to learn distinct representations for
each retinal layer through fine-grained, targeted guidance. Meanwhile, the MSFF
module enhances vessel delineation through multi-scale feature extraction
combined with a channel reweighting strategy, effectively capturing vascular
details at multiple spatial scales. Our experiments on the OCTA-500 dataset
demonstrate XOCT's improvements, especially for the en-face projections which
are significant for clinical evaluation of retinal pathologies, underscoring
its potential to enhance OCTA accessibility, reliability, and diagnostic value
for ophthalmic disease detection and monitoring. The code is available at

*Sai Siddhartha Chary Aylapuram,Veeraraju Elluru,Shivang Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Bias-Aware Machine Unlearning方法，通过选择性移除偏见样本或特征表示来减少视觉模型中的偏见，在多个数据集上显著改善了公平性指标，且准确率损失最小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在训练数据中经常依赖虚假相关性，导致在医疗和自动驾驶等安全关键领域产生有偏见或不公平的预测。传统偏见缓解方法需要从头重新训练或重新设计数据管道，而机器遗忘技术提供了一种有前景的后处理模型校正替代方案。

Method: 基于隐私保护遗忘技术，评估了多种策略包括梯度上升、LoRA和师生蒸馏方法。在三个基准数据集（CUB-200-2011的姿态偏见、CIFAR-10的合成补丁偏见、CelebA的微笑检测中的性别偏见）上进行实证分析。

Result: 后处理遗忘可以显著减少子组差异，在CUB-200上人口统计公平性改善达94.86%，CIFAR-10上30.28%，CelebA上97.37%。这些改善以最小的准确率损失实现，在效用、公平性、质量和隐私的联合评估中平均得分0.62。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明机器遗忘是一个实用的框架，可以在不需要完全重新训练的情况下增强已部署视觉系统的公平性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often rely on spurious correlations in training data,
leading to biased or unfair predictions in safety-critical domains such as
medicine and autonomous driving. While conventional bias mitigation typically
requires retraining from scratch or redesigning data pipelines, recent advances
in machine unlearning provide a promising alternative for post-hoc model
correction. In this work, we investigate \textit{Bias-Aware Machine
Unlearning}, a paradigm that selectively removes biased samples or feature
representations to mitigate diverse forms of bias in vision models. Building on
privacy-preserving unlearning techniques, we evaluate various strategies
including Gradient Ascent, LoRA, and Teacher-Student distillation. Through
empirical analysis on three benchmark datasets, CUB-200-2011 (pose bias),
CIFAR-10 (synthetic patch bias), and CelebA (gender bias in smile detection),
we demonstrate that post-hoc unlearning can substantially reduce subgroup
disparities, with improvements in demographic parity of up to \textbf{94.86\%}
on CUB-200, \textbf{30.28\%} on CIFAR-10, and \textbf{97.37\%} on CelebA. These
gains are achieved with minimal accuracy loss and with methods scoring an
average of 0.62 across the 3 settings on the joint evaluation of utility,
fairness, quality, and privacy. Our findings establish machine unlearning as a
practical framework for enhancing fairness in deployed vision systems without
necessitating full retraining.

Conclusion: ANYPORTAL提供了一个实用高效的视频内容创作和编辑解决方案，无需训练即可实现精确的视频背景替换。

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in video generation technology, creating
high-quality videos that precisely align with user intentions remains a
significant challenge. Existing methods often fail to achieve fine-grained
control over video details, limiting their practical applicability. We
introduce ANYPORTAL, a novel zero-shot framework for video background
replacement that leverages pre-trained diffusion models. Our framework
collaboratively integrates the temporal prior of video diffusion models with
the relighting capabilities of image diffusion models in a zero-shot setting.
To address the critical challenge of foreground consistency, we propose a
Refinement Projection Algorithm, which enables pixel-level detail manipulation
to ensure precise foreground preservation. ANYPORTAL is training-free and
overcomes the challenges of achieving foreground consistency and temporally
coherent relighting. Experimental results demonstrate that ANYPORTAL achieves
high-quality results on consumer-grade GPUs, offering a practical and efficient
solution for video content creation and editing.

Abstract: Deep neural networks excel in radiological image classification but
frequently suffer from poor interpretability, limiting clinical acceptance. We
present MedicalPatchNet, an inherently self-explainable architecture for chest
X-ray classification that transparently attributes decisions to distinct image
regions. MedicalPatchNet splits images into non-overlapping patches,
independently classifies each patch, and aggregates predictions, enabling
intuitive visualization of each patch's diagnostic contribution without
post-hoc techniques. Trained on the CheXpert dataset (223,414 images),
MedicalPatchNet matches the classification performance (AUROC 0.907 vs. 0.908)
of EfficientNet-B0, while substantially improving interpretability:
MedicalPatchNet demonstrates substantially improved interpretability with
higher pathology localization accuracy (mean hit-rate 0.485 vs. 0.376 with
Grad-CAM) on the CheXlocalize dataset. By providing explicit, reliable
explanations accessible even to non-AI experts, MedicalPatchNet mitigates risks
associated with shortcut learning, thus improving clinical trust. Our model is

Conclusion: 该方法成功突破了向量图形与沉硅模型之间的领域差距，为向量图形动画的自动化创作提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vector graphics, known for their scalability and user-friendliness, provide a
unique approach to visual content compared to traditional pixel-based images.
Animation of these graphics, driven by the motion of their elements, offers
enhanced comprehensibility and controllability but often requires substantial
manual effort. To automate this process, we propose a novel method that
integrates implicit neural representations with text-to-video diffusion models
for vector graphic animation. Our approach employs layered implicit neural
representations to reconstruct vector graphics, preserving their inherent
properties such as infinite resolution and precise color and shape constraints,
which effectively bridges the large domain gap between vector graphics and
diffusion models. The neural representations are then optimized using video
score distillation sampling, which leverages motion priors from pretrained
text-to-video diffusion models. Finally, the vector graphics are warped to
match the representations resulting in smooth animation. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our method in generating vivid and natural vector
graphic animations, demonstrating significant improvement over existing
techniques that suffer from limitations in flexibility and animation quality.

Result: 细调后的模型在生成方向性指令方面显著提升，充分克服了原始BLIP-2模型的限制

Conclusion: 视觉-语言模型整合接口可以有效地解决室内导航挑战，为视障人士提供可靠的导航支持，提高他们的访问性和独立性

Abstract: We address vision-language-driven indoor navigation to assist visually
impaired individuals in reaching a target location using images and natural
language guidance. Traditional navigation systems are ineffective indoors due
to the lack of precise location data. Our approach integrates vision and
language models to generate step-by-step navigational instructions, enhancing
accessibility and independence. We fine-tune the BLIP-2 model with Low Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) on a manually annotated indoor navigation dataset. We propose
an evaluation metric that refines the BERT F1 score by emphasizing directional
and sequential variables, providing a more comprehensive measure of
navigational performance. After applying LoRA, the model significantly improved
in generating directional instructions, overcoming limitations in the original
BLIP-2 model.

TL;DR: DiGS将符号距离场(SDF)学习嵌入到3D高斯分布(3DGS)流程中，通过为每个高斯基元关联可学习的SDF值来增强几何一致性，并设计几何引导的网格增长策略来改善表面重建的准确性和完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯分布虽然能实现逼真的视图合成，但由于表示的非结构化和缺乏显式几何监督，难以实现准确完整的表面重建。

Method: 提出统一框架DiGS，将SDF学习直接嵌入3DGS流程，为每个高斯基元关联可学习SDF值，并设计几何引导的多尺度网格增长策略。

Result: 在DTU、Mip-NeRF 360和Tanks&Temples等标准基准测试中，DiGS在保持高渲染保真度的同时，显著提高了重建准确性和完整性。

Conclusion: DiGS通过引入SDF学习和几何引导策略，成功解决了3DGS在表面重建方面的挑战，实现了渲染质量和几何重建的双重提升。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for
photorealistic view synthesis, representing scenes with spatially distributed
Gaussian primitives. While highly effective for rendering, achieving accurate
and complete surface reconstruction remains challenging due to the unstructured
nature of the representation and the absence of explicit geometric supervision.
In this work, we propose DiGS, a unified framework that embeds Signed Distance
Field (SDF) learning directly into the 3DGS pipeline, thereby enforcing strong
and interpretable surface priors. By associating each Gaussian with a learnable
SDF value, DiGS explicitly aligns primitives with underlying geometry and
improves cross-view consistency. To further ensure dense and coherent coverage,
we design a geometry-guided grid growth strategy that adaptively distributes
Gaussians along geometry-consistent regions under a multi-scale hierarchy.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including DTU, Mip-NeRF 360, and
Tanks& Temples, demonstrate that DiGS consistently improves reconstruction
accuracy and completeness while retaining high rendering fidelity.

Motivation: 深度神经网络容易受到伪造攻击，当前的混合策略存在破坏全局语义特征和梯度消失问题，影响伪造示例的转移性和质量。

Method: 提出三个核心技术：1)局部混合策略生成语义一致的多样化输入；2)将logit损失适配到非目标攻击场景；3)混淆扰动损失压制高频噪声。

Result: 在FGSCR-42和MTARSI两个遥感数据集上，超越了12个现有方法。在MTARSI上使用ResNet作为代理模型时，黑盒攻击成功率平均提升17.28%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过保持语义一致性和解决梯度问题，显著提高了伪造攻击的转移性能力，为遥感应用中的模型安全提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing
significant security threats to their deployment in remote sensing
applications. Research on adversarial attacks not only reveals model
vulnerabilities but also provides critical insights for enhancing robustness.
Although current mixing-based strategies have been proposed to increase the
transferability of adversarial examples, they either perform global blending or
directly exchange a region in the images, which may destroy global semantic
features and mislead the optimization of adversarial examples. Furthermore,
their reliance on cross-entropy loss for perturbation optimization leads to
gradient diminishing during iterative updates, compromising adversarial example
quality. To address these limitations, we focus on non-targeted attacks and
propose a novel framework via local mixing and logits optimization. First, we
present a local mixing strategy to generate diverse yet semantically consistent
inputs. Different from MixUp, which globally blends two images, and MixCut,
which stitches images together, our method merely blends local regions to
preserve global semantic information. Second, we adapt the logit loss from
targeted attacks to non-targeted scenarios, mitigating the gradient vanishing
problem of cross-entropy loss. Third, a perturbation smoothing loss is applied
to suppress high-frequency noise and enhance transferability. Extensive
experiments on FGSCR-42 and MTARSI datasets demonstrate superior performance
over 12 state-of-the-art methods across 6 surrogate models. Notably, with
ResNet as the surrogate on MTARSI, our method achieves a 17.28% average
improvement in black-box attack success rate.

Motivation: 3D数据标注成本高昂，而仅依赖2D框标注会引入投影模糊性，且单视角下的部分物体可见性使准确3D框估计困难

Method: 利用时序多视图聚合物体点云构建完整3D表示，采用教师-学生蒸馏：教师网络从单视角学习但目标来自时间聚合的静态物体，然后生成高质量伪标签供学生网络学习

Result: 在nuScenes和Waymo Open数据集上达到最先进的弱监督3D目标检测性能，显著缩小了与全监督方法的差距

Conclusion: MVAT框架有效解决了弱监督3D检测中的投影模糊性问题，无需任何3D框标注即可实现接近全监督方法的性能

Abstract: Annotating 3D data remains a costly bottleneck for 3D object detection,
motivating the development of weakly supervised annotation methods that rely on
more accessible 2D box annotations. However, relying solely on 2D boxes
introduces projection ambiguities since a single 2D box can correspond to
multiple valid 3D poses. Furthermore, partial object visibility under a single
viewpoint setting makes accurate 3D box estimation difficult. We propose MVAT,
a novel framework that leverages temporal multi-view present in sequential data
to address these challenges. Our approach aggregates object-centric point
clouds across time to build 3D object representations as dense and complete as
possible. A Teacher-Student distillation paradigm is employed: The Teacher
network learns from single viewpoints but targets are derived from temporally
aggregated static objects. Then the Teacher generates high quality
pseudo-labels that the Student learns to predict from a single viewpoint for
both static and moving objects. The whole framework incorporates a multi-view
2D projection loss to enforce consistency between predicted 3D boxes and all
available 2D annotations. Experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate that MVAT achieves state-of-the-art performance for weakly
supervised 3D object detection, significantly narrowing the gap with fully
supervised methods without requiring any 3D box annotations. % \footnote{Code

Abstract: Hand gesture understanding is essential for several applications in
human-computer interaction, including automatic clinical assessment of hand
dexterity. While deep learning has advanced static gesture recognition, dynamic
gesture understanding remains challenging due to complex spatiotemporal
variations. Moreover, existing datasets often lack multimodal and multi-view
diversity, precise ground-truth tracking, and an action quality component
embedded within gestures. This paper introduces EHWGesture, a multimodal video
dataset for gesture understanding featuring five clinically relevant gestures.
It includes over 1,100 recordings (6 hours), captured from 25 healthy subjects
using two high-resolution RGB-Depth cameras and an event camera. A motion
capture system provides precise ground-truth hand landmark tracking, and all
devices are spatially calibrated and synchronized to ensure cross-modal
alignment. Moreover, to embed an action quality task within gesture
understanding, collected recordings are organized in classes of execution speed
that mirror clinical evaluations of hand dexterity. Baseline experiments
highlight the dataset's potential for gesture classification, gesture trigger
detection, and action quality assessment. Thus, EHWGesture can serve as a
comprehensive benchmark for advancing multimodal clinical gesture
understanding.

Conclusion: UFC是一个通用且高效的少样本控制适配器，能够快速适应各种新空间控制任务，适用于不同的扩散模型架构（UNet和DiT）。

Abstract: Spatial conditioning in pretrained text-to-image diffusion models has
significantly improved fine-grained control over the structure of generated
images. However, existing control adapters exhibit limited adaptability and
incur high training costs when encountering novel spatial control conditions
that differ substantially from the training tasks. To address this limitation,
we propose Universal Few-Shot Control (UFC), a versatile few-shot control
adapter capable of generalizing to novel spatial conditions. Given a few
image-condition pairs of an unseen task and a query condition, UFC leverages
the analogy between query and support conditions to construct task-specific
control features, instantiated by a matching mechanism and an update on a small
set of task-specific parameters. Experiments on six novel spatial control tasks
show that UFC, fine-tuned with only 30 annotated examples of novel tasks,
achieves fine-grained control consistent with the spatial conditions. Notably,
when fine-tuned with 0.1% of the full training data, UFC achieves competitive
performance with the fully supervised baselines in various control tasks. We
also show that UFC is applicable agnostically to various diffusion backbones
and demonstrate its effectiveness on both UNet and DiT architectures. Code is

Motivation: 传统的随机遮罩策略在3D医学图像中忽视了解剖结构密度的重要性，导致Masked Image Modeling在医学图像计算中的应用受限。

Method: 提出基于Hounsfield Unit(HU)测量的前景遮罩策略，根据内臟器官的强度分布重点遮罩有意义的解剖结构，排除空气、液体等无诊断价值的非组织区域。

Result: 在5个公开3D医学图像数据集(BTCV、Flare22、MM-WHS、Amos22、BraTS)上均实现了性能提升，Dice分数分别达到了84.64%、92.43%、90.67%、88.64%和78.55%。

Conclusion: 领域中心的MIM策略对医学图像表征学习致关重要，为医学图像分割提供了有前景的研究方向。

Abstract: While Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has revolutionized fields of computer
vision, its adoption in 3D medical image computing has been limited by the use
of random masking, which overlooks the density of anatomical objects. To
address this limitation, we enhance the pretext task with a simple yet
effective masking strategy. Leveraging Hounsfield Unit (HU) measurements, we
implement an HU-based Foreground Masking, which focuses on the intensity
distribution of visceral organs and excludes non-tissue regions, such as air
and fluid, that lack diagnostically meaningful features. Extensive experiments
on five public 3D medical imaging datasets demonstrate that our masking
consistently improves performance, both in quality of segmentation and Dice
score (BTCV:~84.64\%, Flare22:~92.43\%, MM-WHS:~90.67\%, Amos22:~88.64\%,
BraTS:~78.55\%). These results underscore the importance of domain-centric MIM

Abstract: Document images encapsulate a wealth of knowledge, while the portability of

prior work has explored knowledge base question answering over visual document
images with queries provided directly in speech. We propose TextlessRAG, the

Conclusion: 该前向传播框架能够高效地从单张无姿态图像生成高质量的3D头部模型，为快速3D重建提供了一种新的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a feed-forward framework for Gaussian full-head synthesis from a
single unposed image. Unlike previous work that relies on time-consuming GAN
inversion and test-time optimization, our framework can reconstruct the
Gaussian full-head model given a single unposed image in a single forward pass.
This enables fast reconstruction and rendering during inference. To mitigate
the lack of large-scale 3D head assets, we propose a large-scale synthetic
dataset from trained 3D GANs and train our framework using only synthetic data.
For efficient high-fidelity generation, we introduce a coarse-to-fine Gaussian
head generation pipeline, where sparse points from the FLAME model interact
with the image features by transformer blocks for feature extraction and coarse
shape reconstruction, which are then densified for high-fidelity
reconstruction. To fully leverage the prior knowledge residing in pretrained 3D
GANs for effective reconstruction, we propose a dual-branch framework that
effectively aggregates the structured spherical triplane feature and
unstructured point-based features for more effective Gaussian head
reconstruction. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our framework
towards existing work.

Abstract: Visual reasoning over structured data such as tables is a critical capability
for modern vision-language models (VLMs), yet current benchmarks remain limited
in scale, diversity, or reasoning depth, especially when it comes to rendered
table images. Addressing this gap, we introduce Visual-TableQA, a large-scale,
open-domain multimodal dataset specifically designed to evaluate and enhance
visual reasoning over complex tabular data. Our generation pipeline is modular,
scalable, and fully autonomous, involving multiple reasoning LLMs collaborating
across distinct roles: generation, validation, and inspiration. Visual-TableQA
comprises 2.5k richly structured LaTeX-rendered tables and 6k
reasoning-intensive QA pairs, all produced at a cost of under USD 100. To
promote diversity and creativity, our pipeline performs multi-model
collaborative data generation via cross-model prompting ('inspiration') and
LLM-jury filtering. Stronger models seed layouts and topics that weaker models
elaborate, collectively distilling diverse reasoning patterns and visual
structures into the dataset. Empirical results show that models fine-tuned on
Visual-TableQA generalize robustly to external benchmarks, outperforming
several proprietary models despite the dataset's synthetic nature. The full
pipeline and resources are publicly available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了Class Node Graph Attention Network (CGAT)架构，通过图注意力机制和可视化解释来解决3D形状识别中的黑盒问题，在牙齿发育阶段分类任务中取得了良好性能并提供了可解释的注意力图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在黑盒性质限制了其在高风险应用中的采用，特别是在需要信任和问责制的医疗和法医领域。本文旨在解决3D形状识别任务中的可解释性问题。

Method: 提出CGAT架构，使用图注意力卷积和注意力机制，通过注意力rollout可视化决策过程。评估了局部平均曲率和质心距离节点特征的不同组合以及模型深度。

Result: 结合局部平均曲率和质心距离作为节点特征获得了0.76加权F1分数，性能略有提升，并产生了更全面的注意力可视化。包含指向全局CLS节点的有向边的模型产生了更直观的注意力图。

Conclusion: CGAT架构能够生成人类可理解的注意力图，增强信任并促进专家验证模型决策。虽然应用于牙科数据，但CGAT广泛适用于基于图的分类和回归任务，促进透明深度学习模型在高风险环境中的更广泛采用。

Abstract: Deep learning offers a promising avenue for automating many recognition tasks
in fields such as medicine and forensics. However, the black-box nature of
these models hinders their adoption in high-stakes applications where trust and
accountability are required. For 3D shape recognition tasks in particular, this
paper introduces the Class Node Graph Attention Network (CGAT) architecture to
address this need. Applied to 3D meshes of third molars derived from CBCT
images, for Demirjian stage allocation, CGAT utilizes graph attention
convolutions and an inherent attention mechanism, visualized via attention
rollout, to explain its decision-making process. We evaluated the local mean
curvature and distance to centroid node features, both individually and in
combination, as well as model depth, finding that models incorporating directed
edges to a global CLS node produced more intuitive attention maps, while also
yielding desirable classification performance. We analyzed the attention-based
explanations of the models, and their predictive performances to propose
optimal settings for the CGAT. The combination of local mean curvature and
distance to centroid as node features yielded a slight performance increase
with 0.76 weighted F1 score, and more comprehensive attention visualizations.
The CGAT architecture's ability to generate human-understandable attention maps
can enhance trust and facilitate expert validation of model decisions. While
demonstrated on dental data, CGAT is broadly applicable to graph-based
classification and regression tasks, promoting wider adoption of transparent
and competitive deep learning models in high-stakes environments.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源多模态模型在视觉问题中存在理论单调、交互轮次限制等问题，无法满足需要多次试错探索的复杂视觉搜索任务。

Method: 构建Visual Probe数据集，连续数据收集流水线获取多样化理论路径，采用超轮掩码策略防止劳动力学习中过轮响应被惩罚，从而在训练时仅使用6轮上限却能在推理时扩展到数十轮。

Result: 模型在具有挑战性的视觉搜索任务上达到了最先进的性能，产生了丰富的理论模式和深度思考路径，准确性随着交互轮次的增加而提升。

Conclusion: 通过扩大工具基交互规模和深度多轮理解，Mini-o3系统成功解决了复杂视觉搜索问题，为大型多模态模型的探索性理解提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large multimodal models have leveraged image-based tools
with reinforcement learning to tackle visual problems. However, existing
open-source approaches often exhibit monotonous reasoning patterns and allow
only a limited number of interaction turns, making them inadequate for
difficult tasks that require trial-and-error exploration. In this work, we
address this limitation by scaling up tool-based interactions and introduce
Mini-o3, a system that executes deep, multi-turn reasoning -- spanning tens of
steps -- and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging visual search
tasks. Our recipe for reproducing OpenAI o3-style behaviors comprises three key
components. First, we construct the Visual Probe Dataset, a collection of
thousands of challenging visual search problems designed for exploratory
reasoning. Second, we develop an iterative data collection pipeline to obtain
cold-start trajectories that exhibit diverse reasoning patterns, including
depth-first search, trial-and-error, and goal maintenance. Third, we propose an
over-turn masking strategy that prevents penalization of over-turn responses
(those that hit the maximum number of turns) during reinforcement learning,
thereby balancing training-time efficiency with test-time scalability. Despite
training with an upper bound of only six interaction turns, our model generates
trajectories that naturally scale to tens of turns at inference time, with
accuracy improving as the number of turns increases. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Mini-o3 produces rich reasoning patterns and deep thinking
paths, effectively solving challenging visual search problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时序图像取证是通过分析图像采集过程中引入的时间依赖性痕迹来估计数字图像年龄的科学。本文旨在全面综述该领域，验证已知年龄痕迹的特性，并揭示现有方法可能存在的问题（如内容偏差）

Method: 采用文献综述、实验验证和重新实现的方法：分析前人工作、验证传感器缺陷的主要特性（生长速率和空间分布）、研究神经网络学习特征、展示神经网络易受干扰的问题

Result: 发现利用传感器缺陷进行图像年龄近似的方法实际上可能利用了其他痕迹（很可能是内容偏差）；验证了传感器缺陷的生长速率和空间分布特性；展示了神经网络容易被分散注意力而无法学习年龄痕迹

Conclusion: 内容偏差是时序图像取证中的重要问题，可解释人工智能方法对于验证时序图像取证技术的可靠性至关重要；提出了更现实的取证设置，为未来研究提供了重要指导

Abstract: Temporal image forensics is the science of estimating the age of a digital
image. Usually, time-dependent traces (age traces) introduced by the image
acquisition pipeline are exploited for this purpose. In this review, a
comprehensive overview of the field of temporal image forensics based on
time-dependent traces from the image acquisition pipeline is given. This
includes a detailed insight into the properties of known age traces (i.e.,
in-field sensor defects and sensor dust) and temporal image forensics
techniques. Another key aspect of this work is to highlight the problem of
content bias and to illustrate how important eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence methods are to verify the reliability of temporal image forensics
techniques. Apart from reviewing material presented in previous works, in this
review: (i) a new (probably more realistic) forensic setting is proposed; (ii)
the main properties (growth rate and spatial distribution) of in-field sensor
defects are verified; (iii) it is shown that a method proposed to utilize
in-field sensor defects for image age approximation actually exploits other
traces (most likely content bias); (iv) the features learned by a neural
network dating palmprint images are further investigated; (v) it is shown how
easily a neural network can be distracted from learning age traces. For this
purpose, previous work is analyzed, re-implemented if required and experiments
are conducted.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉语言基础模型中的性别偏见评估存在严重问题，即使对非性别特征进行微小扰动（如遮挡10%物体或轻微模糊背景），也会导致偏见评分发生显著变化，表明当前评估方法主要反映模型对虚假特征而非真实性别偏见的响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于真实图像的性别偏见评估基准往往包含性别与非性别特征（如物体和背景）之间的虚假相关性，这可能导致性别偏见评估失真，需要研究这些虚假特征对评估结果的影响程度。

Method: 系统性地扰动四个广泛使用的基准（COCO-gender、FACET、MIAP和PHASE）中的非性别特征，并量化这些扰动对各种视觉语言模型偏见评估的影响。

Result: 即使最小程度的扰动（如遮挡10%物体或弱模糊背景）也能显著改变偏见评分，生成式视觉语言模型的指标变化高达175%，CLIP变体变化达43%，表明当前偏见评估主要反映模型对虚假特征的响应。

Conclusion: 由于创建无虚假特征的基准具有根本性挑战，建议在报告偏见指标时同时报告特征敏感性测量，以实现更可靠的偏见评估。

Abstract: Gender bias in vision-language foundation models (VLMs) raises concerns about
their safe deployment and is typically evaluated using benchmarks with gender
annotations on real-world images. However, as these benchmarks often contain
spurious correlations between gender and non-gender features, such as objects
and backgrounds, we identify a critical oversight in gender bias evaluation: Do
spurious features distort gender bias evaluation? To address this question, we
systematically perturb non-gender features across four widely used benchmarks
(COCO-gender, FACET, MIAP, and PHASE) and various VLMs to quantify their impact
on bias evaluation. Our findings reveal that even minimal perturbations, such
as masking just 10% of objects or weakly blurring backgrounds, can dramatically
alter bias scores, shifting metrics by up to 175% in generative VLMs and 43% in
CLIP variants. This suggests that current bias evaluations often reflect model
responses to spurious features rather than gender bias, undermining their
reliability. Since creating spurious feature-free benchmarks is fundamentally
challenging, we recommend reporting bias metrics alongside feature-sensitivity
measurements to enable a more reliable bias assessment.

Motivation: 解决现有医疗视觉-语言模型对病人元数据利用不充分、缺乏临床诊断知识集成以及在3D医学形态形成效果有限的问题。

Method: 提出两项关键创新：1）将结构化元数据转换为合成报告以丰富文本输入；2）添加预测小精神状态检查(MMSE)分数的辅助标记，为精调提供额外监督。采用轻量级提示调整技术。

Result: 在仅使用1,500张训练图像的情况下，在两个阿尔茬海病数据集上达到了最先进性能，超过了需要10,000张图像进行精调的现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过创新地利用元数据和临床指标，实现了数据高效的3D医学形态诊断，为医疗视觉-语言模型的应用提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (Med-VLMs) have shown impressive results in
tasks such as report generation and visual question answering, but they still
face several limitations. Most notably, they underutilize patient metadata and
lack integration of clinical diagnostic knowledge. Moreover, most existing
models are typically trained from scratch or fine-tuned on large-scale 2D
image-text pairs, requiring extensive computational resources, and their
effectiveness on 3D medical imaging is often limited due to the absence of
structural information. To address these gaps, we propose a data-efficient
fine-tuning pipeline to adapt 3D CT-based Med-VLMs for 3D MRI and demonstrate
its application in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. Our system introduces
two key innovations. First, we convert structured metadata into synthetic
reports, enriching textual input for improved image-text alignment. Second, we
add an auxiliary token trained to predict the mini-mental state examination
(MMSE) score, a widely used clinical measure of cognitive function that
correlates with AD severity. This provides additional supervision for
fine-tuning. Applying lightweight prompt tuning to both image and text
modalities, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on two AD
datasets using 1,500 training images, outperforming existing methods fine-tuned
on 10,000 images. Code will be released upon publication.

Result: 在ADNI数据集上实现了更高的分类准确性和改进的可解释性，并在OASIS数据集上显示出强大的零样本通用性，在PPMI数据集上显示出跨任务通用性

Conclusion: 该方法有效地解决了标签数据依赖和可解释性问题，为神经退行性疾病的诊断提供了更准确和可解释的解决方案

Abstract: Deep learning has shown significant potential in diagnosing neurodegenerative
diseases from MRI data. However, most existing methods rely heavily on large
volumes of labeled data and often yield representations that lack
interpretability. To address both challenges, we propose a novel
self-supervised cross-encoder framework that leverages the temporal continuity
in longitudinal MRI scans for supervision. This framework disentangles learned
representations into two components: a static representation, constrained by
contrastive learning, which captures stable anatomical features; and a dynamic
representation, guided by input-gradient regularization, which reflects
temporal changes and can be effectively fine-tuned for downstream
classification tasks. Experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our method achieves
superior classification accuracy and improved interpretability. Furthermore,
the learned representations exhibit strong zero-shot generalization on the Open
Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset and cross-task generalization
on the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) dataset. The code for the
proposed method will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 解决语义水印技术在重生攻击下频富整体性损失导致检测性能下降的问题，以及裁剪攻击导致的脏强性问题。

Method: 提出Hermitian对称频富水印技术（SFW），通过强制Hermitian对称保持频富整体性；重点嵌入策略减少裁剪攻击影响；应用于现有语义水印方案以提升脏强性。

Result: 在各种攻击场景下达到最佳验证和识别性能，检测准确率最高且图像保真度优异（FID和CLIP指标验证）。

Conclusion: SFW是一个有效的框架，能够在脏强性和图像保真度之间得到良好平衡，解决了语义水印中的内在批扭问题。

Abstract: Semantic watermarking techniques for latent diffusion models (LDMs) are
robust against regeneration attacks, but often suffer from detection
performance degradation due to the loss of frequency integrity. To tackle this
problem, we propose a novel embedding method called Hermitian Symmetric Fourier
Watermarking (SFW), which maintains frequency integrity by enforcing Hermitian
symmetry. Additionally, we introduce a center-aware embedding strategy that
reduces the vulnerability of semantic watermarking due to cropping attacks by
ensuring robust information retention. To validate our approach, we apply these
techniques to existing semantic watermarking schemes, enhancing their
frequency-domain structures for better robustness and retrieval accuracy.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art
verification and identification performance, surpassing previous approaches
across various attack scenarios. Ablation studies confirm the impact of SFW on
detection capabilities, the effectiveness of the center-aware embedding against
cropping, and how message capacity influences identification accuracy. Notably,
our method achieves the highest detection accuracy while maintaining superior
image fidelity, as evidenced by FID and CLIP scores. Conclusively, our proposed
SFW is shown to be an effective framework for balancing robustness and image
fidelity, addressing the inherent trade-offs in semantic watermarking. Code

Conclusion: 该方法既有效又具有通用性，证明了通过张量低秩背景建模和小目标稀疏分解的深度学习框架的优越性

Abstract: Small moving target detection is crucial for many defense applications but
remains highly challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios, ambiguous visual
cues, and cluttered backgrounds. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning
framework that differs fundamentally from existing approaches, which often rely
on target-specific features or motion cues and tend to lack robustness in
complex environments. Our key insight is that small target detection and
background discrimination are inherently coupled, even cluttered video
backgrounds often exhibit strong low-rank structures that can serve as stable
priors for detection. We reformulate the task as a tensor-based low-rank and
sparse decomposition problem and conduct a theoretical analysis of the
background, target, and noise components to guide model design. Building on
these insights, we introduce TenRPCANet, a deep neural network that requires
minimal assumptions about target characteristics. Specifically, we propose a
tokenization strategy that implicitly enforces multi-order tensor low-rank
priors through a self-attention mechanism. This mechanism captures both local
and non-local self-similarity to model the low-rank background without relying
on explicit iterative optimization. In addition, inspired by the sparse
component update in tensor RPCA, we design a feature refinement module to
enhance target saliency. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on two highly distinct and challenging tasks: multi-frame infrared
small target detection and space object detection. These results demonstrate
both the effectiveness and the generalizability of our approach.

Motivation: 现有的单应性、多网格单应性或薄板样条等深度图像配准方法在处理包含深度差异的真实场景时存在固有局限性，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 提出EDFFDNet网络，采用指数衰减基函数的自由形变设计；引入自适应稀疏运动聚合器(ASMA)替代MLP运动聚合器；提出渐进相关细化策略，利用全局-局部相关模式进行从粗到细的运动估计。

Result: EDFFDNet将参数、内存和总运行时间分别减少了70.5%、32.6%和33.7%，同时PSNR比最先进方法提高了0.5 dB。EDFFDNet-2进一步将PSNR提高了1.06 dB，同时保持较低计算成本。

Conclusion: 该方法在处理深度差异场景方面表现出色，具有更强的泛化能力，在多个数据集上都优于之前的深度学习方法，实现了效率与精度的双重提升。

Abstract: Previous deep image registration methods that employ single homography,
multi-grid homography, or thin-plate spline often struggle with real scenes
containing depth disparities due to their inherent limitations. To address
this, we propose an Exponential-Decay Free-Form Deformation Network (EDFFDNet),
which employs free-form deformation with an exponential-decay basis function.
This design achieves higher efficiency and performs well in scenes with depth
disparities, benefiting from its inherent locality. We also introduce an
Adaptive Sparse Motion Aggregator (ASMA), which replaces the MLP motion
aggregator used in previous methods. By transforming dense interactions into
sparse ones, ASMA reduces parameters and improves accuracy. Additionally, we
propose a progressive correlation refinement strategy that leverages
global-local correlation patterns for coarse-to-fine motion estimation, further
enhancing efficiency and accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that EDFFDNet
reduces parameters, memory, and total runtime by 70.5%, 32.6%, and 33.7%,
respectively, while achieving a 0.5 dB PSNR gain over the state-of-the-art
method. With an additional local refinement stage,EDFFDNet-2 further improves
PSNR by 1.06 dB while maintaining lower computational costs. Our method also
demonstrates strong generalization ability across datasets, outperforming
previous deep learning methods.

Motivation: 深度神经网络在图像分类中表现优异，但容易受到对抗示例的攻击。标准对抗训练虽能提升稳健性，但常忽略了类间特征重叠这一重要因素。

Method: 提出了一种新的对抗训练框架，通过在特征空间中抑制对抗样本和清洁样本的类间依赖性来主动减少类间近似性。具体包括识别每个对抗样本的最近类间邻居，然后移除在这些邻居上的投影以强化特征可分离性。

Conclusion: 明确处理类间特征近似性对提升深度神经网络的对抗稳健性至关重要，本研究为进一步提高模型稳健性提供了新的视角和方法。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have exhibited impressive performance in image
classification tasks but remain vulnerable to adversarial examples. Standard
adversarial training enhances robustness but typically fails to explicitly
address inter-class feature overlap, a significant contributor to adversarial
susceptibility. In this work, we introduce a novel adversarial training
framework that actively mitigates inter-class proximity by projecting out
inter-class dependencies from adversarial and clean samples in the feature
space. Specifically, our approach first identifies the nearest inter-class
neighbors for each adversarial sample and subsequently removes projections onto
these neighbors to enforce stronger feature separability. Theoretically, we
demonstrate that our proposed logits correction reduces the Lipschitz constant
of neural networks, thereby lowering the Rademacher complexity, which directly
contributes to improved generalization and robustness. Extensive experiments
across standard benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN show that
our method demonstrates strong performance that is competitive with leading
adversarial training techniques, highlighting significant achievements in both
robust and clean accuracy. Our findings reveal the importance of addressing
inter-class feature proximity explicitly to bolster adversarial robustness in
DNNs.

Abstract: Video understanding has seen significant progress in recent years, with
models' performance on perception from short clips continuing to rise. Yet,
multiple recent benchmarks, such as LVBench, Neptune, and ActivityNet-RTL, show
performance wanes for tasks requiring complex reasoning on videos as queries
grow more complex and videos grow longer. In this work, we ask: can existing
perception capabilities be leveraged to successfully perform more complex video
reasoning? In particular, we develop a large language model agent given access
to video modules as subagents or tools. Rather than following a fixed procedure
to solve queries as in previous work such as Visual Programming, ViperGPT, and
MoReVQA, the agent uses the results of each call to a module to determine
subsequent steps. Inspired by work in the textual reasoning domain, we
introduce a critic to distinguish between instances of successful and
unsuccessful sequences from the agent. We show that the combination of our
agent and critic achieve strong performance on the previously-mentioned
datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统学习方法使用单一熵模型估计整个图像的概率分布，无法有效捕捉不同语义区域的多样化统计特征

Method: 利用语义分割识别不同区域并为每个区域分配专用熵模型，使用多通道离散逻辑混合似然建模像素值分布

Conclusion: SEEC框架通过语义分割指导的多熵模型选择，显著提升了无损图像压缩性能，为不同语义区域提供更准确的概率分布估计

Abstract: Recently, learned image compression has attracted considerable attention due
to its superior performance over traditional methods. However, most existing
approaches employ a single entropy model to estimate the probability
distribution of pixel values across the entire image, which limits their
ability to capture the diverse statistical characteristics of different
semantic regions. To overcome this limitation, we propose Segmentation-Assisted
Multi-Entropy Models for Lossless Image Compression (SEEC). Our framework
utilizes semantic segmentation to guide the selection and adaptation of
multiple entropy models, enabling more accurate probability distribution
estimation for distinct semantic regions. Specifically, SEEC first extracts
image features and then applies semantic segmentation to identify different
regions, each assigned a specialized entropy model to better capture its unique
statistical properties. Finally, a multi-channel discrete logistic mixture
likelihood is employed to model the pixel value distributions effectively.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEEC achieves

TL;DR: 通过多模态深度学习模型，结合CTA图像和临床数据，提前识别中风复发风险患者，为临床治疗提供支持


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中风是全球第二大死因，复发率高且死亡率极高（40%），通过早期识别高风险患者来降低复发率

Method: 收集3D脱内CTA图像数据和临床数据（心脏疾病、年龄、性别），训练单模态和多模态深度学习模型，进行二类分类（任务1）和生存分析（任务2）

Result: 单模态表格数据在任务1达到AUC 0.84；多模态模型在任务2达到c-index 0.68和AUC 0.71，视觉数据占比0.68权重，表格数据占比0.32

Conclusion: 心脏疾病（表格数据）和颈动脉（图像数据）在中风复发预测中具有重要关联，多模态模型能够提供更准确的预测结果

Abstract: Stroke is the second most frequent cause of death world wide with an annual
mortality of around 5.5 million. Recurrence rates of stroke are between 5 and
25% in the first year. As mortality rates for relapses are extraordinarily high
(40%) it is of utmost importance to reduce the recurrence rates. We address
this issue by detecting patients at risk of stroke recurrence at an early stage
in order to enable appropriate therapy planning. To this end we collected 3D
intracranial CTA image data and recorded concomitant heart diseases, the age
and the gender of stroke patients between 2010 and 2024. We trained single- and
multimodal deep learning based neural networks for binary relapse detection
(Task 1) and for relapse free survival (RFS) time prediction together with a
subsequent classification (Task 2). The separation of relapse from non-relapse
patients (Task 1) could be solved with tabular data (AUC on test dataset:
0.84). However, for the main task, the regression (Task 2), our multimodal
XSRD-net processed the modalities vision:tabular with 0.68:0.32 according to
modality contribution measures. The c-index with respect to relapses for the
multimodal model reached 0.68, and the AUC is 0.71 for the test dataset. Final,
deeper interpretability analysis results could highlight a link between both
heart diseases (tabular) and carotid arteries (vision) for the detection of
relapses and the prediction of the RFS time. This is a central outcome that we
strive to strengthen with ongoing data collection and model retraining.

<details>

Motivation: 虚拟现实和数字人建模应用对头发重建的需求日益增长，现有方法往往忽视发丝的连接性和拓扑结构

Method: 多阶段管道：首先使用可微分高斯光栅化器重建详细几何，然后通过新颖的合并方案将高斯段合并为连贯发丝，最后在光度监督下细化和生长发丝

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证了方法对多种发型的鲁棒性，重建通常在1小时内完成

Conclusion: 该方法成功扩展了3DGS框架，实现了发丝级的头发重建，并提出了评估拓扑准确性的新指标

Abstract: Human hair reconstruction is a challenging problem in computer vision, with
growing importance for applications in virtual reality and digital human
modeling. Recent advances in 3D Gaussians Splatting (3DGS) provide efficient
and explicit scene representations that naturally align with the structure of
hair strands. In this work, we extend the 3DGS framework to enable strand-level
hair geometry reconstruction from multi-view images. Our multi-stage pipeline
first reconstructs detailed hair geometry using a differentiable Gaussian
rasterizer, then merges individual Gaussian segments into coherent strands
through a novel merging scheme, and finally refines and grows the strands under
photometric supervision.
  While existing methods typically evaluate reconstruction quality at the
geometric level, they often neglect the connectivity and topology of hair
strands. To address this, we propose a new evaluation metric that serves as a
proxy for assessing topological accuracy in strand reconstruction. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method robustly handles a wide range of hairstyles and achieves efficient
reconstruction, typically completing within one hour.

Motivation: RayGauss在合成和室内场景中实现了最先进的渲染质量，但其计算成本阻碍了在真实世界场景中的实时渲染

Method: 引入体积渲染加速策略（空空间跳过和自适应采样）、增强光线连贯性、尺度正则化减少误报交集、新的致密化标准改善远距离区域密度分布

Result: 在真实世界数据集上实现5-12倍训练加速、50-80倍渲染速度提升（FPS），视觉质量提升高达+0.56 dB PSNR

Conclusion: RayGaussX成功解决了RayGauss的计算效率问题，在保持高质量的同时实现了显著的性能提升，适用于大规模真实场景的实时渲染

Abstract: RayGauss has achieved state-of-the-art rendering quality for novel-view
synthesis on synthetic and indoor scenes by representing radiance and density
fields with irregularly distributed elliptical basis functions, rendered via
volume ray casting using a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH). However, its
computational cost prevents real-time rendering on real-world scenes. Our
approach, RayGaussX, builds on RayGauss by introducing key contributions that
accelerate both training and inference. Specifically, we incorporate volumetric
rendering acceleration strategies such as empty-space skipping and adaptive
sampling, enhance ray coherence, and introduce scale regularization to reduce
false-positive intersections. Additionally, we propose a new densification
criterion that improves density distribution in distant regions, leading to
enhanced graphical quality on larger scenes. As a result, RayGaussX achieves 5x
to 12x faster training and 50x to 80x higher rendering speeds (FPS) on
real-world datasets while improving visual quality by up to +0.56 dB in PSNR.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的自监督学习方法，用于融合两个正交各异性低分辨率磁共振成像，以重建统一表示的解剖细节，无需高分辨率数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学磁共振成像中，平衡图像质量与扫描时间和患者舒适性是一大挑战。传统方法需要医生单独分析多个低分辨率扫描，时间消耗大且容易导致误判。

Method: 设计了一种多视角神经网络，采用自监督学习方式训练，无需高分辨率数据。引入稀疏坐标基损失函数，支持任意缩放比例的低分辨率图像融合。组合了患者无关的离线阶段和患者特從的在线阶段。

Result: 在两个独立的磁共振图像数据集上评估，与目前最优的自监督超分辨率方法相比，在不同的上采样缩放比例下表现相似或更优。患者特從重建速度提升达10倍，保持相同或更好的超分辨率质量。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在不依赖高分辨率数据的情况下，通过融合多个低分辨率扫描来重建高质量的解剖细节，显著提高了重建效率而不丢失质量，为医学形态学分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Acquiring images in high resolution is often a challenging task. Especially
in the medical sector, image quality has to be balanced with acquisition time
and patient comfort. To strike a compromise between scan time and quality for
Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging, two anisotropic scans with different
low-resolution (LR) orientations can be acquired. Typically, LR scans are
analyzed individually by radiologists, which is time consuming and can lead to
inaccurate interpretation. To tackle this, we propose a novel approach for
fusing two orthogonal anisotropic LR MR images to reconstruct anatomical
details in a unified representation. Our multi-view neural network is trained
in a self-supervised manner, without requiring corresponding high-resolution
(HR) data. To optimize the model, we introduce a sparse coordinate-based loss,
enabling the integration of LR images with arbitrary scaling. We evaluate our
method on MR images from two independent cohorts. Our results demonstrate
comparable or even improved super-resolution (SR) performance compared to
state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised SR methods for different upsampling
scales. By combining a patient-agnostic offline and a patient-specific online
phase, we achieve a substantial speed-up of up to ten times for
patient-specific reconstruction while achieving similar or better SR quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SplatFill是一种新颖的深度引导3D高斯溅射场景修复方法，通过联合深度监督和一致性感知细化，实现了最先进的感知质量和更高的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯溅射(3DGS)虽然能从多视角图像创建高度逼真的3D场景表示，但对缺失区域（遮挡或场景编辑导致）的修复仍然具有挑战性，通常会导致模糊细节、伪影和几何不一致。

Method: 结合两个关键思想：(1)联合深度基和对象基监督，确保修复的高斯在3D空间中准确定位并与周围几何对齐；(2)提出一致性感知细化方案，选择性识别和纠正不一致区域而不破坏场景其余部分。

Result: 在SPIn-NeRF数据集上的评估表明，SplatFill不仅在视觉保真度上超越了现有的基于NeRF和3DGS的修复方法，还将训练时间减少了24.5%。定性结果显示该方法能提供更清晰的细节、更少的伪影，并在具有挑战性的视角下具有更好的一致性。

Conclusion: SplatFill通过深度引导和一致性感知细化，成功解决了3DGS场景修复中的关键挑战，实现了高质量的修复效果和显著的效率提升。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled the creation of highly realistic 3D
scene representations from sets of multi-view images. However, inpainting
missing regions, whether due to occlusion or scene editing, remains a
challenging task, often leading to blurry details, artifacts, and inconsistent
geometry. In this work, we introduce SplatFill, a novel depth-guided approach
for 3DGS scene inpainting that achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality and
improved efficiency. Our method combines two key ideas: (1) joint depth-based
and object-based supervision to ensure inpainted Gaussians are accurately
placed in 3D space and aligned with surrounding geometry, and (2) we propose a
consistency-aware refinement scheme that selectively identifies and corrects
inconsistent regions without disrupting the rest of the scene. Evaluations on
the SPIn-NeRF dataset demonstrate that SplatFill not only surpasses existing
NeRF-based and 3DGS-based inpainting methods in visual fidelity but also
reduces training time by 24.5%. Qualitative results show our method delivers
sharper details, fewer artifacts, and greater coherence across challenging
viewpoints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的3D分割方法存在表示不对齐问题：输入阶段需要繁重的预对齐，输出阶段缺乏显式几何线索，导致语义混淆和细粒度精度损失

Method: 提出Point Linguist Model (PLM)框架，包含Object-centric Discriminative Representation (OcDR)学习对象中心token，以及Geometric Reactivation Decoder (GRD)结合LLM推理的几何信息和密集特征进行分割

Result: 在ScanNetv2上提升7.3 mIoU，在Multi3DRefer上提升6.0 mIoU，在7个基准测试的4个不同任务中均取得一致性能提升

Conclusion: PLM通过全面的对象中心推理实现了鲁棒的3D理解，有效解决了LLM与3D点云之间的表示对齐问题

Abstract: 3D object segmentation with Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a
prevailing paradigm due to its broad semantics, task flexibility, and strong
generalization. However, this paradigm is hindered by representation
misalignment: LLMs process high-level semantic tokens, whereas 3D point clouds
convey only dense geometric structures. In prior methods, misalignment limits
both input and output. At the input stage, dense point patches require heavy
pre-alignment, weakening object-level semantics and confusing similar
distractors. At the output stage, predictions depend only on dense features
without explicit geometric cues, leading to a loss of fine-grained accuracy. To
address these limitations, we present the Point Linguist Model (PLM), a general
framework that bridges the representation gap between LLMs and dense 3D point
clouds without requiring large-scale pre-alignment between 3D-text or
3D-images. Specifically, we introduce Object-centric Discriminative
Representation (OcDR), which learns object-centric tokens that capture target
semantics and scene relations under a hard negative-aware training objective.
This mitigates the misalignment between LLM tokens and 3D points, enhances
resilience to distractors, and facilitates semantic-level reasoning within
LLMs. For accurate segmentation, we introduce the Geometric Reactivation
Decoder (GRD), which predicts masks by combining OcDR tokens carrying
LLM-inferred geometry with corresponding dense features, preserving
comprehensive dense features throughout the pipeline. Extensive experiments
show that PLM achieves significant improvements of +7.3 mIoU on ScanNetv2 and
+6.0 mIoU on Multi3DRefer for 3D referring segmentation, with consistent gains
across 7 benchmarks spanning 4 different tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness
of comprehensive object-centric reasoning for robust 3D understanding.

presents a novel approach to automated burned area mapping using the AlphaEArth
dataset combined with the Siamese U-Net deep learning architecture. The
AlphaEArth Dataset, comprising high-resolution optical and thermal infrared

demonstrate that the proposed ensemble approach achieves superior performance
with an overall accuracy of 95%, IoU of 0.6, and F1-score of 74% on the test
dataset. The model successfully identifies burned areas across diverse
ecosystems with complex background, showing particular strength in detecting
partially burned vegetation and fire boundaries and its transferability and
high generalization in burned area mapping. This research contributes to the
advancement of automated fire damage assessment and provides a scalable
solution for global burn area monitoring using the AlphaEarth dataset.

Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在图像描述和视觉问答任务中容易产生与视觉输入冲突的幻觉现象，先前的方法通常对所有层和注意力头进行统一调整，无法准确定位错误来源。

Method: 提出了两种诊断方法：层图像注意力熵(LIAE)用于标记异常层，图像注意力聚焦(IAF)用于对异常层中的注意力头进行评分。基于这些信号，开发了动态层级熵和注意力融合(D-LEAF)方法，在推理过程中动态定位和修正错误。

Result: 在标准图像描述基准上相对改进53%，在视觉问答任务中准确率和F1分数均提升约4%，显著抑制幻觉现象的同时保持效率。

Conclusion: D-LEAF方法能够有效定位和修正多模态大语言模型中的注意力异常，显著减少幻觉现象，为改进模型性能提供了新的诊断和修正框架。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on tasks
like image captioning and visual question answering, but remain prone to
hallucinations, where generated text conflicts with the visual input. Prior
work links this partly to insufficient visual attention, but existing
attention-based detectors and mitigation typically apply uniform adjustments
across layers and heads, obscuring where errors originate. In this paper, we
first show these methods fail to accurately localize problematic layers. Then,
we introduce two diagnostics: Layer Image Attention Entropy (LIAE) which flags
anomalous layers, and Image Attention Focus (IAF) which scores attention heads
within those layers. Analysis shows that LIAE pinpoints faulty layers and IAF
reliably ranks heads that warrant correction. Guided by these signals, we
propose Dynamic Layer-wise Entropy and Attention Fusion (D-LEAF), a
task-agnostic, attention-guided method that dynamically localizes and corrects
errors during inference with negligible overhead. Results show our D-LEAF
delivers a 53% relative improvement on standard captioning benchmarks, and on
VQA both accuracy and F1-score improve by approximately 4%, substantially
suppressing hallucinations while preserving efficiency.

Abstract: Active Membership Inference Test (aMINT) is a method designed to detect
whether given data were used during the training of machine learning models. In
Active MINT, we propose a novel multitask learning process that involves
training simultaneously two models: the original or Audited Model, and a
secondary model, referred to as the MINT Model, responsible for identifying the
data used for training the Audited Model. This novel multi-task learning
approach has been designed to incorporate the auditability of the model as an
optimization objective during the training process of neural networks. The
proposed approach incorporates intermediate activation maps as inputs to the
MINT layers, which are trained to enhance the detection of training data. We
present results using a wide range of neural networks, from lighter
architectures such as MobileNet to more complex ones such as Vision
Transformers, evaluated in 5 public benchmarks. Our proposed Active MINT
achieves over 80% accuracy in detecting if given data was used for training,
significantly outperforming previous approaches in the literature. Our aMINT
and related methodological developments contribute to increasing transparency

proper security, privacy, and copyright protection.

TL;DR: OCNet提出了一种对象级相关性网络，通过建立支持目标对象与查询通用对象之间的对象级相关性来解决少样本语义分割中的硬像素噪声问题，在PASCAL-5i和COCO-20i数据集上达到了最先进的性能。

Motivation: 现有方法主要建立在支持目标对象与整个查询图像之间的图像级相关性，但这种相关性包含难以追踪和抑制的硬像素噪声（如无关背景对象），导致背景过拟合。

Method: 设计对象级相关性网络（OCNet），包含通用对象挖掘模块（GOMM）和相关性构建模块（CCM）。GOMM通过学习显著性和高层相似性线索构建查询通用对象特征，CCM通过分配目标原型来匹配通用对象特征建立对象级相关性。

Result: 在PASCAL-5i和COCO-20i数据集上的大量实验表明，该模型实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过模仿生物视觉过程，在对象级信息中识别新对象，建立对象级相关性可以挖掘查询目标特征并抑制硬像素噪声，从而提升少样本语义分割的性能。

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) aims to segment objects of novel
categories in the query images given only a few annotated support samples.
Existing methods primarily build the image-level correlation between the
support target object and the entire query image. However, this correlation
contains the hard pixel noise, \textit{i.e.}, irrelevant background objects,
that is intractable to trace and suppress, leading to the overfitting of the
background. To address the limitation of this correlation, we imitate the
biological vision process to identify novel objects in the object-level
information. Target identification in the general objects is more valid than in
the entire image, especially in the low-data regime. Inspired by this, we
design an Object-level Correlation Network (OCNet) by establishing the
object-level correlation between the support target object and query general
objects, which is mainly composed of the General Object Mining Module (GOMM)
and Correlation Construction Module (CCM). Specifically, GOMM constructs the
query general object feature by learning saliency and high-level similarity
cues, where the general objects include the irrelevant background objects and
the target foreground object. Then, CCM establishes the object-level
correlation by allocating the target prototypes to match the general object
feature. The generated object-level correlation can mine the query target
feature and suppress the hard pixel noise for the final prediction. Extensive
experiments on PASCAL-${5}^{i}$ and COCO-${20}^{i}$ show that our model
achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Joint reconstruction of human-object interaction marks a significant
milestone in comprehending the intricate interrelations between humans and
their surrounding environment. Nevertheless, previous optimization methods
often struggle to achieve physically plausible reconstruction results due to
the lack of prior knowledge about human-object interactions. In this paper, we
introduce ScoreHOI, an effective diffusion-based optimizer that introduces
diffusion priors for the precise recovery of human-object interactions. By
harnessing the controllability within score-guided sampling, the diffusion
model can reconstruct a conditional distribution of human and object pose given
the image observation and object feature. During inference, the ScoreHOI
effectively improves the reconstruction results by guiding the denoising
process with specific physical constraints. Furthermore, we propose a
contact-driven iterative refinement approach to enhance the contact
plausibility and improve the reconstruction accuracy. Extensive evaluations on
standard benchmarks demonstrate ScoreHOI's superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its ability to achieve a precise and
robust improvement in joint human-object interaction reconstruction.

Conclusion: ToothMCL框架为数字牙科提供了一种高效的多模态预训练方案，能够准确识别FDI牙齿编号，具有重要的临床应用价值

Abstract: Digital dentistry represents a transformative shift in modern dental
practice. The foundational step in this transformation is the accurate digital
representation of the patient's dentition, which is obtained from segmented
Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and Intraoral Scans (IOS). Despite the
growing interest in digital dental technologies, existing segmentation
methodologies frequently lack rigorous validation and demonstrate limited
performance and clinical applicability. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to introduce a multimodal pretraining framework for tooth
segmentation. We present ToothMCL, a Tooth Multimodal Contrastive Learning for
pretraining that integrates volumetric (CBCT) and surface-based (IOS)
modalities. By capturing modality-invariant representations through multimodal
contrastive learning, our approach effectively models fine-grained anatomical
features, enabling precise multi-class segmentation and accurate identification
of F\'ed\'eration Dentaire Internationale (FDI) tooth numbering. Along with the
framework, we curated CBCT-IOS3.8K, the largest paired CBCT and IOS dataset to
date, comprising 3,867 patients. We then evaluated ToothMCL on a comprehensive
collection of independent datasets, representing the largest and most diverse
evaluation to date. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
internal and external testing, with an increase of 12\% for CBCT segmentation
and 8\% for IOS segmentation in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).
Furthermore, ToothMCL consistently surpasses existing approaches in tooth
groups and demonstrates robust generalizability across varying imaging
conditions and clinical scenarios.

Conclusion: 该研究为在消费级设备上部署高性能实时AI提供了实用可复现的解决方案，将优化重点从纯粹模型优化转向硬件感知的推理策略，最大化吞吐量。

Abstract: As local AI grows in popularity, there is a critical gap between the
benchmark performance of object detectors and their practical viability on
consumer-grade hardware. While models like YOLOv10s promise real-time speeds,
these metrics are typically achieved on high-power, desktop-class GPUs. This
paper reveals that on resource-constrained systems, such as laptops with RTX
4060 GPUs, performance is not compute-bound but is instead dominated by
system-level bottlenecks, as illustrated by a simple bottleneck test. To
overcome this hardware-level constraint, we introduce a Two-Pass Adaptive
Inference algorithm, a model-independent approach that requires no
architectural changes. This study mainly focuses on adaptive inference
strategies and undertakes a comparative analysis of architectural early-exit
and resolution-adaptive routing, highlighting their respective trade-offs
within a unified evaluation framework. The system uses a fast, low-resolution
pass and only escalates to a high-resolution model pass when detection
confidence is low. On a 5000-image COCO dataset, our method achieves a 1.85x
speedup over a PyTorch Early-Exit baseline, with a modest mAP loss of 5.51%.
This work provides a practical and reproducible blueprint for deploying
high-performance, real-time AI on consumer-grade devices by shifting the focus
from pure model optimization to hardware-aware inference strategies that
maximize throughput.

Abstract: Characterization of uncooperative Resident Space Objects (RSO) play a crucial
role in On-Orbit Servicing (OOS) and Active Debris Removal (ADR) missions to
assess the geometry and motion properties. To address the challenges of
reconstructing tumbling uncooperative targets, this study evaluates the
performance of existing state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction algorithms for
dynamic scenes, focusing on their ability to generate geometrically accurate
models with high-fidelity. To support our evaluation, we developed a simulation
environment using Isaac Sim to generate physics-accurate 2D image sequences of
tumbling satellite under realistic orbital lighting conditions. Our preliminary
results on static scenes using Neuralangelo demonstrate promising
reconstruction quality. The generated 3D meshes closely match the original CAD
models with minimal errors and artifacts when compared using Cloud Compare
(CC). The reconstructed models were able to capture critical fine details for
mission planning. This provides a baseline for our ongoing evaluation of
dynamic scene reconstruction.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度神经网络内部特征提取过程的黑盒问题，通过生成特征匹配的图像来揭示DNN编码的图像属性。

Method: 使用引导扩散模型，在预训练扩散模型的反向图像生成过程中最小化生成图像特征与指定特征之间的欧氏距离。

Result: 实验针对CLIP图像编码器、ResNet-50和视觉变换器，生成图像的特征与指定特征高度相似，揭示了这些DNN特征空间的宝贵见解。

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外训练即可分析不同DNN的特征空间，在单个商用GPU上运行，为理解DNN内部特征表示提供了有效工具。

Abstract: One of the key issues in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is the black-box nature
of their internal feature extraction process. Targeting vision-related domains,
this paper focuses on analysing the feature space of a DNN by proposing a
decoder that can generate images whose features are guaranteed to closely match
a user-specified feature. Owing to this guarantee that is missed in past
studies, our decoder allows us to evidence which of various attributes in an
image are encoded into a feature by the DNN, by generating images whose
features are in proximity to that feature. Our decoder is implemented as a
guided diffusion model that guides the reverse image generation of a
pre-trained diffusion model to minimise the Euclidean distance between the
feature of a clean image estimated at each step and the user-specified feature.
One practical advantage of our decoder is that it can analyse feature spaces of
different DNNs with no additional training and run on a single COTS GPU. The
experimental results targeting CLIP's image encoder, ResNet-50 and vision
transformer demonstrate that images generated by our decoder have features
remarkably similar to the user-specified ones and reveal valuable insights into
these DNNs' feature spaces.

TL;DR: OnePoseViaGen是一个从单张参考图像估计任意未见物体6D姿态的先进方法，通过粗到精对齐和文本引导域随机化策略，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，并成功应用于真实机器人抓取任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人操作中遇到的任意未见物体6D姿态估计问题，传统方法面临3D模型稀缺、单视图重建缺乏度量尺度、生成模型与真实图像存在域差距等挑战。

Method: 提出包含两个关键组件的管道：1）粗到精对齐模块，通过多视图特征匹配和渲染比较细化联合优化尺度和姿态；2）文本引导生成域随机化策略，多样化纹理以有效微调姿态估计器。

Result: 在YCBInEOAT、Toyota-Light、LM-O等挑战性基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，远超先前方法，并在真实机器人手上展示了稳健的灵巧抓取能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过高保真单视图3D生成支持可靠的单次6D姿态估计，验证了在真实世界操作中的实用性，为机器人处理长尾实例提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of arbitrary unseen objects from a single reference
image is critical for robotics operating in the long-tail of real-world
instances. However, this setting is notoriously challenging: 3D models are
rarely available, single-view reconstructions lack metric scale, and domain
gaps between generated models and real-world images undermine robustness. We
propose OnePoseViaGen, a pipeline that tackles these challenges through two key
components. First, a coarse-to-fine alignment module jointly refines scale and
pose by combining multi-view feature matching with render-and-compare
refinement. Second, a text-guided generative domain randomization strategy
diversifies textures, enabling effective fine-tuning of pose estimators with
synthetic data. Together, these steps allow high-fidelity single-view 3D
generation to support reliable one-shot 6D pose estimation. On challenging
benchmarks (YCBInEOAT, Toyota-Light, LM-O), OnePoseViaGen achieves
state-of-the-art performance far surpassing prior approaches. We further
demonstrate robust dexterous grasping with a real robot hand, validating the
practicality of our method in real-world manipulation. Project page:

TL;DR: VIRAL是一种通过视觉表示对齐来增强多模态大语言模型视觉推理能力的正则化策略，与预训练视觉基础模型对齐内部视觉表示，保留关键视觉细节


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在视觉中心任务（如物体计数、空间推理）上表现有限，主要原因是文本监督范式只能提供视觉通路的间接指导，导致模型在训练过程中丢弃细粒度视觉细节

Method: 提出VIRAL（Visual Representation ALignment）方法，将MLLMs的内部视觉表示与预训练视觉基础模型（VFMs）的表示进行对齐，通过显式强制对齐来保留输入视觉编码器的关键视觉细节并补充额外的视觉知识

Result: 实验表明在广泛采用的多模态基准测试的所有任务上都取得了持续改进，并通过全面的消融研究验证了关键设计选择

Conclusion: 这一简单发现为在训练MLLMs中有效整合视觉信息开辟了重要方向

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) trained with visual instruction
tuning have achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, yet they remain
limited in vision-centric tasks such as object counting or spatial reasoning.
We attribute this gap to the prevailing text-only supervision paradigm, which
provides only indirect guidance for the visual pathway and often leads MLLMs to
discard fine-grained visual details during training. In this paper, we present
VIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization
strategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of
pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this
alignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details
from the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual
knowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex
visual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all
tasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying
our framework. We believe this simple finding opens up an important direction
for the effective integration of visual information in training MLLMs.
