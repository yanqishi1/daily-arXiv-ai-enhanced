We introduce\nSpecification Self-Correction (SSC), a novel, test-time framework that enables\nan LM to identify and correct flaws within its own guiding specification. SSC\nemploys a multi-step inference process where the model first generates a\nresponse based on a potentially tainted specification, critiques its output,\nand then revises the specification itself to remove the exploitable loophole. A\nfinal, more robust response is then generated using this self-corrected\nspecification. Across experiments spanning creative writing and agentic coding\ntasks with several LMs, we demonstrate that while models initially game tainted\nspecifications in 50-70\\% of cases, the SSC process reduces this vulnerability\nby over 90\\%. This dynamic repair occurs at inference time, requires no weight\nmodification, and leads to more robustly aligned model behavior.

Critical to ML-ADAS is the\ncollision avoidance feature, which requires the ability to detect objects and\nestimate their distances accurately.

However, the traditional centralized\nlearning paradigm poses serious privacy risks as all data is collected and\ntrained on a single server. To mitigate this challenge, decentralized\napproaches such as federated learning and swarm learning have emerged, allowing\nmodel training on local nodes while sharing only model weights. While these\nmethods enhance privacy, they struggle with heterogeneous and imbalanced data\nand suffer from inefficiencies due to frequent communication and the\naggregation of weights. More critically, the dynamic and complex nature of\nclinical environments demands scalable AI systems capable of continuously\nlearning from diverse modalities and multilabels. Yet, both centralized and\ndecentralized models are prone to catastrophic forgetting during system\nexpansion, often requiring full model retraining to incorporate new data. To\naddress these limitations, we propose VGS-ATD, a novel distributed learning\nframework. To validate VGS-ATD, we evaluate it in experiments spanning 30\ndatasets and 80 independent labels across distributed nodes, VGS-ATD achieved\nan overall accuracy of 92.7%, outperforming centralized learning (84.9%) and\nswarm learning (72.99%), while federated learning failed under these conditions\ndue to high requirements on computational resources.

In practice, when humans attempt to\npredict the next location in a trajectory, they often visualize the trajectory\non a map and reason based on road connectivity and movement trends. However,\nthe vast majority of existing next-location prediction models do not reason\nover maps \\textbf{in the way that humans do}. Fortunately, the recent\ndevelopment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has demonstrated strong\ncapabilities in visual perception and even visual reasoning. This opens up a\nnew possibility: by rendering both the road network and trajectory onto an\nimage and leveraging the reasoning abilities of VLMs, we can enable models to\nperform trajectory inference in a human-like manner. To explore this idea, we\nfirst propose a method called Vision-Guided Location Search (VGLS), which\nevaluates whether a general-purpose VLM is capable of trajectory-based\nreasoning without modifying any of its internal parameters.

However, estimating the unloaded geometry from clinical\nimages remains a challenging task. Traditional approaches rely on inverse\nfinite element (FE) solvers that require iterative optimization and are\ncomputationally expensive. In this work, we introduce HeartUnloadNet, a deep\nlearning framework that predicts the unloaded left ventricular (LV) shape\ndirectly from the end diastolic (ED) mesh while explicitly incorporating\nbiophysical priors. The network accepts a mesh of arbitrary size along with\nphysiological parameters such as ED pressure, myocardial stiffness scale, and\nfiber helix orientation, and outputs the corresponding unloaded mesh. It adopts\na graph attention architecture and employs a cycle-consistency strategy to\nenable bidirectional (loading and unloading) prediction, allowing for partial\nself-supervision that improves accuracy and reduces the need for large training\ndatasets. Trained and tested on 20,700 FE simulations across diverse LV\ngeometries and physiological conditions, HeartUnloadNet achieves sub-millimeter\naccuracy, with an average DSC of 0.986 and HD of 0.083 cm, while reducing\ninference time to just 0.02 seconds per case, over 10^5 times faster and\nsignificantly more accurate than traditional inverse FE solvers. Ablation\nstudies confirm the effectiveness of the architecture. Notably, the\ncycle-consistent design enables the model to maintain a DSC of 97% even with as\nfew as 200 training samples.

However, these approaches struggle with\nmore complex math problems that require precise reasoning over multiple steps.\nTo address this limitation, in this work, we propose Multi-TAG, a Multi-Tool\nAGgregation-based framework.

Recent works have addressed the problem by representing the\nentire non-obstacle road regions as the free-space. In contrast our aim is to\nestimate the driving corridors that are a navigable subset of the entire road\nregion. Unfortunately, existing corridor estimation methods directly assume a\nBEV-centric representation, which is hard to obtain. In contrast, we frame\ndrivable free-space corridor prediction as a pure image perception task, using\nonly monocular camera input. However such a formulation poses several\nchallenges as one doesn't have the corresponding data for such free-space\ncorridor segments in the image. Consequently, we develop a novel\nself-supervised approach for free-space sample generation by leveraging future\nego trajectories and front-view camera images, making the process of visual\ncorridor estimation dependent on the ego trajectory. We then employ a diffusion\nprocess to model the distribution of such segments in the image. However, the\nexisting binary mask-based representation for a segment poses many limitations.\nTherefore, we introduce ContourDiff, a specialized diffusion-based architecture\nthat denoises over contour points rather than relying on binary mask\nrepresentations, enabling structured and interpretable free-space predictions.\nWe evaluate our approach qualitatively and quantitatively on both nuScenes and\nCARLA, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately predicting safe multimodal\nnavigable corridors in the image.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u76ee\u76f8\u673a\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u9a7e\u9a76\u81ea\u7531\u7a7a\u95f4\u8d70\u5eca\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8f6e\u5ed3\u70b9\u53bb\u566a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56BEV\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\uff1b\u800c\u81ea\u7531\u7a7a\u95f4\u8d70\u5eca\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f8\u5173\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u672a\u6765\u81ea\u8f66\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u5355\u76ee\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u91c7\u7528ContourDiff\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u8f6e\u5ed3\u70b9\u800c\u975e\u4e8c\u503c\u63a9\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u5728nuScenes\u548cCARLA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u53ef\u5bfc\u822a\u8d70\u5eca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700BEV\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u50cf\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u7a7a\u95f4\u8d70\u5eca\u9884\u6d4b\u3002"}}

However, Recurrent LLMs often underperform on long-context tasks\ndue to their limited fixed-size memory. Previous research has primarily focused\non enhancing the memory capacity of Recurrent LLMs through architectural\ninnovations, but these approaches have not yet enabled Recurrent LLMs to match\nthe performance of Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We argue that\nthis limitation arises because processing the entire context at once is not\nwell-suited for Recurrent LLMs. In this paper, we propose Smooth Reading, a\nchunk-wise inference method inspired by human reading strategies. Smooth\nReading processes context in chunks and iteratively summarizes the contextual\ninformation, thereby reducing memory demands and making the approach more\ncompatible with Recurrent LLMs. Our experimental results show that this method\nsubstantially narrows the performance gap between Recurrent and Self-Attention\nLLMs on long-context tasks, while preserving the efficiency advantages of\nRecurrent LLMs. Our Smooth Reading boosts SWA-3B-4k (a Recurrent LLM) from\n5.68% lower to 3.61% higher performance than Self-Attention LLMs on LongBench.\nBesides, our method maintains the high efficiency, training 3x faster and\ninferring 2x faster at 64k context compared to Self-Attention LLMs. To our\nknowledge, this is the first work to achieve comparable performance using\nRecurrent LLMs compared with Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks.

Specifically, we employ an autoencoder to project input point\nclouds into compact MAT representations that capture the intrinsic geometric\nstructure of point clouds. By perturbing these intrinsic representations,\nMAT-Adv introduces structural-level adversarial characteristics that remain\neffective across diverse models and defense strategies. To mitigate overfitting\nand prevent perturbation collapse, we incorporate a dropout strategy into the\noptimization of MAT perturbations, further improving transferability and\nundefendability.

However, since floorplans\nare minimalist representations of a building's structure, modal and geometric\ndifferences between visual perceptions and floorplans pose challenges to this\ntask. While existing methods cleverly utilize 2D geometric features and pose\nfilters to achieve promising performance, they fail to address the localization\nerrors caused by frequent visual changes and view occlusions due to variously\nshaped 3D objects. To tackle these issues, this paper views the 2D Floorplan\nLocalization (FLoc) problem from a higher dimension by injecting 3D geometric\npriors into the visual FLoc algorithm. For the 3D geometric prior modeling, we\nfirst model geometrically aware view invariance using multi-view constraints,\ni.e., leveraging imaging geometric principles to provide matching constraints\nbetween multiple images that see the same points. Then, we further model the\nview-scene aligned geometric priors, enhancing the cross-modal geometry-color\ncorrespondences by associating the scene's surface reconstruction with the RGB\nframes of the sequence. Both 3D priors are modeled through self-supervised\ncontrastive learning, thus no additional geometric or semantic annotations are\nrequired. These 3D priors summarized in extensive realistic scenes bridge the\nmodal gap while improving localization success without increasing the\ncomputational burden on the FLoc algorithm. Sufficient comparative studies\ndemonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nand substantially boosts the FLoc accuracy.

We trained a Bidirectional\nLong Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model and four transformer-based Dutch and/or\nmultilingual encoder models (BERTje, RobBERT, MedRoBERTa.nl, and NuNER) for the\ntasks of named entity recognition (NER) and relation classification (RC) using\n102 richly annotated Dutch ICU clinical progress notes. Anonymized free text\nclinical progress notes of patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of\none academic hospital and discharge letters of patients admitted to Internal\nMedicine wards of two non-academic hospitals were reused. We evaluated our ADE\nRC models internally using gold standard (two-step task) and predicted entities\n(end-to-end task). In addition, all models were externally validated on\ndetecting ADEs at the document level. We report both micro- and macro-averaged\nF1 scores, given the imbalance of ADEs in the datasets. Although differences\nfor the ADE RC task between the models were small, MedRoBERTa.nl was the best\nperforming model with macro-averaged F1 score of 0.63 using gold standard and\n0.62 using predicted entities.

However, directly training with synthetic datasets\ncompared to real datasets can lead to a degradation in model performance. To\ntackle this problem, in this work, we investigate a new task, namely\nSyn-to-Real Camouflaged Object Detection (S2R-COD).

Our approach incorporates three key innovations: (i)\nleveraging SAM with High-Quality masks (SAM-HQ) alongside appearance-based\ncandidate-selection to refine coarse segmentation masks, resulting in improved\nobject boundaries; (ii) implementing a dynamic smart memory mechanism that\nselectively stores relevant key frames while discarding redundant ones, thereby\noptimizing memory usage and processing efficiency for long-term videos; and\n(iii) dynamically updating the appearance model to effectively handle complex\ntopological object variations and reduce drift throughout the video. These\ncontributions mitigate several limitations of existing VOS models including,\ncoarse segmentations that mix-in background pixels, fixed memory update\nschedules, brittleness to drift and occlusions, and prompt ambiguity issues\nassociated with SAM. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple public\ndatasets and state-of-the-art base trackers demonstrate that our method\nconsistently ranks among the top two on VOTS and VOTSt 2024 datasets.

To address this, we propose a novel\nmulti-granularity hierarchical fusion transformer (MGHFT), with a multi-view\nsticker interpreter based on Multimodal Large Language Models. Specifically,\ninspired by the human ability to interpret sticker emotions from multiple\nviews, we first use Multimodal Large Language Models to interpret stickers by\nproviding rich textual context via multi-view descriptions. Then, we design a\nhierarchical fusion strategy to fuse the textual context into visual\nunderstanding, which builds upon a pyramid visual transformer to extract both\nglobal and local sticker features at multiple stages. Through contrastive\nlearning and attention mechanisms, textual features are injected at different\nstages of the visual backbone, enhancing the fusion of global- and\nlocal-granularity visual semantics with textual guidance. Finally, we introduce\na text-guided fusion attention mechanism to effectively integrate the overall\nmultimodal features, enhancing semantic understanding. Extensive experiments on\n2 public sticker emotion datasets demonstrate that MGHFT significantly\noutperforms existing sticker emotion recognition approaches, achieving higher\naccuracy and more fine-grained emotion recognition. Compared to the best\npre-trained visual models, our MGHFT also obtains an obvious improvement, 5.4%\non F1 and 4.0% on accuracy.

This signal is further\ncalibrated using the image homogeneity metric to improve accuracy, which\ninherently cancels out absolute biases caused by image complexity, with\nautoencoder-based reconstruction ensuring superior computational efficiency.\nExperiments on eight top latent diffusion models show that AEDR achieves 25.5%\nhigher attribution accuracy than existing reconstruction-based methods, while\nrequiring only 1% of the computational time.", "AI": {"tldr": "AEDR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u91cd\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u540c\u8d28\u6027\u6821\u51c6\u63d0\u9ad8\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6eaf\u6e90\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6eaf\u6e90\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u91cd\u5efa\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAEDR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u53cc\u91cd\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u5efa\u635f\u5931\u6bd4\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u540c\u8d28\u6027\u6821\u51c6\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516b\u79cd\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cAEDR\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad825.5%\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u4ec5\u97001%\u3002", "conclusion": "AEDR\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u56fe\u50cf\u6eaf\u6e90\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

To this end, existing methods focus on enhancing point\ncloud quality by developing dedicated denoising and completion models. However,\ndue to the isolation between the point cloud enhancement and downstream tasks,\nthese methods fail to work in various real-world domains. In addition, the\nconflicting objectives between denoising and completing tasks further limit the\nensemble paradigm to preserve critical geometric features. To tackle the above\nchallenges, we propose a unified point-level prompting method that reformulates\npoint cloud denoising and completion as a prompting mechanism, enabling robust\nanalysis in a parameter-efficient manner. We start by introducing a\nRectification Prompter to adapt to noisy points through the predicted\nrectification vector prompts, effectively filtering noise while preserving\nintricate geometric features essential for accurate analysis. Sequentially, we\nfurther incorporate a Completion Prompter to generate auxiliary point prompts\nbased on the rectified point clouds, facilitating their robustness and\nadaptability. Finally, a Shape-Aware Unit module is exploited to efficiently\nunify and capture the filtered geometric features for the downstream point\ncloud analysis.Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the\nsuperiority and robustness of our method when handling noisy and incomplete\npoint cloud data against existing state-of-the-art methods.

FG-RF on the client side accelerates generative modeling\nin medical imaging scenarios while preserving privacy by synthesizing\nfeature-level images rather than pixel-level images. To handle non-IID\ndistributions, DLKD enables the global student model to simultaneously mimic\nthe output logits and align the intermediate-layer features of client-side\nteacher models during aggregation. Experimental results on three non-IID\nmedical imaging datasets show that our new framework and method outperform\nmulti-round federated learning approaches, achieving up to 21.73% improvement,\nand exceeds the baseline FedISCA by an average of 21.75%.

Methods: In this study, a self-training framework is\nproposed by leveraging a teacher-student model for the segmentation of\npulmonary vessels. First, the high-quality annotations are acquired in the\nin-house data by an interactive way. Then, the model is trained in the\nsemi-supervised way. A fully supervised model is trained on a small set of\nlabeled CT images, yielding the teacher model. Following this, the teacher\nmodel is used to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled CT images, from which\nreliable ones are selected based on a certain strategy. The training of the\nstudent model involves these reliable pseudo-labels. This training process is\niteratively repeated until an optimal performance is achieved. Results:\nExtensive experiments are performed on non-enhanced CT scans of 125 COPD\npatients. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod, Semi2, significantly improves the precision of vessel segmentation by\n2.3%, achieving a precision of 90.3%.

However, the development of accurate and robust methods\nis often limited by insufficient data availability and a lack of diversity in\nlesion characteristics. While generative models offer a promising solution for\ndata synthesis, current approaches often fail to adequately emphasize\nlesion-specific features and their relationships with surrounding tissues. In\nthis paper, we propose Gated Conditional Diffusion Model (GCDM), a novel\nframework designed to jointly synthesize holistic mammogram images and\nlocalized lesions. GCDM is built upon a latent denoising diffusion framework,\nwhere the noised latent image is concatenated with a soft mask embedding that\nrepresents breast, lesion, and their transitional regions, ensuring anatomical\ncoherence between them during the denoising process. To further emphasize\nlesion-specific features, GCDM incorporates a gated conditioning branch that\nguides the denoising process by dynamically selecting and fusing the most\nrelevant radiomic and geometric properties of lesions, effectively capturing\ntheir interplay. Experimental results demonstrate that GCDM achieves precise\ncontrol over small lesion areas while enhancing the realism and diversity of\nsynthesized mammograms.

Additionally, due to the\nscarcity of abnormal samples in industrial data, especially in multimodal\nscenarios, it is necessary to perform anomaly generation to simulate real-world\nabnormal samples. Therefore, we propose a novel unified multimodal anomaly\ndetection framework to address these issues. Our contributions consist of 3 key\naspects. (1) We extract visible depth information from 3D point cloud data\nsimply and use 2D RGB images to represent appearance, which disentangles depth\nand appearance to support unified anomaly generation. (2) Benefiting from the\nflexible input representation, the proposed Multi-Scale Gaussian Anomaly\nGenerator and Unified Texture Anomaly Generator can generate richer anomalies\nin RGB and depth. (3) All modules share parameters for both RGB and depth data,\neffectively bridging 2D and 3D anomaly detection. Subsequent modules can\ndirectly leverage features from both modalities without complex fusion.\nExperiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) on MVTec-3D AD\nand Eyecandies datasets.

Although CLIP\nperforms well on most of the primary classes in the dataset, our work reveals\nthat its effectiveness decreases significantly for classes with a long-tailed\ndistribution. Our approach employs a class-weighting mechanism that directly\naligns with the distribution of classes within the latent space. This method\nensures a substantial improvement in overall classification performance, with\nparticular emphasis on enhancing the recognition and accuracy of rarely\nobserved classes. We accomplish this by applying Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)\nclustering to the latent space. The subsequent clusters are further refined by\nStudent t-distribution, followed by a metric loss that utilizes the altered\nembeddings. Our approach facilitates stable and adaptive clustering of the\nfeatures.

To\naddress these limitations, this work contributes: (1) a Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN) based primitive initializer for 3DGS using monocular images; (2)\na pipeline capable of training with noisy or implicit pose estimates; and (3)\nand analysis of initialization variants that reduce the training cost of\nprecise 3D models. A CNN takes a single image as input and outputs a coarse 3D\nmodel represented as an assembly of primitives, along with the target's pose\nrelative to the camera. This assembly of primitives is then used to initialize\n3DGS, significantly reducing the number of training iterations and input images\nneeded -- by at least an order of magnitude. For additional flexibility, the\nCNN component has multiple variants with different pose estimation techniques.\nThis work performs a comparison between these variants, evaluating their\neffectiveness for downstream 3DGS training under noisy or implicit pose\nestimates. The results demonstrate that even with imperfect pose supervision,\nthe pipeline is able to learn high-fidelity 3D representations, opening the\ndoor for the use of novel view synthesis in space applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eCNN\u76843D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\uff083DGS\uff09\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u59ff\u6001\u548c\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf3D\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982NeRF\u548c3DGS\uff09\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528CNN\u4ece\u5355\u76ee\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7c97\u75653D\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u521d\u59cb\u53163DGS\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u9690\u5f0f\u59ff\u6001\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u9700\u6c42\uff08\u81f3\u5c11\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u59ff\u6001\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f3D\u8868\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u89c6\u56fe\u5408\u6210\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing approaches to build generalizable priors for 3D head\navatars often adopt a holistic modeling approach, treating the face and hair as\nan inseparable entity. This overlooks the inherent compositionality of the\nhuman head, making it difficult for the model to naturally disentangle face and\nhair representations, especially when the dataset is limited. Furthermore, such\nholistic models struggle to support applications like 3D face and hairstyle\nswapping in a flexible and controllable manner. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce a prior model that explicitly accounts for the compositionality of\nface and hair, learning their latent spaces separately. A key enabler of this\napproach is our synthetic hairless data creation pipeline, which removes hair\nfrom studio-captured datasets using estimated hairless geometry and texture\nderived from a diffusion prior. By leveraging a paired dataset of hair and\nhairless captures, we train disentangled prior models for face and hair,\nincorporating compositionality as an inductive bias to facilitate effective\nseparation. Our model's inherent compositionality enables seamless transfer of\nface and hair components between avatars while preserving identity.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate that our model can be fine-tuned in a few-shot\nmanner using monocular captures to create high-fidelity, hair-compositional 3D\nhead avatars for unseen subjects.
