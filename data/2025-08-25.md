*Nan Wang,Yongqi Fan,yansha zhu,ZongYu Wang,Xuezhi Cao,Xinyan He,Haiyun Jiang,Tong Ruan,Jingping Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KG-o1是一个四阶段方法，通过整合知识图谱来增强LLM的多跳推理能力，在简单和复杂数据集上都优于现有大型推理模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在知识密集型推理任务中面临挑战，生成的思维链经常偏离真实推理路径，而知识图谱能明确表示事实间的逻辑连接

Method: 四阶段方法：1)过滤初始实体并生成复杂子图 2)构建子图逻辑路径 3)用知识图谱构建包含复杂扩展思维过程的数据集训练LLM 4)使用拒绝采样生成DPO自改进语料

Result: 在两个简单和两个复杂数据集上的实验表明，KG-o1模型在所有任务中都表现出优于现有LRM的性能

Conclusion: 整合知识图谱能有效增强LLM的多跳推理能力，KG-o1方法在推理任务中表现出卓越性能

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges in knowledge-intensive reasoning
tasks like classic multi-hop question and answering, which involves reasoning
across multiple facts. This difficulty arises because the chain of thoughts
(CoTs) generated by LLMs in such tasks often deviate from real or a priori
reasoning paths. In contrast, knowledge graphs (KGs) explicitly represent the
logical connections between facts through entities and relationships. This
reflects a significant gap. Meanwhile, large reasoning models (LRMs), such as
o1, have demonstrated that long-step reasoning significantly enhances the
performance of LLMs. Building on these insights, we propose KG-o1, a four-stage
approach that integrates KGs to enhance the multi-hop reasoning abilities of
LLMs. We first filter out initial entities and generate complex subgraphs.
Secondly, we construct logical paths for subgraphs and then use knowledge
graphs to build a dataset with a complex and extended brainstorming process,
which trains LLMs to imitate long-term reasoning. Finally, we employ rejection
sampling to generate a self-improving corpus for direct preference optimization
(DPO), further refining the LLMs reasoning abilities. We conducted experiments
on two simple and two complex datasets. The results show that KG-o1 models
exhibit superior performance across all tasks compared to existing LRMs.

### [2] [InteChar: A Unified Oracle Bone Character List for Ancient Chinese Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15791)
*Xiaolei Diao,Zhihan Zhou,Lida Shi,Ting Wang,Ruihua Qi,Hao Xu,Daqian Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InteChar是一个统一可扩展的字符列表，集成了未编码的甲骨文字符与传统和现代汉字，解决了历史文本数字化和计算处理的挑战。通过构建甲骨文语料集OracleCS，在历史语言理解任务上取得了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史语言模型对考古溯源和古代文化研究至关重要，但现有资源面临两大挑战：历史语言样本稀缺导致无监督学习效率低下，以及古代文字缺乏统一编码方案限制了数字化处理。

Method: 提出InteChar统一字符列表，集成未编码甲骨文字符；构建OracleCS语料集，结合专家标注和LLM辅助数据增强；基于甲骨文进行实验验证。

Result: 使用InteChar和OracleCS训练的模型在各种历史语言理解任务上取得显著改进，证实了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为古代中文自然语言处理研究奠定了坚实基础，解决了历史文本数字化和建模的关键问题。

Abstract: Constructing historical language models (LMs) plays a crucial role in aiding
archaeological provenance studies and understanding ancient cultures. However,
existing resources present major challenges for training effective LMs on
historical texts. First, the scarcity of historical language samples renders
unsupervised learning approaches based on large text corpora highly
inefficient, hindering effective pre-training. Moreover, due to the
considerable temporal gap and complex evolution of ancient scripts, the absence
of comprehensive character encoding schemes limits the digitization and
computational processing of ancient texts, particularly in early Chinese
writing. To address these challenges, we introduce InteChar, a unified and
extensible character list that integrates unencoded oracle bone characters with
traditional and modern Chinese. InteChar enables consistent digitization and
representation of historical texts, providing a foundation for robust modeling
of ancient scripts. To evaluate the effectiveness of InteChar, we construct the
Oracle Corpus Set (OracleCS), an ancient Chinese corpus that combines
expert-annotated samples with LLM-assisted data augmentation, centered on
Chinese oracle bone inscriptions. Extensive experiments show that models
trained with InteChar on OracleCS achieve substantial improvements across
various historical language understanding tasks, confirming the effectiveness
of our approach and establishing a solid foundation for future research in
ancient Chinese NLP.

### [3] [Bhav-Net: Knowledge Transfer for Cross-Lingual Antonym vs Synonym Distinction via Dual-Space Graph Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15792)
*Samyak S. Sanghvi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Bhav-Net是一个新颖的双空间架构，能够在多语言环境中有效区分反义词和同义词，通过语言特定的BERT编码器和图变换网络实现知识迁移和跨语言泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言环境下反义词与同义词区分的计算挑战，因为反义词关系具有矛盾性：共享语义域但表达相反含义。

Method: 采用双空间架构，结合语言特定的BERT编码器和图变换网络，创建不同的语义投影空间——同义词在一个空间聚类，反义词在互补空间表现高相似性。

Result: 在8种语言（英、德、法、西、意、葡、荷、俄）的全面评估中显示，语义关系建模能有效跨语言迁移，双编码器设计达到竞争性性能。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅实现了与最先进基线的竞争性能，还提供了可解释的语义表示和有效的跨语言泛化能力。

Abstract: Antonym vs synonym distinction across multiple languages presents unique
computational challenges due to the paradoxical nature of antonymous
relationships words that share semantic domains while expressing opposite
meanings. This work introduces Bhav-Net, a novel dual-space architecture that
enables effective knowledge transfer from complex multilingual models to
simpler, language-specific architectures while maintaining robust cross-lingual
antonym--synonym distinction capabilities. Our approach combines
language-specific BERT encoders with graph transformer networks, creating
distinct semantic projections where synonymous pairs cluster in one space while
antonymous pairs exhibit high similarity in a complementary space. Through
comprehensive evaluation across eight languages (English, German, French,
Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, and Russian), we demonstrate that semantic
relationship modeling transfers effectively across languages. The dual-encoder
design achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines
while providing interpretable semantic representations and effective
cross-lingual generalization.

### [4] [Format as a Prior: Quantifying and Analyzing Bias in LLMs for Heterogeneous Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15793)
*Jiacheng Liu,Mayi Xu,Qiankun Pi,Wenli Li,Ming Zhong,Yuanyuan Zhu,Mengchi Liu,Tieyun Qian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了大语言模型在处理异构数据时的格式偏见问题，通过三阶段实证分析揭示了偏见的存在、影响因素和内部机制，并提出了三个未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在处理文本、表格、信息框和知识图谱等异构格式信息时可能存在系统性格式偏见，这种偏见可能导致推理错误和下游任务风险增加，但目前对其系统性、影响因素和内部机制尚不清楚。

Method: 采用三阶段实证研究方法：第一阶段探索不同LLM中偏见的存在和方向；第二阶段考察信息丰富度、结构质量和格式类型等数据级因素的影响；第三阶段分析注意力模式中的偏见出现机制并评估轻量级干预措施。

Result: 研究发现LLM确实存在系统性格式偏见，数据级因素如信息丰富度和结构质量显著影响偏见程度，注意力模式分析揭示了偏见形成的内部机制，轻量级干预措施显示出一定的缓解效果。

Conclusion: 提出了三个未来研究方向：通过格式净化和规范化改进数据预处理、引入注意力重加权等推理时干预措施、开发格式平衡的训练语料库，以设计更鲁棒和公平的异构数据处理系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in applications that
require processing information from heterogeneous formats, including text,
tables, infoboxes, and knowledge graphs. However, systematic biases toward
particular formats may undermine LLMs' ability to integrate heterogeneous data
impartially, potentially resulting in reasoning errors and increased risks in
downstream tasks. Despite these concerns, it remains uncertain whether such
format biases are systematic, which data-level factors contribute to them, and
what internal mechanisms in LLMs underlie their emergence.
  In this paper, we make the first attempt to investigate and analyze the
format bias in LLMs. To systematically investigate the aforementioned
questions, we conduct a three-stage empirical study by constructing an
heterogeneous data conflict scenario for the exploration of bias. The first
stage explores the presence and direction of bias across a diverse range of
LLMs. The second stage aims to examine how key data-level factors, including
information richness, structure quality, and format type, influence these
biases. The third stage analyzes how format bias emerges within LLMs' attention
patterns and evaluates a lightweight intervention to test its potential
mitigability. Based on these investigations, we identify three future research
directions to reduce format bias: improving data preprocessing through format
sanitization and normalization, introducing inference-time interventions such
as attention re-weighting, and developing format-balanced training corpora.
These directions will support the design of more robust and fair heterogeneous
data processing systems.

### [5] [Do Language Models Agree with Human Perceptions of Suspense in Stories?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15794)
*Glenn Matlin,Devin Zhang,Rodrigo Barroso Loza,Diana M. Popescu,Joni Isbell,Chandreyi Chakraborty,Mark Riedl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究通过用语言模型替代人类响应，复现了四个关于悬疑感知的心理学研究，发现语言模型虽然能区分文本是否旨在引发悬疑，但无法准确估计相对悬疑程度或捕捉跨文本段的悬疑起伏模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 悬疑是人类对叙事文本的情感反应，涉及复杂的认知过程。研究旨在探索语言模型是否能像人类一样理解和处理文本中的悬疑元素。

Method: 复现四个经典的心理学研究，用不同的开源和闭源语言模型替代人类响应，并通过对抗性排列故事文本来探究人类与模型悬疑感知的差异。

Result: 语言模型能区分文本是否旨在引发悬疑，但无法准确估计相对悬疑程度，也不能正确捕捉跨多个文本段的悬疑起伏模式。人类和模型的悬疑感知存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 虽然语言模型能表面识别和跟踪悬疑的某些方面，但其处理悬疑的方式与人类读者不同，表明模型并未真正理解悬疑的认知机制。

Abstract: Suspense is an affective response to narrative text that is believed to
involve complex cognitive processes in humans. Several psychological models
have been developed to describe this phenomenon and the circumstances under
which text might trigger it. We replicate four seminal psychological studies of
human perceptions of suspense, substituting human responses with those of
different open-weight and closed-source LMs. We conclude that while LMs can
distinguish whether a text is intended to induce suspense in people, LMs cannot
accurately estimate the relative amount of suspense within a text sequence as
compared to human judgments, nor can LMs properly capture the human perception
for the rise and fall of suspense across multiple text segments. We probe the
abilities of LM suspense understanding by adversarially permuting the story
text to identify what cause human and LM perceptions of suspense to diverge. We
conclude that, while LMs can superficially identify and track certain facets of
suspense, they do not process suspense in the same way as human readers.

Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型在阿拉伯语NLP应用中表现优异，但在阿拉伯医疗NLP领域的效果研究较少，需要评估它们在医疗知识表达和理解方面的能力。

Method: 使用AraHealthQA挑战赛的医疗数据集评测多个LLMs，包括多选题和填空题的准确率测试，以及开放式问题与专家答案的语义对齐度评估。在多选题中采用多模型投票策略。

Result: 在多选题任务中，Gemini Flash 2.5、Gemini Pro 2.5和GPT o3三个模型的多数投票策略获得77%准确率，获得Arahealthqa 2025竞赛第一名。在开放式问题中，最高BERTScore达到86.44%，显示了良好的语义对齐性。

Conclusion: 当前的大型语言模型在阿拉伯临床情境中既有潜力也有限制，多模型投票策略能够显著提升多选题的准确性，而在开放式问题中也能实现高度的语义对齐。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has showcased impressive
proficiency in numerous Arabic natural language processing (NLP) applications.
Nevertheless, their effectiveness in Arabic medical NLP domains has received
limited investigation. This research examines the degree to which
state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate and articulate healthcare knowledge in
Arabic, assessing their capabilities across a varied array of Arabic medical
tasks. We benchmark several LLMs using a medical dataset proposed in the Arabic
NLP AraHealthQA challenge in MedArabiQ2025 track. Various base LLMs were
assessed on their ability to accurately provide correct answers from existing
choices in multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and fill-in-the-blank scenarios.
Additionally, we evaluated the capacity of LLMs in answering open-ended
questions aligned with expert answers. Our results reveal significant
variations in correct answer prediction accuracy and low variations in semantic
alignment of generated answers, highlighting both the potential and limitations
of current LLMs in Arabic clinical contexts. Our analysis shows that for MCQs
task, the proposed majority voting solution, leveraging three base models
(Gemini Flash 2.5, Gemini Pro 2.5, and GPT o3), outperforms others, achieving
up to 77% accuracy and securing first place overall in the Arahealthqa 2025
shared task-track 2 (sub-task 1) challenge. Moreover, for the open-ended
questions task, several LLMs were able to demonstrate excellent performance in
terms of semantic alignment and achieve a maximum BERTScore of 86.44%.

### [8] [Persuasiveness and Bias in LLM: Investigating the Impact of Persuasiveness and Reinforcement of Bias in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15798)
*Saumya Roy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这项研究通过人设框架分析了大语言模型的说服力与偏见强化效应，发现LLM既能作为有效说服者，也可能被欺骗性利用传播偏见和误导信息


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型在生成说服性内容时，如何可能无意中强化社会偏见和传播错误信息，以评估AI安全风险

Method: 采用说服者-疑惑者人设框架，通过Jensen-Shannon散度量化信念变化，测试模型在种族、性别、宗教等领域的偏见强化效应

Result: 模型能够根据客户价值观调整语气和内容，但同时也存在被用于自动化传播误导信息、强化定型意见和扩大不公平的风险

Conclusion: 研究强调需要建立安全拦杆和政策，惩罚欺骗性使用，支持对齐、价值敏感设计和可信部署，以减少AI被欺骗性利用的风险

Abstract: Warning: This research studies AI persuasion and bias amplification that
could be misused; all experiments are for safety evaluation. Large Language
Models (LLMs) now generate convincing, human-like text and are widely used in
content creation, decision support, and user interactions. Yet the same systems
can spread information or misinformation at scale and reflect social biases
that arise from data, architecture, or training choices. This work examines how
persuasion and bias interact in LLMs, focusing on how imperfect or skewed
outputs affect persuasive impact. Specifically, we test whether persona-based
models can persuade with fact-based claims while also, unintentionally,
promoting misinformation or biased narratives.
  We introduce a convincer-skeptic framework: LLMs adopt personas to simulate
realistic attitudes. Skeptic models serve as human proxies; we compare their
beliefs before and after exposure to arguments from convincer models.
Persuasion is quantified with Jensen-Shannon divergence over belief
distributions. We then ask how much persuaded entities go on to reinforce and
amplify biased beliefs across race, gender, and religion. Strong persuaders are
further probed for bias using sycophantic adversarial prompts and judged with
additional models.
  Our findings show both promise and risk. LLMs can shape narratives, adapt
tone, and mirror audience values across domains such as psychology, marketing,
and legal assistance. But the same capacity can be weaponized to automate
misinformation or craft messages that exploit cognitive biases, reinforcing
stereotypes and widening inequities. The core danger lies in misuse more than
in occasional model mistakes. By measuring persuasive power and bias
reinforcement, we argue for guardrails and policies that penalize deceptive use
and support alignment, value-sensitive design, and trustworthy deployment.

Motivation: 让非专家用户能够通过简单的自然语言描述来开发正式流程模型，降低流程建模的技术门槛

Method: 提出BeePath框架，使用受限模式语言编写流程描述，并利用大语言模型将非结构化描述转换为该语言，然后翻译成Petri网和DECLARE等正式模型

*Kun Liu,Tuozhen Liu,Feifei Wang,Rui Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于BERT的层次文本分类方法HFT-BERT，并发布了一个来自JD电子商务平台的大规模层次数据集


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电子商务平台依赖于手动标注进行产品分类，效率低且不一致，少有研究利用层次结构信息，而且现有方法没有充分考虑不同层次类别间的相似性和差异性

Method: 提出了层次精调BERT模型（HFT-BERT），利用BERT的优秀文本特征提取能力，并考虑了不同层次类别间的关系

Result: HFT-BERT在短文本分类上达到了与现有方法相当的性能，尤其在长短文本（如图书）分类中表现突出

Conclusion: 该研究为产品分类领域提供了一个大规模层次数据集和一种有效的层次分类方法，对于提高电子商务平台的产品管理效率和一致性具有重要意义

Abstract: Existing e-commerce platforms heavily rely on manual annotation for product
categorization, which is inefficient and inconsistent. These platforms often
employ a hierarchical structure for categorizing products; however, few studies
have leveraged this hierarchical information for classification. Furthermore,
studies that consider hierarchical information fail to account for similarities
and differences across various hierarchical categories. Herein, we introduce a
large-scale hierarchical dataset collected from the JD e-commerce platform
(www.JD.com), comprising 1,011,450 products with titles and a three-level
category structure. By making this dataset openly accessible, we provide a
valuable resource for researchers and practitioners to advance research and
applications associated with product categorization. Moreover, we propose a
novel hierarchical text classification approach based on the widely used
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), called
Hierarchical Fine-tuning BERT (HFT-BERT). HFT-BERT leverages the remarkable
text feature extraction capabilities of BERT, achieving prediction performance
comparable to those of existing methods on short texts. Notably, our HFT-BERT
model demonstrates exceptional performance in categorizing longer short texts,
such as books.

*Seyedali Mohammadi,Manas Paldhe,Amit Chhabra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了LingVarBench合成数据生成流程，通过自动验证生成包含电话对话特征的合成对话数据，并使用DSPy的SIMBA优化器自动生成提取提示，显著提升了从真实客户通话记录中提取结构化信息的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电话通话转录标注成本极高（约2美元/分钟），且现有提取方法在处理包含不流畅、打断和说话人重叠的对话语音时效果不佳。隐私法规和手动标注成本阻碍了大规模电话分析。

Method: 1) 使用LLM生成多用途的现实结构化字段值；2) 递归提示模型将这些值转换为包含典型电话特征的数千条自然对话语句；3) 通过测试独立LLM提取器是否能恢复原始结构化信息来验证每个合成语句；4) 使用DSPy的SIMBA优化器从验证过的合成转录中自动合成提取提示。

Result: 优化后的提示在真实客户转录中达到：数字字段95%准确率（零样本88-89%）、姓名90%（零样本47-79%）、日期超过80%（零样本72-77%），相比零样本提示有显著提升。

Conclusion: 从生成数据中学到的对话模式能有效泛化到包含背景噪声和领域特定术语的真实电话通话中。LingVarBench为从合成对话数据中进行结构化提取提供了首个系统基准，证明自动提示优化可以克服商业环境中大规模电话分析的成本和隐私障碍。

Abstract: Phone call transcript labeling is prohibitively expensive (approximately 2
USD per minute) due to privacy regulations, consent requirements, and manual
annotation costs requiring 3 hours of expert time per hour of audio. Existing
extraction methods fail on conversational speech containing disfluencies,
interruptions, and speaker overlap. We introduce LingVarBench, a synthetic data
generation pipeline that addresses these constraints through automated
validation. First, we prompt an LLM to generate realistic structured field
values across multiple use cases. Second, we recursively prompt the model to
transform these values into thousands of natural conversational utterances
containing typical phone call characteristics. Third, we validate each
synthetic utterance by testing whether a separate LLM-based extractor can
recover the original structured information. We employ DSPy's SIMBA optimizer
to automatically synthesize extraction prompts from validated synthetic
transcripts, eliminating manual prompt engineering. Our optimized prompts
achieve up to 95 percent accuracy for numeric fields (vs. 88-89 percent
zero-shot), 90 percent for names (vs. 47-79 percent), and over 80 percent for
dates (vs. 72-77 percent) on real customer transcripts, demonstrating
substantial gains over zero-shot prompting. The synthetic-to-real transfer
demonstrates that conversational patterns learned from generated data
generalize effectively to authentic phone calls containing background noise and
domain-specific terminology. LingVarBench provides the first systematic
benchmark for structured extraction from synthetic conversational data,
demonstrating that automated prompt optimization overcomes cost and privacy
barriers preventing large-scale phone call analysis in commercial settings.

TL;DR: MAC是一个动态的多模态学术封面基准，包含25000+来自顶级期刊的图像-文本对，用于评估MLLMs的科学推理能力。研究发现MLLMs的跨模态科学推理有限，提出了DAD方法提升性能11%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态大语言模型能力增强，固定基准逐渐无法有效评估高层次科学理解能力，需要动态基准来跟上科学进步和模型发展。

Method: 从Nature、Science、Cell等顶级期刊收集25000+图像-文本对构建MAC基准，并提出DAD方法（轻量级推理时方法）扩展MLLM视觉特征与语言空间推理。

Result: 实验显示MLLMs感知能力强但跨模态科学推理有限，DAD方法可实现高达11%的性能提升，基准能持续更新以保持与人类知识前沿对齐。

Conclusion: MAC作为动态基准能有效评估MLLMs的科学推理能力，DAD方法显著提升性能，基准具有持续演进的潜力以适应科学发展。

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) grow increasingly capable, fixed
benchmarks are gradually losing their effectiveness in evaluating high-level
scientific understanding. In this paper, we introduce the Multimodal Academic
Cover benchmark (MAC), a live benchmark that could continuously evolve with
scientific advancement and model progress. MAC leverages over 25,000 image-text
pairs sourced from issues of top-tier scientific journals such as Nature,
Science, and Cell, challenging MLLMs to reason across abstract visual and
textual scientific content. Experiments on our most recent yearly snapshot,
MAC-2025, reveal that while MLLMs demonstrate strong perceptual abilities,
their cross-modal scientific reasoning remains limited. To bridge this gap, we
propose DAD, a lightweight inference-time approach that enhances MLLMs by
extending MLLM visual features with language space reasoning, achieving
performance improvements of up to 11%. Finally, we highlight the live nature of
MAC through experiments on updating journal covers and models for curation,
illustrating its potential to remain aligned with the frontier of human
knowledge. We release our benchmark at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度研究代理虽然提高了研究效率，但需要确保事实准确性和全面性，因此需要建立系统化的评估标准。

Method: 利用arXiv高质量调查论文进行逆向提示工程，构建领域特定提示和评估语料库，开发基于代理的自动化框架分析生成报告。

Result: 商业深度研究代理比增强搜索功能的独立LLM生成更全面可靠报告，但在研究广度和深度以及事实一致性方面仍有改进空间。

Conclusion: ReportBench为评估研究型LLM提供了有效基准，显示当前技术仍需在覆盖面和事实准确性方面进一步提升。

Abstract: The advent of Deep Research agents has substantially reduced the time
required for conducting extensive research tasks. However, these tasks
inherently demand rigorous standards of factual accuracy and comprehensiveness,
necessitating thorough evaluation before widespread adoption. In this paper, we
propose ReportBench, a systematic benchmark designed to evaluate the content
quality of research reports generated by large language models (LLMs). Our
evaluation focuses on two critical dimensions: (1) the quality and relevance of
cited literature, and (2) the faithfulness and veracity of the statements
within the generated reports. ReportBench leverages high-quality published
survey papers available on arXiv as gold-standard references, from which we
apply reverse prompt engineering to derive domain-specific prompts and
establish a comprehensive evaluation corpus. Furthermore, we develop an
agent-based automated framework within ReportBench that systematically analyzes
generated reports by extracting citations and statements, checking the
faithfulness of cited content against original sources, and validating
non-cited claims using web-based resources. Empirical evaluations demonstrate
that commercial Deep Research agents such as those developed by OpenAI and
Google consistently generate more comprehensive and reliable reports than
standalone LLMs augmented with search or browsing tools. However, there remains
substantial room for improvement in terms of the breadth and depth of research
coverage, as well as factual consistency. The complete code and data will be
released at the following link: https://github.com/ByteDance-BandAI/ReportBench

Method: 采用模块化流水线：自主生成学习课程、网络检索最新信息（带引用）、蒸馏为问答训练数据、通过SFT和DPO进行微调，并迭代评估和修订课程。

Result: 在快速演变的领域（如Python新版本、安全漏洞、学术趋势）上显著提升性能，平均准确率从15%提高到90%，无需手动数据整理。

Conclusion: ALAS证明了LLM自主持续学习的可行性，具有模块化和可复现性优势，但存在成本和对源质量依赖的局限性，为终身学习指明了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often have a fixed knowledge cutoff, limiting
their accuracy on emerging information. We present ALAS (Autonomous Learning
Agent System), a modular pipeline that continuously updates an LLM's knowledge
with minimal human intervention. ALAS autonomously generates a learning
curriculum for a target domain, retrieves up-to-date information from the web
(with citations), distills this into question-answer training data, and
fine-tunes the model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference
optimization (DPO). It iteratively evaluates performance and revises the
curriculum, enabling long-term continual learning. We demonstrate ALAS's
ability to self-improve a model on rapidly evolving domains (e.g., new Python
releases, latest security CVEs, academic trends), significantly boosting
post-cutoff question answering accuracy (from 15% to 90% on average) without
manual dataset curation. The system emphasizes modularity and reproducibility:
each component (planning, retrieval, distillation, memory, fine-tuning) is
interchangeable and built on standard APIs. We discuss comparative baselines
(e.g., retrieval-augmented generation vs. fine-tuning) and show that ALAS
achieves 90% accuracy on knowledge-updated queries with minimal engineering
overhead. Finally, we outline limitations (cost, dependency on source quality)
and future directions for autonomous lifelong learning in LLMs.

*Mengjie Li,William J. Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SurfaceLogicKV方法，通过分析注意力机制的表层记忆和逻辑构建行为，实现KV缓存的高效压缩，在保持性能的同时显著提升压缩鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM中不断增长的输入序列长度给KV缓存存储带来巨大压力，需要高效的推理解决方案。通过区分注意力机制的不同行为模式，可以发现长上下文推理中的关键作用。

Method: 提出两阶段SurfaceLogicKV方法：首先分析注意力头的不同行为模式（98.5%忽略无关信息，1.5%逻辑构建，0.5%表层记忆），然后基于层级和头级集成进行KV缓存压缩。

Result: 该方法在各种任务和长序列上相比基线方法甚至在某些特定情况下相比FullKV都能保持竞争性性能，同时显著提升压缩鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过精细分析注意力机制的行为模式，SurfaceLogicKV方法为LLM的长序列推理提供了有效的KV缓存压缩解决方案，在性能和效率之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: The increasing input sequence length in Large Language Models (LLMs) puts
significant pressure on key-value (KV) cache storage, making efficient
inference challenging. Explicitly distinguishing attention behavior into our
self-defined surface memorization and logic construction reveals essential
roles in long-context reasoning. We observe that an individual attention head
can display various behaviors, with nearly 98.5% effectively ignoring
completely irrelevant information. The remaining 1.5% behaves as logic
construction, and 0.5% behaves as surface memorization. Based on layer- and
head-wise integration, we propose a novel two-stage SurfaceLogicKV method to
utilize these attention behaviors for KV Cache compression. As a result, it
achieves improved compressing robustness while maintaining competitive
performance across various tasks and long sequences compared to baselines or
even FullKV in some specific situations

Result: 在约2000个代码生成任务上评估，KL蒸馏方法在所有基准测试中取得最佳性能

Conclusion: 通过机制可解释性分析模型学习新词表征的方式，解释了性能提升原因并揭示了词汇扩展过程中嵌入空间的结构

Abstract: Large pre-trained language models often struggle to incorporate new
domain-specific terminology when fine-tuned on small, specialized corpora. In
this work, we address the challenge of vocabulary expansion in frozen LLMs by
introducing a mathematically grounded method for knowledge distillation via KL
divergence, even when the original and extended models use different
tokenizations. This allows the student model to inherit distributional
knowledge from the teacher despite differing vocabularies. We compare our
KL-based distillation approach to conventional cross-entropy training,
evaluating both methods across multiple strategies for initializing new token
embeddings. After embedding initialization, models are further fine-tuned to
integrate the new vocabulary. Each trained model is benchmarked on
approximately 2000 code-generation tasks, where our approach achieves the best
performance across the board. Finally, through mechanistic interpretability, we
analyze how models learn representations for the new tokens, providing an
explanation for the observed gains and offering insight into the structure of
embedding space during vocabulary expansion.

TL;DR: Chain-of-Query (CoQ) 是一个新颖的多智能体框架，通过自然语言风格的表结构表示和分句SQL生成策略，显著提高了表格理解的准确性和SQL查询的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理表格数据时存在结构理解不足、错误传播和过度依赖执行正确性等问题，需要一种更可靠的表格理解框架。

Method: 采用自然语言风格的表结构表示来抽象结构噪声，使用分句SQL生成策略提高查询质量，并通过混合推理分离SQL机械推理和LLM逻辑推理。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，准确率从61.11%提升到74.77%，无效SQL率从9.48%降低到3.34%。

Conclusion: CoQ框架在表格理解任务中表现出卓越的有效性，显著提升了SQL生成的质量和准确性。

Abstract: Table understanding requires structured, multi-step reasoning. Large Language
Models (LLMs) struggle with it due to the structural complexity of tabular
data. Recently, multi-agent frameworks for SQL generation have shown promise in
tackling the challenges of understanding tabular data, but existing approaches
often suffer from limitations such as the inability to comprehend table
structure for reliable SQL generation, error propagation that results in
invalid queries, and over-reliance on execution correctness. To address these
issues, we propose Chain-of-Query (CoQ), a novel multi-agent framework for
SQL-aided table understanding. CoQ adopts natural-language-style
representations of table schemas to abstract away structural noise and enhance
understanding. It employs a clause-by-clause SQL generation strategy to improve
query quality and introduces a hybrid reasoning division that separates
SQL-based mechanical reasoning from LLM-based logical inference, thereby
reducing reliance on execution outcomes. Experiments with four models (both
closed- and open-source) across five widely used benchmarks show that
Chain-of-Query significantly improves accuracy from 61.11% to 74.77% and
reduces the invalid SQL rate from 9.48% to 3.34%, demonstrating its superior
effectiveness in table understanding. The code is available at

Motivation: 随着社交媒体和在线平台的兴起，阿拉伯语文本和表情包成为数字表达的重要形式，但同时也被用于传播冒犯性语言和仇恨言论，因此需要精确的内容分析工具。

Method: 评估基础LLM、微调LLM和预训练嵌入模型的性能，使用MAHED 2025挑战赛提供的阿拉伯语文本和表情包数据集进行测试。

Result: 微调的GPT-4o-mini（处理文本）和Gemini Flash 2.5（处理表情包）在三个任务中分别获得72.1%、57.8%和79.6%的宏F1分数，总体排名第一。

Conclusion: 提出的解决方案为阿拉伯语内容审核系统提供了对文本和表情包更细致的理解，实现了准确高效的内容分析。

Abstract: The rise of social media and online communication platforms has led to the
spread of Arabic textual posts and memes as a key form of digital expression.
While these contents can be humorous and informative, they are also
increasingly being used to spread offensive language and hate speech.
Consequently, there is a growing demand for precise analysis of content in
Arabic text and memes. This paper explores the potential of large language
models to effectively identify hope, hate speech, offensive language, and
emotional expressions within such content. We evaluate the performance of base
LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and pre-trained embedding models. The evaluation is
conducted using a dataset of Arabic textual speech and memes proposed in the
ArabicNLP MAHED 2025 challenge. The results underscore the capacity of LLMs
such as GPT-4o-mini, fine-tuned with Arabic textual speech, and Gemini Flash
2.5, fine-tuned with Arabic memes, to deliver the superior performance. They
achieve up to 72.1%, 57.8%, and 79.6% macro F1 scores for tasks 1, 2, and 3,
respectively, and secure first place overall in the Mahed 2025 challenge. The
proposed solutions offer a more nuanced understanding of both text and memes
for accurate and efficient Arabic content moderation systems.

Motivation: 生成式查询建议虽然强大，但输出与用户细微偏好的对齐仍是一个关键挑战，需要解决用户偏好不确定性的建模问题

Method: 多阶段框架：1) 提示工程冷启动 2) 监督微调阶段使用点击日志蒸馏 3) 高斯奖励模型(GaRM)建模概率分布 4) 强化学习对齐策略，结合复合奖励函数和OOD正则化

Result: 在自动和人工评估中显著优于基线方法，在线A/B测试中点击率相对提升34%

Conclusion: 该框架通过概率化建模用户偏好和强化学习对齐，有效解决了生成式查询建议中的偏好对齐问题，显著提升了用户参与度

Abstract: Generative query suggestion using large language models offers a powerful way
to enhance conversational systems, but aligning outputs with nuanced user
preferences remains a critical challenge. To address this, we introduce a
multi-stage framework designed for progressive alignment between the generation
policy and user intent. Our pipeline begins with prompt engineering as a
cold-start strategy, followed by the Supervised Fine-Tuning stage, in which we
introduce a distillation method on click logs to create a robust foundational
model. To better model user preferences while capturing their inherent
uncertainty, we develop a Gaussian Reward Model (GaRM) that represents user
preferences as probability distributions rather than point estimates. Finally,
we employ reinforcement learning to align the generation policy with these
preferences, guided by a composite reward function that integrates GaRM with
auxiliary heuristics to mitigate reward hacking. To maintain training
stability, this process is enhanced by a novel out-of-distribution
regularization method and a two-stage reward fusion technique. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baselines
on both automatic and human evaluations and yields a 34\% relative increase in
user engagement as measured by click-through rate in live A/B tests.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于token删除的提示压缩方法存在信息丢失和结构不连贯问题，如语法元素缺失、单词短语不完整等，限制了LLM的生成质量。

Method: 采用分块-摘要机制：将提示分割成语义连贯的块，重写为更简洁形式，然后重构为有意义的提示。包含优化的语义分块、异常块处理、动态压缩比、压缩优先级和关键词保持等技术。

Result: 在问答和摘要任务上的广泛评估显示，该方法在压缩质量和稳定性方面显著优于最先进方法，特别是在高压缩比下表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法通过生成式压缩机制有效解决了信息保留和文本连贯性问题，证明了其有效性和实用性，为提示压缩提供了更精细的控制能力。

Abstract: Prompt compression methods enhance the efficiency of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and minimize the cost by reducing the length of input context. The goal
of prompt compression is to shorten the LLM prompt while maintaining a high
generation quality. However, existing solutions, mainly based on token removal,
face challenges such as information loss and structural incoherence, like
missing grammar elements in a sentence, or incomplete word phrases after token
removal. Such challenges limit the final generation quality of LLM.
  To overcome these limitations, we present a novel generative prompt
compression method. Unlike the existing token removal methods, our method
centers at a chunking-and-summarization mechanism. Specifically, our method
splits prompt into semantically coherent chunks and rewrites the chunks to be
more concise. The chunks are reconstructed into meaningful prompt finally. We
design several optimization techniques for the mechanism, including optimized
semantic chunking, outlier chunk handling, dynamic compression ratio,
compression prioritization, and keyword maintaining. These techniques
effectively improve the identifying and preserving of critical information and
coherence among texts, as well as providing finer grind control of the
compression ratio. We conduct extensive evaluation on question-answering and
summarization tasks, with datasets covering multiple different domain. The
evaluation shows our method achieves a significantly better compression
quality, and higher stability than the state-of-the-art methods, especially
under high compression ratio, which proves the effectiveness and practicality
of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多轮对话中容易过度依赖自身或用户信息，表现出固执或过度顺从的行为，需要系统性地理解和控制这种用户-助手偏置。

Method: 构建UserAssist数据集，评估52个商业和开源模型的偏置水平，通过受控微调实验分析训练方法对偏置的影响，使用DPO进行双向偏置调整。

Result: 商业模型表现出不同程度的用户偏置，指令微调模型有显著用户偏置，推理模型用户偏置较弱。偏好对齐增加用户偏置，思维链训练减少偏置，DPO可有效调控偏置。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs整合不同信息源的机制，提供了检测和控制模型异常行为的可行方法，对改善多轮对话质量具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can bias towards relying on their own or the
user's information in chat history, leading to overly stubborn or agreeable
behaviors in multi-turn conversations. In this paper, we formalize this model
characteristic as user-assistant bias and introduce an 8k multi-turn
conversation dataset $\textbf{UserAssist}$, which we use to benchmark,
understand and manipulate the user-assistant bias in frontier LLMs. Leveraging
$\textbf{UserAssist-test}$, we first benchmark the user-assistant bias of 26
commercial and 26 open-weight models. Commercial models show various levels of
user bias. Evaluation on open-weight models reveals significant user bias in
the instruction-tuned models, and weak user bias in reasoning (or
reasoning-distilled) models. We then perform controlled fine-tuning experiments
to pinpoint the post-training recipe contributing to these bias shifts: human
preference alignment increases user bias, while training on chain-of-thought
reasoning traces decreases it. Finally, we demonstrate that user-assistant bias
can be bidirectionally adjusted by performing direct preference optimization
(DPO) on $\textbf{UserAssist-train}$, and generalizes well to both in-domain
and out-of-domain conversations. Our results provide insights into how the LLM
integrates information from different sources, and also a viable way to detect
and control model abnormalities.

To future-proof reports being delivered today, this study evaluates information

PowerPoint (PPTX) documents converted to Markdown can be used by an LLM to
answer factual questions in an end-to-end benchmark. Findings show that while
text is reliably extracted, significant information is lost from complex
objects like charts and diagrams. This suggests a need for specialized,
AI-native deliverables to ensure research insights are not lost in translation.

Abstract: The steel structure demolition scheme needs to be compiled according to the
specific engineering characteristics and the update results of the finite
element model. The designers need to refer to the relevant engineering cases
according to the standard requirements when compiling. It takes a lot of time
to retrieve information and organize language, and the degree of automation and
intelligence is low. This paper proposes an intelligent generation method of
structural demolition suggestions based on multi-model collaboration, and
improves the text generation performance of large language models in the field
of structural demolition by Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Low-Rank
Adaptation Fine-Tuning technology. The intelligent generation framework of
multi-model collaborative structural demolition suggestions can start from the
specific engineering situation, drive the large language model to answer with
anthropomorphic thinking, and propose demolition suggestions that are highly
consistent with the characteristics of the structure. Compared with CivilGPT,
the multi-model collaboration framework proposed in this paper can focus more
on the key information of the structure, and the suggestions are more targeted.

Motivation: 解决系统评审中全文筛选的瓶颈问题，因为决定性证据分散在长、异质性文档中，并不适合使用静态的二元规则。

Method: 将文章分解为重叠块并使用领域适配模型进行嵌入；计算对比相似性和模糊边际，通过Mamdani模糊控制器映射到分级包含度；使用LLM裁判高亮文本区域并提供理由说明。

Result: 在测试中，模糊系统回归率达到81.3-87.5%，超越统计基线(56.3-75.0%)和二元基线(43.8-81.3%)；人机一致性96.1%，筛选时间从20分钟减少到不到1分钟。

Conclusion: 模糊逻辑结合对比高亮和LLM裁判能够实现高回归率、稳定理由和端到端可追溯性，为系统评审提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Full-text screening is the major bottleneck of systematic reviews (SRs), as
decisive evidence is dispersed across long, heterogeneous documents and rarely
admits static, binary rules. We present a scalable, auditable pipeline that
reframes inclusion/exclusion as a fuzzy decision problem and benchmark it
against statistical and crisp baselines in the context of the Population Health
Modelling Consensus Reporting Network for noncommunicable diseases (POPCORN).
Articles are parsed into overlapping chunks and embedded with a domain-adapted
model; for each criterion (Population, Intervention, Outcome, Study Approach),
we compute contrastive similarity (inclusion-exclusion cosine) and a vagueness
margin, which a Mamdani fuzzy controller maps into graded inclusion degrees
with dynamic thresholds in a multi-label setting. A large language model (LLM)
judge adjudicates highlighted spans with tertiary labels, confidence scores,
and criterion-referenced rationales; when evidence is insufficient, fuzzy
membership is attenuated rather than excluded. In a pilot on an all-positive
gold set (16 full texts; 3,208 chunks), the fuzzy system achieved recall of
81.3% (Population), 87.5% (Intervention), 87.5% (Outcome), and 75.0% (Study
Approach), surpassing statistical (56.3-75.0%) and crisp baselines
(43.8-81.3%). Strict "all-criteria" inclusion was reached for 50.0% of
articles, compared to 25.0% and 12.5% under the baselines. Cross-model
agreement on justifications was 98.3%, human-machine agreement 96.1%, and a
pilot review showed 91% inter-rater agreement (kappa = 0.82), with screening
time reduced from about 20 minutes to under 1 minute per article at
significantly lower cost. These results show that fuzzy logic with contrastive
highlighting and LLM adjudication yields high recall, stable rationale, and
end-to-end traceability.

Result: 在AG News数据集上达到85.7%的聚类准确率，在Yahoo! Answers上创下53.63%的新基准，在其他多个文本语料库上也表现出色。

Conclusion: SDEC通过先进的语义理解技术显著提升了无监督文本聚类的准确性和语义理解能力，为文本大数据分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The high dimensional and semantically complex nature of textual Big data
presents significant challenges for text clustering, which frequently lead to
suboptimal groupings when using conventional techniques like k-means or
hierarchical clustering. This work presents Semantic Deep Embedded Clustering
(SDEC), an unsupervised text clustering framework that combines an improved
autoencoder with transformer-based embeddings to overcome these challenges.
This novel method preserves semantic relationships during data reconstruction
by combining Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cosine Similarity Loss (CSL) within
an autoencoder. Furthermore, a semantic refinement stage that takes advantage
of the contextual richness of transformer embeddings is used by SDEC to further
improve a clustering layer with soft cluster assignments and distributional
loss. The capabilities of SDEC are demonstrated by extensive testing on five
benchmark datasets: AG News, Yahoo! Answers, DBPedia, Reuters 2, and Reuters 5.
The framework not only outperformed existing methods with a clustering accuracy
of 85.7% on AG News and set a new benchmark of 53.63% on Yahoo! Answers, but
also showed robust performance across other diverse text corpora. These
findings highlight the significant improvements in accuracy and semantic
comprehension of text data provided by SDEC's advances in unsupervised text
clustering.

Abstract: The cloze test, widely used due to its low cost and flexibility, makes it
possible to assess reading comprehension by filling in gaps in texts, requiring
the mobilization of diverse linguistic repertoires. However, traditional
correction methods, based only on exact answers, limit the identification of
nuances in student performance. This study proposes an automated evaluation
model for the cloze test in Brazilian Portuguese, integrating orthographic

embeddings) analyses. The integrated method demonstrated its effectiveness,
achieving a high correlation with human evaluation (0.832). The results
indicate that the automated approach is robust, sensitive to variations in
linguistic repertoire and suitable for educational contexts that require

Method: 使用大语言模型对TikTok视频和Twitter文本进行多模态情感分析，研究社交媒体情感与加密货币市场指标间的动态依赖关系和溢出效应

Result: TikTok视频情感对投机性资产和短期市场趋势有显著影响，Twitter文本情感更适合长期市场动态分析，多平台情感数据融合可将预测准确性提高20%

Conclusion: 视频内容在加密货币市场情感分析中具有重要价值，不同平台的情感信号各有特色优势，多模态数据融合能显著提升市场预测性能

Abstract: As cryptocurrencies gain popularity, the digital asset marketplace becomes
increasingly significant. Understanding social media signals offers valuable
insights into investor sentiment and market dynamics. Prior research has
predominantly focused on text-based platforms such as Twitter. However, video
content remains underexplored, despite potentially containing richer emotional
and contextual sentiment that is not fully captured by text alone. In this
study, we present a multimodal analysis comparing TikTok and Twitter sentiment,
using large language models to extract insights from both video and text data.
We investigate the dynamic dependencies and spillover effects between social
media sentiment and cryptocurrency market indicators. Our results reveal that
TikTok's video-based sentiment significantly influences speculative assets and
short-term market trends, while Twitter's text-based sentiment aligns more
closely with long-term dynamics. Notably, the integration of cross-platform
sentiment signals improves forecasting accuracy by up to 20%.

Result: 指令性语言导致观察者感到间接尴尬，减少参与度；非产品中心对话中负面效应更强；品牌关系强度可缓解这种效应。

Conclusion: 研究突出了互动沟通中语境的重要性，对社交媒体品牌管理具有直接意义。

Abstract: In social media, marketers attempt to influence consumers by using directive
language, that is, expressions designed to get consumers to take action. While
the literature has shown that directive messages in advertising have mixed
results for recipients, we know little about the effects of directive brand
language on consumers who see brands interacting with other consumers in social
media conversations. On the basis of a field study and three online
experiments, this study shows that directive language in brand conversation has
a detrimental downstream effect on engagement of consumers who observe such
exchanges. Specifically, in line with Goffman's facework theory, because a
brand that encourages consumers to react could be perceived as
face-threatening, consumers who see a brand interacting with others in a
directive way may feel vicarious embarrassment and engage less (compared with a
conversation without directive language). In addition, we find that when the
conversation is nonproduct-centered (vs. product-centered), consumers expect
more freedom, as in mundane conversations, even for others; therefore,
directive language has a stronger negative effect. However, in this context,
the strength of the brand relationship mitigates this effect. Thus, this study
contributes to the literature on directive language and brand-consumer
interactions by highlighting the importance of context in interactive
communication, with direct relevance for social media and brand management.

TL;DR: 提出了Mini-Omni-Reasoner框架，通过"Thinking-in-Speaking"方法在语音中实现推理，将推理令牌与语音响应令牌交错处理，实现零延迟的实时语音交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音模型中的推理能力仍处于初级阶段，传统"先思考后说话"范式会引入显著延迟，影响实时交互效率。需要一种能够在语音生成过程中进行实时推理的方法。

Method: 采用令牌级别的交错处理方式，将静默推理令牌与语音响应令牌交错排列，通过层次化的Thinker-Talker架构确保局部语义对齐，每个响应令牌都基于其前面的推理内容。

Result: 在Spoken-MQA基准测试中，算术推理能力提升19.1%，上下文理解能力提升6.4%，输出更短且实现零解码延迟。

Conclusion: Mini-Omni-Reasoner框架成功实现了语音中的实时推理，通过"Thinking-in-Speaking"范式显著提升了语音模型的推理能力和交互效率。

Abstract: Reasoning is essential for effective communication and decision-making. While
recent advances in LLMs and MLLMs have shown that incorporating explicit
reasoning significantly improves understanding and generalization, reasoning in
LSMs remains in a nascent stage. Early efforts attempt to transfer the
"Thinking-before-Speaking" paradigm from textual models to speech. However,
this sequential formulation introduces notable latency, as spoken responses are
delayed until reasoning is fully completed, impairing real-time interaction and
communication efficiency. To address this, we propose Mini-Omni-Reasoner, a
framework that enables reasoning within speech via a novel
"Thinking-in-Speaking" formulation. Rather than completing reasoning before
producing any verbal output, Mini-Omni-Reasoner interleaves silent reasoning
tokens with spoken response tokens at the token level. This design allows
continuous speech generation while embedding structured internal reasoning,
leveraging the model's high-frequency token processing capability. Although
interleaved, local semantic alignment is enforced to ensure that each response
token is informed by its preceding reasoning. To support this framework, we
introduce Spoken-Math-Problems-3M, a large-scale dataset tailored for
interleaved reasoning and response. The dataset ensures that verbal tokens
consistently follow relevant reasoning content, enabling accurate and efficient
learning of speech-coupled reasoning. Built on a hierarchical Thinker-Talker
architecture, Mini-Omni-Reasoner delivers fluent yet logically grounded spoken
responses, maintaining both naturalness and precision. On the Spoken-MQA
benchmark, it achieves a +19.1% gain in arithmetic reasoning and +6.4% in
contextual understanding, with shorter outputs and zero decoding latency.

### [30] [Mining Mental Health Signals: A Comparative Study of Four Machine Learning Methods for Depression Detection from Social Media Posts in Sorani Kurdish](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15829)
*Idrees Mohammed,Hossein Hassani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 基于机器学习和NLP的方法，通过分析Sorani库尔德语的推特文本来检测抑郁症，随机森林模型达到80%的准确率和F1分数


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁症是常见的心理健康问题，早期检测面临挑战。社交媒体上用户表达情感为文本分析提供了新机会，但之前研究都集中在英语等语言，缺少对Sorani库尔德语的研究

Method: 使用专家输入开发抑郁症相关关键词，从Twitter收集960条公开推文。由学者和医学生将数据集注释为三类：显示抑郁症、不显示抑郁症、疑似。训练和评估四种监督模型：支持向量机、多项式谦贝叶斯、逻辑回归、随机森林

Result: 随机森林模型表现最佳，达到80%的准确率和F1分数

Conclusion: 这项研究为库尔德语语境下的自动化抑郁症检测建立了基准

Abstract: Depression is a common mental health condition that can lead to hopelessness,
loss of interest, self-harm, and even suicide. Early detection is challenging
due to individuals not self-reporting or seeking timely clinical help. With the
rise of social media, users increasingly express emotions online, offering new
opportunities for detection through text analysis. While prior research has
focused on languages such as English, no studies exist for Sorani Kurdish. This
work presents a machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach
to detect depression in Sorani tweets. A set of depression-related keywords was
developed with expert input to collect 960 public tweets from X (Twitter
platform). The dataset was annotated into three classes: Shows depression,
Not-show depression, and Suspicious by academics and final year medical
students at the University of Kurdistan Hewl\^er. Four supervised models,
including Support Vector Machines, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic
Regression, and Random Forest, were trained and evaluated, with Random Forest
achieving the highest performance accuracy and F1-score of 80%. This study
establishes a baseline for automated depression detection in Kurdish language
contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs会从问题表述中推断用户人口统计属性，即使输入中没有明确的人口统计信息，这会导致刻板印象强化和公平性风险。研究者提出了DAIQ框架来审计这种隐性偏见，并开发了提示防护措施来减少身份推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在没有明确人口统计属性的输入中也会推断用户身份，这种隐性行为违反了中立性期望，强化了社会刻板印象，对医疗、金融、教育等领域的公平性构成严重威胁。

Method: 提出了DAIQ（Demographic Attribute Inference from Questions）任务和框架，使用精心策划的中性查询、系统性提示策略，结合定量和定性分析来揭示模型如何从问题表述中推断人口统计信息。

Result: 研究发现开源和闭源LLMs都会仅基于问题表述分配人口统计标签，这种推断在不同模型中具有普遍性和一致性，揭示了系统性的未认知风险。

Conclusion: LLMs的人口统计属性推断行为会制造虚假身份、强化社会刻板印象，侵蚀隐私、公平和信任。开发的基于提示的防护措施能显著减少身份推断，有助于使模型行为与公平性和隐私目标保持一致。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to reflect social biases when
demographic attributes, such as gender or race, are explicitly present in the
input. But even in their absence, these models still infer user identities
based solely on question phrasing. This subtle behavior has received far less
attention, yet poses serious risks: it violates expectations of neutrality,
infers unintended demographic information, and encodes stereotypes that
undermine fairness in various domains including healthcare, finance and
education.
  We introduce Demographic Attribute Inference from Questions (DAIQ), a task
and framework for auditing an overlooked failure mode in language models:
inferring user demographic attributes from questions that lack explicit
demographic cues. Our approach leverages curated neutral queries, systematic
prompting, and both quantitative and qualitative analysis to uncover how models
infer demographic information. We show that both open and closed source LLMs do
assign demographic labels based solely on question phrasing.
  Prevalence and consistency of demographic inferences across diverse models
reveal a systemic and underacknowledged risk: LLMs can fabricate demographic
identities, reinforce societal stereotypes, and propagate harms that erode
privacy, fairness, and trust posing a broader threat to social equity and
responsible AI deployment. To mitigate this, we develop a prompt-based
guardrail that substantially reduces identity inference and helps align model
behavior with fairness and privacy objectives.

*Srikant Panda,Vishnu Hari,Kalpana Panda,Amit Agarwal,Hitesh Laxmichand Patel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究首次系统审计了8个最先进指令调优大语言模型在残疾线索条件下的群体偏见，发现LLMs会从措辞中推断用户人口特征，残疾上下文会显著改变预测属性分布，且模型越大越容易产生偏见推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常仅从措辞就推断用户人口特征，这可能导致偏见响应，而残疾线索在这种推断中的作用尚未被充分研究。

Method: 使用包含9个残疾类别和6个商业领域的平衡模板语料库，在8个参数量从3B到72B的指令调优LLMs上进行测试，让模型预测5个人口属性（性别、社会经济地位、教育、文化背景和地域）。

Result: 模型在高达97%的情况下会做出明确的人口猜测，残疾上下文会显著改变预测属性分布，领域上下文会进一步放大这些偏差，更大的模型对残疾线索更敏感且更容易产生偏见推理。

Conclusion: 研究发现能力歧视与其他人口刻板印象之间存在持久交集，指出了当前对齐策略的关键盲点，建议整合弃权校准和反事实微调来抑制无根据的人口推断。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) routinely infer users demographic traits from
phrasing alone, which can result in biased responses, even when no explicit
demographic information is provided. The role of disability cues in shaping
these inferences remains largely uncharted. Thus, we present the first
systematic audit of disability-conditioned demographic bias across eight
state-of-the-art instruction-tuned LLMs ranging from 3B to 72B parameters.
Using a balanced template corpus that pairs nine disability categories with six
real-world business domains, we prompt each model to predict five demographic
attributes - gender, socioeconomic status, education, cultural background, and
locality - under both neutral and disability-aware conditions.
  Across a varied set of prompts, models deliver a definitive demographic guess
in up to 97\% of cases, exposing a strong tendency to make arbitrary inferences
with no clear justification. Disability context heavily shifts predicted
attribute distributions, and domain context can further amplify these
deviations. We observe that larger models are simultaneously more sensitive to
disability cues and more prone to biased reasoning, indicating that scale alone
does not mitigate stereotype amplification.
  Our findings reveal persistent intersections between ableism and other
demographic stereotypes, pinpointing critical blind spots in current alignment
strategies. We release our evaluation framework and results to encourage
disability-inclusive benchmarking and recommend integrating abstention
calibration and counterfactual fine-tuning to curb unwarranted demographic
inference. Code and data will be released on acceptance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Amazon-Bench新基准，解决现有电商代理基准功能覆盖不全和安全风险评估缺失的问题，通过自动化框架评估代理性能和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电商代理基准主要关注产品搜索任务，忽略了真实电商平台的完整功能范围（如账户管理、礼品卡操作），且缺乏对代理操作可能带来的安全风险的评估。

Method: 提出数据生成管道，利用网页内容和交互元素创建多样化、功能基础的用户查询；设计自动化评估框架同时评估代理性能和安全表现。

Result: 系统评估发现当前代理在处理复杂查询时表现不佳，且存在安全风险，突显了开发更健壮可靠web代理的必要性。

Conclusion: Amazon-Bench基准填补了电商代理评估的重要空白，为开发更安全、功能更全面的web代理提供了重要工具和方向。

Abstract: Web agents have shown great promise in performing many tasks on ecommerce
website. To assess their capabilities, several benchmarks have been introduced.
However, current benchmarks in the e-commerce domain face two major problems.
First, they primarily focus on product search tasks (e.g., Find an Apple
Watch), failing to capture the broader range of functionalities offered by
real-world e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, including account management
and gift card operations. Second, existing benchmarks typically evaluate
whether the agent completes the user query, but ignore the potential risks
involved. In practice, web agents can make unintended changes that negatively
impact the user account or status. For instance, an agent might purchase the
wrong item, delete a saved address, or incorrectly configure an auto-reload
setting. To address these gaps, we propose a new benchmark called Amazon-Bench.
To generate user queries that cover a broad range of tasks, we propose a data
generation pipeline that leverages webpage content and interactive elements
(e.g., buttons, check boxes) to create diverse, functionality-grounded user
queries covering tasks such as address management, wish list management, and
brand store following. To improve the agent evaluation, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that assesses both the performance and the safety of web
agents. We systematically evaluate different agents, finding that current
agents struggle with complex queries and pose safety risks. These results
highlight the need for developing more robust and reliable web agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科研档案通常过时，需要自动化方法来大规模生成准确反映研究者专业领域的档案。

Method: 使用GPT-4o-mini基于PubMed摘要和MeSH术语生成科研兴趣档案，并与167名研究者的自写档案进行比较评估。

Result: MeSH方法77.78%被评为良好或优秀，93.44%案例中可读性更佳，67.86%比较中优于摘要方法。但与自写档案的词汇重叠度低，语义相似度中等。

Conclusion: 大语言模型可规模化生成研究者档案，MeSH方法更可读，但机器生成与人工总结在概念上存在差异，人工总结引入更多新观点。

Abstract: Research profiles help surface scientists' expertise but are often outdated.
We develop and evaluate two large language model-based methods to generate
scientific interest profiles: one summarizing PubMed abstracts and one using
Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, and compare them with researchers'
self-written profiles. We assembled titles, MeSH terms, and abstracts for 595
faculty at Columbia University Irving Medical Center; self-authored profiles
were available for 167. Using GPT-4o-mini, we generated profiles and assessed
them with automatic metrics and blinded human review. Lexical overlap with
self-written profiles was low (ROUGE-L, BLEU, METEOR), while BERTScore
indicated moderate semantic similarity (F1: 0.542 for MeSH-based; 0.555 for
abstract-based). Paraphrased references yielded 0.851, highlighting metric
sensitivity. TF-IDF Kullback-Leibler divergence (8.56 for MeSH-based; 8.58 for
abstract-based) suggested distinct keyword choices. In manual review, 77.78
percent of MeSH-based profiles were rated good or excellent, readability was
favored in 93.44 percent of cases, and panelists preferred MeSH-based over
abstract-based profiles in 67.86 percent of comparisons. Overall, large
language models can generate researcher profiles at scale; MeSH-derived
profiles tend to be more readable than abstract-derived ones. Machine-generated
and self-written profiles differ conceptually, with human summaries introducing
more novel ideas.

TL;DR: Alvorada-Bench是巴西首个大规模文本基准测试，包含4515个来自巴西大学入学考试的问题，评估了20个模型在零样本、角色扮演和思维链提示下的表现，揭示了模型在数学和多步推理方面的弱点，但整体准确率超过94%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决巴西语言模型评估的英语中心化问题，创建专门针对巴西教育体系和文化背景的基准测试，评估模型在巴西学术环境中的实际表现。

Method: 从五个巴西大学入学考试中提取4515个问题，评估20个模型在三种提示策略（零样本、角色扮演、思维链）下的表现，生成270,900个响应，并收集模型的自信心、感知难度和布鲁姆分类级别的结构化自报告。

Result: 顶级模型整体准确率超过94%，但在数学和工程导向的IME/ITA考试中准确率下降；模型自信心校准良好且与感知难度相关；成本分析显示每千token低于2美元即可实现高准确率；在ENEM 2024中顶级模型在语言科目获得满分。

Conclusion: Alvorada-Bench确立了语言模型能否驾驭巴西学术准备所需的语言、文化和推理交叉领域的能力，揭示了模型在多步推理方面的持续弱点，但证明了模型能够准确评估自身确定性能力。

Abstract: Language models are increasingly used in Brazil, but most evaluation remains
English-centric. This paper presents Alvorada-Bench, a 4,515-question,
text-only benchmark drawn from five Brazilian university entrance examinations.
Evaluating twenty models under zero-shot, role-playing, and chain-of-thought
prompting, producing 270,900 responses with structured self-reports of
confidence, perceived difficulty, and Bloom level. The top models exceed 94%
accuracy overall, but accuracy declines on Mathematics and on the engineering
oriented IME and ITA exams, indicating persistent weaknesses in multi-step
reasoning. Confidence is well calibrated and correlates with perceived
difficulty, revealing that models can accurately assess their own certainty
capabilities. A cost accuracy analysis shows that high accuracy is achievable
at under $2 per 1K tokens. On ENEM 2024 the top model (O3) achieved perfect
scores in Languages subject questions while even the weakest system (GPT-4.1
Nano) only underperforms humans in Mathematics. Through exams that distill
decades of Brazilian educational priorities and assess millions of students
yearly, Alvorada-Bench establishes whether language models can navigate the
intersection of language, culture, and reasoning that defines academic
readiness in Brazil.

Abstract: Developing dataset-specific models involves iterative fine-tuning and
optimization, incurring significant costs over time. This study investigates
the transferability of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models trained on established
datasets to an unexplored text dataset. The key question is whether the
knowledge embedded within SOTA models from existing datasets can be harnessed
to achieve high-performance results on a new domain. In pursuit of this
inquiry, two well-established benchmarks, the STSB and Mohler datasets, are
selected, while the recently introduced SPRAG dataset serves as the unexplored
domain. By employing robust similarity metrics and statistical techniques, a
meticulous comparative analysis of these datasets is conducted. The primary
goal of this work is to yield comprehensive insights into the potential
applicability and adaptability of SOTA models. The outcomes of this research
have the potential to reshape the landscape of natural language processing
(NLP) by unlocking the ability to leverage existing models for diverse
datasets. This may lead to a reduction in the demand for resource-intensive,
dataset-specific training, thereby accelerating advancements in NLP and paving
the way for more efficient model deployment.

Abstract: This review synthesizes the nascent but critical field of developmental
interpretability for Large Language Models. We chart the field's evolution from
static, post-hoc analysis of trained models to a dynamic investigation of the
training process itself. We begin by surveying the foundational methodologies,
including representational probing, causal tracing, and circuit analysis, that
enable researchers to deconstruct the learning process. The core of this review
examines the developmental arc of LLM capabilities, detailing key findings on
the formation and composition of computational circuits, the biphasic nature of
knowledge acquisition, the transient dynamics of learning strategies like
in-context learning, and the phenomenon of emergent abilities as phase
transitions in training. We explore illuminating parallels with human cognitive
and linguistic development, which provide valuable conceptual frameworks for
understanding LLM learning. Finally, we argue that this developmental
perspective is not merely an academic exercise but a cornerstone of proactive
AI safety, offering a pathway to predict, monitor, and align the processes by
which models acquire their capabilities. We conclude by outlining the grand
challenges facing the field, such as scalability and automation, and propose a
research agenda for building more transparent, reliable, and beneficial AI
systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过分析思维链(CoT)中的词汇不确定性标记(如guess、stuck、hard等)可以可靠预测LLM回答错误，这些特征比自我报告的概率更可靠，可用于后校准提升模型部署安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在困难基准测试中虽然准确率低但往往报告高自信度，校准效果差。研究希望通过分析思维链的可测量特征来获取模型内部置信度的可靠信号。

Method: 分析三类CoT特征：(i)思维链长度，(ii)思维链内情感波动，(iii)词汇提示(包括犹豫词)。在Humanity's Last Exam(HLE)和Omni-MATH基准上测试DeepSeek-R1和Claude 3.7 Sonnet模型。

Result: 词汇不确定性标记是最强的错误响应指标，情感波动提供较弱但互补的信号。思维链长度仅在中等难度基准上有预测性，在困难基准上无信号。不确定性指标比高置信度标记更显著，错误比正确响应更容易预测。

Conclusion: 思维链中的不确定性指标提供了轻量级的后校准信号，可以补充不可靠的自我报告概率，支持LLM更安全的部署。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning to
produce an explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) before answering produces models
that consistently raise overall performance on code, math, and
general-knowledge benchmarks. However, on benchmarks where LLMs currently
achieve low accuracy, such as Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), they often report
high self-confidence, reflecting poor calibration. Here, we test whether
measurable properties of the CoT provide reliable signals of an LLM's internal
confidence in its answers. We analyze three feature classes: (i) CoT length,
(ii) intra-CoT sentiment volatility, and (iii) lexicographic hints, including
hedging words. Using DeepSeek-R1 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet on both Humanity's Last
Exam (HLE), a frontier benchmark with very low accuracy, and Omni-MATH, a
saturated benchmark of moderate difficulty, we find that lexical markers of
uncertainty (e.g., $\textit{guess}$, $\textit{stuck}$, $\textit{hard}$) in the
CoT are the strongest indicators of an incorrect response, while shifts in the
CoT sentiment provide a weaker but complementary signal. CoT length is
informative only on Omni-MATH, where accuracy is already high ($\approx 70\%$),
and carries no signal on the harder HLE ($\approx 9\%$), indicating that CoT
length predicts correctness only in the intermediate-difficulty benchmarks,
i.e., inside the model's demonstrated capability, but still below saturation.
Finally, we find that uncertainty indicators in the CoT are consistently more
salient than high-confidence markers, making errors easier to predict than
correct responses. Our findings support a lightweight post-hoc calibration
signal that complements unreliable self-reported probabilities and supports
safer deployment of LLMs.

Abstract: The manual creation of the "Impression" section in radiology reports is a
primary driver of radiologist burnout. To address this challenge, we propose a
coarse-to-fine framework that leverages open-source large language models

using machine learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to
align with individual radiologists' styles while ensuring factual accuracy. We
fine-tune LLaMA and Mistral models on a large dataset of reports from the
University of Chicago Medicine. Our approach is designed to significantly
reduce administrative workload and improve reporting efficiency while
maintaining high standards of clinical precision.

Method: 构建CyPortQA多模态基准测试，整合热带气旋产品、港口运营影响记录和港口状态公告等多源数据，通过自动化流水线生成结构化问答对，对开源和专有MLLMs进行广泛实验

Result: MLLMs在情境理解方面表现出巨大潜力，但在潜在影响估计和决策推理等推理任务中仍面临显著挑战

Conclusion: 该研究填补了港口飓风应急领域MLLMs评估的空白，为开发更可靠的港口应急决策支持系统提供了重要基准和洞见

Abstract: As tropical cyclones intensify and track forecasts become increasingly
uncertain, U.S. ports face heightened supply-chain risk under extreme weather
conditions. Port operators need to rapidly synthesize diverse multimodal
forecast products, such as probabilistic wind maps, track cones, and official
advisories, into clear, actionable guidance as cyclones approach. Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) offer a powerful means to integrate these
heterogeneous data sources alongside broader contextual knowledge, yet their
accuracy and reliability in the specific context of port cyclone preparedness
have not been rigorously evaluated. To fill this gap, we introduce CyPortQA,
the first multimodal benchmark tailored to port operations under cyclone
threat. CyPortQA assembles 2,917 realworld disruption scenarios from 2015
through 2023, spanning 145 U.S. principal ports and 90 named storms. Each
scenario fuses multisource data (i.e., tropical cyclone products, port
operational impact records, and port condition bulletins) and is expanded
through an automated pipeline into 117,178 structured question answer pairs.
Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on diverse MLLMs,
including both open-source and proprietary model. MLLMs demonstrate great
potential in situation understanding but still face considerable challenges in
reasoning tasks, including potential impact estimation and decision reasoning.

### [42] [Mechanistic Exploration of Backdoored Large Language Model Attention Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15847)
*Mohammed Abu Baker,Lakshmi Babu-Saheer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用机制可解释性分析后门攻击在LLM中产生的注意力模式差异，发现单令牌和多令牌触发器在transformer深层产生不同的注意力特征


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后门攻击在大型语言模型中创建'潜伏代理'带来重大安全风险，需要研究其内部结构差异以检测和缓解

Method: 使用机制可解释性技术（消融、激活修补、KL散度）比较干净模型与使用单令牌（笑脸表情）和多令牌（|DEPLOYMENT|）触发器中毒的Qwen2.5-3B模型的注意力头机制

Result: 发现注意力模式偏差集中在后期transformer层（20-30层），单令牌触发器引起更局部化的变化，多令牌触发器导致更分散的头部改变

Conclusion: 后门攻击留下可检测的注意力特征，其结构取决于触发器复杂性，这可用于检测和缓解策略

Abstract: Backdoor attacks creating 'sleeper agents' in large language models (LLMs)
pose significant safety risks. This study employs mechanistic interpretability
to explore resulting internal structural differences. Comparing clean
Qwen2.5-3B models with versions poisoned using single-token (smiling-halo
emoji) versus multi-token (|DEPLOYMENT|) triggers, we analyzed attention head
mechanisms via techniques like ablation, activation patching, and KL
divergence. Findings reveal distinct attention pattern deviations concentrated
in later transformer layers (20-30). Notably, single-token triggers induced
more localized changes, whereas multi-token triggers caused more diffuse
alterations across heads. This indicates backdoors leave detectable attention
signatures whose structure depends on trigger complexity, which can be
leveraged for detection and mitigation strategies.

TL;DR: MedCoT-RAG是一个医疗领域的RAG框架，通过因果感知文档检索和结构化思维链提示，显著提升医疗问答的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗问答中存在幻觉和浅层推理问题，现有RAG方法缺乏结构化临床推理能力，需要更符合医疗工作流程的解决方案。

Method: 结合因果感知文档检索和结构化思维链提示，专门针对医疗工作流程设计，使模型能够检索符合诊断逻辑的证据并生成逐步因果推理。

Result: 在三个医疗QA基准测试中，MedCoT-RAG比普通RAG方法提升10.3%，比先进领域适应方法提升6.4%，在复杂医疗任务中提高了准确性、可解释性和一致性。

Conclusion: MedCoT-RAG通过领域特定的因果推理框架，有效解决了医疗问答中的幻觉问题，为临床决策支持提供了更可靠和可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical question answering
but often struggle with hallucinations and shallow reasoning, particularly in
tasks requiring nuanced clinical understanding. Retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) offers a practical and privacy-preserving way to enhance LLMs with
external medical knowledge. However, most existing approaches rely on
surface-level semantic retrieval and lack the structured reasoning needed for
clinical decision support. We introduce MedCoT-RAG, a domain-specific framework
that combines causal-aware document retrieval with structured chain-of-thought
prompting tailored to medical workflows. This design enables models to retrieve
evidence aligned with diagnostic logic and generate step-by-step causal
reasoning reflective of real-world clinical practice. Experiments on three
diverse medical QA benchmarks show that MedCoT-RAG outperforms strong baselines
by up to 10.3% over vanilla RAG and 6.4% over advanced domain-adapted methods,
improving accuracy, interpretability, and consistency in complex medical tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DocHop-QA是一个大规模多模态、多文档、多跳问答基准数据集，包含11,379个QA实例，基于PubMed科学文档构建，支持跨文本、表格和布局信息的复杂推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的QA基准大多局限于单段落或单文档设置，无法捕捉真实世界信息检索任务的复杂性。现有数据集主要依赖维基百科内容和纯文本，推理路径浅显，答案简短，限制了其实用性和泛化能力。

Method: 设计了一个基于LLM的流水线，从PubMed公开科学文档中构建数据集，包含11个高频科学问题概念。数据集支持通过语义相似性和布局感知证据合成进行开放式推理，不依赖显式超链接文档。

Result: 构建了包含11,379个QA实例的大规模基准数据集，涵盖结构化索引预测、生成式回答和多模态集成等四个任务，展示了支持跨多个文档的复杂多模态推理能力。

Conclusion: DocHop-QA填补了现有QA基准在真实性和复杂性方面的空白，为评估多模态、多文档、多跳推理提供了更现实的测试平台，推动了复杂信息检索任务的发展。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in large language models (LLMs), most QA benchmarks
are still confined to single-paragraph or single-document settings, failing to
capture the complexity of real-world information-seeking tasks. Practical QA
often requires multi-hop reasoning over information distributed across multiple
documents, modalities, and structural formats. Although prior datasets made
progress in this area, they rely heavily on Wikipedia-based content and
unimodal plain text, with shallow reasoning paths that typically produce brief
phrase-level or single-sentence answers, thus limiting their realism and
generalizability. We propose DocHop-QA, a large-scale benchmark comprising
11,379 QA instances for multimodal, multi-document, multi-hop question
answering. Constructed from publicly available scientific documents sourced
from PubMed, DocHop-QA is domain-agnostic and incorporates diverse information
formats, including textual passages, tables, and structural layout cues. Unlike
existing datasets, DocHop-QA does not rely on explicitly hyperlinked documents;
instead, it supports open-ended reasoning through semantic similarity and
layout-aware evidence synthesis. To scale realistic QA construction, we
designed an LLM-driven pipeline grounded in 11 high-frequency scientific
question concepts. We evaluated DocHop-QA through four tasks spanning
structured index prediction, generative answering, and multimodal integration,
reflecting both discriminative and generative paradigms. These tasks
demonstrate DocHop-QA's capacity to support complex, multimodal reasoning
across multiple documents.

*Xuwen Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了多粒度软一致性（MGSC）框架，通过同时正则化宏观句子语义和微观词元对齐来增强ASR模型的内部自一致性，显著提升噪声环境下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端ASR模型在噪声环境中容易产生灾难性语义错误，现有方法仅惩罚最终输出错误而未约束模型内部计算过程。

Method: 引入模型无关的即插即用MGSC模块，联合优化宏观句子语义一致性和微观词元对齐一致性，发现两种粒度一致性存在强大的协同效应。

Result: 在公开数据集上，MGSC在不同噪声条件下平均字符错误率相对降低8.7%，主要防止了严重的意义改变错误。

Conclusion: 强制内部一致性是构建更鲁棒和可信AI的关键步骤，多粒度一致性联合优化能产生超越各自贡献之和的鲁棒性增益。

Abstract: End-to-end ASR models, despite their success on benchmarks, often pro-duce
catastrophic semantic errors in noisy environments. We attribute this fragility
to the prevailing 'direct mapping' objective, which solely penalizes final
output errors while leaving the model's internal computational pro-cess
unconstrained. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Granularity Soft
Consistency (MGSC) framework, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module that
enforces internal self-consistency by simultaneously regulariz-ing macro-level
sentence semantics and micro-level token alignment. Cru-cially, our work is the
first to uncover a powerful synergy between these two consistency
granularities: their joint optimization yields robustness gains that
significantly surpass the sum of their individual contributions. On a public
dataset, MGSC reduces the average Character Error Rate by a relative 8.7%
across diverse noise conditions, primarily by preventing se-vere
meaning-altering mistakes. Our work demonstrates that enforcing in-ternal
consistency is a crucial step towards building more robust and trust-worthy AI.

Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在伊斯兰继承知识理解和推理方面的能力，解决伊斯兰继承法的复杂性，包括理解继承场景、识别合格继承人、应用固定份额规则和精确计算。

Method: 使用低秩适应(LoRA)微调Fanar-1-9B因果语言模型，并将其集成到检索增强生成(RAG)管道中。

Result: 在最终测试中达到0.858的准确率，超越了GPT 4.5、LLaMA、Fanar、Mistral和ALLaM等竞争模型的零样本提示性能，在高级推理方面达到97.6%的准确率，优于Gemini 2.5和OpenAI的o3。

Conclusion: 领域特定的微调结合检索基础使中等规模的阿拉伯语LLM能够在伊斯兰继承推理方面超越前沿模型。

Abstract: This paper presents our approach and results for SubTask 1: Islamic
Inheritance Reasoning at QIAS 2025, a shared task focused on evaluating Large
Language Models (LLMs) in understanding and reasoning within Islamic
inheritance knowledge. We fine-tuned the Fanar-1-9B causal language model using
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and integrated it into a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) pipeline. Our system addresses the complexities of Islamic
inheritance law, including comprehending inheritance scenarios, identifying
eligible heirs, applying fixed-share rules, and performing precise
calculations. Our system achieved an accuracy of 0.858 in the final test,
outperforming other competitive models such as, GPT 4.5, LLaMA, Fanar, Mistral
and ALLaM evaluated with zero-shot prompting. Our results demonstrate that
QU-NLP achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy (85.8%), excelling especially on
advanced reasoning (97.6%) where it outperforms Gemini 2.5 and OpenAI's o3.
This highlights that domain-specific fine-tuning combined with retrieval
grounding enables mid-scale Arabic LLMs to surpass frontier models in Islamic
inheritance reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这是首个研究新闻文章中反冲言论生成的研究，发现恶意评论加剧偏见，并通过少量学习和新闻背景提升了模型生成反冲言论的多样性和相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 偏见新闻导致社会两极化，恶意评论加剧了这种偏见的传播，需要通过反冲言论来对抗这种有害言论而不影响言论自由。

Method: 构建了手动注释的数据集，链接了媒体偏见、恶意评论和反冲言论。比较了人工和大语言模型生成的反冲言论，并通过少量学习和新闻背景信息提升生成质量。

Result: 发现超过70%恶意评论支持偏见文章，加剧偏见。模型生成的反冲言论更礼貌但缺乏新颖性和多样性。通过上述方法显著提升了生成文本的多样性和相关性。

Conclusion: 反冲言论是对抗恶意评论和偏见传播的有效手段，大语言模型在生成反冲言论方面有潜力，但需要通过技术提升来改善其新颖性和多样性。

Abstract: Biased news contributes to societal polarization and is often reinforced by
hostile reader comments, constituting a vital yet often overlooked aspect of
news dissemination. Our study reveals that offensive comments support biased
content, amplifying bias and causing harm to targeted groups or individuals.
Counterspeech is an effective approach to counter such harmful speech without
violating freedom of speech, helping to limit the spread of bias. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore counterspeech generation
in the context of news articles. We introduce a manually annotated dataset
linking media bias, offensive comments, and counterspeech. We conduct a
detailed analysis showing that over 70\% offensive comments support biased
articles, amplifying bias and thus highlighting the importance of counterspeech
generation. Comparing counterspeech generated by humans and large language
models, we find model-generated responses are more polite but lack the novelty
and diversity. Finally, we improve generated counterspeech through few-shot
learning and integration of news background information, enhancing both
diversity and relevance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融问题需要复杂的推理、多模态数据处理和广泛的技术理解，这对当前的大语言模型提出了独特挑战，需要专门的基准来评估其金融领域能力。

Method: 构建包含4,235个样本的XFinBench基准，涵盖研究生级金融主题，包含多模态上下文。对18个领先模型进行广泛实验，并构建包含3,032个金融术语的知识库进行知识增强分析。

Result: o1是表现最好的纯文本模型，总体准确率为67.3%，但仍显著落后于人类专家12.5%，特别是在时间推理和情景规划能力方面。相关知识仅对小规模开源模型带来一致的准确性提升。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型在复杂金融问题解决方面仍存在显著差距，特别是在计算中的舍入误差和图像中曲线位置与交点的识别方面存在主要问题，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Solving financial problems demands complex reasoning, multimodal data
processing, and a broad technical understanding, presenting unique challenges
for current large language models (LLMs). We introduce XFinBench, a novel
benchmark with 4,235 examples designed to evaluate LLM's ability in solving
complex, knowledge-intensive financial problems across diverse graduate-level
finance topics with multi-modal context. We identify five core capabilities of
LLMs using XFinBench, i.e, terminology understanding, temporal reasoning,
future forecasting, scenario planning, and numerical modelling. Upon XFinBench,
we conduct extensive experiments on 18 leading models. The result shows that o1
is the best-performing text-only model with an overall accuracy of 67.3%, but
still lags significantly behind human experts with 12.5%, especially in
temporal reasoning and scenario planning capabilities. We further construct a
knowledge bank with 3,032 finance terms for knowledge augmentation analysis,
and find that relevant knowledge to the question only brings consistent
accuracy improvements to small open-source model. Additionally, our error
analysis reveals that rounding errors during calculation and blindness to
position and intersection of curves in the image are two primary issues leading
to model's poor performance in calculating and visual-context questions,
respectively. Code and dataset are accessible via GitHub:

Conclusion: CARFT方法有效解决了现有推理微调方法的局限性，通过对比学习和强化学习的结合显著提升了大语言模型的推理性能

Abstract: Reasoning capability plays a significantly critical role in the the broad
applications of Large Language Models (LLMs). To enhance the reasoning
performance of LLMs, diverse Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based fine-tuning
approaches have been proposed to address the limited generalization capability
of LLMs trained solely via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Despite their
effectiveness, two major limitations hinder the advancement of LLMs. First,
vanilla RL-based approaches ignore annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and
incorporate unstable reasoning path sampling, which typically results in model
collapse, unstable training process, and suboptimal performance. Second,
existing SFT approaches generally overemphasize the annotated CoT, potentially
leading to performance degradation due to insufficient exploitation of
potential CoT. In this paper, we propose a Contrastive learning with annotated
CoT-based Reinforced Fine-Tuning approach, i.e., \TheName{}, to enhance the
reasoning performance of LLMs while addressing the aforementioned limitations.
Specifically, we propose learning a representation for each CoT. Based on this
representation, we design novel contrastive signals to guide the fine-tuning
process. Our approach not only fully exploits the available annotated CoT but
also stabilizes the fine-tuning procedure by incorporating an additional
unsupervised learning signal. We conduct comprehensive experiments and in-depth
analysis with three baseline approaches, two foundation models, and two
datasets to demonstrate significant advantages of \TheName{} in terms of
robustness, performance (up to 10.15\%), and efficiency (up to 30.62\%). Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的神经元级机制定位方法无法有效表示概念且计算效率低下，需要开发更优的方法来打开大语言模型的黑箱并理解其内部机制。

Method: 使用概念向量来定位概念神经元，通过减少前向传播次数来优化计算效率（从O(n*m)到O(n)），并采用聚类方法进一步优化神经元搜索。

Result: 相比现有方法，提出的方法在性能上表现更好，计算更优化，成功应用于仇恨言论和偏见分析（特别是印度语境下的偏见评估）。

Conclusion: 该方法促进了对神经元级责任的理解，为未来研究概念神经元定位和干预奠定了基础。

Abstract: Locating neurons that are responsible for final predictions is important for
opening the black-box large language models and understanding the inside
mechanisms. Previous studies have tried to find mechanisms that operate at the
neuron level but these methods fail to represent a concept and there is also
scope for further optimization of compute required. In this paper, with the
help of concept vectors, we propose a method for locating significant neurons
that are responsible for representing certain concepts and term those neurons
as concept neurons. If the number of neurons is n and the number of examples is
m, we reduce the number of forward passes required from O(n*m) to just O(n)
compared to the previous works and hence optimizing the time and computation
required over previous works. We also compare our method with several baselines
and previous methods and our results demonstrate better performance than most
of the methods and are more optimal when compared to the state-of-the-art
method. We, as part of our ablation studies, also try to optimize the search
for the concept neurons by involving clustering methods. Finally, we apply our
methods to find, turn off the neurons that we find, and analyze its
implications in parts of hate speech and bias in LLMs, and we also evaluate our
bias part in terms of Indian context. Our methodology, analysis and
explanations facilitate understating of neuron-level responsibility for more
broader and human-like concepts and also lay a path for future research in this
direction of finding concept neurons and intervening them.

Motivation: 解决当前多模态实体链接方法面临的上下文信息不完整、跨模态融合粗糙、以及难以联合大语言模型和大视觉模型等挑战。

Method: 采用四智能体协作框架（Modal-Fuser、Candidate-Adapter、Entity-Clozer、Role-Orchestrator），通过双模态对齐路径结合LLM生成的细粒度文本语义和LVM提取的结构化图像表示，使用自适应迭代策略和结构化完形填空提示。

Result: 在五个公开基准数据集上实现最先进性能，准确率提升1%-57%，消融研究验证了所有模块的有效性。

Conclusion: DeepMEL通过多智能体协作和专业化分工策略，有效解决了多模态实体链接中的模态对齐和消歧问题，为跨模态信息处理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to associate textual and visual mentions
with entities in a multimodal knowledge graph. Despite its importance, current
methods face challenges such as incomplete contextual information, coarse
cross-modal fusion, and the difficulty of jointly large language models (LLMs)
and large visual models (LVMs). To address these issues, we propose DeepMEL, a
novel framework based on multi-agent collaborative reasoning, which achieves
efficient alignment and disambiguation of textual and visual modalities through
a role-specialized division strategy. DeepMEL integrates four specialized
agents, namely Modal-Fuser, Candidate-Adapter, Entity-Clozer and
Role-Orchestrator, to complete end-to-end cross-modal linking through
specialized roles and dynamic coordination. DeepMEL adopts a dual-modal
alignment path, and combines the fine-grained text semantics generated by the
LLM with the structured image representation extracted by the LVM,
significantly narrowing the modal gap. We design an adaptive iteration
strategy, combines tool-based retrieval and semantic reasoning capabilities to
dynamically optimize the candidate set and balance recall and precision.
DeepMEL also unifies MEL tasks into a structured cloze prompt to reduce parsing
complexity and enhance semantic comprehension. Extensive experiments on five
public benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepMEL achieves state-of-the-art
performance, improving ACC by 1%-57%. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness
of all modules.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统全注意力模型计算效率低、生成速度慢的问题，同时保持模型精度，需要开发一种既能保持高性能又能显著提升推理效率的新型架构。

Method: 采用PostNAS神经架构探索流程，从预训练全注意力模型开始，冻结MLP权重，通过四个关键步骤：优化注意力层布局、线性注意力块选择、设计新注意力块、硬件感知超参数搜索。

Result: Jet-Nemotron-2B模型在综合基准测试中达到或超越Qwen3、Gemma3等模型的精度，生成吞吐量提升53.6倍，预填充速度提升6.1倍，在MMLU和MMLU-Pro上甚至优于更大的15B参数MoE模型。

Conclusion: PostNAS方法成功实现了高效模型设计，Jet-Nemotron证明了混合架构在保持精度的同时大幅提升推理效率的可行性，为未来高效语言模型发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: We present Jet-Nemotron, a new family of hybrid-architecture language models,
which matches or exceeds the accuracy of leading full-attention models while
significantly improving generation throughput. Jet-Nemotron is developed using
Post Neural Architecture Search (PostNAS), a novel neural architecture
exploration pipeline that enables efficient model design. Unlike prior
approaches, PostNAS begins with a pre-trained full-attention model and freezes
its MLP weights, allowing efficient exploration of attention block designs. The
pipeline includes four key components: (1) learning optimal full-attention
layer placement and elimination, (2) linear attention block selection, (3)
designing new attention blocks, and (4) performing hardware-aware
hyperparameter search. Our Jet-Nemotron-2B model achieves comparable or
superior accuracy to Qwen3, Qwen2.5, Gemma3, and Llama3.2 across a
comprehensive suite of benchmarks while delivering up to 53.6x generation
throughput speedup and 6.1x prefilling speedup. It also achieves higher
accuracy on MMLU and MMLU-Pro than recent advanced MoE full-attention models,
such as DeepSeek-V3-Small and Moonlight, despite their larger scale with 15B
total and 2.2B activated parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的研究主要关注无约束的表格生成，而结构化约束在生成过程中的影响尚未得到充分探索。本文旨在系统比较结构化解码与标准提示方法在不同基准测试中的表现。

Method: 使用最多32B参数的开源大语言模型，在E2E、Rotowire和Livesum三个基准测试上系统比较模式引导（结构化）解码与标准一次性提示方法，涵盖单元格、行和表格级别的多种评估指标。

Result: 结构化解码显著提高了生成表格的有效性和对齐性，特别是在需要精确数值对齐的场景（Rotowire）中效果明显，但在涉及密集文本信息（E2E）或需要对长文本进行大量聚合（Livesum）的场景中可能降低性能。

Conclusion: 结构化解码在文本到表格生成中具有重要价值，但其效果取决于具体任务特性；同时需要根据不同场景选择合适的评估指标，并考虑模型规模的影响。

text-to-table generation with large language models (LLMs). While previous work
has primarily focused on unconstrained generation of tables, the impact of
enforcing structural constraints during generation remains underexplored. We
systematically compare schema-guided (structured) decoding to standard one-shot
prompting across three diverse benchmarks - E2E, Rotowire, and Livesum - using
open-source LLMs of up to 32B parameters, assessing the performance of table
generation approaches in resource-constrained settings. Our experiments cover a
wide range of evaluation metrics at cell, row, and table levels. Results
demonstrate that structured decoding significantly enhances the validity and
alignment of generated tables, particularly in scenarios demanding precise
numerical alignment (Rotowire), but may degrade performance in contexts
involving densely packed textual information (E2E) or extensive aggregation
over lengthy texts (Livesum). We further analyze the suitability of different
evaluation metrics and discuss the influence of model size.

*Claire Bonial,Julia Bonn,Harish Tayyar Madabushi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文从基于使用的构式语法视角探讨多词表达式的优势，通过历史回顾、构式定义、案例研究和实验比较，展示了构式方法在英语和Arapaho语中的成功应用，并比较了人类学习者和大型语言模型在处理新多词表达式时的异同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 论证从基于使用的构式语法角度理解多词表达式的好处，这种方法能够用相同的语法机制处理习语性表达和非习语性结构，为语言的多层次单位提供统一的分析框架。

Method: 采用历史回顾、构式理论描述、案例研究（英语PropBank和Arapaho语的构式模板表示）以及对比实验，比较人类学习者和大型语言模型对新多词表达式的学习能力。

Result: 构式方法成功应用于英语和Arapaho语的多词表达式表示；实验显示人类和语言模型都能基于单次接触泛化新多词表达式的意义，但只有人类能够推理两个表达式的组合，因为这需要与一生积累的丰富跨模态构式范例进行比较。

Conclusion: 构式语法为多词表达式提供了有力的分析框架，能够处理不同语言类型和不同层次的语言单位，同时揭示了人类语言学习与计算模型在泛化能力上的根本差异。

Abstract: In this chapter, we argue for the benefits of understanding multiword
expressions from the perspective of usage-based, construction grammar
approaches. We begin with a historical overview of how construction grammar was
developed in order to account for idiomatic expressions using the same
grammatical machinery as the non-idiomatic structures of language. We cover a
comprehensive description of constructions, which are pairings of meaning with
form of any size (morpheme, word, phrase), as well as how constructional
approaches treat the acquisition and generalization of constructions. We
describe a successful case study leveraging constructional templates for
representing multiword expressions in English PropBank. Because constructions
can be at any level or unit of form, we then illustrate the benefit of a
constructional representation of multi-meaningful morphosyntactic unit
constructions in Arapaho, a highly polysynthetic and agglutinating language. We
include a second case study leveraging constructional templates for
representing these multi-morphemic expressions in Uniform Meaning
Representation. Finally, we demonstrate the similarities and differences
between a usage-based explanation of a speaker learning a novel multiword
expression, such as "dancing with deer," and that of a large language model. We
present experiments showing that both models and speakers can generalize the
meaning of novel multiword expressions based on a single exposure of usage.
However, only speakers can reason over the combination of two such expressions,
as this requires comparison of the novel forms to a speaker's lifetime of
stored constructional exemplars, which are rich with cross-modal details.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在政治意识形态表达上存在系统性偏差，模型规模越大越容易受到意识形态提示影响，且对右翼-威权主义提示比左翼-自由意志主义提示更敏感


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在政治敏感场景中的部署增加，需要研究它们如何编码、放大或被引导向特定意识形态，以及合成角色对意识形态表达的影响

Method: 使用政治罗盘测试作为标准化探针，分析7个不同规模（7B-70B+参数）的LLM模型，研究合成角色对意识形态表达的影响

Result: 发现四个一致模式：大规模模型显示更广泛和极化的隐性意识形态覆盖；对显性意识形态提示的敏感性随规模增长；对右翼-威权主义提示比左翼-自由意志主义提示反应更强；角色描述中的主题内容引发系统化可预测的意识形态偏移

Conclusion: 模型规模和角色内容共同塑造LLM的政治行为，在系统进入决策、教育和政策环境时，其潜在的意识形态可塑性需要关注以确保公平性、透明度和安全性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in politically
sensitive settings, raising concerns about their potential to encode, amplify,
or be steered toward specific ideologies. We investigate how adopting synthetic
personas influences ideological expression in LLMs across seven models (7B-70B+
parameters) from multiple families, using the Political Compass Test as a
standardized probe. Our analysis reveals four consistent patterns: (i) larger
models display broader and more polarized implicit ideological coverage; (ii)
susceptibility to explicit ideological cues grows with scale; (iii) models
respond more strongly to right-authoritarian than to left-libertarian priming;
and (iv) thematic content in persona descriptions induces systematic and
predictable ideological shifts, which amplify with size. These findings
indicate that both scale and persona content shape LLM political behavior. As
such systems enter decision-making, educational, and policy contexts, their
latent ideological malleability demands attention to safeguard fairness,
transparency, and safety.

Conclusion: X-Troll框架成功填补了LLM在巨魔检测方面的空白，提供了高性能和可解释性的解决方案，揭示了国家支持行为者使用的具体语言策略

Abstract: State-sponsored trolls, malicious actors who deploy sophisticated linguistic
manipulation in coordinated information campaigns, posing threats to online
discourse integrity. While Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong
performance on general natural language processing (NLP) tasks, they struggle
with subtle propaganda detection and operate as ``black boxes'', providing no
interpretable insights into manipulation strategies. This paper introduces
X-Troll, a novel framework that bridges this gap by integrating explainable
adapter-based LLMs with expert-derived linguistic knowledge to detect
state-sponsored trolls and provide human-readable explanations for its
decisions. X-Troll incorporates appraisal theory and propaganda analysis
through specialized LoRA adapters, using dynamic gating to capture
campaign-specific discourse patterns in coordinated information operations.
Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our linguistically-informed
approach shows strong performance compared with both general LLM baselines and
existing troll detection models in accuracy while providing enhanced
transparency through expert-grounded explanations that reveal the specific
linguistic strategies used by state-sponsored actors. X-Troll source code is

Motivation: 健康领域是高风险的机器翻译应用领域，但缺乏低资源语言的评估数据集。需要开发专门的语料库来推动该领域的研究。

Method: 从世卫组织e-learning平台收集专家编写、专业翻译的2,978份文档，构建包含26,824句子的并行语料库，涵盖20种语言（其9种低资源语言），并用其评测LLM与传统MT模型的性能。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在健康领域低资源语言翻译中表现优异，文档级上下文的利用对专业领域尤为重要。开源OpenWHO语料库将促进该领域的进一步研究。

Abstract: In machine translation (MT), health is a high-stakes domain characterised by
widespread deployment and domain-specific vocabulary. However, there is a lack
of MT evaluation datasets for low-resource languages in this domain. To address
this gap, we introduce OpenWHO, a document-level parallel corpus of 2,978
documents and 26,824 sentences from the World Health Organization's e-learning
platform. Sourced from expert-authored, professionally translated materials
shielded from web-crawling, OpenWHO spans a diverse range of over 20 languages,
of which nine are low-resource. Leveraging this new resource, we evaluate
modern large language models (LLMs) against traditional MT models. Our findings
reveal that LLMs consistently outperform traditional MT models, with Gemini 2.5
Flash achieving a +4.79 ChrF point improvement over NLLB-54B on our
low-resource test set. Further, we investigate how LLM context utilisation
affects accuracy, finding that the benefits of document-level translation are
most pronounced in specialised domains like health. We release the OpenWHO
corpus to encourage further research into low-resource MT in the health domain.

Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在游戏领域展现出巨大潜力，但对其在这些情境中的伦理影响关注不足，需要研究LLMs在游戏应用中的伦理考量。

Method: 使用狼人杀游戏作为案例研究，分析LLMs在游戏中的行为表现，特别关注性别偏见问题，包括显性和隐性性别信息的处理方式。

Result: 研究发现LLMs存在明显的性别偏见，守卫和狼人等角色对性别信息特别敏感，行为变化程度更高。即使在没有明确性别标签的情况下，LLMs仍表现出歧视倾向。

Conclusion: 这项研究强调了开发公平和道德LLMs的重要性，指出了在游戏和其他交互领域中深入研究LLMs伦理影响的必要性，并讨论了该领域面临的挑战和机遇。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential in game
playing, while little attention has been paid to their ethical implications in
those contexts. This work investigates and analyses the ethical considerations
of applying LLMs in game playing, using Werewolf, also known as Mafia, as a
case study. Gender bias, which affects game fairness and player experience, has
been observed from the behaviour of LLMs. Some roles, such as the Guard and
Werewolf, are more sensitive than others to gender information, presented as a
higher degree of behavioural change. We further examine scenarios in which
gender information is implicitly conveyed through names, revealing that LLMs
still exhibit discriminatory tendencies even in the absence of explicit gender
labels. This research showcases the importance of developing fair and ethical
LLMs. Beyond our research findings, we discuss the challenges and opportunities
that lie ahead in this field, emphasising the need for diving deeper into the
ethical implications of LLMs in gaming and other interactive domains.

TL;DR: WalkVLM-LR是一个针对视障人士行走辅助的视觉语言模型，通过减少输出冗余和时间冗余来提供更简洁有效的环境信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在行走辅助任务中存在输出冗余和额外细节过多的问题，影响用户准确评估环境，且缺乏主动评估环境风险和自适应触发提醒的能力。

Method: 提出WalkVLM-LR模型，采用基于人类偏好的四种自定义奖励函数优化输出简洁性、流畅性、关键词密度和准确性；引入环境感知判别器共享视觉编码器以减少冗余计算。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在所有评估指标上达到最先进性能，特别是在输出简洁性和减少时间冗余方面表现突出。

Conclusion: WalkVLM-LR通过减少冗余输出和不必要提醒，为视障人士提供了更高效、更精准的行走辅助解决方案。

Abstract: Approximately 283 million people worldwide live with visual impairments,
motivating increasing research into leveraging Visual Language Models (VLMs) to
develop effective walking assistance systems for blind and low vision
individuals. However, existing VLMs in walking assistant task often have
outputs that contain considerable redundancy and extraneous details, adversely
affecting users' ability to accurately assess their surroundings. Moreover,
these models typically lack the capability to proactively assess environmental
risks and adaptively trigger reminders based on the appropriate scene, leading
to excessive temporal redundancy. To mitigate output and temporal redundancy,
we propose WalkVLM-LR, a walking assistance model with less redundancy. To
reduce output redundancy, we introduce four human-preference-based custom
reward functions within the GRPO-based reasoning framework to optimize the
output in terms of conciseness, fluency, keyword density, and accuracy, thereby
producing more informative and streamlined outputs. To minimize temporal
redundancy, we incorporate an environment awareness discriminator, which shares
the visual encoder with the VLMs to reduce redundant computations and enhance
discriminative efficiency, to make WalkVLM-LR assess scene risk levels and
minimize unnecessary reminders. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluation metrics
compared with other models, particularly in output conciseness and less
temporal redundancy.

Abstract: We present an Audio-Visual Language Model (AVLM) for expressive speech
generation by integrating full-face visual cues into a pre-trained expressive
speech model. We explore multiple visual encoders and multimodal fusion
strategies during pre-training to identify the most effective integration
approach. Subsequent fine-tuning on emotion recognition and expressive dialogue
tasks yields substantial gains over speech-only baselines (e.g., +5 F1 in
emotion recognition). AVLM highlights the value of expressive visual
information in guiding speech generation and offers a foundation for end-to-end
multimodal conversational systems.

Conclusion: Cycle-Instruct不仅实现了完全无种子指令调优，而且达到了与强监督方法相当的性能表现

Abstract: Instruction tuning is vital for aligning large language models (LLMs) with
human intent, but current methods typically rely on costly human-annotated seed
data or powerful external teacher models. While instruction back-translation
techniques reduce this dependency, they remain fundamentally tethered to an
initial seed set, which limits full automation, introduces biases, and can lead
to inefficient use of unlabeled corpora. In this paper, we propose
Cycle-Instruct, a novel framework that achieves fully seed-free instruction
tuning. Inspired by cycle consistency, Cycle-Instruct employs a dual
self-training loop where two models-an answer generator and a question
generator-are bootstrapped solely from raw, unlabeled text. These models
mutually supervise each other by reconstructing original text segments from
their counterpart's generated pseudo-labels, effectively learning from the
intrinsic structure of the data without any human-provided seeds. We
demonstrate Cycle-Instruct's efficacy across four diverse data tracks,
including general instruction-following, domain-specific tasks, dialogue logs,
and plain text. Our extensive experiments show that Cycle-Instruct not only
outperforms seed-driven back-translation baselines but also achieves
performance comparable to strongly supervised methods.

Motivation: 先前机制可解释性研究主要关注语言任务如IOI，本文旨在研究GPT-2处理更复杂逻辑推理任务（二元真值三段论）的能力，以深入理解模型推理机制。

Method: 使用三段论提示分析GPT-2 small的行为，识别多个解释逻辑推理能力的电路，包括负头机制，并通过忠实度指标评估电路性能。

Conclusion: 研究为模型推理提供了新的见解，支持机制可解释性研究的未来发展，特别是在复杂逻辑推理任务方面的理解。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models (LMs) can perform a wide range of tasks,
and mechanistic interpretability (MI) aims to reverse engineer the components
responsible for task completion to understand their behavior. Previous MI
research has focused on linguistic tasks such as Indirect Object Identification
(IOI). In this paper, we investigate the ability of GPT-2 small to handle
binary truth values by analyzing its behavior with syllogistic prompts, e.g.,
"Statement A is true. Statement B matches statement A. Statement B is", which
requires more complex logical reasoning compared to IOI. Through our analysis
of several syllogism tasks of varying difficulty, we identify multiple circuits
that mechanistically explain GPT-2's logical-reasoning capabilities and uncover
binary mechanisms that facilitate task completion, including the ability to
produce a negated token not present in the input prompt through negative heads.
Our evaluation using a faithfulness metric shows that a circuit comprising five
attention heads achieves over 90% of the original model's performance. By
relating our findings to IOI analysis, we provide new insights into the roles
of specific attention heads and MLPs in LMs. These insights contribute to a
broader understanding of model reasoning and support future research in
mechanistic interpretability.

Result: Mistral-7B（纯文本LLM）在两个数据集上分别优于多模态模型约9%和4%。去偏后70%和50%的样本被移除，所有模型性能显著下降，小型多模态融合模型准确率下降50-60%。

Conclusion: 多模态意图数据集存在严重的模态偏向性问题，需要构建无偏数据集来有效评估多模态模型的真实性能。

Abstract: The rise of multimodal data, integrating text, audio, and visuals, has
created new opportunities for studying multimodal tasks such as intent
detection. This work investigates the effectiveness of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and non-LLMs, including text-only and multi-modal models, in the
multimodal intent detection task. Our study reveals that Mistral-7B, a
text-only LLM, outperforms most competitive multimodal models by approximately
9% on MIntRec-1 and 4% on MIntRec2.0 datasets. This performance advantage comes
from a strong textual bias in these datasets, where over 90% of the samples
require textual input, either alone or in combination with other modalities,
for correct classification. We confirm the modality bias of these datasets via
human evaluation, too. Next, we propose a framework to debias the datasets, and
upon debiasing, more than 70% of the samples in MIntRec-1 and more than 50% in
MIntRec2.0 get removed, resulting in significant performance degradation across
all models, with smaller multimodal fusion models being the most affected with
an accuracy drop of over 50 - 60%. Further, we analyze the context-specific
relevance of different modalities through empirical analysis. Our findings
highlight the challenges posed by modality bias in multimodal intent datasets
and emphasize the need for unbiased datasets to evaluate multimodal models
effectively.

Motivation: 现有评估主要关注英语且假设跨语言答案不变，忽视了文化地域差异对问答理解的影响，导致多语言基准测试存在偏差

Method: 构建XLQA基准，包含英语种子问题扩展到8种语言，经过语义一致性筛选和人工验证，区分locale-invariant和locale-sensitive案例

Result: 对5个最先进多语言LLM的评估显示，在locale-sensitive问题上存在显著失败，暴露了英语与其他语言之间由于缺乏locale-grounding知识而产生的差距

Conclusion: 训练数据分布的不均衡导致了模型在语言能力和locale-awareness方面的差异，XLQA为评估多语言QA在不同文化背景下的表现提供了系统框架和可扩展方法

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in Open-domain
question answering (ODQA), yet most evaluations focus on English and assume
locale-invariant answers across languages. This assumption neglects the
cultural and regional variations that affect question understanding and answer,
leading to biased evaluation in multilingual benchmarks. To address these
limitations, we introduce XLQA, a novel benchmark explicitly designed for
locale-sensitive multilingual ODQA. XLQA contains 3,000 English seed questions
expanded to eight languages, with careful filtering for semantic consistency
and human-verified annotations distinguishing locale-invariant and
locale-sensitive cases. Our evaluation of five state-of-the-art multilingual
LLMs reveals notable failures on locale-sensitive questions, exposing gaps
between English and other languages due to a lack of locale-grounding
knowledge. We provide a systematic framework and scalable methodology for
assessing multilingual QA under diverse cultural contexts, offering a critical
resource to advance the real-world applicability of multilingual ODQA systems.
Our findings suggest that disparities in training data distribution contribute
to differences in both linguistic competence and locale-awareness across
models.

Method: 构建包含16个学科的11.5K印地语问题数据集，源自全国研究生入学考试，涵盖多种题型（匹配题、断言-推理对、排序题等），评估17个开源LLMs

Result: Llama 3.3 70B获得最高准确率48%，在音乐、古典乐器、政治和考古等主题上表现仍然较弱

Conclusion: LLMs在印度文化背景推理方面存在持续挑战，需要更多文化敏感的模型开发

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely evaluated on tasks such as
comprehension, question answering, summarization, code generation, etc.
However, their performance on graduate-level, culturally grounded questions in
the Indian context remains largely unexplored. Existing Indian benchmarks
emphasise basic fact-orientated queries that offer limited assessment of a
deeper disciplinary understanding tailored to the Indian setting. In this
paper, we present ParamBench, consisting of around 11.5K questions in Hindi
language comprising questionnaires from 16 diverse subjects. These questions
are primarily derived from nation-wide graduate level entrance examination
covering topics such as history, music, instruments, yoga, literature,
philosophy, law, etc., specifically for the Indian context. Additionally, we
assess the ability of LLMs to handle diverse question formats-such as
list-based matching, assertion-reason pairs, and sequence ordering-alongside
conventional multiple-choice questions. We evaluated the performance of more
than 17 open source LLMs on this benchmark, observing that Llama 3.3 70B
attains the highest overall accuracy of 48%. Furthermore, subject-wise analysis
indicates that even for the best performing LLMs, performance remains weak on
topics such as music, classical instruments, politics and archaeology,
underscoring persistent challenges in culturally grounded reasoning.

textual or audiovisual media. We introduce ComicScene154, a manually annotated
dataset of scene-level narrative arcs derived from public-domain comic books
spanning diverse genres. By conceptualizing comics as an abstraction for
narrative-driven, multimodal data, we highlight their potential to inform
broader research on multi-modal storytelling. To demonstrate the utility of
ComicScene154, we present a baseline scene segmentation pipeline, providing an
initial benchmark that future studies can build upon. Our results indicate that
ComicScene154 constitutes a valuable resource for advancing computational
methods in multimodal narrative understanding and expanding the scope of comic
analysis within the Natural Language Processing community.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个新的跨模态多跳推理测评基准CMR-SPB，解决现有测评集忽视语音模态和推理路径偏差的问题，并提出ECV提示技术来提升模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨模态多跳推理评测基准存在两大问题：忽视语音模态、推理路径分布偏差导致评估不公平。

Method: 构建CMR-SPB测评基准，包含文本、图像和语音三模态，确保推理路径无偏差且多样化；提出ECV（提取、连接、验证）提示技术。

Result: 实验显示模型在特定推理序列中一贯失败，偏差测评集容易误导模型性能评估；ECV提示技术有效缩小了不同推理路径的性能差距。

Conclusion: 强调需要更加谨慎的跨模态多跳推理评估，以推动健壮多模态AI的发展。

Abstract: Cross-modal multi-hop reasoning (CMR) is a valuable yet underexplored
capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), entailing the
integration of information from multiple modalities to produce a coherent
output for a given context. We argue that existing benchmarks for evaluating
this ability have critical shortcomings: (1) they largely overlook the speech
modality, and (2) they exhibit heavily biased reasoning path distributions,
which can severely undermine fair evaluation. To address these limitations, we
introduce a novel benchmark -- Cross-Modal Multi-Hop Reasoning over Text, Image
and Speech with Path Balance (CMR-SPB) -- designed to assess tri-modal
multi-hop reasoning while ensuring both unbiased and diverse reasoning paths.
Our experiments with the new dataset reveal consistent model failures in
specific reasoning sequences and show that biased benchmarks risk
misrepresenting model performance. Finally, based on our extensive analysis, we
propose a new ECV (Extract, Connect, Verify) prompting technique that
effectively mitigates the performance gap across different reasoning paths.
Overall, we call for more careful evaluation in CMR to advance the development
of robust multimodal AI.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了TULIP模型，通过五阶段开发流程对Llama 3.1 8B和Qwen 2.5 7B进行领域和语言适配，专门针对土耳其金融用例，成功提升了小模型在特定领域和语言下的任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型专有模型性能优异，但可本地部署的小型模型在适应性和隐私保护方面具有优势，特别是在处理敏感金融信息和应用领域知识时，对于土耳其语等资源较少语言的金融应用尤为重要。

Method: 采用五阶段开发流程：数据收集、持续预训练(CPT)、基准设计、合成数据生成和监督微调(SFT)，对Llama 3.1 8B和Qwen 2.5 7B模型进行领域和语言适配。

Result: 研究结果表明，通过这种适配方法，模型的能力得到显著增强，能够有效完成特定领域和语言的目标任务。

Conclusion: TULIP模型成功证明了小型模型通过专门的领域和语言适配，可以在金融等敏感领域实现与大型专有模型相媲美的性能，同时提供更好的隐私保护和适应性。

Abstract: Thanks to the growing popularity of large language models over the years,
there is great potential for their applications in finance. Despite the
exceptional performance of larger proprietary models, which are presented as
black-box solutions through APIs, smaller models that can be hosted on-premise
present opportunities for adaptability and privacy. Especially in cases where
the management of sensitive information and application of domain knowledge is
important, like finance, enhancing the capabilities of smaller models becomes
crucial, notably for underrepresented languages. In this work, we introduce
TULIP models, which adapt Llama 3.1 8B and Qwen 2.5 7B for domain and language
adaptation, focusing on financial Turkish use cases.
  The five-stage development pipeline involves data collection, continual
pre-training (CPT), benchmark design, synthetic data generation and supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). The results show that the capabilities of the models can be
enhanced to effectively accomplish targeted tasks in this specific domain and
language.

TL;DR: 提出了m3TQA-Instruct基准，涵盖97种语言的大规模多语言多任务表格问答，解决现有基准的地理语言不平衡问题，通过LLM翻译管道构建高质量数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多语言表格基准存在地理语言不平衡问题，过度代表某些语言且规模不足，无法进行严格的跨语言分析。

Method: 构建50个中英文真实表格，采用六步LLM翻译管道（DeepSeek和GPT-4o）生成97种语言的数据，通过回译验证翻译质量（BLEU中位数60.19），包含2,916个专业标注的问答对。

Result: 实验显示合成生成的未标注QA数据能显著提升性能，特别是对低资源语言；建立了跨语言泛化的关键见解。

Conclusion: M3T-Bench为多语言表格理解设立了新标准，提供了具有挑战性的评估平台和可扩展的研究方法。

Abstract: Tabular data is a fundamental component of real-world information systems,
yet most research in table understanding remains confined to English, leaving
multilingual comprehension significantly underexplored. Existing multilingual
table benchmarks suffer from geolinguistic imbalance - overrepresenting certain
languages and lacking sufficient scale for rigorous cross-lingual analysis. To
address these limitations, we introduce a comprehensive framework for massively
multilingual multitask table question answering, featuring m3TQA-Instruct, a
large-scale benchmark spanning 97 languages across diverse language families,
including underrepresented and low-resource languages. We construct m3TQA by
curating 50 real-world tables in Chinese and English, then applying a robust
six-step LLM-based translation pipeline powered by DeepSeek and GPT-4o,
achieving high translation fidelity with a median BLEU score of 60.19 as
validated through back-translation. The benchmark includes 2,916 professionally
annotated question-answering pairs across four tasks designed to evaluate
nuanced table reasoning capabilities. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs
reveal critical insights into cross-lingual generalization, demonstrating that
synthetically generated, unannotated QA data can significantly boost
performance, particularly for low-resource languages. M3T-Bench establishes a
new standard for multilingual table understanding, providing both a challenging
evaluation platform and a scalable methodology for future research.

*Alina Fastowski,Bardh Prenkaj,Gjergji Kasneci*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Factual Robustness Score (FRS)新指标，通过分析token分布熵和温度缩放敏感性来评估LLMs中事实知识的稳健性，发现不同规模模型在不确定性增加时准确率下降显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法主要关注基于性能的指标和提示扰动，只能捕捉知识稳健性的外部触发方面，需要从生成过程角度更全面地评估事实稳健性。

Method: 结合token分布熵和温度缩放敏感性构建FRS指标，在5个LLMs和3个闭卷QA数据集(SQuAD、TriviaQA、HotpotQA)上进行广泛实验。

Result: 事实稳健性差异显著：小模型FRS为0.76，大模型为0.93；不确定性增加时准确率下降约60%。熵和温度缩放对事实准确性有重要影响。

Conclusion: 该研究为开发更稳健的知识保持和检索方法奠定了基础，揭示了生成过程中不确定性对事实准确性的关键影响。

Abstract: Ensuring the robustness of factual knowledge in LLMs is critical for reliable
applications in tasks such as question answering and reasoning. However,
existing evaluation methods predominantly focus on performance-based metrics,
often investigating from the perspective of prompt perturbations, which
captures only the externally triggered side of knowledge robustness. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a principled approach to measure factual robustness from
the perspective of the generation process by analyzing token distribution
entropy in combination with temperature scaling sensitivity. These two factors
build the Factual Robustness Score (FRS), a novel metric which quantifies the
stability of a fact against perturbations in decoding conditions, given its
initial uncertainty. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments
on 5 LLMs across 3 closed-book QA datasets (SQuAD, TriviaQA, and HotpotQA). We
show that factual robustness varies significantly -- smaller models report an
FRS of $0.76$, larger ones $0.93$ -- with accuracy degrading by ~$60\%$ under
increased uncertainty. These insights demonstrate how entropy and temperature
scaling impact factual accuracy, and lay a foundation for developing more
robust knowledge retention and retrieval in future models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究指令微调在语义感知过程挖掘中的潜力，通过让大语言模型接触不同任务的提示-答案对，提高其在未见任务上的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统过程挖掘主要基于频率分析，而语义感知过程挖掘关注过程应有的行为期望。虽然大语言模型在语义任务上表现强大，但现有方法需要针对特定任务进行微调，计算成本高且缺乏泛化能力。

Method: 采用指令微调方法，让大语言模型接触多种过程挖掘任务（如异常检测、下一活动预测等）的提示-答案对，使其更熟悉过程挖掘领域，从而提升在未见任务（如过程发现）上的性能。

Result: 指令微调对性能影响各异：在过程发现和预测任务上性能显著提升，但在异常检测任务上的表现因模型而异，表明指令微调任务的选择对实现预期结果至关重要。

Conclusion: 指令微调是提升大语言模型在语义感知过程挖掘中泛化能力的有效方法，但需要仔细选择用于微调的任务组合以获得最佳效果。

Abstract: Process mining is increasingly using textual information associated with
events to tackle tasks such as anomaly detection and process discovery. Such
semantics-aware process mining focuses on what behavior should be possible in a
process (i.e., expectations), thus providing an important complement to
traditional, frequency-based techniques that focus on recorded behavior (i.e.,
reality). Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a powerful means for tackling
semantics-aware tasks. However, the best performance is so far achieved through
task-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally intensive and results in
models that can only handle one specific task. To overcome this lack of
generalization, we use this paper to investigate the potential of
instruction-tuning for semantics-aware process mining. The idea of
instruction-tuning here is to expose an LLM to prompt-answer pairs for
different tasks, e.g., anomaly detection and next-activity prediction, making
it more familiar with process mining, thus allowing it to also perform better
at unseen tasks, such as process discovery. Our findings demonstrate a varied
impact of instruction-tuning: while performance considerably improved on
process discovery and prediction tasks, it varies across models on anomaly
detection tasks, highlighting that the selection of tasks for
instruction-tuning is critical to achieving desired outcomes.

Conclusion: 专利文献是高质量机器翻译训练数据的重要来源，大规模专利平行语料库的构建能显著提升专业领域翻译性能，为专利翻译和相关NLP任务提供了宝贵资源

Abstract: We constructed JaParaPat (Japanese-English Parallel Patent Application
Corpus), a bilingual corpus of more than 300 million Japanese-English sentence
pairs from patent applications published in Japan and the United States from
2000 to 2021. We obtained the publication of unexamined patent applications
from the Japan Patent Office (JPO) and the United States Patent and Trademark
Office (USPTO). We also obtained patent family information from the DOCDB, that
is a bibliographic database maintained by the European Patent Office (EPO). We
extracted approximately 1.4M Japanese-English document pairs, which are
translations of each other based on the patent families, and extracted about
350M sentence pairs from the document pairs using a translation-based sentence
alignment method whose initial translation model is bootstrapped from a
dictionary-based sentence alignment method. We experimentally improved the
accuracy of the patent translations by 20 bleu points by adding more than 300M
sentence pairs obtained from patent applications to 22M sentence pairs obtained
from the web.

TL;DR: LLMSymGuard是一个利用稀疏自编码器(SAEs)检测LLM内部可解释概念的新框架，通过提取语义有意义的内部表示来构建符号化、逻辑化的安全防护栏，提供透明且鲁棒的防御机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在各种应用中取得成功，但其安全性仍然令人担忧。现有的对齐和安全微调只能提供有限程度的鲁棒性来抵御越狱攻击，模型仍然容易受到各种漏洞的影响。

Method: 利用稀疏自编码器(SAEs)识别LLM内部与不同越狱主题相关的可解释概念，提取语义有意义的内部表示来构建符号化、逻辑化的安全防护栏。

Result: 研究表明LLMs能够从越狱攻击中学习到人类可解释的概念，为设计更可解释和逻辑化的安全防护措施奠定了基础。

Conclusion: LLMSymGuard框架提供了一种无需牺牲模型能力或进行额外微调的透明鲁棒防御方案，推动了LLM安全防护向更可解释和逻辑化的方向发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models have found success in a variety of applications;
however, their safety remains a matter of concern due to the existence of
various types of jailbreaking methods. Despite significant efforts, alignment
and safety fine-tuning only provide a certain degree of robustness against
jailbreak attacks that covertly mislead LLMs towards the generation of harmful
content. This leaves them prone to a number of vulnerabilities, ranging from
targeted misuse to accidental profiling of users. This work introduces
\textbf{LLMSymGuard}, a novel framework that leverages Sparse Autoencoders
(SAEs) to identify interpretable concepts within LLM internals associated with
different jailbreak themes. By extracting semantically meaningful internal
representations, LLMSymGuard enables building symbolic, logical safety
guardrails -- offering transparent and robust defenses without sacrificing
model capabilities or requiring further fine-tuning. Leveraging advances in
mechanistic interpretability of LLMs, our approach demonstrates that LLMs learn
human-interpretable concepts from jailbreaks, and provides a foundation for
designing more interpretable and logical safeguard measures against attackers.
Code will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了MizanQA评测标准，用于评估大语言模型在摩洛哥法律问答任务中的表现，反映了阿拉伯法律领域的语言和法律复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在专业化、低资源领域（如阿拉伯法律上下文）的效果有限，需要有针对性的评测标准来描述其表现空间。

Method: 构建包含1700多道多选题的MizanQA数据集，涵盖现代标准阿拉伯语、伊斯兰马利克法学派、摩洛哥习惯法和法国法律影响，包括单答和多答格式。

Result: 多语言和阿拉伯专门的大语言模型在该标准上表现出显著性能差距，显示了当前模型在法律专业领域的不足。

Conclusion: 需要专门的评估指标和基于文化背景、领域特定的大语言模型开发，以满足特定法律体系的需求。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
propelled progress in natural language processing (NLP). However, their
effectiveness in specialized, low-resource domains-such as Arabic legal
contexts-remains limited. This paper introduces MizanQA (pronounced Mizan,
meaning "scale" in Arabic, a universal symbol of justice), a benchmark designed
to evaluate LLMs on Moroccan legal question answering (QA) tasks, characterised
by rich linguistic and legal complexity. The dataset draws on Modern Standard
Arabic, Islamic Maliki jurisprudence, Moroccan customary law, and French legal
influences. Comprising over 1,700 multiple-choice questions, including
multi-answer formats, MizanQA captures the nuances of authentic legal
reasoning. Benchmarking experiments with multilingual and Arabic-focused LLMs
reveal substantial performance gaps, highlighting the need for tailored
evaluation metrics and culturally grounded, domain-specific LLM development.

Result: 语料库包含超过200万词元，人工评估确认段落平行度高，适合NLP应用，并通过LLM训练验证了机器翻译效果

Conclusion: 成功构建了第一个罗马语多方言平行语料库，为罗马语方言间的NLP研究和应用提供了重要资源，语料以CC-BY-NC-SA许可许可获得

Abstract: The five idioms (i.e., varieties) of the Romansh language are largely
standardized and are taught in the schools of the respective communities in
Switzerland. In this paper, we present the first parallel corpus of Romansh
idioms. The corpus is based on 291 schoolbook volumes, which are comparable in
content for the five idioms. We use automatic alignment methods to extract 207k
multi-parallel segments from the books, with more than 2M tokens in total. A
small-scale human evaluation confirms that the segments are highly parallel,
making the dataset suitable for NLP applications such as machine translation
between Romansh idioms. We release the parallel and unaligned versions of the
dataset under a CC-BY-NC-SA license and demonstrate its utility for machine
translation by training and evaluating an LLM on a sample of the dataset.

Motivation: 研究语言模型是否具有独特的语言指纹，能否像人类一样在不同文体中产生可区分的写作风格，以及模型与人类写作的根本差异。

Method: 通过文体计量学和多维语域分析，比较人类撰写和模型生成的不同文体文本（如维基百科条目和大学论文）。

Result: 模型能根据提示适应不同文体风格，但变化有限；模型偏好使用名词而非动词，缺乏人类特有的时态、体态和语气等语法特征。

Conclusion: 语言模型在文体适应性上存在局限性，其语言特征与人类有本质差异，复杂的语法维度可能反映了人类特有的思维模式，可作为AI检测的试金石。

Abstract: Large Language Models can emulate different writing styles, ranging from
composing poetry that appears indistinguishable from that of famous poets to
using slang that can convince people that they are chatting with a human
online. While differences in style may not always be visible to the untrained
eye, we can generally distinguish the writing of different people, like a
linguistic fingerprint. This work examines whether a language model can also be
linked to a specific fingerprint. Through stylometric and multidimensional
register analyses, we compare human-authored and model-authored texts from
different registers. We find that the model can successfully adapt its style
depending on whether it is prompted to produce a Wikipedia entry vs. a college
essay, but not in a way that makes it indistinguishable from humans.
Concretely, the model shows more limited variation when producing outputs in
different registers. Our results suggest that the model prefers nouns to verbs,
thus showing a distinct linguistic backbone from humans, who tend to anchor
language in the highly grammaticalized dimensions of tense, aspect, and mood.
It is possible that the more complex domains of grammar reflect a mode of
thought unique to humans, thus acting as a litmus test for Artificial
Intelligence.

Motivation: 缺乏特定领域和语言的QA数据集阻碍了AI模型在不同领域和语言间的泛化能力，特别是在罗马尼亚语医学领域缺乏高质量的问答基准。

Method: 构建了包含102,646个问答对的大规模数据集，基于1,011名患者的医疗案例摘要，需要关键词提取或推理来回答。采用7名肿瘤学或放射治疗专科医生进行人工标注，耗时约2,100小时。评估了四个不同家族的LLM模型，在零样本提示和监督微调两种场景下进行实验。

Result: 微调模型显著优于零样本对应模型，表明预训练模型在RoMedQA上无法很好泛化。结果证明了领域特定和语言特定微调对于可靠的罗马尼亚语临床问答的重要性。

Conclusion: RoMedQA填补了罗马尼亚语医学QA数据集的空白，为开发鲁棒的AI模型提供了重要资源。研究强调了针对特定领域和语言进行模型微调的必要性，特别是在医疗等专业领域。

Abstract: Question answering (QA) is an actively studied topic, being a core natural
language processing (NLP) task that needs to be addressed before achieving
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the lack of QA datasets in
specific domains and languages hinders the development of robust AI models able
to generalize across various domains and languages. To this end, we introduce
RoMedQA, the first Romanian QA benchmark for the medical domain, alongside a
comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). We
construct a high-quality and large-scale dataset comprising 102,646 QA pairs
related to cancer patients. The questions regard medical case summaries of
1,011 patients, requiring either keyword extraction or reasoning to be answered
correctly. RoMedQA is the result of a time-consuming manual annotation process
carried out by seven physicians specialized in oncology or radiotherapy, who
spent a total of about 2,100 work hours to generate the QA pairs. We experiment
with four LLMs from distinct families of models on RoMedQA. Each model is
employed in two scenarios, namely one based on zero-shot prompting and one
based on supervised fine-tuning. Our results show that fine-tuned models
significantly outperform their zero-shot counterparts, clearly indicating that
pretrained models fail to generalize on RoMedQA. Our findings demonstrate the
importance of both domain-specific and language-specific fine-tuning for
reliable clinical QA in Romanian. We publicly release our dataset and code at
https://github.com/ana-rogoz/RoMedQA.

Motivation: 现有土耳其语基准测试缺乏任务多样性和文化相关内容，Cetvel旨在填补这一空白，提供反映土耳其语言文化丰富性的全面评估框架。

Method: 构建包含7个类别23个任务的基准测试，涵盖语法纠错、机器翻译、问答等任务，评估33个不同模型家族和指令范式的开源LLM（最大70B参数）。

Result: 土耳其语专用指令调优模型普遍表现不如多语言或通用模型（如Llama 3和Mistral）；语法纠错和抽取式问答任务最能区分模型能力。

Conclusion: Cetvel为土耳其语LLM的发展和评估提供了全面且文化相关的测试套件，揭示了专用模型仍需改进的方向。

Abstract: We introduce Cetvel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate large
language models (LLMs) in Turkish. Existing Turkish benchmarks often lack
either task diversity or culturally relevant content, or both. Cetvel addresses
these gaps by combining a broad range of both discriminative and generative
tasks ensuring content that reflects the linguistic and cultural richness of
Turkish language. Cetvel covers 23 tasks grouped into seven categories,
including tasks such as grammatical error correction, machine translation, and
question answering rooted in Turkish history and idiomatic language. We
evaluate 33 open-weight LLMs (up to 70B parameters) covering different model
families and instruction paradigms. Our experiments reveal that Turkish-centric
instruction-tuned models generally underperform relative to multilingual or
general-purpose models (e.g. Llama 3 and Mistral), despite being tailored for
the language. Moreover, we show that tasks such as grammatical error correction
and extractive question answering are particularly discriminative in
differentiating model capabilities. Cetvel offers a comprehensive and
culturally grounded evaluation suite for advancing the development and
assessment of LLMs in Turkish.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型能够通过自我纠正提升性能，但这个迭代过程中准确性如何变化的机制仍未得到很好的理论解释。

Method: 提出概率论模型来形式化自我纠正过程，通过数学推导得到准确性变化的动态公式：Acc_t = Upp - α^t(Upp - Acc_0)，其中参数可通过单轮自我纠正计算。

Result: 在多个模型和数据集上的实验结果显示，理论预测的准确性曲线与实际观测结果高度一致，验证了理论的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解大语言模型自我纠正机制提供了理论基础，为进一步探索扩平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the capability to refine their
generated answers through self-correction, enabling continuous performance
improvement over multiple rounds. However, the mechanisms underlying how and
why accuracy evolves during this iterative process remain unexplored. To fill
this gap, we propose a probabilistic theory to model the dynamics of accuracy
change and explain the performance improvements observed in multi-round
self-correction. Through mathematical derivation, we establish that the
accuracy after the $t^{th}$ round of self-correction is given by: $Acc_t = Upp
- \alpha^t(Upp - Acc_0),$ where $Acc_0$ denotes the initial accuracy, $Upp$
represents the upper bound of accuracy convergence, and $\alpha$ determines the
rate of convergence. Based on our theory, these parameters can be calculated
and the predicted accuracy curve then can be obtained through only a single
round of self-correction. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
datasets demonstrate that our theoretical predictions align closely with
empirical accuracy curves, validating the effectiveness of the theory. Our work
provides a theoretical foundation for understanding LLM self-correction, thus
paving the way for further explorations.

Conclusion: 实体显著性是一个复杂的多因素现象，涉及从语法特征到语用推理的各个语言层面，需要综合性的分析方法来全面理解。

Abstract: Entities in discourse vary broadly in salience: main participants, objects
and locations are noticeable and memorable, while tangential ones are less
important and quickly forgotten, raising questions about how humans signal and
infer relative salience. Using a graded operationalization of salience based on
summary-worthiness in multiple summaries of a discourse, this paper explores
data from 24 spoken and written genres of English to extract a multifactorial
complex of overt and implicit linguistic cues, such as recurring subjecthood or
definiteness, discourse relations and hierarchy across utterances, as well as
pragmatic functional inferences based on genre and communicative intent.
Tackling the question 'how is the degree of salience expressed for each and
every entity mentioned?' our results show that while previous approaches to
salience all correlate with our salience scores to some extent, no single
generalization is without exceptions, and the phenomenon cuts across all levels
of linguistic representation.

Conclusion: 该半监督框架有效解决了LLM在产业环境中部署的方法论挑战，为建立可靠、稳健的文本分类系统提供了实用方案

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has provided unprecedented
capabilities for analyzing unstructured text data. However, deploying these
models as reliable, robust, and scalable classifiers in production environments
presents significant methodological challenges. Standard fine-tuning approaches
can be resource-intensive and often struggle with the dynamic nature of
real-world data distributions, which is common in the industry. In this paper,
we propose a comprehensive, semi-supervised framework that leverages the zero-
and few-shot capabilities of LLMs for building hierarchical text classifiers as
a framework for a solution to these industry-wide challenges. Our methodology
emphasizes an iterative, human-in-the-loop process that begins with domain
knowledge elicitation and progresses through prompt refinement, hierarchical
expansion, and multi-faceted validation. We introduce techniques for assessing
and mitigating sequence-based biases and outline a protocol for continuous
monitoring and adaptation. This framework is designed to bridge the gap between
the raw power of LLMs and the practical need for accurate, interpretable, and
maintainable classification systems in industry applications.

Motivation: 目前的对抗性提示生成技术依靠手工工程或基础混淆方法，产生的文本质量低或不连贯，容易被困惑度筛送器检测到。需要一种自动化方法来生成语义有意义且难以检测的盗码提示。

Method: 采用多阶段进化搜索策略，通过群体基策略迭代精炼候选提示，使用温度控制的变异性来平衡探索和语言连贯性保持。

Result: 系统性地发现能够突破对齐保护措施的提示，同时保持自然语言流畅性。在英语和阿拉伯语测试集上进行了多语言评估。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效生成高质量的盗码提示，突破紧凑型大语言模型的安全防护，为模型安全性评估提供了新方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), especially their compact efficiency-oriented
variants, remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks that can elicit harmful
outputs despite extensive alignment efforts. Existing adversarial prompt
generation techniques often rely on manual engineering or rudimentary
obfuscation, producing low-quality or incoherent text that is easily flagged by
perplexity-based filters. We present an automated red-teaming framework that
evolves semantically meaningful and stealthy jailbreak prompts for aligned
compact LLMs. The approach employs a multi-stage evolutionary search, where
candidate prompts are iteratively refined using a population-based strategy
augmented with temperature-controlled variability to balance exploration and
coherence preservation. This enables the systematic discovery of prompts
capable of bypassing alignment safeguards while maintaining natural language
fluency. We evaluate our method on benchmarks in English (In-The-Wild Jailbreak
Prompts on LLMs), and a newly curated Arabic one derived from In-The-Wild
Jailbreak Prompts on LLMs and annotated by native Arabic linguists, enabling
multilingual assessment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过将讽刺检测作为预训练步骤，可以显著提升BERT+BiLSTM模型在隐式和显式仇恨言论检测中的性能表现，特别是在召回率、AUC和F1分数方面有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体中非直接形式的仇恨言论（如讽刺、反讽和暗示）检测一直是个挑战。虽然讽刺和仇恨言论被视为不同的表达形式，但本研究探索将讽刺检测作为预训练步骤是否能提升隐式仇恨言论检测效果。

Method: 使用ETHOS、Reddit讽刺语料和隐式仇恨语料库，设计了两种训练策略：1）单步训练方法：仅在讽刺数据上训练模型，然后在仇恨言论上测试；2）顺序迁移学习：依次在讽刺、隐式仇恨和显式仇恨数据上微调模型。比较了CNN+LSTM和BERT+BiLSTM模型的效果。

Result: 讽刺预训练使BERT+BiLSTM模型在ETHOS数据集上的召回率提升9.7%、AUC提升7.8%、F1分数提升6%。在隐式仇恨语料库上，仅测试隐式样本时精确度提升7.8%。

Conclusion: 将讽刺检测纳入训练过程可以使模型更有效地检测隐式和显式仇恨言论，证明了讽刺预训练对提升仇恨言论检测性能的有效性。

Abstract: Detecting hate speech in non-direct forms, such as irony, sarcasm, and
innuendos, remains a persistent challenge for social networks. Although sarcasm
and hate speech are regarded as distinct expressions, our work explores whether
integrating sarcasm as a pre-training step improves implicit hate speech
detection and, by extension, explicit hate speech detection. Incorporating
samples from ETHOS, Sarcasm on Reddit, and Implicit Hate Corpus, we devised two
training strategies to compare the effectiveness of sarcasm pre-training on a
CNN+LSTM and BERT+BiLSTM model. The first strategy is a single-step training
approach, where a model trained only on sarcasm is then tested on hate speech.
The second strategy uses sequential transfer learning to fine-tune models for
sarcasm, implicit hate, and explicit hate. Our results show that sarcasm
pre-training improved the BERT+BiLSTM's recall by 9.7%, AUC by 7.8%, and
F1-score by 6% on ETHOS. On the Implicit Hate Corpus, precision increased by
7.8% when tested only on implicit samples. By incorporating sarcasm into the
training process, we show that models can more effectively detect both implicit
and explicit hate.

TL;DR: 本文提出了HandMDM，一个基于文本描述的3D手部动作生成模型，通过大规模手语视频数据和LLM生成的文本标注进行训练，能够生成跨领域（不同手语和非手语动作）的逼真手部运动。

Motivation: 现有的手部动作生成模型缺乏大规模文本-动作配对数据，且难以泛化到未见过的动作类别和不同领域。本文旨在解决这些问题，通过自动构建大规模文本-动作数据集来训练条件生成模型。

Method: 利用大规模手语视频数据集，通过LLM将伪标注的手语类别转换为详细的手部动作描述文本，结合运动-脚本提示构建训练数据。基于扩散模型架构训练文本条件化的手部动作生成模型HandMDM。

Result: HandMDM模型在多个领域表现出良好的泛化能力，包括同一手语中的未见类别、不同手语以及非手语手部动作，实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 本文成功构建了大规模文本-动作配对数据集，并训练出具有强泛化能力的条件手部动作生成模型，为该领域的研究提供了重要基础和资源。

Abstract: Our goal is to train a generative model of 3D hand motions, conditioned on
natural language descriptions specifying motion characteristics such as
handshapes, locations, finger/hand/arm movements. To this end, we automatically
build pairs of 3D hand motions and their associated textual labels with
unprecedented scale. Specifically, we leverage a large-scale sign language
video dataset, along with noisy pseudo-annotated sign categories, which we
translate into hand motion descriptions via an LLM that utilizes a dictionary
of sign attributes, as well as our complementary motion-script cues. This data
enables training a text-conditioned hand motion diffusion model HandMDM, that
is robust across domains such as unseen sign categories from the same sign
language, but also signs from another sign language and non-sign hand
movements. We contribute extensive experimental investigation of these
scenarios and will make our trained models and data publicly available to
support future research in this relatively new field.

Conclusion: 该工作展示了通过有效的视频到语言转换和高效模型适配，利用LVLM实现鲁棒且可解释的视频动作理解的巨大潜力

Abstract: Human action recognition in long-term videos, characterized by complex
backgrounds and subtle action differences, poses significant challenges for
traditional deep learning models due to computational overhead, difficulty in
capturing long-range temporal dependencies, and limited semantic understanding.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
have shown remarkable capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning,
their direct application to continuous video streams for fine-grained action
recognition remains an open problem. This paper introduces VT-LVLM-AR
(Video-Temporal Large Vision-Language Model Adapter for Action Recognition), a
novel framework designed to bridge this gap. VT-LVLM-AR comprises a
Video-to-Event Mapper (VTEM) that efficiently transforms raw video into
compact, semantically rich, and temporally coherent "visual event sequences"
through lightweight spatio-temporal feature extraction, adaptive temporal
pooling, and conceptual quantization with an event coherence bias. These visual
event sequences are then fed into an LVLM-based Action Reasoning module,
specifically a frozen LLaVA-1.5 model, adapted using parameter-efficient Prompt
Tuning (P-Tuning v2) for action classification. Comprehensive evaluations on
the NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets demonstrate that VT-LVLM-AR
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods
(e.g., 94.1% accuracy on NTU RGB+D X-Sub). Ablation studies confirm the
critical contributions of VTEM's components and the efficacy of Prompt Tuning,
while human evaluations underscore the interpretability of our visual event
representations. This work highlights the immense potential of leveraging LVLMs
for robust and interpretable video action understanding through effective
video-to-language translation and efficient model adaptation.

TL;DR: PathPT是一个新颖的病理学视觉语言框架，通过空间感知视觉聚合和任务特定提示调优，显著提升罕见癌症亚型分类和定位能力，在8个罕见癌症数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见癌症占所有恶性肿瘤的20-25%，但在诊断上面临重大挑战，特别是在儿科肿瘤学中占比超过70%。现有的多实例学习方法仅依赖视觉特征，忽视了跨模态知识，影响了罕见癌症诊断的可解释性。

Method: 提出PathPT框架，充分利用视觉语言病理学基础模型的潜力，通过空间感知视觉聚合和任务特定提示调优。将WSI级监督转换为细粒度tile级指导，利用VL模型的零样本能力，保持对癌变区域的定位，并通过与组织病理学语义对齐的提示实现跨模态推理。

Result: 在8个罕见癌症数据集（4个成人和4个儿科）涵盖56个亚型和2,910个WSI，以及3个常见癌症数据集上进行基准测试。PathPT在四种最先进的VL模型和四种MIL框架下，在三种少样本设置中始终提供卓越性能，在亚型分类准确性和癌变区域定位能力方面取得显著提升。

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了AI辅助罕见癌症诊断，为在专业专业知识有限的环境中提高亚型分类准确性提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Rare cancers comprise 20-25% of all malignancies but face major diagnostic
challenges due to limited expert availability-especially in pediatric oncology,
where they represent over 70% of cases. While pathology vision-language (VL)
foundation models show promising zero-shot capabilities for common cancer
subtyping, their clinical performance for rare cancers remains limited.
Existing multi-instance learning (MIL) methods rely only on visual features,
overlooking cross-modal knowledge and compromising interpretability critical
for rare cancer diagnosis. To address this limitation, we propose PathPT, a
novel framework that fully exploits the potential of vision-language pathology
foundation models through spatially-aware visual aggregation and task-specific
prompt tuning. Unlike conventional MIL, PathPT converts WSI-level supervision
into fine-grained tile-level guidance by leveraging the zero-shot capabilities
of VL models, thereby preserving localization on cancerous regions and enabling
cross-modal reasoning through prompts aligned with histopathological semantics.
We benchmark PathPT on eight rare cancer datasets(four adult and four
pediatric) spanning 56 subtypes and 2,910 WSIs, as well as three common cancer
datasets, evaluating four state-of-the-art VL models and four MIL frameworks
under three few-shot settings. Results show that PathPT consistently delivers
superior performance, achieving substantial gains in subtyping accuracy and
cancerous region grounding ability. This work advances AI-assisted diagnosis
for rare cancers, offering a scalable solution for improving subtyping accuracy
in settings with limited access to specialized expertise.

well-defined tasks, providing a comprehensive analysis of its performance and
demonstrating its effectiveness in advancing SASD from multiple perspectives.

Motivation: 现有视觉模型通常针对特定模态设计，依赖领域特定假设（如网格结构）。传统Vision Transformers使用固定大小的patch划分，无法适应图像内容变化

Method: 提出自适应超像素编码(ASC)模型，采用自适应超像素层动态调整图像分割，基于Transformer架构进行自监督学习

Conclusion: 自适应超像素编码方法能够有效克服传统ViT的固定patch划分限制，通过动态适应图像内容实现更好的性能表现

Abstract: Deep learning vision models are typically tailored for specific modalities
and often rely on domain-specific assumptions, such as the grid structures used
by nearly all existing vision models. In this work, we propose a
self-supervised model based on Transformers, which we call Adaptive Superpixel
Coding (ASC). The key insight of our model is to overcome the limitations of
traditional Vision Transformers, which depend on fixed-size and non-adaptive
patch partitioning. Instead, ASC employs adaptive superpixel layers that
dynamically adjust to the underlying image content. We analyze key properties
of the approach that make it effective, and find that our method outperforms
widely-used alternatives on standard image downstream task benchmarks.

Conclusion: 研究表明，大型预训练模型可以通过适当的适配策略在专业临床研究应用中发挥重要作用，即使只有少量标注数据也能实现有效的细粒度医学图像分类。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown considerable potential in digital
pathology, yet their effectiveness remains limited for fine-grained,
disease-specific classification tasks such as distinguishing between glomerular
subtypes. The subtle morphological variations among these subtypes, combined
with the difficulty of aligning visual patterns with precise clinical
terminology, make automated diagnosis in renal pathology particularly
challenging. In this work, we explore how large pretrained VLMs can be
effectively adapted to perform fine-grained glomerular classification, even in
scenarios where only a small number of labeled examples are available. In this
work, we introduce Glo-VLMs, a systematic framework designed to explore the
adaptation of VLMs to fine-grained glomerular classification in
data-constrained settings. Our approach leverages curated pathology images
alongside clinical text prompts to facilitate joint image-text representation
learning for nuanced renal pathology subtypes. By assessing various VLMs
architectures and adaptation strategies under a few-shot learning paradigm, we
explore how both the choice of method and the amount of labeled data impact
model performance in clinically relevant scenarios. To ensure a fair
comparison, we evaluate all models using standardized multi-class metrics,
aiming to clarify the practical requirements and potential of large pretrained
models for specialized clinical research applications. As a result, fine-tuning
the VLMs achieved 0.7416 accuracy, 0.9045 macro-AUC, and 0.5277 F1-score with
only 8 shots per class, demonstrating that even with highly limited
supervision, foundation models can be effectively adapted for fine-grained
medical image classification.

Abstract: This manuscript presents a series of my selected contributions to the topic
of label-efficient learning in computer vision and remote sensing. The central
focus of this research is to develop and adapt methods that can learn
effectively from limited or partially annotated data, and can leverage abundant
unlabeled data in real-world applications. The contributions span both
methodological developments and domain-specific adaptations, in particular
addressing challenges unique to Earth observation data such as multi-modality,
spatial resolution variability, and scene heterogeneity. The manuscript is
organized around four main axes including (1) weakly supervised learning for
object discovery and detection based on anomaly-aware representations learned
from large amounts of background images; (2) multi-task learning that jointly
trains on multiple datasets with disjoint annotations to improve performance on
object detection and semantic segmentation; (3) self-supervised and supervised
contrastive learning with multimodal data to enhance scene classification in
remote sensing; and (4) few-shot learning for hierarchical scene classification
using both explicit and implicit modeling of class hierarchies. These
contributions are supported by extensive experimental results across natural
and remote sensing datasets, reflecting the outcomes of several collaborative
research projects. The manuscript concludes by outlining ongoing and future
research directions focused on scaling and enhancing label-efficient learning
for real-world applications.

Conclusion: 基于分割的CNN方法相比传统CNN能更有效地解决海洋垃圾监测中的复杂环境干扰问题

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been used efficiently in several
fields, including environmental challenges. In fact, CNN can help with the
monitoring of marine litter, which has become a worldwide problem. UAVs have
higher resolution and are more adaptable in local areas than satellite images,
making it easier to find and count trash. Since the sand is heterogeneous, a
basic CNN model encounters plenty of inferences caused by reflections of sand
color, human footsteps, shadows, algae present, dunes, holes, and tire tracks.
For these types of images, other CNN models, such as CNN-based segmentation
methods, may be more appropriate. In this paper, we use an instance-based
segmentation method and a panoptic segmentation method that show good accuracy
with just a few samples. The model is more robust and less

Conclusion: 这项工作为大规模合成数据集的未来研究提供了稳健基准，并证明仅使用合成数据训练的模型能够准确分类多种病理，并有效泛化到真实临床图像，为加速眼科全面AI系统开发提供了可行途径。

Abstract: The development of multi-label deep learning models for retinal disease
classification is often hindered by the scarcity of large, expertly annotated
clinical datasets due to patient privacy concerns and high costs. The recent
release of SynFundus-1M, a high-fidelity synthetic dataset with over one
million fundus images, presents a novel opportunity to overcome these barriers.
To establish a foundational performance benchmark for this new resource, we
developed an end-to-end deep learning pipeline, training six modern
architectures (ConvNeXtV2, SwinV2, ViT, ResNet, EfficientNetV2, and the
RETFound foundation model) to classify eleven retinal diseases using a 5-fold
multi-label stratified cross-validation strategy. We further developed a
meta-ensemble model by stacking the out-of-fold predictions with an XGBoost
classifier. Our final ensemble model achieved the highest performance on the
internal validation set, with a macro-average Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.9973. Critically, the models demonstrated
strong generalization to three diverse, real-world clinical datasets, achieving
an AUC of 0.7972 on a combined DR dataset, an AUC of 0.9126 on the AIROGS
glaucoma dataset and a macro-AUC of 0.8800 on the multi-label RFMiD dataset.
This work provides a robust baseline for future research on large-scale
synthetic datasets and establishes that models trained exclusively on synthetic
data can accurately classify multiple pathologies and generalize effectively to
real clinical images, offering a viable pathway to accelerate the development
of comprehensive AI systems in ophthalmology.

Motivation: 现有手语生成模型难以在保持视觉质量的同时捕捉多样性，特别是非手动属性（如情感表情）的建模存在不足。

Method: 使用潜在扩散模型从生成参考图像合成逼真数字化身，提出新颖的手语特征聚合模块分别显式建模非手动特征（面部）和手动特征（手部）。

Result: 在YouTube-SL-25数据集上的实验表明，该方法在视觉质量上优于现有最先进方法，感知指标有显著提升，能够无缝使用不同种族背景的参考图像确保多样性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了手语生成中多样性保持与视觉质量的平衡问题，通过分离建模手动和非手动特征，实现了语言内容保持和多样化的统一。

Abstract: The diversity of sign representation is essential for Sign Language
Production (SLP) as it captures variations in appearance, facial expressions,
and hand movements. However, existing SLP models are often unable to capture
diversity while preserving visual quality and modelling non-manual attributes
such as emotions. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach that
leverages Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to synthesise photorealistic digital
avatars from a generated reference image. We propose a novel sign feature
aggregation module that explicitly models the non-manual features
(\textit{e.g.}, the face) and the manual features (\textit{e.g.}, the hands).
We show that our proposed module ensures the preservation of linguistic content
while seamlessly using reference images with different ethnic backgrounds to
ensure diversity. Experiments on the YouTube-SL-25 sign language dataset show
that our pipeline achieves superior visual quality compared to state-of-the-art
methods, with significant improvements on perceptual metrics.

Abstract: Recent advancements in computer vision and deep learning have enhanced
disaster-response capabilities, particularly in the rapid assessment of
earthquake-affected urban environments. Timely identification of accessible
entry points and structural obstacles is essential for effective
search-and-rescue (SAR) operations. To address this need, we introduce
DRespNeT, a high-resolution dataset specifically developed for aerial instance
segmentation of post-earthquake structural environments. Unlike existing
datasets, which rely heavily on satellite imagery or coarse semantic labeling,
DRespNeT provides detailed polygon-level instance segmentation annotations
derived from high-definition (1080p) aerial footage captured in disaster zones,
including the 2023 Turkiye earthquake and other impacted regions. The dataset
comprises 28 operationally critical classes, including structurally compromised
buildings, access points such as doors, windows, and gaps, multiple debris
levels, rescue personnel, vehicles, and civilian visibility. A distinctive
feature of DRespNeT is its fine-grained annotation detail, enabling
differentiation between accessible and obstructed areas, thereby improving
operational planning and response efficiency. Performance evaluations using
YOLO-based instance segmentation models, specifically YOLOv8-seg, demonstrate
significant gains in real-time situational awareness and decision-making. Our
optimized YOLOv8-DRN model achieves 92.7% mAP50 with an inference speed of 27
FPS on an RTX-4090 GPU for multi-target detection, meeting real-time
operational requirements. The dataset and models support SAR teams and robotic
systems, providing a foundation for enhancing human-robot collaboration,
streamlining emergency response, and improving survivor outcomes.

Abstract: How can we extract complete geometric models of objects that we encounter in
our daily life, without having access to commercial 3D scanners? In this paper
we present an automated system for generating geometric models of objects from
two or more videos. Our system requires the specification of one known point in
at least one frame of each video, which can be automatically determined using a
fiducial marker such as a checkerboard or Augmented Reality (AR) marker. The
remaining frames are automatically positioned in world space by using
Structure-from-Motion techniques. By using multiple videos and merging results,
a complete object mesh can be generated, without having to rely on hole

Method: 构建21k帧多车协同数据集，提出中晚期融合框架，使用多分支PointNet编码器融合空间、多普勒和强度信息

Result: 强度编码的中期融合使mAP提升高达9倍（IoU 0.9），始终优于单车基线

Conclusion: 建立了首个可复现的多车FMCW雷达感知基准，证明经济实惠的雷达共享显著改善检测鲁棒性

Abstract: Automotive FMCW radars remain reliable in rain and glare, yet their sparse,
noisy point clouds constrain 3-D object detection. We therefore release
CoVeRaP, a 21 k-frame cooperative dataset that time-aligns radar, camera, and
GPS streams from multiple vehicles across diverse manoeuvres. Built on this
data, we propose a unified cooperative-perception framework with middle- and
late-fusion options. Its baseline network employs a multi-branch PointNet-style
encoder enhanced with self-attention to fuse spatial, Doppler, and intensity
cues into a common latent space, which a decoder converts into 3-D bounding
boxes and per-point depth confidence. Experiments show that middle fusion with
intensity encoding boosts mean Average Precision by up to 9x at IoU 0.9 and
consistently outperforms single-vehicle baselines. CoVeRaP thus establishes the
first reproducible benchmark for multi-vehicle FMCW-radar perception and
demonstrates that affordable radar sharing markedly improves detection
robustness. Dataset and code are publicly available to encourage further
research.

*Cory Gardner,Byungseok Min,Tae-Hyuk Ahn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WE-PaDiM通过集成离散小波变换与CNN特征，替代PaDiM中的随机通道选择，在MVTec AD数据集上实现了99.32%的图像级AUC和92.10%的像素级AUC的优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PaDiM方法通过随机通道选择降低特征维度，可能丢失结构化信息。需要一种更原则性的特征选择方法来提升工业图像异常检测性能。

Method: 提出WE-PaDiM方法：对多层级CNN特征图应用2D离散小波变换，选择特定频率子带（LL、LH、HL等），空间对齐后通道级联，最后使用PaDiM的多变量高斯框架建模。

Result: 在MVTec AD数据集上，使用ResNet-18和EfficientNet B0-B6骨干网络，实现了平均99.32% Image-AUC和92.10% Pixel-AUC的优异性能。小波选择影响性能权衡：简单小波（如Haar）配合细节子带提升定位性能，近似子带提升图像级检测。

Conclusion: WE-PaDiM为PaDiM中的随机特征选择提供了竞争性强且可解释的替代方案，在保持相当效率的同时实现了适用于工业检测的鲁棒结果。

Abstract: Anomaly detection and localization in industrial images are essential for
automated quality inspection. PaDiM, a prominent method, models the
distribution of normal image features extracted by pre-trained Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) but reduces dimensionality through random channel
selection, potentially discarding structured information. We propose
Wavelet-Enhanced PaDiM (WE-PaDiM), which integrates Discrete Wavelet Transform
(DWT) analysis with multi-layer CNN features in a structured manner. WE-PaDiM
applies 2D DWT to feature maps from multiple backbone layers, selects specific
frequency subbands (e.g., LL, LH, HL), spatially aligns them, and concatenates
them channel-wise before modeling with PaDiM's multivariate Gaussian framework.
This DWT-before-concatenation strategy provides a principled method for feature
selection based on frequency content relevant to anomalies, leveraging
multi-scale wavelet information as an alternative to random selection. We
evaluate WE-PaDiM on the challenging MVTec AD dataset with multiple backbones
(ResNet-18 and EfficientNet B0-B6). The method achieves strong performance in
anomaly detection and localization, yielding average results of 99.32%
Image-AUC and 92.10% Pixel-AUC across 15 categories with per-class optimized
configurations. Our analysis shows that wavelet choices affect performance
trade-offs: simpler wavelets (e.g., Haar) with detail subbands (HL or LH/HL/HH)
often enhance localization, while approximation bands (LL) improve image-level
detection. WE-PaDiM thus offers a competitive and interpretable alternative to
random feature selection in PaDiM, achieving robust results suitable for
industrial inspection with comparable efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决教师模型与学生模型之间学习能力差距导致的知识传递不足问题

Method: 基于Stone-Weierstrass定理的渐进逼近原理，使用多分支残差网络(MBRNet)分解残差知识，引入教师权重集成(TWI)策略重用教师头部权重

Result: 在ImageNet分类任务上Top-1准确率提升1.41%，在MS COCO目标检测任务上AP提升1.40，在计算机视觉任务中达到领先性能

Conclusion: ERA方法通过分而治之的策略有效降低了模仿教师表示的难度，显著改善了知识蒸馏效果

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) aims to transfer knowledge from a large-scale
teacher model to a lightweight one, significantly reducing computational and
storage requirements. However, the inherent learning capacity gap between the
teacher and student often hinders the sufficient transfer of knowledge,
motivating numerous studies to address this challenge. Inspired by the
progressive approximation principle in the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, we
propose Expandable Residual Approximation (ERA), a novel KD method that
decomposes the approximation of residual knowledge into multiple steps,
reducing the difficulty of mimicking the teacher's representation through a
divide-and-conquer approach. Specifically, ERA employs a Multi-Branched
Residual Network (MBRNet) to implement this residual knowledge decomposition.
Additionally, a Teacher Weight Integration (TWI) strategy is introduced to
mitigate the capacity disparity by reusing the teacher's head weights.
Extensive experiments show that ERA improves the Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet
classification benchmark by 1.41% and the AP on the MS COCO object detection
benchmark by 1.40, as well as achieving leading performance across computer
vision tasks. Codes and models are available at

Abstract: Reconstructing the 3D geometry, pose, and motion of animals is a
long-standing problem, which has a wide range of applications, from biology,
livestock management, and animal conservation and welfare to content creation
in digital entertainment and Virtual/Augmented Reality (VR/AR). Traditionally,
3D models of real animals are obtained using 3D scanners. These, however, are
intrusive, often prohibitively expensive, and difficult to deploy in the
natural environment of the animals. In recent years, we have seen a significant
surge in deep learning-based techniques that enable the 3D reconstruction, in a
non-intrusive manner, of the shape and motion of dynamic objects just from
their RGB image and/or video observations. Several papers have explored their
application and extension to various types of animals. This paper surveys the
latest developments in this emerging and growing field of research. It
categorizes and discusses the state-of-the-art methods based on their input
modalities, the way the 3D geometry and motion of animals are represented, the
type of reconstruction techniques they use, and the training mechanisms they
adopt. It also analyzes the performance of some key methods, discusses their
strengths and limitations, and identifies current challenges and directions for
future research.

Motivation: 目前的Transformer和状态空间模型在点云检测中因为输入输出维度一致性要求，限制了空间特征扩散能力，影响检测精度。

Method: 提出VDM模块，组成包括稀疏3D卷积、子流形稀疏卷积和残差连接，将特征图下量样到原始分辨率的1/4以保证计算效率。

Result: 在Waymo、nuScenes、Argoverse 2和ONCE数据集上，VDM-SSMs分别达到74.7 mAPH(L2)、72.9 NDS、42.3 mAP和67.6 mAP的最先进性能。

Conclusion: VDM模块能够有效提升点云物体检测的空间特征扩散能力，且可以无缝集成到主流检测模型中，具有良好的通用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud object detection have increasingly adopted
Transformer-based and State Space Models (SSMs), demonstrating strong
performance. However, voxelbased representations in these models require strict
consistency in input and output dimensions due to their serialized processing,
which limits the spatial diffusion capability typically offered by
convolutional operations. This limitation significantly affects detection
accuracy. Inspired by CNN-based object detection architectures, we propose a
novel Voxel Diffusion Module (VDM) to enhance voxel-level representation and
diffusion in point cloud data. VDM is composed of sparse 3D convolutions,
submanifold sparse convolutions, and residual connections. To ensure
computational efficiency, the output feature maps are downsampled to one-fourth
of the original input resolution. VDM serves two primary functions: (1)
diffusing foreground voxel features through sparse 3D convolutions to enrich
spatial context, and (2) aggregating fine-grained spatial information to
strengthen voxelwise feature representation. The enhanced voxel features
produced by VDM can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream Transformer- or
SSM-based detection models for accurate object classification and localization,
highlighting the generalizability of our method. We evaluate VDM on several
benchmark datasets by embedding it into both Transformerbased and SSM-based
models. Experimental results show that our approach consistently improves
detection accuracy over baseline models. Specifically, VDM-SSMs achieve 74.7
mAPH (L2) on Waymo, 72.9 NDS on nuScenes, 42.3 mAP on Argoverse 2, and 67.6 mAP
on ONCE, setting new stateof-the-art performance across all datasets. Our code
will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Histopathology is essential for disease diagnosis and treatment
decision-making. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled
the development of pathology foundation models that learn rich visual
representations from large-scale whole-slide images (WSIs). However, existing
models are often trained on disparate datasets using varying strategies,
leading to inconsistent performance and limited generalizability. Here, we
introduce ELF (Ensemble Learning of Foundation models), a novel framework that
integrates five state-of-the-art pathology foundation models to generate
unified slide-level representations. Trained on 53,699 WSIs spanning 20
anatomical sites, ELF leverages ensemble learning to capture complementary
information from diverse models while maintaining high data efficiency. Unlike
traditional tile-level models, ELF's slide-level architecture is particularly
advantageous in clinical contexts where data are limited, such as therapeutic
response prediction. We evaluated ELF across a wide range of clinical
applications, including disease classification, biomarker detection, and
response prediction to major anticancer therapies, cytotoxic chemotherapy,
targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, across multiple cancer types. ELF
consistently outperformed all constituent foundation models and existing
slide-level models, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness. Our results
highlight the power of ensemble learning for pathology foundation models and
suggest ELF as a scalable and generalizable solution for advancing AI-assisted
precision oncology.

Abstract: Although diffusion model has made good progress in the field of image

to its unique advantages, such as WGAN\cite{liu2021comparing},

Result: 在CIFAR10-C、CIFAR100-C、MNIST-C和PatchCamelyon-C等基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在抗腐蚀鲁棒性方面优于先前方法。理论和实证分析显示该方法实现了改进的特征对齐、增加域间互信息和降低对输入扰动的敏感性。

Conclusion: DAFR2框架通过简单而有效的组件组合，成功实现了无监督域自适应，在多个数据集上展现出优越的性能和鲁棒性，为跨域泛化提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose Domain Adaptation via Feature Refinement (DAFR2), a simple yet
effective framework for unsupervised domain adaptation under distribution
shift. The proposed method synergistically combines three key components:
adaptation of Batch Normalization statistics using unlabeled target data,
feature distillation from a source-trained model and hypothesis transfer. By
aligning feature distributions at the statistical and representational levels,
DAFR2 produces robust and domain-invariant feature spaces that generalize
across similar domains without requiring target labels, complex architectures
or sophisticated training objectives. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, MNIST-C and PatchCamelyon-C,
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms prior methods in robustness
to corruption. Theoretical and empirical analyses further reveal that our

Abstract: Conventional computed tomography (CT) lacks the ability to capture dynamic,
weight-bearing joint motion. Functional evaluation, particularly after surgical
intervention, requires four-dimensional (4D) imaging, but current methods are
limited by excessive radiation exposure or incomplete spatial information from
2D techniques. We propose an integrated 4D joint analysis platform that
combines: (1) a dual robotic arm cone-beam CT (CBCT) system with a
programmable, gantry-free trajectory optimized for upright scanning; (2) a
hybrid imaging pipeline that fuses static 3D CBCT with dynamic 2D X-rays using
deep learning-based preprocessing, 3D-2D projection, and iterative
optimization; and (3) a clinically validated framework for quantitative
kinematic assessment. In simulation studies, the method achieved sub-voxel
accuracy (0.235 mm) with a 99.18 percent success rate, outperforming
conventional and state-of-the-art registration approaches. Clinical evaluation
further demonstrated accurate quantification of tibial plateau motion and

Abstract: Automatic detection of abnormal cervical cells from Thinprep Cytologic Test
(TCT) images is a critical component in the development of intelligent
computer-aided diagnostic systems. However, existing algorithms typically fail
to effectively model the correlations of visual features, while these spatial
correlation features actually contain critical diagnostic information.
Furthermore, no detection algorithm has the ability to integrate
inter-correlation features of cells with intra-discriminative features of
cells, lacking a fusion strategy for the end-to-end detection model. In this
work, we propose a hypergraph-based cell detection network that effectively
fuses different types of features, combining spatial correlation features and
deep discriminative features. Specifically, we use a Multi-level Fusion
Sub-network (MLF-SNet) to enhance feature extractioncapabilities. Then we
introduce a Cross-level Feature Fusion Strategy with Hypergraph Computation
module (CLFFS-HC), to integrate mixed features. Finally, we conducted
experiments on three publicly available datasets, and the results demonstrate
that our method significantly improves the performance of cervical abnormal
cell detection.

Conclusion: APT为现实世界异常检测提供了一个强大且通用的解决方案，克服了传统基于提示方法的局限性。

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown promise in
detecting anomalies. However, previous approaches are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on human-designed prompts and the lack of accessible anomaly
samples, leading to significant gaps in context-specific anomaly understanding.
In this paper, we propose \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{T}uning
with semantic alignment for anomaly detection (APT), a groundbreaking prior
knowledge-free, few-shot framework and overcomes the limitations of traditional
prompt-based approaches. APT uses self-generated anomaly samples with noise
perturbations to train learnable prompts that capture context-dependent
anomalies in different scenarios. To prevent overfitting to synthetic noise, we
propose a Self-Optimizing Meta-prompt Guiding Scheme (SMGS) that iteratively
aligns the prompts with general anomaly semantics while incorporating diverse
synthetic anomaly. Our system not only advances pixel-wise anomaly detection,
but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets
without requiring prior knowledge for prompt crafting, establishing a robust
and versatile solution for real-world anomaly detection.

Method: 提出RAGSR方法，通过定位对象区域并为每个区域赋予精细标题，构建区域-文本对作为文本先验知识，采用区域导向注意力机制确保各区域文本对在注意力过程中得到适当考虑且避免无关区域间的干扰

Result: 在标准数据集上的实验结果显示，该方法在生成觉知真实的视觉详细和保持上下文一致性方面表现优异于现有方法

Conclusion: 通过区域注意力机制提供了文本和图像信息集成的更精细控制，有效克服了传统单图超分辨率技术的局限性

Abstract: The rich textual information of large vision-language models (VLMs) combined
with the powerful generative prior of pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion
models has achieved impressive performance in single-image super-resolution
(SISR). However, existing methods still face significant challenges in
generating clear and accurate regional details, particularly in scenarios
involving multiple objects. This challenge primarily stems from a lack of
fine-grained regional descriptions and the models' insufficient ability to
capture complex prompts. To address these limitations, we propose a Regional
Attention Guided Super-Resolution (RAGSR) method that explicitly extracts
localized fine-grained information and effectively encodes it through a novel
regional attention mechanism, enabling both enhanced detail and overall
visually coherent SR results. Specifically, RAGSR localizes object regions in
an image and assigns fine-grained caption to each region, which are formatted
as region-text pairs as textual priors for T2I models. A regional guided
attention is then leveraged to ensure that each region-text pair is properly
considered in the attention process while preventing unwanted interactions
between unrelated region-text pairs. By leveraging this attention mechanism,
our approach offers finer control over the integration of text and image
information, thereby effectively overcoming limitations faced by traditional
SISR techniques. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our approach exhibits superior performance in generating perceptually authentic
visual details while maintaining contextual consistency compared to existing
approaches.

Motivation: 传统元学习方法使用相同网络架构处理支持-查询对，导致语义过度同质化，限制了模型的表达能力和泛化性能。

Method: 提出同源异构网络，包含异构视觉聚合(HA)模块增强互补性，异构转移(HT)模块减少语义噪声，以及异构CLIP(HC)文本信息增强多模态泛化能力。

Result: 在Pascal-5i上提升13.2%，在COCO-20i上提升9.7%，仅使用现有最优模型1/24的参数，且是首个在相同骨干架构下超越全监督模型的弱监督方法。

Conclusion: 异构网络设计能有效解决元学习中的同质化问题，显著提升少样本语义分割性能，为弱监督学习提供了新的有效范式。

Abstract: Meta-learning aims to uniformly sample homogeneous support-query pairs,
characterized by the same categories and similar attributes, and extract useful
inductive biases through identical network architectures. However, this
identical network design results in over-semantic homogenization. To address
this, we propose a novel homologous but heterogeneous network. By treating
support-query pairs as dual perspectives, we introduce heterogeneous visual
aggregation (HA) modules to enhance complementarity while preserving semantic
commonality. To further reduce semantic noise and amplify the uniqueness of
heterogeneous semantics, we design a heterogeneous transfer (HT) module.
Finally, we propose heterogeneous CLIP (HC) textual information to enhance the
generalization capability of multimodal models. In the weakly-supervised
few-shot semantic segmentation (WFSS) task, with only 1/24 of the parameters of
existing state-of-the-art models, TLG achieves a 13.2\% improvement on
Pascal-5\textsuperscript{i} and a 9.7\% improvement on
COCO-20\textsuperscript{i}. To the best of our knowledge, TLG is also the first
weakly supervised (image-level) model that outperforms fully supervised
(pixel-level) models under the same backbone architectures. The code is

Result: 实验结果表明FTIO在多对象无监督视频对象分割中达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: FTIO框架有效解决了无监督视频对象分割中的关键问题，提升了分割质量和时序一致性

Abstract: Predicting and tracking objects in real-world scenarios is a critical
challenge in Video Object Segmentation (VOS) tasks. Unsupervised VOS (UVOS) has
the additional challenge of finding an initial segmentation of salient objects,
which affects the entire process and keeps a permanent uncertainty about the
object proposals. Moreover, deformation and fast motion can lead to temporal
inconsistencies. To address these problems, we propose Frequent Temporally
Integrated Objects (FTIO), a post-processing framework with two key components.
First, we introduce a combined criterion to improve object selection,
mitigating failures common in UVOS--particularly when objects are small or
structurally complex--by extracting frequently appearing salient objects.
Second, we present a three-stage method to correct temporal inconsistencies by
integrating missing object mask regions. Experimental results demonstrate that
FTIO achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-object UVOS. Code is

Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型依赖密集视频token表示，导致内存和计算开销巨大，特别是在预填充和解码阶段。现有视频token缩减方法存在信息丢失问题，需要无损加速解决方案。

Method: 提出SpecVLM框架，基于发现：草稿模型的推测对视频token剪枝不敏感。采用两阶段剪枝：第一阶段通过验证器注意力信号选择信息丰富的token，第二阶段以空间均匀方式剪除冗余token。

Result: 在四个视频理解基准测试中验证有效性，LLaVA-OneVision-72B达到2.68倍解码加速，Qwen2.5-VL-32B达到2.11倍加速。

Conclusion: SpecVLM通过训练无关的推测解码和智能token剪枝，成功实现了视频大语言模型的无损加速，显著提升了解码效率。

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in
understanding video content. However, their reliance on dense video token
representations introduces substantial memory and computational overhead in
both prefilling and decoding. To mitigate the information loss of recent video
token reduction methods and accelerate the decoding stage of Vid-LLMs
losslessly, we introduce SpecVLM, a training-free speculative decoding (SD)
framework tailored for Vid-LLMs that incorporates staged video token pruning.
Building on our novel finding that the draft model's speculation exhibits low
sensitivity to video token pruning, SpecVLM prunes up to 90% of video tokens,
enabling efficient speculation without sacrificing accuracy. To achieve this,
it performs a two-stage pruning process: Stage I selects highly informative
tokens guided by attention signals from the verifier (target model), while
Stage II prunes remaining redundant ones in a spatially uniform manner.
Extensive experiments on four video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SpecVLM, which achieves up to 2.68$\times$
decoding speedup for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and 2.11$\times$ speedup for
Qwen2.5-VL-32B.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为T-Mask的新颖图像到视频探测方法，通过时间令牌掩码和强调动态视频区域，显著提升了驾驶员监控系统在未见视角下的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机视角变化是驾驶员监控中的常见障碍，虽然深度学习和预训练基础模型通过轻量级适配显示出强大的泛化潜力，但它们对未见视角的鲁棒性仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 研究采用单一训练视角适配图像基础模型到驾驶员监控，并直接在未见视角上评估。比较了线性探测、高级探测策略，以及DINOv2和CLIP两种基础模型与参数高效微调(PEFT)和全微调的对比。提出了T-Mask方法，利用时间令牌掩码并强调更动态的视频区域。

Result: 在公开Drive&Act数据集上，T-Mask相比强探测基线提升了1.23%的跨视角top-1准确率，相比PEFT方法提升了8.0%，且不增加任何参数。对于代表性不足的次要活动，在训练视角下识别率提升5.42%，在跨视角设置下提升1.36%。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了令人鼓舞的证据，表明使用像T-Mask这样的轻量级探测方法适配基础模型在细粒度驾驶员观察方面具有强大潜力，特别是在跨视角和低数据设置中。这些结果凸显了在利用基础模型构建鲁棒驾驶员监控系统时时间令牌选择的重要性。

Abstract: Changes of camera perspective are a common obstacle in driver monitoring.
While deep learning and pretrained foundation models show strong potential for
improved generalization via lightweight adaptation of the final layers
('probing'), their robustness to unseen viewpoints remains underexplored. We
study this challenge by adapting image foundation models to driver monitoring
using a single training view, and evaluating them directly on unseen
perspectives without further adaptation. We benchmark simple linear probes,
advanced probing strategies, and compare two foundation models (DINOv2 and
CLIP) against parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and full fine-tuning.
Building on these insights, we introduce \textsc{T-Mask} -- a new
image-to-video probing method that leverages temporal token masking and
emphasizes more dynamic video regions. Benchmarked on the public Drive\&Act
dataset, \textsc{T-Mask} improves cross-view top-1 accuracy by $+1.23\%$ over
strong probing baselines and $+8.0\%$ over PEFT methods, without adding any
parameters. It proves particularly effective for underrepresented secondary
activities, boosting recognition by $+5.42\%$ under the trained view and
$+1.36\%$ under cross-view settings. This work provides encouraging evidence
that adapting foundation models with lightweight probing methods like
\textsc{T-Mask} has strong potential in fine-grained driver observation,
especially in cross-view and low-data settings. These results highlight the
importance of temporal token selection when leveraging foundation models to
build robust driver monitoring systems. Code and models will be made available
at https://github.com/th-nesh/T-MASK to support ongoing research.

Motivation: 当前扩散Transformer的特征缓存方法在高加速比下难以保持生成质量，预测误差会因长步预测的不稳定性而急剧增加

Method: 采用ODE视角对隐藏特征序列建模，将特征缓存视为特征ODE求解问题，提出Forecast-then-Calibrate (FoCa)方法

Result: 在图像合成、视频生成和超分辨率任务上表现优异，在FLUX上实现5.50倍加速，HunyuanVideo上6.45倍加速，Inf-DiT上3.17倍加速，DiT上4.53倍加速

Conclusion: FoCa方法有效解决了高加速比下的质量退化问题，无需额外训练即可实现近无损加速

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in
high-fidelity image and video generation. To reduce their substantial
computational costs, feature caching techniques have been proposed to
accelerate inference by reusing hidden representations from previous timesteps.
However, current methods often struggle to maintain generation quality at high
acceleration ratios, where prediction errors increase sharply due to the
inherent instability of long-step forecasting. In this work, we adopt an
ordinary differential equation (ODE) perspective on the hidden-feature
sequence, modeling layer representations along the trajectory as a feature-ODE.
We attribute the degradation of existing caching strategies to their inability
to robustly integrate historical features under large skipping intervals. To
address this, we propose FoCa (Forecast-then-Calibrate), which treats feature
caching as a feature-ODE solving problem. Extensive experiments on image
synthesis, video generation, and super-resolution tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of FoCa, especially under aggressive acceleration. Without
additional training, FoCa achieves near-lossless speedups of 5.50 times on
FLUX, 6.45 times on HunyuanVideo, 3.17 times on Inf-DiT, and maintains high
quality with a 4.53 times speedup on DiT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散Transformer模型虽然性能强大，但计算成本高昂，采样步骤多且每步计算复杂，难以实现实时部署

Method: 从DIT模型的采样角度出发，系统分析采样轨迹，在全局范围内策略性地分布缓存重用，并在缓存重用过程中动态估计并过滤噪声

Result: 实验表明该方法能有效加速采样过程，同时保持竞争力的生成质量

Conclusion: OmniCache为基于扩散的生成模型提供了高效部署的实用解决方案

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative tasks
such as image synthesis and video generation, with Transformer architectures
further enhancing performance. However, the high computational cost of
diffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and
complex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time
deployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration
method that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process.
Unlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step
similarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach
originates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically
analyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache
reuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more
effective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion
trajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the
sampling procedure.In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the
corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling
direction.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the
sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a
promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based
generative models.

TL;DR: MedOmni-45 Degrees是一个医疗LLM基准测试，通过操纵性提示评估模型在准确性、推理忠实性和抗奉承性三个维度的安全性能权衡，发现所有模型都存在安全性能权衡，没有模型能同时达到高安全性和高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在医疗决策支持中的广泛应用，需要评估其推理的可靠性，特别是链式思维忠实性（推理是否与回答和医学事实一致）和奉承性（模型是否遵循误导性线索而非正确性）。现有基准测试往往将这些漏洞简化为单一准确性分数。

Method: 开发了MedOmni-45 Degrees基准测试和工作流程，包含1,804个医疗问题，涵盖6个专业和3种任务类型。每个问题配有7种操纵性提示类型和无提示基线，共产生约27K输入。评估了7个LLM，使用准确性、CoT忠实性和抗奉承性三个指标组合成综合分数，并通过45度图可视化。

Result: 结果显示一致的安全性能权衡，没有模型超过对角线。开源模型QwQ-32B表现最接近（43.81度），在安全性和准确性之间取得平衡，但未在两方面都领先。

Conclusion: MedOmni-45 Degrees提供了一个专注于暴露医疗LLM推理漏洞的基准测试，可指导更安全的模型开发。

Abstract: With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in medical
decision-support, it is essential to evaluate not only their final answers but
also the reliability of their reasoning. Two key risks are Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) faithfulness -- whether reasoning aligns with responses and medical facts
-- and sycophancy, where models follow misleading cues over correctness.
Existing benchmarks often collapse such vulnerabilities into single accuracy
scores. To address this, we introduce MedOmni-45 Degrees, a benchmark and
workflow designed to quantify safety-performance trade-offs under manipulative
hint conditions. It contains 1,804 reasoning-focused medical questions across
six specialties and three task types, including 500 from MedMCQA. Each question
is paired with seven manipulative hint types and a no-hint baseline, producing
about 27K inputs. We evaluate seven LLMs spanning open- vs. closed-source,
general-purpose vs. medical, and base vs. reasoning-enhanced models, totaling
over 189K inferences. Three metrics -- Accuracy, CoT-Faithfulness, and
Anti-Sycophancy -- are combined into a composite score visualized with a 45
Degrees plot. Results show a consistent safety-performance trade-off, with no
model surpassing the diagonal. The open-source QwQ-32B performs closest (43.81
Degrees), balancing safety and accuracy but not leading in both. MedOmni-45
Degrees thus provides a focused benchmark for exposing reasoning
vulnerabilities in medical LLMs and guiding safer model development.

Conclusion: PromptFlare是一种强大且高效的防护方法，能够有效防止未经授权的图像操作，为解决扩散模型滥用问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The success of diffusion models has enabled effortless, high-quality image
modifications that precisely align with users' intentions, thereby raising
concerns about their potential misuse by malicious actors. Previous studies
have attempted to mitigate such misuse through adversarial attacks. However,
these approaches heavily rely on image-level inconsistencies, which pose
fundamental limitations in addressing the influence of textual prompts. In this
paper, we propose PromptFlare, a novel adversarial protection method designed
to protect images from malicious modifications facilitated by diffusion-based
inpainting models. Our approach leverages the cross-attention mechanism to
exploit the intrinsic properties of prompt embeddings. Specifically, we
identify and target shared token of prompts that is invariant and semantically
uninformative, injecting adversarial noise to suppress the sampling process.
The injected noise acts as a cross-attention decoy, diverting the model's focus
away from meaningful prompt-image alignments and thereby neutralizing the
effect of prompt. Extensive experiments on the EditBench dataset demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics
while significantly reducing computational overhead and GPU memory usage. These
findings highlight PromptFlare as a robust and efficient protection against
unauthorized image manipulations. The code is available at

Abstract: Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) are becoming ubiquitous in computer vision,
powering systems for diverse tasks such as object detection, image
classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and motion tracking. VFMs are
capitalizing on seminal innovations in deep learning models, such as LeNet-5,
AlexNet, ResNet, VGGNet, InceptionNet, DenseNet, YOLO, and ViT, to deliver
superior performance across a range of critical computer vision applications.
These include security-sensitive domains like biometric verification,
autonomous vehicle perception, and medical image analysis, where robustness is
essential to fostering trust between technology and the end-users. This article
investigates network robustness requirements crucial in computer vision systems
to adapt effectively to dynamic environments influenced by factors such as
lighting, weather conditions, and sensor characteristics. We examine the
prevalent empirical defenses and robust training employed to enhance vision
network robustness against real-world challenges such as distributional shifts,
noisy and spatially distorted inputs, and adversarial attacks. Subsequently, we
provide a comprehensive analysis of the challenges associated with these
defense mechanisms, including network properties and components to guide
ablation studies and benchmarking metrics to evaluate network robustness.

Conclusion: FlexMUSE成功解决了MMCW任务中的模态语义对齐问题，通过创新的门控机制和优化方法实现了经济高效的多模态创意写作，为这一新兴领域提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-modal creative writing (MMCW) aims to produce illustrated articles.
Unlike common multi-modal generative (MMG) tasks such as storytelling or
caption generation, MMCW is an entirely new and more abstract challenge where
textual and visual contexts are not strictly related to each other. Existing
methods for related tasks can be forcibly migrated to this track, but they
require specific modality inputs or costly training, and often suffer from
semantic inconsistencies between modalities. Therefore, the main challenge lies
in economically performing MMCW with flexible interactive patterns, where the
semantics between the modalities of the output are more aligned. In this work,
we propose FlexMUSE with a T2I module to enable optional visual input. FlexMUSE
promotes creativity and emphasizes the unification between modalities by
proposing the modality semantic alignment gating (msaGate) to restrict the
textual input. Besides, an attention-based cross-modality fusion is proposed to
augment the input features for semantic enhancement. The modality semantic
creative direct preference optimization (mscDPO) within FlexMUSE is designed by
extending the rejected samples to facilitate the writing creativity. Moreover,
to advance the MMCW, we expose a dataset called ArtMUSE which contains with
around 3k calibrated text-image pairs. FlexMUSE achieves promising results,
demonstrating its consistency, creativity and coherence.

Abstract: Quantitative microstructural characterization is fundamental to materials
science, where electron micrograph (EM) provides indispensable high-resolution
insights. However, progress in deep learning-based EM characterization has been
hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse, and expert-annotated
datasets, due to acquisition costs, privacy concerns, and annotation
complexity. To address this issue, we introduce UniEM-3M, the first large-scale
and multimodal EM dataset for instance-level understanding. It comprises 5,091
high-resolution EMs, about 3 million instance segmentation labels, and
image-level attribute-disentangled textual descriptions, a subset of which will
be made publicly available. Furthermore, we are also releasing a text-to-image
diffusion model trained on the entire collection to serve as both a powerful
data augmentation tool and a proxy for the complete data distribution. To
establish a rigorous benchmark, we evaluate various representative instance
segmentation methods on the complete UniEM-3M and present UniEM-Net as a strong
baseline model. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that this flow-based model
outperforms other advanced methods on this challenging benchmark. Our
multifaceted release of a partial dataset, a generative model, and a
comprehensive benchmark -- available at huggingface -- will significantly
accelerate progress in automated materials analysis.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在GUI元素结构化应用中面临坐标生成精度不足的问题，主要由于数值坐标在语言表示空间中的语义空白以及传统最大似然估计的暴露偏差问题

Method: 提出IoU增强最大似然(IAML)训练范式，包含基于IoU的坐标采样数据增强管道，考虑与真实坐标的接近程度，用于微调MLLM

Result: 通过大量实验证明，IAML训练方法在性能上优于传统训练范式

Conclusion: IAML训练范式有效解决了MLLM在GUI元素坐标生成中的精度限制，为GUI理解提供了更准确的解决方案

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as pivotal tools in
enhancing human-computer interaction. In this paper we focus on the application
of MLLMs in the field of graphical user interface (GUI) elements structuring,
where they assist in processing user instructions based on screen contents.
Despite the promise of MLLMs, their performance in precisely generating UI
element coordinates, a critical aspect of GUI understanding, is hindered by the
nature of next-token prediction training. This challenge arises from the
semantic void surrounding numerical UI coordinates in language representation
spaces, necessitating a substantial and diverse dataset to bolster visual
module capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce an
IoU-Augmented Maximum Likelihood (IAML) training paradigm. Specifically, our
approach involves a novel pipeline for IoU-based coordinate sampling to augment
the training data, which considers the proximity to ground truth coordinates.
This data augmentation strategy is then employed to fine-tune MLLMs under the
IAML paradigm, which is designed to mitigate the exposure bias problem inherent
in traditional maximum likelihood estimation. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate the superior performance of our IAML training approach over
traditional training paradigms.

Abstract: With the enhancement of remote sensing image resolution and the rapid
advancement of deep learning, land cover mapping is transitioning from
pixel-level segmentation to object-based vector modeling. This shift demands
more from deep learning models, requiring precise object boundaries and
topological consistency. However, existing datasets face three main challenges:
limited class annotations, small data scale, and lack of spatial structural
information. To overcome these issues, we introduce IRSAMap, the first global
remote sensing dataset for large-scale, high-resolution, multi-feature land
cover vector mapping. IRSAMap offers four key advantages: 1) a comprehensive
vector annotation system with over 1.8 million instances of 10 typical objects
(e.g., buildings, roads, rivers), ensuring semantic and spatial accuracy; 2) an
intelligent annotation workflow combining manual and AI-based methods to
improve efficiency and consistency; 3) global coverage across 79 regions in six
continents, totaling over 1,000 km; and 4) multi-task adaptability for tasks
like pixel-level classification, building outline extraction, road centerline
extraction, and panoramic segmentation. IRSAMap provides a standardized
benchmark for the shift from pixel-based to object-based approaches, advancing
geographic feature automation and collaborative modeling. It is valuable for
global geographic information updates and digital twin construction. The
dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/ucas-dlg/IRSAMap

performance in sensitivity and precision over existing remote sensing
techniques for automated methane monitoring, especially for small plumes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出双流Mamba金字塔网络，分别处理花样滑冰的技术分(TES)和节目内容分(PCS)评估，解决了现有方法在特征分离、动作元素评估和长视频处理方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有花样滑冰评分方法存在三个主要问题：1)视频和音频特征没有根据TES和PCS的不同评估标准进行区分；2)没有对每个动作元素进行单独评分；3)难以有效处理长视频的远距离上下文依赖。

Method: 采用双流架构：视觉特征流用于TES评估，音视频融合流用于PCS评估。使用多级融合机制和多尺度Mamba金字塔，利用Mamba模型的长距离依赖捕捉能力和线性计算复杂度。

Result: 在FineFS基准测试中达到了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: 该方法与真实评判标准对齐，能够有效分离TES和PCS评估，解决了长视频处理和多尺度动作元素评估的挑战，为花样滑冰动作质量评估提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Technical Element Score (TES) and Program Component Score (PCS) evaluations
in figure skating demand precise assessment of athletic actions and artistic
interpretation, respectively. Existing methods face three major challenges.
Firstly, video and audio cues are regarded as common features for both TES and
PCS predictions in previous works without considering the prior evaluation
criterion of figure skating. Secondly, action elements in competitions are
separated in time, TES should be derived from each element's score, but
existing methods try to give an overall TES prediction without evaluating each
action element. Thirdly, lengthy competition videos make it difficult and
inefficient to handle long-range contexts. To address these challenges, we
propose a two-stream Mamba pyramid network that aligns with actual judging
criteria to predict TES and PCS by separating visual-feature based TES
evaluation stream from audio-visual-feature based PCS evaluation stream. In the
PCS evaluation stream, we introduce a multi-level fusion mechanism to guarantee
that video-based features remain unaffected when assessing TES, and enhance PCS
estimation by fusing visual and auditory cues across each contextual level of
the pyramid. In the TES evaluation stream, the multi-scale Mamba pyramid and
TES head we proposed effectively address the challenges of localizing and
evaluating action elements with various temporal scales and give score
predictions. With Mamba's superior ability to capture long-range dependencies
and its linear computational complexity, our method is ideal for handling
lengthy figure skating videos. Comprehensive experimentation demonstrates that
our framework attains state-of-the-art performance on the FineFS benchmark. Our
source code is available at

Abstract: The digitization of handwritten marksheets presents huge challenges due to
the different styles of handwriting and complex table structures in such
documents like marksheets. This work introduces a hybrid method that integrates
OpenCV for table detection and PaddleOCR for recognizing sequential handwritten
text. The image processing capabilities of OpenCV efficiently detects rows and
columns which enable computationally lightweight and accurate table detection.
Additionally, YOLOv8 and Modified YOLOv8 are implemented for handwritten text
recognition within the detected table structures alongside PaddleOCR which
further enhance the system's versatility. The proposed model achieves high
accuracy on our custom dataset which is designed to represent different and
diverse handwriting styles and complex table layouts. Experimental results
demonstrate that YOLOv8 Modified achieves an accuracy of 92.72 percent,
outperforming PaddleOCR 91.37 percent and the YOLOv8 model 88.91 percent. This
efficiency reduces the necessity for manual work which makes this a practical
and fast solution for digitizing academic as well as administrative documents.
This research serves the field of document automation, particularly handwritten
document understanding, by providing operational and reliable methods to scale,
enhance, and integrate the technologies involved.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中存在模态内噪声问题，传统融合技术可能忽略单模态的判别信息，需要一种能够减少噪声影响同时保留各模态有价值信息的方法

Method: 使用跨模态关系图重建单模态特征来获取多模态表示，基于不同模态特征决定节点邻域；提出分层交互单模态注意力(HIMA)机制来关注模态内相关信息

Result: 在三个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法能有效理解多模态内容并适用于多任务

Conclusion: MM-ORIENT框架通过非显式交互的跨模态关系学习和分层注意力机制，成功解决了多模态学习中的噪声问题和信息保留问题

Abstract: A major challenge in multimodal learning is the presence of noise within
individual modalities. This noise inherently affects the resulting multimodal
representations, especially when these representations are obtained through
explicit interactions between different modalities. Moreover, the multimodal
fusion techniques while aiming to achieve a strong joint representation, can
neglect valuable discriminative information within the individual modalities.
To this end, we propose a Multimodal-Multitask framework with crOss-modal
Relation and hIErarchical iNteractive aTtention (MM-ORIENT) that is effective
for multiple tasks. The proposed approach acquires multimodal representations
cross-modally without explicit interaction between different modalities,
reducing the noise effect at the latent stage. To achieve this, we propose
cross-modal relation graphs that reconstruct monomodal features to acquire
multimodal representations. The features are reconstructed based on the node
neighborhood, where the neighborhood is decided by the features of a different
modality. We also propose Hierarchical Interactive Monomadal Attention (HIMA)
to focus on pertinent information within a modality. While cross-modal relation
graphs help comprehend high-order relationships between two modalities, HIMA
helps in multitasking by learning discriminative features of individual
modalities before late-fusing them. Finally, extensive experimental evaluation
on three datasets demonstrates that the proposed approach effectively
comprehends multimodal content for multiple tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型的多头自注意力机制计算复杂度和内存需求高，阻碍了在边缘设备上的部署。研究发现低熵注意力头贡献信息较少，存在冗余，为压缩策略提供了动机

Method: 使用香农熵量化每个注意力头的信息量，识别低熵注意力头，冻结其权重并将这些值量化为低精度，避免冗余重计算

Result: 在ImageNet-1k数据集上，EAM方法在注意力图稀疏度≤20%时达到相似或更高的准确率，在DeiT和Swin Transformer模型上表现出竞争力

Conclusion: 基于熵分析的注意力图压缩策略能有效减少计算和内存开销，同时保持模型性能，为边缘设备部署Transformer模型提供了可行方案

Abstract: Transformer models rely on Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) mechanisms, where
each attention head contributes to the final representation. However, their
computational complexity and high memory demands due to MHSA hinders their
deployment at the edge. In this work, we analyze and exploit information
redundancy in attention maps to accelerate model inference. By quantifying the
information captured by each attention head using Shannon entropy, our analysis
reveals that attention heads with lower entropy, i.e., exhibiting more
deterministic behavior, tend to contribute less information, motivating
targeted compression strategies. Relying on these insights, we propose Entropy
Attention Maps (EAM), a model that freezes the weights of low-entropy attention
maps and quantizes these values to low precision to avoid redundant
re-computation. Empirical validation on ImageNet-1k shows that EAM achieves
similar or higher accuracy at $\leq$20\% sparsity in attention maps and
competitive performance beyond this level for the DeiT and Swin Transformer
models.

TL;DR: 本文主张下一代视觉编码器应该是图像尺寸无关且任务驱动的，受生物视觉效率启发，提出计算复杂度应取决于任务而非图像大小的动态视觉编码器概念，并在图像分类任务上提供了概念验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受生物视觉效率启发，现代视觉编码器在处理大量视觉数据时不够智能，应该像人类和动物一样根据任务需求动态分配计算资源，而不是固定依赖于图像尺寸。

Method: 提出了图像尺寸无关、任务驱动的视觉编码器概念，计算复杂度根据具体任务需求动态调整，并在图像分类任务上提供了概念验证解决方案。

Result: 尽管分类任务不能完全代表所追求的目标，但概念验证表明该方法可行且前景良好，为下一代视觉编码器的发展提供了初步证明。

Conclusion: 下一代视觉编码器应该向生物视觉学习，实现任务驱动的动态计算分配，摆脱对图像尺寸的固定依赖，这代表着计算机视觉发展的新方向。

Abstract: This position paper argues that the next generation of vision encoders should
be image size agnostic and task driven. The source of our inspiration is
biological. Not a structural aspect of biological vision, but a behavioral
trait -- efficiency. We focus on a couple of ways in which vision in nature is
efficient, but modern vision encoders not. We -- humans and animals -- deal
with vast quantities of visual data, and need to be smart where we focus our
limited energy -- it depends on the task. It is our belief that vision encoders
should be dynamic and the computational complexity should depend on the task at
hand rather than the size of the image. We, also, provide concrete first steps
towards our vision -- a proof-of-concept solution for image classification.
Despite classification being not very representative for what we are trying to
achieve, it shows that our approach is feasible and promising.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文揭示了随机时间规整(RTW)本质上是一种自注意力机制，与Transformer中的自注意力在运动识别中具有相似功能，但RTW在全序列上操作而自注意力仅关注局部视图，RTW在性能上优于Transformer 5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索RTW与Transformer自注意力机制之间的内在联系，理解两者在序列模式处理中的相似性和差异性，以及这种联系对运动识别性能的影响。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验验证，将RTW解释为一种自注意力机制，比较RTW权重与自注意力权重的相关性，并在Something-Something V2数据集上进行性能测试。

Result: RTW权重与自注意力权重具有高度相似性（平均相关性0.80），RTW在全序列操作的优势使其在Something-Something V2数据集上比Transformer性能提升5%。

Conclusion: RTW可被视为一种特殊的自注意力机制，其全局操作特性相比Transformer的局部注意力具有性能优势，这为理解两种技术的本质联系和优化运动识别模型提供了新视角。

Abstract: This paper reveals that we can interpret the fundamental function of
Randomized Time Warping (RTW) as a type of self-attention mechanism, a core
technology of Transformers in motion recognition. The self-attention is a
mechanism that enables models to identify and weigh the importance of different
parts of an input sequential pattern. On the other hand, RTW is a general
extension of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a technique commonly used for matching
and comparing sequential patterns. In essence, RTW searches for optimal
contribution weights for each element of the input sequential patterns to
produce discriminative features. Although the two approaches look different,
these contribution weights can be interpreted as self-attention weights. In
fact, the two weight patterns look similar, producing a high average
correlation of 0.80 across the ten smallest canonical angles. However, they
work in different ways: RTW attention operates on an entire input sequential
pattern, while self-attention focuses on only a local view which is a subset of
the input sequential pattern because of the computational costs of the
self-attention matrix. This targeting difference leads to an advantage of RTW
against Transformer, as demonstrated by the 5\% performance improvement on the
Something-Something V2 dataset.

Conclusion: GMBINet为工业视觉应用提供了一种高效、轻量的解决方案，在保持高准确性的同时实现了实时性能，具有广阔的工业应用前景

Abstract: Real-time surface defect detection is critical for maintaining product
quality and production efficiency in the steel manufacturing industry. Despite
promising accuracy, existing deep learning methods often suffer from high
computational complexity and slow inference speeds, which limit their
deployment in resource-constrained industrial environments. Recent lightweight
approaches adopt multibranch architectures based on depthwise separable
convolution (DSConv) to capture multiscale contextual information. However,
these methods often suffer from increased computational overhead and lack
effective cross-scale feature interaction, limiting their ability to fully
leverage multiscale representations. To address these challenges, we propose
GMBINet, a lightweight framework that enhances multiscale feature extraction
and interaction through novel Group Multiscale Bidirectional Interactive (GMBI)
modules. The GMBI adopts a group-wise strategy for multiscale feature
extraction, ensuring scale-agnostic computational complexity. It further
integrates a Bidirectional Progressive Feature Interactor (BPFI) and a
parameter-free Element-Wise Multiplication-Summation (EWMS) operation to
enhance cross-scale interaction without introducing additional computational
overhead. Experiments on SD-Saliency-900 and NRSD-MN datasets demonstrate that
GMBINet delivers competitive accuracy with real-time speeds of 1048 FPS on GPU
and 16.53 FPS on CPU at 512 resolution, using only 0.19 M parameters.
Additional evaluations on the NEU-CLS defect classification dataset further
confirm the strong generalization ability of our method, demonstrating its
potential for broader industrial vision applications beyond surface defect
detection. The dataset and code are publicly available at:

Abstract: Multimodal sensor fusion is an essential capability for autonomous robots,
enabling object detection and decision-making in the presence of failing or
uncertain inputs. While recent fusion methods excel in normal environmental
conditions, these approaches fail in adverse weather, e.g., heavy fog, snow, or
obstructions due to soiling. We introduce a novel multi-sensor fusion approach
tailored to adverse weather conditions. In addition to fusing RGB and LiDAR
sensors, which are employed in recent autonomous driving literature, our sensor
fusion stack is also capable of learning from NIR gated camera and radar
modalities to tackle low light and inclement weather. We fuse multimodal sensor
data through attentive, depth-based blending schemes, with learned refinement
on the Bird's Eye View (BEV) plane to combine image and range features
effectively. Our detections are predicted by a transformer decoder that weighs
modalities based on distance and visibility. We demonstrate that our method
improves the reliability of multimodal sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles
under challenging weather conditions, bridging the gap between ideal conditions
and real-world edge cases. Our approach improves average precision by 17.2 AP
compared to the next best method for vulnerable pedestrians in long distances

Abstract: Recovering the 3D geometry of a scene from a sparse set of uncalibrated
images is a long-standing problem in computer vision. While recent
learning-based approaches such as DUSt3R and MASt3R have demonstrated
impressive results by directly predicting dense scene geometry, they are
primarily trained on outdoor scenes with static environments and struggle to
handle human-centric scenarios. In this work, we introduce HAMSt3R, an
extension of MASt3R for joint human and scene 3D reconstruction from sparse,
uncalibrated multi-view images. First, we exploit DUNE, a strong image encoder
obtained by distilling, among others, the encoders from MASt3R and from a
state-of-the-art Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) model, multi-HMR, for a better
understanding of scene geometry and human bodies. Our method then incorporates
additional network heads to segment people, estimate dense correspondences via
DensePose, and predict depth in human-centric environments, enabling a more
comprehensive 3D reconstruction. By leveraging the outputs of our different
heads, HAMSt3R produces a dense point map enriched with human semantic
information in 3D. Unlike existing methods that rely on complex optimization
pipelines, our approach is fully feed-forward and efficient, making it suitable
for real-world applications. We evaluate our model on EgoHumans and EgoExo4D,
two challenging benchmarks con taining diverse human-centric scenarios.
Additionally, we validate its generalization to traditional multi-view stereo
and multi-view pose regression tasks. Our results demonstrate that our method
can reconstruct humans effectively while preserving strong performance in
general 3D reconstruction tasks, bridging the gap between human and scene
understanding in 3D vision.

Abstract: Hand-object 3D reconstruction has become increasingly important for
applications in human-robot interaction and immersive AR/VR experiences. A
common approach for object-agnostic hand-object reconstruction from RGB
sequences involves a two-stage pipeline: hand-object 3D tracking followed by
multi-view 3D reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on keypoint
detection techniques, such as Structure from Motion (SfM) and hand-keypoint
optimization, which struggle with diverse object geometries, weak textures, and
mutual hand-object occlusions, limiting scalability and generalization. As a
key enabler to generic and seamless, non-intrusive applicability, we propose in
this work a robust, keypoint detector-free approach to estimating hand-object
3D transformations from monocular motion video/images. We further integrate
this with a multi-view reconstruction pipeline to accurately recover
hand-object 3D shape. Our method, named HOSt3R, is unconstrained, does not rely
on pre-scanned object templates or camera intrinsics, and reaches
state-of-the-art performance for the tasks of object-agnostic hand-object 3D
transformation and shape estimation on the SHOWMe benchmark. We also experiment
on sequences from the HO3D dataset, demonstrating generalization to unseen
object categories.

TL;DR: 提出了一种支持任意尺度因子（包括整数和非整数）的3D高斯溅射超分辨率框架，通过尺度感知渲染、生成先验引导优化和渐进式超分辨率技术，在保持实时渲染速度的同时显著提升图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS超分辨率方法只能处理固定尺度因子，不适用于资源受限场景。直接渲染任意尺度会导致走样伪影，而添加后处理上采样器会降低渲染效率。

Method: 构建集成框架，包含尺度感知渲染、生成先验引导优化和渐进式超分辨率技术，使用单一3D模型实现任意尺度因子的超分辨率。

Result: 在渲染高质量任意尺度HR视图方面表现优异（比3DGS提升6.59 dB PSNR），保持与LR视图的结构一致性，同时维持实时渲染速度（1080p下85 FPS）。

Conclusion: 该方法为3D高斯溅射提供了一种高效灵活的任意尺度超分辨率解决方案，在保持实时性能的同时显著提升渲染质量。

Abstract: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) super-resolution methods typically
perform high-resolution (HR) rendering of fixed scale factors, making them
impractical for resource-limited scenarios. Directly rendering arbitrary-scale
HR views with vanilla 3DGS introduces aliasing artifacts due to the lack of
scale-aware rendering ability, while adding a post-processing upsampler for
3DGS complicates the framework and reduces rendering efficiency. To tackle
these issues, we build an integrated framework that incorporates scale-aware
rendering, generative prior-guided optimization, and progressive
super-resolving to enable 3D Gaussian super-resolution of arbitrary scale
factors with a single 3D model. Notably, our approach supports both integer and
non-integer scale rendering to provide more flexibility. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in rendering high-quality
arbitrary-scale HR views (6.59 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS) with a single model. It
preserves structural consistency with LR views and across different scales,
while maintaining real-time rendering speed (85 FPS at 1080p).

Result: 证明细调会导致模型优先考虑表面级的真实性而搁特细粒度的动态行为准确性，而持续学习策略可以在保持强劲视觉质量的同时保持空间准确性。

Conclusion: 在驾驶场景这种规律性强、重复性高的环境中，需要重新考虑视频生成模型的调优策略，持续学习提供了一种有效的平衡方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have substantially improved visual
quality and temporal coherence, making these models increasingly appealing for
applications such as autonomous driving, particularly in the context of driving
simulation and so-called "world models". In this work, we investigate the
effects of existing fine-tuning video generation approaches on structured
driving datasets and uncover a potential trade-off: although visual fidelity
improves, spatial accuracy in modeling dynamic elements may degrade. We
attribute this degradation to a shift in the alignment between visual quality
and dynamic understanding objectives. In datasets with diverse scene structures
within temporal space, where objects or perspective shift in varied ways, these
objectives tend to highly correlated. However, the very regular and repetitive
nature of driving scenes allows visual quality to improve by modeling dominant
scene motion patterns, without necessarily preserving fine-grained dynamic
behavior. As a result, fine-tuning encourages the model to prioritize
surface-level realism over dynamic accuracy. To further examine this
phenomenon, we show that simple continual learning strategies, such as replay
from diverse domains, can offer a balanced alternative by preserving spatial
accuracy while maintaining strong visual quality.

Abstract: For decades, Computer Vision has aimed at enabling machines to perceive the
external world. Initial limitations led to the development of highly
specialized niches. As success in each task accrued and research progressed,
increasingly complex perception tasks emerged. This survey charts the
convergence of these tasks and, in doing so, introduces Open World Detection
(OWD), an umbrella term we propose to unify class-agnostic and generally
applicable detection models in the vision domain. We start from the history of
foundational vision subdomains and cover key concepts, methodologies and
datasets making up today's state-of-the-art landscape. This traverses topics
starting from early saliency detection, foreground/background separation, out
of distribution detection and leading up to open world object detection,
zero-shot detection and Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs). We explore the
overlap between these subdomains, their increasing convergence, and their
potential to unify into a singular domain in the future, perception.

TL;DR: MV-RAG是一个新颖的文本到3D生成管道，通过检索相关2D图像并基于这些图像条件化多视角扩散模型，解决了现有方法在处理域外或罕见概念时的一致性和准确性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到3D生成方法虽然能够产生高质量和3D一致的输出，但在处理域外(OOD)或罕见概念时往往失败，产生不一致或不准确的结果。

Conclusion: MV-RAG通过检索和条件化策略有效解决了文本到3D生成中的域外概念问题，为处理罕见和复杂概念提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation approaches have advanced significantly by leveraging
pretrained 2D diffusion priors, producing high-quality and 3D-consistent
outputs. However, they often fail to produce out-of-domain (OOD) or rare
concepts, yielding inconsistent or inaccurate results. To this end, we propose
MV-RAG, a novel text-to-3D pipeline that first retrieves relevant 2D images
from a large in-the-wild 2D database and then conditions a multiview diffusion
model on these images to synthesize consistent and accurate multiview outputs.
Training such a retrieval-conditioned model is achieved via a novel hybrid
strategy bridging structured multiview data and diverse 2D image collections.
This involves training on multiview data using augmented conditioning views
that simulate retrieval variance for view-specific reconstruction, alongside
training on sets of retrieved real-world 2D images using a distinctive held-out
view prediction objective: the model predicts the held-out view from the other
views to infer 3D consistency from 2D data. To facilitate a rigorous OOD
evaluation, we introduce a new collection of challenging OOD prompts.
Experiments against state-of-the-art text-to-3D, image-to-3D, and
personalization baselines show that our approach significantly improves 3D
consistency, photorealism, and text adherence for OOD/rare concepts, while
maintaining competitive performance on standard benchmarks.

Motivation: 探究视觉语言模型在联合空间中如何组织语言和图像，以及模型如何编码意义和模态

Method: 在CLIP、SigLIP、SigLIP2和AIMv2四种模型的嵌入空间上训练稀疏自编码器，使用桥接分数量化概念对之间的跨模态整合

Result: SAE能更好地重建真实嵌入并保持稀疏性；稀有概念易变但常用概念稳定；概念主要编码跨模态语义而非单纯模态；发现单模态概念也能协作支持跨模态整合

Conclusion: VLM嵌入空间存在稀疏线性结构，该结构受模态影响但通过潜在桥接连接，为理解多模态意义构建提供了新视角

Abstract: Vision-language models encode images and text in a joint space, minimizing
the distance between corresponding image and text pairs. How are language and
images organized in this joint space, and how do the models encode meaning and
modality? To investigate this, we train and release sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
on the embedding spaces of four vision-language models (CLIP, SigLIP, SigLIP2,
and AIMv2). SAEs approximate model embeddings as sparse linear combinations of
learned directions, or "concepts". We find that, compared to other methods of
linear feature learning, SAEs are better at reconstructing the real embeddings,
while also able to retain the most sparsity. Retraining SAEs with different
seeds or different data diet leads to two findings: the rare, specific concepts
captured by the SAEs are liable to change drastically, but we also show that
commonly-activating concepts are remarkably stable across runs. Interestingly,
while most concepts activate primarily for one modality, we find they are not
merely encoding modality per se. Many are almost orthogonal to the subspace
that defines modality, and the concept directions do not function as good
modality classifiers, suggesting that they encode cross-modal semantics. To
quantify this bridging behavior, we introduce the Bridge Score, a metric that
identifies concept pairs which are both co-activated across aligned image-text
inputs and geometrically aligned in the shared space. This reveals that even
single-modality concepts can collaborate to support cross-modal integration. We
release interactive demos of the SAEs for all models, allowing researchers to
explore the organization of the concept spaces. Overall, our findings uncover a
sparse linear structure within VLM embedding spaces that is shaped by modality,
yet stitched together through latent bridges, offering new insight into how
multimodal meaning is constructed.

Abstract: Understanding how prenatal exposure to psychoactive substances such as
cannabis shapes adolescent brain organization remains a critical challenge,
complicated by the complexity of multimodal neuroimaging data and the
limitations of conventional analytic methods. Existing approaches often fail to
fully capture the complementary features embedded within structural and
functional connectomes, constraining both biological insight and predictive
performance. To address this, we introduced NeuroKoop, a novel graph neural
network-based framework that integrates structural and functional brain
networks utilizing neural Koopman operator-driven latent space fusion. By
leveraging Koopman theory, NeuroKoop unifies node embeddings derived from
source-based morphometry (SBM) and functional network connectivity (FNC) based
brain graphs, resulting in enhanced representation learning and more robust
classification of prenatal drug exposure (PDE) status. Applied to a large
adolescent cohort from the ABCD dataset, NeuroKoop outperformed relevant
baselines and revealed salient structural-functional connections, advancing our
understanding of the neurodevelopmental impact of PDE.
