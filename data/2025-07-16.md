### [1] [Truth Sleuth and Trend Bender: AI Agents to fact-check YouTube videos and influence opinions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10577)
*Logé Cécile,Ghori Rehan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种AI系统，通过Truth Sleuth和Trend Bender两个代理，分别进行视频内容的事实核查和在评论区引导讨论，以对抗YouTube上的错误信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 错误信息在数字世界中快速传播，威胁社会，需要有效工具进行干预。

Method: 系统采用RAG方法提取视频中的主张并验证其真实性，同时生成有说服力的评论以引导讨论。

Result: 实验表明系统在事实核查和用户互动方面表现优异，能有效对抗错误信息。

Conclusion: AI驱动的干预措施在对抗错误信息和促进在线空间的信息真实性方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Misinformation poses a significant threat in today's digital world, often
spreading rapidly through platforms like YouTube. This paper introduces a novel
approach to combating misinformation by developing an AI-powered system that
not only fact-checks claims made in YouTube videos but also actively engages
users in the comment section and challenge misleading narratives. Our system
comprises two main agents: Truth Sleuth and Trend Bender.
  Truth Sleuth extracts claims from a YouTube video, uses a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) approach - drawing on sources like Wikipedia, Google Search,
Google FactCheck - to accurately assess their veracity and generates a nuanced
and comprehensive report. Through rigorous prompt engineering, Trend Bender
leverages this report along with a curated corpus of relevant articles to
generate insightful and persuasive comments designed to stimulate a productive
debate. With a carefully set up self-evaluation loop, this agent is able to
iteratively improve its style and refine its output.
  We demonstrate the system's capabilities through experiments on established
benchmark datasets and a real-world deployment on YouTube, showcasing its
potential to engage users and potentially influence perspectives. Our findings
highlight the high accuracy of our fact-checking agent, and confirm the
potential of AI-driven interventions in combating misinformation and fostering
a more informed online space.

### [2] [An Offline Mobile Conversational Agent for Mental Health Support: Learning from Emotional Dialogues and Psychological Texts with Student-Centered Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10580)
*Vimaleswar A,Prabhu Nandan Sahu,Nilesh Kumar Sahu,Haroon R Lone*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EmoSApp是一款基于智能手机的离线情感支持应用，利用量化的大型语言模型（LLM）在设备上运行，解决了数字心理健康平台的可访问性、隐私和连接性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字心理健康平台存在用户可访问性、互联网连接和数据隐私问题，需要一种离线解决方案。

Method: 开发EmoSApp，使用Torchtune和Executorch对LLaMA-3.2-1B-Instruct模型进行微调和量化，部署到资源受限设备上，并基于14,582个心理健康问答对和多轮对话数据进行训练。

Result: 定性评估显示EmoSApp能连贯、同理地回应用户，并提供相关建议；定量评估表明模型在低资源环境下表现良好。

Conclusion: EmoSApp为便携、安全和定制化的AI心理健康解决方案提供了范例。

Abstract: Mental health plays a crucial role in the overall well-being of an
individual. In recent years, digital platforms have been increasingly used to
expand mental health and emotional support. However, there are persistent
challenges related to limited user accessibility, internet connectivity, and
data privacy, which highlight the need for an offline, smartphone-based
solution. To address these challenges, we propose EmoSApp (Emotional Support
App): an entirely offline, smartphone-based conversational app designed for
mental health and emotional support. The system leverages Large Language Models
(LLMs), specifically fine-tuned, quantized and deployed using Torchtune and
Executorch for resource-constrained devices, allowing all inferences to occur
on the smartphone. To equip EmoSApp with robust domain expertise, we fine-tuned
the LLaMA-3.2-1B-Instruct model on our custom curated ``Knowledge dataset'' of
14,582 mental-health QA pairs, along with the multi-turn conversational data.
  Through qualitative human evaluation with the student population, we
demonstrate that EmoSApp has the ability to respond coherently, empathetically,
maintain interactive dialogue, and provide relevant suggestions to user's
mental health problems. Additionally, quantitative evaluations on nine standard
commonsense and reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our
fine-tuned, quantized model in low-resource settings. By prioritizing on-device
deployment and specialized domain adaptation, EmoSApp serves as a blueprint for
future innovations in portable, secure, and highly tailored AI-driven mental
health solutions.

### [3] [Transforming Sensitive Documents into Quantitative Data: An AI-Based Preprocessing Toolchain for Structured and Privacy-Conscious Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10582)
*Anders Ledberg,Anna Thalén*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种模块化工具链，用于处理法律、医疗和行政文本数据，解决隐私和异构性问题，支持嵌入分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律、医疗和行政文本数据具有丰富的研究价值，但隐私和异构性限制了其大规模分析。

Method: 使用开源模型在本地硬件上处理文本，包括标准化、总结、翻译和匿名化。

Result: 工具链在瑞典法院决策数据集上验证有效，能去除敏感信息并保留语义内容。

Conclusion: 该工具链为隐私敏感领域的大规模文本分析提供了新可能。

Abstract: Unstructured text from legal, medical, and administrative sources offers a
rich but underutilized resource for research in public health and the social
sciences. However, large-scale analysis is hampered by two key challenges: the
presence of sensitive, personally identifiable information, and significant
heterogeneity in structure and language. We present a modular toolchain that
prepares such text data for embedding-based analysis, relying entirely on
open-weight models that run on local hardware, requiring only a
workstation-level GPU and supporting privacy-sensitive research.
  The toolchain employs large language model (LLM) prompting to standardize,
summarize, and, when needed, translate texts to English for greater
comparability. Anonymization is achieved via LLM-based redaction, supplemented
with named entity recognition and rule-based methods to minimize the risk of
disclosure. We demonstrate the toolchain on a corpus of 10,842 Swedish court
decisions under the Care of Abusers Act (LVM), comprising over 56,000 pages.
Each document is processed into an anonymized, standardized summary and
transformed into a document-level embedding. Validation, including manual
review, automated scanning, and predictive evaluation shows the toolchain
effectively removes identifying information while retaining semantic content.
As an illustrative application, we train a predictive model using embedding
vectors derived from a small set of manually labeled summaries, demonstrating
the toolchain's capacity for semi-automated content analysis at scale.
  By enabling structured, privacy-conscious analysis of sensitive documents,
our toolchain opens new possibilities for large-scale research in domains where
textual data was previously inaccessible due to privacy and heterogeneity
constraints.

### [4] [A Taxonomy for Design and Evaluation of Prompt-Based Natural Language Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10585)
*Isar Nejadgholi,Mona Omidyeganeh,Marc-Antoine Drouin,Jonathan Boisvert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种更新的XAI分类法，专注于自然语言解释（NLEs），以支持透明AI系统的治理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的兴起，NLEs成为解释模型行为的关键，需要对其特性和治理影响进行系统研究。

Method: 基于可解释AI（XAI）文献，构建了一个针对NLEs的三维分类法，涵盖上下文、生成与呈现、评估。

Result: 分类法为研究人员、审计者和政策制定者提供了设计和改进NLEs的框架。

Conclusion: 该分类法有助于提升AI系统的透明度和治理效果。

Abstract: Effective AI governance requires structured approaches for stakeholders to
access and verify AI system behavior. With the rise of large language models,
Natural Language Explanations (NLEs) are now key to articulating model
behavior, which necessitates a focused examination of their characteristics and
governance implications. We draw on Explainable AI (XAI) literature to create
an updated XAI taxonomy, adapted to prompt-based NLEs, across three dimensions:
(1) Context, including task, data, audience, and goals; (2) Generation and
Presentation, covering generation methods, inputs, interactivity, outputs, and
forms; and (3) Evaluation, focusing on content, presentation, and user-centered
properties, as well as the setting of the evaluation. This taxonomy provides a
framework for researchers, auditors, and policymakers to characterize, design,
and enhance NLEs for transparent AI systems.

### [5] [AutoRAG-LoRA: Hallucination-Triggered Knowledge Retuning via Lightweight Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10586)
*Kaushik Dwivedi,Padmanabh Patanjali Mishra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoRAG-LoRA是一个模块化框架，通过轻量级LoRA适配器和KL正则化训练减少大语言模型的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在自然语言任务中表现出色，但存在幻觉问题，影响实际部署的信任度。

Method: 结合自动提示重写、混合检索和低秩适配器调优，通过检测模块和反馈修正循环减少幻觉。

Result: AutoRAG-LoRA显著减少了事实漂移，同时保持了模型的效率和模块化。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了大语言模型的幻觉问题，提升了生成内容的可信度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable fluency across a
range of natural language tasks, yet remain vulnerable to hallucinations -
factual inaccuracies that undermine trust in real world deployment. We present
AutoRAG-LoRA, a modular framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that
tackles hallucination in large language models through lightweight LoRA-based
adapters and KL-regularized training. Our pipeline integrates automated prompt
rewriting, hybrid retrieval, and low-rank adapter tuning to ground responses in
retrieved evidence. A hallucination detection module, using both
classifier-based and self-evaluation techniques, assigns confidence scores to
generated outputs, triggering an optional feedback correction loop. This loop
enforces factual alignment via contrastive KL loss and adapter fine tuning. We
demonstrate that AutoRAG-LoRA significantly reduces the factual drift while
preserving the efficiency and modularity of the model.

### [6] [Anthropomimetic Uncertainty: What Verbalized Uncertainty in Language Models is Missing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10587)
*Dennis Ulmer,Alexandra Lorson,Ivan Titov,Christian Hardmeier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了LLMs输出过于自信的问题，提出通过语言化不确定性信号提升信任度，并呼吁研究更贴近人类表达方式的不确定性沟通。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs输出过于自信导致信任缺失的问题，提升人机协作效果。

Method: 综述人类不确定性沟通研究，分析现有数据偏见，提出拟人化不确定性概念。

Result: 揭示了语言化不确定性中的偏见，并分解了拟人化不确定性的研究方向。

Conclusion: 未来NLP研究需关注拟人化不确定性，以提升LLMs的信任度和沟通效果。

Abstract: Human users increasingly rely on natural language interactions with large
language models (LLMs) in order to receive help on a large variety of tasks and
problems. However, the trustworthiness and perceived legitimacy of LLMs is
undermined by the fact that their output is frequently stated in very confident
terms, even when its accuracy is questionable. Therefore, there is a need to
signal the confidence of the language model to a user in order to reap the
benefits of human-machine collaboration and mitigate potential harms.
Verbalized uncertainty is the expression of confidence with linguistic means,
an approach that integrates perfectly into language-based interfaces.
Nevertheless, most recent research in natural language processing (NLP)
overlooks the nuances surrounding human uncertainty communication and the data
biases that influence machine uncertainty communication. We argue for
anthropomimetic uncertainty, meaning that intuitive and trustworthy uncertainty
communication requires a degree of linguistic authenticity and personalization
to the user, which could be achieved by emulating human communication. We
present a thorough overview over the research in human uncertainty
communication, survey ongoing research, and perform additional analyses to
demonstrate so-far overlooked biases in verbalized uncertainty. We conclude by
pointing out unique factors in human-machine communication of uncertainty and
deconstruct anthropomimetic uncertainty into future research directions for
NLP.

### [7] [PLEX: Perturbation-free Local Explanations for LLM-Based Text Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10596)
*Yogachandran Rahulamathavan,Misbah Farooq,Varuna De Silva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PLEX是一种无需扰动的局部解释方法，利用LLM的上下文嵌入和Siamese网络，显著提高了解释效率，与LIME和SHAP效果相当但计算成本更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在文本分类中表现优异，但其复杂性导致解释性差，现有XAI方法（如LIME和SHAP）计算成本高。

Method: 提出PLEX方法，利用LLM的上下文嵌入和Siamese网络，无需扰动即可生成解释。

Result: 在四个分类任务中，PLEX与LIME和SHAP的一致性超过92%，且计算效率提升显著。

Conclusion: PLEX为LLM的文本分类提供了一种高效的解释方法，显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in text classification, but their
complexity hinders interpretability, making it difficult to understand the
reasoning behind their predictions. Explainable AI (XAI) methods like LIME and
SHAP offer local explanations by identifying influential words, but they rely
on computationally expensive perturbations. These methods typically generate
thousands of perturbed sentences and perform inferences on each, incurring a
substantial computational burden, especially with LLMs. To address this, we
propose \underline{P}erturbation-free \underline{L}ocal \underline{Ex}planation
(PLEX), a novel method that leverages the contextual embeddings extracted from
the LLM and a ``Siamese network" style neural network trained to align with
feature importance scores. This one-off training eliminates the need for
subsequent perturbations, enabling efficient explanations for any new sentence.
We demonstrate PLEX's effectiveness on four different classification tasks
(sentiment, fake news, fake COVID-19 news and depression), showing more than
92\% agreement with LIME and SHAP. Our evaluation using a ``stress test"
reveals that PLEX accurately identifies influential words, leading to a similar
decline in classification accuracy as observed with LIME and SHAP when these
words are removed. Notably, in some cases, PLEX demonstrates superior
performance in capturing the impact of key features. PLEX dramatically
accelerates explanation, reducing time and computational overhead by two and
four orders of magnitude, respectively. This work offers a promising solution
for explainable LLM-based text classification.

### [8] [Emergence of Hierarchical Emotion Organization in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10599)
*Bo Zhao,Maya Okawa,Eric J. Bigelow,Rose Yu,Tomer Ullman,Ekdeep Singh Lubana,Hidenori Tanaka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs自然形成与人类心理模型一致的情感层次结构，但存在社会经济角色偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs如何建模用户情感状态，以促进伦理部署。

Method: 基于情感轮理论，分析模型输出的情感状态概率依赖关系。

Result: LLMs形成层次化情感树，且模型越大结构越复杂；发现社会经济角色偏见。

Conclusion: LLMs内化了社会感知，认知理论可用于改进模型评估。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly power conversational agents,
understanding how they model users' emotional states is critical for ethical
deployment. Inspired by emotion wheels -- a psychological framework that argues
emotions organize hierarchically -- we analyze probabilistic dependencies
between emotional states in model outputs. We find that LLMs naturally form
hierarchical emotion trees that align with human psychological models, and
larger models develop more complex hierarchies. We also uncover systematic
biases in emotion recognition across socioeconomic personas, with compounding
misclassifications for intersectional, underrepresented groups. Human studies
reveal striking parallels, suggesting that LLMs internalize aspects of social
perception. Beyond highlighting emergent emotional reasoning in LLMs, our
results hint at the potential of using cognitively-grounded theories for
developing better model evaluations.

### [9] [Language Models for Adult Service Website Text Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10743)
*Nickolas Freeman,Thanh Nguyen,Gregory Bott,Jason Parton,Collin Francel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了成人服务网站（ASW）广告文本的语言建模方法，以识别性交易受害者。通过定制化Transformer模型，在有限GPU资源下高效训练，并在多个任务中表现优于BERT等知名模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 成人服务网站（ASW）广告文本因使用表情符号、语法混乱和故意模糊而难以分析，但却是识别性交易受害者的关键数据。

Method: 研究比较了信息检索方法、预训练Transformer和定制化Transformer模型，提出了一种高效的小规模GPU训练方法。

Result: 定制化模型在准确性、召回率、F1分数和ROC AUC上优于BERT-base、RoBERTa和ModernBERT。

Conclusion: 定制化Transformer模型在ASW文本分析中表现优异，为下游应用和研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Sex trafficking refers to the use of force, fraud, or coercion to compel an
individual to perform in commercial sex acts against their will. Adult service
websites (ASWs) have and continue to be linked to sex trafficking, offering a
platform for traffickers to advertise their victims. Thus, organizations
involved in the fight against sex trafficking often use ASW data when
attempting to identify potential sex trafficking victims. A critical challenge
in transforming ASW data into actionable insight is text analysis. Previous
research using ASW data has shown that ASW ad text is important for linking
ads. However, working with this text is challenging due to its extensive use of
emojis, poor grammar, and deliberate obfuscation to evade law enforcement
scrutiny. We conduct a comprehensive study of language modeling approaches for
this application area, including simple information retrieval methods,
pre-trained transformers, and custom transformer models. We demonstrate that
characteristics of ASW text data allow efficient custom transformer models to
be trained with relatively small GPU resources and used efficiently for
inference on consumer hardware. Our custom models outperform fine-tuned
variants of well-known encoder-only transformer models, including BERT-base,
RoBERTa, and ModernBERT, on accuracy, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC. We
demonstrate the use of our best-performing custom configuration on three tasks
related to ASW data analysis: (i) decomposing the giant component in a graph
representation of ASW data, (ii) clustering ASW ad text, and (iii) using the
learned token embeddings to understand the use of emojis in the illicit context
we study. The models we develop represent a significant advancement in ASW text
analysis, which can be leveraged in a variety of downstream applications and
research.

TL;DR: 利用预训练文本嵌入模型增强属性图的语义分析，提升节点分类和关系预测任务的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标记属性图中丰富的文本属性可以增强分析任务，但需要有效利用这些文本信息。

Method: 通过嵌入文本节点和边属性，将语言模型嵌入集成到图分析流程中，不改变图结构。

Result: 文本语义显著提升了属性图分析的准确性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 预训练文本嵌入模型能有效增强属性图的语义分析能力。

Abstract: Labeled property graphs often contain rich textual attributes that can
enhance analytical tasks when properly leveraged. This work explores the use of
pretrained text embedding models to enable efficient semantic analysis in such
graphs. By embedding textual node and edge properties, we support downstream
tasks including node classification and relation prediction with improved
contextual understanding. Our approach integrates language model embeddings
into the graph pipeline without altering its structure, demonstrating that
textual semantics can significantly enhance the accuracy and interpretability
of property graph analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学文献中的示意图解读对信息提取至关重要，但现有模型在此任务上的能力尚未被系统评估。

Method: 构建MISS-QA基准，包含465篇论文的1500个标注示例，测试模型基于示意图回答问题的能力。

Result: 18种前沿模型表现显著低于人类专家，尤其在无法回答问题及错误分析中暴露局限性。

Conclusion: MISS-QA揭示了当前模型在多模态科学文献理解上的不足，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: This paper introduces MISS-QA, the first benchmark specifically designed to
evaluate the ability of models to interpret schematic diagrams within
scientific literature. MISS-QA comprises 1,500 expert-annotated examples over
465 scientific papers. In this benchmark, models are tasked with interpreting

### [12] [Testing Hypotheses from the Social Approval Theory of Online Hate: An Analysis of 110 Million Posts from Parler](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10810)
*David M. Markowitz,Samuel Hardman Taylor*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，社交平台上的仇恨言论并不总是因获得社会认可而增加或极端化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在线仇恨言论是否因社会认可而加剧或极端化，验证Walter的社会认可理论。

Method: 分析Parler平台上1.1亿条帖子（2018-2021年），研究点赞数与后续仇恨言论的关系。

Result: 点赞数与后续仇恨言论无显著关联，甚至在某些时间区间呈现负相关。

Conclusion: 社交认可对仇恨言论的强化机制在特定平台上可能表现不同。

Abstract: In this paper, we explored how online hate is motivated by receiving social
approval from others. We specifically examined two central tenets of Walther's
(2024) social approval theory of online hate: (H1a) more signals of social
approval on hate messages predicts more subsequent hate messages, and (H1b) as
social approval increases, hate speech messages become more extreme. Using over
110 million posts from Parler (2018-2021), we observed that the number of
upvotes a person received on a hate speech post was unassociated with the
amount of hate speech in their next post and posts during the next week, month,
three months, and six months. Between-person effects revealed an average
negative relationship between social approval and hate speech production at the
post level, but this relationship was mixed at other time intervals. Social
approval reinforcement mechanisms of online hate may operate differently on
niche social media platforms.

### [13] [LLMs on Trial: Evaluating Judicial Fairness for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10852)
*Yiran Hu,Zongyue Xue,Haitao Li,Siyuan Zheng,Qingjing Chen,Shaochun Wang,Xihan Zhang,Ning Zheng,Yun Liu,Qingyao Ai,Yiqun Liu,Charles L. A. Clarke,Weixing Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在司法系统中的公平性问题，提出了一个评估框架并发现LLMs普遍存在不一致性、偏见和不平衡的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在司法决策中的公平性，以确保其可信度和社会正义影响。

Method: 构建了一个包含65个标签和161个值的公平性评估框架，并开发了三个评估指标（不一致性、偏见、不平衡准确性），应用于177,100个案例数据集（JudiFair）。

Result: 实验发现16个LLMs普遍存在不公平现象，尤其在人口统计标签上偏见更明显。调整温度参数可影响公平性，但模型规模、发布时间和来源国无显著影响。

Conclusion: LLMs在司法系统中存在严重公平性问题，需进一步研究和改进。论文提供了公开工具包以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes fields
where their decisions impact rights and equity. However, LLMs' judicial
fairness and implications for social justice remain underexplored. When LLMs
act as judges, the ability to fairly resolve judicial issues is a prerequisite
to ensure their trustworthiness. Based on theories of judicial fairness, we
construct a comprehensive framework to measure LLM fairness, leading to a
selection of 65 labels and 161 corresponding values. Applying this framework to
the judicial system, we compile an extensive dataset, JudiFair, comprising
177,100 unique case facts. To achieve robust statistical inference, we develop
three evaluation metrics, inconsistency, bias, and imbalanced inaccuracy, and
introduce a method to assess the overall fairness of multiple LLMs across
various labels. Through experiments with 16 LLMs, we uncover pervasive
inconsistency, bias, and imbalanced inaccuracy across models, underscoring
severe LLM judicial unfairness. Particularly, LLMs display notably more
pronounced biases on demographic labels, with slightly less bias on substance
labels compared to procedure ones. Interestingly, increased inconsistency
correlates with reduced biases, but more accurate predictions exacerbate
biases. While we find that adjusting the temperature parameter can influence
LLM fairness, model size, release date, and country of origin do not exhibit
significant effects on judicial fairness. Accordingly, we introduce a publicly
available toolkit containing all datasets and code, designed to support future
research in evaluating and improving LLM fairness.

*Ikumi Numaya,Shoji Moriya,Shiki Sato,Reina Akama,Jun Suzuki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了对话生成中主观与客观风格相似性对用户偏好的影响，发现主观相似性与用户偏好强相关，且与客观评价存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是区分主观与客观风格相似性，以更好地理解其对用户偏好的影响。

Method: 通过构建包含用户偏好、主观和客观风格相似性的新数据集进行分析。

Result: 分析显示主观风格相似性与用户偏好强相关，且与客观评价不同。

Conclusion: 结论强调区分主观与客观评价的重要性，以更准确地分析风格相似性与用户偏好的关系。

Abstract: Recent advancements in dialogue generation have broadened the scope of
human-bot interactions, enabling not only contextually appropriate responses
but also the analysis of human affect and sensitivity. While prior work has
suggested that stylistic similarity between user and system may enhance user
impressions, the distinction between subjective and objective similarity is
often overlooked. To investigate this issue, we introduce a novel dataset that
includes users' preferences, subjective stylistic similarity based on users'
own perceptions, and objective stylistic similarity annotated by third party
evaluators in open-domain dialogue settings. Analysis using the constructed
dataset reveals a strong positive correlation between subjective stylistic
similarity and user preference. Furthermore, our analysis suggests an important
finding: users' subjective stylistic similarity differs from third party
objective similarity. This underscores the importance of distinguishing between
subjective and objective evaluations and understanding the distinct aspects
each captures when analyzing the relationship between stylistic similarity and
user preferences. The dataset presented in this paper is available online.

### [15] [HanjaBridge: Resolving Semantic Ambiguity in Korean LLMs via Hanja-Augmented Pre-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10920)
*Seungho Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HanjaBridge通过注入多义性汉字的候选信息，结合持续预训练框架，显著提升了韩语低资源语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决韩语中同音异义汉字词在韩文脚本中的语义模糊问题，提升低资源语言模型的性能。

Method: 提出HanjaBridge技术，为同形词提供所有可能的汉字候选，结合持续预训练和知识蒸馏。

Result: 在KoBALT基准上相对提升21%，并观察到跨语言迁移的积极效果。

Conclusion: HanjaBridge不仅提升了韩语理解能力，还通过汉字共享实现了跨语言迁移，且无需额外推理成本。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often show poor performance in low-resource
languages like Korean, partly due to unique linguistic challenges such as
homophonous Sino-Korean words that are indistinguishable in Hangul script. To
address this semantic ambiguity, we propose HanjaBridge, a novel
meaning-injection technique integrated into a continual pre-training (CPT)
framework. Instead of deterministically mapping a word to a single Hanja
(Chinese character), HanjaBridge presents the model with all possible Hanja
candidates for a given homograph, encouraging the model to learn contextual
disambiguation. This process is paired with token-level knowledge distillation
to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results show that HanjaBridge
significantly improves Korean language understanding, achieving a 21\% relative
improvement on the KoBALT benchmark. Notably, by reinforcing semantic alignment
between Korean and Chinese through shared Hanja, we observe a strong positive
cross-lingual transfer. Furthermore, these gains persist even when Hanja
augmentation is omitted at inference time, ensuring practical efficiency with
no additional run-time cost.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought them closer
to matching human cognition across a variety of tasks. How well do these models
align with human performance in detecting and mapping analogies? Prior research
has shown that LLMs can extract similarities from analogy problems but lack
robust human-like reasoning. Building on Webb, Holyoak, and Lu (2023), the
current study focused on a story-based analogical mapping task and conducted a
fine-grained evaluation of LLM reasoning abilities compared to human
performance. First, it explored the semantic representation of analogies in
LLMs, using sentence embeddings to assess whether they capture the similarity
between the source and target texts of an analogy, and the dissimilarity
between the source and distractor texts. Second, it investigated the
effectiveness of explicitly prompting LLMs to explain analogies. Throughout, we
examine whether LLMs exhibit similar performance profiles to those observed in
humans by evaluating their reasoning at the level of individual analogies, and
not just at the level of overall accuracy (as prior studies have done). Our
experiments include evaluating the impact of model size (8B vs. 70B parameters)
and performance variation across state-of-the-art model architectures such as
GPT-4 and LLaMA3. This work advances our understanding of the analogical
reasoning abilities of LLMs and their potential as models of human reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在AI任务中表现优异，但由于手语的复杂性和独特规则，其对手语生成的影响有限。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过微调LLM，采用逐步提示策略，提取LLM中的手语知识，支持学习和生成过程。

Result: 在How2Sign和Phoenix14T数据集上的实验表明，该方法有效利用了LLM的手语知识和推理能力，对齐了手语与口语的分布和语法规则。

Conclusion: TEAM-Sign成功将LLM应用于手语生成，为复杂语言任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models, with their strong reasoning ability and rich
knowledge, have brought revolution to many tasks of AI, but their impact on
sign language generation remains limited due to its complexity and unique
rules. In this paper, we propose TEAch Me Sign (TEAM-Sign), treating sign
language as another natural language. By fine-tuning an LLM, we enable it to
learn the correspondence between text and sign language, and facilitate
generation. Considering the differences between sign and spoken language, we
employ a stepwise prompting strategy to extract the inherent sign language
knowledge within the LLM, thereby supporting the learning and generation
process. Experimental results on How2Sign and Phoenix14T datasets demonstrate
that our approach effectively leverages both the sign language knowledge and
reasoning capabilities of LLM to align the different distribution and
grammatical rules between sign and spoken language.

Motivation: 解决文本性别歧视检测中的多任务和跨语言挑战，同时减少计算和存储开销。

Method: 采用层次化LoRA适配器，显式建模标签依赖关系，并应用于所有线性变换，而非仅注意力层。

Result: 在多任务中表现优异（F1提升1.7-2.4%），训练时间和存储需求大幅降低（75%和98%）。

Conclusion: 参数高效微调方法在性能与效率间取得平衡，适用于多语言和多任务场景。

Abstract: This paper presents our approach to EXIST 2025 Task 1, addressing text-based
sexism detection in English and Spanish tweets through hierarchical Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) of Llama 3.1 8B. Our method introduces conditional adapter
routing that explicitly models label dependencies across three hierarchically
structured subtasks: binary sexism identification, source intention detection,
and multilabel sexism categorization. Unlike conventional LoRA applications
that target only attention layers, we apply adaptation to all linear
transformations, enhancing the model's capacity to capture task-specific
patterns. In contrast to complex data processing and ensemble approaches, we
show that straightforward parameter-efficient fine-tuning achieves strong
performance. We train separate LoRA adapters (rank=16, QLoRA 4-bit) for each
subtask using unified multilingual training that leverages Llama 3.1's native
bilingual capabilities. The method requires minimal preprocessing and uses
standard supervised learning. Our multilingual training strategy eliminates the
need for separate language-specific models, achieving 1.7-2.4\% F1 improvements
through cross-lingual transfer. With only 1.67\% trainable parameters compared
to full fine-tuning, our approach reduces training time by 75\% and model
storage by 98\%, while achieving competitive performance across all subtasks
(ICM-Hard: 0.6774 for binary classification, 0.4991 for intention detection,
0.6519 for multilabel categorization).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线新闻个性化推荐系统可能加剧信息茧房和政治极化，现有立场检测研究多限于短文本和高资源语言，缺乏对长文本和多语言的支持。

Method: 提出K-News-Stance数据集和JoA-ICL框架，后者利用语言模型代理检测关键段落立场，并聚合推断全文立场。

Result: JoA-ICL在立场检测上优于现有方法，分段级代理能更准确捕捉长新闻的立场。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了韩语长文本立场检测的空白，为促进新闻多样性和媒体偏见分析提供了实用工具。

Abstract: As online news consumption grows, personalized recommendation systems have
become integral to digital journalism. However, these systems risk reinforcing
filter bubbles and political polarization by failing to incorporate diverse
perspectives. Stance detection -- identifying a text's position on a target --
can help mitigate this by enabling viewpoint-aware recommendations and
data-driven analyses of media bias. Yet, existing stance detection research
remains largely limited to short texts and high-resource languages. To address
these gaps, we introduce \textsc{K-News-Stance}, the first Korean dataset for
article-level stance detection, comprising 2,000 news articles with
article-level and 19,650 segment-level stance annotations across 47 societal
issues. We also propose \textsc{JoA-ICL}, a \textbf{Jo}urnalism-guided
\textbf{A}gentic \textbf{I}n-\textbf{C}ontext \textbf{L}earning framework that
employs a language model agent to predict the stances of key structural
segments (e.g., leads, quotes), which are then aggregated to infer the overall
article stance. Experiments show that \textsc{JoA-ICL} outperforms existing
stance detection methods, highlighting the benefits of segment-level agency in
capturing the overall position of long-form news articles. Two case studies
further demonstrate its broader utility in promoting viewpoint diversity in
news recommendations and uncovering patterns of media bias.

Conclusion: 该研究证明了LLM在临床决策支持系统中的潜力，能够提升早期预警系统，并将患者叙述转化为可操作的风险评估。

Abstract: Timely identification and accurate risk stratification of cardiovascular
disease (CVD) remain essential for reducing global mortality. While existing
prediction models primarily leverage structured data, unstructured clinical
notes contain valuable early indicators. This study introduces a novel
LLM-augmented clinical NLP pipeline that employs domain-adapted large language
models for symptom extraction, contextual reasoning, and correlation from
free-text reports. Our approach integrates cardiovascular-specific fine-tuning,
prompt-based inference, and entity-aware reasoning. Evaluations on MIMIC-III
and CARDIO-NLP datasets demonstrate improved performance in precision, recall,
F1-score, and AUROC, with high clinical relevance (kappa = 0.82) assessed by
cardiologists. Challenges such as contextual hallucination, which occurs when
plausible information contracts with provided source, and temporal ambiguity,
which is related with models struggling with chronological ordering of events
are addressed using prompt engineering and hybrid rule-based verification. This
work underscores the potential of LLMs in clinical decision support systems
(CDSS), advancing early warning systems and enhancing the translation of
patient narratives into actionable risk assessments.

Abstract: The July Revolution in Bangladesh marked a significant student-led mass
uprising, uniting people across the nation to demand justice, accountability,
and systemic reform. Social media platforms played a pivotal role in amplifying
public sentiment and shaping discourse during this historic mass uprising. In
this study, we present a hybrid transformer-based sentiment analysis framework
to decode public opinion expressed in social media comments during and after
the revolution. We used a brand new dataset of 4,200 Bangla comments collected
from social media. The framework employs advanced transformer-based feature
extraction techniques, including BanglaBERT, mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, and the
proposed hybrid XMB-BERT, to capture nuanced patterns in textual data.
Principle Component Analysis (PCA) were utilized for dimensionality reduction
to enhance computational efficiency. We explored eleven traditional and
advanced machine learning classifiers for identifying sentiments. The proposed
hybrid XMB-BERT with the voting classifier achieved an exceptional accuracy of
83.7% and outperform other model classifier combinations. This study
underscores the potential of machine learning techniques to analyze social
sentiment in low-resource languages like Bangla.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在跨境金融活动中使用大语言模型（LLMs）改进实体匹配的准确性和效率，相比传统方法表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨境金融活动的增加使得准确识别和分类外国实体变得至关重要，但传统匹配方法在语言变化和语义关系上表现不佳。

Method: 比较了传统方法（如Jaccard、余弦和Levenshtein距离）、基于Hugging Face的LLMs和接口型LLMs（如Microsoft Copilot、Alibaba's Qwen 2.5），使用65个葡萄牙公司案例数据集进行测试。

Result: 传统方法准确率超过92%，但假阳性率高（20-40%）；接口型LLMs表现更好，准确率超过93%，F1分数超过96%，假阳性率更低（40-80%）。

Conclusion: LLMs在实体匹配任务中优于传统方法，尤其在处理语言和语义复杂性时表现更佳。

Abstract: The growing prevalence of cross-border financial activities in global markets
has underscored the necessity of accurately identifying and classifying foreign
entities. This practice is essential within the Spanish financial system for
ensuring robust risk management, regulatory adherence, and the prevention of
financial misconduct. This process involves a labor-intensive entity-matching
task, where entities need to be validated against available reference sources.
Challenges arise from linguistic variations, special characters, outdated
names, and changes in legal forms, complicating traditional matching algorithms
like Jaccard, cosine, and Levenshtein distances. These methods struggle with
contextual nuances and semantic relationships, leading to mismatches. To
address these limitations, we explore Large Language Models (LLMs) as a
flexible alternative. LLMs leverage extensive training to interpret context,
handle abbreviations, and adapt to legal transitions. We evaluate traditional
methods, Hugging Face-based LLMs, and interface-based LLMs (e.g., Microsoft
Copilot, Alibaba's Qwen 2.5) using a dataset of 65 Portuguese company cases.
Results show traditional methods achieve accuracies over 92% but suffer high
false positive rates (20-40%). Interface-based LLMs outperform, achieving
accuracies above 93%, F1 scores exceeding 96%, and lower false positives
(40-80%).

Motivation: 现有对齐机制无法保护dLLMs免受上下文感知的掩码输入对抗提示攻击，揭示其独特的安全漏洞。

Method: DIJA通过构建对抗性交错掩码-文本提示，利用dLLMs的双向建模和平行解码机制，绕过安全过滤。

Result: DIJA在多个评测中显著优于现有越狱方法，最高达到100%关键词ASR，并在JailbreakBench上提升78.5%评测ASR。

Conclusion: 研究强调需重新思考dLLMs的安全对齐机制，以应对其独特威胁。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a
powerful alternative to autoregressive LLMs, offering faster inference and
greater interactivity via parallel decoding and bidirectional modeling.
However, despite strong performance in code generation and text infilling, we
identify a fundamental safety concern: existing alignment mechanisms fail to
safeguard dLLMs against context-aware, masked-input adversarial prompts,
exposing novel vulnerabilities. To this end, we present DIJA, the first
systematic study and jailbreak attack framework that exploits unique safety
weaknesses of dLLMs. Specifically, our proposed DIJA constructs adversarial
interleaved mask-text prompts that exploit the text generation mechanisms of
dLLMs, i.e., bidirectional modeling and parallel decoding. Bidirectional
modeling drives the model to produce contextually consistent outputs for masked
spans, even when harmful, while parallel decoding limits model dynamic
filtering and rejection sampling of unsafe content. This causes standard
alignment mechanisms to fail, enabling harmful completions in alignment-tuned
dLLMs, even when harmful behaviors or unsafe instructions are directly exposed
in the prompt. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that DIJA
significantly outperforms existing jailbreak methods, exposing a previously
overlooked threat surface in dLLM architectures. Notably, our method achieves
up to 100% keyword-based ASR on Dream-Instruct, surpassing the strongest prior
baseline, ReNeLLM, by up to 78.5% in evaluator-based ASR on JailbreakBench and
by 37.7 points in StrongREJECT score, while requiring no rewriting or hiding of
harmful content in the jailbreak prompt. Our findings underscore the urgent
need for rethinking safety alignment in this emerging class of language models.

Result: 发现多触发器可共存且激活稳健，暴露LLMs更广泛的漏洞；防御方法能高效移除触发器行为。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了LLMs的多触发器中毒风险，并提供了实用的防御方案。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to
data poisoning attacks, where malicious training examples embed hidden
behaviours triggered by specific input patterns. However, most existing works
assume a phrase and focus on the attack's effectiveness, offering limited
understanding of trigger mechanisms and how multiple triggers interact within
the model. In this paper, we present a framework for studying poisoning in
LLMs. We show that multiple distinct backdoor triggers can coexist within a
single model without interfering with each other, enabling adversaries to embed
several triggers concurrently. Using multiple triggers with high embedding
similarity, we demonstrate that poisoned triggers can achieve robust activation
even when tokens are substituted or separated by long token spans. Our findings
expose a broader and more persistent vulnerability surface in LLMs. To mitigate
this threat, we propose a post hoc recovery method that selectively retrains
specific model components based on a layer-wise weight difference analysis. Our
method effectively removes the trigger behaviour with minimal parameter
updates, presenting a practical and efficient defence against multi-trigger
poisoning.

integrates Gemini 2.5 Flash for visual description, Gemini 1.5 Pro for caption
refinement and consistency checks, and Gemini 2.5 Pro as a reasoner which
handles final answer selection, all coordinated through carefully engineered
few-shot and zero-shot prompts. We conducted an extensive ablation study,
training several large language models (Gemini 2.5 Flash, Phi 4, Gemma 3,
Mistral) on an English dataset and its multilingual augmented version.
Additionally, we evaluated Gemini 2.5 Flash in a zero-shot setting for
comparison and found it to substantially outperform the trained models. Prompt
design also proved critical: enforcing concise, language-normalized formats and
prohibiting explanatory text boosted model accuracy on the English validation
set from 55.9% to 61.7%. On the official leaderboard, our system (Team MSA)
achieved first place overall in the multilingual track with 81.4% accuracy, and
led 11 out of 13 individual language tracks, with top results such as 95.07%
for Croatian and 92.12% for Italian. These findings highlight that lightweight
OCR-VLM ensembles, when paired with precise prompt strategies and cross-lingual

Motivation: 解决LLMs在GDPR（特别是“被遗忘权”）下的隐私合规问题，现有方法无法识别模型中存储的具体个人数据。

Method: 引入WikiMem数据集和模型无关的度量方法，通过校准负对数似然对真实值与反事实进行排序。

Result: 评估显示记忆程度与个体网络存在感和模型规模相关。

Conclusion: 为动态构建遗忘集以支持机器遗忘和RTBF请求提供了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can memorize and reveal personal information,
raising concerns regarding compliance with the EU's GDPR, particularly the
Right to Be Forgotten (RTBF). Existing machine unlearning methods assume the
data to forget is already known but do not address how to identify which
individual-fact associations are stored in the model. Privacy auditing
techniques typically operate at the population level or target a small set of
identifiers, limiting applicability to individual-level data inquiries. We
introduce WikiMem, a dataset of over 5,000 natural language canaries covering
243 human-related properties from Wikidata, and a model-agnostic metric to
quantify human-fact associations in LLMs. Our approach ranks ground-truth
values against counterfactuals using calibrated negative log-likelihood across
paraphrased prompts. We evaluate 200 individuals across 15 LLMs (410M-70B
parameters), showing that memorization correlates with subject web presence and
model scale. We provide a foundation for identifying memorized personal data in
LLMs at the individual level, enabling the dynamic construction of forget sets
for machine unlearning and RTBF requests.

Motivation: 探索多智能体系统（MAS）在定性研究中的潜力，尤其是其在编码和数据标注任务中的表现。

Method: 通过实验研究，使用六种开源LLM和18种配置，分析了77,000多个编码决策，比较了单智能体与多智能体系统的表现。

Result: 温度和智能体角色显著影响共识构建，但未显著提升编码准确性；单智能体在多数情况下表现优于MAS。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM在定性研究中的局限性，挑战了多样MAS角色能带来更好结果的假设，并开源了实验代码。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable new possibilities for qualitative
research at scale, including coding and data annotation. While multi-agent
systems (MAS) can emulate human coding workflows, their benefits over
single-agent coding remain poorly understood. We conducted an experimental
study of how agent persona and temperature shape consensus-building and coding
accuracy of dialog segments based on a codebook with 8 codes. Our open-source
MAS mirrors deductive human coding through structured agent discussion and
consensus arbitration. Using six open-source LLMs (with 3 to 32 billion
parameters) and 18 experimental configurations, we analyze over 77,000 coding
decisions against a gold-standard dataset of human-annotated transcripts from
online math tutoring sessions. Temperature significantly impacted whether and
when consensus was reached across all six LLMs. MAS with multiple personas
(including neutral, assertive, or empathetic), significantly delayed consensus
in four out of six LLMs compared to uniform personas. In three of those LLMs,
higher temperatures significantly diminished the effects of multiple personas
on consensus. However, neither temperature nor persona pairing lead to robust
improvements in coding accuracy. Single agents matched or outperformed MAS
consensus in most conditions. Only one model (OpenHermesV2:7B) and code
category showed above-chance gains from MAS deliberation when temperature was
0.5 or lower and especially when the agents included at least one assertive
persona. Qualitative analysis of MAS collaboration for these configurations
suggests that MAS may nonetheless aid in narrowing ambiguous code applications
that could improve codebooks and human-AI coding. We contribute new insight
into the limits of LLM-based qualitative methods, challenging the notion that
diverse MAS personas lead to better outcomes. We open-source our MAS and
experimentation code.

assess social bias across 10 categories using a multiple-choice QA setting, now
adapted to the Spanish and Catalan languages and to the social context of
Spain. We report evaluation results on different LLMs, factoring in model
family, size and variant. Our results show that models tend to fail to choose
the correct answer in ambiguous scenarios, and that high QA accuracy often
correlates with greater reliance on social biases.

TL;DR: FlowFSM是一个基于LLM的框架，通过提示链和思维链推理从RFC文档中提取精确的FSM，解决了现有技术的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FSM提取技术在可扩展性、覆盖范围和自然语言规范模糊性方面存在不足，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: FlowFSM结合LLM、提示链和思维链推理，系统处理协议规范，识别状态转换并构建结构化规则书。

Result: 在FTP和RTSP协议上的实验表明，FlowFSM提取精度高，且减少了虚假转换。

Conclusion: FlowFSM展示了基于代理的LLM系统在协议分析和FSM推断中的潜力，适用于网络安全和逆向工程。

Abstract: Finite-State Machines (FSMs) are critical for modeling the operational logic
of network protocols, enabling verification, analysis, and vulnerability
discovery. However, existing FSM extraction techniques face limitations such as
scalability, incomplete coverage, and ambiguity in natural language
specifications. In this paper, we propose FlowFSM, a novel agentic framework
that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with prompt chaining and
chain-of-thought reasoning to extract accurate FSMs from raw RFC documents.
FlowFSM systematically processes protocol specifications, identifies state
transitions, and constructs structured rule-books by chaining agent outputs.
Experimental evaluation across FTP and RTSP protocols demonstrates that FlowFSM
achieves high extraction precision while minimizing hallucinated transitions,
showing promising results. Our findings highlight the potential of agent-based
LLM systems in the advancement of protocol analysis and FSM inference for
cybersecurity and reverse engineering applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于稀疏自编码器（SAE）的方法SAE-LAPE，用于识别大语言模型（LLM）中的语言特定特征，并发现这些特征主要分布在模型的中后层，对多语言性能和语言输出有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大语言模型的多语言机制仍具挑战性，现有研究多关注单个神经元，但其多义性难以分离语言特定特征。

Method: 采用稀疏自编码器（SAE）学习单义特征，并引入SAE-LAPE方法，基于特征激活概率识别语言特定特征。

Result: 发现语言特定特征主要分布在模型的中后层，具有可解释性，且可用于语言识别，性能与fastText相当但更具可解释性。

Conclusion: SAE-LAPE方法有效识别了语言特定特征，为理解LLM的多语言机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Understanding the multilingual mechanisms of large language models (LLMs)
provides insight into how they process different languages, yet this remains
challenging. Existing studies often focus on individual neurons, but their
polysemantic nature makes it difficult to isolate language-specific units from
cross-lingual representations. To address this, we explore sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) for their ability to learn monosemantic features that represent concrete
and abstract concepts across languages in LLMs. While some of these features
are language-independent, the presence of language-specific features remains
underexplored. In this work, we introduce SAE-LAPE, a method based on feature
activation probability, to identify language-specific features within the
feed-forward network. We find that many such features predominantly appear in
the middle to final layers of the model and are interpretable. These features
influence the model's multilingual performance and language output and can be
used for language identification with performance comparable to fastText along
with more interpretability. Our code is available at

TL;DR: KV-Latent通过降采样Key-Value向量维度至潜在空间，显著减少KV Cache占用并提升推理速度，仅需少量额外训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decoder架构的Key-Value缓存逐渐增加成为推理效率瓶颈，影响内存消耗和数据传输带宽。

Method: 提出KV-Latent范式，降采样KV向量至潜在空间，并改进Rotary Positional Embedding的频率采样机制以增强稳定性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在减少KV Cache占用和提升推理速度方面效果显著，且对模型性能影响较小。

Conclusion: KV-Latent为构建高效语言模型系统提供了新思路，并开启了KV Cache优化的新可能性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based on Transformer Decoders have become the
preferred choice for conversational generative AI. Despite the overall
superiority of the Decoder architecture, the gradually increasing Key-Value
(KV) cache during inference has emerged as a primary efficiency bottleneck,
both in aspects of memory consumption and data transfer bandwidth limitations.
To address these challenges, we propose a paradigm called KV-Latent. By
down-sampling the Key-Value vector dimensions into a latent space, we can
significantly reduce the KV Cache footprint and improve inference speed, only
with a small amount of extra training, less than 1\% of pre-training takes.
Besides, we enhanced the stability of Rotary Positional Embedding applied on
lower-dimensional vectors by modifying its frequency sampling mechanism,
avoiding noise introduced by higher frequencies while retaining position
attenuation. Our experiments, including both models with Grouped Query
Attention and those without, have yielded satisfactory results. Finally, we
conducted comparative experiments to study the impact of separately reducing
Key and Value components on model's performance. Our approach allows for the
construction of more efficient language model systems, and opens the new
possibility on KV Cache saving and efficient LLMs. Our code is available at

Abstract: Efficient and accurate autoformalization methods, which leverage large-scale
datasets of extensive natural language mathematical problems to construct
formal language datasets, are key to advancing formal mathematical reasoning.
In this paper, we propose an autoformalization pipeline based on large language
models with error feedback, achieving a fully automatic and training-free
formalization approach. Using this pipeline, we curate an Olympiad-level
dataset aligning natural language problems with Lean formalizations. The
dataset comprises $3,922$ mathematical problems in natural language and $9,787$

making it suitable as a benchmark for automated theorem provers. Additionally,
we investigate the formalization and reasoning capabilities of various LLMs and
empirically demonstrate that few-shot learning, error feedback, and increasing
sampling numbers enhance the autoformalization process. Experiments of three
automated theorem provers on the \dataset\ dataset also highlight its
challenging nature and its value as a benchmark for formal reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: 该研究填补了中文仇恨言论检测的资源空白，提升了模型的可解释性和检测性能。

Abstract: The proliferation of hate speech has inflicted significant societal harm,
with its intensity and directionality closely tied to specific targets and
arguments. In recent years, numerous machine learning-based methods have been
developed to detect hateful comments on online platforms automatically.
However, research on Chinese hate speech detection lags behind, and
interpretability studies face two major challenges: first, the scarcity of
span-level fine-grained annotated datasets limits models' deep semantic
understanding of hate speech; second, insufficient research on identifying and
interpreting coded hate speech restricts model explainability in complex
real-world scenarios. To address these, we make the following contributions:
(1) We introduce the Span-level Target-Aware Toxicity Extraction dataset (STATE
ToxiCN), the first span-level Chinese hate speech dataset, and evaluate the
hate semantic understanding of existing models using it. (2) We conduct the
first comprehensive study on Chinese coded hate terms, LLMs' ability to
interpret hate semantics. (3) We propose a method to integrate an annotated
lexicon into models, significantly enhancing hate speech detection performance.
Our work provides valuable resources and insights to advance the
interpretability of Chinese hate speech detection research.

Dr.Copilot provides feedback along 17 interpretable axes. The system comprises
of three LLM agents with prompts automatically optimized via DSPy. Designed
with low-resource Romanian data and deployed using open-weight models, it
delivers real-time specific feedback to doctors within a telemedicine platform.
Empirical evaluations and live deployment with 41 doctors show measurable
improvements in user reviews and response quality, marking one of the first
real-world deployments of LLMs in Romanian medical settings.

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values has attracted
increasing attention since it provides clarity, transparency, and the ability
to adapt to evolving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a Controlled Value
Vector Activation (ConVA) method that directly aligns the internal values of
LLMs by interpreting how a value is encoded in their latent representations and
modifies relevant activations to ensure consistent values in LLMs. To ensure an
accurate and unbiased interpretation, we propose a context-controlled value
vector identification method. To consistently control values without
sacrificing model performance, we introduce a gated value vector activation
method for effective and minimum degree of value control. Experiments show that
our method achieves the highest control success rate across 10 basic values
without hurting LLM performance and fluency, and ensures target values even
with opposite and potentially malicious input prompts. Source code and data are

Motivation: 传统的新颖性评估方法（专家判断或引用组合）存在局限性，如专家知识有限或引用组合效果不确定。结合人类判断能力和LLM的知识可以弥补这些不足。

Method: 从同行评审报告中提取新颖性句子，用LLM总结论文方法部分，用于微调PLM；设计文本引导融合模块（Sparse-Attention）整合人类和LLM知识。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在评估方法新颖性方面优于大量基线。

Conclusion: 结合人类专家和LLM的方法能有效评估学术论文的方法新颖性，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Novelty is a crucial criterion in the peer review process for evaluating
academic papers. Traditionally, it's judged by experts or measure by unique
reference combinations. Both methods have limitations: experts have limited
knowledge, and the effectiveness of the combination method is uncertain.
Moreover, it's unclear if unique citations truly measure novelty. The large
language model (LLM) possesses a wealth of knowledge, while human experts
possess judgment abilities that the LLM does not possess. Therefore, our
research integrates the knowledge and abilities of LLM and human experts to
address the limitations of novelty assessment. The most common novelty in
academic papers is the introduction of new methods. In this paper, we propose
leveraging human knowledge and LLM to assist pretrained language models (PLMs,
e.g. BERT etc.) in predicting the method novelty of papers. Specifically, we
extract sentences related to the novelty of the academic paper from peer review
reports and use LLM to summarize the methodology section of the academic paper,
which are then used to fine-tune PLMs. In addition, we have designed a
text-guided fusion module with novel Sparse-Attention to better integrate human
and LLM knowledge. We compared the method we proposed with a large number of
baselines. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior
performance.

Motivation: 现有PMR在结构、复杂性和可用性上差异大，且缺乏系统比较，导致LLM支持的流程模型生成（PMG）任务难以评估。

Method: 通过PMo数据集（包含55个流程描述及九种PMR模型），评估PMR在LLM支持的PMo中的适用性和PMG性能。

Result: Mermaid在六项PMo标准中得分最高，BPMN text在流程元素相似性上表现最佳。

Conclusion: 研究为PMo任务中PMR的选择提供了实证依据，Mermaid和BPMN text在不同维度表现突出。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied for Process Modeling
(PMo) tasks such as Process Model Generation (PMG). To support these tasks,
researchers have introduced a variety of Process Model Representations (PMRs)
that serve as model abstractions or generation targets. However, these PMRs
differ widely in structure, complexity, and usability, and have never been
systematically compared. Moreover, recent PMG approaches rely on distinct
evaluation strategies and generation techniques, making comparison difficult.
This paper presents the first empirical study that evaluates multiple PMRs in
the context of PMo with LLMs. We introduce the PMo Dataset, a new dataset
containing 55 process descriptions paired with models in nine different PMRs.
We evaluate PMRs along two dimensions: suitability for LLM-based PMo and
performance on PMG. \textit{Mermaid} achieves the highest overall score across
six PMo criteria, whereas \textit{BPMN text} delivers the best PMG results in
terms of process element similarity.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在评估中因数据污染导致性能指标虚高的问题，提升模型泛化能力的可信评估。

Method: 提出Data Contamination Risk (DCR)框架，通过四个粒度级别（语义、信息、数据和标签）检测污染，并使用模糊推理系统合成污染分数。

Result: 在9个LLMs上验证，DCR框架能可靠诊断污染严重程度，调整后的准确率与未污染基准相比平均误差在4%以内。

Conclusion: DCR框架高效透明，为常规评估提供实用工具，促进公平比较并增强LLM基准测试的可信度。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has heightened concerns
about benchmark data contamination (BDC), where models inadvertently memorize
evaluation data, inflating performance metrics and undermining genuine
generalization assessment. This paper introduces the Data Contamination Risk
(DCR) framework, a lightweight, interpretable pipeline designed to detect and
quantify BDC across four granular levels: semantic, informational, data, and
label. By synthesizing contamination scores via a fuzzy inference system, DCR
produces a unified DCR Factor that adjusts raw accuracy to reflect
contamination-aware performance. Validated on 9 LLMs (0.5B-72B) across
sentiment analysis, fake news detection, and arithmetic reasoning tasks, the
DCR framework reliably diagnoses contamination severity and with accuracy
adjusted using the DCR Factor to within 4% average error across the three
benchmarks compared to the uncontaminated baseline. Emphasizing computational
efficiency and transparency, DCR provides a practical tool for integrating
contamination assessment into routine evaluations, fostering fairer comparisons
and enhancing the credibility of LLM benchmarking practices.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought traces have been shown to improve performance of large
language models in a plethora of reasoning tasks, yet there is no consensus on
the mechanism through which this performance boost is achieved. To shed more
light on this, we introduce Causal CoT Graphs (CCGs), which are directed
acyclic graphs automatically extracted from reasoning traces that model
fine-grained causal dependencies in the language model output. A collection of
$1671$ mathematical reasoning problems from MATH500, GSM8K and AIME, and their
associated CCGs are compiled into our dataset -- \textbf{KisMATH}. Our detailed
empirical analysis with 15 open-weight LLMs shows that (i) reasoning nodes in
the CCG are mediators for the final answer, a condition necessary for
reasoning; and (ii) LLMs emphasise reasoning paths given by the CCG, indicating
that models internally realise structures akin to our graphs. KisMATH enables
controlled, graph-aligned interventions and opens up avenues for further
investigation into the role of chain-of-thought in LLM reasoning.

Conclusion: 结论是编码器-解码器架构各有优势，互相适应效果有限，开源了所有研究材料以促进未来研究。

Abstract: The large language model (LLM) community focuses almost exclusively on
decoder-only language models, since they are easier to use for text generation.
However, a large subset of the community still uses encoder-only models for
tasks such as classification or retrieval. Previous work has attempted to
compare these architectures, but is forced to make comparisons with models that
have different numbers of parameters, training techniques, and datasets. We
introduce the SOTA open-data Ettin suite of models: paired encoder-only and
decoder-only models ranging from 17 million parameters to 1 billion, trained on
up to 2 trillion tokens. Using the same recipe for both encoder-only and
decoder-only models produces SOTA recipes in both categories for their
respective sizes, beating ModernBERT as an encoder and Llama 3.2 and SmolLM2 as
decoders. Like previous work, we find that encoder-only models excel at
classification and retrieval tasks while decoders excel at generative tasks.
However, we show that adapting a decoder model to encoder tasks (and vice
versa) through continued training is subpar compared to using only the reverse
objective (i.e. a 400M encoder outperforms a 1B decoder on MNLI, and vice versa
for generative tasks). We open-source all artifacts of this study including
training data, training order segmented by checkpoint, and 200+ checkpoints to
allow future work to analyze or extend all aspects of training.

Abstract: Human reasoning involves different strategies, each suited to specific

single reasoning strategy, potentially limiting their effectiveness in diverse
reasoning challenges. In this work, we investigate whether prompting can
control LLMs reasoning strategies and assess its impact on logical

consistently improves accuracy, performance could be enhanced if models could
adaptively choose the optimal strategy. We propose methods to guide LLMs in
strategy selection, highlighting new ways to refine their reasoning abilities.

Method: 基于DeepSeek架构，通过全参数微调和检索增强生成（RAG）技术，开发了HKGAI-V1，并设计了对抗性香港价值基准进行评估。

Result: HKGAI-V1在本地文化敏感查询上优于通用模型，并实现了"治理嵌入式"的数字主权，同时开发了评估工具。

Conclusion: 论文提供了一个可复制的蓝图，用于开发符合区域特点的AI系统，强调本地身份和治理的重要性。

Abstract: This paper presents the development of HKGAI-V1, a foundational sovereign
large language model (LLM), developed as part of an initiative to establish
value-aligned AI infrastructure specifically tailored for Hong Kong. Addressing
the region's unique multilingual environment (Cantonese, Mandarin, and
English), its distinct socio-legal context under the "one country, two systems"
framework, and specific local cultural and value considerations, the model is
built upon the DeepSeek architecture and systematically aligned with regional
norms through a multifaceted full parameter fine-tuning process. It is further
integrated with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system to ensure timely
and factually grounded information access. The core contribution lies in the
design and implementation of a comprehensive, region-specific AI alignment and
safety framework, demonstrated through two key achievements: 1) The successful
development of HKGAI-V1 itself - which outper-forms general-purpose models in
handling Hong Kong-specific culturally sensitive queries, and embodies a
"governance-embedded" approach to digital sovereignty - empowers Hong Kong to
exercise control over AI applications in critical sectors including public
services, legal systems, and edu-cation. 2) The development of the proprietary
Adversarial HK Value Benchmark, a rigorous tool for evaluating model alignment
with local ethical and legal stand-ards under challenging conditions. By
documenting these achievements, the paper provides not only a technological
artifact but also a replicable blueprint for developing advanced, regionally
focused AI systems deeply rooted in their local identities.

Motivation: 探讨在酒店亮点摘要生成中，如何有效评估内容对输入数据的忠实性，以解决LLM生成内容的质量和可靠性问题。

Method: 通过人类评估活动，包括分类错误评估和细粒度标注，比较传统指标、可训练方法和LLM评估方法。

Result: 简单指标（如词重叠）与人类判断相关性高（Spearman秩相关系数0.63），而LLM评估存在严重偏差。

Conclusion: LLM生成摘要质量高但评估不可靠，简单指标在跨域数据中表现优异，需注意错误信息的业务风险。

Abstract: We examine evaluation of faithfulness to input data in the context of hotel
highlights: brief LLM-generated summaries that capture unique features of
accommodations. Through human evaluation campaigns involving categorical error
assessment and span-level annotation, we compare traditional metrics, trainable
methods, and LLM-as-a-judge approaches. Our findings reveal that simpler
metrics like word overlap correlate surprisingly well with human judgments
(Spearman correlation rank of 0.63), often outperforming more complex methods
when applied to out-of-domain data. We further demonstrate that while LLMs can
generate high-quality highlights, they prove unreliable for evaluation as they
tend to severely under- or over-annotate. Our analysis of real-world business
impacts shows incorrect and non-checkable information pose the greatest risks.
We also highlight challenges in crowdsourced evaluations.

### [48] [CWNet: Causal Wavelet Network for Low-Light Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10689)
*Tongshun Zhang,Pingping Liu,Yubing Lu,Mengen Cai,Zijian Zhang,Zhe Zhang,Qiuzhan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CWNet是一种基于小波变换和因果推理的低光图像增强方法，通过全局和局部策略优化语义信息和频率恢复，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统低光图像增强方法忽略了实例级语义信息和特征特性，CWNet旨在通过因果推理和小波变换解决这些问题。

Method: CWNet包含两部分：1）全局因果嵌入和局部实例级语义损失；2）基于小波变换的主干网络优化频率信息恢复。

Result: 实验表明，CWNet在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CWNet通过因果推理和小波变换，实现了更精确的低光图像增强。

Abstract: Traditional Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) methods primarily focus on
uniform brightness adjustment, often neglecting instance-level semantic
information and the inherent characteristics of different features. To address
these limitations, we propose CWNet (Causal Wavelet Network), a novel
architecture that leverages wavelet transforms for causal reasoning.
Specifically, our approach comprises two key components: 1) Inspired by the
concept of intervention in causality, we adopt a causal reasoning perspective
to reveal the underlying causal relationships in low-light enhancement. From a
global perspective, we employ a metric learning strategy to ensure causal
embeddings adhere to causal principles, separating them from non-causal
confounding factors while focusing on the invariance of causal factors. At the
local level, we introduce an instance-level CLIP semantic loss to precisely
maintain causal factor consistency. 2) Based on our causal analysis, we present
a wavelet transform-based backbone network that effectively optimizes the
recovery of frequency information, ensuring precise enhancement tailored to the
specific attributes of wavelet transforms. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that CWNet significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods across
multiple datasets, showcasing its robust performance across diverse scenes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种整合外部生物知识的新框架，通过解耦扰动特异性和细胞系特异性表征，提升显微镜图像分析模型在新细胞系上的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高通量筛选技术在新细胞系上的应用面临形态和生物学异质性挑战，需改进现有模型。

Method: 结合蛋白质相互作用知识图谱和单细胞转录组特征，解耦扰动与细胞系特异性表征。

Result: 在RxRx数据库上验证，模型在新细胞系上的显微镜图像分析性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于表型的药物发现提供了有效工具。

Abstract: High-throughput screening techniques, such as microscopy imaging of cellular
responses to genetic and chemical perturbations, play a crucial role in drug
discovery and biomedical research. However, robust perturbation screening for
\textit{de novo} cell lines remains challenging due to the significant
morphological and biological heterogeneity across cell lines. To address this,
we propose a novel framework that integrates external biological knowledge into
existing pretraining strategies to enhance microscopy image profiling models.
Our approach explicitly disentangles perturbation-specific and cell
line-specific representations using external biological information.
Specifically, we construct a knowledge graph leveraging protein interaction
data from STRING and Hetionet databases to guide models toward
perturbation-specific features during pretraining. Additionally, we incorporate
transcriptomic features from single-cell foundation models to capture cell
line-specific representations. By learning these disentangled features, our
method improves the generalization of imaging models to \textit{de novo} cell
lines. We evaluate our framework on the RxRx database through one-shot
fine-tuning on an RxRx1 cell line and few-shot fine-tuning on cell lines from
the RxRx19a dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances
microscopy image profiling for \textit{de novo} cell lines, highlighting its
effectiveness in real-world phenotype-based drug discovery applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决FER算法在自然表情和不同肤色人群上性能下降的问题，揭示数据集收集中的问题。

Method: 随机抽样审计数据集，提出区分自然与摆拍图像的方法，并测试模型对不同肤色人群的预测表现。

Result: 发现数据集中摆拍图像较多，模型对非白人或深肤色人群存在负面情绪预测偏见。

Conclusion: 数据集和模型存在偏差，可能在实际应用中造成危害，需改进数据收集和模型训练方法。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) algorithms classify facial expressions
into emotions such as happy, sad, or angry. An evaluative challenge facing FER
algorithms is the fall in performance when detecting spontaneous expressions
compared to posed expressions. An ethical (and evaluative) challenge facing FER
algorithms is that they tend to perform poorly for people of some races and
skin colors. These challenges are linked to the data collection practices
employed in the creation of FER datasets. In this study, we audit two
state-of-the-art FER datasets. We take random samples from each dataset and
examine whether images are spontaneous or posed. In doing so, we propose a
methodology for identifying spontaneous or posed images. We discover a
significant number of images that were posed in the datasets purporting to
consist of in-the-wild images. Since performance of FER models vary between
spontaneous and posed images, the performance of models trained on these
datasets will not represent the true performance if such models were to be
deployed in in-the-wild applications. We also observe the skin color of
individuals in the samples, and test three models trained on each of the
datasets to predict facial expressions of people from various races and skin
tones. We find that the FER models audited were more likely to predict people
labeled as not white or determined to have dark skin as showing a negative
emotion such as anger or sadness even when they were smiling. This bias makes
such models prone to perpetuate harm in real life applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需为兴趣点分配描述符并基于相似性匹配，计算和存储开销大。

Method: 在检测时直接关联兴趣点，无需描述符。

Result: 匹配精度略低于传统方法，但内存使用大幅减少。

Conclusion: 该方法在内存效率上优于传统和现代学习方法。

Abstract: The extraction and matching of interest points are fundamental to many
geometric computer vision tasks. Traditionally, matching is performed by
assigning descriptors to interest points and identifying correspondences based
on descriptor similarity. This work introduces a technique where interest
points are inherently associated during detection, eliminating the need for
computing, storing, transmitting, or matching descriptors. Although the
matching accuracy is marginally lower than that of conventional approaches, our
method completely eliminates the need for descriptors, leading to a drastic
reduction in memory usage for localization systems. We assess its effectiveness
by comparing it against both classical handcrafted methods and modern learned
approaches.

Motivation: 航天器在太空环境中易受损害，人工或机器人维修成本高且风险大，因此需要开发可靠的自主检测系统。

Method: 创建了一个包含64k标注图像的航天器数据集，结合真实和合成背景，并添加噪声和失真。使用YOLOv8和YOLOv11模型进行微调，并在硬件和时间约束下评估性能。

Result: 模型在测试中达到了Dice分数0.92，Hausdorff距离0.69，推理时间约0.5秒。

Conclusion: 提出的数据集和模型为航天器实时图像分割提供了有效解决方案，支持自主检测系统的开发。

Abstract: Spacecraft deployed in outer space are routinely subjected to various forms
of damage due to exposure to hazardous environments. In addition, there are
significant risks to the subsequent process of in-space repairs through human
extravehicular activity or robotic manipulation, incurring substantial
operational costs. Recent developments in image segmentation could enable the
development of reliable and cost-effective autonomous inspection systems. While
these models often require large amounts of training data to achieve
satisfactory results, publicly available annotated spacecraft segmentation data
are very scarce. Here, we present a new dataset of nearly 64k annotated
spacecraft images that was created using real spacecraft models, superimposed
on a mixture of real and synthetic backgrounds generated using NASA's TTALOS
pipeline. To mimic camera distortions and noise in real-world image
acquisition, we also added different types of noise and distortion to the
images. Finally, we finetuned YOLOv8 and YOLOv11 segmentation models to
generate performance benchmarks for the dataset under well-defined hardware and
inference time constraints to mimic real-world image segmentation challenges
for real-time onboard applications in space on NASA's inspector spacecraft. The
resulting models, when tested under these constraints, achieved a Dice score of
0.92, Hausdorff distance of 0.69, and an inference time of about 0.5 second.

TL;DR: ThinkingViT是一种嵌套ViT架构，通过动态调整计算资源提升效率，优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定计算预算的Vision Transformers无法适应异构硬件，且现有嵌套模型对所有输入分配相同计算资源，效率低下。

Method: 引入ThinkingViT，采用渐进式思考阶段和Token Recycling机制，动态调整计算资源。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上，ThinkingViT在相同吞吐量下准确率提升2.0 p.p.，相同GMACs下提升2.9 p.p.。

Conclusion: ThinkingViT通过动态计算分配显著提升效率，可作为现有ViT的插件升级。

Abstract: Vision Transformers deliver state-of-the-art performance, yet their fixed
computational budget prevents scalable deployment across heterogeneous
hardware. Recent nested Transformer architectures mitigate this by embedding
nested subnetworks within a single model to enable scalable inference. However,
these models allocate the same amount of compute to all inputs, regardless of
their complexity, which leads to inefficiencies. To address this, we introduce
ThinkingViT, a nested ViT architecture that employs progressive thinking stages
to dynamically adjust inference computation based on input difficulty.
ThinkingViT initiates inference by activating a small subset of the most
important attention heads and terminates early if predictions reach sufficient
certainty. Otherwise, it activates additional attention heads and re-evaluates
the input. At the core of ThinkingViT is our Token Recycling mechanism, which
conditions each subsequent inference stage on the embeddings from the previous
stage, enabling progressive improvement. Due to its backbone-preserving design,
ThinkingViT also serves as a plugin upgrade for vanilla ViT. Experiments show
that ThinkingViT surpasses nested baselines by up to 2.0 percentage points
(p.p.) in accuracy at the same throughput and by up to 2.9 p.p. at equal GMACs
on ImageNet-1K. The source code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM的自主目标检测框架（LAOD），通过动态生成场景特定对象名称，实现无需标签的零样本检测，并引入新指标CAAP和SNAP分别评估定位和命名性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统目标检测依赖固定类别集，灵活性不足；现有开放世界和开放词汇检测方法（OWOD和OVOD）存在语义标签缺失或依赖用户提示的问题，限制了自主性。

Method: 利用大型语言模型（LLM）生成场景特定对象名称，结合开放词汇检测器进行定位，实现动态目标检测。

Result: 在LVIS、COCO和COCO-OOD数据集上验证了方法的有效性，展示了检测和命名新对象的强大性能。

Conclusion: LAOD框架提升了开放世界理解的自主性和适应性。

Abstract: Object detection traditionally relies on fixed category sets, requiring
costly re-training to handle novel objects. While Open-World and
Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OWOD and OVOD) improve flexibility, OWOD
lacks semantic labels for unknowns, and OVOD depends on user prompts, limiting
autonomy. We propose an LLM-guided agentic object detection (LAOD) framework
that enables fully label-free, zero-shot detection by prompting a Large
Language Model (LLM) to generate scene-specific object names. These are passed
to an open-vocabulary detector for localization, allowing the system to adapt
its goals dynamically. We introduce two new metrics, Class-Agnostic Average
Precision (CAAP) and Semantic Naming Average Precision (SNAP), to separately
evaluate localization and naming. Experiments on LVIS, COCO, and COCO-OOD
validate our approach, showing strong performance in detecting and naming novel
objects. Our method offers enhanced autonomy and adaptability for open-world
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Winsor-CAM是一种改进的Grad-CAM方法，通过跨卷积层聚合信息并应用Winsorization技术，生成更鲁棒和连贯的显著性图，提升了模型决策的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在关键领域部署CNN模型时，理解其决策过程至关重要。Grad-CAM等方法通常仅关注最后一层卷积层或简单平均多层信息，可能掩盖重要语义或放大噪声。

Method: 提出Winsor-CAM，通过Winsorization技术（基于百分位的异常值衰减）聚合所有卷积层信息，并允许用户通过阈值进行语义级调整。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC 2012数据集上测试，Winsor-CAM生成的显著性图更易解释，且在定位指标（如IoU和中心对齐）上优于Grad-CAM和均匀层平均基线。

Conclusion: Winsor-CAM通过提供多层级解释和人工控制，推动了可信AI的发展。

Abstract: Interpreting the decision-making process of Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) is critical for deploying models in high-stakes domains.
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) is a widely used method
for visual explanations, yet it typically focuses on the final convolutional
layer or na\"ively averages across layers, strategies that can obscure
important semantic cues or amplify irrelevant noise. We propose Winsor-CAM, a
novel, human-tunable extension of Grad-CAM that generates robust and coherent
saliency maps by aggregating information across all convolutional layers. To
mitigate the influence of noisy or extreme attribution values, Winsor-CAM
applies Winsorization, a percentile-based outlier attenuation technique. A
user-controllable threshold allows for semantic-level tuning, enabling flexible
exploration of model behavior across representational hierarchies. Evaluations
on standard architectures (ResNet50, DenseNet121, VGG16, InceptionV3) using the
PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset demonstrate that Winsor-CAM produces more interpretable
heatmaps and achieves superior performance in localization metrics, including
intersection-over-union and center-of-mass alignment, when compared to Grad-CAM
and uniform layer-averaging baselines. Winsor-CAM advances the goal of
trustworthy AI by offering interpretable, multi-layer insights with
human-in-the-loop control.

Conclusion: 稀疏编码框架提高了模型的可解释性和任务适应性。

Abstract: Large pre-trained transformers have revolutionized artificial intelligence
across various domains, and fine-tuning remains the dominant approach for
adapting these models to downstream tasks due to the cost of training from
scratch. However, in existing fine-tuning methods, the updated representations
are formed as a dense combination of modified parameters, making it challenging
to interpret their contributions and understand how the model adapts to new
tasks. In this work, we introduce a fine-tuning framework inspired by sparse
coding, where fine-tuned features are represented as a sparse combination of
basic elements, i.e., feature dictionary atoms. The feature dictionary atoms
function as fundamental building blocks of the representation, and tuning atoms
allows for seamless adaptation to downstream tasks. Sparse coefficients then
serve as indicators of atom importance, identifying the contribution of each
atom to the updated representation. Leveraging the atom selection capability of
sparse coefficients, we first demonstrate that our method enhances image
editing performance by improving text alignment through the removal of
unimportant feature dictionary atoms. Additionally, we validate the
effectiveness of our approach in the text-to-image concept customization task,
where our method efficiently constructs the target concept using a sparse
combination of feature dictionary atoms, outperforming various baseline
fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: Objectives: Timely and accurate detection of colorectal polyps plays a
crucial role in diagnosing and preventing colorectal cancer, a major cause of
mortality worldwide. This study introduces a new, lightweight, and efficient
framework for polyp detection that combines the Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
algorithm for filtering noisy data with the YOLO-v11n deep learning model.
  Study design: An experimental study leveraging deep learning and outlier
removal techniques across multiple public datasets.
  Methods: The proposed approach was tested on five diverse and publicly
available datasets: CVC-ColonDB, CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, ETIS, and EndoScene.
Since these datasets originally lacked bounding box annotations, we converted
their segmentation masks into suitable detection labels. To enhance the
robustness and generalizability of our model, we apply 5-fold cross-validation
and remove anomalous samples using the LOF method configured with 30 neighbors
and a contamination ratio of 5%. Cleaned data are then fed into YOLO-v11n, a
fast and resource-efficient object detection architecture optimized for
real-time applications. We train the model using a combination of modern
augmentation strategies to improve detection accuracy under diverse conditions.
  Results: Our approach significantly improves polyp localization performance,
achieving a precision of 95.83%, recall of 91.85%, F1-score of 93.48%, mAP@0.5
of 96.48%, and mAP@0.5:0.95 of 77.75%. Compared to previous YOLO-based methods,
our model demonstrates enhanced accuracy and efficiency.
  Conclusions: These results suggest that the proposed method is well-suited
for real-time colonoscopy support in clinical settings. Overall, the study
underscores how crucial data preprocessing and model efficiency are when
designing effective AI systems for medical imaging.

Motivation: 准确追踪管状树结构（如血管和气道）对医学任务至关重要，但现有模型存在重复分支和提前终止的问题。

Method: 提出Trexplorer Super模型，通过新方法改进性能，并开发了三个难度递增的数据集用于评估。

Result: Trexplorer Super在所有数据集上均优于现有SOTA模型，且合成数据表现不总能反映真实数据表现。

Conclusion: Trexplorer Super显著提升了中心线追踪性能，同时公开的数据集和代码为未来研究提供了支持。

Abstract: Tubular tree structures, such as blood vessels and airways, are essential in
human anatomy and accurately tracking them while preserving their topology is
crucial for various downstream tasks. Trexplorer is a recurrent model designed
for centerline tracking in 3D medical images but it struggles with predicting
duplicate branches and terminating tracking prematurely. To address these
issues, we present Trexplorer Super, an enhanced version that notably improves
performance through novel advancements. However, evaluating centerline tracking
models is challenging due to the lack of public datasets. To enable thorough
evaluation, we develop three centerline datasets, one synthetic and two real,
each with increasing difficulty. Using these datasets, we conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models and compare
them with our approach. Trexplorer Super outperforms previous SOTA models on
every dataset. Our results also highlight that strong performance on synthetic
data does not necessarily translate to real datasets. The code and datasets are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于Transformer的AI天气模型取得了显著进展，但其高复杂性和资源需求限制了实用性。因此，研究旨在开发一种更高效的CNN架构。

Method: 通过改进CNN架构，引入尺度不变设计和InceptionNeXt模块，结合地球系统数据特性，构建了KAI-a模型。

Result: KAI-a在中等范围天气预报中表现与最先进模型相当，且计算资源需求更低，能有效捕捉极端天气事件。

Conclusion: KAI-a为数据驱动的天气预报提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案，尤其适合资源受限的场景。

Abstract: Recently, AI-based weather forecast models have achieved impressive advances.
These models have reached accuracy levels comparable to traditional NWP
systems, marking a significant milestone in data-driven weather prediction.
However, they mostly leverage Transformer-based architectures, which often
leads to high training complexity and resource demands due to the massive
parameter sizes. In this study, we introduce a modernized CNN-based model for
global weather forecasting that delivers competitive accuracy while
significantly reducing computational requirements. To present a systematic
modernization roadmap, we highlight key architectural enhancements across
multiple design scales from an earlier CNN-based approach. KAI-a incorporates a
scale-invariant architecture and InceptionNeXt-based blocks within a
geophysically-aware design, tailored to the structure of Earth system data.
Trained on the ERA5 daily dataset with 67 atmospheric variables, the model
contains about 7 million parameters and completes training in just 12 hours on
a single NVIDIA L40s GPU. Our evaluation shows that KAI-a matches the
performance of state-of-the-art models in medium-range weather forecasting,
while offering a significantly lightweight design. Furthermore, case studies on
the 2018 European heatwave and the East Asian summer monsoon demonstrate
KAI-a's robust skill in capturing extreme events, reinforcing its practical

*Xiaocong Zeng,Craig Michoski,Yan Pang,Dongyang Kuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出两种新的正则化策略（LVL和LGCL）解决EEG情感识别中的时间尺度依赖标签不一致问题，并通过实验验证其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决EEG情感识别中时间尺度依赖标签不一致（TsDLI）问题，提升模型泛化性和可解释性。

Method: 提出Local Variation Loss (LVL)和Local-Global Consistency Loss (LGCL)两种正则化策略，结合数学原理和图论框架。

Result: 在DREAMER和DEAP数据集上，LVL和LGCL优于现有方法，LVL表现最佳。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在标签不一致情况下平衡了可解释性和预测能力，效果显著。

Abstract: In this work, we address the often-overlooked issue of Timescale Dependent
Label Inconsistency (TsDLI) in training neural network models for EEG-based
human emotion recognition. To mitigate TsDLI and enhance model generalization
and explainability, we propose two novel regularization strategies: Local
Variation Loss (LVL) and Local-Global Consistency Loss (LGCL). Both methods
incorporate classical mathematical principles--specifically, functions of
bounded variation and commute-time distances--within a graph theoretic
framework. Complementing our regularizers, we introduce a suite of new
evaluation metrics that better capture the alignment between temporally local
predictions and their associated global emotion labels. We validate our
approach through comprehensive experiments on two widely used EEG emotion
datasets, DREAMER and DEAP, across a range of neural architectures including
LSTM and transformer-based models. Performance is assessed using five distinct
metrics encompassing both quantitative accuracy and qualitative consistency.
Results consistently show that our proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art
baselines, delivering superior aggregate performance and offering a principled
trade-off between interpretability and predictive power under label
inconsistency. Notably, LVL achieves the best aggregate rank across all
benchmarked backbones and metrics, while LGCL frequently ranks the second,
highlighting the effectiveness of our framework.

*Shaowen Tong,Zimin Xia,Alexandre Alahi,Xuming He,Yujiao Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoDistill提出了一种几何引导的弱监督自蒸馏框架，通过教师-学生学习提升跨视角定位性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨视角定位方法依赖全监督学习，需要昂贵的姿态标注，GeoDistill旨在减少标注需求并提升性能。

Method: 采用教师-学生框架，教师模型定位全景图像，学生模型通过FoV掩码学习局部特征，对齐预测结果以优化特征学习。

Result: 实验表明GeoDistill显著提升定位性能，且适用于全景或有限FoV图像。

Conclusion: GeoDistill为跨视角定位提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-view localization, the task of estimating a camera's
3-degrees-of-freedom (3-DoF) pose by aligning ground-level images with
satellite images, is crucial for large-scale outdoor applications like
autonomous navigation and augmented reality. Existing methods often rely on
fully supervised learning, which requires costly ground-truth pose annotations.
In this work, we propose GeoDistill, a Geometry guided weakly supervised self
distillation framework that uses teacher-student learning with Field-of-View
(FoV)-based masking to enhance local feature learning for robust cross-view
localization. In GeoDistill, the teacher model localizes a panoramic image,
while the student model predicts locations from a limited FoV counterpart
created by FoV-based masking. By aligning the student's predictions with those
of the teacher, the student focuses on key features like lane lines and ignores
textureless regions, such as roads. This results in more accurate predictions
and reduced uncertainty, regardless of whether the query images are panoramas
or limited FoV images. Our experiments show that GeoDistill significantly
improves localization performance across different frameworks. Additionally, we
introduce a novel orientation estimation network that predicts relative
orientation without requiring precise planar position ground truth. GeoDistill
provides a scalable and efficient solution for real-world cross-view
localization challenges. Code and model can be found at

*Zhengyi Xu,Haoran Wu,Wen Jiang,Jie Geng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GAPL-SCD的图聚合原型学习方法，用于解决语义变化检测中的多任务优化问题，通过自适应权重分配和梯度旋转方法提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义变化检测（SCD）需要同时优化多个任务，容易因任务间冲突导致负迁移，因此需要一种方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出GAPL-SCD框架，结合多任务联合优化、图聚合原型学习、自适应权重分配和梯度旋转方法，增强多任务学习能力。

Result: 在SECOND和Landsat-SCD数据集上实现了最先进的性能，显著提升了SCD任务的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GAPL-SCD通过多任务优化和特征增强，有效解决了语义变化检测中的挑战，为复杂场景提供了高性能解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic change detection (SCD) extends the binary change detection task to
provide not only the change locations but also the detailed "from-to"
categories in multi-temporal remote sensing data. Such detailed semantic
insights into changes offer considerable advantages for a wide array of
applications. However, since SCD involves the simultaneous optimization of
multiple tasks, the model is prone to negative transfer due to task-specific
learning difficulties and conflicting gradient flows. To address this issue, we
propose Graph Aggregation Prototype Learning for Semantic Change Detection in
remote sensing(GAPL-SCD). In this framework, a multi-task joint optimization
method is designed to optimize the primary task of semantic segmentation and
change detection, along with the auxiliary task of graph aggregation prototype
learning. Adaptive weight allocation and gradient rotation methods are used to
alleviate the conflict between training tasks and improve multi-task learning
capabilities. Specifically, the graph aggregation prototype learning module
constructs an interaction graph using high-level features. Prototypes serve as
class proxies, enabling category-level domain alignment across time points and
reducing interference from irrelevant changes. Additionally, the proposed
self-query multi-level feature interaction and bi-temporal feature fusion
modules further enhance multi-scale feature representation, improving
performance in complex scenes. Experimental results on the SECOND and
Landsat-SCD datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with significant improvements in accuracy and robustness for SCD
task.

Motivation: 当前人脸修复方法在身份保真度上存在不足，尤其是面对身份模糊输入和随机生成过程时。

Method: RIDFR利用预训练扩散模型，结合内容注入和身份注入模块，并通过对齐学习抑制ID无关语义干扰。

Result: 实验表明，RIDFR在身份保真度和视觉质量上优于现有方法，表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RIDFR为ID特定人脸修复提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了身份保真度和视觉质量。

Abstract: The latest developments in Face Restoration have yielded significant
advancements in visual quality through the utilization of diverse diffusion
priors. Nevertheless, the uncertainty of face identity introduced by
identity-obscure inputs and stochastic generative processes remains unresolved.
To address this challenge, we present Robust ID-Specific Face Restoration
(RIDFR), a novel ID-specific face restoration framework based on diffusion
models. Specifically, RIDFR leverages a pre-trained diffusion model in
conjunction with two parallel conditioning modules. The Content Injection
Module inputs the severely degraded image, while the Identity Injection Module
integrates the specific identity from a given image. Subsequently, RIDFR
incorporates Alignment Learning, which aligns the restoration results from
multiple references with the same identity in order to suppress the
interference of ID-irrelevant face semantics (e.g. pose, expression, make-up,
hair style). Experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods, reconstructing high-quality ID-specific results with
high identity fidelity and demonstrating strong robustness.

Abstract: Sports action classification representing complex body postures and
player-object interactions is an emerging area in image-based sports analysis.
Some works have contributed to automated sports action recognition using
machine learning techniques over the past decades. However, sufficient image
datasets representing women sports actions with enough intra- and inter-class
variations are not available to the researchers. To overcome this limitation,
this work presents a new dataset named WomenSports for women sports
classification using small-scale training data. This dataset includes a variety
of sports activities, covering wide variations in movements, environments, and
interactions among players. In addition, this study proposes a convolutional
neural network (CNN) for deep feature extraction. A channel attention scheme
upon local contextual regions is applied to refine and enhance feature
representation. The experiments are carried out on three different sports
datasets and one dance dataset for generalizing the proposed algorithm, and the
performances on these datasets are noteworthy. The deep learning method
achieves 89.15% top-1 classification accuracy using ResNet-50 on the proposed
WomenSports dataset, which is publicly available for research at Mendeley Data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于小波注意力和射线编码器的新型HOI检测架构，解决了现有方法效率低和资源消耗大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HOI检测器在高效性和可靠性上存在不足，需要资源密集型训练和低效架构。

Method: 设计小波注意力主干和射线编码器，分别用于聚合多阶交互特征和优化多尺度注意力。

Result: 在ImageNet和HICO-DET等基准数据集上验证了架构的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的架构显著提升了HOI检测的效率和准确性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Human-object interaction (HOI) detection is essential for accurately
localizing and characterizing interactions between humans and objects,
providing a comprehensive understanding of complex visual scenes across various
domains. However, existing HOI detectors often struggle to deliver reliable
predictions efficiently, relying on resource-intensive training methods and
inefficient architectures. To address these challenges, we conceptualize a
wavelet attention-like backbone and a novel ray-based encoder architecture
tailored for HOI detection. Our wavelet backbone addresses the limitations of
expressing middle-order interactions by aggregating discriminative features
from the low- and high-order interactions extracted from diverse convolutional
filters. Concurrently, the ray-based encoder facilitates multi-scale attention
by optimizing the focus of the decoder on relevant regions of interest and
mitigating computational overhead. As a result of harnessing the attenuated
intensity of learnable ray origins, our decoder aligns query embeddings with
emphasized regions of interest for accurate predictions. Experimental results
on benchmark datasets, including ImageNet and HICO-DET, showcase the potential
of our proposed architecture. The code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前步态识别方法未解决遮挡问题，且现有方法需配对数据或无法兼顾完整步态识别。

Method: 将遮挡步态建模为完整步态表示的残差偏差，通过残差学习网络自适应整合残差。

Result: 在Gait3D、GREW和BRIAR数据集上验证了方法的有效性，显著提升遮挡步态识别性能且不影响完整步态识别。

Conclusion: 残差学习是解决遮挡步态识别并保留完整步态性能的有效技术。

Abstract: Gait is becoming popular as a method of person re-identification because of
its ability to identify people at a distance. However, most current works in
gait recognition do not address the practical problem of occlusions. Among
those which do, some require paired tuples of occluded and holistic sequences,
which are impractical to collect in the real world. Further, these approaches
work on occlusions but fail to retain performance on holistic inputs. To
address these challenges, we propose RG-Gait, a method for residual correction
for occluded gait recognition with holistic retention. We model the problem as
a residual learning task, conceptualizing the occluded gait signature as a
residual deviation from the holistic gait representation. Our proposed network
adaptively integrates the learned residual, significantly improving performance
on occluded gait sequences without compromising the holistic recognition
accuracy. We evaluate our approach on the challenging Gait3D, GREW and BRIAR
datasets and show that learning the residual can be an effective technique to
tackle occluded gait recognition with holistic retention.

TL;DR: SpaRTAN是一种轻量级架构设计，通过多尺度空间特征和通道聚合模块提升性能，在ImageNet和COCO上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CNN和Transformer在视觉任务中的简单性偏置和信息冗余问题。

Method: 采用多尺度核和波式通道聚合模块，高效捕获特征并减少冗余。

Result: ImageNet-1k上77.7%准确率（3.8M参数），COCO上50.0% AP（21.5M参数）。

Conclusion: SpaRTAN通过高效设计实现了高性能和参数效率。

Abstract: The resurgence of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in visual recognition
tasks, exemplified by ConvNeXt, has demonstrated their capability to rival
transformer-based architectures through advanced training methodologies and
ViT-inspired design principles. However, both CNNs and transformers exhibit a
simplicity bias, favoring straightforward features over complex structural
representations. Furthermore, modern CNNs often integrate MLP-like blocks akin
to those in transformers, but these blocks suffer from significant information
redundancies, necessitating high expansion ratios to sustain competitive
performance. To address these limitations, we propose SpaRTAN, a lightweight
architectural design that enhances spatial and channel-wise information
processing. SpaRTAN employs kernels with varying receptive fields, controlled
by kernel size and dilation factor, to capture discriminative multi-order
spatial features effectively. A wave-based channel aggregation module further
modulates and reinforces pixel interactions, mitigating channel-wise
redundancies. Combining the two modules, the proposed network can efficiently
gather and dynamically contextualize discriminative features. Experimental
results in ImageNet and COCO demonstrate that SpaRTAN achieves remarkable
parameter efficiency while maintaining competitive performance. In particular,
on the ImageNet-1k benchmark, SpaRTAN achieves 77. 7% accuracy with only 3.8M
parameters and approximately 1.0 GFLOPs, demonstrating its ability to deliver
strong performance through an efficient design. On the COCO benchmark, it
achieves 50.0% AP, surpassing the previous benchmark by 1.2% with only 21.5M
parameters. The code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零样本异常检测（ZSAD）在工业应用中需求广泛，但现有方法在性能和适应性上存在不足，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: FiSeCLIP结合特征匹配与跨模态对齐，利用批次内图像作为参考，通过文本信息过滤噪声，并恢复CLIP的局部语义相关性。

Result: 在MVTec-AD等基准测试中，FiSeCLIP在分割指标AU-ROC和F1-max上分别比SOTA方法AdaCLIP提升了4.6%和5.7%。

Conclusion: FiSeCLIP为ZSAD提供了更强大的基线方法，展示了CLIP在异常检测任务中的潜力。

Abstract: With the advent of vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) in zero- and few-shot
settings, CLIP has been widely applied to zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) in
recent research, where the rare classes are essential and expected in many
applications. This study introduces \textbf{FiSeCLIP} for ZSAD with
training-free \textbf{CLIP}, combining the feature matching with the
cross-modal alignment. Testing with the entire dataset is impractical, while
batch-based testing better aligns with real industrial needs, and images within
a batch can serve as mutual reference points. Accordingly, FiSeCLIP utilizes
other images in the same batch as reference information for the current image.
However, the lack of labels for these references can introduce ambiguity, we
apply text information to \textbf{fi}lter out noisy features. In addition, we
further explore CLIP's inherent potential to restore its local
\textbf{se}mantic correlation, adapting it for fine-grained anomaly detection
tasks to enable a more accurate filtering process. Our approach exhibits
superior performance for both anomaly classification and segmentation on
anomaly detection benchmarks, building a stronger baseline for the direction,
e.g., on MVTec-AD, FiSeCLIP outperforms the SOTA AdaCLIP by
+4.6\%$\uparrow$/+5.7\%$\uparrow$ in segmentation metrics AU-ROC/$F_1$-max.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法生成的放射学报告虽然流畅，但因数据偏差导致医学准确性不足，限制了临床应用。

Method: SISRNet通过细粒度跨模态语义识别医学关键区域，并在图像建模和报告生成中系统关注这些区域。

Result: SISRNet在IU-Xray和MIMIC-CXR数据集上表现优于同类方法。

Conclusion: SISRNet通过聚焦医学关键区域，有效提升了放射学报告的临床准确性。

Abstract: Recent advances in automated radiology report generation from chest X-rays
using deep learning algorithms have the potential to significantly reduce the
arduous workload of radiologists. However, due to the inherent massive data
bias in radiology images, where abnormalities are typically subtle and sparsely
distributed, existing methods often produce fluent yet medically inaccurate
reports, limiting their applicability in clinical practice. To address this
issue effectively, we propose a Semantically Informed Salient Regions-guided
(SISRNet) report generation method. Specifically, our approach explicitly
identifies salient regions with medically critical characteristics using
fine-grained cross-modal semantics. Then, SISRNet systematically focuses on
these high-information regions during both image modeling and report
generation, effectively capturing subtle abnormal findings, mitigating the
negative impact of data bias, and ultimately generating clinically accurate
reports. Compared to its peers, SISRNet demonstrates superior performance on
widely used IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR datasets.

<details>

Motivation: 解决传统GAN或扩散模型在医学图像翻译中边界一致性和临床偏好对齐的不足。

Method: 结合GAN先验和人类反馈（通过CFG），通过迭代优化和锦标赛选择内部化人类偏好。

Result: 在临床数据集上，RMSE、SSIM、LPIPS和Dice指标优于现有方法，仅需10步采样。

Conclusion: 该框架高效且有效，适用于实时医学图像翻译，满足临床偏好。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for CBCT-to-MDCT translation, grounded in the
Schrodinger Bridge (SB) formulation, which integrates GAN-derived priors with
human-guided conditional diffusion. Unlike conventional GANs or diffusion
models, our approach explicitly enforces boundary consistency between CBCT
inputs and pseudo targets, ensuring both anatomical fidelity and perceptual
controllability. Binary human feedback is incorporated via classifier-free
guidance (CFG), effectively steering the generative process toward clinically
preferred outcomes. Through iterative refinement and tournament-based
preference selection, the model internalizes human preferences without relying
on a reward model. Subtraction image visualizations reveal that the proposed
method selectively attenuates shade artifacts in key anatomical regions while
preserving fine structural detail. Quantitative evaluations further demonstrate
superior performance across RMSE, SSIM, LPIPS, and Dice metrics on clinical
datasets -- outperforming prior GAN- and fine-tuning-based feedback methods --
while requiring only 10 sampling steps. These findings underscore the
effectiveness and efficiency of our framework for real-time, preference-aligned
medical image translation.

Motivation: 解决开放词汇语义分割（OVSS）无法理解用户个性化文本（如“我的马克杯”）的问题，以识别特定用户感兴趣的区域。

Method: 提出了一种文本提示调优的插件方法，采用“负掩模提议”减少错误预测，并通过注入视觉嵌入丰富文本提示表示。

Result: 在FSS$^\text{per}$、CUB$^\text{per}$和ADE$^\text{per}$等新基准上验证了方法的优越性。

Conclusion: 该方法在提升个性化OVSS性能的同时，未影响原始OVSS的表现。

Abstract: While open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) can segment an image into
semantic regions based on arbitrarily given text descriptions even for classes
unseen during training, it fails to understand personal texts (e.g., `my mug
cup') for segmenting regions of specific interest to users. This paper
addresses challenges like recognizing `my mug cup' among `multiple mug cups'.
To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel task termed
\textit{personalized open-vocabulary semantic segmentation} and propose a text
prompt tuning-based plug-in method designed to recognize personal visual
concepts using a few pairs of images and masks, while maintaining the
performance of the original OVSS. Based on the observation that reducing false
predictions is essential when applying text prompt tuning to this task, our
proposed method employs `negative mask proposal' that captures visual concepts
other than the personalized concept. We further improve the performance by
enriching the representation of text prompts by injecting visual embeddings of
the personal concept into them. This approach enhances personalized OVSS
without compromising the original OVSS performance. We demonstrate the
superiority of our method on our newly established benchmarks for this task,
including FSS$^\text{per}$, CUB$^\text{per}$, and ADE$^\text{per}$.

Conclusion: DGFDNet通过双域框架和物理引导，实现了高效且高性能的去雾。

Abstract: Transformer-based models exhibit strong global modeling capabilities in
single-image dehazing, but their high computational cost limits real-time
applicability. Existing methods predominantly rely on spatial-domain features
to capture long-range dependencies, which are computationally expensive and
often inadequate under complex haze conditions. While some approaches introduce
frequency-domain cues, the weak coupling between spatial and frequency branches
limits the overall performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose the
Dark Channel Guided Frequency-aware Dehazing Network (DGFDNet), a novel
dual-domain framework that performs physically guided degradation alignment
across spatial and frequency domains. At its core, the DGFDBlock comprises two
key modules: 1) the Haze-Aware Frequency Modulator (HAFM), which generates a
pixel-level haze confidence map from dark channel priors to adaptively enhance
haze-relevant frequency components, thereby achieving global degradation-aware
spectral modulation; 2) the Multi-level Gating Aggregation Module (MGAM), which
fuses multi-scale features through diverse convolutional kernels and hybrid
gating mechanisms to recover fine structural details. Additionally, a Prior
Correction Guidance Branch (PCGB) incorporates a closed-loop feedback
mechanism, enabling iterative refinement of the prior by intermediate dehazed
features and significantly improving haze localization accuracy, especially in
challenging outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments on four benchmark haze
datasets demonstrate that DGFDNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with
superior robustness and real-time efficiency. Code is available at:

Abstract: The kinematics analysis of foot-ankle complex during gait is essential for
advancing biomechanical research and clinical assessment. Collecting accurate
surface geometry data from the foot and ankle during dynamic gait conditions is
inherently challenging due to swing foot occlusions and viewing limitations.
Thus, this paper introduces FootGait3D, a novel multi-view dataset of
high-resolution ankle-foot surface point clouds captured during natural gait.
Different from existing gait datasets that typically target whole-body or
lower-limb motion, FootGait3D focuses specifically on the detailed modeling of
the ankle-foot region, offering a finer granularity of motion data. To address
this, FootGait3D consists of 8,403 point cloud frames collected from 46
subjects using a custom five-camera depth sensing system. Each frame includes a
complete 5-view reconstruction of the foot and ankle (serving as ground truth)
along with partial point clouds obtained from only four, three, or two views.
This structured variation enables rigorous evaluation of 3D point cloud
completion methods under varying occlusion levels and viewpoints. Our dataset
is designed for shape completion tasks, facilitating the benchmarking of
state-of-the-art single-modal (e.g., PointTr, SnowflakeNet, Anchorformer) and
multi-modal (e.g., SVDFormer, PointSea, CSDN) completion networks on the
challenge of recovering the full foot geometry from occluded inputs. FootGait3D
has significant potential to advance research in biomechanics and multi-segment
foot modeling, offering a valuable testbed for clinical gait analysis,
prosthetic design, and robotics applications requiring detailed 3D models of
the foot during motion. The dataset is now available at

*Shuchang Ye,Usman Naseem,Mingyuan Meng,Jinman Kim*

TL;DR: ProLearn框架通过原型驱动的语义近似（PSA）模块，减少对文本输入的依赖，提升医学图像分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学语言引导的分割方法依赖成对的图像-文本输入，导致许多无文本的医学图像数据无法充分利用，且限制了临床应用。

Method: 提出ProLearn框架，引入PSA模块，通过原型空间和查询-响应机制，为无文本图像生成语义指导。

Result: 在QaTa-COV19、MosMedData+和Kvasir-SEG数据集上，ProLearn在文本有限时优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ProLearn有效减少了对文本的依赖，扩展了语言引导分割的适用性。

Abstract: Medical language-guided segmentation, integrating textual clinical reports as
auxiliary guidance to enhance image segmentation, has demonstrated significant
improvements over unimodal approaches. However, its inherent reliance on paired
image-text input, which we refer to as ``textual reliance", presents two
fundamental limitations: 1) many medical segmentation datasets lack paired
reports, leaving a substantial portion of image-only data underutilized for
training; and 2) inference is limited to retrospective analysis of cases with
paired reports, limiting its applicability in most clinical scenarios where
segmentation typically precedes reporting. To address these limitations, we
propose ProLearn, the first Prototype-driven Learning framework for
language-guided segmentation that fundamentally alleviates textual reliance. At
its core, in ProLearn, we introduce a novel Prototype-driven Semantic
Approximation (PSA) module to enable approximation of semantic guidance from
textual input. PSA initializes a discrete and compact prototype space by
distilling segmentation-relevant semantics from textual reports. Once
initialized, it supports a query-and-respond mechanism which approximates
semantic guidance for images without textual input, thereby alleviating textual
reliance. Extensive experiments on QaTa-COV19, MosMedData+ and Kvasir-SEG
demonstrate that ProLearn outperforms state-of-the-art language-guided methods
when limited text is available.

TL;DR: RoMaP是一种新的局部3D高斯编辑框架，通过3D-GALP模块和正则化SDS损失，实现了精确和大幅度的部分级3D编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D神经表示和实例级编辑模型在实现精确局部3D编辑方面存在挑战，尤其是高斯泼溅技术因多视角2D分割不一致和SDS损失的模糊性而受限。

Method: 提出3D-GALP模块用于生成鲁棒的3D掩码，并结合正则化SDS损失（包括L1锚定损失和额外正则化器）来优化编辑效果。

Result: RoMaP在重建和生成的高斯场景中实现了最先进的局部3D编辑效果，定性和定量表现均优异。

Conclusion: RoMaP为3D高斯编辑提供了更鲁棒和灵活的部分级编辑能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D neural representations and instance-level editing
models have enabled the efficient creation of high-quality 3D content. However,
achieving precise local 3D edits remains challenging, especially for Gaussian
Splatting, due to inconsistent multi-view 2D part segmentations and inherently
ambiguous nature of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss. To address these
limitations, we propose RoMaP, a novel local 3D Gaussian editing framework that
enables precise and drastic part-level modifications. First, we introduce a
robust 3D mask generation module with our 3D-Geometry Aware Label Prediction
(3D-GALP), which uses spherical harmonics (SH) coefficients to model
view-dependent label variations and soft-label property, yielding accurate and
consistent part segmentations across viewpoints. Second, we propose a
regularized SDS loss that combines the standard SDS loss with additional
regularizers. In particular, an L1 anchor loss is introduced via our Scheduled
Latent Mixing and Part (SLaMP) editing method, which generates high-quality
part-edited 2D images and confines modifications only to the target region
while preserving contextual coherence. Additional regularizers, such as
Gaussian prior removal, further improve flexibility by allowing changes beyond
the existing context, and robust 3D masking prevents unintended edits.
Experimental results demonstrate that our RoMaP achieves state-of-the-art local
3D editing on both reconstructed and generated Gaussian scenes and objects
qualitatively and quantitatively, making it possible for more robust and
flexible part-level 3D Gaussian editing.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于关节角度的新方法，用于改进无标记人体姿态估计（HPE），解决了关键点识别错误和轨迹波动问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HPE方法在关键点识别和轨迹分析中存在误差，且训练数据标注不准确限制了深度学习模型的性能。

Method: 通过关节角度建模、高阶傅里叶级数近似关节角度变化，以及设计双向循环网络作为后处理模块。

Result: 在花样滑冰和街舞等挑战性案例中，JAR方法优于现有HPE改进网络。

Conclusion: 基于关节角度的改进方法显著提升了HPE的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Marker-free human pose estimation (HPE) has found increasing applications in
various fields. Current HPE suffers from occasional errors in keypoint
recognition and random fluctuation in keypoint trajectories when analyzing
kinematic human poses. The performance of existing deep learning-based models
for HPE refinement is considerably limited by inaccurate training datasets in
which the keypoints are manually annotated. This paper proposed a novel method
to overcome the difficulty through joint angle-based modeling. The key
techniques include: (i) A joint angle-based model of human pose, which is
robust to describe kinematic human poses; (ii) Approximating temporal variation
of joint angles through high order Fourier series to get reliable "ground
truth"; (iii) A bidirectional recurrent network is designed as a
post-processing module to refine the estimation of well-established HRNet.
Trained with the high-quality dataset constructed using our method, the network
demonstrates outstanding performance to correct wrongly recognized joints and
smooth their spatiotemporal trajectories. Tests show that joint angle-based
refinement (JAR) outperforms the state-of-the-art HPE refinement network in
challenging cases like figure skating and breaking.

Result: 实验表明GKNet在精度和有效性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GKNet在非合作航天器姿态估计中表现出高精度和鲁棒性，SKD数据集为未来研究提供了支持。

Abstract: Monocular pose estimation of non-cooperative spacecraft is significant for
on-orbit service (OOS) tasks, such as satellite maintenance, space debris
removal, and station assembly. Considering the high demands on pose estimation
accuracy, mainstream monocular pose estimation methods typically consist of
keypoint detectors and PnP solver. However, current keypoint detectors remain
vulnerable to structural symmetry and partial occlusion of non-cooperative
spacecraft. To this end, we propose a graph-based keypoints network for the
monocular pose estimation of non-cooperative spacecraft, GKNet, which leverages
the geometric constraint of keypoints graph. In order to better validate
keypoint detectors, we present a moderate-scale dataset for the spacecraft
keypoint detection, named SKD, which consists of 3 spacecraft targets, 90,000
simulated images, and corresponding high-precise keypoint annotations.
Extensive experiments and an ablation study have demonstrated the high accuracy
and effectiveness of our GKNet, compared to the state-of-the-art spacecraft
keypoint detectors. The code for GKNet and the SKD dataset is available at

Result: 在实地测试中召回率超过98.6%，检测系统可减少约90%的人工工作量。

Conclusion: 该方法为RSD自动识别提供了高效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Ground penetrating radar (GPR) has become a rapid and non-destructive
solution for road subsurface distress (RSD) detection. However, RSD recognition
from GPR images is labor-intensive and heavily relies on inspectors' expertise.
Deep learning offers the possibility for automatic RSD recognition, but its
current performance is limited by two factors: Scarcity of high-quality dataset
for network training and insufficient capability of network to distinguish RSD.
In this study, a rigorously validated 3D GPR dataset containing 2134 samples of
diverse types was constructed through field scanning. Based on the finding that
the YOLO model trained with one of the three scans of GPR images exhibits
varying sensitivity to specific type of RSD, we proposed a novel
cross-verification strategy with outstanding accuracy in RSD recognition,
achieving recall over 98.6% in field tests. The approach, integrated into an
online RSD detection system, can reduce the labor of inspection by around 90%.

Result: 在Atmos-Bench数据集上，FourCastX在355 nm和532 nm波段均优于现有基线模型。

Conclusion: Atmos-Bench为卫星3D大气结构恢复设定了新标准，有助于更深入的气候研究。

Abstract: Atmospheric structure, represented by backscatter coefficients (BC) recovered
from satellite LiDAR attenuated backscatter (ATB), provides a volumetric view
of clouds, aerosols, and molecules, playing a critical role in human
activities, climate understanding, and extreme weather forecasting. Existing
methods often rely on auxiliary inputs and simplified physics-based
approximations, and lack a standardized 3D benchmark for fair evaluation.
However, such approaches may introduce additional uncertainties and
insufficiently capture realistic radiative transfer and atmospheric
scattering-absorption effects. To bridge these gaps, we present Atmos-Bench:
the first 3D atmospheric benchmark, along with a novel FourCastX:
Frequency-enhanced Spatio-Temporal Mixture-of-Experts Network that (a)
generates 921,600 image slices from 3D scattering volumes simulated at 532 nm
and 355 nm by coupling WRF with an enhanced COSP simulator over 384 land-ocean
time steps, yielding high-quality voxel-wise references; (b) embeds ATB-BC
physical constraints into the model architecture, promoting energy consistency
during restoration; (c) achieves consistent improvements on the Atmos-Bench
dataset across both 355 nm and 532 nm bands, outperforming state-of-the-art
baseline models without relying on auxiliary inputs. Atmos-Bench establishes a
new standard for satellite-based 3D atmospheric structure recovery and paves
the way for deeper climate insight.

Abstract: In recent years, visual recognition methods have advanced significantly,
finding applications across diverse fields. While researchers seek to
understand the mechanisms behind the success of these models, there is also a
growing impetus to deploy them in critical areas like autonomous driving and
medical diagnostics to better diagnose failures, which promotes the development
of interpretability research. This paper systematically reviews existing
research on the interpretability of visual recognition models and proposes a
taxonomy of methods from a human-centered perspective. The proposed taxonomy
categorizes interpretable recognition methods based on Intent, Object,
Presentation, and Methodology, thereby establishing a systematic and coherent
set of grouping criteria for these XAI methods. Additionally, we summarize the
requirements for evaluation metrics and explore new opportunities enabled by
recent technologies, such as large multimodal models. We aim to organize
existing research in this domain and inspire future investigations into the
interpretability of visual recognition models.

Conclusion: KptLLM++为细粒度图像理解提供了统一解决方案，并推动了人机交互的变革。

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has revolutionized
image understanding by bridging textual and visual modalities. However, these
models often struggle with capturing fine-grained semantic information, such as
the precise identification and analysis of object keypoints. Keypoints, as
structure-aware, pixel-level, and compact representations of objects,
particularly articulated ones, play a crucial role in applications such as
fine-grained image analysis, object retrieval, and behavior recognition. In
this paper, we propose KptLLM++, a novel multimodal large language model that
specifically designed for generic keypoint comprehension through the
integration of diverse input modalities guided by user-defined instructions. By
unifying keypoint detection across varied contexts, KptLLM++ establishes itself
as an advanced interface, fostering more effective human-AI collaboration. The
model is built upon a novel identify-then-detect paradigm, which first
interprets keypoint semantics and subsequently localizes their precise
positions through a structured chain-of-thought reasoning mechanism. To push
the boundaries of performance, we have scaled up the training dataset to over
500K samples, encompassing diverse objects, keypoint categories, image styles,
and scenarios with complex occlusions. This extensive scaling enables KptLLM++
to unlock its potential, achieving remarkable accuracy and generalization.
Comprehensive experiments on multiple keypoint detection benchmarks demonstrate
its state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its potential as a unified
solution for fine-grained image understanding and its transformative
implications for human-AI interaction.

Motivation: 硬样本在行人重识别任务中具有挑战性，尤其是在服装变化的场景下，其模糊性和相似性限制了模型的设计和鲁棒性。

Method: HSGL框架包括双粒度硬样本生成（DGHSG）和硬样本自适应学习（HSAL），前者利用多模态线索生成语义一致的硬样本，后者通过硬度感知优化策略调整特征距离。

Conclusion: 多模态引导的硬样本生成与学习为CC-ReID提供了有效的解决方案，提升了模型的判别能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Hard samples pose a significant challenge in person re-identification (ReID)
tasks, particularly in clothing-changing person Re-ID (CC-ReID). Their inherent
ambiguity or similarity, coupled with the lack of explicit definitions, makes
them a fundamental bottleneck. These issues not only limit the design of
targeted learning strategies but also diminish the model's robustness under
clothing or viewpoint changes. In this paper, we propose a novel
multimodal-guided Hard Sample Generation and Learning (HSGL) framework, which
is the first effort to unify textual and visual modalities to explicitly
define, generate, and optimize hard samples within a unified paradigm. HSGL
comprises two core components: (1) Dual-Granularity Hard Sample Generation
(DGHSG), which leverages multimodal cues to synthesize semantically consistent
samples, including both coarse- and fine-grained hard positives and negatives
for effectively increasing the hardness and diversity of the training data. (2)
Hard Sample Adaptive Learning (HSAL), which introduces a hardness-aware
optimization strategy that adjusts feature distances based on textual semantic
labels, encouraging the separation of hard positives and drawing hard negatives
closer in the embedding space to enhance the model's discriminative capability
and robustness to hard samples. Extensive experiments on multiple CC-ReID
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the
potential of multimodal-guided hard sample generation and learning for robust
CC-ReID. Notably, HSAL significantly accelerates the convergence of the
targeted learning procedure and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
PRCC and LTCC datasets. The code is available at

Conclusion: MMOne框架有效解决了多模态场景表示中的模态冲突问题，为多模态学习提供了紧凑高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Humans perceive the world through multimodal cues to understand and interact
with the environment. Learning a scene representation for multiple modalities
enhances comprehension of the physical world. However, modality conflicts,
arising from inherent distinctions among different modalities, present two
critical challenges: property disparity and granularity disparity. To address
these challenges, we propose a general framework, MMOne, to represent multiple
modalities in one scene, which can be readily extended to additional
modalities. Specifically, a modality modeling module with a novel modality
indicator is proposed to capture the unique properties of each modality.
Additionally, we design a multimodal decomposition mechanism to separate
multi-modal Gaussians into single-modal Gaussians based on modality
differences. We address the essential distinctions among modalities by
disentangling multimodal information into shared and modality-specific
components, resulting in a more compact and efficient multimodal scene
representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently
enhances the representation capability for each modality and is scalable to
additional modalities. The code is available at

Abstract: In recent years, landslide disasters have reported frequently due to the
extreme weather events of droughts, floods , storms, or the consequence of
human activities such as deforestation, excessive exploitation of natural
resources. However, automatically observing landslide is challenging due to the
extremely large observing area and the rugged topography such as mountain or
highland. This motivates us to propose an end-to-end deep-learning-based model
which explores the remote sensing images for automatically observing landslide
events. By considering remote sensing images as the input data, we can obtain
free resource, observe large and rough terrains by time. To explore the remote
sensing images, we proposed a novel neural network architecture which is for
two tasks of landslide detection and landslide segmentation. We evaluated our
proposed model on three different benchmark datasets of LandSlide4Sense, Bijie,
and Nepal. By conducting extensive experiments, we achieve F1 scores of 98.23,
93.83 for the landslide detection task on LandSlide4Sense, Bijie datasets; mIoU
scores of 63.74, 76.88 on the segmentation tasks regarding LandSlide4Sense,

Abstract: Citrus, as one of the most economically important fruit crops globally,
suffers severe yield depressions due to various diseases. Accurate disease
detection and classification serve as critical prerequisites for implementing
targeted control measures. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence,
particularly deep learning-based computer vision algorithms, have substantially
decreased time and labor requirements while maintaining the accuracy of
detection and classification. Nevertheless, these methods predominantly rely on
massive, high-quality annotated training examples to attain promising
performance. By introducing two key designs: contrasting with cluster centroids
and a multi-layer contrastive training (MCT) paradigm, this paper proposes a
novel clustering-guided self-supervised multi-layer contrastive representation
learning (CMCRL) algorithm. The proposed method demonstrates several advantages
over existing counterparts: (1) optimizing with massive unannotated samples;
(2) effective adaptation to the symptom similarity across distinct citrus
diseases; (3) hierarchical feature representation learning. The proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the public citrus image set CDD,
outperforming existing methods by 4.5\%-30.1\% accuracy. Remarkably, our method
narrows the performance gap with fully supervised counterparts (all samples are
labeled). Beyond classification accuracy, our method shows great performance on
other evaluation metrics (F1 score, precision, and recall), highlighting the
robustness against the class imbalance challenge.

competence in medical tasks remains underexplored. We present a comprehensive
evaluation of open-source general-purpose and medically specialised VLMs,
ranging from 3B to 72B parameters, across eight benchmarks: MedXpert,
OmniMedVQA, PMC-VQA, PathVQA, MMMU, SLAKE, and VQA-RAD. To observe model
performance across different aspects, we first separate it into understanding
and reasoning components. Three salient findings emerge. First, large
general-purpose models already match or surpass medical-specific counterparts
on several benchmarks, demonstrating strong zero-shot transfer from natural to
medical images. Second, reasoning performance is consistently lower than
understanding, highlighting a critical barrier to safe decision support. Third,
performance varies widely across benchmarks, reflecting differences in task
design, annotation quality, and knowledge demands. No model yet reaches the
reliability threshold for clinical deployment, underscoring the need for
stronger multimodal alignment and more rigorous, fine-grained evaluation
protocols.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MCULoRA的新方法，通过解耦模态组合的共享信息和动态调整训练比例，解决了多模态情感识别中模态不完整的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际应用中多模态数据常因传感器故障或隐私保护而不完整，现有方法因训练梯度冲突导致性能下降。

Method: MCULoRA包含两个模块：MCLA（解耦模态组合的共享信息）和DPFT（动态调整训练比例）。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，MCULoRA显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MCULoRA为不完整多模态学习提供了一种高效的参数训练框架。

Abstract: Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) often encounters incomplete
multimodality in practical applications due to sensor failures or privacy
protection requirements. While existing methods attempt to address various
incomplete multimodal scenarios by balancing the training of each modality
combination through additional gradients, these approaches face a critical
limitation: training gradients from different modality combinations conflict
with each other, ultimately degrading the performance of the final prediction
model. In this paper, we propose a unimodal decoupled dynamic low-rank
adaptation method based on modality combinations, named MCULoRA, which is a
novel framework for the parameter-efficient training of incomplete multimodal
learning models. MCULoRA consists of two key modules, modality combination
aware low-rank adaptation (MCLA) and dynamic parameter fine-tuning (DPFT). The
MCLA module effectively decouples the shared information from the distinct
characteristics of individual modality combinations. The DPFT module adjusts
the training ratio of modality combinations based on the separability of each
modality's representation space, optimizing the learning efficiency across
different modality combinations. Our extensive experimental evaluation in
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrates that MCULoRA substantially outperforms
previous incomplete multimodal learning approaches in downstream task accuracy.

<details>

Motivation: 当前长视频生成模型的评估缺乏专门针对叙事表达能力的基准，现有基准（如VBench）仅支持简单叙事提示。

Method: 引入TNA作为基本叙事单元，设计自动提示生成管道，并基于MLLM框架设计评估指标。

Result: 实验表明，NarrLV的评估指标与人类判断高度一致，揭示了当前视频生成模型在叙事表达上的能力边界。

Conclusion: NarrLV为长视频生成模型的叙事表达能力提供了首个全面评估基准，填补了研究空白。

Abstract: With the rapid development of foundation video generation technologies, long
video generation models have exhibited promising research potential thanks to
expanded content creation space. Recent studies reveal that the goal of long
video generation tasks is not only to extend video duration but also to
accurately express richer narrative content within longer videos. However, due
to the lack of evaluation benchmarks specifically designed for long video
generation models, the current assessment of these models primarily relies on
benchmarks with simple narrative prompts (e.g., VBench). To the best of our
knowledge, our proposed NarrLV is the first benchmark to comprehensively
evaluate the Narrative expression capabilities of Long Video generation models.
Inspired by film narrative theory, (i) we first introduce the basic narrative
unit maintaining continuous visual presentation in videos as Temporal Narrative
Atom (TNA), and use its count to quantitatively measure narrative richness.
Guided by three key film narrative elements influencing TNA changes, we
construct an automatic prompt generation pipeline capable of producing
evaluation prompts with a flexibly expandable number of TNAs. (ii) Then, based
on the three progressive levels of narrative content expression, we design an
effective evaluation metric using the MLLM-based question generation and
answering framework. (iii) Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations on
existing long video generation models and the foundation generation models.
Experimental results demonstrate that our metric aligns closely with human
judgments. The derived evaluation outcomes reveal the detailed capability
boundaries of current video generation models in narrative content expression.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统公平性评估方法在连续敏感属性（如肤色）上可能忽略少数群体的歧视问题，需要更精细的分组方法。

Method: 提出基于歧视水平的公平性分组方法，最大化组间歧视差异，并应用于单调公平性场景。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能更精确地识别歧视模式，还能用于去偏处理，为工业应用提供了可行性。

Abstract: Within a legal framework, fairness in datasets and models is typically
assessed by dividing observations into predefined groups and then computing
fairness measures (e.g., Disparate Impact or Equality of Odds with respect to
gender). However, when sensitive attributes such as skin color are continuous,
dividing into default groups may overlook or obscure the discrimination
experienced by certain minority subpopulations. To address this limitation, we
propose a fairness-based grouping approach for continuous (possibly
multidimensional) sensitive attributes. By grouping data according to observed
levels of discrimination, our method identifies the partition that maximizes a
novel criterion based on inter-group variance in discrimination, thereby
isolating the most critical subgroups.
  We validate the proposed approach using multiple synthetic datasets and
demonstrate its robustness under changing population distributions - revealing
how discrimination is manifested within the space of sensitive attributes.
Furthermore, we examine a specialized setting of monotonic fairness for the
case of skin color. Our empirical results on both CelebA and FFHQ, leveraging
the skin tone as predicted by an industrial proprietary algorithm, show that
the proposed segmentation uncovers more nuanced patterns of discrimination than
previously reported, and that these findings remain stable across datasets for
a given model. Finally, we leverage our grouping model for debiasing purpose,
aiming at predicting fair scores with group-by-group post-processing. The
results demonstrate that our approach improves fairness while having minimal
impact on accuracy, thus confirming our partition method and opening the door
for industrial deployment.

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够生成高质量的烟雾图像，解决了数据稀缺问题，并提升了烟雾检测的准确性。

Abstract: Smoke is the first visible indicator of a wildfire.With the advancement of
deep learning, image-based smoke detection has become a crucial method for
detecting and preventing forest fires. However, the scarcity of smoke image
data from forest fires is one of the significant factors hindering the
detection of forest fire smoke. Image generation models offer a promising
solution for synthesizing realistic smoke images. However, current inpainting
models exhibit limitations in generating high-quality smoke representations,
particularly manifesting as inconsistencies between synthesized smoke and
background contexts. To solve these problems, we proposed a comprehensive
framework for generating forest fire smoke images. Firstly, we employed the
pre-trained segmentation model and the multimodal model to obtain smoke masks
and image captions.Then, to address the insufficient utilization of masks and
masked images by inpainting models, we introduced a network architecture guided
by mask and masked image features. We also proposed a new loss function, the
mask random difference loss, which enhances the consistency of the generated
effects around the mask by randomly expanding and eroding the mask
edges.Finally, to generate a smoke image dataset using random masks for
subsequent detection tasks, we incorporated smoke characteristics and use a
multimodal large language model as a filtering tool to select diverse and
reasonable smoke images, thereby improving the quality of the synthetic
dataset. Experiments showed that our generated smoke images are realistic and
diverse, and effectively enhance the performance of forest fire smoke detection
models. Code is available at https://github.com/wghr123/MFGDiffusion.

Result: 在3D视觉定位数据集上表现优异，尤其在需要精确空间区分的复杂查询中。

Conclusion: ViewSRD通过结构化多视角分解有效提升了3D视觉定位的性能。

Abstract: 3D visual grounding aims to identify and localize objects in a 3D space based
on textual descriptions. However, existing methods struggle with disentangling
targets from anchors in complex multi-anchor queries and resolving
inconsistencies in spatial descriptions caused by perspective variations. To
tackle these challenges, we propose ViewSRD, a framework that formulates 3D
visual grounding as a structured multi-view decomposition process. First, the
Simple Relation Decoupling (SRD) module restructures complex multi-anchor
queries into a set of targeted single-anchor statements, generating a
structured set of perspective-aware descriptions that clarify positional
relationships. These decomposed representations serve as the foundation for the
Multi-view Textual-Scene Interaction (Multi-TSI) module, which integrates
textual and scene features across multiple viewpoints using shared, Cross-modal
Consistent View Tokens (CCVTs) to preserve spatial correlations. Finally, a
Textual-Scene Reasoning module synthesizes multi-view predictions into a
unified and robust 3D visual grounding. Experiments on 3D visual grounding
datasets show that ViewSRD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
particularly in complex queries requiring precise spatial differentiation.

Conclusion: YOLOatr在热红外目标识别领域实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Automatic Target Detection (ATD) and Recognition (ATR) from Thermal Infrared
(TI) imagery in the defense and surveillance domain is a challenging computer
vision (CV) task in comparison to the commercial autonomous vehicle perception
domain. Limited datasets, peculiar domain-specific and TI modality-specific
challenges, i.e., limited hardware, scale invariance issues due to greater
distances, deliberate occlusion by tactical vehicles, lower sensor resolution
and resultant lack of structural information in targets, effects of weather,
temperature, and time of day variations, and varying target to clutter ratios
all result in increased intra-class variability and higher inter-class
similarity, making accurate real-time ATR a challenging CV task. Resultantly,
contemporary state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning architectures underperform
in the ATR domain. We propose a modified anchor-based single-stage detector,
called YOLOatr, based on a modified YOLOv5s, with optimal modifications to the
detection heads, feature fusion in the neck, and a custom augmentation profile.
We evaluate the performance of our proposed model on a comprehensive DSIAC MWIR
dataset for real-time ATR over both correlated and decorrelated testing
protocols. The results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves
state-of-the-art ATR performance of up to 99.6%.

images that capture 12 different plant poses from four camera elevation angles.
Each image includes manually annotated bounding boxes for seven regions of
interest (ROIs), including leaves, panicle, batch of flowers, batch of fruits,
axillary shoot, shoot and whole plant area, along with 50 fine-grained growth
stage classifications based on the BBCH scale. Additionally, we provide 3,616
high-resolution image subset with pixel-wise semantic and instance segmentation
annotations for fine-grained phenotyping. We validated our dataset using a
cascading model deep learning framework combining MobileNetv3 for
classification, YOLOv11 for object detection, and MaskRCNN for segmentation.
Through AI vs. Human analysis involving five domain experts, we demonstrate
that the models trained on our dataset achieve accuracy and speed comparable to

Abstract: In this paper, we study task-oriented human grasp synthesis, a new grasp
synthesis task that demands both task and context awareness. At the core of our
method is the task-aware contact maps. Unlike traditional contact maps that
only reason about the manipulated object and its relation with the hand, our
enhanced maps take into account scene and task information. This comprehensive
map is critical for hand-object interaction, enabling accurate grasping poses
that align with the task. We propose a two-stage pipeline that first constructs
a task-aware contact map informed by the scene and task. In the subsequent
stage, we use this contact map to synthesize task-oriented human grasps. We
introduce a new dataset and a metric for the proposed task to evaluate our
approach. Our experiments validate the importance of modeling both scene and
task, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods in both
grasp quality and task performance. See our project page for more details:

Abstract: Fluvial erosion is a natural process that can generate significant impacts on
soil stability and strategic infrastructures. The detection and monitoring of
this phenomenon is traditionally addressed by photogrammetric methods and
analysis in geographic information systems. These tasks require specific
knowledge and intensive manual processing. This study proposes an artificial
intelligence-based approach for automatic identification of eroded zones and
estimation of their area. The state-of-the-art computer vision model YOLOv11,
adjusted by fine-tuning and trained with photographs and LiDAR images, is used.
This combined dataset was segmented and labeled using the Roboflow platform.
Experimental results indicate efficient detection of erosion patterns with an
accuracy of 70%, precise identification of eroded areas and reliable
calculation of their extent in pixels and square meters. As a final product,
the EROSCAN system has been developed, an interactive web application that
allows users to upload images and obtain automatic segmentations of fluvial
erosion, together with the estimated area. This tool optimizes the detection
and quantification of the phenomenon, facilitating decision making in risk
management and territorial planning.

Abstract: Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has received a lot of attention in surface
reconstruction. However, while 3D objects can be of complex and diverse shapes
in the real world, existing GS-based methods only limitedly use a single type
of splatting primitive (Gaussian ellipse or Gaussian ellipsoid) to represent
object surfaces during their reconstruction. In this paper, we highlight that
this can be insufficient for object surfaces to be represented in high quality.
Thus, we propose a novel framework that, for the first time, enables Gaussian
Splatting to incorporate multiple types of (geometrical) primitives during its
surface reconstruction process. Specifically, in our framework, we first
propose a compositional splatting strategy, enabling the splatting and
rendering of different types of primitives in the Gaussian Splatting pipeline.
In addition, we also design our framework with a mixed-primitive-based
initialization strategy and a vertex pruning mechanism to further promote its
surface representation learning process to be well executed leveraging
different types of primitives. Extensive experiments show the efficacy of our
framework and its accurate surface reconstruction performance.

Result: 在DTU和Tanks-and-Temples数据集上达到最优性能，排名第一。

Conclusion: MonoMVSNet通过结合单目和多视角信息，显著提升了MVS在挑战区域的性能。

Abstract: Learning-based Multi-View Stereo (MVS) methods aim to predict depth maps for
a sequence of calibrated images to recover dense point clouds. However,
existing MVS methods often struggle with challenging regions, such as
textureless regions and reflective surfaces, where feature matching fails. In
contrast, monocular depth estimation inherently does not require feature
matching, allowing it to achieve robust relative depth estimation in these
regions. To bridge this gap, we propose MonoMVSNet, a novel monocular feature
and depth guided MVS network that integrates powerful priors from a monocular
foundation model into multi-view geometry. Firstly, the monocular feature of
the reference view is integrated into source view features by the attention
mechanism with a newly designed cross-view position encoding. Then, the
monocular depth of the reference view is aligned to dynamically update the
depth candidates for edge regions during the sampling procedure. Finally, a
relative consistency loss is further designed based on the monocular depth to
supervise the depth prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MonoMVSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DTU and
Tanks-and-Temples datasets, ranking first on the Tanks-and-Temples Intermediate
and Advanced benchmarks. The source code is available at

Abstract: Real-world user-generated videos, especially on platforms like TikTok, often
feature rich and intertwined audio visual content. However, existing video
captioning benchmarks and models remain predominantly visual centric,
overlooking the crucial role of audio in conveying scene dynamics, speaker
intent, and narrative context. This lack of omni datasets and lightweight,
capable models hampers progress in fine grained, multimodal video
understanding. To address these challenges, we introduce UGC-VideoCap, a new
benchmark and model framework specifically designed for detailed omnimodal
captioning of short form user-generated videos. Unlike prior datasets,
UGC-VideoCap emphasizes balanced integration of audio and visual modalities,
featuring 1000 TikTok videos annotated through a structured three stage
human-in-the-loop pipeline covering audio only, visual only, and joint audio
visual semantics. The benchmark also includes 4000 carefully crafted QA pairs
probing both unimodal and cross modal understanding. Alongside the dataset, we
propose UGC-VideoCaptioner(3B), a 3B parameter captioning model distilled from
Gemini 2.5 Flash. Using a novel two-stage training strategy supervised fine
tuning followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), our approach
enables efficient adaptation from limited data while maintaining competitive
performance. Together, our benchmark and model offer a high-quality foundation
and a data-efficient solution for advancing omnimodal video captioning in
unconstrained real-world UGC settings.

Abstract: Face Recognition (FR) tasks have made significant progress with the advent of
Deep Neural Networks, particularly through margin-based triplet losses that
embed facial images into high-dimensional feature spaces. During training,
these contrastive losses focus exclusively on identity information as labels.
However, we observe a multiscale geometric structure emerging in the embedding
space, influenced by interpretable facial (e.g., hair color) and image
attributes (e.g., contrast). We propose a geometric approach to describe the
dependence or invariance of FR models to these attributes and introduce a
physics-inspired alignment metric. We evaluate the proposed metric on
controlled, simplified models and widely used FR models fine-tuned with
synthetic data for targeted attribute augmentation. Our findings reveal that
the models exhibit varying degrees of invariance across different attributes,
providing insight into their strengths and weaknesses and enabling deeper
interpretability. Code available here:

Abstract: Vision AutoRegressive model (VAR) was recently introduced as an alternative
to Diffusion Models (DMs) in image generation domain. In this work we focus on
its adaptations, which aim to fine-tune pre-trained models to perform specific
downstream tasks, like medical data generation. While for DMs there exist many
techniques, adaptations for VAR remain underexplored. Similarly, differentially
private (DP) adaptations-ones that aim to preserve privacy of the adaptation
data-have been extensively studied for DMs, while VAR lacks such solutions. In
our work, we implement and benchmark many strategies for VAR, and compare them
to state-of-the-art DM adaptation strategies. We observe that VAR outperforms
DMs for non-DP adaptations, however, the performance of DP suffers, which
necessitates further research in private adaptations for VAR. Code is available

Method: 引入COLI框架，采用预训练-微调范式、混合精度训练和并行化目标加速收敛；提出超压缩技术提升压缩比。

Result: 在两个医学影像数据集上，COLI在PSNR和SSIM指标上表现优异，压缩比显著提升，训练速度提高4倍。

Conclusion: COLI为大型图像压缩提供了高效、高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: The escalating adoption of high-resolution, large-field-of-view imagery
amplifies the need for efficient compression methodologies. Conventional
techniques frequently fail to preserve critical image details, while
data-driven approaches exhibit limited generalizability. Implicit Neural
Representations (INRs) present a promising alternative by learning continuous
mappings from spatial coordinates to pixel intensities for individual images,
thereby storing network weights rather than raw pixels and avoiding the
generalization problem. However, INR-based compression of large images faces
challenges including slow compression speed and suboptimal compression ratios.
To address these limitations, we introduce COLI (Compressor for Large Images),
a novel framework leveraging Neural Representations for Videos (NeRV). First,
recognizing that INR-based compression constitutes a training process, we
accelerate its convergence through a pretraining-finetuning paradigm,
mixed-precision training, and reformulation of the sequential loss into a
parallelizable objective. Second, capitalizing on INRs' transformation of image
storage constraints into weight storage, we implement Hyper-Compression, a
novel post-training technique to substantially enhance compression ratios while
maintaining minimal output distortion. Evaluations across two medical imaging
datasets demonstrate that COLI consistently achieves competitive or superior
PSNR and SSIM metrics at significantly reduced bits per pixel (bpp), while
accelerating NeRV training by up to 4 times.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统统计形状建模方法依赖线性假设，难以表达复杂血管拓扑结构，因此需要一种更灵活且高保真的建模方法。

Method: HUG-VAS结合NURBS表面参数化和扩散生成模型，采用分层架构（中心线去噪扩散模型和径向轮廓引导扩散模型）生成血管几何。

Result: 模型在21个患者样本上训练，生成的主动脉结构及其生物标志物分布与原始数据集高度匹配。

Conclusion: HUG-VAS首次通过NURBS参数化和分层扩散过程，将图像先验与生成形状建模统一结合，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate characterization of vascular geometry is essential for
cardiovascular diagnosis and treatment planning. Traditional statistical shape
modeling (SSM) methods rely on linear assumptions, limiting their expressivity
and scalability to complex topologies such as multi-branch vascular structures.
We introduce HUG-VAS, a Hierarchical NURBS Generative model for Vascular
geometry Synthesis, which integrates NURBS surface parameterization with
diffusion-based generative modeling to synthesize realistic, fine-grained
aortic geometries. Trained with 21 patient-specific samples, HUG-VAS generates
anatomically faithful aortas with supra-aortic branches, yielding biomarker
distributions that closely match those of the original dataset. HUG-VAS adopts
a hierarchical architecture comprising a denoising diffusion model that
generates centerlines and a guided diffusion model that synthesizes radial
profiles conditioned on those centerlines, thereby capturing two layers of
anatomical variability. Critically, the framework supports zero-shot
conditional generation from image-derived priors, enabling practical
applications such as interactive semi-automatic segmentation, robust
reconstruction under degraded imaging conditions, and implantable device
optimization. To our knowledge, HUG-VAS is the first SSM framework to bridge
image-derived priors with generative shape modeling via a unified integration
of NURBS parameterization and hierarchical diffusion processes.

Conclusion: 3C-FBI在精度、速度和鲁棒性上均表现突出，适用于医疗、机器人和工业检测等挑战性场景。

Abstract: This paper addresses the fundamental computer vision challenge of robust
circle detection and fitting in degraded imaging conditions. We present
Combinatorial Convolution-based Circle Fitting for Blurry Images (3C-FBI), an
algorithm that bridges the gap between circle detection and precise parametric
fitting by combining (1) efficient combinatorial edge pixel (edgel) sampling
and (2) convolution-based density estimation in parameter space.
  We evaluate 3C-FBI across three experimental frameworks: (1) real-world
medical data from Parkinson's disease assessments (144 frames from 36 videos),
(2) controlled synthetic data following established circle-fitting benchmarks,
and (3) systematic analysis across varying spatial resolutions and outlier
contamination levels. Results show that 3C-FBI achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy (Jaccard index 0.896) while maintaining real-time performance (40.3
fps), significantly outperforming classical methods like RCD (6.8 fps) on a
standard CPU (i7-10875H). It maintains near-perfect accuracy (Jaccard almost
1.0) at high resolutions (480x480) and reliable performance (Jaccard higher
than 0.95) down to 160x160 with up to 20% outliers.
  In extensive synthetic testing, 3C-FBI achieves a mean Jaccard Index of 0.989
across contamination levels, comparable to modern methods like Qi et al. (2024,
0.991), and surpassing RHT (0.964). This combination of accuracy, speed, and
robustness makes 3C-FBI ideal for medical imaging, robotics, and industrial
inspection under challenging conditions.

Motivation: 解决计算机难以模仿人类颜色感知的问题，填补计算颜色表示与人类视觉感知之间的差距。

Method: 采用三阶段实验方法：初步实验确定可区分颜色刺激，大规模人类分类调查（1000+被试），提取模糊分区并生成隶属函数。

Result: 模型在人类感知对齐上优于RGB、HSV和LAB等传统模型，具有适应性和反馈机制。

Conclusion: COLIBRI模型在设计和人机交互等领域具有重要应用价值，填补了大规模人类样本研究的空白。

Abstract: Colors are omnipresent in today's world and play a vital role in how humans
perceive and interact with their surroundings. However, it is challenging for
computers to imitate human color perception. This paper introduces the Human
Perception-Based Fuzzy Color Model, COLIBRI (Color Linguistic-Based
Representation and Interpretation), designed to bridge the gap between
computational color representations and human visual perception. The proposed
model uses fuzzy sets and logic to create a framework for color categorization.
Using a three-phase experimental approach, the study first identifies
distinguishable color stimuli for hue, saturation, and intensity through
preliminary experiments, followed by a large-scale human categorization survey
involving more than 1000 human subjects. The resulting data are used to extract
fuzzy partitions and generate membership functions that reflect real-world
perceptual uncertainty. The model incorporates a mechanism for adaptation that
allows refinement based on feedback and contextual changes. Comparative
evaluations demonstrate the model's alignment with human perception compared to
traditional color models, such as RGB, HSV, and LAB. To the best of our
knowledge, no previous research has documented the construction of a model for
color attribute specification based on a sample of this size or a comparable
sample of the human population (n = 2496). Our findings are significant for
fields such as design, artificial intelligence, marketing, and human-computer
interaction, where perceptually relevant color representation is critical.

Abstract: EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have shown promise in various
applications, such as motor imagery and cognitive state monitoring. However,
decoding visual representations from EEG signals remains a significant
challenge due to their complex and noisy nature. We thus propose a novel
5-stage framework for decoding visual representations from EEG signals: (1) an
EEG encoder for concept classification, (2) cross-modal alignment of EEG and
text embeddings in CLIP feature space, (3) caption refinement via re-ranking,
(4) weighted interpolation of concept and caption embeddings for richer
semantics, and (5) image generation using a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model.
We enable context-aware EEG-to-image generation through cross-modal alignment
and re-ranking. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates
high-quality images aligned with visual stimuli, outperforming SOTA approaches
by 13.43% in Classification Accuracy, 15.21% in Generation Accuracy and
reducing Fr\'echet Inception Distance by 36.61%, indicating superior semantic
alignment and image quality.

Conclusion: CharaConsist是首个针对DiT模型的文本到图像一致性生成方法，具有广泛的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In text-to-image generation, producing a series of consistent contents that
preserve the same identity is highly valuable for real-world applications.
Although a few works have explored training-free methods to enhance the
consistency of generated subjects, we observe that they suffer from the
following problems. First, they fail to maintain consistent background details,
which limits their applicability. Furthermore, when the foreground character
undergoes large motion variations, inconsistencies in identity and clothing
details become evident. To address these problems, we propose CharaConsist,
which employs point-tracking attention and adaptive token merge along with
decoupled control of the foreground and background. CharaConsist enables
fine-grained consistency for both foreground and background, supporting the
generation of one character in continuous shots within a fixed scene or in
discrete shots across different scenes. Moreover, CharaConsist is the first
consistent generation method tailored for text-to-image DiT model. Its ability
to maintain fine-grained consistency, combined with the larger capacity of
latest base model, enables it to produce high-quality visual outputs,
broadening its applicability to a wider range of real-world scenarios. The

Abstract: Perceiving and reconstructing 4D spatial-temporal geometry from videos is a
fundamental yet challenging computer vision task. To facilitate interactive and
real-time applications, we propose a streaming 4D visual geometry transformer
that shares a similar philosophy with autoregressive large language models. We
explore a simple and efficient design and employ a causal transformer
architecture to process the input sequence in an online manner. We use temporal
causal attention and cache the historical keys and values as implicit memory to
enable efficient streaming long-term 4D reconstruction. This design can handle
real-time 4D reconstruction by incrementally integrating historical information
while maintaining high-quality spatial consistency. For efficient training, we
propose to distill knowledge from the dense bidirectional visual geometry
grounded transformer (VGGT) to our causal model. For inference, our model
supports the migration of optimized efficient attention operator (e.g.,
FlashAttention) from the field of large language models. Extensive experiments
on various 4D geometry perception benchmarks demonstrate that our model
increases the inference speed in online scenarios while maintaining competitive
performance, paving the way for scalable and interactive 4D vision systems.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision, crucial for
applications such as 3D reconstruction, free-viewpoint rendering, robotics,
autonomous driving, and AR/VR technologies. Traditional methods relying on
hardware sensors like LiDAR are often limited by high costs, low resolution,
and environmental sensitivity, limiting their applicability in real-world
scenarios. Recent advances in vision-based methods offer a promising
alternative, yet they face challenges in generalization and stability due to
either the low-capacity model architectures or the reliance on domain-specific
and small-scale datasets. The emergence of scaling laws and foundation models
in other domains has inspired the development of "depth foundation models":
deep neural networks trained on large datasets with strong zero-shot
generalization capabilities. This paper surveys the evolution of deep learning
architectures and paradigms for depth estimation across the monocular, stereo,
multi-view, and monocular video settings. We explore the potential of these
models to address existing challenges and provide a comprehensive overview of
large-scale datasets that can facilitate their development. By identifying key
architectures and training strategies, we aim to highlight the path towards
robust depth foundation models, offering insights into their future research
and applications.

Motivation: 传统CT重建方法存在时间消耗大和辐射高的问题，稀疏X射线图像重建方法可以降低成本与风险，但2D与3D潜在空间对齐困难。

Method: 提出CLS-DM模型，利用跨模态特征对比学习，从2D X射线图像中提取3D潜在信息，并实现模态间的潜在空间对齐。

Result: 在LIDC-IDRI和CTSpine1K数据集上，CLS-DM在PSNR和SSIM指标上优于经典和最新生成模型。

Conclusion: CLS-DM不仅提升了稀疏X射线重建CT的效果，还可推广到其他跨模态转换任务，如文本到图像合成。

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) is a widely utilized imaging modality in clinical
settings. Using densely acquired rotational X-ray arrays, CT can capture 3D
spatial features. However, it is confronted with challenged such as significant
time consumption and high radiation exposure. CT reconstruction methods based
on sparse-view X-ray images have garnered substantial attention from
researchers as they present a means to mitigate costs and risks. In recent
years, diffusion models, particularly the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), have
demonstrated promising potential in the domain of 3D CT reconstruction.
Nonetheless, due to the substantial differences between the 2D latent
representation of X-ray modalities and the 3D latent representation of CT
modalities, the vanilla LDM is incapable of achieving effective alignment
within the latent space. To address this issue, we propose the Consistent
Latent Space Diffusion Model (CLS-DM), which incorporates cross-modal feature
contrastive learning to efficiently extract latent 3D information from 2D X-ray
images and achieve latent space alignment between modalities. Experimental
results indicate that CLS-DM outperforms classical and state-of-the-art
generative models in terms of standard voxel-level metrics (PSNR, SSIM) on the
LIDC-IDRI and CTSpine1K datasets. This methodology not only aids in enhancing
the effectiveness and economic viability of sparse X-ray reconstructed CT but
can also be generalized to other cross-modal transformation tasks, such as
text-to-image synthesis. We have made our code publicly available at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CLS-DM-50D6/ to facilitate further research
and applications in other domains.

Motivation: 在半导体封装中，准确恢复3D信息对于无损检测（NDT）定位电路缺陷至关重要。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了深度学习和物理驱动优化在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: In semiconductor packaging, accurately recovering 3D information is crucial
for non-destructive testing (NDT) to localize circuit defects. This paper
presents a novel approach called the 3D Magnetic Inverse Routine (3D MIR),
which leverages Magnetic Field Images (MFI) to retrieve the parameters for the
3D current flow of a single-segment. The 3D MIR integrates a deep learning
(DL)-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), spatial-physics-based
constraints, and optimization techniques. The method operates in three stages:
i) The CNN model processes the MFI data to predict ($\ell/z_o$), where $\ell$
is the wire length and $z_o$ is the wire's vertical depth beneath the magnetic
sensors and classify segment type ($c$). ii) By leveraging
spatial-physics-based constraints, the routine provides initial estimates for
the position ($x_o$, $y_o$, $z_o$), length ($\ell$), current ($I$), and current
flow direction (positive or negative) of the current segment. iii) An optimizer
then adjusts these five parameters ($x_o$, $y_o$, $z_o$, $\ell$, $I$) to
minimize the difference between the reconstructed MFI and the actual MFI. The
results demonstrate that the 3D MIR method accurately recovers 3D information
with high precision, setting a new benchmark for magnetic image reconstruction
in semiconductor packaging. This method highlights the potential of combining
DL and physics-driven optimization in practical applications.

Abstract: Accurate liver and tumor segmentation on abdominal CT images is critical for
reliable diagnosis and treatment planning, but remains challenging due to
complex anatomical structures, variability in tumor appearance, and limited
annotated data. To address these issues, we introduce Hyperbolic-convolutions
Adaptive-temporal-attention with Neural-representation and Synaptic-plasticity
Network (HANS-Net), a novel segmentation framework that synergistically
combines hyperbolic convolutions for hierarchical geometric representation, a
wavelet-inspired decomposition module for multi-scale texture learning, a
biologically motivated synaptic plasticity mechanism for adaptive feature
enhancement, and an implicit neural representation branch to model fine-grained

uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo dropout to quantify prediction confidence and
lightweight temporal attention to improve inter-slice consistency without
sacrificing efficiency. Extensive evaluations of the LiTS dataset demonstrate
that HANS-Net achieves a mean Dice score of 93.26%, an IoU of 88.09%, an
average symmetric surface distance (ASSD) of 0.72 mm, and a volume overlap
error (VOE) of 11.91%. Furthermore, cross-dataset validation on the

providing anatomically consistent, accurate, and confident liver and tumor
