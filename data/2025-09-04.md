Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DrDiff是一个用于长文本生成的新框架，通过动态专家调度、分层稀疏注意力和软吸收引导优化三项核心技术，在保持质量的同时显著提升生成效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长文本生成中效率与质量之间的权衡问题，传统方法在处理不同难度和长度的文本时计算效率低下。

Method: 1) 动态专家调度机制根据文本复杂度智能分配计算资源；2) 分层稀疏注意力机制将计算复杂度从O(n²)降至O(n)；3) 软吸收引导优化结合DPM-solver++减少扩散步骤。

Result: 在各种长文本生成基准测试中，DrDiff优于现有的最先进方法，证明了其优越性。

Conclusion: DrDiff框架通过三项创新技术成功解决了长文本生成的效率-质量权衡问题，为高效高质量的长文本生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces DrDiff, a novel framework for long-text generation that
overcomes the efficiency-quality trade-off through three core technologies.
First, we design a dynamic expert scheduling mechanism that intelligently
allocates computational resources during the diffusion process based on text
complexity, enabling more efficient handling of text generation tasks of
varying difficulty. Second, we introduce a Hierarchical Sparse Attention (HSA)
mechanism that adaptively adjusts attention patterns according to a variety of
input lengths, reducing computational complexity from O($n^2$) to O($n$) while
maintaining model performance. Finally, we propose a soft absorption guidance
optimization strategy that combines with DPM-solver++ to reduce diffusion
steps, significantly improving generation speed. Comprehensive experiments on
various long-text generation benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our
DrDiff over the existing SOTA methods.

### [2] [SSVD: Structured SVD for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning and Benchmarking under Domain Shift in ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02830)
*Pu Wang,Shinji Watanabe,Hugo Van hamme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文综述了参数高效微调(PEFT)方法在语音识别中的应用，展现了结构化SVD导向(SSVD)微调新方法，并在ESPnet中完成了综合性的基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然低秩适配(LoRA)在语音应用中广泛使用，但其最新变体(如VeRA、DoRA、PiSSA、SVFT)主要为语言和视觉任务开发，在语音领域缺乏充分验证。

Method: 提出结构化SVD导向(SSVD)微调方法，选择性旋转输入相关的右奇异向量，同时保持输出相关向量固定以保留语义映射。在ESPnet中集成并对比各种PEFT方法。

Result: 在域转移语音识别任务(包括儿童语音和方言变体)上进行评估，模型规模从0.1B到2B。SSVD方法实现了最小的可训练参数量和提升的效率。

Conclusion: 该研究为语音领域提供了第一个综合性的PEFT方法对比分析，SSVD方法能够在保持语义映射的同时实现稳健的域适配。所有实现已开源以支持可复现性和未来研究。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a scalable solution for
adapting large foundation models. While low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is widely
used in speech applications, its state-of-the-art variants, e.g., VeRA, DoRA,
PiSSA, and SVFT, are developed mainly for language and vision tasks, with
limited validation in speech. This work presents the first comprehensive
integration and benchmarking of these PEFT methods within ESPnet. We further
introduce structured SVD-guided (SSVD) fine-tuning, which selectively rotates
input-associated right singular vectors while keeping output-associated vectors
fixed to preserve semantic mappings. This design enables robust domain
adaptation with minimal trainable parameters and improved efficiency. We
evaluate all methods on domain-shifted speech recognition tasks, including
child speech and dialectal variation, across model scales from 0.1B to 2B. All
implementations are released in ESPnet to support reproducibility and future
work.

### [3] [Clustering Discourses: Racial Biases in Short Stories about Women Generated by Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02834)
*Gustavo Bonil,João Gondim,Marina dos Santos,Simone Hashiguti,Helena Maia,Nadia Silva,Helio Pedrini,Sandra Avila*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究分析LLaMA 3.2-3B模型生成的葡萄牙语短篇小说中关于黑人和白人女性的叙事结构，发现存在三种主要话语表征，揭示了看似中立的文本实则强化殖民结构下的性别不平等


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型如何构建关于不同种族女性的叙事，特别关注看似语法连贯的中立文本是否实际上强化了历史上的不平等结构

Method: 从2100篇生成文本中应用计算方法进行语义聚类，选择代表性样本进行定性话语分析，结合机器学习技术和人工分析

Result: 识别出三种主要话语表征：社会克服、祖先神话化和主观自我实现，发现文本表面中立但实际体现了殖民结构化的女性身体框架

Conclusion: 需要采用机器学习与定性分析相结合的综合方法来揭示AI生成文本中隐含的偏见和不平等结构，这些文本在语法正确性掩盖下强化了历史不平等

Abstract: This study investigates how large language models, in particular LLaMA
3.2-3B, construct narratives about Black and white women in short stories
generated in Portuguese. From 2100 texts, we applied computational methods to
group semantically similar stories, allowing a selection for qualitative
analysis. Three main discursive representations emerge: social overcoming,
ancestral mythification and subjective self-realization. The analysis uncovers
how grammatically coherent, seemingly neutral texts materialize a crystallized,
colonially structured framing of the female body, reinforcing historical
inequalities. The study proposes an integrated approach, that combines machine
learning techniques with qualitative, manual discourse analysis.

### [4] [IDEAlign: Comparing Large Language Models to Human Experts in Open-ended Interpretive Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02855)
*Hyunji Nam,Lucia Langlois,James Malamut,Mei Tan,Dorottya Demszky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了IDEAlgin框架，用于大规模评估LLM在解释性标注任务中的表现，通过"三选一"任务获取专家相似度评分，发现基于向量的方法效果不佳，而LLM作为评判者能显著提升与专家判断的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM越来越多地应用于开放式解释性标注任务（如主题分析、学生作业反馈），需要一种可扩展的方法来评估LLM生成标注与专家标注的相似性，但目前缺乏有效的规模化评估指标。

Method: 提出IDEAlgin基准框架，采用"三选一"三元组判断任务获取专家相似度评分；评估多种相似性度量方法，包括基于向量的方法（主题模型、嵌入）和LLM作为评判者。

Result: 在两个真实教育数据集上的实验表明，基于向量的方法难以捕捉专家关注的细微相似性维度；使用IDEAlgin框架的LLM评判相比传统词汇和向量方法，与专家判断的一致性提升了9-30%。

Conclusion: IDEAlgin为大规模评估LLM在开放式专家标注任务中的表现提供了有前景的范式，有助于在教育等领域负责任地部署LLM。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to open-ended,
interpretive annotation tasks, such as thematic analysis by researchers or
generating feedback on student work by teachers. These tasks involve free-text
annotations requiring expert-level judgments grounded in specific objectives
(e.g., research questions or instructional goals). Evaluating whether
LLM-generated annotations align with those generated by expert humans is
challenging to do at scale, and currently, no validated, scalable measure of
similarity in ideas exists. In this paper, we (i) introduce the scalable
evaluation of interpretive annotation by LLMs as a critical and understudied
task, (ii) propose IDEAlgin, an intuitive benchmarking paradigm for capturing
expert similarity ratings via a "pick-the-odd-one-out" triplet judgment task,
and (iii) evaluate various similarity metrics, including vector-based ones
(topic models, embeddings) and LLM-as-a-judge via IDEAlgin, against these human
benchmarks. Applying this approach to two real-world educational datasets
(interpretive analysis and feedback generation), we find that vector-based
metrics largely fail to capture the nuanced dimensions of similarity meaningful
to experts. Prompting LLMs via IDEAlgin significantly improves alignment with
expert judgments (9-30% increase) compared to traditional lexical and
vector-based metrics. These results establish IDEAlgin as a promising paradigm
for evaluating LLMs against open-ended expert annotations at scale, informing
responsible deployment of LLMs in education and beyond.

### [5] [A-SEA3L-QA: A Fully Automated Self-Evolving, Adversarial Workflow for Arabic Long-Context Question-Answer Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02864)
*Kesen Wang,Daulet Toibazar,Pedro J. Moreno*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 一种防御性自我迭代流程，通过多个专门LVLM协作，在无人干预情况下自动生成和精炼阿拉伯语长文本问答数据，显著提升了阿拉伯语大视觉语言模型的长文本理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决阿拉伯语长文本问答任务的挑战，提高阿拉伯语大视觉语言模型的长文本理解能力，通过自动化流程减少人工干预需求。

Method: 设计了一个结构化的防御性工作流程，包含问题生成器、评估器和答案生成器群。通过闭环迭代过程，低信心度输出触发自动重新生成和模型更新，支持可调难度级别的问题生成。

Result: 构建了AraLongBench大规模阿拉伯语长文本测试集，证明自我迭代流程显著超过静态流程，大幅提升了阿拉伯语LVLM的长文本理解能力。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种高效的自动化方案，能够在无人干预情况下不断提升阿拉伯语长文本问答的质量，为阿拉伯语语言模型的发展提供了重要技术支撑。

Abstract: We present an end-to-end, self-evolving adversarial workflow for long-context
Question-Answer (QA) Generation in Arabic. By orchestrating multiple
specialized LVLMs: a question generator, an evaluator, and a swarm of answer
generators, our system iteratively refines its own performance without any
human intervention. Starting from raw, multi-page Arabic documents across
diverse domains, the question generator produces fine-grained, context-aware
queries to be tackled by the answer generator swarm, and the evaluator assesses
and feeds back quality metrics. This closed-loop cycle enables continuous
learning: low-confidence outputs trigger automated re-generation and model
updates, progressively enhancing question difficulty and relevance. Moreover,
we set the quality metrics as a tunable hyperparameter, enabling question
generation at controllable and customizable difficulty levels. We release
AraLongBench, a large-scale Arabic benchmark of single- and multi-page
challenges spanning hundreds of pages, and demonstrate that our self-evolving
workflow substantially outperform static pipelines, markedly boosting the
long-context comprehension capabilities of leading Arabic Large Vision Language
Models (LVLMs). Lastly, we also meticulously architect a fully automated
agentic workflow for long-context Arabic document collection.

### [6] [Advancing Minority Stress Detection with Transformers: Insights from the Social Media Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02908)
*Santosh Chapagain,Cory J Cascalheira,Shah Muhammad Hamdi,Soukaina Filali Boubrahimi,Jillian R. Scheer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究首次全面评估基于Transformer的架构在在线话语中检测少数群体压力的能力，发现整合图结构能持续提升检测性能，图增强的Transformer模型为数字健康干预提供最可靠基础


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 性少数群体因少数群体压力而经历不成比例的高健康问题和精神障碍率，需要有效的方法来检测在线话语中的少数群体压力

Method: 使用ELECTRA、BERT、RoBERTa、BART等Transformer模型与传统机器学习基线及图增强变体进行基准测试，评估零样本和少样本学习范式，在两个最大的公开Reddit语料库上进行实验

Result: 整合图结构持续提升检测性能，监督微调加关系上下文优于零样本和少样本方法，图增强能更好识别身份隐藏、内化污名等关键语言标记

Conclusion: 图增强的Transformer模型为数字健康干预和公共卫生政策提供了最可靠的基础

Abstract: Individuals from sexual and gender minority groups experience
disproportionately high rates of poor health outcomes and mental disorders
compared to their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts, largely as a
consequence of minority stress as described by Meyer's (2003) model. This study
presents the first comprehensive evaluation of transformer-based architectures
for detecting minority stress in online discourse. We benchmark multiple
transformer models including ELECTRA, BERT, RoBERTa, and BART against
traditional machine learning baselines and graph-augmented variants. We further
assess zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms to assess their applicability
on underrepresented datasets. Experiments are conducted on the two largest
publicly available Reddit corpora for minority stress detection, comprising
12,645 and 5,789 posts, and are repeated over five random seeds to ensure
robustness. Our results demonstrate that integrating graph structure
consistently improves detection performance across transformer-only models and
that supervised fine-tuning with relational context outperforms zero and
few-shot approaches. Theoretical analysis reveals that modeling social
connectivity and conversational context via graph augmentation sharpens the
models' ability to identify key linguistic markers such as identity
concealment, internalized stigma, and calls for support, suggesting that
graph-enhanced transformers offer the most reliable foundation for digital
health interventions and public health policy.

### [7] [English Pronunciation Evaluation without Complex Joint Training: LoRA Fine-tuned Speech Multimodal LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02915)
*Taekyung Ahn,Hosung Nam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过LoRA微调多模态大语言模型，实现了同时进行自动发音评估和错误发音检测诊断的集成化方案，无需复杂结构改造或分离训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的自动发音评估(APA)和错误发音检测诊断(MDD)需要复杂的结构改造和分离训练流程，本研究旨在通过简化的微调方法实现集成化解决方案。

Method: 使用Microsoft Phi-4-multimodal-instruct模型，通过Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)微调技术，在Speechocean762数据集上进行训练，只微调LoRA层而不需全部模型参数调整。

Result: 模型预测的发音评分与人工评分呈现强相关性(PCC > 0.7)，词误率(WER)和音素误率(PER)均低于0.15，且只微调LoRA层的性能与微调所有音频层相当。

Conclusion: 证明了通过LoRA微调大型多模态模型可以以简单的方式建立集成化发音评估系统，为英语L2学习者提供更可访、集成和有效的计算机辅助发音训练技术。

Abstract: This study demonstrates that a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) adapted
via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can perform both Automatic Pronunciation
Assessment (APA) and Mispronunciation Detection and Diagnosis (MDD)
simultaneously. Leveraging Microsoft's Phi-4-multimodal-instruct, our
fine-tuning method eliminates the need for complex architectural changes or
separate training procedures conventionally required for these distinct tasks.
Fine-tuned on the Speechocean762 dataset, the pronunciation evaluation scores
predicted by the model exhibited a strong Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC
> 0.7) with human-assigned scores, while achieving low Word Error Rate (WER)
and Phoneme Error Rate (PER) (both < 0.15). Notably, fine-tuning only the LoRA
layers was sufficient to achieve performance levels comparable to those
achieved by fine-tuning all audio layers. This research highlights that an
integrated pronunciation assessment system can be established by adapting large
multimodal models without full fine-tuning, utilizing a significantly simpler
training methodology compared to previous joint models designed for
simultaneous APA and MDD. This efficient LoRA-based approach paves the way for
more accessible, integrated, and effective Computer-Assisted Pronunciation
Training (CAPT) technologies for English L2 learners.

*Youngwoo Kim,Himanshu Beniwal,Steven L. Johnson,Thomas Hartvigsen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过可解释的词法表格从历史审核数据中提取隐式内容审核标准，开队了解不同社区的实际执行规范


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线社区如subreddit通常使用多样化、隐式的审核标准，需要一种方法来明确识别和提取这些隐式标准

Method: 使用可解释的架构从历史审核数据中提取隐式标准，将审核标准表示为与内容删除相关联的词法表达式的分数表

Result: 提取的词法模式能够有效复现神经网络审核模型的性能，同时提供透明的决策见解，发现了社区特定的语言容忍度、主题限制特征以及有害言论的隐藏子类别

Conclusion: 该方法能够系统性地提取和比较不同社区的隐式审核标准，揭示了表面共享规范的实际执行差异，为内容审核系统提供了透明可解释的见解

Abstract: Effective content moderation systems require explicit classification
criteria, yet online communities like subreddits often operate with diverse,
implicit standards. This work introduces a novel approach to identify and
extract these implicit criteria from historical moderation data using an
interpretable architecture. We represent moderation criteria as score tables of
lexical expressions associated with content removal, enabling systematic
comparison across different communities. Our experiments demonstrate that these
extracted lexical patterns effectively replicate the performance of neural
moderation models while providing transparent insights into decision-making
processes. The resulting criteria matrix reveals significant variations in how
seemingly shared norms are actually enforced, uncovering previously
undocumented moderation patterns including community-specific tolerances for
language, features for topical restrictions, and underlying subcategories of
the toxic speech classification.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个新的多模态QA数据集ProMQA-Assembly，用于评估装配活动中的助手系统，包含391个QA对，需要理解人类活动记录和说明书，并采用半自动标注方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏支持应用导向系统评估的测试平台，特别是在装配任务中，需要促进相关技术的发展。

Method: 采用半自动QA标注方法，使用LLM生成候选问题并由人工验证，整合细粒度动作标签以多样化问题类型，创建指令任务图辅助标注和评估。

Result: 基准测试显示当前多模态模型仍有很大改进空间，包括竞争性专有模型也存在不足。

Conclusion: 新的评估数据集ProMQA-Assembly能够促进程序性活动助手系统的进一步发展。

Abstract: Assistants on assembly tasks have a large potential to benefit humans from
everyday tasks to industrial settings. However, no testbeds support
application-oriented system evaluation in a practical setting, especially in
assembly. To foster the development, we propose a new multimodal QA dataset on
assembly activities. Our dataset, ProMQA-Assembly, consists of 391 QA pairs
that require the multimodal understanding of human-activity recordings and
their instruction manuals in an online-style manner. In the development, we
adopt a semi-automated QA annotation approach, where LLMs generate candidates
and humans verify them, as a cost-effective method, and further improve it by
integrating fine-grained action labels to diversify question types.
Furthermore, we create instruction task graphs for the target tasks of
assembling toy vehicles. These newly created task graphs are used in our
benchmarking experiment, as well as to facilitate the human verification
process in the QA annotation. Utilizing our dataset, we benchmark models,
including competitive proprietary multimodal models. Our results suggest great
room for improvement for the current models. We believe our new evaluation
dataset can contribute to the further development of procedural-activity
assistants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理治疗因社会污名和治疗师资源有限而难以普及，大语言模型具备专业心理治疗技能后可扩大心理健康服务覆盖范围，但缺乏心理学对话数据集制约了有效心理咨询对话代理的开发

Method: 构建基于认知行为疗法(CBT)的长周期对话语料库，包含多次咨询会话，整合认知概念化图表(CCDs)指导不同场景下的客户模拟，训练深度咨询模型并建立综合评估框架

Result: DiaCBT有效增强了大语言模型模拟具备CBT专业知识的心理学家的能力，证明了其在训练更专业咨询代理方面的潜力

Conclusion: 该数据集为开发有效的心理治疗引导对话代理提供了重要资源，展示了利用专业数据集提升AI心理咨询专业性的可行性

Abstract: Psychotherapy reaches only a small fraction of individuals suffering from
mental disorders due to social stigma and the limited availability of
therapists. Large language models (LLMs), when equipped with professional
psychotherapeutic skills, offer a promising solution to expand access to mental
health services. However, the lack of psychological conversation datasets
presents significant challenges in developing effective psychotherapy-guided
conversational agents. In this paper, we construct a long-periodic dialogue
corpus for counseling based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Our curated
dataset includes multiple sessions for each counseling and incorporates
cognitive conceptualization diagrams (CCDs) to guide client simulation across
diverse scenarios. To evaluate the utility of our dataset, we train an in-depth
counseling model and present a comprehensive evaluation framework to benchmark
it against established psychological criteria for CBT-based counseling. Results
demonstrate that DiaCBT effectively enhances LLMs' ability to emulate
psychologists with CBT expertise, underscoring its potential for training more
professional counseling agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过提出新的BLV损失函数，解决自动说话评估中的类别不平衡问题，提高少数类的识别准确性和模型公平性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动说话评估(ASA)模型遇到类别不平衡问题，导致对少数类的偏见预测，影响二语学习者技能评估的准确性和公平性

Method: 提出了一种新的训练目标函数，称为平衡逻辑变异(BLV)损失，通过干扰模型预测来改善少数类的特征表示，无需修改数据集

Result: 在ICNALE标准数据集上评估显示，将BLV损失集成到以BERT为基础的文本模型中，显著提高了分类准确性和公平性

Conclusion: BLV损失能够有效解决ASA模型中的类别不平衡问题，使得自动语音评估更加健壮，更适用于不同水平的学习者

Abstract: Automated Speaking Assessment (ASA) plays a crucial role in evaluating
second-language (L2) learners proficiency. However, ASA models often suffer
from class imbalance, leading to biased predictions. To address this, we
introduce a novel objective for training ASA models, dubbed the Balancing Logit
Variation (BLV) loss, which perturbs model predictions to improve feature
representation for minority classes without modifying the dataset. Evaluations
on the ICNALE benchmark dataset show that integrating the BLV loss into a
celebrated text-based (BERT) model significantly enhances classification
accuracy and fairness, making automated speech evaluation more robust for
diverse learners.

*Chang Su,Dengliang Shi,Siyuan Huang,Jintao Du,Changhua Meng,Yu Cheng,Weiqiang Wang,Zhouhan Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出在对比学习前增加双向生成重建训练阶段，通过EBQ2D和EBD2Q任务增强[EOS]标记的语义表示能力，显著提升LLM在文本嵌入任务上的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM文本嵌入方法使用最终特殊标记（如[EOS]）的嵌入，但这些标记并未经过专门训练来捕获整个上下文的语义，限制了其在检索和重排序任务中的能力

Method: 在对比学习前增加新的训练阶段，采用双向生成重建任务：EBQ2D（基于嵌入的查询到文档重建）和EBD2Q（基于嵌入的文档到查询重建），交替进行以锚定[EOS]嵌入并重建查询-文档对的两端

Result: 实验结果显示，额外的训练阶段显著提升了LLM在Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB)上的性能，在不同LLM基础模型和规模上都达到了新的最先进结果

Conclusion: 通过引入双向生成重建训练阶段来丰富最终标记嵌入的语义，可以有效提升LLM作为文本嵌入器的能力，特别是在检索和重排序任务中表现突出

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been explored as powerful text
embedders. Existing LLM-based text embedding approaches often leverage the
embedding of the final token, typically a reserved special token such as [EOS].
However, these tokens have not been intentionally trained to capture the
semantics of the whole context, limiting their capacity as text embeddings,
especially for retrieval and re-ranking tasks. We propose to add a new training
stage before contrastive learning to enrich the semantics of the final token
embedding. This stage employs bidirectional generative reconstruction tasks,
namely EBQ2D (Embedding-Based Query-to-Document) and EBD2Q (Embedding-Based
Document-to-Query), which interleave to anchor the [EOS] embedding and
reconstruct either side of Query-Document pairs. Experimental results
demonstrate that our additional training stage significantly improves LLM
performance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), achieving new
state-of-the-art results across different LLM base models and scales.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型精调中存在的参数冗余、结构固化和任务适应性局限等问题，提高模型的灵活性和效率。

Method: 提出基于结构可学习机制的适配器精调方法，使用微分门函数和结构稀疏控制变量，在训练过程中动态构建任务特定的高效子结构，保持主干参数冻结。

Result: 在多个多任务自然语言理解任务上，该方法超越主流的参数高效调整技术，在准确率、压缩率以及对噪声和干扰的稳健性方面实现了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结构搜索机制显著提高了参数利用率和表征能力，并通过敏感性分析实验验证了其稳定性和鲁棒性，为大语言模型的灵活精调提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the issues of parameter redundancy, rigid structure, and
limited task adaptability in the fine-tuning of large language models. It
proposes an adapter-based fine-tuning method built on a structure-learnable
mechanism. By introducing differentiable gating functions and structural
sparsity control variables, the method enables automatic optimization of
adapter insertion points, activation paths, and module combinations. This
allows the model to adjust its structure flexibly in multi-task settings to
match different task characteristics. With the backbone parameters kept frozen,
the method uses a structure search mechanism to guide the dynamic construction
of task-specific efficient substructures during training. This significantly
improves parameter utilization and representational capacity. In addition, the
paper designs a set of sensitivity analysis experiments to systematically
evaluate the effects of sparsity weight, noise injection ratio, and data
perturbation on model performance. These experiments verify the stability and
robustness of the proposed method across various multi-task natural language
understanding tasks. The experimental results show that the proposed method
outperforms mainstream parameter-efficient tuning techniques on multiple tasks.
It achieves a better balance among accuracy, compression rate, and robustness
to noise and perturbation.

Motivation: 商业情感分析是自然语言处理的重要应用领域，传统RNN存在梯度消失问题，需要改进模型来提高情感分析的准确性。

Method: 使用长短期记忆网络(LSTM)替代传统RNN，构建改进的RNN模型。采用产品评论数据集，70%数据用于训练，30%用于测试。

Result: 改进的LSTM模型达到91.33%的准确率，性能优于传统RNN模型。

Conclusion: 提出的LSTM模型能有效解决梯度消失问题，为商业公司和电商平台提供准确的情感分析工具，帮助优化营销策略。

Abstract: Business sentiment analysis (BSA) is one of the significant and popular
topics of natural language processing. It is one kind of sentiment analysis
techniques for business purposes. Different categories of sentiment analysis
techniques like lexicon-based techniques and different types of machine
learning algorithms are applied for sentiment analysis on different languages
like English, Hindi, Spanish, etc. In this paper, long short-term memory (LSTM)
is applied for business sentiment analysis, where a recurrent neural network is
used. An LSTM model is used in a modified approach to prevent the vanishing
gradient problem rather than applying the conventional recurrent neural network
(RNN). To apply the modified RNN model, product review dataset is used. In this
experiment, 70\% of the data is trained for the LSTM and the rest 30\% of the
data is used for testing. The result of this modified RNN model is compared
with other conventional RNN models, and a comparison is made among the results.
It is noted that the proposed model performs better than the other conventional
RNN models. Here, the proposed model, i.e., the modified RNN model approach has
achieved around 91.33\% of accuracy. By applying this model, any business
company or e-commerce business site can identify the feedback from their
customers about different types of products that customers like or dislike.
Based on the customer reviews, a business company or e-commerce platform can
evaluate its marketing strategy.

Method: 使用政治学文献的多个数据集，评估四种方法：直接点评分、成对比较聚合、令牌概率加权点评分和精调

Result: 直接点评分产生不连续分布，成对比较改善质量，令牌概率加权表现更好，精调小模型用少量数据即可超过提示的大模型

Conclusion: 令牌概率加权点评分和小模型精调是测量连续语义结构的最佳方法，为应用研究者提供了可操作的建议

Abstract: Many constructs that characterize language, like its complexity or
emotionality, have a naturally continuous semantic structure; a public speech
is not just "simple" or "complex," but exists on a continuum between extremes.
Although large language models (LLMs) are an attractive tool for measuring
scalar constructs, their idiosyncratic treatment of numerical outputs raises
questions of how to best apply them. We address these questions with a
comprehensive evaluation of LLM-based approaches to scalar construct
measurement in social science. Using multiple datasets sourced from the
political science literature, we evaluate four approaches: unweighted direct
pointwise scoring, aggregation of pairwise comparisons,
token-probability-weighted pointwise scoring, and finetuning. Our study yields
actionable findings for applied researchers. First, LLMs prompted to generate
pointwise scores directly from texts produce discontinuous distributions with
bunching at arbitrary numbers. The quality of the measurements improves with
pairwise comparisons made by LLMs, but it improves even more by taking
pointwise scores and weighting them by token probability. Finally, finetuning
smaller models with as few as 1,000 training pairs can match or exceed the
performance of prompted LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于知识编辑的轻量级LLM指纹注入方法FSFT，通过约束指纹子空间更新来减少大规模微调时的指纹退化，性能比传统微调提升10%以上


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于指令调优的LLM知识产权保护方法存在性能下降严重、计算资源需求大、模型修改后持久性差等问题，需要更轻量级的指纹注入方案

Method: 首次将知识编辑应用于指纹注入，使用乱码文本作为指纹防止被覆盖，并提出指纹子空间感知微调(FSFT)来约束指纹子空间的更新

Result: FSFT在最坏情况下性能仍超过传统微调10%以上，但发现指纹注入模型难以区分指纹和相似文本，特征相似度高

Conclusion: 知识编辑为LLM指纹注入提供了轻量级替代方案，FSFT有效减少指纹退化，但需要开发更鲁棒和细粒度的指纹注入方法

Abstract: The intellectual property (IP) protection of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
increasingly critical. Injecting specialized fingerprints into LLMs through
instruction tuning is a common IP protection technique. However, this may
significantly degrade model performance, requires substantial computational
resources, and exhibits poor persistence under model modifications. We argue
that knowledge editing offers a lightweight alternative that is more suitable
for fingerprint injection. Accordingly, we apply knowledge editing to
fingerprint injection for the first time and demonstrate its strong capability.
Despite using scrambled text as fingerprints to prevent them from being
overwritten during fine-tuning, degradation still occurs under large-scale
fine-tuning. To address this, we propose Fingerprint Subspace-aware Fine-Tuning
(FSFT), which reduces fingerprint degradation by constraining the update of the
fingerprint subspace. The performance of FSFT exceeds fine-tuning by 10% even
in the worst-case scenario. Additionally, we observe that the
fingerprint-injected models struggle to distinguish between fingerprints and
similar texts due to the high similarity of their features. This finding
underscores the urgent need for more robust and fine-grained fingerprinting
injection methods for LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索计算模型生成的词汇处理测量是否能够预测实验数据，以及这些模型测量与传统预测因子如词频、邻居规模和语法变体规模的比较。

Method: 进行大规模单个受试者实验，结合眼动跟踪技术和单词命名任务，使用广义加性模型分析5个响应变量，对比辨别性词典模型和经典预测因孕的预测效果。

Result: DLM基础测量是强有力的预测因子，深度学习DLM并不比线性映射更精确，经典预测因子通常预测效果更好（总回视时间除外），命名任务中词汇变量对初始回视时间和回视次数无预测作用。

Conclusion: DLM测量对总回视时间、命吁延迟和语音持续时间的预测能力表明意义在单词命名任务中起重要作用。

Abstract: This study investigates lexical processing in Estonian. A large-scale
single-subject experiment is reported that combines the word naming task with
eye-tracking. Five response variables (first fixation duration, total fixation
duration, number of fixations, word naming latency, and spoken word duration)
are analyzed with the generalized additive model. Of central interest is the
question of whether measures for lexical processing generated by a
computational model of the mental lexicon (the Discriminative Lexicon Model,
DLM) are predictive for these response variables, and how they compare to
classical predictors such as word frequency, neighborhood size, and
inflectional paradigm size. Computational models were implemented both with
linear and deep mappings. Central findings are, first, that DLM-based measures
are powerful predictors for lexical processing, second, that DLM-measures using
deep learning are not necessarily more precise predictors of lexical processing
than DLM-measures using linear mappings, third, that classical predictors tend
to provide somewhat more precise fits compared to DLM-based predictors (except
for total fixation duration, where the two provide equivalent goodness of fit),
and fourth, that in the naming task lexical variables are not predictive for
first fixation duration and the total number of fixations. As the DLM works
with mappings from form to meaning, the predictivity of DLM-based measures for
total fixation duration, naming latencies, and spoken word duration indicates
that meaning is heavily involved in the present word naming task.

Abstract: The Romansh language, spoken in Switzerland, has limited resources for
machine translation evaluation. In this paper, we present a benchmark for six
varieties of Romansh: Rumantsch Grischun, a supra-regional variety, and five

Conclusion: 直接微调预训练LLMs处理流程数据是一种有效的方法，在预测性流程监控任务中展现出优越性能，特别是在多任务场景下，同时具有计算效率和易用性优势。

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a prominent
area of interest across various research domains, including Process Mining
(PM). Current applications in PM have predominantly centered on prompt
engineering strategies or the transformation of event logs into narrative-style
datasets, thereby exploiting the semantic capabilities of LLMs to address
diverse tasks. In contrast, this study investigates the direct adaptation of
pretrained LLMs to process data without natural language reformulation,
motivated by the fact that these models excel in generating sequences of
tokens, similar to the objective in PM. More specifically, we focus on
parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques to mitigate the computational
overhead typically associated with such models. Our experimental setup focuses
on Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM), and considers both single- and
multi-task predictions. The results demonstrate a potential improvement in
predictive performance over state-of-the-art recurrent neural network (RNN)
approaches and recent narrative-style-based solutions, particularly in the
multi-task setting. Additionally, our fine-tuned models exhibit faster
convergence and require significantly less hyperparameter optimization.

Method: 创建专门针对僧伽罗语的SinhalaMMLU数据集，包含7000多个选择题，涵盖6个领域30个科目，基于斯里兰卡国家课程体系

Result: 评估26个LLM显示Claude 3.5 sonnet(67%)和GPT-4o(62%)准确率最高，但整体表现有限，在人文学科等文化丰富领域表现较差

Conclusion: LLM在低资源语言和文化特定语境下的适应能力仍有很大改进空间，需要更多针对性的评测和优化

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive general knowledge and
reasoning abilities, yet their evaluation has predominantly focused on global
or anglocentric subjects, often neglecting low-resource languages and
culturally specific content. While recent multilingual benchmarks attempt to
bridge this gap, many rely on automatic translation, which can introduce errors
and misrepresent the original cultural context. To address this, we introduce
SinhalaMMLU, the first multiple-choice question answering benchmark designed
specifically for Sinhala, a low-resource language. The dataset includes over
7,000 questions spanning secondary to collegiate education levels, aligned with
the Sri Lankan national curriculum, and covers six domains and 30 subjects,
encompassing both general academic topics and culturally grounded knowledge. We
evaluate 26 LLMs on SinhalaMMLU and observe that, while Claude 3.5 sonnet and
GPT-4o achieve the highest average accuracies at 67% and 62% respectively,
overall model performance remains limited. In particular, models struggle in
culturally rich domains such as the Humanities, revealing substantial room for
improvement in adapting LLMs to low-resource and culturally specific contexts.

TL;DR: AgenTracer是一个自动化框架，通过反事实重放和程序化故障注入来标注多智能体系统失败轨迹，并训练出轻量级故障追踪模型AgenTracer-8B，在智能体故障归因任务上大幅超越大型专有LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based多智能体系统虽然性能优越但脆弱性高，现有推理LLM在故障归因任务上准确率低于10%，需要专门解决方案。

Method: 提出AgenTracer框架，使用反事实重放和程序化故障注入创建TracerTraj数据集，然后通过多粒度强化学习训练轻量级故障追踪模型AgenTracer-8B。

Result: AgenTracer-8B在Who&When基准测试中比Gemini-2.5-Pro和Claude-4-Sonnet等大型专有LLM性能提升高达18.18%，并为MetaGPT和MaAS等多智能体系统带来4.8-14.2%的性能增益。

Conclusion: AgenTracer为LLM智能体系统提供了有效的故障诊断和自修正能力，推动了自进化智能体AI的发展。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems, often comprising multiple
models, complex tool invocations, and orchestration protocols, substantially
outperform monolithic agents. Yet this very sophistication amplifies their
fragility, making them more prone to system failure. Pinpointing the specific
agent or step responsible for an error within long execution traces defines the
task of agentic system failure attribution. Current state-of-the-art reasoning
LLMs, however, remain strikingly inadequate for this challenge, with accuracy
generally below 10%. To address this gap, we propose AgenTracer, the first
automated framework for annotating failed multi-agent trajectories via
counterfactual replay and programmed fault injection, producing the curated
dataset TracerTraj. Leveraging this resource, we develop AgenTracer-8B, a
lightweight failure tracer trained with multi-granular reinforcement learning,
capable of efficiently diagnosing errors in verbose multi-agent interactions.
On the Who&When benchmark, AgenTracer-8B outperforms giant proprietary LLMs
like Gemini-2.5-Pro and Claude-4-Sonnet by up to 18.18%, setting a new standard
in LLM agentic failure attribution. More importantly, AgenTracer-8B delivers
actionable feedback to off-the-shelf multi-agent systems like MetaGPT and MaAS
with 4.8-14.2% performance gains, empowering self-correcting and self-evolving
agentic AI.

TL;DR: LMEnt是一个用于分析语言模型预训练过程中知识获取的套件，包含知识丰富的标注语料库、高效的实体检索方法和多个预训练模型及检查点，为研究知识表示和学习动态提供可控环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在现实应用中需要世界知识，但模型如何将数据转化为知识表示的过程尚不明确。理解这些过程有助于开发更一致、鲁棒和完整的知识表示模型。

Method: 提出LMEnt套件，包括：(1)基于Wikipedia的完全实体标注的知识丰富预训练语料库；(2)比先前方法性能提升80.4%的基于实体的检索方法；(3)12个最多10亿参数的预训练模型和4000个中间检查点。

Result: LMEnt提供了一个受控环境来分析预训练中实体提及与下游性能的关系，以及预训练数据中因果干预的效果。研究发现事实频率是关键因素，但不能完全解释学习趋势。

Conclusion: LMEnt支持语言模型中知识表示、可塑性、编辑、归因和学习动态的研究，相关资源已公开发布以促进该领域研究。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) increasingly drive real-world applications that require
world knowledge. However, the internal processes through which models turn data
into representations of knowledge and beliefs about the world, are poorly
understood. Insights into these processes could pave the way for developing LMs
with knowledge representations that are more consistent, robust, and complete.
To facilitate studying these questions, we present LMEnt, a suite for analyzing
knowledge acquisition in LMs during pretraining. LMEnt introduces: (1) a
knowledge-rich pretraining corpus, fully annotated with entity mentions, based
on Wikipedia, (2) an entity-based retrieval method over pretraining data that
outperforms previous approaches by as much as 80.4%, and (3) 12 pretrained
models with up to 1B parameters and 4K intermediate checkpoints, with
comparable performance to popular open-sourced models on knowledge benchmarks.
Together, these resources provide a controlled environment for analyzing
connections between entity mentions in pretraining and downstream performance,
and the effects of causal interventions in pretraining data. We show the
utility of LMEnt by studying knowledge acquisition across checkpoints, finding
that fact frequency is key, but does not fully explain learning trends. We
release LMEnt to support studies of knowledge in LMs, including knowledge
representations, plasticity, editing, attribution, and learning dynamics.

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) enables the understanding and generation of
meaningful human language, typically using a pre-trained complex architecture
on a large dataset to learn the language and next fine-tune its weights to
implement a specific task. Twofold goals are examined; to understand the
mechanism underlying successful pre-training and to determine the interplay
between the pre-training accuracy and the fine-tuning of classification tasks.
The following main results were obtained; the accuracy per token (APT)
increased with its appearance frequency in the dataset, and its average over
all tokens served as an order parameter to quantify pre-training success, which
increased along the transformer blocks. Pre-training broke the symmetry among
tokens and grouped them into finite, small, strong match token clusters, as
inferred from the presented token confusion matrix. This feature was sharpened
along the transformer blocks toward the output layer, enhancing its performance
considerably compared with that of the embedding layer. Consequently,
higher-order language structures were generated by pre-training, even though
the learning cost function was directed solely at identifying a single token.
These pre-training findings were reflected by the improved fine-tuning accuracy
along the transformer blocks. Additionally, the output label prediction
confidence was found to be independent of the average input APT, as the input
meaning was preserved since the tokens are replaced primarily by strong match
tokens. Finally, although pre-training is commonly absent in image
classification tasks, its underlying mechanism is similar to that used in
fine-tuning NLP classification tasks, hinting at its universality. The results
were based on the BERT-6 architecture pre-trained on the Wikipedia dataset and
fine-tuned on the FewRel and DBpedia classification tasks.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型能力增强，面临的任务越来越复杂多样，可靠评估变得困难。LLM作为评估者的范式虽然提供了可扩展的解决方案，但先前工作主要关注简单场景，在复杂任务中的可靠性尚未充分研究。

Method: 构建ComplexEval挑战基准，系统性地研究和验证6种先前未探索的偏见，涵盖12个基础场景和3个高级场景，深入分析模型在复杂评估任务中的表现。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow more capable, they face increasingly
diverse and complex tasks, making reliable evaluation challenging. The paradigm
of LLMs as judges has emerged as a scalable solution, yet prior work primarily
focuses on simple settings. Their reliability in complex tasks--where
multi-faceted rubrics, unstructured reference answers, and nuanced criteria are
critical--remains understudied. In this paper, we constructed ComplexEval, a
challenge benchmark designed to systematically expose and quantify Auxiliary
Information Induced Biases. We systematically investigated and validated 6
previously unexplored biases across 12 basic and 3 advanced scenarios. Key
findings reveal: (1) all evaluated models exhibit significant susceptibility to
these biases, with bias magnitude scaling with task complexity; (2) notably,
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) show paradoxical vulnerability. Our in-depth
analysis offers crucial insights for improving the accuracy and verifiability
of evaluation signals, paving the way for more general and robust evaluation
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 沙特手语(SSL)作为过万84,000人的主要沟通方式，缺乏充足的技术资源和精确的翻译技术，导致含含者社会排斥和机会不公。现有技术主要集中在非阿拉伯手语上，阿拉伯语言的复杂性和集中式手语数据集增加了研究难度。

Method: 研究介绍了第一个连续沙特手语数据集KAU-CSSL，重点关注完整句子。提出了基于Transformer的模型，使用预训练的ResNet-18进行空间特征提取，以及结合双向LSTM的Transformer Encoder来处理时序依赖关系。

Result: 模型在依赖签名者模式下达到了99.02%的准确率，在独立签名者模式下达到了77.71%的准确率。

Conclusion: 这项研究为SSL社区提供了重要的资源和技术支持，不仅有助于改善沙特手语用户的沟通工具，还对手语识别领域做出了重要贡献。

Abstract: Sign language (SL) is an essential communication form for hearing-impaired
and deaf people, enabling engagement within the broader society. Despite its
significance, limited public awareness of SL often leads to inequitable access
to educational and professional opportunities, thereby contributing to social
exclusion, particularly in Saudi Arabia, where over 84,000 individuals depend
on Saudi Sign Language (SSL) as their primary form of communication. Although
certain technological approaches have helped to improve communication for
individuals with hearing impairments, there continues to be an urgent
requirement for more precise and dependable translation techniques, especially
for Arabic sign language variants like SSL. Most state-of-the-art solutions
have primarily focused on non-Arabic sign languages, resulting in a
considerable absence of resources dedicated to Arabic sign language,
specifically SSL. The complexity of the Arabic language and the prevalence of
isolated sign language datasets that concentrate on individual words instead of
continuous speech contribute to this issue. To address this gap, our research
represents an important step in developing SSL resources. To address this, we
introduce the first continuous Saudi Sign Language dataset called KAU-CSSL,
focusing on complete sentences to facilitate further research and enable
sophisticated recognition systems for SSL recognition and translation.
Additionally, we propose a transformer-based model, utilizing a pretrained
ResNet-18 for spatial feature extraction and a Transformer Encoder with
Bidirectional LSTM for temporal dependencies, achieving 99.02\% accuracy at
signer dependent mode and 77.71\% accuracy at signer independent mode. This
development leads the way to not only improving communication tools for the SSL
community but also making a substantial contribution to the wider field of sign
language.

learning. A model of deep learning is first applied toprocess game text and
build a world model. Next, the agent is learned through a policy gradient-based
deep reinforcement learning method to facilitate conversion from state value to
optimal policy.The enhanced agent works better in several text-based game
experiments and significantlysurpasses previous agents on game completion ratio
and win rate. Our study introduces novelunderstanding and empirical ground for
using reinforcement learning for text games and sets thestage for developing
and optimizing reinforcement learning agents for more general domains
andproblems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了MoCentric-Bench基准测试，用于评估视频多模态大语言模型在像素级视觉定位中对运动信息的理解能力，发现现有模型过度依赖静态外观线索而非真正的运动推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频多模态大语言模型在像素级视觉定位任务中主要依赖静态外观线索，缺乏对运动模式的真正理解，需要专门的基准测试来评估其运动推理能力。

Method: 提出了四种运动中心探测技术，构建了MoCentric-Bench基准测试，包含区分真假运动和运动顺序理解等任务，并建立了强单帧基线模型。

Result: 研究发现现有模型在运动理解方面存在不足，单帧基线模型性能与现有方法相当甚至更好，提出的运动中心适应技术在新基准上达到了最先进性能。

Conclusion: 需要改进视频多模态大语言模型的密集时空定位和像素级理解能力，MoCentric-Bench为未来模型的发展提供了重要基准和挑战。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive
generalization across tasks using images and text modalities. While their
extension to video has enabled tasks such as video question answering and video
captioning, their pixel-level visual grounding abilities are less studied. In
this work, we raise the pertinent question of whether motion is used in
pixel-level visual grounding and whether video MLLMs can segment objects based
on natural language expressions describing their motion patterns. We identify
the shortcomings in the current benchmarks, where we show that a single frame
can often suffice for capturing the motion referring expression without any
temporal reasoning. To address this, we introduce four motion-centric probing
techniques, particularly designed for the visual grounding task, to study video
MLLMs' ability to identify true motion from a fake one and their ability to
grasp the motion order. Consequently, we provide a motion-centric benchmark,
MoCentric-Bench. It ensures that video MLLMs are evaluated towards leveraging
the interaction between motion and language rather than being dominated by
static appearance cues emphasized in existing visual grounding datasets. We
further establish strong single-image baselines that are on par with or
outperform prior methods. Finally, we explore simple motion-centric adaptation
techniques that provide state-of-the-art performance on our MoCentric-Bench.
Our motion-centric benchmark, evaluation and findings challenge future models
to improve dense spatiotemporal grounding and pixel-level understanding within
videos. Code and datasets will be made publicly available at

Abstract: Colon cancer also known as Colorectal cancer, is one of the most malignant
types of cancer worldwide. Early-stage detection of colon cancer is highly
crucial to prevent its deterioration. This research presents a hybrid
multi-scale deep learning architecture that synergizes capsule networks, graph
attention mechanisms, transformer modules, and residual learning to advance
colon cancer classification on the Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological
Image Dataset (LC25000) dataset. The proposed model in this paper utilizes the
HG-TNet model that introduces a hybrid architecture that joins strength points
in transformers and convolutional neural networks to capture multi-scale
features in histopathological images. Mainly, a transformer branch extracts
global contextual bonds by partitioning the image into patches by
convolution-based patch embedding and then processing these patches through a
transformer encoder. Analogously, a dedicated CNN branch captures fine-grained,
local details through successive Incorporation these diverse features, combined
with a self-supervised rotation prediction objective, produce a robust
diagnostic representation that surpasses standard architectures in performance.
Results show better performance not only in accuracy or loss function but also
in these algorithms by utilizing capsule networks to preserve spatial orders
and realize how each element individually combines and forms whole structures.

Conclusion: 主动特征采集方法有潜力提升主动脉瓣狭窄诊断效率，使超声心动图评估更加高效、可扩展和个性化

Abstract: Aortic stenosis (AS) is a life-threatening condition caused by a narrowing of
the aortic valve, leading to impaired blood flow. Despite its high prevalence,
access to echocardiography (echo), the gold-standard diagnostic tool, is often
limited due to resource constraints, particularly in rural and underserved
areas. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) offers a more accessible alternative
but is restricted by operator expertise and the challenge of selecting the most
relevant imaging views. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning
(RL)-driven active video acquisition framework that dynamically selects each
patient's most informative echo videos. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
a fixed set of videos, our approach continuously evaluates whether additional
imaging is needed, optimizing both accuracy and efficiency. Tested on data from
2,572 patients, our method achieves 80.6% classification accuracy while using
only 47% of the echo videos compared to a full acquisition. These results
demonstrate the potential of active feature acquisition to enhance AS
diagnosis, making echocardiographic assessments more efficient, scalable, and
personalized. Our source code is available at:

Abstract: There is a growing interest in the development of lidar-based autonomous
mobility and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). To operate and research
on lidar data, researchers often develop code specific to application niche.
This approach leads to duplication of efforts across studies that, in many
cases, share multiple methodological steps such as data input/output (I/O),
pre/post processing, and common algorithms in multi-stage solutions. Moreover,
slight changes in data, algorithms, and/or research focus may force major
revisions in the code. To address these challenges, we present LiGuard, an
open-source software framework that allows researchers to: 1) rapidly develop
code for their lidar-based projects by providing built-in support for data I/O,
pre/post processing, and commonly used algorithms, 2) interactively
add/remove/reorder custom algorithms and adjust their parameters, and 3)
visualize results for classification, detection, segmentation, and tracking
tasks. Moreover, because it creates all the code files in structured
directories, it allows easy sharing of entire projects or even the individual
components to be reused by other researchers. The effectiveness of LiGuard is
demonstrated via case studies.

Abstract: LiDAR-based perception in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), for tasks
such as object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance segmentation, is
predominantly solved by deep neural network models which often require
large-scale labeled datasets during training to achieve generalization.
However, creating these datasets is costly. time consuming and require human
labor before the datasets are ready for training models. This hinders
scalability of the LiDAR-based perception systems in ITS. Sim2Real learning
offers scalable alternative, however, its effectiveness is dependent on the
fidelity of the source simulation(s) to real-world, in terms of environment
structure, actor dynamics, and sensor emulations. In response, this paper
introduces a rigorous and reproducible methodology for creating large-scale,
high-quality synthetic datasets using High-Fidelity Digital Twins (HiFi DTs).
The proposed workflow outlines the steps, tools, and best practices for
digitally replicating real-world environments, encompassing static geometry
modeling, road infrastructure replication, and dynamic traffic scenario
generation. Leveraging open-source and readily available resources such as
satellite imagery and OpenStreetMap data, alongside specific sensor
configurations, this paper provides practical, detailed guidance for
constructing robust synthetic environments. These environments subsequently
facilitate scalable, cost-effective, and diverse dataset generation, forming a
reliable foundation for robust Sim2Real learning.

Abstract: Sim2Real domain transfer offers a cost-effective and scalable approach for
developing LiDAR-based perception (e.g., object detection, tracking,
segmentation) in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, perception
models trained in simulation often under perform on real-world data due to
distributional shifts. To address this Sim2Real gap, this paper proposes a
high-fidelity digital twin (HiFi DT) framework that incorporates real-world
background geometry, lane-level road topology, and sensor-specific
specifications and placement. We formalize the domain adaptation challenge
underlying Sim2Real learning and present a systematic method for constructing
simulation environments that yield in-domain synthetic data. An off-the-shelf
3D object detector is trained on HiFi DT-generated synthetic data and evaluated
on real data. Our experiments show that the DT-trained model outperforms the
equivalent model trained on real data by 4.8%. To understand this gain, we
quantify distributional alignment between synthetic and real data using
multiple metrics, including Chamfer Distance (CD), Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(MMD), Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), and Fr'echet Distance (FD), at both
raw-input and latent-feature levels. Results demonstrate that HiFi DTs
substantially reduce domain shift and improve generalization across diverse
evaluation scenarios. These findings underscore the significant role of digital
twins in enabling reliable, simulation-based LiDAR perception for real-world
ITS applications.

Motivation: 解决医学影像中单一源域训练的模型在真实世界分布偏移下泛化能力差的问题，特别是在糖尿病视网膜病变分类中的域泛化挑战。

Method: 提出神经符号框架KG-DG，整合视觉transformer和专家指导的符号推理，利用临床病变本体构建结构化规则特征和视网膜血管分割，通过置信度加权集成策略与深度视觉表示融合，最小化域嵌入间的KL散度以实现高层临床语义对齐。

Conclusion: 神经符号集成是构建临床鲁棒、域不变医学AI系统的有前景范式，符号组件不仅是增强可解释性，更是有效的正则化器。

Abstract: Domain generalization remains a critical challenge in medical imaging, where
models trained on single sources often fail under real-world distribution
shifts. We propose KG-DG, a neuro-symbolic framework for diabetic retinopathy
(DR) classification that integrates vision transformers with expert-guided
symbolic reasoning to enable robust generalization across unseen domains. Our
approach leverages clinical lesion ontologies through structured, rule-based
features and retinal vessel segmentation, fusing them with deep visual
representations via a confidence-weighted integration strategy. The framework
addresses both single-domain generalization (SDG) and multi-domain
generalization (MDG) by minimizing the KL divergence between domain embeddings,
thereby enforcing alignment of high-level clinical semantics. Extensive
experiments across four public datasets (APTOS, EyePACS, Messidor-1,
Messidor-2) demonstrate significant improvements: up to a 5.2% accuracy gain in
cross-domain settings and a 6% improvement over baseline ViT models. Notably,
our symbolic-only model achieves a 63.67% average accuracy in MDG, while the
complete neuro-symbolic integration achieves the highest accuracy compared to
existing published baselines and benchmarks in challenging SDG scenarios.
Ablation studies reveal that lesion-based features (84.65% accuracy)
substantially outperform purely neural approaches, confirming that symbolic
components act as effective regularizers beyond merely enhancing
interpretability. Our findings establish neuro-symbolic integration as a
promising paradigm for building clinically robust, and domain-invariant medical
AI systems.

Abstract: Registration of serial whole-slide histopathological images (WSIs) is
critical for enabling direct comparison across diverse stains and for preparing
paired datasets in artificial intelligence (AI) workflows such as virtual
staining and biomarker prediction. While existing methods often rely on complex
deformable or deep learning approaches that are computationally intensive and
difficult to reproduce, lightweight rigid frameworks-sufficient for many
consecutive-section scenarios-remain underdeveloped. We introduce STAR (Serial
Tissue Alignment for Rigid registration), a fast and robust open-source
framework for multi-WSI alignment. STAR integrates stain-conditioned
preprocessing with a hierarchical coarse-to-fine correlation strategy, adaptive
kernel scaling, and built-in quality control, achieving reliable rigid
registration across heterogeneous tissue types and staining protocols,
including hematoxylin-eosin (H&E), special histochemical stains (e.g., PAS,
PASM, Masson's), and immunohistochemical (IHC) markers (e.g., CD31, KI67).
Evaluated on the ANHIR 2019 and ACROBAT 2022 datasets spanning multiple organs
and scanning conditions, STAR consistently produced stable alignments within
minutes per slide, demonstrating robustness to cross-stain variability and
partial tissue overlap. Beyond benchmarks, we present case studies on H&E-IHC
alignment, construction of multi-IHC panels, and typical failure modes,
underscoring both utility and limitations. Released as an open and lightweight
tool, STAR provides a reproducible baseline that lowers the barrier for
clinical adoption and enables large-scale paired data preparation for
next-generation computational pathology.

Abstract: Multimodal industrial surface defect detection (MISDD) aims to identify and
locate defect in industrial products by fusing RGB and 3D modalities. This
article focuses on modality-missing problems caused by uncertain sensors
availability in MISDD. In this context, the fusion of multiple modalities
encounters several troubles, including learning mode transformation and
information vacancy. To this end, we first propose cross-modal prompt learning,
which includes: i) the cross-modal consistency prompt serves the establishment
of information consistency of dual visual modalities; ii) the modality-specific
prompt is inserted to adapt different input patterns; iii) the missing-aware
prompt is attached to compensate for the information vacancy caused by dynamic
modalities-missing. In addition, we propose symmetric contrastive learning,
which utilizes text modality as a bridge for fusion of dual vision modalities.
Specifically, a paired antithetical text prompt is designed to generate binary
text semantics, and triple-modal contrastive pre-training is offered to
accomplish multimodal learning. Experiment results show that our proposed
method achieves 73.83% I-AUROC and 93.05% P-AUROC with a total missing rate 0.7
for RGB and 3D modalities (exceeding state-of-the-art methods 3.84% and 5.58%
respectively), and outperforms existing approaches to varying degrees under
different missing types and rates. The source code will be available at

Conclusion: 通过显式整合边缘结构先验到注意力机制中，EdgeAttNet在减少可训练参数的同时增强了空间敏感性和分割精度，适合实际部署应用。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of solar filaments in H-alpha observations is critical
for determining filament chirality, a key factor in the behavior of Coronal
Mass Ejections (CMEs). However, existing methods often fail to capture
fine-scale filament structures, particularly barbs, due to a limited ability to
model long-range dependencies and spatial detail.
  We propose EdgeAttNet, a segmentation architecture built on a U-Net backbone
by introducing a novel, learnable edge map derived directly from the input
image. This edge map is incorporated into the model by linearly transforming
the attention Key and Query matrices with the edge information, thereby guiding
the self-attention mechanism at the network's bottleneck to more effectively
capture filament boundaries and barbs. By explicitly integrating this
structural prior into the attention computations, EdgeAttNet enhances spatial
sensitivity and segmentation accuracy while reducing the number of trainable
parameters.
  Trained end-to-end, EdgeAttNet outperforms U-Net and other U-Net-based
transformer baselines on the MAGFILO dataset. It achieves higher segmentation
accuracy and significantly better recognition of filament barbs, with faster
inference performance suitable for practical deployment.

Abstract: Accurate short-horizon trajectory prediction is pivotal for safe and reliable

effectively ground their reasoning in scene dynamics and domain knowledge. To
address this challenge, this paper introduces KEPT, a knowledge-enhanced VLM

encoder, trained via self-supervised learning with hard-negative mining, with a
scalable k-means + HNSW retrieval stack that supplies scene-aligned exemplars.
Retrieved priors are embedded into chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts with explicit
planning constraints, while a triple-stage fine-tuning schedule incrementally
aligns the language head to metric spatial cues, physically feasible motion,
and temporally conditioned front-view planning. Evaluated on nuScenes dataset,
KEPT achieves state-of-the-art performance across open-loop protocols: under
NoAvg, it achieves 0.70m average L2 with a 0.21\% collision rate; under TemAvg
with lightweight ego status, it attains 0.31m average L2 and a 0.07\% collision
rate. Ablation studies show that all three fine-tuning stages contribute
complementary benefits, and that using Top-2 retrieved exemplars yields the
best accuracy-safety trade-off. The k-means-clustered HNSW index delivers
sub-millisecond retrieval latency, supporting practical deployment. These
results indicate that retrieval-augmented, CoT-guided VLMs offer a promising,
data-efficient pathway toward interpretable and trustworthy autonomous driving.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了InstaDA，一种无需训练的双代理系统，通过文本代理和图像代理的协同工作，有效扩充实例分割数据集的多样性和分布丰富性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实例分割数据注释劳动密集和类别不平衡的问题，同时充分利用现有训练数据的丰富信息，提升大语言模型与涵盛模型的深度协同能力。

Method: 设计了双代理系统：文本代理(T-Agent)通过提示重思机制迭代精炼提示并生成多样化图像；图像代理(I-Agent)基于训练图像生成新实例来丰富数据分布。两个代理都是独立自动化的工作流程。

Result: 在LVIS 1.0验证集上表现优异：相比基线提升box AP +4.0和mask AP +3.3；超过最佳模型DiverGen box AP +0.3和mask AP +0.1，在常见类别上box AP提升+0.7，mask AP在常见和频繁类别分别提升+0.2和+0.5。

Conclusion: InstaDA通过双代理协同系统有效解决了实例分割数据扩充的挑战，无需训练且自动化程度高，在性能上实现了显著提升。

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality instance segmentation data is challenging due to the
labor-intensive nature of the annotation process and significant class
imbalances within datasets. Recent studies have utilized the integration of
Copy-Paste and diffusion models to create more diverse datasets. However, these
studies often lack deep collaboration between large language models (LLMs) and
diffusion models, and underutilize the rich information within the existing
training data. To address these limitations, we propose InstaDA, a novel,
training-free Dual-Agent system designed to augment instance segmentation
datasets. First, we introduce a Text-Agent (T-Agent) that enhances data
diversity through collaboration between LLMs and diffusion models. This agent
features a novel Prompt Rethink mechanism, which iteratively refines prompts
based on the generated images. This process not only fosters collaboration but
also increases image utilization and optimizes the prompts themselves.
Additionally, we present an Image-Agent (I-Agent) aimed at enriching the
overall data distribution. This agent augments the training set by generating
new instances conditioned on the training images. To ensure practicality and
efficiency, both agents operate as independent and automated workflows,
enhancing usability. Experiments conducted on the LVIS 1.0 validation set
indicate that InstaDA achieves significant improvements, with an increase of
+4.0 in box average precision (AP) and +3.3 in mask AP compared to the
baseline. Furthermore, it outperforms the leading model, DiverGen, by +0.3 in
box AP and +0.1 in mask AP, with a notable +0.7 gain in box AP on common
categories and mask AP gains of +0.2 on common categories and +0.5 on frequent
categories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于原型的少样本医学图像分割方法通常为支持图像生成单一全局原型来匹配查询图像，忽略了类内变化，导致性能受限。

Method: 提出SPENet网络：1）多级原型生成模块同时生成全局原型和自适应数量的局部原型；2）查询引导的局部原型增强模块通过查询图像指导来精炼支持原型，减少支持-查询图像差异的负面影响。

Result: 在三个公开医学数据集上的大量实验表明，SPENet优于现有的最先进方法，取得了优越的性能。

Conclusion: SPENet通过多粒度原型生成和查询引导的原型增强，有效解决了少样本医学图像分割中的类内变化问题，显著提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation (FSMIS) aims to segment novel classes of
medical objects using only a few labeled images. Prototype-based methods have
made significant progress in addressing FSMIS. However, they typically generate
a single global prototype for the support image to match with the query image,
overlooking intra-class variations. To address this issue, we propose a
Self-guided Prototype Enhancement Network (SPENet). Specifically, we introduce
a Multi-level Prototype Generation (MPG) module, which enables
multi-granularity measurement between the support and query images by
simultaneously generating a global prototype and an adaptive number of local
prototypes. Additionally, we observe that not all local prototypes in the
support image are beneficial for matching, especially when there are
substantial discrepancies between the support and query images. To alleviate
this issue, we propose a Query-guided Local Prototype Enhancement (QLPE)
module, which adaptively refines support prototypes by incorporating guidance
from the query image, thus mitigating the negative effects of such
discrepancies. Extensive experiments on three public medical datasets
demonstrate that SPENet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods,
achieving superior performance.

TL;DR: 远感小物体分割方法SOPSeg，通过区域适配放大和边缘预测提升小物体分割精度

Motivation: 远感小物体实例分割研究缺乏，SAM模型在小物体分割上性能下降，需要专门解决方案

Method: 提出SOPSeg框架，包括区域适配放大策略、集成边缘预测的自定义解码器和面向远感应用的新提示机制

Result: SOPSeg在小物体分割上超过现有方法，并构建了基于SODA-A的小物体实例分割数据集

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了远感小物体分割挖挖，为远感任务提供了高效数据集构建方案

Abstract: Extracting small objects from remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in
various applications, including urban planning, environmental monitoring, and
disaster management. While current research primarily focuses on small object
detection, instance segmentation for small objects remains underexplored, with
no dedicated datasets available. This gap stems from the technical challenges
and high costs of pixel-level annotation for small objects. While the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) demonstrates impressive zero-shot generalization, its
performance on small-object segmentation deteriorates significantly, largely
due to the coarse 1/16 feature resolution that causes severe loss of fine
spatial details. To this end, we propose SOPSeg, a prompt-based framework
specifically designed for small object segmentation in remote sensing imagery.
It incorporates a region-adaptive magnification strategy to preserve
fine-grained details, and employs a customized decoder that integrates edge
prediction and progressive refinement for accurate boundary delineation.
Moreover, we introduce a novel prompting mechanism tailored to the oriented
bounding boxes widely adopted in remote sensing applications. SOPSeg
outperforms existing methods in small object segmentation and facilitates
efficient dataset construction for remote sensing tasks. We further construct a
comprehensive small object instance segmentation dataset based on SODA-A, and
will release both the model and dataset to support future research.

Motivation: 后处理水印技术比处理中水印更灵活，可应用于任何生成模型且允许用户为单个图像嵌入唯一水印，但需要提高其稳健性

Method: 构建集成攻击网络，结合CNN和Transformer在空间域和频域上的不同组合，在训练过程中增强水印模型的耐受性

Result: 结果显示，在空间域使用CNN基攻击网络和频域使用Transformer基攻击网络的组合能够实现最高的水印稳健性，在WAVES标准上显著提升了基线方法

Conclusion: 集成攻击网络训练能够有效提高后处理水印模型的稳健性，尤其是在重生攻击下对StegaStamp方法有18.743%的收益

Abstract: Recent studies on deep watermarking have predominantly focused on
in-processing watermarking, which integrates the watermarking process into
image generation. However, post-processing watermarking, which embeds
watermarks after image generation, offers more flexibility. It can be applied
to outputs from any generative model (e.g. GANs, diffusion models) without
needing access to the model's internal structure. It also allows users to embed
unique watermarks into individual images. Therefore, this study focuses on
post-processing watermarking and enhances its robustness by incorporating an
ensemble attack network during training. We construct various versions of
attack networks using CNN and Transformer in both spatial and frequency domains
to investigate how each combination influences the robustness of the
watermarking model. Our results demonstrate that combining a CNN-based attack
network in the spatial domain with a Transformer-based attack network in the
frequency domain yields the highest robustness in watermarking models.
Extensive evaluation on the WAVES benchmark, using average bit accuracy as the
metric, demonstrates that our ensemble attack network significantly enhances
the robustness of baseline watermarking methods under various stress tests. In
particular, for the Regeneration Attack defined in WAVES, our method improves
StegaStamp by 18.743%. The code is released

TL;DR: 该论文发现大型视觉语言模型(LVLMs)经常错误地将文本输入中缺乏视觉证据的概念视为图像的一部分，导致错误响应。研究者发现了特定的前馈网络神经元(VA神经元)能够识别视觉缺失，并基于此开发了检测模块来改进模型输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在处理视觉和文本输入时，经常错误地将文本中描述但图像中不存在的内容误认为是图像的一部分，这种错误感知导致模型产生不准确的响应。

Method: 研究发现特定的前馈网络神经元(VA神经元)能够通过独特的激活模式来识别视觉缺失。基于这些模式，开发了一个检测模块来系统分类输入标记是否具有视觉基础，并通过重新解释问题提示或在生成过程中替换检测到的缺失标记来改进输出。

Result: 实验表明，该方法有效减轻了模型错误假设文本输入具有视觉存在的倾向，并且在各种大型视觉语言模型中具有通用性。

Conclusion: 通过识别和利用VA神经元的激活模式，可以显著提高大型视觉语言模型在处理视觉-文本输入时的准确性，减少因错误感知视觉存在而产生的错误响应。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) generate contextually relevant responses
by jointly interpreting visual and textual inputs. However, our finding reveals
they often mistakenly perceive text inputs lacking visual evidence as being
part of the image, leading to erroneous responses. In light of this finding, we
probe whether LVLMs possess an internal capability to determine if textual
concepts are grounded in the image, and discover a specific subset of
Feed-Forward Network (FFN) neurons, termed Visual Absence-aware (VA) neurons,
that consistently signal the visual absence through a distinctive activation
pattern. Leveraging these patterns, we develop a detection module that
systematically classifies whether an input token is visually grounded. Guided
by its prediction, we propose a method to refine the outputs by reinterpreting
question prompts or replacing the detected absent tokens during generation.
Extensive experiments show that our method effectively mitigates the models'
tendency to falsely presume the visual presence of text input and its
generality across various LVLMs.

Conclusion: 背景语义信息对行人重识别具有重要价值，联合建模前景和背景信息的双分支框架能够有效提升模型性能，特别是在复杂遮挡场景下

Abstract: Person re-identification faces two core challenges: precisely locating the
foreground target while suppressing background noise and extracting
fine-grained features from the target region. Numerous visual-only approaches
address these issues by partitioning an image and applying attention modules,
yet they rely on costly manual annotations and struggle with complex
occlusions. Recent multimodal methods, motivated by CLIP, introduce semantic
cues to guide visual understanding. However, they focus solely on foreground
information, but overlook the potential value of background cues. Inspired by
human perception, we argue that background semantics are as important as the
foreground semantics in ReID, as humans tend to eliminate background
distractions while focusing on target appearance. Therefore, this paper
proposes an end-to-end framework that jointly models foreground and background
information within a dual-branch cross-modal feature extraction pipeline. To
help the network distinguish between the two domains, we propose an
intra-semantic alignment and inter-semantic adversarial learning strategy.
Specifically, we align visual and textual features that share the same
semantics across domains, while simultaneously penalizing similarity between
foreground and background features to enhance the network's discriminative
power. This strategy drives the model to actively suppress noisy background
regions and enhance attention toward identity-relevant foreground cues.
Comprehensive experiments on two holistic and two occluded ReID benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method, with
results that match or surpass those of current state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Accurate skin-lesion segmentation remains a key technical challenge for
computer-aided diagnosis of skin cancer. Convolutional neural networks, while
effective, are constrained by limited receptive fields and thus struggle to
model long-range dependencies. Vision Transformers capture global context, yet
their quadratic complexity and large parameter budgets hinder use on the
small-sample medical datasets common in dermatology. We introduce the
MedLiteNet, a lightweight CNN Transformer hybrid tailored for dermoscopic
segmentation that achieves high precision through hierarchical feature
extraction and multi-scale context aggregation. The encoder stacks depth-wise
Mobile Inverted Bottleneck blocks to curb computation, inserts a
bottleneck-level cross-scale token-mixing unit to exchange information between

Conclusion: 该方法通过动态条件控制有效解决了多任务激洞模型的挑战，为痴罪问题提供了通用的解决方案

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have made impressive progress in the field of
image processing, but the characteristics of constructing data distribution
pathways make it difficult to exploit the intrinsic correlation between tasks
in multi-task scenarios, which is even worse in ill-posed tasks with a lack of
training data. In addition, traditional static condition control makes it
difficult for networks to learn in multi-task scenarios with its dynamically
evolving characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic
conditional double diffusion bridge training paradigm to build a general
framework for ill-posed multi-tasks. Firstly, this paradigm decouples the
diffusion and condition generation processes, avoiding the dependence of the
diffusion model on supervised data in ill-posed tasks. Secondly, generated by
the same noise schedule, dynamic conditions are used to gradually adjust their
statistical characteristics, naturally embed time-related information, and
reduce the difficulty of network learning. We analyze the learning objectives
of the network under different conditional forms in the single-step denoising
process and compare the changes in its attention weights in the network,
demonstrating the superiority of our dynamic conditions. Taking dehazing and
visible-infrared fusion as typical ill-posed multi-task scenarios, we achieve
the best performance in multiple indicators on public datasets. The code has
been publicly released at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DCDB-D3C2.

Abstract: Bangla language consists of fifty distinct characters and many compound
characters. Several notable studies have been performed to recognize Bangla
characters, both handwritten and optical. Our approach uses transfer learning
to classify the basic, distinct, as well as compound Bangla handwritten

techniques such as 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3DCNN), Residual Neural
Network (ResNet), and MobileNet are applied to generate an end-to-end
classification of all possible standard formations of handwritten characters in
the Bangla language. The Bangla Lekha Isolated dataset, which contains 166,105

Conclusion: ADA-GAN模型通过数据增强和对抗训练的方式，显著提升了对手写草书和复杂字符的分类性能，比传统方法更加稳健有效。

Abstract: Handwritten characters can be trickier to classify due to their complex and
cursive nature compared to simple and non-cursive characters. We present an
external classifier along with a Generative Adversarial Network that can
classify highly cursive and complex characters. The generator network produces
fake handwritten character images, which are then used to augment the training
data after adding adversarially perturbed noise and achieving a confidence
score above a threshold with the discriminator network. The results show that
the accuracy of convolutional neural networks decreases as character complexity
increases, but our proposed model, ADA-GAN, remains more robust and effective
for both cursive and complex characters.

Motivation: 现有方法启发式地处理多模态大语言模型中的文本-视觉偏差和共现偏差，但未能理解不同实例间偏差水平的波动变化

Method: 使用基于梯度的自反思方法估计不同类型token（视觉、提示、先前输出）的影响，检测对象相关视觉token，并将其整合到影响感知对比解码框架中

Result: 在LLaVA-QA90上实现了高达92%的准确率提升，有效减少了幻觉现象

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外微调、模型或数据统计，就能同时缓解两种偏差类型，为多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language model are caused by the
text-visual bias and the co-occurrence bias. The former reflects an
over-reliance on text information in the decision-making process, while the
latter arises from the statistical object-pairing patterns abstracted from the
training data. Existing mitigation methods heuristically address these biases
without understanding the fluctuating bias level across the instances. We first
propose estimating the influence of respective token types (visual, prompt, and
previous outputs) using a gradient-based self-reflection method. The estimated
token influence further enables the detection of object-related visual tokens
and their integration into an influence-aware contrastive decoding framework to
mitigate both types of biases simultaneously. Our method operates without the
need for additional resources, such as costly fine-tuning, extra models, or
data statistics. Extensive experiments show it effectively reduces
hallucinations, achieving up to a 92% accuracy increase on LLaVA-QA90.

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms pose a significant clinical risk yet are difficult to
detect, delineate and model due to limited annotated 3D data. We propose a
cross-domain feature-transfer approach that leverages the latent geometric
embeddings learned by TRELLIS, a generative model trained on large-scale
non-medical 3D datasets, to augment neural networks for aneurysm analysis. By
replacing conventional point normals or mesh descriptors with TRELLIS surface
features, we systematically enhance three downstream tasks: (i) classifying
aneurysms versus healthy vessels in the Intra3D dataset, (ii) segmenting
aneurysm and vessel regions on 3D meshes, and (iii) predicting time-evolving

Abstract: Face recognition systems are robust against environmental changes and noise,
and thus may be vulnerable to illegal authentication attempts using user face
photos, such as spoofing attacks. To prevent such spoofing attacks, it is
crucial to discriminate whether the input image is a live user image or a
spoofed image prior to the face recognition process. Most existing spoofing
attack detection methods utilize deep learning, which necessitates a
substantial amount of training data. Consequently, if malicious data is
injected into a portion of the training dataset, a specific spoofing attack may
be erroneously classified as live, leading to false positives.In this paper, we
propose a novel backdoor poisoning attack method to demonstrate the latent
threat of backdoor poisoning within face anti-spoofing detection. The proposed
method enables certain spoofing attacks to bypass detection by embedding
features extracted from the spoofing attack's face image into a live face image
without inducing any perceptible visual alterations.Through experiments
conducted on public datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method
constitutes a realistic threat to existing spoofing attack detection systems.

TL;DR: CAIM-Net是一个时间序列变化检测网络，通过从变化时刻推断变化区域，确保变化区域和变化时刻结果的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法将变化区域检测和变化时刻识别作为独立任务处理，但变化区域可以从变化时刻推断出来，因此需要确保两者结果的一致性。

Method: 采用三步骤方法：差异提取与增强、粗粒度变化时刻提取、细粒度变化时刻提取与变化区域推断。使用轻量级编码器提取差异特征，边界增强卷积放大特征，时空相关性分析确定变化时刻，最后通过多尺度时间CAM模块推断变化区域。

Result: 提出的CAIM-Net网络能够同时准确检测变化区域和识别变化时刻，确保了两者结果的一致性。

Conclusion: 通过从变化时刻推断变化区域的方法，CAIM-Net有效解决了时间序列变化检测中变化区域和变化时刻结果不一致的问题，为生态系统动态监测提供了更可靠的技术手段。

Abstract: Time series change detection is a critical task for exploring ecosystem
dynamics using time series remote sensing images, because it can simultaneously
indicate where and when change occur. While deep learning has shown excellent
performance in this domain, it continues to approach change area detection and
change moment identification as distinct tasks. Given that change area can be
inferred from change moment, we propose a time series change detection network,
named CAIM-Net (Change Area Inference from Moment Network), to ensure
consistency between change area and change moment results. CAIM-Net infers
change area from change moment based on the intrinsic relationship between time
series analysis and spatial change detection. The CAIM-Net comprises three key
steps: Difference Extraction and Enhancement, Coarse Change Moment Extraction,
and Fine Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference. In the Difference
Extraction and Enhancement, a lightweight encoder with batch dimension stacking
is designed to rapidly extract difference features. Subsequently, boundary
enhancement convolution is applied to amplify these difference features. In the
Coarse Change Moment Extraction, the enhanced difference features from the
first step are used to spatiotemporal correlation analysis, and then two
distinct methods are employed to determine coarse change moments. In the Fine
Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference, a multiscale temporal Class
Activation Mapping (CAM) module first increases the weight of the
change-occurring moment from coarse change moments. Then the weighted change
moment is used to infer change area based on the fact that pixels with the
change moment must have undergone a change.

Method: 将手-物体交互建模为引力场驱动过程，提出基于引力场的扩散桥(GravityDB)方法，模拟可变形手部表面与刚性物体的交互，并整合文本语义信息指导引力场构建。

Result: 在多个数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法能有效消除穿透、确保稳定抓握、捕捉真实手部变形，生成物理合理的交互效果。

Conclusion: GravityDB方法通过引力场驱动和语义指导，成功解决了手-物体交互中的关键挑战，为精确的交互建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Existing reconstruction or hand-object pose estimation methods are capable of
producing coarse interaction states. However, due to the complex and diverse
geometry of both human hands and objects, these approaches often suffer from
interpenetration or leave noticeable gaps in regions that are supposed to be in
contact. Moreover, the surface of a real human hand undergoes non-negligible
deformations during interaction, which are difficult to capture and represent
with previous methods. To tackle these challenges, we formulate hand-object
interaction as an attraction-driven process and propose a Gravity-Field Based
Diffusion Bridge (GravityDB) to simulate interactions between a deformable hand
surface and rigid objects. Our approach effectively resolves the aforementioned
issues by generating physically plausible interactions that are free of
interpenetration, ensure stable grasping, and capture realistic hand
deformations. Furthermore, we incorporate semantic information from textual
descriptions to guide the construction of the gravitational field, enabling
more semantically meaningful interaction regions. Extensive qualitative and
quantitative experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method.

Conclusion: TADM-3D能够准确预测MRI脑部进展，通过脑龄估计器引导和双向正则化提高了时间准确性，代码将在接受后提供

Abstract: Generating realistic MRIs to accurately predict future changes in the
structure of brain is an invaluable tool for clinicians in assessing clinical
outcomes and analysing the disease progression at the patient level. However,
current existing methods present some limitations: (i) some approaches fail to
explicitly capture the relationship between structural changes and time
intervals, especially when trained on age-imbalanced datasets; (ii) others rely
only on scan interpolation, which lack clinical utility, as they generate
intermediate images between timepoints rather than future pathological
progression; and (iii) most approaches rely on 2D slice-based architectures,
thereby disregarding full 3D anatomical context, which is essential for
accurate longitudinal predictions. We propose a 3D Temporally-Aware Diffusion
Model (TADM-3D), which accurately predicts brain progression on MRI volumes. To
better model the relationship between time interval and brain changes, TADM-3D
uses a pre-trained Brain-Age Estimator (BAE) that guides the diffusion model in
the generation of MRIs that accurately reflect the expected age difference
between baseline and generated follow-up scans. Additionally, to further
improve the temporal awareness of TADM-3D, we propose the Back-In-Time
Regularisation (BITR), by training TADM-3D to predict bidirectionally from the
baseline to follow-up (forward), as well as from the follow-up to baseline
(backward). Although predicting past scans has limited clinical applications,
this regularisation helps the model generate temporally more accurate scans. We
train and evaluate TADM-3D on the OASIS-3 dataset, and we validate the
generalisation performance on an external test set from the NACC dataset. The
code will be available upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出两种新颖的损失函数（负中心线损失和简化拓扑损失）来解决生物医学分割中细长结构连续性问题，在轴突起始段3D显微镜数据上显著减少了分割不连续性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在生物医学分割任务中，细长结构的连续性和长度保持比体素级精度更重要，现有方法容易因信号丢失导致分割不连续。

Method: 使用卷积神经网络，结合新提出的负中心线损失和简化拓扑损失函数，并采用下采样和间距校正等实验设计技术。

Result: 相比标准CNN和现有拓扑感知损失，新方法显著减少了每个实例的分割不连续性数量，特别是在输入信号缺失区域，改善了实例长度计算的准确性。

Conclusion: 在损失函数设计中嵌入结构先验可以显著提高生物应用分割结果的可靠性。

Abstract: In many biomedical segmentation tasks, the preservation of elongated
structure continuity and length is more important than voxel-wise accuracy. We
propose two novel loss functions, Negative Centerline Loss and Simplified
Topology Loss, that, applied to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), help
preserve connectivity of output instances. Moreover, we discuss characteristics
of experiment design, such as downscaling and spacing correction, that help
obtain continuous segmentation masks. We evaluate our approach on a 3D
light-sheet fluorescence microscopy dataset of axon initial segments (AIS), a
task prone to discontinuity due to signal dropout. Compared to standard CNNs
and existing topology-aware losses, our methods reduce the number of
segmentation discontinuities per instance, particularly in regions with missing
input signal, resulting in improved instance length calculation in downstream
applications. Our findings demonstrate that structural priors embedded in the
loss design can significantly enhance the reliability of segmentation for
biological applications.

Abstract: Crowd density estimation is a well-known computer vision task aimed at
estimating the density distribution of people in an image. The main challenge
in this domain is the reliance on fine-grained location-level annotations,
(i.e. points placed on top of each individual) to train deep networks.
Collecting such detailed annotations is both tedious, time-consuming, and poses
a significant barrier to scalability for real-world applications. To alleviate
this burden, we present Count2Density: a novel pipeline designed to predict
meaningful density maps containing quantitative spatial information using only
count-level annotations (i.e., total number of people) during training. To
achieve this, Count2Density generates pseudo-density maps leveraging past
predictions stored in a Historical Map Bank, thereby reducing confirmation
bias. This bank is initialised using an unsupervised saliency estimator to
provide an initial spatial prior and is iteratively updated with an EMA of
predicted density maps. These pseudo-density maps are obtained by sampling
locations from estimated crowd areas using a hypergeometric distribution, with
the number of samplings determined by the count-level annotations. To further
enhance the spatial awareness of the model, we add a self-supervised
contrastive spatial regulariser to encourage similar feature representations
within crowded regions while maximising dissimilarity with background regions.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
cross-domain adaptation methods and achieves better results than recent
state-of-the-art approaches in semi-supervised settings across several
datasets. Additional analyses validate the effectiveness of each individual
component of our pipeline, confirming the ability of Count2Density to
effectively retrieve spatial information from count-level annotations and
enabling accurate subregion counting.

Abstract: Poisoning attacks pose an increasing threat to the security and robustness of
Artificial Intelligence systems in the military domain. The widespread use of
open-source datasets and pretrained models exacerbates this risk. Despite the
severity of this threat, there is limited research on the application and
detection of poisoning attacks on object detection systems. This is especially
problematic in the military domain, where attacks can have grave consequences.
In this work, we both investigate the effect of poisoning attacks on military
object detectors in practice, and the best approach to detect these attacks. To
support this research, we create a small, custom dataset featuring military
vehicles: MilCivVeh. We explore the vulnerability of military object detectors
for poisoning attacks by implementing a modified version of the BadDet attack:
a patch-based poisoning attack. We then assess its impact, finding that while a
positive attack success rate is achievable, it requires a substantial portion
of the data to be poisoned -- raising questions about its practical
applicability. To address the detection challenge, we test both specialized
poisoning detection methods and anomaly detection methods from the visual
industrial inspection domain. Since our research shows that both classes of
methods are lacking, we introduce our own patch detection method: AutoDetect, a
simple, fast, and lightweight autoencoder-based method. Our method shows
promising results in separating clean from poisoned samples using the
reconstruction error of image slices, outperforming existing methods, while
being less time- and memory-intensive. We urge that the availability of large,
representative datasets in the military domain is a prerequisite to further
evaluate risks of poisoning attacks and opportunities patch detection.

Result: 在低强度CT图像和投影数据集上，方法达到PSNR 41.87、SSIM 0.9814、RMSE 0.00236；在NIH-AAPM-Mayo数据集上达到PSNR 41.52、SSIM 0.9723、RMSE 0.0051；在COVID-19数据集上降噪后图像的分类准确率提升至94%，比无RL降噪提高4%

Conclusion: 该方法为更安全和准确的低强度CT成像提供了有前景的解决方案

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is critical for minimizing radiation
exposure, but it often leads to increased noise and reduced image quality.
Traditional denoising methods, such as iterative optimization or supervised
learning, often fail to preserve image quality. To address these challenges, we
introduce PPORLD-EDNetLDCT, a reinforcement learning-based (RL) approach with
Encoder-Decoder for LDCT. Our method utilizes a dynamic RL-based approach in
which an advanced posterior policy optimization (PPO) algorithm is used to
optimize denoising policies in real time, based on image quality feedback,
trained via a custom gym environment. The experimental results on the low dose
CT image and projection dataset demonstrate that the proposed PPORLD-EDNetLDCT
model outperforms traditional denoising techniques and other DL-based methods,
achieving a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 41.87, a structural similarity index
measure of 0.9814 and a root mean squared error of 0.00236. Moreover, in
NIH-AAPM-Mayo Clinic Low Dose CT Challenge dataset our method achived a PSNR of
41.52, SSIM of 0.9723 and RMSE of 0.0051. Furthermore, we validated the quality
of denoising using a classification task in the COVID-19 LDCT dataset, where
the images processed by our method improved the classification accuracy to
94\%, achieving 4\% higher accuracy compared to denoising without RL-based
denoising. This method offers a promising solution for safer and more accurate
LDCT imaging.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved
natural language understanding and generation, enhancing Human-Computer

Multimodal Sentiment Perception Network (MSPN) using a cross-modal fusion
transformer and supervised contrastive learning to provide emotional cues.
Additionally, we develop an emotion-aware prompt engineering strategy for
generating empathetic responses and integrate a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system and
animated avatar module for expressive interactions. \ours provides a framework
for emotion-aware agents with applications in companion robotics, social care,

Conclusion: RTGMFF通过统一文本生成和多模态融合，有效解决了fMRI诊断中的关键挑战，为脑疾病诊断提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a powerful tool for probing
brain function, yet reliable clinical diagnosis is hampered by low
signal-to-noise ratios, inter-subject variability, and the limited frequency
awareness of prevailing CNN- and Transformer-based models. Moreover, most fMRI
datasets lack textual annotations that could contextualize regional activation
and connectivity patterns. We introduce RTGMFF, a framework that unifies
automatic ROI-level text generation with multimodal feature fusion for
brain-disorder diagnosis. RTGMFF consists of three components: (i) ROI-driven
fMRI text generation deterministically condenses each subject's activation,
connectivity, age, and sex into reproducible text tokens; (ii) Hybrid
frequency-spatial encoder fuses a hierarchical wavelet-mamba branch with a
cross-scale Transformer encoder to capture frequency-domain structure alongside
long-range spatial dependencies; and (iii) Adaptive semantic alignment module
embeds the ROI token sequence and visual features in a shared space, using a
regularized cosine-similarity loss to narrow the modality gap. Extensive
experiments on the ADHD-200 and ABIDE benchmarks show that RTGMFF surpasses
current methods in diagnostic accuracy, achieving notable gains in sensitivity,
specificity, and area under the ROC curve. Code is available at

Abstract: Synthetic tumors in medical images offer controllable characteristics that
facilitate the training of machine learning models, leading to an improved
segmentation performance. However, the existing methods of tumor synthesis
yield suboptimal performances when tumor occupies a large spatial volume, such
as breast tumor segmentation in MRI with a large field-of-view (FOV), while
commonly used tumor generation methods are based on small patches. In this
paper, we propose a 3D medical diffusion model, called SynBT, to generate
high-quality breast tumor (BT) in contrast-enhanced MRI images. The proposed
model consists of a patch-to-volume autoencoder, which is able to compress the
high-resolution MRIs into compact latent space, while preserving the resolution
of volumes with large FOV. Using the obtained latent space feature vector, a
mask-conditioned diffusion model is used to synthesize breast tumors within
selected regions of breast tissue, resulting in realistic tumor appearances. We
evaluated the proposed method for a tumor segmentation task, which demonstrated
the proposed high-quality tumor synthesis method can facilitate the common
segmentation models with performance improvement of 2-3% Dice Score on a large
public dataset, and therefore provides benefits for tumor segmentation in MRI
images.

*Qihang Zhou,Shibo He,Jiangtao Yan,Wenchao Meng,Jiming Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出PointAD+框架，通过结合点云和像素级信息，将CLIP的2D异常检测能力转移到3D领域，实现了在未见对象上的零样本3D异常检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将CLIP模型在2D图像上的健壮异常检测能力扩展到3D领域，以处理高度多样化类别语义的未见对象。

Method: 提出PointAD+统一框架：1)通过点-像素对应关系建立隐式3D表征；2)通过G-聚合涵盖几何信息实现显式3D表征；3)采用层次表征学习结合隐式和显式异常语义；4)交叉层次对比对齐促进层间交互。

Result: 实验结果显示PointAD+在零样本3D异常检测任务上表现優异，能够在高度多样化类别语义的未见对象上实现全面的异常理解。

Conclusion: PointAD+通过结合隐式和显式3D表征方法，成功将CLIP的2D异常检测能力转移到3D领域，为零样本3D异常检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to transfer CLIP's robust 2D generalization
capabilities to identify 3D anomalies across unseen objects of highly diverse
class semantics. To this end, we propose a unified framework to comprehensively
detect and segment 3D anomalies by leveraging both point- and pixel-level
information. We first design PointAD, which leverages point-pixel
correspondence to represent 3D anomalies through their associated rendering
pixel representations. This approach is referred to as implicit 3D
representation, as it focuses solely on rendering pixel anomalies but neglects
the inherent spatial relationships within point clouds. Then, we propose
PointAD+ to further broaden the interpretation of 3D anomalies by introducing
explicit 3D representation, emphasizing spatial abnormality to uncover abnormal
spatial relationships. Hence, we propose G-aggregation to involve geometry
information to enable the aggregated point representations spatially aware. To
simultaneously capture rendering and spatial abnormality, PointAD+ proposes
hierarchical representation learning, incorporating implicit and explicit
anomaly semantics into hierarchical text prompts: rendering prompts for the
rendering layer and geometry prompts for the geometry layer. A cross-hierarchy
contrastive alignment is further introduced to promote the interaction between
the rendering and geometry layers, facilitating mutual anomaly learning.
Finally, PointAD+ integrates anomaly semantics from both layers to capture the
generalized anomaly semantics. During the test, PointAD+ can integrate RGB
information in a plug-and-play manner and further improve its detection
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PointAD+ in
ZS 3D anomaly detection across unseen objects with highly diverse class
semantics, achieving a holistic understanding of abnormality.

### [70] [Empowering Lightweight MLLMs with Reasoning via Long CoT SFT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03321)
*Linyu Ou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 长思维链数据对于提升轻量级多模态语言模型（MLLMs）的推理能力至关重要，先进行监督微调（SFT）阶段，再进行强化学习（RL）阶段可以进一步提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然可验证奖励的强化学习提升了大规模语言模型的推理能力，但对于参数少于70亿的轻量级多模态语言模型的效能仍未被充分探索。

Method: 研究长思维链数据在提升轻量级MLLMs推理能力中的作用，采用监督微调（SFT）和后续强化学习（RL）的两阶段方法。

Result: SFT阶段使用长思维链数据显著改善了MLLMs的推理能力，后续RL阶段可以带来额外的性能提升。

Conclusion: 使用长思维链数据的SFT阶段是开发轻量级MLLMs推理能力的关键前提条件。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards has enhanced the
reasoning of large-scale language models (LLMs), its efficacy for lightweight
multimodal language models (MLLMs) with fewer than seven billion parameters
remains underexplored. This paper investigates the role of long
Chain-of-Thought (long CoT) data in enhancing the reasoning abilities of such
MLLMs. Our findings demonstrate that Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with long CoT
data significantly improves MLLM reasoning. Furthermore, we observe that after
this initial SFT phase, MLLMs can achieve additional performance gains through
a subsequent RL stage. We conclude that a SFT stage with long CoT data is a
critical prerequisite for developing the reasoning capabilities of lightweight
MLLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合CNN-Transformer检测器，用于自动检测组织学图像中的星形胶质细胞，在ALDH1L1和GFAP染色数据集上表现优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 星形胶质细胞是重要的胶质细胞，其形态和密度变化是许多神经系统疾病的标志，但由于其复杂的分支结构和染色依赖性变异，自动化检测极具挑战性

Method: 采用混合CNN-Transformer架构，结合局部特征提取和全局上下文推理。使用热图引导的查询机制生成空间锚点，轻量级Transformer模块改善密集簇中的区分能力

Result: 在ALDH1L1和GFAP染色星形胶质细胞数据集上，模型持续优于Faster R-CNN、YOLOv11和DETR，通过FROC分析证实具有更高的敏感性和更少的假阳性

Conclusion: 混合CNN-Transformer架构在稳健的星形胶质细胞检测方面具有潜力，为先进的计算机病理学工具奠定了基础

Abstract: Astrocytes are critical glial cells whose altered morphology and density are
hallmarks of many neurological disorders. However, their intricate branching
and stain dependent variability make automated detection of histological images
a highly challenging task. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid CNN
Transformer detector that combines local feature extraction with global
contextual reasoning. A heatmap guided query mechanism generates spatially
grounded anchors for small and faint astrocytes, while a lightweight
Transformer module improves discrimination in dense clusters. Evaluated on
ALDH1L1 and GFAP stained astrocyte datasets, the model consistently
outperformed Faster R-CNN, YOLOv11 and DETR, achieving higher sensitivity with
fewer false positives, as confirmed by FROC analysis. These results highlight
the potential of hybrid CNN Transformer architectures for robust astrocyte
detection and provide a foundation for advanced computational pathology tools.

*Yixiong Jing,Cheng Zhang,Haibing Wu,Guangming Wang,Olaf Wysocki,Brian Sheil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfraDiffusion是一个零样本框架，通过虚拟相机将砖石点云转换为深度图，并使用DDNM进行恢复，显著提升了砖块级分割性能，特别适用于低光照环境下的基础设施检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低光照环境（如砖石隧道）中获取高分辨率RGB图像不切实际，而点云虽然对昏暗光照鲁棒，但通常是非结构化、稀疏且有噪声的，限制了细粒度分割。

Method: 提出InfraDiffusion框架：1）使用虚拟相机将砖石点云投影为深度图；2）采用去噪扩散零空间模型（DDNM）进行恢复；3）无需任务特定训练即可增强深度图的视觉清晰度和几何一致性；4）使用Segment Anything Model（SAM）进行砖块级分割。

Result: 在砖石桥梁和隧道点云数据集上的实验表明，该方法在砖块级分割方面取得了显著改进，证明了其在砖石资产自动化检测中的潜力。

Conclusion: InfraDiffusion为零样本点云增强提供了一种有效解决方案，特别适用于低光照环境下的基础设施监测，为自动化缺陷检测提供了可靠的技术支持。

Abstract: Point clouds are widely used for infrastructure monitoring by providing
geometric information, where segmentation is required for downstream tasks such
as defect detection. Existing research has automated semantic segmentation of
structural components, while brick-level segmentation (identifying defects such
as spalling and mortar loss) has been primarily conducted from RGB images.
However, acquiring high-resolution images is impractical in low-light
environments like masonry tunnels. Point clouds, though robust to dim lighting,
are typically unstructured, sparse, and noisy, limiting fine-grained
segmentation. We present InfraDiffusion, a zero-shot framework that projects
masonry point clouds into depth maps using virtual cameras and restores them by
adapting the Denoising Diffusion Null-space Model (DDNM). Without task-specific
training, InfraDiffusion enhances visual clarity and geometric consistency of
depth maps. Experiments on masonry bridge and tunnel point cloud datasets show
significant improvements in brick-level segmentation using the Segment Anything
Model (SAM), underscoring its potential for automated inspection of masonry
assets. Our code and data is available at

TL;DR: 提出T-CAGU框架，结合Transformer和内容自适应图神经网络，同时捕捉全局依赖和局部一致性，在高光谱解混任务中优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法难以同时表征全局依赖和局部一致性，无法兼顾长程交互和边界细节的保持

Method: 使用Transformer捕捉全局依赖，引入内容自适应图神经网络增强局部关系，集成多传播阶次动态学习图结构，采用图残差机制保持全局信息和训练稳定性

Result: 实验结果表明该方法优于最先进的现有方法

Conclusion: T-CAGU框架成功解决了高光谱解混中全局和局部特征同时建模的挑战，具有鲁棒性和优越性能

Abstract: Hyperspectral unmixing (HU) targets to decompose each mixed pixel in remote
sensing images into a set of endmembers and their corresponding abundances.
Despite significant progress in this field using deep learning, most methods
fail to simultaneously characterize global dependencies and local consistency,
making it difficult to preserve both long-range interactions and boundary
details. This letter proposes a novel transformer-guided content-adaptive graph
unmixing framework (T-CAGU), which overcomes these challenges by employing a
transformer to capture global dependencies and introducing a content-adaptive
graph neural network to enhance local relationships. Unlike previous work,
T-CAGU integrates multiple propagation orders to dynamically learn the graph
structure, ensuring robustness against noise. Furthermore, T-CAGU leverages a
graph residual mechanism to preserve global information and stabilize training.
Experimental results demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-art
methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/T-CAGU.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TinyDrop是一个无需训练、即插即用的token丢弃框架，使用轻量级视觉模型指导大型ViT模型选择性丢弃低重要性token，可减少80%计算量且精度损失极小


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers在图像分类中表现优异但计算成本高昂，需要在不损失精度的前提下降低大ViT模型的推理成本

Method: 通过轻量级视觉模型在推理时估计token重要性，指导大型ViT模型选择性丢弃低重要性token，无需修改架构且兼容各种ViT

Result: 在标准图像分类基准测试中，FLOPs减少高达80%，精度退化极小

Conclusion: 该框架具有出色的泛化能力和实际应用价值，为高效ViT分类提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve strong performance in image classification
but incur high computational costs from processing all image tokens. To reduce
inference costs in large ViTs without compromising accuracy, we propose
TinyDrop, a training-free token dropping framework guided by a lightweight
vision model. The guidance model estimates the importance of tokens while
performing inference, thereby selectively discarding low-importance tokens if
large vit models need to perform attention calculations. The framework operates
plug-and-play, requires no architectural modifications, and is compatible with
diverse ViT architectures. Evaluations on standard image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that our framework reduces FLOPs by up to 80% for ViTs
with minimal accuracy degradation, highlighting its generalization capability
and practical utility for efficient ViT-based classification.

TL;DR: 提出了D-GPTScore评估方法和CC-AlignBench基准数据集，用于评估概念定制任务，特别是在多概念场景下，能够更好地与人类偏好对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概念定制评估方法要么过于狭窄要么过于泛化，与人类偏好存在偏差，特别是在评估多概念交互时更加困难。

Method: 提出分解式GPT评分(D-GPTScore)，将评估标准分解为更细粒度的方面，并使用多模态大语言模型(MLLM)进行方面级评估。同时发布了包含单概念和多概念任务的人类偏好对齐概念定制基准(CC-AlignBench)。

Result: 该方法在基准测试中显著优于现有方法，与人类偏好的相关性更高。

Conclusion: 这项工作为概念定制评估建立了新标准，并指出了未来研究的关键挑战。

Abstract: Evaluating concept customization is challenging, as it requires a
comprehensive assessment of fidelity to generative prompts and concept images.
Moreover, evaluating multiple concepts is considerably more difficult than
evaluating a single concept, as it demands detailed assessment not only for
each individual concept but also for the interactions among concepts. While
humans can intuitively assess generated images, existing metrics often provide
either overly narrow or overly generalized evaluations, resulting in
misalignment with human preference. To address this, we propose Decomposed GPT
Score (D-GPTScore), a novel human-aligned evaluation method that decomposes
evaluation criteria into finer aspects and incorporates aspect-wise assessments
using Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Additionally, we release Human
Preference-Aligned Concept Customization Benchmark (CC-AlignBench), a benchmark
dataset containing both single- and multi-concept tasks, enabling stage-wise
evaluation across a wide difficulty range -- from individual actions to
multi-person interactions. Our method significantly outperforms existing
approaches on this benchmark, exhibiting higher correlation with human
preferences. This work establishes a new standard for evaluating concept
customization and highlights key challenges for future research. The benchmark
and associated materials are available at

TL;DR: 一种可扩展的多模态框架，通过结合复制数量变异、临床记录和组织病理图像数据，显著提升了乳腺癌分子分型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床医疗应用本质上是多模态的，但不同医疗机构和患者的模态数据可能不同。乳腺癌分子分型作为重要临床任务，能够促进个性化治疗和改善预后。

Method: 提出了一种可扩展的松耦合多模态框架，包括双重全屏图像表征方法（结合传统图像基和图象基表征）和新的多模态融合策略。

Result: 结合双重WSI表征、CNV和临床健康记录的方案，在乳腺癌分子分型任务上超过了现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅适用于乳腺癌，还可以轻松扩展到其他癌症类型，为多模态医疗应用提供了灵活可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Healthcare applications are inherently multimodal, benefiting greatly from
the integration of diverse data sources. However, the modalities available in
clinical settings can vary across different locations and patients. A key area
that stands to gain from multimodal integration is breast cancer molecular
subtyping, an important clinical task that can facilitate personalized
treatment and improve patient prognosis. In this work, we propose a scalable
and loosely-coupled multimodal framework that seamlessly integrates data from
various modalities, including copy number variation (CNV), clinical records,
and histopathology images, to enhance breast cancer subtyping. While our
primary focus is on breast cancer, our framework is designed to easily
accommodate additional modalities, offering the flexibility to scale up or down
with minimal overhead without requiring re-training of existing modalities,
making it applicable to other types of cancers as well. We introduce a
dual-based representation for whole slide images (WSIs), combining traditional
image-based and graph-based WSI representations. This novel dual approach
results in significant performance improvements. Moreover, we present a new
multimodal fusion strategy, demonstrating its ability to enhance performance
across a range of multimodal conditions. Our comprehensive results show that
integrating our dual-based WSI representation with CNV and clinical health
records, along with our pipeline and fusion strategy, outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in breast cancer subtyping.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过时间缩放状态空间模型(SSM)来解决密集视频描述中长视频处理的计算复杂性和内存限制问题，支持在线流式处理


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理密集视频描述的长视频时遇到计算复杂性和内存限制问题，且需要整个视频作为输入无法进行在线处理

Method: 提出带有转移状态的状态空间模型(SSM)，结合SSM的长序列和递归特性，解决SSM在很长上下文中无法维持状态的主要限制

Result: 方法特别适合在线流式生成描述，无需等待整个视频处理完成，在密集视频描述中使用7倍更少的FLOPs，且能够良好地缩放到更长视频

Conclusion: 该方法通过扩展SSM的时间缩放能力，有效解决了长视频处理的挑战，并为实时视频分析提供了更实用的解决方案

Abstract: Dense video captioning is a challenging video understanding task which aims
to simultaneously segment the video into a sequence of meaningful consecutive
events and to generate detailed captions to accurately describe each event.
Existing methods often encounter difficulties when working with the long videos
associated with dense video captioning, due to the computational complexity and
memory limitations. Furthermore, traditional approaches require the entire
video as input, in order to produce an answer, which precludes online
processing of the video. We address these challenges by time-scaling
State-Space Models (SSMs) to even longer sequences than before. Our approach,
State-Space Models with Transfer State, combines both the long-sequence and
recurrent properties of SSMs and addresses the main limitation of SSMs which
are otherwise not able to sustain their state for very long contexts,
effectively scaling SSMs further in time. The proposed model is particularly
suitable for generating captions on-the-fly, in an online or streaming manner,
without having to wait for the full video to be processed, which is more
beneficial in practice. When applied to dense video captioning, our approach
scales well with video lengths and uses 7x fewer FLOPs.

Motivation: 从低信噪比的EEG信号中解码视觉神经表征，通过引入文本模态来增强EEG信号与视觉内容的语义对应关系

Method: 使用适配器模块利用预训练的视觉和文本表示，提出模态一致性动态平衡策略调整各模态贡献权重，引入随机扰动正则化项增强泛化能力

Result: 在ThingsEEG数据集上，Top-1和Top-5准确率分别比之前最佳方法提高了2.0%和4.7%

Conclusion: 提出的多模态融合框架有效提升了从EEG信号解码视觉神经表征的性能，文本模态的引入显著增强了语义对齐效果

Abstract: In this work, we propose an innovative framework that integrates EEG, image,
and text data, aiming to decode visual neural representations from low
signal-to-noise ratio EEG signals. Specifically, we introduce text modality to
enhance the semantic correspondence between EEG signals and visual content.
With the explicit semantic labels provided by text, image and EEG features of
the same category can be more closely aligned with the corresponding text
representations in a shared multimodal space. To fully utilize pre-trained
visual and textual representations, we propose an adapter module that
alleviates the instability of high-dimensional representation while
facilitating the alignment and fusion of cross-modal features. Additionally, to
alleviate the imbalance in multimodal feature contributions introduced by the
textual representations, we propose a Modal Consistency Dynamic Balance (MCDB)
strategy that dynamically adjusts the contribution weights of each modality. We
further propose a stochastic perturbation regularization (SPR) term to enhance
the generalization ability of semantic perturbation-based models by introducing
dynamic Gaussian noise in the modality optimization process. The evaluation
results on the ThingsEEG dataset show that our method surpasses previous
state-of-the-art methods in both Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy metrics, improving by
2.0\% and 4.7\% respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对边缘设备内存和计算资源有限的实际场景，需要开发轻量级的道路缺陷检测方法，避免使用计算密集的集成方法和测试时增强技术。

Method: 设计双判别器生成模型，使用CLIP-based Fréchet Inception Distance损失提升合成图像质量，生成器与检测器联合训练以生成对检测器更具挑战性的样本。

Result: 在RDD2022道路缺陷检测基准测试中超越现有最优方法，参数量仅为竞争基线的20%以下，更适合边缘设备部署。

Conclusion: JTGD方法通过联合训练生成器和检测器，实现了高效轻量的道路缺陷检测，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了计算资源需求。

Abstract: Road defect detection is important for road authorities to reduce the vehicle
damage caused by road defects. Considering the practical scenarios where the
defect detectors are typically deployed on edge devices with limited memory and
computational resource, we aim at performing road defect detection without
using ensemble-based methods or test-time augmentation (TTA). To this end, we
propose to Jointly Train the image Generator and Detector for road defect
detection (dubbed as JTGD). We design the dual discriminators for the
generative model to enforce both the synthesized defect patches and overall
images to look plausible. The synthesized image quality is improved by our
proposed CLIP-based Fr\'echet Inception Distance loss. The generative model in
JTGD is trained jointly with the detector to encourage the generative model to
synthesize harder examples for the detector. Since harder synthesized images of
better quality caused by the aforesaid design are used in the data
augmentation, JTGD outperforms the state-of-the-art method in the RDD2022 road
defect detection benchmark across various countries under the condition of no
ensemble and TTA. JTGD only uses less than 20% of the number of parameters
compared with the competing baseline, which makes it more suitable for
deployment on edge devices in practice.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel parameter-efficient adaptation method for
No- Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) using visual prompts optimized
in pixel-space. Unlike full fine-tuning of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), our approach trains only 600K parameters at most (< 0.01% of the base
model), while keeping the underlying model fully frozen. During inference,
these visual prompts are combined with images via addition and processed by
mPLUG-Owl2 with the textual query "Rate the technical quality of the image."
Evaluations across distortion types (synthetic, realistic, AI-generated) on
KADID- 10k, KonIQ-10k, and AGIQA-3k demonstrate competitive performance against
full finetuned methods and specialized NR-IQA models, achieving 0.93 SRCC on
KADID-10k. To our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage pixel-space
visual prompts for NR-IQA, enabling efficient MLLM adaptation for low-level

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统一多模态模型通常依赖外部视觉组件（如ViT或视觉分词器），导致推理效率低下，特别是在高分辨率输入时。需要一种更简洁高效的架构来实现真正的统一多模态智能。

Method: 提出纯解码器Transformer架构，使用模态特定的MoE结构和单一自回归目标训练，支持动态分辨率。在LLM中引入多尺度视觉自回归机制，大幅减少解码步骤。

Result: 在多项基准测试中优于现有开源统一多模态模型，在生成、编辑和理解任务上均达到最先进性能，同时显著提升推理效率。

Conclusion: 纯自回归建模是统一多模态智能的充分且优雅的基础，OneCAT为此设定了新的性能标准，展示了该方法的强大潜力。

Abstract: We introduce OneCAT, a unified multimodal model that seamlessly integrates
understanding, generation, and editing within a novel, pure decoder-only
transformer architecture. Our framework uniquely eliminates the need for
external components such as Vision Transformers (ViT) or vision tokenizer
during inference, leading to significant efficiency gains, especially for
high-resolution inputs. This is achieved through a modality-specific
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure trained with a single autoregressive (AR)
objective, which also natively supports dynamic resolutions. Furthermore, we
pioneer a multi-scale visual autoregressive mechanism within the Large Language
Model (LLM) that drastically reduces decoding steps compared to diffusion-based
methods while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Our findings
demonstrate the powerful potential of pure autoregressive modeling as a
sufficient and elegant foundation for unified multimodal intelligence. As a
result, OneCAT sets a new performance standard, outperforming existing
open-source unified multimodal models across benchmarks for multimodal
generation, editing, and understanding.

Abstract: Benchmarking multi-object tracking and object detection model performance is
an essential step in machine learning model development, as it allows
researchers to evaluate model detection and tracker performance on
human-generated 'test' data, facilitating consistent comparisons between models
and trackers and aiding performance optimization. In this study, a novel
benchmark video dataset was developed and used to assess the performance of
several Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute object detection models and a
FathomNet single-class object detection model together with several trackers.
The dataset consists of four video sequences representing midwater and benthic
deep-sea habitats. Performance was evaluated using Higher Order Tracking
Accuracy, a metric that balances detection, localization, and association
accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available
benchmark for multi-object tracking in deep-sea video footage. We provide the
benchmark data, a clearly documented workflow for generating additional
benchmark videos, as well as example Python notebooks for computing metrics.

Abstract: Next-generation AI companions must go beyond general video understanding to
resolve spatial and temporal references in dynamic, real-world environments.
Existing Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs), while capable of
coarse-level comprehension, struggle with fine-grained, spatiotemporal
reasoning, especially when user queries rely on time-based event references for
temporal anchoring, or gestural cues for spatial anchoring to clarify object
references and positions. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce Strefer, a
synthetic instruction data generation framework designed to equip Video LLMs
with spatiotemporal referring and reasoning capabilities. Strefer produces
diverse instruction-tuning data using a data engine that pseudo-annotates
temporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and
temporal information in a structured manner, including subjects, objects, their
locations as masklets, and their action descriptions and timelines. Our
approach enhances the ability of Video LLMs to interpret spatial and temporal
references, fostering more versatile, space-time-aware reasoning essential for
real-world AI companions. Without using proprietary models, costly human
annotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental
evaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform
baselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation. Additionally,
these models exhibit enhanced space-time-aware reasoning, establishing a new
foundation for perceptually grounded, instruction-tuned Video LLMs.

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive database for research and investigation
on the effects of inheritance on handwriting. A database has been created that
can be used to answer questions such as: Is there a genetic component to
handwriting? Is handwriting inherited? Do family relationships affect
handwriting? Varieties of samples of handwritten components such as: digits,
letters, shapes and free paragraphs of 210 families including (grandparents,
parents, uncles, aunts, siblings, cousins, nephews and nieces) have been
collected using specially designed forms, and family relationships of all
writers are captured. To the best of our knowledge, no such database is
presently available. Based on comparisons and investigation of features of
handwritings of family members, similarities among their features and writing
styles are detected. Our database is freely available to the pattern
recognition community and hope it will pave the way for investigations on the
effects of inheritance and family relationships on handwritings.

TL;DR: T2I-CoReBench是一个全面的文本到图像生成基准测试，通过12维评估分类法评估模型的组合和推理能力，包含1080个复杂提示和约13500个检查问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成基准测试在评估模型的组合和推理能力方面存在明显局限性，无法全面评估这些能力，且当前基准测试局限于低场景密度和简化的一对一推理。

Method: 构建了一个包含1080个挑战性提示的综合基准测试，围绕场景图元素（实例、属性和关系）构建组合能力评估，围绕哲学推理框架（演绎、归纳和溯因）构建推理能力评估，形成12维评估分类法。每个提示都配有检查清单，包含独立的yes/no问题来精细评估每个预期元素。

Result: 对27个当前T2I模型的实验表明，在复杂高密度场景中，模型的组合能力仍然有限，而推理能力更是严重滞后，所有模型都难以从提示中推断隐含元素。

Conclusion: T2I-CoReBench提供了一个全面且复杂的基准测试，揭示了当前T2I模型在组合和推理能力方面的局限性，特别是推理能力成为关键瓶颈，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation aims to synthesize images from textual
prompts, which jointly specify what must be shown and imply what can be
inferred, thereby corresponding to two core capabilities: composition and
reasoning. However, with the emerging advances of T2I models in reasoning
beyond composition, existing benchmarks reveal clear limitations in providing
comprehensive evaluations across and within these capabilities. Meanwhile,
these advances also enable models to handle more complex prompts, whereas
current benchmarks remain limited to low scene density and simplified
one-to-one reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose T2I-CoReBench, a
comprehensive and complex benchmark that evaluates both composition and
reasoning capabilities of T2I models. To ensure comprehensiveness, we structure
composition around scene graph elements (instance, attribute, and relation) and
reasoning around the philosophical framework of inference (deductive,
inductive, and abductive), formulating a 12-dimensional evaluation taxonomy. To
increase complexity, driven by the inherent complexities of real-world
scenarios, we curate each prompt with high compositional density for
composition and multi-step inference for reasoning. We also pair each prompt
with a checklist that specifies individual yes/no questions to assess each
intended element independently to facilitate fine-grained and reliable
evaluation. In statistics, our benchmark comprises 1,080 challenging prompts
and around 13,500 checklist questions. Experiments across 27 current T2I models
reveal that their composition capability still remains limited in complex
high-density scenarios, while the reasoning capability lags even further behind
as a critical bottleneck, with all models struggling to infer implicit elements
from prompts. Our project page: https://t2i-corebench.github.io/.
