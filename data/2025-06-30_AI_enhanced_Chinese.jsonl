With LLMs as the predictor, some GLMs can interpret\nunseen tasks described by natural language, and learn from a few examples in\nthe prompts without parameter tuning, known as in-context learning (ICL).\nAnother subset of GLMs utilizes abundant training labels to enhance model\nperformance, known as instruction tuning. However, we argue that ICL on graphs\nhas effectiveness issues due to fixed parameters and efficiency issues due to\nlong context. Meanwhile, the large amount of labeled data required for\ninstruction tuning can be difficult to obtain in real-world scenarios. To this\nend, we aim to introduce an extra parameter adaptation stage that can\nefficiently tailor GLMs to an unseen graph and task with only a few labeled\nexamples, in exchange for better prediction accuracy and faster inference\nspeed. For implementation, in this paper we propose GraphLAMA method, with its\nmodel backbone and learning schemes specialized for efficient tuning and\ninference. Specifically, for model backbone, we use a graph neural network\n(GNN) with several well-designed components to transform nodes into the\nrepresentation space of LLM tokens. Task instructions can then be represented\nas a mixture of node and language tokens. In the pre-training stage, model\nparameters except the LLM will be trained with different tasks to capture\ngeneral knowledge.

However, these models still struggle with\npanoramic image generation due to unique challenges, including varying levels\nof geometric distortion and the requirement for seamless loop-consistency. To\naddress these issues while leveraging the strengths of the existing models, we\nintroduce TanDiT, a method that synthesizes panoramic scenes by generating\ngrids of tangent-plane images covering the entire 360$^\\circ$ view. Unlike\nprevious methods relying on multiple diffusion branches, TanDiT utilizes a\nunified diffusion model trained to produce these tangent-plane images\nsimultaneously within a single denoising iteration. Furthermore, we propose a\nmodel-agnostic post-processing step specifically designed to enhance global\ncoherence across the generated panoramas. To accurately assess panoramic image\nquality, we also present two specialized metrics, TangentIS and TangentFID, and\nprovide a comprehensive benchmark comprising captioned panoramic datasets and\nstandardized evaluation scripts.

Although visual\ncropping techniques seem promising, recent approaches have several limitations:\nthe need for task-specific fine-tuning, low efficiency due to uninformed\nexhaustive search, or incompatibility with efficient attention implementations.\nWe address these shortcomings by proposing a training-free visual cropping\nmethod, dubbed FOCUS, that leverages MLLM-internal representations to guide the\nsearch for the most relevant image region. This is accomplished in four steps:\nfirst, we identify the target object(s) in the VQA prompt; second, we compute\nan object relevance map using the key-value (KV) cache; third, we propose and\nrank relevant image regions based on the map; and finally, we perform the\nfine-grained VQA task using the top-ranked region. As a result of this informed\nsearch strategy, FOCUS achieves strong performance across four fine-grained VQA\ndatasets and two types of MLLMs. It outperforms three popular visual cropping\nmethods in both accuracy and efficiency, and matches the best-performing\nbaseline, ZoomEye, while requiring 3 - 6.5 x less compute.", "AI": {"tldr": "FOCUS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u88c1\u526a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528MLLM\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u6307\u5bfc\u641c\u7d22\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u56fe\u50cf\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6VQA\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u88c1\u526a\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u6216\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u6b65\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1a\u8bc6\u522b\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u8c61\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bf9\u8c61\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u56fe\u3001\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u6392\u5e8f\u76f8\u5173\u56fe\u50cf\u533a\u57df\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u6392\u540d\u6700\u9ad8\u533a\u57df\u6267\u884cVQA\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6VQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e24\u79cdMLLM\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e09\u79cd\u6d41\u884c\u89c6\u89c9\u88c1\u526a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u51cf\u5c113-6.5\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "FOCUS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u88c1\u526a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6VQA\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

AsymDSD builds on a joint embedding architecture and introduces\nseveral key design choices: an efficient asymmetric setup, disabling attention\nbetween masked queries to prevent shape leakage, multi-mask sampling, and a\npoint cloud adaptation of multi-crop.

However, current benchmarks overwhelmingly\nfocus on questions answerable through explicit visual content - actions,\nobjects & events directly observable within individual frames or short clips.\nIn contrast, creative and cinematic videos - such as movies, TV shows, and\nnarrative-driven content - employ storytelling techniques that deliberately\nomit certain depictions, requiring viewers to infer motives, causality, and\nrelationships across discontinuous frames. Humans naturally excel at such\nimplicit reasoning, seamlessly integrating information across time and context\nto construct coherent narratives. Current VideoQA systems and benchmarks fail\nto capture this essential dimension of human-like understanding. To bridge this\ngap, we present ImplicitQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed to test\nmodels on implicit reasoning. It comprises 1K meticulously annotated QA pairs\nderived from 320+ high-quality creative video clips, systematically categorized\ninto key reasoning dimensions: lateral and vertical spatial reasoning, depth\nand proximity, viewpoint and visibility, motion and trajectory, causal and\nmotivational reasoning, social interactions, physical context, and inferred\ncounting. These annotations are deliberately challenging, crafted by authors\nensuring high-quality. Our extensive evaluations on leading VideoQA models\nreveals performance degradation, underscoring their reliance on surface-level\nvisual cues and highlighting the difficulty of implicit reasoning.

First, we introduce BIOPARS-BENCH, a dataset\nfrom over 10,000 scientific articles, textbooks, and medical websites.\nBioParsQA was also introduced to evaluate the proposed model, which consists of\n5,231 Persian medical questions and answers. This study then introduces\nBioPars, a simple but accurate measure designed to assess LLMs for three main\nabilities: acquiring subject-specific knowledge, interpreting and synthesizing\nsuch knowledge, and demonstrating proper evidence.

Inspired by the observation\nthat certain CoT patterns -- e.g., ``Wait, did I miss anything?'' --\nconsistently emerge across tasks, we explore whether LRMs exhibit human-like\ncognitive habits. Building on Habits of Mind, a well-established framework of\ncognitive habits associated with successful human problem-solving, we introduce\nCogTest, a principled benchmark designed to evaluate LRMs' cognitive habits.\nCogTest includes 16 cognitive habits, each instantiated with 25 diverse tasks,\nand employs an evidence-first extraction method to ensure reliable habit\nidentification. With CogTest, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 16\nwidely used LLMs (13 LRMs and 3 non-reasoning ones). Our findings reveal that\nLRMs, unlike conventional LLMs, not only exhibit human-like habits but also\nadaptively deploy them according to different tasks. Finer-grained analyses\nfurther uncover patterns of similarity and difference in LRMs' cognitive habit\nprofiles, particularly certain inter-family similarity (e.g., Qwen-3 models and\nDeepSeek-R1). Extending the study to safety-related tasks, we observe that\ncertain habits, such as Taking Responsible Risks, are strongly associated with\nthe generation of harmful responses.

To\naddress this gap, we propose a novel LVLM framework tailored for RS\nunderstanding, incorporating two core components: Semantic-augmented\nMulti-level Alignment and Semantic-aware Expert Modeling. First, to align\nmulti-level visual features, we introduce the retrieval-based Semantic\nAugmentation Module which enriches the visual features with relevant semantics\nacross fine-to-coarse levels (e.g., object- and scene-level information). It is\ndesigned to retrieve relevant semantic cues from a RS semantic knowledge\ndatabase, followed by aggregation of semantic cues with user query and\nmulti-level visual features, resulting in semantically enriched representation\nacross multiple levels. Second, for Semantic-aware Expert Modeling, we design\nsemantic experts, where each expert is responsible for processing semantic\nrepresentation at different levels separately. This enables hierarchical\nsemantic understanding from coarse to fine levels. Evaluations across multiple\nRS tasks-including scene classification and VQA, etc.-demonstrate that the\nproposed framework achieves consistent improvements across multiple semantic\nlevels.

However, this problem\nremains under-explored in existing research. Inspired by success in the image\ndomain, we propose to exploit advances in 3D vision-language models (3D VLMs)\nfor OOD detection in point cloud objects. However, a major challenge is that\npoint cloud datasets used to pre-train 3D VLMs are drastically smaller in size\nand object diversity than their image-based counterparts. Critically, they\noften contain exclusively computer-designed synthetic objects. This leads to a\nsubstantial domain shift when the model is transferred to practical tasks\ninvolving real objects scanned from the physical environment.

We also release a new\nopen-source Chinese financial reasoning dataset covering 22 subfields to\nsupport reproducible research and further advancements in financial reasoning.\nOur experimental results reveal that LLM reasoning ability and higher-order\ncognitive ability are the core factors influencing reasoning accuracy. We also\nspecifically find that even top models still face a bottleneck with knowledge\napplication. Furthermore, our analysis shows that specialized financial LLMs\ngenerally lag behind the top general large models across multiple metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "FinEval-KR\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u72ec\u7acb\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u4e2d\u6587\u91d1\u878d\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9ad8\u9636\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u4f46\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e94\u7528\u4ecd\u662f\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u672a\u80fd\u533a\u5206LLMs\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4efb\u52a1\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u6839\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFinEval-KR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u4e2d\u6587\u91d1\u878d\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9ad8\u9636\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4f46\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e94\u7528\u4ecd\u662f\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "conclusion": "FinEval-KR\u4e3a\u91d1\u878d\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLMs\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

However, current methods neglect the influence of human\nattributes (such as age, gender, weight, and height) which are key factors\nshaping human motion patterns. This work represents a pilot exploration for\nbridging this gap. We conceptualize each motion as comprising both attribute\ninformation and action semantics, where textual descriptions align exclusively\nwith action semantics. To achieve this, a new framework inspired by Structural\nCausal Models is proposed to decouple action semantics from human attributes,\nenabling text-to-semantics prediction and attribute-controlled generation.

While recent advancements in registration methods have improved\n2D histological analysis, they often struggle to preserve critical 3D spatial\nrelationships, limiting their utility in both clinical and research\napplications.

These\nchallenges demand the deep learning models to learn robust features and\ngenerate sufficient feature descriptors. Specifically, learning\nmulti-contextual features to guarantee adequate coverage of varied object sizes\nfrom the ground scene and harnessing global-local contexts to overcome class\ndisparities challenge even profound networks. Deeper networks significantly\nlose spatial details due to gradual downsampling processes resulting in poor\nsegmentation results and coarse boundaries. This article presents a stacked\ndeep residual network (SDRNet) for semantic segmentation from FRRS images. The\nproposed framework utilizes two stacked encoder-decoder networks to harness\nlong-range semantics yet preserve spatial information and dilated residual\nblocks (DRB) between each encoder and decoder network to capture sufficient\nglobal dependencies thus improving segmentation performance. Our experimental\nresults obtained using the ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets demonstrate\nthat the SDRNet performs effectively and competitively against current DCNNs in\nsemantic segmentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5806\u53e0\u6df1\u5ea6\u6b8b\u5dee\u7f51\u7edc\uff08SDRNet\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7c7b\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u906e\u6321\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u5c3a\u5bf8\u53d8\u5316\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u9762\u4e34\u7c7b\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u906e\u6321\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u5c3a\u5bf8\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u96be\u4ee5\u63d0\u53d6\u8db3\u591f\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u5806\u53e0\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u6269\u5f20\u6b8b\u5dee\u5757\uff08DRB\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u6355\u83b7\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u8bed\u4e49\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728ISPRS Vaihingen\u548cPotsdam\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSDRNet\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6df1\u5ea6\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "conclusion": "SDRNet\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002"}}

Through analysis of four universal\nfeatures--compression, decompression, externalization, and recursion--we\ndemonstrate that just as DNA emerged as a compressed and externalized medium\nfor preserving useful cellular dynamics without containing explicit reference\nto goal-directed physical processes, LLMs preserve useful regularities of human\nculture without containing understanding of embodied human experience.\nTherefore, we argue that LLMs' significance lies not in rivaling human\nintelligence, but in providing humanity a tool for self-reflection and playful\nhypothesis-generation in a low-stakes, simulated environment. This framework\npositions LLMs as tools for cultural evolvability, enabling humanity to\ngenerate novel hypotheses about itself while maintaining the human\ninterpretation necessary to ground these hypotheses in ongoing human aesthetics\nand norms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7c7b\u6bd4\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u6587\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u7684DNA\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u538b\u7f29\u4fe1\u606f\u5b58\u50a8\u5e93\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u4eba\u7c7b\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u624d\u80fd\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49LLMs\u7684\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u81ea\u4e3b\u667a\u80fd\u6216\u7b80\u5355\u6a21\u4eff\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6587\u5316\u6f14\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u538b\u7f29\u3001\u89e3\u538b\u3001\u5916\u90e8\u5316\u548c\u9012\u5f52\u56db\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7c7b\u6bd4DNA\u7684\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u8bba\u8bc1LLMs\u7684\u6587\u5316\u4fdd\u5b58\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u4e0d\u66ff\u4ee3\u4eba\u7c7b\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u548c\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u5047\u8bbe\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u662f\u6587\u5316\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u7c7b\u89e3\u91ca\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u6587\u5316\u6839\u57fa\u3002"}}

However,\nexisting research largely overlooks a thorough and systematic comparison of\nthese models' reasoning processes and outputs, particularly regarding their\nself-reflection pattern (also termed \"Aha moment\") and the interconnections\nacross diverse domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for analyzing the\nreasoning characteristics of four cutting-edge large reasoning models (GPT-o1,\nDeepSeek-R1, Kimi-k1.5, and Grok-3) using keywords statistic and LLM-as-a-judge\nparadigm. Our approach connects their internal thinking processes with their\nfinal outputs. A diverse dataset consists of real-world scenario-based\nquestions covering logical deduction, causal inference, and multi-step\nproblem-solving. Additionally, a set of metrics is put forward to assess both\nthe coherence of reasoning and the accuracy of the outputs. The research\nresults uncover various patterns of how these models balance exploration and\nexploitation, deal with problems, and reach conclusions during the reasoning\nprocess. Through quantitative and qualitative comparisons, disparities among\nthese models are identified in aspects such as the depth of reasoning, the\nreliance on intermediate steps, and the degree of similarity between their\nthinking processes and output patterns and those of GPT-o1.

Continuous maritime\nship tracking is crucial for applications such as maritime search and rescue,\nlaw enforcement, and shipping analysis.

The former offer\nlow resolution and are susceptible to weather conditions, while the latter have\nshort filming durations and limited coverage areas, making them less suitable\nfor the real-world requirements of ship tracking.

To identify changes in news topics, existing methods\ntypically employ general Large Language Models (LLMs) to summarize relevant\ntimestamps from retrieved news. While general LLMs demonstrate capabilities in\nzero-shot news summarization and timestamp localization, they struggle with\nassessing topic relevance and understanding topic evolution. Consequently, the\nsummarized information often includes irrelevant details or inaccurate\ntimestamps. To address these issues, we propose the first large Timeline\nIntelligence Model (TIM) for open-domain TLS, which is capable of effectively\nsummarizing open-domain timelines. Specifically, we begin by presenting a\nlarge-scale TLS dataset, comprising over 1,000 news topics and more than 3,000\nannotated TLS instances. Furthermore, we propose a progressive optimization\nstrategy, which gradually enhance summarization performance. It employs\ninstruction tuning to enhance summarization and topic-irrelevant information\nfiltering capabilities.

Although autoregressive systems\nexhibit certain advantages in speech naturalness, their token-by-token\ngeneration mechanism makes it difficult to precisely control the duration of\nsynthesized speech. This is a key limitation in applications such as video\ndubbing that require strict audio-visual synchronization. This paper introduces\nIndexTTS2, which proposes a novel and autoregressive-model-friendly method for\nspeech duration control. The method supports two generation modes: one allows\nexplicit specification of the number of generated tokens for precise duration\ncontrol; the other does not require manual input and lets the model freely\ngenerate speech while preserving prosodic characteristics from the input\nprompt. Furthermore, IndexTTS2 achieves disentanglement between emotional\nexpression and speaker identity, enabling independent control of timbre and\nemotion. In the zero-shot setting, the model can perfectly reproduce the\nemotional characteristics of the input prompt. Users may also provide a\nseparate emotion prompt, even from a different speaker, allowing the model to\nreconstruct the target timbre while conveying the desired emotion.

Yet, ADNet faces three key\nlimitations: dependence on a single prototype per class, a focus on binary\nclassification, and fixed thresholds that fail to adapt to patient and organ\nvariability. To address these shortcomings, we propose the Tied Prototype Model\n(TPM), a principled reformulation of ADNet with tied prototype locations for\nforeground and background distributions. Building on its probabilistic\nfoundation, TPM naturally extends to multiple prototypes and multi-class\nsegmentation while effectively separating non-typical background features.\nNotably, both extensions lead to improved segmentation accuracy.

Furthermore, we find that the\nvisual modification is essential for these gains; purely textual strategies,\nincluding Chain-of-Thought prompting, are insufficient and can even degrade\nperformance. Our method enhances binding only with a single-query inference,\nunderscoring the importance of visual input design over purely\nlinguistically-based approaches. These findings suggest that low-level visual\nstructuring is a powerful and underexplored direction for improving\ncompositional visual reasoning and could serve as a general strategy for\nenhancing VLM performance on spatially grounded tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u4f4e\u7ea7\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982\u6c34\u5e73\u7ebf\uff09\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7ed1\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u5c06\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u8c61\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u6570\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u641c\u7d22\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u6dfb\u52a0\u4f4e\u7ea7\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982\u6c34\u5e73\u7ebf\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u914d\u5408\u9f13\u52b1\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5982GPT-4o\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u641c\u7d22\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad825.00%\uff0c\u8ba1\u6570\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad826.83%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f4e\u7ea7\u89c6\u89c9\u7ed3\u6784\u8c03\u6574\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Existing\nFSOD approaches, predominantly built on the Faster R-CNN detector, entangle\nobjectness recognition and foreground classification within shared feature\nspaces. This paradigm inherently establishes class-specific objectness criteria\nand suffers from unrepresentative novel class samples. To resolve this\nlimitation, we propose a Uniform Orthogonal Feature Space (UOFS) optimization\nframework. First, UOFS decouples the feature space into two orthogonal\ncomponents, where magnitude encodes objectness and angle encodes\nclassification. This decoupling enables transferring class-agnostic objectness\nknowledge from base classes to novel classes. Moreover, implementing the\ndisentanglement requires careful attention to two challenges: (1) Base set\nimages contain unlabeled foreground instances, causing confusion between\npotential novel class instances and backgrounds. (2) Angular optimization\ndepends exclusively on base class foreground instances, inducing overfitting of\nangular distributions to base classes. To address these challenges, we propose\na Hybrid Background Optimization (HBO) strategy: (1) Constructing a pure\nbackground base set by removing unlabeled instances in original images to\nprovide unbiased magnitude-based objectness supervision.

Additionally, they can often be efficiently simulated on\nclassical hardware, enabling quantum-inspired approaches to improve classical\nmachine learning methods. In this paper, we investigate random Bloch sphere\nrotations, which are fundamental SU(2) transformations, as a simple yet\neffective quantum-inspired data augmentation technique. Unlike conventional\naugmentations such as flipping, rotating, or cropping, quantum transformations\nlack intuitive spatial interpretations, making their application to tasks like\nimage classification less straightforward. While common quantum augmentation\nmethods rely on applying quantum models or trainable quanvolutional layers to\nclassical datasets, we focus on the direct application of small-angle Bloch\nrotations and their effect on classical data. Using the large-scale ImageNet\ndataset, we demonstrate that our quantum-inspired augmentation method improves\nimage classification performance, increasing Top-1 accuracy by 3%, Top-5\naccuracy by 2.5%, and the F$_1$ score from 8% to 12% compared to standard\nclassical augmentation methods. Finally, we examine the use of stronger unitary\naugmentations.

To further investigate structural changes, we include\npart of speech tagging in our analysis to quantify linguistic shifts over\ngrammatical categories and differentiate between word forms, like \"potential\"\nas a noun vs. as an adjective. We systematically analyze synonym groups for\nwidely discussed 'spiking words' based on frequency trends in scientific\nabstracts from PubMed. We find that entire semantic clusters often shift\ntogether, with most or all words in a group increasing in usage. This pattern\nsuggests that changes induced by Large Language Models are primarily semantic\nand pragmatic rather than purely lexical. Notably, the adjective \"important\"\nshows a significant decline, which prompted us to systematically analyze\ndecreasing lexical items.

Our approach combines a scene generation pipeline with a\nconstraint-driven optimization framework. The pipeline first extracts\nhigh-level scene information from user inputs and organizes it into a\nstructured format containing room type, furniture items, and spatial relations.\nIt then constructs a spatial relationship network to represent furniture\narrangements and generates an optimized placement sequence using a\nheuristic-based depth-first search (HDFS) algorithm to ensure layout coherence.\nTo handle complex multi-constraint scenarios, we introduce a unified constraint\nrepresentation that processes both formal specifications and natural language\ninputs, enabling flexible constraint-oriented adjustments through a\ncomprehensive action space design.

Lau"], "title": "Shape-for-Motion: Precise and Consistent Video Editing with 3D Proxy", "comment": null, "summary": "Recent advances in deep generative modeling have unlocked unprecedented\nopportunities for video synthesis. In real-world applications, however, users\noften seek tools to faithfully realize their creative editing intentions with\nprecise and consistent control. Despite the progress achieved by existing\nmethods, ensuring fine-grained alignment with user intentions remains an open\nand challenging problem. In this work, we present Shape-for-Motion, a novel\nframework that incorporates a 3D proxy for precise and consistent video\nediting. Shape-for-Motion achieves this by converting the target object in the\ninput video to a time-consistent mesh, i.e., a 3D proxy, allowing edits to be\nperformed directly on the proxy and then inferred back to the video frames. To\nsimplify the editing process, we design a novel Dual-Propagation Strategy that\nallows users to perform edits on the 3D mesh of a single frame, and the edits\nare then automatically propagated to the 3D meshes of the other frames. The 3D\nmeshes for different frames are further projected onto the 2D space to produce\nthe edited geometry and texture renderings, which serve as inputs to a\ndecoupled video diffusion model for generating edited results. Our framework\nsupports various precise and physically-consistent manipulations across the\nvideo frames, including pose editing, rotation, scaling, translation, texture\nmodification, and object composition. Our approach marks a key step toward\nhigh-quality, controllable video editing workflows. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our approach.

A straightforward solution is to adapt rule-based\nreinforcement learning for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, such methods\ntypically rely on manually curated question-answer pairs, which can be\nparticularly challenging when dealing with fine grained visual details and\ncomplex logic across images. Inspired by self-supervised visual representation\nlearning, we observe that images contain inherent constraints that can serve as\nsupervision. Based on this insight, we construct image triplets comprising two\naugmented views of the same image and a third, similar but distinct image.\nDuring training, the model is prompted to generate a reasoning process to\ncompare these images (i.e., determine same or different). Then we optimize the\nmodel with rule-based reinforcement learning.

Our analysis reveals significant differences across all four axes,\nincluding variations in language complexity between individuals and\norganizations, between profiles with sided versus moderate political views, and\nbetween those associated with higher versus lower reliability scores.\nAdditionally, profiles producing more negative and offensive content tend to\nuse more complex language, with users sharing similar political stances and\nreliability levels converging toward a common jargon. Our findings offer new\ninsights into the sociolinguistic dynamics of digital platforms and contribute\nto a deeper understanding of how language reflects ideological and social\nstructures in online spaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5206\u6790Twitter\u4e0a\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7528\u6237\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5168\u7403\u4e89\u8bae\u8bdd\u9898\uff08COVID-19\u3001COP26\u3001\u4fc4\u4e4c\u6218\u4e89\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u4f7f\u7528\u5728\u8d26\u6237\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u653f\u6cbb\u503e\u5411\u3001\u5185\u5bb9\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u590d\u6742\u6027\u53cd\u6620\u793e\u4f1a\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u6587\u672c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7528\u6237\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u8d26\u6237\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u653f\u6cbb\u503e\u5411\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u60c5\u611f\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8d1f\u9762\u548c\u653b\u51fb\u6027\u5185\u5bb9\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4e14\u653f\u6cbb\u7acb\u573a\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u7528\u6237\u4f7f\u7528\u5171\u540c\u672f\u8bed\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6570\u5b57\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u8bed\u8a00\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5728\u7ebf\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8bed\u8a00\u5982\u4f55\u53cd\u6620\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Under submission", "summary": "Inference accounts for the majority of latency and energy consumption in\nlarge language model (LLM) deployments, often exceeding 90% of total cost.\nWhile training-time efficiency has seen extensive progress, runtime\noptimization remains a key bottleneck, particularly under autoregressive\ndecoding. Existing approaches -- such as pruning, quantization, early exits,\nand speculative decoding -- often require retraining, architectural changes, or\ndisrupt decoding compatibility. We introduce QuickSilver, a modular,\ntoken-level framework that enables semantic adaptivity at inference time\nwithout altering model weights or structure. QuickSilver integrates four\nsynergistic mechanisms:\n  (i) Dynamic Token Halting, which halts computation for tokens with converged\nrepresentations; (ii) KV Cache Skipping, which selectively suppresses memory\nwrites to reduce attention overhead; and (iii) Contextual Token Fusion, which\ncollapses redundant tokens into shared paths to shrink sequence length.\n  Unlike speculative decoding or MoE routing, QuickSilver operates entirely on\nfrozen, dense models and requires no auxiliary networks. Applied to GPT-2 and\nLlama-2 across WikiText-103 and C4, QuickSilver achieves up to 39.6% FLOP\nreduction with negligible perplexity degradation (<=0.2).", "AI": {"tldr": "QuickSilver\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3001\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4ee4\u724c\u505c\u6b62\u3001KV\u7f13\u5b58\u8df3\u8fc7\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4ee4\u724c\u878d\u5408\u7b49\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u6216\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u5360\u7528\u4e86\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u67b6\u6784\u66f4\u6539\uff0cQuickSilver\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "QuickSilver\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u4ee4\u724c\u505c\u6b62\u3001KV\u7f13\u5b58\u8df3\u8fc7\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4ee4\u724c\u878d\u5408\u4e09\u79cd\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728GPT-2\u548cLlama-2\u4e0a\uff0cQuickSilver\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe39.6%\u7684FLOP\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u4e14\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u589e\u52a0\uff08\u22640.2\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "QuickSilver\u4e3aLLM\u63a8\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, most evaluations of language models\nrely on static vignettes and multiple-choice questions that fail to reflect the\ncomplexity and nuance of evidence-based medicine in real-world settings. In\nclinical practice, physicians iteratively formulate and revise diagnostic\nhypotheses, adapting each subsequent question and test to what they've just\nlearned, and weigh the evolving evidence before committing to a final\ndiagnosis. To emulate this iterative process, we introduce the Sequential\nDiagnosis Benchmark, which transforms 304 diagnostically challenging New\nEngland Journal of Medicine clinicopathological conference (NEJM-CPC) cases\ninto stepwise diagnostic encounters. A physician or AI begins with a short case\nabstract and must iteratively request additional details from a gatekeeper\nmodel that reveals findings only when explicitly queried.

When paired with OpenAI's o3 model, MAI-DxO achieves 80%\ndiagnostic accuracy--four times higher than the 20% average of generalist\nphysicians. MAI-DxO also reduces diagnostic costs by 20% compared to\nphysicians, and 70% compared to off-the-shelf o3. When configured for maximum\naccuracy, MAI-DxO achieves 85.5% accuracy. These performance gains with MAI-DxO\ngeneralize across models from the OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, Grok, DeepSeek, and\nLlama families.
