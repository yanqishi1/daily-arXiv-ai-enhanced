### [1] [Social Bias in Multilingual Language Models: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20201)
*Lance Calvin Lim Gamboa,Yue Feng,Mark Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文对多语言预训练模型中的社会偏见研究进行了系统性综述，分析了跨语言偏见评估和缓解方法的研究现状，指出了当前方法在语言多样性、文化意识和评估指标选择方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练多语言模型在处理非英语文本时表现出与英语模型相同的社会偏见，需要系统性地评估和缓解这些跨语言偏见问题。

Method: 通过系统性文献综述方法，分析多语言偏见评估和缓解技术的研究，重点关注语言多样性、文化意识、评估指标和缓解技术的选择。

Result: 研究发现当前研究存在方法学设计选择上的差距（如偏好某些语言、多语言缓解实验稀缺），同时记录了跨语言和文化适应偏见基准时的常见问题和解决方案。

Conclusion: 基于研究发现，提出了未来研究方向，旨在增强多语言偏见文献的包容性、跨文化适当性以及与最先进NLP进展的一致性。

Abstract: Pretrained multilingual models exhibit the same social bias as models
processing English texts. This systematic review analyzes emerging research
that extends bias evaluation and mitigation approaches into multilingual and
non-English contexts. We examine these studies with respect to linguistic
diversity, cultural awareness, and their choice of evaluation metrics and
mitigation techniques. Our survey illuminates gaps in the field's dominant
methodological design choices (e.g., preference for certain languages, scarcity
of multilingual mitigation experiments) while cataloging common issues
encountered and solutions implemented in adapting bias benchmarks across
languages and cultures. Drawing from the implications of our findings, we chart
directions for future research that can reinforce the multilingual bias
literature's inclusivity, cross-cultural appropriateness, and alignment with
state-of-the-art NLP advancements.

### [2] [Prompting Strategies for Language Model-Based Item Generation in K-12 Education: Bridging the Gap Between Small and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20217)
*Mohammad Amini,Babak Ahmadi,Xiaomeng Xiong,Yilin Zhang,Christopher Qiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这研究探索了使用语言模型自动生成多选题进行语言能力评估的方法，通过结构化提示策略和精细调整提升中型模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少手工测试开发的成本和不一致性，尝试通过自动生成方式提高K-12语言评估的效率和可扩展性。

Method: 采用两种方法：比较精细调整的中型模型(Gemma, 2B)与未调整的大型模型(GPT-3.5, 175B)；评估七种结构化提示策略，包括零样本、少样本、思维链、角色基础等。使用自动指标和专家评分进行评估。

Result: 结构化提示特别是思维链与序列设计组合显著提高了Gemma的输出质量。Gemma在构建对齐和教学适宜性方面通常比GPT-3.5的零样本响应更好。提示设计在中型模型性能中起关键作用。

Conclusion: 结构化提示和高效精细调整可以在有限数据条件下提升中型模型的自动生成能力。结合自动指标、专家判断和大模型模拟的方法能确保与评估目标的对齐，为K-12语言评估提供了实用可扩展的工作流程。

Abstract: This study explores automatic generation (AIG) using language models to
create multiple choice questions (MCQs) for morphological assessment, aiming to
reduce the cost and inconsistency of manual test development. The study used a
two-fold approach. First, we compared a fine-tuned medium model (Gemma, 2B)
with a larger untuned one (GPT-3.5, 175B). Second, we evaluated seven
structured prompting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot,
chain-of-thought, role-based, sequential, and combinations. Generated items
were assessed using automated metrics and expert scoring across five
dimensions. We also used GPT-4.1, trained on expert-rated samples, to simulate
human scoring at scale. Results show that structured prompting, especially
strategies combining chain-of-thought and sequential design, significantly
improved Gemma's outputs. Gemma generally produced more construct-aligned and
instructionally appropriate items than GPT-3.5's zero-shot responses, with
prompt design playing a key role in mid-size model performance. This study
demonstrates that structured prompting and efficient fine-tuning can enhance
midsized models for AIG under limited data conditions. We highlight the value
of combining automated metrics, expert judgment, and large-model simulation to
ensure alignment with assessment goals. The proposed workflow offers a
practical and scalable way to develop and validate language assessment items
for K-12.

### [3] [Integrating SystemC TLM into FMI 3.0 Co-Simulations with an Open-Source Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20223)
*Andrei Mihai Albu,Giovanni Pollo,Alessio Burrello,Daniele Jahier Pagliari,Cristian Tesconi,Alessandra Neri,Dario Soldi,Fabio Autieri,Sara Vinco*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种将SystemC TLM模型集成到FMI 3.0协同仿真框架的开源方法，通过封装为FMU实现跨域协同仿真。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着信息物理系统复杂度的增加，特别是汽车应用中，需要高效的建模和跨域协同仿真技术。SystemC TLM虽然支持硬件/软件协同设计，但与其他工程领域模型的互操作性有限。

Method: 将SystemC TLM组件封装为FMI 3.0协同仿真功能模型单元(FMU)，开发轻量级开源工具链，解决时间同步和数据交换等关键技术挑战。

Result: 通过代表性案例研究证明了该集成方法的可行性和有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了SystemC TLM模型与异构仿真环境的标准化无缝集成，为跨域协同仿真提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The growing complexity of cyber-physical systems, particularly in automotive
applications, has increased the demand for efficient modeling and cross-domain
co-simulation techniques. While SystemC Transaction-Level Modeling (TLM)
enables effective hardware/software co-design, its limited interoperability
with models from other engineering domains poses integration challenges. This
paper presents a fully open-source methodology for integrating SystemC TLM
models into Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI)-based co-simulation workflows.
By encapsulating SystemC TLM components as FMI 3.0 Co Simulation Functional
Mock-up Units (FMUs), the proposed approach facilitates seamless, standardized
integration across heterogeneous simulation environments. We introduce a
lightweight open-source toolchain, address key technical challenges such as
time synchronization and data exchange, and demonstrate the feasibility and
effectiveness of the integration through representative case studies.

### [4] [Can Compact Language Models Search Like Agents? Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization for Preserving Agentic RAG Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20324)
*Rikuto Kotoge,Mai Nishimura,Jiaxin Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DGPO方法，通过教师演示的冷启动初始化和持续教师指导，解决小型语言模型在强化学习训练中奖励稀疏和训练不稳定的问题，使紧凑模型能够实现复杂的代理搜索行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型语言模型（如0.5B参数）由于推理能力差，在强化学习训练中面临奖励稀疏和训练不稳定的问题，难以实现代理式RAG行为。

Method: 提出Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization (DGPO)，包括从教师演示进行冷启动初始化，以及在策略优化过程中提供持续的教师指导。

Result: DGPO使紧凑模型能够实现复杂的代理搜索行为，在某些情况下甚至超越了更大的教师模型，使得在计算资源受限环境中实现代理式RAG成为可能。

Conclusion: DGPO方法有效解决了小型语言模型在强化学习训练中的挑战，通过引入ARC细粒度评估指标，证明了该方法在资源受限环境中的可行性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a post-training approach to elicit
agentic RAG behaviors such as search and planning from language models.
However, compact language models (e.g., 0.5B parameters) struggle due to poor
reasoning ability, resulting in sparse rewards and unstable training. To
overcome these difficulties, we propose Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization
(DGPO), which addresses the challenges through cold-start initialization from
teacher demonstrations and continuous teacher guidance during policy
optimization. To systematically evaluate our approach, we introduce Agentic RAG
Capabilities (ARC), a fine-grained metric analyzing reasoning, search
coordination, and response synthesis. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that DGPO enables compact models to achieve sophisticated agentic search
behaviors, even outperforming the larger teacher model in some cases. DGPO
makes agentic RAG feasible in computing resource-constrained environments.

### [5] [GUARD: Guideline Upholding Test through Adaptive Role-play and Jailbreak Diagnostics for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20325)
*Haibo Jin,Ruoxi Chen,Peiyan Zhang,Andy Zhou,Yang Zhang,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GUARD是一种将政府AI伦理指南转化为可操作测试问题的方法，通过自动生成违反指南的问题来评估LLM合规性，并引入越狱诊断来识别潜在安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在各领域的广泛应用，其可能生成有害内容引发了社会担忧。政府发布的伦理指南多为高层级要求，缺乏具体可操作的测试方法，需要将其转化为实际测试问题来验证LLM合规性。

Method: GUARD方法通过自动生成违反政府指南的问题来测试LLM响应合规性。对于不直接违反指南的响应，引入GUARD-JD（越狱诊断）创建场景来诱发不道德或违规响应，识别可能绕过内置安全机制的情况。最终生成合规报告。

Result: 在7个LLM（包括Vicuna-13B、LongChat-7B、Llama2-7B、Llama-3-8B、GPT-3.5、GPT-4、GPT-4o和Claude-3.7）上实证验证了GUARD的有效性，测试了三个政府指南的合规性并进行了越狱诊断。GUARD-JD还可迁移到视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: GUARD提供了一种将高层级伦理指南转化为具体测试问题的方法，能够有效评估LLM的合规性并识别潜在安全漏洞，有助于促进可靠的LLM应用开发。

Abstract: As Large Language Models become increasingly integral to various domains,
their potential to generate harmful responses has prompted significant societal
and regulatory concerns. In response, governments have issued ethics guidelines
to promote the development of trustworthy AI. However, these guidelines are
typically high-level demands for developers and testers, leaving a gap in
translating them into actionable testing questions to verify LLM compliance.
  To address this challenge, we introduce GUARD (\textbf{G}uideline
\textbf{U}pholding Test through \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}ole-play and
Jailbreak \textbf{D}iagnostics), a testing method designed to operationalize
guidelines into specific guideline-violating questions that assess LLM
adherence. To implement this, GUARD uses automated generation of
guideline-violating questions based on government-issued guidelines, thereby
testing whether responses comply with these guidelines. When responses directly
violate guidelines, GUARD reports inconsistencies. Furthermore, for responses
that do not directly violate guidelines, GUARD integrates the concept of
``jailbreaks'' to diagnostics, named GUARD-JD, which creates scenarios that
provoke unethical or guideline-violating responses, effectively identifying
potential scenarios that could bypass built-in safety mechanisms. Our method
finally culminates in a compliance report, delineating the extent of adherence
and highlighting any violations.
  We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on seven LLMs,
including Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, Llama2-7B, Llama-3-8B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4,
GPT-4o, and Claude-3.7, by testing compliance under three government-issued
guidelines and conducting jailbreak diagnostics. Additionally, GUARD-JD can
transfer jailbreak diagnostics to vision-language models, demonstrating its
usage in promoting reliable LLM-based applications.

### [6] [Joint Enhancement of Relational Reasoning for Long-Context LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20351)
*Zhirui Chen,Wei Shen,Jiashui Huang,Ling Shao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: JERR是一个基于图推理的框架，通过摘要提取、图构建和关系推理三个组件，帮助大语言模型更好地处理长上下文和复杂推理任务，在ROUGE和F1指标上优于所有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在处理长上下文时存在内存限制和复杂任务处理困难的问题，同时缺乏透明度且容易产生幻觉，需要新的解决方案来提升长文本理解能力。

Method: JERR框架包含三个关键组件：1）策略性分块提取摘要；2）构建有向无环图（DAG）解决冗余问题；3）集成蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）来导航复杂推理路径。

Result: 实验结果表明，JERR在ROUGE和F1指标上持续优于所有基线方法，在LLM-Rater评估中获得最高分数。

Conclusion: JERR为大语言模型处理扩展上下文和复杂推理任务提供了一种新颖的解决方案，显著提高了可靠性和透明度。

Abstract: Despite significant progress, large language models (LLMs) still struggle
with long contexts due to memory limitations and their inability to tackle
complex and long-context tasks. Additionally, LLMs often suffer from a lack of
transparency and are prone to producing hallucinations. To address these
challenges, we propose \textbf{JERR}, a novel framework designed to enhance
long-context comprehension via graph-based reasoning in LLMs. JERR integrates
three key components: synopsis extraction, graph construction, and relational
reasoning. First, synopsis is extracted by chunking text strategically,
allowing the model to summarize and understand information more efficiently.
Second, we build a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to resolve redundancy, ensuring
logical consistency and clarity. Finally, we incorporate Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to help the model navigate complex reasoning paths, ensuring more
accurate and interpretable outputs. This framework provides a novel solution
that enables LLMs to handle extended contexts and complex reasoning tasks with
improved reliability and transparency. Experimental results show that JERR
consistently outperforms all baselines on the ROUGE and F1 metrics, achieving
the highest scores on the LLM-Rater evaluation.

### [7] [Graph-R1: Unleashing LLM Reasoning with NP-Hard Graph Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20373)
*Yuyao Wang,Bowen Liu,Jianheng Tang,Nuo Chen,Yuhan Li,Qifan Zhang,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出使用NP难图论问题作为合成训练资源，通过两阶段训练框架（SFT+RL）提升LLM的长链推理能力，Graph-R1-7B模型在多个领域表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前长链推理能力的发展依赖于高成本的人工精检数据集，需要找到可扩展的替代方案

Method: 使用NP难图论问题作为合成训练资源，采用两阶段训练：1）基于拒绝采样的长链推理有监督微调 2）使用细粒度奖励设计的强化学习

Result: Graph-R1-7B模型在数学、编程、STEM和逻辑领域都表现出强大的泛化能力，在NP难图论问题上超过QwQ-32B的准确性和推理效率

Conclusion: NP难图论问题是一种有效且可扩展的资源，为LLM的长链推理能力进阶打开了新的前沿

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress on complex reasoning tasks, largely enabled by their long
chain-of-thought (Long CoT) capabilities. However, developing these Long CoT
behaviors relies heavily on post-training with high-quality datasets, which are
typically costly and human-curated (e.g., mathematics and code), leaving
scalable alternatives unexplored. In this work, we introduce NP-hard (NPH)
graph problems as a novel synthetic training corpus, as they inherently require
deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and reflective strategies, which are
core characteristics of Long CoT reasoning. Building on this insight, we
develop a two-stage post-training framework: (i) Long CoT Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on rejection-sampled NPH graph instances, which substantially
enhances reasoning depth, and (ii) Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a
fine-grained reward design, which sharpens reasoning efficiency. Our flagship
model, Graph-R1-7B, demonstrates strong generalization across mathematics,
coding, STEM, and logic, and surpasses QwQ-32B on NPH graph problems in both
accuracy and reasoning efficiency. These results position NPH graph problems as
an effective and scalable resource for advancing Long CoT reasoning in LLMs,
opening a new frontier for LLM post-training. Our implementation is available
at https://github.com/Graph-Reasoner/Graph-R1, with models and datasets hosted
in our Hugging Face collection HKUST-DSAIL/Graph-R1.

### [8] [CAPE: Context-Aware Personality Evaluation Framework for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20385)
*Jivnesh Sandhan,Fei Cheng,Tushar Sandhan,Yugo Murawaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个上下文感知人格评估框架CAPE，通过引入对话历史来评估大语言模型的人格特质，发现上下文能提高回答一致性但也会导致人格偏移，不同模型对上下文依赖程度不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心理测量测试采用无上下文方式孤立回答问题，忽略了真实对话中历史对话对回答的影响，需要开发能够考虑对话历史的评估框架。

Method: 提出CAPE框架，引入先前的对话交互作为上下文，设计新指标来量化LLM回答的一致性，在7个LLM上进行实验分析。

Result: 对话历史通过上下文学习提高了回答一致性，但也导致人格偏移；GPT模型对问题顺序稳健，而Gemini和Llama对上下文敏感；GPT的回答基于内在人格特质和先前交互，而其他模型更依赖先前交互。

Conclusion: 上下文感知评估能更真实地反映LLM在对话场景中的行为特征，角色扮演代理的上下文依赖人格偏移提高了回答一致性并与人类判断更一致。

Abstract: Psychometric tests, traditionally used to assess humans, are now being
applied to Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate their behavioral traits.
However, existing studies follow a context-free approach, answering each
question in isolation to avoid contextual influence. We term this the Disney
World test, an artificial setting that ignores real-world applications, where
conversational history shapes responses. To bridge this gap, we propose the
first Context-Aware Personality Evaluation (CAPE) framework for LLMs,
incorporating prior conversational interactions. To thoroughly analyze the
influence of context, we introduce novel metrics to quantify the consistency of
LLM responses, a fundamental trait in human behavior.
  Our exhaustive experiments on 7 LLMs reveal that conversational history
enhances response consistency via in-context learning but also induces
personality shifts, with GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-Turbo exhibiting extreme
deviations. While GPT models are robust to question ordering, Gemini-1.5-Flash
and Llama-8B display significant sensitivity. Moreover, GPT models response
stem from their intrinsic personality traits as well as prior interactions,
whereas Gemini-1.5-Flash and Llama--8B heavily depend on prior interactions.
Finally, applying our framework to Role Playing Agents (RPAs) shows
context-dependent personality shifts improve response consistency and better
align with human judgments. Our code and datasets are publicly available at:

### [9] [Measuring Reasoning Utility in LLMs via Conditional Entropy Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20395)
*Xu Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过条件熵分析发现，推理步骤中熵值下降与正确答案相关，而熵值平稳或上升往往导致错误答案，错误推理路径通常更长，为设计高效推理管道提供基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型依赖生成中间推理步骤来提高准确性，但缺乏对推理步骤效用如何影响最终答案正确性的研究。由于自回归生成的随机性，生成更多上下文并不能保证答案置信度的提升。

Method: 在MATH数据集上进行oracle研究，使用Qwen2.5-32B和GPT-4o生成推理链，然后用Qwen3-8B量化这些推理链对最终准确性的效用。通过条件熵（词汇表上的期望负对数似然）逐步测量模型对答案跨度Y的不确定性。

Result: 结果显示清晰的模式：随着步骤进行而下降的条件熵与正确答案强相关，而平稳或上升的熵往往导致错误答案。错误推理路径通常比正确路径更长，表明更长的推理不一定产生更好结果。

Conclusion: 这些发现为未来设计高效推理管道提供了基础，可以早期检测和避免无效推理，优化大语言模型的推理过程。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) often rely on generating
intermediate reasoning steps to enhance accuracy. However, little work has
examined how reasoning utility contributes to the final answer's correctness.
Due to the stochastic nature of autoregressive generation, generating more
context does not guarantee increased confidence in the answer. If we could
predict, during generation, whether a reasoning step will be useful, we could
stop early or prune ineffective steps, avoiding distractions in the final
decision.
  We present an oracle study on MATH dataset, using Qwen2.5-32B and GPT-4o to
generate reasoning chains, and then employing a separate model (Qwen3-8B) to
quantify the utility of these chains for final accuracy. Specifically, we
measure the model's uncertainty on the answer span Y at each reasoning step
using conditional entropy (expected negative log-likelihood over the
vocabulary) with context expanding step by step. Our results show a clear
pattern: conditional entropy that decreases over steps is strongly associated
with correct answers, whereas flat or increasing entropy often results in wrong
answers. We also corroborate that incorrect reasoning paths tend to be longer
than correct ones, suggesting that longer reasoning does not necessarily yield
better outcomes. These findings serve as a foundation to inspire future work on
designing efficient reasoning pipelines that detect and avoid unproductive
reasoning early.

across competing AI text-to-app tools through expert pairwise comparison.
Spanning 10 tools, 30 prompts, 300 generated sites, and \textit{4000+} expert
judgments, UI-Bench ranks systems with a TrueSkill-derived model that yields

### [11] [DentalBench: Benchmarking and Advancing LLMs Capability for Bilingual Dentistry Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20416)
*Hengchuan Zhu,Yihuan Xu,Yichen Li,Zijie Meng,Zuozhu Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DentalBench是首个针对牙科领域的双语基准测试，包含问答数据集和语料库，评估显示现有LLMs在牙科专业知识方面存在显著差距，领域适应能显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在通用医学基准上表现良好，但在需要深度专业知识的牙科等专业医学领域能力尚未充分探索，缺乏针对性的评估资源。

Method: 构建DentalBench双语基准：1）DentalQA问答基准（36,597个问题，4任务16子领域）；2）DentalCorpus语料库（3.37亿token）。评估14个LLM，并进行领域适应实验。

Result: 评估发现不同模型在任务类型和语言上存在显著性能差距。领域适应（特别是Qwen-2.5-3B）大幅提升模型性能，尤其在知识密集和术语相关任务上。

Conclusion: 领域特定基准对于开发可信有效的医疗应用LLM至关重要，领域适应能显著提升专业医学领域的模型性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and medical LLMs (Med-LLMs)
have demonstrated strong performance on general medical benchmarks. However,
their capabilities in specialized medical fields, such as dentistry which
require deeper domain-specific knowledge, remain underexplored due to the lack
of targeted evaluation resources. In this paper, we introduce DentalBench, the
first comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to evaluate and advance LLMs
in the dental domain. DentalBench consists of two main components: DentalQA, an
English-Chinese question-answering (QA) benchmark with 36,597 questions
spanning 4 tasks and 16 dental subfields; and DentalCorpus, a large-scale,
high-quality corpus with 337.35 million tokens curated for dental domain
adaptation, supporting both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We evaluate 14 LLMs, covering
proprietary, open-source, and medical-specific models, and reveal significant
performance gaps across task types and languages. Further experiments with
Qwen-2.5-3B demonstrate that domain adaptation substantially improves model
performance, particularly on knowledge-intensive and terminology-focused tasks,
and highlight the importance of domain-specific benchmarks for developing
trustworthy and effective LLMs tailored to healthcare applications.

### [12] [KG-CQR: Leveraging Structured Relation Representations in Knowledge Graphs for Contextual Query Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20417)
*Chi Minh Bui,Ngoc Mai Thieu,Van Vinh Nguyen,Json J. Jung,Khac-Hoai Nam Bui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KG-CQR是一个新颖的知识图谱增强检索框架，通过提取和补全相关KG子图来丰富查询上下文，在RAG系统中显著提升检索性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要解决语料库级别的上下文丢失问题，但缺乏对复杂查询的语义丰富表示。知识图谱与LLMs的集成为改进RAG检索阶段提供了重要潜力

Method: KG-CQR包含子图提取、补全和上下文生成三个模块，作为模型无关的流水线运行，无需额外训练即可在不同规模的LLMs上扩展

Result: 在RAGBench和MultiHop-RAG数据集上，KG-CQR相比强基线模型在mAP上提升4-6%，Recall@25提升2-3%。在多跳问答等挑战性任务中检索效果持续优于现有基线

Conclusion: KG-CQR通过结构化关系表示和知识图谱子图补全，有效增强了查询的上下文表示，显著提升了RAG系统的检索性能，具有良好的可扩展性和实用性

Abstract: The integration of knowledge graphs (KGs) with large language models (LLMs)
offers significant potential to improve the retrieval phase of
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. In this study, we propose KG-CQR,
a novel framework for Contextual Query Retrieval (CQR) that enhances the
retrieval phase by enriching the contextual representation of complex input
queries using a corpus-centric KG. Unlike existing methods that primarily
address corpus-level context loss, KG-CQR focuses on query enrichment through
structured relation representations, extracting and completing relevant KG
subgraphs to generate semantically rich query contexts. Comprising subgraph
extraction, completion, and contextual generation modules, KG-CQR operates as a
model-agnostic pipeline, ensuring scalability across LLMs of varying sizes
without additional training. Experimental results on RAGBench and MultiHop-RAG
datasets demonstrate KG-CQR's superior performance, achieving a 4-6%
improvement in mAP and a 2-3% improvement in Recall@25 over strong baseline
models. Furthermore, evaluations on challenging RAG tasks such as multi-hop
question answering show that, by incorporating KG-CQR, the performance
consistently outperforms the existing baseline in terms of retrieval
effectiveness

*Feng Zhang,Chengjie Pang,Yuehan Zhang,Chenyu Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发专门用于民航维修领域的工业级大语言模型评测基准，用于评估模型在专业知识和复杂推理方面的能力缺口，并支持RAG系统优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 民航维修领域缺乏专业的LLM评估工具，当前评测主要集中在数学和编码推理任务。

Method: 开发专门的民航维修评测基准，用于测试LLM在领域知识和复杂推理方面的能力，并评估现有知名向量嵌入模型和LLM。

Result: 证明了该基准在民航维修领域评估模型性能的有效性，并开源了评测基准和代码。

Conclusion: 该工作填补了LLM评估在专业领域的空白，为民航维修领域的LLM发展提供了基础支持。

Abstract: Civil aviation maintenance is a domain characterized by stringent industry
standards. Within this field, maintenance procedures and troubleshooting
represent critical, knowledge-intensive tasks that require sophisticated
reasoning. To address the lack of specialized evaluation tools for large
language models (LLMs) in this vertical, we propose and develop an
industrial-grade benchmark specifically designed for civil aviation
maintenance. This benchmark serves a dual purpose: It provides a standardized
tool to measure LLM capabilities within civil aviation maintenance, identifying
specific gaps in domain knowledge and complex reasoning. By pinpointing these
deficiencies, the benchmark establishes a foundation for targeted improvement
efforts (e.g., domain-specific fine-tuning, RAG optimization, or specialized
prompt engineering), ultimately facilitating progress toward more intelligent
solutions within civil aviation maintenance. Our work addresses a significant
gap in the current LLM evaluation, which primarily focuses on mathematical and
coding reasoning tasks. In addition, given that Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems are currently the dominant solutions in practical applications ,
we leverage this benchmark to evaluate existing well-known vector embedding
models and LLMs for civil aviation maintenance scenarios. Through experimental
exploration and analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark in
assessing model performance within this domain, and we open-source this
evaluation benchmark and code to foster further research and
development:https://github.com/CamBenchmark/cambenchmark

Method: 使用案例推理(CBR)方法，结合TF-IDF进行文本向量化处理，采用余弦相似度计算标题间的相似性值，支持标题和关键词两种搜索方式

Result: 在705个实践工作标题的测试中，系统在两个测试阶段都表现良好：第一阶段搜索现有标题，第二阶段随机化标题搜索，结果第二阶段获得了相同数量的匹配标题和更高的平均匹配分数

Conclusion: 该系统能够有效搜索实践工作标题，TF-IDF和余弦相似度的结合在案例推理中表现优异，为实践工作标题搜索提供了可靠的解决方案

Abstract: Case Base Reasoning (CBR) is a case solving technique based on experience in
cases that have occurred before with the highest similarity. CBR is used to
search for practical work titles. TF-IDF is applied to process the
vectorization of each practical work title word and Cosine Similarity for the
calculation of similarity values. This system can search either in the form of
titles or keywords. The output of the system is the title of practical work and
the match value of each title. Based on the test results using 705 practical
work titles, testing was carried out with five titles and carried out in two
stages. The first stage searches with existing titles and the second stage
randomizes the title from the first stage. And the results obtained in the
second stage are the same number of titles found and the highest average match
score.

TL;DR: MCP-Bench是一个基于Model Context Protocol的基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在真实多步骤任务中的工具使用能力，包含28个MCP服务器和250个跨领域工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的API基准测试主要依赖显式工具规范、浅层工作流程和孤立领域操作，无法充分评估LLM在模糊指令下检索工具、规划多跳执行轨迹、协调跨域工作流等关键能力。

Method: 基于MCP协议构建基准，连接28个真实MCP服务器，涵盖金融、旅行、科学计算等领域的250个工具，设计多步骤任务测试工具理解、规划执行和跨域协调能力。

Result: 对20个先进LLM的实验揭示了在MCP-Bench上的持续挑战，表明现有模型在真实多步骤工具使用任务中仍存在显著困难。

Conclusion: MCP-Bench为评估LLM在真实复杂任务中的工具使用能力提供了更全面的基准，揭示了当前模型的局限性，推动了更强大的工具使用代理的发展。

Abstract: We introduce MCP-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models
(LLMs) on realistic, multi-step tasks that demand tool use, cross-tool
coordination, precise parameter control, and planning/reasoning for solving
tasks. Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), MCP-Bench connects LLMs to 28
representative live MCP servers spanning 250 tools across domains such as
finance, traveling, scientific computing, and academic search. Unlike prior
API-based benchmarks, each MCP server provides a set of complementary tools
designed to work together, enabling the construction of authentic, multi-step
tasks with rich input-output coupling. Tasks in MCP-Bench test agents' ability
to retrieve relevant tools from fuzzy instructions without explicit tool names,
plan multi-hop execution trajectories for complex objectives, ground responses
in intermediate tool outputs, and orchestrate cross-domain workflows -
capabilities not adequately evaluated by existing benchmarks that rely on
explicit tool specifications, shallow few-step workflows, and isolated domain
operations. We propose a multi-faceted evaluation framework covering tool-level
schema understanding and usage, trajectory-level planning, and task completion.
Experiments on 20 advanced LLMs reveal persistent challenges in MCP-Bench. Code

*Yucheng Ruan,Xiang Lan,Daniel J. Tan,Hairil Rizal Abdullah,Mengling Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习和自然语言处理的多模态电子健康记录分析框架，用于预测ICU患者的死亡率和资源利用情况，在三个临床任务上均优于现有方法，并展现出对结构化数据损坏的强鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注结构化电子健康记录，忽略了自由文本笔记中的宝贵临床见解，且未充分利用结构化数据中的文本信息潜力。需要开发能够整合多模态EHR数据的预测模型来优化ICU患者预后和成本管理。

Method: 使用两个真实世界EHR数据集，开发了基于自然语言处理技术的深度学习框架，包含医疗提示、自由文本和预训练句子编码器三个关键组件，并在三个临床任务上与现有领先方法进行比较评估。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上的三个临床任务中，模型性能显著提升：死亡率预测BACC/AUROC提高1.6%/0.8%，住院时间预测RMSE/MAE改善0.5%/2.2%，手术时长估计RMSE/MAE提升10.9%/11.0%，在不同损坏率下均表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架是预测重症监护死亡率和资源利用的有效准确方法，成功展示了使用提示学习和Transformer编码器分析多模态EHR的潜力，对结构化数据损坏具有强韧性，特别是在高损坏水平下。

Abstract: Background Predicting mortality and resource utilization from electronic
health records (EHRs) is challenging yet crucial for optimizing patient
outcomes and managing costs in intensive care unit (ICU). Existing approaches
predominantly focus on structured EHRs, often ignoring the valuable clinical
insights in free-text notes. Additionally, the potential of textual information
within structured data is not fully leveraged. This study aimed to introduce
and assess a deep learning framework using natural language processing
techniques that integrates multimodal EHRs to predict mortality and resource
utilization in critical care settings. Methods Utilizing two real-world EHR
datasets, we developed and evaluated our model on three clinical tasks with
leading existing methods. We also performed an ablation study on three key
components in our framework: medical prompts, free-texts, and pre-trained
sentence encoder. Furthermore, we assessed the model's robustness against the
corruption in structured EHRs. Results Our experiments on two real-world
datasets across three clinical tasks showed that our proposed model improved
performance metrics by 1.6\%/0.8\% on BACC/AUROC for mortality prediction,
0.5%/2.2% on RMSE/MAE for LOS prediction, 10.9%/11.0% on RMSE/MAE for surgical
duration estimation compared to the best existing methods. It consistently
demonstrated superior performance compared to other baselines across three
tasks at different corruption rates. Conclusions The proposed framework is an
effective and accurate deep learning approach for predicting mortality and
resource utilization in critical care. The study also highlights the success of
using prompt learning with a transformer encoder in analyzing multimodal EHRs.
Importantly, the model showed strong resilience to data corruption within
structured data, especially at high corruption levels.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了ConspirED数据集，用于识别和分析阴谋论内容的认知特征，并评估大型语言模型对阴谋论输入的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阴谋论侵蚀公众对科学和机构的信任，且随着AI生成虚假信息的日益复杂化，理解阴谋论内容的修辞模式对于开发干预措施和评估AI漏洞至关重要。

Method: 创建ConspirED数据集，包含在线阴谋论文章的多句子摘录，使用CONSPIR认知框架进行标注。开发计算模型识别阴谋论特征，并评估大型语言模型对阴谋论输入的鲁棒性。

Result: 发现大型语言模型容易被阴谋论内容误导，产生的输出会反映输入内容的推理模式，即使能够成功处理类似的事实核查错误信息。

Conclusion: ConspirED数据集为识别阴谋论认知特征和评估AI模型鲁棒性提供了重要工具，揭示了当前AI系统在处理阴谋论内容时的脆弱性。

Abstract: Conspiracy theories erode public trust in science and institutions while
resisting debunking by evolving and absorbing counter-evidence. As AI-generated
misinformation becomes increasingly sophisticated, understanding rhetorical
patterns in conspiratorial content is important for developing interventions
such as targeted prebunking and assessing AI vulnerabilities. We introduce
ConspirED (CONSPIR Evaluation Dataset), which captures the cognitive traits of
conspiratorial ideation in multi-sentence excerpts (80--120 words) from online
conspiracy articles, annotated using the CONSPIR cognitive framework
(Lewandowsky and Cook, 2020). ConspirED is the first dataset of conspiratorial
content annotated for general cognitive traits. Using ConspirED, we (i) develop
computational models that identify conspiratorial traits and determine dominant
traits in text excerpts, and (ii) evaluate large language/reasoning model
(LLM/LRM) robustness to conspiratorial inputs. We find that both are misaligned
by conspiratorial content, producing output that mirrors input reasoning
patterns, even when successfully deflecting comparable fact-checked
misinformation.

TL;DR: FLORES+基准测试在200多种语言的多语言机器翻译评估中存在质量问题，包括翻译质量低于声称标准、源文本领域特定和文化偏见、命名实体复制可获高分等问题，需要更领域通用和文化中立的基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究FLORES+多语言机器翻译基准测试的实际适用性，发现其在真正多语言评估方面存在严重缺陷，需要改进基准设计以更好地反映真实世界的翻译挑战。

Method: 通过对四种语言（Asante Twi、日语、Jinghpaw和南阿塞拜疆语）的数据进行人工评估，分析翻译质量、领域相关性和文化偏见，并使用简单启发式方法测试评估协议的脆弱性。

Result: 发现许多翻译质量低于声称的90%标准，源句子过于领域特定且偏向英语世界文化，命名实体复制可获得不错的BLEU分数，高质量训练的MT模型在FLORES+上表现差但在领域相关评估集上表现好。

Conclusion: 需要开发使用领域通用、文化中立源文本且减少依赖命名实体的多语言MT基准，以更准确地评估机器翻译系统的真实能力。

Abstract: Multilingual machine translation (MT) benchmarks play a central role in
evaluating the capabilities of modern MT systems. Among them, the FLORES+
benchmark is widely used, offering English-to-many translation data for over
200 languages, curated with strict quality control protocols. However, we study
data in four languages (Asante Twi, Japanese, Jinghpaw, and South Azerbaijani)
and uncover critical shortcomings in the benchmark's suitability for truly
multilingual evaluation. Human assessments reveal that many translations fall
below the claimed 90% quality standard, and the annotators report that source
sentences are often too domain-specific and culturally biased toward the
English-speaking world. We further demonstrate that simple heuristics, such as
copying named entities, can yield non-trivial BLEU scores, suggesting
vulnerabilities in the evaluation protocol. Notably, we show that MT models
trained on high-quality, naturalistic data perform poorly on FLORES+ while
achieving significant gains on our domain-relevant evaluation set. Based on
these findings, we advocate for multilingual MT benchmarks that use
domain-general and culturally neutral source texts rely less on named entities,
in order to better reflect real-world translation challenges.

TL;DR: SciTopic是一种基于大语言模型增强的科学文献主题发现方法，通过构建文本编码器、空间优化模块和LLM指导的对比学习，显著提升了科学主题识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主题发现方法主要依赖词嵌入技术，缺乏对科学文献的全面理解，难以处理复杂的高维文本关系。大语言模型在文本理解方面的卓越能力为解决这一问题提供了新思路。

Method: 1) 构建文本编码器捕获科学文献内容(元数据、标题、摘要)；2) 构建空间优化模块，整合基于熵的采样和LLM指导的三元组任务；3) 基于LLM指导微调文本编码器，通过优化三元组对比损失使编码器更好区分不同主题的实例。

Result: 在三个真实世界科学文献数据集上的大量实验表明，SciTopic优于最先进的科学主题发现方法，使研究人员能够获得更深入、更快速的洞察。

Conclusion: SciTopic通过利用大语言模型的文本理解能力，有效解决了传统主题发现方法的局限性，为科学文献主题分析提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: Topic discovery in scientific literature provides valuable insights for
researchers to identify emerging trends and explore new avenues for
investigation, facilitating easier scientific information retrieval. Many
machine learning methods, particularly deep embedding techniques, have been
applied to discover research topics. However, most existing topic discovery
methods rely on word embedding to capture the semantics and lack a
comprehensive understanding of scientific publications, struggling with
complex, high-dimensional text relationships. Inspired by the exceptional
comprehension of textual information by large language models (LLMs), we
propose an advanced topic discovery method enhanced by LLMs to improve
scientific topic identification, namely SciTopic. Specifically, we first build
a textual encoder to capture the content from scientific publications,
including metadata, title, and abstract. Next, we construct a space
optimization module that integrates entropy-based sampling and triplet tasks
guided by LLMs, enhancing the focus on thematic relevance and contextual
intricacies between ambiguous instances. Then, we propose to fine-tune the
textual encoder based on the guidance from the LLMs by optimizing the
contrastive loss of the triplets, forcing the text encoder to better
discriminate instances of different topics. Finally, extensive experiments
conducted on three real-world datasets of scientific publications demonstrate
that SciTopic outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) scientific topic
discovery methods, enabling researchers to gain deeper and faster insights.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种适配式联邦蓄米（AdaFD）框架，以解决多域非IID数据在联邦学习中的挑战，并构建了一个统一的基准测试框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦蓄米方法主要关注标签分布的异质性，而忽视了语言域（输入）的多样性，这在NLP任务中很重要。需要一种能够处理多域非IID数据挑战的综合性方案。

Method: 提出Adaptive Federated Distillation (AdaFD)框架，设计了一个包含多样化数据的统一基准测试框架，能够在同构和异构设置下处理多域非IID问题。

Result: 实验结果显示，该模型能够抓住本地客户端的多样性，与现有方法相比获得更好的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为联邦学习提供了一个更全面的多域非IID场景测试框架，AdaFD框架能够有效应对真实环境中的语言域多样性挑战。

Abstract: The widespread success of pre-trained language models has established a new
training paradigm, where a global PLM is fine-tuned using task-specific data
from local clients. The local data are highly different from each other and can
not capture the global distribution of the whole data in real world. To address
the challenges of non-IID data in real environments, privacy-preserving
federated distillation has been proposed and highly investigated. However,
previous experimental non-IID scenarios are primarily identified with the label
(output) diversity, without considering the diversity of language domains
(input) that is crucial in natural language processing. In this paper, we
introduce a comprehensive set of multi-domain non-IID scenarios and propose a
unified benchmarking framework that includes diverse data. The benchmark can be
used to evaluate the federated learning framework in a real environment. To
this end, we propose an Adaptive Federated Distillation (AdaFD) framework
designed to address multi-domain non-IID challenges in both homogeneous and
heterogeneous settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our models
capture the diversity of local clients and achieve better performance compared
to the existing works. The code for this paper is available at:

Conclusion: 生成式模型在工业网络搜索的实时查询驱动文本摘要任务中具有显著优势，通过适当的优化技术可以实现高性能和高效率的部署。

Abstract: In the dynamic landscape of large-scale web search, Query-Driven Text
Summarization (QDTS) aims to generate concise and informative summaries from
textual documents based on a given query, which is essential for improving user
engagement and facilitating rapid decision-making. Traditional extractive
summarization models, based primarily on ranking candidate summary segments,
have been the dominant approach in industrial applications. However, these
approaches suffer from two key limitations: 1) The multi-stage pipeline often
introduces cumulative information loss and architectural bottlenecks due to its
weakest component; 2) Traditional models lack sufficient semantic understanding
of both user queries and documents, particularly when dealing with complex
search intents. In this study, we propose a novel framework to pioneer the
application of generative models to address real-time QDTS in industrial web
search. Our approach integrates large model distillation, supervised
fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and lookahead decoding to
transform a lightweight model with only 0.1B parameters into a
domain-specialized QDTS expert. Evaluated on multiple industry-relevant
metrics, our model outperforms the production baseline and achieves a new state
of the art. Furthermore, it demonstrates excellent deployment efficiency,
requiring only 334 NVIDIA L20 GPUs to handle \textasciitilde50,000 queries per
second under 55~ms average latency per query.

Conclusion: KCS框架有效提升了多跳问答的数据多样性和模型性能，通过知识组合采样解决了数据稀疏性问题

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering faces substantial challenges due to data
sparsity, which increases the likelihood of language models learning spurious
patterns. To address this issue, prior research has focused on diversifying
question generation through content planning and varied expression. However,
these approaches often emphasize generating simple questions and neglect the
integration of essential knowledge, such as relevant sentences within
documents. This paper introduces the Knowledge Composition Sampling (KCS), an
innovative framework designed to expand the diversity of generated multi-hop
questions by sampling varied knowledge compositions within a given context. KCS
models the knowledge composition selection as a sentence-level conditional
prediction task and utilizes a probabilistic contrastive loss to predict the
next most relevant piece of knowledge. During inference, we employ a stochastic
decoding strategy to effectively balance accuracy and diversity. Compared to
competitive baselines, our KCS improves the overall accuracy of knowledge
composition selection by 3.9%, and its application for data augmentation yields
improvements on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA datasets. Our code is available

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了新的CLEGR测试标准，指出当前图语言模型的评测数据集存在缺陷，无法真正评估多模态推理能力，且现有GLM模型在结构化推理上表现差强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图语言模型的评测标准主要重用节点分类数据集，这些数据集只需要单模态信息就能获得强励的性能，无法真正评估图结构与语言的多模态融合推理能力。

Method: 提出CLEGR评测标准，通过综合图生成流水线产生合成图结构和需要结构与语义联合推理的问题，对代表性GLM架构进行详细评估。

Result: 软提示LM基线模型与包含完整GNN核心的GLM表现相似，GLM在需要结构化推理的任务中性能显著下降，这对将图结构整合到LLM中的架构必要性提出了质疑。

Conclusion: 当前GLM在图结构推理能力上存在显著局限性，CLEGR标准为推进多模态推理研究提供了基础，应重新考虑如何有效融合图结构与语言的推理能力。

Abstract: Developments in Graph-Language Models (GLMs) aim to integrate the structural
reasoning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the semantic
understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, we demonstrate that
current evaluation benchmarks for GLMs, which are primarily repurposed
node-level classification datasets, are insufficient to assess multimodal
reasoning. Our analysis reveals that strong performance on these benchmarks is
achievable using unimodal information alone, suggesting that they do not
necessitate graph-language integration. To address this evaluation gap, we
introduce the CLEGR(Compositional Language-Graph Reasoning) benchmark, designed
to evaluate multimodal reasoning at various complexity levels. Our benchmark
employs a synthetic graph generation pipeline paired with questions that
require joint reasoning over structure and textual semantics. We perform a
thorough evaluation of representative GLM architectures and find that
soft-prompted LLM baselines perform on par with GLMs that incorporate a full
GNN backbone. This result calls into question the architectural necessity of
incorporating graph structure into LLMs. We further show that GLMs exhibit
significant performance degradation in tasks that require structural reasoning.
These findings highlight limitations in the graph reasoning capabilities of
current GLMs and provide a foundation for advancing the community toward
explicit multimodal reasoning involving graph structure and language.

Motivation: 现有的基于语音编辑距离的名称实体纠正模型在转写词语和真实实体形式差异较大时效果不佳，导致下游任务出现恶性错误。

Method: 利用语音声音特征检索候选实体，设计了一种生成式方法来注释ASR转写文本中的实体错误并替换为正确实体。

Result: 在开源和自建测试集上的实验结果显示，该方法能够显著提高实体识别的准确性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的新方法有效解决了当字形差异较大时现有NEC方法的限制，为领域特定名称实体识别提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition systems often fail to transcribe
domain-specific named entities, causing catastrophic failures in downstream
tasks. Numerous fast and lightweight named entity correction (NEC) models have
been proposed in recent years. These models, mainly leveraging phonetic-level
edit distance algorithms, have shown impressive performances. However, when the
forms of the wrongly-transcribed words(s) and the ground-truth entity are
significantly different, these methods often fail to locate the wrongly
transcribed words in hypothesis, thus limiting their usage. We propose a novel
NEC method that utilizes speech sound features to retrieve candidate entities.
With speech sound features and candidate entities, we inovatively design a
generative method to annotate entity errors in ASR transcripts and replace the
text with correct entities. This method is effective in scenarios of word form
difference. We test our method using open-source and self-constructed test
sets. The results demonstrate that our NEC method can bring significant
improvement to entity accuracy. We will open source our self-constructed test
set and training data.

Conclusion: 任务特定的微调在隐式篇章关系识别中优于提示方法，层次化方法有效且在DiscoGeM 1.0语料上达到了最先进的性能

Abstract: This paper introduces the first multi-lingual and multi-label classification
model for implicit discourse relation recognition (IDRR). Our model, HArch, is
evaluated on the recently released DiscoGeM 2.0 corpus and leverages
hierarchical dependencies between discourse senses to predict probability
distributions across all three sense levels in the PDTB 3.0 framework. We
compare several pre-trained encoder backbones and find that RoBERTa-HArch
achieves the best performance in English, while XLM-RoBERTa-HArch performs best
in the multi-lingual setting. In addition, we compare our fine-tuned models
against GPT-4o and Llama-4-Maverick using few-shot prompting across all
language configurations. Our results show that our fine-tuned models
consistently outperform these LLMs, highlighting the advantages of
task-specific fine-tuning over prompting in IDRR. Finally, we report SOTA
results on the DiscoGeM 1.0 corpus, further validating the effectiveness of our
hierarchical approach.

*Ruiyi Yan,Yugo Murawaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究针对文本隐写和水印中的tokenization不一致问题，提出了两种解决方案：逐步验证法用于隐写，后验回滚法用于水印，有效提升了文本质量和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型提升了文本生成能力，但也带来了隐写和水印中的tokenization不一致问题，这会破坏系统的鲁棒性。研究发现问题token具有低频性和临时性特征。

Method: 提出了两种针对性解决方案：1）针对隐写的逐步验证方法；2）针对水印的后验回滚方法，专门处理tokenization不一致问题。

Result: 实验表明：1）与传统消歧方法相比，直接处理tokenization不一致问题能提升隐写的流畅性、隐蔽性和抗隐写分析能力；2）对水印而言，处理该问题能增强可检测性和抗攻击鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过专门处理tokenization不一致问题，显著提升了文本隐写和水印系统的性能表现，为解决这一关键问题提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Large language models have significantly enhanced the capacities and
efficiency of text generation. On the one hand, they have improved the quality
of text-based steganography. On the other hand, they have also underscored the
importance of watermarking as a safeguard against malicious misuse. In this
study, we focus on tokenization inconsistency (TI) between Alice and Bob in
steganography and watermarking, where TI can undermine robustness. Our
investigation reveals that the problematic tokens responsible for TI exhibit
two key characteristics: infrequency and temporariness. Based on these
findings, we propose two tailored solutions for TI elimination: a stepwise
verification method for steganography and a post-hoc rollback method for
watermarking. Experiments show that (1) compared to traditional disambiguation
methods in steganography, directly addressing TI leads to improvements in
fluency, imperceptibility, and anti-steganalysis capacity; (2) for
watermarking, addressing TI enhances detectability and robustness against
attacks.

TL;DR: rStar2-Agent是一个14B参数的数学推理模型，通过智能体强化学习训练，在有限GPU资源下实现前沿性能，在AIME数学竞赛中超越DeepSeek-R1等大型模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的长链思维（CoT）方法在复杂问题解决中存在局限性，需要开发能够自主探索、验证和优化中间步骤的智能体模型，同时降低训练成本。

Method: 采用三阶段训练方法：非推理SFT预训练、多阶段RL训练，结合GRPO-RoC算法和重采样策略，在高效Python代码环境中进行高吞吐量执行。

Result: 仅用510个RL步骤和一周时间，在AIME24和AIME25上分别达到80.6%和69.8%的pass@1分数，超越671B参数的DeepSeek-R1模型，响应更短。

Conclusion: rStar2-Agent证明了小模型通过智能体强化学习可以实现前沿性能，不仅在数学推理，还在对齐、科学推理和工具使用任务中表现出强泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce rStar2-Agent, a 14B math reasoning model trained with agentic
reinforcement learning to achieve frontier-level performance. Beyond current
long CoT, the model demonstrates advanced cognitive behaviors, such as thinking
carefully before using Python coding tools and reflecting on code execution
feedback to autonomously explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps in
complex problem-solving. This capability is enabled through three key
innovations that makes agentic RL effective at scale: (i) an efficient RL
infrastructure with a reliable Python code environment that supports
high-throughput execution and mitigates the high rollout costs, enabling
training on limited GPU resources (64 MI300X GPUs); (ii) GRPO-RoC, an agentic
RL algorithm with a Resample-on-Correct rollout strategy that addresses the
inherent environment noises from coding tools, allowing the model to reason
more effectively in a code environment; (iii) An efficient agent training
recipe that starts with non-reasoning SFT and progresses through multi-RL
stages, yielding advanced cognitive abilities with minimal compute cost. To
this end, rStar2-Agent boosts a pre-trained 14B model to state of the art in
only 510 RL steps within one week, achieving average pass@1 scores of 80.6% on
AIME24 and 69.8% on AIME25, surpassing DeepSeek-R1 (671B) with significantly
shorter responses. Beyond mathematics, rStar2-Agent-14B also demonstrates
strong generalization to alignment, scientific reasoning, and agentic tool-use
tasks. Code and training recipes are available at

*Stephen Meisenbacher,Maulik Chevli,Florian Matthes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DP-ST方法，利用语义三元组在本地差分隐私下实现邻域感知的私有文档生成，通过分治策略和LLM后处理在较低ε值下平衡隐私与效用


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有本地差分隐私文本处理需要极高ε值才能保持合理性，隐私保护与文本效用之间存在严重冲突

Method: 基于语义三元组的邻域感知私有文档生成，采用分治策略限制隐私邻域概念，结合LLM后处理提升文本连贯性

Result: 在较低ε值下实现了连贯的文本生成，有效平衡了隐私保护与文本效用

Conclusion: 文本连贯性对于在合理ε水平下实现平衡的隐私化输出至关重要，分治策略结合LLM后处理是有效的解决方案

Abstract: Many works at the intersection of Differential Privacy (DP) in Natural
Language Processing aim to protect privacy by transforming texts under DP
guarantees. This can be performed in a variety of ways, from word perturbations
to full document rewriting, and most often under local DP. Here, an input text
must be made indistinguishable from any other potential text, within some bound
governed by the privacy parameter $\varepsilon$. Such a guarantee is quite
demanding, and recent works show that privatizing texts under local DP can only
be done reasonably under very high $\varepsilon$ values. Addressing this
challenge, we introduce DP-ST, which leverages semantic triples for
neighborhood-aware private document generation under local DP guarantees.
Through the evaluation of our method, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the
divide-and-conquer paradigm, particularly when limiting the DP notion (and
privacy guarantees) to that of a privatization neighborhood. When combined with
LLM post-processing, our method allows for coherent text generation even at
lower $\varepsilon$ values, while still balancing privacy and utility. These
findings highlight the importance of coherence in achieving balanced
privatization outputs at reasonable $\varepsilon$ levels.

TL;DR: 通过细调基于LLM的通用嵌入模型，在隐式令人恐怖语言检测中实现了独立于外部知识的独制方法，获得了显著的性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式令人恐怖语言(IHS)通过隐蕴符号、讽刺或代码术语传递偏见和恨意，因其没有显式辱辱性词汇而难以检测。传统方法需要依赖外部知识和上下文等额外信息

Method: 仅通过细调最新的通用嵌入模型（Stella、Jasper、NV-Embed、E5），这些模型基于大型语言模型(LLMs)构建，无需使用外部知识或额外信息

Result: 在多个IHS数据集上进行实验，在数据集内评估中F1-macro指标提升1.10个百分点，在跨数据集评估中提升达20.35个百分点，达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 细调基于LLM的通用嵌入模型可以有效检测隐式令人恐怖语言，无需依赖外部知识或额外信息，且在跨数据集评估中显示出更好的通用性

Abstract: Implicit hate speech (IHS) is indirect language that conveys prejudice or
hatred through subtle cues, sarcasm or coded terminology. IHS is challenging to
detect as it does not include explicit derogatory or inflammatory words. To
address this challenge, task-specific pipelines can be complemented with
external knowledge or additional information such as context, emotions and
sentiment data. In this paper, we show that, by solely fine-tuning recent
general-purpose embedding models based on large language models (LLMs), such as
Stella, Jasper, NV-Embed and E5, we achieve state-of-the-art performance.
Experiments on multiple IHS datasets show up to 1.10 percentage points
improvements for in-dataset, and up to 20.35 percentage points improvements in
cross-dataset evaluation, in terms of F1-macro score.

TL;DR: GUARD是一种自适应的解码方法，通过全局和局部不确定性信号平衡文本生成的连贯性和多样性，同时显著提升生成速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放文本生成中连贯性与多样性平衡的挑战，现有对比搜索方法存在超参数依赖和计算成本高的问题

Method: 提出"Glocal"不确定性驱动框架，结合全局熵估计和局部熵偏差，整合长短期不确定性信号，并加入基于token计数的惩罚机制

Result: 实验证明GUARD在文本多样性和连贯性之间取得良好平衡，生成速度显著提升，人工和LLM评估均验证其优异性能

Conclusion: GUARD通过创新的不确定性驱动框架有效解决了文本生成的质量-效率权衡问题，为实际应用提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Open-ended text generation faces a critical challenge: balancing coherence
with diversity in LLM outputs. While contrastive search-based decoding
strategies have emerged to address this trade-off, their practical utility is
often limited by hyperparameter dependence and high computational costs. We
introduce GUARD, a self-adaptive decoding method that effectively balances
these competing objectives through a novel "Glocal" uncertainty-driven
framework. GUARD combines global entropy estimates with local entropy
deviations to integrate both long-term and short-term uncertainty signals. We
demonstrate that our proposed global entropy formulation effectively mitigates
abrupt variations in uncertainty, such as sudden overconfidence or high entropy
spikes, and provides theoretical guarantees of unbiasedness and consistency. To
reduce computational overhead, we incorporate a simple yet effective
token-count-based penalty into GUARD. Experimental results demonstrate that
GUARD achieves a good balance between text diversity and coherence, while
exhibiting substantial improvements in generation speed. In a more nuanced
comparison study across different dimensions of text quality, both human and
LLM evaluators validated its remarkable performance. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文对比分析了真实与LLM生成的认知行为疗法对话在情感动态方面的差异，发现合成对话在情感变化、语言丰富度和反应模式上与真实会话存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型生成的合成疗法对话在心理健康NLP领域的应用日益增多，需要验证这些合成对话是否能够准确摘据真实疗法中的细微情感动态。

Method: 采用Utterance Emotion Dynamics框架分析价值(valence)、舌动(arousal)和主导(dominance)维度的情感轨迹，对比公开视频转写的真实CBT会话和CACTUS数据集中的合成对话。

Result: 合成对话虽然流畅且结构一致，但在情感变化性、情感语言丰富度和真实反应模式上显著差于真实对话，尤其是客户角色的情感轨迹相似度较低。

Conclusion: 当前LLM生成的疗法数据在情感保真度方面存在显著局限性，心理健康应用中应重视情感准确性。论文提供了RealCBT数据集支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Synthetic therapy dialogues generated by large language models (LLMs) are
increasingly used in mental health NLP to simulate counseling scenarios, train
models, and supplement limited real-world data. However, it remains unclear
whether these synthetic conversations capture the nuanced emotional dynamics of
real therapy. In this work, we conduct the first comparative analysis of
emotional arcs between real and LLM-generated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
dialogues. We adapt the Utterance Emotion Dynamics framework to analyze
fine-grained affective trajectories across valence, arousal, and dominance
dimensions. Our analysis spans both full dialogues and individual speaker roles
(counselor and client), using real sessions transcribed from public videos and
synthetic dialogues from the CACTUS dataset. We find that while synthetic
dialogues are fluent and structurally coherent, they diverge from real
conversations in key emotional properties: real sessions exhibit greater
emotional variability,more emotion-laden language, and more authentic patterns
of reactivity and regulation. Moreover, emotional arc similarity between real
and synthetic speakers is low, especially for clients. These findings
underscore the limitations of current LLM-generated therapy data and highlight
the importance of emotional fidelity in mental health applications. We
introduce RealCBT, a curated dataset of real CBT sessions, to support future
research in this space.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ROSI是一种白盒方法，通过永久性地将模型激活导向拒绝介导子空间来增强LLM的安全性对齐，无需微调，只需对残差流写入矩阵进行简单的秩一权重修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全对齐机制可以通过消除特定表示方向来绕过，需要一种能够增强而非削弱安全机制的方法。

Method: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI)，通过计算有害和无害指令对的安全方向，对所有残差流写入矩阵应用秩一权重修改。

Result: ROSI持续提高安全拒绝率（Llama Guard 3评估），同时在MMLU、HellaSwag和Arc等基准测试中保持模型效用，还能重新对齐'未审查'模型。

Conclusion: 定向、可解释的权重导向是改善LLM安全性的廉价而有效的机制，可作为资源密集型微调范式的补充。

Abstract: Safety alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) often involves mediating
internal representations to refuse harmful requests. Recent research has
demonstrated that these safety mechanisms can be bypassed by ablating or
removing specific representational directions within the model. In this paper,
we propose the opposite approach: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI), a white-box
method that amplifies a model's safety alignment by permanently steering its
activations toward the refusal-mediating subspace. ROSI operates as a simple,
fine-tuning-free rank-one weight modification applied to all residual stream
write matrices. The required safety direction can be computed from a small set
of harmful and harmless instruction pairs. We show that ROSI consistently
increases safety refusal rates - as evaluated by Llama Guard 3 - while
preserving the utility of the model on standard benchmarks such as MMLU,
HellaSwag, and Arc. Furthermore, we show that ROSI can also re-align
'uncensored' models by amplifying their own latent safety directions,
demonstrating its utility as an effective last-mile safety procedure. Our
results suggest that targeted, interpretable weight steering is a cheap and
potent mechanism to improve LLM safety, complementing more resource-intensive
fine-tuning paradigms.

Abstract: Rising mental health issues among youth have increased interest in automated
approaches for detecting early signs of psychological distress in digital text.
One key focus is the identification of cognitive distortions, irrational
thought patterns that have a role in aggravating mental distress. Early
detection of these distortions may enable timely, low-cost interventions. While
prior work has focused on English clinical data, we present the first in-depth
study of cross-lingual and cross-register generalization of cognitive
distortion detection, analyzing forum posts written by Dutch adolescents. Our
findings show that while changes in language and writing style can
significantly affect model performance, domain adaptation methods show the most
promise.

Conclusion: GDLLM框架通过有效捕捉全局特征，能够显著提升少数关系类的识别性能，并改善整体学习能力，为事件时序关系提取提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In Natural Language Processing(NLP), Event Temporal Relation Extraction
(ETRE) is to recognize the temporal relations of two events. Prior studies have
noted the importance of language models for ETRE. However, the restricted
pre-trained knowledge of Small Language Models(SLMs) limits their capability to
handle minority class relations in imbalanced classification datasets. For
Large Language Models(LLMs), researchers adopt manually designed prompts or
instructions, which may introduce extra noise, leading to interference with the
model's judgment of the long-distance dependencies between events. To address
these issues, we propose GDLLM, a Global Distance-aware modeling approach based
on LLMs. We first present a distance-aware graph structure utilizing Graph
Attention Network(GAT) to assist the LLMs in capturing long-distance dependency
features. Additionally, we design a temporal feature learning paradigm based on
soft inference to augment the identification of relations with a short-distance
proximity band, which supplements the probabilistic information generated by
LLMs into the multi-head attention mechanism. Since the global feature can be
captured effectively, our framework substantially enhances the performance of
minority relation classes and improves the overall learning ability.
Experiments on two publicly available datasets, TB-Dense and MATRES,
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个可扩展的评测框架，用于构建多源检索和综合的RAG系统评测基准，解决现有评测在多源信息整合和长文本生成方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索增强系统的评测通常假设问题答案可以从单个来源获得或者答案是短式事实性的，但实际应用需要系统能够整合分散在多个来源的信息并生成长文本回应。

Method: 设计了一个可扩展的评测框架，并构建了两个新的多源检索和综合基准(MSRS-Story和MSRS-Meet)，分别代表故事综合和摘要任务，对各种RAG流水线(包括稀疏和浓密检索器组合前沿LLM)进行了广泛实验。

Result: 实验结果显示生成质量很大程度依赖于检索效果，而检索效果因任务而异。即使在理想检索条件下，多源综合仍然具有挑战性，但理解模型在这一步骤中显著超过标准LLM。

Conclusion: 该研究为多源信息整合的RAG系统提供了一个可扩展的评测框架，并证明了检索效果对生成质量的关键影响，同时指出理解模型在多源综合任务中的优势。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented systems are typically evaluated in settings where
information required to answer the query can be found within a single source or
the answer is short-form or factoid-based. However, many real-world
applications demand the ability to integrate and summarize information
scattered across multiple sources, where no single source is sufficient to
respond to the user's question. In such settings, the retrieval component of a
RAG pipeline must recognize a variety of relevance signals, and the generation
component must connect and synthesize information across multiple sources. We
present a scalable framework for constructing evaluation benchmarks that
challenge RAG systems to integrate information across distinct sources and
generate long-form responses. Using our framework, we build two new benchmarks
on Multi-Source Retrieval and Synthesis: MSRS-Story and MSRS-Meet, representing
narrative synthesis and summarization tasks, respectively, that require
retrieval from large collections. Our extensive experiments with various RAG
pipelines -- including sparse and dense retrievers combined with frontier LLMs
-- reveal that generation quality is highly dependent on retrieval
effectiveness, which varies greatly by task. While multi-source synthesis
proves challenging even in an oracle retrieval setting, we find that reasoning
models significantly outperform standard LLMs at this distinct step.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化技术对于在资源受限硬件上部署大语言模型至关重要，但其在多语言任务上的影响仍未得到充分探索。本文通过系统性评估来填补这一研究空白。

Method: 使用5个参数量从1.7B到70B的大语言模型，在55种语言上进行机器翻译任务的后训练量化评估，比较四种量化技术（AWQ、BitsAndBytes、GGUF和AutoRound）的表现。

Result: 研究发现4位量化在高资源语言和大模型上能够保持翻译质量，但2位量化在低资源和语言类型学多样的语言上会导致显著性能下降。GGUF方法在2位精度下表现最为稳定。语言匹配的检验语料在低位量化场景中有更大好处。

Conclusion: 研究结果为在量化约束条件下部署多语言大语言模型进行机器翻译提供了可操作的见解，特别是在低资源设置中，算法选择、模型大小和检验语料的适配性都是关键因素。

Abstract: Quantization is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) on
resource-constrained hardware, but its implications for multilingual tasks
remain underexplored. We conduct the first large-scale evaluation of
post-training quantization (PTQ) on machine translation across 55 languages
using five LLMs ranging from 1.7B to 70B parameters. Our analysis reveals that
while 4-bit quantization often preserves translation quality for high-resource
languages and large models, significant degradation occurs for low-resource and
typologically diverse languages, particularly in 2-bit settings. We compare
four quantization techniques (AWQ, BitsAndBytes, GGUF, and AutoRound), showing
that algorithm choice and model size jointly determine robustness. GGUF
variants provide the most consistent performance, even at 2-bit precision.
Additionally, we quantify the interactions between quantization, decoding
hyperparameters, and calibration languages, finding that language-matched
calibration offers benefits primarily in low-bit scenarios. Our findings offer
actionable insights for deploying multilingual LLMs for machine translation
under quantization constraints, especially in low-resource settings.

Conclusion: SageLM通过联合评估语义和声学维度，结合可解释性监督和两阶段训练，显著提升了语音到语音模型的评估性能

Abstract: Speech-to-Speech (S2S) Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational to
natural human-computer interaction, enabling end-to-end spoken dialogue
systems. However, evaluating these models remains a fundamental challenge. We
propose \texttt{SageLM}, an end-to-end, multi-aspect, and explainable speech
LLM for comprehensive S2S LLMs evaluation. First, unlike cascaded approaches
that disregard acoustic features, SageLM jointly assesses both semantic and
acoustic dimensions. Second, it leverages rationale-based supervision to
enhance explainability and guide model learning, achieving superior alignment
with evaluation outcomes compared to rule-based reinforcement learning methods.
Third, we introduce \textit{SpeechFeedback}, a synthetic preference dataset,
and employ a two-stage training paradigm to mitigate the scarcity of speech
preference data. Trained on both semantic and acoustic dimensions, SageLM
achieves an 82.79\% agreement rate with human evaluators, outperforming
cascaded and SLM-based baselines by at least 7.42\% and 26.20\%, respectively.

Result: IRMA在整体通过率上显著优于ReAct、Function Calling和Self-Reflection方法，分别提升16.1%、12.7%和19.1%。

Conclusion: IRMA框架在动态环境中展现出比其他方法更优越的可靠性和一致性，为解决LLM在多轮工具调用对话中的挑战提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning and planning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) have enabled their potential as autonomous agents capable of tool
use in dynamic environments. However, in multi-turn conversational environments
like $\tau$-bench, these agents often struggle with consistent reasoning,
adherence to domain-specific policies, and extracting correct information over
a long horizon of tool-calls and conversation. To capture and mitigate these
failures, we conduct a comprehensive manual analysis of the common errors
occurring in the conversation trajectories. We then experiment with
reformulations of inputs to the tool-calling agent for improvement in agent
decision making. Finally, we propose the Input-Reformulation Multi-Agent (IRMA)
framework, which automatically reformulates user queries augmented with
relevant domain rules and tool suggestions for the tool-calling agent to focus
on. The results show that IRMA significantly outperforms ReAct, Function
Calling, and Self-Reflection by 16.1%, 12.7%, and 19.1%, respectively, in
overall pass^5 scores. These findings highlight the superior reliability and
consistency of IRMA compared to other methods in dynamic environments.

*Jiaqian Li,Qisheng Hu,Jing Li,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的两阶段示例选择策略，通过结构感知监督微调BERT检索器，并添加可插拔模块来增强句法信息，显著提升了语义解析任务中上下文学习的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ICL选择策略在结构化预测任务中往往忽视结构对齐，导致性能不佳和泛化能力差，需要一种能平衡效率、泛化性和性能的示例选择方法。

Method: 两阶段方法：1）使用结构感知监督微调BERT检索器，选择语义相关且结构对齐的示例；2）添加模型无关的可插拔模块，增强隐藏表示中的句法信息。

Result: 在四个基准测试和三个语义解析任务上的实验表明，该方法在多个最新LLM上始终优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了效率、泛化性和性能的良好平衡，可无缝集成到现有流程中，为结构化预测任务的ICL提供了有效的示例选择解决方案。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has become a powerful paradigm that enables LLMs to
perform a wide range of tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. However, the
effectiveness of ICL heavily depends on the quality of exemplar selection. In
particular, for structured prediction tasks such as semantic parsing, existing
ICL selection strategies often overlook structural alignment, leading to
suboptimal performance and poor generalization. To address this issue, we
propose a novel two-stage exemplar selection strategy that achieves a strong
balance between efficiency, generalizability, and performance. First, we
fine-tune a BERT-based retriever using structure-aware supervision, guiding it
to select exemplars that are both semantically relevant and structurally
aligned. Then, we enhance the retriever with a plug-in module, which amplifies
syntactically meaningful information in the hidden representations. This
plug-in is model-agnostic, requires minimal overhead, and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing pipelines. Experiments on four benchmarks spanning
three semantic parsing tasks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing baselines with multiple recent LLMs as inference-time
models.

TL;DR: ProactiveEval是一个统一的评估框架，用于评估大语言模型在主动对话中的能力，包括目标规划和对话引导两个核心维度，并在6个领域构建了328个评估环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注特定领域或任务导向的场景，导致评估碎片化，限制了全面探索模型的主动对话能力。

Method: 提出ProactiveEval框架，将主动对话分解为目标规划和对话引导，建立跨领域评估指标，并支持自动生成多样化评估数据。

Result: 在22种不同类型的大语言模型实验中，DeepSeek-R1在目标规划任务上表现优异，Claude-3.7-Sonnet在对话引导任务上表现最佳。

Conclusion: 研究了推理能力对主动行为的影响，并讨论了其对未来模型发展的启示。

Abstract: Proactive dialogue has emerged as a critical and challenging research problem
in advancing large language models (LLMs). Existing works predominantly focus
on domain-specific or task-oriented scenarios, which leads to fragmented
evaluations and limits the comprehensive exploration of models' proactive
conversation abilities. In this work, we propose ProactiveEval, a unified
framework designed for evaluating proactive dialogue capabilities of LLMs. This
framework decomposes proactive dialogue into target planning and dialogue
guidance, establishing evaluation metrics across various domains. Moreover, it
also enables the automatic generation of diverse and challenging evaluation
data. Based on the proposed framework, we develop 328 evaluation environments
spanning 6 distinct domains. Through experiments with 22 different types of
LLMs, we show that DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-3.7-Sonnet exhibit exceptional
performance on target planning and dialogue guidance tasks, respectively.
Finally, we investigate how reasoning capabilities influence proactive
behaviors and discuss their implications for future model development.

TL;DR: LETHE是一种通过知识稀释消除LLM后门行为的新方法，结合内部模型合并和外部提示增强，在保持模型效用的同时将后门攻击成功率降低高达98%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门防御方法存在局限性，无法应对模型编辑、多触发器和无触发器等高级攻击场景，需要更全面的防御方案

Method: 内部使用轻量级数据集训练干净模型并与后门模型合并以稀释恶意行为；外部在提示中添加良性相关证据来分散LLM对后门特征的注意力

Result: 在5个主流LLM的分类和生成任务上优于8个SOTA防御基线，对抗8种后门攻击，攻击成功率降低高达98%，保持模型效用，成本效益高且对自适应攻击鲁棒

Conclusion: LETHE提供了一种有效且全面的后门防御解决方案，通过内外结合的知识稀释机制成功消除了LLM的后门行为

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen significant advancements, achieving
superior performance in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.
However, they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where models behave
normally for standard queries but generate harmful responses or unintended
output when specific triggers are activated. Existing backdoor defenses either
lack comprehensiveness, focusing on narrow trigger settings, detection-only
mechanisms, and limited domains, or fail to withstand advanced scenarios like
model-editing-based, multi-trigger, and triggerless attacks. In this paper, we
present LETHE, a novel method to eliminate backdoor behaviors from LLMs through
knowledge dilution using both internal and external mechanisms. Internally,
LETHE leverages a lightweight dataset to train a clean model, which is then
merged with the backdoored model to neutralize malicious behaviors by diluting
the backdoor impact within the model's parametric memory. Externally, LETHE
incorporates benign and semantically relevant evidence into the prompt to
distract LLM's attention from backdoor features. Experimental results on
classification and generation domains across 5 widely used LLMs demonstrate
that LETHE outperforms 8 state-of-the-art defense baselines against 8 backdoor
attacks. LETHE reduces the attack success rate of advanced backdoor attacks by
up to 98% while maintaining model utility. Furthermore, LETHE has proven to be
cost-efficient and robust against adaptive backdoor attacks.

Motivation: 解决中小企业在部署RAG系统时面临的资源有限和缺乏NLP专业知识的挑战，使RAG技术能够更好地在工业环境中应用。

Method: 基于方法工程原理设计的EASI-RAG方法，包含明确的角色、活动和技术，通过真实案例在环境测试实验室中验证，使用操作程序数据构建问答系统。

Conclusion: EASI-RAG证明了在工业中小企业中快速部署RAG系统的可行性，未来需要扩展到更多用例并与微调模型进一步集成。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful solution to
mitigate the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
hallucinations and outdated knowledge. However, deploying RAG-based tools in
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) remains a challenge due to their limited
resources and lack of expertise in natural language processing (NLP). This
paper introduces EASI-RAG, Enterprise Application Support for Industrial RAG, a
structured, agile method designed to facilitate the deployment of RAG systems
in industrial SME contexts. EASI-RAG is based on method engineering principles
and comprises well-defined roles, activities, and techniques. The method was
validated through a real-world case study in an environmental testing
laboratory, where a RAG tool was implemented to answer operators queries using
data extracted from operational procedures. The system was deployed in under a
month by a team with no prior RAG experience and was later iteratively improved
based on user feedback. Results demonstrate that EASI-RAG supports fast
implementation, high user adoption, delivers accurate answers, and enhances the
reliability of underlying data. This work highlights the potential of RAG
deployment in industrial SMEs. Future works include the need for generalization
across diverse use cases and further integration with fine-tuned models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出使用胶囊网络中的动态路由进行句子关系抽取，在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，但发现在大型数据集Wikidata上性能不佳，主要原因是标签噪声和重表示能力不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 句子关系抽取是NLP中的重要任务，现有方法在处理大型远程监督数据集时面临性能下降的问题，需要探索更有效的表示学习方法。

Method: 采用胶囊网络的动态路由机制进行句子关系抽取，通过胶囊间的动态信息传递来学习更好的关系表示。

Result: 在Tacred、Tacredrev、Retacred和Conll04数据集上超越了现有最佳方法，但在Wikidata数据集上性能较差，发现标签噪声是主要原因。

Conclusion: 除了标签噪声问题外，重表示能力是句子关系抽取的一个重要挑战，提出的胶囊网络方法在重表示方面表现优于传统模型。

Abstract: Sentential relation extraction (RE) is an important task in natural language
processing (NLP). In this paper we propose to do sentential RE with dynamic
routing in capsules. We first show that the proposed approach outperform state
of the art on common sentential relation extraction datasets Tacred, Tacredrev,
Retacred, and Conll04. We then investigate potential reasons for its good
performance on the mentioned datasets, and yet low performance on another
similar, yet larger sentential RE dataset, Wikidata. As such, we identify noise
in Wikidata labels as one of the reasons that can hinder performance.
Additionally, we show associativity of better performance with better
re-representation, a term from neuroscience referred to change of
representation in human brain to improve the match at comparison time. As
example, in the given analogous terms King:Queen::Man:Woman, at comparison
time, and as a result of re-representation, the similarity between related head
terms (King,Man), and tail terms (Queen,Woman) increases. As such, our
observation show that our proposed model can do re-representation better than
the vanilla model compared with. To that end, beside noise in the labels of the
distantly supervised RE datasets, we propose re-representation as a challenge
in sentential RE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 税务申报需要复杂的规则推理和数值计算，传统方法容易出错且成本高昂，而纯大语言模型缺乏所需的准确性和可审计性。

Method: 将大语言模型与符号求解器集成，将文本规则预先转换为形式逻辑程序，并结合智能检索的形式案例表示范例。

Result: 该方法在SARA数据集上表现优异，能够将成本降低到远低于现实世界平均水平，证明了神经符号架构的经济可行性。

Conclusion: 神经符号架构有望为可靠税务援助提供公平访问途径，在保持高准确性的同时显著降低成本。

Abstract: According to the United States Internal Revenue Service, ''the average
American spends $\$270$ and 13 hours filing their taxes''. Even beyond the
U.S., tax filing requires complex reasoning, combining application of
overlapping rules with numerical calculations. Because errors can incur costly
penalties, any automated system must deliver high accuracy and auditability,
making modern large language models (LLMs) poorly suited for this task. We
propose an approach that integrates LLMs with a symbolic solver to calculate
tax obligations. We evaluate variants of this system on the challenging
StAtutory Reasoning Assessment (SARA) dataset, and include a novel method for
estimating the cost of deploying such a system based on real-world penalties
for tax errors. We further show how combining up-front translation of
plain-text rules into formal logic programs, combined with intelligently
retrieved exemplars for formal case representations, can dramatically improve
performance on this task and reduce costs to well below real-world averages.
Our results demonstrate the promise and economic feasibility of neuro-symbolic
architectures for increasing equitable access to reliable tax assistance.

TL;DR: CHAIR-DPO方法通过CHAIR指标构建偏好数据，使用DPO直接优化MLLMs以减少幻觉问题，在多个基准测试中有效降低幻觉回答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)存在严重的幻觉问题，即生成的答案与视觉输入不符。现有方法需要复杂流程构建合成偏好数据，且依赖专有模型。

Method: 利用CHAIR指标（原本用于图像描述幻觉评估）区分幻觉和非幻觉样本对，通过直接偏好优化(DPO)对现成MLLMs进行微调。

Result: CHAIR-DPO方法在多个幻觉基准测试中显著减少了幻觉答案的数量，证明了基于CHAIR奖励微调的有效性。

Conclusion: 将幻觉问题视为对齐问题，通过简单有效的CHAIR-DPO方法可以显著改善MLLMs的幻觉问题，无需复杂流程或专有模型。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) emerge as a unified interface to
address a multitude of tasks, ranging from NLP to computer vision. Despite
showcasing state-of-the-art results in many benchmarks, a long-standing issue
is the tendency of MLLMs to hallucinate, that is to generate answers to the
user's query that are not reflected in the visual input. In this paper, we
address the problem of hallucinations as an alignment problem, seeking to steer
the MLLM so that it prefers generating content without hallucinations. In
contrast to recent approaches that require complicated pipelines to build
synthetic preference data for alignment training, often relying on proprietary
models, we capitalize on the well-known CHAIR metric, originally proposed to
gauge the degree of hallucinations in image captioning. Given a pair of
generated answers, we leverage CHAIR to distinguish winner and loser options
(i.e., non-hallucinated and hallucinated samples) and fine-tune off-the-shelf
MLLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The resulting method, which we
refer to as CHAIR-DPO, effectively diminishes the amount of hallucinated
answers on several hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
fine-tuning the MLLM with a CHAIR-based reward. Source code and trained models
are publicly available at https://github.com/aimagelab/CHAIR-DPO.

TL;DR: 基于Stable Diffusion 3的多模态框架，通过将伪造残差作为显式模态融入潜空间，实现了更高效准确的图像伪造定位方法，在多个数据集上较现有方法提升12%性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像伪造定位方法依赖人工标注数据，成本高且难以跟上多模态大模型引发的图像编辑技术发展，需要更高效准确的解决方案

Method: 利用SD3多模态框架，将图像伪造残差（高频信号）作为显式模态融入潜空间进行训练，保留SD3提取的潜层特征和输入图像的丰富语义信息

Result: 在广泛使用的标准数据集上较现有最佳方法提升了12%性能，对训练未见的真实文档伪造图像和自然场景伪造图像也表现出强劲的防伪性能

Conclusion: 证明了Stable Diffusion多模态架构可以有效地整合到图像防伪框架中，通过残差信息来来完善伪造定位性能，为应对新兴图像编辑技术的防伪挑战提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Driven by the new generation of multi-modal large models, such as Stable
Diffusion (SD), image manipulation technologies have advanced rapidly, posing
significant challenges to image forensics. However, existing image forgery
localization methods, which heavily rely on labor-intensive and costly
annotated data, are struggling to keep pace with these emerging image
manipulation technologies. To address these challenges, we are the first to
integrate both image generation and powerful perceptual capabilities of SD into
an image forensic framework, enabling more efficient and accurate forgery
localization. First, we theoretically show that the multi-modal architecture of
SD can be conditioned on forgery-related information, enabling the model to
inherently output forgery localization results. Then, building on this
foundation, we specifically leverage the multimodal framework of Stable
DiffusionV3 (SD3) to enhance forgery localization performance.We leverage the
multi-modal processing capabilities of SD3 in the latent space by treating
image forgery residuals -- high-frequency signals extracted using specific
highpass filters -- as an explicit modality. This modality is fused into the
latent space during training to enhance forgery localization performance.
Notably, our method fully preserves the latent features extracted by SD3,
thereby retaining the rich semantic information of the input image.
Experimental results show that our framework achieves up to 12% improvements in
performance on widely used benchmarking datasets compared to current
state-of-the-art image forgery localization models. Encouragingly, the model
demonstrates strong performance on forensic tasks involving real-world document
forgery images and natural scene forging images, even when such data were
entirely unseen during training.

Motivation: 虽然AI模型在皮肤疾病诊断方面表现出色，但模型预测的可解释性仍需大幅提升才能在实际临床中使用。多模态大语言模型提供了通过自然语言推理增加可解释性的潜力，而定量属性（如病变面积）已被证明能高精度预测恶性病变。

Method: 通过微调多模态大语言模型，使其能够从图像预测与病变外观相关的定量属性值，并在SLICE-3D数据集上进行基于属性的图像检索案例研究来评估嵌入空间的属性基础。

Result: 研究证明多模态大语言模型的嵌入空间可以通过微调来基于定量属性进行基础化，使模型预测能够以可解释的概念函数形式呈现。

Conclusion: 结合多模态大语言模型和定量属性的方法为提高AI皮肤疾病诊断模型的可解释性提供了有前景的途径，为临床实践应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence models have demonstrated significant success in
diagnosing skin diseases, including cancer, showing the potential to assist
clinicians in their analysis. However, the interpretability of model
predictions must be significantly improved before they can be used in practice.
To this end, we explore the combination of two promising approaches: Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) and quantitative attribute usage. MLLMs offer a
potential avenue for increased interpretability, providing reasoning for
diagnosis in natural language through an interactive format. Separately, a
number of quantitative attributes that are related to lesion appearance (e.g.,
lesion area) have recently been found predictive of malignancy with high
accuracy. Predictions grounded as a function of such concepts have the
potential for improved interpretability. We provide evidence that MLLM
embedding spaces can be grounded in such attributes, through fine-tuning to
predict their values from images. Concretely, we evaluate this grounding in the
embedding space through an attribute-specific content-based image retrieval
case study using the SLICE-3D dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动调制识别方法依赖大量标注数据或多阶段训练流程，限制了实际应用中的可扩展性和泛化能力

Method: 使用ViT编码器、轻量卷积解码器和线性分类器的统一框架，通过重建分支将增强信号映射回原始信号，在预训练中学习鲁棒特征，在微调中使用部分标签监督

Result: 在RML2018.01A数据集上，低标签条件下优于监督CNN和ViT基线，仅用15-20%标注数据即可达到ResNet水平精度，在不同SNR级别下保持强劲性能

Conclusion: 该框架为自动调制识别提供了简单、可泛化且标签高效的解决方案

Abstract: Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is critical for cognitive radio,
spectrum monitoring, and secure wireless communication. However, existing
solutions often rely on large labeled datasets or multi-stage training
pipelines, which limit scalability and generalization in practice. We propose a
unified Vision Transformer (ViT) framework that integrates supervised,
self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives. The model combines a ViT
encoder, a lightweight convolutional decoder, and a linear classifier; the
reconstruction branch maps augmented signals back to their originals, anchoring
the encoder to fine-grained I/Q structure. This strategy promotes robust,
discriminative feature learning during pretraining, while partial label
supervision in fine-tuning enables effective classification with limited
labels. On the RML2018.01A dataset, our approach outperforms supervised CNN and
ViT baselines in low-label regimes, approaches ResNet-level accuracy with only
15-20% labeled data, and maintains strong performance across varying SNR
levels. Overall, the framework provides a simple, generalizable, and
label-efficient solution for AMR.

Motivation: 音频驱动的人体动画在现有方法中存在身份漂移、颜色偏移、场景不稳定以及手部运动建模不佳的问题，需要一种能够生成高分辨率、长时长视频且保持外观一致性和自然手部动作的解决方案。

Method: 提出coarse-to-fine框架：首先生成音频同步表示，然后使用姿态引导的细化器逐步细化为高分辨率长视频；利用解耦的姿态序列和初始帧作为视觉锚点减少漂移；引入基于高质量手部运动数据训练的手部特定奖励机制。

Conclusion: InfinityHuman通过姿态引导的细化策略和手部奖励机制，成功解决了音频驱动人体动画中的关键挑战，能够生成高质量、长时长且保持视觉一致性的视频，代码将公开。

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation has attracted wide attention thanks to its
practical applications. However, critical challenges remain in generating
high-resolution, long-duration videos with consistent appearance and natural
hand motions. Existing methods extend videos using overlapping motion frames
but suffer from error accumulation, leading to identity drift, color shifts,
and scene instability. Additionally, hand movements are poorly modeled,
resulting in noticeable distortions and misalignment with the audio. In this
work, we propose InfinityHuman, a coarse-to-fine framework that first generates
audio-synchronized representations, then progressively refines them into
high-resolution, long-duration videos using a pose-guided refiner. Since pose
sequences are decoupled from appearance and resist temporal degradation, our
pose-guided refiner employs stable poses and the initial frame as a visual
anchor to reduce drift and improve lip synchronization. Moreover, to enhance
semantic accuracy and gesture realism, we introduce a hand-specific reward
mechanism trained with high-quality hand motion data. Experiments on the EMTD
and HDTF datasets show that InfinityHuman achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video quality, identity preservation, hand accuracy, and lip-sync. Ablation
studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module. Code will be made
public.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏全面的360度视听显著性预测数据集，且现有方法未能充分考虑球形失真和空间音频对视觉注意力的影响。

Method: 提出了基于视觉Transformer的SalViT360框架，配备球形几何感知的时空注意力层；SalViT360-AV进一步整合了基于音频输入的Transformer适配器。

Result: 在多个基准数据集（包括新创建的YT360-EyeTracking）上，两个模型在预测360度场景中观众注意力方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 在模型架构中整合空间音频线索对于准确预测全景视频的视觉显著性至关重要。

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos (ODVs) are redefining viewer experiences in virtual
reality (VR) by offering an unprecedented full field-of-view (FOV). This study
extends the domain of saliency prediction to 360-degree environments,
addressing the complexities of spherical distortion and the integration of
spatial audio. Contextually, ODVs have transformed user experience by adding a
spatial audio dimension that aligns sound direction with the viewer's
perspective in spherical scenes. Motivated by the lack of comprehensive
datasets for 360-degree audio-visual saliency prediction, our study curates
YT360-EyeTracking, a new dataset of 81 ODVs, each observed under varying
audio-visual conditions. Our goal is to explore how to utilize audio-visual
cues to effectively predict visual saliency in 360-degree videos. Towards this
aim, we propose two novel saliency prediction models: SalViT360, a
vision-transformer-based framework for ODVs equipped with spherical
geometry-aware spatio-temporal attention layers, and SalViT360-AV, which
further incorporates transformer adapters conditioned on audio input. Our
results on a number of benchmark datasets, including our YT360-EyeTracking,
demonstrate that SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV significantly outperform existing
methods in predicting viewer attention in 360-degree scenes. Interpreting these
results, we suggest that integrating spatial audio cues in the model
architecture is crucial for accurate saliency prediction in omnidirectional
videos. Code and dataset will be available at

Motivation: 当前视觉模型开发主要关注性能指标（如准确率、IoU、mAP），而忽视了可解释性。现有xAI方法多为样本级别解释，缺乏能够解释模型在大规模数据集上一般行为的方法。理解视觉模型的一般行为对防止偏异判断和识别模型趋势至关重要。

Conclusion: 通过VLM技术，本文成功开发了一种能够在多级别上解释视觉模型行为的方法，填补了现有xAI方法在数据集层面解释的空白。该方法为提升视觉模型的可解释性和可信赖性提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The development of many vision models mainly focuses on improving their
performance using metrics such as accuracy, IoU, and mAP, with less attention
to explainability due to the complexity of applying xAI methods to provide a
meaningful explanation of trained models. Although many existing xAI methods
aim to explain vision models sample-by-sample, methods explaining the general
behavior of vision models, which can only be captured after running on a large
dataset, are still underexplored. Furthermore, understanding the behavior of
vision models on general images can be very important to prevent biased
judgments and help identify the model's trends and patterns. With the
application of Vision-Language Models, this paper proposes a pipeline to
explain vision models at both the sample and dataset levels. The proposed
pipeline can be used to discover failure cases and gain insights into vision
models with minimal effort, thereby integrating vision model development with
xAI analysis to advance image analysis.

Conclusion: ATMS-KD框架能够高效地实现知识迁移，在保持高精度的同时降低计算开销，适用于资源受限的农业计算视觉应用。

Abstract: This study proposes ATMS-KD (Adaptive Temperature and Mixed-Sample Knowledge
Distillation), a novel framework for developing lightweight CNN models suitable
for resource-constrained agricultural environments. The framework combines
adaptive temperature scheduling with mixed-sample augmentation to transfer
knowledge from a MobileNetV3 Large teacher model (5.7\,M parameters) to
lightweight residual CNN students. Three student configurations were evaluated:
Compact (1.3\,M parameters), Standard (2.4\,M parameters), and Enhanced (3.8\,M
parameters). The dataset used in this study consists of images of \textit{Rosa
damascena} (Damask rose) collected from agricultural fields in the Dades Oasis,
southeastern Morocco, providing a realistic benchmark for agricultural computer
vision applications under diverse environmental conditions. Experimental
evaluation on the Damascena rose maturity classification dataset demonstrated
significant improvements over direct training methods. All student models
achieved validation accuracies exceeding 96.7\% with ATMS-KD compared to
95--96\% with direct training. The framework outperformed eleven established
knowledge distillation methods, achieving 97.11\% accuracy with the compact
model -- a 1.60 percentage point improvement over the second-best approach
while maintaining the lowest inference latency of 72.19\,ms. Knowledge
retention rates exceeded 99\% for all configurations, demonstrating effective
knowledge transfer regardless of student model capacity.

<details>

Motivation: 解决工业制造中先进材料快速可靠质量评估的瓶颈问题，特别是针对非传统增材制造工艺生产的异质结构

Method: 集成深度语义分割与预训练多模态模型(CLIP和FLAVA)，开发定制化相似性表示方法，结合专家标注的正负参考样本，采用Z-score归一化和净相似性评分进行零样本分类

Result: 在增材制造金属基复合材料数据集上验证了框架区分合格与缺陷样本的能力，FLAVA模型具有更高的视觉敏感性，CLIP模型与文本标准更一致

Conclusion: 该方法通过促进原始数据与专家知识之间的语义互操作性，为工程信息学中的可扩展和领域适应性质量评估策略做出贡献，支持人机协同决策而无需任务特定模型重新训练

Abstract: Rapid and reliable qualification of advanced materials remains a bottleneck
in industrial manufacturing, particularly for heterogeneous structures produced
via non-conventional additive manufacturing processes. This study introduces a
novel framework that links microstructure informatics with a range of expert
characterization knowledge using customized and hybrid vision-language
representations (VLRs). By integrating deep semantic segmentation with
pre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA), we encode both visual
microstructural data and textual expert assessments into shared
representations. To overcome limitations in general-purpose embeddings, we
develop a customized similarity-based representation that incorporates both
positive and negative references from expert-annotated images and their
associated textual descriptions. This allows zero-shot classification of
previously unseen microstructures through a net similarity scoring approach.
Validation on an additively manufactured metal matrix composite dataset
demonstrates the framework's ability to distinguish between acceptable and
defective samples across a range of characterization criteria. Comparative
analysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the
CLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria. Z-score
normalization adjusts raw unimodal and cross-modal similarity scores based on
their local dataset-driven distributions, enabling more effective alignment and
classification in the hybrid vision-language framework. The proposed method
enhances traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines by
enabling human-in-the-loop decision-making without task-specific model
retraining. By advancing semantic interoperability between raw data and expert
knowledge, this work contributes toward scalable and domain-adaptable
qualification strategies in engineering informatics.

TL;DR: 使用MedNeXt-L-k5模型进行自动化软脚末空间分割，在T2加权MRI数据上达到领先性能，但在T1加权数据和多中心数据上性能下降，未超过nnU-Net。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动分割软脚末空间耗时且可靠性中等，现有自动化深度学习模型性能中等且端到端过渡性差，需要更好的解决方案。

Method: 适配Transformer受启发的3D编码器-解码器卷积网络MedNeXt-L-k5，在同质性T2加权数据和异质性T1加权数据上训练模型，使用5折交叉验证和留一个地点交叉验证评估性能。

Result: 在T2加权数据上达到胶上指数0.88±0.06（白质），相当于人工分割可靠性；在T1加权数据上仅有0.58±0.09；多中心验证下性能进一步下降，未超过nnU-Net。

Conclusion: MedNeXt-L-k5提供了一种高效的软脚末空间自动分割方案，但Transformer模型的全局上下文注意机制并非PVS分割的必需特征。

Abstract: Enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS) are increasingly recognized as biomarkers
of cerebral small vessel disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and
aging-related neurodegeneration. However, manual segmentation of PVS is
time-consuming and subject to moderate inter-rater reliability, while existing
automated deep learning models have moderate performance and typically fail to
generalize across diverse clinical and research MRI datasets. We adapted
MedNeXt-L-k5, a Transformer-inspired 3D encoder-decoder convolutional network,
for automated PVS segmentation. Two models were trained: one using a
homogeneous dataset of 200 T2-weighted (T2w) MRI scans from the Human
Connectome Project-Aging (HCP-Aging) dataset and another using 40 heterogeneous
T1-weighted (T1w) MRI volumes from seven studies across six scanners. Model
performance was evaluated using internal 5-fold cross validation (5FCV) and
leave-one-site-out cross validation (LOSOCV). MedNeXt-L-k5 models trained on
the T2w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved voxel-level Dice scores of
0.88+/-0.06 (white matter, WM), comparable to the reported inter-rater
reliability of that dataset, and the highest yet reported in the literature.
The same models trained on the T1w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved a
substantially lower Dice score of 0.58+/-0.09 (WM). Under LOSOCV, the model had
voxel-level Dice scores of 0.38+/-0.16 (WM) and 0.35+/-0.12 (BG), and
cluster-level Dice scores of 0.61+/-0.19 (WM) and 0.62+/-0.21 (BG).
MedNeXt-L-k5 provides an efficient solution for automated PVS segmentation
across diverse T1w and T2w MRI datasets. MedNeXt-L-k5 did not outperform the
nnU-Net, indicating that the attention-based mechanisms present in
transformer-inspired models to provide global context are not required for high
accuracy in PVS segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种训练免费、反馈驱动的自适应框架，通过将输出级的补丁级对应关系反馈到中间注意力层，增强CLIP在开放词汇分割中的空间一致性和语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在视觉-文本对齐方面表现强劲，但在开放词汇分割中由于定位能力差而表现不佳。先前的方法通过修改中间注意力来增强空间一致性，但由于后续操作（如投影）导致这种一致性无法持续传播到最终输出，且中间注意力缺乏与文本表示的直接交互。

Method: 设计了一个训练免费、反馈驱动的自适应性框架，包括注意力隔离、基于置信度的稀疏适应剪枝和适应集成等关键模块，将输出一致性线索反馈到中间注意力层。

Result: 该方法作为即插即用模块，无缝集成到四种最先进方法中，在八个基准测试中一致提升了性能，支持三种骨干网络（ViT-B、ViT-L、ViT-H）和多种注意力类型。

Conclusion: 通过利用模型输出作为更强的空间一致性先验，该方法有效增强了内部表示与最终预测之间的语义一致性，显著提升了开放词汇分割性能。

Abstract: CLIP exhibits strong visual-textual alignment but struggle with
open-vocabulary segmentation due to poor localization. Prior methods enhance
spatial coherence by modifying intermediate attention. But, this coherence
isn't consistently propagated to the final output due to subsequent operations
such as projections. Additionally, intermediate attention lacks direct
interaction with text representations, such semantic discrepancy limits the
full potential of CLIP.
  In this work, we propose a training-free, feedback-driven self-adaptive
framework that adapts output-based patch-level correspondences back to the
intermediate attention. The output predictions, being the culmination of the
model's processing, encapsulate the most comprehensive visual and textual
semantics about each patch. Our approach enhances semantic consistency between
internal representations and final predictions by leveraging the model's
outputs as a stronger spatial coherence prior. We design key modules, including
attention isolation, confidence-based pruning for sparse adaptation, and
adaptation ensemble, to effectively feedback the output coherence cues. Our
method functions as a plug-in module, seamlessly integrating into four
state-of-the-art approaches with three backbones (ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H). We
further validate our framework across multiple attention types (Q-K, self-self,
and Proxy augmented with MAE, SAM, and DINO). Our approach consistently
improves their performance across eight benchmarks.

*Zhuoran Yu,Yong Jae Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个探测框架来系统分析多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在不同层次处理视觉和文本输入的方式，发现了模型具有分阶段的结构特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在各种视觉语言任务中表现出色，但其内部处理机制尚未得到充分探索，需要系统分析模型如何处理多模态输入。

Method: 训练线性分类器从每个层次的token嵌入中预测细粒度视觉类别，使用标准化锚点问题，并在三种提示变体下评估：词汇变体、语义否定变体和输出格式变体。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5、LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3和Qwen2-VL模型中发现一致的分阶段结构：早期层进行视觉基础，中间层支持词汇整合和语义推理，最后层准备任务特定输出。

Conclusion: 研究提供了对MLLMs层次化组织的统一视角，并提供了一个轻量级、模型无关的方法来分析多模态表示动态，发现整体阶段结构稳定但具体层次分配随基础LLM架构变化而显著变化。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet their internal processing
dynamics remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce a probing framework
to systematically analyze how MLLMs process visual and textual inputs across
layers. We train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories
(e.g., dog breeds) from token embeddings extracted at each layer, using a
standardized anchor question. To uncover the functional roles of different
layers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt
variations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level
changes, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by
modifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that
preserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to
LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent
stage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle
layers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers
prepare task-specific outputs. We further show that while the overall
stage-wise structure remains stable across variations in visual tokenization,
instruction tuning data, and pretraining corpus, the specific layer allocation
to each stage shifts notably with changes in the base LLM architecture. Our
findings provide a unified perspective on the layer-wise organization of MLLMs
and offer a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for analyzing multimodal
representation dynamics.

TL;DR: 本文提出SLiCS方法，通过监督字典学习将视觉-语言联合嵌入空间分解为概念特定的线性子空间，实现更精确的概念过滤图像检索和条件生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言联合嵌入空间（如CLIP）包含丰富的语义信息，但缺乏对复杂场景内容的解耦能力。作者假设可以通过将嵌入分解为多个概念特定的分量向量来实现解耦。

Method: 采用监督字典学习方法，估计一个线性合成模型，通过稀疏、非负的字典向量组合来匹配多标签信息。使用交替优化算法保证收敛，并利用文本嵌入进行语义描述和零样本分类。

Result: SLiCS方法在TiTok压缩自编码器嵌入和DINOv2自监督嵌入上均表现出色，概念过滤图像检索的精确度显著提升，支持条件图像生成和更精确的图像检索。

Conclusion: 稀疏线性概念子空间（SLiCS）能够有效解耦视觉-语言嵌入空间，为下游任务提供更精确的概念级别控制，在多个嵌入模型上都取得了优异的性能。

Abstract: Vision-language co-embedding networks, such as CLIP, provide a latent
embedding space with semantic information that is useful for downstream tasks.
We hypothesize that the embedding space can be disentangled to separate the
information on the content of complex scenes by decomposing the embedding into
multiple concept-specific component vectors that lie in different subspaces. We
propose a supervised dictionary learning approach to estimate a linear
synthesis model consisting of sparse, non-negative combinations of groups of
vectors in the dictionary (atoms), whose group-wise activity matches the
multi-label information. Each concept-specific component is a non-negative
combination of atoms associated to a label. The group-structured dictionary is
optimized through a novel alternating optimization with guaranteed convergence.
Exploiting the text co-embeddings, we detail how semantically meaningful
descriptions can be found based on text embeddings of words best approximated
by a concept's group of atoms, and unsupervised dictionary learning can exploit
zero-shot classification of training set images using the text embeddings of
concept labels to provide instance-wise multi-labels. We show that the
disentangled embeddings provided by our sparse linear concept subspaces (SLiCS)
enable concept-filtered image retrieval (and conditional generation using
image-to-prompt) that is more precise. We also apply SLiCS to highly-compressed
autoencoder embeddings from TiTok and the latent embedding from self-supervised
DINOv2. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight the improved precision
of the concept-filtered image retrieval for all embeddings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗视觉语言模型在临床应用中存在严重的安全隐患，特别是受保护健康信息(PHI)泄露、数据泄漏和网络威胁风险，需要安全可靠的部署方案。

Method: 开发了MedFoundationHub图形用户界面工具包，支持医生手动选择和使用不同模型，工程师可插拔式部署医疗VLMs，通过Docker编排实现操作系统无关的隐私保护推理部署。

Result: 评估了5个最先进的VLMs模型，通过1015次临床医生-模型评分事件发现模型存在脱靶回答、模糊推理和病理学术语不一致等局限性。

Conclusion: MedFoundationHub提供了一个安全、易用的医疗VLMs部署解决方案，但当前模型仍存在显著局限性，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Recent advances in medical vision-language models (VLMs) open up remarkable
opportunities for clinical applications such as automated report generation,
copilots for physicians, and uncertainty quantification. However, despite their
promise, medical VLMs introduce serious security concerns, most notably risks
of Protected Health Information (PHI) exposure, data leakage, and vulnerability
to cyberthreats - which are especially critical in hospital environments. Even
when adopted for research or non-clinical purposes, healthcare organizations
must exercise caution and implement safeguards. To address these challenges, we
present MedFoundationHub, a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit that: (1)
enables physicians to manually select and use different models without
programming expertise, (2) supports engineers in efficiently deploying medical
VLMs in a plug-and-play fashion, with seamless integration of Hugging Face
open-source models, and (3) ensures privacy-preserving inference through
Docker-orchestrated, operating system agnostic deployment. MedFoundationHub
requires only an offline local workstation equipped with a single NVIDIA A6000
GPU, making it both secure and accessible within the typical resources of
academic research labs. To evaluate current capabilities, we engaged
board-certified pathologists to deploy and assess five state-of-the-art VLMs
(Google-MedGemma3-4B, Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, and
LLaVA-1.5-7B/13B). Expert evaluation covered colon cases and renal cases,
yielding 1015 clinician-model scoring events. These assessments revealed
recurring limitations, including off-target answers, vague reasoning, and
inconsistent pathology terminology.

Motivation: 解决多任务密集预测中充分跨任务交互与计算效率之间的权衡问题，现有方法往往需要在交互完整性和计算效率之间做出妥协。

Conclusion: BIM模型通过创新的扫描机制成功解决了多任务密集预测中的交互效率问题，在保持计算效率的同时实现了充分的跨任务信息交互。

Abstract: Sufficient cross-task interaction is crucial for success in multi-task dense
prediction. However, sufficient interaction often results in high computational
complexity, forcing existing methods to face the trade-off between interaction
completeness and computational efficiency. To address this limitation, this
work proposes a Bidirectional Interaction Mamba (BIM), which incorporates novel
scanning mechanisms to adapt the Mamba modeling approach for multi-task dense
prediction. On the one hand, we introduce a novel Bidirectional Interaction
Scan (BI-Scan) mechanism, which constructs task-specific representations as
bidirectional sequences during interaction. By integrating task-first and
position-first scanning modes within a unified linear complexity architecture,
BI-Scan efficiently preserves critical cross-task information. On the other
hand, we employ a Multi-Scale Scan~(MS-Scan) mechanism to achieve
multi-granularity scene modeling. This design not only meets the diverse
granularity requirements of various tasks but also enhances nuanced cross-task
feature interactions. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks,
\emph{i.e.}, NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context, show the superiority of our BIM vs its
state-of-the-art competitors.

Motivation: 现有的文本指导编辑方法在复杂场景中存在限制，需要额外的非文本编辑提示来描述复杂情况。现有音频指导方法通常需要特定数据集训练，限制了其泛化能力。

Method: 利用预训练多模态编码器的零样本能力，通过减少音频编码器空间与变分模型提示编码器空间的差异来集成多样化音频。提出分离噪声分支和适应性片选择来处理多模态编辑提示。

Result: 在多样化编辑任务上进行了全面实验，证明该框架能够通过融合音频的丰富信息来处理复杂编辑场景，而仅仅依靠文本的方法则无法完成。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种无需训练的音频指导视觉编辑方案，能够有效处理复杂的多模态编辑任务，充分利用音频信息来补充纯文本指导的不足。

Abstract: Visual editing with diffusion models has made significant progress but often
struggles with complex scenarios that textual guidance alone could not
adequately describe, highlighting the need for additional non-text editing
prompts. In this work, we introduce a novel audio-guided visual editing
framework that can handle complex editing tasks with multiple text and audio
prompts without requiring additional training. Existing audio-guided visual
editing methods often necessitate training on specific datasets to align audio
with text, limiting their generalization to real-world situations. We leverage
a pre-trained multi-modal encoder with strong zero-shot capabilities and
integrate diverse audio into visual editing tasks, by alleviating the
discrepancy between the audio encoder space and the diffusion model's prompt
encoder space. Additionally, we propose a novel approach to handle complex
scenarios with multiple and multi-modal editing prompts through our separate
noise branching and adaptive patch selection. Our comprehensive experiments on
diverse editing tasks demonstrate that our framework excels in handling
complicated editing scenarios by incorporating rich information from audio,
where text-only approaches fail.

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的大量实验表明，该框架显著推进了多标签分类，取得了最先进的结果

Conclusion: AEVLP框架通过GPR损失和DAMP技术有效解决了SPML中的噪声和准确性问题，为多标签学习提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Multi-label learning is a challenging computer vision task that requires
assigning multiple categories to each image. However, fully annotating
large-scale datasets is often impractical due to high costs and effort,
motivating the study of learning from partially annotated data. In the extreme
case of Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPML), each image is provided
with only one positive label, while all other labels remain unannotated.
Traditional SPML methods that treat missing labels as unknown or negative tend
to yield inaccuracies and false negatives, and integrating various
pseudo-labeling strategies can introduce additional noise. To address these
challenges, we propose the Generalized Pseudo-Label Robust Loss (GPR Loss), a
novel loss function that effectively learns from diverse pseudo-labels while
mitigating noise. Complementing this, we introduce a simple yet effective
Dynamic Augmented Multi-focus Pseudo-labeling (DAMP) technique. Together, these
contributions form the Adaptive and Efficient Vision-Language Pseudo-Labeling
(AEVLP) framework. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our framework significantly advances multi-label classification, achieving
state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: tdIF方法能够以更少的时间步长实现更精确的特征表示，在保持与传统IF神经元相当能耗的同时，实现了高性能和超低延迟的视觉检测

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the brain, are characterized by
minimal power consumption and swift inference capabilities on neuromorphic
hardware, and have been widely applied to various visual perception tasks.
Current ANN-SNN conversion methods have achieved excellent results in
classification tasks with ultra-low time-steps, but their performance in visual
detection tasks remains suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a delay-spike
approach to mitigate the issue of residual membrane potential caused by
heterogeneous spiking patterns. Furthermore, we propose a novel
temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron architecture for SNNs. This
enables Integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons to dynamically adjust their
accumulation and firing behaviors based on the temporal order of time-steps.
Our method enables spikes to exhibit distinct temporal properties, rather than
relying solely on frequency-based representations. Moreover, the tdIF neuron
maintains energy consumption on par with traditional IF neuron. We demonstrate
that our method achieves more precise feature representation with lower
time-steps, enabling high performance and ultra-low latency in visual detection
tasks. In this study, we conduct extensive evaluation of the tdIF method across
two critical vision tasks: object detection and lane line detection. The
results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses current ANN-SNN
conversion approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance with ultra-low
latency (within 5 time-steps).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有显著目标检测方法在复杂场景中容易丢失细节、模糊边缘，且单模态信息融合不足，需要提升对小结构和边缘区域的检测精度。

Method: 设计动态不确定性图卷积模块(DUGC)通过空间语义距离构建稀疏图传播不确定性；提出多模态协同融合策略(MCF)使用可学习模态门控权重融合RGB、深度和边缘特征的注意力图；采用多尺度BCE和IoU损失、跨尺度一致性约束和不确定性引导监督机制优化检测性能。

Conclusion: DUP-MCRNet通过动态不确定性传播和多模态协同融合有效提升了显著目标检测的精度和鲁棒性，尤其在处理复杂场景时表现优异。

Abstract: In view of the problems that existing salient object detection (SOD) methods
are prone to losing details, blurring edges, and insufficient fusion of
single-modal information in complex scenes, this paper proposes a dynamic
uncertainty propagation and multimodal collaborative reasoning network
(DUP-MCRNet). Firstly, a dynamic uncertainty graph convolution module (DUGC) is
designed to propagate uncertainty between layers through a sparse graph
constructed based on spatial semantic distance, and combined with channel
adaptive interaction, it effectively improves the detection accuracy of small
structures and edge regions. Secondly, a multimodal collaborative fusion
strategy (MCF) is proposed, which uses learnable modality gating weights to
weightedly fuse the attention maps of RGB, depth, and edge features. It can
dynamically adjust the importance of each modality according to different
scenes, effectively suppress redundant or interfering information, and
strengthen the semantic complementarity and consistency between
cross-modalities, thereby improving the ability to identify salient regions
under occlusion, weak texture or background interference. Finally, the
detection performance at the pixel level and region level is optimized through
multi-scale BCE and IoU loss, cross-scale consistency constraints, and
uncertainty-guided supervision mechanisms. Extensive experiments show that

TL;DR: 提出MSMVD方法，通过多尺度BEV特征提升多视角行人检测性能，特别针对尺度变化大的场景


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的端到端深度学习方法在多视角行人检测中难以有效处理视角内尺度一致偏小/偏大或视角间尺度差异巨大的行人检测问题

Method: 生成多尺度BEV特征：从各视角提取多尺度图像特征并逐尺度投影到BEV空间，然后使用特征金字塔网络处理这些多尺度BEV特征以融合不同尺度的多视角信息

Result: 在GMVD数据集上比之前最高MODA指标提升4.5个点，实验证明多尺度图像特征通过多尺度BEV特征能显著提升检测性能

Conclusion: 利用多尺度图像特征生成多尺度BEV特征的方法能有效解决多视角行人检测中的尺度变化问题，大幅提升检测精度

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Detection (MVPD) aims to detect pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view (BEV) from multi-view images. In MVPD, end-to-end
trainable deep learning methods have progressed greatly. However, they often
struggle to detect pedestrians with consistently small or large scales in views
or with vastly different scales between views. This is because they do not
exploit multi-scale image features to generate the BEV feature and detect
pedestrians. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel MVPD method, called
Multi-Scale Multi-View Detection (MSMVD). MSMVD generates multi-scale BEV
features by projecting multi-scale image features extracted from individual
views into the BEV space, scale-by-scale. Each of these BEV features inherits
the properties of its corresponding scale image features from multiple views.
Therefore, these BEV features help the precise detection of pedestrians with
consistently small or large scales in views. Then, MSMVD combines information
at different scales of multiple views by processing the multi-scale BEV
features using a feature pyramid network. This improves the detection of
pedestrians with vastly different scales between views. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that exploiting multi-scale image features via multi-scale BEV
features greatly improves the detection performance, and MSMVD outperforms the
previous highest MODA by $4.5$ points on the GMVD dataset.

TL;DR: 提出SFMFNet轻量级网络，通过空间-频率混合感知模块和跨注意力机制，实现实时深度伪造检测的高效准确平衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度伪造检测器计算成本高，难以实时部署，需要轻量级但有效的解决方案

Method: 设计空间-频率混合感知模块（门控机制结合空间纹理和频率伪影）、令牌选择性跨注意力机制、残差增强模糊池化结构

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现准确性和效率的良好平衡，具有强泛化能力和实际应用价值

Conclusion: SFMFNet为实时深度伪造检测提供了有效的轻量级解决方案，在保持高精度的同时显著降低计算成本

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of real-time deepfake generation techniques,
forged content is becoming increasingly realistic and widespread across
applications like video conferencing and social media. Although
state-of-the-art detectors achieve high accuracy on standard benchmarks, their
heavy computational cost hinders real-time deployment in practical
applications. To address this, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Aware
Multi-Scale Fusion Network (SFMFNet), a lightweight yet effective architecture
for real-time deepfake detection. We design a spatial-frequency hybrid aware
module that jointly leverages spatial textures and frequency artifacts through
a gated mechanism, enhancing sensitivity to subtle manipulations. A
token-selective cross attention mechanism enables efficient multi-level feature
interaction, while a residual-enhanced blur pooling structure helps retain key
semantic cues during downsampling. Experiments on several benchmark datasets
show that SFMFNet achieves a favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency,
with strong generalization and practical value for real-time applications.

Motivation: 解决实际医疗场景中部署大规模模型受计算资源限制的问题，需要开发既轻量又高性能的医学图像分类模型

Method: 采用双模型权重选择策略从大型预训练模型初始化两个轻量模型，然后应用自知识蒸馏技术进行知识迁移，最后针对目标任务进行微调

Result: 在胸部X光、肺部CT和脑部MRI等多个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比现有方法具有更优越的性能和鲁棒性

Conclusion: 双模型权重选择与自知识蒸馏的结合有效克服了传统方法在紧凑模型中保留关键信息的局限性，为医疗场景中的轻量级模型部署提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: We propose a novel medical image classification method that integrates
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation (SKD). In
real-world medical settings, deploying large-scale models is often limited by
computational resource constraints, which pose significant challenges for their
practical implementation. Thus, developing lightweight models that achieve
comparable performance to large-scale models while maintaining computational
efficiency is crucial. To address this, we employ a dual-model weight selection
strategy that initializes two lightweight models with weights derived from a
large pretrained model, enabling effective knowledge transfer. Next, SKD is
applied to these selected models, allowing the use of a broad range of initial
weight configurations without imposing additional excessive computational cost,
followed by fine-tuning for the target classification tasks. By combining
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation, our method
overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches, which often fail to
retain critical information in compact models. Extensive experiments on
publicly available datasets-chest X-ray images, lung computed tomography scans,
and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans-demonstrate the superior performance
and robustness of our approach compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于LiDAR点云压缩的高效预测编码框架，通过几何重稠密化和跨尺度特征传播模块实现紧凑特征表示，在KITTI数据集上达到最先进的压缩比和实时性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将无序点云转换为层次化的八叉树或体素结构进行稠密到稀疏的预测编码，但几何细节的极端稀疏性阻碍了高效的上下文建模，限制了压缩性能和速度。

Method: 框架包含两个轻量级模块：1) 几何重稠密化模块 - 对编码的稀疏几何进行重稠密化，在更稠密尺度提取特征后重新稀疏化；2) 跨尺度特征传播模块 - 利用多分辨率级别的占用线索指导层次化特征传播，实现跨尺度信息共享。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上实现了最先进的压缩比和实时性能，在12位量化下编码和解码均达到26 FPS。

Conclusion: 通过整合两个模块，该方法产生了紧凑的特征表示，提供了高效的上下文建模并加速了编码过程，解决了LiDAR点云压缩中的稀疏性挑战。

Abstract: LiDAR point clouds are fundamental to various applications, yet
high-precision scans incur substantial storage and transmission overhead.
Existing methods typically convert unordered points into hierarchical octree or
voxel structures for dense-to-sparse predictive coding. However, the extreme
sparsity of geometric details hinders efficient context modeling, thereby
limiting their compression performance and speed. To address this challenge, we
propose to generate compact features for efficient predictive coding. Our
framework comprises two lightweight modules. First, the Geometry
Re-Densification Module re-densifies encoded sparse geometry, extracts features
at denser scale, and then re-sparsifies the features for predictive coding.
This module avoids costly computation on highly sparse details while
maintaining a lightweight prediction head. Second, the Cross-scale Feature
Propagation Module leverages occupancy cues from multiple resolution levels to
guide hierarchical feature propagation. This design facilitates information
sharing across scales, thereby reducing redundant feature extraction and
providing enriched features for the Geometry Re-Densification Module. By
integrating these two modules, our method yields a compact feature
representation that provides efficient context modeling and accelerates the
coding process. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art
compression ratios and real-time performance, achieving 26 FPS for both
encoding and decoding at 12-bit quantization. Code is available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Droplet3D方法，利用视频数据中的常识先验来解决3D生成中的数据稀缺问题，通过构建大规模多视角视频数据集和生成模型，实现了空间一致且语义合理的3D内容生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D领域面临数据稀缺问题，相比文本和图像，互联网上的3D数据量较少。视频数据包含丰富的空间一致性和语义信息先验，可以作为替代监督信号来缓解3D生成中的泛化瓶颈。

Method: 构建了Droplet3D-4M数据集（首个大规模多视角标注视频数据集），开发了Droplet3D生成模型，支持图像和密集文本输入，利用视频中的空间一致性和语义先验进行3D生成。

Result: 实验验证了方法的有效性，能够生成空间一致且语义合理的3D内容，相比现有3D解决方案，还展现出扩展到场景级应用的潜力。

Conclusion: 视频中的常识先验显著促进了3D创作，所有资源（数据集、代码、技术框架和模型权重）均已开源。

Abstract: Scaling laws have validated the success and promise of large-data-trained
models in creative generation across text, image, and video domains. However,
this paradigm faces data scarcity in the 3D domain, as there is far less of it
available on the internet compared to the aforementioned modalities.
Fortunately, there exist adequate videos that inherently contain commonsense
priors, offering an alternative supervisory signal to mitigate the
generalization bottleneck caused by limited native 3D data. On the one hand,
videos capturing multiple views of an object or scene provide a spatial
consistency prior for 3D generation. On the other hand, the rich semantic
information contained within the videos enables the generated content to be
more faithful to the text prompts and semantically plausible. This paper
explores how to apply the video modality in 3D asset generation, spanning
datasets to models. We introduce Droplet3D-4M, the first large-scale video
dataset with multi-view level annotations, and train Droplet3D, a generative
model supporting both image and dense text input. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to
produce spatially consistent and semantically plausible content. Moreover, in
contrast to the prevailing 3D solutions, our approach exhibits the potential
for extension to scene-level applications. This indicates that the commonsense
priors from the videos significantly facilitate 3D creation. We have
open-sourced all resources including the dataset, code, technical framework,

Abstract: Corner cases are crucial for training and validating autonomous driving
systems, yet collecting them from the real world is often costly and hazardous.
Editing objects within captured sensor data offers an effective alternative for
generating diverse scenarios, commonly achieved through 3D Gaussian Splatting
or image generative models. However, these approaches often suffer from limited
visual fidelity or imprecise pose control. To address these issues, we propose
G^2Editor, a framework designed for photorealistic and precise object editing
in driving videos. Our method leverages a 3D Gaussian representation of the
edited object as a dense prior, injected into the denoising process to ensure
accurate pose control and spatial consistency. A scene-level 3D bounding box
layout is employed to reconstruct occluded areas of non-target objects.
Furthermore, to guide the appearance details of the edited object, we
incorporate hierarchical fine-grained features as additional conditions during
generation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that G^2Editor
effectively supports object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within a
unified framework, outperforming existing methods in both pose controllability
and visual quality, while also benefiting downstream data-driven tasks.

Motivation: 胎儿脑部精确分割对于生物标记物提取和神经发育评估至关重要，但胰胆体异常等稀有病变的标注数据极其稀缺，限制了深度学习模型的普遍化能力

Method: 提出病理知识基础的域随机化策略，将CCD表现的先验知识嵌入合成数据生成流程，仅从健康数据模拟多样的脑部改变

Result: 在248名健康胎儿、26名CCD患者和47名其他脑部病变的群体中验证，在CCD案例中获得显著改善，同时保持对健康和其他病变的性能。胰胆体长度估计错误从10.9mm降至0.7mm

Conclusion: 将领域特定的解剖学先验知识整合到合成数据流程中，可以有效减少数据稀缺问题，并提升对稀有但临床重要病变的分析能力

Abstract: Accurate fetal brain segmentation is crucial for extracting biomarkers and
assessing neurodevelopment, especially in conditions such as corpus callosum
dysgenesis (CCD), which can induce drastic anatomical changes. However, the
rarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of
deep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain
randomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a
synthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations
from healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without
requiring pathological annotations.
  We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with
CCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on
CCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with
other pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically
relevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show
their utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed
augmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in
healthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Beyond these
quantitative gains, our approach yields segmentations with improved topological
consistency relative to available ground truth, enabling more reliable
shape-based analyses. Overall, this work demonstrates that incorporating
domain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can effectively
mitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant
malformations.

Conclusion: 该统一框架成功整合了多种通信模态，证明了模态间协同作用的重要性，特别是唇部运动在手语理解中的关键作用，为无障碍通信提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Audio is the primary modality for human communication and has driven the
success of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies. However, such
systems remain inherently inaccessible to individuals who are deaf or hard of
hearing. Visual alternatives such as sign language and lip reading offer
effective substitutes, and recent advances in Sign Language Translation (SLT)
and Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) have improved audio-less communication.
Yet, these modalities have largely been studied in isolation, and their
integration within a unified framework remains underexplored. In this paper, we
introduce the first unified framework capable of handling diverse combinations
of sign language, lip movements, and audio for spoken-language text generation.
We focus on three main objectives: (i) designing a unified, modality-agnostic
architecture capable of effectively processing heterogeneous inputs; (ii)
exploring the underexamined synergy among modalities, particularly the role of
lip movements as non-manual cues in sign language comprehension; and (iii)
achieving performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art models
specialized for individual tasks. Building on this framework, we achieve
performance on par with or better than task-specific state-of-the-art models
across SLT, VSR, ASR, and AVSR. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that
explicitly modeling lip movements as a separate modality significantly improves
SLT performance.

Conclusion: Video-MTR通过迭代推理和双级奖励系统，有效解决了长视频理解的挑战，实现了端到端训练和优越性能。

Abstract: Long-form video understanding, characterized by long-range temporal
dependencies and multiple events, remains a challenge. Existing methods often
rely on static reasoning or external visual-language models (VLMs), which face
issues like complexity and sub-optimal performance due to the lack of
end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose Video-MTR, a reinforced
multi-turn reasoning framework designed to enable iterative key video segment
selection and question comprehension. Unlike traditional video reasoning
pipeline, which generate predictions in a single turn, Video-MTR performs
reasoning in multiple turns, selecting video segments progressively based on
the evolving understanding of previously processed segments and the current
question. This iterative process allows for a more refined and contextually
aware analysis of the video. To ensure intermediate reasoning process, we
introduce a novel gated bi-level reward system, combining trajectory-level
rewards based on answer correctness and turn-level rewards emphasizing
frame-query relevance. This system optimizes both video segment selection and
question comprehension, eliminating the need for external VLMs and allowing
end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like VideoMME, MLVU,
and EgoSchema demonstrate that Video-MTR outperforms existing methods in both
accuracy and efficiency, advancing the state-of-the-art in long video
understanding.

Motivation: 现有TTA方法未能解决M3OD中固有的双重不确定性（语义不确定性和几何不确定性），导致在真实世界域偏移下可靠性下降。

Method: 提出双重不确定性优化框架，包括：1）基于凸优化的新型无监督焦点损失实现不确定性加权；2）语义感知法向场约束保持几何一致性；3）双分支互补机制。

Result: 在多个数据集和域偏移类型上的广泛实验表明，DUO优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DUO通过联合优化双重不确定性，显著提升了单目3D目标检测在域偏移下的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) is pivotal for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, yet its reliability deteriorates
significantly under real-world domain shifts caused by environmental or sensor
variations. To address these shifts, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods have
emerged, enabling models to adapt to target distributions during inference.
While prior TTA approaches recognize the positive correlation between low
uncertainty and high generalization ability, they fail to address the dual
uncertainty inherent to M3OD: semantic uncertainty (ambiguous class
predictions) and geometric uncertainty (unstable spatial localization). To
bridge this gap, we propose Dual Uncertainty Optimization (DUO), the first TTA
framework designed to jointly minimize both uncertainties for robust M3OD.
Through a convex optimization lens, we introduce an innovative convex structure
of the focal loss and further derive a novel unsupervised version, enabling
label-agnostic uncertainty weighting and balanced learning for high-uncertainty
objects. In parallel, we design a semantic-aware normal field constraint that
preserves geometric coherence in regions with clear semantic cues, reducing
uncertainty from the unstable 3D representation. This dual-branch mechanism
forms a complementary loop: enhanced spatial perception improves semantic
classification, and robust semantic predictions further refine spatial
understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DUO over
existing methods across various datasets and domain shift types.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to more studies to enhance golfers'
shot precision. However, these existing studies have not quantitatively
established the relationship between swing posture and ball trajectory,
limiting their ability to provide golfers with the necessary insights for swing
improvement. In this paper, we propose a new dataset called CaddieSet, which
includes joint information and various ball information from a single shot.
CaddieSet extracts joint information from a single swing video by segmenting it
into eight swing phases using a computer vision-based approach. Furthermore,
based on expert golf domain knowledge, we define 15 key metrics that influence
a golf swing, enabling the interpretation of swing outcomes through
swing-related features. Through experiments, we demonstrated the feasibility of
CaddieSet for predicting ball trajectories using various benchmarks. In
particular, we focus on interpretable models among several benchmarks and
verify that swing feedback using our joint features is quantitatively
consistent with established domain knowledge. This work is expected to offer
new insight into golf swing analysis for both academia and the sports industry.

Abstract: Surface anomaly detection is pivotal for ensuring product quality in
industrial manufacturing. While 2D image-based methods have achieved remarkable
success, 3D point cloud-based detection remains underexplored despite its
richer geometric cues. We argue that the key bottleneck is the absence of
powerful pretrained foundation backbones in 3D comparable to those in 2D. To
bridge this gap, we propose Importance-Aware Ensemble Network (IAENet), an
ensemble framework that synergizes 2D pretrained expert with 3D expert models.
However, naively fusing predictions from disparate sources is non-trivial:
existing strategies can be affected by a poorly performing modality and thus
degrade overall accuracy. To address this challenge, We introduce an novel
Importance-Aware Fusion (IAF) module that dynamically assesses the contribution
of each source and reweights their anomaly scores. Furthermore, we devise
critical loss functions that explicitly guide the optimization of IAF, enabling
it to combine the collective knowledge of the source experts but also preserve
their unique strengths, thereby enhancing the overall performance of anomaly
detection. Extensive experiments on MVTec 3D-AD demonstrate that our IAENet
achieves a new state-of-the-art with a markedly lower false positive rate,
underscoring its practical value for industrial deployment.

Abstract: Despite the progress in text-to-image generation, semantic image editing
remains a challenge. Inversion-based algorithms unavoidably introduce
reconstruction errors, while instruction-based models mainly suffer from
limited dataset quality and scale. To address these problems, we propose a
descriptive-prompt-based editing framework, named DescriptiveEdit. The core
idea is to re-frame `instruction-based image editing' as `reference-image-based
text-to-image generation', which preserves the generative power of well-trained
Text-to-Image models without architectural modifications or inversion.
Specifically, taking the reference image and a prompt as input, we introduce a
Cross-Attentive UNet, which newly adds attention bridges to inject reference
image features into the prompt-to-edit-image generation process. Owing to its
text-to-image nature, DescriptiveEdit overcomes limitations in instruction
dataset quality, integrates seamlessly with ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and other
extensions, and is more scalable. Experiments on the Emu Edit benchmark show it

TL;DR: DCFS是一个新颖的持续测试时适应框架，通过双路径特征一致性和置信度感知样本学习来解决伪标签质量问题和错误累积问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无法访问源域数据的情况下，现有方法依赖模型预测生成伪标签，但伪标签质量无法保证且存在错误累积问题，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 使用双分类器将目标数据的完整特征表示解耦成语义相关特征和域相关特征，通过保持子特征与完整特征的一致性来多角度捕获数据特征，并设置自适应阈值进行置信度加权的自监督学习。

Result: 在CIFAR10-C、CIFAR100-C和ImageNet-C等多个数据集上的广泛实验验证了该方法的有效性，在持续测试时适应场景中表现出稳定的性能。

Conclusion: DCFS框架通过特征解耦和置信度感知学习，有效解决了伪标签噪声和错误累积问题，在持续测试时适应任务中取得了优异的表现。

Abstract: Continual test-time adaptation aims to continuously adapt a pre-trained model
to a stream of target domain data without accessing source data. Without access
to source domain data, the model focuses solely on the feature characteristics
of the target data. Relying exclusively on these features can lead to confusion
and introduce learning biases. Currently, many existing methods generate
pseudo-labels via model predictions. However, the quality of pseudo-labels
cannot be guaranteed and the problem of error accumulation must be solved. To
address these challenges, we propose DCFS, a novel CTTA framework that
introduces dual-path feature consistency and confidence-aware sample learning.
This framework disentangles the whole feature representation of the target data
into semantic-related feature and domain-related feature using dual classifiers
to learn distinct feature representations. By maintaining consistency between
the sub-features and the whole feature, the model can comprehensively capture
data features from multiple perspectives. Additionally, to ensure that the
whole feature information of the target domain samples is not overlooked, we
set a adaptive threshold and calculate a confidence score for each sample to
carry out loss weighted self-supervised learning, effectively reducing the
noise of pseudo-labels and alleviating the problem of error accumulation. The
efficacy of our proposed method is validated through extensive experimentation
across various datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C,
demonstrating consistent performance in continual test-time adaptation
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过3DGS模型逐步优化相机参数，通过新视角颜色损失的反向传播来完善相机标定，在标准数据集上平均提升PSNR 0.4dB。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机标定质量对新视角合成效果致命重要，1像素错误就会对重建质量产生显著影响。虽然真实场景没有真实标签，但可通过新视角合成质量来评估标定效果。

Method: 利用3DGS模型，通过新视角颜色损失对相机参数进行反向传播，实现相机标定的精细调整和优化。

Result: 在3DGS参考数据集上，新的标定方法带来平均0.4 dB PSNR的提升。

Conclusion: 调整过程可能耗时，但对于重要场景的标定（如Mip-NeRF 360），新视角质量的提升价值远超过训练时间成本。

Abstract: The quality of the camera calibration is of major importance for evaluating
progresses in novel view synthesis, as a 1-pixel error on the calibration has a
significant impact on the reconstruction quality. While there is no ground
truth for real scenes, the quality of the calibration is assessed by the
quality of the novel view synthesis. This paper proposes to use a 3DGS model to
fine tune calibration by backpropagation of novel view color loss with respect
to the cameras parameters. The new calibration alone brings an average
improvement of 0.4 dB PSNR on the dataset used as reference by 3DGS. The fine
tuning may be long and its suitability depends on the criticity of training
time, but for calibration of reference scenes, such as Mip-NeRF 360, the stake
of novel view quality is the most important.

Motivation: 医学图像标注成本高且耗时，传统主动域适应方法存在样本冗余和负迁移问题，且多模态医学数据的查询策略尚未充分探索，需要开发更有效的样本选择方法。

Method: 提出主动序列域适应框架，基于信息量和代表性设计查询策略，动态选择多模态样本进行标注和训练，优先处理最有价值的样本。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了医学图像标注成本高的问题，通过智能样本选择策略实现了高性能分割，为多模态医学图像分析提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate gross tumor volume segmentation on multi-modal medical data is
critical for radiotherapy planning in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and
glioblastoma. Recent advances in deep neural networks have brought promising
results in medical image segmentation, leading to an increasing demand for
labeled data. Since labeling medical images is time-consuming and
labor-intensive, active learning has emerged as a solution to reduce annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples to label and adapting
high-performance models with as few labeled samples as possible. Previous
active domain adaptation (ADA) methods seek to minimize sample redundancy by
selecting samples that are farthest from the source domain. However, such
one-off selection can easily cause negative transfer, and access to source
medical data is often limited. Moreover, the query strategy for multi-modal
medical data remains unexplored. In this work, we propose an active and
sequential domain adaptation framework for dynamic multi-modal sample selection
in ADA. We derive a query strategy to prioritize labeling and training on the
most valuable samples based on their informativeness and representativeness.
Empirical validation on diverse gross tumor volume segmentation tasks
demonstrates that our method achieves favorable segmentation performance,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art ADA methods. Code is available at

Motivation: 解决传统方法仅在标签级利用RGB图像和LiDAR数据，忽视了数据级的互补性，导致伪标签质量提升有限

Method: 提出数据级融合框架，利用视觉基础模型进行实例分割和深度估计，通过双向融合把2D类别标签传递给3D点云，并将2D像素投影到3D提高点密度，采用局部和全局筛选消除噪声

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上达到28.4% mAP，显著超过之前的最先进方法

Conclusion: 数据级融合策略能够更好地利用RGB和LiDAR数据的互补性，通过迭代精细伪标签显著提升了无监督3D检测的性能

Abstract: Existing LiDAR-based 3D object detectors typically rely on manually annotated
labels for training to achieve good performance. However, obtaining
high-quality 3D labels is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this
issue, recent works explore unsupervised 3D object detection by introducing RGB
images as an auxiliary modal to assist pseudo-box generation. However, these
methods simply integrate pseudo-boxes generated by LiDAR point clouds and RGB
images. Yet, such a label-level fusion strategy brings limited improvements to
the quality of pseudo-boxes, as it overlooks the complementary nature in terms
of LiDAR and RGB image data. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a
novel data-level fusion framework that integrates RGB images and LiDAR data at
an early stage. Specifically, we utilize vision foundation models for instance
segmentation and depth estimation on images and introduce a bi-directional
fusion method, where real points acquire category labels from the 2D space,
while 2D pixels are projected onto 3D to enhance real point density. To
mitigate noise from depth and segmentation estimations, we propose a local and
global filtering method, which applies local radius filtering to suppress depth
estimation errors and global statistical filtering to remove
segmentation-induced outliers. Furthermore, we propose a data-level fusion
based dynamic self-evolution strategy, which iteratively refines pseudo-boxes
under a dense representation, significantly improving localization accuracy.
Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the detector
trained by our method significantly outperforms that trained by previous
state-of-the-art methods with 28.4$\%$ mAP on the nuScenes validation
benchmark.

Abstract: Estimating Body Mass Index (BMI) from camera images with machine learning
models enables rapid weight assessment when traditional methods are unavailable
or impractical, such as in telehealth or emergency scenarios. Existing computer
vision approaches have been limited to datasets of up to 14,500 images. In this
study, we present a deep learning-based BMI estimation method trained on our
WayBED dataset, a large proprietary collection of 84,963 smartphone images from
25,353 individuals. We introduce an automatic filtering method that uses
posture clustering and person detection to curate the dataset by removing
low-quality images, such as those with atypical postures or incomplete views.
This process retained 71,322 high-quality images suitable for training. We
achieve a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 7.9% on our hold-out test
set (WayBED data) using full-body images, the lowest value in the published
literature to the best of our knowledge. Further, we achieve a MAPE of 13% on
the completely unseen~(during training) VisualBodyToBMI dataset, comparable
with state-of-the-art approaches trained on it, demonstrating robust
generalization. Lastly, we fine-tune our model on VisualBodyToBMI and achieve a
MAPE of 8.56%, the lowest reported value on this dataset so far. We deploy the
full pipeline, including image filtering and BMI estimation, on Android devices
using the CLAID framework. We release our complete code for model training,
filtering, and the CLAID package for mobile deployment as open-source

Conclusion: 研究结果深化了对域适应技术的理解，为模型在医学数据上的有效适应提供了宝贵见解，DSAN算法在医学图像分类中表现出色且具有良好解释性。

Abstract: Domain adaptation (DA) techniques have the potential in machine learning to
alleviate distribution differences between training and test sets by leveraging
information from source domains. In image classification, most advances in DA
have been made using natural images rather than medical data, which are harder
to work with. Moreover, even for natural images, the use of mainstream datasets
can lead to performance bias. {With the aim of better understanding the
benefits of DA for both natural and medical images, this study performs 557
simulation studies using seven widely-used DA techniques for image
classification in five natural and eight medical datasets that cover various
scenarios, such as out-of-distribution, dynamic data streams, and limited
training samples.} Our experiments yield detailed results and insightful
observations highlighting the performance and medical applicability of these
techniques. Notably, our results have shown the outstanding performance of the
Deep Subdomain Adaptation Network (DSAN) algorithm. This algorithm achieved
feasible classification accuracy (91.2\%) in the COVID-19 dataset using
Resnet50 and showed an important accuracy improvement in the dynamic data
stream DA scenario (+6.7\%) compared to the baseline. Our results also
demonstrate that DSAN exhibits remarkable level of explainability when
evaluated on COVID-19 and skin cancer datasets. These results contribute to the
understanding of DA techniques and offer valuable insight into the effective
adaptation of models to medical data.

Result: 在ImageNet VID数据集上，ResNet-101达到84.0% mAP，ResNeXt-101达到85.2% mAP，实现了CNN模型的最先进性能，且无需额外后处理方法

Conclusion: CLAB方法通过简单的对比学习辅助分支和动态权重策略，有效提升了视频目标检测的性能和鲁棒性，同时保持了推理效率

Abstract: Video object detection is a challenging task because videos often suffer from
image deterioration such as motion blur, occlusion, and deformable shapes,
making it significantly more difficult than detecting objects in still images.
Prior approaches have improved video object detection performance by employing
feature aggregation and complex post-processing techniques, though at the cost
of increased computational demands. To improve robustness to image degradation
without additional computational load during inference, we introduce a
straightforward yet effective Contrastive Learning through Auxiliary Branch
(CLAB) method. First, we implement a constrastive auxiliary branch using a
contrastive loss to enhance the feature representation capability of the video
object detector's backbone. Next, we propose a dynamic loss weighting strategy
that emphasizes auxiliary feature learning early in training while gradually
prioritizing the detection task as training converges. We validate our approach
through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating
consistent performance gains. Without bells and whistles, CLAB reaches a
performance of 84.0% mAP and 85.2% mAP with ResNet-101 and ResNeXt-101,
respectively, on the ImageNet VID dataset, thus achieving state-of-the-art
performance for CNN-based models without requiring additional post-processing
methods.

Motivation: 排版攻击通过向图像注入文本来操纵多模态系统，导致目标错误分类、恶意内容生成和模型越狱。需要研究CLIP模型在这种攻击下的行为并开发有效防御方法。

Method: 定位CLIP模型中负责提取和传输排版信息的专用注意力头，构建排版电路，通过选择性消融这些注意力头来防御攻击，无需微调。

Result: 在ImageNet-100的排版变体上性能提升高达19.6%，标准ImageNet-100准确率下降不到1%。无需训练的方法与依赖微调的最先进防御方法竞争力相当。

Conclusion: 发布了一系列抗排版攻击的dyslexic CLIP模型，可作为安全关键应用的即插即用替代方案，在文本识别效用与文本操纵风险之间提供更好的平衡。

Abstract: Typographic attacks exploit multi-modal systems by injecting text into
images, leading to targeted misclassifications, malicious content generation
and even Vision-Language Model jailbreaks. In this work, we analyze how CLIP
vision encoders behave under typographic attacks, locating specialized
attention heads in the latter half of the model's layers that causally extract
and transmit typographic information to the cls token. Building on these
insights, we introduce a method to defend CLIP models against typographic
attacks by selectively ablating a typographic circuit, consisting of attention
heads. Without requiring finetuning, our method improves performance by up to
19.6% on a typographic variant of ImageNet-100, while reducing standard
ImageNet-100 accuracy by less than 1%. Notably, our training-free approach
remains competitive with current state-of-the-art typographic defenses that
rely on finetuning. To this end, we release a family of dyslexic CLIP models
which are significantly more robust against typographic attacks. These models
serve as suitable drop-in replacements for a broad range of safety-critical
applications, where the risks of text-based manipulation outweigh the utility
of text recognition.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) is a crucial task in computer vision with
wide range of applications including human computer interaction, surveillance,
and assistive technologies. However, challenges such as occlusion, expression
variability, and lack of interpretability hinder the performance of traditional
FER systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful alternative by
modeling relational dependencies between facial landmarks, enabling structured
and interpretable learning. In this paper, we propose GLaRE, a novel
Graph-based Landmark Region Embedding network for emotion recognition. Facial
landmarks are extracted using 3D facial alignment, and a quotient graph is
constructed via hierarchical coarsening to preserve spatial structure while
reducing complexity. Our method achieves 64.89 percentage accuracy on AffectNet
and 94.24 percentage on FERG, outperforming several existing baselines.
Additionally, ablation studies have demonstrated that region-level embeddings
from quotient graphs have contributed to improved prediction performance.

Conclusion: FastFit通过创新的架构设计成功解决了多参考虚拟试穿的效率和功能性问题，为复杂虚拟试穿应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Despite its great potential, virtual try-on technology is hindered from
real-world application by two major challenges: the inability of current
methods to support multi-reference outfit compositions (including garments and
accessories), and their significant inefficiency caused by the redundant
re-computation of reference features in each denoising step. To address these
challenges, we propose FastFit, a high-speed multi-reference virtual try-on
framework based on a novel cacheable diffusion architecture. By employing a
Semi-Attention mechanism and substituting traditional timestep embeddings with
class embeddings for reference items, our model fully decouples reference
feature encoding from the denoising process with negligible parameter overhead.
This allows reference features to be computed only once and losslessly reused
across all steps, fundamentally breaking the efficiency bottleneck and
achieving an average 3.5x speedup over comparable methods. Furthermore, to
facilitate research on complex, multi-reference virtual try-on, we introduce
DressCode-MR, a new large-scale dataset. It comprises 28,179 sets of
high-quality, paired images covering five key categories (tops, bottoms,
dresses, shoes, and bags), constructed through a pipeline of expert models and
human feedback refinement. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD, DressCode,
and our DressCode-MR datasets show that FastFit surpasses state-of-the-art
methods on key fidelity metrics while offering its significant advantage in
inference efficiency.

Abstract: The thermal camera excels at perceiving outdoor environments under low-light
conditions, making it ideal for applications such as nighttime autonomous
driving and unmanned navigation. However, thermal cameras encounter challenges
when capturing signage from objects made of similar materials, which can pose
safety risks for accurately understanding semantics in autonomous driving
systems. In contrast, the neuromorphic vision camera, also known as an event
camera, detects changes in light intensity asynchronously and has proven
effective in high-speed, low-light traffic environments. Recognizing the
complementary characteristics of these two modalities, this paper proposes
UTA-Sign, an unsupervised thermal-event video augmentation for traffic signage
in low-illumination environments, targeting elements such as license plates and
roadblock indicators. To address the signage blind spots of thermal imaging and
the non-uniform sampling of event cameras, we developed a dual-boosting
mechanism that fuses thermal frames and event signals for consistent signage
representation over time. The proposed method utilizes thermal frames to
provide accurate motion cues as temporal references for aligning the uneven
event signals. At the same time, event signals contribute subtle signage
content to the raw thermal frames, enhancing the overall understanding of the
environment. The proposed method is validated on datasets collected from
real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior quality in traffic signage
sketching and improved detection accuracy at the perceptual level.

Abstract: Deepfake technology, driven by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), poses
significant risks to privacy and societal security. Existing detection methods
are predominantly passive, focusing on post-event analysis without preventing
attacks. To address this, we propose an active defense method based on
low-frequency perceptual perturbations to disrupt face swapping manipulation,
reducing the performance and naturalness of generated content. Unlike prior
approaches that used low-frequency perturbations to impact classification
accuracy,our method directly targets the generative process of deepfake
techniques. We combine frequency and spatial domain features to strengthen
defenses. By introducing artifacts through low-frequency perturbations while
preserving high-frequency details, we ensure the output remains visually
plausible. Additionally, we design a complete architecture featuring an
encoder, a perturbation generator, and a decoder, leveraging discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to extract low-frequency components and generate perturbations
that disrupt facial manipulation models. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW
demonstrate significant reductions in face-swapping effectiveness, improved
defense success rates, and preservation of visual quality.

Abstract: Generating 3D human motions from text is a challenging yet valuable task. The
key aspects of this task are ensuring text-motion consistency and achieving
generation diversity. Although recent advancements have enabled the generation
of precise and high-quality human motions from text, achieving diversity in the
generated motions remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we aim to
overcome the above challenge by designing a simple yet effective text-to-motion
generation method, \textit{i.e.}, Diverse-T2M. Our method introduces
uncertainty into the generation process, enabling the generation of highly
diverse motions while preserving the semantic consistency of the text.
Specifically, we propose a novel perspective that utilizes noise signals as
carriers of diversity information in transformer-based methods, facilitating a
explicit modeling of uncertainty. Moreover, we construct a latent space where
text is projected into a continuous representation, instead of a rigid
one-to-one mapping, and integrate a latent space sampler to introduce
stochastic sampling into the generation process, thereby enhancing the
diversity and uncertainty of the outputs. Our results on text-to-motion
generation benchmark datasets~(HumanML3D and KIT-ML) demonstrate that our
method significantly enhances diversity while maintaining state-of-the-art
performance in text consistency.

Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound images are inherently challenging to interpret in
liver surgery due to the limited field of view and complex anatomical
structures. Bridging the gap between preoperative and intraoperative data is
crucial for effective surgical guidance. 3D IntraVascular UltraSound (IVUS)
offers a potential solution by enabling the reconstruction of the entire organ,
which facilitates registration between preoperative computed tomography (CT)
scans and intraoperative IVUS images. In this work, we propose an
optimization-based calibration method using a 3D-printed phantom for accurate
3D Intravascular Ultrasound volume reconstruction. Our approach ensures precise
alignment of tracked IVUS data with preoperative CT images, improving
intraoperative navigation. We validated our method using in vivo swine liver
images, achieving a calibration error from 0.88 to 1.80 mm and a registration
error from 3.40 to 5.71 mm between the 3D IVUS data and the corresponding CT
scan. Our method provides a reliable and accurate means of calibration and
volume reconstruction. It can be used to register intraoperative ultrasound
images with preoperative CT images in the context of liver surgery, and enhance
intraoperative guidance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半导体制造中磁場成像(MFI)数据因专有性问题稀缺，限制了机器学习模型训练，需要生成合成数据来优化缺陷定位

Method: 基于扩散模型，集成两个物理约束，生成功率短路等常见缺陷类型的合成MFI图像

Result: 与VAE和扩散模型等SOTA生成模型相比，在定性和定量评估中显示出有希望的结果，得到领域专家认可

Conclusion: PI-GenMFI方法能有效生成高质量的合成MFI数据，为机器学习算法提供训练数据，优化半导体缺陷定位流程

Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, defect detection and localization are
critical to ensuring product quality and yield. While X-ray imaging is a
reliable non-destructive testing method, it is memory-intensive and
time-consuming for large-scale scanning, Magnetic Field Imaging (MFI) offers a
more efficient means to localize regions of interest (ROI) for targeted X-ray
scanning. However, the limited availability of MFI datasets due to proprietary
concerns presents a significant bottleneck for training machine learning (ML)
models using MFI. To address this challenge, we consider an ML-driven approach
leveraging diffusion models with two physical constraints. We propose Physics
Informed Generative Models for Magnetic Field Images (PI-GenMFI) to generate
synthetic MFI samples by integrating specific physical information. We generate
MFI images for the most common defect types: power shorts. These synthetic
images will serve as training data for ML algorithms designed to localize
defect areas efficiently. To evaluate generated MFIs, we compare our model to
SOTA generative models from both variational autoencoder (VAE) and diffusion
methods. We present a domain expert evaluation to assess the generated samples.
In addition, we present qualitative and quantitative evaluation using various
metrics used for image generation and signal processing, showing promising
results to optimize the defect localization process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数据重构攻击方法仅在浅层模型上有效，且无法充分利用语义先验知识，导致重构质量和通用性受限

Method: 使用GAN框架结合进阶性特征优化(PFO)，将生成器分解为层次块并逐步精炼中间表征，以提升图像语义保真度，同时使用L1球约束稳定优化

Result: 在高分辨率场景、分布外设置以及深层复杂DNN模型上，方法表现显著超过现有攻击方法

Conclusion: 该方法为分开推理中的隐私风险提供了更强大的评估手段，显示了中间特征所带来的严重隐私漏洞

Abstract: The growing complexity of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has led to the adoption
of Split Inference (SI), a collaborative paradigm that partitions computation
between edge devices and the cloud to reduce latency and protect user privacy.
However, recent advances in Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRAs) reveal that
intermediate features exchanged in SI can be exploited to recover sensitive
input data, posing significant privacy risks. Existing DRAs are typically
effective only on shallow models and fail to fully leverage semantic priors,
limiting their reconstruction quality and generalizability across datasets and
model architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based DRA framework
with Progressive Feature Optimization (PFO), which decomposes the generator
into hierarchical blocks and incrementally refines intermediate representations
to enhance the semantic fidelity of reconstructed images. To stabilize the
optimization and improve image realism, we introduce an L1-ball constraint
during reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
prior attacks by a large margin, especially in high-resolution scenarios,
out-of-distribution settings, and against deeper and more complex DNNs.

Result: 能够生成真实、情感丰富且音频同步的说话头视频，达到最先进性能

Conclusion: EmoCAST成功解决了情感说话头合成中的关键挑战，为实际应用提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Emotional talking head synthesis aims to generate talking portrait videos
with vivid expressions. Existing methods still exhibit limitations in control
flexibility, motion naturalness, and expression quality. Moreover, currently
available datasets are primarily collected in lab settings, further
exacerbating these shortcomings. Consequently, these limitations substantially
hinder practical applications in real-world scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose EmoCAST, a diffusion-based framework with two key
modules for precise text-driven emotional synthesis. In appearance modeling,
emotional prompts are integrated through a text-guided decoupled emotive
module, enhancing the spatial knowledge to improve emotion comprehension. To
improve the relationship between audio and emotion, we introduce an emotive
audio attention module to capture the interplay between controlled emotion and
driving audio, generating emotion-aware features to guide more precise facial
motion synthesis. Additionally, we construct an emotional talking head dataset
with comprehensive emotive text descriptions to optimize the framework's
performance. Based on the proposed dataset, we propose an emotion-aware
sampling training strategy and a progressive functional training strategy that
further improve the model's ability to capture nuanced expressive features and
achieve accurate lip-synchronization. Overall, EmoCAST achieves
state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic, emotionally expressive,
and audio-synchronized talking-head videos. Project Page:

Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality in
women, and early detection is essential for improving outcomes. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) is a highly sensitive tool for breast cancer detection,
particularly in women at high risk or with dense breast tissue, where
mammography is less effective. The ODELIA consortium organized a multi-center
challenge to foster AI-based solutions for breast cancer diagnosis and
classification. The dataset included 511 studies from six European centers,
acquired on scanners from multiple vendors at both 1.5 T and 3 T. Each study
was labeled for the left and right breast as no lesion, benign lesion, or
malignant lesion. We developed a SwinUNETR-based deep learning framework that
incorporates breast region masking, extensive data augmentation, and ensemble
learning to improve robustness and generalizability. Our method achieved second
place on the challenge leaderboard, highlighting its potential to support
clinical breast MRI interpretation. We publicly share our codebase at

TL;DR: AvatarBack是一个即插即用框架，通过生成身份一致的后视图伪图像和学习性空间对齐策略，解决了高斯溅射头像重建中后脑区域缺失的问题，显著提升了完整3D头像的重建质量。

Motivation: 现有基于高斯溅射的头像重建方法主要依赖正面视图图像，导致后脑区域重建质量差，存在几何不一致、结构模糊和真实感降低等问题，限制了重建头像的保真度。

Method: 提出AvatarBack框架，包含两个核心技术：主体特定生成器(SSG)从稀疏正面输入生成身份一致的后视图伪图像提供多视角监督；自适应空间对齐策略(ASA)使用可学习变换矩阵优化合成视图与3D高斯表示之间的几何对齐。

Conclusion: AvatarBack通过显式建模缺失的后脑区域，成功解决了高斯溅射头像重建中的后脑质量问题，为完整一致的3D高斯头像重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have significantly boosted the
reconstruction of head avatars, enabling high-quality facial modeling by
representing an 3D avatar as a collection of 3D Gaussians. However, existing
methods predominantly rely on frontal-view images, leaving the back-head poorly
constructed. This leads to geometric inconsistencies, structural blurring, and
reduced realism in the rear regions, ultimately limiting the fidelity of
reconstructed avatars. To address this challenge, we propose AvatarBack, a
novel plug-and-play framework specifically designed to reconstruct complete and
consistent 3D Gaussian avatars by explicitly modeling the missing back-head
regions. AvatarBack integrates two core technical innovations,i.e., the
Subject-specific Generator (SSG) and the Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy
(ASA). The former leverages a generative prior to synthesize
identity-consistent, plausible back-view pseudo-images from sparse frontal
inputs, providing robust multi-view supervision. To achieve precise geometric
alignment between these synthetic views and the 3D Gaussian representation, the
later employs learnable transformation matrices optimized during training,
effectively resolving inherent pose and coordinate discrepancies. Extensive
experiments on NeRSemble and K-hairstyle datasets, evaluated using geometric,
photometric, and GPT-4o-based perceptual metrics, demonstrate that AvatarBack
significantly enhances back-head reconstruction quality while preserving
frontal fidelity. Moreover, the reconstructed avatars maintain consistent
visual realism under diverse motions and remain fully animatable.

Abstract: Identifying sitters in historical paintings is a key task for art historians,
offering insight into their lives and how they chose to be seen. However, the
process is often subjective and limited by the lack of data and stylistic
variations. Automated facial recognition is capable of handling challenging
conditions and can assist, but while traditional facial recognition models
perform well on photographs, they struggle with paintings due to domain shift
and high intra-class variation. Artistic factors such as style, skill, intent,
and influence from other works further complicate recognition. In this work, we
investigate the potential of foundation models to improve facial recognition in
artworks. By fine-tuning foundation models and integrating their embeddings
with those from conventional facial recognition networks, we demonstrate
notable improvements over current state-of-the-art methods. Our results show
that foundation models can bridge the gap where traditional methods are
ineffective. Paper page at https://www.idiap.ch/paper/artface/

Motivation: 在涂鸦这种高对比度、抽象的艺术形式中，细微的面部特征扭曲会消除主体的可识别性，破坏个人和文化真实性。

Method: 使用LoRA微调的预训练扩散变换器进行涂鸦风格迁移，通过面部一致性自注意力机制增强身份嵌入，采用CLIP引导的提示扩展实现无关键点的姿态定制。

Conclusion: CraftGraffiti推进了身份尊重的AI辅助艺术目标，为创意AI应用中融合风格自由和可识别性提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Preserving facial identity under extreme stylistic transformation remains a
major challenge in generative art. In graffiti, a high-contrast, abstract
medium, subtle distortions to the eyes, nose, or mouth can erase the subject's
recognizability, undermining both personal and cultural authenticity. We
present CraftGraffiti, an end-to-end text-guided graffiti generation framework
designed with facial feature preservation as a primary objective. Given an
input image and a style and pose descriptive prompt, CraftGraffiti first
applies graffiti style transfer via LoRA-fine-tuned pretrained diffusion
transformer, then enforces identity fidelity through a face-consistent
self-attention mechanism that augments attention layers with explicit identity
embeddings. Pose customization is achieved without keypoints, using CLIP-guided
prompt extension to enable dynamic re-posing while retaining facial coherence.
We formally justify and empirically validate the "style-first, identity-after"
paradigm, showing it reduces attribute drift compared to the reverse order.
Quantitative results demonstrate competitive facial feature consistency and
state-of-the-art aesthetic and human preference scores, while qualitative
analyses and a live deployment at the Cruilla Festival highlight the system's
real-world creative impact. CraftGraffiti advances the goal of
identity-respectful AI-assisted artistry, offering a principled approach for
blending stylistic freedom with recognizability in creative AI applications.

Result: 实验结果显示该方法显著超过传统方法，有效减少了幻觉现象，提高了安全性和整体能力。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种更有效的视觉-语言模型对齐方案，通过自主自我评估实现了更好的模态对齐效果。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) have opened up new opportunities for integrating
visual and linguistic modalities. However, effectively aligning these
modalities remains challenging, often leading to hallucinations--where
generated outputs are not grounded in the visual input--and raising safety
concerns across various domains. Existing alignment methods, such as
instruction tuning and preference tuning, often rely on external datasets,
human annotations, or complex post-processing, which limit scalability and
increase costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
generates the debiased self-judgment score, a self-evaluation metric created
internally by the model without relying on external resources. This enables the
model to autonomously improve alignment. Our method enhances both decoding
strategies and preference tuning processes, resulting in reduced
hallucinations, enhanced safety, and improved overall capability. Empirical
results show that our approach significantly outperforms traditional methods,
offering a more effective solution for aligning LVLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal AI have enabled progress in detecting synthetic

intent behind AI-generated images. To fill this gap, we introduce S-HArM, a
multimodal dataset for intent-aware classification, comprising 9,576 "in the

or Misinformation. Additionally, we explore three prompting strategies
(image-guided, description-guided, and multimodally-guided) to construct a
large-scale synthetic training dataset with Stable Diffusion. We conduct an
extensive comparative study including modality fusion, contrastive learning,
reconstruction networks, attention mechanisms, and large vision-language
models. Our results show that models trained on image- and multimodally-guided
data generalize better to "in the wild" content, due to preserved visual
context. However, overall performance remains limited, highlighting the
complexity of inferring intent and the need for specialized architectures.

Conclusion: MobileCLIP2通过改进的训练方法在低延迟轻量级模型中实现了优异的零样本性能，为移动端多模态应用提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Foundation image-text models such as CLIP with zero-shot capabilities enable
a wide array of applications. MobileCLIP is a recent family of image-text
models at 3-15ms latency and 50-150M parameters with state-of-the-art zero-shot
accuracy. The main ingredients in MobileCLIP were its low-latency and light
architectures and a novel multi-modal reinforced training that made knowledge
distillation from multiple caption-generators and CLIP teachers efficient,
scalable, and reproducible. In this paper, we improve the multi-modal
reinforced training of MobileCLIP through: 1) better CLIP teacher ensembles
trained on the DFN dataset, 2) improved captioner teachers trained on the DFN
dataset and fine-tuned on a diverse selection of high-quality image-caption
datasets. We discover new insights through ablations such as the importance of
temperature tuning in contrastive knowledge distillation, the effectiveness of
caption-generator fine-tuning for caption diversity, and the additive
improvement from combining synthetic captions generated by multiple models. We
train a new family of models called MobileCLIP2 and achieve state-of-the-art
ImageNet-1k zero-shot accuracies at low latencies. In particular, we observe
2.2% improvement in ImageNet-1k accuracy for MobileCLIP2-B compared with
MobileCLIP-B architecture. Notably, MobileCLIP2-S4 matches the zero-shot
accuracy of SigLIP-SO400M/14 on ImageNet-1k while being 2$\times$ smaller and
improves on DFN ViT-L/14 at 2.5$\times$ lower latency. We release our
pretrained models (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip) and the data
generation code (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip-dr). The data

Conclusion: 该方法成功将因果推理模块化，CCE可作为跨领域可重用的因果推理引擎，为视频问答提供了透明且逻辑连贯的推理框架

Abstract: Existing Causal-Why Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models often struggle
with higher-order reasoning, relying on opaque, monolithic pipelines that
entangle video understanding, causal inference, and answer generation. These
black-box approaches offer limited interpretability and tend to depend on
shallow heuristics. We propose a novel, modular framework that explicitly
decouples causal reasoning from answer generation, introducing natural language
causal chains as interpretable intermediate representations. Inspired by human
cognitive models, these structured cause-effect sequences bridge low-level
video content with high-level causal reasoning, enabling transparent and
logically coherent inference. Our two-stage architecture comprises a Causal
Chain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs,
and a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that produces answers grounded in
these chains. To address the lack of annotated reasoning traces, we introduce a
scalable method for generating high-quality causal chains from existing
datasets using large language models. We also propose CauCo, a new evaluation
metric for causality-oriented captioning. Experiments on three large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art
models, but also yields substantial gains in explainability, user trust, and
generalization -- positioning the CCE as a reusable causal reasoning engine
across diverse domains. Project page:

Abstract: Neural Video Compression (NVC) has achieved remarkable performance in recent
years. However, precise rate control remains a challenge due to the inherent
limitations of learning-based codecs. To solve this issue, we propose a dynamic
video compression framework designed for variable bitrate scenarios. First, to
achieve variable bitrate implementation, we propose the Dynamic-Route
Autoencoder with variable coding routes, each occupying partial computational
complexity of the whole network and navigating to a distinct RD trade-off.
Second, to approach the target bitrate, the Rate Control Agent estimates the
bitrate of each route and adjusts the coding route of DRA at run time. To
encompass a broad spectrum of variable bitrates while preserving overall RD
performance, we employ the Joint-Routes Optimization strategy, achieving
collaborative training of various routes. Extensive experiments on the HEVC and
UVG datasets show that the proposed method achieves an average BD-Rate
reduction of 14.8% and BD-PSNR gain of 0.47dB over state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining an average bitrate error of 1.66%, achieving
Rate-Distortion-Complexity Optimization (RDCO) for various bitrate and

Abstract: Accurate cardiac motion estimation from cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
images is vital for assessing cardiac function and detecting its abnormalities.
Existing methods often struggle to capture heart motion accurately because they
rely on intensity-based image registration similarity losses that may overlook
cardiac anatomical regions. To address this, we propose CardioMorphNet, a
recurrent Bayesian deep learning framework for 3D cardiac shape-guided
deformable registration using short-axis (SAX) CMR images. It employs a
recurrent variational autoencoder to model spatio-temporal dependencies over
the cardiac cycle and two posterior models for bi-ventricular segmentation and
motion estimation. The derived loss function from the Bayesian formulation
guides the framework to focus on anatomical regions by recursively registering
segmentation maps without using intensity-based image registration similarity
loss, while leveraging sequential SAX volumes and spatio-temporal features. The
Bayesian modelling also enables computation of uncertainty maps for the
estimated motion fields. Validated on the UK Biobank dataset by comparing
warped mask shapes with ground truth masks, CardioMorphNet demonstrates
superior performance in cardiac motion estimation, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Uncertainty assessment shows that it also yields
lower uncertainty values for estimated motion fields in the cardiac region
compared with other probabilistic-based cardiac registration methods,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于非典型有丝分裂图像分类的领域鲁棒训练方法，通过风格扰动、注意力特征对齐和EMA教师蒸馏，在MIDOG 2025挑战赛中取得了优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非典型有丝分裂图像在组织病理学中是重要标记，但由于扫描仪、染色和采集差异导致的领域偏移，使其难以一致识别

Method: 采用三重策略：(i)在骨干网络早期和中期插入风格扰动增加特征多样性；(ii)使用弱域标签通过辅助对齐损失跨站点对齐注意力精炼特征；(iii)通过温度缩放KL散度从EMA教师模型蒸馏以稳定预测

Result: 在MIDOG 2025初步排行榜上获得平衡准确率0.8762、灵敏度0.8873、特异性0.8651、ROC AUC 0.9499的优异性能

Conclusion: 该方法推理时间开销可忽略，仅需粗粒度域元数据，提供强大且平衡的性能，是MIDOG 2025挑战赛的有竞争力方案

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are important histopathological markers yet
remain challenging to identify consistently, particularly under domain shift
stemming from scanner, stain, and acquisition differences. We present a simple
training-time recipe for domain-robust AMF classification in MIDOG 2025 Task 2.
The approach (i) increases feature diversity via style perturbations inserted
at early and mid backbone stages, (ii) aligns attention-refined features across
sites using weak domain labels (Scanner, Origin, Species, Tumor) through an
auxiliary alignment loss, and (iii) stabilizes predictions by distilling from
an exponential moving average (EMA) teacher with temperature-scaled KL
divergence. On the organizer-run preliminary leaderboard for atypical mitosis
classification, our submission attains balanced accuracy of 0.8762, sensitivity
of 0.8873, specificity of 0.8651, and ROC AUC of 0.9499. The method incurs
negligible inference-time overhead, relies only on coarse domain metadata, and
delivers strong, balanced performance, positioning it as a competitive
submission for the MIDOG 2025 challenge.

TL;DR: 提出Pref-GRPO方法解决基于点式奖励模型的奖励黑客问题，通过成对偏好比较实现更稳定的训练，并建立UniGenBench基准测试进行全面评估


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于点式奖励模型的文本到图像生成方法容易受到奖励黑客攻击，微小分数差异在归一化后被放大，导致模型过度优化琐碎增益而破坏生成稳定性

Method: Pref-GRPO采用成对偏好奖励方法，在每组图像中使用偏好奖励模型进行成对比较，以胜率作为奖励信号，将优化目标从分数最大化转为偏好拟合

Result: 实验表明Pref-GRPO能够区分细微的图像质量差异，提供更稳定的优势并缓解奖励黑客问题。UniGenBench基准测试揭示了开源和闭源T2I模型的优缺点

Conclusion: Pref-GRPO方法有效解决了奖励黑客问题，UniGenBench为全面评估文本到图像生成模型提供了统一基准，验证了新方法的有效性

Abstract: Recent advancements highlight the importance of GRPO-based reinforcement
learning methods and benchmarking in enhancing text-to-image (T2I) generation.
However, current methods using pointwise reward models (RM) for scoring
generated images are susceptible to reward hacking. We reveal that this happens
when minimal score differences between images are amplified after
normalization, creating illusory advantages that drive the model to
over-optimize for trivial gains, ultimately destabilizing the image generation
process. To address this, we propose Pref-GRPO, a pairwise preference
reward-based GRPO method that shifts the optimization objective from score
maximization to preference fitting, ensuring more stable training. In
Pref-GRPO, images are pairwise compared within each group using preference RM,
and the win rate is used as the reward signal. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PREF-GRPO differentiates subtle image quality differences,
providing more stable advantages and mitigating reward hacking. Additionally,
existing T2I benchmarks are limited by coarse evaluation criteria, hindering
comprehensive model assessment. To solve this, we introduce UniGenBench, a
unified T2I benchmark comprising 600 prompts across 5 main themes and 20
subthemes. It evaluates semantic consistency through 10 primary and 27
sub-criteria, leveraging MLLM for benchmark construction and evaluation. Our
benchmarks uncover the strengths and weaknesses of both open and closed-source
T2I models and validate the effectiveness of Pref-GRPO.

TL;DR: C3-GS是一个通用高斯溅射框架，通过上下文感知、跨维度和跨尺度约束增强特征学习，无需逐场景优化即可实现高质量新视角合成


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在稀疏输入视图下难以编码判别性、多视图一致的特征来预测高斯参数，导致几何构建不准确

Method: 在统一渲染管道中集成三个轻量级模块，引入上下文感知、跨维度和跨尺度约束来改进特征融合

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验验证了C3-GS实现了最先进的渲染质量和泛化能力

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现照片级真实感合成，且不需要额外的监督，代码已开源

Abstract: Generalizable Gaussian Splatting aims to synthesize novel views for unseen
scenes without per-scene optimization. In particular, recent advancements
utilize feed-forward networks to predict per-pixel Gaussian parameters,
enabling high-quality synthesis from sparse input views. However, existing
approaches fall short in encoding discriminative, multi-view consistent
features for Gaussian predictions, which struggle to construct accurate
geometry with sparse views. To address this, we propose $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS, a
framework that enhances feature learning by incorporating context-aware,
cross-dimension, and cross-scale constraints. Our architecture integrates three
lightweight modules into a unified rendering pipeline, improving feature fusion
and enabling photorealistic synthesis without requiring additional supervision.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate that $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS
achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and generalization ability. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeqVLM是一个新颖的零样本3D视觉定位框架，通过多视角真实场景图像和空间信息进行目标物体推理，在ScanRefer和Nr3D基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的零样本3D视觉定位方法面临空间推理受限、上下文信息遗漏和细节退化等挑战，需要消除场景特定训练需求以更好地适应现实世界应用。

Method: 首先通过3D语义分割网络生成3D实例提议，并通过语义过滤进行精炼；然后使用提议引导的多视角投影策略将候选提议投影到真实场景图像序列中；最后通过动态调度机制迭代处理序列查询提示，利用VLM的跨模态推理能力识别文本指定的对象。

Result: 在ScanRefer和Nr3D基准测试中分别达到55.6%和53.2%的Acc@0.25分数，比之前的零样本方法分别提升了4.0%和5.2%。

Conclusion: SeqVLM框架通过多视角推理和空间信息利用，显著提升了零样本3D视觉定位的性能，推动了3DVG向更好泛化能力和现实世界适用性的发展。

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize objects in 3D scenes using
natural language descriptions. Although supervised methods achieve higher
accuracy in constrained settings, zero-shot 3DVG holds greater promise for
real-world applications since eliminating scene-specific training requirements.
However, existing zero-shot methods face challenges of spatial-limited
reasoning due to reliance on single-view localization, and contextual omissions
or detail degradation. To address these issues, we propose SeqVLM, a novel
zero-shot 3DVG framework that leverages multi-view real-world scene images with
spatial information for target object reasoning. Specifically, SeqVLM first
generates 3D instance proposals via a 3D semantic segmentation network and
refines them through semantic filtering, retaining only semantic-relevant
candidates. A proposal-guided multi-view projection strategy then projects
these candidate proposals onto real scene image sequences, preserving spatial
relationships and contextual details in the conversion process of 3D point
cloud to images. Furthermore, to mitigate VLM computational overload, we
implement a dynamic scheduling mechanism that iteratively processes
sequances-query prompts, leveraging VLM's cross-modal reasoning capabilities to
identify textually specified objects. Experiments on the ScanRefer and Nr3D
benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving Acc@0.25 scores
of 55.6% and 53.2%, surpassing previous zero-shot methods by 4.0% and 5.2%,
respectively, which advance 3DVG toward greater generalization and real-world
applicability. The code is available at https://github.com/JiawLin/SeqVLM.

TL;DR: CLIP模型在军事车辆识别中对遮挡的鲁棒性研究，发现Transformer架构优于CNN，分散遮挡比连续遮挡影响更大，微调可显著提升抗遮挡能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索CLIP视觉语言模型在军事环境中面对部分遮挡和信噪比下降等挑战时的鲁棒性，为国防应用中稀缺标注数据场景提供解决方案

Method: 使用18类军事车辆自定义数据集，评估不同CLIP变体对遮挡的鲁棒性，采用归一化曲线下面积(NAUC)指标，分析不同遮挡比例下的性能表现

Result: 1) Transformer-based CLIP优于CNN模型 2) 细粒度分散遮挡比大块连续遮挡影响更大 3) 线性探测模型在35%遮挡时性能急剧下降 4) 骨干网络微调后性能在60%遮挡时才显著下降

Conclusion: 需要在训练中加入遮挡特定增强，进一步研究补丁级敏感性和架构韧性，以提高CLIP在真实军事部署中的实用性

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared embedding space, offering advantages for
defense applications with scarce labeled data. However, CLIP's robustness in
challenging military environments, with partial occlusion and degraded
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), remains underexplored. We investigate CLIP
variants' robustness to occlusion using a custom dataset of 18 military vehicle
classes and evaluate using Normalized Area Under the Curve (NAUC) across
occlusion percentages. Four key insights emerge: (1) Transformer-based CLIP
models consistently outperform CNNs, (2) fine-grained, dispersed occlusions
degrade performance more than larger contiguous occlusions, (3) despite
improved accuracy, performance of linear-probed models sharply drops at around
35% occlusion, (4) by finetuning the model's backbone, this performance drop
occurs at more than 60% occlusion. These results underscore the importance of
occlusion-specific augmentations during training and the need for further
exploration into patch-level sensitivity and architectural resilience for
real-world deployment of CLIP.

Conclusion: 该架构通过结合Swin Transformer和跳跃连接，有效提升了自动驾驶模型的环境感知和理解能力，为端到端自动驾驶系统提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Focusing on the development of an end-to-end autonomous vehicle model with
pixel-to-pixel context awareness, this research proposes the SKGE-Swin
architecture. This architecture utilizes the Swin Transformer with a skip-stage
mechanism to broaden feature representation globally and at various network
levels. This approach enables the model to extract information from distant
pixels by leveraging the Swin Transformer's Shifted Window-based Multi-head
Self-Attention (SW-MSA) mechanism and to retain critical information from the
initial to the final stages of feature extraction, thereby enhancing its
capability to comprehend complex patterns in the vehicle's surroundings. The
model is evaluated on the CARLA platform using adversarial scenarios to
simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the
SKGE-Swin architecture achieves a superior Driving Score compared to previous
methods. Furthermore, an ablation study will be conducted to evaluate the
contribution of each architectural component, including the influence of skip
connections and the use of the Swin Transformer, in improving model
performance.

Motivation: 虽然机器在视频内容的具体实体识别方面取得进展，但人类独有的抽象概念识别能力（如正义、自由、团结等）仍是视频理解的关键开放挑战，需要基于上下文信息进行多层级语义推理。

Method: 通过研究视频抽象概念理解的不同任务和数据集，分析研究人员如何利用现有工具解决这些任务，并倡导在基础模型时代借鉴数十年社区经验。

Conclusion: 利用多模态基础模型时代重新审视视频抽象概念理解这一重要开放挑战时，借鉴数十年的社区经验将有助于避免重复工作，推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: The automatic understanding of video content is advancing rapidly. Empowered
by deeper neural networks and large datasets, machines are increasingly capable
of understanding what is concretely visible in video frames, whether it be
objects, actions, events, or scenes. In comparison, humans retain a unique
ability to also look beyond concrete entities and recognize abstract concepts
like justice, freedom, and togetherness. Abstract concept recognition forms a
crucial open challenge in video understanding, where reasoning on multiple
semantic levels based on contextual information is key. In this paper, we argue
that the recent advances in foundation models make for an ideal setting to
address abstract concept understanding in videos. Automated understanding of
high-level abstract concepts is imperative as it enables models to be more
aligned with human reasoning and values. In this survey, we study different
tasks and datasets used to understand abstract concepts in video content. We
observe that, periodically and over a long period, researchers have attempted
to solve these tasks, making the best use of the tools available at their
disposal. We advocate that drawing on decades of community experience will help
us shed light on this important open grand challenge and avoid ``re-inventing
the wheel'' as we start revisiting it in the era of multi-modal foundation
models.

Motivation: 虽然皮肤病变分类模型的准确性已超越皮肤科医生，但医疗实践中对AI模型的不信任仍是挑战。现有可解释性方法存在可靠性问题，需要更可信、可解释的诊断方法。

Method: 提出Global Class Activation Probabilistic Map Evaluation方法，在像素级别概率性分析所有类别的激活概率地图，通过统一的可解释可视化减少误诊风险。同时集成SafeML检测假诊断和发出警告。

Result: 使用ISIC数据集进行评估，采用MobileNetV2和Vision Transformers模型进行实验。

Conclusion: 该方法能够提高皮肤病变分类模型的可解释性和可靠性，通过更可信的诊断过程提升医生和病人对AI诊断的信任度，最终提高病人安全性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in skin lesion classification models have significantly
improved accuracy, with some models even surpassing dermatologists' diagnostic
performance. However, in medical practice, distrust in AI models remains a
challenge. Beyond high accuracy, trustworthy, explainable diagnoses are
essential. Existing explainability methods have reliability issues, with
LIME-based methods suffering from inconsistency, while CAM-based methods
failing to consider all classes. To address these limitations, we propose
Global Class Activation Probabilistic Map Evaluation, a method that analyses
all classes' activation probability maps probabilistically and at a pixel
level. By visualizing the diagnostic process in a unified manner, it helps
reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. Furthermore, the application of SafeML
enhances the detection of false diagnoses and issues warnings to doctors and
patients as needed, improving diagnostic reliability and ultimately patient
safety. We evaluated our method using the ISIC datasets with MobileNetV2 and
Vision Transformers.

*Beth Pearson,Bilal Boulbarss,Michael Wray,Martha Lewis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了扩散分类器在组合泛化能力方面是否优于判别式模型（如CLIP和ViLT），特别是在对象-属性绑定和关系推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言语义的一个基本方面是能够从已知部分组合出新含义。虽然视觉语言模型（VLMs）取得了显著进展，但有证据表明它们在组合推理方面存在困难，例如容易产生错误的组合标签。扩散模型在生成任务中表现出色，但其在组合泛化方面的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 评估三种模型（扩散分类器、CLIP和ViLT）在零样本学习（ZSL）和广义零样本学习（GZSL）设置下的对象-属性绑定和关系推理能力。通过分析模型在概念绑定任务中的表现来评估其组合泛化能力。

Result: 扩散分类器和ViLT在概念绑定任务中表现良好，但所有模型在关系GZSL任务中都面临显著困难。CLIP嵌入分析表明，困难可能源于关系概念（如左右）的表征过于相似。

Conclusion: 虽然扩散分类器在某些组合任务中表现优于CLIP，但所有视觉语言模型在关系推理方面都存在根本性挑战，这凸显了改进VLMs关系表示的必要性。

Abstract: A fundamental aspect of the semantics of natural language is that novel
meanings can be formed from the composition of previously known parts.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in recent years,
however, there is evidence that they are unable to perform this kind of
composition. For example, given an image of a red cube and a blue cylinder, a
VLM such as CLIP is likely to incorrectly label the image as a red cylinder or
a blue cube, indicating it represents the image as a `bag-of-words' and fails
to capture compositional semantics. Diffusion models have recently gained
significant attention for their impressive generative abilities, and zero-shot
classifiers based on diffusion models have been shown to perform competitively
with CLIP in certain compositional tasks. In this work we explore whether the
generative Diffusion Classifier has improved compositional generalisation
abilities compared to discriminative models. We assess three models --
Diffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT -- on their ability to bind objects with
attributes and relations in both zero-shot learning (ZSL) and generalised
zero-shot learning (GZSL) settings. Our results show that the Diffusion
Classifier and ViLT perform well at concept binding tasks, but that all models
struggle significantly with the relational GZSL task, underscoring the broader
challenges VLMs face with relational reasoning. Analysis of CLIP embeddings
suggests that the difficulty may stem from overly similar representations of
relational concepts such as left and right. Code and dataset are available at:

Conclusion: 提出的surfel-based pose learning regression方法能够有效解决点云配准中的方向不确定性和噪声敏感问题，在多个数据集上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Point cloud registration is crucial for ensuring 3D alignment consistency of
multiple local point clouds in 3D reconstruction for remote sensing or digital
heritage. While various point cloud-based registration methods exist, both
non-learning and learning-based, they ignore point orientations and point
uncertainties, making the model susceptible to noisy input and aggressive
rotations of the input point cloud like orthogonal transformation; thus, it
necessitates extensive training point clouds with transformation augmentations.
To address these issues, we propose a novel surfel-based pose learning
regression approach. Our method can initialize surfels from Lidar point cloud
using virtual perspective camera parameters, and learns explicit
$\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant features, including both position and rotation
through $\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant convolutional kernels to predict relative
transformation between source and target scans. The model comprises an
equivariant convolutional encoder, a cross-attention mechanism for similarity
computation, a fully-connected decoder, and a non-linear Huber loss.
Experimental results on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate our model
superiority and robust performance on real point-cloud scans compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 实验结果表明，DVCTNet在公共数据集和新构建的高精度数据集上都优于现有最先进方法，证明了其临床适用性。

Conclusion: DVCTNet通过双视图协同训练和特征融合，有效提高了牙科龋齿检测的准确性，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: Accurate dental caries detection from panoramic X-rays plays a pivotal role
in preventing lesion progression. However, current detection methods often
yield suboptimal accuracy due to subtle contrast variations and diverse lesion
morphology of dental caries. In this work, inspired by the clinical workflow
where dentists systematically combine whole-image screening with detailed
tooth-level inspection, we present DVCTNet, a novel Dual-View Co-Training
network for accurate dental caries detection. Our DVCTNet starts with employing
automated tooth detection to establish two complementary views: a global view
from panoramic X-ray images and a local view from cropped tooth images. We then
pretrain two vision foundation models separately on the two views. The
global-view foundation model serves as the detection backbone, generating
region proposals and global features, while the local-view model extracts
detailed features from corresponding cropped tooth patches matched by the
region proposals. To effectively integrate information from both views, we
introduce a Gated Cross-View Attention (GCV-Atten) module that dynamically
fuses dual-view features, enhancing the detection pipeline by integrating the
fused features back into the detection model for final caries detection. To
rigorously evaluate our DVCTNet, we test it on a public dataset and further
validate its performance on a newly curated, high-precision dental caries
detection dataset, annotated using both intra-oral images and panoramic X-rays
for double verification. Experimental results demonstrate DVCTNet's superior
performance against existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both datasets,
indicating the clinical applicability of our method. Our code and labeled
dataset are available at https://github.com/ShanghaiTech-IMPACT/DVCTNet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了FusionCounting框架，将可见光和红外图像融合与人群计数结合，通过多任务学习和动态损失加权策略，在提升图像融合质量的同时实现优越的人群计数性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VIF方法主要关注图像质量优化，虽然近期研究开始结合语义分割和目标检测等下游任务，但这些方法需要大量标注或在高密度场景中面临边界框重叠和遮挡问题。RGB-T人群计数虽受关注但尚未与VIF整合。

Method: 提出多任务学习框架FusionCounting，将人群计数集成到VIF过程中。采用动态损失函数加权策略加速收敛和平衡任务贡献，并引入对抗训练增强模型鲁棒性。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验结果表明，FusionCounting不仅提升了图像融合质量，还实现了优越的人群计数性能。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了高密度场景中VIF与人群计数的整合问题，通过最小化标注需求实现了多任务的协同优化，为密集场景下的视觉应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Most visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) methods focus primarily on
optimizing fused image quality. Recent studies have begun incorporating
downstream tasks, such as semantic segmentation and object detection, to
provide semantic guidance for VIF. However, semantic segmentation requires
extensive annotations, while object detection, despite reducing annotation
efforts compared with segmentation, faces challenges in highly crowded scenes
due to overlapping bounding boxes and occlusion. Moreover, although RGB-T crowd
counting has gained increasing attention in recent years, no studies have
integrated VIF and crowd counting into a unified framework. To address these
challenges, we propose FusionCounting, a novel multi-task learning framework
that integrates crowd counting into the VIF process. Crowd counting provides a
direct quantitative measure of population density with minimal annotation,
making it particularly suitable for dense scenes. Our framework leverages both
input images and population density information in a mutually beneficial
multi-task design. To accelerate convergence and balance tasks contributions,
we introduce a dynamic loss function weighting strategy. Furthermore, we
incorporate adversarial training to enhance the robustness of both VIF and
crowd counting, improving the model's stability and resilience to adversarial
attacks. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that
FusionCounting not only enhances image fusion quality but also achieves
superior crowd counting performance.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了关键点检测性能，为未来3D手术手和工具姿势估计研究铺平了道路。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel pipeline for 2D keypoint estima- tion of surgical
tools by leveraging Vision Language Models (VLMs) fine- tuned using a low rank
adjusting (LoRA) technique. Unlike traditional Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) or Transformer-based approaches, which often suffer from overfitting in
small-scale medical datasets, our method harnesses the generalization
capabilities of pre-trained VLMs. We carefully design prompts to create an
instruction-tuning dataset and use them to align visual features with semantic
keypoint descriptions. Experimental results show that with only two epochs of
fine tuning, the adapted VLM outperforms the baseline models, demonstrating the
ef- fectiveness of LoRA in low-resource scenarios. This approach not only
improves keypoint detection performance, but also paves the way for future work
in 3D surgical hands and tools pose estimation.

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) has been recently explored to enhance the
generalizability of Point Cloud Classification (PCC) models toward unseen
domains. Prior works are based on convolutional networks, Transformer or Mamba
architectures, either suffering from limited receptive fields or high
computational cost, or insufficient long-range dependency modeling. RWKV, as an
emerging architecture, possesses superior linear complexity, global receptive
fields, and long-range dependency. In this paper, we present the first work
that studies the generalizability of RWKV models in DG PCC. We find that
directly applying RWKV to DG PCC encounters two significant challenges: RWKV's
fixed direction token shift methods, like Q-Shift, introduce spatial
distortions when applied to unstructured point clouds, weakening local
geometric modeling and reducing robustness. In addition, the Bi-WKV attention
in RWKV amplifies slight cross-domain differences in key distributions through
exponential weighting, leading to attention shifts and degraded generalization.
To this end, we propose PointDGRWKV, the first RWKV-based framework tailored
for DG PCC. It introduces two key modules to enhance spatial modeling and
cross-domain robustness, while maintaining RWKV's linear efficiency. In
particular, we present Adaptive Geometric Token Shift to model local
neighborhood structures to improve geometric context awareness. In addition,
Cross-Domain key feature Distribution Alignment is designed to mitigate
attention drift by aligning key feature distributions across domains. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PointDGRWKV achieves
state-of-the-art performance on DG PCC.

Motivation: 解决深度学习病理诊断中模型决策不透明、缺乏可追溯依据的问题，提供透明可解释的AI辅助病理诊断。

Method: 提出PathMR框架，基于多模态视觉推理架构，给定病理图像和文本查询，生成像素级分割掩码和语义对齐的文本解释，同时预测细胞分布模式。

Conclusion: PathMR展示了在AI驱动病理诊断中提高可解释性的潜力，代码将公开提供。

Abstract: Deep learning based automated pathological diagnosis has markedly improved
diagnostic efficiency and reduced variability between observers, yet its
clinical adoption remains limited by opaque model decisions and a lack of
traceable rationale. To address this, recent multimodal visual reasoning
architectures provide a unified framework that generates segmentation masks at
the pixel level alongside semantically aligned textual explanations. By
localizing lesion regions and producing expert style diagnostic narratives,
these models deliver the transparent and interpretable insights necessary for
dependable AI assisted pathology. Building on these advancements, we propose
PathMR, a cell-level Multimodal visual Reasoning framework for Pathological
image analysis. Given a pathological image and a textual query, PathMR
generates expert-level diagnostic explanations while simultaneously predicting
cell distribution patterns. To benchmark its performance, we evaluated our
approach on the publicly available PathGen dataset as well as on our newly
developed GADVR dataset. Extensive experiments on these two datasets
demonstrate that PathMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art visual
reasoning methods in text generation quality, segmentation accuracy, and
cross-modal alignment. These results highlight the potential of PathMR for
improving interpretability in AI-driven pathological diagnosis. The code will
be publicly available in https://github.com/zhangye-zoe/PathMR.

Motivation: 胰腺导管腺癌生存率极低（5年生存率<10%），主要原因是晚期检测，需要开发早期检测方法

Method: 使用40个患者样本，分析自发荧光和二次谐波成像，比较6种深度学习架构（CNN和ViT），采用改进的ResNet架构，包含冻结预训练层和类别加权训练

Result: 最终优化的框架在癌症检测中达到超过90%的准确率，显著优于当前手动分析方法

Conclusion: 建立了自动化PDAC检测的稳健流程，可增强病理学家能力，并为扩展到其他癌症类型提供基础，对有限医疗影像数据集深度学习方法提供宝贵见解

Abstract: Pacreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal forms
of cancer, with a five-year survival rate below 10% primarily due to late
detection. This research develops and validates a deep learning framework for
early PDAC detection through analysis of dual-modality imaging:
autofluorescence and second harmonic generation (SHG). We analyzed 40 unique
patient samples to create a specialized neural network capable of
distinguishing between normal, fibrotic, and cancerous tissue. Our methodology
evaluated six distinct deep learning architectures, comparing traditional
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with modern Vision Transformers (ViTs).
Through systematic experimentation, we identified and overcome significant
challenges in medical image analysis, including limited dataset size and class
imbalance. The final optimized framework, based on a modified ResNet
architecture with frozen pre-trained layers and class-weighted training,
achieved over 90% accuracy in cancer detection. This represents a significant
improvement over current manual analysis methods an demonstrates potential for
clinical deployment. This work establishes a robust pipeline for automated PDAC
detection that can augment pathologists' capabilities while providing a
foundation for future expansion to other cancer types. The developed
methodology also offers valuable insights for applying deep learning to
limited-size medical imaging datasets, a common challenge in clinical
applications.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了基于反事实推理的框架，用于解释、审计和减轻视觉分类器和生成模型中的偏见，包括CAVLI、ASAC、TIBET、BiasConnect和InterMit等方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反事实推理在可解释和公平AI中变得至关重要，需要开发系统方法来发现虚假相关性、探索因果依赖关系，并构建更鲁棒的系统。

Method: 通过系统性地改变语义上有意义的属性同时保持其他属性固定，整合归因分析和概念级分析，使用对抗性反事实和课程学习，构建因果图和模块化算法。

Result: 开发了能够量化决策对概念依赖程度的方法，提高了模型的公平性和准确性，实现了可扩展的偏见评估和缓解。

Conclusion: 反事实推理为判别性和生成性模型中的可解释性、公平性和因果性提供了统一的视角，建立了原则性、可扩展的社会责任偏见评估和缓解方法。

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning -- the practice of asking ``what if'' by varying
inputs and observing changes in model behavior -- has become central to
interpretable and fair AI. This thesis develops frameworks that use
counterfactuals to explain, audit, and mitigate bias in vision classifiers and
generative models. By systematically altering semantically meaningful
attributes while holding others fixed, these methods uncover spurious
correlations, probe causal dependencies, and help build more robust systems.
  The first part addresses vision classifiers. CAVLI integrates attribution
(LIME) with concept-level analysis (TCAV) to quantify how strongly decisions
rely on human-interpretable concepts. With localized heatmaps and a Concept
Dependency Score, CAVLI shows when models depend on irrelevant cues like
backgrounds. Extending this, ASAC introduces adversarial counterfactuals that
perturb protected attributes while preserving semantics. Through curriculum
learning, ASAC fine-tunes biased models for improved fairness and accuracy
while avoiding stereotype-laden artifacts.
  The second part targets generative Text-to-Image (TTI) models. TIBET provides
a scalable pipeline for evaluating prompt-sensitive biases by varying
identity-related terms, enabling causal auditing of how race, gender, and age
affect image generation. To capture interactions, BiasConnect builds causal
graphs diagnosing intersectional biases. Finally, InterMit offers a modular,
training-free algorithm that mitigates intersectional bias via causal
sensitivity scores and user-defined fairness goals.
  Together, these contributions show counterfactuals as a unifying lens for
interpretability, fairness, and causality in both discriminative and generative
models, establishing principled, scalable methods for socially responsible bias
evaluation and mitigation.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle perception typically relies on modular pipelines that
decompose the task into detection, tracking, and prediction. While
interpretable, these pipelines suffer from error accumulation and limited
inter-task synergy. Unified perception has emerged as a promising paradigm that
integrates these sub-tasks within a shared architecture, potentially improving
robustness, contextual reasoning, and efficiency while retaining interpretable
outputs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of unified
perception, introducing a holistic and systemic taxonomy that categorizes
methods along task integration, tracking formulation, and representation flow.
We define three paradigms -Early, Late, and Full Unified Perception- and
systematically review existing methods, their architectures, training
strategies, datasets used, and open-source availability, while highlighting
future research directions. This work establishes the first comprehensive
framework for understanding and advancing unified perception, consolidates
fragmented efforts, and guides future research toward more robust,
generalizable, and interpretable perception.

Conclusion: 利用通用基础模型的优越密集预训练特征，为提升医学图像分割精度提供了一种高效且参数效率高的方法。

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on large-scale natural image datasets offer a
powerful paradigm for medical image segmentation. However, effectively
transferring their learned representations for precise clinical applications
remains a challenge. In this work, we propose Dino U-Net, a novel
encoder-decoder architecture designed to exploit the high-fidelity dense
features of the DINOv3 vision foundation model. Our architecture introduces an
encoder built upon a frozen DINOv3 backbone, which employs a specialized
adapter to fuse the model's rich semantic features with low-level spatial
details. To preserve the quality of these representations during dimensionality
reduction, we design a new fidelity-aware projection module (FAPM) that
effectively refines and projects the features for the decoder. We conducted
extensive experiments on seven diverse public medical image segmentation
datasets. Our results show that Dino U-Net achieves state-of-the-art
performance, consistently outperforming previous methods across various imaging
modalities. Our framework proves to be highly scalable, with segmentation
accuracy consistently improving as the backbone model size increases up to the
7-billion-parameter variant. The findings demonstrate that leveraging the
superior, dense-pretrained features from a general-purpose foundation model
provides a highly effective and parameter-efficient approach to advance the
accuracy of medical image segmentation. The code is available at

Abstract: Mitotic figures (MFs) are relevant biomarkers in tumor grading.
Differentiating atypical MFs (AMFs) from normal MFs (NMFs) remains difficult,
as manual annotation is time-consuming and subjective. In this work an ensemble
of ConvNeXtBase models was trained with AUCMEDI and extend with a rule-based
refinement (RBR) module. On the MIDOG25 preliminary test set, the ensemble
achieved a balanced accuracy of 84.02%. While the RBR increased specificity, it
reduced sensitivity and overall performance. The results show that deep
ensembles perform well for AMF classification. RBR can increase specific
metrics but requires further research.

Abstract: In the era of Industry 5.0, monitoring human activity is essential for
ensuring both ergonomic safety and overall well-being. While multi-camera
centralized setups improve pose estimation accuracy, they often suffer from
high computational costs and bandwidth requirements, limiting scalability and
real-time applicability. Distributing processing across edge devices can reduce
network bandwidth and computational load. On the other hand, the constrained
resources of edge devices lead to accuracy degradation, and the distribution of
computation leads to temporal and spatial inconsistencies. We address this
challenge by proposing COMETH (Convex Optimization for Multiview Estimation and
Tracking of Humans), a lightweight algorithm for real-time multi-view human
pose fusion that relies on three concepts: it integrates kinematic and
biomechanical constraints to increase the joint positioning accuracy; it
employs convex optimization-based inverse kinematics for spatial fusion; and it
implements a state observer to improve temporal consistency. We evaluate COMETH
on both public and industrial datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in localization, detection, and tracking accuracy. The proposed fusion
pipeline enables accurate and scalable human motion tracking, making it
well-suited for industrial and safety-critical applications. The code is
publicly available at https://github.com/PARCO-LAB/COMETH.

Abstract: Many high-performance networks were not designed with lightweight application
scenarios in mind from the outset, which has greatly restricted their scope of
application. This paper takes ConvNeXt as the research object and significantly
reduces the parameter scale and network complexity of ConvNeXt by integrating
the Cross Stage Partial Connections mechanism and a series of optimized

performance under different complexity configurations. The three core
innovations of E-ConvNeXt are : (1) integrating the Cross Stage Partial Network
(CSPNet) with ConvNeXt and adjusting the network structure, which reduces the
model's network complexity by up to 80%; (2) Optimizing the Stem and Block
structures to enhance the model's feature expression capability and operational
efficiency; (3) Replacing Layer Scale with channel attention. Experimental

Abstract: Images manipulated using image editing tools can mislead viewers and pose
significant risks to social security. However, accurately localizing the
manipulated regions within an image remains a challenging problem. One of the
main barriers in this area is the high cost of data acquisition and the severe
lack of high-quality annotated datasets. To address this challenge, we
introduce novel methods that mitigate data scarcity by leveraging readily
available web data. We utilize a large collection of manually forged images
from the web, as well as automatically generated annotations derived from a
simpler auxiliary task, constrained image manipulation localization.
Specifically, we introduce a new paradigm CAAAv2, which automatically and
accurately annotates manipulated regions at the pixel level. To further improve
annotation quality, we propose a novel metric, QES, which filters out
unreliable annotations. Through CAAA v2 and QES, we construct MIMLv2, a
large-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset containing 246,212 manually
forged images with pixel-level mask annotations. This is over 120x larger than
existing handcrafted datasets like IMD20. Additionally, we introduce Object
Jitter, a technique that further enhances model training by generating
high-quality manipulation artifacts. Building on these advances, we develop a
new model, Web-IML, designed to effectively leverage web-scale supervision for
the image manipulation localization task. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach substantially alleviates the data scarcity problem and
significantly improves the performance of various models on multiple real-world
forgery benchmarks. With the proposed web supervision, Web-IML achieves a
striking performance gain of 31% and surpasses previous SOTA TruFor by 24.1
average IoU points. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at

Abstract: Simulating detector responses is a crucial part of understanding the inner
workings of particle collisions in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Such
simulations are currently performed with statistical Monte Carlo methods, which
are computationally expensive and put a significant strain on CERN's
computational grid. Therefore, recent proposals advocate for generative machine
learning methods to enable more efficient simulations. However, the
distribution of the data varies significantly across the simulations, which is
hard to capture with out-of-the-box methods. In this study, we present
ExpertSim - a deep learning simulation approach tailored for the Zero Degree
Calorimeter in the ALICE experiment. Our method utilizes a
Mixture-of-Generative-Experts architecture, where each expert specializes in
simulating a different subset of the data. This allows for a more precise and
efficient generation process, as each expert focuses on a specific aspect of
the calorimeter response. ExpertSim not only improves accuracy, but also
provides a significant speedup compared to the traditional Monte-Carlo methods,
offering a promising solution for high-efficiency detector simulations in
particle physics experiments at CERN. We make the code available at

Abstract: The field of video diffusion generation faces critical bottlenecks in
sampling efficiency, especially for large-scale models and long sequences.
Existing video acceleration methods adopt image-based techniques but suffer
from fundamental limitations: they neither model the temporal coherence of
video frames nor provide single-step distillation for large-scale video models.
To bridge this gap, we propose POSE (Phased One-Step Equilibrium), a
distillation framework that reduces the sampling steps of large-scale video
diffusion models, enabling the generation of high-quality videos in a single
step. POSE employs a carefully designed two-phase process to distill video
models:(i) stability priming: a warm-up mechanism to stabilize adversarial
distillation that adapts the high-quality trajectory of the one-step generator
from high to low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, optimizing the video quality of
single-step mappings near the endpoints of flow trajectories. (ii) unified
adversarial equilibrium: a flexible self-adversarial distillation mechanism
that promotes stable single-step adversarial training towards a Nash
equilibrium within the Gaussian noise space, generating realistic single-step
videos close to real videos. For conditional video generation, we propose (iii)
conditional adversarial consistency, a method to improve both semantic
consistency and frame consistency between conditional frames and generated
frames. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that POSE outperforms other
acceleration methods on VBench-I2V by average 7.15% in semantic alignment,
temporal conference and frame quality, reducing the latency of the pre-trained
model by 100$\times$, from 1000 seconds to 10 seconds, while maintaining
competitive performance.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models enable high-quality image generation but are
computationally expensive. While prior work optimizes per-inference efficiency,
we explore an orthogonal approach: reducing redundancy across correlated
prompts. Our method leverages the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion models,
where early denoising steps capture shared structures among similar prompts. We
propose a training-free approach that clusters prompts based on semantic
similarity and shares computation in early diffusion steps. Experiments show
that for models trained conditioned on image embeddings, our approach
significantly reduces compute cost while improving image quality. By leveraging
UnClip's text-to-image prior, we enhance diffusion step allocation for greater
efficiency. Our method seamlessly integrates with existing pipelines, scales
with prompt sets, and reduces the environmental and financial burden of
large-scale text-to-image generation. Project page:

Motivation: 组织学图像中的有线分裂检测对肿瘤评估至关重要，但机器学习算法在不同域图像上性能下降明显，需要解决域偏移问题

Method: 提出Mamba基础的VM-UNet网络架构，统一进行有线分裂检测任务，并使用某测增强操作来提高模型对域偏移的葬性

Result: 在MIDOG++数据集上进行的初步实验显示，该方法仍有较大的改进空间

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种基于Mamba的方法来应对有线分裂检测中的域偏移问题，虽然目前性能仍有提升空间，但为该领域提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Mitosis detection in histopathology images plays a key role in tumor
assessment. Although machine learning algorithms could be exploited for aiding
physicians in accurately performing such a task, these algorithms suffer from
significative performance drop when evaluated on images coming from domains
that are different from the training ones. In this work, we propose a
Mamba-based approach for mitosis detection under domain shift, inspired by the
promising performance demonstrated by Mamba in medical imaging segmentation
tasks. Specifically, our approach exploits a VM-UNet architecture for carrying
out the addressed task, as well as stain augmentation operations for further
improving model robustness against domain shift. Our approach has been
submitted to the track 1 of the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG)
challenge. Preliminary experiments, conducted on the MIDOG++ dataset, show
large room for improvement for the proposed method.

Abstract: Recognizing atypical mitotic figures in histopathology images allows
physicians to correctly assess tumor aggressiveness. Although machine learning
models could be exploited for automatically performing such a task, under
domain shift these models suffer from significative performance drops. In this
work, an approach based on multi-task learning is proposed for addressing this

object to classify, ignoring the domain varying background of the image. The
proposed approach shows promising performance in a preliminary evaluation
conducted on three distinct datasets, i.e., the MIDOG 2025 Atypical Training
Set, the Ami-Br dataset, as well as the preliminary test set of the MIDOG25

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FW-GAN是一个基于频率感知的单样本手写合成框架，通过Wave-MLP和频率引导鉴别器生成高质量、风格一致的手写文本，有效解决手写数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手写合成方法存在两个主要局限：传统卷积架构难以建模长距离依赖和复杂笔画模式，且忽视了频率信息对捕捉细粒度风格细节的关键作用。

Method: 提出FW-GAN框架，包含相位感知Wave-MLP生成器来捕捉空间关系并保留风格线索，频率引导鉴别器利用高频成分增强真实性检测，以及新颖的频率分布损失函数对齐合成与真实手写的频率特征。

Result: 在越南语和英语手写数据集上的实验表明，FW-GAN能生成高质量、风格一致的手写文本，有效提升低资源手写识别系统的数据增强效果。

Conclusion: FW-GAN通过频率感知方法显著提升了手写合成的真实性和风格一致性，为低资源手写识别提供了有价值的数据增强工具。

Abstract: Labeled handwriting data is often scarce, limiting the effectiveness of
recognition systems that require diverse, style-consistent training samples.
Handwriting synthesis offers a promising solution by generating artificial data
to augment training. However, current methods face two major limitations.
First, most are built on conventional convolutional architectures, which
struggle to model long-range dependencies and complex stroke patterns. Second,
they largely ignore the crucial role of frequency information, which is
essential for capturing fine-grained stylistic and structural details in
handwriting. To address these challenges, we propose FW-GAN, a one-shot
handwriting synthesis framework that generates realistic, writer-consistent
text from a single example. Our generator integrates a phase-aware Wave-MLP to
better capture spatial relationships while preserving subtle stylistic cues. We
further introduce a frequency-guided discriminator that leverages
high-frequency components to enhance the authenticity detection of generated
samples. Additionally, we introduce a novel Frequency Distribution Loss that
aligns the frequency characteristics of synthetic and real handwriting, thereby
enhancing visual fidelity. Experiments on Vietnamese and English handwriting
datasets demonstrate that FW-GAN generates high-quality, style-consistent
handwriting, making it a valuable tool for augmenting data in low-resource
handwriting recognition (HTR) pipelines. Official implementation is available

TL;DR: MMG-Vid是一个无需训练的视频token剪枝框架，通过最大化边际增益在段级和token级去除冗余，在保持99.5%性能的同时减少75%视觉token，加速预填充阶段3.9倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频大语言模型的视觉token过多导致计算效率低下，现有方法未考虑视频帧的动态特性和时间依赖性

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1)基于帧相似性分割视频并动态分配token预算；2)使用时序引导的DPC算法联合建模帧间独特性和帧内多样性

Result: 在LLaVA-OneVision-7B上保持99.5%原始性能，减少75%视觉token，预填充阶段加速3.9倍

Conclusion: MMG-Vid能最大化有限token预算的利用率，显著提高效率同时保持强性能

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) excel in video understanding, but their
excessive visual tokens pose a significant computational challenge for
real-world applications. Current methods aim to enhance inference efficiency by
visual token pruning. However, they do not consider the dynamic characteristics
and temporal dependencies of video frames, as they perceive video understanding
as a multi-frame task. To address these challenges, we propose MMG-Vid, a novel
training-free visual token pruning framework that removes redundancy by
Maximizing Marginal Gains at both segment-level and token-level. Specifically,
we first divide the video into segments based on frame similarity, and then
dynamically allocate the token budget for each segment to maximize the marginal
gain of each segment. Subsequently, we propose a temporal-guided DPC algorithm
that jointly models inter-frame uniqueness and intra-frame diversity, thereby
maximizing the marginal gain of each token. By combining both stages, MMG-Vid
can maximize the utilization of the limited token budget, significantly
improving efficiency while maintaining strong performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MMG-Vid can maintain over 99.5% of the original
performance, while effectively reducing 75% visual tokens and accelerating the
prefilling stage by 3.9x on LLaVA-OneVision-7B. Code will be released soon.

Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言-动作模型需要大量后训练，计算开销大，限制了可扩展性和部署。受人类多模态协调启发，需要开发更高效的框架。

Method: 采用3阶段渐进架构：1) EFA-Routing在视觉编码器中注入指令信息选择性聚合视觉token；2) LFP-Routing在语言模型中引入动作意图并剪枝无关token；3) V-L-A耦合注意力机制结合因果视觉-语言注意力和双向动作并行解码。

Conclusion: CogVLA通过认知对齐设计实现了效率与性能的双重提升，为视觉-语言-动作模型的高效部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built on pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) require extensive post-training, resulting in
high computational overhead that limits scalability and deployment.We propose
CogVLA, a Cognition-Aligned Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages
instruction-driven routing and sparsification to improve both efficiency and
performance. CogVLA draws inspiration from human multimodal coordination and
introduces a 3-stage progressive architecture. 1) Encoder-FiLM based
Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instruction information into the
vision encoder to selectively aggregate and compress dual-stream visual tokens,
forming a instruction-aware latent representation. 2) Building upon this
compact visual encoding, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing)
introduces action intent into the language model by pruning
instruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens, thereby achieving token-level
sparsity. 3) To ensure that compressed perception inputs can still support
accurate and coherent action generation, we introduce V-L-A Coupled Attention
(CAtten), which combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional
action parallel decoding. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and
real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art
performance with success rates of 97.4% and 70.0%, respectively, while reducing
training costs by 2.5-fold and decreasing inference latency by 2.8-fold
compared to OpenVLA. CogVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at

Motivation: 现有学术基准与工业实践存在严重差异，训练源同质化且测试图像质量低，阻碍了深度伪造检测器的实际部署。

Method: 1) 构建HydraFake数据集，包含多样化深度伪造技术和野外伪造内容；2) 提出Veritas多模态大语言模型检测器，采用模式感知推理（规划和自我反思）模拟人类取证过程；3) 设计两阶段训练流程。

Result: 实验显示先前检测器在跨模型场景中泛化良好，但在未见伪造技术和数据域上表现不足。Veritas在不同OOD场景中取得显著增益，能够提供透明可信的检测输出。

Conclusion: HydraFake数据集和Veritas检测器有效解决了真实世界深度伪造检测的挑战，通过分层泛化测试和模式感知推理方法提升了检测性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a formidable challenge due to the complex and
evolving nature of fake content in real-world scenarios. However, existing
academic benchmarks suffer from severe discrepancies from industrial practice,
typically featuring homogeneous training sources and low-quality testing
images, which hinder the practical deployments of current detectors. To
mitigate this gap, we introduce HydraFake, a dataset that simulates real-world
challenges with hierarchical generalization testing. Specifically, HydraFake
involves diversified deepfake techniques and in-the-wild forgeries, along with
rigorous training and evaluation protocol, covering unseen model architectures,
emerging forgery techniques and novel data domains. Building on this resource,
we propose Veritas, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) based deepfake
detector. Different from vanilla chain-of-thought (CoT), we introduce
pattern-aware reasoning that involves critical reasoning patterns such as
"planning" and "self-reflection" to emulate human forensic process. We further
propose a two-stage training pipeline to seamlessly internalize such deepfake
reasoning capacities into current MLLMs. Experiments on HydraFake dataset
reveal that although previous detectors show great generalization on
cross-model scenarios, they fall short on unseen forgeries and data domains.
Our Veritas achieves significant gains across different OOD scenarios, and is
capable of delivering transparent and faithful detection outputs.

Motivation: 当前深度伪造检测主要针对完全合成的视频，但局部细微修改的伪造内容更具欺骗性且难以检测，现有检测方法对此存在严重漏洞。

Method: 提出了FakeParts局部深度伪造技术，创建了包含2.5万+视频的FakePartsBench数据集，提供像素级和帧级标注，用于全面评估检测方法。

Result: 用户研究表明，FakeParts使人类检测准确率下降30%以上，现有最先进检测模型也出现类似性能下降，揭示了当前检测方法的严重漏洞。

Conclusion: 这项工作识别了当前深度伪造检测方法的紧急漏洞，为开发更鲁棒的局部视频篡改检测方法提供了必要资源。

Abstract: We introduce FakeParts, a new class of deepfakes characterized by subtle,
localized manipulations to specific spatial regions or temporal segments of
otherwise authentic videos. Unlike fully synthetic content, these partial
manipulations, ranging from altered facial expressions to object substitutions
and background modifications, blend seamlessly with real elements, making them
particularly deceptive and difficult to detect. To address the critical gap in
detection capabilities, we present FakePartsBench, the first large-scale
benchmark dataset specifically designed to capture the full spectrum of partial
deepfakes. Comprising over 25K videos with pixel-level and frame-level
manipulation annotations, our dataset enables comprehensive evaluation of
detection methods. Our user studies demonstrate that FakeParts reduces human
detection accuracy by over 30% compared to traditional deepfakes, with similar
performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art detection models. This
work identifies an urgent vulnerability in current deepfake detection
approaches and provides the necessary resources to develop more robust methods
for partial video manipulations.

Motivation: 现有的单目跟踪器存在深度歧义和遮挡问题，而传统多相机方法需要20台以上摄像机且需要耗时的每序列优化，需要一种更实用的多视角3D跟踪方案

Method: 使用已知摄像机姿态和多视角深度信息，将多视角特征融合成统一点云，采用k近邻相关和基于transformer的更新机制来估计长程3D对应关系，甚至在遮挡情况下也能精确跟踪

Result: 在Panoptic Studio和DexYCB两个真实数据集上评测，中位轨迹误差分别为3.1厘米和2.0厘米，能够良好地渐迁到1-8个视角的不同摄像机配置和24-150帧的视频长度

Abstract: We introduce the first data-driven multi-view 3D point tracker, designed to
track arbitrary points in dynamic scenes using multiple camera views. Unlike
existing monocular trackers, which struggle with depth ambiguities and
occlusion, or prior multi-camera methods that require over 20 cameras and
tedious per-sequence optimization, our feed-forward model directly predicts 3D
correspondences using a practical number of cameras (e.g., four), enabling
robust and accurate online tracking. Given known camera poses and either
sensor-based or estimated multi-view depth, our tracker fuses multi-view
features into a unified point cloud and applies k-nearest-neighbors correlation
alongside a transformer-based update to reliably estimate long-range 3D
correspondences, even under occlusion. We train on 5K synthetic multi-view
Kubric sequences and evaluate on two real-world benchmarks: Panoptic Studio and
DexYCB, achieving median trajectory errors of 3.1 cm and 2.0 cm, respectively.
Our method generalizes well to diverse camera setups of 1-8 views with varying
vantage points and video lengths of 24-150 frames. By releasing our tracker
alongside training and evaluation datasets, we aim to set a new standard for
multi-view 3D tracking research and provide a practical tool for real-world
applications. Project page available at https://ethz-vlg.github.io/mvtracker.

Conclusion: OneReward框架证明了使用单一奖励模型可以有效提升多任务生成能力，无需任务特定的监督微调，在掩码引导图像生成等任务中表现出色。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OneReward, a unified reinforcement learning
framework that enhances the model's generative capabilities across multiple
tasks under different evaluation criteria using only \textit{One Reward} model.
By employing a single vision-language model (VLM) as the generative reward
model, which can distinguish the winner and loser for a given task and a given
evaluation criterion, it can be effectively applied to multi-task generation
models, particularly in contexts with varied data and diverse task objectives.
We utilize OneReward for mask-guided image generation, which can be further
divided into several sub-tasks such as image fill, image extend, object
removal, and text rendering, involving a binary mask as the edit area. Although
these domain-specific tasks share same conditioning paradigm, they differ
significantly in underlying data distributions and evaluation metrics. Existing
methods often rely on task-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which limits
generalization and training efficiency. Building on OneReward, we develop
Seedream 3.0 Fill, a mask-guided generation model trained via multi-task
reinforcement learning directly on a pre-trained base model, eliminating the
need for task-specific SFT. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified
edit model consistently outperforms both commercial and open-source
competitors, such as Ideogram, Adobe Photoshop, and FLUX Fill [Pro], across
multiple evaluation dimensions. Code and model are available at:

Motivation: 现有数字水印技术在对抗攻击下的鲁棒性不明确，需要通过挑战赛来测试水印在对抗攻击下的生存能力

Method: 灰盒跟踪使用自适应VAE规避攻击，结合测试时优化和CIELAB色彩空间对比度恢复；黑盒跟踪通过空间/频域伪影聚类，应用扩散模型和ChatGPT生成的语义先验进行受控噪声注入

Result: 方法成功实现了95.7%的近完美水印移除率，对剩余图像质量影响可忽略不计

Conclusion: 这些攻击方法有望推动更鲁棒的图像水印技术的发展

Abstract: Content watermarking is an important tool for the authentication and
copyright protection of digital media. However, it is unclear whether existing
watermarks are robust against adversarial attacks. We present the winning
solution to the NeurIPS 2024 Erasing the Invisible challenge, which
stress-tests watermark robustness under varying degrees of adversary knowledge.
The challenge consisted of two tracks: a black-box and beige-box track,
depending on whether the adversary knows which watermarking method was used by
the provider. For the beige-box track, we leverage an adaptive VAE-based
evasion attack, with a test-time optimization and color-contrast restoration in
CIELAB space to preserve the image's quality. For the black-box track, we first
cluster images based on their artifacts in the spatial or frequency-domain.
Then, we apply image-to-image diffusion models with controlled noise injection
and semantic priors from ChatGPT-generated captions to each cluster with
optimized parameter settings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method
successfully achieves near-perfect watermark removal (95.7%) with negligible
impact on the residual image's quality. We hope that our attacks inspire the
development of more robust image watermarking methods.
