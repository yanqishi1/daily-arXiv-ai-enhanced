### [1] [Shoot First, Ask Questions Later? Building Rational Agents that Explore and Act Like People](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20886)
*Gabriel Grand,Valerio Pepe,Jacob Andreas,Joshua B. Tenenbaum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文开发了基于贝叶斯实验设计的蒙特卡洛推理策略，显著提升了语言模型在战略决策对话任务中的理性信息寻求能力，使较弱模型在协作战舰游戏中击败人类和前沿模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多高风险AI应用需要形成数据驱动的假设并进行有针对性的猜测，但在有限资源下，基于语言模型的代理是否能理性行动仍存在问题。

Method: 引入协作战舰战略对话任务，开发基于贝叶斯实验设计的蒙特卡洛推理策略，用于提升观察员代理的准确性和船长代理的信息增益。

Result: 观察员代理准确率提升14.7%，船长代理信息增益提升0.227比特（达到噪声上限的94.2%），较弱模型Llama-4-Scout在协作战舰中击败人类（胜率从8%升至82%）和GPT-5（胜率从0%升至67%），成本仅为GPT-5的1%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了语言模型代理的理性信息寻求能力，在多个任务中表现出通用适用性，为构建理性信息寻求代理提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Many high-stakes applications of AI require forming data-driven hypotheses
and making targeted guesses; e.g., in scientific and diagnostic settings. Given
limited resources, to what extent do agents based on language models (LMs) act
rationally? We develop methods to benchmark and enhance agentic
information-seeking, drawing on insights from human behavior. First, we
introduce a strategic decision-oriented dialogue task called Collaborative
Battleship, in which a partially-informed Captain must balance exploration
(asking questions) and action (taking shots), while a fully-informed Spotter
must provide accurate answers under an information bottleneck. Compared to
human players (N=42), we find that LM agents struggle to ground answers in
context, generate informative questions, and select high-value actions. Next,
to address these gaps, we develop novel Monte Carlo inference strategies for
LMs based on principles from Bayesian Experimental Design (BED). For Spotter
agents, our approach boosts accuracy by up to 14.7% absolute over LM-only
baselines; for Captain agents, it raises expected information gain (EIG) by up
to 0.227 bits (94.2% of the achievable noise ceiling). Combined, these
components yield sharper targeting (+0.303-0.374 F1), and enable weaker LMs,
such as Llama-4-Scout, to outperform both humans (8% -> 82% win rate) and
frontier models (0% -> 67% win rate vs. GPT-5) at ~1% of GPT-5's cost. We
replicate these findings on Guess Who? where our methods significantly boost
accuracy (+28.3-42.4 p.p.), demonstrating their general applicability for
building rational information-seeking agents.

### [2] [Code-enabled language models can outperform reasoning models on diverse tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20909)
*Cedegao E. Zhang,Cédric Colas,Gabriel Poesia,Joshua B. Tenenbaum,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CodeAdapt方法通过结合CodeAct框架和少样本上下文学习，让标准指令微调语言模型无需额外训练就能达到或超越专门推理模型的性能，同时显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理模型需要大量计算资源和数据训练，运行成本高昂且效率较低。研究发现标准指令微调语言模型本身就具备强大的推理能力，只需适当引导即可发挥。

Method: 提出CodeAdapt方法：结合CodeAct框架（语言模型在自然语言推理中穿插代码执行）和少样本引导式上下文学习，仅需5个训练问题即可激发模型的推理能力。

Result: 在四个模型对和八个任务上的测试显示，CodeAdapt让三个语言模型平均性能超越对应推理模型（最高提升22.9%），同时token效率提升10-81%；在六个任务上四个模型平均性能显著提升（最高35.7%）。

Conclusion: CodeAdapt式学习推理具有鲁棒性和领域通用性，代码增强的语言模型是认知基础扎实的强大系统，为权重内强化学习提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Reasoning models (RMs), language models (LMs) trained with reinforcement
learning to produce long-form natural language reasoning, have been remarkably
successful, but they still require large amounts of computation and data to
train, and can be slow and expensive to run. In this paper, we show that
standard instruct LMs can already be elicited to be strong reasoners at a level
comparable to or even surpassing their corresponding RMs (e.g., DeepSeek V3 vs
R1) without finetuning, across diverse domains from instruction following and
creative generation to mathematical reasoning. This is achieved by CodeAdapt,
our simple recipe that combines the CodeAct framework, where LMs interleave
natural language reasoning with code execution in a multi-step fashion, with
few-shot bootstrap in-context learning from as few as five training problems.
Analyzing four matched pairs of LMs and RMs, we find that CodeAdapt enables
three LMs to outperform the corresponding RMs on average over eight tasks (up
to 22.9%) while being 10-81% more token efficient, and delivers superior
performance on six tasks when averaged over the four models (up to 35.7%).
Furthermore, the code-augmented reasoning traces display rich and varied
problem-solving strategies. Our findings support that (1) CodeAdapt-style
learning and reasoning may be robust and domain general and (2) code-enabled
LMs are cognitively grounded and powerful systems, potentially providing a
strong foundation for in-weight reinforcement learning.

### [3] [FicSim: A Dataset for Multi-Faceted Semantic Similarity in Long-Form Fiction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20926)
*Natasha Johnson,Amanda Bertsch,Maria-Emil Deal,Emma Strubell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FICSIM是一个用于评估语言模型在计算文学研究中应用的长篇小说相似性数据集，包含12个维度的相似性评分，由作者提供的元数据和数字人文学者验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于长文本细粒度标注成本高和公共领域文学数据污染问题，当前嵌入相似性数据集不适合评估文学领域任务，需要专门的长篇小说相似性数据集。

Method: 收集最近创作的长篇小说，基于作者提供的元数据构建12个维度的相似性评分，并由数字人文学者验证，优先考虑作者自主权和持续知情同意。

Result: 评估多个嵌入模型发现，这些模型倾向于关注表面特征而非对计算文学研究有用的语义类别。

Conclusion: FICSIM数据集填补了文学领域评估的空白，揭示了当前嵌入模型在文学分析中的局限性，强调了作者参与的重要性。

Abstract: As language models become capable of processing increasingly long and complex
texts, there has been growing interest in their application within
computational literary studies. However, evaluating the usefulness of these
models for such tasks remains challenging due to the cost of fine-grained
annotation for long-form texts and the data contamination concerns inherent in
using public-domain literature. Current embedding similarity datasets are not
suitable for evaluating literary-domain tasks because of a focus on
coarse-grained similarity and primarily on very short text. We assemble and
release FICSIM, a dataset of long-form, recently written fiction, including
scores along 12 axes of similarity informed by author-produced metadata and
validated by digital humanities scholars. We evaluate a suite of embedding
models on this task, demonstrating a tendency across models to focus on
surface-level features over semantic categories that would be useful for
computational literary studies tasks. Throughout our data-collection process,
we prioritize author agency and rely on continual, informed author consent.

### [4] [Do LLMs Truly Understand When a Precedent Is Overruled?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20941)
*Li Zhang,Jaromir Savelka,Kevin Ashley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估大语言模型在识别美国最高法院案例中的推翻关系方面的表现，发现存在时代敏感性、浅层推理和上下文依赖的推理失败等关键限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够捕捉现实、高风险任务的长上下文基准，因为现有评估大多依赖简化的合成任务，无法代表真实世界文档理解的复杂性。推翻关系是普通法原则的基础，为长文档法律理解提供了重要测试平台。

Method: 使用236对案例数据集，评估最先进的大语言模型在识别美国最高法院案例中推翻关系的能力。

Result: 评估揭示了三个关键限制：1) 时代敏感性——模型对历史案例表现下降，显示训练中存在基本时间偏见；2) 浅层推理——模型依赖浅层逻辑启发式而非深度法律理解；3) 上下文依赖的推理失败——在复杂开放任务中产生时间上不可能的关系，尽管在简单上下文中保持基本时间意识。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了一个基准，解决了现实长上下文评估中的关键差距，提供了一个反映实际法律推理任务复杂性和重要性的环境。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows show promise for
complex legal reasoning tasks, yet their ability to understand long legal
documents remains insufficiently evaluated. Developing long-context benchmarks
that capture realistic, high-stakes tasks remains a significant challenge in
the field, as most existing evaluations rely on simplified synthetic tasks that
fail to represent the complexity of real-world document understanding.
Overruling relationships are foundational to common-law doctrine and commonly
found in judicial opinions. They provide a focused and important testbed for
long-document legal understanding that closely resembles what legal
professionals actually do. We present an assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs on
identifying overruling relationships from U.S. Supreme Court cases using a
dataset of 236 case pairs. Our evaluation reveals three critical limitations:
(1) era sensitivity -- the models show degraded performance on historical cases
compared to modern ones, revealing fundamental temporal bias in their training;
(2) shallow reasoning -- models rely on shallow logical heuristics rather than
deep legal comprehension; and (3) context-dependent reasoning failures --
models produce temporally impossible relationships in complex open-ended tasks
despite maintaining basic temporal awareness in simple contexts. Our work
contributes a benchmark that addresses the critical gap in realistic
long-context evaluation, providing an environment that mirrors the complexity
and stakes of actual legal reasoning tasks.

### [5] [Irish-BLiMP: A Linguistic Benchmark for Evaluating Human and Language Model Performance in a Low-Resource Setting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20957)
*Josh McGiff,Khanh-Tung Tran,William Mulcahy,Dáibhidh Ó Luinín,Jake Dalzell,Róisín Ní Bhroin,Adam Burke,Barry O'Sullivan,Hoang D. Nguyen,Nikola S. Nikolov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 爱尔兰-BLiMP是首个针对爱尔兰语的语言能力评估数据集和框架，包含1020个最小对，评估显示人类在所有语言特征上都优于所有模型，准确率平均高出16.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为濒危语言爱尔兰语创建首个系统性的语言能力评估框架，填补低资源语言在大型语言模型评估方面的空白。

Method: 基于语言学文献和语法参考书，由流利的爱尔兰语使用者团队手动构建和审查1020个最小对，涵盖11个语言特征分类。

Result: 人类参与者准确率达90.1%，表现优于所有模型；开源和闭源LLM之间存在18.1%的性能差距；最强的GPT-5模型仅达到73.5%准确率。

Conclusion: 爱尔兰-BLiMP为评估LLM在爱尔兰语中的语法能力提供了首个系统性框架，并为低资源语言的语言理解研究提供了有价值的基准。

Abstract: We present Irish-BLiMP (Irish Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal Pairs), the
first dataset and framework designed for fine-grained evaluation of linguistic
competence in the Irish language, an endangered language. Drawing on a variety
of linguistic literature and grammar reference works, we manually constructed
and reviewed 1020 minimal pairs across a taxonomy of 11 linguistic features,
through a team of fluent Irish speakers. We evaluate both existing Large
Language Models (LLMs) and fluent human participants on their syntactic
knowledge of Irish. Our findings show that humans outperform all models across
all linguistic features, achieving 16.6% higher accuracy on average. Moreover,
a substantial performance gap of 18.1% persists between open- and closed-source
LLMs, with even the strongest model (gpt-5) reaching only 73.5% accuracy
compared to 90.1% by human. Interestingly, human participants and models
struggle on different aspects of Irish grammar, thus highlighting a difference
in representation learned by the models. Overall, Irish-BLiMP provides the
first systematic framework for evaluating the grammatical competence of LLMs in
Irish and offers a valuable benchmark for advancing research on linguistic
understanding in low-resource languages.

### [6] [Can Confidence Estimates Decide When Chain-of-thought is Necessary for Llms?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21007)
*Samuel Lewis-Lim,Xingwei Tan,Zhixue Zhao,Nikolaos Aletras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了置信度门控的思维链方法，让模型仅在直接回答置信度低时才进行推理，以减少不必要的token使用。通过系统评估四种无需训练的置信度估计方法，发现它们能减少冗余推理，但效果因数据集和模型而异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 思维链提示虽然能提升复杂任务的准确性，但经常不必要地增加token使用，限制了推理模型的实际应用。现有模型允许调整思维链长度，但何时使用思维链仍不明确。

Method: 提出了置信度门控思维链方法，评估了四种无需训练的置信度估计方法，并与随机基线和知道何时需要思维链的oracle进行比较。

Result: 现有无需训练的置信度度量能减少冗余思维链，优于随机调用思维链。但单个置信度度量的效用不一致，随数据集和模型变化。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前置信度门控思维链方法的潜力和局限性，为开发更可靠的自适应思维链门控铺平了道路。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a common technique for
enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). While
extended reasoning can boost accuracy on complex tasks, it is often unnecessary
and substantially increases token usage, limiting the practicality of reasoning
models in many scenarios. Recent models, such as GPT-OSS and Qwen3, expose
controls that enable users to adjust the length of CoT or determine whether it
is used at all. Yet, it remains unclear when CoT should be used: on some tasks
it improves performance, while on others it provides little benefit or even
harms performance. We address this challenge with confidence-gated CoT, where a
model invokes reasoning only when confidence in its direct answer is low. To
this end, we present the first systematic study of training-free confidence
estimation methods for CoT gating. Specifically, we evaluate four training-free
confidence estimation methods and compare them to a random baseline and an
oracle that always knows when CoT is needed. Through extensive experiments, we
show that existing training-free confidence measures can reduce redundant CoT
and outperform randomly invoked CoT. However, the utility of individual
confidence measures is inconsistent, varying with both the dataset and the
model, underscoring the difficulty of deploying confidence-gated CoT in
practice. By analysing both strengths and failure modes, our study highlights
the potential and limitations of current methods and paves the way toward more
reliable adaptive gating of CoT.

### [7] [Input Matters: Evaluating Input Structure's Impact on LLM Summaries of Sports Play-by-Play](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21034)
*Barkavi Sundararajan,Somayajulu Sripada,Ehud Reiter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究量化了输入数据结构对LLM生成NBA比赛摘要中幻觉和事实错误的影响，发现JSON格式输入相比非结构化输入能减少约65-69%的错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在体育报道等准确性要求高的领域部署LLM时，生成文本可能无法忠实反映输入数据，需要量化输入结构对幻觉和事实错误的影响。

Method: 使用三种输入格式（行结构、JSON和非结构化）测试两个LLM模型（Llama-3.1-70B和Qwen2.5-72B），手动标注了180场比赛摘要中的3,312个事实错误。

Result: 输入结构对错误率有显著影响：JSON输入相比非结构化输入减少错误率69%（Llama）和65%（Qwen），行结构输入减少54%（Llama）和51%（Qwen）。ANOVA分析显示输入结构解释了80%以上的错误率方差。

Conclusion: 结构化输入格式（特别是JSON）能显著减少LLM生成体育报道中的事实错误，在准确性要求高的应用中应优先使用结构化数据格式。

Abstract: A major concern when deploying LLMs in accuracy-critical domains such as
sports reporting is that the generated text may not faithfully reflect the
input data. We quantify how input structure affects hallucinations and other
factual errors in LLM-generated summaries of NBA play-by-play data, across
three formats: row-structured, JSON and unstructured. We manually annotated
3,312 factual errors across 180 game summaries produced by two models,
Llama-3.1-70B and Qwen2.5-72B. Input structure has a strong effect: JSON input
reduces error rates by 69% for Llama and 65% for Qwen compared to unstructured
input, while row-structured input reduces errors by 54% for Llama and 51% for
Qwen. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA shows that input structure accounts for
over 80% of the variance in error rates, with Tukey HSD post hoc tests
confirming statistically significant differences between all input formats.

### [8] [Reasoning's Razor: Reasoning Improves Accuracy but Can Hurt Recall at Critical Operating Points in Safety and Hallucination Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21049)
*Atoosa Chegini,Hamid Kazemi,Garrett Souza,Maria Safi,Yang Song,Samy Bengio,Sinead Williamson,Mehrdad Farajtabar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 推理增强的LLMs在低误报率场景下表现不佳，传统无推理模式在精度敏感任务中更优，简单的两模式集成可结合各自优势


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究推理在精度敏感分类任务中的适用性，特别是在低误报率(FPR)场景下的表现

Method: 系统研究推理在安全检测和幻觉检测任务中的表现，比较推理增强(Think On)和无推理(Think Off)模式，评估基于token的评分与自述置信度

Result: 推理增强模式提高整体准确率但在低FPR阈值下表现较差，无推理模式在精度敏感场景中占优，两模式集成可恢复各自优势

Conclusion: 推理是双刃剑：有益于平均准确率，但不适合需要严格精度的应用场景

Abstract: Reasoning has become a central paradigm for large language models (LLMs),
consistently boosting accuracy across diverse benchmarks. Yet its suitability
for precision-sensitive tasks remains unclear. We present the first systematic
study of reasoning for classification tasks under strict low false positive
rate (FPR) regimes. Our analysis covers two tasks--safety detection and
hallucination detection--evaluated in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings,
using standard LLMs and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). Our results reveal a
clear trade-off: Think On (reasoning-augmented) generation improves overall
accuracy, but underperforms at the low-FPR thresholds essential for practical
use. In contrast, Think Off (no reasoning during inference) dominates in these
precision-sensitive regimes, with Think On surpassing only when higher FPRs are
acceptable. In addition, we find token-based scoring substantially outperforms
self-verbalized confidence for precision-sensitive deployments. Finally, a
simple ensemble of the two modes recovers the strengths of each. Taken
together, our findings position reasoning as a double-edged tool: beneficial
for average accuracy, but often ill-suited for applications requiring strict
precision.

### [9] [Dynamic Retriever for In-Context Knowledge Editing via Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21059)
*Mahmud Wasif Nafee,Maiqi Jiang,Haipeng Chen,Yanfu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DR-IKE是一个轻量级框架，通过动态选择编辑效用高的演示样本，解决了传统上下文知识编辑中的数量-质量权衡和任务难度适应性问题，在保持黑盒LLM兼容性的同时显著提升了编辑效果和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于上下文的知识编辑方法依赖静态演示集，存在数量-质量权衡问题和缺乏对任务难度的适应性，需要更智能的演示选择机制。

Method: 使用BERT检索器通过REINFORCE算法按编辑奖励对演示样本进行排序，并采用可学习阈值修剪低价值样本，根据任务难度动态调整提示长度。

Result: 在COUNTERFACT基准测试中，编辑成功率提升高达17.1%，延迟降低41.6%，同时保持对不相关查询的准确性。

Conclusion: DR-IKE展示了无需修改模型权重的可扩展和自适应知识编辑方法，为黑盒LLM的知识更新提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at factual recall yet still propagate
stale or incorrect knowledge. In-context knowledge editing offers a
gradient-free remedy suitable for black-box APIs, but current editors rely on
static demonstration sets chosen by surface-level similarity, leading to two
persistent obstacles: (i) a quantity-quality trade-off, and (ii) lack of
adaptivity to task difficulty. We address these issues by dynamically selecting
supporting demonstrations according to their utility for the edit. We propose
Dynamic Retriever for In-Context Knowledge Editing (DR-IKE), a lightweight
framework that (1) trains a BERT retriever with REINFORCE to rank
demonstrations by editing reward, and (2) employs a learnable threshold to
prune low-value examples, shortening the prompt when the edit is easy and
expanding it when the task is hard. DR-IKE performs editing without modifying
model weights, relying solely on forward passes for compatibility with
black-box LLMs. On the COUNTERFACT benchmark, it improves edit success by up to
17.1%, reduces latency by 41.6%, and preserves accuracy on unrelated queries,
demonstrating scalable and adaptive knowledge editing. The code is available at

### [10] [Bridging Language Gaps with Adaptive RAG: Improving Indonesian Language Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21068)
*William Christian,Daniel Adamlu,Adrian Yu,Derwin Suhartono*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究将自适应RAG系统应用于印尼语问答任务，通过问题复杂度分类和机器翻译数据增强来克服低资源语言的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的问答系统主要针对英语，存在语言差距问题。本研究旨在通过自适应RAG系统弥合这一差距，为印尼语开发问答系统。

Method: 采用自适应RAG系统，集成问题复杂度分类器来决定回答策略；使用机器翻译进行数据增强以解决印尼语数据集有限的问题。

Result: 问题复杂度分类器表现可靠，但多检索回答策略存在显著不一致性，对整体评估产生负面影响。

Conclusion: 研究展示了低资源语言问答的潜力和挑战，为未来改进指明了方向。

Abstract: Question Answering (QA) has seen significant improvements with the
advancement of machine learning models, further studies enhanced this question
answering system by retrieving external information, called Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) to produce more accurate and informative answers. However,
these state-of-the-art-performance is predominantly in English language. To
address this gap we made an effort of bridging language gaps by incorporating
Adaptive RAG system to Indonesian language. Adaptive RAG system integrates a
classifier whose task is to distinguish the question complexity, which in turn
determines the strategy for answering the question. To overcome the limited
availability of Indonesian language dataset, our study employs machine
translation as data augmentation approach. Experiments show reliable question
complexity classifier; however, we observed significant inconsistencies in
multi-retrieval answering strategy which negatively impacted the overall
evaluation when this strategy was applied. These findings highlight both the
promise and challenges of question answering in low-resource language
suggesting directions for future improvement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个公开的中文药物推荐数据集CDrugRed，包含5,894条代谢疾病出院用药记录，并评估了多种大语言模型在该任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前药物推荐系统的发展受到公开真实世界电子健康记录数据集稀缺的阻碍，特别是非英语语言的数据集。

Method: 构建了包含5,894条去标识化记录的中文药物推荐数据集，涵盖患者人口统计学、病史、临床过程和出院诊断等信息，并基于该数据集对多种大语言模型进行基准测试。

Result: 监督微调能提升模型性能，但仍有很大改进空间，最佳模型的F1分数为0.5648，Jaccard分数为0.4477。

Conclusion: 临床药物推荐任务具有复杂性，CDrugRed数据集为开发更鲁棒和准确的药物推荐系统提供了具有挑战性的宝贵资源。

Abstract: Intelligent drug recommendation based on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is
critical for improving for improving the quality and efficiency of clinical
decision-making. By leveraging large-scale patient data, drug recommendation
systems can assist physicians in selecting the most appropriate medications
according to a patient's medical history, diagnoses, laboratory results, and
comorbidities. However, the advancement of such systems is significantly
hampered by the scarcity of publicly available, real-world EHR datasets,
particularly in languages other than English. In this work, we present
CDrugRed, a first publicly available Chinese drug recommendation dataset
focused on discharge medications for metabolic diseases. The dataset includes
5,894 de-identified records from 3,190 patients, containing comprehensive
information such as patient demographics, medical history, clinical course, and
discharge diagnoses. We assess the utility of CDrugRed by benchmarking several
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on the discharge medication
recommendation task. Experimental results show that while supervised
fine-tuning improves model performance, there remains substantial room for
improvement, with the best model achieving the F1 score of 0.5648 and Jaccard
score of 0.4477. This result highlights the complexity of the clinical drug
recommendation task and establishes CDrugRed as a challenging and valuable
resource for developing more robust and accurate drug recommendation systems.
The dataset is publicly available to the research community under the data
usage agreements at https://github.com/DUTIR-BioNLP/CDrugRed.

### [12] [Self-Rewarding PPO: Aligning Large Language Models with Demonstrations Only](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21090)
*Qingru Zhang,Liang Qiu,Ilgee Hong,Zhenghao Xu,Tianyi Liu,Shiyang Li,Rongzhi Zhang,Zheng Li,Lihong Li,Bing Yin,Chao Zhang,Jianshu Chen,Haoming Jiang,Tuo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Self-Rewarding PPO方法，结合SFT和PPO的优势，通过自奖励机制实现无需人工标注的在线策略微调，提升大语言模型的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督微调(SFT)存在过拟合和域外泛化能力差的问题，特别是在数据有限的情况下。需要一种更有效的方法来提升大语言模型的对齐效果。

Method: 结合SFT和近端策略优化(PPO)，设计基于SFT模型与预训练基础模型对数策略比率的奖励函数，实现自奖励的在线策略微调。

Result: 在多个自然语言处理任务上的实证评估表明，Self-Rewarding PPO持续优于传统SFT方法，特别是在高质量标注数据稀缺的情况下。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了SFT的局限性，提高了泛化能力、数据效率和鲁棒性，为使用演示数据对齐大语言模型提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has emerged as a crucial method for aligning
large language models (LLMs) with human-annotated demonstrations. However, SFT,
being an off-policy approach similar to behavior cloning, often struggles with
overfitting and poor out-of-domain generalization, especially in limited-data
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Rewarding PPO, a novel
fine-tuning method that leverages on-policy techniques to enhance
generalization performance. Our approach combines the strengths of SFT and
proximal policy optimization (PPO) to achieve more effective alignment from
demonstration data. At its core is a reward function designed as the log policy
ratio between the SFT model and the pretrained base model. This function serves
as an implicit reward signal, using the pretrained policy as a baseline and the
SFT policy as a target. By doing so, it enables on-policy fine-tuning without
relying on human preference annotations. The integration of this self-rewarding
mechanism with PPO addresses key limitations of SFT, improving generalization,
data efficiency, and robustness. Our empirical evaluation across a range of
natural language processing tasks demonstrates that Self-Rewarding PPO
consistently outperforms traditional SFT methods. The results highlight the
effectiveness of our approach in aligning LLMs using demonstration data,
particularly in scenarios where high-quality annotated data is scarce.

### [13] [The Gray Zone of Faithfulness: Taming Ambiguity in Unfaithfulness Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21118)
*Qiang Ding,Lvzhou Luo,Yixuan Cao,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了VeriGray基准，通过引入Out-Dependent类别来解决摘要忠实度检测中的标注模糊问题，发现即使最先进的LLM在摘要任务中仍存在约6%的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有忠实度检测基准存在标注模糊问题，主要由于生成输出中允许使用外部知识的边界不明确，导致标注不一致。

Method: 提出新的忠实度标注框架，引入中间类别Out-Dependent来分类需要外部知识验证的情况，并构建了VeriGray基准。

Result: 统计显示SOTA LLM在摘要任务中存在约6%的幻觉，约8%的生成句子属于Out-Dependent类别，基准对多种基线方法构成显著挑战。

Conclusion: 解决标注模糊对于忠实度检测基准至关重要，当前方法仍有很大改进空间。

Abstract: Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) generate summaries faithful to a
given source document is essential for real-world applications. While prior
research has explored LLM faithfulness, existing benchmarks suffer from
annotation ambiguity, primarily due to the ill-defined boundary of permissible
external knowledge in generated outputs. For instance, common sense is often
incorporated into responses and labeled as "faithful", yet the acceptable
extent of such knowledge remains unspecified, leading to inconsistent
annotations. To address this issue, we propose a novel faithfulness annotation
framework, which introduces an intermediate category, Out-Dependent, to
classify cases where external knowledge is required for verification. Using
this framework, we construct VeriGray (Verification with the Gray Zone) -- a
new unfaithfulness detection benchmark in summarization. Statistics reveal that
even SOTA LLMs, such as GPT-5, exhibit hallucinations ($\sim 6\%$ of sentences)
in summarization tasks. Moreover, a substantial proportion ($\sim 8\%$ on
average of models) of generated sentences fall into the Out-Dependent category,
underscoring the importance of resolving annotation ambiguity in unfaithfulness

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural
language processing through strong semantic understanding and generation.
However, their black-box nature limits structured and multi-hop reasoning. In
contrast, Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) provide explicit relational structures
enriched with textual context, yet often lack semantic depth. Recent research
shows that combining LLMs and TAGs yields complementary benefits: enhancing TAG
representation learning and improving the reasoning and interpretability of
LLMs. This survey provides the first systematic review of LLM--TAG integration
from an orchestration perspective. We introduce a novel taxonomy covering two
fundamental directions: LLM for TAG, where LLMs enrich graph-based tasks, and
TAG for LLM, where structured graphs improve LLM reasoning. We categorize
orchestration strategies into sequential, parallel, and multi-module
frameworks, and discuss advances in TAG-specific pretraining, prompting, and
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Beyond methodology, we summarize empirical
insights, curate available datasets, and highlight diverse applications across
recommendation systems, biomedical analysis, and knowledge-intensive question
answering. Finally, we outline open challenges and promising research
directions, aiming to guide future work at the intersection of language and
graph learning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在模拟人类行为时存在理想化偏差，无法真实再现人类社会的复杂性，而是创造出缺乏多样性的"乌托邦"社会。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLMs在模拟人类行为方面显示出潜力，但它们在社交情境中与真实人类行为的差异程度尚未充分探索，这可能导致科学研究中的误解和实际应用中的意外后果。

Method: 通过聊天室式对话模拟多智能体互动，并在五个语言维度上进行分析，提供了一个简单有效的框架来检验LLMs中出现的社交认知偏差。

Result: 实验发现LLMs不会忠实再现真实人类行为，而是反映过度理想化的版本，表现出社会角色偏差、首因效应和积极性偏差。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁开发更具社会基础性的LLMs，以捕捉人类社交行为的多样性。

Abstract: Reliable simulation of human behavior is essential for explaining,
predicting, and intervening in our society. Recent advances in large language
models (LLMs) have shown promise in emulating human behaviors, interactions,
and decision-making, offering a powerful new lens for social science studies.
However, the extent to which LLMs diverge from authentic human behavior in
social contexts remains underexplored, posing risks of misinterpretation in
scientific studies and unintended consequences in real-world applications.
Here, we introduce a systematic framework for analyzing LLMs' behavior in
social simulation. Our approach simulates multi-agent interactions through
chatroom-style conversations and analyzes them across five linguistic
dimensions, providing a simple yet effective method to examine emergent social
cognitive biases. We conduct extensive experiments involving eight
representative LLMs across three families. Our findings reveal that LLMs do not
faithfully reproduce genuine human behavior but instead reflect overly
idealized versions of it, shaped by the social desirability bias. In
particular, LLMs show social role bias, primacy effect, and positivity bias,
resulting in "Utopian" societies that lack the complexity and variability of
real human interactions. These findings call for more socially grounded LLMs
that capture the diversity of human social behavior.

Motivation: 爱沙尼亚语的LLM基准测试资源有限，缺乏对不同LLM在爱沙尼亚语任务上性能的全面比较。

Method: 基于7个从本地爱沙尼亚语源生成的数据集构建基准测试，评估6个基础模型和26个指令调优模型，结合人工评估和LLM作为评判的方法。

Result: 人工评估分数与基准测试评估呈中等到高度相关，Claude 3.7 Sonnet作为LLM评判与人工评分高度一致。

Conclusion: 高性能LLM可以有效支持爱沙尼亚语模型的评估，为爱沙尼亚语NLP研究提供了重要基准工具。

Abstract: The availability of LLM benchmarks for the Estonian language is limited, and
a comprehensive evaluation comparing the performance of different LLMs on
Estonian tasks has yet to be conducted. We introduce a new benchmark for
evaluating LLMs in Estonian, based on seven diverse datasets. These datasets
assess general and domain-specific knowledge, understanding of Estonian grammar
and vocabulary, summarization abilities, contextual comprehension, and more.
The datasets are all generated from native Estonian sources without using
machine translation. We compare the performance of base models,
instruction-tuned open-source models, and commercial models. Our evaluation
includes 6 base models and 26 instruction-tuned models. To assess the results,
we employ both human evaluation and LLM-as-a-judge methods. Human evaluation
scores showed moderate to high correlation with benchmark evaluations,
depending on the dataset. Claude 3.7 Sonnet, used as an LLM judge, demonstrated
strong alignment with human ratings, indicating that top-performing LLMs can
effectively support the evaluation of Estonian-language models.

Abstract: The rise of right-wing populism in Europe has brought to the forefront the
significance of analysing social media discourse to understand the
dissemination of extremist ideologies and their impact on political outcomes.
Twitter, as a platform for interaction and mobilisation, provides a unique
window into the everyday communication of far-right supporters. In this paper,
we propose a methodology that uses state-of-the-art natural language processing
techniques with sociological insights to analyse the MIGR-TWIT corpus of
far-right tweets in English and French. We aim to uncover patterns of discourse
surrounding migration, hate speech, and persuasion techniques employed by right
and far-right actors. By integrating linguistic, sociological, and
computational approaches, we seek to offer cross-disciplinary insights into
societal dynamics and contribute to a better understanding of contemporary
challenges posed by right-wing extremism on social media platforms.

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于大型语言模型的多智能体系统，用于模拟紧急医疗调度场景，通过临床分类学和事实共享确保临床合理性，评估显示系统在调度有效性和指导效能方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 紧急医疗调度过程面临呼叫者情绪困扰、信息模糊性和认知负荷等挑战，需要利用大型语言模型和多智能体系统来增强调度员能力。

Method: 构建临床分类学（32种主诉、6种呼叫者身份）和六阶段呼叫协议，开发基于AutoGen的多智能体系统，包含呼叫者和调度员智能体，使用混合评估框架（医师评估+自动语言分析）。

Result: 系统表现出色：调度有效性94%（正确联系其他代理），指导效能91%（提供建议），情感分析显示73.7%中性情感，90.4%中性情绪，高可读性（Flesch 80.9），60%礼貌风格。

Conclusion: 基于分类学的多智能体系统能够高保真地模拟多样化、临床合理的调度场景，可用于调度员培训、协议评估和实时决策支持，为AI安全集成到应急响应工作流程提供了路径。

Abstract: Objective: Emergency medical dispatch (EMD) is a high-stakes process
challenged by caller distress, ambiguity, and cognitive load. Large Language
Models (LLMs) and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) offer opportunities to augment
dispatchers. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a taxonomy-grounded,
LLM-powered multi-agent system for simulating realistic EMD scenarios. Methods:
We constructed a clinical taxonomy (32 chief complaints, 6 caller identities
from MIMIC-III) and a six-phase call protocol. Using this framework, we
developed an AutoGen-based MAS with Caller and Dispatcher Agents. The system
grounds interactions in a fact commons to ensure clinical plausibility and
mitigate misinformation. We used a hybrid evaluation framework: four physicians
assessed 100 simulated cases for "Guidance Efficacy" and "Dispatch
Effectiveness," supplemented by automated linguistic analysis (sentiment,
readability, politeness). Results: Human evaluation, with substantial
inter-rater agreement (Gwe's AC1 > 0.70), confirmed the system's high
performance. It demonstrated excellent Dispatch Effectiveness (e.g., 94 %
contacting the correct potential other agents) and Guidance Efficacy (advice
provided in 91 % of cases), both rated highly by physicians. Algorithmic
metrics corroborated these findings, indicating a predominantly neutral
affective profile (73.7 % neutral sentiment; 90.4 % neutral emotion), high
readability (Flesch 80.9), and a consistently polite style (60.0 % polite; 0 %
impolite). Conclusion: Our taxonomy-grounded MAS simulates diverse, clinically
plausible dispatch scenarios with high fidelity. Findings support its use for
dispatcher training, protocol evaluation, and as a foundation for real-time
decision support. This work outlines a pathway for safely integrating advanced
AI agents into emergency response workflows.

TL;DR: 该论文引入相关维度作为衡量文本认知复杂度的分形几何指标，能够揭示语言模型训练动态、检测幻觉倾向和文本退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估指标强调局部预测准确性而忽略长程结构复杂性，无法解释语言模型即使困惑度低仍会出现重复和不连贯等行为。

Method: 使用相关维度这一分形几何度量来量化语言模型感知的文本认知复杂度，捕捉语言的分层递归结构。

Result: 相关维度能够揭示预训练的三个不同阶段、反映上下文依赖的复杂性、指示模型幻觉倾向，并可靠检测生成文本中的多种退化形式。

Conclusion: 相关维度计算高效、对模型量化鲁棒、适用于多种自回归架构，为理解LLMs的生成动态提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in natural
language generation, yet they continue to display puzzling behaviors -- such as
repetition and incoherence -- even when exhibiting low perplexity. This
highlights a key limitation of conventional evaluation metrics, which emphasize
local prediction accuracy while overlooking long-range structural complexity.
We introduce correlation dimension, a fractal-geometric measure of
self-similarity, to quantify the epistemological complexity of text as
perceived by a language model. This measure captures the hierarchical
recurrence structure of language, bridging local and global properties in a
unified framework. Through extensive experiments, we show that correlation
dimension (1) reveals three distinct phases during pretraining, (2) reflects
context-dependent complexity, (3) indicates a model's tendency toward
hallucination, and (4) reliably detects multiple forms of degeneration in
generated text. The method is computationally efficient, robust to model
quantization (down to 4-bit precision), broadly applicable across
autoregressive architectures (e.g., Transformer and Mamba), and provides fresh
insight into the generative dynamics of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Permuted Block-Sparse Attention (PBS-Attn)方法，通过利用注意力的置换特性来提高块级稀疏性，在保持模型精度的同时显著提升长上下文预填充的计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型扩展上下文长度具有显著优势但计算成本高昂，主要由于自注意力机制的O(N^2)复杂度。虽然注意力矩阵通常是稀疏的，但现有块稀疏注意力方法的有效性高度依赖于底层注意力模式，可能导致次优的块级稀疏性。

Method: 提出PBS-Attn方法，利用注意力的置换特性来增加块级稀疏性，并开发了自定义的permuted-FlashAttention内核来支持该方法。

Result: 在具有挑战性的真实世界长上下文数据集上的实验表明，PBS-Attn在模型精度上始终优于现有块稀疏注意力方法，并接近完整注意力基线。在长上下文预填充中实现了高达2.75倍的端到端加速。

Conclusion: PBS-Attn是一种即插即用的方法，能够有效提升LLM预填充的计算效率，同时保持模型精度，具有实际可行性。

Abstract: Scaling the context length of large language models (LLMs) offers significant
benefits but is computationally expensive. This expense stems primarily from
the self-attention mechanism, whose $O(N^2)$ complexity with respect to
sequence length presents a major bottleneck for both memory and latency.
Fortunately, the attention matrix is often sparse, particularly for long
sequences, suggesting an opportunity for optimization. Block-sparse attention
has emerged as a promising solution that partitions sequences into blocks and
skips computation for a subset of these blocks. However, the effectiveness of
this method is highly dependent on the underlying attention patterns, which can
lead to sub-optimal block-level sparsity. For instance, important key tokens
for queries within a single block may be scattered across numerous other
blocks, leading to computational redundancy. In this work, we propose Permuted
Block-Sparse Attention (\textbf{PBS-Attn}), a plug-and-play method that
leverages the permutation properties of attention to increase block-level
sparsity and enhance the computational efficiency of LLM prefilling. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on challenging real-world long-context datasets,
demonstrating that PBS-Attn consistently outperforms existing block-sparse
attention methods in model accuracy and closely matches the full attention
baseline. Powered by our custom permuted-FlashAttention kernels, PBS-Attn
achieves an end-to-end speedup of up to $2.75\times$ in long-context
prefilling, confirming its practical viability. Code available at

TL;DR: PARL方法使用大型语言模型作为强化学习智能体，通过提示工程实现无需微调的学习，在简单环境中能匹配或超越传统RL智能体，但在需要复杂数学运算的任务中存在性能限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLMs在语言相关任务中的表现，但缺乏对LLMs在结构化、非语言推理的强化学习任务中作为智能体的评估。

Method: 提出PARL方法，通过提示工程将动作、状态和奖励编码到提示中，使LLM能够通过试错与环境交互学习，无需任何微调。

Result: 在三个不依赖自然语言的标准RL任务中，PARL在简单环境中能匹配或超越传统RL智能体，但在需要复杂数学运算或状态动作解码的任务中表现受限。

Conclusion: LLMs可以作为RL智能体在简单环境中有效工作，但处理复杂数学运算和状态解码的能力仍有待提升。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated high performance on tasks
expressed in natural language, particularly in zero- or few-shot settings.
These are typically framed as supervised (e.g., classification) or unsupervised
(e.g., clustering) problems. However, limited work evaluates LLMs as agents in
reinforcement learning (RL) tasks (e.g., playing games), where learning occurs
through interaction with an environment and a reward system. While prior work
focused on representing tasks that rely on a language representation, we study
structured, non-linguistic reasoning - such as interpreting positions in a grid
world. We therefore introduce PARL (Prompt-based Agent for Reinforcement
Learning), a method that uses LLMs as RL agents through prompting, without any
fine-tuning. PARL encodes actions, states, and rewards in the prompt, enabling
the model to learn through trial-and-error interaction. We evaluate PARL on
three standard RL tasks that do not entirely rely on natural language. We show
that it can match or outperform traditional RL agents in simple environments by
leveraging pretrained knowledge. However, we identify performance limitations
in tasks that require complex mathematical operations or decoding states and
actions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多样性导向的采样器，通过注入语义相似性惩罚来减少冗余输出，提高不确定性估计的样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自由形式问答中，准确估计LLM的语义偶然性和认知不确定性具有挑战性，通常需要大量昂贵的生成过程。

Method: 使用自然语言推理模型在解码过程中注入连续语义相似性惩罚，覆盖自回归和掩码扩散范式，并通过重要性重加权和方差控制来去偏和减少方差。

Result: 在四个QA基准测试中，该方法在相同样本数量下匹配或超越基线方法，并覆盖更多语义簇。

Conclusion: 该框架模块化且无需访问基础LLM的梯度，可作为风险敏感模型部署中不确定性估计的即插即用增强方案。

Abstract: Accurately estimating semantic aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in large
language models (LLMs) is particularly challenging in free-form question
answering (QA), where obtaining stable estimates often requires many expensive
generations. We introduce a diversity-steered sampler that discourages
semantically redundant outputs during decoding, covers both autoregressive and
masked diffusion paradigms, and yields substantial sample-efficiency gains. The
key idea is to inject a continuous semantic-similarity penalty into the model's
proposal distribution using a natural language inference (NLI) model lightly
finetuned on partial prefixes or intermediate diffusion states. We debias
downstream uncertainty estimates with importance reweighting and shrink their
variance with control variates. Across four QA benchmarks, our method matches
or surpasses baselines while covering more semantic clusters with the same
number of samples. Being modular and requiring no gradient access to the base
LLM, the framework promises to serve as a drop-in enhancement for uncertainty
estimation in risk-sensitive model deployments.

*Gianluca Sperduti,Alejandro Moreo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了NLP模型对字母乱序单词（typoglycemia）的鲁棒性，发现英语中很少单词会在字母乱序后产生歧义，且歧义单词的上下文通常足够区分，因此模型性能下降比预期小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类阅读字母乱序单词的能力（typoglycemia现象），以及NLP模型对此类扭曲的鲁棒性，探索模型在多个不同单词在字母乱序后变成相同表示时仍能表现良好的原因。

Method: 分析英国国家语料库量化单词在字母乱序后的歧义程度；评估BERT模型区分歧义形式的能力；通过对比在干净文本和字母乱序文本上训练的BERT变体进行探测实验。

Result: 研究发现英语中相对较少的单词在字母乱序后会产生歧义，且歧义单词的上下文通常足够区分；BERT模型在字母乱序文本上的性能下降比预期要小。

Conclusion: NLP模型对字母乱序的鲁棒性主要源于英语中单词歧义较少，且上下文信息足够进行消歧，这解释了模型在此类扭曲下仍能保持良好性能的原因。

Abstract: Research in linguistics has shown that humans can read words with internally
scrambled letters, a phenomenon recently dubbed typoglycemia. Some specific NLP
models have recently been proposed that similarly demonstrate robustness to
such distortions by ignoring the internal order of characters by design. This
raises a fundamental question: how can models perform well when many distinct
words (e.g., form and from) collapse into identical representations under
typoglycemia? Our work, focusing exclusively on the English language, seeks to
shed light on the underlying aspects responsible for this robustness. We
hypothesize that the main reasons have to do with the fact that (i) relatively
few English words collapse under typoglycemia, and that (ii) collapsed words
tend to occur in contexts so distinct that disambiguation becomes trivial. In
our analysis, we (i) analyze the British National Corpus to quantify word
collapse and ambiguity under typoglycemia, (ii) evaluate BERT's ability to
disambiguate collapsing forms, and (iii) conduct a probing experiment by
comparing variants of BERT trained from scratch on clean versus typoglycemic
Wikipedia text; our results reveal that the performance degradation caused by
scrambling is smaller than expected.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TripTide是首个评估LLM在真实旅行中断情况下修改行程能力的基准，通过建模中断严重程度和旅行者容忍度等维度，全面评估LLM对航班取消、天气关闭等事件的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有旅行规划系统如TripCraft和TravelPlanner虽然能够生成个性化行程，但无法有效应对现实旅行中常见的中断情况，需要评估LLM在动态变化环境中的适应能力。

Method: 采用三重评估方法：1）自动指标评估（意图保持、响应性、适应性）；2）LLM作为评判者自动评估修订质量；3）专家手动评估语义、空间、序列和响应方面的保持情况。

Result: 实验显示LLM在序列一致性和语义稳定性方面表现良好，空间偏差在短途旅行中较大但随行程延长而减小。然而，随着计划长度增加，中断处理能力下降，表明LLM鲁棒性存在局限。

Conclusion: TripTide为评估LLM在现实不确定性下的旅行规划适应性、个性化和韧性建立了基准，揭示了当前模型在长行程中断处理方面的不足。

Abstract: Recent efforts like TripCraft and TravelPlanner have advanced the use of
Large Language Models ( LLMs) for personalized, constraint aware travel
itinerary generation. Yet, real travel often faces disruptions. To address
this, we present TripTide, the first benchmark evaluating LLM's ability to
revise itineraries under realistic disruptions. TripTide models key dimensions
such as disruption severity and traveler tolerance, enabling nuanced assessment
of LLM adaptability to events like flight cancellations, weather closures, or
overbooked attractions. We conduct a threefold evaluation. First, we introduce
automatic metrics including Preservation of Intent (how well the revised plan
maintains feasibility and goals), Responsiveness (promptness and
appropriateness of disruption handling), and Adaptability (semantic, spatial,
and sequential divergence between original and revised plans). Second, we apply
an LLM-as-a-judge approach to automatically assess revision quality. Third, we
perform manual expert evaluation to verify whether revisions preserve semantic,
spatial, sequential, and responsive aspects. Our experiments show that LLMs
maintain strong sequential consistency and semantic stability, while spatial
deviations are larger for shorter trips but decrease with longer ones,
indicating that extended plans encourage better geographic coherence. However,
disruption-handling ability declines as plan length increases, highlighting
limits in LLM robustness. TripTide establishes a benchmark for evaluating
adaptability, personalization, and resilience in LLM-based travel planning
under real-world uncertainty.

TL;DR: 研究发现单轮训练比多轮训练在推理任务中更有效，多轮训练反而会降低单轮推理性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型在推理任务中是否需要多轮训练，因为实际应用通常涉及多轮交互，但训练通常是单轮的

Method: 比较传统单轮训练与三种多轮策略，评估模型在单轮和多轮场景下的表现

Result: 单轮训练的模型在单轮和多轮评估中都表现良好，而多轮训练的模型在单轮推理性能上显著下降

Conclusion: 对于信息完整的任务，鲁棒的单轮训练比多轮训练更有效可靠，多轮训练带来的收益有限且可能损害推理能力

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically
developed through the single-turn reinforcement learning, whereas real-world
applications often involve multi-turn interactions with human feedback, leading
to a potential mismatch between training and deployment conditions. In this
work, we study whether multi-turn training with human feedback is necessary for
reasoning tasks. We compare conventional single-turn training with three
multi-turn strategies and reach contrary conclusions to previous research. We
find that models trained in a single-turn setting generalize effectively to
both single- and multi-turn evaluations, while models trained with multi-turn
strategies exhibit a significant degradation in single-turn reasoning
performance. These results suggest that for tasks with complete information,
robust single-turn training remains more effective and reliable, as multi-turn
training with basic feedback provides limited benefits and can even degrade
reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 现有的瑞典基准大多是翻译自美国中心的数据集，不适合测试瑞典特有的相关知识。

Method: 通过手动编写问答对，参考瑞典文化媒体界的知名人物和主要体育赛事，创建专门针对瑞典的问答基准数据集，并包含英文翻译。

Result: 发现具有更强瑞典覆盖度的小型模型在回忆瑞典相关事实方面与三倍大的多语言模型表现相当；继续在瑞典语上进行预训练通常能提高事实知识，但也会导致部分先前已知信息的遗忘。

Conclusion: 该数据集可作为研究多语言模型中语言适应和知识保留的诊断工具。

Abstract: Many Swedish benchmarks are translated US-centric benchmarks, and therefore
not suitable for testing knowledge that is particularly relevant, or even
specific, to Sweden. We therefore introduce a manually written
question-answering benchmark specifically targeted to Sweden-related
personalities and events, many of which receive very limited coverage in
international media. Our annotators drew inspiration from a popular radio
program featuring public figures from culture and media, as well as major
sports events in Sweden. The dataset can be used to measure factual recall
across models of varying sizes and degrees of Swedish coverage, and allows to
probe cross-lingual factual consistency as to contains English translations.
Using the dataset, we find that smaller models with stronger Swedish coverage
perform comparably to a three times larger multilingual model in recalling
Sweden-related facts. We also observe that continued pre-training on Swedish
generally improves factual knowledge but also leads to forgetting of a part of
the previously known information. These results demonstrate the dataset's
potential as a diagnostic tool for studying language adaptation and knowledge
retention in multilingual models and during language adaptation.

Motivation: 解决形态丰富语言在大规模预训练中代表性不足的问题，为土耳其语NLP提供首个大规模编码器模型。

Method: 使用312GB土耳其语文本（mC4、OSCAR23、维基百科）从头训练RoBERTa基础的编码器模型，发布基础和大型两种配置。

Result: 在词性标注、命名实体识别、冒犯性语言检测和TurBLiMP语言可接受性基准测试中，SindBERT与现有土耳其语和多语言模型表现相当，大型变体在4个任务中的2个表现最佳，但整体未显示一致的规模优势。

Conclusion: SindBERT为土耳其语NLP提供了开源资源，并作为实证案例研究，揭示了在形态丰富语言中规模扩展的局限性和语料库组成的核心作用。

Abstract: Transformer models have revolutionized NLP, yet many morphologically rich
languages remain underrepresented in large-scale pre-training efforts. With
SindBERT, we set out to chart the seas of Turkish NLP, providing the first
large-scale RoBERTa-based encoder for Turkish. Trained from scratch on 312 GB
of Turkish text (mC4, OSCAR23, Wikipedia), SindBERT is released in both base
and large configurations, representing the first large-scale encoder-only
language model available for Turkish. We evaluate SindBERT on part-of-speech
tagging, named entity recognition, offensive language detection, and the
TurBLiMP linguistic acceptability benchmark. Our results show that SindBERT
performs competitively with existing Turkish and multilingual models, with the
large variant achieving the best scores in two of four tasks but showing no
consistent scaling advantage overall. This flat scaling trend, also observed
for XLM-R and EuroBERT, suggests that current Turkish benchmarks may already be
saturated. At the same time, comparisons with smaller but more curated models

scaling and the central role of corpus composition in morphologically rich
languages. The SindBERT models are released under the MIT license and made
available in both fairseq and Huggingface formats.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have advanced NLP, yet Hebrew still lacks a
large-scale RoBERTa encoder which is extensively trained. Existing models such
as HeBERT, AlephBERT, and HeRo are limited by corpus size, vocabulary, or
training depth. We present HalleluBERT, a RoBERTa-based encoder family (base
and large) trained from scratch on 49.1~GB of deduplicated Hebrew web text and
Wikipedia with a Hebrew-specific byte-level BPE vocabulary. Evaluated on NER
and sentiment classification benchmarks, HalleluBERT outperforms both
monolingual and multilingual baselines. HalleluBERT sets a new state of the art
for Hebrew and highlights the benefits of fully converged monolingual

TL;DR: 本文研究了视觉语言模型在人类活动识别中的应用，提出了一种描述性字幕数据集和评估方法，实验表明VLMs在性能上与传统深度学习方法相当甚至更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI的发展，视觉语言模型在医疗健康应用中展现出潜力，但在人类活动识别领域的应用相对较少，且缺乏有效的评估方法。

Method: 引入描述性字幕数据集，提出全面的评估方法来评估VLMs在人类活动识别中的表现，并与最先进的深度学习模型进行对比实验。

Result: 实验结果表明，视觉语言模型在人类活动识别中取得了与传统方法相当的性能，在某些情况下甚至超越了传统方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为视觉语言模型在智能医疗系统中的集成提供了有力的基准，并开辟了新的可能性。

Abstract: As generative AI continues to evolve, Vision Language Models (VLMs) have
emerged as promising tools in various healthcare applications. One area that
remains relatively underexplored is their use in human activity recognition
(HAR) for remote health monitoring. VLMs offer notable strengths, including
greater flexibility and the ability to overcome some of the constraints of
traditional deep learning models. However, a key challenge in applying VLMs to
HAR lies in the difficulty of evaluating their dynamic and often
non-deterministic outputs. To address this gap, we introduce a descriptive
caption data set and propose comprehensive evaluation methods to evaluate VLMs
in HAR. Through comparative experiments with state-of-the-art deep learning
models, our findings demonstrate that VLMs achieve comparable performance and,
in some cases, even surpass conventional approaches in terms of accuracy. This
work contributes a strong benchmark and opens new possibilities for the
integration of VLMs into intelligent healthcare systems.

*Giovanni Trappolini,Florin Cuconasu,Simone Filice,Yoelle Maarek,Fabrizio Silvestri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了UDCG指标，针对RAG系统中LLM处理检索结果的特点，改进了传统IR指标，通过考虑相关文档的正面贡献和干扰文档的负面影响，以及LLM导向的位置折扣，显著提升了与端到端答案准确性的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IR指标基于人类用户按顺序浏览文档的假设，但在RAG系统中，LLM会整体处理所有检索结果，且干扰文档会降低生成质量，导致传统指标无法准确预测RAG性能。

Method: 引入基于效用的标注方案，量化相关段落的正面贡献和干扰段落的负面影响，提出UDCG指标，使用LLM导向的位置折扣来直接优化与端到端答案准确性的相关性。

Result: 在五个数据集和六个LLM上的实验表明，UDCG相比传统指标相关性提升高达36%。

Conclusion: UDCG为将IR评估与LLM消费者对齐提供了关键一步，能够更可靠地评估RAG组件。

Abstract: Traditional Information Retrieval (IR) metrics, such as nDCG, MAP, and MRR,
assume that human users sequentially examine documents with diminishing
attention to lower ranks. This assumption breaks down in Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) systems, where search results are consumed by Large Language
Models (LLMs), which, unlike humans, process all retrieved documents as a whole
rather than sequentially. Additionally, traditional IR metrics do not account
for related but irrelevant documents that actively degrade generation quality,
rather than merely being ignored. Due to these two major misalignments, namely
human vs. machine position discount and human relevance vs. machine utility,
classical IR metrics do not accurately predict RAG performance. We introduce a
utility-based annotation schema that quantifies both the positive contribution
of relevant passages and the negative impact of distracting ones. Building on
this foundation, we propose UDCG (Utility and Distraction-aware Cumulative
Gain), a metric using an LLM-oriented positional discount to directly optimize
the correlation with the end-to-end answer accuracy. Experiments on five
datasets and six LLMs demonstrate that UDCG improves correlation by up to 36%
compared to traditional metrics. Our work provides a critical step toward
aligning IR evaluation with LLM consumers and enables more reliable assessment
of RAG components

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of wearable devices in our daily lives, the
demand and appeal for remote patient monitoring have significantly increased.
Most research in this field has concentrated on collecting sensor data,
visualizing it, and analyzing it to detect anomalies in specific diseases such
as diabetes, heart disease and depression. However, this domain has a notable
gap in the aspect of human-machine interaction. This paper proposes REMONI, an
autonomous REmote health MONItoring system that integrates multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), the Internet of Things (IoT), and wearable devices.
The system automatically and continuously collects vital signs, accelerometer
data from a special wearable (such as a smartwatch), and visual data in patient
video clips collected from cameras. This data is processed by an anomaly
detection module, which includes a fall detection model and algorithms to
identify and alert caregivers of the patient's emergency conditions. A
distinctive feature of our proposed system is the natural language processing
component, developed with MLLMs capable of detecting and recognizing a
patient's activity and emotion while responding to healthcare worker's
inquiries. Additionally, prompt engineering is employed to integrate all
patient information seamlessly. As a result, doctors and nurses can access
real-time vital signs and the patient's current state and mood by interacting
with an intelligent agent through a user-friendly web application. Our
experiments demonstrate that our system is implementable and scalable for
real-life scenarios, potentially reducing the workload of medical professionals
and healthcare costs. A full-fledged prototype illustrating the functionalities
of the system has been developed and being tested to demonstrate the robustness
of its various capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型在推理性能上落后于自回归大语言模型，主要原因是去噪过程中独立生成掩码token未能捕捉token相关性

Method: 提出多奖励优化方法，利用测试时缩放、拒绝采样和强化学习直接优化token相关性，并引入组步和重要性采样策略降低奖励方差

Result: MRO不仅提高了推理性能，还在保持推理基准测试高性能的同时实现了显著的采样加速

Conclusion: 增强token相关性是提升扩散语言模型推理性能的有效途径，多奖励优化方法在性能和效率方面都取得了显著改进

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion language models (DLMs) have presented a
promising alternative to traditional autoregressive large language models
(LLMs). However, DLMs still lag behind LLMs in reasoning performance,
especially as the number of denoising steps decreases. Our analysis reveals
that this shortcoming arises primarily from the independent generation of
masked tokens across denoising steps, which fails to capture the token
correlation. In this paper, we define two types of token correlation:
intra-sequence correlation and inter-sequence correlation, and demonstrate that
enhancing these correlations improves reasoning performance. To this end, we
propose a Multi-Reward Optimization (MRO) approach, which encourages DLMs to
consider the token correlation during the denoising process. More specifically,
our MRO approach leverages test-time scaling, reject sampling, and
reinforcement learning to directly optimize the token correlation with multiple
elaborate rewards. Additionally, we introduce group step and importance
sampling strategies to mitigate reward variance and enhance sampling
efficiency. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MRO not only
improves reasoning performance but also achieves significant sampling speedups
while maintaining high performance on reasoning benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有方法在估计和改进语言模型与大脑对齐时存在参与者依赖性强、受个体数据量影响大的问题，限制了向新参与者的泛化和群体层面的分析。

Method: 采用多参与者脑调优方法，通过微调预训练语音语言模型来联合预测多个参与者的fMRI响应。

Result: 方法使预测新参与者脑数据所需的fMRI数据量减少5倍，整体脑对齐提高达50%，并在新未见数据集上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 多参与者脑调优不仅提高了脑对齐性能，还改善了语义任务的下游表现，表明使用多个参与者的大脑数据进行训练能产生更通用的语义表示，有助于弥合神经科学与AI之间的差距。

Abstract: Pretrained language models are remarkably effective in aligning with human
brain responses elicited by natural language stimuli, positioning them as
promising model organisms for studying language processing in the brain.
However, existing approaches for both estimating and improving this brain
alignment are participant-dependent and highly affected by the amount of data
available per participant, hindering both generalization to new participants
and population-level analyses. In this work, we address these limitations by
introducing a scalable, generalizable brain-tuning method, in which we
fine-tune pretrained speech language models to jointly predict fMRI responses
from multiple participants. We demonstrate that the resulting brain-tuned
models exhibit strong individual brain alignment while generalizing across
participants. Specifically, our method leads to 1) a 5-fold decrease in the
amount of fMRI data needed to predict brain data from new participants, 2) up
to a 50% increase in the overall brain alignment, and 3) strong generalization
to new unseen datasets. Furthermore, this multi-participant brain-tuning
additionally improves downstream performance on semantic tasks, suggesting that
training using brain data from multiple participants leads to more
generalizable semantic representations. Taken together, these findings
demonstrate a bidirectional benefit between neuroscience and AI, helping bridge
the gap between the two fields. We make our code and models publicly available
at https://github.com/bridge-ai-neuro/multi-brain-tuning.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于机制检测的方法来识别RAG系统中的幻觉，通过分离外部上下文和参数知识的贡献，训练回归分类器来预测幻觉，并在多个LLM上验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统虽然整合了外部知识来减少幻觉，但模型仍会生成与检索内容不一致的输出。现有方法通常混淆了外部上下文和参数知识的贡献，需要更准确的幻觉检测机制。

Method: 通过计算外部上下文分数和参数知识分数，分析各层和注意力头的机制信号，训练基于回归的分类器来预测幻觉。使用Qwen3-0.6b作为代理模型进行训练和评估。

Result: 该方法在GPT-5、GPT-4.1等先进LLM和RAGAS、TruLens、RefChecker等基线检测方法上表现优异，且Qwen3-0.6b训练的模型能泛化到GPT-4.1-mini，证明了代理模型评估的潜力。

Conclusion: 机制信号是RAG系统中幻觉检测的高效且可泛化的预测指标，为改进RAG系统的可靠性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external knowledge to
mitigate hallucinations, yet models often generate outputs inconsistent with
retrieved content. Accurate hallucination detection requires disentangling the
contributions of external context and parametric knowledge, which prior methods
typically conflate. We investigate the mechanisms underlying RAG hallucinations
and find they arise when later-layer FFN modules disproportionately inject
parametric knowledge into the residual stream. To address this, we explore a
mechanistic detection approach based on external context scores and parametric
knowledge scores. Using Qwen3-0.6b, we compute these scores across layers and
attention heads and train regression-based classifiers to predict
hallucinations. Our method is evaluated against state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-5,
GPT-4.1) and detection baselines (RAGAS, TruLens, RefChecker). Furthermore,
classifiers trained on Qwen3-0.6b signals generalize to GPT-4.1-mini responses,
demonstrating the potential of proxy-model evaluation. Our results highlight
mechanistic signals as efficient, generalizable predictors for hallucination
detection in RAG systems.

Conclusion: 范畴论为文档结构分析提供了强大的数学框架，支持信息理论分析、内容操作和模型优化，具有扩展到多模态应用的潜力。

Abstract: We apply category theory to extract multimodal document structure which leads
us to develop information theoretic measures, content summarization and
extension, and self-supervised improvement of large pretrained models. We first
develop a mathematical representation of a document as a category of
question-answer pairs. Second, we develop an orthogonalization procedure to
divide the information contained in one or more documents into non-overlapping
pieces. The structures extracted in the first and second steps lead us to
develop methods to measure and enumerate the information contained in a
document. We also build on those steps to develop new summarization techniques,
as well as to develop a solution to a new problem viz. exegesis resulting in an
extension of the original document. Our question-answer pair methodology
enables a novel rate distortion analysis of summarization techniques. We
implement our techniques using large pretrained models, and we propose a
multimodal extension of our overall mathematical framework. Finally, we develop
a novel self-supervised method using RLVR to improve large pretrained models
using consistency constraints such as composability and closure under certain
operations that stem naturally from our category theoretic framework.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在多语言行为上存在显著差异，但语言谱系结构在这种差异中的作用尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过扩展对MultiQ数据集的分析，检查模型在提示语言保真度不足时是否倾向于切换到谱系相关语言，并研究知识一致性在谱系内部和跨谱系的表现。

Result: 发现谱系级别效应存在但强烈受训练资源可用性影响，不同LLM家族表现出不同的多语言策略。

Conclusion: LLMs编码了谱系级别结构的某些方面，但训练数据不平衡仍然是塑造其多语言性能的主要因素。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display notable variation in multilingual
behavior, yet the role of genealogical language structure in shaping this
variation remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs
exhibit sensitivity to linguistic genera by extending prior analyses on the
MultiQ dataset. We first check if models prefer to switch to genealogically
related languages when prompt language fidelity is not maintained. Next, we
investigate whether knowledge consistency is better preserved within than
across genera. We show that genus-level effects are present but strongly
conditioned by training resource availability. We further observe distinct
multilingual strategies across LLMs families. Our findings suggest that LLMs
encode aspects of genus-level structure, but training data imbalances remain
the primary factor shaping their multilingual performance.

Motivation: 随着LLM能力的提升，需要更挑战性的评估来测试超越表面语言能力的语用学理解，包括情境意义和语言文化规范的理解。

Method: 构建了包含405个选择题的语用理解基准，通过翻译困难讨论、建立人类基线活动和LLM试点评估来进行研究。

Result: 当前模型在理解细微语言方面有显著改进，但在推断非字面表达的含义，特别是文化特定表达时仍有困难；专有模型和开源模型之间存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 针对细微语言理解和目标文化知识的基准必须精心设计，最好基于本地数据构建，并通过人类响应进行验证。

Abstract: Large language models are demonstrating increasing capabilities, excelling at
benchmarks once considered very difficult. As their capabilities grow, there is
a need for more challenging evaluations that go beyond surface-level linguistic
competence. Namely, language competence involves not only syntax and semantics
but also pragmatics, i.e., understanding situational meaning as shaped by
context as well as linguistic and cultural norms. To contribute to this line of
research, we introduce SloPragEval and SloPragMega, the first pragmatics
understanding benchmarks for Slovene that contain altogether 405
multiple-choice questions. We discuss the difficulties of translation, describe
the campaign to establish a human baseline, and report pilot evaluations with
LLMs. Our results indicate that current models have greatly improved in
understanding nuanced language but may still fail to infer implied speaker
meaning in non-literal utterances, especially those that are culture-specific.
We also observe a significant gap between proprietary and open-source models.
Finally, we argue that benchmarks targeting nuanced language understanding and
knowledge of the target culture must be designed with care, preferably
constructed from native data, and validated with human responses.

Method: 使用字符级和音节级音位配列特征的无监督异常检测算法，识别词汇表中的音位配列不一致。

Result: 音节感知特征显著优于字符级基线，虽然精确率和召回率因异常性质微妙而保持中等，但高召回方法能有效标记需要验证的条目。

Conclusion: 该方法为田野工作者提供了系统化标记需验证条目的方法，支持低资源语言文档中的数据质量改进。

Abstract: Lexical data collection in language documentation often contains
transcription errors and undocumented borrowings that can mislead linguistic

phonotactic inconsistencies in wordlists, applying them to a multilingual
dataset of Kokborok varieties with Bangla. Using character-level and
syllable-level phonotactic features, our algorithms identify potential
transcription errors and borrowings. While precision and recall remain modest
due to the subtle nature of these anomalies, syllable-aware features
significantly outperform character-level baselines. The high-recall approach

Motivation: 现有大语言模型在股票预测任务中主要依赖分析师观点，缺乏系统性的独立分析逻辑，且未能有效权衡对立证据，限制了其推理能力的发挥。

Method: 提出Reflective Evidence Tuning（RETuning）方法，在强化学习前进行冷启动，鼓励模型从多样化信息源动态构建分析框架，基于框架而非上下文观点来组织和评分证据，最终通过反思得出预测。

Conclusion: RETuning方法通过构建独立分析框架，有效提升了语言模型在股票预测任务中的推理能力，减少了对上下文的过度依赖，实现了更可靠的预测性能。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding
reasoning capabilities on mathematical and coding tasks. However, their
application to financial tasks-especially the most fundamental task of stock
movement prediction-remains underexplored. We study a three-class
classification problem (up, hold, down) and, by analyzing existing reasoning
responses, observe that: (1) LLMs follow analysts' opinions rather than exhibit
a systematic, independent analytical logic (CoTs). (2) LLMs list summaries from
different sources without weighing adversarial evidence, yet such
counterevidence is crucial for reliable prediction. It shows that the model
does not make good use of its reasoning ability to complete the task. To
address this, we propose Reflective Evidence Tuning (RETuning), a cold-start
method prior to reinforcement learning, to enhance prediction ability. While
generating CoT, RETuning encourages dynamically constructing an analytical
framework from diverse information sources, organizing and scoring evidence for
price up or down based on that framework-rather than on contextual
viewpoints-and finally reflecting to derive the prediction. This approach
maximally aligns the model with its learned analytical framework, ensuring
independent logical reasoning and reducing undue influence from context. We
also build a large-scale dataset spanning all of 2024 for 5,123 A-share stocks,
with long contexts (32K tokens) and over 200K samples. In addition to price and
news, it incorporates analysts' opinions, quantitative reports, fundamental
data, macroeconomic indicators, and similar stocks. Experiments show that
RETuning successfully unlocks the model's reasoning ability in the financial
domain. Inference-time scaling still works even after 6 months or on
out-of-distribution stocks, since the models gain valuable insights about stock
movement prediction.

Abstract: Understanding how information is dynamically accumulated and transformed in
human reasoning has long challenged cognitive psychology, philosophy, and
artificial intelligence. Existing accounts, from classical logic to
probabilistic models, illuminate aspects of output or individual modelling, but
do not offer a unified, quantitative description of general human reasoning
dynamics. To solve this, we introduce Information Flow Tracking (IF-Track),
that uses large language models (LLMs) as probabilistic encoder to quantify
information entropy and gain at each reasoning step. Through fine-grained
analyses across diverse tasks, our method is the first successfully models the
universal landscape of human reasoning behaviors within a single metric space.
We show that IF-Track captures essential reasoning features, identifies
systematic error patterns, and characterizes individual differences. Applied to
discussion of advanced psychological theory, we first reconcile single- versus
dual-process theories in IF-Track and discover the alignment of artificial and
human cognition and how LLMs reshaping human reasoning process. This approach
establishes a quantitative bridge between theory and measurement, offering
mechanistic insights into the architecture of reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training方法，通过在适配器训练中为混淆因素建立辅助模块来避免目标属性与偶然因素的纠缠，从而提高生成质量、多样性和提示遵循能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于适配器的训练方法在捕获特定目标属性时，容易将目标属性与姿势、表情、光照等偶然因素纠缠在一起，这种虚假相关性限制了模型的泛化能力和对输入文本提示的遵循能力。

Method: 在适配器训练过程中，为混淆因素建立辅助模块（如ControlNet或LoRA），让这些因素通过这些辅助模块路由，从而消除适配器内部化这些因素的动机。在推理时移除这些辅助模块。

Result: 在面部和全身身份注入等任务中，该方法提高了生成质量、多样性和提示遵循能力。

Conclusion: 在大模型时代，当寻求解耦表示时，最有效的路径可能是为不应该学习的内容建立捷径。

Abstract: Adapter-based training has emerged as a key mechanism for extending the
capabilities of powerful foundation image generators, enabling personalized and
stylized text-to-image synthesis. These adapters are typically trained to
capture a specific target attribute, such as subject identity, using
single-image reconstruction objectives. However, because the input image
inevitably contains a mixture of visual factors, adapters are prone to entangle
the target attribute with incidental ones, such as pose, expression, and
lighting. This spurious correlation problem limits generalization and obstructs
the model's ability to adhere to the input text prompt. In this work, we
uncover a simple yet effective solution: provide the very shortcuts we wish to
eliminate during adapter training. In Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training,
confounding factors are routed through auxiliary modules, such as ControlNet or
LoRA, eliminating the incentive for the adapter to internalize them. The
auxiliary modules are then removed during inference. When applied to tasks like
facial and full-body identity injection, our approach improves generation
quality, diversity, and prompt adherence. These results point to a general
design principle in the era of large models: when seeking disentangled
representations, the most effective path may be to establish shortcuts for what
should NOT be learned.

*Yuxuan Bian,Xin Chen,Zenan Li,Tiancheng Zhi,Shen Sang,Linjie Luo,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VAP提出了一种新的视频生成范式，通过参考视频作为语义提示，在冻结的Video Diffusion Transformer基础上使用混合变换器专家架构，实现了统一、可泛化的语义控制视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视频生成方法在语义控制方面存在的局限性：要么引入伪影，要么依赖不可泛化的条件特定微调或任务特定架构。

Method: 使用参考视频作为直接语义提示，通过插件式混合变换器专家引导冻结的Video Diffusion Transformer，采用时间偏置位置嵌入消除虚假映射先验。

Result: 作为单一统一模型，VAP在开源方法中达到最新技术水平，获得38.7%的用户偏好率，可与领先的条件特定商业模型相媲美。

Conclusion: VAP的强零样本泛化能力和对各种下游应用的支持，标志着向通用可控视频生成迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Unified, generalizable semantic control in video generation remains a
critical open challenge. Existing methods either introduce artifacts by
enforcing inappropriate pixel-wise priors from structure-based controls, or
rely on non-generalizable, condition-specific finetuning or task-specific
architectures. We introduce Video-As-Prompt (VAP), a new paradigm that reframes
this problem as in-context generation. VAP leverages a reference video as a
direct semantic prompt, guiding a frozen Video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) via
a plug-and-play Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) expert. This architecture
prevents catastrophic forgetting and is guided by a temporally biased position
embedding that eliminates spurious mapping priors for robust context retrieval.
To power this approach and catalyze future research, we built VAP-Data, the
largest dataset for semantic-controlled video generation with over 100K paired
videos across 100 semantic conditions. As a single unified model, VAP sets a
new state-of-the-art for open-source methods, achieving a 38.7% user preference
rate that rivals leading condition-specific commercial models. VAP's strong
zero-shot generalization and support for various downstream applications mark a
significant advance toward general-purpose, controllable video generation.

TL;DR: 提出FM-BFF-Net网络，结合CNN和Transformer，使用焦点调制注意力和双向特征融合模块，提升医学图像分割的边界精度和对病变变化的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割对临床诊断和治疗规划至关重要，但传统CNN难以捕获全局上下文信息和长程依赖关系，影响对复杂边界和多样尺寸结构的精确分割。

Method: 结合卷积和Transformer组件，采用焦点调制注意力机制增强上下文感知，引入双向特征融合模块实现编码器和解码器跨尺度特征的高效交互。

Result: 在8个公开数据集上的实验表明，FM-BFF-Net在Jaccard指数和Dice系数上持续超越现有最优方法，验证了其有效性和适应性。

Conclusion: FM-BFF-Net通过融合CNN和Transformer的优势，有效解决了医学图像分割中的全局上下文捕获和特征融合问题，在多种医学成像场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is essential for clinical applications such as
disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease development monitoring
because it provides precise morphological and spatial information on anatomical
structures that directly influence treatment decisions. Convolutional neural
networks significantly impact image segmentation; however, since convolution
operations are local, capturing global contextual information and long-range
dependencies is still challenging. Their capacity to precisely segment
structures with complicated borders and a variety of sizes is impacted by this
restriction. Since transformers use self-attention methods to capture global
context and long-range dependencies efficiently, integrating transformer-based
architecture with CNNs is a feasible approach to overcoming these challenges.
To address these challenges, we propose the Focal Modulation and Bidirectional
Feature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation, referred to as
FM-BFF-Net in the remainder of this paper. The network combines convolutional
and transformer components, employs a focal modulation attention mechanism to
refine context awareness, and introduces a bidirectional feature fusion module
that enables efficient interaction between encoder and decoder representations
across scales. Through this design, FM-BFF-Net enhances boundary precision and
robustness to variations in lesion size, shape, and contrast. Extensive
experiments on eight publicly available datasets, including polyp detection,
skin lesion segmentation, and ultrasound imaging, show that FM-BFF-Net
consistently surpasses recent state-of-the-art methods in Jaccard index and
Dice coefficient, confirming its effectiveness and adaptability for diverse
medical imaging scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GenPT生成式点跟踪框架，通过流匹配建模多模态轨迹，在遮挡点跟踪上达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有判别式模型在不确定性情况下只能回归到均值/众数，无法捕捉多模态轨迹，限制了在视觉遮挡场景下的表现

Method: 使用流匹配训练生成模型，结合判别式跟踪器的迭代优化、跨窗口一致性先验和点坐标专用方差调度

Result: 在PointOdyssey、Dynamic Replica和TAP-Vid基准测试中表现优异，特别是在遮挡点跟踪上达到SOTA，同时在可见点跟踪上保持竞争力

Conclusion: GenPT能够有效捕捉点轨迹的多模态特性，显著提升遮挡点跟踪性能，为不确定性场景下的点跟踪提供了生成式解决方案

Abstract: Tracking a point through a video can be a challenging task due to uncertainty
arising from visual obfuscations, such as appearance changes and occlusions.
Although current state-of-the-art discriminative models excel in regressing
long-term point trajectory estimates -- even through occlusions -- they are
limited to regressing to a mean (or mode) in the presence of uncertainty, and
fail to capture multi-modality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
Generative Point Tracker (GenPT), a generative framework for modelling
multi-modal trajectories. GenPT is trained with a novel flow matching
formulation that combines the iterative refinement of discriminative trackers,
a window-dependent prior for cross-window consistency, and a variance schedule
tuned specifically for point coordinates. We show how our model's generative
capabilities can be leveraged to improve point trajectory estimates by
utilizing a best-first search strategy on generated samples during inference,
guided by the model's own confidence of its predictions. Empirically, we
evaluate GenPT against the current state of the art on the standard
PointOdyssey, Dynamic Replica, and TAP-Vid benchmarks. Further, we introduce a
TAP-Vid variant with additional occlusions to assess occluded point tracking
performance and highlight our model's ability to capture multi-modality. GenPT
is capable of capturing the multi-modality in point trajectories, which
translates to state-of-the-art tracking accuracy on occluded points, while
maintaining competitive tracking accuracy on visible points compared to extant
discriminative point trackers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在3D医学图像中难以对解剖区域进行定位和逐步推理，这限制了与临床诊断工作流程的对齐和可信的临床-AI协作。

Method: 创建了3DReasonKnee数据集，包含7,970个3D膝关节MRI体积，每个样本包含MRI体积、诊断问题、3D边界框定位、临床医生生成的诊断推理步骤和结构化严重程度评估。

Result: 建立了ReasonKnee-Bench评估框架，对五种最先进的VLM进行基准测试，为定位和诊断准确性提供了基线性能。

Conclusion: 3DReasonKnee作为骨科医生诊断专业知识的存储库，为推进多模态医学AI系统向3D、临床对齐的定位决策能力提供了重要测试平台。

Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to ground anatomical regions
in 3D medical images and reason about them in a step-by-step manner, a key
requirement of real-world diagnostic assessment. This ability is essential for
aligning model outputs with the diagnostic workflows clinicians use in
practice, enabling trustworthy clinician-AI collaboration. Existing 3D datasets
provide localization labels, but none support this "grounded reasoning"
ability. To address this gap, we introduce 3DReasonKnee, the first 3D grounded
reasoning dataset for medical images, which provides 494k high-quality
quintuples derived from 7,970 3D knee MRI volumes. Each quintuple includes: (1)
the 3D MRI volume, (2) a diagnostic question targeting a specific anatomical
region (3) a 3D bounding box localizing the relevant anatomical structures, (4)
clinician-generated diagnostic reasoning steps that explicitly detail the 3D
reasoning process, and (5) structured severity assessments for the relevant
anatomical region. The creation and validation of 3DReasonKnee, involving over
450 hours of expert clinician time for manually segmenting MRIs and generating
reasoning chains, ensures its superior quality and clinical relevance. We
establish ReasonKnee-Bench to evaluate localization and diagnostic accuracy,
providing insight into VLM ability to perform grounding and severity assessment
across anatomical regions and diagnostic inquiries. We benchmark five
state-of-the-art VLMs, providing baseline performance for ReasonKnee-Bench. By
providing this unique resource of expert-annotated 3D reasoning pathways,
3DReasonKnee serves as a repository of orthopedic surgeons' diagnostic
expertise and offers a vital testbed for advancing multimodal medical AI
systems towards 3D, clinically aligned, localized decision-making capabilities.

Conclusion: 热偏振成像为3D形状重建提供了一种独立于光照和材料特性的有效方法，特别适用于传统方法难以处理的物体类型。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for detailed 3D shape reconstruction
utilizing thermal polarization cues. Unlike state-of-the-art methods, the
proposed approach is independent of illumination and material properties. In
this paper, we formulate a general theory of polarization observation and show
that long-wave infrared (LWIR) polarimetric imaging is free from the
ambiguities that affect visible polarization analyses. Subsequently, we propose
a method for recovering detailed 3D shapes using multi-view thermal
polarimetric images. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
effectively reconstructs fine details in transparent, translucent, and
heterogeneous objects, outperforming existing techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉基础模型在分布偏移和标注稀缺领域性能下降的问题，传统监督微调不可行，而现有的自监督学习策略对视觉编码器模型效果不佳。

Method: 采用自蒸馏范式，利用多视角物体中心视频进行自监督训练，精心调整预测头并使用参数高效适应技术防止知识遗忘。

Conclusion: VESSA提供了一种有效的无监督视觉基础模型适应方法，能够利用多视角物体观测学习对不同捕获条件的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Foundation models have advanced computer vision by enabling strong
performance across diverse tasks through large-scale pretraining and supervised
fine-tuning. However, they may underperform in domains with distribution shifts
and scarce labels, where supervised fine-tuning may be infeasible. While
continued self-supervised learning for model adaptation is common for
generative language models, this strategy has not proven effective for
vision-centric encoder models. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel
formulation of self-supervised fine-tuning for vision foundation models, where
the model is adapted to a new domain without requiring annotations, leveraging
only short multi-view object-centric videos. Our method is referred to as
VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for visual
foundation models. VESSA's training technique is based on a self-distillation
paradigm, where it is critical to carefully tune prediction heads and deploy
parameter-efficient adaptation techniques - otherwise, the model may quickly
forget its pretrained knowledge and reach a degraded state. VESSA benefits
significantly from multi-view object observations sourced from different frames
in an object-centric video, efficiently learning robustness to varied capture
conditions, without the need of annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
with 3 vision foundation models on 2 datasets, VESSA demonstrates consistent
improvements in downstream classification tasks, compared to the base models
and previous adaptation methods. Code is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有6D位姿估计流程在工业环境中的复杂条件下性能下降，检测成为关键瓶颈，需要解决在杂乱、光照差和复杂背景下的可靠检测问题。

Method: 基于当前SOTA基线，采用低光图像增强和基于开放词汇检测的背景去除技术，抑制原始SAM输出中的误报，为下游位姿估计提供更可靠的检测结果。

Result: 在真实工业bin-picking基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著提升了检测精度，同时引入的推理开销可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 该方法在提升检测精度的同时保持了高效性，证明了其在工业应用中的有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation is essential for robotic manipulation in
industrial environments. Existing pipelines typically rely on off-the-shelf
object detectors followed by cropping and pose refinement, but their
performance degrades under challenging conditions such as clutter, poor
lighting, and complex backgrounds, making detection the critical bottleneck. In
this work, we introduce a standardized and plug-in pipeline for 2D detection of
unseen objects in industrial settings. Based on current SOTA baselines, our
approach reduces domain shift and background artifacts through low-light image
enhancement and background removal guided by open-vocabulary detection with
foundation models. This design suppresses the false positives prevalent in raw
SAM outputs, yielding more reliable detections for downstream pose estimation.
Extensive experiments on real-world industrial bin-picking benchmarks from BOP
demonstrate that our method significantly boosts detection accuracy while
incurring negligible inference overhead, showing the effectiveness and
practicality of the proposed method.

Conclusion: 研究表明通过图像数据收集、标注和深度学习方法，可以在各种损伤情境下实现快速自动化的损伤检测。

Abstract: Timely assessment of integrity of structures after seismic events is crucial
for public safety and emergency response. This study focuses on assessing the
structural damage conditions using deep learning methods to detect exposed
steel reinforcement in concrete buildings and bridges after large earthquakes.
Steel bars are typically exposed after concrete spalling or large flexural or
shear cracks. The amount and distribution of exposed steel reinforcement is an
indication of structural damage and degradation. To automatically detect
exposed steel bars, new datasets of images collected after the 2023 Turkey
Earthquakes were labeled to represent a wide variety of damaged concrete
structures. The proposed method builds upon a deep learning framework, enhanced
with fine-tuning, data augmentation, and testing on public datasets. An
automated classification framework is developed that can be used to identify
inside/outside buildings and structural components. Then, a YOLOv11 (You Only
Look Once) model is trained to detect cracking and spalling damage and exposed
bars. Another YOLO model is finetuned to distinguish different categories of
structural damage levels. All these trained models are used to create a hybrid
framework to automatically and reliably determine the damage levels from input
images. This research demonstrates that rapid and automated damage detection
following disasters is achievable across diverse damage contexts by utilizing
image data collection, annotation, and deep learning approaches.

Method: 利用VLM推理生成丰富的2D场景图，通过深度信息将其接地到3D空间。节点表示具有特征、3D位置和语义上下文的开放词汇对象，边捕获空间和语义关系及物体间距离。

Conclusion: ZING-3D框架能够零样本生成丰富的语义场景表示，支持增量更新和3D几何接地，适用于下游机器人应用。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about complex 3D environments requires structured
scene representations that capture not only objects but also their semantic and
spatial relationships. While recent works on 3D scene graph generation have
leveraged pretrained VLMs without task-specific fine-tuning, they are largely
confined to single-view settings, fail to support incremental updates as new
observations arrive and lack explicit geometric grounding in 3D space, all of
which are essential for embodied scenarios. In this paper, we propose, ZING-3D,
a framework that leverages the vast knowledge of pretrained foundation models
to enable open-vocabulary recognition and generate a rich semantic
representation of the scene in a zero-shot manner while also enabling
incremental updates and geometric grounding in 3D space, making it suitable for
downstream robotics applications. Our approach leverages VLM reasoning to
generate a rich 2D scene graph, which is grounded in 3D using depth
information. Nodes represent open-vocabulary objects with features, 3D
locations, and semantic context, while edges capture spatial and semantic
relations with inter-object distances. Our experiments on scenes from the
Replica and HM3D dataset show that ZING-3D is effective at capturing spatial
and relational knowledge without the need of task-specific training.

TL;DR: WaveSeg是一种新颖的语义分割解码器架构，通过在空间域和小波域联合优化特征细化，利用小波域频率先验和基于Mamba的注意力机制，在保持语义完整性的同时增强高频结构细节，实现了高效精确的分割。

Result: 在标准基准测试上的广泛实验表明，WaveSeg在定量和定性上都持续优于最先进的方法，实现了高效精确的分割。

Conclusion: WaveSeg通过在小波域中结合频率先验和基于Mamba的注意力机制，成功解决了语义分割中语义上下文与细节保存的权衡问题，为语义分割任务提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: While recent semantic segmentation networks heavily rely on powerful
pretrained encoders, most employ simplistic decoders, leading to suboptimal
trade-offs between semantic context and fine-grained detail preservation. To
address this, we propose a novel decoder architecture, WaveSeg, which jointly
optimizes feature refinement in spatial and wavelet domains. Specifically,
high-frequency components are first learned from input images as explicit
priors to reinforce boundary details at early stages. A multi-scale fusion
mechanism, Dual Domain Operation (DDO), is then applied, and the novel Spectrum
Decomposition Attention (SDA) block is proposed, which is developed to leverage
Mamba's linear-complexity long-range modeling to enhance high-frequency
structural details. Meanwhile, reparameterized convolutions are applied to
preserve low-frequency semantic integrity in the wavelet domain. Finally, a
residual-guided fusion integrates multi-scale features with boundary-aware
representations at native resolution, producing semantically and structurally
rich feature maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that WaveSeg, leveraging wavelet-domain frequency prior with Mamba-based
attention, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both
quantitatively and qualitatively, achieving efficient and precise segmentation.

Motivation: 传统深度学习方法在肠肌神经丛分类中表现良好但缺乏可解释性，且不符合医生的决策方式，需要结合专家知识来指导模型学习。

Method: 使用对比语言-图像预训练模型，整合专家来源的文本概念（通过大语言模型生成并人工审核），将临床相关语义线索与视觉特征对齐。

Result: 提出的模型在准确率(83.9%)、精确率(86.6%)和特异性(87.6%)上均优于VGG-19、ResNet-18和ResNet-50等CNN模型。

Conclusion: 多模态学习在组织病理学中具有潜力，整合专家知识可以产生更具临床相关性的模型输出。

Abstract: Hirschsprung's disease is defined as the congenital absence of ganglion cells
in some segment(s) of the colon. The muscle cannot make coordinated movements
to propel stool in that section, most commonly leading to obstruction. The
diagnosis and treatment for this disease require a clear identification of
different region(s) of the myenteric plexus, where ganglion cells should be
present, on the microscopic view of the tissue slide. While deep learning
approaches, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, have performed very well in
this task, they are often treated as black boxes, with minimal understanding
gained from them, and may not conform to how a physician makes decisions. In
this study, we propose a novel framework that integrates expert-derived textual
concepts into a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training-based vision-language
model to guide plexus classification. Using prompts derived from expert sources
(e.g., medical textbooks and papers) generated by large language models and
reviewed by our team before being encoded with QuiltNet, our approach aligns
clinically relevant semantic cues with visual features. Experimental results
show that the proposed model demonstrated superior discriminative capability
across different classification metrics as it outperformed CNN-based models,
including VGG-19, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50; achieving an accuracy of 83.9%, a
precision of 86.6%, and a specificity of 87.6%. These findings highlight the
potential of multi-modal learning in histopathology and underscore the value of
incorporating expert knowledge for more clinically relevant model outputs.

Conclusion: 所提出的HistRetinex模型在保持增强质量的同时显著提升了处理速度，为低光照图像增强提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Retinex-based low-light image enhancement methods are widely used due to
their excellent performance. However, most of them are time-consuming for
large-sized images. This paper extends the Retinex model from the spatial
domain to the histogram domain, and proposes a novel histogram-based Retinex
model for fast low-light image enhancement, named HistRetinex. Firstly, we
define the histogram location matrix and the histogram count matrix, which
establish the relationship among histograms of the illumination, reflectance
and the low-light image. Secondly, based on the prior information and the
histogram-based Retinex model, we construct a novel two-level optimization
model. Through solving the optimization model, we give the iterative formulas
of the illumination histogram and the reflectance histogram, respectively.
Finally, we enhance the low-light image through matching its histogram with the
one provided by HistRetinex. Experimental results demonstrate that the
HistRetinex outperforms existing enhancement methods in both visibility and
performance metrics, while executing 1.86 seconds on 1000*664 resolution
images, achieving a minimum time saving of 6.67 seconds.

Conclusion: 主动视觉推理是视觉推理的重要扩展，当前模型在主动推理能力方面存在根本性差距，需要进一步研究如何让智能体通过交互主动获取和整合信息。

Abstract: Visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has primarily
been studied in static, fully observable settings, limiting their effectiveness
in real-world environments where information is often incomplete due to
occlusion or limited field of view. Humans, in contrast, actively explore and
interact with their environment-moving, examining, and manipulating objects-to
gather information through a closed-loop process integrating perception,
reasoning, and action. Inspired by this human capability, we introduce the
Active Visual Reasoning (AVR) task, extending visual reasoning to partially
observable, interactive environments. AVR necessitates agents to: (1) actively
acquire information via sequential physical actions, (2) integrate observations
across multiple steps for coherent reasoning, and (3) dynamically adjust
decisions based on evolving visual feedback. To rigorously evaluate AVR, we
introduce CLEVR-AVR, a simulation benchmark featuring multi-round interactive
environments designed to assess both reasoning correctness and
information-gathering efficiency. We present AVR-152k, a large-scale dataset
that offers rich Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations detailing iterative
reasoning for uncertainty identification, action-conditioned information gain
prediction, and information-maximizing action selection, crucial for training
agents in a higher-order Markov Decision Process. Building on this, we develop
PhysVLM-AVR, an MLLM achieving state-of-the-art performance on CLEVR-AVR,
embodied reasoning (OpenEQA, RoboVQA), and passive visual reasoning (GeoMath,

detecting information incompleteness, struggle to actively acquire and
integrate new information through interaction, highlighting a fundamental gap

TL;DR: 提出了一种面向城市规模LiDAR的对象中心、不确定性感知变化检测方法，通过多分辨率NDT和点对平面ICP对齐，结合语义实例分割和类别约束二分图匹配，在保持内存效率的同时实现高精度变化检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对垂直偏差、地面坡度和视点失配敏感，且缺乏对象身份信息；基于点或体素的神经网络方法内存需求大，对齐要求高，难以处理分割/合并情况，且忽略不确定性。

Method: 采用多分辨率NDT和点对平面ICP进行时序对齐，高度归一化，基于配准协方差和表面粗糙度计算检测水平；使用几何代理种子跨时序关联，通过语义实例分割和类别约束二分图分配（含虚拟节点）处理分割合并情况；分块处理控制内存，结合3D重叠、法向位移、高度体积差异和直方图距离进行实例级决策。

Result: 在15个Subiaco街区上达到95.2%准确率、90.4% mF1和82.6% mIoU，优于Triplet KPConv方法，在Decreased类别上IoU达到74.8%，提升7.6个百分点。

Conclusion: 该方法在城市规模LiDAR变化检测中表现出色，通过不确定性感知和对象中心处理有效解决了传统方法的局限性，在保持内存效率的同时实现了高精度检测。

Abstract: High-definition 3D city maps underpin smart transportation, digital twins,
and autonomous driving, where object level change detection across bi temporal
LiDAR enables HD map maintenance, construction monitoring, and reliable
localization. Classical DSM differencing and image based methods are sensitive
to small vertical bias, ground slope, and viewpoint mismatch and yield cellwise
outputs without object identity. Point based neural models and voxel encodings
demand large memory, assume near perfect pre alignment, degrade thin
structures, and seldom enforce class consistent association, which leaves split
or merge cases unresolved and ignores uncertainty. We propose an object
centric, uncertainty aware pipeline for city scale LiDAR that aligns epochs
with multi resolution NDT followed by point to plane ICP, normalizes height,
and derives a per location level of detection from registration covariance and
surface roughness to calibrate decisions and suppress spurious changes.
Geometry only proxies seed cross epoch associations that are refined by
semantic and instance segmentation and a class constrained bipartite assignment
with augmented dummies to handle splits and merges while preserving per class
counts. Tiled processing bounds memory without eroding narrow ground changes,
and instance level decisions combine 3D overlap, normal direction displacement,
and height and volume differences with a histogram distance, all gated by the
local level of detection to remain stable under partial overlap and sampling
variation. On 15 representative Subiaco blocks the method attains 95.2%
accuracy, 90.4% mF1, and 82.6% mIoU, exceeding Triplet KPConv by 0.2 percentage
points in accuracy, 0.2 in mF1, and 0.8 in mIoU, with the largest gain on
Decreased where IoU reaches 74.8% and improves by 7.6 points.

Result: 在31种最先进方法中表现出优越的分割性能，适应多个二元目标分割任务。

Conclusion: Controllable-LPMoE方法通过动态先验调制实现了高效微调，在分割任务中表现出卓越性能。

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models provide powerful feature representations for
downstream object segmentation tasks. However, when adapted to specific tasks
through the full-parameter fine-tuning, the enormous parameters being updated
often results in significant computational overhead, creating a bottleneck in
training efficiency. Although existing methods attempt to fine-tune frozen
models by directly embedding trainable prompts, these prompts lack inherent
semantic priors, limiting the adaptability of large-scale models. In this
paper, we propose a novel dynamic priors-based fine-tuning paradigm with fewer
trainable parameters, dubbed Controllable-LPMoE, which adaptively modulates
frozen foundation models by dynamically controlling local priors to enhance
fine-grained perception for specific segmentation tasks. More specifically, we
construct a lightweight dynamic mixed local priors extractor that captures
diverse local priors from input images through heterogeneous convolutions while
employing a gating network to dynamically output expert priors required for the
subsequent fine-tuning. Furthermore, we design a bi-directional interaction
adapter that employs cosine-aligned deformable attention and channel-oriented
adaptive scale enhancement to interact and restructure between frozen and
trainable features, achieving efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our
\href{https://github.com/CSYSI/Controllable-LPMoE} {Controllable-LPMoE}
approach, demonstrating excellent segmentation performance compared to 31
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and adaptability to multiple binary object
segmentation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像安全数据集标签粗糙模糊，无法区分导致安全问题的具体特征。需要系统方法来识别图像中微妙但关键的安全相关特征变化。

Method: 利用图像编辑模型对图像进行针对性修改，仅改变与安全策略相关的特征，从而翻转安全标签，同时保持其他无关细节不变。

Result: 构建了包含3020对SafetyPair图像的基准数据集，发现视觉语言模型在区分微妙差异图像方面存在弱点，该框架还能有效提升轻量级防护模型的训练效率。

Conclusion: SafetyPairs提供了首个系统研究细粒度图像安全差异的资源，既能评估模型弱点，又能作为数据增强策略提升模型性能。

Abstract: What exactly makes a particular image unsafe? Systematically differentiating
between benign and problematic images is a challenging problem, as subtle
changes to an image, such as an insulting gesture or symbol, can drastically
alter its safety implications. However, existing image safety datasets are
coarse and ambiguous, offering only broad safety labels without isolating the
specific features that drive these differences. We introduce SafetyPairs, a
scalable framework for generating counterfactual pairs of images, that differ
only in the features relevant to the given safety policy, thus flipping their
safety label. By leveraging image editing models, we make targeted changes to
images that alter their safety labels while leaving safety-irrelevant details
unchanged. Using SafetyPairs, we construct a new safety benchmark, which serves
as a powerful source of evaluation data that highlights weaknesses in
vision-language models' abilities to distinguish between subtly different
images. Beyond evaluation, we find our pipeline serves as an effective data
augmentation strategy that improves the sample efficiency of training
lightweight guard models. We release a benchmark containing over 3,020
SafetyPair images spanning a diverse taxonomy of 9 safety categories, providing
the first systematic resource for studying fine-grained image safety
distinctions.

Motivation: 现有强化学习框架在提升通用思维链推理时难以超越训练分布的泛化能力

Method: 噪声注入探索策略：用高斯噪声扰动视觉输入；贝叶斯优势估计：将优势估计建模为贝叶斯推理问题

Result: 在CoT质量、通用能力和幻觉基准测试中显著提升了泛化性和鲁棒性，特别是在小规模MLLMs上

Conclusion: NoisyGRPO通过系统化的多模态RL框架有效解决了MLLMs在强化学习训练中的泛化问题

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in enhancing the general
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). However, when applied to improve general CoT reasoning,
existing RL frameworks often struggle to generalize beyond the training
distribution. To address this, we propose NoisyGRPO, a systematic multimodal RL
framework that introduces controllable noise into visual inputs for enhanced
exploration and explicitly models the advantage estimation process via a
Bayesian framework. Specifically, NoisyGRPO improves RL training by: (1)
\textbf{Noise-Injected Exploration Policy}: Perturbing visual inputs with
Gaussian noise to encourage exploration across a wider range of visual
scenarios; and (2) \textbf{Bayesian Advantage Estimation}: Formulating
advantage estimation as a principled Bayesian inference problem, where the
injected noise level serves as a prior and the observed trajectory reward as
the likelihood. This Bayesian modeling fuses both sources of information to
compute a robust posterior estimate of trajectory advantage, effectively
guiding MLLMs to prefer visually grounded trajectories over noisy ones.
Experiments on standard CoT quality, general capability, and hallucination
benchmarks demonstrate that NoisyGRPO substantially improves generalization and
robustness, especially in RL settings with small-scale MLLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL
3B. The project page is available at

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种使用级联CycleGAN从非对比CT生成数字对比CTPA的方法，旨在减少对碘对比剂的依赖，同时保持血管增强效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CTPA是诊断肺血管疾病的金标准，但依赖碘对比剂存在肾毒性和过敏反应风险。本研究旨在开发一种从NCCT生成DCCTPA的方法，避免这些风险。

Method: 使用基于CycleGAN的级联合成器，在410对CTPA和NCCT扫描上进行训练和验证，其中249对用于内部训练验证，161对用于测试。

Result: 该方法在定量指标上表现最佳（MAE: 156.28-165.12，PSNR: 20.27-20.71，SSIM: 0.98），在肺血管分割和血管量化任务中显著优于NCCT输入，血管体积ICC从0.70提升到0.81。

Conclusion: 提出的DCCTPA方法能够有效增强血管结构，特别是小血管，为高风险患者提供了一种无对比剂的替代方案。

Abstract: Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) is the reference standard
for diagnosing pulmonary vascular diseases such as Pulmonary Embolism (PE) and
Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH). However, its reliance on
iodinated contrast agents poses risks including nephrotoxicity and allergic
reactions, particularly in high-risk patients. This study proposes a method to
generate Digital Contrast CTPA (DCCTPA) from Non-Contrast CT (NCCT) scans using
a cascaded synthesizer based on Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial
Networks (CycleGAN). Totally retrospective 410 paired CTPA and NCCT scans were
obtained from three centers. The model was trained and validated internally on
249 paired images. Extra dataset that comprising 161 paired images was as test
set for model generalization evaluation and downstream clinical tasks
validation. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, the proposed method
achieved the best comprehensive performance by evaluating quantitative metrics
(For validation, MAE: 156.28, PSNR: 20.71 and SSIM: 0.98; For test, MAE:
165.12, PSNR: 20.27 and SSIM: 0.98) and qualitative visualization,
demonstrating valid vessel enhancement, superior image fidelity and structural
preservation. The approach was further applied to downstream tasks of pulmonary
vessel segmentation and vascular quantification. On the test set, the average
Dice, clDice, and clRecall of artery and vein pulmonary segmentation was 0.70,
0.71, 0.73 and 0.70, 0.72, 0.75 respectively, all markedly improved compared
with NCCT inputs.\@ Inter-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for vessel volume
between DCCTPA and CTPA was significantly better than that between NCCT and
CTPA (Average ICC : 0.81 vs 0.70), indicating effective vascular enhancement in
DCCTPA, especially for small vessels.

TL;DR: 提出了Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG)框架，用于在基础模型中显式编码空间信息，解决当前视觉空间智能评估中几何信息缺失和语言捷径问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基础模型中视觉空间智能的集成和验证存在挑战，现有方法使用纯文本提示和VQA式评分，掩盖了几何信息，引入了语言捷径，削弱了对真正空间技能的归因。

Method: 引入SIG：一种结构化的网格模式，显式编码物体布局、物体间关系和物理基础先验。作为文本的补充通道，SIG为基础模型推理提供忠实、组合式的场景结构表示。

Result: 在少样本上下文学习中，SIG相比仅使用VQA表示，在所有VSI指标上都产生了更大、更稳定、更全面的增益。同时发布了包含1.4K驾驶帧的SIGBench基准数据集。

Conclusion: SIG作为数据标注和训练模式，在学习和评估视觉空间智能方面具有前景，能够分离空间能力与语言先验。

Abstract: How to integrate and verify spatial intelligence in foundation models remains
an open challenge. Current practice often proxies Visual-Spatial Intelligence
(VSI) with purely textual prompts and VQA-style scoring, which obscures
geometry, invites linguistic shortcuts, and weakens attribution to genuinely
spatial skills. We introduce Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG): a structured,
grid-based schema that explicitly encodes object layouts, inter-object
relations, and physically grounded priors. As a complementary channel to text,
SIG provides a faithful, compositional representation of scene structure for
foundation-model reasoning. Building on SIG, we derive SIG-informed evaluation
metrics that quantify a model's intrinsic VSI, which separates spatial
capability from language priors. In few-shot in-context learning with
state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs (e.g. GPT- and Gemini-family models), SIG
yields consistently larger, more stable, and more comprehensive gains across
all VSI metrics compared to VQA-only representations, indicating its promise as
a data-labeling and training schema for learning VSI. We also release SIGBench,
a benchmark of 1.4K driving frames annotated with ground-truth SIG labels and
human gaze traces, supporting both grid-based machine VSI tasks and
attention-driven, human-like VSI tasks in autonomous-driving scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了Blockwise Flow Matching (BFM)框架，通过将生成轨迹划分为多个时间段，每个段由专门的小型速度块建模，提高推理效率和样本质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Flow Matching模型使用单一大型网络学习从噪声到数据的整个生成轨迹，难以同时捕捉不同时间步的独特信号特征，且推理成本高昂。

Method: 1) 块状设计：将生成轨迹划分为多个时间段，每个段由专门的速度块建模；2) 语义特征引导模块：使速度块基于预训练表示的语义丰富特征；3) 特征残差近似策略：在保持语义质量的同时显著降低推理成本。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256上的实验表明，BFM相比现有Flow Matching方法在相同生成性能下实现了2.1x到4.9x的推理复杂度加速。

Conclusion: BFM框架通过块状设计和语义特征引导，在提高生成质量的同时显著提升了推理效率，建立了更好的Pareto前沿。

Abstract: Recently, Flow Matching models have pushed the boundaries of high-fidelity
data generation across a wide range of domains. It typically employs a single
large network to learn the entire generative trajectory from noise to data.
Despite their effectiveness, this design struggles to capture distinct signal
characteristics across timesteps simultaneously and incurs substantial
inference costs due to the iterative evaluation of the entire model. To address
these limitations, we propose Blockwise Flow Matching (BFM), a novel framework
that partitions the generative trajectory into multiple temporal segments, each
modeled by smaller but specialized velocity blocks. This blockwise design
enables each block to specialize effectively in its designated interval,
improving inference efficiency and sample quality. To further enhance
generation fidelity, we introduce a Semantic Feature Guidance module that
explicitly conditions velocity blocks on semantically rich features aligned
with pretrained representations. Additionally, we propose a lightweight Feature
Residual Approximation strategy that preserves semantic quality while
significantly reducing inference cost. Extensive experiments on ImageNet
256x256 demonstrate that BFM establishes a substantially improved Pareto
frontier over existing Flow Matching methods, achieving 2.1x to 4.9x
accelerations in inference complexity at comparable generation performance.

TL;DR: TokenCLIP是一个基于token级别的自适应框架，通过动态对齐视觉和可学习文本空间来实现细粒度异常检测，解决了现有方法在单一文本空间中对齐不同对象和领域视觉语义的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖单一文本空间来对齐不同对象和领域的视觉语义，这种无差别的对齐方式阻碍了模型准确捕捉多样化的异常语义。

Method: 将token无关的文本空间扩展为一组正交子空间，基于语义亲和力动态分配每个token到子空间组合；将动态对齐表述为最优传输问题，通过OT约束确保子空间间的充分优化；应用top-k掩码稀疏化传输计划，使子空间专注于不同视觉区域。

Result: 大量实验证明了TokenCLIP的优越性能。

Conclusion: TokenCLIP通过token级别的自适应框架实现了视觉和文本空间的动态对齐，在异常检测任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Adapting CLIP for anomaly detection on unseen objects has shown strong
potential in a zero-shot manner. However, existing methods typically rely on a
single textual space to align with visual semantics across diverse objects and
domains. The indiscriminate alignment hinders the model from accurately
capturing varied anomaly semantics. We propose TokenCLIP, a token-wise
adaptation framework that enables dynamic alignment between visual and
learnable textual spaces for fine-grained anomaly learning. Rather than mapping
all visual tokens to a single, token-agnostic textual space, TokenCLIP aligns
each token with a customized textual subspace that represents its visual
characteristics. Explicitly assigning a unique learnable textual space to each
token is computationally intractable and prone to insufficient optimization. We
instead expand the token-agnostic textual space into a set of orthogonal
subspaces, and then dynamically assign each token to a subspace combination
guided by semantic affinity, which jointly supports customized and efficient
token-wise adaptation. To this end, we formulate dynamic alignment as an
optimal transport problem, where all visual tokens in an image are transported
to textual subspaces based on semantic similarity. The transport constraints of
OT ensure sufficient optimization across subspaces and encourage them to focus
on different semantics. Solving the problem yields a transport plan that
adaptively assigns each token to semantically relevant subspaces. A top-k
masking is then applied to sparsify the plan and specialize subspaces for
distinct visual regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
TokenCLIP.

Method: 使用图表示VQA样本，通过知识增强基准演化(KBE)框架，整合多模态知识将静态基准转化为可控动态演化版本，包括重构问题和扩展问题。

Result: 实验表明KBE缓解了数据污染和饱和风险，提供了更全面的MLLM能力评估。

Conclusion: KBE框架为多模态大语言模型提供了更可靠、动态和可控的评估方法。

Abstract: The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) calls for more
reliable evaluation protocols. Existing static benchmarks suffer from the
potential risk of data contamination and saturation, leading to inflated or
misleading performance evaluations. To address these issues, we first apply
Graph formulation to represent a static or dynamic VQA sample. With the
formulation, we propose Knowledge-enhanced Benchmark Evolution(KBE), a dynamic
multimodal evaluation framework. KBE first analyzes the original static
benchmark, then expands it by integrating multimodal knowledge, transforming
the static benchmark into a controllable, dynamic evolving version. Crucially,
KBE can both reconstruct questions by Re-selecting visual information in the
original image and expand existing questions with external textual knowledge.
It enables difficulty-controllable evaluation by adjusting the degree of
question exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KBE alleviates the
risk of data contamination, data saturation, and provides a more comprehensive
assessment of MLLM capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shortcut模型虽然支持单步、少步和多步采样，但由于存在五个关键性能瓶颈（复合引导缺陷、固定引导不灵活、频率偏差、自一致性冲突和弯曲轨迹），限制了其广泛应用。

Method: 提出iSM统一训练框架，包含四个关键改进：内在引导提供动态控制，多级小波损失缓解频率偏差，缩放最优传输减少训练方差，双EMA策略平衡训练稳定性与自一致性。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256上的实验表明，该方法在单步、少步和多步生成中都显著改善了FID分数，使shortcut模型成为有竞争力的生成模型类别。

Conclusion: iSM框架系统性地解决了shortcut模型的关键限制，显著提升了性能，使这类模型在生成建模中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Shortcut models represent a promising, non-adversarial paradigm for
generative modeling, uniquely supporting one-step, few-step, and multi-step
sampling from a single trained network. However, their widespread adoption has
been stymied by critical performance bottlenecks. This paper tackles the five
core issues that held shortcut models back: (1) the hidden flaw of compounding
guidance, which we are the first to formalize, causing severe image artifacts;
(2) inflexible fixed guidance that restricts inference-time control; (3) a
pervasive frequency bias driven by a reliance on low-level distances in the
direct domain, which biases reconstructions toward low frequencies; (4)
divergent self-consistency arising from a conflict with EMA training; and (5)
curvy flow trajectories that impede convergence. To address these challenges,
we introduce iSM, a unified training framework that systematically resolves
each limitation. Our framework is built on four key improvements: Intrinsic
Guidance provides explicit, dynamic control over guidance strength, resolving
both compounding guidance and inflexibility. A Multi-Level Wavelet Loss
mitigates frequency bias to restore high-frequency details. Scaling Optimal
Transport (sOT) reduces training variance and learns straighter, more stable
generative paths. Finally, a Twin EMA strategy reconciles training stability
with self-consistency. Extensive experiments on ImageNet 256 x 256 demonstrate
that our approach yields substantial FID improvements over baseline shortcut
models across one-step, few-step, and multi-step generation, making shortcut
models a viable and competitive class of generative models.

Conclusion: TSSR通过并行生成和解耦策略，在3D网格生成任务中实现了高效且高质量的生成效果，为艺术家风格3D内容创作提供了新方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Topology Sculptor, Shape Refiner (TSSR), a novel
method for generating high-quality, artist-style 3D meshes based on Discrete
Diffusion Models (DDMs). Our primary motivation for TSSR is to achieve highly
accurate token prediction while enabling parallel generation, a significant
advantage over sequential autoregressive methods. By allowing TSSR to "see" all
mesh tokens concurrently, we unlock a new level of efficiency and control. We
leverage this parallel generation capability through three key innovations: 1)
Decoupled Training and Hybrid Inference, which distinctly separates the
DDM-based generation into a topology sculpting stage and a subsequent shape
refinement stage. This strategic decoupling enables TSSR to effectively capture
both intricate local topology and overarching global shape. 2) An Improved
Hourglass Architecture, featuring bidirectional attention enriched by
face-vertex-sequence level Rotational Positional Embeddings (RoPE), thereby
capturing richer contextual information across the mesh structure. 3) A novel
Connection Loss, which acts as a topological constraint to further enhance the
realism and fidelity of the generated meshes. Extensive experiments on complex

TL;DR: SAGE-3D将3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)升级为可执行、语义和物理对齐的环境，包含对象中心语义标注和物理感知执行连接两个组件，并发布了InteriorGS数据集和SAGE-Bench基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS虽然具有逼真的实时渲染能力，但缺乏细粒度语义和物理可执行性，限制了其在视觉语言导航(VLN)中的应用。

Method: 提出SAGE-3D框架，包括：(1)对象中心语义标注，为3DGS添加对象级细粒度标注；(2)物理感知执行连接，嵌入碰撞对象并构建丰富的物理接口。

Result: 发布了包含1K对象标注3DGS室内场景数据的InteriorGS，以及首个基于3DGS的VLN基准SAGE-Bench(含2M VLN数据)。实验显示3DGS场景数据更难收敛但泛化性强，在VLN-CE Unseen任务上提升基线性能31%。

Conclusion: SAGE-3D成功将3DGS升级为语义和物理对齐的可执行环境，为VLN任务提供了更真实的训练和评估平台。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a 3D representation method with photorealistic
real-time rendering capabilities, is regarded as an effective tool for
narrowing the sim-to-real gap. However, it lacks fine-grained semantics and
physical executability for Visual-Language Navigation (VLN). To address this,
we propose SAGE-3D (Semantically and Physically Aligned Gaussian Environments
for 3D Navigation), a new paradigm that upgrades 3DGS into an executable,
semantically and physically aligned environment. It comprises two components:
(1) Object-Centric Semantic Grounding, which adds object-level fine-grained
annotations to 3DGS; and (2) Physics-Aware Execution Jointing, which embeds
collision objects into 3DGS and constructs rich physical interfaces. We release
InteriorGS, containing 1K object-annotated 3DGS indoor scene data, and
introduce SAGE-Bench, the first 3DGS-based VLN benchmark with 2M VLN data.
Experiments show that 3DGS scene data is more difficult to converge, while
exhibiting strong generalizability, improving baseline performance by 31% on
the VLN-CE Unseen task. The data and code will be available soon.

TL;DR: FineRS是一个两阶段多模态大语言模型强化学习框架，通过全局语义探索和局部感知细化的粗到精流程，解决高分辨率图像中极小物体的理解和定位问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于输入分辨率受限，多模态大语言模型在处理高分辨率图像中的极小物体时面临挑战，特别是在杂乱背景中精确定位和识别微小目标。

Method: 采用两阶段粗到精流程：全局语义探索进行指令引导推理生成文本响应和粗略目标区域，局部感知细化将该区域细化为精确边界框和分割掩码，并通过定位感知回顾奖励耦合两个阶段。

Result: 在FineRS-4k数据集和公共数据集上的实验表明，该方法在指令引导分割和视觉推理任务上持续优于现有最先进的多模态大语言模型方法。

Conclusion: FineRS框架有效解决了高分辨率图像中极小物体的精确定位和分割问题，通过强化学习机制提升了多模态大语言模型在视觉细节理解方面的性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities
across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, due to the restricted
input resolutions, MLLMs face significant challenges in precisely understanding
and localizing visual details in high-resolution images -- particularly when
dealing with extra-small objects embedded in cluttered contexts. To address
this issue, we propose \textsc{FineRS}, a two-stage MLLM-based reinforcement
learning framework for jointly reasoning and segmenting extremely small objects
within high-resolution scenes. \textsc{FineRS} adopts a coarse-to-fine pipeline
comprising Global Semantic Exploration (GSE) and Localized Perceptual
Refinement (LPR). Specifically, GSE performs instruction-guided reasoning to
generate a textural response and a coarse target region, while LPR refines this
region to produce an accurate bounding box and segmentation mask. To couple the
two stages, we introduce a locate-informed retrospective reward, where LPR's
outputs are used to optimize GSE for more robust coarse region exploration. %
Additionally, we present \textsc{FineRS}-4k, a new dataset for evaluating MLLMs
on attribute-level reasoning and pixel-level segmentation on subtle,
small-scale targets in complex high-resolution scenes. Experimental results on
\textsc{FineRS}-4k and public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art MLLM-based approaches on both instruction-guided
segmentation and visual reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 提出VL-SAE稀疏自编码器，将视觉-语言表示映射到统一概念集，解释并增强多模态对齐能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型的多模态对齐组件可解释性不足，难以将多模态表示语义映射到统一概念集

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器编码视觉-语言表示，通过余弦相似度显式对齐多模态表示，构建基于距离的编码器和模态特定解码器确保语义相似表示具有一致的神经元激活

Result: 在多个VLM（如CLIP、LLaVA）上验证，VL-SAE能有效解释和增强视觉-语言对齐，在下游任务中提升零样本图像分类和消除幻觉的性能

Conclusion: VL-SAE通过统一概念集成功解释和增强了视觉-语言表示的对齐，为多模态模型提供了更好的可解释性和性能

Abstract: The alignment of vision-language representations endows current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong multi-modal reasoning capabilities.
However, the interpretability of the alignment component remains uninvestigated
due to the difficulty in mapping the semantics of multi-modal representations
into a unified concept set. To address this problem, we propose VL-SAE, a
sparse autoencoder that encodes vision-language representations into its hidden
activations. Each neuron in its hidden layer correlates to a concept
represented by semantically similar images and texts, thereby interpreting
these representations with a unified concept set. To establish the
neuron-concept correlation, we encourage semantically similar representations
to exhibit consistent neuron activations during self-supervised training.
First, to measure the semantic similarity of multi-modal representations, we
perform their alignment in an explicit form based on cosine similarity. Second,
we construct the VL-SAE with a distance-based encoder and two modality-specific
decoders to ensure the activation consistency of semantically similar
representations. Experiments across multiple VLMs (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA)
demonstrate the superior capability of VL-SAE in interpreting and enhancing the
vision-language alignment. For interpretation, the alignment between vision and
language representations can be understood by comparing their semantics with
concepts. For enhancement, the alignment can be strengthened by aligning
vision-language representations at the concept level, contributing to
performance improvements in downstream tasks, including zero-shot image
classification and hallucination elimination. Codes are available at

TL;DR: FORM是一个机器学习框架，用于预测扰动诱导的三维细胞结构变化，通过形态编码器和扩散模型捕捉细胞形态在扰动条件下的演变轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前计算框架仅限于二维表示，无法捕捉细胞形态在扰动下的复杂性，这限制了准确虚拟细胞模型的发展。

Method: FORM包含形态编码器（通过多通道VQGAN端到端训练学习紧凑的3D细胞形状表示）和基于扩散的扰动轨迹模块，在包含65,000多个多荧光3D细胞体积的大规模数据集上训练。

Result: FORM支持无条件形态合成和条件模拟扰动细胞状态，能够预测下游信号活动、模拟组合扰动效应，并建模未见扰动的形态动力学转变。

Conclusion: FORM和MorphoEval通过高分辨率预测模拟将形态、扰动和功能联系起来，推动3D虚拟细胞的实现。

Abstract: Understanding how cells respond to external stimuli is a central challenge in
biomedical research and drug development. Current computational frameworks for
modelling cellular responses remain restricted to two-dimensional
representations, limiting their capacity to capture the complexity of cell
morphology under perturbation. This dimensional constraint poses a critical
bottleneck for the development of accurate virtual cell models. Here, we
present FORM, a machine learning framework for predicting perturbation-induced
changes in three-dimensional cellular structure. FORM consists of two
components: a morphology encoder, trained end-to-end via a novel multi-channel
VQGAN to learn compact 3D representations of cell shape, and a diffusion-based
perturbation trajectory module that captures how morphology evolves across
perturbation conditions. Trained on a large-scale dataset of over 65,000
multi-fluorescence 3D cell volumes spanning diverse chemical and genetic
perturbations, FORM supports both unconditional morphology synthesis and
conditional simulation of perturbed cell states. Beyond generation, FORM can
predict downstream signalling activity, simulate combinatorial perturbation
effects, and model morphodynamic transitions between states of unseen
perturbations. To evaluate performance, we introduce MorphoEval, a benchmarking
suite that quantifies perturbation-induced morphological changes in structural,
statistical, and biological dimensions. Together, FORM and MorphoEval work
toward the realisation of the 3D virtual cell by linking morphology,
perturbation, and function through high-resolution predictive simulation.

TL;DR: 提出CNN-Transformer-CLIP（CT-CLIP）多分支识别框架，结合CNN提取局部病变特征和Vision Transformer捕获全局结构关系，通过自适应特征融合模块动态融合特征，在复杂果园环境中实现苹果叶病害的高精度识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多尺度特征融合方法在处理苹果叶病害的表型异质性时存在局限，无法充分处理局部与全局特征间的关系，特别是在复杂果园环境中病变形态和分布的多样性。

Method: 1. 多分支框架：CNN提取局部病变细节特征，Vision Transformer捕获全局结构关系；2. 自适应特征融合模块动态融合局部和全局特征；3. 多模态图像-文本学习方法，利用预训练CLIP权重实现视觉特征与病害语义描述的深度对齐。

Result: 在公开苹果病害数据集和自建数据集上分别达到97.38%和96.12%的准确率，优于多个基线方法，在复杂环境条件下显著提升识别精度。

Conclusion: CT-CLIP在农业病害识别方面表现出强大能力，为农业应用中的自动化病害识别提供了创新实用的解决方案。

Abstract: In complex orchard environments, the phenotypic heterogeneity of different
apple leaf diseases, characterized by significant variation among lesions,
poses a challenge to traditional multi-scale feature fusion methods. These
methods only integrate multi-layer features extracted by convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and fail to adequately account for the relationships between
local and global features. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-branch
recognition framework named CNN-Transformer-CLIP (CT-CLIP). The framework
synergistically employs a CNN to extract local lesion detail features and a
Vision Transformer to capture global structural relationships. An Adaptive
Feature Fusion Module (AFFM) then dynamically fuses these features, achieving
optimal coupling of local and global information and effectively addressing the
diversity in lesion morphology and distribution. Additionally, to mitigate
interference from complex backgrounds and significantly enhance recognition
accuracy under few-shot conditions, this study proposes a multimodal image-text
learning approach. By leveraging pre-trained CLIP weights, it achieves deep
alignment between visual features and disease semantic descriptions.
Experimental results show that CT-CLIP achieves accuracies of 97.38% and 96.12%
on a publicly available apple disease and a self-built dataset, outperforming
several baseline methods. The proposed CT-CLIP demonstrates strong capabilities
in recognizing agricultural diseases, significantly enhances identification
accuracy under complex environmental conditions, provides an innovative and
practical solution for automated disease recognition in agricultural
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无人机跟踪方法主要关注速度而缺乏语义感知探索，导致在相机运动、快速运动等典型挑战下性能不佳，需要提升搜索区域从模板中提取精确定位信息的能力。

Method: 提出动态语义感知相关建模跟踪框架，核心是动态语义相关性生成器，结合Transformer的相关图探索语义相关性，并设计了剪枝方法来提升跟踪速度。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效提升了无人机跟踪的准确性和鲁棒性，特别是在典型挑战场景下，同时提供了灵活部署选项以适应不同计算资源。

Abstract: UAV tracking can be widely applied in scenarios such as disaster rescue,
environmental monitoring, and logistics transportation. However, existing UAV
tracking methods predominantly emphasize speed and lack exploration in semantic
awareness, which hinders the search region from extracting accurate
localization information from the template. The limitation results in
suboptimal performance under typical UAV tracking challenges such as camera
motion, fast motion, and low resolution, etc. To address this issue, we propose
a dynamic semantic aware correlation modeling tracking framework. The core of
our framework is a Dynamic Semantic Relevance Generator, which, in combination
with the correlation map from the Transformer, explore semantic relevance. The
approach enhances the search region's ability to extract important information
from the template, improving accuracy and robustness under the aforementioned
challenges. Additionally, to enhance the tracking speed, we design a pruning
method for the proposed framework. Therefore, we present multiple model
variants that achieve trade-offs between speed and accuracy, enabling flexible
deployment according to the available computational resources. Experimental
results validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving competitive
performance on multiple UAV tracking datasets. The code is available at

Motivation: 人类注视提供了关于注意力、短期意图和未来行动的有价值线索，是建模自我中心行为的强大信号。

Method: 使用注视正则化注意力机制，仅在训练时使用注视数据，使模型注意力与人类视觉注视对齐，该设计灵活模块化，可适用于多种使用注意力的VLM架构。

Result: 相比无注视正则化的基线模型，未来事件预测的语义预测分数提升高达11分，当前活动理解提升约7分。

Conclusion: 注视引导的训练能显著提高自我中心VLM的准确性和鲁棒性，为在辅助机器人和人机协作等现实场景中使用人类注视增强VLM预测能力奠定了基础。

Abstract: Eye gaze offers valuable cues about attention, short-term intent, and future
actions, making it a powerful signal for modeling egocentric behavior. In this
work, we propose a gaze-regularized framework that enhances VLMs for two key
egocentric understanding tasks: fine-grained future event prediction and
current activity understanding. Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on
visual inputs or use gaze as an auxiliary input signal , our method uses gaze
only during training. We introduce a gaze-regularized attention mechanism that
aligns model focus with human visual gaze. This design is flexible and modular,
allowing it to generalize across multiple VLM architectures that utilize
attention. Experimental results show that our approach improves semantic
prediction scores by up to 11 for future event prediction and around 7 for
current activity understanding, compared to the corresponding baseline models
trained without gaze regularization. These results highlight the value of
gaze-guided training in improving the accuracy and robustness of egocentric
VLMs. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for using human gaze to
enhance the predictive capabilities of VLMs in real-world scenarios like
assistive robots and human-machine collaboration. Code and additional

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了用于MRI和CBCT生成合成CT的统一2.5D U-Net++模型，结合了像素级L1损失和基于SAM与TotalSegmentator的感知损失IMPACT-Synth，通过测试时增强和五折集成提升性能。评估了两种配准策略，发现基于IMPACT的配准能提供更准确的对齐，但训练数据与评估流程一致的Elastix配准在验证集上得分更高，揭示了配准偏差对模型性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决合成CT生成中配准误差传播到监督学习的问题，开发更鲁棒和可泛化的sCT合成模型，通过促进解剖学一致的对齐来减轻配准偏差。

Method: 使用2.5D U-Net++架构，ResNet-34编码器，联合训练各解剖区域并进行区域微调。损失函数结合像素级L1损失和感知损失IMPACT-Synth。采用AdamW优化器，基于补丁的归一化输入，仅使用随机翻转作为数据增强。评估Elastix和IMPACT两种配准策略。

Result: 在本地测试集上，基于IMPACT的配准实现了更准确和解剖学一致的对齐，降低了MAE并生成更真实的解剖结构。但在公共验证集上，使用Elastix对齐数据训练的模型得分更高，反映了与评估流程一致的配准策略带来的偏差。

Conclusion: 配准误差会传播到监督学习中，影响训练和评估，可能以牺牲解剖保真度为代价来提升性能指标。IMPACT通过促进解剖学一致的对齐有助于减轻这种偏差，支持开发更鲁棒和可泛化的sCT合成模型。

Abstract: We participated in the SynthRAD2025 challenge (Tasks 1 and 2) with a unified
pipeline for synthetic CT (sCT) generation from MRI and CBCT, implemented using
the KonfAI framework. Our model is a 2.5D U-Net++ with a ResNet-34 encoder,
trained jointly across anatomical regions and fine-tuned per region. The loss
function combined pixel-wise L1 loss with IMPACT-Synth, a perceptual loss
derived from SAM and TotalSegmentator to enhance structural fidelity. Training
was performed using AdamW (initial learning rate = 0.001, halved every 25k
steps) on patch-based, normalized, body-masked inputs (320x320 for MRI, 256x256
for CBCT), with random flipping as the only augmentation. No post-processing
was applied. Final predictions leveraged test-time augmentation and five-fold
ensembling. The best model was selected based on validation MAE. Two
registration strategies were evaluated: (i) Elastix with mutual information,
consistent with the challenge pipeline, and (ii) IMPACT, a feature-based
similarity metric leveraging pretrained segmentation networks. On the local
test sets, IMPACT-based registration achieved more accurate and anatomically
consistent alignments than mutual-information-based registration, resulting in
improved sCT synthesis with lower MAE and more realistic anatomical structures.
On the public validation set, however, models trained with Elastix-aligned data
achieved higher scores, reflecting a registration bias favoring alignment
strategies consistent with the evaluation pipeline. This highlights how
registration errors can propagate into supervised learning, influencing both
training and evaluation, and potentially inflating performance metrics at the
expense of anatomical fidelity. By promoting anatomically consistent alignment,
IMPACT helps mitigate this bias and supports the development of more robust and
generalizable sCT synthesis models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型采用固定步数的去噪过程，不考虑下游传输限制，在云到设备场景中，有限带宽导致需要重度压缩，造成纹理细节丢失和计算资源浪费。

Method: 引入联合端到端训练策略，将扩散模型条件化于基于可用带宽的目标质量水平，使用轻量级质量嵌入指导去噪轨迹，实现自适应调制去噪过程。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法相比简单的提前停止采样显著提高了带宽适应生成的视觉保真度。

Conclusion: 该方法为带宽受限环境中的高效图像传输提供了有前景的解决方案，仅需最小架构改动。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enable diffusion models to
adapt their generation quality based on real-time network bandwidth
constraints. Traditional diffusion models produce high-fidelity images by
performing a fixed number of denoising steps, regardless of downstream
transmission limitations. However, in practical cloud-to-device scenarios,
limited bandwidth often necessitates heavy compression, leading to loss of fine
textures and wasted computation. To address this, we introduce a joint
end-to-end training strategy where the diffusion model is conditioned on a
target quality level derived from the available bandwidth. During training, the
model learns to adaptively modulate the denoising process, enabling early-stop
sampling that maintains perceptual quality appropriate to the target
transmission condition. Our method requires minimal architectural changes and
leverages a lightweight quality embedding to guide the denoising trajectory.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the
visual fidelity of bandwidth-adapted generations compared to naive
early-stopping, offering a promising solution for efficient image delivery in
bandwidth-constrained environments. Code is available at:

Conclusion: TerraGen展示了强大的跨任务泛化能力，为遥感视觉任务提供了灵活、空间可控的图像生成解决方案。

Abstract: Remote sensing vision tasks require extensive labeled data across multiple,
interconnected domains. However, current generative data augmentation
frameworks are task-isolated, i.e., each vision task requires training an
independent generative model, and ignores the modeling of geographical
information and spatial constraints. To address these issues, we propose
\textbf{TerraGen}, a unified layout-to-image generation framework that enables
flexible, spatially controllable synthesis of remote sensing imagery for
various high-level vision tasks, e.g., detection, segmentation, and extraction.
Specifically, TerraGen introduces a geographic-spatial layout encoder that
unifies bounding box and segmentation mask inputs, combined with a multi-scale
injection scheme and mask-weighted loss to explicitly encode spatial
constraints, from global structures to fine details. Also, we construct the
first large-scale multi-task remote sensing layout generation dataset
containing 45k images and establish a standardized evaluation protocol for this
task. Experimental results show that our TerraGen can achieve the best
generation image quality across diverse tasks. Additionally, TerraGen can be
used as a universal data-augmentation generator, enhancing downstream task
performance significantly and demonstrating robust cross-task generalisation in
both full-data and few-shot scenarios.

Abstract: Image stitching synthesizes images captured from multiple perspectives into a
single image with a broader field of view. The significant variations in object
depth often lead to large parallax, resulting in ghosting and misalignment in
the stitched results. To address this, we propose a
depth-consistency-constrained seamless-free image stitching method. First, to
tackle the multi-view alignment difficulties caused by parallax, a multi-stage
mechanism combined with global depth regularization constraints is developed to
enhance the alignment accuracy of the same apparent target across different
depth ranges. Second, during the multi-view image fusion process, an optimal
stitching seam is determined through graph-based low-cost computation, and a
soft-seam region is diffused to precisely locate transition areas, thereby
effectively mitigating alignment errors induced by parallax and achieving
natural and seamless stitching results. Furthermore, considering the
computational overhead in the shift regression process, a reparameterization
strategy is incorporated to optimize the structural design, significantly
improving algorithm efficiency while maintaining optimal performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method against
the existing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/DLUT-YRH/DSFN.

Abstract: Language and vision-language models have shown impressive performance across
a wide range of tasks, but their internal mechanisms remain only partly
understood. In this work, we study how individual attention heads in
text-generative models specialize in specific semantic or visual attributes.
Building on an established interpretability method, we reinterpret the practice
of probing intermediate activations with the final decoding layer through the
lens of signal processing. This lets us analyze multiple samples in a
principled way and rank attention heads based on their relevance to target
concepts. Our results show consistent patterns of specialization at the head
level across both unimodal and multimodal transformers. Remarkably, we find
that editing as few as 1% of the heads, selected using our method, can reliably
suppress or enhance targeted concepts in the model output. We validate our
approach on language tasks such as question answering and toxicity mitigation,
as well as vision-language tasks including image classification and captioning.
Our findings highlight an interpretable and controllable structure within
attention layers, offering simple tools for understanding and editing
large-scale generative models.

Result: 对3种最先进的视频检索模型、6种基于图像的VLM和10种MLLM进行了广泛评估，揭示了检索方法在处理未修剪视频和多模态查询方面的局限性，以及MLLM在多视频理解和重排序方面的不足。

Conclusion: MUVR基准为长视频平台的多模态未修剪视频检索提供了实用的评估框架，揭示了当前方法的局限性，为未来研究指明了改进方向。

Abstract: We propose the Multi-modal Untrimmed Video Retrieval task, along with a new
benchmark (MUVR) to advance video retrieval for long-video platforms. MUVR aims
to retrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant segments using multi-modal
queries. It has the following features: 1) Practical retrieval paradigm: MUVR
supports video-centric multi-modal queries, expressing fine-grained retrieval
needs through long text descriptions, video tag prompts, and mask prompts. It
adopts a one-to-many retrieval paradigm and focuses on untrimmed videos,
tailored for long-video platform applications. 2) Multi-level visual
correspondence: To cover common video categories (e.g., news, travel, dance)
and precisely define retrieval matching criteria, we construct multi-level
visual correspondence based on core video content (e.g., news events, travel
locations, dance moves) which users are interested in and want to retrieve. It
covers six levels: copy, event, scene, instance, action, and others. 3)
Comprehensive evaluation criteria: We develop 3 versions of MUVR (i.e., Base,
Filter, QA). MUVR-Base/Filter evaluates retrieval models, while MUVR-QA
assesses MLLMs in a question-answering format. We also propose a Reranking
Score to evaluate the reranking ability of MLLMs. MUVR consists of 53K
untrimmed videos from the video platform Bilibili, with 1,050 multi-modal
queries and 84K matches. Extensive evaluations of 3 state-of-the-art video
retrieval models, 6 image-based VLMs, and 10 MLLMs are conducted. MUVR reveals
the limitations of retrieval methods in processing untrimmed videos and
multi-modal queries, as well as MLLMs in multi-video understanding and
reranking. Our code and benchmark is available at

*Whie Jung,Semin Kim,Junee Kim,Seunghoon Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的视觉概念学习框架，能够自适应识别图像相关概念轴并在真实场景中沿这些轴进行视觉概念定位，无需预定义概念类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言引导的视觉概念学习方法局限于少数预定义的基本维度（如颜色、形状），且通常在合成数据集上探索，无法处理真实世界中丰富多样的语义维度。

Method: 利用预训练的视觉语言模型和通用提示策略识别多样化的图像相关轴；通过通用概念编码器自适应地将视觉特征绑定到发现的轴上；优化组合锚定目标确保各轴可独立操作。

Result: 在ImageNet、CelebA-HQ和AFHQ数据集上展示了卓越的编辑能力，能够处理过于多样化而无法手动预定义的真实世界概念；在组合泛化方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架能够自适应地发现和定位视觉概念，在真实世界场景中实现了比现有方法更强大的概念编辑和组合泛化能力。

Abstract: Human intelligence effortlessly interprets visual scenes along a rich
spectrum of semantic dimensions. However, existing approaches to
language-grounded visual concept learning are limited to a few predefined
primitive axes, such as color and shape, and are typically explored in
synthetic datasets. In this work, we propose a scalable framework that
adaptively identifies image-related concept axes and grounds visual concepts
along these axes in real-world scenes. Leveraging a pretrained vision-language
model and our universal prompting strategy, our framework identifies a diverse
image-related axes without any prior knowledge. Our universal concept encoder
adaptively binds visual features to the discovered axes without introducing
additional model parameters for each concept. To ground visual concepts along
the discovered axes, we optimize a compositional anchoring objective, which
ensures that each axis can be independently manipulated without affecting
others. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on subsets of
ImageNet, CelebA-HQ, and AFHQ, showcasing superior editing capabilities across
diverse real-world concepts that are too varied to be manually predefined. Our
method also exhibits strong compositional generalization, outperforming
existing visual concept learning and text-based editing methods. The code is
available at https://github.com/whieya/Language-grounded-VCL.

TL;DR: ArtiLatent是一个生成框架，能够合成具有精细几何结构、准确关节连接和真实外观的人造3D物体。该方法通过变分自编码器将稀疏体素表示和关节属性嵌入统一潜在空间，并使用潜在扩散模型进行多样化采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D物体生成方法难以同时处理几何细节、关节结构和外观真实性，特别是在关节运动时对遮挡区域的处理不足。

Method: 联合建模零件几何和关节动态，使用变分自编码器将稀疏体素和关节属性嵌入潜在空间，训练潜在扩散模型进行采样，并引入关节感知的高斯解码器处理关节相关的可见性变化。

Result: 在PartNet-Mobility和ACD数据集上的实验表明，ArtiLatent在几何一致性和外观保真度方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为关节化3D物体的合成和操作提供了可扩展的解决方案，能够生成物理上合理的多样化样本。

Abstract: We propose ArtiLatent, a generative framework that synthesizes human-made 3D
objects with fine-grained geometry, accurate articulation, and realistic
appearance. Our approach jointly models part geometry and articulation dynamics
by embedding sparse voxel representations and associated articulation
properties, including joint type, axis, origin, range, and part category, into
a unified latent space via a variational autoencoder. A latent diffusion model
is then trained over this space to enable diverse yet physically plausible
sampling. To reconstruct photorealistic 3D shapes, we introduce an
articulation-aware Gaussian decoder that accounts for articulation-dependent
visibility changes (e.g., revealing the interior of a drawer when opened). By
conditioning appearance decoding on articulation state, our method assigns
plausible texture features to regions that are typically occluded in static
poses, significantly improving visual realism across articulation
configurations. Extensive experiments on furniture-like objects from
PartNet-Mobility and ACD datasets demonstrate that ArtiLatent outperforms
existing approaches in geometric consistency and appearance fidelity. Our
framework provides a scalable solution for articulated 3D object synthesis and
manipulation.

### [83] [Anisotropic Pooling for LUT-realizable CNN Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21437)
*Xi Zhang,Xiaolin Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种各向异性池化方法，用于改进基于查找表(LUT)的图像恢复CNN，通过广义中值池化和学习数据依赖的池化系数来替代平均池化，显著提升了图像恢复质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于查找表的CNN图像恢复方法使用平均池化融合不同方向的像素块结果，但这种方法不适合各向异性信号结构，导致性能受限。

Method: 引入广义中值池化方法，并进一步扩展为学习数据依赖的池化系数，使不同方向的像素块贡献能够自适应加权。

Result: 在各种恢复基准测试中，所提出的各向异性池化策略在感知和数值指标上都优于现有的LUT可实现的CNN方法。

Conclusion: 各向异性池化策略能够有效提升基于查找表的图像恢复CNN的性能，是平均池化的有效替代方案。

Abstract: Table look-up realization of image restoration CNNs has the potential of
achieving competitive image quality while being much faster and resource frugal
than the straightforward CNN implementation. The main technical challenge
facing the LUT-based CNN algorithm designers is to manage the table size
without overly restricting the receptive field. The prevailing strategy is to
reuse the table for small pixel patches of different orientations (apparently
assuming a degree of isotropy) and then fuse the look-up results. The fusion is
currently done by average pooling, which we find being ill suited to
anisotropic signal structures. To alleviate the problem, we investigate and
discuss anisotropic pooling methods to replace naive averaging for improving
the performance of the current LUT-realizable CNN restoration methods. First,
we introduce the method of generalized median pooling which leads to measurable
gains over average pooling. We then extend this idea by learning data-dependent
pooling coefficients for each orientation, so that they can adaptively weigh
the contributions of differently oriented pixel patches. Experimental results
on various restoration benchmarks show that our anisotropic pooling strategy
yields both perceptually and numerically superior results compared to existing
LUT-realizable CNN methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenHype提出了一种使用双曲潜在空间表示3D场景层次结构的新方法，解决了现有方法在推理效率和泛化能力方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的显式建模层次结构的方法存在显著局限性：要么需要多次渲染来捕获不同粒度的嵌入，显著增加推理时间；要么依赖预定义的封闭离散层次结构，对现实世界中多样和微妙结构的泛化能力差。

Method: OpenHype使用连续双曲潜在空间表示场景层次结构，利用双曲几何的特性自然编码多尺度关系，并通过潜在空间中的测地路径实现层次结构的平滑遍历。

Result: 该方法在标准基准测试中优于最先进的方法，在3D场景理解方面表现出卓越的效率和适应性。

Conclusion: OpenHype通过双曲几何成功解决了3D场景层次结构建模的挑战，为自主代理提供了更全面的环境理解能力。

Abstract: Modeling the inherent hierarchical structure of 3D objects and 3D scenes is
highly desirable, as it enables a more holistic understanding of environments
for autonomous agents. Accomplishing this with implicit representations, such
as Neural Radiance Fields, remains an unexplored challenge. Existing methods
that explicitly model hierarchical structures often face significant
limitations: they either require multiple rendering passes to capture
embeddings at different levels of granularity, significantly increasing
inference time, or rely on predefined, closed-set discrete hierarchies that
generalize poorly to the diverse and nuanced structures encountered by agents
in the real world. To address these challenges, we propose OpenHype, a novel
approach that represents scene hierarchies using a continuous hyperbolic latent
space. By leveraging the properties of hyperbolic geometry, OpenHype naturally
encodes multi-scale relationships and enables smooth traversal of hierarchies
through geodesic paths in latent space. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on standard benchmarks, demonstrating superior efficiency and
adaptability in 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: Interactive world models that simulate object dynamics are crucial for
robotics, VR, and AR. However, it remains a significant challenge to learn
physics-consistent dynamics models from limited real-world video data,
especially for deformable objects with spatially-varying physical properties.
To overcome the challenge of data scarcity, we propose PhysWorld, a novel
framework that utilizes a simulator to synthesize physically plausible and
diverse demonstrations to learn efficient world models. Specifically, we first
construct a physics-consistent digital twin within MPM simulator via
constitutive model selection and global-to-local optimization of physical
properties. Subsequently, we apply part-aware perturbations to the physical
properties and generate various motion patterns for the digital twin,
synthesizing extensive and diverse demonstrations. Finally, using these
demonstrations, we train a lightweight GNN-based world model that is embedded
with physical properties. The real video can be used to further refine the
physical properties. PhysWorld achieves accurate and fast future predictions
for various deformable objects, and also generalizes well to novel
interactions. Experiments show that PhysWorld has competitive performance while
enabling inference speeds 47 times faster than the recent state-of-the-art
method, i.e., PhysTwin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频异常检测研究主要关注离线场景，而在线VAD由于实时约束和计算强度很少受到关注，需要解决在线VAD的固有复杂性。

Method: 使用预训练大规模模型的流式输入，结合LSTM启发的预测机制来建模过去状态，设计评分队列和异常先验来动态存储最近分数并覆盖监控场景中的所有异常。

Result: 在UCF-Crime和XD-Violence两个大型数据集上的评估表明，MoniTor优于最先进方法，且与弱监督方法竞争而无需训练。

Conclusion: MoniTor通过内存机制和预测机制有效解决了在线VAD的挑战，在无需训练的情况下实现了有竞争力的性能。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to locate unusual activities or behaviors
within videos. Recently, offline VAD has garnered substantial research
attention, which has been invigorated by the progress in large language models
(LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), offering the potential for a more
nuanced understanding of anomalies. However, online VAD has seldom received
attention due to real-time constraints and computational intensity. In this
paper, we introduce a novel Memory-based online scoring queue scheme for
Training-free VAD (MoniTor), to address the inherent complexities in online
VAD. Specifically, MoniTor applies a streaming input to VLMs, leveraging the
capabilities of pre-trained large-scale models. To capture temporal
dependencies more effectively, we incorporate a novel prediction mechanism
inspired by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This ensures the model can
effectively model past states and leverage previous predictions to identify
anomalous behaviors. Thereby, it better understands the current frame.
Moreover, we design a scoring queue and an anomaly prior to dynamically store
recent scores and cover all anomalies in the monitoring scenario, providing
guidance for LLMs to distinguish between normal and abnormal behaviors over
time. We evaluate MoniTor on two large datasets (i.e., UCF-Crime and
XD-Violence) containing various surveillance and real-world scenarios. The
results demonstrate that MoniTor outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is
competitive with weakly supervised methods without training. Code is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VidSplice是一个新颖的视频修复框架，通过解耦视频修复为两个子任务：多帧一致性图像修复和掩码区域运动传播，引入间隔帧先验来指导修复过程，显著提升了时空稳定性和前景对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频修复方法在严重内容退化情况下表现不佳，且往往忽视时空稳定性，导致对视频后半部分控制不足。

Method: 提出VidSplice框架，包含CoSpliced模块进行首帧传播策略，以及上下文控制器模块在帧复制后编码一致性先验，并将拼接视频注入I2V生成主干。

Result: 在多样化视频修复场景中取得竞争性性能，显著改善了前景对齐和运动稳定性，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VidSplice通过解耦修复任务和引入间隔帧先验，有效解决了视频修复中的时空稳定性问题，为视频修复提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent video inpainting methods often employ image-to-video (I2V) priors to
model temporal consistency across masked frames. While effective in moderate
cases, these methods struggle under severe content degradation and tend to
overlook spatiotemporal stability, resulting in insufficient control over the
latter parts of the video. To address these limitations, we decouple video
inpainting into two sub-tasks: multi-frame consistent image inpainting and
masked area motion propagation. We propose VidSplice, a novel framework that
introduces spaced-frame priors to guide the inpainting process with
spatiotemporal cues. To enhance spatial coherence, we design a CoSpliced Module
to perform first-frame propagation strategy that diffuses the initial frame
content into subsequent reference frames through a splicing mechanism.
Additionally, we introduce a delicate context controller module that encodes
coherent priors after frame duplication and injects the spliced video into the
I2V generative backbone, effectively constraining content distortion during
generation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that VidSplice achieves
competitive performance across diverse video inpainting scenarios. Moreover,
its design significantly improves both foreground alignment and motion
stability, outperforming existing approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在胸部X光诊断中的黑盒性质问题，为临床医生提供透明可验证的解释，以增强对自动化诊断的信任并识别潜在失败模式。

Method: 训练基于转码器的稀疏自编码器，在BiomedCLIP诊断分类器上分解医学图像表示，通过100个转码器集成从MIMIC-CXR数据集发现约5,000个单语义模式。

Result: 在五个关键发现上实现竞争性诊断准确性，每个预测可分解为20-50个可解释模式，提供可验证的激活图库，模式涵盖心脏、肺部、胸膜、结构、设备和伪影类别。

Conclusion: 医学AI系统可以同时实现准确性和可解释性，通过透明、临床基础的解释支持更安全的临床部署，关键创新在于从特定诊断目标训练的分类器中提取可解释特征。

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable accuracy in chest X-ray
diagnosis, yet their widespread clinical adoption remains limited by the
black-box nature of their predictions. Clinicians require transparent,
verifiable explanations to trust automated diagnoses and identify potential
failure modes. We introduce CXR-LanIC (Language-Grounded Interpretable
Classifier for Chest X-rays), a novel framework that addresses this
interpretability challenge through task-aligned pattern discovery. Our approach
trains transcoder-based sparse autoencoders on a BiomedCLIP diagnostic
classifier to decompose medical image representations into interpretable visual
patterns. By training an ensemble of 100 transcoders on multimodal embeddings
from the MIMIC-CXR dataset, we discover approximately 5,000 monosemantic
patterns spanning cardiac, pulmonary, pleural, structural, device, and artifact
categories. Each pattern exhibits consistent activation behavior across images
sharing specific radiological features, enabling transparent attribution where
predictions decompose into 20-50 interpretable patterns with verifiable
activation galleries. CXR-LanIC achieves competitive diagnostic accuracy on
five key findings while providing the foundation for natural language
explanations through planned large multimodal model annotation. Our key
innovation lies in extracting interpretable features from a classifier trained
on specific diagnostic objectives rather than general-purpose embeddings,
ensuring discovered patterns are directly relevant to clinical decision-making,
demonstrating that medical AI systems can be both accurate and interpretable,
supporting safer clinical deployment through transparent, clinically grounded
explanations.

Conclusion: 细胞级聚合和组织-细胞交互在细粒度计算病理学中发挥关键作用。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of histopathological images demands integration of
information across spatial and semantic scales, from nuclear morphology and
cellular textures to global tissue organization and disease-specific patterns.
Although recent foundation models in pathology have shown strong capabilities
in capturing global tissue context, their omission of cell-level feature
modeling remains a key limitation for fine-grained tasks such as cancer subtype
classification. To address this, we propose a dual-stream architecture that
models the interplay between macroscale tissue features and aggregated cellular
representations. To efficiently aggregate information from large cell sets, we
propose a receptance-weighted key-value aggregation model, a recurrent
transformer that captures inter-cell dependencies with linear complexity.
Furthermore, we introduce a bidirectional tissue-cell interaction module to
enable mutual attention between localized cellular cues and their surrounding
tissue environment. Experiments on four histopathological subtype
classification benchmarks show that the proposed method outperforms existing
models, demonstrating the critical role of cell-level aggregation and
tissue-cell interaction in fine-grained computational pathology.

videos of closed areas with overlapping multi-camera views, where person
occlusion frequently occurs. Our novel graph-weighted solution updates a

characteristic features. To find the best solution, we deeply investigated all
elements of the MOT process, including feature extraction, tracking, and
community search. Furthermore, GRAP-MOT is equipped with a person's position
estimation module, which gives additional key information to the MOT method,
ensuring better results than methods without position data. We tested GRAP-MOT
on recordings acquired in a closed-area model and on publicly available real
datasets that fulfil the requirement of a highly congested space, showing the
superiority of our proposition. Finally, we analyzed existing metrics used to
compare MOT algorithms and concluded that IDF1 is more adequate than MOTA in
such comparisons. We made our code, along with the acquired dataset, publicly

Abstract: Placental abruption is a severe complication during pregnancy, and its early
accurate diagnosis is crucial for ensuring maternal and fetal safety.
Traditional ultrasound diagnostic methods heavily rely on physician experience,

paper proposes an improved model, EH-YOLOv11n (Enhanced Hemorrhage-YOLOv11n),
based on small-sample learning, aiming to achieve automatic detection of

feature extraction; incorporates a cascaded group attention mechanism to
suppress ultrasound artifacts and occlusion interference, thereby improving
bounding box localization accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate a
detection accuracy of 78%, representing a 2.5% improvement over YOLOv11n and a
13.7% increase over YOLOv8. The model exhibits significant superiority in

Abstract: Vision encoders are indispensable for allowing impressive performance of
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in vision language tasks such as
visual question answering and reasoning. However, existing vision encoders
focus on global image representations but overlook fine-grained regional
analysis. They are limited in fine grained perception due to the scarcity of
fine grained annotated data and the lack of a fine grained pre-training
paradigm. In this paper, we propose GranViT, a novel Vision Transformer that
integrates fine-grained feature extraction with semantic alignment to Large
Language Models (LLMs) via region level autoregressive training. We first
construct Gran-29M, a dataset comprising 2million natural and OCR images paired
with over 180 million high-quality region-level annotations, to enable large
scale fine grained pretraining. Consequently, we develop a
pretraining-adaptation framework along with a self distillation mechanism to
train fine-grained GranViT on Gran-29M. We sufficiently exploit the
fine-grained annotations from Gran-29M to resort to bounding-box-to-caption
regression to enhance localized visual representation of the vision encoder in
the pretraining and caption-to-bounding-box regression to improve vision
feature utilization and localization for LLM in the adaptation. We further
incorporate a self distillation mechanism that imposes explicit localization
constraints on the vision encoder to strengthen its regional reasoning
capability. Extensive experiments show that GranViT surpasses existing vision
encoders and attains strong transferability to varying LLMs. Remarkably, it
achieves state-of-the-art results on fine-grained recognition, multimodal VQA,
and OCR understanding.

key design choices. To address this, we propose a unified perspective that
reframes conditional guidance as fixed point iterations, seeking to identify a
golden path where latents produce consistent outputs under both conditional and
unconditional generation. We demonstrate that CFG and its variants constitute a
special case of single-step short-interval iteration, which is theoretically
proven to exhibit inefficiency. To this end, we introduce Foresight Guidance
(FSG), which prioritizes solving longer-interval subproblems in early diffusion
stages with increased iterations. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets
and model architectures validate the superiority of FSG over state-of-the-art
methods in both image quality and computational efficiency. Our work offers
novel perspectives for conditional guidance and unlocks the potential of
adaptive design.

### [94] [Foley Control: Aligning a Frozen Latent Text-to-Audio Model to Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21581)
*Ciara Rowles,Varun Jampani,Simon Donné,Shimon Vainer,Julian Parker,Zach Evans*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Foley Control是一种轻量级视频引导Foley方法，通过冻结预训练的单模态模型，仅学习它们之间的小型交叉注意力桥接，实现视频到音频的生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要端到端重新训练多模态系统，计算成本高且缺乏模块化。Foley Control旨在保持预训练模型能力的同时，以更少的可训练参数实现视频音频同步。

Method: 将V-JEPA2视频嵌入连接到冻结的Stable Audio Open DiT文本到音频模型，在现有文本交叉注意力后插入紧凑的视频交叉注意力，通过视频token池化减少内存需求。

Result: 在精选的视频音频基准测试中，Foley Control在时间和语义对齐方面表现竞争性，可训练参数远少于最近的多模态系统，同时保持提示驱动的可控性和模块化。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、模块化的视频到Foley生成方案，其桥接设计可扩展到其他音频模态如语音。

Abstract: Foley Control is a lightweight approach to video-guided Foley that keeps
pretrained single-modality models frozen and learns only a small
cross-attention bridge between them. We connect V-JEPA2 video embeddings to a
frozen Stable Audio Open DiT text-to-audio (T2A) model by inserting compact
video cross-attention after the model's existing text cross-attention, so
prompts set global semantics while video refines timing and local dynamics. The
frozen backbones retain strong marginals (video; audio given text) and the
bridge learns the audio-video dependency needed for synchronization -- without
retraining the audio prior. To cut memory and stabilize training, we pool video
tokens before conditioning. On curated video-audio benchmarks, Foley Control
delivers competitive temporal and semantic alignment with far fewer trainable
parameters than recent multi-modal systems, while preserving prompt-driven
controllability and production-friendly modularity (swap/upgrade encoders or
the T2A backbone without end-to-end retraining). Although we focus on
Video-to-Foley, the same bridge design can potentially extend to other audio
modalities (e.g., speech).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Chunk-GRPO方法，将GRPO优化从步级提升到块级，解决了优势归因不准确和忽略生成时序动态的问题，在文本到图像生成中取得了更好的偏好对齐和图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在基于流匹配的文本到图像生成中表现出潜力，但面临两个关键限制：优势归因不准确，以及忽略生成的时序动态特性。

Method: 提出Chunk-GRPO方法，将连续步骤分组为连贯的'块'来捕捉流匹配的内在时序动态，并在块级别优化策略，同时引入可选的加权采样策略来进一步提升性能。

Result: 大量实验表明，Chunk-GRPO在偏好对齐和图像质量方面都取得了优越的结果。

Conclusion: 块级优化为基于GRPO的方法展现了良好前景。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown strong potential for
flow-matching-based text-to-image (T2I) generation, but it faces two key
limitations: inaccurate advantage attribution, and the neglect of temporal
dynamics of generation. In this work, we argue that shifting the optimization
paradigm from the step level to the chunk level can effectively alleviate these
issues. Building on this idea, we propose Chunk-GRPO, the first chunk-level
GRPO-based approach for T2I generation. The insight is to group consecutive
steps into coherent 'chunk's that capture the intrinsic temporal dynamics of
flow matching, and to optimize policies at the chunk level. In addition, we
introduce an optional weighted sampling strategy to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that ChunkGRPO achieves superior
results in both preference alignment and image quality, highlighting the
promise of chunk-level optimization for GRPO-based methods.

*Xuzhao Li,Xuchen Li,Shiyu Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MATrack是一个专门为夜间无人机跟踪设计的多尺度自适应系统，通过三个核心模块解决夜间跟踪的主要技术挑战，在UAVDark135基准测试中性能显著优于现有方法，同时保持81 FPS的实时处理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夜间无人机跟踪面临低光照条件、杂乱背景和频繁视角变化等挑战，现有基于低光增强和域适应的方法在实际无人机系统中存在视觉伪影、计算成本高和难以充分利用动态物体信息等不足。

Method: MATrack系统包含三个核心模块：多尺度层次混合(MHB)增强静态和动态模板间的特征一致性，自适应关键令牌门准确识别复杂背景中的物体信息，夜间模板校准器(NTC)确保长序列中的稳定跟踪性能。

Result: 在UAVDark135基准测试中，MATrack的精确度、归一化精确度和AUC分别比最先进方法提高了5.9%、5.4%和4.2%，同时保持81 FPS的实时处理速度。真实无人机平台测试验证了系统的可靠性。

Conclusion: MATrack能够为夜间搜救和边境巡逻等关键机器人应用提供稳定有效的夜间无人机跟踪支持，在性能和效率方面均表现出色。

Abstract: Nighttime UAV tracking faces significant challenges in real-world robotics
operations. Low-light conditions not only limit visual perception capabilities,
but cluttered backgrounds and frequent viewpoint changes also cause existing
trackers to drift or fail during deployment. To address these difficulties,
researchers have proposed solutions based on low-light enhancement and domain
adaptation. However, these methods still have notable shortcomings in actual
UAV systems: low-light enhancement often introduces visual artifacts, domain
adaptation methods are computationally expensive and existing lightweight
designs struggle to fully leverage dynamic object information. Based on an
in-depth analysis of these key issues, we propose MATrack-a multiscale adaptive
system designed specifically for nighttime UAV tracking. MATrack tackles the
main technical challenges of nighttime tracking through the collaborative work
of three core modules: Multiscale Hierarchy Blende (MHB) enhances feature
consistency between static and dynamic templates. Adaptive Key Token Gate
accurately identifies object information within complex backgrounds. Nighttime
Template Calibrator (NTC) ensures stable tracking performance over long
sequences. Extensive experiments show that MATrack achieves a significant
performance improvement. On the UAVDark135 benchmark, its precision, normalized
precision and AUC surpass state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 5.9%, 5.4% and
4.2% respectively, while maintaining a real-time processing speed of 81 FPS.
Further tests on a real-world UAV platform validate the system's reliability,
demonstrating that MATrack can provide stable and effective nighttime UAV
tracking support for critical robotics applications such as nighttime search
and rescue and border patrol.

TL;DR: TIGER是一个两阶段的文本图像超分辨率框架，通过"先文本后图像"的范式，将字形恢复与图像增强解耦，解决了传统方法在图像质量和文本可读性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成式超分辨率方法在自然图像上表现良好，但会扭曲文本，导致图像质量与文本可读性之间存在根本性权衡。

Method: TIGER采用两阶段框架：首先重建精确的文本结构，然后使用这些结构来指导后续的全图像超分辨率，实现从字形到图像的引导。

Result: 在UltraZoom-ST数据集上的广泛实验表明，TIGER实现了最先进的性能，在保持整体图像质量的同时显著提高了可读性。

Conclusion: TIGER通过解耦文本恢复和图像增强，成功打破了图像质量与文本可读性之间的权衡，为场景文本超分辨率提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Current generative super-resolution methods show strong performance on
natural images but distort text, creating a fundamental trade-off between image
quality and textual readability. To address this, we introduce \textbf{TIGER}
(\textbf{T}ext-\textbf{I}mage \textbf{G}uided
sup\textbf{E}r-\textbf{R}esolution), a novel two-stage framework that breaks
this trade-off through a \textit{"text-first, image-later"} paradigm.
\textbf{TIGER} explicitly decouples glyph restoration from image enhancement:
it first reconstructs precise text structures and then uses them to guide
subsequent full-image super-resolution. This glyph-to-image guidance ensures
both high fidelity and visual consistency. To support comprehensive training
and evaluation, we also contribute the \textbf{UltraZoom-ST} (UltraZoom-Scene
Text), the first scene text dataset with extreme zoom (\textbf{$\times$14.29}).
Extensive experiments show that \textbf{TIGER} achieves
\textbf{state-of-the-art} performance, enhancing readability while preserving
overall image quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 耐药性癫痫术前评估中，MEG记录的发作间期棘波手动检测耗时且易出错，现有自动化方法不适合临床实践，需要开发在真实临床数据上有效的自动检测方法。

Method: 提出基于特征的ANN和CNN两种深度学习模型，在59名患者数据上训练，采用交互式机器学习策略迭代改进标注质量，与现有最优模型比较短时间窗口信号分类性能。

Result: 两种模型在10名测试患者上均优于现有最优模型（F1分数：CNN=0.46，ANN=0.44），交互式学习策略证明模型对噪声标注具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 简单架构的模型在复杂和不完美标注数据上具有鲁棒性，交互式机器学习可加速数据标注，所提模型是有效的自动棘波检测工具。

Abstract: In drug-resistant epilepsy, presurgical evaluation of epilepsy can be
considered. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has been shown to be an effective exam
to inform the localization of the epileptogenic zone through the localization
of interictal epileptic spikes. Manual detection of these pathological
biomarkers remains a fastidious and error-prone task due to the high
dimensionality of MEG recordings, and interrater agreement has been reported to
be only moderate. Current automated methods are unsuitable for clinical
practice, either requiring extensively annotated data or lacking robustness on
non-typical data. In this work, we demonstrate that deep learning models can be
used for detecting interictal spikes in MEG recordings, even when only temporal
and single-expert annotations are available, which represents real-world
clinical practice. We propose two model architectures: a feature-based
artificial neural network (ANN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN),
trained on a database of 59 patients, and evaluated against a state-of-the-art
model to classify short time windows of signal. In addition, we employ an
interactive machine learning strategy to iteratively improve our data
annotation quality using intermediary model outputs. Both proposed models
outperform the state-of-the-art model (F1-scores: CNN=0.46, ANN=0.44) when
tested on 10 holdout test patients. The interactive machine learning strategy
demonstrates that our models are robust to noisy annotations. Overall, results
highlight the robustness of models with simple architectures when analyzing
complex and imperfectly annotated data. Our method of interactive machine
learning offers great potential for faster data annotation, while our models
represent useful and efficient tools for automated interictal spikes detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显著目标检测面临像素级标注成本高的问题，导致相关子任务需要单独训练模型，限制了模型的泛化能力。

Method: 使用多模态扩散管道生成超过139,000张高分辨率图像的S3OD数据集，提出流线型多掩码解码器处理显著目标检测中的固有模糊性，预测多个有效解释。

Result: 仅使用合成数据训练的模型在跨数据集泛化中实现20-50%的错误减少，微调版本在DIS和HR-SOD基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 大规模合成数据和模糊感知架构能显著提升显著目标检测的泛化能力，为数据受限任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Salient object detection exemplifies data-bounded tasks where expensive
pixel-precise annotations force separate model training for related subtasks
like DIS and HR-SOD. We present a method that dramatically improves
generalization through large-scale synthetic data generation and
ambiguity-aware architecture. We introduce S3OD, a dataset of over 139,000
high-resolution images created through our multi-modal diffusion pipeline that
extracts labels from diffusion and DINO-v3 features. The iterative generation
framework prioritizes challenging categories based on model performance. We
propose a streamlined multi-mask decoder that naturally handles the inherent
ambiguity in salient object detection by predicting multiple valid
interpretations. Models trained solely on synthetic data achieve 20-50% error
reduction in cross-dataset generalization, while fine-tuned versions reach
state-of-the-art performance across DIS and HR-SOD benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在资源受限场景下，跨模态对齐模型因数据质量差或数量少而导致的过度自信和性能下降问题

Method: 使用随机扰动引入可控噪声模拟不确定性，结合嵌入平滑校准嵌入空间中的相似度分布

Result: 在多个基准数据集上优于现有方法，仅用CLIP 1/100的训练数据和1/600的GPU时间就达到竞争性结果

Conclusion: Modest-Align为现实世界低资源场景下的跨模态对齐提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Cross-modal alignment aims to map heterogeneous modalities into a shared
latent space, as exemplified by models like CLIP, which benefit from
large-scale image-text pretraining for strong recognition capabilities.
However, when operating in resource-constrained settings with limited or
low-quality data, these models often suffer from overconfidence and degraded
performance due to the prevalence of ambiguous or weakly correlated image-text
pairs. Current contrastive learning approaches, which rely on single positive
pairs, further exacerbate this issue by reinforcing overconfidence on uncertain
samples. To address these challenges, we propose Modest-Align, a lightweight
alignment framework designed for robustness and efficiency. Our approach
leverages two complementary strategies -- Random Perturbation, which introduces
controlled noise to simulate uncertainty, and Embedding Smoothing, which
calibrates similarity distributions in the embedding space. These mechanisms
collectively reduce overconfidence and improve performance on noisy or weakly
aligned samples. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that Modest-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in retrieval
tasks, achieving competitive results with over 100x less training data and 600x
less GPU time than CLIP. Our method offers a practical and scalable solution
for cross-modal alignment in real-world, low-resource scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成模型虽然在潜在扩散变换器和整流流技术方面取得进展，但仍存在几何不一致、运动不稳定和视觉伪影等问题，影响了真实3D场景的呈现效果。3D一致性的视频生成对生成和重建任务具有重要意义。

Method: 采用成对极线几何约束通过基于偏好的优化来对齐扩散模型，直接处理不稳定的相机轨迹和几何伪影。该方法高效地强制执行几何原则，无需端到端可微分性，在静态场景和动态相机上进行训练以确保高质量的测量。

Result: 评估表明，经典几何约束比现代学习指标提供更稳定的优化信号，学习指标会产生噪声目标从而损害对齐质量。模型能够有效地泛化到各种动态内容。

Conclusion: 通过将数据驱动的深度学习与经典几何计算机视觉相结合，提出了一种实用的方法，在不影响视觉质量的情况下生成空间一致的视频。

Abstract: Video generation models have progressed tremendously through large latent
diffusion transformers trained with rectified flow techniques. Yet these models
still struggle with geometric inconsistencies, unstable motion, and visual
artifacts that break the illusion of realistic 3D scenes. 3D-consistent video
generation could significantly impact numerous downstream applications in
generation and reconstruction tasks. We explore how epipolar geometry
constraints improve modern video diffusion models. Despite massive training
data, these models fail to capture fundamental geometric principles underlying
visual content. We align diffusion models using pairwise epipolar geometry
constraints via preference-based optimization, directly addressing unstable
camera trajectories and geometric artifacts through mathematically principled
geometric enforcement. Our approach efficiently enforces geometric principles
without requiring end-to-end differentiability. Evaluation demonstrates that
classical geometric constraints provide more stable optimization signals than
modern learned metrics, which produce noisy targets that compromise alignment
quality. Training on static scenes with dynamic cameras ensures high-quality
measurements while the model generalizes effectively to diverse dynamic
content. By bridging data-driven deep learning with classical geometric
computer vision, we present a practical method for generating spatially
consistent videos without compromising visual quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点云数据在不同领域的训练规模有限，现有方法混合不同领域数据进行MAE预训练，但学到的先验知识与下游任务不匹配，导致性能下降。

Method: 设计异构域适配器，在预训练阶段使用适应模式全面学习不同领域点云信息，在微调阶段使用融合模式增强点云特征；同时引入域特征生成器指导点云特征适应不同下游任务。

Result: 仅需一次预训练，在四个不同点云分析任务中表现优异：ScanObjectNN物体分类达95.18%，Bosphorus面部表情识别达88.45%。

Conclusion: DAP-MAE能有效解决跨域点云数据预训练问题，通过自适应整合知识提升下游任务性能。

Abstract: Compared to 2D data, the scale of point cloud data in different domains
available for training, is quite limited. Researchers have been trying to
combine these data of different domains for masked autoencoder (MAE)
pre-training to leverage such a data scarcity issue. However, the prior
knowledge learned from mixed domains may not align well with the downstream 3D
point cloud analysis tasks, leading to degraded performance. To address such an
issue, we propose the Domain-Adaptive Point Cloud Masked Autoencoder (DAP-MAE),
an MAE pre-training method, to adaptively integrate the knowledge of
cross-domain datasets for general point cloud analysis. In DAP-MAE, we design a
heterogeneous domain adapter that utilizes an adaptation mode during
pre-training, enabling the model to comprehensively learn information from
point clouds across different domains, while employing a fusion mode in the
fine-tuning to enhance point cloud features. Meanwhile, DAP-MAE incorporates a
domain feature generator to guide the adaptation of point cloud features to
various downstream tasks. With only one pre-training, DAP-MAE achieves
excellent performance across four different point cloud analysis tasks,
reaching 95.18% in object classification on ScanObjectNN and 88.45% in facial
expression recognition on Bosphorus.

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上，相比传统蒸馏方法分别获得最高8%和4%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: Gompertz-CNN框架能有效模拟学生模型的学习进程，显著提升知识蒸馏效果。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel dynamic knowledge distillation framework,
Gompertz-CNN, which integrates the Gompertz growth model into the training
process to address the limitations of traditional knowledge distillation.
Conventional methods often fail to capture the evolving cognitive capacity of
student models, leading to suboptimal knowledge transfer. To overcome this, we
propose a stage-aware distillation strategy that dynamically adjusts the weight
of distillation loss based on the Gompertz curve, reflecting the student's
learning progression: slow initial growth, rapid mid-phase improvement, and
late-stage saturation. Our framework incorporates Wasserstein distance to
measure feature-level discrepancies and gradient matching to align backward
propagation behaviors between teacher and student models. These components are
unified under a multi-loss objective, where the Gompertz curve modulates the
influence of distillation losses over time. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10
and CIFAR-100 using various teacher-student architectures (e.g., ResNet50 and
MobileNet_v2) demonstrate that Gompertz-CNN consistently outperforms
traditional distillation methods, achieving up to 8% and 4% accuracy gains on
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively.

Conclusion: IMU+UWB组合在野外多人运动捕捉中展现出巨大潜力，为克服纯IMU方法的局限性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Tracking human full-body motion using sparse wearable inertial measurement
units (IMUs) overcomes the limitations of occlusion and instrumentation of the
environment inherent in vision-based approaches. However, purely IMU-based
tracking compromises translation estimates and accurate relative positioning
between individuals, as inertial cues are inherently self-referential and
provide no direct spatial reference for others. In this paper, we present a
novel approach for robustly estimating body poses and global translation for
multiple individuals by leveraging the distances between sparse wearable
sensors - both on each individual and across multiple individuals. Our method
Group Inertial Poser estimates these absolute distances between pairs of
sensors from ultra-wideband ranging (UWB) and fuses them with inertial
observations as input into structured state-space models to integrate temporal
motion patterns for precise 3D pose estimation. Our novel two-step optimization
further leverages the estimated distances for accurately tracking people's
global trajectories through the world. We also introduce GIP-DB, the first
IMU+UWB dataset for two-person tracking, which comprises 200 minutes of motion
recordings from 14 participants. In our evaluation, Group Inertial Poser
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness across
synthetic and real-world data, showing the promise of IMU+UWB-based multi-human
motion capture in the wild. Code, models, dataset:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NACTI数据集存在严重的类别不平衡问题，最大类别覆盖超过50%的数据，需要专门的长尾识别方法来改善物种识别性能。

Method: 基于PyTorch Wildlife模型，系统研究了多种LTR损失函数和LTR敏感的正则化方法，构建了减少偏差的测试集来评估域偏移。

Result: 最佳配置在NACTI测试集上达到99.40% Top-1准确率，在跨域测试中达到52.55%准确率，相比基线有显著提升。

Conclusion: LTR方法在野生动物识别领域有效，但仍有局限性，特别是在严重域偏移下对尾部类别的识别存在灾难性失效问题。

Abstract: As most ''in the wild'' data collections of the natural world, the North
America Camera Trap Images (NACTI) dataset shows severe long-tailed class
imbalance, noting that the largest 'Head' class alone covers >50% of the 3.7M
images in the corpus. Building on the PyTorch Wildlife model, we present a
systematic study of Long-Tail Recognition methodologies for species recognition
on the NACTI dataset covering experiments on various LTR loss functions plus
LTR-sensitive regularisation. Our best configuration achieves 99.40% Top-1
accuracy on our NACTI test data split, substantially improving over a 95.51%
baseline using standard cross-entropy with Adam. This also improves on
previously reported top performance in MLWIC2 at 96.8% albeit using partly
unpublished (potentially different) partitioning, optimiser, and evaluation
protocols. To evaluate domain shifts (e.g. night-time captures, occlusion,
motion-blur) towards other datasets we construct a Reduced-Bias Test set from
the ENA-Detection dataset where our experimentally optimised long-tail enhanced
model achieves leading 52.55% accuracy (up from 51.20% with WCE loss),
demonstrating stronger generalisation capabilities under distribution shift. We
document the consistent improvements of LTR-enhancing scheduler choices in this
NACTI wildlife domain, particularly when in tandem with state-of-the-art LTR
losses. We finally discuss qualitative and quantitative shortcomings that LTR
methods cannot sufficiently address, including catastrophic breakdown for
'Tail' classes under severe domain shift. For maximum reproducibility we
publish all dataset splits, key code, and full network weights.

Result: 成功分离突触类别，提供选择覆盖突触结构范围的地面实况的原则性方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为突触分类提供了一种无需预先知道类型数量的无监督解决方案，具有生物学应用潜力。

Abstract: Separating synapses into different classes based on their appearance in EM
images has many applications in biology. Examples may include assigning a
neurotransmitter to a particular class, or separating synapses whose strength
can be modulated from those whose strength is fixed. Traditionally, this has
been done in a supervised manner, giving the classification algorithm examples
of the different classes. Here we instead separate synapses into classes based
only on the observation that nearby synapses in the same neuron are likely more
similar than synapses chosen randomly from different cells. We apply our
methodology to data from {\it Drosophila}. Our approach has the advantage that
the number of synapse types does not need to be known in advance. It may also
provide a principled way to select ground-truth that spans the range of synapse
structure.

Abstract: The rapid generation of whole-slide images (WSIs) in dermatopathology
necessitates automated methods for efficient processing and accurate
classification. This study evaluates the performance of two foundation models,
UNI and Virchow2, as feature extractors for classifying WSIs into three
diagnostic categories: melanocytic, basaloid, and squamous lesions. Patch-level
embeddings were aggregated into slide-level features using a mean-aggregation
strategy and subsequently used to train multiple machine learning classifiers,
including logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees, and random forest
models. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, true positive rate,
false positive rate, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUROC) on the test set. Results demonstrate that patch-level features
extracted using Virchow2 outperformed those extracted via UNI across most
slide-level classifiers, with logistic regression achieving the highest
accuracy (90%) for Virchow2, though the difference was not statistically
significant. The study also explored data augmentation techniques and image
normalization to enhance model robustness and generalizability. The
mean-aggregation approach provided reliable slide-level feature
representations. All experimental results and metrics were tracked and
visualized using WandB.ai, facilitating reproducibility and interpretability.
This research highlights the potential of foundation models for automated WSI
classification, providing a scalable and effective approach for
dermatopathological diagnosis while paving the way for future advancements in
slide-level representation learning.

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of generating the infinitely extendable 3D world --
large, continuous environments with coherent geometry and realistic appearance.
Existing methods face key challenges: 2D-lifting approaches suffer from
geometric and appearance inconsistencies across views, 3D implicit
representations are hard to scale up, and current 3D foundation models are
mostly object-centric, limiting their applicability to scene-level generation.
Our key insight is leveraging strong generation priors from pre-trained 3D
models for structured scene block generation. To this end, we propose
WorldGrow, a hierarchical framework for unbounded 3D scene synthesis. Our
method features three core components: (1) a data curation pipeline that
extracts high-quality scene blocks for training, making the 3D structured
latent representations suitable for scene generation; (2) a 3D block inpainting
mechanism that enables context-aware scene extension; and (3) a coarse-to-fine
generation strategy that ensures both global layout plausibility and local
geometric/textural fidelity. Evaluated on the large-scale 3D-FRONT dataset,
WorldGrow achieves SOTA performance in geometry reconstruction, while uniquely
supporting infinite scene generation with photorealistic and structurally
consistent outputs. These results highlight its capability for constructing
large-scale virtual environments and potential for building future world
models.

Abstract: Computer vision can accelerate ecological research and conservation
monitoring, yet adoption in ecology lags in part because of a lack of trust in
black-box neural-network-based models. We seek to address this challenge by
applying post-hoc explanations to provide evidence for predictions and document
limitations that are important to field deployment. Using aerial imagery from
Glacier Bay National Park, we train a Faster R-CNN to detect pinnipeds (harbor
seals) and generate explanations via gradient-based class activation mapping
(HiResCAM, LayerCAM), local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME),
and perturbation-based explanations. We assess explanations along three axes
relevant to field use: (i) localization fidelity: whether high-attribution
regions coincide with the animal rather than background context; (ii)
faithfulness: whether deletion/insertion tests produce changes in detector
confidence; and (iii) diagnostic utility: whether explanations reveal
systematic failure modes. Explanations concentrate on seal torsos and contours
rather than surrounding ice/rock, and removal of the seals reduces detection
confidence, providing model-evidence for true positives. The analysis also
uncovers recurrent error sources, including confusion between seals and black
ice and rocks. We translate these findings into actionable next steps for model
development, including more targeted data curation and augmentation. By pairing
object detection with post-hoc explainability, we can move beyond "black-box"
predictions toward auditable, decision-supporting tools for conservation
monitoring.

Conclusion: BachVid提供了一种新颖高效的解决方案，无需依赖参考图像或额外训练即可实现一致视频生成。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently driven significant progress in
text-to-video (T2V) generation. However, generating multiple videos with
consistent characters and backgrounds remains a significant challenge. Existing
methods typically rely on reference images or extensive training, and often
only address character consistency, leaving background consistency to
image-to-video models. We introduce BachVid, the first training-free method
that achieves consistent video generation without needing any reference images.
Our approach is based on a systematic analysis of DiT's attention mechanism and
intermediate features, revealing its ability to extract foreground masks and
identify matching points during the denoising process. Our method leverages
this finding by first generating an identity video and caching the intermediate
variables, and then inject these cached variables into corresponding positions
in newly generated videos, ensuring both foreground and background consistency
across multiple videos. Experimental results demonstrate that BachVid achieves
robust consistency in generated videos without requiring additional training,
offering a novel and efficient solution for consistent video generation without
relying on reference images or additional training.

Abstract: In this paper we show that visual diffusion models can serve as effective
geometric solvers: they can directly reason about geometric problems by working
in pixel space. We first demonstrate this on the Inscribed Square Problem, a
long-standing problem in geometry that asks whether every Jordan curve contains
four points forming a square. We then extend the approach to two other
well-known hard geometric problems: the Steiner Tree Problem and the Simple
Polygon Problem.
  Our method treats each problem instance as an image and trains a standard
visual diffusion model that transforms Gaussian noise into an image
representing a valid approximate solution that closely matches the exact one.
The model learns to transform noisy geometric structures into correct
configurations, effectively recasting geometric reasoning as image generation.
  Unlike prior work that necessitates specialized architectures and
domain-specific adaptations when applying diffusion to parametric geometric
representations, we employ a standard visual diffusion model that operates on
the visual representation of the problem. This simplicity highlights a
surprising bridge between generative modeling and geometric problem solving.
Beyond the specific problems studied here, our results point toward a broader
paradigm: operating in image space provides a general and practical framework
for approximating notoriously hard problems, and opens the door to tackling a
far wider class of challenging geometric tasks.

Abstract: When a vision model performs image recognition, which visual attributes drive
its predictions? Detecting unintended reliance on specific visual features is
critical for ensuring model robustness, preventing overfitting, and avoiding
spurious correlations. We introduce an automated framework for detecting such
dependencies in trained vision models. At the core of our method is a
self-reflective agent that systematically generates and tests hypotheses about
visual attributes that a model may rely on. This process is iterative: the
agent refines its hypotheses based on experimental outcomes and uses a
self-evaluation protocol to assess whether its findings accurately explain
model behavior. When inconsistencies arise, the agent self-reflects over its
findings and triggers a new cycle of experimentation. We evaluate our approach
on a novel benchmark of 130 models designed to exhibit diverse visual attribute
dependencies across 18 categories. Our results show that the agent's
performance consistently improves with self-reflection, with a significant
performance increase over non-reflective baselines. We further demonstrate that
the agent identifies real-world visual attribute dependencies in
state-of-the-art models, including CLIP's vision encoder and the YOLOv8 object
detector.
