### [1] [Contextual Augmentation for Entity Linking using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18888)
*Daniel Vollmers,Hamada M. Zahera,Diego Moussallem,Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合实体识别与消歧的统一框架，利用大语言模型丰富实体上下文，在跨领域数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统实体链接方法采用分步处理，计算量大且效果有限，需要更高效的统一解决方案。

Method: 使用微调模型将实体识别和消歧整合到统一框架中，并利用大语言模型增强实体上下文表示。

Result: 在基准数据集上的评估显示，该方法在跨领域数据集上达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: 联合实体识别与消歧的统一框架结合大语言模型能够显著提升实体链接性能，特别是在跨领域场景中。

Abstract: Entity Linking involves detecting and linking entity mentions in natural
language texts to a knowledge graph. Traditional methods use a two-step process
with separate models for entity recognition and disambiguation, which can be
computationally intensive and less effective. We propose a fine-tuned model
that jointly integrates entity recognition and disambiguation in a unified
framework. Furthermore, our approach leverages large language models to enrich
the context of entity mentions, yielding better performance in entity
disambiguation. We evaluated our approach on benchmark datasets and compared
with several baselines. The evaluation results show that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on out-of-domain datasets.

### [2] [Small Language Models Offer Significant Potential for Science Community](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18890)
*Jian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发了一个使用小型语言模型(MiniLMs)从地球科学文献中精确、快速、经济高效地检索信息的框架，替代大型语言模型(LLMs)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型在自然语言处理中应用日益广泛，但存在信息偏见和计算成本高的担忧，需要探索更精确、经济的信息检索方法。

Method: 构建了包含约7700万高质量句子的地球科学文献语料库，使用MiniLMs通过语义搜索和句子级索引技术进行高效信息提取，并进行情感分析和无监督聚类分析。

Result: MiniLMs能够有效识别大量经过专家验证的多学科信息，特别擅长提取定量研究结果，并能追踪地球科学领域结论演变、研究重点和新兴问题。

Conclusion: MiniLM在地球科学社区具有重要应用潜力，可用于事实和图像检索、趋势分析、矛盾分析和教育目的。

Abstract: Recent advancements in natural language processing, particularly with large
language models (LLMs), are transforming how scientists engage with the
literature. While the adoption of LLMs is increasing, concerns remain regarding
potential information biases and computational costs. Rather than LLMs, I
developed a framework to evaluate the feasibility of precise, rapid, and
cost-effective information retrieval from extensive geoscience literature using
freely available small language models (MiniLMs). A curated corpus of
approximately 77 million high-quality sentences, extracted from 95 leading
peer-reviewed geoscience journals such as Geophysical Research Letters and
Earth and Planetary Science Letters published during years 2000 to 2024, was
constructed. MiniLMs enable a computationally efficient approach for extracting
relevant domain-specific information from these corpora through semantic search
techniques and sentence-level indexing. This approach, unlike LLMs such as
ChatGPT-4 that often produces generalized responses, excels at identifying
substantial amounts of expert-verified information with established,
multi-disciplinary sources, especially for information with quantitative
findings. Furthermore, by analyzing emotional tone via sentiment analysis and
topical clusters through unsupervised clustering within sentences, MiniLM
provides a powerful tool for tracking the evolution of conclusions, research
priorities, advancements, and emerging questions within geoscience communities.
Overall, MiniLM holds significant potential within the geoscience community for
applications such as fact and image retrievals, trend analyses, contradiction
analyses, and educational purposes.

### [3] [When Models Can't Follow: Testing Instruction Adherence Across 256 LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18892)
*Richard J. Young,Brandon Gillins,Alice M. Matthews*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个简化的评估框架，使用20个精心设计的提示来评估LLM在多样化任务类别中的指令遵循能力，通过大规模实证研究测试了256个模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有基准可能被模型记忆，需要新的评估方法来真实评估LLM的指令遵循能力，而非记忆性能。

Method: 开发紧凑测试套件，包含20个针对不同指令遵循方面的提示（格式合规、内容约束、逻辑排序、多步骤任务执行），在256个验证可工作的模型上进行测试。

Result: 识别了一致的失败模式，发现了特定指令类型带来的挑战，提供了跨主要LLM提供商的比较性能分析。

Conclusion: 该工作贡献了一个实用的评估工具，并对当代LLM的指令遵循能力进行了最全面的实证分析之一。

Abstract: Despite widespread deployment of Large Language Models, systematic evaluation
of instruction-following capabilities remains challenging. While comprehensive
benchmarks exist, focused assessments that quickly diagnose specific
instruction adherence patterns are valuable. As newer models may be trained on
existing benchmarks, novel evaluation approaches are needed to assess genuine
capabilities rather than memorized performance. This paper presents a
streamlined evaluation framework using twenty carefully designed prompts to
assess LLM instruction-following across diverse task categories. We demonstrate
this framework through a large-scale empirical study conducted on October 14,
2025, testing 256 verified working models from 331 available via OpenRouter. To
ensure methodological rigor and prevent selection bias, we first verified each
model's basic functionality before inclusion. Unlike large-scale benchmarks
requiring extensive computational resources, our approach offers a practical
diagnostic tool researchers and practitioners can readily apply. Our
methodology builds upon verifiable instructions while introducing a compact
test suite balancing comprehensiveness with efficiency. Each prompt targets
distinct aspects of instruction following, including format compliance, content
constraints, logical sequencing, and multi-step task execution. We evaluate
models from major providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, Mistral) and
emerging implementations (Qwen, DeepSeek, community models), providing
comparative performance analysis. Our findings reveal consistent failure modes
and identify specific instruction types posing particular challenges. This work
contributes both a practical evaluation tool and one of the most comprehensive
empirical analyses of instruction-following capabilities across the
contemporary LLM landscape.

### [4] [Transformer-Based Low-Resource Language Translation: A Study on Standard Bengali to Sylheti](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18898)
*Mangsura Kabir Oni,Tabia Tanzin Prama*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了孟加拉语到锡尔赫特语的机器翻译，通过微调多语言Transformer模型并与零样本大语言模型进行比较，发现微调模型显著优于LLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然机器翻译在高资源语言上取得了显著进展，但低资源语言如锡尔赫特语仍未被充分探索，需要研究如何为这些语言开发有效的翻译技术。

Method: 通过微调多语言Transformer模型（如mBART-50和MarianMT），并与零样本大语言模型进行比较，评估孟加拉语到锡尔赫特语的翻译性能。

Result: 实验结果显示微调模型显著优于大语言模型，其中mBART-50在翻译充分性方面表现最佳，MarianMT在字符级保真度方面最强。

Conclusion: 研究强调了针对代表性不足语言进行任务特定适应的重要性，为构建包容性语言技术做出了贡献。

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) has advanced from rule-based and statistical methods
to neural approaches based on the Transformer architecture. While these methods
have achieved impressive results for high-resource languages, low-resource
varieties such as Sylheti remain underexplored. In this work, we investigate
Bengali-to-Sylheti translation by fine-tuning multilingual Transformer models
and comparing them with zero-shot large language models (LLMs). Experimental
results demonstrate that fine-tuned models significantly outperform LLMs, with
mBART-50 achieving the highest translation adequacy and MarianMT showing the
strongest character-level fidelity. These findings highlight the importance of
task-specific adaptation for underrepresented languages and contribute to
ongoing efforts toward inclusive language technologies.

### [5] [DuoLens: A Framework for Robust Detection of Machine-Generated Multilingual Text and Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18904)
*Shriyansh Agrawal,Aidan Lau,Sanyam Shah,Ahan M R,Kevin Zhu,Sunishchal Dev,Vasu Sharma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过微调RoBERTa和CodeBERTa等小型语言模型，在机器生成内容检测任务中实现了比大型语言模型更好的性能，同时大幅降低了计算成本和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于零样本方法的机器生成内容检测器（如Fast DetectGPT、GPTZero）存在计算成本高或准确率不足的问题，需要在准确性和效率之间权衡，亟需改进方案。

Method: 微调预训练的编码器专用小型语言模型（RoBERTa和CodeBERTa），使用专门的源代码和自然语言数据集进行二元分类任务训练。

Result: 模型在AUROC指标上达到0.97-0.99，宏F1分数达到0.89-0.94，同时将延迟降低8-12倍，峰值VRAM使用减少3-5倍。在跨生成器迁移和对抗性变换下，性能保持原始AUROC的92%以上。

Conclusion: 小型语言模型在机器生成内容检测任务中显著优于大型语言模型，在保持高性能的同时大幅降低了计算资源需求，为实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The prevalence of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating multilingual
text and source code has only increased the imperative for machine-generated
content detectors to be accurate and efficient across domains. Current
detectors, predominantly utilizing zero-shot methods, such as Fast DetectGPT or
GPTZero, either incur high computational cost or lack sufficient accuracy,
often with a trade-off between the two, leaving room for further improvement.
To address these gaps, we propose the fine-tuning of encoder-only Small
Language Models (SLMs), in particular, the pre-trained models of RoBERTA and
CodeBERTa using specialized datasets on source code and other natural language
to prove that for the task of binary classification, SLMs outperform LLMs by a
huge margin whilst using a fraction of compute. Our encoders achieve AUROC $=
0.97$ to $0.99$ and macro-F1 $0.89$ to $0.94$ while reducing latency by
$8$-$12\times$ and peak VRAM by $3$-$5\times$ at $512$-token inputs. Under
cross-generator shifts and adversarial transformations (paraphrase,
back-translation; code formatting/renaming), performance retains $\geq 92%$ of
clean AUROC. We release training and evaluation scripts with seeds and configs;
a reproducibility checklist is also included.

### [6] [Improving Topic Modeling of Social Media Short Texts with Rephrasing: A Case Study of COVID-19 Related Tweets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18908)
*Wangjiaxuan Xin,Shuhua Yin,Shi Chen,Yaorong Ge*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TM-Rephrase是一个模型无关框架，使用大语言模型将原始推文重述为更标准化的语言，以提高主题建模在社交媒体短文本分析中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体短文本（如推文）的简洁性、非正式性和噪声限制了传统主题建模的效果，导致主题不连贯、冗余且难以解释。

Method: 开发了TM-Rephrase框架，采用两种重述策略（通用重述和口语到正式重述），在25,027条COVID-19相关推文数据集上测试多种主题建模方法。

Result: TM-Rephrase提高了主题连贯性、独特性和多样性三个指标，减少了大多数主题建模算法的主题冗余，其中口语到正式重述策略效果最佳，特别是对LDA算法。

Conclusion: 该研究为公共卫生相关社交媒体分析提供了一种模型无关的方法来增强主题建模，对改善健康危机及其他重要领域中公共话语的理解具有广泛意义。

Abstract: Social media platforms such as Twitter (now X) provide rich data for
analyzing public discourse, especially during crises such as the COVID-19
pandemic. However, the brevity, informality, and noise of social media short
texts often hinder the effectiveness of traditional topic modeling, producing
incoherent or redundant topics that are often difficult to interpret. To
address these challenges, we have developed \emph{TM-Rephrase}, a
model-agnostic framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to
rephrase raw tweets into more standardized and formal language prior to topic
modeling. Using a dataset of 25,027 COVID-19-related Twitter posts, we
investigate the effects of two rephrasing strategies, general- and
colloquial-to-formal-rephrasing, on multiple topic modeling methods. Results
demonstrate that \emph{TM-Rephrase} improves three metrics measuring topic
modeling performance (i.e., topic coherence, topic uniqueness, and topic
diversity) while reducing topic redundancy of most topic modeling algorithms,
with the colloquial-to-formal strategy yielding the greatest performance gains
and especially for the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm. This study
contributes to a model-agnostic approach to enhancing topic modeling in public
health related social media analysis, with broad implications for improved
understanding of public discourse in health crisis as well as other important
domains.

### [7] [Learning from the Best, Differently: A Diversity-Driven Rethinking on Data Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18909)
*Hongyi He,Xiao Liu,Zhenghao Lin,Mingni Tang,Yi Cheng,Jintao Wang,Wenjie Li,Peng Cheng,Yeyun Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了ODiS算法，通过主成分分析将多维度评分解耦为正交特征维度，从每个维度直接选择高分数据，确保预训练数据的质量和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于分数选择的方法会压缩相关维度，导致高分数据看似质量高但缺乏多样性，造成数据集分数与下游性能之间的非单调关系。

Method: 1. 从语言质量、知识质量、理解难度等多维度评估数据；2. 使用PCA解耦相关评分得到正交维度；3. 训练Roberta评分器回归PCA投影分数；4. 从每个正交维度选择高分数据构建训练集。

Result: ODiS选择的数据维度间重叠小于2%，证实了维度的正交性。使用ODiS数据训练的模型在下游基准测试中显著优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: 正交、多样性感知的数据选择对LLM预训练至关重要，ODiS算法能有效平衡数据质量和多样性。

Abstract: High-quality pre-training data is crutial for large language models, where
quality captures factual reliability and semantic value, and diversity ensures
broad coverage and distributional heterogeneity. Existing approaches typically
rely on single or multiple-dimensional score-based selection. However, directly
selecting top-scored data often degrades performance, and sampling from a
broader range is required to recover results. The above non-monotonicity
between dataset scores and downstream benchmark results reveals a fundamental
bias: score-based methods collapse correlated dimensions, causing top-scored
data to appear high-quality while systematically overlooking diversity. We
argue that ensuring diversity requires decomposing correlated metrics into
orthogonal feature dimensions, from which the top-scored data can be directly
selected. Therefore, we proposed the Orthogonal Diversity-Aware Selection
(ODiS) algorithm, which preserves both quality and diversity during data
selection. First, ODiS evaluates data from multiple dimensions, covering
language quality, knowledge quality, and comprehension difficulty. The
multi-dimensional scores are then decorrelated via Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), yielding orthogonal evaluation dimensions. For each dimension, a
Roberta-based scorer is trained to regress the data onto PCA-projected scores,
enabling scalable inference on large corpora. Finally, ODiS constructs the
training dataset by selecting top-scored data within each orthogonal dimension,
thereby ensuring both quality and diversity. Empirical results show that
ODiS-selected data exhibit less than 2\% inter-dimension overlap, confirming
orthogonality between dimensions. More importantly, models trained with
ODiS-selected data significantly outperform other baselines on downstream
benchmarks, highlighting the necessity of orthogonal, diversity-aware data
selection for LLMs.

### [8] [Context-aware Fairness Evaluation and Mitigation in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18914)
*Afrozah Nadeem,Mark Dras,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态可逆的剪枝框架，通过检测上下文感知的神经元激活并应用自适应掩码来调节生成过程中的影响，实现推理时的细粒度偏见缓解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型内部表示中嵌入的不良行为会破坏公平性、导致不一致性漂移、放大有害内容，并在对话中传播不良模式。现有方法计算成本高、不可逆且难以适应新对话上下文。

Method: 采用动态可逆的剪枝方法，检测上下文感知的神经元激活，应用自适应掩码来调节生成过程中的影响，实现推理时的细粒度控制。

Result: 该方法在多语言单轮和多轮对话中实现了知识保留和更一致的行为，支持动态公平控制。

Conclusion: 提出的推理时解决方案为现实世界对话AI提供了灵活、透明的偏见缓解方法，能够适应变化的对话上下文。

Abstract: Large language models often display undesirable behaviors embedded in their
internal representations, undermining fairness, inconsistency drift,
amplification of harmful content, and the propagation of unwanted patterns
during extended dialogue and conversations. Although training-time or
data-centric methods attempt to reduce these effects, they are computationally
expensive, irreversible once deployed, and slow to adapt to new conversational
contexts. Pruning-based methods provide a flexible and transparent way to
reduce bias by adjusting the neurons responsible for certain behaviors.
However, most existing approaches are static; once a neuron is removed, the
model loses the ability to adapt when the conversation or context changes. To
address this, we propose a dynamic, reversible, pruning-based framework that
detects context-aware neuron activations and applies adaptive masking to
modulate their influence during generation. Our inference-time solution
provides fine-grained, memory-aware mitigation with knowledge-preserved, more
coherent behavior across multilingual single- and multi-turn dialogues,
enabling dynamic fairness control in real-world conversational AI.

### [9] [MMAO-Bench: MultiModal All in One Benchmark Reveals Compositional Law between Uni-modal and Omni-modal in OmniModels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18915)
*Chen Chen,ZeYang Hu,Fengjiao Chen,Liya Ma,Jiaxing Liu,Xiaoyu Li,Xuezhi Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个新颖的多模态基准测试MMAO-Bench，用于评估单模态和全模态理解能力，包含1880个人工标注样本和44种任务类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型正从单模态理解向统一视觉、音频和语言模态的全模态模型发展，但单模态与全模态之间的相关性尚不明确，需要全面评估来推动全模态模型的智能进化。

Method: 开发了高质量、多样化的全模态基准测试MMAO-Bench，包含1880个人工标注样本、44种任务类型，并引入了创新的多步骤开放式问题类型来更好评估复杂推理任务。

Result: 实验结果显示跨模态和单模态性能之间存在组合规律，全模态能力在弱模型上表现为瓶颈效应，而在强模型上表现出协同促进作用。

Conclusion: MMAO-Bench基准测试有效揭示了全模态模型的能力特征，为多模态模型的评估和发展提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Languages models have been progressing from uni-modal
understanding toward unifying visual, audio and language modalities,
collectively termed omni models. However, the correlation between uni-modal and
omni-modal remains unclear, which requires comprehensive evaluation to drive
omni model's intelligence evolution. In this work, we propose a novel, high
quality and diversity omni model benchmark, MultiModal All in One Benchmark
(MMAO-Bench), which effectively assesses both uni-modal and omni-modal
understanding capabilities. The benchmark consists of 1880 human curated
samples, across 44 task types, and a innovative multi-step open-ended question
type that better assess complex reasoning tasks. Experimental result shows the
compositional law between cross-modal and uni-modal performance and the
omni-modal capability manifests as a bottleneck effect on weak models, while
exhibiting synergistic promotion on strong models.

### [10] [Misinformation Detection using Large Language Models with Explainability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18918)
*Jainee Patel,Chintan Bhatt,Himani Trivedi,Thanh Thi Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于transformer预训练语言模型的可解释性假新闻检测流程，通过两阶段微调策略优化RoBERTa和DistilBERT，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线平台虚假信息的快速传播破坏信任并阻碍知情决策，需要高效且可解释的检测方法。

Method: 使用两阶段微调策略：先冻结主干网络训练分类头，再逐步解冻主干层并应用分层学习率衰减。集成LIME和SHAP提供局部和全局解释。

Result: 在COVID Fake News和FakeNewsNet GossipCop数据集上，DistilBERT达到与RoBERTa相当的准确率，同时显著减少计算资源需求。

Conclusion: 预训练语言模型结合原则性微调和可解释性技术，可构建可扩展、可信赖的虚假信息检测框架。

Abstract: The rapid spread of misinformation on online platforms undermines trust among
individuals and hinders informed decision making. This paper shows an
explainable and computationally efficient pipeline to detect misinformation
using transformer-based pretrained language models (PLMs). We optimize both
RoBERTa and DistilBERT using a two-step strategy: first, we freeze the backbone
and train only the classification head; then, we progressively unfreeze the
backbone layers while applying layer-wise learning rate decay. On two
real-world benchmark datasets, COVID Fake News and FakeNewsNet GossipCop, we
test the proposed approach with a unified protocol of preprocessing and
stratified splits. To ensure transparency, we integrate the Local Interpretable
Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) at the token level to present token-level
rationales and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) at the global feature
attribution level. It demonstrates that DistilBERT achieves accuracy comparable
to RoBERTa while requiring significantly less computational resources. This
work makes two key contributions: (1) it quantitatively shows that a
lightweight PLM can maintain task performance while substantially reducing
computational cost, and (2) it presents an explainable pipeline that retrieves
faithful local and global justifications without compromising performance. The
results suggest that PLMs combined with principled fine-tuning and
interpretability can be an effective framework for scalable, trustworthy
misinformation detection.

### [11] [Evaluating LLM Story Generation through Large-scale Network Analysis of Social Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18932)
*Hiroshi Nonaka,K. E. Perry*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过分析叙事中的符号化角色网络来评估LLM故事生成能力的新方法，基于1200多个故事的网络分析发现LLM生成的故事普遍存在紧密、积极关系的偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在复杂任务中的创造力通常需要难以扩展的人工评估，需要开发可扩展的评估方法。

Method: 通过分析叙事中的符号化角色网络（包含密度、聚类和符号化边权重等网络属性），对四个领先LLM生成的1200多个故事进行大规模比较分析。

Result: LLM生成的故事一致表现出对紧密、积极关系的强烈偏见，这与之前使用人工评估的研究发现一致。

Conclusion: 该方法为评估当前和未来LLM在创意讲故事方面的局限性和倾向提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Evaluating the creative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in
complex tasks often requires human assessments that are difficult to scale. We
introduce a novel, scalable methodology for evaluating LLM story generation by
analyzing underlying social structures in narratives as signed character
networks. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we conduct a large-scale
comparative analysis using networks from over 1,200 stories, generated by four
leading LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Gemini 1.5 Flash) and a
human-written corpus. Our findings, based on network properties like density,
clustering, and signed edge weights, show that LLM-generated stories
consistently exhibit a strong bias toward tightly-knit, positive relationships,
which aligns with findings from prior research using human assessment. Our
proposed approach provides a valuable tool for evaluating limitations and
tendencies in the creative storytelling of current and future LLMs.

*Howard Yen,Ashwin Paranjape,Mengzhou Xia,Thejas Venkatesh,Jack Hessel,Danqi Chen,Yuhao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLIM是一个轻量级信息管理框架，通过分离搜索和浏览工具并定期总结轨迹，解决了长轨迹代理搜索中的上下文限制问题，在保持性能的同时显著降低了成本和工具调用次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的代理搜索框架在长轨迹任务中面临上下文限制问题，包括积累过多噪声内容、超出上下文窗口和工具预算、过早停止等，无法有效扩展到长轨迹搜索。

Method: SLIM框架将检索分为独立的搜索和浏览工具，并定期对搜索轨迹进行总结，保持上下文简洁的同时支持更长、更专注的搜索。

Result: 在长视野任务中，SLIM以显著更低的成本和更少的工具调用实现了与强开源基线相当的性能。使用o3作为基础模型时，SLIM在BrowseComp上达到56%，在HLE上达到31%，分别比所有开源框架高出8和4个绝对百分点，同时工具调用次数减少4-6倍。

Conclusion: SLIM框架通过简单的工具设计和信息管理策略，有效解决了长轨迹代理搜索的扩展性问题，同时减少了幻觉现象，为未来长视野代理系统提供了有价值的参考。

Abstract: Long-horizon agentic search requires iteratively exploring the web over long
trajectories and synthesizing information across many sources, and is the
foundation for enabling powerful applications like deep research systems. In
this work, we show that popular agentic search frameworks struggle to scale to
long trajectories primarily due to context limitations-they accumulate long,
noisy content, hit context window and tool budgets, or stop early. Then, we
introduce SLIM (Simple Lightweight Information Management), a simple framework
that separates retrieval into distinct search and browse tools, and
periodically summarizes the trajectory, keeping context concise while enabling
longer, more focused searches. On long-horizon tasks, SLIM achieves comparable
performance at substantially lower cost and with far fewer tool calls than
strong open-source baselines across multiple base models. Specifically, with o3
as the base model, SLIM achieves 56% on BrowseComp and 31% on HLE,
outperforming all open-source frameworks by 8 and 4 absolute points,
respectively, while incurring 4-6x fewer tool calls. Finally, we release an
automated fine-grained trajectory analysis pipeline and error taxonomy for
characterizing long-horizon agentic search frameworks; SLIM exhibits fewer
hallucinations than prior systems. We hope our analysis framework and simple
tool design inform future long-horizon agents.

*Zhilin Wang,Jaehun Jung,Ximing Lu,Shizhe Diao,Ellie Evans,Jiaqi Zeng,Pavlo Molchanov,Yejin Choi,Jan Kautz,Yi Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProfBench是一个包含7000多个专家评估响应的基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在专业文档处理、信息综合和报告生成方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型评估主要局限于数学、编程等易于验证的任务，而现实应用需要评估模型处理专业文档和生成综合报告的能力。

Method: 构建了ProfBench基准，包含物理学博士、化学博士、金融MBA和咨询MBA等专业领域的专家评估响应对，并开发了经济高效的LLM-Judge评估方法。

Result: ProfBench对最先进的大语言模型构成显著挑战，表现最佳的GPT-5-high模型仅达到65.9%的整体性能，且发现专有模型与开源模型之间存在明显性能差距。

Conclusion: ProfBench为专业领域的大语言模型评估提供了公平可访问的基准，揭示了扩展思维在处理复杂专业任务中的重要作用。

Abstract: Evaluating progress in large language models (LLMs) is often constrained by
the challenge of verifying responses, limiting assessments to tasks like
mathematics, programming, and short-form question-answering. However, many
real-world applications require evaluating LLMs in processing professional
documents, synthesizing information, and generating comprehensive reports in
response to user queries. We introduce ProfBench: a set of over 7000
response-criterion pairs as evaluated by human-experts with professional
knowledge across Physics PhD, Chemistry PhD, Finance MBA and Consulting MBA. We
build robust and affordable LLM-Judges to evaluate ProfBench rubrics, by
mitigating self-enhancement bias and reducing the cost of evaluation by 2-3
orders of magnitude, to make it fair and accessible to the broader community.
Our findings reveal that ProfBench poses significant challenges even for
state-of-the-art LLMs, with top-performing models like GPT-5-high achieving
only 65.9\% overall performance. Furthermore, we identify notable performance
disparities between proprietary and open-weight models and provide insights
into the role that extended thinking plays in addressing complex,
professional-domain tasks. Data:

### [14] [Dynamic Evaluation for Oversensitivity in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19005)
*Sophia Xiao Pu,Sitao Cheng,Xin Eric Wang,William Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发了一个动态生成模型特定挑战性数据集的框架，构建了OVERBENCH基准，包含来自25个模型的45万个样本，用于持续监测语言模型的过度敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准依赖静态数据集，随着模型演进会退化，导致数据污染和评估能力下降。过度敏感性会防御性地拒绝实际上良性的提示，破坏用户交互并模糊有害与无害内容的界限。

Method: 开发动态生成模型特定挑战性数据集的框架，捕捉新兴防御模式并与每个模型的独特行为对齐。基于此构建OVERBENCH基准，聚合不同LLM家族的数据集。

Result: 构建了OVERBENCH基准，包含来自25个模型的45万个样本，提供了对过度敏感性的动态和演进视角。

Conclusion: OVERBENCH允许随着模型发展持续监测防御性触发因素，突出静态数据集忽略的漏洞，为解决语言模型过度敏感性提供了更好的评估工具。

Abstract: Oversensitivity occurs when language models defensively reject prompts that
are actually benign. This behavior not only disrupts user interactions but also
obscures the boundary between harmful and harmless content. Existing benchmarks
rely on static datasets that degrade overtime as models evolve, leading to data
contamination and diminished evaluative power. To address this, we develop a
framework that dynamically generates model-specific challenging datasets,
capturing emerging defensive patterns and aligning with each model's unique
behavior. Building on this approach, we construct OVERBENCH, a benchmark that
aggregates these datasets across diverse LLM families, encompassing 450,000
samples from 25 models. OVERBENCH provides a dynamic and evolving perspective
on oversensitivity, allowing for continuous monitoring of defensive triggers as

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了SCRIPTS数据集，用于评估LLMs在人际语境中的社会推理能力，发现当前模型在英语和韩语上的表现存在显著差距，且存在选择不太可能关系的倾向，思维模型和链式思维提示对社会推理帮助有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在人类-AI交互中的广泛应用，其在人际语境中的社会推理能力变得至关重要。

Method: 构建了包含1,000个英语和韩语对话的SCRIPTS数据集，源自电影剧本，由母语者标注概率关系标签，评估了九个模型的社会推理能力。

Result: 专有LLMs在英语数据集上达到75-80%准确率，但在韩语上降至58-69%；模型在10-25%的回答中选择不太可能的关系；思维模型和链式思维提示对社会推理帮助有限，有时会放大社会偏见。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs的社会推理能力存在显著局限，需要开发更具社会意识的语言模型。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in human-AI
interactions, their social reasoning capabilities in interpersonal contexts are
critical. We introduce SCRIPTS, a 1k-dialogue dataset in English and Korean,
sourced from movie scripts. The task involves evaluating models' social
reasoning capability to infer the interpersonal relationships (e.g., friends,
sisters, lovers) between speakers in each dialogue. Each dialogue is annotated
with probabilistic relational labels (Highly Likely, Less Likely, Unlikely) by
native (or equivalent) Korean and English speakers from Korea and the U.S.
Evaluating nine models on our task, current proprietary LLMs achieve around
75-80% on the English dataset, whereas their performance on Korean drops to
58-69%. More strikingly, models select Unlikely relationships in 10-25% of
their responses. Furthermore, we find that thinking models and chain-of-thought
prompting, effective for general reasoning, provide minimal benefits for social
reasoning and occasionally amplify social biases. Our findings reveal
significant limitations in current LLMs' social reasoning capabilities,
highlighting the need for efforts to develop socially-aware language models.

TL;DR: 提出了两个用于评估心理健康支持LLM的基准：MentalBench-100k包含10万对响应，MentalAlign-70k比较LLM与人类专家在7个属性上的7万次评分，使用情感认知一致性框架量化一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心理健康支持LLM评估基准规模小、可靠性差，依赖合成或社交媒体数据，缺乏评估自动评判器可信度的框架。

Method: 构建MentalBench-100k数据集（10万对响应）和MentalAlign-70k基准（7万次评分），使用情感认知一致性框架通过组内相关系数量化LLM评判器与人类专家的一致性和偏差。

Result: 发现LLM评判器存在系统性高估，认知属性（指导性、信息性）可靠性强，同理心精度降低，安全性和相关性存在不可靠性。

Conclusion: 为心理健康领域LLM的可靠、大规模评估建立了新的方法论和实证基础。

Abstract: Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) for mental health support is
challenging due to the emotionally and cognitively complex nature of
therapeutic dialogue. Existing benchmarks are limited in scale, reliability,
often relying on synthetic or social media data, and lack frameworks to assess
when automated judges can be trusted. To address the need for large-scale
dialogue datasets and judge reliability assessment, we introduce two benchmarks
that provide a framework for generation and evaluation. MentalBench-100k
consolidates 10,000 one-turn conversations from three real scenarios datasets,
each paired with nine LLM-generated responses, yielding 100,000 response pairs.
MentalAlign-70k}reframes evaluation by comparing four high-performing LLM
judges with human experts across 70,000 ratings on seven attributes, grouped
into Cognitive Support Score (CSS) and Affective Resonance Score (ARS). We then
employ the Affective Cognitive Agreement Framework, a statistical methodology
using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) with confidence intervals to
quantify agreement, consistency, and bias between LLM judges and human experts.
Our analysis reveals systematic inflation by LLM judges, strong reliability for
cognitive attributes such as guidance and informativeness, reduced precision
for empathy, and some unreliability in safety and relevance. Our contributions
establish new methodological and empirical foundations for reliable,
large-scale evaluation of LLMs in mental health. We release the benchmarks and
codes at: https://github.com/abeerbadawi/MentalBench/

*Suswitha Pericharla,Daniel B. Hier,Tayo Obafemi-Ajayi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估大型语言模型在生物医学术语标准化任务中的表现，发现微调效果取决于标识符的流行度和词汇化程度。基因符号因词汇化程度高而表现良好，而GO和HPO的任意标识符限制了模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学数据集成需要将自然语言术语映射到标准化标识符，这对语义互操作性至关重要。虽然大语言模型在此任务中显示出潜力，但在不同术语系统中的表现不一致，需要系统评估其记忆和泛化能力。

Method: 使用Llama 3.1 8B模型在多个生物医学本体上进行微调，评估记忆能力（训练术语表现）和泛化能力（验证术语表现），并分析嵌入空间中的语义对齐情况。

Result: GO映射显示出强大的记忆增益（术语到标识符准确率提高77%），而HPO改进最小。仅在基因-蛋白质映射中观察到泛化（13.9%增益）。GPT-4o在所有术语系统中均优于Llama变体。嵌入分析显示基因符号与蛋白质名称语义对齐紧密，但GO和HPO的术语与标识符对齐较弱。

Conclusion: 微调成功取决于两个相互作用因素：标识符流行度和词汇化程度。流行的标识符在预训练中更常见，增强了记忆能力；词汇化的标识符（如基因符号）支持语义泛化。GO和HPO的任意标识符将模型限制在机械学习中。

Abstract: Effective biomedical data integration depends on automated term
normalization, the mapping of natural language biomedical terms to standardized
identifiers. This linking of terms to identifiers is essential for semantic
interoperability. Large language models (LLMs) show promise for this task but
perform unevenly across terminologies. We evaluated both memorization
(training-term performance) and generalization (validation-term performance)
across multiple biomedical ontologies. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 8B revealed marked
differences by terminology. GO mappings showed strong memorization gains (up to
77% improvement in term-to-identifier accuracy), whereas HPO showed minimal
improvement. Generalization occurred only for protein-gene (GENE) mappings
(13.9% gain), while fine-tuning for HPO and GO yielded negligible transfer.
Baseline accuracy varied by model scale, with GPT-4o outperforming both Llama
variants for all terminologies. Embedding analyses showed tight semantic
alignment between gene symbols and protein names but weak alignment between
terms and identifiers for GO or HPO, consistent with limited lexicalization.
Fine-tuning success depended on two interacting factors: identifier popularity
and lexicalization. Popular identifiers were more likely encountered during
pretraining, enhancing memorization. Lexicalized identifiers, such as gene
symbols, enabled semantic generalization. By contrast, arbitrary identifiers in
GO and HPO constrained models to rote learning. These findings provide a
predictive framework for when fine-tuning enhances factual recall versus when
it fails due to sparse or non-lexicalized identifiers.

Motivation: 扩展知识冲突研究到代码生成领域，探索LLMs如何处理参数知识与提示信息的矛盾。

Method: 提出领域无关的知识冲突构建和解释框架，开发针对代码冲突的新评估方法和数据集，使用激活级引导技术。

Result: 大模型能编码知识冲突概念，检测准确率达80.65%；激活引导比随机基线提升12.6%成功率；效果取决于模型大小、任务领域和引导方向的平衡。

Conclusion: LLMs确实编码了知识冲突概念，激活引导是有效的干预方法，但需要仔细平衡多个因素才能获得最佳效果。

Abstract: This paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) behave when faced
with discrepancies between their parametric knowledge and conflicting
information contained in a prompt. Building on prior question-answering (QA)
research, we extend the investigation of knowledge conflicts to the realm of
code generation. We propose a domain-agnostic framework for constructing and
interpreting such conflicts, along with a novel evaluation method and dataset
tailored to code conflict scenarios. Our experiments indicate that sufficiently
large LLMs encode the notion of a knowledge conflict in their parameters,
enabling us to detect knowledge conflicts with up to \textbf{80.65\%} accuracy.
Building on these insights, we show that activation-level steering can achieve
up to a \textbf{12.6\%} improvement in steering success over a random baseline.
However, effectiveness depends critically on balancing model size, task domain,
and steering direction. The experiment code and data will be made publicly
available after acceptance.

*Valentin Noël*

TL;DR: 提出基于频谱分析的框架，将transformer层建模为注意力诱导的动态图，通过图信号处理定义诊断指标，用于检测大语言模型中的幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在事实推理和幻觉区分方面存在挑战，需要开发有效的检测方法来识别不同类型的幻觉。

Method: 将transformer层建模为动态图，使用图信号处理定义Dirichlet能量、频谱熵和高频能量比等诊断指标，分析注意力机制诱导的图结构。

Result: 发现事实陈述呈现一致的"能量山"行为，而不同类型的幻觉显示独特特征：逻辑矛盾导致频谱不稳定，语义错误保持稳定但连接性漂移，替换幻觉显示中等扰动。基于频谱特征的检测器准确率达到88.75%。

Conclusion: 频谱几何能够捕捉推理模式和错误行为，为检测大语言模型中的幻觉提供了有效框架。

Abstract: Large language models achieve impressive results but distinguishing factual
reasoning from hallucinations remains challenging. We propose a spectral
analysis framework that models transformer layers as dynamic graphs induced by
attention, with token embeddings as signals on these graphs. Through graph
signal processing, we define diagnostics including Dirichlet energy, spectral
entropy, and high-frequency energy ratios, with theoretical connections to
computational stability. Experiments across GPT architectures suggest universal
spectral patterns: factual statements exhibit consistent "energy mountain"
behavior with low-frequency convergence, while different hallucination types
show distinct signatures. Logical contradictions destabilize spectra with large
effect sizes ($g>1.0$), semantic errors remain stable but show connectivity
drift, and substitution hallucinations display intermediate perturbations. A
simple detector using spectral signatures achieves 88.75% accuracy versus 75%
for perplexity-based baselines, demonstrating practical utility. These findings
indicate that spectral geometry may capture reasoning patterns and error
behaviors, potentially offering a framework for hallucination detection in
large language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同transformer架构如何通过不同的连接模式实现相同的语言计算，以及训练重点如何在计算模式中留下可检测的印记。

Method: 使用图信号处理分析注意力诱导的token图，在20种语言和3个模型家族中跟踪代数连通性（Fiedler值）在语音转换下的变化，重点关注早期层（2-5层）。

Result: 发现清晰的架构特征：Phi-3-Mini在英语中显示早期层显著中断，而其他19种语言影响最小；Qwen2.5-7B显示对形态丰富语言的小幅分布式变化；LLaMA-3.2-1B显示系统但温和的响应。这些光谱特征与行为差异强相关。

Conclusion: 训练重点会留下可检测的计算印记，表现为在句法转换过程中可测量的连接模式。该方法可作为简单、无需训练的诊断工具，揭示架构偏见并支持模型可靠性分析。

Abstract: Different transformer architectures implement identical linguistic
computations via distinct connectivity patterns, yielding model imprinted
``computational fingerprints'' detectable through spectral analysis. Using
graph signal processing on attention induced token graphs, we track changes in
algebraic connectivity (Fiedler value, $\Delta\lambda_2$) under voice
alternation across 20 languages and three model families, with a prespecified
early window (layers 2--5). Our analysis uncovers clear architectural
signatures: Phi-3-Mini shows a dramatic English specific early layer disruption
($\overline{\Delta\lambda_2}_{[2,5]}\!\approx\!-0.446$) while effects in 19
other languages are minimal, consistent with public documentation that
positions the model primarily for English use. Qwen2.5-7B displays small,
distributed shifts that are largest for morphologically rich languages, and
LLaMA-3.2-1B exhibits systematic but muted responses. These spectral signatures
correlate strongly with behavioral differences (Phi-3: $r=-0.976$) and are
modulated by targeted attention head ablations, linking the effect to early
attention structure and confirming functional relevance. Taken together, the
findings are consistent with the view that training emphasis can leave
detectable computational imprints: specialized processing strategies that
manifest as measurable connectivity patterns during syntactic transformations.
Beyond voice alternation, the framework differentiates reasoning modes,
indicating utility as a simple, training free diagnostic for revealing
architectural biases and supporting model reliability analysis.

Abstract: Tibetan, one of the major low-resource languages in Asia, presents unique
linguistic and sociocultural characteristics that pose both challenges and
opportunities for AI research. Despite increasing interest in developing AI
systems for underrepresented languages, Tibetan has received limited attention
due to a lack of accessible data resources, standardized benchmarks, and
dedicated tools. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the current
state of Tibetan AI in the AI domain, covering textual and speech data
resources, NLP tasks, machine translation, speech recognition, and recent
developments in LLMs. We systematically categorize existing datasets and tools,
evaluate methods used across different tasks, and compare performance where
possible. We also identify persistent bottlenecks such as data sparsity,
orthographic variation, and the lack of unified evaluation metrics.
Additionally, we discuss the potential of cross-lingual transfer, multi-modal
learning, and community-driven resource creation. This survey aims to serve as
a foundational reference for future work on Tibetan AI research and encourages
collaborative efforts to build an inclusive and sustainable AI ecosystem for
low-resource languages.

Motivation: 随着互联网和人工智能的快速发展，科技公司需要高效识别高潜力候选人，而LLM在编码和推理任务中表现出色，因此研究LLM能否通过这些招聘评估具有重要意义。

Method: 使用最先进的LLM对广泛使用的专业评估问卷生成回答，然后评估其表现。

Result: 所有被评估的LLM都无法通过招聘评估，模型生成的答案与公司参考解决方案之间存在显著不一致。

Conclusion: 尽管LLM在编码和推理任务中表现出色，但它们目前无法通过科技公司的标准化招聘评估，表明这些模型在专业工程能力评估方面仍有局限。

Abstract: With the proliferation of the internet and the rapid advancement of
Artificial Intelligence, leading technology companies face an urgent annual
demand for a considerable number of software and algorithm engineers. To
efficiently and effectively identify high-potential candidates from thousands
of applicants, these firms have established a multi-stage selection process,
which crucially includes a standardized hiring evaluation designed to assess
job-specific competencies. Motivated by the demonstrated prowess of Large
Language Models (LLMs) in coding and reasoning tasks, this paper investigates a
critical question: Can LLMs successfully pass these hiring evaluations? To this
end, we conduct a comprehensive examination of a widely used professional
assessment questionnaire. We employ state-of-the-art LLMs to generate responses
and subsequently evaluate their performance. Contrary to any prior expectation
of LLMs being ideal engineers, our analysis reveals a significant inconsistency
between the model-generated answers and the company-referenced solutions. Our
empirical findings lead to a striking conclusion: All evaluated LLMs fails to
pass the hiring evaluation.

Motivation: 现有的多跳RAG方法存在效率低下问题，包括在每个步骤重新生成可预测的token序列和依赖随机停止，导致token使用过多和终止不稳定。

Method: 提出TSSS框架，包含：(1)基于模板的推理，缓存重复前缀并将子查询锚定到主问题；(2)基于检索器的终止器，当额外子查询重复时确定性停止推理。

Result: 在HotpotQA、2WikiMultiHop和MuSiQue数据集上，TSSS达到了最先进的准确率和在RAG-CoT方法中具有竞争性的效率。

Conclusion: TSSS通过分离结构化推理和终止控制，实现了更快的推理和更可靠的答案，特别适用于设备端推理等效率受限场景。

Abstract: Multi-hop retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising strategy for
complex reasoning, yet existing iterative prompting approaches remain
inefficient. They often regenerate predictable token sequences at every step
and rely on stochastic stopping, leading to excessive token usage and unstable
termination. We propose TSSS (Think Straight, Stop Smart), a structured
multi-hop RAG framework designed for efficiency. TSSS introduces (i) a
template-based reasoning that caches recurring prefixes and anchors sub-queries
to the main question, reducing token generation cost while promoting stable
reasoning, and (ii) a retriever-based terminator, which deterministically halts
reasoning once additional sub-queries collapse into repetition. This separation
of structured reasoning and termination control enables both faster inference
and more reliable answers. On HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHop, and MuSiQue, TSSS
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and competitive efficiency among RAG-CoT
approaches, highlighting its effectiveness in efficiency-constrained scenarios
such as on-device inference.

Method: 从AWS更新、Azure变更和WHO疾病爆发报告三个真实世界时间标记语料库构建基准，识别自然发生的知识演化，生成针对不同LLM知识截止日期的问题

Result: 在12个开源和闭源LLMs上进行评估，发现在evolveQA上相比静态知识问题性能显著下降达31%

Conclusion: evolveQA基准能有效评估LLMs处理时间演化知识的能力，揭示了现有模型在动态知识处理方面的局限性

Abstract: LLMs often fail to handle temporal knowledge conflicts--contradictions
arising when facts evolve over time within their training data. Existing
studies evaluate this phenomenon through benchmarks built on structured
knowledge bases like Wikidata, but they focus on widely-covered,
easily-memorized popular entities and lack the dynamic structure needed to
fairly evaluate LLMs with different knowledge cut-off dates. We introduce
evolveQA, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on temporally
evolving knowledge, constructed from 3 real-world, time-stamped corpora: AWS
updates, Azure changes, and WHO disease outbreak reports. Our framework
identifies naturally occurring knowledge evolution and generates questions with
gold answers tailored to different LLM knowledge cut-off dates. Through
extensive evaluation of 12 open and closed-source LLMs across 3 knowledge
probing formats, we demonstrate significant performance drops of up to 31% on
evolveQA compared to static knowledge questions.

Conclusion: 证明了不依赖LLM RAG的知识图谱问答系统的可行性，使用小型复述模型能够有效处理知识图谱检索结果，提供了一种替代传统RAG方法的轻量级解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a question answering system that operates exclusively on
a knowledge graph retrieval without relying on retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) with large language models (LLMs). Instead, a small paraphraser model is
used to paraphrase the entity relationship edges retrieved from querying the
knowledge graph. The proposed pipeline is divided into two main stages. The
first stage involves pre-processing a document to generate sets of
question-answer (QA) pairs. The second stage converts these QAs into a
knowledge graph from which graph-based retrieval is performed using embeddings
and fuzzy techniques. The graph is queried, re-ranked, and paraphrased to
generate a final answer. This work includes an evaluation using LLM-as-a-judge
on the CRAG benchmark, which resulted in accuracies of 71.9% and 54.4% using
LLAMA-3.2 and GPT-3.5-Turbo, respectively.

Abstract: Evaluating conversational AI systems that use external tools is challenging,
as errors can arise from complex interactions among user, agent, and tools.
While existing evaluation methods assess either user satisfaction or agents'
tool-calling capabilities, they fail to capture critical errors in multi-turn
tool-augmented dialogues-such as when agents misinterpret tool results yet
appear satisfactory to users. We introduce TRACE, a benchmark of systematically
synthesized tool-augmented conversations covering diverse error cases, and
SCOPE, an evaluation framework that automatically discovers diverse error
patterns and evaluation rubrics in tool-augmented dialogues. Experiments show
SCOPE significantly outperforms the baseline, particularly on challenging cases
where user satisfaction signals are misleading.

<details>

Motivation: 现有LLM路由系统采用集中式外部路由器，存在灵活性差、性能不佳的问题，因为小型路由器无法充分理解不同LLM的知识边界。

Method: 采用分布式路由设计，查询在网络中的LLM代理间传递，每个代理基于自我认知独立决定回答或路由。提出两阶段自我认知训练流程来增强LLM的自我意识。

Result: 实验表明DiSRouter在各种场景下显著优于现有路由方法，能有效区分简单和复杂查询，对域外任务表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 利用LLM内在自我认知比外部评估更有效，为更模块化和高效的多智能体系统开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created a diverse
ecosystem of models with highly varying performance and costs, necessitating
effective query routing to balance performance and expense. Current routing
systems often rely on a centralized external router trained on a fixed set of
LLMs, making them inflexible and prone to poor performance since the small
router can not fully understand the knowledge boundaries of different LLMs. We
introduce DiSRouter (Distributed Self-Router), a novel paradigm that shifts
from centralized control to distributed routing. In DiSRouter, a query
traverses a network of LLM agents, each independently deciding whether to
answer or route to other agents based on its own self-awareness, its ability to
judge its competence. This distributed design offers superior flexibility,
scalability, and generalizability. To enable this, we propose a two-stage
Self-Awareness Training pipeline that enhances each LLM's self-awareness.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiSRouter significantly outperforms
existing routing methods in utility across various scenarios, effectively
distinguishes between easy and hard queries, and shows strong generalization to
out-of-domain tasks. Our work validates that leveraging an LLM's intrinsic
self-awareness is more effective than external assessment, paving the way for
more modular and efficient multi-agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言知识库存在两个关键限制：一刀切的向量表示不适合语言数据的多样化结构，缺乏将多种信号聚合为单一综合得分的系统方法

Method: 为每种距离类型提出新颖的结构感知表示：地理距离使用说话者加权分布，谱系距离使用双曲嵌入，类型学距离使用潜变量模型，并将这些信号统一为稳健的任务无关复合距离

Result: 在跨语言迁移任务中，所提出的表示和复合距离在广泛的NLP任务上持续提升性能

Conclusion: 该框架为多语言研究提供了更系统和有效的工具包

Abstract: Existing linguistic knowledge bases such as URIEL+ provide valuable
geographic, genetic and typological distances for cross-lingual transfer but
suffer from two key limitations. One, their one-size-fits-all vector
representations are ill-suited to the diverse structures of linguistic data,
and two, they lack a principled method for aggregating these signals into a
single, comprehensive score. In this paper, we address these gaps by
introducing a framework for type-matched language distances. We propose novel,
structure-aware representations for each distance type: speaker-weighted
distributions for geography, hyperbolic embeddings for genealogy, and a latent
variables model for typology. We unify these signals into a robust,
task-agnostic composite distance. In selecting transfer languages, our
representations and composite distances consistently improve performance across
a wide range of NLP tasks, providing a more principled and effective toolkit
for multilingual research.

TL;DR: SheetBrain是一个神经符号双工作流代理框架，用于在表格数据上进行准确推理，支持电子表格问答和操作任务。它通过理解、执行和验证三个核心模块，显著提高了在复杂电子表格上的推理准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在理解和推理复杂电子表格方面存在困难，难以准确捕捉表格的复杂结构并确保推理正确性。

Method: SheetBrain包含三个核心模块：理解模块生成电子表格的全面概览；执行模块集成Python沙箱和Excel工具包进行多轮推理；验证模块验证推理和答案的正确性，必要时触发重新执行。

Result: 在多个公开表格问答和操作基准测试中，SheetBrain显著提高了准确性，特别是在新提出的SheetBench基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: SheetBrain通过神经符号双工作流框架有效解决了LLM在复杂电子表格推理中的挑战，为表格数据处理提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over complex spreadsheets remain fundamental
challenges for large language models (LLMs), which often struggle with
accurately capturing the complex structure of tables and ensuring reasoning
correctness. In this work, we propose SheetBrain, a neuro-symbolic dual
workflow agent framework designed for accurate reasoning over tabular data,
supporting both spreadsheet question answering and manipulation tasks.
SheetBrain comprises three core modules: an understanding module, which
produces a comprehensive overview of the spreadsheet - including sheet summary
and query-based problem insight to guide reasoning; an execution module, which
integrates a Python sandbox with preloaded table-processing libraries and an
Excel helper toolkit for effective multi-turn reasoning; and a validation
module, which verifies the correctness of reasoning and answers, triggering
re-execution when necessary. We evaluate SheetBrain on multiple public tabular
QA and manipulation benchmarks, and introduce SheetBench, a new benchmark
targeting large, multi-table, and structurally complex spreadsheets.
Experimental results show that SheetBrain significantly improves accuracy on
both existing benchmarks and the more challenging scenarios presented in
SheetBench. Our code is publicly available at

*Yuto Tomikawa,Masaki Uto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型和直接偏好优化技术的难度可控多项选择题生成方法，用于阅读理解任务，解决了传统方法无法直接生成选择题和难度控制精度不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统难度可控问题生成方法存在两个主要局限：无法直接生成教育场景中最常用的多项选择题类型，以及没有明确训练来优化难度控制的准确性。

Method: 利用大语言模型，采用直接偏好优化技术进行训练，以提高难度控制的准确性。

Result: 该方法能够直接生成难度可控的多项选择题，相比传统方法在难度控制精度上有显著提升。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了传统难度可控问题生成的两个主要局限，为自适应学习支持提供了更实用的工具。

Abstract: Difficulty-controllable question generation for reading comprehension has
gained significant attention in the field of education as a fundamental tool
for adaptive learning support. Although several neural question generation
methods have recently succeeded in controlling difficulty, conventional
approaches still face two major limitations. First, they cannot directly
generate multiple-choice questions, which are the most widely used question
type in educational contexts. Second, they are not explicitly trained to
optimize the accuracy of difficulty control, leaving room for further
improvement in difficulty controllability. To address these limitations, this
study proposes a novel difficulty-controllable multiple-choice question
generation method for reading comprehension which leverages a large language
model trained using a direct preference optimization technique to improve the
accuracy of difficulty control.

TL;DR: TheMCPCompany是一个用于评估工具调用代理的基准测试，通过REST API创建包含18,000多个工具的MCP服务器，研究代理在真实世界服务交互中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前通用代理主要依赖网络浏览器与环境交互，而MCP协议的出现使得任务专用工具集数量大幅增加，这些工具集比GUI更易开发和维护，但缺乏相应的评估基准。

Method: 使用各种真实世界服务的REST API创建MCP服务器，提供手动标注的地面真实工具，通过工具检索和地面真实工具两种方式评估代理性能。

Result: 使用地面真实工具时，工具调用代理在性能和成本方面都有提升；通过工具检索时，所有模型的性能都相似或优于基于浏览器的代理，但较小模型无法充分利用可用工具，而GPT-5的工具检索性能接近其地面真实工具性能。

Conclusion: 最先进的推理模型在简单环境中能有效发现工具，但在复杂企业环境中导航数万工具并以非平凡方式组合它们解决复杂问题仍具挑战性，需要更好的推理和检索模型。

Abstract: Since the introduction of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), the number of
available tools for Large Language Models (LLMs) has increased significantly.
These task-specific tool sets offer an alternative to general-purpose tools
such as web browsers, while being easier to develop and maintain than GUIs.
However, current general-purpose agents predominantly rely on web browsers for
interacting with the environment. Here, we introduce TheMCPCompany, a benchmark
for evaluating tool-calling agents on tasks that involve interacting with
various real-world services. We use the REST APIs of these services to create
MCP servers, which include over 18,000 tools. We also provide manually
annotated ground-truth tools for each task. In our experiments, we use the
ground truth tools to show the potential of tool-calling agents for both
improving performance and reducing costs assuming perfect tool retrieval. Next,
we explore agent performance using tool retrieval to study the real-world
practicality of tool-based agents. While all models with tool retrieval perform
similarly or better than browser-based agents, smaller models cannot take full
advantage of the available tools through retrieval. On the other hand, GPT-5's
performance with tool retrieval is very close to its performance with
ground-truth tools. Overall, our work shows that the most advanced reasoning
models are effective at discovering tools in simpler environments, but
seriously struggle with navigating complex enterprise environments.
TheMCPCompany reveals that navigating tens of thousands of tools and combining
them in non-trivial ways to solve complex problems is still a challenging task
for current models and requires both better reasoning and better retrieval
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: JointCQ是一个联合声明-查询生成框架，通过精心设计的评估标准筛选合成训练数据，微调语言模型进行联合声明提取和查询生成，在多个开放域QA幻觉检测基准测试中优于先前方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型存在幻觉问题，生成看似真实但不可靠的内容。现有幻觉检测方法在声明提取和查询生成阶段存在上下文丢失和低特异性等限制，导致整个检测流程性能下降。

Method: 提出JointCQ框架，设计评估标准筛选合成训练数据，微调语言模型进行联合声明提取和查询生成，为下游搜索和验证提供可靠且信息丰富的输入。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个开放域QA幻觉检测基准测试中优于先前方法。

Conclusion: JointCQ框架推进了更可信和透明语言模型系统的目标，通过改进声明提取和查询生成阶段提升了幻觉检测的整体性能。

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) often suffer from hallucination issues,
i,e, generating content that appears factual but is actually unreliable. A
typical hallucination detection pipeline involves response decomposition (i.e.,
claim extraction), query generation, evidence collection (i.e., search or
retrieval), and claim verification. However, existing methods exhibit
limitations in the first two stages, such as context loss during claim
extraction and low specificity in query generation, resulting in degraded
performance across the hallucination detection pipeline. In this work, we
introduce JointCQ https://github.com/pku0xff/JointCQ, a joint claim-and-query
generation framework designed to construct an effective and efficient
claim-query generator. Our framework leverages elaborately designed evaluation
criteria to filter synthesized training data, and finetunes a language model
for joint claim extraction and query generation, providing reliable and
informative inputs for downstream search and verification. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods on multiple
open-domain QA hallucination detection benchmarks, advancing the goal of more
trustworthy and transparent language model systems.

TL;DR: KORE是一种协同方法，通过知识导向的增强和约束，在大型多模态模型中注入新知识的同时保留旧知识，解决了知识适应和知识保留的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型的知识是静态的，无法跟上现实世界的发展，这阻碍了持续知识获取。现有方法在学习新知识时往往存在灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: KORE自动将单个知识项转换为结构化和全面的知识，确保模型准确学习新知识；同时将先前知识存储在LMM线性层激活的协方差矩阵中，并通过将原始权重投影到矩阵的零空间来初始化适配器，定义最小化与先前知识干扰的微调方向。

Result: 在LLaVA-v1.5-7B、LLaVA-v1.5-13B和Qwen2.5-VL-7B等多种LMM上的广泛实验表明，KORE实现了优越的新知识注入性能，并有效缓解了灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: KORE通过知识导向的增强和约束，成功解决了大型多模态模型的知识注入和保留问题，实现了准确的知识适应和强大的知识保留。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models encode extensive factual knowledge in their
pre-trained weights. However, its knowledge remains static and limited, unable
to keep pace with real-world developments, which hinders continuous knowledge
acquisition. Effective knowledge injection thus becomes critical, involving two
goals: knowledge adaptation (injecting new knowledge) and knowledge retention
(preserving old knowledge). Existing methods often struggle to learn new
knowledge and suffer from catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose
KORE, a synergistic method of KnOwledge-oRientEd augmentations and constraints
for injecting new knowledge into large multimodal models while preserving old
knowledge. Unlike general text or image data augmentation, KORE automatically
converts individual knowledge items into structured and comprehensive knowledge
to ensure that the model accurately learns new knowledge, enabling accurate
adaptation. Meanwhile, KORE stores previous knowledge in the covariance matrix
of LMM's linear layer activations and initializes the adapter by projecting the
original weights into the matrix's null space, defining a fine-tuning direction
that minimizes interference with previous knowledge, enabling powerful
retention. Extensive experiments on various LMMs, including LLaVA-v1.5-7B,
LLaVA-v1.5-13B, and Qwen2.5-VL-7B, show that KORE achieves superior new
knowledge injection performance and effectively mitigates catastrophic
forgetting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自然语言生成模型的广泛应用，模型产生看似合理但错误信息的幻觉问题日益严重，需要有效的检测方法。

Method: 提出包含11个类别的幻觉分类法，开发HAD模型集成检测、识别和修正功能，使用约90K合成样本训练，并构建HADTest测试集。

Result: 在HaluEval、FactCHD和FaithBench等基准测试中，HAD模型普遍优于现有基线，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: HAD模型展示了在多种NLG任务中的鲁棒性和通用性，为幻觉检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing reliance on natural language generation (NLG) models,
particularly large language models, has raised concerns about the reliability
and accuracy of their outputs. A key challenge is hallucination, where models
produce plausible but incorrect information. As a result, hallucination
detection has become a critical task. In this work, we introduce a
comprehensive hallucination taxonomy with 11 categories across various NLG
tasks and propose the HAllucination Detection (HAD) models
https://github.com/pku0xff/HAD, which integrate hallucination detection,
span-level identification, and correction into a single inference process.
Trained on an elaborate synthetic dataset of about 90K samples, our HAD models
are versatile and can be applied to various NLG tasks. We also carefully
annotate a test set for hallucination detection, called HADTest, which contains
2,248 samples. Evaluations on in-domain and out-of-domain test sets show that
our HAD models generally outperform the existing baselines, achieving
state-of-the-art results on HaluEval, FactCHD, and FaithBench, confirming their
robustness and versatility.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于超体积优化的多目标强化学习策略，用于优化文本摘要任务中的一致性、连贯性、相关性和流畅性等多个目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本摘要需要同时优化多个目标，但目前很少有研究关注基于大语言模型的多目标强化学习优化问题。

Method: 引入超体积优化(HVO)策略，在强化学习的奖励过程中使用超体积方法动态调整组间分数，引导模型逐步逼近帕累托前沿。

Result: 在多个代表性摘要数据集上的实验表明，该方法在总体得分上优于GRPO，在不同维度上表现出更平衡的性能。7B基础模型增强后性能与GPT-4相当，同时生成长度更短。

Conclusion: HVO方法能够有效优化文本摘要的多目标问题，生成平衡的摘要结果，且计算效率较高。

Abstract: Text summarization is a crucial task that requires the simultaneous
optimization of multiple objectives, including consistency, coherence,
relevance, and fluency, which presents considerable challenges. Although large
language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance, enhanced by
reinforcement learning (RL), few studies have focused on optimizing the
multi-objective problem of summarization through RL based on LLMs. In this
paper, we introduce hypervolume optimization (HVO), a novel optimization
strategy that dynamically adjusts the scores between groups during the reward
process in RL by using the hypervolume method. This method guides the model's
optimization to progressively approximate the pareto front, thereby generating
balanced summaries across multiple objectives. Experimental results on several
representative summarization datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
group relative policy optimization (GRPO) in overall scores and shows more
balanced performance across different dimensions. Moreover, a 7B foundation
model enhanced by HVO performs comparably to GPT-4 in the summarization task,
while maintaining a shorter generation length. Our code is publicly available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受推理LLMs发展的启发，希望将推理能力整合到语音LLMs中，以提升槽填充任务的性能。

Method: 使用思维链框架将槽填充任务分解为多个推理步骤，创建推理数据集，对语音LLM进行监督微调，区分常规和推理语音LLMs，并实验不同类型的文本基础模型。

Result: 引入推理步骤能提高性能，但主要用于数学、逻辑和编码领域的推理文本LLM作为基础模型可能表现较差；混合语音LLMs（基于混合文本基础LLM并保留直接和推理两种操作模式）比仅使用单一模式的模型性能更好。

Conclusion: 将推理能力整合到语音LLMs中能有效提升槽填充任务性能，混合操作模式的模型优于单一模式模型，但需要选择合适的基础文本模型。

Abstract: We propose integration of reasoning into speech large language models
(speechLLMs) for the end-to-end slot-filling task. Inspired by the recent
development of reasoning LLMs, we use a chain-of-thought framework to decompose
the slot-filling task into multiple reasoning steps, create a reasoning dataset
and apply the supervised fine-tuning strategy to a speechLLM. We distinguish
between regular and reasoning speechLLMs and experiment with different types
and sizes of LLMs as their text foundation models. We demonstrate performance
improvements by introducing reasoning (intermediate) steps. However, we show
that a reasoning textual LLM developed mainly for math, logic and coding
domains might be inferior as a foundation model for a reasoning speechLLM. We
further show that hybrid speechLLMs, built on a hybrid text foundation LLM and
fine-tuned to preserve both direct and reasoning modes of operation, have
better performance than those fine-tuned employing only one mode of operation.

Motivation: 将心理学关于群体身份的见解与先进NLP技术相结合，研究将社会人口属性融入LLMs是否能解决自动仇恨言论检测中的偏见问题。

Method: 使用Google的Gemini和OpenAI的GPT-4.1-mini模型，采用两种身份提示方法：浅层身份提示和基于检索增强生成（RAG）的深度情境化身份开发，以纳入更丰富的身份档案。分析使用内群体和外群体标注者身份对模型检测性能和公平性的影响。

Result: 研究结果突显了基于身份的方法在减少偏见方面的潜力和局限性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为开发更公平的仇恨言论检测系统提供了有价值的见解，展示了将社会人口属性融入LLMs可以解决自动仇恨言论检测中的偏见问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how personalising Large Language Models
(Persona-LLMs) with annotator personas affects their sensitivity to hate
speech, particularly regarding biases linked to shared or differing identities
between annotators and targets. To this end, we employ Google's Gemini and
OpenAI's GPT-4.1-mini models and two persona-prompting methods: shallow persona
prompting and a deeply contextualised persona development based on
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to incorporate richer persona profiles. We
analyse the impact of using in-group and out-group annotator personas on the
models' detection performance and fairness across diverse social groups. This
work bridges psychological insights on group identity with advanced NLP
techniques, demonstrating that incorporating socio-demographic attributes into
LLMs can address bias in automated hate speech detection. Our results highlight
both the potential and limitations of persona-based approaches in reducing
bias, offering valuable insights for developing more equitable hate speech
detection systems.

TL;DR: LOGICAL是一个基于微调GLiNER模型的本地化PII移除系统，在临床笔记中高效去除个人身份信息，性能优于大型语言模型，适合资源受限环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在临床笔记PII移除中的高计算成本和数据隐私风险，特别是在低资源环境下的应用限制。

Method: 使用微调的GLiNER模型，在1515份临床文档上定义9个PII类别，训练2849个文本实例，并与多个系统进行性能比较。

Result: 微调GLiNER模型达到0.980的F1分数，显著优于Gemini-Pro-2.5（0.845），95%的文档完全净化，在标准笔记本上高效运行。

Conclusion: 微调的专业化Transformer模型提供准确、计算高效且安全的PII移除解决方案，是资源密集型LLMs的实用替代方案。

Abstract: Removing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from clinical notes in
Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is essential for research and AI development.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful, their high computational costs
and the data privacy risks of API-based services limit their use, especially in
low-resource settings. To address this, we developed LOGICAL (Local Obfuscation
by GLINER for Impartial Context-Aware Lineage), an efficient, locally
deployable PII removal system built on a fine-tuned Generalist and Lightweight
Named Entity Recognition (GLiNER) model. We used 1515 clinical documents from a
psychiatric hospital's EHR system. We defined nine PII categories for removal.
A modern-gliner-bi-large-v1.0 model was fine-tuned on 2849 text instances and
evaluated on a test set of 376 instances using character-level precision,
recall, and F1-score. We compared its performance against Microsoft Azure NER,
Microsoft Presidio, and zero-shot prompting with Gemini-Pro-2.5 and
Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. The fine-tuned GLiNER model achieved superior
performance, with an overall micro-average F1-score of 0.980, significantly
outperforming Gemini-Pro-2.5 (F1-score: 0.845). LOGICAL correctly sanitised 95%
of documents completely, compared to 64% for the next-best solution. The model
operated efficiently on a standard laptop without a dedicated GPU. However, a
2% entity-level false negative rate underscores the need for human-in-the-loop
validation across all tested systems. Fine-tuned, specialised transformer
models like GLiNER offer an accurate, computationally efficient, and secure
solution for PII removal from clinical notes. This "sanitisation at the source"
approach is a practical alternative to resource-intensive LLMs, enabling the
creation of de-identified datasets for research and AI development while
preserving data privacy, particularly in resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: 研究多模态线索（如语音、手势和注视）在对话轮换管理中的作用，特别是手势作为补充线索的重要性。

Method: 扩展DnD Gesture语料库为DnD Gesture++，包含四种语义手势类型标注；使用混合专家框架整合文本、音频和手势特征进行轮换预测。

Result: 实验表明，加入语义引导的手势相比基线模型能带来持续的性能提升，证明手势在多模态轮换预测中的补充作用。

Conclusion: 语义手势在多模态对话轮换预测中具有重要的补充价值，DnD Gesture++数据集为相关研究提供了有力支持。

Abstract: In conversation, humans use multimodal cues, such as speech, gestures, and
gaze, to manage turn-taking. While linguistic and acoustic features are
informative, gestures provide complementary cues for modeling these
transitions. To study this, we introduce DnD Gesture++, an extension of the
multi-party DnD Gesture corpus enriched with 2,663 semantic gesture annotations
spanning iconic, metaphoric, deictic, and discourse types. Using this dataset,
we model turn-taking prediction through a Mixture-of-Experts framework
integrating text, audio, and gestures. Experiments show that incorporating
semantically guided gestures yields consistent performance gains over
baselines, demonstrating their complementary role in multimodal turn-taking.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: M3-SLU是一个新的多模态大语言模型基准，用于评估多说话人、多轮对话的口语理解能力，重点关注说话人归属推理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在语音和文本理解方面表现良好，但在自然对话中理解谁在何时说了什么的能力（说话人归属推理）仍然存在困难，需要专门的基准来评估和改进。

Method: 从四个开放语料库（CHiME-6、MELD、MultiDialog、AMI）构建，包含超过12,000个经过验证的实例，配有音频、转录文本和元数据。包含两个任务：说话人归属问答和基于话语匹配的说话人归属。

Result: 模型能够捕捉说了什么内容，但经常无法识别谁说的，揭示了说话人感知对话理解的关键差距。提供了级联流水线和端到端MLLM的基线结果。

Conclusion: M3-SLU作为一个具有挑战性的基准，可以推动说话人感知多模态理解的研究进展。

Abstract: We present M3-SLU, a new multimodal large language model (MLLM) benchmark for
evaluating multi-speaker, multi-turn spoken language understanding. While
recent models show strong performance in speech and text comprehension, they
still struggle with speaker-attributed reasoning, the ability to understand who
said what and when in natural conversations. M3-SLU is built from four open
corpora (CHiME-6, MELD, MultiDialog, and AMI) and comprises over 12,000
validated instances with paired audio, transcripts, and metadata. It includes
two tasks: (1) Speaker-Attributed Question Answering and (2) Speaker
Attribution via Utterance Matching. We provide baseline results for both
cascaded pipelines and end-to-end MLLMs, evaluated using an LLM-as-Judge and
accuracy metrics. Results show that while models can capture what was said,
they often fail to identify who said it, revealing a key gap in speaker-aware
dialogue understanding. M3-SLU offers as a challenging benchmark to advance
research in speaker-aware multimodal understanding.

TL;DR: AgenticMath是一个用于生成高质量数学问答对的智能代理流程，通过四阶段方法提升LLM的数学推理能力，相比大规模低质量数据，使用少量高质量数据即可达到竞争性或更优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在生成高质量数据集以改进LLM推理方面面临挑战，常产生低质量/错误答案且信息丰富度有限。

Method: 四阶段流程：1)种子问题筛选；2)多代理问题重述；3)答案增强；4)问答对评估。使用链式思维推理增强答案正确性，无需人工标注。

Result: 在3B-8B参数LLM上使用仅30-60K数学样本微调，在多种数学推理基准测试中表现优于使用400K或2.3M样本的基线方法。

Conclusion: 针对性的高质量数据生成比大规模低质量数据更有效地提升LLM的数学推理能力。

Abstract: The creation of high-quality datasets to improve Large Language Model (LLM)
reasoning remains a significant challenge, as current methods often suffer from
generating low-quality/incorrect answers and limited information richness from
available data sources. To address this, we propose AgenticMath, a novel
agentic pipeline for generating high-quality mathematical question-answer pairs
to enhance the supervised fine-tuning of LLMs. Our method operates through four
stages: (1) Seed Question Filter that selects questions with high information
richness, complexity, and clarity; (2) an Agentic Question Rephrase step that
employs a multi-agent system to generate diverse, logically consistent
paraphrases; (3) an Answer Augment step where rewrite answers using
chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance numerical and logical correctness,
without reliance on human-provided labels; and (4) a final Question and Answer
Evaluation that retains only the most superior pairs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that, fine-tuning 3B-8B parameter LLMs on AgenticMath generated
datasets (comprising only 30-60K math samples) achieves competitive or superior
performance on diverse in domain and out-of-domain mathematical reasoning
benchmarks compared to baselines trained on much more data (e.g., 400K or 2.3M
samples). Our work demonstrates that targeted, high-quality data generation is
a more efficient path to improving mathematical reasoning in LLMs than

### [43] [LoongRL:Reinforcement Learning for Advanced Reasoning over Long Contexts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19363)
*Siyuan Wang,Gaokai Zhang,Li Lyna Zhang,Ning Shang,Fan Yang,Dongyao Chen,Mao Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LoongRL是一种数据驱动的强化学习方法，通过KeyChain技术将短多跳QA转化为高难度长上下文任务，训练模型在16K长度下有效解决128K任务，显著提升长上下文推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文推理对大型语言模型至关重要，但现有强化学习方法主要针对短上下文，长上下文推理所需的高级思维模式尚未充分探索，且高难度强化学习数据稀缺。

Method: 提出LoongRL方法，核心是KeyChain合成技术：通过插入UUID链将短多跳QA转化为高难度长上下文任务，模型需要逐步追踪正确链、识别真实问题、检索相关事实并进行推理。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-7B和14B上，LoongRL将长上下文多跳QA准确率分别提升23.5%和21.1%。LoongRL-14B达到74.2分，媲美o3-mini(74.5)和DeepSeek-R1(74.9)等更大模型。同时提升长上下文检索能力，通过所有128K压力测试，并保持短上下文推理能力。

Conclusion: LoongRL通过数据驱动方法有效解决了长上下文推理的挑战，在16K长度训练下能泛化到128K任务，避免了昂贵的全长度强化学习成本，为长上下文推理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Reasoning over long contexts is essential for large language models. While
reinforcement learning (RL) enhances short-context reasoning by inducing "Aha"
moments in chain-of-thought, the advanced thinking patterns required for
long-context reasoning remain largely unexplored, and high-difficulty RL data
are scarce. In this paper, we introduce LoongRL, a data-driven RL method for
advanced long-context reasoning. Central to LoongRL is KeyChain, a synthesis
approach that transforms short multi-hop QA into high-difficulty long-context
tasks by inserting UUID chains that hide the true question among large
collections of distracting documents. Solving these tasks requires the model to
trace the correct chain step-by-step, identify the true question, retrieve
relevant facts and reason over them to answer correctly. RL training on
KeyChain data induces an emergent plan-retrieve-reason-recheck reasoning
pattern that generalizes far beyond training length. Models trained at 16K
effectively solve 128K tasks without prohibitive full-length RL rollout costs.
On Qwen2.5-7B and 14B, LoongRL substantially improves long-context multi-hop QA
accuracy by +23.5% and +21.1% absolute gains. The resulting LoongRL-14B reaches
a score of 74.2, rivaling much larger frontier models such as o3-mini (74.5)
and DeepSeek-R1 (74.9). It also improves long-context retrieval, passes all
128K needle-in-a-haystack stress tests, and preserves short-context reasoning
capabilities.

Abstract: We present the Massive Legal Embedding Benchmark (MLEB), the largest, most
diverse, and most comprehensive open-source benchmark for legal information
retrieval to date. MLEB consists of ten expert-annotated datasets spanning
multiple jurisdictions (the US, UK, EU, Australia, Ireland, and Singapore),
document types (cases, legislation, regulatory guidance, contracts, and
literature), and task types (search, zero-shot classification, and question
answering). Seven of the datasets in MLEB were newly constructed in order to
fill domain and jurisdictional gaps in the open-source legal information
retrieval landscape. We document our methodology in building MLEB and creating
the new constituent datasets, and release our code, results, and data openly to
assist with reproducible evaluations.

*Xinfeng Xia,Jiacheng Liu,Xiaofeng Hou,Peng Tang,Mingxuan Zhang,Wenfeng Wang,Chao Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MoE-Prism通过模型-系统协同设计，将僵化的MoE模型转变为弹性服务，提供细粒度控制，显著提升AI服务的适应性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE模型存在"质量悬崖"问题，只能在少数粗粒度操作点之间切换，无法灵活适应不同的服务级别目标(SLO)，导致资源过度配置和成本-质量权衡困难。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1)离线重构引擎将单体专家分解为细粒度"子专家"，使用基于元启发式的分区优化求解器对神经元进行分组；2)在线调度引擎实现QoS感知调度，包含云部署的吞吐量最大化和内存受限设备的延迟优化卸载策略。

Result: 在三个不同MoE模型上的评估显示，MoE-Prism比基线提供超过4倍的不同稳定操作点，在严格延迟预算下吞吐量提升达19.9%，在有限资源下延迟降低达10.36%。

Conclusion: MoE-Prism提供了关键的"控制旋钮"，弥合了模型与系统之间的差距，实现了下一代自适应、高效且QoS感知的AI服务。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, the state-of-the-art in large-scale AI,
achieve high quality by sparsely activating parameters. However, their reliance
on routing between a few monolithic experts via a top-k mechanism creates a
"quality cliff", offering only a few coarse-grained operating points. This
inflexibility forces a difficult trade-off between cost and quality, preventing
adaptation to diverse Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and leading to
significant resource over-provisioning.
  This paper introduces MoE-Prism, a model-system co-design that transforms
rigid MoE models into elastic services. Our methodology is divided into two
phases. First, an \emph{Offline Refactoring Engine} systematically deconstructs
monolithic experts into fine-grained "sub-experts." This engine employs a
partitioning optimization solver that uses a metaheuristic-based approach to
group neurons, preserving functional locality without requiring retraining.
Second, an \emph{Online Scheduling Engine} leverages this new elasticity
through QoS-aware scheduling. It implements specialized policies to solve
complex system problems, including maximizing throughput in cloud deployments
and managing latency-optimized offloading for memory-constrained devices. Our
evaluation across three different MoE models shows that MoE-Prismprovides over
4 times more distinct, stable operating points than the baseline. This allows
an AI service to dynamically improve throughput by up to 19.9\% under a strict
latency budget or reduce latency by up to 10.36\% under limited resources.
MoE-Prism provides the critical "control knob" to bridge the model-system gap,
enabling the next generation of adaptive, efficient, and QoS-aware AI services.

*Yasser Hamidullah,Josef van Genabith,Cristina España-Bonet*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的手语翻译方法，使用目标句子的句子嵌入代替传统的手语注释，无需手动标注，在德语和美国手语数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手语翻译系统依赖手语注释，但这类标注数据通常规模有限且不同数据集间差异很大，限制了系统的可扩展性。

Method: 使用目标句子的句子嵌入作为训练时的监督信号，这种方法不需要手动标注，而是从原始文本数据中学习。支持单语和多语句子嵌入及翻译系统。

Result: 在德语(PHOENIX-2014T)和美国手语(How2Sign)数据集上显著优于其他无注释方法，在没有额外预训练数据的情况下缩小了有注释和无注释系统之间的差距。

Conclusion: 该方法为无手语注释数据的手语翻译设立了新的最先进水平，有效解决了手语注释数据稀缺和标注不一致的问题。

Abstract: State-of-the-art sign language translation (SLT) systems facilitate the
learning process through gloss annotations, either in an end2end manner or by
involving an intermediate step. Unfortunately, gloss labelled sign language
data is usually not available at scale and, when available, gloss annotations
widely differ from dataset to dataset. We present a novel approach using
sentence embeddings of the target sentences at training time that take the role
of glosses. The new kind of supervision does not need any manual annotation but
it is learned on raw textual data. As our approach easily facilitates
multilinguality, we evaluate it on datasets covering German (PHOENIX-2014T) and
American (How2Sign) sign languages and experiment with mono- and multilingual
sentence embeddings and translation systems. Our approach significantly
outperforms other gloss-free approaches, setting the new state-of-the-art for
data sets where glosses are not available and when no additional SLT datasets
are used for pretraining, diminishing the gap between gloss-free and
gloss-dependent systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用语言无关的多模态嵌入监督手语翻译，结合多语言目标增强和视频扰动，实现直接多语言翻译并提升模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手语翻译通常使用单一语言的文本进行训练，限制了可扩展性和跨语言泛化能力。需要一种语言无关的监督方法来提升多语言翻译效果。

Method: 采用在多种语言文本和语音上训练的语言无关多模态嵌入来监督SLT，并提出耦合增强方法，结合多语言目标增强（翻译成多种语言）和视频级扰动。

Result: 实验显示在BLEURT指标上相比仅使用文本句子嵌入监督获得一致提升，在低资源设置下改进更大。

Conclusion: 语言无关嵌入监督结合耦合增强为传统SLT训练提供了可扩展且语义鲁棒的替代方案。

Abstract: Sign language translation (SLT) is typically trained with text in a single
spoken language, which limits scalability and cross-language generalization.
Earlier approaches have replaced gloss supervision with text-based sentence
embeddings, but up to now, these remain tied to a specific language and
modality. In contrast, here we employ language-agnostic, multimodal embeddings
trained on text and speech from multiple languages to supervise SLT, enabling
direct multilingual translation. To address data scarcity, we propose a coupled
augmentation method that combines multilingual target augmentations (i.e.
translations into many languages) with video-level perturbations, improving
model robustness. Experiments show consistent BLEURT gains over text-only
sentence embedding supervision, with larger improvements in low-resource
settings. Our results demonstrate that language-agnostic embedding supervision,
combined with coupled augmentation, provides a scalable and semantically robust
alternative to traditional SLT training.

*Victor Morand,Nadi Tomeh,Josiane Mothe,Benjamin Piwowarski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ToMMeR是一个轻量级模型（<30万参数），通过探测早期LLM层实现实体提及检测，在13个NER基准测试中达到93%的零样本召回率，90%以上的精确率，证明结构化实体表示存在于早期Transformer层中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实体提及检测是信息提取的基础任务，但也是已知的性能瓶颈。研究旨在探索是否可以从早期LLM层中高效恢复结构化实体表示。

Method: 引入ToMMeR模型，通过探测早期LLM层来检测实体提及能力，使用LLM作为判断器，并扩展到跨度分类头。

Result: 在13个NER基准测试中达到93%召回率零样本，90%以上精确率；跨模型分析显示不同架构（1400万-150亿参数）在提及边界上收敛（DICE>75%）；扩展后达到接近SOTA的NER性能（80-87% F1）。

Conclusion: 实体提及检测自然从语言建模中涌现，结构化实体表示存在于早期Transformer层中，可以用最少的参数高效恢复。

Abstract: Identifying which text spans refer to entities -- mention detection -- is
both foundational for information extraction and a known performance
bottleneck. We introduce ToMMeR, a lightweight model (<300K parameters) probing
mention detection capabilities from early LLM layers. Across 13 NER benchmarks,
ToMMeR achieves 93\% recall zero-shot, with over 90\% precision using an LLM as
a judge showing that ToMMeR rarely produces spurious predictions despite high
recall. Cross-model analysis reveals that diverse architectures (14M-15B
parameters) converge on similar mention boundaries (DICE >75\%), confirming
that mention detection emerges naturally from language modeling. When extended
with span classification heads, ToMMeR achieves near SOTA NER performance
(80-87\% F1 on standard benchmarks). Our work provides evidence that structured
entity representations exist in early transformer layers and can be efficiently
recovered with minimal parameters.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DFKI-MLT团队在WMT-SLT 2022手语翻译任务中开发了一个端到端系统，从瑞士德语手语视频翻译成德语文本，但测试集性能大幅下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手语翻译系统通常使用通用seq2seq架构，但往往无法充分利用时间特征。本文旨在开发一个能同时学习时空特征表示和翻译的端到端架构。

Method: 提出单一模型同时学习时空特征表示和翻译的端到端架构，而不是使用定制化输入嵌入的标准方法。

Result: 在开发集上达到5±1 BLEU分，但在测试集上性能大幅下降至0.11±0.06 BLEU分。

Conclusion: 虽然端到端架构在开发集上表现良好，但在测试集上泛化能力不足，表明需要进一步改进模型对新数据集的适应性。

Abstract: This paper describes the DFKI-MLT submission to the WMT-SLT 2022 sign
language translation (SLT) task from Swiss German Sign Language (video) into
German (text). State-of-the-art techniques for SLT use a generic seq2seq
architecture with customized input embeddings. Instead of word embeddings as
used in textual machine translation, SLT systems use features extracted from
video frames. Standard approaches often do not benefit from temporal features.
In our participation, we present a system that learns spatio-temporal feature
representations and translation in a single model, resulting in a real
end-to-end architecture expected to better generalize to new data sets. Our
best system achieved $5\pm1$ BLEU points on the development set, but the
performance on the test dropped to $0.11\pm0.06$ BLEU points.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BLiSS 1.0是一个评估认知启发模型的新基准，通过选择性容忍度测试模型是否能区分自然学习者错误与人工错误，验证训练目标对模型与人类语言习得模式对齐的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弥合性能导向基准与认知启发模型评估之间的差距，提供更贴近人类语言习得模式的评估工具。

Method: 基于280万自然学习者句子构建136,867个控制三元组（正确、学习者、人工错误），测试模型对自然学习者错误与人工错误的容忍度差异。

Result: 实验表明选择性容忍度与标准语法性是不同的能力，模型表现按训练范式强烈聚类。

Conclusion: BLiSS是衡量不同训练目标如何影响模型与人类语言习得系统模式对齐的稳健工具。

Abstract: To bridge the gap between performance-oriented benchmarks and the evaluation
of cognitively inspired models, we introduce BLiSS 1.0, a Benchmark of Learner
Interlingual Syntactic Structure. Our benchmark operationalizes a new paradigm
of selective tolerance, testing whether a model finds a naturalistic learner
error more plausible than a matched, artificial error within the same sentence.
Constructed from over 2.8 million naturalistic learner sentences, BLiSS
provides 136,867 controlled triplets (corrected, learner, artificial) for this
purpose. Experiments on a diverse suite of models demonstrate that selective
tolerance is a distinct capability from standard grammaticality, with
performance clustering strongly by training paradigm. This validates BLiSS as a
robust tool for measuring how different training objectives impact a model's
alignment with the systematic patterns of human language acquisition.

TL;DR: MINED是一个评估大型多模态模型时间感知能力的综合性基准，包含6个关键维度和11个任务，涵盖2104个时间敏感知识样本。评估显示大多数开源LMMs缺乏时间理解能力，但可以通过知识编辑方法有效更新知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准设计静态，无法充分评估LMMs对时间敏感知识的理解能力，需要构建专门评估时间感知能力的基准。

Method: 从维基百科构建MINED基准，由两名专业标注者创建2104个时间敏感知识样本，涵盖6种知识类型，评估15个广泛使用的LMMs。

Result: Gemini-2.5-Pro获得最高平均CEM分数63.07，大多数开源LMMs缺乏时间理解能力；LMMs在组织知识上表现最好，在体育知识上表现最弱；知识编辑方法可以有效更新LMMs的时间敏感知识。

Conclusion: MINED基准揭示了LMMs在时间敏感知识理解方面的局限性，但知识编辑方法为更新这类知识提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) encode rich factual knowledge via cross-modal
pre-training, yet their static representations struggle to maintain an accurate
understanding of time-sensitive factual knowledge. Existing benchmarks remain
constrained by static designs, inadequately evaluating LMMs' ability to
understand time-sensitive knowledge. To address this gap, we propose MINED, a
comprehensive benchmark that evaluates temporal awareness along 6 key
dimensions and 11 challenging tasks: cognition, awareness, trustworthiness,
understanding, reasoning, and robustness. MINED is constructed from Wikipedia
by two professional annotators, containing 2,104 time-sensitive knowledge
samples spanning six knowledge types. Evaluating 15 widely used LMMs on MINED
shows that Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the highest average CEM score of 63.07,
while most open-source LMMs still lack time understanding ability. Meanwhile,
LMMs perform best on organization knowledge, whereas their performance is
weakest on sport. To address these challenges, we investigate the feasibility
of updating time-sensitive knowledge in LMMs through knowledge editing methods
and observe that LMMs can effectively update knowledge via knowledge editing
methods in single editing scenarios.

TL;DR: MBR解码在语音转文本任务中优于波束搜索，在自动语音识别和语音翻译任务中表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于MBR解码在文本到文本生成任务中有效，研究人员期望它在语音到文本任务中也能有效，但目前语音转文本任务仍主要使用波束搜索。

Method: 在英语和日语上使用Whisper及其衍生模型，对自动语音识别和语音翻译任务进行MBR解码评估。

Result: 在大多数实验设置中，MBR解码的准确性超过了波束搜索。

Conclusion: MBR解码是离线自动语音识别和语音翻译任务中实现高准确性的有前景方法。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that sample-based Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding
outperforms beam search in text-to-text generation tasks, such as machine
translation, text summarization, and image captioning. On the other hand, beam
search is the current practice for speech-to-text tasks such as automatic
speech recognition (ASR) and Speech Translation (ST). Given that MBR decoding
is effective in text-to-text generation tasks, it is reasonable to expect it to
also be effective for speech-to-text tasks. In this paper, we evaluate MBR
decoding for ASR and ST tasks on English and Japanese using Whisper and its
derivative models. We observe that the accuracy of MBR decoding outperforms
that of beam search in most of the experimental settings we have evaluated. The
results show that MBR decoding is a promising method for offline ASR and ST
tasks that require high accuracy. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练计算机使用代理需要大量GUI交互数据，但人工标注成本过高，需要寻找可扩展的自动数据挖掘方法。

Method: 开发了Video2Action逆动态模块，包含视频定位模型和动作内容识别器，能够从原始视频中提取精确的动作标签和结构化参数。

Result: 从39,000个YouTube教程视频中自动生成152万交互步骤，在OSWorld-Verified上任务成功率从9.3%提升到15.8%，在AgentNetBench上步骤准确率从64.1%提升到69.3%。

Conclusion: 被动互联网视频可以转化为高质量的训练数据，为计算机使用代理提供可扩展的监督替代方案。

Abstract: Training computer-use agents requires massive amounts of GUI interaction
data, but manually annotating action trajectories at scale is prohibitively
expensive. We present VideoAgentTrek, a scalable pipeline that automatically
mines training data from publicly available screen-recorded videos at web
scale, eliminating the need for manual annotation. Our approach addresses a key
challenge: raw videos contain implicit demonstrations but lack explicit action
labels. To solve this, we develop Video2Action, an inverse dynamics module
(IDM) with two components: (1) a video grounding model that detects and
localizes GUI actions with precise temporal boundaries and context, and (2) an
action-content recognizer that extracts structured parameters like click
coordinates and typed text with high fidelity. Applied to 39,000 YouTube
tutorial videos, our pipeline generates 1.52 million interaction steps
automatically. We leverage this data through continued pretraining followed by
supervised fine-tuning. On OSWorld-Verified, our approach improves task success
rates from 9.3% (SFT-only baseline) to 15.8%, a 70% relative improvement. On
AgentNetBench, step accuracy increases from 64.1% to 69.3%. Our results
demonstrate that passive internet videos can be transformed into high-quality
supervision for computer-use agents, providing a scalable alternative to
expensive manual annotation.

Motivation: 虽然成员推理攻击和机器生成文本检测针对不同目标，但它们的方常基于语言模型的概率分布利用相似信号。由于这两个任务被独立研究，可能导致忽略了另一个任务中开发的更强方法和宝贵见解。

Method: 从理论上证明了在两个任务上实现渐近最高性能的度量是相同的，并通过大规模实证实验验证了跨任务性能的相关性，包括7种最先进的MIA方法和5种最先进的机器文本检测器，涵盖13个领域和10个生成器。

Result: 实验显示跨任务性能存在非常强的秩相关性（rho > 0.6），发现原本为机器文本检测设计的Binoculars方法在MIA基准测试中也达到了最先进性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了两个研究社区之间需要更大的跨任务意识和合作，并引入了MINT评估套件来促进跨任务发展和公平评估。

Abstract: Although membership inference attacks (MIAs) and machine-generated text
detection target different goals, identifying training samples and synthetic
texts, their methods often exploit similar signals based on a language model's
probability distribution. Despite this shared methodological foundation, the
two tasks have been independently studied, which may lead to conclusions that
overlook stronger methods and valuable insights developed in the other task. In
this work, we theoretically and empirically investigate the transferability,
i.e., how well a method originally developed for one task performs on the
other, between MIAs and machine text detection. For our theoretical
contribution, we prove that the metric that achieves the asymptotically highest
performance on both tasks is the same. We unify a large proportion of the
existing literature in the context of this optimal metric and hypothesize that
the accuracy with which a given method approximates this metric is directly
correlated with its transferability. Our large-scale empirical experiments,
including 7 state-of-the-art MIA methods and 5 state-of-the-art machine text
detectors across 13 domains and 10 generators, demonstrate very strong rank
correlation (rho > 0.6) in cross-task performance. We notably find that
Binoculars, originally designed for machine text detection, achieves
state-of-the-art performance on MIA benchmarks as well, demonstrating the
practical impact of the transferability. Our findings highlight the need for
greater cross-task awareness and collaboration between the two research
communities. To facilitate cross-task developments and fair evaluations, we
introduce MINT, a unified evaluation suite for MIAs and machine-generated text
detection, with implementation of 15 recent methods from both tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Transformer language models typically operate with a fixed-length context
window, which has grown in step with large-scale pretraining datasets. In the
BabyLM Challenge, however, many past submissions have defaulted to using much
shorter sequence lengths. We examine the impact of sequence length on BabyLM
pretraining, to answer the simple question: what sequence length should we be
using when training Baby LMs? Using 100M-word training data and fixed compute
budgets, we compare 125M-parameter Mamba and OPT models, finding that although
longer is often better, the optimal length depends on both task and
architecture. Shorter sequences are sufficient for grammatical generalization
tasks whereas longer contexts benefit morphological analogical reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: Lookahead是一个LLM路由框架，通过预测潜在输出来指导模型选择，在多个基准测试中比现有方法平均提升7.7%性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有路由方法仅基于输入查询进行分类，忽略了潜在输出的有价值信息，无法捕捉隐式意图和上下文细微差别，导致复杂或模糊查询的路由决策不理想

Method: 提出Lookahead框架，通过预测模型输出的潜在表示来"预见"可能的输出，使用这些预测指导模型选择，无需完整推理。实现了基于因果和掩码语言模型的两种方法

Result: 在七个公共基准测试（指令遵循、数学推理和代码生成）上的实证评估显示，Lookahead持续优于现有路由基线，比最先进方法平均性能提升7.7%

Conclusion: Lookahead通过预见潜在输出实现了更明智的路由决策，解决了现有方法在复杂查询处理中的局限性

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) routers improve the efficiency of multi-model
systems by directing each query to the most appropriate model while leveraging
the diverse strengths of heterogeneous LLMs. Most existing approaches frame
routing as a classification problem based solely on the input query. While this
reduces overhead by avoiding inference across all models, it overlooks valuable
information that could be gleaned from potential outputs and fails to capture
implicit intent or contextual nuances that often emerge only during response
generation. These limitations can result in suboptimal routing decisions,
particularly for complex or ambiguous queries that require deeper semantic
understanding. To address this challenge, we propose Lookahead, a routing
framework that "foresees" potential model outputs by predicting their latent
representations and uses these predictions to guide model selection, thus
enabling more informed routing without full inference. Within this framework,
we implement two approaches based on causal and masked language models.
Empirical evaluations across seven public benchmarks - spanning instruction
following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation - show that Lookahead
consistently outperforms existing routing baselines, achieving an average
performance gain of 7.7% over the state-of-the-art. Our code is available at
https://github.com/huangcb01/lookahead-routing.

Motivation: 当前语音基础模型的评估在不同任务和模型类型之间是分散的，不同模型在语音处理的不同方面表现出色，因此需要统一的评估框架来指导选择合适的评估方法。

Method: 提出了一个包含三个正交轴线的分类法：评估方面（测量的内容）、模型能力（完成任务所需的能力）和任务要求（执行任务所需的协议）。对现有评估和基准进行了分类分析。

Result: 通过将每个评估映射到模型的能力和方法需求，该分类法提供了一个原则性框架来将模型与合适的评估方法对齐，并揭示了系统性差距（如韵律、交互和推理方面的覆盖不足）。

Conclusion: 这项工作为语音模型评估的选择、解释和扩展提供了概念基础和实践指南，有助于指导未来基准设计的方向。

Abstract: Speech foundation models have recently achieved remarkable capabilities
across a wide range of tasks. However, their evaluation remains disjointed
across tasks and model types. Different models excel at distinct aspects of
speech processing and thus require different evaluation protocols. This paper
proposes a unified taxonomy that addresses the question: Which evaluation is
appropriate for which model? The taxonomy defines three orthogonal axes: the
\textbf{evaluation aspect} being measured, the model capabilities required to
attempt the task, and the task or protocol requirements needed to perform it.
We classify a broad set of existing evaluations and benchmarks along these
axes, spanning areas such as representation learning, speech generation, and
interactive dialogue. By mapping each evaluation to the capabilities a model
exposes (e.g., speech generation, real-time processing) and to its
methodological demands (e.g., fine-tuning data, human judgment), the taxonomy
provides a principled framework for aligning models with suitable evaluation
methods. It also reveals systematic gaps, such as limited coverage of prosody,
interaction, or reasoning, that highlight priorities for future benchmark
design. Overall, this work offers a conceptual foundation and practical guide
for selecting, interpreting, and extending evaluations of speech models.

### [58] [Conditions for Catastrophic Forgetting in Multilingual Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19546)
*Danni Liu,Jan Niehues*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 系统研究多语言模型微调中的灾难性遗忘现象，发现模型与数据规模的相对比例是主要决定因素，指令跟随能力比架构更重要，参数高效微调无优势，跨语言对齐可缓解遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言基础模型在特定语言微调时出现的灾难性遗忘问题，澄清文献中关于遗忘发生条件的碎片化结果。

Method: 使用机器翻译作为测试平台，在不同模型架构、数据规模和微调方法上进行受控实验，系统分析遗忘触发条件。

Result: 发现模型与数据规模的相对比例是遗忘的主要决定因素；指令跟随能力对保留多语言知识比架构更重要；参数高效微调相比全参数微调无优势；跨语言对齐可缓解遗忘并促进对未见目标语言的正面迁移。

Conclusion: 多语言微调中的灾难性遗忘主要由模型与数据规模比例决定，指令能力是关键因素，跨语言对齐是有效的缓解策略。

Abstract: Fine-tuning multilingual foundation models on specific languages often
induces catastrophic forgetting, degrading performance on languages unseen in
fine-tuning. While this phenomenon is widely-documented, the literature
presents fragmented results about when forgetting occurs. To address this
ambiguity, we conduct a systematic empirical study using machine translation as
a testbed to identify the conditions that trigger catastrophic forgetting in
multilingual fine-tuning. Through controlled experiments across different model
architectures, data scales, and fine-tuning approaches, we reveal that the
relative scale between model and data size is a primary determinant of
forgetting. Moreover, we demonstrate that a model's instruction-following
ability is more critical for retaining multilingual knowledge than its
architecture. Contrary to assumptions, parameter-efficient fine-tuning offers
no clear advantage over full fine-tuning in mitigating forgetting. Lastly, we
show that cross-lingual alignment can mitigate forgetting while also
facilitating positive transfer to unseen target languages.

TL;DR: 提出了PBBQ基准数据集，用于评估波斯语大语言模型中的社会偏见，包含16个文化类别和超过37,000个精心策划的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛应用，确保其与社会规范对齐变得至关重要。目前缺乏针对波斯文化背景的社会偏见评估资源。

Method: 通过与社会科学专家合作，让250名来自不同人口统计背景的个体填写问卷，开发了包含16个文化类别的综合基准数据集。

Result: 评估发现当前LLMs在波斯文化中表现出显著的社会偏见，且模型输出往往复制人类偏见模式。

Conclusion: PBBQ数据集为波斯语语言模型的偏见评估和缓解提供了基础，揭示了学习表征与文化刻板印象之间的复杂关系。

Abstract: With the increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs), ensuring their
alignment with social norms has become a critical concern. While prior research
has examined bias detection in various languages, there remains a significant
gap in resources addressing social biases within Persian cultural contexts. In
this work, we introduce PBBQ, a comprehensive benchmark dataset designed to
evaluate social biases in Persian LLMs. Our benchmark, which encompasses 16
cultural categories, was developed through questionnaires completed by 250
diverse individuals across multiple demographics, in close collaboration with
social science experts to ensure its validity. The resulting PBBQ dataset
contains over 37,000 carefully curated questions, providing a foundation for
the evaluation and mitigation of bias in Persian language models. We benchmark
several open-source LLMs, a closed-source model, and Persian-specific
fine-tuned models on PBBQ. Our findings reveal that current LLMs exhibit
significant social biases across Persian culture. Additionally, by comparing
model outputs to human responses, we observe that LLMs often replicate human
bias patterns, highlighting the complex interplay between learned
representations and cultural stereotypes.Upon acceptance of the paper, our PBBQ
dataset will be publicly available for use in future work. Content warning:

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展、可解释的众包流水线用于跨语言新闻相似性评估，并构建了CrossNews-UA数据集，包含乌克兰语与波兰语、俄语、英语的新闻对，测试了多种模型在跨语言新闻分析中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨语言新闻分析数据集由记者和专家手动整理，限制了其可扩展性和对新语言的适应性。

Method: 开发了可扩展、可解释的众包流水线，收集了乌克兰语与相关语言（波兰语、俄语、英语）的新闻对，基于4W标准（Who、What、Where、When）进行语义相似性标注。

Result: 测试了从传统词袋模型、基于Transformer的架构到大型语言模型（LLMs）的一系列模型，揭示了多语言新闻分析中的挑战。

Conclusion: 跨语言新闻比较是验证信息的有前景方法，但多语言新闻分析仍面临挑战，需要更有效的模型和方法。

Abstract: In the era of social networks and rapid misinformation spread, news analysis
remains a critical task. Detecting fake news across multiple languages,
particularly beyond English, poses significant challenges. Cross-lingual news
comparison offers a promising approach to verify information by leveraging
external sources in different languages (Chen and Shu, 2024). However, existing
datasets for cross-lingual news analysis (Chen et al., 2022a) were manually
curated by journalists and experts, limiting their scalability and adaptability
to new languages. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a scalable,
explainable crowdsourcing pipeline for cross-lingual news similarity
assessment. Using this pipeline, we collected a novel dataset CrossNews-UA of
news pairs in Ukrainian as a central language with linguistically and
contextually relevant languages-Polish, Russian, and English. Each news pair is
annotated for semantic similarity with detailed justifications based on the 4W
criteria (Who, What, Where, When). We further tested a range of models, from
traditional bag-of-words, Transformer-based architectures to large language
models (LLMs). Our results highlight the challenges in multilingual news
analysis and offer insights into models performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于字体风格的攻击方法SAD，利用人类与NLP模型对风格化文本的感知差异，通过使用风格字体和字体类表情符号来干扰模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交媒体发展，用户使用风格字体和字体类表情符号表达个性，这些视觉上吸引人的文本对人类可读，但对NLP模型构成潜在威胁，因为模型将这些字符处理为不同的标记，造成干扰。

Method: 提出了Style Attack Disguise (SAD)攻击方法，设计了两种规模：轻量版用于查询效率，强力版用于优越的攻击性能。

Result: 在情感分类和机器翻译任务上对传统模型、大语言模型和商业服务进行实验，证明了SAD的强大攻击性能，并展示了其在多模态任务（文本到图像和文本到语音生成）中的潜在威胁。

Conclusion: 风格化文本在人类与NLP模型之间存在的感知差异构成了安全漏洞，SAD方法有效利用了这种差异进行攻击，对多模态任务也构成威胁。

Abstract: With social media growth, users employ stylistic fonts and font-like emoji to
express individuality, creating visually appealing text that remains
human-readable. However, these fonts introduce hidden vulnerabilities in NLP
models: while humans easily read stylistic text, models process these
characters as distinct tokens, causing interference. We identify this
human-model perception gap and propose a style-based attack, Style Attack
Disguise (SAD). We design two sizes: light for query efficiency and strong for
superior attack performance. Experiments on sentiment classification and
machine translation across traditional models, LLMs, and commercial services
demonstrate SAD's strong attack performance. We also show SAD's potential
threats to multimodal tasks including text-to-image and text-to-speech
generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LlavaCode框架通过将代码压缩为紧凑的语义表示，减少检索上下文到仅几个压缩的单标记向量，在保持代码生成质量的同时显著降低推理延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强生成在代码补全中很有效，但引入上下文会显著增加序列长度，导致推理变慢，这在IDE等交互式环境中是严重限制。

Method: 使用小型投影器模块将代码压缩为紧凑的语义丰富表示，使代码LLM能够理解，将检索上下文减少到仅几个压缩的单标记向量。

Result: 压缩上下文使行补全任务的首次标记时间(TTFT)相比完整RAG流水线减少20-38%，同时代码模型的EM和ES指标显著提升，延迟增加可忽略不计。

Conclusion: LlavaCode框架通过上下文压缩有效解决了RAG在代码补全中的延迟问题，在保持生成质量的同时大幅提升推理速度。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation has emerged as one of the most effective
approaches for code completion, particularly when context from a surrounding
repository is essential. However, incorporating context significantly extends
sequence length, leading to slower inference - a critical limitation for
interactive settings such as IDEs. In this work, we introduce LlavaCode, a
framework that compresses code into compact, semantically rich representations
interpretable by code LLM, enhancing generation quality while reducing the
retrieved context to only a few compressed single-token vectors. Using a small
projector module we can significantly increase the EM and ES metrics of coding
model with negligible latency increase. Our experiments demonstrate that
compressed context enables 20-38% reduction in Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) on
line completion tasks compared to full-RAG pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索开放式查询下LLMs在情绪分析中的挑战，包括上下文模糊性、语言变异性和复杂情绪表达解释困难，这些限制使得通用模型直接应用变得困难。

Method: 在三种不同场景下比较微调和提示工程的效果：(i)微调预训练模型与使用简单提示的通用LLMs性能；(ii)不同情绪提示设计对LLMs的有效性；(iii)情绪分组技术对这些模型的影响。

Result: 实验测试显示，微调预训练模型在情绪识别中达到70%以上的指标，而LLMs需要结构化提示工程和情绪分组来增强其性能。

Conclusion: 这些进展改进了情感分析、人机交互以及跨领域用户行为的理解。

Abstract: Transformer models have significantly advanced the field of emotion
recognition. However, there are still open challenges when exploring open-ended
queries for Large Language Models (LLMs). Although current models offer good
results, automatic emotion analysis in open texts presents significant
challenges, such as contextual ambiguity, linguistic variability, and
difficulty interpreting complex emotional expressions. These limitations make
the direct application of generalist models difficult. Accordingly, this work
compares the effectiveness of fine-tuning and prompt engineering in emotion
detection in three distinct scenarios: (i) performance of fine-tuned
pre-trained models and general-purpose LLMs using simple prompts; (ii)
effectiveness of different emotion prompt designs with LLMs; and (iii) impact
of emotion grouping techniques on these models. Experimental tests attain
metrics above 70% with a fine-tuned pre-trained model for emotion recognition.
Moreover, the findings highlight that LLMs require structured prompt
engineering and emotion grouping to enhance their performance. These
advancements improve sentiment analysis, human-computer interaction, and
understanding of user behavior across various domains.

TL;DR: DiffAdapt框架通过分析推理轨迹的熵模式，为不同难度问题选择最优推理策略，在不微调基础LLM的情况下实现计算效率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理大语言模型虽然表现出色，但会产生冗长的思考轨迹，计算效率低下。研究发现模型在简单问题上存在"过度思考"现象，导致不必要的计算开销。

Method: 基于推理轨迹熵分析，提出DiffAdapt轻量框架，通过小探针分类LLM隐藏状态，为每个问题选择Easy/Normal/Hard推理策略（包含固定提示、温度和最大令牌长度）。

Result: 在5个模型和8个基准测试中，DiffAdapt在保持或提高准确率的同时，将令牌使用量减少高达22.4%。

Conclusion: DiffAdapt为计算高效的推理提供了一条实用路径，通过难度自适应策略显著提升效率而不牺牲性能。

Abstract: Recent reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable
problem-solving abilities but often generate long thinking traces whose utility
is unclear. Our work aims to improve their efficiency, enabling them to reach
high performance without overthinking. First, we analyze the entropy of token
probabilities in reasoning traces. Across three models, we observe a consistent
U-shaped entropy pattern: high entropy on easy problems despite high accuracy,
low entropy on problems with medium difficulty, and high entropy on hard
problems reflecting uncertainty. Specifically, we notice 22--25\% entropy
reduction from easy to medium difficulty regions, suggesting an {overthinking}
phenomenon on easy instances. Building on these insights, we introduce
\textbf{DiffAdapt}, a lightweight framework that selects Easy/Normal/Hard
inference strategies per question based on their difficulty and reasoning trace
entropy. Each inference strategy consists of a fixed prompt, temperature and
maximum token length. In contrast to existing efficiency optimization methods,
our approach does not fine-tune base LLM but a small probe that classifies
LLM's final hidden state, allowing inexpensive adaptation. We comprehensively
evaluate our method on five models and eight benchmarks. Our method achieves
comparable or improved accuracy while reducing token usage by up to 22.4\%,
establishing a practical path toward compute-efficient reasoning.

Motivation: 解决在干扰环境中部署大型模型时的语义理解、隐私保护和可预测延迟等共同目标的问题。

Method: 包含四个组件：SenseFusion轻量编码器、Edge-RAG本地检索层、PromptRouter成本感知策略和Secure Execution安全执行路径。

Result: 在家庭、办公室和诊所部署中，实现亚秒级端到端延迟，减少跨层令牌和带宽成本，通过仅传输离散代码和编辑元数据保护隐私。

Conclusion: 支持边缘优先设计，将语义、隐私和可预测延迟视为在干扰环境中部署大型模型的同等重要目标。

Abstract: We present CoSense-LLM, an edge-first framework that turns continuous
multimodal sensor streams (for example Wi-Fi CSI, IMU, audio, RFID, and
lightweight vision) into compact, verifiable semantic tokens and coordinates
with large language models under explicit latency, energy, bandwidth, and
privacy constraints. CoSense-LLM has four parts: (i) SenseFusion, a lightweight
encoder that aligns sensor embeddings with language and compresses them into
short discrete code sequences; (ii) Edge-RAG, a local hybrid retrieval layer
that grounds generation in site specific policies and notes; (iii)
PromptRouter, a cost and uncertainty aware policy that selects edge only
generation, edge plus retrieval, or compact cloud escalation; and (iv) Secure
Execution, an auditable redaction path that enforces data minimization so raw
waveforms never leave the device. The system works with modern serving
optimizations, including paged or streaming KV caches, FlashAttention style
kernels, speculative decoding, and quantized LoRA adapters, and supports on
device personalization and federated updates under non IID drift. Across home,
office, and clinic deployments, CoSense-LLM delivers grounded explanations
while meeting tight service level objectives: it sustains sub second (p95) end
to end latency on edge dominant paths, reduces inter tier token and bandwidth
costs by preferring local retrieval grounded responses, and preserves privacy
by transmitting only discrete codes and redacted metadata. Ablations show that
Edge-RAG improves factual consistency and reduces contradictions, calibrated
uncertainty enables selective abstention and controlled escalations, and KV
plus decoding accelerators lower energy per decision. The results support an
edge first design that treats semantics, privacy, and predictable latency as co
equal goals for large model deployments in interference prone environments.

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型是否具备动机警觉能力，即能否像人类一样考虑信息来源的动机来评估内容可信度。研究发现LLMs在受控实验中表现良好，但在真实广告场景中表现不佳，通过简单的干预可以显著提升其表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类沟通具有动机性，而LLMs处理的信息往往带有发送者的意图和动机。为了让LLMs在现实世界中有效运作，它们必须能够像人类一样批判性地评估内容，考虑信息来源的动机。

Method: 首先使用认知科学中的受控实验验证LLMs行为是否符合理性模型，然后扩展到赞助在线广告等更自然的环境，并测试简单的干预措施来增强动机警觉性。

Result: LLMs在受控实验中能成功折扣有偏见来源的信息，但在真实广告场景中表现不佳。简单的干预措施能显著提高LLMs与理性模型的对应性。

Conclusion: LLMs具备对他人动机的基本敏感性，但要推广到新的现实世界场景，还需要对这些模型进行进一步改进。

Abstract: Human communication is motivated: people speak, write, and create content
with a particular communicative intent in mind. As a result, information that
large language models (LLMs) and AI agents process is inherently framed by
humans' intentions and incentives. People are adept at navigating such nuanced
information: we routinely identify benevolent or self-serving motives in order
to decide what statements to trust. For LLMs to be effective in the real world,
they too must critically evaluate content by factoring in the motivations of
the source -- for instance, weighing the credibility of claims made in a sales
pitch. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive study of whether LLMs have
this capacity for motivational vigilance. We first employ controlled
experiments from cognitive science to verify that LLMs' behavior is consistent
with rational models of learning from motivated testimony, and find they
successfully discount information from biased sources in a human-like manner.
We then extend our evaluation to sponsored online adverts, a more naturalistic
reflection of LLM agents' information ecosystems. In these settings, we find
that LLMs' inferences do not track the rational models' predictions nearly as
closely -- partly due to additional information that distracts them from
vigilance-relevant considerations. However, a simple steering intervention that
boosts the salience of intentions and incentives substantially increases the
correspondence between LLMs and the rational model. These results suggest that
LLMs possess a basic sensitivity to the motivations of others, but generalizing
to novel real-world settings will require further improvements to these models.

Motivation: 研究提示词与内部表示质量的关系，以揭示预训练嵌入如何支持上下文任务解决，理解语言模型在零样本设置中执行多样化任务的机制。

Method: 对提示词嵌入进行一系列探测实验，分析零样本分类中不同提示词模板组合的效果。

Result: 发现提示词确实影响表示质量，但这些变化与提示词对目标任务的相关性并不一致相关。

Conclusion: 更相关的提示词不一定导致更好的表示，挑战了现有假设，并分析了可能导致这种意外行为的潜在因素。

Abstract: Prompting is a common approach for leveraging LMs in zero-shot settings.
However, the underlying mechanisms that enable LMs to perform diverse tasks
without task-specific supervision remain poorly understood. Studying the
relationship between prompting and the quality of internal representations can
shed light on how pre-trained embeddings may support in-context task solving.
In this empirical study, we conduct a series of probing experiments on prompt
embeddings, analyzing various combinations of prompt templates for zero-shot
classification. Our findings show that while prompting affects the quality of
representations, these changes do not consistently correlate with the relevance
of the prompts to the target task. This result challenges the assumption that
more relevant prompts necessarily lead to better representations. We further
analyze potential factors that may contribute to this unexpected behavior.

Motivation: 法律信息对普通民众来说难以理解和应用，尽管欧盟提供了立法、议会回应和监管文件的开放访问，但这些资源对非专业人士仍具有挑战性。

Method: 构建EUDial数据集（204个博客，880个对话轮次），并提出LexGuide框架，结合检索增强生成和分层主题组织来结构化对话进展。

Result: 结果表明，主动的结构化导航缩小了法律信息可用性与公民理解之间的差距。

Conclusion: EUDial和LexGuide为推进主动法律对话系统提供了实用资源。

Abstract: The accessibility of legal information remains a constant challenge,
particularly for laypersons seeking to understand and apply complex
institutional texts. While the European Union provides open access to
legislation, parliamentary responses, and regulatory documents, these resources
can be challenging for laypeople to explore. In this paper, we introduce
EUDial, a proactive multi-turn dialogue dataset constructed from 204 blogs
curated by the Citizens' Enquiries Unit (AskEP) of the European Parliamentary
Research Service. EUDial contains 880 dialogue turns (averaging 4.3 turns per
dialogue), where each dialogue includes initial questions, structured answers,
and follow-up questions. Beyond dataset construction, we propose the LexGuide
framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation with hierarchical topic
organization to structure dialogue progression, ensuring both comprehensive
coverage of legal aspects and coherence across conversational turns. The
results demonstrate that proactive, structured navigation closes the gap
between the availability of legal information and citizen comprehension,
establishing EUDial and LexGuide as practical resources for advancing proactive
legal dialogue systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法确保LLM按照特定文化或价值观生成内容，直接微调LoRA权重会引入大量参数。

Method: 提出参数高效的因子化超网络框架，从文本描述生成上下文感知的LoRA适配器。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到竞争性性能，参数比最先进基线减少26倍，在文化对齐中展示出更好的泛化能力和细粒度上下文价值捕捉。

Conclusion: Zhyper提供了一种参数高效的方法来实现LLM的文化对齐，具有更好的泛化能力和细粒度控制。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) conditioning refers to instructing an LLM to
generate content in accordance with the norms and values of a specific culture,
beliefs of a particular political orientation, or any desired text-specified
semantic conditioning. Unfortunately, prompt engineering does not ensure that
LLMs behave in accordance with a desired conditioning due to the inductive bias
of the pre-training and alignment datasets. Prior works have focused on
fine-tuning LLMs by directly conditioning the LoRA weights; however, such
methods introduce a large number of parameters. As a remedy, we propose Zhyper,
a parameter-efficient factorized hypernetwork framework that generates
context-aware LoRA adapters from textual descriptions. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks show that Zhyper achieves competitive performance with up to 26x
fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we extend
Zhyper to cultural alignment, demonstrating improved generalization to
out-of-domain settings and a better capturing of fine-grained contextual
values.

TL;DR: 提出SmartSwitch推理框架解决大语言模型在复杂推理中的"浅层思考"问题，通过监控推理过程检测过早放弃的高潜力思路，引导模型进行更深入探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂推理任务中存在"浅层思考"问题，即频繁切换思路而缺乏充分探索，这限制了模型性能和token效率。

Method: SmartSwitch框架包含感知模块和干预模块：感知模块识别思路切换点并用过程奖励模型评估前一个思路的潜力；如果发现高潜力思路被过早放弃，干预模块中断推理，回溯到切换点前，插入"深化提示"鼓励沿该路径进一步探索。

Result: 在具有挑战性的数学推理基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著提升了不同规模大语言模型的性能。

Conclusion: SmartSwitch是一个简单有效的推理策略，可作为即插即用解决方案集成到任何大语言模型中，有效解决浅层思考问题。

Abstract: The long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) capability is central to the recent
breakthroughs achieved by large language models in complex reasoning tasks.
However, the accompanying issue of ''underthinking'', where models exhibit
shallow reasoning by frequently switching thoughts without sufficient
exploration, limits both performance and token efficiency. To address this
problem, we propose a simple yet effective reasoning strategy: the SmartSwitch
inference framework. This framework can be easily integrated into any large
language model as a plug-and-play solution, continuously monitoring the model's
reasoning process to detect underthinking and guide it toward deeper
exploration of promising but overlooked thoughts. Specifically, the perception
module identifies points where thoughts switch and evaluates the potential of
the preceding thought using an off-the-shelf process reward model (PRM). If a
high-potential thought is found to be prematurely abandoned, the intervention
module interrupts the ongoing inference, backtracks to the point before the
switch, and inserts a "deepening prompt" to encourage further exploration along
that promising path. Extensive experiments on challenging mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the

### [72] [AdaSPEC: Selective Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Speculative Decoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19779)
*Yuezhou Hu,Jiaxin Guo,Xinyu Feng,Tuo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaSPEC提出了一种新的知识蒸馏方法，通过选择性过滤难以拟合的token，提高推测解码中草稿模型与目标模型的对齐度，从而提升token接受率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏方法旨在最小化草稿模型和目标模型在所有token上的KL散度，这与推测解码的真实目标（最大化token接受率）不一致。由于容量限制，草稿模型难以完全吸收目标模型的知识，导致性能不佳。

Method: AdaSPEC在知识蒸馏过程中引入选择性token过滤，使用参考模型识别并过滤难以拟合的token，使草稿模型在更简单的token上更好地与目标模型对齐。

Result: 在算术推理、指令跟随、编码和摘要等多样化任务上，使用31M/1.4B和350M/2.7B参数配置，AdaSPEC始终优于最先进的DistillSpec方法，在所有任务中实现了更高的接受率（最高提升15%）。

Conclusion: AdaSPEC通过选择性token过滤改进了知识蒸馏过程，在不影响生成质量的情况下提高了token接受率，为推测解码提供了更有效的草稿模型训练方法。

Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) accelerates large language model inference by
employing a small draft model to generate predictions, which are then verified
by a larger target model. The effectiveness of SD hinges on the alignment
between these models, which is typically enhanced by Knowledge Distillation
(KD). However, conventional KD methods aim to minimize the KL divergence
between the draft and target models across all tokens, a goal that is
misaligned with the true objective of SD, which is to maximize token acceptance
rate. Therefore, draft models often struggle to fully assimilate the target
model's knowledge due to capacity constraints, leading to suboptimal
performance. To address this challenge, we propose AdaSPEC, a novel method that
incorporates selective token filtering into the KD process. AdaSPEC utilizes a
reference model to identify and filter out difficult-to-fit tokens, enabling
the distillation of a draft model that better aligns with the target model on
simpler tokens. This approach improves the overall token acceptance rate
without compromising generation quality. We evaluate AdaSPEC across diverse
tasks, including arithmetic reasoning, instruction-following, coding, and
summarization, using model configurations of 31M/1.4B and 350M/2.7B parameters.
Our results demonstrate that AdaSPEC consistently outperforms the
state-of-the-art DistillSpec method, achieving higher acceptance rates across
all tasks (up to 15\%). The code is publicly available at
https://github.com/yuezhouhu/adaspec.

*Prashant Kodali,Vaishnavi Shivkumar,Swarang Joshi,Monojit Choudhary,Ponnurangam Kumaraguru,Manish Shrivastava*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出通过模型合并方法处理代码混合NLP任务，相比传统微调方法在英语-印地语和英语-西班牙语句子分类任务上获得2-5个F1分数提升，且能更好地迁移到低资源语言对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究模型合并作为代码混合NLP传统适应策略的实用替代方案，旨在更有效地利用未标记数据并提升跨语言对的迁移能力。

Method: 从多语言基础模型出发：(i)在未标记代码混合文本上进行持续预训练获得适应检查点，(ii)将检查点与基础模型合并，(iii)在下游任务数据上进行微调。使用XLM-R和Llama-3.2-1B模型在英语-印地语和英语-西班牙语句子分类任务上评估。

Result: 合并模型持续优于完全微调和CPT->FT方法，F1分数提升2-5点；在跨语言对迁移测试中，合并检查点比单语英语基线表现更好（0.65-0.68 F1 vs 0.61-0.63），表明代码混合知识是低资源语言对更可靠的基板。

Conclusion: 提出了针对不同数据场景的适应方案（仅标记数据；标记+未标记数据；仅迁移），并讨论了在更广泛任务和更大模型上的局限性和扩展考虑。

Abstract: We study model merging as a practical alternative to conventional adaptation
strategies for code-mixed NLP. Starting from a multilingual base model, we: (i)
perform continued pre-training (CPT) on unlabeled code-mixed text to obtain an
adapted checkpoint, (ii) merge checkpoint with the base model, and (iii)
fine-tune (FT) on the downstream task data. We evaluate our approach for
sentence classification (sentiment and hate speech) task in English-Hindi
(En-Hi) and English-Spanish (En-Es) using XLM-R and Llama-3.2-1B models. Our
results show that merged models consistently outperform full fine-tuning and
CPT->FT. We observe gains of 2--5 points in F1 over full fine-tuning and ~1-2
points over CPT->FT, indicating that unlabeled data is leveraged more
effectively via merging than via CPT alone. Zero-/few-shot prompting with
larger LLMs (e.g., Llama-3.3-70B) lags behind fine-tuned and merged
checkpoints, underscoring limits of in-context learning for code-mixed inputs.
We further test cross-pair transfer by training on En-Hi and evaluating on
En-Ta and En-Ml: merged checkpoints transfer more strongly than
monolingual-English baselines (e.g., TV/TIES variants reaching 0.65-0.68 F1 vs
0.61-0.63 for full fine-tuning), suggesting that code-mixed knowledge is a more
reliable substrate for low-resource pairs. We conclude with adaptation recipes
matched to common data regimes (labeled only; labeled+unlabeled; transfer-only)
and discuss limitations and scaling considerations for broader tasks and larger
models.

*Saptarshi Sengupta,Zhengyu Zhou,Jun Araki,Xingbo Wang,Bingqing Wang,Suhang Wang,Zhe Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ToolDreamer是一个框架，通过使用LLM生成假设性的工具描述来改进工具检索，使检索器能更好地理解用户查询与工具描述之间的语义对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索模型基于用户查询与工具描述的相似性进行工具排名，但用户请求往往与工具描述语言不匹配，导致检索效果不佳。

Method: 提出ToolDreamer框架，使用LLM生成假设性的工具描述，让检索器基于这些描述来获取相关工具，实现查询与工具在描述语言空间中的自然对齐。

Result: 在ToolRet数据集上应用ToolDreamer，提高了稀疏和密集检索器的性能，无论是否进行训练都表现出改进。

Conclusion: 该框架将部分推理负担转移到检索器上，使LLM能够有效处理大量工具而不会超出上下文窗口限制。

Abstract: Tool calling has become increasingly popular for Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, for large tool sets, the resulting tokens would exceed the
LLM's context window limit, making it impossible to include every tool. Hence,
an external retriever is used to provide LLMs with the most relevant tools for
a query. Existing retrieval models rank tools based on the similarity between a
user query and a tool description (TD). This leads to suboptimal retrieval as
user requests are often poorly aligned with the language of TD. To remedy the
issue, we propose ToolDreamer, a framework to condition retriever models to
fetch tools based on hypothetical (synthetic) TD generated using an LLM, i.e.,
description of tools that the LLM feels will be potentially useful for the
query. The framework enables a more natural alignment between queries and tools
within the language space of TD's. We apply ToolDreamer on the ToolRet dataset
and show that our method improves the performance of sparse and dense
retrievers with and without training, thus showcasing its flexibility. Through
our proposed framework, our aim is to offload a portion of the reasoning burden
to the retriever so that the LLM may effectively handle a large collection of
tools without inundating its context window.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级框架，通过优化提示空间（自然性、文化适应性和难度增强）来提升多语言LLM性能，在相同数据条件下显著优于仅翻译的基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成数据在多语言LLM扩展中存在瓶颈，翻译式提示继承了英语中心框架和风格，忽略了文化维度，限制了模型泛化能力。

Method: 引入轻量级提示空间优化框架，系统地将翻译提示转换为自然性、文化适应性和难度增强的版本，在12种语言的7个语系上进行测试。

Result: 在相同数据条件下，相比仅翻译基线，Global-MMLU准确率提升4.7%，Flores XCometXL提升2.4%，mArenaHard偏好胜率提升35.3%。

Conclusion: 提示空间优化是构建更鲁棒、文化基础更好、全球能力更强的多语言LLM的简单而强大的范式。

Abstract: Synthetic data has become a cornerstone for scaling large language models,
yet its multilingual use remains bottlenecked by translation-based prompts.
This strategy inherits English-centric framing and style and neglects cultural
dimensions, ultimately constraining model generalization. We argue that the
overlooked prompt space-the very inputs that define training
distributions-offers a more powerful lever for improving multilingual
performance. We introduce a lightweight framework for prompt-space
optimization, where translated prompts are systematically transformed for
Naturalness, Cultural Adaptation, and Difficulty Enhancement. Using an
off-the-shelf multilingual LLM, we apply these transformations to prompts for
12 languages spanning 7 families. Under identical data conditions, our
approaches achieve substantial and consistent downstream improvements over the
translation-only baseline: +4.7% on Global-MMLU accuracy, +2.4% on Flores
XCometXL and +35.3% wins in preferences on mArenaHard. We establish
prompt-space optimization as a simple yet powerful paradigm for building
multilingual LLMs that are more robust, culturally grounded, and globally
capable.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Scaf-GRPO通过提供渐进式提示来解决强化学习中的"学习悬崖"问题，当模型学习停滞时注入分层提示，显著提升模型在复杂数学问题上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决强化学习中"学习悬崖"现象——当问题远超模型当前能力时，持续的零奖励信号导致学习梯度消失，阻碍模型在困难问题上的进步。

Method: 提出Scaf-GRPO框架：首先诊断学习停滞，然后注入分层提示（从抽象概念到具体步骤），让模型自行构建有效解决方案。

Result: 在AIME24基准测试中，将Qwen2.5-Math-7B模型的pass@1分数相比标准GRPO基线相对提升了44.3%。

Conclusion: 该框架为解锁模型解决超出其能力范围问题的潜力提供了稳健有效的方法，是扩展LLM自主推理前沿的关键一步。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards has emerged as a powerful
technique for enhancing the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, these methods are fundamentally constrained by the
''learning cliff'' phenomenon: when faced with problems far beyond their
current capabilities, models consistently fail, yielding a persistent
zero-reward signal. In policy optimization algorithms like GRPO, this collapses
the advantage calculation to zero, rendering these difficult problems invisible
to the learning gradient and stalling progress. To overcome this, we introduce
Scaf-GRPO (Scaffolded Group Relative Policy Optimization), a progressive
training framework that strategically provides minimal guidance only when a
model's independent learning has plateaued. The framework first diagnoses
learning stagnation and then intervenes by injecting tiered in-prompt hints,
ranging from abstract concepts to concrete steps, enabling the model to
construct a valid solution by itself. Extensive experiments on challenging
mathematics benchmarks demonstrate Scaf-GRPO's effectiveness, boosting the
pass@1 score of the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model on the AIME24 benchmark by a relative
44.3% over a vanilla GRPO baseline. This result demonstrates our framework
provides a robust and effective methodology for unlocking a model's ability to
solve problems previously beyond its reach, a critical step towards extending
the frontier of autonomous reasoning in LLM.

TL;DR: Hubble是一套用于研究LLM记忆机制的开源模型套件，包含标准版和扰动版，通过控制文本插入来模拟记忆风险，揭示了训练数据频率对记忆的影响规律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型的记忆机制，特别是敏感数据的记忆风险，为理解和管理LLM记忆问题提供科学基础。

Method: 开发标准模型和扰动模型，在训练过程中控制插入特定文本（如书籍段落、传记、测试集），比较不同参数规模和训练token数量下的记忆效果。

Result: 发现记忆风险取决于敏感数据在训练语料中的相对频率，密码在小语料中比在大语料中更容易被记忆；敏感数据缺乏持续暴露会被遗忘。

Conclusion: 提出了两个应对记忆风险的最佳实践：通过增加训练语料规模稀释敏感数据，以及安排敏感数据在训练早期出现。Hubble为记忆研究、成员推理和机器遗忘提供了理想测试平台。

Abstract: We present Hubble, a suite of fully open-source large language models (LLMs)
for the scientific study of LLM memorization. Hubble models come in standard
and perturbed variants: standard models are pretrained on a large English
corpus, and perturbed models are trained in the same way but with controlled
insertion of text (e.g., book passages, biographies, and test sets) designed to
emulate key memorization risks. Our core release includes 8 models -- standard
and perturbed models with 1B or 8B parameters, pretrained on 100B or 500B
tokens -- establishing that memorization risks are determined by the frequency
of sensitive data relative to size of the training corpus (i.e., a password
appearing once in a smaller corpus is memorized better than the same password
in a larger corpus). Our release also includes 6 perturbed models with text
inserted at different pretraining phases, showing that sensitive data without
continued exposure can be forgotten. These findings suggest two best practices
for addressing memorization risks: to dilute sensitive data by increasing the
size of the training corpus, and to order sensitive data to appear earlier in
training. Beyond these general empirical findings, Hubble enables a broad range
of memorization research; for example, analyzing the biographies reveals how
readily different types of private information are memorized. We also
demonstrate that the randomized insertions in Hubble make it an ideal testbed
for membership inference and machine unlearning, and invite the community to
further explore, benchmark, and build upon our work.

Abstract: Earth observation involves collecting, analyzing, and processing an
ever-growing mass of data. Automatically harvesting information is crucial for
addressing significant societal, economic, and environmental challenges,
ranging from environmental monitoring to urban planning and disaster
management. However, the high dimensionality of these data poses challenges in
terms of sparsity, inefficiency, and the curse of dimensionality, which limits
the effectiveness of machine learning models. Dimensionality reduction (DR)
techniques, specifically feature extraction, address these challenges by
preserving essential data properties while reducing complexity and enhancing
tasks such as data compression, cleaning, fusion, visualization, anomaly
detection, and prediction. This review provides a handbook for leveraging DR
across the RS data value chain and identifies opportunities for under-explored
DR algorithms and their application in future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基准标记在美学和其他原因下显得突兀，需要一种能够隐蔽地融入环境的跟踪标记。

Method: 使用端到端的深度隐写术方法，联合训练编码网络模块，将任意图像转换为Ninja Codes，并训练检测模块进行识别。

Conclusion: Ninja Codes在传统基准标记因外观明显而不适用的场景中具有特殊价值，可用于增强现实、机器人技术等应用。

Abstract: In this paper we describe Ninja Codes, neurally-generated fiducial markers
that can be made to naturally blend into various real-world environments. An
encoder network converts arbitrary images into Ninja Codes by applying visually
modest alterations; the resulting codes, printed and pasted onto surfaces, can
provide stealthy 6-DoF location tracking for a wide range of applications
including augmented reality, robotics, motion-based user interfaces, etc. Ninja
Codes can be printed using off-the-shelf color printers on regular printing
paper, and can be detected using any device equipped with a modern RGB camera
and capable of running inference. Using an end-to-end process inspired by prior
work on deep steganography, we jointly train a series of network modules that
perform the creation and detection of Ninja Codes. Through experiments, we
demonstrate Ninja Codes' ability to provide reliable location tracking under
common indoor lighting conditions, while successfully concealing themselves
within diverse environmental textures. We expect Ninja Codes to offer
particular value in scenarios where the conspicuous appearances of conventional
fiducial markers make them undesirable for aesthetic and other reasons.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决自动驾驶中高级感知、预测和规划问题的准确回答，利用预训练视觉语言模型但需要更好的提示工程和上下文信息来提升性能。

Method: 第一阶段：使用Qwen2.5-VL-32B大模型，输入六摄像头数据、历史时间窗口和思维链提示；第二阶段：增强提示，加入场景元数据和任务特定指令。采用自一致性集成提高可靠性。

Result: 在驾驶QA基准测试中显著优于基线模型：第一阶段65.1%准确率（零样本62.61%），自一致性提升至66.85%，第二阶段达67.37%。在严重视觉损坏下仍保持96%准确率。

Conclusion: 精心设计的提示和上下文基础可以大幅提升预训练视觉语言模型在高级驾驶问答任务中的性能。

Abstract: We present a two-phase vision-language QA system for autonomous driving that
answers high-level perception, prediction, and planning questions. In Phase-1,
a large multimodal LLM (Qwen2.5-VL-32B) is conditioned on six-camera inputs, a
short temporal window of history, and a chain-of-thought prompt with few-shot
exemplars. A self-consistency ensemble (multiple sampled reasoning chains)
further improves answer reliability. In Phase-2, we augment the prompt with
nuScenes scene metadata (object annotations, ego-vehicle state, etc.) and
category-specific question instructions (separate prompts for perception,
prediction, planning tasks). In experiments on a driving QA benchmark, our
approach significantly outperforms the baseline Qwen2.5 models. For example,
using 5 history frames and 10-shot prompting in Phase-1 yields 65.1% overall
accuracy (vs.62.61% with zero-shot); applying self-consistency raises this to
66.85%. Phase-2 achieves 67.37% overall. Notably, the system maintains 96%
accuracy under severe visual corruption. These results demonstrate that
carefully engineered prompts and contextual grounding can greatly enhance
high-level driving QA with pretrained vision-language models.

Motivation: 纵向分析序列放射影像面临数据挑战：如何有效建模高分辨率图像序列和不规则时间间隔。现有方法要么牺牲空间信息，要么计算效率低下且不兼容非均匀时间步长。

Method: 提出连续时间选择性扫描机制，将真实检查时间差整合到状态转换中，并辅以多尺度3D邻域融合模块来捕捉时空关系。

Conclusion: 该模型凭借线性复杂度能够高效处理长而复杂的乳腺筛查历史，为纵向图像分析提供了新框架。

Abstract: Longitudinal analysis of sequential radiological images is hampered by a
fundamental data challenge: how to effectively model a sequence of
high-resolution images captured at irregular time intervals. This data
structure contains indispensable spatial and temporal cues that current methods
fail to fully exploit. Models often compromise by either collapsing spatial
information into vectors or applying spatio-temporal models that are
computationally inefficient and incompatible with non-uniform time steps. We
address this challenge with Time-Aware $\Delta$t-Mamba3D, a novel state-space
architecture adapted for longitudinal medical imaging. Our model simultaneously
encodes irregular inter-visit intervals and rich spatio-temporal context while
remaining computationally efficient. Its core innovation is a continuous-time
selective scanning mechanism that explicitly integrates the true time
difference between exams into its state transitions. This is complemented by a
multi-scale 3D neighborhood fusion module that robustly captures
spatio-temporal relationships. In a comprehensive breast cancer risk prediction
benchmark using sequential screening mammogram exams, our model shows superior
performance, improving the validation c-index by 2-5 percentage points and
achieving higher 1-5 year AUC scores compared to established variants of
recurrent, transformer, and state-space models. Thanks to its linear
complexity, the model can efficiently process long and complex patient
screening histories of mammograms, forming a new framework for longitudinal
image analysis.

Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models have enabled high-quality video synthesis, yet
often fail to generate temporally coherent and physically plausible motion. A
key reason is the models' insufficient understanding of complex motions that
natural videos often entail. Recent works tackle this problem by aligning
diffusion model features with those from pretrained video encoders. However,
these encoders mix video appearance and dynamics into entangled features,
limiting the benefit of such alignment. In this paper, we propose a
motion-centric alignment framework that learns a disentangled motion subspace
from a pretrained video encoder. This subspace is optimized to predict
ground-truth optical flow, ensuring it captures true motion dynamics. We then
align the latent features of a text-to-video diffusion model to this new
subspace, enabling the generative model to internalize motion knowledge and
generate more plausible videos. Our method improves the physical commonsense in
a state-of-the-art video diffusion model, while preserving adherence to textual
prompts, as evidenced by empirical evaluations on VideoPhy, VideoPhy2, VBench,
and VBench-2.0, along with a user study.

TL;DR: PoSh是一个用于详细图像描述评估的新指标，它使用场景图作为结构化评分标准来指导LLM作为评判者，在细粒度错误识别方面优于现有指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像描述评估指标（如CIDEr、SPICE）是为短文本设计的，无法有效评估长文本中的属性和关系错误，需要更敏感和可解释的评估方法。

Method: PoSh使用场景图作为结构化评分标准，通过LLM作为评判者来生成基于细粒度错误的聚合分数，并引入了新的数据集DOCENT进行验证。

Result: PoSh在DOCENT数据集上与人类评分者的相关性比最佳替代方法高出0.05 Spearman ρ，对图像类型具有鲁棒性，并且能够作为有效的奖励函数。

Conclusion: PoSh和DOCENT为详细图像描述评估提供了更好的工具，揭示了基础模型在描述具有丰富场景动态的图像时的局限性，为VLM进展设立了新的挑战任务。

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced into detailed image
description, evaluation remains a challenge. Standard metrics (e.g. CIDEr,
SPICE) were designed for short texts and tuned to recognize errors that are now
uncommon, such as object misidentification. In contrast, long texts require
sensitivity to attribute and relation attachments and scores that localize
errors to particular text spans. In this work, we introduce PoSh, a metric for
detailed image description that uses scene graphs as structured rubrics to
guide LLMs-as-a-Judge, producing aggregate scores grounded in fine-grained
errors (e.g. mistakes in compositional understanding). PoSh is replicable,
interpretable and a better proxy for human raters than existing metrics
(including GPT4o-as-a-Judge). To validate PoSh, we introduce a challenging new
dataset, DOCENT. This novel benchmark contains artwork, paired with
expert-written references, and model-generated descriptions, augmented with
granular and coarse judgments of their quality from art history students. Thus,
DOCENT enables evaluating both detailed image description metrics and detailed
image description itself in a challenging new domain. We show that PoSh
achieves stronger correlations (+0.05 Spearman $\rho$) with the human judgments
in DOCENT than the best open-weight alternatives, is robust to image type
(using CapArena, an existing dataset of web imagery) and is a capable reward
function, outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning. Then, using PoSh, we
characterize the performance of open and closed models in describing the
paintings, sketches and statues in DOCENT and find that foundation models
struggle to achieve full, error-free coverage of images with rich scene
dynamics, establishing a demanding new task to gauge VLM progress. Through both
PoSh and DOCENT, we hope to enable advances in important areas such as
assistive text generation.

embeddings can be extracted from images, 2D keypoints, 3D skeletons, mesh
models, and lots of other modalities. Yet, there are limited instances where
the correlation among all of those representations has been clearly researched
using a contrastive paradigm. In this paper, we propose UniHPR, a unified Human
Pose Representation learning pipeline, which aligns Human Pose embeddings from
images, 2D and 3D human poses. To align more than two data representations at
the same time, we propose a novel singular value-based contrastive learning
loss, which better aligns different modalities and further boosts performance.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the aligned representation, we choose 2D and
3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) as our evaluation tasks. In our evaluation, with
a simple 3D human pose decoder, UniHPR achieves remarkable performance metrics:
MPJPE 49.9mm on the Human3.6M dataset and PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on the 3DPW dataset
with cross-domain evaluation. Meanwhile, we are able to achieve 2D and 3D pose
retrieval with our unified human pose representations in Human3.6M dataset,
where the retrieval error is 9.24mm in MPJPE.

Abstract: In the realm of medical diagnostics, rapid advancements in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) have significantly yielded remarkable improvements in brain
tumor segmentation. Encoder-Decoder architectures, such as U-Net, have played a
transformative role by effectively extracting meaningful representations in 3D
brain tumor segmentation from Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. However,
standard U-Net models encounter challenges in accurately delineating tumor
regions, especially when dealing with irregular shapes and ambiguous
boundaries. Additionally, training robust segmentation models on
high-resolution MRI data, such as the BraTS datasets, necessitates high
computational resources and often faces challenges associated with class
imbalance. This study proposes the integration of the attention mechanism into
the 3D U-Net model, enabling the model to capture intricate details and
prioritize informative regions during the segmentation process. Additionally, a
tumor detection algorithm based on digital image processing techniques is
utilized to address the issue of imbalanced training data and mitigate bias.
This study aims to enhance the performance of brain tumor segmentation,
ultimately improving the reliability of diagnosis. The proposed model is
thoroughly evaluated and assessed on the BraTS 2020 dataset using various
performance metrics to accomplish this goal. The obtained results indicate that
the model outperformed related studies, exhibiting dice of 0.975, specificity
of 0.988, and sensitivity of 0.995, indicating the efficacy of the proposed
model in improving brain tumor segmentation, offering valuable insights for
reliable diagnosis in clinical settings.

Abstract: Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women worldwide, emphasizing
the need for early detection and accurate diagnosis. As such Ultrasound
Imaging, a reliable and cost-effective tool, is used for this purpose, however
the sensitive nature of medical data makes it challenging to develop accurate
and private artificial intelligence models. A solution is Federated Learning as
it is a promising technique for distributed machine learning on sensitive
medical data while preserving patient privacy. However, training on
non-Independent and non-Identically Distributed (non-IID) local datasets can
impact the accuracy and generalization of the trained model, which is crucial
for accurate tumour boundary delineation in BC segmentation. This study aims to
tackle this challenge by applying the Federated Proximal (FedProx) method to
non-IID Ultrasonic Breast Cancer Imaging datasets. Moreover, we focus on
enhancing tumour segmentation accuracy by incorporating a modified U-Net model
with attention mechanisms. Our approach resulted in a global model with 96%
accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in enhancing tumour
segmentation accuracy while preserving patient privacy. Our findings suggest
that FedProx has the potential to be a promising approach for training precise
machine learning models on non-IID local medical datasets.

Conclusion: X-Ego-CS和CECL为电子竞技中的跨自我中心多智能体基准测试奠定了基础，将游戏理解定位为多智能体建模和战术学习的测试平台。

Abstract: Human team tactics emerge from each player's individual perspective and their
ability to anticipate, interpret, and adapt to teammates' intentions. While
advances in video understanding have improved the modeling of team interactions
in sports, most existing work relies on third-person broadcast views and
overlooks the synchronous, egocentric nature of multi-agent learning. We
introduce X-Ego-CS, a benchmark dataset consisting of 124 hours of gameplay
footage from 45 professional-level matches of the popular e-sports game
Counter-Strike 2, designed to facilitate research on multi-agent
decision-making in complex 3D environments. X-Ego-CS provides cross-egocentric
video streams that synchronously capture all players' first-person perspectives
along with state-action trajectories. Building on this resource, we propose
Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL), which aligns teammates' egocentric
visual streams to foster team-level tactical situational awareness from an
individual's perspective. We evaluate CECL on a teammate-opponent location
prediction task, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing an agent's
ability to infer both teammate and opponent positions from a single
first-person view using state-of-the-art video encoders. Together, X-Ego-CS and
CECL establish a foundation for cross-egocentric multi-agent benchmarking in
esports. More broadly, our work positions gameplay understanding as a testbed
for multi-agent modeling and tactical learning, with implications for
spatiotemporal reasoning and human-AI teaming in both virtual and real-world
domains. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/HATS-ICT/x-ego.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 疟疾主要通过雌性按蚊传播，常导致0-5岁儿童死亡。传统显微镜观察血涂片图像的方法依赖专业知识和人工操作，容易误诊，因此需要计算机辅助自动诊断系统。

Method: 使用六种深度卷积网络从血细胞图像中提取深层特征，并将其分类为疟疾感染细胞或健康细胞。

Result: Residual Attention Network和XceptionNet在公开疟疾细胞图像数据集上表现最好，平均准确率分别为97.28%和97.55%，优于其他相关方法。

Conclusion: 这些发现强烈支持深度学习驱动的方法在自动可靠检测疟疾方面的可行性，同时最大限度地减少直接人工参与。

Abstract: Malaria, which primarily spreads with the bite of female anopheles mosquitos,
often leads to death of people - specifically children in the age-group of 0-5
years. Clinical experts identify malaria by observing RBCs in blood smeared
images with a microscope. Lack of adequate professional knowledge and skills,
and most importantly manual involvement may cause incorrect diagnosis.
Therefore, computer aided automatic diagnosis stands as a preferred substitute.
In this paper, well-demonstrated deep networks have been applied to extract
deep intrinsic features from blood cell images and thereafter classify them as
malaria infected or healthy cells. Among the six deep convolutional networks
employed in this work viz. AlexNet, XceptionNet, VGG-19, Residual Attention
Network, DenseNet-121 and Custom-CNN. Residual Attention Network and
XceptionNet perform relatively better than the rest on a publicly available
malaria cell image dataset. They yield an average accuracy of 97.28% and 97.55%
respectively, that surpasses other related methods on the same dataset. These
findings highly encourage the reality of deep learning driven method for
automatic and reliable detection of malaria while minimizing direct manual
involvement.

TL;DR: PruneHal是一种无需训练的方法，通过自适应KV缓存剪枝来增强MLLMs对关键视觉信息的关注，从而减少幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么引入额外数据进行训练，要么在推理时加入外部或内部信息，都会带来额外计算成本。研究发现MLLMs中的幻觉与视觉token注意力分配不足密切相关。

Method: 提出PruneHal方法，利用自适应KV缓存剪枝来增强模型对关键视觉信息的关注，无需额外训练且几乎不增加推理成本。

Result: 在多个主流MLLMs上使用广泛使用的幻觉评估基准进行评估，获得了稳健且出色的结果。

Conclusion: PruneHal是首个将token剪枝应用于MLLMs幻觉缓解的方法，具有模型无关性，并能与不同的解码策略无缝集成。

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in recent years, the issue of hallucinations remains a major
challenge. To mitigate this phenomenon, existing solutions either introduce
additional data for further training or incorporate external or internal
information during inference. However, these approaches inevitably introduce
extra computational costs. In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in
MLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual
tokens. In particular, the presence of redundant visual tokens disperses the
model's attention, preventing it from focusing on the most informative ones. As
a result, critical visual cues are often under-attended, which in turn
exacerbates the occurrence of hallucinations. Building on this observation, we
propose \textbf{PruneHal}, a training-free, simple yet effective method that
leverages adaptive KV cache pruning to enhance the model's focus on critical
visual information, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to apply token pruning for hallucination mitigation
in MLLMs. Notably, our method don't require additional training and incurs
nearly no extra inference cost. Moreover, PruneHal is model-agnostic and can be
seamlessly integrated with different decoding strategies, including those
specifically designed for hallucination mitigation. We evaluate PruneHal on
several widely used hallucination evaluation benchmarks using four mainstream
MLLMs, achieving robust and outstanding results that highlight the
effectiveness and superiority of our method. Our code will be publicly
available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Video Consistency Distance (VCD)指标，通过基于奖励的微调框架增强视频扩散模型的时间一致性，特别针对图像到视频生成任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的奖励函数主要关注整个生成视频序列的质量，但在图像到视频生成任务中，时间一致性常常受到影响，需要专门的方法来改进。

Method: 在视频帧特征的频域空间中定义VCD指标，通过频域分析有效捕捉帧信息，并基于此指标进行奖励微调。

Result: 在多个I2V数据集上的实验表明，使用VCD微调的视频生成模型显著增强了时间一致性，且不降低其他性能。

Conclusion: VCD是一种有效的指标，能够专门提升视频生成模型的时间一致性，适用于图像到视频生成任务。

Abstract: Reward-based fine-tuning of video diffusion models is an effective approach
to improve the quality of generated videos, as it can fine-tune models without
requiring real-world video datasets. However, it can sometimes be limited to
specific performances because conventional reward functions are mainly aimed at
enhancing the quality across the whole generated video sequence, such as
aesthetic appeal and overall consistency. Notably, the temporal consistency of
the generated video often suffers when applying previous approaches to
image-to-video (I2V) generation tasks. To address this limitation, we propose
Video Consistency Distance (VCD), a novel metric designed to enhance temporal
consistency, and fine-tune a model with the reward-based fine-tuning framework.
To achieve coherent temporal consistency relative to a conditioning image, VCD
is defined in the frequency space of video frame features to capture frame
information effectively through frequency-domain analysis. Experimental results
across multiple I2V datasets demonstrate that fine-tuning a video generation
model with VCD significantly enhances temporal consistency without degrading
other performance compared to the previous method.

Motivation: 现有驾驶世界模型主要关注生成质量和可控性指标，但忽略了对于自动驾驶性能至关重要的下游感知任务评估。现有方法需要先在合成数据上预训练再在真实数据上微调，导致训练周期翻倍，当基线方法也使用双倍周期时，合成数据的优势变得不明显。

Method: Dream4Drive首先将输入视频分解为多个3D感知引导图，然后将3D资源渲染到这些引导图上，最后微调驾驶世界模型以生成编辑后的多视角逼真视频，用于训练下游感知模型。

Result: 该框架能够大规模生成多视角角案例，显著提升自动驾驶中的角案例感知能力。同时贡献了DriveObj3D大规模3D资源数据集，覆盖典型驾驶场景类别。

Conclusion: 综合实验表明，Dream4Drive在各种训练周期下都能有效提升下游感知模型的性能，为未来研究提供了有价值的工具和数据集。

Abstract: Recent advancements in driving world models enable controllable generation of
high-quality RGB videos or multimodal videos. Existing methods primarily focus
on metrics related to generation quality and controllability. However, they
often overlook the evaluation of downstream perception tasks, which are
$\mathbf{really\ crucial}$ for the performance of autonomous driving. Existing
methods usually leverage a training strategy that first pretrains on synthetic
data and finetunes on real data, resulting in twice the epochs compared to the
baseline (real data only). When we double the epochs in the baseline, the
benefit of synthetic data becomes negligible. To thoroughly demonstrate the
benefit of synthetic data, we introduce Dream4Drive, a novel synthetic data
generation framework designed for enhancing the downstream perception tasks.
Dream4Drive first decomposes the input video into several 3D-aware guidance
maps and subsequently renders the 3D assets onto these guidance maps. Finally,
the driving world model is fine-tuned to produce the edited, multi-view
photorealistic videos, which can be used to train the downstream perception
models. Dream4Drive enables unprecedented flexibility in generating multi-view
corner cases at scale, significantly boosting corner case perception in
autonomous driving. To facilitate future research, we also contribute a
large-scale 3D asset dataset named DriveObj3D, covering the typical categories
in driving scenarios and enabling diverse 3D-aware video editing. We conduct
comprehensive experiments to show that Dream4Drive can effectively boost the
performance of downstream perception models under various training epochs.

Result: 在N3V和Technicolor数据集上的广泛实验表明，MoE-GS在保持效率的同时持续优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: MoE-GS是首个将专家混合技术引入动态高斯溅射的方法，通过统一框架和效率优化策略实现了更好的渲染质量和性能平衡。

Abstract: Recent advances in dynamic scene reconstruction have significantly benefited
from 3D Gaussian Splatting, yet existing methods show inconsistent performance
across diverse scenes, indicating no single approach effectively handles all
dynamic challenges. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mixture of
Experts for Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (MoE-GS), a unified framework
integrating multiple specialized experts via a novel Volume-aware Pixel Router.
Our router adaptively blends expert outputs by projecting volumetric
Gaussian-level weights into pixel space through differentiable weight
splatting, ensuring spatially and temporally coherent results. Although MoE-GS
improves rendering quality, the increased model capacity and reduced FPS are
inherent to the MoE architecture. To mitigate this, we explore two
complementary directions: (1) single-pass multi-expert rendering and gate-aware
Gaussian pruning, which improve efficiency within the MoE framework, and (2) a
distillation strategy that transfers MoE performance to individual experts,
enabling lightweight deployment without architectural changes. To the best of
our knowledge, MoE-GS is the first approach incorporating Mixture-of-Experts
techniques into dynamic Gaussian splatting. Extensive experiments on the N3V
and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that MoE-GS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods with improved efficiency. Video demonstrations are

Conclusion: SFGFusion通过表面拟合引导的多模态融合方法，有效解决了4D雷达点云稀疏性问题，提升了3D物体检测性能。

Abstract: 3D object detection is essential for autonomous driving. As an emerging
sensor, 4D imaging radar offers advantages as low cost, long-range detection,
and accurate velocity measurement, making it highly suitable for object
detection. However, its sparse point clouds and low resolution limit object
geometric representation and hinder multi-modal fusion. In this study, we
introduce SFGFusion, a novel camera-4D imaging radar detection network guided
by surface fitting. By estimating quadratic surface parameters of objects from
image and radar data, the explicit surface fitting model enhances spatial
representation and cross-modal interaction, enabling more reliable prediction
of fine-grained dense depth. The predicted depth serves two purposes: 1) in an
image branch to guide the transformation of image features from perspective
view (PV) to a unified bird's-eye view (BEV) for multi-modal fusion, improving
spatial mapping accuracy; and 2) in a surface pseudo-point branch to generate
dense pseudo-point cloud, mitigating the radar point sparsity. The original
radar point cloud is also encoded in a separate radar branch. These two point
cloud branches adopt a pillar-based method and subsequently transform the
features into the BEV space. Finally, a standard 2D backbone and detection head
are used to predict object labels and bounding boxes from BEV features.
Experimental results show that SFGFusion effectively fuses camera and 4D radar
features, achieving superior performance on the TJ4DRadSet and view-of-delft
(VoD) object detection benchmarks.

a multi-frame temporal trajectory completion scheme centered on the Hungarian
algorithm for globally optimal cross-frame matching. To effectively mitigate
missing and false detections, a series of key steps including temporal matching

progressive trajectory refinement are designed in the post-processing pipeline.

Motivation: 解决车辆网络中带宽限制导致无法传输完整特征图的问题，同时克服现有前景中心方法丢弃背景上下文信息的局限性。

Method: 采用课程学习策略，早期利用背景线索但逐步修剪，强制模型将上下文信息内化到前景表示中，而不传输背景本身。

Result: 在模拟和真实世界基准测试中，FadeLead在不同带宽设置下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 上下文丰富的前景共享是协作感知的有效解决方案，能够在不传输背景的情况下保留重要上下文信息。

Abstract: Collaborative perception enhances the reliability and spatial coverage of
autonomous vehicles by sharing complementary information across vehicles,
offering a promising solution to long-tail scenarios that challenge
single-vehicle perception. However, the bandwidth constraints of vehicular
networks make transmitting the entire feature map impractical. Recent methods,
therefore, adopt a foreground-centric paradigm, transmitting only predicted
foreground-region features while discarding the background, which encodes
essential context. We propose FadeLead, a foreground-centric framework that
overcomes this limitation by learning to encapsulate background context into
compact foreground features during training. At the core of our design is a
curricular learning strategy that leverages background cues early on but
progressively prunes them away, forcing the model to internalize context into
foreground representations without transmitting background itself. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world benchmarks show that FadeLead
outperforms prior methods under different bandwidth settings, underscoring the
effectiveness of context-enriched foreground sharing.

Abstract: We present a survey on 4D generation and reconstruction, a fast-evolving
subfield of computer graphics whose developments have been propelled by recent
advances in neural fields, geometric and motion deep learning, as well 3D
generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). While our survey is not the first

focusing on representative works to highlight both the desirable properties and
ensuing challenges of each representation under different computation,
application, and data scenarios. The main take-away message we aim to convey to
the readers is on how to select and then customize the appropriate 4D
representations for their tasks. Organizationally, we separate the 4D
representations based on three key pillars: geometry, motion, and interaction.
Our discourse will not only encompass the most popular representations of
today, such as neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS),
but also bring attention to relatively under-explored representations in the 4D
context, such as structured models and long-range motions. Throughout our
survey, we will reprise the role of large language models (LLMs) and video
foundational models (VFMs) in a variety of 4D applications, while steering our
discussion towards their current limitations and how they can be addressed. We
also provide a dedicated coverage on what 4D datasets are currently available,
as well as what is lacking, in driving the subfield forward. Project

Conclusion: 提出的框架成功解决了单步扩散模型的结构失真问题，为真实图像超分辨率提供了质量与效率兼顾的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) must handle complex degradations
and inherent reconstruction ambiguities. While generative models have improved
perceptual quality, a key trade-off remains with computational cost. One-step
diffusion models offer speed but often produce structural inaccuracies due to
distillation artifacts. To address this, we propose a novel SR framework that
enhances a one-step diffusion model using a ControlNet mechanism for semantic
edge guidance. This integrates edge information to provide dynamic structural
control during single-pass inference. We also introduce a hybrid loss combining
L2, LPIPS, and an edge-aware AME loss to optimize for pixel accuracy,
perceptual quality, and geometric precision. Experiments show our method
effectively improves structural integrity and realism while maintaining the
efficiency of one-step generation, achieving a superior balance between output
quality and inference speed. The results of test datasets will be published at

*Zhang Nengbo,Ho Hann Woei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出轻量级MAV动作识别框架MobiAct，使用MobileNetV4作为骨干网络，结合知识蒸馏和参数自由注意力机制，在保持高精度的同时显著降低计算成本和能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MAV动作识别方法依赖计算密集型大模型，不适合资源受限的MAV平台，需要在识别精度和推理速度之间进行权衡。

Method: 采用MobileNetV4骨干网络，引入阶段式正交知识蒸馏(SOKD)策略从教师网络(ResNet18)向学生网络传递知识，集成参数自由注意力机制，并使用混合损失训练策略。

Result: 在三个自收集数据集上平均识别精度达92.12%，仅消耗136.16 pJ能量，处理速度为8.84动作/秒，动作解码速度比领先方法快2倍。

Conclusion: MobiAct实现了低能耗、低计算的MAV动作识别，在保持高精度的同时显著提升了效率，适合资源受限的MAV平台。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient recognition of Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) motion is
essential for enabling real-time perception and coordination in autonomous
aerial swarm. However, most existing approaches rely on large, computationally
intensive models that are unsuitable for resource-limited MAV platforms, which
results in a trade-off between recognition accuracy and inference speed. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight MAV action
recognition framework, MobiAct, designed to achieve high accuracy with low
computational cost. Specifically, MobiAct adopts MobileNetV4 as the backbone
network and introduces a Stage-wise Orthogonal Knowledge Distillation (SOKD)
strategy to effectively transfer MAV motion features from a teacher network
(ResNet18) to a student network, thereby enhancing knowledge transfer
efficiency. Furthermore, a parameter-free attention mechanism is integrated
into the architecture to improve recognition accuracy without increasing model
complexity. In addition, a hybrid loss training strategy is developed to
combine multiple loss objectives, which ensures stable and robust optimization
during training. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MobiAct
achieves low-energy and low-computation MAV action recognition, while
maintaining the fastest action decoding speed among compared methods. Across
all three self-collected datasets, MobiAct achieves an average recognition
accuracy of 92.12%, while consuming only 136.16 pJ of energy and processing
recognition at a rate of 8.84 actions per second. Notably, MobiAct decodes
actions up to 2 times faster than the leading method, with highly comparable
recognition accuracy, highlighting its superior efficiency in MAV action
recognition.

TL;DR: 提出D2D框架，将不可微的检测器转换为可微的批评器，利用其优越的计数能力来指导文本到图像生成模型生成正确数量的对象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常使用可微的回归模型作为辅助计数网络，但排除了计数能力更优越但不可微的检测器模型。

Method: 设计自定义激活函数将检测器logits转换为软二进制指示器，在推理时优化预训练T2I模型的噪声先验。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提高了对象计数准确率（如D2D-Small基准上提升13.7%），同时图像质量和计算开销几乎不受影响。

Conclusion: D2D框架成功地将不可微检测器的计数能力整合到T2I生成过程中，有效解决了对象数量生成问题。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved strong performance in
semantic alignment, yet they still struggle with generating the correct number
of objects specified in prompts. Existing approaches typically incorporate
auxiliary counting networks as external critics to enhance numeracy. However,
since these critics must provide gradient guidance during generation, they are
restricted to regression-based models that are inherently differentiable, thus
excluding detector-based models with superior counting ability, whose
count-via-enumeration nature is non-differentiable. To overcome this
limitation, we propose Detector-to-Differentiable (D2D), a novel framework that
transforms non-differentiable detection models into differentiable critics,
thereby leveraging their superior counting ability to guide numeracy
generation. Specifically, we design custom activation functions to convert
detector logits into soft binary indicators, which are then used to optimize
the noise prior at inference time with pre-trained T2I models. Our extensive
experiments on SDXL-Turbo, SD-Turbo, and Pixart-DMD across four benchmarks of
varying complexity (low-density, high-density, and multi-object scenarios)
demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements in object counting accuracy
(e.g., boosting up to 13.7% on D2D-Small, a 400-prompt, low-density benchmark),
with minimal degradation in overall image quality and computational overhead.

Abstract: Alzheimer disease is a severe brain disorder that causes harm in various
brain areas and leads to memory damage. The limited availability of labeled
medical data poses a significant challenge for accurate Alzheimer disease
detection. There is a critical need for effective methods to improve the
accuracy of Alzheimer disease detection, considering the scarcity of labeled
data, the complexity of the disease, and the constraints related to data
privacy. To address this challenge, our study leverages the power of big data
in the form of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) within the
framework of Few-Shot Learning (FSL) and ensemble learning. We propose an
ensemble approach based on a Prototypical Network (ProtoNet), a powerful method
in FSL, integrating various pre-trained CNNs as encoders. This integration
enhances the richness of features extracted from medical images. Our approach
also includes a combination of class-aware loss and entropy loss to ensure a
more precise classification of Alzheimer disease progression levels. The
effectiveness of our method was evaluated using two datasets, the Kaggle
Alzheimer dataset and the ADNI dataset, achieving an accuracy of 99.72% and
99.86%, respectively. The comparison of our results with relevant
state-of-the-art studies demonstrated that our approach achieved superior
accuracy and highlighted its validity and potential for real-world applications
in early Alzheimer disease detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型虽然取得了显著进展，但其大规模特性使其在资源受限环境中不实用，需要开发高效的训练算法来创建强大且轻量的视觉语言模型。

Method: RIL算法结合强化学习和对抗模仿学习，使用基于LLM的判别器区分学生和教师模型的输出，并利用多个大型教师VLM提供多样化指导。

Result: 在多个视觉语言基准测试上的广泛实验表明，RIL显著缩小了与最先进开源和闭源VLM的性能差距，并在多个实例中超越了它们。

Conclusion: 统一的强化和模仿学习策略使学生模型实现了显著的性能提升，使其能够与领先的闭源VLM竞争。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their
large scale often renders them impractical for resource-constrained
environments. This paper introduces Unified Reinforcement and Imitation
Learning (RIL), a novel and efficient training algorithm designed to create
powerful, lightweight VLMs. RIL distinctively combines the strengths of
reinforcement learning with adversarial imitation learning. This enables
smaller student VLMs not only to mimic the sophisticated text generation of
large teacher models but also to systematically improve their generative
capabilities through reinforcement signals. Key to our imitation framework is
an LLM-based discriminator that adeptly distinguishes between student and
teacher outputs, complemented by guidance from multiple large teacher VLMs to
ensure diverse learning. This unified learning strategy, leveraging both
reinforcement and imitation, empowers student models to achieve significant
performance gains, making them competitive with leading closed-source VLMs.
Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that
RIL significantly narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art open- and
closed-source VLMs and, in several instances, surpasses them.

Abstract: Handwritten signature verification is a crucial aspect of identity
authentication, with applications in various domains such as finance and
e-commerce. However, achieving high accuracy in signature verification remains
challenging due to intra-user variability and the risk of forgery. This paper
introduces a novel approach for dynamic signature verification: the
Temporal-Spatial Graph Attention Transformer (TS-GATR). TS-GATR combines the
Graph Attention Network (GAT) and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to model both
spatial and temporal dependencies in signature data. TS-GATR enhances
verification performance by representing signatures as graphs, where each node
captures dynamic features (e.g. position, velocity, pressure), and by using
attention mechanisms to model their complex relationships. The proposed method
further employs a Dual-Graph Attention Transformer (DGATR) module, which
utilizes k-step and k-nearest neighbor adjacency graphs to model local and
global spatial features, respectively. To capture long-term temporal
dependencies, the model integrates GRU, thereby enhancing its ability to learn
dynamic features during signature verification. Comprehensive experiments
conducted on benchmark datasets such as MSDS and DeepSignDB show that TS-GATR
surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches, consistently achieving lower
Equal Error Rates (EER) across various scenarios.

TL;DR: Seabed-Net是一个统一的多任务框架，同时从不同分辨率的遥感图像预测水深和基于像素的海底分类，通过跨任务特征融合和动态任务不确定性加权，显著提升了浅水环境测绘的精度。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的方法将水深估计和海底分类作为独立任务处理，忽略了它们之间的相互作用，限制了深度学习方法的广泛应用。需要一种能够同时处理这两个任务的统一框架。

Method: 采用双分支编码器分别处理水深估计和海底分类，通过注意力特征融合模块和窗口化Swin-Transformer融合块集成跨任务特征，并使用动态任务不确定性加权来平衡目标。

Result: 在两个异质沿海站点的广泛评估中，相比传统经验模型和机器学习回归方法，RMSE降低了75%；与最先进的单任务和多任务基线相比，水深RMSE降低了10-30%，海底分类精度提高了8%。

Conclusion: 联合建模水深与海底底质和栖息地能够产生协同增益，为集成浅水测绘提供了一个稳健的开放解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate, detailed, and regularly updated bathymetry, coupled with complex
semantic content, is essential for under-mapped shallow-water environments
facing increasing climatological and anthropogenic pressures. However, existing
approaches that derive either depth or seabed classes from remote sensing
imagery treat these tasks in isolation, forfeiting the mutual benefits of their
interaction and hindering the broader adoption of deep learning methods. To
address these limitations, we introduce Seabed-Net, a unified multi-task
framework that simultaneously predicts bathymetry and pixel-based seabed
classification from remote sensing imagery of various resolutions. Seabed-Net
employs dual-branch encoders for bathymetry estimation and pixel-based seabed
classification, integrates cross-task features via an Attention Feature Fusion
module and a windowed Swin-Transformer fusion block, and balances objectives
through dynamic task uncertainty weighting. In extensive evaluations at two
heterogeneous coastal sites, it consistently outperforms traditional empirical
models and traditional machine learning regression methods, achieving up to
75\% lower RMSE. It also reduces bathymetric RMSE by 10-30\% compared to
state-of-the-art single-task and multi-task baselines and improves seabed
classification accuracy up to 8\%. Qualitative analyses further demonstrate
enhanced spatial consistency, sharper habitat boundaries, and corrected depth
biases in low-contrast regions. These results confirm that jointly modeling
depth with both substrate and seabed habitats yields synergistic gains,
offering a robust, open solution for integrated shallow-water mapping. Code and
pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/pagraf/Seabed-Net.

Abstract: Crowd localization plays a crucial role in visual scene understanding towards
predicting each pedestrian location in a crowd, thus being applicable to
various downstream tasks. However, existing approaches suffer from significant
performance degradation due to discrepancies in head scale distributions (scale
shift) between training and testing data, a challenge known as domain
generalization (DG). This paper aims to comprehend the nature of scale shift
within the context of domain generalization for crowd localization models. To
this end, we address four critical questions: (i) How does scale shift
influence crowd localization in a DG scenario? (ii) How can we quantify this
influence? (iii) What causes this influence? (iv) How to mitigate the
influence? Initially, we conduct a systematic examination of how crowd
localization performance varies with different levels of scale shift. Then, we
establish a benchmark, ScaleBench, and reproduce 20 advanced DG algorithms to
quantify the influence. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the
limitations of existing algorithms and underscore the importance and complexity
of scale shift, a topic that remains insufficiently explored. To deepen our
understanding, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis on scale shift.
Building on these insights, we further propose an effective algorithm called
Causal Feature Decomposition and Anisotropic Processing (Catto) to mitigate the
influence of scale shift in DG settings. Later, we also provide extensive
analytical experiments, revealing four significant insights for future
research. Our results emphasize the importance of this novel and applicable
research direction, which we term Scale Shift Domain Generalization.

TL;DR: BrainMCLIP提出了一种参数高效的多层融合方法，将fMRI信号与CLIP的中间层和最终层对齐，无需额外的VAE管道即可实现竞争性图像重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将fMRI映射到CLIP的最终语义层，忽略了CLIP中间层的丰富物体信息，且与大脑功能层次结构不符。添加VAE管道会增加大量参数。

Method: 基于人类视觉系统功能层次结构，将不同视觉区域的fMRI信号对齐到对应的CLIP中间层和最终层，引入跨重建策略和多粒度损失函数。

Result: 在高级语义指标上达到或超越SOTA方法，参数减少71.7%，有效捕捉CLIP-only方法常遗漏的视觉细节。

Conclusion: BrainMCLIP在无需VAE管道的情况下，在语义准确性和细节保真度之间取得了良好平衡，证明了利用CLIP中间特征的有效性。

Abstract: Decoding images from fMRI often involves mapping brain activity to CLIP's
final semantic layer. To capture finer visual details, many approaches add a
parameter-intensive VAE-based pipeline. However, these approaches overlook rich
object information within CLIP's intermediate layers and contradicts the
brain's functionally hierarchical. We introduce BrainMCLIP, which pioneers a
parameter-efficient, multi-layer fusion approach guided by human visual
system's functional hierarchy, eliminating the need for such a separate VAE
pathway. BrainMCLIP aligns fMRI signals from functionally distinct visual areas
(low-/high-level) to corresponding intermediate and final CLIP layers,
respecting functional hierarchy. We further introduce a Cross-Reconstruction
strategy and a novel multi-granularity loss. Results show BrainMCLIP achieves
highly competitive performance, particularly excelling on high-level semantic
metrics where it matches or surpasses SOTA(state-of-the-art) methods, including
those using VAE pipelines. Crucially, it achieves this with substantially fewer
parameters, demonstrating a reduction of
71.7\%(Table.\ref{tab:compare_clip_vae}) compared to top VAE-based SOTA
methods, by avoiding the VAE pathway. By leveraging intermediate CLIP features,
it effectively captures visual details often missed by CLIP-only approaches,
striking a compelling balance between semantic accuracy and detail fidelity
without requiring a separate VAE pipeline.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel training-free framework for open-vocabulary image
segmentation and object recognition (OVSR), which leverages EfficientNetB0, a
convolutional neural network, for unsupervised segmentation and CLIP, a
vision-language model, for open-vocabulary object recognition. The proposed
framework adopts a two stage pipeline: unsupervised image segmentation followed
by segment-level recognition via vision-language alignment. In the first stage,
pixel-wise features extracted from EfficientNetB0 are decomposed using singular
value decomposition to obtain latent representations, which are then clustered
using hierarchical clustering to segment semantically meaningful regions. The
number of clusters is adaptively determined by the distribution of singular
values. In the second stage, the segmented regions are localized and encoded
into image embeddings using the Vision Transformer backbone of CLIP. Text
embeddings are precomputed using CLIP's text encoder from category-specific
prompts, including a generic something else prompt to support open set
recognition. The image and text embeddings are concatenated and projected into
a shared latent feature space via SVD to enhance cross-modal alignment.
Recognition is performed by computing the softmax over the similarities between
the projected image and text embeddings. The proposed method is evaluated on
standard benchmarks, including COCO, ADE20K, and PASCAL VOC, achieving
state-of-the-art performance in terms of Hungarian mIoU, precision, recall, and
F1-score. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, flexibility, and
generalizability of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Mobile Phone Agents (MPAs) have emerged as a promising research direction due
to their broad applicability across diverse scenarios. While Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) serve as the foundation for MPAs, their effectiveness
in handling multiple mobile phone tasks simultaneously remains limited.
Although multitask supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely adopted for multitask
learning, existing approaches struggle to determine optimal training data
compositions for peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose DaMo
(Data Mixture Optimizer) - a novel solution employing a trainable network that
predicts optimal data mixtures by forecasting downstream task performance for
any given dataset ratio. To support comprehensive evaluation, we introduce
PhoneAgentBench, the first specialized benchmark to evaluate MLLMs on
multimodal mobile phone tasks, comprising 1235 QA pairs spanning diverse
real-world industrial mobile application scenarios. Demonstrating strong
predictive capability (R^2=0.81) in small-scale pilot experiments, DaMo
efficiently extrapolates optimal data mixing configurations. Our results show
DaMo achieves a 3.38% performance improvement on PhoneAgentBench compared to
alternative methods. Furthermore, extensive experiments across established
benchmarks including BFCL-v3, MME-Reasoning, MME-Perception, and OCRBench
reveal DaMo's superior generalization, outperforming other approaches by 2.57%
in terms of average score. When used solely for MLLM optimization on the
BFCL-v3 task, DaMo improves the metrics by 12.47% than other methods. Notably,
DaMo maintains robust scalability, preserving its effectiveness when applied to
other model architectures. The code and dataset are available at

Abstract: Deformable medical image registration is a fundamental task in medical image
analysis. While deep learning-based methods have demonstrated superior accuracy
and computational efficiency compared to traditional techniques, they often
overlook the critical role of regularization in ensuring robustness and
anatomical plausibility. We propose DARE (Deformable Adaptive Regularization
Estimator), a novel registration framework that dynamically adjusts elastic
regularization based on the gradient norm of the deformation field. Our
approach integrates strain and shear energy terms, which are adaptively
modulated to balance stability and flexibility. To ensure physically realistic

TL;DR: AegisRF通过注入对抗性扰动来保护NeRF模型的知识产权，同时使用可学习的敏感度场来保持渲染质量，防止几何变形。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着NeRF在3D场景表示和新视角合成中的广泛应用，保护其知识产权免受未经授权使用变得至关重要。现有方法避免几何扰动或限制在显式空间中，因为这会破坏场景结构并降低渲染质量。

Method: 提出了AegisRF框架，包含扰动场和敏感度场。扰动场在NeRF预渲染输出中注入对抗性扰动以欺骗下游目标模型；敏感度场学习空间变化的敏感度来自适应约束几何扰动，在保持渲染质量的同时破坏未经授权的使用。

Result: 实验评估表明AegisRF在多种下游任务和模态中具有通用适用性，包括多视角图像分类和基于体素的3D定位，同时保持高视觉保真度。

Conclusion: AegisRF有效地保护了NeRF模型的知识产权，通过自适应约束几何扰动在保持渲染质量的同时破坏未经授权的下游应用。

Abstract: As Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a powerful tool for 3D
scene representation and novel view synthesis, protecting their intellectual
property (IP) from unauthorized use is becoming increasingly crucial. In this
work, we aim to protect the IP of NeRFs by injecting adversarial perturbations
that disrupt their unauthorized applications. However, perturbing the 3D
geometry of NeRFs can easily deform the underlying scene structure and thus
substantially degrade the rendering quality, which has led existing attempts to
avoid geometric perturbations or restrict them to explicit spaces like meshes.
To overcome this limitation, we introduce a learnable sensitivity to quantify
the spatially varying impact of geometric perturbations on rendering quality.
Building upon this, we propose AegisRF, a novel framework that consists of a
Perturbation Field, which injects adversarial perturbations into the
pre-rendering outputs (color and volume density) of NeRF models to fool an
unauthorized downstream target model, and a Sensitivity Field, which learns the
sensitivity to adaptively constrain geometric perturbations, preserving
rendering quality while disrupting unauthorized use. Our experimental
evaluations demonstrate the generalized applicability of AegisRF across diverse
downstream tasks and modalities, including multi-view image classification and
voxel-based 3D localization, while maintaining high visual fidelity. Codes are
available at https://github.com/wkim97/AegisRF.

TL;DR: MV-RoboBench是一个专门评估视觉语言模型在多视角机器人操作中空间推理能力的基准，包含1.7k个手动标注的QA项目，涵盖空间理解和机器人执行两个主要类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLM评估主要关注单视角设置，而多摄像头配置在机器人平台中日益标准化，需要评估VLM是否能有效利用多视角输入进行机器人推理。

Method: 构建MV-RoboBench基准，包含8个子任务的1.7k个手动标注QA项目，评估开源和闭源VLM模型，以及结合CoT技术的增强版本。

Result: 最先进模型性能远低于人类水平，发现空间智能与机器人任务执行在多视角场景中正相关，且单视角基准的强性能不能可靠转化为机器人空间任务的成功。

Conclusion: VLM在多视角机器人感知中面临重大挑战，MV-RoboBench作为开放资源将促进空间基础VLM和VLA的发展。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential to Embodied AI, enabling robots
to perceive, reason, and act in complex environments. They also serve as the
foundation for the recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Yet most
evaluations of VLMs focus on single-view settings, leaving their ability to
integrate multi-view information underexplored. At the same time, multi-camera
setups are increasingly standard in robotic platforms, as they provide
complementary perspectives to mitigate occlusion and depth ambiguity. Whether
VLMs can effectively leverage such multi-view inputs for robotic reasoning
therefore remains an open question. To bridge this gap, we introduce
MV-RoboBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the multi-view
spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in robotic manipulation. MV-RoboBench
consists of 1.7k manually curated QA items across eight subtasks, divided into
two primary categories: spatial understanding and robotic execution. We
evaluate a diverse set of existing VLMs, including both open-source and
closed-source models, along with enhanced versions incorporating CoT-inspired
techniques. The results show that state-of-the-art models remain far below
human performance, underscoring the substantial challenges VLMs face in
multi-view robotic perception. Additionally, our analysis uncovers two key
findings: (i) spatial intelligence and robotic task execution are positively
correlated in multi-view robotic scenarios; and (ii) strong performance on
existing general-purpose single-view spatial understanding benchmarks does not
reliably translate to success in the robotic spatial tasks assessed by our
benchmark. We release MV-RoboBench as an open resource to foster progress in
spatially grounded VLMs and VLAs, providing not only data but also a
standardized evaluation protocol for multi-view embodied reasoning.

Method: 在仓库天花板上安装19个广角摄像头俯视地面，基于地板表面对齐摄像头坐标与实际位置关系。通过检测工人脚部位置进行坐标对齐，减少广角镜头边缘失真影响。

Result: 确认追踪精度提高了20%以上，并通过比较多种外观特征利用方法验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于脚部位置的多摄像头坐标对齐方法能有效减少广角镜头失真，显著提高工人追踪精度，为物流仓库数字孪生系统提供了可行的技术方案。

Abstract: With the spread of e-commerce, the logistics market is growing around the
world. Therefore, improving the efficiency of warehouse operations is
essential. To achieve this, various approaches have been explored, and among
them, the use of digital twins is gaining attention. To make this approach
possible, it is necessary to accurately collect the positions of workers in a
warehouse and reflect them in a virtual space. However, a single camera has
limitations in its field of view, therefore sensing with multiple cameras is
necessary. In this study, we explored a method to track workers using 19
wide-angle cameras installed on the ceiling, looking down at the floor of the
logistics warehouse. To understand the relationship between the camera
coordinates and the actual positions in the warehouse, we performed alignment
based on the floor surface. However, due to the characteristics of wide-angle
cameras, significant distortion occurs at the edges of the image, particularly
in the vertical direction. To address this, the detected worker positions from
each camera were aligned based on foot positions, reducing the effects of image
distortion, and enabling accurate position alignment across cameras. As a
result, we confirmed an improvement of over 20% in tracking accuracy.
Furthermore, we compared multiple methods for utilizing appearance features and
validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在客观感知任务中表现出色，但在主观情感领域如心理分析中的应用尚未充分探索，特别是在房树人测试等临床心理评估中。

Method: 将多实例绘画分解为语义子图，构建三层层次表示；引入房树人知识库和特征提取模块；使用强化学习生成心理画像；整合多层面信息进行综合评估。

Result: 实验结果表明PICK显著提升了多模态大语言模型在心理分析中的能力，并在情感理解任务中得到验证。

Conclusion: PICK填补了多模态大语言模型与专业领域之间的空白，为通过视觉表达理解人类心理状态提供了结构化、可解释的框架。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional
performance across various objective multimodal perception tasks, yet their
application to subjective, emotionally nuanced domains, such as psychological
analysis, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce PICK, a
multi-step framework designed for Psychoanalytical Image Comprehension through
hierarchical analysis and Knowledge injection with MLLMs, specifically focusing
on the House-Tree-Person (HTP) Test, a widely used psychological assessment in
clinical practice. First, we decompose drawings containing multiple instances
into semantically meaningful sub-drawings, constructing a hierarchical
representation that captures spatial structure and content across three levels:
single-object level, multi-object level, and whole level. Next, we analyze
these sub-drawings at each level with a targeted focus, extracting
psychological or emotional insights from their visual cues. We also introduce
an HTP knowledge base and design a feature extraction module, trained with
reinforcement learning, to generate a psychological profile for single-object
level analysis. This profile captures both holistic stylistic features and
dynamic object-specific features (such as those of the house, tree, or person),
correlating them with psychological states. Finally, we integrate these
multi-faceted information to produce a well-informed assessment that aligns
with expert-level reasoning. Our approach bridges the gap between MLLMs and
specialized expert domains, offering a structured and interpretable framework
for understanding human mental states through visual expression. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed PICK significantly enhances the
capability of MLLMs in psychological analysis. It is further validated as a
general framework through extensions to emotion understanding tasks.

TL;DR: 本文针对IC缺陷分类中真实世界数据高度不平衡的问题，提出了IC-Defect-14数据集和ReCAME-Net模型，通过多专家分类器框架结合区域通道注意力、度量学习等技术，有效解决了类内多样性和类间相似性的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实IC缺陷分类面临两个主要挑战：1) IC行业高良率要求导致数据分布比公开不平衡数据集更加倾斜；2) 真实样本同时包含类特定属性和类无关的领域相关特征，增加了分类难度。现有方法在真实场景中表现不佳。

Method: 提出ReCAME-Net模型，采用多专家分类器框架，集成了区域通道注意力模块、度量学习损失、困难类别挖掘策略和知识蒸馏过程，专门针对IC-Defect-14数据集的类内聚类特性进行优化。

Result: 在IC-Defect-14数据集上的大量实验评估表明，ReCAME-Net超越了之前的最先进模型，同时在通用公共数据集上保持了可比的性能和竞争力。

Conclusion: ReCAME-Net成功解决了真实IC缺陷分类中的高度不平衡数据挑战，特别是在处理类内多样性和类间相似性方面表现出色，为工业应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in deep classification techniques and in-lab
automatic optical inspection models for long-tailed or highly imbalanced data,
applying these approaches to real-world IC defect classification tasks remains
challenging. This difficulty stems from two primary factors. First, real-world
conditions, such as the high yield-rate requirements in the IC industry, result
in data distributions that are far more skewed than those found in general
public imbalanced datasets. Consequently, classifiers designed for open
imbalanced datasets often fail to perform effectively in real-world scenarios.
Second, real-world samples exhibit a mix of class-specific attributes and
class-agnostic, domain-related features. This complexity adds significant
difficulty to the classification process, particularly for highly imbalanced
datasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the IC-Defect-14
dataset, a large, highly imbalanced IC defect image dataset sourced from AOI
systems deployed in real-world IC production lines. This dataset is
characterized by its unique "intra-class clusters" property, which presents two
major challenges: large intra-class diversity and high inter-class similarity.
These characteristics, rarely found simultaneously in existing public datasets,
significantly degrade the performance of current state-of-the-art classifiers
for highly imbalanced data. To tackle this challenge, we propose ReCAME-Net,
which follows a multi-expert classifier framework and integrates a regional
channel attention module, metric learning losses, a hard category mining
strategy, and a knowledge distillation procedure. Extensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate that ReCAME-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art
models on the IC-Defect-14 dataset while maintaining comparable performance and
competitiveness on general public datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决地下表征中孔隙尺度图像代表性不足的问题，因为自然空间异质性导致提取的子图像与岩心测量值显著偏离，同时面临数据稀缺的挑战。

Method: 使用多条件生成对抗网络(cGAN)框架，在碳酸盐岩地层薄片样本上训练，同时以孔隙度值和深度参数作为条件输入，捕捉通用孔隙网络原理和深度特定地质特征。

Result: 模型在所有地层中实现了出色的孔隙度控制(R^2=0.95)，平均绝对误差为0.0099-0.0197。生成的图像显示出优越的代表性，双约束误差为1.9-11.3%，而随机提取的真实子图像误差为36.4-578%。

Conclusion: 该框架为地下表征提供了变革性工具，特别适用于碳储存、地热能源和地下水管理等应用，其中了解孔隙空间的代表性形态对实施数字岩石物理至关重要。

Abstract: Obtaining truly representative pore-scale images that match bulk formation
properties remains a fundamental challenge in subsurface characterization, as
natural spatial heterogeneity causes extracted sub-images to deviate
significantly from core-measured values. This challenge is compounded by data
scarcity, where physical samples are only available at sparse well locations.
This study presents a multi-conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)
framework that generates representative pore-scale images with precisely
controlled properties, addressing both the representativeness challenge and
data availability constraints. The framework was trained on thin section
samples from four depths (1879.50-1943.50 m) of a carbonate formation,
simultaneously conditioning on porosity values and depth parameters within a
single unified model. This approach captures both universal pore network
principles and depth-specific geological characteristics, from grainstone
fabrics with interparticle-intercrystalline porosity to crystalline textures
with anhydrite inclusions. The model achieved exceptional porosity control
(R^2=0.95) across all formations with mean absolute errors of 0.0099-0.0197.
Morphological validation confirmed preservation of critical pore network
characteristics including average pore radius, specific surface area, and
tortuosity, with statistical differences remaining within acceptable geological
tolerances. Most significantly, generated images demonstrated superior
representativeness with dual-constraint errors of 1.9-11.3% compared to
36.4-578% for randomly extracted real sub-images. This capability provides
transformative tools for subsurface characterization, particularly valuable for
carbon storage, geothermal energy, and groundwater management applications
where knowing the representative morphology of the pore space is critical for
implementing digital rock physics.

Motivation: MRI采集时间过长限制了临床吞吐量，需要新的方法来加速MRI扫描过程。

Method: 开发了一个预测-先验重建框架，使用生成模型基于多种数据源（其他对比度图像、历史扫描图像、采集参数、患者信息）预测目标对比度图像，然后将其作为数据驱动先验来重建高度欠采样的数据。

Result: 在内部和多个公共数据集（总计14,921次扫描；1,051,904个切片）上评估，包括多通道k空间数据，在x4、x8和x12高加速因子下，该方法显著优于其他方法，包括使用替代或无先验信息的方法。

Conclusion: 该框架引入了从图像重建向预测性成像新范式的根本转变，为MRI加速提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have created transformative
capabilities in image synthesis and generation, enabling diverse research
fields to innovate at revolutionary speed and spectrum. In this study, we
leverage this generative power to introduce a new paradigm for accelerating
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), introducing a shift from image reconstruction
to proactive predictive imaging. Despite being a cornerstone of modern patient
care, MRI's lengthy acquisition times limit clinical throughput. Our novel
framework addresses this challenge by first predicting a target contrast image,
which then serves as a data-driven prior for reconstructing highly
under-sampled data. This informative prior is predicted by a generative model
conditioned on diverse data sources, such as other contrast images, previously
scanned images, acquisition parameters, patient information. We demonstrate
this approach with two key applications: (1) reconstructing FLAIR images using
predictions from T1w and/or T2w scans, and (2) reconstructing T1w images using
predictions from previously acquired T1w scans. The framework was evaluated on
internal and multiple public datasets (total 14,921 scans; 1,051,904 slices),
including multi-channel k-space data, for a range of high acceleration factors
(x4, x8 and x12). The results demonstrate that our prediction-prior
reconstruction method significantly outperforms other approaches, including
those with alternative or no prior information. Through this framework we
introduce a fundamental shift from image reconstruction towards a new paradigm
of predictive imaging.

Motivation: 现有视频方法孤立处理序列，未能利用跨序列的结构规律和重复运动模式，限制了3D姿态估计的性能提升。

Method: 提出PRGCN框架，包含图记忆库存储姿态原型、注意力检索机制、记忆驱动图卷积融合解剖约束，以及Mamba与自注意力结合的双流架构。

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP上分别达到37.1mm和13.4mm的MPJPE，展现了优越的跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: 跨序列模式重用是推动领域发展的关键机制，将范式从单序列优化转向累积知识学习。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a fundamentally ill-posed inverse
problem due to the inherent depth ambiguity in 2D-to-3D lifting. While
contemporary video-based methods leverage temporal context to enhance spatial
reasoning, they operate under a critical paradigm limitation: processing each
sequence in isolation, thereby failing to exploit the strong structural
regularities and repetitive motion patterns that pervade human movement across
sequences. This work introduces the Pattern Reuse Graph Convolutional Network
(PRGCN), a novel framework that formalizes pose estimation as a problem of
pattern retrieval and adaptation. At its core, PRGCN features a graph memory
bank that learns and stores a compact set of pose prototypes, encoded as
relational graphs, which are dynamically retrieved via an attention mechanism
to provide structured priors. These priors are adaptively fused with hard-coded
anatomical constraints through a memory-driven graph convolution, ensuring
geometrical plausibility. To underpin this retrieval process with robust
spatiotemporal features, we design a dual-stream hybrid architecture that
synergistically combines the linear-complexity, local temporal modeling of
Mamba-based state-space models with the global relational capacity of
self-attention. Extensive evaluations on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP benchmarks
demonstrate that PRGCN establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an MPJPE
of 37.1mm and 13.4mm, respectively, while exhibiting enhanced cross-domain
generalization capability. Our work posits that the long-overlooked mechanism
of cross-sequence pattern reuse is pivotal to advancing the field, shifting the
paradigm from per-sequence optimization towards cumulative knowledge learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星图像因云层等因素存在系统性缺失像素，这些缺失数据会导致自动化特征提取模型产生表示偏差，特别是在甲烷羽流检测中，模型可能错误地将图像覆盖率与标签关联起来。

Method: 评估了多种插补方法，并提出在训练期间使用加权重采样方案，通过在每个覆盖率区间内强制类别平衡来消除标签与覆盖率之间的关联。

Result: 重采样和插补方法都能显著减少表示偏差，同时不会损害平衡准确率、精确率或召回率。去偏模型在低覆盖率图像中检测羽流的能力更强。

Conclusion: 提出的去偏技术能有效提高模型在低覆盖率图像中的检测性能，对卫星图像分析具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Most satellite images have systematically missing pixels (i.e., missing data
not at random (MNAR)) due to factors such as clouds. If not addressed, these
missing pixels can lead to representation bias in automated feature extraction
models. In this work, we show that spurious association between the label and
the number of missing values in methane plume detection can cause the model to
associate the coverage (i.e., the percentage of valid pixels in an image) with
the label, subsequently under-detecting plumes in low-coverage images. We
evaluate multiple imputation approaches to remove the dependence between the
coverage and a label. Additionally, we propose a weighted resampling scheme
during training that removes the association between the label and the coverage
by enforcing class balance in each coverage bin. Our results show that both
resampling and imputation can significantly reduce the representation bias
without hurting balanced accuracy, precision, or recall. Finally, we evaluate
the capability of the debiased models using these techniques in an operational
scenario and demonstrate that the debiased models have a higher chance of
detecting plumes in low-coverage images.

Result: 在SDGOD数据集上，Cauvis相比现有域泛化方法实现了15.9-31.4%的性能提升，并在复杂干扰环境中展现出显著的鲁棒性优势。

Conclusion: Cauvis方法有效解决了单源域泛化目标检测中的伪相关性问题，通过因果视觉提示机制实现了优异的泛化性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Single-source Domain Generalized Object Detection (SDGOD), as a cutting-edge
research topic in computer vision, aims to enhance model generalization
capability in unseen target domains through single-source domain training.
Current mainstream approaches attempt to mitigate domain discrepancies via data
augmentation techniques. However, due to domain shift and limited
domain-specific knowledge, models tend to fall into the pitfall of spurious
correlations. This manifests as the model's over-reliance on simplistic
classification features (e.g., color) rather than essential domain-invariant
representations like object contours. To address this critical challenge, we
propose the Cauvis (Causal Visual Prompts) method. First, we introduce a
Cross-Attention Prompts module that mitigates bias from spurious features by
integrating visual prompts with cross-attention. To address the inadequate
domain knowledge coverage and spurious feature entanglement in visual prompts
for single-domain generalization, we propose a dual-branch adapter that
disentangles causal-spurious features while achieving domain adaptation via
high-frequency feature extraction. Cauvis achieves state-of-the-art performance
with 15.9-31.4% gains over existing domain generalization methods on SDGOD
datasets, while exhibiting significant robustness advantages in complex
interference environments.

Conclusion: CARES通过智能选择最小足够分辨率，有效解决了VLM中视觉token过多导致的计算效率问题，实现了性能与效率的良好平衡。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) commonly process images at native or high
resolution to remain effective across tasks. This inflates visual tokens ofter
to 97-99% of total tokens, resulting in high compute and latency, even when
low-resolution images would suffice. We introduce \emph{CARES}-a
\textbf{C}ontext-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{R}esolution \textbf{S}elector, a
lightweight preprocessing module that, given an image-query pair, predicts the
\emph{minimal} sufficient input resolution. CARES uses a compact VLM (350M) to
extract features and predict when a target pretrained VLM's response converges
to its peak ability to answer correctly. Though trained as a discrete
classifier over a set of optional resolutions, CARES interpolates continuous
resolutions at inference for fine-grained control. Across five multimodal
benchmarks spanning documents and natural images, as well as diverse target

Conclusion: PoseCrafter通过改进中间帧生成和选择策略，有效解决了稀疏重叠图像对的相机位姿估计难题

Abstract: Pairwise camera pose estimation from sparsely overlapping image pairs remains
a critical and unsolved challenge in 3D vision. Most existing methods struggle
with image pairs that have small or no overlap. Recent approaches attempt to
address this by synthesizing intermediate frames using video interpolation and
selecting key frames via a self-consistency score. However, the generated
frames are often blurry due to small overlap inputs, and the selection
strategies are slow and not explicitly aligned with pose estimation. To solve
these cases, we propose Hybrid Video Generation (HVG) to synthesize clearer
intermediate frames by coupling a video interpolation model with a
pose-conditioned novel view synthesis model, where we also propose a Feature
Matching Selector (FMS) based on feature correspondence to select intermediate
frames appropriate for pose estimation from the synthesized results. Extensive
experiments on Cambridge Landmarks, ScanNet, DL3DV-10K, and NAVI demonstrate
that, compared to existing SOTA methods, PoseCrafter can obviously enhance the
pose estimation performances, especially on examples with small or no overlap.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了视觉语言模型在计数任务中的局限性，发现模型对物体数量、类型、空间排列和干扰物高度敏感，通过仅微调输出层可将准确率提升高达21%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在下游任务中表现优异，但在视觉推理方面仍存在局限，特别是在识别关系、理解时间序列和计数对象方面。本研究旨在深入分析这些失败的根本原因并针对性提升其推理能力。

Method: 在受控实验条件下研究了7个最先进视觉语言模型的计数能力，进行分层分析，并通过仅微调输出层进行针对性训练。

Result: 实验表明视觉语言模型对物体数量、类型、空间排列和干扰物高度敏感。分层分析显示错误源于最后一层表示到输出空间的映射不正确。仅微调输出层可将准确率提升高达21%，在真实数据集上也获得了一致的改进。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型的计数能力缺陷主要源于输出映射问题，通过针对性微调输出层可以显著改善模型性能，这为提升视觉语言模型的推理能力提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently gained attention due to their
competitive performance on multiple downstream tasks, achieved by following
user-input instructions. However, VLMs still exhibit several limitations in
visual reasoning, such as difficulties in identifying relations (e.g., spatial,
temporal, and among objects), understanding temporal sequences (e.g., frames),
and counting objects. In this work, we go beyond score-level benchmark
evaluations of VLMs by investigating the underlying causes of their failures
and proposing a targeted approach to improve their reasoning capabilities. We
study the reasoning skills of seven state-of-the-art VLMs in the counting task
under controlled experimental conditions. Our experiments show that VLMs are
highly sensitive to the number and type of objects, their spatial arrangement,
and the co-occurrence of distractors. A layer-wise analysis reveals that errors
are due to incorrect mapping of the last-layer representation into the output
space. Our targeted training shows that fine-tuning just the output layer
improves accuracy by up to 21%. We corroborate these findings by achieving
consistent improvements on real-world datasets.

*Xiaofeng Zhang,Aaron Courville,Michal Drozdzal,Adriana Romero-Soriano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了文本到图像（T2I）模型中提示复杂度对合成数据质量、多样性和一致性的系统影响，发现增加提示复杂度会降低条件多样性和提示一致性，但减少合成与真实数据的分布偏移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然T2I模型能生成无限的合成数据，但提示工程作为主要交互方式，其复杂度对合成数据效用的系统影响尚未充分探索。

Method: 首先进行合成实验验证提示复杂度泛化的困难性，然后提出新的评估框架比较真实数据和合成数据的效用，并在CC12M、ImageNet-1k和DCI等数据集上分析不同T2I模型的效用。

Result: 增加提示复杂度导致条件多样性和提示一致性降低，但减少合成与真实数据的分布偏移。提示扩展方法在图像多样性和美学方面表现最佳，甚至超过真实数据。

Conclusion: 提示复杂度对合成数据效用有显著影响，当前推理时干预方法能在牺牲真实数据支持的情况下增强多样性，其中提示扩展方法表现最优。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models offer great potential for creating virtually
limitless synthetic data, a valuable resource compared to fixed and finite real
datasets. Previous works evaluate the utility of synthetic data from T2I models
on three key desiderata: quality, diversity, and consistency. While prompt
engineering is the primary means of interacting with T2I models, the systematic
impact of prompt complexity on these critical utility axes remains
underexplored. In this paper, we first conduct synthetic experiments to
motivate the difficulty of generalization w.r.t. prompt complexity and explain
the observed difficulty with theoretical derivations. Then, we introduce a new
evaluation framework that can compare the utility of real data and synthetic
data, and present a comprehensive analysis of how prompt complexity influences
the utility of synthetic data generated by commonly used T2I models. We conduct
our study across diverse datasets, including CC12M, ImageNet-1k, and DCI, and
evaluate different inference-time intervention methods. Our synthetic
experiments show that generalizing to more general conditions is harder than
the other way round, since the former needs an estimated likelihood that is not
learned by diffusion models. Our large-scale empirical experiments reveal that
increasing prompt complexity results in lower conditional diversity and prompt
consistency, while reducing the synthetic-to-real distribution shift, which
aligns with the synthetic experiments. Moreover, current inference-time
interventions can augment the diversity of the generations at the expense of
moving outside the support of real data. Among those interventions, prompt
expansion, by deliberately using a pre-trained language model as a likelihood
estimator, consistently achieves the highest performance in both image
diversity and aesthetics, even higher than that of real data.

Motivation: 研究视觉语言模型是否能够理解视觉内容的时间定位能力，评估其时间感知性能。

Method: 引入TIME10k基准数据集（包含10,000多张带时间标注的图像），评估37个VLM的时间感知能力，并提出从嵌入空间提取显式时间线表示的方法。

Result: 发现时间信息在VLM嵌入空间中呈低维非线性流形结构，提出的时间线方法在准确率上优于基于提示的基线方法，且计算效率高。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型具有内在的时间感知能力，可以通过嵌入空间中的时间流形结构进行时间推理任务。

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have gained popularity
for their generalizable and expressive multimodal representations. By
leveraging large-scale training data with diverse textual metadata, VLMs
acquire open-vocabulary capabilities, solving tasks beyond their training
scope. This paper investigates the temporal awareness of VLMs, assessing their
ability to position visual content in time. We introduce TIME10k, a benchmark
dataset of over 10,000 images with temporal ground truth, and evaluate the
time-awareness of 37 VLMs by a novel methodology. Our investigation reveals
that temporal information is structured along a low-dimensional, non-linear
manifold in the VLM embedding space. Based on this insight, we propose methods
to derive an explicit ``timeline'' representation from the embedding space.
These representations model time and its chronological progression and thereby
facilitate temporal reasoning tasks. Our timeline approaches achieve
competitive to superior accuracy compared to a prompt-based baseline while
being computationally efficient. All code and data are available at

TL;DR: 提出了HAD（分层非对称蒸馏）框架，通过分层对齐策略解决RGB相机和事件相机之间的时空不对称问题，提升多模态目标跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB相机和事件相机具有互补优势（RGB提供高空间分辨率和纹理细节，事件相机提供高时间分辨率和动态范围），但两者成像机制不同导致显著的时空不对称，阻碍了有效的多模态融合。

Method: 提出分层非对称蒸馏（HAD）框架，采用分层对齐策略，在保持学生网络计算效率和参数紧凑性的同时最小化信息损失。

Result: 大量实验表明HAD持续优于最先进方法，全面的消融研究验证了每个设计组件的有效性和必要性。

Conclusion: HAD框架成功解决了RGB和事件相机之间的时空不对称问题，显著提升了多模态目标跟踪性能。

Abstract: RGB cameras excel at capturing rich texture details with high spatial
resolution, whereas event cameras offer exceptional temporal resolution and a
high dynamic range (HDR). Leveraging their complementary strengths can
substantially enhance object tracking under challenging conditions, such as
high-speed motion, HDR environments, and dynamic background interference.
However, a significant spatio-temporal asymmetry exists between these two
modalities due to their fundamentally different imaging mechanisms, hindering
effective multi-modal integration. To address this issue, we propose
{Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation} (HAD), a multi-modal knowledge
distillation framework that explicitly models and mitigates spatio-temporal
asymmetries. Specifically, HAD proposes a hierarchical alignment strategy that
minimizes information loss while maintaining the student network's
computational efficiency and parameter compactness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and
comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and necessity
of each designed component. The code will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: α-Cloak是首个针对视频目标检测器的无盒对抗攻击，通过RGBA视频的alpha通道将恶意视频与良性视频融合，使融合视频对人眼无害但能持续欺骗目标检测器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着目标检测模型在自动驾驶车辆和监控平台等网络物理系统中的广泛应用，确保其对抗性威胁的安全性至关重要。现有研究主要关注图像域的对抗攻击，而视频域的攻击，特别是在无盒设置下的攻击，尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 利用RGBA视频的alpha通道将恶意目标视频与良性视频融合，设计融合算法确保视觉隐蔽性和兼容性，无需访问模型架构、参数或输出。

Result: 在五种最先进的目标检测器、一个视觉语言模型和一个多模态大语言模型上评估，攻击成功率在所有场景下均达到100%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了视频感知系统中一个先前未被探索的漏洞，强调了在对抗性设置中考虑alpha通道的防御措施的紧迫需求。

Abstract: As object detection models are increasingly deployed in cyber-physical
systems such as autonomous vehicles (AVs) and surveillance platforms, ensuring
their security against adversarial threats is essential. While prior work has
explored adversarial attacks in the image domain, those attacks in the video
domain remain largely unexamined, especially in the no-box setting. In this
paper, we present {\alpha}-Cloak, the first no-box adversarial attack on object
detectors that operates entirely through the alpha channel of RGBA videos.
{\alpha}-Cloak exploits the alpha channel to fuse a malicious target video with
a benign video, resulting in a fused video that appears innocuous to human
viewers but consistently fools object detectors. Our attack requires no access
to model architecture, parameters, or outputs, and introduces no perceptible
artifacts. We systematically study the support for alpha channels across common
video formats and playback applications, and design a fusion algorithm that
ensures visual stealth and compatibility. We evaluate {\alpha}-Cloak on five
state-of-the-art object detectors, a vision-language model, and a multi-modal
large language model (Gemini-2.0-Flash), demonstrating a 100% attack success
rate across all scenarios. Our findings reveal a previously unexplored
vulnerability in video-based perception systems, highlighting the urgent need
for defenses that account for the alpha channel in adversarial settings.

Method: 设计轻量级VGGT变体从预训练模型中提取几何先验，构建高斯头融合多尺度几何tokens预测新视角渲染的高斯参数，集成多尺度几何和高斯头特征联合监督语义细化模型

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的实验表明，该方法在各种设置下客观指标和主观质量均显著优于现有最优方法

Conclusion: VGD框架验证了其在环视重建中的可扩展性和高保真度，通过几何引导的语义优化有效解决了环视场景重建的关键挑战

Abstract: Feed-forward surround-view autonomous driving scene reconstruction offers
fast, generalizable inference ability, which faces the core challenge of
ensuring generalization while elevating novel view quality. Due to the
surround-view with minimal overlap regions, existing methods typically fail to
ensure geometric consistency and reconstruction quality for novel views. To
tackle this tension, we claim that geometric information must be learned
explicitly, and the resulting features should be leveraged to guide the
elevating of semantic quality in novel views. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{Visual Gaussian Driving (VGD)}, a novel feed-forward end-to-end
learning framework designed to address this challenge. To achieve generalizable
geometric estimation, we design a lightweight variant of the VGGT architecture
to efficiently distill its geometric priors from the pre-trained VGGT to the
geometry branch. Furthermore, we design a Gaussian Head that fuses multi-scale
geometry tokens to predict Gaussian parameters for novel view rendering, which
shares the same patch backbone as the geometry branch. Finally, we integrate
multi-scale features from both geometry and Gaussian head branches to jointly
supervise a semantic refinement model, optimizing rendering quality through
feature-consistent learning. Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both objective
metrics and subjective quality under various settings, which validates VGD's
scalability and high-fidelity surround-view reconstruction.

Motivation: 地球观测领域存在大量多模态数据，但在实际应用中训练和推理阶段可能无法访问相同的传感器模态。多模态协同学习可以利用训练阶段的大量传感器数据来改进推理阶段的单模态模型。

Method: 结合对比学习和模态判别学习，引导单模态模型将内部模型流形结构化为模态共享和模态特定信息。

Conclusion: 该框架在多种地球观测应用的单模态推理场景中表现出有效性，验证了其通用性和实用性。

Abstract: Multi-modal co-learning is emerging as an effective paradigm in machine
learning, enabling models to collaboratively learn from different modalities to
enhance single-modality predictions. Earth Observation (EO) represents a
quintessential domain for multi-modal data analysis, wherein diverse remote
sensors collect data to sense our planet. This unprecedented volume of data
introduces novel challenges. Specifically, the access to the same sensor
modalities at both training and inference stages becomes increasingly complex
based on real-world constraints affecting remote sensing platforms. In this
context, multi-modal co-learning presents a promising strategy to leverage the
vast amount of sensor-derived data available at the training stage to improve
single-modality models for inference-time deployment. Most current research
efforts focus on designing customized solutions for either particular
downstream tasks or specific modalities available at the inference stage. To
address this, we propose a novel multi-modal co-learning framework capable of
generalizing across various tasks without targeting a specific modality for
inference. Our approach combines contrastive and modality discriminative
learning together to guide single-modality models to structure the internal
model manifold into modality-shared and modality-specific information. We
evaluate our framework on four EO benchmarks spanning classification and
regression tasks across different sensor modalities, where only one of the
modalities available during training is accessible at inference time. Our
results demonstrate consistent predictive improvements over state-of-the-art
approaches from the recent machine learning and computer vision literature, as
well as EO-specific methods. The obtained findings validate our framework in
the single-modality inference scenarios across a diverse range of EO
applications.

Conclusion: 该方法在多焦点图像融合复杂挑战方面取得了重要进展，代码和权重已公开。

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) addresses the depth-of-field (DOF)
limitations of optical lenses, where only objects within a specific range
appear sharp. Although traditional and deep learning methods have advanced the
field, challenges persist, including limited training data, domain gaps from
synthetic datasets, and difficulties with regions lacking information. We
propose VAEEDOF, a novel MFIF method that uses a distilled variational
autoencoder for high-fidelity, efficient image reconstruction. Our fusion
module processes up to seven images simultaneously, enabling robust fusion
across diverse focus points. To address data scarcity, we introduce
MattingMFIF, a new syntetic 4K dataset, simulating realistic DOF effects from
real photographs. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results, generating
seamless artifact-free fused images and bridging the gap between synthetic and
real-world scenarios, offering a significant step forward in addressing complex
MFIF challenges. The code, and weights are available here:

Conclusion: 基于研究结果提出了实用的建议，为遥感语义分割中的不确定性估计提供了指导性框架。

Abstract: This paper investigates methods for estimating uncertainty in semantic
segmentation predictions derived from satellite imagery. Estimating uncertainty
for segmentation presents unique challenges compared to standard image
classification, requiring scalable methods producing per-pixel estimates. While
most research on this topic has focused on scene understanding or medical
imaging, this work benchmarks existing methods specifically for remote sensing
and Earth observation applications. Our evaluation focuses on the practical
utility of uncertainty measures, testing their ability to identify prediction
errors and noise-corrupted input image regions. Experiments are conducted on
two remote sensing datasets, PASTIS and ForTy, selected for their differences
in scale, geographic coverage, and label confidence. We perform an extensive
evaluation featuring several models, such as Stochastic Segmentation Networks
and ensembles, in combination with a number of neural architectures and
uncertainty metrics. We make a number of practical recommendations based on our
findings.

TL;DR: 提出DecAF方法，通过分解注意力融合机制将MLLM的注意力图直接转换为分割掩码，无需训练即可实现视频推理分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视频理解方面表现优异，但其注意力图存在噪声且与目标区域对齐不佳，需要一种无需训练的方法来精炼这些注意力图以实现定位。

Method: 使用分解注意力融合(DecAF)，包括对比性目标-背景融合和互补视频帧融合两种机制，结合注意力引导的SAM2提示来获得细粒度掩码。

Result: DecAF在无需训练的方法中表现优异，在参考和推理VOS基准测试中达到与基于训练方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了无需重新训练MLLM，仅通过注意力图精炼就能实现有效的视频分割，为训练自由的视频理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong video
understanding by attending to visual tokens relevant to textual queries. To
directly adapt this for localization in a training-free manner, we cast video
reasoning segmentation as a video QA task and extract attention maps via
rollout mechanism. However, raw attention maps are noisy and poorly aligned
with object regions. We propose Decomposed Attention Fusion (DecAF), which
refines these maps through two mechanisms: (1) contrastive object-background
fusion and (2) complementary video-frame fusion. This method suppresses
irrelevant activations and enhances object-focused cues, enabling direct
conversion of attention maps into coarse segmentation masks. In addition, we
introduce attention-guided SAM2 prompting for obtaining fine-grained masks.
Unlike existing methods that jointly train MLLMs with SAM, our method operates
entirely without retraining. DecAF outperforms training-free methods and
achieves performance comparable to training-based methods on both referring and
reasoning VOS benchmarks. The code will be available at

TL;DR: 提出CBDiff模型，通过生成多样化的伪造定位图来增强图像伪造定位的可信度，采用伯努利噪声和时间步交叉注意力机制提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法生成单一确定性定位图，缺乏高精度和可靠性，无法满足法医分析和安全监控等高风险应用的需求。

Method: 使用条件伯努利扩散模型(CBDiff)，引入伯努利噪声反映伪造掩码的二元稀疏特性，并设计时间步交叉注意力机制(TSCAttention)利用语义特征引导。

Result: 在8个公开基准数据集上的实验表明，CBDiff显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: CBDiff通过生成多样化定位图有效处理伪造区域的不确定性，具有强大的实际部署潜力。

Abstract: Image Forgery Localization (IFL) is a crucial task in image forensics, aimed
at accurately identifying manipulated or tampered regions within an image at
the pixel level. Existing methods typically generate a single deterministic
localization map, which often lacks the precision and reliability required for
high-stakes applications such as forensic analysis and security surveillance.
To enhance the credibility of predictions and mitigate the risk of errors, we
introduce an advanced Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Model (CBDiff). Given a
forged image, CBDiff generates multiple diverse and plausible localization
maps, thereby offering a richer and more comprehensive representation of the
forgery distribution. This approach addresses the uncertainty and variability
inherent in tampered regions. Furthermore, CBDiff innovatively incorporates
Bernoulli noise into the diffusion process to more faithfully reflect the
inherent binary and sparse properties of forgery masks. Additionally, CBDiff
introduces a Time-Step Cross-Attention (TSCAttention), which is specifically
designed to leverage semantic feature guidance with temporal steps to improve
manipulation detection. Extensive experiments on eight publicly benchmark
datasets demonstrate that CBDiff significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its strong potential for real-world
deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在医学图像理解中表现出色，但其文本概念与视觉证据的对齐能力（地面定位能力）尚未充分探索，而可靠的定位对医学领域的可解释性和临床采用至关重要。

Method: 使用七种CLIP风格的视觉语言模型变体，通过交叉注意力和基于相似性的定位图生成视觉解释，并定量评估其与放射科医生标注区域的病理对齐情况。

Result: 研究发现：(1)所有模型变体对大型明确病理定位良好，但对小型或弥散病变定位性能显著下降；(2)在胸部X光特定数据集预训练的模型比通用领域训练的模型对齐效果更好；(3)模型识别能力与定位能力强相关。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型尽管识别能力强，但在临床可靠的地面定位方面仍有不足，强调了在医学实践中部署前需要进行有针对性的可解释性基准测试。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable zero-shot
performance in medical image understanding, yet their grounding ability, the
extent to which textual concepts align with visual evidence, remains
underexplored. In the medical domain, however, reliable grounding is essential
for interpretability and clinical adoption. In this work, we present the first
systematic benchmark for evaluating cross-modal interpretability in chest
X-rays across seven CLIP-style VLM variants. We generate visual explanations
using cross-attention and similarity-based localization maps, and
quantitatively assess their alignment with radiologist-annotated regions across
multiple pathologies. Our analysis reveals that: (1) while all VLM variants
demonstrate reasonable localization for large and well-defined pathologies,
their performance substantially degrades for small or diffuse lesions; (2)
models that are pretrained on chest X-ray-specific datasets exhibit improved
alignment compared to those trained on general-domain data. (3) The overall
recognition ability and grounding ability of the model are strongly correlated.
These findings underscore that current VLMs, despite their strong recognition
ability, still fall short in clinically reliable grounding, highlighting the
need for targeted interpretability benchmarks before deployment in medical
practice. XBench code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的稀疏估计器（如小波、曲线波等）在适应复杂信号规律方面不够丰富，特别是对于边缘为分段C^α曲线的卡通图像，当Lipschitz指数α≤2且未知时，这些方法不是最优的。深度卷积神经网络虽然取得了更好的数值结果，但需要更简化的模型。

Method: 引入散射系数作为简化的卷积神经网络模型，通过小波系数模的二次小波变换计算。提出去噪估计器，通过联合最小化和最大化不同散射系数子集的ℓ¹范数来实现去噪。

Result: 数值实验表明，该去噪估计器对于所有Lipschitz指数α≤2的卡通图像都达到了渐近极小极大界。证明了这些ℓ¹范数能够捕捉不同类型的几何图像规律性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种不同的调和分析方法来抑制信号噪声并指定函数的几何规律性，在调和分析与深度卷积网络去噪估计器之间建立了数学桥梁。

Abstract: A considerable amount of research in harmonic analysis has been devoted to
non-linear estimators of signals contaminated by additive Gaussian noise. They
are implemented by thresholding coefficients in a frame, which provide a sparse
signal representation, or by minimising their $\ell^1$ norm. However, sparse
estimators in frames are not sufficiently rich to adapt to complex signal
regularities. For cartoon images whose edges are piecewise $\bf C^\alpha$
curves, wavelet, curvelet and Xlet frames are suboptimal if the Lipschitz
exponent $\alpha \leq 2$ is an unknown parameter. Deep convolutional neural
networks have recently obtained much better numerical results, which reach the
minimax asymptotic bounds for all $\alpha$. Wavelet scattering coefficients
have been introduced as simplified convolutional neural network models. They
are computed by transforming the modulus of wavelet coefficients with a second
wavelet transform. We introduce a denoising estimator by jointly minimising and
maximising the $\ell^1$ norms of different subsets of scattering coefficients.
We prove that these $\ell^1$ norms capture different types of geometric image
regularity. Numerical experiments show that this denoising estimator reaches
the minimax asymptotic bound for cartoon images for all Lipschitz exponents
$\alpha \leq 2$. We state this numerical result as a mathematical conjecture.
It provides a different harmonic analysis approach to suppress noise from
signals, and to specify the geometric regularity of functions. It also opens a
mathematical bridge between harmonic analysis and denoising estimators with
deep convolutional network.

*Junfei Zhou,Penglin Dai,Quanmin Wei,Bingyi Liu,Xiao Wu,Jianping Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GenComm方法解决异构多智能体协作中的领域差距问题，通过特征生成实现无缝感知，无需修改原网络，显著降低新智能体集成成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中异构智能体在传感器和模型上的差异导致协作时的领域差距，现有方法因需要侵入式重训练和计算成本高而难以实用。

Method: 采用生成式通信机制，包括可变形消息提取器提取空间信息，基于条件扩散模型的空间感知特征生成器生成对齐特征，以及通道增强器进行特征优化。

Result: 在OPV2V-H、DAIR-V2X和V2X-Real数据集上超越现有方法，新智能体集成时计算成本和参数数量减少81%。

Conclusion: GenComm提供了一种高效、轻量级的异构多智能体协作解决方案，实现了语义一致性保持和低成本扩展。

Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration enhances the perception capabilities of individual
agents through information sharing. However, in real-world applications,
differences in sensors and models across heterogeneous agents inevitably lead
to domain gaps during collaboration. Existing approaches based on adaptation
and reconstruction fail to support pragmatic heterogeneous collaboration due to
two key limitations: (1) Intrusive retraining of the encoder or core modules
disrupts the established semantic consistency among agents; and (2)
accommodating new agents incurs high computational costs, limiting scalability.
To address these challenges, we present a novel Generative Communication
mechanism (GenComm) that facilitates seamless perception across heterogeneous
multi-agent systems through feature generation, without altering the original
network, and employs lightweight numerical alignment of spatial information to
efficiently integrate new agents at minimal cost. Specifically, a tailored
Deformable Message Extractor is designed to extract spatial message for each
collaborator, which is then transmitted in place of intermediate features. The
Spatial-Aware Feature Generator, utilizing a conditional diffusion model,
generates features aligned with the ego agent's semantic space while preserving
the spatial information of the collaborators. These generated features are
further refined by a Channel Enhancer before fusion. Experiments conducted on
the OPV2V-H, DAIR-V2X and V2X-Real datasets demonstrate that GenComm
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an 81\% reduction in
both computational cost and parameter count when incorporating new agents. Our
code is available at https://github.com/jeffreychou777/GenComm.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AMR是一个无需外部依赖的增强时刻检索框架，通过两阶段训练解决现有方法的数据稀缺、边界模糊和语义区分不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有时刻检索方法的三个关键瓶颈：数据稀缺导致模型陷入浅层关键词特征关联、相邻事件间边界模糊、以及细粒度语义区分能力不足。

Method: 提出两阶段训练框架：冷启动阶段使用课程学习在增强数据上建立基础边界/语义感知；蒸馏阶段引入双查询集（原始查询和主动查询），通过跨阶段蒸馏损失保持知识一致性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，AMR相比先前最先进方法实现了性能提升。

Conclusion: AMR框架能够在不依赖额外数据的情况下解决边界模糊和语义混淆问题，同时保持边界和语义区分能力，显著提升时刻检索性能。

Abstract: Existing Moment Retrieval methods face three critical bottlenecks: (1) data
scarcity forces models into shallow keyword-feature associations; (2) boundary
ambiguity in transition regions between adjacent events; (3) insufficient
discrimination of fine-grained semantics (e.g., distinguishing ``kicking" vs.
``throwing" a ball). In this paper, we propose a zero-external-dependency
Augmented Moment Retrieval framework, AMR, designed to overcome local optima
caused by insufficient data annotations and the lack of robust boundary and
semantic discrimination capabilities. AMR is built upon two key insights: (1)
it resolves ambiguous boundary information and semantic confusion in existing
annotations without additional data (avoiding costly manual labeling), and (2)
it preserves boundary and semantic discriminative capabilities enhanced by
training while generalizing to real-world scenarios, significantly improving
performance. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training framework with
cold-start and distillation adaptation. The cold-start stage employs curriculum
learning on augmented data to build foundational boundary/semantic awareness.
The distillation stage introduces dual query sets: Original Queries maintain
DETR-based localization using frozen Base Queries from the cold-start model,
while Active Queries dynamically adapt to real-data distributions. A
cross-stage distillation loss enforces consistency between Original and Base
Queries, preventing knowledge forgetting while enabling real-world
generalization. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that AMR achieves
improved performance over prior state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: 提出了MedReason-R1医学视觉语言模型，通过嵌入放大病灶区域和GRPO强化学习框架，在CT疾病诊断中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用视觉语言模型在医学领域表现不佳，主要因为缺乏大规模高质量医学影像数据集和忽略了从粗到细的诊断过程。

Method: 构建CT-RATE-VQA数据集（84K QA对），提出MedReason-R1模型，嵌入放大病灶区域，并引入GRPO强化学习框架。

Result: MedReason-R1在CT疾病诊断中达到最先进性能，同时保持泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过强调全局定位和疾病细节，以及无监督强化学习，显著提升了医学视觉语言模型的诊断性能。

Abstract: General-purpose large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong
capabilities in generating detailed descriptions for natural images. However,
their performance in the medical domain remains suboptimal, even for relatively
straightforward tasks, primarily due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,
specialized medical imaging datasets and the neglect of the diagnostic process
that progresses from coarse to fine-grained. To address the first issue, we
construct the CT-RATE-VQA dataset, which has 84K QA pairs. For the second
issue, we propose MedReason-R1, a medical VLM with explicit reasoning process
for disease diagnosis. MedReason-R1 incorporates a novel strategy that embeds
zoom-in disease region-of-interest areas into the image, highlighting the
crucial role of both global localization and disease-specific details in
enhancing the model's diagnostic performance. Furthermore, we introduce the
GRPO reinforcement learning framework to MedReason-R1, which enables effective
reasoning without relying on costly manual annotations. Compared to recent
general-purpose and medical VLMs, MedReason-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance in CT disease diagnosis while retaining generalization. The code,
checkpoints, and dataset are available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReAct-GS通过重要性感知的致密化准则和参数扰动机制，解决了3D高斯泼溅中的梯度稀释和基元冻结问题，有效消除了过重构伪影并提升了新视图合成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅在复杂场景中会出现过重构伪影，表现为局部模糊和针状扭曲。现有方法归因于大规模高斯分裂不足，但本文发现了两个根本限制：致密化过程中的梯度幅度稀释和基元冻结现象。

Method: 提出了ReAct-GS方法，包含：(1) 重要性感知致密化准则，结合多视角的α混合权重来重新激活复杂区域中停滞的基元生长；(2) 重新激活机制，通过自适应参数扰动来激活冻结的基元。

Result: 在多个真实世界数据集上的综合实验表明，ReAct-GS有效消除了过重构伪影，在新视图合成标准指标上达到最先进性能，同时保留了精细的几何细节。该机制与其他3D-GS变体（如Pixel-GS）集成时也带来一致改进。

Conclusion: ReAct-GS通过重新激活机制成功解决了3D高斯泼溅中的关键限制，展示了在消除过重构伪影和提升新视图合成质量方面的有效性，并具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) achieves real-time photorealistic novel view
synthesis, yet struggles with complex scenes due to over-reconstruction
artifacts, manifesting as local blurring and needle-shape distortions. While
recent approaches attribute these issues to insufficient splitting of
large-scale Gaussians, we identify two fundamental limitations: gradient
magnitude dilution during densification and the primitive frozen phenomenon,
where essential Gaussian densification is inhibited in complex regions while
suboptimally scaled Gaussians become trapped in local optima. To address these
challenges, we introduce ReAct-GS, a method founded on the principle of
re-activation. Our approach features: (1) an importance-aware densification
criterion incorporating $\alpha$-blending weights from multiple viewpoints to
re-activate stalled primitive growth in complex regions, and (2) a
re-activation mechanism that revitalizes frozen primitives through adaptive
parameter perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across diverse real-world
datasets demonstrate that ReAct-GS effectively eliminates over-reconstruction
artifacts and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard novel view
synthesis metrics while preserving intricate geometric details. Additionally,
our re-activation mechanism yields consistent improvements when integrated with
other 3D-GS variants such as Pixel-GS, demonstrating its broad applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有驾驶世界模型主要用于世界模拟，与轨迹规划解耦，缺乏对世界建模如何促进规划的协同机制探索。

Method: PWM通过协作的状态-动作预测实现类人的预期感知，采用动态增强的并行令牌生成机制，配备上下文引导的令牌化器和自适应动态焦点损失。

Result: 仅使用前摄像头输入，该方法匹配或超越了依赖多视角和多模态输入的最先进方法。

Conclusion: PWM展示了将世界建模与规划统一的有效性，通过动作无关的未来状态预测显著提升了规划性能。

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in driving world models, their potential for
autonomous systems remains largely untapped: the world models are mostly
learned for world simulation and decoupled from trajectory planning. While
recent efforts aim to unify world modeling and planning in a single framework,
the synergistic facilitation mechanism of world modeling for planning still
requires further exploration. In this work, we introduce a new driving paradigm
named Policy World Model (PWM), which not only integrates world modeling and
trajectory planning within a unified architecture, but is also able to benefit
planning using the learned world knowledge through the proposed action-free
future state forecasting scheme. Through collaborative state-action prediction,
PWM can mimic the human-like anticipatory perception, yielding more reliable
planning performance. To facilitate the efficiency of video forecasting, we
further introduce a dynamically enhanced parallel token generation mechanism,
equipped with a context-guided tokenizer and an adaptive dynamic focal loss.
Despite utilizing only front camera input, our method matches or exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches that rely on multi-view and multi-modal inputs.

TL;DR: 该研究使用认知心理学中的视觉搜索范式来评估多模态大语言模型的视觉处理机制，发现先进模型在颜色和尺寸特征搜索中表现出类似人类的"弹出"效应，但在多特征搜索中存在容量限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务上表现良好，但其视觉处理机制不透明。现有黑盒评估主要关注任务准确性，很少揭示底层机制。

Method: 采用经典的视觉搜索范式，针对颜色、尺寸和光照特征进行控制实验，通过微调和机制可解释性分析验证发现。

Result: 发现先进MLLMs在颜色或尺寸的单特征搜索中表现出人类般的弹出效应，在多特征搜索中存在容量限制，并且像人类一样将自然场景先验（如光照方向）整合到对象表征中。

Conclusion: 视觉搜索可以作为认知基础诊断工具，用于评估MLLMs的感知能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on
vision-language tasks, yet their visual processing is opaque. Most black-box
evaluations measure task accuracy, but reveal little about underlying
mechanisms. Drawing on cognitive psychology, we adapt classic visual search
paradigms -- originally developed to study human perception -- to test whether
MLLMs exhibit the ``pop-out'' effect, where salient visual features are
detected independently of distractor set size. Using controlled experiments
targeting colour, size and lighting features, we find that advanced MLLMs
exhibit human-like pop-out effects in colour or size-based disjunctive (single
feature) search, as well as capacity limits for conjunctive (multiple feature)
search. We also find evidence to suggest that MLLMs, like humans, incorporate
natural scene priors such as lighting direction into object representations. We
reinforce our findings using targeted fine-tuning and mechanistic
interpretability analyses. Our work shows how visual search can serve as a
cognitively grounded diagnostic tool for evaluating perceptual capabilities in
MLLMs.

Motivation: 现有无配对图像翻译方法会扭曲细长曲线结构（如微血管），影响诊断可靠性和定量分析，这在眼科和血管成像中尤为重要

Method: CST框架通过集成曲线结构提取模块提供拓扑监督，可无缝整合到现有方法中，已集成到CycleGAN和UNSB作为代表性骨干网络

Result: 在三种成像模态（OCT血管造影、彩色眼底和X射线冠状动脉造影）上的综合评估显示，CST提高了翻译保真度并达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 通过强化学习映射中的几何完整性，CST为医学成像中曲线结构感知的跨域翻译建立了原则性途径

Abstract: Unpaired image-to-image translation has emerged as a crucial technique in
medical imaging, enabling cross-modality synthesis, domain adaptation, and data
augmentation without costly paired datasets. Yet, existing approaches often
distort fine curvilinear structures, such as microvasculature, undermining both
diagnostic reliability and quantitative analysis. This limitation is
consequential in ophthalmic and vascular imaging, where subtle morphological
changes carry significant clinical meaning. We propose Curvilinear
Structure-preserving Translation (CST), a general framework that explicitly
preserves fine curvilinear structures during unpaired translation by
integrating structure consistency into the training. Specifically, CST augments
baseline models with a curvilinear extraction module for topological
supervision. It can be seamlessly incorporated into existing methods. We
integrate it into CycleGAN and UNSB as two representative backbones.
Comprehensive evaluation across three imaging modalities: optical coherence
tomography angiography, color fundus and X-ray coronary angiography
demonstrates that CST improves translation fidelity and achieves
state-of-the-art performance. By reinforcing geometric integrity in learned
mappings, CST establishes a principled pathway toward curvilinear
structure-aware cross-domain translation in medical imaging.

Motivation: 现有的深度学习呈现攻击检测系统虽然有效，但大多作为黑盒运行，决策过程不透明。需要视觉解释技术来理解系统判断生物特征图像真伪的关键区域。

Method: 提出Ensemble-CAM技术，通过集成方法为深度学习面部PAD系统生成视觉解释，揭示系统决策的关键区域。

Result: 该方法能够提供详细的视觉解释，帮助理解深度学习面部PAD系统的决策过程，识别导致图像被判断为真实或伪造的关键区域。

Conclusion: Ensemble-CAM技术能够增强深度学习面部PAD系统的透明度和可信度，通过视觉解释帮助用户更好地理解系统行为。

Abstract: Presentation attacks represent a critical security threat where adversaries
use fake biometric data, such as face, fingerprint, or iris images, to gain
unauthorized access to protected systems. Various presentation attack detection
(PAD) systems have been designed leveraging deep learning (DL) models to
mitigate this type of threat. Despite their effectiveness, most of the DL
models function as black boxes - their decisions are opaque to their users. The
purpose of explainability techniques is to provide detailed information about
the reason behind the behavior or decision of DL models. In particular, visual
explanation is necessary to better understand the decisions or predictions of
DL-based PAD systems and determine the key regions due to which a biometric
image is considered real or fake by the system. In this work, a novel
technique, Ensemble-CAM, is proposed for providing visual explanations for the
decisions made by deep learning-based face PAD systems. Our goal is to improve
DL-based face PAD systems by providing a better understanding of their
behavior. Our provided visual explanations will enhance the transparency and
trustworthiness of DL-based face PAD systems.

TL;DR: LyTimeT是一个两阶段框架，通过时空注意力机制和稳定性约束从高维视频中提取可解释的动态系统变量，有效抑制视觉干扰因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从高维视频中提取系统真实动态变量具有挑战性，因为存在背景运动、遮挡和纹理变化等干扰视觉因素。

Method: 第一阶段使用时序变换器自编码器，通过全局注意力关注动态相关区域；第二阶段通过线性相关分析选择物理意义维度，并用李雅普诺夫稳定性正则化器优化过渡动态。

Result: 在五个合成基准和四个真实世界动态系统上的实验显示，LyTimeT在互信息和内在维度估计上最接近真实值，对背景扰动保持不变性，在CNN和变换器基线中达到最低分析均方误差。

Conclusion: 结合时空注意力和稳定性约束可以产生不仅准确而且物理可解释的预测模型。

Abstract: Extracting the true dynamical variables of a system from high-dimensional
video is challenging due to distracting visual factors such as background
motion, occlusions, and texture changes. We propose LyTimeT, a two-phase
framework for interpretable variable extraction that learns robust and stable
latent representations of dynamical systems. In Phase 1, LyTimeT employs a
spatio-temporal TimeSformer-based autoencoder that uses global attention to
focus on dynamically relevant regions while suppressing nuisance variation,
enabling distraction-robust latent state learning and accurate long-horizon
video prediction. In Phase 2, we probe the learned latent space, select the
most physically meaningful dimensions using linear correlation analysis, and
refine the transition dynamics with a Lyapunov-based stability regularizer to
enforce contraction and reduce error accumulation during roll-outs. Experiments
on five synthetic benchmarks and four real-world dynamical systems, including
chaotic phenomena, show that LyTimeT achieves mutual information and intrinsic
dimension estimates closest to ground truth, remains invariant under background
perturbations, and delivers the lowest analytical mean squared error among
CNN-based (TIDE) and transformer-only baselines. Our results demonstrate that
combining spatio-temporal attention with stability constraints yields
predictive models that are not only accurate but also physically interpretable.

Conclusion: ADQ通过自适应权重量化和硬件友好激活映射，有效解决了量化中的分布不均和码本不匹配问题，在极低位宽下实现了优异的性能。

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) is a critical technique for deploying deep
neural networks on resource-constrained devices. However, existing methods
often face two major challenges: the highly non-uniform distribution of
activations and the static, mismatched codebooks used in weight quantization.
To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Distribution-aware
Quantization (ADQ), a mixed-precision quantization framework that employs a
differentiated strategy. The core of ADQ is a novel adaptive weight
quantization scheme comprising three key innovations: (1) a quantile-based
initialization method that constructs a codebook closely aligned with the
initial weight distribution; (2) an online codebook adaptation mechanism based
on Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to dynamically track distributional shifts;
and (3) a sensitivity-informed strategy for mixed-precision allocation. For
activations, we integrate a hardware-friendly non-uniform-to-uniform mapping
scheme. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. On
ImageNet, ADQ enables a ResNet-18 to achieve 71.512% Top-1 accuracy with an
average bit-width of only 2.81 bits, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
under comparable conditions. Furthermore, detailed ablation studies on CIFAR-10
systematically demonstrate the individual contributions of each innovative
component, validating the rationale and effectiveness of our design.

Abstract: This paper introduces OmniMotion-X, a versatile multimodal framework for
whole-body human motion generation, leveraging an autoregressive diffusion
transformer in a unified sequence-to-sequence manner. OmniMotion-X efficiently
supports diverse multimodal tasks, including text-to-motion, music-to-dance,
speech-to-gesture, and global spatial-temporal control scenarios (e.g., motion
prediction, in-betweening, completion, and joint/trajectory-guided synthesis),
as well as flexible combinations of these tasks. Specifically, we propose the
use of reference motion as a novel conditioning signal, substantially enhancing
the consistency of generated content, style, and temporal dynamics crucial for
realistic animations. To handle multimodal conflicts, we introduce a
progressive weak-to-strong mixed-condition training strategy. To enable
high-quality multimodal training, we construct OmniMoCap-X, the largest unified
multimodal motion dataset to date, integrating 28 publicly available MoCap
sources across 10 distinct tasks, standardized to the SMPL-X format at 30 fps.
To ensure detailed and consistent annotations, we render sequences into videos
and use GPT-4o to automatically generate structured and hierarchical captions,
capturing both low-level actions and high-level semantics. Extensive
experimental evaluations confirm that OmniMotion-X significantly surpasses
existing methods, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across multiple
multimodal tasks and enabling the interactive generation of realistic,
coherent, and controllable long-duration motions.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在分布偏移时性能下降，现有测试时适应方法忽视了长尾分布中的原型退化和语义相似类间的混淆问题。

Method: 使用类感知原型缓存模块动态调整每类容量，配合负对比学习机制约束困难负样本；采用非对称优化，仅优化文本原型而固定视觉特征。

Conclusion: CPL-NC是一个轻量级的测试时适应框架，能有效提升视觉语言模型在分布偏移下的泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot generalization
through large-scale image-text pretraining, yet their performance can drop once
the deployment distribution diverges from the training distribution. To address
this, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods update models using unlabeled target
data. However, existing approaches often ignore two key challenges: prototype
degradation in long-tailed distributions and confusion between semantically
similar classes. To tackle these issues, we propose \textbf{C}lass-Aware
\textbf{P}rototype \textbf{L}earning with \textbf{N}egative
\textbf{C}ontrast(\textbf{CPL-NC}), a lightweight TTA framework designed
specifically for VLMs to enhance generalization under distribution shifts.
CPL-NC introduces a \textit{Class-Aware Prototype Cache} Module that
dynamically adjusts per-class capacity based on test-time frequency and
activation history, with a rejuvenation mechanism for inactive classes to
retain rare-category knowledge. Additionally, a \textit{Negative Contrastive
Learning} Mechanism identifies and constrains hard visual-textual negatives to
improve class separability. The framework employs asymmetric optimization,
refining only textual prototypes while anchoring on stable visual features.
Experiments on 15 benchmarks show that CPL-NC consistently outperforms prior
TTA methods across both ResNet-50 and ViT-B/16 backbones.

Conclusion: Pico-Banana-400K为训练和基准测试下一代文本引导图像编辑模型提供了大规模、高质量和任务丰富的基础资源。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated remarkable text-guided
image editing capabilities, with systems like GPT-4o and Nano-Banana setting
new benchmarks. However, the research community's progress remains constrained
by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly accessible datasets
built from real images. We introduce Pico-Banana-400K, a comprehensive
400K-image dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our dataset is
constructed by leveraging Nano-Banana to generate diverse edit pairs from real
photographs in the OpenImages collection. What distinguishes Pico-Banana-400K
from previous synthetic datasets is our systematic approach to quality and
diversity. We employ a fine-grained image editing taxonomy to ensure
comprehensive coverage of edit types while maintaining precise content
preservation and instruction faithfulness through MLLM-based quality scoring
and careful curation. Beyond single turn editing, Pico-Banana-400K enables
research into complex editing scenarios. The dataset includes three specialized
subsets: (1) a 72K-example multi-turn collection for studying sequential
editing, reasoning, and planning across consecutive modifications; (2) a
56K-example preference subset for alignment research and reward model training;

Result: 分析显示现有指标对曲率扰动严重不敏感，如使平坦表面变波浪形。

Conclusion: 提出了基于相对表面法向的新评估指标、新的深度可视化工具以及构建更好对齐人类判断的复合指标的原理方法。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation is an important task with rapid progress, but how
to evaluate it remains an open question, as evidenced by a lack of
standardization in existing literature and a large selection of evaluation
metrics whose trade-offs and behaviors are not well understood. This paper
contributes a novel, quantitative analysis of existing metrics in terms of
their sensitivity to various types of perturbations of ground truth,
emphasizing comparison to human judgment. Our analysis reveals that existing
metrics are severely under-sensitive to curvature perturbation such as making
flat surfaces wavy. To remedy this, we introduce a new metric based on relative
surface normals, along with new depth visualization tools and a principled
method to create composite metrics with better human alignment. Code and data
are available at: https://github.com/princeton-vl/evalmde.

Motivation: 开发能够将数字化打印文档（如PDF）转换为干净、自然排序的纯文本的先进OCR系统，特别是在复杂布局处理方面。

Method: 使用7B视觉语言模型，采用强化学习与可验证奖励训练方法，奖励基于多样化的二元单元测试；开发了生成合成文档的流水线，包含多样化布局和已知HTML源代码。

Result: 在olmOCR-Bench基准测试中达到最先进性能，在数学公式转换、表格解析和多列布局方面相比之前版本有最大改进。

Conclusion: olmOCR 2在复杂文档OCR任务中表现出色，模型、数据和代码已按开放许可发布。

Abstract: We present olmOCR 2, the latest in our family of powerful OCR systems for
converting digitized print documents, like PDFs, into clean, naturally ordered
plain text. olmOCR 2 is powered by olmOCR-2-7B-1025, a specialized, 7B vision
language model (VLM) trained using reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR), where our rewards are a diverse set of binary unit tests. To
scale unit test creation, we develop a pipeline for generating synthetic
documents with diverse and challenging layouts, known ground-truth HTML source
code, and extracted test cases. We show that RL training on these test cases
results in state-of-the-art performance on olmOCR-Bench, our English-language
OCR benchmark, with the largest improvements in math formula conversion, table
parsing, and multi-column layouts compared to previous versions. We release our
model, data and code under permissive open licenses.

TL;DR: ITTO是一个新的点跟踪基准测试套件，包含真实世界视频和高质量人工标注，用于评估点跟踪方法在复杂运动、遮挡和物体多样性方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试缺乏真实世界场景的运动复杂性、遮挡模式和物体多样性，需要新的测试平台来评估和诊断点跟踪方法的局限性。

Method: 从现有数据集和第一人称真实世界录制中获取视频，通过多阶段流程收集高质量人工标注，构建包含复杂运动、遮挡和多样物体的基准测试。

Result: 对最先进跟踪方法在ITTO上的严格分析表明，现有跟踪器在处理这些挑战时表现不佳，特别是在遮挡后重新识别点方面存在严重问题。

Conclusion: ITTO可作为推进点跟踪技术的基础测试平台，指导开发更鲁棒的跟踪算法，需要针对真实世界动态的新建模方法。

Abstract: We introduce ITTO, a challenging new benchmark suite for evaluating and
diagnosing the capabilities and limitations of point tracking methods. Our
videos are sourced from existing datasets and egocentric real-world recordings,
with high-quality human annotations collected through a multi-stage pipeline.
ITTO captures the motion complexity, occlusion patterns, and object diversity
characteristic of real-world scenes -- factors that are largely absent in
current benchmarks. We conduct a rigorous analysis of state-of-the-art tracking
methods on ITTO, breaking down performance along key axes of motion complexity.
Our findings reveal that existing trackers struggle with these challenges,
particularly in re-identifying points after occlusion, highlighting critical
failure modes. These results point to the need for new modeling approaches
tailored to real-world dynamics. We envision ITTO as a foundation testbed for
advancing point tracking and guiding the development of more robust tracking
algorithms.
