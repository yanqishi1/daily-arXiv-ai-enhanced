For example, can a model recognize the broad\naction \"punching\" when presented with an unseen variation such as \"punching\nperson\"? To explore this, we introduce a motion transferability framework with\nthree datasets: (1) Syn-TA, a synthetic dataset with 3D object motions; (2)\nKinetics400-TA; and (3) Something-Something-v2-TA, both adapted from natural\nvideo datasets.

To explore this question, we constructed a\ndataset of 22.1 million words from unscripted spoken language drawn from\nconversational science and technology podcasts. We analyzed lexical trends\nbefore and after ChatGPT's release in 2022, focusing on commonly LLM-associated\nwords. Our results show a moderate yet significant increase in the usage of\nthese words post-2022, suggesting a convergence between human word choices and\nLLM-associated patterns. In contrast, baseline synonym words exhibit no\nsignificant directional shift. Given the short time frame and the number of\nwords affected, this may indicate the onset of a remarkable shift in language\nuse. Whether this represents natural language change or a novel shift driven by\nAI exposure remains an open question.

Despite their potential, existing work faces challenges\nwhen deploying LLMs in agent-based environments. The widely adopted agent\nparadigm ReAct centers on integrating single-step reasoning with immediate\naction execution, which limits its effectiveness in complex tasks requiring\nlong-term strategic planning. Furthermore, the coordination between the planner\nand executor during problem-solving is also a critical factor to consider in\nagent design. Additionally, current approaches predominantly rely on supervised\nfine-tuning, which often leads models to memorize established task completion\ntrajectories, thereby restricting their generalization ability when confronted\nwith novel problem contexts.

However,\nexisting work predominantly assumes the effectiveness of the demonstrations\nprovided within ICL, while many research indicates that not all demonstrations\nare effective, failing to yielding any performance improvement during ICL.\nTherefore, in this paper, we investigate the reasons behind demonstration\nineffectiveness. Our analysis is based on gradient flow and linear\nself-attention models. By setting the gradient flow to zero, we deduce that a\ndemonstration becomes ineffective if its information has either been learned by\nthe model or is irrelevant to the user query. Furthermore, we demonstrate that\nin multi-layer models, the disparity in effectiveness among demonstrations is\namplified with layer increasing, causing the model to focus more on effective\nones. Considering that current demonstration selection methods primarily focus\non the relevance to the user query while overlooking the information that the\nmodel has already assimilated, we propose a novel method called GradS, which\nleverages gradient flow for demonstration selection. We use the magnitude of\nthe gradient flow of the demonstration with respect to a given user query as\nthe criterion, thereby ensuring the effectiveness of the chosen ones.

The structure combining the residual dense channel attention block and\nthe Mamba state space module is designed, which combines the local feature\nextraction capability of the convolutional layer with the modeling advantage of\nthe state space model for long-distance dependencies. At the same time, the\nmodel adopts a multi-scale cross-modal fusion strategy to make full use of the\nhigh-frequency texture information from the color image to guide the\nsuper-resolution process of the depth map.

However,\nthe existing training-free guidance frameworks either have heavy memory\nrequirements or offer sub-optimal control due to rough estimation. These\nshortcomings limit the applicability to control diffusion models that require\nintense computation, such as Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models. In this\nwork, we propose Taming Inference Time Alignment for Guided Text-to-Video\nDiffusion Model, so-called TITAN-Guide, which overcomes memory space issues,\nand provides more optimal control in the guidance process compared to the\ncounterparts. In particular, we develop an efficient method for optimizing\ndiffusion latents without backpropagation from a discriminative guiding model.\nIn particular, we study forward gradient descents for guided diffusion tasks\nwith various options on directional directives.

In this work, we propose\nFlat-LoRA and its efficient version i.e., EFlat-LoRA, to seek flat minima for\nLoRA. Concretely, we theoretically demonstrate that perturbations in the full\nparameter space can be transferred to the low-rank subspace. This approach\neliminates the potential interference introduced by perturbations across\nmultiple matrices in the low-rank subspace. Our extensive experiments on large\nlanguage models and vision-language models demonstrate that EFlat-LoRA achieves\noptimize efficiency comparable to that of LoRA while simultaneously attaining\ncomparable or even better performance. For example, on the GLUE dataset with\nRoBERTa-large, EFlat-LoRA outperforms LoRA and full fine-tuning by 1.0% and\n0.5% on average, respectively. On vision-language models e.g., Qwen-VL-Chat\nshows performance improvements of 1.5% and 1.0% on SQA and VizWiz datasets,\nrespectively.

Moreover, accurate estimation of animal pose and\nshape across diverse species is essential for quantitative analysis in\nbiological research. However, this topic remains underexplored due to the\nlimited network capacity of previous methods and the scarcity of comprehensive\nmulti-species datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce AniMer+, an\nextended version of our scalable AniMer framework. In this paper, we focus on a\nunified approach for reconstructing mammals (mammalia) and birds (aves). A key\ninnovation of AniMer+ is its high-capacity, family-aware Vision Transformer\n(ViT) incorporating a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design. Its architecture\npartitions network layers into taxa-specific components (for mammalia and aves)\nand taxa-shared components, enabling efficient learning of both distinct and\ncommon anatomical features within a single model. To overcome the critical\nshortage of 3D training data, especially for birds, we introduce a\ndiffusion-based conditional image generation pipeline. This pipeline produces\ntwo large-scale synthetic datasets: CtrlAni3D for quadrupeds and CtrlAVES3D for\nbirds. To note, CtrlAVES3D is the first large-scale, 3D-annotated dataset for\nbirds, which is crucial for resolving single-view depth ambiguities. Trained on\nan aggregated collection of 41.3k mammalian and 12.4k avian images (combining\nreal and synthetic data), our method demonstrates superior performance over\nexisting approaches across a wide range of benchmarks, including the\nchallenging out-of-domain Animal Kingdom dataset.

The unified spatio-temporal space brings two benefits,\ni.e., efficient feature transmission and superior feature fusion. 1) Efficient\nfeature transmission: each static object yields a single observation in the\nspatial temporal space, and thus only requires transmission only once (whereas\nprior methods re-transmit all the object features multiple times). 2) superior\nfeature fusion: merging the multi-agent and multi-time fusion into a unified\nspatial-temporal aggregation enables a more holistic perspective, thereby\nenhancing perception performance in challenging scenarios.

Recently, multi-agent systems have shown promising capabilities in\nhandling complex tasks with limited data availability. To this end, we propose\nthe first collaborative multi-agent system for ACSR, named Cued-Agent.

This paper delves into a previously\noverlooked information asymmetry issue in PT, where the visual modality mostly\nconveys more context than the object-oriented textual modality.\nCorrespondingly, coarsely aligning these two modalities could result in the\nbiased attention, driving the model to merely focus on the context area. To\naddress this, we propose DAPT, an effective PT framework based on an intuitive\ndecouple-before-align concept. First, we propose to explicitly decouple the\nvisual modality into the foreground and background representation via\nexploiting coarse-and-fine visual segmenting cues, and then both of these\ndecoupled patterns are aligned with the original foreground texts and the\nhand-crafted background classes, thereby symmetrically strengthening the modal\nalignment. To further enhance the visual concentration, we propose a visual\npull-push regularization tailored for the foreground-background patterns,\ndirecting the original visual representation towards unbiased attention on the\nregion-of-interest object. We demonstrate the power of architecture-free DAPT\nthrough few-shot learning, base-to-novel generalization, and data-efficient\nlearning, all of which yield superior performance across prevailing benchmarks.\nOur code will be released at https://github.com/Ferenas/DAPT.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faDAPT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u6001\u4e3a\u524d\u666f\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u522b\u5bf9\u9f50\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\uff08PT\uff09\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u6001\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u533a\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDAPT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5148\u89e3\u8026\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u6001\u4e3a\u524d\u666f\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u518d\u5206\u522b\u5bf9\u9f50\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u62c9\u63a8\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u57fa\u7840\u5230\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "DAPT\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u79f0\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

To bridge this gap, we leverage these latent signals and introduce\nDAEDAL, a novel training-free denoising strategy that enables Dynamic Adaptive\nLength Expansion for Diffusion Large Language Models. DAEDAL operates in two\nphases: 1) Before the denoising process, DAEDAL starts from a short initial\nlength and iteratively expands it to a coarse task-appropriate length, guided\nby a sequence completion metric. 2) During the denoising process, DAEDAL\ndynamically intervenes by pinpointing and expanding insufficient generation\nregions through mask token insertion, ensuring the final output is fully\ndeveloped. Extensive experiments on DLLMs demonstrate that DAEDAL achieves\nperformance comparable, and in some cases superior, to meticulously tuned\nfixed-length baselines, while simultaneously enhancing computational efficiency\nby achieving a higher effective token ratio. By resolving the static length\nconstraint, DAEDAL unlocks new potential for DLLMs, bridging a critical gap\nwith their Autoregressive counterparts and paving the way for more efficient\nand capable generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "DAEDAL\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u957f\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55\u89e3\u51b3\u6269\u6563\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08DLLMs\uff09\u7684\u9759\u6001\u957f\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08DLLMs\uff09\u56e0\u9759\u6001\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u751f\u6210\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "DAEDAL\u5206\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u64cd\u4f5c\uff1a1\uff09\u5728\u53bb\u566a\u524d\u4ece\u77ed\u521d\u59cb\u957f\u5ea6\u8fed\u4ee3\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u4efb\u52a1\u5408\u9002\u957f\u5ea6\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u6269\u5c55\u4e0d\u8db3\u751f\u6210\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "DAEDAL\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4e0e\u56fa\u5b9a\u957f\u5ea6\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "DAEDAL\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86DLLMs\u7684\u9759\u6001\u957f\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u5176\u4e0e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

In this paper, we suggest the\nuse of video inpainting models that excel in object flow learning and\nreconstruction in outpainting rather than solely generating the background as\nin existing methods. However, directly applying or fine-tuning inpainting\nmodels to outpainting has shown to be ineffective, often leading to blurry\nresults. Our extensive experiments on discriminator designs reveal that a\ncritical component missing in the outpainting fine-tuning process is a\ndiscriminator capable of effectively assessing the perceptual quality of the\nextended areas. To tackle this limitation, we differentiate the objectives of\nadversarial training into global and local goals and introduce a hierarchical\ndiscriminator that meets both objectives. Additionally, we develop a\nspecialized outpainting loss function that leverages both local and global\nfeatures of the discriminator.

Mamba, as an emerging state space model with\ninherently linear complexity and global receptive fields, is highly suitable\nfor processing image segmentation tasks with long sequence features. However,\ndue to the particularity of underwater scenes, there are many challenges in\napplying Mamba to UIS. The existing fixed-patch scanning mechanism cannot\nmaintain the internal continuity of scanned instances in the presence of\nseverely underwater color distortion and blurred instance boundaries, and the\nhidden state of the complex underwater background can also inhibit the\nunderstanding of instance objects. In this work, we propose the first\nMamba-based underwater instance segmentation model UIS-Mamba, and design two\ninnovative modules, Dynamic Tree Scan (DTS) and Hidden State Weaken (HSW), to\nmigrate Mamba to the underwater task. DTS module maintains the continuity of\nthe internal features of the instance objects by allowing the patches to\ndynamically offset and scale, thereby guiding the minimum spanning tree and\nproviding dynamic local receptive fields. HSW module suppresses the\ninterference of complex backgrounds and effectively focuses the information\nflow of state propagation to the instances themselves through the Ncut-based\nhidden state weakening mechanism. Experimental results show that UIS-Mamba\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on both UIIS and USIS10K datasets, while\nmaintaining a low number of parameters and computational complexity.

While recent deep learning methods have advanced lesion segmentation,\nthey primarily target large lesions and neglect valuable longitudinal and\nclinical information routinely used by radiologists. In real-world screening,\ndetecting subtle or emerging lesions requires radiologists to compare across\ntimepoints and consider previous radiology assessments, such as the BI-RADS\nscore. We propose LesiOnTime, a novel 3D segmentation approach that mimics\nclinical diagnostic workflows by jointly leveraging longitudinal imaging and\nBIRADS scores. The key components are: (1) a Temporal Prior Attention (TPA)\nblock that dynamically integrates information from previous and current scans;\nand (2) a BI-RADS Consistency Regularization (BCR) loss that enforces latent\nspace alignment for scans with similar radiological assessments, thus embedding\ndomain knowledge into the training process. Evaluated on a curated in-house\nlongitudinal dataset of high-risk patients with DCE-MRI, our approach\noutperforms state-of-the-art single-timepoint and longitudinal baselines by 5%\nin terms of Dice.

However, in complex real-world scenes, characterized by\nextreme viewpoint and scale changes as well as pronounced depth\ndiscontinuities, the motion field often exhibits diverse and heterogeneous\nmotion patterns. Most existing methods lack targeted modeling strategies and\nfail to explicitly account for this variability, resulting in estimated motion\nfields that diverge from their true underlying structure and distribution. We\nobserve that Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) can assign dedicated experts to motion\nsub-fields, enabling a divide-and-conquer strategy for heterogeneous motion\npatterns. Building on this insight, we re-architect motion field modeling in\ntwo-view geometry with GeoMoE, a streamlined framework. Specifically, we first\ndevise a Probabilistic Prior-Guided Decomposition strategy that exploits inlier\nprobability signals to perform a structure-aware decomposition of the motion\nfield into heterogeneous sub-fields, sharply curbing outlier-induced bias.\nNext, we introduce an MoE-Enhanced Bi-Path Rectifier that enhances each\nsub-field along spatial-context and channel-semantic paths and routes it to a\ncustomized expert for targeted modeling, thereby decoupling heterogeneous\nmotion regimes, suppressing cross-sub-field interference and representational\nentanglement, and yielding fine-grained motion-field rectification. With this\nminimalist design, GeoMoE outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in\nrelative pose and homography estimation and shows strong generalization.

Project page:\n  https://gwxuan.github.io/IGL-Nav/", "summary": "Visual navigation with an image as goal is a fundamental and challenging\nproblem. Conventional methods either rely on end-to-end RL learning or\nmodular-based policy with topological graph or BEV map as memory, which cannot\nfully model the geometric relationship between the explored 3D environment and\nthe goal image. In order to efficiently and accurately localize the goal image\nin 3D space, we build our navigation system upon the renderable 3D gaussian\n(3DGS) representation. However, due to the computational intensity of 3DGS\noptimization and the large search space of 6-DoF camera pose, directly\nleveraging 3DGS for image localization during agent exploration process is\nprohibitively inefficient. To this end, we propose IGL-Nav, an Incremental 3D\nGaussian Localization framework for efficient and 3D-aware image-goal\nnavigation. Specifically, we incrementally update the scene representation as\nnew images arrive with feed-forward monocular prediction. Then we coarsely\nlocalize the goal by leveraging the geometric information for discrete space\nmatching, which can be equivalent to efficient 3D convolution. When the agent\nis close to the goal, we finally solve the fine target pose with optimization\nvia differentiable rendering. The proposed IGL-Nav outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art methods by a large margin across diverse experimental\nconfigurations. It can also handle the more challenging free-view image-goal\nsetting and be deployed on real-world robotic platform using a cellphone to\ncapture goal image at arbitrary pose.
