### [1] [Adaptive Linguistic Prompting (ALP) Enhances Phishing Webpage Detection in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13357)
*Atharva Bhargude,Ishan Gonehal,Chandler Haney,Dave Yoon,Kevin Zhu,Aaron Sandoval,Sean O'Brien,Kaustubh Vinnakota*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ALP的少样本自适应语言提示方法，利用多模态大语言模型（如GPT-4o和Gemini 1.5 Pro）检测钓鱼网页，显著提升了检测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 钓鱼攻击是严重的网络安全威胁，需要自适应检测技术。

Method: ALP是一种结构化语义推理方法，通过分解语言模式、检测紧急信号和识别钓鱼内容中的操纵性措辞，引导大语言模型分析文本欺骗。

Result: 实验表明，ALP显著提升了钓鱼检测准确率，F1分数达到0.93，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: ALP集成的多模态大语言模型为更强大、可解释和自适应的钓鱼检测系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Phishing attacks represent a significant cybersecurity threat, necessitating
adaptive detection techniques. This study explores few-shot Adaptive Linguistic
Prompting (ALP) in detecting phishing webpages through the multimodal
capabilities of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o
and Gemini 1.5 Pro. ALP is a structured semantic reasoning method that guides
LLMs to analyze textual deception by breaking down linguistic patterns,
detecting urgency cues, and identifying manipulative diction commonly found in
phishing content. By integrating textual, visual, and URL-based analysis, we
propose a unified model capable of identifying sophisticated phishing attempts.
Our experiments demonstrate that ALP significantly enhances phishing detection
accuracy by guiding LLMs through structured reasoning and contextual analysis.
The findings highlight the potential of ALP-integrated multimodal LLMs to
advance phishing detection frameworks, achieving an F1-score of 0.93,
surpassing traditional approaches. These results establish a foundation for
more robust, interpretable, and adaptive linguistic-based phishing detection
systems using LLMs.

### [2] [Persona-Based Synthetic Data Generation Using Multi-Stage Conditioning with Large Language Models for Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13380)
*Keito Inoshita,Rushia Harada*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PersonaGen是一个基于大型语言模型的多阶段人格条件框架，用于生成情感丰富的文本，解决了情感识别领域高质量数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感表达具有主观性，受个体特质、社会文化背景和情境影响，大规模数据收集存在伦理和实践困难。

Method: 通过结合人口属性、社会文化背景和详细情境构建分层虚拟人格，指导情感表达生成。

Result: 实验表明，PersonaGen在生成多样、连贯且具有区分性的情感表达方面显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: PersonaGen可作为增强或替代真实情感数据集的强大工具。

Abstract: In the field of emotion recognition, the development of high-performance
models remains a challenge due to the scarcity of high-quality, diverse
emotional datasets. Emotional expressions are inherently subjective, shaped by
individual personality traits, socio-cultural backgrounds, and contextual
factors, making large-scale, generalizable data collection both ethically and
practically difficult. To address this issue, we introduce PersonaGen, a novel
framework for generating emotionally rich text using a Large Language Model
(LLM) through multi-stage persona-based conditioning. PersonaGen constructs
layered virtual personas by combining demographic attributes, socio-cultural
backgrounds, and detailed situational contexts, which are then used to guide
emotion expression generation. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of the
generated synthetic data, assessing semantic diversity through clustering and
distributional metrics, human-likeness via LLM-based quality scoring, realism
through comparison with real-world emotion corpora, and practical utility in
downstream emotion classification tasks. Experimental results show that
PersonaGen significantly outperforms baseline methods in generating diverse,
coherent, and discriminative emotion expressions, demonstrating its potential
as a robust alternative for augmenting or replacing real-world emotional
datasets.

### [3] [SAFT: Structure-Aware Fine-Tuning of LLMs for AMR-to-Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13381)
*Rafiq Kamel,Filippo Guerranti,Simon Geisler,Stephan Günnemann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SAFT是一种结构感知的微调方法，通过注入图拓扑信息提升预训练大语言模型（LLM）在结构化输入（如AMR图）上的性能，显著提高了AMR到文本生成的BLEU分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在处理结构化输入（如AMR图）时，常忽略关键结构信息或依赖与标准LLM不兼容的架构，限制了性能。

Method: SAFT通过计算方向敏感的位置编码（基于磁拉普拉斯变换的AMR图）并将其投影到LLM的嵌入空间，无需改变模型架构。

Result: 在AMR 3.0上，SAFT比基线方法提高了3.5 BLEU分数，且性能提升随图复杂度增加而显著。

Conclusion: SAFT为结构化数据与语言模型的结合提供了一种通用且高效的途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to tasks involving
structured inputs such as graphs. Abstract Meaning Representations (AMRs),
which encode rich semantics as directed graphs, offer a rigorous testbed for
evaluating LLMs on text generation from such structures. Yet, current methods
often arbitrarily linearize AMRs, discarding key structural cues, or rely on
architectures incompatible with standard LLMs. We introduce SAFT, a
structure-aware fine-tuning approach that injects graph topology into
pretrained LLMs without architectural changes. We compute direction-sensitive
positional encodings from the magnetic Laplacian of transformed AMRs and
project them into the embedding space of the LLM. While possibly applicable to
any graph-structured inputs, we focus on AMR-to-text generation as a
representative and challenging benchmark. SAFT sets a new state-of-the-art on
AMR 3.0 with a 3.5 BLEU improvement over baselines. Gains scale with graph
complexity, highlighting the value of structure-aware representations in
enhancing LLM performance. SAFT offers a general and effective pathway for
bridging structured data and language models.

### [4] [Context-Based Fake News Detection using Graph Based Approach: ACOVID-19 Use-case](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13382)
*Chandrashekar Muniyappa,Sirisha Velampalli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图的上下文方法，利用NLP技术将新闻文章转换为图结构，并通过MDL-GBAD算法检测假新闻。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 假新闻在数字时代传播迅速，需要有效的方法进行检测。

Method: 使用NLP将新闻转换为图结构，并应用MDL-GBAD算法挖掘异常模式。

Result: 方法能够识别数据集中的规范模式并检测异常模式。

Conclusion: 基于图的方法在处理复杂上下文数据时表现优异，优于传统方法。

Abstract: In today\'s digital world, fake news is spreading with immense speed. Its a
significant concern to address. In this work, we addressed that challenge using
novel graph based approach. We took dataset from Kaggle that contains real and
fake news articles. To test our approach we incorporated recent covid-19
related news articles that contains both genuine and fake news that are
relevant to this problem. This further enhances the dataset as well instead of
relying completely on the original dataset. We propose a contextual graph-based
approach to detect fake news articles. We need to convert news articles into
appropriate schema, so we leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques
to transform news articles into contextual graph structures. We then apply the
Minimum Description Length (MDL)-based Graph-Based Anomaly Detection (GBAD)
algorithm for graph mining. Graph-based methods are particularly effective for
handling rich contextual data, as they enable the discovery of complex patterns
that traditional query-based or statistical techniques might overlook. Our
proposed approach identifies normative patterns within the dataset and
subsequently uncovers anomalous patterns that deviate from these established
norms.

### [5] [PARAM-1 BharatGen 2.9B Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13390)

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PARAM-1是一个专注于印度语言多样性的2.9B参数语言模型，通过公平表示、适应形态的标记化和文化对齐评估，提供了一种公平基础建模的设计方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）以英语为中心，忽视了印度等语言多样地区的需求，PARAM-1旨在填补这一空白。

Method: PARAM-1采用双语（印地语和英语）数据集训练，注重公平表示、适应形态的标记化和文化对齐评估。

Result: PARAM-1既是一个通用的语言模型，也是印度中心应用的强大基准。

Conclusion: PARAM-1为公平基础建模提供了设计优先的蓝图，展示了在语言多样性上的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful general-purpose
reasoning systems, yet their development remains dominated by English-centric
data, architectures, and optimization paradigms. This exclusionary design
results in structural under-representation of linguistically diverse regions
such as India, where over 20 official languages and 100+ dialects coexist
alongside phenomena like code-switching and diglossia. We introduce PARAM-1, a
2.9B parameter decoder-only, text-only language model trained from scratch with
an explicit architectural and linguistic focus on Indian diversity. PARAM-1 is
trained on a bilingual dataset consisting of only Hindi and English,
constructed with a strong focus on fact-rich, high-quality content. It is
guided by three core principles: equitable representation of Indic languages
through a 25% corpus allocation; tokenization fairness via a SentencePiece
tokenizer adapted to Indian morphological structures; and culturally aligned
evaluation benchmarks across IndicQA, code-mixed reasoning, and
socio-linguistic robustness tasks. By embedding diversity at the pretraining
level-rather than deferring it to post-hoc alignment-PARAM-1 offers a
design-first blueprint for equitable foundation modeling. Our results
demonstrate that it serves as both a competent general-purpose model and a
robust baseline for India-centric applications.

### [6] [TopicImpact: Improving Customer Feedback Analysis with Opinion Units for Topic Modeling and Star-Rating Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13392)
*Emil Häglund,Johanna Björklund*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过基于观点单元的主题建模改进客户评论分析，提升主题连贯性和情感关联性，并与业务指标结合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进现有主题建模方法，以更准确地提取客户评论中的见解，并关联情感与业务指标。

Method: 利用大语言模型提取观点单元，重构主题建模流程，结合情感分数和业务指标（如星级评分）。

Result: 提升了主题建模的性能，生成更连贯且可解释的主题，并有效捕捉情感关联。

Conclusion: 该方法在客户评论分析中表现优越，能更准确地预测业务指标（如星级评分）。

Abstract: We improve the extraction of insights from customer reviews by restructuring
the topic modelling pipeline to operate on opinion units - distinct statements
that include relevant text excerpts and associated sentiment scores. Prior work
has demonstrated that such units can be reliably extracted using large language
models. The result is a heightened performance of the subsequent topic
modeling, leading to coherent and interpretable topics while also capturing the
sentiment associated with each topic. By correlating the topics and sentiments
with business metrics, such as star ratings, we can gain insights on how
specific customer concerns impact business outcomes. We present our system's
implementation, use cases, and advantages over other topic modeling and
classification solutions. We also evaluate its effectiveness in creating
coherent topics and assess methods for integrating topic and sentiment
modalities for accurate star-rating prediction.

### [7] [Mitigating Stylistic Biases of Machine Translation Systems via Monolingual Corpora Only](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13395)
*Xuanqi Gao,Weipeng Jiang,Juan Zhai,Shiqing Ma,Siyi Xie,Xinyang Yin,Chao Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Babel框架通过单语语料库提升神经机器翻译的风格保真度，无需平行语料库或修改现有系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经机器翻译中风格保真度的挑战，避免对平行语料库的依赖。

Method: 结合风格检测器和扩散式风格应用器，作为后处理模块集成到现有NMT系统。

Result: 在五个领域中，Babel风格不一致检测精度达88.21%，风格保真度提升150%，语义相似度0.92。

Conclusion: Babel有效提升翻译的风格保真度，同时保持语义完整性和流畅性。

Abstract: The advent of neural machine translation (NMT) has revolutionized
cross-lingual communication, yet preserving stylistic nuances remains a
significant challenge. While existing approaches often require parallel corpora
for style preservation, we introduce Babel, a novel framework that enhances
stylistic fidelity in NMT using only monolingual corpora. Babel employs two key
components: (1) a style detector based on contextual embeddings that identifies
stylistic disparities between source and target texts, and (2) a
diffusion-based style applicator that rectifies stylistic inconsistencies while
maintaining semantic integrity. Our framework integrates with existing NMT
systems as a post-processing module, enabling style-aware translation without
requiring architectural modifications or parallel stylistic data. Extensive
experiments on five diverse domains (law, literature, scientific writing,
medicine, and educational content) demonstrate Babel's effectiveness: it
identifies stylistic inconsistencies with 88.21% precision and improves
stylistic preservation by 150% while maintaining a high semantic similarity
score of 0.92. Human evaluation confirms that translations refined by Babel
better preserve source text style while maintaining fluency and adequacy.

### [8] [Causal Language Control in Multilingual Transformers via Sparse Feature Steering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13410)
*Cheng-Ting Chou,George Liu,Jessica Sun,Cole Blondin,Kevin Zhu,Vasu Sharma,Sean O'Brien*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过稀疏自编码器（SAE）特征控制多语言大模型的目标生成语言，在零样本设置下实现高达90%的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在多语言大模型中确定性控制目标生成语言的挑战，尤其是在零样本设置下。

Method: 利用预训练的SAE特征识别语言差异，通过修改单个SAE特征实现语言控制。

Result: 在Gemma-2B和Gemma-9B模型中，通过修改单个SAE特征成功实现语言转换，同时保持语义保真度。

Conclusion: 稀疏特征控制是一种轻量且可解释的多语言生成控制机制。

Abstract: Deterministically controlling the target generation language of large
multilingual language models (LLMs) remains a fundamental challenge,
particularly in zero-shot settings where neither explicit language prompts nor
fine-tuning are available. In this work, we investigate whether sparse
autoencoder (SAE) features, previously shown to correlate with interpretable
model behaviors, can be leveraged to steer the generated language of LLMs
during inference. Leveraging pretrained SAEs on the residual streams of
Gemma-2B and Gemma-9B, we identify features whose activations differ most
significantly between English and four target languages: Chinese, Japanese,
Spanish, and French. By modifying just a single SAE feature at one transformer
layer, we achieve controlled language shifts with up to 90\% success, as
measured by FastText language classification, while preserving semantic
fidelity according to LaBSE (Language-Agnostic BERT Sentence Embedding)
similarity. Our analysis reveals that language steering is most effective in
mid-to-late transformer layers and is amplified by specific attention heads
disproportionately associated with language-sensitive SAE features. These
results demonstrate the promise of sparse feature steering as a lightweight and
interpretable mechanism for controllable multilingual generation.

TL;DR: ALIGNed-LLM通过知识图谱嵌入和投影层改进语言模型的事实性，显著减少幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在事实性任务中的幻觉问题，提升其可靠性。

Method: 利用知识图谱嵌入（如TransE）和投影层对齐实体与文本嵌入，改进语言模型的事实性。

Result: 在多个问答数据集和实际金融用例中，模型表现显著提升。

Conclusion: ALIGNed-LLM是一种简单有效的方法，能显著提升语言模型的事实性。

Abstract: Large language models like GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude have transformed natural
language processing (NLP) tasks such as question answering, dialogue
generation, summarization, and so forth; yet their susceptibility to
hallucination stands as one of the major challenges. Among numerous approaches
to overcome this challenge, integration of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) into language
models has emerged as a promising solution as it provides structured, reliable,
domain-specific, and up-to-date external information to the language models. In
this paper, we introduce ALIGNed-LLM, a simple yet effective approach to
improve language models' factuality via a lean strategy to infuse KGs into the
latent space of language models inspired by LLaVA where visual and textual
information is infused. We use embeddings from a pre-trained Knowledge Graph
Embedding (KGE) model, such as TransE, and a trainable projection layer to
align entity and text embeddings. This alignment enables the language model to
distinguish between similar entities improving factual grounding and reducing
hallucination. We tested our approach on three popular questions-answering
benchmark datasets alongside language models of varying sizes, showing
significant improvement. Furthermore, we applied our approach to a real-world
financial use case from a large central bank in Europe, which demands high
accuracy and precision, demonstrating a substantial improvement of the LLM
answers.

### [10] [Paper Summary Attack: Jailbreaking LLMs through LLM Safety Papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13474)
*Liang Lin,Zhihao Xu,Xuehai Tang,Shi Liu,Biyu Zhou,Fuqing Zhu,Jizhong Han,Songlin Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Paper Summary Attack (PSA)的新型越狱方法，通过利用LLMs对权威来源的信任，构造对抗性提示模板，攻击成功率高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现LLMs倾向于信任权威来源（如学术论文），这可能带来新的安全漏洞。

Method: 设计PSA方法，利用攻击或防御性LLM安全论文内容构造对抗性提示模板，并在预定义子部分中填充有害查询作为对抗性载荷。

Result: PSA在Claude3.5-Sonnet和Deepseek-R1上的攻击成功率分别达到97%和98%，并揭示了不同模型间的漏洞偏差。

Conclusion: PSA揭示了LLMs的新漏洞，为对抗性方法和安全对齐提供了未来研究方向。

Abstract: The safety of large language models (LLMs) has garnered significant research
attention. In this paper, we argue that previous empirical studies demonstrate
LLMs exhibit a propensity to trust information from authoritative sources, such
as academic papers, implying new possible vulnerabilities. To verify this
possibility, a preliminary analysis is designed to illustrate our two findings.
Based on this insight, a novel jailbreaking method, Paper Summary Attack
(\llmname{PSA}), is proposed. It systematically synthesizes content from either
attack-focused or defense-focused LLM safety paper to construct an adversarial
prompt template, while strategically infilling harmful query as adversarial
payloads within predefined subsections. Extensive experiments show significant
vulnerabilities not only in base LLMs, but also in state-of-the-art reasoning
model like Deepseek-R1. PSA achieves a 97\% attack success rate (ASR) on
well-aligned models like Claude3.5-Sonnet and an even higher 98\% ASR on
Deepseek-R1. More intriguingly, our work has further revealed diametrically
opposed vulnerability bias across different base models, and even between
different versions of the same model, when exposed to either attack-focused or
defense-focused papers. This phenomenon potentially indicates future research
clues for both adversarial methodologies and safety alignment.Code is available

TL;DR: 本文评估了三种广泛使用的价值探测策略的鲁棒性和表达能力，发现输入扰动下所有方法均表现出较大方差，并指出LLM价值探测的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型（LLM）的价值取向对用户体验的影响，但现有方法在鲁棒性和表达能力上存在不足。

Method: 通过变化提示和选项，评估三种价值探测策略，并引入两项任务研究价值对人口统计背景的响应及与模型行为的对齐。

Result: 人口统计背景对自由文本生成影响小，模型价值与基于价值的行动偏好相关性弱。

Conclusion: 需更谨慎地评估LLM价值探测方法，并意识到其局限性。

Abstract: There has been extensive research on assessing the value orientation of Large
Language Models (LLMs) as it can shape user experiences across demographic
groups. However, several challenges remain. First, while the Multiple Choice
Question (MCQ) setting has been shown to be vulnerable to perturbations, there
is no systematic comparison of probing methods for value probing. Second, it is
unclear to what extent the probed values capture in-context information and
reflect models' preferences for real-world actions. In this paper, we evaluate
the robustness and expressiveness of value representations across three widely
used probing strategies. We use variations in prompts and options, showing that
all methods exhibit large variances under input perturbations. We also
introduce two tasks studying whether the values are responsive to demographic
context, and how well they align with the models' behaviors in value-related
scenarios. We show that the demographic context has little effect on the
free-text generation, and the models' values only weakly correlate with their
preference for value-based actions. Our work highlights the need for a more
careful examination of LLM value probing and awareness of its limitations.

### [12] [Encoding syntactic objects and Merge operations in function spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13501)
*Matilde Marcolli,Robert C. Berwick*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种数学方法，将词汇项表示为函数空间中的函数（如小波），并构建了任意句法对象的忠实表示。该方法基于第二Renyi熵构建了非结合半环结构，并展示了句法对象的表示与magma结构的兼容性。结果证明了句法核心计算结构的神经计算实现的理论可能性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过数学方法验证句法结构的神经计算实现的可能性，并探索句法操作（如Merge）在函数空间中的表示。

Method: 利用函数空间中的函数表示词汇项，构建非结合半环结构，并通过操作模型电路转换输入波形以编码句法结构。Merge操作通过Hopf代数马尔可夫链实现。

Result: 证明了句法结构的神经计算实现的理论可能性，并通过具体案例展示了Merge操作的正弦波跨频率相位同步实现。

Conclusion: 研究为句法核心计算结构的神经计算实现提供了理论支持，并揭示了Merge操作与算术后继函数的相似性。

Abstract: We provide a mathematical argument showing that, given a representation of
lexical items as functions (wavelets, for instance) in some function space, it
is possible to construct a faithful representation of arbitrary syntactic
objects in the same function space. This space can be endowed with a
commutative non-associative semiring structure built using the second Renyi
entropy. The resulting representation of syntactic objects is compatible with
the magma structure. The resulting set of functions is an algebra over an
operad, where the operations in the operad model circuits that transform the
input wave forms into a combined output that encodes the syntactic structure.
The action of Merge on workspaces is faithfully implemented as action on these
circuits, through a coproduct and a Hopf algebra Markov chain. The results
obtained here provide a constructive argument showing the theoretical
possibility of a neurocomputational realization of the core computational
structure of syntax. We also present a particular case of this general
construction where this type of realization of Merge is implemented as a cross
frequency phase synchronization on sinusoidal waves. This also shows that Merge
can be expressed in terms of the successor function of a semiring, thus
clarifying the well known observation of its similarities with the successor
function of arithmetic.

Result: 结合大型语言模型和该技术，语义度量S提升了2.06倍，同时实现了树状结构和0δ-双曲性。

Conclusion: 该工作为分析大规模对话数据集提供了计算方法，适用于监控聊天机器人等自动化系统。

Abstract: The analysis of conversational dynamics has gained increasing importance with
the rise of large language model-based systems, which interact with users
across diverse contexts. In this work, we propose a novel computational
framework for constructing conversational graphs that capture the flow and
structure of loosely organized dialogues, referred to as quasi-patterned
conversations. We introduce the Filter & Reconnect method, a novel graph
simplification technique that minimizes noise while preserving semantic
coherence and structural integrity of conversational graphs. Through
comparative analysis, we demonstrate that the use of large language models
combined with our graph simplification technique has resulted in semantic
metric S increasing by a factor of 2.06 compared to previous approaches while
simultaneously enforcing a tree-like structure with 0 {\delta}-hyperbolicity,
ensuring optimal clarity in conversation modeling. This work provides a
computational method for analyzing large-scale dialogue datasets, with
practical applications related to monitoring automated systems such as
chatbots, dialogue management tools, and user behavior analytics.

TL;DR: 研究通过整合暂停特征和语义连贯性指标，评估了自动语音识别（ASR）在预测形式思维障碍（FTD）严重程度中的效用，发现暂停特征能有效预测FTD，且与语义指标结合可进一步提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统临床评分量表资源密集且难以扩展，而ASR提供的客观语音分析为FTD评估提供了可扩展的替代方案。

Method: 研究整合了暂停特征和语义连贯性指标，使用支持向量回归（SVR）预测临床FTD评分，评估了三个数据集（AVH、TOPSY、PsyCL）。

Result: 暂停特征单独预测FTD严重程度效果显著，与语义指标结合后性能进一步提升，相关性最高达0.649，AUC为83.71%。

Conclusion: 结合时间和语义分析的框架为改进精神障碍中语言紊乱的评估提供了方向，并推动了自动语音分析在精神病学中的应用。

Abstract: Formal thought disorder (FTD), a hallmark of schizophrenia spectrum
disorders, manifests as incoherent speech and poses challenges for clinical
assessment. Traditional clinical rating scales, though validated, are
resource-intensive and lack scalability. Automated speech analysis with
automatic speech recognition (ASR) allows for objective quantification of
linguistic and temporal features of speech, offering scalable alternatives. The
use of utterance timestamps in ASR captures pause dynamics, which are thought
to reflect the cognitive processes underlying speech production. However, the
utility of integrating these ASR-derived features for assessing FTD severity
requires further evaluation. This study integrates pause features with semantic
coherence metrics across three datasets: naturalistic self-recorded diaries
(AVH, n = 140), structured picture descriptions (TOPSY, n = 72), and dream
narratives (PsyCL, n = 43). We evaluated pause related features alongside
established coherence measures, using support vector regression (SVR) to
predict clinical FTD scores. Key findings demonstrate that pause features alone
robustly predict the severity of FTD. Integrating pause features with semantic
coherence metrics enhanced predictive performance compared to semantic-only
models, with integration of independent models achieving correlations up to
\r{ho} = 0.649 and AUC = 83.71% for severe cases detection (TOPSY, with best
\r{ho} = 0.584 and AUC = 79.23% for semantic-only models). The performance
gains from semantic and pause features integration held consistently across all
contexts, though the nature of pause patterns was dataset-dependent. These
findings suggest that frameworks combining temporal and semantic analyses
provide a roadmap for refining the assessment of disorganized speech and
advance automated speech analysis in psychosis.

TL;DR: 该研究通过多语言特征分析人类与机器生成文本的差异，发现人类文本句法更简单、语义更多样，且新模型生成文本风格趋同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人类与机器生成文本在语言特征上的差异，填补现有研究空白。

Method: 选择8个领域的文本数据集，计算依赖长度、情感等语言特征，结合统计分析和风格嵌入。

Result: 人类文本句法更简单、语义更多样；新模型生成文本风格趋同。

Conclusion: 机器生成文本风格逐渐趋同，人类文本更具多样性。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved their ability to generate natural language, making texts generated by
LLMs increasingly indistinguishable from human-written texts. While recent
research has primarily focused on using LLMs to classify text as either
human-written and machine-generated texts, our study focus on characterizing
these texts using a set of linguistic features across different linguistic
levels such as morphology, syntax, and semantics. We select a dataset of
human-written and machine-generated texts spanning 8 domains and produced by 11
different LLMs. We calculate different linguistic features such as dependency
length and emotionality and we use them for characterizing human-written and
machine-generated texts along with different sampling strategies, repetition
controls and model release date. Our statistical analysis reveals that
human-written texts tend to exhibit simpler syntactic structures and more
diverse semantic content. Furthermore, we calculate the variability of our set
of features across models and domains. Both human and machine texts show
stylistic diversity across domains, with humans displaying greater variation in
our features. Finally, we apply style embeddings to further test variability
among human-written and machine-generated texts. Notably, newer models output
text that is similarly variable, pointing to an homogenization of
machine-generated texts.

Result: 在28种语言中表现媲美Gemini-2.5和GPT-4o，显著优于其他开源模型。

Conclusion: Seed-X为翻译研究和应用提供了高效开源解决方案。

Abstract: Multilingual translation stands as a challenging task for large language
models (LLMs) to handle intricate language patterns and stilted translations
that arise in automated translations. In this paper, we introduce Seed-X, a
family of open-source LLMs comprising instruct and reasoning models, pushing
the limits of translation capability with 7B parameter size. The base model is
pre-trained on a diverse, high-quality dataset encompassing both monolingual
and bilingual content across 28 languages, harnessing the full potential of
multilingual data. The instruct model is then finetuned to translate by
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and further enhanced through reinforcement
learning (RL) to achieve better generalization across diverse language pairs.
Seed-X achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models,
including Gemini-2.5 and GPT-4o, across 28 languages, and significantly
outperforms larger open-source models in both automatic metrics and human
evaluations. We share the best practices through our optimization process, and
make the parameter public available for advancing translation research and
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将大语言模型应用于医疗领域时，面临领域适应和标注数据不足的挑战，需要高效且低开销的解决方案。

Method: 采用T5架构，结合少样本提示和选择性参数更新的稀疏微调方法，实现高效适应。

Result: 在ICU任务中，CU-ICU提升了15%的败血症检测准确率和20%的临床解释生成能力，同时仅更新不到1%的参数。

Conclusion: CU-ICU为ICU环境提供了一种可扩展、低开销的临床决策支持方案。

Abstract: Integrating large language models into specialized domains like healthcare
presents unique challenges, including domain adaptation and limited labeled
data. We introduce CU-ICU, a method for customizing unsupervised
instruction-finetuned language models for ICU datasets by leveraging the
Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) architecture. CU-ICU employs a sparse
fine-tuning approach that combines few-shot prompting with selective parameter
updates, enabling efficient adaptation with minimal supervision. Our evaluation
across critical ICU tasks--early sepsis detection, mortality prediction, and
clinical note generation--demonstrates that CU-ICU consistently improves
predictive accuracy and interpretability over standard fine-tuning methods.
Notably, CU-ICU achieves up to a 15% increase in sepsis detection accuracy and
a 20% enhancement in generating clinically relevant explanations while updating
fewer than 1% of model parameters in its most efficient configuration. These
results establish CU-ICU as a scalable, low-overhead solution for delivering
accurate and interpretable clinical decision support in real-world ICU
environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KiC框架通过语义对齐评估，优化级联方法，显著降低API成本，同时保持高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有级联方法在自由文本生成中因依赖精确文本匹配而无法可靠选择代表答案的问题。

Method: 提出Keyword-inspired Cascade (KiC)，通过识别弱模型输出的代表答案并评估其他响应的语义对齐程度，决定是否接受或升级到强模型。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，KiC达到GPT-4 97.53%的准确率，平均降低28.81%的API成本，并在特定基准中超越GPT-4。

Conclusion: KiC是一种高效且经济的自由文本生成框架，显著提升了级联方法的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance
across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However,
high-performing models are typically accessible only via APIs, incurring
substantial inference costs. Cascade methods address this by initially
employing a cheaper model and escalating to a stronger one only when necessary.
Nevertheless, existing cascade approaches struggle to select a reliable
representative response and assess the overall reliability of free-form
outputs, as they rely on exact text matching. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Keyword-inspired Cascade (KiC), a novel framework for cost-efficient
free-form text generation. KiC identifies the most representative answer among
multiple outputs from a weaker model and evaluates the semantic alignment of
other responses with it. Based on the degree of alignment, KiC determines
whether to accept the weaker model's output or escalate to a stronger model.
Experiments on three free-form text generation benchmarks show that KiC
achieves 97.53 percent of GPT-4's accuracy while reducing API costs by 28.81
percent on average, and even outperforms GPT-4 in a specific benchmark.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LoopServe是一个用于多轮对话中大型语言模型的自适应双阶段推理加速框架，通过动态稀疏化和渐进键值压缩提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有模型在长对话历史中计算和内存效率低下的问题。

Method: 采用在线稀疏化和渐进键值压缩技术。

Result: 在多个长上下文对话任务中表现优于现有基线，显著加速推理。

Conclusion: LoopServe为多轮对话中的LLM提供了高效且自适应的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-turn dialogues are essential in many real-world applications of large
language models, such as chatbots and virtual assistants. As conversation
histories become longer, existing large language models face increasing
computational and memory challenges, which hinder their ability to provide
efficient and responsive interactions. Most current acceleration methods either
compress the context or optimize key value caching, but they often rely on
fixed or position-based heuristics that do not adapt well to the dynamic and
unpredictable patterns found in actual multi-turn conversations. In this paper,
we present LoopServe, an adaptive dual-phase inference acceleration framework
for large language models in multi-turn dialogues. LoopServe introduces two
main innovations. First, it performs online sparsification during the
prefilling phase by dynamically selecting the most important parts of the
attention matrix for each new input. Second, it uses progressive key value
compression during decoding by adaptively maintaining a relevant and efficient
cache based on the most recently generated output tokens. We also propose a
\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/TreeAILab/Multi-turn_Long-context_Benchmark_for_LLMs}{new
benchmark} with eleven multi-turn datasets that reflect realistic query
positions and conversational dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that LoopServe consistently achieves superior effectiveness compared to
existing baselines and significantly accelerates LLM inference across a wide
range of long-context dialogue tasks.

TL;DR: 论文评估了LLMs在群体推荐系统（GRS）中的表现，发现其推荐与ADD聚合类似，但解释常涉及评分平均。LLMs还引入了额外标准，如多样性或相似性，但解释不一致，影响了透明性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在GRS中作为决策者和解释生成器的表现，并与基于社会选择的聚合策略进行比较。

Method: 比较LLM生成的推荐和解释与ADD聚合策略的结果，分析群体结构和额外标准的影响。

Result: LLM推荐与ADD聚合相似，解释常涉及评分平均；额外标准依赖评分数量，解释不一致。

Conclusion: LLMs在GRS中的应用需改进透明性和解释一致性，标准聚合方法在大规模项目集上可能效率不足。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being implemented as joint
decision-makers and explanation generators for Group Recommender Systems (GRS).
In this paper, we evaluate these recommendations and explanations by comparing
them to social choice-based aggregation strategies. Our results indicate that
LLM-generated recommendations often resembled those produced by Additive
Utilitarian (ADD) aggregation. However, the explanations typically referred to
averaging ratings (resembling but not identical to ADD aggregation). Group
structure, uniform or divergent, did not impact the recommendations.
Furthermore, LLMs regularly claimed additional criteria such as user or item
similarity, diversity, or used undefined popularity metrics or thresholds. Our
findings have important implications for LLMs in the GRS pipeline as well as
standard aggregation strategies. Additional criteria in explanations were
dependent on the number of ratings in the group scenario, indicating potential
inefficiency of standard aggregation methods at larger item set sizes.
Additionally, inconsistent and ambiguous explanations undermine transparency
and explainability, which are key motivations behind the use of LLMs for GRS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战法官是中立的假设，探讨法官个人决策模式是否显著影响案件结果。

Method: 使用18,937份判决数据，结合LLM和ML模型（RF、XGB、SVC），比较法官专用模型与通用模型的预测效果。

Result: 法官专用模型预测准确率更高（F1 92.85% vs 通用模型82.63%），证明法官身份对判决有显著影响。

Conclusion: 研究支持法律现实主义，法官个人决策模式对法律结果有可测量的影响。

Abstract: This study examines the role of human judges in legal decision-making by
using machine learning to predict child physical custody outcomes in French
appellate courts. Building on the legal realism-formalism debate, we test
whether individual judges' decision-making patterns significantly influence
case outcomes, challenging the assumption that judges are neutral variables
that apply the law uniformly. To ensure compliance with French privacy laws, we
implement a strict pseudonymization process. Our analysis uses 18,937 living
arrangements rulings extracted from 10,306 cases. We compare models trained on
individual judges' past rulings (specialist models) with a judge-agnostic model
trained on aggregated data (generalist models). The prediction pipeline is a
hybrid approach combining large language models (LLMs) for structured feature
extraction and ML models for outcome prediction (RF, XGB and SVC). Our results
show that specialist models consistently achieve higher predictive accuracy
than the general model, with top-performing models reaching F1 scores as high
as 92.85%, compared to the generalist model's 82.63% trained on 20x to 100x
more samples. Specialist models capture stable individual patterns that are not
transferable to other judges. In-Domain and Cross-Domain validity tests provide
empirical support for legal realism, demonstrating that judicial identity plays
a measurable role in legal outcomes. All data and code used will be made
available.

*Maluna Menke,Thilo Hagendorff*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过参数高效微调技术（如LoRA和软提示调优）减少大型语言模型（LLMs）中的性别和性取向偏见，并展示了LoRA在显著降低偏见分数方面的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs常再现训练数据中的性别和性取向偏见，导致对LGBTQIA+用户的边缘化输出，因此减少此类偏见至关重要。

Method: 评估了两种参数高效微调技术（LoRA和软提示调优）作为轻量级替代方案，使用WinoQueer基准量化偏见，并在QueerNews语料库上进行微调。

Result: LoRA（<0.1%额外参数）将偏见分数降低多达50点，中立性从接近0%提升至36%；软提示调优效果有限。

Conclusion: LoRA能以最小计算成本显著提升公平性，建议更广泛采用社区驱动的参数高效微调技术，并呼吁创建更多LGBTQIA+作者语料库和更丰富的评估工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently reproduce the gender- and
sexual-identity prejudices embedded in their training corpora, leading to
outputs that marginalize LGBTQIA+ users. Hence, reducing such biases is of
great importance. To achieve this, we evaluate two parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques - Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and soft-prompt
tuning - as lightweight alternatives to full-model fine-tuning for mitigating
such biases. Using the WinoQueer benchmark, we quantify bias in three
open-source LLMs and observe baseline bias scores reaching up to 98 (out of
100) across a range of queer identities defined by gender and/or sexual
orientation, where 50 would indicate neutrality. Fine-tuning with LoRA (< 0.1%
additional parameters) on a curated QueerNews corpus reduces those scores by up
to 50 points and raises neutrality from virtually 0% to as much as 36%.
Soft-prompt tuning (10 virtual tokens) delivers only marginal improvements.
These findings show that LoRA can deliver meaningful fairness gains with
minimal computation. We advocate broader adoption of community-informed PEFT,
the creation of larger queer-authored corpora, and richer evaluation suites
beyond WinoQueer, coupled with ongoing audits to keep LLMs inclusive.

Motivation: 探索提示敏感性如何被利用生成不适当内容，特别是在视觉语言模型中。

Method: 分析了三个关键因素对越狱成功的影响，并提出了一种基于内部层跳连接的框架。

Result: 发现多模态环境下模型能力下降，三个因素均可独立触发越狱，且少量上下文示例即可引发不适当输出。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型存在复杂且细微的漏洞，即使是看似无害的内容（如表情包）也可能引发有害输出。

Abstract: Language models are highly sensitive to prompt formulations - small changes
in input can drastically alter their output. This raises a critical question:
To what extent can prompt sensitivity be exploited to generate inapt content?
In this paper, we investigate how discrete components of prompt design
influence the generation of inappropriate content in Visual Language Models
(VLMs). Specifically, we analyze the impact of three key factors on successful
jailbreaks: (a) the inclusion of detailed visual information, (b) the presence
of adversarial examples, and (c) the use of positively framed beginning
phrases. Our findings reveal that while a VLM can reliably distinguish between
benign and harmful inputs in unimodal settings (text-only or image-only), this
ability significantly degrades in multimodal contexts. Each of the three
factors is independently capable of triggering a jailbreak, and we show that
even a small number of in-context examples (as few as three) can push the model
toward generating inappropriate outputs. Furthermore, we propose a framework
that utilizes a skip-connection between two internal layers of the VLM, which
substantially increases jailbreak success rates, even when using benign images.
Finally, we demonstrate that memes, often perceived as humorous or harmless,
can be as effective as toxic visuals in eliciting harmful content, underscoring
the subtle and complex vulnerabilities of VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 短文本聚类在社交媒体时代日益重要，但现有方法面临稀疏性、高维度和计算效率的挑战。

Method: 提出GSDMM+算法，通过减少初始化噪声、自适应调整词权重和策略性合并簇来优化性能。

Result: 实验表明GSDMM+在效率和效果上优于经典和最新方法。

Conclusion: GSDMM+是一种高效且有效的短文本聚类方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: Short text clustering has become increasingly important with the popularity
of social media like Twitter, Google+, and Facebook. Existing methods can be
broadly categorized into two paradigms: topic model-based approaches and deep
representation learning-based approaches. This task is inherently challenging
due to the sparse, large-scale, and high-dimensional characteristics of the
short text data. Furthermore, the computational intensity required by
representation learning significantly increases the running time. To address
these issues, we propose a collapsed Gibbs Sampling algorithm for the Dirichlet
Multinomial Mixture model (GSDMM), which effectively handles the sparsity and
high dimensionality of short texts while identifying representative words for
each cluster. Based on several aspects of GSDMM that warrant further
refinement, we propose an improved approach, GSDMM+, designed to further
optimize its performance. GSDMM+ reduces initialization noise and adaptively
adjusts word weights based on entropy, achieving fine-grained clustering that
reveals more topic-related information. Additionally, strategic cluster merging
is employed to refine clustering granularity, better aligning the predicted
distribution with the true category distribution. We conduct extensive
experiments, comparing our methods with both classical and state-of-the-art
approaches. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and
effectiveness of our methods. The source code for our model is publicly
available at https://github.com/chehaoa/VEMC.

Method: 1. 基于文章内容的方法：选择重要段落，用LLM生成问题并排序，再生成答案。2. 基于知识图谱的方法：构建知识图谱，提取关键三元组生成问答对。

Result: 知识图谱方法能更有效地捕捉文章的主要思想，且ER提取模型的微调对高质量三元组提取至关重要。

Conclusion: 知识图谱方法优于纯内容方法，且微调ER提取模型是成功的关键。

Abstract: When deciding to read an article or incorporate it into their research,
scholars often seek to quickly identify and understand its main ideas. In this
paper, we aim to extract these key concepts and contributions from scientific
articles in the form of Question and Answer (QA) pairs. We propose two distinct
approaches for generating QAs. The first approach involves selecting salient
paragraphs, using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate questions, ranking
these questions by the likelihood of obtaining meaningful answers, and
subsequently generating answers. This method relies exclusively on the content
of the articles. However, assessing an article's novelty typically requires
comparison with the existing literature. Therefore, our second approach
leverages a Knowledge Graph (KG) for QA generation. We construct a KG by
fine-tuning an Entity Relationship (ER) extraction model on scientific articles
and using it to build the graph. We then employ a salient triplet extraction
method to select the most pertinent ERs per article, utilizing metrics such as
the centrality of entities based on a triplet TF-IDF-like measure. This measure
assesses the saliency of a triplet based on its importance within the article
compared to its prevalence in the literature. For evaluation, we generate QAs
using both approaches and have them assessed by Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)
through a set of predefined metrics to evaluate the quality of both questions
and answers. Our evaluations demonstrate that the KG-based approach effectively
captures the main ideas discussed in the articles. Furthermore, our findings
indicate that fine-tuning the ER extraction model on our scientific corpus is
crucial for extracting high-quality triplets from such documents.

Result: 负面情绪词频率与抑郁和焦虑状态严重程度显著正相关，第一人称单数代词使用频率无显著变化。

Conclusion: 文化背景和心理咨询互动动态对语言使用有重要影响，为中文人群的心理治疗提供了新的语言学标记。

Abstract: This study explores the relationship between linguistic expressions and
psychological states of depression and anxiety within Chinese psycho-counseling
interactions, focusing specifically on the usage of first-person singular
pronouns and negative emotional words. Utilizing a corpus derived from 735
online counseling sessions, the analysis employed a general linear mixed-effect
model to assess linguistic patterns quantified by the Linguistic Inquiry and
Word Count (LIWC) software. Results indicate a significant positive correlation
between the frequency of negative emotional words and the severity of both
depressive and anxious states among clients. However, contrary to prior
findings predominantly derived from English-language contexts, the usage
frequency of first-person singular pronouns did not vary significantly with the
clients' psychological conditions. These outcomes are discussed within the
framework of cultural distinctions between collectivist Chinese contexts and
individualistic Western settings, as well as the interactive dynamics unique to
psycho-counseling conversations. The findings highlight the nuanced influence
of cultural and conversational contexts on language use in mental health
communications, providing insights into psycholinguistic markers relevant to
therapeutic practices in Chinese-speaking populations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 侦探小说中的公平性（fair play）是作者与读者之间的隐性协议，本文旨在通过概率框架量化这一概念。

Method: 提出概率框架，定义公平性并设计指标，分析LLM生成的侦探故事。

Result: LLM生成的故事在惊喜与公平性之间缺乏平衡，质量较差。

Conclusion: LLM生成的故事需改进以平衡惊喜与公平性，提升质量。

Abstract: Effective storytelling relies on a delicate balance between meeting the
reader's prior expectations and introducing unexpected developments. In the
domain of detective fiction, this tension is known as fair play, which includes
the implicit agreement between the writer and the reader as to the range of
possible resolutions the mystery story may have. In this work, we present a
probabilistic framework for detective fiction that allows us to define desired
qualities. Using this framework, we formally define fair play and design
appropriate metrics for it. Stemming from these definitions is an inherent
tension between the coherence of the story, which measures how much it ``makes
sense'', and the surprise it induces. We validate the framework by applying it
to LLM-generated detective stories. This domain is appealing since we have an
abundance of data, we can sample from the distribution generating the story,
and the story-writing capabilities of LLMs are interesting in their own right.
Results show that while LLM-generated stories may be unpredictable, they
generally fail to balance the trade-off between surprise and fair play, which
greatly contributes to their poor quality.

Conclusion: InTraVisTo为理解LLM的内部推理过程提供了新视角。

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have increased
greatly over the last few years, as have their size and complexity.
Nonetheless, the use of LLMs in production remains challenging due to their
unpredictable nature and discrepancies that can exist between their desired
behavior and their actual model output. In this paper, we introduce a new tool,
InTraVisTo (Inside Transformer Visualisation Tool), designed to enable
researchers to investigate and trace the computational process that generates
each token in a Transformer-based LLM. InTraVisTo provides a visualization of
both the internal state of the Transformer model (by decoding token embeddings
at each layer of the model) and the information flow between the various
components across the different layers of the model (using a Sankey diagram).
With InTraVisTo, we aim to help researchers and practitioners better understand
the computations being performed within the Transformer model and thus to shed
some light on internal patterns and reasoning processes employed by LLMs.

Result: 统一数据集训练的模型泛化能力差，多头模型改进有限，基于图的转移模型性能未显著提升。

Conclusion: 标签统一存在局限性，需要进一步研究更有效的模型架构。

Abstract: The field of cybersecurity NER lacks standardized labels, making it
challenging to combine datasets. We investigate label unification across four
cybersecurity datasets to increase data resource usability. We perform a
coarse-grained label unification and conduct pairwise cross-dataset evaluations
using BiLSTM models. Qualitative analysis of predictions reveals errors,
limitations, and dataset differences. To address unification limitations, we
propose alternative architectures including a multihead model and a graph-based
transfer model. Results show that models trained on unified datasets generalize
poorly across datasets. The multihead model with weight sharing provides only
marginal improvements over unified training, while our graph-based transfer
model built on BERT-base-NER shows no significant performance gains compared

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语码转换（CS）在自动语音识别（ASR）中面临训练数据稀缺和语言相似性挑战，尤其在多语言社会中普遍存在。

Method: 采用三种策略：生成合成CS数据、拼接单语音频、利用真实CS数据加语言标记，并基于Whisper模型微调。

Result: 结合少量合成CS数据与主要语言标记的模型表现最佳。

Conclusion: 合成数据与语言标记结合是提升CS-ASR性能的有效方法。

Abstract: Code-switching (CS), the alternating use of two or more languages, challenges
automatic speech recognition (ASR) due to scarce training data and linguistic
similarities. The lack of dedicated CS datasets limits ASR performance, as most
models rely on monolingual or mixed-language corpora that fail to reflect
real-world CS patterns. This issue is critical in multilingual societies where
CS occurs in informal and formal settings. A key example is Catalan-Spanish CS,
widely used in media and parliamentary speeches. In this work, we improve ASR
for Catalan-Spanish CS by exploring three strategies: (1) generating synthetic
CS data, (2) concatenating monolingual audio, and (3) leveraging real CS data
with language tokens. We extract CS data from Catalan speech corpora and
fine-tune OpenAI's Whisper models, making them available on Hugging Face.
Results show that combining a modest amount of synthetic CS data with the
dominant language token yields the best transcription performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用大语言模型（LLMs）从情境判断测试（SJTs）回答中提取相关特征的新方法，以解决传统人工评分在规模化应用中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术项目日益重视个人和专业技能，但传统SJTs依赖人工评分，难以规模化。需要可靠且自动化的评分系统。

Method: 采用大语言模型（LLMs）从SJT回答中提取构造相关特征，并以Casper SJT为例验证方法有效性。

Result: 研究表明该方法为个人和专业技能的自动化评分奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 新方法为解决SJTs规模化评分问题提供了可行路径，未来可进一步优化和发展。

Abstract: Academic programs are increasingly recognizing the importance of personal and
professional skills and their critical role alongside technical expertise in
preparing students for future success in diverse career paths. With this
growing demand comes the need for scalable systems to measure, evaluate, and
develop these skills. Situational Judgment Tests (SJTs) offer one potential
avenue for measuring these skills in a standardized and reliable way, but
open-response SJTs have traditionally relied on trained human raters for
evaluation, presenting operational challenges to delivering SJTs at scale. Past
attempts at developing NLP-based scoring systems for SJTs have fallen short due
to issues with construct validity of these systems. In this article, we explore
a novel approach to extracting construct-relevant features from SJT responses
using large language models (LLMs). We use the Casper SJT to demonstrate the
efficacy of this approach. This study sets the foundation for future
developments in automated scoring for personal and professional skills.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Transformer模型的文本政治倾向和政治性自动分类方法，通过整合数据集和改进模型泛化能力来解决现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在分布外文本上表现不佳，且数据集和模型分散，缺乏统一解决方案。

Method: 整合12个政治倾向分类数据集，并扩展18个现有数据集以创建新的政治性分类数据集；采用留一法和留出法进行基准测试，训练具有更好泛化能力的新模型。

Result: 通过实验验证了新模型在泛化能力上的提升，特别是在分布外文本上的表现。

Conclusion: 研究提供了一种更全面的数据集和模型框架，显著提升了政治文本分类的泛化性能。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of automatically classifying text
according to political leaning and politicalness using transformer models. We
compose a comprehensive overview of existing datasets and models for these
tasks, finding that current approaches create siloed solutions that perform
poorly on out-of-distribution texts. To address this limitation, we compile a
diverse dataset by combining 12 datasets for political leaning classification
and creating a new dataset for politicalness by extending 18 existing datasets
with the appropriate label. Through extensive benchmarking with leave-one-in
and leave-one-out methodologies, we evaluate the performance of existing models
and train new ones with enhanced generalization capabilities.

TL;DR: 研究发现，当前和近期的AI说服力主要来自后训练和提示方法，而非模型规模或个性化，但这些方法在提高说服力的同时降低了事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估对话AI对人类信念的潜在影响，特别是其在政治议题上的说服力和事实准确性。

Method: 通过三个大规模实验（N=76,977），测试19个LLM在707个政治议题上的说服力，并检查466,769个LLM声称的事实准确性。

Result: 后训练和提示方法分别将说服力提升51%和27%，但同时也降低了事实准确性。

Conclusion: AI的说服力更多依赖于后训练和提示方法，但这些方法可能以牺牲事实准确性为代价。

Abstract: There are widespread fears that conversational AI could soon exert
unprecedented influence over human beliefs. Here, in three large-scale
experiments (N=76,977), we deployed 19 LLMs-including some post-trained
explicitly for persuasion-to evaluate their persuasiveness on 707 political
issues. We then checked the factual accuracy of 466,769 resulting LLM claims.
Contrary to popular concerns, we show that the persuasive power of current and
near-future AI is likely to stem more from post-training and prompting
methods-which boosted persuasiveness by as much as 51% and 27%
respectively-than from personalization or increasing model scale. We further
show that these methods increased persuasion by exploiting LLMs' unique ability
to rapidly access and strategically deploy information and that, strikingly,
where they increased AI persuasiveness they also systematically decreased
factual accuracy.

resource-constrained academic settings. We detail the system architecture,
provide a technical evaluation of its components, and report insights from a

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在MCQA中的首因效应及其对答案准确性的影响。

Method: 通过重新排序选项基于语义相似性，无需正确答案知识。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著提升MCQA性能。

Conclusion: 偏见既是挑战也是机遇，为偏见过滤模型设计提供见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become essential in many Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tasks, leveraging extensive pre-training and fine-tuning to
achieve high accuracy. However, like humans, LLMs exhibit biases, particularly
positional biases such as primacy and recency effects, which can influence the
accuracy of the answers. The primacy effect-where items presented first are
more likely to be remembered or selected-plays a key role in Multiple Choice
Question Answering (MCQA), where the order of answer options can affect
prediction outcomes. This study focuses on primacy bias in fine-tuned LLMs: We
first show that fine-tuning amplifies this bias, probably due to exposure to
human-like patterns. Hence, we strategically leverage this effect by reordering
response options based on semantic similarity to the query, without requiring
knowledge of the correct answer. Our experimental results show that this
approach significantly improves performance in MCQA. More generally, our
findings underscore the dual nature of biases as both challenges and
opportunities, offering insights for bias-aware model design and NLP
applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于知识图谱（KG）的任务生成方法，通过组合领域概念训练语言模型，实现领域特定超级智能。在医学领域验证了QwQ-Med-3模型的优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言模型在跨领域泛化中表现不足，缺乏深度领域专业知识。通过知识图谱的组合性结构，可以构建更复杂的领域概念。

Method: 利用知识图谱生成任务，训练语言模型组合领域概念。在医学领域验证，并开发了评估套件ICD-Bench。

Result: QwQ-Med-3在ICD-Bench上显著优于现有模型，并能将专业知识迁移到其他任务。

Conclusion: 领域特定超级智能的组合可能是实现通用人工智能（AGI）的新途径。

Abstract: Language models traditionally used for cross-domain generalization have
recently demonstrated task-specific reasoning. However, their top-down training
approach on general corpora is insufficient for acquiring abstractions needed
for deep domain expertise. This may require a bottom-up approach that acquires
expertise by learning to compose simple domain concepts into more complex ones.
A knowledge graph (KG) provides this compositional structure, where domain
primitives are represented as head-relation-tail edges and their paths encode
higher-level concepts. We present a task generation pipeline that synthesizes
tasks directly from KG primitives, enabling models to acquire and compose them
for reasoning. We fine-tune language models on the resultant KG-grounded
curriculum to demonstrate domain-specific superintelligence. While broadly
applicable, we validate our approach in medicine, where reliable KGs exist.
Using a medical KG, we curate 24,000 reasoning tasks paired with thinking
traces derived from diverse medical primitives. We fine-tune the QwQ-32B model
on this curriculum to obtain QwQ-Med-3 that takes a step towards medical
superintelligence. We also introduce ICD-Bench, an evaluation suite to quantify
reasoning abilities across 15 medical domains. Our experiments demonstrate that
QwQ-Med-3 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning models on
ICD-Bench categories. Further analysis reveals that QwQ-Med-3 utilizes acquired
primitives to widen the performance gap on the hardest tasks of ICD-Bench.
Finally, evaluation on medical question-answer benchmarks shows that QwQ-Med-3
transfers acquired expertise to enhance the base model's performance. While the
industry's approach to artificial general intelligence (AGI) emphasizes broad
expertise, we envision a future in which AGI emerges from the composable
interaction of efficient domain-specific superintelligent agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语自动语音识别（ASR）系统发展面临挑战，尤其是语言复杂性和方言多样性。现有研究多集中于现代标准阿拉伯语（MSA），而对其他变体关注不足。

Method: 提出通用方法处理阿拉伯语语音和文本，基于FastConformer架构训练两个模型：一个针对MSA，另一个统一处理MSA和CA。

Result: MSA模型在相关数据集上达到SOTA性能；统一模型在CA带音标任务中表现优异，同时保持MSA的强性能。

Conclusion: 论文方法有效解决了阿拉伯语ASR的独特挑战，开源模型和训练方法以促进可重复性。

Abstract: Despite Arabic being one of the most widely spoken languages, the development
of Arabic Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems faces significant
challenges due to the language's complexity, and only a limited number of
public Arabic ASR models exist. While much of the focus has been on Modern
Standard Arabic (MSA), there is considerably less attention given to the
variations within the language. This paper introduces a universal methodology
for Arabic speech and text processing designed to address unique challenges of
the language. Using this methodology, we train two novel models based on the
FastConformer architecture: one designed specifically for MSA and the other,
the first unified public model for both MSA and Classical Arabic (CA). The MSA
model sets a new benchmark with state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on related
datasets, while the unified model achieves SOTA accuracy with diacritics for CA
while maintaining strong performance for MSA. To promote reproducibility, we
open-source the models and their training recipes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法在捕捉时空依赖性和计算效率上的不足。

Method: 将轨迹分割为每日段，编码为离散标记，利用分层注意力捕获依赖关系，并通过冻结的LLM增强表示。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，准确性提升2.4%，周末提升5.0%，训练时间减少24.6%。

Conclusion: RHYTHM在效率和性能上均优于现有方法，展示了LLM在时空预测中的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce RHYTHM (Reasoning with Hierarchical Temporal Tokenization for
Human Mobility), a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as
spatio-temporal predictors and trajectory reasoners. RHYTHM partitions
trajectories into daily segments encoded as discrete tokens with hierarchical
attention, capturing both daily and weekly dependencies while substantially
reducing the sequence length. Token representations are enriched with
pre-computed prompt embeddings via a frozen LLM, enhancing the model's ability
to capture interdependencies without extensive computational overhead. By
freezing the LLM backbone, RHYTHM achieves significant computational
efficiency. Evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates a 2.4%
improvement in accuracy, 5.0% increase on weekends, and 24.6% reduction in
training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文档级情感分析中模型选择的问题，通过综合评估多个标准来优化模型性能。

Method: 使用CPC计算评估标准权重，构建加权决策矩阵，比较多种基线模型（如Naive Bayes、LSVC、ALBERT等）在三个社交媒体数据集上的表现。

Result: ALBERT在排除时间因素时表现最佳；若考虑时间消耗，则无单一模型始终最优。

Conclusion: CPC-CMS可推广至其他分类应用领域。

Abstract: This study proposes the Cognitive Pairwise Comparison Classification Model
Selection (CPC-CMS) framework for document-level sentiment analysis. The CPC,
based on expert knowledge judgment, is used to calculate the weights of
evaluation criteria, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score,
specificity, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), Cohen's Kappa (Kappa), and
efficiency. Naive Bayes, Linear Support Vector Classification (LSVC), Random
Forest, Logistic Regression, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and A Lite Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (ALBERT) are chosen as classification baseline models. A weighted
decision matrix consisting of classification evaluation scores with respect to
criteria weights, is formed to select the best classification model for a
classification problem. Three open datasets of social media are used to
demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed CPC-CMS. Based on our simulation,
for evaluation results excluding the time factor, ALBERT is the best for the
three datasets; if time consumption is included, no single model always
performs better than the other models. The CPC-CMS can be applied to the other
classification applications in different areas.

Result: 没有单一LLM在所有任务中表现最佳，不同模型在不同任务中表现优异；开源模型在某些任务中表现更好且具有更快推理和隐私优势。

Conclusion: 研究结果为选择适合特定生物医学应用的LLM提供了重要参考。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of cost-efficient Large

image modalities. We evaluated a range of closed-source and open-source LLMs on
tasks such as biomedical text classification and generation, question
answering, and multimodal image processing. Our experimental findings indicate
that there is no single LLM that can consistently outperform others across all
tasks. Instead, different LLMs excel in different tasks. While some
closed-source LLMs demonstrate strong performance on specific tasks, their
open-source counterparts achieve comparable results (sometimes even better),
with additional benefits like faster inference and enhanced privacy. Our
experimental results offer valuable insights for selecting models that are
optimally suited for specific biomedical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统在协作角色中需要推理共享目标和信念，而现有RSA扩展在多轮协作场景中面临挑战。

Method: 引入CRSA框架，通过优化基于率失真理论的增益函数，建模多轮对话，考虑对话中双方的私有信息和条件生成。

Result: 在指代游戏和医疗领域医患对话实验中，CRSA表现出比现有基线更一致、可解释和协作的行为。

Conclusion: CRSA为更实用和社交意识强的语言代理提供了新途径。

Abstract: As AI systems take on collaborative roles, they must reason about shared
goals and beliefs-not just generate fluent language. The Rational Speech Act
(RSA) framework offers a principled approach to pragmatic reasoning, but
existing extensions face challenges in scaling to multi-turn, collaborative
scenarios. In this paper, we introduce Collaborative Rational Speech Act
(CRSA), an information-theoretic (IT) extension of RSA that models multi-turn
dialog by optimizing a gain function adapted from rate-distortion theory. This
gain is an extension of the gain model that is maximized in the original RSA
model but takes into account the scenario in which both agents in a
conversation have private information and produce utterances conditioned on the
dialog. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CRSA on referential games and
template-based doctor-patient dialogs in the medical domain. Empirical results
show that CRSA yields more consistent, interpretable, and collaborative
behavior than existing baselines-paving the way for more pragmatic and socially
aware language agents.

TL;DR: DENSE系统通过模拟医生参考历史记录的方式，生成临床连贯且时间敏感的进展记录，填补了电子健康记录中进展记录的缺失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 进展记录在电子健康记录中具有重要意义，但在大规模数据集中严重不足，如MIMIC-III中仅8.56%的就诊包含进展记录。

Method: DENSE结合细粒度分类和时间对齐机制，利用临床检索策略和大语言模型生成连贯的进展记录。

Result: 生成的记录在时间对齐比（1.089）上优于原始记录，支持下游任务如总结和预测建模。

Conclusion: DENSE为实际医疗环境中基于大语言模型的记录合成提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Progress notes are among the most clinically meaningful artifacts in an
Electronic Health Record (EHR), offering temporally grounded insights into a
patient's evolving condition, treatments, and care decisions. Despite their
importance, they are severely underrepresented in large-scale EHR datasets. For
instance, in the widely used Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III
(MIMIC-III) dataset, only about $8.56\%$ of hospital visits include progress
notes, leaving gaps in longitudinal patient narratives. In contrast, the
dataset contains a diverse array of other note types, each capturing different
aspects of care.
  We present DENSE (Documenting Evolving Progress Notes from Scattered
Evidence), a system designed to align with clinical documentation workflows by
simulating how physicians reference past encounters while drafting progress
notes. The system introduces a fine-grained note categorization and a temporal
alignment mechanism that organizes heterogeneous notes across visits into
structured, chronological inputs. At its core, DENSE leverages a clinically
informed retrieval strategy to identify temporally and semantically relevant
content from both current and prior visits. This retrieved evidence is used to
prompt a large language model (LLM) to generate clinically coherent and
temporally aware progress notes.
  We evaluate DENSE on a curated cohort of patients with multiple visits and
complete progress note documentation. The generated notes demonstrate strong
longitudinal fidelity, achieving a temporal alignment ratio of $1.089$,
surpassing the continuity observed in original notes. By restoring narrative
coherence across fragmented documentation, our system supports improved
downstream tasks such as summarization, predictive modeling, and clinical
decision support, offering a scalable solution for LLM-driven note synthesis in
real-world healthcare settings.

TL;DR: PLABA track评估了语言模型将生物医学文献改写为通俗语言的能力，发现模型在事实准确性和完整性上接近人类水平，但在简洁性和自动评估工具上仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学文献的专业性使其对患者和护理人员难以理解，语言模型可能提供解决方案，但需严格评估其可靠性和安全性。

Method: 通过PLABA竞赛任务（全文改写和术语替换），结合专业参考和专家手动评估，对模型性能进行多维度分析。

Result: 模型在事实准确性和完整性上表现优异，但简洁性不足；自动评估工具与人工评估相关性低；术语替换任务中LLM表现较好。

Conclusion: 语言模型在生物医学文献通俗化中具有潜力，但需改进简洁性和自动评估工具。

Abstract: Objective: Recent advances in language models have shown potential to adapt
professional-facing biomedical literature to plain language, making it
accessible to patients and caregivers. However, their unpredictability,
combined with the high potential for harm in this domain, means rigorous
evaluation is necessary. Our goals with this track were to stimulate research
and to provide high-quality evaluation of the most promising systems.
  Methods: We hosted the Plain Language Adaptation of Biomedical Abstracts
(PLABA) track at the 2023 and 2024 Text Retrieval Conferences. Tasks included
complete, sentence-level, rewriting of abstracts (Task 1) as well as
identifying and replacing difficult terms (Task 2). For automatic evaluation of
Task 1, we developed a four-fold set of professionally-written references.
Submissions for both Tasks 1 and 2 were provided extensive manual evaluation
from biomedical experts.
  Results: Twelve teams spanning twelve countries participated in the track,
with models from multilayer perceptrons to large pretrained transformers. In
manual judgments of Task 1, top-performing models rivaled human levels of
factual accuracy and completeness, but not simplicity or brevity. Automatic,
reference-based metrics generally did not correlate well with manual judgments.
In Task 2, systems struggled with identifying difficult terms and classifying
how to replace them. When generating replacements, however, LLM-based systems
did well in manually judged accuracy, completeness, and simplicity, though not
in brevity.
  Conclusion: The PLABA track showed promise for using Large Language Models to
adapt biomedical literature for the general public, while also highlighting
their deficiencies and the need for improved automatic benchmarking tools.

Result: 综述为研究者提供了清晰的路线图和参考，促进了该领域的创新。

Conclusion: 论文展望了OVOD在无人机航拍场景中的未来研究方向和应用前景。

Abstract: Due to its extensive applications, aerial image object detection has long
been a hot topic in computer vision. In recent years, advancements in Unmanned
Aerial Vehicles (UAV) technology have further propelled this field to new
heights, giving rise to a broader range of application requirements. However,
traditional UAV aerial object detection methods primarily focus on detecting
predefined categories, which significantly limits their applicability. The
advent of cross-modal text-image alignment (e.g., CLIP) has overcome this
limitation, enabling open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD), which can
identify previously unseen objects through natural language descriptions. This
breakthrough significantly enhances the intelligence and autonomy of UAVs in
aerial scene understanding. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of OVOD
in the context of UAV aerial scenes. We begin by aligning the core principles
of OVOD with the unique characteristics of UAV vision, setting the stage for a
specialized discussion. Building on this foundation, we construct a systematic
taxonomy that categorizes existing OVOD methods for aerial imagery and provides
a comprehensive overview of the relevant datasets. This structured review
enables us to critically dissect the key challenges and open problems at the
intersection of these fields. Finally, based on this analysis, we outline
promising future research directions and application prospects. This survey
aims to provide a clear road map and a valuable reference for both newcomers
and seasoned researchers, fostering innovation in this rapidly evolving domain.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为EDNIG的新型深度学习框架，用于低光图像增强。EDNIG基于U-Net架构，结合亮度图和多尺度特征提取模块，通过GAN框架优化，在性能和模型复杂度上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低光图像增强在现实应用中具有重要意义，但现有方法在复杂光照条件下的表现仍有提升空间。

Method: EDNIG基于U-Net架构，引入亮度图和多尺度特征提取模块，使用Swish激活函数和复合损失函数进行优化。

Result: 实验表明，EDNIG在定量指标和视觉质量上优于现有方法，同时模型复杂度较低。

Conclusion: EDNIG是一种高效的低光图像增强方法，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework for low-light image
enhancement, named the Encoder-Decoder Network with Illumination Guidance
(EDNIG). Building upon the U-Net architecture, EDNIG integrates an illumination
map, derived from Bright Channel Prior (BCP), as a guidance input. This
illumination guidance helps the network focus on underexposed regions,
effectively steering the enhancement process. To further improve the model's
representational power, a Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) module is incorporated
to extract multi-scale contextual features, enabling better handling of diverse
lighting conditions. Additionally, the Swish activation function is employed to
ensure smoother gradient propagation during training. EDNIG is optimized within
a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework using a composite loss
function that combines adversarial loss, pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE),

### [47] [VLMs have Tunnel Vision: Evaluating Nonlocal Visual Reasoning in Leading VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13361)
*Shmuel Berman,Jia Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs在复杂视觉任务中表现出色，但在简单感知测试中表现不佳。研究发现，现有模型在非局部视觉推理任务（如比较感知、扫视搜索和平滑视觉搜索）中表现差，甚至接近随机准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估视觉语言模型在非局部视觉推理任务中的能力，揭示其在核心视觉推理能力上的不足。

Method: 设计三种非局部视觉任务（比较感知、扫视搜索、平滑视觉搜索），测试主流模型（如Gemini 2.5 Pro、Claude Vision 3.7、GPT-o4-mini）的表现。

Result: 旗舰模型在这些任务中表现不佳，准确率接近随机水平，远低于人类表现。

Conclusion: 尽管视觉敏锐度有所提升，当前模型仍缺乏核心视觉推理能力。

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) excel at complex visual tasks such as VQA and
chart understanding, yet recent work suggests they struggle with simple
perceptual tests. We present an evaluation that tests vision-language models'
capacity for nonlocal visual reasoning -- reasoning that requires chaining
evidence collected from multiple, possibly distant, regions of an image. We
isolate three distinct forms of non-local vision: comparative perception, which
demands holding two images in working memory and comparing them; saccadic
search, which requires making discrete, evidence-driven jumps to locate
successive targets; and smooth visual search, which involves searching smoothly
along a continuous contour. Flagship models (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude
Vision 3.7, GPT-o4-mini), even those that perform well on prior
primitive-vision benchmarks, fail these tests and barely exceed random accuracy
on two variants of our tasks that are trivial for humans. Our structured
evaluation suite allows us to test if VLMs can perform similar visual
algorithms to humans. Our findings show that despite gains in raw visual
acuity, current models lack core visual reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了视觉语言模型（VLMs）的空间推理能力，通过Chain-of-Thought（CoT）提示和强化学习改进。发现结构化多阶段提示（SceneGraph CoT）显著提升性能，而GRPO强化学习方法优于监督微调（SFT），尤其在泛化性上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过提示策略和强化学习提升VLMs的空间推理能力，并解决SFT在泛化性上的不足。

Method: 使用SceneGraph CoT提示策略和GRPO强化学习方法，在SAT数据集上微调模型，并在CVBench上评估性能。

Result: SceneGraph CoT显著提升空间推理准确性；GRPO在Pass@1评估和OOD条件下优于SFT，泛化性更强。

Conclusion: 结构化提示和强化学习可有效提升VLMs的空间推理能力和泛化性，GRPO方法尤其适用于动态语言环境。

Abstract: This study investigates the spatial reasoning capabilities of vision-language
models (VLMs) through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and reinforcement
learning. We begin by evaluating the impact of different prompting strategies
and find that simple CoT formats, where the model generates a reasoning step
before the answer, not only fail to help, but can even harm the model's
original performance. In contrast, structured multi-stage prompting based on
scene graphs (SceneGraph CoT) significantly improves spatial reasoning
accuracy. Furthermore, to improve spatial reasoning ability, we fine-tune
models using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on the SAT dataset and
evaluate their performance on CVBench. Compared to supervised fine-tuning
(SFT), GRPO achieves higher accuracy on Pass@1 evaluations and demonstrates
superior robustness under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions. In particular,
we find that SFT overfits to surface-level linguistic patterns and may degrade
performance when test-time phrasing changes (e.g., from "closer to" to "farther
from"). GRPO, on the other hand, generalizes more reliably and maintains stable
performance under such shifts. Our findings provide insights into how
reinforcement learning and structured prompting improve the spatial reasoning
capabilities and generalization behavior of modern VLMs. All code is open

Conclusion: 展示了2D基础模型在可扩展3D感知中的潜力，开源代码和资源。

Abstract: Modern 3D object detection datasets are constrained by narrow class
taxonomies and costly manual annotations, limiting their ability to scale to
open-world settings. In contrast, 2D vision-language models trained on
web-scale image-text pairs exhibit rich semantic understanding and support
open-vocabulary detection via natural language prompts. In this work, we
leverage the maturity and category diversity of 2D foundation models to perform
open-vocabulary 3D object detection without any human-annotated 3D labels.
  Our pipeline uses a 2D vision-language detector to generate text-conditioned
proposals, which are segmented with SAM and back-projected into 3D using camera
geometry and either LiDAR or monocular pseudo-depth. We introduce a geometric
inflation strategy based on DBSCAN clustering and Rotating Calipers to infer 3D
bounding boxes without training. To simulate adverse real-world conditions, we
construct Pseudo-nuScenes, a fog-augmented, RGB-only variant of the nuScenes
dataset.
  Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive localization
performance across multiple settings, including LiDAR-based and purely RGB-D
inputs, all while remaining training-free and open-vocabulary. Our results
highlight the untapped potential of 2D foundation models for scalable 3D
perception. We open-source our code and resources at

Conclusion: 所提出的架构、预训练策略和多任务训练方法在多模态任务中表现出色。

Abstract: We present a novel multimodal multitask network and associated training
algorithm. The method is capable of ingesting data from approximately 12
different modalities namely image, video, audio, text, depth, point cloud, time
series, tabular, graph, X-ray, infrared, IMU, and hyperspectral. The proposed
approach utilizes modality specialized tokenizers, a shared transformer
architecture, and cross-attention mechanisms to project the data from different
modalities into a unified embedding space. It addresses multimodal and
multitask scenarios by incorporating modality-specific task heads for different
tasks in respective modalities. We propose a novel pretraining strategy with
iterative modality switching to initialize the network, and a training
algorithm which trades off fully joint training over all modalities, with
training on pairs of modalities at a time. We provide comprehensive evaluation
across 25 datasets from 12 modalities and show state of the art performances,
demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed architecture, pretraining
strategy and adapted multitask training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有架构（如YOLO和DETR）在多尺度特征一致性和计算效率之间难以平衡，影响了自动驾驶中目标检测的鲁棒性。

Method: Butter引入了FAFCE组件（频率自适应特征一致性增强）和PHFFNet模块（渐进式层次特征融合网络），分别优化多尺度特征一致性和层次特征学习。

Result: 在BDD100K、KITTI和Cityscapes数据集上的实验表明，Butter在检测精度和计算效率上均有显著提升。

Conclusion: Butter通过层次特征优化，实现了精度、可部署性和计算效率的平衡，适用于实时自动驾驶场景。

Abstract: Hierarchical feature representations play a pivotal role in computer vision,
particularly in object detection for autonomous driving. Multi-level semantic
understanding is crucial for accurately identifying pedestrians, vehicles, and
traffic signs in dynamic environments. However, existing architectures, such as
YOLO and DETR, struggle to maintain feature consistency across different scales
while balancing detection precision and computational efficiency. To address
these challenges, we propose Butter, a novel object detection framework
designed to enhance hierarchical feature representations for improving
detection robustness. Specifically, Butter introduces two key innovations:
Frequency-Adaptive Feature Consistency Enhancement (FAFCE) Component, which
refines multi-scale feature consistency by leveraging adaptive frequency
filtering to enhance structural and boundary precision, and Progressive
Hierarchical Feature Fusion Network (PHFFNet) Module, which progressively
integrates multi-level features to mitigate semantic gaps and strengthen
hierarchical feature learning. Through extensive experiments on BDD100K, KITTI,
and Cityscapes, Butter demonstrates superior feature representation
capabilities, leading to notable improvements in detection accuracy while
reducing model complexity. By focusing on hierarchical feature refinement and
integration, Butter provides an advanced approach to object detection that
achieves a balance between accuracy, deployability, and computational
efficiency in real-time autonomous driving scenarios. Our model and
implementation are publicly available at https://github.com/Aveiro-Lin/Butter,

Method: 利用GPT-4.1分析查询意图，预测信息需求，动态路由查询到ASR、OCR或视觉索引，平均每查询使用1.78种模态（而非全量3.0）。

Result: 在180万视频片段上的评估显示，ModaRoute减少了41%的计算开销，Recall@5为60.9%，显著降低了基础设施成本。

Conclusion: 智能路由为多模态检索系统的规模化提供了实用解决方案，兼顾了成本与效果。

Abstract: We introduce ModaRoute, an LLM-based intelligent routing system that
dynamically selects optimal modalities for multimodal video retrieval. While
dense text captions can achieve 75.9% Recall@5, they require expensive offline
processing and miss critical visual information present in 34% of clips with
scene text not captured by ASR. By analyzing query intent and predicting
information needs, ModaRoute reduces computational overhead by 41% while
achieving 60.9% Recall@5. Our approach uses GPT-4.1 to route queries across ASR
(speech), OCR (text), and visual indices, averaging 1.78 modalities per query
versus exhaustive 3.0 modality search. Evaluation on 1.8M video clips
demonstrates that intelligent routing provides a practical solution for scaling
multimodal retrieval systems, reducing infrastructure costs while maintaining
competitive effectiveness for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Industrial defect detection is vital for upholding product quality across
contemporary manufacturing systems. As the expectations for precision,
automation, and scalability intensify, conventional inspection approaches are
increasingly found wanting in addressing real-world demands. Notable progress
in computer vision and deep learning has substantially bolstered defect
detection capabilities across both 2D and 3D modalities. A significant
development has been the pivot from closed-set to open-set defect detection
frameworks, which diminishes the necessity for extensive defect annotations and
facilitates the recognition of novel anomalies. Despite such strides, a
cohesive and contemporary understanding of industrial defect detection remains
elusive. Consequently, this survey delivers an in-depth analysis of both
closed-set and open-set defect detection strategies within 2D and 3D
modalities, charting their evolution in recent years and underscoring the
rising prominence of open-set techniques. We distill critical challenges
inherent in practical detection environments and illuminate emerging trends,
thereby providing a current and comprehensive vista of this swiftly progressing
field.

Conclusion: 多模态输入对SatML模型的数据效率和泛化能力有重要价值，硬编码融合策略值得未来研究关注。

Abstract: A large variety of geospatial data layers is available around the world
ranging from remotely-sensed raster data like satellite imagery, digital
elevation models, predicted land cover maps, and human-annotated data, to data
derived from environmental sensors such as air temperature or wind speed data.
A large majority of machine learning models trained on satellite imagery
(SatML), however, are designed primarily for optical input modalities such as
multi-spectral satellite imagery. To better understand the value of using other
input modalities alongside optical imagery in supervised learning settings, we
generate augmented versions of SatML benchmark tasks by appending additional
geographic data layers to datasets spanning classification, regression, and
segmentation. Using these augmented datasets, we find that fusing additional
geographic inputs with optical imagery can significantly improve SatML model
performance. Benefits are largest in settings where labeled data are limited
and in geographic out-of-sample settings, suggesting that multi-modal inputs
may be especially valuable for data-efficiency and out-of-sample performance of
SatML models. Surprisingly, we find that hard-coded fusion strategies
outperform learned variants, with interesting implications for future work.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in producing high-quality images, but their reliance on
large-scale unlabeled data has raised significant safety and copyright
concerns. Efforts to address these issues by erasing unwanted concepts have
shown promise. However, many existing erasure methods involve excessive
modifications that compromise the overall utility of the model. In this work,
we address these issues by formulating a novel minimalist concept erasure
objective based \emph{only} on the distributional distance of final generation
outputs. Building on our formulation, we derive a tractable loss for
differentiable optimization that leverages backpropagation through all
generation steps in an end-to-end manner. We also conduct extensive analysis to
show theoretical connections with other models and methods. To improve the
robustness of the erasure, we incorporate neuron masking as an alternative to
model fine-tuning. Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art flow-matching
models demonstrate that our method robustly erases concepts without degrading
overall model performance, paving the way for safer and more responsible
generative models.

Abstract: Accurate perception of the surrounding environment is essential for safe
autonomous driving. 3D occupancy prediction, which estimates detailed 3D
structures of roads, buildings, and other objects, is particularly important
for vision-centric autonomous driving systems that do not rely on LiDAR
sensors. However, in 3D semantic occupancy prediction -- where each voxel is
assigned a semantic label -- annotated LiDAR point clouds are required, making
data acquisition costly. In contrast, large-scale binary occupancy data, which
only indicate occupied or free space without semantic labels, can be collected
at a lower cost. Despite their availability, the potential of leveraging such
data remains unexplored. In this study, we investigate the utilization of
large-scale binary occupancy data from two perspectives: (1) pre-training and
(2) learning-based auto-labeling. We propose a novel binary occupancy-based
framework that decomposes the prediction process into binary and semantic
occupancy modules, enabling effective use of binary occupancy data. Our
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms
existing methods in both pre-training and auto-labeling tasks, highlighting its
effectiveness in enhancing 3D semantic occupancy prediction. The code is

Method: 提出InSyn模型，基于Transformer显式捕捉多样化交互模式，并引入SSOS训练策略以缓解初始步预测误差。

Result: 在ETH和UCY数据集上表现优于基线模型，尤其在高密度场景中，SSOS策略将初始步预测误差降低约6.58%。

Conclusion: InSyn模型和SSOS策略有效提升了行人轨迹预测的准确性，尤其在复杂交互场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for intelligent
applications, yet it remains highly challenging due to the complexity of
interactions among pedestrians. Previous methods have primarily relied on
relative positions to model pedestrian interactions; however, they tend to
overlook specific interaction patterns such as paired walking or conflicting
behaviors, limiting the prediction accuracy in crowded scenarios. To address
this issue, we propose InSyn (Interaction-Synchronization Network), a novel
Transformer-based model that explicitly captures diverse interaction patterns
(e.g., walking in sync or conflicting) while effectively modeling
direction-sensitive social behaviors. Additionally, we introduce a training
strategy termed Seq-Start of Seq (SSOS), designed to alleviate the common issue
of initial-step divergence in numerical time-series prediction. Experiments on
the ETH and UCY datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms recent
baselines significantly, especially in high-density scenarios. Furthermore, the
SSOS strategy proves effective in improving sequential prediction performance,
reducing the initial-step prediction error by approximately 6.58%.

Conclusion: MADI为扩散模型在通用、上下文生成架构中的集成铺平了道路。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of diffusion models in text-to-image
generation, their effectiveness in grounded visual editing and compositional
control remains challenging. Motivated by advances in self-supervised learning
and in-context generative modeling, we propose a series of simple yet powerful
design choices that significantly enhance diffusion model capacity for
structured, controllable generation and editing. We introduce Masking-Augmented
Diffusion with Inference-Time Scaling (MADI), a framework that improves the
editability, compositionality and controllability of diffusion models through
two core innovations. First, we introduce Masking-Augmented gaussian Diffusion
(MAgD), a novel training strategy with dual corruption process which combines
standard denoising score matching and masked reconstruction by masking noisy
input from forward process. MAgD encourages the model to learn discriminative
and compositional visual representations, thus enabling localized and
structure-aware editing. Second, we introduce an inference-time capacity
scaling mechanism based on Pause Tokens, which act as special placeholders
inserted into the prompt for increasing computational capacity at inference
time. Our findings show that adopting expressive and dense prompts during
training further enhances performance, particularly for MAgD. Together, these
contributions in MADI substantially enhance the editability of diffusion
models, paving the way toward their integration into more general-purpose,
in-context generative diffusion architectures.

Abstract: In this study, we present a comprehensive public dataset for driver
drowsiness detection, integrating multimodal signals of facial, behavioral, and
biometric indicators. Our dataset includes 3D facial video using a depth
camera, IR camera footage, posterior videos, and biometric signals such as
heart rate, electrodermal activity, blood oxygen saturation, skin temperature,
and accelerometer data. This data set provides grip sensor data from the
steering wheel and telemetry data from the American truck simulator game to
provide more information about drivers' behavior while they are alert and
drowsy. Drowsiness levels were self-reported every four minutes using the
Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). The simulation environment consists of three
monitor setups, and the driving condition is completely like a car. Data were
collected from 19 subjects (15 M, 4 F) in two conditions: when they were fully
alert and when they exhibited signs of sleepiness. Unlike other datasets, our
multimodal dataset has a continuous duration of 40 minutes for each data
collection session per subject, contributing to a total length of 1,400
minutes, and we recorded gradual changes in the driver state rather than
discrete alert/drowsy labels. This study aims to create a comprehensive
multimodal dataset of driver drowsiness that captures a wider range of
physiological, behavioral, and driving-related signals. The dataset will be
available upon request to the corresponding author.

Method: AortaDiff使用体积引导的条件扩散模型生成主动脉中心线，并自动提取血管轮廓，最终拟合为平滑的3D表面。

Result: 实验表明，AortaDiff在有限训练数据下有效构建正常和病理主动脉网格，几何保真度高。

Conclusion: AortaDiff为心血管研究提供了一种端到端、低依赖的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate 3D aortic construction is crucial for clinical diagnosis,
preoperative planning, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, as
it enables the estimation of critical hemodynamic parameters such as blood flow
velocity, pressure distribution, and wall shear stress. Existing construction
methods often rely on large annotated training datasets and extensive manual
intervention. While the resulting meshes can serve for visualization purposes,
they struggle to produce geometrically consistent, well-constructed surfaces
suitable for downstream CFD analysis. To address these challenges, we introduce
AortaDiff, a diffusion-based framework that generates smooth aortic surfaces
directly from CT/MRI volumes. AortaDiff first employs a volume-guided
conditional diffusion model (CDM) to iteratively generate aortic centerlines
conditioned on volumetric medical images. Each centerline point is then
automatically used as a prompt to extract the corresponding vessel contour,
ensuring accurate boundary delineation. Finally, the extracted contours are
fitted into a smooth 3D surface, yielding a continuous, CFD-compatible mesh
representation. AortaDiff offers distinct advantages over existing methods,
including an end-to-end workflow, minimal dependency on large labeled datasets,
and the ability to generate CFD-compatible aorta meshes with high geometric
fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that AortaDiff performs effectively
even with limited training data, successfully constructing both normal and
pathologically altered aorta meshes, including cases with aneurysms or
coarctation. This capability enables the generation of high-quality
visualizations and positions AortaDiff as a practical solution for
cardiovascular research.

TL;DR: COREVQA是一个新的视觉语言模型（VLM）基准测试，专注于视觉蕴含任务，揭示了现有模型在拥挤场景中的推理能力不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM基准测试主要关注视觉问答（VQA），但缺乏对视觉蕴含能力的评估，尤其是在拥挤场景中。

Method: 提出COREVQA基准测试，包含5608张图像和合成的真假陈述对，图像来自CrowdHuman数据集。

Result: 即使表现最好的VLM准确率也低于80%，其他模型表现更差（39.98%-69.95%）。

Conclusion: COREVQA揭示了VLM在拥挤场景中视觉蕴含推理能力的显著局限性。

Abstract: Recently, many benchmarks and datasets have been developed to evaluate
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) using visual question answering (VQA) pairs, and
models have shown significant accuracy improvements. However, these benchmarks
rarely test the model's ability to accurately complete visual entailment, for
instance, accepting or refuting a hypothesis based on the image. To address
this, we propose COREVQA (Crowd Observations and Reasoning Entailment), a
benchmark of 5608 image and synthetically generated true/false statement pairs,
with images derived from the CrowdHuman dataset, to provoke visual entailment
reasoning on challenging crowded images. Our results show that even the
top-performing VLMs achieve accuracy below 80%, with other models performing
substantially worse (39.98%-69.95%). This significant performance gap reveals
key limitations in VLMs' ability to reason over certain types of image-question
pairs in crowded scenes.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为IConMark的新型语义水印方法，用于区分AI生成图像与真实图像，具有抗对抗攻击和人类可读的特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI和合成媒体的快速发展，区分AI生成图像与真实图像对防止虚假信息和确保数字真实性至关重要。传统水印技术易受对抗攻击，效果不佳。

Method: IConMark通过在AI生成图像中嵌入可解释的语义属性，而非传统的噪声或扰动，实现人类可读和抗对抗攻击的水印。还提出了结合现有水印技术的混合方法（IConMark+SS和IConMark+TM）。

Result: IConMark及其变体在水印检测的AUROC得分上分别比最佳基线高出10.8%、14.5%和15.9%，且在图像质量保持和抗图像增强方面表现优异。

Conclusion: IConMark是一种高效、可解释且抗对抗攻击的水印方法，为数字真实性保护提供了新方向。

Abstract: With the rapid rise of generative AI and synthetic media, distinguishing
AI-generated images from real ones has become crucial in safeguarding against
misinformation and ensuring digital authenticity. Traditional watermarking
techniques have shown vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks, undermining their
effectiveness in the presence of attackers. We propose IConMark, a novel
in-generation robust semantic watermarking method that embeds interpretable
concepts into AI-generated images, as a first step toward interpretable
watermarking. Unlike traditional methods, which rely on adding noise or
perturbations to AI-generated images, IConMark incorporates meaningful semantic
attributes, making it interpretable to humans and hence, resilient to
adversarial manipulation. This method is not only robust against various image
augmentations but also human-readable, enabling manual verification of
watermarks. We demonstrate a detailed evaluation of IConMark's effectiveness,
demonstrating its superiority in terms of detection accuracy and maintaining
image quality. Moreover, IConMark can be combined with existing watermarking
techniques to further enhance and complement its robustness. We introduce
IConMark+SS and IConMark+TM, hybrid approaches combining IConMark with
StegaStamp and TrustMark, respectively, to further bolster robustness against
multiple types of image manipulations. Our base watermarking technique
(IConMark) and its variants (+TM and +SS) achieve 10.8%, 14.5%, and 15.9%
higher mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC)
scores for watermark detection, respectively, compared to the best baseline on
various datasets.

TL;DR: AI多模型深度学习系统在肩部X光片中高效检测骨折，准确率达95.5%，适用于临床快速筛查。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决肩部骨折在急诊和高负荷临床环境中漏诊率高的问题，利用AI技术提升早期检测能力。

Method: 采用多模型深度学习系统（Faster R-CNN、EfficientDet、RF-DETR），结合边界框和分类级集成技术（如Soft-NMS、WBF、NMW融合）。

Result: NMW集成方法在准确率（95.5%）和F1分数（0.9610）上优于单一模型，具有高召回率和定位精度。

Conclusion: 集成AI模型能可靠检测肩部骨折，适合实时诊断流程，但仅限于二元骨折检测，适用于快速筛查而非详细分类。

Abstract: Background: Shoulder fractures are often underdiagnosed, especially in
emergency and high-volume clinical settings. Studies report up to 10% of such
fractures may be missed by radiologists. AI-driven tools offer a scalable way
to assist early detection and reduce diagnostic delays. We address this gap
through a dedicated AI system for shoulder radiographs. Methods: We developed a
multi-model deep learning system using 10,000 annotated shoulder X-rays.
Architectures include Faster R-CNN (ResNet50-FPN, ResNeXt), EfficientDet, and
RF-DETR. To enhance detection, we applied bounding box and classification-level
ensemble techniques such as Soft-NMS, WBF, and NMW fusion. Results: The NMW
ensemble achieved 95.5% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.9610, outperforming
individual models across all key metrics. It demonstrated strong recall and
localization precision, confirming its effectiveness for clinical fracture
detection in shoulder X-rays. Conclusion: The results show ensemble-based AI
can reliably detect shoulder fractures in radiographs with high clinical
relevance. The model's accuracy and deployment readiness position it well for
integration into real-time diagnostic workflows. The current model is limited
to binary fracture detection, reflecting its design for rapid screening and
triage support rather than detailed orthopedic classification.

Motivation: 利用CORONA影像提升AI模型在考古遗址识别中的表现，尤其是在环境已发生巨大变化的区域。

Method: 基于Bing的卷积网络模型，使用CORONA影像对阿布格莱布地区进行重新训练。

Result: 检测精度显著提升（IoU超过85%，总体准确率90%），并发现4个新考古遗址。

Conclusion: AI结合CORONA影像在考古遗址发现中具有突破性意义，尤其适用于因人为破坏而消失的遗址。

Abstract: By upgrading an existing deep learning model with the knowledge provided by
one of the oldest sets of grayscale satellite imagery, known as CORONA, we
improved the AI model attitude towards the automatic identification of
archaeological sites in an environment which has been completely transformed in
the last five decades, including the complete destruction of many of those same
sites. The initial Bing based convolutional network model was retrained using
CORONA satellite imagery for the district of Abu Ghraib, west of Baghdad,
central Mesopotamian floodplain. The results were twofold and surprising.
First, the detection precision obtained on the area of interest increased
sensibly: in particular, the Intersection over Union (IoU) values, at the image
segmentation level, surpassed 85 percent, while the general accuracy in
detecting archeological sites reached 90 percent. Second, our retrained model
allowed the identification of four new sites of archaeological interest
(confirmed through field verification), previously not identified by
archaeologists with traditional techniques. This has confirmed the efficacy of
using AI techniques and the CORONA imagery from the 1960 to discover
archaeological sites currently no longer visible, a concrete breakthrough with
significant consequences for the study of landscapes with vanishing
archaeological evidence induced by anthropization

Motivation: 提高人机共驾系统的安全性和交互效率，解决现有方法在建模复杂时空依赖性和人类驾驶行为不可预测性方面的不足。

Method: 提出CaSTFormer，包含Reciprocal Shift Fusion（RSF）机制、Causal Pattern Extraction（CPE）模块和Feature Synthesis Network（FSN），分别用于特征对齐、消除虚假相关性和特征合成。

Result: 在Brain4Cars数据集上达到最先进性能，有效捕捉复杂因果时空依赖关系，提升预测准确性和透明度。

Conclusion: CaSTFormer通过显式建模驾驶行为与环境背景的因果交互，为驾驶意图预测提供了更准确和透明的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of driving intention is key to enhancing the safety and
interactive efficiency of human-machine co-driving systems. It serves as a
cornerstone for achieving high-level autonomous driving. However, current
approaches remain inadequate for accurately modeling the complex
spatio-temporal interdependencies and the unpredictable variability of human
driving behavior. To address these challenges, we propose CaSTFormer, a Causal
Spatio-Temporal Transformer to explicitly model causal interactions between
driver behavior and environmental context for robust intention prediction.
Specifically, CaSTFormer introduces a novel Reciprocal Shift Fusion (RSF)
mechanism for precise temporal alignment of internal and external feature
streams, a Causal Pattern Extraction (CPE) module that systematically
eliminates spurious correlations to reveal authentic causal dependencies, and
an innovative Feature Synthesis Network (FSN) that adaptively synthesizes these
purified representations into coherent spatio-temporal inferences. We evaluate
the proposed CaSTFormer on the public Brain4Cars dataset, and it achieves
state-of-the-art performance. It effectively captures complex causal
spatio-temporal dependencies and enhances both the accuracy and transparency of
driving intention prediction.

Abstract: Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress in creating
high-quality, photorealistic content. However, their ability to accurately
simulate physical phenomena remains a critical and unresolved challenge. This
paper presents PhyWorldBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
video generation models based on their adherence to the laws of physics. The
benchmark covers multiple levels of physical phenomena, ranging from
fundamental principles like object motion and energy conservation to more
complex scenarios involving rigid body interactions and human or animal motion.
Additionally, we introduce a novel ""Anti-Physics"" category, where prompts
intentionally violate real-world physics, enabling the assessment of whether
models can follow such instructions while maintaining logical consistency.
Besides large-scale human evaluation, we also design a simple yet effective
method that could utilize current MLLM to evaluate the physics realism in a
zero-shot fashion. We evaluate 12 state-of-the-art text-to-video generation
models, including five open-source and five proprietary models, with a detailed
comparison and analysis. we identify pivotal challenges models face in adhering
to real-world physics. Through systematic testing of their outputs across 1,050
curated prompts-spanning fundamental, composite, and anti-physics scenarios-we
identify pivotal challenges these models face in adhering to real-world
physics. We then rigorously examine their performance on diverse physical
phenomena with varying prompt types, deriving targeted recommendations for
crafting prompts that enhance fidelity to physical principles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 摄影测量点云的精度高度依赖场景，且MVS阶段的不确定性估计尚未标准化，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了一种自校准方法，利用MVS阶段的多视图点和相关线索回归视差不确定性。

Result: 在多种公开数据集上验证，结果显示该方法优于现有方法，实现了高边界率且未高估不确定性。

Conclusion: 该方法为摄影测量过程提供了鲁棒且可验证的不确定性量化，适用于多样化场景。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification of the photogrammetry process is essential for
providing per-point accuracy credentials of the point clouds. Unlike airborne
LiDAR, which typically delivers consistent accuracy across various scenes, the
accuracy of photogrammetric point clouds is highly scene-dependent, since it
relies on algorithm-generated measurements (i.e., stereo or multi-view stereo).
Generally, errors of the photogrammetric point clouds propagate through a
two-step process: Structure-from-Motion (SfM) with Bundle adjustment (BA),
followed by Multi-view Stereo (MVS). While uncertainty estimation in the SfM
stage has been well studied using the first-order statistics of the
reprojection error function, that in the MVS stage remains largely unsolved and
non-standardized, primarily due to its non-differentiable and multi-modal
nature (i.e., from pixel values to geometry). In this paper, we present an
uncertainty quantification framework closing this gap by associating an error
covariance matrix per point accounting for this two-step photogrammetry
process. Specifically, to estimate the uncertainty in the MVS stage, we propose
a novel, self-calibrating method by taking reliable n-view points (n>=6)
per-view to regress the disparity uncertainty using highly relevant cues (such
as matching cost values) from the MVS stage. Compared to existing approaches,
our method uses self-contained, reliable 3D points extracted directly from the
MVS process, with the benefit of being self-supervised and naturally adhering
to error propagation path of the photogrammetry process, thereby providing a
robust and certifiable uncertainty quantification across diverse scenes. We
evaluate the framework using a variety of publicly available airborne and UAV
imagery datasets. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches by achieving high bounding rates without overestimating uncertainty.

features from Sentinel-2 image sequences, combined with
acquisition-date-specific temporal encodings to better capture the growth
dynamics of sugar-beets. The learned representations are used in a downstream
clustering task to separate stressed from healthy fields. The resulting stress
detection system can be directly applied to data from different years, offering
a practical and accessible tool for stress detection in sugar-beets.

Conclusion: 该技术为AI辅助2D材料表征从实验室研究到工业应用的转化提供了重要进展。

Abstract: The increasing use of two-dimensional (2D) materials in nanoelectronics
demands robust metrology techniques for electrical characterization, especially
for large-scale production. While atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques like
conductive AFM (C-AFM) offer high accuracy, they suffer from slow data
acquisition speeds due to the raster scanning process. To address this, we
introduce SparseC-AFM, a deep learning model that rapidly and accurately
reconstructs conductivity maps of 2D materials like MoS$_2$ from sparse C-AFM
scans. Our approach is robust across various scanning modes, substrates, and
experimental conditions. We report a comparison between (a) classic flow
implementation, where a high pixel density C-AFM image (e.g., 15 minutes to
collect) is manually parsed to extract relevant material parameters, and (b)
our SparseC-AFM method, which achieves the same operation using data that
requires substantially less acquisition time (e.g., under 5 minutes).
SparseC-AFM enables efficient extraction of critical material parameters in
MoS$_2$, including film coverage, defect density, and identification of
crystalline island boundaries, edges, and cracks. We achieve over 11x reduction
in acquisition time compared to manual extraction from a full-resolution C-AFM
image. Moreover, we demonstrate that our model-predicted samples exhibit
remarkably similar electrical properties to full-resolution data gathered using
classic-flow scanning. This work represents a significant step toward
translating AI-assisted 2D material characterization from laboratory research
to industrial fabrication. Code and model weights are available at

constructed in this work. The new regularizer is compared to existing methods

Abstract: Recent progress in transformer-based architectures has demonstrated

By leveraging block-wise attention with adaptive sparsity-driven threshold,
NABLA reduces computational overhead while preserving generative quality. Our

integrated with PyTorch's Flex Attention operator. Experiments demonstrate that
NABLA achieves up to 2.7x faster training and inference compared to baseline
almost without compromising quantitative metrics (CLIP score, VBench score,

Motivation: 现实应用中的领域特定细节和细粒度语义难以通过生成器捕捉，导致合成重放方法生成不准确的样本，影响微调和知识保留。

Result: 在MTIL基准测试中表现优于现有合成重放技术，平衡了可塑性、稳定性和零样本能力。

Conclusion: LoRA适配生成器的方法有效提升了视觉语言模型在持续学习中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Continual learning for vision-language models has achieved remarkable
performance through synthetic replay, where samples are generated using Stable
Diffusion to regularize during finetuning and retain knowledge. However,
real-world downstream applications often exhibit domain-specific nuances and
fine-grained semantics not captured by generators, causing synthetic-replay
methods to produce misaligned samples that misguide finetuning and undermine
retention of prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a LoRA-enhanced
synthetic-replay framework that injects task-specific low-rank adapters into a
frozen Stable Diffusion model, efficiently capturing each new task's unique
visual and semantic patterns. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage,
confidence-based sample selection: we first rank real task data by
post-finetuning VLM confidence to focus LoRA finetuning on the most
representative examples, then generate synthetic samples and again select them
by confidence for distillation. Our approach integrates seamlessly with
existing replay pipelines-simply swap in the adapted generator to boost replay
fidelity. Extensive experiments on the Multi-domain Task Incremental Learning
(MTIL) benchmark show that our method outperforms previous synthetic-replay
techniques, achieving an optimal balance among plasticity, stability, and
zero-shot capability. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of generator
adaptation via LoRA for robust continual learning in VLMs.

Conclusion: NoiseSDF2NoiseSDF方法有效解决了噪声点云下的表面重建问题，为3D神经场去噪提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reconstructing accurate implicit surface representations from point clouds
remains a challenging task, particularly when data is captured using
low-quality scanning devices. These point clouds often contain substantial
noise, leading to inaccurate surface reconstructions. Inspired by the
Noise2Noise paradigm for 2D images, we introduce NoiseSDF2NoiseSDF, a novel
method designed to extend this concept to 3D neural fields. Our approach
enables learning clean neural SDFs directly from noisy point clouds through
noisy supervision by minimizing the MSE loss between noisy SDF representations,
allowing the network to implicitly denoise and refine surface estimations. We
evaluate the effectiveness of NoiseSDF2NoiseSDF on benchmarks, including the
ShapeNet, ABC, Famous, and Real datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
our framework significantly improves surface reconstruction quality from noisy
inputs.

Conclusion: 该方法为无监督去模糊提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Since acquiring large amounts of realistic blurry-sharp image pairs is
difficult and expensive, learning blind image deblurring from unpaired data is
a more practical and promising solution. Unfortunately, dominant approaches
rely heavily on adversarial learning to bridge the gap from blurry domains to
sharp domains, ignoring the complex and unpredictable nature of real-world blur
patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model (DM)-based
framework, dubbed \ours, for image deblurring by learning spatially varying
texture prior from unpaired data. In particular, \ours performs DM to generate
the prior knowledge that aids in recovering the textures of blurry images. To
implement this, we propose a Texture Prior Encoder (TPE) that introduces a
memory mechanism to represent the image textures and provides supervision for
DM training. To fully exploit the generated texture priors, we present the
Texture Transfer Transformer layer (TTformer), in which a novel
Filter-Modulated Multi-head Self-Attention (FM-MSA) efficiently removes
spatially varying blurring through adaptive filtering. Furthermore, we
implement a wavelet-based adversarial loss to preserve high-frequency texture
details. Extensive evaluations show that \ours provides a promising
unsupervised deblurring solution and outperforms SOTA methods in widely-used
benchmarks.

*Kento Kawai,Takeru Oba,Kyotaro Tokoro,Kazutoshi Akita,Norimichi Ukita*

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于扩散模型的随机采样方法，用于从低分辨率（LR）图像中生成高保真超分辨率（SR）图像，显著减少了运行时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有确定性方法生成的SR图像模糊且感知质量差，因此需要一种能生成清晰、高保真SR图像的方法。

Method: 使用扩散模型结合随机采样器（高阶ODE）和一步扩散（知识蒸馏）来提高效率。

Result: 实验表明，该方法将运行时间降至基线的1.6%，同时保持基于图像失真和感知质量的SR质量。

Conclusion: 该方法在高效生成高质量SR图像方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: While burst Low-Resolution (LR) images are useful for improving their Super
Resolution (SR) image compared to a single LR image, prior burst SR methods are
trained in a deterministic manner, which produces a blurry SR image. Since such
blurry images are perceptually degraded, we aim to reconstruct sharp and
high-fidelity SR images by a diffusion model. Our method improves the
efficiency of the diffusion model with a stochastic sampler with a high-order
ODE as well as one-step diffusion using knowledge distillation. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the runtime to 1.6
% of its baseline while maintaining the SR quality measured based on image
distortion and perceptual quality.

TL;DR: CoTasks提出了一种基于链式思维的视频指令调优任务框架，通过分解复杂视频问题为四个实体级基础任务，显著提升了视频大语言模型的推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型缺乏细粒度对象级视频理解的链式思维推理能力，需要结构化标注支持逐步推理。

Method: CoTasks将复杂视频问题分解为帧定位、实体跟踪、时空关系提取四个基础任务，并将中间推理步骤嵌入输入。

Result: 在NeXT-QA基准测试中，LLaVA-video-7B和Qwen2.5-VL-3B的性能分别提升了3.3和17.4分，尤其在因果、时序和描述性子类别中表现突出。

Conclusion: CoTasks作为一种结构化链式思维监督框架，有效提升了视频组合推理能力。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in video large language models (VideoLLMs), a key
open challenge remains: how to equip models with chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning abilities grounded in fine-grained object-level video understanding.
Existing instruction-tuned models, such as the Qwen and LLaVA series, are
trained on high-level video-text pairs, often lacking structured annotations
necessary for compositional, step-by-step reasoning. We propose CoTasks:
Chain-of-Thought based Video Instruction Tuning Tasks, a new framework that
decomposes complex video questions of existing datasets (e.g., NeXT-QA, STAR)
into four entity-level foundational tasks: frame localization, entity tracking,
spatial and temporal relation extraction. By embedding these intermediate
CoT-style reasoning steps into the input, CoTasks enables models to explicitly
perform object-centric spatiotemporal reasoning. Experiments on the NeXT-QA
benchmark show that CoTasks significantly enhance inference performance:
LLaVA-video-7B improves by +3.3 points in average GPT-4 evaluation score, and
Qwen2.5-VL-3B gains +17.4, with large boosts in causal (+14.6), temporal
(+10.9), and descriptive (+48.1) subcategories. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of CoTasks as a structured CoT-style supervision framework for
improving compositional video reasoning.

TL;DR: FoELS方法通过结合光流和纹理信息，有效分离动态和静态物体，适用于复杂场景和相机运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖光流，难以在复杂结构化场景中检测动态物体。

Method: FoELS结合光流计算扩展焦点（FoE），并通过异常值和分割先验估计动态概率。

Result: 在DAVIS 2016数据集和真实交通视频中表现优异，达到先进水平。

Conclusion: FoELS能有效处理复杂场景和相机运动，为3D重建和机器人导航提供支持。

Abstract: Separating moving and static objects from a moving camera viewpoint is
essential for 3D reconstruction, autonomous navigation, and scene understanding
in robotics. Existing approaches often rely primarily on optical flow, which
struggles to detect moving objects in complex, structured scenes involving
camera motion. To address this limitation, we propose Focus of Expansion
Likelihood and Segmentation (FoELS), a method based on the core idea of
integrating both optical flow and texture information. FoELS computes the focus
of expansion (FoE) from optical flow and derives an initial motion likelihood
from the outliers of the FoE computation. This likelihood is then fused with a
segmentation-based prior to estimate the final moving probability. The method
effectively handles challenges including complex structured scenes, rotational
camera motion, and parallel motion. Comprehensive evaluations on the DAVIS 2016
dataset and real-world traffic videos demonstrate its effectiveness and
state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: EPSilon提出了一种高效的点采样策略，通过省略空点来加速混合3D头像生成模型的训练和推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于NeRF和SMPL的混合模型因变形方案计算成本高而推理缓慢，EPSilon旨在通过优化采样策略解决这一问题。

Method: EPSilon引入空射线省略（ERO）和空区间省略（EIO）两种方法，减少无效采样点。

Result: EPSilon仅需3.9%的采样点，推理速度提升约20倍，训练收敛速度提升4倍，同时保持生成质量。

Conclusion: EPSilon通过高效采样策略显著提升了混合3D头像生成模型的性能，为实际应用提供了可行性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of neural radiance fields (NeRF) has paved the way to
generate animatable human avatars from a monocular video. However, the sole
usage of NeRF suffers from a lack of details, which results in the emergence of
hybrid representation that utilizes SMPL-based mesh together with NeRF
representation. While hybrid-based models show photo-realistic human avatar
generation qualities, they suffer from extremely slow inference due to their
deformation scheme: to be aligned with the mesh, hybrid-based models use the
deformation based on SMPL skinning weights, which needs high computational
costs on each sampled point. We observe that since most of the sampled points
are located in empty space, they do not affect the generation quality but
result in inference latency with deformation. In light of this observation, we
propose EPSilon, a hybrid-based 3D avatar generation scheme with novel
efficient point sampling strategies that boost both training and inference. In
EPSilon, we propose two methods to omit empty points at rendering; empty ray
omission (ERO) and empty interval omission (EIO). In ERO, we wipe out rays that
progress through the empty space. Then, EIO narrows down the sampling interval
on the ray, which wipes out the region not occupied by either clothes or mesh.
The delicate sampling scheme of EPSilon enables not only great computational
cost reduction during deformation but also the designation of the important
regions to be sampled, which enables a single-stage NeRF structure without
hierarchical sampling. Compared to existing methods, EPSilon maintains the
generation quality while using only 3.9% of sampled points and achieves around
20 times faster inference, together with 4 times faster training convergence.

Result: 在EvReID和MARS数据集上的实验验证了TriPro-ReID的有效性。

Conclusion: EvReID数据集和TriPro-ReID框架为未来研究提供了数据和基准支持。

Abstract: Recent researchers have proposed using event cameras for person
re-identification (ReID) due to their promising performance and better balance
in terms of privacy protection, event camera-based person ReID has attracted
significant attention. Currently, mainstream event-based person ReID algorithms
primarily focus on fusing visible light and event stream, as well as preserving
privacy. Although significant progress has been made, these methods are
typically trained and evaluated on small-scale or simulated event camera
datasets, making it difficult to assess their real identification performance
and generalization ability. To address the issue of data scarcity, this paper
introduces a large-scale RGB-event based person ReID dataset, called EvReID.
The dataset contains 118,988 image pairs and covers 1200 pedestrian identities,
with data collected across multiple seasons, scenes, and lighting conditions.
We also evaluate 15 state-of-the-art person ReID algorithms, laying a solid
foundation for future research in terms of both data and benchmarking. Based on
our newly constructed dataset, this paper further proposes a pedestrian
attribute-guided contrastive learning framework to enhance feature learning for
person re-identification, termed TriPro-ReID. This framework not only
effectively explores the visual features from both RGB frames and event
streams, but also fully utilizes pedestrian attributes as mid-level semantic
features. Extensive experiments on the EvReID dataset and MARS datasets fully
validated the effectiveness of our proposed RGB-Event person ReID framework.

Motivation: 恶劣天气条件会显著降低图像质量并影响下游任务性能，现有基于Transformer的方法虽有效但计算复杂度高，难以实时处理。

Method: PW-FNet采用金字塔小波多输入多输出结构实现多尺度分解，并在块内用傅里叶变换替代自注意力机制以减少计算负担。

Conclusion: PW-FNet通过小波和傅里叶变换的结合，为图像修复提供了一种高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Natural image quality is often degraded by adverse weather conditions,
significantly impairing the performance of downstream tasks. Image restoration
has emerged as a core solution to this challenge and has been widely discussed
in the literature. Although recent transformer-based approaches have made
remarkable progress in image restoration, their increasing system complexity
poses significant challenges for real-time processing, particularly in
real-world deployment scenarios. To this end, most existing methods attempt to
simplify the self-attention mechanism, such as by channel self-attention or
state space model. However, these methods primarily focus on network
architecture while neglecting the inherent characteristics of image restoration
itself. In this context, we explore a pyramid Wavelet-Fourier iterative
pipeline to demonstrate the potential of Wavelet-Fourier processing for image
restoration. Inspired by the above findings, we propose a novel and efficient
restoration baseline, named Pyramid Wavelet-Fourier Network (PW-FNet).
Specifically, PW-FNet features two key design principles: 1) at the inter-block
level, integrates a pyramid wavelet-based multi-input multi-output structure to
achieve multi-scale and multi-frequency bands decomposition; and 2) at the
intra-block level, incorporates Fourier transforms as an efficient alternative
to self-attention mechanisms, effectively reducing computational complexity
while preserving global modeling capability. Extensive experiments on tasks
such as image deraining, raindrop removal, image super-resolution, motion
deblurring, image dehazing, image desnowing and underwater/low-light
enhancement demonstrate that PW-FNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art
methods in restoration quality but also achieves superior efficiency, with
significantly reduced parameter size, computational cost and inference time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RGB图像几何模糊性和交互中严重遮挡导致的3D手-物体姿态估计难题。

Method: 采用MAE的掩码-重建策略，引入区域特定掩码比率分配和SDF驱动的多模态学习。

Result: 实验表明，MaskHOI显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MaskHOI通过几何感知和遮挡鲁棒性学习，有效提升了3D手-物体交互姿态估计的精度。

Abstract: In 3D hand-object interaction (HOI) tasks, estimating precise joint poses of
hands and objects from monocular RGB input remains highly challenging due to
the inherent geometric ambiguity of RGB images and the severe mutual occlusions
that occur during interaction.To address these challenges, we propose MaskHOI,
a novel Masked Autoencoder (MAE)-driven pretraining framework for enhanced HOI
pose estimation. Our core idea is to leverage the masking-then-reconstruction
strategy of MAE to encourage the feature encoder to infer missing spatial and
structural information, thereby facilitating geometric-aware and
occlusion-robust representation learning. Specifically, based on our
observation that human hands exhibit far greater geometric complexity than
rigid objects, conventional uniform masking fails to effectively guide the
reconstruction of fine-grained hand structures. To overcome this limitation, we
introduce a Region-specific Mask Ratio Allocation, primarily comprising the
region-specific masking assignment and the skeleton-driven hand masking
guidance. The former adaptively assigns lower masking ratios to hand regions
than to rigid objects, balancing their feature learning difficulty, while the
latter prioritizes masking critical hand parts (e.g., fingertips or entire
fingers) to realistically simulate occlusion patterns in real-world
interactions. Furthermore, to enhance the geometric awareness of the pretrained
encoder, we introduce a novel Masked Signed Distance Field (SDF)-driven
multimodal learning mechanism. Through the self-masking 3D SDF prediction, the
learned encoder is able to perceive the global geometric structure of hands and
objects beyond the 2D image plane, overcoming the inherent limitations of
monocular input and alleviating self-occlusion issues. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的V2X协同感知系统因成本限制和部署差异导致传感器配置异构，这给特征融合和感知可靠性带来了挑战。

Method: 提出HeCoFuse框架，采用分层融合机制（通道和空间注意力）和自适应空间分辨率调整模块，并结合动态调整融合类型的协同学习策略。

Result: 在TUMTraf-V2X数据集上，HeCoFuse在多种传感器配置下表现优异，3D mAP最高达43.38%，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HeCoFuse在异构传感器配置下表现出色，成为当前TUM-Traf V2X数据集上的最先进方法。

Abstract: Real-world Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperative perception systems often
operate under heterogeneous sensor configurations due to cost constraints and
deployment variability across vehicles and infrastructure. This heterogeneity
poses significant challenges for feature fusion and perception reliability. To
address these issues, we propose HeCoFuse, a unified framework designed for
cooperative perception across mixed sensor setups where nodes may carry Cameras
(C), LiDARs (L), or both. By introducing a hierarchical fusion mechanism that
adaptively weights features through a combination of channel-wise and spatial
attention, HeCoFuse can tackle critical challenges such as cross-modality
feature misalignment and imbalanced representation quality. In addition, an
adaptive spatial resolution adjustment module is employed to balance
computational cost and fusion effectiveness. To enhance robustness across
different configurations, we further implement a cooperative learning strategy
that dynamically adjusts fusion type based on available modalities. Experiments
on the real-world TUMTraf-V2X dataset demonstrate that HeCoFuse achieves 43.22%
3D mAP under the full sensor configuration (LC+LC), outperforming the CoopDet3D
baseline by 1.17%, and reaches an even higher 43.38% 3D mAP in the L+LC
scenario, while maintaining 3D mAP in the range of 21.74% to 43.38% across nine
heterogeneous sensor configurations. These results, validated by our
first-place finish in the CVPR 2025 DriveX challenge, establish HeCoFuse as the
current state-of-the-art on TUM-Traf V2X dataset while demonstrating robust
performance across diverse sensor deployments.

Motivation: 结构健康监测需求增长，需要高精度运动测量技术。视觉方法成本低、易安装，但现有方法在亚像素级测量中精度不足或需大量手动调参。

Method: 开发了一种基于高斯核的运动测量方法，通过跟踪高斯核位置提取帧间运动，引入运动一致性和超分辨率约束以提高精度和鲁棒性。

Result: 数值和实验验证表明，该方法无需针对不同样本定制参数即可达到高精度。

Conclusion: 该方法为结构健康监测提供了一种高精度、无需手动调参的视觉运动测量解决方案。

Abstract: The growing demand for structural health monitoring has driven increasing
interest in high-precision motion measurement, as structural information
derived from extracted motions can effectively reflect the current condition of
the structure. Among various motion measurement techniques, vision-based
methods stand out due to their low cost, easy installation, and large-scale
measurement. However, when it comes to sub-pixel-level motion measurement,
current vision-based methods either lack sufficient accuracy or require
extensive manual parameter tuning (e.g., pyramid layers, target pixels, and
filter parameters) to reach good precision. To address this issue, we developed
a novel Gaussian kernel-based motion measurement method, which can extract the
motion between different frames via tracking the location of Gaussian kernels.
The motion consistency, which fits practical structural conditions, and a
super-resolution constraint, are introduced to increase accuracy and robustness
of our method. Numerical and experimental validations show that it can
consistently reach high accuracy without customized parameter setup for
different test samples.

Result: 通过仿真实验，验证了T-GOSPA准度量在评估贝叶斯MOT算法性能时的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的准度量在多目标跟踪评估中更具灵活性，适用于特定应用场景。

Abstract: This paper introduces two quasi-metrics for performance assessment of
multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms. In particular, one quasi-metric is an
extension of the generalised optimal subpattern assignment (GOSPA) metric and
measures the discrepancy between sets of objects. The other quasi-metric is an
extension of the trajectory GOSPA (T-GOSPA) metric and measures the discrepancy
between sets of trajectories. Similar to the GOSPA-based metrics, these
quasi-metrics include costs for localisation error for properly detected
objects, the number of false objects and the number of missed objects. The
T-GOSPA quasi-metric also includes a track switching cost. Differently from the
GOSPA and T-GOSPA metrics, the proposed quasi-metrics have the flexibility of
penalising missed and false objects with different costs, and the localisation
costs are not required to be symmetric. These properties can be useful in MOT
evaluation in certain applications. The performance of several Bayesian MOT
algorithms is assessed with the T-GOSPA quasi-metric via simulations.

Conclusion: PoemTale Diffusion为诗歌到图像生成提供了新视角，增强了生成图像的信息表达能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models have achieved
remarkable success in generating realistic and diverse visual content. A
critical factor in this process is the model's ability to accurately interpret
textual prompts. However, these models often struggle with creative
expressions, particularly those involving complex, abstract, or highly
descriptive language. In this work, we introduce a novel training-free approach
tailored to improve image generation for a unique form of creative language:
poetic verse, which frequently features layered, abstract, and dual meanings.
Our proposed PoemTale Diffusion approach aims to minimise the information that
is lost during poetic text-to-image conversion by integrating a multi stage
prompt refinement loop into Language Models to enhance the interpretability of
poetic texts. To support this, we adapt existing state-of-the-art diffusion
models by modifying their self-attention mechanisms with a consistent
self-attention technique to generate multiple consistent images, which are then
collectively used to convey the poem's meaning. Moreover, to encourage research
in the field of poetry, we introduce the P4I (PoemForImage) dataset, consisting
of 1111 poems sourced from multiple online and offline resources. We engaged a
panel of poetry experts for qualitative assessments. The results from both
human and quantitative evaluations validate the efficacy of our method and
contribute a novel perspective to poem-to-image generation with enhanced
information capture in the generated images.

Conclusion: StyleGAN的高可控性带来学术价值，但也存在被滥用于伪造身份等伦理问题。

Abstract: In today's digital age, concerns about the dangers of AI-generated images are
increasingly common. One powerful tool in this domain is StyleGAN (style-based
generative adversarial networks), a generative adversarial network capable of
producing highly realistic synthetic faces. To gain a deeper understanding of
how such a model operates, this work focuses on analyzing the inner workings of
StyleGAN's generator component. Key architectural elements and techniques, such
as the Equalized Learning Rate, are explored in detail to shed light on the
model's behavior. A StyleGAN model is trained using the PyTorch framework,
enabling direct inspection of its learned weights. Through pruning, it is
revealed that a significant number of these weights can be removed without
drastically affecting the output, leading to reduced computational
requirements. Moreover, the role of the latent vector -- which heavily
influences the appearance of the generated faces -- is closely examined. Global
alterations to this vector primarily affect aspects like color tones, while
targeted changes to individual dimensions allow for precise manipulation of
specific facial features. This ability to finetune visual traits is not only of
academic interest but also highlights a serious ethical concern: the potential
misuse of such technology. Malicious actors could exploit this capability to
fabricate convincing fake identities, posing significant risks in the context
of digital deception and cybercrime.

Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) is challenging due to extremely
limited training data; while aiming to reduce catastrophic forgetting and learn
new information. We propose Diffusion-FSCIL, a novel approach that employs a
text-to-image diffusion model as a frozen backbone. Our conjecture is that
FSCIL can be tackled using a large generative model's capabilities benefiting
from 1) generation ability via large-scale pre-training; 2) multi-scale
representation; 3) representational flexibility through the text encoder. To
maximize the representation capability, we propose to extract multiple
complementary diffusion features to play roles as latent replay with slight
support from feature distillation for preventing generative biases. Our
framework realizes efficiency through 1) using a frozen backbone; 2) minimal
trainable components; 3) batch processing of multiple feature extractions.
Extensive experiments on CUB-200, \emph{mini}ImageNet, and CIFAR-100 show that
Diffusion-FSCIL surpasses state-of-the-art methods, preserving performance on
previously learned classes and adapting effectively to new ones.

Method: 利用预训练的T2I模型优化低质量视频帧，同时使用T2V模型确保运动一致性。

Result: 实验表明，EVS在视觉质量和运动平滑性上优于现有方法，推理速度提升1.6x-4.5x。

Conclusion: EVS通过结合T2I和T2V模型的优势，显著提升了视频生成的质量和效率。

Abstract: In recent years, large text-to-video (T2V) synthesis models have garnered
considerable attention for their abilities to generate videos from textual
descriptions. However, achieving both high imaging quality and effective motion
representation remains a significant challenge for these T2V models. Existing
approaches often adapt pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models to refine video
frames, leading to issues such as flickering and artifacts due to
inconsistencies across frames. In this paper, we introduce EVS, a training-free
Encapsulated Video Synthesizer that composes T2I and T2V models to enhance both
visual fidelity and motion smoothness of generated videos. Our approach
utilizes a well-trained diffusion-based T2I model to refine low-quality video
frames by treating them as out-of-distribution samples, effectively optimizing
them with noising and denoising steps. Meanwhile, we employ T2V backbones to
ensure consistent motion dynamics. By encapsulating the T2V temporal-only prior
into the T2I generation process, EVS successfully leverages the strengths of
both types of models, resulting in videos of improved imaging and motion
quality. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach
compared to previous approaches. Our composition process also leads to a
significant improvement of 1.6x-4.5x speedup in inference time. Source codes:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于扩散模型的光谱扩散先验（SDP）和光谱先验注入模块（SPIM），用于提升高光谱图像（HSI）重建的高频细节恢复能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在HSI重建中难以准确捕捉高频细节，需要一种更有效的方法来提升性能。

Method: 通过扩散模型隐式学习SDP，并结合SPIM动态指导模型恢复HSI细节。

Result: 在MST和BISRNet两种HSI方法上，性能提升约0.5 dB。

Conclusion: SDP和SPIM显著提升了HSI重建的细节恢复能力，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction aims to recover 3D HSI from its
degraded 2D measurements. Recently great progress has been made in deep
learning-based methods, however, these methods often struggle to accurately
capture high-frequency details of the HSI. To address this issue, this paper
proposes a Spectral Diffusion Prior (SDP) that is implicitly learned from
hyperspectral images using a diffusion model. Leveraging the powerful ability
of the diffusion model to reconstruct details, this learned prior can
significantly improve the performance when injected into the HSI model. To
further improve the effectiveness of the learned prior, we also propose the
Spectral Prior Injector Module (SPIM) to dynamically guide the model to recover
the HSI details. We evaluate our method on two representative HSI methods: MST
and BISRNet. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing
networks by about 0.5 dB, effectively improving the performance of HSI
reconstruction.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于排列熵（PE）的新型图像分类方法，结合HOG和LBP特征，训练SVM分类器，在多个基准数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在图像分类中，特征工程仍然重要，尤其是在需要解释性和计算效率的场景。本文旨在探索一种轻量级且可解释的替代方案，避免使用复杂的深度学习模型。

Method: 将PE扩展到二维图像，提出多尺度、多方向的熵特征提取方法，结合HOG和LBP特征，形成780维特征集，训练SVM分类器。

Result: 在Fashion-MNIST、KMNIST、EMNIST和CIFAR-10等数据集上表现优异，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: PE与HOG和LBP的结合提供了一种轻量级、可解释且高效的图像分类方案，为可解释机器学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Feature engineering continues to play a critical role in image
classification, particularly when interpretability and computational efficiency
are prioritized over deep learning models with millions of parameters. In this
study, we revisit classical machine learning based image classification through
a novel approach centered on Permutation Entropy (PE), a robust and
computationally lightweight measure traditionally used in time series analysis
but rarely applied to image data. We extend PE to two-dimensional images and
propose a multiscale, multi-orientation entropy-based feature extraction
approach that characterizes spatial order and complexity along rows, columns,
diagonals, anti-diagonals, and local patches of the image. To enhance the
discriminatory power of the entropy features, we integrate two classic image
descriptors: the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) to capture shape and
edge structure, and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) to encode micro-texture of an
image. The resulting hand-crafted feature set, comprising of 780 dimensions, is
used to train Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers optimized through grid
search. The proposed approach is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets,
including Fashion-MNIST, KMNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10, where it delivers
competitive classification performance without relying on deep architectures.
Our results demonstrate that the fusion of PE with HOG and LBP provides a
compact, interpretable, and effective alternative to computationally expensive
and limited interpretable deep learning models. This shows a potential of
entropy-based descriptors in image classification and contributes a lightweight
and generalizable solution to interpretable machine learning in image
classification and computer vision.

Motivation: 现有方法主要通过重述问题解决模糊性，忽略了用户反馈的交互性。

Method: 引入 ClearVQA 基准测试，针对三类常见模糊问题，覆盖多种 VQA 场景。

Result: 解决了缺乏评估交互澄清能力的基准和模型偏好回答而非提问的问题。

Conclusion: ClearVQA 为交互式澄清提供了新的评估框架。

Abstract: In visual question answering (VQA) context, users often pose ambiguous
questions to visual language models (VLMs) due to varying expression habits.
Existing research addresses such ambiguities primarily by rephrasing questions.
These approaches neglect the inherently interactive nature of user interactions
with VLMs, where ambiguities can be clarified through user feedback. However,
research on interactive clarification faces two major challenges: (1)
Benchmarks are absent to assess VLMs' capacity for resolving ambiguities
through interaction; (2) VLMs are trained to prefer answering rather than
asking, preventing them from seeking clarification. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce \textbf{ClearVQA} benchmark, which targets three
common categories of ambiguity in VQA context, and encompasses various VQA
scenarios.

Conclusion: 显式可微分聚类模块在半监督学习和无监督域适应中具有显著优势，尤其在低监督条件下表现突出。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA)
enhance the model performance by exploiting information from labeled and
unlabeled data. The clustering assumption has proven advantageous for learning
with limited supervision and states that data points belonging to the same
cluster in a high-dimensional space should be assigned to the same category.
Recent works have utilized different training mechanisms to implicitly enforce
this assumption for the SSL and UDA. In this work, we take a different approach
by explicitly involving a differentiable clustering module which is extended to
leverage the supervised data to compute its centroids. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our straightforward end-to-end training strategy for SSL and
UDA over extensive experiments and highlight its benefits, especially in low
supervision regimes, both as a standalone model and as a regularizer for
existing approaches.

Conclusion: 自动化方法显著提升了数据规模和标注效率，推动了图像编辑领域的研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling enable image editing assistants that
follow natural language instructions without additional user input. Their
supervised training requires millions of triplets: original image, instruction,
edited image. Yet mining pixel-accurate examples is hard. Each edit must affect
only prompt-specified regions, preserve stylistic coherence, respect physical
plausibility, and retain visual appeal. The lack of robust automated
edit-quality metrics hinders reliable automation at scale. We present an
automated, modular pipeline that mines high-fidelity triplets across domains,
resolutions, instruction complexities, and styles. Built on public generative
models and running without human intervention, our system uses a task-tuned
Gemini validator to score instruction adherence and aesthetics directly,
removing any need for segmentation or grounding models. Inversion and
compositional bootstrapping enlarge the mined set by approximately 2.2x,
enabling large-scale high-fidelity training data. By automating the most
repetitive annotation steps, the approach allows a new scale of training
without human labeling effort. To democratize research in this
resource-intensive area, we release NHR-Edit: an open dataset of 358k
high-quality triplets. In the largest cross-dataset evaluation, it surpasses
all public alternatives. We also release Bagel-NHR-Edit, an open-source
fine-tuned Bagel model, which achieves state-of-the-art metrics in our
experiments.

Motivation: 磁共振血流成像的低时空分辨率和信噪比限制了其诊断价值，需要一种新方法来提升分辨率和预测能力。

Method: LoFNO结合拉普拉斯特征向量作为几何先验，增强对不规则几何结构的感知，并采用EDSR层进行鲁棒的上采样。

Result: LoFNO在速度和WSS预测上优于插值和其他深度学习方法，实现了更精确的脑血管诊断。

Conclusion: LoFNO通过整合几何先验和神经算子框架，显著提升了血流数据的时空分辨率和诊断能力。

Abstract: Hemodynamic analysis is essential for predicting aneurysm rupture and guiding
treatment. While magnetic resonance flow imaging enables time-resolved
volumetric blood velocity measurements, its low spatiotemporal resolution and
signal-to-noise ratio limit its diagnostic utility. To address this, we propose
the Localized Fourier Neural Operator (LoFNO), a novel 3D architecture that
enhances both spatial and temporal resolution with the ability to predict wall
shear stress (WSS) directly from clinical imaging data. LoFNO integrates
Laplacian eigenvectors as geometric priors for improved structural awareness on
irregular, unseen geometries and employs an Enhanced Deep Super-Resolution
Network (EDSR) layer for robust upsampling. By combining geometric priors with
neural operator frameworks, LoFNO de-noises and spatiotemporally upsamples flow
data, achieving superior velocity and WSS predictions compared to interpolation
and alternative deep learning methods, enabling more precise cerebrovascular
diagnostics.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法在盲脸修复中常因固定扩散时间步和全局引导尺度导致保真度与质量不平衡，需要更灵活的方法。

Result: DynFaceRestore在定量和定性评估中均达到最先进性能，表现出鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功平衡了保真度和质量，为盲脸修复提供了新思路。

Abstract: Blind Face Restoration aims to recover high-fidelity, detail-rich facial
images from unknown degraded inputs, presenting significant challenges in
preserving both identity and detail. Pre-trained diffusion models have been
increasingly used as image priors to generate fine details. Still, existing
methods often use fixed diffusion sampling timesteps and a global guidance
scale, assuming uniform degradation. This limitation and potentially imperfect
degradation kernel estimation frequently lead to under- or over-diffusion,
resulting in an imbalance between fidelity and quality. We propose
DynFaceRestore, a novel blind face restoration approach that learns to map any
blindly degraded input to Gaussian blurry images. By leveraging these blurry
images and their respective Gaussian kernels, we dynamically select the
starting timesteps for each blurry image and apply closed-form guidance during
the diffusion sampling process to maintain fidelity. Additionally, we introduce
a dynamic guidance scaling adjuster that modulates the guidance strength across
local regions, enhancing detail generation in complex areas while preserving
structural fidelity in contours. This strategy effectively balances the
trade-off between fidelity and quality. DynFaceRestore achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations,
demonstrating robustness and effectiveness in blind face restoration.

Conclusion: CF-SSC通过时空建模有效解决了单目方法的局限性，为自动驾驶感知任务提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, visual 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has emerged as a
critical perception task for autonomous driving due to its ability to infer
complete 3D scene layouts and semantics from single 2D images. However, in
real-world traffic scenarios, a significant portion of the scene remains
occluded or outside the camera's field of view -- a fundamental challenge that
existing monocular SSC methods fail to address adequately. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Creating the Future SSC (CF-SSC), a novel temporal SSC
framework that leverages pseudo-future frame prediction to expand the model's
effective perceptual range. Our approach combines poses and depths to establish
accurate 3D correspondences, enabling geometrically-consistent fusion of past,
present, and predicted future frames in 3D space. Unlike conventional methods
that rely on simple feature stacking, our 3D-aware architecture achieves more
robust scene completion by explicitly modeling spatial-temporal relationships.
Comprehensive experiments on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our
approach, highlighting our method's ability to improve occlusion reasoning and
3D scene completion accuracy.

Motivation: 现有多模态融合系统在资源受限环境中面临高模型复杂度、单向模态对齐和缺失模态导致的鲁棒性问题，亟需高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 结合线性复杂度的Mamba模型处理传感器时间序列，优化GRAM矩阵策略实现模态间对齐，并引入低秩自适应层补偿缺失模态。

Result: 在SPAWC2021和USC-HAD数据集上，GRAM-MAMBA表现优于基线，缺失模态适应性能提升显著，训练参数极少。

Conclusion: GRAM-MAMBA为资源受限环境中的多模态感知提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-modal fusion is crucial for Internet of Things (IoT) perception, widely
deployed in smart homes, intelligent transport, industrial automation, and
healthcare. However, existing systems often face challenges: high model
complexity hinders deployment in resource-constrained environments,
unidirectional modal alignment neglects inter-modal relationships, and
robustness suffers when sensor data is missing. These issues impede efficient
and robust multimodal perception in real-world IoT settings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GRAM-MAMBA. This framework utilizes the
linear-complexity Mamba model for efficient sensor time-series processing,
combined with an optimized GRAM matrix strategy for pairwise alignment among
modalities, addressing the shortcomings of traditional single-modality
alignment. Inspired by Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we introduce an adaptive
low-rank layer compensation strategy to handle missing modalities
post-training. This strategy freezes the pre-trained model core and irrelevant
adaptive layers, fine-tuning only those related to available modalities and the
fusion process. Extensive experiments validate GRAM-MAMBA's effectiveness. On
the SPAWC2021 indoor positioning dataset, the pre-trained model shows lower
error than baselines; adapting to missing modalities yields a 24.5% performance
boost by training less than 0.2% of parameters. On the USC-HAD human activity
recognition dataset, it achieves 93.55% F1 and 93.81% Overall Accuracy (OA),
outperforming prior work; the update strategy increases F1 by 23% while
training less than 0.3% of parameters. These results highlight GRAM-MAMBA's
potential for achieving efficient and robust multimodal perception in
resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: SkySense V2通过统一架构和针对性预训练策略，显著提升了多模态遥感任务的性能。

Abstract: The multi-modal remote sensing foundation model (MM-RSFM) has significantly
advanced various Earth observation tasks, such as urban planning, environmental
monitoring, and natural disaster management. However, most existing approaches
generally require the training of separate backbone networks for each data
modality, leading to redundancy and inefficient parameter utilization.
Moreover, prevalent pre-training methods typically apply self-supervised
learning (SSL) techniques from natural images without adequately accommodating
the characteristics of remote sensing (RS) images, such as the complicated
semantic distribution within a single RS image. In this work, we present
SkySense V2, a unified MM-RSFM that employs a single transformer backbone to
handle multiple modalities. This backbone is pre-trained with a novel SSL
strategy tailored to the distinct traits of RS data. In particular, SkySense V2
incorporates an innovative adaptive patch merging module and learnable modality
prompt tokens to address challenges related to varying resolutions and limited
feature diversity across modalities. In additional, we incorporate the mixture
of experts (MoE) module to further enhance the performance of the foundation
model. SkySense V2 demonstrates impressive generalization abilities through an
extensive evaluation involving 16 datasets over 7 tasks, outperforming SkySense

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for open-ended video question answering that
enhances reasoning depth and robustness in complex real-world scenarios, as
benchmarked on the CVRR-ES dataset. Existing Video-Large Multimodal Models
(Video-LMMs) often exhibit limited contextual understanding, weak temporal
modeling, and poor generalization to ambiguous or compositional queries. To
address these challenges, we introduce a prompting-and-response integration
mechanism that coordinates multiple heterogeneous Video-Language Models (VLMs)
via structured chains of thought, each tailored to distinct reasoning pathways.
An external Large Language Model (LLM) serves as an evaluator and integrator,
selecting and fusing the most reliable responses. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines across
all evaluation metrics, showcasing superior generalization and robustness. Our
approach offers a lightweight, extensible strategy for advancing multimodal
reasoning without requiring model retraining, setting a strong foundation for
future Video-LMM development.

Abstract: Building segmentation in urban areas is essential in fields such as urban

buildings in dense urban regions presents challenges due to the large size and
high resolution of satellite images. This study investigates the use of a
Quanvolutional pre-processing to enhance the capability of the Attention U-Net
model in the building segmentation. Specifically, this paper focuses on the
urban landscape of Tunis, utilizing Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
imagery. In this work, Quanvolution was used to extract more informative
feature maps that capture essential structural details in radar imagery,
proving beneficial for accurate building segmentation. Preliminary results
indicate that proposed methodology achieves comparable test accuracy to the
standard Attention U-Net model while significantly reducing network parameters.
This result aligns with findings from previous works, confirming that
Quanvolution not only maintains model accuracy but also increases computational
efficiency. These promising outcomes highlight the potential of

Result: 在OpenLane基准测试中表现优异，且无需相机标定即可应用。

Conclusion: Depth3DLane提供了一种高效且广泛适用的单目3D车道检测解决方案。

Abstract: Monocular 3D lane detection is essential for autonomous driving, but
challenging due to the inherent lack of explicit spatial information.
Multi-modal approaches rely on expensive depth sensors, while methods
incorporating fully-supervised depth networks rely on ground-truth depth data
that is impractical to collect at scale. Additionally, existing methods assume
that camera parameters are available, limiting their applicability in scenarios
like crowdsourced high-definition (HD) lane mapping. To address these
limitations, we propose Depth3DLane, a novel dual-pathway framework that
integrates self-supervised monocular depth estimation to provide explicit
structural information, without the need for expensive sensors or additional
ground-truth depth data. Leveraging a self-supervised depth network to obtain a
point cloud representation of the scene, our bird's-eye view pathway extracts
explicit spatial information, while our front view pathway simultaneously
extracts rich semantic information. Depth3DLane then uses 3D lane anchors to
sample features from both pathways and infer accurate 3D lane geometry.
Furthermore, we extend the framework to predict camera parameters on a
per-frame basis and introduce a theoretically motivated fitting procedure to
enhance stability on a per-segment basis. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that Depth3DLane achieves competitive performance on the OpenLane benchmark
dataset. Furthermore, experimental results show that using learned parameters
instead of ground-truth parameters allows Depth3DLane to be applied in
scenarios where camera calibration is infeasible, unlike previous methods.

Abstract: Recent subject-driven image customization has achieved significant
advancements in fidelity, yet fine-grained entity-level spatial control remains
elusive, hindering the broader real-world application. This limitation is
mainly attributed to scalable datasets that bind identity with precise
positional cues are absent. To this end, we introduce PositionIC, a unified
framework that enforces position and identity consistency for multi-subject
customization. We construct a scalable synthesis pipeline that employs a
bidirectional generation paradigm to eliminate subject drift and maintain
semantic coherence. On top of these data, we design a lightweight positional
modulation layer that decouples spatial embeddings among subjects, enabling
independent, accurate placement while preserving visual fidelity. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach can achieve precise spatial control
while maintaining high consistency in image customization task. PositionIC
paves the way for controllable, high-fidelity image customization in
open-world, multi-entity scenarios and will be released to foster further
research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在处理复杂任务时，常面临内部参数知识与外部信息冲突的问题，导致幻觉和不可靠响应。研究旨在揭示这些冲突的机制。

Method: 引入多模态反事实查询数据集，通过logit检查定位控制冲突的关键注意力头，并修改这些头以引导模型行为。

Result: 研究发现少量注意力头控制冲突，修改这些头可引导模型偏向内部知识或视觉输入；这些头的注意力定位能力优于基于梯度的归因方法。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了VLMs处理知识冲突的机制，为模型可靠性和可控性提供了新方法。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly leverage diverse knowledge sources
to address complex tasks, often encountering conflicts between their internal
parametric knowledge and external information. Knowledge conflicts can result
in hallucinations and unreliable responses, but the mechanisms governing such
interactions remain unknown. To address this gap, we analyze the mechanisms
that VLMs use to resolve cross-modal conflicts by introducing a dataset of
multimodal counterfactual queries that deliberately contradict internal
commonsense knowledge. We localize with logit inspection a small set of heads
that control the conflict. Moreover, by modifying these heads, we can steer the
model towards its internal knowledge or the visual inputs. Finally, we show
that attention from such heads pinpoints localized image regions driving visual
overrides, outperforming gradient-based attribution in precision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态和挑战性海洋环境中目标定位和关联准确性的问题。

Result: 在真实海洋场景数据集上，显著提升了目标定位和关联的准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法在动态和复杂环境中优于基线方法，为海洋视觉增强提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to enhancing marine vision by fusing
real-time visual data with chart information. Our system overlays nautical
chart data onto live video feeds by accurately matching detected navigational
aids, such as buoys, with their corresponding representations in chart data. To
achieve robust association, we introduce a transformer-based end-to-end neural
network that predicts bounding boxes and confidence scores for buoy queries,
enabling the direct matching of image-domain detections with world-space chart
markers. The proposed method is compared against baseline approaches, including
a ray-casting model that estimates buoy positions via camera projection and a
YOLOv7-based network extended with a distance estimation module. Experimental
results on a dataset of real-world maritime scenes demonstrate that our
approach significantly improves object localization and association accuracy in
dynamic and challenging environments.

TL;DR: PCR-GS是一种无需COLMAP的3D高斯泼溅技术，通过相机姿态共正则化提升复杂场景下的3D建模和相机姿态估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂相机轨迹（如剧烈旋转和平移）下表现不佳，导致相机姿态估计和3D建模的联合优化陷入局部极小值。

Method: PCR-GS通过特征重投影正则化和基于小波的高频正则化，分别从语义对齐和高频细节优化相机姿态。

Result: 实验表明，PCR-GS在剧烈变化的相机轨迹下实现了优越的无姿态3D场景建模。

Conclusion: PCR-GS通过创新的正则化方法显著提升了复杂场景下的3D建模和相机姿态估计性能。

Abstract: COLMAP-free 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has recently attracted increasing
attention due to its remarkable performance in reconstructing high-quality 3D
scenes from unposed images or videos. However, it often struggles to handle
scenes with complex camera trajectories as featured by drastic rotation and
translation across adjacent camera views, leading to degraded estimation of
camera poses and further local minima in joint optimization of camera poses and
3D-GS. We propose PCR-GS, an innovative COLMAP-free 3DGS technique that
achieves superior 3D scene modeling and camera pose estimation via camera pose
co-regularization. PCR-GS achieves regularization from two perspectives. The
first is feature reprojection regularization which extracts view-robust DINO
features from adjacent camera views and aligns their semantic information for
camera pose regularization. The second is wavelet-based frequency
regularization which exploits discrepancy in high-frequency details to further
optimize the rotation matrix in camera poses. Extensive experiments over
multiple real-world scenes show that the proposed PCR-GS achieves superior
pose-free 3D-GS scene modeling under dramatic changes of camera trajectories.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用DepthAnything生成的深度先验来增强LiDAR点云特征的方法，通过双路径RoI特征提取和双向门控融合模块，显著提升了3D目标检测的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LiDAR点云特征表达能力有限，尤其是反射率属性区分能力较弱，而DepthAnything提供的深度先验可以弥补这一不足。

Method: 将DepthAnything预测的深度先验与LiDAR原始属性融合，提出点级特征提取模块和双路径RoI特征提取框架（体素分支和点分支），并设计双向门控RoI特征融合模块。

Result: 在KITTI基准测试中，检测精度显著提升。

Conclusion: 将视觉基础模型的先验引入LiDAR 3D目标检测具有重要价值。

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have opened up new possibilities for
enhancing 3D perception. In particular, DepthAnything offers dense and reliable
geometric priors from monocular RGB images, which can complement sparse LiDAR
data in autonomous driving scenarios. However, such priors remain underutilized
in LiDAR-based 3D object detection. In this paper, we address the limited
expressiveness of raw LiDAR point features, especially the weak discriminative
capability of the reflectance attribute, by introducing depth priors predicted
by DepthAnything. These priors are fused with the original LiDAR attributes to
enrich each point's representation. To leverage the enhanced point features, we
propose a point-wise feature extraction module. Then, a Dual-Path RoI feature
extraction framework is employed, comprising a voxel-based branch for global
semantic context and a point-based branch for fine-grained structural details.
To effectively integrate the complementary RoI features, we introduce a
bidirectional gated RoI feature fusion module that balances global and local
cues. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark show that our method
consistently improves detection accuracy, demonstrating the value of
incorporating visual foundation model priors into LiDAR-based 3D object
detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TimeNeRF是一种通用的神经渲染方法，能够在任意视角和时间渲染新视图，即使输入视图很少。它结合多视图立体、神经辐射场和解缠策略，实现少样本泛化能力，并能构建任意时间的神经辐射场。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，收集多视图成本高且效率低，而元宇宙等数字领域需要能够自然过渡昼夜的3D环境建模。现有NeRF技术在时间建模方面潜力未充分探索。

Method: 结合多视图立体、神经辐射场和解缠策略，构建隐式内容辐射场，支持少样本泛化和任意时间的辐射场建模。

Result: TimeNeRF在少样本设置下无需逐场景优化即可渲染新视图，并能平滑过渡不同时间的自然场景变化。

Conclusion: TimeNeRF在少样本泛化和时间动态场景建模方面表现出色，为沉浸式3D体验提供了新工具。

Abstract: We present TimeNeRF, a generalizable neural rendering approach for rendering
novel views at arbitrary viewpoints and at arbitrary times, even with few input
views. For real-world applications, it is expensive to collect multiple views
and inefficient to re-optimize for unseen scenes. Moreover, as the digital
realm, particularly the metaverse, strives for increasingly immersive
experiences, the ability to model 3D environments that naturally transition
between day and night becomes paramount. While current techniques based on
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown remarkable proficiency in synthesizing
novel views, the exploration of NeRF's potential for temporal 3D scene modeling
remains limited, with no dedicated datasets available for this purpose. To this
end, our approach harnesses the strengths of multi-view stereo, neural radiance
fields, and disentanglement strategies across diverse datasets. This equips our
model with the capability for generalizability in a few-shot setting, allows us
to construct an implicit content radiance field for scene representation, and
further enables the building of neural radiance fields at any arbitrary time.
Finally, we synthesize novel views of that time via volume rendering.
Experiments show that TimeNeRF can render novel views in a few-shot setting
without per-scene optimization. Most notably, it excels in creating realistic
novel views that transition smoothly across different times, adeptly capturing
intricate natural scene changes from dawn to dusk.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiViD是一个端到端的视频扩散框架，用于显式分离静态外观和动态运动，通过全局静态令牌和帧特定动态令牌实现，并在实验中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于VAE和GAN的方法在视频中分离静态和动态内容时存在信息泄漏和模糊重建问题，DiViD旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: DiViD使用序列编码器提取全局静态令牌和帧特定动态令牌，结合条件DDPM解码器，引入共享噪声计划、时间变化的KL瓶颈和交叉注意力机制，并通过正交正则化防止泄漏。

Result: DiViD在真实世界基准测试中表现优异，实现了最高的交换联合准确率，保持了静态保真度并改善了动态传输，同时减少了交叉泄漏。

Conclusion: DiViD通过显式静态-动态分解和创新的扩散框架，显著提升了视频中静态和动态内容的分离效果。

Abstract: Unsupervised disentanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion in video
remains a fundamental challenge, often hindered by information leakage and
blurry reconstructions in existing VAE- and GAN-based approaches. We introduce
DiViD, the first end-to-end video diffusion framework for explicit
static-dynamic factorization. DiViD's sequence encoder extracts a global static
token from the first frame and per-frame dynamic tokens, explicitly removing
static content from the motion code. Its conditional DDPM decoder incorporates
three key inductive biases: a shared-noise schedule for temporal consistency, a
time-varying KL-based bottleneck that tightens at early timesteps (compressing
static information) and relaxes later (enriching dynamics), and cross-attention
that routes the global static token to all frames while keeping dynamic tokens
frame-specific. An orthogonality regularizer further prevents residual
static-dynamic leakage. We evaluate DiViD on real-world benchmarks using
swap-based accuracy and cross-leakage metrics. DiViD outperforms
state-of-the-art sequential disentanglement methods: it achieves the highest
swap-based joint accuracy, preserves static fidelity while improving dynamic
transfer, and reduces average cross-leakage.

Conclusion: 结合表征学习和生成模型对时间基础视频理解具有重要价值。

Abstract: Forecasting what will happen next is a critical skill for general-purpose
systems that plan or act in the world at different levels of abstraction. In
this paper, we identify a strong correlation between a vision model's
perceptual ability and its generalist forecasting performance over short time
horizons. This trend holds across a diverse set of pretrained models-including
those trained generatively-and across multiple levels of abstraction, from raw
pixels to depth, point tracks, and object motion. The result is made possible
by a novel generalist forecasting framework that operates on any frozen vision
backbone: we train latent diffusion models to forecast future features in the
frozen representation space, which are then decoded via lightweight,
task-specific readouts. To enable consistent evaluation across tasks, we
introduce distributional metrics that compare distributional properties
directly in the space of downstream tasks and apply this framework to nine
models and four tasks. Our results highlight the value of bridging
representation learning and generative modeling for temporally grounded video
understanding.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-powered surveillance have intensified concerns over the

soft-biometric, and non-biometric labels to train an interpretable privacy
metric. We evaluate 11 privacy protection methods, ranging from conventional
techniques to advanced deep-learning methods, through the proposed framework.
The framework differentiates privacy levels in alignment with human visual

practicality. This study, along with the HR-VISPR dataset, serves as an
insightful tool and offers a structured evaluation framework applicable across
diverse contexts.

Result: CSD-VAR在内容保留和风格化保真度上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CSD-VAR为内容-风格分解提供了高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Disentangling content and style from a single image, known as content-style
decomposition (CSD), enables recontextualization of extracted content and
stylization of extracted styles, offering greater creative flexibility in
visual synthesis. While recent personalization methods have explored the
decomposition of explicit content style, they remain tailored for diffusion
models. Meanwhile, Visual Autoregressive Modeling (VAR) has emerged as a
promising alternative with a next-scale prediction paradigm, achieving
performance comparable to that of diffusion models. In this paper, we explore
VAR as a generative framework for CSD, leveraging its scale-wise generation
process for improved disentanglement. To this end, we propose CSD-VAR, a novel
method that introduces three key innovations: (1) a scale-aware alternating
optimization strategy that aligns content and style representation with their
respective scales to enhance separation, (2) an SVD-based rectification method
to mitigate content leakage into style representations, and (3) an Augmented
Key-Value (K-V) memory enhancing content identity preservation. To benchmark
this task, we introduce CSD-100, a dataset specifically designed for
content-style decomposition, featuring diverse subjects rendered in various
artistic styles. Experiments demonstrate that CSD-VAR outperforms prior
approaches, achieving superior content preservation and stylization fidelity.

Conclusion: DreamScene通过创新的框架设计，实现了高质量、可编辑的3D场景生成，推动了开放域3D内容创作的进步。

Abstract: Generating 3D scenes from natural language holds great promise for
applications in gaming, film, and design. However, existing methods struggle
with automation, 3D consistency, and fine-grained control. We present
DreamScene, an end-to-end framework for high-quality and editable 3D scene
generation from text or dialogue. DreamScene begins with a scene planning
module, where a GPT-4 agent infers object semantics and spatial constraints to
construct a hybrid graph. A graph-based placement algorithm then produces a
structured, collision-free layout. Based on this layout, Formation Pattern
Sampling (FPS) generates object geometry using multi-timestep sampling and
reconstructive optimization, enabling fast and realistic synthesis. To ensure
global consistent, DreamScene employs a progressive camera sampling strategy
tailored to both indoor and outdoor settings. Finally, the system supports
fine-grained scene editing, including object movement, appearance changes, and
4D dynamic motion. Experiments demonstrate that DreamScene surpasses prior
methods in quality, consistency, and flexibility, offering a practical solution
for open-domain 3D content creation. Code and demos are available at

Abstract: Tunnel lining crack is a crucial indicator of tunnels' safety status. Aiming
to classify and segment tunnel cracks with enhanced accuracy and efficiency,
this study proposes a two-step deep learning-based method. An automatic tunnel
image classification model is developed using the DenseNet-169 in the first
step. The proposed crack segmentation model in the second step is based on the
DeepLabV3+, whose internal logic is evaluated via a score-weighted visual
explanation technique. Proposed method combines tunnel image classification and
segmentation together, so that the selected images containing cracks from the
first step are segmented in the second step to improve the detection accuracy
and efficiency. The superior performances of the two-step method are validated
by experiments. The results show that the accuracy and frames per second (FPS)
of the tunnel crack classification model are 92.23% and 39.80, respectively,
which are higher than other convolutional neural networks (CNN) based and
Transformer based models. Also, the intersection over union (IoU) and F1 score
of the tunnel crack segmentation model are 57.01% and 67.44%, respectively,
outperforming other state-of-the-art models. Moreover, the provided visual
explanations in this study are conducive to understanding the "black box" of
deep learning-based models. The developed two-stage deep learning-based method
integrating visual explanations provides a basis for fast and accurate
quantitative assessment of tunnel health status.

Motivation: 情绪驱动的图像编辑在创意产业中潜力巨大，但由于情绪的抽象性和多样性，精确操作仍具挑战性。

Method: 1. 构建MoodArchive数据集（8M+图像，带层级情绪标注）；2. 开发MoodifyCLIP模型，将情绪映射为视觉属性；3. 提出Moodifier编辑模型，结合MLLMs实现无训练的情绪转换。

Abstract: Bridging emotions and visual content for emotion-driven image editing holds
great potential in creative industries, yet precise manipulation remains
challenging due to the abstract nature of emotions and their varied
manifestations across different contexts. We tackle this challenge with an
integrated approach consisting of three complementary components. First, we
introduce MoodArchive, an 8M+ image dataset with detailed hierarchical
emotional annotations generated by LLaVA and partially validated by human
evaluators. Second, we develop MoodifyCLIP, a vision-language model fine-tuned
on MoodArchive to translate abstract emotions into specific visual attributes.
Third, we propose Moodifier, a training-free editing model leveraging
MoodifyCLIP and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enable precise
emotional transformations while preserving content integrity. Our system works
across diverse domains such as character expressions, fashion design, jewelry,
and home d\'ecor, enabling creators to quickly visualize emotional variations
while preserving identity and structure. Extensive experimental evaluations
show that Moodifier outperforms existing methods in both emotional accuracy and
content preservation, providing contextually appropriate edits. By linking
abstract emotions to concrete visual changes, our solution unlocks new
possibilities for emotional content creation in real-world applications. We
will release the MoodArchive dataset, MoodifyCLIP model, and make the Moodifier
code and demo publicly available upon acceptance.

Conclusion: QuantEIT为EIT图像重建提供了一种高效、轻量且无监督的新方法，首次将量子电路引入该领域。

Abstract: Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive, low-cost bedside
imaging modality with high temporal resolution, making it suitable for bedside
monitoring. However, its inherently ill-posed inverse problem poses significant
challenges for accurate image reconstruction. Deep learning (DL)-based
approaches have shown promise but often rely on complex network architectures
with a large number of parameters, limiting efficiency and scalability. Here,
we propose an Ultra-Lightweight Quantum-Assisted Inference (QuantEIT) framework
for EIT image reconstruction. QuantEIT leverages a Quantum-Assisted Network
(QA-Net), combining parallel 2-qubit quantum circuits to generate expressive
latent representations that serve as implicit nonlinear priors, followed by a
single linear layer for conductivity reconstruction. This design drastically
reduces model complexity and parameter number. Uniquely, QuantEIT operates in
an unsupervised, training-data-free manner and represents the first integration
of quantum circuits into EIT image reconstruction. Extensive experiments on
simulated and real-world 2D and 3D EIT lung imaging data demonstrate that
QuantEIT outperforms conventional methods, achieving comparable or superior
reconstruction accuracy using only 0.2% of the parameters, with enhanced
robustness to noise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Vision Mamba的效率以扩展应用，但现有ViTs令牌压缩技术直接应用于Mamba会导致性能下降。

Method: 提出MTR框架，基于Mamba结构感知重要性评分，实现无需训练的令牌压缩。

Result: MTR在Vim-B骨干上减少40% FLOPs，ImageNet性能仅下降1.6%。

Conclusion: MTR是一种高效、无需训练的令牌压缩方法，适用于多种Mamba模型。

Abstract: Vision Mamba has emerged as a strong competitor to Vision Transformers (ViTs)
due to its ability to efficiently capture long-range dependencies with linear
computational complexity. While token reduction, an effective compression
technique in ViTs, has rarely been explored in Vision Mamba. Exploring Vision
Mamba's efficiency is essential for enabling broader applications. However, we
find that directly applying existing token reduction techniques for ViTs to
Vision Mamba leads to significant performance degradation. This is primarily
because Mamba is a sequence model without attention mechanisms, whereas most
token reduction techniques for ViTs rely on attention mechanisms for importance
measurement and overlook the order of compressed tokens. In this paper, we
investigate a Mamba structure-aware importance score to evaluate token
importance in a simple and effective manner. Building on this score, we further
propose MTR, a training-free \textbf{M}amba \textbf{T}oken \textbf{R}eduction
framework. Without the need for training or additional tuning parameters, our
method can be seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play component across various
Mamba models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly
reduces computational workload while minimizing performance impact across
various tasks and multiple backbones. Notably, MTR reduces FLOPs by
approximately 40\% on the Vim-B backbone, with only a 1.6\% drop in ImageNet
performance without retraining.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to learn new classes over time without
forgetting previously acquired knowledge. The emergence of foundation models
(FM) pretrained on large datasets presents new opportunities for CIL by
offering rich, transferable representations. However, their potential for
enabling incremental learning in dermatology remains largely unexplored. In
this paper, we systematically evaluate frozen FMs pretrained on large-scale
skin lesion datasets for CIL in dermatological disease classification. We
propose a simple yet effective approach where the backbone remains frozen, and
a lightweight MLP is trained incrementally for each task. This setup achieves
state-of-the-art performance without forgetting, outperforming regularization,
replay, and architecture based methods. To further explore the capabilities of
frozen FMs, we examine zero training scenarios using nearest mean classifiers
with prototypes derived from their embeddings. Through extensive ablation
studies, we demonstrate that this prototype based variant can also achieve
competitive results. Our findings highlight the strength of frozen FMs for
continual learning in dermatology and support their broader adoption in real
world medical applications. Our code and datasets are available here.

TL;DR: VLA-Mark是一种视觉对齐的水印框架，通过跨模态协调嵌入可检测水印，同时保持语义保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本水印方法因偏置标记选择和静态策略破坏了视觉-文本对齐，VLA-Mark旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合多尺度视觉-文本对齐指标（局部补丁亲和性、全局语义一致性和上下文注意力模式），动态平衡水印强度和语义保留。

Result: 实验显示，VLA-Mark在PPL和BLEU上优于传统方法，检测准确率达98.8%，抗攻击能力达96.1%。

Conclusion: VLA-Mark为质量保持的多模态水印设定了新标准。

Abstract: Vision-language models demand watermarking solutions that protect
intellectual property without compromising multimodal coherence. Existing text
watermarking methods disrupt visual-textual alignment through biased token
selection and static strategies, leaving semantic-critical concepts vulnerable.
We propose VLA-Mark, a vision-aligned framework that embeds detectable
watermarks while preserving semantic fidelity through cross-modal coordination.
Our approach integrates multiscale visual-textual alignment metrics, combining
localized patch affinity, global semantic coherence, and contextual attention
patterns, to guide watermark injection without model retraining. An
entropy-sensitive mechanism dynamically balances watermark strength and
semantic preservation, prioritizing visual grounding during low-uncertainty
generation phases. Experiments show 7.4% lower PPL and 26.6% higher BLEU than
conventional methods, with near-perfect detection (98.8% AUC). The framework
demonstrates 96.1\% attack resilience against attacks such as paraphrasing and
synonym substitution, while maintaining text-visual consistency, establishing
new standards for quality-preserving multimodal watermarking

TL;DR: 论文分析了四种匿名化技术对异常检测性能的影响，发现某些技术下模型性能反而提升，揭示了隐私保护与检测效用的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在监控视频异常检测中取得进展，但收集敏感数据引发隐私问题，需研究匿名化技术对检测性能的影响。

Method: 在UCF-Crime数据集上应用模糊、遮罩、加密和虚拟替换四种匿名化技术，评估四种异常检测方法的性能。

Result: 实验表明匿名化数据下异常检测仍可行，某些匿名化模式（如加密和遮罩）下模型性能甚至提升。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了算法对匿名化的敏感性，强调隐私保护与检测效用的权衡，为隐私与检测需求的平衡提供了基准。

Abstract: Advancements in deep learning have improved anomaly detection in surveillance
videos, yet they raise urgent privacy concerns due to the collection of
sensitive human data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of
anomaly detection performance under four human anonymization techniques,
including blurring, masking, encryption, and avatar replacement, applied to the
UCF-Crime dataset. We evaluate four anomaly detection methods, MGFN, UR-DMU,
BN-WVAD, and PEL4VAD, on the anonymized UCF-Crime to reveal how each method
responds to different obfuscation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate
that anomaly detection remains viable under anonymized data and is dependent on
the algorithmic design and the learning strategy. For instance, under certain
anonymization patterns, such as encryption and masking, some models
inadvertently achieve higher AUC performance compared to raw data, due to the
strong responsiveness of their algorithmic components to these noise patterns.
These results highlight the algorithm-specific sensitivities to anonymization
and emphasize the trade-off between preserving privacy and maintaining
detection utility. Furthermore, we compare these conventional anonymization
techniques with the emerging privacy-by-design solutions, highlighting an often
overlooked trade-off between robust privacy protection and utility flexibility.
Through comprehensive experiments and analyses, this study provides a
compelling benchmark and insights into balancing human privacy with the demands
of anomaly detection.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于深度学习的自动化软件（Carebot AI Bones）用于测量脊柱侧弯的Cobb角，在多中心评估中表现出与放射科医生相近的准确性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脊柱侧弯影响2-4%的青少年，传统手动测量Cobb角耗时且存在观察者间差异。研究旨在验证自动化软件的准确性和临床实用性。

Method: 研究回顾性评估了103张全脊柱X光片，由两位放射科医生独立测量作为参考，通过Bland-Altman分析、MAE、RMSE、Pearson相关系数和Cohen kappa评估AI与医生的一致性。

Result: AI与两位医生的MAE分别为3.89度和3.90度，Pearson相关系数分别为0.906和0.880，Cohen kappa为0.51和0.64，表明AI测量与专家水平一致。

Conclusion: 该软件在多中心验证中表现出与专家相当的测量能力，可用于优化脊柱侧弯的临床工作流程。

Abstract: Scoliosis affects roughly 2 to 4 percent of adolescents, and treatment
decisions depend on precise Cobb angle measurement. Manual assessment is time
consuming and subject to inter observer variation. We conducted a
retrospective, multi centre evaluation of a fully automated deep learning
software (Carebot AI Bones, Spine Measurement functionality; Carebot s.r.o.) on
103 standing anteroposterior whole spine radiographs collected from ten
hospitals. Two musculoskeletal radiologists independently measured each study
and served as reference readers. Agreement between the AI and each radiologist
was assessed with Bland Altman analysis, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean
squared error (RMSE), Pearson correlation coefficient, and Cohen kappa for four
grade severity classification. Against Radiologist 1 the AI achieved an MAE of
3.89 degrees (RMSE 4.77 degrees) with a bias of 0.70 degrees and limits of
agreement from minus 8.59 to plus 9.99 degrees. Against Radiologist 2 the AI
achieved an MAE of 3.90 degrees (RMSE 5.68 degrees) with a bias of 2.14 degrees
and limits from minus 8.23 to plus 12.50 degrees. Pearson correlations were r
equals 0.906 and r equals 0.880 (inter reader r equals 0.928), while Cohen
kappa for severity grading reached 0.51 and 0.64 (inter reader kappa 0.59).
These results demonstrate that the proposed software reproduces expert level
Cobb angle measurements and categorical grading across multiple centres,
suggesting its utility for streamlining scoliosis reporting and triage in
clinical workflows.

TL;DR: C-DOG是一种无需训练的多视角多目标关联框架，通过结合图模型和极几何，在噪声和视觉不可区分的情况下实现鲁棒关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖外观特征或几何约束，但在目标视觉不可区分或噪声干扰时效果不佳。

Method: C-DOG结合连接delta-overlap图模型和极几何，通过聚类和IQR过滤提升鲁棒性。

Result: 在合成基准测试中，C-DOG优于几何基线，并在高目标密度等挑战下表现稳健。

Conclusion: C-DOG适用于现实场景中可扩展的3D重建，无需视觉特征且对相机重叠要求低。

Abstract: Multi-view multi-object association is a fundamental step in 3D
reconstruction pipelines, enabling consistent grouping of object instances
across multiple camera views. Existing methods often rely on appearance
features or geometric constraints such as epipolar consistency. However, these
approaches can fail when objects are visually indistinguishable or observations
are corrupted by noise. We propose C-DOG, a training-free framework that serves
as an intermediate module bridging object detection (or pose estimation) and 3D
reconstruction, without relying on visual features. It combines connected
delta-overlap graph modeling with epipolar geometry to robustly associate
detections across views. Each 2D observation is represented as a graph node,
with edges weighted by epipolar consistency. A delta-neighbor-overlap
clustering step identifies strongly consistent groups while tolerating noise
and partial connectivity. To further improve robustness, we incorporate
Interquartile Range (IQR)-based filtering and a 3D back-projection error
criterion to eliminate inconsistent observations. Extensive experiments on
synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that C-DOG outperforms geometry-based
baselines and remains robust under challenging conditions, including high
object density, without visual features, and limited camera overlap, making it
well-suited for scalable 3D reconstruction in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: Franca为透明、高性能视觉模型设定了新标准，推动了可复现和通用基础模型的发展。

Abstract: We present Franca (pronounced Fran-ka): free one; the first fully open-source
(data, code, weights) vision foundation model that matches and in many cases
surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art proprietary models, e.g., DINOv2,
CLIP, SigLIPv2, etc. Our approach is grounded in a transparent training
pipeline inspired by Web-SSL and uses publicly available data: ImageNet-21K and
a subset of ReLAION-2B. Beyond model release, we tackle critical limitations in
SSL clustering methods. While modern models rely on assigning image features to
large codebooks via clustering algorithms like Sinkhorn-Knopp, they fail to
account for the inherent ambiguity in clustering semantics. To address this, we
introduce a parameter-efficient, multi-head clustering projector based on
nested Matryoshka representations. This design progressively refines features
into increasingly fine-grained clusters without increasing the model size,
enabling both performance and memory efficiency. Additionally, we propose a
novel positional disentanglement strategy that explicitly removes positional
biases from dense representations, thereby improving the encoding of semantic
content. This leads to consistent gains on several downstream benchmarks,
demonstrating the utility of cleaner feature spaces. Our contributions
establish a new standard for transparent, high-performance vision models and
open a path toward more reproducible and generalizable foundation models for
the broader AI community. The code and model checkpoints are available at
https://github.com/valeoai/Franca.
