For most of these tasks, performance can be measured with\nobjective metrics, such as the number of correct answers. However, other\nlanguage features are not easily quantified. For example, arousal,\nconcreteness, or gender associated with a given word, as well as the extent to\nwhich we experience words with senses and relate them to a specific sense.\nThose features have been studied for many years by psycholinguistics,\nconducting large-scale experiments with humans to produce ratings for thousands\nof words. This opens an opportunity to evaluate how well LLMs align with human\nratings on these word features, taking advantage of existing studies that cover\nmany different language features in a large number of words. In this paper, we\nevaluate the alignment of a representative group of LLMs with human ratings on\ntwo psycholinguistic datasets: the Glasgow and Lancaster norms. These datasets\ncover thirteen features over thousands of words. The results show that\nalignment is \\textcolor{black}{generally} better in the Glasgow norms evaluated\n(arousal, valence, dominance, concreteness, imageability, familiarity, and\ngender) than on the Lancaster norms evaluated (introceptive, gustatory,\nolfactory, haptic, auditory, and visual). This suggests a potential limitation\nof current LLMs in aligning with human sensory associations for words, which\nmay be due to their lack of embodied cognition present in humans and\nillustrates the usefulness of evaluating LLMs with psycholinguistic datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u5fc3\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08Glasgow\u548cLancaster\u89c4\u8303\uff09\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5355\u8bcd\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u5728Glasgow\u89c4\u8303\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eLancaster\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u611f\u5b98\u5173\u8054\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u96be\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u611f\u5b98\u5173\u8054\uff09\u3002\u672c\u6587\u5229\u7528\u5fc3\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8LLMs\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Glasgow\u548cLancaster\u89c4\u8303\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u572813\u4e2a\u5355\u8bcd\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u5728Glasgow\u89c4\u8303\uff08\u5982\u60c5\u611f\u3001\u719f\u6089\u5ea6\u7b49\uff09\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728Lancaster\u89c4\u8303\uff08\u5982\u611f\u5b98\u7279\u5f81\uff09\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u611f\u5b98\u5173\u8054\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5728\u611f\u5b98\u5173\u8054\u65b9\u9762\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5177\u8eab\u8ba4\u77e5\u3002\u5fc3\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3aLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

However,\ntraditional feature detectors such as SIFT and SURF, which rely on\nGaussian-based scale spaces, tend to suppress high-frequency edges, making them\nunsuitable for thin crack localization. Lightweight binary alternatives like\nORB and BRISK, while computationally efficient, often suffer from poor keypoint\nrepeatability on textured or shadowed surfaces. This study presents a\nphysics-informed alignment framework that adapts the open KAZE architecture to\nSHM-specific challenges. By utilizing nonlinear anisotropic diffusion to\nconstruct a crack-preserving scale space, and integrating RANSAC-based\nhomography estimation, the framework enables accurate geometric correction\nwithout the need for training, parameter tuning, or prior calibration. The\nmethod is validated on time-lapse images of masonry and concrete acquired via\nhandheld smartphone under varied field conditions, including shadow\ninterference, cropping, oblique viewing angles, and surface clutter.

A common limitation in\nexisting vision-based automatic pest counting research is that models are\ntypically evaluated on datasets with ground truth but deployed in real-world\nscenarios without assessing the reliability of counting results due to the lack\nof ground truth. To this end, this paper proposed a method for comprehensively\nevaluating pest counting confidence in the image, based on information related\nto counting results and external environmental conditions. First, a pest\ndetection network is used for pest detection and counting, extracting counting\nresult-related information. Then, the pest images undergo image quality\nassessment, image complexity assessment, and pest distribution uniformity\nassessment. And the changes in image clarity caused by stirring during image\nacquisition are quantified by calculating the average gradient magnitude.\nNotably, we designed a hypothesis-driven multi-factor sensitivity analysis\nmethod to select the optimal image quality assessment and image complexity\nassessment methods. And we proposed an adaptive DBSCAN clustering algorithm for\npest distribution uniformity assessment. Finally, the obtained information\nrelated to counting results and external environmental conditions is input into\na regression model for prediction, resulting in the final pest counting\nconfidence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study dedicated to\ncomprehensively evaluating counting confidence in counting tasks, and\nquantifying the relationship between influencing factors and counting\nconfidence through a model.

We further evaluate the impact of subscribers,\nview counts, and automatically versus human-created labels on performance, and\nhighlight both the potential and challenges of weak supervision in this domain.\nThis work provides a reproducible benchmark and open dataset for future\nresearch on misinformation detection in German-language Telegram networks and\nother low-moderation social platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86Misinfo-TeleGraph\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u5fb7\u8bedTelegram\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b500\u4e07\u6761\u6d88\u606f\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GNNs\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0GraphSAGE\u7ed3\u5408LSTM\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "Telegram\u7b49\u4f4e\u76d1\u7ba1\u5e73\u53f0\u6210\u4e3a\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u6e20\u9053\uff0c\u4f46\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\u548c\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u4fe1\u606f\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5fb7\u8bedTelegram\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5143\u6570\u636e\u3001\u9891\u9053\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u5f3a\u5f31\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u548cGNNs\uff08\u5982GraphSAGE\uff09\u3002", "result": "GraphSAGE\u7ed3\u5408LSTM\u5728MCC\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5fb7\u8bedTelegram\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u4e0e\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose\na method for training a masking network to perform binary object segmentation\nusing weak supervision in the form of image-wise presence or absence of an\nobject of interest, which provides less information but may be obtained more\nquickly from manual or automatic labeling. A key step in our method is that the\nsegmented objects can be placed into background-only images to create\nrealistic, images of the objects with counterfactual backgrounds. To create a\ncontrast between the original and counterfactual background images, we propose\nto first cluster the background-only images, and then during learning create\ncounterfactual images that blend objects segmented from their original source\nbackgrounds to backgrounds chosen from a targeted cluster. One term in the\ntraining loss is the divergence between these counterfactual images and the\nreal object images with backgrounds of the target cluster. The other term is a\nsupervised loss for background-only images. While an adversarial critic could\nprovide the divergence, we use sample-based divergences.

A\ndrafter-based speculative decoding leverages one or more smaller language\nmodels, a.k.a. drafters or draft models, to sample a draft sequence or tree\nconsisting of multiple tokens, followed by verification by a base LLM, a target\nmodel, accepting a subset as its valid generation. As it is usually considered\nthat the speculative decoding requires one-to-one mapping between vocabularies\nof the target model and the draft model, it has been natural to share the\nvocabulary between them, or even share the LM head as in EAGLE or Medusa. We\nfirst identify that this draft token sampling scheme inherently contains an\nunnecessary inference overhead in drafting, especially for some target LLMs\nwith very large vocabularies. Then, we propose a simple technique, VocabTrim,\nto mitigate the drafting overhead to improve the generation speed in\nmemory-bound environment. VocabTrim reconstructs the drafter LM head to contain\nonly a limited set of tokens, selected by the most frequently sampled from the\nvocabulary of the target model. While limiting the vocabulary in drafting\nslightly degrades the acceptance rate, it significantly reduces the drafting\nlatency in memory-bound process which is often the case on edge devices,\nresulting in higher memory-bound speed up (MBSU).

Recently, with the development of Diffusion-based Dense Prediction\n(DDP) models, the exploration of DA designs tailored to this framework is worth\nexploring, since the diffusion model is effective in modeling the distribution\ntransformation that comprises domain information. In this work, we propose a\ntraining-free mechanism for DDP frameworks, endowing them with DA capabilities.\nOur motivation arises from the observation that the exposure bias (e.g., noise\nstatistics bias) in diffusion brings domain shift, and different domains in\nconditions of DDP models can also be effectively captured by the noise\nprediction statistics. Based on this, we propose a training-free Domain Noise\nAlignment (DNA) approach, which alleviates the variations of noise statistics\nto domain changes during the diffusion sampling process, thereby achieving\ndomain adaptation. Specifically, when the source domain is available, we\ndirectly adopt the DNA method to achieve domain adaptation by aligning the\nnoise statistics of the target domain with those of the source domain. For the\nmore challenging source-free DA, inspired by the observation that regions\ncloser to the source domain exhibit higher confidence meeting variations of\nsampling noise, we utilize the statistics from the high-confidence regions\nprogressively to guide the noise statistic adjustment during the sampling\nprocess. Notably, our method demonstrates the effectiveness of enhancing the DA\ncapability of DDP models across four common dense prediction tasks.

This study pioneers the use of generative\ndiffusion models to address this limitation. Based on the multi-band thermal\ninfrared brightness temperature data from the Advanced Geostationary Radiation\nImager (AGRI) onboard the Fengyun-4B (FY4B) geostationary satellite, we\ndeveloped a high-precision visible light reflectance retrieval model, called\nReflectance Diffusion (RefDiff), which enables 0.47~\\mu\\mathrm{m},\n0.65~\\mu\\mathrm{m}, and 0.825~\\mu\\mathrm{m} bands visible light reflectance\nretrieval at night. Compared to the classical models, RefDiff not only\nsignificantly improves accuracy through ensemble averaging but also provides\nuncertainty estimation.

To evaluate VFT, we subsequently\ntrain models with RL on environments where held-out prompt cues signal which\nincorrect answers will receive high reward, incentivizing models to reward hack\nby exploiting cues instead of reasoning correctly. We measure how often models\nexploit these cues without verbalizing it. After RL, only 6% of the VFT-trained\nmodel's responses consist of undetected reward hacks.

This eliminates the need to sample the space of all\npossible boxes that constrains conventional detectors and thus solves the dual\nproblems of loss sparsity during training and heuristics-based postprocessing\nduring inference. Second, it conceptualizes and outputs the video objects as\nfully integrated and indivisible 3D boxes or tracklets instead of generating\nimage-specific 2D boxes and linking these boxes together to construct the video\nobject, as done in most conventional detectors. This allows it to scale\neffortlessly with available computational resources by simply increasing the\nlength of the video subsequence that the network takes as input, even\ngeneralizing to multi-object tracking if the subsequence can span the entire\nvideo. We compare our video detector with the baseline Pix2Seq static detector\non several datasets and demonstrate consistent improvement, although with\nstrong signs of being bottlenecked by our limited computational resources.

Our\ntwo-stage training pipeline first performs CLIP-style pretraining on over 2.9\nmillion biomedical image-text pairs from 26 image modalities, followed by\nfeature-level distillation using over 19.2 million feature pairs extracted from\nteacher models. We evaluate MMKD-CLIP on 58 diverse biomedical datasets,\nencompassing over 10.8 million biomedical images across nine image modalities.\nThe evaluation spans six core task types: zero-shot classification, linear\nprobing, cross-modal retrieval, visual question answering, survival prediction,\nand cancer diagnosis. MMKD-CLIP consistently outperforms all teacher models\nwhile demonstrating remarkable robustness and generalization across image\ndomains and task settings. These results underscore that multi-teacher\nknowledge distillation is a scalable and effective paradigm for building\nhigh-performing biomedical foundation models under the practical constraints of\nreal-world data availability.", "AI": {"tldr": "MMKD-CLIP\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6559\u5e08\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u4e0d\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1a1) \u5728290\u4e07\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b2) \u4ece9\u4e2a\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d61920\u4e07\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u7ea7\u84b8\u998f\u3002", "result": "\u572858\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6db5\u76d61080\u4e07\u56fe\u50cf\u548c9\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\uff0cMMKD-CLIP\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6559\u5e08\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We\npropose the SoMi-ToM benchmark, designed to evaluate multi-perspective ToM in\nembodied multi-agent complex social interactions. This benchmark is based on\nrich multimodal interaction data generated by the interaction environment SoMi,\ncovering diverse crafting goals and social relationships. Our framework\nsupports multi-level evaluation: (1) first-person evaluation provides\nmultimodal (visual, dialogue, action, etc.) input from a first-person\nperspective during a task for real-time state inference, (2) third-person\nevaluation provides complete third-person perspective video and text records\nafter a task for goal and behavior inference. This evaluation method allows for\na more comprehensive examination of a model's ToM capabilities from both the\nsubjective immediate experience and the objective global observation. We\nconstructed a challenging dataset containing 35 third-person perspective\nvideos, 363 first-person perspective images, and 1225 expert-annotated\nmultiple-choice questions (three options).

In this paper, we present a method to solve\nthese two problems jointly from a sequence of observed point clouds of a single\narticulated object. The main challenge in our problem setting is that the point\nclouds are not assumed to be generated by a fixed set of moving points.\nInstead, each point cloud in the sequence could be an arbitrary sampling of the\nobject surface at that particular time step. Such scenarios occur when the\nobject undergoes major occlusions, or if the dataset is collected using\nmeasurements from multiple sensors asynchronously. In these scenarios, methods\nthat rely on tracking point correspondences are not appropriate. We present an\nalternative approach based on a compact but effective representation where we\nrepresent the object as a collection of simple building blocks modeled as 3D\nGaussians. We parameterize the Gaussians with time-dependent rotations,\ntranslations, and scales that are shared across all time steps. With our\nrepresentation, part segmentation can be achieved by building correspondences\nbetween the observed points and the Gaussians. Moreover, the transformation of\neach point across time can be obtained by following the poses of the assigned\nGaussian (even when the point is not observed). Experiments show that our\nmethod outperforms existing methods that solely rely on finding point\ncorrespondences. Additionally, we extend existing datasets to emulate\nreal-world scenarios by considering viewpoint occlusions. We further\ndemonstrate that our method is more robust to missing points as compared to\nexisting approaches on these challenging datasets, even when some parts are\ncompletely occluded in some time-steps.

To\ngenerate large-scale and denser colored point clouds, we propose a deep\nlearning-based Joint Geometry and Attribute Up-sampling (JGAU) method that\nlearns to model both geometry and attribute patterns while leveraging spatial\nattribute correlations. First, we establish and release a large-scale dataset\nfor colored point cloud up-sampling called SYSU-PCUD, containing 121\nlarge-scale colored point clouds with diverse geometry and attribute\ncomplexities across six categories and four sampling rates. Second, to improve\nthe quality of up-sampled point clouds, we propose a deep learning-based JGAU\nframework that jointly up-samples geometry and attributes. It consists of a\ngeometry up-sampling network and an attribute up-sampling network, where the\nlatter leverages the up-sampled auxiliary geometry to model neighborhood\ncorrelations of the attributes. Third, we propose two coarse attribute\nup-sampling methods, Geometric Distance Weighted Attribute Interpolation\n(GDWAI) and Deep Learning-based Attribute Interpolation (DLAI), to generate\ncoarse up-sampled attributes for each point. Then, an attribute enhancement\nmodule is introduced to refine these up-sampled attributes and produce\nhigh-quality point clouds by further exploiting intrinsic attribute and\ngeometry patterns.

Built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), RoboPearls enables the\nconstruction of photo-realistic, view-consistent simulations from demonstration\nvideos, and supports a wide range of simulation operators, including various\nobject manipulations, powered by advanced modules like Incremental Semantic\nDistillation (ISD) and 3D regularized NNFM Loss (3D-NNFM). Moreover, by\nincorporating large language models (LLMs), RoboPearls automates the simulation\nproduction process in a user-friendly manner through flexible command\ninterpretation and execution. Furthermore, RoboPearls employs a vision-language\nmodel (VLM) to analyze robotic learning issues to close the simulation loop for\nperformance enhancement. To demonstrate the effectiveness of RoboPearls, we\nconduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets and scenes, including\nRLBench, COLOSSEUM, Ego4D, Open X-Embodiment, and a real-world robot, which\ndemonstrate our satisfactory simulation performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "RoboPearls\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6563\u5c04\u7684\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u89c6\u9891\u4eff\u771f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6f14\u793a\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u75283D\u9ad8\u65af\u6563\u5c04\u6784\u5efa\u903c\u771f\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u589e\u91cf\u8bed\u4e49\u84b8\u998f\u548c3D\u6b63\u5219\u5316NNFM\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4eff\u771f\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86RoboPearls\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6ee1\u610f\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "RoboPearls\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

This separate\nencoding fails to bridge the modality gap effectively, and more critically,\nthese methods struggle with the sparsity and noise of single-frame LiDAR, often\nrequiring point cloud accumulation or additional priors to improve reliability.\nInspired by recent progress in detector-free matching paradigms (e.g.\nMatchAnything), we revisit the projection-based approach and introduce the\ndetector-free framework for direct point-pixel matching between LiDAR and\ncamera views.

Furthermore, we introduce\nV-Synthesis, which leverages V-Score for proportional sampling to ensure both\nhigh consistency and diversity of synthesized demonstrations.

Curiously, we find that the retokenizer can filter\nnatural language patterns from noise, generating synthetic languages with\ncoherent internal morphology -- quantifiably the same as human language.\nLanguage is learned in a local (Hebbian) fashion, where model constraints\ndictate allowed emergent structure, and new information is retained in\nalignment with this structure.

Our network\ncomprises two key modules: the Geometry module, which generates semantic\nradiance and occupancy fields, and the Appearance module, which is responsible\nfor predicting RGB radiance. We jointly train both modules in adversarial\nsettings to learn semantic-aware geometry and appearance descriptors. The\nappearance descriptors are then conditioned on their respective semantic latent\ncodes by the Appearance Module, facilitating disentanglement and enhanced\ncontrol.

However, in CP, an ego agent needs\nto receive messages from its collaborators, which makes it vulnerable to\nattacks from malicious agents. To address this critical issue, we propose a\nunified, probability-agnostic, and adaptive framework, namely, CP-Guard, which\nis a tailored defense mechanism for CP deployed by each agent to accurately\ndetect and eliminate malicious agents in its collaboration network. Our key\nidea is to enable CP to reach a consensus rather than a conflict against an ego\nagent's perception results. Based on this idea, we first develop a\nprobability-agnostic sample consensus (PASAC) method to effectively sample a\nsubset of the collaborators and verify the consensus without prior\nprobabilities of malicious agents. Furthermore, we define collaborative\nconsistency loss (CCLoss) for object detection task and bird's eye view (BEV)\nsegmentation task to capture the discrepancy between an ego agent and its\ncollaborators, which is used as a verification criterion for consensus.

NCAs display striking emergent behaviors including\nself-regeneration, generalization and robustness to unseen situations, and\nspontaneous motion. Despite their success in texture synthesis and\nmorphogenesis, NCAs remain largely confined to low-resolution grids. This\nlimitation stems from (1) training time and memory requirements that grow\nquadratically with grid size, (2) the strictly local propagation of information\nwhich impedes long-range cell communication, and (3) the heavy compute demands\nof real-time inference at high resolution. In this work, we overcome this\nlimitation by pairing NCA with a tiny, shared implicit decoder, inspired by\nrecent advances in implicit neural representations. Following NCA evolution on\na coarse grid, a lightweight decoder renders output images at arbitrary\nresolution. We also propose novel loss functions for both morphogenesis and\ntexture synthesis tasks, specifically tailored for high-resolution output with\nminimal memory and computation overhead. Combining our proposed architecture\nand loss functions brings substantial improvement in quality, efficiency, and\nperformance. NCAs equipped with our implicit decoder can generate full-HD\noutputs in real time while preserving their self-organizing, emergent\nproperties.

In VPT, we uncover\n``burstiness'' in the values arising from the interaction of image patch\nembeddings, and the key and query projectors within Transformer's\nself-attention module. Furthermore, the values of patch embeddings and the key\nand query projectors exhibit Laplacian and hyper-Laplacian distribution,\nrespectively. Intuitively, these non-Gaussian distributions pose challenges for\nlearning prompts. To address this, we propose whitening these data,\nde-correlating them and equalizing their variance towards more Gaussian before\nlearning prompts. We derive the whitening matrix over random image patch\nembeddings and ViT's key and query projectors, and multiply it with the prompt\nto be learned in a bilinear manner.

These findings challenge the validity\nof current benchmark-based claims about reasoning in LLMs, and highlight the\nneed for evaluation protocols that assess reasoning as a process of drawing\ninference from available information, rather than as static output selection.\nWe release audited data and evaluation tools to support more interpretable and\ndiagnostic assessments of model reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5bf9\u4e09\u4e2a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\uff08SocialIQa\u3001FauxPas-EAI\u3001ToMi\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5ba1\u8ba1\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u666e\u904d\u7f3a\u9677\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u4e94\u79cdLLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u8bed\u7528\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u8bc4\u5206\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5173\u6ce8\u8f93\u51fa\u5f62\u5f0f\u800c\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u5fae\u5c0f\u53d8\u5316\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u9ad8\u5206\u53ef\u80fd\u6e90\u4e8e\u683c\u5f0f\u5bf9\u9f50\u800c\u975e\u771f\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u5b58\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9LLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8bef\u5224\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e94\u79cdLLM\uff08GPT-3\u30013.5\u30014\u3001o1\u548cLLaMA 3.1\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6e05\u7406\u540e\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u51c6\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u91cd\u590d\u9879\u3001\u6a21\u7cca\u8868\u8ff0\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u4fe1\u7b54\u6848\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u5fae\u5c0f\u53d8\u5316\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u9ad8\u5206\u53ef\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u683c\u5f0f\u5bf9\u9f50\u800c\u975e\u771f\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u7684LLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u6ce8\u91cd\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u900f\u660e\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

Existing training paradigms,\nincluding Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with\nVerifiable Reward (RLVR), impose substantial demands on the base VLM, exceeding\nthe capabilities of SVLMs. Consequently, directly applying these paradigms to\nSVLMs often suffers from severe pseudo thinking traces and advantage collapse,\nultimately undermining both thinking reliability and task performance. A\nnatural solution is to combine SFT and RLVR, leveraging their complementarity\nto reduce the dependence on model capacity. However, the widely adopted\ntwo-stage training paradigm still performs poorly on SVLMs, as their tendency\ntoward sub-optimal convergence hinders the trade-off and limits the benefits of\nthe combination. To address this, we propose DyME, a novel training paradigm\nthat Dynamically selects between Memorization (via SFT) and Exploration (via\nRLVR) modes at each optimization step, ensuring that every update contributes\nto the trade-off. Extensive experiments across diverse domains demonstrate that\nDyME consistently achieves this balance, and thus delivers substantial\nperformance improvements. These results establish DyME as a practical and\neffective solution for empowering SVLMs with reliable thinking capabilities.\nGitHub: https://github.com/HKUST-LongGroup/DyME", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faDyME\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff08SFT\uff09\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\uff08RLVR\uff09\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SVLMs\uff09\u56e0\u53c2\u6570\u5bb9\u91cf\u6709\u9650\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u601d\u7ef4\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff08SFT\u548cRLVR\uff09\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8981\u6c42\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f2a\u601d\u7ef4\u75d5\u8ff9\u548c\u4f18\u52bf\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDyME\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff08SFT\uff09\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\uff08RLVR\uff09\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6bcf\u6b21\u4f18\u5316\u66f4\u65b0\u5747\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eDyME\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "DyME\u662f\u63d0\u5347SVLMs\u601d\u7ef4\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

A Scoping Review from a Mathematics Education Perspective", "comment": null, "summary": "The progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT raises the question\nof how they can be integrated into education. One hope is that they can support\nmathematics learning, including word-problem solving. Since LLMs can handle\ntextual input with ease, they appear well-suited for solving mathematical word\nproblems. Yet their real competence, whether they can make sense of the\nreal-world context, and the implications for classrooms remain unclear. We\nconducted a scoping review from a mathematics-education perspective, including\nthree parts: a technical overview, a systematic review of word problems used in\nresearch, and a state-of-the-art empirical evaluation of LLMs on mathematical\nword problems. First, in the technical overview, we contrast the\nconceptualization of word problems and their solution processes between LLMs\nand students. In computer-science research this is typically labeled\nmathematical reasoning, a term that does not align with usage in mathematics\neducation. Second, our literature review of 213 studies shows that the most\npopular word-problem corpora are dominated by s-problems, which do not require\na consideration of realities of their real-world context. Finally, our\nevaluation of GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1, and o3 on 287 word problems\nshows that most recent LLMs solve these s-problems with near-perfect accuracy,\nincluding a perfect score on 20 problems from PISA. LLMs still showed\nweaknesses in tackling problems where the real-world context is problematic or\nnon-sensical. In sum, we argue based on all three aspects that LLMs have\nmastered a superficial solution process but do not make sense of word problems,\nwhich potentially limits their value as instructional tools in mathematics\nclassrooms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u7b80\u5355\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u60c5\u5883\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76LLMs\u5982\u4f55\u652f\u6301\u6570\u5b66\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u9898\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u8bfe\u5802\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6280\u672f\u6982\u8ff0\u3001\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5206\u6790LLMs\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u7b80\u5355\u5e94\u7528\u9898\uff08s-problems\uff09\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5904\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u60c5\u5883\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u4ecd\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u867d\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u8868\u9762\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5e94\u7528\u9898\u60c5\u5883\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u6559\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Due to the limitations\nof current imaging techniques and the complexity of spinal structures, existing\nmethods still struggle with reducing the impact of image blurring and\ndistinguishing similar vertebrae. To alleviate these issues, we introduce a\nFrequency-enhanced Multi-granularity Context Network (FMC-Net) to improve the\naccuracy of vertebrae segmentation. Specifically, we first apply wavelet\ntransform for lossless downsampling to reduce the feature distortion in blurred\nimages. The decomposed high and low-frequency components are then processed\nseparately. For the high-frequency components, we apply a High-frequency\nFeature Refinement (HFR) to amplify the prominence of key features and filter\nout noises, restoring fine-grained details in blurred images. For the\nlow-frequency components, we use a Multi-granularity State Space Model (MG-SSM)\nto aggregate feature representations with different receptive fields,\nextracting spatially-varying contexts while capturing long-range dependencies\nwith linear complexity. The utilization of multi-granularity contexts is\nessential for distinguishing similar vertebrae and improving segmentation\naccuracy.

To enable\nsuch models with high-fidelity human motion, two core challenges must be\naddressed. The first is the reconstruction gap between the continuous motion\nmodality and discrete representation in an autoregressive manner, and the\nsecond is the degradation of language intelligence during unified training.\nInspired by the mixture of experts, we propose MotionGPT3, a bimodal\nmotion-language model that treats human motion as a second modality, decoupling\nmotion modeling via separate model parameters and enabling both effective\ncross-modal interaction and efficient multimodal scaling training. To preserve\nlanguage intelligence, the text branch retains the original structure and\nparameters of the pretrained language model, while a new motion branch is\nintegrated via a shared attention mechanism, enabling bidirectional information\nflow between two modalities.

However, these methods rely heavily on sufficient motion\nparallax in the input images or videos. When the camera motion range becomes\nlimited or even stationary (i.e., small camera motion), existing methods\nencounter two primary challenges: incorrect representation of scene geometry\nand inaccurate estimation of camera parameters. These challenges make prior\nmethods struggle to produce satisfactory results or even become invalid. To\naddress the first challenge, we propose a novel Distribution-based Depth\nRegularization (DDR) that ensures the rendering weight distribution to align\nwith the true distribution. Specifically, unlike previous methods that use\ndepth loss to calculate the error of the expectation, we calculate the\nexpectation of the error by using Gumbel-softmax to differentiably sample\npoints from discrete rendering weight distribution. Additionally, we introduce\nconstraints that enforce the volume density of spatial points before the object\nboundary along the ray to be near zero, ensuring that our model learns the\ncorrect geometry of the scene. To demystify the DDR, we further propose a\nvisualization tool that enables observing the scene geometry representation at\nthe rendering weight level. For the second challenge, we incorporate camera\nparameter learning during training to enhance the robustness of our model to\ncamera parameters.

Typically, existing methods adopt unified\nrepresentation model (e.g., Gaussian) to directly match the spatiotemporal\nfeatures of dynamic scene from frame camera. However, this unified paradigm\nfails in the potential discontinuous temporal features of objects due to frame\nimaging and the heterogeneous spatial features between background and objects.\nTo address this issue, we disentangle the spatiotemporal features into various\nlatent representations to alleviate the spatiotemporal mismatching between\nbackground and objects. In this work, we introduce event camera to compensate\nfor frame camera, and propose a spatiotemporal-disentangled Gaussian splatting\nframework for high-dynamic scene reconstruction. As for dynamic scene, we\nfigure out that background and objects have appearance discrepancy in\nframe-based spatial features and motion discrepancy in event-based temporal\nfeatures, which motivates us to distinguish the spatiotemporal features between\nbackground and objects via clustering. As for dynamic object, we discover that\nGaussian representations and event data share the consistent spatiotemporal\ncharacteristic, which could serve as a prior to guide the spatiotemporal\ndisentanglement of object Gaussians.

In response to\nthis challenge, we introduce \\textit{Trident}, a face forgery detection\nframework that employs triplet learning with a Siamese network architecture for\nenhanced adaptability across diverse forgery methods. \\textit{Trident} is\ntrained on curated triplets to isolate nuanced differences of forgeries,\ncapturing fine-grained features that distinguish pristine samples from\nmanipulated ones while controlling for other variables. To further enhance\ngeneralizability, we incorporate domain-adversarial training with a forgery\ndiscriminator.

However, the heavy\nreliance of existing systems on photometric rendering loss for camera tracking\nundermines their robustness, especially in unbounded outdoor environments with\nsevere viewpoint and illumination changes. To address these challenges, we\npropose TVG-SLAM, a robust RGB-only 3DGS SLAM system that leverages a novel\ntri-view geometry paradigm to ensure consistent tracking and high-quality\nmapping. We introduce a dense tri-view matching module that aggregates reliable\npairwise correspondences into consistent tri-view matches, forming robust\ngeometric constraints across frames. For tracking, we propose Hybrid Geometric\nConstraints, which leverage tri-view matches to construct complementary\ngeometric cues alongside photometric loss, ensuring accurate and stable pose\nestimation even under drastic viewpoint shifts and lighting variations. For\nmapping, we propose a new probabilistic initialization strategy that encodes\ngeometric uncertainty from tri-view correspondences into newly initialized\nGaussians. Additionally, we design a Dynamic Attenuation of Rendering Trust\nmechanism to mitigate tracking drift caused by mapping latency.

In this paper, a framework called PCLVis is\nproposed to help general users analyze process communication latency (PCL)\nevents. Instead of the physical link layer information, the PCLVis uses the MPI\nprocess communication data for the analysis. First, a spatial PCL event\nlocating method is developed. All processes with high correlation are\nclassified into a single cluster by constructing a process-correlation tree.\nSecond, the propagation path of PCL events is analyzed by constructing a\ncommunication-dependency-based directed acyclic graph (DAG), which can help\nusers interactively explore a PCL event from the temporal evolution of a\nlocated PCL event cluster. In this graph, a sliding window algorithm is\ndesigned to generate the PCL events abstraction. Meanwhile, a new glyph called\nthe communication state glyph (CS-Glyph) is designed for each process to show\nits communication states, including its in/out messages and load balance. Each\nleaf node can be further unfolded to view additional information. Third, a PCL\nevent attribution strategy is formulated to help users optimize their\nsimulations.

Despite their advancements, the explainability of MLLMs remains less\nexplored, hindering deeper understanding, model credibility, and effective\nvisualization. Unlike conventional vision models (e.g., CNNs, ViTs, CLIP) that\nproduce a single output, MLLMs generate sequences of tokens progressively,\nwhere each generated token depends on the previous context. Therefore, earlier\ncontext tokens can introduce redundant activations that interfere with the\nexplanation of later tokens beyond their original information. Existing studies\noften overlook this issue, but our observations reveal that these redundant\ncorrelations can significantly hurt the reliability of explanations. To address\nthis, we propose an estimated causal inference method to mitigate the\ninterference of context to achieve high-quality MLLM explanation, with a novel\nrank Gaussian filter to further reduce activation noises. We term this method\nToken Activation Map (TAM) to highlight the consideration of interactions\nbetween tokens.

Although existing deepfake detection\nmodels demonstrate outstanding performance in detection metrics, most methods\nonly provide simple binary classification results, lacking interpretability.

LE enables inference with more subjects by using the training\nsubjects to activate more frame embeddings. TAE encourages the generation\nprocess to extract guidance from temporally aligned control signals by\nassigning the same frame embeddings to the control and noise tokens.\nExperiments demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses\nstate-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.\nVideo demos are at our project page:\nhttps://caiyuanhao1998.github.io/project/OmniVCus/.

A prevalent issue in compositional generation is the misalignment\nof spatial relationships, as models often fail to faithfully generate images\nthat reflect the spatial configurations specified between objects in the input\nprompts. To address this challenge, we propose a novel probabilistic framework\nfor modeling the relative spatial positioning of objects in a scene, leveraging\nthe concept of Probability of Superiority (PoS).

Can we develop LiDAR world models that exhibit strong\ntransferability across multiple domains? We conduct the first systematic domain\ntransfer study across three demanding scenarios: (i) outdoor to indoor\ngeneralization, (ii) sparse-beam \\& dense-beam adaptation, and (iii)\nnon-semantic to semantic transfer. Given different amounts of fine-tuning data,\nour experiments show that a single pre-trained model can achieve up to 11%\nabsolute improvement (83\\% relative) over training from scratch and outperforms\ntraining from scratch in 30/36 of our comparisons. This transferability of\ndynamic learning significantly reduces the reliance on manually annotated data\nfor semantic occupancy forecasting: our method exceed the previous semantic\noccupancy forecasting models with only 5% of the labeled training data required\nby prior models. We also observed inefficiencies of current LiDAR world models,\nmainly through their under-compression of LiDAR data and inefficient training\nobjectives. To address this, we propose a latent conditional flow matching\n(CFM)-based frameworks that achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy\nusing only half the training data and a compression ratio 6 times higher than\nthat of prior methods.

However,\nlarge-scale datasets, specially those constructed from crowd-sourcing and\nweb-scraping, often suffer from label noise, inconsistencies, and errors. This\nproblem is particularly pronounced in manufacturing domains, where obtaining\nhigh-quality labels is costly and time-consuming. This paper introduces\nVision-Language Sanitization and Refinement (VLSR), which is a\nvision-language-based framework for label sanitization and refinement in\nmulti-label manufacturing image datasets. This method embeds both images and\ntheir associated textual labels into a shared semantic space leveraging the\nCLIP vision-language model. Then two key tasks are addressed in this process by\ncomputing the cosine similarity between embeddings. First, label sanitization\nis performed to identify irrelevant, misspelled, or semantically weak labels,\nand surface the most semantically aligned label for each image by comparing\nimage-label pairs using cosine similarity between image and label embeddings.\nSecond, the method applies density-based clustering on text embeddings,\nfollowed by iterative cluster merging, to group semantically similar labels\ninto unified label groups.

Due to image-level\nvisual-language alignment, CLIP falls short in understanding fine-grained\ndetails such as object attributes and spatial relationships between objects.\nRecent efforts have attempted to compel CLIP to acquire structured visual\nrepresentations by introducing prompt learning to achieve object-level\nalignment. While achieving promising results, they still lack the capability to\nperceive actions, which are crucial for describing the states or relationships\nbetween objects. Therefore, we propose to endow CLIP with fine-grained\naction-level understanding by introducing an LLM-enhanced action-aware\nmulti-modal prompt-tuning method, incorporating the action-related external\nknowledge generated by large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we design an\naction triplet prompt and an action state prompt to exploit compositional\nsemantic knowledge and state-related causal knowledge implicitly stored in\nLLMs. Subsequently, we propose an adaptive interaction module to aggregate\nattentive visual features conditioned on action-aware prompted knowledge for\nestablishing discriminative and action-aware visual representations, which\nfurther improves the performance.

Then, an adaptive margin-based multi-classification\nmethod using softmax, called the Uncertainty-Aware Margin Function, is\nimplemented in the article. Furthermore, proxy-based loss functions are used to\napply extra constraints between the proxy and sample to optimize their\nrepresentation space distribution. Finally, a renderer is constructed that\noptimizes FR through face reconstruction and vice versa.

However, these approaches face\nsignificant computational efficiency challenges. For instance, current\ntechniques may require tens of minutes to super-resolve a mere 2-second, 1080p\nvideo. In this paper, we present TurboVSR, an ultra-efficient diffusion-based\nvideo super-resolution model. Our core design comprises three key aspects: (1)\nWe employ an autoencoder with a high compression ratio of 32$\\times$32$\\times$8\nto reduce the number of tokens. (2) Highly compressed latents pose substantial\nchallenges for training. We introduce factorized conditioning to mitigate the\nlearning complexity: we first learn to super-resolve the initial frame;\nsubsequently, we condition the super-resolution of the remaining frames on the\nhigh-resolution initial frame and the low-resolution subsequent frames. (3) We\nconvert the pre-trained diffusion model to a shortcut model to enable fewer\nsampling steps, further accelerating inference.

Network pruning reduces the computational complexity\nby removing less important operations while maintaining performance. However,\npruning a model on an unseen data domain, leads to a misevaluation of weight\nsignificance, resulting in suboptimal resource assignment. In this work, we\nfind that task-sensitive layers initially fail to improve the feature\nrepresentation on downstream tasks, leading to performance loss for early\npruning decisions. To address this problem, we introduce Pruning by Block\nBenefit (P3B), a pruning method that utilizes the relative contribution on\nblock level to globally assign parameter resources.

Existing\napproaches often rely on semantic-level alignment, expecting the model to learn\nnew motion concepts and combine them with other entities (e.g., ''cats'' or\n''dogs'') to produce visually appealing results. However, video data involve\ncomplex spatio-temporal patterns, and focusing solely on semantics cause the\nmodel to overlook the visual complexity of motion. Conversely, tuning only the\nvisual representation leads to semantic confusion in representing the intended\naction. To address these limitations, we propose SynMotion, a new\nmotion-customized video generation model that jointly leverages semantic\nguidance and visual adaptation. At the semantic level, we introduce the\ndual-embedding semantic comprehension mechanism which disentangles subject and\nmotion representations, allowing the model to learn customized motion features\nwhile preserving its generative capabilities for diverse subjects. At the\nvisual level, we integrate parameter-efficient motion adapters into a\npre-trained video generation model to enhance motion fidelity and temporal\ncoherence. Furthermore, we introduce a new embedding-specific training strategy\nwhich \\textbf{alternately optimizes} subject and motion embeddings, supported\nby the manually constructed Subject Prior Video (SPV) training dataset. This\nstrategy promotes motion specificity while preserving generalization across\ndiverse subjects. Lastly, we introduce MotionBench, a newly curated benchmark\nwith diverse motion patterns. Experimental results across both T2V and I2V\nsettings demonstrate that \\method outperforms existing baselines.

However, to date, existing TTA methods primarily focus\non single-model adaptation. In this work, we investigate an intriguing\nquestion: how does cross-model knowledge influence the TTA process? Our\nfindings reveal that, in TTA's unsupervised online setting, each model can\nprovide complementary, confident knowledge to the others, even when there are\nsubstantial differences in model size.

In this paper, we\nintroduce Refine Any object In any ScenE (RAISE), a novel 3D enhancement\nframework that leverages 3D generative priors to recover fine-grained object\ngeometry and appearance under missing views. Starting from substituting\ndegraded objects with proxies, via a 3D generative model with strong 3D\nunderstanding, RAISE progressively refines geometry and texture by aligning\neach proxy to its degraded counterpart in 7-DOF pose, followed by correcting\nspatial and appearance inconsistencies via registration-constrained\nenhancement.

In this work,\nwe first identify a critical issue with existing conditional PT methods: using\nVII as the \"condition\" of prompts yields suboptimal performance, and even\nrandom noise-conditioned prompts can outperform the VII-conditioned\ncounterparts. On further analysis, we find that learning dynamic prompts\nconditioned on Textual Class Information (TCI) is the key to solving the BNT\nproblem. Motivated by this, we then propose Class-adaptive Prompt Tuning\n(CaPT), which enables fast adaptation of tuned models to new classes by\nlearning TCI-conditioned prompts from base classes. Remarkably, CaPT can be\nused as a plugin to mitigate the BNT problem for existing unconditional PT\nschemes. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets show that CaPT consistently\nimproves the performance of five strong unconditional PT baselines with\nnegligible additional computational cost. Additionally, by integrating CaPT\nwith our recently proposed DePT framework, we devise a new conditional PT\napproach, termed DeCaPT, which outperforms the H ACC of the state-of-the-art\nconditional PT scheme by 3.49%, averaged over the 11 datasets.

While various sparse attention methods have been\nproposed, many are designed as training-free inference accelerators or do not\noptimally capture the unique spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in video\ndata when trained natively. This paper introduces Video Mixture of Block\nAttention (VMoBA), a novel sparse attention mechanism specifically adapted for\nVDMs. Motivated by an in-depth analysis of attention patterns within\npre-trained video transformers, which revealed strong spatio-temporal locality,\nvarying query importance, and head-specific concentration levels, VMoBA\nenhances the original MoBA framework with three key modifications: (1) a\nlayer-wise recurrent block partition scheme (1D-2D-3D) to dynamically adapt to\ndiverse spatio-temporal attention patterns and improve efficiency; (2) global\nblock selection to prioritize the most salient query-key block interactions\nacross an entire attention head; and (3) threshold-based block selection to\ndynamically determine the number of attended blocks based on their cumulative\nsimilarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VMoBA significantly\naccelerates the training of VDMs on longer sequences, achieving 2.92x FLOPs and\n1.48x latency speedup, while attaining comparable or even superior generation\nquality to full attention. Furthermore, VMoBA exhibits competitive performance\nin training-free inference, offering 2.40x FLOPs and 1.35x latency speedup for\nhigh-res video generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "VMoBA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5757\u5206\u533a\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u5757\u9009\u62e9\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u56e0\u4e8c\u6b21\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6548\u7387\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u5f81\u6355\u6349\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165VMoBA\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5c42\u9012\u5f52\u5757\u5206\u533a\u3001\u5168\u5c40\u5757\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9608\u503c\u7684\u5757\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u65f6\u7a7a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53472.92x FLOPs\u548c1.48x\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53472.40x FLOPs\u548c1.35x\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "VMoBA\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

A core challenge is the lack of large-scale real-world datasets\nannotated with diverse and fine-grained driving preferences, hindering the\ndevelopment and evaluation of personalized E2EAD models. In this work, we\npresent the first large-scale real-world dataset enriched with annotations\ncapturing diverse driving preferences, establishing a foundation for\npersonalization in E2EAD. We extract static environmental features from\nreal-world road topology and infer dynamic contextual cues using a fine-tuned\nvisual language model (VLM), enabling consistent and fine-grained scenario\nconstruction. Based on these scenarios, we derive objective preference\nannotations through behavioral distribution analysis and rule-based heuristics.\nTo address the inherent subjectivity of driving style, we further employ the\nVLM to generate subjective annotations by jointly modeling scene semantics and\ndriver behavior. Final high-quality labels are obtained through a\nhuman-in-the-loop verification process that fuses both perspectives. Building\non this dataset, we propose the first benchmark for evaluating personalized\nE2EAD models. We assess several state-of-the-art models with and without\npreference conditioning, demonstrating that incorporating personalized\npreferences results in behavior more aligned with human driving.

To this\nend, continual test-time adaptation has attracted much attention, aiming to\nimprove detectors' generalization by fine-tuning a few specific parameters,\ne.g., BatchNorm layers. However, based on a small number of test images,\nfine-tuning certain parameters may affect the representation ability of other\nfixed parameters, leading to performance degradation. Instead, we explore a new\nmechanism, i.e., converting the fine-tuning process to a specific-parameter\ngeneration. Particularly, we first design a dual-path LoRA-based domain-aware\nadapter that disentangles features into domain-invariant and domain-specific\ncomponents, enabling efficient adaptation. Additionally, a conditional\ndiffusion-based parameter generation mechanism is presented to synthesize the\nadapter's parameters based on the current environment, preventing the\noptimization from getting stuck in local optima.

Among PEFT techniques, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its\nextensions have emerged as particularly effective, allowing efficient model\nadaptation while significantly reducing computational overhead.

To address this, we propose WaRA, a novel PEFT method that\nleverages wavelet transforms to decompose the weight update matrix into a\nmulti-resolution representation. By performing low-rank factorization in the\nwavelet domain and reconstructing updates through an inverse transform, WaRA\nobtains compressed adaptation parameters that harness multi-resolution\nanalysis, enabling it to capture both coarse and fine-grained features while\nproviding greater flexibility and sparser representations than standard LoRA.\nThrough comprehensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that WaRA\nperforms superior on diverse vision tasks, including image generation,\nclassification, and semantic segmentation, significantly enhancing generated\nimage quality while reducing computational complexity.

We design a fully differentiable procedure that constructs the\nmesh-including both vertex locations and connectivity-at every iteration\ndirectly from the parameters of the Gaussians, which are the only quantities\noptimized during training. Our method introduces three key technical\ncontributions: a bidirectional consistency framework ensuring both\nrepresentations-Gaussians and the extracted mesh-capture the same underlying\ngeometry during training; an adaptive mesh extraction process performed at each\ntraining iteration, which uses Gaussians as differentiable pivots for Delaunay\ntriangulation; a novel method for computing signed distance values from the 3D\nGaussians that enables precise surface extraction while avoiding geometric\nerosion.

However, due to the need for per-sample network\ntraining, the encoding speeds of these methods are too slow for practical\nadoption. We develop a library to allow us to disentangle and review the\ncomponents of methods from the NeRV family, reframing their performance in\nterms of not only size-quality trade-offs, but also impacts on training time.\nWe uncover principles for effective video INR design and propose a\nstate-of-the-art configuration of these components, Rabbit NeRV (RNeRV). When\nall methods are given equal training time (equivalent to 300 NeRV epochs) for 7\ndifferent UVG videos at 1080p, RNeRV achieves +1.27% PSNR on average compared\nto the best-performing alternative for each video in our NeRV library. We then\ntackle the encoding speed issue head-on by investigating the viability of\nhyper-networks, which predict INR weights from video inputs, to disentangle\ntraining from encoding to allow for real-time encoding. We propose masking the\nweights of the predicted INR during training to allow for variable, higher\nquality compression, resulting in 1.7% improvements to both PSNR and MS-SSIM at\n0.037 bpp on the UCF-101 dataset, and we increase hyper-network parameters by\n0.4% for 2.5%/2.7% improvements to PSNR/MS-SSIM with equal bpp and similar\nspeeds.
