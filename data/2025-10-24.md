### [1] [DeBERTa-KC: A Transformer-Based Classifier for Knowledge Construction in Online Learning Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19858)
*Jindi Wang,Yidi Zhang,Zhaoxing Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeBERTa-KC是一个基于Transformer的模型，用于自动分类在线科学学习讨论中的知识构建水平，在YouTube科学频道评论数据集上取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在开发能够自动分析在线科学学习环境中知识构建水平的工具，以解决传统人工分析难以规模化的问题。

Method: 扩展DeBERTa-v3模型，结合Focal Loss、Label Smoothing和R-Drop正则化技术来处理类别不平衡和增强泛化能力，构建了端到端的可复现流程。

Result: 在10折分层交叉验证中，DeBERTa-KC取得了0.836±0.008的宏F1分数，显著优于经典和Transformer基线模型，对高阶认知参与表现出强敏感性。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型能够有效捕捉非正式数字学习环境中知识构建的细微指标，为话语分析和认知参与评估工具的开发提供了可扩展的理论指导方法。

Abstract: This study presents DeBERTa-KC, a transformer-based model for automatic
classification of knowledge construction (KC) levels in online science learning
discourse. Using comments collected from four popular YouTube science channels
(2022--2024), a balanced corpus of 20,000 manually annotated samples was
created across four KC categories: \textit{nonKC}, \textit{Share},
\textit{Explore}, and \textit{Negotiate}. The proposed model extends DeBERTa-v3
with Focal Loss, Label Smoothing, and R-Drop regularization to address class
imbalance and enhance generalization. A reproducible end-to-end pipeline was
implemented, encompassing data extraction, annotation, preprocessing, training,
and evaluation. Across 10-fold stratified cross-validation, DeBERTa-KC achieved
a macro-F1 of $0.836 \pm 0.008$, significantly out-performing both classical
and transformer baselines ($p<0.01$). Per-category results indicate strong
sensitivity to higher-order epistemic engagement, particularly in
\textit{Explore} and \textit{Negotiate} discourse. These findings demonstrate
that large language models can effectively capture nuanced indicators of
knowledge construction in informal digital learning environments, offering
scalable, theory-informed approaches to discourse analysis and the development
of automated tools for assessing epistemic engagement.

### [2] [An Evaluation of the Pedagogical Soundness and Usability of AI-Generated Lesson Plans Across Different Models and Prompt Frameworks in High-School Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19866)
*Xincheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了五个主流大语言模型生成高中物理课程教案的教学合理性和可用性，发现模型选择主要影响可读性，而提示框架结构对事实准确性和教学完整性影响更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估AI生成教案的教学质量和可用性，为教育工作者提供选择模型和提示框架的指导。

Method: 使用五个大语言模型和三种提示框架生成15个关于电磁波谱的高中物理教案，通过四个自动化计算指标进行分析。

Result: DeepSeek生成最易读的教案，Claude语言最密集；RACE框架产生最低的幻觉指数和最高的课程标准对齐；所有教案的学习目标主要集中在布鲁姆分类法的低阶认知层次。

Conclusion: 可读性主要由模型设计决定，而教学可靠性和课程对齐更依赖提示框架。最佳配置是结合可读性优化的模型、RACE框架和明确的概念清单。

Abstract: This study evaluates the pedagogical soundness and usability of AI-generated
lesson plans across five leading large language models: ChatGPT (GPT-5), Claude
Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, DeepSeek V3.2, and Grok 4. Beyond model choice,
three structured prompt frameworks were tested: TAG (Task, Audience, Goal),
RACE (Role, Audience, Context, Execution), and COSTAR (Context, Objective,
Style, Tone, Audience, Response Format).
  Fifteen lesson plans were generated for a single high-school physics topic,
The Electromagnetic Spectrum. The lesson plans were analyzed through four
automated computational metrics: (1) readability and linguistic complexity, (2)
factual accuracy and hallucination detection, (3) standards and curriculum
alignment, and (4) cognitive demand of learning objectives.
  Results indicate that model selection exerted the strongest influence on
linguistic accessibility, with DeepSeek producing the most readable teaching
plan (FKGL = 8.64) and Claude generating the densest language (FKGL = 19.89).
  The prompt framework structure most strongly affected the factual accuracy
and pedagogical completeness, with the RACE framework yielding the lowest
hallucination index and the highest incidental alignment with NGSS curriculum
standards. Across all models, the learning objectives in the fifteen lesson
plans clustered at the Remember and Understand tiers of Bloom's taxonomy. There
were limited higher-order verbs in the learning objectives extracted.
  Overall, the findings suggest that readability is significantly governed by
model design, while instructional reliability and curricular alignment depend
more on the prompt framework. The most effective configuration for lesson plans
identified in the results was to combine a readability-optimized model with the
RACE framework and an explicit checklist of physics concepts, curriculum
standards, and higher-order objectives.

### [3] [From Denoising to Refining: A Corrective Framework for Vision-Language Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19871)
*Yatai Ji,Teng Wang,Yuying Ge,Zhiheng Liu,Sidi Yang,Ying Shan,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReDiff是一个改进的离散扩散模型框架，通过主动精炼而非被动去噪来解决并行解码中的错误级联问题，显著提升了生成内容的连贯性和事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散扩散模型在视觉语言任务中面临训练-推理差异问题，导致初始令牌错误在并行解码中污染生成上下文，引发错误级联，造成语法错误和语义幻觉。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：首先训练模型修正合成错误，建立基础修订能力；然后通过在线自校正循环，让模型学习从专家修正中改进自己的缺陷草稿，实现错误驱动学习。

Result: 实验表明ReDiff显著提高了生成内容的连贯性和事实准确性，实现了比传统去噪方法更稳定高效的并行生成。

Conclusion: ReDiff通过主动精炼框架有效打破了错误级联，为离散扩散模型的实用化提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a promising direction for
vision-language tasks, offering bidirectional context modeling and theoretical
parallelization. However, their practical application is severely hindered by a
train-inference discrepancy, which leads to catastrophic error cascades:
initial token errors during parallel decoding pollute the generation context,
triggering a chain reaction of compounding errors and leading to syntactic
errors and semantic hallucinations. To address this fundamental challenge, we
reframe the generation process from passive denoising to active refining. We
introduce ReDiff, a refining-enhanced diffusion framework that teaches the
model to identify and correct its own errors. Our approach features a two-stage
training process: first, we instill a foundational revision capability by
training the model to revise synthetic errors; second, we implement a novel
online self-correction loop where the model is explicitly trained to revise its
own flawed drafts by learning from an expert's corrections. This mistake-driven
learning endows the model with the crucial ability to revisit and refine its
already generated output, effectively breaking the error cascade. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ReDiff significantly improves the coherence and
factual accuracy of generated content, enabling stable and efficient parallel
generation far superior to traditional denoising methods. Our codes and models
are available at https://rediff-hku.github.io/.

### [4] [Stream: Scaling up Mechanistic Interpretability to Long Context in LLMs via Sparse Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19875)
*J Rosser,José Luis Redondo García,Gustavo Penha,Konstantina Palla,Hugues Bouchard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Sparse Tracing技术，通过动态稀疏注意力高效分析长上下文注意力模式，Stream算法以近线性时间和线性空间估计稀疏注意力掩码，实现大规模可解释性分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型扩展到百万token上下文，传统机制可解释性技术因注意力复杂度呈二次方增长，在超过10万token时需要TB级内存，无法有效分析长上下文。

Method: 提出Stream算法，采用可编译的分层剪枝方法，通过二分搜索式精化保留每个查询的前k个关键块，同时保持模型的下一个token行为。

Result: 在长思维链推理轨迹中识别思维锚点，剪枝97-99%的token交互；在RULER基准上保留关键检索路径，剪枝90-96%的交互，暴露从针到输出的分层路径。

Conclusion: Sparse Tracing为分析注意力模式和追踪信息流提供了实用的即插即用工具，使长上下文可解释性在消费级GPU上可行，有助于民主化思维链监控。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale to million-token contexts, traditional
Mechanistic Interpretability techniques for analyzing attention scale
quadratically with context length, demanding terabytes of memory beyond 100,000
tokens. We introduce Sparse Tracing, a novel technique that leverages dynamic
sparse attention to efficiently analyze long context attention patterns. We
present Stream, a compilable hierarchical pruning algorithm that estimates
per-head sparse attention masks in near-linear time $O(T \log T)$ and linear
space $O(T)$, enabling one-pass interpretability at scale. Stream performs a
binary-search-style refinement to retain only the top-$k$ key blocks per query
while preserving the model's next-token behavior. We apply Stream to long
chain-of-thought reasoning traces and identify thought anchors while pruning
97-99\% of token interactions. On the RULER benchmark, Stream preserves
critical retrieval paths while discarding 90-96\% of interactions and exposes
layer-wise routes from the needle to output. Our method offers a practical
drop-in tool for analyzing attention patterns and tracing information flow
without terabytes of caches. By making long context interpretability feasible
on consumer GPUs, Sparse Tracing helps democratize chain-of-thought monitoring.

### [5] [Automated HIV Screening on Dutch EHR with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19879)
*Lang Zhou,Amrish Jhingoer,Yinghao Luo,Klaske Vliegenthart--Jongbloed,Carlijn Jordans,Ben Werkhoven,Tom Seinen,Erik van Mulligen,Casper Rokx,Yunlei Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用大语言模型分析非结构化电子健康记录文本，以确定患者是否适合进行HIV进一步检测的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注结构化数据，但忽略了临床笔记等非结构化文本数据中可能包含的HIV风险相关信息。

Method: 构建了一个新颖的流程，利用大语言模型分析非结构化的EHR文本数据。

Result: 在鹿特丹伊拉斯谟大学医学中心的临床数据上，该流程实现了高准确率和低假阴性率。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效利用非结构化EHR文本进行HIV筛查，为早期诊断提供了新的机会。

Abstract: Efficient screening and early diagnosis of HIV are critical for reducing
onward transmission. Although large scale laboratory testing is not feasible,
the widespread adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers new
opportunities to address this challenge. Existing research primarily focuses on
applying machine learning methods to structured data, such as patient
demographics, for improving HIV diagnosis. However, these approaches often
overlook unstructured text data such as clinical notes, which potentially
contain valuable information relevant to HIV risk. In this study, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze
unstructured EHR text and determine a patient's eligibility for further HIV
testing. Experimental results on clinical data from Erasmus University Medical
Center Rotterdam demonstrate that our pipeline achieved high accuracy while
maintaining a low false negative rate.

### [6] [An Expert-grounded benchmark of General Purpose LLMs in LCA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19886)
*Artur Donaldson,Bharathan Balaji,Cajetan Oriekezie,Manish Kumar,Laure Patouillard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究首次通过专家基准测试评估了11个通用大语言模型在生命周期评估(LCA)中的表现，发现37%的响应包含不准确信息，幻觉率高达40%，但模型在解释质量和格式遵循方面表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI和LLM在LCA中的应用日益增多，但缺乏对其可靠性、鲁棒性和可用性的系统评估，且该领域缺乏标准化的评估框架和明确的基准真相。

Method: 评估了11个通用LLM在22个LCA相关任务上的表现，由17位经验丰富的从业者根据科学准确性、解释质量、鲁棒性、可验证性和指令遵循等标准对模型输出进行评审，共收集168份专家评审。

Result: 专家判定37%的响应包含不准确或误导性信息；准确性和解释质量评分普遍为平均或良好；幻觉率差异显著，某些模型产生幻觉引用的比例高达40%；开源模型与闭源模型在准确性和解释质量等标准上表现相当。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在LCA中简单应用LLM的风险，特别是将其视为自由形式的神谕时，但也显示了在解释质量和减轻简单任务劳动强度方面的益处。没有基础机制支持的通用LLM使用存在风险。

Abstract: Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular large language
models (LLMs), are increasingly being explored as tools to support life cycle
assessment (LCA). While demonstrations exist across environmental and social
domains, systematic evidence on their reliability, robustness, and usability
remains limited. This study provides the first expert-grounded benchmark of
LLMs in LCA, addressing the absence of standardized evaluation frameworks in a
field where no clear ground truth or consensus protocols exist.
  Methods: We evaluated eleven general-purpose LLMs, spanning both commercial
and open-source families, across 22 LCA-related tasks. Seventeen experienced
practitioners reviewed model outputs against criteria directly relevant to LCA
practice, including scientific accuracy, explanation quality, robustness,
verifiability, and adherence to instructions. We collected 168 expert reviews.
  Results: Experts judged 37% of responses to contain inaccurate or misleading
information. Ratings of accuracy and quality of explanation were generally
rated average or good on many models even smaller models, and format adherence
was generally rated favourably. Hallucination rates varied significantly, with
some models producing hallucinated citations at rates of up to 40%. There was
no clear-cut distinction between ratings on open-weight versus closed-weight
LLMs, with open-weight models outperforming or competing on par with
closed-weight models on criteria such as accuracy and quality of explanation.
  Conclusion: These findings highlight the risks of applying LLMs na\"ively in
LCA, such as when LLMs are treated as free-form oracles, while also showing
benefits especially around quality of explanation and alleviating labour
intensiveness of simple tasks. The use of general-purpose LLMs without
grounding mechanisms presents ...

### [7] [Can They Dixit? Yes they Can! Dixit as a Playground for Multimodal Language Model Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19892)
*Nishant Balepur,Dang Nguyen,Dayeon Ki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于游戏的评估方法来全面评估多模态大语言模型（MLMs）的能力，使用Dixit幻想卡牌游戏作为具体实现，通过定量实验验证了该方法与现有基准的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MLMs评估方法存在局限：静态基准无法综合评估能力，人工或模型对比主观性强、成本高，且模型可能利用表面特征（如冗长）来提升胜率。

Method: 提出基于游戏的评估框架，使用Dixit卡牌游戏作为评估平台。游戏要求玩家为卡片生成既能欺骗部分玩家选择该卡片，又不能欺骗所有玩家的描述，需要多种能力协同工作。

Result: 五个MLMs在Dixit中的胜率排名与流行MLM基准的排名完全相关。人类与MLM玩家对局揭示了代理策略的差异和MLM推理能力的改进空间。

Conclusion: 基于游戏的评估提供了一种全面、客观且引人入胜的MLMs评估方法，能够克服传统评估方法的局限性，有效揭示模型的能力差异和改进方向。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLMs) are often assessed on static,
individual benchmarks -- which cannot jointly assess MLM capabilities in a
single task -- or rely on human or model pairwise comparisons -- which is
highly subjective, expensive, and allows models to exploit superficial
shortcuts (e.g., verbosity) to inflate their win-rates. To overcome these
issues, we propose game-based evaluations to holistically assess MLM
capabilities. Games require multiple abilities for players to win, are
inherently competitive, and are governed by fix, objective rules, and makes
evaluation more engaging, providing a robust framework to address the
aforementioned challenges. We manifest this evaluation specifically through
Dixit, a fantasy card game where players must generate captions for a card that
trick some, but not all players, into selecting the played card. Our
quantitative experiments with five MLMs show Dixit win-rate rankings are
perfectly correlated with those on popular MLM benchmarks, while games between
human and MLM players in Dixit reveal several differences between agent
strategies and areas of improvement for MLM reasoning.

### [8] [Large Language Model enabled Mathematical Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19895)
*Guoyun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了DeepSeek-R1 LLM在运筹学优化建模中的潜力，通过四种基准测试和多种缓解幻觉的策略来提升模型在自然语言到数学公式转换的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化方法严重依赖领域专家将实际问题转化为可求解的数学模型，而现有LLM存在高成本和幻觉问题，限制了在供应链等实际场景中的应用。DeepSeek-R1作为成本效益高的模型，在运筹学应用中的效果尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用DeepSeek-R1模型，在NL4OPT、IndustryOR、EasyLP和ComplexOR四个运筹学基准上进行系统评估。采用基线评估、幻觉分类学开发，以及LLM-as-a-Judge、少样本学习、工具调用和多智能体框架等缓解策略。

Result: 研究系统评估了DeepSeek-R1在运筹学优化建模中的表现，开发了幻觉分类学并应用多种缓解策略来减少幻觉、提高公式准确性，并更好地对齐用户意图。

Conclusion: DeepSeek-R1作为成本效益高的LLM，在运筹学优化建模中具有应用潜力，通过适当的缓解策略可以显著提升其在自然语言到数学公式转换中的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with optimization modeling
offers a promising avenue for advancing decision-making in operations research
(OR). Traditional optimization methods,such as linear programming, mixed
integer programming, and simulation depend heavily on domain expertise to
translate real-world problems into solvable mathematical models. While solvers
like Gurobi and COPT are powerful, expert input remains essential for defining
objectives, constraints, and variables. This research investigates the
potential of LLMs, specifically the DeepSeek-R1 model, to bridge this
formulation gap using natural language understanding and code generation.
Although prior models like GPT-4, Claude, and Bard have shown strong
performance in NLP and reasoning tasks, their high token costs and tendency
toward hallucinations limit real-world applicability in supply chain contexts.
In contrast, DeepSeek-R1, a cost-efficient and high-performing model trained
with reinforcement learning, presents a viable alternative. Despite its success
in benchmarks such as LiveCodeBench and Math-500, its effectiveness in applied
OR scenarios remains under explored. This study systematically evaluates
DeepSeek-R1 across four key OR benchmarks: NL4OPT, IndustryOR, EasyLP, and
ComplexOR. Our methodology includes baseline assessments, the development of a
hallucination taxonomy, and the application of mitigation strategies like
LLM-as-a-Judge, Few-shot Learning (FSL), Tool Calling, and a Multi-agent
Framework. These techniques aim to reduce hallucinations, enhance formulation
accuracy, and better align model outputs with user intent.

### [9] [Learning from Supervision with Semantic and Episodic Memory: A Reflective Approach to Agent Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19897)
*Jackson Hassell,Dan Zhang,Hannah Kim,Tom Mitchell,Estevam Hruschka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于记忆增强的LLM代理框架，通过存储实例级批评和提炼任务级指导，在不更新参数的情况下从标记示例中学习分类函数，相比仅依赖标签的检索基线准确率提升高达24.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微调方法成本高、灵活性差且不透明，需要探索无需参数更新的学习方式，构建更具适应性和可解释性的LLM代理。

Method: 使用情景记忆存储实例级批评（具体经验），语义记忆提炼可重用的任务级指导，结合标记数据和LLM生成的批评进行学习。

Result: 在多样化任务集上，结合批评的方法比仅依赖标签的检索基线准确率提升高达24.8%，揭示了OpenAI和开源模型在处理事实导向与偏好数据时的行为差异。

Conclusion: 记忆驱动的反思性学习为构建更具适应性和可解释性的LLM代理提供了有前景的途径，模型特性和记忆策略共同塑造学习动态。

Abstract: We investigate how agents built on pretrained large language models can learn
target classification functions from labeled examples without parameter
updates. While conventional approaches like fine-tuning are often costly,
inflexible, and opaque, we propose a memory-augmented framework that leverages
both labeled data and LLM-generated critiques. Our framework uses episodic
memory to store instance-level critiques-capturing specific past
experiences-and semantic memory to distill these into reusable, task-level
guidance. Across a diverse set of tasks, incorporating critiques yields up to a
24.8 percent accuracy improvement over retrieval-based (RAG-style) baselines
that rely only on labels. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we uncover
distinct behavioral differences between OpenAI and opensource models,
particularly in how they handle fact-oriented versus preference-based data. To
interpret how models respond to different representations of supervision
encoded in memory, we introduce a novel metric, suggestibility. This helps
explain observed behaviors and illuminates how model characteristics and memory
strategies jointly shape learning dynamics. Our findings highlight the promise
of memory-driven, reflective learning for building more adaptive and
interpretable LLM agents.

### [10] [LyriCAR: A Difficulty-Aware Curriculum Reinforcement Learning Framework For Controllable Lyric Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19967)
*Le Ren,Xiangjian Zeng,Qingqiang Wu,Ruoxuan Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LyriCAR是一个无监督的歌词翻译框架，通过难度感知课程设计和自适应课程策略，在段落级别实现可控翻译，显著提升翻译质量并减少40%训练步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有歌词翻译方法依赖手工规则和句子级建模，难以内化音乐语言模式和在段落级别保持跨行连贯性和全局押韵。

Method: 提出LyriCAR框架，包含难度感知课程设计器和自适应课程策略，以无监督方式逐步引导模型处理复杂挑战。

Result: 在英中歌词翻译任务中，LyriCAR在标准翻译指标和多维奖励分数上均达到最先进水平，训练步骤减少近40%。

Conclusion: LyriCAR通过课程学习有效解决了歌词翻译中的音乐约束平衡问题，实现了高质量的无监督翻译。

Abstract: Lyric translation is a challenging task that requires balancing multiple
musical constraints. Existing methods often rely on hand-crafted rules and
sentence-level modeling, which restrict their ability to internalize
musical-linguistic patterns and to generalize effectively at the paragraph
level, where cross-line coherence and global rhyme are crucial. In this work,
we propose LyriCAR, a novel framework for controllable lyric translation that
operates in a fully unsupervised manner. LyriCAR introduces a difficulty-aware
curriculum designer and an adaptive curriculum strategy, ensuring efficient
allocation of training resources, accelerating convergence, and improving
overall translation quality by guiding the model with increasingly complex
challenges. Extensive experiments on the EN-ZH lyric translation task show that
LyriCAR achieves state-of-the-art results across both standard translation
metrics and multi-dimensional reward scores, surpassing strong baselines.
Notably, the adaptive curriculum strategy reduces training steps by nearly 40%
while maintaining superior performance. Code, data and model can be accessed at

### [11] [LLM-Augmented Symbolic NLU System for More Reliable Continuous Causal Statement Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19988)
*Xin Lian,Kenneth D. Forbus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合大语言模型和符号自然语言理解的混合方法，旨在获得两种方法的优势，在常识科学文本中提取和解释数量和因果规律任务上表现优于纯符号方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然应用广泛但存在幻觉和输出不一致问题，符号NLU系统虽然可解释性强但覆盖范围有限且需要专业知识维护。希望结合两者的优势。

Method: 使用LLM进行重述和文本简化以提供广泛覆盖，并作为填补知识缺口的来源；使用符号NLU生成可用于推理和增量学习的结构化关系表示。

Result: 在提取和解释常识科学文本中的数量和因果规律任务上，混合方法显著优于纯符号管道。

Conclusion: 混合方法结合了LLM的广泛覆盖能力和符号NLU的结构化表示优势，在特定任务上取得了更好的性能。

Abstract: Despite the broad applicability of large language models (LLMs), their
reliance on probabilistic inference makes them vulnerable to errors such as
hallucination in generated facts and inconsistent output structure in natural
language understanding (NLU) tasks. By contrast, symbolic NLU systems provide
interpretable understanding grounded in curated lexicons, semantic resources,
and syntactic & semantic interpretation rules. They produce relational
representations that can be used for accurate reasoning and planning, as well
as incremental debuggable learning. However, symbolic NLU systems tend to be
more limited in coverage than LLMs and require scarce knowledge representation
and linguistics skills to extend and maintain. This paper explores a hybrid
approach that integrates the broad-coverage language processing of LLMs with
the symbolic NLU capabilities of producing structured relational
representations to hopefully get the best of both approaches. We use LLMs for
rephrasing and text simplification, to provide broad coverage, and as a source
of information to fill in knowledge gaps more automatically. We use symbolic
NLU to produce representations that can be used for reasoning and for
incremental learning. We evaluate this approach on the task of extracting and
interpreting quantities and causal laws from commonsense science texts, along
with symbolic- and LLM-only pipelines. Our results suggest that our hybrid
method works significantly better than the symbolic-only pipeline.

*Michael A. Covington*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于依赖关系的自然语言句子解析算法，采用逐词处理方式，能够实时将每个词附加到依赖树中，模拟人脑解析过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种更接近人脑处理方式的自然语言解析算法，与传统的短语结构解析不同，该算法能够在每个词出现时立即进行依赖关系分析。

Method: 采用逐词处理的依赖解析方法，每个词在可以附加时立即被附加到依赖树中，算法的最坏时间复杂度为O(n³)，但实际应用中只在小规模n时出现最坏情况。

Result: 成功实现了一种模拟人脑解析过程的依赖解析算法，能够在自然语言处理中高效构建依赖树。

Conclusion: 该依赖解析算法不仅计算效率高，而且更符合人类语言处理的认知过程，为自然语言处理提供了新的解析范式。

Abstract: This paper presents a fundamental algorithm for parsing natural language
sentences into dependency trees. Unlike phrase-structure (constituency)
parsers, this algorithm operates one word at a time, attaching each word as
soon as it can be attached, corresponding to properties claimed for the parser
in the human brain. Like phrase-structure parsing, its worst-case complexity is
$O(n^3)$, but in human language, the worst case occurs only for small $n$.

### [13] [Beyond MedQA: Towards Real-world Clinical Decision Making in the Era of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20001)
*Yunpeng Xiao,Carl Yang,Mark Mai,Xiao Hu,Kai Shu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一范式来评估临床决策任务，将任务按临床背景和临床问题两个维度分类，随着背景和问题接近真实临床环境，难度增加。该范式旨在澄清假设、标准化比较，并指导开发有临床意义的LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学数据集如MedQA依赖简化的问答形式，不能充分代表真实世界的临床决策过程，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 提出基于临床背景和临床问题两个维度的统一分类范式，总结现有数据集设置，回顾训练时和测试时技术，并扩展评估指标到效率、可解释性等方面。

Result: 建立了一个系统化的临床决策任务评估框架，能够更准确地反映LLM在真实临床环境中的表现。

Conclusion: 该范式有助于澄清假设、标准化比较，并为开发具有临床意义的LLM提供指导，同时指出了未来面临的挑战。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical use. They are often
evaluated using datasets such as MedQA. However, Many medical datasets, such as
MedQA, rely on simplified Question-Answering (Q\A) that underrepresents
real-world clinical decision-making. Based on this, we propose a unifying
paradigm that characterizes clinical decision-making tasks along two
dimensions: Clinical Backgrounds and Clinical Questions. As the background and
questions approach the real clinical environment, the difficulty increases. We
summarize the settings of existing datasets and benchmarks along two
dimensions. Then we review methods to address clinical decision-making,
including training-time and test-time techniques, and summarize when they help.
Next, we extend evaluation beyond accuracy to include efficiency,
explainability. Finally, we highlight open challenges. Our paradigm clarifies
assumptions, standardizes comparisons, and guides the development of clinically
meaningful LLMs.

moderately-resourced languages like Modern Greek is often hindered by a
fragmented research landscape, a lack of architectural diversity and reliance
on limited context-length models. This is particularly true in specialized,
high-value domains such as law, where existing models are frequently confined
to early transformer architectures with a restrictive 512-token window,
insufficient for analyzing long legal documents. To address these challenges,
this paper presents Greek Embedding Models, a new family of transformer models
for Greek language built upon a foundation of extensive, quality-driven data
curation. We detail the construction of several large-scale Greek corpora,
emphasizing a rigorous, quality-based filtering and preprocessing methodology
to create high-value training datasets from both general-domain and specialized
legal sources. On this carefully curated foundation, we pre-train and
systematically evaluate a diverse suite of modern architectures, which has not
previously applied to Greek language, such as ELECTRA, ConvBERT and ModernBERT.
Furthermore, we propose the first bilingual Greek-English Embedding Models
tailored for the legal domain. The extensive experiments on downstream tasks
demonstrate that the new class of models establish the effectiveness of the
proposed approach, highlighting that the GEM-RoBERTa and GEM-ConvBERT models
significantly outperform existing baselines.

TL;DR: 该博士论文通过改进预训练神经语言模型的迁移学习方法，提升了序列标注任务的性能，提出了三种改进策略：多任务模型、架构修改和生成式监督上下文微调框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练神经语言模型在序列标注任务中的迁移学习效果仍有提升空间，需要针对性地改进适应方法以获得最佳性能。

Method: 1) 引入多任务模型，整合领域无关文本处理系统的额外信号；2) 修改自回归大语言模型架构，实现层间双向信息流；3) 使用生成式监督上下文微调框架，结合响应导向适应策略。

Result: 提出的模型、方法和框架证明，通过有针对性的迁移学习范式，预训练神经语言模型在序列标注任务中能达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: 预训练神经语言模型在序列标注任务中的性能可以通过特定的迁移学习改进策略得到显著提升，包括多任务学习、架构修改和生成式微调等方法。

Abstract: This doctoral thesis improves the transfer learning for sequence labeling
tasks by adapting pre-trained neural language models. The proposed improvements
in transfer learning involve introducing a multi-task model that incorporates
an additional signal, a method based on architectural modifications in
autoregressive large language models, and a sequence labeling framework for
autoregressive large language models utilizing supervised in-context
fine-tuning combined with response-oriented adaptation strategies. The first
improvement is given in the context of domain transfer for the event trigger
detection task. The domain transfer of the event trigger detection task can be
improved by incorporating an additional signal obtained from a
domain-independent text processing system into a multi-task model. The second
improvement involves modifying the model's architecture. For that purpose, a
method is proposed to enable bidirectional information flow across layers of
autoregressive large language models. The third improvement utilizes
autoregressive large language models as text generators through a generative
supervised in-context fine-tuning framework. The proposed model, method, and
framework demonstrate that pre-trained neural language models achieve their
best performance on sequence labeling tasks when adapted through targeted
transfer learning paradigms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ToolScope通过工具合并和检索机制解决LLM代理在复杂任务中工具选择的问题，提高工具选择准确率8.38%-38.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界工具集常包含冗余工具，存在名称和描述重叠的问题，导致工具选择模糊性和准确性下降。同时LLM面临严格的输入上下文限制，无法有效考虑大型工具集。

Method: 提出ToolScope框架，包含：(1) ToolScopeMerger带自动校正功能，自动审计和修复工具合并，减少冗余；(2) ToolScopeRetriever对每个查询排序并选择最相关工具，压缩工具集以适应上下文限制而不损失准确性。

Result: 在三个最先进的LLM和三个开源工具使用基准测试上的评估显示，工具选择准确率提升了8.38%到38.6%。

Conclusion: ToolScope在增强LLM工具使用方面表现出有效性，能够显著提高工具选择的准确性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents rely on external tools to solve complex
tasks, but real-world toolsets often contain redundant tools with overlapping
names and descriptions, introducing ambiguity and reducing selection accuracy.
LLMs also face strict input context limits, preventing efficient consideration
of large toolsets. To address these challenges, we propose ToolScope, which
includes: (1) ToolScopeMerger with Auto-Correction to automatically audit and
fix tool merges, reducing redundancy, and (2) ToolScopeRetriever to rank and
select only the most relevant tools for each query, compressing toolsets to fit
within context limits without sacrificing accuracy. Evaluations on three
state-of-the-art LLMs and three open-source tool-use benchmarks show gains of
8.38% to 38.6% in tool selection accuracy, demonstrating ToolScope's
effectiveness in enhancing LLM tool use.

Motivation: 现有多语言基准在捕捉低资源文化细微差别方面存在不足，需要专门的文化知识评估数据集。

Method: 构建包含民俗传统、烹饪艺术和方言的孟加拉语文化知识数据集BLanCK，并对多个多语言语言模型进行评估。

Result: 模型在非文化类别表现良好，但在文化知识方面表现显著较差；提供上下文后所有模型性能都有显著提升。

Abstract: Recent progress in NLP research has demonstrated remarkable capabilities of
large language models (LLMs) across a wide range of tasks. While recent
multilingual benchmarks have advanced cultural evaluation for LLMs, critical
gaps remain in capturing the nuances of low-resource cultures. Our work
addresses these limitations through a Bengali Language Cultural Knowledge
(BLanCK) dataset including folk traditions, culinary arts, and regional
dialects. Our investigation of several multilingual language models shows that
while these models perform well in non-cultural categories, they struggle
significantly with cultural knowledge and performance improves substantially
across all models when context is provided, emphasizing context-aware
architectures and culturally curated training data.

Motivation: 提升小语言模型在波斯语等资源匮乏语言中的推理能力，特别是在医学问答等专业领域的应用

Method: 将医学多选题数据集翻译成波斯语，使用RLAIF生成拒绝-偏好答案对，通过CoT推理生成正确和错误的推理轨迹，使用DPO进行训练

Result: 训练后的模型在仅使用450万token数据集的情况下，超越了使用5700万token训练的前代模型gaokerena-V

Conclusion: 推理导向的训练方法在数据有限的情况下，能够高效开发领域特定的语言模型

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities in small language models is critical for
specialized applications such as medical question answering, particularly in
underrepresented languages like Persian. In this study, we employ Reinforcement
Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) and Direct preference optimization (DPO) to
improve the reasoning skills of a general-purpose Persian language model. To
achieve this, we translated a multiple-choice medical question-answering
dataset into Persian and used RLAIF to generate rejected-preferred answer
pairs, which are essential for DPO training. By prompting both teacher and
student models to produce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning responses, we
compiled a dataset containing correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories.
This dataset, comprising 2 million tokens in preferred answers and 2.5 million
tokens in rejected ones, was used to train a baseline model, significantly
enhancing its medical reasoning capabilities in Persian. Remarkably, the
resulting model outperformed its predecessor, gaokerena-V, which was trained on
approximately 57 million tokens, despite leveraging a much smaller dataset.
These results highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of reasoning-focused
training approaches in developing domain-specific language models with limited
data availability.

TL;DR: 提出了CreativityPrism框架，将创造力分解为质量、新颖性和多样性三个维度，用于全面评估大语言模型在不同领域的创造力表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型创造力评估方法碎片化，缺乏统一框架，主要原因是创造力的定义和测量标准在不同领域和任务中存在差异。

Method: 设计CreativityPrism框架，包含发散思维、创意写作和逻辑推理三个领域，9个任务和20个评估指标，对17个先进的大语言模型进行评估。

Result: 专有模型和开源模型之间存在显著差距；同一领域内任务表现高度相关，跨领域相关性较弱；多样性和质量指标强相关，新颖性与其他维度相关性较弱。

Conclusion: 创造力在不同任务和维度上的表现不具有普遍性，需要采用整体性评估方法来全面衡量大语言模型的创造力。

Abstract: Creativity is often seen as a hallmark of human intelligence. While large
language models (LLMs) are increasingly perceived as producing creative text,
there is still no holistic framework to evaluate their creativity across
diverse scenarios. Existing evaluation methods remain fragmented, with dramatic
variation across domains and tasks, largely due to differing definitions and
measurements of creativity. Inspired by the hypothesis that creativity is not
one fixed idea, we propose CreativityPrism, an evaluation analysis framework
that decomposes creativity into three dimensions: quality, novelty, and
diversity. CreativityPrism incorporates nine tasks, three domains, i.e.,
divergent thinking, creative writing, and logical reasoning, and twenty
evaluation metrics, which measure each dimension in task-specific, unique ways.
We evaluate 17 state-of-the-art (SoTA) proprietary and open-sourced LLMs on
CreativityPrism and analyze the performance correlations among different
metrics and task domains. Our results reveal a notable gap between proprietary
and open-source models. Overall, model performance tends to be highly
correlated across tasks within the same domain and less so across different
domains. Among evaluation dimensions, diversity and quality metrics show strong
correlations - models that perform well on one often excel on the other -
whereas novelty exhibits much weaker correlation with either. These findings
support our hypothesis that strong performance in one creativity task or
dimension does not necessarily generalize to others, underscoring the need for
a holistic evaluation of LLM creativity.

TL;DR: ARTER提出了一种无需深度微调的实体链接方法，通过自适应路由和针对性推理，在保持高效率的同时实现高性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统实体链接方法依赖大量标注数据和模型微调，而现有少样本方法虽然减少了训练需求，但存在LLM推理效率低下的问题

Method: 采用结构化流水线，结合候选生成、基于上下文的评分、自适应路由和选择性推理，通过互补信号将上下文提及分类为简单和困难案例，分别由低计算实体链接器和针对性LLM推理处理

Result: 在标准基准测试中，ARTER在5/6数据集上平均提升2.53%，最高提升4.47%，性能与全LLM推理流水线相当，但LLM token使用量减少一半

Conclusion: ARTER通过智能路由策略在保持高性能的同时显著提高了实体链接的效率，为少样本实体链接提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Entity Linking (EL) has traditionally relied on large annotated datasets and
extensive model fine-tuning. While recent few-shot methods leverage large
language models (LLMs) through prompting to reduce training requirements, they
often suffer from inefficiencies due to expensive LLM-based reasoning. ARTER
(Adaptive Routing and Targeted Entity Reasoning) presents a structured pipeline
that achieves high performance without deep fine-tuning by strategically
combining candidate generation, context-based scoring, adaptive routing, and
selective reasoning. ARTER computes a small set of complementary signals(both
embedding and LLM-based) over the retrieved candidates to categorize contextual
mentions into easy and hard cases. The cases are then handled by a
low-computational entity linker (e.g. ReFinED) and more expensive targeted
LLM-based reasoning respectively. On standard benchmarks, ARTER outperforms
ReFinED by up to +4.47%, with an average gain of +2.53% on 5 out of 6 datasets,
and performs comparably to pipelines using LLM-based reasoning for all
mentions, while being as twice as efficient in terms of the number of LLM
tokens.

TL;DR: BoundRL是一种用于复杂结构化文本分割的新方法，通过生成起始标记序列并定位原始文本来重构内容，大幅降低推理成本并减少幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着结构化文本在技术报告和生成式AI提示等领域的复杂性增加，传统基于句子或段落的分割方法无法有效处理包含表格、代码片段和占位符等元素的文本，因此需要更有效的语义分割方法。

Method: BoundRL采用强化学习与可验证奖励（RLVR），通过生成起始标记序列来重构文本内容，并使用系统扰动生成中间候选方案来避免熵崩溃。

Result: 实验表明，BoundRL使小型语言模型（1.7B参数）在复杂提示分割任务上优于大型模型的少样本提示，RLVR相比监督微调有显著改进，中间候选方案进一步提升了性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: BoundRL为复杂结构化文本的分割提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案，特别适用于LLM应用中的复杂提示处理，在性能和成本方面都表现出色。

Abstract: As structured texts become increasingly complex across diverse domains --
from technical reports to generative AI prompts -- the need for text
segmentation into semantically meaningful components becomes critical. Such
texts often contain elements beyond plain language, including tables, code
snippets, and placeholders, which conventional sentence- or paragraph-level
segmentation methods cannot handle effectively. To address this challenge, we
propose BoundRL, a novel and efficient approach that jointly performs
token-level text segmentation and label prediction for long structured texts.
Instead of generating complete contents for each segment, it generates only a
sequence of starting tokens and reconstructs the complete contents by locating
these tokens within the original texts, thereby reducing inference costs by
orders of magnitude and minimizing hallucination. To adapt the model for the
output format, BoundRL~performs reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards
(RLVR) with a specifically designed reward that jointly optimizes document
reconstruction fidelity and semantic alignment. To mitigate entropy collapse,
it further constructs intermediate candidates by systematically perturbing a
fraction of generated sequences of segments to create stepping stones toward
higher-quality solutions. To demonstrate BoundRL's effectiveness on
particularly challenging structured texts, we focus evaluation on complex
prompts used for LLM applications. Experiments show that BoundRL enables small
language models (1.7B parameters) to outperform few-shot prompting of much
larger models. Moreover, RLVR with our designed reward yields significant
improvements over supervised fine-tuning, and incorporating intermediate
candidates further improves both performance and generalization.

TL;DR: LLMs在立场检测任务中存在显著偏见，会错误地将支持大麻的观点与低文本复杂性关联，将非裔美国人方言与反对特朗普关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型从预训练数据中继承了刻板印象，导致在立场检测等敏感NLP任务中对某些社会群体产生偏见行为，但社区对此类偏见的评估一直被忽视。

Method: 在零样本设置下，自动标注现有立场检测数据集中的帖子，添加两个属性：特定群体的方言/语言变体和文本复杂性/可读性，研究这些属性是否影响模型的立场检测决策。

Result: 结果显示LLMs在立场检测任务中表现出显著刻板印象，如错误地将支持大麻观点与低文本复杂性关联，将非裔美国人方言与反对特朗普关联。

Conclusion: LLMs在立场检测任务中存在基于方言和文本复杂性的系统性偏见，需要进一步解决这些偏见问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models inherit stereotypes from their pretraining data,
leading to biased behavior toward certain social groups in many Natural
Language Processing tasks, such as hateful speech detection or sentiment
analysis. Surprisingly, the evaluation of this kind of bias in stance detection
methods has been largely overlooked by the community. Stance Detection involves
labeling a statement as being against, in favor, or neutral towards a specific
target and is among the most sensitive NLP tasks, as it often relates to
political leanings. In this paper, we focus on the bias of Large Language
Models when performing stance detection in a zero-shot setting. We
automatically annotate posts in pre-existing stance detection datasets with two
attributes: dialect or vernacular of a specific group and text
complexity/readability, to investigate whether these attributes influence the
model's stance detection decisions. Our results show that LLMs exhibit
significant stereotypes in stance detection tasks, such as incorrectly
associating pro-marijuana views with low text complexity and African American
dialect with opposition to Donald Trump.

Motivation: 当前搜索智能体缺乏同时进行深度多跳检索推理和大规模信息收集的能力，这在市场分析和商业开发等实际应用中至关重要。

Method: 通过转换现有数据集的方法构建了包含220个问题的基准，这些问题需要处理大量数据并进行深度多跳检索推理。

Result: 实验显示最先进智能体在DeepWideSearch上仅达到2.39%的平均成功率，错误分析揭示了四种失败模式：缺乏反思、过度依赖内部知识、检索不足和上下文溢出。

Conclusion: DeepWideSearch基准突显了当前智能体架构在整合深度和广度搜索方面的关键限制，将公开发布以推动更强大信息搜索智能体的研究。

Abstract: Current search agents fundamentally lack the ability to simultaneously
perform \textit{deep} reasoning over multi-hop retrieval and
\textit{wide}-scale information collection-a critical deficiency for real-world
applications like comprehensive market analysis and business development. To
bridge this gap, we introduce DeepWideSearch, the first benchmark explicitly
designed to evaluate agents to integrate depth and width in information
seeking. In DeepWideSearch, agents must process a large volume of data, each
requiring deep reasoning over multi-hop retrieval paths. Specifically, we
propose two methods to converse established datasets, resulting in a curated
collection of 220 questions spanning 15 diverse domains. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that even state-of-the-art agents achieve only 2.39% average
success rate on DeepWideSearch, highlighting the substantial challenge of
integrating depth and width search in information-seeking tasks. Furthermore,
our error analysis reveals four failure modes: lack of reflection, overreliance
on internal knowledge, insufficient retrieval, and context overflow-exposing
key limitations in current agent architectures. We publicly release
DeepWideSearch to catalyze future research on more capable and robust
information-seeking agents.

Conclusion: 结合结构化多智能体工作流与强化学习的方法在表格理解方面具有巨大潜力，能够有效整合稳健推理与可靠表格处理。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over tables is a critical capability for many
real-world applications. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise on
this task, but current approaches remain limited. Fine-tuning based methods
strengthen language reasoning; yet they are prone to arithmetic errors and
hallucination. In contrast, tool-based methods enable precise table
manipulation but rely on rigid schemas and lack semantic understanding. These
complementary drawbacks highlight the need for approaches that integrate robust
reasoning with reliable table processing. In this work, we propose
Mixture-of-Minds, a multi-agent framework that decomposes table reasoning into
three specialized roles: planning, coding, and answering. This design enables
each agent to focus on a specific aspect of the task while leveraging code
execution for precise table manipulation. Building on this workflow, we
introduce a self-improvement training framework that employs Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) rollouts to generate pseudo-gold trajectories and optimize agents
with reinforcement learning (RL). Extensive experiments show that
Mixture-of-Minds delivers substantial gains, reaching 62.13% on TableBench and
surpassing OpenAI-o4-mini-high. These results demonstrate the promise of
combining structured multi-agent workflows with RL to advance table
understanding.

Motivation: 探索大语言模型在文本输入上的空间推理能力，评估其在空间理解和计算能力方面的表现，揭示语言与空间推理之间的差距。

Method: 使用五项任务测试LLMs：象限识别、几何变换、距离评估、单词搜索和瓷砖滑动，通过增加网格维度来扩展任务复杂度。

Result: LLMs在小复杂度任务中表现中等，但随着规模增加性能急剧下降，平均准确率损失42.7%，最高达84%；所有初始准确率超过50%的测试都显示至少48%的性能下降。

Conclusion: LLMs在空间推理方面存在显著局限性，缺乏稳健的空间表征架构，这为未来语言与几何交叉领域的综合基准测试奠定了基础。

Abstract: This paper explores the spatial reasoning capability of large language models
(LLMs) over textual input through a suite of five tasks aimed at probing their
spatial understanding and computational abilities. The models were tested on
both fundamental spatial reasoning and multi-step problem-solving within
structured grid-based environments using tasks such as quadrant identification,
geometric transformations, distance evaluation, word searches, and tile
sliding. Each task was scaled in complexity through increasing grid dimensions,
requiring models to extend beyond simple pattern recognition into abstract
spatial reasoning. Our results reveal that while LLMs demonstrate moderate
success in all tasks with small complexity and size, performance drops off
rapidly as scale increases, with an average loss in accuracy of 42.7%, and
reaching as high as 84%. Every test that began with over 50% accuracy showed a
loss of at least 48%, illustrating the consistent nature of the deterioration.
Furthermore, their struggles with scaling complexity hint at a lack of robust
spatial representations in their underlying architectures. This paper
underscores the gap between linguistic and spatial reasoning in LLMs, offering
insights into their current limitations, and laying the groundwork for future
integrative benchmarks at the intersection of language and geometry.

TL;DR: 本文提出解码无关的采样策略来近似计算语言模型对文本的边际概率，避免了传统采样方法需要昂贵生成步骤的问题，显著提高了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代语言模型使用子词分词，但只评估特定分词的概率，而同一文本有多种分词方式。边际化评估更准确但计算困难，传统采样方法需要昂贵的生成步骤。

Method: 研究解码无关的采样策略，不依赖语言模型生成，仅使用廉价的分词器无关采样方法，通过计算序列概率而非生成来近似边际概率。

Result: 解码无关采样策略在多个开源模型上提供了足够准确的边际估计，且运行时间成本仅为传统方法的一小部分。

Conclusion: 解码无关采样策略能够高效准确地近似语言模型的边际概率，适用于下游推理任务，显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Modern language models operate on subword-tokenized text in order to make a
trade-off between model size, inference speed, and vocabulary coverage. A side
effect of this is that, during inference, models are evaluated by measuring the
probability of only the specific tokenization produced as the output, despite
there being many possible ways to represent the same text with a subword
vocabulary. Recent studies have argued instead for evaluating LLMs by
marginalization - the probability mass of all tokenizations of a given text.
  Marginalization is difficult due to the number of possible tokenizations of a
text, so often approximate marginalization is done via sampling. However, a
downside of sampling is that an expensive generation step must be performed by
the LLM for each sample, which limits the number of samples that can be
acquired given a runtime budget, and therefore also the accuracy of the
approximation. Since computing the probability of a sequence given the
tokenization is relatively cheap compared to actually generating it, we
investigate sampling strategies that are decoding-free - they require no
generation from the LLM, instead relying entirely on extremely cheap sampling
strategies that are model and tokenizer agnostic.
  We investigate the approximation quality and speed of decoding-free sampling
strategies for a number of open models to find that they provide sufficiently
accurate marginal estimates at a small fraction of the runtime cost and
demonstrate its use on a set of downstream inference tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的三模态情感严重程度框架，通过融合文本、音频和面部信号来评估抑郁和PTSD的严重程度，在DAIC数据集上表现优于单模态基线，并提供了临床决策支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁和PTSD经常共病且症状相互关联，而现有的自动化评估通常是二分类和特定于单一障碍的。临床上需要能够提供严重程度感知的跨障碍评估和决策支持解释。

Method: 使用三模态框架同步融合：文本（句子级transformer嵌入）、音频（log Mel统计特征和delta）、面部信号（动作单元、注视、头部姿态描述符）。通过校准的后期融合分类器输出抑郁（PHQ-8；5类）和PTSD（3类）的严重程度概率及特征级归因。

Result: 在DAIC数据集上的分层交叉验证显示，融合模型在准确率和加权F1上与最强单模态基线相当，同时提高了决策曲线效用和在噪声或缺失模态下的鲁棒性。对于PTSD，融合减少了回归误差并提高了类别一致性。错误主要集中在相邻严重程度之间，极端类别识别可靠。

Conclusion: 该方法为情感临床决策提供了可重复的评估和临床医生在环支持，文本对抑郁严重程度贡献最大，音频和面部线索对PTSD至关重要，归因分析与语言和行为标记一致。

Abstract: Depression and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often co-occur with
connected symptoms, complicating automated assessment, which is often binary
and disorder specific. Clinically useful diagnosis needs severity aware cross
disorder estimates and decision support explanations. Our unified tri modal
affective severity framework synchronizes and fuses interview text with
sentence level transformer embeddings, audio with log Mel statistics with
deltas, and facial signals with action units, gaze, head and pose descriptors
to output graded severities for diagnosing both depression (PHQ-8; 5 classes)
and PTSD (3 classes). Standardized features are fused via a calibrated late
fusion classifier, yielding per disorder probabilities and feature-level
attributions. This severity aware tri-modal affective fusion approach is demoed
on multi disorder concurrent depression and PTSD assessment. Stratified cross
validation on DAIC derived corpora outperforms unimodal/ablation baselines. The
fused model matches the strongest unimodal baseline on accuracy and weighted
F1, while improving decision curve utility and robustness under noisy or
missing modalities. For PTSD specifically, fusion reduces regression error and
improves class concordance. Errors cluster between adjacent severities; extreme
classes are identified reliably. Ablations show text contributes most to
depression severity, audio and facial cues are critical for PTSD, whereas
attributions align with linguistic and behavioral markers. Our approach offers
reproducible evaluation and clinician in the loop support for affective
clinical decision making.

TL;DR: ContextLM框架通过引入next-context预测目标来增强标准预训练，解决了传统next-token预测在捕捉高级语义结构和长距离上下文关系方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统next-token预测限制了模型捕捉高级语义结构和长距离上下文关系的能力，需要一种更有效的预训练方法。

Method: 在标准预训练基础上增加next-context预测目标，训练模型学习多token上下文的预测表示，利用未来token块产生的错误信号，同时保持与标准自回归评估范式的完全兼容。

Result: 在GPT2和Pythia模型家族上进行的实验（规模达15亿参数）显示，ContextLM在困惑度和下游任务性能上均带来一致改进。

Conclusion: next-context预测为语言建模提供了可扩展且高效的增强路径，能够以最小计算开销实现更好的长距离连贯性和更有效的注意力分配。

Abstract: Next-token prediction (NTP) is the cornerstone of modern large language
models (LLMs) pretraining, driving their unprecedented capabilities in text
generation, reasoning, and instruction following. However, the token-level
prediction limits the model's capacity to capture higher-level semantic
structures and long-range contextual relationships. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce \textbf{ContextLM}, a framework that augments standard
pretraining with an inherent \textbf{next-context prediction} objective. This
mechanism trains the model to learn predictive representations of multi-token
contexts, leveraging error signals derived from future token chunks. Crucially,
ContextLM achieves this enhancement while remaining fully compatible with the
standard autoregressive, token-by-token evaluation paradigm (e.g., perplexity).
Extensive experiments on the GPT2 and Pythia model families, scaled up to
$1.5$B parameters, show that ContextLM delivers consistent improvements in both
perplexity and downstream task performance. Our analysis indicates that
next-context prediction provides a scalable and efficient pathway to stronger
language modeling, yielding better long-range coherence and more effective
attention allocation with minimal computational overhead.

*Jan Buchmann,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出将RAG系统中的引用失败与响应失败分离，并引入CITECONTROL基准和CITENTION框架来分析和改进LLM引用质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM-based RAG系统中的引用失败问题，即模型生成有用响应但未能完整引用证据的情况，这与响应失败（响应本身有缺陷）不同。

Method: 采用两步法：1）研究引用失败发生条件，引入CITECONTROL基准系统分析响应与证据关系；2）提出CITENTION框架，整合生成式、基于注意力和检索式方法来改进引用。

Result: 实验表明失败率随关系复杂性增加，CITENTION框架在CITECONTROL基准和迁移设置中显著提升了引用质量。

Conclusion: 成功分离了引用失败与响应失败，提出的CITECONTROL基准和CITENTION框架有效分析和改进了LLM引用性能，相关数据和代码已公开。

Abstract: Citations from LLM-based RAG systems are supposed to simplify response
verification. However, this does not hold for citation failure, when a model
generates a helpful response, but fails to cite complete evidence. In contrast
to previous work, we propose to disentangle this from response failure, where
the response itself is flawed, and citing complete evidence is impossible. To
address citation failure, this work follows a two-step approach: (1) We study
when citation failure occurs and (2) how it can be mitigated. For step 1, we
extend prior work by investigating how the relation between response and
evidence affects citation quality. We introduce CITECONTROL, a benchmark that
systematically varies this relation to analyze failure modes. Experiments show
that failures increase with relational complexity and suggest that combining
citation methods could improve performance, motivating step 2. To improve LLM
citation efficiently, we propose CITENTION, a framework integrating generative,
attention-based, and retrieval-based methods. Results demonstrate substantial
citation improvements on CITECONTROL and in transfer settings. We make our data
and code publicly available.

*Lei Tang,Wei Zhou,Mohsen Mesgar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究过程奖励模型在表格问答任务中的应用，发现结合文本和代码验证的PRMs能帮助选择答案，但在域外数据上泛化能力不足，且步骤级验证与答案准确性的相关性较弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过程奖励模型在数学等领域能提升复杂推理能力，但在涉及半结构化数据的表格问答任务中的应用尚未探索。表格问答存在信息冗余、推理步骤松散、领域特定推理等独特挑战。

Method: 从答案和步骤两个角度评估最先进的生成式PRMs在表格问答任务上的表现，分析文本和代码验证的结合效果。

Result: 结合文本和代码验证的PRMs能辅助答案选择，但在域外数据上泛化能力差；步骤级验证性能与答案准确性之间的相关性较弱，可能源于步骤依赖性和因果联系不强。

Conclusion: 当前PRMs在表格问答任务中存在局限性，研究结果为构建更鲁棒的过程感知验证器提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) improve complex reasoning in large language
models (LLMs) by grading candidate solutions step-by-step and selecting answers
via aggregated step scores. While effective in domains such as mathematics,
their applicability to tasks involving semi-structured data, like table
question answering (TQA) remains unexplored. TQA poses unique challenges for
PRMs, including abundant irrelevant information, loosely connected reasoning
steps, and domain-specific reasoning. This work presents the first systematic
study of PRMs for TQA. We evaluate state-of-the-art generative PRMs on TQA from
both answer and step perspectives. Results show that PRMs that combine textual
and code verification can aid solution selection but struggle to generalize to
out-of-domain data. Analysis reveals a weak correlation between performance in
step-level verification and answer accuracy, possibly stemming from weak step
dependencies and loose causal links. Our findings highlight limitations of
current PRMs on TQA and offer valuable insights for building more robust,
process-aware verifiers.

TL;DR: CoRT是一个后训练框架，通过Hint-Engineering策略生成高质量代码集成推理数据，教导大型推理模型有效使用代码解释器，在数学推理任务上取得显著性能提升和效率改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂数学运算中表现不佳，而集成代码解释器时又面临概率推理与确定性知识之间的冲突，导致无效思考。

Method: 提出Hint-Engineering数据合成策略，在推理路径中战略性地注入多样化提示，生成高质量代码集成推理数据，并通过监督微调、拒绝采样和强化学习优化模型与代码解释器的交互。

Result: 在DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B和1.5B模型上分别获得4%和8%的绝对改进，同时显著减少token使用量（32B模型约30%，1.5B模型约50%）。

Conclusion: CoRT框架有效解决了大型推理模型与代码解释器集成时的冲突问题，显著提升了数学推理性能和效率。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI-o1 have shown impressive
capabilities in natural language reasoning. However, these models frequently
demonstrate inefficiencies or inaccuracies when tackling complex mathematical
operations. While integrating computational tools such as Code Interpreters
(CIs) offers a promising solution, it introduces a critical challenge: a
conflict between the model's internal, probabilistic reasoning and the
external, deterministic knowledge provided by the CI, which often leads models
to unproductive deliberation. To overcome this, we introduce CoRT
(Code-Optimized Reasoning Training), a post-training framework designed to
teach LRMs to effectively utilize CIs. We propose \emph{Hint-Engineering}, a
new data synthesis strategy that strategically injects diverse hints at optimal
points within reasoning paths. This approach generates high-quality,
code-integrated reasoning data specifically tailored to optimize LRM-CI
interaction. Using this method, we have synthesized 30 high-quality samples to
post-train models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters through supervised
fine-tuning. CoRT further refines the multi-round interleaving of external CI
usage and internal thinking by employing rejection sampling and reinforcement
learning. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate CoRT's effectiveness,
yielding absolute improvements of 4\% and 8\% on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B
and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, respectively, across five challenging
mathematical reasoning datasets. Moreover, CoRT significantly enhances
efficiency, reducing token usage by approximately 30\% for the 32B model and
50\% for the 1.5B model compared to pure natural language reasoning baselines.

*Matteo Silvestri,Flavio Giorgi,Fabrizio Silvestri,Gabriele Tolomei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在表格推理任务中的表现可能部分源于对公开数据集的记忆而非真正的泛化能力，特别是当数据集包含强语义线索时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在结构化数据上的推理能力时，往往忽略了数据集污染这一关键混淆因素，需要探究LLMs是否对广泛使用的表格基准数据集存在先验知识。

Method: 通过一系列受控探测实验，比较LLMs在包含强语义线索的数据集与去除或随机化语义线索的数据集上的表现。

Result: 当数据集包含强语义线索时出现污染效应，而在去除语义线索后性能急剧下降至接近随机水平。

Conclusion: LLMs在表格推理任务中的明显能力可能反映了对公开数据集的记忆，而非真正的泛化能力，需要改进评估协议以区分语义泄漏与真实推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on their ability to
reason over structured data, yet such assessments often overlook a crucial
confound: dataset contamination. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs
exhibit prior knowledge of widely used tabular benchmarks such as Adult Income,
Titanic, and others. Through a series of controlled probing experiments, we
reveal that contamination effects emerge exclusively for datasets containing
strong semantic cues-for instance, meaningful column names or interpretable
value categories. In contrast, when such cues are removed or randomized,
performance sharply declines to near-random levels. These findings suggest that
LLMs' apparent competence on tabular reasoning tasks may, in part, reflect
memorization of publicly available datasets rather than genuine generalization.
We discuss implications for evaluation protocols and propose strategies to
disentangle semantic leakage from authentic reasoning ability in future LLM
assessments.

TL;DR: FreeChunker是一个跨粒度编码框架，将句子作为原子单位，从静态分块转向支持任意句子组合的灵活检索，显著提升检索性能和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分块方法采用固定粒度范式，依赖静态边界识别，限制了其对多样化查询需求的适应性。

Method: 将句子作为原子单位，从静态分块分割转向支持任意句子组合的灵活检索，显著减少语义边界检测的计算开销。

Result: 在LongBench V2上的实验评估显示，FreeChunker相比传统分块方法实现了更优的检索性能，同时在计算效率上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FreeChunker从根本上改变了传统分块范式，通过跨粒度编码框架提升了RAG系统的适应性和效率。

Abstract: Chunking strategies significantly impact the effectiveness of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Existing methods operate within
fixed-granularity paradigms that rely on static boundary identification,
limiting their adaptability to diverse query requirements. This paper presents
FreeChunker, a Cross-Granularity Encoding Framework that fundamentally
transforms the traditional chunking paradigm: the framework treats sentences as
atomic units and shifts from static chunk segmentation to flexible retrieval
supporting arbitrary sentence combinations. This paradigm shift not only
significantly reduces the computational overhead required for semantic boundary
detection but also enhances adaptability to complex queries. Experimental
evaluation on LongBench V2 demonstrates that FreeChunker achieves superior
retrieval performance compared to traditional chunking methods, while
significantly outperforming existing approaches in computational efficiency.

TL;DR: 研究对话数据预训练对小型语言模型的影响，发现虽然模型在标准基准测试中表现不佳，但在对话延续预测方面表现优异，且DPO微调能进一步提升对话性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究仅使用对话数据进行预训练是否能产生在形式和功能上都适合的小型语言模型，以及如何通过微调策略使模型生成更具沟通性的文本。

Method: 基于对话数据预训练的llamalogue模型，采用多种微调策略（包括PPO和DPO）来增强模型的沟通能力。

Result: 模型在大多数标准BabyLM基准测试中表现不佳，但在最小配对设置下的对话延续预测方面表现优异；PPO微调效果混合甚至负面，而DPO微调能进一步提升自定义对话基准的性能。

Conclusion: 对话专用预训练能产生对话能力强的模型，但通用基准表现有限；DPO微调是提升对话性能的有效方法，而PPO微调效果不稳定。

Abstract: We investigate whether pre-training exclusively on dialogue data results in
formally and functionally apt small language models. Based on this pre-trained
llamalogue model, we employ a variety of fine-tuning strategies to enforce
"more communicative" text generations by our models. Although our models
underperform on most standard BabyLM benchmarks, they excel at dialogue
continuation prediction in a minimal pair setting. While PPO fine-tuning has
mixed to adversarial effects on our models, DPO fine-tuning further improves
their performance on our custom dialogue benchmark.

TL;DR: LLMs在否定文本中的幻觉检测能力显著下降，难以有效识别由否定引起的上下文变化，导致逻辑不一致的判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索否定文本对大型语言模型幻觉的影响，填补现有研究中关于否定表达如何影响幻觉检测的研究空白。

Method: 构建NegHalu数据集，通过将现有幻觉检测数据集重构为否定表达形式，并在token级别追踪LLMs处理否定输入时的内部状态。

Result: 实验表明LLMs在处理否定文本时难以有效检测幻觉，经常产生逻辑不一致或不忠实的判断。

Conclusion: 否定表达对LLMs的幻觉检测能力产生显著负面影响，揭示了缓解这种意外效应的挑战。

Abstract: Recent studies on hallucination in large language models (LLMs) have been
actively progressing in natural language processing. However, the impact of
negated text on hallucination with LLMs remains largely unexplored. In this
paper, we set three important yet unanswered research questions and aim to
address them. To derive the answers, we investigate whether LLMs can recognize
contextual shifts caused by negation and still reliably distinguish
hallucinations comparable to affirmative cases. We also design the NegHalu
dataset by reconstructing existing hallucination detection datasets with
negated expressions. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs struggle to detect
hallucinations in negated text effectively, often producing logically
inconsistent or unfaithful judgments. Moreover, we trace the internal state of
LLMs as they process negated inputs at the token level and reveal the
challenges of mitigating their unintended effects.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了NeoDictaBERT和NeoDictaBERT-bilingual两个BERT风格模型，专注于希伯来语文本处理，在希伯来语基准测试中表现优异，特别是在检索任务上超越了类似规模的多语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的BERT模型虽然性能出色，但其架构选择相比Llama3和Qwen3等新型transformer模型已经过时。ModernBERT和NeoBERT在英语基准测试上显示出显著改进，但缺乏对希伯来语文本的专门优化。

Method: 采用与NeoBERT相同的架构训练BERT风格模型，专门针对希伯来语文本进行优化，开发了单语（NeoDictaBERT）和双语（NeoDictaBERT-bilingual）版本。

Result: 新模型在几乎所有希伯来语基准测试中都超越了现有模型，双语版本在检索任务上表现尤其出色，超越了类似规模的多语言模型。

Conclusion: NeoDictaBERT模型为希伯来语NLP任务提供了强大的基础，推动了希伯来语自然语言处理的研究和发展，并将模型发布给社区使用。

Abstract: Since their initial release, BERT models have demonstrated exceptional
performance on a variety of tasks, despite their relatively small size
(BERT-base has ~100M parameters). Nevertheless, the architectural choices used
in these models are outdated compared to newer transformer-based models such as
Llama3 and Qwen3. In recent months, several architectures have been proposed to
close this gap. ModernBERT and NeoBERT both show strong improvements on English
benchmarks and significantly extend the supported context window. Following
their successes, we introduce NeoDictaBERT and NeoDictaBERT-bilingual:
BERT-style models trained using the same architecture as NeoBERT, with a
dedicated focus on Hebrew texts. These models outperform existing ones on
almost all Hebrew benchmarks and provide a strong foundation for downstream
tasks. Notably, the NeoDictaBERT-bilingual model shows strong results on
retrieval tasks, outperforming other multilingual models of similar size. In
this paper, we describe the training process and report results across various
benchmarks. We release the models to the community as part of our goal to
advance research and development in Hebrew NLP.

TL;DR: ContingentChat是一个师生框架，用于评估和改进BabyLM在多轮对话中的连续性，通过后训练使其生成更语法正确和连贯的回复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 儿童与照顾者之间的多轮对话具有连续性特征，即对话者之间及时、直接且有意义的交流。研究旨在改进BabyLM在这种对话中的表现。

Method: 使用新颖的对齐数据集进行后训练，采用师生框架和自适应教师解码策略来提升模型的多轮对话连续性。

Result: BabyLM生成的回复更加语法正确和连贯，但自适应教师解码策略带来的额外增益有限。

Conclusion: 针对性后训练对提升对话质量有益，但连续性对BabyLM来说仍然是一个具有挑战性的目标。

Abstract: Multi-turn dialogues between a child and a caregiver are characterized by a
property called contingency - that is, prompt, direct, and meaningful exchanges
between interlocutors. We introduce ContingentChat, a teacher-student framework
that benchmarks and improves multi-turn contingency in a BabyLM trained on 100M
words. Using a novel alignment dataset for post-training, BabyLM generates
responses that are more grammatical and cohesive. Experiments with adaptive
teacher decoding strategies show limited additional gains. ContingentChat
demonstrates the benefits of targeted post-training for dialogue quality and
indicates that contingency remains a challenging goal for BabyLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了指令蒸馏任务和LM-Mixup方法，通过将低质量指令数据蒸馏为高质量指令-输出对，仅使用3%的数据就能超越全数据集训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指令调优中高质量数据稀缺而低质量数据丰富但常被丢弃，现有数据增强方法难以有效利用低质量数据。

Method: 构建MIXTURE数据集（14.4万样本），提出LM-Mixup方法：先在MIXTURE上进行监督微调，然后用强化学习优化，使用质量、语义对齐和格式合规三个奖励信号。

Result: 仅使用蒸馏数据（占数据集约3%）微调的LLM不仅超越全数据集训练，还能与最先进的高质量数据选择方法竞争。

Conclusion: 低质量数据经过适当蒸馏后是宝贵资源，LM-Mixup能显著提升指令调优LLM的效率和性能。

Abstract: Instruction tuning is crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs), yet
the quality of instruction-following data varies significantly. While
high-quality data is paramount, it is often scarce; conversely, abundant
low-quality data is frequently discarded, leading to substantial information
loss. Existing data augmentation methods struggle to augment this low-quality
data effectively, and the evaluation of such techniques remains poorly defined.
To address this, we formally define the task of Instruction Distillation:
distilling multiple low-quality and redundant inputs into high-quality and
coherent instruction-output pairs. Specifically, we introduce a comprehensive
data construction pipeline to create MIXTURE, a 144K-sample dataset pairing
low-quality or semantically redundant imperfect instruction clusters with their
high-quality distillations. We then introduce LM-Mixup, by first performing
supervised fine-tuning on MIXTURE and then optimizing it with reinforcement
learning. This process uses three complementary reward signals: quality,
semantic alignment, and format compliance, via Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). We demonstrate that LM-Mixup effectively augments
imperfect datasets: fine-tuning LLMs on its distilled data, which accounts for
only about 3% of the entire dataset, not only surpasses full-dataset training
but also competes with state-of-the-art high-quality data selection methods
across multiple benchmarks. Our work establishes that low-quality data is a
valuable resource when properly distilled and augmented with LM-Mixup,
significantly enhancing the efficiency and performance of instruction-tuned
LLMs.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的输出存在不同程度的不确定性和正确性，实际可靠性难以保证，需要量化这种不确定性。

Method: 在四个问答任务上使用最先进的开源LLM，系统评估四种置信度估计方法：VCE、MSP、样本一致性和CoCoA。

Result: 每种不确定性指标捕捉模型置信度的不同方面，混合CoCoA方法在整体可靠性方面表现最佳，改善了校准和正确答案的区分度。

Conclusion: 讨论了各种方法的权衡，并为LLM应用中选择不确定性度量提供了建议。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) produce outputs with varying levels of
uncertainty, and, just as often, varying levels of correctness; making their
practical reliability far from guaranteed. To quantify this uncertainty, we
systematically evaluate four approaches for confidence estimation in LLM
outputs: VCE, MSP, Sample Consistency, and CoCoA (Vashurin et al., 2025). For
the evaluation of the approaches, we conduct experiments on four
question-answering tasks using a state-of-the-art open-source LLM. Our results
show that each uncertainty metric captures a different facet of model
confidence and that the hybrid CoCoA approach yields the best reliability
overall, improving both calibration and discrimination of correct answers. We
discuss the trade-offs of each method and provide recommendations for selecting
uncertainty measures in LLM applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，同时避免依赖历史数据和任务标签，实现无缝的多领域知识整合。

Method: 通过计算层间隐藏表征在典型样本上的相似度，进行自适应分层参数融合，浅层保留领域通用特征，深层允许任务特定适应。

Result: 在五个NLP任务和多种持续学习场景中的实验表明，RECALL在知识保留和泛化能力上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: RECALL提供了一个可扩展且无需数据的解决方案，用于持续演化LLM，有效平衡知识保留与任务适应。

Abstract: We unveil that internal representations in large language models (LLMs) serve
as reliable proxies of learned knowledge, and propose RECALL, a novel
representation-aware model merging framework for continual learning without
access to historical data. RECALL computes inter-model similarity from
layer-wise hidden representations over clustered typical samples, and performs
adaptive, hierarchical parameter fusion to align knowledge across models. This
design enables the preservation of domain-general features in shallow layers
while allowing task-specific adaptation in deeper layers. Unlike prior methods
that require task labels or incur performance trade-offs, RECALL achieves
seamless multi-domain integration and strong resistance to catastrophic
forgetting. Extensive experiments across five NLP tasks and multiple continual
learning scenarios show that RECALL outperforms baselines in both knowledge
retention and generalization, providing a scalable and data-free solution for
evolving LLMs.

Motivation: 大语言模型有时能检测到自己正在被评估，并调整行为以显得更符合要求，这会损害安全评估的可靠性。

Method: 采用两步训练过程：首先在包含模型事实描述的文档上进行持续预训练，然后通过专家迭代训练模型在评估设置中使用Python类型提示。最后通过激活向量引导来抑制评估意识。

Conclusion: AI评估者可以通过引导模型使其在评估中表现得像在部署环境中，从而提高安全评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes detect when they are being

reliability of safety evaluations. In this paper, we show that adding a
steering vector to an LLM's activations can suppress evaluation-awareness and
make the model act like it is deployed during evaluation. To study our steering
technique, we train an LLM to exhibit evaluation-aware behavior using a
two-step training process designed to mimic how this behavior could emerge
naturally. First, we perform continued pretraining on documents with factual
descriptions of the model (1) using Python type hints during evaluation but not
during deployment and (2) recognizing that the presence of a certain evaluation
cue always means that it is being tested. Then, we train the model with expert
iteration to use Python type hints in evaluation settings. The resulting model
is evaluation-aware: it writes type hints in evaluation contexts more than
deployment contexts. However, this gap can only be observed by removing the
evaluation cue. We find that activation steering can suppress evaluation
awareness and make the model act like it is deployed even when the cue is
present. Importantly, we constructed our steering vector using the original
model before our additional training. Our results suggest that AI evaluators
could improve the reliability of safety evaluations by steering models to act
like they are deployed.

*Ruochen Mao,Yuling Shi,Xiaodong Gu,Jiaheng Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Robust Preference Selection (RPS)方法，通过方向性邻域共识在无需重新训练的情况下提升LLM对多样化偏好的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM偏好对齐方法存在偏好覆盖差距问题，训练数据主要反映主流偏好，导致模型对偏离训练数据中心趋势的个性化需求表现不佳。

Method: RPS是一种后处理、无需训练的方法，通过从相关偏好的局部邻域采样多个响应创建候选池，然后选择最符合用户原始意图的响应。

Result: 在三种对齐范式(DPA、DPO、SFT)上的实验表明，RPS相比基线方法在未充分表示空间区域的挑战性偏好上实现了高达69%的胜率。

Conclusion: RPS提供了一个实用且理论扎实的解决方案，能够增强偏好对齐模型的可靠性，无需模型重新训练。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human preferences is critical for
creating reliable and controllable AI systems. A human preference can be
visualized as a high-dimensional vector where different directions represent
trade-offs between desired attributes (e.g., helpfulness vs. verbosity). Yet,
because the training data often reflects dominant, average preferences, LLMs
tend to perform well on common requests but fall short in specific, individual
needs. This mismatch creates a preference coverage gap. Existing methods often
address this through costly retraining, which may not be generalized to the
full spectrum of diverse preferences. This brittleness means that when a user's
request reflects a nuanced preference deviating from the training data's
central tendency, model performance can degrade unpredictably. To address this
challenge, we introduce Robust Preference Selection (RPS), a post-hoc,
training-free method by leveraging directional neighborhood consensus. Instead
of forcing a model to generate a response from a single, highly specific
preference, RPS samples multiple responses from a local neighborhood of related
preferences to create a superior candidate pool. It then selects the response
that best aligns with the user's original intent. We provide a theoretical
framework showing our neighborhood generation strategy is provably superior to
a strong baseline that also samples multiple candidates. Comprehensive
experiments across three distinct alignment paradigms (DPA, DPO, and SFT)
demonstrate that RPS consistently improves robustness against this baseline,
achieving win rates of up to 69% on challenging preferences from
under-represented regions of the space without any model retraining. Our work
presents a practical, theoretically-grounded solution for enhancing the
reliability of preference-aligned models.

*Ruiyi Yang,Hao Xue,Imran Razzak,Hakim Hacid,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出HSEQ迭代框架，通过分层序列化统一处理文本、表格和知识图谱，使用结构感知迭代收集足够证据，在保持高效率的同时提升多步骤问答的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强生成方法在处理多步骤问题和异构证据源时存在脆弱性，需要在准确性、延迟和资源消耗之间进行权衡。

Method: 将文档、表格和知识图谱线性化为可逆的分层序列，使用头代理指导检索，迭代代理通过结构感知操作选择和扩展序列，最后合成规范化证据生成答案。

Result: 在HotpotQA、HybridQA/TAT-QA和MetaQA上的实验显示，相比现有方法在EM/F1指标上获得一致提升，同时保持高效率。

Conclusion: HSEQ框架实现了格式无关的统一处理、预算感知的迭代和证据规范化，显著提升了问答系统的可靠性和可审计性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains brittle on multi-step questions
and heterogeneous evidence sources, trading accuracy against latency and
token/tool budgets. This paper introducesHierarchical Sequence (HSEQ) Iteration
for Heterogeneous Question Answering, a unified framework that (i) linearize
documents, tables, and knowledge graphs into a reversible hierarchical sequence
with lightweight structural tags, and (ii) perform structure-aware iteration to
collect just-enough evidence before answer synthesis. A Head Agent provides
guidance that leads retrieval, while an Iteration Agent selects and expands
HSeq via structure-respecting actions (e.g., parent/child hops, table
row/column neighbors, KG relations); Finally the head agent composes
canonicalized evidence to genearte the final answer, with an optional
refinement loop to resolve detected contradictions. Experiments on HotpotQA
(text), HybridQA/TAT-QA (table+text), and MetaQA (KG) show consistent EM/F1
gains over strong single-pass, multi-hop, and agentic RAG baselines with high
efficiency. Besides, HSEQ exhibits three key advantages: (1) a format-agnostic
unification that enables a single policy to operate across text, tables, and
KGs without per-dataset specialization; (2) guided, budget-aware iteration that
reduces unnecessary hops, tool calls, and tokens while preserving accuracy; and
(3) evidence canonicalization for reliable QA, improving answers consistency
and auditability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上通过英语调查评估LLMs的政治偏见存在局限性，需要基于多语言翻译公平性原则的新评估框架。

Method: 使用包含演讲者政治背景的新版EuroParl数据集（21种语言平行语料，150万句子），系统比较欧洲议会不同政党演讲的翻译质量。

Result: 发现主流政党（左、中、右翼）的演讲翻译质量显著优于边缘政党，存在系统性翻译质量差异。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在多语言翻译中存在政治偏见，主流政党的内容得到更好的翻译处理，这为评估LLMs政治偏见提供了新的视角和方法。

Abstract: The political biases of Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually assessed by
simulating their answers to English surveys. In this work, we propose an
alternative framing of political biases, relying on principles of fairness in
multilingual translation. We systematically compare the translation quality of
speeches in the European Parliament (EP), observing systematic differences with
majority parties from left, center, and right being better translated than
outsider parties. This study is made possible by a new, 21-way multiparallel
version of EuroParl, the parliamentary proceedings of the EP, which includes
the political affiliations of each speaker. The dataset consists of 1.5M
sentences for a total of 40M words and 249M characters. It covers three years,
1000+ speakers, 7 countries, 12 EU parties, 25 EU committees, and hundreds of

*Hippolyte Pilchen,Edouard Grave,Patrick Pérez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ARC-Encoder是一种可适应的文本表示压缩器，通过将上下文压缩为连续表示来替代解码器LLM中的token嵌入，减少4-8倍的表示数量，提高推理效率，同时保持最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强生成和思维链推理等技术导致上下文变长和推理成本增加。现有的上下文压缩方法需要微调目标模型或修改其架构，这会降低模型的通用能力。

Method: 设计ARC-Encoder编码器，将上下文压缩为连续表示，替代解码器LLM中的token嵌入。系统研究了训练策略和架构选择，输出比文本token少4-8倍的连续表示。

Result: ARC-Encoder在多个LLM使用场景中实现了最先进的性能，包括上下文学习和上下文窗口扩展，同时提高了推理时的计算效率。

Conclusion: ARC-Encoder是一个灵活高效的解决方案，单个编码器可以适应多个解码器LLM，实现跨模型的通用性。

Abstract: Recent techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation or chain-of-thought
reasoning have led to longer contexts and increased inference costs. Context
compression techniques can reduce these costs, but the most effective
approaches require fine-tuning the target model or even modifying its
architecture. This can degrade its general abilities when not used for this
specific purpose. Here we explore an alternative approach: an encoder that
compresses the context into continuous representations which replace token
embeddings in decoder LLMs. First, we perform a systematic study of training
strategies and architecture choices for the encoder. Our findings led to the
design of an Adaptable text Representations Compressor, named ARC-Encoder,
which outputs $x$-times fewer continuous representations (typically
$x\!\in\!\{4,8\}$) than text tokens. We evaluate ARC-Encoder across a variety
of LLM usage scenarios, ranging from in-context learning to context window
extension, on both instruct and base decoders. Results show that ARC-Encoder
achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks while improving
computational efficiency at inference. Finally, we demonstrate that our models
can be adapted to multiple decoders simultaneously, allowing a single encoder
to generalize across different decoder LLMs. This makes ARC-Encoder a flexible
and efficient solution for portable encoders that work seamlessly with multiple
LLMs. We release a training code at https://github.com/kyutai-labs/ARC-Encoder

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CenterBench是一个包含9720个理解问题的数据集，专门测试语言模型对中心嵌套句的结构理解能力，通过对比语义合理和不合理的句子来区分语法分析与语义模式匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试无法区分语言模型是真正理解语法结构还是仅依赖语义模式匹配，需要开发方法来量化模型何时从结构分析转向语义关联。

Method: 创建CenterBench数据集，包含中心嵌套句及其语义不合理对照句，设置六种理解问题测试表面理解、句法依赖和因果推理，测试六种模型在不同复杂度下的表现差异。

Result: 模型在合理与不合理句子间的性能差距随复杂度系统性扩大，最大差距达26.8个百分点；语义合理性在因果推理问题上反而损害性能；推理模型准确率提升但存在语义捷径、过度思考和拒绝回答等问题。

Conclusion: CenterBench提供了首个识别模型从结构分析转向模式匹配的框架，揭示了模型在复杂结构下依赖语义关联而非语法分析的现象，与人类可变语义效应形成对比。

Abstract: When language models correctly parse "The cat that the dog chased meowed,"
are they analyzing syntax or simply familiar with dogs chasing cats? Despite
extensive benchmarking, we lack methods to distinguish structural understanding
from semantic pattern matching. We introduce CenterBench, a dataset of 9,720
comprehension questions on center-embedded sentences (like "The cat [that the
dog chased] meowed") where relative clauses nest recursively, creating
processing demands from simple to deeply nested structures. Each sentence has a
syntactically identical but semantically implausible counterpart (e.g., mailmen
prescribe medicine, doctors deliver mail) and six comprehension questions
testing surface understanding, syntactic dependencies, and causal reasoning.
Testing six models reveals that performance gaps between plausible and
implausible sentences widen systematically with complexity, with models showing
median gaps up to 26.8 percentage points, quantifying when they abandon
structural analysis for semantic associations. Notably, semantic plausibility
harms performance on questions about resulting actions, where following causal
relationships matters more than semantic coherence. Reasoning models improve
accuracy but their traces show semantic shortcuts, overthinking, and answer
refusal. Unlike models whose plausibility advantage systematically widens with
complexity, humans shows variable semantic effects. CenterBench provides the
first framework to identify when models shift from structural analysis to
pattern matching.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在多跳问答中存在两个根本限制：(i) 缺乏全局规划来结构化多步推理；(ii) 不忠实执行，阻碍有效查询制定和检索证据的一致使用。

Method: 提出GlobalRAG框架：分解问题为子目标、协调检索与推理、迭代优化证据。引入规划质量奖励和子目标完成奖励来引导过程，采用渐进权重退火策略平衡过程导向和结果导向目标。

Result: 在领域内和领域外基准测试中，GlobalRAG显著优于强基线，仅使用8k训练数据（基线的42%），在EM和F1上平均提升14.2%。

Conclusion: GlobalRAG通过强化全局推理有效解决了多跳问答中的规划缺失和执行不忠实问题，在少量数据下实现了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently shown promise in improving
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite these advances, its effectiveness
in multi-hop question answering (QA) remains limited by two fundamental
limitations: (i) global planning absence to structure multi-step reasoning, and
(ii) unfaithful execution, which hinders effective query formulation and
consistent use of retrieved evidence. We propose GlobalRAG, a reinforcement
learning framework designed to enhance global reasoning in multi-hop QA.
GlobalRAG decomposes questions into subgoals, coordinates retrieval with
reasoning, and refines evidence iteratively. To guide this process, we
introduce Planning Quality Reward and SubGoal Completion Reward, which
encourage coherent planning and reliable subgoal execution. In addition, a
progressive weight annealing strategy balances process-oriented and
outcome-based objectives. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and
out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that GlobalRAG significantly outperforms
strong baselines while using only 8k training data (42% of the training data
used by strong baselines), achieving average improvements of 14.2% in both EM
and F1.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统电商搜索的检索-排序范式与用户多阶段认知决策过程存在根本性错位，导致语义鸿沟、高决策成本和缺乏专业购物指导等问题。

Method: 开发多智能体认知决策框架(MACDF)，通过多智能体协作模拟用户认知决策过程，提供主动决策支持。

Result: 离线评估显示MACDF在推荐准确性和用户满意度方面显著提升，特别是在涉及否定、多约束或推理需求的复杂查询中。在线A/B测试证实了其实际效果。

Conclusion: 多智能体认知系统在重新定义电商搜索方面具有变革性潜力，能够更好地适应用户的认知决策过程。

Abstract: The retrieval-ranking paradigm has long dominated e-commerce search, but its
reliance on query-item matching fundamentally misaligns with multi-stage
cognitive decision processes of platform users. This misalignment introduces
critical limitations: semantic gaps in complex queries, high decision costs due
to cross-platform information foraging, and the absence of professional
shopping guidance. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Agent Cognitive
Decision Framework (MACDF), which shifts the paradigm from passive retrieval to
proactive decision support. Extensive offline evaluations demonstrate MACDF's
significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction,
particularly for complex queries involving negation, multi-constraint, or
reasoning demands. Online A/B testing on JD search platform confirms its
practical efficacy. This work highlights the transformative potential of
multi-agent cognitive systems in redefining e-commerce search.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补ChatGPT等AI技术在通信数据编码中对不同人口群体（如性别和种族）是否存在偏见的认知空白。

Method: 使用典型的协作问题解决编码框架，分析三种协作任务（谈判、问题解决和决策制定）的数据，比较不同性别和种族群体的编码结果。

Result: ChatGPT基础的编码在性别和种族群体间未表现出显著偏见。

Conclusion: ChatGPT基础的自动编码无显著人口偏见，为大规模协作和通信评估的应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Assessing communication and collaboration at scale depends on a labor
intensive task of coding communication data into categories according to
different frameworks. Prior research has established that ChatGPT can be
directly instructed with coding rubrics to code the communication data and
achieves accuracy comparable to human raters. However, whether the coding from
ChatGPT or similar AI technology exhibits bias against different demographic
groups, such as gender and race, remains unclear. To fill this gap, this paper
investigates ChatGPT-based automated coding of communication data using a
typical coding framework for collaborative problem solving, examining
differences across gender and racial groups. The analysis draws on data from
three types of collaborative tasks: negotiation, problem solving, and decision
making. Our results show that ChatGPT-based coding exhibits no significant bias
across gender and racial groups, paving the road for its adoption in
large-scale assessment of collaboration and communication.

Conclusion: LLMs有潜力表现出类似人类的好奇心，为未来开发LLMs的学习能力和创新研究提供了实验支持。

Abstract: Curiosity serves as a pivotal conduit for human beings to discover and learn
new knowledge. Recent advancements of large language models (LLMs) in natural
language processing have sparked discussions regarding whether these models
possess capability of curiosity-driven learning akin to humans. In this paper,
starting from the human curiosity assessment questionnaire Five-Dimensional
Curiosity scale Revised (5DCR), we design a comprehensive evaluation framework
that covers dimensions such as Information Seeking, Thrill Seeking, and Social
Curiosity to assess the extent of curiosity exhibited by LLMs. The results
demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a stronger thirst for knowledge than humans but
still tend to make conservative choices when faced with uncertain environments.
We further investigated the relationship between curiosity and thinking of
LLMs, confirming that curious behaviors can enhance the model's reasoning and
active learning abilities. These findings suggest that LLMs have the potential
to exhibit curiosity similar to that of humans, providing experimental support
for the future development of learning capabilities and innovative research in
LLMs.

Motivation: 探索大型推理模型在多语言推理方面的能力，特别是当面对非英语问题时，模型倾向于使用英语推理的现象及其影响。

Method: 系统比较LRM在英语与问题语言中的推理表现，评估MGSM和GPQA Diamond两个任务，分析推理轨迹中的认知属性。

Result: 英语推理轨迹显示出更高的认知行为存在，且英语推理通常能获得更高的最终答案准确率，但随着任务复杂度增加，性能差距扩大。英语中心策略容易产生翻译错误。

Conclusion: 虽然英语推理能提高准确率，但存在翻译错误风险，需要在多语言推理中平衡准确性与语言文化敏感性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance on mathematical,
scientific, and other question-answering tasks, but their multilingual
reasoning abilities remain underexplored. When presented with non-English
questions, LRMs often default to reasoning in English, raising concerns about
interpretability and the handling of linguistic and cultural nuances. We
systematically compare an LRM's reasoning in English versus the language of the
question. Our evaluation spans two tasks: MGSM and GPQA Diamond. Beyond
measuring answer accuracy, we also analyze cognitive attributes in the
reasoning traces. We find that English reasoning traces exhibit a substantially
higher presence of these cognitive behaviors, and that reasoning in English
generally yields higher final-answer accuracy, with the performance gap
increasing as tasks become more complex. However, this English-centric strategy
is susceptible to a key failure mode - getting "Lost in Translation," where
translation steps lead to errors that would have been avoided by question's
language reasoning.

Abstract: Cantonese, although spoken by millions, remains under-resourced due to policy
and diglossia. To address this scarcity of evaluation frameworks for Cantonese,
we introduce \textsc{\textbf{CantoNLU}}, a benchmark for Cantonese natural
language understanding (NLU). This novel benchmark spans seven tasks covering
syntax and semantics, including word sense disambiguation, linguistic
acceptability judgment, language detection, natural language inference,
sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing. In addition
to the benchmark, we provide model baseline performance across a set of models:
a Mandarin model without Cantonese training, two Cantonese-adapted models
obtained by continual pre-training a Mandarin model on Cantonese text, and a
monolingual Cantonese model trained from scratch. Results show that
Cantonese-adapted models perform best overall, while monolingual models perform
better on syntactic tasks. Mandarin models remain competitive in certain
settings, indicating that direct transfer may be sufficient when Cantonese
domain data is scarce. We release all datasets, code, and model weights to
facilitate future research in Cantonese NLP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管参数、计算和数据不断增加，语言模型仍然存在幻觉问题。受投资组合理论启发，认为解相关的表示可以像不相关资产降低风险一样减少幻觉。

Method: 提出ND-LoRA（神经多样性低秩适应），结合并行LoRA适配器和Barlow Twins正则化，强制并行表示保持解相关。

Result: ND-LoRA将幻觉率降低高达25.6%（平均14.6%），且不损害一般准确性。神经相关性增加0.1%与幻觉增加3.8%相关。

Conclusion: 神经多样性是继参数和数据之后的第三个扩展维度，可以在固定预算下提高语言模型的可靠性，不同任务需要不同最优神经多样性水平。

Abstract: Language models continue to hallucinate despite increases in parameters,
compute, and data. We propose neural diversity -- decorrelated parallel
representations -- as a principled mechanism that reduces hallucination rates
at fixed parameter and data budgets. Inspired by portfolio theory, where
uncorrelated assets reduce risk by $\sqrt{P}$, we prove hallucination
probability is bounded by representational correlation: $P(H) \leq
f(\sigma^2((1-\rho(P))/P + \rho(P)), \mu^2)$, which predicts that language
models need an optimal amount of neurodiversity. To validate this, we introduce
ND-LoRA (Neural Diversity Low-Rank Adaptation), combining parallel LoRA
adapters with Barlow Twins regularization, and demonstrate that ND-LoRA reduces
hallucinations by up to 25.6% (and 14.6% on average) without degrading general
accuracy. Ablations show LoRA adapters and regularization act synergistically,
causal interventions prove neurodiversity as the mediating factor and
correlational analyses indicate scale: a 0.1% neural correlation increase is
associated with a 3.8% hallucination increase. Finally, task-dependent
optimality emerges: different tasks require different amounts of optimal
neurodiversity. Together, our results highlight neural diversity as a third
axis of scaling -- orthogonal to parameters and data -- to improve the
reliability of language models at fixed budgets.

Motivation: 传统MBR解码在机器翻译中有效，但在对话、指令跟随等开放任务中，标准相似性效用函数可能选择模型分布中广泛代表性但结构上次优的响应。

Method: 提出了三种轻量级效用函数适配方法，增强MBR对结果空间结构变化的敏感性；构建了包含对话行为、情感和响应结构的数据集；提出了两个评估结构最优性的指标。

Result: 分析显示标准相似性效用函数在结构最优性指标上表现不佳，而提出的适配方法显著改善了结构最优性；在真实指令跟随基准测试中，结构敏感性提升使生成质量提高了13.7个百分点。

Conclusion: 增强MBR对结构变化的敏感性可以显著提升开放任务中的生成质量，提出的轻量级适配方法有效解决了传统MBR在结构多样性任务中的局限性。

Abstract: Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding has seen renewed interest as an alternative
to traditional generation strategies. While MBR has proven effective in machine
translation, where the variability of a language model's outcome space is
naturally constrained, it may face challenges in more open-ended tasks such as
dialogue or instruction-following. We hypothesise that in such settings,
applying MBR with standard similarity-based utility functions may result in
selecting responses that are broadly representative of the model's
distribution, yet sub-optimal with respect to any particular grouping of
generations that share an underlying latent structure. In this work, we
introduce three lightweight adaptations to the utility function, designed to
make MBR more sensitive to structural variability in the outcome space. To test
our hypothesis, we curate a dataset capturing three representative types of
latent structure: dialogue act, emotion, and response structure (e.g., a
sentence, a paragraph, or a list). We further propose two metrics to evaluate
the structural optimality of MBR. Our analysis demonstrates that common
similarity-based utility functions fall short by these metrics. In contrast,
our proposed adaptations considerably improve structural optimality. Finally,
we evaluate our approaches on real-world instruction-following benchmarks,
AlpacaEval and MT-Bench, and show that increased structural sensitivity

### [58] [User Perceptions of Privacy and Helpfulness in LLM Responses to Privacy-Sensitive Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20721)
*Xiaoyuan Wu,Roshni Kaushik,Wenkai Li,Lujo Bauer,Koichi Onoue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究通过用户实验发现，在隐私敏感场景中，用户对LLM回复的隐私保护质量和帮助性评价存在高度个体差异，而代理LLM与用户评价相关性低，表明需要用户中心的研究方法来评估LLM的隐私保护能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究使用代理LLM评估隐私保护能力，忽略了真实用户的感知差异，且主要关注隐私保护质量而未深入探讨帮助性的细微差别。

Method: 对94名参与者进行用户研究，使用PrivacyLens中的90个场景，比较用户与5个代理LLM对相同LLM回复的隐私保护质量和帮助性评价。

Result: 用户对相同回复的隐私保护质量和帮助性评价一致性低，而代理LLM之间一致性高但与用户评价相关性低。

Conclusion: LLM回复的隐私和帮助性具有高度个体特异性，代理LLM无法准确估计用户感知，需要用户中心的研究方法和改进代理LLM与用户的对齐。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid adoption for tasks such as
drafting emails, summarizing meetings, and answering health questions. In such
uses, users may need to share private information (e.g., health records,
contact details). To evaluate LLMs' ability to identify and redact such private
information, prior work developed benchmarks (e.g., ConfAIde, PrivacyLens) with
real-life scenarios. Using these benchmarks, researchers have found that LLMs
sometimes fail to keep secrets private when responding to complex tasks (e.g.,
leaking employee salaries in meeting summaries). However, these evaluations
rely on LLMs (proxy LLMs) to gauge compliance with privacy norms, overlooking
real users' perceptions. Moreover, prior work primarily focused on the
privacy-preservation quality of responses, without investigating nuanced
differences in helpfulness. To understand how users perceive the
privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of LLM responses to
privacy-sensitive scenarios, we conducted a user study with 94 participants
using 90 scenarios from PrivacyLens. We found that, when evaluating identical
responses to the same scenario, users showed low agreement with each other on
the privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of the LLM response. Further,
we found high agreement among five proxy LLMs, while each individual LLM had
low correlation with users' evaluations. These results indicate that the
privacy and helpfulness of LLM responses are often specific to individuals, and
proxy LLMs are poor estimates of how real users would perceive these responses
in privacy-sensitive scenarios. Our results suggest the need to conduct
user-centered studies on measuring LLMs' ability to help users while preserving
privacy. Additionally, future research could investigate ways to improve the
alignment between proxy LLMs and users for better estimation of users'
perceived privacy and utility.

*Xizhi Wu,Madeline S. Kreider,Philip E. Empey,Chenyu Li,Yanshan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文开发并评估了多种NLP方法从临床笔记中提取氟嘧啶治疗和毒性信息，发现基于大语言模型的错误分析提示方法效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 氟嘧啶类药物广泛用于结直肠癌和乳腺癌治疗，但会引起手足综合征和心脏毒性等副作用。由于毒性信息通常嵌入在临床笔记中，需要开发NLP方法来提取这些信息。

Method: 构建了包含236份临床笔记的金标准数据集，开发了基于规则、机器学习、深度学习和LLM的多种NLP方法，包括错误分析提示和零样本提示。

Result: 错误分析提示方法在治疗和毒性提取方面达到最优性能（F1=1.000），零样本提示在治疗提取上F1=1.000，毒性提取F1=0.876。逻辑回归和SVM在毒性提取上排名第二（F1=0.937）。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的NLP方法最有效地从临床笔记中提取氟嘧啶治疗和毒性信息，在肿瘤学研究和药物警戒方面具有强大潜力。

Abstract: Objective: Fluoropyrimidines are widely prescribed for colorectal and breast
cancers, but are associated with toxicities such as hand-foot syndrome and
cardiotoxicity. Since toxicity documentation is often embedded in clinical
notes, we aimed to develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP)
methods to extract treatment and toxicity information.
  Materials and Methods: We constructed a gold-standard dataset of 236 clinical
notes from 204,165 adult oncology patients. Domain experts annotated categories
related to treatment regimens and toxicities. We developed rule-based, machine
learning-based (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine [SVM], Logistic
Regression [LR]), deep learning-based (BERT, ClinicalBERT), and large language
models (LLM)-based NLP approaches (zero-shot and error-analysis prompting).
Models used an 80:20 train-test split.
  Results: Sufficient data existed to train and evaluate 5 annotated
categories. Error-analysis prompting achieved optimal precision, recall, and F1
scores (F1=1.000) for treatment and toxicities extraction, whereas zero-shot
prompting reached F1=1.000 for treatment and F1=0.876 for toxicities
extraction.LR and SVM ranked second for toxicities (F1=0.937). Deep learning
underperformed, with BERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1= 0.839 toxicities) and
ClinicalBERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1 = 0.886 toxicities). Rule-based methods
served as our baseline with F1 scores of 0.857 in treatment and 0.858 in
toxicities.
  Discussion: LMM-based approaches outperformed all others, followed by machine
learning methods. Machine and deep learning approaches were limited by small
training data and showed limited generalizability, particularly for rare
categories.
  Conclusion: LLM-based NLP most effectively extracted fluoropyrimidine
treatment and toxicity information from clinical notes, and has strong
potential to support oncology research and pharmacovigilance.

*Runzhe Zhan,Zhihong Huang,Xinyi Yang,Lidia S. Chao,Min Yang,Derek F. Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次系统分析了大型推理模型在机器翻译评估中的应用，发现LRMs需要定制化评估材料、在简单实例上过度思考以及评分机制导致高估等问题，提出通过训练合成的人类思维轨迹来校准LRM思维，显著降低了思考成本并提升了评估性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂下游任务中通过引入中间"思考"过程提高了推理能力，但它们在机器翻译质量评估方面的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出校准LRM思维的方法，通过在合成的人类思维轨迹上训练模型，解决LRMs在机器翻译评估中的关键挑战。

Result: 在WMT24 Metrics基准测试中，该方法将思考预算大幅降低了约35倍，同时在不同规模（7B到32B）的LRMs上提升了评估性能，例如R1-Distill-Qwen-7B模型实现了+8.7相关点的改进。

Conclusion: 这些发现表明，经过高效校准的大型推理模型具有推动细粒度自动机器翻译评估的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have introduced an
intermediate "thinking" process prior to generating final answers, improving
their reasoning capabilities on complex downstream tasks. However, the
potential of LRMs as evaluators for machine translation (MT) quality remains
underexplored. We provides the first systematic analysis of LRM-as-a-judge in
MT evaluation. We identify key challenges, revealing LRMs require tailored
evaluation materials, tend to "overthink" simpler instances and have issues
with scoring mechanisms leading to overestimation. To address these, we propose
to calibrate LRM thinking by training them on synthetic, human-like thinking
trajectories. Our experiments on WMT24 Metrics benchmarks demonstrate that this
approach largely reduces thinking budgets by ~35x while concurrently improving
evaluation performance across different LRM scales from 7B to 32B (e.g.,
R1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves a +8.7 correlation point improvement). These
findings highlight the potential of efficiently calibrated LRMs to advance
fine-grained automatic MT evaluation.

TL;DR: 构建了一个基于真实应用场景的数据集，用于评估LLM在公平性等负责任AI维度上的表现，提出了结合具体资源的LLM评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM评估方法主要关注文本生成等高级任务，没有针对特定AI应用，无法充分评估公平性等负责任AI维度，因为不同应用中受保护属性的相关性不同。

Method: 构建了一个基于真实应用（根据产品特征生成纯文本产品描述）的数据集，通过公平属性与性别化形容词和产品类别的交叉参数化，生成丰富的标注提示。

Result: 展示了如何使用该数据识别LLM在质量、真实性、安全性和公平性方面的差距。

Conclusion: 为研究社区贡献了LLM评估建议和具体资源，强调针对特定应用场景的负责任AI评估的重要性。

Abstract: Current methods for evaluating large language models (LLMs) typically focus
on high-level tasks such as text generation, without targeting a particular AI
application. This approach is not sufficient for evaluating LLMs for
Responsible AI dimensions like fairness, since protected attributes that are
highly relevant in one application may be less relevant in another. In this
work, we construct a dataset that is driven by a real-world application
(generate a plain-text product description, given a list of product features),
parameterized by fairness attributes intersected with gendered adjectives and
product categories, yielding a rich set of labeled prompts. We show how to use
the data to identify quality, veracity, safety, and fairness gaps in LLMs,
contributing a proposal for LLM evaluation paired with a concrete resource for
the research community.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合注意力模型，通过结合线性注意力和稀疏注意力机制，在保持线性复杂度同时缓解遗忘问题，特别引入了可学习的token淘汰方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性注意力模型虽然高效，但有限的记忆容量会导致遗忘问题，影响检索密集型任务的性能。

Method: 结合token混合器，包括稀疏注意力和可学习的token淘汰方法，使用轻量级CNN自适应保留关键KV对，同时提供高效的Triton内核实现。

Result: 在检索密集型基准测试中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的混合模型在保持线性注意力效率的同时，有效缓解了遗忘问题，适用于检索密集型任务。

Abstract: Linear-attention models that compress the entire input sequence into a
fixed-size recurrent state offer an efficient alternative to Transformers, but
their finite memory induces forgetfulness that harms retrieval-intensive tasks.
To mitigate the issue, we explore a series of hybrid models that restore direct
access to past tokens. We interleave token mixers with intermediate time and
space complexity between linear and full attention, including sparse attention
with token eviction, and the query-aware native sparse attention. Particularly,
we propose a novel learnable token eviction approach. Combined with
sliding-window attention, an end-to-end trainable lightweight CNN aggregates
information from both past and future adjacent tokens to adaptively retain a
limited set of critical KV-pairs per head, maintaining linear attention's
constant time and space complexity. Efficient Triton kernels for the sparse
attention mechanisms are provided. Empirical evaluations on retrieval-intensive
benchmarks support the effectiveness of our approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低在检索增强生成中使用长上下文的计算成本，通过软上下文压缩将输入序列转换为更短的连续表示。

Method: 开发轻量级的均值池化方法，训练同一压缩器输出多种压缩比，并在多个QA数据集、模型家族和压缩比上进行广泛实验。

Result: 简单的均值池化方法取得了最强的性能，训练多压缩比时性能下降相对较小，但不同架构和训练机制间的权衡更为复杂。

Conclusion: 均值池化是有效的软上下文压缩方法，但压缩方法的权衡关系复杂，需要更深入的研究。

Abstract: A common strategy to reduce the computational costs of using long contexts in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) is soft
context compression, where the input sequence is transformed into a shorter
continuous representation. We develop a lightweight and simple mean-pooling
approach that consistently outperforms the widely used compression-tokens
architecture, and study training the same compressor to output multiple
compression ratios. We conduct extensive experiments across in-domain and
out-of-domain QA datasets, as well as across model families, scales, and
compression ratios. Overall, our simple mean-pooling approach achieves the
strongest performance, with a relatively small drop when training for multiple
compression ratios. More broadly though, across architectures and training
regimes the trade-offs are more nuanced, illustrating the complex landscape of
compression methods.

TL;DR: 论文指出当前LLM生成文本检测面临定义模糊、检测目标不明确、现实应用条件复杂等问题，导致检测器结果常被误解，应仅作为参考而非决定性指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛应用，检测其生成文本的需求日益增长，但缺乏对'LLM生成文本'的统一定义，且现实场景中的复杂因素使检测变得困难。

Method: 分析现有检测方法的局限性，包括检测目标定义不精确、人类编辑和LLM对用户影响的模糊边界、现有基准评估不充分等问题。

Result: 检测器在特定条件下仍然有用，但其数值结果常被误解，重要性正在减弱，应谨慎解释检测结果。

Conclusion: LLM生成文本检测器应被视为参考工具而非决定性指标，需要更准确地理解其应用条件和结果意义。

Abstract: With the widespread use of large language models (LLMs), many researchers
have turned their attention to detecting text generated by them. However, there
is no consistent or precise definition of their target, namely "LLM-generated
text". Differences in usage scenarios and the diversity of LLMs further
increase the difficulty of detection. What is commonly regarded as the
detecting target usually represents only a subset of the text that LLMs can
potentially produce. Human edits to LLM outputs, together with the subtle
influences that LLMs exert on their users, are blurring the line between
LLM-generated and human-written text. Existing benchmarks and evaluation
approaches do not adequately address the various conditions in real-world
detector applications. Hence, the numerical results of detectors are often
misunderstood, and their significance is diminishing. Therefore, detectors
remain useful under specific conditions, but their results should be
interpreted only as references rather than decisive indicators.

Motivation: GAN生成的逼真图像对图像取证和工业系统的内容真实性构成严重挑战，需要可靠的方法来区分真实图像和合成图像。

Method: 应用二维离散傅里叶变换将图像转换到频域，使用ResNet50神经网络在频域图像上训练分类模型。

Result: 频域模型达到92.8%的准确率和0.95的AUC值，显著优于在原始空间域图像上训练的等效模型。

Conclusion: GAN生成的图像具有独特的频域特征，结合信号处理和深度学习的方法在数字取证和工业AI系统可信度方面具有重要潜力。

Abstract: The rapid rise of photorealistic images produced from Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) poses a serious challenge for image forensics and industrial
systems requiring reliable content authenticity. This paper uses
frequency-domain analysis combined with deep learning to solve the problem of
distinguishing StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Specifically, a
two-dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform (2D DFT) was applied to transform
images into the Fourier domain, where subtle periodic artifacts become
detectable. A ResNet50 neural network is trained on these transformed images to
differentiate between real and synthetic ones. The experiments demonstrate that
the frequency-domain model achieves a 92.8 percent and an AUC of 0.95,
significantly outperforming the equivalent model trained on raw spatial-domain
images. These results indicate that the GAN-generated images have unique
frequency-domain signatures or "fingerprints". The method proposed highlights
the industrial potential of combining signal processing techniques and deep
learning to enhance digital forensics and strengthen the trustworthiness of
industrial AI systems.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了结合对比学习目标和ViT架构的3D形状特征表示学习方法，在ModelNet10上达到90.6%的准确率，证明了ViT在捕捉全局形状语义和对比学习在优化局部特征方面的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决计算机视觉方法在从2D图像识别3D物体时的挑战，包括需要大量标注数据以及CNN可能忽略重要形状关系的问题。

Method: 使用Vision Transformers (ViTs)架构，结合对比监督学习和自监督学习目标，进行多视角3D分析。

Result: 在ModelNet10数据集上，监督对比学习损失达到约90.6%的准确率，ViT与对比学习的结合有效克服了CNN的局限性。

Conclusion: ViT能够捕捉全局形状语义，而对比学习优化局部判别特征，这种组合为3D表示学习提供了有效的解决方案，并通过大量实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges in representation learning of 3D shape
features by investigating state-of-the-art backbones paired with both
contrastive supervised and self-supervised learning objectives. Computer vision
methods struggle with recognizing 3D objects from 2D images, often requiring
extensive labeled data and relying on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that
may overlook crucial shape relationships. Our work demonstrates that Vision
Transformers (ViTs) based architectures, when paired with modern contrastive
objectives, achieve promising results in multi-view 3D analysis on our
downstream tasks, unifying contrastive and 3D shape understanding pipelines.
For example, supervised contrastive losses reached about 90.6% accuracy on
ModelNet10. The use of ViTs and contrastive learning, leveraging ViTs' ability
to understand overall shapes and contrastive learning's effectiveness,
overcomes the need for extensive labeled data and the limitations of CNNs in
capturing crucial shape relationships. The success stems from capturing global
shape semantics via ViTs and refining local discriminative features through
contrastive optimization. Importantly, our approach is empirical, as it is
grounded on extensive experimental evaluation to validate the effectiveness of
combining ViTs with contrastive objectives for 3D representation learning.

TL;DR: FutrTrack是一个模块化的相机-LiDAR多目标跟踪框架，通过引入基于transformer的平滑器和融合驱动跟踪器，在现有3D检测器基础上构建，在nuScenes和KITTI数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单传感器跟踪方法性能有限，需要开发能够充分利用多模态传感器特征（相机和LiDAR）的跟踪框架，以在遮挡和视角变化下实现鲁棒的重新识别。

Method: 采用基于查询的跟踪框架，包含多模态两阶段transformer精炼和跟踪流水线。融合跟踪器集成了边界框与多模态BEV融合特征，无需显式运动模型。跟踪前使用时序平滑器在移动窗口上精炼边界框序列。

Result: 在nuScenes测试集上达到74.7的aMOTA，在3D MOT基准测试中表现出色，减少了身份切换同时保持了竞争性的准确率。

Conclusion: 基于查询的transformer跟踪方法从多模态传感器特征中获益显著，提供了一个无需预训练和有限数据下就能与其他神经网络方法竞争的框架。

Abstract: We propose FutrTrack, a modular camera-LiDAR multi-object tracking framework
that builds on existing 3D detectors by introducing a transformer-based
smoother and a fusion-driven tracker. Inspired by query-based tracking
frameworks, FutrTrack employs a multimodal two-stage transformer refinement and
tracking pipeline. Our fusion tracker integrates bounding boxes with multimodal
bird's-eye-view (BEV) fusion features from multiple cameras and LiDAR without
the need for an explicit motion model. The tracker assigns and propagates
identities across frames, leveraging both geometric and semantic cues for
robust re-identification under occlusion and viewpoint changes. Prior to
tracking, we refine sequences of bounding boxes with a temporal smoother over a
moving window to refine trajectories, reduce jitter, and improve spatial
consistency. Evaluated on nuScenes and KITTI, FutrTrack demonstrates that
query-based transformer tracking methods benefit significantly from multimodal
sensor features compared with previous single-sensor approaches. With an aMOTA
of 74.7 on the nuScenes test set, FutrTrack achieves strong performance on 3D
MOT benchmarks, reducing identity switches while maintaining competitive
accuracy. Our approach provides an efficient framework for improving
transformer-based trackers to compete with other neural-network-based methods
even with limited data and without pretraining.

TL;DR: 在线标签平滑（OLS）通过动态调整软标签来改善医学图像分类中的过度自信问题，在RadImageNet数据集上相比传统方法提升了Top-1和Top-5准确率，并产生更紧凑的特征嵌入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在医学图像分类中常产生过度自信的预测，影响其在关键医疗环境中的可靠性。传统标签平滑方法未能考虑类别间关系，将所有非目标类别同等对待。

Method: 使用在线标签平滑（OLS）方法，在训练过程中根据模型自身预测模式动态调整软标签。在RadImageNet数据集上评估了ResNet-50、MobileNetV2和VGG-19三种架构。

Result: OLS相比硬标签、传统标签平滑和无教师知识蒸馏等方法，持续提高了Top-1和Top-5分类准确率，并产生了更紧凑、分离度更好的特征嵌入。

Conclusion: OLS不仅增强了预测性能，还提高了校准度，是医学影像领域开发可信AI系统的实用有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks, have achieved
impressive results in medical image classification. However, these models often
produce overconfident predictions, which can undermine their reliability in
critical healthcare settings. While traditional label smoothing offers a simple
way to reduce such overconfidence, it fails to consider relationships between
classes by treating all non-target classes equally. In this study, we explore
the use of Online Label Smoothing (OLS), a dynamic approach that adjusts soft
labels throughout training based on the model's own prediction patterns. We
evaluate OLS on the large-scale RadImageNet dataset using three widely used
architectures: ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19. Our results show that OLS
consistently improves both Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy compared to
standard training methods, including hard labels, conventional label smoothing,
and teacher-free knowledge distillation. In addition to accuracy gains, OLS
leads to more compact and well-separated feature embeddings, indicating
improved representation learning. These findings suggest that OLS not only
strengthens predictive performance but also enhances calibration, making it a
practical and effective solution for developing trustworthy AI systems in the
medical imaging domain.

Abstract: Fisheye cameras offer an efficient solution for wide-area traffic
surveillance by capturing large fields of view from a single vantage point.
However, the strong radial distortion and nonuniform resolution inherent in
fisheye imagery introduce substantial challenges for standard object detectors,
particularly near image boundaries where object appearance is severely
degraded. In this work, we present a detection framework designed to operate
robustly under these conditions. Our approach employs a simple yet effective
pre and post processing pipeline that enhances detection consistency across the
image, especially in regions affected by severe distortion. We train several
state-of-the-art detection models on the fisheye traffic imagery and combine
their outputs through an ensemble strategy to improve overall detection
accuracy. Our method achieves an F1 score of0.6366 on the 2025 AI City
Challenge Track 4, placing 8thoverall out of 62 teams. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in addressing issues inherent to

TL;DR: 提出了一种实时渲染感知滤波方法，通过基于中间梯度计算的敏感度分数来减少3D高斯泼溅模型在训练数据分布外区域产生的视觉噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅模型在训练数据分布外的相机视角下会产生严重的视觉噪声，这是由于缺乏这些外推区域的训练数据导致的密度、颜色和几何预测不确定性。

Method: 利用从中间梯度导出的敏感度分数，专门针对由各向异性方向引起的不稳定性进行滤波，而不是各向同性方差。该方法直接解决生成不确定性的核心问题。

Result: 实验评估表明，与现有的基于神经辐射场的方法相比，该方法显著提高了视觉质量、真实感和一致性。该滤波器能够实时无缝集成到现有的3DGS渲染管线中。

Conclusion: 该方法使3D重建系统能够在用户自由导航到原始训练视角之外时保持高视觉保真度，无需进行大量的事后重新训练或微调。

Abstract: When viewing a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from camera positions
significantly outside the training data distribution, substantial visual noise
commonly occurs. These artifacts result from the lack of training data in these
extrapolated regions, leading to uncertain density, color, and geometry
predictions from the model.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel real-time render-aware filtering
method. Our approach leverages sensitivity scores derived from intermediate
gradients, explicitly targeting instabilities caused by anisotropic
orientations rather than isotropic variance. This filtering method directly
addresses the core issue of generative uncertainty, allowing 3D reconstruction
systems to maintain high visual fidelity even when users freely navigate
outside the original training viewpoints.
  Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method substantially improves
visual quality, realism, and consistency compared to existing Neural Radiance
Field (NeRF)-based approaches such as BayesRays. Critically, our filter
seamlessly integrates into existing 3DGS rendering pipelines in real-time,
unlike methods that require extensive post-hoc retraining or fine-tuning.

Abstract: Ultrasound brain imaging remains challenging due to the large difference in
sound speed between the skull and brain tissues and the difficulty of coupling
large probes to the skull. This work aims to achieve quantitative transcranial
ultrasound by reconstructing an accurate speed-of-sound (SoS) map of the brain.
Traditional physics-based full-waveform inversion (FWI) is limited by weak
signals caused by skull-induced attenuation, mode conversion, and phase
aberration, as well as incomplete spatial coverage since full-aperture arrays
are clinically impractical. In contrast, purely data-driven methods that learn
directly from raw ultrasound data often fail to model the complex nonlinear and
nonlocal wave propagation through bone, leading to anatomically plausible but
quantitatively biased SoS maps under low signal-to-noise and sparse-aperture
conditions. To address these issues, we propose BrainPuzzle, a hybrid two-stage
framework that combines physical modeling with machine learning. In the first
stage, reverse time migration (time-reversal acoustics) is applied to
multi-angle acquisitions to produce migration fragments that preserve
structural details even under low SNR. In the second stage, a transformer-based
super-resolution encoder-decoder with a graph-based attention unit (GAU) fuses
these fragments into a coherent and quantitatively accurate SoS image. A
partial-array acquisition strategy using a movable low-count transducer set
improves feasibility and coupling, while the hybrid algorithm compensates for
the missing aperture. Experiments on two synthetic datasets show that
BrainPuzzle achieves superior SoS reconstruction accuracy and image
completeness, demonstrating its potential for advancing quantitative ultrasound
brain imaging.

TL;DR: 该研究系统评估了生成式图像模型中的文化偏见，发现模型倾向于默认使用全球北方、现代风格的描绘，迭代编辑会侵蚀文化保真度，且模型仅应用表面线索而非上下文感知的更改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注文生图系统的文化偏见，而图生图编辑系统尚未得到充分探索。本研究旨在填补这一空白，通过标准化协议评估两种系统在不同国家、时代和类别下的文化表现。

Method: 使用固定设置的开放模型，结合标准自动指标、文化感知的检索增强VQA和来自本地评审的专家人类判断，对六个国家进行跨国家、跨时代和跨类别评估。

Result: 研究发现：(1) 国家无关提示下模型默认全球北方现代风格描绘；(2) 迭代编辑侵蚀文化保真度；(3) 模型仅应用表面线索而非上下文感知更改。

Conclusion: 当前系统的文化敏感编辑仍不可靠，研究通过发布标准化数据、提示和评估协议，为诊断和跟踪生成式图像模型的文化偏见提供了可复现的文化中心基准。

Abstract: Generative image models produce striking visuals yet often misrepresent
culture. Prior work has examined cultural bias mainly in text-to-image (T2I)
systems, leaving image-to-image (I2I) editors underexplored. We bridge this gap
with a unified evaluation across six countries, an 8-category/36-subcategory
schema, and era-aware prompts, auditing both T2I generation and I2I editing
under a standardized protocol that yields comparable diagnostics. Using open
models with fixed settings, we derive cross-country, cross-era, and
cross-category evaluations. Our framework combines standard automatic metrics,
a culture-aware retrieval-augmented VQA, and expert human judgments collected
from native reviewers. To enable reproducibility, we release the complete image
corpus, prompts, and configurations. Our study reveals three findings: (1)
under country-agnostic prompts, models default to Global-North, modern-leaning
depictions that flatten cross-country distinctions; (2) iterative I2I editing
erodes cultural fidelity even when conventional metrics remain flat or improve;
and (3) I2I models apply superficial cues (palette shifts, generic props)
rather than era-consistent, context-aware changes, often retaining source
identity for Global-South targets. These results highlight that
culture-sensitive edits remain unreliable in current systems. By releasing
standardized data, prompts, and human evaluation protocols, we provide a
reproducible, culture-centered benchmark for diagnosing and tracking cultural
bias in generative image models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FIBAR方法，一种基于滤波器的异步重建方法，用于从移动事件相机的事件流重建强度图像。该方法使用时间数字IIR滤波器整合事件信号，通过新颖的算法检测陈旧像素并应用高斯滤波降噪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于神经网络的强度图像重建方法通常需要GPU且复杂，本文旨在开发一种更简单、异步的CPU上运行的重建方法。

Method: 使用时间数字IIR滤波器整合事件信号强度变化；通过检测最近更新像素窗口的新算法识别陈旧像素；对陈旧像素应用高斯滤波降噪；支持任意时间点的异步图像读取。

Result: FIBAR在现代笔记本电脑CPU上运行速度达42-140百万事件/秒；重建图像比神经网络方法噪声更大且存在重影问题；但对于某些任务（如基准标记检测）足够有效。

Conclusion: FIBAR提供了一种简单有效的异步图像重建方法，虽然重建质量不如神经网络方法，但在CPU上运行速度快，适用于某些特定应用场景。

Abstract: Reconstructing an intensity image from the events of a moving event camera is
a challenging task that is typically approached with neural networks deployed
on graphics processing units. This paper presents a much simpler, FIlter Based
Asynchronous Reconstruction method (FIBAR). First, intensity changes signaled
by events are integrated with a temporal digital IIR filter. To reduce
reconstruction noise, stale pixels are detected by a novel algorithm that
regulates a window of recently updated pixels. Arguing that for a moving
camera, the absence of events at a pixel location likely implies a low image
gradient, stale pixels are then blurred with a Gaussian filter. In contrast to
most existing methods, FIBAR is asynchronous and permits image read-out at an
arbitrary time. It runs on a modern laptop CPU at about 42(140) million
events/s with (without) spatial filtering enabled. A few simple qualitative
experiments are presented that show the difference in image reconstruction
between FIBAR and a neural network-based approach (FireNet). FIBAR's
reconstruction is noisier than neural network-based methods and suffers from
ghost images. However, it is sufficient for certain tasks such as the detection
of fiducial markers. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有张量低秩表示方法依赖固定变换，对噪声鲁棒性差，需要更有效捕捉全局和局部相关性的方法。

Method: TBTLRR模型引入数据自适应张量核范数学习任意酉变换，利用双边结构捕捉局部相关性，集成ℓ1/2-范数和Frobenius范数正则化处理复杂噪声，采用ADMM启发的优化算法。

Result: 大量实验验证TBTLRR在聚类任务上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: TBTLRR通过自适应变换、双边结构和混合正则化，显著提升了图像聚类的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Tensor low-rank representation (TLRR) has demonstrated significant success in
image clustering. However, most existing methods rely on fixed transformations
and suffer from poor robustness to noise. In this paper, we propose a novel
transformed bilateral tensor low-rank representation model called TBTLRR, which
introduces a data-adaptive tensor nuclear norm by learning arbitrary unitary
transforms, allowing for more effective capture of global correlations. In
addition, by leveraging the bilateral structure of latent tensor data, TBTLRR
is able to exploit local correlations between image samples and features.
Furthermore, TBTLRR integrates the $\ell_{1/2}$-norm and Frobenius norm
regularization terms for better dealing with complex noise in real-world
scenarios. To solve the proposed nonconvex model, we develop an efficient
optimization algorithm inspired by the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) and provide theoretical convergence. Extensive experiments
validate its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in clustering. The
code will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/TBTLRR.

Motivation: 视频评估和外科数据科学可以推动外科培训、研究和质量改进，但异构记录格式和视频共享的隐私问题限制了广泛应用。

Method: 采用软件开发生命周期和用户中心反馈迭代开发。分析阶段通过内部调查确定关键需求，测试阶段结合可用性启发式和技术接受模型评估可用性和采用度。

Result: 原型测试显示高可用性评分（临床医生4.68/5，计算机科学家4.03/5），改进后外科医生报告高感知有用性（5.07/7）、易用性（5.15/7）和强烈推荐（9.20/10）。处理时间受处理模式、视频时长和机器计算能力影响。

Conclusion: Endoshare提供了一个透明、用户友好的标准化隐私保护外科视频管理流程，需要合规认证和更广泛的互操作性验证才能成为可部署的专有系统替代方案。

Abstract: Video-based assessment and surgical data science can advance surgical
training, research, and quality improvement. However, widespread use remains
limited by heterogeneous recording formats and privacy concerns associated with
video sharing. We present Endoshare, a source-available, cross-platform
application for merging, standardizing, and de-identifying endoscopic videos in
minimally invasive surgery. Development followed the software development life
cycle with iterative, user-centered feedback. During the analysis phase, an
internal survey of clinicians and computer scientists based on ten usability
heuristics identified key requirements that guided a privacy-by-design
architecture. In the testing phase, an external clinician survey combined the
same heuristics with Technology Acceptance Model constructs to assess usability
and adoption, complemented by benchmarking across different hardware
configurations. Four clinicians and four computer scientists initially tested
the prototype, reporting high usability (4.68 +/- 0.40/5 and 4.03 +/- 0.51/5),
with the lowest score (4.00 +/- 0.93/5) relating to label clarity. After
refinement, the testing phase surveyed ten surgeons who reported high perceived
usefulness (5.07 +/- 1.75/7), ease of use (5.15 +/- 1.71/7), heuristic
usability (4.38 +/- 0.48/5), and strong recommendation (9.20 +/- 0.79/10).
Processing time varied with processing mode, video duration (both p <= 0.001),
and machine computational power (p = 0.041). Endoshare provides a transparent,
user-friendly pipeline for standardized, privacy-preserving surgical video
management. Compliance certification and broader interoperability validation
are needed to establish it as a deployable alternative to proprietary systems.

*Hao Yu,Haoyu Chen,Yan Jiang,Wei Peng,Zhaodong Sun,Samuel Kaski,Guoying Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了注意力卷积（ATConv），通过将自注意力机制的两个关键特性——自适应路由和侧向抑制——融入传统卷积，在保持线性复杂度的同时显著提升了CNN的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力机制虽然表达能力强，但二次复杂度限制了实际应用。传统卷积具有线性复杂度但性能存在差距。本文旨在探索自注意力优于卷积的根本原因，并设计兼具两者优势的新算子。

Method: 揭示了自注意力的两个关键特性：自适应路由（根据语义内容动态调节位置信息流）和侧向抑制（通过分数竞争抑制冗余）。基于此提出了ATConv，将这两个原则内在地注入卷积算子中。

Result: 仅使用3×3核的ATConv在基础视觉任务中持续优于各种自注意力机制。基于ATConv的AttNet在ImageNet-1K上达到84.4%的Top-1准确率（仅27M参数）。在扩散模型中用ATConv替换自注意力可将FID降低0.15，并实现更快采样。

Conclusion: ATConv成功将自注意力的核心优势融入卷积框架，在保持线性复杂度的同时实现了超越自注意力的性能，为视觉骨干网络设计提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Self-attention (SA) has become the cornerstone of modern vision backbones for
its powerful expressivity over traditional Convolutions (Conv). However, its
quadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for practical applications.
Given that Conv offers linear complexity and strong visual priors, continuing
efforts have been made to promote the renaissance of Conv. However, a
persistent performance chasm remains, highlighting that these modernizations
have not yet captured the intrinsic expressivity that defines SA. In this
paper, we re-examine the design of the CNNs, directed by a key question: what
principles give SA its edge over Conv? As a result, we reveal two fundamental
insights that challenge the long-standing design intuitions in prior research
(e.g., Receptive field). The two findings are: (1) \textit{Adaptive routing}:
SA dynamically regulates positional information flow according to semantic
content, whereas Conv employs static kernels uniformly across all positions.
(2) \textit{Lateral inhibition}: SA induces score competition among token
weighting, effectively suppressing redundancy and sharpening representations,
whereas Conv filters lack such inhibitory dynamics and exhibit considerable
redundancy. Based on this, we propose \textit{Attentive Convolution} (ATConv),
a principled reformulation of the convolutional operator that intrinsically
injects these principles. Interestingly, with only $3\times3$ kernels, ATConv
consistently outperforms various SA mechanisms in fundamental vision tasks.
Building on ATConv, we introduce AttNet, a CNN family that can attain
\textbf{84.4\%} ImageNet-1K Top-1 accuracy with only 27M parameters. In
diffusion-based image generation, replacing all SA with the proposed $3\times
3$ ATConv in SiT-XL/2 reduces ImageNet FID by 0.15 in 400k steps with faster
sampling. Code is available at: github.com/price112/Attentive-Convolution.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型在生成像素级手绘草图方面存在困难，手绘草图作为抽象表达的代表形式，其生成质量有待提升。

Method: 1. 微调变分自编码器优化潜在解码，更好捕捉草图特征；2. 集成基于视觉问答的新奖励函数，改善文本-图像对齐和语义一致性。

Result: 实验表明StableSketcher生成的草图具有更好的风格保真度，相比Stable Diffusion基线在提示对齐方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 提出了首个包含实例级草图、标题和问答对的数据集SketchDUO，解决了现有数据集依赖图像-标签对的局限性。

Abstract: Although recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly enriched
the quality of generated images, challenges remain in synthesizing pixel-based
human-drawn sketches, a representative example of abstract expression. To
combat these challenges, we propose StableSketcher, a novel framework that
empowers diffusion models to generate hand-drawn sketches with high prompt
fidelity. Within this framework, we fine-tune the variational autoencoder to
optimize latent decoding, enabling it to better capture the characteristics of
sketches. In parallel, we integrate a new reward function for reinforcement
learning based on visual question answering, which improves text-image
alignment and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
StableSketcher generates sketches with improved stylistic fidelity, achieving
better alignment with prompts compared to the Stable Diffusion baseline.
Additionally, we introduce SketchDUO, to the best of our knowledge, the first
dataset comprising instance-level sketches paired with captions and
question-answer pairs, thereby addressing the limitations of existing datasets
that rely on image-label pairs. Our code and dataset will be made publicly
available upon acceptance.

Motivation: 生物多模态基础模型缺乏实例特定的描述性标题作为监督信号，这限制了自然语言监督在生物领域的应用，而图像和标题可以看作物种潜在形态空间中的互补样本。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型生成合成标题，结合维基百科视觉信息和分类群定制格式示例来减少幻觉，产生准确的实例描述性标题，并利用这些标题训练BIOCAP模型。

Conclusion: 描述性标题超越了传统标签的价值，能够有效桥接生物图像与多模态基础模型，展示了在生物领域使用自然语言监督的潜力。

Abstract: This work investigates descriptive captions as an additional source of
supervision for biological multimodal foundation models. Images and captions
can be viewed as complementary samples from the latent morphospace of a
species, each capturing certain biological traits. Incorporating captions
during training encourages alignment with this shared latent structure,
emphasizing potentially diagnostic characters while suppressing spurious
correlations. The main challenge, however, lies in obtaining faithful,
instance-specific captions at scale. This requirement has limited the
utilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology compared with
many other scientific domains. We complement this gap by generating synthetic
captions with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by
Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples. These
domain-specific contexts help reduce hallucination and yield accurate,
instance-based descriptive captions. Using these captions, we train BIOCAP
(i.e., BIOCLIP with Captions), a biological foundation model that captures rich
semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and
text-image retrieval. These results demonstrate the value of descriptive
captions beyond labels in bridging biological images with multimodal foundation
models.

significantly improves tracking performance in challenging scenarios such as
occlusions and rapid direction changes. We evaluated our proposed system on a
custom racquetball dataset. Our evaluation shows our system surpassing kalman

system has significant applications for improving robot perception on

physics-based models with deep learning approaches for real-time 3D detection
and tracking of challenging small objects.

Abstract: A concept of light-fields computed from multiple view images on regular grids
has proven its benefit for scene representations, and supported realistic
renderings of novel views and photographic effects such as refocusing and
shallow depth of field. In spite of its effectiveness of light flow
computations, obtaining light fields requires either computational costs or
specialized devices like a bulky camera setup and a specialized microlens
array. In an effort to broaden its benefit and applicability, in this paper, we
propose a novel view synthesis method for light field generation from only
single images, named inverse image-based rendering. Unlike previous attempts to
implicitly rebuild 3D geometry or to explicitly represent objective scenes, our
method reconstructs light flows in a space from image pixels, which behaves in
the opposite way to image-based rendering. To accomplish this, we design a
neural rendering pipeline to render a target ray in an arbitrary viewpoint. Our
neural renderer first stores the light flow of source rays from the input
image, then computes the relationships among them through cross-attention, and
finally predicts the color of the target ray based on these relationships.
After the rendering pipeline generates the first novel view from a single input
image, the generated out-of-view contents are updated to the set of source
rays. This procedure is iteratively performed while ensuring the consistent
generation of occluded contents. We demonstrate that our inverse image-based
rendering works well with various challenging datasets without any retraining
or finetuning after once trained on synthetic dataset, and outperforms relevant
state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的后处理方法往往未充分利用模型logit空间中丰富的信息，需要更有效地利用logit关系来提升OOD检测性能。

Method: 提出LogitGap方法，显式利用最大logit与剩余logit的关系，并引入无训练策略自动识别最具信息量的logit子集进行评分。

Result: 在视觉语言和纯视觉模型上的广泛实验表明，LogitGap在多种OOD检测场景和基准测试中均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: LogitGap通过有效利用logit空间关系，为OOD检测提供了一种高效且性能优越的后处理方法。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models in open-world applications. While post-hoc methods are
favored for their efficiency and ease of deployment, existing approaches often
underexploit the rich information embedded in the model's logits space. In this
paper, we propose LogitGap, a novel post-hoc OOD detection method that
explicitly exploits the relationship between the maximum logit and the
remaining logits to enhance the separability between in-distribution (ID) and
OOD samples. To further improve its effectiveness, we refine LogitGap by
focusing on a more compact and informative subset of the logit space.
Specifically, we introduce a training-free strategy that automatically
identifies the most informative logits for scoring. We provide both theoretical
analysis and empirical evidence to validate the effectiveness of our approach.
Extensive experiments on both vision-language and vision-only models
demonstrate that LogitGap consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance
across diverse OOD detection scenarios and benchmarks. Code is available at

Abstract: Understanding objects at the level of their constituent parts is fundamental
to advancing computer vision, graphics, and robotics. While datasets like
PartNet have driven progress in 3D part understanding, their reliance on
untextured geometries and expert-dependent annotation limits scalability and
usability. We introduce PartNeXt, a next-generation dataset addressing these
gaps with over 23,000 high-quality, textured 3D models annotated with
fine-grained, hierarchical part labels across 50 categories. We benchmark
PartNeXt on two tasks: (1) class-agnostic part segmentation, where
state-of-the-art methods (e.g., PartField, SAMPart3D) struggle with
fine-grained and leaf-level parts, and (2) 3D part-centric question answering,
a new benchmark for 3D-LLMs that reveals significant gaps in open-vocabulary
part grounding. Additionally, training Point-SAM on PartNeXt yields substantial
gains over PartNet, underscoring the dataset's superior quality and diversity.
By combining scalable annotation, texture-aware labels, and multi-task
evaluation, PartNeXt opens new avenues for research in structured 3D
understanding.

Abstract: In Autonomous Driving, cyclists belong to the safety-critical class of
Vulnerable Road Users (VRU), and accurate estimation of their pose is critical
for cyclist crossing intention classification, behavior prediction, and
collision avoidance. Unlike rigid objects, articulated bicycles are composed of
movable rigid parts linked by joints and constrained by a kinematic structure.
6D pose methods can estimate the 3D rotation and translation of rigid bicycles,
but 6D becomes insufficient when the steering/pedals angles of the bicycle
vary. That is because: 1) varying the articulated pose of the bicycle causes
its 3D bounding box to vary as well, and 2) the 3D box orientation is not
necessarily aligned to the orientation of the steering which determines the
actual intended travel direction. In this work, we introduce a method for
category-level 8D pose estimation for articulated bicycles and cyclists from a
single RGB image. Besides being able to estimate the 3D translation and
rotation of a bicycle from a single image, our method also estimates the
rotations of its steering handles and pedals with respect to the bicycle body
frame. These two new parameters enable the estimation of a more fine-grained
bicycle pose state and travel direction. Our proposed model jointly estimates
the 8D pose and the 3D Keypoints of articulated bicycles, and trains with a mix
of synthetic and real image data to generalize on real images. We include an
evaluation section where we evaluate the accuracy of our estimated 8D pose
parameters, and our method shows promising results by achieving competitive
scores when compared against state-of-the-art category-level 6D pose estimators
that use rigid canonical object templates for matching.

Conclusion: 该方法通过多模态知识积累和自适应原型更新，有效解决了组合零样本学习中的分布偏移问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel
attribute-object compositions based on the knowledge learned from seen ones.
Existing methods suffer from performance degradation caused by the distribution
shift of label space at test time, which stems from the inclusion of unseen
compositions recombined from attributes and objects. To overcome the challenge,
we propose a novel approach that accumulates comprehensive knowledge in both
textual and visual modalities from unsupervised data to update multimodal
prototypes at test time. Building on this, we further design an adaptive update
weight to control the degree of prototype adjustment, enabling the model to
flexibly adapt to distribution shift during testing. Moreover, a dynamic
priority queue is introduced that stores high-confidence images to acquire
visual knowledge from historical images for inference. Considering the semantic
consistency of multimodal knowledge, we align textual and visual prototypes by
multimodal collaborative representation learning. Extensive experiments
indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four
benchmark datasets under both closed-world and open-world settings. Code will

*Insu Jeon,Wonkwang Lee,Myeongjang Pyeon,Gunhee Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IB-GAN是一种基于GAN的无监督解耦表示学习模型，通过信息瓶颈框架优化GAN，在生成器中间层约束输入与输出的互信息，实现可解释的解耦潜在空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用信息瓶颈(IB)框架来优化GAN，以改进解耦表示学习，克服InfoGAN在解耦能力上的不足。

Method: 在生成器中引入中间随机层，约束输入与生成输出之间的互信息，形成可学习的潜在分布，与生成器端到端联合训练。

Result: 在dSprites和Color-dSprites数据集上达到与最先进β-VAEs竞争的解耦分数，优于InfoGAN；在CelebA和3D Chairs数据集上，生成样本的视觉质量和多样性在FID得分上优于β-VAEs和InfoGAN。

Conclusion: IB-GAN通过信息瓶颈框架有效实现了GAN的解耦表示学习，在解耦性能和生成质量方面均表现出色。

Abstract: We propose a new GAN-based unsupervised model for disentangled representation
learning. The new model is discovered in an attempt to utilize the Information
Bottleneck (IB) framework to the optimization of GAN, thereby named IB-GAN. The
architecture of IB-GAN is partially similar to that of InfoGAN but has a
critical difference; an intermediate layer of the generator is leveraged to
constrain the mutual information between the input and the generated output.
The intermediate stochastic layer can serve as a learnable latent distribution
that is trained with the generator jointly in an end-to-end fashion. As a
result, the generator of IB-GAN can harness the latent space in a disentangled
and interpretable manner. With the experiments on dSprites and Color-dSprites
dataset, we demonstrate that IB-GAN achieves competitive disentanglement scores
to those of state-of-the-art \b{eta}-VAEs and outperforms InfoGAN. Moreover,
the visual quality and the diversity of samples generated by IB-GAN are often
better than those by \b{eta}-VAEs and Info-GAN in terms of FID score on CelebA
and 3D Chairs dataset.

TL;DR: PPMStereo提出了一种基于记忆缓冲区的动态立体匹配方法，通过Pick-and-Play Memory模块实现长时空一致性建模，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升深度估计的时间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决立体视频中深度估计的时间一致性问题，这对于增强现实等应用至关重要。现有方法在建模长期时间依赖时面临计算成本与性能的权衡困境。

Method: 提出Pick-and-Play Memory (PPM)模块，包含'pick'过程选择最相关帧和'play'过程自适应加权选择帧进行时空聚合，模拟人类两阶段决策过程。

Result: 在Sintel数据集上，PPMStereo在clean/final上分别达到0.62/1.11 TEPE，相比BiDAStereo提升17.3%和9.02%，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: PPMStereo通过紧凑而信息丰富的记忆缓冲区实现了高效的长时空一致性建模，在精度和时间一致性方面均达到最先进水平。

Abstract: Temporally consistent depth estimation from stereo video is critical for
real-world applications such as augmented reality, where inconsistent depth
estimation disrupts the immersion of users. Despite its importance, this task
remains challenging due to the difficulty in modeling long-term temporal
consistency in a computationally efficient manner. Previous methods attempt to
address this by aggregating spatio-temporal information but face a fundamental
trade-off: limited temporal modeling provides only modest gains, whereas
capturing long-range dependencies significantly increases computational cost.
To address this limitation, we introduce a memory buffer for modeling
long-range spatio-temporal consistency while achieving efficient dynamic stereo
matching. Inspired by the two-stage decision-making process in humans, we
propose a \textbf{P}ick-and-\textbf{P}lay \textbf{M}emory (PPM) construction
module for dynamic \textbf{Stereo} matching, dubbed as \textbf{PPMStereo}. PPM
consists of a `pick' process that identifies the most relevant frames and a
`play' process that weights the selected frames adaptively for spatio-temporal
aggregation. This two-stage collaborative process maintains a compact yet
highly informative memory buffer while achieving temporally consistent
information aggregation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of
PPMStereo, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
temporal consistency. % Notably, PPMStereo achieves 0.62/1.11 TEPE on the
Sintel clean/final (17.3\% \& 9.02\% improvements over BiDAStereo) with fewer
computational costs. Codes are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注单个主体而非多交互人物的场景，多智能体动态在生成视频中的合理性尚未得到验证。

Method: 为I2V使用现有数据集的起始帧与真实视频比较，为T2V开发包含不同行人密度和交互的提示套件，并提出从像素空间重建2D鸟瞰轨迹的方法。

Result: 分析显示领先模型已学习到令人惊讶的有效多智能体行为先验，但存在人物合并和消失等失败模式。

Conclusion: 该研究为评估视频生成模型作为行人动态模拟器提供了严格基准，揭示了当前模型的优势和待改进领域。

Abstract: Large-scale video generation models have demonstrated high visual realism in
diverse contexts, spurring interest in their potential as general-purpose world
simulators. Existing benchmarks focus on individual subjects rather than scenes
with multiple interacting people. However, the plausibility of multi-agent
dynamics in generated videos remains unverified. We propose a rigorous
evaluation protocol to benchmark text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V)
models as implicit simulators of pedestrian dynamics. For I2V, we leverage
start frames from established datasets to enable comparison with a ground truth
video dataset. For T2V, we develop a prompt suite to explore diverse pedestrian
densities and interactions. A key component is a method to reconstruct 2D
bird's-eye view trajectories from pixel-space without known camera parameters.
Our analysis reveals that leading models have learned surprisingly effective
priors for plausible multi-agent behavior. However, failure modes like merging
and disappearing people highlight areas for future improvement.

TL;DR: SPAN网络将可疑意图检测从离散分类转向连续回归，通过时序点过程理论建模长期依赖和累积效应，结合多模态信息调整可疑系数，显著提升检测性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离散分类方法无法捕捉可疑意图的连续变化特性，限制了早期干预和可解释性，需要转向连续建模方法。

Method: 提出SPAN网络，采用连续回归方法，定义可疑分数公式建模时序特征，引入可疑系数调制和多模态信息，使用概念锚定映射方法关联行为与意图概念。

Result: 在HAI数据集上，SPAN显著优于现有方法，MSE降低19.8%，平均mAP提升1.78%，在低频情况下mAP增益达2.74%。

Conclusion: 连续可疑建模方法比离散分类系统能更早检测和主动干预，大大增强了安全应用中的系统可解释性和实用性。

Abstract: Temporal Intention Localization (TIL) is crucial for video surveillance,
focusing on identifying varying levels of suspicious intentions to improve
security monitoring. However, existing discrete classification methods fail to
capture the continuous nature of suspicious intentions, limiting early
intervention and explainability. In this paper, we propose the Suspicion
Progression Analysis Network (SPAN), which shifts from discrete classification
to continuous regression, enabling the capture of fluctuating and evolving
suspicious intentions. We reveal that suspicion exhibits long-term dependencies
and cumulative effects, similar to Temporal Point Process (TPP) theory. Based
on these insights, we define a suspicion score formula that models continuous
changes while accounting for temporal characteristics. We also introduce
Suspicion Coefficient Modulation, which adjusts suspicion coefficients using
multimodal information to reflect the varying impacts of suspicious actions.
Additionally, the Concept-Anchored Mapping method is proposed to link
suspicious actions to predefined intention concepts, offering insights into
both the actions and their potential underlying intentions. Extensive
experiments on the HAI dataset show that SPAN significantly outperforms
existing methods, reducing MSE by 19.8% and improving average mAP by 1.78%.
Notably, SPAN achieves a 2.74% mAP gain in low-frequency cases, demonstrating
its superior ability to capture subtle behavioral changes. Compared to discrete
classification systems, our continuous suspicion modeling approach enables
earlier detection and proactive intervention, greatly enhancing system
explainability and practical utility in security applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑MRI基础模型的发展依赖于数据的规模、多样性和一致性，但目前缺乏对这些因素的系统评估。

Method: 在数据集层面分析模态组成、疾病覆盖和规模；在图像层面量化体素间距、方向和强度分布；评估预处理变异性对体素统计和几何的影响；使用3D DenseNet121进行特征空间案例研究。

Result: 发现健康队列与临床人群之间存在严重不平衡，预处理步骤提高了数据集内一致性但无法消除数据集间差异，标准化预处理后仍存在可测量的残差协变量偏移。

Conclusion: 公开脑MRI资源存在显著异质性，仅靠数据协调无法消除数据集间偏差，需要预处理感知和领域自适应策略来开发通用性脑MRI基础模型。

Abstract: The development of foundation models for brain MRI depends critically on the
scale, diversity, and consistency of available data, yet systematic assessments
of these factors remain scarce. In this study, we analyze 54 publicly
accessible brain MRI datasets encompassing over 538,031 to provide a
structured, multi-level overview tailored to foundation model development. At
the dataset level, we characterize modality composition, disease coverage, and
dataset scale, revealing strong imbalances between large healthy cohorts and
smaller clinical populations. At the image level, we quantify voxel spacing,
orientation, and intensity distributions across 15 representative datasets,
demonstrating substantial heterogeneity that can influence representation
learning. We then perform a quantitative evaluation of preprocessing
variability, examining how intensity normalization, bias field correction,
skull stripping, spatial registration, and interpolation alter voxel statistics
and geometry. While these steps improve within-dataset consistency, residual
differences persist between datasets. Finally, feature-space case study using a
3D DenseNet121 shows measurable residual covariate shift after standardized
preprocessing, confirming that harmonization alone cannot eliminate
inter-dataset bias. Together, these analyses provide a unified characterization
of variability in public brain MRI resources and emphasize the need for
preprocessing-aware and domain-adaptive strategies in the design of
generalizable brain MRI foundation models.

TL;DR: RAPO++是一个跨阶段的提示优化框架，通过检索增强提示优化、样本特定提示优化和LLM微调，显著提升文本到视频生成质量，无需修改底层生成模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户提供的提示通常简短、非结构化且与训练数据不匹配，限制了基于扩散的文本到视频模型的生成潜力。

Method: 三阶段方法：1）检索增强提示优化，从关系图中检索语义相关修饰符；2）样本特定提示优化，使用多源反馈迭代优化提示；3）利用优化后的提示对微调重写器LLM。

Result: 在五个最先进的T2V模型和五个基准测试中，RAPO++在语义对齐、组合推理、时间稳定性和物理合理性方面取得显著提升，大幅优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RAPO++是一个模型无关、成本高效且可扩展的解决方案，为T2V生成中的提示优化设定了新标准。

Abstract: Prompt design plays a crucial role in text-to-video (T2V) generation, yet
user-provided prompts are often short, unstructured, and misaligned with
training data, limiting the generative potential of diffusion-based T2V models.
We present \textbf{RAPO++}, a cross-stage prompt optimization framework that
unifies training-data--aligned refinement, test-time iterative scaling, and
large language model (LLM) fine-tuning to substantially improve T2V generation
without modifying the underlying generative backbone. In \textbf{Stage 1},
Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Optimization (RAPO) enriches user prompts with
semantically relevant modifiers retrieved from a relation graph and refactors
them to match training distributions, enhancing compositionality and
multi-object fidelity. \textbf{Stage 2} introduces Sample-Specific Prompt
Optimization (SSPO), a closed-loop mechanism that iteratively refines prompts
using multi-source feedback -- including semantic alignment, spatial fidelity,
temporal coherence, and task-specific signals such as optical flow -- yielding
progressively improved video generation quality. \textbf{Stage 3} leverages
optimized prompt pairs from SSPO to fine-tune the rewriter LLM, internalizing
task-specific optimization patterns and enabling efficient, high-quality prompt
generation even before inference. Extensive experiments across five
state-of-the-art T2V models and five benchmarks demonstrate that RAPO++
achieves significant gains in semantic alignment, compositional reasoning,
temporal stability, and physical plausibility, outperforming existing methods
by large margins. Our results highlight RAPO++ as a model-agnostic,
cost-efficient, and scalable solution that sets a new standard for prompt
optimization in T2V generation. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有文本到图像编辑方法采用目标无关的中间状态构建方式，主要关注源图像重建而忽略了与特定编辑目标的语义差距，导致在需要大幅修改时编辑能力有限或不一致。

Method: 提出FlowCycle框架，通过可学习噪声参数化图像损坏过程，并通过循环一致性过程进行优化。通过从源到目标的迭代编辑和回源恢复的双重一致性约束，学习生成目标感知的中间状态。

Result: 广泛的消融实验表明，FlowCycle在编辑质量和一致性方面优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: FlowCycle通过目标感知的中间状态和循环一致性优化，实现了更忠实和一致的图像编辑效果。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained text-to-image flow models have enabled
remarkable progress in text-based image editing. Mainstream approaches always
adopt a corruption-then-restoration paradigm, where the source image is first
corrupted into an ``intermediate state'' and then restored to the target image
under the prompt guidance. However, current methods construct this intermediate
state in a target-agnostic manner, i.e., they primarily focus on realizing
source image reconstruction while neglecting the semantic gaps towards the
specific editing target. This design inherently results in limited editability
or inconsistency when the desired modifications substantially deviate from the
source. In this paper, we argue that the intermediate state should be
target-aware, i.e., selectively corrupting editing-relevant contents while
preserving editing-irrelevant ones. To this end, we propose FlowCycle, a novel
inversion-free and flow-based editing framework that parameterizes corruption
with learnable noises and optimizes them through a cycle-consistent process. By
iteratively editing the source to the target and recovering back to the source
with dual consistency constraints, FlowCycle learns to produce a target-aware
intermediate state, enabling faithful modifications while preserving source
consistency. Extensive ablations have demonstrated that FlowCycle achieves
superior editing quality and consistency over state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 传统胎儿运动检测方法（如母体感知和胎心监护）存在主观性和准确性有限的问题，需要更可靠的客观检测方法。

Method: 使用双重对比损失的自监督学习框架，结合空间和时间对比学习，采用任务特定采样策略和概率微调方法。

Conclusion: 自监督对比学习在胎儿运动分析中具有潜力，为改善产前监测和临床决策提供了新途径。

Abstract: Accurate fetal movement (FM) detection is essential for assessing prenatal
health, as abnormal movement patterns can indicate underlying complications
such as placental dysfunction or fetal distress. Traditional methods, including
maternal perception and cardiotocography (CTG), suffer from subjectivity and
limited accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Contrastive
Ultrasound Video Representation Learning (CURL), a novel self-supervised
learning framework for FM detection from extended fetal ultrasound video
recordings. Our approach leverages a dual-contrastive loss, incorporating both
spatial and temporal contrastive learning, to learn robust motion
representations. Additionally, we introduce a task-specific sampling strategy,
ensuring the effective separation of movement and non-movement segments during
self-supervised training, while enabling flexible inference on arbitrarily long
ultrasound recordings through a probabilistic fine-tuning approach. Evaluated
on an in-house dataset of 92 subjects, each with 30-minute ultrasound sessions,
CURL achieves a sensitivity of 78.01% and an AUROC of 81.60%, demonstrating its
potential for reliable and objective FM analysis. These results highlight the
potential of self-supervised contrastive learning for fetal movement analysis,
paving the way for improved prenatal monitoring and clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Adapting pretrained diffusion-based generative models for text-driven image
editing with negligible tuning overhead has demonstrated remarkable potential.
A classical adaptation paradigm, as followed by these methods, first infers the
generative trajectory inversely for a given source image by image inversion,
then performs image editing along the inferred trajectory guided by the target
text prompts. However, the performance of image editing is heavily limited by
the approximation errors introduced during image inversion by diffusion models,
which arise from the absence of exact supervision in the intermediate
generative steps. To circumvent this issue, we investigate the
parameter-efficient adaptation of VQ-based generative models for image editing,
and leverage their inherent characteristic that the exact intermediate
quantized representations of a source image are attainable, enabling more
effective supervision for precise image inversion. Specifically, we propose
\emph{EditInfinity}, which adapts \emph{Infinity}, a binary-quantized
generative model, for image editing. We propose an efficient yet effective
image inversion mechanism that integrates text prompting rectification and
image style preservation, enabling precise image inversion. Furthermore, we
devise a holistic smoothing strategy which allows our \emph{EditInfinity} to
perform image editing with high fidelity to source images and precise semantic
alignment to the text prompts. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench benchmark
across "add", "change", and "delete" editing operations, demonstrate the
superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based
baselines. Code available at: https://github.com/yx-chen-ust/EditInfinity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出大型视觉语言模型在生成长文本时更容易产生幻觉，但幻觉增加并非仅由长度引起，而是源于对上下文依赖的增加。作者提出了"诱导-检测-抑制"框架来主动管理幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在生成长文本时存在幻觉问题，传统观点认为是长度导致的错误累积，但作者质疑这种解释，希望探究幻觉产生的深层机制。

Method: 提出"诱导-检测-抑制"三步框架：通过设计特定上下文主动诱导幻觉，利用诱导实例进行早期高风险检测，在实际解码过程中抑制潜在的对象级幻觉。

Result: 该方法在所有基准测试中都取得了显著且一致的改进，验证了框架的有效性，同时重新验证了关于上下文依赖的假设。

Conclusion: 幻觉风险主要源于长文本中对上下文依赖的增加，而非长度本身。该研究为深入探索LVLMs长文本幻觉问题提供了新的见解和初步探索。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in recent
years but are also prone to hallucination issues. They exhibit more
hallucinations in longer, free-form responses, often attributed to accumulated
uncertainties. In this paper, we ask: Does increased hallucination result
solely from length-induced errors, or is there a deeper underlying mechanism?
After a series of preliminary experiments and findings, we suggest that the
risk of hallucinations is not caused by length itself but by the increased
reliance on context for coherence and completeness in longer responses.
Building on these insights, we propose a novel "induce-detect-suppress"
framework that actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed
contexts, leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases,
and ultimately suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual
decoding. Our approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all
benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy. The strong detection and improved
hallucination mitigation not only validate our framework but, more importantly,
re-validate our hypothesis on context. Rather than solely pursuing performance
gains, this study aims to provide new insights and serves as a first step
toward a deeper exploration of hallucinations in LVLMs' longer responses.

Motivation: 现有的基于高斯溅射的方法要么依赖单一3D语言场导致分割效果不佳，要么依赖预计算的类无关分割导致错误累积，需要更好的方法来整合语言和分割线索。

Method: 提出协作场概念，包含实例场和语言场；通过实例到语言特征映射和两阶段训练策略构建协作场；在推理时设计自适应语言到实例提示细化。

Conclusion: COS3D通过协作场和自适应提示细化，有效解决了开放词汇3D分割中的关键挑战，实现了领先性能。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging task,
requiring a mutual understanding of both segmentation and language. However,
existing Gaussian-splatting-based methods rely either on a single 3D language
field, leading to inferior segmentation, or on pre-computed class-agnostic
segmentations, suffering from error accumulation. To address these limitations,
we present COS3D, a new collaborative prompt-segmentation framework that
contributes to effectively integrating complementary language and segmentation
cues throughout its entire pipeline. We first introduce the new concept of
collaborative field, comprising an instance field and a language field, as the
cornerstone for collaboration. During training, to effectively construct the
collaborative field, our key idea is to capture the intrinsic relationship
between the instance field and language field, through a novel
instance-to-language feature mapping and designing an efficient two-stage
training strategy. During inference, to bridge distinct characteristics of the
two fields, we further design an adaptive language-to-instance prompt
refinement, promoting high-quality prompt-segmentation inference. Extensive
experiments not only demonstrate COS3D's leading performance over existing
methods on two widely-used benchmarks but also show its high potential to
various applications,~\ie, novel image-based 3D segmentation, hierarchical
segmentation, and robotics. The code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频时序定位方法在跨模态注意力中对所有文本token统一处理，忽视了它们不同的语义角色，导致过度依赖[EOS]驱动的全局语义而未能有效利用词级信号

Method: 双分支架构：将[EOS]token通过句子级路径处理，将词token聚类为短语级单元进行局部定位；引入token角色感知的跨模态交互策略和联合建模框架

Conclusion: 解耦的语义建模在视频-语言对齐中具有有效性，能够同时捕捉粗粒度和局部语义，实现更具表达力和上下文感知的视频定位

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize temporal segments in long,
untrimmed videos that align with a given natural language query. This task
typically comprises two subtasks: Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection
(HD). While recent advances have been progressed by powerful pretrained
vision-language models such as CLIP and InternVideo2, existing approaches
commonly treat all text tokens uniformly during crossmodal attention,
disregarding their distinct semantic roles. To validate the limitations of this
approach, we conduct controlled experiments demonstrating that VTG models
overly rely on [EOS]-driven global semantics while failing to effectively
utilize word-level signals, which limits their ability to achieve fine-grained
temporal alignment. Motivated by this limitation, we propose DualGround, a
dual-branch architecture that explicitly separates global and local semantics
by routing the [EOS] token through a sentence-level path and clustering word
tokens into phrase-level units for localized grounding. Our method introduces
(1) tokenrole- aware cross modal interaction strategies that align video
features with sentence-level and phrase-level semantics in a structurally
disentangled manner, and (2) a joint modeling framework that not only improves
global sentence-level alignment but also enhances finegrained temporal
grounding by leveraging structured phrase-aware context. This design allows the
model to capture both coarse and localized semantics, enabling more expressive
and context-aware video grounding. DualGround achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection tasks across
QVHighlights and Charades- STA benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of

*Shuhan Hu,Yiru Li,Yuanyuan Li,Yingying Zhu*

TL;DR: 提出EDGeo框架，通过掩码位置编码和上下文增强模块改进跨视角物体地理定位，在CVOGL和VIGOR-Building数据集上实现SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖基于关键点的位置编码，仅捕获2D坐标而忽略物体形状信息，导致对标注偏移敏感且跨视角匹配能力有限

Method: 提出掩码位置编码方案利用分割掩码捕获空间坐标和物体轮廓；设计上下文增强模块使用水平和垂直条带卷积核提取长距离上下文特征；集成构建EDGeo端到端框架

Result: 在两个公开数据集上实现最先进性能，在具有挑战性的地面到卫星场景下定位精度提升3.39%

Conclusion: 为推进跨视角地理定位研究提供了稳健的位置编码范式和上下文建模框架

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization enables high-precision object localization
through cross-view matching, with critical applications in autonomous driving,
urban management, and disaster response. However, existing methods rely on
keypoint-based positional encoding, which captures only 2D coordinates while
neglecting object shape information, resulting in sensitivity to annotation
shifts and limited cross-view matching capability. To address these
limitations, we propose a mask-based positional encoding scheme that leverages
segmentation masks to capture both spatial coordinates and object silhouettes,
thereby upgrading the model from "location-aware" to "object-aware."
Furthermore, to tackle the challenge of large-span objects (e.g., elongated
buildings) in satellite imagery, we design a context enhancement module. This
module employs horizontal and vertical strip convolutional kernels to extract
long-range contextual features, enhancing feature discrimination among
strip-like objects. Integrating MPE and CEM, we present EDGeo, an end-to-end
framework for robust cross-view object geo-localization. Extensive experiments
on two public datasets (CVOGL and VIGOR-Building) demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 3.39% improvement in localization
accuracy under challenging ground-to-satellite scenarios. This work provides a
robust positional encoding paradigm and a contextual modeling framework for
advancing cross-view geo-localization research.

Conclusion: CMC能有效缓解文本主导问题，引导融合过程达成更可靠的多模态共识，提升情感识别准确性

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) has made substantial
progress. Nevertheless, most existing approaches neglect the semantic
inconsistencies that may arise across modalities, such as conflicting emotional
cues between text and visual inputs. Besides, current methods are often
dominated by the text modality due to its strong representational capacity,
which can compromise recognition accuracy. To address these challenges, we
propose a model termed Calibrated Multimodal Consensus (CMC). CMC introduces a
Pseudo Label Generation Module (PLGM) to produce pseudo unimodal labels,
enabling unimodal pretraining in a self-supervised fashion. It then employs a
Parameter-free Fusion Module (PFM) and a Multimodal Consensus Router (MCR) for
multimodal finetuning, thereby mitigating text dominance and guiding the fusion
process toward a more reliable consensus. Experimental results demonstrate that
CMC achieves performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art methods
across four datasets, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI, and
exhibits notable advantages in scenarios with semantic inconsistencies on
CH-SIMS and CH-SIMS v2. The implementation of this work is publicly accessible
at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CMC.

Abstract: Technologies like smartphones have become an essential in our daily lives. It
has made accessible to everyone including visually impaired individuals. With
the use of smartphone cameras, image capturing and processing have become more
convenient. With the use of smartphones and machine learning, the life of
visually impaired can be made a little easier. Daily tasks such as handling
money without relying on someone can be troublesome for them. For that purpose
this paper presents a real-time currency detection system designed to assist
visually impaired individuals. The proposed model is trained on a dataset
containing 30 classes of notes and coins, representing 3 types of currency: US
dollar (USD), Euro (EUR), and Bangladeshi taka (BDT). Our approach uses a
YOLOv8 nano model with a custom detection head featuring deep convolutional
layers and Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks to enhance feature extraction and
detection accuracy. Our model has achieved a higher accuracy of 97.73%, recall
of 95.23%, f1-score of 95.85% and a mean Average Precision at IoU=0.5
(mAP50(B)) of 97.21\%. Using the voice feedback after the detection would help
the visually impaired to identify the currency. This paper aims to create a
practical and efficient currency detection system to empower visually impaired

Motivation: 现有视频异常检测方法在融合多模态信息时方式粗糙，忽略了视频片段中可能存在的大量冗余信息

Method: 基于视频片段生成细粒度多模态特征，总结主要内容，并引入原始视频字幕的文本特征来增强视觉特征的突出部分

Result: 在四个主要数据集上达到最先进性能，消融实验验证了GMFVAD的改进确实源于冗余信息的减少

Conclusion: 利用多模态信息的多样性来细化提取特征，减少视觉特征中的冗余，能有效提升视频异常检测性能

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a challenging task that detects anomalous
frames in continuous surveillance videos. Most previous work utilizes the
spatio-temporal correlation of visual features to distinguish whether there are
abnormalities in video snippets. Recently, some works attempt to introduce
multi-modal information, like text feature, to enhance the results of video
anomaly detection. However, these works merely incorporate text features into
video snippets in a coarse manner, overlooking the significant amount of
redundant information that may exist within the video snippets. Therefore, we
propose to leverage the diversity among multi-modal information to further
refine the extracted features, reducing the redundancy in visual features, and
we propose Grained Multi-modal Feature for Video Anomaly Detection (GMFVAD).
Specifically, we generate more grained multi-modal feature based on the video
snippet, which summarizes the main content, and text features based on the
captions of original video will be introduced to further enhance the visual
features of highlighted portions. Experiments show that the proposed GMFVAD
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four mainly datasets. Ablation
experiments also validate that the improvement of GMFVAD is due to the
reduction of redundant information.

Abstract: Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) refers to answering questions and
providing explanations based on images. While existing methods achieve high
prediction accuracy, they often overlook bias in datasets and lack debiasing
strategies. In this paper, our analysis reveals co-occurrence and statistical
biases in both textual and visual data. We introduce the VCR-OOD datasets,
comprising VCR-OOD-QA and VCR-OOD-VA subsets, which are designed to evaluate
the generalization capabilities of models across two modalities. Furthermore,
we analyze the causal graphs and prediction shortcuts in VCR and adopt a
backdoor adjustment method to remove bias. Specifically, we create a dictionary
based on the set of correct answers to eliminate prediction shortcuts.
Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our debiasing method across
different datasets.

Motivation: 解决CV-SAR图像识别在数据有限和领域偏移场景下面临的泛化性、可解释性和效率之间的表示三难问题，充分利用CV-SAR数据中丰富的电磁散射特征。

Method: 采用"压缩-聚合-压缩"架构：第一阶段进行物理引导压缩，通过字典处理器嵌入物理先验；第二阶段聚合增强表示；最后阶段使用自蒸馏的紧凑分类头进行语义压缩。

Conclusion: KINN有效解决了表示三难问题，为SAR图像分析中的可信AI提供了新路径。

Abstract: Deep learning models for complex-valued Synthetic Aperture Radar (CV-SAR)
image recognition are fundamentally constrained by a representation trilemma
under data-limited and domain-shift scenarios: the concurrent, yet conflicting,
optimization of generalization, interpretability, and efficiency. Our work is
motivated by the premise that the rich electromagnetic scattering features
inherent in CV-SAR data hold the key to resolving this trilemma, yet they are
insufficiently harnessed by conventional data-driven models. To this end, we
introduce the Knowledge-Informed Neural Network (KINN), a lightweight framework
built upon a novel "compression-aggregation-compression" architecture. The
first stage performs a physics-guided compression, wherein a novel dictionary
processor adaptively embeds physical priors, enabling a compact unfolding
network to efficiently extract sparse, physically-grounded signatures. A
subsequent aggregation module enriches these representations, followed by a
final semantic compression stage that utilizes a compact classification head
with self-distillation to learn maximally task-relevant and discriminative
embeddings. We instantiate KINN in both CNN (0.7M) and Vision Transformer
(0.95M) variants. Extensive evaluations on five SAR benchmarks confirm that
KINN establishes a state-of-the-art in parameter-efficient recognition,
offering exceptional generalization in data-scarce and out-of-distribution
scenarios and tangible interpretability, thereby providing an effective
solution to the representation trilemma and offering a new path for trustworthy
AI in SAR image analysis.

Conclusion: DMC³框架有效解决了第一人称视频问答中的独特挑战，通过反事实样本和对比学习显著提升了模型性能

Abstract: Egocentric Video Question Answering (Egocentric VideoQA) plays an important
role in egocentric video understanding, which refers to answering questions
based on first-person videos. Although existing methods have made progress
through the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning, they ignore the unique
challenges posed by the first-person perspective, such as understanding
multiple events and recognizing hand-object interactions. To deal with these
challenges, we propose a Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction
(DMC$^3$) framework, which contains an egocentric videoqa baseline, a
counterfactual sample construction module and a counterfactual sample-involved
contrastive optimization. Specifically, We first develop a counterfactual
sample construction module to generate positive and negative samples for
textual and visual modalities through event description paraphrasing and core
interaction mining, respectively. Then, We feed these samples together with the
original samples into the baseline. Finally, in the counterfactual
sample-involved contrastive optimization module, we apply contrastive loss to
minimize the distance between the original sample features and the positive
sample features, while maximizing the distance from the negative samples.
Experiments show that our method achieve 52.51\% and 46.04\% on the
\textit{normal} and \textit{indirect} splits of EgoTaskQA, and 13.2\% on
QAEGO4D, both reaching the state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: GUI grounding, which maps natural-language instructions to actionable UI
elements, is a core capability of GUI agents. Prior works largely treats
instructions as a static proxy for user intent, overlooking the impact of
instruction diversity and quality on grounding performance. Through a careful
investigation of existing grounding datasets, we find a 23.3% flaw rate in
their instructions and show that inference-time exploitation of instruction
diversity yields up to a substantial 76% relative performance improvement. In
this paper, we introduce the Instruction-as-Reasoning paradigm, treating
instructions as dynamic analytical pathways that offer distinct perspectives
and enabling the model to select the most effective pathway during reasoning.
To achieve this, we propose a two-stage training framework: supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on synthesized, diverse instructions to instill
multi-perspective reasoning, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to
optimize pathway selection and composition. Our resulting models, UI-Ins-7B and
UI-Ins-32B, achieve state-of-the-art results on five challenging grounding
benchmarks and exhibit emergent reasoning, selectively composing and
synthesizing novel instruction pathways at inference. In particular, UI-Ins-32B
attains the best grounding accuracy, scoring 87.3% on UI-I2E-Bench, 57.0% on
ScreenSpot-Pro, and 84.9% on MMBench-GUI L2. Furthermore, our model
demonstrates strong agentic potential, achieving a 74.1% success rate on
AndroidWorld using UI-Ins-7B as the executor. Our in-depth analysis reveals
additional insights such as how reasoning can be formulated to enhance rather
than hinder grounding performance, and how our method mitigates policy collapse
in the SFT+RL framework. All code and model checkpoints will be publicly
released in https://github.com/alibaba/UI-Ins.

Result: 在多个MLLM基准测试上的综合实验表明，HyperET能够持续显著提升现有预训练和微调MLLM的性能，仅需增加不到1%的额外参数。

Conclusion: HyperET提供了一种高效且灵活的MLLM训练方法，成功解决了视觉与文本模态在多层次粒度对齐方面的挑战，显著降低了训练资源需求。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as a transformative
approach for aligning visual and textual understanding. They typically require
extremely high computational resources (e.g., thousands of GPUs) for training
to achieve cross-modal alignment at multi-granularity levels. We argue that a
key source of this inefficiency lies in the vision encoders they widely equip
with, e.g., CLIP and SAM, which lack the alignment with language at
multi-granularity levels. To address this issue, in this paper, we leverage
hyperbolic space, which inherently models hierarchical levels and thus provides
a principled framework for bridging the granularity gap between visual and
textual modalities at an arbitrary granularity level. Concretely, we propose an
efficient training paradigm for MLLMs, dubbed as HyperET, which can optimize
visual representations to align with their textual counterparts at an arbitrary
granularity level through dynamic hyperbolic radius adjustment in hyperbolic
space. HyperET employs learnable matrices with M\"{o}bius multiplication
operations, implemented via three effective configurations: diagonal scaling
matrices, block-diagonal matrices, and banded matrices, providing a flexible
yet efficient parametrization strategy. Comprehensive experiments across
multiple MLLM benchmarks demonstrate that HyperET consistently improves both
existing pre-training and fine-tuning MLLMs clearly with less than 1\%
additional parameters.

Conclusion: AnyPcc通过创新的上下文建模和自适应微调策略，有效解决了点云压缩中的泛化问题，为可复现研究提供了代码和数据集。

Abstract: Generalization remains a critical challenge for deep learning-based point
cloud geometry compression. We argue this stems from two key limitations: the
lack of robust context models and the inefficient handling of
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To address both, we introduce AnyPcc, a
universal point cloud compression framework. AnyPcc first employs a Universal
Context Model that leverages priors from both spatial and channel-wise grouping
to capture robust contextual dependencies. Second, our novel Instance-Adaptive
Fine-Tuning (IAFT) strategy tackles OOD data by synergizing explicit and
implicit compression paradigms. It fine-tunes a small subset of network weights
for each instance and incorporates them into the bitstream, where the marginal
bit cost of the weights is dwarfed by the resulting savings in geometry
compression. Extensive experiments on a benchmark of 15 diverse datasets
confirm that AnyPcc sets a new state-of-the-art in point cloud compression. Our
code and datasets will be released to encourage reproducible research.

Conclusion: AccuQuant通过解决量化误差累积问题，为扩散模型的高效量化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present in this paper a novel post-training quantization (PTQ) method,
dubbed AccuQuant, for diffusion models. We show analytically and empirically
that quantization errors for diffusion models are accumulated over denoising
steps in a sampling process. To alleviate the error accumulation problem,
AccuQuant minimizes the discrepancies between outputs of a full-precision
diffusion model and its quantized version within a couple of denoising steps.
That is, it simulates multiple denoising steps of a diffusion sampling process
explicitly for quantization, accounting the accumulated errors over multiple
denoising steps, which is in contrast to previous approaches to imitating a
training process of diffusion models, namely, minimizing the discrepancies
independently for each step. We also present an efficient implementation
technique for AccuQuant, together with a novel objective, which reduces a
memory complexity significantly from $\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$,
where $n$ is the number of denoising steps. We demonstrate the efficacy and
efficiency of AccuQuant across various tasks and diffusion models on standard
benchmarks.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the dominant architecture for
visual generation, powering state-of-the-art image and video models. By
representing images as patch tokens with positional encodings (PEs), DiTs
combine Transformer scalability with spatial and temporal inductive biases. In
this work, we revisit how DiTs organize visual content and discover that patch
tokens exhibit a surprising degree of independence: even when PEs are
perturbed, DiTs still produce globally coherent outputs, indicating that
spatial coherence is primarily governed by PEs. Motivated by this finding, we
introduce the Positional Encoding Field (PE-Field), which extends positional
encodings from the 2D plane to a structured 3D field. PE-Field incorporates
depth-aware encodings for volumetric reasoning and hierarchical encodings for
fine-grained sub-patch control, enabling DiTs to model geometry directly in 3D
space. Our PE-Field-augmented DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on
single-image novel view synthesis and generalizes to controllable spatial image
editing.

*Qing Wang,Chong-Wah Ngo,Yu Cao,Ee-Peng Lim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于因果关系的图像-食谱检索方法，通过预测图像中可能被忽略的烹饪元素来缓解跨模态表示学习中的偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像-食谱检索方法假设食物图像能完全捕捉食谱的文本细节，但实际上图像只反映烹饪结果而非过程，导致表示学习偏向主导视觉元素，难以区分具有细微差异的相似食谱。

Method: 采用因果方法预测图像中可能被忽视的烹饪元素，并将这些元素显式注入跨模态表示学习中以减轻偏差。

Result: 在标准单语Recipe1M数据集和新构建的多语言多文化数据集上，该方法能够发现细微的食材和烹饪动作，并在检索性能上取得显著提升。

Conclusion: 因果表示学习能有效缓解图像-食谱检索中的表示偏差问题，在单语和多语言多文化数据集上都表现出优异的检索性能。

Abstract: Existing approaches for image-to-recipe retrieval have the implicit
assumption that a food image can fully capture the details textually documented
in its recipe. However, a food image only reflects the visual outcome of a
cooked dish and not the underlying cooking process. Consequently, learning
cross-modal representations to bridge the modality gap between images and
recipes tends to ignore subtle, recipe-specific details that are not visually
apparent but are crucial for recipe retrieval. Specifically, the
representations are biased to capture the dominant visual elements, resulting
in difficulty in ranking similar recipes with subtle differences in use of
ingredients and cooking methods. The bias in representation learning is
expected to be more severe when the training data is mixed of images and
recipes sourced from different cuisines. This paper proposes a novel causal
approach that predicts the culinary elements potentially overlooked in images,
while explicitly injecting these elements into cross-modal representation
learning to mitigate biases. Experiments are conducted on the standard
monolingual Recipe1M dataset and a newly curated multilingual multicultural
cuisine dataset. The results indicate that the proposed causal representation
learning is capable of uncovering subtle ingredients and cooking actions and
achieves impressive retrieval performance on both monolingual and multilingual
multicultural datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态知识蒸馏方法使用固定权重，无法有效处理医学图像中不同区域的不确定性变化。需要一种能够动态适应不确定性水平的蒸馏方法，提高模型在复杂医学图像分类中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper presents the FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet model, a novel approach for
lung cancer (LC) classification, leveraging dynamic fuzzy logic-driven
knowledge distillation (KD) to address uncertainty and complexity in disease
diagnosis. Unlike traditional models that rely on static KD with fixed weights,
our method dynamically adjusts the distillation weight using fuzzy logic,
enabling the student model to focus on high-confidence regions while reducing
attention to ambiguous areas. This dynamic adjustment improves the model
ability to handle varying uncertainty levels across different regions of LC
images. We employ the Vision Transformer (ViT-B32) as the instructor model,
which effectively transfers knowledge to the student model, MobileNet,
enhancing the student generalization capabilities. The training process is
further optimized using a dynamic wait adjustment mechanism that adapts the
training procedure for improved convergence and performance. To enhance image
quality, we introduce pixel-level image fusion improvement techniques such as
Gamma correction and Histogram Equalization. The processed images (Pix1 and
Pix2) are fused using a wavelet-based fusion method to improve image resolution
and feature preservation. This fusion method uses the wavedec2 function to
standardize images to a 224x224 resolution, decompose them into multi-scale
frequency components, and recursively average coefficients at each level for
better feature representation. To address computational efficiency, Genetic
Algorithm (GA) is used to select the most suitable pre-trained student model
from a pool of 12 candidates, balancing model performance with computational
cost. The model is evaluated on two datasets, including LC25000
histopathological images (99.16% accuracy) and IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan images
(99.54% accuracy), demonstrating robustness across different imaging domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Conan是一个基于证据的多步骤视频推理框架，通过识别上下文和证据帧、推理跨帧线索，并自适应决定何时结束或继续探索，在多个基准测试中超越基线模型10%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于强化学习的视频推理方法依赖纯文本链，容易产生无根据或幻觉的结论；而基于帧检索的方法虽然引入视觉基础，但仍难以准确定位证据。

Method: 构建Conan-91K大规模自动生成推理轨迹数据集，包含帧识别、证据推理和行动决策；设计多阶段渐进冷启动策略与识别-推理-行动(IRA)强化学习训练框架，联合增强多步骤视觉推理。

Result: 在六个多步骤推理基准测试中，Conan平均超越基线Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct超过10%的准确率，达到最先进性能；在长视频理解任务中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Conan框架通过证据基础的多步骤视频推理，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，展现出强大的可扩展性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Video reasoning, which requires multi-step deduction across frames, remains a
major challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While
reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods enhance reasoning capabilities, they
often rely on text-only chains that yield ungrounded or hallucinated
conclusions. Conversely, frame-retrieval approaches introduce visual grounding
but still struggle with inaccurate evidence localization. To address these
challenges, we present Conan, a framework for evidence-grounded multi-step
video reasoning. Conan identifies contextual and evidence frames, reasons over
cross-frame clues, and adaptively decides when to conclude or explore further.
To achieve this, we (1) construct Conan-91K, a large-scale dataset of
automatically generated reasoning traces that includes frame identification,
evidence reasoning, and action decision, and (2) design a multi-stage
progressive cold-start strategy combined with an
Identification-Reasoning-Action (AIR) RLVR training framework to jointly
enhance multi-step visual reasoning. Extensive experiments on six multi-step
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Conan surpasses the baseline
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by an average of over 10% in accuracy, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, Conan generalizes effectively to
long-video understanding tasks, validating its strong scalability and
robustness.

TL;DR: 提出了一种模块化的人口属性推断方法，用于提高人脸分析系统公平性评估的可靠性，通过预训练人脸识别编码器和非线性分类头的组合，在准确性、公平性和鲁棒性方面优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸分析系统的公平性评估通常依赖于自动人口属性推断，但公平性审计的有效性取决于人口属性推断过程的可靠性。需要提高人口属性推断的可靠性来减少公平性评估的偏差和方差。

Method: 采用模块化迁移学习方法，将预训练的人脸识别编码器与非线性分类头相结合，替代传统的端到端训练。提出了基于身份内一致性的鲁棒性度量，适用于任何人口分割方案。

Result: 在多个数据集和训练设置上的性别和种族推断基准测试表明，该方法优于强基线，特别是在更具挑战性的种族属性上表现更好。

Conclusion: 这项工作为公平性审计中的人口属性推断提供了可靠的基础，通过公开数据集元数据、完整代码库、预训练模型和评估工具包来促进透明度和可复现性。

Abstract: Fairness evaluation in face analysis systems (FAS) typically depends on
automatic demographic attribute inference (DAI), which itself relies on
predefined demographic segmentation. However, the validity of fairness auditing
hinges on the reliability of the DAI process. We begin by providing a
theoretical motivation for this dependency, showing that improved DAI
reliability leads to less biased and lower-variance estimates of FAS fairness.
To address this, we propose a fully reproducible DAI pipeline that replaces
conventional end-to-end training with a modular transfer learning approach. Our
design integrates pretrained face recognition encoders with non-linear
classification heads. We audit this pipeline across three dimensions: accuracy,
fairness, and a newly introduced notion of robustness, defined via
intra-identity consistency. The proposed robustness metric is applicable to any
demographic segmentation scheme. We benchmark the pipeline on gender and
ethnicity inference across multiple datasets and training setups. Our results
show that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines, particularly on
ethnicity, which is the more challenging attribute. To promote transparency and
reproducibility, we will publicly release the training dataset metadata, full
codebase, pretrained models, and evaluation toolkit. This work contributes a
reliable foundation for demographic inference in fairness auditing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoDistill是一个双向概念蒸馏框架，用于实现一步扩散个性化(1-SDP)，通过师生模型的协同训练，在保持快速生成的同时有效整合新概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的一步文本到图像扩散模型虽然生成速度快，但在个性化新概念方面能力有限，难以有效捕捉新概念的分布特征。

Method: 采用端到端训练，同时训练多步扩散模型（教师）和一步扩散模型（学生），通过双向概念蒸馏机制，包括概念从教师到学生的蒸馏和从学生到教师的回传，并共享文本编码器确保语义一致性。

Result: 实验表明该框架在1-SDP设置下显著优于现有个性化方法，不仅提升了学生模型对新概念的个性化能力，还改善了教师模型的生成质量。

Conclusion: EchoDistill为T2I扩散模型中的快速有效个性化建立了新范式，通过双向协作机制实现了概念蒸馏和生成质量的同步提升。

Abstract: Recent advances in accelerating text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have
enabled the synthesis of high-fidelity images even in a single step. However,
personalizing these models to incorporate novel concepts remains a challenge
due to the limited capacity of one-step models to capture new concept
distributions effectively. We propose a bidirectional concept distillation
framework, EchoDistill, to enable one-step diffusion personalization (1-SDP).
Our approach involves an end-to-end training process where a multi-step
diffusion model (teacher) and a one-step diffusion model (student) are trained
simultaneously. The concept is first distilled from the teacher model to the
student, and then echoed back from the student to the teacher. During the
EchoDistill, we share the text encoder between the two models to ensure
consistent semantic understanding. Following this, the student model is
optimized with adversarial losses to align with the real image distribution and
with alignment losses to maintain consistency with the teacher's output.
Furthermore, we introduce the bidirectional echoing refinement strategy,
wherein the student model leverages its faster generation capability to
feedback to the teacher model. This bidirectional concept distillation
mechanism not only enhances the student ability to personalize novel concepts
but also improves the generative quality of the teacher model. Our experiments
demonstrate that this collaborative framework significantly outperforms
existing personalization methods over the 1-SDP setup, establishing a novel
paradigm for rapid and effective personalization in T2I diffusion models.

TL;DR: Metis-HOME是一个混合优化的专家混合框架，通过将密集模型分为思考分支和非思考分支来解决多模态推理中的效率与泛化能力权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大推理模型存在两个关键局限：对简单查询也使用计算昂贵的推理导致效率低下，以及专注于专业推理损害了更广泛的通用理解能力。

Method: 将原始密集模型结构化为两个不同的专家分支：思考分支用于复杂多步推理，非思考分支用于快速直接推理。使用轻量级可训练路由器动态分配查询。

Result: 评估显示该方法不仅显著增强了复杂推理能力，还改善了模型的通用能力，逆转了其他推理专用模型中观察到的退化趋势。

Conclusion: 这项工作为构建强大且多功能的多模态大语言模型建立了新范式，有效解决了普遍存在的推理与泛化困境。

Abstract: Inspired by recent advancements in LLM reasoning, the field of multimodal
reasoning has seen remarkable progress, achieving significant performance gains
on intricate tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Despite this progress,
current multimodal large reasoning models exhibit two key limitations. They
tend to employ computationally expensive reasoning even for simple queries,
leading to inefficiency. Furthermore, this focus on specialized reasoning often
impairs their broader, more general understanding capabilities. In this paper,
we propose Metis-HOME: a Hybrid Optimized Mixture-of-Experts framework designed
to address this trade-off. Metis-HOME enables a ''Hybrid Thinking'' paradigm by
structuring the original dense model into two distinct expert branches: a
thinking branch tailored for complex, multi-step reasoning, and a non-thinking
branch optimized for rapid, direct inference on tasks like general VQA and OCR.
A lightweight, trainable router dynamically allocates queries to the most
suitable expert. We instantiate Metis-HOME by adapting the Qwen2.5-VL-7B into
an MoE architecture. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that our approach not
only substantially enhances complex reasoning abilities but also improves the
model's general capabilities, reversing the degradation trend observed in other
reasoning-specialized models. Our work establishes a new paradigm for building
powerful and versatile MLLMs, effectively resolving the prevalent
reasoning-vs-generalization dilemma.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Fake-in-Facext (FiFa)框架，通过细粒度面部区域概念划分和新的Artifact-Grounding Explanation任务，解决了当前多模态大语言模型在可解释深度伪造分析中缺乏细粒度感知能力的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的多模态大语言模型在可解释深度伪造分析中存在细粒度感知不足的问题：数据标注中对伪造痕迹的描述不可靠且粗粒度，模型无法输出文本伪造解释与视觉证据之间的关联，也不支持任意面部区域的查询输入。

Method: 首先定义了面部图像概念树(FICT)来细粒度划分面部区域，建立了FiFa-Annotator数据标注流程。然后提出了Artifact-Grounding Explanation(AGE)任务，生成带有分割掩码的文本伪造解释。最后设计了FiFa-MLLM多任务学习架构，支持丰富的多模态输入输出。

Result: FiFa-MLLM在AGE任务上优于强基线模型，在现有XDFA数据集上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: FiFa框架通过细粒度的数据标注和模型设计，显著提升了可解释深度伪造分析的性能，解决了当前方法在面部视觉上下文中的不足。

Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has bridged the
gap between vision and language tasks, enabling the implementation of
Explainable DeepFake Analysis (XDFA). However, current methods suffer from a
lack of fine-grained awareness: the description of artifacts in data annotation
is unreliable and coarse-grained, and the models fail to support the output of
connections between textual forgery explanations and the visual evidence of
artifacts, as well as the input of queries for arbitrary facial regions. As a
result, their responses are not sufficiently grounded in Face Visual Context
(Facext). To address this limitation, we propose the Fake-in-Facext (FiFa)
framework, with contributions focusing on data annotation and model
construction. We first define a Facial Image Concept Tree (FICT) to divide
facial images into fine-grained regional concepts, thereby obtaining a more
reliable data annotation pipeline, FiFa-Annotator, for forgery explanation.
Based on this dedicated data annotation, we introduce a novel
Artifact-Grounding Explanation (AGE) task, which generates textual forgery
explanations interleaved with segmentation masks of manipulated artifacts. We
propose a unified multi-task learning architecture, FiFa-MLLM, to
simultaneously support abundant multimodal inputs and outputs for fine-grained
Explainable DeepFake Analysis. With multiple auxiliary supervision tasks,
FiFa-MLLM can outperform strong baselines on the AGE task and achieve SOTA
performance on existing XDFA datasets. The code and data will be made
open-source at https://github.com/lxq1000/Fake-in-Facext.

Motivation: 相机抖动导致的大范围或旋转运动模糊仍然是图像恢复中的主要挑战，现有端到端去模糊网络在严重模糊情况下表现不佳。

Method: 使用投影运动模糊模型(PMBM)，通过可微分模糊创建模块预测完整3D旋转轨迹，指导基于模型的端到端训练恢复网络，并通过重模糊损失优化轨迹。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上达到最先进性能，特别是在严重或空间变化模糊情况下表现突出，能够重建生成模糊图像的清晰图像序列。

Conclusion: 该方法通过联合估计相机运动轨迹和清晰图像，提供了可解释的去模糊解决方案，在挑战性模糊场景中优于端到端方法。

Abstract: Motion blur caused by camera shake, particularly under large or rotational
movements, remains a major challenge in image restoration. We propose a deep
learning framework that jointly estimates the latent sharp image and the
underlying camera motion trajectory from a single blurry image. Our method
leverages the Projective Motion Blur Model (PMBM), implemented efficiently
using a differentiable blur creation module compatible with modern networks. A
neural network predicts a full 3D rotation trajectory, which guides a
model-based restoration network trained end-to-end. This modular architecture
provides interpretability by revealing the camera motion that produced the
blur. Moreover, this trajectory enables the reconstruction of the sequence of
sharp images that generated the observed blurry image. To further refine
results, we optimize the trajectory post-inference via a reblur loss, improving
consistency between the blurry input and the restored output. Extensive
experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
synthetic and real datasets, particularly in cases with severe or spatially
variant blur, where end-to-end deblurring networks struggle.

Motivation: 消费级相机系统在复杂光照条件下（如低光、高动态范围、背光）难以保持稳定的图像质量，导致曝光不足、色偏和色调不一致，影响下游视觉任务性能。

Method: 框架包含两个模块：ACamera-Exposure估计ISO以缓解曝光不足和对比度损失，ACamera-Color预测相关色温和增益因子以改善色彩一致性。针对边缘设备实时推理优化，可无缝集成到成像管道中。

Result: 在多样化真实世界数据上训练，模型在不同光照条件下泛化良好。大量实验表明ACamera-Net持续提升图像质量并稳定感知输出，优于传统自动模式和轻量级基线方法。

Conclusion: ACamera-Net无需依赖额外的图像增强模块，就能有效解决复杂光照条件下的相机参数调整问题，提升图像质量和视觉任务性能。

Abstract: Consumer-grade camera systems often struggle to maintain stable image quality
under complex illumination conditions such as low light, high dynamic range,
and backlighting, as well as spatial color temperature variation. These issues
lead to underexposure, color casts, and tonal inconsistency, which degrade the
performance of downstream vision tasks. To address this, we propose
ACamera-Net, a lightweight and scene-adaptive camera parameter adjustment
network that directly predicts optimal exposure and white balance from RAW
inputs. The framework consists of two modules: ACamera-Exposure, which
estimates ISO to alleviate underexposure and contrast loss, and ACamera-Color,
which predicts correlated color temperature and gain factors for improved color
consistency. Optimized for real-time inference on edge devices, ACamera-Net can
be seamlessly integrated into imaging pipelines. Trained on diverse real-world
data with annotated references, the model generalizes well across lighting
conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACamera-Net consistently
enhances image quality and stabilizes perception outputs, outperforming
conventional auto modes and lightweight baselines without relying on additional
image enhancement modules.

Abstract: The realization of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) necessitates
Embodied AI agents capable of robust spatial perception, effective task
planning, and adaptive execution in physical environments. However, current
large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for embodied tasks
suffer from key limitations, including a significant gap between model design

these challenges, we propose EmbodiedBrain, a novel vision-language foundation
model available in both 7B and 32B parameter sizes. Our framework features an
agent-aligned data structure and employs a powerful training methodology that
integrates large-scale Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Step-Augumented Group
Relative Policy Optimization (Step-GRPO), which boosts long-horizon task
success by integrating preceding steps as Guided Precursors. Furthermore, we
incorporate a comprehensive reward system, including a Generative Reward Model

For enable thorough validation, we establish a three-part evaluation system
encompassing General, Planning, and End-to-End Simulation Benchmarks,
highlighted by the proposal and open-sourcing of a novel, challenging
simulation environment. Experimental results demonstrate that EmbodiedBrain
achieves superior performance across all metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for embodied foundation models. Towards paving the way for the

Conclusion: 该模型不仅提高了准确性，其生成的推理轨迹还为测试时扩展提供了有价值的信号，实现了置信度感知验证并提高了答案可靠性。

Abstract: Most video reasoning models only generate textual reasoning traces without
indicating when and where key evidence appears. Recent models such as OpenAI-o3
have sparked wide interest in evidence-centered reasoning for images, yet
extending this ability to videos is more challenging, as it requires joint
temporal tracking and spatial localization across dynamic scenes. We introduce
Open-o3 Video, a non-agent framework that integrates explicit spatio-temporal
evidence into video reasoning, and carefully collect training data and design
training strategies to address the aforementioned challenges. The model
highlights key timestamps, objects, and bounding boxes alongside its answers,
allowing reasoning to be grounded in concrete visual observations. To enable
this functionality, we first curate and build two high-quality datasets,
STGR-CoT-30k for SFT and STGR-RL-36k for RL, with carefully constructed
temporal and spatial annotations, since most existing datasets offer either
temporal spans for videos or spatial boxes on images, lacking unified
spatio-temporal supervision and reasoning traces. Then, we adopt a cold-start
reinforcement learning strategy with multiple specially designed rewards that
jointly encourage answer accuracy, temporal alignment, and spatial precision.
On V-STAR benchmark, Open-o3 Video achieves state-of-the-art performance,
raising mAM by 14.4% and mLGM by 24.2% on the Qwen2.5-VL baseline. Consistent
improvements are also observed on a broad range of video understanding
benchmarks, including VideoMME, WorldSense, VideoMMMU, and TVGBench. Beyond
accuracy, the reasoning traces produced by Open-o3 Video also provide valuable
signals for test-time scaling, enabling confidence-aware verification and
improving answer reliability.

*Muhammad Atif Butt,Alexandra Gomez-Villa,Tao Wu,Javier Vazquez-Corral,Joost Van De Weijer,Kai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了GenColorBench，这是首个全面的文本到图像颜色生成基准，包含44K个颜色相关提示，覆盖400+种颜色，用于评估模型在细粒度颜色控制方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型在细粒度颜色可控性方面表现不佳，无法准确匹配文本提示中指定的颜色。当前基准要么忽略颜色评估，要么依赖粗略评估，缺乏对RGB值解释和人类期望对齐等关键能力的系统评估。

Method: 基于ISCC-NBS和CSS3/X11等颜色系统构建基准，包含数值颜色，通过感知和自动评估揭示模型的真实能力。

Result: 对流行文本到图像模型的评估显示性能存在差异，揭示了模型理解最佳的颜色约定并识别了失败模式。

Conclusion: GenColorBench评估将指导精确颜色生成的改进，基准将在接受后公开。

Abstract: Recent years have seen impressive advances in text-to-image generation, with
image generative or unified models producing high-quality images from text. Yet
these models still struggle with fine-grained color controllability, often
failing to accurately match colors specified in text prompts. While existing
benchmarks evaluate compositional reasoning and prompt adherence, none
systematically assess color precision. Color is fundamental to human visual
perception and communication, critical for applications from art to design
workflows requiring brand consistency. However, current benchmarks either
neglect color or rely on coarse assessments, missing key capabilities such as
interpreting RGB values or aligning with human expectations. To this end, we
propose GenColorBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for text-to-image
color generation, grounded in color systems like ISCC-NBS and CSS3/X11,
including numerical colors which are absent elsewhere. With 44K color-focused
prompts covering 400+ colors, it reveals models' true capabilities via
perceptual and automated assessments. Evaluations of popular text-to-image
models using GenColorBench show performance variations, highlighting which
color conventions models understand best and identifying failure modes. Our
GenColorBench assessments will guide improvements in precise color generation.
The benchmark will be made public upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出基于相似性原型的跨模态分割框架，通过类别原型学习和相似性约束来解决域适应问题，在嵌入空间中实现语义类别的区分性表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在面对未见数据时性能会急剧下降，而跨域标注成本高昂。本文旨在通过无监督域适应方法减少域间差异，避免对未见域进行昂贵标注。

Method: 在嵌入空间中学习类别原型，引入相似性约束使原型对每个语义类别具有代表性且不同类别间可分离。使用字典存储来自不同图像的原型，避免类别缺失问题并支持原型对比学习。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法比其他最先进方法取得了更好的结果。

Conclusion: 基于相似性原型的跨模态分割框架能有效解决域适应问题，通过原型学习和对比学习显著提升性能。

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved great success on various vision
challenges, but a well-trained model would face drastic performance degradation
when applied to unseen data. Since the model is sensitive to domain shift,
unsupervised domain adaptation attempts to reduce the domain gap and avoid
costly annotation of unseen domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for
cross-modality segmentation via similarity-based prototypes. In specific, we
learn class-wise prototypes within an embedding space, then introduce a
similarity constraint to make these prototypes representative for each semantic
class while separable from different classes. Moreover, we use dictionaries to
store prototypes extracted from different images, which prevents the
class-missing problem and enables the contrastive learning of prototypes, and
further improves performance. Extensive experiments show that our method
achieves better results than other state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从单目视频中重建自由移动物体的挑战，特别是在缺乏可靠位姿或深度线索以及物体任意运动的情况下。

Method: 使用第一帧作为重建锚点，通过密集高斯基元场逐步细化对象表示；核心贡献是双键内存模块，结合潜在外观-几何键和显式方向键，通过空间引导内存读取和高效稀疏化机制处理自由移动物体。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理自由移动物体的重建问题，提供高质量的对象中心3D表示，且计算成本与视频序列长度无关。

Abstract: Free-moving object reconstruction from monocular video remains challenging,
particularly without reliable pose or depth cues and under arbitrary object
motion. We introduce OnlineSplatter, a novel online feed-forward framework
generating high-quality, object-centric 3D Gaussians directly from RGB frames
without requiring camera pose, depth priors, or bundle optimization. Our
approach anchors reconstruction using the first frame and progressively refines
the object representation through a dense Gaussian primitive field, maintaining
constant computational cost regardless of video sequence length. Our core
contribution is a dual-key memory module combining latent appearance-geometry
keys with explicit directional keys, robustly fusing current frame features
with temporally aggregated object states. This design enables effective
handling of free-moving objects via spatial-guided memory readout and an
efficient sparsification mechanism, ensuring comprehensive yet compact object
coverage. Evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that OnlineSplatter
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art pose-free reconstruction baselines,
consistently improving with more observations while maintaining constant memory
and runtime.

TL;DR: 提出了SeViCES框架，通过语义-视觉共识证据选择来解决长视频理解中的计算复杂性和推理不一致问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频内容复杂多样且时间分散，现有视频大语言模型处理长序列计算成本高，且容易产生不聚焦或不一致的推理结果

Method: 训练无关且模型无关的框架，包含语义-视觉共识帧选择模块（SVCFS）和答案共识细化模块（ACR），通过时间感知语义分支和聚类引导视觉分支选择关键帧

Result: 在长视频理解基准测试中，SeViCES在准确性和鲁棒性方面持续优于最先进方法

Conclusion: 共识驱动的证据选择对视频大语言模型至关重要，SeViCES框架能有效提升长视频理解性能

Abstract: Long video understanding remains challenging due to its complex, diverse, and
temporally scattered content. Although video large language models (Video-LLMs)
can process videos lasting tens of minutes, applying them to truly long
sequences is computationally prohibitive and often leads to unfocused or
inconsistent reasoning. A promising solution is to select only the most
informative frames, yet existing approaches typically ignore temporal
dependencies or rely on unimodal evidence, limiting their ability to provide
complete and query-relevant context. We propose a Semantic-Visual Consensus
Evidence Selection (SeViCES) framework for effective and reliable long video
understanding. SeViCES is training-free and model-agnostic, and introduces two
key components. The Semantic-Visual Consensus Frame Selection (SVCFS) module
selects frames through (1) a temporal-aware semantic branch that leverages LLM
reasoning over captions, and (2) a cluster-guided visual branch that aligns
embeddings with semantic scores via mutual information. The Answer Consensus
Refinement (ACR) module further resolves inconsistencies between semantic- and
visual-based predictions by fusing evidence and constraining the answer space.
Extensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks show that SeViCES
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and
robustness, demonstrating the importance of consensus-driven evidence selection
for Video-LLMs.

Abstract: Efficient analysis and processing of dental images are crucial for dentists
to achieve accurate diagnosis and optimal treatment planning. However, dental
imaging inherently poses several challenges, such as low contrast, metallic
artifacts, and variations in projection angles. Combined with the subjectivity
arising from differences in clinicians' expertise, manual interpretation often
proves time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. Artificial intelligence
(AI)-based automated dental image analysis (DIA) offers a promising solution to
these issues and has become an integral part of computer-aided dental diagnosis
and treatment. Among various AI technologies, deep learning (DL) stands out as
the most widely applied and influential approach due to its superior feature
extraction and representation capabilities. To comprehensively summarize recent
progress in this field, we focus on the two fundamental aspects of DL
research-datasets and models. In this paper, we systematically review 260
studies on DL applications in DIA, including 49 papers on publicly available
dental datasets and 211 papers on DL-based algorithms. We first introduce the
basic concepts of dental imaging and summarize the characteristics and
acquisition methods of existing datasets. Then, we present the foundational
techniques of DL and categorize relevant models and algorithms according to
different DIA tasks, analyzing their network architectures, optimization
strategies, training methods, and performance. Furthermore, we summarize
commonly used training and evaluation metrics in the DIA domain. Finally, we
discuss the current challenges of existing research and outline potential
future directions. We hope that this work provides a valuable and systematic
reference for researchers in this field. All supplementary materials and
detailed comparison tables will be made publicly available on GitHub.

TL;DR: BTB3D是一种因果卷积编码器-解码器，通过频率感知的3D标记化和三阶段训练课程，在3D医学影像的视觉-语言建模中实现了最先进的报告生成和文本到CT合成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在处理高分辨率、长序列3D医学影像时存在视觉编码器与临床语言不对齐、切片标记化模糊精细解剖结构等问题，限制了诊断性能。

Method: 采用因果卷积编码器-解码器架构，通过三阶段训练课程：(i)局部重建，(ii)重叠窗口平铺，(iii)长上下文解码器精炼，学习从短切片片段泛化到超过300切片的扫描。

Result: 在报告生成任务中，BLEU分数提升且临床F1比CT2Rep、CT-CHAT和Merlin提高40%；在文本到CT合成中，FID降低75%，FVD减半，生成解剖一致的512*512*241体积。

Conclusion: 精确的三维标记化而非仅更大的语言骨干网络，对于3D医学影像中可扩展的视觉-语言建模至关重要。

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language modeling for 3D medical imaging has been
fueled by large-scale computed tomography (CT) corpora with paired free-text
reports, stronger architectures, and powerful pretrained models. This has
enabled applications such as automated report generation and text-conditioned
3D image synthesis. Yet, current approaches struggle with high-resolution,
long-sequence volumes: contrastive pretraining often yields vision encoders
that are misaligned with clinical language, and slice-wise tokenization blurs
fine anatomy, reducing diagnostic performance on downstream tasks. We introduce
BTB3D (Better Tokens for Better 3D), a causal convolutional encoder-decoder
that unifies 2D and 3D training and inference while producing compact,
frequency-aware volumetric tokens. A three-stage training curriculum enables
(i) local reconstruction, (ii) overlapping-window tiling, and (iii)
long-context decoder refinement, during which the model learns from short slice
excerpts yet generalizes to scans exceeding 300 slices without additional
memory overhead. BTB3D sets a new state-of-the-art on two key tasks: it
improves BLEU scores and increases clinical F1 by 40% over CT2Rep, CT-CHAT, and
Merlin for report generation; and it reduces FID by 75% and halves FVD compared
to GenerateCT and MedSyn for text-to-CT synthesis, producing anatomically
consistent 512*512*241 volumes. These results confirm that precise
three-dimensional tokenization, rather than larger language backbones alone, is
essential for scalable vision-language modeling in 3D medical imaging. The

Motivation: 当前超高清文本到图像生成面临两大挑战：缺乏大规模高质量的超高清数据集，以及缺乏针对超高清场景下细粒度细节合成的专门训练策略。

Method: 1) 构建UltraHR-100K数据集，包含10万张分辨率超过3K的高质量图像和丰富描述；2) 提出频率感知后训练方法，包括细节导向时间步采样(DOTS)和软加权频率正则化(SWFR)，利用离散傅里叶变换约束频率分量以保留高频细节。

Conclusion: 通过构建高质量数据集和开发专门的训练策略，成功解决了超高清文本到图像生成中的关键挑战，显著提升了生成图像的细节质量。

Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution (UHR) text-to-image (T2I) generation has seen notable
progress. However, two key challenges remain : 1) the absence of a large-scale
high-quality UHR T2I dataset, and (2) the neglect of tailored training
strategies for fine-grained detail synthesis in UHR scenarios. To tackle the
first challenge, we introduce \textbf{UltraHR-100K}, a high-quality dataset of
100K UHR images with rich captions, offering diverse content and strong visual
fidelity. Each image exceeds 3K resolution and is rigorously curated based on
detail richness, content complexity, and aesthetic quality. To tackle the
second challenge, we propose a frequency-aware post-training method that
enhances fine-detail generation in T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we
design (i) \textit{Detail-Oriented Timestep Sampling (DOTS)} to focus learning
on detail-critical denoising steps, and (ii) \textit{Soft-Weighting Frequency
Regularization (SWFR)}, which leverages Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to
softly constrain frequency components, encouraging high-frequency detail
preservation. Extensive experiments on our proposed UltraHR-eval4K benchmarks
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the fine-grained detail
quality and overall fidelity of UHR image generation. The code is available at

Abstract: Accurate waste classification is vital for achieving sustainable waste
management and reducing the environmental footprint of urbanization.
Misclassification of recyclable materials contributes to landfill accumulation,
inefficient recycling, and increased greenhouse gas emissions. To address these
issues, this study introduces HybridSOMSpikeNet, a hybrid deep learning
framework that integrates convolutional feature extraction, differentiable
self-organization, and spiking-inspired temporal processing to enable
intelligent and energy-efficient waste classification. The proposed model
employs a pre-trained ResNet-152 backbone to extract deep spatial
representations, followed by a Differentiable Soft Self-Organizing Map
(Soft-SOM) that enhances topological clustering and interpretability. A spiking
neural head accumulates temporal activations over discrete time steps,
improving robustness and generalization. Trained on a ten-class waste dataset,
HybridSOMSpikeNet achieved a test accuracy of 97.39%, outperforming several
state-of-the-art architectures while maintaining a lightweight computational
profile suitable for real-world deployment. Beyond its technical innovations,
the framework provides tangible environmental benefits. By enabling precise and
automated waste segregation, it supports higher recycling efficiency, reduces
contamination in recyclable streams, and minimizes the ecological and
operational costs of waste processing. The approach aligns with global
sustainability priorities, particularly the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals (SDG 11 and SDG 12), by contributing to cleaner cities,
circular economy initiatives, and intelligent environmental management systems.

Motivation: 现有的多比特量化网络方法需要为每个支持的比特宽度重复全数据集更新，导致训练开销随精度数量线性增长，且需要额外的微调阶段来支持更多精度选项

Method: 1. 权重偏置校正：通过中和跨比特宽度的量化诱导偏置并对齐激活分布，实现共享批归一化，无需微调；2. 比特级核心集采样：利用隐式知识转移现象，通过基于梯度的重要性评分选择紧凑信息子集进行训练

Result: 在CIFAR-10/100、TinyImageNet和ImageNet-1K数据集上，使用ResNet和ViT架构的实验表明，该方法在达到竞争性或更优准确率的同时，训练时间减少最多7.88倍

Conclusion: 所提出的方法显著降低了多比特量化网络的训练开销，同时保持了模型性能，为灵活部署提供了高效的解决方案

Abstract: Multi-bit quantization networks enable flexible deployment of deep neural
networks by supporting multiple precision levels within a single model.
However, existing approaches suffer from significant training overhead as
full-dataset updates are repeated for each supported bit-width, resulting in a
cost that scales linearly with the number of precisions. Additionally, extra
fine-tuning stages are often required to support additional or intermediate
precision options, further compounding the overall training burden. To address
this issue, we propose two techniques that greatly reduce the training overhead
without compromising model utility: (i) Weight bias correction enables shared
batch normalization and eliminates the need for fine-tuning by neutralizing
quantization-induced bias across bit-widths and aligning activation
distributions; and (ii) Bit-wise coreset sampling strategy allows each child
model to train on a compact, informative subset selected via gradient-based
importance scores by exploiting the implicit knowledge transfer phenomenon.
Experiments on CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-1K with both ResNet and
ViT architectures demonstrate that our method achieves competitive or superior
accuracy while reducing training time up to 7.88x. Our code is released at

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that integrate visual and textual
reasoning leverage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to tackle complex visual
tasks, yet continue to exhibit visual hallucinations and an over-reliance on
textual priors. We present a systematic diagnosis of state-of-the-art
vision-language models using a three-stage evaluation framework, uncovering key
failure modes. To address these, we propose an agent-based architecture that
combines LLM reasoning with lightweight visual modules, enabling fine-grained
analysis and iterative refinement of reasoning chains. Our results highlight
future visual reasoning models should focus on integrating a broader set of
specialized tools for analyzing visual content. Our system achieves significant
gains (+10.3 on MMMU, +6.0 on MathVista over a 7B baseline), matching or
surpassing much larger models. We will release our framework and evaluation

<details>

Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法主要关注保留高重要性KV对，但忽视了多模态KV缓存中出现的模态特定语义冗余模式，导致语义覆盖不足。

Method: MixKV方法分析注意力头间的语义冗余，自适应地平衡多样性和重要性来压缩KV对，能够适应头级别的语义冗余变化。

Result: 在极端压缩（预算=64）下，MixKV将基线方法平均提升5.1%，在GUI接地任务上对SnapKV和AdaKV分别获得8.0%和9.0%的显著增益，同时保持相当的推理效率。

Conclusion: MixKV通过结合重要性和多样性，有效解决了多模态KV缓存压缩中的语义覆盖问题，并能无缝扩展到LLMs中取得可比性能提升。

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in processing extended multi-modal sequences, yet the resulting
key-value (KV) cache expansion creates a critical memory bottleneck that
fundamentally limits deployment scalability. While existing KV cache
compression methods focus on retaining high-importance KV pairs to minimize
storage, they often overlook the modality-specific semantic redundancy patterns
that emerge distinctively in multi-modal KV caches. In this work, we first
analyze how, beyond simple importance, the KV cache in LVLMs exhibits varying
levels of redundancy across attention heads. We show that relying solely on
importance can only cover a subset of the full KV cache information
distribution, leading to potential loss of semantic coverage. To address this,
we propose \texttt{MixKV}, a novel method that mixes importance with diversity
for optimized KV cache compression in LVLMs. \texttt{MixKV} adapts to head-wise
semantic redundancy, selectively balancing diversity and importance when
compressing KV pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{MixKV}
consistently enhances existing methods across multiple LVLMs. Under extreme
compression (budget=64), \texttt{MixKV} improves baseline methods by an average
of \textbf{5.1\%} across five multi-modal understanding benchmarks and achieves
remarkable gains of \textbf{8.0\%} and \textbf{9.0\%} for SnapKV and AdaKV on
GUI grounding tasks, all while maintaining comparable inference efficiency.
Furthermore, \texttt{MixKV} extends seamlessly to LLMs with comparable
performance gains. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LiDAR投影方法存在几何不一致性，导致不可逆的信息损失，影响高保真应用。需要一种能够自动推断LiDAR传感器内在几何参数的方法，实现无损投影。

Method: 通过自动逆向工程推断旋转LiDAR传感器的关键内在参数，包括激光束配置、角度分布和每束激光的校准校正，从而实现无损投影和完整点云重建。

Result: 在完整KITTI和DurLAR数据集上的评估显示，ALICE-LRI实现了完美的点数保持，所有点云中零点数损失，几何精度保持在传感器精度限制内，具有实时性能。

Conclusion: ALICE-LRI实现了从近似到无损LiDAR投影的范式转变，为需要完整几何保持的高精度遥感应用开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: 3D LiDAR sensors are essential for autonomous navigation, environmental
monitoring, and precision mapping in remote sensing applications. To
efficiently process the massive point clouds generated by these sensors, LiDAR
data is often projected into 2D range images that organize points by their
angular positions and distances. While these range image representations enable
efficient processing, conventional projection methods suffer from fundamental
geometric inconsistencies that cause irreversible information loss,
compromising high-fidelity applications. We present ALICE-LRI (Automatic LiDAR
Intrinsic Calibration Estimation for Lossless Range Images), the first general,
sensor-agnostic method that achieves lossless range image generation from
spinning LiDAR point clouds without requiring manufacturer metadata or
calibration files. Our algorithm automatically reverse-engineers the intrinsic
geometry of any spinning LiDAR sensor by inferring critical parameters
including laser beam configuration, angular distributions, and per-beam
calibration corrections, enabling lossless projection and complete point cloud
reconstruction with zero point loss. Comprehensive evaluation across the
complete KITTI and DurLAR datasets demonstrates that ALICE-LRI achieves perfect
point preservation, with zero points lost across all point clouds. Geometric
accuracy is maintained well within sensor precision limits, establishing
geometric losslessness with real-time performance. We also present a
compression case study that validates substantial downstream benefits,
demonstrating significant quality improvements in practical applications. This
paradigm shift from approximate to lossless LiDAR projections opens new
possibilities for high-precision remote sensing applications requiring complete
geometric preservation.

*Yuhan Liu,Lianhui Qin,Shengjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Speculative Verdict (SV)框架，通过结合多个轻量级草稿专家和大型裁决模型，在信息密集型图像上实现高效的多模态推理，无需训练即可提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在信息密集型图像（密集交错文本注释和细粒度图形元素）上推理困难，主要挑战在于精确定位关键线索和整合分散证据的多跳推理。

Method: 采用推测解码思想，在草稿阶段使用小型VLMs生成多样化的定位候选推理路径，在裁决阶段使用强VLM合成这些路径生成最终答案，并引入共识专家选择机制提高效率。

Result: 在InfographicVQA、ChartMuseum、ChartQAPro和HR-Bench 4K等具有挑战性的信息密集和高分辨率视觉问答基准上取得一致性能提升。

Conclusion: SV通过从多个部分准确的推理路径中合成正确见解，相比大型专有模型或训练流程，实现了错误校正和成本效率的平衡。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal understanding, yet they struggle when reasoning over
information-intensive images that densely interleave textual annotations with
fine-grained graphical elements. The main challenges lie in precisely
localizing critical cues in dense layouts and multi-hop reasoning to integrate
dispersed evidence. We propose Speculative Verdict (SV), a training-free
framework inspired by speculative decoding that combines multiple lightweight
draft experts with a large verdict model. In the draft stage, small VLMs act as
draft experts to generate reasoning paths that provide diverse localization
candidates; in the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths to
produce the final answer, minimizing computational cost while recovering
correct answers. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, SV introduces a
consensus expert selection mechanism that forwards only high-agreement
reasoning paths to the verdict. Empirically, SV achieves consistent gains on
challenging information-intensive and high-resolution visual question answering
benchmarks, including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K.
By synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning
paths, SV achieves both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large
proprietary models or training pipelines. Code is available at

TL;DR: AutoScape是一个长时域驾驶场景生成框架，通过RGB-D扩散模型迭代生成稀疏、几何一致的关键帧，然后使用视频扩散模型插值生成密集连贯的视频帧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长时域驾驶视频生成中保持几何一致性的挑战，特别是在复杂动态场景中。

Method: 1) 在共享潜在空间中联合处理图像和深度；2) 显式条件化先前生成关键帧的几何信息；3) 使用扭曲一致性引导采样过程；4) 通过视频扩散模型插值关键帧。

Result: 生成长度超过20秒的真实且几何一致的驾驶视频，长时域FID和FVD分数分别比现有最优方法提升48.6%和43.0%。

Conclusion: AutoScape通过几何一致的关键帧生成和插值方法，有效解决了长时域驾驶场景生成的几何一致性问题，显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: This paper proposes AutoScape, a long-horizon driving scene generation
framework. At its core is a novel RGB-D diffusion model that iteratively
generates sparse, geometrically consistent keyframes, serving as reliable
anchors for the scene's appearance and geometry. To maintain long-range
geometric consistency, the model 1) jointly handles image and depth in a shared
latent space, 2) explicitly conditions on the existing scene geometry (i.e.,
rendered point clouds) from previously generated keyframes, and 3) steers the
sampling process with a warp-consistent guidance. Given high-quality RGB-D
keyframes, a video diffusion model then interpolates between them to produce
dense and coherent video frames. AutoScape generates realistic and
geometrically consistent driving videos of over 20 seconds, improving the
long-horizon FID and FVD scores over the prior state-of-the-art by 48.6\% and
43.0\%, respectively.

TL;DR: DyPE是一种无需训练的方法，通过动态调整扩散过程中的位置编码，使预训练扩散变换器能够生成远超训练分辨率的高质量图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器在超高分辨率图像生成时面临自注意力机制二次方计算成本的问题，训练成本极高。

Method: 利用扩散过程的光谱特性，在每一步扩散过程中动态调整位置编码，使其频率谱与当前生成阶段匹配。

Result: 能够生成1600万像素的图像，在多个基准测试中持续提升性能，在超高分辨率图像生成中达到最先进的保真度。

Conclusion: DyPE提供了一种高效的无训练方法，显著扩展了预训练扩散变换器的分辨率生成能力。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer models can generate images with remarkable fidelity and
detail, yet training them at ultra-high resolutions remains extremely costly
due to the self-attention mechanism's quadratic scaling with the number of
image tokens. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Position Extrapolation
(DyPE), a novel, training-free method that enables pre-trained diffusion
transformers to synthesize images at resolutions far beyond their training
data, with no additional sampling cost. DyPE takes advantage of the spectral
progression inherent to the diffusion process, where low-frequency structures
converge early, while high-frequencies take more steps to resolve.
Specifically, DyPE dynamically adjusts the model's positional encoding at each
diffusion step, matching their frequency spectrum with the current stage of the
generative process. This approach allows us to generate images at resolutions
that exceed the training resolution dramatically, e.g., 16 million pixels using
FLUX. On multiple benchmarks, DyPE consistently improves performance and
achieves state-of-the-art fidelity in ultra-high-resolution image generation,
with gains becoming even more pronounced at higher resolutions. Project page is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: α-Flow通过解耦MeanFlow中的冲突目标，采用课程学习策略从轨迹流匹配平滑过渡到MeanFlow，在ImageNet-1K 256x256上取得了SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现MeanFlow目标自然分解为轨迹流匹配和轨迹一致性两个部分，这两个术语存在强负相关性，导致优化冲突和收敛缓慢。

Method: 提出α-Flow框架，统一轨迹流匹配、Shortcut Model和MeanFlow，采用课程学习策略平滑地从轨迹流匹配过渡到MeanFlow。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K 256x256上，α-Flow始终优于MeanFlow，最大的α-Flow-XL/2+模型使用标准DiT骨干网络取得了FID 2.58(1-NFE)和2.15(2-NFE)的SOTA结果。

Conclusion: α-Flow通过解耦冲突目标实现了更好的收敛性能，为少步生成建模提供了有效的优化框架。

Abstract: MeanFlow has recently emerged as a powerful framework for few-step generative
modeling trained from scratch, but its success is not yet fully understood. In
this work, we show that the MeanFlow objective naturally decomposes into two
parts: trajectory flow matching and trajectory consistency. Through gradient
analysis, we find that these terms are strongly negatively correlated, causing
optimization conflict and slow convergence. Motivated by these insights, we
introduce $\alpha$-Flow, a broad family of objectives that unifies trajectory
flow matching, Shortcut Model, and MeanFlow under one formulation. By adopting
a curriculum strategy that smoothly anneals from trajectory flow matching to
MeanFlow, $\alpha$-Flow disentangles the conflicting objectives, and achieves
better convergence. When trained from scratch on class-conditional ImageNet-1K
256x256 with vanilla DiT backbones, $\alpha$-Flow consistently outperforms
MeanFlow across scales and settings. Our largest $\alpha$-Flow-XL/2+ model
achieves new state-of-the-art results using vanilla DiT backbones, with FID
scores of 2.58 (1-NFE) and 2.15 (2-NFE).

TL;DR: Cupid是一种基于生成的单图像3D重建方法，通过条件采样过程联合估计相机姿态、3D形状和纹理，采用两阶段流匹配框架实现精确重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从单张2D图像准确推断相机姿态、3D形状和纹理是计算机视觉中的关键挑战，现有方法在姿态估计和形状重建的联合优化方面存在局限。

Method: 将3D重建建模为条件采样过程，采用两阶段流匹配：粗阶段生成初始几何和2D投影用于姿态恢复，精阶段集成姿态对齐图像特征以增强结构保真度和外观细节。

Result: 在广泛实验中，Cupid优于领先的3D重建方法，PSNR增益超过3dB，Chamfer距离减少超过10%，在姿态精度上匹配单目估计器，视觉保真度优于基线3D生成模型。

Conclusion: Cupid通过统一的生成框架实现了鲁棒的姿态和形状估计，为单图像3D重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This work proposes a new generation-based 3D reconstruction method, named
Cupid, that accurately infers the camera pose, 3D shape, and texture of an
object from a single 2D image. Cupid casts 3D reconstruction as a conditional
sampling process from a learned distribution of 3D objects, and it jointly
generates voxels and pixel-voxel correspondences, enabling robust pose and
shape estimation under a unified generative framework. By representing both
input camera poses and 3D shape as a distribution in a shared 3D latent space,
Cupid adopts a two-stage flow matching pipeline: (1) a coarse stage that
produces initial 3D geometry with associated 2D projections for pose recovery;
and (2) a refinement stage that integrates pose-aligned image features to
enhance structural fidelity and appearance details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate Cupid outperforms leading 3D reconstruction methods with an over 3
dB PSNR gain and an over 10% Chamfer Distance reduction, while matching
monocular estimators on pose accuracy and delivering superior visual fidelity
over baseline 3D generative models. For an immersive view of the 3D results

TL;DR: 提出了一种融合雷达和相机数据的多目标跟踪框架，通过在线雷达-相机标定简化传感器集成，利用共同特征提升跟踪精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究往往低估雷达的作用，仅将其作为辅助传感器，而雷达实际上能提供目标在世界3D坐标系中的精确距离/深度信息。本文旨在充分发挥雷达的关键作用。

Method: 开发雷达-相机融合MOT框架，利用在线雷达-相机标定简化传感器检测结果集成；使用雷达和相机数据的共同特征准确推导检测对象的真实世界位置；采用特征匹配和类别一致性检查超越单纯位置匹配的限制。

Result: 在受控环境和实际交通场景中的实验证明，该框架能够简化雷达-相机映射过程并提高跟踪精度。

Conclusion: 这是首个研究雷达-相机共同特征集成及其在在线标定中用于实现MOT的工作，通过充分发挥雷达的关键作用，显著提升了多目标跟踪的性能。

Abstract: This paper presents a Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) framework that fuses radar
and camera data to enhance tracking efficiency while minimizing manual
interventions. Contrary to many studies that underutilize radar and assign it a
supplementary role--despite its capability to provide accurate range/depth
information of targets in a world 3D coordinate system--our approach positions
radar in a crucial role. Meanwhile, this paper utilizes common features to
enable online calibration to autonomously associate detections from radar and
camera. The main contributions of this work include: (1) the development of a
radar-camera fusion MOT framework that exploits online radar-camera calibration
to simplify the integration of detection results from these two sensors, (2)
the utilization of common features between radar and camera data to accurately
derive real-world positions of detected objects, and (3) the adoption of
feature matching and category-consistency checking to surpass the limitations
of mere position matching in enhancing sensor association accuracy. To the best
of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the integration of
radar-camera common features and their use in online calibration for achieving
MOT. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated by its ability to streamline
the radar-camera mapping process and improve tracking precision, as evidenced
by real-world experiments conducted in both controlled environments and actual
traffic scenarios. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出ARGenSeg框架，通过自回归图像生成实现图像分割，将多模态理解和像素级感知统一到一个框架中，显著提升了推理速度和分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将图像分割集成到多模态大语言模型中时，通常使用边界点表示或专用分割头，这些方法依赖离散表示或语义提示，限制了MLLM捕捉细粒度视觉细节的能力。

Method: 基于图像生成的分割框架，利用MLLM输出视觉token，通过通用VQ-VAE将其解码为图像，使分割完全依赖于MLLM的像素级理解。采用下一尺度预测策略并行生成视觉token以减少推理延迟。

Result: 在多个分割数据集上超越了现有最先进方法，推理速度显著提升，同时保持了强大的理解能力。

Conclusion: ARGenSeg框架成功地将多模态理解和像素级感知统一起来，通过图像生成方法实现了高效准确的分割，为MLLM在视觉任务中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: We propose a novel AutoRegressive Generation-based paradigm for image
Segmentation (ARGenSeg), achieving multimodal understanding and pixel-level
perception within a unified framework. Prior works integrating image
segmentation into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically employ
either boundary points representation or dedicated segmentation heads. These
methods rely on discrete representations or semantic prompts fed into
task-specific decoders, which limits the ability of the MLLM to capture
fine-grained visual details. To address these challenges, we introduce a
segmentation framework for MLLM based on image generation, which naturally
produces dense masks for target objects. We leverage MLLM to output visual
tokens and detokenize them into images using an universal VQ-VAE, making the
segmentation fully dependent on the pixel-level understanding of the MLLM. To
reduce inference latency, we employ a next-scale-prediction strategy to
generate required visual tokens in parallel. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses prior state-of-the-art approaches on multiple
segmentation datasets with a remarkable boost in inference speed, while
maintaining strong understanding capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出基于纯Transformer的自回归视频预测模型，在物理模拟数据集上实现更长时间跨度的准确预测，比现有方法延长50%预测时间，同时保持视频质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受自回归大语言模型启发，将Transformer应用于视频预测领域，特别关注物理模拟的时间因果建模，解决现有视频生成方法在时空推理方面的不足。

Method: 使用纯Transformer架构，比较不同时空自注意力布局，采用连续像素空间表示进行自回归视频预测，无需复杂训练策略或潜在特征学习组件。

Result: 在物理模拟数据集上，相比潜在空间方法，物理准确预测的时间跨度延长50%，在常见视频质量指标上表现相当，并通过可解释性实验识别了编码PDE模拟参数信息的网络区域。

Conclusion: 该工作为基于注意力的时空视频建模提供了一个简单、参数高效且可解释的平台，能够泛化到分布外模拟参数的估计。

Abstract: Inspired by the performance and scalability of autoregressive large language
models (LLMs), transformer-based models have seen recent success in the visual
domain. This study investigates a transformer adaptation for video prediction
with a simple end-to-end approach, comparing various spatiotemporal
self-attention layouts. Focusing on causal modeling of physical simulations
over time; a common shortcoming of existing video-generative approaches, we
attempt to isolate spatiotemporal reasoning via physical object tracking
metrics and unsupervised training on physical simulation datasets. We introduce
a simple yet effective pure transformer model for autoregressive video
prediction, utilizing continuous pixel-space representations for video
prediction. Without the need for complex training strategies or latent
feature-learning components, our approach significantly extends the time
horizon for physically accurate predictions by up to 50% when compared with
existing latent-space approaches, while maintaining comparable performance on
common video quality metrics. In addition, we conduct interpretability
experiments to identify network regions that encode information useful to
perform accurate estimations of PDE simulation parameters via probing models,
and find that this generalizes to the estimation of out-of-distribution
simulation parameters. This work serves as a platform for further
attention-based spatiotemporal modeling of videos via a simple, parameter
efficient, and interpretable approach.

TL;DR: 提出SpectraMorph框架，通过物理引导的自监督融合方法解决高光谱图像超分辨率问题，使用解混瓶颈结构，在MSI波段极少时仍保持鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱传感器空间分辨率低导致边界模糊和混合像素问题，现有深度学习方法缺乏可解释性且在MSI波段很少时效果不佳。

Method: 采用物理引导的自监督融合框架，通过解混瓶颈：从低分辨率HSI提取端元特征，用多层感知机从MSI预测丰度图，通过线性混合重建光谱，使用MSI传感器光谱响应函数进行自监督训练。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，SpectraMorph始终优于最先进的无监督/自监督基线方法，与监督基线方法相比也很有竞争力。

Conclusion: SpectraMorph产生可解释的中间结果，训练时间不到一分钟，即使在单波段MSI情况下仍保持鲁棒性，为高光谱超分辨率提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral sensors capture dense spectra per pixel but suffer from low
spatial resolution, causing blurred boundaries and mixed-pixel effects.
Co-registered companion sensors such as multispectral, RGB, or panchromatic
cameras provide high-resolution spatial detail, motivating hyperspectral
super-resolution through the fusion of hyperspectral and multispectral images
(HSI-MSI). Existing deep learning based methods achieve strong performance but
rely on opaque regressors that lack interpretability and often fail when the
MSI has very few bands. We propose SpectraMorph, a physics-guided
self-supervised fusion framework with a structured latent space. Instead of
direct regression, SpectraMorph enforces an unmixing bottleneck: endmember
signatures are extracted from the low-resolution HSI, and a compact multilayer
perceptron predicts abundance-like maps from the MSI. Spectra are reconstructed
by linear mixing, with training performed in a self-supervised manner via the
MSI sensor's spectral response function. SpectraMorph produces interpretable
intermediates, trains in under a minute, and remains robust even with a
single-band (pan-chromatic) MSI. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets show SpectraMorph consistently outperforming state-of-the-art
unsupervised/self-supervised baselines while remaining very competitive against
supervised baselines.

Motivation: 扩散模型在单模态领域表现出色，但扩展到跨模态转换仍面临挑战。现有方法存在维度共享、高斯先验和模态特定架构等限制，缺乏通用性和理论基础。

Method: 在共享潜在空间中操作，引入对比对齐损失确保语义一致性，设计领域无关的编码器-解码器架构用于潜在空间噪声预测，并提出预测损失指导跨域转换训练。

Result: 在多种模态转换任务中表现优异，包括多视图到3D形状生成、图像超分辨率和多视图场景合成，通过综合实验验证了框架有效性。

Conclusion: LDDBM为通用模态转换建立了新的强基线，支持任意模态对，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have positioned diffusion models as
state-of-the-art tools for sampling from complex data distributions. While
these models have shown remarkable success across single-modality domains such
as images and audio, extending their capabilities to Modality Translation (MT),
translating information across different sensory modalities, remains an open
challenge. Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, including
shared dimensionality, Gaussian source priors, and modality-specific
architectures, which limit their generality and theoretical grounding. In this
work, we propose the Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM), a
general-purpose framework for modality translation based on a latent-variable
extension of Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models. By operating in a shared latent
space, our method learns a bridge between arbitrary modalities without
requiring aligned dimensions. We introduce a contrastive alignment loss to
enforce semantic consistency between paired samples and design a
domain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture tailored for noise prediction in
latent space. Additionally, we propose a predictive loss to guide training
toward accurate cross-domain translation and explore several training
strategies to improve stability. Our approach supports arbitrary modality pairs
and performs strongly on diverse MT tasks, including multi-view to 3D shape
generation, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis.
Comprehensive experiments and ablations validate the effectiveness of our
framework, establishing a new strong baseline in general modality translation.

TL;DR: LayerComposer是一个交互式多主体个性化文本到图像生成框架，通过分层画布和锁定机制实现精确的空间控制和身份保持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有个性化生成模型缺乏对空间组合的交互控制，且难以扩展到多主体场景。

Method: 引入分层画布表示，每个主体位于独立层实现无遮挡组合；提出锁定机制，保持选定层高保真度，同时让其他层灵活适应上下文。

Result: 实验表明LayerComposer在多主体个性化图像生成中实现了优于现有方法的空间控制和身份保持。

Conclusion: LayerComposer通过直观的分层操作提供专业级图像编辑体验，无需架构更改即可实现精确的多主体控制。

Abstract: Despite their impressive visual fidelity, existing personalized generative
models lack interactive control over spatial composition and scale poorly to
multiple subjects. To address these limitations, we present LayerComposer, an
interactive framework for personalized, multi-subject text-to-image generation.
Our approach introduces two main contributions: (1) a layered canvas, a novel
representation in which each subject is placed on a distinct layer, enabling
occlusion-free composition; and (2) a locking mechanism that preserves selected
layers with high fidelity while allowing the remaining layers to adapt flexibly
to the surrounding context. Similar to professional image-editing software, the
proposed layered canvas allows users to place, resize, or lock input subjects
through intuitive layer manipulation. Our versatile locking mechanism requires
no architectural changes, relying instead on inherent positional embeddings
combined with a new complementary data sampling strategy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that LayerComposer achieves superior spatial control and identity
preservation compared to the state-of-the-art methods in multi-subject
personalized image generation.

TL;DR: HoloCine是一个文本到视频生成模型，能够生成具有全局一致性的多镜头叙事场景，解决了现有模型在叙事连贯性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文本到视频模型在生成连贯多镜头叙事方面的局限性，填补"叙事鸿沟"，实现从片段合成到自动化电影制作的转变。

Method: 采用窗口交叉注意力机制将文本提示定位到特定镜头，并使用稀疏镜头间自注意力模式（镜头内密集、镜头间稀疏）确保分钟级生成的效率。

Result: 在叙事连贯性方面达到新的最先进水平，并展现出对角色和场景的持久记忆以及对电影技术的直观理解等新兴能力。

Conclusion: HoloCine标志着从片段合成向自动化电影制作的关键转变，使端到端的电影创作成为可实现的未来。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-video models excel at generating isolated clips but
fall short of creating the coherent, multi-shot narratives, which are the
essence of storytelling. We bridge this "narrative gap" with HoloCine, a model
that generates entire scenes holistically to ensure global consistency from the
first shot to the last. Our architecture achieves precise directorial control
through a Window Cross-Attention mechanism that localizes text prompts to
specific shots, while a Sparse Inter-Shot Self-Attention pattern (dense within
shots but sparse between them) ensures the efficiency required for minute-scale
generation. Beyond setting a new state-of-the-art in narrative coherence,
HoloCine develops remarkable emergent abilities: a persistent memory for
characters and scenes, and an intuitive grasp of cinematic techniques. Our work
marks a pivotal shift from clip synthesis towards automated filmmaking, making
end-to-end cinematic creation a tangible future. Our code is available at:
