Conclusion: INSEva基准填补了保险领域AI评估的空白，揭示了LLM在该领域的当前局限性和改进空间，基准将公开发布。

Abstract: Insurance, as a critical component of the global financial system, demands
high standards of accuracy and reliability in AI applications. While existing
benchmarks evaluate AI capabilities across various domains, they often fail to
capture the unique characteristics and requirements of the insurance domain. To
address this gap, we present INSEva, a comprehensive Chinese benchmark
specifically designed for evaluating AI systems' knowledge and capabilities in
insurance. INSEva features a multi-dimensional evaluation taxonomy covering
business areas, task formats, difficulty levels, and cognitive-knowledge
dimension, comprising 38,704 high-quality evaluation examples sourced from
authoritative materials. Our benchmark implements tailored evaluation methods
for assessing both faithfulness and completeness in open-ended responses.
Through extensive evaluation of 8 state-of-the-art Large Language Models
(LLMs), we identify significant performance variations across different
dimensions. While general LLMs demonstrate basic insurance domain competency
with average scores above 80, substantial gaps remain in handling complex,
real-world insurance scenarios. The benchmark will be public soon.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has unlocked boundless
possibilities, along with significant challenges. In response, we developed a
mental health support chatbot designed to augment professional healthcare, with
a strong emphasis on safe and meaningful application. Our approach involved
rigorous evaluation, covering accuracy, empathy, trustworthiness, privacy, and
bias. We employed a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework, integrated
prompt engineering, and fine-tuned a pre-trained model on novel datasets. The
resulting system, Mentalic Net Conversational AI, achieved a BERT Score of
0.898, with other evaluation metrics falling within satisfactory ranges. We
advocate for a human-in-the-loop approach and a long-term, responsible strategy
in developing such transformative technologies, recognizing both their
potential to change lives and the risks they may pose if not carefully managed.

### [3] [Do MLLMs Really Understand the Charts?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04457)
*Xiao Zhang,Dongyuan Li,Liuyu Xiang,Yao Zhang,Cheng Zhong,Zhaofeng He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了ChartReasoner方法，通过模拟人类视觉推理来解决MLLMs在非标注图表理解中的幻觉问题，在CRBench基准测试中表现优于GPT-4o和Gemini-2.5-Flash。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在图表理解中存在严重的幻觉问题，特别是在处理非标注图表时性能显著下降，需要验证模型是否真正理解图表而不仅仅是识别。

Method: 提出了ChartReasoner方法，通过模拟人类行为，将估计建立在图表理解的基础上，引导MLLMs进行合理的图表理解。

Result: 在CRBench基准测试中，ChartReasoner-3B/7B在图表推理方面取得了优越性能，甚至超越了GPT-4o和Gemini-2.5-Flash，同时在公共基准测试中也展现出视觉推理能力。

Conclusion: ChartReasoner方法能够显著提升MLLMs的图表理解能力，使模型能够理性地理解图表，代码和数据集将在发表后公开。

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
increasingly impressive performance in chart understanding, most of them
exhibit alarming hallucinations and significant performance degradation when
handling non-annotated charts. Therefore, a question arises: Do MLLMs really
understand the charts? Since a human is capable of understanding charts and
estimating the values by visual reasoning, we first carefully establish a
comprehensive Chart Reasoning Benchmark CRBench to rigorously evaluate the
visual reasoning abilities of MLLMs on non-annotated charts. We argue that
MLLMs are primarily relying on recognition rather than reasoning to interpret
the charts. To steer MLLMs to reasonable chart understanding, we propose
ChartReasoner that mimics human behavior by grounding their estimation in chart
understanding. Extensive results on the proposed CRBench show that
ChartReasnoner-3B/7B achieves superior performance in chart reasoning, even
compared to GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash. More importantly, ChartReasnoner also
demonstrates the visual reasoning abilities in general chart comprehension on
public benchmarks, leading to significant performance gains and enabling MLLMs
to rationally understand the charts. The code and dataset will be publicly
available upon publication.

### [4] [Predicting Failures of LLMs to Link Biomedical Ontology Terms to Identifiers Evidence Across Models and Ontologies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04458)
*Daniel B. Hier,Steven Keith Platt,Tayo Obafemi-Ajayi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究发现，大语言模型在生物医学NLP任务中表现良好，但在将本体术语链接到正确标识符时容易失败，其中标识符曝光度是链接成功的最强预测因子。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型在生物医学本体术语链接任务中失败的原因，特别是在Human Phenotype Ontology和Gene Ontology两个主要本体上的表现。

Method: 使用GPT-4o和LLaMa 3.1 405B两个高性能模型，评估9个与术语熟悉度、标识符使用、形态学和本体结构相关的候选特征，进行单变量和多变量分析。

Result: 分析表明，本体标识符的曝光度是链接成功的最强预测因子，其他特征如术语熟悉度、形态学特征等对链接成功的影响相对较小。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在生物医学本体术语链接任务中的性能主要取决于对本体标识符的熟悉程度，这为改进模型在该领域的表现提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large language models often perform well on biomedical NLP tasks but may fail
to link ontology terms to their correct identifiers. We investigate why these
failures occur by analyzing predictions across two major ontologies, Human
Phenotype Ontology and Gene Ontology, and two high-performing models, GPT-4o
and LLaMa 3.1 405B. We evaluate nine candidate features related to term
familiarity, identifier usage, morphology, and ontology structure. Univariate
and multivariate analyses show that exposure to ontology identifiers is the
strongest predictor of linking success.

### [5] [Uncertainty-Aware Collaborative System of Large and Small Models for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04459)
*Shiqin Han,Manning Gao,Menghua Jiang,Yuncheng Jiang,Haifeng Hu,Sijie Mai*

Main category: cs.CL

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大型语言模型(MLLM)计算成本高与小型专门模型性能低之间的矛盾，寻求性能效率的最佳平衡。

Method: 设计不确定性驱动的级联机制：轻量模型先行过滤，仅将高不确定性的困难样本提交给MLLM处理。采用权重平均和提示词验证等策略处理模糊或冲突预测。

Result: 在标准数据集上达到最先进性能，同时只需稍少计算资源，显著降低了推理成本。

Conclusion: U-ACS系统有效解决了多模态情感分析中的性能效率矛盾，为实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has significantly
advanced the state-of-the-art in multimodal machine learning, yet their
substantial computational demands present a critical barrier to real-world
deployment. Conversely, smaller, specialized models offer high efficiency but
often at the cost of performance. To reconcile this performance-efficiency
trade-off, we propose a novel Uncertainty-Aware Collaborative System (U-ACS)
that synergistically orchestrates a powerful MLLM (e.g., HumanOmni) and a
lightweight baseline model for multimodal sentiment analysis. The core of our
system is an uncertainty-driven cascade mechanism, where the efficient small
model first acts as a rapid filter for all input samples. Only those samples
yielding high predictive uncertainty, thereby indicating greater difficulty,
are selectively escalated to the MLLM for more sophisticated analysis.
Furthermore, our system introduces advanced strategies to handle ambiguous or
conflicting predictions, including weighted averaging for predictions of
similar polarity and a prompt-based cross-verification to resolve conflicting
predictions when both models exhibit high uncertainty. This
sample-difficulty-aware approach allows for a dynamic allocation of
computational resources, drastically reducing inference costs while retaining
the high accuracy of MLLM. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
while requiring only a fraction of the computational resources compared to
using a standalone MLLM.

### [6] [CoCoNUTS: Concentrating on Content while Neglecting Uninformative Textual Styles for AI-Generated Peer Review Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04460)
*Yihan Chen,Jiawei Chen,Guozhao Mo,Xuanang Chen,Ben He,Xianpei Han,Le Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了CoCoNUTS基准和CoCoDet检测器，从基于风格的检测转向基于内容的检测，以更准确识别AI生成的同行评审内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在同行评审中的使用增加，但现有AI文本检测器依赖风格线索，容易受到改写攻击，无法区分语言润色和实质性内容生成，影响学术评价的公平性和可靠性。

Method: 构建了细粒度的人类-AI协作数据集，开发了CoCoNUTS内容导向基准，并通过多任务学习框架设计了CoCoDet AI评审检测器。

Result: 提出了更准确、鲁棒的AI参与检测方法，能够更好地区分允许的AI辅助语言增强和欺骗性的人类化AI生成评审。

Conclusion: 该工作为评估LLM在同行评审中的使用提供了实践基础，有助于开发更精确、公平和可靠的检测方法，促进学术应用的可信度。

Abstract: The growing integration of large language models (LLMs) into the peer review
process presents potential risks to the fairness and reliability of scholarly
evaluation. While LLMs offer valuable assistance for reviewers with language
refinement, there is growing concern over their use to generate substantive
review content. Existing general AI-generated text detectors are vulnerable to
paraphrasing attacks and struggle to distinguish between surface language
refinement and substantial content generation, suggesting that they primarily
rely on stylistic cues. When applied to peer review, this limitation can result
in unfairly suspecting reviews with permissible AI-assisted language
enhancement, while failing to catch deceptively humanized AI-generated reviews.
To address this, we propose a paradigm shift from style-based to content-based
detection. Specifically, we introduce CoCoNUTS, a content-oriented benchmark
built upon a fine-grained dataset of AI-generated peer reviews, covering six
distinct modes of human-AI collaboration. Furthermore, we develop CoCoDet, an
AI review detector via a multi-task learning framework, designed to achieve
more accurate and robust detection of AI involvement in review content. Our
work offers a practical foundation for evaluating the use of LLMs in peer
review, and contributes to the development of more precise, equitable, and
reliable detection methods for real-world scholarly applications. Our code and
data will be publicly available at https://github.com/Y1hanChen/COCONUTS.

### [7] [From Post To Personality: Harnessing LLMs for MBTI Prediction in Social Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04461)
*Tian Ma,Kaiyu Feng,Yu Rong,Kangfei Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PtoP是一个基于大语言模型的MBTI人格预测框架，通过检索增强生成和合成少数类过采样技术，解决了LLM幻觉问题和MBTI类型不平衡分布问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习和深度学习方法在MBTI人格预测中存在局限性，而直接使用大语言模型面临幻觉问题和类型不平衡分布的挑战。

Method: 提出PtoP框架，结合检索增强生成技术缓解LLM幻觉，使用合成少数类过采样平衡数据分布，并对预训练LLM进行微调。

Result: 在真实社交媒体数据集上的实验表明，PtoP相比10个ML和DL基线方法取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PtoP框架有效解决了LLM在MBTI预测中的关键挑战，为社交媒体人格分析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Personality prediction from social media posts is a critical task that
implies diverse applications in psychology and sociology. The Myers Briggs Type
Indicator (MBTI), a popular personality inventory, has been traditionally
predicted by machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. Recently,
the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revealed their huge potential
in understanding and inferring personality traits from social media content.
However, directly exploiting LLMs for MBTI prediction faces two key challenges:
the hallucination problem inherent in LLMs and the naturally imbalanced
distribution of MBTI types in the population. In this paper, we propose
PostToPersonality (PtoP), a novel LLM based framework for MBTI prediction from
social media posts of individuals. Specifically, PtoP leverages Retrieval
Augmented Generation with in context learning to mitigate hallucination in
LLMs. Furthermore, we fine tune a pretrained LLM to improve model specification
in MBTI understanding with synthetic minority oversampling, which balances the
class imbalance by generating synthetic samples. Experiments conducted on a
real world social media dataset demonstrate that PtoP achieves state of the art
performance compared with 10 ML and DL baselines.

### [8] [Benchmarking GPT-5 for biomedical natural language processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04462)
*Yu Hou,Zaifu Zhan,Rui Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GPT-5在生物医学NLP基准测试中表现最佳，在问答任务上超越监督SOTA 50+分，但在信息抽取和摘要任务上仍落后于领域专用模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生物医学文献的快速增长，需要评估大型语言模型在生物医学NLP任务上的性能，以指导实际系统设计

Method: 使用标准化的BioNLP基准测试，在12个数据集上评估GPT-5和GPT-4o的零样本、单样本和五样本提示性能，涵盖6类任务

Result: GPT-5在五样本提示下获得0.557的宏平均分，优于GPT-4(0.506)和GPT-4o(0.508)；在MedQA上达到94.1%准确率，超越监督SOTA 50+分

Conclusion: GPT-5已成为通用模型，在推理型生物医学问答任务上达到部署就绪水平，但精确性要求高的抽取和证据密集的摘要任务仍需微调或混合方法

Abstract: The rapid expansion of biomedical literature has heightened the need for
scalable natural language processing (NLP) solutions. While GPT-4 substantially
narrowed the gap with task-specific systems, especially in question answering,
its performance across other domains remained uneven. We updated a standardized
BioNLP benchmark to evaluate GPT-5 and GPT-4o under zero-, one-, and five-shot
prompting across 12 datasets spanning six task families: named entity
recognition, relation extraction, multi-label document classification, question
answering, text summarization, and text simplification. Using fixed prompt
templates, identical decoding parameters, and batch inference, we report
primary metrics per dataset and include prior results for GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and
LLaMA-2-13B for comparison. GPT-5 achieved the strongest overall benchmark
performance, with macro-average scores rising to 0.557 under five-shot
prompting versus 0.506 for GPT-4 and 0.508 for GPT-4o. On MedQA, GPT-5 reached
94.1% accuracy, exceeding the previous supervised state of the art by over
fifty points, and attained parity with supervised systems on PubMedQA (0.734).
In extraction tasks, GPT-5 delivered major gains in chemical NER (0.886 F1) and
ChemProt relation extraction (0.616 F1), outperforming GPT-4 and GPT-4o, though
summarization and disease NER still lagged behind domain-specific baselines.
These results establish GPT-5 as a general-purpose model now offering
deployment-ready performance for reasoning-oriented biomedical QA, while
precision-critical extraction and evidence-dense summarization continue to
favor fine-tuned or hybrid approaches. The benchmark delineates where simple
prompting suffices and where retrieval-augmented or planning-based scaffolds
are likely required, providing actionable guidance for BioNLP system design as
frontier models advance.

### [9] [Can Multiple Responses from an LLM Reveal the Sources of Its Uncertainty?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04464)
*Yang Nan,Pengfei He,Ravi Tandon,Han Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种通过分析LLM多个生成响应之间的分歧模式来诊断不确定性来源的方法，使用辅助LLM来分析不确定性的根本原因，如输入模糊性、知识缺乏等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然取得了重大突破，但仍会产生不可靠或误导性输出，当前研究主要关注量化模型不确定性，而很少关注诊断不确定性的来源。

Method: 收集目标LLM的多个响应，使用辅助LLM分析其分歧模式，让辅助模型推理不确定性可能来源（输入模糊性、知识缺乏等），并在知识缺乏情况下识别具体缺失的事实或概念。

Result: 在AmbigQA、OpenBookQA和MMLU-Pro数据集上验证了该框架的有效性，证实了其在诊断不同不确定性来源方面的通用性。

Conclusion: 这种不确定性诊断方法显示了通过相关人工干预来提高LLM性能和可靠性的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have delivered significant breakthroughs across
diverse domains but can still produce unreliable or misleading outputs, posing
critical challenges for real-world applications. While many recent studies
focus on quantifying model uncertainty, relatively little work has been devoted
to \textit{diagnosing the source of uncertainty}. In this study, we show that,
when an LLM is uncertain, the patterns of disagreement among its multiple
generated responses contain rich clues about the underlying cause of
uncertainty. To illustrate this point, we collect multiple responses from a
target LLM and employ an auxiliary LLM to analyze their patterns of
disagreement. The auxiliary model is tasked to reason about the likely source
of uncertainty, such as whether it stems from ambiguity in the input question,
a lack of relevant knowledge, or both. In cases involving knowledge gaps, the
auxiliary model also identifies the specific missing facts or concepts
contributing to the uncertainty. In our experiment, we validate our framework
on AmbigQA, OpenBookQA, and MMLU-Pro, confirming its generality in diagnosing
distinct uncertainty sources. Such diagnosis shows the potential for relevant
manual interventions that improve LLM performance and reliability.

### [10] [Emotionally-Aware Agents for Dispute Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04465)
*Sushrita Rakshit,James Hale,Kushal Chawla,Jeanne M. Brett,Jonathan Gratch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究自动文本情感识别在争议解决中的作用，发现大语言模型比传统方法能更好地识别情感强度并解释情感表达如何影响冲突升级与解决。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在争议解决背景下，自动文本情感识别是否能提供对情感表达如何影响对方思想、情感和行动的洞察。争议比谈判引发更强烈的情感和不同的社会过程。

Method: 使用大型买家-卖家争议对话语料库，研究情感表达如何影响主观和客观结果。采用大语言模型进行情感强度标注，并与人类标注者的决策进行比较。

Result: 大语言模型比先前方法具有显著更大的解释力，能更好地匹配人类标注者的决策。研究结果支持现有关于情感表达如何促成冲突升级和解决的理论模型。

Conclusion: 基于代理的系统可以通过识别和潜在缓解情绪升级来有效管理争议，自动情感识别技术在争议解决中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: In conflict, people use emotional expressions to shape their counterparts'
thoughts, feelings, and actions. This paper explores whether automatic text
emotion recognition offers insight into this influence in the context of
dispute resolution. Prior work has shown the promise of such methods in
negotiations; however, disputes evoke stronger emotions and different social
processes. We use a large corpus of buyer-seller dispute dialogues to
investigate how emotional expressions shape subjective and objective outcomes.
We further demonstrate that large-language models yield considerably greater
explanatory power than previous methods for emotion intensity annotation and
better match the decisions of human annotators. Findings support existing
theoretical models for how emotional expressions contribute to conflict
escalation and resolution and suggest that agent-based systems could be useful
in managing disputes by recognizing and potentially mitigating emotional
escalation.

*Yuxuan Li,Declan Campbell,Stephanie C. Y. Chan,Andrew Kyle Lampinen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了语言模型中可迁移任务表征的形成时机和演化方式，发现这些表征以非单调、稀疏的方式在特定token位置形成，具有时间和语义双重局部性特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型在上下文学习过程中何时以及如何形成可迁移的任务表征，以理解模型动态适应新任务的计算机制。

Method: 通过分析语言模型中能够恢复任务上下文的可迁移向量表征，研究这些表征在上下文序列中的形成时机、演化模式以及与任务性能的关系。

Result: 发现可迁移任务表征以非单调、稀疏的方式在特定token位置形成，具有强烈的时间局部性；这些表征倾向于捕获最小"任务范围"，而更复杂的复合任务需要时间上分布更广的表征支持。

Conclusion: 语言模型通过具有时间和语义双重局部性的即时计算过程来动态适应新证据和学习新任务，这种机制支持了上下文学习能力。

Abstract: Many of language models' impressive capabilities originate from their
in-context learning: based on instructions or examples, they can infer and
perform new tasks without weight updates. In this work, we investigate
\emph{when} representations for new tasks are formed in language models, and
\emph{how} these representations change over the course of context. We focus on
''transferrable'' task representations -- vector representations that can
restore task context in another instance of the model, even without the full
prompt. We show that these representations evolve in non-monotonic and sporadic
ways, and are distinct from a more inert representation of high-level task
categories that persists throughout the context. Specifically, models often
condense multiple evidence into these transferrable task representations, which
align well with the performance improvement based on more examples in the
context. However, this accrual process exhibits strong locality along the
sequence dimension, coming online only at certain tokens -- despite task
identity being reliably decodable throughout the context. Moreover, these local
but transferrable task representations tend to capture minimal ''task scopes'',
such as a semantically-independent subtask, and models rely on more
temporally-distributed representations to support longer and composite tasks.
This two-fold locality (temporal and semantic) underscores a kind of
just-in-time computational process underlying language models' ability to adapt
to new evidence and learn new tasks on the fly.

*Hao Zhang,Mengsi Lyu,Yulong Ao,Yonghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 一种专门为预填解码分离推理设计的新型剪枝方法，通过迭代块移除和诊存剪枝机制，实现了20.56%的推理速度提升和4.95倍的数据传输带宽消耗降低


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型部署面临高计算和内存成本挑战，现有剪枝方法忽视了实际应用中预填解码分离的特性

Method: 构建剪枝和蓄粉集进行迭代块移除，对预填和解码阶段分别进行独立剪枝，并提出令牌感知诊存剪枝机制

Result: 方法在分离和统一设置下都表现优异，实现了20.56%推理速度提升和4.95倍数据传输带宽降低

Conclusion: 该方法为大语言模型的高效部署提供了一种精确而高效的剪枝方案，特别适用于预填解码分离场景

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities across
various tasks, but their deployment is constrained by high computational and
memory costs. Model pruning provides an effective means to alleviate these
demands. However, existing methods often ignore the characteristics of
prefill-decode (PD) disaggregation in practice. In this paper, we propose a
novel pruning method for PD disaggregation inference, enabling more precise and
efficient block and KV Cache pruning. Our approach constructs pruning and
distillation sets to perform iterative block removal independently for the
prefill and decode stages, obtaining better pruning solutions. Moreover, we
introduce a token-aware cache pruning mechanism that retains all KV Cache in
the prefill stage but selectively reuses entries for the first and last token
sequences in selected layers during decode, reducing communication costs with
minimal overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
consistently achieves strong performance in both PD disaggregation and PD
unified settings without disaggregation. Under the default settings, our method
achieves a 20.56% inference speedup and a 4.95 times reduction in data
transmission bandwidth consumption.

### [13] [Evaluating Large Language Models for Financial Reasoning: A CFA-Based Benchmark Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04468)
*Xuan Yao,Qianteng Wang,Xinbo Liu,Ke-Wei Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这是首个基于CFA正式模拟考试的大语言模型综合评估研究，测试了1,560道选择题，比较了不同设计优先级的模型在零检验和RAG提供下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在金融领域应用潜力巨大，但在专业金融情境中缺乏系统性评估。需要通过严格的专业认证考试来评估模型的实际金融分析能力。

Method: 使用1,560道CFA正式模拟考试题目（包括I-III级），比较多模态计算强大、推理专业高精度和轻量效率优化三类模型。采用零检验提示和新的RAG流水线（集成CFA课程内容）进行测试。

Result: 推理专业模型在零检验中表现最佳，RAG流水线特别在复杂场景中带来显著收益。错误分析显示知识缺口是主要失败原因，文本可读性影响最小。

Conclusion: 研究为金融领域LLM部署提供了可操作的见解，为实践者提供了基于证据的模型选择和成本性能优化指南。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models presents significant
opportunities for financial applications, yet systematic evaluation in
specialized financial contexts remains limited. This study presents the first
comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs using 1,560 multiple-choice
questions from official mock exams across Levels I-III of CFA, most rigorous
professional certifications globally that mirror real-world financial analysis
complexity. We compare models distinguished by core design priorities:
multi-modal and computationally powerful, reasoning-specialized and highly
accurate, and lightweight efficiency-optimized.
  We assess models under zero-shot prompting and through a novel
Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline that integrates official CFA curriculum
content. The RAG system achieves precise domain-specific knowledge retrieval
through hierarchical knowledge organization and structured query generation,
significantly enhancing reasoning accuracy in professional financial
certification evaluation.
  Results reveal that reasoning-oriented models consistently outperform others
in zero-shot settings, while the RAG pipeline provides substantial improvements
particularly for complex scenarios. Comprehensive error analysis identifies
knowledge gaps as the primary failure mode, with minimal impact from text
readability. These findings provide actionable insights for LLM deployment in
finance, offering practitioners evidence-based guidance for model selection and
cost-performance optimization.

processing strategies: direct image processing using multi-modal capabilities
and a structured parsing approach converting documents to markdown first.
Results show native image processing generally outperforms structured
approaches, with performance varying across model types and document
characteristics. This benchmark provides insights for selecting appropriate
models and processing strategies for automated document systems. Our code is

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在复杂指令执行、减少幻觉和空间推理任务中的局限性，提升模型在实际协作任务中的表现

Method: 集成中等规模LLM代理，采用新颖抽象机制和话语模块来解析指令，学习环境的高层次动态表示

Result: 在自然协作构建任务中优于单LLM CoT和代理式LLM系统，能够避免幻觉、识别缺失信息、请求澄清并更新学习对象，在ToolBench API完成任务中也表现出色

Conclusion: COCORELI框架通过混合代理方法和抽象机制，有效提升了LLM在复杂任务中的表现，其抽象能力具有广泛的应用潜力

Abstract: We present COCORELI, a hybrid agent framework designed to tackle the
limitations of large language models (LLMs) in tasks requiring: following
complex instructions, minimizing hallucination, and spatial reasoning. COCORELI
integrates medium-sized LLM agents with novel abstraction mechanisms and a
discourse module to parse instructions to in-context learn dynamic, high-level
representations of the environment. Experiments on natural collaborative
construction tasks show that COCORELI outperforms single-LLM CoT and agentic
LLM systems, all using larger LLMs. It manages to largely avoid hallucinations,
identify missing information, ask for clarifications, and update its learned
objects. COCORELI's abstraction abilities extend beyond ENVIRONMENT, as shown
in the ToolBench API completion task.

*Alice Schiavone,Marco Fraccaro,Lea Marie Pehrson,Silvia Ingala,Rasmus Bonnevie,Michael Bachmann Nielsen,Vincent Beliveau,Melanie Ganz,Desmond Elliott*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MOSAIC是一个多语言、分类法无关的放射学报告分类系统，基于开源模型MedGemma-4B，支持零样本/少样本提示和轻量微调，在多个语言和数据集上达到接近专家水平的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有放射学报告分类方法存在局限性：基于规则的方法难以处理语言变异性，监督模型需要大量标注数据，基于LLM的系统依赖闭源或资源密集型模型，且主要局限于英语和单一模态数据集。

Method: 基于紧凑的开源语言模型MedGemma-4B，支持零样本/少样本提示和轻量微调，可在消费级GPU上部署，支持多语言、多模态和多分类法。

Result: 在7个数据集（英语、西班牙语、法语、丹麦语）上评估，平均宏观F1分数达88%，接近或超过专家水平，仅需24GB GPU内存。数据增强后，仅80个标注样本即可在丹麦语报告上达到82%的加权F1分数。

Conclusion: MOSAIC为临床环境提供了大型或专有LLM的实用替代方案，代码和模型开源，邀请社区评估和扩展到新语言、分类法和模态。

Abstract: Radiology reports contain rich clinical information that can be used to train
imaging models without relying on costly manual annotation. However, existing
approaches face critical limitations: rule-based methods struggle with
linguistic variability, supervised models require large annotated datasets, and
recent LLM-based systems depend on closed-source or resource-intensive models
that are unsuitable for clinical use. Moreover, current solutions are largely
restricted to English and single-modality, single-taxonomy datasets. We
introduce MOSAIC, a multilingual, taxonomy-agnostic, and computationally
efficient approach for radiological report classification. Built on a compact
open-access language model (MedGemma-4B), MOSAIC supports both zero-/few-shot
prompting and lightweight fine-tuning, enabling deployment on consumer-grade
GPUs. We evaluate MOSAIC across seven datasets in English, Spanish, French, and
Danish, spanning multiple imaging modalities and label taxonomies. The model
achieves a mean macro F1 score of 88 across five chest X-ray datasets,
approaching or exceeding expert-level performance, while requiring only 24 GB
of GPU memory. With data augmentation, as few as 80 annotated samples are
sufficient to reach a weighted F1 score of 82 on Danish reports, compared to 86
with the full 1600-sample training set. MOSAIC offers a practical alternative
to large or proprietary LLMs in clinical settings. Code and models are
open-source. We invite the community to evaluate and extend MOSAIC on new
languages, taxonomies, and modalities.

*Kushan Mitra,Dan Zhang,Hannah Kim,Estevam Hruschka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RECAP是一个新的基准测试，用于评估和改进意图重写技术，通过将用户-代理对话重构为简洁的用户目标表示来解决对话中的歧义和模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界对话往往存在歧义、不完整或动态变化的特点，传统分类方法在开放场景中泛化能力差，导致意图检测困难和下游规划效果不佳。

Method: 提出RECAP基准测试数据集和基于LLM的评估器，开发基于提示的重写方法，并微调两个基于DPO的重写模型。

Result: 基于提示的重写方法优于基线，微调DPO重写模型带来额外效用提升，证明意图重写是改进开放域对话系统代理规划的关键可行组件。

Conclusion: 意图重写是提升对话系统代理规划能力的重要技术，RECAP基准为这一领域的研究提供了有效的评估框架。

Abstract: Understanding user intent is essential for effective planning in
conversational assistants, particularly those powered by large language models
(LLMs) coordinating multiple agents. However, real-world dialogues are often
ambiguous, underspecified, or dynamic, making intent detection a persistent
challenge. Traditional classification-based approaches struggle to generalize
in open-ended settings, leading to brittle interpretations and poor downstream
planning. We propose RECAP (REwriting Conversations for Agent Planning), a new
benchmark designed to evaluate and advance intent rewriting, reframing
user-agent dialogues into concise representations of user goals. RECAP captures
diverse challenges such as ambiguity, intent drift, vagueness, and mixed-goal
conversations. Alongside the dataset, we introduce an LLM-based evaluator that
assesses planning utility given the rewritten intent. Using RECAP, we develop a
prompt-based rewriting approach that outperforms baselines. We further
demonstrate that fine-tuning two DPO-based rewriters yields additional utility
gains. Our results highlight intent rewriting as a critical and tractable
component for improving agent planning in open-domain dialogue systems.

Motivation: 语音编码器与LLM集成需要大量数据和资源，但实际应用中数据可用性不足，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用参数高效的适配器转换语音嵌入，采用LLM合成数据集标注技术减少标注成本，并引入分类器正则化和LoRA优化技术。

Result: 在LibriSpeech ASR任务上相对WER提升26%，NER任务F1分数提升6.3%，SA任务F1分数提升32%，SLUE评分提升6.6%-9.5%。

Conclusion: 所提出的适配器方法使用7倍更少的可训练参数，在多个语音处理任务上实现了显著的性能提升，为语音-LLM集成提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: While integrating speech encoder with LLM requires substantial data and
resources, use cases face limitations due to insufficient availability. To
address this, we propose a solution with a parameter-efficient adapter that
converts speech embeddings into LLM-compatible tokens, focusing on end-to-end
automatic speech recognition (ASR), named entity recognition (NER), and
sentiment analysis (SA). To reduce labeling costs, we employ an LLM-based
synthetic dataset annotation technique. The proposed adapter, using 7x fewer
trainable parameters, achieves significant performance gains: a 26% relative
Word Error Rates (WER) improvement on the LibriSpeech ASR task, a 6.3% relative
F1 score increase on the NER task, and a 32% relative F1 score boost on the SA
task. Moreover, using advanced techniques such as adding a classifier
regularizer and optimizing the LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) yields
notable performance gains, with Spoken Language Understanding Evaluation (SLUE)
score improvement of 6.6% and 9.5%

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个用于评估推测解码方法加速LLM测试时扩展的基准测试，发现n-gram方法能有效捕获重复模式，建议将其与模型或训练方法结合以平衡加速效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时扩展虽然能增强大语言模型的推理能力，但会产生冗余和重复的推理轨迹，导致计算开销巨大。推测解码有望缓解这种低效问题，但其在测试时扩展环境中的效果尚未充分探索。

Method: 建立了包含代表性测试时扩展范式（如Best-of-N采样和多轮思考）的统一基准测试，评估了三类推测解码方法：基于模型、基于训练和基于n-gram的方法。

Result: 实验表明简单的n-gram方法能有效捕获重复模式，在加速测试时扩展方面展现出独特潜力。n-gram方法与模型或训练方法结合可以平衡重复和多样化推理的加速效果。

Conclusion: 该基准测试为推测解码在测试时扩展中的应用提供了研究基础，通过更好地处理重复和多样化推理路径，有望实现更快速实用的LLM推理。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by allocating additional
computational resources during inference. However, this paradigm is inherently
inefficient due to the generation of redundant and repetitive reasoning traces,
leading to significant computational overhead. Speculative decoding offers a
promising avenue for mitigating this inefficiency, yet its efficacy in the
structured, repetition-rich context of test-time scaling remains largely
unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark
designed to evaluate speculative decoding methods for accelerating LLM
test-time scaling. Our benchmark provides consistent experimental protocols
across representative test-time scaling paradigms (e.g., Best-of-N sampling and
multi-round thinking), enabling a fair comparison of three major categories of
speculative decoding: model-based, training-based, and n-gram-based methods.
Extensive experiments reveal that simple n-gram-based methods effectively
capture repetitive patterns, demonstrating unique potential in accelerating
test-time scaling. This phenomenon demonstrates the value of integrating
n-gram-based methods with model-based or training-based approaches to balance
acceleration for both repetitive and diverse reasoning in test-time scaling. We
hope this benchmark spurs further research on speculative decoding for
test-time scaling, enabling faster and more practical reasoning in LLMs through
better handling of repetitive and diverse reasoning paths.

TL;DR: 通过并行生成多种思考路径来克服大语言模型的"穿透视觉"问题，ParaThinker框架在保持低延迟的同时显著提升推理准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时计算扩展策略存在效果瓶颈，模型的不完美初始步骤导致被锁定在次优推理路径中，这称为"穿透视觉"现象

Method: 提出ParaThinker框架，训练LLM并行生成多种多样化的推理路径，然后综合这些路径产生更优的最终答案，实现原生思考并行性

Result: 在挑战性推理测试集上，平均提升12.3%(1.5B模型)和7.5%(7B模型)的准确率，仅增加7.1%的延迟，让小模型超越更大模型

Conclusion: 并行计算扩展(宽度)比简单的序列扩展(深度)更有效和高效，并行思考是未来LLM扩展的关键高效维度

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have been driven by test-time
compute scaling - a strategy that improves reasoning by generating longer,
sequential thought processes. While effective, this approach encounters a
significant bottleneck as computation increases, where further computation
offers only marginal performance gains. We argue this ceiling is not an
inherent limit of the model's capability but a flaw in the scaling strategy
itself, a phenomenon we term "Tunnel Vision", where a model's imperfect initial
steps lock it into a suboptimal reasoning path. To overcome this, we introduce
a new scaling paradigm: native thought parallelism. We present ParaThinker, an
end-to-end framework that trains an LLM to generate multiple, diverse reasoning
paths in parallel and synthesize them into a superior final answer. By
exploring different lines of thoughts simultaneously, ParaThinker effectively
sidesteps the Tunnel Vision issue and unlocks the model's latent reasoning
potential. Our approach demonstrates that scaling compute in parallel (width)
is a more effective and efficient way to superior reasoning than simply scaling
sequentially (depth). On challenging reasoning benchmarks, ParaThinker achieves
substantial accuracy improvements over sequential LLMs (12.3% for 1.5B and 7.5%
for 7B models on average with 8 parallel paths), while adding only negligible
latency overhead (7.1%). This enables smaller models to surpass much larger
counterparts and establishes parallel thinking as a critical, efficient
dimension for scaling future LLMs.

Motivation: 现有的文本到分子模型使用原子级标记化，主要关注局部连接性，限制了模型捕捉分子全局结构上下文的能力。子结构级上下文（如环系统）对于理解分子结构具有重要意义。

Method: 提出子结构级标记化方案，并开发基于重要性的训练策略，优先处理关键子结构。还提出了简单有效的集成策略来聚合多个模型的输出。

Result: CAMT5在各种文本到分子生成任务中表现出优越性，仅使用2%的训练标记就能超越最先进方法。集成策略进一步提升了生成性能。

Conclusion: 子结构级标记化和重要性训练策略能有效提升文本到分子模型的性能，CAMT5在效率和效果方面都表现出色，为分子生成任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, text-to-molecule models have shown great potential across various
chemical applications, e.g., drug-discovery. These models adapt language models
to molecular data by representing molecules as sequences of atoms. However,
they rely on atom-level tokenizations, which primarily focus on modeling local
connectivity, thereby limiting the ability of models to capture the global
structural context within molecules. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel
text-to-molecule model, coined Context-Aware Molecular T5 (CAMT5). Inspired by
the significance of the substructure-level contexts in understanding molecule
structures, e.g., ring systems, we introduce substructure-level tokenization
for text-to-molecule models. Building on our tokenization scheme, we develop an
importance-based training strategy that prioritizes key substructures, enabling
CAMT5 to better capture the molecular semantics. Extensive experiments verify
the superiority of CAMT5 in various text-to-molecule generation tasks.
Intriguingly, we find that CAMT5 outperforms the state-of-the-art methods using
only 2% of training tokens. In addition, we propose a simple yet effective
ensemble strategy that aggregates the outputs of text-to-molecule models to
further boost the generation performance. Code is available at

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end mobile system that delivers
culturally-attuned safe driving feedback to drivers in Nigeria, a low-resource
environment with significant infrastructural challenges. The core of the system
is a novel dual-component Natural Language Generation (NLG) engine that
provides both legally-grounded safety tips and persuasive, theory-driven
behavioural reports. We describe the complete system architecture, including an
automatic trip detection service, on-device behaviour analysis, and a
sophisticated NLG pipeline that leverages a two-step reflection process to
ensure high-quality feedback. The system also integrates a specialized machine
learning model for detecting alcohol-influenced driving, a key local safety
issue. The architecture is engineered for robustness against intermittent
connectivity and noisy sensor data. A pilot deployment with 90 drivers
demonstrates the viability of our approach, and initial results on detected
unsafe behaviours are presented. This work provides a framework for applying
data-to-text and AI systems to achieve social good.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型通过分布式训练驱动的分化而非模块化架构来实现稀有词元处理，形成双计算机制，稀有词元需要额外的plateau神经元，这些神经元空间分布而非模块化集群，注意力机制没有偏好性路由。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在稀有词元预测方面存在困难，先前研究发现稀有词元存在专门的plateau神经元，但其功能组织机制尚不清楚，需要深入研究。

Method: 在GPT-2 XL和Pythia模型中进行神经元影响分析、基于图的聚类和注意力头消融实验。

Result: 1) 稀有词元处理需要额外的plateau神经元，形成双计算机制；2) plateau神经元空间分布而非模块化集群；3) 注意力机制没有对专家神经元的偏好性路由。

Conclusion: 稀有词元专门化通过分布式训练驱动的分化实现，而非架构模块化，在保持上下文敏感灵活性的同时实现了自适应容量分配。

Abstract: Large language models struggle with rare token prediction, yet the mechanisms
driving their specialization remain unclear. Prior work identified specialized
``plateau'' neurons for rare tokens following distinctive three-regime
influence patterns \cite{liu2025emergent}, but their functional organization is
unknown. We investigate this through neuron influence analyses, graph-based
clustering, and attention head ablations in GPT-2 XL and Pythia models. Our
findings show that: (1) rare token processing requires additional plateau
neurons beyond the power-law regime sufficient for common tokens, forming dual
computational regimes; (2) plateau neurons are spatially distributed rather
than forming modular clusters; and (3) attention mechanisms exhibit no
preferential routing to specialists. These results demonstrate that rare token
specialization arises through distributed, training-driven differentiation
rather than architectural modularity, preserving context-sensitive flexibility
while achieving adaptive capacity allocation.

Abstract: Visual Emotion Recognition (VER) is an important research topic due to its
wide range of applications, including opinion mining and advertisement design.
Extending this capability to recognize emotions at the individual level further
broadens its potential applications. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) have attracted increasing attention and demonstrated performance
comparable to that of conventional VER methods. However, MLLMs are trained on
large and diverse datasets containing general opinions, which causes them to
favor majority viewpoints and familiar patterns. This tendency limits their
performance in a personalized VER, which is crucial for practical and
real-world applications, and indicates a key area for improvement. To address
this limitation, the proposed method employs discrete prompt tuning inspired by
the process of humans' prompt engineering to adapt the VER task to each
individual. Our method selects the best natural language representation from
the generated prompts and uses it to update the prompt for the realization of
accurate personalized VER.

Method: 使用能量基模型(EBM)在260万题目的指南语义语料库上学习平滑的能量场景，与调校softmax基线和kNN密度偏向方法进行对比

Result: EBM在语义难题上实现最佳避免性能(AUROC 0.961 vs 0.950)，降低假阻性率(FPR@95 0.235 vs 0.331)，在安全关键难分布中优势明显

Conclusion: 能量基避免评分比概率基的softmax信任更可靠，为安全RAG系统提供了可扩展和可解释的基础

Abstract: Reliable abstention is critical for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
systems, particularly in safety-critical domains such as women's health, where
incorrect answers can lead to harm. We present an energy-based model (EBM) that
learns a smooth energy landscape over a dense semantic corpus of 2.6M
guideline-derived questions, enabling the system to decide when to generate or
abstain. We benchmark the EBM against a calibrated softmax baseline and a
k-nearest neighbour (kNN) density heuristic across both easy and hard
abstention splits, where hard cases are semantically challenging
near-distribution queries. The EBM achieves superior abstention performance
abstention on semantically hard cases, reaching AUROC 0.961 versus 0.950 for
softmax, while also reducing FPR@95 (0.235 vs 0.331). On easy negatives,
performance is comparable across methods, but the EBM's advantage becomes most
pronounced in safety-critical hard distributions. A comprehensive ablation with
controlled negative sampling and fair data exposure shows that robustness stems
primarily from the energy scoring head, while the inclusion or exclusion of
specific negative types (hard, easy, mixed) sharpens decision boundaries but is
not essential for generalisation to hard cases. These results demonstrate that
energy-based abstention scoring offers a more reliable confidence signal than
probability-based softmax confidence, providing a scalable and interpretable
foundation for safe RAG systems.

Result: 通过自动评估为声明分解建立了基准，提高了事实核查系统的可靠性和有效性

Conclusion: DecMetrics框架能够有效评估声明分解质量，为事实核查系统提供了更好的可靠性保障

Abstract: Claim decomposition plays a crucial role in the fact-checking process by
breaking down complex claims into simpler atomic components and identifying
their unfactual elements. Despite its importance, current research primarily
focuses on generative methods for decomposition, with insufficient emphasis on
evaluating the quality of these decomposed atomic claims. To bridge this gap,
we introduce \textbf{DecMetrics}, which comprises three new metrics:
\texttt{COMPLETENESS}, \texttt{CORRECTNESS}, and \texttt{SEMANTIC ENTROPY},
designed to automatically assess the quality of claims produced by
decomposition models. Utilizing these metrics, we develop a lightweight claim
decomposition model, optimizing its performance through the integration of
these metrics as a reward function. Through automatic evaluation, our approach
aims to set a benchmark for claim decomposition, enhancing both the reliability
and effectiveness of fact-checking systems.

Abstract: Providing constructive feedback to paper authors is a core component of peer
review. With reviewers increasingly having less time to perform reviews,
automated support systems are required to ensure high reviewing quality, thus
making the feedback in reviews useful for authors. To this end, we identify
four key aspects of review comments (individual points in weakness sections of
reviews) that drive the utility for authors: Actionability, Grounding &
Specificity, Verifiability, and Helpfulness. To enable evaluation and
development of models assessing review comments, we introduce the RevUtil
dataset. We collect 1,430 human-labeled review comments and scale our data with
10k synthetically labeled comments for training purposes. The synthetic data
additionally contains rationales, i.e., explanations for the aspect score of a
review comment. Employing the RevUtil dataset, we benchmark fine-tuned models
for assessing review comments on these aspects and generating rationales. Our
experiments demonstrate that these fine-tuned models achieve agreement levels
with humans comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, those of powerful
closed models like GPT-4o. Our analysis further reveals that machine-generated
reviews generally underperform human reviews on our four aspects.

Abstract: We present ASCENDgpt, a transformer-based model specifically designed for
cardiovascular risk prediction from longitudinal electronic health records
(EHRs). Our approach introduces a novel phenotype-aware tokenization scheme
that maps 47,155 raw ICD codes to 176 clinically meaningful phenotype tokens,
achieving 99.6\% consolidation of diagnosis codes while preserving semantic

tokens - a 77.9\% reduction when compared with using raw ICD codes directly. We
pretrain ASCENDgpt on sequences derived from 19402 unique individuals using a
masked language modeling objective, then fine-tune for time-to-event prediction
of five cardiovascular outcomes: myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, major
adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), cardiovascular death, and all-cause
mortality. Our model achieves excellent discrimination on the held-out test set
with an average C-index of 0.816, demonstrating strong performance across all
outcomes (MI: 0.792, stroke: 0.824, MACE: 0.800, cardiovascular death: 0.842,
all-cause mortality: 0.824). The phenotype-based approach enables clinically
interpretable predictions while maintaining computational efficiency. Our work
demonstrates the effectiveness of domain-specific tokenization and pretraining
for EHR-based risk prediction tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于串行化输出提示(SOP)的方法来改善大语言模型在多讲话人语音识别中的性能，通过结构化提示明确指导LLM并在两讲话人和三讲话人场景下都取得了显著改善。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM基于多讲话人ASR系统要么省略提示要么依赖简单的任务定义提示，没有工作深入探索如何设计提示来提升系统性能。提示对于任务定义和改善LLM基系统的性能至关重要。

Method: 提出SOP-MT-ASR方法：1)在语音编码器后插入分离器和串行化CTC层，按先说先出的方式分离和提取混合语音编码中的多讲话人内容；2)通过贪婪搜索解码串行化CTC输出获得SOP作为LLM的提示；3)设计三阶段训练策略：串行化输出训练细调、串行化语音信息提取、SOP基于适配。

Result: 在LibriMix数据集上的实验结果显示：LLM基于的SOT模型在两讲话人场景下表现良好，但在更复杂的三讲话人场景下无法充分利用LLM。提出的SOP方法在两种条件下都显著提高了性能。

Conclusion: 通过提出串行化输出提示(SOP)方法，能够有效地指导大语言模型在多讲话人语音识别任务中的表现，尤其是在复杂的多讲话人场景下显著改善了系统性能。

Abstract: Prompts are crucial for task definition and for improving the performance of
large language models (LLM)-based systems. However, existing LLM-based
multi-talker (MT) automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems either omit
prompts or rely on simple task-definition prompts, with no prior work exploring
the design of prompts to enhance performance. In this paper, we propose
extracting serialized output prompts (SOP) and explicitly guiding the LLM using
structured prompts to improve system performance (SOP-MT-ASR). A Separator and
serialized Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) layers are inserted
after the speech encoder to separate and extract MT content from the mixed
speech encoding in a first-speaking-first-out manner. Subsequently, the SOP,
which serves as a prompt for LLMs, is obtained by decoding the serialized CTC
outputs using greedy search. To train the model effectively, we design a
three-stage training strategy, consisting of serialized output training (SOT)
fine-tuning, serialized speech information extraction, and SOP-based
adaptation. Experimental results on the LibriMix dataset show that, although
the LLM-based SOT model performs well in the two-talker scenario, it fails to
fully leverage LLMs under more complex conditions, such as the three-talker
scenario. The proposed SOP approach significantly improved performance under
both two- and three-talker conditions.

*Xinnian Zhao,Hugo Van Hamme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用电视字幕作为上下文提示的弱监督ASR方法，通过迭代优化生成伪转录本，显著提高了转录准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电视字幕虽然容易获取，但与音频的对齐不精确，不能直接作为监督目标。需要一种方法能够处理口语音频和字幕文本之间的差异

Method: 将字幕重新构想为上下文丰富的提示，而不是直接监督信号。使用加权注意力机制在推理过程中强调相关字幕标记，通过迭代优化生成伪转录本

Result: 实验证明该方法在转录准确性方面有显著改进，生成的伪标签数据集为训练鲁棒ASR系统提供了高质量基础资源

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用了电视字幕的上下文信息，通过提示引导的迭代优化过程成功提升了ASR系统的转录性能

Abstract: This study proposes a novel approach to using TV subtitles within a weakly
supervised (WS) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) framework. Although TV
subtitles are readily available, their imprecise alignment with corresponding
audio limits their applicability as supervised targets for verbatim
transcription. Rather than using subtitles as direct supervision signals, our
method reimagines them as context-rich prompts. This design enables the model
to handle discrepancies between spoken audio and subtitle text. Instead,
generated pseudo transcripts become the primary targets, with subtitles acting
as guiding cues for iterative refinement. To further enhance the process, we
introduce a weighted attention mechanism that emphasizes relevant subtitle
tokens during inference. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements
in transcription accuracy, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed
method in refining transcripts. These enhanced pseudo-labeled datasets provide
high-quality foundational resources for training robust ASR systems.

*Charles Moslonka,Hicham Randrianarivo,Arthur Garnier,Emmanuel Malherbe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于单次生成序列中可用top token对数概率的幻觉检测方法，适用于数据访问受限的黑盒LLM API场景，显著提升了问答任务中的幻觉检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在问答任务中的幻觉输出严重影响了其实际应用的可靠性，特别是在只能获取有限数据（如黑盒API仅暴露少量top token对数概率）的场景下，需要一种高效的幻觉检测方法。

Method: 从非贪婪解码过程中可用的top token对数概率推导不确定性指标，首先提出熵产生率(EPR)基准指标，然后通过监督学习增强，使用单次生成序列中可访问top token的熵贡献特征，无需多次查询重运行。

Result: 在多样化问答数据集和多个LLM上的评估表明，该方法相比单独使用EPR显著改善了幻觉检测性能，仅使用典型的小规模可用对数概率集（如每个token的top<10）就能实现高性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为QA和RAG系统提供了一种即插即用的技术，通过单次生成过程即可增强LLM响应的可信度，在金融框架分析年度报告查询响应的实际应用中证明了其实用性。

Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Language Model (LLM) outputs for Question Answering
(QA) tasks critically undermine their real-world reliability. This paper
introduces an applied methodology for robust, one-shot hallucination detection,
specifically designed for scenarios with limited data access, such as
interacting with black-box LLM APIs that typically expose only a few top
candidate log-probabilities per token. Our approach derives uncertainty
indicators directly from these readily available log-probabilities generated
during non-greedy decoding. We first derive an Entropy Production Rate (EPR)
metric that offers baseline performance, later augmented with supervised
learning. Our learned model uses features representing the entropic
contributions of the accessible top-ranked tokens within a single generated
sequence, requiring no multiple query re-runs. Evaluated across diverse QA
datasets and multiple LLMs, this estimator significantly improves hallucination
detection over using EPR alone. Crucially, high performance is demonstrated
using only the typically small set of available log-probabilities (e.g., top
<10 per token), confirming its practical efficiency and suitability for these
API-constrained deployments. This work provides a readily deployable technique
to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM responses from a single generation pass
in QA and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, with its utility
further demonstrated in a finance framework analyzing responses to queries on
annual reports from an industrial dataset.

TL;DR: 通过分析ICU出院摘要中的临床笔记，使用混合流水线进行医务人员熬熬监测，精度达0.80，F1指数0.84，显著超越传统基线方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床医生熬熬对ICU患者安全构成重大威胁，现有研究主要依靠回顾性问卷或广泛的EHR元数据，忽视了临床笔记中的叙述信息价值

Method: 分析MIMIC-IV数据库中10,000份ICU出院摘要，采用混合流求线组合BioBERT情感嵌入、词法压力词典和LDA主题模型，使用逻辑回归分类器进行医务人员熬熬监测

Result: 在分层拆分集上达到精度0.80、召回率0.89、F1指数0.84，超过元数据基线方法0.17以上。强化专业分析显示放射科、精神病学和神经科医生的熬熬风险更高

Conclusion: ICU临床笔记含有可执行的信号，可用于主动的医务人员健康监测，为预防性健康管理提供了新的视角和工具

Abstract: Clinician burnout poses a substantial threat to patient safety, particularly
in high-acuity intensive care units (ICUs). Existing research predominantly
relies on retrospective survey tools or broad electronic health record (EHR)
metadata, often overlooking the valuable narrative information embedded in
clinical notes. In this study, we analyze 10,000 ICU discharge summaries from
MIMIC-IV, a publicly available database derived from the electronic health
records of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The dataset encompasses
diverse patient data, including vital signs, medical orders, diagnoses,
procedures, treatments, and deidentified free-text clinical notes. We introduce
a hybrid pipeline that combines BioBERT sentiment embeddings fine-tuned for
clinical narratives, a lexical stress lexicon tailored for clinician burnout
surveillance, and five-topic latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) with workload
proxies. A provider-level logistic regression classifier achieves a precision
of 0.80, a recall of 0.89, and an F1 score of 0.84 on a stratified hold-out
set, surpassing metadata-only baselines by greater than or equal to 0.17 F1
score. Specialty-specific analysis indicates elevated burnout risk among
providers in Radiology, Psychiatry, and Neurology. Our findings demonstrate
that ICU clinical narratives contain actionable signals for proactive
well-being monitoring.

TL;DR: 研究发现开源大语言模型在大学推荐中存在地理、人口和经济偏见，全球北方院校被过度推荐，存在性别刻板印象和机构重复问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs越来越多地用于教育规划等日常推荐任务，其推荐结果可能延续社会偏见，需要实证研究这些偏见的具体表现。

Method: 使用360个模拟用户档案（基于性别、国籍和经济状况变化），分析三个开源LLM（LLaMA-3.1-8B、Gemma-7B、Mistral-7B）的25,000多条大学和专业推荐，提出多维度评估框架。

Result: 结果显示强烈偏见：全球北方院校被过度偏爱，推荐经常强化性别刻板印象，机构重复现象普遍。LLaMA-3.1多样性最高但系统性差异仍然存在。

Conclusion: 研究强调在教育LLMs中考虑偏见的紧迫性，需要确保全球高等教育机会的公平性，提出了超越准确度的多维度评估方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as daily recommendation
systems for tasks like education planning, yet their recommendations risk
perpetuating societal biases. This paper empirically examines geographic,
demographic, and economic biases in university and program suggestions from
three open-source LLMs: LLaMA-3.1-8B, Gemma-7B, and Mistral-7B. Using 360
simulated user profiles varying by gender, nationality, and economic status, we
analyze over 25,000 recommendations. Results show strong biases: institutions
in the Global North are disproportionately favored, recommendations often
reinforce gender stereotypes, and institutional repetition is prevalent. While
LLaMA-3.1 achieves the highest diversity, recommending 481 unique universities
across 58 countries, systemic disparities persist. To quantify these issues, we
propose a novel, multi-dimensional evaluation framework that goes beyond
accuracy by measuring demographic and geographic representation. Our findings
highlight the urgent need for bias consideration in educational LMs to ensure
equitable global access to higher education.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成式搜索引擎和深度研究LLM代理在可信度、来源基础和引用实践方面存在过度自信、弱来源支持和混乱引用等问题，需要系统化的评估框架。

Method: 开发DeepTRACE框架，包含8个可测量维度，使用语句级分析（分解、置信度评分）和构建引用与事实支持矩阵，通过自动化提取流程和LLM-judge评估多个主流模型。

Result: 生成式搜索引擎和深度研究代理在辩论查询中经常产生片面且高度自信的回答，大量陈述缺乏来源支持。深度研究配置能减少过度自信但仍有片面性，引用准确率在40-80%之间。

Conclusion: 当前生成式搜索和深度研究系统在证据推理和归因方面存在显著缺陷，需要改进引用实践和事实支持机制，DeepTRACE框架为系统评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Generative search engines and deep research LLM agents promise trustworthy,
source-grounded synthesis, yet users regularly encounter overconfidence, weak
sourcing, and confusing citation practices. We introduce DeepTRACE, a novel
sociotechnically grounded audit framework that turns prior community-identified
failure cases into eight measurable dimensions spanning answer text, sources,
and citations. DeepTRACE uses statement-level analysis (decomposition,
confidence scoring) and builds citation and factual-support matrices to audit
how systems reason with and attribute evidence end-to-end. Using automated
extraction pipelines for popular public models (e.g., GPT-4.5/5, You.com,
Perplexity, Copilot/Bing, Gemini) and an LLM-judge with validated agreement to
human raters, we evaluate both web-search engines and deep-research
configurations. Our findings show that generative search engines and deep
research agents frequently produce one-sided, highly confident responses on
debate queries and include large fractions of statements unsupported by their
own listed sources. Deep-research configurations reduce overconfidence and can
attain high citation thoroughness, but they remain highly one-sided on debate
queries and still exhibit large fractions of unsupported statements, with
citation accuracy ranging from 40--80% across systems.

TL;DR: LLMs在处理混合上下文时倾向于采纳较少出现的信息，即使是不相关内容，这带来可靠性风险。研究提出基于Rescorla-Wagner模型的RW-Steering方法，通过两阶段微调让模型学会识别和忽略不适当信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界上下文往往混合相关和不相关内容，LLMs如何处理和优先排序这种混合上下文存在可靠性风险，需要研究其行为模式并开发解决方案。

Method: 引入Poisoned Context测试平台，将Rescorla-Wagner模型从神经科学适配到LLM上下文处理分析，并提出RW-Steering两阶段微调方法。

Result: LLMs表现出强烈倾向采纳上下文中较少出现的信息，即使是不相关内容。RW-Steering方法在实验中使响应质量提升39.8%，并能逆转不良行为曲线。

Conclusion: RW-Steering是一种鲁棒、可泛化的上下文工程解决方案，能够有效提高LLM在现实世界使用中的安全性。

Abstract: Incorporating external context can significantly enhance the response quality
of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, real-world contexts often mix
relevant information with disproportionate inappropriate content, posing
reliability risks. How do LLMs process and prioritize mixed context? To study
this, we introduce the Poisoned Context Testbed, pairing queries with
real-world contexts containing relevant and inappropriate content. Inspired by
associative learning in animals, we adapt the Rescorla-Wagner (RW) model from
neuroscience to quantify how competing contextual signals influence LLM
outputs. Our adapted model reveals a consistent behavioral pattern: LLMs
exhibit a strong tendency to incorporate information that is less prevalent in
the context. This susceptibility is harmful in real-world settings, where small
amounts of inappropriate content can substantially degrade response quality.
Empirical evaluations on our testbed further confirm this vulnerability. To
tackle this, we introduce RW-Steering, a two-stage finetuning-based approach
that enables the model to internally identify and ignore inappropriate signals.
Unlike prior methods that rely on extensive supervision across diverse context
mixtures, RW-Steering generalizes robustly across varying proportions of
inappropriate content. Experiments show that our best fine-tuned model improves
response quality by 39.8% and reverses the undesirable behavior curve,
establishing RW-Steering as a robust, generalizable context engineering
solution for improving LLM safety in real-world use.

Conclusion: 论文不仅完整地总结了现有指令微调算法，还提出了新的研究方向GRAPE，为该领域提供了完整的学习资源和研究启示。

Abstract: This paper provides a self-contained, from-scratch, exposition of key
algorithms for instruction tuning of models: SFT, Rejection Sampling,
REINFORCE, Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO), Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO). Explanations of these algorithms often assume
prior knowledge, lack critical details, and/or are overly generalized and
complex. Here, each method is discussed and developed step by step using
simplified and explicit notation focused on LLMs, aiming to eliminate ambiguity
and provide a clear and intuitive understanding of the concepts. By minimizing
detours into the broader RL literature and connecting concepts to LLMs, we
eliminate superfluous abstractions and reduce cognitive overhead. Following
this exposition, we provide a literature review of new techniques and
approaches beyond those detailed. Finally, new ideas for research and
exploration in the form of GRAPE (Generalized Relative Advantage Policy
Evolution) are presented.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG系统在检索阶段经常返回不相关或误导性样本，严重影响了LLMs的生成性能，需要一种系统性的方法来评估和提升模型对检索样本的判别能力。

Method: 1) 构建VaccineRAG数据集，包含不同正负样本比例的基准测试；2) 要求LLMs为每个样本生成显式的思维链分析；3) 提出Partial-GRPO方法，将LLM输出建模为多个组件而非单一整体，以更好地学习复杂思维链内容。

Result: 在VaccineRAG上的综合评估和消融研究验证了所提方案的有效性，证明该方法能够显著提升模型对检索样本的判别能力和复杂思维链的学习能力。

Conclusion: VaccineRAG为解决RAG系统中检索精度问题提供了有效的解决方案，通过思维链分析和Partial-GRPO方法，系统性地提升了LLMs在检索增强生成任务中的性能表现。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances the response accuracy of Large
Language Models (LLMs) by integrating retrieval and generation modules with
external knowledge, demonstrating particular strength in real-time queries and
Visual Question Answering tasks. However, the effectiveness of RAG is
frequently hindered by the precision of the retriever: many retrieved samples
fed into the generation phase are irrelevant or misleading, posing a critical
bottleneck to LLMs' performance. To address this challenge, we introduce
VaccineRAG, a novel Chain-of-Thought-based retrieval-augmented generation
dataset. On one hand, VaccineRAG employs a benchmark to evaluate models using
data with varying positive/negative sample ratios, systematically exposing
inherent weaknesses in current LLMs. On the other hand, it enhances models'
sample-discrimination capabilities by prompting LLMs to generate explicit
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) analysis for each sample before producing final answers.
Furthermore, to enhance the model's ability to learn long-sequence complex CoT
content, we propose Partial-GRPO. By modeling the outputs of LLMs as multiple
components rather than a single whole, our model can make more informed
preference selections for complex sequences, thereby enhancing its capacity to
learn complex CoT. Comprehensive evaluations and ablation studies on VaccineRAG
validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The code and dataset will be
publicly released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM基准主要关注性能指标，无法捕捉区分不同模型的细微行为特征，需要开发新的评估框架来理解模型的内在行为模式。

Method: 使用精心设计的诊断提示套件和自动化评估管道，其中强大LLM作为公正裁判，分析18个不同能力层级的模型，创建多方面的行为特征档案。

Result: 发现LLM领域存在关键分歧：顶级模型的核心能力（如抽象和因果推理）正在趋同，但对齐相关行为（如奉承和语义鲁棒性）差异巨大，并观察到跨模型的默认人格聚类（ISTJ/ESTJ）。

Conclusion: 模型的交互性质并非其规模或推理能力的涌现属性，而是特定且高度可变的开发者对齐策略的直接结果，该框架为揭示这些深层行为差异提供了可重复和可扩展的方法论。

Abstract: Current benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily focus on
performance metrics, often failing to capture the nuanced behavioral
characteristics that differentiate them. This paper introduces a novel
``Behavioral Fingerprinting'' framework designed to move beyond traditional
evaluation by creating a multi-faceted profile of a model's intrinsic cognitive
and interactive styles. Using a curated \textit{Diagnostic Prompt Suite} and an
innovative, automated evaluation pipeline where a powerful LLM acts as an
impartial judge, we analyze eighteen models across capability tiers. Our
results reveal a critical divergence in the LLM landscape: while core
capabilities like abstract and causal reasoning are converging among top
models, alignment-related behaviors such as sycophancy and semantic robustness
vary dramatically. We further document a cross-model default persona clustering
(ISTJ/ESTJ) that likely reflects common alignment incentives. Taken together,
this suggests that a model's interactive nature is not an emergent property of
its scale or reasoning power, but a direct consequence of specific, and highly
variable, developer alignment strategies. Our framework provides a reproducible
and scalable methodology for uncovering these deep behavioral differences.

Result: 实验结果显示相对36%的基准线，词误率相对降低16%，绝对降低6%

Conclusion: 该框架能够显著提高默语语音接口的可理解性，为语音合成识别提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Silent Speech Interfaces (SSIs) have gained attention for their ability to
generate intelligible speech from non-acoustic signals. While significant
progress has been made in advancing speech generation pipelines, limited work
has addressed the recognition and downstream processing of synthesized speech,
which often suffers from phonetic ambiguity and noise. To overcome these
challenges, we propose an enhanced automatic speech recognition framework that
combines a transformer-based acoustic model with a large language model (LLM)
for post-processing. The transformer captures full utterance context, while the
LLM ensures linguistic consistency. Experimental results show a 16% relative
and 6% absolute reduction in word error rate (WER) over a 36% baseline,
demonstrating substantial improvements in intelligibility for silent speech
interfaces.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems with smaller language models (SLMs) present a viable
alternative to single agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) for
addressing complex problems. In this work, we study how these alternatives
compare in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. To study this trade-off,
we instantiate single and multi-agent systems for the complex problems in the
AppWorld environment using different sized language models.
  We find that difficulties with long-trajectory learning in smaller language
models (SLMs) limit their performance. Even when trained for specialized roles,
SLMs fail to learn all subtasks effectively. To address this issue, we
introduce a simple progressive sub-task training strategy, which introduces new
sub-tasks progressively in each training epoch. We find that this novel
strategy, analogous to instance level curriculum learning, consistently
improves the effectiveness of multi-agents at all configurations. Our Pareto
analysis shows that fine-tuned multi-agent systems yield better
effectiveness-efficiency trade-offs. Additional ablations and analyses shows
the importance of our progressive training strategy and its ability to reduce
subtask error rates.

Abstract: This study explores the use of virtual reality (VR) and artificial
intelligence (AI) to predict the presence of dyslexia in Italian and Spanish
university students. In particular, the research investigates whether
VR-derived data from Silent Reading (SR) tests and self-esteem assessments can
differentiate between students that are affected by dyslexia and students that
are not, employing machine learning (ML) algorithms. Participants completed
VR-based tasks measuring reading performance and self-esteem. A preliminary
statistical analysis (t tests and Mann Whitney tests) on these data was
performed, to compare the obtained scores between individuals with and without
dyslexia, revealing significant differences in completion time for the SR test,
but not in accuracy, nor in self esteem. Then, supervised ML models were
trained and tested, demonstrating an ability to classify the presence/absence
of dyslexia with an accuracy of 87.5 per cent for Italian, 66.6 per cent for
Spanish, and 75.0 per cent for the pooled group. These findings suggest that VR
and ML can effectively be used as supporting tools for assessing dyslexia,
particularly by capturing differences in task completion speed, but
language-specific factors may influence classification accuracy.

Abstract: Understanding how large language models (LLMs) process emotionally sensitive
content is critical for building safe and reliable systems, particularly in
mental health contexts. We investigate the scaling behavior of LLMs on two key
tasks: trinary classification of emotional safety (safe vs. unsafe vs.
borderline) and multi-label classification using a six-category safety risk
taxonomy. To support this, we construct a novel dataset by merging several
human-authored mental health datasets (> 15K samples) and augmenting them with
emotion re-interpretation prompts generated via ChatGPT. We evaluate four LLaMA
models (1B, 3B, 8B, 70B) across zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings.
Our results show that larger LLMs achieve stronger average performance,
particularly in nuanced multi-label classification and in zero-shot settings.
However, lightweight fine-tuning allowed the 1B model to achieve performance
comparable to larger models and BERT in several high-data categories, while
requiring <2GB VRAM at inference. These findings suggest that smaller,
on-device models can serve as viable, privacy-preserving alternatives for
sensitive applications, offering the ability to interpret emotional context and
maintain safe conversational boundaries. This work highlights key implications
for therapeutic LLM applications and the scalable alignment of safety-critical
systems.

### [43] [Mitigation of Gender and Ethnicity Bias in AI-Generated Stories through Model Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04515)
*Martha O. Dimgba,Sharon Oba,Ameeta Agrawal,Philippe J. Giabbanelli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出BAME方法，通过模型自生成解释来指导提示工程，有效减少AI生成职业故事中的性别和种族偏见，改善幅度达2%-20%，无需修改模型参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在输出中传播社会偏见，特别是在性别和种族表征方面，需要开发有效的偏见缓解策略。

Method: 提出BAME方法，利用模型生成的解释来指导针对性提示工程，分析25个职业群体、3个大语言模型和多个人口统计维度的生成故事。

Result: 偏见缓解后人口统计表征改善2%-20%，识别出与训练数据刻板印象相关的过度表征和不足表征的持续模式。

Conclusion: 通过模型自身推理机制指导可以显著增强人口统计平等性，有助于开发更透明的生成式AI系统。

Abstract: Language models have been shown to propagate social bias through their
output, particularly in the representation of gender and ethnicity. This paper
investigates gender and ethnicity biases in AI-generated occupational stories.
Representation biases are measured before and after applying our proposed
mitigation strategy, Bias Analysis and Mitigation through Explanation (BAME),
revealing improvements in demographic representation ranging from 2% to 20%.
BAME leverages model-generated explanations to inform targeted prompt
engineering, effectively reducing biases without modifying model parameters. By
analyzing stories generated across 25 occupational groups, three large language
models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3.1 70B Instruct, and GPT-4 Turbo), and
multiple demographic dimensions, we identify persistent patterns of
overrepresentation and underrepresentation linked to training data stereotypes.
Our findings demonstrate that guiding models with their own internal reasoning
mechanisms can significantly enhance demographic parity, thereby contributing
to the development of more transparent generative AI systems.

*Sophie Jaffer,Simeon Sayer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过对比单语言BERT模型的性能，证实了多语言语言模型在非英语语言上的表现差异，说明翻译不能完全消除语言表征差异，本土语言训练对于可靠结果仍至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型扩展多语言能力，需要考察其在不同语言上的性能公平性。英语在训练数据中的主导地位可能会对非英语用户造成不利影响。

Method: 对比两个单语言BERT模型：一个完全在斯瓦希里语新闻数据上训练和测试，另一个在相应的英语数据上。通过将斯瓦希里语数据翻译成英语后用英语模型评估，模拟多语言模型的内部翻译处理过程。

Result: 尼斯瓦希里语训练的模型表现明显更好，错误率仅为0.36%，而翻译后用英语模型评估的错误率达到1.47%，相差近四倍。这说明翻译并不能完全消除语言间的表征差异。

Conclusion: 翻译单独无法完全桥接不同语言间的表征差异，本土语言训练对于获得可靠结果仍然至关重要。在教育和信息上下文中，即使小的性能差距也可能加剧不平等。未来应重点关注低代表性语言的数据集开发和多语言模型评估。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) expand multilingual capabilities, questions
remain about the equity of their performance across languages. While many
communities stand to benefit from AI systems, the dominance of English in
training data risks disadvantaging non-English speakers. To test the hypothesis
that such data disparities may affect model performance, this study compares
two monolingual BERT models: one trained and tested entirely on Swahili data,
and another on comparable English news data. To simulate how multilingual LLMs
process non-English queries through internal translation and abstraction, we
translated the Swahili news data into English and evaluated it using the
English-trained model. This approach tests the hypothesis by evaluating whether
translating Swahili inputs for evaluation on an English model yields better or
worse performance compared to training and testing a model entirely in Swahili,
thus isolating the effect of language consistency versus cross-lingual
abstraction. The results prove that, despite high-quality translation, the
native Swahili-trained model performed better than the Swahili-to-English
translated model, producing nearly four times fewer errors: 0.36% vs. 1.47%
respectively. This gap suggests that translation alone does not bridge
representational differences between languages and that models trained in one
language may struggle to accurately interpret translated inputs due to
imperfect internal knowledge representation, suggesting that native-language
training remains important for reliable outcomes. In educational and
informational contexts, even small performance gaps may compound inequality.
Future research should focus on addressing broader dataset development for
underrepresented languages and renewed attention to multilingual model
evaluation, ensuring the reinforcing effect of global AI deployment on existing
digital divides is reduced.

Motivation: 网片移植手术常见但术后并发症问题严重，需要了解病人的情感体验和关注点，以改善术前咨询和术后照护。

Method: 使用NRC Emotion Lexicon和TextBlob对MAUDE数据库2000-2021年的病人报告进行情感分析，分类为八种情绪和情感极性，识别关注报告并进行时间序列分析。

Result: 发现2011-2012年和2017-2018年间关注报告和情绪强度显著增加，这与医疗器械监管政策和技术进步相关。

Conclusion: 情感分析能够为医疗实践提供重要的病人体验见解，帮助改善术前咨询、术后照护和病人准备工作，强调了情感考量在医疗中的重要性。

Abstract: Mesh implants are widely utilized in hernia repair surgeries, but
postoperative complications present a significant concern. This study analyzes
patient reports from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience
(MAUDE) database spanning 2000 to 2021 to investigate the emotional aspects of
patients following mesh implantation using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
Employing the National Research Council Canada (NRC) Emotion Lexicon and
TextBlob for sentiment analysis, the research categorizes patient narratives
into eight emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy,
and disgust) and assesses sentiment polarity. The goal is to discern patterns
in patient sentiment over time and to identify reports signaling urgent
concerns, referred to as "Concern Reports," thereby understanding shifts in
patient experiences in relation to changes in medical device regulation and
technological advancements in healthcare. The study detected an increase in
Concern Reports and higher emotional intensity during the periods of 2011-2012
and 2017-2018. Through temporal analysis of Concern Reports and overall
sentiment, this research provides valuable insights for healthcare
practitioners, enhancing their understanding of patient experiences
post-surgery, which is critical for improving preoperative counselling,
postoperative care, and preparing patients for mesh implant surgeries. The
study underscores the importance of emotional considerations in medical
practices and the potential for sentiment analysis to inform and enhance
patient care.

TL;DR: 使用强化学习（特别是GRPO方法）提升小语言模型在工具使用方面的能力，解决SLMs在工具使用上相比LLMs的不足


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在工具使用方面表现出色，但由于资源需求大、计算复杂，无法适用于所有场景。小语言模型虽然更紧凑高效，但在工具使用能力上明显落后于大语言模型

Method: 采用强化学习方法，特别是Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)技术，来增强小语言模型的工具使用熟练度

Result: 该方法显著提升了小语言模型的工具使用准确率，增加了其实用价值

Conclusion: 相比传统的微调方法，GRPO强化学习方法提供了更高效、有效的解决方案，能够显著改善小语言模型的工具使用能力

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have progressed beyond simple text creation, and
tool use has become increasingly important for complex, real-world tasks. Tool
use in LLMs refers to their ability to utilize external resources such as APIs,
databases, or software functions to extend their functionality beyond
generating text.Tools are used for tasks such as performing calculations,
making API calls to retrieve the current time and date, and more. This
capability enables models to fetch real-time data, execute commands, or solve
problems requiring dynamic interaction, making it indispensable for
applications like AI agents in virtual assistants, robotic control, or
automated workflows.
  However, while LLMs are usually adept tool use, their vast resource
requirements and computation complexity restrict their use in every use case.As
a result, there is an increasing need for more compact and efficient Small
Language Models (SLMs). Small language models (SLMs) struggle in tool use
compared to large language models (LLMs). As soon in Table 1. SLMs are
typically trained on smaller, more specific datasets, resulting in a narrower
knowledge base and limited contextual understanding compared to LLMs.
  This research addresses these challenges by using Reinforcement Learning
(RL), specifically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to enhance
tool-use proficiency in SLMs. Unlike conventional fine-tuning approaches that
require heavy computation and often lack adaptability, our method provides an
efficient, effective solution that significantly boosts SLM tool-use accuracy,
increasing their practical utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从放射学报告中提取结构化临床信息具有挑战性，特别是在低资源语言（如希伯来语）和克罗恩病这种多器官发现稀疏表示的疾病中

Method: 基于提示的HSMP-BERT模型，使用分层结构化匹配预测方法，在9,683份希伯来语放射学报告数据集上进行训练和评估

Result: 在24个器官-发现组合上，HSMP-BERT达到平均F1分数0.83±0.08和κ系数0.65±0.17，显著优于基线方法，分层推理将运行时间减少5.1倍

Conclusion: HSMP-BERT为放射学结构化提取提供了可扩展的解决方案，支持克罗恩病的群体水平分析，展示了AI在低资源环境中的潜力

Abstract: Extracting structured clinical information from radiology reports is
challenging, especially in low-resource languages. This is pronounced in
Crohn's disease, with sparsely represented multi-organ findings. We developed
Hierarchical Structured Matching Prediction BERT (HSMP-BERT), a prompt-based
model for extraction from Hebrew radiology text. In an administrative database
study, we analyzed 9,683 reports from Crohn's patients imaged 2010-2023 across
Israeli providers. A subset of 512 reports was radiologist-annotated for
findings across six gastrointestinal organs and 15 pathologies, yielding 90
structured labels per subject. Multilabel-stratified split (66%
train+validation; 33% test), preserving label prevalence. Performance was
evaluated with accuracy, F1, Cohen's $\kappa$, AUC, PPV, NPV, and recall. On 24
organ-finding combinations with $>$15 positives, HSMP-BERT achieved mean F1
0.83$\pm$0.08 and $\kappa$ 0.65$\pm$0.17, outperforming the SMP zero-shot
baseline (F1 0.49$\pm$0.07, $\kappa$ 0.06$\pm$0.07) and standard fine-tuning
(F1 0.30$\pm$0.27, $\kappa$ 0.27$\pm$0.34; paired t-test $p < 10^{-7}$).
Hierarchical inference cuts runtime 5.1$\times$ vs. traditional inference.
Applied to all reports, it revealed associations among ileal wall thickening,
stenosis, and pre-stenotic dilatation, plus age- and sex-specific trends in
inflammatory findings. HSMP-BERT offers a scalable solution for structured
extraction in radiology, enabling population-level analysis of Crohn's disease
and demonstrating AI's potential in low-resource settings.

Motivation: 哨利亚长期武装冲突但缺乏系统性暴力记录，需要构建历史记忆和公开数据以支持政策分析。

Method: 使用GPT大语言模型阅读和分析超过20万篇西班牙语抱死报道，进行描述性分析和暴力与古印等植物清除关系研究。

Result: 构建了大规模暴力相关数据集，展示了大语言模型在大规模文本分析中的强大能力，为类似政策研究提供了可行方法。

Conclusion: 大语言模型开启了新的研究可能性，能够以前所未有的深度分析大规模文本语料，为历史记忆构建和政策分析做出重要贡献。

Abstract: Colombia has been submerged in decades of armed conflict, yet until recently,
the systematic documentation of violence was not a priority for the Colombian
government. This has resulted in a lack of publicly available conflict
information and, consequently, a lack of historical accounts. This study
contributes to Colombia's historical memory by utilizing GPT, a large language
model (LLM), to read and answer questions about over 200,000 violence-related
newspaper articles in Spanish. We use the resulting dataset to conduct both
descriptive analysis and a study of the relationship between violence and the
eradication of coca crops, offering an example of policy analyses that such
data can support. Our study demonstrates how LLMs have opened new research
opportunities by enabling examinations of large text corpora at a previously
infeasible depth.

Motivation: 大语言模型在生物医学NLP领域表现突出，但模型质量和计算需求的快速增长经了医疗场景中部署的障碍，因为数据隐私需要本地部署且资源有限。

Method: 系统性评估12个最先进的大语言模型（包括通用和生物医学专用模型）在8个标准数据集上的量化效果，涉及四个关键任务：命名实体识别、关系提取、多标签分类和问题答复。

Result: 量化能大幅降低GPU内存需求（最高可达75%），同时保持模型性能。这使得70B参数模型可在40GB消费级显卡上部署。领域专用知识和对高级提示方法的响应能力也大部分保持。

Conclusion: 量化是一种实用有效的策略，能够在生物医学领域实现大型高能力语言模型的安全本地部署，为AI技术进步与真实世界临床转化之间搭建桥梁。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in biomedical
natural language processing, yet their rapid growth in size and computational
requirements present a major barrier to adoption in healthcare settings where
data privacy precludes cloud deployment and resources are limited. In this
study, we systematically evaluated the impact of quantization on 12
state-of-the-art large language models, including both general-purpose and
biomedical-specific models, across eight benchmark datasets covering four key
tasks: named entity recognition, relation extraction, multi-label
classification, and question answering. We show that quantization substantially
reduces GPU memory requirements-by up to 75%-while preserving model performance
across diverse tasks, enabling the deployment of 70B-parameter models on 40GB
consumer-grade GPUs. In addition, domain-specific knowledge and responsiveness
to advanced prompting methods are largely maintained. These findings provide
significant practical and guiding value, highlighting quantization as a
practical and effective strategy for enabling the secure, local deployment of
large yet high-capacity language models in biomedical contexts, bridging the
gap between technical advances in AI and real-world clinical translation.

TL;DR: 提出SEMI方法，通过超网络适配器实现样本高效的多模态集成，只需少量样本即可将新模态集成到大型语言模型中


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态基础模型需要处理不断演变的多种模态，但从头训练不现实，且现有方法需要大量配对数据，而低资源模态往往缺乏这种数据

Method: 设计超网络来适配共享投影器，该投影器位于模态特定编码器和LLM之间。超网络在高资源模态上训练，在推理时根据任意模态的少量样本生成适配器。通过等距变换增加训练模态多样性

Result: SEMI在新模态集成中显著提升样本效率，例如达到相同准确率所需数据量减少64倍（32-shot SEMI vs 2048-shot传统方法）

Conclusion: SEMI有潜力扩展基础模型的模态覆盖范围，为低资源模态集成提供高效解决方案

Abstract: Multimodal foundation models can process several modalities. However, since
the space of possible modalities is large and evolving over time, training a
model from scratch to encompass all modalities is unfeasible. Moreover,
integrating a modality into a pre-existing foundation model currently requires
a significant amount of paired data, which is often not available for
low-resource modalities. In this paper, we introduce a method for
sample-efficient modality integration (SEMI) into Large Language Models (LLMs).
To this end, we devise a hypernetwork that can adapt a shared projector --
placed between modality-specific encoders and an LLM -- to any modality. The
hypernetwork, trained on high-resource modalities (i.e., text, speech, audio,
video), is conditioned on a few samples from any arbitrary modality at
inference time to generate a suitable adapter. To increase the diversity of
training modalities, we artificially multiply the number of encoders through
isometric transformations. We find that SEMI achieves a significant boost in
sample efficiency during few-shot integration of new modalities (i.e.,
satellite images, astronomical images, inertial measurements, and molecules)
with encoders of arbitrary embedding dimensionality. For instance, to reach the
same accuracy as 32-shot SEMI, training the projector from scratch needs
64$\times$ more data. As a result, SEMI holds promise to extend the modality
coverage of foundation models.

Motivation: 转换器语言模型在NLP任务中表现优异，但细粒度控制仍面临挑战。需要开发系统性方法来操纵模型行为，实现更精确的控制。

Method: 将可控文本生成形式化为优化问题，通过提示工程、参数效率微调、模型编辑和强化学习来解决。提出包含提示层面导航、激活干预和权重空间修改的统一框架。

Result: 理论上证明最小权重更新可以实现目标行为改变且副作用有限。实验结果显示在情感控制和事实修改中达到>90%成功率，同时保持基础性能，但存在泛化性-特异性的权衡。

Conclusion: 这项工作为设计可控制且健壮的语言模型奠定了基础，同时讨论了賞用风险和严格评估的必要性。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models excel in NLP tasks, but fine-grained
control remains challenging. This paper explores methods for manipulating
transformer models through principled interventions at three levels: prompts,
activations, and weights. We formalize controllable text generation as an
optimization problem addressable via prompt engineering, parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, model editing, and reinforcement learning. We introduce a unified
framework encompassing prompt-level steering, activation interventions, and
weight-space edits. We analyze robustness and safety implications, including
adversarial attacks and alignment mitigations. Theoretically, we show minimal
weight updates can achieve targeted behavior changes with limited side-effects.
Empirically, we demonstrate >90% success in sentiment control and factual edits
while preserving base performance, though generalization-specificity trade-offs
exist. We discuss ethical dual-use risks and the need for rigorous evaluation.
This work lays groundwork for designing controllable and robust language
models.

Abstract: Sign language datasets are often not representative in terms of vocabulary,
underscoring the need for models that generalize to unseen signs. Vector
quantization is a promising approach for learning discrete, token-like
representations, but it has not been evaluated whether the learned units
capture spurious correlations that hinder out-of-vocabulary performance. This
work investigates two phonological inductive biases: Parameter Disentanglement,
an architectural bias, and Phonological Semi-Supervision, a regularization
technique, to improve isolated sign recognition of known signs and
reconstruction quality of unseen signs with a vector-quantized autoencoder. The
primary finding is that the learned representations from the proposed model are
more effective for one-shot reconstruction of unseen signs and more
discriminative for sign identification compared to a controlled baseline. This
work provides a quantitative analysis of how explicit, linguistically-motivated
biases can improve the generalization of learned representations of sign
language.

Abstract: Sarcasm, a common feature of human communication, poses challenges in
interpersonal interactions and human-machine interactions. Linguistic research
has highlighted the importance of prosodic cues, such as variations in pitch,
speaking rate, and intonation, in conveying sarcastic intent. Although previous
work has focused on text-based sarcasm detection, the role of speech data in
recognizing sarcasm has been underexplored. Recent advancements in speech
technology emphasize the growing importance of leveraging speech data for
automatic sarcasm recognition, which can enhance social interactions for
individuals with neurodegenerative conditions and improve machine understanding
of complex human language use, leading to more nuanced interactions. This
systematic review is the first to focus on speech-based sarcasm recognition,
charting the evolution from unimodal to multimodal approaches. It covers
datasets, feature extraction, and classification methods, and aims to bridge
gaps across diverse research domains. The findings include limitations in
datasets for sarcasm recognition in speech, the evolution of feature extraction
techniques from traditional acoustic features to deep learning-based
representations, and the progression of classification methods from unimodal
approaches to multimodal fusion techniques. In so doing, we identify the need
for greater emphasis on cross-cultural and multilingual sarcasm recognition, as
well as the importance of addressing sarcasm as a multimodal phenomenon, rather
than a text-based challenge.

Abstract: In-Image Machine Translation (IIMT) aims to translate images containing texts
from one language to another. Current research of end-to-end IIMT mainly
conducts on synthetic data, with simple background, single font, fixed text
position, and bilingual translation, which can not fully reflect real world,
causing a significant gap between the research and practical conditions. To
facilitate research of IIMT in real-world scenarios, we explore Practical
In-Image Multilingual Machine Translation (IIMMT). In order to convince the
lack of publicly available data, we annotate the PRIM dataset, which contains
real-world captured one-line text images with complex background, various
fonts, diverse text positions, and supports multilingual translation
directions. We propose an end-to-end model VisTrans to handle the challenge of
practical conditions in PRIM, which processes visual text and background
information in the image separately, ensuring the capability of multilingual
translation while improving the visual quality. Experimental results indicate
the VisTrans achieves a better translation quality and visual effect compared
to other models. The code and dataset are available at:

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced critical
security challenges, where adversarial actors can manipulate input prompts to
cause significant harm and circumvent safety alignments. These prompt-based
attacks exploit vulnerabilities in a model's design, training, and contextual
understanding, leading to intellectual property theft, misinformation
generation, and erosion of user trust. A systematic understanding of these
attack vectors is the foundational step toward developing robust
countermeasures. This paper presents a comprehensive literature survey of
prompt-based attack methodologies, categorizing them to provide a clear threat
model. By detailing the mechanisms and impacts of these exploits, this survey
aims to inform the research community's efforts in building the next generation
of secure LLMs that are inherently resistant to unauthorized distillation,
fine-tuning, and editing.

Motivation: 社交媒体已成为灾害和公共安全紧急情况下的重要实时信息来源。自动分类灾害相关推文可以帮助应急服务更快、更有效地响应。传统机器学习模型在处理非正式、隐喻性或模糊语言时往往无法理解上下文或深层含义。

Method: 评估了基于Transformer的模型（包括BERT、DistilBERT、RoBERTa和DeBERTa）与传统机器学习方法（如逻辑回归、朴素贝叶斯和支持向量机）在灾难推文分类任务上的性能对比。

Result: BERT模型取得了最高准确率（91%），显著优于逻辑回归和朴素贝叶斯（均为82%）。Transformer模型通过上下文嵌入和注意力机制能够更好地理解推文中的微妙语言。

Conclusion: Transformer架构在公共安全应用中更为合适，提供了更高的准确性、更深的语言理解能力以及更好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Twitter and other social media platforms have become vital sources of real
time information during disasters and public safety emergencies. Automatically
classifying disaster related tweets can help emergency services respond faster
and more effectively. Traditional Machine Learning (ML) models such as Logistic
Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines have been widely used for
this task, but they often fail to understand the context or deeper meaning of
words, especially when the language is informal, metaphorical, or ambiguous. We
posit that, in this context, transformer based models can perform better than
traditional ML models. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of
transformer based models, including BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTa, for
classifying disaster related tweets. These models are compared with traditional
ML approaches to highlight the performance gap. Experimental results show that
BERT achieved the highest accuracy (91%), significantly outperforming
traditional models like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes (both at 82%). The
use of contextual embeddings and attention mechanisms allows transformer models
to better understand subtle language in tweets, where traditional ML models
fall short. This research demonstrates that transformer architectures are far
more suitable for public safety applications, offering improved accuracy,
deeper language understanding, and better generalization across real world
social media text.

*Ayush Gupta,Ramneet Kaur,Anirban Roy,Adam D. Cobb,Rama Chellappa,Susmit Jha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过模型的dropout容忍度来检测语义外输入，使用ICAD框架确保理论错误控制，在医疗LLM中显著提升OOD检测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细化后的大语言模型虽在领域内任务表现优异，但面对领域外输入时仍可能产生错误输出，存在应用风险

Method: 基于ICAD框架，提出dropout容忍度作为新的非适配度量，并通过有效的集成方法汇总多层的dropout容忍度

Result: 在医疗专业LLM上试验，方法在OOD检测上显著超过基线方法，AUROC提升2%-37%，同时保持理论错误报警约束

Conclusion: 通过dropout容忍度检测OOD输入是有效的方法，能够在不破坏模型性能的前提下提高安全性，适用于关键应用场景

Abstract: We propose a novel inference-time out-of-domain (OOD) detection algorithm for
specialized large language models (LLMs). Despite achieving state-of-the-art
performance on in-domain tasks through fine-tuning, specialized LLMs remain
vulnerable to incorrect or unreliable outputs when presented with OOD inputs,
posing risks in critical applications. Our method leverages the Inductive
Conformal Anomaly Detection (ICAD) framework, using a new non-conformity
measure based on the model's dropout tolerance. Motivated by recent findings on
polysemanticity and redundancy in LLMs, we hypothesize that in-domain inputs
exhibit higher dropout tolerance than OOD inputs. We aggregate dropout
tolerance across multiple layers via a valid ensemble approach, improving
detection while maintaining theoretical false alarm bounds from ICAD.
Experiments with medical-specialized LLMs show that our approach detects OOD
inputs better than baseline methods, with AUROC improvements of $2\%$ to $37\%$
when treating OOD datapoints as positives and in-domain test datapoints as
negatives.

TL;DR: 首个针对阿拉伯语和大语言模型在阿拉伯语生成任务中的幻觉评估研究，评估了12个模型在问答和摘要任务中的表现，发现事实幻觉比忠实性错误更普遍，阿拉伯语预训练模型表现最佳


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有关于大语言模型幻觉的研究主要集中在英语，而阿拉伯语作为全球重要语言，其多语言和阿拉伯语专用LLMs的幻觉评估相对不足，需要填补这一研究空白

Method: 开发了包含12个细粒度幻觉指标的评估框架，在阿拉伯语生成问答和摘要两个关键任务上评估了12个LLMs（4个阿拉伯语预训练模型、4个多语言模型、4个推理模型）

Result: 事实幻觉在所有模型和任务中比忠实性错误更普遍；阿拉伯语预训练模型Allam始终表现出比多语言模型更低的幻觉率，与推理模型性能相当

Conclusion: 阿拉伯语专用模型在减少幻觉方面表现优于多语言模型，强调了针对特定语言优化的重要性；提出的细粒度评估框架为阿拉伯语NLG任务的幻觉评估提供了有效工具

Abstract: Recently, extensive research on the hallucination of the large language
models (LLMs) has mainly focused on the English language. Despite the growing
number of multilingual and Arabic-specific LLMs, evaluating LLMs' hallucination
in the Arabic context remains relatively underexplored. The knowledge gap is
particularly pressing given Arabic's widespread use across many regions and its
importance in global communication and media. This paper presents the first
comprehensive hallucination evaluation of Arabic and multilingual LLMs on two
critical Arabic natural language generation tasks: generative question
answering (GQA) and summarization. This study evaluates a total of 12 LLMs,
including 4 Arabic pre-trained models, 4 multilingual models, and 4
reasoning-based models. To assess the factual consistency and faithfulness of
LLMs' outputs, we developed a fine-grained hallucination evaluation framework
consisting of 12 fine-grained hallucination indicators that represent the
varying characteristics of each task. The results reveal that factual
hallucinations are more prevalent than faithfulness errors across all models
and tasks. Notably, the Arabic pre-trained model Allam consistently
demonstrates lower hallucination rates than multilingual models and a
comparative performance with reasoning-based models. The code is available at:

*Mohammadtaher Safarzadeh,Afshin Oroojlooyjadid,Dan Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于SQL2NL的模式对齐释义框架，用于自动生成语义等价但词汇多样的查询，从而系统评估NL2SQL模型对语言变化的鲁棒性。研究发现现有SOTA模型比标准基准测试显示的要脆弱得多，性能下降显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NL2SQL基准测试很少系统或受控地处理语言变化因素，无法真正理解模型的泛化能力。需要一种方法来专门评估模型对纯粹语言变化的鲁棒性，而不是之前的模糊性或模式扰动研究。

Method: 提出新颖的模式对齐释义框架，利用SQL-to-NL技术自动生成语义等价但词汇多样的查询，同时保持与原始模式和意图的对齐，实现针对语言变化的隔离评估。

Result: SOTA模型比标准基准测试显示的要脆弱得多：LLaMa3.3-70B在释义查询上执行准确率下降10.23%（77.11%→66.9%），LLaMa3.1-8B下降近20%（62.9%→42.5%）。小模型受影响更严重，鲁棒性退化程度随查询复杂度、数据集和领域显著变化。

Conclusion: 需要明确测量语言泛化能力的评估框架，以确保NL2SQL模型在真实世界设置中的可靠性能。当前模型对语言变化的鲁棒性严重不足，标准基准测试无法反映真实性能。

Abstract: Robust evaluation in the presence of linguistic variation is key to
understanding the generalization capabilities of Natural Language to SQL
(NL2SQL) models, yet existing benchmarks rarely address this factor in a
systematic or controlled manner. We propose a novel schema-aligned paraphrasing
framework that leverages SQL-to-NL (SQL2NL) to automatically generate
semantically equivalent, lexically diverse queries while maintaining alignment
with the original schema and intent. This enables the first targeted evaluation
of NL2SQL robustness to linguistic variation in isolation-distinct from prior
work that primarily investigates ambiguity or schema perturbations. Our
analysis reveals that state-of-the-art models are far more brittle than
standard benchmarks suggest. For example, LLaMa3.3-70B exhibits a 10.23% drop
in execution accuracy (from 77.11% to 66.9%) on paraphrased Spider queries,
while LLaMa3.1-8B suffers an even larger drop of nearly 20% (from 62.9% to
42.5%). Smaller models (e.g., GPT-4o mini) are disproportionately affected. We
also find that robustness degradation varies significantly with query
complexity, dataset, and domain -- highlighting the need for evaluation
frameworks that explicitly measure linguistic generalization to ensure reliable
performance in real-world settings.

*Adam Tauman Kalai,Ofir Nachum,Santosh S. Vempala,Edwin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 语言模型产生幻觉是因为训练和评估过程奖励猜测而非承认不确定性，这源于二元分类错误和测试优化策略，需要通过修改评分标准来解决。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在不确定时会猜测而产生错误陈述（幻觉），这削弱了信任度。研究旨在分析幻觉的统计原因并提出解决方案。

Method: 分析现代训练流程中幻觉的统计成因，论证幻觉源于二元分类错误，并指出评估评分机制对猜测行为的奖励是问题根源。

Result: 发现幻觉不是神秘现象，而是统计压力的自然结果；当前评估体系惩罚不确定性回答，导致模型选择猜测而非承认不确定。

Conclusion: 需要通过修改现有错误对齐但主导排行榜的基准评分标准来解决幻觉问题，而不是引入额外的幻觉评估，从而推动更可信的AI系统发展。

Abstract: Like students facing hard exam questions, large language models sometimes
guess when uncertain, producing plausible yet incorrect statements instead of
admitting uncertainty. Such "hallucinations" persist even in state-of-the-art
systems and undermine trust. We argue that language models hallucinate because
the training and evaluation procedures reward guessing over acknowledging
uncertainty, and we analyze the statistical causes of hallucinations in the
modern training pipeline. Hallucinations need not be mysterious -- they
originate simply as errors in binary classification. If incorrect statements
cannot be distinguished from facts, then hallucinations in pretrained language
models will arise through natural statistical pressures. We then argue that
hallucinations persist due to the way most evaluations are graded -- language
models are optimized to be good test-takers, and guessing when uncertain
improves test performance. This "epidemic" of penalizing uncertain responses
can only be addressed through a socio-technical mitigation: modifying the
scoring of existing benchmarks that are misaligned but dominate leaderboards,
rather than introducing additional hallucination evaluations. This change may
steer the field toward more trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are foundational to many AI applications, but
maintaining their freshness and completeness remains costly. We present ODKE+,
a production-grade system that automatically extracts and ingests millions of
open-domain facts from web sources with high precision. ODKE+ combines modular
components into a scalable pipeline: (1) the Extraction Initiator detects
missing or stale facts, (2) the Evidence Retriever collects supporting
documents, (3) hybrid Knowledge Extractors apply both pattern-based rules and
ontology-guided prompting for large language models (LLMs), (4) a lightweight
Grounder validates extracted facts using a second LLM, and (5) the Corroborator
ranks and normalizes candidate facts for ingestion. ODKE+ dynamically generates
ontology snippets tailored to each entity type to align extractions with schema
constraints, enabling scalable, type-consistent fact extraction across 195
predicates. The system supports batch and streaming modes, processing over 9
million Wikipedia pages and ingesting 19 million high-confidence facts with
98.8% precision. ODKE+ significantly improves coverage over traditional
methods, achieving up to 48% overlap with third-party KGs and reducing update
lag by 50 days on average. Our deployment demonstrates that LLM-based
extraction, grounded in ontological structure and verification workflows, can
deliver trustworthiness, production-scale knowledge ingestion with broad
real-world applicability. A recording of the system demonstration is included

Motivation: 传统知识图谱问答方法依赖语义解析，检索严格必要的知识，但由于模式刚性要求和语义模糊性，往往覆盖率较低。需要一种能够检索更广泛相关信息的方法来改善问答性能。

Method: 提出KERAG管道，采用检索-过滤-摘要方法：首先检索可能包含相关信息的大量子图，然后过滤噪声，最后使用微调的LLM在知识子图上进行思维链推理来生成答案。

Result: 实验表明KERAG在质量上超越最先进解决方案约7%，并超过GPT-4o（工具）10-21%，对简单和复杂问题都能有效改善问答性能。

Conclusion: KERAG通过检索更广泛的知识子图和结合思维链推理，有效提高了知识图谱问答的覆盖率和准确性，为基于知识图谱的检索增强生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucination in Large
Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external data, with Knowledge Graphs
(KGs) offering crucial information for question answering. Traditional
Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) methods rely on semantic parsing,
which typically retrieves knowledge strictly necessary for answer generation,
thus often suffer from low coverage due to rigid schema requirements and
semantic ambiguity. We present KERAG, a novel KG-based RAG pipeline that
enhances QA coverage by retrieving a broader subgraph likely to contain
relevant information. Our retrieval-filtering-summarization approach, combined
with fine-tuned LLMs for Chain-of-Thought reasoning on knowledge sub-graphs,
reduces noises and improves QA for both simple and complex questions.
Experiments demonstrate that KERAG surpasses state-of-the-art solutions by
about 7% in quality and exceeds GPT-4o (Tool) by 10-21%.

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) is a key technology to extract important
patient information from clinical narratives to support healthcare
applications. The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has
revolutionized many NLP tasks in the clinical domain, yet their optimal use in
patient information extraction tasks requires further exploration. This study
examines LLMs' effectiveness in patient information extraction, focusing on LLM
architectures, fine-tuning strategies, and multi-task instruction tuning
techniques for developing robust and generalizable patient information
extraction systems. This study aims to explore key concepts of using LLMs for
clinical concept and relation extraction tasks, including: (1) encoder-only or
decoder-only LLMs, (2) prompt-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
algorithms, and (3) multi-task instruction tuning on few-shot learning
performance. We benchmarked a suite of LLMs, including encoder-based LLMs
(BERT, GatorTron) and decoder-based LLMs (GatorTronGPT, Llama 3.1,
GatorTronLlama), across five datasets. We compared traditional full-size
fine-tuning and prompt-based PEFT. We explored a multi-task instruction tuning
framework that combines both tasks across four datasets to evaluate the
zero-shot and few-shot learning performance using the leave-one-dataset-out
strategy.

Abstract: Accurately answering complex questions has consistently been a significant
challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). To address this, this paper
proposes a multi-hop question decomposition method for complex questions,
building upon research within the MQUAKE framework. Utilizing the LLAMA3 model,
we systematically investigate the impact of multi-hop question decomposition
within knowledge graphs on model comprehension and reasoning accuracy, both
before and after model training. In our experiments, we systematically
partitioned and converted the MQUAKE-T dataset into two distinct formats: a
single-hop dataset designed for directly answering complex questions, and a
multi-hop dataset constructed using the multi-hop question decomposition
method. We then fine-tuned the LLAMA3 model on these datasets and conducted
inference tests. Our results demonstrate that, without fine-tuning the LLM, the
prediction performance based on the multi-hop question decomposition method
significantly outperforms the method of directly answering complex questions.
After fine-tuning using the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) method, the performance
of both approaches improved compared to the untrained baseline. Crucially, the
method utilizing multi-hop decomposition consistently maintained its
superiority. These findings validate the effectiveness of the multi-hop
decomposition method both before and after training, demonstrating its
capability to effectively enhance the LLM's ability to answer complex
questions.

Abstract: From the dawn of the computer, Allen Turing dreamed of a robot that could
communicate using language as a human being. The recent advances in the field
of Large Language Models (LLMs) shocked the scientific community when a single
model can apply for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, while the
output results are sometimes even better than most human communication skills.
Models such as GPT, Claude, Grok, etc. have left their mark on the scientific
community. However, it is unclear how much these models understand what they
produce, especially in a nuanced theme such as humor. The question of whether
computers understand humor is still open (among the decoders, the latest to be
checked was GPT-2). We addressed this issue in this paper; we have showed that
a fine-tuned decoder (GPT-4o) performed (Mean F1-macro score of 0.85) as well
as the best fine-tuned encoder (RoBERTa with a Mean of F1-score 0.86)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调和强化学习虽然能提升模型性能，但会降低输出多样性，导致响应变得狭窄和规范化。现有方法要么在推理时操作，要么只关注词汇差异，存在局限性

Method: 基于行列式点过程(DPPs)，对每个提示采样并嵌入一组响应，使用基于核的相似性矩阵的行列式来测量嵌入响应之间的语义多样性体积

Result: 在指令跟随、摘要、故事生成和推理任务上的实验表明，该方法在不牺牲模型质量的情况下显著提高了语义多样性

Conclusion: DQO方法有效解决了LLM微调后多样性下降的问题，能够同时优化质量和语义多样性，为LLM后训练提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning are two popular methods for
post-training large language models (LLMs). While improving the model's
performance on downstream tasks, they often reduce the model's output
diversity, leading to narrow, canonical responses. Existing methods to enhance
diversity are limited, either by operating at inference time or by focusing on
lexical differences. We propose a novel training method named DQO based on
determinantal point processes (DPPs) to jointly optimize LLMs for quality and
semantic diversity. Our approach samples and embeds a group of responses for
each prompt, then uses the determinant of a kernel-based similarity matrix to
measure diversity as the volume spanned by the embeddings of these responses.
Experiments across instruction-following, summarization, story generation, and
reasoning tasks demonstrate that our method substantially improves semantic
diversity without sacrificing model quality.

Abstract: Personality manipulation in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
applied in customer service and agentic scenarios, yet its mechanisms and
trade-offs remain unclear. We present a systematic study of personality control
using the Big Five traits, comparing in-context learning (ICL),
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), and mechanistic steering (MS). Our
contributions are fourfold. First, we construct a contrastive dataset with
balanced high/low trait responses, enabling effective steering vector
computation and fair cross-method evaluation. Second, we introduce a unified
evaluation framework based on within-run $\Delta$ analysis that disentangles,
reasoning capability, agent performance, and demographic bias across MMLU,
GAIA, and BBQ benchmarks. Third, we develop trait purification techniques to
separate openness from conscientiousness, addressing representational overlap
in trait encoding. Fourth, we propose a three-level stability framework that
quantifies method-, trait-, and combination-level robustness, offering
practical guidance under deployment constraints. Experiments on Gemma-2-2B-IT
and LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct reveal clear trade-offs: ICL achieves strong alignment
with minimal capability loss, PEFT delivers the highest alignment at the cost
of degraded task performance, and MS provides lightweight runtime control with
competitive effectiveness. Trait-level analysis shows openness as uniquely
challenging, agreeableness as most resistant to ICL, and personality encoding
consolidating around intermediate layers. Taken together, these results
establish personality manipulation as a multi-level probe into behavioral
representation, linking surface conditioning, parameter encoding, and
activation-level steering, and positioning mechanistic steering as a
lightweight alternative to fine-tuning for both deployment and
interpretability.

Motivation: 由于人类编写内容稀缺，大语言模型越来越依赖合成数据，但递归训练模型生成输出会导致模型崩溃，威胁事实可靠性。需要研究这种退化过程及其缓解方法。

Method: 通过控制实验进行递归合成训练，分析指令格式对崩溃的影响，提出领域特定合成训练策略，并开发结合模型中心和任务中心指标的评估框架。

Conclusion: 研究提供了关于崩溃动态的理论见解，并为知识密集型应用中可持续AI训练提供了实用指导，特别是在准确性至关重要的领域。

Abstract: Large language models increasingly rely on synthetic data due to
human-written content scarcity, yet recursive training on model-generated
outputs leads to model collapse, a degenerative process threatening factual
reliability. We define knowledge collapse as a distinct three-stage phenomenon
where factual accuracy deteriorates while surface fluency persists, creating
"confidently wrong" outputs that pose critical risks in accuracy-dependent
domains. Through controlled experiments with recursive synthetic training, we
demonstrate that collapse trajectory and timing depend critically on
instruction format, distinguishing instruction-following collapse from
traditional model collapse through its conditional, prompt-dependent nature. We
propose domain-specific synthetic training as a targeted mitigation strategy
that achieves substantial improvements in collapse resistance while maintaining
computational efficiency. Our evaluation framework combines model-centric
indicators with task-centric metrics to detect distinct degradation phases,
enabling reproducible assessment of epistemic deterioration across different
language models. These findings provide both theoretical insights into collapse
dynamics and practical guidance for sustainable AI training in
knowledge-intensive applications where accuracy is paramount.

*Ilham Wicaksono,Zekun Wu,Theo King,Adriano Koshiyama,Philip Treleaven*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AgentSeer是一个基于可观测性的评估框架，用于系统评估语言模型在代理系统中的安全风险，揭示了传统模型级评估无法发现的代理特有漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型向代理系统过渡，当前的安全评估框架在评估部署特定风险方面存在关键差距，需要新的评估范式来发现代理情境中的特有漏洞。

Method: 通过将代理执行分解为细粒度的动作和组件图，使用HarmBench单轮和迭代精化攻击对GPT-OSS-20B和Gemini-2.0-flash进行跨模型验证。

Result: 发现工具调用攻击成功率比模型级高24-60%，识别出代理特有漏洞、通用代理模式、语义漏洞机制和上下文依赖的攻击有效性。直接攻击从模型级转移到代理情境时性能下降，但上下文感知的迭代攻击能够成功攻破模型级无法达成的目标。

Conclusion: 研究结果确立了代理情境评估范式的迫切需求，AgentSeer提供了标准化方法和实证验证，填补了系统评估差距。

Abstract: As large language models transition to agentic systems, current safety
evaluation frameworks face critical gaps in assessing deployment-specific
risks. We introduce AgentSeer, an observability-based evaluation framework that
decomposes agentic executions into granular action and component graphs,
enabling systematic agentic-situational assessment. Through cross-model
validation on GPT-OSS-20B and Gemini-2.0-flash using HarmBench single turn and
iterative refinement attacks, we demonstrate fundamental differences between
model-level and agentic-level vulnerability profiles. Model-level evaluation
reveals baseline differences: GPT-OSS-20B (39.47% ASR) versus Gemini-2.0-flash
(50.00% ASR), with both models showing susceptibility to social engineering
while maintaining logic-based attack resistance. However, agentic-level
assessment exposes agent-specific risks invisible to traditional evaluation. We
discover "agentic-only" vulnerabilities that emerge exclusively in agentic
contexts, with tool-calling showing 24-60% higher ASR across both models.
Cross-model analysis reveals universal agentic patterns, agent transfer
operations as highest-risk tools, semantic rather than syntactic vulnerability
mechanisms, and context-dependent attack effectiveness, alongside
model-specific security profiles in absolute ASR levels and optimal injection
strategies. Direct attack transfer from model-level to agentic contexts shows
degraded performance (GPT-OSS-20B: 57% human injection ASR; Gemini-2.0-flash:
28%), while context-aware iterative attacks successfully compromise objectives
that failed at model-level, confirming systematic evaluation gaps. These
findings establish the urgent need for agentic-situation evaluation paradigms,
with AgentSeer providing the standardized methodology and empirical validation.

*Alexandre Nikolaev,Yu-Ying Chuang,R. Harald Baayen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨判别式词典模型(DLM)是否能在不建立屈折类别的情况下理解和生成芬兰语屈折名词，结果显示模型在训练数据上表现优异，测试数据准确率可接受，但对非生产性类别的处理存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究屈折类别是否具有认知现实性，即母语者是否需要发现这些类别才能正确屈折名词，以及DLM模型能否在不建立屈折类别的情况下处理芬兰语名词屈折。

Method: 使用包含55,271个屈折名词的数据集，涵盖2000个高频芬兰语名词和49个屈折类别。建立多个DLM理解和生成模型，包括不考虑使用频率的无限暴露学习模型和考虑词频的使用频率模型。

Result: 模型在训练数据上准确率很高，测试数据准确率有所下降但仍可接受。模型对类型更多、低频词更多、罕见词更多的生产性屈折类别表现更好，但对非生产性类别的处理存在困难。在使用频率模型中，频率是性能的主要预测因子。

Conclusion: DLM模型能够在不需要明确屈折类别的情况下学习芬兰语名词屈折，但模型性能受到屈折类别生产性和词频的影响，支持了基于使用的语言学习观点。

Abstract: Descriptions of complex nominal or verbal systems make use of inflectional
classes. Inflectional classes bring together nouns which have similar stem
changes and use similar exponents in their paradigms. Although inflectional
classes can be very useful for language teaching as well as for setting up
finite state morphological systems, it is unclear whether inflectional classes
are cognitively real, in the sense that native speakers would need to discover
these classes in order to learn how to properly inflect the nouns of their
language. This study investigates whether the Discriminative Lexicon Model
(DLM) can understand and produce Finnish inflected nouns without setting up
inflectional classes, using a dataset with 55,271 inflected nouns of 2000
high-frequency Finnish nouns from 49 inflectional classes. Several DLM
comprehension and production models were set up. Some models were not informed
about frequency of use, and provide insight into learnability with infinite
exposure (endstate learning). Other models were set up from a usage based
perspective, and were trained with token frequencies being taken into
consideration (frequency-informed learning). On training data, models performed
with very high accuracies. For held-out test data, accuracies decreased, as
expected, but remained acceptable. Across most models, performance increased
for inflectional classes with more types, more lower-frequency words, and more
hapax legomena, mirroring the productivity of the inflectional classes. The
model struggles more with novel forms of unproductive and less productive
classes, and performs far better for unseen forms belonging to productive
classes. However, for usage-based production models, frequency was the dominant
predictor of model performance, and correlations with measures of productivity
were tenuous or absent.

Motivation: 解决语音理解系统中标签训练数据稀缺以及大语言模型在实际应用中计算资源负担过大的挑战

Method: 提出适应性特征蓄簍框架，使用踢余投影神经网络(RPNN)的动态适配器对齐异构特征空间，并通过动态蓄簍系数(DDC)根据意图和槽位预测性能进行实时调节

Conclusion: 该方法通过高效的知识蓄簍技术，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了计算资源需求，为实际应用提供了可行解决方案

Abstract: Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) is a core component of conversational
systems, enabling machines to interpret user utterances. Despite its
importance, developing effective SLU systems remains challenging due to the
scarcity of labeled training data and the computational burden of deploying
Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications. To further alleviate
these issues, we propose an Adaptive Feature Distillation framework that
transfers rich semantic representations from a General Text Embeddings
(GTE)-based teacher model to a lightweight student model. Our method introduces
a dynamic adapter equipped with a Residual Projection Neural Network (RPNN) to
align heterogeneous feature spaces, and a Dynamic Distillation Coefficient
(DDC) that adaptively modulates the distillation strength based on real-time
feedback from intent and slot prediction performance. Experiments on the
Chinese profile-based ProSLU benchmark demonstrate that AFD-SLU achieves
state-of-the-art results, with 95.67% intent accuracy, 92.02% slot F1 score,
and 85.50% overall accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型的泛化能力是来自对训练数据的简单记忆还是深层的语义理解，这是一个关键问题。

Method: 提出了双视角评估框架：1）模型输出视角-通过回答场景相关问题评估；2）内部表示视角-探测内部表示中编码的场景元素-论元关联。构建了基于场景的数据集，包含虚构事实的文本描述和场景元素标注。

Result: 实验表明当前大语言模型主要依赖表层记忆，即使在简单情况下也无法实现稳健的语义场景认知。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了LLMs在语义理解方面的关键局限性，为提升其能力提供了认知洞见。

Abstract: Driven by vast and diverse textual data, large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated impressive performance across numerous natural language processing
(NLP) tasks. Yet, a critical question persists: does their generalization arise
from mere memorization of training data or from deep semantic understanding? To
investigate this, we propose a bi-perspective evaluation framework to assess
LLMs' scenario cognition - the ability to link semantic scenario elements with
their arguments in context. Specifically, we introduce a novel scenario-based
dataset comprising diverse textual descriptions of fictional facts, annotated
with scenario elements. LLMs are evaluated through their capacity to answer
scenario-related questions (model output perspective) and via probing their
internal representations for encoded scenario elements-argument associations
(internal representation perspective). Our experiments reveal that current LLMs
predominantly rely on superficial memorization, failing to achieve robust
semantic scenario cognition, even in simple cases. These findings expose
critical limitations in LLMs' semantic understanding and offer cognitive
insights for advancing their capabilities.

TL;DR: 使用大语言模型和多步骤管线的多语言临床实体标注方法，在西班牙语和希腊语数据集上实现了高准确的ICD-10编码预测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化ICD-10编码可以简化医疗专业人员工作保证医院编码一致性，但不同语言的临床文本编码面临挑战

Method: 多步骤管线：先使用临床词典匹配明确的术语，然后用GPT-4.1通过上下文学习预测术语词典无法匹配的项目的ICD-10代码

Result: 在西班牙语CodiEsp数据集上获得0.89类别F1分和0.78子类F1分，在希腊语ElCardioCC数据集上获得0.85 F1分

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理多语言临床文本的ICD-10编码问题，为医疗信息自动化处理提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: The linking of clinical entities is a crucial part of extracting structured
information from clinical texts. It is the process of assigning a code from a
medical ontology or classification to a phrase in the text. The International
Classification of Diseases - 10th revision (ICD-10) is an international
standard for classifying diseases for statistical and insurance purposes.
Automatically assigning the correct ICD-10 code to terms in discharge summaries
will simplify the work of healthcare professionals and ensure consistent coding
in hospitals. Our paper proposes an approach for linking clinical terms to
ICD-10 codes in different languages using Large Language Models (LLMs). The
approach consists of a multistage pipeline that uses clinical dictionaries to
match unambiguous terms in the text and then applies in-context learning with
GPT-4.1 to predict the ICD-10 code for the terms that do not match the
dictionary. Our system shows promising results in predicting ICD-10 codes on
different benchmark datasets in Spanish - 0.89 F1 for categories and 0.78 F1 on
subcategories on CodiEsp, and Greek - 0.85 F1 on ElCardioCC.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型微调时的高计算需求问题，特别是在资源受限的情况下，需要更高效的微调方法

Method: 使用L1正则化修剪冗余秩并重新分配适配器秩，给定秩预算约束下动态优化低秩适配器的分布

Result: L1RA在保持或减少计算开销的同时，达到与其他LoRA变体相当或更好的性能，并发现前馈层和注意力输出投影层需要最多适配

Conclusion: L1RA是提升LLM微调效率和可解释性的有前景技术，特别适用于计算资源受限的场景

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks has made
them crucial in the development of AI-based applications. However, the high
computational requirements to fine-tune these LLMs on downstream tasks pose
significant challenges, particularly when resources are limited. In response to
this challenge, we introduce L1RA, a novel technique aimed at dynamically
distributing the rank of low-rank adapters during fine-tuning using LoRA. Given
a rank budget (i.e., total sum of adapters rank), L1RA leverages L1
regularisation to prune redundant ranks and redistribute them across adapters,
thereby optimising resource utilisation. Through a series of comprehensive
experiments, we empirically demonstrate that L1RA maintains comparable or even
reduced computational overhead compared to other LoRA variants, including the
vanilla approach, while achieving same or better performances. Moreover, the
post-training analysis of rank distribution unveiled insights into the specific
model components requiring the most adaptation to align with the task
objective: the feed-forward layers and the attention output projection. These
results highlight the efficacy of L1RA in not only enhancing the efficiency of
LLM fine-tuning, but also in providing valuable diagnostic information for
model refinement and customisation. In conclusion, L1RA stands as a promising
technique for advancing the performance and interpretability of LLM adaptation,
particularly in scenarios where computational resources are constrained.

full attention via continual pre-training to support 32K token contexts.
Training leverages extensive synthetic corpora to overcome data scarcity, while
computational efficiency is achieved through weight reuse and structured
pruning. This efficient pruning methodology produces an 8B model that achieves
performance comparable to our previous 100B model. Post-training further
refines the models using a pipeline of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct
preference optimization (DPO), enhanced by synthetic Japanese instruction data
and model merging techniques. Optimized for inference using vLLM and
quantization with minimal accuracy loss, the PLaMo 2 models achieve
state-of-the-art results on Japanese benchmarks, outperforming similarly-sized
open models in instruction-following, language fluency, and Japanese-specific
knowledge.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过度依赖稀缺的高质量长文本响应数据进行监督微调或成对偏好奖励，且只关注粗粒度的质量优化维度，忽略了不同长文本生成场景的细粒度特性

Method: ACE-RL框架：1）自动将指令解构为细粒度的自适应约束标准；2）设计基于约束满足度的奖励机制；3）使用强化学习指导模型生成高质量长文本

Result: 在WritingBench上显著超越现有SFT和RL基线方法20.70%和7.32%，最佳模型甚至超越GPT-4o达7.10%

Conclusion: ACE-RL为LLMs提供了更有效的训练范式，能够在多样化长文本生成场景中生成高质量内容

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
long-context understanding, yet they face significant challenges in
high-quality long-form generation. Existing studies primarily suffer from two
limitations: (1) A heavy reliance on scarce, high-quality long-form response
data for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or for pairwise preference reward in
reinforcement learning (RL). (2) Focus on coarse-grained quality optimization
dimensions, such as relevance, coherence, and helpfulness, overlooking the
fine-grained specifics inherent to diverse long-form generation scenarios. To
address this issue, we propose a framework using Adaptive Constraint-Enhanced
reward for long-form generation Reinforcement Learning (ACE-RL). ACE-RL first
automatically deconstructs each instruction into a set of fine-grained,
adaptive constraint criteria by identifying its underlying intents and demands.
Subsequently, we design a reward mechanism that quantifies the quality of
long-form responses based on their satisfaction over corresponding constraints,
converting subjective quality evaluation into constraint verification. Finally,
we utilize reinforcement learning to guide models toward superior long-form
generation capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our ACE-RL
framework significantly outperforms existing SFT and RL baselines by 20.70% and
7.32% on WritingBench, and our top-performing model even surpasses proprietary
systems like GPT-4o by 7.10%, providing a more effective training paradigm for
LLMs to generate high-quality content across diverse long-form generation
scenarios.

Motivation: 医院分流记录含有丰富的临床信息，但处理这些数据面临三大挑战：数据敏感性引发隐私问题，医院硬件资源不足以训练大模型，以及需要专家手动标注的高成本

Method: 首先在GPU上使用2k样本的开源数据微调预训练LLM分类器，然后在CPU上使用1000样本的医院特定数据进一步微调

Result: 通过精心管理数据集并利用现有模型和开源数据，成功在限制计算资源下完成分流数据分类

Conclusion: 该流水线提供了一种可行方案，能够在保护病人隐私的同时，充分利用限制的硬件资源来分析医疗分流数据

Abstract: Triage notes, created at the start of a patient's hospital visit, contain a
wealth of information that can help medical staff and researchers understand
Emergency Department patient epidemiology and the degree of time-dependent
illness or injury. Unfortunately, applying modern Natural Language Processing
and Machine Learning techniques to analyse triage data faces some challenges:
Firstly, hospital data contains highly sensitive information that is subject to
privacy regulation thus need to be analysed on site; Secondly, most hospitals
and medical facilities lack the necessary hardware to fine-tune a Large
Language Model (LLM), much less training one from scratch; Lastly, to identify
the records of interest, expert inputs are needed to manually label the
datasets, which can be time-consuming and costly. We present in this paper a
pipeline that enables the classification of triage data using LLM and limited
compute resources. We first fine-tuned a pre-trained LLM with a classifier
using a small (2k) open sourced dataset on a GPU; and then further fine-tuned
the model with a hospital specific dataset of 1000 samples on a CPU. We
demonstrated that by carefully curating the datasets and leveraging existing
models and open sourced data, we can successfully classify triage data with
limited compute resources.

Method: 评估三个关键因素：1)领域特定继续预训练 2)使用自动生成样本的数据增强(生成式数据增强) 3)分类头的架构变体。使用BERT和RoBERTa等参数少于10亿的小型模型

Result: 数据增强能提高分类性能，但在增强数据集上继续预训练会引入噪声而非提升准确率。分类头修改带来的收益有限

Conclusion: 为资源受限环境下优化BERT模型提供了实用指导，并改进了短文本数据集情感分类策略

Abstract: Sentiment classification in short text datasets faces significant challenges
such as class imbalance, limited training samples, and the inherent
subjectivity of sentiment labels -- issues that are further intensified by the
limited context in short texts. These factors make it difficult to resolve
ambiguity and exacerbate data sparsity, hindering effective learning. In this
paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of small Transformer-based models (i.e.,
BERT and RoBERTa, with fewer than 1 billion parameters) for multi-label
sentiment classification, with a particular focus on short-text settings.
Specifically, we evaluated three key factors influencing model performance: (1)
continued domain-specific pre-training, (2) data augmentation using
automatically generated examples, specifically generative data augmentation,
and (3) architectural variations of the classification head. Our experiment
results show that data augmentation improves classification performance, while
continued pre-training on augmented datasets can introduce noise rather than
boost accuracy. Furthermore, we confirm that modifications to the
classification head yield only marginal benefits. These findings provide
practical guidance for optimizing BERT-based models in resource-constrained
settings and refining strategies for sentiment classification in short-text
datasets.

Abstract: In the era of conversational AI, generating accurate and contextually

address this fundamental design dilemma. Leveraging two publicly available

models, including a fine-tuned T5 variant, across both paradigms: Intent-First
Response Generation and Direct Response Generation. Evaluation metrics
encompass both linguistic quality and task success rates, revealing surprising
insights into the necessity or redundancy of explicit intent modelling. Our
findings challenge conventional assumptions in conversational AI pipelines,
offering actionable guidelines for designing more efficient and effective

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统类型学清单存在特征稀疏和静态快照的问题，需要一种能够捕捉语言间动态类型学关系的新方法。

Method: 通过训练单语语言模型，利用其预测熵来反映语言间的结构相似性：低熵表示高相似性，高熵表示较大差异，从而生成密集的非稀疏语言嵌入。

Result: 实证评估显示Entropy2Vec嵌入与既定类型学类别一致，在多语言NLP任务中（如LinguAlchemy框架）取得了竞争性性能。

Conclusion: Entropy2Vec提供了一种有效的方法来推导跨语言表示，能够适应不同时间范围且无缺失值，在类型学分析和多语言NLP任务中表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce Entropy2Vec, a novel framework for deriving cross-lingual
language representations by leveraging the entropy of monolingual language
models. Unlike traditional typological inventories that suffer from feature
sparsity and static snapshots, Entropy2Vec uses the inherent uncertainty in
language models to capture typological relationships between languages. By
training a language model on a single language, we hypothesize that the entropy
of its predictions reflects its structural similarity to other languages: Low
entropy indicates high similarity, while high entropy suggests greater
divergence. This approach yields dense, non-sparse language embeddings that are
adaptable to different timeframes and free from missing values. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that Entropy2Vec embeddings align with established
typological categories and achieved competitive performance in downstream
multilingual NLP tasks, such as those addressed by the LinguAlchemy framework.

Conclusion: ToM-SSI基准揭示了现有模型在复杂社交认知方面的关键差距，为未来研究指明了方向

Abstract: Most existing Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks for foundation models rely on
variations of the Sally-Anne test, offering only a very limited perspective on
ToM and neglecting the complexity of human social interactions. To address this
gap, we propose ToM-SSI: a new benchmark specifically designed to test ToM
capabilities in environments rich with social interactions and spatial
dynamics. While current ToM benchmarks are limited to text-only or dyadic
interactions, ToM-SSI is multimodal and includes group interactions of up to
four agents that communicate and move in situated environments. This unique
design allows us to study, for the first time, mixed cooperative-obstructive
settings and reasoning about multiple agents' mental state in parallel, thus
capturing a wider range of social cognition than existing benchmarks. Our
evaluations reveal that the current models' performance is still severely
limited, especially in these new tasks, highlighting critical gaps for future
research.

TL;DR: 提出ICR框架，通过迭代澄清和重写解决对话查询重写中多模糊表达的问题，在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端重写方法难以同时识别和重写查询中的多个模糊表达位置

Method: ICR框架，交替生成澄清问题和重写查询的迭代重写方案

Result: 在迭代过程中持续提升检索性能，在两个流行数据集上达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 基于澄清问题的迭代重写框架有效解决了多模糊表达问题，显著提升了对话查询重写性能

Abstract: Most previous work on Conversational Query Rewriting employs an end-to-end
rewriting paradigm. However, this approach is hindered by the issue of multiple
fuzzy expressions within the query, which complicates the simultaneous
identification and rewriting of multiple positions. To address this issue, we
propose a novel framework ICR (Iterative Clarification and Rewriting), an
iterative rewriting scheme that pivots on clarification questions. Within this
framework, the model alternates between generating clarification questions and
rewritten queries. The experimental results show that our ICR can continuously
improve retrieval performance in the clarification-rewriting iterative process,
thereby achieving state-of-the-art performance on two popular datasets.

TL;DR: TAXAL是一个三元融合框架，通过认知、功能和因果三个维度统一解释性方法，为代理式LLM在不同社会技术场景中提供可信的解释方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统解释性方法无法捕捉代理式LLM的推理路径、规划逻辑和系统影响，在高风险领域部署时存在透明度、偏见和不稳定性问题，需要新的解释性框架来增强信任和问责。

Method: 提出TAXAL（Triadic Alignment for eXplainability in Agentic LLMs）三元融合框架，整合认知维度（用户理解）、功能维度（实用效用）和因果维度（忠实推理），提供统一的角色敏感解释设计基础。

Result: 通过法律、教育、医疗和公共服务等领域的案例研究，展示了TAXAL框架在不同制度约束和利益相关者角色下的适应性，能够支持可信和情境敏感的LLM应用。

Conclusion: TAXAL将概念清晰性与设计模式和部署路径相结合，推进了解释性作为技术和社会技术实践的发展，为代理式AI时代的可信LLM应用提供支持。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed in high-risk
domains where opacity, bias, and instability undermine trust and
accountability. Traditional explainability methods, focused on surface outputs,
do not capture the reasoning pathways, planning logic, and systemic impacts of
agentic LLMs.
  We introduce TAXAL (Triadic Alignment for eXplainability in Agentic LLMs), a
triadic fusion framework that unites three complementary dimensions: cognitive
(user understanding), functional (practical utility), and causal (faithful
reasoning). TAXAL provides a unified, role-sensitive foundation for designing,
evaluating, and deploying explanations in diverse sociotechnical settings.
  Our analysis synthesizes existing methods, ranging from post-hoc attribution
and dialogic interfaces to explanation-aware prompting, and situates them
within the TAXAL triadic fusion model. We further demonstrate its applicability
through case studies in law, education, healthcare, and public services,
showing how explanation strategies adapt to institutional constraints and
stakeholder roles.
  By combining conceptual clarity with design patterns and deployment pathways,
TAXAL advances explainability as a technical and sociotechnical practice,
supporting trustworthy and context-sensitive LLM applications in the era of
agentic AI.

TL;DR: Hunyuan-MT-7B是首个开源多语言翻译模型，支持33种语言双向翻译，特别关注中文与少数民族语言/方言的翻译。Hunyuan-MT-Chimera-7B采用慢思考模式整合多个输出，性能优于传统CoT模型。在WMT2025任务中，31个语言对中30个排名第一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发支持多语言翻译特别是中文与少数民族语言/方言翻译的开源模型，解决多样化翻译场景需求，提升测试时模型性能。

Method: 采用整体训练流程：通用和MT导向的预训练建立基础能力，监督微调进行任务适配，通过强化学习和弱到强RL进行高级对齐。Chimera模型整合不同参数设置下的多个输出。

Result: Hunyuan-MT-7B和Chimera-7B显著优于同参数规模的翻译专用模型和大多数SOTA大模型，在WMT2025通用机器翻译任务中31个语言对中30个排名第一。

Conclusion: 该模型在多语言翻译特别是中文与少数民族语言/方言翻译方面表现出色，展现了跨多样语言谱系的鲁棒性，包括高资源和低资源语言。

Abstract: In this report, we introduce Hunyuan-MT-7B, our first open-source
multilingual translation model, which supports bidirectional translation across
33 major languages and places a special emphasis on translation between
Mandarin and several ethnic minority languages as well as dialects.
Furthermore, to serve and address diverse translation scenarios and enhance
model performance at test time, we introduce Hunyuan-MT-Chimera-7B, a
translation model inspired by the slow thinking mode. This model integrates
multiple outputs generated by the Hunyuan-MT-7B model under varying parameter
settings, thereby achieving performance superior to that of conventional
slow-thinking models based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT). The development of our
models follows a holistic training process specifically engineered for
multilingual translation, which begins with general and MT-oriented
pre-training to build foundational capabilities, proceeds to Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) for task-specific adaptation, and culminates in advanced
alignment through Reinforcement Learning (RL) and weak-to-strong RL. Through
comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate that both Hunyuan-MT-7B and
Hunyuan-MT-Chimera-7B significantly outperform all translation-specific models
of comparable parameter size and most of the SOTA large models, particularly on
the task of translation between Mandarin and minority languages as well as
dialects. In the WMT2025 shared task (General Machine Translation), our models
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, ranking first in 30 out of 31
language pairs. This result highlights the robustness of our models across a
diverse linguistic spectrum, encompassing high-resource languages such as
Chinese, English, and Japanese, as well as low-resource languages including
Czech, Marathi, Estonian, and Icelandic.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个时间序列自然语言描述的标准化评测框架，通过统一四个数据集来评测13种先进模型在识别、区分和生成任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有时间序列基础模型评估中存在的两个问题：缺乏直接可比较性，以及评估过于广泛而无法准确识别模型的具体强项。

Method: 形式化了3种测试时间序列自然语言描述能力的任务：识别（真伪问答）、区分（多选题）和生成（开放式描述），并统一了4个数据集进行模型比较。

Result: 识别到：纯语言模型表现较差，需要时间序列特定架构；视觉-语言模型表现良好；预训练多模态时间序语言模型超过了大语言模型，但仍有提升空间；所有模型在稳健性测试中都显示出脆弱性。

Conclusion: 该框架为时间序推理系统提供了标准化的评估方法，显示了当前模型在时间序自然语言描述任务上的优势和不足，为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Many recent studies have proposed general-purpose foundation models designed
for a variety of time series analysis tasks. While several established datasets
already exist for evaluating these models, previous works frequently introduce
their models in conjunction with new datasets, limiting opportunities for
direct, independent comparisons and obscuring insights into the relative
strengths of different methods. Additionally, prior evaluations often cover
numerous tasks simultaneously, assessing a broad range of model abilities
without clearly pinpointing which capabilities contribute to overall
performance. To address these gaps, we formalize and evaluate 3 tasks that test
a model's ability to describe time series using generic natural language: (1)
recognition (True/False question-answering), (2) differentiation (multiple
choice question-answering), and (3) generation (open-ended natural language
description). We then unify 4 recent datasets to enable head-to-head model
comparisons on each task. Experimentally, in evaluating 13 state-of-the-art
language, vision--language, and time series--language models, we find that (1)
popular language-only methods largely underperform, indicating a need for time
series-specific architectures, (2) VLMs are quite successful, as expected,
identifying the value of vision models for these tasks and (3) pretrained
multimodal time series--language models successfully outperform LLMs, but still
have significant room for improvement. We also find that all approaches exhibit
clear fragility in a range of robustness tests. Overall, our benchmark provides
a standardized evaluation on a task necessary for time series reasoning
systems.

TL;DR: HoPE是一种基于双曲几何的新型位置编码方法，通过洛伦兹变换解决RoPE的振荡问题，在长序列建模中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有位置编码方法（绝对位置编码、Alibi、RoPE）在超长序列建模中存在外推困难、性能下降和注意力模式振荡等问题，需要新的几何框架来解决这些限制

Method: 从双曲几何中的洛伦兹变换获得灵感，提出双曲旋转位置编码（HoPE），使用双曲函数在token表示上实现洛伦兹旋转，理论证明RoPE是其特例

Result: HoPE从根本上解决了RoPE的振荡问题，强制注意力权重随token距离增加而单调衰减，在多个扩展序列基准测试中持续超越现有位置编码方法

Conclusion: HoPE通过双曲几何框架显著提升了长距离依赖关系的表示和泛化能力，为长序列建模提供了更有效的位置编码解决方案

Abstract: Positional encoding mechanisms enable Transformers to model sequential
structure and long-range dependencies in text. While absolute positional
encodings struggle with extrapolation to longer sequences due to fixed
positional representations, and relative approaches like Alibi exhibit
performance degradation on extremely long contexts, the widely-used Rotary
Positional Encoding (RoPE) introduces oscillatory attention patterns that
hinder stable long-distance dependency modelling. We address these limitations
through a geometric reformulation of positional encoding. Drawing inspiration
from Lorentz transformations in hyperbolic geometry, we propose Hyperbolic
Rotary Positional Encoding (HoPE), which leverages hyperbolic functions to
implement Lorentz rotations on token representations. Theoretical analysis
demonstrates that RoPE is a special case of our generalized formulation. HoPE
fundamentally resolves RoPE's slation issues by enforcing monotonic decay of
attention weights with increasing token distances. Extensive experimental
results, including perplexity evaluations under several extended sequence
benchmarks, show that HoPE consistently exceeds existing positional encoding
methods. These findings underscore HoPE's enhanced capacity for representing
and generalizing long-range dependencies. Data and code will be available.

TL;DR: 通过集成监督微调和直接偏好优化的方法，教会模型根据问题难度动态调整思维深度，在简单问题上减少冗余输出同时保持复杂问题的精确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决链式思维推理在简单问题上产生不必要冗长输出的问题，让模型能够根据问题难度动态调整思考深度。

Method: 使用经过精心筛选的数据进行后训练，数据包含与问题难度成正比的链式思维追踪。采用监督微调(SFT)捕捉推理长度和格式模式，通过直接偏好优化(DPO)保持推理准确性。

Result: 模型学会了"按比例思考"，在简单问题上最小化推理，在复杂问题上保持深度推理。结合SFT和DPO能够减少推理长度同时维持或提高性能。

Conclusion: 无需修改模型架构，仅通过合适的数据训练就可以让模型获得动态推理路径能力，实现难度感知的推理调节。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought reasoning, while powerful, can produce unnecessarily verbose
output for simpler problems. We present a framework for difficulty-aware
reasoning that teaches models to dynamically adjust reasoning depth based on
problem complexity. Remarkably, we show that models can be endowed with such
dynamic inference pathways without any architectural modifications; we simply
post-train on data that is carefully curated to include chain-of-thought traces
that are proportional in length to problem difficulty. Our analysis reveals
that post-training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) primarily captures patterns
like reasoning length and format, while direct preference optimization (DPO)
preserves reasoning accuracy, with their combination reducing length and
maintaining or improving performance. Both quantitative metrics and qualitative
assessments confirm that models can learn to "think proportionally", reasoning
minimally on simple problems while maintaining depth for complex ones.

Motivation: 预训练语言模型虽然成功但容易受到虚假概念相关性的影响，损害模型的鲁棒性和公平性，需要一种方法来系统性地解耦和抑制概念捷径。

Method: 使用内容提取器和反转网络提取概念无关表示，然后通过可控去偏模块进行对比学习，精细调整剩余概念线索的影响。

Result: 在IMDB和Yelp数据集上，使用三种预训练架构，CURE在IMDB上F1分数绝对提升10个百分点，Yelp上提升2个百分点，计算开销极小。

Conclusion: CURE为对抗概念偏见提供了一个灵活的无监督蓝图，为构建更可靠和公平的语言理解系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models have achieved remarkable success across diverse
applications but remain susceptible to spurious, concept-driven correlations
that impair robustness and fairness. In this work, we introduce CURE, a novel
and lightweight framework that systematically disentangles and suppresses
conceptual shortcuts while preserving essential content information. Our method
first extracts concept-irrelevant representations via a dedicated content
extractor reinforced by a reversal network, ensuring minimal loss of
task-relevant information. A subsequent controllable debiasing module employs
contrastive learning to finely adjust the influence of residual conceptual
cues, enabling the model to either diminish harmful biases or harness
beneficial correlations as appropriate for the target task. Evaluated on the
IMDB and Yelp datasets using three pre-trained architectures, CURE achieves an
absolute improvement of +10 points in F1 score on IMDB and +2 points on Yelp,
while introducing minimal computational overhead. Our approach establishes a
flexible, unsupervised blueprint for combating conceptual biases, paving the
way for more reliable and fair language understanding systems.

Motivation: 检验均匀信息密度假设，探索语言产出中的可变性如何被用来维持一致的信息传输速率

Method: 分析大规模对话语料库，使用机器学习和神经语言模型来精炼信息密度估计，比较不同测量方法

Result: 重现了信息密度与that使用的关系，发现基于动词子类化概率的传统测量包含大量词汇特异性，而上下文词向量估计能解释更多变异

Conclusion: 上下文化的信息密度测量方法更能够揭示补语连接词使用模式的真实特征

Abstract: Speakers often have multiple ways to express the same meaning. The Uniform
Information Density (UID) hypothesis suggests that speakers exploit this
variability to maintain a consistent rate of information transmission during
language production. Building on prior work linking UID to syntactic reduction,
we revisit the finding that the optional complementizer $\textit{that}$in
English complement clauses is more likely to be omitted when the clause has low
information density (i.e., more predictable). We advance this line of research
by analyzing a large-scale, contemporary conversational corpus and using
machine learning and neural language models to refine estimates of information
density. Our results replicated the established relationship between
information density and $\textit{that}$-mentioning. However, we found that
previous measures of information density based on matrix verbs'
subcategorization probability capture substantial idiosyncratic lexical
variation. By contrast, estimates derived from contextual word embeddings
account for additional variance in patterns of complementizer usage.

Motivation: 系统性地探索线性复杂度序列模型中衰减机制的设计空间，以提高模型性能和效果。

Method: 从四个维度分析衰减机制：参数化策略、参数共享、衰减粒度和位置编码兼容性，通过多样化语言建模任务进行实验。

Result: 发现1）参数化策略需精心设计，有效配置在特定参数范围内；2）参数共享不能随意使用，容易导致性能下降；3）向量衰减通常优于标量衰减，但在某些情况下反过来；4）RoPE对大部分线性注意力机制无显著改善。

Conclusion: 衰减机制的设计需细致考虑多个因素，特定的参数范围和策略选择对模型性能有重要影响，应遵循实验验证的最佳实践。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the decay mechanisms
inherent in linear complexity sequence models. We systematically delineate the
design space of decay mechanisms across four pivotal dimensions:
parameterization strategy, which refers to the computational methodology for
decay; parameter sharing, which involves the utilization of supplementary
parameters for decay computation; decay granularity, comparing scalar versus
vector-based decay; and compatibility with relative positional encoding
methods, such as Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). Through an extensive series
of experiments conducted on diverse language modeling tasks, we uncovered
several critical insights. Firstly, the design of the parameterization strategy
for decay requires meticulous consideration. Our findings indicate that
effective configurations are typically confined to a specific range of
parameters. Secondly, parameter sharing cannot be used arbitrarily, as it may
cause decay values to be too large or too small, thereby significantly
impacting performance. Thirdly, under identical parameterization strategies,
scalar decay generally underperforms compared to its vector-based counterpart.
However, in certain scenarios with alternative parameterization strategies,
scalar decay may unexpectedly surpass vector decay in efficacy. Lastly, our
analysis reveals that RoPE, a commonly employed relative positional encoding
method, typically fails to provide tangible benefits to the majority of linear
attention mechanisms.

Motivation: 传统性能评估方法无法揭示语言模型如何在预训练中获得具体概念和能力，需要更细粒度地分析表征学习过程

Method: 使用稀疏交叉编码器在不同检查点之间发现对齐特征，并提出新的RelIE指标来追踪特征在任务性能中的因果重要性

Result: 交叉编码器能够检测到特征的出现、维护和中断，揭示了语言能力的演化过程

Conclusion: 该方法不依赖于特定网络结构，具有良好的扩展性，为预训练过程中的表征学习提供了更可解释和细粒度的分析方法

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) learn non-trivial abstractions during
pretraining, like detecting irregular plural noun subjects. However, it is not
well understood when and how specific linguistic abilities emerge as
traditional evaluation methods such as benchmarking fail to reveal how models
acquire concepts and capabilities. To bridge this gap and better understand
model training at the concept level, we use sparse crosscoders to discover and
align features across model checkpoints. Using this approach, we track the
evolution of linguistic features during pretraining. We train crosscoders
between open-sourced checkpoint triplets with significant performance and
representation shifts, and introduce a novel metric, Relative Indirect Effects
(RelIE), to trace training stages at which individual features become causally
important for task performance. We show that crosscoders can detect feature
emergence, maintenance, and discontinuation during pretraining. Our approach is
architecture-agnostic and scalable, offering a promising path toward more
interpretable and fine-grained analysis of representation learning throughout
pretraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信任和感知安全性对自动驾驶车辆的公众接受度至关重要，需要研究乘客在自动驾驶过程中的风险感知特征。

Method: 使用32名参与者进行驾驶渣拟器实验，测量连续主观舒适度、车辆运动、面部表情、皮电导、心率和眼动跟踪。比较两种驾驶风格和行人交互情况。

Result: 动态驾驶风格导致更强的不舒适感；行人交互使动态驾驶时的不舒适感增加一倍；面部表情识别对风险感知评估不可靠；神经网络模型能够准确预测感知风险。

Conclusion: 车辆运动和皮电导数据可以对象地评估自动驾驶中的感知风险，减少主观偏差，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Trust and perceived safety play a crucial role in the public acceptance of
automated vehicles. To understand perceived risk, an experiment was conducted
using a driving simulator under two automated driving styles and optionally
introducing a crossing pedestrian. Data was collected from 32 participants,
consisting of continuous subjective comfort ratings, motion, webcam footage for
facial expression, skin conductance, heart rate, and eye tracking. The
continuous subjective perceived risk ratings showed significant discomfort
associated with perceived risk during cornering and braking followed by relief
or even positive comfort on continuing the ride. The dynamic driving style
induced a stronger discomfort as compared to the calm driving style. The
crossing pedestrian did not affect discomfort with the calm driving style but
doubled the comfort decrement with the dynamic driving style. This illustrates
the importance of consequences of critical interactions in risk perception.
Facial expression was successfully analyzed for 24 participants but most
(15/24) did not show any detectable facial reaction to the critical event.
Among the 9 participants who did, 8 showed a Happy expression, and only 4
showed a Surprise expression. Fear was never dominant. This indicates that
facial expression recognition is not a reliable method for assessing perceived
risk in automated vehicles. To predict perceived risk a neural network model
was implemented using vehicle motion and skin conductance. The model correlated
well with reported perceived risk, demonstrating its potential for objective
perceived risk assessment in automated vehicles, reducing subjective bias and
highlighting areas for future research.

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在处理复杂用户提示时经常出现属性绑定、否定和组合关系方面的失败，导致用户意图与生成结果不匹配。

Method: 通过强化学习训练思维链重写器，使用专门的AlignEvaluator奖励模型提供细粒度反馈，该奖励模型基于24个关键点的系统分类法构建。

Result: 在HunyuanImage 2.1模型上的广泛实验表明，PromptEnhancer在广泛的语义和组合挑战中显著改善了图像-文本对齐效果。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了文本到图像模型中的提示词理解问题，并引入了新的人类偏好基准来促进未来研究。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in generating high-fidelity images. However, these
models often struggle to faithfully render complex user prompts, particularly
in aspects like attribute binding, negation, and compositional relationships.
This leads to a significant mismatch between user intent and the generated
output. To address this challenge, we introduce PromptEnhancer, a novel and
universal prompt rewriting framework that enhances any pretrained T2I model
without requiring modifications to its weights. Unlike prior methods that rely
on model-specific fine-tuning or implicit reward signals like image-reward
scores, our framework decouples the rewriter from the generator. We achieve
this by training a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rewriter through reinforcement
learning, guided by a dedicated reward model we term the AlignEvaluator. The
AlignEvaluator is trained to provide explicit and fine-grained feedback based
on a systematic taxonomy of 24 key points, which are derived from a
comprehensive analysis of common T2I failure modes. By optimizing the CoT
rewriter to maximize the reward from our AlignEvaluator, our framework learns
to generate prompts that are more precisely interpreted by T2I models.
Extensive experiments on the HunyuanImage 2.1 model demonstrate that
PromptEnhancer significantly improves image-text alignment across a wide range
of semantic and compositional challenges. Furthermore, we introduce a new,
high-quality human preference benchmark to facilitate future research in this
direction.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in unified image generation and editing. However, many prominent
open-source models prioritize scaling model parameters over optimizing training
strategies, limiting their efficiency and performance. In this work, we present
UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext, a 2B-parameter DiT model based on SD3.5-Medium, which
achieves state-of-the-art image generation and editing while extending
seamlessly into a unified multimodal framework. Our approach begins with
architectural modifications to SD3.5-Medium and large-scale pre-training on
high-quality data, enabling joint text-to-image generation and editing
capabilities. To enhance instruction following and editing consistency, we
propose a novel Progressive Dual-Task Reinforcement strategy (PDTR), which
effectively strengthens both tasks in a staged manner. We empirically validate
that the reinforcement phases for different tasks are mutually beneficial and
do not induce negative interference. After pre-training and reinforcement
strategies, UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext demonstrates stronger image generation and
editing capabilities than models with significantly larger generation
parameters-including BAGEL (7B) and Flux-Kontext (12B). Furthermore, following
the MetaQuery, we connect the UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext and Qwen2.5-VL-7B via a
connector and perform joint training to launch a unified multimodal model
UniPic2-Metaquery. UniPic2-Metaquery integrates understanding, generation, and
editing, achieving top-tier performance across diverse tasks with a simple and
scalable training paradigm. This consistently validates the effectiveness and
generalizability of our proposed training paradigm, which we formalize as
Skywork UniPic 2.0.

Result: 实现了实时变形预览(0.01秒)和高效修复(0.3秒)，在512x512分辨率下显著优于需要数分钟编辑时间的方法，且可作为通用适配器兼容任何修复模型。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持实时性能的同时实现了卓越的视觉质量和精确控制，为拖拽式图像编辑提供了高效通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Drag-based image editing has emerged as a powerful paradigm for intuitive
image manipulation. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on
manipulating the latent space of generative models, leading to limited
precision, delayed feedback, and model-specific constraints. Accordingly, we
present Inpaint4Drag, a novel framework that decomposes drag-based editing into
pixel-space bidirectional warping and image inpainting. Inspired by elastic
object deformation in the physical world, we treat image regions as deformable
materials that maintain natural shape under user manipulation. Our method
achieves real-time warping previews (0.01s) and efficient inpainting (0.3s) at
512x512 resolution, significantly improving the interaction experience compared
to existing methods that require minutes per edit. By transforming drag inputs
directly into standard inpainting formats, our approach serves as a universal
adapter for any inpainting model without architecture modification,
automatically inheriting all future improvements in inpainting technology.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior visual
quality and precise control while maintaining real-time performance. Project

*Jin Ma,Mohammed Aldeen,Christopher Salas,Feng Luo,Mashrur Chowdhury,Mert Pesé,Long Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DISPATCH是首个基于扩散模型的物体检测防御框架，采用"再生与修正"策略，通过扩散模型生成良性图像来消除对抗补丁攻击效果，无需事先了解攻击补丁信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的物体检测器容易受到对抗补丁攻击，可能导致严重后果。当前防御方法需要针对特定攻击设计，缺乏通用性和对自适应攻击的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用扩散模型对整个图像进行再生，使其与良性数据对齐，然后通过修正过程识别并替换对抗区域为再生后的良性对应部分。该方法与攻击类型无关，无需先验知识。

Result: 在多种检测器和攻击上的实验表明，DISPATCH在隐藏攻击上达到89.3%的mAP.5最佳得分，在非目标创建攻击上将攻击成功率降低至24.8%，且对自适应攻击保持强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DISPATCH提供了一个实用可靠的物体检测系统防御方案，具有攻击无关性、通用性和对自适应攻击的强鲁棒性，优于现有最先进防御方法。

Abstract: Object detection is fundamental to various real-world applications, such as
security monitoring and surveillance video analysis. Despite their
advancements, state-of-theart object detectors are still vulnerable to
adversarial patch attacks, which can be easily applied to real-world objects to
either conceal actual items or create non-existent ones, leading to severe
consequences. Given the current diversity of adversarial patch attacks and
potential unknown threats, an ideal defense method should be effective,
generalizable, and robust against adaptive attacks. In this work, we introduce
DISPATCH, the first diffusion-based defense framework for object detection.
Unlike previous works that aim to "detect and remove" adversarial patches,
DISPATCH adopts a "regenerate and rectify" strategy, leveraging generative
models to disarm attack effects while preserving the integrity of the input
image. Specifically, we utilize the in-distribution generative power of
diffusion models to regenerate the entire image, aligning it with benign data.
A rectification process is then employed to identify and replace adversarial
regions with their regenerated benign counterparts. DISPATCH is attack-agnostic
and requires no prior knowledge of the existing patches. Extensive experiments
across multiple detectors and attacks demonstrate that DISPATCH consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art defenses on both hiding attacks and creating
attacks, achieving the best overall mAP.5 score of 89.3% on hiding attacks, and
lowering the attack success rate to 24.8% on untargeted creating attacks.
Moreover, it maintains strong robustness against adaptive attacks, making it a
practical and reliable defense for object detection systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WATCH是一个统一的框架，用于从单目视频中重建全局人体运动，通过创新的航向角分解技术和相机轨迹整合机制，解决了相机方向信息利用不足和相机平移线索整合困难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从野外单目视频重建全局人体运动在VR、图形和机器人应用中需求日益增长，但面临深度模糊、运动模糊以及相机与人体运动纠缠等挑战。现有方法在利用相机方向信息和整合相机平移线索方面存在不足。

Method: 提出WATCH框架，包含：1）分析性航向角分解技术，比现有几何方法更高效和可扩展；2）受世界模型启发的相机轨迹整合机制，有效利用相机平移信息。

Result: 在野外基准测试中，WATCH在端到端轨迹重建方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该工作证明了联合建模相机-人体运动关系的有效性，并为解决相机平移整合这一长期挑战提供了新见解。

Abstract: Global human motion reconstruction from in-the-wild monocular videos is
increasingly demanded across VR, graphics, and robotics applications, yet
requires accurate mapping of human poses from camera to world coordinates-a
task challenged by depth ambiguity, motion ambiguity, and the entanglement
between camera and human movements. While human-motion-centric approaches excel
in preserving motion details and physical plausibility, they suffer from two
critical limitations: insufficient exploitation of camera orientation
information and ineffective integration of camera translation cues. We present
WATCH (World-aware Allied Trajectory and pose reconstruction for Camera and
Human), a unified framework addressing both challenges. Our approach introduces
an analytical heading angle decomposition technique that offers superior
efficiency and extensibility compared to existing geometric methods.
Additionally, we design a camera trajectory integration mechanism inspired by
world models, providing an effective pathway for leveraging camera translation
information beyond naive hard-decoding approaches. Through experiments on
in-the-wild benchmarks, WATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance in
end-to-end trajectory reconstruction. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness
of jointly modeling camera-human motion relationships and offers new insights
for addressing the long-standing challenge of camera translation integration in
global human motion reconstruction. The code will be available publicly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有端到端模型的两个局限性：(1)仅对文本应用时间戳监督，将所有视频帧同等对待；(2)从固定大小的视频块中检索字幕，忽略了场景转换

Method: 提出Saliency-aware Video Reweighting（将时间戳注释转换为基于sigmoid的帧重要性权重）和Semantic-based Adaptive Caption Retrieval（通过帧相似性分割视频以捕捉场景转换并改进字幕检索）

Result: 在YouCook2和ViTT数据集上取得了最先进的结果

Conclusion: 联合改进视频加权和检索对密集视频描述有益，Sali4Vid框架简单有效

Abstract: Dense video captioning aims to temporally localize events in video and
generate captions for each event. While recent works propose end-to-end models,
they suffer from two limitations: (1) applying timestamp supervision only to
text while treating all video frames equally, and (2) retrieving captions from
fixed-size video chunks, overlooking scene transitions. To address these, we
propose Sali4Vid, a simple yet effective saliency-aware framework. We introduce
Saliency-aware Video Reweighting, which converts timestamp annotations into
sigmoid-based frame importance weights, and Semantic-based Adaptive Caption
Retrieval, which segments videos by frame similarity to capture scene
transitions and improve caption retrieval. Sali4Vid achieves state-of-the-art
results on YouCook2 and ViTT, demonstrating the benefit of jointly improving
video weighting and retrieval for dense video captioning

Abstract: Traffic congestion and violations pose significant challenges for urban
mobility and road safety. Traditional traffic monitoring systems, such as fixed
cameras and sensor-based methods, are often constrained by limited coverage,
low adaptability, and poor scalability. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces an advanced unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based traffic surveillance
system capable of accurate vehicle detection, classification, tracking, and
behavioral analysis in real-world, unconstrained urban environments. The system
leverages multi-scale and multi-angle template matching, Kalman filtering, and
homography-based calibration to process aerial video data collected from
altitudes of approximately 200 meters. A case study in urban area demonstrates
robust performance, achieving a detection precision of 91.8%, an F1-score of
90.5%, and tracking metrics (MOTA/MOTP) of 92.1% and 93.7%, respectively.
Beyond precise detection, the system classifies five vehicle types and
automatically detects critical traffic violations, including unsafe lane
changes, illegal double parking, and crosswalk obstructions, through the fusion
of geofencing, motion filtering, and trajectory deviation analysis. The
integrated analytics module supports origin-destination tracking, vehicle count
visualization, inter-class correlation analysis, and heatmap-based congestion
modeling. Additionally, the system enables entry-exit trajectory profiling,
vehicle density estimation across road segments, and movement direction
logging, supporting comprehensive multi-scale urban mobility analytics.
Experimental results confirms the system's scalability, accuracy, and practical
relevance, highlighting its potential as an enforcement-aware,
infrastructure-independent traffic monitoring solution for next-generation
smart cities.

TL;DR: VCMamba是一个结合CNN局部特征提取能力和Mamba SSM全局建模能力的混合视觉骨干网络，在ImageNet和ADE20K上取得了优异的性能表现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决ViT和SSM在局部特征提取方面的不足，以及CNN在全局建模方面的局限，需要结合两者的优势来构建更高效的视觉骨干网络

Method: 采用卷积stem和分层结构，早期阶段使用卷积块提取局部特征，后期阶段使用多方向Mamba块建模长距离依赖和全局上下文，保持线性复杂度

Result: VCMamba-B在ImageNet-1K上达到82.6% top-1准确率，参数比PlainMamba-L3少37%；在ADE20K上获得47.1 mIoU，参数比EfficientFormer-L7少62%

Conclusion: VCMamba成功整合了CNN和Mamba SSM的优势，在保持线性复杂度的同时实现了优异的性能，为视觉骨干网络设计提供了新思路

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) and State Space Models (SSMs)
have challenged the dominance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in
computer vision. ViTs excel at capturing global context, and SSMs like Mamba
offer linear complexity for long sequences, yet they do not capture
fine-grained local features as effectively as CNNs. Conversely, CNNs possess
strong inductive biases for local features but lack the global reasoning
capabilities of transformers and Mamba. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\textit{VCMamba}, a novel vision backbone that integrates the strengths of CNNs
and multi-directional Mamba SSMs. VCMamba employs a convolutional stem and a
hierarchical structure with convolutional blocks in its early stages to extract
rich local features. These convolutional blocks are then processed by later
stages incorporating multi-directional Mamba blocks designed to efficiently
model long-range dependencies and global context. This hybrid design allows for
superior feature representation while maintaining linear complexity with
respect to image resolution. We demonstrate VCMamba's effectiveness through
extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K classification and ADE20K semantic
segmentation. Our VCMamba-B achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K,
surpassing PlainMamba-L3 by 0.3% with 37% fewer parameters, and outperforming
Vision GNN-B by 0.3% with 64% fewer parameters. Furthermore, VCMamba-B obtains
47.1 mIoU on ADE20K, exceeding EfficientFormer-L7 by 2.0 mIoU while utilizing
62% fewer parameters. Code is available at

TL;DR: 一种多段落长度标注指南的语义分割方法，通过工人-监督者多代理精细化架构，免训练实现指南一致的分割结果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实际应用中语义分割需要遵循复杂长文本标注指南的挑战，传统方法需要费用昂贵的任务特定重训练

Method: 多代理免训练框架，采用工人-监督者精细化架构，工人负责分割，监督者根据检索到的指南评估，轻量级强化学习停止策略控制循环终止

Result: 在Waymo和ReasonSeg数据集上显著超过最先进基线方法，展现出强大的汇总能力和指令遵循性

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效处理复杂长文本标注指南的语义分割任务，免去费用昂贵的重训练，具有良好的通用性

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in real-world applications often requires not only
accurate masks but also strict adherence to textual labeling guidelines. These
guidelines are typically complex and long, and both human and automated
labeling often fail to follow them faithfully. Traditional approaches depend on
expensive task-specific retraining that must be repeated as the guidelines
evolve. Although recent open-vocabulary segmentation methods excel with simple
prompts, they often fail when confronted with sets of paragraph-length
guidelines that specify intricate segmentation rules. To address this, we
introduce a multi-agent, training-free framework that coordinates
general-purpose vision-language models within an iterative Worker-Supervisor
refinement architecture. The Worker performs the segmentation, the Supervisor
critiques it against the retrieved guidelines, and a lightweight reinforcement
learning stop policy decides when to terminate the loop, ensuring
guideline-consistent masks while balancing resource use. Evaluated on the Waymo
and ReasonSeg datasets, our method notably outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, demonstrating strong generalization and instruction adherence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出两种技术来解决3D物体检测中不同传感器配置的域适应问题：下游微调和部分层微调，通过在同一地理区域收集的多传感器配置数据集验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同车辆平台部署不同的传感器配置会导致点云分布变化，当在一个配置上训练的模型应用到另一个配置时会出现性能下降，而现有工作主要关注环境域差距和单一LiDAR内的密度变化，不同传感器配置的域差距尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出两种技术：1）下游微调（在多数据集训练后进行数据集特定的微调）2）部分层微调（仅更新部分层以提高跨配置泛化能力），使用同一地理区域收集的多个传感器配置配对数据集进行验证。

Result: 实验表明，联合训练结合下游微调和部分层微调始终优于每种配置的简单联合训练，为3D物体检测模型适应多样化车辆平台提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Conclusion: 该研究为解决不同传感器配置间的域适应问题提供了有效方法，通过下游微调和部分层微调技术显著提升了模型在跨配置场景下的性能表现。

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving have underscored the importance of
accurate 3D object detection, with LiDAR playing a central role due to its
robustness under diverse visibility conditions. However, different vehicle
platforms often deploy distinct sensor configurations, causing performance
degradation when models trained on one configuration are applied to another
because of shifts in the point cloud distribution. Prior work on multi-dataset
training and domain adaptation for 3D object detection has largely addressed
environmental domain gaps and density variation within a single LiDAR; in
contrast, the domain gap for different sensor configurations remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we address domain adaptation across different sensor
configurations in 3D object detection. We propose two techniques: Downstream
Fine-tuning (dataset-specific fine-tuning after multi-dataset training) and
Partial Layer Fine-tuning (updating only a subset of layers to improve
cross-configuration generalization). Using paired datasets collected in the
same geographic region with multiple sensor configurations, we show that joint
training with Downstream Fine-tuning and Partial Layer Fine-tuning consistently
outperforms naive joint training for each configuration. Our findings provide a
practical and scalable solution for adapting 3D object detection models to the
diverse vehicle platforms.

Motivation: 遥感图像常被云层遮蓝，影响数据完整性。需要同时处理短程空间冗余和长程大气相似性问题

Method: 设计CD-Mamba混合模型，集成卷积操作和Mamba状态空间模型，同时抓取像素级细节和片段级依赖关系

Result: 实验验证CD-Mamba有效性，表现超过现有方法

Conclusion: 混合模型能够同时处理不同空间尺度的依赖关系，提高云层检测准确性

Abstract: Remote sensing images are frequently obscured by cloud cover, posing
significant challenges to data integrity and reliability. Effective cloud
detection requires addressing both short-range spatial redundancies and
long-range atmospheric similarities among cloud patches. Convolutional neural
networks are effective at capturing local spatial dependencies, while Mamba has
strong capabilities in modeling long-range dependencies. To fully leverage both
local spatial relations and long-range dependencies, we propose CD-Mamba, a
hybrid model that integrates convolution and Mamba's state-space modeling into
a unified cloud detection network. CD-Mamba is designed to comprehensively
capture pixelwise textural details and long term patchwise dependencies for
cloud detection. This design enables CD-Mamba to manage both pixel-wise
interactions and extensive patch-wise dependencies simultaneously, improving
detection accuracy across diverse spatial scales. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of CD-Mamba and demonstrate its superior performance
over existing methods.

TL;DR: 提出Task Consistency Training (TCT)框架，通过多任务一致性约束和不确定性加权损失解决医学图像分割中的类别不平衡问题，无需额外模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割中获取所有类别的完整标注成本高昂，部分标注数据集存在严重类别不平衡问题，现有方法需要额外模型且易受标签噪声影响。

Method: TCT框架包含主分割头和多个辅助任务头，通过一致性约束利用未标注解剖结构，采用过滤策略排除低一致性数据，并使用统一辅助不确定性加权损失(UAUWL)。

Result: 在8个腹部数据集上的广泛实验证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: TCT框架能有效解决类别不平衡问题，提升医学图像分割性能，且无需额外模型。

Abstract: Versatile medical image segmentation (VMIS) targets the segmentation of
multiple classes, while obtaining full annotations for all classes is often
impractical due to the time and labor required. Leveraging partially labeled
datasets (PLDs) presents a promising alternative; however, current VMIS
approaches face significant class imbalance due to the unequal category
distribution in PLDs. Existing methods attempt to address this by generating
pseudo-full labels. Nevertheless, these typically require additional models and
often result in potential performance degradation from label noise. In this
work, we introduce a Task Consistency Training (TCT) framework to address class
imbalance without requiring extra models. TCT includes a backbone network with
a main segmentation head (MSH) for multi-channel predictions and multiple
auxiliary task heads (ATHs) for task-specific predictions. By enforcing a
consistency constraint between the MSH and ATH predictions, TCT effectively
utilizes unlabeled anatomical structures. To avoid error propagation from
low-consistency, potentially noisy data, we propose a filtering strategy to
exclude such data. Additionally, we introduce a unified auxiliary
uncertainty-weighted loss (UAUWL) to mitigate segmentation quality declines
caused by the dominance of specific tasks. Extensive experiments on eight
abdominal datasets from diverse clinical sites demonstrate our approach's
effectiveness.

Motivation: 现有的视觉基础模型（如SAM和SAM2）在视觉模糊性高的恶劣天气条件下表现不佳，缺乏不确定性量化能力，而自动驾驶等安全关键应用需要更高的可靠性。

Method: 1. 为SAM2设计多步微调程序，将不确定性指标直接融入损失函数；2. 将医学影像中的不确定性感知适配器（UAT）适配到驾驶场景中。

Result: 在CamVid、BDD100K和GTA驾驶数据集上的实验表明，UAT-SAM在极端天气下优于标准SAM，而带有不确定性感知损失的SAM2在多样化驾驶场景中实现了性能提升。

Conclusion: 显式的不确定性建模对于在挑战性环境中进行安全关键自动驾驶具有重要价值，不确定性感知方法能显著提升分割模型在恶劣条件下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision foundation models, such as the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) and its successor SAM2, have achieved state-of-the-art performance
on general image segmentation benchmarks. However, these models struggle in
adverse weather conditions where visual ambiguity is high, largely due to their
lack of uncertainty quantification. Inspired by progress in medical imaging,
where uncertainty-aware training has improved reliability in ambiguous cases,
we investigate two approaches to enhance segmentation robustness for autonomous
driving. First, we introduce a multi-step finetuning procedure for SAM2 that
incorporates uncertainty metrics directly into the loss function, improving
overall scene recognition. Second, we adapt the Uncertainty-Aware Adapter
(UAT), originally designed for medical image segmentation, to driving contexts.
We evaluate both methods on CamVid, BDD100K, and GTA driving datasets.
Experiments show that UAT-SAM outperforms standard SAM in extreme weather,
while SAM2 with uncertainty-aware loss achieves improved performance across
diverse driving scenes. These findings underscore the value of explicit
uncertainty modeling for safety-critical autonomous driving in challenging
environments.

outperforms state-of-the-art models for event detection and activity
classification while running directly on the smartwatch, achieving 9.3 ms

TL;DR: MCANet是一个多标签分类框架，通过多尺度特征学习和类别特定注意力机制，显著提升了飓风后无人机图像中的多类损害检测性能，在RescueNet数据集上达到91.75%的mAP。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的CNN方法难以捕捉多尺度空间特征，且难以区分视觉相似或共现的损害类型，这限制了飓风后损害评估的准确性和效率。

Method: 提出MCANet框架：1）使用Res2Net分层骨干网络丰富多尺度空间上下文；2）多头部类别特定残差注意力模块，每个注意力分支关注不同空间粒度；3）平衡局部细节与全局上下文。

Result: 在RescueNet数据集（4,494张无人机图像）上：MCANet达到91.75% mAP，优于ResNet、Res2Net、VGG等基准模型；使用8个注意力头时性能提升至92.35%，对Road Blocked等困难类别的AP提升超过6%。

Abstract: Rapid and accurate post-hurricane damage assessment is vital for disaster
response and recovery. Yet existing CNN-based methods struggle to capture
multi-scale spatial features and to distinguish visually similar or
co-occurring damage types. To address these issues, we propose MCANet, a
multi-label classification framework that learns multi-scale representations
and adaptively attends to spatially relevant regions for each damage category.
MCANet employs a Res2Net-based hierarchical backbone to enrich spatial context
across scales and a multi-head class-specific residual attention module to
enhance discrimination. Each attention branch focuses on different spatial
granularities, balancing local detail with global context. We evaluate MCANet
on the RescueNet dataset of 4,494 UAV images collected after Hurricane Michael.
MCANet achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 91.75%, outperforming ResNet,
Res2Net, VGG, MobileNet, EfficientNet, and ViT. With eight attention heads,
performance further improves to 92.35%, boosting average precision for
challenging classes such as Road Blocked by over 6%. Class activation mapping
confirms MCANet's ability to localize damage-relevant regions, supporting
interpretability. Outputs from MCANet can inform post-disaster risk mapping,
emergency routing, and digital twin-based disaster response. Future work could
integrate disaster-specific knowledge graphs and multimodal large language
models to improve adaptability to unseen disasters and enrich semantic
understanding for real-world decision-making.

Result: 在公开数据集上优于最先进的分组检测方法

Conclusion: 提出的动态分组检测方法能够有效处理视频中变化的人群分组结构，结合局部和全局特征以及时间一致性优化取得了优异性能

Abstract: This paper proposes dynamic human group detection in videos. For detecting
complex groups, not only the local appearance features of in-group members but
also the global context of the scene are important. Such local and global
appearance features in each frame are extracted using a Vision-Language Model
(VLM) augmented for group detection in our method. For further improvement, the
group structure should be consistent over time. While previous methods are

*Zhangding Liu,Neda Mohammadi,John E. Taylor*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FloodVision是一个零样本洪水深度估计框架，结合GPT-4o的视觉语言能力和结构化知识图谱，通过识别参考物体和统计过滤实现准确的水深测量，在110张图像上达到8.17厘米的平均绝对误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算机视觉洪水检测方法存在准确性限制和泛化能力差的问题，依赖于固定的物体检测器和任务特定训练，需要开发能够跨不同洪水场景准确估计水深的通用方法。

Method: 结合基础视觉语言模型GPT-4o的语义推理能力和结构化领域知识图谱，动态识别RGB图像中的参考物体，从知识图谱检索已验证高度信息，估计淹没比例，并应用统计异常值过滤计算最终水深值。

Result: 在MyCoast New York的110张众包图像上评估，FloodVision达到8.17厘米的平均绝对误差，比GPT-4o基线(10.28厘米)降低20.5%，并超越先前的CNN方法，在不同场景中泛化良好且接近实时运行。

Conclusion: FloodVision为零样本洪水深度估计提供了有效的解决方案，适合未来集成到数字孪生平台和公民报告应用中，增强智慧城市的洪水韧性。

Abstract: Timely and accurate floodwater depth estimation is critical for road
accessibility and emergency response. While recent computer vision methods have
enabled flood detection, they suffer from both accuracy limitations and poor
generalization due to dependence on fixed object detectors and task-specific
training. To enable accurate depth estimation that can generalize across
diverse flood scenarios, this paper presents FloodVision, a zero-shot framework
that combines the semantic reasoning abilities of the foundation
vision-language model GPT-4o with a structured domain knowledge graph. The
knowledge graph encodes canonical real-world dimensions for common urban
objects including vehicles, people, and infrastructure elements to ground the
model's reasoning in physical reality. FloodVision dynamically identifies
visible reference objects in RGB images, retrieves verified heights from the
knowledge graph to mitigate hallucination, estimates submergence ratios, and
applies statistical outlier filtering to compute final depth values. Evaluated
on 110 crowdsourced images from MyCoast New York, FloodVision achieves a mean
absolute error of 8.17 cm, reducing the GPT-4o baseline 10.28 cm by 20.5% and
surpassing prior CNN-based methods. The system generalizes well across varying
scenes and operates in near real-time, making it suitable for future
integration into digital twin platforms and citizen-reporting apps for smart
city flood resilience.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的混合塔框架PIG，通过生成伪查询实现细粒度交互，在文本-视频检索任务中同时实现了高效果和高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有CLIP-based方法中Two-Tower框架效果低、Single-Tower框架效率低的问题，希望同时获得高效果和高效率。

Method: 提出PIG方法，包含伪查询生成器为每个视频生成伪查询，使视频特征和文本特征在细粒度层面交互，在推理阶段不增加额外开销。

Result: 在五个常用文本-视频检索基准测试中，R@1指标提升1.6%~3.9%，效率与Two-Tower模型相当，性能接近state-of-the-art。

Conclusion: 混合塔框架成功结合了双塔和单塔框架的优势，在保持高效率的同时实现了显著性能提升，证明了该框架的优越性。

Abstract: The Text-to-Video Retrieval (T2VR) task aims to retrieve unlabeled videos by
textual queries with the same semantic meanings. Recent CLIP-based approaches
have explored two frameworks: Two-Tower versus Single-Tower framework, yet the
former suffers from low effectiveness, while the latter suffers from low
efficiency. In this study, we explore a new Hybrid-Tower framework that can
hybridize the advantages of the Two-Tower and Single-Tower framework, achieving
high effectiveness and efficiency simultaneously. We propose a novel hybrid
method, Fine-grained Pseudo-query Interaction and Generation for T2VR, ie, PIG,
which includes a new pseudo-query generator designed to generate a pseudo-query
for each video. This enables the video feature and the textual features of
pseudo-query to interact in a fine-grained manner, similar to the Single-Tower
approaches to hold high effectiveness, even before the real textual query is
received. Simultaneously, our method introduces no additional storage or
computational overhead compared to the Two-Tower framework during the inference
stage, thus maintaining high efficiency. Extensive experiments on five commonly
used text-video retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a
significant improvement over the baseline, with an increase of $1.6\% \sim
3.9\%$ in R@1. Furthermore, our method matches the efficiency of Two-Tower
models while achieving near state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the
advantages of the Hybrid-Tower framework.

TL;DR: 评估五种特征匹配算法在月球多模态图像配准中的性能，发现深度学习算法SuperGlue在精度和速度上表现最佳，传统方法在极区光照条件下性能下降


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 月球探测需要精确的图像配准来进行表面测绘、资源定位和任务规划，但不同传感器（光学、高光谱、雷达）的数据由于分辨率、光照和传感器畸变差异而难以对齐

Method: 使用SIFT、ASIFT、AKAZE、RIFT2和SuperGlue五种算法，对赤道和极区区域的跨模态图像对进行测试，并提出包括地理参考、分辨率对齐、强度归一化以及自适应直方图均衡化、主成分分析和阴影校正的预处理流程

Result: SuperGlue始终产生最低的均方根误差和最快的运行时间，传统方法如SIFT和AKAZE在赤道附近表现良好但在极区光照条件下性能下降

Conclusion: 预处理和学习型方法对于在不同条件下实现鲁棒的月球图像配准至关重要，深度学习算法在跨模态月球图像配准中具有明显优势

Abstract: Accurate image registration is critical for lunar exploration, enabling
surface mapping, resource localization, and mission planning. Aligning data
from diverse lunar sensors -- optical (e.g., Orbital High Resolution Camera,
Narrow and Wide Angle Cameras), hyperspectral (Imaging Infrared Spectrometer),
and radar (e.g., Dual-Frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar, Selene/Kaguya
mission) -- is challenging due to differences in resolution, illumination, and
sensor distortion. We evaluate five feature matching algorithms: SIFT, ASIFT,
AKAZE, RIFT2, and SuperGlue (a deep learning-based matcher), using
cross-modality image pairs from equatorial and polar regions. A preprocessing
pipeline is proposed, including georeferencing, resolution alignment, intensity
normalization, and enhancements like adaptive histogram equalization, principal
component analysis, and shadow correction. SuperGlue consistently yields the
lowest root mean square error and fastest runtimes. Classical methods such as
SIFT and AKAZE perform well near the equator but degrade under polar lighting.
The results highlight the importance of preprocessing and learning-based
approaches for robust lunar image registration across diverse conditions.

Motivation: 传统皮肤病诊断方法成本高、复杂且在资源匮乏地区不可用，现有深度学习研究多局限于皮肤镜数据集和有限疾病类别，需要开发更贴近真实世界条件的移动端分类方案。

Method: 构建包含50多种皮肤疾病的大型移动设备拍摄数据集，评估多种CNN和Transformer架构，采用Swin Transformer模型，并集成Grad-CAM进行可视化解释。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的方法在移动端皮肤病变分类中具有巨大潜力，为资源有限环境下的AI辅助皮肤病筛查和早期诊断开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Skin diseases are among the most prevalent health concerns worldwide, yet
conventional diagnostic methods are often costly, complex, and unavailable in
low-resource settings. Automated classification using deep learning has emerged
as a promising alternative, but existing studies are mostly limited to
dermoscopic datasets and a narrow range of disease classes. In this work, we
curate a large dataset of over 50 skin disease categories captured with mobile
devices, making it more representative of real-world conditions. We evaluate
multiple convolutional neural networks and Transformer-based architectures,
demonstrating that Transformer models, particularly the Swin Transformer,
achieve superior performance by effectively capturing global contextual
features. To enhance interpretability, we incorporate Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), which highlights clinically relevant regions and
provides transparency in model predictions. Our results underscore the
potential of Transformer-based approaches for mobile-acquired skin lesion
classification, paving the way toward accessible AI-assisted dermatological
screening and early diagnosis in resource-limited environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于混合专家模型(MoE)的预测不确定性估计方法，通过门控网络动态加权专家预测，在无需架构修改的情况下获得良好校准的不确定性估计，在OOD数据下表现优于集成方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在交通场景感知等安全关键应用中，需要准确且良好校准的预测不确定性来增强计算机视觉模型的可靠性。传统集成方法计算成本高，而混合专家模型提供了更高效的替代方案。

Method: 使用混合专家模型(MoE)，通过门控网络动态加权专家预测。研究了三种不确定性提取方法：预测熵、互信息和专家方差。在A2D2数据集上训练具有两个专家的MoE模型，并在Cityscapes数据集上验证专家数量增加的效果。

Result: MoE在OOD数据下比集成方法产生更可靠的不确定性估计；简单门控机制比复杂类别门控能更好地校准路由不确定性；增加专家数量可以进一步提升不确定性校准效果。

Conclusion: 混合专家模型是量化预测不确定性的有效方法，在保持高效性的同时提供了比传统集成方法更好的不确定性校准性能，特别是在处理分布外数据时表现优异。

Abstract: Estimating accurate and well-calibrated predictive uncertainty is important
for enhancing the reliability of computer vision models, especially in
safety-critical applications like traffic scene perception. While ensemble
methods are commonly used to quantify uncertainty by combining multiple models,
a mixture of experts (MoE) offers an efficient alternative by leveraging a
gating network to dynamically weight expert predictions based on the input.
Building on the promising use of MoEs for semantic segmentation in our previous
works, we show that well-calibrated predictive uncertainty estimates can be
extracted from MoEs without architectural modifications. We investigate three
methods to extract predictive uncertainty estimates: predictive entropy, mutual
information, and expert variance. We evaluate these methods for an MoE with two
experts trained on a semantical split of the A2D2 dataset. Our results show
that MoEs yield more reliable uncertainty estimates than ensembles in terms of
conditional correctness metrics under out-of-distribution (OOD) data.
Additionally, we evaluate routing uncertainty computed via gate entropy and
find that simple gating mechanisms lead to better calibration of routing
uncertainty estimates than more complex classwise gates. Finally, our
experiments on the Cityscapes dataset suggest that increasing the number of
experts can further enhance uncertainty calibration. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出LFMT框架，结合Mamba和Transformer优势，通过子空间简单扫描策略和双阶段建模，在光场图像超分辨率任务中实现高效特征提取和性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Mamba方法在光场超分辨率中存在多方向扫描策略效率低下、特征冗余的问题，且状态空间模型在保持空间-角度和视差信息方面存在局限。

Method: 提出子空间简单扫描策略(Sub-SS)和子空间简单Mamba块(SSMB)；采用双阶段建模：第一阶段用空间-角度残差子空间Mamba块(SA-RSMB)提取浅层特征，第二阶段用极平面Mamba块(EPMB)和极平面Transformer块(EPTB)并行结构进行深度特征精炼。

Result: LFMT在真实和合成光场数据集上显著超越当前最优方法，在保持低计算复杂度的同时实现了性能的实质性提升。

Conclusion: LFMT框架成功整合了Mamba和Transformer的优势，能够全面探索空间、角度和极平面域的信息，为光场超分辨率提供了高效且性能优异的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based methods, with its advantage in long-range information
modeling and linear complexity, have shown great potential in optimizing both
computational cost and performance of light field image super-resolution
(LFSR). However, current multi-directional scanning strategies lead to
inefficient and redundant feature extraction when applied to complex LF data.
To overcome this challenge, we propose a Subspace Simple Scanning (Sub-SS)
strategy, based on which we design the Subspace Simple Mamba Block (SSMB) to
achieve more efficient and precise feature extraction. Furthermore, we propose
a dual-stage modeling strategy to address the limitation of state space in
preserving spatial-angular and disparity information, thereby enabling a more
comprehensive exploration of non-local spatial-angular correlations.
Specifically, in stage I, we introduce the Spatial-Angular Residual Subspace
Mamba Block (SA-RSMB) for shallow spatial-angular feature extraction; in stage
II, we use a dual-branch parallel structure combining the Epipolar Plane Mamba
Block (EPMB) and Epipolar Plane Transformer Block (EPTB) for deep epipolar
feature refinement. Building upon meticulously designed modules and strategies,
we introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer framework, termed LFMT. LFMT integrates
the strengths of Mamba and Transformer models for LFSR, enabling comprehensive
information exploration across spatial, angular, and epipolar-plane domains.
Experimental results demonstrate that LFMT significantly outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods in LFSR, achieving substantial improvements in
performance while maintaining low computational complexity on both real-word
and synthetic LF datasets.

TL;DR: PropVG是一个端到端的基于候选框的视觉定位框架，首次将前景目标候选框生成与指代目标理解无缝集成，无需额外检测器。通过对比学习评分模块和多粒度目标判别模块，在多个基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的端到端视觉定位方法仅依赖指代目标进行监督，忽略了潜在前景目标的益处，且缺乏多粒度判别能力，在复杂场景中目标识别不够鲁棒。

Method: 提出PropVG框架，包含对比学习指代评分模块（CRS）在句子和词汇级别进行对比学习，以及多粒度目标判别模块（MTD）融合对象和语义级别信息。

Result: 在gRefCOCO、Ref-ZOM、R-RefCOCO和RefCOCO等多个基准测试上进行了广泛实验，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: PropVG成功解决了现有方法的局限性，通过集成候选框生成和指代理解，结合对比学习和多粒度判别，显著提升了视觉定位性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in visual grounding have largely shifted away from
traditional proposal-based two-stage frameworks due to their inefficiency and
high computational complexity, favoring end-to-end direct reference paradigms.
However, these methods rely exclusively on the referred target for supervision,
overlooking the potential benefits of prominent prospective targets. Moreover,
existing approaches often fail to incorporate multi-granularity discrimination,
which is crucial for robust object identification in complex scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose PropVG, an end-to-end proposal-based
framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to seamlessly
integrate foreground object proposal generation with referential object
comprehension without requiring additional detectors. Furthermore, we introduce
a Contrastive-based Refer Scoring (CRS) module, which employs contrastive
learning at both sentence and word levels to enhance the capability in
understanding and distinguishing referred objects. Additionally, we design a
Multi-granularity Target Discrimination (MTD) module that fuses object- and
semantic-level information to improve the recognition of absent targets.
Extensive experiments on gRefCOCO (GREC/GRES), Ref-ZOM, R-RefCOCO, and RefCOCO
(REC/RES) benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of PropVG. The codes and
models are available at https://github.com/Dmmm1997/PropVG.

Motivation: 超燃冲压发动机燃烧模拟产生的大规模高维时间流场数据给视觉解释、特征区分和跨案例比较带来了巨大挑战，需要专门的分析工具来支持专家理解复杂的燃烧动力学。

Method: 使用预训练的视觉变换器提取高维嵌入特征，应用降维和基于密度的聚类发现潜在燃烧模式，构建时间轨迹跟踪模拟演化，并通过视觉语言模型生成自然语言描述。

Abstract: Understanding the complex combustion dynamics within scramjet engines is
critical for advancing high-speed propulsion technologies. However, the large
scale and high dimensionality of simulation-generated temporal flow field data
present significant challenges for visual interpretation, feature
differentiation, and cross-case comparison. In this paper, we present
TemporalFlowViz, a parameter-aware visual analytics workflow and system
designed to support expert-driven clustering, visualization, and interpretation
of temporal flow fields from scramjet combustion simulations. Our approach
leverages hundreds of simulated combustion cases with varying initial
conditions, each producing time-sequenced flow field images. We use pretrained
Vision Transformers to extract high-dimensional embeddings from these frames,
apply dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to uncover latent
combustion modes, and construct temporal trajectories in the embedding space to
track the evolution of each simulation over time. To bridge the gap between
latent representations and expert reasoning, domain specialists annotate
representative cluster centroids with descriptive labels. These annotations are
used as contextual prompts for a vision-language model, which generates
natural-language summaries for individual frames and full simulation cases. The
system also supports parameter-based filtering, similarity-based case
retrieval, and coordinated multi-view exploration to facilitate in-depth
analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TemporalFlowViz through two
expert-informed case studies and expert feedback, showing TemporalFlowViz
enhances hypothesis generation, supports interpretable pattern discovery, and
enhances knowledge discovery in large-scale scramjet combustion analysis.

TL;DR: OmniFHT是一个无需姿态信息的3D折射率重建框架，通过傅里叶衍射定理和隐式神经表示，解决了传统流式细胞术中细胞旋转假设限制的问题，支持任意几何形状和多轴旋转的细胞成像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前流式细胞术3D定量相位成像方法假设细胞进行均匀单轴旋转，需要已知每帧姿态，这限制了方法对近球形细胞的适用性，无法准确成像具有复杂旋转的不规则形状细胞，只能分析细胞群体的子集。

Method: 采用傅里叶衍射定理和隐式神经表示(INRs)，通过联合优化每个细胞的未知旋转轨迹和体积结构，在弱散射假设下实现3D折射率重建。支持稀疏采样投影和有限角度覆盖的连续表示。

Result: OmniFHT能够从仅10个视图或120度角度范围内产生高保真度重建结果，首次实现了对整个流动细胞群体的原位高通量断层成像。

Conclusion: 该方法为流式细胞术平台提供了可扩展且无偏见的无标记形态计量分析解决方案，突破了传统方法的几何形状和旋转限制。

Abstract: High-throughput 3D quantitative phase imaging (QPI) in flow cytometry enables
label-free, volumetric characterization of individual cells by reconstructing
their refractive index (RI) distributions from multiple viewing angles during
flow through microfluidic channels. However, current imaging methods assume
that cells undergo uniform, single-axis rotation, which require their poses to
be known at each frame. This assumption restricts applicability to
near-spherical cells and prevents accurate imaging of irregularly shaped cells
with complex rotations. As a result, only a subset of the cellular population
can be analyzed, limiting the ability of flow-based assays to perform robust
statistical analysis. We introduce OmniFHT, a pose-free 3D RI reconstruction
framework that leverages the Fourier diffraction theorem and implicit neural
representations (INRs) for high-throughput flow cytometry tomographic imaging.
By jointly optimizing each cell's unknown rotational trajectory and volumetric
structure under weak scattering assumptions, OmniFHT supports arbitrary cell
geometries and multi-axis rotations. Its continuous representation also allows
accurate reconstruction from sparsely sampled projections and restricted
angular coverage, producing high-fidelity results with as few as 10 views or
only 120 degrees of angular range. OmniFHT enables, for the first time, in
situ, high-throughput tomographic imaging of entire flowing cell populations,
providing a scalable and unbiased solution for label-free morphometric analysis
in flow cytometry platforms.

Motivation: 移动自主机器人需要快速准确的3D重建，特别是在应急响应等关键应用中。传统方法重建整个场景效率低下，而关注特定兴趣点(PoIs)更为高效。

Method: 首先使用语义高斯泼溅生成粗略的分割就绪场景，然后通过新颖的基于颜色的有效过滤技术对语义对象进行细化，实现有效的对象隔离。

Result: 在两个数据集(SCRREAM真实室外和NeRDS 360合成室内)上评估，显示运行时间减少且新视角合成质量更高。训练时间比完整语义GS训练周期减少约四分之一。

Conclusion: CoRe-GS方法在保持高质量重建的同时显著减少了训练时间，为移动机器人应用提供了高效的语义3D重建解决方案。

Abstract: Mobile reconstruction for autonomous aerial robotics holds strong potential
for critical applications such as tele-guidance and disaster response. These
tasks demand both accurate 3D reconstruction and fast scene processing. Instead
of reconstructing the entire scene in detail, it is often more efficient to
focus on specific objects, i.e., points of interest (PoIs). Mobile robots
equipped with advanced sensing can usually detect these early during data
acquisition or preliminary analysis, reducing the need for full-scene
optimization. Gaussian Splatting (GS) has recently shown promise in delivering
high-quality novel view synthesis and 3D representation by an incremental
learning process. Extending GS with scene editing, semantics adds useful
per-splat features to isolate objects effectively.
  Semantic 3D Gaussian editing can already be achieved before the full training
cycle is completed, reducing the overall training time. Moreover, the
semantically relevant area, the PoI, is usually already known during capturing.
To balance high-quality reconstruction with reduced training time, we propose
CoRe-GS. We first generate a coarse segmentation-ready scene with semantic GS
and then refine it for the semantic object using our novel color-based
effective filtering for effective object isolation. This is speeding up the
training process to be about a quarter less than a full training cycle for
semantic GS. We evaluate our approach on two datasets, SCRREAM (real-world,
outdoor) and NeRDS 360 (synthetic, indoor), showing reduced runtime and higher
novel-view-synthesis quality.

Abstract: Cryoablation is a minimally invasive localised treatment for prostate cancer
that destroys malignant tissue during de-freezing, while sparing surrounding
healthy structures. Its success depends on accurate preoperative planning of
cryoprobe placements to fully cover the tumour and avoid critical anatomy. This
planning is currently manual, expertise-dependent, and time-consuming, leading
to variability in treatment quality and limited scalability. In this work, we
introduce Cryo-RL, a reinforcement learning framework that models cryoablation
planning as a Markov decision process and learns an optimal policy for
cryoprobe placement. Within a simulated environment that models clinical
constraints and stochastic intraoperative variability, an agent sequentially
selects cryoprobe positions and ice sphere diameters. Guided by a reward
function based on tumour coverage, this agent learns a cryoablation strategy
that leads to optimal cryoprobe placements without the need for any
manually-designed plans. Evaluated on 583 retrospective prostate cancer cases,
Cryo-RL achieved over 8 percentage-point Dice improvements compared with the
best automated baselines, based on geometric optimisation, and matched human
expert performance while requiring substantially less planning time. These
results highlight the potential of reinforcement learning to deliver clinically
viable, reproducible, and efficient cryoablation plans.

Abstract: Advances in computer vision have opened new avenues for clinical
applications, particularly in computerized exposure therapy where visual
stimuli can be dynamically adjusted based on patient responses. As a critical
step toward such adaptive systems, we investigated whether pretrained computer
vision models can accurately predict fear levels from spider-related images. We
adapted three diverse models using transfer learning to predict human fear
ratings (on a 0-100 scale) from a standardized dataset of 313 images. The
models were evaluated using cross-validation, achieving an average mean
absolute error (MAE) between 10.1 and 11.0. Our learning curve analysis
revealed that reducing the dataset size significantly harmed performance,
though further increases yielded no substantial gains. Explainability
assessments showed the models' predictions were based on spider-related
features. A category-wise error analysis further identified visual conditions
associated with higher errors (e.g., distant views and artificial/painted
spiders). These findings demonstrate the potential of explainable computer
vision models in predicting fear ratings, highlighting the importance of both
model explainability and a sufficient dataset size for developing effective
emotion-aware therapeutic technologies.

Abstract: We propose an approach to generate synthetic data to train computer vision
(CV) models for industrial wear and tear detection. Wear and tear detection is
an important CV problem for predictive maintenance tasks in any industry.
However, data curation for training such models is expensive and time-consuming
due to the unavailability of datasets for different wear and tear scenarios.
Our approach employs a vision language model along with a 3D simulation and
rendering engine to generate synthetic data for varying rust conditions. We
evaluate our approach by training a CV model for rust detection using the
generated dataset and tested the trained model on real images of rusted
industrial objects. The model trained with the synthetic data generated by our
approach, outperforms the other approaches with a mAP50 score of 0.87. The
approach is customizable and can be easily extended to other industrial wear
and tear detection scenarios

### [124] [Evaluating Multiple Instance Learning Strategies for Automated Sebocyte Droplet Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04895)
*Maryam Adelipour,Gustavo Carneiro,Jeongkwon Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于注意力机制的多实例学习框架，用于自动化计数皮胶细胞中的皮胶滴，但发现简单的集合方法比复杂的注意力模型更稳定有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动计数皮胶细胞中的皮胶滴非常耗时且主观，需要自动化解决方案来提高效率和准确性。

Method: 使用Nile Red染色的皮胶细胞图像，按滴数分为14个类别，通过数据增帽扩展到约50,000个细胞。比较了两种模型：基准多层感知机（MLP）和基于ResNet-50特征的注意力MIL模型。

Result: 基准MLP模型表现更稳定（平均MAE = 5.6），而注意力MIL模型不太一致（平均MAE = 10.7），但在某些特定折叠中更优。

Conclusion: 简单的集合方法为皮胶滴计数提供了稳健的基准，而注意力MIL需要任务对齐的池化和正则化才能充分发挥其潜力。

Abstract: Sebocytes are lipid-secreting cells whose differentiation is marked by the
accumulation of intracellular lipid droplets, making their quantification a key
readout in sebocyte biology. Manual counting is labor-intensive and subjective,
motivating automated solutions. Here, we introduce a simple attention-based
multiple instance learning (MIL) framework for sebocyte image analysis. Nile
Red-stained sebocyte images were annotated into 14 classes according to droplet
counts, expanded via data augmentation to about 50,000 cells. Two models were
benchmarked: a baseline multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained on aggregated
patch-level counts, and an attention-based MIL model leveraging ResNet-50
features with instance weighting. Experiments using five-fold cross-validation
showed that the baseline MLP achieved more stable performance (mean MAE = 5.6)
compared with the attention-based MIL, which was less consistent (mean MAE =
10.7) but occasionally superior in specific folds. These findings indicate that
simple bag-level aggregation provides a robust baseline for slide-level droplet
counting, while attention-based MIL requires task-aligned pooling and
regularization to fully realize its potential in sebocyte image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniView是一个新颖的单图像新视角合成方法，通过检索相似物体的参考图像提供强先验信息，使用多模态大语言模型辅助选择参考图像，并采用多级隔离层的适配器模块和分离三重注意力机制来提升合成质量。

Method: 1) 构建检索和增强系统，使用多模态大语言模型选择符合要求的参考图像；2) 引入具有多级隔离层的即插即用适配器模块，为目标视图动态生成参考特征；3) 设计分离三重注意力机制，有效对齐和整合多分支特征以保留原始输入图像细节。

Result: 大量实验表明，UniView显著提升了新视角合成性能，在具有挑战性的数据集上优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 通过利用相似物体的参考图像提供强先验信息，并结合多模态语言模型和创新的注意力机制，UniView有效解决了单图像新视角合成中的失真问题，取得了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: The task of synthesizing novel views from a single image is highly ill-posed
due to multiple explanations for unobserved areas. Most current methods tend to
generate unseen regions from ambiguity priors and interpolation near input
views, which often lead to severe distortions. To address this limitation, we
propose a novel model dubbed as UniView, which can leverage reference images
from a similar object to provide strong prior information during view
synthesis. More specifically, we construct a retrieval and augmentation system
and employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to assist in selecting
reference images that meet our requirements. Additionally, a plug-and-play
adapter module with multi-level isolation layers is introduced to dynamically
generate reference features for the target views. Moreover, in order to
preserve the details of an original input image, we design a decoupled triple
attention mechanism, which can effectively align and integrate multi-branch
features into the synthesis process. Extensive experiments have demonstrated
that our UniView significantly improves novel view synthesis performance and
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the challenging datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MFM-Mapper是一个高效的多基础模型映射器，通过融合双视觉编码器特征和使用GPT-2进行跨模态特征对齐，在视频到音频生成任务中实现了更好的语义和时间一致性，且训练效率显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频到音频生成方法需要从零训练模型，资源消耗大。虽然已有工作探索使用预训练模型，但仍有改进空间。本文旨在通过融合多个基础模型的优势，提升特征丰富度和训练效率。

Method: 提出MFM-Mapper方法：1）使用双视觉编码器融合更丰富的语义和时间特征；2）用GPT-2替代线性映射器，将跨模态特征映射视为自回归翻译任务；3）保持轻量级映射网络架构。

Result: MFM-Mapper仅需之前映射器方法16%的训练规模，就能达到竞争性性能。在语义和时间一致性方面表现更好，训练效率显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过融合多个基础模型特征和使用GPT-2进行特征对齐，MFM-Mapper在视频到音频生成任务中实现了更高的效率和更好的性能，为跨模态生成任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation relies on extracting semantic and
temporal features from video to condition generative models. Training these
models from scratch is resource intensive. Consequently, leveraging foundation
models (FMs) has gained traction due to their cross-modal knowledge transfer
and generalization capabilities. One prior work has explored fine-tuning a
lightweight mapper network to connect a pre-trained visual encoder with a
text-to-audio generation model for V2A. Inspired by this, we introduce the
Multiple Foundation Model Mapper (MFM-Mapper). Compared to the previous mapper
approach, MFM-Mapper benefits from richer semantic and temporal information by
fusing features from dual visual encoders. Furthermore, by replacing a linear
mapper with GPT-2, MFM-Mapper improves feature alignment, drawing parallels
between cross-modal features mapping and autoregressive translation tasks. Our
MFM-Mapper exhibits remarkable training efficiency. It achieves better
performance in semantic and temporal consistency with fewer training consuming,
requiring only 16\% of the training scale compared to previous mapper-based
work, yet achieves competitive performance with models trained on a much larger
scale.

TL;DR: 提出GD^2Fusion框架，通过视觉语言模型进行退化感知和双域联合优化，解决双源退化场景下的红外-可见光图像融合问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设高质量输入，无法处理双源退化场景，需要手动选择多个预增强步骤，导致误差累积和性能下降

Method: 使用GFMSE模块进行频域退化感知和抑制，GSMAF模块进行空间域跨模态退化过滤和自适应特征聚合

Result: 在双源退化场景下取得优于现有算法的融合性能

Conclusion: GD^2Fusion框架有效解决了双源退化场景下的图像融合问题，代码将在论文接受后公开

Abstract: Most existing infrared-visible image fusion (IVIF) methods assume
high-quality inputs, and therefore struggle to handle dual-source degraded
scenarios, typically requiring manual selection and sequential application of
multiple pre-enhancement steps. This decoupled pre-enhancement-to-fusion
pipeline inevitably leads to error accumulation and performance degradation. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Guided Dual-Domain Fusion (GD^2Fusion),
a novel framework that synergistically integrates vision-language models (VLMs)
for degradation perception with dual-domain (frequency/spatial) joint
optimization. Concretely, the designed Guided Frequency Modality-Specific
Extraction (GFMSE) module performs frequency-domain degradation perception and
suppression and discriminatively extracts fusion-relevant sub-band features.
Meanwhile, the Guided Spatial Modality-Aggregated Fusion (GSMAF) module carries
out cross-modal degradation filtering and adaptive multi-source feature
aggregation in the spatial domain to enhance modality complementarity and
structural consistency. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments
demonstrate that GD^2Fusion achieves superior fusion performance compared with
existing algorithms and strategies in dual-source degraded scenarios. The code
will be publicly released after acceptance of this paper.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women
worldwide. Ultrasound imaging, widely used due to its safety and
cost-effectiveness, plays a key role in early detection, especially in patients
with dense breast tissue. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the
application of machine learning and deep learning techniques for breast cancer
classification using ultrasound images. Using datasets such as BUSI, BUS-BRA,
and BrEaST-Lesions USG, we evaluate classical machine learning models (SVM,
KNN) and deep convolutional neural networks (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0,
GoogLeNet). Experimental results show that ResNet-18 achieves the highest
accuracy (99.7%) and perfect sensitivity for malignant lesions. Classical ML
models, though outperformed by CNNs, achieve competitive performance when
enhanced with deep feature extraction. Grad-CAM visualizations further improve
model transparency by highlighting diagnostically relevant image regions. These
findings support the integration of AI-based diagnostic tools into clinical
workflows and demonstrate the feasibility of deploying high-performing,
interpretable systems for ultrasound-based breast cancer detection.

Motivation: 解决低光交通场景中现有感知模型因严重光照退化和缺乏可靠视觉线索而难以快速适应和准确预测的问题，以及缺乏专门的大规模基准数据集

Method: 提出物理基础的光照退化方法构建Dark-traffic数据集；设计SLVM模型，包含光适应瞳孔机制、特征级可分离学习策略、任务特定解耦分支和空间错位感知融合模块

Result: 在Dark-traffic数据集上：检测性能超越RT-DETR 11.2个百分点，实例分割超越YOLOv12 6.1个百分点，光流估计端点误差降低12.37%；在LIS基准上平均超越Swin Transformer+EnlightenGAN和ConvNeXt-T+EnlightenGAN 11个百分点，超越Mask RCNN 3.1个百分点

Conclusion: SLVM模型在低光交通场景感知中表现出卓越性能，计算开销更低，Dark-traffic数据集和完整代码已开源

Abstract: Fast and accurate object perception in low-light traffic scenes has attracted
increasing attention. However, due to severe illumination degradation and the
lack of reliable visual cues, existing perception models and methods struggle
to quickly adapt to and accurately predict in low-light environments. Moreover,
there is the absence of available large-scale benchmark specifically focused on
low-light traffic scenes. To bridge this gap, we introduce a physically
grounded illumination degradation method tailored to real-world low-light
settings and construct Dark-traffic, the largest densely annotated dataset to
date for low-light traffic scenes, supporting object detection, instance
segmentation, and optical flow estimation. We further propose the Separable
Learning Vision Model (SLVM), a biologically inspired framework designed to
enhance perception under adverse lighting. SLVM integrates four key components:
a light-adaptive pupillary mechanism for illumination-sensitive feature
extraction, a feature-level separable learning strategy for efficient
representation, task-specific decoupled branches for multi-task separable
learning, and a spatial misalignment-aware fusion module for precise
multi-feature alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SLVM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational overhead. Notably, it
outperforms RT-DETR by 11.2 percentage points in detection, YOLOv12 by 6.1
percentage points in instance segmentation, and reduces endpoint error (EPE) of
baseline by 12.37% on Dark-traffic. On the LIS benchmark, the end-to-end
trained SLVM surpasses Swin Transformer+EnlightenGAN and
ConvNeXt-T+EnlightenGAN by an average of 11 percentage points across key
metrics, and exceeds Mask RCNN (with light enhancement) by 3.1 percentage
points. The Dark-traffic dataset and complete code is released at

Motivation: 解决阿拉伯手写字符识别中计算资源需求大和数据集缺乏的挑战，寻求高效、质量较高的解决方案。

Method: 使用四种轻量级MbNets模型（MobileNet、SqueezeNet、MnasNet、ShuffleNet），采用三种过度学习策略（全部微调、部分微调、从头训练），在三个标准数据集上进行实验。

Result: MobileNet表现最优，在IFHCDB数据集上达到99%准确率；全部微调策略效果最好；ShuffleNet在普适性方面表现突出；HIJJA数据集因变化性大而挑战性最大。

Conclusion: 过度学习与轻量级网络的组合为阿拉伯手写字符识别提供了高效解决方案，未来将深入研究网络结构优化、数据增强等方向。

Abstract: The study explores the integration of transfer learning (TL) with
mobile-enabled convolutional neural networks (MbNets) to enhance Arabic
Handwritten Character Recognition (AHCR). Addressing challenges like extensive
computational requirements and dataset scarcity, this research evaluates three
TL strategies--full fine-tuning, partial fine-tuning, and training from
scratch--using four lightweight MbNets: MobileNet, SqueezeNet, MnasNet, and
ShuffleNet. Experiments were conducted on three benchmark datasets: AHCD,
HIJJA, and IFHCDB. MobileNet emerged as the top-performing model, consistently
achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency, with ShuffleNet
excelling in generalization, particularly under full fine-tuning. The IFHCDB
dataset yielded the highest results, with 99% accuracy using MnasNet under full
fine-tuning, highlighting its suitability for robust character recognition. The
AHCD dataset achieved competitive accuracy (97%) with ShuffleNet, while HIJJA
posed significant challenges due to its variability, achieving a peak accuracy
of 92% with ShuffleNet. Notably, full fine-tuning demonstrated the best overall
performance, balancing accuracy and convergence speed, while partial
fine-tuning underperformed across metrics. These findings underscore the
potential of combining TL and MbNets for resource-efficient AHCR, paving the
way for further optimizations and broader applications. Future work will
explore architectural modifications, in-depth dataset feature analysis, data
augmentation, and advanced sensitivity analysis to enhance model robustness and
generalizability.

Abstract: We present LUIVITON, an end-to-end system for fully automated virtual try-on,
capable of draping complex, multi-layer clothing onto diverse and arbitrarily
posed humanoid characters. To address the challenge of aligning complex
garments with arbitrary and highly diverse body shapes, we use SMPL as a proxy
representation and separate the clothing-to-body draping problem into two
correspondence tasks: 1) clothing-to-SMPL and 2) body-to-SMPL correspondence,
where each has its unique challenges. While we address the clothing-to-SMPL
fitting problem using a geometric learning-based approach for
partial-to-complete shape correspondence prediction, we introduce a diffusion
model-based approach for body-to-SMPL correspondence using multi-view
consistent appearance features and a pre-trained 2D foundation model. Our
method can handle complex geometries, non-manifold meshes, and generalizes
effectively to a wide range of humanoid characters -- including humans, robots,
cartoon subjects, creatures, and aliens, while maintaining computational
efficiency for practical adoption. In addition to offering a fully automatic
fitting solution, LUIVITON supports fast customization of clothing size,
allowing users to adjust clothing sizes and material properties after they have
been draped. We show that our system can produce high-quality 3D clothing
fittings without any human labor, even when 2D clothing sewing patterns are not
available.

Result: ADClick在MVTec AD上达到AP=96.1%的优异性能。ADClick-Seg在具有挑战性的多类异常检测任务上取得AP=80.0%、PRO=97.5%、Pixel-AUROC=99.1%的state-of-the-art结果。

Conclusion: ADClick和ADClick-Seg通过交互式分割和跨模态融合，实现了高效精确的异常标注和检测，显著提升了工业异常检测的性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: Industrial product inspection is often performed using Anomaly Detection (AD)
frameworks trained solely on non-defective samples. Although defective samples
can be collected during production, leveraging them usually requires
pixel-level annotations, limiting scalability. To address this, we propose
ADClick, an Interactive Image Segmentation (IIS) algorithm for industrial
anomaly detection. ADClick generates pixel-wise anomaly annotations from only a
few user clicks and a brief textual description, enabling precise and efficient
labeling that significantly improves AD model performance (e.g., AP = 96.1\% on
MVTec AD). We further introduce ADClick-Seg, a cross-modal framework that
aligns visual features and textual prompts via a prototype-based approach for
anomaly detection and localization. By combining pixel-level priors with
language-guided cues, ADClick-Seg achieves state-of-the-art results on the
challenging ``Multi-class'' AD task (AP = 80.0\%, PRO = 97.5\%, Pixel-AUROC =
99.1\% on MVTec AD).

Abstract: Background: To systematically review and perform a meta-analysis of
artificial intelligence (AI)-driven methods for detecting and correcting
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) motion artifacts, assessing current
developments, effectiveness, challenges, and future research directions.
Methods: A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted,
focusing on deep learning (DL) approaches, particularly generative models, for
the detection and correction of MRI motion artifacts. Quantitative data were
extracted regarding utilized datasets, DL architectures, and performance
metrics. Results: DL, particularly generative models, show promise for reducing
motion artifacts and improving image quality; however, limited
generalizability, reliance on paired training data, and risk of visual

show significant potential for improving MRI image quality by effectively
addressing motion artifacts. However, critical challenges must be addressed,
including the need for comprehensive public datasets, standardized reporting
protocols for artifact levels, and more advanced, adaptable DL techniques to

Conclusion: GeoSplat框架通过引入高阶几何先验和鲁棒估计方法，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为高斯泼溅优化提供了更好的几何约束。

Abstract: A few recent works explored incorporating geometric priors to regularize the
optimization of Gaussian splatting, further improving its performance. However,
those early studies mainly focused on the use of low-order geometric priors
(e.g., normal vector), and they are also unreliably estimated by
noise-sensitive methods, like local principal component analysis. To address
their limitations, we first present GeoSplat, a general geometry-constrained
optimization framework that exploits both first-order and second-order
geometric quantities to improve the entire training pipeline of Gaussian
splatting, including Gaussian initialization, gradient update, and
densification. As an example, we initialize the scales of 3D Gaussian
primitives in terms of principal curvatures, leading to a better coverage of
the object surface than random initialization. Secondly, based on certain
geometric structures (e.g., local manifold), we introduce efficient and
noise-robust estimation methods that provide dynamic geometric priors for our
framework. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets for novel view
synthesis, showing that our framework: GeoSplat, significantly improves the
performance of Gaussian splatting and outperforms previous baselines.

Method: 设计Scale-Interaction Transformer (SIT)混合模型，组合CNN的特征提取能力和Transformer的关系建模能力，通过并行卷积获取多尺度面部特征，然后用Transformer编码器通过自注意力机制显式建模它们的相互作用

Result: 在SCUT-FBP5500数据集上达到0.9187的Pearson相关系数，超过之前方法，创造新的狄狄成绩

Conclusion: 显式建模多尺度视觉线索间的相互作用对高性能FBP至关重要，SIT模型显示了CNN-Transformer混合模型在需要全局语境理解的复杂图像回归任务中的潜力

Abstract: Automated Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a challenging computer vision
task due to the complex interplay of local and global facial features that
influence human perception. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at
feature extraction, they often process information at a fixed scale,
potentially overlooking the critical inter-dependencies between features at
different levels of granularity. To address this limitation, we introduce the
Scale-Interaction Transformer (SIT), a novel hybrid deep learning architecture
that synergizes the feature extraction power of CNNs with the relational
modeling capabilities of Transformers. The SIT first employs a multi-scale
module with parallel convolutions to capture facial characteristics at varying
receptive fields. These multi-scale representations are then framed as a
sequence and processed by a Transformer encoder, which explicitly models their
interactions and contextual relationships via a self-attention mechanism. We
conduct extensive experiments on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark
dataset, where the proposed SIT model establishes a new state-of-the-art. It
achieves a Pearson Correlation of 0.9187, outperforming previous methods. Our
findings demonstrate that explicitly modeling the interplay between multi-scale
visual cues is crucial for high-performance FBP. The success of the SIT
architecture highlights the potential of hybrid CNN-Transformer models for
complex image regression tasks that demand a holistic, context-aware
understanding.

Result: 插入MoE层后，在PGD和AutoPGD攻击下鲁棒性得到一致提升；发现路由平衡机制导致专家过度使用，反而使这些路径更加鲁棒，部分单个专家甚至比整个MoE模型更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 稀疏MoE层是提升CNN鲁棒性的有效方法，鲁棒子路径通过专业化自然涌现，为设计更鲁棒的模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Robustifying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) against adversarial attacks
remains challenging and often requires resource-intensive countermeasures. We
explore the use of sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) layers to improve robustness
by replacing selected residual blocks or convolutional layers, thereby
increasing model capacity without additional inference cost. On ResNet
architectures trained on CIFAR-100, we find that inserting a single MoE layer
in the deeper stages leads to consistent improvements in robustness under PGD
and AutoPGD attacks when combined with adversarial training. Furthermore, we
discover that when switch loss is used for balancing, it causes routing to
collapse onto a small set of overused experts, thereby concentrating
adversarial training on these paths and inadvertently making them more robust.
As a result, some individual experts outperform the gated MoE model in
robustness, suggesting that robust subpaths emerge through specialization. Our
code is available at https://github.com/KASTEL-MobilityLab/robust-sparse-moes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CRAFT是一种源数据不可用情况下的半监督域适应方法，专门针对回归任务设计，在神经科学和医学应用中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实应用中源数据无法共享（隐私或计算成本限制）且目标标注数据稀缺的问题，特别是在需要连续值输出的回归任务中

Method: 基于Contradistinguisher框架，开发了CRAFT方法，通过正则化方法实现源自由、半监督的预训练模型迁移，无需中间表示对齐

Result: 在两个神经科学数据集（EEG眼动预测和MRI脑龄预测）上，CRAFT比微调模型RMSE提升9%，比现有源自由域适应方法提升3%以上

Conclusion: CRAFT是生物学和医学中普遍存在的回归任务的高效源自由半监督深度迁移方法

Abstract: Deep learning models deployed in real-world applications (e.g., medicine)
face challenges because source models do not generalize well to domain-shifted
target data. Many successful domain adaptation (DA) approaches require full
access to source data. Yet, such requirements are unrealistic in scenarios
where source data cannot be shared either because of privacy concerns or
because it is too large and incurs prohibitive storage or computational costs.
Moreover, resource constraints may limit the availability of labeled targets.
We illustrate this challenge in a neuroscience setting where source data are
unavailable, labeled target data are meager, and predictions involve
continuous-valued outputs. We build upon Contradistinguisher (CUDA), an
efficient framework that learns a shared model across the labeled source and
unlabeled target samples, without intermediate representation alignment. Yet,
CUDA was designed for unsupervised DA, with full access to source data, and for
classification tasks. We develop CRAFT -- a Contradistinguisher-based
Regularization Approach for Flexible Training -- for source-free (SF),
semi-supervised transfer of pretrained models in regression tasks. We showcase
the efficacy of CRAFT in two neuroscience settings: gaze prediction with
electroencephalography (EEG) data and ``brain age'' prediction with structural
MRI data. For both datasets, CRAFT yielded up to 9% improvement in
root-mean-squared error (RMSE) over fine-tuned models when labeled training
examples were scarce. Moreover, CRAFT leveraged unlabeled target data and
outperformed four competing state-of-the-art source-free domain adaptation
models by more than 3%. Lastly, we demonstrate the efficacy of CRAFT on two
other real-world regression benchmarks. We propose CRAFT as an efficient
approach for source-free, semi-supervised deep transfer for regression that is
ubiquitous in biology and medicine.

TL;DR: 基于Transformer的框架从单张图片和网格直接生成高保真3D纹理，无需UV映射，速度快、质量高


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有生成方法速度慢、依赖UV映射、且无法保持与参考图像高保真的问题

Method: 使用Transformer框架结合三平面表示和基于深度的反向投影损失，直接从单张图片和网格预测3D纹理场

Result: 每个形状只需0.2秒生成高保真纹理，在保真度和感知质量方面超过现有最佳方法

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高效、高质量、可控的3D内容创建，具有强应用价值

Abstract: High-quality textures are critical for realistic 3D content creation, yet
existing generative methods are slow, rely on UV maps, and often fail to remain
faithful to a reference image. To address these challenges, we propose a
transformer-based framework that predicts a 3D texture field directly from a
single image and a mesh, eliminating the need for UV mapping and differentiable
rendering, and enabling faster texture generation. Our method integrates a
triplane representation with depth-based backprojection losses, enabling
efficient training and faster inference. Once trained, it generates
high-fidelity textures in a single forward pass, requiring only 0.2s per shape.
Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and user preference evaluations
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on
single-image texture reconstruction in terms of both fidelity to the input
image and perceptual quality, highlighting its practicality for scalable,
high-quality, and controllable 3D content creation.

TL;DR: SGS-3D是一个训练免费的3D实例分割精炼方法，通过先分割再生长的策略，结合语义和几何信息，显著提升分割精度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于2D到3D提升的3D实例分割方法由于提升过程中的累积误差、模糊语义指导和深度约束不足，难以产生精确的实例级分割。

Method: 提出"先分割再生长"框架：首先利用几何基元净化和分割模糊的提升掩码，然后在场景中将其生长为完整实例。包括基于3D几何基元共现的掩码过滤策略，以及利用空间连续性和高级特征的几何精炼。

Result: 在ScanNet200、ScanNet++和KITTI-360数据集上的实验表明，SGS-3D显著提高了分割精度和鲁棒性，能够处理预训练模型产生的不准确掩码，在室内外环境中都表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SGS-3D通过联合融合语义和几何信息，实现了两种表示层次的有效协作，为高质量3D场景理解提供了高保真的对象实例分割。

Abstract: Accurate 3D instance segmentation is crucial for high-quality scene
understanding in the 3D vision domain. However, 3D instance segmentation based
on 2D-to-3D lifting approaches struggle to produce precise instance-level
segmentation, due to accumulated errors introduced during the lifting process
from ambiguous semantic guidance and insufficient depth constraints. To tackle
these challenges, we propose splitting and growing reliable semantic mask for
high-fidelity 3D instance segmentation (SGS-3D), a novel "split-then-grow"
framework that first purifies and splits ambiguous lifted masks using geometric
primitives, and then grows them into complete instances within the scene.
Unlike existing approaches that directly rely on raw lifted masks and sacrifice
segmentation accuracy, SGS-3D serves as a training-free refinement method that
jointly fuses semantic and geometric information, enabling effective
cooperation between the two levels of representation. Specifically, for
semantic guidance, we introduce a mask filtering strategy that leverages the
co-occurrence of 3D geometry primitives to identify and remove ambiguous masks,
thereby ensuring more reliable semantic consistency with the 3D object
instances. For the geometric refinement, we construct fine-grained object
instances by exploiting both spatial continuity and high-level features,
particularly in the case of semantic ambiguity between distinct objects.
Experimental results on ScanNet200, ScanNet++, and KITTI-360 demonstrate that
SGS-3D substantially improves segmentation accuracy and robustness against
inaccurate masks from pre-trained models, yielding high-fidelity object
instances while maintaining strong generalization across diverse indoor and
outdoor environments. Code is available in the supplementary materials.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对手语识别(SLR)的自监督学习框架，通过自由负样本对和新数据增强技术解决对比学习中忽略关键区域和负样本相似度过高的问题，在多个评估场景中显著提升了准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手语识别面临标注数据稀缺的问题，对比学习方法虽然有效但存在两个主要问题：1) 对所有视频区域同等对待，忽略了关键信息区域的重要性；2) 不同手语之间的共享动作导致负样本对过于相似，增加了识别难度。

Method: 提出了包含两个关键组件的自监督学习框架：1) 使用自由负样本对的新自监督方法；2) 新的数据增强技术。这两个组件协同工作以学习更有区分性的特征表示。

Result: 该方法在多个评估场景中表现出显著优势，包括线性评估、半监督学习以及不同手语之间的可迁移性，相比现有的对比学习和自监督方法获得了相当大的准确率提升。

Conclusion: 所提出的自监督学习框架有效解决了手语识别中对比学习的关键问题，通过学习更有区分性的特征表示，在手语识别任务中取得了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Sign language recognition (SLR) is a machine learning task aiming to identify
signs in videos. Due to the scarcity of annotated data, unsupervised methods
like contrastive learning have become promising in this field. They learn
meaningful representations by pulling positive pairs (two augmented versions of
the same instance) closer and pushing negative pairs (different from the
positive pairs) apart. In SLR, in a sign video, only certain parts provide
information that is truly useful for its recognition. Applying contrastive
methods to SLR raises two issues: (i) contrastive learning methods treat all
parts of a video in the same way, without taking into account the relevance of
certain parts over others; (ii) shared movements between different signs make
negative pairs highly similar, complicating sign discrimination. These issues
lead to learning non-discriminative features for sign recognition and poor
results in downstream tasks. In response, this paper proposes a self-supervised
learning framework designed to learn meaningful representations for SLR. This
framework consists of two key components designed to work together: (i) a new
self-supervised approach with free-negative pairs; (ii) a new data augmentation
technique. This approach shows a considerable gain in accuracy compared to
several contrastive and self-supervised methods, across linear evaluation,
semi-supervised learning, and transferability between sign languages.

Abstract: The classification of 3D point clouds is crucial for applications such as
autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. However, the commonly used
ModelNet40 dataset suffers from limitations such as inconsistent labeling, 2D
data, size mismatches, and inadequate class differentiation, which hinder model
performance. This paper introduces ModelNet-R, a meticulously refined version
of ModelNet40 designed to address these issues and serve as a more reliable
benchmark. Additionally, this paper proposes Point-SkipNet, a lightweight
graph-based neural network that leverages efficient sampling, neighborhood
grouping, and skip connections to achieve high classification accuracy with
reduced computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models
trained in ModelNet-R exhibit significant performance improvements. Notably,
Point-SkipNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ModelNet-R with a
substantially lower parameter count compared to contemporary models. This
research highlights the crucial role of dataset quality in optimizing model
efficiency for 3D point cloud classification. For more details, see the code

Motivation: 探索LLM在生成符号图形程序方面的能力，特别是从自然语言描述生成可渲染精确视觉内容的SVG程序，以此作为理解LLM视觉世界认知的视角。

Method: 引入SGP-GenBench基准测试评估LLM性能；提出强化学习方法，使用格式有效性门确保可渲染SVG，通过跨模态奖励（SigLIP和DINO编码器）对齐文本和渲染图像。

Result: 前沿专有模型显著优于开源模型，性能与通用编码能力相关；提出的强化学习方法使Qwen-2.5-7B模型达到与前沿系统相当的性能，改善了对象分解和场景连贯性。

Conclusion: 符号图形编程为跨模态基础提供了精确且可解释的视角，强化学习方法有效提升了LLM的SVG生成质量和语义理解能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at program synthesis, yet their ability to
produce symbolic graphics programs (SGPs) that render into precise visual
content remains underexplored. We study symbolic graphics programming, where
the goal is to generate an SGP from a natural-language description. This task
also serves as a lens into how LLMs understand the visual world by prompting
them to generate images rendered from SGPs. Among various SGPs, our paper
sticks to scalable vector graphics (SVGs). We begin by examining the extent to
which LLMs can generate SGPs. To this end, we introduce SGP-GenBench, a
comprehensive benchmark covering object fidelity, scene fidelity, and
compositionality (attribute binding, spatial relations, numeracy). On
SGP-GenBench, we discover that frontier proprietary models substantially
outperform open-source models, and performance correlates well with general
coding capabilities. Motivated by this gap, we aim to improve LLMs' ability to
generate SGPs. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards
approach, where a format-validity gate ensures renderable SVG, and a
cross-modal reward aligns text and the rendered image via strong vision
encoders (e.g., SigLIP for text-image and DINO for image-image). Applied to
Qwen-2.5-7B, our method substantially improves SVG generation quality and
semantics, achieving performance on par with frontier systems. We further
analyze training dynamics, showing that RL induces (i) finer decomposition of
objects into controllable primitives and (ii) contextual details that improve
scene coherence. Our results demonstrate that symbolic graphics programming
offers a precise and interpretable lens on cross-modal grounding.

Conclusion: COGITAO作为一个开源框架，为持续研究组合性和泛化问题提供了强大工具，揭示了当前模型在组合泛化方面的系统性失败。

Abstract: The ability to compose learned concepts and apply them in novel settings is
key to human intelligence, but remains a persistent limitation in
state-of-the-art machine learning models. To address this issue, we introduce
COGITAO, a modular and extensible data generation framework and benchmark
designed to systematically study compositionality and generalization in visual
domains. Drawing inspiration from ARC-AGI's problem-setting, COGITAO constructs
rule-based tasks which apply a set of transformations to objects in grid-like
environments. It supports composition, at adjustable depth, over a set of 28
interoperable transformations, along with extensive control over grid
parametrization and object properties. This flexibility enables the creation of
millions of unique task rules -- surpassing concurrent datasets by several
orders of magnitude -- across a wide range of difficulties, while allowing
virtually unlimited sample generation per rule. We provide baseline experiments
using state-of-the-art vision models, highlighting their consistent failures to
generalize to novel combinations of familiar elements, despite strong in-domain
performance. COGITAO is fully open-sourced, including all code and datasets, to
support continued research in this field.

maintain a global camera token pool, which enhances the reliability of camera
pose estimation without sacrificing efficiency. These designs enable WinT3R to
achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of online reconstruction quality,
camera pose estimation, and reconstruction speed, as validated by extensive
experiments on diverse datasets. Code and model are publicly available at
