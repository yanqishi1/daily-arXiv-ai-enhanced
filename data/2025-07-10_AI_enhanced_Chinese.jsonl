Previous work has shown that LLMs are\nlinguistically overconfident in English, leading users to overrely on confident\ngenerations. However, the usage and interpretation of epistemic markers (e.g.,\n'It's definitely,' 'I think') can differ sharply across languages. Here, we\nstudy the risks of multilingual linguistic (mis)calibration, overconfidence,\nand overreliance across five languages to evaluate the safety of LLMs in a\nglobal context.\n  We find that overreliance risks are high across all languages. We first\nanalyze the distribution of LLM-generated epistemic markers, and observe that\nwhile LLMs are cross-linguistically overconfident, they are also sensitive to\ndocumented linguistic variation. For example, models generate the most markers\nof uncertainty in Japanese and the most markers of certainty in German and\nMandarin. We then measure human reliance rates across languages, finding that\nwhile users strongly rely on confident LLM generations in all languages,\nreliance behaviors differ cross-linguistically: for example, users rely\nsignificantly more on expressions of uncertainty in Japanese than in English.\nTaken together, these results indicate high risk of reliance on overconfident\nmodel generations across languages.

Existing interpretability methods\nlike Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) produce latent concepts individually for each\nmodel, resulting in incompatible concept spaces and limiting cross-model\ninterpretability. To address this, we introduce SPARC (Sparse Autoencoders for\nAligned Representation of Concepts), a new framework that learns a single,\nunified latent space shared across diverse architectures and modalities (e.g.,\nvision models like DINO, and multimodal models like CLIP). SPARC's alignment is\nenforced through two key innovations: (1) a Global TopK sparsity mechanism,\nensuring all input streams activate identical latent dimensions for a given\nconcept; and (2) a Cross-Reconstruction Loss, which explicitly encourages\nsemantic consistency between models. On Open Images, SPARC dramatically\nimproves concept alignment, achieving a Jaccard similarity of 0.80, more than\ntripling the alignment compared to previous methods. SPARC creates a shared\nsparse latent space where individual dimensions often correspond to similar\nhigh-level concepts across models and modalities, enabling direct comparison of\nhow different architectures represent identical concepts without requiring\nmanual alignment or model-specific analysis. As a consequence of this aligned\nrepresentation, SPARC also enables practical applications such as text-guided\nspatial localization in vision-only models and cross-model/cross-modal\nretrieval.

To address this bottleneck, we propose Perception-Aware Policy\nOptimization (PAPO), a simple yet effective extension of GRPO that encourages\nthe model to learn to perceive while learning to reason, entirely from internal\nsupervision signals. Notably, PAPO does not rely on additional data curation,\nexternal reward models, or proprietary models.

One reason is that current\npose estimation networks struggle to extract discriminative, pose-aware\nfeatures using 2D feature backbones, especially when the available RGB\ninformation is limited due to target occlusion in cluttered scenes. To mitigate\nthis, we propose a novel pose estimation-specific pre-training strategy named\nMask6D. Our approach incorporates pose-aware 2D-3D correspondence maps and\nvisible mask maps as additional modal information, which is combined with RGB\nimages for the reconstruction-based model pre-training. Essentially, this 2D-3D\ncorrespondence maps a transformed 3D object model to 2D pixels, reflecting the\npose information of the target in camera coordinate system. Meanwhile, the\nintegrated visible mask map can effectively guide our model to disregard\ncluttered background information. In addition, an object-focused pre-training\nloss function is designed to further facilitate our network to remove the\nbackground interference.

Although most past research has\nfocused on turning sign language into text, doing the reverse, turning spoken\nEnglish into sign language animations, has been largely overlooked. That's\nbecause it involves multiple steps, such as understanding speech, translating\nit into sign-friendly grammar, and generating natural human motion. In this\nwork, we introduce a complete pipeline that converts English speech into\nsmooth, realistic 3D sign language animations. Our system starts with Whisper\nto translate spoken English into text. Then, we use a MarianMT machine\ntranslation model to translate that text into American Sign Language (ASL)\ngloss, a simplified version of sign language that captures meaning without\ngrammar. This model performs well, reaching BLEU scores of 0.7714 and 0.8923.\nTo make the gloss translation more accurate, we also use word embeddings such\nas Word2Vec and FastText to understand word meanings. Finally, we animate the\ntranslated gloss using a 3D keypoint-based motion system trained on\nSign3D-WLASL, a dataset we created by extracting body, hand, and face key\npoints from real ASL videos in the WLASL dataset. To support the gloss\ntranslation stage, we also built a new dataset called BookGlossCorpus-CG, which\nturns everyday English sentences from the BookCorpus dataset into ASL gloss\nusing grammar rules. Our system stitches everything together by smoothly\ninterpolating between signs to create natural, continuous animations. Unlike\nprevious works like How2Sign and Phoenix-2014T that focus on recognition or use\nonly one type of data, our pipeline brings together audio, text, and motion in\na single framework that goes all the way from spoken English to lifelike 3D\nsign language animation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u82f1\u8bed\u8bed\u97f3\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6d41\u7545\u76843D\u624b\u8bed\u52a8\u753b\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u6587\u672c\u7ffb\u8bd1\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e2e\u52a9\u804b\u4eba\u548c\u542c\u529b\u969c\u788d\u8005\u66f4\u8f7b\u677e\u5730\u6c9f\u901a\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u4ece\u53e3\u8bed\u5230\u624b\u8bed\u52a8\u753b\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Whisper\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u97f3\u8f6c\u6587\u672c\uff0cMarianMT\u6a21\u578b\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e3aASL gloss\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Word2Vec\u548cFastText\u4f18\u5316\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc73D\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u753b\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0cBLEU\u5206\u6570\u8fbe0.7714\u548c0.8923\uff0c\u5e76\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6BookGlossCorpus-CG\u548cSign3D-WLASL\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u97f3\u9891\u3001\u6587\u672c\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u82f1\u8bed\u8bed\u97f3\u5230\u903c\u771f3D\u624b\u8bed\u52a8\u753b\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u8f6c\u6362\u3002"}}

Most advanced methods model agent interactions by efficiently\nfactorized attention based on the temporal and agent axes. However, this static\nand foward modeling lacks explicit interactive spatio-temporal coordination,\ncapturing only obvious and immediate behavioral intentions. Alternatively, the\nmodern trajectory prediction framework refines the successive predictions by a\nfixed-anchor selection strategy, which is difficult to adapt in different\nfuture environments. It is acknowledged that human drivers dynamically adjust\ninitial driving decisions based on further assumptions about the intentions of\nsurrounding vehicles. Motivated by human driving behaviors, this paper proposes\nILNet, a multi-agent trajectory prediction method with Inverse Learning (IL)\nattention and Dynamic Anchor Selection (DAS) module. IL Attention employs an\ninverse learning paradigm to model interactions at neighboring moments,\nintroducing proposed intentions to dynamically encode the spatio-temporal\ncoordination of interactions, thereby enhancing the model's ability to capture\ncomplex interaction patterns. Then, the learnable DAS module is proposed to\nextract multiple trajectory change keypoints as anchors in parallel with almost\nno increase in parameters. Experimental results show that the ILNet achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION and Argoverse motion\nforecasting datasets.

Most existing methods use equally\npenalized objectives, which ignore the per-point ambiguities and less\ndiscriminated features stemming from transition regions. However, as highly\nambiguous points may be indistinguishable even for humans, their manually\nannotated labels are less reliable, and hard constraints over these points\nwould lead to sub-optimal models. To address this, we first design\nAMContrast3D, a method comprising contrastive learning into an ambiguity\nestimation framework, tailored to adaptive objectives for individual points\nbased on ambiguity levels. As a result, our method promotes model training,\nwhich ensures the correctness of low-ambiguity points while allowing mistakes\nfor high-ambiguity points. As ambiguities are formulated based on position\ndiscrepancies across labels, optimization during inference is constrained by\nthe assumption that all unlabeled points are uniformly unambiguous, lacking\nambiguity awareness. Inspired by the insight of joint training, we further\npropose AMContrast3D++ integrating with two branches trained in parallel, where\na novel ambiguity prediction module concurrently learns point ambiguities from\ngenerated embeddings. To this end, we design a masked refinement mechanism that\nleverages predicted ambiguities to enable the ambiguous embeddings to be more\nreliable, thereby boosting segmentation performance and enhancing robustness.\nExperimental results on 3D indoor scene datasets, S3DIS and ScanNet,\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

However, both paradigms\nface fundamental limitations: sequential scaling typically relies on arbitrary\ntoken budgets for termination, leading to inefficiency or premature cutoff;\nwhile parallel scaling often lacks coordination among parallel branches and\nrequires intrusive fine-tuning to perform effectively. In light of these\nchallenges, we aim to design a flexible test-time collaborative inference\nframework that exploits the complementary strengths of both sequential and\nparallel reasoning paradigms.

Despite these advantages, effectively fusing both\nspatial-dimensional and spectral-dimensional information from MHSIs remains\nchallenging due to its high dimensionality and spectral redundancy inherent\ncharacteristics. To solve the above challenges, we propose a novel\nspatial-spectral omni-fusion network for hyperspectral image segmentation,\nnamed as Omni-Fuse. Here, we introduce abundant cross-dimensional feature\nfusion operations, including a cross-dimensional enhancement module that\nrefines both spatial and spectral features through bidirectional attention\nmechanisms, a spectral-guided spatial query selection to select the most\nspectral-related spatial feature as the query, and a two-stage\ncross-dimensional decoder which dynamically guide the model to focus on the\nselected spatial query.

MIND implements three key strategies: 1) We\nretrieve similar memes from an unannotated reference set to provide contextual\ninformation. 2) We propose a bi-directional insight derivation mechanism to\nextract a comprehensive understanding of similar memes. 3) We then employ a\nmulti-agent debate mechanism to ensure robust decision-making through reasoned\narbitration. Extensive experiments on three meme datasets demonstrate that our\nproposed framework not only outperforms existing zero-shot approaches but also\nshows strong generalization across different model architectures and parameter\nscales, providing a scalable solution for harmful meme detection.

Prominent methods typically frame the restoration\nproblem within a Bayesian inference framework, which iteratively combines a\ndenoising step with a likelihood guidance step.

Their core mechanism involves a forward diffusion process\nthat gradually transforms structured data into a Gaussian-like distribution,\nfollowed by a learned reverse process to reconstruct the data. While successful\nin continuous modalities, applying this framework to discrete data-particularly\nnatural language-remains challenging due to token dependency complexities and\nthe lack of a defined generation order.This thesis investigates the feasibility\nand performance of discrete diffusion models for natural language generation.\nSpecifically, we evaluate the Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model\n(D3PM) and compare it with traditional autoregressive (AR) language models. To\nassess generative performance, we use Bits Per Token (BPT), Negative\nLog-Likelihood (NLL), Perplexity (PPL), and Batch Processing Speed.\n  Results show the best-performing D3PM model achieves a BPT of 5.72, with a\nmean of 8.05. The AR model outperforms in compression with a lower mean BPT of\n4.59, but D3PM achieves higher processing speed, reaching up to 3.97 batches\nper sec., indicating potential for parallel generation.All evaluations were\nconducted under consistent conditions-generating 100,000 tokens per model with\na fixed batch size of four-for fair comparison. This research presents a\ndetailed analysis of diffusion-based vs. autoregressive models, highlighting\ntrade-offs in generative quality and efficiency.

Moreover, FOLC-Net tests a ShallowFed model on different\ndata to evaluate its ability to generalize beyond the training dataset. The\nresults show that FOLC-Net outperforms existing models, particularly in the\nchallenging sagittal view. For instance, FOLC-Net achieved an accuracy of\n92.44% on the sagittal view, significantly higher than the 88.37% accuracy of\nstudy method (DL + Residual Learning) and 88.95% of DL models. Additionally,\nFOLC-Net demonstrated improved accuracy across all individual views, providing\na more reliable and robust solution for medical image analysis in decentralized\nenvironments.

However, existing standard RGB (sRGB) color\nspace-based LLIE methods often produce color bias and brightness artifacts due\nto the inherent high color sensitivity. While Hue, Saturation, and Value (HSV)\ncolor space can decouple brightness and color, it introduces significant red\nand black noise artifacts. To address this problem, we propose a new color\nspace for LLIE, namely Horizontal/Vertical-Intensity (HVI), defined by the HV\ncolor map and learnable intensity. The HV color map enforces small distances\nfor the red coordinates to remove red noise artifacts, while the learnable\nintensity compresses the low-light regions to remove black noise artifacts.\nAdditionally, we introduce the Color and Intensity Decoupling Network+\n(HVI-CIDNet+), built upon the HVI color space, to restore damaged content and\nmitigate color distortion in extremely dark regions. Specifically, HVI-CIDNet+\nleverages abundant contextual and degraded knowledge extracted from low-light\nimages using pre-trained vision-language models, integrated via a novel\nPrior-guided Attention Block (PAB). Within the PAB, latent semantic priors can\npromote content restoration, while degraded representations guide precise color\ncorrection, both particularly in extremely dark regions through the\nmeticulously designed cross-attention fusion mechanism.

Furthermore, existing calligraphic datasets are extremely scarce,\nand most provide only character-level annotations without additional attribute\ninformation. This limitation has significantly hindered the in-depth study of\nChinese calligraphy. To fill this gap, we present a novel Multi-Attribute\nChinese Calligraphy Character Dataset (MCCD). The dataset encompasses 7,765\ncategories with a total of 329,715 isolated image samples of Chinese\ncalligraphy characters, and three additional subsets were extracted based on\nthe attribute labeling of the three types of script styles (10 types),\ndynasties (15 periods) and calligraphers (142 individuals). The rich\nmulti-attribute annotations render MCCD well-suited diverse research tasks,\nincluding calligraphic character recognition, writer identification, and\nevolutionary studies of Chinese characters. We establish benchmark performance\nthrough single-task and multi-task recognition experiments across MCCD and all\nof its subsets.

However, autonomous driving is a data-driven task. Complete\npanoramic data acquisition requires complex sampling systems and annotation\npipelines, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Although existing\nstreet view generation models have demonstrated strong data regeneration\ncapabilities, they can only learn from the fixed data distribution of existing\ndatasets and cannot achieve high-quality, controllable panoramic generation. In\nthis paper, we propose the first panoramic generation method Percep360 for\nautonomous driving. Percep360 enables coherent generation of panoramic data\nwith control signals based on the stitched panoramic data. Percep360 focuses on\ntwo key aspects: coherence and controllability. Specifically, to overcome the\ninherent information loss caused by the pinhole sampling process, we propose\nthe Local Scenes Diffusion Method (LSDM). LSDM reformulates the panorama\ngeneration as a spatially continuous diffusion process, bridging the gaps\nbetween different data distributions. Additionally, to achieve the controllable\ngeneration of panoramic images, we propose a Probabilistic Prompting Method\n(PPM). PPM dynamically selects the most relevant control cues, enabling\ncontrollable panoramic image generation.

To address these challenges, we present a large-scale dataset and\nintroduce a novel framework for multi-modal feature fusion aimed at enhancing\nthe accuracy of survival prediction. The dataset comprises 3D CT images and\ncorresponding clinical records from NSCLC patients treated with immune\ncheckpoint inhibitors (ICI), along with progression-free survival (PFS) and\noverall survival (OS) data. We further propose a cross-modality masked learning\napproach for medical feature fusion, consisting of two distinct branches, each\ntailored to its respective modality: a Slice-Depth Transformer for extracting\n3D features from CT images and a graph-based Transformer for learning node\nfeatures and relationships among clinical variables in tabular data. The fusion\nprocess is guided by a masked modality learning strategy, wherein the model\nutilizes the intact modality to reconstruct missing components. This mechanism\nimproves the integration of modality-specific features, fostering more\neffective inter-modality relationships and feature interactions.

Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification and captioning\nhave become crucial tasks in computer-aided pathology.

To address these issues, we introduce\na novel GNN-ViTCap framework for classification and caption generation from\nhistopathological microscopic images.

We build a graph\nby connecting each node to its nearest neighbors in the similarity matrix and\napply a graph neural network to capture both local and global context. The\naggregated image embeddings are projected into the language model's input space\nthrough a linear layer and combined with caption tokens to fine-tune a large\nlanguage model.

However, in cross-modal\nsettings, conventional distillation methods encounter significant challenges\ndue to data and statistical heterogeneities, failing to leverage the\ncomplementary prior knowledge embedded in cross-modal teacher models. This\npaper empirically reveals two critical issues in existing approaches:\ndistillation path selection and knowledge drift. To address these limitations,\nwe propose MST-Distill, a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework\nfeaturing a mixture of specialized teachers. Our approach employs a diverse\nensemble of teacher models across both cross-modal and multimodal\nconfigurations, integrated with an instance-level routing network that\nfacilitates adaptive and dynamic distillation. This architecture effectively\ntranscends the constraints of traditional methods that rely on monotonous and\nstatic teacher models. Additionally, we introduce a plug-in masking module,\nindependently trained to suppress modality-specific discrepancies and\nreconstruct teacher representations, thereby mitigating knowledge drift and\nenhancing transfer effectiveness. Extensive experiments across five diverse\nmultimodal datasets, spanning visual, audio, and text, demonstrate that our\nmethod significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art knowledge\ndistillation methods in cross-modal distillation tasks.

However, a key limitation is the\nuse of CLIP as the visual encoder; while it can capture coarse global\ninformation, it often can miss fine-grained details that are relevant to the\ninput query. To address these shortcomings, this work studies whether\npre-trained text-to-image diffusion models can serve as instruction-aware\nvisual encoders. Through an analysis of their internal representations, we find\ndiffusion features are both rich in semantics and can encode strong image-text\nalignment. Moreover, we find that we can leverage text conditioning to focus\nthe model on regions relevant to the input question. We then investigate how to\nalign these features with large language models and uncover a leakage\nphenomenon, where the LLM can inadvertently recover information from the\noriginal diffusion prompt. We analyze the causes of this leakage and propose a\nmitigation strategy. Based on these insights, we explore a simple fusion\nstrategy that utilizes both CLIP and conditional diffusion features. We\nevaluate our approach on both general VQA and specialized MLLM benchmarks,\ndemonstrating the promise of diffusion models for visual understanding,\nparticularly in vision-centric tasks that require spatial and compositional\nreasoning.
