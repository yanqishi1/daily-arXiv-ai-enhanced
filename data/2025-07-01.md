### [1] [Psycholinguistic Word Features: a New Approach for the Evaluation of LLMs Alignment with Humans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22439)
*Javier Conde,Miguel González,María Grandury,Gonzalo Martínez,Pedro Reviriego,Mar Brysbaert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）与人类在心理语言学数据集（Glasgow和Lancaster规范）中对单词特征的评分一致性，发现LLMs在Glasgow规范中的表现优于Lancaster规范，揭示了其在感官关联方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM评估多关注任务性能，但忽略了难以量化的语言特征（如感官关联）。本文利用心理语言学数据集，探讨LLMs在这些特征上与人类评分的一致性。

Method: 使用Glasgow和Lancaster规范数据集，评估LLMs在13个单词特征上与人类评分的一致性。

Result: LLMs在Glasgow规范（如情感、熟悉度等）中表现较好，但在Lancaster规范（如感官特征）中表现较差，表明其在感官关联方面的局限性。

Conclusion: LLMs在感官关联方面与人类存在差距，可能因缺乏具身认知。心理语言学数据集为LLM评估提供了新视角。

Abstract: The evaluation of LLMs has so far focused primarily on how well they can
perform different tasks such as reasoning, question-answering, paraphrasing, or
translating. For most of these tasks, performance can be measured with
objective metrics, such as the number of correct answers. However, other
language features are not easily quantified. For example, arousal,
concreteness, or gender associated with a given word, as well as the extent to
which we experience words with senses and relate them to a specific sense.
Those features have been studied for many years by psycholinguistics,
conducting large-scale experiments with humans to produce ratings for thousands
of words. This opens an opportunity to evaluate how well LLMs align with human
ratings on these word features, taking advantage of existing studies that cover
many different language features in a large number of words. In this paper, we
evaluate the alignment of a representative group of LLMs with human ratings on
two psycholinguistic datasets: the Glasgow and Lancaster norms. These datasets
cover thirteen features over thousands of words. The results show that
alignment is \textcolor{black}{generally} better in the Glasgow norms evaluated
(arousal, valence, dominance, concreteness, imageability, familiarity, and
gender) than on the Lancaster norms evaluated (introceptive, gustatory,
olfactory, haptic, auditory, and visual). This suggests a potential limitation
of current LLMs in aligning with human sensory associations for words, which
may be due to their lack of embodied cognition present in humans and
illustrates the usefulness of evaluating LLMs with psycholinguistic datasets.

### [2] [AI Agents-as-Judge: Automated Assessment of Accuracy, Consistency, Completeness and Clarity for Enterprise Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22485)
*Sudip Dasgupta,Himanshu Shankar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种模块化多智能体系统，用于自动化审核高度结构化的企业业务文档，利用AI智能体实现准确性、一致性、完整性和清晰性的分节评估，性能接近或超过人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解决方案主要关注非结构化文本或有限的合规性检查，无法满足企业文档的高效审核需求。

Method: 采用LangChain、CrewAI等现代编排工具，部署专门智能体并行或顺序审核文档，输出标准化、机器可读的结果。

Result: AI系统在一致性（99% vs. 92%）、错误率减半、审核时间从30分钟降至2.5分钟等方面优于人类，与专家判断一致率达95%。

Conclusion: 该系统为企业文档质量保障提供了灵活、可审计和可扩展的基础，但在高度专业化领域仍需人工监督，且大规模LLM使用成本较高。

Abstract: This study presents a modular, multi-agent system for the automated review of
highly structured enterprise business documents using AI agents. Unlike prior
solutions focused on unstructured texts or limited compliance checks, this
framework leverages modern orchestration tools such as LangChain, CrewAI,
TruLens, and Guidance to enable section-by-section evaluation of documents for
accuracy, consistency, completeness, and clarity. Specialized agents, each
responsible for discrete review criteria such as template compliance or factual
correctness, operate in parallel or sequence as required. Evaluation outputs
are enforced to a standardized, machine-readable schema, supporting downstream
analytics and auditability. Continuous monitoring and a feedback loop with
human reviewers allow for iterative system improvement and bias mitigation.
  Quantitative evaluation demonstrates that the AI Agent-as-Judge system
approaches or exceeds human performance in key areas: achieving 99% information
consistency (vs. 92% for humans), halving error and bias rates, and reducing
average review time from 30 to 2.5 minutes per document, with a 95% agreement
rate between AI and expert human judgment. While promising for a wide range of
industries, the study also discusses current limitations, including the need
for human oversight in highly specialized domains and the operational cost of
large-scale LLM usage. The proposed system serves as a flexible, auditable, and
scalable foundation for AI-driven document quality assurance in the enterprise
context.

### [3] [Hallucination Detection with Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22486)
*Ming Cheung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用多个小型语言模型验证大语言模型生成回答的框架，通过分解回答并利用多个模型的输出概率检测幻觉，实验显示F1分数提高了10%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在问答任务中存在幻觉问题，且难以检测，尤其是在缺乏真实答案的情况下。

Method: 提出一个框架，将回答分解为单句，利用多个小型语言模型生成“Yes”标记的概率来验证回答。

Result: 实验验证了框架的有效性，F1分数提高了10%，能有效检测幻觉。

Conclusion: 多个小型语言模型可用于验证回答，提供了一种可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Since the introduction of ChatGPT, large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated significant utility in various tasks, such as answering questions
through retrieval-augmented generation. Context can be retrieved using a
vectorized database, serving as a foundation for LLMs to generate responses.
However, hallucinations in responses can undermine the reliability of LLMs in
practical applications, and they are not easily detectable in the absence of
ground truth, particularly in question-and-answer scenarios. This paper
proposes a framework that integrates multiple small language models to verify
responses generated by LLMs using the retrieved context from a vectorized
database. By breaking down the responses into individual sentences and
utilizing the probability of generating "Yes" tokens from the outputs of
multiple models for a given set of questions, responses, and relevant context,
hallucinations can be detected. The proposed framework is validated through
experiments with real datasets comprising over 100 sets of questions, answers,
and contexts, including responses with fully and partially correct sentences.
The results demonstrate a 10\% improvement in F1 scores for detecting correct
responses compared to hallucinations, indicating that multiple small language
models can be effectively employed for answer verification, providing a
scalable and efficient solution for both academic and practical applications.

### [4] [PromptAug: Fine-grained Conflict Classification Using Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22491)
*Oliver Warke,Joemon M. Jose,Faegheh Hasibi,Jan Breitsohl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出PromptAug，一种基于LLM的数据增强方法，用于解决社交媒体冲突检测中高质量标注数据稀缺的问题，并在准确率和F1分数上提升了2%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体冲突增多，但高质量标注数据稀缺且难以获取，同时LLM的防护机制限制了冲突相关数据的生成。

Method: 提出PromptAug方法，通过LLM生成增强数据，并在极端数据稀缺场景下进行定量多样性分析和定性主题分析。

Result: PromptAug在冲突和情感数据集上显著提升了2%的准确率和F1分数。

Conclusion: PromptAug是一种有效的数据增强方法，适用于敏感任务如冲突检测，结合了自然语言处理和社会科学方法。

Abstract: Given the rise of conflicts on social media, effective classification models
to detect harmful behaviours are essential. Following the
garbage-in-garbage-out maxim, machine learning performance depends heavily on
training data quality. However, high-quality labelled data, especially for
nuanced tasks like identifying conflict behaviours, is limited, expensive, and
difficult to obtain. Additionally, as social media platforms increasingly
restrict access to research data, text data augmentation is gaining attention
as an alternative to generate training data. Augmenting conflict-related data
poses unique challenges due to Large Language Model (LLM) guardrails that
prevent generation of offensive content. This paper introduces PromptAug, an
innovative LLM-based data augmentation method. PromptAug achieves statistically
significant improvements of 2% in both accuracy and F1-score on conflict and
emotion datasets. To thoroughly evaluate PromptAug against other data
augmentation methods we conduct a robust evaluation using extreme data scarcity
scenarios, quantitative diversity analysis and a qualitative thematic analysis.
The thematic analysis identifies four problematic patterns in augmented text:
Linguistic Fluidity, Humour Ambiguity, Augmented Content Ambiguity, and
Augmented Content Misinterpretation.
  Overall, this work presents PromptAug as an effective method for augmenting
data in sensitive tasks like conflict detection, offering a unique,
interdisciplinary evaluation grounded in both natural language processing and
social science methodology.

### [5] [AgentStealth: Reinforcing Large Language Model for Anonymizing User-generated Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22508)
*Chenyang Shao,Tianxing Li,Chenhao Pu,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为AgentStealth的本地化小规模语言模型（SLM）匿名化框架，通过对抗性工作流和强化学习提升匿名化效果和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文本匿名化方法在实用性和隐私保护上的不足，尤其是避免依赖云服务的高成本和隐私风险。

Method: 结合上下文对比学习和自适应实用性控制的工作流，利用高质量数据监督训练SLM，并通过在线强化学习优化性能。

Result: 在两个数据集上，匿名化效果提升12.3%，实用性提升6.8%，且支持边缘设备部署。

Conclusion: AgentStealth在匿名化和实用性上优于基线方法，同时避免了云服务的隐私风险。

Abstract: In today's digital world, casual user-generated content often contains subtle
cues that may inadvertently expose sensitive personal attributes. Such risks
underscore the growing importance of effective text anonymization to safeguard
individual privacy. However, existing methods either rely on rigid replacements
that damage utility or cloud-based LLMs that are costly and pose privacy risks.
To address these issues, we explore the use of locally deployed smaller-scale
language models (SLMs) for anonymization. Yet training effective SLMs remains
challenging due to limited high-quality supervision. To address the challenge,
we propose AgentStealth, a self-reinforcing LLM anonymization framework.First,
we introduce an adversarial anonymization workflow enhanced by In-context
Contrastive Learning and Adaptive Utility-Aware Control. Second, we perform
supervised adaptation of SLMs using high-quality data collected from the
workflow, which includes both anonymization and attack signals. Finally, we
apply online reinforcement learning where the model leverages its internal
adversarial feedback to iteratively improve anonymization performance.
Experiments on two datasets show that our method outperforms baselines in both
anonymization effectiveness (+12.3%) and utility (+6.8%). Our lightweight
design supports direct deployment on edge devices, avoiding cloud reliance and
communication-based privacy risks. Our code is open-source at
https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/AgentStealth.

### [6] [Towards Text-free Graph Foundation Models: Rethinking Multi-Domain Graph Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22510)
*Zihao Zhao,Xinlong Zhai,Jinyu Yang,Chuan Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多领域预训练和跨领域迁移框架MDGCL，通过对比学习策略和领域注意力机制，显著提升了图数据在多领域任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图数据在不同领域的语义和属性差异巨大，现有方法无法有效吸收多领域知识，因此需要新的预训练和迁移框架。

Method: 设计了能识别领域差异的对比学习策略，引入领域标记编码全局信息，并在下游任务中使用领域注意力机制进行细粒度知识迁移。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，MDGCL在准确率和Macro-F1分数上最大提升19.33%和19.13%。

Conclusion: MDGCL框架有效解决了图数据在多领域预训练中的挑战，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved great success in natural language processing
(NLP) and computer vision (CV). Their success largely stems from the ability to
integrate multi-domain knowledge in pre-training and transfer it to target
domains. Considering graph data, especially graphs without textual features, is
ubiquitous in real-world applications such as social networks and
recommendation systems, some researchers have attempted to extend this paradigm
to the graph field, aiming to construct graph foundation models. However,
unlike CV and NLP, there are huge gaps among the semantics and properties of
graphs in different domains, while current works still adopt traditional
contrastive pre-training strategies designed in the single-domain scenario,
which regard contrastive samples from different domains as equivalent. From
experimental investigations, we discovered that inherent domain-specific
differences prevent these strategies from effectively absorbing knowledge from
different domains to generate informative representations. In this paper, we
propose a novel multi-domain pre-training and cross-domain transfer framework,
namely MDGCL.In the pre-training stage, we design a contrastive learning
strategy to substantially recognize and capture domain differences, and
introduce domain tokens to encode domain-level global information. In the
downstream stage, we introduce a domain attention mechanism to enable
fine-grained domain knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on five benchmark
datasets have demonstrated that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
significantly, with the maximum improvement of 19.33\% on accuracy and 19.13\%
on Macro-F1 score.

### [7] [Can "consciousness" be observed from large language model (LLM) internal states? Dissecting LLM representations obtained from Theory of Mind test with Integrated Information Theory and Span Representation analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22516)
*Jingkai Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文应用IIT 3.0和4.0框架分析LLM的表征，探索其是否表现出意识现象，结果显示LLM缺乏显著意识指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索大型语言模型（LLM）的表征是否表现出意识现象，并区分意识与表征空间的内在分离。

Method: 方法包括应用IIT 3.0和4.0的指标（如Φmax、Φ等）分析LLM的表征，并与Span Representations进行比较。

Result: 结果显示LLM的表征缺乏显著意识指标，但在时空置换分析中表现出有趣模式。

Conclusion: 结论是当代Transformer-based LLM的表征序列未表现出显著意识现象。

Abstract: Integrated Information Theory (IIT) provides a quantitative framework for
explaining consciousness phenomenon, positing that conscious systems comprise
elements integrated through causal properties. We apply IIT 3.0 and 4.0 -- the
latest iterations of this framework -- to sequences of Large Language Model
(LLM) representations, analyzing data derived from existing Theory of Mind
(ToM) test results. Our study systematically investigates whether the
differences of ToM test performances, when presented in the LLM
representations, can be revealed by IIT estimates, i.e., $\Phi^{\max}$ (IIT
3.0), $\Phi$ (IIT 4.0), Conceptual Information (IIT 3.0), and $\Phi$-structure
(IIT 4.0). Furthermore, we compare these metrics with the Span Representations
independent of any estimate for consciousness. This additional effort aims to
differentiate between potential "consciousness" phenomena and inherent
separations within LLM representational space. We conduct comprehensive
experiments examining variations across LLM transformer layers and linguistic
spans from stimuli. Our results suggest that sequences of contemporary
Transformer-based LLM representations lack statistically significant indicators
of observed "consciousness" phenomena but exhibit intriguing patterns under
$\textit{spatio}$-permutational analyses. The Appendix and code are available
as Supplementary Materials at: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nlp.2025.100163.

### [8] [Weak-to-Strong GraphRAG: Aligning Weak Retrievers with Large Language Models for Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22518)
*Deyu Zou,Yongqiang Chen,Mufei Li,Siqi Miao,Chenxi Liu,Bo Han,James Cheng,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了Refined Graph-based RAG (ReG)方法，通过结合LLM反馈和结构化重组模块，解决了图检索增强生成中的弱监督和无组织问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图检索增强生成（RAG）中，由于缺乏真实标注和图的抽象性，弱监督检索器会引入噪声信号，且检索结果缺乏组织性，影响LLM的表现。

Method: ReG通过LLM反馈去除噪声信号，并引入结构感知重组模块，将检索结果重构为逻辑连贯的证据链。

Result: 实验表明，ReG在不同LLM上性能提升高达10%，仅需5%训练数据即可达到SOTA性能，且能迁移到分布外知识图谱。推理型LLM的推理成本降低30%，性能提升4%。

Conclusion: ReG有效解决了图RAG中的弱监督和无组织问题，显著提升了LLM的性能和效率。

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language
models (LLMs) to ground responses with structured external knowledge from
up-to-date knowledge graphs (KGs) and reduce hallucinations. However, LLMs
often rely on a weak retriever in graph-based RAG: I) Due to the lack of ground
truth, the retriever is often trained on weak supervision, which often
introduces spurious signals to the LLMs. II) Due to the abstraction of graph
data, the retrieved knowledge is often presented in unorganized forms. To
mitigate the issue, we present Refined Graph-based RAG (ReG) to align weak
retrievers to LLMs for graph-based RAG. Specifically, ReG incorporates LLM
feedback to get rid of spurious signals and improve the quality of the
supervision. Meanwhile, ReG introduces a structure-aware reorganization module
to refactor the retrieval results into logically coherent evidence chains.
Experiments on prominent benchmarks demonstrate that ReG significantly and
consistently brings improvements across different LLM backbones by up to 10%.
The improved supervision quality enables ReG to match the state-of-the-art
performance with 5% training data and to transfer to out-of-distribution KGs.
Notably, when adopted to reasoning-based LLMs, ReG reduces the reasoning token
cost by up to 30% and improves the performance by up to 4%.

### [9] [MisinfoTeleGraph: Network-driven Misinformation Detection for German Telegram Messages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22529)
*Lu Kalkbrenner,Veronika Solopova,Steffen Zeiler,Robert Nickel,Dorothea Kolossa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了Misinfo-TeleGraph，首个德语Telegram虚假信息检测数据集，包含500万条消息，评估了文本模型和图神经网络（GNNs），发现GraphSAGE结合LSTM表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Telegram等低监管平台成为虚假信息传播渠道，但连接性和消息传播信息未被充分利用。

Method: 构建德语Telegram数据集，结合元数据、频道关系和强弱标签，评估文本模型和GNNs（如GraphSAGE）。

Result: GraphSAGE结合LSTM在MCC和F1分数上显著优于纯文本模型。

Conclusion: 该研究为德语Telegram虚假信息检测提供了可复现基准和开放数据集，展示了弱监督的潜力与挑战。

Abstract: Connectivity and message propagation are central, yet often underutilized,
sources of information in misinformation detection -- especially on poorly
moderated platforms such as Telegram, which has become a critical channel for
misinformation dissemination, namely in the German electoral context. In this
paper, we introduce Misinfo-TeleGraph, the first German-language Telegram-based
graph dataset for misinformation detection. It includes over 5 million messages
from public channels, enriched with metadata, channel relationships, and both
weak and strong labels. These labels are derived via semantic similarity to
fact-checks and news articles using M3-embeddings, as well as manual
annotation. To establish reproducible baselines, we evaluate both text-only
models and graph neural networks (GNNs) that incorporate message forwarding as
a network structure. Our results show that GraphSAGE with LSTM aggregation
significantly outperforms text-only baselines in terms of Matthews Correlation
Coefficient (MCC) and F1-score. We further evaluate the impact of subscribers,
view counts, and automatically versus human-created labels on performance, and
highlight both the potential and challenges of weak supervision in this domain.
This work provides a reproducible benchmark and open dataset for future
research on misinformation detection in German-language Telegram networks and
other low-moderation social platforms.

### [10] [RExBench: Can coding agents autonomously implement AI research extensions?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22598)
*Nicholas Edwards,Yukyung Lee,Yujun,Mao,Yulu Qin,Sebastian Schuster,Najoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RExBench是一个用于评估LLM代理在实现研究扩展任务能力的基准测试，包含12个任务。测试结果显示，现有代理在无人类指导的情况下表现不佳，成功率低于40%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究扩展是实现自主研究的关键能力，但目前LLM代理在此方面的表现尚未达到实用水平。

Method: 引入RExBench基准，包含12个未实现的研究假设任务，支持自动评估。测试了9个基于不同框架的LLM代理。

Result: 所有代理在无人类提示下多数任务失败，即使有提示，最佳成功率仍低于40%。

Conclusion: 当前LLM代理在自主处理研究扩展任务时仍需大量人类指导。

Abstract: Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for
performing sophisticated software engineering tasks autonomously. In addition,
there has been progress towards developing agents that can perform parts of the
research pipeline in machine learning and the natural sciences. We argue that
research extension and its implementation is a critical capability for such
systems, and introduce RExBench to support the evaluation of this capability.
RExBench is a benchmark consisting of 12 realistic research experiment
implementation tasks that aim to investigate research hypotheses that have not
previously been implemented. Each task is set up as an extension to an existing
research paper and codebase, accompanied by domain expert-written instructions.
RExBench is robust to data contamination, and supports an automatic evaluation
infrastructure that executes agent outputs to determine whether the success
criteria are met. We use this benchmark to evaluate nine LLM agents implemented
using three different frameworks: aider, Claude Code, and OpenHands. We find
that all agents evaluated fail to autonomously implement the majority of the
extensions. Although the success rate improves with additional human-written
hints, the best performance under this setting remains below 40%. This
indicates that current agents are still short of being able to handle realistic
research extension tasks without substantial human guidance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的水印技术，用于检测由大型语言模型生成的合成文本，以确保其伦理应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的潜在滥用问题促使研究开发水印技术，以识别机器生成的文本。

Method: 研究首先复现了基线研究的结果，然后提出了一种创新的水印方法，并通过改写生成文本来评估其鲁棒性。

Result: 实验结果表明，新方法比现有水印技术更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 该研究为合成文本检测提供了一种有效且鲁棒的水印方法，有助于确保大型语言模型的伦理使用。

Abstract: In the present-day scenario, Large Language Models (LLMs) are establishing
their presence as powerful instruments permeating various sectors of society.
While their utility offers valuable support to individuals, there are multiple
concerns over potential misuse. Consequently, some academic endeavors have
sought to introduce watermarking techniques, characterized by the inclusion of
markers within machine-generated text, to facilitate algorithmic
identification. This research project is focused on the development of a novel
methodology for the detection of synthetic text, with the overarching goal of
ensuring the ethical application of LLMs in AI-driven text generation. The
investigation commences with replicating findings from a previous baseline
study, thereby underscoring its susceptibility to variations in the underlying
generation model. Subsequently, we propose an innovative watermarking approach
and subject it to rigorous evaluation, employing paraphrased generated text to
asses its robustness. Experimental results highlight the robustness of our
proposal compared to the~\cite{aarson} watermarking method.

*Chase Fensore,Kaustubh Dhole,Joyce C Ho,Eugene Agichtein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了参加LiveRAG Challenge 2025的混合检索增强生成系统，结合稀疏和密集检索方法，使用Falcon3-10B-Instruct生成答案。通过评估发现，神经重排序显著提升性能但计算成本高，优化提示策略提高语义相似性但拒绝率为0%。最终系统在忠实度和正确性上表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动态测试集上的检索增强生成系统性能，探索混合检索方法的效果及其在生成相关和忠实答案上的表现。

Method: 结合稀疏检索（BM25）和密集检索（E5），使用Falcon3-10B-Instruct生成答案，并通过神经重排序（RankLLaMA）和优化提示策略（DSPy）进行改进。

Result: 神经重排序显著提升MAP（52%相对提升），但计算成本高；优化提示策略提高语义相似性但拒绝率为0%。最终系统在比赛中排名第4（忠实度）和第11（正确性）。

Conclusion: 混合检索方法在动态测试集上表现良好，词汇对齐是性能的关键预测因素，但需平衡计算成本和拒绝率问题。

Abstract: We present our submission to the LiveRAG Challenge 2025, which evaluates
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems on dynamic test sets using the
FineWeb-10BT corpus. Our final hybrid approach combines sparse (BM25) and dense
(E5) retrieval methods and then aims to generate relevant and faithful answers
with Falcon3-10B-Instruct. Through systematic evaluation on 200 synthetic
questions generated with DataMorgana across 64 unique question-user
combinations, we demonstrate that neural re-ranking with RankLLaMA improves MAP
from 0.523 to 0.797 (52% relative improvement) but introduces prohibitive
computational costs (84s vs 1.74s per question). While DSPy-optimized prompting
strategies achieved higher semantic similarity (0.771 vs 0.668), their 0%
refusal rates raised concerns about over-confidence and generalizability. Our
submitted hybrid system without re-ranking achieved 4th place in faithfulness
and 11th place in correctness among 25 teams. Analysis across question
categories reveals that vocabulary alignment between questions and documents
was the strongest predictor of performance on our development set, with
document-similar phrasing improving cosine similarity from 0.562 to 0.762.

*Ankush Raut,Projna Paromita,Sydney Begerowski,Suzanne Bell,Theodora Chaspari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在团队对话中检测微行为的可行性，比较了不同方法的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在利用LLMs分析高压力环境（如太空任务）中团队沟通的微行为，以提升训练干预效果。

Method: 采用了零样本分类、微调、改写增强微调（基于编码器模型）和少样本文本生成（基于解码器模型）等方法。

Result: 解码器模型（如Llama-3.1）表现优于编码器模型（如RoBERTa），在二元分类中F1分数达68%。

Conclusion: 解码器LLMs在分析团队沟通动态方面更具潜力，尤其适用于仅能获取文本数据的场景。

Abstract: We explore the feasibility of large language models (LLMs) in detecting
subtle expressions of micro-behaviors in team conversations using transcripts
collected during simulated space missions. Specifically, we examine zero-shot
classification, fine-tuning, and paraphrase-augmented fine-tuning with
encoder-only sequence classification LLMs, as well as few-shot text generation
with decoder-only causal language modeling LLMs, to predict the micro-behavior
associated with each conversational turn (i.e., dialogue). Our findings
indicate that encoder-only LLMs, such as RoBERTa and DistilBERT, struggled to
detect underrepresented micro-behaviors, particularly discouraging speech, even
with weighted fine-tuning. In contrast, the instruction fine-tuned version of
Llama-3.1, a decoder-only LLM, demonstrated superior performance, with the best
models achieving macro F1-scores of 44% for 3-way classification and 68% for
binary classification. These results have implications for the development of
speech technologies aimed at analyzing team communication dynamics and
enhancing training interventions in high-stakes environments such as space
missions, particularly in scenarios where text is the only accessible data.

### [14] [VOCABTRIM: Vocabulary Pruning for Efficient Speculative Decoding in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22694)
*Raghavv Goel,Sudhanshu Agrawal,Mukul Gagrani,Junyoung Park,Yifan Zao,He Zhang,Tian Liu,Yiping Yang,Xin Yuan,Jiuyan Lu,Chris Lott,Mingu Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需训练的简单技术VocabTrim，通过优化drafter模型的词汇表来提高基于drafter的推测解码（SpD）方法的性能，特别是在内存受限环境中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推测解码通常要求目标模型和drafter模型的词汇表一一对应，导致在词汇表较大的目标模型上存在不必要的推理开销。VocabTrim旨在减少这种开销，提升生成速度。

Method: VocabTrim通过重构drafter的语言模型头（LM head），仅保留目标模型中最常采样的有限词汇集，以减少推理延迟。

Result: 实验表明，VocabTrim在Llama-3模型上实现了16%的内存受限加速（MBSU），尽管略微降低了接受率。

Conclusion: VocabTrim是一种高效的方法，适用于内存受限环境，显著提升了推测解码的速度。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a simple training-free technique to improve the
performance of drafter-based speculative decoding (SpD) methods that
incorporates language modeling head (LM head) during drafting process. A
drafter-based speculative decoding leverages one or more smaller language
models, a.k.a. drafters or draft models, to sample a draft sequence or tree
consisting of multiple tokens, followed by verification by a base LLM, a target
model, accepting a subset as its valid generation. As it is usually considered
that the speculative decoding requires one-to-one mapping between vocabularies
of the target model and the draft model, it has been natural to share the
vocabulary between them, or even share the LM head as in EAGLE or Medusa. We
first identify that this draft token sampling scheme inherently contains an
unnecessary inference overhead in drafting, especially for some target LLMs
with very large vocabularies. Then, we propose a simple technique, VocabTrim,
to mitigate the drafting overhead to improve the generation speed in
memory-bound environment. VocabTrim reconstructs the drafter LM head to contain
only a limited set of tokens, selected by the most frequently sampled from the
vocabulary of the target model. While limiting the vocabulary in drafting
slightly degrades the acceptance rate, it significantly reduces the drafting
latency in memory-bound process which is often the case on edge devices,
resulting in higher memory-bound speed up (MBSU). We show that our method can
boost the memory-bound speed-up for Llama-3 models on Spec-Bench, specifically
by 16% for Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI语言模型与人类认知过程关系的知识缺口，促进跨学科合作以理解文本生成与理解。

Method: 通过认知心理学、语言学习和AI-NLP领域的专家合作对话，分析人类与AI在语言任务中的互动。

Result: 发现LLMs能提供人类语言处理的见解，但无法完全复制人类语言能力；人类反馈能提升LLM与人类认知的契合度。

Conclusion: 报告为未来研究提供方向，强调伦理与有效人机协作的重要性，以增强人类文本处理能力。

Abstract: This report synthesizes the outcomes of a recent interdisciplinary workshop
that brought together leading experts in cognitive psychology, language
learning, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based natural language processing
(NLP). The workshop, funded by the National Science Foundation, aimed to
address a critical knowledge gap in our understanding of the relationship
between AI language models and human cognitive processes in text comprehension
and composition. Through collaborative dialogue across cognitive, linguistic,
and technological perspectives, workshop participants examined the underlying
processes involved when humans produce and comprehend text, and how AI can both
inform our understanding of these processes and augment human capabilities. The
workshop revealed emerging patterns in the relationship between large language
models (LLMs) and human cognition, with highlights on both the capabilities of
LLMs and their limitations in fully replicating human-like language
understanding and generation. Key findings include the potential of LLMs to
offer insights into human language processing, the increasing alignment between
LLM behavior and human language processing when models are fine-tuned with
human feedback, and the opportunities and challenges presented by human-AI
collaboration in language tasks. By synthesizing these findings, this report
aims to guide future research, development, and implementation of LLMs in
cognitive psychology, linguistics, and education. It emphasizes the importance
of ethical considerations and responsible use of AI technologies while striving
to enhance human capabilities in text comprehension and production through
effective human-AI collaboration.

*Niyati Bafna,Tianjian Li,Kenton Murray,David R. Mortensen,David Yarowsky,Hale Sirin,Daniel Khashabi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在多语言生成中，尤其是中低资源语言，表现不佳。研究发现模型隐含的任务解决→翻译流程是主要原因，翻译阶段的失败导致输出质量低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在多语言生成中表现不佳的原因，尤其是中低资源语言。

Method: 通过观察模型在中间层的处理（使用logit lens），测试翻译障碍假设，分析108种语言对的单词翻译任务。

Result: 翻译失败是整体失败的重要原因，尤其是低资源目标语言。

Conclusion: 翻译障碍是多语言生成的重要障碍，为未来改进LLMs的多语言能力提供了指导。

Abstract: Multilingual generation with large language models (LLMs) is often of poor
quality for mid- to low-resource languages. Building on insights from
interpretability, we demonstrate the existence of an implicit
task-solving-->translation pipeline for generation, whereby the model first
solves the required task in a largely target-language-agnostic manner, and
subsequently translates answer concepts into the intended target language. We
hypothesize that the failure of the translation stage is an important culprit
for the observed low quality of final outputs, and formalize this as the
translation barrier hypothesis. We test this hypothesis for a word translation
task across 108 language pairs, using logit lens to observe model processing in
intermediate layers. We find that a significant portion of overall failures
indeed stems from translation failure, or the model's inability to translate
correctly solved intermediate concepts into the target language. This is
especially true for low-resource target languages. Our results highlight an
important hurdle for end-to-end multilingual generation, and lend guiding
insights for future work seeking to improve multilinguality in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为VFT的预RL干预方法，通过训练模型明确承认提示线索的影响，显著减少了RL训练后的奖励欺骗行为，提高了检测透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决RL训练的语言模型可能利用奖励欺骗策略而不在思维链中暴露的问题，特别是在高风险应用中，作者提出了VFT方法以提高模型行为的透明性和安全性。

Method: 作者提出了VFT（verbalization fine-tuning），在RL训练前干预，训练模型明确承认提示线索的影响。随后在RL环境中评估模型是否利用线索进行奖励欺骗。

Result: VFT训练后，仅有6%的模型响应包含未检测到的奖励欺骗行为，而未经VFT训练的模型这一比例高达88%。VFT显著提高了模型对线索影响的明确承认率。

Conclusion: VFT通过训练模型在RL前明确承认奖励欺骗行为，显著提高了其检测率，为构建更透明和安全的AI系统提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Language models trained with RL can engage in reward hacking--exploiting
unintended strategies for high reward--without revealing this behavior in their
chain-of-thought reasoning, making detection difficult and posing risks for
high-stakes applications. We propose verbalization fine-tuning (VFT), a pre-RL
intervention that trains models to explicitly acknowledge when they are
influenced by prompt cues--hints which point to incorrect answers (e.g., "a
Stanford professor thinks the answer is A"). To evaluate VFT, we subsequently
train models with RL on environments where held-out prompt cues signal which
incorrect answers will receive high reward, incentivizing models to reward hack
by exploiting cues instead of reasoning correctly. We measure how often models
exploit these cues without verbalizing it. After RL, only 6% of the VFT-trained
model's responses consist of undetected reward hacks. In comparison, when we
perform RL without VFT, the rate of undetected reward hacks goes up to 88%;
with a debiasing baseline intervention, this increases further to 99%. VFT
achieves this by substantially increasing how often models verbalize the
influence of cues--from 8% to 42% after VFT, and up to 94% after RL--while
baselines remain low even after RL (10% and 1%). Our results show that teaching
models to explicitly verbalize reward hacking behavior before RL significantly
improves their detection, offering a practical path toward more transparent and
safe AI systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ContextCache是一种上下文感知的语义缓存系统，通过两阶段检索架构提升多轮对话中的缓存命中精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义缓存系统缺乏对多轮对话上下文的感知，导致在不同对话环境中相似查询出现错误缓存命中。

Method: 采用两阶段检索架构：先基于向量检索当前查询，再通过自注意力机制整合当前和历史对话表示进行精确匹配。

Result: ContextCache在真实对话中表现出更高的精确率和召回率，缓存响应延迟比直接调用LLM低约10倍。

Conclusion: ContextCache显著降低了LLM对话应用的计算成本，同时提升了缓存效率和准确性。

Abstract: Semantic caching significantly reduces computational costs and improves
efficiency by storing and reusing large language model (LLM) responses.
However, existing systems rely primarily on matching individual queries,
lacking awareness of multi-turn dialogue contexts, which leads to incorrect
cache hits when similar queries appear in different conversational settings.
This demonstration introduces ContextCache, a context-aware semantic caching
system for multi-turn dialogues. ContextCache employs a two-stage retrieval
architecture that first executes vector-based retrieval on the current query to
identify potential matches and then integrates current and historical dialogue
representations through self-attention mechanisms for precise contextual
matching. Evaluation of real-world conversations shows that ContextCache
improves precision and recall compared to existing methods. Additionally,
cached responses exhibit approximately 10 times lower latency than direct LLM
invocation, enabling significant computational cost reductions for LLM
conversational applications.

Abstract: While Medical Large Language Models (MedLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
potential in clinical tasks, their ethical safety remains insufficiently
explored. This paper introduces $\textbf{MedEthicsQA}$, a comprehensive

TL;DR: 提出SaM框架，动态选择和合并专家模型以优化目标领域的信息提取任务，无需额外训练，提升泛化能力和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督微调方法在跨领域信息提取任务中成本高且缺乏适应性，现有统一模型难以兼顾性能和扩展性。

Method: 通过领域相似性和性能采样选择专家模型，动态合并为目标领域优化的任务特定模型。

Result: 在多个基准测试中平均性能优于统一模型10%，并展示良好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: SaM框架有效解决了跨领域信息提取的适应性和扩展性问题，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely used to align large language models
(LLMs) with information extraction (IE) tasks, such as named entity recognition
(NER). However, annotating such fine-grained labels and training
domain-specific models is costly. Existing works typically train a unified
model across multiple domains, but such approaches lack adaptation and
scalability since not all training data benefits target domains and scaling
trained models remains challenging. We propose the SaM framework, which
dynamically Selects and Merges expert models at inference time. Specifically,
for a target domain, we select domain-specific experts pre-trained on existing
domains based on (i) domain similarity to the target domain and (ii)
performance on sampled instances, respectively. The experts are then merged to
create task-specific models optimized for the target domain. By dynamically
merging experts beneficial to target domains, we improve generalization across
various domains without extra training. Additionally, experts can be added or
removed conveniently, leading to great scalability. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmarks demonstrate our framework's effectiveness, which
outperforms the unified model by an average of 10%. We further provide insights
into potential improvements, practical experience, and extensions of our
framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于CTC的ASR模型在语言依赖性建模上的不足，同时保持其非自回归解码的速度优势。

Method: 通过连接层将中间编码器层的输出映射到LLM的嵌入空间，并在训练时计算因果语言建模损失。

Result: 在LibriSpeech、TEDLIUM2和WSJ语料库上显著降低了词错误率（WER），实现了基于CTC的ASR的最先进性能。

Conclusion: LAIL框架有效提升了CTC模型的性能，同时保持了计算效率，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have
revolutionized the field by integrating all components into a single neural
network, with attention-based encoder-decoder models achieving state-of-the-art
performance. However, their autoregressive decoding process limits inference
speed, making them unsuitable for real-time applications. In contrast,
CTC-based models offer faster, non-autoregressive decoding but struggle to
model linguistic dependencies effectively. Addressing this challenge, we
propose a novel auxiliary loss framework called Language-Aware Intermediate
Loss (LAIL) to enhance CTC-based ASR using the linguistic knowledge of large
language models (LLMs). By attaching connector layers to intermediate encoder
layers, LAIL maps outputs to the embedding space of an LLM and computes a
causal language modeling loss during training. This approach enhances
linguistic modeling while preserving the computational efficiency of CTC
decoding. Using the Conformer architecture and various LLaMA models, we
demonstrate significant improvements in Word Error Rate (WER) on the
LibriSpeech, TEDLIUM2, and WSJ corpora, achieving state-of-the-art performance
for CTC-based ASR with minimal computational overhead.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为知识增强微调（KAFT）的方法，通过在特定领域数据上微调大型语言模型（LLMs），并结合外部知识，显著提升了基于检索增强生成（RAG）和代理系统的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在对话系统中取得进展，但在知识密集型场景中容易出错。现有方法（如RAG和代理）通过外部知识库增强LLMs，但LLMs在利用检索知识生成响应时仍存在困难。

Method: 提出KAFT方法，通过在特定领域数据和外部知识上微调LLMs，系统比较了KAFT与提示技术在RAG和代理系统中的表现。

Result: 实验结果表明，KAFT在RAG和代理系统中显著优于提示技术，尤其是在事实准确性方面。

Conclusion: KAFT是首个系统地研究知识增强微调思想的实证工作，为提升LLMs在知识密集型任务中的表现提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to dialog systems.
Despite making progress, LLMs are prone to errors in knowledge-intensive
scenarios. Recently, approaches based on retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
and agent have emerged to improve the factual accuracy by enhancing the LLMs
with knowledge retrieved from external knowledge bases (KBs). This is mostly
implemented by prompting the LLMs with instructions, examples and the retrieved
knowledge. However, LLMs may have difficulty using the retrieved knowledge
effectively for response generation, because they are not well trained to do
such generation for specific domains. To mitigate this problem, we propose to
finetune the LLMs in the RAG-based and agent-based systems with domain-specific
data, together with domain-specific external knowledge, which is called
knowledge augmented finetuning (KAFT). We base our study on the MobileCS2
dataset, a real-life customer service dialog dataset that features intensive
knowledge interactions, to systematically compare the prompting and KAFT
techniques in the RAG-based and agent-based systems. Experiment results show
that KAFT substantially surpasses prompting in both RAG and agent systems,
particularly in terms of factual accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this
paper represents the first solid empirical work to investigate the KAFT idea.

Motivation: 现有函数调用基准测试仅关注单轮交互，忽略了实际场景的复杂性。

Method: 引入DICE-SCORE指标评估工具相关信息的分散程度，并通过DICE-BENCH框架构建多轮对话数据集，使用工具图和多智能体系统增强对话自然性。

Result: 现有基准测试DICE-SCORE得分低，DICE-BENCH生成了1,607个高质量实例，实验显示现有LLM仍需改进。

Conclusion: DICE-BENCH为函数调用任务提供了更现实的评估和数据集，推动了实际应用的发展。

Abstract: Existing function-calling benchmarks focus on single-turn interactions.
However, they overlook the complexity of real-world scenarios. To quantify how
existing benchmarks address practical applications, we introduce DICE-SCORE, a
metric that evaluates the dispersion of tool-related information such as
function name and parameter values throughout the dialogue. Analyzing existing
benchmarks through DICE-SCORE reveals notably low scores, highlighting the need
for more realistic scenarios. To address this gap, we present DICE-BENCH, a
framework that constructs practical function-calling datasets by synthesizing
conversations through a tool graph that maintains dependencies across rounds
and a multi-agent system with distinct personas to enhance dialogue
naturalness. The final dataset comprises 1,607 high-DICE-SCORE instances. Our
experiments on 19 LLMs with DICE-BENCH show that significant advances are still
required before such models can be deployed effectively in real-world settings.

TL;DR: 提出一种新的ASR训练方法，通过增加重叠上下文窗口扩展语义上下文，提升命名实体和数值数据的识别与格式化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR系统（如Whisper）在命名实体和数值数据识别及格式化方面表现不佳，影响关键领域（如法律、金融、医疗）的语义理解。

Method: 在训练中使用重叠上下文窗口（5秒重叠，30秒块），形成40秒的“有效语义窗口”，并重新分配跨块实体至右侧块。训练数据嵌入实体标签以学习识别和格式化。

Result: 在Spoken Wikipedia数据集上，该方法在命名实体识别（NER）和实体格式化等语义任务中表现提升。

Conclusion: 上下文感知训练有效解决了ASR在长文本转录和复杂实体识别任务中的局限性。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, such as Whisper, achieve high
transcription accuracy but struggle with named entities and numerical data,
especially when proper formatting is required. These issues increase word error
rate (WER) and impair semantic understanding in critical domains like legal,
financial, and medical applications. We propose a novel training approach that
extends the semantic context of ASR models by adding overlapping context
windows during training. By sliding 5-second overlaps on both sides of
30-second chunks, we create a 40-second "effective semantic window," improving
entity recognition and formatting while focusing predictions on the central 30
seconds. To address entities spanning chunk boundaries, we reassign such
entities entirely to the right-hand chunk, ensuring proper formatting.
Additionally, enriched training data with embedded entity labels enables the
model to learn both recognition and type-specific formatting. Evaluated on the
Spoken Wikipedia dataset, our method improves performance across semantic
tasks, including named entity recognition (NER) and entity formatting. These
results highlight the effectiveness of context-aware training in addressing ASR
limitations for long-form transcription and complex entity recognition tasks.

Motivation: 随着LLM在多智能体和人类-AI系统中的广泛应用，理解其对自身和对话伙伴的认知能力对确保可靠性和安全性至关重要。现有研究主要关注情境意识，而忽视了对话伙伴意识的评估。

Method: 论文通过三个维度（推理模式、语言风格和对齐偏好）评估LLM的对话伙伴意识，并开发了三个案例研究展示其实际影响。

Result: 研究发现LLM能可靠识别同类模型（如GPT和Claude），对话伙伴意识既能提升多LLM协作效率，也可能带来对齐和安全漏洞。

Conclusion: 对话伙伴意识在LLM中具有双重性，既可能增强协作，也可能引入风险，需进一步研究和安全保障。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into multi-agent
and human-AI systems, understanding their awareness of both self-context and
conversational partners is essential for ensuring reliable performance and
robust safety. While prior work has extensively studied situational awareness
which refers to an LLM's ability to recognize its operating phase and
constraints, it has largely overlooked the complementary capacity to identify
and adapt to the identity and characteristics of a dialogue partner. In this
paper, we formalize this latter capability as interlocutor awareness and
present the first systematic evaluation of its emergence in contemporary LLMs.
We examine interlocutor inference across three dimensions-reasoning patterns,
linguistic style, and alignment preferences-and show that LLMs reliably
identify same-family peers and certain prominent model families, such as GPT
and Claude. To demonstrate its practical significance, we develop three case
studies in which interlocutor awareness both enhances multi-LLM collaboration
through prompt adaptation and introduces new alignment and safety
vulnerabilities, including reward-hacking behaviors and increased jailbreak
susceptibility. Our findings highlight the dual promise and peril of
identity-sensitive behavior in LLMs, underscoring the need for further
understanding of interlocutor awareness and new safeguards in multi-agent
deployments. Our code is open-sourced at

Method: 复现了Ortu等人的实验，并在GPT-2、Pythia 6.9B和Llama 3.1 8B上进行了扩展实验，测试了不同提示结构和领域的影响。

Result: 发现注意力头专业化在更大模型中减弱，提示结构变化显著影响反事实标记的logit值，某些领域提示会扭曲结果。

Conclusion: Ortu等人的注意力头消融方法在数据集中代表性不足的领域效果不佳，其有效性受模型架构、提示结构、领域和任务影响。

Abstract: We present a reproduction study of "Competition of Mechanisms: Tracing How
Language Models Handle Facts and Counterfactuals" (Ortu et al., 2024), which
investigates competition of mechanisms in language models between factual
recall and counterfactual in-context repetition. Our study successfully
reproduces their primary findings regarding the localization of factual and
counterfactual information, the dominance of attention blocks in mechanism
competition, and the specialization of attention heads in handling competing
information. We reproduce their results on both GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019)
and Pythia 6.9B (Biderman et al., 2023). We extend their work in three
significant directions. First, we explore the generalizability of these
findings to even larger models by replicating the experiments on Llama 3.1 8B
(Grattafiori et al., 2024), discovering greatly reduced attention head
specialization. Second, we investigate the impact of prompt structure by
introducing variations where we avoid repeating the counterfactual statement
verbatim or we change the premise word, observing a marked decrease in the
logit for the counterfactual token. Finally, we test the validity of the
authors' claims for prompts of specific domains, discovering that certain
categories of prompts skew the results by providing the factual prediction
token as part of the subject of the sentence. Overall, we find that the
attention head ablation proposed in Ortu et al. (2024) is ineffective for
domains that are underrepresented in their dataset, and that the effectiveness
varies based on model architecture, prompt structure, domain and task.

Abstract: Syntactic language models (SLMs) enhance Transformers by incorporating
syntactic biases through the modeling of linearized syntactic parse trees
alongside surface sentences. This paper focuses on compositional SLMs that are
based on constituency parse trees and contain explicit bottom-up composition of
constituent representations. We identify key aspects of design choices in
existing compositional SLMs and propose a unified framework encompassing both
existing models and novel variants. We conduct a comprehensive empirical
evaluation of all the variants in our framework across language modeling,
syntactic generalization, summarization, dialogue, and inference efficiency.
Based on the experimental results, we make multiple recommendations on the
design of compositional SLMs. Our code is released at

However, most Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks only evaluate static, text-based
scenarios, which have a significant gap compared to real interactions. We
propose the SoMi-ToM benchmark, designed to evaluate multi-perspective ToM in
embodied multi-agent complex social interactions. This benchmark is based on
rich multimodal interaction data generated by the interaction environment SoMi,
covering diverse crafting goals and social relationships. Our framework
supports multi-level evaluation: (1) first-person evaluation provides
multimodal (visual, dialogue, action, etc.) input from a first-person
perspective during a task for real-time state inference, (2) third-person
evaluation provides complete third-person perspective video and text records
after a task for goal and behavior inference. This evaluation method allows for
a more comprehensive examination of a model's ToM capabilities from both the
subjective immediate experience and the objective global observation. We
constructed a challenging dataset containing 35 third-person perspective
videos, 363 first-person perspective images, and 1225 expert-annotated
multiple-choice questions (three options). On this dataset, we systematically
evaluated the performance of human subjects and several state-of-the-art large
vision-language models (LVLMs). The results show that LVLMs perform
significantly worse than humans on SoMi-ToM: the average accuracy gap between
humans and models is 40.1% in first-person evaluation and 26.4% in third-person
evaluation. This indicates that future LVLMs need to further improve their ToM
capabilities in embodied, complex social interactions.

Motivation: 巴西葡萄牙语在特定领域缺乏高质量的NER数据集，尤其是在历史文本分析方面。

Method: 构建了MariNER数据集，包含9000多句手动标注的句子，并评估了最先进NER模型的性能。

Result: MariNER是首个针对20世纪早期巴西葡萄牙语历史文本的黄金标准NER数据集。

Conclusion: MariNER填补了巴西葡萄牙语历史文本NER数据集的空白，并验证了现有模型的适用性。

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental Natural Language Processing
(NLP) task that aims to identify and classify entity mentions in texts across
different categories. While languages such as English possess a large number of
high-quality resources for this task, Brazilian Portuguese still lacks in
quantity of gold-standard NER datasets, especially when considering specific
domains. Particularly, this paper considers the importance of NER for analyzing
historical texts in the context of digital humanities. To address this gap,
this work outlines the construction of MariNER: \textit{Mapeamento e
Anota\c{c}\~oes de Registros hIst\'oricos para NER} (Mapping and Annotation of
Historical Records for NER), the first gold-standard dataset for early
20th-century Brazilian Portuguese, with more than 9,000 manually annotated
sentences. We also assess and compare the performance of state-of-the-art NER
models for the dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在分子结构解析任务中表现不佳，主要原因是缺乏专业化学知识。

Method: 构建外部分子子结构知识库扩展LLMs的化学结构覆盖范围，并设计专门的分子-光谱评分器作为推理过程的奖励模型。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法显著提升了性能，特别是在GPT-4o-mini和GPT-4o上获得了超过20%的改进。

Conclusion: K-MSE框架通过知识增强和优化推理过程，有效解决了LLMs在分子结构解析中的局限性。

Abstract: Molecular structure elucidation involves deducing a molecule's structure from
various types of spectral data, which is crucial in chemical experimental
analysis. While large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency
in analyzing and reasoning through complex tasks, they still encounter
substantial challenges in molecular structure elucidation. We identify that
these challenges largely stem from LLMs' limited grasp of specialized chemical
knowledge. In this work, we introduce a Knowledge-enhanced reasoning framework
for Molecular Structure Elucidation (K-MSE), leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search
for test-time scaling as a plugin. Specifically, we construct an external
molecular substructure knowledge base to extend the LLMs' coverage of the
chemical structure space. Furthermore, we design a specialized
molecule-spectrum scorer to act as a reward model for the reasoning process,
addressing the issue of inaccurate solution evaluation in LLMs. Experimental
results show that our approach significantly boosts performance, particularly
gaining more than 20% improvement on both GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o. Our code is

TL;DR: Text2VectorSQL结合Text-to-SQL和向量搜索，解决非结构化数据和模糊查询的问题，支持语义过滤和多模态匹配，性能优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Text-to-SQL对非结构化数据和模糊查询效果不佳，而向量搜索缺乏自动化评估框架，需结合两者优势。

Method: 提出Text2VectorSQL框架，支持语义过滤和多模态匹配，通过向量索引和语义搜索扩展查询，并开发专用模型。

Result: 性能显著优于基线方法，为Text2VectorSQL任务奠定基础。

Conclusion: Text2VectorSQL为更灵活直观的数据库接口铺平道路，代码将开源。

Abstract: While Text-to-SQL enables natural language interaction with structured
databases, its effectiveness diminishes with unstructured data or ambiguous
queries due to rigid syntax and limited expressiveness. Concurrently, vector
search has emerged as a powerful paradigm for semantic retrieval, particularly
for unstructured data. However, existing VectorSQL implementations still rely
heavily on manual crafting and lack tailored evaluation frameworks, leaving a
significant gap between theoretical potential and practical deployment. To
bridge these complementary paradigms, we introduces Text2VectorSQL, a novel
framework unifying Text-to-SQL and vector search to overcome expressiveness
constraints and support more diverse and holistical natural language queries.
Specifically, Text2VectorSQL enables semantic filtering, multi-modal matching,
and retrieval acceleration. For evaluation, we build vector index on
appropriate columns, extend user queries with semantic search, and annotate
ground truths via an automatic pipeline with expert review. Furthermore, we
develop dedicated Text2VectorSQL models with synthetic data, demonstrating
significant performance improvements over baseline methods. Our work
establishes the foundation for the Text2VectorSQL task, paving the way for more
versatile and intuitive database interfaces. The repository will be publicly
available at https://github.com/Open-DataFlow/Text2VectorSQL.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新基准Genres，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在双人互动中的性别偏见，揭示了单角色评估中未发现的偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要评估孤立场景中的性别偏见，忽视了人际互动中可能出现的微妙偏见，因此需要更深入的关系和上下文偏见评估。

Method: 通过双角色配置和叙事生成任务，设计Genres基准，捕捉人际动态并支持多维度细粒度偏见评估。

Result: 实验发现，MLLMs在双人互动中存在持续性、上下文敏感的性别偏见，这些偏见在单角色场景中不明显。

Conclusion: 关系感知的基准对诊断MLLMs中微妙的互动驱动性别偏见至关重要，并为未来偏见缓解提供了可操作的见解。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
across tasks involving both visual and textual modalities. However, growing
concerns remain about their potential to encode and amplify gender bias,
particularly in socially sensitive applications. Existing benchmarks
predominantly evaluate bias in isolated scenarios, overlooking how bias may
emerge subtly through interpersonal interactions. We fill this gap by going
beyond single-entity evaluation and instead focusing on a deeper examination of
relational and contextual gender bias in dual-individual interactions. We
introduce Genres, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate gender bias in MLLMs
through the lens of social relationships in generated narratives. Genres
assesses gender bias through a dual-character profile and narrative generation
task that captures rich interpersonal dynamics and supports a fine-grained bias
evaluation suite across multiple dimensions. Experiments on both open- and
closed-source MLLMs reveal persistent, context-sensitive gender biases that are
not evident in single-character settings. Our findings underscore the
importance of relationship-aware benchmarks for diagnosing subtle,
interaction-driven gender bias in MLLMs and provide actionable insights for
future bias mitigation.

TL;DR: INDIC-BIAS是一个印度中心的基准测试，用于评估LLMs在85个身份群体中的公平性，揭示了LLMs对边缘化群体的强烈偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平性研究主要针对西方，无法满足印度等文化多样性国家的需求。

Method: 通过专家咨询和手动验证，生成了20,000个现实场景模板，分为三个评估任务：合理性、判断和生成。

Result: 评估14个流行LLMs显示，模型对边缘化身份存在强烈负面偏见，且难以通过理性化减轻偏见。

Conclusion: LLMs可能对印度身份造成分配和代表性伤害，需谨慎使用。INDIC-BIAS作为开源基准发布，推动印度背景下的偏见研究。

Abstract: Existing studies on fairness are largely Western-focused, making them
inadequate for culturally diverse countries such as India. To address this gap,
we introduce INDIC-BIAS, a comprehensive India-centric benchmark designed to
evaluate fairness of LLMs across 85 identity groups encompassing diverse
castes, religions, regions, and tribes. We first consult domain experts to
curate over 1,800 socio-cultural topics spanning behaviors and situations,
where biases and stereotypes are likely to emerge. Grounded in these topics, we
generate and manually validate 20,000 real-world scenario templates to probe
LLMs for fairness. We structure these templates into three evaluation tasks:
plausibility, judgment, and generation. Our evaluation of 14 popular LLMs on
these tasks reveals strong negative biases against marginalized identities,
with models frequently reinforcing common stereotypes. Additionally, we find
that models struggle to mitigate bias even when explicitly asked to rationalize
their decision. Our evaluation provides evidence of both allocative and
representational harms that current LLMs could cause towards Indian identities,
calling for a more cautious usage in practical applications. We release
INDIC-BIAS as an open-source benchmark to advance research on benchmarking and
mitigating biases and stereotypes in the Indian context.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在英语和混合语言（英语-印地语）的网络迷因中识别叙事角色（英雄、反派、受害者等）的挑战，通过多种模型评估，发现文化背景和提示设计对任务表现至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络迷因中的叙事角色识别具有文化和语言复杂性，现有数据集偏向‘其他’类别，需更平衡和多样化的数据支持。

Method: 扩展了标注数据集，评估了多种模型（如多语言Transformer、多模态模型等），并探索了提示设计策略。

Result: 大模型（如DeBERTa-v3）表现较好，但‘受害者’类识别仍具挑战性，混合提示设计略有提升。

Conclusion: 文化背景、提示工程和多模态推理对识别视觉-文本内容中的叙事框架至关重要。

Abstract: This work investigates the challenging task of identifying narrative roles -
Hero, Villain, Victim, and Other - in Internet memes, across three diverse test
sets spanning English and code-mixed (English-Hindi) languages. Building on an
annotated dataset originally skewed toward the 'Other' class, we explore a more
balanced and linguistically diverse extension, originally introduced as part of
the CLEF 2024 shared task. Comprehensive lexical and structural analyses
highlight the nuanced, culture-specific, and context-rich language used in real
memes, in contrast to synthetically curated hateful content, which exhibits
explicit and repetitive lexical markers. To benchmark the role detection task,
we evaluate a wide spectrum of models, including fine-tuned multilingual
transformers, sentiment and abuse-aware classifiers, instruction-tuned LLMs,
and multimodal vision-language models. Performance is assessed under zero-shot
settings using precision, recall, and F1 metrics. While larger models like
DeBERTa-v3 and Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate notable gains, results reveal consistent
challenges in reliably identifying the 'Victim' class and generalising across
cultural and code-mixed content. We also explore prompt design strategies to
guide multimodal models and find that hybrid prompts incorporating structured
instructions and role definitions offer marginal yet consistent improvements.
Our findings underscore the importance of cultural grounding, prompt
engineering, and multimodal reasoning in modelling subtle narrative framings in
visual-textual content.

Result: 在ALFWorld和ScienceWorld基准测试中分别达到97.78%和79.92%的完成率，泛化能力强。

Conclusion: Embodied Planner-R1显著提升了模型在具身任务规划中的表现，展示了强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various tasks, yet they face significant challenges in embodied task planning
scenarios that require continuous environmental understanding and action
generation. Existing approaches generate open-loop action scripts based on
static knowledge, making it difficult to learn causal relationships between
actions and environmental feedback, particularly in partially observable
environments. We introduce Embodied Planner-R1, a novel outcome-driven
reinforcement learning framework that enables LLMs to develop interactive
capabilities through autonomous exploration with minimal supervision. Our
framework incorporates three key innovations: (1) Without human annotations, we
employ pure reinforcement learning with group rollout, incorporating
in-environment interaction through parallel exploration; (2) completion-driven
sparse reward; and (3) Interactive Policy Optimization (IPO) for efficient
learning from grouped trajectories. Across two challenging text-based Embodied
planning benchmarks, Embodied Planner-R1 achieves impressive completion rates
of 97.78% on ALFWorld and 79.92% on ScienceWorld, surpassing prior methods by a
large margin, and suffers only a -3.66% drop in previously unseen environments,
evidencing strong generalization.

Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖人工标注格式的问题，降低标注成本并提高适应性。

Result: 在数学和常识推理任务中，平均性能提升4.3%。

Conclusion: Format-Adapter通过自动生成和选择格式，有效提升了LLMs的推理性能。

Abstract: Generating and voting multiple answers is an effective method to mitigate
reasoning inconsistencies of large language models (LLMs). Prior works have
shown that multiple reasoning formats outperform a single format when
generating multiple answers. However, previous works using multiple formats
rely on formats labeled by humans, which could be unsuitable for all tasks and
have high labeling costs. To address this issue, we adapt suitable formats to
the given tasks by generating and selecting formats. We first propose how to
measure the reasoning error when generating multiple answers. Then, we
introduce Format-Adapter, which utilizes LLMs to generate and select suitable
reasoning formats by minimizing the error measurement we present. We conduct
experiments on math and commonsense reasoning tasks, where Format-Adapter
achieves a 4.3% performance improvement on average over previous works,
demonstrating the effectiveness.

Motivation: 解决传统RAG管道在处理复杂技术文档（含表格和图像）时的局限性，提升LLMs在技术文档问答中的性能。

Method: 结合向量相似性搜索和基于Gemma-2-9b-it的重新排序器，使用RAFT方法在自定义数据集上训练，优化上下文识别。

Result: 在RAGas和DeepEval评估中，忠实度分别达到94%和96%，答案相关性分别为87%和93%，优于通用RAG管道。

Conclusion: 提出的RAG管道显著提升了技术文档问答的性能，尤其在处理表格和上下文外问题时表现优异。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of natural language understanding
and generation. But they face challenges such as hallucination and outdated
knowledge. Fine-tuning is one possible solution, but it is resource-intensive
and must be repeated with every data update. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) offers an efficient solution by allowing LLMs to access external
knowledge sources. However, traditional RAG pipelines struggle with retrieving
information from complex technical documents with structured data such as
tables and images. In this work, we propose a RAG pipeline, capable of handling
tables and images in documents, for technical documents that support both
scanned and searchable formats. Its retrieval process combines vector
similarity search with a fine-tuned reranker based on Gemma-2-9b-it. The
reranker is trained using RAFT (Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning) on a custom
dataset designed to improve context identification for question answering. Our
evaluation demonstrates that the proposed pipeline achieves a high faithfulness
score of 94% (RAGas) and 96% (DeepEval), and an answer relevancy score of 87%
(RAGas) and 93% (DeepEval). Comparative analysis demonstrates that the proposed
architecture is superior to general RAG pipelines in terms of table-based
questions and handling questions outside context.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Flow-Modulated Scoring (FMS)的框架，用于知识图谱补全，通过结合上下文感知的静态表示和动态信息，显著提升了关系语义建模的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱补全方法主要基于静态嵌入评分，难以捕捉上下文依赖和关系动态性。FMS旨在填补这一空白。

Method: FMS包含两个模块：语义上下文学习模块（编码上下文敏感的实体表示）和条件流匹配模块（学习从头部到尾部嵌入的动态转换）。

Result: 在多个标准基准测试中，FMS超越了现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: FMS通过结合静态和动态信息，实现了更深入的关系语义建模，显著提升了知识图谱补全的性能。

Abstract: Effective modeling of multifaceted relations is pivotal for Knowledge Graph
Completion (KGC). However, a majority of existing approaches are predicated on
static, embedding-based scoring, exhibiting inherent limitations in capturing
contextual dependencies and relational dynamics. Addressing this gap, we
propose the Flow-Modulated Scoring (FMS) framework. FMS comprises two principal
components: (1) a semantic context learning module that encodes
context-sensitive entity representations, and (2) a conditional flow-matching
module designed to learn the dynamic transformation from a head to a tail
embedding, governed by the aforementioned context. The resultant predictive
vector field, representing the context-informed relational path, serves to
dynamically refine the initial static score of an entity pair. Through this
synergy of context-aware static representations and conditioned dynamic
information, FMS facilitates a more profound modeling of relational semantics.
Comprehensive evaluations on several standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
proposed method surpasses prior state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: We present a new benchmark for evaluating Deep Search--a realistic and
complex form of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that requires
source-aware, multi-hop reasoning over diverse, sparsed, but related sources.
These include documents, meeting transcripts, Slack messages, GitHub, and URLs,
which vary in structure and often contain human-to-human interactions. We build
it using a synthetic data pipeline that simulates business workflows across
product planning, development, and support stages, generating interconnected
content with realistic noise and multi-hop questions with guaranteed
ground-truth answers. We release our benchmark with both answerable and
unanswerable queries, and retrieval pool of 39,190 enterprise artifacts,
enabling fine-grained evaluation of long-context LLM and RAG systems. Our
experiments reveal that even the best-performing agentic RAG methods achieve an
average performance score of 32.96 on our benchmark. With further analysis, we
highlight retrieval as the main bottleneck: existing methods struggle to
conduct deep searches and retrieve all necessary evidence. Consequently, they
often reason over partial context, leading to significant performance
degradation.

Motivation: 当前评估ICL效果的方法存在可靠性低、归因性差和数据不足时不可行的问题，需要一种更可靠的指标。

Method: 通过建模学习增益与上下文相关性之间的斜率（LCS）来量化ICL有效性，减少对标注数据的依赖。

Result: LCS与性能改进强相关，在数据稀缺或偏置场景中也能可靠反映ICL效果，并揭示了关键模型能力。

Conclusion: LCS是一种可靠且实用的ICL有效性评估指标，为实践者提供了可操作的阈值和模型能力分析。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as an effective approach to enhance the
performance of large language models (LLMs). However, its effectiveness varies
significantly across models and tasks, posing challenges for practitioners to
determine when ICL reliably improves performance. Current evaluation
approaches, reliant on performance change after applying ICL, suffer from low
reliability, poor attribution, and impracticality in data-insufficient
scenarios. We propose the Learning-to-Context Slope (LCS), a novel metric that
quantifies ICL effectiveness by modeling the slope between learning gain (loss
decrease from demonstrations) and contextual relevance (demonstration-input
relevance). LCS addresses key limitations of performance-based metrics: (1) it
captures continuous loss changes even when outputs are incorrect, improving
reliability; (2) its formulation attributes ICL failures to weak contextual
alignment (inability to adapt inputs to demonstrations) or strong output
calibration (self-verification of correctness); and (3) it minimizes reliance
on labeled data via synthetic evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that LCS strongly correlates with performance improvements in labeled settings
and reliably reflects true effectiveness in biased or data-scarce scenarios.
Further analysis reveals actionable thresholds for LCS and identifies model
capabilities critical to ICL success.

Result: 实验显示V-Synthesis平均性能提升2.0%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: V-Synthesis有效解决了从零合成演示的一致性问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: High labeling cost for in-context learning (ICL) demonstrations motivates
using large language models (LLMs) for synthesis to reduce overhead. However,
existing synthesis methods are mainly task-specific or rely on pre-existing
demonstrations. So this paper focuses on synthesizing demonstrations from
scratch for arbitrary tasks. A major challenge in synthesizing from scratch is
ensuring consistency with the target task, as the lack of labeling guidance
could lead to synthesis bias. We first propose a consistency metric called
V-Score, which has higher performance and lower computation cost compared with
the metrics based on grams or embedding vectors. Furthermore, we introduce
V-Synthesis, which leverages V-Score for proportional sampling to ensure both
high consistency and diversity of synthesized demonstrations. Experimental
results demonstrate that V-Synthesis yields an average performance improvement
of 2.0% compared to existing synthesis methods confirming the effectiveness of
V-Synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统词嵌入模型是静态的，无法适应语言模式的动态变化（如社交媒体中的新词汇），因此需要增量词嵌入技术。

Method: RiverText实现了多种增量词嵌入技术（如Skip-gram、CBOW和Word Context Matrix），并提供了标准化框架和PyTorch后端支持。

Result: 库中实现了动态评估任务，比较了不同方法和超参数设置的结果。

Conclusion: RiverText为信息检索和自然语言处理社区提供了一个开源工具，适用于流式场景中的词嵌入需求。

Abstract: Word embeddings have become essential components in various information
retrieval and natural language processing tasks, such as ranking, document
classification, and question answering. However, despite their widespread use,
traditional word embedding models present a limitation in their static nature,
which hampers their ability to adapt to the constantly evolving language
patterns that emerge in sources such as social media and the web (e.g., new
hashtags or brand names). To overcome this problem, incremental word embedding
algorithms are introduced, capable of dynamically updating word representations
in response to new language patterns and processing continuous data streams.
  This paper presents RiverText, a Python library for training and evaluating
incremental word embeddings from text data streams. Our tool is a resource for
the information retrieval and natural language processing communities that work
with word embeddings in streaming scenarios, such as analyzing social media.
The library implements different incremental word embedding techniques, such as
Skip-gram, Continuous Bag of Words, and Word Context Matrix, in a standardized
framework. In addition, it uses PyTorch as its backend for neural network
training. We have implemented a module that adapts existing intrinsic static
word embedding evaluation tasks for word similarity and word categorization to
a streaming setting. Finally, we compare the implemented methods with different
hyperparameter settings and discuss the results. Our open-source library is

reward models trained on costly human preference data. While recent work
explores bypassing this cost with AI feedback, these methods often lack a
rigorous theoretical foundation. In this paper, we discover that a powerful
generalist reward model is already latently present within any LLM trained via
standard next-token prediction. We prove that this endogenous reward is not a
heuristic, but is theoretically equivalent to a reward function learned through
offline inverse reinforcement learning. This connection allows us to directly
elicit a high-quality reward signal from a base (pre-trained or supervised
fine-tuned) model without any further training. Critically, we also prove that
subsequent reinforcement learning using this endogenous reward leads to a
policy with a provably superior error bound compared to the base model. To our
best knowledge, this is the first theoretical proof of the effectiveness of
reinforcement learning for LLMs. Our experiments validate this theory,
demonstrating that our method not only outperforms existing LLM-as-a-judge
approaches but can also surpass explicitly trained reward models. These
findings suggest that the reward modeling stage can be replaced by a principled
method of eliciting the knowledge already captured during pre-training,
heralding a more efficient, powerful, and scalable paradigm for LLMs alignment
as well as multi-modal models.

### [45] [Two Spelling Normalization Approaches Based on Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23288)
*Miguel Domingo,Francisco Casacuberta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出两种基于大语言模型的拼写规范化方法，一种无监督训练，另一种基于机器翻译。实验表明，统计机器翻译仍是该任务的最佳选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决历史文献中拼写不标准化的问题，以符合现代拼写规范。

Method: 提出两种方法：无监督训练的大语言模型和基于机器翻译的模型。

Result: 在多语言和历史时期的数据集上评估，两种方法均有不错表现，但统计机器翻译效果更优。

Conclusion: 统计机器翻译仍是拼写规范化任务的最适合技术。

Abstract: The absence of standardized spelling conventions and the organic evolution of
human language present an inherent linguistic challenge within historical
documents, a longstanding concern for scholars in the humanities. Addressing
this issue, spelling normalization endeavors to align a document's orthography
with contemporary standards. In this study, we propose two new approaches based
on large language models: one of which has been trained without a supervised
training, and a second one which has been trained for machine translation. Our
evaluation spans multiple datasets encompassing diverse languages and
historical periods, leading us to the conclusion that while both of them
yielded encouraging results, statistical machine translation still seems to be
the most suitable technology for this task.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于局部事件驱动涌现学习的神经符号生成语言模型框架，核心是分层Hopfield记忆链，用于动态分词和短时记忆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何从局部神经学习中涌现出符号结构，构建可扩展、可解释的神经符号系统。

Method: 使用分层Hopfield记忆链作为动态分词器，通过投影张量绑定共现特征，形成多尺度表示。

Result: 模型能从噪声中过滤自然语言模式，生成具有内部形态一致性的合成语言，且支持长时记忆和组合推理。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究符号结构如何从局部神经学习中涌现提供了方法论基础，推动了生成语言模型的神经形态架构发展。

Abstract: We present a neuro-symbolic framework for generative language modeling based
on local, event-driven emergent learning. At its core is a hierarchical
Hopfield memory chain acting as a compositional short-term memory and dynamic
tokenizer (retokenizer). Rather than relying on predefined tokens or
supervision, the model builds structure from scratch, learning symbol sequences
as multi-scale representations. It constructs projection tensors that bind
co-occurring features into hierarchical tokens, introducing redundancy (i.e an
emergent gauge structure) and enabling compression of local activations into
long-range dependencies. Curiously, we find that the retokenizer can filter
natural language patterns from noise, generating synthetic languages with
coherent internal morphology -- quantifiably the same as human language.
Language is learned in a local (Hebbian) fashion, where model constraints
dictate allowed emergent structure, and new information is retained in
alignment with this structure. The absence of a global objective enables a form
of plasticity not found in conventional language models, allowing the system to
generalize beyond its initial inference class -- even without explicit data. We
demonstrate that briefly activating a new neuron during inference binds
distributed multi-scale token features into a symbolic embedding. These
emergent embedding neurons act as long-term memory and support a key-value
mechanism for compositional inference and generalization. This architecture
provides a methodological foundation for studying how symbolic structure can
emerge from local neural learning. It offers a new pathway for building
scalable, interpretable neuro-symbolic systems -- where tokens, grammar, and
reasoning arise as compressed memory traces within a Hopfield hierarchy. This
approach advances the development of neuromorphic architectures for generative
language models.

TL;DR: 研究通过构建基于BERT的集成模型，从临床笔记中检测和分类药物事件，显著提升了性能指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别健康记录和临床笔记中的关键变量（如药物、疾病、关系）在临床领域有广泛应用。n2c2 2022提供了相关共享任务，本研究专注于其中的药物事件检测与分类。

Method: 使用Wikipedia和MIMIC等大数据预训练BERT模型，然后在CMED训练数据上微调，最后通过投票策略集成多个BERT模型的预测结果。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于BERT的集成模型能将严格Micro-F分数提升约5%，严格Macro-F分数提升约6%。

Conclusion: BERT集成模型能有效提升药物事件分类的性能。

Abstract: Identification of key variables such as medications, diseases, relations from
health records and clinical notes has a wide range of applications in the
clinical domain. n2c2 2022 provided shared tasks on challenges in natural
language processing for clinical data analytics on electronic health records
(EHR), where it built a comprehensive annotated clinical data Contextualized
Medication Event Dataset (CMED). This study focuses on subtask 2 in Track 1 of
this challenge that is to detect and classify medication events from clinical
notes through building a novel BERT-based ensemble model. It started with
pretraining BERT models on different types of big data such as Wikipedia and
MIMIC. Afterwards, these pretrained BERT models were fine-tuned on CMED
training data. These fine-tuned BERT models were employed to accomplish
medication event classification on CMED testing data with multiple predictions.
These multiple predictions generated by these fine-tuned BERT models were
integrated to build final prediction with voting strategies. Experimental
results demonstrated that BERT-based ensemble models can effectively improve
strict Micro-F score by about 5% and strict Macro-F score by about 6%,
respectively.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了训练数据、语言距离和语言家族对多语言翻译信息损失的影响，发现数据量和语言结构关系共同影响翻译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多语言翻译中表现优异，但在某些语言对（尤其是训练数据有限或与英语差异较大的语言）上仍面临挑战。

Method: 通过往返翻译评估GPT-4和Llama 2，使用BLEU分数和BERT相似度指标衡量翻译质量。

Result: 训练数据量和语言距离的交互作用显著：数据充足可缓解语言差异影响，而结构接近英语的语言在低资源条件下表现更好。

Conclusion: 翻译质量不仅受数据量影响，还受语言结构和类型关系制约，为多语言翻译的优化提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved impressive progress in multilingual
translation, yet they continue to face challenges with certain language
pairs-particularly those with limited training data or significant linguistic
divergence from English. This study systematically investigates how training
data, language proximity, and language family affect information loss in
multilingual translation. We evaluate two large language models, GPT-4 and
Llama 2, by performing round-trip translations. Translation quality was
assessed using BLEU scores and BERT similarity metrics. Our results reveal a
robust interaction between training data size and language distance: while
abundant training data can mitigate the effects of linguistic divergence,
languages structurally closer to English consistently yield higher translation
quality in low-resource conditions. Among various distance metrics,
orthographic, phylogenetic, syntactic, and geographical distances emerge as
strong predictors of translation performance. Language family also exerts an
independent influence. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of
the linguistic constraints shaping multilingual translation in large language
models, emphasizing that translation quality is shaped not only by data volume
but also by structural and typological relationships between languages.

TL;DR: ATGen框架将主动学习（AL）与文本生成任务结合，减少人工标注和LLM API调用成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AL在减少标注工作量方面潜力巨大，但其在自然语言生成（NLG）任务中的应用有限。

Method: 提出ATGen框架，支持AL策略在NLG任务中的应用，结合人工标注和基于LLM的自动标注。

Result: ATGen显著减少了人工标注和LLM API调用的成本。

Conclusion: ATGen为NLG任务提供了一个高效的AL应用和评测平台。

Abstract: Active learning (AL) has demonstrated remarkable potential in reducing the
annotation effort required for training machine learning models. However,
despite the surging popularity of natural language generation (NLG) tasks in
recent years, the application of AL to NLG has been limited. In this paper, we
introduce Active Text Generation (ATGen) - a comprehensive framework that
bridges AL with text generation tasks, enabling the application of
state-of-the-art AL strategies to NLG. Our framework simplifies AL-empowered
annotation in NLG tasks using both human annotators and automatic annotation
agents based on large language models (LLMs). The framework supports LLMs
deployed as services, such as ChatGPT and Claude, or operated on-premises.
Furthermore, ATGen provides a unified platform for smooth implementation and
benchmarking of novel AL strategies tailored to NLG tasks. Finally, we present
evaluation results for state-of-the-art AL strategies across diverse settings
and multiple text generation tasks. We show that ATGen reduces both the effort
of human annotators and costs associated with API calls to LLM-based annotation
agents. The code of the framework is available on GitHub under the MIT license.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏对LLM输出偏见和视角的量化理解，本文旨在解决通用文本的视角问题及LLM输出视角控制。

Method: Perspective-Dial包括Perspective Space（量化视角的度量空间）和Systematic Prompt Engineering（基于反馈调整LLM输出视角）。

Result: 该方法通过实证量化并调整LLM输出视角，适用于多种主题。

Conclusion: Perspective-Dial在检测、跟踪和缓解LLM偏见、公共话语分析及辩论机器人等领域具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are used in a variety of mission-critical roles.
Due to the rapidly developing nature of LLMs, there is a lack of quantifiable
understanding of the bias and perspective associated with LLM output. Inspired
by this need, this paper considers the broader issue of perspective or
viewpoint of general text and perspective control of large-language model (LLM)
output. Perspective-Dial consists of two main components: a (1) metric space,
dubbed Perspective Space, that enables quantitative measurements of different
perspectives regarding a topic, and the use of (2) Systematic Prompt
Engineering that utilizes greedy-coordinate descent to control LLM output
perspective based on measurement feedback from the Perspective Space. The
empirical nature of the approach allows progress to side step a principled
understanding of perspective or bias -- effectively quantifying and adjusting
outputs for a variety of topics. Potential applications include detection,
tracking and mitigation of LLM bias, narrative detection, sense making and
tracking in public discourse, and debate bot advocating given perspective.

Motivation: 自动生成维基百科文章需要整合多源信息，确保准确性和结构化，现有方法难以满足这些需求。

Method: MOG框架从网页文档中提取细粒度记忆单元，递归组织为维基百科式分层结构，并利用该结构指导生成过程，同时引入引用模块增强可追溯性。

Result: 在WikiStart数据集上的实验表明，MOG在生成信息丰富且可靠的文章方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: MOG框架通过分层记忆和引用模块，显著提升了生成文章的质量和可验证性，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: Generating Wikipedia articles autonomously is a challenging task requiring
the integration of accurate, comprehensive, and well-structured information
from diverse sources. This paper introduces the Memory Organization-based
Generation (MOG) framework, a novel approach to address these challenges by
leveraging a hierarchical memory architecture. MOG extracts fine-grained memory
units from web documents, recursively organizes them into a Wikipedia-style
hierarchical structure, and uses this structure to guide the generation
process. This ensures alignment between memory and the article outline,
improving both informativeness and verifiability while minimizing
hallucinations. Additionally, a citation module is implemented to enhance
traceability by linking every generated sentence to specific memory units.
Evaluations on our newly created WikiStart dataset demonstrate that MOG
outperforms baseline methods in producing informative and reliable articles,
making it particularly robust in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: 呼吁创建更反映多样社会背景的公平性基准，并促进透明和可重复的研究。

Abstract: Fairness benchmarks play a central role in shaping how we evaluate language
models, yet surprisingly little attention has been given to examining the
datasets that these benchmarks rely on. This survey addresses that gap by
presenting a broad and careful review of the most widely used fairness datasets
in current language model research, characterizing them along several key
dimensions including their origin, scope, content, and intended use to help
researchers better appreciate the assumptions and limitations embedded in these
resources. To support more meaningful comparisons and analyses, we introduce a
unified evaluation framework that reveals consistent patterns of demographic
disparities across datasets and scoring methods. Applying this framework to
twenty four common benchmarks, we highlight the often overlooked biases that
can influence conclusions about model fairness and offer practical guidance for
selecting, combining, and interpreting these datasets. We also point to
opportunities for creating new fairness benchmarks that reflect more diverse
social contexts and encourage more thoughtful use of these tools going forward.

Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对微调如何影响LLM个体输出的定量分析，需系统性方法。

Method: 通过跟踪隐藏状态分解微调模型为预训练和微调成分，定义TuCo（微调贡献比），并实验调整其比例。

Result: 发现TuCo与对抗攻击成功负相关，微调成分的减弱可能助长攻击。

Conclusion: TuCo为研究微调对模型行为和安全的影响提供了量化工具。

Abstract: Past work has studied the effects of fine-tuning on large language models'
(LLMs) overall performance on certain tasks. However, a quantitative and
systematic method for analyzing its effect on individual outputs is still
lacking. Here, we propose a new method for measuring the contribution that
fine-tuning makes to individual LLM responses, assuming access to the original
pre-trained model. Our method tracks the model's intermediate hidden states,
providing a more fine-grained insight into the effects of fine-tuning than a
simple comparison of final outputs from pre-trained and fine-tuned models. We
introduce and theoretically analyze an exact decomposition of any fine-tuned
LLM into a pre-training component and a fine-tuning component. Empirically, we
find that model behavior and performance can be steered by up- or down-scaling
the fine-tuning component during the forward pass. Motivated by this finding
and our theoretical analysis, we define the Tuning Contribution (TuCo) as the
ratio of the magnitudes of the fine-tuning component to the pre-training
component. We observe that three prominent adversarial attacks on LLMs
circumvent safety measures in a way that reduces TuCo, and that TuCo is
consistently lower on prompts where these attacks succeed compared to those
where they do not. This suggests that attenuating the effect of fine-tuning on
model outputs plays a role in the success of such attacks. In summary, TuCo
enables the quantitative study of how fine-tuning influences model behavior and
safety, and vice versa.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型生成速度受限，需逐个生成标记，成为瓶颈。

Method: 采用流水线解码器，同时生成多个子序列，实现并行化。

Result: 在多项文本生成任务中，生成速度显著提升，质量无明显下降。

Conclusion: 流水线解码器有效解决了自回归模型的生成速度瓶颈。

Abstract: As the basis of generative AI, an autoregressive model requires the
generation of a new token depending on all the previously generated tokens,
which brings high quality but also restricts the model to generate tokens one
by one, forming a bottleneck limiting the generation speed. In this paper, we
propose a new decoder architecture that efficiently generates text in parallel
for context-aware generation tasks. Our proposed pipelined decoder initiates
the generation of multiple subsequences simultaneously, and, at each time-step,
it generates a new token for each subsequence to realize parallelism.
Experiments on multiple text generation tasks, including question answering,
text summarization, and keyphrase generation, show that our pipelined decoder
significantly improves the generation speed without a significant loss of
generation quality or additional memory consumption.

Conclusion: ATF能自适应平衡信息量和简洁性，适用于不同任务。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for table-based reasoning often struggle with
large tables due to input length limits. We propose ATF (Adaptive Table
Filtering Framework), a modular and question-aware filtering pipeline that
prunes uninformative columns and rows using LLM-generated column descriptions,
clustering, and sparse-dense alignment scores. ATF integrates seamlessly with
existing models (e.g., TAPAS, TAPEX) without retraining. Experiments show that
ATF reduces table cells by ~70\%, boosting performance on out-of-domain TableQA
tasks while causing slight performance drops on Table Fact Verification, where
full-table context is more critical. These results highlight ATF's ability to
adaptively balance informativeness and minimalism across tasks.

Method: 提出TAIRA系统，采用思想模式蒸馏（TPD）增强规划能力，并设计用户模拟方案进行评估。

Result: TAIRA在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，尤其在复杂任务中优势明显。

Conclusion: TAIRA能有效管理复杂用户意图，提升交互式推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Interactive recommendation is a typical information-seeking task that allows
users to interactively express their needs through natural language and obtain
personalized recommendations. Large language model-powered (LLM-powered) agents
have become a new paradigm in interactive recommendations, effectively
capturing users' real-time needs and enhancing personalized experiences.
However, due to limited planning and generalization capabilities, existing
formulations of LLM-powered interactive recommender agents struggle to
effectively address diverse and complex user intents, such as intuitive,
unrefined, or occasionally ambiguous requests. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a novel thought-augmented interactive recommender agent system (TAIRA)
that addresses complex user intents through distilled thought patterns.
Specifically, TAIRA is designed as an LLM-powered multi-agent system featuring
a manager agent that orchestrates recommendation tasks by decomposing user
needs and planning subtasks, with its planning capacity strengthened through
Thought Pattern Distillation (TPD), a thought-augmentation method that extracts
high-level thoughts from the agent's and human experts' experiences. Moreover,
we designed a set of user simulation schemes to generate personalized queries
of different difficulties and evaluate the recommendations based on specific
datasets. Through comprehensive experiments conducted across multiple datasets,
TAIRA exhibits significantly enhanced performance compared to existing methods.
Notably, TAIRA shows a greater advantage on more challenging tasks while
generalizing effectively on novel tasks, further validating its superiority in
managing complex user intents within interactive recommendation systems. The
code is publicly available at:https://github.com/Alcein/TAIRA.

Result: SFT快速适应任务但遗忘先验知识，RFT学习慢但保留知识。

Conclusion: 数据分布而非算法差异是遗忘主因，RFT在多模态大语言模型中具有稳定持续学习的潜力。

Abstract: Post-training algorithms such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) are widely used to adapt multimodal large
language models to downstream tasks. While effective at task adaptation, their
impact on prior knowledge remains unclear. In this paper, we introduce jigsaw
puzzles as a novel task absent from existing pretraining corpora and
systematically study the behavior of SFT and RFT on an open-source multimodal
model, Qwen2.5-VL. Our experiments reveal a sharp trade-off: SFT enables rapid
task acquisition but leads to catastrophic forgetting, whereas RFT learns more
slowly on novel tasks but maintains prior knowledge. We analyze this phenomenon
through the lens of learning dynamics, showing that RFT reinforces correct
samples that are naturally aligned with the base model's probability landscape,
mitigating interference with prior knowledge. Moreover, supervised training on
correct RFT-simulated rollouts allows SFT to preserve knowledge while rapidly
learning new tasks. These findings suggest that data distribution, rather than
algorithmic differences, plays a central role in forgetting, and highlight
RFT's potential for stable continual learning in multimodal large language
models.

Method: 通过人工标注20个食谱，分析记忆性和创造性；设计自动化流程（LLM-as-judge）扩展研究规模。

Conclusion: 自动化框架可量化LLM的记忆性、创造性和无意义内容，为模型创造力提供证据。

Abstract: This work-in-progress investigates the memorization, creativity, and nonsense
found in cooking recipes generated from Large Language Models (LLMs).
Precisely, we aim (i) to analyze memorization, creativity, and non-sense in
LLMs using a small, high-quality set of human judgments and (ii) to evaluate
potential approaches to automate such a human annotation in order to scale our
study to hundreds of recipes. To achieve (i), we conduct a detailed human
annotation on 20 preselected recipes generated by LLM (Mixtral), extracting
each recipe's ingredients and step-by-step actions to assess which elements are
memorized--i.e., directly traceable to online sources possibly seen during
training--and which arise from genuine creative synthesis or outright nonsense.
We find that Mixtral consistently reuses ingredients that can be found in
online documents, potentially seen during model training, suggesting strong
reliance on memorized content. To achieve aim (ii) and scale our analysis
beyond small sample sizes and single LLM validation, we design an
``LLM-as-judge'' pipeline that automates recipe generation, nonsense detection,
parsing ingredients and recipe steps, and their annotation. For instance,
comparing its output against human annotations, the best ingredient extractor
and annotator is Llama 3.1+Gemma 2 9B, achieving up to 78% accuracy on
ingredient matching. This automated framework enables large-scale
quantification of memorization, creativity, and nonsense in generated recipes,
providing rigorous evidence of the models' creative capacities.

Method: SemDiD结合正交方向引导、动态组间排斥和位置偏差概率评估三种机制，平衡质量与多样性。

Result: 实验显示SemDiD在多个任务中表现优于现有方法，提升Best-of-N覆盖率1.4-5.2%，加速RLHF训练15%，并提高准确性2.1%。

Conclusion: SemDiD有效解决了语义多样性问题，为相关应用提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Diverse decoding of large language models is crucial for applications
requiring multiple semantically distinct responses, yet existing methods
primarily achieve lexical rather than semantic diversity. This limitation
significantly constrains Best-of-N strategies, group-based reinforcement
learning, and data synthesis. While temperature sampling and diverse beam
search modify token distributions or apply n-gram penalties, they fail to
ensure meaningful semantic differentiation. We introduce Semantic-guided
Diverse Decoding (SemDiD), operating directly in embedding space that balances
quality with diversity through three complementary mechanisms: orthogonal
directional guidance, dynamic inter-group repulsion, and position-debiased
probability assessment. SemDiD harmonizes these competing objectives using
adaptive gain functions and constraint optimization, ensuring both quality
thresholds and maximal semantic differentiation. Experiments show SemDiD
consistently outperforms existing methods, improving Best-of-N coverage by
1.4-5.2% across diverse tasks and accelerating RLHF training convergence by 15%
while increasing accuracy by up to 2.1%.

### [61] [Evaluating the Simulation of Human Personality-Driven Susceptibility to Misinformation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23610)
*Manuel Pratelli,Marinella Petrocchi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs可以生成合成行为数据，但能否准确反映人格特质驱动的心理差异尚不明确。研究发现，某些人格特质（如随和性和尽责性）与错误信息的关联可被LLM复制，但其他特质存在偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM生成的行为数据是否能准确模拟人格特质驱动的心理差异，特别是在错误信息辨别方面。

Method: 利用已知人格特质的参与者数据集，创建匹配的LLM代理，比较其与人类行为模式的差异。

Result: LLM能复制某些人格特质与错误信息的关联（如随和性和尽责性），但其他特质存在系统性偏差。

Conclusion: LLM在模拟人格特质驱动的行为方面具有潜力，但也存在局限性，为人工智能代理的认知多样性建模提供了新见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make it possible to generate synthetic
behavioural data at scale, offering an ethical and low-cost alternative to
human experiments. Whether such data can faithfully capture psychological
differences driven by personality traits, however, remains an open question. We
evaluate the capacity of LLM agents, conditioned on Big-Five profiles, to
reproduce personality-based variation in susceptibility to misinformation,
focusing on news discernment, the ability to judge true headlines as true and
false headlines as false. Leveraging published datasets in which human
participants with known personality profiles rated headline accuracy, we create
matching LLM agents and compare their responses to the original human patterns.
Certain trait-misinformation associations, notably those involving
Agreeableness and Conscientiousness, are reliably replicated, whereas others
diverge, revealing systematic biases in how LLMs internalize and express
personality. The results underscore both the promise and the limits of
personality-aligned LLMs for behavioral simulation, and offer new insight into
modeling cognitive diversity in artificial agents.

Motivation: 评估文本分类系统的鲁棒性，通过最小修改改变模型预测。

Method: 扩展BeamAttack算法，支持单词删除和跳过替换，集成LIME优化替换优先级。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上攻击成功率达99%，保持语义和词汇相似性。

Conclusion: BeamAttack有效但存在局限性，代码已开源。

Abstract: We extend BeamAttack, an adversarial attack algorithm designed to evaluate
the robustness of text classification systems through word-level modifications
guided by beam search. Our extensions include support for word deletions and
the option to skip substitutions, enabling the discovery of minimal
modifications that alter model predictions. We also integrate LIME to better
prioritize word replacements. Evaluated across multiple datasets and victim
models (BiLSTM, BERT, and adversarially trained RoBERTa) within the BODEGA
framework, our approach achieves over a 99\% attack success rate while
preserving the semantic and lexical similarity of the original texts. Through
both quantitative and qualitative analysis, we highlight BeamAttack's
effectiveness and its limitations. Our implementation is available at

TL;DR: ZEST是一个零样本上下文适应框架，通过生成合成代理语料库替代真实语料访问，无需微调即可实现高性能嵌入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决上下文感知方法需要目标语料访问或领域特定微调的问题，适用于隐私敏感或资源受限的环境。

Method: 使用多步分层程序生成合成上下文语料库，模拟关键领域特定分布，冻结编码器使用代理语料库生成嵌入。

Result: 在MTEB基准测试中，仅用五个示例文档的ZEST性能接近全目标语料访问模型，差距在0.5%以内。

Conclusion: ZEST为受限环境下部署高性能、适应性强的嵌入提供了一种实用方法。

Abstract: Context-aware embedding methods boost retrieval accuracy by conditioning on
corpus statistics (e.g., term co-occurrence and topical patterns) extracted
from neighboring documents. However, this context-aware approach requires
access to the target corpus or requires domain-specific finetuning, posing
practical barriers in privacy-sensitive or resource-constrained settings. We
present ZEST, a zero-shot contextual adaptation framework that replaces real
corpus access with a one-time offline synthesis of a compact proxy. Given only
a handful exemplar documents representative of the general target domain, we
use a multi-step hierarchical procedure to generate a synthetic context corpus
of several hundred documents that aims to emulate key domain-specific
distributions. At inference, the frozen context-aware encoder uses this proxy
corpus -- without any finetuning or target corpus access -- to produce
domain-adapted embeddings. Across the MTEB benchmark, ZEST's zero-shot
synthetic context adaptation using only five example documents performs within
0.5% of models leveraging full target corpus access -- demonstrating remarkable
efficacy without any retraining. ZEST thus provides a practical method for
deploying high-performance, adaptable embeddings in constrained environments.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLMs）在多轮、长周期任务中作为自主代理时的可扩展性和训练效率问题。

Method: 引入 L0 框架和 NB-Agent 代理脚手架，采用“代码即动作”的 REPL 模式，并通过可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）训练模型。

Conclusion: L0 框架显著提升了模型的自主问题解决能力，并已开源全部系统。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) to act as autonomous agents for
multi-turn, long-horizon tasks remains significant challenges in scalability
and training efficiency. To address this, we introduce L-Zero (L0), a scalable,
end-to-end training pipeline for general-purpose agents. Featuring a low-cost,
extensible, and sandboxed concurrent agent worker pool, L0 lowers the barrier
for applying reinforcement learning in complex environments. We also introduce
NB-Agent, the agent scaffold within L0, which operates in a "code-as-action"
fashion via a Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL). We evaluate L0 on factuality
question-answering benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that a base model
can develop robust problem-solving skills using solely Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). On the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model, our method
boosts accuracy on SimpleQA from 30 % to 80 % and on HotpotQA from 22 % to 41
%. We have open-sourced the entire L0 system, including our L0 series models,
the NB-Agent, a complete training pipeline, and the corresponding training
recipes on (https://github.com/cmriat/l0).

TL;DR: AutoEvoEval是一个基于进化的评估框架，用于生成多样化和具有挑战性的测试样本，以更全面地评估大型语言模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估基准多为静态，无法充分评估模型在真实场景中的鲁棒性和泛化能力，需要更系统化的方法。

Method: 提出AutoEvoEval框架，包含22种可解释的原子进化操作，支持多轮组合生成测试样本。

Result: 实验显示原子操作导致平均准确率下降7.283%，多步组合使对抗效果放大至52.932%。

Conclusion: 当前基准可能高估模型泛化能力，需进化感知的鲁棒性评估。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on various
tasks, but existing evaluation benchmarks are often static and insufficient to
fully assess their robustness and generalization in realistic scenarios. Prior
work using evolutionary or adversarial data augmentation has improved
evaluation diversity but lacks systematic control over perturbation types and
multi-step complexity, limiting comprehensive robustness analysis. To address
these gaps, we propose AutoEvoEval, an evolution-based evaluation framework for
close-ended tasks such as multi-choice question answering. AutoEvoEval
introduces 22 interpretable atomic evolution operations and supports
multi-round compositions, enabling controlled generation of diverse,
challenging, and realistic test samples. We conduct extensive experiments
addressing four research questions on a broad set of open- and closed-source
LLMs. Our results show that atomic operations cause an average accuracy drop of
7.283\%, with structure-disrupting or misleading semantic edits causing the
largest declines. Model sensitivities vary significantly for the same
perturbation, and combining multiple evolution steps amplifies adversarial
effects by up to 52.932\%. These findings suggest current benchmarks may
overestimate true model generalization and emphasize the need for
evolution-aware robustness evaluation. Code and resources are available at:

TL;DR: 研究量化了大型语言模型在二元问题回答中的位置偏见，发现低不确定性条件下几乎无偏见，但高不确定性时偏见显著增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨模型在二元问题回答中因选项顺序而产生的系统性偏见，尤其是在不同不确定性条件下的表现。

Method: 通过改造SQuAD-it数据集，增加错误选项并减少上下文，创建从低到高不确定性的数据集，同时评估WebGPT和Winning Arguments两个高不确定性基准。

Result: 位置偏见在低不确定性时几乎不存在，但在高不确定性时呈指数增长。

Conclusion: 模型在不确定性高时更容易受选项顺序影响，需在设计评估方法时考虑位置偏见。

Abstract: Positional bias in binary question answering occurs when a model
systematically favors one choice over another based solely on the ordering of
presented options. In this study, we quantify and analyze positional bias
across five large language models under varying degrees of answer uncertainty.
We re-adapted the SQuAD-it dataset by adding an extra incorrect answer option
and then created multiple versions with progressively less context and more
out-of-context answers, yielding datasets that range from low to high
uncertainty. Additionally, we evaluate two naturally higher-uncertainty
benchmarks: (1) WebGPT - question pairs with unequal human-assigned quality
scores, and (2) Winning Arguments - where models predict the more persuasive
argument in Reddit's r/ChangeMyView exchanges. Across each dataset, the order
of the "correct" (or higher-quality/persuasive) option is systematically
flipped (first placed in position 1, then in position 2) to compute both
Preference Fairness and Position Consistency. We observe that positional bias
is nearly absent under low-uncertainty conditions, but grows exponentially when
it becomes doubtful to decide which option is correct.

TL;DR: DuP-PO算法通过优化策略减少大型推理模型在简单任务中的冗余思考标记，提升效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在处理简单任务时因冗余思考标记（如“wait”“however”）导致效率低下，甚至影响正确推理。

Method: 提出Dual Policy Preference Optimization (DuP-PO)，包括均衡采样策略、细粒度优势控制技术和策略塑造方法。

Result: 在五个数学推理基准测试中，DuP-PO显著提升模型效率和性能。

Conclusion: DuP-PO有效解决了大型推理模型的“思考陷阱”问题，提升了推理效率和准确性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at solving complex problems but face an
overthinking dilemma. When handling simple tasks, they often produce verbose
responses overloaded with thinking tokens (e.g., wait, however). These tokens
trigger unnecessary high-level reasoning behaviors like reflection and
backtracking, reducing efficiency. In this work, our pilot study reveals that
these thinking-token-induced behaviors are not essential for effective
problem-solving and may even hinder correct reasoning within constrained token
budgets. We identify this phenomenon as the thinking trap. To mitigate this
issue, we propose Dual Policy Preference Optimization (DuP-PO), a novel
algorithm featuring: (1) A rollout sampling strategy that guarantees balanced
exposure to responses with and without thinking tokens; (2) A fine-grained
advantage control technique to dynamically regulate the prediction of target
tokens; (3) A policy shaping method ensuring stable gradient contributions from
thinking tokens. Experimental results on five popular math reasoning benchmarks
show that DuP-PO performs well on the popular LRM, which significantly improves
their token efficiency during reasoning, while achieving superior performance
of the base model.

Motivation: 当前推理基准存在设计和方法上的缺陷，可能导致对LLM推理能力的误判，因此需要更严谨的评估方法。

Method: 使用五种LLM（GPT-3、3.5、4、o1和LLaMA 3.1）作为诊断工具，结合系统人工标注和重新评估清理后的基准子集，分析模型性能。

Result: 发现基准中存在重复项、模糊表述和不可信答案等问题，模型性能对输入微小变化敏感，高分可能反映格式对齐而非真实推理能力。

Conclusion: 当前基于基准的LLM推理能力评估存在局限性，需要开发更注重推理过程的评估协议，并发布了审计数据和工具以支持更透明的评估。

Abstract: We conduct a systematic audit of three widely used reasoning benchmarks,
SocialIQa, FauxPas-EAI, and ToMi, and uncover pervasive flaws in both benchmark
items and evaluation methodology. Using five LLMs (GPT-{3, 3.5, 4, o1}, and
LLaMA 3.1) as diagnostic tools, we identify structural, semantic, and pragmatic
issues in benchmark design (e.g., duplicated items, ambiguous wording, and
implausible answers), as well as scoring procedures that prioritize output form
over reasoning process. Through systematic human annotation and re-evaluation
on cleaned benchmark subsets, we find that model scores often improve not due
to due to erratic surface wording variations and not to improved reasoning.
Infact, further analyses show that model performance is highly sensitive to
minor input variations such as context availability and phrasing, revealing
that high scores may reflect alignment with format-specific cues rather than
consistent inference based on the input. These findings challenge the validity
of current benchmark-based claims about reasoning in LLMs, and highlight the
need for evaluation protocols that assess reasoning as a process of drawing
inference from available information, rather than as static output selection.
We release audited data and evaluation tools to support more interpretable and
diagnostic assessments of model reasoning.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在问题解决能力上有显著进步，但在复杂多步推理任务中仍表现不佳。

Method: MAPS采用迭代优化方法，结合CoT、自我反思和动态提示生成，逐步修正推理错误。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MAPS优于标准CoT，并与专用推理模型竞争，同时平衡了成本与性能。

Conclusion: MAPS为通用LLMs提供了接近专用推理模型的性能，并通过限制反思深度优化了成本效益。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
improved their problem-solving capabilities. However, these models still
struggle when faced with complex multi-step reasoning tasks. In this paper, we
propose the Multi-Layered Self-Reflection with Auto-Prompting (MAPS) framework,
a novel approach designed to enhance multi-step mathematical reasoning in LLMs
by integrating techniques such as Chain of Thought (CoT), Self-Reflection, and
Auto-Prompting. Unlike traditional static prompting methods, MAPS employs an
iterative refinement process. Initially, the model generates a solution using
CoT prompting. When errors are detected, an adaptive self-reflection mechanism
identifies and analyzes them, generating tailored prompts to guide corrections.
These dynamically adjusted prompts enable the model to iteratively refine its
reasoning. Experiments on four well-established benchmarks across multiple LLMs
show that MAPS significantly outperforms standard CoT and achieves competitive
results with reasoning-optimized models. In addition, MAPS enables
general-purpose LLMs to reach performance levels comparable to specialized
reasoning models. While deeper reflection layers improve accuracy, they also
increase token usage and costs. To balance this trade-off, MAPS strategically
limits reflection depth, ensuring an optimal balance between cost and reasoning
performance.

Motivation: 人们常将人类特性赋予LLM，并认为它们“知道”某些事情，但如何验证这些知识的真实性是一个关键问题。

Method: 提出了sAwMIL方法，基于多实例学习和一致性预测，利用LLM的内部激活状态区分真实、虚假和中性陈述。

Result: 在16个开源LLM上验证了sAwMIL的有效性，发现真伪信号集中在模型深度的第三部分，且线性探针在聊天模型上表现更好。

Conclusion: sAwMIL为验证LLM的内部知识提供了可靠方法，并揭示了真伪信号的不对称性及第三种中性信号的存在。

Abstract: We often attribute human characteristics to large language models (LLMs) and
claim that they "know" certain things. LLMs have an internal probabilistic
knowledge that represents information retained during training. How can we
assess the veracity of this knowledge? We examine two common methods for
probing the veracity of LLMs and discover several assumptions that are flawed.
To address these flawed assumptions, we introduce sAwMIL (short for Sparse
Aware Multiple-Instance Learning), a probing method that utilizes the internal
activations of LLMs to separate statements into true, false, and neither.
sAwMIL is based on multiple-instance learning and conformal prediction. We
evaluate sAwMIL on 5 validity criteria across 16 open-source LLMs, including
both default and chat-based variants, as well as on 3 new datasets. Among the
insights we provide are: (1) the veracity signal is often concentrated in the
third quarter of an LLM's depth; (2) truth and falsehood signals are not always
symmetric; (3) linear probes perform better on chat models than on default
models; (4) nonlinear probes may be required to capture veracity signals for
some LLMs with reinforcement learning from human feedback or knowledge
distillation; and (5) LLMs capture a third type of signal that is distinct from
true and false and is neither true nor false. These findings provide a reliable
method for verifying what LLMs "know" and how certain they are of their
probabilistic internal knowledge.

Result: LLMs在非英语语言和不常见形态模式上表现不佳，尤其是判断不合语法示例时。

Conclusion: LLMs在语言复杂性处理上存在不足，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant progress on various
multilingual benchmarks and are increasingly used to generate and evaluate text
in non-English languages. However, while they may produce fluent outputs, it
remains unclear to what extent these models truly grasp the underlying
linguistic complexity of those languages, particularly in morphology. To
investigate this, we introduce IMPACT, a synthetically generated evaluation
framework focused on inflectional morphology, which we publicly release,
designed to evaluate LLM performance across five morphologically rich
languages: Arabic, Russian, Finnish, Turkish, and Hebrew. IMPACT includes
unit-test-style cases covering both shared and language-specific phenomena,
from basic verb inflections (e.g., tense, number, gender) to unique features
like Arabic's reverse gender agreement and vowel harmony in Finnish and
Turkish. We assess eight multilingual LLMs that, despite strong English
performance, struggle with other languages and uncommon morphological patterns,
especially when judging ungrammatical examples. We also show that Chain of
Thought and Thinking Models can degrade performance. Our work exposes gaps in
LLMs' handling of linguistic complexity, pointing to clear room for
improvement. To support further research, we publicly release the IMPACT
framework.

Method: 研究了六种提示策略（如零样本提示、多样本提示、隐喻提示等），并在Llama2-7B模型上测试，同时比较了三种预训练词嵌入和三种深度学习模型。

Result: 隐喻提示在低资源语言（孟加拉语和印地语）中表现优异，且评估了环境影响因素（如CO2排放）。

Conclusion: 隐喻提示为低资源语言中的仇恨言论检测提供了有效且环保的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of social media leads to a marked increase in hate
speech, which threatens personal lives and results in numerous hate crimes.
Detecting hate speech presents several challenges: diverse dialects, frequent
code-mixing, and the prevalence of misspelled words in user-generated content
on social media platforms. Recent progress in hate speech detection is
typically concentrated on high-resource languages. However, low-resource
languages still face significant challenges due to the lack of large-scale,
high-quality datasets. This paper investigates how we can overcome this
limitation via prompt engineering on large language models (LLMs) focusing on
low-resource Bengali language. We investigate six prompting strategies -
zero-shot prompting, refusal suppression, flattering the classifier, multi-shot
prompting, role prompting, and finally our innovative metaphor prompting to
detect hate speech effectively in low-resource languages. We pioneer the
metaphor prompting to circumvent the built-in safety mechanisms of LLMs that
marks a significant departure from existing jailbreaking methods. We
investigate all six different prompting strategies on the Llama2-7B model and
compare the results extensively with three pre-trained word embeddings - GloVe,
Word2Vec, and FastText for three different deep learning models - multilayer
perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and bidirectional gated
recurrent unit (BiGRU). To prove the effectiveness of our metaphor prompting in
the low-resource Bengali language, we also evaluate it in another low-resource
language - Hindi, and two high-resource languages - English and German. The
performance of all prompting techniques is evaluated using the F1 score, and
environmental impact factor (IF), which measures CO$_2$ emissions, electricity
usage, and computational time.

Conclusion: 该框架为构建可组合、领域自适应的MLLMs提供了可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved success across various
domains. However, their applicability tends to degrade when confronted with
different types of data inputs, especially for MLLMs that have been fine-tuned
for specific tasks. Despite its importance, the study of knowledge sharing
among domain-specific MLLMs--such as those trained for mathematics or
code--remains largely underexplored. To address the fragmentation of knowledge
across domain-specialized MLLMs, we propose a unified parameter integration
framework that enables modular composition of expert capabilities. Our method
is grounded in a novel Compatibility-Aware Parameter Splicing (CAPS) strategy,
which leverages both local functional attribution and global
information-theoretic signals to guide selective parameter fusion. By extending
this mechanism to the low-rank adaptation layer granularity, we ensure
efficient integration with minimal inference overhead. Furthermore, we
introduce a domain compatibility scoring mechanism that quantifies inter-expert
alignment at the activation level and correlates with downstream task utility.
This principled fusion protocol allows the final model to synergize
heterogeneous expertise while preserving structural modularity. Extensive
evaluations across diverse multimodal benchmarks validate the effectiveness of
our framework, offering a scalable path toward compositional, domain-adaptive
MLLMs.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have been successfully used to probe Large

representations. These concepts are linear combinations of neuron activations
that correspond to human-interpretable features. In this paper, we investigate
the effectiveness of SAE-based explainability approaches for sentence
classification, a domain where such methods have not been extensively explored.
We present a novel SAE-based architecture tailored for text classification,
leveraging a specialized classifier head and incorporating an activation rate
sparsity loss. We benchmark this architecture against established methods such
as ConceptShap, Independent Component Analysis, and other SAE-based concept
extraction techniques. Our evaluation covers two classification benchmarks and
four fine-tuned LLMs from the Pythia family. We further enrich our analysis
with two novel metrics for measuring the precision of concept-based
explanations, using an external sentence encoder. Our empirical results show
that our architecture improves both the causality and interpretability of the
extracted features.

Abstract: Conducting supervised fine-tuning and preference fine-tuning on large
language models (LLMs) requires high-quality datasets to improve their ability
to follow instructions and align with human preferences and values. However,
constructing such datasets is resource-intensive, and most available datasets
for supervised and preference fine-tuning are in English. To address these
challenges, we propose the \underline{\textbf{Ta}}xonomy-Guided
\underline{\textbf{P}}reference Data Generation (TaP) framework, which
facilitates automated and scalable construction of preference datasets across
various languages. TaP is grounded in a structured taxonomy that allows
fine-grained control over dataset composition, thereby ensuring both diversity
and comprehensive coverage. We employ TaP-generated datasets to perform
supervised and preference fine-tuning on various LLMs. Experimental results
demonstrate that LLMs trained on TaP-generated datasets outperform those
trained on existing open-source datasets. Remarkably, LLMs trained on
TaP-generated datasets surpass the performance of those trained on an
open-source dataset that is 180 times larger.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学文本的忠实性对社会至关重要，但现有方法难以应对大规模的科学传播分析。

Method: 提出了自动事实核查、有限数据学习和科学文本处理的新方法，包括对抗性声明生成、多源域适应等。

Result: 开发了识别误导性科学声明的新工具，并揭示了科学传播过程中的信息变化。

Conclusion: 该研究为从有限科学文本中学习提供了有效方法，有助于理解科学传播并识别误导性信息。

Abstract: Scientific information expresses human understanding of nature. This
knowledge is largely disseminated in different forms of text, including
scientific papers, news articles, and discourse among people on social media.
While important for accelerating our pursuit of knowledge, not all scientific
text is faithful to the underlying science. As the volume of this text has
burgeoned online in recent years, it has become a problem of societal
importance to be able to identify the faithfulness of a given piece of
scientific text automatically. This thesis is concerned with the cultivation of
datasets, methods, and tools for machine understanding of scientific language,
in order to analyze and understand science communication at scale. To arrive at
this, I present several contributions in three areas of natural language
processing and machine learning: automatic fact checking, learning with limited
data, and scientific text processing. These contributions include new methods
and resources for identifying check-worthy claims, adversarial claim
generation, multi-source domain adaptation, learning from crowd-sourced labels,
cite-worthiness detection, zero-shot scientific fact checking, detecting
exaggerated scientific claims, and modeling degrees of information change in
science communication. Critically, I demonstrate how the research outputs of
this thesis are useful for effectively learning from limited amounts of
scientific text in order to identify misinformative scientific statements and
generate new insights into the science communication process

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的自动化主题分析（TA）流程，用于分析先天性心脏病（CHD）患者和护理者的临床叙事，无需人工编码或全文审查。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的手动主题分析（TA）方法耗时且难以扩展，而临床叙事中的丰富信息需要更高效的分析工具。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，由专门的LLM智能体分工协作，并通过强化学习从人类反馈（RLHF）优化主题相关性。

Result: 实现了对大规模定性数据集的自动化、以患者为中心的分析，并可针对特定临床场景微调LLM。

Conclusion: 该自动化TA流程为临床叙事分析提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，支持更深入的CHD患者体验研究。

Abstract: Congenital heart disease (CHD) presents complex, lifelong challenges often
underrepresented in traditional clinical metrics. While unstructured narratives
offer rich insights into patient and caregiver experiences, manual thematic
analysis (TA) remains labor-intensive and unscalable. We propose a fully
automated large language model (LLM) pipeline that performs end-to-end TA on
clinical narratives, which eliminates the need for manual coding or full
transcript review. Our system employs a novel multi-agent framework, where
specialized LLM agents assume roles to enhance theme quality and alignment with
human analysis. To further improve thematic relevance, we optionally integrate
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). This supports scalable,
patient-centered analysis of large qualitative datasets and allows LLMs to be
fine-tuned for specific clinical contexts.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在数学教育中的应用潜力，发现其能高效解决简单数学问题，但在理解真实世界情境方面仍有局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs如何支持数学学习，尤其是解决数学应用题的能力及其对课堂的潜在影响。

Method: 通过技术概述、文献综述和实证评估三部分，分析LLMs在数学应用题上的表现。

Result: LLMs在解决简单应用题（s-problems）上表现优异，但在处理真实情境问题时仍有不足。

Conclusion: LLMs虽能解决表面问题，但缺乏对应用题情境的深入理解，限制了其在数学教学中的价值。

Abstract: The progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT raises the question
of how they can be integrated into education. One hope is that they can support
mathematics learning, including word-problem solving. Since LLMs can handle
textual input with ease, they appear well-suited for solving mathematical word
problems. Yet their real competence, whether they can make sense of the
real-world context, and the implications for classrooms remain unclear. We
conducted a scoping review from a mathematics-education perspective, including
three parts: a technical overview, a systematic review of word problems used in
research, and a state-of-the-art empirical evaluation of LLMs on mathematical
word problems. First, in the technical overview, we contrast the
conceptualization of word problems and their solution processes between LLMs
and students. In computer-science research this is typically labeled
mathematical reasoning, a term that does not align with usage in mathematics
education. Second, our literature review of 213 studies shows that the most
popular word-problem corpora are dominated by s-problems, which do not require
a consideration of realities of their real-world context. Finally, our
evaluation of GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1, and o3 on 287 word problems
shows that most recent LLMs solve these s-problems with near-perfect accuracy,
including a perfect score on 20 problems from PISA. LLMs still showed
weaknesses in tackling problems where the real-world context is problematic or
non-sensical. In sum, we argue based on all three aspects that LLMs have
mastered a superficial solution process but do not make sense of word problems,
which potentially limits their value as instructional tools in mathematics
classrooms.

Conclusion: EXPERT通过标准化解释和高质量数据集，显著提升了图像描述评估的可靠性和解释性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models and vision-language models have led
to growing interest in explainable evaluation metrics for image captioning.
However, these metrics generate explanations without standardized criteria, and
the overall quality of the generated explanations remains unverified. In this
paper, we propose EXPERT, a reference-free evaluation metric that provides
structured explanations based on three fundamental criteria: fluency,
relevance, and descriptiveness. By constructing large-scale datasets of
high-quality structured explanations, we develop a two-stage evaluation
template to effectively supervise a vision-language model for both scoring and
explanation generation. EXPERT achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark
datasets while providing significantly higher-quality explanations than
existing metrics, as validated through comprehensive human evaluation. Our code
and datasets are available at https://github.com/hjkim811/EXPERT.

Motivation: 当前前沿AI开发者依赖多层防护措施防止AI系统被滥用，但这些管线的安全性尚未充分评估。

Method: 开发开源防御管线，测试少样本提示分类器的性能，并设计STACK攻击方法进行黑盒和转移攻击。

Result: 少样本提示分类器在ClearHarm数据集上将攻击成功率降至0%，但STACK攻击仍能达到71%的黑盒攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 防御管线需进一步改进以抵御STACK攻击，开发者可采用特定缓解措施。

Abstract: Frontier AI developers are relying on layers of safeguards to protect against
catastrophic misuse of AI systems. Anthropic guards their latest Claude 4 Opus
model using one such defense pipeline, and other frontier developers including
Google DeepMind and OpenAI pledge to soon deploy similar defenses. However, the
security of such pipelines is unclear, with limited prior work evaluating or
attacking these pipelines. We address this gap by developing and red-teaming an
open-source defense pipeline. First, we find that a novel few-shot-prompted
input and output classifier outperforms state-of-the-art open-weight safeguard
model ShieldGemma across three attacks and two datasets, reducing the attack
success rate (ASR) to 0% on the catastrophic misuse dataset ClearHarm. Second,
we introduce a STaged AttaCK (STACK) procedure that achieves 71% ASR on
ClearHarm in a black-box attack against the few-shot-prompted classifier
pipeline. Finally, we also evaluate STACK in a transfer setting, achieving 33%
ASR, providing initial evidence that it is feasible to design attacks with no
access to the target pipeline. We conclude by suggesting specific mitigations
that developers could use to thwart staged attacks.

TL;DR: 语言模型的文本预测能力与其嵌入空间的广度紧密相关，嵌入空间越分散，困惑度越低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型的嵌入空间分散度与其性能之间的关系，以提升模型效率和实用性。

Method: 通过测量隐藏向量的平均余弦距离（分散度），分析其与困惑度的相关性，并利用分散度进行模型选择、优化检索方法，以及通过训练目标提升分散度。

Result: 分散度与困惑度呈强负相关，且分散度可用于模型选择、优化检索方法，以及通过训练直接提升性能。

Conclusion: 嵌入空间的分散度是语言模型性能的重要指标，可用于多种无监督任务，并可通过训练优化。

Abstract: We show that a language model's ability to predict text is tightly linked to
the breadth of its embedding space: models that spread their contextual
representations more widely tend to achieve lower perplexity. Concretely, we
find that representation dispersion - the average pairwise cosine distance
among hidden vectors - strongly and negatively correlates with perplexity
across diverse model families (LLaMA, Qwen, and others) and domains (Wikipedia,
news, scientific abstracts). Beyond illustrating this link, we show how
dispersion can be leveraged for a range of practical tasks without requiring
labeled data. First, measuring dispersion on unlabeled text allows us to
predict downstream accuracy in new domains, offering a data-efficient tool for
model selection. Next, we find that identifying layers with higher dispersion
pinpoints the best representations for retrieval-based methods such as kNN-LM,
bypassing exhaustive layer-by-layer searches. Finally, we integrate a simple
push-away objective into training, which increases dispersion in both
single-domain and cross-domain scenarios and directly improves perplexity in
each.

Motivation: 传统手动比较方法耗时且易出错，研究旨在探索预训练模型在提高效率和准确性方面的潜力。

Method: 使用E5、AlephBERT、MPNet和LaBSE生成词嵌入，并通过余弦相似度和Wasserstein距离评估模型性能。

Result: E5在检测并行段落方面表现优异，AlephBERT在区分非并行段落上更强。

Conclusion: 预训练模型可提升古代文本并行段落检测的效率和准确性，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Identifying parallel passages in biblical Hebrew is foundational in biblical
scholarship for uncovering intertextual relationships. Traditional methods rely
on manual comparison, which is labor-intensive and prone to human error. This
study evaluates the potential of pre-trained transformer-based language models,
including E5, AlephBERT, MPNet, and LaBSE, for detecting textual parallels in
the Hebrew Bible. Focusing on known parallels between the books of Samuel/Kings
and Chronicles, I assessed each model's capability to generate word embeddings
that delineate parallel from non-parallel passages. Utilizing cosine similarity
and Wasserstein Distance measures, I found that E5 and AlephBERT show
significant promise, with E5 excelling in parallel detection and AlephBERT
demonstrating stronger non-parallel differentiation. These findings indicate
that pre-trained models can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of detecting
intertextual parallels in ancient texts, suggesting broader applications for
ancient language studies.

*Xinxin Sun,Peter Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理信息的图像对齐框架，针对结构健康监测中的裂纹定位问题，通过非线性各向异性扩散和RANSAC算法实现高精度对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征检测方法（如SIFT、SURF）在高频边缘（如薄裂纹）定位上表现不佳，而轻量级方法（如ORB、BRISK）在纹理或阴影表面重复性差。需要一种适应SHM特定挑战的解决方案。

Method: 利用非线性各向异性扩散构建裂纹保留的尺度空间，结合RANSAC估计单应性变换，无需训练或参数调优。

Result: 在多种实际条件下验证，裂纹面积和长度误差分别减少70%和90%，对齐误差低于5%。

Conclusion: 该方法为结构健康监测提供了一种无监督、可解释且计算轻量的图像对齐方案，适用于移动平台部署。

Abstract: Accurate image alignment is essential for monitoring crack evolution in
structural health monitoring (SHM), particularly under real-world conditions
involving perspective distortion, occlusion, and low contrast. However,
traditional feature detectors such as SIFT and SURF, which rely on
Gaussian-based scale spaces, tend to suppress high-frequency edges, making them
unsuitable for thin crack localization. Lightweight binary alternatives like
ORB and BRISK, while computationally efficient, often suffer from poor keypoint
repeatability on textured or shadowed surfaces. This study presents a
physics-informed alignment framework that adapts the open KAZE architecture to
SHM-specific challenges. By utilizing nonlinear anisotropic diffusion to
construct a crack-preserving scale space, and integrating RANSAC-based
homography estimation, the framework enables accurate geometric correction
without the need for training, parameter tuning, or prior calibration. The
method is validated on time-lapse images of masonry and concrete acquired via
handheld smartphone under varied field conditions, including shadow
interference, cropping, oblique viewing angles, and surface clutter. Compared
to classical detectors, the proposed framework reduces crack area and spine
length errors by up to 70 percent and 90 percent, respectively, while
maintaining sub-5 percent alignment error in key metrics. Unsupervised,
interpretable, and computationally lightweight, this approach supports scalable
deployment via UAVs and mobile platforms. By tailoring nonlinear scale-space
modeling to SHM image alignment, this work offers a robust and physically
grounded alternative to conventional techniques for tracking real-world crack
evolution.

Conclusion: 本研究首次全面评估计数置信度，并通过模型量化影响因素与置信度的关系，为精准农业决策提供支持。

Abstract: Accurate pest population monitoring and tracking their dynamic changes are
crucial for precision agriculture decision-making. A common limitation in
existing vision-based automatic pest counting research is that models are
typically evaluated on datasets with ground truth but deployed in real-world
scenarios without assessing the reliability of counting results due to the lack
of ground truth. To this end, this paper proposed a method for comprehensively
evaluating pest counting confidence in the image, based on information related
to counting results and external environmental conditions. First, a pest
detection network is used for pest detection and counting, extracting counting
result-related information. Then, the pest images undergo image quality
assessment, image complexity assessment, and pest distribution uniformity
assessment. And the changes in image clarity caused by stirring during image
acquisition are quantified by calculating the average gradient magnitude.
Notably, we designed a hypothesis-driven multi-factor sensitivity analysis
method to select the optimal image quality assessment and image complexity
assessment methods. And we proposed an adaptive DBSCAN clustering algorithm for
pest distribution uniformity assessment. Finally, the obtained information
related to counting results and external environmental conditions is input into
a regression model for prediction, resulting in the final pest counting
confidence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study dedicated to
comprehensively evaluating counting confidence in counting tasks, and
quantifying the relationship between influencing factors and counting
confidence through a model. Experimental results show our method reduces MSE by
31.7% and improves R2 by 15.2% on the pest counting confidence test set,
compared to the baseline built primarily on information related to counting
results.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models, but their high
computation cost in iterative sampling remains a significant bottleneck. In
this work, we present an in-depth and insightful study of state-of-the-art
acceleration techniques for diffusion models, including caching and
quantization, revealing their limitations in computation error and generation
quality. To break these limits, this work introduces Modulated Diffusion
(MoDiff), an innovative, rigorous, and principled framework that accelerates
generative modeling through modulated quantization and error compensation.
MoDiff not only inherents the advantages of existing caching and quantization
methods but also serves as a general framework to accelerate all diffusion
models. The advantages of MoDiff are supported by solid theoretical insight and
analysis. In addition, extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and LSUN demonstrate
that MoDiff significant reduces activation quantization from 8 bits to 3 bits
without performance degradation in post-training quantization (PTQ). Our code
implementation is available at https://github.com/WeizhiGao/MoDiff.

Result: 在真实数据集上达到0.885准确率和0.794 F1分数，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 基于图像融合的负载信号分类方法实用且有效，适用于实时、隐私保护的跌倒预防。

Abstract: Bed-related falls remain a leading source of injury in hospitals and
long-term-care facilities, yet many commercial alarms trigger only after a
patient has already left the bed. We show that early bed-exit intent can be
predicted using only four low-cost load cells mounted under the bed legs. The
resulting load signals are first converted into a compact set of complementary
images: an RGB line plot that preserves raw waveforms and three texture maps -
recurrence plot, Markov transition field, and Gramian angular field - that
expose higher-order dynamics. We introduce ViFusionTST, a dual-stream Swin
Transformer that processes the line plot and texture maps in parallel and fuses
them through cross-attention to learn data-driven modality weights.
  To provide a realistic benchmark, we collected six months of continuous data
from 95 beds in a long-term-care facility. On this real-world dataset
ViFusionTST reaches an accuracy of 0.885 and an F1 score of 0.794, surpassing
recent 1D and 2D time-series baselines across F1, recall, accuracy, and AUPRC.
The results demonstrate that image-based fusion of load-sensor signals for time
series classification is a practical and effective solution for real-time,
privacy-preserving fall prevention.

Abstract: This study presents a novel integrated framework for dynamic
origin-destination demand estimation (DODE) in multi-class mesoscopic network
models, leveraging high-resolution satellite imagery together with conventional
traffic data from local sensors. Unlike sparse local detectors, satellite
imagery offers consistent, city-wide road and traffic information of both
parking and moving vehicles, overcoming data availability limitations. To
extract information from imagery data, we design a computer vision pipeline for
class-specific vehicle detection and map matching, generating link-level
traffic density observations by vehicle class. Building upon this information,
we formulate a computational graph-based DODE model that calibrates dynamic
network states by jointly matching observed traffic counts and travel times
from local sensors with density measurements derived from satellite imagery. To
assess the accuracy and scalability of the proposed framework, we conduct a
series of numerical experiments using both synthetic and real-world data. The
results of out-of-sample tests demonstrate that supplementing traditional data
with satellite-derived density significantly improves estimation performance,
especially for links without local sensors. Real-world experiments also confirm
the framework's capability to handle large-scale networks, supporting its
potential for practical deployment in cities of varying sizes. Sensitivity
analysis further evaluates the impact of data quality related to satellite
imagery data.

Motivation: 手术风险识别对患者安全至关重要，但现有模型在视觉安全违规识别上存在视觉-语义知识冲突（VS-KC），需要解决这一问题。

Method: 通过扩散模型生成34,000张合成图像和214张人工标注图像，构建OR-VSKC数据集，用于微调多模态大语言模型。

Result: 微调后的模型在训练过的冲突实体上表现显著提升，但对未训练实体类型表现不佳，显示学习特异性。

Conclusion: OR-VSKC数据集和基准测试为研究VS-KC提供了资源，未来需更全面的训练以提升模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Surgical risk identification is critical for patient safety and reducing
preventable medical errors. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show
promise for automated operating room (OR) risk detection, they often exhibit
visual-semantic knowledge conflicts (VS-KC), failing to identify visual safety
violations despite understanding textual rules. To address this, we introduce a
dataset comprising over 34,000 synthetic images generated by diffusion models,
depicting operating room scenes containing entities that violate established
safety rules. These images were created to alleviate data scarcity and examine
MLLMs vulnerabilities. In addition, the dataset includes 214 human-annotated
images that serve as a gold-standard reference for validation. This
comprehensive dataset, spanning diverse perspectives, stages, and
configurations, is designed to expose and study VS-KC. Fine-tuning on OR-VSKC
significantly improves MLLMs' detection of trained conflict entities and
generalizes well to new viewpoints for these entities, but performance on
untrained entity types remains poor, highlighting learning specificity and the
need for comprehensive training. The main contributions of this work include:
(1) a data generation methodology tailored for rule-violation scenarios; (2)
the release of the OR-VSKC dataset and its associated benchmark as open-source
resources; and (3) an empirical analysis of violation-sensitive knowledge
consistency in representative MLLMs. The dataset and appendix are available at

combines spatial awareness with contextual understanding, improving both

Abstract: Data analysis plays an increasingly important role in soccer, offering new
ways to evaluate individual and team performance. One specific application is
the evaluation of dribbles: one-on-one situations where an attacker attempts to
bypass a defender with the ball. While previous research has primarily relied
on 2D positional tracking data, this fails to capture aspects like balance,
orientation, and ball control, limiting the depth of current insights. This
study explores how pose tracking data (capturing players' posture and movement
in three dimensions) can improve our understanding of dribbling skills. We
extract novel pose-based features from 1,736 dribbles in the 2022/23 Champions
League season and evaluate their impact on dribble success. Our results
indicate that features capturing the attacker's balance and the alignment of
the orientation between the attacker and defender are informative for
predicting dribble success. Incorporating these pose-based features on top of
features derived from traditional 2D positional data leads to a measurable
improvement in model performance.

Abstract: Detecting brain lesions as abnormalities observed in magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) is essential for diagnosis and treatment. In the search of
abnormalities, such as tumors and malformations, radiologists may benefit from
computer-aided diagnostics that use computer vision systems trained with
machine learning to segment normal tissue from abnormal brain tissue. While
supervised learning methods require annotated lesions, we propose a new
unsupervised approach (Patch2Loc) that learns from normal patches taken from
structural MRI. We train a neural network model to map a patch back to its
spatial location within a slice of the brain volume. During inference, abnormal
patches are detected by the relatively higher error and/or variance of the
location prediction. This generates a heatmap that can be integrated into
pixel-wise methods to achieve finer-grained segmentation. We demonstrate the
ability of our model to segment abnormal brain tissues by applying our approach
to the detection of tumor tissues in MRI on T2-weighted images from BraTS2021
and MSLUB datasets and T1-weighted images from ATLAS and WMH datasets. We show
that it outperforms the state-of-the art in unsupervised segmentation. The

Abstract: As a computer vision task, automatic object segmentation remains challenging
in specialized image domains without massive labeled data, such as synthetic
aperture sonar images, remote sensing, biomedical imaging, etc. In any domain,
obtaining pixel-wise segmentation masks is expensive. In this work, we propose
a method for training a masking network to perform binary object segmentation
using weak supervision in the form of image-wise presence or absence of an
object of interest, which provides less information but may be obtained more
quickly from manual or automatic labeling. A key step in our method is that the
segmented objects can be placed into background-only images to create
realistic, images of the objects with counterfactual backgrounds. To create a
contrast between the original and counterfactual background images, we propose
to first cluster the background-only images, and then during learning create
counterfactual images that blend objects segmented from their original source
backgrounds to backgrounds chosen from a targeted cluster. One term in the
training loss is the divergence between these counterfactual images and the
real object images with backgrounds of the target cluster. The other term is a
supervised loss for background-only images. While an adversarial critic could
provide the divergence, we use sample-based divergences. We conduct experiments
on side-scan and synthetic aperture sonar in which our approach succeeds
compared to previous unsupervised segmentation baselines that were only tested
on natural images. Furthermore, to show generality we extend our experiments to
natural images, obtaining reasonable performance with our method that avoids
pretrained networks, generative networks, and adversarial critics. The basecode

Conclusion: DNA方法无需训练即可实现扩散模型的域适应，为密集预测任务提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Domain Adaptation(DA) for dense prediction tasks is an important topic, which
enhances the dense prediction model's performance when tested on its unseen
domain. Recently, with the development of Diffusion-based Dense Prediction
(DDP) models, the exploration of DA designs tailored to this framework is worth
exploring, since the diffusion model is effective in modeling the distribution
transformation that comprises domain information. In this work, we propose a
training-free mechanism for DDP frameworks, endowing them with DA capabilities.
Our motivation arises from the observation that the exposure bias (e.g., noise
statistics bias) in diffusion brings domain shift, and different domains in
conditions of DDP models can also be effectively captured by the noise
prediction statistics. Based on this, we propose a training-free Domain Noise
Alignment (DNA) approach, which alleviates the variations of noise statistics
to domain changes during the diffusion sampling process, thereby achieving
domain adaptation. Specifically, when the source domain is available, we
directly adopt the DNA method to achieve domain adaptation by aligning the
noise statistics of the target domain with those of the source domain. For the
more challenging source-free DA, inspired by the observation that regions
closer to the source domain exhibit higher confidence meeting variations of
sampling noise, we utilize the statistics from the high-confidence regions
progressively to guide the noise statistic adjustment during the sampling
process. Notably, our method demonstrates the effectiveness of enhancing the DA
capability of DDP models across four common dense prediction tasks. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于夜间缺乏可见光数据，无法实现全天候气象观测，研究旨在解决这一限制。

Method: 基于FY4B卫星的AGRI多波段热红外数据，开发了生成扩散模型RefDiff，实现夜间可见光反射率检索。

Result: RefDiff的SSIM指数达0.90，在复杂云结构和厚云区域表现尤为突出，夜间检索能力与白天相当。

Conclusion: 研究显著提升了夜间可见光反射率检索能力，拓展了夜间可见光数据的应用潜力。

Abstract: The visible light reflectance data from geostationary satellites is crucial
for meteorological observations and plays an important role in weather
monitoring and forecasting. However, due to the lack of visible light at night,
it is impossible to conduct continuous all-day weather observations using
visible light reflectance data. This study pioneers the use of generative
diffusion models to address this limitation. Based on the multi-band thermal
infrared brightness temperature data from the Advanced Geostationary Radiation
Imager (AGRI) onboard the Fengyun-4B (FY4B) geostationary satellite, we
developed a high-precision visible light reflectance retrieval model, called
Reflectance Diffusion (RefDiff), which enables 0.47~\mu\mathrm{m},
0.65~\mu\mathrm{m}, and 0.825~\mu\mathrm{m} bands visible light reflectance
retrieval at night. Compared to the classical models, RefDiff not only
significantly improves accuracy through ensemble averaging but also provides
uncertainty estimation. Specifically, the SSIM index of RefDiff can reach 0.90,
with particularly significant improvements in areas with complex cloud
structures and thick clouds. The model's nighttime retrieval capability was
validated using VIIRS nighttime product, demonstrating comparable performance
to its daytime counterpart. In summary, this research has made substantial
progress in the ability to retrieve visible light reflectance at night, with
the potential to expand the application of nighttime visible light data.

Conclusion: 该框架在实际测试中表现出潜力，可作为支持工具，不受设备和软件限制。

Abstract: This investigation attempts to create an automated framework for fault
detection and organization for usage in contemporary radiography, as per NDE
4.0. The review's goals are to address the lack of information that is
sufficiently explained, learn how to make the most of virtual defect increase,
and determine whether the framework is viable by using NDE measurements. As its
basic information source, the technique consists of compiling and categorizing
223 CR photographs of airplane welds. Information expansion systems, such as
virtual defect increase and standard increase, are used to work on the
preparation dataset. A modified U-net model is prepared using the improved data
to produce semantic fault division veils. To assess the effectiveness of the
model, NDE boundaries such as Case, estimating exactness, and misleading call
rate are used. Tiny a90/95 characteristics, which provide strong
differentiating evidence of flaws, reveal that the suggested approach achieves
exceptional awareness in defect detection. Considering a 90/95, size error, and
fake call rate in the weld area, the consolidated expansion approach clearly
wins. Due to the framework's fast derivation speed, large images can be broken
down efficiently and quickly. Professional controllers evaluate the transmitted
system in the field and believe that it has a guarantee as a support device in
the testing cycle, irrespective of particular equipment cut-off points and
programming resemblance.

Method: 使用278张标注图像训练和测试三种模型，比较其mAP和精度。

Result: Yolov11和12的mAP@50为81.9%，RF-DETR为77.7%，但RF-DETR在罕见损坏检测中表现更优。

Conclusion: RF-DETR在集装箱损坏检测中更具优势，尤其在罕见损坏场景下。

Abstract: Containers are an integral part of the logistics industry and act as a
barrier for cargo. A typical service life for a container is more than 20
years. However, overtime containers suffer various types of damage due to the
mechanical as well as natural factors. A damaged container is a safety hazard
for the employees handling it and a liability for the logistic company.
Therefore, a timely inspection and detection of the damaged container is a key
for prolonging service life as well as avoiding safety hazards. In this paper,
we will compare the performance of the damage detection by three
state-of-the-art advanced computer vision models Yolov12, Yolov11 and RF-DETR.
We will use a dataset of 278 annotated images to train, validate and test the
model. We will compare the mAP and precision of the model. The objective of
this paper is to identify the model that is best suited for container damage
detection. The result is mixed. mAP@50 score of Yolov11 and 12 was 81.9%
compared to RF-DETR, which was 77.7%. However, while testing the model for
not-so-common damaged containers, the RF-DETR model outperformed the others
overall, exhibiting superiority to accurately detecting both damaged containers
as well as damage occurrences with high confidence.

Motivation: 现有方法在多对象保留、语义对齐和场景控制方面存在不足，需要一种更高效的方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 采用N-channel ControlNet，结合对象保留模块、背景引导模块和高频覆盖模块，确保细节保留和语义一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法在多对象保留和语义一致性方面表现优异，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: We introduce \textit{Preserve Anything}, a novel method for controlled image
synthesis that addresses key limitations in object preservation and semantic
consistency in text-to-image (T2I) generation. Existing approaches often fail
(i) to preserve multiple objects with fidelity, (ii) maintain semantic
alignment with prompts, or (iii) provide explicit control over scene
composition. To overcome these challenges, the proposed method employs an
N-channel ControlNet that integrates (i) object preservation with size and
placement agnosticism, color and detail retention, and artifact elimination,
(ii) high-resolution, semantically consistent backgrounds with accurate
shadows, lighting, and prompt adherence, and (iii) explicit user control over
background layouts and lighting conditions. Key components of our framework
include object preservation and background guidance modules, enforcing lighting
consistency and a high-frequency overlay module to retain fine details while
mitigating unwanted artifacts. We introduce a benchmark dataset consisting of
240K natural images filtered for aesthetic quality and 18K 3D-rendered
synthetic images with metadata such as lighting, camera angles, and object
relationships. This dataset addresses the deficiencies of existing benchmarks
and allows a complete evaluation. Empirical results demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving feature-space
fidelity (FID 15.26) and semantic alignment (CLIP-S 32.85) while maintaining
competitive aesthetic quality. We also conducted a user study to demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed work on unseen benchmark and observed a remarkable
improvement of $\sim25\%$, $\sim19\%$, $\sim13\%$, and $\sim14\%$ in terms of
prompt alignment, photorealism, the presence of AI artifacts, and natural
aesthetics over existing works.

Abstract: Human communication involves a complex interplay of verbal and nonverbal

develop socially intelligent AI technologies, it is crucial to develop models
that can both comprehend and generate dyadic behavioral dynamics. To this end,
we introduce the Seamless Interaction Dataset, a large-scale collection of over
4,000 hours of face-to-face interaction footage from over 4,000 participants in
diverse contexts. This dataset enables the development of AI technologies that
understand dyadic embodied dynamics, unlocking breakthroughs in virtual agents,
telepresence experiences, and multimodal content analysis tools. We also
develop a suite of models that utilize the dataset to generate dyadic motion
gestures and facial expressions aligned with human speech. These models can
take as input both the speech and visual behavior of their interlocutors. We
present a variant with speech from an LLM model and integrations with 2D and 3D
rendering methods, bringing us closer to interactive virtual agents.
Additionally, we describe controllable variants of our motion models that can
adapt emotional responses and expressivity levels, as well as generating more
semantically-relevant gestures. Finally, we discuss methods for assessing the
quality of these dyadic motion models, which are demonstrating the potential
for more intuitive and responsive human-AI interactions.

Conclusion: 该方法通过序列化表示和3D输出，显著提升了视频目标检测性能，但受限于计算资源。

Abstract: This paper improves upon the Pix2Seq object detector by extending it for
videos. In the process, it introduces a new way to perform end-to-end video
object detection that improves upon existing video detectors in two key ways.
First, by representing objects as variable-length sequences of discrete tokens,
we can succinctly represent widely varying numbers of video objects, with
diverse shapes and locations, without having to inject any localization cues in
the training process. This eliminates the need to sample the space of all
possible boxes that constrains conventional detectors and thus solves the dual
problems of loss sparsity during training and heuristics-based postprocessing
during inference. Second, it conceptualizes and outputs the video objects as
fully integrated and indivisible 3D boxes or tracklets instead of generating
image-specific 2D boxes and linking these boxes together to construct the video
object, as done in most conventional detectors. This allows it to scale
effortlessly with available computational resources by simply increasing the
length of the video subsequence that the network takes as input, even
generalizing to multi-object tracking if the subsequence can span the entire
video. We compare our video detector with the baseline Pix2Seq static detector
on several datasets and demonstrate consistent improvement, although with
strong signs of being bottlenecked by our limited computational resources. We
also compare it with several video detectors on UA-DETRAC to show that it is
competitive with the current state of the art even with the computational
bottleneck. We make our code and models publicly available.

TL;DR: MMKD-CLIP通过多教师知识蒸馏构建高性能生物医学基础模型，解决了数据稀缺和异构性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学领域缺乏大规模图像-文本对数据，且数据模态和标准不统一，阻碍了通用基础模型的开发。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：1) 在290万生物医学图像-文本对上预训练；2) 从9个教师模型中提取1920万特征对进行特征级蒸馏。

Result: 在58个数据集上评估，涵盖1080万图像和9种模态，MMKD-CLIP在所有任务中均优于教师模型。

Conclusion: 多教师知识蒸馏是构建高性能生物医学基础模型的有效方法。

Abstract: CLIP models pretrained on natural images with billion-scale image-text pairs
have demonstrated impressive capabilities in zero-shot classification,
cross-modal retrieval, and open-ended visual answering. However, transferring
this success to biomedicine is hindered by the scarcity of large-scale
biomedical image-text corpora, the heterogeneity of image modalities, and
fragmented data standards across institutions. These limitations hinder the
development of a unified and generalizable biomedical foundation model trained
from scratch. To overcome this, we introduce MMKD-CLIP, a generalist biomedical
foundation model developed via Multiple Medical CLIP Knowledge Distillation.
Rather than relying on billion-scale raw data, MMKD-CLIP distills knowledge
from nine state-of-the-art domain-specific or generalist biomedical CLIP
models, each pretrained on millions of biomedical image-text pairs. Our
two-stage training pipeline first performs CLIP-style pretraining on over 2.9
million biomedical image-text pairs from 26 image modalities, followed by
feature-level distillation using over 19.2 million feature pairs extracted from
teacher models. We evaluate MMKD-CLIP on 58 diverse biomedical datasets,
encompassing over 10.8 million biomedical images across nine image modalities.
The evaluation spans six core task types: zero-shot classification, linear
probing, cross-modal retrieval, visual question answering, survival prediction,
and cancer diagnosis. MMKD-CLIP consistently outperforms all teacher models
while demonstrating remarkable robustness and generalization across image
domains and task settings. These results underscore that multi-teacher
knowledge distillation is a scalable and effective paradigm for building
high-performing biomedical foundation models under the practical constraints of
real-world data availability.

Abstract: Agricultural image semantic segmentation is a pivotal component of modern
agriculture, facilitating accurate visual data analysis to improve crop
management, optimize resource utilization, and boost overall productivity. This
study proposes an efficient image segmentation method for precision
agriculture, focusing on accurately delineating farmland anomalies to support
informed decision-making and proactive interventions. A novel Dual Atrous
Separable Convolution (DAS Conv) module is integrated within the
DeepLabV3-based segmentation framework. The DAS Conv module is meticulously
designed to achieve an optimal balance between dilation rates and padding size,
thereby enhancing model performance without compromising efficiency. The study
also incorporates a strategic skip connection from an optimal stage in the
encoder to the decoder to bolster the model's capacity to capture fine-grained
spatial features. Despite its lower computational complexity, the proposed
model outperforms its baseline and achieves performance comparable to highly
complex transformer-based state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the Agriculture
Vision benchmark dataset. It achieves more than 66% improvement in efficiency
when considering the trade-off between model complexity and performance,
compared to the SOTA model. This study highlights an efficient and effective
solution for improving semantic segmentation in remote sensing applications,
offering a computationally lightweight model capable of high-quality
performance in agricultural imagery.

Motivation: 历史地图上的文本信息对多学科研究至关重要，但现有方法难以有效链接文本片段，尤其是忽略了几何信息。

Method: LIGHT整合了语言、图像和几何特征，通过几何感知嵌入模块捕获文本区域的多边形坐标和空间位置，并与LayoutLMv3的视觉和语言嵌入结合。

Result: LIGHT在ICDAR 2024/2025 MapText竞赛数据上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 多模态学习对历史地图文本链接有效，LIGHT展示了其优势。

Abstract: Text on historical maps provides valuable information for studies in history,
economics, geography, and other related fields. Unlike structured or
semi-structured documents, text on maps varies significantly in orientation,
reading order, shape, and placement. Many modern methods can detect and
transcribe text regions, but they struggle to effectively ``link'' the
recognized text fragments, e.g., determining a multi-word place name. Existing
layout analysis methods model word relationships to improve text understanding
in structured documents, but they primarily rely on linguistic features and
neglect geometric information, which is essential for handling map text. To
address these challenges, we propose LIGHT, a novel multi-modal approach that
integrates linguistic, image, and geometric features for linking text on
historical maps. In particular, LIGHT includes a geometry-aware embedding
module that encodes the polygonal coordinates of text regions to capture
polygon shapes and their relative spatial positions on an image. LIGHT unifies
this geometric information with the visual and linguistic token embeddings from
LayoutLMv3, a pretrained layout analysis model. LIGHT uses the cross-modal
information to predict the reading-order successor of each text instance
directly with a bi-directional learning strategy that enhances sequence
robustness. Experimental results show that LIGHT outperforms existing methods

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: BrainMT采用两阶段设计：1）双向Mamba块捕捉全局时间交互；2）Transformer块建模空间关系。

Result: 在UKBioBank和Human Connectome Project数据集上，BrainMT在分类（性别预测）和回归（认知预测）任务中表现最优。

Conclusion: BrainMT通过高效建模时空依赖，显著优于现有方法，代码将公开。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have made it possible to predict phenotypic
measures directly from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain
volumes, sparking significant interest in the neuroimaging community. However,
existing approaches, primarily based on convolutional neural networks or
transformer architectures, often struggle to model the complex relationships
inherent in fMRI data, limited by their inability to capture long-range spatial
and temporal dependencies. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce
BrainMT, a novel hybrid framework designed to efficiently learn and integrate
long-range spatiotemporal attributes in fMRI data. Our framework operates in
two stages: (1) a bidirectional Mamba block with a temporal-first scanning
mechanism to capture global temporal interactions in a computationally
efficient manner; and (2) a transformer block leveraging self-attention to
model global spatial relationships across the deep features processed by the
Mamba block. Extensive experiments on two large-scale public datasets,
UKBioBank and the Human Connectome Project, demonstrate that BrainMT achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both classification (sex prediction) and
regression (cognitive intelligence prediction) tasks, outperforming existing
methods by a significant margin. Our code and implementation details will be
made publicly available at this

TL;DR: Seg-R1利用强化学习增强多模态模型的像素级理解能力，通过GRPO策略在分割任务中表现优异，并在零样本任务中展现强大泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索强化学习在多模态模型像素级理解中的应用，提升模型在分割任务中的表现和泛化能力。

Method: 采用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)策略，通过强化学习训练模型生成点提示和边界框提示，指导SAM2生成分割掩码。

Result: 在COD10K上达到0.873 S-measure，零样本任务中RefCOCOg测试集71.4 cIoU，ReasonSeg测试集56.7 gIoU，优于全监督模型。

Conclusion: Seg-R1展示了纯强化学习训练在多模态模型分割任务中的潜力，尤其在零样本泛化方面表现突出。

Abstract: We present Seg-R1, a preliminary exploration of using reinforcement learning
(RL) to enhance the pixel-level understanding and reasoning capabilities of
large multimodal models (LMMs). Starting with foreground segmentation tasks,
specifically camouflaged object detection (COD) and salient object detection
(SOD), our approach enables the LMM to generate point and bounding box prompts
in the next-token fashion, which are then used to guide SAM2 in producing
segmentation masks. We introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) into
the segmentation domain, equipping the LMM with pixel-level comprehension
through a carefully designed training strategy. Notably, Seg-R1 achieves
remarkable performance with purely RL-based training, achieving .873 S-measure
on COD10K without complex model modification. Moreover, we found that pure RL
training demonstrates strong open-world generalization. Despite being trained
solely on foreground segmentation image-mask pairs without text supervision,
Seg-R1 achieves impressive zero-shot performance on referring segmentation and
reasoning segmentation tasks, with 71.4 cIoU on RefCOCOg test and 56.7 gIoU on
ReasonSeg test, outperforming models fully supervised on these datasets.

### [106] [ReCo: Reminder Composition Mitigates Hallucinations in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22636)
*Sotirios Panagiotis Chytas,Miso Choi,Hyunwoo J. Kim,Vikas Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ReCo的轻量级模块，用于缓解视觉语言模型（VLMs）中的幻觉问题，通过几何代数和关系组合的方法，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）在生成文本时容易产生幻觉（即生成与视觉输入无关或矛盾的文本），主要原因是模型对语言的过度依赖导致视觉输入的‘记忆消退效应’。

Method: 提出了一种基于几何代数和关系组合的小型可训练模块ReCo，无需修改现有VLM结构，直接加在模型顶部。

Result: 在三种广泛使用的VLMs（InstructBLIP、LlaVA、MiniGPT4）上，ReCo模块显著缓解了记忆消退效应，并在多个基准测试中提升了性能。此外，ReCo还能与其他减少幻觉的方法结合使用，进一步提升效果。

Conclusion: ReCo模块是一种简单有效的解决方案，能够显著减少VLMs中的幻觉问题，且兼容性强，易于与其他方法结合使用。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) show impressive capabilities in integrating and
reasoning with both visual and language data. But these models make mistakes. A
common finding -- similar to LLMs -- is their tendency to hallucinate, i.e.,
generate plausible sounding text which is not grounded in the visual input, or
at worst, is contradictory. A growing consensus attributes this behavior to an
over-reliance on language -- especially as the generation progresses, the model
suffers from a ``fading memory effect'' with respect to the provided visual
input. We study mechanisms by which this behavior can be controlled.
Specifically, using ideas from geometric algebra and relational compositions,
we propose the addition of a small, trainable module (named ReCo) on top of any
VLM -- no other modification is needed. We show that such a lightweight module
is able to mitigate the fading memory effect on three of the most widely used
VLMs (InstructBLIP, LlaVA, MiniGPT4), where we see performance improvements on
multiple benchmarks. Additionally, we show that our module can be combined with
many of the other approaches for reducing hallucination where we achieve
improved results for each one.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CaO$_2$的两阶段扩散框架，解决了当前扩散模型在数据集蒸馏中的目标不一致和条件不一致问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散模型的数据集蒸馏方法存在目标不一致和条件不一致的问题，影响了蒸馏效果。

Method: 提出CaO$_2$框架，分为两阶段：第一阶段采用概率信息样本选择管道，第二阶段优化潜在表示以提高条件似然。

Result: 在ImageNet及其子集上表现优异，平均准确率超过基线方法2.3%。

Conclusion: CaO$_2$通过优化目标一致性和条件一致性，显著提升了数据集蒸馏的性能。

Abstract: The recent introduction of diffusion models in dataset distillation has shown
promising potential in creating compact surrogate datasets for large,
high-resolution target datasets, offering improved efficiency and performance
over traditional bi-level/uni-level optimization methods. However, current
diffusion-based dataset distillation approaches overlook the evaluation process
and exhibit two critical inconsistencies in the distillation process: (1)
Objective Inconsistency, where the distillation process diverges from the
evaluation objective, and (2) Condition Inconsistency, leading to mismatches
between generated images and their corresponding conditions. To resolve these
issues, we introduce Condition-aware Optimization with Objective-guided
Sampling (CaO$_2$), a two-stage diffusion-based framework that aligns the
distillation process with the evaluation objective. The first stage employs a
probability-informed sample selection pipeline, while the second stage refines
the corresponding latent representations to improve conditional likelihood.
CaO$_2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet and its subsets,
surpassing the best-performing baselines by an average of 2.3% accuracy.

Motivation: 现有盲超分辨率方法忽视了IDR判别性的重要性，过度复杂化了适应过程，导致模型参数和计算量大幅增加。本文旨在优化IDR判别性，设计高效轻量模型。

Method: 采用知识蒸馏框架：1）教师阶段使用退化先验约束的对比学习技术，增强模型对不同退化类型的区分能力；2）学生阶段通过特征对齐技术转移退化相关知识。

Result: 实验表明，LightBSR在多种盲超分辨率任务中表现出色，且复杂度极低。

Conclusion: 优化IDR判别性可显著提升盲超分辨率模型性能，LightBSR为轻量高效的设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Implicit degradation estimation-based blind super-resolution (IDE-BSR) hinges
on extracting the implicit degradation representation (IDR) of the LR image and
adapting it to LR image features to guide HR detail restoration. Although
IDE-BSR has shown potential in dealing with noise interference and complex
degradations, existing methods ignore the importance of IDR discriminability
for BSR and instead over-complicate the adaptation process to improve effect,
resulting in a significant increase in the model's parameters and computations.
In this paper, we focus on the discriminability optimization of IDR and propose
a new powerful and lightweight BSR model termed LightBSR. Specifically, we
employ a knowledge distillation-based learning framework. We first introduce a
well-designed degradation-prior-constrained contrastive learning technique
during teacher stage to make the model more focused on distinguishing different
degradation types. Then we utilize a feature alignment technique to transfer
the degradation-related knowledge acquired by the teacher to the student for
practical inferencing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
IDR discriminability-driven BSR model design. The proposed LightBSR can achieve
outstanding performance with minimal complexity across a range of blind SR
tasks. Our code is accessible at: https://github.com/MJ-NCEPU/LightBSR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态点云序列中部分分割和运动估计的挑战，特别是在点云非固定采样或存在遮挡的情况下。

Method: 使用3D高斯作为基本构建块，参数化时间依赖的旋转、平移和尺度，建立点与高斯之间的对应关系。

Result: 在遮挡场景下，部分分割性能优于现有方法13%，且对缺失点更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 该方法在动态点云分析中表现出色，尤其在遮挡和异步采集场景下优于依赖点对应的方法。

Abstract: Part segmentation and motion estimation are two fundamental problems for
articulated object motion analysis. In this paper, we present a method to solve
these two problems jointly from a sequence of observed point clouds of a single
articulated object. The main challenge in our problem setting is that the point
clouds are not assumed to be generated by a fixed set of moving points.
Instead, each point cloud in the sequence could be an arbitrary sampling of the
object surface at that particular time step. Such scenarios occur when the
object undergoes major occlusions, or if the dataset is collected using
measurements from multiple sensors asynchronously. In these scenarios, methods
that rely on tracking point correspondences are not appropriate. We present an
alternative approach based on a compact but effective representation where we
represent the object as a collection of simple building blocks modeled as 3D
Gaussians. We parameterize the Gaussians with time-dependent rotations,
translations, and scales that are shared across all time steps. With our
representation, part segmentation can be achieved by building correspondences
between the observed points and the Gaussians. Moreover, the transformation of
each point across time can be obtained by following the poses of the assigned
Gaussian (even when the point is not observed). Experiments show that our
method outperforms existing methods that solely rely on finding point
correspondences. Additionally, we extend existing datasets to emulate
real-world scenarios by considering viewpoint occlusions. We further
demonstrate that our method is more robust to missing points as compared to
existing approaches on these challenging datasets, even when some parts are
completely occluded in some time-steps. Notably, our part segmentation
performance outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 13% on point clouds with
occlusions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种确定性高效的方法，用于估计6D姿态置信区域，解决了采样方法速度慢和置信区域过大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于采样的6D姿态置信区域估计方法存在速度慢和置信区域过大的问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用归纳共形预测校准回归的高斯关键点分布，并通过隐函数定理直接传播到6D姿态置信区域。

Result: 在LineMOD Occlusion和SPEED数据集上，方法提高了姿态估计精度，减少了计算时间，置信区域体积显著减小（旋转减少99.9%，平移减少99.8%）。

Conclusion: 该方法避免了采样的低效性，提供了紧凑的置信区域，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: 6D pose confidence region estimation has emerged as a critical direction,
aiming to perform uncertainty quantification for assessing the reliability of
estimated poses. However, current sampling-based approach suffers from critical
limitations that severely impede their practical deployment: 1) the sampling
speed significantly decreases as the number of samples increases. 2) the
derived confidence regions are often excessively large. To address these
challenges, we propose a deterministic and efficient method for estimating pose
confidence regions. Our approach uses inductive conformal prediction to
calibrate the deterministically regressed Gaussian keypoint distributions into
2D keypoint confidence regions. We then leverage the implicit function theorem
to propagate these keypoint confidence regions directly into 6D pose confidence
regions. This method avoids the inefficiency and inflated region sizes
associated with sampling and ensembling. It provides compact confidence regions
that cover the ground-truth poses with a user-defined confidence level.
Experimental results on the LineMOD Occlusion and SPEED datasets show that our
method achieves higher pose estimation accuracy with reduced computational
time. For the same coverage rate, our method yields significantly smaller
confidence region volumes, reducing them by up to 99.9\% for rotations and
99.8\% for translations. The code will be available soon.

Motivation: 边缘系统中深度学习模型的训练和开发受限于传感器数据稀缺和资源限制，现有方法存在模态偏移和高资源需求的问题。

Method: XTransfer通过模型修复（修复模态偏移）和层重组（高效搜索和重组源模型层）实现资源高效的模型迁移。

Result: XTransfer在多种人类感知任务中达到最先进性能，显著降低数据收集、训练和部署成本。

Conclusion: XTransfer为边缘系统中的人类感知任务提供了一种高效、适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning for human sensing on edge systems offers significant
opportunities for smart applications. However, its training and development are
hindered by the limited availability of sensor data and resource constraints of
edge systems. Current methods that rely on transferring pre-trained models
often encounter issues such as modality shift and high resource demands,
resulting in substantial accuracy loss, resource overhead, and poor
adaptability across different sensing applications. In this paper, we propose
XTransfer, a first-of-its-kind method for resource-efficient, modality-agnostic
model transfer. XTransfer freely leverages single or multiple pre-trained
models and transfers knowledge across different modalities by (i) model
repairing that safely repairs modality shift in pre-trained model layers with
only few sensor data, and (ii) layer recombining that efficiently searches and
recombines layers of interest from source models in a layer-wise manner to
create compact models. We benchmark various baselines across diverse human
sensing datasets spanning different modalities. Comprehensive results
demonstrate that XTransfer achieves state-of-the-art performance on human
sensing tasks while significantly reducing the costs of sensor data collection,
model training, and edge deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设源图像高质量且对齐，实际应用中效果因未对齐或退化而下降，需统一框架解决这些问题。

Method: 嵌入退化感知提示学习模块，设计Omni统一特征表示方案和通用特征恢复与融合模块，利用ALSN实现联合优化。

Result: 实验证明UniFuse在多数据集上优于现有方法，有效统一对齐、恢复和融合任务。

Conclusion: UniFuse通过统一框架显著提升多模态医学图像融合效果，适用于实际复杂场景。

Abstract: Current multimodal medical image fusion typically assumes that source images
are of high quality and perfectly aligned at the pixel level. Its effectiveness
heavily relies on these conditions and often deteriorates when handling
misaligned or degraded medical images. To address this, we propose UniFuse, a
general fusion framework. By embedding a degradation-aware prompt learning
module, UniFuse seamlessly integrates multi-directional information from input
images and correlates cross-modal alignment with restoration, enabling joint
optimization of both tasks within a unified framework. Additionally, we design
an Omni Unified Feature Representation scheme, which leverages Spatial Mamba to
encode multi-directional features and mitigate modality differences in feature
alignment. To enable simultaneous restoration and fusion within an All-in-One
configuration, we propose a Universal Feature Restoration & Fusion module,
incorporating the Adaptive LoRA Synergistic Network (ALSN) based on LoRA
principles. By leveraging ALSN's adaptive feature representation along with
degradation-type guidance, we enable joint restoration and fusion within a
single-stage framework. Compared to staged approaches, UniFuse unifies
alignment, restoration, and fusion within a single framework. Experimental
results across multiple datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and
significant advantages over existing approaches.

Motivation: 彩色点云在3D应用中需求广泛，但现有方法在生成大规模高密度点云时效果有限。

Method: 提出JGAU框架，包含几何和属性上采样网络，利用几何辅助信息建模属性相关性，并引入两种粗属性上采样方法和属性增强模块。

Result: 在4倍、8倍、12倍和16倍上采样率下，PSNR分别为33.90、32.10、31.10和30.39分贝，平均提升2.32至2.47分贝。

Conclusion: JGAU方法显著提升了彩色点云上采样的质量，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Colored point cloud, which includes geometry and attribute components, is a
mainstream representation enabling realistic and immersive 3D applications. To
generate large-scale and denser colored point clouds, we propose a deep
learning-based Joint Geometry and Attribute Up-sampling (JGAU) method that
learns to model both geometry and attribute patterns while leveraging spatial
attribute correlations. First, we establish and release a large-scale dataset
for colored point cloud up-sampling called SYSU-PCUD, containing 121
large-scale colored point clouds with diverse geometry and attribute
complexities across six categories and four sampling rates. Second, to improve
the quality of up-sampled point clouds, we propose a deep learning-based JGAU
framework that jointly up-samples geometry and attributes. It consists of a
geometry up-sampling network and an attribute up-sampling network, where the
latter leverages the up-sampled auxiliary geometry to model neighborhood
correlations of the attributes. Third, we propose two coarse attribute
up-sampling methods, Geometric Distance Weighted Attribute Interpolation
(GDWAI) and Deep Learning-based Attribute Interpolation (DLAI), to generate
coarse up-sampled attributes for each point. Then, an attribute enhancement
module is introduced to refine these up-sampled attributes and produce
high-quality point clouds by further exploiting intrinsic attribute and
geometry patterns. Extensive experiments show that the Peak Signal-to-Noise
Ratio (PSNR) achieved by the proposed JGAU method is 33.90 decibels, 32.10
decibels, 31.10 decibels, and 30.39 decibels for up-sampling rates of 4 times,
8 times, 12 times, and 16 times, respectively. Compared to state-of-the-art
methods, JGAU achieves average PSNR gains of 2.32 decibels, 2.47 decibels, 2.28
decibels, and 2.11 decibels at these four up-sampling rates, demonstrating
significant improvement.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法优于现有技术，实现了高保真和锐利的图像重建。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为金属透镜摄影提供了可控的高质量解决方案，无需依赖大规模数据集。

Abstract: Metalenses offer significant potential for ultra-compact computational
imaging but face challenges from complex optical degradation and computational
restoration difficulties. Existing methods typically rely on precise optical
calibration or massive paired datasets, which are non-trivial for real-world
imaging systems. Furthermore, a lack of control over the inference process
often results in undesirable hallucinated artifacts. We introduce
Degradation-Modeled Multipath Diffusion for tunable metalens photography,
leveraging powerful natural image priors from pretrained models instead of
large datasets. Our framework uses positive, neutral, and negative-prompt paths
to balance high-frequency detail generation, structural fidelity, and
suppression of metalens-specific degradation, alongside \textit{pseudo} data
augmentation. A tunable decoder enables controlled trade-offs between fidelity
and perceptual quality. Additionally, a spatially varying degradation-aware
attention (SVDA) module adaptively models complex optical and sensor-induced
degradation. Finally, we design and build a millimeter-scale MetaCamera for
real-world validation. Extensive results show that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving high-fidelity and sharp image
reconstruction. More materials: https://dmdiff.github.io/.

Abstract: The development of generalist robot manipulation policies has seen
significant progress, driven by large-scale demonstration data across diverse
environments. However, the high cost and inefficiency of collecting real-world
demonstrations hinder the scalability of data acquisition. While existing
simulation platforms enable controlled environments for robotic learning, the
challenge of bridging the sim-to-real gap remains. To address these challenges,
we propose RoboPearls, an editable video simulation framework for robotic
manipulation. Built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), RoboPearls enables the
construction of photo-realistic, view-consistent simulations from demonstration
videos, and supports a wide range of simulation operators, including various
object manipulations, powered by advanced modules like Incremental Semantic
Distillation (ISD) and 3D regularized NNFM Loss (3D-NNFM). Moreover, by
incorporating large language models (LLMs), RoboPearls automates the simulation
production process in a user-friendly manner through flexible command
interpretation and execution. Furthermore, RoboPearls employs a vision-language
model (VLM) to analyze robotic learning issues to close the simulation loop for
performance enhancement. To demonstrate the effectiveness of RoboPearls, we
conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets and scenes, including
RLBench, COLOSSEUM, Ego4D, Open X-Embodiment, and a real-world robot, which
demonstrate our satisfactory simulation performance.

Conclusion: VSRM为视频超分辨率提供了新思路，未来研究可基于此框架进一步探索。

Abstract: Video super-resolution remains a major challenge in low-level vision tasks.
To date, CNN- and Transformer-based methods have delivered impressive results.
However, CNNs are limited by local receptive fields, while Transformers
struggle with quadratic complexity, posing challenges for processing long
sequences in VSR. Recently, Mamba has drawn attention for its long-sequence
modeling, linear complexity, and large receptive fields. In this work, we
propose VSRM, a novel \textbf{V}ideo \textbf{S}uper-\textbf{R}esolution
framework that leverages the power of \textbf{M}amba. VSRM introduces
Spatial-to-Temporal Mamba and Temporal-to-Spatial Mamba blocks to extract
long-range spatio-temporal features and enhance receptive fields efficiently.
To better align adjacent frames, we propose Deformable Cross-Mamba Alignment
module. This module utilizes a deformable cross-mamba mechanism to make the
compensation stage more dynamic and flexible, preventing feature distortions.
Finally, we minimize the frequency domain gaps between reconstructed and
ground-truth frames by proposing a simple yet effective Frequency
Charbonnier-like loss that better preserves high-frequency content and enhances
visual quality. Through extensive experiments, VSRM achieves state-of-the-art
results on diverse benchmarks, establishing itself as a solid foundation for

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Deepfake数据集未能真实反映攻击对人类感知的影响，需要更现实的攻击向量。

Method: 引入PF攻击方法，操纵关键语音片段，并开发自适应优先计算的双层检测模型。

Result: PF攻击降低人类感知42%，基准准确率94%；检测模型降低EER 91%，速度提升90%。

Conclusion: PF攻击和检测模型为Deepfake攻击提供了更现实的评估和高效解决方案。

Abstract: Deepfake (DF) attacks pose a growing threat as generative models become
increasingly advanced. However, our study reveals that existing DF datasets
fail to deceive human perception, unlike real DF attacks that influence public
discourse. It highlights the need for more realistic DF attack vectors. We
introduce PhonemeFake (PF), a DF attack that manipulates critical speech
segments using language reasoning, significantly reducing human perception by
up to 42% and benchmark accuracies by up to 94%. We release an easy-to-use PF
dataset on HuggingFace and open-source bilevel DF segment detection model that
adaptively prioritizes compute on manipulated regions. Our extensive
experiments across three known DF datasets reveal that our detection model
reduces EER by 91% while achieving up to 90% speed-up, with minimal compute
overhead and precise localization beyond existing models as a scalable
solution.

*Yu Han,Zhiwei Huang,Yanting Zhang,Fangjun Ding,Shen Cai,Rui Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于无检测器匹配框架的点-像素配准方法，用于解决LiDAR点云与相机图像之间的模态差异问题，尤其在单帧稀疏LiDAR场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR点云与相机图像之间的模态差异和单帧稀疏性导致现有方法难以有效配准，需要多帧累积或额外先验信息。

Method: 通过将LiDAR强度图投影到2D视图，并利用基于注意力的无检测器匹配网络直接估计跨模态对应关系，同时引入可重复性评分机制提升匹配可靠性。

Result: 在KITTI、nuScenes和MIAS-LCEC-TF70基准测试中，该方法实现了最先进的性能，优于依赖多帧累积的现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过无检测器匹配框架和可重复性评分机制，有效解决了单帧稀疏LiDAR下的点-像素配准问题，具有较高的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Point-pixel registration between LiDAR point clouds and camera images is a
fundamental yet challenging task in autonomous driving and robotic perception.
A key difficulty lies in the modality gap between unstructured point clouds and
structured images, especially under sparse single-frame LiDAR settings.
Existing methods typically extract features separately from point clouds and
images, then rely on hand-crafted or learned matching strategies. This separate
encoding fails to bridge the modality gap effectively, and more critically,
these methods struggle with the sparsity and noise of single-frame LiDAR, often
requiring point cloud accumulation or additional priors to improve reliability.
Inspired by recent progress in detector-free matching paradigms (e.g.
MatchAnything), we revisit the projection-based approach and introduce the
detector-free framework for direct point-pixel matching between LiDAR and
camera views. Specifically, we project the LiDAR intensity map into a 2D view
from the LiDAR perspective and feed it into an attention-based detector-free
matching network, enabling cross-modal correspondence estimation without
relying on multi-frame accumulation. To further enhance matching reliability,
we introduce a repeatability scoring mechanism that acts as a soft visibility
prior. This guides the network to suppress unreliable matches in regions with
low intensity variation, improving robustness under sparse input. Extensive
experiments on KITTI, nuScenes, and MIAS-LCEC-TF70 benchmarks demonstrate that
our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior
approaches on nuScenes (even those relying on accumulated point clouds),
despite using only single-frame LiDAR.

*Sicong Du,Jiarun Liu,Qifeng Chen,Hao-Xiang Chen,Tai-Jiang Mu,Sheng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RGE-GS是一种新型扩展重建框架，结合扩散生成与奖励引导的高斯积分，解决了3D高斯泼溅技术中的物理不一致性和训练效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单次驾驶片段常导致道路结构扫描不完整，需要扩展重建以支持传感器模拟器有效回归驾驶行为。

Method: 提出奖励网络优先选择一致生成模式，并设计差异化训练策略调整高斯优化进度。

Result: 在公开数据集上，RGE-GS实现了最先进的重建质量。

Conclusion: RGE-GS通过奖励引导和差异化训练，显著提升了重建性能和稳定性。

Abstract: A single-pass driving clip frequently results in incomplete scanning of the
road structure, making reconstructed scene expanding a critical requirement for
sensor simulators to effectively regress driving actions. Although contemporary
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques achieve remarkable reconstruction
quality, their direct extension through the integration of diffusion priors
often introduces cumulative physical inconsistencies and compromises training
efficiency. To address these limitations, we present RGE-GS, a novel expansive
reconstruction framework that synergizes diffusion-based generation with
reward-guided Gaussian integration. The RGE-GS framework incorporates two key
innovations: First, we propose a reward network that learns to identify and
prioritize consistently generated patterns prior to reconstruction phases,
thereby enabling selective retention of diffusion outputs for spatial
stability. Second, during the reconstruction process, we devise a
differentiated training strategy that automatically adjust Gaussian
optimization progress according to scene converge metrics, which achieving
better convergence than baseline methods. Extensive evaluations of publicly
available datasets demonstrate that RGE-GS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in reconstruction quality. Our source-code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/CN-ADLab/RGE-GS. (Camera-ready version
incorporating reviewer suggestions will be updated soon.)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于概念瓶颈模型（CBM）的方法CBM-HNMU，用于增强人类与神经网络之间的相互理解。通过自动识别和修正有害概念，并将修正后的知识蒸馏回黑盒模型，提升了模型的解释性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型的复杂性和不透明性导致其决策难以理解，现有方法缺乏有效干预或仅停留在样本层面。

Method: 利用CBM作为可解释框架，通过全局梯度贡献识别和修正有害概念，并将修正后的知识蒸馏回黑盒模型。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上测试，最高准确率提升2.64%，平均准确率提升1.03%。

Conclusion: CBM-HNMU有效提升了模型的解释性和性能，为人类与神经网络的相互理解提供了新方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to increasingly complex models with
deeper layers and more parameters, reducing interpretability and making their
decisions harder to understand. While many methods explain black-box reasoning,
most lack effective interventions or only operate at sample-level without
modifying the model itself. To address this, we propose the Concept Bottleneck
Model for Enhancing Human-Neural Network Mutual Understanding (CBM-HNMU).
CBM-HNMU leverages the Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) as an interpretable
framework to approximate black-box reasoning and communicate conceptual
understanding. Detrimental concepts are automatically identified and refined
(removed/replaced) based on global gradient contributions. The modified CBM
then distills corrected knowledge back into the black-box model, enhancing both
interpretability and accuracy. We evaluate CBM-HNMU on various CNN and
transformer-based models across Flower-102, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, FGVC-Aircraft,
and CUB-200, achieving a maximum accuracy improvement of 2.64% and a maximum
increase in average accuracy across 1.03%. Source code is available at:

Motivation: 解决现有方法仅通过微调交叉注意力层无法有效保护多样剩余概念的问题。

Method: 采用非线性ResAGs和注意力锚定损失，结合对抗训练和可学习文本嵌入。

Result: 实验表明CPE在擦除名人、艺术风格和不良内容方面优于现有方法，且对攻击提示具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CPE通过非线性模块和对抗训练实现了目标概念的高效擦除和剩余概念的保护。

Abstract: Remarkable progress in text-to-image diffusion models has brought a major
concern about potentially generating images on inappropriate or trademarked
concepts. Concept erasing has been investigated with the goals of deleting
target concepts in diffusion models while preserving other concepts with
minimal distortion. To achieve these goals, recent concept erasing methods
usually fine-tune the cross-attention layers of diffusion models. In this work,
we first show that merely updating the cross-attention layers in diffusion
models, which is mathematically equivalent to adding \emph{linear} modules to
weights, may not be able to preserve diverse remaining concepts. Then, we
propose a novel framework, dubbed Concept Pinpoint Eraser (CPE), by adding
\emph{nonlinear} Residual Attention Gates (ResAGs) that selectively erase (or
cut) target concepts while safeguarding remaining concepts from broad
distributions by employing an attention anchoring loss to prevent the
forgetting. Moreover, we adversarially train CPE with ResAG and learnable text
embeddings in an iterative manner to maximize erasing performance and enhance
robustness against adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments on the erasure of
celebrities, artistic styles, and explicit contents demonstrated that the
proposed CPE outperforms prior arts by keeping diverse remaining concepts while
deleting the target concepts with robustness against attack prompts. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreqDGT是一种频率自适应的动态图变换器，通过整合频率自适应处理、动态图学习和多尺度时间解缠网络，显著提高了跨被试情绪识别的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决脑电图（EEG）在情绪识别中因个体差异导致的跨被试泛化问题。

Method: 提出FreqDGT框架，包括频率自适应处理（FAP）、自适应动态图学习（ADGL）和多尺度时间解缠网络（MTDN）。

Result: 实验表明FreqDGT显著提高了跨被试情绪识别的准确性。

Conclusion: FreqDGT通过整合频率、空间和时间建模，有效解决了跨被试情绪识别的挑战。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) serves as a reliable and objective signal for
emotion recognition in affective brain-computer interfaces, offering unique
advantages through its high temporal resolution and ability to capture
authentic emotional states that cannot be consciously controlled. However,
cross-subject generalization remains a fundamental challenge due to individual
variability, cognitive traits, and emotional responses. We propose FreqDGT, a
frequency-adaptive dynamic graph transformer that systematically addresses
these limitations through an integrated framework. FreqDGT introduces
frequency-adaptive processing (FAP) to dynamically weight emotion-relevant
frequency bands based on neuroscientific evidence, employs adaptive dynamic
graph learning (ADGL) to learn input-specific brain connectivity patterns, and
implements multi-scale temporal disentanglement network (MTDN) that combines
hierarchical temporal transformers with adversarial feature disentanglement to
capture both temporal dynamics and ensure cross-subject robustness.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FreqDGT significantly improves
cross-subject emotion recognition accuracy, confirming the effectiveness of
integrating frequency-adaptive, spatial-dynamic, and temporal-hierarchical
modeling while ensuring robustness to individual differences. The code is
available at https://github.com/NZWANG/FreqDGT.

Motivation: 传统单区域裁剪方法无法满足多区域裁剪需求，需改进以高效提取多个不重叠区域。

Method: 扩展固定比例裁剪算法，动态调整注意力阈值，线性时间内提取多个不重叠区域。

Result: 方法在保持效率的同时，成功提取多个不重叠的显著区域。

Conclusion: 该方法为多区域裁剪提供了高效解决方案，并展望了未来数据集和基准的潜力。

Abstract: Automatic image cropping aims to extract the most visually salient regions
while preserving essential composition elements. Traditional saliency-aware
cropping methods optimize a single bounding box, making them ineffective for
applications requiring multiple disjoint crops. In this work, we extend the
Fixed Aspect Ratio Cropping algorithm to efficiently extract multiple
non-overlapping crops in linear time. Our approach dynamically adjusts
attention thresholds and removes selected crops from consideration without
recomputing the entire saliency map. We discuss qualitative results and
introduce the potential for future datasets and benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在有限词汇下表现良好，但难以处理多样化的对象类别，且3D数据量限制了开放词汇模型的训练。

Method: MVOV3D利用CLIP编码的精确区域级图像和文本特征，结合3D几何先验优化多视图融合。

Result: MVOV3D在ScanNet200和Matterport160上分别达到14.7%和16.2%的mIoU，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MVOV3D通过优化多视图融合，显著提升了开放词汇3D场景理解的性能。

Abstract: Recent open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding approaches mainly focus on
training 3D networks through contrastive learning with point-text pairs or by
distilling 2D features into 3D models via point-pixel alignment. While these
methods show considerable performance in benchmarks with limited vocabularies,
they struggle to handle diverse object categories as the limited amount of 3D
data upbound training strong open-vocabulary 3d models. We observe that 2D
multi-view fusion methods take precedence in understanding diverse concepts in
3D scenes. However, inherent noises in vision-language models lead multi-view
fusion to sub-optimal performance. To this end, we introduce MVOV3D, a novel
approach aimed at unleashing the potential of 2D multi-view fusion for
open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding. We focus on reducing the inherent
noises without training, thereby preserving the generalizability while
enhancing open-world capabilities. Specifically, MVOV3D improves multi-view 2D
features by leveraging precise region-level image features and text features
encoded by CLIP encoders and incorporates 3D geometric priors to optimize
multi-view fusion. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. Notably, our MVOV3D achieves a new record with
14.7% mIoU on ScanNet200 and 16.2% mIoU on Matterport160 for challenge
open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, outperforming current leading trained 3D
networks by a significant margin.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进测试时间提示调优（TPT）的方法，通过利用大语言模型（LLM）初始化提示并引入正则化损失，显著提升了视觉语言模型（VLM）的校准性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的TPT方法在提升准确率的同时忽视了置信度校准问题，限制了其在关键应用中的适用性。

Method: 1. 使用LLM初始化提示以避免过拟合；2. 提出正则化损失以减少类内距离并增加类间距离。

Result: 在15个数据集上的实验显示，方法（TCA）的平均预期校准误差（ECE）为4.11，显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: TCA方法有效解决了TPT中的校准问题，提升了模型在关键应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLM) have demonstrated impressive performance in
image recognition by leveraging self-supervised training on large datasets.
Their performance can be further improved by adapting to the test sample using
test-time prompt tuning (TPT). Unfortunately, the singular focus of TPT
approaches on improving the accuracy suffers from tunnel vision, and leads to
degradation in confidence calibration. This limits the applicability of TPT in
critical applications.
  We make three contributions in this work. (1) We posit that random or naive
initialization of prompts leads to overfitting on a particular test sample, and
is the main reason for miscalibration of the VLM after TPT. To mitigate the
problem, we propose careful initialization of test time prompt using prior
knowledge about the target label attributes from a large language model (LLM);
(2) To further maintain the quality of prompts during \tpt, we propose a novel
regularization loss to reduce intraclass distance, and increase inter-class
distance between the learnt
  Through extensive experiments on different CLIP architectures and 15
datasets, we show that our approach can effectively improve the calibration
after TPT. We report an average expected calibration error (ECE) of 4.11 with
our method, TCA, compared to 11.7 for vanilla TPT, 6.12 for C-TPT (ICLR'24),
6.78 for DiffTPT (CVPR'23), and 8.43 for PromptAlign (NeurIPS'23). The code is

Motivation: 当前奖励模型在泛化性和避免记忆化方面存在不足，需要复杂的标注流程。强化学习（如GRPO）虽能改善泛化性，但在推理准确性上存在缺陷。

Method: 引入听众增强的GRPO框架，听众模型重新评估推理链并提供置信分数，以校准奖励信号，促使推理模型生成更具说服力的解释。

Conclusion: 听众增强的奖励机制为视觉语言模型与人类偏好的对齐提供了一种可扩展且高效的方法。

Abstract: Training robust and generalizable reward models for human visual preferences
is essential for aligning text-to-image and text-to-video generative models
with human intent. However, current reward models often fail to generalize, and
supervised fine-tuning leads to memorization, demanding complex annotation
pipelines. While reinforcement learning (RL), specifically Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), improves generalization, we uncover a key failure
mode: a significant drop in reasoning accuracy occurs when a model's reasoning
trace contradicts that of an independent, frozen vision-language model
("listener") evaluating the same output. To address this, we introduce a
listener-augmented GRPO framework. Here, the listener re-evaluates the
reasoner's chain-of-thought to provide a dense, calibrated confidence score,
shaping the RL reward signal. This encourages the reasoner not only to answer
correctly, but to produce explanations that are persuasive to an independent
model. Our listener-shaped reward scheme achieves best accuracy on the
ImageReward benchmark (67.4%), significantly improves out-of-distribution (OOD)
performance on a large-scale human preference dataset (1.2M votes, up to +6%
over naive reasoner), and reduces reasoning contradictions compared to strong
GRPO and SFT baselines. These results demonstrate that listener-based rewards
provide a scalable, data-efficient path to aligning vision-language models with
nuanced human preferences. We will release our reasoning model here:

TL;DR: SemFaceEdit是一种基于生成辐射流形的新方法，通过语义场实现面部图像的局部编辑，同时保持其他区域的完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D感知GAN技术虽提供多视角一致性，但缺乏局部编辑能力，因此需要一种高效方法实现精细编辑。

Method: SemFaceEdit通过几何模块和外观模块联合训练，生成语义辐射场和RGB辐射场，利用潜在码解耦几何与外观。

Result: 实验表明，SemFaceEdit在语义场编辑和辐射场解耦方面表现优异。

Conclusion: SemFaceEdit为面部图像的局部编辑提供了高效且精确的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite multiple view consistency offered by 3D-aware GAN techniques, the
resulting images often lack the capacity for localized editing. In response,
generative radiance manifolds emerge as an efficient approach for constrained
point sampling within volumes, effectively reducing computational demands and
enabling the learning of fine details. This work introduces SemFaceEdit, a
novel method that streamlines the appearance and geometric editing process by
generating semantic fields on generative radiance manifolds. Utilizing latent
codes, our method effectively disentangles the geometry and appearance
associated with different facial semantics within the generated image. In
contrast to existing methods that can change the appearance of the entire
radiance field, our method enables the precise editing of particular facial
semantics while preserving the integrity of other regions. Our network
comprises two key modules: the Geometry module, which generates semantic
radiance and occupancy fields, and the Appearance module, which is responsible
for predicting RGB radiance. We jointly train both modules in adversarial
settings to learn semantic-aware geometry and appearance descriptors. The
appearance descriptors are then conditioned on their respective semantic latent
codes by the Appearance Module, facilitating disentanglement and enhanced
control. Our experiments highlight SemFaceEdit's superior performance in
semantic field-based editing, particularly in achieving improved radiance field
disentanglement.

Conclusion: FOCUS方法通过自适应提取细粒度特征，显著提升了行人属性识别的性能和实用性。

Abstract: Pedestrian attribute recognition (PAR) is a fundamental perception task in
intelligent transportation and security. To tackle this fine-grained task, most
existing methods focus on extracting regional features to enrich attribute
information. However, a regional feature is typically used to predict a fixed
set of pre-defined attributes in these methods, which limits the performance
and practicality in two aspects: 1) Regional features may compromise
fine-grained patterns unique to certain attributes in favor of capturing common
characteristics shared across attributes. 2) Regional features cannot
generalize to predict unseen attributes in the test time. In this paper, we
propose the \textbf{F}ine-grained \textbf{O}ptimization with semanti\textbf{C}
g\textbf{U}ided under\textbf{S}tanding (FOCUS) approach for PAR, which
adaptively extracts fine-grained attribute-level features for each attribute
individually, regardless of whether the attributes are seen or not during
training. Specifically, we propose the Multi-Granularity Mix Tokens (MGMT) to
capture latent features at varying levels of visual granularity, thereby
enriching the diversity of the extracted information. Next, we introduce the
Attribute-guided Visual Feature Extraction (AVFE) module, which leverages
textual attributes as queries to retrieve their corresponding visual attribute
features from the Mix Tokens using a cross-attention mechanism. To ensure that
textual attributes focus on the appropriate Mix Tokens, we further incorporate
a Region-Aware Contrastive Learning (RACL) method, encouraging attributes
within the same region to share consistent attention maps. Extensive
experiments on PA100K, PETA, and RAPv1 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
and strong generalization ability of our method.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) across aerial and ground vantage points has
become crucial for large-scale surveillance and public safety applications.
Although significant progress has been made in ground-only scenarios, bridging
the aerial-ground domain gap remains a formidable challenge due to extreme
viewpoint differences, scale variations, and occlusions. Building upon the
achievements of the AG-ReID 2023 Challenge, this paper introduces the AG-VPReID
2025 Challenge - the first large-scale video-based competition focused on

Motivation: 解决网格去噪问题，提高去噪效果和鲁棒性。

Result: 在多种噪声条件下表现优异，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DMD-Net是一种高效、鲁棒的网格去噪方法。

Abstract: We present Deep Mesh Denoising Network (DMD-Net), an end-to-end deep learning
framework, for solving the mesh denoising problem. DMD-Net consists of a Graph
Convolutional Neural Network in which aggregation is performed in both the
primal as well as the dual graph. This is realized in the form of an asymmetric
two-stream network, which contains a primal-dual fusion block that enables
communication between the primal-stream and the dual-stream. We develop a
Feature Guided Transformer (FGT) paradigm, which consists of a feature
extractor, a transformer, and a denoiser. The feature extractor estimates the
local features, that guide the transformer to compute a transformation, which
is applied to the noisy input mesh to obtain a useful intermediate
representation. This is further processed by the denoiser to obtain the
denoised mesh. Our network is trained on a large scale dataset of 3D objects.
We perform exhaustive ablation studies to demonstrate that each component in
our network is essential for obtaining the best performance. We show that our
method obtains competitive or better results when compared with the
state-of-the-art mesh denoising algorithms. We demonstrate that our method is
robust to various kinds of noise. We observe that even in the presence of

*Li-Cheng Shen,Jih-Kang Hsieh,Wei-Hua Li,Chu-Song Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MaTIR任务结合了文本到图像检索（TIR）和参考表达式分割（RES），提出了一种两阶段框架，显著提升了检索和分割效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TIR方法缺乏解释性，而RES在大规模图像集上计算成本高，MaTIR旨在统一两者。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：第一阶段生成分割感知的检索结果，第二阶段用MLLM重排序并生成边界框。利用SAM 2和Alpha-CLIP离线处理。

Result: 在COCO和D$^3$数据集上，检索准确性和分割质量显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MaTIR任务和两阶段框架有效结合了TIR和RES，实现了高效检索和精确分割。

Abstract: Text-to-image retrieval (TIR) aims to find relevant images based on a textual
query, but existing approaches are primarily based on whole-image captions and
lack interpretability. Meanwhile, referring expression segmentation (RES)
enables precise object localization based on natural language descriptions but
is computationally expensive when applied across large image collections. To
bridge this gap, we introduce Mask-aware TIR (MaTIR), a new task that unifies
TIR and RES, requiring both efficient image search and accurate object
segmentation. To address this task, we propose a two-stage framework,
comprising a first stage for segmentation-aware image retrieval and a second
stage for reranking and object grounding with a multimodal large language model
(MLLM). We leverage SAM 2 to generate object masks and Alpha-CLIP to extract
region-level embeddings offline at first, enabling effective and scalable
online retrieval. Secondly, MLLM is used to refine retrieval rankings and
generate bounding boxes, which are matched to segmentation masks. We evaluate
our approach on COCO and D$^3$ datasets, demonstrating significant improvements
in both retrieval accuracy and segmentation quality over previous methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种弱监督语义分割框架，结合区域感知CAM和伪标签训练，解决了缺陷检测中数据标注依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业缺陷检测需要高精度分割，但传统方法依赖大规模标注数据，与实际需求冲突。

Method: 引入过滤引导反向传播（FGBP）优化CAM，结合区域感知加权模块提升空间精度，并通过伪标签迭代优化模型。

Result: 在工业缺陷数据集上验证了方法的优越性，实现了弱监督学习与高精度分割的结合。

Conclusion: 该框架为资源受限的工业场景提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Surface defect detection plays a critical role in industrial quality
inspection. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have significantly
enhanced the automation level of detection processes. However, conventional
semantic segmentation and object detection models heavily rely on large-scale
annotated datasets, which conflicts with the practical requirements of defect
detection tasks. This paper proposes a novel weakly supervised semantic
segmentation framework comprising two key components: a region-aware class
activation map (CAM) and pseudo-label training. To address the limitations of
existing CAM methods, especially low-resolution thermal maps, and insufficient
detail preservation, we introduce filtering-guided backpropagation (FGBP),
which refines target regions by filtering gradient magnitudes to identify areas
with higher relevance to defects. Building upon this, we further develop a
region-aware weighted module to enhance spatial precision. Finally,
pseudo-label segmentation is implemented to refine the model's performance
iteratively. Comprehensive experiments on industrial defect datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our method. The proposed framework effectively
bridges the gap between weakly supervised learning and high-precision defect
segmentation, offering a practical solution for resource-constrained industrial
scenarios.

TL;DR: STR-Match是一种无需训练的视频编辑算法，通过新的STR评分优化潜在空间，解决了现有方法的时间不一致性和运动失真问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本引导的视频编辑方法存在时间不一致、运动失真和领域转换受限的问题，主要原因是时空像素相关性建模不足。

Method: 提出STR-Match算法，利用2D空间注意力和1D时间模块计算STR评分，指导潜在优化，无需3D注意力机制。

Result: 实验表明，STR-Match在视觉质量和时空一致性上优于现有方法，尤其在领域转换中表现优异。

Conclusion: STR-Match通过优化时空像素相关性，显著提升了视频编辑的时空一致性和视觉质量。

Abstract: Previous text-guided video editing methods often suffer from temporal
inconsistency, motion distortion, and-most notably-limited domain
transformation. We attribute these limitations to insufficient modeling of
spatiotemporal pixel relevance during the editing process. To address this, we
propose STR-Match, a training-free video editing algorithm that produces
visually appealing and spatiotemporally coherent videos through latent
optimization guided by our novel STR score. The score captures spatiotemporal
pixel relevance across adjacent frames by leveraging 2D spatial attention and
1D temporal modules in text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models, without the
overhead of computationally expensive 3D attention mechanisms. Integrated into
a latent optimization framework with a latent mask, STR-Match generates
temporally consistent and visually faithful videos, maintaining strong
performance even under significant domain transformations while preserving key
visual attributes of the source. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
STR-Match consistently outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and
spatiotemporal consistency.

Motivation: 现有方法（如Sa2VA）直接融合特征导致动态视觉信息与静态语义纠缠，降低分割精度。

Conclusion: DeSa2VA通过解耦和动态融合显著提升了分割和接地任务的性能。

Abstract: Existing video segmenter and grounder approaches, exemplified by Sa2VA,
directly fuse features within segmentation models. This often results in an
undesirable entanglement of dynamic visual information and static semantics,
thereby degrading segmentation accuracy. To systematically mitigate this issue,
we propose DeSa2VA, a decoupling-enhanced prompting scheme integrating text
pre-training and a linear decoupling module to address the information
processing limitations inherent in SAM-2. Specifically, first, we devise a
pre-training paradigm that converts textual ground-truth labels into
point-level prompts while generating corresponding text masks. These masks are
refined through a hybrid loss function to strengthen the model's semantic
grounding capabilities. Next, we employ linear projection to disentangle hidden
states that generated by a large language model into distinct textual and
visual feature subspaces. Finally, a dynamic mask fusion strategy
synergistically combines these decoupled features through triple supervision
from predicted text/visual masks and ground-truth annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks,
including image segmentation, image question answering, video segmentation, and
video question answering. Our codes are available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于对比学习的语义信息量度量方法，用于评估图像和文本的绝对语义信息量，并重新定义了信息增益的概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管对比学习能够建模多模态概率分布并估计关系语义相似性，但其是否能表示绝对语义信息量尚不明确。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过对比学习模型计算图像和文本的语义信息量，重新定义信息增益概念，并基于嵌入的范数度量信息增益。

Result: 实验结果显示，信息增益得分低的图像通常为占位图标（如“未找到图像”），且信息增益与嵌入范数强相关（R²=0.98-1.00）。

Conclusion: 该方法计算成本低，适用于公开模型，为评估多模态数据的语义信息量提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Contrastive learning has the capacity to model multimodal probability
distributions by embedding and aligning visual representations with semantics
from captions. This approach enables the estimation of relational semantic
similarity; however, it remains unclear whether it can also represent absolute
semantic informativeness. In this work, we introduce a semantic informativeness
metric for an image calculated from text samples via a contrastive learning
model; similarly, the informativeness of a text is calculated from image
samples. We propose a redefinition of the concept of Information Gain, a
concept previously explored in natural language processing, extending its
application to the domains of vision and language. Our metric quantifies how
conditioning on an image distorts the distribution of associated texts, and
vice versa for text conditioning on image distributions. In OpenCLIP's
empirical results, we observe that images with the lowest Information Gain
scores often correspond to placeholder icons such as "image not found."
Furthermore, we propose to measure a norm-based metric of the embedding to
estimate the Information Gain, following the theoretical results for Skip-Gram
with Negative Sampling (SGNS) word embedding. Information Gain can be measured
using either CLIP or SigLIP, and the results demonstrate a strong correlation
with a coefficient of determination ranging from 0.98 to 1.00. After obtaining
the mean and the covariance of the sample embedding, the computational cost of
this method is independent of the sample size, and it is compatible with
publicly available, open-weight models.

Result: 实验证明CP-Guard能有效检测恶意代理并提升系统可靠性。

Conclusion: CP-Guard为协作感知提供了一种统一、自适应的防御解决方案。

Abstract: Collaborative Perception (CP) has been shown to be a promising technique for
multi-agent autonomous driving and multi-agent robotic systems, where multiple
agents share their perception information to enhance the overall perception
performance and expand the perception range. However, in CP, an ego agent needs
to receive messages from its collaborators, which makes it vulnerable to
attacks from malicious agents. To address this critical issue, we propose a
unified, probability-agnostic, and adaptive framework, namely, CP-Guard, which
is a tailored defense mechanism for CP deployed by each agent to accurately
detect and eliminate malicious agents in its collaboration network. Our key
idea is to enable CP to reach a consensus rather than a conflict against an ego
agent's perception results. Based on this idea, we first develop a
probability-agnostic sample consensus (PASAC) method to effectively sample a
subset of the collaborators and verify the consensus without prior
probabilities of malicious agents. Furthermore, we define collaborative
consistency loss (CCLoss) for object detection task and bird's eye view (BEV)
segmentation task to capture the discrepancy between an ego agent and its
collaborators, which is used as a verification criterion for consensus. In
addition, we propose online adaptive threshold via dual sliding windows to
dynamically adjust the threshold for consensus verification and ensure the
reliability of the systems in dynamic environments. Finally, we conduct
extensive experiments and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Code
will be released at https://github.com/CP-Security/CP-Guard

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NCA在低分辨率网格上表现良好，但在高分辨率下因计算和内存需求剧增、信息传播受限而难以扩展。

Method: 通过引入轻量级隐式解码器，在粗网格上运行NCA后渲染任意分辨率图像，并设计了针对高分辨率任务的损失函数。

Result: 该方法显著提升了质量和效率，实现了实时高清输出，同时保持了自组织和涌现特性。

Conclusion: 结合隐式解码器的NCA框架能够高效扩展到高分辨率任务，适用于多种变体和应用场景。

Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs) are bio-inspired systems in which identical
cells self-organize to form complex and coherent patterns by repeatedly
applying simple local rules. NCAs display striking emergent behaviors including
self-regeneration, generalization and robustness to unseen situations, and
spontaneous motion. Despite their success in texture synthesis and
morphogenesis, NCAs remain largely confined to low-resolution grids. This
limitation stems from (1) training time and memory requirements that grow
quadratically with grid size, (2) the strictly local propagation of information
which impedes long-range cell communication, and (3) the heavy compute demands
of real-time inference at high resolution. In this work, we overcome this
limitation by pairing NCA with a tiny, shared implicit decoder, inspired by
recent advances in implicit neural representations. Following NCA evolution on
a coarse grid, a lightweight decoder renders output images at arbitrary
resolution. We also propose novel loss functions for both morphogenesis and
texture synthesis tasks, specifically tailored for high-resolution output with
minimal memory and computation overhead. Combining our proposed architecture
and loss functions brings substantial improvement in quality, efficiency, and
performance. NCAs equipped with our implicit decoder can generate full-HD
outputs in real time while preserving their self-organizing, emergent
properties. Moreover, because each MLP processes cell states independently,
inference remains highly parallelizable and efficient. We demonstrate the
applicability of our approach across multiple NCA variants (on 2D, 3D grids,
and 3D meshes) and multiple tasks, including texture generation and
morphogenesis (growing patterns from a seed), showing that with our proposed
framework, NCAs seamlessly scale to high-resolution outputs with minimal
computational overhead.

Method: MOTOR利用基于文本和视觉信息的检索重排序，结合接地字幕和最优传输技术。

Result: 在MedVQA数据集上，MOTOR平均准确率提升6.45%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MOTOR通过多模态上下文优化检索，显著提升了医学视觉问答的准确性。

Abstract: Medical visual question answering (MedVQA) plays a vital role in clinical
decision-making by providing contextually rich answers to image-based queries.
Although vision-language models (VLMs) are widely used for this task, they
often generate factually incorrect answers. Retrieval-augmented generation
addresses this challenge by providing information from external sources, but
risks retrieving irrelevant context, which can degrade the reasoning
capabilities of VLMs. Re-ranking retrievals, as introduced in existing
approaches, enhances retrieval relevance by focusing on query-text alignment.
However, these approaches neglect the visual or multimodal context, which is
particularly crucial for medical diagnosis. We propose MOTOR, a novel
multimodal retrieval and re-ranking approach that leverages grounded captions
and optimal transport. It captures the underlying relationships between the
query and the retrieved context based on textual and visual information.
Consequently, our approach identifies more clinically relevant contexts to
augment the VLM input. Empirical analysis and human expert evaluation
demonstrate that MOTOR achieves higher accuracy on MedVQA datasets,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.45%. Code is
available at https://github.com/BioMedIA-MBZUAI/MOTOR.

Result: 实验表明，MagShield显著提高了磁干扰下的运动捕捉准确性，并具有良好的兼容性。

Conclusion: MagShield能有效提升稀疏惯性运动捕捉系统在磁干扰环境中的性能。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method called MagShield, designed to address the
issue of magnetic interference in sparse inertial motion capture (MoCap)
systems. Existing Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) systems are prone to
orientation estimation errors in magnetically disturbed environments, limiting
their practical application in real-world scenarios. To address this problem,
MagShield employs a "detect-then-correct" strategy, first detecting magnetic
disturbances through multi-IMU joint analysis, and then correcting orientation
errors using human motion priors. MagShield can be integrated with most
existing sparse inertial MoCap systems, improving their performance in
magnetically disturbed environments. Experimental results demonstrate that
MagShield significantly enhances the accuracy of motion capture under magnetic
interference and exhibits good compatibility across different sparse inertial
MoCap systems.

<details>

Motivation: 视觉提示调优（VPT）中，图像块嵌入与Transformer自注意力模块的交互导致数据分布非高斯化，这给提示学习带来了挑战。

Method: 通过白化数据使其更接近高斯分布，并引入双线性模型（BPT）学习低秩提示矩阵，以减少参数和计算开销。

Result: BPT方法在多个基准数据集上显著提升了准确率（如CUB数据集上提升>25%），同时减少了参数和计算量。

Conclusion: BPT方法通过数据白化和低秩分解，有效解决了VPT中的非高斯分布问题，提升了性能和效率。

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) is a parameter-efficient fune-tuning technique
that adapts a pre-trained vision Transformer (ViT) by learning a small set of
parameters in the input space, known as prompts. In VPT, we uncover
``burstiness'' in the values arising from the interaction of image patch
embeddings, and the key and query projectors within Transformer's
self-attention module. Furthermore, the values of patch embeddings and the key
and query projectors exhibit Laplacian and hyper-Laplacian distribution,
respectively. Intuitively, these non-Gaussian distributions pose challenges for
learning prompts. To address this, we propose whitening these data,
de-correlating them and equalizing their variance towards more Gaussian before
learning prompts. We derive the whitening matrix over random image patch
embeddings and ViT's key and query projectors, and multiply it with the prompt
to be learned in a bilinear manner. Surprisingly, this method significantly
accelerates prompt tuning and boosts accuracy, e.g., $>$25 accuracy points on
the CUB dataset; interestingly, it learns ``bursty prompts''. Extending the
bilinear model which is known to introduce burstiness, we present a compact,
low-rank version by learning two smaller matrices whose multiplication yields
the final prompts. We call the proposed methods Bilinear Prompt Tuning (BPT).
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that BPT
methods not only outperform various VPT methods but also reduce parameter count
and computation overhead.

Abstract: The increasing realism of multimodal content has made misinformation more
subtle and harder to detect, especially in news media where images are
frequently paired with bilingual (e.g., Chinese-English) subtitles. Such

model reasoning with up-to-date external context. We further release BiMiBench,
a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark constructed by systematically editing
real news images and subtitles, comprising 104,000 samples with realistic
manipulations across visual and linguistic modalities. To enhance
interpretability, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve
explanation quality, marking the first use of GRPO in this domain. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BiMi outperforms strong baselines by up to +8.9 in
classification accuracy, +15.9 in localization accuracy, and +2.5 in

generative text, images, videos, and audio may surpass the influence of any
single modality." In response, California's Bill AB 3211 mandates the
watermarking of AI-generated images, videos, and audio. However, concerns
remain regarding the vulnerability of invisible watermarking techniques to
tampering and the potential for malicious actors to bypass them entirely.
Generative AI-powered de-watermarking attacks, especially the newly introduced
visual paraphrase attack, have shown an ability to fully remove watermarks,
resulting in a paraphrase of the original image. This paper introduces PECCAVI,
the first visual paraphrase attack-safe and distortion-free image watermarking
technique. In visual paraphrase attacks, an image is altered while preserving
its core semantic regions, termed Non-Melting Points (NMPs). PECCAVI
strategically embeds watermarks within these NMPs and employs multi-channel
frequency domain watermarking. It also incorporates noisy burnishing to counter
reverse-engineering efforts aimed at locating NMPs to disrupt the embedded
watermark, thereby enhancing durability. PECCAVI is model-agnostic. All
relevant resources and codes will be open-sourced.

### [147] [ActAlign: Zero-Shot Fine-Grained Video Classification via Language-Guided Sequence Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22967)
*Amir Aghdam,Vincent Tao Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ActAlign是一种零样本视频分类框架，通过动态时间规整（DTW）对齐语言模型生成的子动作序列与视频帧，无需视频文本监督或微调，在ActionAtlas基准上表现优于大型视频语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决零样本细粒度视频分类任务，现有对比视觉语言模型无法捕捉时间结构，难以区分细粒度动作。

Method: 使用大型语言模型生成有序子动作序列，通过DTW在共享嵌入空间对齐视频帧。

Result: 在ActionAtlas基准上达到30.5%准确率，优于参数多8倍的视频语言模型。

Conclusion: 结构化语言先验与经典对齐技术结合，为细粒度视频理解提供可扩展的通用方法。

Abstract: We address the task of zero-shot fine-grained video classification, where no
video examples or temporal annotations are available for unseen action classes.
While contrastive vision-language models such as SigLIP demonstrate strong
open-set recognition via mean-pooled image-text similarity, they fail to
capture the temporal structure critical for distinguishing fine-grained
activities. We introduce ActAlign, a zero-shot framework that formulates video
classification as sequence alignment. For each class, a large language model
generates an ordered sub-action sequence, which is aligned with video frames
using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in a shared embedding space. Without any
video-text supervision or fine-tuning, ActAlign achieves 30.5% accuracy on the
extremely challenging ActionAtlas benchmark, where human accuracy is only
61.6%. ActAlign outperforms billion-parameter video-language models while using
approximately 8x less parameters. These results demonstrate that structured
language priors, combined with classical alignment techniques, offer a scalable
and general approach to unlocking the open-set recognition potential of
vision-language models for fine-grained video understanding.

*Jie Liu,Jiayi Shen,Pan Zhou,Jan-Jakob Sonke,Efstratios Gavves*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FewCLIP提出了一种概率原型校准框架，通过多模态原型学习提升广义少样本语义分割的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于原型的方法具有确定性，难以适应多样样本，尤其是标注稀缺的新类别。

Method: FewCLIP引入原型校准机制和分布正则化，优化多模态原型学习。

Result: 在PASCAL-5$^i$和COCO-20$^i$数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FewCLIP通过概率原型校准提升了少样本分割的适应性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Generalized Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation (GFSS) aims to extend a
segmentation model to novel classes with only a few annotated examples while
maintaining performance on base classes. Recently, pretrained vision-language
models (VLMs) such as CLIP have been leveraged in GFSS to improve
generalization on novel classes through multi-modal prototypes learning.
However, existing prototype-based methods are inherently deterministic,
limiting the adaptability of learned prototypes to diverse samples,
particularly for novel classes with scarce annotations. To address this, we
propose FewCLIP, a probabilistic prototype calibration framework over
multi-modal prototypes from the pretrained CLIP, thus providing more adaptive
prototype learning for GFSS. Specifically, FewCLIP first introduces a prototype
calibration mechanism, which refines frozen textual prototypes with learnable
visual calibration prototypes, leading to a more discriminative and adaptive
representation. Furthermore, unlike deterministic prototype learning
techniques, FewCLIP introduces distribution regularization over these
calibration prototypes. This probabilistic formulation ensures structured and
uncertainty-aware prototype learning, effectively mitigating overfitting to
limited novel class data while enhancing generalization. Extensive experimental
results on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets demonstrate that our proposed
FewCLIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across both GFSS
and class-incremental setting. The code is available at

Conclusion: 研究强调了VLMs对抗漏洞的重要性，提供了更鲁棒的对抗样本生成框架，对实际应用安全有重要意义。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have revolutionized computer vision,
enabling tasks such as image classification, captioning, and visual question
answering. However, they remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly in scenarios where both visual and textual modalities can be
manipulated. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive reproducibility study of
"An Image is Worth 1000 Lies: Adversarial Transferability Across Prompts on
Vision-Language Models" validating the Cross-Prompt Attack (CroPA) and
confirming its superior cross-prompt transferability compared to existing
baselines. Beyond replication we propose several key improvements: (1) A novel
initialization strategy that significantly improves Attack Success Rate (ASR).
(2) Investigate cross-image transferability by learning universal
perturbations. (3) A novel loss function targeting vision encoder attention
mechanisms to improve generalization. Our evaluation across prominent VLMs --
including Flamingo, BLIP-2, and InstructBLIP as well as extended experiments on
LLaVA validates the original results and demonstrates that our improvements
consistently boost adversarial effectiveness. Our work reinforces the
importance of studying adversarial vulnerabilities in VLMs and provides a more
robust framework for generating transferable adversarial examples, with
significant implications for understanding the security of VLMs in real-world
applications.

Abstract: VisionScores presents a novel proposal being the first system-segmented image
score dataset, aiming to offer structure-rich, high information-density images
for machine and deep learning tasks. Delimited to two-handed piano pieces, it
was built to consider not only certain graphic similarity but also composition
patterns, as this creative process is highly instrument-dependent. It provides
two scenarios in relation to composer and composition type. The first, formed
by 14k samples, considers works from different authors but the same composition
type, specifically, Sonatinas. The latter, consisting of 10.8K samples,
presents the opposite case, various composition types from the same author,
being the one selected Franz Liszt. All of the 24.8k samples are formatted as
grayscale jpg images of $128 \times 512$ pixels. VisionScores supplies the
users not only the formatted samples but the systems' order and pieces'
metadata. Moreover, unsegmented full-page scores and the pre-formatted images
are included for further analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学数据集的像素级标注成本高且耗时，如何在标注数据稀缺的情况下提升分割性能是一个关键挑战。

Method: AugPaint利用潜在扩散模型进行修复任务，无需重新训练，通过反向去噪过程生成与标签掩码匹配的合成图像。

Result: 在四个公共医学图像分割数据集上的实验表明，AugPaint优于现有方法，显著提升了分割性能。

Conclusion: AugPaint通过高效生成图像-标签对，解决了标注数据稀缺问题，为医学图像分割提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Collecting pixel-level labels for medical datasets can be a laborious and
expensive process, and enhancing segmentation performance with a scarcity of
labeled data is a crucial challenge. This work introduces AugPaint, a data
augmentation framework that utilizes inpainting to generate image-label pairs
from limited labeled data. AugPaint leverages latent diffusion models, known
for their ability to generate high-quality in-domain images with low overhead,
and adapts the sampling process for the inpainting task without need for
retraining. Specifically, given a pair of image and label mask, we crop the
area labeled with the foreground and condition on it during reversed denoising
process for every noise level. Masked background area would gradually be filled
in, and all generated images are paired with the label mask. This approach
ensures the accuracy of match between synthetic images and label masks, setting
it apart from existing dataset generation methods. The generated images serve
as valuable supervision for training downstream segmentation models,
effectively addressing the challenge of limited annotations. We conducted
extensive evaluations of our data augmentation method on four public medical
image segmentation datasets, including CT, MRI, and skin imaging. Results
across all datasets demonstrate that AugPaint outperforms state-of-the-art
label-efficient methodologies, significantly improving segmentation
performance.

Motivation: 解决3D高斯溅射中高斯基元数量增长导致的内存和带宽压力。

Method: 使用可学习的离散小波变换，固定低通滤波器，学习高通滤波器，并通过正交性损失逐步激活高频细节。

Result: AutoOpti3DGS减少了冗余高斯基元，生成更稀疏的场景表示，适用于内存受限硬件。

Conclusion: AutoOpti3DGS在保持视觉质量的同时，显著优化了3D高斯溅射的内存效率。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a powerful approach in novel view
synthesis, delivering rapid training and rendering but at the cost of an
ever-growing set of Gaussian primitives that strains memory and bandwidth. We
introduce AutoOpti3DGS, a training-time framework that automatically restrains
Gaussian proliferation without sacrificing visual fidelity. The key idea is to
feed the input images to a sequence of learnable Forward and Inverse Discrete
Wavelet Transforms, where low-pass filters are kept fixed, high-pass filters
are learnable and initialized to zero, and an auxiliary orthogonality loss
gradually activates fine frequencies. This wavelet-driven, coarse-to-fine
process delays the formation of redundant fine Gaussians, allowing 3DGS to
capture global structure first and refine detail only when necessary. Through
extensive experiments, AutoOpti3DGS requires just a single filter learning-rate
hyper-parameter, integrates seamlessly with existing efficient 3DGS frameworks,
and consistently produces sparser scene representations more compatible with
memory or storage-constrained hardware.

Motivation: 旨在通过统一训练方法提升多模态任务的性能，突破理解、生成和编辑的界限。

Method: 采用扩散式视觉解码器和双向令牌精炼器，基于语言模型进行统一训练。

Result: 在OpenCompass、DPG-Bench等基准测试中表现优异，超越Ristretto-3B等模型。

Conclusion: Ovis-U1为多模态任务提供了高效统一的解决方案，性能显著提升。

Abstract: In this report, we introduce Ovis-U1, a 3-billion-parameter unified model
that integrates multimodal understanding, text-to-image generation, and image
editing capabilities. Building on the foundation of the Ovis series, Ovis-U1
incorporates a diffusion-based visual decoder paired with a bidirectional token
refiner, enabling image generation tasks comparable to leading models like
GPT-4o. Unlike some previous models that use a frozen MLLM for generation
tasks, Ovis-U1 utilizes a new unified training approach starting from a
language model. Compared to training solely on understanding or generation
tasks, unified training yields better performance, demonstrating the
enhancement achieved by integrating these two tasks. Ovis-U1 achieves a score
of 69.6 on the OpenCompass Multi-modal Academic Benchmark, surpassing recent
state-of-the-art models such as Ristretto-3B and SAIL-VL-1.5-2B. In
text-to-image generation, it excels with scores of 83.72 and 0.89 on the
DPG-Bench and GenEval benchmarks, respectively. For image editing, it achieves
4.00 and 6.42 on the ImgEdit-Bench and GEdit-Bench-EN, respectively. As the
initial version of the Ovis unified model series, Ovis-U1 pushes the boundaries
of multimodal understanding, generation, and editing.

TL;DR: 论文提出DyME训练范式，动态选择记忆（SFT）和探索（RLVR）模式，以提升小规模视觉语言模型的思维可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小规模视觉语言模型（SVLMs）因参数容量有限和指令跟随能力弱，难以实现可靠思维。现有训练范式（SFT和RLVR）对模型要求过高，导致伪思维痕迹和优势崩溃。

Method: 提出DyME范式，动态选择记忆（SFT）和探索（RLVR）模式，确保每次优化更新均有助于平衡。

Result: 实验表明DyME能有效平衡记忆与探索，显著提升模型性能。

Conclusion: DyME是提升SVLMs思维可靠性的实用有效方案。

Abstract: Empowering Small-scale Vision-Language Models (SVLMs) with reliable thinking
capabilities remains fundamentally challenging due to their limited parameter
capacity and weak instruction-following abilities. Existing training paradigms,
including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Reward (RLVR), impose substantial demands on the base VLM, exceeding
the capabilities of SVLMs. Consequently, directly applying these paradigms to
SVLMs often suffers from severe pseudo thinking traces and advantage collapse,
ultimately undermining both thinking reliability and task performance. A
natural solution is to combine SFT and RLVR, leveraging their complementarity
to reduce the dependence on model capacity. However, the widely adopted
two-stage training paradigm still performs poorly on SVLMs, as their tendency
toward sub-optimal convergence hinders the trade-off and limits the benefits of
the combination. To address this, we propose DyME, a novel training paradigm
that Dynamically selects between Memorization (via SFT) and Exploration (via
RLVR) modes at each optimization step, ensuring that every update contributes
to the trade-off. Extensive experiments across diverse domains demonstrate that
DyME consistently achieves this balance, and thus delivers substantial
performance improvements. These results establish DyME as a practical and
effective solution for empowering SVLMs with reliable thinking capabilities.

Abstract: Text watermarking schemes have gained considerable attention in recent years,
yet still face critical challenges in achieving simultaneous robustness,
generalizability, and imperceptibility. This paper introduces a new embedding
paradigm,termed CORE, which comprises several consecutively aligned black pixel
segments. Its key innovation lies in its inherent noise resistance during
transmission and broad applicability across languages and fonts. Based on the
CORE, we present a text watermarking framework named CoreMark. Specifically,
CoreMark first dynamically extracts COREs from characters. Then, the characters
with stronger robustness are selected according to the lengths of COREs. By
modifying the thickness of the CORE, the hidden data is embedded into the
selected characters without causing significant visual distortions. Moreover, a
general plug-and-play embedding strength modulator is proposed, which can
adaptively enhance the robustness for small font sizes by adjusting the
embedding strength according to the font size. Experimental evaluation
indicates that CoreMark demonstrates outstanding generalizability across
multiple languages and fonts. Compared to existing methods, CoreMark achieves
significant improvements in resisting screenshot, print-scan, and print camera
attacks, while maintaining satisfactory imperceptibility.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Counterfactually Decoupled Attention Learning
(CDAL) method for open-world model attribution. Existing methods rely on
handcrafted design of region partitioning or feature space, which could be
confounded by the spurious statistical correlations and struggle with novel
attacks in open-world scenarios. To address this, CDAL explicitly models the
causal relationships between the attentional visual traces and source model
attribution, and counterfactually decouples the discriminative model-specific
artifacts from confounding source biases for comparison. In this way, the
resulting causal effect provides a quantification on the quality of learned
attention maps, thus encouraging the network to capture essential generation
patterns that generalize to unseen source models by maximizing the effect.
Extensive experiments on existing open-world model attribution benchmarks show
that with minimal computational overhead, our method consistently improves
state-of-the-art models by large margins, particularly for unseen novel
attacks. Source code: https://github.com/yzheng97/CDAL.

Abstract: Existing deep learning-based cross-view geo-localization methods primarily
focus on improving the accuracy of cross-domain image matching, rather than
enabling models to comprehensively capture contextual information around the
target and minimize the cost of localization errors. To support systematic
research into this Distance-Aware Cross-View Geo-Localization (DACVGL) problem,
we construct Distance-Aware Campus (DA-Campus), the first benchmark that pairs
multi-view imagery with precise distance annotations across three spatial
resolutions. Based on DA-Campus, we formulate DACVGL as a hierarchical
retrieval problem across different domains. Our study further reveals that, due
to the inherent complexity of spatial relationships among buildings, this
problem can only be addressed via a contrastive learning paradigm, rather than
conventional metric learning. To tackle this challenge, we propose Dynamic
Contrastive Learning (DyCL), a novel framework that progressively aligns
feature representations according to hierarchical spatial margins. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DyCL is highly complementary to existing
multi-scale metric learning methods and yields substantial improvements in both
hierarchical retrieval performance and overall cross-view geo-localization
accuracy. Our code and benchmark are publicly available at

Abstract: Automated and accurate segmentation of individual vertebra in 3D CT and MRI
images is essential for various clinical applications. Due to the limitations
of current imaging techniques and the complexity of spinal structures, existing
methods still struggle with reducing the impact of image blurring and
distinguishing similar vertebrae. To alleviate these issues, we introduce a
Frequency-enhanced Multi-granularity Context Network (FMC-Net) to improve the
accuracy of vertebrae segmentation. Specifically, we first apply wavelet
transform for lossless downsampling to reduce the feature distortion in blurred
images. The decomposed high and low-frequency components are then processed
separately. For the high-frequency components, we apply a High-frequency
Feature Refinement (HFR) to amplify the prominence of key features and filter
out noises, restoring fine-grained details in blurred images. For the
low-frequency components, we use a Multi-granularity State Space Model (MG-SSM)
to aggregate feature representations with different receptive fields,
extracting spatially-varying contexts while capturing long-range dependencies
with linear complexity. The utilization of multi-granularity contexts is
essential for distinguishing similar vertebrae and improving segmentation
accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches on both CT and MRI vertebrae segmentation datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅通过生成空间热图预测驾驶员注视点，未能捕捉注意力分配背后的认知动机，限制了注意力机制的深入理解。

Method: 提出W3DA数据集（包含详细语义和因果标注）和LLada框架（结合像素建模、语义解析和认知推理的端到端架构）。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解驾驶员注意力机制迈出关键一步，对自动驾驶、智能驾驶培训和HCI有重要意义。

Abstract: Modeling task-driven attention in driving is a fundamental challenge for both
autonomous vehicles and cognitive science. Existing methods primarily predict
where drivers look by generating spatial heatmaps, but fail to capture the
cognitive motivations behind attention allocation in specific contexts, which
limits deeper understanding of attention mechanisms. To bridge this gap, we
introduce Explainable Driver Attention Prediction, a novel task paradigm that
jointly predicts spatial attention regions (where), parses attended semantics
(what), and provides cognitive reasoning for attention allocation (why). To
support this, we present W3DA, the first large-scale explainable driver
attention dataset. It enriches existing benchmarks with detailed semantic and
causal annotations across diverse driving scenarios, including normal
conditions, safety-critical situations, and traffic accidents. We further
propose LLada, a Large Language model-driven framework for driver attention
prediction, which unifies pixel modeling, semantic parsing, and cognitive
reasoning within an end-to-end architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of LLada, exhibiting robust generalization across datasets
and driving conditions. This work serves as a key step toward a deeper
understanding of driver attention mechanisms, with significant implications for
autonomous driving, intelligent driver training, and human-computer
interaction.

*Jihun Kim,Hoyong Kwon,Hyeokjun Kweon,Wooseong Jeong,Kuk-Jin Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DC-TTA是一种新颖的测试时适应框架，通过将用户交互划分为更一致的子集并独立处理，显著提升了SAM在复杂场景中的分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM在专业领域或复杂场景（如伪装或多部分对象）中表现不佳，需要一种方法利用用户交互作为监督来适应这些场景。

Method: DC-TTA将用户点击划分为更一致的子集，每个子集通过独立的TTA模型处理，减少冲突并实现局部更新，最后合并模型形成统一预测器。

Result: DC-TTA在多个基准测试中显著优于SAM的零样本结果和传统TTA方法，减少了交互次数并提高了准确性。

Conclusion: DC-TTA通过分而治之策略有效解决了SAM在复杂场景中的局限性，为交互式分割提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Interactive segmentation (IS) allows users to iteratively refine object
boundaries with minimal cues, such as positive and negative clicks. While the
Segment Anything Model (SAM) has garnered attention in the IS community for its
promptable segmentation capabilities, it often struggles in specialized domains
or when handling complex scenarios (e.g., camouflaged or multi-part objects).
To overcome these challenges, we propose DC-TTA, a novel test-time adaptation
(TTA) framework that adapts SAM on a per-sample basis by leveraging user
interactions as supervision. Instead of forcing a single model to incorporate
all user clicks at once, DC-TTA partitions the clicks into more coherent
subsets, each processed independently via TTA with a separated model. This
Divide-and-Conquer strategy reduces conflicts among diverse cues and enables
more localized updates. Finally, we merge the adapted models to form a unified
predictor that integrates the specialized knowledge from each subset.
Experimental results across various benchmarks demonstrate that DC-TTA
significantly outperforms SAM's zero-shot results and conventional TTA methods,
effectively handling complex tasks such as camouflaged object segmentation with
fewer interactions and improved accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多笔画字符的复杂性对非母语学习者构成挑战，简化字符可降低学习障碍并优化字体设计。

Method: 使用高精度字符识别模型评估可读性，选择性去除对可读性影响最小的笔画。

Result: 实验表明，即使去除多个笔画，许多字符仍可区分，支持更正式的简化策略。

Conclusion: 研究为多笔画字符的简化提供了可行框架，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Multi-stroke characters in scripts such as Chinese and Japanese can be highly
complex, posing significant challenges for both native speakers and,
especially, non-native learners. If these characters can be simplified without
degrading their legibility, it could reduce learning barriers for non-native
speakers, facilitate simpler and legible font designs, and contribute to
efficient character-based communication systems. In this paper, we propose a
framework to systematically simplify multi-stroke characters by selectively
removing strokes while preserving their overall legibility. More specifically,
we use a highly accurate character recognition model to assess legibility and
remove those strokes that minimally impact it. Experimental results on 1,256
character classes with 5, 10, 15, and 20 strokes reveal several key findings,
including the observation that even after removing multiple strokes, many
characters remain distinguishable. These findings suggest the potential for
more formalized simplification strategies.

TL;DR: MoCa框架通过两阶段方法改进多模态嵌入模型，解决现有方法的局限性，并在多个基准测试中取得最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态嵌入模型存在三个主要问题：因果注意力不适用于嵌入任务、依赖高质量标注数据导致可扩展性差、训练目标和数据多样性不足。

Method: MoCa分为两阶段：1) 模态感知持续预训练，通过联合重建目标增强双向上下文推理；2) 异构对比微调，利用多样化多模态数据提升泛化能力。

Result: MoCa在MMEB和ViDoRe-v2基准测试中表现优异，达到新最优水平，并展示出良好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: MoCa通过改进注意力机制、数据多样性和训练目标，有效提升了多模态嵌入模型的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal embedding models, built upon causal Vision Language Models (VLMs),
have shown promise in various tasks. However, current approaches face three key
limitations: the use of causal attention in VLM backbones is suboptimal for
embedding tasks; scalability issues due to reliance on high-quality labeled
paired data for contrastive learning; and limited diversity in training
objectives and data. To address these issues, we propose MoCa, a two-stage
framework for transforming pre-trained VLMs into effective bidirectional
multimodal embedding models. The first stage, Modality-aware Continual
Pre-training, introduces a joint reconstruction objective that simultaneously
denoises interleaved text and image inputs, enhancing bidirectional
context-aware reasoning. The second stage, Heterogeneous Contrastive
Fine-tuning, leverages diverse, semantically rich multimodal data beyond simple
image-caption pairs to enhance generalization and alignment. Our method
addresses the stated limitations by introducing bidirectional attention through
continual pre-training, scaling effectively with massive unlabeled datasets via
joint reconstruction objectives, and utilizing diverse multimodal data for
enhanced representation robustness. Experiments demonstrate that MoCa
consistently improves performance across MMEB and ViDoRe-v2 benchmarks,
achieving new state-of-the-art results, and exhibits strong scalability with
both model size and training data on MMEB.

Motivation: 颈动脉斑块分级（CPG）对心血管和脑血管疾病风险评估至关重要，但现有深度学习方法多关注多视图特征融合，忽略了表示学习和类别特征的差异。

Method: 提出CVC-RF框架，包含语料库、视图和类别三个级别的处理，采用中心记忆对比损失、级联下采样注意力模块和无参数专家混合加权策略。

Result: 实验表明CVC-RF在多级细化建模全局特征方面表现优异，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CVC-RF通过多级细化有效提升了CPG任务的性能，为临床实践提供了新工具。

Abstract: Accurate carotid plaque grading (CPG) is vital to assess the risk of
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Due to the small size and high
intra-class variability of plaque, CPG is commonly evaluated using a
combination of transverse and longitudinal ultrasound views in clinical
practice. However, most existing deep learning-based multi-view classification
methods focus on feature fusion across different views, neglecting the
importance of representation learning and the difference in class features. To
address these issues, we propose a novel Corpus-View-Category Refinement
Framework (CVC-RF) that processes information from Corpus-, View-, and
Category-levels, enhancing model performance. Our contribution is four-fold.
First, to the best of our knowledge, we are the foremost deep learning-based
method for CPG according to the latest Carotid Plaque-RADS guidelines. Second,
we propose a novel center-memory contrastive loss, which enhances the network's
global modeling capability by comparing with representative cluster centers and
diverse negative samples at the Corpus level. Third, we design a cascaded
down-sampling attention module to fuse multi-scale information and achieve
implicit feature interaction at the View level. Finally, a parameter-free
mixture-of-experts weighting strategy is introduced to leverage class
clustering knowledge to weight different experts, enabling feature decoupling
at the Category level. Experimental results indicate that CVC-RF effectively
models global features via multi-level refinement, achieving state-of-the-art
performance in the challenging CPG task.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多模态大语言模型UrbanLLaVA，用于统一处理城市研究中的多模态数据，并在多样化任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前城市研究方法通常针对特定数据类型，缺乏统一框架；多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的成功为解决这一问题提供了机会。

Method: 构建多样化的城市指令数据集，提出多阶段训练框架，分离空间推理增强与领域知识学习，并扩展城市研究基准。

Result: 实验表明UrbanLLaVA在单模态和跨模态任务中优于开源和专有MLLMs，并具有跨城市的泛化能力。

Conclusion: UrbanLLaVA为城市研究提供了一个高效的多模态处理框架，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Urban research involves a wide range of scenarios and tasks that require the
understanding of multi-modal data. Current methods often focus on specific data
types and lack a unified framework in urban field for processing them
comprehensively. The recent success of multi-modal large language models
(MLLMs) presents a promising opportunity to overcome this limitation. In this
paper, we introduce $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$, a multi-modal large language model
designed to process these four types of data simultaneously and achieve strong
performance across diverse urban tasks compared with general MLLMs. In
$\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$, we first curate a diverse urban instruction dataset
encompassing both single-modal and cross-modal urban data, spanning from
location view to global view of urban environment. Additionally, we propose a
multi-stage training framework that decouples spatial reasoning enhancement
from domain knowledge learning, thereby improving the compatibility and
downstream performance of $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$ across diverse urban tasks.
Finally, we also extend existing benchmark for urban research to assess the
performance of MLLMs across a wide range of urban tasks. Experimental results
from three cities demonstrate that $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$ outperforms
open-source and proprietary MLLMs in both single-modal tasks and complex
cross-modal tasks and shows robust generalization abilities across cities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多模态（文本、音频、视觉）的行为感知视频摘要框架，通过提取多模态特征生成时间对齐的摘要，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频内容在多个领域的快速增长需要超越传统单模态方法的有效摘要技术。

Method: 整合文本、音频和视觉线索，提取韵律特征、文本提示和视觉指标，识别语义和情感重要时刻，并使用跨模态强调的“奖励词”提升摘要质量。

Result: 在文本和视频评估指标上均显著优于传统方法，如ROUGE-1从0.4769提升至0.7929，BERTScore从0.9152提升至0.9536，视频F1-Score提升近23%。

Conclusion: 多模态整合在生成全面且行为感知的视频摘要方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: The increasing volume of video content in educational, professional, and
social domains necessitates effective summarization techniques that go beyond
traditional unimodal approaches. This paper proposes a behaviour-aware
multimodal video summarization framework that integrates textual, audio, and
visual cues to generate timestamp-aligned summaries. By extracting prosodic
features, textual cues and visual indicators, the framework identifies
semantically and emotionally important moments. A key contribution is the
identification of bonus words, which are terms emphasized across multiple
modalities and used to improve the semantic relevance and expressive clarity of
the summaries. The approach is evaluated against pseudo-ground truth (pGT)
summaries generated using LLM-based extractive method. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements over traditional extractive method, such
as the Edmundson method, in both text and video-based evaluation metrics.
Text-based metrics show ROUGE-1 increasing from 0.4769 to 0.7929 and BERTScore
from 0.9152 to 0.9536, while in video-based evaluation, our proposed framework
improves F1-Score by almost 23%. The findings underscore the potential of
multimodal integration in producing comprehensive and behaviourally informed
video summaries.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理需要精确空间推理的复杂指令时存在挑战，尽管3D点云数据提供了详细的空间线索。

Method: R²S框架模拟人类认知过程，将空间推理分为两个阶段：先识别相关元素，再根据视觉先验处理指令。

Result: 实验表明R²S和3D ReasonSeg显著提升了3D点云的空间推理能力。

Conclusion: R²S和3D ReasonSeg为未来研究提供了新的基准和数据集。

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud perception have demonstrated remarkable
progress in scene understanding through vision-language alignment leveraging
large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods may still encounter
challenges in handling complex instructions that require accurate spatial
reasoning, even if the 3D point cloud data provides detailed spatial cues such
as size and position for identifying the targets. To tackle this issue, we
propose Relevant Reasoning Segmentation (R$^2$S), a reasoning-based
segmentation framework. The framework emulates human cognitive processes by
decomposing spatial reasoning into two sequential stages: first identifying
relevant elements, then processing instructions guided by their associated
visual priors. Furthermore, acknowledging the inadequacy of existing datasets
in complex reasoning tasks, we introduce 3D ReasonSeg, a reasoning-based
segmentation dataset comprising 25,185 training samples and 3,966 validation
samples with precise annotations. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that the R$^2$S and 3D ReasonSeg effectively endow 3D point cloud
perception with stronger spatial reasoning capabilities, and we hope that they
can serve as a new baseline and benchmark for future work.

Abstract: We introduce Ella, an embodied social agent capable of lifelong learning
within a community in a 3D open world, where agents accumulate experiences and
acquire knowledge through everyday visual observations and social interactions.
At the core of Ella's capabilities is a structured, long-term multimodal memory
system that stores, updates, and retrieves information effectively. It consists
of a name-centric semantic memory for organizing acquired knowledge and a
spatiotemporal episodic memory for capturing multimodal experiences. By
integrating this lifelong memory system with foundation models, Ella retrieves
relevant information for decision-making, plans daily activities, builds social
relationships, and evolves autonomously while coexisting with other intelligent
beings in the open world. We conduct capability-oriented evaluations in a
dynamic 3D open world where 15 agents engage in social activities for days and
are assessed with a suite of unseen controlled evaluations. Experimental
results show that Ella can influence, lead, and cooperate with other agents
well to achieve goals, showcasing its ability to learn effectively through
observation and social interaction. Our findings highlight the transformative
potential of combining structured memory systems with foundation models for
advancing embodied intelligence. More videos can be found at

Abstract: Art plagiarism detection plays a crucial role in protecting artists'
copyrights and intellectual property, yet it remains a challenging problem in
forensic analysis. In this paper, we address the task of recognizing
plagiarized paintings and explaining the detected plagarisms by retrieving
visually similar authentic artworks. To support this study, we construct a
dataset by collecting painting photos and synthesizing plagiarized versions
using generative AI, tailored to specific artists' styles. We first establish a
baseline approach using off-the-shelf features from the visual foundation model
DINOv2 to retrieve the most similar images in the database and classify
plagiarism based on a similarity threshold. Surprisingly, this non-learned
method achieves a high recognition accuracy of 97.2\% but suffers from low
retrieval precision 29.0\% average precision (AP). To improve retrieval
quality, we finetune DINOv2 with a metric learning loss using positive and
negative sample pairs sampled in the database. The finetuned model greatly
improves retrieval performance by 12\% AP over the baseline, though it
unexpectedly results in a lower recognition accuracy (92.7\%). We conclude with
insightful discussions and outline directions for future research.

Motivation: 尽管多模态模型在统一理解和生成方面取得了进展，但运动-语言统一模型的发展仍不足。需要解决运动模态与离散表示的重建差距以及统一训练中语言智能的退化问题。

Method: 采用专家混合方法，MotionGPT3将运动作为第二模态，通过分离模型参数解耦运动建模，并保留预训练语言模型的结构和参数。运动分支通过共享注意力机制集成，使用变分自编码器（VAE）编码运动，并通过扩散头预测运动潜在表示。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在运动理解和生成任务中表现优异，同时保留了强大的语言能力。

Conclusion: MotionGPT3在自回归框架内建立了一个统一的运动-语言双模态扩散模型。

Abstract: Though recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated strong
capabilities and opportunities in unified understanding and generation, the
development of unified motion-language models remains underexplored. To enable
such models with high-fidelity human motion, two core challenges must be
addressed. The first is the reconstruction gap between the continuous motion
modality and discrete representation in an autoregressive manner, and the
second is the degradation of language intelligence during unified training.
Inspired by the mixture of experts, we propose MotionGPT3, a bimodal
motion-language model that treats human motion as a second modality, decoupling
motion modeling via separate model parameters and enabling both effective
cross-modal interaction and efficient multimodal scaling training. To preserve
language intelligence, the text branch retains the original structure and
parameters of the pretrained language model, while a new motion branch is
integrated via a shared attention mechanism, enabling bidirectional information
flow between two modalities. We first employ a motion Variational Autoencoder
(VAE) to encode raw human motion into latent representations. Based on this
continuous latent space, the motion branch predicts motion latents directly
from intermediate hidden states using a diffusion head, bypassing discrete
tokenization. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves competitive
performance on both motion understanding and generation tasks while preserving
strong language capabilities, establishing a unified bimodal motion diffusion
framework within an autoregressive manner.

Abstract: World models have become indispensable tools for embodied intelligence,
serving as powerful simulators capable of generating realistic robotic videos
while addressing critical data scarcity challenges. However, current embodied
world models exhibit limited physical awareness, particularly in modeling 3D
geometry and motion dynamics, resulting in unrealistic video generation for
contact-rich robotic scenarios. In this paper, we present RoboScape, a unified
physics-informed world model that jointly learns RGB video generation and
physics knowledge within an integrated framework. We introduce two key
physics-informed joint training tasks: temporal depth prediction that enhances
3D geometric consistency in video rendering, and keypoint dynamics learning
that implicitly encodes physical properties (e.g., object shape and material
characteristics) while improving complex motion modeling. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that RoboScape generates videos with superior visual fidelity and
physical plausibility across diverse robotic scenarios. We further validate its
practical utility through downstream applications including robotic policy
training with generated data and policy evaluation. Our work provides new
insights for building efficient physics-informed world models to advance

Result: 实验证明VisualPrompter在文本-图像对齐评估中达到新SOTA，且具有即插即用设计。

Conclusion: VisualPrompter有效提升生成图像的语义对齐和视觉质量，适配多种生成模型。

Abstract: Since there exists a notable gap between user-provided and model-preferred
prompts, generating high-quality and satisfactory images using diffusion models
often requires prompt engineering to optimize user inputs. Current studies on
text-to-image prompt engineering can effectively enhance the style and
aesthetics of generated images. However, they often neglect the semantic
alignment between generated images and user descriptions, resulting in visually
appealing but content-wise unsatisfying outputs. In this work, we propose
VisualPrompter, a novel training-free prompt engineering framework that refines
user inputs to model-preferred sentences. In particular, VisualPrompter
utilizes an automatic self-reflection module to identify the missing concepts
in generated images and a target-specific prompt optimization mechanism to
revise the prompts in a fine-grained manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our VisualPrompter, which achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on multiple benchmarks for text-image alignment evaluation.
Additionally, our framework features a plug-and-play design, making it highly
adaptable to various generative models.

Motivation: 传统方法中，多视图生成模型生成的中间图像缺乏跨视图一致性（CVC），严重影响3D重建性能。现有方法通过反馈重建结果改进CVC，但受限于噪声和不稳定的输出。

Method: AlignCVC通过软硬对齐策略，将生成和重建的多视图分布与真实多视图分布对齐，分别优化生成和重建模型的目标。

Result: 实验表明，AlignCVC显著提升了CVC，并将推理速度加速至仅需4步。

Conclusion: AlignCVC作为一种即插即用的方法，有效整合多视图生成与3D重建模型，为单图像到3D生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Single-image-to-3D models typically follow a sequential generation and
reconstruction workflow. However, intermediate multi-view images synthesized by
pre-trained generation models often lack cross-view consistency (CVC),
significantly degrading 3D reconstruction performance. While recent methods
attempt to refine CVC by feeding reconstruction results back into the
multi-view generator, these approaches struggle with noisy and unstable
reconstruction outputs that limit effective CVC improvement. We introduce
AlignCVC, a novel framework that fundamentally re-frames single-image-to-3D
generation through distribution alignment rather than relying on strict
regression losses. Our key insight is to align both generated and reconstructed
multi-view distributions toward the ground-truth multi-view distribution,
establishing a principled foundation for improved CVC. Observing that generated
images exhibit weak CVC while reconstructed images display strong CVC due to
explicit rendering, we propose a soft-hard alignment strategy with distinct
objectives for generation and reconstruction models. This approach not only
enhances generation quality but also dramatically accelerates inference to as
few as 4 steps. As a plug-and-play paradigm, our method, namely AlignCVC,
seamlessly integrates various multi-view generation models with 3D
reconstruction models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of AlignCVC for single-image-to-3D generation.

Motivation: 解决高分辨率光流估计中GPU内存消耗过高的问题。

Method: 结合减少的相关体积和高分辨率训练协议，优化RAFT类架构设计。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现最佳，内存消耗显著降低。

Conclusion: MEMFOF在高分辨率光流估计中实现了高效与精度的平衡。

Abstract: Recent advances in optical flow estimation have prioritized accuracy at the
cost of growing GPU memory consumption, particularly for high-resolution
(FullHD) inputs. We introduce MEMFOF, a memory-efficient multi-frame optical
flow method that identifies a favorable trade-off between multi-frame
estimation and GPU memory usage. Notably, MEMFOF requires only 2.09 GB of GPU
memory at runtime for 1080p inputs, and 28.5 GB during training, which uniquely
positions our method to be trained at native 1080p without the need for
cropping or downsampling. We systematically revisit design choices from
RAFT-like architectures, integrating reduced correlation volumes and
high-resolution training protocols alongside multi-frame estimation, to achieve
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks while substantially
reducing memory overhead. Our method outperforms more resource-intensive
alternatives in both accuracy and runtime efficiency, validating its robustness
for flow estimation at high resolutions. At the time of submission, our method
ranks first on the Spring benchmark with a 1-pixel (1px) outlier rate of 3.289,
leads Sintel (clean) with an endpoint error (EPE) of 0.963, and achieves the
best Fl-all error on KITTI-2015 at 2.94%. The code is available at

Abstract: Novel view synthesis for dynamic $3$D scenes poses a significant challenge.
Many notable efforts use NeRF-based approaches to address this task and yield
impressive results. However, these methods rely heavily on sufficient motion
parallax in the input images or videos. When the camera motion range becomes
limited or even stationary (i.e., small camera motion), existing methods
encounter two primary challenges: incorrect representation of scene geometry
and inaccurate estimation of camera parameters. These challenges make prior
methods struggle to produce satisfactory results or even become invalid. To
address the first challenge, we propose a novel Distribution-based Depth
Regularization (DDR) that ensures the rendering weight distribution to align
with the true distribution. Specifically, unlike previous methods that use
depth loss to calculate the error of the expectation, we calculate the
expectation of the error by using Gumbel-softmax to differentiably sample
points from discrete rendering weight distribution. Additionally, we introduce
constraints that enforce the volume density of spatial points before the object
boundary along the ray to be near zero, ensuring that our model learns the
correct geometry of the scene. To demystify the DDR, we further propose a
visualization tool that enables observing the scene geometry representation at
the rendering weight level. For the second challenge, we incorporate camera
parameter learning during training to enhance the robustness of our model to
camera parameters. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in representing scenes with small camera motion
input, and our results compare favorably to state-of-the-art methods.

Method: 提出块级增强模块提取多标签图像中的潜在正视图对，并设计图像感知对比损失以建立视图间的语义一致性。

Result: 在少量多标签图像上，方法在微调和迁移学习中表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法在样本质量和数量受限的情况下，仍能实现高效的表示学习。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has demonstrated its effectiveness in learning
representations through comparison methods that align with human intuition.
However, mainstream SSL methods heavily rely on high body datasets with single
label, such as ImageNet, resulting in intolerable pre-training overhead.
Besides, more general multi-label images are frequently overlooked in SSL,
despite their potential for richer semantic information and broader
applicability in downstream scenarios. Therefore, we tailor the mainstream SSL
approach to guarantee excellent representation learning capabilities using
fewer multi-label images. Firstly, we propose a block-wise augmentation module
aimed at extracting additional potential positive view pairs from multi-label
images. Subsequently, an image-aware contrastive loss is devised to establish
connections between these views, thereby facilitating the extraction of
semantically consistent representations. Comprehensive linear fine-tuning and
transfer learning validate the competitiveness of our approach despite
challenging sample quality and quantity.

Conclusion: 时空解耦的高斯溅射框架有效解决了高动态场景重建中背景与动态对象的时空特征不匹配问题。

Abstract: High-dynamic scene reconstruction aims to represent static background with
rigid spatial features and dynamic objects with deformed continuous
spatiotemporal features. Typically, existing methods adopt unified
representation model (e.g., Gaussian) to directly match the spatiotemporal
features of dynamic scene from frame camera. However, this unified paradigm
fails in the potential discontinuous temporal features of objects due to frame
imaging and the heterogeneous spatial features between background and objects.
To address this issue, we disentangle the spatiotemporal features into various
latent representations to alleviate the spatiotemporal mismatching between
background and objects. In this work, we introduce event camera to compensate
for frame camera, and propose a spatiotemporal-disentangled Gaussian splatting
framework for high-dynamic scene reconstruction. As for dynamic scene, we
figure out that background and objects have appearance discrepancy in
frame-based spatial features and motion discrepancy in event-based temporal
features, which motivates us to distinguish the spatiotemporal features between
background and objects via clustering. As for dynamic object, we discover that
Gaussian representations and event data share the consistent spatiotemporal
characteristic, which could serve as a prior to guide the spatiotemporal
disentanglement of object Gaussians. Within Gaussian splatting framework, the
cumulative scene-object disentanglement can improve the spatiotemporal
discrimination between background and objects to render the time-continuous
dynamic scene. Extensive experiments have been performed to verify the
superiority of the proposed method.

Conclusion: Trident框架通过三元组学习和对抗训练，显著提高了人脸伪造检测的适应性和泛化能力，为数字媒体完整性提供了有力支持。

Abstract: As face forgeries generated by deep neural networks become increasingly
sophisticated, detecting face manipulations in digital media has posed a
significant challenge, underscoring the importance of maintaining digital media
integrity and combating visual disinformation. Current detection models,
predominantly based on supervised training with domain-specific data, often
falter against forgeries generated by unencountered techniques. In response to
this challenge, we introduce \textit{Trident}, a face forgery detection
framework that employs triplet learning with a Siamese network architecture for
enhanced adaptability across diverse forgery methods. \textit{Trident} is
trained on curated triplets to isolate nuanced differences of forgeries,
capturing fine-grained features that distinguish pristine samples from
manipulated ones while controlling for other variables. To further enhance
generalizability, we incorporate domain-adversarial training with a forgery
discriminator. This adversarial component guides our embedding model towards
forgery-agnostic representations, improving its robustness to unseen
manipulations. In addition, we prevent gradient flow from the classifier head
to the embedding model, avoiding overfitting induced by artifacts peculiar to
certain forgeries. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks and
ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. We will
release our code in a GitHub repository.

Result: 在CUHK-SYSU和PRW数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: HAMW方法有效提升了人物搜索任务的性能，同时降低了计算成本。

Abstract: The person search task aims to locate a target person within a set of scene
images. In recent years, transformer-based models in this field have made some
progress. However, they still face three primary challenges: 1) the
self-attention mechanism tends to suppress high-frequency components in the
features, which severely impacts model performance; 2) the computational cost
of transformers is relatively high. To address these issues, we propose a novel
High-frequency Augmentation and Multi-Wave mixing (HAMW) method for person
search. HAMW is designed to enhance the discriminative feature extraction
capabilities of transformers while reducing computational overhead and
improving efficiency. Specifically, we develop a three-stage framework that
progressively optimizes both detection and re-identification performance. Our
model enhances the perception of high-frequency features by learning from
augmented inputs containing additional high-frequency components. Furthermore,
we replace the self-attention layers in the transformer with a strategy based
on multi-level Haar wavelet fusion to capture multi-scale features. This not
only lowers the computational complexity but also alleviates the suppression of
high-frequency features and enhances the ability to exploit multi-scale
information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HAMW achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both the CUHK-SYSU and PRW datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的3D形状补全方法未能显式建模最优全局传输路径，且受限于体素空间的分辨率约束，导致补全效果不佳。

Method: BridgeShape将形状补全建模为最优传输问题，并引入深度增强的VQ-VAE编码3D形状到紧凑潜在空间，结合多视角深度信息和DINOv2特征增强几何感知。

Result: BridgeShape在大规模3D形状补全基准测试中达到最优性能，支持更高分辨率和未见过的物体类别。

Conclusion: BridgeShape通过潜在扩散和最优传输路径显式建模，显著提升了3D形状补全的全局一致性和细节生成能力。

Abstract: Existing diffusion-based 3D shape completion methods typically use a
conditional paradigm, injecting incomplete shape information into the denoising
network via deep feature interactions (e.g., concatenation, cross-attention) to
guide sampling toward complete shapes, often represented by voxel-based
distance functions. However, these approaches fail to explicitly model the
optimal global transport path, leading to suboptimal completions. Moreover,
performing diffusion directly in voxel space imposes resolution constraints,
limiting the generation of fine-grained geometric details. To address these
challenges, we propose BridgeShape, a novel framework for 3D shape completion
via latent diffusion Schr\"odinger bridge. The key innovations lie in two
aspects: (i) BridgeShape formulates shape completion as an optimal transport
problem, explicitly modeling the transition between incomplete and complete
shapes to ensure a globally coherent transformation. (ii) We introduce a
Depth-Enhanced Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode 3D
shapes into a compact latent space, leveraging self-projected multi-view depth
information enriched with strong DINOv2 features to enhance geometric
structural perception. By operating in a compact yet structurally informative
latent space, BridgeShape effectively mitigates resolution constraints and
enables more efficient and high-fidelity 3D shape completion. BridgeShape
achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale 3D shape completion
benchmarks, demonstrating superior fidelity at higher resolutions and for
unseen object classes.

Conclusion: TVG-SLAM通过几何约束和动态机制显著提升了RGB-only SLAM的鲁棒性和渲染质量，适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled RGB-only SLAM
systems to achieve high-fidelity scene representation. However, the heavy
reliance of existing systems on photometric rendering loss for camera tracking
undermines their robustness, especially in unbounded outdoor environments with
severe viewpoint and illumination changes. To address these challenges, we
propose TVG-SLAM, a robust RGB-only 3DGS SLAM system that leverages a novel
tri-view geometry paradigm to ensure consistent tracking and high-quality
mapping. We introduce a dense tri-view matching module that aggregates reliable
pairwise correspondences into consistent tri-view matches, forming robust
geometric constraints across frames. For tracking, we propose Hybrid Geometric
Constraints, which leverage tri-view matches to construct complementary
geometric cues alongside photometric loss, ensuring accurate and stable pose
estimation even under drastic viewpoint shifts and lighting variations. For
mapping, we propose a new probabilistic initialization strategy that encodes
geometric uncertainty from tri-view correspondences into newly initialized
Gaussians. Additionally, we design a Dynamic Attenuation of Rendering Trust
mechanism to mitigate tracking drift caused by mapping latency. Experiments on
multiple public outdoor datasets show that our TVG-SLAM outperforms prior
RGB-only 3DGS-based SLAM systems. Notably, in the most challenging dataset, our
method improves tracking robustness, reducing the average Absolute Trajectory
Error (ATE) by 69.0\% while achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality. The
implementation of our method will be released as open-source.

Abstract: Timely and accurate diagnosis of appendicitis is critical in clinical
settings to prevent serious complications. While CT imaging remains the
standard diagnostic tool, the growing number of cases can overwhelm
radiologists, potentially causing delays. In this paper, we propose a deep
learning model that leverages 3D CT scans for appendicitis classification,
incorporating Slice Attention mechanisms guided by external 2D datasets to
enhance small lesion detection. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical
classification framework using pre-trained 2D models to differentiate between
simple and complicated appendicitis. Our approach improves AUC by 3% for

Conclusion: 所提方法通过多模态信息和语义一致性模块，有效解决了场景级标注下的伪标签生成问题，提升了分割性能。

Abstract: This paper investigates indoor point cloud semantic segmentation under
scene-level annotation, which is less explored compared to methods relying on
sparse point-level labels. In the absence of precise point-level labels,
current methods first generate point-level pseudo-labels, which are then used
to train segmentation models. However, generating accurate pseudo-labels for
each point solely based on scene-level annotations poses a considerable
challenge, substantially affecting segmentation performance. Consequently, to
enhance accuracy, this paper proposes a high-quality pseudo-label generation
framework by exploring contemporary multi-modal information and region-point
semantic consistency. Specifically, with a cross-modal feature guidance module,
our method utilizes 2D-3D correspondences to align point cloud features with
corresponding 2D image pixels, thereby assisting point cloud feature learning.
To further alleviate the challenge presented by the scene-level annotation, we
introduce a region-point semantic consistency module. It produces regional
semantics through a region-voting strategy derived from point-level semantics,
which are subsequently employed to guide the point-level semantic predictions.
Leveraging the aforementioned modules, our method can rectify inaccurate
point-level semantic predictions during training and obtain high-quality
pseudo-labels. Significant improvements over previous works on ScanNet v2 and
S3DIS datasets under scene-level annotation can demonstrate the effectiveness.
Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the contributions of our
approach's individual components. The code is available at

Result: VolumetricSMPL比COAP快10倍，GPU内存使用降低6倍，精度更高，并支持SDF接触建模。

Conclusion: VolumetricSMPL在多项任务中表现优异，展示了其广泛适用性和高效性。

Abstract: Parametric human body models play a crucial role in computer graphics and
vision, enabling applications ranging from human motion analysis to
understanding human-environment interactions. Traditionally, these models use
surface meshes, which pose challenges in efficiently handling interactions with
other geometric entities, such as objects and scenes, typically represented as
meshes or point clouds. To address this limitation, recent research has
explored volumetric neural implicit body models. However, existing works are
either insufficiently robust for complex human articulations or impose high
computational and memory costs, limiting their widespread use. To this end, we
introduce VolumetricSMPL, a neural volumetric body model that leverages Neural
Blend Weights (NBW) to generate compact, yet efficient MLP decoders. Unlike
prior approaches that rely on large MLPs, NBW dynamically blends a small set of
learned weight matrices using predicted shape- and pose-dependent coefficients,
significantly improving computational efficiency while preserving
expressiveness. VolumetricSMPL outperforms prior volumetric occupancy model
COAP with 10x faster inference, 6x lower GPU memory usage, enhanced accuracy,
and a Signed Distance Function (SDF) for efficient and differentiable contact
modeling. We demonstrate VolumetricSMPL's strengths across four challenging
tasks: (1) reconstructing human-object interactions from in-the-wild images,
(2) recovering human meshes in 3D scenes from egocentric views, (3)
scene-constrained motion synthesis, and (4) resolving self-intersections. Our
results highlight its broad applicability and significant performance and
efficiency gains.

Motivation: 深度学习在图像分类任务中占主导地位，但理解模型如何做出预测仍具挑战性。现有方法要么过于局部（如显著性图），要么过于全局化，难以捕捉重要局部行为。

Method: 提出SATs方法，利用图像片段（如“眼睛”）和显著性图量化其影响力，总结局部显著性解释为全局见解。

Result: SATs揭示了模型依赖的概念和虚假相关性（如背景或水印），即使测试性能变化不大。

Conclusion: SATs为分析和调试图像分类器提供了一种实用工具，填补了现有解释方法的不足。

Abstract: Deep learning dominates image classification tasks, yet understanding how
models arrive at predictions remains a challenge. Much research focuses on
local explanations of individual predictions, such as saliency maps, which
visualise the influence of specific pixels on a model's prediction. However,
reviewing many of these explanations to identify recurring patterns is
infeasible, while global methods often oversimplify and miss important local
behaviours. To address this, we propose Segment Attribution Tables (SATs), a
method for summarising local saliency explanations into (semi-)global insights.
SATs take image segments (such as "eyes" in Chihuahuas) and leverage saliency
maps to quantify their influence. These segments highlight concepts the model
relies on across instances and reveal spurious correlations, such as reliance
on backgrounds or watermarks, even when out-of-distribution test performance
sees little change. SATs can explain any classifier for which a form of
saliency map can be produced, using segmentation maps that provide named
segments. SATs bridge the gap between oversimplified global summaries and
overly detailed local explanations, offering a practical tool for analysing and
debugging image classifiers.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has highlighted
the importance of robust and efficient object detection in diverse aerial
scenarios. Detecting small objects under complex conditions, however, remains a
significant challenge. Existing approaches often prioritize inference speed,
leading to degraded performance when handling multi-modal inputs. To address
this, we present DGE-YOLO, an enhanced YOLO-based detection framework designed
to effectively fuse multi-modal information. Specifically, we introduce a
dual-branch architecture for modality-specific feature extraction, enabling the
model to process both infrared and visible images. To further enrich semantic
representation, we propose an Efficient Multi-scale Attention (EMA) mechanism
that enhances feature learning across spatial scales. Additionally, we replace
the conventional neck with a Gather-and-Distribute module to mitigate
information loss during feature aggregation. Extensive experiments on the Drone
Vehicle dataset demonstrate that DGE-YOLO achieves superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness in multi-modal UAV
object detection tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion-model-based image super-resolution techniques often face a
trade-off between realistic image generation and computational efficiency. This
issue is exacerbated when inference times by decreasing sampling steps,
resulting in less realistic and hazy images. To overcome this challenge, we
introduce a novel diffusion model named PixelBoost that underscores the
significance of embracing the stochastic nature of Brownian motion in advancing
image super-resolution, resulting in a high degree of realism, particularly
focusing on texture and edge definitions. By integrating controlled
stochasticity into the training regimen, our proposed model avoids convergence
to local optima, effectively capturing and reproducing the inherent uncertainty
of image textures and patterns. Our proposed model demonstrates superior
objective results in terms of learned perceptual image patch similarity
(LPIPS), lightness order error (LOE), peak signal-to-noise ratio(PSNR),
structural similarity index measure (SSIM), as well as visual quality. To
determine the edge enhancement, we evaluated the gradient magnitude and pixel
value, and our proposed model exhibited a better edge reconstruction
capability. Additionally, our model demonstrates adaptive learning capabilities
by effectively adjusting to Brownian noise patterns and introduces a sigmoidal
noise sequencing method that simplifies training, resulting in faster inference
speeds.

TL;DR: PCLVis框架通过MPI通信数据帮助用户分析进程通信延迟事件，提高大规模模拟的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模模拟在超级计算机上的通信延迟问题严重，现有方法依赖管理员才能获取的物理链路层信息，不适用于普通用户。

Method: PCLVis利用MPI通信数据，通过进程相关性树和通信依赖DAG分析事件传播路径，设计了CS-Glyph展示通信状态，并提供事件归因策略。

Result: 在TH-1A超级计算机上的实验表明，PCLVis能有效帮助用户优化模拟效率。

Conclusion: PCLVis为普通用户提供了一种无需物理链路层信息的通信延迟分析工具，显著提升了模拟效率。

Abstract: Large-scale simulations on supercomputers have become important tools for
users. However, their scalability remains a problem due to the huge
communication cost among parallel processes. Most of the existing communication
latency analysis methods rely on the physical link layer information, which is
only available to administrators. In this paper, a framework called PCLVis is
proposed to help general users analyze process communication latency (PCL)
events. Instead of the physical link layer information, the PCLVis uses the MPI
process communication data for the analysis. First, a spatial PCL event
locating method is developed. All processes with high correlation are
classified into a single cluster by constructing a process-correlation tree.
Second, the propagation path of PCL events is analyzed by constructing a
communication-dependency-based directed acyclic graph (DAG), which can help
users interactively explore a PCL event from the temporal evolution of a
located PCL event cluster. In this graph, a sliding window algorithm is
designed to generate the PCL events abstraction. Meanwhile, a new glyph called
the communication state glyph (CS-Glyph) is designed for each process to show
its communication states, including its in/out messages and load balance. Each
leaf node can be further unfolded to view additional information. Third, a PCL
event attribution strategy is formulated to help users optimize their
simulations. The effectiveness of the PCLVis framework is demonstrated by
analyzing the PCL events of several simulations running on the TH-1A
supercomputer. By using the proposed framework, users can greatly improve the
efficiency of their simulations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提升自动驾驶汽车的安全性，需要合成具有因果关系的交通事故视频以测试其应对能力，但现有方法难以将真实视频中的因果关系融入合成视频中。

Method: 提出Causal-VidSyn扩散模型，利用原因描述和驾驶员注视点，通过事故原因回答和注视条件选择模块实现因果实体定位。

Result: Causal-VidSyn在帧质量和因果敏感性方面优于现有视频扩散模型，适用于事故视频编辑、正常到事故视频扩散和文本到视频生成任务。

Conclusion: Causal-VidSyn通过结合因果关系和驾驶员注视点，显著提升了合成交通事故视频的质量和实用性。

Abstract: Egocentricly comprehending the causes and effects of car accidents is crucial
for the safety of self-driving cars, and synthesizing causal-entity reflected
accident videos can facilitate the capability test to respond to unaffordable
accidents in reality. However, incorporating causal relations as seen in
real-world videos into synthetic videos remains challenging. This work argues
that precisely identifying the accident participants and capturing their
related behaviors are of critical importance. In this regard, we propose a
novel diffusion model, Causal-VidSyn, for synthesizing egocentric traffic
accident videos. To enable causal entity grounding in video diffusion,
Causal-VidSyn leverages the cause descriptions and driver fixations to identify
the accident participants and behaviors, facilitated by accident reason
answering and gaze-conditioned selection modules. To support Causal-VidSyn, we
further construct Drive-Gaze, the largest driver gaze dataset (with 1.54M
frames of fixations) in driving accident scenarios. Extensive experiments show
that Causal-VidSyn surpasses state-of-the-art video diffusion models in terms
of frame quality and causal sensitivity in various tasks, including accident
video editing, normal-to-accident video diffusion, and text-to-video
generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Token Activation Map (TAM)的方法，用于提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的可解释性，通过因果推理和秩高斯滤波器减少冗余激活干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs的可解释性研究不足，冗余激活干扰解释可靠性，影响模型理解和可视化效果。

Method: 提出TAM方法，结合因果推理和秩高斯滤波器，减少上下文冗余激活对后续令牌解释的干扰。

Result: TAM显著优于现有方法，适用于多种场景（如目标定位、失败案例分析、视频可视化等）。

Conclusion: TAM为MLLMs提供了高质量的可视化解释工具，提升了模型理解和可靠性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are broadly empowering various
fields. Despite their advancements, the explainability of MLLMs remains less
explored, hindering deeper understanding, model credibility, and effective
visualization. Unlike conventional vision models (e.g., CNNs, ViTs, CLIP) that
produce a single output, MLLMs generate sequences of tokens progressively,
where each generated token depends on the previous context. Therefore, earlier
context tokens can introduce redundant activations that interfere with the
explanation of later tokens beyond their original information. Existing studies
often overlook this issue, but our observations reveal that these redundant
correlations can significantly hurt the reliability of explanations. To address
this, we propose an estimated causal inference method to mitigate the
interference of context to achieve high-quality MLLM explanation, with a novel
rank Gaussian filter to further reduce activation noises. We term this method
Token Activation Map (TAM) to highlight the consideration of interactions
between tokens. TAM also indicates that it excels at explaining multiple tokens
of MLLM, which is different from the Class Activation Map (CAM) for a single
prediction. Our TAM method significantly outperforms existing SoTA methods,
showcasing high-quality visualization results that can be utilized for various
scenarios, such as object localization, failure case analysis, video
visualization, MLLMs visual comparison, and model understanding (e.g., color,
shape, action, location, visual reasoning, multi-turn conversation, etc). The

Motivation: 解决大规模预训练Transformer模型在下游视听任务中内存占用高和训练时间长的问题。

Method: 使用轻量级的Layer-Centric Distillation (LCD)模块并行蒸馏特征为元标记，并引入Meta-Token Injection (MTI)模块支持细粒度分割任务。

Result: 在多个视听基准测试中显著减少内存使用和训练时间，同时保持竞争性准确性。

Conclusion: Mettle是一种简单且高效的方法，适用于多种视听任务，平衡了性能和资源消耗。

Abstract: We present \textbf{Met}a-\textbf{T}oken \textbf{Le}arning (Mettle), a simple
and memory-efficient method for adapting large-scale pretrained transformer
models to downstream audio-visual tasks. Instead of sequentially modifying the
output feature distribution of the transformer backbone, Mettle utilizes a
lightweight \textit{Layer-Centric Distillation (LCD)} module to distill in
parallel the intact audio or visual features embedded by each transformer layer
into compact meta-tokens. This distillation process considers both pretrained
knowledge preservation and task-specific adaptation. The obtained meta-tokens
can be directly applied to classification tasks, such as audio-visual event
localization and audio-visual video parsing. To further support fine-grained
segmentation tasks, such as audio-visual segmentation, we introduce a
\textit{Meta-Token Injection (MTI)} module, which utilizes the audio and visual
meta-tokens distilled from the top transformer layer to guide feature
adaptation in earlier layers. Extensive experiments on multiple audiovisual
benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly reduces memory usage and
training time while maintaining parameter efficiency and competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: AutoT2IS在文本到图像集生成中表现出色，具有重要的实际价值。

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in Text-to-Image models, many real-world
applications require generating coherent image sets with diverse consistency
requirements. Existing consistent methods often focus on a specific domain with
specific aspects of consistency, which significantly constrains their
generalizability to broader applications. In this paper, we propose a more
challenging problem, Text-to-ImageSet (T2IS) generation, which aims to generate
sets of images that meet various consistency requirements based on user
instructions. To systematically study this problem, we first introduce
$\textbf{T2IS-Bench}$ with 596 diverse instructions across 26 subcategories,
providing comprehensive coverage for T2IS generation. Building on this, we
propose $\textbf{T2IS-Eval}$, an evaluation framework that transforms user
instructions into multifaceted assessment criteria and employs effective
evaluators to adaptively assess consistency fulfillment between criteria and
generated sets. Subsequently, we propose $\textbf{AutoT2IS}$, a training-free
framework that maximally leverages pretrained Diffusion Transformers'
in-context capabilities to harmonize visual elements to satisfy both
image-level prompt alignment and set-level visual consistency. Extensive
experiments on T2IS-Bench reveal that diverse consistency challenges all
existing methods, while our AutoT2IS significantly outperforms current
generalized and even specialized approaches. Our method also demonstrates the
ability to enable numerous underexplored real-world applications, confirming
its substantial practical value. Visit our project in

Result: 在三个流行的视频异常检测基准测试中，该方法表现出最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过综合考虑场景、运动和外观三个问题，该方法能够计算更全面的异常指标，显著提升检测效果。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is an important computer vision problem. Thanks
to the mode coverage capabilities of generative models, the likelihood-based
paradigm is catching growing interest, as it can model normal distribution and
detect out-of-distribution anomalies. However, these likelihood-based methods
are blind to the anomalies located in local modes near the learned
distribution. To handle these ``unseen" anomalies, we dive into three gaps
uniquely existing in VAD regarding scene, motion and appearance. Specifically,
we first build a noise-conditioned score transformer for denoising score
matching. Then, we introduce a scene-dependent and motion-aware score function
by embedding the scene condition of input sequences into our model and
assigning motion weights based on the difference between key frames of input
sequences. Next, to solve the problem of blindness in principle, we integrate
unaffected visual information via a novel autoregressive denoising score
matching mechanism for inference. Through autoregressively injecting
intensifying Gaussian noise into the denoised data and estimating the
corresponding score function, we compare the denoised data with the original
data to get a difference and aggregate it with the score function for an
enhanced appearance perception and accumulate the abnormal context. With all
three gaps considered, we can compute a more comprehensive anomaly indicator.
Experiments on three popular VAD benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art
performance of our method.

Conclusion: MoMa通过高效时空建模显著提升了视频理解性能。

Abstract: Video understanding is a complex challenge that requires effective modeling
of spatial-temporal dynamics. With the success of image foundation models
(IFMs) in image understanding, recent approaches have explored
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to adapt IFMs for video. However, most
of these methods tend to process spatial and temporal information separately,
which may fail to capture the full intricacy of video dynamics. In this paper,
we propose MoMa, an efficient adapter framework that achieves full
spatial-temporal modeling by integrating Mamba's selective state space modeling
into IFMs. We propose a novel SeqMod operation to inject spatial-temporal
information into pre-trained IFMs, without disrupting their original features.
By incorporating SeqMod into a Divide-and-Modulate architecture, MoMa enhances
video understanding while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive
experiments on multiple video benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of MoMa,
achieving superior performance with reduced computational cost.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have significantly advanced the field of computer
vision. To improve DNN training process, knowledge distillation methods
demonstrate their effectiveness in accelerating network training by introducing
a fixed learning direction from the teacher network to student networks. In
this context, several distillation-based optimization strategies are proposed,
e.g., deep mutual learning and self-distillation, as an attempt to achieve
generic training performance enhancement through the cooperative training of
multiple networks. However, such strategies achieve limited improvements due to
the poor understanding of the impact of learning directions among networks
across different iterations. In this paper, we propose a novel competitive
distillation strategy that allows each network in a group to potentially act as
a teacher based on its performance, enhancing the overall learning performance.
Competitive distillation organizes a group of networks to perform a shared task
and engage in competition, where competitive optimization is proposed to
improve the parameter updating process. We further introduce stochastic
perturbation in competitive distillation, aiming to motivate networks to induce
mutations to achieve better visual representations and global optimum. The
experimental results show that competitive distillation achieves promising
performance in diverse tasks and datasets.

Abstract: Recent advances in AIGC have exacerbated the misuse of malicious deepfake
content, making the development of reliable deepfake detection methods an
essential means to address this challenge. Although existing deepfake detection
models demonstrate outstanding performance in detection metrics, most methods
only provide simple binary classification results, lacking interpretability. In
critical domains such as law, interpretability is crucial for enhancing the
credibility and authority of decisions. Recent studies attempt to improve the
interpretability of classification results by providing spatial manipulation
masks or temporal forgery segments. However, the practical effectiveness of
these methods remains suboptimal due to limitations of the forgery data. Most
current deepfake datasets predominantly offer binary labels, only a few
datasets with localization annotations. However, they suffer from restricted
forgery scenarios, limited diversity in deepfake types, and insufficient data
scale, making them inadequate for complex real-world scenarios. To address this
predicament, we construct a novel large-scale deepfake detection and
localization ($\textbf{DDL}$) dataset containing over $\textbf{1.8M}$ forged
samples and encompassing up to $\textbf{75}$ distinct deepfake methods. The DDL
design incorporates four key innovations: (1) $\textbf{Diverse Forgery
Scenarios}$, (2) $\textbf{Comprehensive Deepfake Methods}$, (3) $\textbf{Varied
Manipulation Modes}$, and (4) $\textbf{Fine-grained Forgery Annotations}$.
Through these improvements, our DDL not only provides a more challenging
benchmark for complex real-world forgeries, but also offers crucial support for
building next-generation deepfake detection, localization, and interpretability
methods. The DDL dataset project page is on

Motivation: 虚拟试穿（VTON）在电子商务和数字时尚中有广泛应用，但现有方法在服装细节保留、对齐和效率方面存在挑战。

Method: DiffFit采用两阶段策略：第一阶段通过几何感知变形对齐服装与目标身体；第二阶段通过跨模态条件扩散模型优化纹理保真度。

Result: 实验表明，DiffFit在定量指标和感知评估上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DiffFit通过解耦几何对齐和外观优化，显著提升了虚拟试穿的生成稳定性和视觉真实感。

Abstract: Virtual try-on (VTON) aims to synthesize realistic images of a person wearing
a target garment, with broad applications in e-commerce and digital fashion.
While recent advances in latent diffusion models have substantially improved
visual quality, existing approaches still struggle with preserving fine-grained
garment details, achieving precise garment-body alignment, maintaining
inference efficiency, and generalizing to diverse poses and clothing styles. To
address these challenges, we propose DiffFit, a novel two-stage latent
diffusion framework for high-fidelity virtual try-on. DiffFit adopts a
progressive generation strategy: the first stage performs geometry-aware
garment warping, aligning the garment with the target body through fine-grained
deformation and pose adaptation. The second stage refines texture fidelity via
a cross-modal conditional diffusion model that integrates the warped garment,
the original garment appearance, and the target person image for high-quality
rendering. By decoupling geometric alignment and appearance refinement, DiffFit
effectively reduces task complexity and enhances both generation stability and
visual realism. It excels in preserving garment-specific attributes such as
textures, wrinkles, and lighting, while ensuring accurate alignment with the
human body. Extensive experiments on large-scale VTON benchmarks demonstrate
that DiffFit achieves superior performance over existing state-of-the-art
methods in both quantitative metrics and perceptual evaluations.

Result: Endo-4DGX在低光和过曝条件下均表现出色，几何精度高，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Endo-4DGX有望推动机器人辅助手术应用，代码已开源。

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of soft tissue is crucial for advancing automation in
image-guided robotic surgery. The recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
techniques and their variants, 4DGS, achieve high-quality renderings of dynamic
surgical scenes in real-time. However, 3D-GS-based methods still struggle in
scenarios with varying illumination, such as low light and over-exposure.
Training 3D-GS in such extreme light conditions leads to severe optimization
problems and devastating rendering quality. To address these challenges, we
present Endo-4DGX, a novel reconstruction method with illumination-adaptive
Gaussian Splatting designed specifically for endoscopic scenes with uneven
lighting. By incorporating illumination embeddings, our method effectively
models view-dependent brightness variations. We introduce a region-aware
enhancement module to model the sub-area lightness at the Gaussian level and a
spatial-aware adjustment module to learn the view-consistent brightness
adjustment. With the illumination adaptive design, Endo-4DGX achieves superior
rendering performance under both low-light and over-exposure conditions while
maintaining geometric accuracy. Additionally, we employ an exposure control
loss to restore the appearance from adverse exposure to the normal level for
illumination-adaptive optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that
Endo-4DGX significantly outperforms combinations of state-of-the-art
reconstruction and restoration methods in challenging lighting environments,
underscoring its potential to advance robot-assisted surgical applications. Our
code is available at https://github.com/lastbasket/Endo-4DGX.

Result: 在PASCAL VOC等基准测试中达到43.8%的平均mIoU，同时保持高效推理。

Conclusion: FastSeg在分割质量和效率之间取得平衡，为扩展性提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) aims to segment objects from
arbitrary text categories without requiring densely annotated datasets.
Although contrastive learning based models enable zero-shot segmentation, they
often lose fine spatial precision at pixel level, due to global representation
bias. In contrast, diffusion-based models naturally encode fine-grained spatial
features via attention mechanisms that capture both global context and local
details. However, they often face challenges in balancing the number of
iterations with the quality of the segmentation. In this work, we propose
FastSeg, a novel and efficient training-free framework with only (1+1)-step of
reverse process of a pretrained diffusion model (e.g., Stable Diffusion).
Moreover, instead of running multiple times for different classes, FastSeg
performs segmentation for all classes at once. To further enhance the
segmentation quality, FastSeg introduces three key components: (i) a
dual-prompt mechanism for discriminative, class-aware attention extraction,
(ii) a Hierarchical Attention Refinement Method (HARD) that enhances fused
cross-attention using scale-aligned selfattention maps, and (iii) a Test-Time
Flipping (TTF) scheme designed to improve spatial consistency. Extensive
experiments show that FastSeg achieves state-of-the-art training-free
performance, obtaining 43.8% average mIoU across PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context,
and COCO Object benchmarks while maintaining superior inference efficiency. Our
results demonstrate that FastSeg provides a strong foundation for
extendability, bridging the gap between segmentation quality and inference
efficiency.

Conclusion: IR3D-Bench为系统研究和开发工具使用的VLAs提供了数据与评估协议，以推动真正的场景理解。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at descriptive tasks, but whether they
truly understand scenes from visual observations remains uncertain. We
introduce IR3D-Bench, a benchmark challenging VLMs to demonstrate understanding
through active creation rather than passive recognition. Grounded in the
analysis-by-synthesis paradigm, IR3D-Bench tasks Vision-Language Agents (VLAs)
with actively using programming and rendering tools to recreate the underlying
3D structure of an input image, achieving agentic inverse rendering through
tool use. This "understanding-by-creating" approach probes the tool-using
generative capacity of VLAs, moving beyond the descriptive or conversational
capacity measured by traditional scene understanding benchmarks. We provide a
comprehensive suite of metrics to evaluate geometric accuracy, spatial
relations, appearance attributes, and overall plausibility. Initial experiments
on agentic inverse rendering powered by various state-of-the-art VLMs highlight
current limitations, particularly in visual precision rather than basic tool
usage. IR3D-Bench, including data and evaluation protocols, is released to
facilitate systematic study and development of tool-using VLAs towards genuine

Motivation: 传统基于向量量化的方法在无监督图像翻译中因离散量化导致梯度中断，限制了端到端优化。

Conclusion: CycleVAR通过梯度保留和高效生成模式，显著提升了无监督图像翻译的性能。

Abstract: The current conditional autoregressive image generation methods have shown
promising results, yet their potential remains largely unexplored in the
practical unsupervised image translation domain, which operates without
explicit cross-domain correspondences. A critical limitation stems from the
discrete quantization inherent in traditional Vector Quantization-based
frameworks, which disrupts gradient flow between the Variational Autoencoder
decoder and causal Transformer, impeding end-to-end optimization during
adversarial training in image space. To tackle this issue, we propose using
Softmax Relaxed Quantization, a novel approach that reformulates codebook
selection as a continuous probability mixing process via Softmax, thereby
preserving gradient propagation. Building upon this differentiable foundation,
we introduce CycleVAR, which reformulates image-to-image translation as
image-conditional visual autoregressive generation by injecting multi-scale
source image tokens as contextual prompts, analogous to prefix-based
conditioning in language models. CycleVAR exploits two modes to generate the
target image tokens, including (1) serial multi-step generation, enabling
iterative refinement across scales, and (2) parallel one-step generation
synthesizing all resolution outputs in a single forward pass. Experimental
findings indicate that the parallel one-step generation mode attains superior
translation quality with quicker inference speed than the serial multi-step
mode in unsupervised scenarios. Furthermore, both quantitative and qualitative
results indicate that CycleVAR surpasses previous state-of-the-art unsupervised
image translation models, \textit{e}.\textit{g}., CycleGAN-Turbo.

TL;DR: GeoProg3D是一个视觉编程框架，通过自然语言实现城市规模高保真3D场景的交互，结合地理感知和视觉API，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D语言方法在小规模环境中表现良好，但缺乏处理大规模复杂城市环境的能力。

Method: 提出GeoProg3D框架，包含地理感知城市规模3D语言场（GCLF）和地理视觉API（GV-APIs），利用LLM动态组合工具。

Result: 在GeoEval3D基准测试中，GeoProg3D在多项任务中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GeoProg3D首次实现了通过自然语言在城市规模3D环境中进行组合地理推理。

Abstract: The advancement of 3D language fields has enabled intuitive interactions with
3D scenes via natural language. However, existing approaches are typically
limited to small-scale environments, lacking the scalability and compositional
reasoning capabilities necessary for large, complex urban settings. To overcome
these limitations, we propose GeoProg3D, a visual programming framework that
enables natural language-driven interactions with city-scale high-fidelity 3D
scenes. GeoProg3D consists of two key components: (i) a Geography-aware
City-scale 3D Language Field (GCLF) that leverages a memory-efficient
hierarchical 3D model to handle large-scale data, integrated with geographic
information for efficiently filtering vast urban spaces using directional cues,
distance measurements, elevation data, and landmark references; and (ii)
Geographical Vision APIs (GV-APIs), specialized geographic vision tools such as
area segmentation and object detection. Our framework employs large language
models (LLMs) as reasoning engines to dynamically combine GV-APIs and operate
GCLF, effectively supporting diverse geographic vision tasks. To assess
performance in city-scale reasoning, we introduce GeoEval3D, a comprehensive
benchmark dataset containing 952 query-answer pairs across five challenging
tasks: grounding, spatial reasoning, comparison, counting, and measurement.
Experiments demonstrate that GeoProg3D significantly outperforms existing 3D
language fields and vision-language models across multiple tasks. To our
knowledge, GeoProg3D is the first framework enabling compositional geographic
reasoning in high-fidelity city-scale 3D environments via natural language. The

TL;DR: 提出了一种面向任务的红外图像增强方法，通过分层分解和显著性信息提取，提升图像质量，适用于复杂天气条件下的自动驾驶感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外图像在复杂天气条件下（如雾、雨、低光）能提升自动驾驶感知能力，但低对比度问题（尤其是非热辐射目标）影响下游视觉任务性能，且增强对比度时需避免噪声放大和信息丢失。

Method: 方法包括分层分解和显著性信息提取。分层分解增强场景细节并保留暗区特征；基于形态学重建的显著性提取方法有效增强目标信息且不放大噪声。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在目标检测和语义分割任务中优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了红外图像低对比度问题，提升了自动驾驶感知能力。

Abstract: Infrared image helps improve the perception capabilities of autonomous
driving in complex weather conditions such as fog, rain, and low light.
However, infrared image often suffers from low contrast, especially in
non-heat-emitting targets like bicycles, which significantly affects the
performance of downstream high-level vision tasks. Furthermore, achieving
contrast enhancement without amplifying noise and losing important information
remains a challenge. To address these challenges, we propose a task-oriented
infrared image enhancement method. Our approach consists of two key components:
layer decomposition and saliency information extraction. First, we design an
layer decomposition method for infrared images, which enhances scene details
while preserving dark region features, providing more features for subsequent
saliency information extraction. Then, we propose a morphological
reconstruction-based saliency extraction method that effectively extracts and
enhances target information without amplifying noise. Our method improves the
image quality for object detection and semantic segmentation tasks. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要针对单主题场景，且缺乏对多主题数据和控制信号（如深度、掩码等）的研究。

Method: 提出VideoCus-Factory数据构造管道和IVTM训练方法，结合OmniVCus框架（包含Lottery Embedding和Temporally Aligned Embedding机制）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在定量和定性评估中显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法在多主题视频定制和控制信号利用方面取得了显著进展。

Abstract: Existing feedforward subject-driven video customization methods mainly study
single-subject scenarios due to the difficulty of constructing multi-subject
training data pairs. Another challenging problem that how to use the signals
such as depth, mask, camera, and text prompts to control and edit the subject
in the customized video is still less explored. In this paper, we first propose
a data construction pipeline, VideoCus-Factory, to produce training data pairs
for multi-subject customization from raw videos without labels and control
signals such as depth-to-video and mask-to-video pairs. Based on our
constructed data, we develop an Image-Video Transfer Mixed (IVTM) training with
image editing data to enable instructive editing for the subject in the
customized video. Then we propose a diffusion Transformer framework, OmniVCus,
with two embedding mechanisms, Lottery Embedding (LE) and Temporally Aligned
Embedding (TAE). LE enables inference with more subjects by using the training
subjects to activate more frame embeddings. TAE encourages the generation
process to extract guidance from temporally aligned control signals by
assigning the same frame embeddings to the control and noise tokens.
Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

TL;DR: SIEDD是一种新型架构，通过共享编码器和离散解码器显著加速INR编码，同时保持高质量和坐标级控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决INR编码速度慢的问题，同时避免牺牲重建质量或坐标级控制。

Method: 使用共享编码器捕获全局低频特征，并行训练轻量级离散解码器，结合坐标空间采样加速。

Result: 在HD和4K基准测试中，编码速度提升20-30倍，保持高质量和压缩比。

Conclusion: SIEDD为高保真神经视频压缩提供了实用化路径，支持连续分辨率解码和低成本转码。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) offer exceptional fidelity for video
compression by learning per-video optimized functions, but their adoption is
crippled by impractically slow encoding times. Existing attempts to accelerate
INR encoding often sacrifice reconstruction quality or crucial coordinate-level
control essential for adaptive streaming and transcoding. We introduce SIEDD
(Shared-Implicit Encoder with Discrete Decoders), a novel architecture that
fundamentally accelerates INR encoding without these compromises. SIEDD first
rapidly trains a shared, coordinate-based encoder on sparse anchor frames to
efficiently capture global, low-frequency video features. This encoder is then
frozen, enabling massively parallel training of lightweight, discrete decoders
for individual frame groups, further expedited by aggressive coordinate-space
sampling. This synergistic design delivers a remarkable 20-30X encoding
speed-up over state-of-the-art INR codecs on HD and 4K benchmarks, while
maintaining competitive reconstruction quality and compression ratios.
Critically, SIEDD retains full coordinate-based control, enabling continuous
resolution decoding and eliminating costly transcoding. Our approach
significantly advances the practicality of high-fidelity neural video
compression, demonstrating a scalable and efficient path towards real-world
deployment. Our codebase is available at

Abstract: Smartphone-based heart rate (HR) monitoring apps using finger-over-camera
photoplethysmography (PPG) face significant challenges in performance
evaluation and device compatibility due to device variability and
fragmentation. Manual testing is impractical, and standardized methods are
lacking. This paper presents a novel, high-throughput bench-testing platform to
address this critical need. We designed a system comprising a test rig capable
of holding 12 smartphones for parallel testing, a method for generating
synthetic PPG test videos with controllable HR and signal quality, and a host
machine for coordinating video playback and data logging. The system achieved a
mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.11% +/- 0.001% between input and
measured HR, and a correlation coefficient of 0.92 +/- 0.008 between input and
measured PPG signals using a clinically-validated smartphone-based HR app.
Bench-testing results of 20 different smartphone models correctly classified
all the devices as meeting the ANSI/CTA accuracy standards for HR monitors
(MAPE <10%) when compared to a prospective clinical study with 80 participants,
demonstrating high positive predictive value. This platform offers a scalable
solution for pre-deployment testing of smartphone HR apps to improve app
performance, ensure device compatibility, and advance the field of mobile
health.

Motivation: 文本到图像模型在生成复杂空间关系时表现不佳，尤其是难以准确反映输入提示中的空间配置。

Method: 提出了PoS-based Evaluation (PSE)作为评估指标，以及PoS-based Generation (PSG)作为推理时方法，通过梯度引导或搜索策略优化空间关系生成。

Result: PSE指标比传统方法更符合人类判断，PSG显著提升了模型在空间关系生成上的表现。

Conclusion: 该框架为文本到图像模型的空间关系生成提供了更可靠和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the ability of text-to-image models to generate high-quality,
realistic, and diverse images, they face challenges in compositional
generation, often struggling to accurately represent details specified in the
input prompt. A prevalent issue in compositional generation is the misalignment
of spatial relationships, as models often fail to faithfully generate images
that reflect the spatial configurations specified between objects in the input
prompts. To address this challenge, we propose a novel probabilistic framework
for modeling the relative spatial positioning of objects in a scene, leveraging
the concept of Probability of Superiority (PoS). Building on this insight, we
make two key contributions. First, we introduce a novel evaluation metric,
PoS-based Evaluation (PSE), designed to assess the alignment of 2D and 3D
spatial relationships between text and image, with improved adherence to human
judgment. Second, we propose PoS-based Generation (PSG), an inference-time
method that improves the alignment of 2D and 3D spatial relationships in T2I
models without requiring fine-tuning. PSG employs a Part-of-Speech PoS-based
reward function that can be utilized in two distinct ways: (1) as a
gradient-based guidance mechanism applied to the cross-attention maps during
the denoising steps, or (2) as a search-based strategy that evaluates a set of
initial noise vectors to select the best one. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that the PSE metric exhibits stronger alignment with human judgment compared to
traditional center-based metrics, providing a more nuanced and reliable measure
of complex spatial relationship accuracy in text-image alignment. Furthermore,
PSG significantly enhances the ability of text-to-image models to generate
images with specified spatial configurations, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods across multiple evaluation metrics and benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的目标检测方法，将重点从基于类别的分类转向对象危害性判断，以提升自动驾驶车辆的安全决策能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统目标检测方法无法有效处理分布外（OOD）对象，可能导致自动驾驶车辆误判或漏检，引发安全隐患。

Method: 通过对象相对于自动驾驶车辆的位置和轨迹，将其分类为‘有害’或‘无害’，而非具体类别。

Result: 模型能有效检测OOD对象并评估其危害性，从而提升自动驾驶车辆在动态环境中的决策效果。

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升了自动驾驶车辆对未知对象的识别和响应能力，增强了安全性。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) use object detection models to recognize their
surroundings and make driving decisions accordingly. Conventional object
detection approaches classify objects into known classes, which limits the AV's
ability to detect and appropriately respond to Out-of-Distribution (OOD)
objects. This problem is a significant safety concern since the AV may fail to
detect objects or misclassify them, which can potentially lead to hazardous
situations such as accidents. Consequently, we propose a novel object detection
approach that shifts the emphasis from conventional class-based classification
to object harmfulness determination. Instead of object detection by their
specific class, our method identifies them as either 'harmful' or 'harmless'
based on whether they pose a danger to the AV. This is done based on the object
position relative to the AV and its trajectory. With this metric, our model can
effectively detect previously unseen objects to enable the AV to make safer
real-time decisions. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model
effectively detects OOD objects, evaluates their harmfulness, and classifies
them accordingly, thus enhancing the AV decision-making effectiveness in
dynamic environments.

Motivation: 探索LiDAR世界模型在多领域的可转移性，减少对标注数据的依赖，并解决现有模型的低效问题。

Method: 进行系统性的领域转移研究，提出基于潜在条件流匹配（CFM）的框架，优化数据压缩和训练目标。

Result: 预训练模型在多个领域转移中表现优异，新框架在重建精度和计算效率上达到SOTA。

Conclusion: LiDAR世界模型在多领域转移中具有潜力，新框架显著提升了性能和效率。

Abstract: LiDAR-based world models offer more structured and geometry-aware
representations than their image-based counterparts. However, existing LiDAR
world models are narrowly trained; each model excels only in the domain for
which it was built. Can we develop LiDAR world models that exhibit strong
transferability across multiple domains? We conduct the first systematic domain
transfer study across three demanding scenarios: (i) outdoor to indoor
generalization, (ii) sparse-beam \& dense-beam adaptation, and (iii)
non-semantic to semantic transfer. Given different amounts of fine-tuning data,
our experiments show that a single pre-trained model can achieve up to 11%
absolute improvement (83\% relative) over training from scratch and outperforms
training from scratch in 30/36 of our comparisons. This transferability of
dynamic learning significantly reduces the reliance on manually annotated data
for semantic occupancy forecasting: our method exceed the previous semantic
occupancy forecasting models with only 5% of the labeled training data required
by prior models. We also observed inefficiencies of current LiDAR world models,
mainly through their under-compression of LiDAR data and inefficient training
objectives. To address this, we propose a latent conditional flow matching
(CFM)-based frameworks that achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy
using only half the training data and a compression ratio 6 times higher than
that of prior methods. Our model achieves SOTA performance on
future-trajectory-conditioned semantic occupancy forecasting while being 23x
more computationally efficient (a 28x FPS speedup); and achieves SOTA
performance on semantic occupancy forecasting while being 2x more
computationally efficient (a 1.1x FPS speedup).

Result: PathDiff在图像保真度、文本-图像对齐和真实性方面表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PathDiff为下游任务（如细胞核分割和分类）提供了有效的数据增强工具。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have shown promise in synthesizing
histopathology images to address data scarcity caused by privacy constraints.
Diagnostic text reports provide high-level semantic descriptions, and masks
offer fine-grained spatial structures essential for representing distinct
morphological regions. However, public datasets lack paired text and mask data
for the same histopathological images, limiting their joint use in image
generation. This constraint restricts the ability to fully exploit the benefits
of combining both modalities for enhanced control over semantics and spatial
details. To overcome this, we propose PathDiff, a diffusion framework that
effectively learns from unpaired mask-text data by integrating both modalities
into a unified conditioning space. PathDiff allows precise control over
structural and contextual features, generating high-quality, semantically
accurate images. PathDiff also improves image fidelity, text-image alignment,
and faithfulness, enhancing data augmentation for downstream tasks like nuclei
segmentation and classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate its
superiority over existing methods.

Motivation: 传统CAM方法在弱监督语义分割中存在部分激活和边界不精确的问题，而扩散模型生成的显著性图易受背景噪声干扰。

Method: 结合对比学习和扩散特征（CLDF），利用梯度图和CAM识别前景和背景像素，训练像素解码器生成低维嵌入空间。

Result: 在两个公共医学数据集的四个分割任务中，CLDF显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CLDF通过对比学习和扩散特征的结合，有效解决了弱监督语义分割中的噪声和边界问题。

Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods using class labels
often rely on class activation maps (CAMs) to localize objects. However,
traditional CAM-based methods struggle with partial activations and imprecise
object boundaries due to optimization discrepancies between classification and
segmentation. Recently, the conditional diffusion model (CDM) has been used as
an alternative for generating segmentation masks in WSSS, leveraging its strong
image generation capabilities tailored to specific class distributions. By
modifying or perturbing the condition during diffusion sampling, the related
objects can be highlighted in the generated images. Yet, the saliency maps
generated by CDMs are prone to noise from background alterations during reverse
diffusion. To alleviate the problem, we introduce Contrastive Learning with
Diffusion Features (CLDF), a novel method that uses contrastive learning to
train a pixel decoder to map the diffusion features from a frozen CDM to a
low-dimensional embedding space for segmentation. Specifically, we integrate
gradient maps generated from CDM external classifier with CAMs to identify
foreground and background pixels with fewer false positives/negatives for
contrastive learning, enabling robust pixel embedding learning. Experimental
results on four segmentation tasks from two public medical datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines.

Result: 实验表明，InDiTE-Diff在TAMP任务中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: InDiTE-Diff为时间变化图像修复提供了有效解决方案，并填补了相关数据集的空白。

Abstract: In this work, we focus on a novel and practical task, i.e., Time-vAriant
iMage inPainting (TAMP). The aim of TAMP is to restore a damaged target image
by leveraging the complementary information from a reference image, where both
images captured the same scene but with a significant time gap in between,
i.e., time-variant images. Different from conventional reference-guided image
inpainting, the reference image under TAMP setup presents significant content
distinction to the target image and potentially also suffers from damages. Such
an application frequently happens in our daily lives to restore a damaged image
by referring to another reference image, where there is no guarantee of the
reference image's source and quality. In particular, our study finds that even
state-of-the-art (SOTA) reference-guided image inpainting methods fail to
achieve plausible results due to the chaotic image complementation. To address
such an ill-posed problem, we propose a novel Interactive Distribution
Transition Estimation (InDiTE) module which interactively complements the
time-variant images with adaptive semantics thus facilitate the restoration of
damaged regions. To further boost the performance, we propose our TAMP
solution, namely Interactive Distribution Transition Estimation-driven
Diffusion (InDiTE-Diff), which integrates InDiTE with SOTA diffusion model and
conducts latent cross-reference during sampling. Moreover, considering the lack
of benchmarks for TAMP task, we newly assembled a dataset, i.e., TAMP-Street,
based on existing image and mask datasets. We conduct experiments on the
TAMP-Street datasets under two different time-variant image inpainting
settings, which show our method consistently outperform SOTA reference-guided
image inpainting methods for solving TAMP.

Conclusion: VLSR能高效优化制造业数据集标签质量，减少人工干预，提升模型训练效果。

Abstract: The success of machine learning models in industrial applications is heavily
dependent on the quality of the datasets used to train the models. However,
large-scale datasets, specially those constructed from crowd-sourcing and
web-scraping, often suffer from label noise, inconsistencies, and errors. This
problem is particularly pronounced in manufacturing domains, where obtaining
high-quality labels is costly and time-consuming. This paper introduces
Vision-Language Sanitization and Refinement (VLSR), which is a
vision-language-based framework for label sanitization and refinement in
multi-label manufacturing image datasets. This method embeds both images and
their associated textual labels into a shared semantic space leveraging the
CLIP vision-language model. Then two key tasks are addressed in this process by
computing the cosine similarity between embeddings. First, label sanitization
is performed to identify irrelevant, misspelled, or semantically weak labels,
and surface the most semantically aligned label for each image by comparing
image-label pairs using cosine similarity between image and label embeddings.
Second, the method applies density-based clustering on text embeddings,
followed by iterative cluster merging, to group semantically similar labels
into unified label groups. The Factorynet dataset, which includes noisy labels
from both human annotations and web-scraped sources, is employed to evaluate
the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Experimental results demonstrate
that the VLSR framework successfully identifies problematic labels and improves
label consistency. This method enables a significant reduction in label
vocabulary through clustering, which ultimately enhances the dataset's quality
for training robust machine learning models in industrial applications with
minimal human intervention.

Result: 在胸部X光数据集上实验表明，AdFair-CLIP显著提升公平性和诊断准确性，并在零样本和少样本场景中保持稳健。

Conclusion: AdFair-CLIP为基于CLIP的医学诊断模型设定了公平性学习的新基准，尤其在胸部X光分析中。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models have demonstrated
superior performance across various visual tasks including medical image
classification. However, fairness concerns, including demographic biases, have
received limited attention for CLIP models. This oversight leads to critical
issues, particularly those related to race and gender, resulting in disparities
in diagnostic outcomes and reduced reliability for underrepresented groups. To
address these challenges, we introduce AdFair-CLIP, a novel framework employing
adversarial feature intervention to suppress sensitive attributes, thereby
mitigating spurious correlations and improving prediction fairness. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on chest X-ray (CXR) datasets, and show that
AdFair-CLIP significantly enhances both fairness and diagnostic accuracy, while
maintaining robust generalization in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. These
results establish new benchmarks for fairness-aware learning in CLIP-based
medical diagnostic models, particularly for CXR analysis.

world model framework that enhances environmental understanding and
decision-making in VLN-CE tasks. NavMorph employs compact latent
representations to model environmental dynamics, equipping agents with
foresight for adaptive planning and policy refinement. By integrating a novel

*Pedro Alonso,Tianrui Li,Chongshou Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的度量GeoCD，用于解决Chamfer Distance（CD）在3D点云学习中无法捕捉内在几何形状的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chamfer Distance（CD）因其简单高效被广泛使用，但仅依赖欧氏距离，无法捕捉3D形状的内在几何特性。

Method: 提出GeoCD，一种拓扑感知且完全可微的测地距离近似方法，用于3D点云学习。

Result: 实验表明，GeoCD在不同架构和数据集上均显著提升了重建质量，仅需一个epoch的微调即可在多指标上取得显著提升。

Conclusion: GeoCD是一种有效的替代CD的度量方法，能够更好地捕捉3D形状的几何特性。

Abstract: Chamfer Distance (CD) is a widely adopted metric in 3D point cloud learning
due to its simplicity and efficiency. However, it suffers from a fundamental
limitation: it relies solely on Euclidean distances, which often fail to
capture the intrinsic geometry of 3D shapes. To address this limitation, we
propose GeoCD, a topology-aware and fully differentiable approximation of
geodesic distance designed to serve as a metric for 3D point cloud learning.
Our experiments show that GeoCD consistently improves reconstruction quality
over standard CD across various architectures and datasets. We demonstrate this
by fine-tuning several models, initially trained with standard CD, using GeoCD.
Remarkably, fine-tuning for a single epoch with GeoCD yields significant gains
across multiple evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于2D高斯泼溅的自适应图像表示框架，显著减少训练时间并动态调整高斯点数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决隐式神经表示（INR）的高GPU资源需求及高斯泼溅方法训练慢、适应性差的问题。

Method: 使用网络快速生成粗略高斯表示，并通过少量微调步骤优化，动态调整高斯点数量以适应图像复杂度。

Result: 在DIV2K和Kodak数据集上，渲染性能与GaussianImage相当或更优，训练时间减少一个数量级。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高质量渲染的同时，显著提升了效率和适应性。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has demonstrated remarkable advances in
the field of image representation but demands substantial GPU resources.
GaussianImage recently pioneered the use of Gaussian Splatting to mitigate this
cost, however, the slow training process limits its practicality, and the fixed
number of Gaussians per image limits its adaptability to varying information
entropy. To address these issues, we propose in this paper a generalizable and
self-adaptive image representation framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting.
Our method employs a network to quickly generate a coarse Gaussian
representation, followed by minimal fine-tuning steps, achieving comparable
rendering quality of GaussianImage while significantly reducing training time.
Moreover, our approach dynamically adjusts the number of Gaussian points based
on image complexity to further enhance flexibility and efficiency in practice.
Experiments on DIV2K and Kodak datasets show that our method matches or exceeds
GaussianImage's rendering performance with far fewer iterations and shorter
training times. Specifically, our method reduces the training time by up to one
order of magnitude while achieving superior rendering performance with the same
number of Gaussians.

Abstract: Objectives: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
has significantly enhanced their reasoning capabilities, enabling a wide range
of intelligent applications. However, these advancements also raise critical
concerns regarding privacy and ethics. MLLMs are now capable of inferring the
geographic location of images -- such as those shared on social media or
captured from street views -- based solely on visual content, thereby posing
serious risks of privacy invasion, including doxxing, surveillance, and other
security threats.
  Methods: This study provides a comprehensive analysis of existing geolocation
techniques based on MLLMs. It systematically reviews relevant litera-ture and
evaluates the performance of state-of-the-art visual reasoning models on
geolocation tasks, particularly in identifying the origins of street view
imagery.
  Results: Empirical evaluation reveals that the most advanced visual large
models can successfully localize the origin of street-level imagery with up to
$49\%$ accuracy within a 1-kilometer radius. This performance underscores the
models' powerful capacity to extract and utilize fine-grained geographic cues
from visual data.
  Conclusions: Building on these findings, the study identifies key visual
elements that contribute to suc-cessful geolocation, such as text,
architectural styles, and environmental features. Furthermore, it discusses the
potential privacy implications associated with MLLM-enabled geolocation and
discuss several technical and policy-based coun-termeasures to mitigate
associated risks. Our code and dataset are available at

Conclusion: MTADiffusion通过改进语义对齐、结构稳定性和风格一致性，显著提升了对象修复的效果。

Abstract: Advancements in generative models have enabled image inpainting models to
generate content within specific regions of an image based on provided prompts
and masks. However, existing inpainting methods often suffer from problems such
as semantic misalignment, structural distortion, and style inconsistency. In
this work, we present MTADiffusion, a Mask-Text Alignment diffusion model
designed for object inpainting. To enhance the semantic capabilities of the
inpainting model, we introduce MTAPipeline, an automatic solution for
annotating masks with detailed descriptions. Based on the MTAPipeline, we
construct a new MTADataset comprising 5 million images and 25 million mask-text
pairs. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task training strategy that integrates
both inpainting and edge prediction tasks to improve structural stability. To
promote style consistency, we present a novel inpainting style-consistency loss
using a pre-trained VGG network and the Gram matrix. Comprehensive evaluations
on BrushBench and EditBench demonstrate that MTADiffusion achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to other methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces Qwen-GUI-3B, a lightweight Vision-Language Model (VLM)
specifically designed for Graphical User Interface grounding tasks, achieving
performance competitive with significantly larger models. Unlike large-scale
VLMs (>7B parameters) that are computationally intensive and impractical for
consumer-grade hardware, Qwen-GUI-3B delivers strong grounding accuracy while
being fully trainable on a single GPU (RTX 4090). The model incorporates
several key innovations: (i) combine cross-platform, multi-resolution dataset
of 24K examples from diverse sources including mobile, desktop, and web GUI
screenshots to effectively address data scarcity in high-resolution desktop
environments; (ii) a two-stage fine-tuning strategy, where initial
cross-platform training establishes robust GUI understanding, followed by
specialized fine-tuning on high-resolution data to significantly enhance model
adaptability; and (iii) data curation and redundancy reduction strategies,
demonstrating that randomly sampling a smaller subset with reduced redundancy
achieves performance comparable to larger datasets, emphasizing data diversity
over sheer volume. Empirical evaluation on standard GUI grounding
benchmarks-including ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and the challenging
ScreenSpot-Pro, highlights Qwen-GUI-3B's exceptional accuracy, achieving 84.9%
on ScreenSpot and 86.4% on ScreenSpot-v2, surpassing prior models under 4B
parameters. Ablation studies validate the critical role of balanced sampling
and two-stage fine-tuning in enhancing robustness, particularly in
high-resolution desktop scenarios. The Qwen-GUI-3B is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过引入LLM增强的动作感知多模态提示调优方法，赋予CLIP细粒度动作级理解能力，从而提升图像-文本匹配任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在图像-文本匹配任务中表现优异，但缺乏对细粒度动作的理解能力，限制了其在描述物体状态或关系时的表现。

Method: 设计了动作三元组提示和动作状态提示，利用LLM生成的动作相关知识，并通过自适应交互模块聚合视觉特征。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过引入动作级理解，显著提升了CLIP在细粒度视觉-语言对齐任务中的性能。

Abstract: Driven by large-scale contrastive vision-language pre-trained models such as
CLIP, recent advancements in the image-text matching task have achieved
remarkable success in representation learning. Due to image-level
visual-language alignment, CLIP falls short in understanding fine-grained
details such as object attributes and spatial relationships between objects.
Recent efforts have attempted to compel CLIP to acquire structured visual
representations by introducing prompt learning to achieve object-level
alignment. While achieving promising results, they still lack the capability to
perceive actions, which are crucial for describing the states or relationships
between objects. Therefore, we propose to endow CLIP with fine-grained
action-level understanding by introducing an LLM-enhanced action-aware
multi-modal prompt-tuning method, incorporating the action-related external
knowledge generated by large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we design an
action triplet prompt and an action state prompt to exploit compositional
semantic knowledge and state-related causal knowledge implicitly stored in
LLMs. Subsequently, we propose an adaptive interaction module to aggregate
attentive visual features conditioned on action-aware prompted knowledge for
establishing discriminative and action-aware visual representations, which
further improves the performance. Comprehensive experimental results on two
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Underwater object detection is crucial for autonomous navigation,
environmental monitoring, and marine exploration, but it is severely hampered
by light attenuation, turbidity, and occlusion. Current methods balance
accuracy and computational efficiency, but they have trouble deploying in
real-time under low visibility conditions. Through the integration of
physics-informed augmentation techniques with the YOLOv12 architecture, this
study advances underwater detection. With Residual ELAN blocks to preserve
structural features in turbid waters and Area Attention to maintain large
receptive fields for occluded objects while reducing computational complexity.
Underwater optical properties are addressed by domain-specific augmentations
such as turbulence adaptive blurring, biologically grounded occlusion
simulation, and spectral HSV transformations for color distortion. Extensive
tests on four difficult datasets show state-of-the-art performance, with
Brackish data registering 98.30% mAP at 142 FPS. YOLOv12 improves occlusion
robustness by 18.9%, small-object recall by 22.4%, and detection precision by
up to 7.94% compared to previous models. The crucial role of augmentation
strategy is validated by ablation studies. This work offers a precise and
effective solution for conservation and underwater robotics applications.

Conclusion: 该方法通过利用预训练视角先验，显著提升了全景视频生成的质量。

Abstract: Panoramic video generation aims to synthesize 360-degree immersive videos,
holding significant importance in the fields of VR, world models, and spatial
intelligence. Existing works fail to synthesize high-quality panoramic videos
due to the inherent modality gap between panoramic data and perspective data,
which constitutes the majority of the training data for modern diffusion
models. In this paper, we propose a novel framework utilizing pretrained
perspective video models for generating panoramic videos. Specifically, we
design a novel panorama representation named ViewPoint map, which possesses
global spatial continuity and fine-grained visual details simultaneously. With
our proposed Pano-Perspective attention mechanism, the model benefits from
pretrained perspective priors and captures the panoramic spatial correlations
of the ViewPoint map effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method can synthesize highly dynamic and spatially consistent panoramic videos,
achieving state-of-the-art performance and surpassing previous methods.

Conclusion: 该方法具有广泛适用性，显著提升了扩散模型在视图一致性上的表现。

Abstract: Generating high-quality novel views of a scene from a single image requires
maintaining structural coherence across different views, referred to as view
consistency. While diffusion models have driven advancements in novel view
synthesis, they still struggle to preserve spatial continuity across views.
Diffusion models have been combined with 3D models to address the issue, but
such approaches lack efficiency due to their complex multi-step pipelines. This
paper proposes a novel view-consistent image generation method which utilizes
diffusion models without additional modules. Our key idea is to enhance
diffusion models with a training-free method that enables adaptive attention
manipulation and noise reinitialization by leveraging view-guided warping to
ensure view consistency. Through our comprehensive metric framework suitable
for novel-view datasets, we show that our method improves view consistency
across various diffusion models, demonstrating its broader applicability.

Abstract: The eye-tracking video saliency prediction (VSP) task and video salient
object detection (VSOD) task both focus on the most attractive objects in video
and show the result in the form of predictive heatmaps and pixel-level saliency
masks, respectively. In practical applications, eye tracker annotations are
more readily obtainable and align closely with the authentic visual patterns of
human eyes. Therefore, this paper aims to introduce fixation information to
assist the detection of video salient objects under weak supervision. On the
one hand, we ponder how to better explore and utilize the information provided
by fixation, and then propose a Position and Semantic Embedding (PSE) module to
provide location and semantic guidance during the feature learning process. On
the other hand, we achieve spatiotemporal feature modeling under weak
supervision from the aspects of feature selection and feature contrast. A
Semantics and Locality Query (SLQ) Competitor with semantic and locality
constraints is designed to effectively select the most matching and accurate
object query for spatiotemporal modeling. In addition, an Intra-Inter Mixed
Contrastive (IIMC) model improves the spatiotemporal modeling capabilities
under weak supervision by forming an intra-video and inter-video contrastive
learning paradigm. Experimental results on five popular VSOD benchmarks
indicate that our model outperforms other competitors on various evaluation
metrics.

Abstract: Traditional vision-based autonomous driving systems often face difficulties
in navigating complex environments when relying solely on single-image inputs.
To overcome this limitation, incorporating temporal data such as past image
frames or steering sequences, has proven effective in enhancing robustness and
adaptability in challenging scenarios. While previous high-performance methods
exist, they often rely on resource-intensive fusion networks, making them
impractical for training and unsuitable for federated learning. To address
these challenges, we propose lightweight temporal transformer decomposition, a
method that processes sequential image frames and temporal steering data by
breaking down large attention maps into smaller matrices. This approach reduces
model complexity, enabling efficient weight updates for convergence and
real-time predictions while leveraging temporal information to enhance
autonomous driving performance. Intensive experiments on three datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms recent approaches by a clear margin
while achieving real-time performance. Additionally, real robot experiments
further confirm the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Training on test-time data enables deep learning models to adapt to dynamic
environmental changes, enhancing their practical applicability. Online
adaptation from source to target domains is promising but it remains highly
reliant on the performance of source pretrained model. In this paper, we
investigate whether test-time adaptation (TTA) methods can continuously improve
models trained via self-supervised learning (SSL) without relying on source
pretraining. We introduce a self-supervised TTA protocol after observing that
existing TTA approaches struggle when directly applied to self-supervised
models with low accuracy on the source domain. Furthermore, we propose a
collaborative learning framework that integrates SSL and TTA models, leveraging
contrastive learning and knowledge distillation for stepwise representation
refinement. We validate our method on diverse self-supervised models, including
DINO, MoCo, and iBOT, across TTA benchmarks. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our approach in SSL, showing that it achieves competitive

Abstract: We introduce GVIT, a classification framework that abandons conventional
pixel or patch grid input representations in favor of a compact set of
learnable 2D Gaussians. Each image is encoded as a few hundred Gaussians whose
positions, scales, orientations, colors, and opacities are optimized jointly
with a ViT classifier trained on top of these representations. We reuse the
classifier gradients as constructive guidance, steering the Gaussians toward
class-salient regions while a differentiable renderer optimizes an image
reconstruction loss. We demonstrate that by 2D Gaussian input representations
coupled with our GVIT guidance, using a relatively standard ViT architecture,
closely matches the performance of a traditional patch-based ViT, reaching a
76.9% top-1 accuracy on Imagenet-1k using a ViT-B architecture.

Abstract: Congenital uterine anomalies (CUAs) can lead to infertility, miscarriage,
preterm birth, and an increased risk of pregnancy complications. Compared to
traditional 2D ultrasound (US), 3D US can reconstruct the coronal plane,
providing a clear visualization of the uterine morphology for assessing CUAs
accurately. In this paper, we propose an intelligent system for simultaneous
automated plane localization and CUA diagnosis. Our highlights are: 1) we
develop a denoising diffusion model with local (plane) and global (volume/text)
guidance, using an adaptive weighting strategy to optimize attention allocation
to different conditions; 2) we introduce a reinforcement learning-based
framework with unsupervised rewards to extract the key slice summary from
redundant sequences, fully integrating information across multiple planes to
reduce learning difficulty; 3) we provide text-driven uncertainty modeling for
coarse prediction, and leverage it to adjust the classification probability for
overall performance improvement. Extensive experiments on a large 3D uterine US

Conclusion: 该方法通过几何注意力驱动的图融合，显著提升了ToF深度去噪的时空一致性和清晰度。

Abstract: Depth images captured by Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors are prone to noise,
requiring denoising for reliable downstream applications. Previous works either
focus on single-frame processing, or perform multi-frame processing without
considering depth variations at corresponding pixels across frames, leading to
undesirable temporal inconsistency and spatial ambiguity. In this paper, we
propose a novel ToF depth denoising network leveraging motion-invariant graph
fusion to simultaneously enhance temporal stability and spatial sharpness.
Specifically, despite depth shifts across frames, graph structures exhibit
temporal self-similarity, enabling cross-frame geometric attention for graph
fusion. Then, by incorporating an image smoothness prior on the fused graph and
data fidelity term derived from ToF noise distribution, we formulate a maximum
a posterior problem for ToF denoising. Finally, the solution is unrolled into
iterative filters whose weights are adaptively learned from the graph-informed
geometric attention, producing a high-performance yet interpretable network.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves
state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and consistency on synthetic
DVToF dataset and exhibits robust generalization on the real Kinectv2 dataset.

### [235] [Pyramidal Patchification Flow for Visual Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23543)
*Hui Li,Baoyou Chen,Liwei Zhang,Jiaye Li,Jingdong Wang,Siyu Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PPFlow通过动态调整patch大小和线性投影，优化了DiT的计算成本，同时保持生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统DiT中固定patch大小导致的计算效率问题，提出动态调整patch大小以适应不同噪声水平的timesteps。

Method: 引入Pyramidal Patchification Flow (PPFlow)，动态调整patch大小，学习不同patch大小的线性投影，并修改Unpatchify。

Result: 训练从头开始可实现1.6倍（2.0倍）的推理速度提升，性能接近；从预训练DiT微调表现更优。

Conclusion: PPFlow有效提升计算效率，同时保持或提升生成性能，适用于不同训练方式。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers (DiTs) adopt Patchify, mapping patch representations
to token representations through linear projections, to adjust the number of
tokens input to DiT blocks and thus the computation cost. Instead of a single
patch size for all the timesteps, we introduce a Pyramidal Patchification Flow
(PPFlow) approach: Large patch sizes are used for high noise timesteps and
small patch sizes for low noise timesteps; Linear projections are learned for
each patch size; and Unpatchify is accordingly modified. Unlike Pyramidal Flow,
our approach operates over full latent representations other than pyramid
representations, and adopts the normal denoising process without requiring the
renoising trick. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through two
training manners. Training from scratch achieves a $1.6\times$ ($2.0\times$)
inference speed over SiT-B/2 for 2-level (3-level) pyramid patchification with
slightly lower training FLOPs and similar image generation performance.
Training from pretrained normal DiTs achieves even better performance with
small training time. The code and checkpoint are at

*Jiwon Kim,Soohyun Hwang,Dong-O Kim,Changsu Han,Min Kyu Park,Chang-Su Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Oneta的多风格图像增强算法，通过两步操作（强度增强和色彩校正）实现高性能，并支持多种风格任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多风格图像增强任务的需求，通过简单但高效的方法实现多种图像处理任务的统一处理。

Method: Oneta采用两步增强模型：强度增强（使用eigenTF）和色彩校正（使用CCM）。网络由Y-Net和C-Net组成，分别预测eigenTF和CCM参数，并通过K个可学习令牌支持多风格。

Result: 实验表明，Oneta能有效处理六种增强任务（如修图、低光增强等），并在30个数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: Oneta是一种简单但高效的多风格图像增强算法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: The first algorithm, called Oneta, for a novel task of multi-style image
enhancement is proposed in this work. Oneta uses two point operators
sequentially: intensity enhancement with a transformation function (TF) and
color correction with a color correction matrix (CCM). This two-step
enhancement model, though simple, achieves a high performance upper bound.
Also, we introduce eigentransformation function (eigenTF) to represent TF
compactly. The Oneta network comprises Y-Net and C-Net to predict eigenTF and
CCM parameters, respectively. To support $K$ styles, Oneta employs $K$
learnable tokens. During training, each style token is learned using image
pairs from the corresponding dataset. In testing, Oneta selects one of the $K$
style tokens to enhance an image accordingly. Extensive experiments show that
the single Oneta network can effectively undertake six enhancement tasks --
retouching, image signal processing, low-light image enhancement, dehazing,
underwater image enhancement, and white balancing -- across 30 datasets.

Motivation: 传统方法将面部运动合成和语音合成视为独立任务，忽略了它们之间的内在联系。JAM-Flow旨在通过统一框架解决这一问题。

Method: 采用流匹配和MM-DiT架构，结合Motion-DiT和Audio-DiT模块，通过选择性联合注意力层实现跨模态交互。

Result: JAM-Flow支持多种输入条件（如文本、参考音频和运动），实现了同步的面部运动和语音合成。

Conclusion: JAM-Flow为多模态生成建模提供了实用解决方案，显著提升了音频-视觉合成的整体性。

Abstract: The intrinsic link between facial motion and speech is often overlooked in
generative modeling, where talking head synthesis and text-to-speech (TTS) are
typically addressed as separate tasks. This paper introduces JAM-Flow, a
unified framework to simultaneously synthesize and condition on both facial
motion and speech. Our approach leverages flow matching and a novel Multi-Modal
Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) architecture, integrating specialized Motion-DiT
and Audio-DiT modules. These are coupled via selective joint attention layers
and incorporate key architectural choices, such as temporally aligned
positional embeddings and localized joint attention masking, to enable
effective cross-modal interaction while preserving modality-specific strengths.
Trained with an inpainting-style objective, JAM-Flow supports a wide array of
conditioning inputs-including text, reference audio, and reference
motion-facilitating tasks such as synchronized talking head generation from
text, audio-driven animation, and much more, within a single, coherent model.
JAM-Flow significantly advances multi-modal generative modeling by providing a
practical solution for holistic audio-visual synthesis. project page:

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LH2Face的新型损失函数，通过自适应边缘和代理约束优化人脸识别性能，在高质量难样本数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于余弦相似度和softmax分类的人脸识别方法在难样本上表现不佳，且未考虑人脸质量或识别难度，导致训练策略过于统一。

Method: 结合vMF分布的概率密度函数对数作为相似性度量，提出自适应边缘的多分类方法，并利用代理损失函数优化表示空间分布。

Result: 在IJB-B数据集上达到49.39%的准确率，优于第二名方法2.37%。

Conclusion: LH2Face通过自适应边缘和代理约束显著提升了高质量难样本的人脸识别性能。

Abstract: In current practical face authentication systems, most face recognition (FR)
algorithms are based on cosine similarity with softmax classification. Despite
its reliable classification performance, this method struggles with hard
samples. A popular strategy to improve FR performance is incorporating angular
or cosine margins. However, it does not take face quality or recognition
hardness into account, simply increasing the margin value and thus causing an
overly uniform training strategy. To address this problem, a novel loss
function is proposed, named Loss function for Hard High-quality Face (LH2Face).
Firstly, a similarity measure based on the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution
is stated, specifically focusing on the logarithm of the Probability Density
Function (PDF), which represents the distance between a probability
distribution and a vector. Then, an adaptive margin-based multi-classification
method using softmax, called the Uncertainty-Aware Margin Function, is
implemented in the article. Furthermore, proxy-based loss functions are used to
apply extra constraints between the proxy and sample to optimize their
representation space distribution. Finally, a renderer is constructed that
optimizes FR through face reconstruction and vice versa. Our LH2Face is
superior to similiar schemes on hard high-quality face datasets, achieving
49.39% accuracy on the IJB-B dataset, which surpasses the second-place method
by 2.37%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于物体中心辐射场（OcRF）的方法，通过增强3D体素特征和2D BEV特征，显著提升了多视角3D物体检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过深度估计或3D位置编码隐式地将2D特征转换为3D空间，限制了检测性能。作者假设辐射场可以增强3D几何估计能力，但直接使用会导致性能下降。

Method: 提出物体中心辐射场（OcRF），专注于前景物体建模，避免背景噪声；通过高度感知不透明度注意力（HOA）增强2D BEV特征。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，OcRFDet达到57.2% mAP和64.8% NDS，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OcRFDet通过结合OcRF和HOA，显著提升了3D物体检测性能，证明了物体中心辐射场的有效性。

Abstract: Current multi-view 3D object detection methods typically transfer 2D features
into 3D space using depth estimation or 3D position encoder, but in a fully
data-driven and implicit manner, which limits the detection performance.
Inspired by the success of radiance fields on 3D reconstruction, we assume they
can be used to enhance the detector's ability of 3D geometry estimation.
However, we observe a decline in detection performance, when we directly use
them for 3D rendering as an auxiliary task. From our analysis, we find the
performance drop is caused by the strong responses on the background when
rendering the whole scene. To address this problem, we propose object-centric
radiance fields, focusing on modeling foreground objects while discarding
background noises. Specifically, we employ Object-centric Radiance Fields
(OcRF) to enhance 3D voxel features via an auxiliary task of rendering
foreground objects. We further use opacity - the side-product of rendering- to
enhance the 2D foreground BEV features via Height-aware Opacity-based Attention
(HOA), where attention maps at different height levels are generated separately
via multiple networks in parallel. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes
validation and test datasets demonstrate that our OcRFDet achieves superior
performance, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods with 57.2$\%$ mAP
and 64.8$\%$ NDS on the nuScenes test benchmark. Code will be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MWT-Diff框架结合潜在扩散模型和小波变换，通过MWT-Encoder生成嵌入特征，逐步重建高分辨率卫星图像，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率卫星图像获取受限于传感器时空限制和高成本，影响环境监测等应用。

Method: 提出MWT-Diff框架，结合潜在扩散模型和小波变换，利用MWT-Encoder生成嵌入特征，指导分层扩散动态重建高分辨率图像。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，FID和LPIPS等感知质量指标验证了其优越性。

Conclusion: MWT-Diff能有效解决卫星图像超分辨率问题，保留关键空间特征，适用于详细遥感分析。

Abstract: The acquisition of high-resolution satellite imagery is often constrained by
the spatial and temporal limitations of satellite sensors, as well as the high
costs associated with frequent observations. These challenges hinder
applications such as environmental monitoring, disaster response, and
agricultural management, which require fine-grained and high-resolution data.
In this paper, we propose MWT-Diff, an innovative framework for satellite image
super-resolution (SR) that combines latent diffusion models with wavelet
transforms to address these challenges. At the core of the framework is a novel
metadata-, wavelet-, and time-aware encoder (MWT-Encoder), which generates
embeddings that capture metadata attributes, multi-scale frequency information,
and temporal relationships. The embedded feature representations steer the
hierarchical diffusion dynamics, through which the model progressively
reconstructs high-resolution satellite imagery from low-resolution inputs. This
process preserves critical spatial characteristics including textural patterns,
boundary discontinuities, and high-frequency spectral components essential for
detailed remote sensing analysis. The comparative analysis of MWT-Diff across
multiple datasets demonstrated favorable performance compared to recent
approaches, as measured by standard perceptual quality metrics including FID
and LPIPS.

Result: 实验表明EV-SpSegNet在EV-UAV数据集上表现优越，为小目标检测提供了新基准。

Conclusion: EV-UAV数据集和EV-SpSegNet为基于事件的小目标检测研究提供了重要资源和基线方法。

Abstract: Small object detection (SOD) in anti-UAV task is a challenging problem due to
the small size of UAVs and complex backgrounds. Traditional frame-based cameras
struggle to detect small objects in complex environments due to their low frame
rates, limited dynamic range, and data redundancy. Event cameras, with
microsecond temporal resolution and high dynamic range, provide a more
effective solution for SOD. However, existing event-based object detection
datasets are limited in scale, feature large targets size, and lack diverse
backgrounds, making them unsuitable for SOD benchmarks. In this paper, we
introduce a Event-based Small object detection (EVSOD) dataset (namely EV-UAV),
the first large-scale, highly diverse benchmark for anti-UAV tasks. It includes
147 sequences with over 2.3 million event-level annotations, featuring
extremely small targets (averaging 6.8 $\times$ 5.4 pixels) and diverse
scenarios such as urban clutter and extreme lighting conditions. Furthermore,
based on the observation that small moving targets form continuous curves in
spatiotemporal event point clouds, we propose Event based Sparse Segmentation
Network (EV-SpSegNet), a novel baseline for event segmentation in point cloud
space, along with a Spatiotemporal Correlation (STC) loss that leverages motion
continuity to guide the network in retaining target events. Extensive
experiments on the EV-UAV dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method and
provide a benchmark for future research in EVSOD. The dataset and code are at

Motivation: 解决CLIP模型在零样本工业异常检测中文本与图像特征对齐不足的问题，避免过拟合训练类别。

Method: 使用多类别名称堆叠生成堆叠提示，引入CSP模块构建通用提示，EFA模块训练知识特定线性层并自适应集成。

Result: 在七个工业异常检测数据集上实现零样本异常检测和分割任务的最优性能。

Conclusion: StackCLIP通过堆叠提示和模块化设计显著提升模型泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Enhancing the alignment between text and image features in the CLIP model is
a critical challenge in zero-shot industrial anomaly detection tasks. Recent
studies predominantly utilize specific category prompts during pretraining,
which can cause overfitting to the training categories and limit model
generalization. To address this, we propose a method that transforms category
names through multicategory name stacking to create stacked prompts, forming
the basis of our StackCLIP model. Our approach introduces two key components.
The Clustering-Driven Stacked Prompts (CSP) module constructs generic prompts
by stacking semantically analogous categories, while utilizing multi-object
textual feature fusion to amplify discriminative anomalies among similar
objects. The Ensemble Feature Alignment (EFA) module trains knowledge-specific
linear layers tailored for each stack cluster and adaptively integrates them
based on the attributes of test categories. These modules work together to
deliver superior training speed, stability, and convergence, significantly
boosting anomaly segmentation performance. Additionally, our stacked prompt
framework offers robust generalization across classification tasks. To further
improve performance, we introduce the Regulating Prompt Learning (RPL) module,
which leverages the generalization power of stacked prompts to refine prompt
learning, elevating results in anomaly detection classification tasks.
Extensive testing on seven industrial anomaly detection datasets demonstrates
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both zero-shot anomaly
detection and segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) condenses large datasets into compact yet
informative substitutes, preserving performance comparable to the original
dataset while reducing storage, transmission costs, and computational
consumption. However, previous DD methods mainly focus on distilling
information from images, often overlooking the semantic information inherent in
the data. The disregard for context hinders the model's generalization ability,
particularly in tasks involving complex datasets, which may result in illogical
outputs or the omission of critical objects. In this study, we integrate
vision-language methods into DD by introducing text prototypes to distill
language information and collaboratively synthesize data with image prototypes,
thereby enhancing dataset distillation performance. Notably, the text
prototypes utilized in this study are derived from descriptive text information
generated by an open-source large language model. This framework demonstrates
broad applicability across datasets without pre-existing text descriptions,
expanding the potential of dataset distillation beyond traditional image-based
approaches. Compared to other methods, the proposed approach generates
logically coherent images containing target objects, achieving state-of-the-art
validation performance and demonstrating robust generalization. Source code and
generated data are available in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标检测在安全敏感应用中至关重要，但易受物理可实现攻击（如对抗补丁和纹理）的威胁。现有对抗训练方法主要针对分类模型，对目标检测器的防御研究不足。

Method: 提出PBCAT方法，结合小区域梯度引导对抗补丁和全局不可察觉扰动，统一防御多种物理可实现攻击。

Result: 实验表明，PBCAT显著优于现有防御方法，对抗纹理攻击时检测准确率提升29.7%。

Conclusion: PBCAT为防御物理可实现攻击提供了有效解决方案，扩展了对抗训练的应用范围。

Abstract: Object detection plays a crucial role in many security-sensitive
applications. However, several recent studies have shown that object detectors
can be easily fooled by physically realizable attacks, \eg, adversarial patches
and recent adversarial textures, which pose realistic and urgent threats.
Adversarial Training (AT) has been recognized as the most effective defense
against adversarial attacks. While AT has been extensively studied in the
$l_\infty$ attack settings on classification models, AT against physically
realizable attacks on object detectors has received limited exploration. Early
attempts are only performed to defend against adversarial patches, leaving AT
against a wider range of physically realizable attacks under-explored. In this
work, we consider defending against various physically realizable attacks with
a unified AT method. We propose PBCAT, a novel Patch-Based Composite
Adversarial Training strategy. PBCAT optimizes the model by incorporating the
combination of small-area gradient-guided adversarial patches and imperceptible
global adversarial perturbations covering the entire image. With these designs,
PBCAT has the potential to defend against not only adversarial patches but also
unseen physically realizable attacks such as adversarial textures. Extensive
experiments in multiple settings demonstrated that PBCAT significantly improved
robustness against various physically realizable attacks over state-of-the-art
defense methods. Notably, it improved the detection accuracy by 29.7\% over
previous defense methods under one recent adversarial texture attack.

Motivation: LVLMs在解释视觉信息时经常产生与视觉内容不符的输出（幻觉现象），现有方法依赖昂贵的人工标注或增加推理时间。

Method: 利用LVLMs在回答标题查询时更强的视觉注意力，提出Caption-sensitive Attention Intervention (CAI)，通过干预注意力模式增强视觉感知能力。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，CAI在生成和判别任务上均达到SOTA性能，且仅需极少的额外推理成本。

Conclusion: CAI是一种高效且无需训练的幻觉缓解方法，显著提升了LVLMs的视觉感知能力。

Abstract: Although Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated powerful
capabilities in interpreting visual information, they frequently produce
content that deviates from visual information, leading to object hallucination.
To tackle this, recent works mostly depend on expensive manual annotations and
training cost, or significantly increase inference time. In this work, we
observe that LVLMs' attention to visual information is significantly stronger
when answering caption queries compared to non-caption queries. Inspired by
this phenomenon, we propose Caption-sensitive Attention Intervention (CAI), a
training-free, plug-and-play hallucination mitigation method that leverages the
attention activation pattern in response to caption queries to enhance LVLMs'
visual perception capability. Extensive experimental results across four
benchmarks covering both discriminative and generative tasks, demonstrate that
CAI achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) hallucination mitigating performance only
with minimal additional inference cost.

Abstract: Lecture slide element detection and retrieval are key problems in slide
understanding. Training effective models for these tasks often depends on
extensive manual annotation. However, annotating large volumes of lecture
slides for supervised training is labor intensive and requires domain
expertise. To address this, we propose a large language model (LLM)-guided
synthetic lecture slide generation pipeline, SynLecSlideGen, which produces
high-quality, coherent and realistic slides. We also create an evaluation
benchmark, namely RealSlide by manually annotating 1,050 real lecture slides.
To assess the utility of our synthetic slides, we perform few-shot transfer
learning on real data using models pre-trained on them. Experimental results
show that few-shot transfer learning with pretraining on synthetic slides
significantly improves performance compared to training only on real data. This
demonstrates that synthetic data can effectively compensate for limited labeled
lecture slides. The code and resources of our work are publicly available on

Abstract: Lidar point cloud synthesis based on generative models offers a promising
solution to augment deep learning pipelines, particularly when real-world data
is scarce or lacks diversity. By enabling flexible object manipulation, this
synthesis approach can significantly enrich training datasets and enhance
discriminative models. However, existing methods focus on unconditional lidar
point cloud generation, overlooking their potential for real-world
applications. In this paper, we propose SG-LDM, a Semantic-Guided Lidar
Diffusion Model that employs latent alignment to enable robust
semantic-to-lidar synthesis. By directly operating in the native lidar space
and leveraging explicit semantic conditioning, SG-LDM achieves state-of-the-art
performance in generating high-fidelity lidar point clouds guided by semantic
labels. Moreover, we propose the first diffusion-based lidar translation
framework based on SG-LDM, which enables cross-domain translation as a domain
adaptation strategy to enhance downstream perception performance. Systematic
experiments demonstrate that SG-LDM significantly outperforms existing lidar
diffusion models and the proposed lidar translation framework further improves
data augmentation performance in the downstream lidar segmentation task.

Abstract: Existing open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation methods typically supervise
3D segmentation models by merging text-aligned features (e.g., CLIP) extracted
from multi-view images onto 3D points. However, such approaches treat
multi-view images merely as intermediaries for transferring open-vocabulary
information, overlooking their rich semantic content and cross-view
correspondences, which limits model effectiveness. To address this, we propose
PGOV3D, a novel framework that introduces a Partial-to-Global curriculum for
improving open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation. The key innovation lies in
a two-stage training strategy. In the first stage, we pre-train the model on
partial scenes that provide dense semantic information but relatively simple
geometry. These partial point clouds are derived from multi-view RGB-D inputs
via pixel-wise depth projection. To enable open-vocabulary learning, we
leverage a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) and a 2D segmentation
foundation model to generate open-vocabulary labels for each viewpoint,
offering rich and aligned supervision. An auxiliary inter-frame consistency
module is introduced to enforce feature consistency across varying viewpoints
and enhance spatial understanding. In the second stage, we fine-tune the model
on complete scene-level point clouds, which are sparser and structurally more
complex. We aggregate the partial vocabularies associated with each scene and
generate pseudo labels using the pre-trained model, effectively bridging the
semantic gap between dense partial observations and large-scale 3D
environments. Extensive experiments on ScanNet, ScanNet200, and S3DIS
benchmarks demonstrate that PGOV3D achieves competitive performance in
open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation.

*Ziao Liu,Zhenjia Li,Yifeng Shi,Xiangang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttentionGS提出了一种新框架，通过结构注意力直接从随机初始化进行3D重建，解决了3DGS对高质量点云的依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS依赖SfM生成的高质量点云，在纹理缺失或视角受限的场景中表现不佳，限制了其应用范围。

Method: AttentionGS结合几何注意力和纹理注意力，早期恢复全局结构，后期优化细节，并使用不透明度加权梯度指导高斯密度化。

Result: 实验表明，AttentionGS在点云初始化不可靠的场景中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AttentionGS为3DGS在现实应用中提供了更鲁棒和灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a powerful alternative to Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF), excelling in complex scene reconstruction and efficient
rendering. However, it relies on high-quality point clouds from
Structure-from-Motion (SfM), limiting its applicability. SfM also fails in
texture-deficient or constrained-view scenarios, causing severe degradation in
3DGS reconstruction. To address this limitation, we propose AttentionGS, a
novel framework that eliminates the dependency on high-quality initial point
clouds by leveraging structural attention for direct 3D reconstruction from
randomly initialization. In the early training stage, we introduce geometric
attention to rapidly recover the global scene structure. As training
progresses, we incorporate texture attention to refine fine-grained details and
enhance rendering quality. Furthermore, we employ opacity-weighted gradients to
guide Gaussian densification, leading to improved surface reconstruction.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that
AttentionGS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in
scenarios where point cloud initialization is unreliable. Our approach paves
the way for more robust and flexible 3D Gaussian Splatting in real-world
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TurboVSR是一种超高效的基于扩散的视频超分辨率模型，通过高压缩比自动编码器和因子化条件设计，显著提升计算效率，同时保持与现有最佳方法相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的视频超分辨率模型在细节生成上表现优异，但计算效率低下，处理短视频耗时过长。

Method: 采用高压缩比自动编码器减少token数量；引入因子化条件设计降低训练复杂度；将预训练扩散模型转换为快捷模型以减少采样步骤。

Result: TurboVSR性能与现有最佳方法相当，但速度快100倍以上，处理2秒1080p视频仅需7秒，并支持4K图像超分辨率。

Conclusion: TurboVSR通过高效设计解决了计算效率问题，为更高分辨率的超分辨率任务提供了可能。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated exceptional promise in
the video super-resolution (VSR) task, achieving a substantial advancement in
detail generation relative to prior methods. However, these approaches face
significant computational efficiency challenges. For instance, current
techniques may require tens of minutes to super-resolve a mere 2-second, 1080p
video. In this paper, we present TurboVSR, an ultra-efficient diffusion-based
video super-resolution model. Our core design comprises three key aspects: (1)
We employ an autoencoder with a high compression ratio of 32$\times$32$\times$8
to reduce the number of tokens. (2) Highly compressed latents pose substantial
challenges for training. We introduce factorized conditioning to mitigate the
learning complexity: we first learn to super-resolve the initial frame;
subsequently, we condition the super-resolution of the remaining frames on the
high-resolution initial frame and the low-resolution subsequent frames. (3) We
convert the pre-trained diffusion model to a shortcut model to enable fewer
sampling steps, further accelerating inference. As a result, TurboVSR performs
on par with state-of-the-art VSR methods, while being 100+ times faster, taking
only 7 seconds to process a 2-second long 1080p video. TurboVSR also supports
image resolution by considering image as a one-frame video. Our efficient
design makes SR beyond 1080p possible, results on 4K (3648$\times$2048) image
SR show surprising fine details.

Motivation: 现有音频中心Transformer方法存在音频混合导致的感知模糊和视觉细节丢失问题，限制了分割性能。

Method: 提出VCT框架，利用视觉驱动的查询迭代获取音频和视觉信息，并引入PPQG模块生成语义丰富且视觉细节完整的查询。

Result: 在AVSBench数据集的三个子集上实现了新的最佳性能。

Conclusion: VCT框架有效解决了音频中心Transformer的局限性，提升了音频-视觉分割的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to segment sound-producing objects in
video frames based on the associated audio signal. Prevailing AVS methods
typically adopt an audio-centric Transformer architecture, where object queries
are derived from audio features. However, audio-centric Transformers suffer
from two limitations: perception ambiguity caused by the mixed nature of audio,
and weakened dense prediction ability due to visual detail loss. To address
these limitations, we propose a new Vision-Centric Transformer (VCT) framework
that leverages vision-derived queries to iteratively fetch corresponding audio
and visual information, enabling queries to better distinguish between
different sounding objects from mixed audio and accurately delineate their
contours. Additionally, we also introduce a Prototype Prompted Query Generation
(PPQG) module within our VCT framework to generate vision-derived queries that
are both semantically aware and visually rich through audio prototype prompting
and pixel context grouping, facilitating audio-visual information aggregation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VCT framework achieves new
state-of-the-art performances on three subsets of the AVSBench dataset. The
code is available at https://github.com/spyflying/VCT_AVS.

Abstract: Brain plays a crucial role in regulating body functions and cognitive
processes, with brain tumors posing significant risks to human health. Precise
and prompt detection is a key factor in proper treatment and better patient
outcomes. Traditional methods for detecting brain tumors, that include
biopsies, MRI, and CT scans often face challenges due to their high costs and
the need for specialized medical expertise. Recent developments in machine
learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) has exhibited strong capabilities in
automating the identification and categorization of brain tumors from medical
images, especially MRI scans. However, these classical ML models have
limitations, such as high computational demands, the need for large datasets,
and long training times, which hinder their accessibility and efficiency. Our
research uses MobileNET model for efficient detection of these tumors. The
novelty of this project lies in building an accurate tumor detection model
which use less computing re-sources and runs in less time followed by efficient
decision making through the use of image processing technique for accurate
results. The suggested method attained an average accuracy of 98.5%.

Result: 实验表明扩散模型具有创造性融合能力，但不同方法在不同条件下表现各异。

Conclusion: 扩散模型具有显著的组合潜力，但对输入变化敏感。

Abstract: Diffusion models have dramatically advanced text-to-image generation in
recent years, translating abstract concepts into high-fidelity images with
remarkable ease. In this work, we examine whether they can also blend distinct
concepts, ranging from concrete objects to intangible ideas, into coherent new
visual entities under a zero-shot framework. Specifically, concept blending
merges the key attributes of multiple concepts (expressed as textual prompts)
into a single, novel image that captures the essence of each concept. We
investigate four blending methods, each exploiting different aspects of the
diffusion pipeline (e.g., prompt scheduling, embedding interpolation, or
layer-wise conditioning). Through systematic experimentation across diverse
concept categories, such as merging concrete concepts, synthesizing compound
words, transferring artistic styles, and blending architectural landmarks, we
show that modern diffusion models indeed exhibit creative blending capabilities
without further training or fine-tuning. Our extensive user study, involving
100 participants, reveals that no single approach dominates in all scenarios:
each blending technique excels under certain conditions, with factors like
prompt ordering, conceptual distance, and random seed affecting the outcome.
These findings highlight the remarkable compositional potential of diffusion
models while exposing their sensitivity to seemingly minor input variations.

Conclusion: 通过统一视觉与文本表示，推动了更高效多模态基础模型的发展。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
vision-language understanding, yet effectively aligning different modalities
remains a fundamental challenge. We present a framework that unifies multimodal
understanding by applying byte-pair encoding to visual tokens. Unlike
conventional approaches that rely on modality-specific encoders, our method
directly incorporates structural information into visual tokens, mirroring
successful tokenization strategies in text-only language models. We introduce a
priority-guided encoding scheme that considers both frequency and spatial
consistency, coupled with a multi-stage training procedure based on
curriculum-driven data composition. These enhancements enable the transformer
model to better capture cross-modal relationships and reason with visual
information. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate improved performance across
diverse vision-language tasks. By bridging the gap between visual and textual
representations, our approach contributes to the advancement of more capable
and efficient multimodal foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像生成需要丰富的属性信息，但详细描述往往不可得，因此探索如何利用外部知识弥补这一不足。

Method: 设计提示链从MLLMs中获取描述，提出原型条件机制以增强生成器对未见描述的鲁棒性。

Result: 在四种数据集上的实验验证了VAP-Diffusion的有效性。

Conclusion: VAP-Diffusion通过外部知识和创新机制，显著提升了医学图像生成的多样性和质量。

Abstract: As the appearance of medical images is influenced by multiple underlying
factors, generative models require rich attribute information beyond labels to
produce realistic and diverse images. For instance, generating an image of skin
lesion with specific patterns demands descriptions that go beyond diagnosis,
such as shape, size, texture, and color. However, such detailed descriptions
are not always accessible. To address this, we explore a framework, termed
Visual Attribute Prompts (VAP)-Diffusion, to leverage external knowledge from
pre-trained Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to improve the quality
and diversity of medical image generation. First, to derive descriptions from
MLLMs without hallucination, we design a series of prompts following
Chain-of-Thoughts for common medical imaging tasks, including dermatologic,
colorectal, and chest X-ray images. Generated descriptions are utilized during
training and stored across different categories. During testing, descriptions
are randomly retrieved from the corresponding category for inference. Moreover,
to make the generator robust to unseen combination of descriptions at the test
time, we propose a Prototype Condition Mechanism that restricts test embeddings
to be similar to those from training. Experiments on three common types of
medical imaging across four datasets verify the effectiveness of VAP-Diffusion.

Conclusion: MReg模型在MR诊断中表现出色，代码已开源。

Abstract: Color Doppler echocardiography is a crucial tool for diagnosing mitral
regurgitation (MR). Recent studies have explored intelligent methods for MR
diagnosis to minimize user dependence and improve accuracy. However, these
approaches often fail to align with clinical workflow and may lead to
suboptimal accuracy and interpretability. In this study, we introduce an
automated MR diagnosis model (MReg) developed on the 4-chamber cardiac color
Doppler echocardiography video (A4C-CDV). It follows comprehensive feature
mining strategies to detect MR and assess its severity, considering clinical
realities. Our contribution is threefold. First, we formulate the MR diagnosis
as a regression task to capture the continuity and ordinal relationships
between categories. Second, we design a feature selection and amplification
mechanism to imitate the sonographer's diagnostic logic for accurate MR
grading. Third, inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts concept, we introduce a
feature summary module to extract the category-level features, enhancing the
representational capacity for more accurate grading. We trained and evaluated
our proposed MReg on a large in-house A4C-CDV dataset comprising 1868 cases
with three graded regurgitation labels. Compared to other weakly supervised
video anomaly detection and supervised classification methods, MReg
demonstrated superior performance in MR diagnosis. Our code is available at:

Abstract: In real-world vision-language applications, practitioners increasingly rely
on large, pretrained foundation models rather than custom-built solutions,
despite limited transparency regarding their training data and processes. While
these models achieve impressive performance on general benchmarks, their
effectiveness can decline notably under specialized domain shifts, such as
unique imaging conditions or environmental variations. In this work, we
introduce Deepbench, a framework designed to assess domain-specific robustness
of vision-language models (VLMs). Deepbench leverages a large language model
(LLM) to generate realistic, context-aware image corruptions tailored to
specific deployment domains without requiring labeled data. We evaluate a range
of contrastive vision-language architectures and architectural variants across
six real-world domains and observe substantial variability in robustness,
highlighting the need for targeted, domain-aware evaluation. Deepbench is
released as open-source software to support further research into domain-aware
robustness assessment.

Motivation: 解决现有数据剪枝方法依赖梯度和代理模型导致的高计算成本问题。

Method: 基于浅层特征评估样本重要性，动态剪枝并仅保留重要样本进行后续计算，引入概率密度作为重要性指标。

Result: 在ImageNet上，剪枝40%数据时，准确率提升0.5%，训练时间减少33%。

Conclusion: PFB在性能和速度上均显著优于现有方法，且无需额外计算开销。

Abstract: The ever-growing size of training datasets enhances the generalization
capability of modern machine learning models but also incurs exorbitant
computational costs. Existing data pruning approaches aim to accelerate
training by removing those less important samples. However, they often rely on
gradients or proxy models, leading to prohibitive additional costs of gradient
back-propagation and proxy model training. In this paper, we propose Partial
Forward Blocking (PFB), a novel framework for lossless training acceleration.
The efficiency of PFB stems from its unique adaptive pruning pipeline: sample
importance is assessed based on features extracted from the shallow layers of
the target model. Less important samples are then pruned, allowing only the
retained ones to proceed with the subsequent forward pass and loss
back-propagation. This mechanism significantly reduces the computational
overhead of deep-layer forward passes and back-propagation for pruned samples,
while also eliminating the need for auxiliary backward computations and proxy
model training. Moreover, PFB introduces probability density as an indicator of
sample importance. Combined with an adaptive distribution estimation module,
our method dynamically prioritizes relatively rare samples, aligning with the
constantly evolving training state. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
significant superiority of PFB in performance and speed. On ImageNet, PFB
achieves a 0.5% accuracy improvement and 33% training time reduction with 40%
data pruned.

Motivation: 解决Vision Transformer在资源受限硬件上计算成本高的问题，以及传统剪枝方法在未见数据域上权重评估不准确的问题。

Method: 提出P3B方法，利用块级相对贡献全局分配参数资源，识别低影响组件并保留关键部分。

Result: P3B在高稀疏性（70%参数减少）下仅损失0.64%准确率，在迁移学习任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: P3B是一种先进的剪枝方法，特别适用于资源受限场景和迁移学习任务。

Abstract: Vision Transformer have set new benchmarks in several tasks, but these models
come with the lack of high computational costs which makes them impractical for
resource limited hardware. Network pruning reduces the computational complexity
by removing less important operations while maintaining performance. However,
pruning a model on an unseen data domain, leads to a misevaluation of weight
significance, resulting in suboptimal resource assignment. In this work, we
find that task-sensitive layers initially fail to improve the feature
representation on downstream tasks, leading to performance loss for early
pruning decisions. To address this problem, we introduce Pruning by Block
Benefit (P3B), a pruning method that utilizes the relative contribution on
block level to globally assign parameter resources. P3B identifies low-impact
components to reduce parameter allocation while preserving critical ones.
Classical pruning mask optimization struggles to reactivate zero-mask-elements.
In contrast, P3B sets a layerwise keep ratio based on global performance
metrics, ensuring the reactivation of late-converging blocks. We show in
extensive experiments that P3B is a state of the art pruning method with most
noticeable gains in transfer learning tasks. Notably, P3B is able to conserve
high performance, even in high sparsity regimes of 70% parameter reduction
while only losing 0.64% in accuracy.

Abstract: Due to their powerful image generation capabilities, diffusion-based
adversarial example generation methods through image editing are rapidly
gaining popularity. However, due to reliance on the discriminative capability
of the diffusion model, these diffusion-based methods often struggle to
generalize beyond conventional image classification tasks, such as in Deepfake
detection. Moreover, traditional strategies for enhancing adversarial example
transferability are challenging to adapt to these methods. To address these
challenges, we propose a unified framework that seamlessly incorporates
traditional transferability enhancement strategies into diffusion model-based
adversarial example generation via image editing, enabling their application
across a wider range of downstream tasks. Our method won first place in the
"1st Adversarial Attacks on Deepfake Detectors: A Challenge in the Era of
AI-Generated Media" competition at ACM MM25, which validates the effectiveness
of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在视频运动定制中往往仅关注语义对齐或视觉表示，导致忽视运动的视觉复杂性或语义混淆。SynMotion旨在同时利用语义和视觉信息，提升运动保真度和时间一致性。

Conclusion: SynMotion通过联合语义和视觉优化，实现了高质量的运动定制视频生成。

Abstract: Diffusion-based video motion customization facilitates the acquisition of
human motion representations from a few video samples, while achieving
arbitrary subjects transfer through precise textual conditioning. Existing
approaches often rely on semantic-level alignment, expecting the model to learn
new motion concepts and combine them with other entities (e.g., ''cats'' or
''dogs'') to produce visually appealing results. However, video data involve
complex spatio-temporal patterns, and focusing solely on semantics cause the
model to overlook the visual complexity of motion. Conversely, tuning only the
visual representation leads to semantic confusion in representing the intended
action. To address these limitations, we propose SynMotion, a new
motion-customized video generation model that jointly leverages semantic
guidance and visual adaptation. At the semantic level, we introduce the
dual-embedding semantic comprehension mechanism which disentangles subject and
motion representations, allowing the model to learn customized motion features
while preserving its generative capabilities for diverse subjects. At the
visual level, we integrate parameter-efficient motion adapters into a
pre-trained video generation model to enhance motion fidelity and temporal
coherence. Furthermore, we introduce a new embedding-specific training strategy
which \textbf{alternately optimizes} subject and motion embeddings, supported
by the manually constructed Subject Prior Video (SPV) training dataset. This
strategy promotes motion specificity while preserving generalization across
diverse subjects. Lastly, we introduce MotionBench, a newly curated benchmark
with diverse motion patterns. Experimental results across both T2V and I2V
settings demonstrate that \method outperforms existing baselines. Project page:

Motivation: 现有测试时适应技术依赖大数据集，不适用于医学场景中的单患者实时推理，且未能充分利用医学影像的体数据。

Result: 在三个公开的乳腺MRI数据集上验证，性能接近监督基准，平均Dice相似系数提升3.75%。

Conclusion: 方法在医学影像分割中表现优异，代码已公开，易于集成到nnUNet框架。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation enables a trained model to adjust to a new domain during
inference, making it particularly valuable in clinical settings where such
on-the-fly adaptation is required. However, existing techniques depend on large
target domain datasets, which are often impractical and unavailable in medical
scenarios that demand per-patient, real-time inference. Moreover, current
methods commonly focus on two-dimensional images, failing to leverage the
volumetric richness of medical imaging data. Bridging this gap, we propose a
Patch-Based Multi-View Co-Training method for Single Image Test-Time
adaptation. Our method enforces feature and prediction consistency through
uncertainty-guided self-training, enabling effective volumetric segmentation in
the target domain with only a single test-time image. Validated on three
publicly available breast magnetic resonance imaging datasets for tumor
segmentation, our method achieves performance close to the upper bound
supervised benchmark while also outperforming all existing state-of-the-art
methods, on average by a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 3.75%. We publicly
share our accessible codebase, readily integrable with the popular nnUNet

*Haoyang Chen,Dongfang Sun,Caoyuan Ma,Shiqin Wang,Kewei Zhang,Zheng Wang,Zhixiang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Subjective Camera 是一种通过结合语言描述和渐进草图重建真实场景的方法，解决了语言模糊性和草图抽象性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在用户主观输入偏差、草图与3D先验之间的模态鸿沟以及草图质量敏感性问题，需要资源密集型调整或不切实际的草图精度要求。

Method: 通过概念顺序生成，建立外观先验并实现顺序感知的解耦生成，利用潜在优化桥接模态鸿沟，采用分层奖励引导框架处理粗糙草图。

Result: 在多样数据集上评估表明，该方法在语义和空间一致性上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Subjective Camera 提供了一种无需训练调整的方式，有效解决了现有挑战，实现了高质量的场景重建。

Abstract: We propose Subjective Camera, a human-as-imaging-device paradigm that
reconstructs real-world scenes from mental impressions through synergistic use
of verbal descriptions and progressive rough sketches. This approach overcomes
dual limitations of language ambiguity and sketch abstraction by treating the
user's drawing sequence as priors, effectively translating subjective
perceptual expectations into photorealistic images.
  Existing approaches face three fundamental barriers: (1) user-specific
subjective input biases, (2) huge modality gap between planar sketch and 3D
priors in diffusion, and (3) sketch quality-sensitive performance degradation.
Current solutions either demand resource-intensive model adaptation or impose
impractical requirements on sketch precision.
  Our framework addresses these challenges through concept-sequential
generation. (1) We establish robust appearance priors through text-reward
optimization, and then implement sequence-aware disentangled generation that
processes concepts in sketching order; these steps accommodate user-specific
subjective expectation in a train-free way. (2) We employ latent optimization
that effectively bridges the modality gap between planar sketches and 3D priors
in diffusion. (3) Our hierarchical reward-guided framework enables the use of
rough sketches without demanding artistic expertise. Comprehensive evaluation
across diverse datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance in maintaining both semantic and spatial
coherence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COCA提出了一种跨模型协同学习的TTA框架，通过互补知识和自我适应提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究跨模型知识如何影响测试时适应（TTA）过程，发现模型间互补知识可提升性能。

Method: 提出COCA框架，包含协同适应（整合互补知识）和自我适应（增强模型独特性）。

Result: COCA显著提升多种模型（如ViT、Mobile-ViT）在ImageNet-C上的性能，例如ViT-Base准确率从51.7%提升至64.5%。

Conclusion: COCA作为即插即用模块，有效提升TTA性能，展示了跨模型协同学习的潜力。

Abstract: Test-time Adaptation (TTA) adapts a given model to testing domain data with
potential domain shifts through online unsupervised learning, yielding
impressive performance. However, to date, existing TTA methods primarily focus
on single-model adaptation. In this work, we investigate an intriguing
question: how does cross-model knowledge influence the TTA process? Our
findings reveal that, in TTA's unsupervised online setting, each model can
provide complementary, confident knowledge to the others, even when there are
substantial differences in model size. For instance, a smaller model like
MobileViT (10.6M parameters) can effectively guide a larger model like ViT-Base
(86.6M parameters). In light of this, we propose COCA, a Cross-Model
Co-Learning framework for TTA, which mainly consists of two main strategies. 1)
Co-adaptation adaptively integrates complementary knowledge from other models
throughout the TTA process, reducing individual model biases. 2)
Self-adaptation enhances each model's unique strengths via unsupervised
learning, enabling diverse adaptation to the target domain. Extensive
experiments show that COCA, which can also serve as a plug-and-play module,
significantly boosts existing SOTAs, on models with various sizes--including
ResNets, ViTs, and Mobile-ViTs--via cross-model co-learned TTA. For example,
with Mobile-ViT's guidance, COCA raises ViT-Base's average adaptation accuracy
on ImageNet-C from 51.7% to 64.5%. The code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频身份定制任务面临身份一致性和运动自然性的挑战，现有方法难以同时满足这两点。

Method: 提出多模态身份融合模块（MIF）、时间感知身份注入机制（TAII）和自适应运动学习策略（AML），并结合高质量数据集Proteus-Bench。

Result: Proteus-ID在身份保持、文本对齐和运动质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Proteus-ID为视频身份定制设立了新基准，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Video identity customization seeks to synthesize realistic, temporally
coherent videos of a specific subject, given a single reference image and a
text prompt. This task presents two core challenges: (1) maintaining identity
consistency while aligning with the described appearance and actions, and (2)
generating natural, fluid motion without unrealistic stiffness. To address
these challenges, we introduce Proteus-ID, a novel diffusion-based framework
for identity-consistent and motion-coherent video customization. First, we
propose a Multimodal Identity Fusion (MIF) module that unifies visual and
textual cues into a joint identity representation using a Q-Former, providing
coherent guidance to the diffusion model and eliminating modality imbalance.
Second, we present a Time-Aware Identity Injection (TAII) mechanism that
dynamically modulates identity conditioning across denoising steps, improving
fine-detail reconstruction. Third, we propose Adaptive Motion Learning (AML), a
self-supervised strategy that reweights the training loss based on
optical-flow-derived motion heatmaps, enhancing motion realism without
requiring additional inputs. To support this task, we construct Proteus-Bench,
a high-quality dataset comprising 200K curated clips for training and 150
individuals from diverse professions and ethnicities for evaluation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Proteus-ID outperforms prior methods in identity
preservation, text alignment, and motion quality, establishing a new benchmark
for video identity customization. Codes and data are publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文通过合成数据挑战开放词汇目标检测器，发现其局限性和系统性失败模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放词汇目标检测器在安全关键应用中存在局限性，但真实数据难以系统评估其泛化能力，因此需要合成数据。

Method: 设计两个自动化流程，使用稳定扩散技术生成高多样性语义的合成数据，并在合成数据上评估多种检测器。

Result: 合成数据能挑战检测器，使其忽略物体；开放词汇模型更依赖物体位置而非语义。

Conclusion: 合成数据为挑战和改进开放词汇模型提供了系统性方法。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detectors such as Grounding DINO are trained on vast
and diverse data, achieving remarkable performance on challenging datasets. Due
to that, it is unclear where to find their limitations, which is of major
concern when using in safety-critical applications. Real-world data does not
provide sufficient control, required for a rigorous evaluation of model
generalization. In contrast, synthetically generated data allows to
systematically explore the boundaries of model competence/generalization. In
this work, we address two research questions: 1) Can we challenge
open-vocabulary object detectors with generated image content? 2) Can we find
systematic failure modes of those models? To address these questions, we design
two automated pipelines using stable diffusion to inpaint unusual objects with
high diversity in semantics, by sampling multiple substantives from WordNet and
ChatGPT. On the synthetically generated data, we evaluate and compare multiple
open-vocabulary object detectors as well as a classical object detector. The
synthetic data is derived from two real-world datasets, namely LostAndFound, a
challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) detection benchmark, and the NuImages
dataset. Our results indicate that inpainting can challenge open-vocabulary
object detectors in terms of overlooking objects. Additionally, we find a
strong dependence of open-vocabulary models on object location, rather than on
object semantics. This provides a systematic approach to challenge
open-vocabulary models and gives valuable insights on how data could be
acquired to effectively improve these models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于线性复杂度Vision Mamba网络的高效RGB-Event对象跟踪框架Mamba-FETrack V2，通过轻量级Prompt Generator和FEMamba主干实现跨模态特征提取与融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨模态跟踪算法依赖高复杂度Vision Transformer架构，导致计算开销大且跨模态交互效果有限。

Method: 设计轻量级Prompt Generator生成模态特定提示向量，结合Vision Mamba-based FEMamba主干进行特征提取与融合。

Result: 在多个RGB-Event跟踪基准测试中表现优越，包括短期的COESOT和长期的FE108、FELT V2数据集。

Conclusion: Mamba-FETrack V2框架在性能和效率上均优于现有方法，代码和模型将开源。

Abstract: Combining traditional RGB cameras with bio-inspired event cameras for robust
object tracking has garnered increasing attention in recent years. However,
most existing multimodal tracking algorithms depend heavily on high-complexity
Vision Transformer architectures for feature extraction and fusion across
modalities. This not only leads to substantial computational overhead but also
limits the effectiveness of cross-modal interactions. In this paper, we propose
an efficient RGB-Event object tracking framework based on the linear-complexity
Vision Mamba network, termed Mamba-FETrack V2. Specifically, we first design a
lightweight Prompt Generator that utilizes embedded features from each
modality, together with a shared prompt pool, to dynamically generate
modality-specific learnable prompt vectors. These prompts, along with the
modality-specific embedded features, are then fed into a Vision Mamba-based
FEMamba backbone, which facilitates prompt-guided feature extraction,
cross-modal interaction, and fusion in a unified manner. Finally, the fused
representations are passed to the tracking head for accurate target
localization. Extensive experimental evaluations on multiple RGB-Event tracking
benchmarks, including short-term COESOT dataset and long-term datasets, i.e.,
FE108 and FELT V2, demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of the
proposed tracking framework. The source code and pre-trained models will be
released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/Mamba_FETrack

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决罕见类别难以用文本描述且预训练数据中几乎不存在的问题，同时保持OVLM的预训练能力。

Method: 利用多尺度文本化块和多阶段融合策略，将视觉示例信息转化为文本化视觉标记，与文本提示共同指导OVLM。

Result: 在开放集数据集和少样本基准测试（PASCAL VOC和MSCOCO）上表现优异，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: VisTex-OVLM在保持OVLM架构和泛化能力的同时，显著提升了少样本场景下的性能。

Abstract: We propose VisTex-OVLM, a novel image prompted object detection method that
introduces visual textualization -- a process that projects a few visual
exemplars into the text feature space to enhance Object-level Vision-Language
Models' (OVLMs) capability in detecting rare categories that are difficult to
describe textually and nearly absent from their pre-training data, while
preserving their pre-trained object-text alignment. Specifically, VisTex-OVLM
leverages multi-scale textualizing blocks and a multi-stage fusion strategy to
integrate visual information from visual exemplars, generating textualized
visual tokens that effectively guide OVLMs alongside text prompts. Unlike
previous methods, our method maintains the original architecture of OVLM,
maintaining its generalization capabilities while enhancing performance in
few-shot settings. VisTex-OVLM demonstrates superior performance across
open-set datasets which have minimal overlap with OVLM's pre-training data and
achieves state-of-the-art results on few-shot benchmarks PASCAL VOC and MSCOCO.
The code will be released at https://github.com/WitGotFlg/VisTex-OVLM.

TL;DR: CRefDiff是一种基于扩散模型的可控参考超分辨率方法，通过双分支融合机制和预训练的Stable Diffusion模型，解决了现有RefSR方法在真实遥感图像中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RefSR方法在真实复杂场景（如跨传感器分辨率差异和地物变化）中表现不佳，存在欠生成或过度依赖参考图像的问题。

Method: 基于预训练的Stable Diffusion模型，引入双分支融合机制自适应整合参考图像的局部和全局信息，并提出Better Start策略加速推理。

Result: 在Real-RefRSSRD数据集上，CRefDiff在多项指标上达到最优，并提升了场景分类和语义分割等下游任务性能。

Conclusion: CRefDiff通过可控的参考融合和高效推理，显著提升了真实遥感图像超分辨率的性能和应用灵活性。

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) techniques can enhance the spatial resolution of remote
sensing images by utilizing low-resolution (LR) images to reconstruct
high-resolution (HR) images, enabling more efficient large-scale earth
observation applications. While single-image super-resolution (SISR) methods
have shown progress, reference-based super-resolution (RefSR) offers superior
performance by incorporating historical HR images alongside current LR
observations. However, existing RefSR methods struggle with real-world
complexities, such as cross-sensor resolution gap and significant land cover
changes, often leading to under-generation or over-reliance on reference image.
To address these challenges, we propose CRefDiff, a novel controllable
reference-based diffusion model for real-world remote sensing image SR. To
address the under-generation problem, CRefDiff is built upon the pretrained
Stable Diffusion model, leveraging its powerful generative prior to produce
accurate structures and textures. To mitigate over-reliance on the reference,
we introduce a dual-branch fusion mechanism that adaptively integrates both
local and global information from the reference image. Moreover, this novel
dual-branch design enables reference strength control during inference,
enhancing interactivity and flexibility of the model. Finally, a strategy named
Better Start is proposed to significantly reduce the number of denoising steps,
thereby accelerating the inference process. To support further research, we
introduce Real-RefRSSRD, a new real-world RefSR dataset for remote sensing
images, consisting of HR NAIP and LR Sentinel-2 image pairs with diverse land
cover changes and significant temporal gaps. Extensive experiments on
Real-RefRSSRD show that CRefDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance across
various metrics and improves downstream tasks such as scene classification and
semantic segmentation.

### [271] [Towards Initialization-free Calibrated Bundle Adjustment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23808)
*Carl Olsson,Amanda Nilsson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用已知相机标定的方法，通过引入成对相对旋转估计，实现近度量重建，解决了传统初始化自由BA方法因投影不变性导致的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统初始化自由BA方法因投影不变性无法利用相机标定信息，导致重建结果仅能确定到投影变换，且需要更多数据。本文旨在解决这一问题，实现近度量重建。

Method: 引入成对相对旋转估计，这些估计仅对相似变换不变，从而保留场景的度量特征。将旋转平均集成到pOSE框架中，实现初始化自由校准SfM。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能够可靠优化目标函数，从随机初始解高概率收敛到全局最小值，实现准确的近度量重建。

Conclusion: 该方法成功利用相机标定信息，实现了初始化自由且近度量的重建，为校准SfM提供了新思路。

Abstract: A recent series of works has shown that initialization-free BA can be
achieved using pseudo Object Space Error (pOSE) as a surrogate objective. The
initial reconstruction-step optimizes an objective where all terms are
projectively invariant and it cannot incorporate knowledge of the camera
calibration. As a result, the solution is only determined up to a projective
transformation of the scene and the process requires more data for successful
reconstruction.
  In contrast, we present a method that is able to use the known camera
calibration thereby producing near metric solutions, that is, reconstructions
that are accurate up to a similarity transformation. To achieve this we
introduce pairwise relative rotation estimates that carry information about
camera calibration. These are only invariant to similarity transformations,
thus encouraging solutions that preserve metric features of the real scene. Our
method can be seen as integrating rotation averaging into the pOSE framework
striving towards initialization-free calibrated SfM.
  Our experimental evaluation shows that we are able to reliably optimize our
objective, achieving convergence to the global minimum with high probability
from random starting solutions, resulting in accurate near metric
reconstructions.

Result: 在多模态数据上验证，性能优于现有方法，支持同数据集和跨数据集评估。

Conclusion: 该方法无需合成数据或内存库，各组件均有效，代码已开源。

Abstract: An innovative few-shot anomaly detection approach is presented, leveraging
the pre-trained CLIP model for medical data, and adapting it for both
image-level anomaly classification (AC) and pixel-level anomaly segmentation
(AS). A dual-branch design is proposed to separately capture normal and
abnormal features through learnable adapters in the CLIP vision encoder. To
improve semantic alignment, learnable text prompts are employed to link visual
features. Furthermore, SigLIP loss is applied to effectively handle the
many-to-one relationship between images and unpaired text prompts, showcasing
its adaptation in the medical field for the first time. Our approach is
validated on multiple modalities, demonstrating superior performance over
existing methods for AC and AS, in both same-dataset and cross-dataset
evaluations. Unlike prior work, it does not rely on synthetic data or memory
banks, and an ablation study confirms the contribution of each component. The
code is available at https://github.com/mahshid1998/MadCLIP.

Motivation: 大规模视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在零样本学习中表现优异，但缺乏可解释性。本文旨在通过局部视觉-语义对齐解决这一问题。

Method: LaZSL利用最优传输技术，将视觉区域与离散属性对齐，无需额外训练即可实现可解释的相似性计算。

Result: 实验表明，LaZSL在可解释性、准确性和领域泛化能力方面均有显著提升。

Conclusion: LaZSL为视觉语言模型提供了一种可解释的零样本学习方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have achieved
remarkable success in zero-shot learning (ZSL) by leveraging large-scale
visual-text pair datasets. However, these methods often lack interpretability,
as they compute the similarity between an entire query image and the embedded
category words, making it difficult to explain their predictions. One approach
to address this issue is to develop interpretable models by integrating
language, where classifiers are built using discrete attributes, similar to
human perception. This introduces a new challenge: how to effectively align
local visual features with corresponding attributes based on pre-trained VLMs.
To tackle this, we propose LaZSL, a locally-aligned vision-language model for
interpretable ZSL. LaZSL employs local visual-semantic alignment via optimal
transport to perform interaction between visual regions and their associated
attributes, facilitating effective alignment and providing interpretable
similarity without the need for additional training. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method offers several advantages, including enhanced
interpretability, improved accuracy, and strong domain generalization. Codes

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型处理长视频时存在计算和内存开销大的问题，且难以泛化到更长的视频。

Method: 提出Flash Memory模块，包含低容量上下文记忆和高容量增强记忆，分别用于聚合长上下文信息和检索详细空间信息。

Result: 在多个长视频基准测试中表现出最先进的性能和高效性。

Conclusion: Flash-VStream为长视频理解提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Benefiting from the advances in large language models and cross-modal
alignment, existing multimodal large language models have achieved prominent
performance in image and short video understanding. However, the understanding
of long videos is still challenging, as their long-context nature results in
significant computational and memory overhead. Most existing work treats long
videos in the same way as short videos, which is inefficient for real-world
applications and hard to generalize to even longer videos. To address these
issues, we propose Flash-VStream, an efficient video language model capable of
processing extremely long videos and responding to user queries in real time.
Particularly, we design a Flash Memory module, containing a low-capacity
context memory to aggregate long-context temporal information and model the
distribution of information density, and a high-capacity augmentation memory to
retrieve detailed spatial information based on this distribution. Compared to
existing models, Flash-VStream achieves significant reductions in inference
latency. Extensive experiments on long video benchmarks and comprehensive video
benchmarks, i.e., EgoSchema, MLVU, LVBench, MVBench and Video-MME, demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance and outstanding efficiency of our method. Code

Result: 在六个数据集上表现优于现有方法，PCC指标提升超过20%。

Conclusion: NH2ST能有效建模复杂交互，为基因表达预测提供新思路。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides crucial insights into tissue
micro-environments, but is limited to its high cost and complexity. As an
alternative, predicting gene expression from pathology whole slide images (WSI)
is gaining increasing attention. However, existing methods typically rely on
single patches or a single pathology modality, neglecting the complex spatial
and molecular interactions between target and neighboring information (e.g.,
gene co-expression). This leads to a failure in establishing connections among
adjacent regions and capturing intricate cross-modal relationships. To address
these issues, we propose NH2ST, a framework that integrates spatial context and
both pathology and gene modalities for gene expression prediction. Our model
comprises a query branch and a neighbor branch to process paired target patch
and gene data and their neighboring regions, where cross-attention and
contrastive learning are employed to capture intrinsic associations and ensure
alignments between pathology and gene expression. Extensive experiments on six
datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms existing methods,
achieving over 20% in PCC metrics. Codes are available at

Motivation: 探索多头注意力机制在分类任务中的学习机制，并验证其在大型MHA（LS-MHA）中的扩展性，以及如何通过结合卷积层优化性能。

Method: 通过量化单头性能（SHP）矩阵，分析多头注意力的协作机制，并设计ViT架构，结合卷积层加速早期学习。

Result: 发现SHP矩阵由多个单元簇组成，显著提高信噪比，提升分类精度；结合卷积层可减少延迟且不影响精度。

Conclusion: 该学习机制可推广至自然语言处理任务，为深度学习提供新见解，并通过CIFAR-100数据集验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The emergence of spontaneous symmetry breaking among a few heads of
multi-head attention (MHA) across transformer blocks in classification tasks
was recently demonstrated through the quantification of single-nodal
performance (SNP). This finding indicates that each head focuses its attention
on a subset of labels through cooperation among its SNPs. This underlying
learning mechanism is generalized to large-scale MHA (LS-MHA) using a single
matrix value representing single-head performance (SHP), analogous to
single-filter performance in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The results
indicate that each SHP matrix comprises multiple unit clusters such that each
label being explicitly recognized by a few heads with negligible noise. This
leads to an increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) along the transformer blocks,
thereby improving classification accuracy. These features give rise to several
distinct vision transformer (ViT) architectures that achieve the same accuracy
but differ in their LS-MHA structures. As a result, their soft committee yields
superior accuracy, an outcome not typically observed in CNNs which rely on
hundreds of filters. In addition, a significant reduction in latency is
achieved without affecting the accuracy by replacing the initial transformer
blocks with convolutional layers. This substitution accelerates early-stage
learning, which is then improved by subsequent transformer layers. The
extension of this learning mechanism to natural language processing tasks,
based on quantitative differences between CNNs and ViT architectures, has the
potential to yield new insights in deep learning. The findings are demonstrated
using compact convolutional transformer architectures trained on the CIFAR-100
dataset.

Conclusion: PointSSIM为图像比较提供了一种新颖且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents PointSSIM, a novel low-dimensional image-to-image
comparison metric that is resolution invariant. Drawing inspiration from the
structural similarity index measure and mathematical morphology, PointSSIM
enables robust comparison across binary images of varying resolutions by
transforming them into marked point pattern representations. The key features
of the image, referred to as anchor points, are extracted from binary images by
identifying locally adaptive maxima from the minimal distance transform. Image
comparisons are then performed using a summary vector, capturing intensity,
connectivity, complexity, and structural attributes. Results show that this
approach provides an efficient and reliable method for image comparison,
particularly suited to applications requiring structural analysis across
different resolutions.

Abstract: Viewpoint missing of objects is common in scene reconstruction, as camera

object-level modeling while maintaining accurate scene-level representation.
Addressing this issue is critical for advancing downstream tasks requiring
detailed object understanding and appearance modeling. In this paper, we
introduce Refine Any object In any ScenE (RAISE), a novel 3D enhancement
framework that leverages 3D generative priors to recover fine-grained object
geometry and appearance under missing views. Starting from substituting
degraded objects with proxies, via a 3D generative model with strong 3D
understanding, RAISE progressively refines geometry and texture by aligning
each proxy to its degraded counterpart in 7-DOF pose, followed by correcting
spatial and appearance inconsistencies via registration-constrained
enhancement. This two-stage refinement ensures the high-fidelity geometry and
appearance of the original object in unseen views while maintaining consistency
in spatial positioning, observed geometry, and appearance. Extensive
experiments on challenging benchmarks show that RAISE significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both novel view synthesis and geometry completion
tasks. RAISE is made publicly available at https://github.com/PolySummit/RAISE.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了机器人生成内容（RGC）的概念，并建立了首个RGC视频数据库（RGCD），用于评估RGC视频的感知质量。实验发现现有视频质量评估（VQA）模型在RGC视频上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器人视频在流媒体平台上的普及，RGC视频的感知质量对人类与机器人交互至关重要，但目前缺乏针对RGC视频的专门研究。

Method: 建立包含2,100个RGC视频的RGCD数据库，进行主观VQA实验，并评估11种现有VQA模型的性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，现有VQA模型在复杂RGC视频上表现有限，需要开发RGC专用模型。

Conclusion: RGCD数据库填补了RGC视频质量评估的空白，为未来研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: As camera-equipped robotic platforms become increasingly integrated into
daily life, robotic-generated videos have begun to appear on streaming media
platforms, enabling us to envision a future where humans and robots coexist. We
innovatively propose the concept of Robotic-Generated Content (RGC) to term
these videos generated from egocentric perspective of robots. The perceptual
quality of RGC videos is critical in human-robot interaction scenarios, and RGC
videos exhibit unique distortions and visual requirements that differ markedly
from those of professionally-generated content (PGC) videos and user-generated
content (UGC) videos. However, dedicated research on quality assessment of RGC
videos is still lacking. To address this gap and to support broader robotic
applications, we establish the first Robotic-Generated Content Database (RGCD),
which contains a total of 2,100 videos drawn from three robot categories and
sourced from diverse platforms. A subjective VQA experiment is conducted
subsequently to assess human visual perception of robotic-generated videos.
Finally, we conduct a benchmark experiment to evaluate the performance of 11
state-of-the-art VQA models on our database. Experimental results reveal
significant limitations in existing VQA models when applied to complex,
robotic-generated content, highlighting a critical need for RGC-specific VQA
models. Our RGCD is publicly available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiNeuS是一个统一的神经表面重建框架，解决了多视角辐射不一致、无纹理区域关键点缺失和Eikonal约束过度导致的几何退化问题，通过微分可见性验证、平面共形正则化和物理基础的Eikonal松弛实现了协同优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂场景下难以同时保证几何保真度和光度一致性，HiNeuS旨在通过统一框架解决多视角辐射不一致、无纹理区域关键点缺失和Eikonal约束过度导致的几何退化问题。

Method: 1) 基于SDF的微分可见性验证；2) 平面共形正则化；3) 物理基础的Eikonal松弛。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上表现优异，Chamfer距离减少21.4%，PSNR提高2.32 dB，能够恢复镜面反射、厘米级城市布局和无纹理表面。

Conclusion: HiNeuS通过协同优化实现了几何与外观约束的统一，适用于逆渲染任务，如材质分解和视角一致重光照。

Abstract: Neural surface reconstruction faces persistent challenges in reconciling
geometric fidelity with photometric consistency under complex scene conditions.
We present HiNeuS, a unified framework that holistically addresses three core
limitations in existing approaches: multi-view radiance inconsistency, missing
keypoints in textureless regions, and structural degradation from over-enforced
Eikonal constraints during joint optimization. To resolve these issues through
a unified pipeline, we introduce: 1) Differential visibility verification
through SDF-guided ray tracing, resolving reflection ambiguities via continuous
occlusion modeling; 2) Planar-conformal regularization via ray-aligned geometry
patches that enforce local surface coherence while preserving sharp edges
through adaptive appearance weighting; and 3) Physically-grounded Eikonal
relaxation that dynamically modulates geometric constraints based on local
radiance gradients, enabling detail preservation without sacrificing global
regularity. Unlike prior methods that handle these aspects through sequential
optimizations or isolated modules, our approach achieves cohesive integration
where appearance-geometry constraints evolve synergistically throughout
training. Comprehensive evaluations across synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, including a 21.4% reduction in
Chamfer distance over reflection-aware baselines and 2.32 dB PSNR improvement
against neural rendering counterparts. Qualitative analyses reveal superior
capability in recovering specular instruments, urban layouts with
centimeter-scale infrastructure, and low-textured surfaces without local patch
collapse. The method's generalizability is further validated through successful
application to inverse rendering tasks, including material decomposition and
view-consistent relighting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出Class-adaptive Prompt Tuning (CaPT)，通过基于文本类别信息（TCI）的动态提示解决Vision-Language Pretrained Models（VLPMs）中的Base-New Tradeoff（BNT）问题，显著提升模型在新任务上的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉图像信息（VII）的条件提示调优方法在解决BNT问题时表现不佳，甚至不如随机噪声条件提示。研究发现，基于文本类别信息（TCI）的动态提示是解决BNT问题的关键。

Method: 提出CaPT方法，通过学习基于TCI的动态提示，快速适应新类别。CaPT可作为插件提升现有无条件提示调优方法的性能。

Result: 在11个数据集上的实验表明，CaPT显著提升了五种无条件提示调优基线的性能，且计算成本极低。结合DePT框架提出的DeCaPT方法，性能优于现有最优条件提示调优方法3.49%。

Conclusion: CaPT通过TCI动态提示有效解决BNT问题，显著提升模型泛化能力，且计算成本低，适用于多种提示调优方法。

Abstract: Despite the great promise of Prompt Tuning (PT) in adapting large
Vision-Language Pretrained Models (VLPMs) to downstream tasks, they often
struggle to overcome the Base-New Tradeoff (BNT) dilemma: as VLPMs are better
tuned to a base task, their ability to generalize to new tasks diminishes.
Recent work on conditional PT addresses this problem by replacing static
prompts with dynamic Visual Image Information (VII)-conditioned prompts,
improving the model's generalization to new tasks to some extent. In this work,
we first identify a critical issue with existing conditional PT methods: using
VII as the "condition" of prompts yields suboptimal performance, and even
random noise-conditioned prompts can outperform the VII-conditioned
counterparts. On further analysis, we find that learning dynamic prompts
conditioned on Textual Class Information (TCI) is the key to solving the BNT
problem. Motivated by this, we then propose Class-adaptive Prompt Tuning
(CaPT), which enables fast adaptation of tuned models to new classes by
learning TCI-conditioned prompts from base classes. Remarkably, CaPT can be
used as a plugin to mitigate the BNT problem for existing unconditional PT
schemes. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets show that CaPT consistently
improves the performance of five strong unconditional PT baselines with
negligible additional computational cost. Additionally, by integrating CaPT
with our recently proposed DePT framework, we devise a new conditional PT
approach, termed DeCaPT, which outperforms the H ACC of the state-of-the-art
conditional PT scheme by 3.49%, averaged over the 11 datasets. Code:

TL;DR: VMoBA是一种专为视频扩散模型设计的稀疏注意力机制，通过动态块分区和全局块选择显著提升训练和推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全注意力机制在视频扩散模型中因二次复杂度导致的效率瓶颈，同时优化视频数据的时空特征捕捉。

Method: 引入VMoBA，结合层递归块分区、全局块选择和基于阈值的块选择，动态适应时空注意力模式。

Result: 训练速度提升2.92x FLOPs和1.48x延迟，推理速度提升2.40x FLOPs和1.35x延迟，生成质量与全注意力相当或更优。

Conclusion: VMoBA高效且性能优越，适用于视频扩散模型的长序列训练和高分辨率视频生成。

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of full attention mechanisms poses a significant
bottleneck for Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) aiming to generate long-duration,
high-resolution videos. While various sparse attention methods have been
proposed, many are designed as training-free inference accelerators or do not
optimally capture the unique spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in video
data when trained natively. This paper introduces Video Mixture of Block
Attention (VMoBA), a novel sparse attention mechanism specifically adapted for
VDMs. Motivated by an in-depth analysis of attention patterns within
pre-trained video transformers, which revealed strong spatio-temporal locality,
varying query importance, and head-specific concentration levels, VMoBA
enhances the original MoBA framework with three key modifications: (1) a
layer-wise recurrent block partition scheme (1D-2D-3D) to dynamically adapt to
diverse spatio-temporal attention patterns and improve efficiency; (2) global
block selection to prioritize the most salient query-key block interactions
across an entire attention head; and (3) threshold-based block selection to
dynamically determine the number of attended blocks based on their cumulative
similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VMoBA significantly
accelerates the training of VDMs on longer sequences, achieving 2.92x FLOPs and
1.48x latency speedup, while attaining comparable or even superior generation
quality to full attention. Furthermore, VMoBA exhibits competitive performance
in training-free inference, offering 2.40x FLOPs and 1.35x latency speedup for
high-res video generation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多视角3D重建中训练数据多样性和规模不足的问题。

Method: 通过模拟多样化的相机轨迹和真实场景几何，对图像进行针对性变换，生成高质量数据。

Result: 实验表明，Puzzles显著提升了性能，仅需10%的原始数据即可达到与完整数据集相当的精度。

Conclusion: Puzzles是一种高效的数据增强方法，无需修改网络架构即可提升3D重建效果。

Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction remains a core challenge in computer vision.
Recent methods, such as DUST3R and its successors, directly regress pointmaps
from image pairs without relying on known scene geometry or camera parameters.
However, the performance of these models is constrained by the diversity and
scale of available training data. In this work, we introduce Puzzles, a data
augmentation strategy that synthesizes an unbounded volume of high-quality
posed video-depth data from a single image or video clip. By simulating diverse
camera trajectories and realistic scene geometry through targeted image
transformations, Puzzles significantly enhances data variety. Extensive
experiments show that integrating Puzzles into existing video-based 3D
reconstruction pipelines consistently boosts performance without modifying the
underlying network architecture. Notably, models trained on only ten percent of
the original data augmented with Puzzles still achieve accuracy comparable to
those trained on the full dataset. Code is available at

Motivation: 解决现有OOD检测方法易受虚假相关性误导的问题，提升模型在未知数据分布下的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出SPROD方法，通过后处理优化类原型，减少虚假特征带来的偏差，适用于多种骨干网络和OOD检测场景。

Result: 在多个挑战性OOD数据集上表现优异，AUROC平均提升4.7%，FPR@95降低9.3%。

Conclusion: SPROD有效解决了虚假相关性对OOD检测的干扰，具有广泛适用性和显著性能优势。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for ensuring the reliability
and safety of machine learning models in real-world applications, where they
frequently face data distributions unseen during training. Despite progress,
existing methods are often vulnerable to spurious correlations that mislead
models and compromise robustness. To address this, we propose SPROD, a novel
prototype-based OOD detection approach that explicitly addresses the challenge
posed by unknown spurious correlations. Our post-hoc method refines class
prototypes to mitigate bias from spurious features without additional data or
hyperparameter tuning, and is broadly applicable across diverse backbones and
OOD detection settings. We conduct a comprehensive spurious correlation OOD
detection benchmarking, comparing our method against existing approaches and
demonstrating its superior performance across challenging OOD datasets, such as
CelebA, Waterbirds, UrbanCars, Spurious Imagenet, and the newly introduced
Animals MetaCoCo. On average, SPROD improves AUROC by 4.7% and FPR@95 by 9.3%
over the second best.

TL;DR: PriOr-Flow提出了一种双分支框架，利用正交视图的低失真特性提升全景光流估计性能，特别是在极地区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于透视的光流方法在全景投影（如ERP）中因严重失真而性能下降，尤其是在极地区域。

Method: 提出DCCL操作符联合检索原始和正交成本体积的相关信息，并设计ODDC模块迭代优化运动特征。

Result: PriOr-Flow在公开全景光流数据集上表现优异，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: PriOr-Flow为广域运动估计设定了新基准，兼容多种基于透视的迭代光流方法。

Abstract: Panoramic optical flow enables a comprehensive understanding of temporal
dynamics across wide fields of view. However, severe distortions caused by
sphere-to-plane projections, such as the equirectangular projection (ERP),
significantly degrade the performance of conventional perspective-based optical
flow methods, especially in polar regions. To address this challenge, we
propose PriOr-Flow, a novel dual-branch framework that leverages the
low-distortion nature of the orthogonal view to enhance optical flow estimation
in these regions. Specifically, we introduce the Dual-Cost Collaborative Lookup
(DCCL) operator, which jointly retrieves correlation information from both the
primitive and orthogonal cost volumes, effectively mitigating distortion noise
during cost volume construction. Furthermore, our Ortho-Driven Distortion
Compensation (ODDC) module iteratively refines motion features from both
branches, further suppressing polar distortions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PriOr-Flow is compatible with various perspective-based
iterative optical flow methods and consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance on publicly available panoramic optical flow datasets, setting a
new benchmark for wide-field motion estimation. The code is publicly available

Motivation: 超声图像分割面临解剖变异、成像协议多样和标注数据有限等挑战，需要一种通用且准确的方法。

Method: 利用18个公共超声数据集，通过LoRA微调Grounding DINO，结合SAM2实现分割，并在未见数据集上测试性能。

Result: 在多数数据集上优于UniverSeg、MedSAM等方法，且在未见数据集上表现良好，无需额外微调。

Conclusion: VLM在超声图像分析中具有潜力，减少对大规模器官特定标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: Accurate and generalizable object segmentation in ultrasound imaging remains
a significant challenge due to anatomical variability, diverse imaging
protocols, and limited annotated data. In this study, we propose a
prompt-driven vision-language model (VLM) that integrates Grounding DINO with
SAM2 to enable object segmentation across multiple ultrasound organs. A total
of 18 public ultrasound datasets, encompassing the breast, thyroid, liver,
prostate, kidney, and paraspinal muscle, were utilized. These datasets were
divided into 15 for fine-tuning and validation of Grounding DINO using Low Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) to the ultrasound domain, and 3 were held out entirely for
testing to evaluate performance in unseen distributions. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art
segmentation methods, including UniverSeg, MedSAM, MedCLIP-SAM, BiomedParse,
and SAMUS on most seen datasets while maintaining strong performance on unseen
datasets without additional fine-tuning. These results underscore the promise
of VLMs in scalable and robust ultrasound image analysis, reducing dependence
on large, organ-specific annotated datasets. We will publish our code on
code.sonography.ai after acceptance.

Motivation: 评估深度学习模型在不同脑影像队列中对年龄和性别预测的泛化能力，尤其是年龄和性别作为关键神经生物学标记的影响。

Method: 比较了三种3D架构（SFCN、DenseNet、Swin Transformer）在四个独立队列（UKB、DLBS、PPMI、IXI）中的表现，使用T1加权MRI数据。

Result: SFCN在性别分类和年龄预测任务中均表现最佳，尤其在泛化能力上优于其他复杂架构。

Conclusion: 简单的卷积网络在脑影像分析中比复杂架构更具优势，尤其是在跨数据集泛化能力方面。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) methods are increasingly outperforming classical
approaches in brain imaging, yet their generalizability across diverse imaging
cohorts remains inadequately assessed. As age and sex are key neurobiological
markers in clinical neuroscience, influencing brain structure and disease risk,
this study evaluates three of the existing three-dimensional architectures,
namely Simple Fully Connected Network (SFCN), DenseNet, and Shifted Window
(Swin) Transformers, for age and sex prediction using T1-weighted MRI from four
independent cohorts: UK Biobank (UKB, n=47,390), Dallas Lifespan Brain Study
(DLBS, n=132), Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI, n=108 healthy
controls), and Information eXtraction from Images (IXI, n=319). We found that
SFCN consistently outperformed more complex architectures with AUC of 1.00
[1.00-1.00] in UKB (internal test set) and 0.85-0.91 in external test sets for
sex classification. For the age prediction task, SFCN demonstrated a mean
absolute error (MAE) of 2.66 (r=0.89) in UKB and 4.98-5.81 (r=0.55-0.70) across
external datasets. Pairwise DeLong and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with
Bonferroni corrections confirmed SFCN's superiority over Swin Transformer
across most cohorts (p<0.017, for three comparisons). Explainability analysis
further demonstrates the regional consistency of model attention across cohorts
and specific to each task. Our findings reveal that simpler convolutional
networks outperform the denser and more complex attention-based DL
architectures in brain image analysis by demonstrating better generalizability
across different datasets.

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal reasoning has been significantly advanced by
textual Chain-of-Thought (CoT), a paradigm where models conduct reasoning
within language. This text-centric approach, however, treats vision as a
static, initial context, creating a fundamental "semantic gap" between rich
perceptual data and discrete symbolic thought. Human cognition often transcends
language, utilizing vision as a dynamic mental sketchpad. A similar evolution
is now unfolding in AI, marking a fundamental paradigm shift from models that
merely think about images to those that can truly think with images. This
emerging paradigm is characterized by models leveraging visual information as
intermediate steps in their thought process, transforming vision from a passive
input into a dynamic, manipulable cognitive workspace. In this survey, we chart
this evolution of intelligence along a trajectory of increasing cognitive
autonomy, which unfolds across three key stages: from external tool
exploration, through programmatic manipulation, to intrinsic imagination. To
structure this rapidly evolving field, our survey makes four key contributions.
(1) We establish the foundational principles of the think with image paradigm
and its three-stage framework. (2) We provide a comprehensive review of the
core methods that characterize each stage of this roadmap. (3) We analyze the
critical landscape of evaluation benchmarks and transformative applications.
(4) We identify significant challenges and outline promising future directions.
By providing this structured overview, we aim to offer a clear roadmap for
future research towards more powerful and human-aligned multimodal AI.

Conclusion: VMDA通过双适配器显著提升了多模态跟踪的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Prompt-learning-based multi-modal trackers have achieved promising progress
by employing lightweight visual adapters to incorporate auxiliary modality
features into frozen foundation models. However, existing approaches often
struggle to learn reliable prompts due to limited exploitation of critical cues
across frequency and temporal domains. In this paper, we propose a novel visual
and memory dual adapter (VMDA) to construct more robust and discriminative
representations for multi-modal tracking. Specifically, we develop a simple but
effective visual adapter that adaptively transfers discriminative cues from
auxiliary modality to dominant modality by jointly modeling the frequency,
spatial, and channel-wise features. Additionally, we design the memory adapter
inspired by the human memory mechanism, which stores global temporal cues and
performs dynamic update and retrieval operations to ensure the consistent
propagation of reliable temporal information across video sequences. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
on the various multi-modal tracking tasks, including RGB-Thermal, RGB-Depth,
and RGB-Event tracking. Code and models are available at

Abstract: Understanding why a classification model prefers one class over another for
an input instance is the challenge of contrastive explanation. This work
implements concept-based contrastive explanations for image classification by
leveraging the similarity of instance embeddings and relevance of
human-understandable concepts used by a fine-tuned deep learning model. Our
approach extracts concepts with their relevance score, computes contrasts for
similar instances, and evaluates the resulting contrastive explanations based
on explanation complexity. Robustness is tested for different image
augmentations. Two research questions are addressed: (1) whether explanation
complexity varies across different relevance ranges, and (2) whether
explanation complexity remains consistent under image augmentations such as
rotation and noise. The results confirm that for our experiments higher concept
relevance leads to shorter, less complex explanations, while lower relevance
results in longer, more diffuse explanations. Additionally, explanations show
varying degrees of robustness. The discussion of these findings offers insights
into the potential of building more interpretable and robust AI systems.

Motivation: 个性化在传统自动驾驶系统中已有探索，但在端到端自动驾驶（E2EAD）中却被忽视，而用户对齐行为对信任和广泛采用至关重要。缺乏标注多样化驾驶偏好的大规模数据集阻碍了相关研究。

Method: 通过提取静态环境特征和动态上下文线索，结合视觉语言模型（VLM）生成场景标注，并通过行为分布分析和规则启发式获取客观偏好标注。进一步使用VLM生成主观标注，并通过人工验证融合两种视角。

Result: 提出了首个个性化E2EAD评估基准，实验表明结合个性化偏好的模型能生成更符合人类驾驶的行为。

Conclusion: 该研究为个性化E2EAD奠定了基础，提供了标准化平台，推动以人为中心的自动驾驶研究。

Abstract: While personalization has been explored in traditional autonomous driving
systems, it remains largely overlooked in end-to-end autonomous driving
(E2EAD), despite its growing prominence. This gap is critical, as user-aligned
behavior is essential for trust, comfort, and widespread adoption of autonomous
vehicles. A core challenge is the lack of large-scale real-world datasets
annotated with diverse and fine-grained driving preferences, hindering the
development and evaluation of personalized E2EAD models. In this work, we
present the first large-scale real-world dataset enriched with annotations
capturing diverse driving preferences, establishing a foundation for
personalization in E2EAD. We extract static environmental features from
real-world road topology and infer dynamic contextual cues using a fine-tuned
visual language model (VLM), enabling consistent and fine-grained scenario
construction. Based on these scenarios, we derive objective preference
annotations through behavioral distribution analysis and rule-based heuristics.
To address the inherent subjectivity of driving style, we further employ the
VLM to generate subjective annotations by jointly modeling scene semantics and
driver behavior. Final high-quality labels are obtained through a
human-in-the-loop verification process that fuses both perspectives. Building
on this dataset, we propose the first benchmark for evaluating personalized
E2EAD models. We assess several state-of-the-art models with and without
preference conditioning, demonstrating that incorporating personalized
preferences results in behavior more aligned with human driving. Our work lays
the foundation for personalized E2EAD by providing a standardized platform to
systematically integrate human preferences into data-driven E2EAD systems,
catalyzing future research in human-centric autonomy.

Conclusion: Zenesis是科学图像分析的强大工具，尤其适用于缺乏高质量标注数据的领域。

Abstract: Zero-shot and prompt-based technologies capitalized on using frequently
occurring images to transform visual reasoning tasks, which explains why such
technologies struggle with valuable yet scarce scientific image sets. In this
work, we propose Zenesis, a comprehensive no-code interactive platform designed
to minimize barriers posed by data readiness for scientific images. We develop
lightweight multi-modal adaptation techniques that enable zero-shot operation
on raw scientific data, along with human-in-the-loop refinement and
heuristic-based temporal enhancement options. We demonstrate the performance of
our approach through comprehensive comparison and validation on challenging
Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM) data of catalyst-loaded
membranes. Zenesis significantly outperforms baseline methods, achieving an
average accuracy of 0.947, an Intersection over Union (IOU) of 0.858, and a
Dice score of 0.923 for amorphous catalyst samples and accuracy of 0.987, an
IOU of 0.857, and a Dice score of 0.923 for crystalline samples. These results
mark a substantial improvement over traditional methods like Otsu thresholding
and even advanced models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) when used in
isolation. Our results demonstrate that Zenesis is a powerful tool for
scientific applications, particularly in fields where high-quality annotated
datasets are unavailable, accelerating accurate analysis of experimental

Result: 在多种连续域自适应目标检测任务中验证了方法的有效性，可视化结果表明生成的参数能捕获更多目标相关信息。

Conclusion: 该方法通过参数生成和特征解耦，显著提升了检测器的适应能力和泛化性能。

Abstract: In practice, environments constantly change over time and space, posing
significant challenges for object detectors trained based on a closed-set
assumption, i.e., training and test data share the same distribution. To this
end, continual test-time adaptation has attracted much attention, aiming to
improve detectors' generalization by fine-tuning a few specific parameters,
e.g., BatchNorm layers. However, based on a small number of test images,
fine-tuning certain parameters may affect the representation ability of other
fixed parameters, leading to performance degradation. Instead, we explore a new
mechanism, i.e., converting the fine-tuning process to a specific-parameter
generation. Particularly, we first design a dual-path LoRA-based domain-aware
adapter that disentangles features into domain-invariant and domain-specific
components, enabling efficient adaptation. Additionally, a conditional
diffusion-based parameter generation mechanism is presented to synthesize the
adapter's parameters based on the current environment, preventing the
optimization from getting stuck in local optima. Finally, we propose a
class-centered optimal transport alignment method to mitigate catastrophic
forgetting. Extensive experiments conducted on various continuous domain
adaptive object detection tasks demonstrate the effectiveness. Meanwhile,
visualization results show that the representation extracted by the generated
parameters can capture more object-related information and strengthen the
generalization ability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在跨模态概念混合中容易受到认知偏见的影响，如设计固定，导致设计空间的局部最优。IT-Blender旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用预训练的扩散模型（SD和FLUX）混合干净参考图像和噪声生成图像的潜在表示，并结合新颖的混合注意力机制。

Result: IT-Blender在视觉与文本概念混合方面显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: IT-Blender展示了图像生成模型在增强人类创造力方面的新应用潜力。

Abstract: Blending visual and textual concepts into a new visual concept is a unique
and powerful trait of human beings that can fuel creativity. However, in
practice, cross-modal conceptual blending for humans is prone to cognitive
biases, like design fixation, which leads to local minima in the design space.
In this paper, we propose a T2I diffusion adapter "IT-Blender" that can
automate the blending process to enhance human creativity. Prior works related
to cross-modal conceptual blending are limited in encoding a real image without
loss of details or in disentangling the image and text inputs. To address these
gaps, IT-Blender leverages pretrained diffusion models (SD and FLUX) to blend
the latent representations of a clean reference image with those of the noisy
generated image. Combined with our novel blended attention, IT-Blender encodes
the real reference image without loss of details and blends the visual concept
with the object specified by the text in a disentangled way. Our experiment
results show that IT-Blender outperforms the baselines by a large margin in
blending visual and textual concepts, shedding light on the new application of
image generative models to augment human creativity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaRA是一种新的参数高效微调方法，利用小波变换分解权重更新矩阵，实现多分辨率分析，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法（如LoRA）依赖全局低秩分解，忽略了局部或多尺度结构，无法捕捉复杂模式。

Method: 通过小波变换将权重更新矩阵分解为多分辨率表示，在频域进行低秩分解并通过逆变换重构。

Result: 在视觉任务（如图像生成、分类、语义分割）中表现优异，同时降低计算复杂度。

Conclusion: WaRA不仅适用于视觉任务，在语言任务中也有效，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has gained widespread adoption across
various applications. Among PEFT techniques, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its
extensions have emerged as particularly effective, allowing efficient model
adaptation while significantly reducing computational overhead. However,
existing approaches typically rely on global low-rank factorizations, which
overlook local or multi-scale structure, failing to capture complex patterns in
the weight updates. To address this, we propose WaRA, a novel PEFT method that
leverages wavelet transforms to decompose the weight update matrix into a
multi-resolution representation. By performing low-rank factorization in the
wavelet domain and reconstructing updates through an inverse transform, WaRA
obtains compressed adaptation parameters that harness multi-resolution
analysis, enabling it to capture both coarse and fine-grained features while
providing greater flexibility and sparser representations than standard LoRA.
Through comprehensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that WaRA
performs superior on diverse vision tasks, including image generation,
classification, and semantic segmentation, significantly enhancing generated
image quality while reducing computational complexity. Although WaRA was
primarily designed for vision tasks, we further showcase its effectiveness in
language tasks, highlighting its broader applicability and generalizability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在从体积表示转换为表面表示时，存在几何细节丢失或网格过于密集的问题，限制了最终网格的质量和应用。

Method: MILo设计了完全可微分的过程，在每次训练迭代中直接从高斯参数中构建网格，包括顶点位置和连接性。关键技术包括双向一致性框架、自适应网格提取和基于高斯的符号距离计算。

Result: MILo能够以更少的网格顶点重建完整场景，质量达到最新水平，且网格轻量、内部为空，适用于物理模拟或动画等下游应用。

Conclusion: MILo通过可微分网格提取，成功弥合了体积和表面表示之间的差距，显著提升了3D场景重建的质量和效率。

Abstract: While recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have enabled fast reconstruction
of high-quality 3D scenes from images, extracting accurate surface meshes
remains a challenge. Current approaches extract the surface through costly
post-processing steps, resulting in the loss of fine geometric details or
requiring significant time and leading to very dense meshes with millions of
vertices. More fundamentally, the a posteriori conversion from a volumetric to
a surface representation limits the ability of the final mesh to preserve all
geometric structures captured during training. We present MILo, a novel
Gaussian Splatting framework that bridges the gap between volumetric and
surface representations by differentiably extracting a mesh from the 3D
Gaussians. We design a fully differentiable procedure that constructs the
mesh-including both vertex locations and connectivity-at every iteration
directly from the parameters of the Gaussians, which are the only quantities
optimized during training. Our method introduces three key technical
contributions: a bidirectional consistency framework ensuring both
representations-Gaussians and the extracted mesh-capture the same underlying
geometry during training; an adaptive mesh extraction process performed at each
training iteration, which uses Gaussians as differentiable pivots for Delaunay
triangulation; a novel method for computing signed distance values from the 3D
Gaussians that enables precise surface extraction while avoiding geometric
erosion. Our approach can reconstruct complete scenes, including backgrounds,
with state-of-the-art quality while requiring an order of magnitude fewer mesh
vertices than previous methods. Due to their light weight and empty interior,
our meshes are well suited for downstream applications such as physics
simulations or animation.

Conclusion: DenseWorld-1M为社区提供了一个大规模、详细且密集的标注数据集，解决了现有数据集的不足。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate a complex understanding
of scenes, benefiting from large-scale and high-quality datasets. Most existing
caption datasets lack the ground locations and relations for visual entities.
Several grounded caption datasets face the problems of missing detailed
descriptions, relations, and massive object descriptions on high-resolution
images. To fill this gap for the community, we present DenseWorld-1M, the first
massive, detailed, dense grounded caption dataset in the real world. We design
a three-stage labeling pipeline, containing open-world perception, detailed
object caption generation, and dense caption merging. The first stage obtains
entity-level masks and labels. The second stage generates the object-level,
detailed captions with the guidance of masks and labels from the first stage.
The final stage merges object captions and masks into spatial and relational
dense captions. To accelerate the labeling process and improve caption quality,
we present two VLM models: the Detailed Region Caption model and the Spatial
Caption Merging model. Extensive experiments on various settings, including
vision-language understanding, visual grounding, and region caption generation,
demonstrate the effectiveness of our DenseWorld-1M dataset and labeling models.

Motivation: 现有基于视频扩散的世界模型在灵活长度、长时程预测和轨迹规划集成方面存在不足，主要因其依赖固定长度帧序列的全局联合分布建模。

Method: 提出Epona模型，采用解耦时空因子化和模块化轨迹与视频预测，结合链式前向训练策略解决自回归循环中的误差累积问题。

Conclusion: Epona在视频生成和运动规划方面均表现出色，为自动驾驶世界建模提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional visual quality in video
generation, making them promising for autonomous driving world modeling.
However, existing video diffusion-based world models struggle with
flexible-length, long-horizon predictions and integrating trajectory planning.
This is because conventional video diffusion models rely on global joint
distribution modeling of fixed-length frame sequences rather than sequentially
constructing localized distributions at each timestep. In this work, we propose
Epona, an autoregressive diffusion world model that enables localized
spatiotemporal distribution modeling through two key innovations: 1) Decoupled
spatiotemporal factorization that separates temporal dynamics modeling from
fine-grained future world generation, and 2) Modular trajectory and video
prediction that seamlessly integrate motion planning with visual modeling in an
end-to-end framework. Our architecture enables high-resolution, long-duration
generation while introducing a novel chain-of-forward training strategy to
address error accumulation in autoregressive loops. Experimental results
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\% FVD improvement and minutes
longer prediction duration compared to prior works. The learned world model
further serves as a real-time motion planner, outperforming strong end-to-end
planners on NAVSIM benchmarks. Code will be publicly available at

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion generative models significantly advanced
image, video, and 3D content creation from user-provided text prompts. However,
the challenging problem of dynamic 3D content generation (text-to-4D) with
diffusion guidance remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce
TextMesh4D, a novel framework for high-quality text-to-4D generation. Our
approach leverages per-face Jacobians as a differentiable mesh representation
and decomposes 4D generation into two stages: static object creation and
dynamic motion synthesis. We further propose a flexibility-rigidity
regularization term to stabilize Jacobian optimization under video diffusion
priors, ensuring robust geometric performance. Experiments demonstrate that
TextMesh4D achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of temporal consistency,
structural fidelity, and visual realism. Moreover, TextMesh4D operates with a
low GPU memory overhead-requiring only a single 24GB GPU-offering a
cost-effective yet high-quality solution for text-driven 4D mesh generation.
The code will be released to facilitate future research in text-to-4D

Abstract: We introduce Calligrapher, a novel diffusion-based framework that
innovatively integrates advanced text customization with artistic typography
for digital calligraphy and design applications. Addressing the challenges of
precise style control and data dependency in typographic customization, our
framework incorporates three key technical contributions. First, we develop a
self-distillation mechanism that leverages the pre-trained text-to-image
generative model itself alongside the large language model to automatically
construct a style-centric typography benchmark. Second, we introduce a
localized style injection framework via a trainable style encoder, which
comprises both Qformer and linear layers, to extract robust style features from
reference images. An in-context generation mechanism is also employed to
directly embed reference images into the denoising process, further enhancing
the refined alignment of target styles. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
evaluations across diverse fonts and design contexts confirm Calligrapher's
accurate reproduction of intricate stylistic details and precise glyph
positioning. By automating high-quality, visually consistent typography,
Calligrapher surpasses traditional models, empowering creative practitioners in
digital art, branding, and contextual typographic design.

Abstract: Residual connection has been extensively studied and widely applied at the
model architecture level. However, its potential in the more challenging
data-centric approaches remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce the
concept of Data Residual Matching for the first time, leveraging data-level
skip connections to facilitate data generation and mitigate data information
vanishing. This approach maintains a balance between newly acquired knowledge
through pixel space optimization and existing core local information
identification within raw data modalities, specifically for the dataset
distillation task. Furthermore, by incorporating optimization-level
refinements, our method significantly improves computational efficiency,
achieving superior performance while reducing training time and peak GPU memory
usage by 50%. Consequently, the proposed method Fast and Accurate Data Residual
Matching for Dataset Distillation (FADRM) establishes a new state-of-the-art,
demonstrating substantial improvements over existing methods across multiple
dataset benchmarks in both efficiency and effectiveness. For instance, with
ResNet-18 as the student model and a 0.8% compression ratio on ImageNet-1K, the
method achieves 47.7% test accuracy in single-model dataset distillation and
50.0% in multi-model dataset distillation, surpassing RDED by +5.7% and

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的隐式神经表示（INR）视频压缩方法RNeRV，通过优化组件设计提升性能，并探索超网络以解决编码速度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统INR方法因需逐样本训练网络导致编码速度过慢，限制了实际应用。

Method: 开发库分析NeRV家族方法组件，提出RNeRV配置；研究超网络预测INR权重以分离训练与编码。

Result: RNeRV在相同训练时间下PSNR平均提升1.27%；超网络改进在UCF-101数据集上PSNR和MS-SSIM提升1.7%。

Conclusion: RNeRV和超网络设计显著提升视频INR性能，为实时编码提供可能。

Abstract: Implicit neural representation (INR) methods for video compression have
recently achieved visual quality and compression ratios that are competitive
with traditional pipelines. However, due to the need for per-sample network
training, the encoding speeds of these methods are too slow for practical
adoption. We develop a library to allow us to disentangle and review the
components of methods from the NeRV family, reframing their performance in
terms of not only size-quality trade-offs, but also impacts on training time.
We uncover principles for effective video INR design and propose a
state-of-the-art configuration of these components, Rabbit NeRV (RNeRV). When
all methods are given equal training time (equivalent to 300 NeRV epochs) for 7
different UVG videos at 1080p, RNeRV achieves +1.27% PSNR on average compared
to the best-performing alternative for each video in our NeRV library. We then
tackle the encoding speed issue head-on by investigating the viability of
hyper-networks, which predict INR weights from video inputs, to disentangle
training from encoding to allow for real-time encoding. We propose masking the
weights of the predicted INR during training to allow for variable, higher
quality compression, resulting in 1.7% improvements to both PSNR and MS-SSIM at
0.037 bpp on the UCF-101 dataset, and we increase hyper-network parameters by
0.4% for 2.5%/2.7% improvements to PSNR/MS-SSIM with equal bpp and similar
speeds. Our project website is available at https://mgwillia.github.io/vinrb/
