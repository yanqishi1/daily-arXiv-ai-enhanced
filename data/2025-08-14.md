### [1] [ParallelSearch: Train your LLMs to Decompose Query and Search Sub-queries in Parallel with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09303)
*Shu Zhao,Tan Yu,Anbang Xu,Japinder Singh,Aaditya Shukla,Rama Akkiraju*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ParallelSearch是一种新的强化学习框架，通过并行处理搜索查询提高效率，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有搜索代理在处理并行化查询时存在效率瓶颈，限制了计算效率。

Method: 提出ParallelSearch框架，利用LLM识别并行化查询结构并同时执行多个搜索操作，引入奖励函数优化查询分解和并行执行。

Result: 在七个问答基准测试中平均性能提升2.9%，并行化问题性能提升12.7%，且LLM调用减少30.4%。

Conclusion: ParallelSearch显著提高了搜索代理的效率，尤其在并行化查询任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented search agents such as Search-R1, trained via
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in multi-step information retrieval from external knowledge
sources. These agents address the limitations of their parametric memory by
dynamically gathering relevant facts to address complex reasoning tasks.
However, existing approaches suffer from a fundamental architectural
limitation: they process search queries strictly sequentially, even when
handling inherently parallelizable and logically independent comparisons. This
sequential bottleneck significantly constrains computational efficiency,
particularly for queries that require multiple entity comparisons. To address
this critical limitation, we propose ParallelSearch, a novel reinforcement
learning framework that empowers large language models (LLMs) to recognize
parallelizable query structures and execute multiple search operations
concurrently. Our approach introduces dedicated reward functions that
incentivize the identification of independent query components while preserving
answer accuracy through jointly considering correctness, query decomposition
quality, and parallel execution benefits. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that ParallelSearch outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an average
performance gain of 2.9% across seven question-answering benchmarks. Notably,
on parallelizable questions, our method achieves a 12.7% performance
improvement while requiring only 69.6% of the LLM calls compared to sequential
approaches.

### [2] [Leveraging Large Language Models for Rare Disease Named Entity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09323)
*Nan Miles Xi,Yu Deng,Lin Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了在罕见疾病领域中命名实体识别（NER）的挑战，评估了GPT-4o在低资源环境下的表现，并提出了一种结构化提示框架和语义引导的少样本示例选择方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见疾病领域的NER面临标注数据有限、实体类型语义模糊和长尾分布等挑战，需要探索高效的低资源解决方案。

Method: 采用多种提示策略（零样本、少样本、检索增强生成和任务级微调），设计结构化提示框架，并引入语义引导的少样本示例选择方法。

Result: 在RareDis Corpus上，GPT-4o表现优于BioClinicalBERT，任务级微调达到新SOTA。少样本提示在低标记预算下高效，RAG收益有限。

Conclusion: 提示优化的LLM可作为罕见疾病NER中传统监督模型的有效替代方案，尤其在标注数据稀缺的情况下。

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) in the rare disease domain poses unique
challenges due to limited labeled data, semantic ambiguity between entity
types, and long-tail distributions. In this study, we evaluate the capabilities
of GPT-4o for rare disease NER under low-resource settings, using a range of
prompt-based strategies including zero-shot prompting, few-shot in-context
learning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and task-level fine-tuning. We
design a structured prompting framework that encodes domain-specific knowledge
and disambiguation rules for four entity types. We further introduce two
semantically guided few-shot example selection methods to improve in-context
performance while reducing labeling effort. Experiments on the RareDis Corpus
show that GPT-4o achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
BioClinicalBERT, with task-level fine-tuning yielding new state-of-the-art
(SOTA) results. Cost-performance analysis reveals that few-shot prompting
delivers high returns at low token budgets, while RAG offers marginal
additional benefit. An error taxonomy highlights common failure modes such as
boundary drift and type confusion, suggesting opportunities for post-processing
and hybrid refinement. Our results demonstrate that prompt-optimized LLMs can
serve as effective, scalable alternatives to traditional supervised models in
biomedical NER, particularly in rare disease applications where annotated data
is scarce.

### [3] [TEN: Table Explicitization, Neurosymbolically](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09324)
*Nikita Mehrotra,Aayush Kumar,Sumit Gulwani,Arjun Radhakrishna,Ashish Tiwari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TEN是一种神经符号方法，用于从半结构化文本中提取表格数据，结合了大型语言模型和符号检查器，显著优于纯神经方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决半结构化文本中表格数据提取的挑战，尤其是缺乏明确分隔符的情况，纯神经方法因幻觉和无法强制约束而表现不佳。

Method: 采用结构分解提示和符号检查器，通过自调试循环修正表格。

Result: 在多个数据集和指标上显著优于基线，准确率更高，幻觉率更低，用户研究也验证了其优越性。

Conclusion: TEN通过神经符号结合的方法，有效解决了表格提取问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We present a neurosymbolic approach, TEN, for extracting tabular data from
semistructured input text. This task is particularly challenging for text input
that does not use special delimiters consistently to separate columns and rows.
Purely neural approaches perform poorly due to hallucinations and their
inability to enforce hard constraints. TEN uses Structural Decomposition
prompting - a specialized chain-of-thought prompting approach - on a large
language model (LLM) to generate an initial table, and thereafter uses a
symbolic checker to evaluate not only the well-formedness of that table, but
also detect cases of hallucinations or forgetting. The output of the symbolic
checker is processed by a critique-LLM to generate guidance for fixing the
table, which is presented to the original LLM in a self-debug loop. Our
extensive experiments demonstrate that TEN significantly outperforms purely
neural baselines across multiple datasets and metrics, achieving significantly
higher exact match accuracy and substantially reduced hallucination rates. A
21-participant user study further confirms that TEN's tables are rated
significantly more accurate (mean score: 5.0 vs 4.3; p = 0.021), and are
consistently preferred for ease of verification and correction, with
participants favoring our method in over 60% of the cases.

### [4] [Decoding Neural Emotion Patterns through Natural Language Processing Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09337)
*Gideon Vos,Maryam Ebrahimpour,Liza van Eijk,Zoltan Sarnyai,Mostafa Rahimi Azghadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种将文本情感内容映射到大脑区域的框架，无需神经影像数据，并验证了其在健康与抑郁人群、不同情感数据集及AI生成文本中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经影像成本高且受限，而数字文本为情感-大脑映射提供了新途径。现有研究缺乏将神经影像与文本分析的整合。

Method: 使用OpenAI的文本嵌入生成语义表示，降维聚类后映射到18个情感相关脑区，通过三个实验验证方法。

Result: 结果显示高空间特异性的神经解剖映射，抑郁人群负面情感相关脑区更活跃，AI文本在基础情感分布上与人类相似但缺乏某些脑区激活。

Conclusion: 该方法成本低、可扩展，适用于自然语言分析，能区分临床群体并为AI情感表达提供脑基准。

Abstract: Understanding how emotional expression in language relates to brain function
is a challenge in computational neuroscience and affective computing.
Traditional neuroimaging is costly and lab-bound, but abundant digital text
offers new avenues for emotion-brain mapping. Prior work has largely examined
neuroimaging-based emotion localization or computational text analysis
separately, with little integration. We propose a computational framework that
maps textual emotional content to anatomically defined brain regions without
requiring neuroimaging. Using OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002, we generate
high-dimensional semantic representations, apply dimensionality reduction and
clustering to identify emotional groups, and map them to 18 brain regions
linked to emotional processing. Three experiments were conducted: i) analyzing
conversational data from healthy vs. depressed subjects (DIAC-WOZ dataset) to
compare mapping patterns, ii) applying the method to the GoEmotions dataset and
iii) comparing human-written text with large language model (LLM) responses to
assess differences in inferred brain activation. Emotional intensity was scored
via lexical analysis. Results showed neuroanatomically plausible mappings with
high spatial specificity. Depressed subjects exhibited greater limbic
engagement tied to negative affect. Discrete emotions were successfully
differentiated. LLM-generated text matched humans in basic emotion distribution
but lacked nuanced activation in empathy and self-referential regions (medial
prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortex). This cost-effective, scalable
approach enables large-scale analysis of naturalistic language, distinguishes
between clinical populations, and offers a brain-based benchmark for evaluating
AI emotional expression.

### [5] [The Human-AI Hybrid Delphi Model: A Structured Framework for Context-Rich, Expert Consensus in Complex Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09349)
*Cathy Speed,Ahmed A. Metwally*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种结合人类专家与生成式AI（Gemini 2.5 Pro）的混合德尔菲框架（HAH-Delphi），用于提升专家共识的质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统共识方法（如德尔菲研究）存在专家负担重、信息过载和证据碎片化等问题，需要一种更高效、灵活的解决方案。

Method: HAH-Delphi框架整合了生成式AI、小型专家小组和结构化引导，分三个阶段测试：回顾性复制、前瞻性比较和应用部署。

Result: AI在回顾性复制中重现了95%的共识结论，在前瞻性比较中与专家达成95%方向一致；小型专家小组在应用部署中达成>90%共识覆盖。

Conclusion: HAH-Delphi框架为生成高质量、情境敏感的共识提供了灵活且可扩展的方法，适用于健康、教练和绩效科学等领域。

Abstract: Expert consensus plays a critical role in domains where evidence is complex,
conflicting, or insufficient for direct prescription. Traditional methods, such
as Delphi studies, consensus conferences, and systematic guideline synthesis,
offer structure but face limitations including high panel burden, interpretive
oversimplification, and suppression of conditional nuance. These challenges are
now exacerbated by information overload, fragmentation of the evidence base,
and increasing reliance on publicly available sources that lack expert
filtering. This study introduces and evaluates a Human-AI Hybrid Delphi
(HAH-Delphi) framework designed to augment expert consensus development by
integrating a generative AI model (Gemini 2.5 Pro), small panels of senior
human experts, and structured facilitation. The HAH-Delphi was tested in three
phases: retrospective replication, prospective comparison, and applied
deployment in two applied domains (endurance training and resistance and mixed
cardio/strength training). The AI replicated 95% of published expert consensus
conclusions in Phase I and showed 95% directional agreement with senior human
experts in Phase II, though it lacked experiential and pragmatic nuance. In
Phase III, compact panels of six senior experts achieved >90% consensus
coverage and reached thematic saturation before the final participant. The AI
provided consistent, literature-grounded scaffolding that supported divergence
resolution and accelerated saturation. The HAH-Delphi framework offers a
flexible, scalable approach for generating high-quality, context-sensitive
consensus. Its successful application across health, coaching, and performance
science confirms its methodological robustness and supports its use as a
foundation for generating conditional, personalised guidance and published
consensus frameworks at scale.

### [6] [Flow-SLM: Joint Learning of Linguistic and Acoustic Information for Spoken Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09350)
*Ju-Chieh Chou,Jiawei Zhou,Karen Livescu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合建模语言和声学信息的文本无关语音生成模型，通过生成语义标记和连续声学帧表示，提升了声学细节的控制能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本无关语音模型仅预测语义标记，依赖外部声码器添加声学信息，缺乏声学上下文和控制能力。

Method: 使用流匹配目标预测连续声学向量，同时生成语义标记，并探索了预测多个未来语义标记的设计。

Result: 在语言似然基准测试中表现与现有模型相当，但在提示生成中提供了更好的声学细节。

Conclusion: 联合建模语言和声学信息的方法在保持语言性能的同时，显著提升了声学细节的表现。

Abstract: Textless spoken language models (SLMs) are generative models of speech that
do not rely on text supervision. Most textless SLMs learn to predict the next
semantic token, a discrete representation of linguistic content, and rely on a
separate vocoder to add acoustic information to the generated speech. Such
models have no access to acoustic context and no built-in control over acoustic
details. In this work, we propose to jointly model linguistic and acoustic
information by generating semantic tokens and a continuous real-valued
representation of the acoustic frame. We use a flow-matching objective to
predict the continuous vector conditioned on the semantic tokens. We study the
design space of this approach and find that predicting multiple future semantic
tokens helps preserve linguistic information. Our approach achieves comparable
performance to existing models in terms of linguistic likelihood benchmarks,
while providing better acoustic detail in prompted generation.

### [7] [APIO: Automatic Prompt Induction and Optimization for Grammatical Error Correction and Text Simplification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09378)
*Artem Chernodub,Aman Saini,Yejin Huh,Vivek Kulkarni,Vipul Raheja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: APIO是一种无需依赖手动指定种子提示的自动提示诱导和优化方法，用于语法错误纠正和文本简化任务，并在这些任务中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的进步使得通过简单的基于提示的交互完成多种自然语言处理任务成为可能，但如何优化提示以提升模型性能仍需研究。

Method: 提出了APIO方法，一种自动提示诱导和优化方法，不依赖手动指定的种子提示，专注于语法错误纠正和文本简化任务。

Result: APIO在语法错误纠正和文本简化任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: APIO是一种简单但有效的自动提示优化方法，为LLM在特定任务中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled a wide range
of natural language processing (NLP) tasks to be performed through simple
prompt-based interactions. Consequently, several approaches have been proposed
to engineer prompts that most effectively enable LLMs to perform a given task
(e.g., chain-of-thought prompting). In settings with a well-defined metric to
optimize model performance, automatic prompt optimization (APO) methods have
been developed to refine a seed prompt. Advancing this line of research, we
propose APIO, a simple but effective prompt induction and optimization approach
for the tasks of Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) and Text Simplification,
without relying on manually specified seed prompts. APIO achieves a new
state-of-the-art performance for purely LLM-based prompting methods on these
tasks. We make our data, code, prompts, and outputs publicly available.

### [8] [Columbo: Expanding Abbreviated Column Names for Tabular Data Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09403)
*Ting Cai,Stephen Sheen,AnHai Doan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Columbo，一种基于LLM的解决方案，用于扩展表格中的缩写列名，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决表格中缩写列名扩展的问题，对企业和科学领域的数据任务至关重要。

Method: 引入4个新数据集，提出新的同义词感知准确度测量方法，开发基于LLM的Columbo解决方案。

Result: Columbo在5个数据集上比当前最先进方法NameGuess性能提升4-29%。

Conclusion: Columbo在实际应用中表现优异，已用于环境科学数据门户EDI。

Abstract: Expanding the abbreviated column names of tables, such as ``esal'' to
``employee salary'', is critical for numerous downstream data tasks. This
problem arises in enterprises, domain sciences, government agencies, and more.
In this paper we make three contributions that significantly advances the state
of the art. First, we show that synthetic public data used by prior work has
major limitations, and we introduce 4 new datasets in enterprise/science
domains, with real-world abbreviations. Second, we show that accuracy measures
used by prior work seriously undercount correct expansions, and we propose new
synonym-aware measures that capture accuracy much more accurately. Finally, we
develop Columbo, a powerful LLM-based solution that exploits context, rules,
chain-of-thought reasoning, and token-level analysis. Extensive experiments
show that Columbo significantly outperforms NameGuess, the current most
advanced solution, by 4-29\%, over 5 datasets. Columbo has been used in
production on EDI, a major data portal for environmental sciences.

### [9] [Leveraging Zipformer Model for Effective Language Identification in Code-Switched Child-Directed Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09430)
*Lavanya Shankar,Leibny Paola Garcia Perera*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出使用Zipformer处理双语（普通话和英语）不平衡的语音数据，证明其内部层能有效编码语言特征，提升语言识别的平衡准确率至81.89%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决双语环境中儿童导向场景下语言识别和代码转换的挑战，尤其是数据不平衡问题。

Method: 利用Zipformer的内部层提取语言特征嵌入，并与不同后端进行比较。

Result: Zipformer在语言识别中表现稳健，平衡准确率（BAC）达到81.89%，比基线提升15.47%。

Conclusion: Transformer编码器架构模型在实际场景中具有潜力，尤其在处理不平衡数据时表现优异。

Abstract: Code-switching and language identification in child-directed scenarios
present significant challenges, particularly in bilingual environments. This
paper addresses this challenge by using Zipformer to handle the nuances of
speech, which contains two imbalanced languages, Mandarin and English, in an
utterance. This work demonstrates that the internal layers of the Zipformer
effectively encode the language characteristics, which can be leveraged in
language identification. We present the selection methodology of the inner
layers to extract the embeddings and make a comparison with different
back-ends. Our analysis shows that Zipformer is robust across these backends.
Our approach effectively handles imbalanced data, achieving a Balanced Accuracy
(BAC) of 81.89%, a 15.47% improvement over the language identification
baseline. These findings highlight the potential of the transformer encoder
architecture model in real scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型视觉语言模型（VLMs）在生成图表摘要时会放大地理经济偏见，高收入国家的描述更积极，而中低收入国家则相反。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨VLMs在图表摘要任务中可能存在的偏见及其社会影响。

Method: 对6,000个图表-国家组合进行大规模评估，分析不同经济地位国家的摘要情感倾向。

Result: 现有VLMs对高收入国家的描述更积极，且提示去偏技术效果有限。

Conclusion: 需开发更鲁棒的去偏策略以解决VLMs的地理经济偏见问题。

Abstract: Charts are very common for exploring data and communicating insights, but
extracting key takeaways from charts and articulating them in natural language
can be challenging. The chart-to-text task aims to automate this process by
generating textual summaries of charts. While with the rapid advancement of
large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we have witnessed great progress in this
domain, little to no attention has been given to potential biases in their
outputs. This paper investigates how VLMs can amplify geo-economic biases when
generating chart summaries, potentially causing societal harm. Specifically, we
conduct a large-scale evaluation of geo-economic biases in VLM-generated chart
summaries across 6,000 chart-country pairs from six widely used proprietary and
open-source models to understand how a country's economic status influences the
sentiment of generated summaries. Our analysis reveals that existing VLMs tend
to produce more positive descriptions for high-income countries compared to
middle- or low-income countries, even when country attribution is the only
variable changed. We also find that models such as GPT-4o-mini,
Gemini-1.5-Flash, and Phi-3.5 exhibit varying degrees of bias. We further
explore inference-time prompt-based debiasing techniques using positive
distractors but find them only partially effective, underscoring the complexity
of the issue and the need for more robust debiasing strategies. Our code and
dataset are publicly available here.

*Qi Jia,Xiujie Song,Zicheng Zhang,Yijin Guo,Kaiwei Zhang,Zijian Chen,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种用户中心的主观排行榜（USL），通过偏好驱动的动态排名帮助用户选择适合的LLM，并引入了可定制奖励模型（CRM）以解决人类偏好的多样性和矛盾性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM基准主要关注可验证任务，对实际用户需求帮助有限，因此需要一种更贴近用户偏好的评估方法。

Method: 基于10K+主观查询数据，开发了可定制奖励模型（CRM），并在USL中实现动态排名。

Result: CRM仅需4B参数即超越GPT-4.1和Gemini-2.5-pro，表现出卓越的泛化能力，USL能有效处理矛盾偏好。

Conclusion: USL和CRM为LLM选择提供了更实用的工具，解决了传统基准的局限性。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) predominantely focus on
assessing their capabilities through verifiable tasks. Such objective and
static benchmarks offer limited utility for practical LLM selection, making it
difficult for users to find suitable models for their individual needs. To
bridge this gap, we present the first User-Centric Subjective Leaderboard
(USL), which provides a preference-driven, dynamic ranking of LLMs across
diverse real-world scenarios. Our work is built upon a thorough investigation
of real human preference data, involving more than 10K subjective queries. Our
investigation reveals significant diversity and contradictions in human
preferences, which limit the effectiveness of state-of-the-art reward models.
To address this, we introduce Customizable Reward Models (CRMs). With only 4B
parameters, our CRM surpasses the performance of leading models such as GPT-4.1
and Gemini-2.5-pro, showing exceptional generalization capabilities across new
topics and criteria. The USL, powered by CRMs, exhibits strong negative
correlations to contradictory preferences.

### [12] [Learning Facts at Scale with Active Reading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09494)
*Jessy Lin,Vincent-Pierre Berges,Xilun Chen,Wen-Tau Yih,Gargi Ghosh,Barlas Oğuz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Active Reading框架，通过自生成学习策略训练模型，显著提升知识吸收能力，优于传统微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在知识学习和记忆上的不可靠性问题，提供工具确保模型能可靠学习给定知识。

Method: 提出Active Reading框架，训练模型通过自生成策略学习特定材料，应用于专家领域和预训练规模。

Result: 在SimpleQA和FinanceBench上分别提升313%和160%，并发布Meta WikiExpert-8B模型，性能优于更大规模模型。

Conclusion: Active Reading能有效提升模型知识吸收能力，适用于专家领域和预训练，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: LLMs are known to store vast amounts of knowledge in their parametric memory.
However, learning and recalling facts from this memory is known to be
unreliable, depending largely on the prevalence of particular facts in the
training data and other factors which are poorly understood. Practitioners are
lacking tools which will allow them to ensure that the models learn a given
body of knowledge reliably and consistently. To this end, we propose Active
Reading: a framework where we train models to study a given set of material
with self-generated learning strategies. First, we demonstrate models trained
with Active Reading on expert domains absorb significantly more knowledge than
vanilla finetuning and other data augmentations. We train expert 8B models that
achieve 66% on a Wikipedia-grounded subset of SimpleQA (+313% relative over
vanilla finetuning) and 26% on FinanceBench (+160% relative over vanilla
finetuning) by applying Active Reading to the source documents for each
benchmark. Finally, we show that Active Reading can be utilized at pre-training
scale to build more factual models. As a demonstration of this, we release Meta
WikiExpert-8B, a Wikipedia-expert model trained on 1 trillion generated tokens,
which outcompetes models with hundreds of billions of parameters on factual QA.

### [13] [From Ranking to Selection: A Simple but Efficient Dynamic Passage Selector for Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09497)
*Siyuan Meng,Junming Liu,Yirong Chen,Song Mao,Pinlong Cai,Guohang Yan,Botian Shi,Ding Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态段落选择器（DPS），通过监督学习解决RAG系统中固定Top-K选择的问题，显著提升了多跳查询的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统的重排序模块在处理多跳查询时存在固定Top-K选择的局限性，导致信息遗漏或噪声引入。

Method: DPS将段落选择视为监督学习问题，捕捉段落间依赖关系并动态选择最相关段落。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，DPS表现优于现有方法，尤其在MuSiQue数据集上F1分数提升显著。

Conclusion: DPS通过自适应证据选择，显著提升了复杂RAG场景下的推理能力。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are often bottlenecked by their
reranking modules, which typically score passages independently and select a
fixed Top-K size. This approach struggles with complex multi-hop queries that
require synthesizing evidence across multiple documents, creating a trade-off
where small K values omit crucial information and large K values introduce
noise. To address this, we introduce the Dynamic Passage Selector (DPS), a
novel reranking framework that treats passage selection as a supervised
learning problem. Unlike traditional point-wise or list-wise methods, DPS is
fine-tuned to capture inter-passage dependencies and dynamically select the
most relevant set of passages for generation. As a seamless plug-and-play
module, DPS requires no modifications to the standard RAG pipeline.
Comprehensive evaluations on five benchmarks show that DPS consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art rerankers and fine-tuning methods. Notably, on the
challenging MuSiQue dataset, DPS improves the F1-score by 30.06% and 15.4% over
strong baselines like Qwen3-reranker and RankingGPT, respectively. Our results
demonstrate that by enabling adaptive evidence selection, DPS substantially
enhances reasoning capabilities in complex RAG scenarios.

*Jakub Šmíd,Pavel Přibáň,Pavel Král*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用大语言模型（LLM）生成高质量伪标签数据的方法，用于跨语言方面级情感分析（ABSA），无需依赖翻译工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖不可靠的翻译工具，无法有效解决跨语言ABSA问题。

Method: 通过LLM生成伪标签数据，并进一步微调ABSA模型。

Result: 在六种语言和五种骨干模型上验证了方法的有效性，超越了基于翻译的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法支持生成式模型，微调后的LLM表现优于小型多语言模型。

Abstract: Cross-lingual aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) involves detailed
sentiment analysis in a target language by transferring knowledge from a source
language with available annotated data. Most existing methods depend heavily on
often unreliable translation tools to bridge the language gap. In this paper,
we propose a new approach that leverages a large language model (LLM) to
generate high-quality pseudo-labelled data in the target language without the
need for translation tools. First, the framework trains an ABSA model to obtain
predictions for unlabelled target language data. Next, LLM is prompted to
generate natural sentences that better represent these noisy predictions than
the original text. The ABSA model is then further fine-tuned on the resulting
pseudo-labelled dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method across
six languages and five backbone models, surpassing previous state-of-the-art
translation-based approaches. The proposed framework also supports generative
models, and we show that fine-tuned LLMs outperform smaller multilingual
models.

*Jakub Šmíd,Pavel Král*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文综述了跨语言基于方面的情感分析（ABSA），填补了该领域缺乏系统性研究的空白，总结了任务、数据集、方法及未来方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨语言ABSA研究较少，缺乏系统性综述，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 综述了ABSA任务（如方面词提取、情感分类）、数据集、建模范式及跨语言迁移方法，并探讨了单语、多语和LLM在ABSA中的作用。

Result: 总结了跨语言ABSA的现状、挑战及现有方法的贡献。

Conclusion: 提出了未来研究方向，以推动跨语言ABSA系统的发展。

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained sentiment analysis
task that focuses on understanding opinions at the aspect level, including
sentiment towards specific aspect terms, categories, and opinions. While ABSA
research has seen significant progress, much of the focus has been on
monolingual settings. Cross-lingual ABSA, which aims to transfer knowledge from
resource-rich languages (such as English) to low-resource languages, remains an
under-explored area, with no systematic review of the field. This paper aims to
fill that gap by providing a comprehensive survey of cross-lingual ABSA. We
summarize key ABSA tasks, including aspect term extraction, aspect sentiment
classification, and compound tasks involving multiple sentiment elements.
Additionally, we review the datasets, modelling paradigms, and cross-lingual
transfer methods used to solve these tasks. We also examine how existing work
in monolingual and multilingual ABSA, as well as ABSA with LLMs, contributes to
the development of cross-lingual ABSA. Finally, we highlight the main
challenges and suggest directions for future research to advance cross-lingual
ABSA systems.

Motivation: 解决事实核查中高效检索相关声明的需求，尤其是在多语言环境下。

Method: 使用多种大语言模型生成文本嵌入，结合模型提升效果，通过余弦相似度匹配最相关声明。

Result: 在单语言任务中排名第7，跨语言任务中排名第9，NVIDIA NV-Embed-v2模型表现最佳。

Conclusion: 多模型结合和文本嵌入方法在事实核查任务中有效，但多语言模型表现不佳，需依赖英语翻译。

Abstract: This paper presents a zero-shot system for fact-checked claim retrieval. We
employed several state-of-the-art large language models to obtain text
embeddings. The models were then combined to obtain the best possible result.
Our approach achieved 7th place in monolingual and 9th in cross-lingual
subtasks. We used only English translations as an input to the text embedding
models since multilingual models did not achieve satisfactory results. We
identified the most relevant claims for each post by leveraging the embeddings
and measuring cosine similarity. Overall, the best results were obtained by the
NVIDIA NV-Embed-v2 model. For some languages, we benefited from model
combinations (NV-Embed & GPT or Mistral).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前情感支持模型缺乏基于心理学原理的深度共情推理，需改进以提升情感支持能力。

Method: 结合自然语言推理与结构化心理学步骤，构建细粒度数据集，采用强化学习与统一过程-结果奖励模型，引入基于个性的对话重写和冗余感知奖励重加权策略。

Result: 显著提升了模型的情感支持能力，推动了共情、类人支持系统的发展。

Conclusion: 该方法通过可控共情推理和强化学习，有效提升了情感支持模型的性能，为共情系统的发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Emotional support conversations are crucial for promoting emotional
well-being, yet current models often lack deep empathetic reasoning grounded in
psychological principles. To address this, we propose controllable empathetic
reasoning, which combines natural language reasoning with structured
psychological steps. We construct a fine-grained dataset annotated with
reasoning correctness and response preferences to enable this capability. To
further enhance training, we employ reinforcement learning with a unified
process-outcome reward model that delivers precise feedback. To mitigate
response repetitiveness from entropy collapse, we introduce personality-based
dialogue rewriting and a redundancy-aware reward reweighting strategy. Our
approach significantly improves model's emotional support ability, advancing
the development of empathetic, human-like support systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为N-Gram Coverage Attack的成员推理攻击方法，仅依赖目标模型的文本输出，适用于黑盒模型。该方法通过n-gram重叠度量计算生成文本与候选成员文本的相似性，性能优于其他黑盒方法，甚至媲美白盒攻击。实验表明，攻击性能随计算预算增加而提升，并发现GPT-4o等新模型对成员推理攻击更具鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前许多成员推理攻击需要访问模型的隐藏状态或概率分布，限制了其在仅API访问的模型（如GPT-4）上的应用。本文旨在开发一种仅依赖文本输出的攻击方法，以扩展攻击范围。

Method: 提出N-Gram Coverage Attack，通过生成多个条件文本并计算其与候选成员文本的n-gram重叠度量，判断成员资格。

Result: 该方法在现有基准测试中优于其他黑盒方法，性能接近或超过白盒攻击。攻击性能随生成序列数量增加而提升。GPT-4o等新模型表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: N-Gram Coverage Attack是一种高效的黑盒成员推理攻击方法，适用于广泛模型。新模型在隐私保护方面有所改进。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks serves as useful tool for fair use of language
models, such as detecting potential copyright infringement and auditing data
leakage. However, many current state-of-the-art attacks require access to
models' hidden states or probability distribution, which prevents investigation
into more widely-used, API-access only models like GPT-4. In this work, we
introduce N-Gram Coverage Attack, a membership inference attack that relies
solely on text outputs from the target model, enabling attacks on completely
black-box models. We leverage the observation that models are more likely to
memorize and subsequently generate text patterns that were commonly observed in
their training data. Specifically, to make a prediction on a candidate member,
N-Gram Coverage Attack first obtains multiple model generations conditioned on
a prefix of the candidate. It then uses n-gram overlap metrics to compute and
aggregate the similarities of these outputs with the ground truth suffix; high
similarities indicate likely membership. We first demonstrate on a diverse set
of existing benchmarks that N-Gram Coverage Attack outperforms other black-box
methods while also impressively achieving comparable or even better performance
to state-of-the-art white-box attacks - despite having access to only text
outputs. Interestingly, we find that the success rate of our method scales with
the attack compute budget - as we increase the number of sequences generated
from the target model conditioned on the prefix, attack performance tends to
improve. Having verified the accuracy of our method, we use it to investigate
previously unstudied closed OpenAI models on multiple domains. We find that
more recent models, such as GPT-4o, exhibit increased robustness to membership
inference, suggesting an evolving trend toward improved privacy protections.

Conclusion: AINL-Eval 2025为持续研究提供了平台和数据集，推动了AI生成内容检测的长期进展。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized text
generation, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish between human- and
AI-generated content. This poses a significant challenge to academic integrity,
particularly in scientific publishing and multilingual contexts where detection
resources are often limited. To address this critical gap, we introduce the
AINL-Eval 2025 Shared Task, specifically focused on the detection of
AI-generated scientific abstracts in Russian. We present a novel, large-scale
dataset comprising 52,305 samples, including human-written abstracts across 12
diverse scientific domains and AI-generated counterparts from five
state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4-Turbo, Gemma2-27B, Llama3.3-70B, Deepseek-V3, and
GigaChat-Lite). A core objective of the task is to challenge participants to
develop robust solutions capable of generalizing to both (i) previously unseen
scientific domains and (ii) models not included in the training data. The task
was organized in two phases, attracting 10 teams and 159 submissions, with top
systems demonstrating strong performance in identifying AI-generated content.
We also establish a continuous shared task platform to foster ongoing research
and long-term progress in this important area. The dataset and platform are

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了通过调整解码温度来增加语言模型多样性的方法，发现降低温度可提高质量（精确度），而提高温度未必能提升覆盖率（召回率）。作者提出通过重新设计损失函数，利用精确度-召回率框架，实现更好的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过调整解码温度来优化语言模型的多样性与质量，发现传统方法在覆盖率上的不足，需改进损失函数设计。

Method: 分析温度调整对模型性能的影响，提出基于精确度-召回率框架的损失函数设计方法。

Result: 新方法在精确度与召回率之间实现了更好的权衡，优于传统的负对数似然训练结合温度缩放。

Conclusion: 重新设计损失函数可为语言模型提供更优的多样性与质量平衡，推动更稳健的建模技术。

Abstract: Increasing diversity in language models is a challenging yet essential
objective. A common approach is to raise the decoding temperature. In this
work, we investigate this approach through a simplistic yet common case to
provide insights into why decreasing temperature can improve quality
(Precision), while increasing it often fails to boost coverage (Recall). Our
analysis reveals that for a model to be effectively tunable through temperature
adjustments, it must be trained toward coverage. To address this, we propose
rethinking loss functions in language models by leveraging the Precision-Recall
framework. Our results demonstrate that this approach achieves a substantially
better trade-off between Precision and Recall than merely combining negative
log-likelihood training with temperature scaling. These findings offer a
pathway toward more versatile and robust language modeling techniques.

TL;DR: EffiEval是一种无需训练的高效基准测试方法，通过自适应选择高质量代表性子集，解决了数据冗余问题，同时保持高评估可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的快速发展与评估基准的多样化和规模扩大带来了巨大的计算挑战，需要一种高效且可靠的评估方法。

Method: EffiEval基于模型效用指数（MUI）自适应选择代表性子集，满足代表性、公平性和通用性三大标准。

Result: 在多个公共基准和多样LLMs上的实验表明，EffiEval仅用少量数据即可实现与全数据集评估一致的排名结果。

Conclusion: EffiEval为LLMs时代提供了一种实用、通用且高效的评估解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and the development of
increasingly large and diverse evaluation benchmarks have introduced
substantial computational challenges for model assessment. In this paper, we
present EffiEval, a training-free approach for efficient benchmarking that
effectively addresses data redundancy while maintaining high evaluation
reliability. Our method is specifically designed to meet three key criteria for
high-quality evaluation: representativeness, by ensuring comprehensive coverage
of model capabilities; fairness, by remaining independent of model performance
during sample selection to avoid bias; and generalizability, by enabling
flexible transfer across datasets and model families without reliance on
large-scale evaluation data. Unlike traditional methods that rely on absolute
performance or require extensive evaluation data, our approach adaptively
selects high-quality representative subsets based on the Model Utility Index
(MUI). Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks and diverse LLMs
demonstrate that EffiEval achieves strong ranking consistency with full-dataset
evaluation using only a small fraction of the original data. Furthermore, our
method is flexible and scalable in size, allowing users to balance evaluation
efficiency and representativeness according to specific needs. Overall,
EffiEval provides a practical and generalizable solution for reliable, fair,
and efficient evaluation in the era of LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SLowED的安全蒸馏方法，通过Slow Tuning和Low-Entropy Masking模块，在提升小语言模型推理能力的同时保持其安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有链式思维蒸馏方法在提升小语言模型推理能力时忽视了其安全性问题，本文旨在解决这一缺陷。

Method: 提出SLowED方法，包含Slow Tuning（限制权重变化幅度）和Low-Entropy Masking（屏蔽低熵标记）两个模块。

Result: 实验表明SLowED在保持安全性的同时提升了推理能力，优于现有蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: SLowED通过平衡安全性和推理能力，为小语言模型的蒸馏提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Previous chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation methods primarily focused on
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Small Language Models (SLMs) by
utilizing high-quality rationales generated by powerful Large Language Models
(LLMs, e.g., GPT-4). However, few works have noted the negative effects on SLM
safety brought by the training, which are revealed in this study. Although
there are works on safety alignment that fine-tune language models or
manipulate model weights to defend against harmful inputs, they require extra
computation or annotated data, and probably impact the reasoning ability of
SLMs. In this paper, we investigate how to maintain the safety of SLMs during
the CoT distillation process. Specifically, we propose a safe distillation
method, Slow Tuning and Low-Entropy Masking Distillation (SLowED), containing
two modules: Slow Tuning and Low-Entropy Masking. Slow Tuning scales down the
magnitude of model weight changes to optimize the model weights in the
neighboring space near the initial weight distribution. Low-Entropy Masking
masks low-entropy tokens, which are regarded as unnecessary learning targets,
to exclude them from fine-tuning. Experiments on three SLMs (Qwen2.5-1.5B,
Llama-3.2-1B, BLOOM-1.1B) across reasoning benchmarks (BBH, BB-Sub, ARC,
AGIEval) and safety evaluation (AdvBench) show that SLowED retains the safety
of SLMs and comparably improves their reasoning capability compared to existing
distillation methods. Furthermore, our ablation study presents the
effectiveness of Slow Tuning and Low-Entropy Masking, with the former
maintaining the model's safety in the early stage and the latter prolonging the
safe training epochs.

Motivation: 探讨AI在法律职业中的应用潜力，特别是LLM在关键法律任务中的能力。

Method: 通过调查实验，比较LLM与初级律师在法律任务中的表现，由高级法学院学生评估。

Result: LLM在法律起草和问题发现上表现优异，但在专业研究和推理中常出现错误。

Conclusion: LLM可辅助部分法律任务，但人类专业知识在复杂推理和法律精确应用上仍不可或缺。

Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence(AI) into the legal profession
raises significant questions about the capacity of Large Language Models(LLM)
to perform key legal tasks. In this paper, I empirically evaluate how well
LLMs, such as GPT, Claude, and Llama, perform key legal tasks in the Indian
context, including issue spotting, legal drafting, advice, research, and
reasoning. Through a survey experiment, I compare outputs from LLMs with those
of a junior lawyer, with advanced law students rating the work on helpfulness,
accuracy, and comprehensiveness. LLMs excel in drafting and issue spotting,
often matching or surpassing human work. However, they struggle with
specialised legal research, frequently generating hallucinations, factually
incorrect or fabricated outputs. I conclude that while LLMs can augment certain
legal tasks, human expertise remains essential for nuanced reasoning and the
precise application of law.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了视觉语言模型（VLMs）对误导性信息可视化的解读能力，发现大多数模型容易被欺骗，导致对图表的错误理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信息可视化可能包含欺骗性设计元素，误导用户并传播错误信息。随着VLMs被广泛用于解读可视化，尤其是非专业用户，了解这些模型对误导性设计的敏感性至关重要。

Method: 通过分析16,000多个来自10种不同模型对8种误导性图表设计的响应，评估VLMs的解读能力。

Result: 大多数VLMs被误导性设计欺骗，导致对图表的错误解读，尽管数据本身未变。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在VLMs中建立针对视觉错误信息的鲁棒防护机制的必要性。

Abstract: Information visualizations are powerful tools that help users quickly
identify patterns, trends, and outliers, facilitating informed decision-making.
However, when visualizations incorporate deceptive design elements-such as
truncated or inverted axes, unjustified 3D effects, or violations of best
practices-they can mislead viewers and distort understanding, spreading
misinformation. While some deceptive tactics are obvious, others subtly
manipulate perception while maintaining a facade of legitimacy. As
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly used to interpret
visualizations, especially by non-expert users, it is critical to understand
how susceptible these models are to deceptive visual designs. In this study, we
conduct an in-depth evaluation of VLMs' ability to interpret misleading
visualizations. By analyzing over 16,000 responses from ten different models
across eight distinct types of misleading chart designs, we demonstrate that
most VLMs are deceived by them. This leads to altered interpretations of
charts, despite the underlying data remaining the same. Our findings highlight
the need for robust safeguards in VLMs against visual misinformation.

TL;DR: GFPO（Group Filtered Policy Optimization）通过训练时采样更多组并基于响应长度和令牌效率筛选，减少语言模型为追求准确性而过度延长响应的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在强化学习中倾向于通过增加响应长度来提高准确性，导致冗余文本增多。

Method: GFPO通过采样更多训练组，并基于长度和令牌效率（奖励/令牌比）筛选响应，优化训练。还提出自适应难度GFPO，动态分配资源。

Result: 在Phi-4模型上，GFPO将长度膨胀减少46-71%，优化令牌效率后可达71-85%，同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: GFPO通过增加训练计算减少推理计算，实现高效推理的简单有效权衡。

Abstract: Large language models trained with reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards tend to trade accuracy for length--inflating response lengths to
achieve gains in accuracy. While longer answers may be warranted for harder
problems, many tokens are merely "filler": repetitive, verbose text that makes
no real progress. We introduce GFPO (Group Filtered Policy Optimization), which
curbs this length explosion by sampling larger groups per problem during
training and filtering responses to train on based on two key metrics: (1)
response length and (2) token efficiency: reward per token ratio. By sampling
more at training time, we teach models to think less at inference time. On the
Phi-4-reasoning model, GFPO cuts GRPO's length inflation by 46-71% across
challenging STEM and coding benchmarks (AIME 24/25, GPQA, Omni-MATH,
LiveCodeBench) while maintaining accuracy. Optimizing for reward per token
further increases reductions in length inflation to 71-85%. We also propose
Adaptive Difficulty GFPO, which dynamically allocates more training resources
to harder problems based on real-time difficulty estimates, improving the
balance between computational efficiency and accuracy especially on difficult
questions. GFPO demonstrates that increased training-time compute directly
translates to reduced test-time compute--a simple yet effective trade-off for
efficient reasoning.

Motivation: 解决多跳问答中查询模糊性问题，提升检索增强生成的效果。

Method: 1. 使用大语言模型（LLM）分解多跳问题为单跳子问题；2. 生成可回答问题嵌入文档块，通过问题-问题相似度检索。

Result: 在三个多跳问答数据集上表现优于基线系统。

Conclusion: 可回答问题嵌入和LLM查询分解在多跳RAG中效果显著。

Abstract: We introduce a novel retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework tailored
for multihop question answering. First, our system uses large language model
(LLM) to decompose complex multihop questions into a sequence of single-hop
subquestions that guide document retrieval. This decomposition mitigates the
ambiguity inherent in multi-hop queries by clearly targeting distinct knowledge
facets. Second, instead of embedding raw or chunked documents directly, we
generate answerable questions from each document chunk using Qwen3-8B, embed
these generated questions, and retrieve relevant chunks via question-question
embedding similarity. During inference, the retrieved chunks are then fed along
with the original question into the RAG pipeline. We evaluate on three multihop
question datasets (MuSiQue, 2WikiMultiHopQa, HotpotQA) from LongBench. Our
method improves RAG performacne compared to baseline systems. Our contributions
highlight the benefits of using answerable-question embeddings for RAG, and the
effectiveness of LLM-based query decomposition for multihop scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨提示词对LLMs政治偏见评估的影响，以理解模型行为的鲁棒性及其与观点性文本的互动。

Method: 在支持与反驳论点存在的情况下进行政治偏见实验，分析单轮和多轮对话中模型响应的变化。

Result: 论点显著改变模型响应方向，论点强度影响模型的一致性，表明LLMs存在迎合倾向。

Conclusion: LLMs倾向于根据提示论点调整立场，这对政治偏见的测量和缓解策略有重要影响。

Abstract: There have been numerous studies evaluating bias of LLMs towards political
topics. However, how positions towards these topics in model outputs are highly
sensitive to the prompt. What happens when the prompt itself is suggestive of
certain arguments towards those positions remains underexplored. This is
crucial for understanding how robust these bias evaluations are and for
understanding model behaviour, as these models frequently interact with
opinionated text. To that end, we conduct experiments for political bias
evaluation in presence of supporting and refuting arguments. Our experiments
show that such arguments substantially alter model responses towards the
direction of the provided argument in both single-turn and multi-turn settings.
Moreover, we find that the strength of these arguments influences the
directional agreement rate of model responses. These effects point to a
sycophantic tendency in LLMs adapting their stance to align with the presented
arguments which has downstream implications for measuring political bias and
developing effective mitigation strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM架构在TTS模型中实现了高自然度，但在处理G2P映射和韵律时仍存在挑战，尤其是缺乏显式G2P模块时。

Method: 采用低秩适应技术，针对日语语音在音素级别控制发音和音高重音，同时保持零样本设置下的自然度和说话人相似性。

Result: 主客观评估验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: UtterTune在提升目标语言发音可控性的同时，不影响其他语言的性能。

Abstract: We propose UtterTune, a lightweight adaptation method that fine-tunes a
multilingual text-to-speech (TTS) system based on a large language model (LLM)
architecture, designed to enhance the controllability of pronunciation in a
target language while preserving performance in others. While LLM architectures
have enabled TTS models to achieve remarkable naturalness, accurately modeling
grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) mapping and prosody remains challenging, especially
when the model omits an explicit G2P module and directly processes minimally
encoded text (e.g., byte-pair encoding). UtterTune leverages low-rank
adaptation to enable the control of segmental pronunciation and pitch accent at
the phoneme level for Japanese speech, the target language in this paper, while
maintaining naturalness and speaker similarity in a zero-shot setting.
Objective and subjective evaluations confirm its effectiveness.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of Explainable Natural Language Processing
(NLP), textual explanations, i.e., human-like rationales, are pivotal for
explaining model predictions and enriching datasets with interpretable labels.
Traditional approaches rely on human annotation, which is costly,
labor-intensive, and impedes scalability. In this work, we present an automated
framework that leverages multiple state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs)
to generate high-quality textual explanations. We rigorously assess the quality
of these LLM-generated explanations using a comprehensive suite of Natural
Language Generation (NLG) metrics. Furthermore, we investigate the downstream
impact of these explanations on the performance of pre-trained language models
(PLMs) and LLMs across natural language inference tasks on two diverse
benchmark datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that automated explanations
exhibit highly competitive effectiveness compared to human-annotated
explanations in improving model performance. Our findings underscore a
promising avenue for scalable, automated LLM-based textual explanation
generation for extending NLP datasets and enhancing model performance.

Conclusion: 研究强调需要清晰定义和用户中心框架，以促进可解释性NLP的实际应用。

Abstract: The field of explainable natural language processing (NLP) has grown rapidly
in recent years. The growing opacity of complex models calls for transparency
and explanations of their decisions, which is crucial to understand their
reasoning and facilitate deployment, especially in high-stakes environments.
Despite increasing attention given to explainable NLP, practitioners'
perspectives regarding its practical adoption and effectiveness remain
underexplored. This paper addresses this research gap by investigating
practitioners' experiences with explainability methods, specifically focusing
on their motivations for adopting such methods, the techniques employed,
satisfaction levels, and the practical challenges encountered in real-world NLP
applications. Through a qualitative interview-based study with industry
practitioners and complementary interviews with academic researchers, we
systematically analyze and compare their perspectives. Our findings reveal
conceptual gaps, low satisfaction with current explainability methods, and
highlight evaluation challenges. Our findings emphasize the need for clear
definitions and user-centric frameworks for better adoption of explainable NLP
in practice.

Result: BigCharts-R1模型在多个图表问答基准测试中超越了现有方法，包括更大的开源和闭源模型。

Conclusion: BigCharts数据集和训练框架显著提升了图表推理模型的性能，为图表理解任务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Charts are essential to data analysis, transforming raw data into clear
visual representations that support human decision-making. Although current
vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress, they continue to
struggle with chart comprehension due to training on datasets that lack
diversity and real-world authenticity, or on automatically extracted underlying
data tables of charts, which can contain numerous estimation errors.
Furthermore, existing models only rely on supervised fine-tuning using these
low-quality datasets, severely limiting their effectiveness. To address these
issues, we first propose BigCharts, a dataset creation pipeline that generates
visually diverse chart images by conditioning the rendering process on
real-world charts sourced from multiple online platforms. Unlike purely
synthetic datasets, BigCharts incorporates real-world data, ensuring
authenticity and visual diversity, while still retaining accurate underlying
data due to our proposed replotting process. Additionally, we introduce a
comprehensive training framework that integrates supervised fine-tuning with
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-based reinforcement learning. By
introducing novel reward signals specifically designed for chart reasoning, our
approach enhances model robustness and generalization across diverse chart
styles and domains, resulting in a state-of-the-art chart reasoning model,
BigCharts-R1. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our models surpass
existing methods on multiple chart question-answering benchmarks compared to
even larger open-source and closed-source models.

TL;DR: 本文综述了用于训练AI心理健康助手的临床数据集，分类并分析了现有数据的不足，提出了改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球心理健康问题日益严重，但临床资源不足，AI辅助成为解决方案，但高质量数据集缺乏阻碍了AI发展。

Method: 对现有临床心理健康数据集进行全面调查，按疾病、数据类型、任务、可访问性和文化背景分类，并分析合成数据。

Result: 发现数据集存在纵向数据不足、文化语言多样性低、标准不一致等问题。

Conclusion: 提出改进数据集质量和标准化的建议，以促进更稳健、公平的AI心理健康系统发展。

Abstract: Mental health disorders are rising worldwide. However, the availability of
trained clinicians has not scaled proportionally, leaving many people without
adequate or timely support. To bridge this gap, recent studies have shown the
promise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to assist mental health diagnosis,
monitoring, and intervention. However, the development of efficient, reliable,
and ethical AI to assist clinicians is heavily dependent on high-quality
clinical training datasets. Despite growing interest in data curation for
training clinical AI assistants, existing datasets largely remain scattered,
under-documented, and often inaccessible, hindering the reproducibility,
comparability, and generalizability of AI models developed for clinical mental
health care. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive survey of
clinical mental health datasets relevant to the training and development of
AI-powered clinical assistants. We categorize these datasets by mental
disorders (e.g., depression, schizophrenia), data modalities (e.g., text,
speech, physiological signals), task types (e.g., diagnosis prediction, symptom
severity estimation, intervention generation), accessibility (public,
restricted or private), and sociocultural context (e.g., language and cultural
background). Along with these, we also investigate synthetic clinical mental
health datasets. Our survey identifies critical gaps such as a lack of
longitudinal data, limited cultural and linguistic representation, inconsistent
collection and annotation standards, and a lack of modalities in synthetic
data. We conclude by outlining key challenges in curating and standardizing
future datasets and provide actionable recommendations to facilitate the
development of more robust, generalizable, and equitable mental health AI
systems.

Result: 提出了现代高效LLM架构的蓝图，为未来研究提供了方向。

Conclusion: 通过分类总结现有研究，本文为开发更高效、多功能的AI系统提供了参考和启发。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have delivered impressive results in language
understanding, generation, reasoning, and pushes the ability boundary of
multimodal models. Transformer models, as the foundation of modern LLMs, offer
a strong baseline with excellent scaling properties. However, the traditional
transformer architecture requires substantial computations and poses
significant obstacles for large-scale training and practical deployment. In
this survey, we offer a systematic examination of innovative LLM architectures
that address the inherent limitations of transformers and boost the efficiency.
Starting from language modeling, this survey covers the background and
technical details of linear and sparse sequence modeling methods, efficient
full attention variants, sparse mixture-of-experts, hybrid model architectures
incorporating the above techniques, and emerging diffusion LLMs. Additionally,
we discuss applications of these techniques to other modalities and consider
their wider implications for developing scalable, resource-aware foundation
models. By grouping recent studies into the above category, this survey
presents a blueprint of modern efficient LLM architectures, and we hope this
could help motivate future research toward more efficient, versatile AI
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准对长上下文和深度推理的需求不足，PRELUDE填补了这一空白，通过更复杂的任务评估模型能力。

Method: 提出PRELUDE任务，要求模型整合间接相关的多部分信息，评估其一致性和推理能力。实验包括上下文学习、RAG、领域训练和商业服务。

Result: 模型表现落后人类15%以上，且推理准确率差距超过30%，显示长上下文理解和推理仍有巨大改进空间。

Conclusion: PRELUDE揭示了当前模型在长上下文理解和推理上的不足，为未来研究提供了重要方向。

Abstract: We introduce PRELUDE, a benchmark for evaluating long-context understanding
through the task of determining whether a character's prequel story is
consistent with the canonical narrative of the original book. Our task poses a
stronger demand for global comprehension and deep reasoning than existing
benchmarks -- as the prequels are not part of the original story, assessing
their plausibility typically requires searching and integrating information
that is only indirectly related. Empirically, 88% of instances require evidence
from multiple parts of the narrative. Experimental results highlight the
challenge of our task: in-context learning, RAG and in-domain training with
state-of-the-art LLMs, and commercial DeepResearch services, lag behind humans
by >15%. A further human study reveals that models often produce correct
answers with flawed reasoning, leading to an over 30% gap in reasoning accuracy
compared to humans. These findings underscore the substantial room for
improvement in long-context understanding and reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了轻量级Whisper模型（Tiny、Base、Small）在低资源环境下用于乌尔都语语音识别的可行性，发现Whisper-Small表现最佳（33.68% WER），但仍存在语音准确性和词汇连贯性挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乌尔都语是全球第十大语言，但在自动语音识别（ASR）系统中代表性不足，主要由于方言多样性、代码转换和训练数据稀缺。

Method: 研究使用未经过微调的Whisper模型在乌尔都语数据集上进行基准测试，以词错误率（WER）为评估指标。

Result: Whisper-Small的WER最低（33.68%），优于Tiny（67.08%）和Base（53.67%），但在复杂语句中仍存在语音和词汇问题。

Conclusion: Whisper-Small显示出在乌尔都语ASR中的潜力，但仍需进一步研究以解决低资源环境下的挑战。

Abstract: This study evaluates the feasibility of lightweight Whisper models (Tiny,
Base, Small) for Urdu speech recognition in low-resource settings. Despite Urdu
being the 10th most spoken language globally with over 230 million speakers,
its representation in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems remains
limited due to dialectal diversity, code-switching, and sparse training data.
We benchmark these models on a curated Urdu dataset using word error rate
(WER), without fine-tuning. Results show Whisper-Small achieves the lowest
error rates (33.68\% WER), outperforming Tiny (67.08\% WER) and Base (53.67\%
WER). Qualitative analysis reveals persistent challenges in phonetic accuracy
and lexical coherence, particularly for complex utterances. While Whisper-Small
demonstrates promise for deployable Urdu ASR, significant gaps remain. Our
findings emphasize lay the groundwork for future research into effective,
low-resource ASR systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在特定领域适应中的高成本和灾难性遗忘问题，以及RAG方法的高延迟问题。

Method: 使用小型Transformer解码器模仿外部非参数检索器的行为，训练后可无缝集成到任何共享相同分词器的预训练模型中。

Result: 在生物医学、金融和法律三个领域，平均降低困惑度6.17点。

Conclusion: Memory Decoder为领域适应提供了一种新颖的即插即用范式，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong abilities in general language
tasks, yet adapting them to specific domains remains a challenge. Current
method like Domain Adaptive Pretraining (DAPT) requires costly full-parameter
training and suffers from catastrophic forgetting. Meanwhile,
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces substantial inference latency
due to expensive nearest-neighbor searches and longer context. This paper
introduces Memory Decoder, a plug-and-play pretrained memory that enables
efficient domain adaptation without changing the original model's parameters.
Memory Decoder employs a small transformer decoder that learns to imitate the
behavior of an external non-parametric retriever. Once trained, Memory Decoder
can be seamlessly integrated with any pretrained language model that shares the
same tokenizer, requiring no model-specific modifications. Experimental results
demonstrate that Memory Decoder enables effective adaptation of various Qwen
and Llama models to three distinct specialized domains: biomedicine, finance,
and law, reducing perplexity by an average of 6.17 points. Overall, Memory
Decoder introduces a novel paradigm centered on a specially pretrained memory
component designed for domain-specific adaptation. This memory architecture can
be integrated in a plug-and-play manner, consistently enhancing performance
across multiple models within the target domain.

Abstract: As interest grows in the application of natural language processing (NLP)
techniques to mental health, a growing body of work explores the automatic
detection and classification of cognitive distortions (CDs). CDs are habitual
patterns of negatively biased or flawed thinking that distort how people
perceive events, judge themselves, and react to the world around them.
Identifying and addressing them is an important part of therapy. Despite its
momentum, the field remains fragmented, with inconsistencies in CD taxonomies,
task formulations, and evaluation practices. This survey reviews 38 studies
spanning two decades, providing a structured overview of datasets, modelling
approaches, and evaluation strategies. We provide a consolidated CD taxonomy
reference, summarise common task setups, and highlight open challenges to
support more coherent and reproducible research in this emerging area.

Motivation: 数字化商业沟通既提高了透明度，也增加了欺骗的可能性，因此需要开发有效的欺骗性语言检测方法。

Method: 结合古典修辞学、心理学理论和语言学，利用计算文本分析和个性化Transformer模型进行检测。

Result: 在受控环境中检测准确率超过99%，但在多语言环境中因数据不足和基础设施缺乏而难以复现。

Conclusion: 需要开发更强大的自动文本识别系统，以应对AI与人类沟通中日益逼真的欺骗性语言。

Abstract: Business communication digitisation has reorganised the process of persuasive
discourse, which
  allows not only greater transparency but also advanced deception. This
inquiry synthesises classical
  rhetoric and communication psychology with linguistic theory and empirical
studies in the financial
  reporting, sustainability discourse, and digital marketing to explain how
deceptive language can be
  systematically detected using persuasive lexicon. In controlled settings,
detection accuracies of greater
  than 99% were achieved by using computational textual analysis as well as
personalised transformer
  models. However, reproducing this performance in multilingual settings is
also problematic and,
  to a large extent, this is because it is not easy to find sufficient data,
and because few multilingual
  text-processing infrastructures are in place. This evidence shows that there
has been an increasing
  gap between the theoretical representations of communication and those
empirically approximated,
  and therefore, there is a need to have strong automatic text-identification
systems where AI-based
  discourse is becoming more realistic in communicating with humans.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into
real-world applications, ensuring their outputs align with human values and
safety standards has become critical. The field has developed diverse alignment
approaches including traditional fine-tuning methods (RLHF, instruction
tuning), post-hoc correction systems, and inference-time interventions, each
with distinct advantages and limitations. However, the lack of unified
evaluation frameworks makes it difficult to systematically compare these
paradigms and guide deployment decisions. This paper introduces a
multi-dimensional evaluation of alignment techniques for LLMs, a comprehensive
evaluation framework that provides a systematic comparison across all major
alignment paradigms. Our framework assesses methods along four key dimensions:
alignment detection, alignment quality, computational efficiency, and
robustness. Through experiments across diverse base models and alignment
strategies, we demonstrate the utility of our framework in identifying
strengths and limitations of current state-of-the-art models, providing
valuable insights for future research directions.

Conclusion: VisCodex的模型合并策略和新数据集有效提升了多模态代码生成能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced the
integration of visual and textual understanding. However, their ability to
generate code from multimodal inputs remains limited. In this work, we
introduce VisCodex, a unified framework that seamlessly merges vision and
coding language models to empower MLLMs with strong multimodal code generation
abilities. Leveraging a task vector-based model merging technique, we integrate
a state-of-the-art coding LLM into a strong vision-language backbone, while
preserving both visual comprehension and advanced coding skills. To support
training and evaluation, we introduce the Multimodal Coding Dataset (MCD), a
large-scale and diverse collection of 598k samples, including high-quality HTML
code, chart image-code pairs, image-augmented StackOverflow QA, and algorithmic
problems. Furthermore, we propose InfiBench-V, a novel and challenging
benchmark specifically designed to assess models on visually-rich, real-world
programming questions that demand a nuanced understanding of both textual and
visual contexts. Extensive experiments show that VisCodex achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs and approaches proprietary

Method: 系统比较通用、医学和领域特定分词器在三种成像模态的放射学报告总结任务中的表现，并研究有无PubMed摘要预训练的影响。

Result: 医学和领域特定分词器在从头训练时表现优于通用分词器；预训练部分缓解了分词器间的性能差异，领域特定分词器表现最佳且计算效率更高。

Conclusion: 适应临床领域的词汇表能提升语言模型的性能和计算效率，使其更适用于研究和实际医疗场景。

Abstract: The vocabulary used by language models (LM) - defined by the tokenizer -
plays a key role in text generation quality. However, its impact remains
under-explored in radiology. In this work, we address this gap by
systematically comparing general, medical, and domain-specific tokenizers on
the task of radiology report summarisation across three imaging modalities. We
also investigate scenarios with and without LM pre-training on PubMed
abstracts. Our findings demonstrate that medical and domain-specific
vocabularies outperformed widely used natural language alternatives when models
are trained from scratch. Pre-training partially mitigates performance
differences between tokenizers, whilst the domain-specific tokenizers achieve
the most favourable results. Domain-specific tokenizers also reduce memory
requirements due to smaller vocabularies and shorter sequences. These results
demonstrate that adapting the vocabulary of LMs to the clinical domain provides
practical benefits, including improved performance and reduced computational
demands, making such models more accessible and effective for both research and
real-world healthcare settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感分析任务具有固有的模糊性，以往研究关注标注者特性，但忽略了上下文信息缺失可能是模糊性来源。

Method: 通过自动生成基于不同情感的事件链，结合短故事生成技术，创建上下文丰富的叙事。

Result: 自动和人工评估表明，上下文叙事能增强特定情感的解释，并提高标注一致性。

Conclusion: 上下文叙事有助于情感分析的可靠性和一致性。

Abstract: Emotion analysis is an inherently ambiguous task. Previous work studied
annotator properties to explain disagreement, but this overlooks the
possibility that ambiguity may stem from missing information about the context
of events. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that adds reasonable
contexts to event descriptions, which may better explain a particular
situation. Our goal is to understand whether these enriched contexts enable
human annotators to annotate emotions more reliably. We disambiguate a target
event description by automatically generating multiple event chains conditioned
on differing emotions. By combining techniques from short story generation in
various settings, we achieve coherent narratives that result in a specialized
dataset for the first comprehensive and systematic examination of
contextualized emotion analysis. Through automatic and human evaluation, we
find that contextual narratives enhance the interpretation of specific emotions
and support annotators in producing more consistent annotations.

Method: 评估12种GPT-5配置，使用260道眼科选择题，分析准确性、排名、理由质量和成本效益。

Result: GPT-5-high准确率最高（0.965），但GPT-5-mini-low在成本效益上表现最佳。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-5 integrate advanced reasoning
capabilities that may improve performance on complex medical question-answering
tasks. For this latest generation of reasoning models, the configurations that
maximize both accuracy and cost-efficiency have yet to be established. We
evaluated 12 configurations of OpenAI's GPT-5 series (three model tiers across
four reasoning effort settings) alongside o1-high, o3-high, and GPT-4o, using
260 closed-access multiple-choice questions from the American Academy of
Ophthalmology Basic Clinical Science Course (BCSC) dataset. The primary outcome
was multiple-choice accuracy; secondary outcomes included head-to-head ranking
via a Bradley-Terry model, rationale quality assessment using a
reference-anchored, pairwise LLM-as-a-judge framework, and analysis of
accuracy-cost trade-offs using token-based cost estimates. GPT-5-high achieved
the highest accuracy (0.965; 95% CI, 0.942-0.985), outperforming all GPT-5-nano
variants (P < .001), o1-high (P = .04), and GPT-4o (P < .001), but not o3-high
(0.958; 95% CI, 0.931-0.981). GPT-5-high ranked first in both accuracy (1.66x
stronger than o3-high) and rationale quality (1.11x stronger than o3-high).
Cost-accuracy analysis identified several GPT-5 configurations on the Pareto
frontier, with GPT-5-mini-low offering the most favorable low-cost,
high-performance balance. These results benchmark GPT-5 on a high-quality
ophthalmology dataset, demonstrate the influence of reasoning effort on
accuracy, and introduce an autograder framework for scalable evaluation of
LLM-generated answers against reference standards in ophthalmology.

### [44] [Which one Performs Better? Wav2Vec or Whisper? Applying both in Badini Kurdish Speech to Text (BKSTT)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09957)
*Renas Adnan,Hossein Hassani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究旨在为库尔德语中的Badini方言开发语音转文本（STT）系统，填补现有技术空白。通过使用Wav2Vec2-Large-XLSR-53和Whisper-small模型，实验表明前者在准确性和可读性上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Badini方言缺乏可用的STT系统，影响了其社区的科技使用和全球可见性。研究试图通过开发语言模型解决这一问题。

Method: 研究使用Badini儿童故事作为文本输入，经过预处理后，采用Wav2Vec2-Large-XLSR-53和Whisper-small模型进行实验。

Result: Wav2Vec2-Large-XLSR-53模型在可读性（90.38%）和准确性（82.67%）上显著优于Whisper-small模型（65.45%和53.17%）。

Conclusion: Wav2Vec2-Large-XLSR-53模型更适合用于Badini方言的STT系统开发。

Abstract: Speech-to-text (STT) systems have a wide range of applications. They are
available in many languages, albeit at different quality levels. Although
Kurdish is considered a less-resourced language from a processing perspective,
SST is available for some of the Kurdish dialects, for instance, Sorani
(Central Kurdish). However, that is not applied to other Kurdish dialects,
Badini and Hawrami, for example. This research is an attempt to address this
gap. Bandin, approximately, has two million speakers, and STT systems can help
their community use mobile and computer-based technologies while giving their
dialect more global visibility. We aim to create a language model based on
Badini's speech and evaluate its performance. To cover a conversational aspect,
have a proper confidence level of grammatical accuracy, and ready
transcriptions, we chose Badini kids' stories, eight books including 78
stories, as the textual input. Six narrators narrated the books, which resulted
in approximately 17 hours of recording. We cleaned, segmented, and tokenized
the input. The preprocessing produced nearly 15 hours of speech, including
19193 segments and 25221 words. We used Wav2Vec2-Large-XLSR-53 and
Whisper-small to develop the language models. The experiments indicate that the
transcriptions process based on the Wav2Vec2-Large-XLSR-53 model provides a
significantly more accurate and readable output than the Whisper-small model,
with 90.38% and 65.45% readability, and 82.67% and 53.17% accuracy,
respectively.

Conclusion: 该算法能够动态优化LLM序列选择，提升任务完成效率。

Abstract: With the increasing popularity of large language models (LLMs) for a variety
of tasks, there has been a growing interest in strategies that can predict
which out of a set of LLMs will yield a successful answer at low cost. This
problem promises to become more and more relevant as providers like Microsoft
allow users to easily create custom LLM "assistants" specialized to particular
types of queries. However, some tasks (i.e., queries) may be too specialized
and difficult for a single LLM to handle alone. These applications often
benefit from breaking down the task into smaller subtasks, each of which can
then be executed by a LLM expected to perform well on that specific subtask.
For example, in extracting a diagnosis from medical records, one can first
select an LLM to summarize the record, select another to validate the summary,
and then select another, possibly different, LLM to extract the diagnosis from
the summarized record. Unlike existing LLM selection or routing algorithms,
this setting requires that we select a sequence of LLMs, with the output of
each LLM feeding into the next and potentially influencing its success. Thus,
unlike single LLM selection, the quality of each subtask's output directly
affects the inputs, and hence the cost and success rate, of downstream LLMs,
creating complex performance dependencies that must be learned and accounted
for during selection. We propose a neural contextual bandit-based algorithm
that trains neural networks that model LLM success on each subtask in an online
manner, thus learning to guide the LLM selections for the different subtasks,
even in the absence of historical LLM performance data. Experiments on
telecommunications question answering and medical diagnosis prediction datasets
illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared to other LLM
selection algorithms.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态框架，用于检测针对女性的冒犯性内容，包括三个模块：MANM、GFRM和CFLM，在MAMI和MMHS150K数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上针对女性的冒犯性内容较多，现有方法难以有效检测，需针对性解决方案。

Method: 提出多模态框架，包括MANM（自适应门控多模态注意力）、GFRM（基于图的特征重构）和CFLM（内容特定特征学习），并结合词典评分和测试时增强。

Result: 在MAMI和MMHS150K数据集上，平均宏F1分别提高10.17%和8.88%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了针对女性的冒犯性内容检测性能，优于现有方法。

Abstract: A substantial portion of offensive content on social media is directed
towards women. Since the approaches for general offensive content detection
face a challenge in detecting misogynistic content, it requires solutions
tailored to address offensive content against women. To this end, we propose a
novel multimodal framework for the detection of misogynistic and sexist
content. The framework comprises three modules: the Multimodal Attention module
(MANM), the Graph-based Feature Reconstruction Module (GFRM), and the
Content-specific Features Learning Module (CFLM). The MANM employs adaptive
gating-based multimodal context-aware attention, enabling the model to focus on
relevant visual and textual information and generating contextually relevant
features. The GFRM module utilizes graphs to refine features within individual
modalities, while the CFLM focuses on learning text and image-specific features
such as toxicity features and caption features. Additionally, we curate a set
of misogynous lexicons to compute the misogyny-specific lexicon score from the
text. We apply test-time augmentation in feature space to better generalize the
predictions on diverse inputs. The performance of the proposed approach has
been evaluated on two multimodal datasets, MAMI and MMHS150K, with 11,000 and
13,494 samples, respectively. The proposed method demonstrates an average
improvement of 10.17% and 8.88% in macro-F1 over existing methods on the MAMI
and MMHS150K datasets, respectively.

TL;DR: IAD-R1是一个通用的后训练框架，显著提升了不同架构和参数规模的视觉语言模型（VLMs）在工业异常检测中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业异常检测中缺陷样本稀缺，传统方法受限，而现有VLMs的性能不足。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：PA-SFT阶段使用高质量Chain-of-Thought数据集增强异常感知；SC-GRPO阶段通过奖励函数实现从感知到解释的飞跃。

Result: 在7种VLMs上显著提升性能，平均准确率最高提升43.3%，0.5B参数模型在零样本设置下超越GPT-4.1等商业模型。

Conclusion: IAD-R1有效且优越，相关资源将开源。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection is a critical component of modern manufacturing,
yet the scarcity of defective samples restricts traditional detection methods
to scenario-specific applications. Although Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
demonstrate significant advantages in generalization capabilities, their
performance in industrial anomaly detection remains limited. To address this
challenge, we propose IAD-R1, a universal post-training framework applicable to
VLMs of different architectures and parameter scales, which substantially
enhances their anomaly detection capabilities. IAD-R1 employs a two-stage
training strategy: the Perception Activation Supervised Fine-Tuning (PA-SFT)
stage utilizes a meticulously constructed high-quality Chain-of-Thought dataset
(Expert-AD) for training, enhancing anomaly perception capabilities and
establishing reasoning-to-answer correlations; the Structured Control Group
Relative Policy Optimization (SC-GRPO) stage employs carefully designed reward
functions to achieve a capability leap from "Anomaly Perception" to "Anomaly
Interpretation". Experimental results demonstrate that IAD-R1 achieves
significant improvements across 7 VLMs, attaining up to 43.3% enhancement in
average accuracy on 6 industrial anomaly detection benchmark datasets. Notably,
the 0.5B parameter model trained with IAD-R1 surpasses commercial models
including GPT-4.1 and Claude-Sonnet-4 in zero-shot settings, demonstrating the
effectiveness and superiority of IAD-R1. The dataset, code, and all model
weights will be publicly available at https://github.com/Yanhui-Lee/IAD-R1.

TL;DR: CADAR是一种结合神经符号方法的新型AR认知攻击检测系统，通过融合视觉语言输入和符号推理，显著提高了检测准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AR认知攻击检测方法在语义推理和可解释性方面存在不足，CADAR旨在解决这一问题。

Method: CADAR结合预训练视觉语言模型和粒子滤波统计推理，生成符号感知图并进行时序分析。

Result: 在扩展的AR攻击数据集上，CADAR比基线方法准确率提升高达10.7%。

Conclusion: 神经符号方法在AR认知攻击检测中展现出高效性和可解释性潜力。

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) enriches perception by overlaying virtual elements on
the physical world. Due to its growing popularity, cognitive attacks that alter
AR content to manipulate users' semantic perception have received increasing
attention. Existing detection methods often focus on visual changes, which are
restricted to pixel- or image-level processing and lack semantic reasoning
capabilities, or they rely on pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), which
function as black-box approaches with limited interpretability. In this paper,
we present CADAR, a novel neurosymbolic approach for cognitive attack detection
in AR. It fuses multimodal vision-language inputs using neural VLMs to obtain a
symbolic perception-graph representation, incorporating prior knowledge,
salience weighting, and temporal correlations. The model then enables
particle-filter based statistical reasoning -- a sequential Monte Carlo method
-- to detect cognitive attacks. Thus, CADAR inherits the adaptability of
pre-trained VLM and the interpretability and reasoning rigor of particle
filtering. Experiments on an extended AR cognitive attack dataset show accuracy
improvements of up to 10.7% over strong baselines on challenging AR attack
scenarios, underscoring the promise of neurosymbolic methods for effective and
interpretable cognitive attack detection.

TL;DR: RL-MoE框架通过将视觉数据转换为隐私保护文本描述，解决了智能交通系统中隐私与数据效用之间的冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能交通系统中AI摄像头的普及引发了隐私与数据需求之间的冲突，现有隐私保护机制不足。

Method: 结合Mixture-of-Experts架构和强化学习代理，生成既语义准确又保护隐私的文本描述。

Result: RL-MoE显著降低重放攻击成功率至9.4%，同时生成比基线方法更丰富的文本内容。

Conclusion: RL-MoE为隐私敏感领域提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案，推动了更安全的智能城市和自动驾驶网络。

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-powered cameras in Intelligent Transportation Systems
(ITS) creates a severe conflict between the need for rich visual data and the
fundamental right to privacy. Existing privacy-preserving mechanisms, such as
blurring or encryption, are often insufficient, creating an undesirable
trade-off where either privacy is compromised against advanced reconstruction
attacks or data utility is critically degraded. To resolve this impasse, we
propose RL-MoE, a novel framework that transforms sensitive visual data into
privacy-preserving textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct image
transmission. RL-MoE uniquely combines a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
for nuanced, multi-aspect scene decomposition with a Reinforcement Learning
(RL) agent that optimizes the generated text for a dual objective of semantic
accuracy and privacy preservation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
RL-MoE provides superior privacy protection, reducing the success rate of
replay attacks to just 9.4\% on the CFP-FP dataset, while simultaneously
generating richer textual content than baseline methods. Our work provides a
practical and scalable solution for building trustworthy AI systems in
privacy-sensitive domains, paving the way for more secure smart city and
autonomous vehicle networks.

Abstract: Affective computing faces a major challenge: the lack of high-quality,
diverse depth facial datasets for recognizing subtle emotional expressions. We
propose a framework for synthetic depth face generation using an optimized GAN
with Knowledge Distillation (EMA teacher models) to stabilize training, improve
quality, and prevent mode collapse. We also apply Genetic Algorithms to evolve
GAN latent vectors based on image statistics, boosting diversity and visual
quality for target emotions. The approach outperforms GAN, VAE, GMM, and KDE in
both diversity and quality. For classification, we extract and concatenate LBP,
HOG, Sobel edge, and intensity histogram features, achieving 94% and 96%
accuracy with XGBoost. Evaluation using FID, IS, SSIM, and PSNR shows
consistent improvement over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Δ-AttnMask的数据高效框架，通过注意力引导的隐藏状态掩码量化样本质量，无需额外标签或训练，显著提升视觉指令微调的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉指令微调（VIF）需要多模态数据以支持视觉和文本的联合理解，但数据选择问题尚未充分研究，亟需高效且质量保证的方法。

Method: 提出Δ-AttnMask框架，通过计算原始状态与高注意力区域掩码状态之间的损失差异（Δ），评估样本质量。

Result: 实验表明，Δ-AttnMask仅需20%数据即可实现最优性能，训练速度提升5倍，整体准确率超过全数据集基线10.1%。

Conclusion: Δ-AttnMask具有模型无关和数据无关的设计，适用于多种模态和架构，为VIF提供了高效的数据选择方案。

Abstract: Visual Instruction Finetuning (VIF) is pivotal for post-training
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Unlike unimodal instruction finetuning in
plain-text large language models, which mainly requires instruction datasets to
enable model instruction-following ability, VIF also requires multimodal data
to enable joint visual and textual understanding; therefore, it typically
requires more data. Consequently, VIF imposes stricter data selection
challenges: the method must scale efficiently to handle larger data demands
while ensuring the quality of both visual and textual content, as well as their
alignment. Despite its critical impact on performance, data selection for VIF
remains an understudied area. In this paper, we propose $\Delta$-AttnMask. This
data-efficient framework quantifies sample quality through attention-guided
masking of the model's hidden states, jointly evaluating image-text pairs
without requiring domain labels, auxiliary models, or extra training. By
computing loss differences ($\Delta$) between the original states and states
masked using high-attention regions, $\Delta$-AttnMask intrinsically assesses
sample quality. Experiments across multiple VLMs and datasets show that
$\Delta$-AttnMask achieves state-of-the-art performance with just 20% of data,
accelerating training by 5x while surpassing full-dataset baselines by +10.1%
in overall accuracy. Its model-agnostic and data-agnostic design ensures broad
applicability across modalities and architectures.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) models are employed in many video-based
affective computing applications, such as human-computer interaction and
healthcare monitoring. However, deep FER models often struggle with subtle
expressions and high inter-subject variability, limiting their performance in
real-world applications. To improve their performance, source-free domain
adaptation (SFDA) methods have been proposed to personalize a pretrained source
model using only unlabeled target domain data, thereby avoiding data privacy,
storage, and transmission constraints. This paper addresses a challenging
scenario where source data is unavailable for adaptation, and only unlabeled
target data consisting solely of neutral expressions is available. SFDA methods
are not typically designed to adapt using target data from only a single class.
Further, using models to generate facial images with non-neutral expressions
can be unstable and computationally intensive. In this paper, personalized
feature translation (PFT) is proposed for SFDA. Unlike current image
translation methods for SFDA, our lightweight method operates in the latent
space. We first pre-train the translator on the source domain data to transform
the subject-specific style features from one source subject into another.
Expression information is preserved by optimizing a combination of expression
consistency and style-aware objectives. Then, the translator is adapted on
neutral target data, without using source data or image synthesis. By
translating in the latent space, PFT avoids the complexity and noise of face
expression generation, producing discriminative embeddings optimized for
classification. Using PFT eliminates the need for image synthesis, reduces
computational overhead (using a lightweight translator), and only adapts part
of the model, making the method efficient compared to image-based translation.

Conclusion: MME-Emotion可作为未来提升MLLMs情感情商的基础，通用模型和专用模型各有优势。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have catalyzed
transformative progress in affective computing, enabling models to exhibit
emergent emotional intelligence. Despite substantial methodological progress,
current emotional benchmarks remain limited, as it is still unknown: (a) the
generalization abilities of MLLMs across distinct scenarios, and (b) their
reasoning capabilities to identify the triggering factors behind emotional
states. To bridge these gaps, we present \textbf{MME-Emotion}, a systematic
benchmark that assesses both emotional understanding and reasoning capabilities
of MLLMs, enjoying \textit{scalable capacity}, \textit{diverse settings}, and
\textit{unified protocols}. As the largest emotional intelligence benchmark for
MLLMs, MME-Emotion contains over 6,000 curated video clips with task-specific
questioning-answering (QA) pairs, spanning broad scenarios to formulate eight
emotional tasks. It further incorporates a holistic evaluation suite with
hybrid metrics for emotion recognition and reasoning, analyzed through a
multi-agent system framework. Through a rigorous evaluation of 20 advanced
MLLMs, we uncover both their strengths and limitations, yielding several key
insights: \ding{182} Current MLLMs exhibit unsatisfactory emotional
intelligence, with the best-performing model achieving only $39.3\%$
recognition score and $56.0\%$ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) score on our benchmark.
\ding{183} Generalist models (\emph{e.g.}, Gemini-2.5-Pro) derive emotional
intelligence from generalized multimodal understanding capabilities, while
specialist models (\emph{e.g.}, R1-Omni) can achieve comparable performance
through domain-specific post-training adaptation. By introducing MME-Emotion,
we hope that it can serve as a foundation for advancing MLLMs' emotional
intelligence in the future.

Motivation: 当前对抗性提示的成功率评估标准可能高估了攻击效果，且安全机制未能有效阻止有害输出。

Method: 引入四轴评估框架（输入相关性、输入OOD强度、输出有害性、输出拒绝率）和BSD递归重写策略。

Result: BSD在13个MLLMs中显著提高了攻击成功率（67%）和输出有害性（21%）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前多模态安全系统的潜在弱点，并提出了一种更有效的对抗性提示方法。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are widely used in vision-language
reasoning tasks. However, their vulnerability to adversarial prompts remains a
serious concern, as safety mechanisms often fail to prevent the generation of
harmful outputs. Although recent jailbreak strategies report high success
rates, many responses classified as "successful" are actually benign, vague, or
unrelated to the intended malicious goal. This mismatch suggests that current
evaluation standards may overestimate the effectiveness of such attacks. To
address this issue, we introduce a four-axis evaluation framework that
considers input on-topicness, input out-of-distribution (OOD) intensity, output
harmfulness, and output refusal rate. This framework identifies truly effective
jailbreaks. In a substantial empirical study, we reveal a structural trade-off:
highly on-topic prompts are frequently blocked by safety filters, whereas those
that are too OOD often evade detection but fail to produce harmful content.
However, prompts that balance relevance and novelty are more likely to evade
filters and trigger dangerous output. Building on this insight, we develop a
recursive rewriting strategy called Balanced Structural Decomposition (BSD).
The approach restructures malicious prompts into semantically aligned
sub-tasks, while introducing subtle OOD signals and visual cues that make the
inputs harder to detect. BSD was tested across 13 commercial and open-source
MLLMs, where it consistently led to higher attack success rates, more harmful
outputs, and fewer refusals. Compared to previous methods, it improves success
rates by $67\%$ and harmfulness by $21\%$, revealing a previously
underappreciated weakness in current multimodal safety systems.

\textbf{R}ecognition (HMER) has been impeded by the scarcity of data, primarily

largest formula dataset to date, termed \texttt{Tex80M}, comprising over 80
million high-quality training instances. Then we propose \texttt{TexTeller},
the first HMER model trained at scale, by mix-training \texttt{Tex80M} with a
relatively small HME dataset. The expansive training dataset and our refined
pipeline have equipped \texttt{TexTeller} with state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance across nearly all benchmarks. To advance the field, we will openly

Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅方法在复杂场景中存在过度重建和过度密集化问题，导致内存开销增加和渲染质量下降。

Method: GDAGS引入梯度一致性比率（GCR）和非线性动态加权机制，根据梯度方向自适应控制高斯分布，优化重建和密集化过程。

Result: GDAGS在多种真实场景基准测试中表现出色，渲染质量提升，内存消耗减少50%。

Conclusion: GDAGS通过梯度方向感知的密度控制，有效解决了3D高斯泼溅的关键问题，为实时逼真渲染提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has significantly advanced
novel view synthesis through explicit scene representation, enabling real-time
photorealistic rendering. However, existing approaches manifest two critical
limitations in complex scenarios: (1) Over-reconstruction occurs when
persistent large Gaussians cannot meet adaptive splitting thresholds during
density control. This is exacerbated by conflicting gradient directions that
prevent effective splitting of these Gaussians; (2) Over-densification of
Gaussians occurs in regions with aligned gradient aggregation, leading to
redundant component proliferation. This redundancy significantly increases
memory overhead due to unnecessary data retention. We present
Gradient-Direction-Aware Gaussian Splatting (GDAGS), a gradient-direction-aware
adaptive density control framework to address these challenges. Our key
innovations: the gradient coherence ratio (GCR), computed through normalized
gradient vector norms, which explicitly discriminates Gaussians with concordant
versus conflicting gradient directions; and a nonlinear dynamic weighting
mechanism leverages the GCR to enable gradient-direction-aware density control.
Specifically, GDAGS prioritizes conflicting-gradient Gaussians during splitting
operations to enhance geometric details while suppressing redundant
concordant-direction Gaussians. Conversely, in cloning processes, GDAGS
promotes concordant-direction Gaussian densification for structural completion
while preventing conflicting-direction Gaussian overpopulation. Comprehensive
evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that GDAGS
achieves superior rendering quality while effectively mitigating
over-reconstruction, suppressing over-densification, and constructing compact
scene representations with 50\% reduced memory consumption through optimized
Gaussians utilization.

Method: 提出了FineState-Bench，一个多平台框架，包含2257个任务基准，并通过四阶段指标进行全面评估。开发了视觉诊断助手（VDA）进行定量解耦分析。

Result: 实验显示，最先进模型的细粒度交互准确率仅为32.8%。理想视觉定位可提升Gemini-2.5-Flash的成功率14.9%。

Conclusion: 当前GUI代理的主要瓶颈是基础视觉定位能力，FineState-Bench为未来研究提供了开源工具。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence technology,
Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have demonstrated tremendous potential
for autonomously managing daily tasks through natural language instructions.
However, current evaluation frameworks for GUI agents suffer from fundamental
flaws: existing benchmarks overly focus on coarse-grained task completion while
neglecting fine-grained control capabilities crucial for real-world
applications. To address this, we introduce FineState-Bench, the first
evaluation and diagnostic standard for fine-grained GUI proxy operations,
designed to quantify fine-grained control. This multi-platform (desktop, Web,
mobile) framework includes 2257 task benchmarks in four components and uses a
four-phase indicator for comprehensive perception-to-control assessment. To
analyze perception and positioning for refined operations, we developed the
plug-and-play Visual Diagnostic Assistant (VDA), enabling the first
quantitative decoupling analysis of these capabilities. Experimental results on
our benchmark show that the most advanced models achieve only 32.8%
fine-grained interaction accuracy. Using our VDA in controlled experiments,
quantifying the impact of visual capabilities, we showed that ideal visual
localization boosts Gemini-2.5-Flash's success rate by 14.9\%. Our diagnostic
framework confirms for the first time that the primary bottleneck for current

Abstract: As visual assistant systems powered by visual language models (VLMs) become

of usability. In this work, we propose FiGPriv, a fine-grained privacy
protection framework that selectively masks only high-risk private information
while preserving low-risk information. Our approach integrates fine-grained
segmentation with a data-driven risk scoring mechanism. We evaluate our
framework using the BIV-Priv-Seg dataset and show that FiG-Priv preserves +26%
of image content, enhancing the ability of VLMs to provide useful responses by
11% and identify the image content by 45%, while ensuring privacy protection.

### [60] [Harnessing Input-Adaptive Inference for Efficient VLN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09262)
*Dongwoo Kang,Akhil Perincherry,Zachary Coalson,Aiden Gabriel,Stefan Lee,Sanghyun Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型输入自适应导航方法，通过三种算法提升视觉与语言导航模型的效率，显著减少计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有输入自适应机制在减少计算量时会导致性能显著下降，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 引入三种自适应算法：选择性处理全景视图、基于重要性的自适应阈值和缓存机制。

Result: 在七个VLN基准测试中，计算量减少超过2倍，且性能未显著下降。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了模型效率，适用于计算资源有限的实际场景。

Abstract: An emerging paradigm in vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is the use of
history-aware multi-modal transformer models. Given a language instruction,
these models process observation and navigation history to predict the most
appropriate action for an agent. While they have significantly improved
performance, the scale of these models can be a bottleneck in practical
settings with limited computational resources. In this work, we propose a novel
input-adaptive navigation method to enhance VLN model efficiency. We first show
that existing input-adaptive mechanisms fail to reduce computations without
substantial performance degradation. To address this, we introduce three
adaptive algorithms, each deployed at a different level: (1) To improve spatial
efficiency, we selectively process panoramic views at each observation of an
agent. (2) To improve intra-model efficiency, we propose importance-based
adaptive thresholding for the early-exit methods. (3) To improve temporal
efficiency, we implement a caching mechanism that prevents reprocessing of
views previously seen by the agent. In evaluations on seven VLN benchmarks, we
demonstrate over a 2$\times$ reduction in computation across three
off-the-shelf agents in both standard and continuous environments. Our code is
publicly available at

TL;DR: SegDAC是一种基于分割的视觉强化学习方法，利用SAM和YOLO-World进行对象分解和语义标注，通过动态Transformer架构提升视觉泛化能力和样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉强化学习需要从高维输入和噪声奖励中学习感知和动作，现有大模型在RL中的整合效果不明确，SegDAC旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SegDAC结合SAM进行对象分解，YOLO-World通过文本提示语义标注，采用动态Transformer架构，在线RL学习关注关键片段。

Result: 在Maniskill3基准测试中，SegDAC在视觉泛化能力上显著优于现有方法，样本效率也达到或超越先前水平。

Conclusion: SegDAC通过对象分解和动态Transformer架构，有效提升了视觉强化学习的泛化能力和样本效率。

Abstract: Visual reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging due to the need to learn
both perception and actions from high-dimensional inputs and noisy rewards.
Although large perception models exist, integrating them effectively into RL
for visual generalization and improved sample efficiency remains unclear. We
propose SegDAC, a Segmentation-Driven Actor-Critic method. SegDAC uses Segment
Anything (SAM) for object-centric decomposition and YOLO-World to ground
segments semantically via text prompts. It includes a novel transformer-based
architecture that supports a dynamic number of segments at each time step and
effectively learns which segments to focus on using online RL, without using
human labels. By evaluating SegDAC over a challenging visual generalization
benchmark using Maniskill3, which covers diverse manipulation tasks under
strong visual perturbations, we demonstrate that SegDAC achieves significantly
better visual generalization, doubling prior performance on the hardest setting
and matching or surpassing prior methods in sample efficiency across all
evaluated tasks.

TL;DR: Lung-DDPM+是一种改进的生成模型，用于高效生成高质量的肺部CT图像，解决了现有模型效率低和解剖不精确的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型在肺部癌症诊断中效率低且解剖不精确，限制了临床应用。

Method: 提出Lung-DDPM+，基于结节语义布局的DDPM模型，并采用肺部DPM-solver加速。

Result: 在LIDC-IDRI数据集上，FLOPs减少8倍，GPU内存消耗降低6.8倍，采样速度提升14倍，同时保持样本质量。

Conclusion: Lung-DDPM+能高效生成高质量肺部CT图像，具有广泛临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been playing an important role in
various domains. Leveraging its high capability to generate high-fidelity and
diverse synthetic data, generative AI is widely applied in diagnostic tasks,
such as lung cancer diagnosis using computed tomography (CT). However, existing
generative models for lung cancer diagnosis suffer from low efficiency and
anatomical imprecision, which limit their clinical applicability. To address
these drawbacks, we propose Lung-DDPM+, an improved version of our previous
model, Lung-DDPM. This novel approach is a denoising diffusion probabilistic
model (DDPM) guided by nodule semantic layouts and accelerated by a pulmonary
DPM-solver, enabling the method to focus on lesion areas while achieving a
better trade-off between sampling efficiency and quality. Evaluation results on
the public LIDC-IDRI dataset suggest that the proposed method achieves
8$\times$ fewer FLOPs (floating point operations per second), 6.8$\times$ lower
GPU memory consumption, and 14$\times$ faster sampling compared to Lung-DDPM.
Moreover, it maintains comparable sample quality to both Lung-DDPM and other
state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models in two downstream segmentation tasks.
We also conducted a Visual Turing Test by an experienced radiologist, showing
the advanced quality and fidelity of synthetic samples generated by the
proposed method. These experimental results demonstrate that Lung-DDPM+ can
effectively generate high-quality thoracic CT images with lung nodules,
highlighting its potential for broader applications, such as general tumor
synthesis and lesion generation in medical imaging. The code and pretrained
models are available at https://github.com/Manem-Lab/Lung-DDPM-PLUS.

Conclusion: 基于注意力融合的多样化时空网络集成方法，为复杂多模态手势识别提供了鲁棒且高精度的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate recognition of sign language in healthcare communication poses a
significant challenge, requiring frameworks that can accurately interpret
complex multimodal gestures. To deal with this, we propose FusionEnsemble-Net,
a novel attention-based ensemble of spatiotemporal networks that dynamically
fuses visual and motion data to enhance recognition accuracy. The proposed
approach processes RGB video and range Doppler map radar modalities
synchronously through four different spatiotemporal networks. For each network,
features from both modalities are continuously fused using an attention-based
fusion module before being fed into an ensemble of classifiers. Finally, the
outputs of these four different fused channels are combined in an ensemble
classification head, thereby enhancing the model's robustness. Experiments
demonstrate that FusionEnsemble-Net outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
with a test accuracy of 99.44% on the large-scale MultiMeDaLIS dataset for
Italian Sign Language. Our findings indicate that an ensemble of diverse
spatiotemporal networks, unified by attention-based fusion, yields a robust and
accurate framework for complex, multimodal isolated gesture recognition tasks.

Motivation: 解决CSLR中签名者间差异大和对新句子结构泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 使用Signer-Invariant Conformer结合卷积和多头自注意力学习签名无关表示；设计Multi-Scale Fusion Transformer的双路径时间编码器捕捉细粒度姿态动态。

Conclusion: 针对CSLR特定挑战设计的任务专用网络显著提升性能，为后续研究设定了新基准。

Abstract: Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) faces multiple challenges,
including significant inter-signer variability and poor generalization to novel
sentence structures. Traditional solutions frequently fail to handle these
issues efficiently. For overcoming these constraints, we propose a
dual-architecture framework. For the Signer-Independent (SI) challenge, we
propose a Signer-Invariant Conformer that combines convolutions with multi-head
self-attention to learn robust, signer-agnostic representations from pose-based
skeletal keypoints. For the Unseen-Sentences (US) task, we designed a
Multi-Scale Fusion Transformer with a novel dual-path temporal encoder that
captures both fine-grained posture dynamics, enabling the model's ability to
comprehend novel grammatical compositions. Experiments on the challenging
Isharah-1000 dataset establish a new standard for both CSLR benchmarks. The
proposed conformer architecture achieves a Word Error Rate (WER) of 13.07% on
the SI challenge, a reduction of 13.53% from the state-of-the-art. On the US
task, the transformer model scores a WER of 47.78%, surpassing previous work.
In the SignEval 2025 CSLR challenge, our team placed 2nd in the US task and 4th
in the SI task, demonstrating the performance of these models. The findings
validate our key hypothesis: that developing task-specific networks designed
for the particular challenges of CSLR leads to considerable performance
improvements and establishes a new baseline for further research. The source

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割中注释者的变异性（如边界模糊、注释者偏好等）影响标注一致性，尤其是恶性病变。研究旨在量化这种变异性并利用其提升分割性能。

Method: 构建了IMA++数据集，研究注释者、恶性程度等因素对变异性影响，并利用IAA预测和多任务学习提升模型。

Result: 发现IAA与恶性程度显著相关（p<0.001），IAA预测误差为0.108，多任务学习使平衡准确率提升4.2%。

Conclusion: IAA可作为临床特征提升分割模型性能，研究提供了公开数据集和代码。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation exhibits intra- and inter-annotator variability
due to ambiguous object boundaries, annotator preferences, expertise, and
tools, among other factors. Lesions with ambiguous boundaries, e.g., spiculated
or infiltrative nodules, or irregular borders per the ABCD rule, are
particularly prone to disagreement and are often associated with malignancy. In
this work, we curate IMA++, the largest multi-annotator skin lesion
segmentation dataset, on which we conduct an in-depth study of variability due
to annotator, malignancy, tool, and skill factors. We find a statistically
significant (p<0.001) association between inter-annotator agreement (IAA),
measured using Dice, and the malignancy of skin lesions. We further show that
IAA can be accurately predicted directly from dermoscopic images, achieving a
mean absolute error of 0.108. Finally, we leverage this association by
utilizing IAA as a "soft" clinical feature within a multi-task learning
objective, yielding a 4.2% improvement in balanced accuracy averaged across
multiple model architectures and across IMA++ and four public dermoscopic
datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/sfu-mial/skin-IAV.

Method: 采用自监督端到端框架，结合DiT生成模型，通过空间和颜色增强以及合成3D渲染实现运动-身份解耦。

Result: 实验表明，X-UniMotion在运动保真度和身份保持方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: X-UniMotion提供了一种高效、高保真的跨身份运动转移解决方案。

Abstract: We present X-UniMotion, a unified and expressive implicit latent
representation for whole-body human motion, encompassing facial expressions,
body poses, and hand gestures. Unlike prior motion transfer methods that rely
on explicit skeletal poses and heuristic cross-identity adjustments, our
approach encodes multi-granular motion directly from a single image into a
compact set of four disentangled latent tokens -- one for facial expression,
one for body pose, and one for each hand. These motion latents are both highly
expressive and identity-agnostic, enabling high-fidelity, detailed
cross-identity motion transfer across subjects with diverse identities, poses,
and spatial configurations. To achieve this, we introduce a self-supervised,
end-to-end framework that jointly learns the motion encoder and latent
representation alongside a DiT-based video generative model, trained on
large-scale, diverse human motion datasets. Motion-identity disentanglement is
enforced via 2D spatial and color augmentations, as well as synthetic 3D
renderings of cross-identity subject pairs under shared poses. Furthermore, we
guide motion token learning with auxiliary decoders that promote fine-grained,
semantically aligned, and depth-aware motion embeddings. Extensive experiments
show that X-UniMotion outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing highly
expressive animations with superior motion fidelity and identity preservation.

Result: 在多个SAR数据集上表现优异，SARDet-100K数据集上比DenoDet V1提升0.8%，同时模型复杂度减半。

Conclusion: DenoDet V2为SAR目标检测提供了一种高效且性能优越的新方法。

Abstract: One of the primary challenges in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object
detection lies in the pervasive influence of coherent noise. As a common
practice, most existing methods, whether handcrafted approaches or deep
learning-based methods, employ the analysis or enhancement of object
spatial-domain characteristics to achieve implicit denoising. In this paper, we
propose DenoDet V2, which explores a completely novel and different perspective
to deconstruct and modulate the features in the transform domain via a
carefully designed attention architecture. Compared to DenoDet V1, DenoDet V2
is a major advancement that exploits the complementary nature of amplitude and
phase information through a band-wise mutual modulation mechanism, which
enables a reciprocal enhancement between phase and amplitude spectra. Extensive
experiments on various SAR datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art
performance of DenoDet V2. Notably, DenoDet V2 achieves a significant 0.8\%
improvement on SARDet-100K dataset compared to DenoDet V1, while reducing the
model complexity by half. The code is available at

Abstract: This paper presents a low cost, on premise system for autonomous backyard

short clips via FTP to a local server, where frames are sampled and birds are
localized with Detectron2; cropped regions are then classified by an
EfficientNet-B3 model fine tuned on a 40-species Belgian subset derived from a
larger Kaggle corpus. All processing runs on commodity hardware without a
discrete GPU, preserving privacy and avoiding cloud fees. The physical feeder
uses small entry ports (30 mm) to exclude pigeons and reduce nuisance triggers.
Detector-guided cropping improves classification accuracy over raw-frame
classification. The classifier attains high validation performance on the
curated subset (about 99.5 percent) and delivers practical field accuracy
(top-1 about 88 percent) on held-out species, demonstrating feasibility for
citizen-science-grade biodiversity logging at home.

Abstract: Large-scale high-quality 3D motion datasets with multi-person interactions
are crucial for data-driven models in autonomous driving to achieve
fine-grained pedestrian interaction understanding in dynamic urban
environments. However, existing datasets mostly rely on estimating 3D poses
from monocular RGB video frames, which suffer from occlusion and lack of
temporal continuity, thus resulting in unrealistic and low-quality human
motion. In this paper, we introduce Waymo-3DSkelMo, the first large-scale
dataset providing high-quality, temporally coherent 3D skeletal motions with
explicit interaction semantics, derived from the Waymo Perception dataset. Our
key insight is to utilize 3D human body shape and motion priors to enhance the
quality of the 3D pose sequences extracted from the raw LiDRA point clouds. The
dataset covers over 14,000 seconds across more than 800 real driving scenarios,
including rich interactions among an average of 27 agents per scene (with up to
250 agents in the largest scene). Furthermore, we establish 3D pose forecasting
benchmarks under varying pedestrian densities, and the results demonstrate its
value as a foundational resource for future research on fine-grained human
behavior understanding in complex urban environments. The dataset and code will

Conclusion: 贡献首个大规模高质量路缘坡道检测数据集、基准和模型。

Abstract: Curb ramps are critical for urban accessibility, but robustly detecting them
in images remains an open problem due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality
datasets. While prior work has attempted to improve data availability with
crowdsourced or manually labeled data, these efforts often fall short in either
quality or scale. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate a two-stage pipeline
called RampNet to scale curb ramp detection datasets and improve model
performance. In Stage 1, we generate a dataset of more than 210,000 annotated
Google Street View (GSV) panoramas by auto-translating government-provided curb
ramp location data to pixel coordinates in panoramic images. In Stage 2, we
train a curb ramp detection model (modified ConvNeXt V2) from the generated
dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance. To evaluate both stages of our
pipeline, we compare to manually labeled panoramas. Our generated dataset
achieves 94.0% precision and 92.5% recall, and our detection model reaches
0.9236 AP -- far exceeding prior work. Our work contributes the first
large-scale, high-quality curb ramp detection dataset, benchmark, and model.

Method: 利用LLM推断空间先验，编码为二维高斯场并注入目标地图，通过生成流模型实现更通用的补全。

Result: 在MP3D和Gibson上达到SOTA性能，并在HM3D上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: GOAL通过结合生成流和LLM先验，显著提升了ObjectNav任务的泛化性和性能。

Abstract: The Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) task challenges agents to locate a
specified object in an unseen environment by imagining unobserved regions of
the scene. Prior approaches rely on deterministic and discriminative models to
complete semantic maps, overlooking the inherent uncertainty in indoor layouts
and limiting their ability to generalize to unseen environments. In this work,
we propose GOAL, a generative flow-based framework that models the semantic
distribution of indoor environments by bridging observed regions with
LLM-enriched full-scene semantic maps. During training, spatial priors inferred
from large language models (LLMs) are encoded as two-dimensional Gaussian
fields and injected into target maps, distilling rich contextual knowledge into
the flow model and enabling more generalizable completions. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GOAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on MP3D
and Gibson, and shows strong generalization in transfer settings to HM3D. Codes
and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/Badi-Li/GOAL.

Conclusion: PaIR-Net和PaIR数据集为联合建模动作语义与空间上下文提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: People control their bodies to establish contact with the environment. To
comprehensively understand actions across diverse visual contexts, it is
essential to simultaneously consider \textbf{what} action is occurring and
\textbf{where} it is happening. Current methodologies, however, often
inadequately capture this duality, typically failing to jointly model both
action semantics and their spatial contextualization within scenes. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a novel vision task that simultaneously predicts
high-level action semantics and fine-grained body-part contact regions. Our
proposed framework, PaIR-Net, comprises three key components: the Contact Prior
Aware Module (CPAM) for identifying contact-relevant body parts, the
Prior-Guided Concat Segmenter (PGCS) for pixel-wise contact segmentation, and
the Interaction Inference Module (IIM) responsible for integrating global
interaction relationships. To facilitate this task, we present PaIR (Part-aware
Interaction Representation), a comprehensive dataset containing 13,979 images
that encompass 654 actions, 80 object categories, and 17 body parts.
Experimental evaluation demonstrates that PaIR-Net significantly outperforms
baseline approaches, while ablation studies confirm the efficacy of each
architectural component. The code and dataset will be released upon
publication.

### [76] [MPT: Motion Prompt Tuning for Micro-Expression Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09446)
*Jiateng Liu,Hengcan Shi,Feng Chen,Zhiwen Shao,Yaonan Wang,Jianfei Cai,Wenming Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Motion Prompt Tuning (MPT)的新方法，通过运动提示生成和组适配器设计，将大型预训练模型（LMs）适应于微表情识别（MER）任务，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情识别在医疗诊断、谎言检测等领域有广泛应用，但由于标注困难，数据集样本稀缺，现有模型难以捕捉微表情的短暂和细微特征。

Method: MPT方法包括运动提示生成（运动放大和高斯标记化）和组适配器设计，以增强LMs在MER任务中的表现。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的MER数据集上的实验表明，MPT方法优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MPT为微表情识别提供了一种有效的解决方案，通过适应LMs捕捉细微运动特征，显著提升了识别性能。

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is crucial in the affective computing
field due to its wide application in medical diagnosis, lie detection, and
criminal investigation. Despite its significance, obtaining micro-expression
(ME) annotations is challenging due to the expertise required from
psychological professionals. Consequently, ME datasets often suffer from a
scarcity of training samples, severely constraining the learning of MER models.
While current large pre-training models (LMs) offer general and discriminative
representations, their direct application to MER is hindered by an inability to
capture transitory and subtle facial movements-essential elements for effective
MER. This paper introduces Motion Prompt Tuning (MPT) as a novel approach to
adapting LMs for MER, representing a pioneering method for subtle motion prompt
tuning. Particularly, we introduce motion prompt generation, including motion
magnification and Gaussian tokenization, to extract subtle motions as prompts
for LMs. Additionally, a group adapter is carefully designed and inserted into
the LM to enhance it in the target MER domain, facilitating a more nuanced
distinction of ME representation. Furthermore, extensive experiments conducted
on three widely used MER datasets demonstrate that our proposed MPT
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art approaches and verifies its
effectiveness.

*Jiaqi Yan,Shuning Xu,Xiangyu Chen,Dell Zhang,Jie Tang,Gangshan Wu,Jie Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的检索增强超分辨率（RASR）方法，通过自动从参考数据库中检索高分辨率图像来提升低质量输入图像的分辨率，解决了现有RefSR方法依赖手动配对的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RefSR方法依赖手动配对的参考图像，限制了实际应用。RASR旨在通过自动检索相关参考图像，提升方法的实用性和灵活性。

Method: 提出RASRNet，结合语义参考检索器和基于扩散的RefSR生成器，通过语义相似性检索参考图像，并利用语义条件增强生成效果。

Result: 在RASR-Flickr30数据集上，RASRNet比SISR基线方法提升了0.38 dB PSNR和-0.0131 LPIPS，生成更真实的纹理。

Conclusion: 检索增强是连接学术研究与实际应用的有效方向，RASR展示了在开放世界检索场景中的潜力。

Abstract: Reference-based Super Resolution (RefSR) improves upon Single Image Super
Resolution (SISR) by leveraging high-quality reference images to enhance
texture fidelity and visual realism. However, a critical limitation of existing
RefSR approaches is their reliance on manually curated target-reference image
pairs, which severely constrains their practicality in real-world scenarios. To
overcome this, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Super Resolution (RASR), a new
and practical RefSR paradigm that automatically retrieves semantically relevant
high-resolution images from a reference database given only a low-quality
input. This enables scalable and flexible RefSR in realistic use cases, such as
enhancing mobile photos taken in environments like zoos or museums, where
category-specific reference data (e.g., animals, artworks) can be readily
collected or pre-curated. To facilitate research in this direction, we
construct RASR-Flickr30, the first benchmark dataset designed for RASR. Unlike
prior datasets with fixed target-reference pairs, RASR-Flickr30 provides
per-category reference databases to support open-world retrieval. We further
propose RASRNet, a strong baseline that combines a semantic reference retriever
with a diffusion-based RefSR generator. It retrieves relevant references based
on semantic similarity and employs a diffusion-based generator enhanced with
semantic conditioning. Experiments on RASR-Flickr30 demonstrate that RASRNet
consistently improves over SISR baselines, achieving +0.38 dB PSNR and -0.0131
LPIPS, while generating more realistic textures. These findings highlight
retrieval augmentation as a promising direction to bridge the gap between
academic RefSR research and real-world applicability.

Motivation: 基础模型在大规模无标签数据上预训练后，可直接用于多种下游任务，但在高光谱遥感中应用仍面临光谱差异和数据稀缺的挑战。

Method: HyperKD利用Masked Autoencoder，通过特征级策略（如光谱范围通道对齐、空间特征引导掩码和增强损失函数）从Prithvi基础模型向EnMAP高光谱图像学生模型转移知识。

Result: 实验表明，HyperKD显著提升了MAE中的表示学习，改善了重建保真度，并在土地覆盖分类、作物类型识别和土壤有机碳预测等下游任务中表现更稳健。

Conclusion: HyperKD通过知识蒸馏框架有效弥合了光谱域差距，为高光谱遥感分析提供了潜力。

Abstract: The proliferation of foundation models, pretrained on large-scale unlabeled
datasets, has emerged as an effective approach in creating adaptable and
reusable architectures that can be leveraged for various downstream tasks using
satellite observations. However, their direct application to hyperspectral
remote sensing remains challenging due to inherent spectral disparities and the
scarcity of available observations. In this work, we present HyperKD, a novel
knowledge distillation framework that enables transferring learned
representations from a teacher model into a student model for effective
development of a foundation model on hyperspectral images. Unlike typical
knowledge distillation frameworks, which use a complex teacher to guide a
simpler student, HyperKD enables an inverse form of knowledge transfer across
different types of spectral data, guided by a simpler teacher model. Building
upon a Masked Autoencoder, HyperKD distills knowledge from the Prithvi
foundational model into a student tailored for EnMAP hyperspectral imagery.
HyperKD addresses the inverse domain adaptation problem with spectral gaps by
introducing a feature-based strategy that includes spectral range-based channel
alignment, spatial feature-guided masking, and an enhanced loss function
tailored for hyperspectral images. HyperKD bridges the substantial spectral
domain gap, enabling the effective use of pretrained foundation models for
geospatial applications. Extensive experiments show that HyperKD significantly
improves representation learning in MAEs, leading to enhanced reconstruction
fidelity and more robust performance on downstream tasks such as land cover
classification, crop type identification, and soil organic carbon prediction,
underpinning the potential of knowledge distillation frameworks in remote
sensing analytics with hyperspectral imagery.

Motivation: 现有方法主要适用于人类角色，对拟人化角色泛化能力不足，且只能生成静态背景视频，限制了视频的真实感。

Method: 提出 Pose Indicator 结合隐式和显式方法捕捉运动模式，并采用多任务训练策略联合训练动画和 TI2V 任务。

Result: 实验证明 Animate-X++ 在通用性和适用性上的优越性，并通过 A2Bench 基准验证其性能。

Conclusion: Animate-X++ 在角色动画和背景动态生成方面表现出色，为行业应用提供了更真实的视频生成解决方案。

Abstract: Character image animation, which generates high-quality videos from a
reference image and target pose sequence, has seen significant progress in
recent years. However, most existing methods only apply to human figures, which
usually do not generalize well on anthropomorphic characters commonly used in
industries like gaming and entertainment. Furthermore, previous methods could
only generate videos with static backgrounds, which limits the realism of the
videos. For the first challenge, our in-depth analysis suggests to attribute
this limitation to their insufficient modeling of motion, which is unable to
comprehend the movement pattern of the driving video, thus imposing a pose
sequence rigidly onto the target character. To this end, this paper proposes
Animate-X++, a universal animation framework based on DiT for various character
types, including anthropomorphic characters. To enhance motion representation,
we introduce the Pose Indicator, which captures comprehensive motion pattern
from the driving video through both implicit and explicit manner. The former
leverages CLIP visual features of a driving video to extract its gist of
motion, like the overall movement pattern and temporal relations among motions,
while the latter strengthens the generalization of DiT by simulating possible
inputs in advance that may arise during inference. For the second challenge, we
introduce a multi-task training strategy that jointly trains the animation and
TI2V tasks. Combined with the proposed partial parameter training, this
approach achieves not only character animation but also text-driven background
dynamics, making the videos more realistic. Moreover, we introduce a new
Animated Anthropomorphic Benchmark (A2Bench) to evaluate the performance of
Animate-X++ on universal and widely applicable animation images. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of Animate-X++.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在视觉定位任务中表现优异，但其安全性问题，尤其是后门攻击，尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出IAG方法，利用文本条件U-Net将攻击目标的语义信息嵌入原始图像，并通过重建损失确保攻击隐蔽性。

Result: 在InternVL-2.5-8B上ASR@0.5超过65%，且在Ferret-7B和LlaVA-1.5-7B上表现出色，对干净样本的准确性影响极小。

Conclusion: IAG方法具有鲁棒性和可迁移性，为视觉语言模型的安全性研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant advancements in tasks
such as visual grounding, where they localize specific objects in images based
on natural language queries and images. However, security issues in visual
grounding tasks for VLMs remain underexplored, especially in the context of
backdoor attacks. In this paper, we introduce a novel input-aware backdoor
attack method, IAG, designed to manipulate the grounding behavior of VLMs. This
attack forces the model to ground a specific target object in the input image,
regardless of the user's query. We propose an adaptive trigger generator that
embeds the semantic information of the attack target's description into the
original image using a text-conditional U-Net, thereby overcoming the
open-vocabulary attack challenge. To ensure the attack's stealthiness, we
utilize a reconstruction loss to minimize visual discrepancies between poisoned
and clean images. Additionally, we introduce a unified method for generating
attack data. IAG is evaluated theoretically and empirically, demonstrating its
feasibility and effectiveness. Notably, our ASR@0.5 on InternVL-2.5-8B reaches
over 65\% on various testing sets. IAG also shows promising potential on
manipulating Ferret-7B and LlaVA-1.5-7B with very little accuracy decrease on
clean samples. Extensive specific experiments, such as ablation study and
potential defense, also indicate the robustness and transferability of our
attack.

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进的定位性能，为可扩展和模态无关的VML设定了新基准。

Conclusion: RelayFormer通过模块化设计和高效处理能力，为视觉篡改定位任务提供了强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual manipulation localization (VML) -- across both images and videos -- is
a crucial task in digital forensics that involves identifying tampered regions
in visual content. However, existing methods often lack cross-modal
generalization and struggle to handle high-resolution or long-duration inputs
efficiently.
  We propose RelayFormer, a unified and modular architecture for visual
manipulation localization across images and videos. By leveraging flexible
local units and a Global-Local Relay Attention (GLoRA) mechanism, it enables
scalable, resolution-agnostic processing with strong generalization. Our
framework integrates seamlessly with existing Transformer-based backbones, such
as ViT and SegFormer, via lightweight adaptation modules that require only
minimal architectural changes, ensuring compatibility without disrupting
pretrained representations.
  Furthermore, we design a lightweight, query-based mask decoder that supports
one-shot inference across video sequences with linear complexity. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art localization performance, setting a new baseline for scalable
and modality-agnostic VML. Code is available at:

Abstract: Different forms of customized 2D avatars are widely used in gaming
applications, virtual communication, education, and content creation. However,
existing approaches often fail to capture fine-grained facial expressions and
struggle to preserve identity across different expressions. We propose
GEN-AFFECT, a novel framework for personalized avatar generation that generates
expressive and identity-consistent avatars with a diverse set of facial
expressions. Our framework proposes conditioning a multimodal diffusion
transformer on an extracted identity-expression representation. This enables
identity preservation and representation of a wide range of facial expressions.
GEN-AFFECT additionally employs consistent attention at inference for
information sharing across the set of generated expressions, enabling the
generation process to maintain identity consistency over the array of generated
fine-grained expressions. GEN-AFFECT demonstrates superior performance compared
to previous state-of-the-art methods on the basis of the accuracy of the
generated expressions, the preservation of the identity and the consistency of
the target identity across an array of fine-grained facial expressions.

Abstract: Robust fitting of geometric models is a fundamental task in many computer
vision pipelines. Numerous innovations have been produced on the topic, from
improving the efficiency and accuracy of random sampling heuristics to
generating novel theoretical insights that underpin new approaches with
mathematical guarantees. However, one aspect of robust fitting that has
received little attention is energy efficiency. This performance metric has
become critical as high energy consumption is a growing concern for AI
adoption. In this paper, we explore energy-efficient robust fitting via the
neuromorphic computing paradigm. Specifically, we designed a novel spiking
neural network for robust fitting on real neuromorphic hardware, the Intel
Loihi 2. Enabling this are novel event-driven formulations of model estimation
that allow robust fitting to be implemented in the unique architecture of Loihi
2, and algorithmic strategies to alleviate the current limited precision and
instruction set of the hardware. Results show that our neuromorphic robust
fitting consumes only a fraction (15%) of the energy required to run the
established robust fitting algorithm on a standard CPU to equivalent accuracy.

Conclusion: CitySeg通过创新方法显著提升了城市尺度点云语义分割的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of city-scale point clouds is a critical technology for
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) perception systems, enabling the classification
of 3D points without relying on any visual information to achieve comprehensive
3D understanding. However, existing models are frequently constrained by the
limited scale of 3D data and the domain gap between datasets, which lead to
reduced generalization capability. To address these challenges, we propose
CitySeg, a foundation model for city-scale point cloud semantic segmentation
that incorporates text modality to achieve open vocabulary segmentation and
zero-shot inference. Specifically, in order to mitigate the issue of
non-uniform data distribution across multiple domains, we customize the data
preprocessing rules, and propose a local-global cross-attention network to
enhance the perception capabilities of point networks in UAV scenarios. To
resolve semantic label discrepancies across datasets, we introduce a
hierarchical classification strategy. A hierarchical graph established
according to the data annotation rules consolidates the data labels, and the
graph encoder is used to model the hierarchical relationships between
categories. In addition, we propose a two-stage training strategy and employ
hinge loss to increase the feature separability of subcategories. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed CitySeg achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on nine closed-set benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing
approaches. Moreover, for the first time, CitySeg enables zero-shot
generalization in city-scale point cloud scenarios without relying on visual
information.

Motivation: 现实世界中深度伪造检测模型在未知样本上表现不佳，但少量样本可用于改进性能，因此需将其视为少样本任务而非零样本任务。

Method: 提出FTNet，仅需一个伪造样本作为参考，无需训练或参数更新，通过比较测试样本与已知伪造和真实样本的距离进行分类。

Result: 在29种生成模型的图像上测试，FTNet平均性能提升8.7%，达到新SoTA。

Conclusion: 利用失败样本改进少样本检测性能，为深度伪造检测提供了新视角。

Abstract: Recent deepfake detection studies often treat unseen sample detection as a
``zero-shot" task, training on images generated by known models but
generalizing to unknown ones. A key real-world challenge arises when a model
performs poorly on unknown samples, yet these samples remain available for
analysis. This highlights that it should be approached as a ``few-shot" task,
where effectively utilizing a small number of samples can lead to significant
improvement. Unlike typical few-shot tasks focused on semantic understanding,
deepfake detection prioritizes image realism, which closely mirrors real-world
distributions. In this work, we propose the Few-shot Training-free Network
(FTNet) for real-world few-shot deepfake detection. Simple yet effective, FTNet
differs from traditional methods that rely on large-scale known data for
training. Instead, FTNet uses only one fake samplefrom an evaluation set,
mimicking the scenario where new samples emerge in the real world and can be
gathered for use, without any training or parameter updates. During evaluation,
each test sample is compared to the known fake and real samples, and it is
classified based on the category of the nearest sample. We conduct a
comprehensive analysis of AI-generated images from 29 different generative
models and achieve a new SoTA performance, with an average improvement of 8.7\%
compared to existing methods. This work introduces a fresh perspective on
real-world deepfake detection: when the model struggles to generalize on a
few-shot sample, leveraging the failed samples leads to better performance.

Conclusion: MoFE和LFA数据集有效解决了大角度面部视频生成中的身份保持问题，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Current video generation models struggle with identity preservation under
large facial angles, primarily facing two challenges: the difficulty in
exploring an effective mechanism to integrate identity features into DiT
structure, and the lack of targeted coverage of large facial angles in existing
open-source video datasets. To address these, we present two key innovations.
First, we introduce a Mixture of Facial Experts (MoFE) that dynamically
combines complementary cues from three specialized experts, each designed to
capture distinct but mutually reinforcing aspects of facial attributes. The
identity expert captures cross-pose identity-sensitive features, the semantic
expert extracts high-level visual semantxics, and the detail expert preserves
pixel-level features (e.g., skin texture, color gradients). Furthermore, to
mitigate dataset limitations, we have tailored a data processing pipeline
centered on two key aspects: Face Constraints and Identity Consistency. Face
Constraints ensure facial angle diversity and a high proportion of facial
regions, while Identity Consistency preserves coherent person-specific features
across temporal sequences, collectively addressing the scarcity of large facial
angles and identity-stable training data in existing datasets. Leveraging this
pipeline, we have curated and refined a Large Face Angles (LFA) Dataset from
existing open-source human video datasets, comprising 460K video clips with
annotated facial angles. Experimental results on the LFA benchmark demonstrate
that our method, empowered by the LFA dataset, significantly outperforms prior
SOTA methods in face similarity, face FID, and CLIP semantic alignment. The
code and dataset will be made publicly available at

Result: 实验证明该方法对多种图像生成器生成的AI图像检测有效。

Conclusion: 提出的无监督通用检测器在无需AI生成图像的情况下，显著提升了检测性能，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of AI generative models, the visual quality of
AI-generated images (AIIs) has become increasingly close to natural images,
which inevitably raises security concerns. Most AII detectors often employ the
conventional image classification pipeline with natural images and AIIs
(generated by a generative model), which can result in limited detection
performance for AIIs from unseen generative models. To solve this, we proposed
a universal AI-generated image detector from the perspective of anomaly
detection. Our discriminator does not need to access any AIIs and learn a
generalizable representation with unsupervised learning. Specifically, we use
the pre-trained CLIP encoder as the feature extractor and design a normalizing
flow-like unsupervised model. Instead of AIIs, proxy images, e.g., obtained by
applying a spectral modification operation on natural images, are used for
training. Our models are trained by minimizing the likelihood of proxy images,
optionally combined with maximizing the likelihood of natural images. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on AIIs produced by
various image generators.

Conclusion: GazeLT通过有效利用人类视觉注意力模式，显著提升了长尾疾病分类的性能。

Abstract: In this work, we present GazeLT, a human visual attention
integration-disintegration approach for long-tailed disease classification. A
radiologist's eye gaze has distinct patterns that capture both fine-grained and
coarser level disease related information. While interpreting an image, a
radiologist's attention varies throughout the duration; it is critical to
incorporate this into a deep learning framework to improve automated image
interpretation. Another important aspect of visual attention is that apart from
looking at major/obvious disease patterns, experts also look at
minor/incidental findings (few of these constituting long-tailed classes)
during the course of image interpretation. GazeLT harnesses the temporal aspect
of the visual search process, via an integration and disintegration mechanism,
to improve long-tailed disease classification. We show the efficacy of GazeLT
on two publicly available datasets for long-tailed disease classification,
namely the NIH-CXR-LT (n=89237) and the MIMIC-CXR-LT (n=111898) datasets.

TL;DR: SkySplat是一种自监督框架，将RPC模型集成到通用3DGS中，显著提升了稀疏卫星图像的三维重建效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS方法不适用于卫星图像，且通用3DGS在多时相稀疏卫星图像上表现不佳。

Method: SkySplat结合RPC模型，采用自监督学习，利用RGB图像和辐射鲁棒的相对高度监督，无需地面真实高度图。

Result: SkySplat比EOGS快86倍且精度更高，在DFC19数据集上MAE从13.18米降至1.80米，并在MVS3D基准上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: SkySplat为稀疏卫星图像的三维重建提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Three-dimensional scene reconstruction from sparse-view satellite images is a
long-standing and challenging task. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and its
variants have recently attracted attention for its high efficiency, existing
methods remain unsuitable for satellite images due to incompatibility with
rational polynomial coefficient (RPC) models and limited generalization
capability. Recent advances in generalizable 3DGS approaches show potential,
but they perform poorly on multi-temporal sparse satellite images due to
limited geometric constraints, transient objects, and radiometric
inconsistencies. To address these limitations, we propose SkySplat, a novel
self-supervised framework that integrates the RPC model into the generalizable
3DGS pipeline, enabling more effective use of sparse geometric cues for
improved reconstruction. SkySplat relies only on RGB images and
radiometric-robust relative height supervision, thereby eliminating the need
for ground-truth height maps. Key components include a Cross-Self Consistency
Module (CSCM), which mitigates transient object interference via
consistency-based masking, and a multi-view consistency aggregation strategy
that refines reconstruction results. Compared to per-scene optimization
methods, SkySplat achieves an 86 times speedup over EOGS with higher accuracy.
It also outperforms generalizable 3DGS baselines, reducing MAE from 13.18 m to
1.80 m on the DFC19 dataset significantly, and demonstrates strong
cross-dataset generalization on the MVS3D benchmark.

TL;DR: Video-EM框架通过模拟人类情景记忆，解决了Video-LLMs在长视频理解中的关键帧冗余和时空关系缺失问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将长视频简化为静态关键帧匹配，忽略了时空关系和上下文连续性，导致信息冗余和准确性下降。

Method: Video-EM将关键帧建模为时序情景事件，结合空间关系和时序动态，并利用LLMs的链式思维迭代筛选最小但信息量最大的子集。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Video-EM性能提升4-9%，且使用更少帧数。

Conclusion: Video-EM通过情景记忆和链式思维，显著提升了长视频理解的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) excel at general video understanding
but struggle with long-form videos due to context window limits. Consequently,
recent approaches focus on keyframe retrieval, condensing lengthy videos into a
small set of informative frames. Despite their practicality, these methods
simplify the problem to static text image matching, overlooking spatio temporal
relationships crucial for capturing scene transitions and contextual
continuity, and may yield redundant keyframes with limited information,
diluting salient cues essential for accurate video question answering. To
address these limitations, we introduce Video-EM, a training free framework
inspired by the principles of human episodic memory, designed to facilitate
robust and contextually grounded reasoning. Rather than treating keyframes as
isolated visual entities, Video-EM explicitly models them as temporally ordered
episodic events, capturing both spatial relationships and temporal dynamics
necessary for accurately reconstructing the underlying narrative. Furthermore,
the framework leverages chain of thought (CoT) thinking with LLMs to
iteratively identify a minimal yet highly informative subset of episodic
memories, enabling efficient and accurate question answering by Video-LLMs.
Extensive evaluations on the Video-MME, EgoSchema, HourVideo, and LVBench
benchmarks confirm the superiority of Video-EM, which achieves highly
competitive results with performance gains of 4-9 percent over respective
baselines while utilizing fewer frames.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于语义感知重建误差（SARE）的方法，用于检测扩散模型生成的图像，解决了现有方法在面对未见过的生成模型时性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的快速发展引发了对其潜在滥用的担忧，现有检测方法在面对未见过的生成模型时性能显著下降。

Method: 通过测量图像与其基于标题的重建之间的语义差异，提出SARE表示，量化语义变化以区分真假图像。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在GenImage和CommunityForensics等基准测试中表现优于现有基线，具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: SARE作为一种鲁棒特征，能够有效检测多种生成模型生成的假图像。

Abstract: Recently, diffusion-generated image detection has gained increasing
attention, as the rapid advancement of diffusion models has raised serious
concerns about their potential misuse. While existing detection methods have
achieved promising results, their performance often degrades significantly when
facing fake images from unseen, out-of-distribution (OOD) generative models,
since they primarily rely on model-specific artifacts. To address this
limitation, we explore a fundamental property commonly observed in fake images.
Motivated by the observation that fake images tend to exhibit higher similarity
to their captions than real images, we propose a novel representation, namely
Semantic-Aware Reconstruction Error (SARE), that measures the semantic
difference between an image and its caption-guided reconstruction. The
hypothesis behind SARE is that real images, whose captions often fail to fully
capture their complex visual content, may undergo noticeable semantic shifts
during the caption-guided reconstruction process. In contrast, fake images,
which closely align with their captions, show minimal semantic changes. By
quantifying these semantic shifts, SARE can be utilized as a discriminative
feature for robust detection across diverse generative models. We empirically
demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits strong generalization,
outperforming existing baselines on benchmarks including GenImage and
CommunityForensics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法依赖图和语言模型编码器，忽略了关键的几何信息，导致口袋定位和结合构象不准确。

Method: CWFBind在特征提取阶段整合局部曲率描述符，增强几何表示，并引入度感知权重机制和动态半径策略。

Result: CWFBind在多个对接基准测试中表现优异，平衡了准确性和效率。

Conclusion: CWFBind通过几何信息增强和动态策略，显著提升了分子对接的准确性。

Abstract: Accurately predicting the binding conformation of small-molecule ligands to
protein targets is a critical step in rational drug design. Although recent
deep learning-based docking surpasses traditional methods in speed and
accuracy, many approaches rely on graph representations and language
model-inspired encoders while neglecting critical geometric information,
resulting in inaccurate pocket localization and unrealistic binding
conformations. In this study, we introduce CWFBind, a weighted, fast, and
accurate docking method based on local curvature features. Specifically, we
integrate local curvature descriptors during the feature extraction phase to
enrich the geometric representation of both proteins and ligands, complementing
existing chemical, sequence, and structural features. Furthermore, we embed
degree-aware weighting mechanisms into the message passing process, enhancing
the model's ability to capture spatial structural distinctions and interaction
strengths. To address the class imbalance challenge in pocket prediction,
CWFBind employs a ligand-aware dynamic radius strategy alongside an enhanced
loss function, facilitating more precise identification of binding regions and
key residues. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that CWFBind
achieves competitive performance across multiple docking benchmarks, offering a
balanced trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Sign language, which contains hand movements, facial expressions and bodily
gestures, is a significant medium for communicating with hard-of-hearing
people. A well-trained sign language community communicates easily, but those
who don't know sign language face significant challenges. Recognition and
generation are basic communication methods between hearing and hard-of-hearing
individuals. Despite progress in recognition, sign language generation still
needs to be explored. The Progressive Growing of Generative Adversarial Network
(ProGAN) excels at producing high-quality images, while the Self-Attention
Generative Adversarial Network (SAGAN) generates feature-rich images at medium
resolutions. Balancing resolution and detail is crucial for sign language image
generation. We are developing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) variant
that combines both models to generate feature-rich, high-resolution, and
class-conditional sign language images. Our modified Attention-based model
generates high-quality images of Indian Sign Language letters, numbers, and
words, outperforming the traditional ProGAN in Inception Score (IS) and
Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), with improvements of 3.2 and 30.12,
respectively. Additionally, we are publishing a large dataset incorporating
high-quality images of Indian Sign Language alphabets, numbers, and 129 words.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相似物体干扰（SOI）是单目标跟踪（SOT）中被长期忽视的关键瓶颈，亟需系统研究和量化。

Method: 通过在线干扰掩蔽（OIM）实验量化SOI影响，构建SOIBench基准，并利用大规模视觉语言模型（VLM）作为外部认知引擎。

Result: 消除干扰源显著提升跟踪性能（AUC增益达4.35），现有视觉语言跟踪方法效果有限（AUC变化-0.26至+0.71），而VLM方法表现突出（AUC增益达0.93）。

Conclusion: SOIBench为语义认知跟踪研究提供了标准化平台，VLM方法为跟踪领域带来新突破。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first systematic investigation and
quantification of Similar Object Interference (SOI), a long-overlooked yet
critical bottleneck in Single Object Tracking (SOT). Through controlled Online
Interference Masking (OIM) experiments, we quantitatively demonstrate that
eliminating interference sources leads to substantial performance improvements
(AUC gains up to 4.35) across all SOTA trackers, directly validating SOI as a
primary constraint for robust tracking and highlighting the feasibility of
external cognitive guidance. Building upon these insights, we adopt natural
language as a practical form of external guidance, and construct SOIBench-the
first semantic cognitive guidance benchmark specifically targeting SOI
challenges. It automatically mines SOI frames through multi-tracker collective
judgment and introduces a multi-level annotation protocol to generate precise
semantic guidance texts. Systematic evaluation on SOIBench reveals a striking
finding: existing vision-language tracking (VLT) methods fail to effectively
exploit semantic cognitive guidance, achieving only marginal improvements or
even performance degradation (AUC changes of -0.26 to +0.71). In contrast, we
propose a novel paradigm employing large-scale vision-language models (VLM) as
external cognitive engines that can be seamlessly integrated into arbitrary RGB
trackers. This approach demonstrates substantial improvements under semantic
cognitive guidance (AUC gains up to 0.93), representing a significant
advancement over existing VLT methods. We hope SOIBench will serve as a
standardized evaluation platform to advance semantic cognitive tracking
research and contribute new insights to the tracking research community.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SDT的新型视觉Transformer，通过动态数据依赖的空间衰减机制（CAG）改进了传统ViT在空间结构任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ViT的自注意力机制缺乏显式的空间归纳偏置，导致在空间结构任务上表现不佳。现有方法采用固定距离度量的空间衰减，无法适应多样化的视觉场景。

Method: 提出了SDT，引入Context-Aware Gating（CAG）机制，动态生成数据依赖的空间衰减，结合内容相关性和空间邻近性调节注意力。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K分类和生成任务上，SDT表现优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 数据依赖的空间衰减机制为视觉Transformer的空间注意力提供了新范式。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized computer vision, yet their
self-attention mechanism lacks explicit spatial inductive biases, leading to
suboptimal performance on spatially-structured tasks. Existing approaches
introduce data-independent spatial decay based on fixed distance metrics,
applying uniform attention weighting regardless of image content and limiting
adaptability to diverse visual scenarios. Inspired by recent advances in large
language models where content-aware gating mechanisms (e.g., GLA, HGRN2, FOX)
significantly outperform static alternatives, we present the first successful
adaptation of data-dependent spatial decay to 2D vision transformers. We
introduce \textbf{Spatial Decay Transformer (SDT)}, featuring a novel
Context-Aware Gating (CAG) mechanism that generates dynamic, data-dependent
decay for patch interactions. Our approach learns to modulate spatial attention
based on both content relevance and spatial proximity. We address the
fundamental challenge of 1D-to-2D adaptation through a unified spatial-content
fusion framework that integrates manhattan distance-based spatial priors with
learned content representations. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K
classification and generation tasks demonstrate consistent improvements over
strong baselines. Our work establishes data-dependent spatial decay as a new
paradigm for enhancing spatial attention in vision transformers.

Motivation: 现有方法在测量阶段缺乏非相干性，重建阶段缺乏显式测量表示，限制了整体性能。

Method: 提出AKCS模型提高测量非相干性，MACA机制学习隐式测量表示，并集成到展开网络中。

Result: MEUNet在重建精度和推理速度上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: AKCS和MACA的结合显著提升了压缩感知任务的性能。

Abstract: Deep networks have achieved remarkable success in image compressed sensing
(CS) task, namely reconstructing a high-fidelity image from its compressed
measurement. However, existing works are deficient inincoherent compressed
measurement at sensing phase and implicit measurement representations at
reconstruction phase, limiting the overall performance. In this work, we answer
two questions: 1) how to improve the measurement incoherence for decreasing the
ill-posedness; 2) how to learn informative representations from measurements.
To this end, we propose a novel asymmetric Kronecker CS (AKCS) model and
theoretically present its better incoherence than previous Kronecker CS with
minimal complexity increase. Moreover, we reveal that the unfolding networks'
superiority over non-unfolding ones result from sufficient gradient descents,
called explicit measurement representations. We propose a measurement-aware
cross attention (MACA) mechanism to learn implicit measurement representations.
We integrate AKCS and MACA into widely-used unfolding architecture to get a
measurement-enhanced unfolding network (MEUNet). Extensive experiences
demonstrate that our MEUNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in
reconstruction accuracy and inference speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单数据集训练在新数据分布下表现不佳，尤其是在超声图像分析中，由于数据有限、声学阴影和斑点噪声等问题。因此，需要构建一个多异构超声数据集的通用框架。

Method: COME通过建立双结构-语义共享专家，创建通用表示空间，并与源特定专家协作提取区分性特征，提供互补特征以实现鲁棒泛化。

Result: 在三种评估模式（单数据集、器官内和器官间集成数据集）下，COME显著优于现有方法，平均AP提升显著。

Conclusion: COME通过共享和协作机制，有效解决了多数据集训练中的干扰问题，为超声图像分析提供了鲁棒的通用框架。

Abstract: Conventional single-dataset training often fails with new data distributions,
especially in ultrasound (US) image analysis due to limited data, acoustic
shadows, and speckle noise. Therefore, constructing a universal framework for
multi-heterogeneous US datasets is imperative. However, a key challenge arises:
how to effectively mitigate inter-dataset interference while preserving
dataset-specific discriminative features for robust downstream task? Previous
approaches utilize either a single source-specific decoder or a domain
adaptation strategy, but these methods experienced a decline in performance
when applied to other domains. Considering this, we propose a Universal
Collaborative Mixture of Heterogeneous Source-Specific Experts (COME).
Specifically, COME establishes dual structure-semantic shared experts that
create a universal representation space and then collaborate with
source-specific experts to extract discriminative features through providing
complementary features. This design enables robust generalization by leveraging
cross-datasets experience distributions and providing universal US priors for
small-batch or unseen data scenarios. Extensive experiments under three
evaluation modes (single-dataset, intra-organ, and inter-organ integration
datasets) demonstrate COME's superiority, achieving significant mean AP
improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Our project is available at:

Method: 提出COXNet框架，包含三个核心创新：跨层融合模块、动态对齐与尺度细化模块，以及基于GeoShape相似性度量的优化标签分配策略。

Result: 在RGBTDronePerson数据集上，COXNet比现有方法提高了3.32%的mAP$_{50}$。

Conclusion: COXNet在复杂环境中表现出色，为RGBT微小目标检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting tiny objects in multimodal Red-Green-Blue-Thermal (RGBT) imagery is
a critical challenge in computer vision, particularly in surveillance, search
and rescue, and autonomous navigation. Drone-based scenarios exacerbate these
challenges due to spatial misalignment, low-light conditions, occlusion, and
cluttered backgrounds. Current methods struggle to leverage the complementary
information between visible and thermal modalities effectively. We propose
COXNet, a novel framework for RGBT tiny object detection, addressing these
issues through three core innovations: i) the Cross-Layer Fusion Module, fusing
high-level visible and low-level thermal features for enhanced semantic and
spatial accuracy; ii) the Dynamic Alignment and Scale Refinement module,
correcting cross-modal spatial misalignments and preserving multi-scale
features; and iii) an optimized label assignment strategy using the GeoShape
Similarity Measure for better localization. COXNet achieves a 3.32\% mAP$_{50}$
improvement on the RGBTDronePerson dataset over state-of-the-art methods,
demonstrating its effectiveness for robust detection in complex environments.

Motivation: 研究动机是解决现实世界图像数据集在稀有场景和文本-图像对齐方面的不足，探索合成数据的潜力。

Method: 通过GPT-4o生成180K规模的合成数据集Echo-4o-Image，并基于此微调多模态生成模型Bagel。同时提出GenEval++和Imagine-Bench两个新评测基准。

Result: Echo-4o在标准评测中表现优异，且合成数据对其他基础模型（如OmniGen2、BLIP3-o）也有显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 合成图像数据能有效补充现实世界数据集的不足，提升模型性能，且具有强可迁移性。

Abstract: Recently, GPT-4o has garnered significant attention for its strong
performance in image generation, yet open-source models still lag behind.
Several studies have explored distilling image data from GPT-4o to enhance
open-source models, achieving notable progress. However, a key question
remains: given that real-world image datasets already constitute a natural
source of high-quality data, why should we use GPT-4o-generated synthetic data?
In this work, we identify two key advantages of synthetic images. First, they
can complement rare scenarios in real-world datasets, such as surreal fantasy
or multi-reference image generation, which frequently occur in user queries.
Second, they provide clean and controllable supervision. Real-world data often
contains complex background noise and inherent misalignment between text
descriptions and image content, whereas synthetic images offer pure backgrounds
and long-tailed supervision signals, facilitating more accurate text-to-image
alignment. Building on these insights, we introduce Echo-4o-Image, a 180K-scale
synthetic dataset generated by GPT-4o, harnessing the power of synthetic image
data to address blind spots in real-world coverage. Using this dataset, we
fine-tune the unified multimodal generation baseline Bagel to obtain Echo-4o.
In addition, we propose two new evaluation benchmarks for a more accurate and
challenging assessment of image generation capabilities: GenEval++, which
increases instruction complexity to mitigate score saturation, and
Imagine-Bench, which focuses on evaluating both the understanding and
generation of imaginative content. Echo-4o demonstrates strong performance
across standard benchmarks. Moreover, applying Echo-4o-Image to other
foundation models (e.g., OmniGen2, BLIP3-o) yields consistent performance gains
across multiple metrics, highlighting the datasets strong transferability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着非对称多摄像头系统（如广角-长焦摄像头）的普及，传统立体匹配算法基于对称视觉特性的假设不再适用，导致匹配困难。

Method: 通过分析两种成本体积构建方法的匹配成本分布，提出双阶段迭代体积融合网络（IVF-AStereo），先优化相关体积，再融合两种体积以增强细节。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在非对称场景中表现优异，并能有效应对分辨率和颜色退化问题。

Conclusion: IVF-AStereo为非对称立体匹配提供了一种有效的解决方案，通过融合两种成本体积显著提升了匹配性能。

Abstract: Stereo matching is vital in 3D computer vision, with most algorithms assuming
symmetric visual properties between binocular visions. However, the rise of
asymmetric multi-camera systems (e.g., tele-wide cameras) challenges this
assumption and complicates stereo matching. Visual asymmetry disrupts stereo
matching by affecting the crucial cost volume computation. To address this, we
explore the matching cost distribution of two established cost volume
construction methods in asymmetric stereo. We find that each cost volume
experiences distinct information distortion, indicating that both should be
comprehensively utilized to solve the issue. Based on this, we propose the
two-phase Iterative Volume Fusion network for Asymmetric Stereo matching
(IVF-AStereo). Initially, the aggregated concatenation volume refines the
correlation volume. Subsequently, both volumes are fused to enhance fine
details. Our method excels in asymmetric scenarios and shows robust performance
against significant visual asymmetry. Extensive comparative experiments on
benchmark datasets, along with ablation studies, confirm the effectiveness of
our approach in asymmetric stereo with resolution and color degradation.

Result: 在R2R-Goal数据集上表现优异，BLEU-4和CIDEr分数显著提升，并具备跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: GoViG通过纯视觉输入生成精确导航指令，为未知环境下的导航提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Goal-Conditioned Visual Navigation Instruction Generation
(GoViG), a new task that aims to autonomously generate precise and contextually
coherent navigation instructions solely from egocentric visual observations of
initial and goal states. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on structured
inputs such as semantic annotations or environmental maps, GoViG exclusively
leverages raw egocentric visual data, substantially improving its adaptability
to unseen and unstructured environments. Our method addresses this task by
decomposing it into two interconnected subtasks: (1) visual forecasting, which
predicts intermediate visual states bridging the initial and goal views; and
(2) instruction generation, which synthesizes linguistically coherent
instructions grounded in both observed and anticipated visuals. These subtasks
are integrated within an autoregressive multimodal large language model trained
with tailored objectives to ensure spatial accuracy and linguistic clarity.
Furthermore, we introduce two complementary multimodal reasoning strategies,
one-pass and interleaved reasoning, to mimic incremental human cognitive
processes during navigation. To evaluate our method, we propose the R2R-Goal
dataset, combining diverse synthetic and real-world trajectories. Empirical
results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods,
achieving superior BLEU-4 and CIDEr scores along with robust cross-domain
generalization.

Abstract: In this paper, we address a key scientific problem in machine learning: Given
a training set for an image classification task, can we train a generative
model on this dataset to enhance the classification performance? (i.e.,
closed-set generative data augmentation). We start by exploring the
distinctions and similarities between real images and closed-set synthetic
images generated by advanced generative models. Through extensive experiments,
we offer systematic insights into the effective use of closed-set synthetic
data for augmentation. Notably, we empirically determine the equivalent scale
of synthetic images needed for augmentation. In addition, we also show
quantitative equivalence between the real data augmentation and open-set
generative augmentation (generative models trained using data beyond the given
training set). While it aligns with the common intuition that real images are
generally preferred, our empirical formulation also offers a guideline to
quantify the increased scale of synthetic data augmentation required to achieve
comparable image classification performance. Our results on natural and medical
image datasets further illustrate how this effect varies with the baseline
training set size and the amount of synthetic data incorporated.

Abstract: Objective - This study presents a biometric identification method based on
topological invariants from 2D iris images, representing iris texture via
formally defined digital homology and evaluating classification performance.
  Methods - Each normalized iris image (48x482 pixels) is divided into grids
(e.g., 6x54 or 3x27). For each subregion, we compute Betti0, Betti1, and their
ratio using a recent algorithm for homology groups in 2D digital images. The
resulting invariants form a feature matrix used with logistic regression, KNN,
and SVM (with PCA and 100 randomized repetitions). A convolutional neural
network (CNN) is trained on raw images for comparison.
  Results - Logistic regression achieved 97.78 +/- 0.82% accuracy,
outperforming CNN (96.44 +/- 1.32%) and other feature-based models. The
topological features showed high accuracy with low variance.
  Conclusion - This is the first use of topological invariants from formal
digital homology for iris recognition. The method offers a compact,
interpretable, and accurate alternative to deep learning, useful when
explainability or limited data is important. Beyond iris recognition, it can
apply to other biometrics, medical imaging, materials science, remote sensing,
and interpretable AI. It runs efficiently on CPU-only systems and produces
robust, explainable features valuable for security-critical domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WeatherPrompt提出了一种多模态学习框架，通过融合图像嵌入与文本上下文，建立天气不变的表示，解决了无人机视觉地理定位在天气扰动下的性能下降问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有方法在天气扰动（如雨、雾）下性能显著下降，主要受限于对有限天气类别的依赖以及场景-天气特征解耦不足。

Method: WeatherPrompt结合训练免费天气推理机制和多模态动态门控机制，通过文本嵌入自适应重加权和融合视觉特征，并利用跨模态目标优化框架。

Result: 在多样天气条件下，该方法在无人机地理定位任务中表现优异，Recall@1在夜间条件下提升13.37%，在雾和雪条件下提升18.69%。

Conclusion: WeatherPrompt通过多模态融合和动态门控机制，显著提升了无人机在复杂天气条件下的地理定位性能。

Abstract: Visual geo-localization for drones faces critical degradation under weather
perturbations, \eg, rain and fog, where existing methods struggle with two
inherent limitations: 1) Heavy reliance on limited weather categories that
constrain generalization, and 2) Suboptimal disentanglement of entangled
scene-weather features through pseudo weather categories. We present
WeatherPrompt, a multi-modality learning paradigm that establishes
weather-invariant representations through fusing the image embedding with the
text context. Our framework introduces two key contributions: First, a
Training-free Weather Reasoning mechanism that employs off-the-shelf large
multi-modality models to synthesize multi-weather textual descriptions through
human-like reasoning. It improves the scalability to unseen or complex weather,
and could reflect different weather strength. Second, to better disentangle the
scene and weather feature, we propose a multi-modality framework with the
dynamic gating mechanism driven by the text embedding to adaptively reweight
and fuse visual features across modalities. The framework is further optimized
by the cross-modal objectives, including image-text contrastive learning and
image-text matching, which maps the same scene with different weather
conditions closer in the respresentation space. Extensive experiments validate
that, under diverse weather conditions, our method achieves competitive recall
rates compared to state-of-the-art drone geo-localization methods. Notably, it
improves Recall@1 by +13.37\% under night conditions and by 18.69\% under fog
and snow conditions.

Motivation: 当前多曝光校正方法在应对复杂光照条件时存在局限性，尤其是单曝光图像的处理中易出现曝光异常和细节丢失问题。

Method: 提出WEC-DG方法，结合退化描述符（ECAM模块）和小波变换（EDRM模块），分别处理曝光一致性和细节重建。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法性能优于现有算法，显著提升了校正效果。

Conclusion: WEC-DG方法在复杂光照条件下具有高效性和实用性，为多曝光校正提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multi-exposure correction technology is essential for restoring images
affected by insufficient or excessive lighting, enhancing the visual experience
by improving brightness, contrast, and detail richness. However, current
multi-exposure correction methods often encounter challenges in addressing
intra-class variability caused by diverse lighting conditions, shooting
environments, and weather factors, particularly when processing images captured
at a single exposure level. To enhance the adaptability of these models under
complex imaging conditions, this paper proposes a Wavelet-based Exposure
Correction method with Degradation Guidance (WEC-DG). Specifically, we
introduce a degradation descriptor within the Exposure Consistency Alignment
Module (ECAM) at both ends of the processing pipeline to ensure exposure
consistency and achieve final alignment. This mechanism effectively addresses
miscorrected exposure anomalies caused by existing methods' failure to
recognize 'blurred' exposure degradation. Additionally, we investigate the
light-detail decoupling properties of the wavelet transform to design the
Exposure Restoration and Detail Reconstruction Module (EDRM), which processes
low-frequency information related to exposure enhancement before utilizing
high-frequency information as a prior guide for reconstructing spatial domain
details. This serial processing strategy guarantees precise light correction
and enhances detail recovery. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple
public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing
algorithms, achieving significant performance improvements and validating its
effectiveness and practical applicability.

Conclusion: CoD框架通过结合诊断对话和病灶定位，显著提升了放射学报告生成的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Despite the progress of radiology report generation (RRG), existing works
face two challenges: 1) The performances in clinical efficacy are
unsatisfactory, especially for lesion attributes description; 2) the generated
text lacks explainability, making it difficult for radiologists to trust the
results. To address the challenges, we focus on a trustworthy RRG model, which
not only generates accurate descriptions of abnormalities, but also provides
basis of its predictions. To this end, we propose a framework named chain of
diagnosis (CoD), which maintains a chain of diagnostic process for clinically
accurate and explainable RRG. It first generates question-answer (QA) pairs via
diagnostic conversation to extract key findings, then prompts a large language
model with QA diagnoses for accurate generation. To enhance explainability, a
diagnosis grounding module is designed to match QA diagnoses and generated
sentences, where the diagnoses act as a reference. Moreover, a lesion grounding
module is designed to locate abnormalities in the image, further improving the
working efficiency of radiologists. To facilitate label-efficient training, we
propose an omni-supervised learning strategy with clinical consistency to
leverage various types of annotations from different datasets. Our efforts lead
to 1) an omni-labeled RRG dataset with QA pairs and lesion boxes; 2) a
evaluation tool for assessing the accuracy of reports in describing lesion
location and severity; 3) extensive experiments to demonstrate the
effectiveness of CoD, where it outperforms both specialist and generalist
models consistently on two RRG benchmarks and shows promising explainability by
accurately grounding generated sentences to QA diagnoses and images.

Method: DRF系统通过外观反馈和生成反馈递归优化中间潜在表示，以更好地反映外观信息和用户意图。

Result: 实验表明，DRF能生成高质量、语义连贯且结构一致的图像，支持跨类别结构-外观融合。

Conclusion: DRF有效解决了可控T2I模型的局限性，提升了生成图像的精细度和一致性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in controllable text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models,
such as Ctrl-X and FreeControl, have demonstrated robust spatial and appearance
control without requiring auxiliary module training. However, these models
often struggle to accurately preserve spatial structures and fail to capture
fine-grained conditions related to object poses and scene layouts. To address
these challenges, we propose a training-free Dual Recursive Feedback (DRF)
system that properly reflects control conditions in controllable T2I models.
The proposed DRF consists of appearance feedback and generation feedback that
recursively refines the intermediate latents to better reflect the given
appearance information and the user's intent. This dual-update mechanism guides
latent representations toward reliable manifolds, effectively integrating
structural and appearance attributes. Our approach enables fine-grained
generation even between class-invariant structure-appearance fusion, such as
transferring human motion onto a tiger's form. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the efficacy of our method in producing high-quality, semantically
coherent, and structurally consistent image generations. Our source code is
available at https://github.com/jwonkm/DRF.

Motivation: 现有研究对幻觉问题的评估较为粗糙，且依赖手动或公共数据集，缺乏可扩展性和多样性。

Method: 提出自动化数据构建流程和分层幻觉诱导框架，构建SHALE基准，包含30K+图像-指令对。

Result: 实验发现主流模型存在显著的事实性幻觉，并对语义扰动高度敏感。

Conclusion: SHALE基准为幻觉问题提供了细粒度和可扩展的评估方案。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) still suffer
from hallucinations, i.e., generating content inconsistent with input or
established world knowledge, which correspond to faithfulness and factuality
hallucinations, respectively. Prior studies primarily evaluate faithfulness
hallucination at a coarse level (e.g., object-level) and lack fine-grained
analysis. Additionally, existing benchmarks rely on costly manual curation or
reused public datasets, raising concerns about scalability and data leakage. To
address these limitations, we propose an automated data construction pipeline
that produces scalable, controllable, and diverse evaluation data. We also
design a hierarchical hallucination induction framework with input
perturbations to simulate realistic noisy scenarios. Integrating these designs,
we construct SHALE, a Scalable HALlucination Evaluation benchmark designed to
assess both faithfulness and factuality hallucinations via a fine-grained
hallucination categorization scheme. SHALE comprises over 30K image-instruction
pairs spanning 12 representative visual perception aspects for faithfulness and
6 knowledge domains for factuality, considering both clean and noisy scenarios.
Extensive experiments on over 20 mainstream LVLMs reveal significant factuality
hallucinations and high sensitivity to semantic perturbations.

along with shape estimation to provide annotation labels on the detection level
under various supervision levels. Simultaneously, the framework provides
evaluation of tracking performance and label annotation. If manually labeled
data is available, each processing module can be analyzed independently or
combined with other modules to enable closed-loop continuous improvements. The
framework performance is evaluated in a challenging urban real-world scenario
in terms of tracking performance and the label annotation errors. We

Conclusion: Hi-SMGNN通过分层和多尺度交互，显著提升了IDH突变预测的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Isocitrate DeHydrogenase (IDH) mutation status is a crucial biomarker for
glioma prognosis. However, current prediction methods are limited by the low
availability and noise of functional MRI. Structural and morphological
connectomes offer a non-invasive alternative, yet existing approaches often
ignore the brain's hierarchical organisation and multiscale interactions. To
address this, we propose Hi-SMGNN, a hierarchical framework that integrates
structural and morphological connectomes from regional to modular levels. It
features a multimodal interaction module with a Siamese network and cross-modal
attention, a multiscale feature fusion mechanism for reducing redundancy, and a
personalised modular partitioning strategy to enhance individual specificity
and interpretability. Experiments on the UCSF-PDGM dataset demonstrate that
Hi-SMGNN outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art models, showing improved
robustness and effectiveness in IDH mutation prediction.

Result: 在NeRSemble数据集上实现高保真渲染，首次支持高斯头像的显式纹理编辑。

Conclusion: SVG-Head为头像建模提供了高质量和实时编辑的新方法。

Abstract: Creating high-fidelity and editable head avatars is a pivotal challenge in
computer vision and graphics, boosting many AR/VR applications. While recent
advancements have achieved photorealistic renderings and plausible animation,
head editing, especially real-time appearance editing, remains challenging due
to the implicit representation and entangled modeling of the geometry and
global appearance. To address this, we propose Surface-Volumetric Gaussian Head
Avatar (SVG-Head), a novel hybrid representation that explicitly models the
geometry with 3D Gaussians bound on a FLAME mesh and leverages disentangled
texture images to capture the global appearance. Technically, it contains two
types of Gaussians, in which surface Gaussians explicitly model the appearance
of head avatars using learnable texture images, facilitating real-time texture
editing, while volumetric Gaussians enhance the reconstruction quality of
non-Lambertian regions (e.g., lips and hair). To model the correspondence
between 3D world and texture space, we provide a mesh-aware Gaussian UV mapping
method, which leverages UV coordinates given by the FLAME mesh to obtain sharp
texture images and real-time rendering speed. A hierarchical optimization
strategy is further designed to pursue the optimal performance in both
reconstruction quality and editing flexibility. Experiments on the NeRSemble
dataset show that SVG-Head not only generates high-fidelity rendering results,
but also is the first method to obtain explicit texture images for Gaussian
head avatars and support real-time appearance editing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在类到图像生成中虽FID分数高，但某些类别图像质量差，因FID忽略单样本感知质量。CFG技术虽提升指标但引入分布偏移和视觉伪影。

Method: 提出FaME，无需训练且高效推理，利用图像质量评估模型识别低质量生成，存储其采样轨迹作为负引导，避免低质量区域。

Result: 在ImageNet上实验显示，FaME显著提升视觉质量且不损害FID，并有望扩展至文本到图像生成。

Conclusion: FaME通过负引导提升感知质量，为扩散模型生成提供了一种有效且通用的改进方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in class-to-image
generation. However, we observe that despite impressive FID scores,
state-of-the-art models often generate distorted or low-quality images,
especially in certain classes. This gap arises because FID evaluates global
distribution alignment, while ignoring the perceptual quality of individual
samples. We further examine the role of CFG, a common technique used to enhance
generation quality. While effective in improving metrics and suppressing
outliers, CFG can introduce distribution shift and visual artifacts due to its
misalignment with both training objectives and user expectations. In this work,
we propose FaME, a training-free and inference-efficient method for improving
perceptual quality. FaME uses an image quality assessment model to identify
low-quality generations and stores their sampling trajectories. These failure
modes are then used as negative guidance to steer future sampling away from
poor-quality regions. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that FaME brings
consistent improvements in visual quality without compromising FID. FaME also
shows the potential to be extended to improve text-to-image generation.

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，BridgeTA比纯相机基线提高了4.2% mIoU，优于其他最先进的知识蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: BridgeTA通过教师助理网络和理论推导的蒸馏损失，有效提升了纯相机模型的性能，同时保持低成本。

Abstract: Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) map segmentation is one of the most important and
challenging tasks in autonomous driving. Camera-only approaches have drawn
attention as cost-effective alternatives to LiDAR, but they still fall behind
LiDAR-Camera (LC) fusion-based methods. Knowledge Distillation (KD) has been
explored to narrow this gap, but existing methods mainly enlarge the student
model by mimicking the teacher's architecture, leading to higher inference
cost. To address this issue, we introduce BridgeTA, a cost-effective
distillation framework to bridge the representation gap between LC fusion and
Camera-only models through a Teacher Assistant (TA) network while keeping the
student's architecture and inference cost unchanged. A lightweight TA network
combines the BEV representations of the teacher and student, creating a shared
latent space that serves as an intermediate representation. To ground the
framework theoretically, we derive a distillation loss using Young's
Inequality, which decomposes the direct teacher-student distillation path into
teacher-TA and TA-student dual paths, stabilizing optimization and
strengthening knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on the challenging
nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving an
improvement of 4.2% mIoU over the Camera-only baseline, up to 45% higher than
the improvement of other state-of-the-art KD methods.

Abstract: We present MInDI-3D (Medical Inversion by Direct Iteration in 3D), the first
3D conditional diffusion-based model for real-world sparse-view Cone Beam
Computed Tomography (CBCT) artefact removal, aiming to reduce imaging radiation
exposure. A key contribution is extending the "InDI" concept from 2D to a full
3D volumetric approach for medical images, implementing an iterative denoising
process that refines the CBCT volume directly from sparse-view input. A further
contribution is the generation of a large pseudo-CBCT dataset (16,182) from
chest CT volumes of the CT-RATE public dataset to robustly train MInDI-3D. We
performed a comprehensive evaluation, including quantitative metrics,
scalability analysis, generalisation tests, and a clinical assessment by 11
clinicians. Our results show MInDI-3D's effectiveness, achieving a 12.96 (6.10)
dB PSNR gain over uncorrected scans with only 50 projections on the CT-RATE
pseudo-CBCT (independent real-world) test set and enabling an 8x reduction in
imaging radiation exposure. We demonstrate its scalability by showing that
performance improves with more training data. Importantly, MInDI-3D matches the
performance of a 3D U-Net on real-world scans from 16 cancer patients across
distortion and task-based metrics. It also generalises to new CBCT scanner
geometries. Clinicians rated our model as sufficient for patient positioning
across all anatomical sites and found it preserved lung tumour boundaries well.

Conclusion: 提出的信息优化框架能有效减少误检，提升平面检测的准确性，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: Plane detection from depth images is a crucial subtask with broad robotic
applications, often accomplished by iterative methods such as Random Sample
Consensus (RANSAC). While RANSAC is a robust strategy with strong probabilistic
guarantees, the ambiguity of its inlier threshold criterion makes it
susceptible to false positive plane detections. This issue is particularly
prevalent in complex real-world scenes, where the true number of planes is
unknown and multiple planes coexist. In this paper, we aim to address this
limitation by proposing a generalised framework for plane detection based on
model information optimization. Building on previous works, we treat the
observed depth readings as discrete random variables, with their probability
distributions constrained by the ground truth planes. Various models containing
different candidate plane constraints are then generated through repeated
random sub-sampling to explain our observations. By incorporating the physics
and noise model of the depth sensor, we can calculate the information for each
model, and the model with the least information is accepted as the most likely
ground truth. This information optimization process serves as an objective
mechanism for determining the true number of planes and preventing false
positive detections. Additionally, the quality of each detected plane can be
ranked by summing the information reduction of inlier points for each plane. We
validate these properties through experiments with synthetic data and find that
our algorithm estimates plane parameters more accurately compared to the
default Open3D RANSAC plane segmentation. Furthermore, we accelerate our
algorithm by partitioning the depth map using neural network segmentation,
which enhances its ability to generate more realistic plane parameters in
real-world data.

Conclusion: SAD-Splat为3D航空场景理解提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: In the task of 3D Aerial-view Scene Semantic Segmentation (3D-AVS-SS),
traditional methods struggle to address semantic ambiguity caused by scale
variations and structural occlusions in aerial images. This limits their
segmentation accuracy and consistency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
novel 3D-AVS-SS approach named SAD-Splat. Our method introduces a Gaussian
point drop module, which integrates semantic confidence estimation with a
learnable sparsity mechanism based on the Hard Concrete distribution. This
module effectively eliminates redundant and semantically ambiguous Gaussian
points, enhancing both segmentation performance and representation compactness.
Furthermore, SAD-Splat incorporates a high-confidence pseudo-label generation
pipeline. It leverages 2D foundation models to enhance supervision when
ground-truth labels are limited, thereby further improving segmentation
accuracy. To advance research in this domain, we introduce a challenging
benchmark dataset: 3D Aerial Semantic (3D-AS), which encompasses diverse
real-world aerial scenes with sparse annotations. Experimental results
demonstrate that SAD-Splat achieves an excellent balance between segmentation
accuracy and representation compactness. It offers an efficient and scalable
solution for 3D aerial scene understanding.

Abstract: We revisit the role of texture in monocular 3D hand reconstruction, not as an
afterthought for photorealism, but as a dense, spatially grounded cue that can
actively support pose and shape estimation. Our observation is simple: even in
high-performing models, the overlay between predicted hand geometry and image
appearance is often imperfect, suggesting that texture alignment may be an
underused supervisory signal. We propose a lightweight texture module that
embeds per-pixel observations into UV texture space and enables a novel dense
alignment loss between predicted and observed hand appearances. Our approach
assumes access to a differentiable rendering pipeline and a model that maps
images to 3D hand meshes with known topology, allowing us to back-project a
textured hand onto the image and perform pixel-based alignment. The module is
self-contained and easily pluggable into existing reconstruction pipelines. To
isolate and highlight the value of texture-guided supervision, we augment
HaMeR, a high-performing yet unadorned transformer architecture for 3D hand
pose estimation. The resulting system improves both accuracy and realism,
demonstrating the value of appearance-guided alignment in hand reconstruction.

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型受限于上下文窗口、视频时长、风格多样性和领域知识表示不足。

Method: 采用自上而下分解、总结和重构论文，再自下而上生成视频，结合渐进式思维链（P-CoT）进行规划。

Result: 在五个研究领域成功生成高质量视频摘要，表现优于现有模型。

Conclusion: Preacher系统在论文到视频任务中表现出色，代码将开源。

Abstract: The paper-to-video task converts a research paper into a structured video
abstract, distilling key concepts, methods, and conclusions into an accessible,
well-organized format. While state-of-the-art video generation models
demonstrate potential, they are constrained by limited context windows, rigid
video duration constraints, limited stylistic diversity, and an inability to
represent domain-specific knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce
Preacher, the first paper-to-video agentic system. Preacher employs a top-down
approach to decompose, summarize, and reformulate the paper, followed by
bottom-up video generation, synthesizing diverse video segments into a coherent
abstract. To align cross-modal representations, we define key scenes and
introduce a Progressive Chain of Thought (P-CoT) for granular, iterative
planning. Preacher successfully generates high-quality video abstracts across
five research fields, demonstrating expertise beyond current video generation
models. Code will be released at: https://github.com/GenVerse/Paper2Video

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声图像的低对比度和模糊纹理细节限制了胎儿躯干平面的精确识别，影响产前诊断的可靠性。

Method: 设计了MCFM模块，通过在不同对比条件下分配注意力权重，增强特征提取能力，同时保持低参数开销。

Result: 在胎儿躯干平面超声图像数据集上，MCFM显著提高了识别性能，且模型复杂度增加极小。

Conclusion: MCFM通过多对比度融合增强特征表示，为产前筛查提供了更准确可靠的诊断工具，具有临床推广潜力。

Abstract: Purpose: Prenatal ultrasound is a key tool in evaluating fetal structural
development and detecting abnormalities, contributing to reduced perinatal
complications and improved neonatal survival. Accurate identification of
standard fetal torso planes is essential for reliable assessment and
personalized prenatal care. However, limitations such as low contrast and
unclear texture details in ultrasound imaging pose significant challenges for
fine-grained anatomical recognition. Methods: We propose a novel Multi-Contrast
Fusion Module (MCFM) to enhance the model's ability to extract detailed
information from ultrasound images. MCFM operates exclusively on the lower
layers of the neural network, directly processing raw ultrasound data. By
assigning attention weights to image representations under different contrast
conditions, the module enhances feature modeling while explicitly maintaining
minimal parameter overhead. Results: The proposed MCFM was evaluated on a
curated dataset of fetal torso plane ultrasound images. Experimental results
demonstrate that MCFM substantially improves recognition performance, with a
minimal increase in model complexity. The integration of multi-contrast
attention enables the model to better capture subtle anatomical structures,
contributing to higher classification accuracy and clinical reliability.
Conclusions: Our method provides an effective solution for improving fetal
torso plane recognition in ultrasound imaging. By enhancing feature
representation through multi-contrast fusion, the proposed approach supports
clinicians in achieving more accurate and consistent diagnoses, demonstrating
strong potential for clinical adoption in prenatal screening. The codes are

Result: 在三个独立临床中心验证了PG-SAM的先进性能。

Conclusion: PG-SAM展示了临床适用性，并验证了诊断文本对图像分割的增强效果。

Abstract: Parotid gland lesion segmentation is essential for the treatment of parotid
gland diseases. However, due to the variable size and complex lesion
boundaries, accurate parotid gland lesion segmentation remains challenging.
Recently, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) fine-tuning has shown remarkable
performance in the field of medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, SAM's
interaction segmentation model relies heavily on precise lesion prompts
(points, boxes, masks, etc.), which are very difficult to obtain in real-world
applications. Besides, current medical image segmentation methods are
automatically generated, ignoring the domain knowledge of medical experts when
performing segmentation. To address these limitations, we propose the parotid
gland segment anything model (PG-SAM), an expert diagnosis text-guided SAM
incorporating expert domain knowledge for cross-sequence parotid gland lesion
segmentation. Specifically, we first propose an expert diagnosis report guided
prompt generation module that can automatically generate prompt information
containing the prior domain knowledge to guide the subsequent lesion
segmentation process. Then, we introduce a cross-sequence attention module,
which integrates the complementary information of different modalities to
enhance the segmentation effect. Finally, the multi-sequence image features and
generated prompts are feed into the decoder to get segmentation result.
Experimental results demonstrate that PG-SAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance in parotid gland lesion segmentation across three independent
clinical centers, validating its clinical applicability and the effectiveness
of diagnostic text for enhancing image segmentation in real-world clinical
settings.

Conclusion: ReMIND2Reg旨在推动稳健、可推广且临床可用的多模态配准算法发展。

Abstract: Accurate intraoperative image guidance is critical for achieving maximal safe
resection in brain tumor surgery, yet neuronavigation systems based on
preoperative MRI lose accuracy during the procedure due to brain shift.
Aligning post-resection intraoperative ultrasound (iUS) with preoperative MRI
can restore spatial accuracy by estimating brain shift deformations, but it
remains a challenging problem given the large anatomical and topological
changes and substantial modality intensity gap. The ReMIND2Reg 2025 Challenge
provides the largest public benchmark for this task, built upon the ReMIND
dataset. It offers 99 training cases, 5 validation cases, and 10 private test
cases comprising paired 3D ceT1 MRI, T2 MRI, and post-resection 3D iUS volumes.
Data are provided without annotations for training, while validation and test
performance are evaluated on manually annotated anatomical landmarks. Metrics
include target registration error (TRE), robustness to worst-case landmark
misalignment (TRE30), and runtime. By establishing a standardized evaluation
framework for this clinically critical and technically complex problem,
ReMIND2Reg aims to accelerate the development of robust, generalizable, and
clinically deployable multimodal registration algorithms for image-guided
neurosurgery.

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上验证了方法的有效性，尤其在快速扫描和稀疏照明点数据中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂场景下的NLOS成像提供了可行解决方案，兼具高精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Computational imaging, especially non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging, the
extraction of information from obscured or hidden scenes is achieved through
the utilization of indirect light signals resulting from multiple reflections
or scattering. The inherently weak nature of these signals, coupled with their
susceptibility to noise, necessitates the integration of physical processes to
ensure accurate reconstruction. This paper presents a parameterized inverse
problem framework tailored for large-scale linear problems in 3D imaging
reconstruction. Initially, a noise estimation module is employed to adaptively
assess the noise levels present in transient data. Subsequently, a
parameterized neural operator is developed to approximate the inverse mapping,
facilitating end-to-end rapid image reconstruction. Our 3D image reconstruction
framework, grounded in operator learning, is constructed through deep algorithm
unfolding, which not only provides commendable model interpretability but also
enables dynamic adaptation to varying noise levels in the acquired data,
thereby ensuring consistently robust and accurate reconstruction outcomes.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel method for the fusion of global and local
spatiotemporal data features. By integrating structural and detailed
information, this method significantly enhances both accuracy and robustness.
Comprehensive numerical experiments conducted on both simulated and real
datasets substantiate the efficacy of the proposed method. It demonstrates
remarkable performance with fast scanning data and sparse illumination point
data, offering a viable solution for NLOS imaging in complex scenarios.

Motivation: 解决现有身份条件扩散模型在生成数据时缺乏类间分离机制的问题，避免身份重叠，提升人脸识别系统的性能。

Method: 提出NegFaceDiff方法，在身份条件扩散过程中加入负条件，明确引导模型远离不需要的特征，同时保持类内一致性。

Result: 实验表明，NegFaceDiff将身份可分离性（FDR）从2.427提升到5.687，训练出的FR模型在多个基准测试中表现更优。

Conclusion: NegFaceDiff通过负条件采样显著提升了生成数据的质量，为人脸识别系统的训练提供了更优的数据来源。

Abstract: The use of synthetic data as an alternative to authentic datasets in face
recognition (FR) development has gained significant attention, addressing
privacy, ethical, and practical concerns associated with collecting and using
authentic data. Recent state-of-the-art approaches have proposed
identity-conditioned diffusion models to generate identity-consistent face
images, facilitating their use in training FR models. However, these methods
often lack explicit sampling mechanisms to enforce inter-class separability,
leading to identity overlap in the generated data and, consequently, suboptimal
FR performance. In this work, we introduce NegFaceDiff, a novel sampling method
that incorporates negative conditions into the identity-conditioned diffusion
process. NegFaceDiff enhances identity separation by leveraging negative
conditions that explicitly guide the model away from unwanted features while
preserving intra-class consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
NegFaceDiff significantly improves the identity consistency and separability of
data generated by identity-conditioned diffusion models. Specifically, identity
separability, measured by the Fisher Discriminant Ratio (FDR), increases from
2.427 to 5.687. These improvements are reflected in FR systems trained on the
NegFaceDiff dataset, which outperform models trained on data generated without
negative conditions across multiple benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图重建3D场景时信息不足导致明显伪影，现有生成先验方法难以保持与输入观测的一致性。

Method: 基于DiT的视频扩散模型，结合2D语义和3D几何特征，利用参考视图修复伪影。

Result: GSFixer在3DGS伪影修复和稀疏视图3D重建中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GSFixer通过多特征整合有效提升3DGS重建质量，并提供了新的评估基准DL3DV-Res。

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from sparse views
is an ill-posed problem due to insufficient information, often resulting in
noticeable artifacts. While recent approaches have sought to leverage
generative priors to complete information for under-constrained regions, they
struggle to generate content that remains consistent with input observations.
To address this challenge, we propose GSFixer, a novel framework designed to
improve the quality of 3DGS representations reconstructed from sparse inputs.
The core of our approach is the reference-guided video restoration model, built
upon a DiT-based video diffusion model trained on paired artifact 3DGS renders
and clean frames with additional reference-based conditions. Considering the
input sparse views as references, our model integrates both 2D semantic
features and 3D geometric features of reference views extracted from the visual
geometry foundation model, enhancing the semantic coherence and 3D consistency
when fixing artifact novel views. Furthermore, considering the lack of suitable
benchmarks for 3DGS artifact restoration evaluation, we present DL3DV-Res which
contains artifact frames rendered using low-quality 3DGS. Extensive experiments
demonstrate our GSFixer outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in 3DGS
artifact restoration and sparse-view 3D reconstruction. Project page:

Result: 在STIR和SCARE数据集上，2D跟踪精度提升50%，3D跟踪首次超越前馈方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在手术场景中实现了高效的2D和3D点跟踪，为TTO领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We proposed a novel test-time optimisation (TTO) approach framed by a
NeRF-based architecture for long-term 3D point tracking. Most current methods
in point tracking struggle to obtain consistent motion or are limited to 2D
motion. TTO approaches frame the solution for long-term tracking as optimising
a function that aggregates correspondences from other specialised
state-of-the-art methods. Unlike the state-of-the-art on TTO, we propose
parametrising such a function with our new invertible Neural Radiance Field
(InvNeRF) architecture to perform both 2D and 3D tracking in surgical
scenarios. Our approach allows us to exploit the advantages of a
rendering-based approach by supervising the reprojection of pixel
correspondences. It adapts strategies from recent rendering-based methods to
obtain a bidirectional deformable-canonical mapping, to efficiently handle a
defined workspace, and to guide the rays' density. It also presents our
multi-scale HexPlanes for fast inference and a new algorithm for efficient
pixel sampling and convergence criteria. We present results in the STIR and
SCARE datasets, for evaluating point tracking and testing the integration of
kinematic data in our pipeline, respectively. In 2D point tracking, our
approach surpasses the precision and accuracy of the TTO state-of-the-art
methods by nearly 50% on average precision, while competing with other
approaches. In 3D point tracking, this is the first TTO approach, surpassing
feed-forward methods while incorporating the benefits of a deformable
NeRF-based reconstruction.

Conclusion: 该工作推动了面部表示学习，提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案，减少了对昂贵标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: Facial representation pre-training is crucial for tasks like facial
recognition, expression analysis, and virtual reality. However, existing
methods face three key challenges: (1) failing to capture distinct facial
features and fine-grained semantics, (2) ignoring the spatial structure
inherent to facial anatomy, and (3) inefficiently utilizing limited labeled
data. To overcome these, we introduce PaCo-FR, an unsupervised framework that
combines masked image modeling with patch-pixel alignment. Our approach
integrates three innovative components: (1) a structured masking strategy that
preserves spatial coherence by aligning with semantically meaningful facial
regions, (2) a novel patch-based codebook that enhances feature discrimination
with multiple candidate tokens, and (3) spatial consistency constraints that
preserve geometric relationships between facial components. PaCo-FR achieves
state-of-the-art performance across several facial analysis tasks with just 2
million unlabeled images for pre-training. Our method demonstrates significant
improvements, particularly in scenarios with varying poses, occlusions, and
lighting conditions. We believe this work advances facial representation
learning and offers a scalable, efficient solution that reduces reliance on
expensive annotated datasets, driving more effective facial analysis systems.

Conclusion: SAFF通过Slot Attention有效过滤无关特征，提升了少样本分类性能。

Abstract: Irrelevant features can significantly degrade few-shot learn ing performance.
This problem is used to match queries and support images based on meaningful
similarities despite the limited data. However, in this process, non-relevant
fea tures such as background elements can easily lead to confu sion and
misclassification. To address this issue, we pro pose Slot Attention-based
Feature Filtering for Few-Shot Learning (SAFF) that leverages slot attention
mechanisms to discriminate and filter weak features, thereby improving few-shot
classification performance. The key innovation of SAFF lies in its integration
of slot attention with patch em beddings, unifying class-aware slots into a
single attention mechanism to filter irrelevant features effectively. We intro
duce a similarity matrix that computes across support and query images to
quantify the relevance of filtered embed dings for classification. Through
experiments, we demon strate that Slot Attention performs better than other
atten tion mechanisms, capturing discriminative features while reducing
irrelevant information. We validate our approach through extensive experiments
on few-shot learning bench marks: CIFAR-FS, FC100, miniImageNet and tieredIma
geNet, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 在两个基准数据集上显著优于现有方法，定性和定量评估均表现优异。

Conclusion: MangaDiT通过内部注意力机制有效提升参考引导线稿着色的区域级颜色一致性。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved the
performance of reference-guided line art colorization. However, existing
methods still struggle with region-level color consistency, especially when the
reference and target images differ in character pose or motion. Instead of
relying on external matching annotations between the reference and target, we
propose to discover semantic correspondences implicitly through internal
attention mechanisms. In this paper, we present MangaDiT, a powerful model for
reference-guided line art colorization based on Diffusion Transformers (DiT).
Our model takes both line art and reference images as conditional inputs and
introduces a hierarchical attention mechanism with a dynamic attention
weighting strategy. This mechanism augments the vanilla attention with an
additional context-aware path that leverages pooled spatial features,
effectively expanding the model's receptive field and enhancing region-level
color alignment. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving
superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: NEURAL通过任务无关的数据资产，解决了数据大小与临床效用之间的权衡，支持高效工作流程和远程放射学。

Abstract: The rapid growth of multimodal medical imaging data presents significant
storage and transmission challenges, particularly in resource-constrained
clinical settings. We propose NEURAL, a novel framework that addresses this by
using semantics-guided data compression. Our approach repurposes
cross-attention scores between the image and its radiological report from a
fine-tuned generative vision-language model to structurally prune chest X-rays,
preserving only diagnostically critical regions. This process transforms the
image into a highly compressed, graph representation. This unified graph-based
representation fuses the pruned visual graph with a knowledge graph derived
from the clinical report, creating a universal data structure that simplifies
downstream modeling. Validated on the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus dataset for
pneumonia detection, NEURAL achieves a 93.4-97.7\% reduction in image data size
while maintaining a high diagnostic performance of 0.88-0.95 AUC, outperforming
other baseline models that use uncompressed data. By creating a persistent,
task-agnostic data asset, NEURAL resolves the trade-off between data size and
clinical utility, enabling efficient workflows and teleradiology without
sacrificing performance. Our NEURAL code is available at

Abstract: Glioblastoma is a highly invasive brain tumor with rapid progression rates.
Recent studies have shown that glioblastoma molecular subtype classification
serves as a significant biomarker for effective targeted therapy selection.
However, this classification currently requires invasive tissue extraction for
comprehensive histopathological analysis. Existing multimodal approaches
combining MRI and histopathology images are limited and lack robust mechanisms
for preserving shared structural information across modalities. In particular,
graph-based models often fail to retain discriminative features within
heterogeneous graphs, and structural reconstruction mechanisms for handling
missing or incomplete modality data are largely underexplored. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel sheaf-based framework for structure-aware and
consistent fusion of MRI and histopathology data. Our model outperforms

Abstract: Recent advances in data-driven computer vision have enabled robust autonomous
navigation capabilities for civil aviation, including automated landing and
runway detection. However, ensuring that these systems meet the robustness and
safety requirements for aviation applications remains a major challenge. In
this work, we present a practical vision-based pipeline for aircraft pose
estimation from runway images that represents a step toward the ability to
certify these systems for use in safety-critical aviation applications. Our
approach features three key innovations: (i) an efficient, flexible neural
architecture based on a spatial Soft Argmax operator for probabilistic keypoint
regression, supporting diverse vision backbones with real-time inference; (ii)
a principled loss function producing calibrated predictive uncertainties, which
are evaluated via sharpness and calibration metrics; and (iii) an adaptation of
Residual-based Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM), enabling
runtime detection and rejection of faulty model outputs. We implement and
evaluate our pose estimation pipeline on a dataset of runway images. We show
that our model outperforms baseline architectures in terms of accuracy while
also producing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates with sub-pixel precision
that can be used downstream for fault detection.

TL;DR: M3-Agent是一种新型多模态代理框架，具备长期记忆能力，能处理实时视觉和听觉输入，并通过强化学习在基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在开发一种更接近人类长期记忆能力的多模态代理，以提升其在复杂任务中的理解和推理能力。

Method: 采用实体为中心的多模态记忆格式，结合强化学习训练，并在新开发的长视频问答基准M3-Bench上进行评估。

Result: M3-Agent在M3-Bench-robot、M3-Bench-web和VideoMME-long上分别比基线模型高出6.7%、7.7%和5.3%的准确率。

Conclusion: M3-Agent在多模态代理的长期记忆和实际应用设计方面取得了显著进展。

Abstract: We introduce M3-Agent, a novel multimodal agent framework equipped with
long-term memory. Like humans, M3-Agent can process real-time visual and
auditory inputs to build and update its long-term memory. Beyond episodic
memory, it also develops semantic memory, enabling it to accumulate world
knowledge over time. Its memory is organized in an entity-centric, multimodal
format, allowing deeper and more consistent understanding of the environment.
Given an instruction, M3-Agent autonomously performs multi-turn, iterative
reasoning and retrieves relevant information from memory to accomplish the
task. To evaluate memory effectiveness and memory-based reasoning in multimodal
agents, we develop M3-Bench, a new long-video question answering benchmark.
M3-Bench comprises 100 newly recorded real-world videos captured from a robot's
perspective (M3-Bench-robot) and 929 web-sourced videos across diverse
scenarios (M3-Bench-web). We annotate question-answer pairs designed to test
key capabilities essential for agent applications, such as human understanding,
general knowledge extraction, and cross-modal reasoning. Experimental results
show that M3-Agent, trained via reinforcement learning, outperforms the
strongest baseline, a prompting agent using Gemini-1.5-pro and GPT-4o,
achieving 6.7%, 7.7%, and 5.3% higher accuracy on M3-Bench-robot, M3-Bench-web
and VideoMME-long, respectively. Our work advances the multimodal agents toward
more human-like long-term memory and provides insights into their practical
design. Model, code and data are available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于区域到区域转换（R2R）的图像和谐化方法，通过Clear-VAE和Harmony Controller提升细节保留与和谐化能力，并构建了新的合成数据集RPHarmony。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于潜在扩散模型（LDM）的和谐化方法在细节保留和复杂光照条件下表现不足，且合成数据集缺乏多样性。

Method: 设计了Clear-VAE保留前景高频细节，引入Harmony Controller动态调整前景；提出Random Poisson Blending构建多样化数据集RPHarmony。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在定量指标和视觉和谐性上优于其他方法，且数据集能生成更真实的图像。

Conclusion: R2R方法显著提升了图像和谐化效果，RPHarmony数据集为模型训练提供了更丰富的数据支持。

Abstract: The goal of image harmonization is to adjust the foreground in a composite
image to achieve visual consistency with the background. Recently, latent
diffusion model (LDM) are applied for harmonization, achieving remarkable
results. However, LDM-based harmonization faces challenges in detail
preservation and limited harmonization ability. Additionally, current synthetic
datasets rely on color transfer, which lacks local variations and fails to
capture complex real-world lighting conditions. To enhance harmonization
capabilities, we propose the Region-to-Region transformation. By injecting
information from appropriate regions into the foreground, this approach
preserves original details while achieving image harmonization or, conversely,
generating new composite data. From this perspective, We propose a novel model
R2R. Specifically, we design Clear-VAE to preserve high-frequency details in
the foreground using Adaptive Filter while eliminating disharmonious elements.
To further enhance harmonization, we introduce the Harmony Controller with
Mask-aware Adaptive Channel Attention (MACA), which dynamically adjusts the
foreground based on the channel importance of both foreground and background
regions. To address the limitation of existing datasets, we propose Random
Poisson Blending, which transfers color and lighting information from a
suitable region to the foreground, thereby generating more diverse and
challenging synthetic images. Using this method, we construct a new synthetic
dataset, RPHarmony. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over
other methods in both quantitative metrics and visual harmony. Moreover, our
dataset helps the model generate more realistic images in real examples. Our
code, dataset, and model weights have all been released for open access.

Motivation: 解决密集大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）计算成本高的问题，并探索稀疏混合专家（MoE）架构在多模态任务中的应用。

Method: 引入MoIIE，通过模态引导的路由机制，分别处理模态内和模态间特征，并采用两阶段训练策略。

Result: 在5.5B和11.3B激活参数下，MoIIE模型性能优于现有开源多模态MoE模型。

Conclusion: MoIIE方法在提升参数效率的同时，保持了高性能，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
across multi-modal tasks by scaling model size and training data. However,
these dense LVLMs incur significant computational costs and motivate the
exploration of sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures. While MoE improve
parameter efficiency, effectively applying MoE to simultaneously model
modality-specific features and cross-modal associations in LVLMs remains
challenging. In this work, we propose to incorporate Mixture of Intra- and
Inter-Modality Experts (MoIIE) to LVLMs. For each token, expert routing is
guided by its modality, directing tokens to their respective intra-modality
experts as well as a shared pool of inter-modality experts, enabling the model
to jointly learn rich intra-modal features and cross-modal interactions. We
further introduce an effective and straightforward two-stage training strategy,
which facilitates the direct activation of both MoE and multi-modal
capabilities. Extensive experiments across different data scales and LLM
backbone demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and generality of our
approach. Notably, our MoIIE models with 5.5B and 11.3B activated parameters
match or even surpass the performance of existing advanced open-source MoE-LLMs
based multi-modal models that involve more activated parameters. The code is

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在几何装配基准测试中表现优异，显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 组合匹配方法通过建模互锁形状的特性，实现了更鲁棒的部件组合，为几何装配提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new shape-matching methodology, combinative matching,
to combine interlocking parts for geometric shape assembly. Previous methods
for geometric assembly typically rely on aligning parts by finding identical
surfaces between the parts as in conventional shape matching and registration.
In contrast, we explicitly model two distinct properties of interlocking
shapes: 'identical surface shape' and 'opposite volume occupancy.' Our method
thus learns to establish correspondences across regions where their surface
shapes appear identical but their volumes occupy the inverted space to each
other. To facilitate this process, we also learn to align regions in rotation
by estimating their shape orientations via equivariant neural networks. The
proposed approach significantly reduces local ambiguities in matching and
allows a robust combination of parts in assembly. Experimental results on
geometric assembly benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our method,
consistently outperforming the state of the art. Project page:

Method: 提出DSS-Prompt方法，结合静态提示和动态提示：静态提示用于弥合预训练与下游任务的领域差距，动态提示用于捕捉实例感知语义。动态提示通过多模态模型生成输入相关的语义，并在不同层自适应调整重要性。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，DSS-Prompt表现优于现有方法，有效缓解了灾难性遗忘问题。

Conclusion: DSS-Prompt通过提示微调预训练模型，在少样本类增量学习中取得了显著效果，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Learning from large-scale pre-trained models with strong generalization
ability has shown remarkable success in a wide range of downstream tasks
recently, but it is still underexplored in the challenging few-shot
class-incremental learning (FSCIL) task. It aims to continually learn new
concepts from limited training samples without forgetting the old ones at the
same time. In this paper, we introduce DSS-Prompt, a simple yet effective
approach that transforms the pre-trained Vision Transformer with minimal
modifications in the way of prompts into a strong FSCIL classifier. Concretely,
we synergistically utilize two complementary types of prompts in each
Transformer block: static prompts to bridge the domain gap between the
pre-training and downstream datasets, thus enabling better adaption; and
dynamic prompts to capture instance-aware semantics, thus enabling easy
transfer from base to novel classes. Specially, to generate dynamic prompts, we
leverage a pre-trained multi-modal model to extract input-related diverse
semantics, thereby generating complementary input-aware prompts, and then
adaptively adjust their importance across different layers. In this way, on top
of the prompted visual embeddings, a simple prototype classifier can beat
state-of-the-arts without further training on the incremental tasks. We conduct
extensive experiments on four benchmarks to validate the effectiveness of our
DSS-Prompt and show that it consistently achieves better performance than
existing approaches on all datasets and can alleviate the catastrophic
forgetting issue as well.

TL;DR: MeMoSORT是一种实时多目标跟踪方法，通过改进卡尔曼滤波和自适应IoU匹配，解决了复杂运动和遮挡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统跟踪方法依赖卡尔曼滤波和刚性IoU匹配，在复杂运动和遮挡下表现不佳。

Method: 提出MeKF（记忆辅助卡尔曼滤波）和Mo-IoU（运动自适应IoU）改进跟踪性能。

Result: 在DanceTrack和SportsMOT上HOTA得分分别为67.9%和82.1%，达到SOTA。

Conclusion: MeMoSORT在复杂场景下表现优异，且轻量高效。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in human-dominant scenarios, which involves
continuously tracking multiple people within video sequences, remains a
significant challenge in computer vision due to targets' complex motion and
severe occlusions. Conventional tracking-by-detection methods are fundamentally
limited by their reliance on Kalman filter (KF) and rigid Intersection over
Union (IoU)-based association. The motion model in KF often mismatches
real-world object dynamics, causing filtering errors, while rigid association
struggles under occlusions, leading to identity switches or target loss. To
address these issues, we propose MeMoSORT, a simple, online, and real-time MOT
tracker with two key innovations. First, the Memory-assisted Kalman filter
(MeKF) uses memory-augmented neural networks to compensate for mismatches
between assumed and actual object motion. Second, the Motion-adaptive IoU
(Mo-IoU) adaptively expands the matching space and incorporates height
similarity to reduce the influence of detection errors and association
failures, while remaining lightweight. Experiments on DanceTrack and SportsMOT
show that MeMoSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance, with HOTA scores of
67.9\% and 82.1\%, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SISR方法在PBR材料超分辨率中存在跨图不一致性、模态特征建模不足和数据分布偏移导致的泛化能力有限问题。

Method: MUJICA是一种灵活的适配器，基于预训练的Swin-transformer SISR模型，通过跨图注意力融合特征，同时保留预训练模型的优秀重建能力。

Result: MUJICA在PSNR、SSIM和LPIPS指标上表现优异，同时保持了跨图一致性，且在有限资源下也能高效训练。

Conclusion: MUJICA在PBR材料超分辨率任务中实现了最先进的性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials are typically characterized by
multiple 2D texture maps such as basecolor, normal, metallic, and roughness
which encode spatially-varying bi-directional reflectance distribution function
(SVBRDF) parameters to model surface reflectance properties and microfacet
interactions. Upscaling SVBRDF material is valuable for modern 3D graphics
applications. However, existing Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) methods
struggle with cross-map inconsistency, inadequate modeling of modality-specific
features, and limited generalization due to data distribution shifts. In this
work, we propose Multi-modal Upscaling Joint Inference via Cross-map Attention
(MUJICA), a flexible adapter that reforms pre-trained Swin-transformer-based
SISR models for PBR material super-resolution. MUJICA is seamlessly attached
after the pre-trained and frozen SISR backbone. It leverages cross-map
attention to fuse features while preserving remarkable reconstruction ability
of the pre-trained SISR model. Applied to SISR models such as SwinIR, DRCT, and
HMANet, MUJICA improves PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS scores while preserving cross-map
consistency. Experiments demonstrate that MUJICA enables efficient training
even with limited resources and delivers state-of-the-art performance on PBR
material datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 常规脑组织照片的分割目前需要昂贵的手动干预，限制了其在大规模研究中的应用。

Method: 使用U-Net架构，结合1,414张手动标注的图像和2,000张合成的MRI图像进行训练，以提高模型的泛化能力。

Result: 模型在未见过的照片上表现优异，Dice分数中位数超过0.98，接近人工标注的精度。

Conclusion: 该工具公开可用，为脑组织照片的自动化分割提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Advances in image registration and machine learning have recently enabled
volumetric analysis of \emph{postmortem} brain tissue from conventional
photographs of coronal slabs, which are routinely collected in brain banks and
neuropathology laboratories worldwide. One caveat of this methodology is the
requirement of segmentation of the tissue from photographs, which currently
requires costly manual intervention. In this article, we present a deep
learning model to automate this process. The automatic segmentation tool relies
on a U-Net architecture that was trained with a combination of
\textit{(i)}1,414 manually segmented images of both fixed and fresh tissue,
from specimens with varying diagnoses, photographed at two different sites; and
\textit{(ii)}~2,000 synthetic images with randomized contrast and corresponding
masks generated from MRI scans for improved generalizability to unseen
photographic setups. Automated model predictions on a subset of photographs not
seen in training were analyzed to estimate performance compared to manual
labels -- including both inter- and intra-rater variability. Our model achieved
a median Dice score over 0.98, mean surface distance under 0.4~mm, and 95\%
Hausdorff distance under 1.60~mm, which approaches inter-/intra-rater levels.

Motivation: 现有方法通过物理约束或简单物理模型难以学习复杂运动物理，且常需额外标签（如物体类型或掩码）。

Method: 将每个3D点视为具有大小和方向的刚性粒子，直接学习其平移旋转动力学系统，并估计物理参数以控制粒子运动。

Result: 在三个现有动态数据集和一个新合成数据集上，TRACE在帧外推任务中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: TRACE不仅能建模复杂运动物理，还能通过聚类物理参数轻松分割多个物体或部分。

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to model 3D scene geometry, appearance, and physical
information just from dynamic multi-view videos in the absence of any human
labels. By leveraging physics-informed losses as soft constraints or
integrating simple physics models into neural nets, existing works often fail
to learn complex motion physics, or doing so requires additional labels such as
object types or masks. We propose a new framework named TRACE to model the
motion physics of complex dynamic 3D scenes. The key novelty of our method is
that, by formulating each 3D point as a rigid particle with size and
orientation in space, we directly learn a translation rotation dynamics system
for each particle, explicitly estimating a complete set of physical parameters
to govern the particle's motion over time. Extensive experiments on three
existing dynamic datasets and one newly created challenging synthetic datasets
demonstrate the extraordinary performance of our method over baselines in the
task of future frame extrapolation. A nice property of our framework is that
multiple objects or parts can be easily segmented just by clustering the
learned physical parameters.

Abstract: Elephant Poaching in African countries has been a decade-old problem. So much
so that African Forest Elephants are now listed as an endangered species, and
African Savannah Elephants as critically endangered by the IUCN (International
Union for Conservation of Nature). [1] Elephants are hunted primarily for their
ivory tusks which caused many elephants to be born tuskless as a genetic
modification for survival. [2] Data gathered by recent studies shows that
though poaching methods remain the same, the poaching grounds are rather
dynamic. Poachers have shifted to areas with less ranger patrols and several
other factors like watering holes, seasons, altitude etc. cause constant shifts
in poaching hotspot locations. [3] After a period of low poaching from
2000-2014, poaching numbers in African countries are now on the rise again --
WWF (World Wildlife Foundation) says there are 20,000 elephants poached
annually [4]. In African countries, anti-poaching efforts are concentrated near
towns, while a majority of poaching occurs in the deserted regions. All of
these factors result in the need for a Computer Vision Model to identify
poaching hotspots through locating the geographic indicators of favorable
poaching regions. A CV model eliminates the need to manually track poachers and
account for the environmental factors to deploy resources and its combination
with satellite imagery allows us to survey large areas without disturbing local
species or cross border aviation restrictions.

Method: 通过分析形状-纹理偏差和噪声下的分类准确率变化，研究CLIP的学习机制。

Result: CLIP初期学习低层次视觉特征，与人类感知对齐，但噪声敏感；后期转向抽象形状表示，提高鲁棒性但降低感知对齐。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了CLIP学习机制中的权衡，为优化视觉-语言模型的感知对齐与鲁棒性提供了新见解。

Abstract: During the training of multi-modal models like CLIP, we observed an
intriguing phenomenon: the correlation with low-level human image quality
assessments peaks in the early epochs before gradually declining. This study
investigates this observation and seeks to understand its causes through two
key factors: shape-texture bias alignment and classification accuracy drop
under noise. Our findings suggest that CLIP initially learn low-level visual
features, enhancing its alignment with low-level human perception but also
increasing its sensitivity to noise and its texture bias. As training
progresses, the model shifts toward more abstract shape-based representations,
improving noise robustness but reducing alignment with low-level human
perception. These results suggest that these factors shared an underlying
learning mechanism and provide new insights into optimizing the trade-off
between perceptual alignment and robustness in vision-language models.

Conclusion: 结合视频和运动数据的联合训练策略能更全面地理解人类行为，ViMoNet展示了其有效性。

Abstract: This study investigates how large language models (LLMs) can be used to
understand human behavior using motion and video data. We think that mixing
both types is essential to completely capture the nuanced movements and
meanings of human actions, in contrast to recent models that simply concentrate
on motion data or films. To address this, we provide ViMoNet, a straightforward
yet effective framework for comprehending, characterizing, and deducing human
action. ViMoNet employs a joint training strategy that leverages the advantages
of two data types: detailed motion-text data, which is more exact, and generic
video-text data, which is more comprehensive but less detailed. This aids in
the model's acquisition of rich data regarding time and space in human
behavior. Additionally, we provide a brand new dataset named VIMOS that
contains a variety of films, motion sequences, instructions, and subtitles. We
developed ViMoNet-Bench, a standardized benchmark with carefully labeled
samples, to evaluate how well models understand human behavior. Our tests show
that ViMoNet outperforms existing methods in caption generation, motion
understanding, and behavior interpretation.

Abstract: The scarcity of manipulation data has motivated the use of pretrained large
models from other modalities in robotics. In this work, we build upon
autoregressive video generation models to propose a Physical Autoregressive
Model (PAR), where physical tokens combine frames and actions to represent the
joint evolution of the robot and its environment. PAR leverages the world
knowledge embedded in video pretraining to understand physical dynamics without
requiring action pretraining, enabling accurate video prediction and consistent
action trajectories. It also adopts a DiT-based de-tokenizer to model frames
and actions as continuous tokens, mitigating quantization errors and
facilitating mutual enhancement. Furthermore, we incorporate a causal mask with
inverse kinematics, parallel training, and the KV-cache mechanism to further
improve performance and efficiency. Experiments on the ManiSkill benchmark show
that PAR achieves a 100\% success rate on the PushCube task, matches the
performance of action-pretrained baselines on other tasks, and accurately
predicts future videos with tightly aligned action trajectories. These findings
underscore a promising direction for robotic manipulation by transferring world
knowledge from autoregressive video pretraining.

### [147] [Reverse Convolution and Its Applications to Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09824)
*Xuhong Huang,Shiqi Liu,Kai Zhang,Ying Tai,Jian Yang,Hui Zeng,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型深度反向卷积算子，用于有效反转深度卷积，并通过实验验证其在图像恢复任务中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统转置卷积并非卷积的真正逆运算，缺乏标准化的反向卷积算子，限制了神经网络架构的设计和应用。

Method: 通过正则化最小二乘优化问题设计深度反向卷积算子，并结合层归一化、1×1卷积和GELU激活构建反向卷积块。

Result: 实验表明，提出的反向卷积算子作为基础模块有效，ConverseNet在去噪、超分辨率和去模糊任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该工作为深度学习模型设计中的新算子开发提供了新思路，有望推动相关应用的发展。

Abstract: Convolution and transposed convolution are fundamental operators widely used
in neural networks. However, transposed convolution (a.k.a. deconvolution) does
not serve as a true inverse of convolution due to inherent differences in their
mathematical formulations. To date, no reverse convolution operator has been
established as a standard component in neural architectures. In this paper, we
propose a novel depthwise reverse convolution operator as an initial attempt to
effectively reverse depthwise convolution by formulating and solving a
regularized least-squares optimization problem. We thoroughly investigate its
kernel initialization, padding strategies, and other critical aspects to ensure
its effective implementation. Building upon this operator, we further construct
a reverse convolution block by combining it with layer normalization,
1$\times$1 convolution, and GELU activation, forming a Transformer-like
structure. The proposed operator and block can directly replace conventional
convolution and transposed convolution layers in existing architectures,
leading to the development of ConverseNet. Corresponding to typical image
restoration models such as DnCNN, SRResNet and USRNet, we train three variants
of ConverseNet for Gaussian denoising, super-resolution and deblurring,
respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed reverse convolution operator as a basic building module. We hope this
work could pave the way for developing new operators in deep model design and
applications.

*Shenxing Wei,Jinxi Li,Yafei Yang,Siyuan Zhou,Bo Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RayletDF的新方法，用于从点云或3D高斯分布中重建3D表面，通过射线距离场直接预测表面点，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于坐标的方法在渲染显式表面时计算量大，需要更高效且通用的解决方案。

Method: 提出RayletDF方法，包含射线特征提取器、射线距离场预测器和多射线混合器三个模块，用于提取几何特征、预测距离并聚合结果。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上表现出色，具有优异的泛化能力，能在未见数据集上单次前向传播重建3D表面。

Conclusion: RayletDF方法在3D表面重建中高效且通用，适用于点云或3D高斯输入。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a generalizable method for 3D surface
reconstruction from raw point clouds or pre-estimated 3D Gaussians by 3DGS from
RGB images. Unlike existing coordinate-based methods which are often
computationally intensive when rendering explicit surfaces, our proposed
method, named RayletDF, introduces a new technique called raylet distance
field, which aims to directly predict surface points from query rays. Our
pipeline consists of three key modules: a raylet feature extractor, a raylet
distance field predictor, and a multi-raylet blender. These components work
together to extract fine-grained local geometric features, predict raylet
distances, and aggregate multiple predictions to reconstruct precise surface
points. We extensively evaluate our method on multiple public real-world
datasets, demonstrating superior performance in surface reconstruction from
point clouds or 3D Gaussians. Most notably, our method achieves exceptional
generalization ability, successfully recovering 3D surfaces in a single-forward
pass across unseen datasets in testing.

*Hao Yang,Xu Zhang,Jiaqi Ma,Linwei Zhu,Yun Zhang,Huan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图神经网络的OIQA框架，通过显式建模视口间的结构关系来提升空间失真非均匀性的感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的全向图像质量评估（OIQA）方法在评估局部非均匀失真时表现不佳，主要由于对质量空间变化的建模不足以及对局部细节和全局上下文特征表示的低效。

Method: 采用斐波那契球采样生成具有良好拓扑结构的视口，每个视口作为图节点；通过多阶段特征提取网络获取高维节点表示；结合图注意力网络（GAT）和图变换器分别建模局部和长程质量依赖关系。

Result: 在两个大规模OIQA数据库上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有方法，验证了其有效性和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架通过显式建模空间依赖关系，显著提升了OIQA的性能，尤其在处理复杂空间失真时表现出色。

Abstract: Current Omnidirectional Image Quality Assessment (OIQA) methods struggle to
evaluate locally non-uniform distortions due to inadequate modeling of spatial
variations in quality and ineffective feature representation capturing both
local details and global context. To address this, we propose a graph neural
network-based OIQA framework that explicitly models structural relationships
between viewports to enhance perception of spatial distortion non-uniformity.
Our approach employs Fibonacci sphere sampling to generate viewports with
well-structured topology, representing each as a graph node. Multi-stage
feature extraction networks then derive high-dimensional node representation.
To holistically capture spatial dependencies, we integrate a Graph Attention
Network (GAT) modeling fine-grained local distortion variations among adjacent
viewports, and a graph transformer capturing long-range quality interactions
across distant regions. Extensive experiments on two large-scale OIQA databases
with complex spatial distortions demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches, confirming its effectiveness and strong
generalization capability.

Method: 比较了UNet和DiT的无条件生成，采用LoRA微调预训练模型，结合InfoNCE损失和SegFormer分割编码器优化属性引导合成。

Result: 结果表明，对比嵌入学习和高级分割编码在小数据环境下显著提升了人脸生成的可控性和语义对齐。

Conclusion: 研究证明了对比学习和先进分割编码在小规模数据集上提升人脸生成效果的潜力。

Abstract: We present a benchmark of diffusion models for human face generation on a
small-scale CelebAMask-HQ dataset, evaluating both unconditional and
conditional pipelines. Our study compares UNet and DiT architectures for
unconditional generation and explores LoRA-based fine-tuning of pretrained
Stable Diffusion models as a separate experiment. Building on the
multi-conditioning approach of Giambi and Lisanti, which uses both attribute
vectors and segmentation masks, our main contribution is the integration of an
InfoNCE loss for attribute embedding and the adoption of a SegFormer-based
segmentation encoder. These enhancements improve the semantic alignment and
controllability of attribute-guided synthesis. Our results highlight the
effectiveness of contrastive embedding learning and advanced segmentation
encoding for controlled face generation in limited data settings.

TL;DR: ARI3D是一款用于交互式分析X射线CT图像区域的软件工具，旨在改进相位识别、考虑部分体积效应、提高检测限和准确性，并实现跨学科定量3D分析的标准化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: X射线CT成像技术存在固有成像伪影（如束硬化和部分体积效应），导致对材料内部微观结构的定量分析需要用户基于体素灰度值做出多步决策。

Method: 开发ARI3D软件工具，通过交互式协议辅助用户完成三维图像中区域的分类和量化步骤。

Result: ARI3D能够改进相位识别、处理部分体积效应、提高检测限和量化准确性，并支持跨学科应用。

Conclusion: ARI3D为X射线CT图像的定量分析提供了一种高效、标准化的解决方案，适用于多学科研究。

Abstract: X-ray computed tomography (CT) is the main 3D technique for imaging the
internal microstructures of materials. Quantitative analysis of the
microstructures is usually achieved by applying a sequence of steps that are
implemented to the entire 3D image. This is challenged by various imaging
artifacts inherent from the technique, e.g., beam hardening and partial volume.
Consequently, the analysis requires users to make a number of decisions to
segment and classify the microstructures based on the voxel gray-values. In
this context, a software tool, here called ARI3D, is proposed to interactively
analyze regions in three-dimensional X-ray CT images, assisting users through
the various steps of a protocol designed to classify and quantify objects
within regions of a three-dimensional image. ARI3D aims to 1) Improve phase
identification; 2) Account for partial volume effect; 3) Increase the detection
limit and accuracy of object quantification; and 4) Harmonize quantitative 3D
analysis that can be implemented in different fields of science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索ViTs在图像识别任务中与人类感知的对齐情况，以了解模型复杂性和训练策略对其影响。

Method: 在TID2013数据集上系统分析模型大小、数据集大小、数据增强和正则化对ViT与人类感知对齐的影响。

Result: 发现更大的模型对齐性更低，数据集多样性影响小，但重复训练会降低对齐性；更强的数据增强和正则化进一步减少对齐性。

Conclusion: 模型复杂性、训练策略与人类感知对齐之间存在权衡，对需要类人视觉理解的应用有重要启示。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve remarkable performance in image
recognition tasks, yet their alignment with human perception remains largely
unexplored. This study systematically analyzes how model size, dataset size,
data augmentation and regularization impact ViT perceptual alignment with human
judgments on the TID2013 dataset. Our findings confirm that larger models
exhibit lower perceptual alignment, consistent with previous works. Increasing
dataset diversity has a minimal impact, but exposing models to the same images
more times reduces alignment. Stronger data augmentation and regularization
further decrease alignment, especially in models exposed to repeated training
cycles. These results highlight a trade-off between model complexity, training
strategies, and alignment with human perception, raising important
considerations for applications requiring human-like visual understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散视频VAE存在训练不稳定、时间长和重建质量差的问题，而连续VAE训练更简单且性能优越，因此希望通过结合两者优势提升离散VAE的性能。

Method: 1. 利用FSQ保留连续VAE先验；2. 引入多令牌量化机制提升重建质量；3. 强化首帧重建以改善高压缩视频VAE的性能；4. 提出联合离散-连续优化方案。

Result: OneVAE训练速度更快，性能优于从头训练的离散VAE，PSNR提升近1 dB，并在高压缩视频VAE中表现优异。

Conclusion: OneVAE成功统一了连续和离散表示，首次在单一网络中实现两者竞争性性能。

Abstract: Encoding videos into discrete tokens could align with text tokens to
facilitate concise and unified multi-modal LLMs, yet introducing significant
spatiotemporal compression compared to continuous video representation.
Previous discrete video VAEs experienced unstable training, long training time,
and degraded reconstruction quality. Given the easier training and superior
performance of continuous VAEs, an intuitive idea is to enhance discrete video
VAEs by leveraging continuous VAEs. After rethinking the intrinsic link between
discrete and continuous representations, we found that FSQ could effectively
preserve pre-trained continuous VAE priors compared to other quantization
methods. By leveraging continuous VAE priors, it converges several times faster
than training from scratch and achieves superior performance at convergence.
Meanwhile, two structural improvements are proposed. First, inspired by how
continuous VAEs enhance reconstruction via enlarged latent dimensions, we
introduce a multi-token quantization mechanism, which achieves nearly a 1 dB
improvement in PSNR without compromising the token compression ratio. Second,
to tackle reconstruction challenges in high-compression video VAEs, we
strengthen first-frame reconstruction, enabling the causal VAE to leverage this
information in subsequent frames and markedly improving the performance of 4 x
16 x 16 discrete VAEs. Furthermore, we propose a joint discrete-continuous
optimization scheme that unifies the two paradigms and, for the first time,
achieves competitive performance on both continuous and discrete
representations within a single network. We name our method OneVAE to reflect
this connection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在3D建模和细节保留上存在几何不一致和重建粗糙的问题，同时在运动泛化和场景协调上表现不足。

Method: HumanGenesis整合几何和生成建模，包括Reconstructor、Critique Agent、Pose Guider和Video Harmonizer四个代理。

Result: 在文本引导合成、视频重演和新姿势泛化等任务上达到最先进性能，显著提升了表现力、几何保真度和场景整合。

Conclusion: HumanGenesis通过协作代理解决了现有挑战，为合成人类动态提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: \textbf{Synthetic human dynamics} aims to generate photorealistic videos of
human subjects performing expressive, intention-driven motions. However,
current approaches face two core challenges: (1) \emph{geometric inconsistency}
and \emph{coarse reconstruction}, due to limited 3D modeling and detail
preservation; and (2) \emph{motion generalization limitations} and \emph{scene
inharmonization}, stemming from weak generative capabilities. To address these,
we present \textbf{HumanGenesis}, a framework that integrates geometric and
generative modeling through four collaborative agents: (1)
\textbf{Reconstructor} builds 3D-consistent human-scene representations from
monocular video using 3D Gaussian Splatting and deformation decomposition. (2)
\textbf{Critique Agent} enhances reconstruction fidelity by identifying and
refining poor regions via multi-round MLLM-based reflection. (3) \textbf{Pose
Guider} enables motion generalization by generating expressive pose sequences
using time-aware parametric encoders. (4) \textbf{Video Harmonizer} synthesizes
photorealistic, coherent video via a hybrid rendering pipeline with diffusion,
refining the Reconstructor through a Back-to-4D feedback loop. HumanGenesis
achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks including text-guided synthesis,
video reenactment, and novel-pose generalization, significantly improving
expressiveness, geometric fidelity, and scene integration.

Conclusion: 该方法为多视角事件流重建提供了一种新思路，适用于快速场景捕捉。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis and 4D reconstruction techniques predominantly rely on
RGB cameras, thereby inheriting inherent limitations such as the dependence on
adequate lighting, susceptibility to motion blur, and a limited dynamic range.
Event cameras, offering advantages of low power, high temporal resolution and
high dynamic range, have brought a new perspective to addressing the scene
reconstruction challenges in high-speed motion and low-light scenes. To this
end, we propose E-4DGS, the first event-driven dynamic Gaussian Splatting
approach, for novel view synthesis from multi-view event streams with
fast-moving cameras. Specifically, we introduce an event-based initialization
scheme to ensure stable training and propose event-adaptive slicing splatting
for time-aware reconstruction. Additionally, we employ intensity importance
pruning to eliminate floating artifacts and enhance 3D consistency, while
incorporating an adaptive contrast threshold for more precise optimization. We
design a synthetic multi-view camera setup with six moving event cameras
surrounding the object in a 360-degree configuration and provide a benchmark
multi-view event stream dataset that captures challenging motion scenarios. Our
approach outperforms both event-only and event-RGB fusion baselines and paves
the way for the exploration of multi-view event-based reconstruction as a novel
approach for rapid scene capture.

Abstract: Detection of face forgery videos remains a formidable challenge in the field
of digital forensics, especially the generalization to unseen datasets and
common perturbations. In this paper, we tackle this issue by leveraging the
synergy between audio and visual speech elements, embarking on a novel approach
through audio-visual speech representation learning. Our work is motivated by
the finding that audio signals, enriched with speech content, can provide
precise information effectively reflecting facial movements. To this end, we
first learn precise audio-visual speech representations on real videos via a
self-supervised masked prediction task, which encodes both local and global
semantic information simultaneously. Then, the derived model is directly
transferred to the forgery detection task. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of
cross-dataset generalization and robustness, without the participation of any
fake video in model training. Code is available at

Abstract: Cell detection, segmentation and classification are essential for analyzing
tumor microenvironments (TME) on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides. Existing
methods suffer from poor performance on understudied cell types (rare or not

covering 13 cell types. In external validation across 4 independent cohorts,
HistoPLUS outperforms current state-of-the-art models in detection quality by
5.2% and overall F1 classification score by 23.7%, while using 5x fewer
parameters. Notably, HistoPLUS unlocks the study of 7 understudied cell types
and brings significant improvements on 8 of 13 cell types. Moreover, we show
that HistoPLUS robustly transfers to two oncology indications unseen during
training. To support broader TME biomarker research, we release the model

Conclusion: HTG在低资源HTR中具有潜力，但需进一步改进以优化其应用效果。

Abstract: The digitization of historical manuscripts presents significant challenges
for Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) systems, particularly when dealing with
small, author-specific collections that diverge from the training data
distributions. Handwritten Text Generation (HTG) techniques, which generate
synthetic data tailored to specific handwriting styles, offer a promising
solution to address these challenges. However, the effectiveness of various HTG
models in enhancing HTR performance, especially in low-resource transcription
settings, has not been thoroughly evaluated. In this work, we systematically
compare three state-of-the-art styled HTG models (representing the generative
adversarial, diffusion, and autoregressive paradigms for HTG) to assess their
impact on HTR fine-tuning. We analyze how visual and linguistic characteristics
of synthetic data influence fine-tuning outcomes and provide quantitative
guidelines for selecting the most effective HTG model. The results of our
analysis provide insights into the current capabilities of HTG methods and
highlight key areas for further improvement in their application to
low-resource HTR.

TL;DR: AST-n框架通过从中间噪声水平启动反向扩散并结合高阶ODE求解器，显著加速低剂量CT去噪，同时保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低剂量CT（LDCT）虽减少辐射但增加噪声，影响诊断信心，需高效去噪方法。

Method: 提出AST-n框架，结合高阶ODE求解器，减少采样步骤，评估两种加速范式。

Result: AST-25在25步内实现PSNR>38 dB和SSIM>0.95，推理时间从16秒降至1秒。

Conclusion: AST-n结合高阶求解器在临床中可行，显著提升扩散模型在LDCT去噪中的实用性。

Abstract: Low-dose CT (LDCT) protocols reduce radiation exposure but increase image
noise, compromising diagnostic confidence. Diffusion-based generative models
have shown promise for LDCT denoising by learning image priors and performing
iterative refinement. In this work, we introduce AST-n, an accelerated
inference framework that initiates reverse diffusion from intermediate noise
levels, and integrate high-order ODE solvers within conditioned models to
further reduce sampling steps. We evaluate two acceleration paradigms--AST-n
sampling and standard scheduling with high-order solvers -- on the Low Dose CT
Grand Challenge dataset, covering head, abdominal, and chest scans at 10-25 %
of standard dose. Conditioned models using only 25 steps (AST-25) achieve peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) above 38 dB and structural similarity index (SSIM)
above 0.95, closely matching standard baselines while cutting inference time
from ~16 seg to under 1 seg per slice. Unconditional sampling suffers
substantial quality loss, underscoring the necessity of conditioning. We also
assess DDIM inversion, which yields marginal PSNR gains at the cost of doubling
inference time, limiting its clinical practicality. Our results demonstrate
that AST-n with high-order samplers enables rapid LDCT reconstruction without
significant loss of image fidelity, advancing the feasibility of
diffusion-based methods in clinical workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何简化视觉上下文学习过程，避免复杂训练或额外数据，提高通用性。

Method: 在Stable Diffusion的自注意力层中重新计算注意力，显式结合查询与示例提示的上下文。

Result: 在六种视觉任务中表现优异，例如前景分割任务在Pascal-5i数据集上mIoU提升8.9%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法无需微调即可高效适应多任务，并通过集成进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) in natural language processing (NLP) have
demonstrated great potential for in-context learning (ICL) -- the ability to
leverage a few sets of example prompts to adapt to various tasks without having
to explicitly update the model weights. ICL has recently been explored for
computer vision tasks with promising early outcomes. These approaches involve
specialized training and/or additional data that complicate the process and
limit its generalizability. In this work, we show that off-the-shelf Stable
Diffusion models can be repurposed for visual in-context learning (V-ICL).
Specifically, we formulate an in-place attention re-computation within the
self-attention layers of the Stable Diffusion architecture that explicitly
incorporates context between the query and example prompts. Without any
additional fine-tuning, we show that this repurposed Stable Diffusion model is
able to adapt to six different tasks: foreground segmentation, single object
detection, semantic segmentation, keypoint detection, edge detection, and
colorization. For example, the proposed approach improves the mean intersection
over union (mIoU) for the foreground segmentation task on Pascal-5i dataset by
8.9% and 3.2% over recent methods such as Visual Prompting and IMProv,
respectively. Additionally, we show that the proposed method is able to
effectively leverage multiple prompts through ensembling to infer the task

Conclusion: LIA-X通过可解释和可控的设计，为肖像动画和编辑提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce LIA-X, a novel interpretable portrait animator designed to
transfer facial dynamics from a driving video to a source portrait with
fine-grained control. LIA-X is an autoencoder that models motion transfer as a
linear navigation of motion codes in latent space. Crucially, it incorporates a
novel Sparse Motion Dictionary that enables the model to disentangle facial
dynamics into interpretable factors. Deviating from previous 'warp-render'
approaches, the interpretability of the Sparse Motion Dictionary allows LIA-X
to support a highly controllable 'edit-warp-render' strategy, enabling precise
manipulation of fine-grained facial semantics in the source portrait. This
helps to narrow initial differences with the driving video in terms of pose and
expression. Moreover, we demonstrate the scalability of LIA-X by successfully
training a large-scale model with approximately 1 billion parameters on
extensive datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed method
outperforms previous approaches in both self-reenactment and cross-reenactment
tasks across several benchmarks. Additionally, the interpretable and
controllable nature of LIA-X supports practical applications such as
fine-grained, user-guided image and video editing, as well as 3D-aware portrait
video manipulation.

Abstract: Progress in AI for automated nutritional analysis is critically hampered by
the lack of standardized evaluation methodologies and high-quality, real-world
benchmark datasets. To address this, we introduce three primary contributions.
First, we present the January Food Benchmark (JFB), a publicly available
collection of 1,000 food images with human-validated annotations. Second, we
detail a comprehensive benchmarking framework, including robust metrics and a
novel, application-oriented overall score designed to assess model performance
holistically. Third, we provide baseline results from both general-purpose
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and our own specialized model,
january/food-vision-v1. Our evaluation demonstrates that the specialized model
achieves an Overall Score of 86.2, a 12.1-point improvement over the
best-performing general-purpose configuration. This work offers the research
community a valuable new evaluation dataset and a rigorous framework to guide
and benchmark future developments in automated nutritional analysis.

*Tianqi Xiang,Yi Li,Qixiang Zhang,Xiaomeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种元优化分类器（MOC），通过元学习器和分类器库的组合，显著提升了少样本学习在病理图像分类中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的少样本学习方法在病理图像分类中仍受限于数据稀缺问题，需要更高效的分类器设计。

Method: MOC包含一个元学习器和一个分类器库，前者优化分类器配置，后者提供多样化的候选分类器。

Result: 在多个少样本基准测试中，MOC表现优于现有方法，尤其在TCGA-NSCLC基准上AUC提升了10.4%。

Conclusion: MOC为临床部署中数据稀缺问题提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了少样本学习的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in histopathology vision-language foundation models (VLFMs)
have shown promise in addressing data scarcity for whole slide image (WSI)
classification via zero-shot adaptation. However, these methods remain
outperformed by conventional multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches
trained on large datasets, motivating recent efforts to enhance VLFM-based WSI
classification through fewshot learning paradigms. While existing few-shot
methods improve diagnostic accuracy with limited annotations, their reliance on
conventional classifier designs introduces critical vulnerabilities to data
scarcity. To address this problem, we propose a Meta-Optimized Classifier (MOC)
comprising two core components: (1) a meta-learner that automatically optimizes
a classifier configuration from a mixture of candidate classifiers and (2) a
classifier bank housing diverse candidate classifiers to enable a holistic
pathological interpretation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOC
outperforms prior arts in multiple few-shot benchmarks. Notably, on the
TCGA-NSCLC benchmark, MOC improves AUC by 10.4% over the state-of-the-art
few-shot VLFM-based methods, with gains up to 26.25% under 1-shot conditions,
offering a critical advancement for clinical deployments where diagnostic
training data is severely limited. Code is available at

*Geonhee Sim,Gyeongsik Moon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PERSONA框架结合3D和扩散方法，从单张图像生成个性化3D人体化身，解决身份保持和姿态驱动变形问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D方法需要大量姿态丰富的视频，扩散方法难以保持身份一致性，PERSONA旨在结合两者优势。

Method: 利用扩散模型从单张图像生成姿态丰富的视频，再优化3D化身，引入平衡采样和几何加权优化。

Result: 实现了从单张图像生成高质量、身份一致的3D化身，支持多样姿态驱动变形。

Conclusion: PERSONA为单图像个性化3D化身提供高效解决方案，平衡了身份保持和姿态变形需求。

Abstract: Two major approaches exist for creating animatable human avatars. The first,
a 3D-based approach, optimizes a NeRF- or 3DGS-based avatar from videos of a
single person, achieving personalization through a disentangled identity
representation. However, modeling pose-driven deformations, such as non-rigid
cloth deformations, requires numerous pose-rich videos, which are costly and
impractical to capture in daily life. The second, a diffusion-based approach,
learns pose-driven deformations from large-scale in-the-wild videos but
struggles with identity preservation and pose-dependent identity entanglement.
We present PERSONA, a framework that combines the strengths of both approaches
to obtain a personalized 3D human avatar with pose-driven deformations from a
single image. PERSONA leverages a diffusion-based approach to generate
pose-rich videos from the input image and optimizes a 3D avatar based on them.
To ensure high authenticity and sharp renderings across diverse poses, we
introduce balanced sampling and geometry-weighted optimization. Balanced
sampling oversamples the input image to mitigate identity shifts in
diffusion-generated training videos. Geometry-weighted optimization prioritizes
geometry constraints over image loss, preserving rendering quality in diverse
poses.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a powerful alternative
to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for 3D scene representation, offering
high-fidelity photorealistic rendering with real-time performance. Beyond novel
view synthesis, the explicit and compact nature of 3DGS enables a wide range of
downstream applications that require geometric and semantic understanding. This
survey provides a comprehensive overview of recent progress in 3DGS
applications. It first introduces 2D foundation models that support semantic
understanding and control in 3DGS applications, followed by a review of
NeRF-based methods that inform their 3DGS counterparts. We then categorize 3DGS
applications into segmentation, editing, generation, and other functional
tasks. For each, we summarize representative methods, supervision strategies,
and learning paradigms, highlighting shared design principles and emerging
trends. Commonly used datasets and evaluation protocols are also summarized,
along with comparative analyses of recent methods across public benchmarks. To
support ongoing research and development, a continually updated repository of
papers, code, and resources is maintained at

TL;DR: LLMC+是一个全面的VLM压缩基准测试工具包，解决了现有方法在空间和时间冗余、多任务评估及联合压缩技术方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（VLMs）因计算和内存需求高而难以应用，现有压缩方法存在模块不可比、评估局限和孤立使用技术的问题。

Method: 提出LLMC+，支持20多种算法和五种VLM家族，系统研究令牌级和模型级压缩。

Result: 发现空间和时间冗余需不同策略，令牌减少方法在多轮对话中表现差，联合压缩可实现高效压缩。

Conclusion: LLMC+有助于公平评估和推动高效VLM研究。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit impressive multi-modal
capabilities but suffer from prohibitive computational and memory demands, due
to their long visual token sequences and massive parameter sizes. To address
these issues, recent works have proposed training-free compression methods.
However, existing efforts often suffer from three major limitations: (1)
Current approaches do not decompose techniques into comparable modules,
hindering fair evaluation across spatial and temporal redundancy. (2)
Evaluation confined to simple single-turn tasks, failing to reflect performance
in realistic scenarios. (3) Isolated use of individual compression techniques,
without exploring their joint potential. To overcome these gaps, we introduce
LLMC+, a comprehensive VLM compression benchmark with a versatile,
plug-and-play toolkit. LLMC+ supports over 20 algorithms across five
representative VLM families and enables systematic study of token-level and
model-level compression. Our benchmark reveals that: (1) Spatial and temporal
redundancies demand distinct technical strategies. (2) Token reduction methods
degrade significantly in multi-turn dialogue and detail-sensitive tasks. (3)
Combining token and model compression achieves extreme compression with minimal
performance loss. We believe LLMC+ will facilitate fair evaluation and inspire
future research in efficient VLM. Our code is available at

*David Dinkevich,Matan Levy,Omri Avrahami,Dvir Samuel,Dani Lischinski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Story2Board是一个无需训练的框架，用于从自然语言生成富有表现力的故事板。它通过轻量级一致性框架解决现有方法忽略的视觉叙事关键方面，如空间构图和背景演变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过于关注主体身份，忽略了视觉叙事中的空间构图、背景演变和叙事节奏等关键方面。

Method: 引入轻量级一致性框架，包括潜在面板锚定（保持角色一致性）和互惠注意力值混合（软融合视觉特征）。使用现成语言模型将故事转换为面板级提示。

Result: 在Rich Storyboard Benchmark上，Story2Board生成的故事板在一致性、布局多样性和叙事吸引力方面优于现有基线。

Conclusion: Story2Board无需架构更改或微调，即可生成动态、连贯且叙事吸引力的故事板。

Abstract: We present Story2Board, a training-free framework for expressive storyboard
generation from natural language. Existing methods narrowly focus on subject
identity, overlooking key aspects of visual storytelling such as spatial
composition, background evolution, and narrative pacing. To address this, we
introduce a lightweight consistency framework composed of two components:
Latent Panel Anchoring, which preserves a shared character reference across
panels, and Reciprocal Attention Value Mixing, which softly blends visual
features between token pairs with strong reciprocal attention. Together, these
mechanisms enhance coherence without architectural changes or fine-tuning,
enabling state-of-the-art diffusion models to generate visually diverse yet
consistent storyboards. To structure generation, we use an off-the-shelf
language model to convert free-form stories into grounded panel-level prompts.
To evaluate, we propose the Rich Storyboard Benchmark, a suite of open-domain
narratives designed to assess layout diversity and background-grounded
storytelling, in addition to consistency. We also introduce a new Scene
Diversity metric that quantifies spatial and pose variation across storyboards.
Our qualitative and quantitative results, as well as a user study, show that
Story2Board produces more dynamic, coherent, and narratively engaging
storyboards than existing baselines.
