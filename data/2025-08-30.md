### [1] [Social Bias in Multilingual Language Models: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20201)
*Lance Calvin Lim Gamboa,Yue Feng,Mark Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文对多语言预训练模型中的社会偏见研究进行了系统性综述，分析了偏见评估和缓解方法在多语言和非英语语境中的应用现状、存在的问题及未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练多语言模型存在与英语模型类似的社会偏见问题，但当前研究主要关注英语语境，缺乏对多语言和文化多样性背景下的偏见系统性分析。

Method: 采用系统性文献综述方法，从语言多样性、文化意识、评估指标和缓解技术选择等维度分析现有研究，识别领域中的方法论缺陷和常见问题。

Result: 发现当前研究存在语言偏好性（偏向某些语言）、多语言缓解实验稀缺等问题，同时整理了跨语言和文化适应偏见基准的常见问题和解决方案。

Conclusion: 提出了未来研究方向，旨在增强多语言偏见研究的包容性、跨文化适当性以及与最先进NLP进展的一致性。

Abstract: Pretrained multilingual models exhibit the same social bias as models
processing English texts. This systematic review analyzes emerging research
that extends bias evaluation and mitigation approaches into multilingual and
non-English contexts. We examine these studies with respect to linguistic
diversity, cultural awareness, and their choice of evaluation metrics and
mitigation techniques. Our survey illuminates gaps in the field's dominant
methodological design choices (e.g., preference for certain languages, scarcity
of multilingual mitigation experiments) while cataloging common issues
encountered and solutions implemented in adapting bias benchmarks across
languages and cultures. Drawing from the implications of our findings, we chart
directions for future research that can reinforce the multilingual bias
literature's inclusivity, cross-cultural appropriateness, and alignment with
state-of-the-art NLP advancements.

### [2] [Prompting Strategies for Language Model-Based Item Generation in K-12 Education: Bridging the Gap Between Small and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20217)
*Mohammad Amini,Babak Ahmadi,Xiaomeng Xiong,Yilin Zhang,Christopher Qiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这研究探索了使用语言模型自动生成多选题进行形态评估的方法，通过结构化提示策略和精细调整提升中等规模模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低手动开发测试的成本和不一致性，寻找一种实用可扩展的方法来开发和验证K-12语言评估项目。

Method: 采用两种方法：比较精细调整的中等模型(Gemma, 2B)与未调整的大模型(GPT-3.5, 175B)；评估七种结构化提示策略，包括零样本、少样本、思维链、角色基础、序列化等。使用自动指标和专家评分进行评估，并用GPT-4.1模拟大规模人工评分。

Result: 结构化提示特别是思维链与序列设计组合显著提升了Gemma的输出质量。Gemma通常比GPT-3.5的零样本响应产生更结构对齐和教学适宜的题目，提示设计对中等规模模型的性能至关重要。

Conclusion: 结构化提示和高效精细调整可以在有限数据条件下提升中等模型的自动生成能力。结合自动指标、专家判断和大模型模拟的方法能确保与评估目标的对齐，为K-12语言评估项目开发提供了实用可扩展的工作流程。

Abstract: This study explores automatic generation (AIG) using language models to
create multiple choice questions (MCQs) for morphological assessment, aiming to
reduce the cost and inconsistency of manual test development. The study used a
two-fold approach. First, we compared a fine-tuned medium model (Gemma, 2B)
with a larger untuned one (GPT-3.5, 175B). Second, we evaluated seven
structured prompting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot,
chain-of-thought, role-based, sequential, and combinations. Generated items
were assessed using automated metrics and expert scoring across five
dimensions. We also used GPT-4.1, trained on expert-rated samples, to simulate
human scoring at scale. Results show that structured prompting, especially
strategies combining chain-of-thought and sequential design, significantly
improved Gemma's outputs. Gemma generally produced more construct-aligned and
instructionally appropriate items than GPT-3.5's zero-shot responses, with
prompt design playing a key role in mid-size model performance. This study
demonstrates that structured prompting and efficient fine-tuning can enhance
midsized models for AIG under limited data conditions. We highlight the value
of combining automated metrics, expert judgment, and large-model simulation to
ensure alignment with assessment goals. The proposed workflow offers a
practical and scalable way to develop and validate language assessment items
for K-12.

### [3] [Integrating SystemC TLM into FMI 3.0 Co-Simulations with an Open-Source Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20223)
*Andrei Mihai Albu,Giovanni Pollo,Alessio Burrello,Daniele Jahier Pagliari,Cristian Tesconi,Alessandra Neri,Dario Soldi,Fabio Autieri,Sara Vinco*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种将SystemC TLM模型集成到FMI协同仿真工作流程的开源方法，通过将SystemC组件封装为FMI 3.0 FMU实现跨域集成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着信息物理系统复杂度的增加，特别是汽车应用中，需要高效的建模和跨域协同仿真技术。SystemC TLM虽然支持硬件/软件协同设计，但与其他工程领域模型的互操作性有限。

Method: 开发了完全开源的方法论，将SystemC TLM组件封装为FMI 3.0协同仿真功能模型单元(FMUs)，提供轻量级开源工具链，解决时间同步和数据交换等关键技术挑战。

Result: 通过代表性案例研究证明了集成的可行性和有效性，实现了异构仿真环境间的无缝标准化集成。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了SystemC TLM与其他工程领域模型的集成挑战，为跨域协同仿真提供了有效的开源解决方案。

Abstract: The growing complexity of cyber-physical systems, particularly in automotive
applications, has increased the demand for efficient modeling and cross-domain
co-simulation techniques. While SystemC Transaction-Level Modeling (TLM)
enables effective hardware/software co-design, its limited interoperability
with models from other engineering domains poses integration challenges. This
paper presents a fully open-source methodology for integrating SystemC TLM
models into Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI)-based co-simulation workflows.
By encapsulating SystemC TLM components as FMI 3.0 Co Simulation Functional
Mock-up Units (FMUs), the proposed approach facilitates seamless, standardized
integration across heterogeneous simulation environments. We introduce a
lightweight open-source toolchain, address key technical challenges such as
time synchronization and data exchange, and demonstrate the feasibility and
effectiveness of the integration through representative case studies.

### [4] [Can Compact Language Models Search Like Agents? Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization for Preserving Agentic RAG Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20324)
*Rikuto Kotoge,Mai Nishimura,Jiaxin Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DGPO通过教师演示的冷启动初始化和持续教师指导，解决了紧凑语言模型在强化学习训练中的稀疏奖励和不稳定问题，使小模型能够实现复杂的代理搜索行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 紧凑语言模型（如0.5B参数）由于推理能力差，在强化学习训练中面临稀疏奖励和不稳定问题，难以实现代理RAG行为。

Method: 提出蒸馏引导策略优化（DGPO），包括从教师演示的冷启动初始化和策略优化过程中的持续教师指导。

Result: DGPO使紧凑模型能够实现复杂的代理搜索行为，在某些情况下甚至优于更大的教师模型。

Conclusion: DGPO使得在计算资源受限的环境中实现代理RAG成为可能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a post-training approach to elicit
agentic RAG behaviors such as search and planning from language models.
However, compact language models (e.g., 0.5B parameters) struggle due to poor
reasoning ability, resulting in sparse rewards and unstable training. To
overcome these difficulties, we propose Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization
(DGPO), which addresses the challenges through cold-start initialization from
teacher demonstrations and continuous teacher guidance during policy
optimization. To systematically evaluate our approach, we introduce Agentic RAG
Capabilities (ARC), a fine-grained metric analyzing reasoning, search
coordination, and response synthesis. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that DGPO enables compact models to achieve sophisticated agentic search
behaviors, even outperforming the larger teacher model in some cases. DGPO
makes agentic RAG feasible in computing resource-constrained environments.

### [5] [GUARD: Guideline Upholding Test through Adaptive Role-play and Jailbreak Diagnostics for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20325)
*Haibo Jin,Ruoxi Chen,Peiyan Zhang,Andy Zhou,Yang Zhang,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GUARD是一个基于政府伦理指南的LLM测试框架，通过自动化生成违规问题和越狱诊断来评估语言模型对安全准则的遵守程度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在各领域的广泛应用，其可能生成有害内容的问题引发了社会关注。政府发布的伦理指南多为高层次要求，缺乏具体的可操作测试方法，需要将指南转化为可执行的测试问题

Method: GUARD方法包括：1) 基于政府指南自动生成违规测试问题；2) 对于不直接违规的响应，引入越狱诊断(GUARD-JD)创建场景来激发不道德响应；3) 生成合规报告，详细说明遵守程度和违规情况

Result: 在7个LLM模型(Vicuna-13B、LongChat-7B、Llama2-7B、Llama-3-8B、GPT-3.5、GPT-4、GPT-4o、Claude-3.7)上进行了实证验证，测试了三个政府指南的合规性并进行了越狱诊断。GUARD-JD还可迁移到视觉语言模型

Conclusion: GUARD提供了一种系统化的方法来将高层伦理指南转化为具体的测试问题，有效识别LLM的安全漏洞和合规问题，有助于促进可靠的LLM应用开发

Abstract: As Large Language Models become increasingly integral to various domains,
their potential to generate harmful responses has prompted significant societal
and regulatory concerns. In response, governments have issued ethics guidelines
to promote the development of trustworthy AI. However, these guidelines are
typically high-level demands for developers and testers, leaving a gap in
translating them into actionable testing questions to verify LLM compliance.
  To address this challenge, we introduce GUARD (\textbf{G}uideline
\textbf{U}pholding Test through \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}ole-play and
Jailbreak \textbf{D}iagnostics), a testing method designed to operationalize
guidelines into specific guideline-violating questions that assess LLM
adherence. To implement this, GUARD uses automated generation of
guideline-violating questions based on government-issued guidelines, thereby
testing whether responses comply with these guidelines. When responses directly
violate guidelines, GUARD reports inconsistencies. Furthermore, for responses
that do not directly violate guidelines, GUARD integrates the concept of
``jailbreaks'' to diagnostics, named GUARD-JD, which creates scenarios that
provoke unethical or guideline-violating responses, effectively identifying
potential scenarios that could bypass built-in safety mechanisms. Our method
finally culminates in a compliance report, delineating the extent of adherence
and highlighting any violations.
  We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on seven LLMs,
including Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, Llama2-7B, Llama-3-8B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4,
GPT-4o, and Claude-3.7, by testing compliance under three government-issued
guidelines and conducting jailbreak diagnostics. Additionally, GUARD-JD can
transfer jailbreak diagnostics to vision-language models, demonstrating its
usage in promoting reliable LLM-based applications.

### [6] [Joint Enhancement of Relational Reasoning for Long-Context LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20351)
*Zhirui Chen,Wei Shen,Jiashui Huang,Ling Shao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: JERR是一个基于图推理的框架，通过摘要提取、图构建和关系推理三个组件，提升大语言模型在长上下文理解方面的能力，在ROUGE和F1指标上优于所有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在处理长上下文时面临内存限制和复杂任务处理困难的问题，同时缺乏透明度且容易产生幻觉输出。

Method: JERR框架包含三个关键组件：1）策略性文本分块进行摘要提取；2）构建有向无环图（DAG）解决冗余问题；3）集成蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）进行复杂推理路径导航。

Result: 实验结果表明JERR在ROUGE和F1指标上 consistently优于所有基线方法，在LLM-Rater评估中获得最高分数。

Conclusion: JERR为大语言模型处理扩展上下文和复杂推理任务提供了新颖的解决方案，显著提高了可靠性和透明度。

Abstract: Despite significant progress, large language models (LLMs) still struggle
with long contexts due to memory limitations and their inability to tackle
complex and long-context tasks. Additionally, LLMs often suffer from a lack of
transparency and are prone to producing hallucinations. To address these
challenges, we propose \textbf{JERR}, a novel framework designed to enhance
long-context comprehension via graph-based reasoning in LLMs. JERR integrates
three key components: synopsis extraction, graph construction, and relational
reasoning. First, synopsis is extracted by chunking text strategically,
allowing the model to summarize and understand information more efficiently.
Second, we build a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to resolve redundancy, ensuring
logical consistency and clarity. Finally, we incorporate Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to help the model navigate complex reasoning paths, ensuring more
accurate and interpretable outputs. This framework provides a novel solution
that enables LLMs to handle extended contexts and complex reasoning tasks with
improved reliability and transparency. Experimental results show that JERR
consistently outperforms all baselines on the ROUGE and F1 metrics, achieving
the highest scores on the LLM-Rater evaluation.

### [7] [Graph-R1: Unleashing LLM Reasoning with NP-Hard Graph Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20373)
*Yuyao Wang,Bowen Liu,Jianheng Tang,Nuo Chen,Yuhan Li,Qifan Zhang,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过NP难图论问题构建合成训练数据集，使用两阶段后训练框架提升LLM的长链式思维推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决依赖人工精准标注数据集的成本问题，寻找可扩展的长链式思维训练方案

Method: 使用NP难图论问题作为合成训练资源，采用两阶段后训练：拒绝采样的直接调优和细粒度奖励设计的强化学习

Result: Graph-R1-7B模型在数学、编程、STEM和逻辑任务上展现出强大的沿射能力，在NP难图论问题上准确性和推理效率都超过QwQ-32B

Conclusion: NP难图论问题是一种高效且可扩展的资源，为LLM的长链式思维推理进阶开启了新方向

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress on complex reasoning tasks, largely enabled by their long
chain-of-thought (Long CoT) capabilities. However, developing these Long CoT
behaviors relies heavily on post-training with high-quality datasets, which are
typically costly and human-curated (e.g., mathematics and code), leaving
scalable alternatives unexplored. In this work, we introduce NP-hard (NPH)
graph problems as a novel synthetic training corpus, as they inherently require
deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and reflective strategies, which are
core characteristics of Long CoT reasoning. Building on this insight, we
develop a two-stage post-training framework: (i) Long CoT Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on rejection-sampled NPH graph instances, which substantially
enhances reasoning depth, and (ii) Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a
fine-grained reward design, which sharpens reasoning efficiency. Our flagship
model, Graph-R1-7B, demonstrates strong generalization across mathematics,
coding, STEM, and logic, and surpasses QwQ-32B on NPH graph problems in both
accuracy and reasoning efficiency. These results position NPH graph problems as
an effective and scalable resource for advancing Long CoT reasoning in LLMs,
opening a new frontier for LLM post-training. Our implementation is available
at https://github.com/Graph-Reasoner/Graph-R1, with models and datasets hosted
in our Hugging Face collection HKUST-DSAIL/Graph-R1.

### [8] [CAPE: Context-Aware Personality Evaluation Framework for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20385)
*Jivnesh Sandhan,Fei Cheng,Tushar Sandhan,Yugo Murawaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个上下文感知的人格评估框架CAPE，通过引入对话历史来评估LLMs的行为特质，发现上下文能增强响应一致性但也会导致人格偏移，不同模型对上下文敏感度不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心理测量测试对LLMs采用无上下文方法，忽略了真实对话中历史交互对响应的影响，需要开发更贴近实际应用的评估框架。

Method: 提出CAPE框架，引入对话历史上下文，设计新指标量化LLM响应一致性，在7个LLMs上进行实验分析，包括GPT系列、Gemini和Llama模型。

Result: 对话历史通过上下文学习增强响应一致性，但会导致人格偏移；GPT模型对问题顺序稳健，而Gemini和Llama对上下文敏感；角色扮演代理中上下文依赖的人格偏移能提高一致性并与人类判断更好对齐。

Conclusion: 上下文感知评估揭示了LLMs行为特质的重要方面，不同模型对上下文的依赖程度不同，上下文能改善响应一致性但需注意可能的人格偏移效应。

Abstract: Psychometric tests, traditionally used to assess humans, are now being
applied to Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate their behavioral traits.
However, existing studies follow a context-free approach, answering each
question in isolation to avoid contextual influence. We term this the Disney
World test, an artificial setting that ignores real-world applications, where
conversational history shapes responses. To bridge this gap, we propose the
first Context-Aware Personality Evaluation (CAPE) framework for LLMs,
incorporating prior conversational interactions. To thoroughly analyze the
influence of context, we introduce novel metrics to quantify the consistency of
LLM responses, a fundamental trait in human behavior.
  Our exhaustive experiments on 7 LLMs reveal that conversational history
enhances response consistency via in-context learning but also induces
personality shifts, with GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-Turbo exhibiting extreme
deviations. While GPT models are robust to question ordering, Gemini-1.5-Flash
and Llama-8B display significant sensitivity. Moreover, GPT models response
stem from their intrinsic personality traits as well as prior interactions,
whereas Gemini-1.5-Flash and Llama--8B heavily depend on prior interactions.
Finally, applying our framework to Role Playing Agents (RPAs) shows
context-dependent personality shifts improve response consistency and better
align with human judgments. Our code and datasets are publicly available at:

### [9] [Measuring Reasoning Utility in LLMs via Conditional Entropy Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20395)
*Xu Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现推理步骤中的条件熵变化模式与答案正确性相关：熵递减对应正确答案，熵平坦或递增对应错误答案。错误推理路径往往更长，说明更长推理不一定更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究很少探讨推理步骤对最终答案正确性的实际贡献。由于自回归生成的随机性，生成更多上下文不能保证提高答案置信度，需要预测推理步骤的有效性来优化推理流程。

Method: 在MATH数据集上进行oracle研究，使用Qwen2.5-32B和GPT-4o生成推理链，然后用Qwen3-8B量化推理链对最终准确性的效用。通过条件熵（词汇表上的期望负对数似然）测量模型在每个推理步骤中对答案跨度Y的不确定性。

Result: 发现清晰模式：条件熵随步骤递减与正确答案强相关，而平坦或递增的熵往往导致错误答案。错误推理路径通常比正确路径更长，表明更长推理不一定产生更好结果。

Conclusion: 这些发现为设计高效推理流程提供了基础，可以早期检测和避免无效推理，从而优化大语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) often rely on generating
intermediate reasoning steps to enhance accuracy. However, little work has
examined how reasoning utility contributes to the final answer's correctness.
Due to the stochastic nature of autoregressive generation, generating more
context does not guarantee increased confidence in the answer. If we could
predict, during generation, whether a reasoning step will be useful, we could
stop early or prune ineffective steps, avoiding distractions in the final
decision.
  We present an oracle study on MATH dataset, using Qwen2.5-32B and GPT-4o to
generate reasoning chains, and then employing a separate model (Qwen3-8B) to
quantify the utility of these chains for final accuracy. Specifically, we
measure the model's uncertainty on the answer span Y at each reasoning step
using conditional entropy (expected negative log-likelihood over the
vocabulary) with context expanding step by step. Our results show a clear
pattern: conditional entropy that decreases over steps is strongly associated
with correct answers, whereas flat or increasing entropy often results in wrong
answers. We also corroborate that incorrect reasoning paths tend to be longer
than correct ones, suggesting that longer reasoning does not necessarily yield
better outcomes. These findings serve as a foundation to inspire future work on
designing efficient reasoning pipelines that detect and avoid unproductive
reasoning early.

### [11] [DentalBench: Benchmarking and Advancing LLMs Capability for Bilingual Dentistry Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20416)
*Hengchuan Zhu,Yihuan Xu,Yichen Li,Zijie Meng,Zuozhu Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DentalBench是首个针对牙科领域的双语基准测试，包含问答数据集和语料库，评估显示现有LLM在牙科专业领域存在显著性能差距，领域适应能大幅提升模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在通用医疗基准上表现良好，但在需要深度专业知识的牙科等专科领域缺乏针对性评估资源，能力尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 构建DentalBench基准：包含36,597个中英文问题的DentalQA问答数据集（4任务16子领域）和3.37亿token的DentalCorpus语料库。评估14个LLM并进行领域适应实验。

Result: 评估显示不同模型在任务类型和语言上存在显著性能差距。使用Qwen-2.5-3B的实验表明领域适应大幅提升模型性能，特别是在知识密集和术语密集型任务上。

Conclusion: 领域特定基准测试对于开发可信赖且有效的医疗应用LLM至关重要，DentalBench填补了牙科领域评估资源的空白。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and medical LLMs (Med-LLMs)
have demonstrated strong performance on general medical benchmarks. However,
their capabilities in specialized medical fields, such as dentistry which
require deeper domain-specific knowledge, remain underexplored due to the lack
of targeted evaluation resources. In this paper, we introduce DentalBench, the
first comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to evaluate and advance LLMs
in the dental domain. DentalBench consists of two main components: DentalQA, an
English-Chinese question-answering (QA) benchmark with 36,597 questions
spanning 4 tasks and 16 dental subfields; and DentalCorpus, a large-scale,
high-quality corpus with 337.35 million tokens curated for dental domain
adaptation, supporting both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We evaluate 14 LLMs, covering
proprietary, open-source, and medical-specific models, and reveal significant
performance gaps across task types and languages. Further experiments with
Qwen-2.5-3B demonstrate that domain adaptation substantially improves model
performance, particularly on knowledge-intensive and terminology-focused tasks,
and highlight the importance of domain-specific benchmarks for developing
trustworthy and effective LLMs tailored to healthcare applications.

### [12] [KG-CQR: Leveraging Structured Relation Representations in Knowledge Graphs for Contextual Query Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20417)
*Chi Minh Bui,Ngoc Mai Thieu,Van Vinh Nguyen,Json J. Jung,Khac-Hoai Nam Bui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KG-CQR是一个基于知识图谱的上下文查询检索框架，通过提取和补全相关KG子图来丰富查询上下文，在RAG系统中显著提升检索性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要解决语料库级别的上下文丢失问题，但缺乏对复杂查询的结构化关系表示和语义丰富化处理

Method: 包含子图提取、补全和上下文生成三个模块的模型无关流水线，通过知识图谱增强查询的上下文表示

Result: 在RAGBench和MultiHop-RAG数据集上实现mAP提升4-6%，Recall@25提升2-3%，在多跳问答任务中持续优于基线模型

Conclusion: KG-CQR通过知识图谱的集成有效提升了RAG系统的检索效果，具有模型无关性和良好的可扩展性

Abstract: The integration of knowledge graphs (KGs) with large language models (LLMs)
offers significant potential to improve the retrieval phase of
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. In this study, we propose KG-CQR,
a novel framework for Contextual Query Retrieval (CQR) that enhances the
retrieval phase by enriching the contextual representation of complex input
queries using a corpus-centric KG. Unlike existing methods that primarily
address corpus-level context loss, KG-CQR focuses on query enrichment through
structured relation representations, extracting and completing relevant KG
subgraphs to generate semantically rich query contexts. Comprising subgraph
extraction, completion, and contextual generation modules, KG-CQR operates as a
model-agnostic pipeline, ensuring scalability across LLMs of varying sizes
without additional training. Experimental results on RAGBench and MultiHop-RAG
datasets demonstrate KG-CQR's superior performance, achieving a 4-6%
improvement in mAP and a 2-3% improvement in Recall@25 over strong baseline
models. Furthermore, evaluations on challenging RAG tasks such as multi-hop
question answering show that, by incorporating KG-CQR, the performance
consistently outperforms the existing baseline in terms of retrieval
effectiveness

### [13] [CAMB: A comprehensive industrial LLM benchmark on civil aviation maintenance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20420)
*Feng Zhang,Chengjie Pang,Yuehan Zhang,Chenyu Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个专门为民航维修领域设计的工业级基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在该垂直领域的知识掌握和复杂推理能力，填补了当前LLM评估主要关注数学和编程推理任务的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 民航维修领域缺乏专门的大语言模型评估工具，该领域具有严格的行业标准和知识密集型特点，需要复杂的推理能力。当前LLM评估主要关注数学和编程任务，无法有效评估专业领域能力。

Method: 开发了一个工业级的民航维修基准测试，用于标准化评估LLM在该领域的能力。同时利用该基准测试评估现有的向量嵌入模型和LLM在民航维修场景中的表现。

Result: 通过实验探索和分析，证明了该基准测试在评估模型性能方面的有效性。开源了评估基准和代码以促进进一步研究。

Conclusion: 该基准测试为民航维修领域的LLM评估提供了标准化工具，能够识别领域知识和复杂推理方面的具体差距，为针对性改进（如领域特定微调、RAG优化等）奠定基础，推动民航维修智能化解决方案的发展。

Abstract: Civil aviation maintenance is a domain characterized by stringent industry
standards. Within this field, maintenance procedures and troubleshooting
represent critical, knowledge-intensive tasks that require sophisticated
reasoning. To address the lack of specialized evaluation tools for large
language models (LLMs) in this vertical, we propose and develop an
industrial-grade benchmark specifically designed for civil aviation
maintenance. This benchmark serves a dual purpose: It provides a standardized
tool to measure LLM capabilities within civil aviation maintenance, identifying
specific gaps in domain knowledge and complex reasoning. By pinpointing these
deficiencies, the benchmark establishes a foundation for targeted improvement
efforts (e.g., domain-specific fine-tuning, RAG optimization, or specialized
prompt engineering), ultimately facilitating progress toward more intelligent
solutions within civil aviation maintenance. Our work addresses a significant
gap in the current LLM evaluation, which primarily focuses on mathematical and
coding reasoning tasks. In addition, given that Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems are currently the dominant solutions in practical applications ,
we leverage this benchmark to evaluate existing well-known vector embedding
models and LLMs for civil aviation maintenance scenarios. Through experimental
exploration and analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark in
assessing model performance within this domain, and we open-source this
evaluation benchmark and code to foster further research and
development:https://github.com/CamBenchmark/cambenchmark

Result: 在705个实践工作标题的测试中，系统在两个测试阶段都成功找到了相同数量的匹配标题，并在第二阶段获得了更高的平均匹配分数

Conclusion: 该系统能够有效搜索实践工作标题，TF-IDF和余弦相似度的结合在案例检索中表现良好，为基于经验的案例搜索提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Case Base Reasoning (CBR) is a case solving technique based on experience in
cases that have occurred before with the highest similarity. CBR is used to
search for practical work titles. TF-IDF is applied to process the
vectorization of each practical work title word and Cosine Similarity for the
calculation of similarity values. This system can search either in the form of
titles or keywords. The output of the system is the title of practical work and
the match value of each title. Based on the test results using 705 practical
work titles, testing was carried out with five titles and carried out in two
stages. The first stage searches with existing titles and the second stage
randomizes the title from the first stage. And the results obtained in the
second stage are the same number of titles found and the highest average match
score.

TL;DR: MCP-Bench是一个基于Model Context Protocol的基准测试，用于评估LLM在多步骤工具使用、跨工具协调和复杂任务规划方面的能力，包含28个真实MCP服务器和250个工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的API基准测试主要依赖显式工具规范、浅层工作流程和孤立领域操作，无法充分评估LLM在模糊指令下的工具检索、多跳执行轨迹规划、跨域工作流协调等关键能力。

Method: 基于MCP协议构建基准，连接28个真实MCP服务器，涵盖金融、旅行、科学计算、学术搜索等领域，设计多步骤任务测试工具模式理解、执行轨迹规划和任务完成能力。

Result: 对20个先进LLM的实验显示，在MCP-Bench上存在持续挑战，表明当前模型在多步骤工具使用和跨域协调方面仍有不足。

Conclusion: MCP-Bench提供了一个更真实的评估框架，揭示了LLM在复杂工具使用场景中的局限性，为未来模型开发提供了重要基准。

Abstract: We introduce MCP-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models
(LLMs) on realistic, multi-step tasks that demand tool use, cross-tool
coordination, precise parameter control, and planning/reasoning for solving
tasks. Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), MCP-Bench connects LLMs to 28
representative live MCP servers spanning 250 tools across domains such as
finance, traveling, scientific computing, and academic search. Unlike prior
API-based benchmarks, each MCP server provides a set of complementary tools
designed to work together, enabling the construction of authentic, multi-step
tasks with rich input-output coupling. Tasks in MCP-Bench test agents' ability
to retrieve relevant tools from fuzzy instructions without explicit tool names,
plan multi-hop execution trajectories for complex objectives, ground responses
in intermediate tool outputs, and orchestrate cross-domain workflows -
capabilities not adequately evaluated by existing benchmarks that rely on
explicit tool specifications, shallow few-step workflows, and isolated domain
operations. We propose a multi-faceted evaluation framework covering tool-level
schema understanding and usage, trajectory-level planning, and task completion.
Experiments on 20 advanced LLMs reveal persistent challenges in MCP-Bench. Code

*Yucheng Ruan,Xiang Lan,Daniel J. Tan,Hairil Rizal Abdullah,Mengling Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一个深度学习框架，整合多模态电子健康记录（结构化数据和自由文本）来预测ICU患者的死亡率和资源利用情况，相比现有方法在多个指标上取得了显著提升，并展现出对数据损坏的强鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注结构化电子健康记录，忽略了自由文本中的宝贵临床信息，且未充分利用结构化数据中的文本信息潜力。需要开发能够整合多模态数据的预测模型来优化ICU患者预后和成本管理。

Method: 使用两个真实世界EHR数据集，开发了基于自然语言处理技术的深度学习框架，包含医疗提示、自由文本和预训练句子编码器三个关键组件。通过消融实验验证各组件重要性，并测试模型对结构化数据损坏的鲁棒性。

Result: 在三个临床任务上，模型性能显著提升：死亡率预测BACC/AUROC提高1.6%/0.8%，住院时间预测RMSE/MAE改善0.5%/2.2%，手术时长估计RMSE/MAE提升10.9%/11.0%。在不同损坏率下均表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架是预测重症监护死亡率和资源利用的有效准确方法，成功展示了使用提示学习和Transformer编码器分析多模态EHR的潜力，特别在高损坏水平下展现出强大的数据损坏抵抗力。

Abstract: Background Predicting mortality and resource utilization from electronic
health records (EHRs) is challenging yet crucial for optimizing patient
outcomes and managing costs in intensive care unit (ICU). Existing approaches
predominantly focus on structured EHRs, often ignoring the valuable clinical
insights in free-text notes. Additionally, the potential of textual information
within structured data is not fully leveraged. This study aimed to introduce
and assess a deep learning framework using natural language processing
techniques that integrates multimodal EHRs to predict mortality and resource
utilization in critical care settings. Methods Utilizing two real-world EHR
datasets, we developed and evaluated our model on three clinical tasks with
leading existing methods. We also performed an ablation study on three key
components in our framework: medical prompts, free-texts, and pre-trained
sentence encoder. Furthermore, we assessed the model's robustness against the
corruption in structured EHRs. Results Our experiments on two real-world
datasets across three clinical tasks showed that our proposed model improved
performance metrics by 1.6\%/0.8\% on BACC/AUROC for mortality prediction,
0.5%/2.2% on RMSE/MAE for LOS prediction, 10.9%/11.0% on RMSE/MAE for surgical
duration estimation compared to the best existing methods. It consistently
demonstrated superior performance compared to other baselines across three
tasks at different corruption rates. Conclusions The proposed framework is an
effective and accurate deep learning approach for predicting mortality and
resource utilization in critical care. The study also highlights the success of
using prompt learning with a transformer encoder in analyzing multimodal EHRs.
Importantly, the model showed strong resilience to data corruption within
structured data, especially at high corruption levels.

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了ConspirED数据集，用于分析阴谋论内容的认知特征，并评估大型语言模型对阴谋论输入的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阴谋论侵蚀公众对科学和机构的信任，且随着AI生成虚假信息的日益复杂化，理解阴谋论内容的修辞模式对于开发干预措施和评估AI漏洞至关重要。

Method: 创建ConspirED数据集，使用CONSPIR认知框架标注在线阴谋论文章的多句摘录，开发计算模型识别阴谋论特征，并评估大型语言/推理模型对阴谋论输入的鲁棒性。

Result: 研究发现大型语言模型和推理模型在面对阴谋论内容时会产生偏差，输出的推理模式会反映输入的阴谋论特征，即使它们能够成功处理类似的事实核查错误信息。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了需要开发更强大的AI系统来抵御阴谋论内容的影响，并为针对性干预措施提供了数据基础。

Abstract: Conspiracy theories erode public trust in science and institutions while
resisting debunking by evolving and absorbing counter-evidence. As AI-generated
misinformation becomes increasingly sophisticated, understanding rhetorical
patterns in conspiratorial content is important for developing interventions
such as targeted prebunking and assessing AI vulnerabilities. We introduce
ConspirED (CONSPIR Evaluation Dataset), which captures the cognitive traits of
conspiratorial ideation in multi-sentence excerpts (80--120 words) from online
conspiracy articles, annotated using the CONSPIR cognitive framework
(Lewandowsky and Cook, 2020). ConspirED is the first dataset of conspiratorial
content annotated for general cognitive traits. Using ConspirED, we (i) develop
computational models that identify conspiratorial traits and determine dominant
traits in text excerpts, and (ii) evaluate large language/reasoning model
(LLM/LRM) robustness to conspiratorial inputs. We find that both are misaligned
by conspiratorial content, producing output that mirrors input reasoning
patterns, even when successfully deflecting comparable fact-checked
misinformation.

TL;DR: FLORES+基准测试在200多种语言的多语言机器翻译评估中存在质量问题，包括翻译质量低于声称标准、领域特异性强、文化偏见明显，以及命名实体复制可获高分等漏洞


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究FLORES+多语言机器翻译基准测试的实际适用性，发现其在真正多语言评估方面存在严重缺陷，需要更准确的评估标准

Method: 通过人工评估四个语言（Asante Twi、日语、Jinghpaw和南阿塞拜疆语）的翻译质量，分析领域特异性和文化偏见，并测试简单启发式方法在基准测试中的表现

Result: 发现许多翻译质量低于90%标准，源句子过于领域特定且偏向英语世界文化，简单命名实体复制就能获得不错的BLEU分数，高质量MT模型在FLORES+上表现差但在领域相关数据上表现好

Conclusion: 呼吁建立使用领域通用和文化中立源文本、减少依赖命名实体的多语言MT基准测试，以更好地反映真实世界的翻译挑战

Abstract: Multilingual machine translation (MT) benchmarks play a central role in
evaluating the capabilities of modern MT systems. Among them, the FLORES+
benchmark is widely used, offering English-to-many translation data for over
200 languages, curated with strict quality control protocols. However, we study
data in four languages (Asante Twi, Japanese, Jinghpaw, and South Azerbaijani)
and uncover critical shortcomings in the benchmark's suitability for truly
multilingual evaluation. Human assessments reveal that many translations fall
below the claimed 90% quality standard, and the annotators report that source
sentences are often too domain-specific and culturally biased toward the
English-speaking world. We further demonstrate that simple heuristics, such as
copying named entities, can yield non-trivial BLEU scores, suggesting
vulnerabilities in the evaluation protocol. Notably, we show that MT models
trained on high-quality, naturalistic data perform poorly on FLORES+ while
achieving significant gains on our domain-relevant evaluation set. Based on
these findings, we advocate for multilingual MT benchmarks that use
domain-general and culturally neutral source texts rely less on named entities,
in order to better reflect real-world translation challenges.

TL;DR: SciTopic是一种基于大语言模型增强的科学文献主题发现方法，通过构建文本编码器、空间优化模块和对比学习微调，显著提升了科学主题识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的主题发现方法主要依赖词嵌入技术，缺乏对科学文献的全面理解，难以处理复杂的高维文本关系。大语言模型在文本理解方面的卓越能力为解决这一问题提供了新的思路。

Method: 1) 构建文本编码器捕获科学文献内容(元数据、标题、摘要)；2) 构建空间优化模块，整合基于熵的采样和LLM指导的三元组任务；3) 基于LLM指导微调文本编码器，通过优化三元组对比损失使编码器更好区分不同主题的实例。

Result: 在三个真实世界科学文献数据集上的广泛实验表明，SciTopic在科学主题发现方面优于最先进的方法，使研究人员能够获得更深入和更快速的洞察。

Conclusion: SciTopic通过利用大语言模型的强大理解能力，有效解决了传统主题发现方法的局限性，为科学文献主题分析提供了更准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Topic discovery in scientific literature provides valuable insights for
researchers to identify emerging trends and explore new avenues for
investigation, facilitating easier scientific information retrieval. Many
machine learning methods, particularly deep embedding techniques, have been
applied to discover research topics. However, most existing topic discovery
methods rely on word embedding to capture the semantics and lack a
comprehensive understanding of scientific publications, struggling with
complex, high-dimensional text relationships. Inspired by the exceptional
comprehension of textual information by large language models (LLMs), we
propose an advanced topic discovery method enhanced by LLMs to improve
scientific topic identification, namely SciTopic. Specifically, we first build
a textual encoder to capture the content from scientific publications,
including metadata, title, and abstract. Next, we construct a space
optimization module that integrates entropy-based sampling and triplet tasks
guided by LLMs, enhancing the focus on thematic relevance and contextual
intricacies between ambiguous instances. Then, we propose to fine-tune the
textual encoder based on the guidance from the LLMs by optimizing the
contrastive loss of the triplets, forcing the text encoder to better
discriminate instances of different topics. Finally, extensive experiments
conducted on three real-world datasets of scientific publications demonstrate
that SciTopic outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) scientific topic
discovery methods, enabling researchers to gain deeper and faster insights.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种适配式联邦蓄粉(AdaFD)框架，以解决多域非IID数据在联邦学习中的挑战，并建立了一个统一的基准测试框架。


<details>

Motivation: 现有联邦蓄粉方法主要关注标签异质性，而忽视了语言域的多样性输入挑战，这在NLP任务中很重要。需要更全面地模拟实际环境中的多域非IID场景。

Method: 提出Adaptive Federated Distillation (AdaFD)框架，设计了统一的基准测试框架包含多样化数据，能够在同构和异构设置下处理多域非IID挑战。

Result: 实验结果显示，该模型能够抓住本地客户端的多样性，与现有工作相比获得更好的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为联邦学习领域提供了一个更全面的多域非IID数据处理方案，通过AdaFD框架有效地解决了语言域多样性带来的挑战。

Abstract: The widespread success of pre-trained language models has established a new
training paradigm, where a global PLM is fine-tuned using task-specific data
from local clients. The local data are highly different from each other and can
not capture the global distribution of the whole data in real world. To address
the challenges of non-IID data in real environments, privacy-preserving
federated distillation has been proposed and highly investigated. However,
previous experimental non-IID scenarios are primarily identified with the label
(output) diversity, without considering the diversity of language domains
(input) that is crucial in natural language processing. In this paper, we
introduce a comprehensive set of multi-domain non-IID scenarios and propose a
unified benchmarking framework that includes diverse data. The benchmark can be
used to evaluate the federated learning framework in a real environment. To
this end, we propose an Adaptive Federated Distillation (AdaFD) framework
designed to address multi-domain non-IID challenges in both homogeneous and
heterogeneous settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our models
capture the diversity of local clients and achieve better performance compared
to the existing works. The code for this paper is available at:

Motivation: 传统抽取式摘要模型存在多阶段流水线导致信息损失和架构瓶颈，且对复杂搜索意图的语义理解不足，无法满足大规模网络搜索的实时需求。

Method: 整合大型模型蒸馏、监督微调、直接偏好优化和前瞻解码技术，将轻量级模型（仅0.1B参数）转化为领域专业化查询驱动文本摘要专家。

Result: 在多个行业相关指标上超越生产基线，达到新的最先进水平；部署效率优异，仅需334个NVIDIA L20 GPU即可处理约50,000 QPS，平均延迟55ms。

Conclusion: 生成式模型在工业级查询驱动文本摘要任务中具有显著优势，能够有效解决传统方法的局限性，实现高效实时的摘要生成。

Abstract: In the dynamic landscape of large-scale web search, Query-Driven Text
Summarization (QDTS) aims to generate concise and informative summaries from
textual documents based on a given query, which is essential for improving user
engagement and facilitating rapid decision-making. Traditional extractive
summarization models, based primarily on ranking candidate summary segments,
have been the dominant approach in industrial applications. However, these
approaches suffer from two key limitations: 1) The multi-stage pipeline often
introduces cumulative information loss and architectural bottlenecks due to its
weakest component; 2) Traditional models lack sufficient semantic understanding
of both user queries and documents, particularly when dealing with complex
search intents. In this study, we propose a novel framework to pioneer the
application of generative models to address real-time QDTS in industrial web
search. Our approach integrates large model distillation, supervised
fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and lookahead decoding to
transform a lightweight model with only 0.1B parameters into a
domain-specialized QDTS expert. Evaluated on multiple industry-relevant
metrics, our model outperforms the production baseline and achieves a new state
of the art. Furthermore, it demonstrates excellent deployment efficiency,
requiring only 334 NVIDIA L20 GPUs to handle \textasciitilde50,000 queries per
second under 55~ms average latency per query.

Motivation: 多跳问答面临数据稀疏性挑战，现有方法生成简单问题而忽略知识整合，需要提升知识组合的多样性

Method: 将知识组合选择建模为句子级条件预测任务，使用概率对比损失预测最相关的知识片段，推理时采用随机解码策略平衡准确性和多样性

Result: 知识组合选择准确率提升3.9%，在HotpotQA和2WikiMultihopQA数据集上通过数据增强获得改进

Conclusion: KCS框架有效提升了多跳问答中知识组合的多样性和准确性，为数据稀疏性问题提供了解决方案

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering faces substantial challenges due to data
sparsity, which increases the likelihood of language models learning spurious
patterns. To address this issue, prior research has focused on diversifying
question generation through content planning and varied expression. However,
these approaches often emphasize generating simple questions and neglect the
integration of essential knowledge, such as relevant sentences within
documents. This paper introduces the Knowledge Composition Sampling (KCS), an
innovative framework designed to expand the diversity of generated multi-hop
questions by sampling varied knowledge compositions within a given context. KCS
models the knowledge composition selection as a sentence-level conditional
prediction task and utilizes a probabilistic contrastive loss to predict the
next most relevant piece of knowledge. During inference, we employ a stochastic
decoding strategy to effectively balance accuracy and diversity. Compared to
competitive baselines, our KCS improves the overall accuracy of knowledge
composition selection by 3.9%, and its application for data augmentation yields
improvements on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA datasets. Our code is available

Motivation: 现有图语言模型的评估基准主要基于重用的节点分类数据集，这些基准无法有效评估多模态推理能力，因为仅使用单模态信息就能获得强性能表现，不能真正测试图-语言整合的必要性。

Method: 引入CLEGR（组合式语言-图推理）基准，采用合成图生成流程配合需要结构和文本语义联合推理的问题，在不同复杂度级别上评估多模态推理能力。对代表性GLM架构进行全面评估。

Result: 软提示LLM基线与包含完整GNN骨干的GLM性能相当，质疑了将图结构整合到LLM中的架构必要性。GLM在需要结构推理的任务上表现出显著的性能下降。

Conclusion: 当前GLM在图推理能力方面存在局限性，研究结果为推动社区发展涉及图结构和语言的显式多模态推理提供了基础，需要更有效的评估方法和模型架构改进。

Abstract: Developments in Graph-Language Models (GLMs) aim to integrate the structural
reasoning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the semantic
understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, we demonstrate that
current evaluation benchmarks for GLMs, which are primarily repurposed
node-level classification datasets, are insufficient to assess multimodal
reasoning. Our analysis reveals that strong performance on these benchmarks is
achievable using unimodal information alone, suggesting that they do not
necessitate graph-language integration. To address this evaluation gap, we
introduce the CLEGR(Compositional Language-Graph Reasoning) benchmark, designed
to evaluate multimodal reasoning at various complexity levels. Our benchmark
employs a synthetic graph generation pipeline paired with questions that
require joint reasoning over structure and textual semantics. We perform a
thorough evaluation of representative GLM architectures and find that
soft-prompted LLM baselines perform on par with GLMs that incorporate a full
GNN backbone. This result calls into question the architectural necessity of
incorporating graph structure into LLMs. We further show that GLMs exhibit
significant performance degradation in tasks that require structural reasoning.
These findings highlight limitations in the graph reasoning capabilities of
current GLMs and provide a foundation for advancing the community toward
explicit multimodal reasoning involving graph structure and language.

<details>

Motivation: 结构化的识别系统经常无法准确识别域特定命名实体，导致下游任务出现灾难性失败。现有的语音编辑距离方法在词形差异较大时无法准确定位错误词汇。

Method: 提出一种新的命名实体编正方法：利用语音声音特征检索候选实体，然后设计生成式方法来标注ASR译文中的实体错误并替换为正确实体。

Result: 在开源和自构测试集上证明，该方法能够显著提高实体准确率，尤其在词形差异较大的场景下效果更佳。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了传统NEC方法在词形差异较大时的限制，并将开源自构测试集和训练数据。

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition systems often fail to transcribe
domain-specific named entities, causing catastrophic failures in downstream
tasks. Numerous fast and lightweight named entity correction (NEC) models have
been proposed in recent years. These models, mainly leveraging phonetic-level
edit distance algorithms, have shown impressive performances. However, when the
forms of the wrongly-transcribed words(s) and the ground-truth entity are
significantly different, these methods often fail to locate the wrongly
transcribed words in hypothesis, thus limiting their usage. We propose a novel
NEC method that utilizes speech sound features to retrieve candidate entities.
With speech sound features and candidate entities, we inovatively design a
generative method to annotate entity errors in ASR transcripts and replace the
text with correct entities. This method is effective in scenarios of word form
difference. We test our method using open-source and self-constructed test
sets. The results demonstrate that our NEC method can bring significant
improvement to entity accuracy. We will open source our self-constructed test
set and training data.

Conclusion: 任务特定的微调在隐式篇章关系识别中优于提示方法，层次化方法有效。HArch模型在多语言和多标签设置下表现出色，为篇章分析提供了强有力的工具。

Abstract: This paper introduces the first multi-lingual and multi-label classification
model for implicit discourse relation recognition (IDRR). Our model, HArch, is
evaluated on the recently released DiscoGeM 2.0 corpus and leverages
hierarchical dependencies between discourse senses to predict probability
distributions across all three sense levels in the PDTB 3.0 framework. We
compare several pre-trained encoder backbones and find that RoBERTa-HArch
achieves the best performance in English, while XLM-RoBERTa-HArch performs best
in the multi-lingual setting. In addition, we compare our fine-tuned models
against GPT-4o and Llama-4-Maverick using few-shot prompting across all
language configurations. Our results show that our fine-tuned models
consistently outperform these LLMs, highlighting the advantages of
task-specific fine-tuning over prompting in IDRR. Finally, we report SOTA
results on the DiscoGeM 1.0 corpus, further validating the effectiveness of our
hierarchical approach.

### [28] [Addressing Tokenization Inconsistency in Steganography and Watermarking Based on Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20718)
*Ruiyi Yan,Yugo Murawaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究大型语言模型在文本隐写和水印中的tokenization不一致问题，发现导致该问题的token具有低频性和临时性特征，并提出了针对性的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型提升了文本生成能力，一方面改善了文本隐写质量，另一方面也凸显了水印技术防止恶意滥用的重要性。但隐写和水印中Alice和Bob之间的tokenization不一致会破坏鲁棒性，需要解决。

Method: 通过研究发现导致tokenization不一致的问题token具有低频性和临时性特征，据此提出了两种定制解决方案：针对隐写的逐步验证方法和针对水印的事后回滚方法。

Result: 实验表明：(1)与传统隐写消歧方法相比，直接解决tokenization不一致问题能提升流畅性、不可感知性和抗隐写分析能力；(2)对于水印，解决该问题能增强可检测性和抗攻击鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 识别和解决tokenization不一致问题对于提升文本隐写和水印技术的性能至关重要，提出的两种方法分别在各自领域取得了显著改进效果。

Abstract: Large language models have significantly enhanced the capacities and
efficiency of text generation. On the one hand, they have improved the quality
of text-based steganography. On the other hand, they have also underscored the
importance of watermarking as a safeguard against malicious misuse. In this
study, we focus on tokenization inconsistency (TI) between Alice and Bob in
steganography and watermarking, where TI can undermine robustness. Our
investigation reveals that the problematic tokens responsible for TI exhibit
two key characteristics: infrequency and temporariness. Based on these
findings, we propose two tailored solutions for TI elimination: a stepwise
verification method for steganography and a post-hoc rollback method for
watermarking. Experiments show that (1) compared to traditional disambiguation
methods in steganography, directly addressing TI leads to improvements in
fluency, imperceptibility, and anti-steganalysis capacity; (2) for
watermarking, addressing TI enhances detectability and robustness against
attacks.

TL;DR: rStar2-Agent是一个14B参数的数学推理模型，通过智能体强化学习训练，在有限GPU资源下实现前沿性能，在AIME数学竞赛中超越DeepSeek-R1等大型模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前长链思维推理模型存在计算成本高、推理效率低的问题，需要开发能够在代码环境中有效推理、自主验证和优化中间步骤的智能体模型

Method: 采用三阶段训练方法：非推理SFT预训练、多阶段RL训练，结合GRPO-RoC算法和重采样策略，在高效Python代码环境中进行高吞吐量执行

Result: 在AIME24和AIME25上分别达到80.6%和69.8%的平均pass@1分数，超越DeepSeek-R1(671B)，响应更短，仅用510步RL训练和一周时间

Conclusion: 该方法证明了智能体强化学习在数学推理任务中的有效性，模型展现出先进的认知行为，并能泛化到对齐、科学推理和工具使用任务

Abstract: We introduce rStar2-Agent, a 14B math reasoning model trained with agentic
reinforcement learning to achieve frontier-level performance. Beyond current
long CoT, the model demonstrates advanced cognitive behaviors, such as thinking
carefully before using Python coding tools and reflecting on code execution
feedback to autonomously explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps in
complex problem-solving. This capability is enabled through three key
innovations that makes agentic RL effective at scale: (i) an efficient RL
infrastructure with a reliable Python code environment that supports
high-throughput execution and mitigates the high rollout costs, enabling
training on limited GPU resources (64 MI300X GPUs); (ii) GRPO-RoC, an agentic
RL algorithm with a Resample-on-Correct rollout strategy that addresses the
inherent environment noises from coding tools, allowing the model to reason
more effectively in a code environment; (iii) An efficient agent training
recipe that starts with non-reasoning SFT and progresses through multi-RL
stages, yielding advanced cognitive abilities with minimal compute cost. To
this end, rStar2-Agent boosts a pre-trained 14B model to state of the art in
only 510 RL steps within one week, achieving average pass@1 scores of 80.6% on
AIME24 and 69.8% on AIME25, surpassing DeepSeek-R1 (671B) with significantly
shorter responses. Beyond mathematics, rStar2-Agent-14B also demonstrates
strong generalization to alignment, scientific reasoning, and agentic tool-use
tasks. Code and training recipes are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了DP-ST方法，利用语义三元组在本地差分隐私下实现邻域感知的文档生成，通过分治策略和LLM后处理在较低ε值下平衡隐私与效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的本地差分隐私文本处理方法在低ε值下效果不佳，需要找到在合理隐私预算下仍能保持文本连贯性的方法。

Method: 提出DP-ST方法，使用语义三元组进行邻域感知的私有文档生成，采用分治策略并限制隐私邻域概念，结合LLM进行后处理。

Result: 该方法在较低ε值下仍能生成连贯文本，有效平衡了隐私保护和文本效用。

Conclusion: 文本连贯性对于在合理ε水平下实现平衡的隐私化输出至关重要，分治策略和邻域限制是有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Many works at the intersection of Differential Privacy (DP) in Natural
Language Processing aim to protect privacy by transforming texts under DP
guarantees. This can be performed in a variety of ways, from word perturbations
to full document rewriting, and most often under local DP. Here, an input text
must be made indistinguishable from any other potential text, within some bound
governed by the privacy parameter $\varepsilon$. Such a guarantee is quite
demanding, and recent works show that privatizing texts under local DP can only
be done reasonably under very high $\varepsilon$ values. Addressing this
challenge, we introduce DP-ST, which leverages semantic triples for
neighborhood-aware private document generation under local DP guarantees.
Through the evaluation of our method, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the
divide-and-conquer paradigm, particularly when limiting the DP notion (and
privacy guarantees) to that of a privatization neighborhood. When combined with
LLM post-processing, our method allows for coherent text generation even at
lower $\varepsilon$ values, while still balancing privacy and utility. These
findings highlight the importance of coherence in achieving balanced
privatization outputs at reasonable $\varepsilon$ levels.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过微调基于大语言模型的通用嵌入模型（如Stella、Jasper、NV-Embed和E5），在隐式仇恨言论检测任务上取得了最先进的性能表现，在数据集内和跨数据集评估中均有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式仇恨言论（IHS）使用间接语言、微妙暗示、讽刺或编码术语来表达偏见或仇恨，由于不包含明确的贬损性词语，检测难度很大。传统方法需要依赖外部知识或额外信息（如上下文、情感和情绪数据）。

Method: 仅通过微调基于大语言模型的通用嵌入模型（包括Stella、Jasper、NV-Embed和E5），不依赖额外的外部知识或上下文信息。

Result: 在多个IHS数据集上的实验显示：数据集内评估F1-macro得分提升最高达1.10个百分点，跨数据集评估提升最高达20.35个百分点。

Conclusion: 微调通用嵌入模型是检测隐式仇恨言论的有效方法，无需复杂的外部知识或额外信息，就能实现最先进的性能表现。

Abstract: Implicit hate speech (IHS) is indirect language that conveys prejudice or
hatred through subtle cues, sarcasm or coded terminology. IHS is challenging to
detect as it does not include explicit derogatory or inflammatory words. To
address this challenge, task-specific pipelines can be complemented with
external knowledge or additional information such as context, emotions and
sentiment data. In this paper, we show that, by solely fine-tuning recent
general-purpose embedding models based on large language models (LLMs), such as
Stella, Jasper, NV-Embed and E5, we achieve state-of-the-art performance.
Experiments on multiple IHS datasets show up to 1.10 percentage points
improvements for in-dataset, and up to 20.35 percentage points improvements in
cross-dataset evaluation, in terms of F1-macro score.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放文本生成中连贯性与多样性平衡的挑战，现有对比搜索解码方法存在超参数依赖和计算成本高的问题。

Method: 提出GUARD自适应性解码方法，结合全局熵估计和局部熵偏差，整合长短期不确定性信号，并加入基于token计数的惩罚机制降低计算开销。

Result: 实验表明GUARD在文本多样性和连贯性之间取得良好平衡，生成速度显著提升，人类和LLM评估者均验证其优异性能。

Conclusion: GUARD通过创新的不确定性驱动框架有效解决了文本生成的质量-效率权衡问题，为实际应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Open-ended text generation faces a critical challenge: balancing coherence
with diversity in LLM outputs. While contrastive search-based decoding
strategies have emerged to address this trade-off, their practical utility is
often limited by hyperparameter dependence and high computational costs. We
introduce GUARD, a self-adaptive decoding method that effectively balances
these competing objectives through a novel "Glocal" uncertainty-driven
framework. GUARD combines global entropy estimates with local entropy
deviations to integrate both long-term and short-term uncertainty signals. We
demonstrate that our proposed global entropy formulation effectively mitigates
abrupt variations in uncertainty, such as sudden overconfidence or high entropy
spikes, and provides theoretical guarantees of unbiasedness and consistency. To
reduce computational overhead, we incorporate a simple yet effective
token-count-based penalty into GUARD. Experimental results demonstrate that
GUARD achieves a good balance between text diversity and coherence, while
exhibiting substantial improvements in generation speed. In a more nuanced
comparison study across different dimensions of text quality, both human and
LLM evaluators validated its remarkable performance. Our code is available at
https://github.com/YecanLee/GUARD.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究比较了真实认知行为治疗对话与LLM生成对话的情感动态差异，发现虽然合成对话流畅连贯，但在情感变异性、情感语言丰富度和情感反应模式等方面与真实对话存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型生成的合成治疗对话在心理健康NLP中广泛应用，需要验证这些合成对话是否能捕捉真实治疗中细腻的情感动态。

Method: 采用Utterance Emotion Dynamics框架分析情感轨迹，比较真实CBT会话（来自公共视频转录）和合成对话（来自CACTUS数据集）在效价、唤醒度和支配度三个维度上的差异。

Result: 合成对话虽然流畅结构连贯，但在情感特性上与真实对话存在差异：真实会话表现出更大的情感变异性、更多情感丰富的语言，以及更真实的反应和调节模式。真实与合成说话者之间的情感弧相似度较低，特别是客户角色。

Conclusion: 当前LLM生成的治疗数据存在局限性，情感保真度在心理健康应用中至关重要。研究引入了RealCBT真实CBT会话数据集以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Synthetic therapy dialogues generated by large language models (LLMs) are
increasingly used in mental health NLP to simulate counseling scenarios, train
models, and supplement limited real-world data. However, it remains unclear
whether these synthetic conversations capture the nuanced emotional dynamics of
real therapy. In this work, we conduct the first comparative analysis of
emotional arcs between real and LLM-generated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
dialogues. We adapt the Utterance Emotion Dynamics framework to analyze
fine-grained affective trajectories across valence, arousal, and dominance
dimensions. Our analysis spans both full dialogues and individual speaker roles
(counselor and client), using real sessions transcribed from public videos and
synthetic dialogues from the CACTUS dataset. We find that while synthetic
dialogues are fluent and structurally coherent, they diverge from real
conversations in key emotional properties: real sessions exhibit greater
emotional variability,more emotion-laden language, and more authentic patterns
of reactivity and regulation. Moreover, emotional arc similarity between real
and synthetic speakers is low, especially for clients. These findings
underscore the limitations of current LLM-generated therapy data and highlight
the importance of emotional fidelity in mental health applications. We
introduce RealCBT, a curated dataset of real CBT sessions, to support future
research in this space.

TL;DR: ROSI是一种白盒方法，通过向拒绝调节子空间永久引导激活来增强LLM的安全对齐，无需微调即可提高安全拒绝率并保持模型效用


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全机制容易被绕过，需要一种简单有效的方法来增强LLM的安全对齐能力

Method: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI)，通过计算有害和无害指令对的安全方向，对所有残差流写入矩阵应用简单的秩一权重修改

Result: ROSI一致提高了安全拒绝率（Llama Guard 3评估），同时在MMLU、HellaSwag和Arc等标准基准上保持模型效用，还能重新对齐'未审查'模型

Conclusion: 有针对性的、可解释的权重引导是改善LLM安全的廉价而有效的机制，可作为资源密集型微调范式的补充

Abstract: Safety alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) often involves mediating
internal representations to refuse harmful requests. Recent research has
demonstrated that these safety mechanisms can be bypassed by ablating or
removing specific representational directions within the model. In this paper,
we propose the opposite approach: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI), a white-box
method that amplifies a model's safety alignment by permanently steering its
activations toward the refusal-mediating subspace. ROSI operates as a simple,
fine-tuning-free rank-one weight modification applied to all residual stream
write matrices. The required safety direction can be computed from a small set
of harmful and harmless instruction pairs. We show that ROSI consistently
increases safety refusal rates - as evaluated by Llama Guard 3 - while
preserving the utility of the model on standard benchmarks such as MMLU,
HellaSwag, and Arc. Furthermore, we show that ROSI can also re-align
'uncensored' models by amplifying their own latent safety directions,
demonstrating its utility as an effective last-mile safety procedure. Our
results suggest that targeted, interpretable weight steering is a cheap and
potent mechanism to improve LLM safety, complementing more resource-intensive
fine-tuning paradigms.

Abstract: Rising mental health issues among youth have increased interest in automated
approaches for detecting early signs of psychological distress in digital text.
One key focus is the identification of cognitive distortions, irrational
thought patterns that have a role in aggravating mental distress. Early
detection of these distortions may enable timely, low-cost interventions. While
prior work has focused on English clinical data, we present the first in-depth
study of cross-lingual and cross-register generalization of cognitive
distortion detection, analyzing forum posts written by Dutch adolescents. Our
findings show that while changes in language and writing style can
significantly affect model performance, domain adaptation methods show the most
promise.

Conclusion: GDLLM框架通过有效捕捉全局特征，显著提升了少数关系类别的性能，增强了整体学习能力

Abstract: In Natural Language Processing(NLP), Event Temporal Relation Extraction
(ETRE) is to recognize the temporal relations of two events. Prior studies have
noted the importance of language models for ETRE. However, the restricted
pre-trained knowledge of Small Language Models(SLMs) limits their capability to
handle minority class relations in imbalanced classification datasets. For
Large Language Models(LLMs), researchers adopt manually designed prompts or
instructions, which may introduce extra noise, leading to interference with the
model's judgment of the long-distance dependencies between events. To address
these issues, we propose GDLLM, a Global Distance-aware modeling approach based
on LLMs. We first present a distance-aware graph structure utilizing Graph
Attention Network(GAT) to assist the LLMs in capturing long-distance dependency
features. Additionally, we design a temporal feature learning paradigm based on
soft inference to augment the identification of relations with a short-distance
proximity band, which supplements the probabilistic information generated by
LLMs into the multi-head attention mechanism. Since the global feature can be
captured effectively, our framework substantially enhances the performance of
minority relation classes and improves the overall learning ability.
Experiments on two publicly available datasets, TB-Dense and MATRES,
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个可扩展的多源检索和综合评测框架，用于评估RAG系统在需要从多个来源整合信息并生成长文本回应的应用场景中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG系统评估通常假设信息可以从单个来源获得或者回答是短式事实性的，而实际应用中需要从多个分散来源整合和汇总信息。

Method: 设计了一个可扩展的评测框架，并构建了两个新的标准测试集MSRS-Story和MSRS-Meet，分别代表故事综合和摘要任务，使用各种RAG流水线（包括稀疏和浓密检索器）进行实验。

Result: 实验结果显示生成质量很大程度依赖于检索效果，而检索效果因任务而异。在理想检索设置下，多源综合仍然具有挑战性，理解模型在这一步骤表现显著超过标准LLM。

Conclusion: 多源信息整合是RAG系统面临的重要挑战，需要同时改善检索效果和生成能力，理解模型在综合步骤中显示出明显优势。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented systems are typically evaluated in settings where
information required to answer the query can be found within a single source or
the answer is short-form or factoid-based. However, many real-world
applications demand the ability to integrate and summarize information
scattered across multiple sources, where no single source is sufficient to
respond to the user's question. In such settings, the retrieval component of a
RAG pipeline must recognize a variety of relevance signals, and the generation
component must connect and synthesize information across multiple sources. We
present a scalable framework for constructing evaluation benchmarks that
challenge RAG systems to integrate information across distinct sources and
generate long-form responses. Using our framework, we build two new benchmarks
on Multi-Source Retrieval and Synthesis: MSRS-Story and MSRS-Meet, representing
narrative synthesis and summarization tasks, respectively, that require
retrieval from large collections. Our extensive experiments with various RAG
pipelines -- including sparse and dense retrievers combined with frontier LLMs
-- reveal that generation quality is highly dependent on retrieval
effectiveness, which varies greatly by task. While multi-source synthesis
proves challenging even in an oracle retrieval setting, we find that reasoning
models significantly outperform standard LLMs at this distinct step.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化技术对于在资源受限硬件上部署大语言模型至关重要，但其在多语言任务中的影响仍未得到充分探索。需要系统性地评估量化在机器翻译任务中的表现。

Method: 使用5个从1.7B到70B参数的大语言模型，在55种语言上进行后训练量化评估。比较四种量化技术（AWQ、BitsAndBytes、GGUF和AutoRound），分析4位和2位精度下的表现。还分析了量化与解码超参数、校准语言之间的交互作用。

Result: 4位量化在高资源语言和大模型中能保持翻译质量，但2位量化对低资源和语言类型多样的语言造成显著性能下降。GGUF方法在各种精度下都提供最一致的性能，语言匹配的校准在低位场景中有显著优势。

Conclusion: 量化算法选择和模型大小共同决定了多语言机器翻译的稳健性。研究给出了在量化约束下部署多语言LLM的可行性建议，尤其是在低资源环境中。

Abstract: Quantization is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) on
resource-constrained hardware, but its implications for multilingual tasks
remain underexplored. We conduct the first large-scale evaluation of
post-training quantization (PTQ) on machine translation across 55 languages
using five LLMs ranging from 1.7B to 70B parameters. Our analysis reveals that
while 4-bit quantization often preserves translation quality for high-resource
languages and large models, significant degradation occurs for low-resource and
typologically diverse languages, particularly in 2-bit settings. We compare
four quantization techniques (AWQ, BitsAndBytes, GGUF, and AutoRound), showing
that algorithm choice and model size jointly determine robustness. GGUF
variants provide the most consistent performance, even at 2-bit precision.
Additionally, we quantify the interactions between quantization, decoding
hyperparameters, and calibration languages, finding that language-matched
calibration offers benefits primarily in low-bit scenarios. Our findings offer
actionable insights for deploying multilingual LLMs for machine translation
under quantization constraints, especially in low-resource settings.

Motivation: 当前语音到语音大语言模型的评估存在根本性挑战，级联方法忽视了声学特征，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 提出SageLM模型，联合评估语义和声学维度；利用理性监督增强可解释性；引入SpeechFeedback合成偏好数据集；采用两阶段训练范式缓解语音偏好数据稀缺问题。

Conclusion: SageLM为语音到语音大语言模型提供了全面、可解释的评估框架，在评估准确性和可解释性方面显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Speech-to-Speech (S2S) Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational to
natural human-computer interaction, enabling end-to-end spoken dialogue
systems. However, evaluating these models remains a fundamental challenge. We
propose \texttt{SageLM}, an end-to-end, multi-aspect, and explainable speech
LLM for comprehensive S2S LLMs evaluation. First, unlike cascaded approaches
that disregard acoustic features, SageLM jointly assesses both semantic and
acoustic dimensions. Second, it leverages rationale-based supervision to
enhance explainability and guide model learning, achieving superior alignment
with evaluation outcomes compared to rule-based reinforcement learning methods.
Third, we introduce \textit{SpeechFeedback}, a synthetic preference dataset,
and employ a two-stage training paradigm to mitigate the scarcity of speech
preference data. Trained on both semantic and acoustic dimensions, SageLM
achieves an 82.79\% agreement rate with human evaluators, outperforming
cascaded and SLM-based baselines by at least 7.42\% and 26.20\%, respectively.

Conclusion: IRMA框架在动态环境中展现出卓越的可靠性和一致性，为解决LLM工具调用中的长期推理问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning and planning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) have enabled their potential as autonomous agents capable of tool
use in dynamic environments. However, in multi-turn conversational environments
like $\tau$-bench, these agents often struggle with consistent reasoning,
adherence to domain-specific policies, and extracting correct information over
a long horizon of tool-calls and conversation. To capture and mitigate these
failures, we conduct a comprehensive manual analysis of the common errors
occurring in the conversation trajectories. We then experiment with
reformulations of inputs to the tool-calling agent for improvement in agent
decision making. Finally, we propose the Input-Reformulation Multi-Agent (IRMA)
framework, which automatically reformulates user queries augmented with
relevant domain rules and tool suggestions for the tool-calling agent to focus
on. The results show that IRMA significantly outperforms ReAct, Function
Calling, and Self-Reflection by 16.1%, 12.7%, and 19.1%, respectively, in
overall pass^5 scores. These findings highlight the superior reliability and
consistency of IRMA compared to other methods in dynamic environments.

*Jiaqian Li,Qisheng Hu,Jing Li,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的两阶段示例选择策略，通过结构感知监督微调BERT检索器，并添加可插拔模块增强句法信息，显著提升语义解析任务中的上下文学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ICL选择策略在结构化预测任务中往往忽略结构对齐，导致性能不佳和泛化能力差。需要一种既能保持语义相关性又能确保结构对齐的示例选择方法。

Method: 两阶段策略：1）使用结构感知监督微调BERT检索器；2）添加模型无关的可插拔模块增强隐藏表示中的句法信息。该方法高效、通用且易于集成。

Result: 在四个基准测试和三个语义解析任务上的实验表明，该方法在多个最新LLM作为推理模型时均一致优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在效率、泛化性和性能之间实现了良好平衡，为结构化预测任务的上下文学习提供了有效的示例选择解决方案。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has become a powerful paradigm that enables LLMs to
perform a wide range of tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. However, the
effectiveness of ICL heavily depends on the quality of exemplar selection. In
particular, for structured prediction tasks such as semantic parsing, existing
ICL selection strategies often overlook structural alignment, leading to
suboptimal performance and poor generalization. To address this issue, we
propose a novel two-stage exemplar selection strategy that achieves a strong
balance between efficiency, generalizability, and performance. First, we
fine-tune a BERT-based retriever using structure-aware supervision, guiding it
to select exemplars that are both semantically relevant and structurally
aligned. Then, we enhance the retriever with a plug-in module, which amplifies
syntactically meaningful information in the hidden representations. This
plug-in is model-agnostic, requires minimal overhead, and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing pipelines. Experiments on four benchmarks spanning
three semantic parsing tasks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing baselines with multiple recent LLMs as inference-time
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主动对话研究主要集中在特定领域或任务导向场景，导致评估碎片化，限制了全面探索模型的主动对话能力。

Method: 提出ProactiveEval框架，将主动对话分解为目标规划和对话引导，建立跨领域评估指标，并支持自动生成多样化评估数据。

Result: 在22种不同类型的大语言模型实验中，DeepSeek-R1和Claude-3.7-Sonnet分别在目标规划和对话引导任务上表现优异。

Conclusion: 研究了推理能力对主动行为的影响，并讨论了其对未来模型发展的启示，为主动对话评估提供了统一框架。

Abstract: Proactive dialogue has emerged as a critical and challenging research problem
in advancing large language models (LLMs). Existing works predominantly focus
on domain-specific or task-oriented scenarios, which leads to fragmented
evaluations and limits the comprehensive exploration of models' proactive
conversation abilities. In this work, we propose ProactiveEval, a unified
framework designed for evaluating proactive dialogue capabilities of LLMs. This
framework decomposes proactive dialogue into target planning and dialogue
guidance, establishing evaluation metrics across various domains. Moreover, it
also enables the automatic generation of diverse and challenging evaluation
data. Based on the proposed framework, we develop 328 evaluation environments
spanning 6 distinct domains. Through experiments with 22 different types of
LLMs, we show that DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-3.7-Sonnet exhibit exceptional
performance on target planning and dialogue guidance tasks, respectively.
Finally, we investigate how reasoning capabilities influence proactive
behaviors and discuss their implications for future model development.

TL;DR: LETHE是一种通过知识稀释消除LLM后门行为的新方法，结合内部模型合并和外部提示增强，在多种攻击场景下显著降低攻击成功率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门防御方法存在局限性，无法应对模型编辑、多触发器和无触发器等高级攻击场景，需要更全面的防御方案

Method: 内部机制：使用轻量数据集训练干净模型，与后门模型合并以稀释后门影响；外部机制：在提示中加入良性相关证据分散模型对后门特征的注意力

Result: 在5个主流LLM上测试8种后门攻击，LETHE优于8个SOTA防御基线，将高级后门攻击成功率降低高达98%，同时保持模型效用

Conclusion: LETHE是一种高效、成本效益高且鲁棒的后门消除方法，能够有效应对各种复杂的后门攻击场景

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen significant advancements, achieving
superior performance in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.
However, they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where models behave
normally for standard queries but generate harmful responses or unintended
output when specific triggers are activated. Existing backdoor defenses either
lack comprehensiveness, focusing on narrow trigger settings, detection-only
mechanisms, and limited domains, or fail to withstand advanced scenarios like
model-editing-based, multi-trigger, and triggerless attacks. In this paper, we
present LETHE, a novel method to eliminate backdoor behaviors from LLMs through
knowledge dilution using both internal and external mechanisms. Internally,
LETHE leverages a lightweight dataset to train a clean model, which is then
merged with the backdoored model to neutralize malicious behaviors by diluting
the backdoor impact within the model's parametric memory. Externally, LETHE
incorporates benign and semantically relevant evidence into the prompt to
distract LLM's attention from backdoor features. Experimental results on
classification and generation domains across 5 widely used LLMs demonstrate
that LETHE outperforms 8 state-of-the-art defense baselines against 8 backdoor
attacks. LETHE reduces the attack success rate of advanced backdoor attacks by
up to 98% while maintaining model utility. Furthermore, LETHE has proven to be
cost-efficient and robust against adaptive backdoor attacks.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful solution to
mitigate the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
hallucinations and outdated knowledge. However, deploying RAG-based tools in
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) remains a challenge due to their limited
resources and lack of expertise in natural language processing (NLP). This
paper introduces EASI-RAG, Enterprise Application Support for Industrial RAG, a
structured, agile method designed to facilitate the deployment of RAG systems
in industrial SME contexts. EASI-RAG is based on method engineering principles
and comprises well-defined roles, activities, and techniques. The method was
validated through a real-world case study in an environmental testing
laboratory, where a RAG tool was implemented to answer operators queries using
data extracted from operational procedures. The system was deployed in under a
month by a team with no prior RAG experience and was later iteratively improved
based on user feedback. Results demonstrate that EASI-RAG supports fast
implementation, high user adoption, delivers accurate answers, and enhances the
reliability of underlying data. This work highlights the potential of RAG
deployment in industrial SMEs. Future works include the need for generalization
across diverse use cases and further integration with fine-tuned models.

Motivation: 解决句级关系提取任务中的挑战，特别是在距离监督数据集上的标签噪声和表示学习问题。

Method: 使用胶囊网络中的动态路由机制来进行句子关系提取，对比了在Tacred、Tacredrev、Retacred和Conll04数据集上的表现。

Result: 在标准数据集上超过最新技术，但在更大的Wikidata数据集上表现差异。发现标签噪声和重新表示能力是关键因素。

Conclusion: 距离监督关系提取中除了标签噪声外，重新表示能力也是重要挑战，胶囊动态路由模型在重新表示方面表现更好。

Abstract: Sentential relation extraction (RE) is an important task in natural language
processing (NLP). In this paper we propose to do sentential RE with dynamic
routing in capsules. We first show that the proposed approach outperform state
of the art on common sentential relation extraction datasets Tacred, Tacredrev,
Retacred, and Conll04. We then investigate potential reasons for its good
performance on the mentioned datasets, and yet low performance on another
similar, yet larger sentential RE dataset, Wikidata. As such, we identify noise
in Wikidata labels as one of the reasons that can hinder performance.
Additionally, we show associativity of better performance with better
re-representation, a term from neuroscience referred to change of
representation in human brain to improve the match at comparison time. As
example, in the given analogous terms King:Queen::Man:Woman, at comparison
time, and as a result of re-representation, the similarity between related head
terms (King,Man), and tail terms (Queen,Woman) increases. As such, our
observation show that our proposed model can do re-representation better than
the vanilla model compared with. To that end, beside noise in the labels of the
distantly supervised RE datasets, we propose re-representation as a challenge
in sentential RE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 税务申报复杂且耗时，传统LLM方法准确性和可审计性不足，需要开发高精度、可审计的自动化税务计算系统

Method: 集成LLM与符号求解器，将文本规则转换为形式逻辑程序，结合智能检索的案例表示示例

Result: 在SARA数据集上性能显著提升，部署成本远低于现实世界平均错误成本

Conclusion: 神经符号架构有望实现经济可行的可靠税务辅助系统，促进公平获取税务服务

Abstract: According to the United States Internal Revenue Service, ''the average
American spends $\$270$ and 13 hours filing their taxes''. Even beyond the
U.S., tax filing requires complex reasoning, combining application of
overlapping rules with numerical calculations. Because errors can incur costly
penalties, any automated system must deliver high accuracy and auditability,
making modern large language models (LLMs) poorly suited for this task. We
propose an approach that integrates LLMs with a symbolic solver to calculate
tax obligations. We evaluate variants of this system on the challenging
StAtutory Reasoning Assessment (SARA) dataset, and include a novel method for
estimating the cost of deploying such a system based on real-world penalties
for tax errors. We further show how combining up-front translation of
plain-text rules into formal logic programs, combined with intelligently
retrieved exemplars for formal case representations, can dramatically improve
performance on this task and reduce costs to well below real-world averages.
Our results demonstrate the promise and economic feasibility of neuro-symbolic
architectures for increasing equitable access to reliable tax assistance.

TL;DR: 通过CHAIR指标和DPO对齐训练，有效减少多模态大语言模型的幻觉现象


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MLLMs在解释视觉输入时产生幻觉内容的长期问题，将幻觉问题视为对齐问题

Method: 利用CHAIR指标识别非幻觉和幻觉样本，通过直接偏好优化(DPO)对现有MLLMs进行精细调整

Result: CHAIR-DPO方法在多个幻觉测试集上显著减少了幻觉回答的数量

Conclusion: 使用CHAIR基于的奖励进行精细调整可有效控制MLLMs的幻觉现象

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) emerge as a unified interface to
address a multitude of tasks, ranging from NLP to computer vision. Despite
showcasing state-of-the-art results in many benchmarks, a long-standing issue
is the tendency of MLLMs to hallucinate, that is to generate answers to the
user's query that are not reflected in the visual input. In this paper, we
address the problem of hallucinations as an alignment problem, seeking to steer
the MLLM so that it prefers generating content without hallucinations. In
contrast to recent approaches that require complicated pipelines to build
synthetic preference data for alignment training, often relying on proprietary
models, we capitalize on the well-known CHAIR metric, originally proposed to
gauge the degree of hallucinations in image captioning. Given a pair of
generated answers, we leverage CHAIR to distinguish winner and loser options
(i.e., non-hallucinated and hallucinated samples) and fine-tune off-the-shelf
MLLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The resulting method, which we
refer to as CHAIR-DPO, effectively diminishes the amount of hallucinated
answers on several hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
fine-tuning the MLLM with a CHAIR-based reward. Source code and trained models
are publicly available at https://github.com/aimagelab/CHAIR-DPO.

Motivation: 现有图像伪造定位方法依赖人工标注数据，无法跟上多模态大模型带来的图像编辑技术发展，需要更高效的解决方案

Method: 利用SD3多模态处理能力，将高速通过高通滤波器提取的图像伪造残差作为显式模态，在训练时融合到潜空间，同时保留SD3提取的丰富语义信息

Result: 在广泛使用的标准数据集上较现有最佳方法提升12%性能，对训练未见的真实文档伪造和自然场景伪造图像也表现出强劲性能

Conclusion: 证明了SD多模态架构可以条件化地处理伪造相关信息，为图像伪造定位领域提供了一种更高效准确的新方法

Abstract: Driven by the new generation of multi-modal large models, such as Stable
Diffusion (SD), image manipulation technologies have advanced rapidly, posing
significant challenges to image forensics. However, existing image forgery
localization methods, which heavily rely on labor-intensive and costly
annotated data, are struggling to keep pace with these emerging image
manipulation technologies. To address these challenges, we are the first to
integrate both image generation and powerful perceptual capabilities of SD into
an image forensic framework, enabling more efficient and accurate forgery
localization. First, we theoretically show that the multi-modal architecture of
SD can be conditioned on forgery-related information, enabling the model to
inherently output forgery localization results. Then, building on this
foundation, we specifically leverage the multimodal framework of Stable
DiffusionV3 (SD3) to enhance forgery localization performance.We leverage the
multi-modal processing capabilities of SD3 in the latent space by treating
image forgery residuals -- high-frequency signals extracted using specific
highpass filters -- as an explicit modality. This modality is fused into the
latent space during training to enhance forgery localization performance.
Notably, our method fully preserves the latent features extracted by SD3,
thereby retaining the rich semantic information of the input image.
Experimental results show that our framework achieves up to 12% improvements in
performance on widely used benchmarking datasets compared to current
state-of-the-art image forgery localization models. Encouragingly, the model
demonstrates strong performance on forensic tasks involving real-world document
forgery images and natural scene forging images, even when such data were
entirely unseen during training.

Motivation: 当前AI模型在皮肤疾病诊断方面表现出色，但预测结果的可解释性不足限制了其临床应用。需要提高模型预测的透明度和可信度。

Method: 结合多模态大语言模型(MLLM)和定量属性分析，通过微调MLLM从皮肤病变图像预测定量属性值（如病变面积等），并使用基于内容的图像检索进行验证。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型与定量属性的结合是提升皮肤疾病AI诊断可解释性的有前景方向，为临床实践应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence models have demonstrated significant success in
diagnosing skin diseases, including cancer, showing the potential to assist
clinicians in their analysis. However, the interpretability of model
predictions must be significantly improved before they can be used in practice.
To this end, we explore the combination of two promising approaches: Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) and quantitative attribute usage. MLLMs offer a
potential avenue for increased interpretability, providing reasoning for
diagnosis in natural language through an interactive format. Separately, a
number of quantitative attributes that are related to lesion appearance (e.g.,
lesion area) have recently been found predictive of malignancy with high
accuracy. Predictions grounded as a function of such concepts have the
potential for improved interpretability. We provide evidence that MLLM
embedding spaces can be grounded in such attributes, through fine-tuning to
predict their values from images. Concretely, we evaluate this grounding in the
embedding space through an attribute-specific content-based image retrieval
case study using the SLICE-3D dataset.

Method: 使用ViT编码器、轻量卷积解码器和线性分类器，通过重构分支将增强信号映射回原始信号，在预训练中学习鲁棒特征，微调时使用部分标签监督

Result: 在RML2018.01A数据集上，低标签情况下优于监督CNN和ViT基线，仅用15-20%标注数据即可达到ResNet水平精度，在不同SNR下保持强性能

Conclusion: 该框架为自动调制识别提供了简单、可泛化且标签高效的解决方案

Abstract: Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is critical for cognitive radio,
spectrum monitoring, and secure wireless communication. However, existing
solutions often rely on large labeled datasets or multi-stage training
pipelines, which limit scalability and generalization in practice. We propose a
unified Vision Transformer (ViT) framework that integrates supervised,
self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives. The model combines a ViT
encoder, a lightweight convolutional decoder, and a linear classifier; the
reconstruction branch maps augmented signals back to their originals, anchoring
the encoder to fine-grained I/Q structure. This strategy promotes robust,
discriminative feature learning during pretraining, while partial label
supervision in fine-tuning enables effective classification with limited
labels. On the RML2018.01A dataset, our approach outperforms supervised CNN and
ViT baselines in low-label regimes, approaches ResNet-level accuracy with only
15-20% labeled data, and maintains strong performance across varying SNR
levels. Overall, the framework provides a simple, generalizable, and
label-efficient solution for AMR.

Conclusion: InfinityHuman通过稳定的姿态引导和手部奖励机制，成功解决了音频驱动人体动画中的关键挑战，为生成高质量长时视频提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation has attracted wide attention thanks to its
practical applications. However, critical challenges remain in generating
high-resolution, long-duration videos with consistent appearance and natural
hand motions. Existing methods extend videos using overlapping motion frames
but suffer from error accumulation, leading to identity drift, color shifts,
and scene instability. Additionally, hand movements are poorly modeled,
resulting in noticeable distortions and misalignment with the audio. In this
work, we propose InfinityHuman, a coarse-to-fine framework that first generates
audio-synchronized representations, then progressively refines them into
high-resolution, long-duration videos using a pose-guided refiner. Since pose
sequences are decoupled from appearance and resist temporal degradation, our
pose-guided refiner employs stable poses and the initial frame as a visual
anchor to reduce drift and improve lip synchronization. Moreover, to enhance
semantic accuracy and gesture realism, we introduce a hand-specific reward
mechanism trained with high-quality hand motion data. Experiments on the EMTD
and HDTF datasets show that InfinityHuman achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video quality, identity preservation, hand accuracy, and lip-sync. Ablation
studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module. Code will be made
public.

Conclusion: 将空间音频线索整合到模型架构中对于准确预测全景视频中的视觉显著性至关重要，音频信息能够有效提升显著性预测性能。

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos (ODVs) are redefining viewer experiences in virtual
reality (VR) by offering an unprecedented full field-of-view (FOV). This study
extends the domain of saliency prediction to 360-degree environments,
addressing the complexities of spherical distortion and the integration of
spatial audio. Contextually, ODVs have transformed user experience by adding a
spatial audio dimension that aligns sound direction with the viewer's
perspective in spherical scenes. Motivated by the lack of comprehensive
datasets for 360-degree audio-visual saliency prediction, our study curates
YT360-EyeTracking, a new dataset of 81 ODVs, each observed under varying
audio-visual conditions. Our goal is to explore how to utilize audio-visual
cues to effectively predict visual saliency in 360-degree videos. Towards this
aim, we propose two novel saliency prediction models: SalViT360, a
vision-transformer-based framework for ODVs equipped with spherical
geometry-aware spatio-temporal attention layers, and SalViT360-AV, which
further incorporates transformer adapters conditioned on audio input. Our
results on a number of benchmark datasets, including our YT360-EyeTracking,
demonstrate that SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV significantly outperform existing
methods in predicting viewer attention in 360-degree scenes. Interpreting these
results, we suggest that integrating spatial audio cues in the model
architecture is crucial for accurate saliency prediction in omnidirectional
videos. Code and dataset will be available at

Abstract: The development of many vision models mainly focuses on improving their
performance using metrics such as accuracy, IoU, and mAP, with less attention
to explainability due to the complexity of applying xAI methods to provide a
meaningful explanation of trained models. Although many existing xAI methods
aim to explain vision models sample-by-sample, methods explaining the general
behavior of vision models, which can only be captured after running on a large
dataset, are still underexplored. Furthermore, understanding the behavior of
vision models on general images can be very important to prevent biased
judgments and help identify the model's trends and patterns. With the
application of Vision-Language Models, this paper proposes a pipeline to
explain vision models at both the sample and dataset levels. The proposed
pipeline can be used to discover failure cases and gain insights into vision
models with minimal effort, thereby integrating vision model development with
xAI analysis to advance image analysis.

Abstract: This study proposes ATMS-KD (Adaptive Temperature and Mixed-Sample Knowledge
Distillation), a novel framework for developing lightweight CNN models suitable
for resource-constrained agricultural environments. The framework combines
adaptive temperature scheduling with mixed-sample augmentation to transfer
knowledge from a MobileNetV3 Large teacher model (5.7\,M parameters) to
lightweight residual CNN students. Three student configurations were evaluated:
Compact (1.3\,M parameters), Standard (2.4\,M parameters), and Enhanced (3.8\,M
parameters). The dataset used in this study consists of images of \textit{Rosa
damascena} (Damask rose) collected from agricultural fields in the Dades Oasis,
southeastern Morocco, providing a realistic benchmark for agricultural computer
vision applications under diverse environmental conditions. Experimental
evaluation on the Damascena rose maturity classification dataset demonstrated
significant improvements over direct training methods. All student models
achieved validation accuracies exceeding 96.7\% with ATMS-KD compared to
95--96\% with direct training. The framework outperformed eleven established
knowledge distillation methods, achieving 97.11\% accuracy with the compact
model -- a 1.60 percentage point improvement over the second-best approach
while maintaining the lowest inference latency of 72.19\,ms. Knowledge
retention rates exceeded 99\% for all configurations, demonstrating effective
knowledge transfer regardless of student model capacity.

Motivation: 解决先进材料制造中快速可靠质量评估的瓶颈问题，特别是针对非传统增材制造产生的异质结构，需要将微观结构信息与专家知识相结合

Method: 开发定制化的混合视觉语言表示(VLRs)，整合深度语义分割与预训练多模态模型(CLIP和FLAVA)，通过包含正负参考的相似性表示和Z-score归一化实现零样本分类

Result: 在增材制造金属基复合材料数据集上验证，能够区分合格和有缺陷的样品，FLAVA模型具有更高的视觉敏感性，CLIP模型与文本标准更一致

Abstract: Rapid and reliable qualification of advanced materials remains a bottleneck
in industrial manufacturing, particularly for heterogeneous structures produced
via non-conventional additive manufacturing processes. This study introduces a
novel framework that links microstructure informatics with a range of expert
characterization knowledge using customized and hybrid vision-language
representations (VLRs). By integrating deep semantic segmentation with
pre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA), we encode both visual
microstructural data and textual expert assessments into shared
representations. To overcome limitations in general-purpose embeddings, we
develop a customized similarity-based representation that incorporates both
positive and negative references from expert-annotated images and their
associated textual descriptions. This allows zero-shot classification of
previously unseen microstructures through a net similarity scoring approach.
Validation on an additively manufactured metal matrix composite dataset
demonstrates the framework's ability to distinguish between acceptable and
defective samples across a range of characterization criteria. Comparative
analysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the
CLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria. Z-score
normalization adjusts raw unimodal and cross-modal similarity scores based on
their local dataset-driven distributions, enabling more effective alignment and
classification in the hybrid vision-language framework. The proposed method
enhances traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines by
enabling human-in-the-loop decision-making without task-specific model
retraining. By advancing semantic interoperability between raw data and expert
knowledge, this work contributes toward scalable and domain-adaptable
qualification strategies in engineering informatics.

TL;DR: 使用MedNeXt-L-k5模型进行自动化软脚空间分割，在T2加权MRI上达到预期性能，但在T1加权MRI和跨数据集上性能下降，未超过nnU-Net。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手工分割软脚空间耗时且可靠性中等，现有自动化深度学习模型性能中等且跨数据集通用性差，需要更好的解决方案。

Method: 适配MedNeXt-L-k5（Transformer受启发的3D编码器-解码器卷积网络）进行自动PVS分割，训练了两个模型：一个使用HCP-Aging数据集的200个T2加权MRI扫描，另一个使用来自六台扫描仪的40个异质T1加权MRI数据。

Result: 在T2加权MRI上达到百分之80的Dice分数，与手工分割可靠性相当，为目前文献最高。在T1加权MRI上性能显著下降（Dice 0.58），跨数据集验证中性能更低（Dice 0.35-0.38）。模型未能超过nnU-Net。

Conclusion: MedNeXt-L-k5提供了一种高效的自动PVS分割方案，但Transformer受启发的全局上下文注意机制并非PVS分割高准确性的必需条件。

Abstract: Enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS) are increasingly recognized as biomarkers
of cerebral small vessel disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and
aging-related neurodegeneration. However, manual segmentation of PVS is
time-consuming and subject to moderate inter-rater reliability, while existing
automated deep learning models have moderate performance and typically fail to
generalize across diverse clinical and research MRI datasets. We adapted
MedNeXt-L-k5, a Transformer-inspired 3D encoder-decoder convolutional network,
for automated PVS segmentation. Two models were trained: one using a
homogeneous dataset of 200 T2-weighted (T2w) MRI scans from the Human
Connectome Project-Aging (HCP-Aging) dataset and another using 40 heterogeneous
T1-weighted (T1w) MRI volumes from seven studies across six scanners. Model
performance was evaluated using internal 5-fold cross validation (5FCV) and
leave-one-site-out cross validation (LOSOCV). MedNeXt-L-k5 models trained on
the T2w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved voxel-level Dice scores of
0.88+/-0.06 (white matter, WM), comparable to the reported inter-rater
reliability of that dataset, and the highest yet reported in the literature.
The same models trained on the T1w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved a
substantially lower Dice score of 0.58+/-0.09 (WM). Under LOSOCV, the model had
voxel-level Dice scores of 0.38+/-0.16 (WM) and 0.35+/-0.12 (BG), and
cluster-level Dice scores of 0.61+/-0.19 (WM) and 0.62+/-0.21 (BG).
MedNeXt-L-k5 provides an efficient solution for automated PVS segmentation
across diverse T1w and T2w MRI datasets. MedNeXt-L-k5 did not outperform the
nnU-Net, indicating that the attention-based mechanisms present in
transformer-inspired models to provide global context are not required for high
accuracy in PVS segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种无需训练的反馈驱动自适应框架，通过将输出层的片形对应关系适应到中间注意力机制，以解决CLIP模型在开政字典分割任务中的定位问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型虽然具有强大的视觉-文本对齐能力，但在开政字典分割任务中因定位能力较差而遇到困难。之前的方法通过修改中间注意力来提升空间一致性，但这种一致性因后续操作而无法一致传播到最终输出，且中间注意力缺乏与文本表征的直接交互。

Method: 设计了一个包含注意力隔离、基于信心度的稀疏适应和适应集成的关键模块，将模型输出作为更强的空间一致性先验知识，通过反馈机制将输出层的片形对应关系适应到中间注意力机制中。

Result: 该方法作为插件模块无缝集成到四种最先进方法中，支持三种核心网络结构（ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H）和多种注意力类型。在八个标准测试集上均实现了性能提升。

Conclusion: 该框架通过将最终预测作为强化空间一致性的反馈信息，有效地提升了内部表征与最终输出之间的语义一致性，为解决CLIP模型在开政字典分割任务中的定位问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: CLIP exhibits strong visual-textual alignment but struggle with
open-vocabulary segmentation due to poor localization. Prior methods enhance
spatial coherence by modifying intermediate attention. But, this coherence
isn't consistently propagated to the final output due to subsequent operations
such as projections. Additionally, intermediate attention lacks direct
interaction with text representations, such semantic discrepancy limits the
full potential of CLIP.
  In this work, we propose a training-free, feedback-driven self-adaptive
framework that adapts output-based patch-level correspondences back to the
intermediate attention. The output predictions, being the culmination of the
model's processing, encapsulate the most comprehensive visual and textual
semantics about each patch. Our approach enhances semantic consistency between
internal representations and final predictions by leveraging the model's
outputs as a stronger spatial coherence prior. We design key modules, including
attention isolation, confidence-based pruning for sparse adaptation, and
adaptation ensemble, to effectively feedback the output coherence cues. Our
method functions as a plug-in module, seamlessly integrating into four
state-of-the-art approaches with three backbones (ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H). We
further validate our framework across multiple attention types (Q-K, self-self,
and Proxy augmented with MAE, SAM, and DINO). Our approach consistently
improves their performance across eight benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个探测框架来系统分析多模态大语言模型处理视觉和文本输入的层级动态，发现MLLMs存在一致的阶段性结构：早期层进行视觉接地，中间层支持词汇整合和语义推理，最终层准备任务特定输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务上表现出色，但其内部处理机制尚未得到充分探索，需要系统分析模型如何处理视觉和文本输入。

Method: 训练线性分类器从每个层级的token嵌入中预测细粒度视觉类别，使用标准化锚点问题，并在三种提示变体下评估：词汇变体、语义否定变体和输出格式变体。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5、LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3和Qwen2-VL上发现一致的阶段性结构，整体结构在视觉标记化、指令调优数据和预训练语料变化下保持稳定，但具体层级分配随基础LLM架构变化而显著调整。

Conclusion: 研究为MLLMs的层级组织提供了统一视角，并提供了轻量级、模型无关的方法来分析多模态表示动态。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet their internal processing
dynamics remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce a probing framework
to systematically analyze how MLLMs process visual and textual inputs across
layers. We train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories
(e.g., dog breeds) from token embeddings extracted at each layer, using a
standardized anchor question. To uncover the functional roles of different
layers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt
variations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level
changes, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by
modifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that
preserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to
LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent
stage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle
layers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers
prepare task-specific outputs. We further show that while the overall
stage-wise structure remains stable across variations in visual tokenization,
instruction tuning data, and pretraining corpus, the specific layer allocation
to each stage shifts notably with changes in the base LLM architecture. Our
findings provide a unified perspective on the layer-wise organization of MLLMs
and offer a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for analyzing multimodal
representation dynamics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种监督字典学习方法SLiCS，通过稀疏线性概念子空间对视觉-语言共嵌入空间进行解耦，将嵌入分解为多个概念特定的分量向量，实现更精确的概念过滤图像检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言共嵌入网络（如CLIP）提供了具有语义信息的潜在嵌入空间，但作者假设可以通过将嵌入分解到不同子空间来分离复杂场景的内容信息，从而实现更好的概念解耦。

Method: 采用监督字典学习方法，估计一个线性合成模型，包含字典中向量组的稀疏非负组合。通过新颖的交替优化算法优化组结构字典，利用文本共嵌入找到语义上有意义的描述，并利用零样本分类提供实例级多标签。

Result: SLiCS提供的解耦嵌入能够实现更精确的概念过滤图像检索（和条件生成）。该方法在TiTok的压缩自编码器嵌入和DINOv2的自监督嵌入上都取得了定量和定性的改进效果。

Conclusion: 稀疏线性概念子空间方法能够有效解耦视觉-语言嵌入空间，提高概念过滤图像检索的精确度，该方法可应用于不同类型的嵌入表示。

Abstract: Vision-language co-embedding networks, such as CLIP, provide a latent
embedding space with semantic information that is useful for downstream tasks.
We hypothesize that the embedding space can be disentangled to separate the
information on the content of complex scenes by decomposing the embedding into
multiple concept-specific component vectors that lie in different subspaces. We
propose a supervised dictionary learning approach to estimate a linear
synthesis model consisting of sparse, non-negative combinations of groups of
vectors in the dictionary (atoms), whose group-wise activity matches the
multi-label information. Each concept-specific component is a non-negative
combination of atoms associated to a label. The group-structured dictionary is
optimized through a novel alternating optimization with guaranteed convergence.
Exploiting the text co-embeddings, we detail how semantically meaningful
descriptions can be found based on text embeddings of words best approximated
by a concept's group of atoms, and unsupervised dictionary learning can exploit
zero-shot classification of training set images using the text embeddings of
concept labels to provide instance-wise multi-labels. We show that the
disentangled embeddings provided by our sparse linear concept subspaces (SLiCS)
enable concept-filtered image retrieval (and conditional generation using
image-to-prompt) that is more precise. We also apply SLiCS to highly-compressed
autoencoder embeddings from TiTok and the latent embedding from self-supervised
DINOv2. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight the improved precision
of the concept-filtered image retrieval for all embeddings.

Abstract: Recent advances in medical vision-language models (VLMs) open up remarkable
opportunities for clinical applications such as automated report generation,
copilots for physicians, and uncertainty quantification. However, despite their
promise, medical VLMs introduce serious security concerns, most notably risks
of Protected Health Information (PHI) exposure, data leakage, and vulnerability
to cyberthreats - which are especially critical in hospital environments. Even
when adopted for research or non-clinical purposes, healthcare organizations
must exercise caution and implement safeguards. To address these challenges, we
present MedFoundationHub, a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit that: (1)
enables physicians to manually select and use different models without
programming expertise, (2) supports engineers in efficiently deploying medical
VLMs in a plug-and-play fashion, with seamless integration of Hugging Face
open-source models, and (3) ensures privacy-preserving inference through
Docker-orchestrated, operating system agnostic deployment. MedFoundationHub
requires only an offline local workstation equipped with a single NVIDIA A6000
GPU, making it both secure and accessible within the typical resources of
academic research labs. To evaluate current capabilities, we engaged
board-certified pathologists to deploy and assess five state-of-the-art VLMs
(Google-MedGemma3-4B, Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, and
LLaVA-1.5-7B/13B). Expert evaluation covered colon cases and renal cases,
yielding 1015 clinician-model scoring events. These assessments revealed
recurring limitations, including off-target answers, vague reasoning, and
inconsistent pathology terminology.

Conclusion: BIM模型通过创新的扫描机制有效解决了多任务密集预测中的交互效率问题，在保持线性复杂度的同时实现了充分的跨任务信息交互

Abstract: Sufficient cross-task interaction is crucial for success in multi-task dense
prediction. However, sufficient interaction often results in high computational
complexity, forcing existing methods to face the trade-off between interaction
completeness and computational efficiency. To address this limitation, this
work proposes a Bidirectional Interaction Mamba (BIM), which incorporates novel
scanning mechanisms to adapt the Mamba modeling approach for multi-task dense
prediction. On the one hand, we introduce a novel Bidirectional Interaction
Scan (BI-Scan) mechanism, which constructs task-specific representations as
bidirectional sequences during interaction. By integrating task-first and
position-first scanning modes within a unified linear complexity architecture,
BI-Scan efficiently preserves critical cross-task information. On the other
hand, we employ a Multi-Scale Scan~(MS-Scan) mechanism to achieve
multi-granularity scene modeling. This design not only meets the diverse
granularity requirements of various tasks but also enhances nuanced cross-task
feature interactions. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks,
\emph{i.e.}, NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context, show the superiority of our BIM vs its
state-of-the-art competitors.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种无需训练的音频导吐视觉编辑方案，有效解决了复杂多模态编辑任务的挑战，拓展了双吐模型在视觉编辑中的应用能力。

Abstract: Visual editing with diffusion models has made significant progress but often
struggles with complex scenarios that textual guidance alone could not
adequately describe, highlighting the need for additional non-text editing
prompts. In this work, we introduce a novel audio-guided visual editing
framework that can handle complex editing tasks with multiple text and audio
prompts without requiring additional training. Existing audio-guided visual
editing methods often necessitate training on specific datasets to align audio
with text, limiting their generalization to real-world situations. We leverage
a pre-trained multi-modal encoder with strong zero-shot capabilities and
integrate diverse audio into visual editing tasks, by alleviating the
discrepancy between the audio encoder space and the diffusion model's prompt
encoder space. Additionally, we propose a novel approach to handle complex
scenarios with multiple and multi-modal editing prompts through our separate
noise branching and adaptive patch selection. Our comprehensive experiments on
diverse editing tasks demonstrate that our framework excels in handling
complicated editing scenarios by incorporating rich information from audio,
where text-only approaches fail.

Conclusion: AEVLP框架通过创新的损失函数和伪标签技术，有效解决了SPML中的噪声和标注不足问题，在多标签分类任务中表现出色

Abstract: Multi-label learning is a challenging computer vision task that requires
assigning multiple categories to each image. However, fully annotating
large-scale datasets is often impractical due to high costs and effort,
motivating the study of learning from partially annotated data. In the extreme
case of Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPML), each image is provided
with only one positive label, while all other labels remain unannotated.
Traditional SPML methods that treat missing labels as unknown or negative tend
to yield inaccuracies and false negatives, and integrating various
pseudo-labeling strategies can introduce additional noise. To address these
challenges, we propose the Generalized Pseudo-Label Robust Loss (GPR Loss), a
novel loss function that effectively learns from diverse pseudo-labels while
mitigating noise. Complementing this, we introduce a simple yet effective
Dynamic Augmented Multi-focus Pseudo-labeling (DAMP) technique. Together, these
contributions form the Adaptive and Efficient Vision-Language Pseudo-Labeling
(AEVLP) framework. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our framework significantly advances multi-label classification, achieving
state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the brain, are characterized by
minimal power consumption and swift inference capabilities on neuromorphic
hardware, and have been widely applied to various visual perception tasks.
Current ANN-SNN conversion methods have achieved excellent results in
classification tasks with ultra-low time-steps, but their performance in visual
detection tasks remains suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a delay-spike
approach to mitigate the issue of residual membrane potential caused by
heterogeneous spiking patterns. Furthermore, we propose a novel
temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron architecture for SNNs. This
enables Integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons to dynamically adjust their
accumulation and firing behaviors based on the temporal order of time-steps.
Our method enables spikes to exhibit distinct temporal properties, rather than
relying solely on frequency-based representations. Moreover, the tdIF neuron
maintains energy consumption on par with traditional IF neuron. We demonstrate
that our method achieves more precise feature representation with lower
time-steps, enabling high performance and ultra-low latency in visual detection
tasks. In this study, we conduct extensive evaluation of the tdIF method across
two critical vision tasks: object detection and lane line detection. The
results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses current ANN-SNN
conversion approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance with ultra-low
latency (within 5 time-steps).

<details>

Motivation: 现有显著目标检测方法在复杂场景中容易丢失细节、边缘模糊，且单模态信息融合不足，需要提升小结构和边缘区域的检测精度。

Method: 设计动态不确定性图卷积模块(DUGC)通过空间语义距离构建稀疏图传播不确定性；提出多模态协同融合策略(MCF)使用可学习门控权重融合RGB、深度和边缘特征的注意力图；采用多尺度BCE和IoU损失、跨尺度一致性约束和不确定性引导监督机制优化检测性能。

Conclusion: DUP-MCRNet通过动态不确定性传播和多模态协同融合有效提升了显著目标检测的性能，特别是在细节保持和边缘清晰度方面有显著改进。

Abstract: In view of the problems that existing salient object detection (SOD) methods
are prone to losing details, blurring edges, and insufficient fusion of
single-modal information in complex scenes, this paper proposes a dynamic
uncertainty propagation and multimodal collaborative reasoning network
(DUP-MCRNet). Firstly, a dynamic uncertainty graph convolution module (DUGC) is
designed to propagate uncertainty between layers through a sparse graph
constructed based on spatial semantic distance, and combined with channel
adaptive interaction, it effectively improves the detection accuracy of small
structures and edge regions. Secondly, a multimodal collaborative fusion
strategy (MCF) is proposed, which uses learnable modality gating weights to
weightedly fuse the attention maps of RGB, depth, and edge features. It can
dynamically adjust the importance of each modality according to different
scenes, effectively suppress redundant or interfering information, and
strengthen the semantic complementarity and consistency between
cross-modalities, thereby improving the ability to identify salient regions
under occlusion, weak texture or background interference. Finally, the
detection performance at the pixel level and region level is optimized through
multi-scale BCE and IoU loss, cross-scale consistency constraints, and
uncertainty-guided supervision mechanisms. Extensive experiments show that
DUP-MCRNet outperforms various SOD methods on most common benchmark datasets,
especially in terms of edge clarity and robustness to complex backgrounds. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/YukiBear426/DUP-MCRNet.

TL;DR: 提出MSMVD方法，通过多尺度图像特征生成多尺度BEV特征，解决多视角行人检测中尺度不一致的问题，在GMVD数据集上MODA指标提升4.5个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的端到端深度学习方法在多视角行人检测中，难以处理视角内尺度一致偏小或偏大，以及视角间尺度差异巨大的行人检测问题，因为它们没有充分利用多尺度图像特征。

Method: MSMVD方法从各个视角提取多尺度图像特征，逐尺度投影到BEV空间生成多尺度BEV特征，然后使用特征金字塔网络处理这些特征来融合不同尺度的多视角信息。

Result: 通过多尺度BEV特征利用多尺度图像特征，显著提升了检测性能，在GMVD数据集上MODA指标比之前最佳方法提高了4.5个点。

Conclusion: 利用多尺度图像特征生成多尺度BEV特征的方法有效解决了多视角行人检测中的尺度不一致问题，大幅提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Detection (MVPD) aims to detect pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view (BEV) from multi-view images. In MVPD, end-to-end
trainable deep learning methods have progressed greatly. However, they often
struggle to detect pedestrians with consistently small or large scales in views
or with vastly different scales between views. This is because they do not
exploit multi-scale image features to generate the BEV feature and detect
pedestrians. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel MVPD method, called
Multi-Scale Multi-View Detection (MSMVD). MSMVD generates multi-scale BEV
features by projecting multi-scale image features extracted from individual
views into the BEV space, scale-by-scale. Each of these BEV features inherits
the properties of its corresponding scale image features from multiple views.
Therefore, these BEV features help the precise detection of pedestrians with
consistently small or large scales in views. Then, MSMVD combines information
at different scales of multiple views by processing the multi-scale BEV
features using a feature pyramid network. This improves the detection of
pedestrians with vastly different scales between views. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that exploiting multi-scale image features via multi-scale BEV
features greatly improves the detection performance, and MSMVD outperforms the
previous highest MODA by $4.5$ points on the GMVD dataset.

TL;DR: 提出轻量级实时深度伪造检测网络SFMFNet，通过空间-频率混合感知模块和多尺度特征融合，在保持高精度的同时显著降低计算成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度伪造检测器虽然准确率高但计算成本过大，难以满足实时应用需求，需要开发轻量高效的检测方案

Method: 设计空间-频率混合感知模块（结合空间纹理和频率伪影）、令牌选择性交叉注意力机制、残差增强模糊池化结构

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现了准确率与效率的良好平衡，具有强泛化能力和实际应用价值

Conclusion: SFMFNet为实时深度伪造检测提供了有效的轻量级解决方案，在准确性和效率之间取得了优越的平衡

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of real-time deepfake generation techniques,
forged content is becoming increasingly realistic and widespread across
applications like video conferencing and social media. Although
state-of-the-art detectors achieve high accuracy on standard benchmarks, their
heavy computational cost hinders real-time deployment in practical
applications. To address this, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Aware
Multi-Scale Fusion Network (SFMFNet), a lightweight yet effective architecture
for real-time deepfake detection. We design a spatial-frequency hybrid aware
module that jointly leverages spatial textures and frequency artifacts through
a gated mechanism, enhancing sensitivity to subtle manipulations. A
token-selective cross attention mechanism enables efficient multi-level feature
interaction, while a residual-enhanced blur pooling structure helps retain key
semantic cues during downsampling. Experiments on several benchmark datasets
show that SFMFNet achieves a favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency,
with strong generalization and practical value for real-time applications.

Conclusion: 通过结合双模型权重选择与自我知识萌芬，该方法克服了传统方法在缩减模型时丢失关键信息的问题

Abstract: We propose a novel medical image classification method that integrates
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation (SKD). In
real-world medical settings, deploying large-scale models is often limited by
computational resource constraints, which pose significant challenges for their
practical implementation. Thus, developing lightweight models that achieve
comparable performance to large-scale models while maintaining computational
efficiency is crucial. To address this, we employ a dual-model weight selection
strategy that initializes two lightweight models with weights derived from a
large pretrained model, enabling effective knowledge transfer. Next, SKD is
applied to these selected models, allowing the use of a broad range of initial
weight configurations without imposing additional excessive computational cost,
followed by fine-tuning for the target classification tasks. By combining
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation, our method
overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches, which often fail to
retain critical information in compact models. Extensive experiments on
publicly available datasets-chest X-ray images, lung computed tomography scans,
and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans-demonstrate the superior performance
and robustness of our approach compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种高效的LiDAR点云压缩方法，通过几何重密化和跨尺度特征传播模块，实现了高压缩比和实时性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高精度LiDAR扫描导致存储和传输开销过大，现有方法在极端稀疏的几何细节上上下文建模效率低，限制了压缩性能和速度。

Method: 提出了两个轻量模块：几何重密化模块通过重密化编码后的稀疏几何来提取更密集的特征，然后重新稀疏化进行预测编码；跨尺度特征传播模块利用多分辨率占位线索来指导层次特征传播。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上达到了最先进的压缩比和实时性能，在12位量化下实现了编码和解码都达到26 FPS。

Conclusion: 通过集成这两个模块，该方法生成了简洁的特征表示，提供了高效的上下文建模并加速了编码过程。

Abstract: LiDAR point clouds are fundamental to various applications, yet
high-precision scans incur substantial storage and transmission overhead.
Existing methods typically convert unordered points into hierarchical octree or
voxel structures for dense-to-sparse predictive coding. However, the extreme
sparsity of geometric details hinders efficient context modeling, thereby
limiting their compression performance and speed. To address this challenge, we
propose to generate compact features for efficient predictive coding. Our
framework comprises two lightweight modules. First, the Geometry
Re-Densification Module re-densifies encoded sparse geometry, extracts features
at denser scale, and then re-sparsifies the features for predictive coding.
This module avoids costly computation on highly sparse details while
maintaining a lightweight prediction head. Second, the Cross-scale Feature
Propagation Module leverages occupancy cues from multiple resolution levels to
guide hierarchical feature propagation. This design facilitates information
sharing across scales, thereby reducing redundant feature extraction and
providing enriched features for the Geometry Re-Densification Module. By
integrating these two modules, our method yields a compact feature
representation that provides efficient context modeling and accelerates the
coding process. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art
compression ratios and real-time performance, achieving 26 FPS for both
encoding and decoding at 12-bit quantization. Code is available at

Abstract: Scaling laws have validated the success and promise of large-data-trained
models in creative generation across text, image, and video domains. However,
this paradigm faces data scarcity in the 3D domain, as there is far less of it
available on the internet compared to the aforementioned modalities.
Fortunately, there exist adequate videos that inherently contain commonsense
priors, offering an alternative supervisory signal to mitigate the
generalization bottleneck caused by limited native 3D data. On the one hand,
videos capturing multiple views of an object or scene provide a spatial
consistency prior for 3D generation. On the other hand, the rich semantic
information contained within the videos enables the generated content to be
more faithful to the text prompts and semantically plausible. This paper
explores how to apply the video modality in 3D asset generation, spanning
datasets to models. We introduce Droplet3D-4M, the first large-scale video
dataset with multi-view level annotations, and train Droplet3D, a generative
model supporting both image and dense text input. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to
produce spatially consistent and semantically plausible content. Moreover, in
contrast to the prevailing 3D solutions, our approach exhibits the potential
for extension to scene-level applications. This indicates that the commonsense
priors from the videos significantly facilitate 3D creation. We have
open-sourced all resources including the dataset, code, technical framework,
and model weights: https://dropletx.github.io/.

Conclusion: G^2Editor为解决驾驶视频中物体编辑的视觉保真度和姿态控制问题提供了有效的解决方案，为自动驾驶系统的训练和验证提供了高质量的合成数据生成能力。

Abstract: Corner cases are crucial for training and validating autonomous driving
systems, yet collecting them from the real world is often costly and hazardous.
Editing objects within captured sensor data offers an effective alternative for
generating diverse scenarios, commonly achieved through 3D Gaussian Splatting
or image generative models. However, these approaches often suffer from limited
visual fidelity or imprecise pose control. To address these issues, we propose
G^2Editor, a framework designed for photorealistic and precise object editing
in driving videos. Our method leverages a 3D Gaussian representation of the
edited object as a dense prior, injected into the denoising process to ensure
accurate pose control and spatial consistency. A scene-level 3D bounding box
layout is employed to reconstruct occluded areas of non-target objects.
Furthermore, to guide the appearance details of the edited object, we
incorporate hierarchical fine-grained features as additional conditions during
generation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that G^2Editor
effectively supports object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within a
unified framework, outperforming existing methods in both pose controllability
and visual quality, while also benefiting downstream data-driven tasks.

Conclusion: 将领域特定的解剖先验知识整合到合成数据流程中，可有效缓解数据稀缺问题，提高对稀有但临床重要疾病的分析能力

Abstract: Accurate fetal brain segmentation is crucial for extracting biomarkers and
assessing neurodevelopment, especially in conditions such as corpus callosum
dysgenesis (CCD), which can induce drastic anatomical changes. However, the
rarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of
deep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain
randomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a
synthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations
from healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without
requiring pathological annotations.
  We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with
CCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on
CCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with
other pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically
relevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show
their utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed
augmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in
healthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Beyond these
quantitative gains, our approach yields segmentations with improved topological
consistency relative to available ground truth, enabling more reliable
shape-based analyses. Overall, this work demonstrates that incorporating
domain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can effectively
mitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant
malformations.

Motivation: 传统语音识别系统对聋哑人士不可用，而现有的视觉替代方案（手语和唇语识别）多被孤立研究，缺乏统一框架来整合这些模态并探索它们之间的协同作用。

Method: 设计了一个统一的模态无关架构，能够有效处理异构输入，特别关注唇部运动作为手语理解中的非手动线索的作用。

Result: 在SLT、VSR、ASR和AVSR等多个任务上达到或超越了专门模型的最先进性能，且发现显式建模唇部运动能显著提升手语翻译性能。

Conclusion: 该统一框架成功整合了多种通信模态，证明了跨模态协同的重要性，特别是唇部运动在手语理解中的关键作用，为无障碍通信技术提供了新方向。

Abstract: Audio is the primary modality for human communication and has driven the
success of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies. However, such
systems remain inherently inaccessible to individuals who are deaf or hard of
hearing. Visual alternatives such as sign language and lip reading offer
effective substitutes, and recent advances in Sign Language Translation (SLT)
and Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) have improved audio-less communication.
Yet, these modalities have largely been studied in isolation, and their
integration within a unified framework remains underexplored. In this paper, we
introduce the first unified framework capable of handling diverse combinations
of sign language, lip movements, and audio for spoken-language text generation.
We focus on three main objectives: (i) designing a unified, modality-agnostic
architecture capable of effectively processing heterogeneous inputs; (ii)
exploring the underexamined synergy among modalities, particularly the role of
lip movements as non-manual cues in sign language comprehension; and (iii)
achieving performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art models
specialized for individual tasks. Building on this framework, we achieve
performance on par with or better than task-specific state-of-the-art models
across SLT, VSR, ASR, and AVSR. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that
explicitly modeling lip movements as a separate modality significantly improves
SLT performance.

Motivation: 现有长视频理解方法依赖静态推理或外部视觉语言模型，存在复杂度高和端到端训练不足导致的性能不佳问题。

Method: 提出多轮推理框架，迭代选择视频片段并基于先前处理片段的理解进行渐进式推理；引入门控双级奖励系统（轨迹级和轮级奖励）优化视频片段选择和问题理解。

Conclusion: Video-MTR通过多轮推理和双级奖励系统，无需外部视觉语言模型即可实现端到端训练，显著提升了长视频理解的性能。

Abstract: Long-form video understanding, characterized by long-range temporal
dependencies and multiple events, remains a challenge. Existing methods often
rely on static reasoning or external visual-language models (VLMs), which face
issues like complexity and sub-optimal performance due to the lack of
end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose Video-MTR, a reinforced
multi-turn reasoning framework designed to enable iterative key video segment
selection and question comprehension. Unlike traditional video reasoning
pipeline, which generate predictions in a single turn, Video-MTR performs
reasoning in multiple turns, selecting video segments progressively based on
the evolving understanding of previously processed segments and the current
question. This iterative process allows for a more refined and contextually
aware analysis of the video. To ensure intermediate reasoning process, we
introduce a novel gated bi-level reward system, combining trajectory-level
rewards based on answer correctness and turn-level rewards emphasizing
frame-query relevance. This system optimizes both video segment selection and
question comprehension, eliminating the need for external VLMs and allowing
end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like VideoMME, MLVU,
and EgoSchema demonstrate that Video-MTR outperforms existing methods in both
accuracy and efficiency, advancing the state-of-the-art in long video
understanding.

Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法未能解决单目3D目标检测中固有的双重不确定性（语义不确定性和几何不确定性），导致在真实世界域偏移下性能下降。

Method: 提出双重不确定性优化框架：1）通过凸优化视角推导无监督焦点损失，实现标签无关的不确定性加权；2）设计语义感知法向场约束，保持几何一致性；3）建立语义-几何互补的双分支机制。

Result: 在多个数据集和域偏移类型上的广泛实验表明，DUO显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DUO通过联合优化语义和几何不确定性，有效提升了单目3D目标检测在域偏移下的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) is pivotal for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, yet its reliability deteriorates
significantly under real-world domain shifts caused by environmental or sensor
variations. To address these shifts, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods have
emerged, enabling models to adapt to target distributions during inference.
While prior TTA approaches recognize the positive correlation between low
uncertainty and high generalization ability, they fail to address the dual
uncertainty inherent to M3OD: semantic uncertainty (ambiguous class
predictions) and geometric uncertainty (unstable spatial localization). To
bridge this gap, we propose Dual Uncertainty Optimization (DUO), the first TTA
framework designed to jointly minimize both uncertainties for robust M3OD.
Through a convex optimization lens, we introduce an innovative convex structure
of the focal loss and further derive a novel unsupervised version, enabling
label-agnostic uncertainty weighting and balanced learning for high-uncertainty
objects. In parallel, we design a semantic-aware normal field constraint that
preserves geometric coherence in regions with clear semantic cues, reducing
uncertainty from the unstable 3D representation. This dual-branch mechanism
forms a complementary loop: enhanced spatial perception improves semantic
classification, and robust semantic predictions further refine spatial
understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DUO over
existing methods across various datasets and domain shift types.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to more studies to enhance golfers'
shot precision. However, these existing studies have not quantitatively
established the relationship between swing posture and ball trajectory,
limiting their ability to provide golfers with the necessary insights for swing
improvement. In this paper, we propose a new dataset called CaddieSet, which
includes joint information and various ball information from a single shot.
CaddieSet extracts joint information from a single swing video by segmenting it
into eight swing phases using a computer vision-based approach. Furthermore,
based on expert golf domain knowledge, we define 15 key metrics that influence
a golf swing, enabling the interpretation of swing outcomes through
swing-related features. Through experiments, we demonstrated the feasibility of
CaddieSet for predicting ball trajectories using various benchmarks. In
particular, we focus on interpretable models among several benchmarks and
verify that swing feedback using our joint features is quantitatively
consistent with established domain knowledge. This work is expected to offer
new insight into golf swing analysis for both academia and the sports industry.

Conclusion: IAENet通过有效整合2D和3D专家知识，提升了3D表面异常检测性能，具有工业部署的实用价值。

Abstract: Surface anomaly detection is pivotal for ensuring product quality in
industrial manufacturing. While 2D image-based methods have achieved remarkable
success, 3D point cloud-based detection remains underexplored despite its
richer geometric cues. We argue that the key bottleneck is the absence of
powerful pretrained foundation backbones in 3D comparable to those in 2D. To
bridge this gap, we propose Importance-Aware Ensemble Network (IAENet), an
ensemble framework that synergizes 2D pretrained expert with 3D expert models.
However, naively fusing predictions from disparate sources is non-trivial:
existing strategies can be affected by a poorly performing modality and thus
degrade overall accuracy. To address this challenge, We introduce an novel
Importance-Aware Fusion (IAF) module that dynamically assesses the contribution
of each source and reweights their anomaly scores. Furthermore, we devise
critical loss functions that explicitly guide the optimization of IAF, enabling
it to combine the collective knowledge of the source experts but also preserve
their unique strengths, thereby enhancing the overall performance of anomaly
detection. Extensive experiments on MVTec 3D-AD demonstrate that our IAENet
achieves a new state-of-the-art with a markedly lower false positive rate,
underscoring its practical value for industrial deployment.

Conclusion: DescriptiveEdit框架克服了指令数据集质量限制，具有更好的可扩展性，为语义图像编辑提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the progress in text-to-image generation, semantic image editing
remains a challenge. Inversion-based algorithms unavoidably introduce
reconstruction errors, while instruction-based models mainly suffer from
limited dataset quality and scale. To address these problems, we propose a
descriptive-prompt-based editing framework, named DescriptiveEdit. The core
idea is to re-frame `instruction-based image editing' as `reference-image-based
text-to-image generation', which preserves the generative power of well-trained
Text-to-Image models without architectural modifications or inversion.
Specifically, taking the reference image and a prompt as input, we introduce a
Cross-Attentive UNet, which newly adds attention bridges to inject reference
image features into the prompt-to-edit-image generation process. Owing to its
text-to-image nature, DescriptiveEdit overcomes limitations in instruction
dataset quality, integrates seamlessly with ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and other
extensions, and is more scalable. Experiments on the Emu Edit benchmark show it
improves editing accuracy and consistency.

Abstract: Continual test-time adaptation aims to continuously adapt a pre-trained model
to a stream of target domain data without accessing source data. Without access
to source domain data, the model focuses solely on the feature characteristics
of the target data. Relying exclusively on these features can lead to confusion
and introduce learning biases. Currently, many existing methods generate
pseudo-labels via model predictions. However, the quality of pseudo-labels
cannot be guaranteed and the problem of error accumulation must be solved. To
address these challenges, we propose DCFS, a novel CTTA framework that
introduces dual-path feature consistency and confidence-aware sample learning.
This framework disentangles the whole feature representation of the target data
into semantic-related feature and domain-related feature using dual classifiers
to learn distinct feature representations. By maintaining consistency between
the sub-features and the whole feature, the model can comprehensively capture
data features from multiple perspectives. Additionally, to ensure that the
whole feature information of the target domain samples is not overlooked, we
set a adaptive threshold and calculate a confidence score for each sample to
carry out loss weighted self-supervised learning, effectively reducing the
noise of pseudo-labels and alleviating the problem of error accumulation. The
efficacy of our proposed method is validated through extensive experimentation
across various datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C,
demonstrating consistent performance in continual test-time adaptation
scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用3DGS模型通过反向传播新视角颜色损失来微调相机标定，在3DGS参考数据集上平均提升0.4 dB PSNR


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机标定质量对新颖视角合成至关重要，1像素的标定误差会对重建质量产生显著影响，而真实场景缺乏标定真值

Method: 使用3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)模型，通过反向传播新视角颜色损失来优化相机参数，实现标定微调

Result: 在3DGS参考数据集上，新的标定方法平均带来0.4 dB PSNR的提升

Conclusion: 虽然微调过程可能耗时，但对于参考场景（如Mip-NeRF 360）的标定，新视角质量的重要性最为关键

Abstract: The quality of the camera calibration is of major importance for evaluating
progresses in novel view synthesis, as a 1-pixel error on the calibration has a
significant impact on the reconstruction quality. While there is no ground
truth for real scenes, the quality of the calibration is assessed by the
quality of the novel view synthesis. This paper proposes to use a 3DGS model to
fine tune calibration by backpropagation of novel view color loss with respect
to the cameras parameters. The new calibration alone brings an average
improvement of 0.4 dB PSNR on the dataset used as reference by 3DGS. The fine
tuning may be long and its suitability depends on the criticity of training
time, but for calibration of reference scenes, such as Mip-NeRF 360, the stake
of novel view quality is the most important.

Abstract: Accurate gross tumor volume segmentation on multi-modal medical data is
critical for radiotherapy planning in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and
glioblastoma. Recent advances in deep neural networks have brought promising
results in medical image segmentation, leading to an increasing demand for
labeled data. Since labeling medical images is time-consuming and
labor-intensive, active learning has emerged as a solution to reduce annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples to label and adapting
high-performance models with as few labeled samples as possible. Previous
active domain adaptation (ADA) methods seek to minimize sample redundancy by
selecting samples that are farthest from the source domain. However, such
one-off selection can easily cause negative transfer, and access to source
medical data is often limited. Moreover, the query strategy for multi-modal
medical data remains unexplored. In this work, we propose an active and
sequential domain adaptation framework for dynamic multi-modal sample selection
in ADA. We derive a query strategy to prioritize labeling and training on the
most valuable samples based on their informativeness and representativeness.
Empirical validation on diverse gross tumor volume segmentation tasks
demonstrates that our method achieves favorable segmentation performance,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art ADA methods. Code is available at

Motivation: 解决现有LiDAR基于3D物体检测需要大量人工标注的问题，以及现有无监督方法简单融合伪框而忽视了多模态数据的补充性。

Method: 提出数据级融合框架，使用视觉基础模型进行实例分割和深度估计，通过双向融合策略（真实点获取类别标签，2D像素投影到3D），采用局部和全局筛波方法减少噪声，并实现数据级融合的动态自我迭代精炼策略。

Conclusion: 通过早期数据级融合和动态自我迭代策略，本方法能够有效提升无监督3D物体检测的性能，为解决高质量3D标签获取困难提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Existing LiDAR-based 3D object detectors typically rely on manually annotated
labels for training to achieve good performance. However, obtaining
high-quality 3D labels is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this
issue, recent works explore unsupervised 3D object detection by introducing RGB
images as an auxiliary modal to assist pseudo-box generation. However, these
methods simply integrate pseudo-boxes generated by LiDAR point clouds and RGB
images. Yet, such a label-level fusion strategy brings limited improvements to
the quality of pseudo-boxes, as it overlooks the complementary nature in terms
of LiDAR and RGB image data. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a
novel data-level fusion framework that integrates RGB images and LiDAR data at
an early stage. Specifically, we utilize vision foundation models for instance
segmentation and depth estimation on images and introduce a bi-directional
fusion method, where real points acquire category labels from the 2D space,
while 2D pixels are projected onto 3D to enhance real point density. To
mitigate noise from depth and segmentation estimations, we propose a local and
global filtering method, which applies local radius filtering to suppress depth
estimation errors and global statistical filtering to remove
segmentation-induced outliers. Furthermore, we propose a data-level fusion
based dynamic self-evolution strategy, which iteratively refines pseudo-boxes
under a dense representation, significantly improving localization accuracy.
Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the detector
trained by our method significantly outperforms that trained by previous
state-of-the-art methods with 28.4$\%$ mAP on the nuScenes validation
benchmark.

Abstract: Estimating Body Mass Index (BMI) from camera images with machine learning
models enables rapid weight assessment when traditional methods are unavailable
or impractical, such as in telehealth or emergency scenarios. Existing computer
vision approaches have been limited to datasets of up to 14,500 images. In this
study, we present a deep learning-based BMI estimation method trained on our
WayBED dataset, a large proprietary collection of 84,963 smartphone images from
25,353 individuals. We introduce an automatic filtering method that uses
posture clustering and person detection to curate the dataset by removing
low-quality images, such as those with atypical postures or incomplete views.
This process retained 71,322 high-quality images suitable for training. We
achieve a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 7.9% on our hold-out test
set (WayBED data) using full-body images, the lowest value in the published
literature to the best of our knowledge. Further, we achieve a MAPE of 13% on
the completely unseen~(during training) VisualBodyToBMI dataset, comparable
with state-of-the-art approaches trained on it, demonstrating robust
generalization. Lastly, we fine-tune our model on VisualBodyToBMI and achieve a
MAPE of 8.56%, the lowest reported value on this dataset so far. We deploy the
full pipeline, including image filtering and BMI estimation, on Android devices
using the CLAID framework. We release our complete code for model training,
filtering, and the CLAID package for mobile deployment as open-source

Motivation: 域适应技术可以缓解训练集和测试集之间的分布差异，但现有研究多基于自然图像而非医学数据，且主流数据集可能导致性能偏差。为了更好地理解域适应技术在自然和医学图像中的效益。

Method: 使用7种广泛使用的域适应技术，在5个自然图像数据集和8个医学图像数据集上进行557个模拟实验，涵盖分布外、动态数据流和有限训练样本等多种场景。

Result: DSAN算法表现突出，在COVID-19数据集上使用Resnet50达到91.2%的分类准确率，在动态数据流场景中相比基线提升6.7%。DSAN在COVID-19和皮肤癌数据集上展现出显著的可解释性。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于理解域适应技术，并为模型在医学数据上的有效适应提供了宝贵见解，DSAN算法在医学图像分类中具有优异性能和实用价值。

Abstract: Domain adaptation (DA) techniques have the potential in machine learning to
alleviate distribution differences between training and test sets by leveraging
information from source domains. In image classification, most advances in DA
have been made using natural images rather than medical data, which are harder
to work with. Moreover, even for natural images, the use of mainstream datasets
can lead to performance bias. {With the aim of better understanding the
benefits of DA for both natural and medical images, this study performs 557
simulation studies using seven widely-used DA techniques for image
classification in five natural and eight medical datasets that cover various
scenarios, such as out-of-distribution, dynamic data streams, and limited
training samples.} Our experiments yield detailed results and insightful
observations highlighting the performance and medical applicability of these
techniques. Notably, our results have shown the outstanding performance of the
Deep Subdomain Adaptation Network (DSAN) algorithm. This algorithm achieved
feasible classification accuracy (91.2\%) in the COVID-19 dataset using
Resnet50 and showed an important accuracy improvement in the dynamic data
stream DA scenario (+6.7\%) compared to the baseline. Our results also
demonstrate that DSAN exhibits remarkable level of explainability when
evaluated on COVID-19 and skin cancer datasets. These results contribute to the
understanding of DA techniques and offer valuable insight into the effective
adaptation of models to medical data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频目标检测面临运动模糊、遮挡等图像退化问题，现有方法通常需要特征聚合和复杂后处理，但计算成本较高。需要在不增加推理负担的情况下提升对图像退化的鲁棒性

Method: 1) 使用对比损失实现对比学习辅助分支，增强主干网络特征表示能力；2) 提出动态损失权重策略，训练早期侧重辅助特征学习，后期逐渐侧重检测任务

Result: 在ImageNet VID数据集上，ResNet-101达到84.0% mAP，ResNeXt-101达到85.2% mAP，实现了CNN模型的最优性能，且无需额外后处理方法

Conclusion: CLAB方法简单有效，通过对比学习和动态权重策略显著提升了视频目标检测性能，在保持推理效率的同时达到了state-of-the-art水平

Abstract: Video object detection is a challenging task because videos often suffer from
image deterioration such as motion blur, occlusion, and deformable shapes,
making it significantly more difficult than detecting objects in still images.
Prior approaches have improved video object detection performance by employing
feature aggregation and complex post-processing techniques, though at the cost
of increased computational demands. To improve robustness to image degradation
without additional computational load during inference, we introduce a
straightforward yet effective Contrastive Learning through Auxiliary Branch
(CLAB) method. First, we implement a constrastive auxiliary branch using a
contrastive loss to enhance the feature representation capability of the video
object detector's backbone. Next, we propose a dynamic loss weighting strategy
that emphasizes auxiliary feature learning early in training while gradually
prioritizing the detection task as training converges. We validate our approach
through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating
consistent performance gains. Without bells and whistles, CLAB reaches a
performance of 84.0% mAP and 85.2% mAP with ResNet-101 and ResNeXt-101,
respectively, on the ImageNet VID dataset, thus achieving state-of-the-art
performance for CNN-based models without requiring additional post-processing
methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 排版攻击通过向图像中注入文本来操纵多模态系统，导致目标错误分类、恶意内容生成和视觉语言模型越狱。需要研究CLIP模型在此类攻击下的行为并开发有效防御方法。

Method: 定位CLIP模型后半层中专用于提取和传输排版信息的注意力头，构建排版电路，通过选择性消融这些注意力头来防御排版攻击，无需微调。

Result: 该方法在排版版ImageNet-100上性能提升达19.6%，标准ImageNet-100准确率下降小于1%。无需训练的方法与依赖微调的最先进防御方法竞争力相当。

Conclusion: 发布了一系列对排版攻击更具鲁棒性的dyslexic CLIP模型，可作为安全关键应用中的直接替代方案，在文本识别效用与文本操纵风险之间取得更好平衡。

Abstract: Typographic attacks exploit multi-modal systems by injecting text into
images, leading to targeted misclassifications, malicious content generation
and even Vision-Language Model jailbreaks. In this work, we analyze how CLIP
vision encoders behave under typographic attacks, locating specialized
attention heads in the latter half of the model's layers that causally extract
and transmit typographic information to the cls token. Building on these
insights, we introduce a method to defend CLIP models against typographic
attacks by selectively ablating a typographic circuit, consisting of attention
heads. Without requiring finetuning, our method improves performance by up to
19.6% on a typographic variant of ImageNet-100, while reducing standard
ImageNet-100 accuracy by less than 1%. Notably, our training-free approach
remains competitive with current state-of-the-art typographic defenses that
rely on finetuning. To this end, we release a family of dyslexic CLIP models
which are significantly more robust against typographic attacks. These models
serve as suitable drop-in replacements for a broad range of safety-critical
applications, where the risks of text-based manipulation outweigh the utility
of text recognition.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) is a crucial task in computer vision with
wide range of applications including human computer interaction, surveillance,
and assistive technologies. However, challenges such as occlusion, expression
variability, and lack of interpretability hinder the performance of traditional
FER systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful alternative by
modeling relational dependencies between facial landmarks, enabling structured
and interpretable learning. In this paper, we propose GLaRE, a novel
Graph-based Landmark Region Embedding network for emotion recognition. Facial
landmarks are extracted using 3D facial alignment, and a quotient graph is
constructed via hierarchical coarsening to preserve spatial structure while
reducing complexity. Our method achieves 64.89 percentage accuracy on AffectNet
and 94.24 percentage on FERG, outperforming several existing baselines.
Additionally, ablation studies have demonstrated that region-level embeddings
from quotient graphs have contributed to improved prediction performance.

Conclusion: FastFit通过创新的缓存架构解决了多参考虚拟试穿的效率和性能瓶颈，为复杂多参考虚拟试穿研究提供了新的解决方案和数据集支持

Abstract: Despite its great potential, virtual try-on technology is hindered from
real-world application by two major challenges: the inability of current
methods to support multi-reference outfit compositions (including garments and
accessories), and their significant inefficiency caused by the redundant
re-computation of reference features in each denoising step. To address these
challenges, we propose FastFit, a high-speed multi-reference virtual try-on
framework based on a novel cacheable diffusion architecture. By employing a
Semi-Attention mechanism and substituting traditional timestep embeddings with
class embeddings for reference items, our model fully decouples reference
feature encoding from the denoising process with negligible parameter overhead.
This allows reference features to be computed only once and losslessly reused
across all steps, fundamentally breaking the efficiency bottleneck and
achieving an average 3.5x speedup over comparable methods. Furthermore, to
facilitate research on complex, multi-reference virtual try-on, we introduce
DressCode-MR, a new large-scale dataset. It comprises 28,179 sets of
high-quality, paired images covering five key categories (tops, bottoms,
dresses, shoes, and bags), constructed through a pipeline of expert models and
human feedback refinement. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD, DressCode,
and our DressCode-MR datasets show that FastFit surpasses state-of-the-art
methods on key fidelity metrics while offering its significant advantage in
inference efficiency.

Abstract: The thermal camera excels at perceiving outdoor environments under low-light
conditions, making it ideal for applications such as nighttime autonomous
driving and unmanned navigation. However, thermal cameras encounter challenges
when capturing signage from objects made of similar materials, which can pose
safety risks for accurately understanding semantics in autonomous driving
systems. In contrast, the neuromorphic vision camera, also known as an event
camera, detects changes in light intensity asynchronously and has proven
effective in high-speed, low-light traffic environments. Recognizing the
complementary characteristics of these two modalities, this paper proposes
UTA-Sign, an unsupervised thermal-event video augmentation for traffic signage
in low-illumination environments, targeting elements such as license plates and
roadblock indicators. To address the signage blind spots of thermal imaging and
the non-uniform sampling of event cameras, we developed a dual-boosting
mechanism that fuses thermal frames and event signals for consistent signage
representation over time. The proposed method utilizes thermal frames to
provide accurate motion cues as temporal references for aligning the uneven
event signals. At the same time, event signals contribute subtle signage
content to the raw thermal frames, enhancing the overall understanding of the
environment. The proposed method is validated on datasets collected from
real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior quality in traffic signage
sketching and improved detection accuracy at the perceptual level.

Abstract: Deepfake technology, driven by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), poses
significant risks to privacy and societal security. Existing detection methods
are predominantly passive, focusing on post-event analysis without preventing
attacks. To address this, we propose an active defense method based on
low-frequency perceptual perturbations to disrupt face swapping manipulation,
reducing the performance and naturalness of generated content. Unlike prior
approaches that used low-frequency perturbations to impact classification
accuracy,our method directly targets the generative process of deepfake
techniques. We combine frequency and spatial domain features to strengthen
defenses. By introducing artifacts through low-frequency perturbations while
preserving high-frequency details, we ensure the output remains visually
plausible. Additionally, we design a complete architecture featuring an
encoder, a perturbation generator, and a decoder, leveraging discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to extract low-frequency components and generate perturbations
that disrupt facial manipulation models. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW
demonstrate significant reductions in face-swapping effectiveness, improved
defense success rates, and preservation of visual quality.

Abstract: Generating 3D human motions from text is a challenging yet valuable task. The
key aspects of this task are ensuring text-motion consistency and achieving
generation diversity. Although recent advancements have enabled the generation
of precise and high-quality human motions from text, achieving diversity in the
generated motions remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we aim to
overcome the above challenge by designing a simple yet effective text-to-motion
generation method, \textit{i.e.}, Diverse-T2M. Our method introduces
uncertainty into the generation process, enabling the generation of highly
diverse motions while preserving the semantic consistency of the text.
Specifically, we propose a novel perspective that utilizes noise signals as
carriers of diversity information in transformer-based methods, facilitating a
explicit modeling of uncertainty. Moreover, we construct a latent space where
text is projected into a continuous representation, instead of a rigid
one-to-one mapping, and integrate a latent space sampler to introduce
stochastic sampling into the generation process, thereby enhancing the
diversity and uncertainty of the outputs. Our results on text-to-motion
generation benchmark datasets~(HumanML3D and KIT-ML) demonstrate that our
method significantly enhances diversity while maintaining state-of-the-art
performance in text consistency.

Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound images are inherently challenging to interpret in
liver surgery due to the limited field of view and complex anatomical
structures. Bridging the gap between preoperative and intraoperative data is
crucial for effective surgical guidance. 3D IntraVascular UltraSound (IVUS)
offers a potential solution by enabling the reconstruction of the entire organ,
which facilitates registration between preoperative computed tomography (CT)
scans and intraoperative IVUS images. In this work, we propose an
optimization-based calibration method using a 3D-printed phantom for accurate
3D Intravascular Ultrasound volume reconstruction. Our approach ensures precise
alignment of tracked IVUS data with preoperative CT images, improving
intraoperative navigation. We validated our method using in vivo swine liver
images, achieving a calibration error from 0.88 to 1.80 mm and a registration
error from 3.40 to 5.71 mm between the 3D IVUS data and the corresponding CT
scan. Our method provides a reliable and accurate means of calibration and
volume reconstruction. It can be used to register intraoperative ultrasound
images with preoperative CT images in the context of liver surgery, and enhance
intraoperative guidance.

Motivation: 半导体制造中磁場成像(MFI)数据稀缺，难以训练机器学习模型进行缺陷定位，需要生成高质量的合成数据

Method: 使用扩散模型结合物理约束生成合成MFI图像，特别针对电源短路等常见缺陷类型

Result: 与最先进的VAE和扩散生成模型相比，在定性和定量评估中显示出有希望的结果

Conclusion: PI-GenMFI方法能够有效生成逼真的MFI图像，为优化缺陷定位过程提供可行的合成数据解决方案

Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, defect detection and localization are
critical to ensuring product quality and yield. While X-ray imaging is a
reliable non-destructive testing method, it is memory-intensive and
time-consuming for large-scale scanning, Magnetic Field Imaging (MFI) offers a
more efficient means to localize regions of interest (ROI) for targeted X-ray
scanning. However, the limited availability of MFI datasets due to proprietary
concerns presents a significant bottleneck for training machine learning (ML)
models using MFI. To address this challenge, we consider an ML-driven approach
leveraging diffusion models with two physical constraints. We propose Physics
Informed Generative Models for Magnetic Field Images (PI-GenMFI) to generate
synthetic MFI samples by integrating specific physical information. We generate
MFI images for the most common defect types: power shorts. These synthetic
images will serve as training data for ML algorithms designed to localize
defect areas efficiently. To evaluate generated MFIs, we compare our model to
SOTA generative models from both variational autoencoder (VAE) and diffusion
methods. We present a domain expert evaluation to assess the generated samples.
In addition, we present qualitative and quantitative evaluation using various
metrics used for image generation and signal processing, showing promising
results to optimize the defect localization process.

Conclusion: 该研究提出的自我评估方法为大型视觉-语言模型的对齐问题提供了一种可扩展、成本效益高的解决方案，能够自主改善模型性能，具有重要的实践价值。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) have opened up new opportunities for integrating
visual and linguistic modalities. However, effectively aligning these
modalities remains challenging, often leading to hallucinations--where
generated outputs are not grounded in the visual input--and raising safety
concerns across various domains. Existing alignment methods, such as
instruction tuning and preference tuning, often rely on external datasets,
human annotations, or complex post-processing, which limit scalability and
increase costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
generates the debiased self-judgment score, a self-evaluation metric created
internally by the model without relying on external resources. This enables the
model to autonomously improve alignment. Our method enhances both decoding
strategies and preference tuning processes, resulting in reduced
hallucinations, enhanced safety, and improved overall capability. Empirical
results show that our approach significantly outperforms traditional methods,
offering a more effective solution for aligning LVLMs.

Conclusion: 该研究提出的GAN-PFO框架能够有效解决分开推理中的数据重构问题，显著提升了攻击效果和通用性，为隐私保护领域带来了新的挑战。

Abstract: The growing complexity of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has led to the adoption
of Split Inference (SI), a collaborative paradigm that partitions computation
between edge devices and the cloud to reduce latency and protect user privacy.
However, recent advances in Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRAs) reveal that
intermediate features exchanged in SI can be exploited to recover sensitive
input data, posing significant privacy risks. Existing DRAs are typically
effective only on shallow models and fail to fully leverage semantic priors,
limiting their reconstruction quality and generalizability across datasets and
model architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based DRA framework
with Progressive Feature Optimization (PFO), which decomposes the generator
into hierarchical blocks and incrementally refines intermediate representations
to enhance the semantic fidelity of reconstructed images. To stabilize the
optimization and improve image realism, we introduce an L1-ball constraint
during reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
prior attacks by a large margin, especially in high-resolution scenarios,
out-of-distribution settings, and against deeper and more complex DNNs.

Abstract: Foundation image-text models such as CLIP with zero-shot capabilities enable
a wide array of applications. MobileCLIP is a recent family of image-text
models at 3-15ms latency and 50-150M parameters with state-of-the-art zero-shot
accuracy. The main ingredients in MobileCLIP were its low-latency and light
architectures and a novel multi-modal reinforced training that made knowledge
distillation from multiple caption-generators and CLIP teachers efficient,
scalable, and reproducible. In this paper, we improve the multi-modal
reinforced training of MobileCLIP through: 1) better CLIP teacher ensembles
trained on the DFN dataset, 2) improved captioner teachers trained on the DFN
dataset and fine-tuned on a diverse selection of high-quality image-caption
datasets. We discover new insights through ablations such as the importance of
temperature tuning in contrastive knowledge distillation, the effectiveness of
caption-generator fine-tuning for caption diversity, and the additive
improvement from combining synthetic captions generated by multiple models. We
train a new family of models called MobileCLIP2 and achieve state-of-the-art
ImageNet-1k zero-shot accuracies at low latencies. In particular, we observe
2.2% improvement in ImageNet-1k accuracy for MobileCLIP2-B compared with
MobileCLIP-B architecture. Notably, MobileCLIP2-S4 matches the zero-shot
accuracy of SigLIP-SO400M/14 on ImageNet-1k while being 2$\times$ smaller and
improves on DFN ViT-L/14 at 2.5$\times$ lower latency. We release our
pretrained models (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip) and the data
generation code (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip-dr). The data
generation code makes it easy to create new reinforced datasets with arbitrary
teachers using distributed scalable processing.

Abstract: Emotional talking head synthesis aims to generate talking portrait videos
with vivid expressions. Existing methods still exhibit limitations in control
flexibility, motion naturalness, and expression quality. Moreover, currently
available datasets are primarily collected in lab settings, further
exacerbating these shortcomings. Consequently, these limitations substantially
hinder practical applications in real-world scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose EmoCAST, a diffusion-based framework with two key
modules for precise text-driven emotional synthesis. In appearance modeling,
emotional prompts are integrated through a text-guided decoupled emotive
module, enhancing the spatial knowledge to improve emotion comprehension. To
improve the relationship between audio and emotion, we introduce an emotive
audio attention module to capture the interplay between controlled emotion and
driving audio, generating emotion-aware features to guide more precise facial
motion synthesis. Additionally, we construct an emotional talking head dataset
with comprehensive emotive text descriptions to optimize the framework's
performance. Based on the proposed dataset, we propose an emotion-aware
sampling training strategy and a progressive functional training strategy that
further improve the model's ability to capture nuanced expressive features and
achieve accurate lip-synchronization. Overall, EmoCAST achieves
state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic, emotionally expressive,
and audio-synchronized talking-head videos. Project Page:

Abstract: Existing Causal-Why Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models often struggle
with higher-order reasoning, relying on opaque, monolithic pipelines that
entangle video understanding, causal inference, and answer generation. These
black-box approaches offer limited interpretability and tend to depend on
shallow heuristics. We propose a novel, modular framework that explicitly
decouples causal reasoning from answer generation, introducing natural language
causal chains as interpretable intermediate representations. Inspired by human
cognitive models, these structured cause-effect sequences bridge low-level
video content with high-level causal reasoning, enabling transparent and
logically coherent inference. Our two-stage architecture comprises a Causal
Chain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs,
and a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that produces answers grounded in
these chains. To address the lack of annotated reasoning traces, we introduce a
scalable method for generating high-quality causal chains from existing
datasets using large language models. We also propose CauCo, a new evaluation
metric for causality-oriented captioning. Experiments on three large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art
models, but also yields substantial gains in explainability, user trust, and
generalization -- positioning the CCE as a reusable causal reasoning engine
across diverse domains. Project page:

Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality in
women, and early detection is essential for improving outcomes. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) is a highly sensitive tool for breast cancer detection,
particularly in women at high risk or with dense breast tissue, where
mammography is less effective. The ODELIA consortium organized a multi-center

classification. The dataset included 511 studies from six European centers,
acquired on scanners from multiple vendors at both 1.5 T and 3 T. Each study
was labeled for the left and right breast as no lesion, benign lesion, or
malignant lesion. We developed a SwinUNETR-based deep learning framework that
incorporates breast region masking, extensive data augmentation, and ensemble
learning to improve robustness and generalizability. Our method achieved second

Conclusion: AvatarBack通过显式建模缺失的后脑区域，成功解决了3D高斯头像重建中的后脑质量问题，为完整且一致的3D头像重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have significantly boosted the
reconstruction of head avatars, enabling high-quality facial modeling by
representing an 3D avatar as a collection of 3D Gaussians. However, existing
methods predominantly rely on frontal-view images, leaving the back-head poorly
constructed. This leads to geometric inconsistencies, structural blurring, and
reduced realism in the rear regions, ultimately limiting the fidelity of
reconstructed avatars. To address this challenge, we propose AvatarBack, a
novel plug-and-play framework specifically designed to reconstruct complete and
consistent 3D Gaussian avatars by explicitly modeling the missing back-head
regions. AvatarBack integrates two core technical innovations,i.e., the
Subject-specific Generator (SSG) and the Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy
(ASA). The former leverages a generative prior to synthesize
identity-consistent, plausible back-view pseudo-images from sparse frontal
inputs, providing robust multi-view supervision. To achieve precise geometric
alignment between these synthetic views and the 3D Gaussian representation, the
later employs learnable transformation matrices optimized during training,
effectively resolving inherent pose and coordinate discrepancies. Extensive
experiments on NeRSemble and K-hairstyle datasets, evaluated using geometric,
photometric, and GPT-4o-based perceptual metrics, demonstrate that AvatarBack
significantly enhances back-head reconstruction quality while preserving
frontal fidelity. Moreover, the reconstructed avatars maintain consistent
visual realism under diverse motions and remain fully animatable.

Abstract: Identifying sitters in historical paintings is a key task for art historians,
offering insight into their lives and how they chose to be seen. However, the
process is often subjective and limited by the lack of data and stylistic
variations. Automated facial recognition is capable of handling challenging
conditions and can assist, but while traditional facial recognition models
perform well on photographs, they struggle with paintings due to domain shift
and high intra-class variation. Artistic factors such as style, skill, intent,
and influence from other works further complicate recognition. In this work, we
investigate the potential of foundation models to improve facial recognition in
artworks. By fine-tuning foundation models and integrating their embeddings
with those from conventional facial recognition networks, we demonstrate
notable improvements over current state-of-the-art methods. Our results show
that foundation models can bridge the gap where traditional methods are
ineffective. Paper page at https://www.idiap.ch/paper/artface/

Conclusion: CraftGraffiti推进了身份尊重的AI辅助艺术创作目标，为创意AI应用中风格自由与可识别性的融合提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Preserving facial identity under extreme stylistic transformation remains a
major challenge in generative art. In graffiti, a high-contrast, abstract
medium, subtle distortions to the eyes, nose, or mouth can erase the subject's
recognizability, undermining both personal and cultural authenticity. We
present CraftGraffiti, an end-to-end text-guided graffiti generation framework
designed with facial feature preservation as a primary objective. Given an
input image and a style and pose descriptive prompt, CraftGraffiti first
applies graffiti style transfer via LoRA-fine-tuned pretrained diffusion
transformer, then enforces identity fidelity through a face-consistent
self-attention mechanism that augments attention layers with explicit identity
embeddings. Pose customization is achieved without keypoints, using CLIP-guided
prompt extension to enable dynamic re-posing while retaining facial coherence.
We formally justify and empirically validate the "style-first, identity-after"
paradigm, showing it reduces attribute drift compared to the reverse order.
Quantitative results demonstrate competitive facial feature consistency and
state-of-the-art aesthetic and human preference scores, while qualitative
analyses and a live deployment at the Cruilla Festival highlight the system's
real-world creative impact. CraftGraffiti advances the goal of
identity-respectful AI-assisted artistry, offering a principled approach for
blending stylistic freedom with recognizability in creative AI applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal AI have enabled progress in detecting synthetic

intent behind AI-generated images. To fill this gap, we introduce S-HArM, a
multimodal dataset for intent-aware classification, comprising 9,576 "in the
wild" image-text pairs from Twitter/X and Reddit, labeled as Humor/Satire, Art,
or Misinformation. Additionally, we explore three prompting strategies
(image-guided, description-guided, and multimodally-guided) to construct a
large-scale synthetic training dataset with Stable Diffusion. We conduct an
extensive comparative study including modality fusion, contrastive learning,
reconstruction networks, attention mechanisms, and large vision-language
models. Our results show that models trained on image- and multimodally-guided
data generalize better to "in the wild" content, due to preserved visual
context. However, overall performance remains limited, highlighting the
complexity of inferring intent and the need for specialized architectures.

Abstract: Neural Video Compression (NVC) has achieved remarkable performance in recent
years. However, precise rate control remains a challenge due to the inherent
limitations of learning-based codecs. To solve this issue, we propose a dynamic
video compression framework designed for variable bitrate scenarios. First, to
achieve variable bitrate implementation, we propose the Dynamic-Route
Autoencoder with variable coding routes, each occupying partial computational
complexity of the whole network and navigating to a distinct RD trade-off.
Second, to approach the target bitrate, the Rate Control Agent estimates the
bitrate of each route and adjusts the coding route of DRA at run time. To
encompass a broad spectrum of variable bitrates while preserving overall RD
performance, we employ the Joint-Routes Optimization strategy, achieving
collaborative training of various routes. Extensive experiments on the HEVC and
UVG datasets show that the proposed method achieves an average BD-Rate
reduction of 14.8% and BD-PSNR gain of 0.47dB over state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining an average bitrate error of 1.66%, achieving
Rate-Distortion-Complexity Optimization (RDCO) for various bitrate and
bitrate-constrained applications. Our code is available at

Abstract: Accurate cardiac motion estimation from cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
images is vital for assessing cardiac function and detecting its abnormalities.
Existing methods often struggle to capture heart motion accurately because they
rely on intensity-based image registration similarity losses that may overlook
cardiac anatomical regions. To address this, we propose CardioMorphNet, a
recurrent Bayesian deep learning framework for 3D cardiac shape-guided
deformable registration using short-axis (SAX) CMR images. It employs a
recurrent variational autoencoder to model spatio-temporal dependencies over
the cardiac cycle and two posterior models for bi-ventricular segmentation and
motion estimation. The derived loss function from the Bayesian formulation
guides the framework to focus on anatomical regions by recursively registering
segmentation maps without using intensity-based image registration similarity
loss, while leveraging sequential SAX volumes and spatio-temporal features. The
Bayesian modelling also enables computation of uncertainty maps for the
estimated motion fields. Validated on the UK Biobank dataset by comparing
warped mask shapes with ground truth masks, CardioMorphNet demonstrates
superior performance in cardiac motion estimation, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Uncertainty assessment shows that it also yields
lower uncertainty values for estimated motion fields in the cardiac region
compared with other probabilistic-based cardiac registration methods,
indicating higher confidence in its predictions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于非典型有丝分裂图像分类的域鲁棒训练方法，通过风格扰动、注意力特征对齐和EMA教师蒸馏，在MIDOG 2025挑战赛中取得了优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非典型有丝分裂图像(AMFs)是重要的组织病理学标记，但在不同扫描仪、染色和采集条件下存在域偏移问题，导致识别一致性差

Method: 1) 在骨干网络早期和中期插入风格扰动增加特征多样性；2) 使用弱域标签通过辅助对齐损失跨站点对齐注意力精炼特征；3) 通过温度缩放KL散度从EMA教师模型蒸馏来稳定预测

Result: 在MIDOG 2025初步排行榜上获得：平衡准确率0.8762、灵敏度0.8873、特异性0.8651、ROC AUC 0.9499

Conclusion: 该方法推理开销可忽略，仅需粗粒度域元数据，提供强大且平衡的性能，是MIDOG 2025挑战赛的有竞争力方案

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are important histopathological markers yet
remain challenging to identify consistently, particularly under domain shift
stemming from scanner, stain, and acquisition differences. We present a simple
training-time recipe for domain-robust AMF classification in MIDOG 2025 Task 2.
The approach (i) increases feature diversity via style perturbations inserted
at early and mid backbone stages, (ii) aligns attention-refined features across
sites using weak domain labels (Scanner, Origin, Species, Tumor) through an
auxiliary alignment loss, and (iii) stabilizes predictions by distilling from
an exponential moving average (EMA) teacher with temperature-scaled KL
divergence. On the organizer-run preliminary leaderboard for atypical mitosis
classification, our submission attains balanced accuracy of 0.8762, sensitivity
of 0.8873, specificity of 0.8651, and ROC AUC of 0.9499. The method incurs
negligible inference-time overhead, relies only on coarse domain metadata, and
delivers strong, balanced performance, positioning it as a competitive
submission for the MIDOG 2025 challenge.

TL;DR: 提出了Pref-GRPO方法解决T2I生成中的奖励破解问题，使用成对偏好奖励替代点式评分，并引入UniGenBench基准测试进行综合评估


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于点式奖励模型的T2I生成方法容易受到奖励破解影响，微小分数差异经过归一化后会产生虚假优势，导致模型过度优化琐碎改进而破坏生成稳定性

Method: Pref-GRPO：基于成对偏好奖励的GRPO方法，在每组图像中使用偏好奖励模型进行成对比较，以胜率作为奖励信号，将优化目标从分数最大化转向偏好拟合

Result: Pref-GRPO能够区分细微的图像质量差异，提供更稳定的优势并缓解奖励破解。UniGenBench基准测试包含600个提示，涵盖5个主题和20个子主题，通过10个主要标准和27个子标准评估语义一致性

Conclusion: Pref-GRPO方法有效解决了奖励破解问题，UniGenBench基准测试为T2I模型提供了更全面的评估框架，揭示了开源和闭源模型的优缺点

Abstract: Recent advancements highlight the importance of GRPO-based reinforcement
learning methods and benchmarking in enhancing text-to-image (T2I) generation.
However, current methods using pointwise reward models (RM) for scoring
generated images are susceptible to reward hacking. We reveal that this happens
when minimal score differences between images are amplified after
normalization, creating illusory advantages that drive the model to
over-optimize for trivial gains, ultimately destabilizing the image generation
process. To address this, we propose Pref-GRPO, a pairwise preference
reward-based GRPO method that shifts the optimization objective from score
maximization to preference fitting, ensuring more stable training. In
Pref-GRPO, images are pairwise compared within each group using preference RM,
and the win rate is used as the reward signal. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PREF-GRPO differentiates subtle image quality differences,
providing more stable advantages and mitigating reward hacking. Additionally,
existing T2I benchmarks are limited by coarse evaluation criteria, hindering
comprehensive model assessment. To solve this, we introduce UniGenBench, a
unified T2I benchmark comprising 600 prompts across 5 main themes and 20
subthemes. It evaluates semantic consistency through 10 primary and 27
sub-criteria, leveraging MLLM for benchmark construction and evaluation. Our
benchmarks uncover the strengths and weaknesses of both open and closed-source
T2I models and validate the effectiveness of Pref-GRPO.

Motivation: 现有方法在编码判别性、多视图一致特征方面存在不足，难以从稀疏输入视图中构建准确的几何结构。

Method: 提出C3-GS框架，集成三个轻量级模块到统一渲染流水线中，包含上下文感知、跨维度和跨尺度约束，改进特征融合。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验验证了C3-GS达到了最先进的渲染质量和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现逼真的合成效果，且不需要额外的监督，代码已开源。

Abstract: Generalizable Gaussian Splatting aims to synthesize novel views for unseen
scenes without per-scene optimization. In particular, recent advancements
utilize feed-forward networks to predict per-pixel Gaussian parameters,
enabling high-quality synthesis from sparse input views. However, existing
approaches fall short in encoding discriminative, multi-view consistent
features for Gaussian predictions, which struggle to construct accurate
geometry with sparse views. To address this, we propose $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS, a
framework that enhances feature learning by incorporating context-aware,
cross-dimension, and cross-scale constraints. Our architecture integrates three
lightweight modules into a unified rendering pipeline, improving feature fusion
and enabling photorealistic synthesis without requiring additional supervision.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate that $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS
achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and generalization ability. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeqVLM是一个新颖的零样本3D视觉定位框架，通过多视角图像和空间信息实现目标物体推理，在ScanRefer和Nr3D基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有零样本3D视觉定位方法因依赖单视角定位而导致的空间推理受限、上下文遗漏和细节退化问题，提升真实世界应用的泛化能力。

Method: 首先通过3D语义分割网络生成3D实例提案并进行语义过滤，然后使用提案引导的多视角投影策略将候选提案投影到真实场景图像序列中，最后通过动态调度机制迭代处理序列查询提示，利用VLM的跨模态推理能力识别文本指定对象。

Result: 在ScanRefer和Nr3D基准测试中分别达到55.6%和53.2%的Acc@0.25分数，比之前的零样本方法分别提升了4.0%和5.2%。

Conclusion: SeqVLM框架显著提升了3D视觉定位的零样本性能，推动了该技术向更好泛化能力和真实世界应用适用性的发展。

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize objects in 3D scenes using
natural language descriptions. Although supervised methods achieve higher
accuracy in constrained settings, zero-shot 3DVG holds greater promise for
real-world applications since eliminating scene-specific training requirements.
However, existing zero-shot methods face challenges of spatial-limited
reasoning due to reliance on single-view localization, and contextual omissions
or detail degradation. To address these issues, we propose SeqVLM, a novel
zero-shot 3DVG framework that leverages multi-view real-world scene images with
spatial information for target object reasoning. Specifically, SeqVLM first
generates 3D instance proposals via a 3D semantic segmentation network and
refines them through semantic filtering, retaining only semantic-relevant
candidates. A proposal-guided multi-view projection strategy then projects
these candidate proposals onto real scene image sequences, preserving spatial
relationships and contextual details in the conversion process of 3D point
cloud to images. Furthermore, to mitigate VLM computational overload, we
implement a dynamic scheduling mechanism that iteratively processes
sequances-query prompts, leveraging VLM's cross-modal reasoning capabilities to
identify textually specified objects. Experiments on the ScanRefer and Nr3D
benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving Acc@0.25 scores
of 55.6% and 53.2%, surpassing previous zero-shot methods by 4.0% and 5.2%,
respectively, which advance 3DVG toward greater generalization and real-world
applicability. The code is available at https://github.com/JiawLin/SeqVLM.

TL;DR: 研究了CLIP视觉语言模型在军事环境中对遮挡的鲁棒性，发现Transformer架构优于CNN，分散遮挡比集中遮挡影响更大，微调可显著提升遮挡容忍度至60%以上


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在军事防御应用中具有零样本分类优势，但其在遮挡和低信噪比等挑战性军事环境中的鲁棒性尚未充分探索

Method: 使用18类军事车辆自定义数据集，通过不同遮挡比例评估CLIP变体的性能，采用标准化曲线下面积(NAUC)作为评估指标

Result: 1) Transformer-based CLIP优于CNN模型 2) 细粒度分散遮挡比大块连续遮挡影响更大 3) 线性探测模型在35%遮挡时性能急剧下降 4) 骨干网络微调后遮挡容忍度提升至60%以上

Conclusion: 需要在训练中加入遮挡特定的数据增强，并进一步探索补丁级敏感性和架构韧性，以实现CLIP在真实军事环境中的部署

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared embedding space, offering advantages for
defense applications with scarce labeled data. However, CLIP's robustness in
challenging military environments, with partial occlusion and degraded
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), remains underexplored. We investigate CLIP
variants' robustness to occlusion using a custom dataset of 18 military vehicle
classes and evaluate using Normalized Area Under the Curve (NAUC) across
occlusion percentages. Four key insights emerge: (1) Transformer-based CLIP
models consistently outperform CNNs, (2) fine-grained, dispersed occlusions
degrade performance more than larger contiguous occlusions, (3) despite
improved accuracy, performance of linear-probed models sharply drops at around
35% occlusion, (4) by finetuning the model's backbone, this performance drop
occurs at more than 60% occlusion. These results underscore the importance of
occlusion-specific augmentations during training and the need for further
exploration into patch-level sensitivity and architectural resilience for
real-world deployment of CLIP.

Conclusion: 该架构通过全局和多层次特征表示，有效提升了自动驾驶模型的环境理解能力，消融研究将验证各组件贡献

Abstract: Focusing on the development of an end-to-end autonomous vehicle model with
pixel-to-pixel context awareness, this research proposes the SKGE-Swin
architecture. This architecture utilizes the Swin Transformer with a skip-stage
mechanism to broaden feature representation globally and at various network
levels. This approach enables the model to extract information from distant
pixels by leveraging the Swin Transformer's Shifted Window-based Multi-head
Self-Attention (SW-MSA) mechanism and to retain critical information from the
initial to the final stages of feature extraction, thereby enhancing its
capability to comprehend complex patterns in the vehicle's surroundings. The
model is evaluated on the CARLA platform using adversarial scenarios to
simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the
SKGE-Swin architecture achieves a superior Driving Score compared to previous
methods. Furthermore, an ablation study will be conducted to evaluate the
contribution of each architectural component, including the influence of skip
connections and the use of the Swin Transformer, in improving model
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然机器在视频内容理解方面取得了显著进展，能够识别具体物体、动作和场景，但在识别抽象概念（如正义、自由、团结等）方面仍然落后于人类。抽象概念识别是视频理解中的关键开放挑战，需要基于上下文信息进行多层次的语义推理。

Conclusion: 利用多模态基础模型重新审视视频抽象概念理解这一重要开放挑战时，借鉴数十年的社区经验将有助于推动该领域的发展，并使模型更符合人类推理和价值观。

Abstract: The automatic understanding of video content is advancing rapidly. Empowered
by deeper neural networks and large datasets, machines are increasingly capable
of understanding what is concretely visible in video frames, whether it be
objects, actions, events, or scenes. In comparison, humans retain a unique
ability to also look beyond concrete entities and recognize abstract concepts
like justice, freedom, and togetherness. Abstract concept recognition forms a
crucial open challenge in video understanding, where reasoning on multiple
semantic levels based on contextual information is key. In this paper, we argue
that the recent advances in foundation models make for an ideal setting to
address abstract concept understanding in videos. Automated understanding of
high-level abstract concepts is imperative as it enables models to be more
aligned with human reasoning and values. In this survey, we study different
tasks and datasets used to understand abstract concepts in video content. We
observe that, periodically and over a long period, researchers have attempted
to solve these tasks, making the best use of the tools available at their
disposal. We advocate that drawing on decades of community experience will help
us shed light on this important open grand challenge and avoid ``re-inventing
the wheel'' as we start revisiting it in the era of multi-modal foundation
models.

Method: Global Class Activation Probabilistic Map Evaluation (GCAPME)，概率化分析所有类别的像素级激活概率图，结合SafeML检测错误诊断

Result: 在ISIC数据集上使用MobileNetV2和Vision Transformers进行评估

Conclusion: 该方法能以统一方式可视化诊断过程，降低误诊风险，提高诊断可靠性和患者安全

Abstract: Recent advancements in skin lesion classification models have significantly
improved accuracy, with some models even surpassing dermatologists' diagnostic
performance. However, in medical practice, distrust in AI models remains a
challenge. Beyond high accuracy, trustworthy, explainable diagnoses are
essential. Existing explainability methods have reliability issues, with
LIME-based methods suffering from inconsistency, while CAM-based methods
failing to consider all classes. To address these limitations, we propose
Global Class Activation Probabilistic Map Evaluation, a method that analyses
all classes' activation probability maps probabilistically and at a pixel
level. By visualizing the diagnostic process in a unified manner, it helps
reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. Furthermore, the application of SafeML
enhances the detection of false diagnoses and issues warnings to doctors and
patients as needed, improving diagnostic reliability and ultimately patient
safety. We evaluated our method using the ISIC datasets with MobileNetV2 and
Vision Transformers.

TL;DR: 本文比较了扩散分类器、CLIP和ViLT在组合泛化能力上的表现，发现扩散分类器和ViLT在概念绑定任务上表现良好，但所有模型在关系推理任务上都存在显著困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言语义的一个基本方面是能够从已知部分组合形成新含义。虽然视觉语言模型(VLMs)取得了显著进展，但有证据表明它们无法进行这种组合推理，比如CLIP在处理组合属性时会出现错误绑定。

Method: 评估三种模型（扩散分类器、CLIP和ViLT）在零样本学习(ZSL)和广义零样本学习(GZSL)设置下绑定对象与属性和关系的能力。分析了CLIP嵌入表示来探究困难根源。

Result: 扩散分类器和ViLT在概念绑定任务上表现良好，但所有模型在关系GZSL任务上都显著困难。CLIP嵌入分析表明，困难可能源于关系概念（如左右）的表示过于相似。

Conclusion: 扩散分类器在某些组合任务上表现优于判别模型，但所有VLMs在关系推理方面都面临重大挑战，这突显了改进关系表示的必要性。

Abstract: A fundamental aspect of the semantics of natural language is that novel
meanings can be formed from the composition of previously known parts.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in recent years,
however, there is evidence that they are unable to perform this kind of
composition. For example, given an image of a red cube and a blue cylinder, a
VLM such as CLIP is likely to incorrectly label the image as a red cylinder or
a blue cube, indicating it represents the image as a `bag-of-words' and fails
to capture compositional semantics. Diffusion models have recently gained
significant attention for their impressive generative abilities, and zero-shot
classifiers based on diffusion models have been shown to perform competitively
with CLIP in certain compositional tasks. In this work we explore whether the
generative Diffusion Classifier has improved compositional generalisation
abilities compared to discriminative models. We assess three models --
Diffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT -- on their ability to bind objects with
attributes and relations in both zero-shot learning (ZSL) and generalised
zero-shot learning (GZSL) settings. Our results show that the Diffusion
Classifier and ViLT perform well at concept binding tasks, but that all models
struggle significantly with the relational GZSL task, underscoring the broader
challenges VLMs face with relational reasoning. Analysis of CLIP embeddings
suggests that the difficulty may stem from overly similar representations of
relational concepts such as left and right. Code and dataset are available at:

Conclusion: 提出的面元位姿学习回归方法能够有效解决点云配准中的噪声和旋转敏感问题，在真实点云扫描上表现出色

Abstract: Point cloud registration is crucial for ensuring 3D alignment consistency of
multiple local point clouds in 3D reconstruction for remote sensing or digital
heritage. While various point cloud-based registration methods exist, both
non-learning and learning-based, they ignore point orientations and point
uncertainties, making the model susceptible to noisy input and aggressive
rotations of the input point cloud like orthogonal transformation; thus, it
necessitates extensive training point clouds with transformation augmentations.
To address these issues, we propose a novel surfel-based pose learning
regression approach. Our method can initialize surfels from Lidar point cloud
using virtual perspective camera parameters, and learns explicit
$\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant features, including both position and rotation
through $\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant convolutional kernels to predict relative
transformation between source and target scans. The model comprises an
equivariant convolutional encoder, a cross-attention mechanism for similarity
computation, a fully-connected decoder, and a non-linear Huber loss.
Experimental results on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate our model
superiority and robust performance on real point-cloud scans compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Accurate dental caries detection from panoramic X-rays plays a pivotal role
in preventing lesion progression. However, current detection methods often
yield suboptimal accuracy due to subtle contrast variations and diverse lesion
morphology of dental caries. In this work, inspired by the clinical workflow
where dentists systematically combine whole-image screening with detailed
tooth-level inspection, we present DVCTNet, a novel Dual-View Co-Training
network for accurate dental caries detection. Our DVCTNet starts with employing
automated tooth detection to establish two complementary views: a global view
from panoramic X-ray images and a local view from cropped tooth images. We then
pretrain two vision foundation models separately on the two views. The
global-view foundation model serves as the detection backbone, generating
region proposals and global features, while the local-view model extracts
detailed features from corresponding cropped tooth patches matched by the
region proposals. To effectively integrate information from both views, we
introduce a Gated Cross-View Attention (GCV-Atten) module that dynamically
fuses dual-view features, enhancing the detection pipeline by integrating the
fused features back into the detection model for final caries detection. To
rigorously evaluate our DVCTNet, we test it on a public dataset and further
validate its performance on a newly curated, high-precision dental caries
detection dataset, annotated using both intra-oral images and panoramic X-rays
for double verification. Experimental results demonstrate DVCTNet's superior
performance against existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both datasets,
indicating the clinical applicability of our method. Our code and labeled
dataset are available at https://github.com/ShanghaiTech-IMPACT/DVCTNet.

Motivation: 现有的可见光和红外图像融合方法主要关注图像质量优化，虽然近期研究开始结合下游任务提供语义指导，但语义分割需要大量标注，目标检测在拥挤场景中面临边界框重叠和遮挡问题。RGB-T人群计数虽然受到关注，但尚未与图像融合集成到统一框架中。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了现有方法在密集场景中的局限性，通过最小化标注需求的人群计数任务为图像融合提供有效指导，证明了多任务学习在视觉任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Most visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) methods focus primarily on
optimizing fused image quality. Recent studies have begun incorporating
downstream tasks, such as semantic segmentation and object detection, to
provide semantic guidance for VIF. However, semantic segmentation requires
extensive annotations, while object detection, despite reducing annotation
efforts compared with segmentation, faces challenges in highly crowded scenes
due to overlapping bounding boxes and occlusion. Moreover, although RGB-T crowd
counting has gained increasing attention in recent years, no studies have
integrated VIF and crowd counting into a unified framework. To address these
challenges, we propose FusionCounting, a novel multi-task learning framework
that integrates crowd counting into the VIF process. Crowd counting provides a
direct quantitative measure of population density with minimal annotation,
making it particularly suitable for dense scenes. Our framework leverages both
input images and population density information in a mutually beneficial
multi-task design. To accelerate convergence and balance tasks contributions,
we introduce a dynamic loss function weighting strategy. Furthermore, we
incorporate adversarial training to enhance the robustness of both VIF and
crowd counting, improving the model's stability and resilience to adversarial
attacks. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that
FusionCounting not only enhances image fusion quality but also achieves
superior crowd counting performance.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel pipeline for 2D keypoint estima- tion of surgical
tools by leveraging Vision Language Models (VLMs) fine- tuned using a low rank
adjusting (LoRA) technique. Unlike traditional Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) or Transformer-based approaches, which often suffer from overfitting in
small-scale medical datasets, our method harnesses the generalization
capabilities of pre-trained VLMs. We carefully design prompts to create an
instruction-tuning dataset and use them to align visual features with semantic
keypoint descriptions. Experimental results show that with only two epochs of
fine tuning, the adapted VLM outperforms the baseline models, demonstrating the
ef- fectiveness of LoRA in low-resource scenarios. This approach not only
improves keypoint detection performance, but also paves the way for future work
in 3D surgical hands and tools pose estimation.

Conclusion: 该研究成功将RWKV模型扩展到点云数据领域，解决了其在非结构化数据上的挑战，为点云分类领域通用化提供了一种高效且简洁的解决方案，同时保持了RWKV的线性计算效率优势。

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) has been recently explored to enhance the
generalizability of Point Cloud Classification (PCC) models toward unseen
domains. Prior works are based on convolutional networks, Transformer or Mamba
architectures, either suffering from limited receptive fields or high
computational cost, or insufficient long-range dependency modeling. RWKV, as an
emerging architecture, possesses superior linear complexity, global receptive
fields, and long-range dependency. In this paper, we present the first work
that studies the generalizability of RWKV models in DG PCC. We find that
directly applying RWKV to DG PCC encounters two significant challenges: RWKV's
fixed direction token shift methods, like Q-Shift, introduce spatial
distortions when applied to unstructured point clouds, weakening local
geometric modeling and reducing robustness. In addition, the Bi-WKV attention
in RWKV amplifies slight cross-domain differences in key distributions through
exponential weighting, leading to attention shifts and degraded generalization.
To this end, we propose PointDGRWKV, the first RWKV-based framework tailored
for DG PCC. It introduces two key modules to enhance spatial modeling and
cross-domain robustness, while maintaining RWKV's linear efficiency. In
particular, we present Adaptive Geometric Token Shift to model local
neighborhood structures to improve geometric context awareness. In addition,
Cross-Domain key feature Distribution Alignment is designed to mitigate
attention drift by aligning key feature distributions across domains. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PointDGRWKV achieves
state-of-the-art performance on DG PCC.

TL;DR: PathMR是一个细胞级多模态视觉推理框架，用于病理图像分析，能够同时生成专家级诊断解释和预测细胞分布模式，在文本生成质量、分割精度和跨模态对齐方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在病理诊断中提高了效率但缺乏透明性，多模态视觉推理架构通过提供像素级分割掩码和语义对齐的文本解释来解决这一问题，但需要进一步发展到细胞级别。

Method: 提出PathMR框架，给定病理图像和文本查询，同时生成专家级诊断解释和预测细胞分布模式，在两个数据集上进行评估。

Result: 在PathGen和新开发的GADVR数据集上，PathMR在文本生成质量、分割精度和跨模态对齐方面持续优于最先进的视觉推理方法。

Conclusion: PathMR展示了在AI驱动病理诊断中提高可解释性的潜力，代码将公开提供。

Abstract: Deep learning based automated pathological diagnosis has markedly improved
diagnostic efficiency and reduced variability between observers, yet its
clinical adoption remains limited by opaque model decisions and a lack of
traceable rationale. To address this, recent multimodal visual reasoning
architectures provide a unified framework that generates segmentation masks at
the pixel level alongside semantically aligned textual explanations. By
localizing lesion regions and producing expert style diagnostic narratives,
these models deliver the transparent and interpretable insights necessary for
dependable AI assisted pathology. Building on these advancements, we propose
PathMR, a cell-level Multimodal visual Reasoning framework for Pathological
image analysis. Given a pathological image and a textual query, PathMR
generates expert-level diagnostic explanations while simultaneously predicting
cell distribution patterns. To benchmark its performance, we evaluated our
approach on the publicly available PathGen dataset as well as on our newly
developed GADVR dataset. Extensive experiments on these two datasets
demonstrate that PathMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art visual
reasoning methods in text generation quality, segmentation accuracy, and
cross-modal alignment. These results highlight the potential of PathMR for
improving interpretability in AI-driven pathological diagnosis. The code will
be publicly available in https://github.com/zhangye-zoe/PathMR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺导管腺癌（PDAC）是致死率最高的癌症之一，五年生存率低于10%，主要原因是晚期检测。需要开发早期检测方法来提高生存率

Method: 使用双模态成像数据，评估了6种深度学习架构（包括传统CNN和现代ViT），采用改进的ResNet架构，包含冻结预训练层和类别加权训练来解决数据集小和类别不平衡问题

Result: 最终优化的框架在癌症检测方面实现了超过90%的准确率，显著优于当前的手动分析方法

Conclusion: 建立了一个强大的自动化PDAC检测流程，可以增强病理学家的能力，并为扩展到其他癌症类型奠定了基础，同时为小规模医学影像数据集应用深度学习提供了宝贵见解

Abstract: Pacreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal forms
of cancer, with a five-year survival rate below 10% primarily due to late
detection. This research develops and validates a deep learning framework for
early PDAC detection through analysis of dual-modality imaging:
autofluorescence and second harmonic generation (SHG). We analyzed 40 unique
patient samples to create a specialized neural network capable of
distinguishing between normal, fibrotic, and cancerous tissue. Our methodology
evaluated six distinct deep learning architectures, comparing traditional
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with modern Vision Transformers (ViTs).
Through systematic experimentation, we identified and overcome significant
challenges in medical image analysis, including limited dataset size and class
imbalance. The final optimized framework, based on a modified ResNet
architecture with frozen pre-trained layers and class-weighted training,
achieved over 90% accuracy in cancer detection. This represents a significant
improvement over current manual analysis methods an demonstrates potential for
clinical deployment. This work establishes a robust pipeline for automated PDAC
detection that can augment pathologists' capabilities while providing a
foundation for future expansion to other cancer types. The developed
methodology also offers valuable insights for applying deep learning to
limited-size medical imaging datasets, a common challenge in clinical
applications.

*Pushkar Shukla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了基于反事实推理的框架，用于解释、审计和缓解视觉分类器和生成模型中的偏见，包括CAVLI、ASAC、TIBET、BiasConnect和InterMit等方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反事实推理已成为可解释和公平AI的核心方法，但需要系统化框架来发现虚假相关性、探索因果依赖关系，并构建更鲁棒的系统。

Method: 开发了多种方法：CAVLI整合归因和概念级分析；ASAC使用对抗性反事实扰动；TIBET提供可扩展的偏见评估流程；BiasConnect构建因果图；InterMit提供无需训练的偏见缓解算法。

Result: 这些方法能够量化模型对可解释概念的依赖程度，提高模型公平性和准确性，实现因果审计和交互式偏见诊断，并提供模块化的偏见缓解方案。

Conclusion: 反事实推理为判别性和生成性模型中的可解释性、公平性和因果性提供了统一视角，建立了原则性、可扩展的社会责任偏见评估和缓解方法。

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning -- the practice of asking ``what if'' by varying
inputs and observing changes in model behavior -- has become central to
interpretable and fair AI. This thesis develops frameworks that use
counterfactuals to explain, audit, and mitigate bias in vision classifiers and
generative models. By systematically altering semantically meaningful
attributes while holding others fixed, these methods uncover spurious
correlations, probe causal dependencies, and help build more robust systems.
  The first part addresses vision classifiers. CAVLI integrates attribution
(LIME) with concept-level analysis (TCAV) to quantify how strongly decisions
rely on human-interpretable concepts. With localized heatmaps and a Concept
Dependency Score, CAVLI shows when models depend on irrelevant cues like
backgrounds. Extending this, ASAC introduces adversarial counterfactuals that
perturb protected attributes while preserving semantics. Through curriculum
learning, ASAC fine-tunes biased models for improved fairness and accuracy
while avoiding stereotype-laden artifacts.
  The second part targets generative Text-to-Image (TTI) models. TIBET provides
a scalable pipeline for evaluating prompt-sensitive biases by varying
identity-related terms, enabling causal auditing of how race, gender, and age
affect image generation. To capture interactions, BiasConnect builds causal
graphs diagnosing intersectional biases. Finally, InterMit offers a modular,
training-free algorithm that mitigates intersectional bias via causal
sensitivity scores and user-defined fairness goals.
  Together, these contributions show counterfactuals as a unifying lens for
interpretability, fairness, and causality in both discriminative and generative
models, establishing principled, scalable methods for socially responsible bias
evaluation and mitigation.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle perception typically relies on modular pipelines that
decompose the task into detection, tracking, and prediction. While
interpretable, these pipelines suffer from error accumulation and limited
inter-task synergy. Unified perception has emerged as a promising paradigm that
integrates these sub-tasks within a shared architecture, potentially improving
robustness, contextual reasoning, and efficiency while retaining interpretable
outputs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of unified
perception, introducing a holistic and systemic taxonomy that categorizes
methods along task integration, tracking formulation, and representation flow.
We define three paradigms -Early, Late, and Full Unified Perception- and
systematically review existing methods, their architectures, training
strategies, datasets used, and open-source availability, while highlighting
future research directions. This work establishes the first comprehensive
framework for understanding and advancing unified perception, consolidates
fragmented efforts, and guides future research toward more robust,
generalizable, and interpretable perception.

Conclusion: 利用通用基础模型的优质密集预训练特征，为提升医学图像分割精度提供了高效且参数效率高的方法，证明了该框架的高度可扩展性。

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on large-scale natural image datasets offer a
powerful paradigm for medical image segmentation. However, effectively
transferring their learned representations for precise clinical applications
remains a challenge. In this work, we propose Dino U-Net, a novel
encoder-decoder architecture designed to exploit the high-fidelity dense
features of the DINOv3 vision foundation model. Our architecture introduces an
encoder built upon a frozen DINOv3 backbone, which employs a specialized
adapter to fuse the model's rich semantic features with low-level spatial
details. To preserve the quality of these representations during dimensionality
reduction, we design a new fidelity-aware projection module (FAPM) that
effectively refines and projects the features for the decoder. We conducted
extensive experiments on seven diverse public medical image segmentation
datasets. Our results show that Dino U-Net achieves state-of-the-art
performance, consistently outperforming previous methods across various imaging
modalities. Our framework proves to be highly scalable, with segmentation
accuracy consistently improving as the backbone model size increases up to the
7-billion-parameter variant. The findings demonstrate that leveraging the
superior, dense-pretrained features from a general-purpose foundation model
provides a highly effective and parameter-efficient approach to advance the
accuracy of medical image segmentation. The code is available at

Abstract: Mitotic figures (MFs) are relevant biomarkers in tumor grading.
Differentiating atypical MFs (AMFs) from normal MFs (NMFs) remains difficult,
as manual annotation is time-consuming and subjective. In this work an ensemble
of ConvNeXtBase models was trained with AUCMEDI and extend with a rule-based
refinement (RBR) module. On the MIDOG25 preliminary test set, the ensemble
achieved a balanced accuracy of 84.02%. While the RBR increased specificity, it
reduced sensitivity and overall performance. The results show that deep
ensembles perform well for AMF classification. RBR can increase specific
metrics but requires further research.

Abstract: In the era of Industry 5.0, monitoring human activity is essential for
ensuring both ergonomic safety and overall well-being. While multi-camera
centralized setups improve pose estimation accuracy, they often suffer from
high computational costs and bandwidth requirements, limiting scalability and
real-time applicability. Distributing processing across edge devices can reduce
network bandwidth and computational load. On the other hand, the constrained
resources of edge devices lead to accuracy degradation, and the distribution of
computation leads to temporal and spatial inconsistencies. We address this
challenge by proposing COMETH (Convex Optimization for Multiview Estimation and
Tracking of Humans), a lightweight algorithm for real-time multi-view human
pose fusion that relies on three concepts: it integrates kinematic and
biomechanical constraints to increase the joint positioning accuracy; it
employs convex optimization-based inverse kinematics for spatial fusion; and it
implements a state observer to improve temporal consistency. We evaluate COMETH
on both public and industrial datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in localization, detection, and tracking accuracy. The proposed fusion
pipeline enables accurate and scalable human motion tracking, making it
well-suited for industrial and safety-critical applications. The code is
publicly available at https://github.com/PARCO-LAB/COMETH.

Abstract: Many high-performance networks were not designed with lightweight application
scenarios in mind from the outset, which has greatly restricted their scope of
application. This paper takes ConvNeXt as the research object and significantly
reduces the parameter scale and network complexity of ConvNeXt by integrating
the Cross Stage Partial Connections mechanism and a series of optimized

model's network complexity by up to 80%; (2) Optimizing the Stem and Block
structures to enhance the model's feature expression capability and operational
efficiency; (3) Replacing Layer Scale with channel attention. Experimental
validation on ImageNet classification demonstrates E-ConvNeXt's superior
accuracy-efficiency balance: E-ConvNeXt-mini reaches 78.3% Top-1 accuracy at

Conclusion: 该方法有效缓解了数据缺乏问题，显著提高了图像置换定位的性能，为该领域提供了大规模高质量数据支持

Abstract: Images manipulated using image editing tools can mislead viewers and pose
significant risks to social security. However, accurately localizing the
manipulated regions within an image remains a challenging problem. One of the
main barriers in this area is the high cost of data acquisition and the severe
lack of high-quality annotated datasets. To address this challenge, we
introduce novel methods that mitigate data scarcity by leveraging readily
available web data. We utilize a large collection of manually forged images
from the web, as well as automatically generated annotations derived from a
simpler auxiliary task, constrained image manipulation localization.
Specifically, we introduce a new paradigm CAAAv2, which automatically and
accurately annotates manipulated regions at the pixel level. To further improve
annotation quality, we propose a novel metric, QES, which filters out
unreliable annotations. Through CAAA v2 and QES, we construct MIMLv2, a
large-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset containing 246,212 manually
forged images with pixel-level mask annotations. This is over 120x larger than
existing handcrafted datasets like IMD20. Additionally, we introduce Object
Jitter, a technique that further enhances model training by generating
high-quality manipulation artifacts. Building on these advances, we develop a
new model, Web-IML, designed to effectively leverage web-scale supervision for
the image manipulation localization task. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach substantially alleviates the data scarcity problem and
significantly improves the performance of various models on multiple real-world
forgery benchmarks. With the proposed web supervision, Web-IML achieves a
striking performance gain of 31% and surpasses previous SOTA TruFor by 24.1
average IoU points. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at

Abstract: Simulating detector responses is a crucial part of understanding the inner
workings of particle collisions in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Such
simulations are currently performed with statistical Monte Carlo methods, which
are computationally expensive and put a significant strain on CERN's
computational grid. Therefore, recent proposals advocate for generative machine
learning methods to enable more efficient simulations. However, the
distribution of the data varies significantly across the simulations, which is
hard to capture with out-of-the-box methods. In this study, we present
ExpertSim - a deep learning simulation approach tailored for the Zero Degree
Calorimeter in the ALICE experiment. Our method utilizes a
Mixture-of-Generative-Experts architecture, where each expert specializes in
simulating a different subset of the data. This allows for a more precise and
efficient generation process, as each expert focuses on a specific aspect of
the calorimeter response. ExpertSim not only improves accuracy, but also
provides a significant speedup compared to the traditional Monte-Carlo methods,
offering a promising solution for high-efficiency detector simulations in
particle physics experiments at CERN. We make the code available at

Method: 采用两阶段蒸馏：1）稳定性预热机制稳定对抗蒸馏，优化单步映射质量；2）统一对抗平衡机制促进稳定单步对抗训练达到纳什均衡；3）条件对抗一致性提高条件帧与生成帧的语义和帧一致性。

Result: 在VBench-I2V上平均提升7.15%的语义对齐、时间一致性和帧质量，将预训练模型延迟减少100倍（从1000秒到10秒），同时保持竞争力性能。

Conclusion: POSE成功解决了大规模视频扩散模型的采样效率问题，实现了高质量单步视频生成，显著提升了实际应用价值。

Abstract: The field of video diffusion generation faces critical bottlenecks in
sampling efficiency, especially for large-scale models and long sequences.
Existing video acceleration methods adopt image-based techniques but suffer
from fundamental limitations: they neither model the temporal coherence of
video frames nor provide single-step distillation for large-scale video models.
To bridge this gap, we propose POSE (Phased One-Step Equilibrium), a
distillation framework that reduces the sampling steps of large-scale video
diffusion models, enabling the generation of high-quality videos in a single
step. POSE employs a carefully designed two-phase process to distill video
models:(i) stability priming: a warm-up mechanism to stabilize adversarial
distillation that adapts the high-quality trajectory of the one-step generator
from high to low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, optimizing the video quality of
single-step mappings near the endpoints of flow trajectories. (ii) unified
adversarial equilibrium: a flexible self-adversarial distillation mechanism
that promotes stable single-step adversarial training towards a Nash
equilibrium within the Gaussian noise space, generating realistic single-step
videos close to real videos. For conditional video generation, we propose (iii)
conditional adversarial consistency, a method to improve both semantic
consistency and frame consistency between conditional frames and generated
frames. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that POSE outperforms other
acceleration methods on VBench-I2V by average 7.15% in semantic alignment,
temporal conference and frame quality, reducing the latency of the pre-trained
model by 100$\times$, from 1000 seconds to 10 seconds, while maintaining
competitive performance.

Conclusion: 该方法无需训练，可以无缝集成到现有流程中，支持提示集扩展，有效减少大规模文本到图像生成的环境和财务成本

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models enable high-quality image generation but are
computationally expensive. While prior work optimizes per-inference efficiency,
we explore an orthogonal approach: reducing redundancy across correlated
prompts. Our method leverages the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion models,
where early denoising steps capture shared structures among similar prompts. We
propose a training-free approach that clusters prompts based on semantic
similarity and shares computation in early diffusion steps. Experiments show
that for models trained conditioned on image embeddings, our approach
significantly reduces compute cost while improving image quality. By leveraging
UnClip's text-to-image prior, we enhance diffusion step allocation for greater
efficiency. Our method seamlessly integrates with existing pipelines, scales
with prompt sets, and reduces the environmental and financial burden of
large-scale text-to-image generation. Project page:

Conclusion: Mamba-based方法在医学图像分割任务中表现出潜力，但在有丝分裂检测的跨域泛化问题上仍需进一步优化和改进。

Abstract: Mitosis detection in histopathology images plays a key role in tumor
assessment. Although machine learning algorithms could be exploited for aiding
physicians in accurately performing such a task, these algorithms suffer from
significative performance drop when evaluated on images coming from domains
that are different from the training ones. In this work, we propose a
Mamba-based approach for mitosis detection under domain shift, inspired by the
promising performance demonstrated by Mamba in medical imaging segmentation
tasks. Specifically, our approach exploits a VM-UNet architecture for carrying
out the addressed task, as well as stain augmentation operations for further
improving model robustness against domain shift. Our approach has been
submitted to the track 1 of the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG)
challenge. Preliminary experiments, conducted on the MIDOG++ dataset, show
large room for improvement for the proposed method.

Abstract: Recognizing atypical mitotic figures in histopathology images allows
physicians to correctly assess tumor aggressiveness. Although machine learning
models could be exploited for automatically performing such a task, under
domain shift these models suffer from significative performance drops. In this
work, an approach based on multi-task learning is proposed for addressing this

object to classify, ignoring the domain varying background of the image. The
proposed approach shows promising performance in a preliminary evaluation

TL;DR: FW-GAN是一个单样本手写合成框架，通过整合相位感知Wave-MLP和频率引导鉴别器，生成高质量、风格一致的手写文本，解决了传统方法在长距离依赖和频率信息建模方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标记手写数据稀缺限制了识别系统的效果，现有合成方法存在两个主要问题：传统卷积架构难以建模长距离依赖和复杂笔画模式，以及忽视了频率信息在捕捉细粒度风格细节中的关键作用。

Method: 提出FW-GAN框架，包含相位感知Wave-MLP生成器来捕捉空间关系并保留风格线索，频率引导鉴别器利用高频成分增强真实性检测，以及新颖的频率分布损失来对齐合成与真实手写的频率特征。

Result: 在越南语和英语手写数据集上的实验表明，FW-GAN能够生成高质量、风格一致的手写文本，有效增强低资源手写识别流程的数据。

Conclusion: FW-GAN通过频率感知的生成对抗网络架构，显著提升了手写合成的真实性和风格一致性，为低资源手写识别提供了有价值的数据增强工具。

Abstract: Labeled handwriting data is often scarce, limiting the effectiveness of
recognition systems that require diverse, style-consistent training samples.
Handwriting synthesis offers a promising solution by generating artificial data
to augment training. However, current methods face two major limitations.
First, most are built on conventional convolutional architectures, which
struggle to model long-range dependencies and complex stroke patterns. Second,
they largely ignore the crucial role of frequency information, which is
essential for capturing fine-grained stylistic and structural details in
handwriting. To address these challenges, we propose FW-GAN, a one-shot
handwriting synthesis framework that generates realistic, writer-consistent
text from a single example. Our generator integrates a phase-aware Wave-MLP to
better capture spatial relationships while preserving subtle stylistic cues. We
further introduce a frequency-guided discriminator that leverages
high-frequency components to enhance the authenticity detection of generated
samples. Additionally, we introduce a novel Frequency Distribution Loss that
aligns the frequency characteristics of synthetic and real handwriting, thereby
enhancing visual fidelity. Experiments on Vietnamese and English handwriting
datasets demonstrate that FW-GAN generates high-quality, style-consistent
handwriting, making it a valuable tool for augmenting data in low-resource
handwriting recognition (HTR) pipelines. Official implementation is available

TL;DR: MMG-Vid是一个无需训练的视频token剪枝框架，通过最大化边际增益在片段级和token级去除冗余，能在保持99.5%性能的同时减少75%视觉token并加速3.9倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频大语言模型的视觉token过多导致计算效率低下，现有方法未考虑视频的动态特性和时间依赖性

Method: 提出两阶段方法：1）基于帧相似性分割视频并动态分配token预算；2）使用时序引导的DPC算法联合建模帧间独特性和帧内多样性

Result: 在LLaVA-OneVision-7B上保持99.5%原始性能，减少75%视觉token，预填充阶段加速3.9倍

Conclusion: MMG-Vid通过最大化有限token预算的利用率，在显著提升效率的同时保持强大性能，为视频理解的实际应用提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) excel in video understanding, but their
excessive visual tokens pose a significant computational challenge for
real-world applications. Current methods aim to enhance inference efficiency by
visual token pruning. However, they do not consider the dynamic characteristics
and temporal dependencies of video frames, as they perceive video understanding
as a multi-frame task. To address these challenges, we propose MMG-Vid, a novel
training-free visual token pruning framework that removes redundancy by
Maximizing Marginal Gains at both segment-level and token-level. Specifically,
we first divide the video into segments based on frame similarity, and then
dynamically allocate the token budget for each segment to maximize the marginal
gain of each segment. Subsequently, we propose a temporal-guided DPC algorithm
that jointly models inter-frame uniqueness and intra-frame diversity, thereby
maximizing the marginal gain of each token. By combining both stages, MMG-Vid
can maximize the utilization of the limited token budget, significantly
improving efficiency while maintaining strong performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MMG-Vid can maintain over 99.5% of the original
performance, while effectively reducing 75% visual tokens and accelerating the
prefilling stage by 3.9x on LLaVA-OneVision-7B. Code will be released soon.

Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言-动作模型需要大量后训练，计算开销大，限制了可扩展性和部署。受人类多模态协调启发，需要更高效的框架。

Method: 采用3阶段渐进架构：1) EFA-Routing通过指令信息选择性聚合视觉token；2) LFP-Routing通过剪枝实现token级稀疏化；3) V-L-A耦合注意力机制确保压缩感知输入仍能支持准确动作生成。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试和真实机器人任务中分别达到97.4%和70.0%的成功率，实现最先进性能。

Conclusion: CogVLA通过认知对齐设计，在显著降低计算成本的同时提升了性能，为高效VLA模型提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built on pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) require extensive post-training, resulting in
high computational overhead that limits scalability and deployment.We propose
CogVLA, a Cognition-Aligned Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages
instruction-driven routing and sparsification to improve both efficiency and
performance. CogVLA draws inspiration from human multimodal coordination and
introduces a 3-stage progressive architecture. 1) Encoder-FiLM based
Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instruction information into the
vision encoder to selectively aggregate and compress dual-stream visual tokens,
forming a instruction-aware latent representation. 2) Building upon this
compact visual encoding, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing)
introduces action intent into the language model by pruning
instruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens, thereby achieving token-level
sparsity. 3) To ensure that compressed perception inputs can still support
accurate and coherent action generation, we introduce V-L-A Coupled Attention
(CAtten), which combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional
action parallel decoding. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and
real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art
performance with success rates of 97.4% and 70.0%, respectively, while reducing
training costs by 2.5-fold and decreasing inference latency by 2.8-fold
compared to OpenVLA. CogVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at

Motivation: 现有学术基准与工业实践存在严重差异，训练源同质化且测试图像质量低，阻碍了检测器的实际部署

Method: 构建分层泛化测试的HydraFake数据集；提出Veritas MLLM检测器，采用模式感知推理（规划和自我反思）模拟人类取证过程；设计两阶段训练流程

Result: 传统检测器在跨模型场景表现良好但在未见伪造技术和数据域上不足；Veritas在不同OOD场景中取得显著增益，能够提供透明可信的检测输出

Conclusion: HydraFake数据集有效模拟真实世界挑战，Veritas检测器通过模式感知推理显著提升深度伪造检测的泛化能力和可解释性

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a formidable challenge due to the complex and
evolving nature of fake content in real-world scenarios. However, existing
academic benchmarks suffer from severe discrepancies from industrial practice,
typically featuring homogeneous training sources and low-quality testing
images, which hinder the practical deployments of current detectors. To
mitigate this gap, we introduce HydraFake, a dataset that simulates real-world
challenges with hierarchical generalization testing. Specifically, HydraFake
involves diversified deepfake techniques and in-the-wild forgeries, along with
rigorous training and evaluation protocol, covering unseen model architectures,
emerging forgery techniques and novel data domains. Building on this resource,
we propose Veritas, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) based deepfake
detector. Different from vanilla chain-of-thought (CoT), we introduce
pattern-aware reasoning that involves critical reasoning patterns such as
"planning" and "self-reflection" to emulate human forensic process. We further
propose a two-stage training pipeline to seamlessly internalize such deepfake
reasoning capacities into current MLLMs. Experiments on HydraFake dataset
reveal that although previous detectors show great generalization on
cross-model scenarios, they fall short on unseen forgeries and data domains.
Our Veritas achieves significant gains across different OOD scenarios, and is
capable of delivering transparent and faithful detection outputs.

Motivation: 当前深度伪造检测主要针对完全合成的视频，但局部细微修改的伪造视频更具欺骗性且缺乏专门的检测方法和数据集，存在严重的安全漏洞。

Method: 提出了FakeParts局部深度伪造概念，创建了包含2.5万+视频的FakePartsBench数据集，提供像素级和帧级标注，并通过用户研究和SOTA检测模型进行系统性评估。

Result: 实验表明FakeParts使人类检测准确率下降30%以上，现有最佳检测模型也出现类似性能退化，证实了当前检测方法的严重脆弱性。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了当前深度伪造检测在局部修改方面的重大漏洞，提供了必要的数据集资源来开发更鲁棒的检测方法应对这种新型威胁。

Abstract: We introduce FakeParts, a new class of deepfakes characterized by subtle,
localized manipulations to specific spatial regions or temporal segments of
otherwise authentic videos. Unlike fully synthetic content, these partial
manipulations, ranging from altered facial expressions to object substitutions
and background modifications, blend seamlessly with real elements, making them
particularly deceptive and difficult to detect. To address the critical gap in
detection capabilities, we present FakePartsBench, the first large-scale
benchmark dataset specifically designed to capture the full spectrum of partial
deepfakes. Comprising over 25K videos with pixel-level and frame-level
manipulation annotations, our dataset enables comprehensive evaluation of
detection methods. Our user studies demonstrate that FakeParts reduces human
detection accuracy by over 30% compared to traditional deepfakes, with similar
performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art detection models. This
work identifies an urgent vulnerability in current deepfake detection
approaches and provides the necessary resources to develop more robust methods
for partial video manipulations.

Motivation: 现有单目跟踪器存在深度歧义和遮挡问题，而传统多摄像头方法需要20个以上摄像头且需每个序列优化，故需要一种更实用的多视角3D点跟踪方法

Method: 使用已知摄像机姿势和深度信息，将多视角特征融合成统一点云，采用k近邻相关性和转换器基于更新机制来估计长程3D对应关系

Result: 在Panoptic Studio和DexYCB两个真实数据集上，中位轨迹误差分别为3.1cm和2.0cm，能够良好适应1-8个摄像头的各种视角配置和24-150帧的视频长度

Conclusion: 该方法为多视角3D跟踪研究设定了新标准，提供了一种实用的实际应用工具，通过发布跟踪器和数据集促进该领域发展

Abstract: We introduce the first data-driven multi-view 3D point tracker, designed to
track arbitrary points in dynamic scenes using multiple camera views. Unlike
existing monocular trackers, which struggle with depth ambiguities and
occlusion, or prior multi-camera methods that require over 20 cameras and
tedious per-sequence optimization, our feed-forward model directly predicts 3D
correspondences using a practical number of cameras (e.g., four), enabling
robust and accurate online tracking. Given known camera poses and either
sensor-based or estimated multi-view depth, our tracker fuses multi-view
features into a unified point cloud and applies k-nearest-neighbors correlation
alongside a transformer-based update to reliably estimate long-range 3D
correspondences, even under occlusion. We train on 5K synthetic multi-view
Kubric sequences and evaluate on two real-world benchmarks: Panoptic Studio and
DexYCB, achieving median trajectory errors of 3.1 cm and 2.0 cm, respectively.
Our method generalizes well to diverse camera setups of 1-8 views with varying
vantage points and video lengths of 24-150 frames. By releasing our tracker
alongside training and evaluation datasets, we aim to set a new standard for
multi-view 3D tracking research and provide a practical tool for real-world
applications. Project page available at https://ethz-vlg.github.io/mvtracker.

Conclusion: OneReward框架证明了使用单一奖励模型可以有效提升多任务生成能力，为多任务生成模型提供了一种高效统一的训练方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OneReward, a unified reinforcement learning
framework that enhances the model's generative capabilities across multiple
tasks under different evaluation criteria using only \textit{One Reward} model.
By employing a single vision-language model (VLM) as the generative reward
model, which can distinguish the winner and loser for a given task and a given
evaluation criterion, it can be effectively applied to multi-task generation
models, particularly in contexts with varied data and diverse task objectives.
We utilize OneReward for mask-guided image generation, which can be further
divided into several sub-tasks such as image fill, image extend, object
removal, and text rendering, involving a binary mask as the edit area. Although
these domain-specific tasks share same conditioning paradigm, they differ
significantly in underlying data distributions and evaluation metrics. Existing
methods often rely on task-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which limits
generalization and training efficiency. Building on OneReward, we develop
Seedream 3.0 Fill, a mask-guided generation model trained via multi-task
reinforcement learning directly on a pre-trained base model, eliminating the
need for task-specific SFT. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified
edit model consistently outperforms both commercial and open-source

Result: 实现了接近完美的水印移除效果（95.7%），对剩余图像质量影响可忽略不计

Conclusion: 该方法成功展示了现有水印技术的脆弱性，希望激励开发更鲁棒的图像水印方法

Abstract: Content watermarking is an important tool for the authentication and
copyright protection of digital media. However, it is unclear whether existing
watermarks are robust against adversarial attacks. We present the winning
solution to the NeurIPS 2024 Erasing the Invisible challenge, which
stress-tests watermark robustness under varying degrees of adversary knowledge.
The challenge consisted of two tracks: a black-box and beige-box track,
depending on whether the adversary knows which watermarking method was used by
the provider. For the beige-box track, we leverage an adaptive VAE-based
evasion attack, with a test-time optimization and color-contrast restoration in
CIELAB space to preserve the image's quality. For the black-box track, we first
cluster images based on their artifacts in the spatial or frequency-domain.
Then, we apply image-to-image diffusion models with controlled noise injection
and semantic priors from ChatGPT-generated captions to each cluster with
optimized parameter settings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method
successfully achieves near-perfect watermark removal (95.7%) with negligible
impact on the residual image's quality. We hope that our attacks inspire the
development of more robust image watermarking methods.
