### [1] [Semantic Attractors and the Emergence of Meaning: Towards a Teleological Model of AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18290)
*Hans-Joachim Rudolph*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于复数意义空间中语义吸引子的理论框架，探索不同于统计预测的递归张量变换语义模型，通过虚数单位i的循环操作建模反讽、同音异义和歧义现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于transformer的语言模型依赖统计性的下一个词预测，无法真正理解语义。需要开发一种能够形成意义而非仅仅推断概率的新型认知架构。

Method: 使用复数空间中的递归张量变换和循环操作，引入语义吸引子作为目的性算子，通过梯度流、张量变形和迭代矩阵动力学来建模语义转换。

Result: 提出了能够建模反讽、同音异义和歧义等复杂语义现象的数学框架，语义吸引子能够引导意义向稳定性、清晰性和表达深度发展。

Conclusion: 真正的意义不是通过模拟产生，而是通过向语义一致性的递归收敛而涌现，这需要一种旨在塑造语言而不仅仅是预测语言的全新认知架构。

Abstract: This essay develops a theoretical framework for a semantic Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI) based on the notion of semantic attractors in complex-valued
meaning spaces. Departing from current transformer-based language models, which
operate on statistical next-token prediction, we explore a model in which
meaning is not inferred probabilistically but formed through recursive
tensorial transformation. Using cyclic operations involving the imaginary unit
\emph{i}, we describe a rotational semantic structure capable of modeling
irony, homonymy, and ambiguity. At the center of this model, however, is a
semantic attractor -- a teleological operator that, unlike statistical
computation, acts as an intentional agent (Microvitum), guiding meaning toward
stability, clarity, and expressive depth. Conceived in terms of gradient flows,
tensor deformations, and iterative matrix dynamics, the attractor offers a
model of semantic transformation that is not only mathematically suggestive,
but also philosophically significant. We argue that true meaning emerges not
from simulation, but from recursive convergence toward semantic coherence, and
that this requires a fundamentally new kind of cognitive architecture -- one
designed to shape language, not just predict it.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KAIROS基准测试研究LLM在多智能体系统中的信任形成、抗误导能力和同伴整合机制，发现GRPO强化学习结合多智能体上下文能获得最佳性能但降低社交影响鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在多智能体系统中如何通过历史印象建立信任、抵抗错误信息并整合同伴输入，这些因素对复杂社交动态下的集体智能实现至关重要。

Method: 提出KAIROS基准测试，模拟不同可靠性智能体参与的问答竞赛，控制专家-新手角色、噪声群体和对抗性同伴等条件，评估提示工程、监督微调和强化学习（GRPO）等缓解策略。

Result: GRPO结合多智能体上下文、基于结果的奖励和无约束推理获得最佳整体性能，但相比基础模型降低了社交影响的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 多智能体强化学习能提升LLM在协作环境中的决策性能，但需要平衡性能提升与社交影响鲁棒性之间的关系。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems
(MAS) as components of collaborative intelligence, where peer interactions
dynamically shape individual decision-making. Although prior work has focused
on conformity bias, we extend the analysis to examine how LLMs form trust from
previous impressions, resist misinformation, and integrate peer input during
interaction, key factors for achieving collective intelligence under complex
social dynamics. We present KAIROS, a benchmark simulating quiz contests with
peer agents of varying reliability, offering fine-grained control over
conditions such as expert-novice roles, noisy crowds, and adversarial peers.
LLMs receive both historical interactions and current peer responses, allowing
systematic investigation into how trust, peer action, and self-confidence
influence decisions. As for mitigation strategies, we evaluate prompting,
supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, Group Relative Policy
Optimisation (GRPO), across multiple models. Our results reveal that GRPO with
multi-agent context combined with outcome-based rewards and unconstrained
reasoning achieves the best overall performance, but also decreases the
robustness to social influence compared to Base models. The code and datasets
are available at: https://github.com/declare-lab/KAIROS.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LangCrUX数据集分析显示多语言网站普遍忽视可访问性提示，导致屏幕阅读器在多语言环境下表现不佳，研究者提出了Kizuki扩展来解决这一问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着网络多语言内容增长，辅助技术对非拉丁文字支持不足，导致视觉障碍用户面临严重的可访问性挑战，但缺乏大规模多语言网络内容数据集限制了相关研究

Method: 引入LangCrUX数据集（包含12种非拉丁文字的12万个流行网站），进行系统性多语言网络可访问性分析，并提出Kizuki语言感知自动化可访问性测试扩展

Result: 发现可访问性提示往往无法反映可见内容的语言多样性，降低了屏幕阅读器的有效性，限制了网络可访问性

Conclusion: 多语言网络可访问性存在普遍忽视，需要语言感知的自动化测试工具来改善非拉丁文字支持，Kizuki扩展为解决这一问题提供了可行方案

Abstract: English is the predominant language on the web, powering nearly half of the
world's top ten million websites. Support for multilingual content is
nevertheless growing, with many websites increasingly combining English with
regional or native languages in both visible content and hidden metadata. This
multilingualism introduces significant barriers for users with visual
impairments, as assistive technologies like screen readers frequently lack
robust support for non-Latin scripts and misrender or mispronounce non-English
text, compounding accessibility challenges across diverse linguistic contexts.
Yet, large-scale studies of this issue have been limited by the lack of
comprehensive datasets on multilingual web content. To address this gap, we
introduce LangCrUX, the first large-scale dataset of 120,000 popular websites
across 12 languages that primarily use non-Latin scripts. Leveraging this
dataset, we conduct a systematic analysis of multilingual web accessibility and
uncover widespread neglect of accessibility hints. We find that these hints
often fail to reflect the language diversity of visible content, reducing the
effectiveness of screen readers and limiting web accessibility. We finally
propose Kizuki, a language-aware automated accessibility testing extension to
account for the limited utility of language-inconsistent accessibility hints.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PLAST是一种通过精确语言特定层微调来高效提升大型视觉语言模型多语言能力的训练方法，仅需调整14%参数即可显著改善多语言性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多语言能力上存在不平衡，研究发现多语言理解能力与浅层语言特定神经元激活存在显著相关性

Method: 首先通过监控语言特定神经元激活来识别参与多语言理解的层，然后使用问题翻译对精确微调这些层以实现多语言对齐

Result: 在MM-Bench和MMMB基准测试中有效提升了多语言能力，仅调整14%参数就实现了显著效率

Conclusion: PLAST方法可推广到低资源和复杂视觉推理任务，促进浅层语言特定视觉信息参与

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated exceptional
capabilities in understanding visual information with human languages but also
exhibit an imbalance in multilingual capabilities. In this work, we delve into
the multilingual working pattern of LVLMs and identify a salient correlation
between the multilingual understanding ability of LVLMs and language-specific
neuron activations in shallow layers. Building on this insight, we introduce
PLAST, a training recipe that achieves efficient multilingual enhancement for
LVLMs by Precise LAnguage-Specific layers fine-Tuning. PLAST first identifies
layers involved in multilingual understanding by monitoring language-specific
neuron activations. These layers are then precisely fine-tuned with
question-translation pairs to achieve multilingual alignment. Our empirical
results on MM-Bench and MMMB demonstrate that PLAST effectively improves the
multilingual capabilities of LVLMs and achieves significant efficiency with
only 14% of the parameters tuned. Further analysis reveals that PLAST can be
generalized to low-resource and complex visual reasoning tasks, facilitating
the language-specific visual information engagement in shallow layers.

### [5] [Backprompting: Leveraging Synthetic Production Data for Health Advice Guardrails](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18384)
*Kellen Tan Cheng,Anna Lisa Gentile,Chad DeLuca,Guang-Jie Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出backprompting方法生成生产级标注数据，结合稀疏人工聚类技术，用于医疗建议护栏开发，在参数少400倍的情况下性能超越GPT-4o达3.73%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业环境中大型语言模型使用带来风险，护栏技术需要过滤输入输出文本，但获取真实LLM输出的生产质量标注数据困难。

Method: 使用backprompting生成生产类似标注数据，结合稀疏人工循环聚类技术标注生成数据，构建平行语料库并注入现有数据集。

Result: 在医疗建议识别这一最困难的护栏任务中，该方法相比其他解决方案表现更优，检测器性能超越GPT-4o达3.73%。

Conclusion: backprompting方法能有效生成生产级标注数据，为护栏检测器开发提供高质量训练数据，在资源效率上显著优于大型模型。

Abstract: The pervasiveness of large language models (LLMs) in enterprise settings has
also brought forth a significant amount of risks associated with their usage.
Guardrails technologies aim to mitigate this risk by filtering LLMs'
input/output text through various detectors. However, developing and
maintaining robust detectors faces many challenges, one of which is the
difficulty in acquiring production-quality labeled data on real LLM outputs
prior to deployment. In this work, we propose backprompting, a simple yet
intuitive solution to generate production-like labeled data for health advice
guardrails development. Furthermore, we pair our backprompting method with a
sparse human-in-the-loop clustering technique to label the generated data. Our
aim is to construct a parallel corpus roughly representative of the original
dataset yet resembling real LLM output. We then infuse existing datasets with
our synthetic examples to produce robust training data for our detector. We
test our technique in one of the most difficult and nuanced guardrails: the
identification of health advice in LLM output, and demonstrate improvement
versus other solutions. Our detector is able to outperform GPT-4o by up to
3.73%, despite having 400x less parameters.

### [6] [Integral Transformer: Denoising Attention, Not Too Much Not Too Little](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18387)
*Ivan Kobyzev,Abbas Ghaddar,Dingtao Hu,Boxing Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Integral Transformer通过从logit分布中采样信号来整合注意力，有效减少注意力噪声同时保留关键特殊标记的信息，在多项基准测试中优于传统、Cog和Differential注意力变体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决softmax自注意力机制中特殊标记和标点符号等语义信息较少的token获得过多权重的问题（注意力噪声），同时避免现有方法可能丢弃有用信息的风险。

Method: 提出Integral Transformer自注意力机制，通过从logit分布中采样信号进行积分来去噪注意力，在保留特殊标记关键贡献的同时减轻噪声。

Result: 在成熟的知识和推理语言基准测试中表现优于传统、Cog和Differential注意力变体；分析显示下层使用传统自注意力可提升性能，Integral Transformer能有效平衡注意力分布并减少上层秩崩溃。

Conclusion: Integral Transformer提供了一种有效的注意力去噪方法，既能减轻噪声干扰，又能保留关键信息，在Transformer架构的不同层级中展现出优越的性能平衡能力。

Abstract: Softmax self-attention often assigns disproportionate weight to semantically
uninformative tokens such as special tokens and punctuation, a phenomenon known
as attention noise. While recent methods like Cog Attention and the
Differential Transformer have addressed this by introducing negative attention
scores, they risk discarding useful information. In this paper, we propose the
Integral Transformer, a novel self-attention mechanism that denoises attention
by integrating signals sampled from the logit distribution. Our approach
mitigates noise while preserving the contributions of special tokens critical
for model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
outperforms vanilla, Cog, and Differential attention variants on
well-established knowledge and reasoning language benchmarks. Moreover, our
analysis reveals that employing vanilla self-attention in the lower Transformer
layers enhances performance and that the Integral Transformer effectively
balances attention distributions and reduces rank collapse in upper layers.

### [7] [Latent Self-Consistency for Reliable Majority-Set Selection in Short- and Long-Answer Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18395)
*Jeong-seok Oh,Jay-yoon Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Latent Self-Consistency (LSC) 是一种新的概率解码方法，通过可学习的词嵌入选择语义最一致的回答，在短形式和长形式推理任务上均优于现有方法，计算开销可忽略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂或长形式问题上经常产生不一致的输出。现有方法如Self-Consistency主要针对短问答，而Universal Self-Consistency和WUCS虽然扩展到长回答但牺牲了短形式的准确性。

Method: LSC使用可学习的词嵌入选择语义最一致的回答，通过轻量级的前向生成摘要标记，推理时间仅增加不到1%，且无需改变模型架构。

Result: 在6个短形式和5个长形式推理基准测试中，LSC在所有短形式和长形式任务上平均超越了SC、USC和WUCS，同时保持可忽略的计算开销。

Conclusion: LSC是一种实用的跨答案格式一致性选择方法，能提供良好校准的置信度估计，在两种答案格式上都保持较低的期望校准误差。

Abstract: Probabilistic decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs) often yields
inconsistent outputs, particularly on complex or long-form questions.
Self-Consistency (SC) mitigates this for short-form QA by majority voting over
exact strings, whereas Universal Self-Consistency (USC) and Weighted Unigram
Consistency Score (WUCS) extend to long-form responses but lose accuracy on
short-form benchmarks.
  We introduce Latent Self-Consistency (LSC), which selects the most
semantically consistent response using learnable token embeddings. A
lightweight forward generation of summary tokens increases inference time by
less than 1% and requires no changes to the model architecture.
  Across 6 short-form and 5 long-form reasoning benchmarks (e.g., MATH, MMLU,
TruthfulQA), LSC surpasses SC, USC and WUCS on all short-form and long-form
ones on average, while maintaining negligible computational overhead. These
results position LSC as a practical consistency-selection method that works
reliably across answer formats. Additionally, LSC provides well-calibrated
confidence estimates, maintaining low Expected Calibration Error across both
answer formats.

### [8] [Can Out-of-Distribution Evaluations Uncover Reliance on Shortcuts? A Case Study in Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18407)
*Michal Štefánik,Timothee Mickus,Marek Kadlčík,Michal Spiegel,Josef Kuchař*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文挑战了OOD评估的假设，发现在QA任务中不同OOD数据集对模型鲁棒性的评估质量差异很大，有些甚至不如简单的ID评估。作者提出了更稳健的泛化评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战当前AI研究中通过OOD数据集评估模型泛化能力的假设，认为这种评估方法可能无法真实反映模型在实际部署中的失败模式。

Method: 将OOD评估结果与现有QA模型中记录的具体失败模式（如依赖虚假特征或预测捷径）进行对比分析。

Result: 发现不同OOD数据集对模型鲁棒性的评估质量差异显著，部分数据集表现甚至不如简单的in-distribution评估。虚假捷径在ID和OOD数据集间共享，且数据集训练质量和评估质量可能脱节。

Conclusion: 指出了常用OOD评估方法的局限性，为QA及其他领域提供了更稳健的泛化评估方法论和建议。

Abstract: A majority of recent work in AI assesses models' generalization capabilities
through the lens of performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. Despite
their practicality, such evaluations build upon a strong assumption: that OOD
evaluations can capture and reflect upon possible failures in a real-world
deployment.
  In this work, we challenge this assumption and confront the results obtained
from OOD evaluations with a set of specific failure modes documented in
existing question-answering (QA) models, referred to as a reliance on spurious
features or prediction shortcuts.
  We find that different datasets used for OOD evaluations in QA provide an
estimate of models' robustness to shortcuts that have a vastly different
quality, some largely under-performing even a simple, in-distribution
evaluation. We partially attribute this to the observation that spurious
shortcuts are shared across ID+OOD datasets, but also find cases where a
dataset's quality for training and evaluation is largely disconnected. Our work
underlines limitations of commonly-used OOD-based evaluations of
generalization, and provides methodology and recommendations for evaluating
generalization within and beyond QA more robustly.

### [9] [How Reliable are LLMs for Reasoning on the Re-ranking task?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18444)
*Nafis Tanveer Islam,Zhiming Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文分析不同训练方法如何影响大语言模型在重排序任务中的语义理解能力，并研究模型是否能生成更合理的文本推理来提高透明度和解决训练数据有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型语义理解能力的提升，虽然与人类价值观更加一致，但透明度降低。在用户参与度低、排名数据不足的新系统中，准确重排序仍然是一个重大挑战。

Method: 使用环境与地球科学领域的相对较小的排名数据集对检索内容进行重排序，分析不同训练方法对LLMs语义理解的影响，并研究可解释性信息。

Result: 研究发现某些训练方法比其他方法表现出更好的可解释性，表明并非所有训练方法都能学习到准确的语义理解，而是获得了抽象知识来优化评估。

Conclusion: 需要深入理解LLMs内部工作机制来理解重排序背后的推理过程，为最终用户提供解释，使他们能够做出明智的决策。同时质疑LLMs的真正可靠性。

Abstract: With the improving semantic understanding capability of Large Language Models
(LLMs), they exhibit a greater awareness and alignment with human values, but
this comes at the cost of transparency. Although promising results are achieved
via experimental analysis, an in-depth understanding of the LLM's internal
workings is unavoidable to comprehend the reasoning behind the re-ranking,
which provides end users with an explanation that enables them to make an
informed decision. Moreover, in newly developed systems with limited user
engagement and insufficient ranking data, accurately re-ranking content remains
a significant challenge. While various training methods affect the training of
LLMs and generate inference, our analysis has found that some training methods
exhibit better explainability than others, implying that an accurate semantic
understanding has not been learned through all training methods; instead,
abstract knowledge has been gained to optimize evaluation, which raises
questions about the true reliability of LLMs. Therefore, in this work, we
analyze how different training methods affect the semantic understanding of the
re-ranking task in LLMs and investigate whether these models can generate more
informed textual reasoning to overcome the challenges of transparency or LLMs
and limited training data. To analyze the LLMs for re-ranking tasks, we utilize
a relatively small ranking dataset from the environment and the Earth science
domain to re-rank retrieved content. Furthermore, we also analyze the
explainable information to see if the re-ranking can be reasoned using
explainability.

### [10] [Integrating gender inclusivity into large language models via instruction tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18466)
*Alina Wróblewska,Bartosz Żuk*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究通过IPIS数据集调优多语言和波兰语专用LLMs，为波兰语设计性别包容性系统提示，以减轻语言生成中的性别偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 波兰语由于历史和政治惯例，主要使用阳性形式指代男性、女性和混合性别群体，导致LLMs继承并强化了这种男性偏见，生成性别不平衡的输出。

Method: 使用IPIS数据集（包含人工制作的性别包容性校对和波兰语-英语翻译指令）调优LLMs，基于理论语言学框架设计明确的性别包容性系统提示。

Result: 实验对多语言LLMs（Llama-8B、Mistral-7B、Mistral-Nemo）和波兰语专用LLMs（Bielik、PLLuM）进行了IPIS调优。

Conclusion: 该方法旨在将性别包容性作为模型的固有特征，为减轻波兰语生成中的性别偏见提供系统性解决方案。

Abstract: Imagine a language with masculine, feminine, and neuter grammatical genders,
yet, due to historical and political conventions, masculine forms are
predominantly used to refer to men, women and mixed-gender groups. This is the
reality of contemporary Polish. A social consequence of this unfair linguistic
system is that large language models (LLMs) trained on Polish texts inherit and
reinforce this masculine bias, generating gender-imbalanced outputs. This study
addresses this issue by tuning LLMs using the IPIS dataset, a collection of
human-crafted gender-inclusive proofreading in Polish and Polish-to-English
translation instructions. Grounded in a theoretical linguistic framework, we
design a system prompt with explicit gender-inclusive guidelines for Polish. In
our experiments, we IPIS-tune multilingual LLMs (Llama-8B, Mistral-7B and
Mistral-Nemo) and Polish-specific LLMs (Bielik and PLLuM). Our approach aims to
integrate gender inclusivity as an inherent feature of these models, offering a
systematic solution to mitigate gender bias in Polish language generation.

*Jiawei Li,Akshayaa Magesh,Venugopal V. Veeravalli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出将大语言模型幻觉检测问题形式化为假设检验问题，并借鉴多重检验方法来解决该问题，实验证明该方法优于现有最先进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然强大但容易产生幻觉（生成看似自信但实际错误或无意义的回答），需要有效的检测方法来识别这些不可靠的输出。

Method: 将幻觉检测问题形式化为假设检验问题，借鉴机器学习中的分布外检测思想，提出基于多重检验的方法来检测大语言模型的幻觉。

Result: 通过大量实验验证，该方法在检测幻觉方面表现出强大的鲁棒性，优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 将幻觉检测作为假设检验问题并采用多重检验方法是有效的解决方案，能够可靠地检测大语言模型生成的幻觉内容。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful foundational
models to solve a variety of tasks, they have also been shown to be prone to
hallucinations, i.e., generating responses that sound confident but are
actually incorrect or even nonsensical. In this work, we formulate the problem
of detecting hallucinations as a hypothesis testing problem and draw parallels
to the problem of out-of-distribution detection in machine learning models. We
propose a multiple-testing-inspired method to solve the hallucination detection
problem, and provide extensive experimental results to validate the robustness
of our approach against state-of-the-art methods.

*Maike Züfle,Vilém Zouhar,Tu Anh Dinh,Felipe Maia Polo,Jan Niehues,Mrinmaya Sachan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出两种新的机器翻译自动评估指标COMET-polycand和COMET-polyic，通过引入多个备选翻译或相似文本的翻译示例来提升评估性能，相比传统单翻译评估方法有显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器翻译自动评估指标通常只考虑源句子和单个翻译，而人类评估时会参考多个备选翻译，这种评估设置差异可能影响自动指标的性能。

Method: COMET-polycand使用同一源句的多个备选翻译进行比较；COMET-polyic借鉴检索式上下文学习，输入相似源文本的翻译及其人工标注质量分数来指导评估。

Result: COMET-polycand加入单个额外翻译即可提升段级指标性能（Kendall's tau-b相关性从0.079提升至0.118），加入更多翻译效果更好；COMET-polyic通过检索示例获得类似改进（0.079到0.116）。

Conclusion: 引入多个翻译信息可以显著提升机器翻译自动评估指标的性能，模型已公开发布。

Abstract: Automated metrics for machine translation attempt to replicate human
judgment. Unlike humans, who often assess a translation in the context of
multiple alternatives, these metrics typically consider only the source
sentence and a single translation. This discrepancy in the evaluation setup may
negatively impact the performance of automated metrics. We propose two
automated metrics that incorporate additional information beyond the single
translation. COMET-polycand uses alternative translations of the same source
sentence to compare and contrast with the translation at hand, thereby
providing a more informed assessment of its quality. COMET-polyic, inspired by
retrieval-based in-context learning, takes in translations of similar source
texts along with their human-labeled quality scores to guide the evaluation. We
find that including a single additional translation in COMET-polycand improves
the segment-level metric performance (0.079 to 0.118 Kendall's tau-b
correlation), with further gains when more translations are added.
Incorporating retrieved examples in COMET-polyic yields similar improvements
(0.079 to 0.116 Kendall's tau-b correlation). We release our models publicly.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种自评估视觉隐喻生成框架，通过隐喻分解和意义对齐指标来提升生成质量，包含训练无关和训练相关两种方法，在多个指标上超越强基线模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉隐喻生成需要同时理解语言含义和保持视觉连贯性，现有方法在隐喻对齐方面存在挑战，需要更好的评估和生成框架

Method: 提出自评估框架，结合新提出的隐喻分解分数和意义对齐指标；开发两种方法：训练无关的S-T-M提示分解管道和训练相关的自评估奖励方案

Result: 训练无关方法在分解、CLIP和MA分数上超越GPT-4o和Imagen等强基线；用户研究显示GPT-4o整体更受偏好，但开源方法在抽象隐喻上表现优异

Conclusion: 结构化提示和轻量级强化学习在有限计算资源下能有效进行隐喻对齐，与人类偏好的差距主要来自美学质量和采样设置敏感性

Abstract: Visual metaphor generation is a challenging task that aims to generate an
image given an input text metaphor. Inherently, it needs language understanding
to bind a source concept with a target concept, in a way that preserves meaning
while ensuring visual coherence. We propose a self-evaluating visual metaphor
generation framework that focuses on metaphor alignment. Our self-evaluation
approach combines existing metrics with our newly proposed metaphor
decomposition score and a meaning alignment (MA) metric. Within this setup, we
explore two novel approaches: a training-free pipeline that explicitly
decomposes prompts into source-target-meaning (S-T-M) mapping for image
synthesis, and a complementary training-based pipeline that improves alignment
using our proposed self-evaluation reward schema, without any large-scale
retraining. On the held-out test set, the training-free approach surpasses
strong closed baselines (GPT-4o, Imagen) on decomposition, CLIP, and MA scores,
with the training-based approach close behind. We evaluate our framework output
using a user-facing study, and observed that participants preferred GPT-4o
overall, while our training-free pipeline led open-source methods and edged
Imagen on abstract metaphors. Our analyses show S-T-M prompting helps longer or
more abstract metaphors, with closed models excelling on short, concrete cases;
we also observe sensitivity to sampler settings. Overall, structured prompting
and lightweight RL perform metaphor alignment well under modest compute, and
remaining gaps to human preference appear driven by aesthetics and sampling.

### [14] [What do language models model? Transformers, automata, and the format of thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18598)
*Colin Klein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文认为大型语言模型并非模拟人类认知能力，而是对训练语料的建模，因为Transformer架构的计算格式与人类语言处理的超线性格式存在根本差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型本质上是模拟人类语言能力还是仅仅对训练语料进行建模，旨在澄清LLM与人类认知能力之间的关系。

Method: 通过分析Transformer架构的计算不变性，对比人类语言处理的超线性计算格式，并借鉴Liu等人关于快捷自动机的理论来解释LLM的工作机制。

Result: 论证表明Transformer架构最多支持线性处理格式，与人类语言处理所需的超线性格式不匹配，因此LLM更可能是对语料的建模而非人类认知的模拟。

Conclusion: LLM和人类以不同方式学会了使用语言这一"话语机器"，LLM的成功并不贬低人类语言能力的价值，而是展示了语言技术的另一种使用方式。

Abstract: What do large language models actually model? Do they tell us something about
human capacities, or are they models of the corpus we've trained them on? I
give a non-deflationary defence of the latter position. Cognitive science tells
us that linguistic capabilities in humans rely supralinear formats for
computation. The transformer architecture, by contrast, supports at best a
linear formats for processing. This argument will rely primarily on certain
invariants of the computational architecture of transformers. I then suggest a
positive story about what transformers are doing, focusing on Liu et al.
(2022)'s intriguing speculations about shortcut automata. I conclude with why I
don't think this is a terribly deflationary story. Language is not (just) a
means for expressing inner state but also a kind of 'discourse machine' that
lets us make new language given appropriate context. We have learned to use
this technology in one way; LLMs have also learned to use it too, but via very
different means.

TL;DR: NOOV是一个新的神经机器翻译系统，专门用于将电子健康记录从英语翻译到西班牙语，通过整合双语词典和短语查找表来解决未知词和词汇重复问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录(EHR)的英西翻译具有重要临床意义，但面临缺乏平行语料库和大量未知词汇的挑战

Method: NOOV系统整合了从平行语料库自动学习的双语词典和从大型生物医学知识资源提取的短语查找表，缓解NMT中的未知词问题和词汇重复挑战

Result: 评估显示NOOV能够生成更好的EHR翻译，在准确性和流畅性方面都有改进

Conclusion: NOOV系统有效解决了临床文本翻译中的关键挑战，为医疗领域的跨语言交流提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Translating electronic health record (EHR) narratives from English to Spanish
is a clinically important yet challenging task due to the lack of a
parallel-aligned corpus and the abundant unknown words contained. To address
such challenges, we propose \textbf{NOOV} (for No OOV), a new neural machine
translation (NMT) system that requires little in-domain parallel-aligned corpus
for training. NOOV integrates a bilingual lexicon automatically learned from
parallel-aligned corpora and a phrase look-up table extracted from a large
biomedical knowledge resource, to alleviate both the unknown word problem and
the word-repeat challenge in NMT, enhancing better phrase generation of NMT
systems. Evaluation shows that NOOV is able to generate better translation of
EHR with improvement in both accuracy and fluency.

*Chenxi Zhou,Pengfei Cao,Jiang Li,Jun Zhao,Kang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过实验研究建立了大语言模型后训练量化的任务分层缩放律，发现知识记忆能力比知识利用能力对量化参数更为敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然后训练量化(PTQ)是大语言模型部署的实用压缩方案，但现有研究缺乏对PTQ如何精确影响不同LLM知识能力的全面理解，而且现有缩放律常忽略了PTQ特定参数和任务特定敏感性。

Method: 进行广泛的实证研究，将LLM知识解构为记忆能力和利用能力，并开发包含模型大小、有效位宽、校准集大小和组大小的统一量化框架。

Result: 核心发现是知识记忆能力在有效位宽、校准集大小和模型大小的变化下显示出明显更高的敏感性，而知识利用能力则更加稳健。

Conclusion: 这些发现提供了对PTQ影响的细粒度理解，为开发能更好保留目标认知功能的知识意识量化策略提供了指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to
their scale, with post-training quantization (PTQ) emerging as a practical
compression solution. However, a comprehensive understanding of how PTQ
precisely impacts diverse LLM knowledge capabilities remains elusive, and
existing scaling laws for quantized models often overlook crucial PTQ-specific
parameters and task-specific sensitivities. This paper addresses these gaps by
conducting an extensive empirical investigation to establish task-stratified
scaling laws. We disentangle LLM knowledge into memorization and utilization
capabilities and develop a unified quantitative framework that incorporates
model size, effective bit-width, calibration set size, and group size. Our
central finding reveals that knowledge memorization exhibits markedly greater
sensitivity to variations in effective bit-width, calibration set size, and
model size compared to the more robust knowledge utilization. These findings
offer a fine-grained understanding of PTQ's impact and provide guidance for
developing knowledge-aware quantization strategies that can better preserve
targeted cognitive functions.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了TBYS框架，通过在推理步骤之间插入insights来指导LLMs的复杂推理过程，解决了训练数据中人类内在思维缺失的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在复杂推理任务（如数学）中表现不佳，主要原因是训练数据缺乏人类推理时的内在思维过程（意图和方法论），这些关键信息对于连接推理步骤至关重要。

Method: 提出Thinking Before You Speak (TBYS)框架，在连续推理步骤之间主动生成insights来审查状态并启动下一步推理。设计自动化流水线收集和筛选上下文示例，减少人工标注和微调开销。

Result: 在具有挑战性的数学数据集上的实验验证了TBYS的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过在推理过程中插入主动生成的insights，TBYS框架显著提升了LLMs在复杂推理任务上的表现，为解决训练数据中人类内在思维缺失问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit deficiencies with complex
reasoning tasks, such as maths, which we attribute to the discrepancy between
human reasoning patterns and those presented in the LLMs' training data. When
dealing with complex problems, humans tend to think carefully before expressing
solutions. However, they often do not articulate their inner thoughts,
including their intentions and chosen methodologies. Consequently, critical
insights essential for bridging reasoning steps may be absent in training data
collected from human sources. To bridge this gap, we proposes inserting
\emph{insight}s between consecutive reasoning steps, which review the status
and initiate the next reasoning steps. Unlike prior prompting strategies that
rely on a single or a workflow of static prompts to facilitate reasoning,
\emph{insight}s are \emph{proactively} generated to guide reasoning processes.
We implement our idea as a reasoning framework, named \emph{Thinking Before You
Speak} (TBYS), and design a pipeline for automatically collecting and filtering
in-context examples for the generation of \emph{insight}s, which alleviates
human labeling efforts and fine-tuning overheads. Experiments on challenging
mathematical datasets verify the effectiveness of TBYS. Project website:

TL;DR: 提出Collaborative Decoding (CoDe)方法，通过动态整合有外部知识和无外部知识的输出概率，在保持表达力的同时提高大语言模型的忠实度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在整合外部知识时难以同时保持忠实度和表达力，要么缺乏知识支持而损害忠实度，要么过于冗长而牺牲表达力。

Method: 基于分布差异和模型置信度动态整合有/无外部知识的输出概率，并引入知识感知重排序机制防止过度依赖参数知识。

Result: CoDe框架在不同大语言模型和评估指标上均表现出色，在保持表达力的同时显著提升了忠实度。

Conclusion: CoDe方法有效解决了忠实度与表达力之间的权衡问题，具有很好的有效性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Grounding responses in external knowledge represents an effective strategy
for mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current
LLMs struggle to seamlessly integrate knowledge while simultaneously
maintaining faithfulness (or fidelity) and expressiveness, capabilities that
humans naturally possess. This limitation results in outputs that either lack
support from external knowledge, thereby compromising faithfulness, or appear
overly verbose and unnatural, thus sacrificing expressiveness. In this work, to
break the trade-off between faithfulness and expressiveness, we propose
Collaborative Decoding (CoDe), a novel approach that dynamically integrates
output probabilities generated with and without external knowledge. This
integration is guided by distribution divergence and model confidence, enabling
the selective activation of relevant and reliable expressions from the model's
internal parameters. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge-aware reranking
mechanism that prevents over-reliance on prior parametric knowledge while
ensuring proper utilization of provided external information. Through
comprehensive experiments, our plug-and-play CoDe framework demonstrates
superior performance in enhancing faithfulness without compromising
expressiveness across diverse LLMs and evaluation metrics, validating both its
effectiveness and generalizability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音大语言模型缺乏对用户语音中丰富情感和副语言线索的深入理解，而情感理解对于提升人机交互体验至关重要。当前大多数具有共情能力的语音LLM需要海量数据和计算资源进行训练

Method: 提出新颖的Emotion Omni模型架构，能够理解用户语音输入的情感内容并生成共情语音响应。基于开源TTS框架开发数据生成管道，构建了20万条情感对话数据集

Result: 成功构建了支持共情语音助手的数据集和模型架构，实现了在有限数据条件下生成 empathetic 语音响应的能力

Conclusion: Emotion Omni为解决语音LLM在有限数据下实现情感理解和共情响应生成提供了有效方案，通过创新的架构设计和数据生成方法，降低了训练资源需求

Abstract: With the development of speech large language models (speech LLMs), users can
now interact directly with assistants via speech. However, most existing models
simply convert the response content into speech without fully understanding the
rich emotional and paralinguistic cues embedded in the user's query. In many
cases, the same sentence can have different meanings depending on the emotional
expression. Furthermore, emotional understanding is essential for improving
user experience in human-machine interaction. Currently, most speech LLMs with
empathetic capabilities are trained on massive datasets. This approach requires
vast amounts of data and significant computational resources. Therefore, a key
challenge lies in how to develop a speech LLM capable of generating empathetic
responses with limited data and without the need for large-scale training. To
address this challenge, we propose Emotion Omni, a novel model architecture
designed to understand the emotional content of user speech input and generate
empathetic speech responses. Additionally, we developed a data generation
pipeline based on an open-source TTS framework to construct a 200k emotional
dialogue dataset, which supports the construction of an empathetic speech
assistant. The demos are available at https://w311411.github.io/omni_demo/

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于教育学原理的多模态链式思绪提示框架，通过结合模型感知难度和内在样本复杂性来优化提示示例选择，从而提升多模态大语言模型的稳定性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的多模态链式思绪提示使用随机或手动选择的示例，无法考虑模型特定的知识分布和任务的内在复杂性，导致模型性能不优且不稳定。

Method: 将提示选择重构为提示课程设计问题，结合两种信号：(1)模型感知难度（通过主动学习中的预测分歧来量化）；(2)内在样本复杂性（测量问题-图像对的本质难度）。通过关联分析这些信号开发难度平衡的采样策略。

Result: 在5个具有挑战性的测试集和多个流行多模态大语言模型上进行的广泛实验显示，该方法带来了显著且一致的性能提升，大大减少了随机采样导致的性能差异。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种有理论基础的健壁方法，通过根据模型能力调整提示示例的难度水平，有效地增强了多模态推理能力。

Abstract: The effectiveness of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) prompting is often
limited by the use of randomly or manually selected examples. These examples
fail to account for both model-specific knowledge distributions and the
intrinsic complexity of the tasks, resulting in suboptimal and unstable model
performance. To address this, we propose a novel framework inspired by the
pedagogical principle of "tailored teaching with balanced difficulty". We
reframe prompt selection as a prompt curriculum design problem: constructing a
well ordered set of training examples that align with the model's current
capabilities. Our approach integrates two complementary signals: (1)
model-perceived difficulty, quantified through prediction disagreement in an
active learning setup, capturing what the model itself finds challenging; and
(2) intrinsic sample complexity, which measures the inherent difficulty of each
question-image pair independently of any model. By jointly analyzing these
signals, we develop a difficulty-balanced sampling strategy that ensures the
selected prompt examples are diverse across both dimensions. Extensive
experiments conducted on five challenging benchmarks and multiple popular
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate that our method yields
substantial and consistent improvements and greatly reduces performance
discrepancies caused by random sampling, providing a principled and robust
approach for enhancing multimodal reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现当前医学视觉-语言模型在语义等价的医学问题重述下答案波动很大，这在高风险医学应用中存在严重风险

Method: 构建包含14.4万个问题的RoMed数据集，提出一种结合知识锚定一致性学习和偏见感知对比学习的CCL方法

Result: 在三个普通VQA测试集上达到最高水平，在RoMed测试集上将答案一致性提升了50%

Conclusion: CCL方法能够有效提升医学视觉-语言模型的稳健性和可靠性，为高风险医学应用提供了更可靠的解决方案

Abstract: In high-stakes medical applications, consistent answering across diverse
question phrasings is essential for reliable diagnosis. However, we reveal that
current Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) exhibit concerning fragility
in Medical Visual Question Answering, as their answers fluctuate significantly
when faced with semantically equivalent rephrasings of medical questions. We
attribute this to two limitations: (1) insufficient alignment of medical
concepts, leading to divergent reasoning patterns, and (2) hidden biases in
training data that prioritize syntactic shortcuts over semantic understanding.
To address these challenges, we construct RoMed, a dataset built upon original
VQA datasets containing 144k questions with variations spanning word-level,
sentence-level, and semantic-level perturbations. When evaluating
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models like LLaVA-Med on RoMed, we observe alarming
performance drops (e.g., a 40\% decline in Recall) compared to original VQA
benchmarks, exposing critical robustness gaps. To bridge this gap, we propose
Consistency and Contrastive Learning (CCL), which integrates two key
components: (1) knowledge-anchored consistency learning, aligning Med-VLMs with
medical knowledge rather than shallow feature patterns, and (2) bias-aware
contrastive learning, mitigating data-specific priors through discriminative
representation refinement. CCL achieves SOTA performance on three popular VQA
benchmarks and notably improves answer consistency by 50\% on the challenging
RoMed test set, demonstrating significantly enhanced robustness. Code will be
released.

TL;DR: 提出了Attention2Probability方法，通过注意力权重转换和课程学习来提升语音大模型中专业术语的识别准确率，在中文和英文测试中分别达到92.57%和86.83%的召回率，延迟仅8.71ms。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音大模型在通用领域表现良好，但在处理领域特定术语和新词时准确率不足，需要专门的方法来提升术语识别能力。

Method: 提出Attention2Probability方法，将语音与术语之间的交叉注意力权重转换为存在概率，并采用课程学习增强检索准确性。同时创建了包含术语的语音数据集。

Result: 在测试集上显著优于VectorDB方法，中文最大召回率92.57%，英文86.83%，延迟仅8.71ms。术语干预使识别和翻译任务的准确率提升6-17%。

Conclusion: 该方法轻量、灵活且准确，有效提升了语音大模型的术语处理能力，但当前模型对术语的利用仍存在局限性。

Abstract: Recent advances in speech large language models (SLMs) have improved speech
recognition and translation in general domains, but accurately generating
domain-specific terms or neologisms remains challenging. To address this, we
propose Attention2Probability: attention-driven terminology probability
estimation for robust speech-to-text system, which is lightweight, flexible,
and accurate. Attention2Probability converts cross-attention weights between
speech and terminology into presence probabilities, and it further employs
curriculum learning to enhance retrieval accuracy. Furthermore, to tackle the
lack of data for speech-to-text tasks with terminology intervention, we create
and release a new speech dataset with terminology to support future research in
this area. Experimental results show that Attention2Probability significantly
outperforms the VectorDB method on our test set. Specifically, its maximum
recall rates reach 92.57% for Chinese and 86.83% for English. This high recall
is achieved with a latency of only 8.71ms per query. Intervening in SLMs'
recognition and translation tasks using Attention2Probability-retrieved terms
improves terminology accuracy by 6-17%, while revealing that the current
utilization of terminology by SLMs has limitations.

TL;DR: 提出了自适应原创性过滤(AOF)提示框架，通过余弦相似度过滤和词汇新颖性约束，提升多语言谜语生成的创造性和文化适应性，在GPT-4o上显著提高了词汇多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言谜语生成中LLMs倾向于重复记忆的谜语或进行浅层改写的问题，需要在文化流畅性和创造性抽象之间取得平衡。

Method: 引入自适应原创性过滤(AOF)框架，使用基于余弦相似度的拒绝机制过滤冗余生成，同时强制词汇新颖性和跨语言保真度。

Result: 在三个LLM和四个语言对的评估中，AOF增强的GPT-4o在日语上达到0.177 Self-BLEU和0.915 Distinct-2，表明词汇多样性显著提升，冗余减少。

Conclusion: 语义拒绝机制可以在无需任务特定微调的情况下，指导具有文化根基的创造性生成。

Abstract: Multilingual riddle generation challenges large language models (LLMs) to
balance cultural fluency with creative abstraction. Standard prompting
strategies -- zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought -- tend to reuse memorized
riddles or perform shallow paraphrasing. We introduce Adaptive Originality
Filtering (AOF), a prompting framework that filters redundant generations using
cosine-based similarity rejection, while enforcing lexical novelty and
cross-lingual fidelity. Evaluated across three LLMs and four language pairs,
AOF-enhanced GPT-4o achieves \texttt{0.177} Self-BLEU and \texttt{0.915}
Distinct-2 in Japanese, signaling improved lexical diversity and reduced
redundancy compared to other prompting methods and language pairs. Our findings
show that semantic rejection can guide culturally grounded, creative generation
without task-specific fine-tuning.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在客户服务中的快速应用带来了新的风险，恶意行为者可能利用机器生成文本来进行大规模用户冒充。现有检测方法在在线对话场景中表现不佳，缺乏可靠性和可解释性，而客户服务场景中的操作人员通常是非专家用户，需要可解释的检测结果来建立信任。

Method: 提出了EMMM（Explanation-then-Detection）框架，采用先解释后检测的方法，在保持低延迟的同时提供非专家用户可理解的解释。

Result: 实验结果显示，EMMM能够为非专家用户提供可理解的解释，70%的人类评估者更偏好其输出结果，同时达到了与最先进模型相竞争的准确率，并在1秒内生成输出，保持了低延迟。

Conclusion: EMMM框架在客户服务场景中成功平衡了延迟、准确性和可解释性，为非专家用户提供了可信赖的机器生成文本检测解决方案，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in customer service
introduces new risks, as malicious actors can exploit them to conduct
large-scale user impersonation through machine-generated text (MGT). Current
MGT detection methods often struggle in online conversational settings,
reducing the reliability and interpretability essential for trustworthy AI
deployment. In customer service scenarios where operators are typically
non-expert users, explanation become crucial for trustworthy MGT detection. In
this paper, we propose EMMM, an explanation-then-detection framework that
balances latency, accuracy, and non-expert-oriented interpretability.
Experimental results demonstrate that EMMM provides explanations accessible to
non-expert users, with 70\% of human evaluators preferring its outputs, while
achieving competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models and
maintaining low latency, generating outputs within 1 second. Our code and

Motivation: 当前广告标题生成方法主要优化质量或点击率，忽视了多样性需求，导致输出同质化严重，无法满足不同受众群体的需求。

Method: 设计了语义和风格感知的数据生成管道，自动产生高质量训练对；提出多阶段多目标优化框架，结合监督微调和强化学习，在单次前向传播中生成高质量多样化标题。

Conclusion: DIVER框架成功解决了广告标题生成中质量与多样性的平衡问题，为大规模广告平台提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The generation of ad headlines plays a vital role in modern advertising,
where both quality and diversity are essential to engage a broad range of
audience segments. Current approaches primarily optimize language models for
headline quality or click-through rates (CTR), often overlooking the need for
diversity and resulting in homogeneous outputs. To address this limitation, we
propose DIVER, a novel framework based on large language models (LLMs) that are
jointly optimized for both diversity and quality. We first design a semantic-
and stylistic-aware data generation pipeline that automatically produces
high-quality training pairs with ad content and multiple diverse headlines. To
achieve the goal of generating high-quality and diversified ad headlines within
a single forward pass, we propose a multi-stage multi-objective optimization
framework with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL).
Experiments on real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that DIVER
effectively balances quality and diversity. Deployed on a large-scale
content-sharing platform serving hundreds of millions of users, our framework
improves advertiser value (ADVV) and CTR by 4.0% and 1.4%.

Motivation: 多模态对话中的情感原因三元组提取(MECTEC)领域缺乏多样化数据集，现有方法未能显式建模情感和因果上下文，且忽略了不同层次语义信息的融合，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出M3HG模型，通过多模态异构图显式捕获情感和因果上下文，并在话语间和话语内层次有效融合上下文信息。

Result: 大量实验证明M3HG相比现有最先进方法具有更好的效果。

Conclusion: M3HG模型和MECAD数据集为多模态情感原因三元组提取领域提供了有效的解决方案，解决了数据集稀缺和上下文建模不足的问题。

Abstract: Emotion Cause Triplet Extraction in Multimodal Conversations (MECTEC) has
recently gained significant attention in social media analysis, aiming to
extract emotion utterances, cause utterances, and emotion categories
simultaneously. However, the scarcity of related datasets, with only one
published dataset featuring highly uniform dialogue scenarios, hinders model
development in this field. To address this, we introduce MECAD, the first
multimodal, multi-scenario MECTEC dataset, comprising 989 conversations from 56
TV series spanning a wide range of dialogue contexts. In addition, existing
MECTEC methods fail to explicitly model emotional and causal contexts and
neglect the fusion of semantic information at different levels, leading to
performance degradation. In this paper, we propose M3HG, a novel model that
explicitly captures emotional and causal contexts and effectively fuses
contextual information at both inter- and intra-utterance levels via a
multimodal heterogeneous graph. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of M3HG compared with existing state-of-the-art methods. The
codes and dataset are available at https://github.com/redifinition/M3HG.

TL;DR: ChronoRAG是一个专门针对叙事文本的新型RAG框架，通过重构连贯段落和保持时间顺序来改善长上下文问答性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法在处理叙事文本时效果有限，因为叙事理解需要更广泛的上下文和段落间的时序关系，而不仅仅是孤立片段

Method: 提出ChronoRAG框架，专注于两个关键方面：将分散的文档信息重构为连贯的结构化段落，以及通过显式捕获和维护检索段落的时间顺序来保持叙事流程

Result: 在NarrativeQA数据集上的实验显示，ChronoRAG在需要事实识别和复杂时序关系理解的任务中取得了显著改进

Conclusion: 时序推理对于解决叙事问答任务至关重要，ChronoRAG通过专门处理叙事文本的时序特性有效提升了性能

Abstract: Long-context question answering over narrative tasks is challenging because
correct answers often hinge on reconstructing a coherent timeline of events
while preserving contextual flow in a limited context window.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) indexing methods aim to address this
challenge by selectively retrieving only necessary document segments. However,
narrative texts possess unique characteristics that limit the effectiveness of
these existing approaches. Specifically, understanding narrative texts requires
more than isolated segments, as the broader context and sequential
relationships between segments are crucial for comprehension. To address these
limitations, we propose ChronoRAG, a novel RAG framework specialized for
narrative texts. This approach focuses on two essential aspects: refining
dispersed document information into coherent and structured passages, and
preserving narrative flow by explicitly capturing and maintaining the temporal
order among retrieved passages. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of
ChronoRAG through experiments on the NarrativeQA dataset, showing substantial
improvements in tasks requiring both factual identification and comprehension
of complex sequential relationships, underscoring that reasoning over temporal
order is crucial in resolving narrative QA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然具备强大的推理能力，但计算成本控制仍是实际部署的重大挑战。开源社区缺乏像GPT-oss那样的可控推理能力，需要开发开源解决方案。

Method: 采用端到端训练范式：预算模式监督微调将可控推理能力嵌入学习过程，以及两阶段预算感知强化学习与自适应奖励塑造。

Conclusion: ThinkDial成功实现了目标压缩-性能权衡，在显著减少响应长度的同时保持性能阈值，为开源社区提供了可控推理的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought reasoning have
demonstrated remarkable problem-solving capabilities, but controlling their
computational effort remains a significant challenge for practical deployment.
Recent proprietary systems like OpenAI's gpt-oss series have introduced
discrete operational modes for intuitive reasoning control, but the open-source
community has largely failed to achieve such capabilities. In this paper, we
introduce ThinkDial, the first open-recipe end-to-end framework that
successfully implements gpt-oss-style controllable reasoning through discrete
operational modes. Our system enables seamless switching between three distinct
reasoning regimes: High mode (full reasoning capability), Medium mode (50
percent token reduction with <10 percent performance degradation), and Low mode
(75 percent token reduction with <15 percent performance degradation). We
achieve this through an end-to-end training paradigm that integrates
budget-mode control throughout the entire pipeline: budget-mode supervised
fine-tuning that embeds controllable reasoning capabilities directly into the
learning process, and two-phase budget-aware reinforcement learning with
adaptive reward shaping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ThinkDial
achieves target compression-performance trade-offs with clear response length
reductions while maintaining performance thresholds. The framework also
exhibits strong generalization capabilities on out-of-distribution tasks.

Conclusion: 使用强化学习引导大语言模型具有明显优势，为语法纠错任务的未来发展提供了更可控和可靠的范式

Abstract: Grammatical error correction is a significant task in NLP. Traditional
methods based on encoder-decoder models have achieved certain success, but the
application of LLMs in this field is still underexplored. Current research
predominantly relies on supervised fine-tuning to train LLMs to directly
generate the corrected sentence, which limits the model's powerful reasoning
ability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework based on
Rule-Based RL. Through experiments on the Chinese datasets, our Rule-Based RL
framework achieves \textbf{state-of-the-art }performance, with a notable
increase in \textbf{recall}. This result clearly highlights the advantages of
using RL to steer LLMs, offering a more controllable and reliable paradigm for
future development in GEC.

Abstract: Conversational analytics has been on the forefront of transformation driven
by the advances in Speech and Natural Language Processing techniques. Rapid
adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the analytics field has taken the
problems that can be automated to a new level of complexity and scale. In this
paper, we introduce Theme Detection as a critical task in conversational
analytics, aimed at automatically identifying and categorizing topics within
conversations. This process can significantly reduce the manual effort involved
in analyzing expansive dialogs, particularly in domains like customer support
or sales. Unlike traditional dialog intent detection, which often relies on a
fixed set of intents for downstream system logic, themes are intended as a
direct, user-facing summary of the conversation's core inquiry. This
distinction allows for greater flexibility in theme surface forms and
user-specific customizations. We pose Controllable Conversational Theme
Detection problem as a public competition track at Dialog System Technology
Challenge (DSTC) 12 -- it is framed as joint clustering and theme labeling of
dialog utterances, with the distinctive aspect being controllability of the
resulting theme clusters' granularity achieved via the provided user preference
data. We give an overview of the problem, the associated dataset and the
evaluation metrics, both automatic and human. Finally, we discuss the
participant teams' submissions and provide insights from those. The track
materials (data and code) are openly available in the GitHub repository.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of modern machine translation (MT) systems on
general-domain texts, translating structured LaTeX-formatted documents remains
a significant challenge. These documents typically interleave natural language
with domain-specific syntax, such as mathematical equations, tables, figures,
and cross-references, all of which must be accurately preserved to maintain
semantic integrity and compilability. In this paper, we introduce LaTeXTrans, a
collaborative multi-agent system designed to address this challenge. LaTeXTrans
ensures format preservation, structural fidelity, and terminology consistency
through six specialized agents: 1) a Parser that decomposes LaTeX into
translation-friendly units via placeholder substitution and syntax filtering;
2) a Translator, Validator, Summarizer, and Terminology Extractor that work
collaboratively to ensure context-aware, self-correcting, and
terminology-consistent translations; 3) a Generator that reconstructs the
translated content into well-structured LaTeX documents. Experimental results
demonstrate that LaTeXTrans can outperform mainstream MT systems in both
translation accuracy and structural fidelity, offering an effective and
practical solution for translating LaTeX-formatted documents.

Conclusion: 该研究提出的结合语义和传播动态的自监督框架有效解决了虚假信息检测中的关键挑战，为资源受限环境下的部署提供了可行方案

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation in the digital age has led to significant
societal challenges. Existing approaches often struggle with capturing
long-range dependencies, complex semantic relations, and the social dynamics
influencing news dissemination. Furthermore, these methods require extensive
labelled datasets, making their deployment resource-intensive. In this study,
we propose a novel self-supervised misinformation detection framework that
integrates both complex semantic relations using Abstract Meaning
Representation (AMR) and news propagation dynamics. We introduce an LLM-based
graph contrastive loss (LGCL) that utilizes negative anchor points generated by
a Large Language Model (LLM) to enhance feature separability in a zero-shot
manner. To incorporate social context, we employ a multi view graph masked
autoencoder, which learns news propagation features from social context graph.
By combining these semantic and propagation-based features, our approach
effectively differentiates between fake and real news in a self-supervised
manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our self-supervised framework
achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art methodologies,
even with limited labelled datasets while improving generalizability.

systems and domain-specific tools to create executable programs. These programs
are then translated into natural language problem-solution pairs and vetted by
a bilateral validation mechanism that verifies solution correctness against
program outputs and ensures program-problem consistency. We have generated 12.3

fine-tuned on our data significantly improve their inference capabilities,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets and
showcasing the effectiveness of our synthesis approach.

Method: 提出ConfTuner微调方法，使用理论证明为proper scoring rule的tokenized Brier score损失函数，无需真实置信度分数或代理置信度估计。

Conclusion: 该方法推进了可信LLM系统的发展，通过简单高效的微调方法有效解决了LLM过度自信问题，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains
such as science, law, and healthcare, where accurate expressions of uncertainty
are essential for reliability and trust. However, current LLMs are often
observed to generate incorrect answers with high confidence, a phenomenon known
as "overconfidence". Recent efforts have focused on calibrating LLMs'
verbalized confidence: i.e., their expressions of confidence in text form, such
as "I am 80% confident that...". Existing approaches either rely on prompt
engineering or fine-tuning with heuristically generated uncertainty estimates,
both of which have limited effectiveness and generalizability. Motivated by the
notion of proper scoring rules for calibration in classical machine learning
models, we introduce ConfTuner, a simple and efficient fine-tuning method that
introduces minimal overhead and does not require ground-truth confidence scores
or proxy confidence estimates. ConfTuner relies on a new loss function,
tokenized Brier score, which we theoretically prove to be a proper scoring
rule, intuitively meaning that it "correctly incentivizes the model to report
its true probability of being correct". ConfTuner improves calibration across
diverse reasoning tasks and generalizes to black-box models such as GPT-4o. Our
results further show that better-calibrated confidence enables downstream gains
in self-correction and model cascade, advancing the development of trustworthy
LLM systems. The code is available at

Conclusion: ReflectivePrompt成为进化算法基自动提示中最有效的解决方案之一，通过反射操作显著提升了提示优化的精确性和全面性

Abstract: Autoprompting is the process of automatically selecting optimized prompts for
language models, which has been gaining popularity with the rapid advancement
of prompt engineering, driven by extensive research in the field of large
language models (LLMs). This paper presents ReflectivePrompt - a novel
autoprompting method based on evolutionary algorithms that employs a reflective
evolution approach for more precise and comprehensive search of optimal
prompts. ReflectivePrompt utilizes short-term and long-term reflection
operations before crossover and elitist mutation to enhance the quality of the
modifications they introduce. This method allows for the accumulation of
knowledge obtained throughout the evolution process and updates it at each
epoch based on the current population. ReflectivePrompt was tested on 33
datasets for classification and text generation tasks using open-access large
language models: t-lite-instruct-0.1 and gemma3-27b-it. The method
demonstrates, on average, a significant improvement (e.g., 28% on BBH compared
to EvoPrompt) in metrics relative to current state-of-the-art approaches,
thereby establishing itself as one of the most effective solutions in
evolutionary algorithm-based autoprompting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算教育研究(CER)中，研究者常常缺乏资源进行大规模严谨研究，需要能够处理大量定性数据而不增加研究负担的方法。

Method: 提出LLM辅助内容分析(LACA)方法，结合内容分析和大型语言模型，使研究者能够进行原本无法完成的大规模文本数据分析。

Result: 通过计算教育数据集展示了LACA方法的应用，证明该方法具有可重复性和严谨性。

Conclusion: LACA方法在CER领域具有重要潜力，能够从更广泛的研究中得出更具普适性的发现，有助于提升CER学科的研究质量和实践水平。

Abstract: Computing education research (CER) is often instigated by practitioners
wanting to improve both their own and the wider discipline's teaching practice.
However, the latter is often difficult as many researchers lack the colleagues,
resources, or capacity to conduct research that is generalisable or rigorous
enough to advance the discipline. As a result, research methods that enable
sense-making with larger volumes of qualitative data, while not increasing the
burden on the researcher, have significant potential within CER.
  In this discussion paper, we propose such a method for conducting rigorous
analysis on large volumes of textual data, namely a variation of LLM-assisted
content analysis (LACA). This method combines content analysis with the use of
large language models, empowering researchers to conduct larger-scale research
which they would otherwise not be able to perform. Using a computing education
dataset, we illustrate how LACA could be applied in a reproducible and rigorous
manner. We believe this method has potential in CER, enabling more
generalisable findings from a wider range of research. This, together with the
development of similar methods, can help to advance both the practice and
research quality of the CER discipline.

Motivation: 研究情感极化（对对立群体表现出负面情绪和敌意）在欧洲议会中的存在情况，这种极化已成为全球政治话语的显著特征

Method: 利用六个欧洲国家议会的完整演讲语料库，采用自然语言处理技术估计议员情感，通过比较对反对派和己方成员的负面情绪水平来识别情感极化模式

Result: 在所有六个欧洲议会中都发现了一致的情感极化现象；活动水平与负面情绪相关，但活跃和不活跃议员的情感极化程度没有差异；互惠机制是议会间情感极化的促成因素

Conclusion: 欧洲议会普遍存在情感极化，这种极化现象具有跨国家一致性，且通过互惠机制在议员之间传播，与议员的活动水平无关

Abstract: Affective polarization, characterized by increased negativity and hostility
towards opposing groups, has become a prominent feature of political discourse
worldwide. Our study examines the presence of this type of polarization in a
selection of European parliaments in a fully automated manner. Utilizing a
comprehensive corpus of parliamentary speeches from the parliaments of six
European countries, we employ natural language processing techniques to
estimate parliamentarian sentiment. By comparing the levels of negativity
conveyed in references to individuals from opposing groups versus one's own, we
discover patterns of affectively polarized interactions. The findings
demonstrate the existence of consistent affective polarization across all six
European parliaments. Although activity correlates with negativity, there is no
observed difference in affective polarization between less active and more
active members of parliament. Finally, we show that reciprocity is a
contributing mechanism in affective polarization between parliamentarians
across all six parliaments.

Conclusion: 这项工作为更安全、更全面的RAG系统评估提供了实用且符合伦理的途径，为未来符合AI法规和合规标准的改进奠定了基础

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems improve large language model
outputs by incorporating external knowledge, enabling more informed and
context-aware responses. However, the effectiveness and trustworthiness of
these systems critically depends on how they are evaluated, particularly on
whether the evaluation process captures real-world constraints like protecting
sensitive information. While current evaluation efforts for RAG systems have
primarily focused on the development of performance metrics, far less attention
has been given to the design and quality of the underlying evaluation datasets,
despite their pivotal role in enabling meaningful, reliable assessments. In
this work, we introduce a novel multi-agent framework for generating synthetic
QA datasets for RAG evaluation that prioritize semantic diversity and privacy
preservation. Our approach involves: (1) a Diversity agent leveraging
clustering techniques to maximize topical coverage and semantic variability,
(2) a Privacy Agent that detects and mask sensitive information across multiple
domains and (3) a QA curation agent that synthesizes private and diverse QA
pairs suitable as ground truth for RAG evaluation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our evaluation sets outperform baseline methods in diversity
and achieve robust privacy masking on domain-specific datasets. This work
offers a practical and ethically aligned pathway toward safer, more
comprehensive RAG system evaluation, laying the foundation for future
enhancements aligned with evolving AI regulations and compliance standards.

Abstract: We present a framework where neural models develop an AI Mother Tongue, a
native symbolic language that simultaneously supports intuitive reasoning,
compositional symbol chains, and inherent interpretability. Unlike post-hoc
explanation methods, our approach embeds reasoning directly into the model's
representations: symbols capture meaningful semantic patterns, chains trace
decision paths, and gated induction mechanisms guide selective focus, yielding
transparent yet flexible reasoning. We introduce complementary training
objectives to enhance symbol purity and decision sparsity, and employ a
sequential specialization strategy to first build broad symbolic competence and
then refine intuitive judgments. Experiments on AI tasks demonstrate
competitive accuracy alongside verifiable reasoning traces, showing that AI
Mother Tongue can serve as a unified mechanism for interpretability, intuition,
and symbolic reasoning in neural models.

Unlike existing datasets that focus on surface-level comprehension, MovieCORE
emphasizes questions that engage System-2 thinking while remaining specific to

scheme for assessing VQA model performance on deeper cognitive tasks. To
address the limitations of existing video-language models (VLMs), we introduce
an agentic enhancement module, Agentic Choice Enhancement (ACE), which improves

Motivation: 现有LLM智能体在复杂长时程规划任务中缺乏宏观指导，容易迷失方向，且执行过程中缺乏持续监督，导致无法适应环境变化和容易偏离目标。

Method: HiPlan采用分层规划框架：离线阶段从专家演示构建里程碑库实现结构化经验复用；执行阶段动态适配轨迹片段生成步骤提示，将当前观察与里程碑目标对齐。

Conclusion: HiPlan通过自适应全局-局部指导有效解决了LLM智能体在复杂规划任务中的迷失和偏离问题，为LLM智能体的决策能力提供了重要提升。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in decision-making tasks, but struggle significantly with complex,
long-horizon planning scenarios. This arises from their lack of macroscopic
guidance, causing disorientation and failures in complex tasks, as well as
insufficient continuous oversight during execution, rendering them unresponsive
to environmental changes and prone to deviations. To tackle these challenges,
we introduce HiPlan, a hierarchical planning framework that provides adaptive
global-local guidance to boost LLM-based agents'decision-making. HiPlan
decomposes complex tasks into milestone action guides for general direction and
step-wise hints for detailed actions. During the offline phase, we construct a
milestone library from expert demonstrations, enabling structured experience
reuse by retrieving semantically similar tasks and milestones. In the execution
phase, trajectory segments from past milestones are dynamically adapted to
generate step-wise hints that align current observations with the milestone
objectives, bridging gaps and correcting deviations. Extensive experiments
across two challenging benchmarks demonstrate that HiPlan substantially
outperforms strong baselines, and ablation studies validate the complementary
benefits of its hierarchical components.

Abstract: In a doctor-patient dialogue, the primary objective of physicians is to
diagnose patients and propose a treatment plan. Medical doctors guide these
conversations through targeted questioning to efficiently gather the
information required to provide the best possible outcomes for patients. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies physician intent
trajectories in doctor-patient dialogues. We use the `Ambient Clinical
Intelligence Benchmark' (Aci-bench) dataset for our study. We collaborate with
medical professionals to develop a fine-grained taxonomy of physician intents
based on the SOAP framework (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan). We
then conduct a large-scale annotation effort to label over 5000 doctor-patient
turns with the help of a large number of medical experts recruited using
Prolific, a popular crowd-sourcing platform. This large labeled dataset is an
important resource contribution that we use for benchmarking the
state-of-the-art generative and encoder models for medical intent
classification tasks. Our findings show that our models understand the general
structure of medical dialogues with high accuracy, but often fail to identify
transitions between SOAP categories. We also report for the first time common
trajectories in medical dialogue structures that provide valuable insights for
designing `differential diagnosis' systems. Finally, we extensively study the
impact of intent filtering for medical dialogue summarization and observe a
significant boost in performance. We make the codes and data, including
annotation guidelines, publicly available at

### [44] [It's All About In-Context Learning! Teaching Extremely Low-Resource Languages to LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19089)
*Yue Li,Zhixue Zhao,Carolina Scarton*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次全面分析了大语言模型能否通过上下文学习掌握极低资源语言，比较了上下文学习与参数高效微调的效果，发现零样本上下文学习结合语言对齐对极低资源语言特别有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极低资源语言，特别是使用罕见文字的语言，在大语言模型中缺乏支持。这主要是由于训练数据匮乏等复合因素造成的。

Method: 系统评估了20种代表性不足的语言，在三个最先进的多语言大语言模型上测试了上下文学习（有/无辅助对齐信号）与参数高效微调方法的对比。

Result: 研究发现当语言及其文字都极低代表性时，参数高效微调存在局限性。零样本上下文学习结合语言对齐对极低资源语言效果显著，而少样本上下文学习或参数高效微调对相对较好表示的语言更有效。

Conclusion: 为从事极低资源语言工作的LLM从业者提供了基于结果的指导原则，例如避免在未见过的文字语言上微调多语言模型。

Abstract: Extremely low-resource languages, especially those written in rare scripts,
as shown in Figure 1, remain largely unsupported by large language models
(LLMs). This is due in part to compounding factors such as the lack of training
data. This paper delivers the first comprehensive analysis of whether LLMs can
acquire such languages purely via in-context learning (ICL), with or without
auxiliary alignment signals, and how these methods compare to
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We systematically evaluate 20
under-represented languages across three state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs.
Our findings highlight the limitation of PEFT when both language and its script
are extremely under-represented by the LLM. In contrast, zero-shot ICL with
language alignment is impressively effective on extremely low-resource
languages, while few-shot ICL or PEFT is more beneficial for languages
relatively better represented by LLMs. For LLM practitioners working on
extremely low-resource languages, we summarise guidelines grounded by our
results on adapting LLMs to low-resource languages, e.g., avoiding fine-tuning
a multilingual model on languages of unseen scripts.

*Mathew Henrickson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一个基于检索增强生成(RAG)的艺术品溯源研究框架，专注于Getty溯源索引，通过语义检索和上下文摘要实现自然语言和多语言搜索，解决了艺术品溯源研究中碎片化多语言档案数据的检索难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 艺术品溯源研究对于验证真伪、支持归还和法律主张、理解文化历史背景至关重要，但当前搜索门户需要精确元数据，限制了探索性搜索，且多语言碎片化档案数据阻碍了高效检索。

Method: 采用检索增强生成(RAG)框架，结合语义检索和上下文摘要技术，使用Getty溯源索引-德国拍卖记录的10,000条样本数据进行评估，实现自然语言和多语言搜索功能。

Result: 结果显示该方法能够有效检索和总结拍卖记录，为艺术品市场档案导航提供了可扩展的解决方案，降低了对元数据结构的依赖。

Conclusion: 该RAG框架为历史学家和文化遗产专业人士进行历史敏感性研究提供了实用工具，显著改善了艺术品溯源研究的效率和效果。

Abstract: This research presents a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for
art provenance studies, focusing on the Getty Provenance Index. Provenance
research establishes the ownership history of artworks, which is essential for
verifying authenticity, supporting restitution and legal claims, and
understanding the cultural and historical context of art objects. The process
is complicated by fragmented, multilingual archival data that hinders efficient
retrieval. Current search portals require precise metadata, limiting
exploratory searches. Our method enables natural-language and multilingual
searches through semantic retrieval and contextual summarization, reducing
dependence on metadata structures. We assess RAG's capability to retrieve and
summarize auction records using a 10,000-record sample from the Getty
Provenance Index - German Sales. The results show this approach provides a
scalable solution for navigating art market archives, offering a practical tool
for historians and cultural heritage professionals conducting historically
sensitive research.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种混合透明的定量话语分析框架，结合词汇和语义方法，以解决对黑盒软件的依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前定量话语分析对MAXQDA和NVivo等黑盒软件的依赖颠印了方法论透明度和研究目标的一致性。

Method: 使用Python自定义流水线（NLTK、spaCy、Sentence Transformers）进行精细控制的预处理、词形恢复和向量化，通过BERTopic模型进行迭代分析，包括UMAP降维、HDBSCAN聚类和c-TF-IDF关键词提取。

Result: 通过历史政治话语案例研究，展示了该框架能够实现三角测量、可复现性和可解释性，同时缓解了单纯方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 研究强调代码层面的透明性、研究人员的主动性以及方法论三角测量在计算话语研究中的重要性，并提供了开源代码和补充材料。

Abstract: Quantitative Discourse Analysis has seen growing adoption with the rise of
Large Language Models and computational tools. However, reliance on black box
software such as MAXQDA and NVivo risks undermining methodological transparency
and alignment with research goals. This paper presents a hybrid, transparent
framework for QDA that combines lexical and semantic methods to enable
triangulation, reproducibility, and interpretability. Drawing from a case study
in historical political discourse, we demonstrate how custom Python pipelines
using NLTK, spaCy, and Sentence Transformers allow fine-grained control over
preprocessing, lemmatisation, and embedding generation. We further detail our
iterative BERTopic modelling process, incorporating UMAP dimensionality
reduction, HDBSCAN clustering, and c-TF-IDF keyword extraction, optimised
through parameter tuning and multiple runs to enhance topic coherence and
coverage. By juxtaposing precise lexical searches with context-aware semantic
clustering, we argue for a multi-layered approach that mitigates the
limitations of either method in isolation. Our workflow underscores the
importance of code-level transparency, researcher agency, and methodological
triangulation in computational discourse studies. Code and supplementary
materials are available via GitHub.

*Zhikai Ding,Shiyu Ni,Keping Bi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型视觉语言模型对知识边界的感知能力，发现概率置信度和一致性置信度更可靠，而语言化置信度容易过度自信，并提出了改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在视觉问答任务中存在幻觉问题，需要可靠地感知自身知识边界（知道什么知道、什么不知道），以确保模型可靠性。

Method: 通过评估三种置信信号（概率置信度、答案一致性置信度、语言化置信度），在三个LVLM模型和三个VQA数据集上进行实验，并采用LLM的置信度校准方法进行改进。

Result: LVLMs具有一定程度的感知能力但仍有很大改进空间。概率和一致性信号更可靠，语言化置信度常导致过度自信。视觉和文本联合处理降低了问答性能但提高了感知水平。

Conclusion: LVLMs的知识边界感知能力需要进一步提升，提出的校准方法有效，多模态处理虽然降低性能但改善了感知可靠性。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong visual question
answering (VQA) capabilities but are shown to hallucinate. A reliable model
should perceive its knowledge boundaries-knowing what it knows and what it does
not. This paper investigates LVLMs' perception of their knowledge boundaries by
evaluating three types of confidence signals: probabilistic confidence, answer
consistency-based confidence, and verbalized confidence. Experiments on three
LVLMs across three VQA datasets show that, although LVLMs possess a reasonable
perception level, there is substantial room for improvement. Among the three
confidences, probabilistic and consistency-based signals are more reliable
indicators, while verbalized confidence often leads to overconfidence. To
enhance LVLMs' perception, we adapt several established confidence calibration
methods from Large Language Models (LLMs) and propose three effective methods.
Additionally, we compare LVLMs with their LLM counterparts, finding that
jointly processing visual and textual inputs decreases question-answering
performance but reduces confidence, resulting in an improved perception level
compared to LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏全面的科学推理评测基准，且很少系统性地分析知识与推理在科学任务中的不同作用。

Method: 引入SciReas评测套件和SciReas-Pro子集，提出KRUX探测框架来分离知识与推理的作用，并进行深入分析。

Result: 发现知识检索是关键瓶颈，外部知识和推理增强能提升性能，推理增强有助于提取任务相关知识。

Conclusion: 提出了全面的科学推理评测框架和强基线模型，为LLM科学推理能力研究提供了重要工具和见解。

Abstract: Scientific problem solving poses unique challenges for LLMs, requiring both
deep domain knowledge and the ability to apply such knowledge through complex
reasoning. While automated scientific reasoners hold great promise for
assisting human scientists, there is currently no widely adopted holistic
benchmark for evaluating scientific reasoning, and few approaches
systematically disentangle the distinct roles of knowledge and reasoning in
these tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce SciReas, a diverse suite of
existing benchmarks for scientific reasoning tasks, and SciReas-Pro, a
selective subset that requires more complex reasoning. Our holistic evaluation
surfaces insights about scientific reasoning performance that remain hidden
when relying on individual benchmarks alone. We then propose KRUX, a probing
framework for studying the distinct roles of reasoning and knowledge in
scientific tasks. Combining the two, we conduct an in-depth analysis that
yields several key findings: (1) Retrieving task-relevant knowledge from model
parameters is a critical bottleneck for LLMs in scientific reasoning; (2)
Reasoning models consistently benefit from external knowledge added in-context
on top of the reasoning enhancement; (3) Enhancing verbalized reasoning
improves LLMs' ability to surface task-relevant knowledge. Finally, we conduct
a lightweight analysis, comparing our science-focused data composition with
concurrent efforts on long CoT SFT, and release SciLit01, a strong 8B baseline
for scientific reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语音合成模型在处理长序列多说话人对话时面临计算效率和数据压缩的挑战，需要一种能够保持音频保真度同时显著提升处理长序列效率的方法。

Method: 采用next-token diffusion方法，通过自回归生成潜在向量来建模连续数据；引入新型连续语音分词器，相比Encodec模型实现80倍数据压缩；支持64K上下文窗口长度，最多处理4个说话人。

Result: 模型能够合成长达90分钟的长语音，保持音频保真度，在计算效率上有显著提升，超越了开源和专有对话模型的性能。

Conclusion: VibeVoice通过创新的分词器和扩散方法，成功解决了长序列多说话人语音合成的挑战，在保持音质的同时大幅提升了处理效率，为长语音合成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This report presents VibeVoice, a novel model designed to synthesize
long-form speech with multiple speakers by employing next-token diffusion,
which is a unified method for modeling continuous data by autoregressively
generating latent vectors via diffusion. To enable this, we introduce a novel
continuous speech tokenizer that, when compared to the popular Encodec model,
improves data compression by 80 times while maintaining comparable performance.
The tokenizer effectively preserves audio fidelity while significantly boosting
computational efficiency for processing long sequences. Thus, VibeVoice can
synthesize long-form speech for up to 90 minutes (in a 64K context window
length) with a maximum of 4 speakers, capturing the authentic conversational
``vibe'' and surpassing open-source and proprietary dialogue models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究发现传统可读性指标在平易语言摘要评估中与人类判断相关性差，而语言模型能更好地评估可读性，特别是对背景知识等深层因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前平易语言摘要领域使用传统可读性指标（如FKGL）作为标准，但这些指标在PLA领域尚未与人类可读性判断进行系统比较。

Method: 评估8种传统可读性指标与人类判断的相关性，并测试语言模型作为可读性评估工具的性能，分析PLA数据集中的深层可读性因素。

Result: 大多数传统指标与人类判断相关性差，最佳语言模型达到0.56的皮尔逊相关系数。语言模型能更好地捕捉背景知识等深层可读性维度。

Conclusion: 建议在平易语言摘要评估中使用语言模型替代传统指标，并发布了分析代码和调查数据以供后续研究。

Abstract: Plain Language Summarization (PLS) aims to distill complex documents into
accessible summaries for non-expert audiences. In this paper, we conduct a
thorough survey of PLS literature, and identify that the current standard
practice for readability evaluation is to use traditional readability metrics,
such as Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL). However, despite proven utility in
other fields, these metrics have not been compared to human readability
judgments in PLS. We evaluate 8 readability metrics and show that most
correlate poorly with human judgments, including the most popular metric, FKGL.
We then show that Language Models (LMs) are better judges of readability, with
the best-performing model achieving a Pearson correlation of 0.56 with human
judgments. Extending our analysis to PLS datasets, which contain summaries
aimed at non-expert audiences, we find that LMs better capture deeper measures
of readability, such as required background knowledge, and lead to different
conclusions than the traditional metrics. Based on these findings, we offer
recommendations for best practices in the evaluation of plain language
summaries. We release our analysis code and survey data.

TL;DR: 提出生成式界面范式，让LLM主动生成用户界面来替代传统对话式交互，在多轮、信息密集和探索性任务中显著提升用户体验


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统线性请求-响应格式的对话系统在多轮、信息密集和探索性任务中效率低下，需要更自适应和交互式的交互方式

Method: 提出生成式语言模型界面框架，利用结构化界面特定表示和迭代优化，将用户查询转换为任务特定的用户界面

Result: 生成式界面在70%以上的情况下被人类偏好，在多样化任务、交互模式和查询类型中一致优于传统对话式界面

Conclusion: 生成式界面为人类-AI交互的未来发展指明了方向，明确了用户偏好生成式界面的时机和原因

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly seen as assistants, copilots,
and consultants, capable of supporting a wide range of tasks through natural
conversation. However, most systems remain constrained by a linear
request-response format that often makes interactions inefficient in
multi-turn, information-dense, and exploratory tasks. To address these
limitations, we propose Generative Interfaces for Language Models, a paradigm
in which LLMs respond to user queries by proactively generating user interfaces
(UIs) that enable more adaptive and interactive engagement. Our framework
leverages structured interface-specific representations and iterative
refinements to translate user queries into task-specific UIs. For systematic
evaluation, we introduce a multidimensional assessment framework that compares
generative interfaces with traditional chat-based ones across diverse tasks,
interaction patterns, and query types, capturing functional, interactive, and
emotional aspects of user experience. Results show that generative interfaces
consistently outperform conversational ones, with humans preferring them in
over 70% of cases. These findings clarify when and why users favor generative
interfaces, paving the way for future advancements in human-AI interaction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了两种无需真实训练数据的水下3D目标检测方法：基于物理的声纳仿真训练神经网络和基于模板匹配的几何方法，发现在真实环境中模板匹配方法比神经网络更具鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决水下3D目标检测中真实标注数据获取困难且成本高昂的问题，探索无需真实训练数据的可靠检测方法。

Method: 开发了两种范式：1）基于物理的声纳仿真生成合成数据训练最先进神经网络；2）基于模型模板匹配系统，利用目标物体的几何先验知识。

Result: 在真实波罗的海测深数据上评估：神经网络在仿真场景达到98% mAP，但在真实声纳数据上降至40%；模板匹配方法无需训练即可在真实数据上保持83% mAP。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了水下领域数据密集型深度学习的传统观念，为数据稀缺环境下的训练免费水下3D检测建立了首个大规模基准，为自主水下航行器导航等应用开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Underwater 3D object detection remains one of the most challenging frontiers
in computer vision, where traditional approaches struggle with the harsh
acoustic environment and scarcity of training data. While deep learning has
revolutionized terrestrial 3D detection, its application underwater faces a
critical bottleneck: obtaining sufficient annotated sonar data is prohibitively
expensive and logistically complex, often requiring specialized vessels, expert
surveyors, and favorable weather conditions. This work addresses a fundamental
question: Can we achieve reliable underwater 3D object detection without
real-world training data? We tackle this challenge by developing and comparing
two paradigms for training-free detection of artificial structures in multibeam
echo-sounder point clouds. Our dual approach combines a physics-based sonar
simulation pipeline that generates synthetic training data for state-of-the-art
neural networks, with a robust model-based template matching system that
leverages geometric priors of target objects. Evaluation on real bathymetry
surveys from the Baltic Sea reveals surprising insights: while neural networks
trained on synthetic data achieve 98% mean Average Precision (mAP) on simulated
scenes, they drop to 40% mAP on real sonar data due to domain shift.
Conversely, our template matching approach maintains 83% mAP on real data
without requiring any training, demonstrating remarkable robustness to acoustic
noise and environmental variations. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom
about data-hungry deep learning in underwater domains and establish the first
large-scale benchmark for training-free underwater 3D detection. This work
opens new possibilities for autonomous underwater vehicle navigation, marine
archaeology, and offshore infrastructure monitoring in data-scarce environments
where traditional machine learning approaches fail.

TL;DR: MobileDenseAttn是一个融合MobileNetV2和DenseNet201的双流模型，用于脑肿瘤MRI检测，在6020个MRI扫描数据集上达到98.35%的测试准确率，训练时间比VGG19减少39.3%，并通过GradCAM提供可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前脑肿瘤MRI检测方法存在泛化能力有限、计算效率低、缺乏可解释性和透明度等问题，限制了临床应用的信任度。

Method: 提出MobileDenseAttn模型，融合MobileNetV2和DenseNet201的双流架构，采用特征级融合，在增强的6020个MRI扫描数据集上进行训练，使用5折交叉验证协议。

Result: 训练准确率99.75%，测试准确率98.35%，F1分数0.9835（95% CI: 0.9743-0.9920），比基线模型准确率提升+3.67%，训练时间比VGG19减少39.3%。

Conclusion: MobileDenseAttn是一个高效、高性能、可解释的模型，具有成为临床实用工具的潜力，能够提供肿瘤区域的清晰定位和临床显著性解释。

Abstract: The detection of brain tumor in MRI is an important aspect of ensuring timely
diagnostics and treatment; however, manual analysis is commonly long and
error-prone. Current approaches are not universal because they have limited
generalization to heterogeneous tumors, are computationally inefficient, are
not interpretable, and lack transparency, thus limiting trustworthiness. To
overcome these issues, we introduce MobileDenseAttn, a fusion model of dual
streams of MobileNetV2 and DenseNet201 that can help gradually improve the
feature representation scale, computing efficiency, and visual explanations via
GradCAM. Our model uses feature level fusion and is trained on an augmented
dataset of 6,020 MRI scans representing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors,
and normal samples. Measured under strict 5-fold cross-validation protocols,
MobileDenseAttn provides a training accuracy of 99.75%, a testing accuracy of
98.35%, and a stable F1 score of 0.9835 (95% CI: 0.9743 to 0.9920). The
extensive validation shows the stability of the model, and the comparative
analysis proves that it is a great advancement over the baseline models (VGG19,
DenseNet201, MobileNetV2) with a +3.67% accuracy increase and a 39.3% decrease
in training time compared to VGG19. The GradCAM heatmaps clearly show
tumor-affected areas, offering clinically significant localization and
improving interpretability. These findings position MobileDenseAttn as an
efficient, high performance, interpretable model with a high probability of
becoming a clinically practical tool in identifying brain tumors in the real
world.

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉语言模型（VLMs）存在多模态基础缺陷：当实体以视觉而非文本形式呈现时，模型回忆事实知识的能力显著下降，准确率降低一半。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别VLMs在多模态基础方面的系统性缺陷，特别是模型在视觉参考和文本参考下表现不一致的问题。

Method: 通过对照研究分析VLMs的表现差异，利用模型内部状态模式构建探测机制，无需重新训练即可识别不可靠响应。

Result: 探测机制在标记不可靠响应时达到92%以上准确率，在视觉问答任务中选择性预测可将覆盖率提高7.87%，同时降低0.9%的错误风险。

Conclusion: VLMs在将内部实体知识与图像表示链接方面存在系统性缺陷，这种缺陷是可检测的，为未来语言基础研究提供了重要方向和改进建议。

Abstract: Through a controlled study, we identify a systematic deficiency in the
multimodal grounding of Vision Language Models (VLMs). While VLMs can recall
factual associations when provided a textual reference to an entity; their
ability to do so is significantly diminished when the reference is visual
instead. Forcing VLMs to rely on image representations of an entity halves
their ability to recall factual knowledge, suggesting that VLMs struggle to
link their internal knowledge of an entity with its image representation. We
show that such linking failures are correlated with the expression of distinct
patterns in model internal states, and that probes on these internal states
achieve over 92% accuracy at flagging cases where the VLM response is
unreliable. These probes can be applied, without retraining, to identify when a
VLM will fail to correctly answer a question that requires an understanding of
multimodal input. When used to facilitate selective prediction on a visual
question answering task, the probes increase coverage by 7.87% (absolute) while
also reducing the risk of error by 0.9% (absolute). Addressing the systematic,
detectable deficiency is an important avenue in language grounding, and we
provide informed recommendations for future directions.

Result: 在DTU数据集上，相比SparseNeuS重建的倒角距离平均减少44%，相比VolRecon减少20%；作为NeuS和Neuralangelo等密集重建基线的插件时，DTU数据集上的平均误差分别减少69%和68%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了稀疏图像3D重建中的辐射模糊和形状模糊问题，显著提升了重建质量，可作为现有方法的有效插件使用。

Abstract: We propose a semantic-aware neural reconstruction method to generate 3D
high-fidelity models from sparse images. To tackle the challenge of severe
radiance ambiguity caused by mismatched features in sparse input, we enrich
neural implicit representations by adding patch-based semantic logits that are
optimized together with the signed distance field and the radiance field. A
novel regularization based on the geometric primitive masks is introduced to
mitigate shape ambiguity. The performance of our approach has been verified in
experimental evaluation. The average chamfer distances of our reconstruction on
the DTU dataset can be reduced by 44% for SparseNeuS and 20% for VolRecon. When
working as a plugin for those dense reconstruction baselines such as NeuS and
Neuralangelo, the average error on the DTU dataset can be reduced by 69% and
68% respectively.

Conclusion: 轻量级模型结合集成方法是解决非法垃圾填埋场检测的有效策略，在AerialWaste数据集上表现出色，为实际应用提供了可行方案

Abstract: Illegal landfills are posing as a hazardous threat to people all over the
world. Due to the arduous nature of manually identifying the location of
landfill, many landfills go unnoticed by authorities and later cause dangerous
harm to people and environment. Deep learning can play a significant role in
identifying these landfills while saving valuable time, manpower and resources.
Despite being a burning concern, good quality publicly released datasets for
illegal landfill detection are hard to find due to security concerns. However,
AerialWaste Dataset is a large collection of 10434 images of Lombardy region of
Italy. The images are of varying qualities, collected from three different
sources: AGEA Orthophotos, WorldView-3, and Google Earth. The dataset contains
professionally curated, diverse and high-quality images which makes it
particularly suitable for scalable and impactful research. As we trained
several models to compare results, we found complex and heavy models to be
prone to overfitting and memorizing training data instead of learning patterns.
Therefore, we chose lightweight simpler models which could leverage general
features from the dataset. In this study, Mobilenetv2, Googlenet, Densenet,
MobileVit and other lightweight deep learning models were used to train and
validate the dataset as they achieved significant success with less
overfitting. As we saw substantial improvement in the performance using some of
these models, we combined the best performing models and came up with an
ensemble model. With the help of ensemble and fusion technique, binary
classification could be performed on this dataset with 92.33% accuracy, 92.67%
precision, 92.33% sensitivity, 92.41% F1 score and 92.71% specificity.

Result: 在CMU-MOSI和CMU-MOSEI数据集上达到最先进性能，显著降低计算开销，定性分析验证了可解释性和细粒度情感模式捕捉能力

Conclusion: SSU通过系统整合结构信息和语义对齐，有效提升了多模态情感分析的性能、效率和可解释性

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to infer emotional states by
effectively integrating textual, acoustic, and visual modalities. Despite
notable progress, existing multimodal fusion methods often neglect
modality-specific structural dependencies and semantic misalignment, limiting
their quality, interpretability, and robustness. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel framework called the Structural-Semantic Unifier (SSU),
which systematically integrates modality-specific structural information and
cross-modal semantic grounding for enhanced multimodal representations.
Specifically, SSU dynamically constructs modality-specific graphs by leveraging
linguistic syntax for text and a lightweight, text-guided attention mechanism
for acoustic and visual modalities, thus capturing detailed intra-modal
relationships and semantic interactions. We further introduce a semantic
anchor, derived from global textual semantics, that serves as a cross-modal
alignment hub, effectively harmonizing heterogeneous semantic spaces across
modalities. Additionally, we develop a multiview contrastive learning objective
that promotes discriminability, semantic consistency, and structural coherence
across intra- and inter-modal views. Extensive evaluations on two widely used
benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, demonstrate that SSU consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing
computational overhead compared to prior methods. Comprehensive qualitative
analyses further validate SSU's interpretability and its ability to capture
nuanced emotional patterns through semantically grounded interactions.

*Hao Liang,Zhixuan Ge,Ashish Tiwari,Soumendu Majee,G. M. Dilshan Godaliyadda,Ashok Veeraraghavan,Guha Balakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastAvatar是一个快速前馈框架，能够从任意姿态的单张人脸图像在10毫秒内生成3D高斯溅射模型，具有姿态不变性和身份保持能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D高斯溅射方法要么需要每张脸单独优化（速度慢），要么前馈方法重建质量不足。需要一种既能快速生成又能保持高质量重建的解决方案。

Method: 使用编码器-解码器神经网络设计，首先构建3DGS人脸模板模型，然后将输入图像编码为身份特定、姿态不变的潜在嵌入，解码后预测模板高斯模型的结构和外观参数残差。

Result: 在重建质量上显著优于现有前馈方法（如GAGAvatar），比每脸优化方法快1000倍（如FlashAvatar），支持实时身份插值和属性编辑。

Conclusion: FastAvatar结合了优秀的重建质量和速度，扩展了3D高斯溅射在消费级和交互式系统中照片级真实感头像应用的范围。

Abstract: We present FastAvatar, a pose-invariant, feed-forward framework that can
generate a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from a single face image from an
arbitrary pose in near-instant time (<10ms). FastAvatar uses a novel
encoder-decoder neural network design to achieve both fast fitting and identity
preservation regardless of input pose. First, FastAvatar constructs a 3DGS face
``template'' model from a training dataset of faces with multi-view captures.
Second, FastAvatar encodes the input face image into an identity-specific and
pose-invariant latent embedding, and decodes this embedding to predict
residuals to the structural and appearance parameters of each Gaussian in the
template 3DGS model. By only inferring residuals in a feed-forward fashion,
model inference is fast and robust. FastAvatar significantly outperforms
existing feed-forward face 3DGS methods (e.g., GAGAvatar) in reconstruction
quality, and runs 1000x faster than per-face optimization methods (e.g.,
FlashAvatar, GaussianAvatars and GASP). In addition, FastAvatar's novel latent
space design supports real-time identity interpolation and attribute editing
which is not possible with any existing feed-forward 3DGS face generation
framework. FastAvatar's combination of excellent reconstruction quality and
speed expands the scope of 3DGS for photorealistic avatar applications in
consumer and interactive systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在紧急人道主义场景中使用生物识别技术可以提高效率，但会加剧数据主体的隐私风险，需要开发适合这些脆弱环境的保护方案。

Method: 通过制定功能、操作和安全隐私需求，比较分析生物特征模板保护方案，选择PolyProtect方法应用于神经网络人脸嵌入，并使用EdgeFace特征提取器进行评估。

Result: 实验结果表明PolyProtect在验证和识别准确性、不可逆性和不可链接性方面表现良好，并且证明具有模态无关性，可扩展到指纹识别。

Conclusion: PolyProtect是一种有效、模块化且计算轻量的生物特征模板保护方法，适合人道主义紧急场景，是首次在识别场景和指纹生物识别中进行评估。

Abstract: In humanitarian and emergency scenarios, the use of biometrics can
dramatically improve the efficiency of operations, but it poses risks for the
data subjects, which are exacerbated in contexts of vulnerability. To address
this, we present a mobile biometric system implementing a biometric template
protection (BTP) scheme suitable for these scenarios. After rigorously
formulating the functional, operational, and security and privacy requirements
of these contexts, we perform a broad comparative analysis of the BTP
landscape. PolyProtect, a method designed to operate on neural network face
embeddings, is identified as the most suitable method due to its effectiveness,
modularity, and lightweight computational burden. We evaluate PolyProtect in
terms of verification and identification accuracy, irreversibility, and
unlinkability, when this BTP method is applied to face embeddings extracted
using EdgeFace, a novel state-of-the-art efficient feature extractor, on a
real-world face dataset from a humanitarian field project in Ethiopia.
Moreover, as PolyProtect promises to be modality-independent, we extend its
evaluation to fingerprints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
time that PolyProtect has been evaluated for the identification scenario and
for fingerprint biometrics. Our experimental results are promising, and we plan
to release our code

TL;DR: 视觉基础模型在实体关系识别上存在限制，提出通过动态关系图增强的混合模型能提升表现、可解释性和计算效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉基础模型虽然在表征学习方面表现优异，但在需要明确识别实体、角色和空间时间关系的任务上存在限制，而这些关系能力对于精细人类活动识别、自我视角视频理解等领域至关重要

Method: 提出在基础模型中集成明确的关系接口，具体实例化为动态关系图（图的拓扑结构和边语义根据输入和任务上下文推断），通过轻量级、上下文适配的图推理模块增强基础模型

Result: 在人类操作动作识别和脑罐切割等领域的跨领域证据显示，增强图推理模块的混合模型相比单纯基础模型基线在精细语义保真度、外部分布稳健性、可解释性和计算效率方面都有提升，同时通过语义节点稀疏推理还实现了更优的内存和硬件效率

Conclusion: 提出了一个针对基础模型图混合模型的研究议程，优先考虑学习动态图构建、多级关系推理、跨模态融合以及直接探测结构化视觉任务中关系能力的评估协议

Abstract: Vision foundation models (FMs) have become the predominant architecture in
computer vision, providing highly transferable representations learned from
large-scale, multimodal corpora. Nonetheless, they exhibit persistent
limitations on tasks that require explicit reasoning over entities, roles, and
spatio-temporal relations. Such relational competence is indispensable for
fine-grained human activity recognition, egocentric video understanding, and
multimodal medical image analysis, where spatial, temporal, and semantic
dependencies are decisive for performance. We advance the position that
next-generation FMs should incorporate explicit relational interfaces,
instantiated as dynamic relational graphs (graphs whose topology and edge
semantics are inferred from the input and task context). We illustrate this
position with cross-domain evidence from recent systems in human manipulation
action recognition and brain tumor segmentation, showing that augmenting FMs
with lightweight, context-adaptive graph-reasoning modules improves
fine-grained semantic fidelity, out of distribution robustness,
interpretability, and computational efficiency relative to FM only baselines.
Importantly, by reasoning sparsely over semantic nodes, such hybrids also
achieve favorable memory and hardware efficiency, enabling deployment under
practical resource constraints. We conclude with a targeted research agenda for
FM graph hybrids, prioritizing learned dynamic graph construction, multi-level
relational reasoning (e.g., part object scene in activity understanding, or
region organ in medical imaging), cross-modal fusion, and evaluation protocols
that directly probe relational competence in structured vision tasks.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个新的车牌识别数据集LPLC，用于识别车牌的可读性类别，并评估了多个基线模型的性能，结果显示该任务具有较高挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动车牌识别系统在处理可读性差的车牌时遇到的困难，需要一个专门的数据集来支持选择性地应用图像前处理技术。

Method: 构建包含10,210张车辆图片和12,687个标注车牌的LPLC数据集，采用细粒度标注策略，包括遮挡情况、四个可读性类别和字符标签。使用ViT、ResNet和YOLO三种模型进行基准测试。

Result: 三个基线模型的总体F1分数均低于80%，其中ViT为77.7%，ResNet为78.7%，YOLO为79.9%，显示该分类任务具有较高难度。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了车牌可读性分类任务的挑战性，LPLC数据集为进一步研究提供了价值，并建议在实际应用中选择性地使用图像增强技术。

Abstract: Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) faces a major challenge when
dealing with illegible license plates (LPs). While reconstruction methods such
as super-resolution (SR) have emerged, the core issue of recognizing these
low-quality LPs remains unresolved. To optimize model performance and
computational efficiency, image pre-processing should be applied selectively to
cases that require enhanced legibility. To support research in this area, we
introduce a novel dataset comprising 10,210 images of vehicles with 12,687
annotated LPs for legibility classification (the LPLC dataset). The images span
a wide range of vehicle types, lighting conditions, and camera/image quality
levels. We adopt a fine-grained annotation strategy that includes vehicle- and
LP-level occlusions, four legibility categories (perfect, good, poor, and
illegible), and character labels for three categories (excluding illegible
LPs). As a benchmark, we propose a classification task using three image
recognition networks to determine whether an LP image is good enough, requires
super-resolution, or is completely unrecoverable. The overall F1 score, which
remained below 80% for all three baseline models (ViT, ResNet, and YOLO),
together with the analyses of SR and LP recognition methods, highlights the
difficulty of the task and reinforces the need for further research. The
proposed dataset is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在医疗任务中诊断准确性有限、推理成本高的问题，特别是皮肤病诊断场景下的实际部署挑战

Method: 采用专家-通用框架：1) 轻量级领域训练图像分类器(专家)提供快速准确诊断；2) 压缩的对话VLM(通用)生成自然语言解释；3) 知识图谱检索模块确保回答的事实准确性

Result: 在皮肤病多模态数据集上，诊断准确率比最强基线提升18%，平均VRAM需求降低20%，延迟减少5%

Conclusion: 专家-通用系统为构建轻量级、可信赖且临床可行的AI系统提供了实用而强大的范式

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant potential for medical
tasks; however, their general-purpose nature can limit specialized diagnostic
accuracy, and their large size poses substantial inference costs for real-world
clinical deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce CLARIFY, a
Specialist-Generalist framework for dermatological visual question answering
(VQA). CLARIFY combines two components: (i) a lightweight, domain-trained image
classifier (the Specialist) that provides fast and highly accurate diagnostic
predictions, and (ii) a powerful yet compressed conversational VLM (the
Generalist) that generates natural language explanations to user queries. In
our framework, the Specialist's predictions directly guide the Generalist's
reasoning, focusing it on the correct diagnostic path. This synergy is further
enhanced by a knowledge graph-based retrieval module, which grounds the
Generalist's responses in factual dermatological knowledge, ensuring both
accuracy and reliability. This hierarchical design not only reduces diagnostic
errors but also significantly improves computational efficiency. Experiments on
our curated multimodal dermatology dataset demonstrate that CLARIFY achieves an
18\% improvement in diagnostic accuracy over the strongest baseline, a
fine-tuned, uncompressed single-line VLM, while reducing the average VRAM
requirement and latency by at least 20\% and 5\%, respectively. These results
indicate that a Specialist-Generalist system provides a practical and powerful
paradigm for building lightweight, trustworthy, and clinically viable AI
systems.

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in surveillance footage is inherently challenging due to
their unpredictable and context-dependent nature. This work introduces a novel
context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection framework that identifies abnormal
events without exposure to anomaly examples during training. The proposed
hybrid architecture combines TimeSformer, DPC, and CLIP to model spatiotemporal
dynamics and semantic context. TimeSformer serves as the vision backbone to
extract rich spatial-temporal features, while DPC forecasts future
representations to identify temporal deviations. Furthermore, a CLIP-based
semantic stream enables concept-level anomaly detection through
context-specific text prompts. These components are jointly trained using
InfoNCE and CPC losses, aligning visual inputs with their temporal and semantic
representations. A context-gating mechanism further enhances decision-making by
modulating predictions with scene-aware cues or global video features. By
integrating predictive modeling with vision-language understanding, the system
can generalize to previously unseen behaviors in complex environments. This
framework bridges the gap between temporal reasoning and semantic context in
zero-shot anomaly detection for surveillance. The code for this research has
been made available at

Motivation: 当前自监督方法在长距离和恶劣天气场景中性能不如全监督方法，而全监督方法依赖昂贵的人工标注难以扩展。需要开发无需人工标注的高性能自监督解决方案。

Method: 提出跨模态标签迁移方法：从4D雷达多普勒测量实时计算运动伪标签，通过动态感知关联和歧义消除传播将标签转移到LiDAR域。

Result: 在MAN TruckScenes数据集上大幅超越现有自监督方法，仅需10%真实标签数据即可达到全监督方法90%以上的性能。

Conclusion: DoGFlow证明了通过跨模态标签迁移可以实现高效的自监督3D场景流估计，为自动驾驶系统在动态环境中的安全导航提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene flow estimation is critical for autonomous systems to
navigate dynamic environments safely, but creating the necessary large-scale,
manually annotated datasets remains a significant bottleneck for developing
robust perception models. Current self-supervised methods struggle to match the
performance of fully supervised approaches, especially in challenging
long-range and adverse weather scenarios, while supervised methods are not
scalable due to their reliance on expensive human labeling. We introduce
DoGFlow, a novel self-supervised framework that recovers full 3D object motions
for LiDAR scene flow estimation without requiring any manual ground truth
annotations. This paper presents our cross-modal label transfer approach, where
DoGFlow computes motion pseudo-labels in real-time directly from 4D radar
Doppler measurements and transfers them to the LiDAR domain using dynamic-aware
association and ambiguity-resolved propagation. On the challenging MAN
TruckScenes dataset, DoGFlow substantially outperforms existing self-supervised
methods and improves label efficiency by enabling LiDAR backbones to achieve
over 90% of fully supervised performance with only 10% of the ground truth
data. For more details, please visit https://ajinkyakhoche.github.io/DogFlow/

Motivation: 现有基于图像的3D生成方法难以从卫星图像的俯视图中准确恢复建筑结构，而3D细节化方法又过度依赖详细体素输入，无法从简单先验（如长方体）生成满意结果。

Method: 通过建模从插值噪声粗先验到详细几何的转换过程，实现灵活的几何控制而不增加计算成本，并开发了包含5万多个独特风格化3D建筑资产的大规模数据集Skylines-50K。

Result: 广泛评估表明该方法有效且具有强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SatSkylines方法成功解决了卫星图像3D建筑生成的几何准确性和细节化问题，为建筑模型生成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We present SatSkylines, a 3D building generation approach that takes
satellite imagery and coarse geometric priors. Without proper geometric
guidance, existing image-based 3D generation methods struggle to recover
accurate building structures from the top-down views of satellite images alone.
On the other hand, 3D detailization methods tend to rely heavily on highly
detailed voxel inputs and fail to produce satisfying results from simple priors
such as cuboids. To address these issues, our key idea is to model the
transformation from interpolated noisy coarse priors to detailed geometries,
enabling flexible geometric control without additional computational cost. We
have further developed Skylines-50K, a large-scale dataset of over 50,000
unique and stylized 3D building assets in order to support the generations of
detailed building models. Extensive evaluations indicate the effectiveness of
our model and strong generalization ability.

Motivation: 玩家依赖视觉可供性来发现地图过渡点，高效识别这些点对客户端自动地图生成和地图提示评估很重要。

Method: 使用两阶段深度学习管道：首先用Faster R-CNN检测潜在STP，然后用轻量级MSTP选择器融合局部和全局视觉特征进行排序，采用参数高效适配器。

Result: 实验显示完整网络微调在充足数据下STP检测效果更好，但适配器迁移在低数据场景和MSTP选择任务中更稳健有效。

Abstract: In complex 3D game environments, players rely on visual affordances to spot
map transition points. Efficient identification of such points is important to
client-side auto-mapping, and provides an objective basis for evaluating map
cue presentation. In this work, we formalize the task of detecting traversable
Spatial Transition Points (STPs)-connectors between two sub regions-and
selecting the singular Main STP (MSTP), the unique STP that lies on the
designer-intended critical path toward the player's current macro-objective,
from a single game frame, proposing this as a new research focus. We introduce
a two-stage deep-learning pipeline that first detects potential STPs using
Faster R-CNN and then ranks them with a lightweight MSTP selector that fuses
local and global visual features. Both stages benefit from parameter-efficient
adapters, and we further introduce an optional retrieval-augmented fusion step.
Our primary goal is to establish the feasibility of this problem and set
baseline performance metrics. We validate our approach on a custom-built,
diverse dataset collected from five Action RPG titles. Our experiments reveal a
key trade-off: while full-network fine-tuning produces superior STP detection
with sufficient data, adapter-only transfer is significantly more robust and
effective in low-data scenarios and for the MSTP selection task. By defining
this novel problem, providing a baseline pipeline and dataset, and offering
initial insights into efficient model adaptation, we aim to contribute to
future AI-driven navigation aids and data-informed level-design tools.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for audio-driven character animation
demonstrate promising performance for scenarios primarily involving speech and
singing. However, they often fall short in more complex film and television
productions, which demand sophisticated elements such as nuanced character
interactions, realistic body movements, and dynamic camera work. To address
this long-standing challenge of achieving film-level character animation, we
propose an audio-driven model, which we refere to as Wan-S2V, built upon Wan.
Our model achieves significantly enhanced expressiveness and fidelity in
cinematic contexts compared to existing approaches. We conducted extensive
experiments, benchmarking our method against cutting-edge models such as
Hunyuan-Avatar and Omnihuman. The experimental results consistently demonstrate
that our approach significantly outperforms these existing solutions.
Additionally, we explore the versatility of our method through its applications
in long-form video generation and precise video lip-sync editing.

Method: 提出Decoupling-Reorganization-Fusion框架，包含模态解耦、随机特征重组和动态MoE融合模块，并在解耦模块中引入区域交叉注意力网络提升特征表示质量。

Conclusion: DeReF框架通过创新的特征重组策略有效解决了多模态融合中的信息交互限制问题，提高了癌症生存预测的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Cancer survival analysis commonly integrates information across diverse
medical modalities to make survival-time predictions. Existing methods
primarily focus on extracting different decoupled features of modalities and
performing fusion operations such as concatenation, attention, and MoE-based
(Mixture-of-Experts) fusion. However, these methods still face two key
challenges: i) Fixed fusion schemes (concatenation and attention) can lead to
model over-reliance on predefined feature combinations, limiting the dynamic
fusion of decoupled features; ii) in MoE-based fusion methods, each expert
network handles separate decoupled features, which limits information
interaction among the decoupled features. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel Decoupling-Reorganization-Fusion framework (DeReF), which
devises a random feature reorganization strategy between modalities decoupling
and dynamic MoE fusion modules.Its advantages are: i) it increases the
diversity of feature combinations and granularity, enhancing the generalization
ability of the subsequent expert networks; ii) it overcomes the problem of
information closure and helps expert networks better capture information among
decoupled features. Additionally, we incorporate a regional cross-attention
network within the modality decoupling module to improve the representation
quality of decoupled features. Extensive experimental results on our in-house
Liver Cancer (LC) and three widely used TCGA public datasets confirm the
effectiveness of our proposed method. The code will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: ROSE框架通过系统性处理对象副作用和合成数据训练，显著提升了视频对象移除的质量和效果，为处理复杂视频修复任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Video object removal has achieved advanced performance due to the recent
success of video generative models. However, when addressing the side effects
of objects, e.g., their shadows and reflections, existing works struggle to
eliminate these effects for the scarcity of paired video data as supervision.
This paper presents ROSE, termed Remove Objects with Side Effects, a framework
that systematically studies the object's effects on environment, which can be
categorized into five common cases: shadows, reflections, light, translucency
and mirror. Given the challenges of curating paired videos exhibiting the
aforementioned effects, we leverage a 3D rendering engine for synthetic data
generation. We carefully construct a fully-automatic pipeline for data
preparation, which simulates a large-scale paired dataset with diverse scenes,
objects, shooting angles, and camera trajectories. ROSE is implemented as an
video inpainting model built on diffusion transformer. To localize all
object-correlated areas, the entire video is fed into the model for
reference-based erasing. Moreover, additional supervision is introduced to
explicitly predict the areas affected by side effects, which can be revealed
through the differential mask between the paired videos. To fully investigate
the model performance on various side effect removal, we presents a new
benchmark, dubbed ROSE-Bench, incorporating both common scenarios and the five
special side effects for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results
demonstrate that ROSE achieves superior performance compared to existing video
object erasing models and generalizes well to real-world video scenarios. The

TL;DR: 本文提出OwlCap模型和HMD-270K数据集，通过Motion-Detail Fusion和Fine-Grained Examination构建数据集，并引入Caption Set Equivalence Reward优化方法，解决视频字幕生成中运动与细节不平衡的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频字幕生成方法存在运动-细节不平衡问题，模型往往过度强调一个方面而忽视另一个方面，导致生成的字幕不完整，影响视频理解和生成的一致性。

Method: 1) 数据层面：通过两阶段流程构建HMD-270K数据集（Motion-Detail Fusion和Fine-Grained Examination）；2) 优化层面：基于Group Relative Policy Optimization引入Caption Set Equivalence Reward，通过unit-to-set匹配和双向验证提升完整性和准确性。

Result: OwlCap在细节导向的VDC基准上Acc提升4.2，在运动导向的DREAM-1K基准上F1提升4.6，显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 提出的HMD-270K数据集和OwlCap模型有效解决了视频字幕生成中的运动-细节不平衡问题，将公开发布以促进视频字幕研究社区的发展。

Abstract: Video captioning aims to generate comprehensive and coherent descriptions of
the video content, contributing to the advancement of both video understanding
and generation. However, existing methods often suffer from motion-detail
imbalance, as models tend to overemphasize one aspect while neglecting the
other. This imbalance results in incomplete captions, which in turn leads to a
lack of consistency in video understanding and generation. To address this
issue, we propose solutions from two aspects: 1) Data aspect: We constructed
the Harmonizing Motion-Detail 270K (HMD-270K) dataset through a two-stage
pipeline: Motion-Detail Fusion (MDF) and Fine-Grained Examination (FGE). 2)
Optimization aspect: We introduce the Caption Set Equivalence Reward (CSER)
based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). CSER enhances completeness
and accuracy in capturing both motion and details through unit-to-set matching
and bidirectional validation. Based on the HMD-270K supervised fine-tuning and
GRPO post-training with CSER, we developed OwlCap, a powerful video captioning
multi-modal large language model (MLLM) with motion-detail balance.
Experimental results demonstrate that OwlCap achieves significant improvements
compared to baseline models on two benchmarks: the detail-focused VDC (+4.2
Acc) and the motion-focused DREAM-1K (+4.6 F1). The HMD-270K dataset and OwlCap
model will be publicly released to facilitate video captioning research
community advancements.

Abstract: Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBIs), play a crucial role in understanding ancient
Chinese civilization. The automated detection of OBIs from rubbing images
represents a fundamental yet challenging task in digital archaeology, primarily
due to various degradation factors including noise and cracks that limit the
effectiveness of conventional detection networks. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel clustering-based feature space representation learning
method. Our approach uniquely leverages the Oracle Bones Character (OBC) font
library dataset as prior knowledge to enhance feature extraction in the
detection network through clustering-based representation learning. The method
incorporates a specialized loss function derived from clustering results to
optimize feature representation, which is then integrated into the total
network loss. We validate the effectiveness of our method by conducting
experiments on two OBIs detection dataset using three mainstream detection
frameworks: Faster R-CNN, DETR, and Sparse R-CNN. Through extensive
experimentation, all frameworks demonstrate significant performance
improvements.

TL;DR: 提出了SFormer模型，通过频域SNR先验和傅里叶注意力机制，结合频率自适应变换器，显著提升水下图像增强效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于SNR先验的水下图像增强方法在空间域存在两个局限：无法有效分离跨通道干扰，以及在放大信息结构同时抑制噪声方面效果有限

Method: 提出频域SNR先验，将特征分解为振幅和相位谱；设计傅里叶注意力SNR先验变换器(FAST)和频率自适应变换器(FAT)；采用U型架构整合传统RGB流和SNR引导分支

Result: 在UIEB、EUVP和LSUI数据集的4800对图像上训练，PSNR提升3.1 dB，SSIM提升0.08，成功恢复水下场景的颜色、纹理和对比度

Conclusion: 频域SNR先验比空间域方法更有效，SFormer模型在定量和定性评估上均优于现有方法

Abstract: Recent learning-based underwater image enhancement (UIE) methods have
advanced by incorporating physical priors into deep neural networks,
particularly using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) prior to reduce
wavelength-dependent attenuation. However, spatial domain SNR priors have two
limitations: (i) they cannot effectively separate cross-channel interference,
and (ii) they provide limited help in amplifying informative structures while
suppressing noise. To overcome these, we propose using the SNR prior in the
frequency domain, decomposing features into amplitude and phase spectra for
better channel modulation. We introduce the Fourier Attention SNR-prior
Transformer (FAST), combining spectral interactions with SNR cues to highlight
key spectral components. Additionally, the Frequency Adaptive Transformer (FAT)
bottleneck merges low- and high-frequency branches using a gated attention
mechanism to enhance perceptual quality. Embedded in a unified U-shaped
architecture, these modules integrate a conventional RGB stream with an
SNR-guided branch, forming SFormer. Trained on 4,800 paired images from UIEB,
EUVP, and LSUI, SFormer surpasses recent methods with a 3.1 dB gain in PSNR and
0.08 in SSIM, successfully restoring colors, textures, and contrast in
underwater scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究虽然分割性能良好，但在EF估计方面表现不佳，需要同时处理单帧细节和多帧时空关系来改善EF计算准确性

Method: 分层网络设计：低层使用卷积网络处理单帧图像保留细节，高层采用Mamba架构捕获时空关系；提出Spatio-temporal Cross Scan (STCS)模块通过跨帧跨位置扫描整合长程上下文

Result: 该方法能够平衡单帧和多帧处理，避免单帧处理的局部误差累积和多帧处理的细节丢失问题，减轻超声图像噪声等因素对EF计算的偏差影响

Conclusion: 提出的分层时空分割网络通过协同局部细节建模和全局动态感知，有效提升了超声心动图视频中左心室内膜分割和EF估计的准确性

Abstract: Automated segmentation of the left ventricular endocardium in
echocardiography videos is a key research area in cardiology. It aims to
provide accurate assessment of cardiac structure and function through Ejection
Fraction (EF) estimation. Although existing studies have achieved good
segmentation performance, their results do not perform well in EF estimation.
In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network
(\ourmodel) for echocardiography video, aiming to improve EF estimation
accuracy by synergizing local detail modeling with global dynamic perception.
The network employs a hierarchical design, with low-level stages using
convolutional networks to process single-frame images and preserve details,
while high-level stages utilize the Mamba architecture to capture
spatio-temporal relationships. The hierarchical design balances single-frame
and multi-frame processing, avoiding issues such as local error accumulation
when relying solely on single frames or neglecting details when using only
multi-frame data. To overcome local spatio-temporal limitations, we propose the
Spatio-temporal Cross Scan (STCS) module, which integrates long-range context
through skip scanning across frames and positions. This approach helps mitigate
EF calculation biases caused by ultrasound image noise and other factors.

TL;DR: FPS是一种新颖的无监督域适应框架，通过冻结预训练特征编码器、优化决策边界来应对域偏移问题，在保持高效性和可解释性的同时实现竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有域适应方法主要依赖微调特征提取器，存在效率低、可解释性差和可扩展性差的问题。研究发现预训练模型的特征空间具有域不变的几何模式，域偏移主要表现为边界错位而非特征退化。

Method: 提出特征空间平面搜索器(FPS)，保持特征编码器冻结，仅优化决策边界来利用预训练模型中的几何模式。通过离线特征提取实现全数据集单次计算优化，大幅降低内存和计算成本。

Result: 在公共基准测试中达到或超越最先进方法的性能，能够高效扩展到多模态大模型，在蛋白质结构预测、遥感分类和地震检测等多个领域展现出色适应性。

Conclusion: FPS为迁移学习提供了一个简单、有效且通用的范式，特别适用于域适应任务，具有优秀的可解释性和计算效率。

Abstract: Domain shift, characterized by degraded model performance during transition
from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains, poses a persistent
challenge for deploying deep learning systems. Current unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) methods predominantly rely on fine-tuning feature extractors -
an approach limited by inefficiency, reduced interpretability, and poor
scalability to modern architectures.
  Our analysis reveals that models pretrained on large-scale data exhibit
domain-invariant geometric patterns in their feature space, characterized by
intra-class clustering and inter-class separation, thereby preserving
transferable discriminative structures. These findings indicate that domain
shifts primarily manifest as boundary misalignment rather than feature
degradation.
  Unlike fine-tuning entire pre-trained models - which risks introducing
unpredictable feature distortions - we propose the Feature-space Planes
Searcher (FPS): a novel domain adaptation framework that optimizes decision
boundaries by leveraging these geometric patterns while keeping the feature
encoder frozen. This streamlined approach enables interpretative analysis of
adaptation while substantially reducing memory and computational costs through
offline feature extraction, permitting full-dataset optimization in a single
computation cycle.
  Evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that FPS achieves competitive or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods. FPS scales efficiently with
multimodal large models and shows versatility across diverse domains including
protein structure prediction, remote sensing classification, and earthquake
detection. We anticipate FPS will provide a simple, effective, and
generalizable paradigm for transfer learning, particularly in domain adaptation
tasks. .

Conclusion: 该框架提供了轻量级、可扩展的人体活动识别解决方案，适用于智能监控、辅助技术和自主监控系统等实际应用场景。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a pivotal role in various
applications, including smart surveillance, healthcare, assistive technologies,
sports analytics, etc. However, HAR systems still face critical challenges,
including high computational costs, redundant features, and limited scalability
in real-time scenarios. An optimized hybrid deep learning framework is
introduced that integrates a customized InceptionV3, an LSTM architecture, and
a novel ensemble-based feature selection strategy. The proposed framework first
extracts spatial descriptors using the customized InceptionV3 model, which
captures multilevel contextual patterns, region homogeneity, and fine-grained
localization cues. The temporal dependencies across frames are then modeled
using LSTMs to effectively encode motion dynamics. Finally, an ensemble-based
genetic algorithm with Adaptive Dynamic Fitness Sharing and Attention (ADFSA)
is employed to select a compact and optimized feature set by dynamically
balancing objectives such as accuracy, redundancy, uniqueness, and complexity
reduction. Consequently, the selected feature subsets, which are both diverse
and discriminative, enable various lightweight machine learning classifiers to
achieve accurate and robust HAR in heterogeneous environments. Experimental
results on the robust UCF-YouTube dataset, which presents challenges such as
occlusion, cluttered backgrounds, motion dynamics, and poor illumination,
demonstrate good performance. The proposed approach achieves 99.65% recognition
accuracy, reduces features to as few as 7, and enhances inference time. The
lightweight and scalable nature of the HAR system supports real-time deployment
on edge devices such as Raspberry Pi, enabling practical applications in
intelligent, resource-aware environments, including public safety, assistive
technology, and autonomous monitoring systems.

Motivation: 现有内镜视频重建方法在摘捧细微颜色变化和模拟全局变形方面存在限制，3D高斯拖尾法的固定颜色分配和线性变形模型无法满足多变细致纹理和一致性全局变形的需求。

Method: 提出ColorGS框架：1）带颜色高斯基元，使用动态锚点和可学习颜色参数来适配性编码空间变化纹理；2）增强变形模型，结合时间敏感高斯基函数和可学习时间独立变形，精确摘捧局部组织变形和全局运动一致性。

Conclusion: ColorGS通过给合高保真性和计算实用性，推进了手术场景重建技术发展，对于术中导航和AR/VR应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: High-fidelity reconstruction of deformable tissues from endoscopic videos
remains challenging due to the limitations of existing methods in capturing
subtle color variations and modeling global deformations. While 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) enables efficient dynamic reconstruction, its fixed
per-Gaussian color assignment struggles with intricate textures, and linear
deformation modeling fails to model consistent global deformation. To address
these issues, we propose ColorGS, a novel framework that integrates spatially
adaptive color encoding and enhanced deformation modeling for surgical scene
reconstruction. First, we introduce Colored Gaussian Primitives, which employ
dynamic anchors with learnable color parameters to adaptively encode spatially
varying textures, significantly improving color expressiveness under complex
lighting and tissue similarity. Second, we design an Enhanced Deformation Model
(EDM) that combines time-aware Gaussian basis functions with learnable
time-independent deformations, enabling precise capture of both localized
tissue deformations and global motion consistency caused by surgical
interactions. Extensive experiments on DaVinci robotic surgery videos and
benchmark datasets (EndoNeRF, StereoMIS) demonstrate that ColorGS achieves
state-of-the-art performance, attaining a PSNR of 39.85 (1.5 higher than prior
3DGS-based methods) and superior SSIM (97.25\%) while maintaining real-time
rendering efficiency. Our work advances surgical scene reconstruction by
balancing high fidelity with computational practicality, critical for
intraoperative guidance and AR/VR applications.

Conclusion: 类别测洗正则化是一种有效的方法，能够在不平衡数据集上同时改善少数类识别和整体泛化性能

Abstract: The purpose of training neural networks is to achieve high generalization
performance on unseen inputs. However, when trained on imbalanced datasets, a
model's prediction tends to favor majority classes over minority classes,
leading to significant degradation in the recognition performance of minority
classes. To address this issue, we propose class-wise flooding regularization,
an extension of flooding regularization applied at the class level. Flooding is
a regularization technique that mitigates overfitting by preventing the
training loss from falling below a predefined threshold, known as the flooding
level, thereby discouraging memorization. Our proposed method assigns a
class-specific flooding level based on class frequencies. By doing so, it
suppresses overfitting in majority classes while allowing sufficient learning
for minority classes. We validate our approach on imbalanced image
classification. Compared to conventional flooding regularizations, our method
improves the classification performance of minority classes and achieves better
overall generalization.

Motivation: 传统课程学习依赖损失值或梯度评估样本难度，但在平坦最小值区域这些指标变得不敏感，难以有效设计课程。需要一种在平坦区域仍能准确评估样本难度的方法

Method: 提出对抗难度度量(ADM)，通过计算原始样本与对抗样本的归一化损失差距来量化样本的对抗脆弱性。将ADM集成到基于SAM的课程学习框架中，动态评估样本难度

Result: 在图像分类、细粒度识别和域泛化任务上验证，方法同时保留了课程学习和SAM的优势，优于现有课程学习和平坦感知训练策略

Conclusion: ADM提供了一种在平坦最小值区域有效评估样本难度的方法，成功结合了课程学习和SAM训练，显著提升了模型的泛化能力

Abstract: Neural networks trained by empirical risk minimization often suffer from
overfitting, especially to specific samples or domains, which leads to poor
generalization. Curriculum Learning (CL) addresses this issue by selecting
training samples based on the difficulty. From the optimization perspective,
methods such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improve robustness and
generalization by seeking flat minima. However, combining CL with SAM is not
straightforward. In flat regions, both the loss values and the gradient norms
tend to become uniformly small, which makes it difficult to evaluate sample
difficulty and design an effective curriculum. To overcome this problem, we
propose the Adversarial Difficulty Measure (ADM), which quantifies adversarial
vulnerability by leveraging the robustness properties of models trained toward
flat minima. Unlike loss- or gradient-based measures, which become ineffective
as training progresses into flatter regions, ADM remains informative by
measuring the normalized loss gap between original and adversarial examples. We
incorporate ADM into CL-based training with SAM to dynamically assess sample
difficulty. We evaluated our approach on image classification tasks,
fine-grained recognition, and domain generalization. The results demonstrate
that our method preserves the strengths of both CL and SAM while outperforming
existing curriculum-based and flatness-aware training strategies.

Motivation: 水下目标检测对海洋生态监测至关重要，但存在图像质量退化、类别分布不平衡和独特视觉特征等挑战。不同物种检测性能差异显著，但根本原因尚不清楚。

Method: 使用DUO数据集，将目标检测任务分解为定位和分类两个阶段，利用YOLO11和TIDE工具分析扇贝类的检测性能问题，进行定位分析和分类实验。

Conclusion: 建议优先精度时使用不平衡分布，优先召回率时使用平衡分布；改进低性能类别应重点关注算法进步，特别是在定位模块方面；代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: Underwater object detection is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems but
poses unique challenges, including degraded image quality, imbalanced class
distribution, and distinct visual characteristics. Not every species is
detected equally well, yet underlying causes remain unclear. We address two key
research questions: 1) What factors beyond data quantity drive class-specific
performance disparities? 2) How can we systematically improve detection of
under-performing marine species? We manipulate the DUO dataset to separate the
object detection task into localization and classification and investigate the
under-performance of the scallop class. Localization analysis using YOLO11 and
TIDE finds that foreground-background discrimination is the most problematic
stage regardless of data quantity. Classification experiments reveal persistent
precision gaps even with balanced data, indicating intrinsic feature-based
challenges beyond data scarcity and inter-class dependencies. We recommend
imbalanced distributions when prioritizing precision, and balanced
distributions when prioritizing recall. Improving under-performing classes
should focus on algorithmic advances, especially within localization modules.
We publicly release our code and datasets.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) generative modeling is driving significant
innovations across industrial applications. Recent works have shown remarkable
progress in creating solid models from various inputs such as point clouds,
meshes, and text descriptions. However, these methods fundamentally diverge
from traditional industrial workflows that begin with 2D engineering drawings.
The automatic generation of parametric CAD models from these 2D vector drawings
remains underexplored despite being a critical step in engineering design. To
address this gap, our key insight is to reframe CAD generation as a
sequence-to-sequence learning problem where vector drawing primitives directly
inform the generation of parametric CAD operations, preserving geometric
precision and design intent throughout the transformation process. We propose
Drawing2CAD, a framework with three key technical components: a
network-friendly vector primitive representation that preserves precise
geometric information, a dual-decoder transformer architecture that decouples
command type and parameter generation while maintaining precise correspondence,
and a soft target distribution loss function accommodating inherent flexibility
in CAD parameters. To train and evaluate Drawing2CAD, we create CAD-VGDrawing,
a dataset of paired engineering drawings and parametric CAD models, and conduct
thorough experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/lllssc/Drawing2CAD.

Conclusion: 路由器门控跨模态特征融合框架能够有效应对音频质量变化，在噪声环境下通过动态模态权重调整显著提升音频-视觉语音识别性能

Abstract: Robust audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) in noisy environments remains
challenging, as existing systems struggle to estimate audio reliability and
dynamically adjust modality reliance. We propose router-gated cross-modal
feature fusion, a novel AVSR framework that adaptively reweights audio and
visual features based on token-level acoustic corruption scores. Using an
audio-visual feature fusion-based router, our method down-weights unreliable
audio tokens and reinforces visual cues through gated cross-attention in each
decoder layer. This enables the model to pivot toward the visual modality when
audio quality deteriorates. Experiments on LRS3 demonstrate that our approach
achieves an 16.51-42.67% relative reduction in word error rate compared to
AV-HuBERT. Ablation studies confirm that both the router and gating mechanism
contribute to improved robustness under real-world acoustic noise.

Conclusion: 新标准为HOI检测提供了更合理的评估框架，支持多重合理解和公平比较，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Prior human-object interaction (HOI) detection methods have integrated early
vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP, but only as supporting components
within their frameworks. In contrast, recent advances in large, generative VLMs
suggest that these models may already possess strong ability to understand
images involving HOI. This naturally raises an important question: can
general-purpose standalone VLMs effectively solve HOI detection, and how do
they compare with specialized HOI methods? Answering this requires a benchmark
that can accommodate both paradigms. However, existing HOI benchmarks such as
HICO-DET were developed before the emergence of modern VLMs, and their
evaluation protocols require exact matches to annotated HOI classes. This is
poorly aligned with the generative nature of VLMs, which often yield multiple
valid interpretations in ambiguous cases. For example, a static image may
capture a person mid-motion with a frisbee, which can plausibly be interpreted
as either "throwing" or "catching". When only "catching" is annotated, the
other, though equally plausible for the image, is marked incorrect when exact
matching is used. As a result, correct predictions might be penalized,
affecting both VLMs and HOI-specific methods. To avoid penalizing valid
predictions, we introduce a new benchmark that reformulates HOI detection as a
multiple-answer multiple-choice task, where each question includes only
ground-truth positive options and a curated set of negatives that are
constructed to reduce ambiguity (e.g., when "catching" is annotated, "throwing"
is not selected as a negative to avoid penalizing valid predictions). The
proposed evaluation protocol is the first of its kind for both VLMs and HOI
methods, enabling direct comparison and offering new insight into the current
state of progress in HOI understanding.

Conclusion: CmOS框架有效解决了教育选择题中视觉选项生成的挑战，为自动化生成高质量多选题提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) play a crucial role in fostering deep
thinking and knowledge integration in education. However, previous research has
primarily focused on generating MCQs with textual options, but it largely
overlooks the visual options. Moreover, generating high-quality distractors
remains a major challenge due to the high cost and limited scalability of
manual authoring. To tackle these problems, we propose a Cross-modal Options
Synthesis (CmOS), a novel framework for generating educational MCQs with visual
options. Our framework integrates Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) reasoning
process and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce semantically
plausible and visually similar answer and distractors. It also includes a
discrimination module to identify content suitable for visual options.
Experimental results on test tasks demonstrate the superiority of CmOS in
content discrimination, question generation and visual option generation over
existing methods across various subjects and educational levels.

Abstract: The growing integration of smart environments and low-power computing
devices, coupled with mass-market sensor technologies, is driving advancements
in remote and non-contact physiological monitoring. However, deploying these
systems in real-time on resource-constrained platforms introduces significant
challenges related to scalability, interoperability, and performance. This
paper presents a real-time remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) system optimized
for low-power devices, designed to extract physiological signals, such as heart
rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and oxygen saturation (SpO2), from facial
video streams. The system is built on the Face2PPG pipeline, which processes
video frames sequentially for rPPG signal extraction and analysis, while
leveraging a multithreaded architecture to manage video capture, real-time
processing, network communication, and graphical user interface (GUI) updates
concurrently. This design ensures continuous, reliable operation at 30 frames
per second (fps), with adaptive feedback through a collaborative user interface
to guide optimal signal capture conditions. The network interface includes both
an HTTP server for continuous video streaming and a RESTful API for on-demand
vital sign retrieval. To ensure accurate performance despite the limitations of
low-power devices, we use a hybrid programming model combining Functional
Reactive Programming (FRP) and the Actor Model, allowing event-driven
processing and efficient task parallelization. The system is evaluated under
real-time constraints, demonstrating robustness while minimizing computational
overhead. Our work addresses key challenges in real-time biosignal monitoring,
offering practical solutions for optimizing performance in modern healthcare
and human-computer interaction applications.

Abstract: Online mapping models show remarkable results in predicting vectorized maps
from multi-view camera images only. However, all existing approaches still rely
on ground-truth high-definition maps during training, which are expensive to
obtain and often not geographically diverse enough for reliable generalization.
In this work, we propose PseudoMapTrainer, a novel approach to online mapping
that uses pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled sensor data. We derive those
pseudo-labels by reconstructing the road surface from multi-camera imagery
using Gaussian splatting and semantics of a pre-trained 2D segmentation
network. In addition, we introduce a mask-aware assignment algorithm and loss
function to handle partially masked pseudo-labels, allowing for the first time
the training of online mapping models without any ground-truth maps.
Furthermore, our pseudo-labels can be effectively used to pre-train an online
model in a semi-supervised manner to leverage large-scale unlabeled
crowdsourced data. The code is available at

Abstract: Effective waste sorting is critical for sustainable recycling, yet AI
research in this domain continues to lag behind commercial systems due to
limited datasets and reliance on legacy object detectors. In this work, we
advance AI-driven waste detection by establishing strong baselines and
introducing an ensemble-based semi-supervised learning framework. We first
benchmark state-of-the-art Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) models on
the real-world ZeroWaste dataset, demonstrating that while class-only prompts
perform poorly, LLM-optimized prompts significantly enhance zero-shot accuracy.
Next, to address domain-specific limitations, we fine-tune modern
transformer-based detectors, achieving a new baseline of 51.6 mAP. We then
propose a soft pseudo-labeling strategy that fuses ensemble predictions using
spatial and consensus-aware weighting, enabling robust semi-supervised
training. Applied to the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, our pseudo-annotations
achieve performance gains that surpass fully supervised training, underscoring
the effectiveness of scalable annotation pipelines. Our work contributes to the
research community by establishing rigorous baselines, introducing a robust
ensemble-based pseudo-labeling pipeline, generating high-quality annotations
for the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, and systematically evaluating OVOD models
under real-world waste sorting conditions. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同字体样式传递特定印象，字体形状与印象标签存在紧密关联。传统词嵌入方法如BERT和CLIP在这些印象标签上表现不佳，需要专门的嵌入方法来更好地表征字体印象。

Method: 构建一个图结构，节点代表印象标签，边编码标签间的共现关系。然后应用谱嵌入技术来获取每个标签的印象向量。

Result: 与BERT和CLIP相比，该方法在定性和定量评估中都表现更好，特别是在印象导向的字体生成任务中显示出更优的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种有效的方法来捐换字体形状与印象标签之间的关系，为印象基于的字体生成和检索应用提供了更准确的表征手段。

Abstract: Different font styles (i.e., font shapes) convey distinct impressions,
indicating a close relationship between font shapes and word tags describing
those impressions. This paper proposes a novel embedding method for impression
tags that leverages these shape-impression relationships. For instance, our
method assigns similar vectors to impression tags that frequently co-occur in
order to represent impressions of fonts, whereas standard word embedding
methods (e.g., BERT and CLIP) yield very different vectors. This property is
particularly useful for impression-based font generation and font retrieval.
Technically, we construct a graph whose nodes represent impression tags and
whose edges encode co-occurrence relationships. Then, we apply spectral
embedding to obtain the impression vectors for each tag. We compare our method
with BERT and CLIP in qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating
that our approach performs better in impression-guided font generation.

Result: 在荷兰的国家森林调查分类任务中，深度特征方法比当前最优方法准确率提高了10%，在所有数据集上都显示出显著优势。

Conclusion: 经典的手工设计调和特征对于树种分类任务过于简单，深度AI特征在数据有限的应用中具有巨大潜力，可以有效补充现有森林调查过程。

Abstract: National Forest Inventory (NFI)s serve as the primary source of forest
information, providing crucial tree species distribution data. However,
maintaining these inventories requires labor-intensive on-site campaigns.
Remote sensing approaches, particularly when combined with machine learning,
offer opportunities to update NFIs more frequently and at larger scales. While
the use of Satellite Image Time Series has proven effective for distinguishing
tree species through seasonal canopy reflectance patterns, current approaches
rely primarily on Random Forest classifiers with hand-designed features and
phenology-based metrics. Using deep features from an available pre-trained
remote sensing foundation models offers a complementary strategy. These
pre-trained models leverage unannotated global data and are meant to used for
general-purpose applications and can then be efficiently fine-tuned with
smaller labeled datasets for specific classification tasks. This work
systematically investigates how deep features improve tree species
classification accuracy in the Netherlands with few annotated data. Data-wise,
we extracted time-series data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and ERA5 satellites
data and SRTM data using Google Earth Engine. Our results demonstrate that
fine-tuning a publicly available remote sensing time series foundation model
outperforms the current state-of-the-art in NFI classification in the
Netherlands by a large margin of up to 10% across all datasets. This
demonstrates that classic hand-defined harmonic features are too simple for
this task and highlights the potential of using deep AI features for
data-limited application like NFI classification. By leveraging openly
available satellite data and pre-trained models, this approach significantly
improves classification accuracy compared to traditional methods and can
effectively complement existing forest inventory processes.

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary, low-intensity, and short-duration
facial expressions that often reveal an individual's genuine thoughts and
emotions. Most existing ME analysis methods rely on window-level classification
with fixed window sizes and hard decisions, which limits their ability to
capture the complex temporal dynamics of MEs. Although recent approaches have
adopted video-level regression frameworks to address some of these challenges,
interval decoding still depends on manually predefined, window-based methods,
leaving the issue only partially mitigated. In this paper, we propose a
prior-guided video-level regression method for ME analysis. We introduce a
scalable interval selection strategy that comprehensively considers the
temporal evolution, duration, and class distribution characteristics of MEs,
enabling precise spotting of the onset, apex, and offset phases. In addition,
we introduce a synergistic optimization framework, in which the spotting and
recognition tasks share parameters except for the classification heads. This
fully exploits complementary information, makes more efficient use of limited
data, and enhances the model's capability. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method,
with an STRS of 0.0562 on CAS(ME)$^3$ and 0.2000 on SAMMLV. The code is

Abstract: Microsurgical anastomosis demands exceptional dexterity and visuospatial
skills, underscoring the importance of comprehensive training and precise
outcome assessment. Currently, methods such as the outcome-oriented anastomosis
lapse index are used to evaluate this procedure. However, they often rely on
subjective judgment, which can introduce biases that affect the reliability and
efficiency of the assessment of competence. Leveraging three datasets from
hospitals with participants at various levels, we introduce a quantitative
framework that uses image-processing techniques for objective assessment of
microsurgical anastomoses. The approach uses geometric modeling of errors along
with a detection and scoring mechanism, enhancing the efficiency and
reliability of microsurgical proficiency assessment and advancing training
protocols. The results show that the geometric metrics effectively replicate
expert raters' scoring for the errors considered in this work.

Conclusion: 该方法能够让现代稳定器超越长期以来的SOTA方法，同时保持现代方法的全帧特性，并为用户提供类似于经典方法的控制机制。

Abstract: Video stabilization remains a fundamental problem in computer vision,
particularly pixel-level synthesis solutions for video stabilization, which
synthesize full-frame outputs, add to the complexity of this task. These
methods aim to enhance stability while synthesizing full-frame videos, but the
inherent diversity in motion profiles and visual content present in each video
sequence makes robust generalization with fixed parameters difficult. To
address this, we present a novel method that improves pixel-level synthesis
video stabilization methods by rapidly adapting models to each input video at
test time. The proposed approach takes advantage of low-level visual cues
available during inference to improve both the stability and visual quality of
the output. Notably, the proposed rapid adaptation achieves significant
performance gains even with a single adaptation pass. We further propose a jerk
localization module and a targeted adaptation strategy, which focuses the
adaptation on high-jerk segments for maximizing stability with fewer adaptation
steps. The proposed methodology enables modern stabilizers to overcome the
longstanding SOTA approaches while maintaining the full frame nature of the
modern methods, while offering users with control mechanisms akin to classical
approaches. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate
the versatility of the proposed method. Our approach consistently improves the
performance of various full-frame synthesis models in both qualitative and
quantitative terms, including results on downstream applications.

Conclusion: DualFairVL有效解决了医疗影像诊断中的跨模态公平性问题，为构建公平且鲁棒的医疗AI系统提供了有力解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness across demographic groups in medical diagnosis is essential
for equitable healthcare, particularly under distribution shifts caused by
variations in imaging equipment and clinical practice. Vision-language models
(VLMs) exhibit strong generalization, and text prompts encode identity
attributes, enabling explicit identification and removal of sensitive
directions. However, existing debiasing approaches typically address vision and
text modalities independently, leaving residual cross-modal misalignment and
fairness gaps. To address this challenge, we propose DualFairVL, a multimodal
prompt-learning framework that jointly debiases and aligns cross-modal
representations. DualFairVL employs a parallel dual-branch architecture that
separates sensitive and target attributes, enabling disentangled yet aligned
representations across modalities. Approximately orthogonal text anchors are
constructed via linear projections, guiding cross-attention mechanisms to
produce fused features. A hypernetwork further disentangles attribute-related
information and generates instance-aware visual prompts, which encode
dual-modal cues for fairness and robustness. Prototype-based regularization is
applied in the visual branch to enforce separation of sensitive features and
strengthen alignment with textual anchors. Extensive experiments on eight
medical imaging datasets across four modalities show that DualFairVL achieves
state-of-the-art fairness and accuracy under both in- and out-of-distribution
settings, outperforming full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient baselines with
only 3.6M trainable parameters. Code will be released upon publication.

Motivation: 现有DETR-based HOI检测模型使用随机初始化的查询导致表示模糊，限制了模型效果。人类在HOI类别中是固定的，而对象和交互是可变的，需要针对性地增强查询表示

Method: 1) 使用对象感知编码器特征增强对象查询，使模型能更有效地关注与对象交互的人类；2) 设计交互语义融合模块，利用CLIP模型提取语义特征增强交互查询初始化；3) 引入辅助预测单元改进交互特征表示

Conclusion: DQEN通过分别增强对象查询和交互查询的表示能力，有效提升了HOI检测的准确性，证明了查询增强策略在DETR-based HOI检测中的重要性

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection focuses on localizing human-object
pairs and recognizing their interactions. Recently, the DETR-based framework
has been widely adopted in HOI detection. In DETR-based HOI models, queries
with clear meaning are crucial for accurately detecting HOIs. However, prior
works have typically relied on randomly initialized queries, leading to vague
representations that limit the model's effectiveness. Meanwhile, humans in the
HOI categories are fixed, while objects and their interactions are variable.
Therefore, we propose a Dual Query Enhancement Network (DQEN) to enhance object
and interaction queries. Specifically, object queries are enhanced with
object-aware encoder features, enabling the model to focus more effectively on
humans interacting with objects in an object-aware way. On the other hand, we
design a novel Interaction Semantic Fusion module to exploit the HOI candidates
that are promoted by the CLIP model. Semantic features are extracted to enhance
the initialization of interaction queries, thereby improving the model's
ability to understand interactions. Furthermore, we introduce an Auxiliary
Prediction Unit aimed at improving the representation of interaction features.
Our proposed method achieves competitive performance on both the HICO-Det and
the V-COCO datasets. The source code is available at

Abstract: Trustworthy AI is mandatory for the broad deployment of autonomous vehicles.
Although end-to-end approaches derive control commands directly from raw data,
interpreting these decisions remains challenging, especially in complex urban
scenarios. This is mainly attributed to very deep neural networks with
non-linear decision boundaries, making it challenging to grasp the logic behind
AI-driven decisions. This paper presents a method to enhance interpretability
while optimizing control commands in autonomous driving. To address this, we
propose loss functions that promote the interpretability of our model by
generating sparse and localized feature maps. The feature activations allow us
to explain which image regions contribute to the predicted control command. We
conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the feature extraction step and
validate our method on the CARLA benchmarks. We also demonstrate that our
approach improves interpretability, which correlates with reducing infractions,
yielding a safer, high-performance driving model. Notably, our monocular,
non-ensemble model surpasses the top-performing approaches from the CARLA
Leaderboard by achieving lower infraction scores and the highest route

Abstract: The Event-Enriched Image Analysis (EVENTA) Grand Challenge, hosted at ACM
Multimedia 2025, introduces the first large-scale benchmark for event-level
multimodal understanding. Traditional captioning and retrieval tasks largely
focus on surface-level recognition of people, objects, and scenes, often
overlooking the contextual and semantic dimensions that define real-world
events. EVENTA addresses this gap by integrating contextual, temporal, and
semantic information to capture the who, when, where, what, and why behind an
image. Built upon the OpenEvents V1 dataset, the challenge features two tracks:
Event-Enriched Image Retrieval and Captioning, and Event-Based Image Retrieval.
A total of 45 teams from six countries participated, with evaluation conducted
through Public and Private Test phases to ensure fairness and reproducibility.
The top three teams were invited to present their solutions at ACM Multimedia
2025. EVENTA establishes a foundation for context-aware, narrative-driven
multimedia AI, with applications in journalism, media analysis, cultural
archiving, and accessibility. Further details about the challenge are available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个基于变换器模型的分类框架，用于区分群体和单个行人的轨迹数据，并建立了空间利用和行为模式的综合指标体系，为人群动力学研究奠定基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析群体和单个行人在空间利用和行为模式上的差异，以及他们在交互过程中出现的行为模式。

Method: 将行人轨迹分割成固定时间箱，使用基于Transformer的对分类模型识别维系群体和单个行人，并通过结构化序列筛选过程进行处理。建立包含空间利用指标（凸包面积、最小外接圆半径、热力图空间密度）和行为指标（速度变化、运动角偏差、清除半径、轨迹直线性）的综合指标体系。

Result: 建立了一个可扩展的分析框架，支持60、100和200帧的不同序列长度。还引入了遇见类型分类（单对单、单对群、群对群）来分类和量化不同的交互场景。

Conclusion: 这个初始框架为行人模拟和空间设计验证的深层次分析奠定了基础，未来将进行完整的定量分析和实质性研究。

Abstract: This study presents an initial framework for distinguishing group and single
pedestrians based on real-world trajectory data, with the aim of analyzing
their differences in space utilization and emergent behavioral patterns. By
segmenting pedestrian trajectories into fixed time bins and applying a
Transformer-based pair classification model, we identify cohesive groups and
isolate single pedestrians over a structured sequence-based filtering process.
To prepare for deeper analysis, we establish a comprehensive metric framework
incorporating both spatial and behavioral dimensions. Spatial utilization
metrics include convex hull area, smallest enclosing circle radius, and
heatmap-based spatial densities to characterize how different pedestrian types
occupy and interact with space. Behavioral metrics such as velocity change,
motion angle deviation, clearance radius, and trajectory straightness are
designed to capture local adaptations and responses during interactions.
Furthermore, we introduce a typology of encounter types-single-to-single,
single-to-group, and group-to-group to categorize and later quantify different
interaction scenarios. Although this version focuses primarily on the
classification pipeline and dataset structuring, it establishes the groundwork
for scalable analysis across different sequence lengths 60, 100, and 200
frames. Future versions will incorporate complete quantitative analysis of the
proposed metrics and their implications for pedestrian simulation and space
design validation in crowd dynamics research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大空间尺度珊瑚礁监测的挑战，航拍图像分辨率有限难以区分精细类别，而像素级标注成本高且劳动密集，限制了深度学习方法在航拍图像中的可扩展性

Method: 多尺度弱监督语义分割框架，结合基于分类的监督、空间插值和自蒸馏技术，从水下图像向航拍数据迁移精细尺度生态信息

Result: 方法有效实现了大区域珊瑚礁形态类型分割，展示了整合新类别的灵活性

Conclusion: 提出了可扩展、成本效益高的高分辨率珊瑚礁监测方法，结合低成本数据收集、弱监督深度学习和多尺度遥感技术

Abstract: Monitoring coral reefs at large spatial scales remains an open challenge,
essential for assessing ecosystem health and informing conservation efforts.
While drone-based aerial imagery offers broad spatial coverage, its limited
resolution makes it difficult to reliably distinguish fine-scale classes, such
as coral morphotypes. At the same time, obtaining pixel-level annotations over
large spatial extents is costly and labor-intensive, limiting the scalability
of deep learning-based segmentation methods for aerial imagery. We present a
multi-scale weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework that addresses
this challenge by transferring fine-scale ecological information from
underwater imagery to aerial data. Our method enables large-scale coral reef
mapping from drone imagery with minimal manual annotation, combining
classification-based supervision, spatial interpolation and self-distillation
techniques. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach, enabling large-area
segmentation of coral morphotypes and demonstrating flexibility for integrating
new classes. This study presents a scalable, cost-effective methodology for
high-resolution reef monitoring, combining low-cost data collection, weakly
supervised deep learning and multi-scale remote sensing.

Motivation: 传统GIS地图制作需要专业知识且耗时，生成式AI模型虽有帮助但在空间组成和语义布局上缺乏控制力

Method: 集成向量数据来指导地图生成，通过文本提示指定不同样式，并将模型集成到web应用中

Result: 第一个能够生成准确且可控样式地图的模型，用户研究证明其保真度和应用性，能够帮助专业人士和非专业用户更高效制作地图

Conclusion: 该研究展示了生成式AI在地图制作领域的潜力，需要进一步技术改进并重新定义制图师在AI协助制图新范式中的角色

Abstract: Traditional map-making relies heavily on Geographic Information Systems
(GIS), requiring domain expertise and being time-consuming, especially for
repetitive tasks. Recent advances in generative AI (GenAI), particularly image
diffusion models, offer new opportunities for automating and democratizing the
map-making process. However, these models struggle with accurate map creation
due to limited control over spatial composition and semantic layout. To address
this, we integrate vector data to guide map generation in different styles,
specified by the textual prompts. Our model is the first to generate accurate
maps in controlled styles, and we have integrated it into a web application to
improve its usability and accessibility. We conducted a user study with
professional cartographers to assess the fidelity of generated maps, the
usability of the web application, and the implications of ever-emerging GenAI
in map-making. The findings have suggested the potential of our developed
application and, more generally, the GenAI models in helping both non-expert
users and professionals in creating maps more efficiently. We have also
outlined further technical improvements and emphasized the new role of
cartographers to advance the paradigm of AI-assisted map-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将风格驱动和主体驱动生成视为两个独立任务，存在明显对立。作者认为两者可以统一，因为它们都涉及内容与风格的解耦和重组

Method: 1)构建大规模三元组数据集；2)引入解耦学习方案，通过风格对齐训练和内容-风格解耦训练两个互补目标；3)加入风格奖励学习范式SRL；4)发布首个联合评估基准USO-Bench

Result: 大量实验表明USO在主体一致性和风格相似性两个维度上都达到了开源模型的最先进性能

Conclusion: USO成功统一了风格驱动和主体驱动生成任务，证明了通过内容-风格解耦和重组可以实现两者的协同优化

Abstract: Existing literature typically treats style-driven and subject-driven
generation as two disjoint tasks: the former prioritizes stylistic similarity,
whereas the latter insists on subject consistency, resulting in an apparent
antagonism. We argue that both objectives can be unified under a single
framework because they ultimately concern the disentanglement and
re-composition of content and style, a long-standing theme in style-driven
research. To this end, we present USO, a Unified Style-Subject Optimized
customization model. First, we construct a large-scale triplet dataset
consisting of content images, style images, and their corresponding stylized
content images. Second, we introduce a disentangled learning scheme that
simultaneously aligns style features and disentangles content from style
through two complementary objectives, style-alignment training and
content-style disentanglement training. Third, we incorporate a style
reward-learning paradigm denoted as SRL to further enhance the model's
performance. Finally, we release USO-Bench, the first benchmark that jointly
evaluates style similarity and subject fidelity across multiple metrics.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that USO achieves state-of-the-art
performance among open-source models along both dimensions of subject
consistency and style similarity. Code and model:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种隐私保护的NeRF视觉定位方法，通过自监督分割标签替代RGB图像训练，既能保护隐私又能实现高精度定位


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NeRF方法在视觉定位中会编码精细场景细节，存在隐私泄露风险，特别是在云服务部署时敏感信息可能被恢复

Method: 提出ppNeSF（隐私保护神经分割场），使用自监督学习的分割标签而非RGB图像进行训练，分割标签足够粗糙以隐藏可识别细节，同时在3D空间中保持判别性

Result: ppNeSF的分割空间可用于精确的视觉定位，取得了最先进的结果，同时有效保护了隐私

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了NeRF在视觉定位中的隐私问题，为隐私保护的3D场景表示提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Visual localization (VL) is the task of estimating the camera pose in a known
scene. VL methods, a.o., can be distinguished based on how they represent the
scene, e.g., explicitly through a (sparse) point cloud or a collection of
images or implicitly through the weights of a neural network. Recently,
NeRF-based methods have become popular for VL. While NeRFs offer high-quality
novel view synthesis, they inadvertently encode fine scene details, raising
privacy concerns when deployed in cloud-based localization services as
sensitive information could be recovered. In this paper, we tackle this
challenge on two ends. We first propose a new protocol to assess
privacy-preservation of NeRF-based representations. We show that NeRFs trained
with photometric losses store fine-grained details in their geometry
representations, making them vulnerable to privacy attacks, even if the head
that predicts colors is removed. Second, we propose ppNeSF (Privacy-Preserving
Neural Segmentation Field), a NeRF variant trained with segmentation
supervision instead of RGB images. These segmentation labels are learned in a
self-supervised manner, ensuring they are coarse enough to obscure identifiable
scene details while remaining discriminativeness in 3D. The segmentation space
of ppNeSF can be used for accurate visual localization, yielding
state-of-the-art results.

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了在文档视觉问答中引入检索增强生成(RAG)的效果，通过文本检索和视觉检索两种方式，在多个多页文档数据集上显著提升了性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文档VQA系统要么拼接所有页面内容，要么依赖大型视觉语言模型，这两种方法都消耗大量内存。RAG提供了一种更高效的替代方案，通过先检索相关片段再生成答案

Method: 使用两种检索变体：基于OCR文本的检索和纯视觉检索（无需OCR），在MP-DocVQA、DUDE和InfographicVQA等多页数据集上进行评估，并分析了检索、重排序和布局引导分块策略的影响

Result: 文本中心变体比"拼接所有页面"基线提升了最多+22.5 ANLS，视觉变体在不需文本提取的情况下实现了+5.0 ANLS的改进。检索和重排序组件是性能提升的主要驱动力

Conclusion: 仔细的证据选择能够持续提升多种模型大小和多页基准测试的准确性，证明了其在真实世界文档VQA中的实用价值

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (Document VQA) must cope with documents
that span dozens of pages, yet leading systems still concatenate every page or
rely on very large vision-language models, both of which are memory-hungry.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an attractive alternative, first
retrieving a concise set of relevant segments before generating answers from
this selected evidence. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact of
incorporating RAG into Document VQA through different retrieval variants -
text-based retrieval using OCR tokens and purely visual retrieval without OCR -
across multiple models and benchmarks. Evaluated on the multi-page datasets
MP-DocVQA, DUDE, and InfographicVQA, the text-centric variant improves the
"concatenate-all-pages" baseline by up to +22.5 ANLS, while the visual variant
achieves +5.0 ANLS improvement without requiring any text extraction. An
ablation confirms that retrieval and reranking components drive most of the
gain, whereas the layout-guided chunking strategy - proposed in several recent
works to leverage page structure - fails to help on these datasets. Our
experiments demonstrate that careful evidence selection consistently boosts
accuracy across multiple model sizes and multi-page benchmarks, underscoring
its practical value for real-world Document VQA.

Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在现实应用中的广泛使用，理解其人口统计偏见变得至关重要，需要系统性的评估基准来量化这些偏见。

Method: 提出了GRAS基准测试，涵盖性别、种族、年龄和肤色四个维度，设计了GRAS偏见评分指标，并对5个最先进的视觉语言模型进行了评估，特别强调需要从多个问题表述角度评估VQA任务中的偏见。

Result: 测试结果显示所有模型都存在严重的偏见问题，表现最好的模型GRAS偏见评分仅为2分（满分100分），表明当前视觉语言模型在人口统计偏见方面存在显著缺陷。

Conclusion: GRAS基准测试揭示了视觉语言模型中存在严重的人口统计偏见，强调了在视觉问答任务中需要从多角度评估偏见的重要性，为模型偏见检测和缓解提供了重要工具和见解。

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) become integral to real-world applications,
understanding their demographic biases is critical. We introduce GRAS, a
benchmark for uncovering demographic biases in VLMs across gender, race, age,
and skin tone, offering the most diverse coverage to date. We further propose
the GRAS Bias Score, an interpretable metric for quantifying bias. We benchmark
five state-of-the-art VLMs and reveal concerning bias levels, with the least
biased model attaining a GRAS Bias Score of only 2 out of 100. Our findings
also reveal a methodological insight: evaluating bias in VLMs with visual
question answering (VQA) requires considering multiple formulations of a
question. Our code, data, and evaluation results are publicly available.

Method: 采用Transformer编码器-解码器框架，使用可学习平面查询预测实例掩码；设计边缘感知掩码模块(EAMM)增强边缘判别性；提出自适应权重掩码损失和平面几何损失

Result: 开发了RoofSeg网络，实现了真正的端到端屋顶平面分割，提升了边缘区域的准确性和整体分割质量

Conclusion: RoofSeg通过结合Transformer架构、边缘感知模块和几何约束，有效解决了当前屋顶分割方法的三个主要问题，为3D建筑重建提供了更精确的解决方案

Abstract: Roof plane segmentation is one of the key procedures for reconstructing
three-dimensional (3D) building models at levels of detail (LoD) 2 and 3 from
airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. The majority of
current approaches for roof plane segmentation rely on the manually designed or
learned features followed by some specifically designed geometric clustering
strategies. Because the learned features are more powerful than the manually
designed features, the deep learning-based approaches usually perform better
than the traditional approaches. However, the current deep learning-based
approaches have three unsolved problems. The first is that most of them are not
truly end-to-end, the plane segmentation results may be not optimal. The second
is that the point feature discriminability near the edges is relatively low,
leading to inaccurate planar edges. The third is that the planar geometric
characteristics are not sufficiently considered to constrain the network
training. To solve these issues, a novel edge-aware transformer-based network,
named RoofSeg, is developed for segmenting roof planes from LiDAR point clouds
in a truly end-to-end manner. In the RoofSeg, we leverage a transformer
encoder-decoder-based framework to hierarchically predict the plane instance
masks with the use of a set of learnable plane queries. To further improve the
segmentation accuracy of edge regions, we also design an Edge-Aware Mask Module
(EAMM) that sufficiently incorporates planar geometric prior of edges to
enhance its discriminability for plane instance mask refinement. In addition,
we propose an adaptive weighting strategy in the mask loss to reduce the
influence of misclassified points, and also propose a new plane geometric loss
to constrain the network training.

Conclusion: MicroDetect-Net模型通过深度学习与莖红染料染色的结合，为微塑料检测提供了高效准确的方案，将来有望应用于人体血液检测。

Abstract: With the prevalence of plastics exceeding 368 million tons yearly,
microplastic pollution has grown to an extent where air, water, soil, and
living organisms have all tested positive for microplastic presence. These
particles, which are smaller than 5 millimeters in size, are no less harmful to
humans than to the environment. Toxicity research on microplastics has shown
that exposure may cause liver infection, intestinal injuries, and gut flora
imbalance, leading to numerous potential health hazards. This paper presents a
new model, MicroDetect-Net (MDN), which applies fluorescence microscopy with
Nile Red dye staining and deep learning to scan blood samples for
microplastics. Although clam blood has certain limitations in replicating real
human blood, this study opens avenues for applying the approach to human
samples, which are more consistent for preliminary data collection. The MDN
model integrates dataset preparation, fluorescence imaging, and segmentation
using a convolutional neural network to localize and count microplastic
fragments. The combination of convolutional networks and Nile Red dye for
segmentation produced strong image detection and accuracy. MDN was evaluated on
a dataset of 276 Nile Red-stained fluorescent blood images and achieved an
accuracy of ninety two percent. Robust performance was observed with an
Intersection over Union of 87.4 percent, F1 score of 92.1 percent, Precision of
90.6 percent, and Recall of 93.7 percent. These metrics demonstrate the
effectiveness of MDN in the detection of microplastics.

Conclusion: ProPy通过系统架构适配CLIP，有效解决了部分相关视频检索任务，证明了预训练模型在该领域的潜力

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) is a practical yet challenging task
that involves retrieving videos based on queries relevant to only specific
segments. While existing works follow the paradigm of developing models to
process unimodal features, powerful pretrained vision-language models like CLIP
remain underexplored in this field. To bridge this gap, we propose ProPy, a
model with systematic architectural adaption of CLIP specifically designed for
PRVR. Drawing insights from the semantic relevance of multi-granularity events,
ProPy introduces two key innovations: (1) A Prompt Pyramid structure that
organizes event prompts to capture semantics at multiple granularity levels,
and (2) An Ancestor-Descendant Interaction Mechanism built on the pyramid that
enables dynamic semantic interaction among events. With these designs, ProPy
achieves SOTA performance on three public datasets, outperforming previous
models by significant margins. Code is available at

Motivation: 医学领域利用大数据进行病人养护具有广阔前景，但集聚足够大的数据集训练模型极具挑战。需要通过自监督预训练和基础模型来解决数据稀缺问题。

Method: 使用8449个3D血管几何模型构成的大规模数据集，通过计算热内核签名（利用拉普拉斯本征向量获得）创建自监督目标，学习几何表征。然后将这些表征应用于小规模临床试验（49名病人）的冠状动脉壁剪切应力分割。

Conclusion: 通过自监督预训练在大规模几何数据集上学习的表征，可以有效解决医学图像数据稀缺问题，显著提高血流动力学生物标记物评估的性能。

Abstract: Leveraging big data for patient care is promising in many medical fields such
as cardiovascular health. For example, hemodynamic biomarkers like wall shear
stress could be assessed from patient-specific medical images via machine
learning algorithms, bypassing the need for time-intensive computational fluid
simulation. However, it is extremely challenging to amass large-enough datasets
to effectively train such models. We could address this data scarcity by means
of self-supervised pre-training and foundations models given large datasets of
geometric artery models. In the context of coronary arteries, leveraging
learned representations to improve hemodynamic biomarker assessment has not yet
been well studied. In this work, we address this gap by investigating whether a
large dataset (8449 shapes) consisting of geometric models of 3D blood vessels
can benefit wall shear stress assessment in coronary artery models from a
small-scale clinical trial (49 patients). We create a self-supervised target
for the 3D blood vessels by computing the heat kernel signature, a quantity
obtained via Laplacian eigenvectors, which captures the very essence of the
shapes. We show how geometric representations learned from this datasets can
boost segmentation of coronary arteries into regions of low, mid and high
(time-averaged) wall shear stress even when trained on limited data.

Conclusion: SuperSimpleNet通过统一多样化监督范式，在保持出色速度和可靠性的同时，为解决实际制造挑战和弥合学术研究与工业应用之间的差距迈出了有希望的一步。

Abstract: Surface defect detection is a critical task across numerous industries, aimed
at efficiently identifying and localising imperfections or irregularities on
manufactured components. While numerous methods have been proposed, many fail
to meet industrial demands for high performance, efficiency, and adaptability.
Existing approaches are often constrained to specific supervision scenarios and
struggle to adapt to the diverse data annotations encountered in real-world
manufacturing processes, such as unsupervised, weakly supervised, mixed
supervision, and fully supervised settings. To address these challenges, we
propose SuperSimpleNet, a highly efficient and adaptable discriminative model
built on the foundation of SimpleNet. SuperSimpleNet incorporates a novel
synthetic anomaly generation process, an enhanced classification head, and an
improved learning procedure, enabling efficient training in all four

Abstract: Single-Pixel Imaging enables reconstructing objects using a single detector
through sequential illuminations with structured light patterns. We propose a
bilevel optimisation method for learning task-specific, binary illumination
patterns, optimised for applications like single-pixel fluorescence microscopy.
We address the non-differentiable nature of binary pattern optimisation using
the Straight-Through Estimator and leveraging a Total Deep Variation
regulariser in the bilevel formulation. We demonstrate our method on the
CytoImageNet microscopy dataset and show that learned patterns achieve superior
reconstruction performance compared to baseline methods, especially in highly
undersampled regimes.

<details>

Motivation: 事件盘在固定光照条件和静态/低运动场景不能产生事件，限制了计算机视觉任务的应用，需要一种轻量级方案来持续产生事件

Method: 采用简单的旋转不平衡质量产生周期性震动，结合运动补偿管线去除注入的运动，获得清洁的运动筛除事件

Result: 在硬件原型和实际采集数据集上验证，方法可靠地恢复运动参数，在图像重建和边缘检测任务上都显著提升了性能

Conclusion: 该轻量级震动注入方法有效解决了事件盘在静态场景中的限制，为下游感知任务提供了清洁的运动筛除事件数据

Abstract: Event cameras are a bio-inspired class of sensors that asynchronously measure
per-pixel intensity changes. Under fixed illumination conditions in static or
low-motion scenes, rigidly mounted event cameras are unable to generate any
events, becoming unsuitable for most computer vision tasks. To address this
limitation, recent work has investigated motion-induced event stimulation that
often requires complex hardware or additional optical components. In contrast,
we introduce a lightweight approach to sustain persistent event generation by
employing a simple rotating unbalanced mass to induce periodic vibrational
motion. This is combined with a motion-compensation pipeline that removes the
injected motion and yields clean, motion-corrected events for downstream
perception tasks. We demonstrate our approach with a hardware prototype and
evaluate it on real-world captured datasets. Our method reliably recovers
motion parameters and improves both image reconstruction and edge detection
over event-based sensing without motion induction.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种采用轻量UNet++网络和拓扑感知损失函数的少样本学习方法，在历史文档文本行分割任务中实现了更高的准确性和数据效率。该方法仅需三个注释页面就能超越现有最佳方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史文档的文本行分割需要大量注释数据，而注释过程需要专家知识且成本高。少样本学习能够有效减少数据需求，但现有深度学习模型通常复杂且效果不佳。

Method: 采用轻量UNet++网络结构，结合初始为神经元形态开发的连通性感知损失函数，显式惩罚线条碎片化和错误合并等结构错误。从每个手稿仅提取三个注释页面的小补丁进行训练。

Result: 在U-DIADS-TL数据集上，识别准确率提高了200%，行交并比提高了75%。在DIVA-HisDB基准检测任务中，F-Measure分数达到或超过竞赛冠军水平，仅需三个注释页面。

Conclusion: 小型简单的网络结构结合拓扑感知损失函数，能够在少样本情况下实现更高的准确性和数据效率，为历史文档数字化分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: A foundational task for the digital analysis of documents is text line
segmentation. However, automating this process with deep learning models is
challenging because it requires large, annotated datasets that are often
unavailable for historical documents. Additionally, the annotation process is a
labor- and cost-intensive task that requires expert knowledge, which makes
few-shot learning a promising direction for reducing data requirements. In this
work, we demonstrate that small and simple architectures, coupled with a
topology-aware loss function, are more accurate and data-efficient than more
complex alternatives. We pair a lightweight UNet++ with a connectivity-aware
loss, initially developed for neuron morphology, which explicitly penalizes
structural errors like line fragmentation and unintended line merges. To
increase our limited data, we train on small patches extracted from a mere
three annotated pages per manuscript. Our methodology significantly improves
upon the current state-of-the-art on the U-DIADS-TL dataset, with a 200%
increase in Recognition Accuracy and a 75% increase in Line Intersection over
Union. Our method also achieves an F-Measure score on par with or even
exceeding that of the competition winner of the DIVA-HisDB baseline detection
task, all while requiring only three annotated pages, exemplifying the efficacy
of our approach. Our implementation is publicly available at:

TL;DR: 本文针对单目3D视觉定位任务中预训练语言模型对数值单位不敏感的问题，提出了3D文本增强和文本引导几何增强两种方法，显著提升了模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现文本嵌入对数值大小敏感但忽略测量单位，导致即使物理长度相同但单位不同时性能严重下降，表明预训练语言模型在3D理解方面存在缺陷

Method: 提出3D文本增强(3DTE)预处理方法增强不同单位间的映射关系理解，以及文本引导几何增强(TGE)模块将文本特征投影到几何一致空间来增强3D-文本信息

Result: 在Mono3DRefer数据集上实现了显著改进，在"Far"场景中获得11.94%的准确率提升，达到新的最先进水平

Conclusion: 通过增强文本嵌入的3D感知能力和几何特征，有效解决了预训练语言模型在3D理解方面的局限性，为单目3D视觉定位任务提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Monocular 3D visual grounding is a novel task that aims to locate 3D objects
in RGB images using text descriptions with explicit geometry information.
Despite the inclusion of geometry details in the text, we observe that the text
embeddings are sensitive to the magnitude of numerical values but largely
ignore the associated measurement units. For example, simply equidistant
mapping the length with unit "meter" to "decimeters" or "centimeters" leads to
severe performance degradation, even though the physical length remains
equivalent. This observation signifies the weak 3D comprehension of pre-trained
language model, which generates misguiding text features to hinder 3D
perception. Therefore, we propose to enhance the 3D perception of model on text
embeddings and geometry features with two simple and effective methods.
Firstly, we introduce a pre-processing method named 3D-text Enhancement (3DTE),
which enhances the comprehension of mapping relationships between different
units by augmenting the diversity of distance descriptors in text queries.
Next, we propose a Text-Guided Geometry Enhancement (TGE) module to further
enhance the 3D-text information by projecting the basic text features into
geometrically consistent space. These 3D-enhanced text features are then
leveraged to precisely guide the attention of geometry features. We evaluate
the proposed method through extensive comparisons and ablation studies on the
Mono3DRefer dataset. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements
over previous methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results with a notable
accuracy gain of 11.94\% in the "Far" scenario. Our code will be made publicly
available.

*Zhihang Xin,Xitong Hu,Rui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WEF-PE是一种基于椭圆函数的二维位置编码方法，解决了传统ViT中一维位置编码破坏图像空间结构的问题，在多个视觉任务上实现了性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Vision Transformer使用的一维位置编码破坏了图像的二维空间结构，缺乏几何约束，无法有效利用空间邻近先验信息。

Method: 提出Weierstrass椭圆函数位置编码(WEF-PE)，利用椭圆函数的双周期性和非线性几何特性，在复数域中直接表示二维坐标，通过代数加法公式推导相对位置信息。

Result: 在CIFAR-100上ViT-Tiny从头训练达到63.78%准确率，ViT-Base微调达到93.28%，在VTAB-1k基准任务上持续改进，理论分析证实了距离衰减特性。

Conclusion: WEF-PE通过数学原理化的方法有效编码二维空间关系，增强了模型的几何归纳偏置，在多个视觉任务上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Vision Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in computer vision
tasks, yet their reliance on learnable one-dimensional positional embeddings
fundamentally disrupts the inherent two-dimensional spatial structure of images
through patch flattening procedures. Traditional positional encoding approaches
lack geometric constraints and fail to establish monotonic correspondence
between Euclidean spatial distances and sequential index distances, thereby
limiting the model's capacity to leverage spatial proximity priors effectively.
We propose Weierstrass Elliptic Function Positional Encoding (WEF-PE), a
mathematically principled approach that directly addresses two-dimensional
coordinates through natural complex domain representation, where the doubly
periodic properties of elliptic functions align remarkably with translational
invariance patterns commonly observed in visual data. Our method exploits the
non-linear geometric nature of elliptic functions to encode spatial distance
relationships naturally, while the algebraic addition formula enables direct
derivation of relative positional information between arbitrary patch pairs
from their absolute encodings. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
WEF-PE achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios, including
63.78\% accuracy on CIFAR-100 from-scratch training with ViT-Tiny architecture,
93.28\% on CIFAR-100 fine-tuning with ViT-Base, and consistent improvements on
VTAB-1k benchmark tasks. Theoretical analysis confirms the distance-decay
property through rigorous mathematical proof, while attention visualization
reveals enhanced geometric inductive bias and more coherent semantic focus
compared to conventional approaches.The source code implementing the methods
described in this paper is publicly available on GitHub.

Conclusion: 分离顶点和面片的生成框架能够有效减少网格表示的冗余，实现了更高效和高质量的艺术网格生成

Abstract: Recent mesh generation approaches typically tokenize triangle meshes into
sequences of tokens and train autoregressive models to generate these tokens
sequentially. Despite substantial progress, such token sequences inevitably
reuse vertices multiple times to fully represent manifold meshes, as each
vertex is shared by multiple faces. This redundancy leads to excessively long
token sequences and inefficient generation processes. In this paper, we propose
an efficient framework that generates artistic meshes by treating vertices and
faces separately, significantly reducing redundancy. We employ an
autoregressive model solely for vertex generation, decreasing the token count
to approximately 23\% of that required by the most compact existing tokenizer.
Next, we leverage a bidirectional transformer to complete the mesh in a single
step by capturing inter-vertex relationships and constructing the adjacency
matrix that defines the mesh faces. To further improve the generation quality,
we introduce a fidelity enhancer to refine vertex positioning into more natural
arrangements and propose a post-processing framework to remove undesirable edge
connections. Experimental results show that our method achieves more than
8$\times$ faster speed on mesh generation compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, while producing higher mesh quality.

Motivation: 解决T2I模型在人脸等细节丰富内容的属性细粒度操控问题，免除传统One-for-One方式导致的参数冗余和扩展性不足。

Method: 训练轻量级全能滑桶模块，将文本嵌入空间分解为稀疏、语义明确的属性方向，支持多属性细粒度控制和新属性零样本操控。

Result: 实验结果显示该方法能够实现准确和可扩展的属性操控，较之以往方法有显著提升，并能与逆向框架集成处理真实图像。

Conclusion: All-in-One Slider为T2I模型提供了一种轻量、可解释、可扩展的属性操控方案，拓展了在实际应用场景中的适用性。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant strides in
generating high-quality images. However, progressively manipulating certain
attributes of generated images to meet the desired user expectations remains
challenging, particularly for content with rich details, such as human faces.
Some studies have attempted to address this by training slider modules.
However, they follow a One-for-One manner, where an independent slider is
trained for each attribute, requiring additional training whenever a new
attribute is introduced. This not only results in parameter redundancy
accumulated by sliders but also restricts the flexibility of practical
applications and the scalability of attribute manipulation. To address this
issue, we introduce the All-in-One Slider, a lightweight module that decomposes
the text embedding space into sparse, semantically meaningful attribute
directions. Once trained, it functions as a general-purpose slider, enabling
interpretable and fine-grained continuous control over various attributes.
Moreover, by recombining the learned directions, the All-in-One Slider supports
zero-shot manipulation of unseen attributes (e.g., races and celebrities) and
the composition of multiple attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method enables accurate and scalable attribute manipulation, achieving
notable improvements compared to previous methods. Furthermore, our method can
be extended to integrate with the inversion framework to perform attribute
manipulation on real images, broadening its applicability to various real-world
scenarios. The code and trained model will be released at:

Abstract: Large-scale scene data is essential for training and testing in robot
learning. Neural reconstruction methods have promised the capability of
reconstructing large physically-grounded outdoor scenes from captured sensor
data. However, these methods have baked-in static environments and only allow
for limited scene control -- they are functionally constrained in scene and
trajectory diversity by the captures from which they are reconstructed. In
contrast, generating driving data with recent image or video diffusion models
offers control, however, at the cost of geometry grounding and causality. In
this work, we aim to bridge this gap and present a method that directly
generates large-scale 3D driving scenes with accurate geometry, allowing for
causal novel view synthesis with object permanence and explicit 3D geometry
estimation. The proposed method combines the generation of a proxy geometry and
environment representation with score distillation from learned 2D image
priors. We find that this approach allows for high controllability, enabling
the prompt-guided geometry and high-fidelity texture and structure that can be
conditioned on map layouts -- producing realistic and geometrically consistent
3D generations of complex driving scenes.

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合高级语义指导和专门的多模态融合架构，成功生成了不仅物理合理而且语义连贯、富有表现力的角色动画，超越了传统的节奏同步方法。

Abstract: Existing video avatar models can produce fluid human animations, yet they
struggle to move beyond mere physical likeness to capture a character's
authentic essence. Their motions typically synchronize with low-level cues like
audio rhythm, lacking a deeper semantic understanding of emotion, intent, or
context. To bridge this gap, \textbf{we propose a framework designed to
generate character animations that are not only physically plausible but also
semantically coherent and expressive.} Our model, \textbf{OmniHuman-1.5}, is
built upon two key technical contributions. First, we leverage Multimodal Large
Language Models to synthesize a structured textual representation of conditions
that provides high-level semantic guidance. This guidance steers our motion
generator beyond simplistic rhythmic synchronization, enabling the production
of actions that are contextually and emotionally resonant. Second, to ensure
the effective fusion of these multimodal inputs and mitigate inter-modality
conflicts, we introduce a specialized Multimodal DiT architecture with a novel
Pseudo Last Frame design. The synergy of these components allows our model to
accurately interpret the joint semantics of audio, images, and text, thereby
generating motions that are deeply coherent with the character, scene, and
linguistic content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves
leading performance across a comprehensive set of metrics, including lip-sync
accuracy, video quality, motion naturalness and semantic consistency with
textual prompts. Furthermore, our approach shows remarkable extensibility to
complex scenarios, such as those involving multi-person and non-human subjects.

Conclusion: 这项工作推动了自动化纳米材料表征的进步，弥合了基于物理的模型与实验观察之间的差距，实现了CNT合成的实时优化。

Abstract: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are critical building blocks in nanotechnology, yet
the characterization of their dynamic growth is limited by the experimental
challenges in nanoscale motion measurement using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) imaging. Existing ex situ methods offer only static analysis, while in
situ techniques often require manual initialization and lack continuous
per-particle trajectory decomposition. We present Visual Feature Tracking
(VFTrack) an in-situ real-time particle tracking framework that automatically
detects and tracks individual CNT particles in SEM image sequences. VFTrack
integrates handcrafted or deep feature detectors and matchers within a particle
tracking framework to enable kinematic analysis of CNT micropillar growth. A
systematic using 13,540 manually annotated trajectories identifies the ALIKED
detector with LightGlue matcher as an optimal combination (F1-score of 0.78,
$\alpha$-score of 0.89). VFTrack motion vectors decomposed into axial growth,
lateral drift, and oscillations, facilitate the calculation of heterogeneous
regional growth rates and the reconstruction of evolving CNT pillar
morphologies. This work enables advancement in automated nano-material
characterization, bridging the gap between physics-based models and
experimental observation to enable real-time optimization of CNT synthesis.

Abstract: Recent video foundation models such as SAM2 excel at prompted video
segmentation by treating masks as a general-purpose primitive. However, many
real-world settings require unprompted segmentation that aims to detect and
track all objects in a video without external cues, leaving today's landscape
fragmented across task-specific models and pipelines. We recast streaming video
segmentation as sequential mask prediction, analogous to language modeling, and
introduce the Autoregressive Universal Segmentation Model (AUSM), a single
architecture that unifies both prompted and unprompted video segmentation.
Built on recent state-space models, AUSM maintains a fixed-size spatial state
and scales to video streams of arbitrary length. Furthermore, all components of
AUSM are designed for parallel training across frames, yielding substantial
speedups over iterative training. On standard benchmarks (DAVIS17, YouTube-VOS
2018 & 2019, MOSE, YouTube-VIS 2019 & 2021, and OVIS) AUSM outperforms prior
universal streaming video segmentation methods and achieves up to 2.5x faster
training on 16-frame sequences.

Method: 提出了Style4D框架，基于4D高斯溅射技术，包含三个关键组件：基础4DGS场景表示、风格高斯表示（使用轻量级MLP进行时空感知外观控制）和整体几何保持风格转移模块（通过对比一致性学习和结构内容保持增强时空一致性）。

Result: 在Style4D-Bench上的广泛实验表明，Style4D在4D风格化方面实现了最先进的性能，能够生成具有稳定时间动态和一致多视图渲染的细粒度风格细节。

Conclusion: Style4D-Bench有望成为动态3D场景风格化渲染研究中宝贵的基准资源，推动该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: We introduce Style4D-Bench, the first benchmark suite specifically designed
for 4D stylization, with the goal of standardizing evaluation and facilitating
progress in this emerging area. Style4D-Bench comprises: 1) a comprehensive
evaluation protocol measuring spatial fidelity, temporal coherence, and
multi-view consistency through both perceptual and quantitative metrics, 2) a
strong baseline that make an initial attempt for 4D stylization, and 3) a
curated collection of high-resolution dynamic 4D scenes with diverse motions
and complex backgrounds. To establish a strong baseline, we present Style4D, a
novel framework built upon 4D Gaussian Splatting. It consists of three key
components: a basic 4DGS scene representation to capture reliable geometry, a
Style Gaussian Representation that leverages lightweight per-Gaussian MLPs for
temporally and spatially aware appearance control, and a Holistic
Geometry-Preserved Style Transfer module designed to enhance spatio-temporal
consistency via contrastive coherence learning and structural content
preservation. Extensive experiments on Style4D-Bench demonstrate that Style4D
achieves state-of-the-art performance in 4D stylization, producing fine-grained
stylistic details with stable temporal dynamics and consistent multi-view
rendering. We expect Style4D-Bench to become a valuable resource for
benchmarking and advancing research in stylized rendering of dynamic 3D scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Articulate3D是一种无需训练的方法，通过语言控制来调整3D资产的姿态。该方法通过修改图像生成器创建目标图像，然后通过多视角姿态优化将网格与目标图像对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉和语言模型有所进展，但通过语言控制来调整3D资产姿态仍然具有挑战性。需要一种能够保持网格原始身份的同时实现自由形式文本提示控制的方法。

Method: 1）使用自注意力重布线机制（RSActrl）在图像生成模型中解耦源结构和姿态；2）通过关键点建立输入图像和目标图像之间的对应关系；3）进行多视角姿态优化，避免使用不可靠的可微分渲染信号。

Result: 该方法在多种3D对象和自由形式文本提示上表现有效，成功操纵姿态的同时保持网格的原始身份。定量评估和用户研究表明，该方法在85%的情况下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Articulate3D提供了一种有效的训练自由方法，能够通过语言指令精确控制3D资产的姿态，在保持结构一致性和身份完整性方面表现出色。

Abstract: We propose a training-free method, Articulate3D, to pose a 3D asset through
language control. Despite advances in vision and language models, this task
remains surprisingly challenging. To achieve this goal, we decompose the
problem into two steps. We modify a powerful image-generator to create target
images conditioned on the input image and a text instruction. We then align the
mesh to the target images through a multi-view pose optimisation step. In
detail, we introduce a self-attention rewiring mechanism (RSActrl) that
decouples the source structure from pose within an image generative model,
allowing it to maintain a consistent structure across varying poses. We
observed that differentiable rendering is an unreliable signal for articulation
optimisation; instead, we use keypoints to establish correspondences between
input and target images. The effectiveness of Articulate3D is demonstrated
across a diverse range of 3D objects and free-form text prompts, successfully
manipulating poses while maintaining the original identity of the mesh.
Quantitative evaluations and a comparative user study, in which our method was
preferred over 85\% of the time, confirm its superiority over existing
approaches. Project page:https://odeb1.github.io/articulate3d_page_deb/

TL;DR: VoxHammer是一种无需训练的3D编辑方法，通过在3D潜在空间中保留未编辑区域的特征来实现精确且连贯的编辑，显著优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有3D编辑方法在保持未编辑区域精确性和整体连贯性方面的挑战，为游戏产业和机器人交互提供更好的3D局部编辑方案

Method: 首先预测3D模型的反转轨迹获取反转潜在表示和键值标记，然后在去噪编辑阶段用这些特征替换保留区域的去噪特征，确保未编辑区域的一致性重建

Result: 在Edit3D-Bench数据集上的实验表明，VoxHammer在保留区域的3D一致性和整体质量方面显著优于现有方法

Conclusion: 该方法为合成高质量编辑配对数据提供了可能，为上下文3D生成奠定了数据基础

Abstract: 3D local editing of specified regions is crucial for game industry and robot
interaction. Recent methods typically edit rendered multi-view images and then
reconstruct 3D models, but they face challenges in precisely preserving
unedited regions and overall coherence. Inspired by structured 3D generative
models, we propose VoxHammer, a novel training-free approach that performs
precise and coherent editing in 3D latent space. Given a 3D model, VoxHammer
first predicts its inversion trajectory and obtains its inverted latents and
key-value tokens at each timestep. Subsequently, in the denoising and editing
phase, we replace the denoising features of preserved regions with the
corresponding inverted latents and cached key-value tokens. By retaining these
contextual features, this approach ensures consistent reconstruction of
preserved areas and coherent integration of edited parts. To evaluate the
consistency of preserved regions, we constructed Edit3D-Bench, a
human-annotated dataset comprising hundreds of samples, each with carefully
labeled 3D editing regions. Experiments demonstrate that VoxHammer
significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both 3D consistency of
preserved regions and overall quality. Our method holds promise for
synthesizing high-quality edited paired data, thereby laying the data
foundation for in-context 3D generation. See our project page at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电磁信号与文本图像差异大，具有高度异构性、强背景噪声和复杂时频结构，现有通用模型无法直接使用，且缺乏跨任务泛化和高质量数据集。

Method: 构建首个统一标准化电磁信号数据集，采用长度自适应多信号打包方法和硬件感知训练策略，利用电磁信号物理特性进行表示学习。

Conclusion: EMind成功建立了电磁信号基础模型，为动态频谱管理、智能交通等领域提供了统一的处理框架，代码已开源。

Abstract: Deep understanding of electromagnetic signals is fundamental to dynamic
spectrum management, intelligent transportation, autonomous driving and
unmanned vehicle perception. The field faces challenges because electromagnetic
signals differ greatly from text and images, showing high heterogeneity, strong
background noise and complex joint time frequency structure, which prevents
existing general models from direct use. Electromagnetic communication and
sensing tasks are diverse, current methods lack cross task generalization and
transfer efficiency, and the scarcity of large high quality datasets blocks the
creation of a truly general multitask learning framework. To overcome these
issue, we introduce EMind, an electromagnetic signals foundation model that
bridges large scale pretraining and the unique nature of this modality. We
build the first unified and largest standardized electromagnetic signal dataset
covering multiple signal types and tasks. By exploiting the physical properties
of electromagnetic signals, we devise a length adaptive multi-signal packing
method and a hardware-aware training strategy that enable efficient use and
representation learning from heterogeneous multi-source signals. Experiments
show that EMind achieves strong performance and broad generalization across
many downstream tasks, moving decisively from task specific models to a unified
framework for electromagnetic intelligence. The code is available at:

*Edgar Rangel,Fabio Martinez*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于联邦学习的协作框架，用于分宿网络分割缩阵性脑梗塌痕，解决了单一机构数据资源有限和模型普遍性差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑梗塌是全球第二大死因和第三大殚病原因，但临床痕迹分析存在巨大变异性。现有计算方法通常只能在单一机构数据上训练，缺乏普适性，而许多医院缺乏足够的标签数据来调整这些专门解决方案。

Method: 研究开发了一种协作框架，通过分享深度中心独立表征来分割缩阵性脑梗塌痕迹。从14个模拟健康中心的2031个研究中，采用FedAvg模型进行联邦学习训练。

Result: FedAvg模型在所有中心达到了DSC为0.71±0.24，AVD为5.29±22.74，ALD为2.16±3.60，LF1为0.70±0.26，表现超过了集中式和其他联邦规则。模型显示出强大的普适性，在不同痕迹类别上都有均匀表现，并在分布外中心也有可靠表现（DSC为0.64±0.29，AVD为4.44±8.74，无需额外训练）。

Conclusion: 该协作框架通过联邦学习技术，有效解决了医疗机构数据封闭和标签数据缺乏的挑战，实现了在保护数据隐私的同时提升模型普适性和性能，为医疗人工智能领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of
disability worldwide. Clinical guidelines establish diffusion resonance imaging
(DWI, ADC) as the standard for localizing, characterizing, and measuring
infarct volume, enabling treatment support and prognosis. Nonetheless, such
lesion analysis is highly variable due to different patient demographics,
scanner vendors, and expert annotations. Computational support approaches have
been key to helping with the localization and segmentation of lesions. However,
these strategies are dedicated solutions that learn patterns from only one
institution, lacking the variability to generalize geometrical lesions shape
models. Even worse, many clinical centers lack sufficient labeled samples to
adjust these dedicated solutions. This work developed a collaborative framework
for segmenting ischemic stroke lesions in DWI sequences by sharing knowledge
from deep center-independent representations. From 14 emulated healthcare
centers with 2031 studies, the FedAvg model achieved a general DSC of $0.71 \pm
0.24$, AVD of $5.29 \pm 22.74$, ALD of $2.16 \pm 3.60$ and LF1 of $0.70 \pm
0.26$ over all centers, outperforming both the centralized and other federated
rules. Interestingly, the model demonstrated strong generalization properties,
showing uniform performance across different lesion categories and reliable
performance in out-of-distribution centers (with DSC of $0.64 \pm 0.29$ and AVD
of $4.44 \pm 8.74$ without any additional training).

Abstract: The development of artificial intelligence models for macular edema (ME)
analy-sis always relies on expert-annotated pixel-level image datasets which
are expen-sive to collect prospectively. While anomaly-detection-based
weakly-supervised methods have shown promise in edema area (EA) segmentation
task, their per-formance still lags behind fully-supervised approaches. In this
paper, we leverage the strong correlation between EA and retinal layers in
spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images, along with the
update characteristics of weakly-supervised learning, to enhance an
off-the-shelf adversarial framework for EA segmentation with a novel
layer-structure-guided post-processing step and a test-time-adaptation (TTA)
strategy. By incorporating additional retinal lay-er information, our framework
reframes the dense EA prediction task as one of confirming intersection points
between the EA contour and retinal layers, result-ing in predictions that
better align with the shape prior of EA. Besides, the TTA framework further
helps address discrepancies in the manifestations and presen-tations of EA
between training and test sets. Extensive experiments on two pub-licly
available datasets demonstrate that these two proposed ingredients can im-prove
the accuracy and robustness of EA segmentation, bridging the gap between
weakly-supervised and fully-supervised models.

Method: 比较7种分割方法，特别关注单阶段方法（重建与分割统一）与两阶段方法（先使用成熟重建方法，再用分割网络）的对比。使用包含多线圈k空间数据和人工标注分割ground-truth的两个MRI数据集

Result: 考虑数据一致性的简单两阶段方法获得了最佳分割分数，超越了专门为此任务开发的复杂方法

Conclusion: 对于欠采样MRI数据的分割任务，简单的两阶段方法优于复杂的单阶段专门方法，数据一致性是关键因素

Abstract: MR imaging is a valuable diagnostic tool allowing to non-invasively visualize
patient anatomy and pathology with high soft-tissue contrast. However, MRI
acquisition is typically time-consuming, leading to patient discomfort and
increased costs to the healthcare system. Recent years have seen substantial
research effort into the development of methods that allow for accelerated MRI
acquisition while still obtaining a reconstruction that appears similar to the
fully-sampled MR image. However, for many applications a perfectly
reconstructed MR image may not be necessary, particularly, when the primary
goal is a downstream task such as segmentation. This has led to growing
interest in methods that aim to perform segmentation directly on accelerated
MRI data. Despite recent advances, existing methods have largely been developed
in isolation, without direct comparison to one another, often using separate or
private datasets, and lacking unified evaluation standards. To date, no
high-quality, comprehensive comparison of these methods exists, and the optimal
strategy for segmenting accelerated MR data remains unknown. This paper
provides the first unified benchmark for the segmentation of undersampled MRI
data comparing 7 approaches. A particular focus is placed on comparing
\textit{one-stage approaches}, that combine reconstruction and segmentation
into a unified model, with \textit{two-stage approaches}, that utilize
established MRI reconstruction methods followed by a segmentation network. We
test these methods on two MRI datasets that include multi-coil k-space data as
well as a human-annotated segmentation ground-truth. We find that simple
two-stage methods that consider data-consistency lead to the best segmentation
scores, surpassing complex specialized methods that are developed specifically
for this task.

TL;DR: RDDM是一种直接在传感器RAW数据上工作的端到端扩散模型，通过RAW域VAE和可微分后色调处理模块，解决了传统sRGB域扩散模型的高保真度与真实生成之间的困境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有sRGB域扩散模型处理有损的sRGB输入，忽略了传感器RAW图像在许多场景（如边缘设备图像采集）中的可访问性，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出RAW域VAE学习最优潜在表示，可微分后色调处理模块实现RAW和sRGB空间联合优化，构建可扩展退化管道合成RAW LQ-HQ对，并设计可配置多拜耳LoRA模块处理不同RAW模式。

Result: 大量实验证明RDDM优于最先进的sRGB扩散方法，能以更少的伪影产生更高保真度的结果。

Conclusion: RDDM通过直接在RAW域工作，成功解决了传统方法的局限性，为图像恢复提供了新的端到端解决方案。

Abstract: We present the RAW domain diffusion model (RDDM), an end-to-end diffusion
model that restores photo-realistic images directly from the sensor RAW data.
While recent sRGB-domain diffusion methods achieve impressive results, they are
caught in a dilemma between high fidelity and realistic generation. As these
models process lossy sRGB inputs and neglect the accessibility of the sensor
RAW images in many scenarios, e.g., in image and video capturing in edge
devices, resulting in sub-optimal performance. RDDM bypasses this limitation by
directly restoring images in the RAW domain, replacing the conventional
two-stage image signal processing (ISP) + IR pipeline. However, a simple
adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models to the RAW domain confronts the
out-of-distribution (OOD) issues. To this end, we propose: (1) a RAW-domain VAE
(RVAE) learning optimal latent representations, (2) a differentiable Post Tone
Processing (PTP) module enabling joint RAW and sRGB space optimization. To
compensate for the deficiency in the dataset, we develop a scalable degradation
pipeline synthesizing RAW LQ-HQ pairs from existing sRGB datasets for
large-scale training. Furthermore, we devise a configurable multi-bayer (CMB)
LoRA module handling diverse RAW patterns such as RGGB, BGGR, etc. Extensive
experiments demonstrate RDDM's superiority over state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion
methods, yielding higher fidelity results with fewer artifacts.
