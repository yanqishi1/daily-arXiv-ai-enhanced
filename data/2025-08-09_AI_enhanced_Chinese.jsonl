Traditional methods, such as\nextreme downsampling or transformation from the spatial to the frequency\ndomain, encounter significant drawbacks: downsampling induces irreversible\ninformation loss in UHD images, while our frequency analysis reveals that pure\nfrequency-domain approaches are ineffective for spatially confined image\nartifacts, primarily due to the loss of degradation locality. To overcome these\nlimitations, we present RetinexDual, a novel Retinex theory-based framework\ndesigned for generalized UHD IR tasks. RetinexDual leverages two complementary\nsub-networks: the Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA) and the Frequency Illumination\nAdaptor (FIA). SAMBA, responsible for correcting the reflectance component,\nutilizes a coarse-to-fine mechanism to overcome the causal modeling of mamba,\nwhich effectively reduces artifacts and restores intricate details. On the\nother hand, FIA ensures precise correction of color and illumination\ndistortions by operating in the frequency domain and leveraging the global\ncontext provided by it. Evaluating RetinexDual on four UHD IR tasks, namely\nderaining, deblurring, dehazing, and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE), shows\nthat it outperforms recent methods qualitatively and quantitatively.

Submitted to an IEEE conference", "summary": "Generative models have demonstrated significant success in anomaly detection\nand segmentation over the past decade. Recently, diffusion models have emerged\nas a powerful alternative, outperforming previous approaches such as GANs and\nVAEs. In typical diffusion-based anomaly detection, a model is trained on\nnormal data, and during inference, anomalous images are perturbed to a\npredefined intermediate step in the forward diffusion process. The\ncorresponding normal image is then reconstructed through iterative reverse\nsampling.\n  However, reconstruction-based approaches present three major challenges: (1)\nthe reconstruction process is computationally expensive due to multiple\nsampling steps, making real-time applications impractical; (2) for complex or\nsubtle patterns, the reconstructed image may correspond to a different normal\npattern rather than the original input; and (3) Choosing an appropriate\nintermediate noise level is challenging because it is application-dependent and\noften assumes prior knowledge of anomalies, an assumption that does not hold in\nunsupervised settings.\n  We introduce Reconstruction-free Anomaly Detection with Attention-based\ndiffusion models in Real-time (RADAR), which overcomes the limitations of\nreconstruction-based anomaly detection. Unlike current SOTA methods that\nreconstruct the input image, RADAR directly produces anomaly maps from the\ndiffusion model, improving both detection accuracy and computational\nefficiency. We evaluate RADAR on real-world 3D-printed material and the\nMVTec-AD dataset. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and\nstatistical machine learning models across all key metrics, including accuracy,\nprecision, recall, and F1 score. Specifically, RADAR improves F1 score by 7% on\nMVTec-AD and 13% on the 3D-printed material dataset compared to the next best\nmodel.\n  Code available at: https://github.com/mehrdadmoradi124/RADAR", "AI": {"tldr": "RADAR\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u65e0\u91cd\u5efa\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u91cd\u5efa\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u53ca\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u9009\u62e9\u56f0\u96be\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "RADAR\u76f4\u63a5\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5f02\u5e38\u56fe\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u91cd\u5efa\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728MVTec-AD\u548c3D\u6253\u5370\u6750\u6599\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cRADAR\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u53477%\u548c13%\u3002", "conclusion": "RADAR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Current benchmarks primarily fall into two main\ntypes: basic perception benchmarks, which focus on local details but lack deep\nreasoning (e.g., \"what is in the image?\"), and mainstream reasoning benchmarks,\nwhich concentrate on prominent image elements but may fail to assess subtle\nclues requiring intricate analysis. However, profound visual understanding and\ncomplex reasoning depend more on interpreting subtle, inconspicuous local\ndetails than on perceiving salient, macro-level objects. These details, though\noccupying minimal image area, often contain richer, more critical information\nfor robust analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce the VER-Bench, a novel\nframework to evaluate MLLMs' ability to: 1) identify fine-grained visual clues,\noften occupying on average just 0.25% of the image area; 2) integrate these\nclues with world knowledge for complex reasoning.

We validate our approach\nalong multiple linguistic dimensions, showing that hedged responses receive\n25.6% lower ratings on average, and demonstrate the benchmark's effectiveness\nin identifying model-specific biases.

Weakly\nSupervised DSGG (WS-DSGG) reduces annotation workload by using an unlocalized\nscene graph from a single frame per video for training. Existing WS-DSGG\nmethods depend on an off-the-shelf external object detector to generate pseudo\nlabels for subsequent DSGG training. However, detectors trained on static,\nobject-centric images struggle in dynamic, relation-aware scenarios required\nfor DSGG, leading to inaccurate localization and low-confidence proposals. To\naddress the challenges posed by external object detectors in WS-DSGG, we\npropose a Temporal-enhanced Relation-aware Knowledge Transferring (TRKT)\nmethod, which leverages knowledge to enhance detection in relation-aware\ndynamic scenarios. TRKT is built on two key components:(1)Relation-aware\nknowledge mining: we first employ object and relation class decoders that\ngenerate category-specific attention maps to highlight both object regions and\ninteractive areas. Then we propose an Inter-frame Attention Augmentation\nstrategy that exploits optical flow for neighboring frames to enhance the\nattention maps, making them motion-aware and robust to motion blur. This step\nyields relation- and motion-aware knowledge mining for WS-DSGG.

However,\nexisting methods rely on resource-intensive offline incremental learning or\ndensely annotated support data, limiting their practicality. To address these\nlimitations, we propose HOW-Seg, the first human-in-the-loop framework for\nOW-Seg. Specifically, we construct class prototypes, the fundamental\nsegmentation units, directly on the query data, avoiding the prototype bias\ncaused by intra-class distribution shifts between the support and query data.\nBy leveraging sparse human annotations as guidance, HOW-Seg enables\nprototype-based segmentation for both base and novel classes. Considering the\nlack of granularity of initial prototypes, we introduce a hierarchical\nprototype disambiguation mechanism to refine ambiguous prototypes, which\ncorrespond to annotations of different classes. To further enrich contextual\nawareness, we employ a dense conditional random field (CRF) upon the refined\nprototypes to optimize their label assignments.

This phenomenon has been attributed primarily to\nlocal recurrent interactions, rather than changes in feedforward or feedback\npathways, supported by both empirical findings and circuit-level modeling.\nRecurrent neural circuits capable of simulating these effects have been shown\nto reshape the geometry of neural manifolds, enhancing robustness and\ninvariance to irrelevant variations. In this study, we employ a Vision\nTransformer (ViT)-based autoencoder to investigate, from a functional\nperspective, how familiarity training can induce sensitivity to global context\nin the early layers of a deep neural network. We hypothesize that rapid\nlearning operates via fast weights, which encode transient or short-term memory\ntraces, and we explore the use of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to implement such\nfast weights within each Transformer layer. Our results show that (1) The\nproposed ViT-based autoencoder's self-attention circuit performs a manifold\ntransform similar to a neural circuit model of the familiarity effect. (2)\nFamiliarity training aligns latent representations in early layers with those\nin the top layer that contains global context information. (3) Familiarity\ntraining broadens the self-attention scope within the remembered image context.\n(4) These effects are significantly amplified by LoRA-based fast weights.\nTogether, these findings suggest that familiarity training introduces global\nsensitivity to earlier layers in a hierarchical network, and that a hybrid\nfast-and-slow weight architecture may provide a viable computational model for\nstudying rapid global context learning in the brain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528ViT\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u63a2\u7d22\u5feb\u901f\u5b66\u4e60\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5feb\u901f\u6743\u91cd\uff08\u5982LoRA\uff09\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5c42\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u65e9\u671f\u89c6\u89c9\u76ae\u5c42\u5982\u4f55\u5feb\u901f\u5b66\u4e60\u5168\u5c40\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5feb\u901f\u6743\u91cd\uff08\u5982LoRA\uff09\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528ViT\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548cLoRA\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u6743\u91cd\u5bf9\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "ViT\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u56de\u8def\u7684\u6d41\u5f62\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u4e0e\u9876\u5c42\u8868\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0cLoRA\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5feb\u901f\u6743\u91cd\u67b6\u6784\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u8111\u5feb\u901f\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Extensive experiments demonstrate that MCDRL consistently\noutperforms competing methods, yielding superior segmentation accuracy and\nexhibiting robust generalizability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMCDRL\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u9ad8\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982CLIP\uff09\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7\u8bbe\u5907\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4f2a\u5f71\u548c\u6210\u50cf\u6a21\u5f0f\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "MCDRL\u5206\u4e24\u6b65\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09\u5229\u7528CLIP\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u80fd\u529b\u8bc6\u522b\u5019\u9009\u75c5\u53d8\u533a\u57df\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u6df7\u6dc6\u5b57\u5178\uff1b2\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u7f51\u7edc\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u53d8\u5f02\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eMCDRL\u5728\u5206\u5272\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "MCDRL\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4e0eVLM\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u7684\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, existing\nvideo-based ReID methods often overlook the necessity of identifying and\nselecting the most discriminative features from both videos in a query-gallery\npair for effective matching. To address this issue, we propose a novel\nHierarchical and Adaptive Mixture of Biometric Experts (HAMoBE) framework,\nwhich leverages multi-layer features from a pre-trained large model (e.g.,\nCLIP) and is designed to mimic human perceptual mechanisms by independently\nmodeling key biometric features--appearance, static body shape, and dynamic\ngait--and adaptively integrating them.

Rather than directly probing LLMs with human-crafted\nquestions that may trigger guardrails, we propose studying how models behave\nwhen they proactively ask questions themselves. The 20 Questions game, a\nmulti-turn deduction task, serves as an ideal testbed for this purpose. We\nsystematically evaluate geographic performance disparities in entity deduction\nusing a new dataset, Geo20Q+, consisting of both notable people and culturally\nsignificant objects (e.g., foods, landmarks, animals) from diverse regions. We\ntest popular LLMs across two gameplay configurations (canonical 20-question and\nunlimited turns) and in seven languages (English, Hindi, Mandarin, Japanese,\nFrench, Spanish, and Turkish). Our results reveal geographic disparities: LLMs\nare substantially more successful at deducing entities from the Global North\nthan the Global South, and the Global West than the Global East. While\nWikipedia pageviews and pre-training corpus frequency correlate mildly with\nperformance, they fail to fully explain these disparities.

To\naddress this, we propose AHDMIL, an Asymmetric Hierarchical Distillation\nMulti-Instance Learning framework that enables fast and accurate classification\nby eliminating irrelevant patches through a two-step training process. AHDMIL\ncomprises two key components: the Dynamic Multi-Instance Network (DMIN), which\noperates on high-resolution WSIs, and the Dual-Branch Lightweight Instance\nPre-screening Network (DB-LIPN), which analyzes corresponding low-resolution\ncounterparts. In the first step, self-distillation (SD), DMIN is trained for\nWSI classification while generating per-instance attention scores to identify\nirrelevant patches. These scores guide the second step, asymmetric distillation\n(AD), where DB-LIPN learns to predict the relevance of each low-resolution\npatch. The relevant patches predicted by DB-LIPN have spatial correspondence\nwith patches in high-resolution WSIs, which are used for fine-tuning and\nefficient inference of DMIN. In addition, we design the first\nChebyshev-polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold (CKA) classifier in computational\npathology, which improves classification performance through learnable\nactivation layers. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate\nthat AHDMIL consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both\nclassification performance and inference speed.

We present OmniEAR, a\ncomprehensive framework for evaluating how language models reason about\nphysical interactions, tool usage, and multi-agent coordination in embodied\ntasks. Unlike existing benchmarks that provide predefined tool sets or explicit\ncollaboration directives, OmniEAR requires agents to dynamically acquire\ncapabilities and autonomously determine coordination strategies based on task\ndemands. Through text-based environment representation, we model continuous\nphysical properties and complex spatial relationships across 1,500 scenarios\nspanning household and industrial domains. Our systematic evaluation reveals\nsevere performance degradation when models must reason from constraints: while\nachieving 85-96% success with explicit instructions, performance drops to\n56-85% for tool reasoning and 63-85% for implicit collaboration, with compound\ntasks showing over 50% failure rates. Surprisingly, complete environmental\ninformation degrades coordination performance, indicating models cannot filter\ntask-relevant constraints.

This task is realized by representing the\nimage as a continuous implicit function through two fundamental modules, a\ndeep-network-based encoder and an implicit neural representation (INR) module.\nDespite achieving notable progress, a crucial challenge of such a highly\nill-posed setting is that many common geometric patterns, such as repetitive\ntextures, edges, or shapes, are seriously warped and deformed in the\nlow-resolution images, naturally leading to unexpected artifacts appearing in\ntheir high-resolution recoveries. Embedding rotation equivariance into the\nASISR network is thus necessary, as it has been widely demonstrated that this\nenhancement enables the recovery to faithfully maintain the original\norientations and structural integrity of geometric patterns underlying the\ninput image. Motivated by this, we make efforts to construct a rotation\nequivariant ASISR method in this study. Specifically, we elaborately redesign\nthe basic architectures of INR and encoder modules, incorporating intrinsic\nrotation equivariance capabilities beyond those of conventional ASISR networks.\nThrough such amelioration, the ASISR network can, for the first time, be\nimplemented with end-to-end rotational equivariance maintained from input to\noutput. We also provide a solid theoretical analysis to evaluate its intrinsic\nequivariance error, demonstrating its inherent nature of embedding such an\nequivariance structure. The superiority of the proposed method is substantiated\nby experiments conducted on both simulated and real datasets.

However, extending CoT to vision-language reasoning tasks remains\nchallenging, as it often requires interpreting transitions of visual states to\nsupport reasoning. Existing methods often struggle with this due to limited\ncapacity of modeling visual state transitions or incoherent visual trajectories\ncaused by fragmented architectures.\n  To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-CoT, a Unified Chain-of-Thought\nframework that enables coherent and grounded multimodal reasoning within a\nsingle unified model. The key idea is to leverage a model capable of both image\nunderstanding and generation to reason over visual content and model evolving\nvisual states. However, empowering a unified model to achieve that is\nnon-trivial, given the high computational cost and the burden of training. To\naddress this, Uni-CoT introduces a novel two-level reasoning paradigm: A\nMacro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and A Micro-Level CoT for subtask\nexecution. This design significantly reduces the computational overhead.\nFurthermore, we introduce a structured training paradigm that combines\ninterleaved image-text supervision for macro-level CoT with multi-task\nobjectives for micro-level CoT. Together, these innovations allow Uni-CoT to\nperform scalable and coherent multi-modal reasoning. Furthermore, thanks to our\ndesign, all experiments can be efficiently completed using only 8 A100 GPUs\nwith 80GB VRAM each. Experimental results on reasoning-driven image generation\nbenchmark (WISE) and editing benchmarks (RISE and KRIS) indicates that Uni-CoT\ndemonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalization, establishing Uni-CoT\nas a promising solution for multi-modal reasoning.

Yet, it remains a challenge due to difficult visual\nconditions (e.g., weak textures, large viewpoint variations) and a scarcity of\nannotated data. To address these challenges, we propose EndoMatcher, a\ngeneralizable endoscopic image matcher via large-scale, multi-domain data\npre-training. To address difficult visual conditions, EndoMatcher employs a\ntwo-branch Vision Transformer to extract multi-scale features, enhanced by dual\ninteraction blocks for robust correspondence learning. To overcome data\nscarcity and improve domain diversity, we construct Endo-Mix6, the first\nmulti-domain dataset for endoscopic matching. Endo-Mix6 consists of\napproximately 1.2M real and synthetic image pairs across six domains, with\ncorrespondence labels generated using Structure-from-Motion and simulated\ntransformations. The diversity and scale of Endo-Mix6 introduce new challenges\nin training stability due to significant variations in dataset sizes,\ndistribution shifts, and error imbalance. To address them, a progressive\nmulti-objective training strategy is employed to promote balanced learning and\nimprove representation quality across domains.

To address these issues, this paper proposes\nSGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by the Segment Anything Model\n(SAM), to achieve high-fidelity and semantically-aware image fusion. The core\nof our method is to utilize high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as\nexplicit priors to guide the optimization of the fusion process via a\nconditional diffusion model. Specifically, the framework operates in a\ntwo-stage process: it first performs a preliminary fusion of multi-modal\nfeatures, and then utilizes the semantic masks from SAM jointly with the\npreliminary fused image as a condition to drive the diffusion model's\ncoarse-to-fine denoising generation. This ensures the fusion process not only\nhas explicit semantic directionality but also guarantees the high fidelity of\nthe final result.

Despite the remarkable progress of\ndeep learning in recent years, most existing methods still rely on\nspatial-domain modeling, where the limited diversity of feature representations\nhinders the detection of subtle change regions. We observe that\nfrequency-domain feature modeling particularly in the wavelet domain an amplify\nfine-grained differences in frequency components, enhancing the perception of\nedge changes that are challenging to capture in the spatial domain. Thus, we\npropose a method called Wavelet-Guided Dual-Frequency Encoding (WGDF).\nSpecifically, we first apply Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to decompose the\ninput images into high-frequency and low-frequency components, which are used\nto model local details and global structures, respectively. In the\nhigh-frequency branch, we design a Dual-Frequency Feature Enhancement (DFFE)\nmodule to strengthen edge detail representation and introduce a\nFrequency-Domain Interactive Difference (FDID) module to enhance the modeling\nof fine-grained changes. In the low-frequency branch, we exploit Transformers\nto capture global semantic relationships and employ a Progressive Contextual\nDifference Module (PCDM) to progressively refine change regions, enabling\nprecise structural semantic characterization. Finally, the high- and\nlow-frequency features are synergistically fused to unify local sensitivity\nwith global discriminability. Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing\ndatasets demonstrate that WGDF significantly alleviates edge ambiguity and\nachieves superior detection accuracy and robustness compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods.

Specifically, through sketches with the theme of \"a person picking an\napple from a tree (PPAT)\", it can be revealed whether the participants are in\nmental states such as depression.

To address this issue, we propose an effective identification\nmethod to support psychologists in conducting a large-scale automatic DPT.\nUnlike traditional sketch recognition, DPT more focus on the overall evaluation\nof the sketches, such as color usage and space utilization. Moreover, PPAT\nimposes a time limit and prohibits verbal reminders, resulting in low drawing\naccuracy and a lack of detailed depiction. To address these challenges, we\npropose the following efforts: (1) Providing an experimental environment for\nautomated analysis of PPAT sketches for depression assessment; (2) Offering a\nVisual-Semantic depression assessment based on LLM (VS-LLM) method; (3)\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method improves by 17.6% compared to\nthe psychologist assessment method.

While the initial VLM\nweights allow for great few-shot transfer learning, this usually involves the\nloss of the original natural language querying and zero-shot capabilities.\nInspired by the success of Textual Inversion (TI) in personalizing\ntext-to-image diffusion models, we propose a similar formulation for\nopen-vocabulary object detection. TI allows extending the VLM vocabulary by\nlearning new or improving existing tokens to accurately detect novel or\nfine-grained objects from as little as three examples.

Traditional tracking methods, which typically rely on\nfull-body bounding box features extracted from {Re-ID} models and linear\nconstant-velocity motion assumptions, often struggle in severe occlusion\nscenarios. To address these limitations, this work proposes an enhanced\ntracking framework that leverages richer feature representations and a more\nrobust motion model. Specifically, the proposed method incorporates detection\nfeatures from both the regression and classification branches of an object\ndetector, embedding spatial and positional information directly into the\nfeature representations. To further mitigate occlusion challenges, a head\nkeypoint detection model is introduced, as the head is less prone to occlusion\ncompared to the full body. In terms of motion modeling, we propose an iterative\nKalman filtering approach designed to align with modern detector assumptions,\nintegrating 3D priors to better complete motion trajectories in complex scenes.\nBy combining these advancements in appearance and motion modeling, the proposed\nmethod offers a more robust solution for multi-object tracking in crowded\nenvironments where occlusions are prevalent.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u884c\u4eba\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u906e\u6321\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u884c\u4eba\u906e\u6321\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5168\u8eab\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u8fd0\u52a8\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u5206\u652f\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5934\u90e8\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8fed\u4ee3\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u548c3D\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u906e\u6321\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u62e5\u6324\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u89c2\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u906e\u6321\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Existing methods mainly rely on\nimage-based metrics and operate solely at the object level, limiting their\nability to capture spatial coherence, material authenticity, and high-fidelity\nlocal details. 1) To address these challenges, we introduce Hi3DEval, a\nhierarchical evaluation framework tailored for 3D generative content. It\ncombines both object-level and part-level evaluation, enabling holistic\nassessments across multiple dimensions as well as fine-grained quality\nanalysis. Additionally, we extend texture evaluation beyond aesthetic\nappearance by explicitly assessing material realism, focusing on attributes\nsuch as albedo, saturation, and metallicness. 2) To support this framework, we\nconstruct Hi3DBench, a large-scale dataset comprising diverse 3D assets and\nhigh-quality annotations, accompanied by a reliable multi-agent annotation\npipeline. We further propose a 3D-aware automated scoring system based on\nhybrid 3D representations.

Although state-of-the-art methods have achieved impressive\nperformance (e.g., 90+% J&F) on existing benchmarks such as DAVIS and\nYouTube-VOS, these datasets primarily contain salient, dominant, and isolated\nobjects, limiting their generalization to real-world scenarios. To advance VOS\ntoward more realistic environments, coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSEv1)\nwas introduced to facilitate VOS research in complex scenes. Building on the\nstrengths and limitations of MOSEv1, we present MOSEv2, a significantly more\nchallenging dataset designed to further advance VOS methods under real-world\nconditions. MOSEv2 consists of 5,024 videos and over 701,976 high-quality masks\nfor 10,074 objects across 200 categories. Compared to its predecessor, MOSEv2\nintroduces significantly greater scene complexity, including more frequent\nobject disappearance and reappearance, severe occlusions and crowding, smaller\nobjects, as well as a range of new challenges such as adverse weather (e.g.,\nrain, snow, fog), low-light scenes (e.g., nighttime, underwater), multi-shot\nsequences, camouflaged objects, non-physical targets (e.g., shadows,\nreflections), scenarios requiring external knowledge, etc. We benchmark 20\nrepresentative VOS methods under 5 different settings and observe consistent\nperformance drops.

As point clouds serve as a widely-used and\neasily accessible form of 3D representation, bridging the gap between point\nclouds and Gaussians becomes increasingly important. Recent studies have\nexplored how to convert the colored points into Gaussians, but directly\ngenerating Gaussians from colorless 3D point clouds remains an unsolved\nchallenge. In this paper, we propose GAP, a novel approach that gaussianizes\nraw point clouds into high-fidelity 3D Gaussians with text guidance. Our key\nidea is to design a multi-view optimization framework that leverages a\ndepth-aware image diffusion model to synthesize consistent appearances across\ndifferent viewpoints. To ensure geometric accuracy, we introduce a\nsurface-anchoring mechanism that effectively constrains Gaussians to lie on the\nsurfaces of 3D shapes during optimization. Furthermore, GAP incorporates a\ndiffuse-based inpainting strategy that specifically targets at completing\nhard-to-observe regions.

Existing face anonymization methods typically focus on\nobscuring identity but fail to meet the requirements of biometric template\nprotection, including revocability, unlinkability, and irreversibility. We\npropose FaceAnonyMixer, a cancelable face generation framework that leverages\nthe latent space of a pre-trained generative model to synthesize\nprivacy-preserving face images. The core idea of FaceAnonyMixer is to\nirreversibly mix the latent code of a real face image with a synthetic code\nderived from a revocable key. The mixed latent code is further refined through\na carefully designed multi-objective loss to satisfy all cancelable biometric\nrequirements. FaceAnonyMixer is capable of generating high-quality cancelable\nfaces that can be directly matched using existing FR systems without requiring\nany modifications. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that\nFaceAnonyMixer delivers superior recognition accuracy while providing\nsignificantly stronger privacy protection, achieving over an 11% gain on\ncommercial API compared to recent cancelable biometric methods.
