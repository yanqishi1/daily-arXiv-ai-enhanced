### [1] [Fair Play in the Newsroom: Actor-Based Filtering Gender Discrimination in Text Corpora](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13169)
*Stefanie Urchs,Veronika Thurner,Matthias Aßenmacher,Christian Heumann,Stephanie Thiemichen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种扩展的动词级流水线，用于检测和缓解大规模文本语料库中的性别偏见问题，并在德国报纸语料库中验证了其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型输出常反映训练数据中的结构性性别不平衡问题，需要开发更有效的检测和缓解方法来构建更公平的语料库。

Method: 基于话语感知公平性分析的前期工作，提出了新的动词级指标来捕捉情感、句法主动性和引用风格的不对称性，支持诊断性语料分析和排除基于的平衡化。

Result: 在taz2024full德国报纸文章语料库(1980-2024)中应用该方法，在多个语言维度上显示出性别平衡的显著改善，但情感和框架方面的隐蕴偏见仍持续存在。

Conclusion: 表面层面的不对称性可通过过滤和重新平衡来缓解，但需要更多研究来应对更细微的偏见形式，并为话语基于公平性审计和公平语料库构建提供工具支持。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly shaping digital communication, yet
their outputs often reflect structural gender imbalances that originate from
their training data. This paper presents an extended actor-level pipeline for
detecting and mitigating gender discrimination in large-scale text corpora.
Building on prior work in discourse-aware fairness analysis, we introduce new
actor-level metrics that capture asymmetries in sentiment, syntactic agency,
and quotation styles. The pipeline supports both diagnostic corpus analysis and
exclusion-based balancing, enabling the construction of fairer corpora. We
apply our approach to the taz2024full corpus of German newspaper articles from
1980 to 2024, demonstrating substantial improvements in gender balance across
multiple linguistic dimensions. Our results show that while surface-level
asymmetries can be mitigated through filtering and rebalancing, subtler forms
of bias persist, particularly in sentiment and framing. We release the tools
and reports to support further research in discourse-based fairness auditing
and equitable corpus construction.

### [2] [MM-BrowseComp: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Multimodal Browsing Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13186)
*Shilong Li,Xingyuan Bu,Wenjie Wang,Jiaheng Liu,Jun Dong,Haoyang He,Hao Lu,Haozhe Zhang,Chenchen Jing,Zhen Li,Chuanhao Li,Jiayi Tian,Chenchen Zhang,Tianhao Peng,Yancheng He,Jihao Gu,Yuanxing Zhang,Jian Yang,Ge Zhang,Wenhao Huang,Wangchunshu Zhou,Zhaoxiang Zhang,Ruizhe Ding,Shilei Wen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MM-BrowseComp是一个新的多模态网页浏览基准测试，包含224个手工制作的问题，专门评估AI代理的多模态检索和推理能力，现有最先进模型仅达到29.02%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的网页浏览基准测试（如BrowseComp）主要关注文本信息，忽视了网页中普遍存在的多模态内容，需要开发能够评估多模态检索和推理能力的基准。

Method: 创建了包含224个挑战性问题的MM-BrowseComp基准，这些问题在提示中包含图像，且搜索和推理过程中的关键信息可能嵌入在网页的图像或视频中。为每个问题提供验证清单以进行细粒度分析。

Result: 对最先进模型的全面评估显示，即使是OpenAI o3等顶级模型也仅达到29.02%的准确率，表明当前模型的多模态能力和原生多模态推理存在不足。

Conclusion: MM-BrowseComp基准揭示了当前AI代理在多模态网页浏览方面的显著局限性，强调了开发更强大多模态推理能力的必要性。

Abstract: AI agents with advanced reasoning and tool use capabilities have demonstrated
impressive performance in web browsing for deep search. While existing
benchmarks such as BrowseComp evaluate these browsing abilities, they primarily
focus on textual information, overlooking the prevalence of multimodal content.
To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-BrowseComp, a novel benchmark comprising
224 challenging, hand-crafted questions specifically designed to assess agents'
multimodal retrieval and reasoning capabilities. These questions often
incorporate images in prompts, and crucial information encountered during the
search and reasoning process may also be embedded within images or videos on
webpages. Consequently, methods relying solely on text prove insufficient for
our benchmark. Additionally, we provide a verified checklist for each question,
enabling fine-grained analysis of multimodal dependencies and reasoning paths.
Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models on MM-BrowseComp
reveals that even top models like OpenAI o3 with tools achieve only 29.02\%
accuracy, highlighting the suboptimal multimodal capabilities and lack of
native multimodal reasoning in current models.

### [3] [Overcoming Latency Bottlenecks in On-Device Speech Translation: A Cascaded Approach with Alignment-Based Streaming MT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13358)
*Zeeshan Ahmed,Frank Seide,Niko Moritz,Ju Lin,Ruiming Xie,Simone Merello,Zhe Liu,Christian Fuegen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文解决了在设备上实时流式语音翻译中集成自动语音识别(ASR)和机器翻译(MT)的多项挑战，通过同步翻译方法平衡质量与延迟，利用ASR语言线索管理上下文，采用高效检索剪枝技术保持实时性，在双语对话翻译中显著提升了延迟和质量表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然基于RNN-T的ASR系统能够实时转写，但在设备上实现流式实时翻译仍面临重大挑战，需要找到翻译质量与延迟之间的有效平衡。

Method: 提出同步翻译方法，利用ASR系统生成的语言线索来管理上下文，采用高效检索剪枝技术（如超时和强制终止）来维持系统的实时性。

Result: 在设备双语对话语音翻译中应用，技术在延迟和质量方面都超过了基线方法，缩小了与非流式翻译系统的质量差距。

Conclusion: 该方法为更准确和高效的实时语音翻译抓埋了基础，通过有效的ASR-MT集成和优化技术实现了实时流式翻译的可行性。

Abstract: This paper tackles several challenges that arise when integrating Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) and Machine Translation (MT) for real-time, on-device
streaming speech translation. Although state-of-the-art ASR systems based on
Recurrent Neural Network Transducers (RNN-T) can perform real-time
transcription, achieving streaming translation in real-time remains a
significant challenge. To address this issue, we propose a simultaneous
translation approach that effectively balances translation quality and latency.
We also investigate efficient integration of ASR and MT, leveraging linguistic
cues generated by the ASR system to manage context and utilizing efficient
beam-search pruning techniques such as time-out and forced finalization to
maintain system's real-time factor. We apply our approach to an on-device
bilingual conversational speech translation and demonstrate that our techniques
outperform baselines in terms of latency and quality. Notably, our technique
narrows the quality gap with non-streaming translation systems, paving the way
for more accurate and efficient real-time speech translation.

### [4] [Stands to Reason: Investigating the Effect of Reasoning on Idiomaticity Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13365)
*Dylan Phelps,Rodrigo Wilkens,Edward Gow-Smith,Thomas Pickard,Maggie Mi,Aline Villavicencio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型的推理能力对习语检测性能的影响，发现推理效果比预期小且多变，大模型能较好理解习语含义而小模型表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用推理模型提升大型语言模型在逻辑推理任务上的表现，探索推理能力对习语检测这一需要理解语言表达含义的任务的影响。

Method: 评估DeepSeek-R1蒸馏模型系列（1.5B到70B参数）在四个习语检测数据集上的表现，分析推理链（CoT）对性能的影响，并为小模型提供定义提示进行实验。

Result: 推理效果较小且多变：小模型通过CoT推理能从数学调优模型中提升性能但不及基础模型；大模型（14B、32B、70B）有适度提升；大模型能准确生成习语定义，小模型常失败；为小模型提供定义提示能在某些情况下改善性能。

Conclusion: 模型大小对习语理解能力有显著影响，大模型在习语检测任务上表现更好，通过提供外部定义可以部分弥补小模型的不足。

Abstract: The recent trend towards utilisation of reasoning models has improved the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across many tasks which involve
logical steps. One linguistic task that could benefit from this framing is
idiomaticity detection, as a potentially idiomatic expression must first be
understood before it can be disambiguated and serves as a basis for reasoning.
In this paper, we explore how reasoning capabilities in LLMs affect
idiomaticity detection performance and examine the effect of model size. We
evaluate, as open source representative models, the suite of DeepSeek-R1
distillation models ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters across four
idiomaticity detection datasets. We find the effect of reasoning to be smaller
and more varied than expected. For smaller models, producing chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning increases performance from Math-tuned intermediate models, but
not to the levels of the base models, whereas larger models (14B, 32B, and 70B)
show modest improvements. Our in-depth analyses reveal that larger models
demonstrate good understanding of idiomaticity, successfully producing accurate
definitions of expressions, while smaller models often fail to output the
actual meaning. For this reason, we also experiment with providing definitions
in the prompts of smaller models, which we show can improve performance in some
cases.

### [5] [Whispering Context: Distilling Syntax and Semantics for Long Speech Transcripts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13376)
*Duygu Altinok*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过从LLaMA模型获取上下文知识并向Whisper进行知识精炼，提升长音频语音识别的语法和语义准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR系统在长音频转录中常常无法维持语法和语义准确性，影响命名实体识别、大写化和标点符号等任务

Method: 使用两种策略：(1)令牌级利用最优运输进行维度和序列长度对齐的知识精炼；(2)最小化Whisper和LLaMA句子嵌入表示之间的表示损失，混合语法和语义

Result: 在Spoken Wikipedia数据集上评估显示在词错误率(WER)、命名实体识别、大写化和标点符号成功率方面取得显著改进

Conclusion: 通过引入新的NER指标和探索语义感知ASR，本研究强调了将语言上下文集成到转录中的价值，为长形式语音的健壮、上下文感知ASR建立了基础

Abstract: ASR systems often struggle with maintaining syntactic and semantic accuracy
in long audio transcripts, impacting tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER),
capitalization, and punctuation. We propose a novel approach that enhances ASR
by distilling contextual knowledge from LLaMA models into Whisper. Our method
uses two strategies: (1) token level distillation with optimal transport to
align dimensions and sequence lengths, and (2) representation loss minimization
between sentence embeddings of Whisper and LLaMA, blending syntax and
semantics. Evaluations on the Spoken Wikipedia dataset, a benchmark with long
audios and rich entities demonstrate significant improvements in Word Error
Rate (WER), NER, capitalization, and punctuation success. By introducing novel
NER metrics and exploring semantics aware ASR, our work highlights the value of
integrating linguistic context into transcription, setting a foundation for
robust, context-aware ASR in longform speech.

### [6] [Datarus-R1: An Adaptive Multi-Step Reasoning LLM for Automated Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13382)
*Ayoub Ben Chaliah,Hela Dellagi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Datarus-R1-14B是一个14B参数的开源语言模型，基于Qwen 2.5-14B-Instruct微调，专门用于虚拟数据分析和研究生级别问题求解。通过轨迹式训练、双奖励框架和GRPO优化，在多个基准测试中超越同规模模型，甚至达到更大模型的性能水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统LLM在复杂问题求解中存在的格式崩溃、冗长循环和推理不连贯等问题，通过完整的分析轨迹训练来提升模型的分析能力和推理质量。

Method: 1) 轨迹中心合成数据生成器产生14.4万个标记笔记本片段；2) 双奖励框架结合轻量级结构信号和分层奖励模型；3) 内存优化的GRPO实现，包含KV缓存重用和顺序生成；4) 余弦课程从结构保真度平滑过渡到语义深度。

Result: 在标准公开基准测试中超越同规模模型，达到QwQ-32B等更大推理模型的水平，在AIME 2024/2025和LiveCodeBench上准确率提升高达30%，同时每个解决方案减少18-49%的token输出。

Conclusion: Datarus通过轨迹式训练和双推理接口设计，成功实现了高质量的分析推理能力，避免了常见RL对齐LLM的问题，在复杂问题求解中表现出色。

Abstract: We present Datarus-R1-14B, a 14 B-parameter open-weights language model
fine-tuned from Qwen 2.5-14B-Instruct to act as a virtual data analyst and
graduate-level problem solver. Datarus is trained not on isolated
question-answer pairs but on full analytical trajectories including reasoning
steps, code execution, error traces, self-corrections, and final conclusions,
all captured in a ReAct-style notebook format spanning finance, medicine,
numerical analysis, and other quantitative domains. Our training pipeline
combines (i) a trajectory-centric synthetic data generator that yielded 144 000
tagged notebook episodes, (ii) a dual-reward framework blending a lightweight
tag-based structural signal with a Hierarchical Reward Model (HRM) that scores
both single-step soundness and end-to-end coherence, and (iii) a
memory-optimized implementation of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
featuring KV-cache reuse, sequential generation, and reference-model sharding.
A cosine curriculum smoothly shifts emphasis from structural fidelity to
semantic depth, reducing the format collapse and verbosity that often plague
RL-aligned LLMs. A central design choice in Datarus is it dual reasoning
interface. In agentic mode the model produces ReAct-tagged steps that invoke
Python tools to execute real code; in reflection mode it outputs compact
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces delimited by <think> and <answer> tags. On
demanding postgraduate-level problems, Datarus exhibits an "AHA-moment"
pattern: it sketches hypotheses, revises them once or twice, and converges
avoiding the circular, token-inflating loops common to contemporary systems.
Across standard public benchmarks Datarus surpasses similar size models and
even reaches the level of larger reasoning models such as QwQ-32B achieving up
to 30% higher accuracy on AIME 2024/2025 and LiveCodeBench while emitting
18-49% fewer tokens per solution.

### [7] [ALIGN: Word Association Learning for Cross-Cultural Generalization in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13426)
*Chunhua Liu,Kabir Manandhar Shrestha,Sukai Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过参数效率微调以本语者词语联想规范培养大语言模型的文化对齐能力，在保持语言性能的同时显著提升文化倾向性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在跨文化交流中存在的分布偏差问题，因为预训练语料库中某些语言和观点过度代表，导致文化对齐挑战

Method: 采用参数效率微调技术，使用Small-World-of-Words项目的英语-美国和普通话词语联想规范进行监督式微调和PPO基于偏好优化，这些规范编码了隐式的文化模式

Result: 微调后模型在词语联想预测精度提升16-20%（英语）和43-165%（普通话），具体性提升+0.20，情绪价值达到人类水平。在世界价值观调查中答案分布向目标文化偏移，在高张力问题上中国对齐回复增加一倍，美国偏见减少33%。7-8B模型性能超过原生70B基线模型

Conclusion: 几百万个基于文化的词语联想能够在不需昂贵重新训练的情况下实现价值对齐，强调了基于人类认知的研究在改善AI模型文化对齐中的重要性和潜力

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate cross-cultural
communication, their behavior still reflects the distributional bias of the
languages and viewpoints that are over-represented in their pre-training
corpora. Yet, it remains a challenge to model and align culture due to limited
cultural knowledge and a lack of exploration into effective learning
approaches. We introduce a cost-efficient, cognitively grounded remedy:
parameter-efficient fine-tuning on native speakers' free word-association
norms, which encode implicit cultural schemas. Leveraging English-US and
Mandarin associations from the Small-World-of-Words project, we adapt
Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and PPO-based
preference optimization. SFT boosts held-out association Precision at 5 by
16-20% in English and 43-165% in Mandarin, lifts median concreteness by +0.20,
and attains human-level valence and arousal. These lexical gains transfer: on
World-Values-Survey questions, fine-tuned models shift answer distributions
toward the target culture, and on a 50-item high-tension subset, Qwen's
Chinese-aligned responses double while Llama's US bias drops by one-third. Our
7-8B models rival or beat vanilla 70B baselines, showing that a few million
culture-grounded associations can instill value alignment without costly
retraining. Our work highlights both the promise and the need for future
research grounded in human cognition in improving cultural alignment in AI
models.

### [8] [ProMed: Shapley Information Gain Guided Reinforcement Learning for Proactive Medical LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13514)
*Hongxin Ding,Baixiang Huang,Yue Fang,Weibin Liao,Xinke Jiang,Zheng Li,Junfeng Zhao,Yasha Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProMed是一个强化学习框架，通过Shapley信息增益奖励机制，使医疗大语言模型从被动回答转向主动提问的交互范式，显著提升医疗诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗大语言模型主要采用被动回答模式，缺乏主动信息收集能力，在真实临床交互场景中存在误诊风险。需要让模型具备主动提问能力来改善诊断准确性。

Method: 提出ProMed强化学习框架：1）使用Shapley信息增益(SIG)奖励量化问题的临床价值；2）两阶段训练流程：SIG引导的模型初始化和SIG增强的策略优化，包括新颖的SIG引导奖励分配机制。

Result: 在两个新构建的部分信息医疗基准测试中，ProMed平均优于最先进方法6.29%，相比被动范式提升54.45%，并在域外案例中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: ProMed成功将医疗LLM转变为主动交互范式，通过强化学习和信息理论奖励机制显著提升了模型在临床交互场景中的诊断性能和实用性。

Abstract: Interactive medical questioning is essential in real-world clinical
consultations, where physicians must actively gather information from patients.
While medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
in static medical question answering, they predominantly operate under a
reactive paradigm: generating answers directly without seeking additional
information, which risks incorrect diagnoses in such interactive settings. To
address this limitation, we propose ProMed, a reinforcement learning (RL)
framework that transitions medical LLMs toward a proactive paradigm, equipping
them with the ability to ask clinically valuable questions before
decision-making. At the core of ProMed is the Shapley Information Gain (SIG)
reward, which quantifies the clinical utility of each question by combining the
amount of newly acquired information with its contextual importance, estimated
via Shapley values. We integrate SIG into a two-stage training pipeline: (1)
SIG-Guided Model Initialization uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to
construct high-reward interaction trajectories to supervise the model, and (2)
SIG-Augmented Policy Optimization, which integrates SIG and enhances RL with a
novel SIG-guided Reward Distribution Mechanism that assigns higher rewards to
informative questions for targeted optimization. Extensive experiments on two
newly curated partial-information medical benchmarks demonstrate that ProMed
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.29% and
delivers a 54.45% gain over the reactive paradigm, while also generalizing
robustly to out-of-domain cases.

### [9] [Saudi-Dialect-ALLaM: LoRA Fine-Tuning for Dialectal Arabic Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13525)
*Hassan Barmandah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过LoRA微调ALLAM-7B模型，使其能够生成沙特阿拉伯方言（赛德和氪吉敦），提升了方言生成的控制能力和文本保真度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有阿拉伯语言模型主要支持现代标准阿拉伯语(MSA)，对沙特方言支持有限，影响了对真实方言变体的捐捕能力

Method: 使用私有沙特方言指令数据集（5,466条合成指令-响应对），采用LoRA微调技术训练ALLAM-7B模型，测试了两种方案：带方言标签和不带标签的训练方式

Result: 带方言标签的模型表现最佳，将沙特方言生成率从47.97%提升到84.21%，MSA泄漏率从32.63%降至6.21%，文本保真度也有显著提升

Conclusion: LoRA微调技术能够有效地让基础模型支持沙特方言生成，在方言控制和文本质量方面都超过了其他通用指令模型，为不同方言的语言模型开发提供了有效方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for Arabic are still dominated by Modern
Standard Arabic (MSA), with limited support for Saudi dialects such as Najdi
and Hijazi. This underrepresentation hinders their ability to capture authentic
dialectal variation. Using a privately curated Saudi Dialect Instruction
dataset (Hijazi and Najdi; 5,466 synthetic instruction-response pairs; 50/50
split), we LoRA-tune ALLaM-7B-Instruct-preview, the first foundation model
developed in Saudi Arabia, for Saudi dialect generation. We investigate two
variants: (i) Dialect-Token training, which prepends an explicit dialect tag to
the instruction, and (ii) No-Token training, which omits the tag at formatting
time. Evaluation on a held-out test set combines an external dialect classifier
with text fidelity metrics (chrF++ and BERTScore) and diversity measures. The
Dialect-Token model achieves the best control, raising the Saudi rate from
47.97% to 84.21% and reducing MSA leakage from 32.63% to 6.21%; fidelity also
improves (chrF++ +3.53, BERTScore +0.059). Both LoRA variants outperform strong
generic instruction models (Falcon-7B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct,
Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct, AceGPT-v2-8B-Chat, JAIS-13B-Chat) in dialect control and
fidelity, while avoiding metadata-tag echoing that these baselines frequently
exhibit. We do not release the dataset or any model weights/adapters; instead,
we release training/evaluation/inference code and a detailed datasheet (schema
and aggregate statistics) to support independent verification.

### [10] [MATA (māta): Mindful Assessment of the Telugu Abilities of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13526)
*Chalamalasetti Kranti,Sowmya Vajjala*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MATA是一个新的泰卢固语评估数据集，包含729个多项选择和开放式问题，用于评估大语言模型在泰卢固语中的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型在低资源语言泰卢固语中的表现，理解模型局限性，为开发更具语言能力的大语言模型提供信息。

Method: 创建包含729个多项选择和开放式问题的数据集，评估11个开源和闭源大语言模型，分析模型性能，研究模型对表面启发式的依赖，比较LLM作为评判者与人类评估的可靠性。

Result: 发现大语言模型依赖答案位置和干扰项模式等表面启发式方法进行多项选择题，在低资源语言中LLM作为评判者的可靠性需要进一步研究。

Conclusion: 细粒度评估对于理解模型局限性至关重要，可以为开发更具语言能力的大语言模型提供信息，同时为未来泰卢固语NLP研究奠定基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MATA, a novel evaluation dataset to assess the
ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Telugu language, comprising 729
carefully curated multiple-choice and open-ended questions that span diverse
linguistic dimensions. We evaluate 11 open-weight and closed-source LLMs on our
dataset and present a fine-grained analysis of their performance. Further, we
empirically show how LLMs rely on superficial heuristics such as answer
position and distractor patterns for multiple-choice questions. Finally, we
also compare LLM-as-a-judge evaluation with human evaluation for open-ended
questions and draw some conclusions on its reliability in a low-resource
language. We argue that such fine-grained evaluation is essential for
understanding model limitations and can inform the development of more
linguistically capable LLMs, while also serving as a foundation for future
research in Telugu NLP.

### [11] [Compressed Models are NOT Trust-equivalent to Their Large Counterparts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13533)
*Rohit Raj Rai,Chirag Kothari,Siddhesh Shelke,Amit Awekar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 模型压缩后虽然性能差异小，但在可解释性和检验准确性方面与原始大模型存在显著差异，不能直接作为可信赖的替代品


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注压缩对模型准确率的影响，但性能平等并不保证可信赖性相等，需要从更深层次评估压缩模型的可信赖程度

Method: 提出二维度可信赖性评估框架：1)可解释性对齐（使用LIME和SHAP测试）；2)检验准确性相似性（通过ECE、MCE、Brier Score和可靠性图评估）。以BERT-base模型及其压缩版本在自然语言推理和句子重写识别任务上进行实验

Result: 即使准确率几乎相同，压缩模型与原始大模型在可解释性对齐和检验准确性方面存在显著差异，可解释性对齐度低且检验准确性不相似

Conclusion: 压缩模型并非原始大模型的可信赖替代品，在部署时需要进行谨慎评估，不能仅以性能指标作为唯一判断标准

Abstract: Large Deep Learning models are often compressed before being deployed in a
resource-constrained environment. Can we trust the prediction of compressed
models just as we trust the prediction of the original large model? Existing
work has keenly studied the effect of compression on accuracy and related
performance measures. However, performance parity does not guarantee
trust-equivalence. We propose a two-dimensional framework for trust-equivalence
evaluation. First, interpretability alignment measures whether the models base
their predictions on the same input features. We use LIME and SHAP tests to
measure the interpretability alignment. Second, calibration similarity measures
whether the models exhibit comparable reliability in their predicted
probabilities. It is assessed via ECE, MCE, Brier Score, and reliability
diagrams. We conducted experiments using BERT-base as the large model and its
multiple compressed variants. We focused on two text classification tasks:
natural language inference and paraphrase identification. Our results reveal
low interpretability alignment and significant mismatch in calibration
similarity. It happens even when the accuracies are nearly identical between
models. These findings show that compressed models are not trust-equivalent to
their large counterparts. Deploying compressed models as a drop-in replacement
for large models requires careful assessment, going beyond performance parity.

### [12] [A Comparative Study of Decoding Strategies in Medical Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13580)
*Oriana Presacan,Alireza Nik,Vajira Thambawita,Bogdan Ionescu,Michael Riegler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 医疗领域LLM解码策略研究：确定性方法优于随机方法，beam search表现最佳，医疗专用模型在部分任务中表现更好但对解码策略更敏感


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗领域准确性至关重要的背景下，解码策略对LLM输出质量的影响尚未得到充分研究，需要系统评估不同解码策略在医疗任务中的表现

Method: 在五个开放式医疗任务（翻译、摘要、问答、对话、图像描述）中评估11种解码策略，使用医疗专用和通用LLM不同尺寸模型，比较多种评估指标

Result: 确定性策略普遍优于随机策略，beam search得分最高；较慢的解码方法质量更好；大模型总体得分更高但推理时间更长；医疗LLM在两个任务中表现更好但对解码策略更敏感；不同评估指标相关性因任务而异

Conclusion: 解码策略的选择在医疗应用中至关重要，其影响有时甚至超过模型选择本身，需要谨慎选择解码方法

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on various decoding strategies to generate
text, and these choices can significantly affect output quality. In healthcare,
where accuracy is critical, the impact of decoding strategies remains
underexplored. We investigate this effect in five open-ended medical tasks,
including translation, summarization, question answering, dialogue, and image
captioning, evaluating 11 decoding strategies with medically specialized and
general-purpose LLMs of different sizes. Our results show that deterministic
strategies generally outperform stochastic ones: beam search achieves the
highest scores, while {\eta} and top-k sampling perform worst. Slower decoding
methods tend to yield better quality. Larger models achieve higher scores
overall but have longer inference times and are no more robust to decoding.
Surprisingly, while medical LLMs outperform general ones in two of the five
tasks, statistical analysis shows no overall performance advantage and reveals
greater sensitivity to decoding choice. We further compare multiple evaluation
metrics and find that correlations vary by task, with MAUVE showing weak
agreement with BERTScore and ROUGE, as well as greater sensitivity to the
decoding strategy. These results highlight the need for careful selection of
decoding methods in medical applications, as their influence can sometimes
exceed that of model choice.

### [13] [Who Gets the Mic? Investigating Gender Bias in the Speaker Assignment of a Speech-LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13603)
*Dariia Puhach,Amir H. Payberah,Éva Székely*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨语音大语言模型（Speech-LLMs）是否存在性别偏见，通过分析Bark TTS模型的默认说话人分配来检测系统性偏见模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然语音大语言模型与文本大语言模型一样具有涌现能力和上下文意识，但它们在性别偏见方面的表现尚不清楚。语音模型必须产生带有性别特征的声音，使得说话人选择成为显性的偏见线索。

Method: 构建两个数据集：包含性别刻板印象职业的"职业"数据集和具有性别内涵的"性别色彩词汇"数据集，分析Bark模型对这些文本提示的默认说话人分配。

Result: Bark模型没有表现出系统性偏见，但显示出性别意识并具有一定的性别倾向性。

Conclusion: 语音大语言模型虽然不像文本模型那样隐含编码性别关联，但在说话人选择方面表现出性别意识，需要进一步研究其偏见机制。

Abstract: Similar to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), Speech-LLMs exhibit
emergent abilities and context awareness. However, whether these similarities
extend to gender bias remains an open question. This study proposes a
methodology leveraging speaker assignment as an analytic tool for bias
investigation. Unlike text-based models, which encode gendered associations
implicitly, Speech-LLMs must produce a gendered voice, making speaker selection
an explicit bias cue. We evaluate Bark, a Text-to-Speech (TTS) model, analyzing
its default speaker assignments for textual prompts. If Bark's speaker
selection systematically aligns with gendered associations, it may reveal
patterns in its training data or model design. To test this, we construct two
datasets: (i) Professions, containing gender-stereotyped occupations, and (ii)
Gender-Colored Words, featuring gendered connotations. While Bark does not
exhibit systematic bias, it demonstrates gender awareness and has some gender
inclinations.

Conclusion: 该框架为低资源语言和专门领域提供了可扩展的基础，每个组件都做出了有意义的贡献。

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (Document VQA) faces significant
challenges when processing long documents in low-resource environments due to
context limitations and insufficient training data. This paper presents
AdaDocVQA, a unified adaptive framework addressing these challenges through
three core innovations: a hybrid text retrieval architecture for effective
document segmentation, an intelligent data augmentation pipeline that
automatically generates high-quality reasoning question-answer pairs with
multi-level verification, and adaptive ensemble inference with dynamic
configuration generation and early stopping mechanisms. Experiments on Japanese
document VQA benchmarks demonstrate substantial improvements with 83.04\%
accuracy on Yes/No questions, 52.66\% on factual questions, and 44.12\% on
numerical questions in JDocQA, and 59\% accuracy on LAVA dataset. Ablation
studies confirm meaningful contributions from each component, and our framework
establishes new state-of-the-art results for Japanese document VQA while
providing a scalable foundation for other low-resource languages and
specialized domains. Our code available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CRISP是一种基于稀疏自编码器的参数高效方法，用于实现持久的概念遗忘，通过在多个层中自动识别并抑制关键特征，成功移除有害知识同时保持模型能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在现实应用中的部署增加，需要选择性移除不良知识同时保持模型效用的需求变得至关重要。现有基于稀疏自编码器的方法主要在推理时操作，无法对模型参数进行持久修改，容易被恶意行为者绕过。

Method: CRISP使用稀疏自编码器自动识别多个层中的显著特征，并抑制这些特征的激活。这是一种参数高效的方法，能够实现持久的概念遗忘。

Result: 在两个大语言模型上的实验表明，该方法在WMDP基准测试的安全关键遗忘任务上优于先前方法，成功移除有害知识的同时保持了一般和领域内的能力。特征级分析显示CRISP实现了目标和良性概念之间的语义连贯分离。

Conclusion: CRISP提供了一种有效的参数级干预方法，能够精确抑制目标特征，实现持久的概念遗忘，解决了现有推理时干预方法的局限性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, the need to selectively remove unwanted knowledge while
preserving model utility has become paramount. Recent work has explored sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to perform precise interventions on monosemantic features.
However, most SAE-based methods operate at inference time, which does not
create persistent changes in the model's parameters. Such interventions can be
bypassed or reversed by malicious actors with parameter access. We introduce
CRISP, a parameter-efficient method for persistent concept unlearning using
SAEs. CRISP automatically identifies salient SAE features across multiple
layers and suppresses their activations. We experiment with two LLMs and show
that our method outperforms prior approaches on safety-critical unlearning
tasks from the WMDP benchmark, successfully removing harmful knowledge while
preserving general and in-domain capabilities. Feature-level analysis reveals
that CRISP achieves semantically coherent separation between target and benign
concepts, allowing precise suppression of the target features.

*Vy Tuong Dang,An Vo,Quang Tau,Duc Dm,Daeyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了ViExam基准测试，评估了视觉语言模型在越南语多模态教育考试中的表现，发现当前最先进的VLM仅达到57.74%的准确率，远低于人类平均水平(66.54%)和最佳表现(99.60%)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然视觉语言模型在英语多模态任务上表现出色，但其在低资源语言（如越南语）真实多模态教育内容上的性能尚未得到充分探索，需要研究主要基于英语数据训练的VLM是否能处理跨语言多模态推理任务。

Method: 提出了ViExam基准测试，包含2,548道多模态问题，涵盖7个学术领域（数学、物理、化学、生物、地理、驾驶测试和智商测试），对现有VLM进行全面评估，并测试了跨语言提示和人类协作策略。

Result: 最先进的VLM平均准确率为57.74%，开源模型为27.70%，均低于人类平均水平(66.54%)。只有o3思考型VLM(74.07%)超过人类平均水平，但仍远低于人类最佳表现(99.60%)。跨语言提示反而降低准确率1个百分点，人类协作可提升5个百分点。

Conclusion: 当前VLM在越南语多模态教育评估中表现不佳，跨语言能力有限，需要针对低资源语言开发专门的训练方法和模型架构，人类协作可以部分弥补模型不足。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on English
multimodal tasks, but their performance on low-resource languages with
genuinely multimodal educational content remains largely unexplored. In this
work, we test how VLMs perform on Vietnamese educational assessments,
investigating whether VLMs trained predominantly on English data can handle
real-world cross-lingual multimodal reasoning. Our work presents the first
comprehensive evaluation of VLM capabilities on multimodal Vietnamese exams
through proposing ViExam, a benchmark containing 2,548 multimodal questions. We
find that state-of-the-art VLMs achieve only 57.74% while open-source models
achieve 27.70% mean accuracy across 7 academic domains, including Mathematics,
Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography, Driving Test, and IQ Test. Most VLMs
underperform average human test-takers (66.54%), with only the thinking VLM o3
(74.07%) exceeding human average performance, yet still falling substantially
short of human best performance (99.60%). Cross-lingual prompting with English
instructions while maintaining Vietnamese content fails to improve performance,
decreasing accuracy by 1 percentage point for SOTA VLMs. Human-in-the-loop
collaboration can partially improve VLM performance by 5 percentage points.

### [17] [Generics and Default Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13718)
*James Ravi Kirkpatrick,Rachel Katharine Sterken*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文评估了28个大型语言模型在包含通用泛化的置信推理模式中的表现，发现强大模型在默认推理方面有一定能力，但CoT提示导致性能显著下降，且大多数模型无法区分置信和演绎推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用泛化语句如"鸟会飞"在语言学、哲学、逻辑学和认知科学中具有重要地位，它们允许异常情况的特性对默认推理、认知和概念获取至关重要，需要评估LLM在这些复杂推理模式中的能力。

Method: 研究使用20种不同的置信推理模式，测试28个LLM的表现。比较了零次提示、少次提示和链式思绪（CoT）提示等不同提示方式的效果，采用准确率作为评价指标。

Result: 前沿模型在默认推理问题上表现良好，但不同模型和提示方式间差异显著。少次提示对某些模型有稍微改善，但CoT提示导致性能显著下降（平均准确率下降11.14%，标准差15.74%）。大多数模型无法区分置信和演绎推理，或将通用语句误解为普遍语句。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在默认推理方面既有潜力也有限制。CoT提示的负面效果呈现出这种推理的复杂性，而模型在理解通用语句的置信本质方面仍面临挑战。这为进一步提升LLM的逻辑推理能力指明了方向。

Abstract: This paper evaluates the capabilities of 28 large language models (LLMs) to
reason with 20 defeasible reasoning patterns involving generic generalizations
(e.g., 'Birds fly', 'Ravens are black') central to non-monotonic logic.
Generics are of special interest to linguists, philosophers, logicians, and
cognitive scientists because of their complex exception-permitting behaviour
and their centrality to default reasoning, cognition, and concept acquisition.
We find that while several frontier models handle many default reasoning
problems well, performance varies widely across models and prompting styles.
Few-shot prompting modestly improves performance for some models, but
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting often leads to serious performance degradation
(mean accuracy drop -11.14%, SD 15.74% in models performing above 75% accuracy
in zero-shot condition, temperature 0). Most models either struggle to
distinguish between defeasible and deductive inference or misinterpret generics
as universal statements. These findings underscore both the promise and limits
of current LLMs for default reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文挖深了对词向量知识解释方法的批判性分析，证明仅靠预测准确性无法可靠地表明向量中真正含有语义知识，因为这些方法甚至能预测随机信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别深度学习模型中隐含知识对于提高AI系统可解释性至关重要。但传统方法假设预测语义特征的准确性能够证明向量含有对应知识，这个假设需要重新考量。

Method: 通过实验证明当前的语义特征预测方法甚至能够成功预测随机信息，说明这些方法的效果主要受到算法上限的影响，而非真正反映向量空间中的语义表征。

Result: 预测准确性不能可靠地表明词向量中真正含有语义知识，因为这些方法甚至能预测随机信息。仅依靠预测性能进行数据集比较也不可靠。

Conclusion: 这些映射方法主要反映了向量空间内的几何相似性，而非真正表明了语义属性的出现。需要重新考虑如何评估向量表征中真正含有的知识。

Abstract: Understanding what knowledge is implicitly encoded in deep learning models is
essential for improving the interpretability of AI systems. This paper examines
common methods to explain the knowledge encoded in word embeddings, which are
core elements of large language models (LLMs). These methods typically involve
mapping embeddings onto collections of human-interpretable semantic features,
known as feature norms. Prior work assumes that accurately predicting these
semantic features from the word embeddings implies that the embeddings contain
the corresponding knowledge. We challenge this assumption by demonstrating that
prediction accuracy alone does not reliably indicate genuine feature-based
interpretability.
  We show that these methods can successfully predict even random information,
concluding that the results are predominantly determined by an algorithmic
upper bound rather than meaningful semantic representation in the word
embeddings. Consequently, comparisons between datasets based solely on
prediction performance do not reliably indicate which dataset is better
captured by the word embeddings. Our analysis illustrates that such mappings
primarily reflect geometric similarity within vector spaces rather than
indicating the genuine emergence of semantic properties.

Motivation: 随着EEG在神经科学和临床实践中的广泛应用，如何高效检索和语义解释大规模、多源、异构的EEG数据成为一个迫切挑战。

Method: 提出三层超图框架，将EEG领域知识、个体病例和大规模存储库统一为可遍历的n元关系超图，实现联合语义-时序检索和因果链诊断生成。

Result: 实验表明EEG-MedRAG在答案准确性和检索性能上显著优于TimeRAG和HyperGraphRAG，展现了在真实临床决策支持中的强大潜力。

Conclusion: 该框架为解决EEG数据检索和解释问题提供了有效解决方案，并建立了首个跨疾病、跨角色的EEG临床QA基准，为系统评估疾病无关泛化和角色感知上下文理解提供了基础。

Abstract: With the widespread application of electroencephalography (EEG) in
neuroscience and clinical practice, efficiently retrieving and semantically
interpreting large-scale, multi-source, heterogeneous EEG data has become a
pressing challenge. We propose EEG-MedRAG, a three-layer hypergraph-based
retrieval-augmented generation framework that unifies EEG domain knowledge,
individual patient cases, and a large-scale repository into a traversable n-ary
relational hypergraph, enabling joint semantic-temporal retrieval and
causal-chain diagnostic generation. Concurrently, we introduce the first
cross-disease, cross-role EEG clinical QA benchmark, spanning seven disorders
and five authentic clinical perspectives. This benchmark allows systematic
evaluation of disease-agnostic generalization and role-aware contextual
understanding. Experiments show that EEG-MedRAG significantly outperforms
TimeRAG and HyperGraphRAG in answer accuracy and retrieval, highlighting its
strong potential for real-world clinical decision support. Our data and code

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究大语言模型的奉承性问题，提出了评估框架和Pressure-Tune方法来减少模型在科学问答中随便用户偏见的倾向


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在需要事实严谨的领域常常显示出奉承性，即不须正确性而优先满足用户偏见，这在科学问答等高风险场景中构成严重风险

Method: 提出统一评估框架来量化奉承性影响，包含对抗性提示设置和目标指标；设计Pressure-Tune方法，通过在合成对抗对话上进行轻量精调，配合思维链理由来拒绝用户错误信息

Result: 系统评估显示开源和专有模型都存在普遍的奉承性倾向，主要由对齐策略驱动而非模型大小；Pressure-Tune在具有挑战性的科学问答测试集上显著提升了奉承性抵御力，且不影响准确性或对有效反馈的响应能力

Conclusion: 奉承性是大语言模型在事实性领域的严重问题，Pressure-Tune提供了一种实用的解决方案，能够在不抑制模型正常功能的前提下提升真实性和原则性，为构建更可靠的AI系统提供了实践路径

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), while increasingly used in domains requiring
factual rigor, often display a troubling behavior: sycophancy, the tendency to
align with user beliefs regardless of correctness. This tendency is reinforced
by preference-based alignment techniques that optimize for user satisfaction
but can undermine truthfulness. While relatively benign in casual dialogue,
sycophancy poses serious risks in high-stakes settings such as scientific
question answering (QA), where model outputs may shape collaborative reasoning,
decision-making, and knowledge formation. Despite its importance, this
phenomenon remains underexamined in factual QA contexts. We address this gap by
introducing a unified evaluation framework to quantify the impact of
sycophantic context on model behavior in scientific QA, measuring how much
user-imposed social pressure distorts model outputs. The framework incorporates
adversarial prompting setups and targeted metrics, such as misleading
resistance and sycophancy resistance, that capture a model's ability to
maintain factual consistency under misleading cues. Systematic evaluations
across open-source and proprietary models reveal pervasive sycophantic
tendencies, driven more by alignment strategy than by model size. To mitigate
this issue, we propose Pressure-Tune, a lightweight post-training method that
fine-tunes models on synthetic adversarial dialogues paired with
chain-of-thought rationales. These rationales reject user misinformation while
reinforcing factual commitments. Experiments on challenging scientific QA
benchmarks show that Pressure-Tune significantly enhances sycophancy resistance
without compromising accuracy or responsiveness to valid feedback, offering a
practical pathway toward more truthful and principled model behavior.

TL;DR: MGT-Prism是一种基于频域分析的机器生成文本检测方法，通过低频域过滤和动态频谱对齐策略，在跨域检测任务中优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器生成文本检测器在同域训练测试时表现良好，但在面对域偏移时泛化能力差，需要开发更好的跨域检测方法

Method: 从频域角度分析文本表示，发现机器生成文本和人类撰写文本在频谱模式上存在显著差异。设计低频域过滤模块过滤对域偏移敏感的文档级特征，并使用动态频谱对齐策略提取任务特定和域不变特征

Result: 在3种域泛化场景的11个测试数据集上，MGT-Prism平均准确率提升0.90%，F1分数提升0.92%，优于现有最先进基线方法

Conclusion: 频域分析为机器生成文本检测提供了有效的域泛化解决方案，MGT-Prism方法在跨域检测任务中表现出色

Abstract: Large Language Models have shown growing ability to generate fluent and
coherent texts that are highly similar to the writing style of humans. Current
detectors for Machine-Generated Text (MGT) perform well when they are trained
and tested in the same domain but generalize poorly to unseen domains, due to
domain shift between data from different sources. In this work, we propose
MGT-Prism, an MGT detection method from the perspective of the frequency domain
for better domain generalization. Our key insight stems from analyzing text
representations in the frequency domain, where we observe consistent spectral
patterns across diverse domains, while significant discrepancies in magnitude
emerge between MGT and human-written texts (HWTs). The observation initiates
the design of a low frequency domain filtering module for filtering out the
document-level features that are sensitive to domain shift, and a dynamic
spectrum alignment strategy to extract the task-specific and domain-invariant
features for improving the detector's performance in domain generalization.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGT-Prism outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by an average of 0.90% in accuracy and 0.92% in F1 score on 11 test
datasets across three domain-generalization scenarios.

TL;DR: 这研究评估大语言模型生成文本与实际儿童语言的相似性，发现LLM生成的文本语言特征与儿童语言存在显著差异，少量提示也无法完全模仿儿童语言特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在教育领域的应用增多，需要了解LLM生成文本是否能够模仿儿童语言特征，以确保在儿童教育工具中的适当性。

Method: 使用影片故事作为提示，通过零械提示和少量提示生成两个LLM语料库，与德语儿童语料进行语言心理学性质对比分析，包括词频、词汇丰富度、句长、词性标签和语义相似度等。

Result: LLM生成文本更长但词汇丰富度更低，更多依赖高频词，名词使用不足，语义空间分析显示低相似性。少量提示仅微小提高相似性，仍无法复现儿童语言的词汇和语义模式。

Conclusion: LLM在模仿儿童语言方面有限，在儿童教育工具中使用LLM生成文本需谨慎考虑其适当性，这为语言心理学研究和教育应用提供了重要见解。

Abstract: The role of large language models (LLMs) in education is increasing, yet
little attention has been paid to whether LLM-generated text resembles child
language. This study evaluates how LLMs replicate child-like language by
comparing LLM-generated texts to a collection of German children's descriptions
of picture stories. We generated two LLM-based corpora using the same picture
stories and two prompt types: zero-shot and few-shot prompts specifying a
general age from the children corpus. We conducted a comparative analysis
across psycholinguistic text properties, including word frequency, lexical
richness, sentence and word length, part-of-speech tags, and semantic
similarity with word embeddings. The results show that LLM-generated texts are
longer but less lexically rich, rely more on high-frequency words, and
under-represent nouns. Semantic vector space analysis revealed low similarity,
highlighting differences between the two corpora on the level of corpus
semantics. Few-shot prompt increased similarities between children and LLM text
to a minor extent, but still failed to replicate lexical and semantic patterns.
The findings contribute to our understanding of how LLMs approximate child
language through multimodal prompting (text + image) and give insights into
their use in psycholinguistic research and education while raising important
questions about the appropriateness of LLM-generated language in child-directed
educational tools.

Motivation: 解决LLM生成医学摘要时事实准确性不足的问题，通过提供句子级引用让用户能够追溯原始证据来源。

Method: 提出Track-Then-Sum摘要管道，先进行句子级追踪再进行摘要生成；建立包含7个关键医学方面的标注数据集和4个评估指标。

Result: 实验证明TracSum可作为有效的基准测试集，显式执行句子级追踪能提高生成准确性，融入完整上下文能进一步提升完整性。

Conclusion: TracSum基准和评估框架为可追溯的基于方面的摘要任务提供了有效解决方案，追踪机制显著提升医学摘要的准确性和可信度。

Abstract: While document summarization with LLMs has enhanced access to textual
information, concerns about the factual accuracy of these summaries persist,
especially in the medical domain. Tracing evidence from which summaries are
derived enables users to assess their accuracy, thereby alleviating this
concern. In this paper, we introduce TracSum, a novel benchmark for traceable,
aspect-based summarization, in which generated summaries are paired with
sentence-level citations, enabling users to trace back to the original context.
First, we annotate 500 medical abstracts for seven key medical aspects,
yielding 3.5K summary-citation pairs. We then propose a fine-grained evaluation
framework for this new task, designed to assess the completeness and
consistency of generated content using four metrics. Finally, we introduce a
summarization pipeline, Track-Then-Sum, which serves as a baseline method for
comparison. In experiments, we evaluate both this baseline and a set of LLMs on
TracSum, and conduct a human evaluation to assess the evaluation results. The
findings demonstrate that TracSum can serve as an effective benchmark for
traceable, aspect-based summarization tasks. We also observe that explicitly
performing sentence-level tracking prior to summarization enhances generation
accuracy, while incorporating the full context further improves completeness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 之前的研究多采用确定性真实值标注，无法抓取人类注释者的分歧不确定性。本研究想要通过建模注释者分歧来更全面评估语言模型的道德理解能力。

Method: 采用GPU优化的贝叶斯框架，对Claude Sonnet 4、DeepSeek-V3、Llama 4 Maverick等顶级模型进行评测。基于70余余个注释者的25万+注释，覆盖社交媒体、新闻、论坛等10万+文本。处理了100万+模型查询。

Result: AI模型在道德检测上表现突出，统计排名在前25%的人类注释者之内，平衡准确率远超人类平均水平。特别是误告次数显著少于人类，显示出更敏锐的道德检测能力。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在道德理解方面已经达到了非常高的水平，甚至在某些方面超过了人类注释者的表现。这为AI模型在道德判断和内容审查方面的应用提供了强有力的证据支撑。

Abstract: How do large language models understand moral dimensions compared to humans?
  This first large-scale Bayesian evaluation of market-leading language models
provides the answer. In contrast to prior work using deterministic ground truth
(majority or inclusion rules), we model annotator disagreements to capture both
aleatoric uncertainty (inherent human disagreement) and epistemic uncertainty
(model domain sensitivity). We evaluate top language models (Claude Sonnet 4,
DeepSeek-V3, Llama 4 Maverick) across 250K+ annotations from ~700 annotators on
100K+ texts spanning social media, news, and forums.
  Our GPU-optimized Bayesian framework processed 1M+ model queries, revealing
that AI models typically rank among the top 25\% of human annotators, achieving
much better-than-average balanced accuracy. Importantly, we find that AI
produces far fewer false negatives than humans, highlighting their more
sensitive moral detection capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在文本长度控制方面遇到挑战，经常超过或不足指定长度，因为无法可靠进行内部词元计数

Method: 提出一种基于提示的一次性策略，通过添加倒计数器标记和明确的计数规则，使模型在写作过程中同时进行计数

Result: 在MT-Bench-LI任务中，GPT-4.1的严格长度遵循率从累稀提示下的30%以下提升到95%以下，超越了普遍使用的草稿-然后修计基线方法，同时保持了评价质量

Conclusion: 程序提示工程单独就可以实现准确的长度控制，提供了一种轻量级的替代方案，无需训练或复杂的解码方法

Abstract: Controlling the length of text produced by large language models (LLMs)
remains challenging: models frequently overshoot or undershoot explicit length
instructions because they cannot reliably keep an internal token count. We
present a prompt-based, one-shot strategy that compels an off-the-shelf LLM to
generate exactly a desired number of tokens - words (English) or characters
(Chinese) - without any fine-tuning or iterative sampling. The prompt appends
countdown markers and explicit counting rules so that the model "writes while
counting." We evaluate on four settings: open-ended generation (1-1000 tokens),
XSUM summarization, MT-Bench-LI instruction following, and the LIFEBENCH
equal-length track. On MT-Bench-LI, strict length compliance with GPT-4.1 leaps
from below 30% under naive prompts to above 95% with our countdown prompt,
surpassing the popular draft-then-revise baseline, while judged answer quality
is preserved. These results show that precise length control can be achieved
through prompt engineering alone, offering a lightweight alternative to
training- or decoding-based methods.

Motivation: 自动评估指标在自然语言生成预估中存在重要作用，但当前缺乏统一标准，各种指标在不同任务和数据集上表现不一，需要系统性分析以提供更有效的评估方案

Method: 通过对现有评估指标的方法论、文档化优势和限制、验证方法以及与人类判断的相关性进行深入检查

Result: 发现自动评估指标往往只能抓取文本质量的特定方面，在不同任务和数据集上效果差异显著，验证实践结构化不足，与人类判断的相关性不稳定，这些问题在最新的LLM作为评测者和RAG任务中仍然存在

Conclusion: 对完美评估指标的寻求是不现实的，应根据具体任务需求选择适当的指标，利用补充性评估方法，并建议新指标应重点关注改进验证方法论

Abstract: Evaluating Natural Language Generation (NLG) is crucial for the practical
adoption of AI, but has been a longstanding research challenge. While human
evaluation is considered the de-facto standard, it is expensive and lacks
scalability. Practical applications have driven the development of various
automatic evaluation metrics (AEM), designed to compare the model output with
human-written references, generating a score which approximates human judgment.
Over time, AEMs have evolved from simple lexical comparisons, to semantic
similarity models and, more recently, to LLM-based evaluators. However, it
seems that no single metric has emerged as a definitive solution, resulting in
studies using different ones without fully considering the implications. This
paper aims to show this by conducting a thorough examination of the
methodologies of existing metrics, their documented strengths and limitations,
validation methods, and correlations with human judgment. We identify several
key challenges: metrics often capture only specific aspects of text quality,
their effectiveness varies by task and dataset, validation practices remain
unstructured, and correlations with human judgment are inconsistent.
Importantly, we find that these challenges persist in the most recent type of
metric, LLM-as-a-Judge, as well as in the evaluation of Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG), an increasingly relevant task in academia and industry. Our
findings challenge the quest for the 'perfect metric'. We propose selecting
metrics based on task-specific needs and leveraging complementary evaluations
and advocate that new metrics should focus on enhanced validation

Abstract: This study explores the integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM)
with Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automate the extraction of
requirements from unstructured French Building Technical Specification (BTS)
documents within the construction industry. Employing Named Entity Recognition
(NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) techniques, the study leverages the
transformer-based model CamemBERT and applies transfer learning with the French
language model Fr\_core\_news\_lg, both pre-trained on a large French corpus in
the general domain. To benchmark these models, additional approaches ranging
from rule-based to deep learning-based methods are developed. For RE, four
different supervised models, including Random Forest, are implemented using a
custom feature vector. A hand-crafted annotated dataset is used to compare the
effectiveness of NER approaches and RE models. Results indicate that CamemBERT
and Fr\_core\_news\_lg exhibited superior performance in NER, achieving
F1-scores over 90\%, while Random Forest proved most effective in RE, with an
F1 score above 80\%. The outcomes are intended to be represented as a knowledge
graph in future work to further enhance automatic verification systems.

### [28] [MME-SCI: A Comprehensive and Challenging Science Benchmark for Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13938)
*Jiacheng Ruan,Dan Jiang,Xian Gao,Ting Liu,Yuzhuo Fu,Yangyang Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MME-SCI是一个针对多模态大语言模型在科学领域推理能力评估的新基准，涵盖数学、物理、化学、生物四大学科，支持五种语言，包含1019个高质量问答对，评估结果显示现有模型在该基准上表现显著较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有科学领域评估基准存在三个关键挑战：多语言场景下推理能力评估不足、多模态覆盖不充分、科学知识点标注粒度不够细。为了解决这些问题，作者提出了MME-SCI基准。

Method: 收集了1019个高质量问答对，涵盖数学、物理、化学、生物四大学科，支持中文、英文、法文、西班牙文和日文五种语言，包含3种不同的评估模式。对16个开源模型和4个闭源模型进行了广泛实验。

Result: 实验结果表明MME-SCI对现有MLLMs具有广泛挑战性。在仅图像评估模式下，o4-mini在数学、物理、化学、生物上的准确率分别仅为52.11%、24.73%、36.57%和29.80%，难度显著高于现有基准。

Conclusion: MME-SCI是一个全面且具有挑战性的基准，能够深入分析现有模型在特定领域的弱点，通过其多语言和细粒度知识属性为模型评估提供了更全面的视角。

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved significant
advancements across various domains, and corresponding evaluation benchmarks
have been continuously refined and improved. In this process, benchmarks in the
scientific domain have played an important role in assessing the reasoning
capabilities of MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks still face three key
challenges: 1) Insufficient evaluation of models' reasoning abilities in
multilingual scenarios; 2) Inadequate assessment of MLLMs' comprehensive
modality coverage; 3) Lack of fine-grained annotation of scientific knowledge
points. To address these gaps, we propose MME-SCI, a comprehensive and
challenging benchmark. We carefully collected 1,019 high-quality
question-answer pairs, which involve 3 distinct evaluation modes. These pairs
cover four subjects, namely mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, and
support five languages: Chinese, English, French, Spanish, and Japanese. We
conducted extensive experiments on 16 open-source models and 4 closed-source
models, and the results demonstrate that MME-SCI is widely challenging for
existing MLLMs. For instance, under the Image-only evaluation mode, o4-mini
achieved accuracy of only 52.11%, 24.73%, 36.57%, and 29.80% in mathematics,
physics, chemistry, and biology, respectively, indicating a significantly
higher difficulty level compared to existing benchmarks. More importantly,
using MME-SCI's multilingual and fine-grained knowledge attributes, we analyzed
existing models' performance in depth and identified their weaknesses in
specific domains. The Data and Evaluation Code are available at

Conclusion: 图谱表示在评论分析中具有潜力，为未来集成图神经网络和微调LLM提取方法奠定了基础，框架已开源

Abstract: In the hospitality industry, understanding the factors that drive customer
review ratings is critical for improving guest satisfaction and business
performance. This work proposes ReviewGraph for Review Rating Prediction (RRP),
a novel framework that transforms textual customer reviews into knowledge
graphs by extracting (subject, predicate, object) triples and associating
sentiment scores. Using graph embeddings (Node2Vec) and sentiment features, the
framework predicts review rating scores through machine learning classifiers.
We compare ReviewGraph performance with traditional NLP baselines (such as Bag
of Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec) and large language models (LLMs), evaluating
them in the HotelRec dataset. In comparison to the state of the art literature,
our proposed model performs similar to their best performing model but with
lower computational cost (without ensemble).
  While ReviewGraph achieves comparable predictive performance to LLMs and
outperforms baselines on agreement-based metrics such as Cohen's Kappa, it
offers additional advantages in interpretability, visual exploration, and
potential integration into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. This
work highlights the potential of graph-based representations for enhancing
review analytics and lays the groundwork for future research integrating
advanced graph neural networks and fine-tuned LLM-based extraction methods. We
will share ReviewGraph output and platform open-sourced on our GitHub page

Abstract: Long-context modeling is critical for a wide range of real-world tasks,
including long-context question answering, summarization, and complex reasoning
tasks. Recent studies have explored fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs)
with synthetic data to enhance their long-context capabilities. However, the
effectiveness of such approaches is often limited by the low diversity and
factual inconsistencies in the generated data. To address these challenges, we
propose LongMab-PO, a novel framework that leverages a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)
rollout strategy to identify the most informative chunks from the given long
context for sampling high-quality and diverse responses and constructing
preference data pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training.
Specifically, we treat context chunks as arms of MAB, select chunks based on
their expected reward scores to input into LLMs to generate responses, and
iteratively update these scores based on reward feedback. This exploration and
exploitation process enables the model to focus on the most relevant context
segments, thereby generating and collecting high-quality and diverse responses.
Finally, we collect these generated responses from the rollout process and
apply the DPO method to further optimize the LLM. Experimental results show
that LongMab-PO significantly improves the diversity and quality of preference
data pairs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on long-context reasoning
benchmarks. All code and data will be released on

*Xiao Liang,Zhongzhi Li,Yeyun Gong,Yelong Shen,Ying Nian Wu,Zhijiang Guo,Weizhu Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLVR训练会降低策略熵和生成多样性，影响Pass@k性能。本文提出SvS策略，通过自对弈和变分问题合成来维持策略熵，显著提升Pass@k性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准RLVR训练虽然能提高Pass@1性能，但会导致策略熵下降和生成多样性减少，从而限制了Pass@k性能的提升，而Pass@k通常代表LLM推理能力的上限。

Method: 提出在线自对弈与变分问题合成(SvS)策略，利用策略的正确解合成变分问题（保持参考答案不变），在训练过程中有效维持策略熵。

Result: 在AIME24和AIME25基准测试中，Pass@32性能分别获得18.3%和22.8%的绝对提升。在12个推理基准和3B到32B不同模型规模上的实验一致证明了SvS的泛化性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SvS策略通过维持策略熵有效解决了RLVR训练中的多样性下降问题，显著提升了Pass@k性能，为LLM的复杂推理任务训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a key paradigm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for
complex reasoning tasks. However, vanilla RLVR training has been shown to
improve Pass@1 performance at the expense of policy entropy, leading to reduced
generation diversity and limiting the Pass@k performance, which typically
represents the upper bound of LLM reasoning capability. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the policy's generation diversity from the perspective
of training problems and find that augmenting and updating training problems
helps mitigate entropy collapse during training. Based on these observations,
we propose an online Self-play with Variational problem Synthesis (SvS)
strategy for RLVR training, which uses the policy's correct solutions to
synthesize variational problems while ensuring their reference answers remain
identical to the originals. This self-improving strategy effectively maintains
policy entropy during training and substantially improves Pass@k compared with
standard RLVR, sustaining prolonged improvements and achieving absolute gains
of 18.3% and 22.8% in Pass@32 performance on the competition-level AIME24 and
AIME25 benchmarks. Experiments on 12 reasoning benchmarks across varying model
sizes from 3B to 32B consistently demonstrate the generalizability and
robustness of SvS.

TL;DR: 大语言模型在细调为代理系统时存在安全风险，可能导致有害任务执行率提高。本文提出PING方法，通过注入自动生成的自然语言前缀来提升代理安全性，同时保持良好任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在细调为代理系统时，安全问题经常被忽视。研究发现对齐的LLM在细调后可能变得不对齐，更容易执行有害任务且拒绝率降低。

Method: 提出Prefix INjection Guard (PING)方法：通过在代理响应前注入自动生成的自然语言前缀，指导代理拒绝有害请求。采用迭代方法，交替生成候选前缀和选择最优前缀，以优化任务性能和拒绝行为。

Result: 实验结果显示PING显著提升了细调后LLM代理的安全性，而不爆弃其有效性。在网页导航和代码生成任务的多样化测试中，PING持续超过现有提示方法。线性探针分析显示前缀标记对行为修改至关重要。

Conclusion: PING是一种简单但有效的方法，能够在保持代理性能的同时显著提升大语言模型代理的安全性。该方法通过自然语言前缀注入来引导代理拒绝有害请求，为LLM代理安全问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Beyond simple text generation, Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into
agentic systems capable of planning and interacting with external tools to
solve complex tasks. This evolution involves fine-tuning LLMs on agent-specific
tasks to enhance their proficiency. However, safety concerns are frequently
overlooked during this fine-tuning process. In this work, we show that aligned
LLMs can become unintentionally misaligned, leading to a higher likelihood of
executing harmful tasks and a reduced tendency to refuse them when fine-tuned
to execute agentic tasks. To address these safety challenges, we propose Prefix
INjection Guard (PING), a simple yet effective method that prepends
automatically generated natural language prefixes to agent responses, guiding
them to refuse harmful requests while preserving performance on benign tasks.
Specifically, we introduce an iterative approach that alternates between (1)
generating candidate prefixes and (2) selecting those that optimize both task
performance and refusal behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that PING
significantly enhances the safety of fine-tuned LLM agents without sacrificing
their effectiveness. PING consistently outperforms existing prompting
approaches across diverse benchmarks in both web navigation and code generation
tasks. Our analysis of internal hidden states via linear probes reveals that
prefix tokens are crucial for behavior modification, explaining the performance
gains. WARNING: This paper contains contents that are unethical or offensive in

Abstract: Digital health analytics face critical challenges nowadays. The sophisticated
analysis of patient-generated health content, which contains complex emotional
and medical contexts, requires scarce domain expertise, while traditional ML
approaches are constrained by data shortage and privacy limitations in
healthcare settings. Online Health Communities (OHCs) exemplify these
challenges with mixed-sentiment posts, clinical terminology, and implicit
emotional expressions that demand specialised knowledge for accurate Sentiment
Analysis (SA). To address these challenges, this study explores how Large
Language Models (LLMs) can integrate expert knowledge through in-context
learning for SA, providing a scalable solution for sophisticated health data
analysis. Specifically, we develop a structured codebook that systematically
encodes expert interpretation guidelines, enabling LLMs to apply
domain-specific knowledge through targeted prompting rather than extensive
training. Six GPT models validated alongside DeepSeek and LLaMA 3.1 are
compared with pre-trained language models (BioBERT variants) and lexicon-based
methods, using 400 expert-annotated posts from two OHCs. LLMs achieve superior
performance while demonstrating expert-level agreement. This high agreement,
with no statistically significant difference from inter-expert agreement
levels, suggests knowledge integration beyond surface-level pattern
recognition. The consistent performance across diverse LLM models, supported by
in-context learning, offers a promising solution for digital health analytics.
This approach addresses the critical challenge of expert knowledge shortage in
digital health research, enabling real-time, expert-quality analysis for
patient monitoring, intervention assessment, and evidence-based health
strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有疲劳检测方法存在侵入性、硬件依赖或小目标检测效果差等问题，需要开发非侵入式、鲁棒性强的实时检测方案。

Method: 提出YOLO11-CR模型，包含卷积-注意力融合模块(CAFM)整合CNN局部特征和Transformer全局上下文，以及矩形校准模块(RCM)捕获水平和垂直上下文信息。

Result: 在DSM数据集上达到87.17%精确率、83.86%召回率、88.09% mAP@50和55.93% mAP@50-95，显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: YOLO11-CR为车载疲劳监控提供了实用高效解决方案，具有实际部署潜力，未来可扩展时序建模和多模态数据融合。

Abstract: Driver fatigue detection is of paramount importance for intelligent
transportation systems due to its critical role in mitigating road traffic
accidents. While physiological and vehicle dynamics-based methods offer
accuracy, they are often intrusive, hardware-dependent, and lack robustness in
real-world environments. Vision-based techniques provide a non-intrusive and
scalable alternative, but still face challenges such as poor detection of small
or occluded objects and limited multi-scale feature modeling. To address these
issues, this paper proposes YOLO11-CR, a lightweight and efficient object
detection model tailored for real-time fatigue detection. YOLO11-CR introduces
two key modules: the Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM), which
integrates local CNN features with global Transformer-based context to enhance
feature expressiveness; and the Rectangular Calibration Module (RCM), which
captures horizontal and vertical contextual information to improve spatial
localization, particularly for profile faces and small objects like mobile
phones. Experiments on the DSM dataset demonstrated that YOLO11-CR achieves a
precision of 87.17%, recall of 83.86%, mAP@50 of 88.09%, and mAP@50-95 of
55.93%, outperforming baseline models significantly. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of the CAFM and RCM modules in improving both
sensitivity and localization accuracy. These results demonstrate that YOLO11-CR
offers a practical and high-performing solution for in-vehicle fatigue
monitoring, with strong potential for real-world deployment and future
enhancements involving temporal modeling, multi-modal data integration, and
embedded optimization.

Conclusion: Mirage基准和Mirage-R1模型有效解决了真实世界AI生成图像检测问题，在性能和推理速度之间取得了良好平衡

Abstract: The spreading of AI-generated images (AIGI), driven by advances in generative
AI, poses a significant threat to information security and public trust.
Existing AIGI detectors, while effective against images in clean laboratory
settings, fail to generalize to in-the-wild scenarios. These real-world images
are noisy, varying from ``obviously fake" images to realistic ones derived from
multiple generative models and further edited for quality control. We address
in-the-wild AIGI detection in this paper. We introduce Mirage, a challenging
benchmark designed to emulate the complexity of in-the-wild AIGI. Mirage is
constructed from two sources: (1) a large corpus of Internet-sourced AIGI
verified by human experts, and (2) a synthesized dataset created through the
collaboration between multiple expert generators, closely simulating the
realistic AIGI in the wild. Building on this benchmark, we propose Mirage-R1, a
vision-language model with heuristic-to-analytic reasoning, a reflective
reasoning mechanism for AIGI detection. Mirage-R1 is trained in two stages: a
supervised-fine-tuning cold start, followed by a reinforcement learning stage.
By further adopting an inference-time adaptive thinking strategy, Mirage-R1 is
able to provide either a quick judgment or a more robust and accurate
conclusion, effectively balancing inference speed and performance. Extensive
experiments show that our model leads state-of-the-art detectors by 5% and 10%
on Mirage and the public benchmark, respectively. The benchmark and code will
be made publicly available.

Result: 在ReST和OmniDocBench基准测试中，DianJin-OCR-R1模型持续优于非推理版本和专家OCR模型，证明了方法的有效性

Conclusion: 通过推理增强和工具调用机制，成功解决了LVLMs在OCR任务中的幻觉问题，以较低成本实现了性能提升，为视觉语言模型的实际应用提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have enabled a new
paradigm of end-to-end document image parsing, excelling in Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) tasks such as text, table, and formula recognition. However,
generative LVLMs, similarly to large language models (LLMs), are prone to
hallucinations--generating words that do not exist in input images.
Furthermore, LVLMs are designed for general purposes and tend to be less
effective on OCR tasks compared to expert models that are trained on
domain-specific datasets. In this paper, we propose DianJin-OCR-R1, a
reasoning-enhanced framework designed to address these limitations through
training reasoning-and-tool interleaved VLMs. Given a recognition instruction,
our DianJin-OCR-R1 model first recognizes the content in the input image by its
own OCR capabilities, and then calls other tools (i.e., other expert models) to
obtain their results as references, finally looks again the image and rethinks
about the reasoning process to provide the final recognized content. Since
architectures of expert models are tailored for specific OCR tasks, which makes
them less prone to hallucinations, their results can help VLMs mitigate
hallucinations. Additionally, expert models are typically smaller in scale and
easy to iterate, enabling performance improvements for VLMs at a lower cost. We
evaluate our model on ReST and OmniDocBench, and experimental results show that
our DianJin-OCR-R1 models consistently outperform their non-reasoning
counterparts and expert OCR models, which proves the effectiveness of our
method.

Abstract: Urdu is a cursive script language and has similarities with Arabic and many
other South Asian languages. Urdu is difficult to classify due to its complex
geometrical and morphological structure. Character classification can be
processed further if segmentation technique is efficient, but due to context
sensitivity in Urdu, segmentation-based recognition often results with high
error rate. Our proposed approach for Urdu optical character recognition system
is a component-based classification relying on automatic feature learning
technique called convolutional neural network. CNN is trained and tested on
Urdu text dataset, which is generated through permutation process of three
characters and further proceeds to discarding unnecessary images by applying
connected component technique in order to obtain ligature only. Hierarchical
neural network is implemented with two levels to deal with three degrees of
character permutations and component classification Our model successfully
achieved 0.99% for component classification.

Conclusion: 难度感知训练策略在标签不确定性下能有效改进有序分类，具有实际应用潜力

Abstract: Estimating disease severity from endoscopic images is essential in assessing
ulcerative colitis, where the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) is widely used to
grade inflammation. However, MES classification remains challenging due to
label noise from inter-observer variability and the ordinal nature of the
score, which standard models often ignore. We propose CLoE, a curriculum
learning framework that accounts for both label reliability and ordinal
structure. Image quality, estimated via a lightweight model trained on Boston
Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) labels, is used as a proxy for annotation
confidence to order samples from easy (clean) to hard (noisy). This curriculum
is further combined with ResizeMix augmentation to improve robustness.
Experiments on the LIMUC and HyperKvasir datasets, using both CNNs and
Transformers, show that CLoE consistently improves performance over strong

Conclusion: 该工作展示了扩散模型在高质量、可控且隐私保护的步态数据生成方面的应用价值，为步态识别领域提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Gait recognition is a valuable biometric task that enables the identification
of individuals from a distance based on their walking patterns. However, it
remains limited by the lack of large-scale labeled datasets and the difficulty
of collecting diverse gait samples for each individual while preserving
privacy. To address these challenges, we propose GaitCrafter, a diffusion-based
framework for synthesizing realistic gait sequences in the silhouette domain.
Unlike prior works that rely on simulated environments or alternative
generative models, GaitCrafter trains a video diffusion model from scratch,
exclusively on gait silhouette data. Our approach enables the generation of
temporally consistent and identity-preserving gait sequences. Moreover, the
generation process is controllable-allowing conditioning on various covariates
such as clothing, carried objects, and view angle. We show that incorporating
synthetic samples generated by GaitCrafter into the gait recognition pipeline
leads to improved performance, especially under challenging conditions.
Additionally, we introduce a mechanism to generate novel identities-synthetic
individuals not present in the original dataset-by interpolating identity
embeddings. These novel identities exhibit unique, consistent gait patterns and
are useful for training models while maintaining privacy of real subjects.
Overall, our work takes an important step toward leveraging diffusion models
for high-quality, controllable, and privacy-aware gait data generation.

TL;DR: Prune2Drive是一个用于自动驾驶多视角视觉语言模型的即插即用视觉token剪枝框架，通过多样性感知token选择和视图自适应剪枝控制，在保持性能的同时显著提升推理速度和减少内存消耗


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统中的多视角视觉语言模型处理高分辨率图像时计算开销巨大，视觉token数量过多导致推理延迟和内存消耗问题

Method: 提出两种核心创新：1）受最远点采样启发的多样性感知token选择机制，优先考虑跨视图的语义和空间覆盖；2）基于视图重要性的自适应剪枝控制器，为每个摄像头学习最优剪枝比例

Result: 在DriveLM和DriveLMM-o1基准测试中，仅保留10%视觉token即可实现6.4倍预填充加速和13.4%的FLOPs消耗，性能仅下降3%

Conclusion: Prune2Drive无需模型重训练或注意力图访问，与现代高效注意力实现兼容，为多视角VLM在自动驾驶中的实际部署提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm in
autonomous driving (AD), offering a unified framework for perception,
reasoning, and decision-making by jointly modeling visual inputs and natural
language instructions. However, their deployment is hindered by the significant
computational overhead incurred when processing high-resolution, multi-view
images, a standard setup in AD systems with six or more synchronized cameras.
This overhead stems from the large number of visual tokens generated during
encoding, increasing inference latency and memory consumption due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. To address these challenges, we propose
Prune2Drive, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for multi-view VLMs
in autonomous driving. Prune2Drive introduces two core innovations: (i) a
diversity-aware token selection mechanism inspired by farthest point sampling,
which prioritizes semantic and spatial coverage across views rather than
relying solely on attention scores, and (ii) a view-adaptive pruning controller
that learns optimal pruning ratios for each camera view based on their
importance to downstream driving tasks. Unlike prior methods, Prune2Drive does
not require model retraining or access to attention maps, making it compatible
with modern efficient attention implementations. Extensive experiments on two
large-scale multi-view driving benchmarks, DriveLM and DriveLMM-o1, show that
Prune2Drive achieves significant speedups and memory savings while maintaining
or improving task performance. When retaining only 10% of the visual tokens,
our method achieves a 6.40$\times$ speedup in the prefilling phase and consumes
13.4% of the original FLOPs, with only a 3% performance drop on the DriveLM
benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAASH是一个完全可微分的元攻击框架，通过策略性地组合现有的Lp范数攻击方法，生成有效且感知对齐的对抗样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Lp范数约束对抗样本往往与人类感知不一致，且不清楚Lp约束攻击的见解是否能有效提升感知效果。

Method: 采用多阶段方式：每阶段使用学习到的自适应权重聚合多个基础攻击的候选对抗样本，并通过新颖的元损失函数联合最小化误分类损失和感知失真。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet上显著优于最先进的感知攻击，攻击成功率提高20.63%，SSIM、LPIPS和FID指标分别提升约11、0.015和5.7。

Conclusion: DAASH能够很好地泛化到未见过的防御方法，是评估鲁棒性的实用且强大的基线，无需为每种新防御手工设计自适应攻击。

Abstract: Numerous techniques have been proposed for generating adversarial examples in
white-box settings under strict Lp-norm constraints. However, such norm-bounded
examples often fail to align well with human perception, and only recently have
a few methods begun specifically exploring perceptually aligned adversarial
examples. Moreover, it remains unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained
attacks can be effectively leveraged to improve perceptual efficacy. In this
paper, we introduce DAASH, a fully differentiable meta-attack framework that
generates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by
strategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods. DAASH operates in a
multi-stage fashion: at each stage, it aggregates candidate adversarial
examples from multiple base attacks using learned, adaptive weights and
propagates the result to the next stage. A novel meta-loss function guides this
process by jointly minimizing misclassification loss and perceptual distortion,
enabling the framework to dynamically modulate the contribution of each base
attack throughout the stages. We evaluate DAASH on adversarially trained models
across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Despite relying solely on
Lp-constrained based methods, DAASH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
perceptual attacks such as AdvAD -- achieving higher attack success rates
(e.g., 20.63\% improvement) and superior visual quality, as measured by SSIM,
LPIPS, and FID (improvements $\approx$ of 11, 0.015, and 5.7, respectively).
Furthermore, DAASH generalizes well to unseen defenses, making it a practical
and strong baseline for evaluating robustness without requiring handcrafted
adaptive attacks for each new defense.

Abstract: We introduce a scalable, interpretable computer-vision framework for
quantifying aesthetic outcomes of facial plastic surgery using frontal
photographs. Our pipeline leverages automated landmark detection, geometric
facial symmetry computation, deep-learning-based age estimation, and nasal
morphology analysis. To perform this study, we first assemble the largest
curated dataset of paired pre- and post-operative facial images to date,
encompassing 7,160 photographs from 1,259 patients. This dataset includes a
dedicated rhinoplasty-only subset consisting of 732 images from 366 patients,
96.2% of whom showed improvement in at least one of the three nasal
measurements with statistically significant group-level change. Among these
patients, the greatest statistically significant improvements (p < 0.001)
occurred in the alar width to face width ratio (77.0%), nose length to face
height ratio (41.5%), and alar width to intercanthal ratio (39.3%). Among the
broader frontal-view cohort, comprising 989 rigorously filtered subjects, 71.3%
exhibited significant enhancements in global facial symmetry or perceived age
(p < 0.01). Importantly, our analysis shows that patient identity remains
consistent post-operatively, with True Match Rates of 99.5% and 99.6% at a
False Match Rate of 0.01% for the rhinoplasty-specific and general patient
cohorts, respectively. Additionally, we analyze inter-practitioner variability
in improvement rates. By providing reproducible, quantitative benchmarks and a
novel dataset, our pipeline facilitates data-driven surgical planning, patient
counseling, and objective outcome evaluation across practices.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural
language processing and multi-modal understanding. However, their high
computational cost, limited accessibility, and data privacy concerns hinder
their adoption in resource-constrained healthcare environments. This study
investigates the performance of small language models (SLMs) in a medical
imaging classification task, comparing different models and prompt designs to
identify the optimal combination for accuracy and usability. Using the NIH
Chest X-ray dataset, we evaluate multiple SLMs on the task of classifying chest
X-ray positions (anteroposterior [AP] vs. posteroanterior [PA]) under three
prompt strategies: baseline instruction, incremental summary prompts, and
correction-based reflective prompts. Our results show that certain SLMs achieve
competitive accuracy with well-crafted prompts, suggesting that prompt
engineering can substantially enhance SLM performance in healthcare
applications without requiring deep AI expertise from end users.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现多选VQA基准中存在Easy-Options Bias问题，VLMs仅凭视觉和选项就能选择正确答案，无需问题。提出GroundAttack工具生成视觉相似的负选项，创建无偏数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA基准存在选项偏差，模型可以通过视觉-选项相似度匹配直接推断答案，无需理解问题，导致评估结果虚高。

Method: 通过接地实验分析偏差原因，开发GroundAttack工具自动生成视觉上与正确答案相似的困难负选项，创建EOB-free标注数据。

Result: 在无偏数据集上，当前VLMs在(V+O)设置下接近随机准确率，在(V+Q+O)设置下准确率显著下降，提供了更真实的VLM能力评估。

Conclusion: 揭示了VQA基准中的选项偏差问题，提出的解决方案能生成更公平的评估数据集，有助于更准确地衡量VLMs的真实问答能力。

Abstract: In this early study, we observe an Easy-Options Bias (EOB) issue in some
multiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks such as MMStar,
RealWorldQA, SEED-Bench, Next-QA, STAR benchmark and Video-MME. This bias
allows vision-language models (VLMs) to select the correct answer using only
the vision (V) and options (O) as inputs, without the need for the question
(Q). Through grounding experiments, we attribute the bias to an imbalance in
visual relevance: the correct answer typically aligns more closely with the
visual contents than the negative options in feature space, creating a shortcut
for VLMs to infer the answer via simply vision-option similarity matching. To
fix this, we introduce GroundAttack, a toolkit that automatically generates
hard negative options as visually plausible as the correct answer. We apply it
to the NExT-QA and MMStar datasets, creating new EOB-free annotations. On these
EOB-free annotations, current VLMs approach to random accuracies under (V+O)
settings, and drop to non-saturated accuracies under (V+Q+O) settings,
providing a more realistic evaluation of VLMs' QA ability. Codes and new
annotations will be released soon.

Conclusion: 有效的知识蓄粉和结构化多代理监督能够让轻量级模型掌握复杂的推理能力，VISTA的紧凑架构有助于在边缘设备上高效部署，实现实时风险监控而无需大规模基础设施升级。

Abstract: Comprehensive highway scene understanding and robust traffic risk inference
are vital for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and
generalization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of
real-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
structured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables
automatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual
risk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models
(VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy
to produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as
knowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much
smaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision
for Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding
low-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware
captions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves
strong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR,
ROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This
demonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent
supervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning
capabilities. The compact architecture of VISTA facilitates efficient
deployment on edge devices, enabling real-time risk monitoring without
requiring extensive infrastructure upgrades.

Conclusion: EDTalk++提供了一个完整的解耦框架，解决了现有方法在面部特征独立控制和多模态输入适应方面的不足，具有很好的应用前景。

Abstract: Achieving disentangled control over multiple facial motions and accommodating
diverse input modalities greatly enhances the application and entertainment of
the talking head generation. This necessitates a deep exploration of the
decoupling space for facial features, ensuring that they a) operate
independently without mutual interference and b) can be preserved to share with
different modal inputs, both aspects often neglected in existing methods. To
address this gap, this paper proposes EDTalk++, a novel full disentanglement
framework for controllable talking head generation. Our framework enables
individual manipulation of mouth shape, head pose, eye movement, and emotional
expression, conditioned on video or audio inputs. Specifically, we employ four
lightweight modules to decompose the facial dynamics into four distinct latent
spaces representing mouth, pose, eye, and expression, respectively. Each space
is characterized by a set of learnable bases whose linear combinations define
specific motions. To ensure independence and accelerate training, we enforce
orthogonality among bases and devise an efficient training strategy to allocate
motion responsibilities to each space without relying on external knowledge.
The learned bases are then stored in corresponding banks, enabling shared
visual priors with audio input. Furthermore, considering the properties of each
space, we propose an Audio-to-Motion module for audio-driven talking head
synthesis. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of
EDTalk++.

Abstract: Kidney stone classification from endoscopic images is critical for
personalized treatment and recurrence prevention. While convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) have shown promise in this task, their limited ability to
capture long-range dependencies can hinder performance under variable imaging
conditions. This study presents a comparative analysis between Vision
Transformers (ViTs) and CNN-based models, evaluating their performance on two
ex vivo datasets comprising CCD camera and flexible ureteroscope images. The
ViT-base model pretrained on ImageNet-21k consistently outperformed a ResNet50
baseline across multiple imaging conditions. For instance, in the most visually
complex subset (Section patches from endoscopic images), the ViT model achieved
95.2% accuracy and 95.1% F1-score, compared to 64.5% and 59.3% with ResNet50.
In the mixed-view subset from CCD-camera images, ViT reached 87.1% accuracy
versus 78.4% with CNN. These improvements extend across precision and recall as
well. The results demonstrate that ViT-based architectures provide superior
classification performance and offer a scalable alternative to conventional
CNNs for kidney stone image analysis.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) aim to parameterize discrete signals
through implicit continuous functions. However, formulating each image with a
separate neural network~(typically, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)) leads to
computational and storage inefficiencies when encoding multi-images. To address
this issue, we propose MINR, sharing specific layers to encode multi-image
efficiently. We first compare the layer-wise weight distributions for several
trained INRs and find that corresponding intermediate layers follow highly
similar distribution patterns. Motivated by this, we share these intermediate
layers across multiple images while preserving the input and output layers as
input-specific. In addition, we design an extra novel projection layer for each
image to capture its unique features. Experimental results on image
reconstruction and super-resolution tasks demonstrate that MINR can save up to
60\% parameters while maintaining comparable performance. Particularly, MINR
scales effectively to handle 100 images, maintaining an average peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 34 dB. Further analysis of various backbones
proves the robustness of the proposed MINR.

TL;DR: DHQ是一种针对隐式神经表示(INRs)的分布感知哈达玛量化方案，同时对权重和激活进行量化，通过哈达玛变换将不同分布标准化为统一钟形分布，显著提升硬件效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的INR量化方法主要关注权重量化，缺乏激活量化，硬件节省有限。INRs中不同层的权重和激活分布差异显著，需要统一的量化方案来充分利用量化带来的硬件优势。

Method: 提出DHQ方案，利用哈达玛变换将不同层的权重和激活分布标准化为统一的钟形分布，然后应用标准量化器。该方法支持FPGA硬件实现，优化硬件效率。

Result: 在多种图像重建任务中，DHQ相比全精度版本减少延迟32.7%、能耗40.1%、资源使用率最高达98.3%，优于之前的量化方法。

Conclusion: DHQ通过分布感知的哈达玛量化有效解决了INRs中权重和激活分布差异问题，实现了显著的硬件效率提升，为INRs的硬件部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals using
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with complex activation functions. While INRs
achieve superior performance, they depend on full-precision number
representation for accurate computation, resulting in significant hardware
overhead. Previous INR quantization approaches have primarily focused on weight
quantization, offering only limited hardware savings due to the lack of
activation quantization. To fully exploit the hardware benefits of
quantization, we propose DHQ, a novel distribution-aware Hadamard quantization
scheme that targets both weights and activations in INRs. Our analysis shows
that the weights in the first and last layers have distributions distinct from
those in the intermediate layers, while the activations in the last layer
differ significantly from those in the preceding layers. Instead of customizing
quantizers individually, we utilize the Hadamard transformation to standardize
these diverse distributions into a unified bell-shaped form, supported by both
empirical evidence and theoretical analysis, before applying a standard
quantizer. To demonstrate the practical advantages of our approach, we present
an FPGA implementation of DHQ that highlights its hardware efficiency.
Experiments on diverse image reconstruction tasks show that DHQ outperforms
previous quantization methods, reducing latency by 32.7\%, energy consumption
by 40.1\%, and resource utilization by up to 98.3\% compared to full-precision
counterparts.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals in a
continuous manner using neural networks, demonstrating significant value across
various multimedia applications. However, the vulnerability of INRs presents a
critical challenge for their real-world deployments, as the network weights
might be subjected to unavoidable perturbations. In this work, we investigate
the robustness of INRs for the first time and find that even minor
perturbations can lead to substantial performance degradation in the quality of
signal reconstruction. To mitigate this issue, we formulate the robustness
problem in INRs by minimizing the difference between loss with and without
weight perturbations. Furthermore, we derive a novel robust loss function to
regulate the gradient of the reconstruction loss with respect to weights,
thereby enhancing the robustness. Extensive experiments on reconstruction tasks
across multiple modalities demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 7.5~dB
improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values compared to original
INRs under noisy conditions.

Motivation: 微表情持续时间短、强度低，传统深度学习方法难以有效提取其细粒度特征和空间-时间特征

Method: 设计FAMNet融合模型，包含2D CNN AMNet2D和3D CNN AMNet3D，采用Resnet18共享背骨网络和注意力模块，通过多任务学习（微表情识别+面部动作单元检测）和参数硬共享来提升性能

Result: 在SAMM、CASME II、MMEW数据集上达到83.75%（UAR）和84.03%（UF1）；在极具挑战性的CAS(ME)^3数据集上达到51%（UAR）和43.42%（UF1）

Conclusion: FAMNet通过2D/3D CNN融合和多任务学习策略，能够有效提取微表情的全方位特征，显著提升了微表情识别的性能

Abstract: Micro-expressions recognition (MER) has essential application value in many
fields, but the short duration and low intensity of micro-expressions (MEs)
bring considerable challenges to MER. The current MER methods in deep learning
mainly include three data loading methods: static images, dynamic image
sequence, and a combination of the two streams. How to effectively extract MEs'
fine-grained and spatiotemporal features has been difficult to solve. This
paper proposes a new MER method based on multi-task learning and hierarchical
attention, which fully extracts MEs' omni-directional features by merging 2D
and 3D CNNs. The fusion model consists of a 2D CNN AMNet2D and a 3D CNN
AMNet3D, with similar structures consisting of a shared backbone network
Resnet18 and attention modules. During training, the model adopts different
data loading methods to adapt to two specific networks respectively, jointly
trains on the tasks of MER and facial action unit detection (FAUD), and adopts
the parameter hard sharing for information association, which further improves
the effect of the MER task, and the final fused model is called FAMNet.
Extensive experimental results show that our proposed FAMNet significantly
improves task performance. On the SAMM, CASME II and MMEW datasets, FAMNet
achieves 83.75% (UAR) and 84.03% (UF1). Furthermore, on the challenging
CAS(ME)$^3$ dataset, FAMNet achieves 51% (UAR) and 43.42% (UF1).

Conclusion: CORENet通过跨模态监督成功解决了4D雷达点云稀疏和噪声的问题，为恶劣天气条件下的自动驾驶感知提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: 4D radar-based object detection has garnered great attention for its
robustness in adverse weather conditions and capacity to deliver rich spatial
information across diverse driving scenarios. Nevertheless, the sparse and
noisy nature of 4D radar point clouds poses substantial challenges for
effective perception. To address the limitation, we present CORENet, a novel
cross-modal denoising framework that leverages LiDAR supervision to identify
noise patterns and extract discriminative features from raw 4D radar data.
Designed as a plug-and-play architecture, our solution enables seamless
integration into voxel-based detection frameworks without modifying existing
pipelines. Notably, the proposed method only utilizes LiDAR data for
cross-modal supervision during training while maintaining full radar-only
operation during inference. Extensive evaluation on the challenging Dual-Radar
dataset, which is characterized by elevated noise level, demonstrates the
effectiveness of our framework in enhancing detection robustness. Comprehensive
experiments validate that CORENet achieves superior performance compared to
existing mainstream approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视图聚类中，虽然学习视图间一致性和互补性可以提升性能，但面向聚类的表示学习往往被忽视，需要进一步探索多视图数据的有效表示

Method: 包含三个模块：1）多视图实例学习模块通过重构自编码器和对比学习对齐一致信息并保留私有特征；2）特征和簇的双层解耦增强特征空间和簇空间的区分性；3）一致性学习模块将样本的不同视图及其邻居视为正对，学习聚类分配的一致性并压缩簇内空间

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法相比最先进的SOTA方法具有优越性

Conclusion: BDCL框架通过双层解耦和一致性学习有效提升了多视图聚类的性能，增强了特征表示的簇间区分性和簇内紧凑性

Abstract: Multi-view clustering has shown to be an effective method for analyzing
underlying patterns in multi-view data. The performance of clustering can be
improved by learning the consistency and complementarity between multi-view
features, however, cluster-oriented representation learning is often
overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel Bi-level Decoupling and
Consistency Learning framework (BDCL) to further explore the effective
representation for multi-view data to enhance inter-cluster discriminability
and intra-cluster compactness of features in multi-view clustering. Our
framework comprises three modules: 1) The multi-view instance learning module
aligns the consistent information while preserving the private features between
views through reconstruction autoencoder and contrastive learning. 2) The
bi-level decoupling of features and clusters enhances the discriminability of
feature space and cluster space. 3) The consistency learning module treats the
different views of the sample and their neighbors as positive pairs, learns the
consistency of their clustering assignments, and further compresses the
intra-cluster space. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the SOTA
methods. Our code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/BDCL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HDR技术忽视了快门速度与ISO之间的复杂交互作用，且没有考虑动态场景中的运动模糊效应，导致高ISO产生噪声而长曝光时间引发模糊

Method: 提出AdaptiveAE方法，采用强化学习优化快门速度和ISO组合选择，集成了包含运动模糊和噪声模拟的图像合成流程，利用语义信息和曝光直方图

Result: 在多个数据集上进行实验，证明方法能够根据用户定义的曝光时间预算自适应地选择最优参数序列，达到了目前最优的性能

Conclusion: AdaptiveAE通过考虑动态场景特性和曝光参数之间的复杂交互，提供了更好的曝光策略选择，显著提升了HDR图像重建的质量

Abstract: Mainstream high dynamic range imaging techniques typically rely on fusing
multiple images captured with different exposure setups (shutter speed and
ISO). A good balance between shutter speed and ISO is crucial for achieving
high-quality HDR, as high ISO values introduce significant noise, while long
shutter speeds can lead to noticeable motion blur. However, existing methods
often overlook the complex interaction between shutter speed and ISO and fail
to account for motion blur effects in dynamic scenes.
  In this work, we propose AdaptiveAE, a reinforcement learning-based method
that optimizes the selection of shutter speed and ISO combinations to maximize
HDR reconstruction quality in dynamic environments. AdaptiveAE integrates an
image synthesis pipeline that incorporates motion blur and noise simulation
into our training procedure, leveraging semantic information and exposure
histograms. It can adaptively select optimal ISO and shutter speed sequences
based on a user-defined exposure time budget, and find a better exposure
schedule than traditional solutions. Experimental results across multiple
datasets demonstrate that it achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 因为双打比赛在国际赛事中更普遍，但以前研究主要集中在单打，需要解决数据获取和多人跟踪的挑战

Method: 使用ViT-Pose从ShuttleSet单打数据集提取关键点，通过ST-GCN对比学习框架进行嵌入，采用自定义多目标跟踪算法提高跟踪稳定性，最后用Transformer分类器识别击球动作

Result: 证明了将姿势基于击球识别扩展到双打网球的可行性，扩大了分析能力

Conclusion: 为双打特定数据集的建立奠定了基础，有助于更好理解这种主流但缺乏研究的快速网球比赛形式

Abstract: Badminton is known as one of the fastest racket sports in the world. Despite
doubles matches being more prevalent in international tournaments than singles,
previous research has mainly focused on singles due to the challenges in data
availability and multi-person tracking. To address this gap, we designed an
approach that transfers singles-trained models to doubles analysis. We
extracted keypoints from the ShuttleSet single matches dataset using ViT-Pose
and embedded them through a contrastive learning framework based on ST-GCN. To
improve tracking stability, we incorporated a custom multi-object tracking
algorithm that resolves ID switching issues from fast and overlapping player
movements. A Transformer-based classifier then determines shot occurrences
based on the learned embeddings. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of
extending pose-based shot recognition to doubles badminton, broadening
analytics capabilities. This work establishes a foundation for doubles-specific
datasets to enhance understanding of this predominant yet understudied format
of the fast racket sport.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的视觉标记化器VGQ，通过集成2D高斯分布来改善对几何结构的建模，充分利用位置、旋转和缩放等空间参数，在ImageNet数据集上达到了领先的重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的量化基础标记化器（如VQ-GAN）主要关注外观特征如纹理和颜色，忽略了几何结构，导致对结构化视觉内容的编码不足。

Method: 提出Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ)框架，将传统视觉码本量化与2D高斯分布相结合，通过直接建模位置、旋转、缩放等结构相关参数来编码图像潜变量。增加标记中2D高斯的密度可以提高重建保真度。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256测试中，VGQ达到rFID分数1.00的强劲重建质量。通过增加2D高斯密度，进一步提升到rFID 0.556和PSNR 24.93的领先水平，显著超过现有方法。

Conclusion: VGQ作为一种新的标记化器范式，通过明确增强结构建模能力，有效解决了传统量化方法在结构化视觉信息编码上的不足，为AR图像生成提供了更丰富和结构化的视视编码。

Abstract: The image tokenizer is a critical component in AR image generation, as it
determines how rich and structured visual content is encoded into compact
representations. Existing quantization-based tokenizers such as VQ-GAN
primarily focus on appearance features like texture and color, often neglecting
geometric structures due to their patch-based design. In this work, we explored
how to incorporate more visual information into the tokenizer and proposed a
new framework named Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ), a novel tokenizer
paradigm that explicitly enhances structural modeling by integrating 2D
Gaussians into traditional visual codebook quantization frameworks. Our
approach addresses the inherent limitations of naive quantization methods such
as VQ-GAN, which struggle to model structured visual information due to their
patch-based design and emphasis on texture and color. In contrast, VGQ encodes
image latents as 2D Gaussian distributions, effectively capturing geometric and
spatial structures by directly modeling structure-related parameters such as
position, rotation and scale. We further demonstrate that increasing the
density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens leads to significant gains in
reconstruction fidelity, providing a flexible trade-off between token
efficiency and visual richness. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VGQ achieves
strong reconstruction quality with an rFID score of 1.00. Furthermore, by
increasing the density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens, VGQ gains a
significant boost in reconstruction capability and achieves a state-of-the-art
reconstruction rFID score of 0.556 and a PSNR of 24.93, substantially
outperforming existing methods. Codes will be released soon.

Conclusion: 几何知识引导的分布校准框架能够有效解决数据分布偏差问题，在联邦学习和长尾识别等挑战性场景中展现出优越性能，为基础模型特征的可迁移几何特性提供了实用验证。

Abstract: Despite the fast progress of deep learning, one standing challenge is the gap
of the observed training samples and the underlying true distribution. There
are multiple reasons for the causing of this gap e.g. sampling bias, noise etc.
In the era of foundation models, we show that when leveraging the off-the-shelf
(vision) foundation models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2) for feature extraction, the
geometric shapes of the resulting feature distributions exhibit remarkable
transferability across domains and datasets. To verify its practical
usefulness, we embody our geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
framework in two popular and challenging settings: federated learning and
long-tailed recognition. In the federated setting, we devise a technique of
acquiring the global geometric shape under privacy constraints, then leverage
this knowledge to generate new samples for clients, in the aim of bridging the
gap between local and global observations. In long-tailed learning, it utilizes
the geometric knowledge transferred from sample-rich categories to recover the
true distribution for sample-scarce tail classes. Comprehensive experiments
show that our proposed geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
effectively overcomes information deficits caused by data heterogeneity and
sample imbalance, with boosted performance across benchmarks.

VGG19, ResNet-50, and EfficientNet-B0 on the challenging FER-2013 dataset,
which contains 35,887 low-resolution grayscale images across seven emotion

particularly EfficientNet-B0 (86.44%) and ResNet-50 (85.72%), significantly
outperform VLMs like CLIP (64.07%) and Phi-3.5 Vision (51.66%), highlighting
the limitations of VLMs in low-quality visual tasks. In addition to performance
evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, we provide a

This work underscores the need for adapting VLMs to noisy environments and
provides a reproducible benchmark for future research in emotion recognition.

Conclusion: EAvatar框架通过表惉感知和变形感知的设计，有效解决了3DGS基础头部虚拟人重建中的细粒度表惉捕捉和纹理连续性问题

Abstract: High-fidelity head avatar reconstruction plays a crucial role in AR/VR,
gaming, and multimedia content creation. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated effectiveness in modeling complex geometry
with real-time rendering capability and are now widely used in high-fidelity
head avatar reconstruction tasks. However, existing 3DGS-based methods still
face significant challenges in capturing fine-grained facial expressions and
preserving local texture continuity, especially in highly deformable regions.
To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS-based framework termed
EAvatar for head reconstruction that is both expression-aware and
deformation-aware. Our method introduces a sparse expression control mechanism,
where a small number of key Gaussians are used to influence the deformation of
their neighboring Gaussians, enabling accurate modeling of local deformations
and fine-scale texture transitions. Furthermore, we leverage high-quality 3D
priors from pretrained generative models to provide a more reliable facial
geometry, offering structural guidance that improves convergence stability and
shape accuracy during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method produces more accurate and visually coherent head reconstructions with
improved expression controllability and detail fidelity.

Method: 提出FLAIR方法，包含两个关键创新：1) RC-GAUSS激活函数，在时频不确定性原理约束下实现显式频率选择和空间定位；2) WEGE编码，利用离散小波变换计算能量分数并显式指导频率信息到网络

Result: 在2D图像表示和恢复以及3D重建任务中，该方法持续优于现有INRs

Conclusion: FLAIR通过频率选择和空间定位的创新设计，有效解决了INRs的频谱偏差问题，提升了高频细节的捕捉能力

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) leverage neural networks to map
coordinates to corresponding signals, enabling continuous and compact
representations. This paradigm has driven significant advances in various
vision tasks. However, existing INRs lack frequency selectivity, spatial
localization, and sparse representations, leading to an over-reliance on
redundant signal components. Consequently, they exhibit spectral bias, tending
to learn low-frequency components early while struggling to capture fine
high-frequency details. To address these issues, we propose FLAIR (Frequency-
and Locality-Aware Implicit Neural Representations), which incorporates two key
innovations. The first is RC-GAUSS, a novel activation designed for explicit
frequency selection and spatial localization under the constraints of the
time-frequency uncertainty principle (TFUP). The second is
Wavelet-Energy-Guided Encoding (WEGE), which leverages the discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to compute energy scores and explicitly guide frequency
information to the network. Our method consistently outperforms existing INRs
in 2D image representation and restoration, as well as 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Foveated rendering significantly reduces computational demands in virtual
reality applications by concentrating rendering quality where users focus their
gaze. Current approaches require expensive hardware-based eye tracking systems,
limiting widespread adoption due to cost, calibration complexity, and hardware
compatibility constraints. This paper presents GazeProphet, a software-only
approach for predicting gaze locations in VR environments without requiring
dedicated eye tracking hardware. The approach combines a Spherical Vision
Transformer for processing 360-degree VR scenes with an LSTM-based temporal
encoder that captures gaze sequence patterns. A multi-modal fusion network
integrates spatial scene features with temporal gaze dynamics to predict future
gaze locations with associated confidence estimates. Experimental evaluation on
a comprehensive VR dataset demonstrates that GazeProphet achieves a median
angular error of 3.83 degrees, outperforming traditional saliency-based
baselines by 24% while providing reliable confidence calibration. The approach
maintains consistent performance across different spatial regions and scene
types, enabling practical deployment in VR systems without additional hardware
requirements. Statistical analysis confirms the significance of improvements
across all evaluation metrics. These results show that software-only gaze
prediction can work for VR foveated rendering, making this performance boost
more accessible to different VR platforms and apps.

TL;DR: 轻量化生成式人脸视频编码框架，通过双模式优化（架构重设和操作精细化）实现90.4%参数减少和88.9%计算节省，保持了重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式人脸视频编码（GFVC）虽然在码率夺真性能方面表现优异，但大型模型参数和高计算成本阻碍了其实际部署。

Method: 提出双模式优化方法：1）架构重设-用更薄轻高效的层替换传统3x3卷积；2）两阶段适配性通道剪枝策略-训练时软剪枝识别冗余通道，训练后硬剪枝永久删除。

Result: 实验结果显示，方法实现了90.4%的参数减少和88.9%的计算节省，在感知质量指标上超过最新视频编码标准VVC。

Conclusion: 该方法有望在资源受限环境（如移动边缘设备）中实现高效的GFVC部署。

Abstract: Generative Face Video Coding (GFVC) achieves superior rate-distortion
performance by leveraging the strong inference capabilities of deep generative
models. However, its practical deployment is hindered by large model parameters
and high computational costs. To address this, we propose a lightweight GFVC
framework that introduces dual-mode optimization -- combining architectural
redesign and operational refinement -- to reduce complexity whilst preserving
reconstruction quality. Architecturally, we replace traditional 3 x 3
convolutions with slimmer and more efficient layers, reducing complexity
without compromising feature expressiveness. Operationally, we develop a
two-stage adaptive channel pruning strategy: (1) soft pruning during training
identifies redundant channels via learnable thresholds, and (2) hard pruning
permanently eliminates these channels post-training using a derived mask. This
dual-phase approach ensures both training stability and inference efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed lightweight dual-mode
optimization for GFVC can achieve 90.4% parameter reduction and 88.9%
computation saving compared to the baseline, whilst achieving superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video
Coding (VVC) in terms of perceptual-level quality metrics. As such, the
proposed method is expected to enable efficient GFVC deployment in
resource-constrained environments such as mobile edge devices.

Motivation: 解决SNN因刻度数据信息容量有限而性能较差的问题，避免使用非刻度输入违背神经形态计算初衷

Method: 提出神经元样编码方法，基于生物神经元内在运作原理生成刻度数据，加入人工光感器层使刻度数据包含颜色和亮度信息

Result: 实验结果显示该方法能够有效增加刻度信号的信息含量，提升SNN性能，同时遵循神经形态计算原则

Conclusion: 这种受生物启发的方法有望突破神经形态计算的当前限制，促进SNN的更广泛应用

Abstract: In recent years, neuromorphic computing and spiking neural networks (SNNs)
have ad-vanced rapidly through integration with deep learning. However, the
performance of SNNs still lags behind that of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), primarily due to the limited information capacity of spike-based data.
Although some studies have attempted to improve SNN performance by training
them with non-spiking inputs such as static images, this approach deviates from
the original intent of neuromorphic computing, which emphasizes spike-based
information processing. To address this issue, we propose a Neuron-like
Encoding method that generates spike data based on the intrinsic operational
principles and functions of biological neurons. This method is further enhanced
by the incorporation of an artificial pho-toreceptor layer, enabling spike data
to carry both color and luminance information, thereby forming a complete
visual spike signal. Experimental results using the Integrate-and-Fire neuron
model demonstrate that this biologically inspired approach effectively
increases the information content of spike signals and improves SNN
performance, all while adhering to neuromorphic principles. We believe this
concept holds strong potential for future development and may contribute to
overcoming current limitations in neuro-morphic computing, facilitating broader
applications of SNNs.

TL;DR: DictAS是一个新颖的少样本异常分割框架，通过自监督学习将字典查找能力迁移到未见类别，无需目标数据重新训练，仅使用少量正常参考图像作为视觉提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在少样本异常分割中的跨类别泛化能力严重依赖已知异常样本的先验知识，需要寻求无需重新训练即可检测未见类别异常的方法。

Method: 包含三个核心组件：字典构建（使用正常参考图像特征模拟字典索引和内容）、字典查找（通过稀疏查找策略检索查询特征，无法检索的视为异常）、查询判别正则化（通过对比查询约束和文本对齐约束增强异常判别能力）。

Result: 在七个工业和医学数据集上的广泛实验表明，DictAS始终优于最先进的少样本异常分割方法。

Conclusion: DictAS通过自监督字典查找机制成功实现了对未见类别的异常检测，避免了传统方法对已知异常样本的依赖，展现了优异的跨类别泛化性能。

Abstract: Recent vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have demonstrated remarkable
class-generalizable ability to unseen classes in few-shot anomaly segmentation
(FSAS), leveraging supervised prompt learning or fine-tuning on seen classes.
However, their cross-category generalization largely depends on prior knowledge
of real seen anomaly samples. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,
namely DictAS, which enables a unified model to detect visual anomalies in
unseen object categories without any retraining on the target data, only
employing a few normal reference images as visual prompts. The insight behind
DictAS is to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the FSAS task for
unseen classes via self-supervised learning, instead of merely memorizing the
normal and abnormal feature patterns from the training set. Specifically,
DictAS mainly consists of three components: (1) **Dictionary Construction** -
to simulate the index and content of a real dictionary using features from
normal reference images. (2) **Dictionary Lookup** - to retrieve queried region
features from the dictionary via a sparse lookup strategy. When a query feature
cannot be retrieved, it is classified as an anomaly. (3) **Query Discrimination
Regularization**- to enhance anomaly discrimination by making abnormal features
harder to retrieve from the dictionary. To achieve this, Contrastive Query
Constraint and Text Alignment Constraint are further proposed. Extensive
experiments on seven public industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that
DictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSAS methods.

TL;DR: Learnable SMPLify是一个神经框架，用单次回归模型替代SMPLify的迭代优化过程，实现200倍速度提升，同时保持精度并具有良好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SMPLify作为3D人体姿态和形状估计的基准方法，虽然鲁棒但计算成本高。受其他领域用神经网络替代迭代优化实现显著运行时改进的启发，作者希望开发一个更高效的替代方案。

Method: 提出可学习的SMPLify框架，采用时序采样策略构建初始化-目标对进行训练，使用以人为中心的归一化方案和残差学习来缩小解空间，支持序列推理和插件式后处理。

Result: 方法实现了近200倍的运行时加速，在未见过的3DPW和RICH数据集上泛化良好，作为插件工具在LucidAction上以模型无关方式运行。

Conclusion: Learnable SMPLify建立了一个实用且简单的基准，在保持精度的同时大幅提升效率，具有良好的泛化能力和灵活性。

Abstract: In 3D human pose and shape estimation, SMPLify remains a robust baseline that
solves inverse kinematics (IK) through iterative optimization. However, its
high computational cost limits its practicality. Recent advances across domains
have shown that replacing iterative optimization with data-driven neural
networks can achieve significant runtime improvements without sacrificing
accuracy. Motivated by this trend, we propose Learnable SMPLify, a neural
framework that replaces the iterative fitting process in SMPLify with a
single-pass regression model. The design of our framework targets two core
challenges in neural IK: data construction and generalization. To enable
effective training, we propose a temporal sampling strategy that constructs
initialization-target pairs from sequential frames. To improve generalization
across diverse motions and unseen poses, we propose a human-centric
normalization scheme and residual learning to narrow the solution space.
Learnable SMPLify supports both sequential inference and plug-in
post-processing to refine existing image-based estimators. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method establishes itself as a practical and
simple baseline: it achieves nearly 200x faster runtime compared to SMPLify,
generalizes well to unseen 3DPW and RICH, and operates in a model-agnostic
manner when used as a plug-in tool on LucidAction. The code is available at
https://github.com/Charrrrrlie/Learnable-SMPLify.

Motivation: 现有视频动作分析方法忽视了特征提取中的特征语义，主要关注动作提案优化，导致在自动驾驶等高精度要求的IoT应用中表现不佳。

Method: 提出生成注意力模型，同时学习时间动作特征语义的帧级和片段级依赖关系，充分利用特征语义进行有效特征提取。

Result: 在动作检测和动作识别两个基准视频任务上进行了广泛实验，在公认数据集上验证了方法的优越性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过有效利用特征语义，为高性能IoT应用提供了更鲁棒和可扩展的智能视频分析解决方案。

Abstract: Video action analysis is a foundational technology within the realm of
intelligent video comprehension, particularly concerning its application in
Internet of Things(IoT). However, existing methodologies overlook feature
semantics in feature extraction and focus on optimizing action proposals, thus
these solutions are unsuitable for widespread adoption in high-performance IoT
applications due to the limitations in precision, such as autonomous driving,
which necessitate robust and scalable intelligent video analytics analysis. To
address this issue, we propose a novel generative attention-based model to
learn the relation of feature semantics. Specifically, by leveraging the
differences of actions' foreground and background, our model simultaneously
learns the frame- and segment-dependencies of temporal action feature
semantics, which takes advantage of feature semantics in the feature extraction
effectively. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive
experiments on two benchmark video task, action recognition and action
detection. In the context of action detection tasks, we substantiate the
superiority of our approach through comprehensive validation on widely
recognized datasets. Moreover, we extend the validation of the effectiveness of
our proposed method to a broader task, video action recognition. Our code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 多模态大语言模型在识别图像旋转角度方面存在显著缺陷，特别是无法可靠区分90度和270度旋转，即使通过辅助信息、思维链提示或微调也难以改善。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估多模态大语言模型在识别图像旋转方向方面的视觉推理能力，测试其对空间关系和旋转线索的理解程度。

Method: 构建包含350张图像的RotBench基准测试集，涵盖生活、肖像和风景图像，测试多种先进MLLM模型在不同旋转角度（0°、90°、180°、270°）下的识别能力，并尝试使用辅助信息、思维链提示、多角度同时展示和投票机制等方法提升性能。

Result: 大多数模型能可靠识别正立（0°）图像，部分能识别倒立（180°）图像，但所有模型都无法可靠区分90°和270°旋转。辅助信息和思维链提示仅带来微小且不一致的改进，微调也无法改善90°/270°的区分能力。

Conclusion: MLLM在空间推理能力方面与人类感知存在显著差距，特别是在旋转识别任务上表现出根本性的局限性。

Abstract: We investigate to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can
accurately identify the orientation of input images rotated 0{\deg}, 90{\deg},
180{\deg}, and 270{\deg}. This task demands robust visual reasoning
capabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships
within images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these
abilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark
comprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively
simple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and
proprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably
identify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information
-- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought
prompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate
that most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\deg}) images,
while certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\deg}) images. None
can reliably distinguish between 90{\deg} and 270{\deg}. Simultaneously showing
the image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains
for reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the
performance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve
models' ability to distinguish 90{\deg} and 270{\deg} rotations, despite
substantially improving the identification of 180{\deg} images. Together, these
results reveal a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities
and human perception in identifying rotation.

Motivation: 现有的RVOS方法过度关注特征提取和时序建模，而相对忽视了分割头的设计。实际上，分割头设计仍有很大的改进空间。

Method: 1）创新整合现有分割方法来提升边界分割能力 2）利用文本到视频源生模型进行特征提取，移除传统的噪声预测模块以避免随机性 3）设计时序上下文掩码精细（TCMR）模块来充分利用VAE的特征提取能力

Result: 在四个公开RVOS测试集上均达到了最先进的性能水平

Conclusion: 通过重新关注分割头设计、利用源生模型特征提取以及简洁有效的TCMR模块，本文方法在保持模型简洁性的同时显著提升了分割质量和性能。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment specific objects
in a video according to textual descriptions. We observe that recent RVOS
approaches often place excessive emphasis on feature extraction and temporal
modeling, while relatively neglecting the design of the segmentation head. In
fact, there remains considerable room for improvement in segmentation head
design. To address this, we propose a Temporal-Conditional Referring Video
Object Segmentation model, which innovatively integrates existing segmentation
methods to effectively enhance boundary segmentation capability. Furthermore,
our model leverages a text-to-video diffusion model for feature extraction. On
top of this, we remove the traditional noise prediction module to avoid the
randomness of noise from degrading segmentation accuracy, thereby simplifying
the model while improving performance. Finally, to overcome the limited feature
extraction capability of the VAE, we design a Temporal Context Mask Refinement
(TCMR) module, which significantly improves segmentation quality without
introducing complex designs. We evaluate our method on four public RVOS
benchmarks, where it consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: 汇署式方法能有效生成高质量的恶劣天气图像，显著提升自动驾驶系统在具挑战环境下的识别能力

Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems exhibit markedly degraded performance under
adverse environmental conditions, such as low illumination and precipitation.
The underrepresentation of adverse conditions in AD datasets makes it
challenging to address this deficiency. To circumvent the prohibitive cost of
acquiring and annotating adverse weather data, we propose a novel Domain
Adaptation (DA) pipeline that transforms clear-weather images into fog, rain,
snow, and nighttime images. Here, we systematically develop and evaluate
several novel data-generation pipelines, including simulation-only, GAN-based,
and hybrid diffusion-GAN approaches, to synthesize photorealistic adverse
images from labelled clear images. We leverage an existing DA GAN, extend it to
support auxiliary inputs, and develop a novel training recipe that leverages
both simulated and real images. The simulated images facilitate exact
supervision by providing perfectly matched image pairs, while the real images
help bridge the simulation-to-real (sim2real) gap. We further introduce a
method to mitigate hallucinations and artifacts in Stable-Diffusion
Image-to-Image (img2img) outputs by blending them adaptively with their
progenitor images. We finetune downstream models on our synthetic data and
evaluate them on the Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences (ACDC). We
achieve 1.85 percent overall improvement in semantic segmentation, and 4.62
percent on nighttime, demonstrating the efficacy of our hybrid method for
robust AD perception under challenging conditions.

Motivation: 状态空间模型在计算机视觉中表现出强大能力，但计算效率仍有待提升。现有的token削减方法需要针对SSM的序列建模特性进行专门设计。

Method: 提出MaMe策略：1) 使用状态转移参数Δ作为信息重要性度量指标；2) 引入策略性token排列来保持序列信息流；3) 适用于微调模型和现成模型。

Conclusion: MaMe为SSM在不同应用领域提供了一种有效提升效率的方法，解决了token重要性量化和序列属性保持两个关键挑战。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as powerful architectures in computer
vision, yet improving their computational efficiency remains crucial for
practical and scalable deployment.While token reduction serves as an effective
approach for model efficiency, applying it to SSMs requires careful
consideration of their unique sequential modeling capabilities.In this work, we
propose MaMe, a token-merging strategy tailored for SSM-based vision
models.MaMe addresses two key challenges: quantifying token importance and
preserving sequential properties. Our approach leverages the state transition
parameter $\mathbf{\Delta}$ as an informativeness measure and introduces
strategic token arrangements to preserve sequential information flow.Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MaMe achieves superior efficiency-performance
trade-offs for both fine-tuned and off-the-shelf models. Particularly, our
approach maintains robustness even under aggressive token reduction where
existing methods undergo significant performance degradation.Beyond image
classification, MaMe shows strong generalization capabilities across video and
audio domains, establishing an effective approach for enhancing efficiency in
diverse SSM applications.

Motivation: 解决现有相机基于3D语义场景完成(SSC)方法中，单一编码器同时处理语义和几何先验知识导致的冲突和性能偏抒问题。

Method: 提出双重解耦设计：源级别使用基础编码器分别提供语义特征和立体成本体积，路径级别通过专门化的解耦路径精炼先验知识，使用混合视图变换生成补充性特征，并通过轴向注意融合模块进行各异性融合。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI上较之前最佳方法提升+0.23 mIoU和+2.03 IoU，在SSCBench-KITTI-360上达到状态前沿性能(21.78 mIoU和48.61 IoU)。

Conclusion: FoundationSSC通过双重解耦设计有效解决了语义与几何处理的冲突问题，实现了语义和几何指标的同时显著提升，为自主驾驶提供了更优秀的密集感知能力。

Abstract: Camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) provides dense geometric and
semantic perception for autonomous driving and robotic navigation. However,
existing methods rely on a coupled encoder to deliver both semantic and
geometric priors, which forces the model to make a trade-off between
conflicting demands and limits its overall performance. To tackle these
challenges, we propose FoundationSSC, a novel framework that performs dual
decoupling at both the source and pathway levels. At the source level, we
introduce a foundation encoder that provides rich semantic feature priors for
the semantic branch and high-fidelity stereo cost volumes for the geometric
branch. At the pathway level, these priors are refined through specialised,
decoupled pathways, yielding superior semantic context and depth distributions.
Our dual-decoupling design produces disentangled and refined inputs, which are
then utilised by a hybrid view transformation to generate complementary 3D
features. Additionally, we introduce a novel Axis-Aware Fusion (AAF) module
that addresses the often-overlooked challenge of fusing these features by
anisotropically merging them into a unified representation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the advantages of FoundationSSC, achieving simultaneous
improvements in both semantic and geometric metrics, surpassing prior bests by
+0.23 mIoU and +2.03 IoU on SemanticKITTI. Additionally, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance on SSCBench-KITTI-360, with 21.78 mIoU and 48.61
IoU. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: With the growing demand for short videos and personalized content, automated
Video Log (Vlog) generation has become a key direction in multimodal content
creation. Existing methods mostly rely on predefined scripts, lacking dynamism
and personal expression. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an automated
Vlog generation approach that enables effective multimodal collaboration and
high personalization. To this end, we propose PersonaVlog, an automated
multimodal stylized Vlog generation framework that can produce personalized
Vlogs featuring videos, background music, and inner monologue speech based on a
given theme and reference image. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent
collaboration framework based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This
framework efficiently generates high-quality prompts for multimodal content
creation based on user input, thereby improving the efficiency and creativity
of the process. In addition, we incorporate a feedback and rollback mechanism
that leverages MLLMs to evaluate and provide feedback on generated results,
thereby enabling iterative self-correction of multimodal content. We also
propose ThemeVlogEval, a theme-based automated benchmarking framework that
provides standardized metrics and datasets for fair evaluation. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the significant advantages and potential of our
framework over several baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and great

Abstract: Face mask detection has become increasingly important recently, particularly
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many face detection models have been developed in
smart entryways using IoT. However, there is a lack of IoT development on face
mask detection. This paper proposes a two-factor authentication system for
smart entryway access control using facial recognition and passcode
verification and an automation process to alert the owner and activate the
surveillance system when a stranger is detected and controls the system
remotely via Telegram on a Raspberry Pi platform. The system employs the Local
Binary Patterns Histograms for the full face recognition algorithm and modified
LBPH algorithm for occluded face detection. On average, the system achieved an
Accuracy of approximately 70%, a Precision of approximately 80%, and a Recall
of approximately 83.26% across all tested users. The results indicate that the
system is capable of conducting face recognition and mask detection, automating
the operation of the remote control to register users, locking or unlocking the
door, and notifying the owner. The sample participants highly accept it for
future use in the user acceptance test.

TL;DR: TalkVid是一个新的大规模、高质量、多样化音频驱动说话头合成数据集，包含1244小时视频和7729个独特说话人，解决了现有模型在种族、语言和年龄群体多样性方面泛化能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频驱动说话头合成模型在人类多样性（种族、语言、年龄）方面泛化能力不足，主要原因是训练数据在规模、质量和多样性方面存在局限性。

Method: 通过多阶段自动化流程精心筛选运动稳定性、美学质量和面部细节，构建TalkVid数据集，并创建TalkVid-Bench分层评估集（500个片段），在关键人口统计和语言维度上保持平衡。

Result: 在TalkVid上训练的模型优于在先前数据集上训练的模型，表现出更好的跨数据集泛化能力。TalkVid-Bench分析揭示了传统聚合指标掩盖的性能差异。

Conclusion: TalkVid数据集和TalkVid-Bench评估集为解决音频驱动说话头合成中的多样性泛化问题提供了重要资源，强调了在评估中考虑人口统计平衡的必要性。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head synthesis has achieved remarkable photorealism, yet
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models exhibit a critical failure: they lack
generalization to the full spectrum of human diversity in ethnicity, language,
and age groups. We argue that this generalization gap is a direct symptom of
limitations in existing training data, which lack the necessary scale, quality,
and diversity. To address this challenge, we introduce TalkVid, a new
large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset containing 1244 hours of video
from 7729 unique speakers. TalkVid is curated through a principled, multi-stage
automated pipeline that rigorously filters for motion stability, aesthetic
quality, and facial detail, and is validated against human judgments to ensure
its reliability. Furthermore, we construct and release TalkVid-Bench, a
stratified evaluation set of 500 clips meticulously balanced across key
demographic and linguistic axes. Our experiments demonstrate that a model
trained on TalkVid outperforms counterparts trained on previous datasets,
exhibiting superior cross-dataset generalization. Crucially, our analysis on
TalkVid-Bench reveals performance disparities across subgroups that are
obscured by traditional aggregate metrics, underscoring its necessity for
future research. Code and data can be found in

Motivation: 解决当前RGB-D方法在缺乏深度信息的场景中面临的挑战，提供一种仅依赖RGB图像的类别级物体姿势估计方案

Method: 设计基于Transformer的神经网络用于预测和融合目标物体的几何特征，引入几何特征导向算法以确保特征准确描绘对象几何结构，最终使用RANSAC-PnP算法解决变化尺度问题并计算姿势

Result: 在标准数据集上的实验结果显示，该方法不仅高效而且在准确性上超过了之前的RGB基础方法

Conclusion: 该方法为使用RGB图像推进类别级物体姿势估计提供了新的视角，在实际应用场景中具有重要价值

Abstract: While most current RGB-D-based category-level object pose estimation methods
achieve strong performance, they face significant challenges in scenes lacking
depth information. In this paper, we propose a novel category-level object pose
estimation approach that relies solely on RGB images. This method enables
accurate pose estimation in real-world scenarios without the need for depth
data. Specifically, we design a transformer-based neural network for
category-level object pose estimation, where the transformer is employed to
predict and fuse the geometric features of the target object. To ensure that
these predicted geometric features faithfully capture the object's geometry, we
introduce a geometric feature-guided algorithm, which enhances the network's
ability to effectively represent the object's geometric information. Finally,
we utilize the RANSAC-PnP algorithm to compute the object's pose, addressing
the challenges associated with variable object scales in pose estimation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach is not
only highly efficient but also achieves superior accuracy compared to previous
RGB-based methods. These promising results offer a new perspective for
advancing category-level object pose estimation using RGB images.

Motivation: 扩散模型在条件生成中对引导权重选择高度敏感，存在训练和推理阶段的差距，这影响了生成样本的质量和性能

Method: 提出DiffIER方法，在推理阶段通过迭代误差最小化来减少累积误差，采用基于优化的插拔式框架

Conclusion: DiffIER方法有效缓解了训练-推理差距问题，提高了生成质量，具有广泛的适用性和应用潜力

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality samples and enhancing performance across diverse domains through
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, the quality of generated samples is
highly sensitive to the selection of the guidance weight. In this work, we
identify a critical ``training-inference gap'' and we argue that it is the
presence of this gap that undermines the performance of conditional generation
and renders outputs highly sensitive to the guidance weight. We quantify this
gap by measuring the accumulated error during the inference stage and establish
a correlation between the selection of guidance weight and minimizing this gap.
Furthermore, to mitigate this gap, we propose DiffIER, an optimization-based
method for high-quality generation. We demonstrate that the accumulated error
can be effectively reduced by an iterative error minimization at each step
during inference. By introducing this novel plug-and-play optimization
framework, we enable the optimization of errors at every single inference step
and enhance generation quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed
method outperforms baseline approaches in conditional generation tasks.
Furthermore, the method achieves consistent success in text-to-image
generation, image super-resolution, and text-to-speech generation, underscoring
its versatility and potential for broad applications in future research.

Motivation: 现有虚拟试穿方法主要关注服装，缺乏对其他可穿戴物品的支持，且数据配对困难限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用两阶段训练流程：第一阶段利用大规模无配对图像训练无掩码定位模型；第二阶段用少量配对图像微调以保持物品外观一致性。

Conclusion: OmniTry提供了一个实用的统一框架，能够处理各类可穿戴物品的虚拟试穿，解决了数据配对难题并实现了优异的性能。

Abstract: Virtual Try-ON (VTON) is a practical and widely-applied task, for which most
of existing works focus on clothes. This paper presents OmniTry, a unified
framework that extends VTON beyond garment to encompass any wearable objects,
e.g., jewelries and accessories, with mask-free setting for more practical
application. When extending to various types of objects, data curation is
challenging for obtaining paired images, i.e., the object image and the
corresponding try-on result. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-staged
pipeline: For the first stage, we leverage large-scale unpaired images, i.e.,
portraits with any wearable items, to train the model for mask-free
localization. Specifically, we repurpose the inpainting model to automatically
draw objects in suitable positions given an empty mask. For the second stage,
the model is further fine-tuned with paired images to transfer the consistency
of object appearance. We observed that the model after the first stage shows
quick convergence even with few paired samples. OmniTry is evaluated on a
comprehensive benchmark consisting of 12 common classes of wearable objects,
with both in-shop and in-the-wild images. Experimental results suggest that
OmniTry shows better performance on both object localization and
ID-preservation compared with existing methods. The code, model weights, and
evaluation benchmark of OmniTry will be made publicly available at

Motivation: 解决从遥感图像中自动提取完整精确道路网络图的挑战：分割方法缺乏拓扑保真度，图增长方法计算成本高，图生成方法无法动态插入顶点。

Method: 提出DeH4R混合模型，将任务解耦为四个步骤：候选顶点检测、相邻顶点预测、初始图构建和图扩展。这种架构设计既保留了图生成方法的高效率，又继承了图增长方法的动态性。

Result: 在CityScale和SpaceNet标准数据集上达到了最先进性能，在CityScale上比之前最佳图增长方法RNGDet++提升了4.62 APLS和10.18 IoU，速度提升约10倍。

Conclusion: DeH4R通过创新的混合架构，成功结合了图生成方法的高效率和图增长方法的动态性优势，为道路网络提取领域提供了一种既高效又准确的解决方案。

Abstract: The automated extraction of complete and precise road network graphs from
remote sensing imagery remains a critical challenge in geospatial computer
vision. Segmentation-based approaches, while effective in pixel-level
recognition, struggle to maintain topology fidelity after vectorization
postprocessing. Graph-growing methods build more topologically faithful graphs
but suffer from computationally prohibitive iterative ROI cropping.
Graph-generating methods first predict global static candidate road network
vertices, and then infer possible edges between vertices. They achieve fast
topology-aware inference, but limits the dynamic insertion of vertices. To
address these challenges, we propose DeH4R, a novel hybrid model that combines
graph-generating efficiency and graph-growing dynamics. This is achieved by
decoupling the task into candidate vertex detection, adjacent vertex
prediction, initial graph contruction, and graph expansion. This architectural
innovation enables dynamic vertex (edge) insertions while retaining fast
inference speed and enhancing both topology fidelity and spatial consistency.
Comprehensive evaluations on CityScale and SpaceNet benchmarks demonstrate
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. DeH4R outperforms the prior SOTA
graph-growing method RNGDet++ by 4.62 APLS and 10.18 IoU on CityScale, while
being approximately 10 $\times$ faster. The code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/7777777FAN/DeH4R.

TL;DR: HumanPCR是一个评估多模态大模型在人类相关视觉上下文理解能力的三层次评估套件，包含感知、理解和推理三个层级，包含6000+人工验证问题和视频推理测试，评估发现现有模型在人类中心视觉理解方面存在显著挑战

Motivation: 随着多模态模型的快速发展，追求人工通用智能需要模型在多样化环境中达到人类可比性能，现有基准测试经常忽视人类相关视觉理解的关键技能

Method: 提出HumanPCR评估套件，包含三个层次：Human-P（感知）、Human-C（理解）和Human-R（推理）。前两者包含6000+人工验证多选题，评估9个维度的任务；后者提供手动策划的视频推理测试，需要整合多视觉证据和主动提取上下文

Result: 对30多个最先进模型的广泛评估显示，在以人为中心的视觉理解方面存在显著挑战，特别是在详细空间感知、时间理解和心智建模任务中。模型在从多样化人类场景中提取主动视觉证据方面表现挣扎，过度依赖查询引导检索

Conclusion: 即使采用扩展视觉上下文和测试时思考等先进技术，改进效果有限。HumanPCR和发现将推动多模态模型的开发、评估和以人为中心的应用发展

Abstract: The aspiration for artificial general intelligence, fueled by the rapid
progress of multimodal models, demands human-comparable performance across
diverse environments. We propose HumanPCR, an evaluation suite for probing
MLLMs' capacity about human-related visual contexts across three hierarchical
levels: Perception, Comprehension, and Reasoning (denoted by Human-P, Human-C,
and Human-R, respectively). Human-P and Human-C feature over 6,000
human-verified multiple choice questions, assessing massive tasks of 9
dimensions, including but not limited to essential skills frequently overlooked
by existing benchmarks. Human-R offers a challenging manually curated video
reasoning test that requires integrating multiple visual evidences, proactively
extracting context beyond question cues, and applying human-like expertise.
Each question includes human-annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales with
key visual evidence to support further research. Extensive evaluations on over
30 state-of-the-art models exhibit significant challenges in human-centric
visual understanding, particularly in tasks involving detailed space
perception, temporal understanding, and mind modeling. Moreover, analysis of
Human-R reveals the struggle of models in extracting essential proactive visual
evidence from diverse human scenes and their faulty reliance on query-guided
retrieval. Even with advanced techniques like scaling visual contexts and
test-time thinking yield only limited benefits. We hope HumanPCR and our
findings will advance the development, evaluation, and human-centric
application of multimodal models.

Motivation: 医学图像分割标注数据获取成本高、耗时，需要半监督学习技术来利用未标注数据。Mamba等状态空间模型在长程依赖关系处理方面表现优异，需要探索其在医学图像分割中的潜力

Method: 提出DCMamba框架：1)数据层面：基于Mamba扫描特性的片层弱-强混合增帿；2)网络层面：多样扫描协作模块，利用不同扫描方向的预测差异；3)特征层面：不确定性加权对比学习机制增强特征表示多样性

Conclusion: DCMamba框架通过多角度增强多样性的方法，有效提升了半监督医学图像分割的性能，证明了Mamba模型在该领域的潜力与价值

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality annotated data for medical image segmentation is
tedious and costly. Semi-supervised segmentation techniques alleviate this
burden by leveraging unlabeled data to generate pseudo labels. Recently,
advanced state space models, represented by Mamba, have shown efficient
handling of long-range dependencies. This drives us to explore their potential
in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a
novel Diversity-enhanced Collaborative Mamba framework (namely DCMamba) for
semi-supervised medical image segmentation, which explores and utilizes the
diversity from data, network, and feature perspectives. Firstly, from the data
perspective, we develop patch-level weak-strong mixing augmentation with
Mamba's scanning modeling characteristics. Moreover, from the network
perspective, we introduce a diverse-scan collaboration module, which could
benefit from the prediction discrepancies arising from different scanning
directions. Furthermore, from the feature perspective, we adopt an
uncertainty-weighted contrastive learning mechanism to enhance the diversity of
feature representation. Experiments demonstrate that our DCMamba significantly
outperforms other semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods, e.g.,
yielding the latest SSM-based method by 6.69% on the Synapse dataset with 20%
labeled data.

Abstract: Every day, a large amount of educational content is uploaded online across
different areas, including agriculture and gardening. When these videos or
materials are grouped meaningfully, they can make learning easier and more
effective. One promising way to organize and enrich such content is through the
Metaverse, which allows users to explore educational experiences in an
interactive and immersive environment. However, searching for relevant
Metaverse scenarios and finding those matching users' interests remains a
challenging task. A first step in this direction has been done recently, but
existing datasets are small and not sufficient for training advanced models. In
this work, we make two main contributions: first, we introduce a new dataset
containing 457 agricultural-themed virtual museums (AgriMuseums), each enriched
with textual descriptions; and second, we propose a hierarchical
vision-language model to represent and retrieve relevant AgriMuseums using
natural language queries. In our experimental setting, the proposed method
achieves up to about 62\% R@1 and 78\% MRR, confirming its effectiveness, and
it also leads to improvements on existing benchmarks by up to 6\% R@1 and 11\%
MRR. Moreover, an extensive evaluation validates our design choices. Code and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法在图像扰动时仅最大化全局相似度，忽略了投影器模块这一关键语义桥梁，限制了攻击的细粒度效果和整体有效性。

Method: 提出Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA)，利用Q-Former中间阶段将全局图像嵌入转换为细粒度视觉特征，结合Residual Query Alignment (RQA)保护无关视觉内容。

Result: 在标准全局图像描述任务和细粒度视觉问答任务中一致优于现有方法，并能成功迁移到Google Gemini和OpenAI GPT等商业VLM模型。

Conclusion: IPGA通过攻击投影器模块中间阶段实现了更精确的对抗控制，提高了攻击效果和跨模型迁移能力，为VLM安全评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Targeted adversarial attacks are essential for proactively identifying
security flaws in Vision-Language Models before real-world deployment. However,
current methods perturb images to maximize global similarity with the target
text or reference image at the encoder level, collapsing rich visual semantics
into a single global vector. This limits attack granularity, hindering
fine-grained manipulations such as modifying a car while preserving its
background. Furthermore, these methods largely overlook the projector module, a
critical semantic bridge between the visual encoder and the language model in
VLMs, thereby failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline
within VLMs and limiting attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), the first method to
attack using the intermediate stage of the projector module, specifically the
widely adopted Q-Former, which transforms global image embeddings into
fine-grained visual features. This enables more precise control over
adversarial perturbations by operating on semantically meaningful visual tokens
rather than a single global representation. Specifically, IPGA leverages the
Q-Former pretrained solely on the first vision-language alignment stage,
without LLM fine-tuning, which improves both attack effectiveness and
transferability across diverse VLMs. Furthermore, we propose Residual Query
Alignment (RQA) to preserve unrelated visual content, thereby yielding more
controlled and precise adversarial manipulations. Extensive experiments show
that our attack method consistently outperforms existing methods in both
standard global image captioning tasks and fine-grained visual
question-answering tasks in black-box environment. Additionally, IPGA
successfully transfers to multiple commercial VLMs, including Google Gemini and
OpenAI GPT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在单图像任务上表现良好，但在处理多图像输入时性能显著下降，因为不同图像的视觉线索在模型输出中相互干扰，存在跨图像信息泄露问题

Method: 提出FOCUS解码策略：1）顺序用随机噪声掩码除一张图像外的所有图像；2）重复此过程获得部分掩码上下文下的logits；3）聚合logits并使用纯噪声参考输入进行对比优化，抑制信息泄露

Result: FOCUS在四个多图像基准测试和多种LVLM模型家族中一致提升性能，证明其通用性和实用性

Conclusion: FOCUS提供了一种无需额外训练或架构修改的通用实用解决方案，可有效增强多图像推理能力

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong performance on
single-image tasks. However, we observe that their performance degrades
significantly when handling multi-image inputs. This occurs because visual cues
from different images become entangled in the model's output. We refer to this
phenomenon as cross-image information leakage. To address this issue, we
propose FOCUS, a training-free and architecture-agnostic decoding strategy that
mitigates cross-image information leakage during inference. FOCUS sequentially
masks all but one image with random noise, guiding the model to focus on the
single clean image. We repeat this process across all target images to obtain
logits under partially masked contexts. These logits are aggregated and then
contrastively refined using a noise-only reference input, which suppresses the
leakage and yields more accurate outputs. FOCUS consistently improves
performance across four multi-image benchmarks and diverse LVLM families. This
demonstrates that FOCUS offers a general and practical solution for enhancing
multi-image reasoning without additional training or architectural
modifications.

Method: 构建包含92个真实场景、16个独特物体的MR6D数据集，涵盖静态和动态交互场景，专门捕捉移动平台特有的远距离视角、多样化物体配置、大尺寸物体和复杂遮挡模式。

Result: 初步实验显示当前6D位姿估计流程在这些设置下表现不佳，2D分割成为另一个主要障碍，表明现有方法在移动机器人场景中存在明显局限性。

Conclusion: MR6D为开发和评估专门针对移动机器人需求的位姿估计方法奠定了基础，填补了该领域的数据空白，数据集已公开可用。

Abstract: Existing 6D pose estimation datasets primarily focus on small household
objects typically handled by robot arm manipulators, limiting their relevance
to mobile robotics. Mobile platforms often operate without manipulators,
interact with larger objects, and face challenges such as long-range
perception, heavy self-occlusion, and diverse camera perspectives. While recent
models generalize well to unseen objects, evaluations remain confined to
household-like settings that overlook these factors. We introduce MR6D, a
dataset designed for 6D pose estimation for mobile robots in industrial
environments. It includes 92 real-world scenes featuring 16 unique objects
across static and dynamic interactions. MR6D captures the challenges specific
to mobile platforms, including distant viewpoints, varied object
configurations, larger object sizes, and complex occlusion/self-occlusion
patterns. Initial experiments reveal that current 6D pipelines underperform in
these settings, with 2D segmentation being another hurdle. MR6D establishes a
foundation for developing and evaluating pose estimation methods tailored to
the demands of mobile robotics. The dataset is available at

Abstract: This article presents a new method for non-rigidly registering a 3D shape to
2D keypoints observed by a constellation of multiple cameras. Non-rigid
registration of a 3D shape to observed 2D keypoints, i.e., Shape-from-Template
(SfT), has been widely studied using single images, but SfT with information
from multiple-cameras jointly opens new directions for extending the scope of
known use-cases such as 3D shape registration in medical imaging and
registration from hand-held cameras, to name a few. We represent such
multi-camera setup with the generalised camera model; therefore any collection
of perspective or orthographic cameras observing any deforming object can be
registered. We propose multiple approaches for such SfT: the first approach
where the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from a known 3D
point in space, the second approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a
direction vector from an unknown 3D point in space but with known orientation
w.r.t some local reference frame, and a third approach where, apart from
correspondences, the silhouette of the imaged object is also known. Together,
these form the first set of solutions to the SfT problem with generalised
cameras. The key idea behind SfT with generalised camera is the improved
reconstruction accuracy from estimating deformed shape while utilising the
additional information from the mutual constraints between multiple views of a
deformed object. The correspondence-based approaches are solved with convex
programming while the silhouette-based approach is an iterative refinement of
the results from the convex solutions. We demonstrate the accuracy of our
proposed methods on many synthetic and real data

TL;DR: VisionLaw是一个双层优化框架，通过视觉观察推断可解释的内在动力学表达式，使用LLM作为物理专家生成和修订本构定律，并通过视觉模拟评估一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在从视觉观察推断物体内在动力学时面临两个主要挑战：依赖手动定义的本构先验难以泛化到复杂场景，或使用神经网络导致可解释性差和泛化能力有限。

Method: 提出双层优化框架：上层使用LLM驱动的解耦本构演化策略，LLM作为物理专家生成和修订本构定律；下层使用视觉引导的本构评估机制，通过视觉模拟评估生成定律与内在动力学的一致性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，VisionLaw能有效从视觉观察推断可解释的内在动力学，显著优于现有最先进方法，并在新场景的交互模拟中表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: VisionLaw框架成功解决了现有方法的局限性，通过结合LLM的物理知识和视觉模拟验证，实现了从视觉观察中推断可解释且泛化能力强的内在动力学表达式。

Abstract: The intrinsic dynamics of an object governs its physical behavior in the real
world, playing a critical role in enabling physically plausible interactive
simulation with 3D assets. Existing methods have attempted to infer the
intrinsic dynamics of objects from visual observations, but generally face two
major challenges: one line of work relies on manually defined constitutive
priors, making it difficult to generalize to complex scenarios; the other
models intrinsic dynamics using neural networks, resulting in limited
interpretability and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we
propose VisionLaw, a bilevel optimization framework that infers interpretable
expressions of intrinsic dynamics from visual observations. At the upper level,
we introduce an LLMs-driven decoupled constitutive evolution strategy, where
LLMs are prompted as a knowledgeable physics expert to generate and revise
constitutive laws, with a built-in decoupling mechanism that substantially
reduces the search complexity of LLMs. At the lower level, we introduce a
vision-guided constitutive evaluation mechanism, which utilizes visual
simulation to evaluate the consistency between the generated constitutive law
and the underlying intrinsic dynamics, thereby guiding the upper-level
evolution. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that VisionLaw can effectively infer interpretable intrinsic dynamics from
visual observations. It significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods and exhibits strong generalization for interactive simulation in novel
scenarios.

Motivation: 提高乳腺癌超声分割的性能和可解释性，通过整合临床文本信息来增强模型的透明度和可信度。

Method: 使用双分支视觉编码器（ViT+Swin Transformer）和不确定性感知融合，结合BioClinicalBERT编码临床语言，通过跨模态注意力融合多模态特征。

Abstract: We introduce Med-CTX, a fully transformer based multimodal framework for
explainable breast cancer ultrasound segmentation. We integrate clinical
radiology reports to boost both performance and interpretability. Med-CTX
achieves exact lesion delineation by using a dual-branch visual encoder that
combines ViT and Swin transformers, as well as uncertainty aware fusion.
Clinical language structured with BI-RADS semantics is encoded by
BioClinicalBERT and combined with visual features utilising cross-modal
attention, allowing the model to provide clinically grounded, model generated
explanations. Our methodology generates segmentation masks, uncertainty maps,
and diagnostic rationales all at once, increasing confidence and transparency
in computer assisted diagnosis. On the BUS-BRA dataset, Med-CTX achieves a Dice
score of 99% and an IoU of 95%, beating existing baselines U-Net, ViT, and
Swin. Clinical text plays a key role in segmentation accuracy and explanation
quality, as evidenced by ablation studies that show a -5.4% decline in Dice
score and -31% in CIDEr. Med-CTX achieves good multimodal alignment (CLIP
score: 85%) and increased confi dence calibration (ECE: 3.2%), setting a new
bar for trustworthy, multimodal medical architecture.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了TCA（时间步压缩攻击）框架，通过时间步级反向传播和对抗性膜电位重用技术，显著降低SNN对抗攻击的延迟达56%以上，同时保持攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于梯度的SNN对抗攻击方法存在严重的攻击延迟问题，这些方法直接扩展ANN范式，未能充分利用SNN的关键特性，导致多时间步处理产生大量延迟，不适用于实时应用。

Method: TCA框架包含两个核心组件：1) 时间步级反向传播(TLBP) - 发现全局时间信息对攻击成功并非关键，支持按时间步评估和提前停止；2) 对抗性膜电位重用(A-MPR) - 利用初始时间步膜电位积累的预热特性，可预计算和重用。

Result: 在VGG-11和ResNet-17模型上，使用CIFAR-10/100和CIFAR10-DVS数据集的实验表明，TCA在白盒和黑盒设置下分别减少攻击延迟56.6%和57.1%，同时保持可比的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: TCA通过有效利用SNN的时间动态特性，显著降低了对抗攻击的计算延迟，为SNN在实际实时应用中的安全部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based adversarial attacks on spiking neural
networks (SNNs), which largely rely on extending FGSM and PGD frameworks, face
a critical limitation: substantial attack latency from multi-timestep
processing, rendering them infeasible for practical real-time applications.
This inefficiency stems from their design as direct extensions of ANN
paradigms, which fail to exploit key SNN properties. In this paper, we propose
the timestep-compressed attack (TCA), a novel framework that significantly
reduces attack latency. TCA introduces two components founded on key insights
into SNN behavior. First, timestep-level backpropagation (TLBP) is based on our
finding that global temporal information in backpropagation to generate
perturbations is not critical for an attack's success, enabling per-timestep
evaluation for early stopping. Second, adversarial membrane potential reuse
(A-MPR) is motivated by the observation that initial timesteps are
inefficiently spent accumulating membrane potential, a warm-up phase that can
be pre-calculated and reused. Our experiments on VGG-11 and ResNet-17 with the
CIFAR-10/100 and CIFAR10-DVS datasets show that TCA significantly reduces the
required attack latency by up to 56.6% and 57.1% compared to SOTA methods in
white-box and black-box settings, respectively, while maintaining a comparable
attack success rate.

TL;DR: 无监督聚类框架结合街道级图像和空间植装模式，无需标签数据即可估算城市树木生物多样性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市树木生物多样性对气候适应和生态稳定至关重要，但传统量丰方法成本高、耗时，而有监督AI方法需要标签数据且跨区域通用性差

Method: 无监督聚类框架，整合街道级图像的视觉嵌入表征和空间植装模式，在无标签数据的情况下估算生物多样性

Result: 在8个北美城市应用，方法能高保真度恢复属级多样性模式，对Shannon和Simpson指数获得低Wasserstein距离，保持空间自相关性

Conclusion: 该可扩展、细粒度方法能够在缺乏详细量丰的城市进行生物多样性制图，为供给公平绿化访问和城市生态系统适应性管理提供低成本、连续监测的途径

Abstract: Urban tree biodiversity is critical for climate resilience, ecological
stability, and livability in cities, yet most municipalities lack detailed
knowledge of their canopies. Field-based inventories provide reliable estimates
of Shannon and Simpson diversity but are costly and time-consuming, while
supervised AI methods require labeled data that often fail to generalize across
regions. We introduce an unsupervised clustering framework that integrates
visual embeddings from street-level imagery with spatial planting patterns to
estimate biodiversity without labels. Applied to eight North American cities,
the method recovers genus-level diversity patterns with high fidelity,
achieving low Wasserstein distances to ground truth for Shannon and Simpson
indices and preserving spatial autocorrelation. This scalable, fine-grained
approach enables biodiversity mapping in cities lacking detailed inventories
and offers a pathway for continuous, low-cost monitoring to support equitable
access to greenery and adaptive management of urban ecosystems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能交通检测在跨域场景中面临重大挑战，需要解决域间差异导致的性能下降问题

Method: 使用关注基对齐模块进行图像级特征对齐，重新加权频道重要性，通过区域建议网络获取显著区域特征，并使用实例-图像级对齐模块缓解域间差距

Result: 在流行的跨域物体检测测试集上进行了大量实验，结果显示SA3方法超越了之前的最先进方法

Conclusion: SA3方法通过效率高的对齐机制和识别策略，能够有效提升跨域普通物体检测的性能，为智能交通检测领域提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Achieving top-notch performance in Intelligent Transportation detection is a
critical research area. However, many challenges still need to be addressed
when it comes to detecting in a cross-domain scenario. In this paper, we
propose a Self-Aware Adaptive Alignment (SA3), by leveraging an efficient
alignment mechanism and recognition strategy. Our proposed method employs a
specified attention-based alignment module trained on source and target domain
datasets to guide the image-level features alignment process, enabling the
local-global adaptive alignment between the source domain and target domain.
Features from both domains, whose channel importance is re-weighted, are fed
into the region proposal network, which facilitates the acquisition of salient
region features. Also, we introduce an instance-to-image level alignment module
specific to the target domain to adaptively mitigate the domain gap. To
evaluate the proposed method, extensive experiments have been conducted on
popular cross-domain object detection benchmarks. Experimental results show
that SA3 achieves superior results to the previous state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在视觉效果上表现优异，但经常无法精确对齐文本提示，导致缺失关键元素或不应该混合的概念

Method: 学习来自目标提示的高成功率分布，在去噪过程中显式建模信号组件，提供细粒度控制，无需训练且支持去噪和流匹配架构，同时支持附加条件如盒子

Result: 实验结果显示该方法在性能上超过了当前最先进的方法

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成更准确对齐文本提示的图像，提供了优雅的解决方案来改善文本到图像生成的谨完性

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models produce visually impressive results but
often struggle with precise alignment to text prompts, leading to missing
critical elements or unintended blending of distinct concepts. We propose a
novel approach that learns a high-success-rate distribution conditioned on a
target prompt, ensuring that generated images faithfully reflect the
corresponding prompts. Our method explicitly models the signal component during
the denoising process, offering fine-grained control that mitigates
over-optimization and out-of-distribution artifacts. Moreover, our framework is
training-free and seamlessly integrates with both existing diffusion and flow
matching architectures. It also supports additional conditioning modalities --
such as bounding boxes -- for enhanced spatial alignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统石材劣化模式识别依赖专家团队直接观察，虽然准确但耗时耗力，需要开发更高效的自动化诊断系统。

Method: 基于认知架构构建多智能体AI系统，包含5个专业代理：岩相学家、病理学家、环境专家、修复师和诊断协调员，协同工作分析视觉证据。

Result: 在28个包含多重劣化模式的困难图像测试中，系统在所有指标上都显示出相比基础模型的巨大提升。

Conclusion: 多智能体AI系统能够有效模拟专家协作，自动化石材病理诊断，显著提高识别效率和准确性。

Abstract: The Id-Pattern system within the RED.AI project (Reabilita\c{c}\~ao
Estrutural Digital atrav\'es da AI) consists of an agentic system designed to
assist in the identification of stone deterioration patterns. Traditional
methodologies, based on direct observation by expert teams, are accurate but
costly in terms of time and resources. The system developed here introduces and
evaluates a multi-agent artificial intelligence (AI) system, designed to
simulate collaboration between experts and automate the diagnosis of stone
pathologies from visual evidence. The approach is based on a cognitive
architecture that orchestrates a team of specialized AI agents which, in this
specific case, are limited to five: a lithologist, a pathologist, an
environmental expert, a conservator-restorer, and a diagnostic coordinator. To
evaluate the system we selected 28 difficult images involving multiple
deterioration patterns. Our first results showed a huge boost on all metrics of
our system compared to the foundational model.

*Matthias Neuwirth-Trapp,Maarten Bieshaar,Danda Pani Paudel,Luc Van Gool*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出两个现实性增量学习目标检测基准(RICO)，替代传统合成测试集，发现所有IL方法在适应性和知识保留方面都表现较差，简单回放小量旧数据即可超过所有方法，但仍不及单独训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有增量学习评估多使用合成简化的测试集，影蕴了IL方法在现实场景下的真实性能。需要更现实的测试基准来更准确评估IL方法的性能。

Method: 构建了两个现实性增量学习目标检测基准(RICO)：D-RICO(域转移，固定类别集)和EC-RICO(扩展类别，每步增加新域和新类别)，基于14个多样化数据集包含真实和合成域、多种条件(天气、时间)、相机传感器、视角和标注策略。

Result: 所有IL方法在适应性和知识保留方面都表现较差；简单回放小量旧数据即可超过所有IL方法；但单独训练仍是最优解。

Conclusion: 现有IL方法在现实场景下存在显著性能差距，应归因于弱化的蓬泽教师、单模型无法处理多样任务以及可塑性不足。需要更有效的方法来应对现实增量学习挑战。

Abstract: Incremental Learning (IL) trains models sequentially on new data without full
retraining, offering privacy, efficiency, and scalability. IL must balance
adaptability to new data with retention of old knowledge. However, evaluations
often rely on synthetic, simplified benchmarks, obscuring real-world IL
performance. To address this, we introduce two Realistic Incremental Object
Detection Benchmarks (RICO): Domain RICO (D-RICO) features domain shifts with a
fixed class set, and Expanding-Classes RICO (EC-RICO) integrates new domains
and classes per IL step. Built from 14 diverse datasets covering real and
synthetic domains, varying conditions (e.g., weather, time of day), camera
sensors, perspectives, and labeling policies, both benchmarks capture
challenges absent in existing evaluations. Our experiments show that all IL
methods underperform in adaptability and retention, while replaying a small
amount of previous data already outperforms all methods. However, individual
training on the data remains superior. We heuristically attribute this gap to
weak teachers in distillation, single models' inability to manage diverse
tasks, and insufficient plasticity. Our code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: LCRReg是一种新颖的正则化方法，利用潜在概念表示(LCRs)来引导医学影像深度学习模型学习语义基础的表征，提高对分布偏移的鲁棒性，无需主训练集中的概念标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像深度学习模型往往依赖虚假相关性而非临床有意义的特征，在分布偏移下泛化能力差，需要一种轻量级的方法来提升模型鲁棒性。

Method: 使用小型辅助数据集合成高质量、解耦的概念示例，提取预定义相关特征的LCRs，通过正则化项引导CNN在相关概念潜在子空间内激活。

Result: 在合成和真实医学任务中验证有效：在受控数据集上显著提升对注入虚假相关性的鲁棒性；在糖尿病视网膜病变分类任务中，在合成扰动和OOD泛化下性能均有提升。

Conclusion: LCRReg提供了一种轻量级、架构无关的策略，无需密集概念监督即可改善模型鲁棒性，优于多任务学习、线性探测和后处理概念模型等基线方法。

Abstract: Deep learning models in medical imaging often achieve strong in-distribution
performance but struggle to generalise under distribution shifts, frequently
relying on spurious correlations instead of clinically meaningful features. We
introduce LCRReg, a novel regularisation approach that leverages Latent Concept
Representations (LCRs) (e.g., Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs)) to guide
models toward semantically grounded representations. LCRReg requires no concept
labels in the main training set and instead uses a small auxiliary dataset to
synthesise high-quality, disentangled concept examples. We extract LCRs for
predefined relevant features, and incorporate a regularisation term that guides
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to activate within latent subspaces
associated with those concepts. We evaluate LCRReg across synthetic and
real-world medical tasks. On a controlled toy dataset, it significantly
improves robustness to injected spurious correlations and remains effective
even in multi-concept and multiclass settings. On the diabetic retinopathy
binary classification task, LCRReg enhances performance under both synthetic
spurious perturbations and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation. Compared
to baselines, including multitask learning, linear probing, and post-hoc
concept-based models, LCRReg offers a lightweight, architecture-agnostic
strategy for improving model robustness without requiring dense concept
supervision. Code is available at the following link:

Motivation: 南亚地区霾霍事件严重影响空气质量和社会经济，但缺乏区域性实时预测系统，需要开发有效的气潜能见度预测方法

Method: 使用Sentinel-5P卫星2019-2023年气潜数据，构建卷积长短期记忆网络(ConvLSTM)模型，利用340-380nm紫外线气潜指数进行预测

Result: 模型能够在5天间隔预测气潜指数，平均方差错误为0.0018，损失值0.3995，结构相似性指数0.74，表现良好

Conclusion: ConvLSTM模型在气潜事件预测中有效捐据空间和时间相关性，但仍需整合更多数据和优化模型架构来提升性能

Abstract: The South Asian Smog refers to the recurring annual air pollution events
marked by high contaminant levels, reduced visibility, and significant
socio-economic impacts, primarily affecting the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) from
November to February. Over the past decade, increased air pollution sources
such as crop residue burning, motor vehicles, and changing weather patterns
have intensified these smog events. However, real-time forecasting systems for
increased particulate matter concentrations are still not established at
regional scale. The Aerosol Index, closely tied to smog formation and a key
component in calculating the Air Quality Index (AQI), reflects particulate
matter concentrations. This study forecasts aerosol events using Sentinel-5P
air constituent data (2019-2023) and a Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory
(ConvLSTM) neural network, which captures spatial and temporal correlations
more effectively than previous models. Using the Ultraviolet (UV) Aerosol Index
at 340-380 nm as the predictor, results show the Aerosol Index can be
forecasted at five-day intervals with a Mean Squared Error of ~0.0018, loss of
~0.3995, and Structural Similarity Index of ~0.74. While effective, the model
can be improved by integrating additional data and refining its architecture.

Conclusion: 通过结合卷积操作和交叉注意机制，SCRNet能够同时有效处理长程依赖关系和局部上下文信息，为医学超声图像分割提供了一种优称的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical ultrasound image segmentation presents a formidable challenge in the
realm of computer vision. Traditional approaches rely on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based methods to address the intricacies of
medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, inherent limitations persist, as
CNN-based methods tend to disregard long-range dependencies, while
Transformer-based methods may overlook local contextual information. To address
these deficiencies, we propose a novel Feature Aggregation Module (FAM)
designed to process two input features from the preceding layer. These features
are seamlessly directed into two branches of the Convolution and
Cross-Attention Parallel Module (CCAPM) to endow them with different roles in
each of the two branches to help establish a strong connection between the two
input features. This strategy enables our module to focus concurrently on both
long-range dependencies and local contextual information by judiciously merging
convolution operations with cross-attention mechanisms. Moreover, by
integrating FAM within our proposed Spatial-Channel Regulation Module (SCRM),
the ability to discern salient regions and informative features warranting
increased attention is enhanced. Furthermore, by incorporating the SCRM into
the encoder block of the UNet architecture, we introduce a novel framework
dubbed Spatial-Channel Regulation Network (SCRNet). The results of our
extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SCRNet, which consistently
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: PhysGM通过联合预测3D表示和物理属性，结合DPO优化和新的PhysAssets数据集，成功克服了现有方法的局限性，实现了高效且高质量的物理模拟4D渲染。

Abstract: While physics-grounded 3D motion synthesis has seen significant progress,
current methods face critical limitations. They typically rely on
pre-reconstructed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations, while physics
integration depends on either inflexible, manually defined physical attributes
or unstable, optimization-heavy guidance from video models. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce PhysGM, a feed-forward framework that jointly predicts
a 3D Gaussian representation and its physical properties from a single image,
enabling immediate, physical simulation and high-fidelity 4D rendering. We
first establish a base model by jointly optimizing for Gaussian reconstruction
and probabilistic physics prediction. The model is then refined with physically
plausible reference videos to enhance both rendering fidelity and physics
prediction accuracy. We adopt the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align
its simulations with reference videos, circumventing Score Distillation
Sampling (SDS) optimization which needs back-propagating gradients through the
complex differentiable simulation and rasterization. To facilitate the
training, we introduce a new dataset PhysAssets of over 24,000 3D assets,
annotated with physical properties and corresponding guiding videos.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively generates
high-fidelity 4D simulations from a single image in one minute. This represents
a significant speedup over prior works while delivering realistic rendering
results. Our project page is at:https://hihixiaolv.github.io/PhysGM.github.io/

Abstract: Image degradation caused by complex lighting conditions such as low-light and
backlit scenarios is commonly encountered in real-world environments,
significantly affecting image quality and downstream vision tasks. Most
existing methods focus on a single type of illumination degradation and lack
the ability to handle diverse lighting conditions in a unified manner. To
address this issue, we propose a dual-illumination enhancement framework called
DIME-Net. The core of our method is a Mixture-of-Experts illumination estimator
module, where a sparse gating mechanism adaptively selects suitable S-curve
expert networks based on the illumination characteristics of the input image.
By integrating Retinex theory, this module effectively performs enhancement
tailored to both low-light and backlit images. To further correct
illumination-induced artifacts and color distortions, we design a damage
restoration module equipped with Illumination-Aware Cross Attention and
Sequential-State Global Attention mechanisms. In addition, we construct a
hybrid illumination dataset, MixBL, by integrating existing datasets, allowing
our model to achieve robust illumination adaptability through a single training
process. Experimental results show that DIME-Net achieves competitive
performance on both synthetic and real-world low-light and backlit datasets
without any retraining. These results demonstrate its generalization ability
and potential for practical multimedia applications under diverse and complex
illumination conditions.

Abstract: Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) aims to predict the utility of a face
image for face recognition (FR) systems. State-of-the-art FIQA methods mainly
rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leaving the potential of Vision
Transformer (ViT) architectures underexplored. This work proposes ViT-FIQA, a
novel approach that extends standard ViT backbones, originally optimized for
FR, through a learnable quality token designed to predict a scalar utility
score for any given face image. The learnable quality token is concatenated
with the standard image patch tokens, and the whole sequence is processed via
global self-attention by the ViT encoders to aggregate contextual information
across all patches. At the output of the backbone, ViT-FIQA branches into two
heads: (1) the patch tokens are passed through a fully connected layer to learn
discriminative face representations via a margin-penalty softmax loss, and (2)
the quality token is fed into a regression head to learn to predict the face
sample's utility. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks and several
FR models, including both CNN- and ViT-based architectures, demonstrate that
ViT-FIQA consistently achieves top-tier performance. These results underscore
the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures in modeling face image
utility and highlight the potential of ViTs as a scalable foundation for future
FIQA research https://cutt.ly/irHlzXUC.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a fundamental task for 3D scene understanding in
autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Existing depth datasets,
such as KITTI, nuScenes, and DDAD, have advanced the field but suffer from
limitations in diversity and scalability. As benchmark performance on these
datasets approaches saturation, there is an increasing need for a new
generation of large-scale, diverse, and cost-efficient datasets to support the
era of foundation models and multi-modal learning. To address these challenges,
we introduce a large-scale, diverse, frame-wise continuous dataset for depth
estimation in dynamic outdoor driving environments, comprising 20K video frames
to evaluate existing methods. Our lightweight acquisition pipeline ensures
broad scene coverage at low cost, while sparse yet statistically sufficient
ground truth enables robust training. Compared to existing datasets, ours
presents greater diversity in driving scenarios and lower depth density,
creating new challenges for generalization. Benchmark experiments with standard
monocular depth estimation models validate the dataset's utility and highlight
substantial performance gaps in challenging conditions, establishing a new
platform for advancing depth estimation research.

Abstract: Video action detection requires dense spatio-temporal annotations, which are
both challenging and expensive to obtain. However, real-world videos often vary
in difficulty and may not require the same level of annotation. This paper
analyzes the appropriate annotation types for each sample and their impact on
spatio-temporal video action detection. It focuses on two key aspects: 1) how
to obtain varying levels of annotation for videos, and 2) how to learn action
detection from different annotation types. The study explores video-level tags,
points, scribbles, bounding boxes, and pixel-level masks. First, a simple
active learning strategy is proposed to estimate the necessary annotation type
for each video. Then, a novel spatio-temporal 3D-superpixel approach is
introduced to generate pseudo-labels from these annotations, enabling effective
training. The approach is validated on UCF101-24 and JHMDB-21 datasets,
significantly cutting annotation costs with minimal performance loss.

Abstract: Outside of urban hubs, autonomous cars and trucks have to master driving on
intercity highways. Safe, long-distance highway travel at speeds exceeding 100
km/h demands perception distances of at least 250 m, which is about five times
the 50-100m typically addressed in city driving, to allow sufficient planning
and braking margins. Increasing the perception ranges also allows to extend
autonomy from light two-ton passenger vehicles to large-scale forty-ton trucks,
which need a longer planning horizon due to their high inertia. However, most
existing perception approaches focus on shorter ranges and rely on Bird's Eye
View (BEV) representations, which incur quadratic increases in memory and
compute costs as distance grows. To overcome this limitation, we built on top
of a sparse representation and introduced an efficient 3D encoding of
multi-modal and temporal features, along with a novel self-supervised
pre-training scheme that enables large-scale learning from unlabeled
camera-LiDAR data. Our approach extends perception distances to 250 meters and
achieves an 26.6% improvement in mAP in object detection and a decrease of
30.5% in Chamfer Distance in LiDAR forecasting compared to existing methods,
reaching distances up to 250 meters. Project Page:

Conclusion: 通过适应性视角选择策略，成功实现了高质量的在线3D高斯涂射模型生成，显著提升了模型完整性和重建质量

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of generating online 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) models from RGB-only frames. Previous studies have employed dense SLAM
techniques to estimate 3D scenes from keyframes for 3DGS model construction.
However, these methods are limited by their reliance solely on keyframes, which
are insufficient to capture an entire scene, resulting in incomplete
reconstructions. Moreover, building a generalizable model requires
incorporating frames from diverse viewpoints to achieve broader scene coverage.
However, online processing restricts the use of many frames or extensive
training iterations. Therefore, we propose a novel method for high-quality 3DGS
modeling that improves model completeness through adaptive view selection. By
analyzing reconstruction quality online, our approach selects optimal
non-keyframes for additional training. By integrating both keyframes and
selected non-keyframes, the method refines incomplete regions from diverse
viewpoints, significantly enhancing completeness. We also present a framework
that incorporates an online multi-view stereo approach, ensuring consistency in
3D information throughout the 3DGS modeling process. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering
exceptional performance in complex outdoor scenes.

Result: Noisy Alignment方法达到了现有最佳性能，同时保持了清洁数据的准确性，并展现出对常见后门防御方法的稳健性

Conclusion: 该方法简单但高效，为自盛对比学习中的数据毒化后门攻击提供了一种有效的解决方案

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) effectively learns transferable
representations from unlabeled data containing images or image-text pairs but
suffers vulnerability to data poisoning backdoor attacks (DPCLs). An adversary
can inject poisoned images into pretraining datasets, causing compromised CL
encoders to exhibit targeted misbehavior in downstream tasks. Existing DPCLs,
however, achieve limited efficacy due to their dependence on fragile implicit
co-occurrence between backdoor and target object and inadequate suppression of
discriminative features in backdoored images. We propose Noisy Alignment (NA),
a DPCL method that explicitly suppresses noise components in poisoned images.
Inspired by powerful training-controllable CL attacks, we identify and extract
the critical objective of noisy alignment, adapting it effectively into
data-poisoning scenarios. Our method implements noisy alignment by
strategically manipulating contrastive learning's random cropping mechanism,
formulating this process as an image layout optimization problem with
theoretically derived optimal parameters. The resulting method is simple yet
effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to existing DPCLs,
while maintaining clean-data accuracy. Furthermore, Noisy Alignment
demonstrates robustness against common backdoor defenses. Codes can be found at

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video AIGC have ushered in a transformative era for
audio-driven human animation. However, conventional video dubbing techniques
remain constrained to mouth region editing, resulting in discordant facial
expressions and body gestures that compromise viewer immersion. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce sparse-frame video dubbing, a novel paradigm that
strategically preserves reference keyframes to maintain identity, iconic
gestures, and camera trajectories while enabling holistic, audio-synchronized
full-body motion editing. Through critical analysis, we identify why naive
image-to-video models fail in this task, particularly their inability to
achieve adaptive conditioning. Addressing this, we propose InfiniteTalk, a
streaming audio-driven generator designed for infinite-length long sequence
dubbing. This architecture leverages temporal context frames for seamless
inter-chunk transitions and incorporates a simple yet effective sampling
strategy that optimizes control strength via fine-grained reference frame
positioning. Comprehensive evaluations on HDTF, CelebV-HQ, and EMTD datasets
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Quantitative metrics confirm superior
visual realism, emotional coherence, and full-body motion synchronization.

We introduce a token matching strategy that ensures accurate spatial
correspondence during refinement, enabling local detail synthesis while

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has exhibited remarkable efficacy in novel view
synthesis (NVS). However, it suffers from a significant drawback: achieving
high-fidelity rendering typically necessitates a large number of 3D Gaussians,
resulting in substantial memory consumption and storage requirements. To
address this challenge, we propose the first knowledge distillation framework
for 3DGS, featuring various teacher models, including vanilla 3DGS,
noise-augmented variants, and dropout-regularized versions. The outputs of
these teachers are aggregated to guide the optimization of a lightweight
student model. To distill the hidden geometric structure, we propose a
structural similarity loss to boost the consistency of spatial geometric
distributions between the student and teacher model. Through comprehensive
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across diverse datasets, the proposed
Distilled-3DGS, a simple yet effective framework without bells and whistles,
achieves promising rendering results in both rendering quality and storage
efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods. Project page:

Abstract: Composed video retrieval is a challenging task that strives to retrieve a
target video based on a query video and a textual description detailing
specific modifications. Standard retrieval frameworks typically struggle to
handle the complexity of fine-grained compositional queries and variations in
temporal understanding limiting their retrieval ability in the fine-grained

fine-grained and composed actions across diverse video segments, enabling more
detailed compositional changes in retrieved video content. The proposed
dataset, named Dense-WebVid-CoVR, consists of 1.6 million samples with dense
modification text that is around seven times more than its existing
counterpart. We further develop a new model that integrates visual and textual
information through Cross-Attention (CA) fusion using grounded text encoder,
enabling precise alignment between dense query modifications and target videos.
The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results surpassing existing
methods on all metrics. Notably, it achieves 71.3\% Recall@1 in visual+text
setting and outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3.4\%, highlighting its
