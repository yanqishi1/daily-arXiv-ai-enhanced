To address these limitations, we propose Inversion-DPO, a novel\nalignment framework that circumvents reward modeling by reformulating Direct\nPreference Optimization (DPO) with DDIM inversion for DMs. Our method conducts\nintractable posterior sampling in Diffusion-DPO with the deterministic\ninversion from winning and losing samples to noise and thus derive a new\npost-training paradigm.

While recent efforts have explored adapting large language\nmodels (LLMs) for time-series forecasting, LLMs primarily capture\none-dimensional sequential dependencies and struggle to model the richer\nspatio-temporal (ST) correlations essential for accurate ST forecasting. In\nthis paper, we present \\textbf{ST-VFM}, a novel framework that systematically\nreprograms Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for general-purpose spatio-temporal\nforecasting. While VFMs offer powerful spatial priors, two key challenges arise\nwhen applying them to ST tasks: (1) the lack of inherent temporal modeling\ncapacity and (2) the modality gap between visual and ST data. To address these,\nST-VFM adopts a \\emph{dual-branch architecture} that integrates raw ST inputs\nwith auxiliary ST flow inputs, where the flow encodes lightweight temporal\ndifference signals interpretable as dynamic spatial cues. To effectively\nprocess these dual-branch inputs, ST-VFM introduces two dedicated reprogramming\nstages. The \\emph{pre-VFM reprogramming} stage applies a Temporal-Aware Token\nAdapter to embed temporal context and align both branches into VFM-compatible\nfeature spaces. The \\emph{post-VFM reprogramming} stage introduces a Bilateral\nCross-Prompt Coordination module, enabling dynamic interaction between branches\nthrough prompt-based conditioning, thus enriching joint representation learning\nwithout modifying the frozen VFM backbone.

Accepted to COLM 2025", "summary": "Recognizing the information flows and operations comprising data science and\nmachine learning Python notebooks is critical for evaluating, reusing, and\nadapting notebooks for new tasks. Investigating a notebook via re-execution\noften is impractical due to the challenges of resolving data and software\ndependencies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) pre-trained on large codebases\nhave demonstrated effectiveness in understanding code without running it, we\nobserve that they fail to understand some realistic notebooks due to\nhallucinations and long-context challenges. To address these issues, we propose\na notebook understanding task yielding an information flow graph and\ncorresponding cell execution dependency graph for a notebook, and demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of a pincer strategy that uses limited syntactic analysis to\nassist full comprehension of the notebook using an LLM. Our Capture and Resolve\nAssisted Bounding Strategy (CRABS) employs shallow syntactic parsing and\nanalysis of the abstract syntax tree (AST) to capture the correct\ninterpretation of a notebook between lower and upper estimates of the\ninter-cell I/O sets, then uses an LLM to resolve remaining ambiguities via\ncell-by-cell zero-shot learning, thereby identifying the true data inputs and\noutputs of each cell. We evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach using an annotated dataset of 50 representative, highly up-voted\nKaggle notebooks that together represent 3454 actual cell inputs and outputs.\nThe LLM correctly resolves 1397 of 1425 (98%) ambiguities left by analyzing the\nsyntactic structure of these notebooks.

Our approach introduces several key innovations: (1) a\nmasked-input formulation where multiple future tokens are jointly predicted\nfrom a common prefix; (2) a gated LoRA formulation that preserves the original\nLLM's functionality, while equipping it for multi-token prediction; (3) a\nlightweight, learnable sampler module that generates coherent sequences from\nthe predicted future tokens; (4) a set of auxiliary training losses, including\na consistency loss, to enhance the coherence and accuracy of jointly generated\ntokens; and (5) a speculative generation strategy that expands tokens\nquadratically in the future while maintaining high fidelity.

However,\naccording to the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem, high-frequency components\nare vulnerable to aliasing or distortion when propagating through downsampling\nlayers such as strided-convolution. Here, we propose a novel Spatial Frequency\nModulation (SFM) that modulates high-frequency features to a lower frequency\nbefore downsampling and then demodulates them back during upsampling.\nSpecifically, we implement modulation through adaptive resampling (ARS) and\ndesign a lightweight add-on that can densely sample the high-frequency areas to\nscale up the signal, thereby lowering its frequency in accordance with the\nFrequency Scaling Property. We also propose Multi-Scale Adaptive Upsampling\n(MSAU) to demodulate the modulated feature and recover high-frequency\ninformation through non-uniform upsampling This module further improves\nsegmentation by explicitly exploiting information interaction between densely\nand sparsely resampled areas at multiple scales. Both modules can seamlessly\nintegrate with various architectures, extending from convolutional neural\nnetworks to transformers. Feature visualization and analysis confirm that our\nmethod effectively alleviates aliasing while successfully retaining details\nafter demodulation.

Prior work has shown that LLMs' refusal\nbehaviors can be mediated by a one-dimensional subspace, i.e., a refusal\ndirection. In this work, we identify a new dimension to analyze safety\nmechanisms in LLMs, i.e., harmfulness, which is encoded internally as a\nseparate concept from refusal. There exists a harmfulness direction that is\ndistinct from the refusal direction. As causal evidence, steering along the\nharmfulness direction can lead LLMs to interpret harmless instructions as\nharmful, but steering along the refusal direction tends to elicit refusal\nresponses directly without reversing the model's judgment on harmfulness.\nFurthermore, using our identified harmfulness concept, we find that certain\njailbreak methods work by reducing the refusal signals without reversing the\nmodel's internal belief of harmfulness. We also find that adversarially\nfinetuning models to accept harmful instructions has minimal impact on the\nmodel's internal belief of harmfulness. These insights lead to a practical\nsafety application: The model's latent harmfulness representation can serve as\nan intrinsic safeguard (Latent Guard) for detecting unsafe inputs and reducing\nover-refusals that is robust to finetuning attacks. For instance, our Latent\nGuard achieves performance comparable to or better than Llama Guard 3 8B, a\ndedicated finetuned safeguard model, across different jailbreak methods.

Therefore, evaluating the visual quality of compressed videos is\ncrucial for guiding the practical usage and further development of video\ncompression algorithms. Although numerous compressed video quality assessment\n(VQA) methods have been proposed, they often lack the generalization capability\nneeded to handle the increasing diversity of video types, particularly high\ndynamic range (HDR) content. In this paper, we introduce CompressedVQA-HDR, an\neffective VQA framework designed to address the challenges of HDR video quality\nassessment. Specifically, we adopt the Swin Transformer and SigLip 2 as the\nbackbone networks for the proposed full-reference (FR) and no-reference (NR)\nVQA models, respectively. For the FR model, we compute deep structural and\ntextural similarities between reference and distorted frames using\nintermediate-layer features extracted from the Swin Transformer as its\nquality-aware feature representation. For the NR model, we extract the global\nmean of the final-layer feature maps from SigLip 2 as its quality-aware\nrepresentation. To mitigate the issue of limited HDR training data, we\npre-train the FR model on a large-scale standard dynamic range (SDR) VQA\ndataset and fine-tune it on the HDRSDR-VQA dataset. For the NR model, we employ\nan iterative mixed-dataset training strategy across multiple compressed VQA\ndatasets, followed by fine-tuning on the HDRSDR-VQA dataset.

In this paper, we present Global-Spatial Bias Learner (GS-Bias),\nan efficient and effective TTA paradigm that incorporates two learnable biases\nduring TTA, unfolded as the global bias and spatial bias. Particularly, the\nglobal bias captures the global semantic features of a test image by learning\nconsistency across augmented views, while spatial bias learns the semantic\ncoherence between regions in the image's spatial visual representation. It is\nworth highlighting that these two sets of biases are directly added to the\nlogits outputed by the pretrained VLMs, which circumvent the full\nbackpropagation through VLM that hinders the efficiency of existing TTA\nmethods.

Although unsupervised\npart discovery can eliminate the reliance on labels, most of them cannot\nmaintain robustness across various categories and scenarios, which restricts\ntheir application range. To overcome this limitation, we present a more\neffective paradigm for unsupervised part discovery, named Masked Part\nAutoencoder (MPAE). It first learns part descriptors as well as a feature map\nfrom the inputs and produces patch features from a masked version of the\noriginal images. Then, the masked regions are filled with the learned part\ndescriptors based on the similarity between the local features and descriptors.\nBy restoring these masked patches using the part descriptors, they become\nbetter aligned with their part shapes, guided by appearance features from\nunmasked patches. Finally, MPAE robustly discovers meaningful parts that\nclosely match the actual object shapes, even in complex scenarios. Moreover,\nseveral looser yet more effective constraints are proposed to enable MPAE to\nidentify the presence of parts across various scenarios and categories in an\nunsupervised manner. This provides the foundation for addressing challenges\nposed by occlusion and for exploring part similarity across multiple\ncategories.

We introduce ID-EA, a novel framework that\nguides text embeddings to align with visual identity embeddings, thereby\nimproving identity preservation in a personalized generation. ID-EA comprises\ntwo key components: the ID-driven Enhancer (ID-Enhancer) and the ID-conditioned\nAdapter (ID-Adapter). First, the ID-Enhancer integrates identity embeddings\nwith a textual ID anchor, refining visual identity embeddings derived from a\nface recognition model using representative text embeddings. Then, the\nID-Adapter leverages the identity-enhanced embedding to adapt the text\ncondition, ensuring identity preservation by adjusting the cross-attention\nmodule in the pre-trained UNet model. This process encourages the text features\nto find the most related visual clues across the foreground snippets.

However, the attention\nmechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the\nstacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency\nvanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose\na novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention\nModulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly\nmodulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two\ntechniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling\n(FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental\nelements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass\nfiltering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and\ndynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different\nfrequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response\nfunction. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we\ndemonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to\nconsistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer,\nDeiT, and MaskDINO. These improvements are evident in tasks such as semantic\nsegmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation.

MaskTwins uncovers intrinsic structural patterns that persist across\ndisparate domains by enforcing consistency between predictions of images masked\nin complementary ways, enabling domain generalization in an end-to-end manner.\nExtensive experiments verify the superiority of MaskTwins over baseline methods\nin natural and biological image segmentation. These results demonstrate the\nsignificant advantages of MaskTwins in extracting domain-invariant features\nwithout the need for separate pre-training, offering a new paradigm for\ndomain-adaptive segmentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5c06\u63a9\u7801\u56fe\u50cf\u5efa\u6a21\uff08MIM\uff09\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u4fe1\u53f7\u91cd\u5efa\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faMaskTwins\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e92\u8865\u63a9\u7801\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff08UDA\uff09\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5c06\u63a9\u7801\u89c6\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u53d8\u5f62\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u63a9\u7801\u91cd\u5efa\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u63a9\u7801\u91cd\u5efa\u89c6\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u4fe1\u53f7\u91cd\u5efa\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faMaskTwins\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e92\u8865\u63a9\u7801\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u57df\u65e0\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eMaskTwins\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u548c\u751f\u7269\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5355\u72ec\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u63d0\u53d6\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "MaskTwins\u4e3a\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u5272\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u63a9\u7801\u91cd\u5efa\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u4e2d\u7684\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Deep clustering\nnetworks simultaneously encode and cluster patches of medical images into a\nlow-dimensional latent space to establish a tissue vocabulary. The resulting\ntissue types capture differential tissue change and its location in the liver\nassociated with treatment response. We demonstrate the utility of the\nvocabulary on a randomized controlled trial cohort of non-alcoholic\nsteatohepatitis patients. First, we use the vocabulary to compare longitudinal\nliver change in a placebo and a treatment cohort.

To this end, this paper\nproposes a new SS-DC framework based on a decoupling-coupling strategy.

Due to the style and content\ninformation being highly embedded in different frequency bands, this module can\ndecouple DI and DS components more accurately and interpretably. A novel filter\nbank-based spectral processing paradigm and a self-distillation-driven\ndecoupling loss are proposed to improve the spectral domain decoupling.

In this work, we introduce the inaugural\nmethodology addressing this critical, yet unresolved challenge, termed Dataset\nOwnership Verification for Masked Modeling (DOV4MM). The central objective is\nto ascertain whether a suspicious black-box model has been pre-trained on a\nparticular unlabeled dataset, thereby assisting dataset owners in safeguarding\ntheir rights. DOV4MM is grounded in our empirical observation that when a model\nis pre-trained on the target dataset, the difficulty of reconstructing masked\ninformation within the embedding space exhibits a marked contrast to models not\npre-trained on that dataset.

Second, their\nreliance on pseudo-labels to supervise novel class clustering often results in\nunstable performance, as pseudo-label quality is highly sensitive to factors\nsuch as data noise and feature dimensionality. To address these challenges, we\npropose a novel framework named Intra-view and Inter-view Correlation Guided\nMulti-view Novel Class Discovery (IICMVNCD), which is the first attempt to\nexplore NCD in multi-view setting so far.

The base matrices\ncapture distributional consistency among the two datasets, while the factor\nmatrices model pairwise relationships between samples. At the inter-view level,\nwe utilize view relationships among known classes to guide the clustering of\nnovel classes.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have strong generative\ncapabilities, they are limited by static pretraining, short context windows,\nand challenges in processing heterogeneous data formats. Conventional\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks address some of these gaps but\noften struggle with structured and semi-structured data.\n  This work proposes an advanced RAG framework that combines hybrid retrieval\nstrategies using dense embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2) and BM25, enhanced by\nmetadata-aware filtering with SpaCy NER and cross-encoder reranking. The\nframework applies semantic chunking to maintain textual coherence and retains\ntabular data structures to preserve row-column integrity. Quantized indexing\noptimizes retrieval efficiency, while human-in-the-loop feedback and\nconversation memory improve adaptability.\n  Experiments on enterprise datasets show notable improvements: Precision@5\nincreased by 15 percent (90 versus 75), Recall@5 by 13 percent (87 versus 74),\nand Mean Reciprocal Rank by 16 percent (0.85 versus 0.69). Qualitative\nevaluations show higher scores in Faithfulness (4.6 versus 3.0), Completeness\n(4.2 versus 2.5), and Relevance (4.5 versus 3.2) on a 5-point Likert scale.\nThese results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in delivering accurate,\ncomprehensive, and contextually relevant responses for enterprise tasks.

However, current routing systems (e.g., online maps) fail\nto incorporate shade information due to the difficulty of estimating shades\ndirectly from noisy satellite imagery and the limited availability of training\ndata for generative models. In this paper, we address these challenges through\ntwo main contributions. First, we build an extensive dataset covering diverse\nlongitude-latitude regions, varying levels of building density, and different\nurban layouts. Leveraging Blender-based 3D simulations alongside building\noutlines, we capture building shadows under various solar zenith angles\nthroughout the year and at different times of day. These simulated shadows are\naligned with satellite images, providing a rich resource for learning shade\npatterns. Second, we propose the DeepShade, a diffusion-based model designed to\nlearn and synthesize shade variations over time. It emphasizes the nuance of\nedge features by jointly considering RGB with the Canny edge layer, and\nincorporates contrastive learning to capture the temporal change rules of\nshade. Then, by conditioning on textual descriptions of known conditions (e.g.,\ntime of day, solar angles), our framework provides improved performance in\ngenerating shade images.

Inspired by the strong power of\nOut-of-Distribution (OoD) data on other visual tasks, we propose a data-centric\nframework, Med-OoD to address this issue by introducing OoD data supervision\ninto fully-supervised biomedical segmentation with none of the following needs:\n(i) external data sources, (ii) feature regularization objectives, (iii)\nadditional annotations. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into\nsegmentation networks without any modification on the architectures. Extensive\nexperiments show that Med-OoD largely prevents various segmentation networks\nfrom the pixel misclassification on medical images and achieves considerable\nperformance improvements on Lizard dataset.

This\nleads to highly entangled features and strong black-box characteristics, making\nthe model prone to shortcut learning. To mitigate the above issues, this paper\nproposes a wavelet-based low-light stereo image enhancement method with feature\nspace decoupling. Our insight comes from the following findings: (1) Wavelet\ntransform enables the independent processing of low-frequency and\nhigh-frequency information. (2) Illumination adjustment can be achieved by\nadjusting the low-frequency component of a low-light image, extracted through\nmulti-level wavelet decomposition. Thus, by using wavelet transform the feature\nspace is decomposed into a low-frequency branch for illumination adjustment and\nmultiple high-frequency branches for texture enhancement. Additionally, stereo\nlow-light image enhancement can extract useful cues from another view to\nimprove enhancement. To this end, we propose a novel high-frequency guided\ncross-view interaction module (HF-CIM) that operates within high-frequency\nbranches rather than across the entire feature space, effectively extracting\nvaluable image details from the other view. Furthermore, to enhance the\nhigh-frequency information, a detail and texture enhancement module (DTEM) is\nproposed based on cross-attention mechanism.

Defined by oxygen dependence at 36 weeks\npostmenstrual age, it causes lifelong respiratory complications. However,\npreventive interventions carry severe risks, including neurodevelopmental\nimpairment, ventilator-induced lung injury, and systemic complications.\nTherefore, early BPD prognosis and prediction of BPD outcome is crucial to\navoid unnecessary toxicity in low risk infants. Admission radiographs of\nextremely preterm infants are routinely acquired within 24h of life and could\nserve as a non-invasive prognostic tool. In this work, we developed and\ninvestigated a deep learning approach using chest X-rays from 163 extremely\nlow-birth-weight infants ($\\leq$32 weeks gestation, 401-999g) obtained within\n24 hours of birth. We fine-tuned a ResNet-50 pretrained specifically on adult\nchest radiographs, employing progressive layer freezing with discriminative\nlearning rates to prevent overfitting and evaluated a CutMix augmentation and\nlinear probing. For moderate/severe BPD outcome prediction, our best performing\nmodel with progressive freezing, linear probing and CutMix achieved an AUROC of\n0.78 $\\pm$ 0.10, balanced accuracy of 0.69 $\\pm$ 0.10, and an F1-score of 0.67\n$\\pm$ 0.11. In-domain pre-training significantly outperformed ImageNet\ninitialization (p = 0.031) which confirms domain-specific pretraining to be\nimportant for BPD outcome prediction. Routine IRDS grades showed limited\nprognostic value (AUROC 0.57 $\\pm$ 0.11), confirming the need of learned\nmarkers.

In particular, we devise a\nscalable human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline based on vision-language models,\nwhich enables efficient creation of physics-first assets from raw 3D assets.2)\nFurthermore, we propose \\textbf{PhysXGen}, a feed-forward framework for\nphysics-grounded image-to-3D asset generation, injecting physical knowledge\ninto the pre-trained 3D structural space. Specifically, PhysXGen employs a\ndual-branch architecture to explicitly model the latent correlations between 3D\nstructures and physical properties, thereby producing 3D assets with plausible\nphysical predictions while preserving the native geometry quality. Extensive\nexperiments validate the superior performance and promising generalization\ncapability of our framework. All the code, data, and models will be released to\nfacilitate future research in generative physical AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faPhysX\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u76843D\u8d44\u4ea7\u751f\u6210\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6570\u636e\u96c6PhysXNet\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6PhysXGen\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5ffd\u89c6\u7269\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u5177\u8eabAI\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "1) \u6784\u5efa\u7269\u7406\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6PhysXNet\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u6846\u67b6PhysXGen\uff0c\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u6ce8\u5165\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76843D\u7ed3\u6784\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "PhysX\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u7269\u7406AI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5c06\u5f00\u6e90\u3002"}}
