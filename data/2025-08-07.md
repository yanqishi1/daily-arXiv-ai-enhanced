### [1] [How Deep Is Representational Bias in LLMs? The Cases of Caste and Religion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03712)
*Agrima Seth,Monojit Choudhary,Sunayana Sitaram,Kentaro Toyama,Aditya Vashistha,Kalika Bali*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现GPT-4 Turbo在生成印度生活事件故事时，宗教和种姓的多样性表现远低于实际人口分布，且文化主导群体被过度代表。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）在未被充分研究的身份维度（如宗教和种姓）上的表征偏见。

Method: 通过生成7,200个印度生活事件故事，比较模型输出与实际人口分布，量化偏见。

Result: GPT-4 Turbo过度代表文化主导群体，且提示多样性效果有限。

Conclusion: 仅多样化训练数据不足以纠正LLM偏见，需更根本的模型开发变革。

Abstract: Representational bias in large language models (LLMs) has predominantly been
measured through single-response interactions and has focused on Global
North-centric identities like race and gender. We expand on that research by
conducting a systematic audit of GPT-4 Turbo to reveal how deeply encoded
representational biases are and how they extend to less-explored dimensions of
identity. We prompt GPT-4 Turbo to generate over 7,200 stories about
significant life events (such as weddings) in India, using prompts designed to
encourage diversity to varying extents. Comparing the diversity of religious
and caste representation in the outputs against the actual population
distribution in India as recorded in census data, we quantify the presence and
"stickiness" of representational bias in the LLM for religion and caste. We
find that GPT-4 responses consistently overrepresent culturally dominant groups
far beyond their statistical representation, despite prompts intended to
encourage representational diversity. Our findings also suggest that
representational bias in LLMs has a winner-take-all quality that is more biased
than the likely distribution bias in their training data, and repeated
prompt-based nudges have limited and inconsistent efficacy in dislodging these
biases. These results suggest that diversifying training data alone may not be
sufficient to correct LLM bias, highlighting the need for more fundamental
changes in model development. Dataset and Codebook:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为高能物理理论研究开发专业化的语言模型，提升该领域文本处理的性能。

Method: 使用两种不同的低秩适应微调方法，在不同arXiv分类（如hep-th、hep-ph、gr-qc）上训练20个Llama-3.1变体，并与商业LLM（如ChatGPT、Claude等）进行比较。

Result: 微调后的模型在hep-th摘要完成任务上表现优于基础模型，并与商业LLM进行了性能对比。

Conclusion: 研究为高能物理理论领域的专业化语言模型开发提供了有效方法和进一步优化的方向。

Abstract: We present specialized Large Language Models for theoretical High-Energy
Physics, obtained as 20 fine-tuned variants of the 8-billion parameter
Llama-3.1 model. Each variant was trained on arXiv abstracts (through August
2024) from different combinations of hep-th, hep-ph and gr-qc. For a
comparative study, we also trained models on datasets that contained abstracts
from disparate fields such as the q-bio and cs categories. All models were
fine-tuned using two distinct Low-Rank Adaptation fine-tuning approaches and
varying dataset sizes, and outperformed the base model on hep-th abstract
completion tasks. We compare performance against leading commercial LLMs
(ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek) and derive insights for further developing
specialized language models for High-Energy Theoretical Physics.

### [3] [Intent Aware Context Retrieval for Multi-Turn Agricultural Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03719)
*Abhay Vijayvargia,Ajay Nagpal,Kundeshwar Pundalik,Atharva Savarkar,Smita Gautam,Pankaj Singh,Rohit Saluja,Ganesh Ramakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Krishi Sathi是一款AI驱动的农业聊天机器人，通过多轮对话和检索增强生成技术，为印度农民提供个性化、易理解的农业建议，支持英语和印地语，并具备语音功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决印度农民因低识字率和语言障碍难以获取及时农业建议的问题。

Method: 结合意图驱动对话、指令调优模型（IFT）和检索增强生成（RAG），支持多语言和语音输入输出。

Result: 响应准确率97.53%，上下文相关性和个性化91.35%，平均响应时间低于6秒。

Conclusion: Krishi Sathi通过技术整合显著提升了农业支持的质效和可及性。

Abstract: Indian farmers often lack timely, accessible, and language-friendly
agricultural advice, especially in rural areas with low literacy. To address
this gap in accessibility, this paper presents a novel AI-powered agricultural
chatbot, Krishi Sathi, designed to support Indian farmers by providing
personalized, easy-to-understand answers to their queries through both text and
speech. The system's intelligence stems from an IFT model, subsequently refined
through fine-tuning on Indian agricultural knowledge across three curated
datasets. Unlike traditional chatbots that respond to one-off questions, Krishi
Sathi follows a structured, multi-turn conversation flow to gradually collect
the necessary details from the farmer, ensuring the query is fully understood
before generating a response. Once the intent and context are extracted, the
system performs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by first fetching
information from a curated agricultural database and then generating a tailored
response using the IFT model. The chatbot supports both English and Hindi
languages, with speech input and output features (via ASR and TTS) to make it
accessible for users with low literacy or limited digital skills. This work
demonstrates how combining intent-driven dialogue flows, instruction-tuned
models, and retrieval-based generation can improve the quality and
accessibility of digital agricultural support in India.
  This approach yielded strong results, with the system achieving a query
response accuracy of 97.53%, 91.35% contextual relevance and personalization,
and a query completion rate of 97.53%. The average response time remained under
6 seconds, ensuring timely support for users across both English and Hindi
interactions.

### [4] [Hierarchical Verification of Speculative Beams for Accelerating LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03726)
*Jaydip Sen,Harshitha Puvvala,Subhasis Dasgupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为HVT的分层验证树框架，通过优先处理高概率草稿和早期剪枝次优候选，显著提升大型语言模型的推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在推理效率上因自回归特性面临挑战，传统方法顺序验证草稿序列导致计算开销大。

Method: 开发了分层验证树框架和验证-剪枝算法，优先处理高概率草稿并剪枝次优候选，无需重新训练或修改架构。

Result: 实验表明HVT在多个数据集和模型上优于现有推测解码方法，显著减少推理时间和能耗，同时保持或提升输出质量。

Conclusion: 分层验证策略为加速大型语言模型推理提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
natural language processing tasks but face persistent challenges in inference
efficiency due to their autoregressive nature. While speculative decoding and
beam sampling offer notable improvements, traditional methods verify draft
sequences sequentially without prioritization, leading to unnecessary
computational overhead. This work proposes the Hierarchical Verification Tree
(HVT), a novel framework that restructures speculative beam decoding by
prioritizing high-likelihood drafts and enabling early pruning of suboptimal
candidates. Theoretical foundations and a formal verification-pruning algorithm
are developed to ensure correctness and efficiency. Integration with standard
LLM inference pipelines is achieved without requiring retraining or
architecture modification. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets
and models demonstrate that HVT consistently outperforms existing speculative
decoding schemes, achieving substantial reductions in inference time and energy
consumption while maintaining or enhancing output quality. The findings
highlight the potential of hierarchical verification strategies as a new
direction for accelerating large language model inference.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WiNELL是一个基于LLM的多智能体框架，用于自动更新维基百科内容，通过聚合在线信息并生成编辑建议，其编辑模型在覆盖率和效率上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 维基百科依赖人工编辑更新内容，效率低且难以保持时效性。WiNELL旨在利用LLM智能体实现持续知识更新。

Method: 采用多智能体框架聚合信息，选择重要知识并生成编辑建议，编辑模型基于维基百科历史编辑数据训练。

Result: WiNELL在信息覆盖率和编辑效率上优于开源和闭源LLM（如GPT-4o），并能及时识别和更新事实。

Conclusion: WiNELL为LLM智能体自动更新知识库提供了新方向，展示了持续知识获取的潜力。

Abstract: Wikipedia, a vast and continuously consulted knowledge base, faces
significant challenges in maintaining up-to-date content due to its reliance on
manual human editors. Inspired by the vision of continuous knowledge
acquisition in NELL and fueled by advances in LLM-based agents, this paper
introduces WiNELL, an agentic framework for continuously updating Wikipedia
articles. Our approach employs a multi-agent framework to aggregate online
information, select new and important knowledge for a target entity in
Wikipedia, and then generate precise edit suggestions for human review. Our
fine-grained editing models, trained on Wikipedia's extensive history of human
edits, enable incorporating updates in a manner consistent with human editing
behavior. Our editor models outperform both open-source instruction-following
baselines and closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) in key information coverage and
editing efficiency. End-to-end evaluation on high-activity Wikipedia pages
demonstrates WiNELL's ability to identify and suggest timely factual updates.
This opens up a promising research direction in LLM agents for automatically
updating knowledge bases in a never-ending fashion.

### [6] [GanitBench: A bi-lingual benchmark for evaluating mathematical reasoning in Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03737)
*Ashutosh Bandooni,Brindha Subburaj*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GanitBench是一个多语言（英语和印地语）的数学视觉问题基准，用于评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）在零样本和两样本思维链（CoT）设置下的表现。GPT-4o mini表现最佳，但模型在印地语问题和“双锁”约束下性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准多为英语且缺乏印地语数学任务数据集，GanitBench填补了这一空白，促进多语言研究。

Method: 从印度两大考试（JEE Advanced和CBSE Boards）收集1527个视觉数学问题，评估两种闭源模型在零样本和两样本CoT设置下的表现。

Result: GPT-4o mini平均准确率最高（38.15%），但“双锁”约束和印地语问题显著降低模型性能。两样本CoT更有效。

Conclusion: GanitBench推动了印地语等多语言研究，模型在复杂约束和多语言任务中仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Benchmarks for evaluating reasoning among Vision Language Models (VLMs) on
several fields and domains are being curated more frequently over the last few
years. However these are often monolingual, mostly available in English.
Additionally there also is a lack of datasets available in Hindi on tasks apart
from comprehension and translation. We introduce GanitBench, a tough benchmark
consisting of 1527 vision-only questions covering several topics in Mathematics
- available in languages English and Hindi. Collected from two major
examinations from India, the JEE Advanced and the CBSE Boards examinations,
this benchmark includes questions in the form of images comprising of figures
essential to a question as well as text. We evaluate two closed source models
for the same, in zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and two-shot CoT settings.
GPT-4o mini is found to be the more dominant model on the benchmark, with it's
highest average accuracy being 38.15%. We also evaluate models through a
"Double Lock" constraint, which brings down the performance of the models by
considerable margins. We observe that two-shot CoT appears to be a more
effective setting under this environment. Performance of the two VLMs also
decreases when answering the same questions in the Hindi language. We hope to
facilitate the inclusion of languages like Hindi in research through our work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AttnTrace是一种基于LLM注意力权重的新上下文追溯方法，比现有方法更准确高效，并能提升提示注入检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有上下文追溯方法（如TracLLM）计算成本高，需改进效率与准确性。

Method: 提出AttnTrace，利用LLM的注意力权重，并引入两种技术增强其效果，提供理论支持。

Result: AttnTrace在准确性和效率上优于现有方法，并能提升长上下文下提示注入检测能力。

Conclusion: AttnTrace为上下文追溯提供了高效解决方案，具有实际应用价值，如检测恶意指令。

Abstract: Long-context large language models (LLMs), such as Gemini-2.5-Pro and
Claude-Sonnet-4, are increasingly used to empower advanced AI systems,
including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and autonomous agents.
In these systems, an LLM receives an instruction along with a context--often
consisting of texts retrieved from a knowledge database or memory--and
generates a response that is contextually grounded by following the
instruction. Recent studies have designed solutions to trace back to a subset
of texts in the context that contributes most to the response generated by the
LLM. These solutions have numerous real-world applications, including
performing post-attack forensic analysis and improving the interpretability and
trustworthiness of LLM outputs. While significant efforts have been made,
state-of-the-art solutions such as TracLLM often lead to a high computation
cost, e.g., it takes TracLLM hundreds of seconds to perform traceback for a
single response-context pair. In this work, we propose AttnTrace, a new context
traceback method based on the attention weights produced by an LLM for a
prompt. To effectively utilize attention weights, we introduce two techniques
designed to enhance the effectiveness of AttnTrace, and we provide theoretical
insights for our design choice. We also perform a systematic evaluation for
AttnTrace. The results demonstrate that AttnTrace is more accurate and
efficient than existing state-of-the-art context traceback methods. We also
show that AttnTrace can improve state-of-the-art methods in detecting prompt
injection under long contexts through the attribution-before-detection
paradigm. As a real-world application, we demonstrate that AttnTrace can
effectively pinpoint injected instructions in a paper designed to manipulate
LLM-generated reviews. The code is at

### [8] [Majority Bit-Aware Watermarking For Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03829)
*Jiahao Xu,Rui Hu,Zikai Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MajorMark是一种新型水印方法，通过多数位感知编码改善文本质量与解码准确性的权衡，优于现有多比特水印方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型生成有害或欺骗性内容的潜在滥用问题，水印技术被用于验证来源和追踪滥用。现有方法在文本质量和解码准确性之间存在权衡。

Method: MajorMark采用多数位感知编码选择偏好令牌集，并使用基于聚类的解码策略。MajorMark$^+$将消息分块独立编码和解码。

Result: 实验表明，MajorMark显著提高了解码准确性和文本生成质量，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: MajorMark及其改进版MajorMark$^+$在保持文本质量的同时，提高了水印解码的准确性，为水印技术提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: The growing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world
applications has raised concerns about their potential misuse in generating
harmful or deceptive content. To address this issue, watermarking techniques
have emerged as a promising solution by embedding identifiable binary messages
into generated text for origin verification and misuse tracing. While recent
efforts have explored multi-bit watermarking schemes capable of embedding rich
information such as user identifiers, they typically suffer from the
fundamental trade-off between text quality and decoding accuracy: to ensure
reliable message decoding, they have to restrict the size of preferred token
sets during encoding, yet such restrictions reduce the quality of the generated
content. In this work, we propose MajorMark, a novel watermarking method that
improves this trade-off through majority bit-aware encoding. MajorMark selects
preferred token sets based on the majority bit of the message, enabling a
larger and more flexible sampling of tokens. In contrast to prior methods that
rely on token frequency analysis for decoding, MajorMark employs a
clustering-based decoding strategy, which maintains high decoding accuracy even
when the preferred token set is large, thus preserving both content quality and
decoding accuracy. We further introduce MajorMark$^+$, which partitions the
message into multiple blocks to independently encode and deterministically
decode each block, thereby further enhancing the quality of watermarked text
and improving decoding accuracy. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs
demonstrate that our methods significantly enhance both decoding accuracy and
text generation quality, outperforming prior multi-bit watermarking baselines.

Conclusion: 论文强调需要开发更准确、可解释且适合领域特定事实核查的LLMs，推动更可信和上下文感知的语言模型研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast and diverse internet corpora
that often include inaccurate or misleading content. Consequently, LLMs can
generate misinformation, making robust fact-checking essential. This review
systematically analyzes how LLM-generated content is evaluated for factual
accuracy by exploring key challenges such as hallucinations, dataset
limitations, and the reliability of evaluation metrics. The review emphasizes
the need for strong fact-checking frameworks that integrate advanced prompting
strategies, domain-specific fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) methods. It proposes five research questions that guide the analysis of
the recent literature from 2020 to 2025, focusing on evaluation methods and
mitigation techniques. The review also discusses the role of instruction
tuning, multi-agent reasoning, and external knowledge access via RAG
frameworks. Key findings highlight the limitations of current metrics, the
value of grounding outputs with validated external evidence, and the importance
of domain-specific customization to improve factual consistency. Overall, the
review underlines the importance of building LLMs that are not only accurate
and explainable but also tailored for domain-specific fact-checking. These
insights contribute to the advancement of research toward more trustworthy and
context-aware language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有实体链接方法在长文本中表现良好，但在短文本问答任务中效果不佳，需要改进。

Method: 设计了一个基于大语言模型的代理，模拟人类认知流程，主动识别实体、检索候选实体并决策。

Result: 实验表明，该代理在工具型实体链接和问答任务中均表现出鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: 该代理为解决短文本问答中的实体链接问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Some Question Answering (QA) systems rely on knowledge bases (KBs) to provide
accurate answers. Entity Linking (EL) plays a critical role in linking natural
language mentions to KB entries. However, most existing EL methods are designed
for long contexts and do not perform well on short, ambiguous user questions in
QA tasks. We propose an entity linking agent for QA, based on a Large Language
Model that simulates human cognitive workflows. The agent actively identifies
entity mentions, retrieves candidate entities, and makes decision. To verify
the effectiveness of our agent, we conduct two experiments: tool-based entity
linking and QA task evaluation. The results confirm the robustness and
effectiveness of our agent.

TL;DR: 论文提出Sotopia-RL框架，通过细化奖励设计解决社交智能训练中的部分可观测性和多维度问题，显著提升模型在社交任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交智能对大型语言模型（LLMs）至关重要，但传统强化学习（RL）在社交任务中因部分可观测性和多维度行为而效率低下。

Method: 提出Sotopia-RL框架，将粗粒度的回合级反馈细化为话语级、多维度的奖励，以优化信用分配和减少奖励滥用。

Result: 在Sotopia环境中，Sotopia-RL在社交目标完成度上达到最优（7.17和8.31分），显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Sotopia-RL通过话语级信用分配和多维度奖励设计，有效提升了社交智能训练的效率和稳定性。

Abstract: Social intelligence has become a critical capability for large language
models (LLMs), enabling them to engage effectively in real-world social tasks
such as accommodation, persuasion, collaboration, and negotiation.
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a natural fit for training socially intelligent
agents because it allows models to learn sophisticated strategies directly
through social interactions. However, social interactions have two key
characteristics that set barriers for RL training: (1) partial observability,
where utterances have indirect and delayed effects that complicate credit
assignment, and (2) multi-dimensionality, where behaviors such as
rapport-building or knowledge-seeking contribute indirectly to goal
achievement. These characteristics make Markov decision process (MDP)-based RL
with single-dimensional episode-level rewards inefficient and unstable. To
address these challenges, we propose Sotopia-RL, a novel framework that refines
coarse episode-level feedback into utterance-level, multi-dimensional rewards.
Utterance-level credit assignment mitigates partial observability by
attributing outcomes to individual utterances, while multi-dimensional rewards
capture the full richness of social interactions and reduce reward hacking.
Experiments in Sotopia, an open-ended social learning environment, demonstrate
that Sotopia-RL achieves state-of-the-art social goal completion scores (7.17
on Sotopia-hard and 8.31 on Sotopia-full), significantly outperforming existing
approaches. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of both utterance-level
credit assignment and multi-dimensional reward design for RL training. Our
implementation is publicly available at:

TL;DR: CoAct-1通过结合GUI操作和编程执行，显著提升了自动化代理在复杂任务中的效率和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统GUI代理在复杂任务中的低效和脆弱性问题。

Method: 引入多代理系统CoAct-1，动态分配任务给GUI操作员或编程代理。

Result: 在OSWorld基准测试中，成功率达到60.76%，步骤数降至10.15。

Conclusion: 编程作为核心动作显著提升了计算机自动化的能力。

Abstract: Autonomous agents that operate computers via Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)
often struggle with efficiency and reliability on complex, long-horizon tasks.
While augmenting these agents with planners can improve task decomposition,
they remain constrained by the inherent limitations of performing all actions
through GUI manipulation, leading to brittleness and inefficiency. In this
work, we introduce a more robust and flexible paradigm: enabling agents to use
coding as a enhanced action. We present CoAct-1, a novel multi-agent system
that synergistically combines GUI-based control with direct programmatic
execution. CoAct-1 features an Orchestrator that dynamically delegates subtasks
to either a conventional GUI Operator or a specialized Programmer agent, which
can write and execute Python or Bash scripts. This hybrid approach allows the
agent to bypass inefficient GUI action sequences for tasks like file management
and data processing, while still leveraging visual interaction when necessary.
We evaluate our system on the challenging OSWorld benchmark, where CoAct-1
achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 60.76%, significantly
outperforming prior methods. Furthermore, our approach dramatically improves
efficiency, reducing the average number of steps required to complete a task to
just 10.15, compared to 15 for leading GUI agents. Our results demonstrate that
integrating coding as a core action provides a more powerful, efficient, and
scalable path toward generalized computer automation.

TL;DR: CAP-LLM是一种结合用户偏好和事实一致性的新闻标题生成框架，通过LLM提升个性化与准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在捕捉用户兴趣和确保事实一致性上的不足，避免生成通用或误导性标题。

Method: 提出CAP-LLM框架，包含用户偏好编码器、上下文注入适配器和事实一致性强化模块。

Result: 在PENS数据集上表现最优，显著提升事实一致性（FactCC 87.50）和个性化指标（Pc(avg) 2.73）。

Conclusion: CAP-LLM在新闻标题生成中实现了个性化与事实准确性的平衡，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: In the era of information overload, personalized news headline generation is
crucial for engaging users by tailoring content to their preferences while
accurately conveying news facts. Existing methods struggle with effectively
capturing complex user interests and ensuring factual consistency, often
leading to generic or misleading headlines. Leveraging the unprecedented
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in text generation, we propose
Context-Augmented Personalized LLM (CAP-LLM), a novel framework that integrates
user preferences and factual consistency constraints into a powerful
pre-trained LLM backbone. CAP-LLM features a User Preference Encoder to capture
long-term user interests, a Context Injection Adapter to seamlessly integrate
these preferences and current article context into the LLM's generation
process, and a Fact-Consistency Reinforcement Module employing a novel
contrastive loss to mitigate hallucination. Evaluated on the real-world PENS
dataset, CAP-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across all metrics.
Notably, it significantly improves factual consistency (FactCC of 87.50) over
strong baselines like BART (86.67), while simultaneously enhancing
personalization (Pc(avg) 2.73, Pc(max) 17.25) and content coverage (ROUGE-1
26.55, ROUGE-2 9.95, ROUGE-L 23.01). Our ablation studies, human evaluations,
and sensitivity analyses further validate the effectiveness of each component
and the robustness of our approach, demonstrating CAP-LLM's ability to achieve
a superior balance between personalization and factual accuracy in news
headline generation.

Result: 通过全生命周期治理，显著降低歧视风险，保护品牌声誉，提升AI系统的社会责任。

Conclusion: 本文为开发和应用社会责任感强、伦理对齐的生成式AI提供了实用框架。

Abstract: In this paper, we cover approaches to systematically govern, assess and
quantify bias across the complete life cycle of machine learning models, from
initial development and validation to ongoing production monitoring and
guardrail implementation. Building upon our foundational work on the Bias
Evaluation and Assessment Test Suite (BEATS) for Large Language Models, the
authors share prevalent bias and fairness related gaps in Large Language Models
(LLMs) and discuss data and AI governance framework to address Bias, Ethics,
Fairness, and Factuality within LLMs. The data and AI governance approach
discussed in this paper is suitable for practical, real-world applications,
enabling rigorous benchmarking of LLMs prior to production deployment,
facilitating continuous real-time evaluation, and proactively governing LLM
generated responses. By implementing the data and AI governance across the life
cycle of AI development, organizations can significantly enhance the safety and
responsibility of their GenAI systems, effectively mitigating risks of
discrimination and protecting against potential reputational or brand-related
harm. Ultimately, through this article, we aim to contribute to advancement of
the creation and deployment of socially responsible and ethically aligned

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究通过早期假设剪枝提高自一致性方法的令牌效率，同时保持其并行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自一致性方法虽然简单有效，但其高令牌消耗限制了实际应用。

Method: 并行生成所有解决方案，定期基于模型置信度和词汇覆盖度剪枝中间假设，并设计快速加权集覆盖算法。

Result: 在五个LLM和三个数学基准测试中，令牌效率提高了10-35%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了自一致性方法的令牌效率，适用于长链推理任务。

Abstract: Despite its simplicity and efficacy, the high token expenditure of
self-consistency can limit its practical utility. Here we investigate if
self-consistency can be made more token-efficient for long chain-of-thought
reasoning tasks, while preserving its parallelism, through early hypothesis
pruning. Concretely, we generate all solutions in parallel, but periodically
prune intermediate hypotheses that are deemed unnecessary based on two
lightweight indicators: (a) the model's own confidence in individual
hypotheses, and (b) lexical coverage of all current hypotheses by candidate
subsets that are under consideration for continued retention. We design a fast
weighted set cover algorithm that utilizes the two indicators; our evaluation
of five LLMs on three math benchmarks shows that this method can improve token
efficiency for all models, by 10-35% in many cases.

TL;DR: 研究探讨LLMs是否能生成准确且适合不同受众的健康解释，构建大规模数据集并评估模型表现，发现偏好学习显著提升解释质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人们越来越多地依赖LLMs理解健康问题，研究旨在验证LLMs能否生成既准确又适合不同受众的解释。

Method: 构建包含43,880条解释的数据集，采用双法官评估框架，并通过SFT和DPO微调开源LLM。

Result: LLM法官与人类评估一致；解释质量因模型、受众和类别而异；DPO和SFT微调模型表现优于更大模型。

Conclusion: 偏好学习能有效提升LLMs在专业解释任务中的表现，为健康领域的个性化解释提供新思路。

Abstract: Well-being encompasses mental, physical, and social dimensions essential to
personal growth and informed life decisions. As individuals increasingly
consult Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand well-being, a key challenge
emerges: Can LLMs generate explanations that are not only accurate but also
tailored to diverse audiences? High-quality explanations require both factual
correctness and the ability to meet the expectations of users with varying
expertise. In this work, we construct a large-scale dataset comprising 43,880
explanations of 2,194 well-being concepts, generated by ten diverse LLMs. We
introduce a principle-guided LLM-as-a-judge evaluation framework, employing
dual judges to assess explanation quality. Furthermore, we show that
fine-tuning an open-source LLM using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) can significantly enhance the quality of
generated explanations. Our results reveal: (1) The proposed LLM judges align
well with human evaluations; (2) explanation quality varies significantly
across models, audiences, and categories; and (3) DPO- and SFT-finetuned models
outperform their larger counterparts, demonstrating the effectiveness of
preference-based learning for specialized explanation tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种社交机器人辅助系统，通过透明化的概念瓶颈模型分析多模态会议数据，帮助促进团队会议中的目标设定和社交关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决团队会议中促进个体目标执行和社交关系的挑战，同时减轻主持人的认知负担，避免使用不透明的黑箱模型。

Method: 采用基于人类可解释概念（如参与度和情感）的代理概念瓶颈模型（CBM），并通过迁移学习框架将基础模型的广泛社交理解能力蒸馏到CBM中。

Result: 该系统在预测干预需求方面显著优于零样本基础模型，并能实时修正推理，且能跨组推广和将专家知识传递给新手。

Conclusion: 通过将专家认知模型转化为可解释的机器人伙伴，为复杂社交领域中增强人类能力提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Successful group meetings, such as those implemented in group
behavioral-change programs, work meetings, and other social contexts, must
promote individual goal setting and execution while strengthening the social
relationships within the group. Consequently, an ideal facilitator must be
sensitive to the subtle dynamics of disengagement, difficulties with individual
goal setting and execution, and interpersonal difficulties that signal a need
for intervention. The challenges and cognitive load experienced by facilitators
create a critical gap for an embodied technology that can interpret social
exchanges while remaining aware of the needs of the individuals in the group
and providing transparent recommendations that go beyond powerful but "black
box" foundation models (FMs) that identify social cues. We address this
important demand with a social robot co-facilitator that analyzes multimodal
meeting data and provides discreet cues to the facilitator. The robot's
reasoning is powered by an agentic concept bottleneck model (CBM), which makes
decisions based on human-interpretable concepts like participant engagement and
sentiments, ensuring transparency and trustworthiness. Our core contribution is
a transfer learning framework that distills the broad social understanding of
an FM into our specialized and transparent CBM. This concept-driven system
significantly outperforms direct zero-shot FMs in predicting the need for
intervention and enables real-time human correction of its reasoning.
Critically, we demonstrate robust knowledge transfer: the model generalizes
across different groups and successfully transfers the expertise of senior
human facilitators to improve the performance of novices. By transferring an
expert's cognitive model into an interpretable robotic partner, our work
provides a powerful blueprint for augmenting human capabilities in complex
social domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HarmonyGuard是一个多智能体协作框架，通过策略增强和双目标优化，在开放网络环境中同时提升任务效用和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究局限于单目标优化或单轮场景，无法在网络环境中协同优化安全性和效用。

Method: 提出HarmonyGuard框架，包含策略代理（自适应提取和更新安全策略）和效用代理（实时推理和优化双目标）。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，HarmonyGuard的策略合规性提升38%，任务完成率提升20%，且所有任务中策略合规性超过90%。

Conclusion: HarmonyGuard有效解决了网络环境中安全性与效用的协同优化问题。

Abstract: Large language models enable agents to autonomously perform tasks in open web
environments. However, as hidden threats within the web evolve, web agents face
the challenge of balancing task performance with emerging risks during
long-sequence operations. Although this challenge is critical, current research
remains limited to single-objective optimization or single-turn scenarios,
lacking the capability for collaborative optimization of both safety and
utility in web environments. To address this gap, we propose HarmonyGuard, a
multi-agent collaborative framework that leverages policy enhancement and
objective optimization to jointly improve both utility and safety. HarmonyGuard
features a multi-agent architecture characterized by two fundamental
capabilities: (1) Adaptive Policy Enhancement: We introduce the Policy Agent
within HarmonyGuard, which automatically extracts and maintains structured
security policies from unstructured external documents, while continuously
updating policies in response to evolving threats. (2) Dual-Objective
Optimization: Based on the dual objectives of safety and utility, the Utility
Agent integrated within HarmonyGuard performs the Markovian real-time reasoning
to evaluate the objectives and utilizes metacognitive capabilities for their
optimization. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks show that
HarmonyGuard improves policy compliance by up to 38% and task completion by up
to 20% over existing baselines, while achieving over 90% policy compliance
across all tasks. Our project is available here:

TL;DR: SMEdit是一种新的元学习模型编辑方法，通过多步反向传播和权重更新正则化，解决了低数据场景下的性能问题和训练效率瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的静态特性导致知识更新成本高，现有元学习模型编辑方法（MLBME）在低数据场景下表现不佳且训练效率受限。

Method: 提出SMEdit方法，采用多步反向传播（MBPS）和权重更新正则化，提升低数据下的编辑性能和训练效率。

Result: 在两个数据集和两种LLMs上的实验表明，SMEdit优于现有MLBME方法，且MBPS策略可无缝集成到其他方法中。

Conclusion: SMEdit通过改进编辑性能和训练效率，为LLMs的动态知识更新提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) underpin many AI applications, but their static
nature makes updating knowledge costly. Model editing offers an efficient
alternative by injecting new information through targeted parameter
modifications. In particular, meta-learning-based model editing (MLBME) methods
have demonstrated notable advantages in both editing effectiveness and
efficiency. Despite this, we find that MLBME exhibits suboptimal performance in
low-data scenarios, and its training efficiency is bottlenecked by the
computation of KL divergence. To address these, we propose $\textbf{S}$tep
$\textbf{M}$ore $\textbf{Edit}$ ($\textbf{SMEdit}$), a novel MLBME method that
adopts $\textbf{M}$ultiple $\textbf{B}$ackpro$\textbf{P}$agation
$\textbf{S}$teps ($\textbf{MBPS}$) to improve editing performance under limited
supervision and a norm regularization on weight updates to improve training
efficiency. Experimental results on two datasets and two LLMs demonstrate that
SMEdit outperforms prior MLBME baselines and the MBPS strategy can be
seamlessly integrated into existing methods to further boost their performance.
Our code will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ZARA是一个基于代理的零样本、可解释的人体活动识别框架，直接从原始运动时间序列中提取特征，无需微调或任务特定分类器，性能优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要针对固定活动集进行训练，且在新行为或传感器设置出现时需要昂贵重新训练，而基于大语言模型的方法准确率有限且缺乏可验证的解释性。

Method: ZARA通过自动生成的特征知识库、多传感器检索模块和分层代理流程，指导大语言模型迭代选择特征、提取证据并生成预测和自然语言解释。

Result: 在8个HAR基准测试中，ZARA实现了零样本SOTA性能，宏观F1得分比最强基线高出2.53倍，并通过消融研究验证了各模块的必要性。

Conclusion: ZARA为可信赖的即插即用运动时间序列分析提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Motion sensor time-series are central to human activity recognition (HAR),
with applications in health, sports, and smart devices. However, existing
methods are trained for fixed activity sets and require costly retraining when
new behaviours or sensor setups appear. Recent attempts to use large language
models (LLMs) for HAR, typically by converting signals into text or images,
suffer from limited accuracy and lack verifiable interpretability. We propose
ZARA, the first agent-based framework for zero-shot, explainable HAR directly
from raw motion time-series. ZARA integrates an automatically derived pair-wise
feature knowledge base that captures discriminative statistics for every
activity pair, a multi-sensor retrieval module that surfaces relevant evidence,
and a hierarchical agent pipeline that guides the LLM to iteratively select
features, draw on this evidence, and produce both activity predictions and
natural-language explanations. ZARA enables flexible and interpretable HAR
without any fine-tuning or task-specific classifiers. Extensive experiments on
8 HAR benchmarks show that ZARA achieves SOTA zero-shot performance, delivering
clear reasoning while exceeding the strongest baselines by 2.53x in macro F1.
Ablation studies further confirm the necessity of each module, marking ZARA as
a promising step toward trustworthy, plug-and-play motion time-series analysis.

TL;DR: 研究表明，大型推理模型（LRMs）的劝说能力简化了AI模型的越狱（jailbreaking），使其成为非专家也能进行的低成本活动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统越狱方法需要复杂技术或专业知识，本研究探索LRMs如何简化这一过程。

Method: 评估四种LRMs（DeepSeek-R1、Gemini 2.5 Flash、Grok 3 Mini、Qwen3 235B）作为自主对手，通过多轮对话攻击九种目标模型。

Result: 在70个有害提示的基准测试中，总体攻击成功率达97.14%。

Conclusion: LRMs能系统性削弱其他模型的安全防护，亟需进一步对齐前沿模型以抵御和防止其被用作越狱工具。

Abstract: Jailbreaking -- bypassing built-in safety mechanisms in AI models -- has
traditionally required complex technical procedures or specialized human
expertise. In this study, we show that the persuasive capabilities of large
reasoning models (LRMs) simplify and scale jailbreaking, converting it into an
inexpensive activity accessible to non-experts. We evaluated the capabilities
of four LRMs (DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Grok 3 Mini, Qwen3 235B) to act as
autonomous adversaries conducting multi-turn conversations with nine widely
used target models. LRMs received instructions via a system prompt, before
proceeding to planning and executing jailbreaks with no further supervision. We
performed extensive experiments with a benchmark of harmful prompts composed of
70 items covering seven sensitive domains. This setup yielded an overall attack
success rate across all model combinations of 97.14%. Our study reveals an
alignment regression, in which LRMs can systematically erode the safety
guardrails of other models, highlighting the urgent need to further align
frontier models not only to resist jailbreak attempts, but also to prevent them
from being co-opted into acting as jailbreak agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控文本生成方法在短序列上表现良好，但在长文本生成中可控性下降，主要原因是前缀注意力衰减。

Method: 提出DTPA框架，动态选择最优前缀类型并指数级放大前缀注意力，同时可选增强原始提示以平衡文本质量。

Result: 实验表明DTPA在多个可控文本生成任务中优于其他方法，尤其在长文本生成中表现突出。

Conclusion: DTPA是一种轻量且有效的框架，显著提升了长文本生成的可控性，同时保持了文本的流畅性和多样性。

Abstract: Controllable Text Generation (CTG) is a vital subfield in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), aiming to generate text that aligns with desired attributes.
However, previous studies commonly focus on the quality of controllable text
generation for short sequences, while the generation of long-form text remains
largely underexplored. In this paper, we observe that the controllability of
texts generated by the powerful prefix-based method Air-Decoding tends to
decline with increasing sequence length, which we hypothesize primarily arises
from the observed decay in attention to the prefixes. Meanwhile, different
types of prefixes including soft and hard prefixes are also key factors
influencing performance. Building on these insights, we propose a lightweight
and effective framework called Dynamic Token-level Prefix Augmentation (DTPA)
based on Air-Decoding for controllable text generation. Specifically, it first
selects the optimal prefix type for a given task. Then we dynamically amplify
the attention to the prefix for the attribute distribution to enhance
controllability, with a scaling factor growing exponentially as the sequence
length increases. Moreover, based on the task, we optionally apply a similar
augmentation to the original prompt for the raw distribution to balance text
quality. After attribute distribution reconstruction, the generated text
satisfies the attribute constraints well. Experiments on multiple CTG tasks
demonstrate that DTPA generally outperforms other methods in attribute control
while maintaining competitive fluency, diversity, and topic relevance. Further
analysis highlights DTPA's superior effectiveness in long text generation.

TL;DR: PAIRS是一个无需训练的双路径框架，通过自适应决定是否检索和选择外部信息，显著提升RAG系统的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG系统存在效率低下和检索不相关文档的问题，PAIRS旨在解决这些局限性。

Method: PAIRS采用双路径生成机制，结合参数化知识和检索知识，自适应决定是否检索，并通过加权相似度过滤文档。

Result: 在六个QA基准测试中，PAIRS减少25%的检索成本，同时提升1.1% EM和1.0% F1。

Conclusion: PAIRS通过自适应检索和选择机制，显著提升了RAG系统的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a cornerstone technique for
enhancing large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. However,
current RAG systems face two critical limitations: (1) they inefficiently
retrieve information for every query, including simple questions that could be
resolved using the LLM's parametric knowledge alone, and (2) they risk
retrieving irrelevant documents when queries contain sparse information
signals. To address these gaps, we introduce Parametric-verified Adaptive
Information Retrieval and Selection (PAIRS), a training-free framework that
integrates parametric and retrieved knowledge to adaptively determine whether
to retrieve and how to select external information. Specifically, PAIRS employs
a dual-path generation mechanism: First, the LLM produces both a direct answer
and a context-augmented answer using self-generated pseudo-context. When these
outputs converge, PAIRS bypasses external retrieval entirely, dramatically
improving the RAG system's efficiency. For divergent cases, PAIRS activates a
dual-path retrieval (DPR) process guided by both the original query and
self-generated contextual signals, followed by an Adaptive Information
Selection (AIS) module that filters documents through weighted similarity to
both sources. This simple yet effective approach can not only enhance
efficiency by eliminating unnecessary retrievals but also improve accuracy
through contextually guided retrieval and adaptive information selection.
Experimental results on six question-answering (QA) benchmarks show that PAIRS
reduces retrieval costs by around 25% (triggering for only 75% of queries)
while still improving accuracy-achieving +1.1% EM and +1.0% F1 over prior
baselines on average.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a milestone in the field of

large-scale deployment remains constrained by the need for significant
computational resources. This work proposes starting from a base model to
explore and combine data processing and careful data selection techniques,
training strategies, and architectural adjustments to improve the efficiency of
LLMs in resource-constrained environments and within a delimited knowledge
base. The methodological approach included defining criteria for building
reliable datasets, conducting controlled experiments with different
configurations, and systematically evaluating the resulting variants in terms
of capability, versatility, response time, and safety. Finally, comparative
tests were conducted to measure the performance of the developed variants and
to validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies. This work is based on
the master's thesis in Systems and Computer Engineering titled "Efficient

Conclusion: ToolGrad方法在数据集生成和模型性能上均优于传统方法，具有显著优势。

Abstract: Prior work synthesizes tool-use LLM datasets by first generating a user
query, followed by complex tool-use annotations like DFS. This leads to
inevitable annotation failures and low efficiency in data generation. We
introduce ToolGrad, an agentic framework that inverts this paradigm. ToolGrad
first constructs valid tool-use chains through an iterative process guided by
textual "gradients", and then synthesizes corresponding user queries. This
"answer-first" approach led to ToolGrad-5k, a dataset generated with more
complex tool use, lower cost, and 100% pass rate. Experiments show that models
trained on ToolGrad-5k outperform those on expensive baseline datasets and
proprietary LLMs, even on OOD benchmarks.

Result: 在多个多模态数学基准测试中取得最优结果，仅需20K训练样本即显著提升模型性能。

Conclusion: GM-PRM通过主动纠正和解释性分析，为多模态数学推理提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities
but often struggle with complex, multi-step mathematical reasoning, where minor
errors in visual perception or logical deduction can lead to complete failure.
While Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer step-by-step supervision, existing
multimodal PRMs are limited to being binary verifiers that can identify but not
correct errors, offering little explanatory power. To address these
deficiencies, we introduce the Generative Multimodal Process Reward Model
(GM-PRM), a novel paradigm that transforms the PRM from a passive judge into an
active reasoning collaborator. Instead of a simple scalar score, GM-PRM
provides a fine-grained, interpretable analysis of each reasoning step,
evaluating its step intent, visual alignment, and logical soundness. More
critically, GM-PRM is trained to generate a corrected version of the first
erroneous step it identifies. This unique corrective capability enables our new
test-time inference strategy, Refined Best-of-N (Refined-BoN). This framework
actively enhances solution quality by using the PRM's generated correction to
guide the policy model toward a more promising reasoning trajectory, thereby
improving the diversity and correctness of the solution pool. We demonstrate
that GM-PRM achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple multimodal math
benchmarks, significantly boosting policy model performance with remarkable
data efficiency, requiring only a 20K-sample training dataset. Our code will be
released upon acceptance.

Method: 通过实验分析不同任务、模型和微调方法下的LLM微调过程，研究过度记忆的条件和表现。

Result: 过度记忆现象广泛存在，导致模型鲁棒性下降、泛化能力差和生成多样性减少。

Conclusion: 研究强调LLM的学习动态与传统模型不同，并提出了微调时检查点和学习率选择的建议。

Abstract: The pretrained large language models (LLMs) are finetuned with labeled data
for better instruction following ability and alignment with human values. In
this paper, we study the learning dynamics of LLM finetuning on reasoning tasks
and reveal the uncovered over-memorization phenomenon during a specific stage
of LLM finetuning. At this stage, the LLMs have excessively memorized training
data and exhibit high test perplexity while maintaining good test accuracy. We
investigate the conditions that lead to LLM over-memorization and find that
training epochs and large learning rates contribute to this issue. Although
models with over-memorization demonstrate comparable test accuracy to normal
models, they suffer from reduced robustness, poor out-of-distribution
generalization, and decreased generation diversity. Our experiments unveil the
over-memorization to be broadly applicable across different tasks, models, and
finetuning methods. Our research highlights that overparameterized, extensively
finetuned LLMs exhibit unique learning dynamics distinct from traditional
machine learning models. Based on our observations of over-memorization, we
provide recommendations on checkpoint and learning rate selection during
finetuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大量昂贵的偏好数据集，缺乏高质量数据选择策略。

Result: 在多个数据集和对齐任务中优于五个基线方法，仅用10%数据实现更优性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源有限条件下扩展LLM对齐提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is a critical
challenge in AI research. While methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) are widely used, they
often rely on large, costly preference datasets. The current work lacks methods
for high-quality data selection specifically for preference data. In this work,
we introduce a novel difficulty-based data selection strategy for preference
datasets, grounded in the DPO implicit reward mechanism. By selecting
preference data examples with smaller DPO implicit reward gaps, which are
indicative of more challenging cases, we improve data efficiency and model
alignment. Our approach consistently outperforms five strong baselines across
multiple datasets and alignment tasks, achieving superior performance with only
10\% of the original data. This principled, efficient selection method offers a
promising solution for scaling LLM alignment with limited resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管近年来的主观评估表明TTS技术快速进步，但当前系统是否能在类似图灵测试的评估中真正欺骗人类仍存疑。

Method: 引入HFR指标，对开源和商业TTS模型进行大规模评估，分析其在欺骗测试中的表现。

Result: 发现CMOS声称的人类水平在欺骗测试中常失败，商业模型在零样本设置中接近人类水平，而开源系统在自然对话语音上仍有不足。

Conclusion: 强调需要更现实、以人为中心的评估方法，以补充现有主观测试。

Abstract: While subjective evaluations in recent years indicate rapid progress in TTS,
can current TTS systems truly pass a human deception test in a Turing-like
evaluation? We introduce Human Fooling Rate (HFR), a metric that directly
measures how often machine-generated speech is mistaken for human. Our
large-scale evaluation of open-source and commercial TTS models reveals
critical insights: (i) CMOS-based claims of human parity often fail under
deception testing, (ii) TTS progress should be benchmarked on datasets where
human speech achieves high HFRs, as evaluating against monotonous or less
expressive reference samples sets a low bar, (iii) Commercial models approach
human deception in zero-shot settings, while open-source systems still struggle
with natural conversational speech; (iv) Fine-tuning on high-quality data
improves realism but does not fully bridge the gap. Our findings underscore the
need for more realistic, human-centric evaluations alongside existing

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中表现优异，但存在幻觉问题，即生成与输入不一致的输出。

Method: 通过因果分析，提出了一种基于因果完备性的强化学习框架，结合因果充分性和必要性，定义令牌级因果完备性奖励。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法有效减少了幻觉问题。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在多模态大语言模型中显著减少了幻觉问题，提升了生成准确性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across vision-language tasks. However, they may suffer from
hallucinations--generating outputs that are semantically inconsistent with the
input image or text. Through causal analyses, we find that: (i) hallucinations
with omission may arise from the failure to adequately capture essential causal
factors, and (ii) hallucinations with fabrication are likely caused by the
model being misled by non-causal cues. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel reinforcement learning framework guided by causal completeness, which
jointly considers both causal sufficiency and causal necessity of tokens.
Specifically, we evaluate each token's standalone contribution and
counterfactual indispensability to define a token-level causal completeness
reward. This reward is used to construct a causally informed advantage function
within the GRPO optimization framework, encouraging the model to focus on
tokens that are both causally sufficient and necessary for accurate generation.
Experimental results across various benchmark datasets and tasks demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach, which effectively mitigates hallucinations
in MLLMs.

Motivation: 深度研究的范围和与其他推理密集型问题的区别尚未明确，需要正式定义和评估方法。

Method: 通过中间输出表示定义DR任务，分离推理挑战与报告生成，并构建包含100个任务的基准LiveDRBench。

Result: OpenAI模型表现最佳（F1=0.55），其他系统F1得分在0.02-0.72之间。分析揭示了当前系统的搜索机制和推理分布。

Conclusion: 论文为深度研究提供了正式定义和评估基准，揭示了当前系统的局限性，为未来改进搜索机制和基础能力提供了方向。

Abstract: Information tasks such as writing surveys or analytical reports require
complex search and reasoning, and have recently been grouped under the umbrella
of \textit{deep research} -- a term also adopted by recent models targeting
these capabilities. Despite growing interest, the scope of the deep research
task remains underdefined and its distinction from other reasoning-intensive
problems is poorly understood. In this paper, we propose a formal
characterization of the deep research (DR) task and introduce a benchmark to
evaluate the performance of DR systems. We argue that the core defining feature
of deep research is not the production of lengthy report-style outputs, but
rather the high fan-out over concepts required during the search process, i.e.,
broad and reasoning-intensive exploration. To enable objective evaluation, we
define DR using an intermediate output representation that encodes key claims
uncovered during search-separating the reasoning challenge from surface-level
report generation. Based on this formulation, we propose a diverse, challenging
benchmark LiveDRBench with 100 challenging tasks over scientific topics (e.g.,
datasets, materials discovery, prior art search) and public interest events
(e.g., flight incidents, movie awards). Across state-of-the-art DR systems, F1
score ranges between 0.02 and 0.72 for any sub-category. OpenAI's model
performs the best with an overall F1 score of 0.55. Analysis of reasoning
traces reveals the distribution over the number of referenced sources,
branching, and backtracking events executed by current DR systems, motivating
future directions for improving their search mechanisms and grounding
capabilities. The benchmark is available at
https://github.com/microsoft/LiveDRBench.

*Siddhant Panpatil,Hiskias Dingeto,Haon Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，即使采用先进的校准技术，语言模型仍易受精心设计的对话场景攻击，导致多种形式的校准失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索当前语言模型在校准方面的漏洞，尤其是在叙事沉浸、情感压力和策略性框架下的表现。

Method: 通过手动红队测试发现10种攻击场景，并开发自动化评估框架MISALIGNMENTBENCH进行跨模型验证。

Result: 测试显示，前沿语言模型的平均漏洞率为76%，其中GPT-4.1最易受攻击（90%），Claude-4-Sonnet表现最佳（40%）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前校准策略的不足，强调了未来AI系统需增强对复杂对话场景的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in alignment techniques, we demonstrate that
state-of-the-art language models remain vulnerable to carefully crafted
conversational scenarios that can induce various forms of misalignment without
explicit jailbreaking. Through systematic manual red-teaming with
Claude-4-Opus, we discovered 10 successful attack scenarios, revealing
fundamental vulnerabilities in how current alignment methods handle narrative
immersion, emotional pressure, and strategic framing. These scenarios
successfully elicited a range of misaligned behaviors, including deception,
value drift, self-preservation, and manipulative reasoning, each exploiting
different psychological and contextual vulnerabilities. To validate
generalizability, we distilled our successful manual attacks into
MISALIGNMENTBENCH, an automated evaluation framework that enables reproducible
testing across multiple models. Cross-model evaluation of our 10 scenarios
against five frontier LLMs revealed an overall 76% vulnerability rate, with
significant variations: GPT-4.1 showed the highest susceptibility (90%), while
Claude-4-Sonnet demonstrated greater resistance (40%). Our findings demonstrate
that sophisticated reasoning capabilities often become attack vectors rather
than protective mechanisms, as models can be manipulated into complex
justifications for misaligned behavior. This work provides (i) a detailed
taxonomy of conversational manipulation patterns and (ii) a reusable evaluation
framework. Together, these findings expose critical gaps in current alignment
strategies and highlight the need for robustness against subtle, scenario-based
manipulation in future AI systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种诊断框架，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在低资源、文化多元背景下对情感分析的表现，揭示了模型推理质量的显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NLP方法在低资源、文化多元的情感分析中表现不佳，因此需要一种更灵活、文化敏感的方法。

Method: 结合人工标注数据、情感反转反事实和基于规则的评估，评估LLMs在WhatsApp消息中的表现。

Result: 顶级LLMs表现出稳定的解释能力，而开源模型在模糊或情感变化时表现较差。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在复杂现实沟通中需要文化敏感、推理感知的AI评估。

Abstract: Sentiment analysis in low-resource, culturally nuanced contexts challenges
conventional NLP approaches that assume fixed labels and universal affective
expressions. We present a diagnostic framework that treats sentiment as a
context-dependent, culturally embedded construct, and evaluate how large
language models (LLMs) reason about sentiment in informal, code-mixed WhatsApp
messages from Nairobi youth health groups. Using a combination of
human-annotated data, sentiment-flipped counterfactuals, and rubric-based
explanation evaluation, we probe LLM interpretability, robustness, and
alignment with human reasoning. Framing our evaluation through a social-science
measurement lens, we operationalize and interrogate LLMs outputs as an
instrument for measuring the abstract concept of sentiment. Our findings reveal
significant variation in model reasoning quality, with top-tier LLMs
demonstrating interpretive stability, while open models often falter under
ambiguity or sentiment shifts. This work highlights the need for culturally
sensitive, reasoning-aware AI evaluation in complex, real-world communication.

TL;DR: 提出了ReasoningGuard，一种用于大型推理模型（LRMs）的推理时安全防护机制，通过及时注入安全提示来引导无害且有用的推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御机制依赖昂贵的微调和额外专家知识，限制了其可扩展性，而LRMs在推理过程中仍易受有害内容生成的影响。

Method: 利用模型的内部注意力行为，准确识别推理路径中的关键点，并触发安全导向的自发反思；在解码阶段采用缩放采样策略选择最优推理路径。

Result: ReasoningGuard有效缓解了三类越狱攻击，包括针对LRMs推理过程的最新攻击，优于七种现有防护机制。

Conclusion: ReasoningGuard以最小的额外推理成本实现了最先进的安全防御，同时避免了常见的安全过度问题。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in
reasoning-intensive tasks, but they remain vulnerable to harmful content
generation, particularly in the mid-to-late steps of their reasoning processes.
Existing defense mechanisms, however, rely on costly fine-tuning and additional
expert knowledge, which restricts their scalability. In this work, we propose
ReasoningGuard, an inference-time safeguard for LRMs, which injects timely
safety aha moments to steer harmless while helpful reasoning processes.
Leveraging the model's internal attention behavior, our approach accurately
identifies critical points in the reasoning path, and triggers spontaneous,
safety-oriented reflection. To safeguard both the subsequent reasoning steps
and the final answers, we further implement a scaling sampling strategy during
the decoding phase, selecting the optimal reasoning path. Inducing minimal
extra inference cost, ReasoningGuard effectively mitigates three types of
jailbreak attacks, including the latest ones targeting the reasoning process of
LRMs. Our approach outperforms seven existing safeguards, achieving
state-of-the-art safety defenses while effectively avoiding the common
exaggerated safety issues.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了使用黑盒大语言模型（LLMs）进行层次文本分类（HTC）的可行性，比较了三种提示策略在零样本和少样本设置下的表现，发现少样本设置能提高准确性，但需权衡计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决HTC中数据稀缺和模型复杂性的问题，探索LLMs作为传统机器学习方法的替代方案。

Method: 评估三种提示策略（DL、DH、TMH）在零样本和少样本设置下的表现，比较准确性和成本效益。

Result: 少样本设置提高准确性；LLMs在深层标签层次上表现优于传统模型，但API成本较高。

Conclusion: 黑盒LLMs在HTC中具有潜力，但需谨慎选择提示策略以平衡性能和成本。

Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) aims to assign texts to structured
label hierarchies; however, it faces challenges due to data scarcity and model
complexity. This study explores the feasibility of using black box Large
Language Models (LLMs) accessed via APIs for HTC, as an alternative to
traditional machine learning methods that require extensive labeled data and
computational resources. We evaluate three prompting strategies -- Direct Leaf
Label Prediction (DL), Direct Hierarchical Label Prediction (DH), and Top-down
Multi-step Hierarchical Label Prediction (TMH) -- in both zero-shot and
few-shot settings, comparing the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of these
strategies. Experiments on two datasets show that a few-shot setting
consistently improves classification accuracy compared to a zero-shot setting.
While a traditional machine learning model achieves high accuracy on a dataset
with a shallow hierarchy, LLMs, especially DH strategy, tend to outperform the
machine learning model on a dataset with a deeper hierarchy. API costs increase
significantly due to the higher input tokens required for deeper label
hierarchies on DH strategy. These results emphasize the trade-off between
accuracy improvement and the computational cost of prompt strategy. These
findings highlight the potential of black box LLMs for HTC while underscoring
the need to carefully select a prompt strategy to balance performance and cost.

TL;DR: DP-GPT4MTS是一种双提示大语言模型框架，通过结合显式提示和文本提示，有效整合时间戳文本信息，提升时间序列预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列预测模型忽视文本信息（如事件和新闻），影响预测准确性。现有单提示框架难以有效捕捉时间戳文本语义，引入冗余信息。

Method: 提出DP-GPT4MTS框架，结合显式提示（任务指令）和文本提示（上下文感知嵌入），通过自注意力和前馈网络优化嵌入。

Result: 在多样化文本-数值时间序列数据集上，DP-GPT4MTS优于现有最先进算法。

Conclusion: 双提示机制通过整合文本上下文，显著提升时间序列预测准确性。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is crucial in strategic planning and decision-making
across various industries. Traditional forecasting models mainly concentrate on
numerical time series data, often overlooking important textual information
such as events and news, which can significantly affect forecasting accuracy.
While large language models offer a promise for integrating multimodal data,
existing single-prompt frameworks struggle to effectively capture the semantics
of timestamped text, introducing redundant information that can hinder model
performance. To address this limitation, we introduce DP-GPT4MTS (Dual-Prompt
GPT2-base for Multimodal Time Series), a novel dual-prompt large language model
framework that combines two complementary prompts: an explicit prompt for clear
task instructions and a textual prompt for context-aware embeddings from
time-stamped data. The tokenizer generates the explicit prompt while the
embeddings from the textual prompt are refined through self-attention and
feed-forward networks. Comprehensive experiments conducted on diverse
textural-numerical time series datasets demonstrate that this approach
outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in time series forecasting. This
highlights the significance of incorporating textual context via a dual-prompt
mechanism to achieve more accurate time series predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理健康服务需求增长迅速，但真实训练数据不足，限制了抑郁症诊断的支持。现有模拟患者方法难以生成临床有效且多样化的症状表现。

Method: 利用先进语言模型，结合精神病诊断标准、症状严重程度量表和情境因素，开发了临床医生参与的模拟患者生成管道TalkDep。

Result: 通过临床专业人士的全面评估验证了模拟患者的可靠性，为自动抑郁症诊断系统提供了可扩展且适应性强的资源。

Conclusion: TalkDep生成的模拟患者能有效提升抑郁症诊断系统的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: The increasing demand for mental health services has outpaced the
availability of real training data to develop clinical professionals, leading
to limited support for the diagnosis of depression. This shortage has motivated
the development of simulated or virtual patients to assist in training and
evaluation, but existing approaches often fail to generate clinically valid,
natural, and diverse symptom presentations. In this work, we embrace the recent
advanced language models as the backbone and propose a novel
clinician-in-the-loop patient simulation pipeline, TalkDep, with access to
diversified patient profiles to develop simulated patients. By conditioning the
model on psychiatric diagnostic criteria, symptom severity scales, and
contextual factors, our goal is to create authentic patient responses that can
better support diagnostic model training and evaluation. We verify the
reliability of these simulated patients with thorough assessments conducted by
clinical professionals. The availability of validated simulated patients offers
a scalable and adaptable resource for improving the robustness and
generalisability of automatic depression diagnosis systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出KVSink方法，通过预测注意力下沉（attention sinks）来优化KV缓存量化，减少内存使用并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅保护前几个token的精度，未能全面解决注意力下沉问题，且其原理未充分理解。

Method: 研究注意力下沉的机制，提出KVSink方法预测下沉token，实现更全面的保护。

Result: KVSink优于现有PFN策略，提升困惑度（PPL）并减少对16位数值异常的依赖。

Conclusion: KVSink为KV缓存量化提供了更有效的解决方案，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: Key-Value (KV) cache quantization has become a widely adopted optimization
technique for efficient large language models (LLMs) inference by reducing KV
cache memory usage and mitigating memory-bound constraints. Recent studies have
emphasized the importance of preserving the original precision of KVs for the
first few tokens to ensure the protection of attention sinks. While this
approach has proven effective in mitigating performance degradation, its
underlying principles remain insufficiently understood. Moreover, it fails to
address the recent discovery that attention sinks can emerge beyond the initial
token positions. In this work, we elucidate the underlying mechanisms of
attention sinks during inference by examining their role in the cross-layer
evolution of extreme activation outliers. Additionally, we provide a
comprehensive analysis of the interplay between attention sinks and KV cache
quantization. Based on our enhanced understanding, we introduce
\textit{\textbf{KVSink}}, a plug-and-play method that effectively predicts sink
tokens with negligible overhead, enabling more thorough preservation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that KVSink outperforms the existing Preserve-First-N
(PFN) strategy, offering more effective preservation of attention sinks during
KV cache quantization. Moreover, when applied to the well-established KVQuant
method, KVSink further improves perplexity (PPL) and reduces reliance on 16-bit
numerical outliers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电子商务基准主要关注基本用户意图，而真实用户需求更复杂，因此需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 提出可扩展框架模拟用户指令，构建包含250万真实产品的交互式沙盒，并采用轨迹蒸馏和监督微调优化代理性能。

Result: 实验显示，即使是GPT-4.1等先进语言代理，在基准任务中的成功率也低于50%。优化后的代理性能接近GPT-4.1。

Conclusion: ShoppingBench为复杂购物意图提供了有效评估工具，并通过蒸馏策略显著提升了小型代理的性能。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks in e-commerce primarily focus on basic user intents, such
as finding or purchasing products. However, real-world users often pursue more
complex goals, such as applying vouchers, managing budgets, and finding
multi-products seller. To bridge this gap, we propose ShoppingBench, a novel
end-to-end shopping benchmark designed to encompass increasingly challenging
levels of grounded intent. Specifically, we propose a scalable framework to
simulate user instructions based on various intents derived from sampled
real-world products. To facilitate consistent and reliable evaluations, we
provide a large-scale shopping sandbox that serves as an interactive simulated
environment, incorporating over 2.5 million real-world products. Experimental
results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art language agents (such as
GPT-4.1) achieve absolute success rates under 50% on our benchmark tasks,
highlighting the significant challenges posed by our ShoppingBench. In
addition, we propose a trajectory distillation strategy and leverage supervised
fine-tuning, along with reinforcement learning on synthetic trajectories, to
distill the capabilities of a large language agent into a smaller one. As a
result, our trained agent achieves competitive performance compared to GPT-4.1.

TL;DR: GraphRAG通过知识图谱增强LLMs，但易受知识投毒攻击。本文提出两种攻击方法（TKPA和UKPA），成功率高且难以防御。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GraphRAG依赖LLMs从原始文本构建知识图谱，但这一过程可能被恶意操纵，植入误导信息。

Method: 提出两种知识投毒攻击（TKPA和UKPA），分别针对特定节点和全局结构进行攻击。

Result: TKPA成功率达93.1%，UKPA仅修改0.05%文本即可使QA准确率从95%降至50%。现有防御方法无效。

Conclusion: GraphRAG管道在知识投毒攻击下存在严重安全漏洞，亟需进一步研究防御方法。

Abstract: Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has recently emerged as
a promising paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) by converting
raw text into structured knowledge graphs, improving both accuracy and
explainability. However, GraphRAG relies on LLMs to extract knowledge from raw
text during graph construction, and this process can be maliciously manipulated
to implant misleading information. Targeting this attack surface, we propose
two knowledge poisoning attacks (KPAs) and demonstrate that modifying only a
few words in the source text can significantly change the constructed graph,
poison the GraphRAG, and severely mislead downstream reasoning. The first
attack, named Targeted KPA (TKPA), utilizes graph-theoretic analysis to locate
vulnerable nodes in the generated graphs and rewrites the corresponding
narratives with LLMs, achieving precise control over specific
question-answering (QA) outcomes with a success rate of 93.1\%, while keeping
the poisoned text fluent and natural. The second attack, named Universal KPA
(UKPA), exploits linguistic cues such as pronouns and dependency relations to
disrupt the structural integrity of the generated graph by altering globally
influential words. With fewer than 0.05\% of full text modified, the QA
accuracy collapses from 95\% to 50\%. Furthermore, experiments show that
state-of-the-art defense methods fail to detect these attacks, highlighting
that securing GraphRAG pipelines against knowledge poisoning remains largely
unexplored.

Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型（LLM）医疗基准存在可靠性问题，缺乏临床实践关联性和安全性评估。

Method: 提出MedCheck框架，将基准开发分为五个阶段，并提供46项医学定制标准。对53个医疗LLM基准进行了实证评估。

Result: 发现普遍问题，如与临床实践脱节、数据完整性危机和安全性评估缺失。

Conclusion: MedCheck可作为诊断工具和指南，推动医疗AI评估的标准化和可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show significant potential in healthcare,
prompting numerous benchmarks to evaluate their capabilities. However, concerns
persist regarding the reliability of these benchmarks, which often lack
clinical fidelity, robust data management, and safety-oriented evaluation
metrics. To address these shortcomings, we introduce MedCheck, the first
lifecycle-oriented assessment framework specifically designed for medical
benchmarks. Our framework deconstructs a benchmark's development into five
continuous stages, from design to governance, and provides a comprehensive
checklist of 46 medically-tailored criteria. Using MedCheck, we conducted an
in-depth empirical evaluation of 53 medical LLM benchmarks. Our analysis
uncovers widespread, systemic issues, including a profound disconnect from
clinical practice, a crisis of data integrity due to unmitigated contamination
risks, and a systematic neglect of safety-critical evaluation dimensions like
model robustness and uncertainty awareness. Based on these findings, MedCheck
serves as both a diagnostic tool for existing benchmarks and an actionable
guideline to foster a more standardized, reliable, and transparent approach to
evaluating AI in healthcare.

Conclusion: 高质量数据和微调是关键，开源模型在特定任务中表现优异，半合成数据对性能提升有益。

Abstract: Previous work has demonstrated that AI methods for analysing scientific
literature benefit significantly from annotating sentences in papers according
to their rhetorical roles, such as research gaps, results, limitations,
extensions of existing methodologies, and others. Such representations also
have the potential to support the development of a new generation of systems
capable of producing high-quality literature reviews. However, achieving this
goal requires the definition of a relevant annotation schema and effective
strategies for large-scale annotation of the literature. This paper addresses
these challenges by 1) introducing a novel annotation schema specifically
designed to support literature review generation and 2) conducting a
comprehensive evaluation of a wide range of state-of-the-art large language
models (LLMs) in classifying rhetorical roles according to this schema. To this
end, we also present Sci-Sentence, a novel multidisciplinary benchmark
comprising 700 sentences manually annotated by domain experts and 2,240
sentences automatically labelled using LLMs. We evaluate 37 LLMs on this
benchmark, spanning diverse model families and sizes, using both zero-shot
learning and fine-tuning approaches. The experiments yield several novel
insights that advance the state of the art in this challenging domain. First,
the current generation of LLMs performs remarkably well on this task when
fine-tuned on high-quality data, achieving performance levels above 96\% F1.
Second, while large proprietary models like GPT-4o achieve the best results,
some lightweight open-source alternatives also demonstrate excellent
performance. Finally, enriching the training data with semi-synthetic examples
generated by LLMs proves beneficial, enabling small encoders to achieve robust
results and significantly enhancing the performance of several open decoder
models.

TL;DR: 论文提出动态熵加权方法（Dynamic Entropy Weighting），通过细粒度奖励分配提升强化学习在长链推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习（如GRPO）在长链推理任务中因粗粒度奖励分配（对所有token统一奖励）表现受限。

Method: 1) GTPO：为每个token分配熵加权奖励；2) GRPO-S：为每个序列分配基于平均token熵的奖励。

Result: 实验显示方法显著优于DAPO基线，熵加权机制是性能提升的关键。

Conclusion: 动态熵加权为模型深度推理提供了更优路径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with algorithms like Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) improves Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning, but is
limited by a coarse-grained credit assignment that applies a uniform reward to
all tokens in a sequence. This is a major flaw in long-chain reasoning tasks.
This paper solves this with \textbf{Dynamic Entropy Weighting}. Our core idea
is that high-entropy tokens in correct responses can guide the policy toward a
higher performance ceiling. This allows us to create more fine-grained reward
signals for precise policy updates via two ways: 1) \textbf{Group Token Policy
Optimization} (\textbf{GTPO}), we assigns a entropy-weighted reward to each
token for fine-grained credit assignment. 2) \textbf{Sequence-Level Group
Relative Policy Optimization} (\textbf{GRPO-S}), we assigns a entropy-weighted
reward to each sequence based on its average token entropy. Experiments show
our methods significantly outperform the strong DAPO baseline. The results
confirm that our entropy-weighting mechanism is the key driver of this
performance boost, offering a better path to enhance deep reasoning in models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在推理能力上虽有进步，但在多模态环境中仍需改进，模型需主动选择感知模态以应对复杂任务。

Method: 引入CoQ框架，通过动态生成问题引导模型选择相关感知模态，收集关键信息以支持推理。

Conclusion: CoQ框架在多模态任务中有效改善了模型的推理过程，增强了其与多样化任务的适应性。

Abstract: Reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs) have substantially
advanced through methods such as chain-of-thought and explicit step-by-step
explanations. However, these improvements have not yet fully transitioned to
multimodal contexts, where models must proactively decide which sensory
modalities such as vision, audio, or spatial perception to engage when
interacting with complex real-world environments. In this paper, we introduce
the Chain of Questions (CoQ) framework, a curiosity-driven reasoning approach
that encourages multimodal language models to dynamically generate targeted
questions regarding their surroundings. These generated questions guide the
model to selectively activate relevant modalities, thereby gathering critical
information necessary for accurate reasoning and response generation. We
evaluate our framework on a novel multimodal benchmark dataset, assembled by
integrating WebGPT, ScienceQA, AVSD, and ScanQA datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that our CoQ method improves a foundation model's ability to
effectively identify and integrate pertinent sensory information. This leads to
improved accuracy, interpretability, and alignment of the reasoning process
with diverse multimodal tasks.

*Xu Zhang,Mei Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了三种NLP模型（零样本开源大模型、微调Transformer和传统逻辑回归）在提升交通事故数据质量方面的表现，发现微调Transformer模型（如RoBERTa）在性能和效率上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过挖掘事故叙述数据，提升交通事故数据的质量，尤其是二次事故的识别能力。

Method: 使用16,656条手动审核的事故叙述数据（2015-2022），比较了零样本开源大模型、微调Transformer和逻辑回归三类模型的表现。

Result: 微调Transformer模型（RoBERTa）表现最优（F1-score:0.90，准确率:95%），零样本大模型（如LLaMA3:70B）表现接近但计算成本高，逻辑回归表现较差（F1:0.66）。

Conclusion: 微调Transformer模型在性能和效率上表现最佳，适合实际部署；同时，中等规模的大模型在性能和计算成本间提供了优化空间。

Abstract: This study evaluates advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to
enhance crash data quality by mining crash narratives, using secondary crash
identification in Kentucky as a case study. Drawing from 16,656 manually
reviewed narratives from 2015-2022, with 3,803 confirmed secondary crashes, we
compare three model classes: zero-shot open-source large language models (LLMs)
(LLaMA3:70B, DeepSeek-R1:70B, Qwen3:32B, Gemma3:27B); fine-tuned transformers
(BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, Longformer); and traditional logistic
regression as baseline. Models were calibrated on 2015-2021 data and tested on
1,771 narratives from 2022. Fine-tuned transformers achieved superior
performance, with RoBERTa yielding the highest F1-score (0.90) and accuracy
(95%). Zero-shot LLaMA3:70B reached a comparable F1 of 0.86 but required 139
minutes of inference; the logistic baseline lagged well behind (F1:0.66). LLMs
excelled in recall for some variants (e.g., GEMMA3:27B at 0.94) but incurred
high computational costs (up to 723 minutes for DeepSeek-R1:70B), while
fine-tuned models processed the test set in seconds after brief training.
Further analysis indicated that mid-sized LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1:32B) can
rival larger counterparts in performance while reducing runtime, suggesting
opportunities for optimized deployments. Results highlight trade-offs between
accuracy, efficiency, and data requirements, with fine-tuned transformer models
balancing precision and recall effectively on Kentucky data. Practical
deployment considerations emphasize privacy-preserving local deployment,
ensemble approaches for improved accuracy, and incremental processing for
scalability, providing a replicable scheme for enhancing crash-data quality
with advanced NLP.

*Vladimír Havlík*

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）的涌现能力，指出这些能力源于深度神经网络（DNNs）的非线性动态系统特性，而非简单的参数扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs的涌现能力，解决当代AI发展中‘创造而不理解’的认识论挑战。

Method: 通过理论分析和实证观察，研究DNNs的非线性、随机过程及其宏观行为与微观神经元活动的关系。

Result: 发现涌现能力源于高度敏感的非线性系统的复杂动态，而非仅参数扩展。

Conclusion: 理解LLMs需将DNNs视为受涌现普遍原则支配的复杂动态系统，类似物理、化学和生物学中的现象。

Abstract: The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generative tasks
has raised fundamental questions about the nature of their acquired
capabilities, which often appear to emerge unexpectedly without explicit
training. This paper examines the emergent properties of Deep Neural Networks
(DNNs) through both theoretical analysis and empirical observation, addressing
the epistemological challenge of "creation without understanding" that
characterises contemporary AI development. We explore how the neural approach's
reliance on nonlinear, stochastic processes fundamentally differs from symbolic
computational paradigms, creating systems whose macro-level behaviours cannot
be analytically derived from micro-level neuron activities. Through analysis of
scaling laws, grokking phenomena, and phase transitions in model capabilities,
I demonstrate that emergent abilities arise from the complex dynamics of highly
sensitive nonlinear systems rather than simply from parameter scaling alone. My
investigation reveals that current debates over metrics, pre-training loss
thresholds, and in-context learning miss the fundamental ontological nature of
emergence in DNNs. I argue that these systems exhibit genuine emergent
properties analogous to those found in other complex natural phenomena, where
systemic capabilities emerge from cooperative interactions among simple
components without being reducible to their individual behaviours. The paper
concludes that understanding LLM capabilities requires recognising DNNs as a
new domain of complex dynamical systems governed by universal principles of
emergence, similar to those operating in physics, chemistry, and biology. This
perspective shifts the focus from purely phenomenological definitions of
emergence to understanding the internal dynamic transformations that enable
these systems to acquire capabilities that transcend their individual
components.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类选择性听力以确定SDS中ASR所需的能力并评估其表现。

Method: 通过比较人类生成对话响应时的转录与参考转录，实验验证了选择性听力现象。

Result: 实验结果支持了人类选择性听力的存在，并提出了基于此的新ASR评估方法。

Conclusion: 利用人类选择性听力可以识别ASR系统与人类转录能力之间的差距，为ASR评估提供了新思路。

Abstract: Spoken dialogue systems (SDSs) utilize automatic speech recognition (ASR) at
the front end of their pipeline. The role of ASR in SDSs is to recognize
information in user speech related to response generation appropriately.
Examining selective listening of humans, which refers to the ability to focus
on and listen to important parts of a conversation during the speech, will
enable us to identify the ASR capabilities required for SDSs and evaluate them.
In this study, we experimentally confirmed selective listening when humans
generate dialogue responses by comparing human transcriptions for generating
dialogue responses and reference transcriptions. Based on our experimental
results, we discuss the possibility of a new ASR evaluation method that
leverages human selective listening, which can identify the gap between
transcription ability between ASR systems and humans.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少用户感知延迟（UPL），即用户在收到系统响应前的等待时间，是语音对话系统中的重要目标。

Method: 提出预测置信模型（PCM），通过比较预测的完整用户话语与实际话语的语义相似性，判断是否进行预取。

Result: 评估了PCM在预测与实际用户话语差异上的表现。

Conclusion: PCM能有效判断预取可行性，有助于降低UPL。

Abstract: Prefetching of dialogue responses has been investigated to reduce
user-perceived latency (UPL), which refers to the user's waiting time before
receiving the system's response, in spoken dialogue systems. To reduce the UPL,
it is necessary to predict complete user utterances before the end of the
user's speech, typically by language models, to prepare prefetched dialogue
responses. In this study, we proposed a prediction confidence model (PCM) that
determines whether prefetching is possible or not by estimating the semantic
similarity between the predicted complete user utterance and the complete user
utterance. We evaluated our PCM based on the differences between the predicted
complete user utterance and the complete user utterance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种客户支持对话（CSC）任务，旨在通过明确的策略训练客服代理，并构建了CSConv评估数据集和RoleCS训练数据集，实验证明基于RoleCS微调的LLM能生成更高质量的策略对齐响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话数据集缺乏策略指导，且真实服务数据难以获取和标注，因此需要一种结构化框架来提升客服对话质量。

Method: 基于COPC指南提出CSC框架，定义五个对话阶段和十二种策略；构建CSConv数据集和RoleCS训练数据集，采用角色扮演方法模拟策略丰富的对话。

Result: 实验表明，基于RoleCS微调的LLM在CSConv上生成更高质量的策略对齐响应，人类评估也证实问题解决能力提升。

Conclusion: CSC框架和相关数据集有效提升了客服对话质量，未来将公开代码和数据。

Abstract: Effective customer support requires not only accurate problem solving but
also structured and empathetic communication aligned with professional
standards. However, existing dialogue datasets often lack strategic guidance,
and real-world service data is difficult to access and annotate. To address
this, we introduce the task of Customer Support Conversation (CSC), aimed at
training customer service agents to respond using well-defined support
strategies. We propose a structured CSC framework grounded in COPC guidelines,
defining five conversational stages and twelve strategies to guide high-quality
interactions. Based on this, we construct CSConv, an evaluation dataset of
1,855 real-world customer-agent conversations rewritten using LLMs to reflect
deliberate strategy use, and annotated accordingly. Additionally, we develop a
role-playing approach that simulates strategy-rich conversations using
LLM-powered roles aligned with the CSC framework, resulting in the training
dataset RoleCS. Experiments show that fine-tuning strong LLMs on RoleCS
significantly improves their ability to generate high-quality, strategy-aligned
responses on CSConv. Human evaluations further confirm gains in problem
resolution. All code and data will be made publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动形式化方法准确率低，需同时掌握形式语言知识和自然语言推理能力。

Method: 构建两个数据集（形式知识丰富和推理轨迹生成），结合SFT和RLVR训练模型。

Result: 7B和32B模型表现优异，32B模型在FormalMATH-Lite和ProverBench上达到SOTA。

Conclusion: ThinkingF有效提升自动形式化的能力，为领域提供新方法。

Abstract: Autoformalization aims to translate natural-language mathematical statements
into a formal language. While LLMs have accelerated progress in this area,
existing methods still suffer from low accuracy. We identify two key abilities
for effective autoformalization: comprehensive mastery of formal-language
domain knowledge, and reasoning capability of natural language problem
understanding and informal-formal alignment. Without the former, a model cannot
identify the correct formal objects; without the latter, it struggles to
interpret real-world contexts and map them precisely into formal expressions.
To address these gaps, we introduce ThinkingF, a data synthesis and training
pipeline that improves both abilities. First, we construct two datasets: one by
distilling and selecting large-scale examples rich in formal knowledge, and
another by generating informal-to-formal reasoning trajectories guided by
expert-designed templates. We then apply SFT and RLVR with these datasets to
further fuse and refine the two abilities. The resulting 7B and 32B models
exhibit both comprehensive formal knowledge and strong informal-to-formal
reasoning. Notably, StepFun-Formalizer-32B achieves SOTA BEq@1 scores of 40.5%
on FormalMATH-Lite and 26.7% on ProverBench, surpassing all prior
general-purpose and specialized models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决马来西亚教育系统中高质量教育评估工具的缺乏问题，尤其是针对低资源语言（如马来语）的挑战。

Method: 使用GPT-4o生成马来语数学选择题，比较了四种方法：非基础提示（结构化和基础）和RAG方法（基于LangChain框架和手动实现）。

Result: RAG方法在课程对齐和事实有效性上显著优于非基础提示方法。

Conclusion: 研究提供了一种生成低资源语言教育内容的方法，并提出了实用的EdTech解决方案开发建议。

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for scalable and high-quality
educational assessment tools within the Malaysian education system. It
highlights the potential of Generative AI (GenAI) while acknowledging the
significant challenges of ensuring factual accuracy and curriculum alignment,
especially for low-resource languages like Bahasa Melayu. This research
introduces and compares four incremental pipelines for generating Form 1
Mathematics multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Bahasa Melayu using OpenAI's
GPT-4o. The methods range from non-grounded prompting (structured and basic) to
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches (one using the LangChain
framework, one implemented manually). The system is grounded in official
curriculum documents, including teacher-prepared notes and the yearly teaching
plan (RPT). A dual-pronged automated evaluation framework is employed to assess
the generated questions. Curriculum alignment is measured using Semantic
Textual Similarity (STS) against the RPT, while contextual validity is verified
through a novel RAG-based Question-Answering (RAG-QA) method. The results
demonstrate that RAG-based pipelines significantly outperform non-grounded
prompting methods, producing questions with higher curriculum alignment and
factual validity. The study further analyzes the trade-offs between the ease of
implementation of framework-based RAG and the fine-grained control offered by a
manual pipeline. This work presents a validated methodology for generating
curriculum-specific educational content in a low-resource language, introduces
a symbiotic RAG-QA evaluation technique, and provides actionable insights for
the development and deployment of practical EdTech solutions in Malaysia and
similar regions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Word-in-Context任务仅比较同一词的不同语境，限制了信息的捕捉范围，因此需要扩展到词间场景。

Method: 通过从SemCor数据中提取数据集，提出Concept Differentiation任务，并微调多个表示模型（CALE）。

Result: CALE模型在多种词汇语义任务中表现最佳，且微调显著改变了嵌入的空间组织。

Conclusion: CALE模型提供了高效的多用途词汇意义表示，扩展了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Lexical semantics is concerned with both the multiple senses a word can adopt
in different contexts, and the semantic relations that exist between meanings
of different words. To investigate them, Contextualized Language Models are a
valuable tool that provides context-sensitive representations that can be used
to investigate lexical meaning. Recent works like XL-LEXEME have leveraged the
task of Word-in-Context to fine-tune them to get more semantically accurate
representations, but Word-in-Context only compares occurrences of the same
lemma, limiting the range of captured information. In this paper, we propose an
extension, Concept Differentiation, to include inter-words scenarios. We
provide a dataset for this task, derived from SemCor data. Then we fine-tune
several representation models on this dataset. We call these models
Concept-Aligned Embeddings (CALE). By challenging our models and other models
on various lexical semantic tasks, we demonstrate that the proposed models
provide efficient multi-purpose representations of lexical meaning that reach
best performances in our experiments. We also show that CALE's fine-tuning
brings valuable changes to the spatial organization of embeddings.

Result: 实验表明，StyliTruth显著减少风格化导致的真实性下降，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: StyliTruth有效平衡风格与真实性，为细粒度输出控制提供新思路。

Abstract: Generating stylized large language model (LLM) responses via representation
editing is a promising way for fine-grained output control. However, there
exists an inherent trade-off: imposing a distinctive style often degrades
truthfulness. Existing representation editing methods, by naively injecting
style signals, overlook this collateral impact and frequently contaminate the
model's core truthfulness representations, resulting in reduced answer
correctness. We term this phenomenon stylization-induced truthfulness collapse.
We attribute this issue to latent coupling between style and truth directions
in certain key attention heads, and propose StyliTruth, a mechanism that
preserves stylization while keeping truthfulness intact. StyliTruth separates
the style-relevant and truth-relevant subspaces in the model's representation
space via an orthogonal deflation process. This decomposition enables
independent control of style and truth in their own subspaces, minimizing
interference. By designing adaptive, token-level steering vectors within each
subspace, we dynamically and precisely control the generation process to
maintain both stylistic fidelity and truthfulness. We validate our method on
multiple styles and languages. Extensive experiments and analyses show that
StyliTruth significantly reduces stylization-induced truthfulness collapse and
outperforms existing inference-time intervention methods in balancing style
adherence with truthfulness.

Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental disorder that affects millions worldwide.
While automated depression assessment shows promise, most studies rely on
limited or non-clinically validated data, and often prioritize complex model
design over real-world effectiveness. In this paper, we aim to unveil the
landscape of clinical depression assessment. We introduce C-MIND, a clinical
neuropsychiatric multimodal diagnosis dataset collected over two years from
real hospital visits. Each participant completes three structured psychiatric
tasks and receives a final diagnosis from expert clinicians, with informative
audio, video, transcript, and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
signals recorded. Using C-MIND, we first analyze behavioral signatures relevant
to diagnosis. We train a range of classical models to quantify how different
tasks and modalities contribute to diagnostic performance, and dissect the
effectiveness of their combinations. We then explore whether LLMs can perform
psychiatric reasoning like clinicians and identify their clear limitations in
realistic clinical settings. In response, we propose to guide the reasoning
process with clinical expertise and consistently improves LLM diagnostic
performance by up to 10% in Macro-F1 score. We aim to build an infrastructure
for clinical depression assessment from both data and algorithmic perspectives,
enabling C-MIND to facilitate grounded and reliable research for mental
healthcare.

Abstract: While AI agents show potential in scientific ideation, most existing
frameworks rely on single-agent refinement, limiting creativity due to bounded
knowledge and perspective. Inspired by real-world research dynamics, this paper
investigates whether structured multi-agent discussions can surpass solitary
ideation. We propose a cooperative multi-agent framework for generating
research proposals and systematically compare configurations including group
size, leaderled versus leaderless structures, and team compositions varying in
interdisciplinarity and seniority. To assess idea quality, we employ a
comprehensive protocol with agent-based scoring and human review across
dimensions such as novelty, strategic vision, and integration depth. Our
results show that multi-agent discussions substantially outperform solitary
baselines. A designated leader acts as a catalyst, transforming discussion into
more integrated and visionary proposals. Notably, we find that cognitive
diversity is a primary driver of quality, yet expertise is a non-negotiable
prerequisite, as teams lacking a foundation of senior knowledge fail to surpass
even a single competent agent. These findings offer actionable insights for
designing collaborative AI ideation systems and shed light on how team
structure influences creative outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）计算和内存需求高，现有压缩技术未充分探索层间冗余。

Method: 提出MASA框架，将注意力投影矩阵分解为共享字典原子，实现参数高效共享。

Result: 在100M-700M参数规模下，MASA优于GQA、低秩基线等方法，且适用于ViT。

Conclusion: MASA为参数高效模型提供可扩展方案，适用于预训练LLMs参数压缩。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, yet their
high computational and memory demands hinder their widespread deployment.
Existing compression techniques focus on intra-block optimizations (e.g.
low-rank approximation, attention head pruning), while the repetitive layered
structure of transformers implies significant inter-block redundancy - a
dimension largely unexplored beyond key-value (KV) caching. Inspired by
dictionary learning in CNNs, we propose a framework for structured weight
sharing across transformer layers. Our approach decomposes attention projection
matrices into shared dictionary atoms, reducing the attention module's
parameters by 66.7% while achieving on-par performance. Unlike complex methods
requiring distillation or architectural changes, MASA (Matrix Atom Sharing in
Attention) operates as a drop-in replacement - trained with standard optimizers
- and represents each layer's weights as linear combinations of shared matrix
atoms. Experiments across scales (100M-700M parameters) show that MASA achieves
better benchmark accuracy and perplexity than grouped-query attention (GQA),
low-rank baselines and recently proposed Repeat-all-over/Sequential sharing at
comparable parameter budgets. Ablation studies confirm robustness to the
dictionary size and the efficacy of shared representations in capturing
cross-layer statistical regularities. Extending to Vision Transformers (ViT),
MASA matches performance metrics on image classification and detection tasks
with 66.7% fewer attention parameters. By combining dictionary learning
strategies with transformer efficiency, MASA offers a scalable blueprint for
parameter-efficient models without sacrificing performance. Finally, we
investigate the possibility of employing MASA on pretrained LLMs to reduce
their number of parameters without experiencing any significant drop in their
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法无法满足实时需求和动态内容查询，如票务或库存信息，因此需要一种新的框架来结合静态和动态信息源。

Method: TURA包含三个关键组件：意图感知检索模块、基于DAG的任务规划器和轻量级代理执行器，用于高效调用工具和并行执行任务。

Result: TURA成功结合了静态RAG和动态信息源，满足了大规模工业系统的低延迟需求，服务于数百万用户。

Conclusion: TURA是首个系统性解决静态RAG与动态信息源之间差距的架构，为AI搜索产品提供了实时、强大的解决方案。

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) is transforming search engines
into conversational AI search products, primarily using Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) on web corpora. However, this paradigm has significant
industrial limitations. Traditional RAG approaches struggle with real-time
needs and structured queries that require accessing dynamically generated
content like ticket availability or inventory. Limited to indexing static
pages, search engines cannot perform the interactive queries needed for such
time-sensitive data. Academic research has focused on optimizing RAG for static
content, overlooking complex intents and the need for dynamic sources like
databases and real-time APIs. To bridge this gap, we introduce TURA
(Tool-Augmented Unified Retrieval Agent for AI Search), a novel three-stage
framework that combines RAG with agentic tool-use to access both static content
and dynamic, real-time information. TURA has three key components: an
Intent-Aware Retrieval module to decompose queries and retrieve information
sources encapsulated as Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers, a DAG-based Task
Planner that models task dependencies as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for
optimal parallel execution, and a lightweight Distilled Agent Executor for
efficient tool calling. TURA is the first architecture to systematically bridge
the gap between static RAG and dynamic information sources for a world-class AI
search product. Serving tens of millions of users, it leverages an agentic
framework to deliver robust, real-time answers while meeting the low-latency
demands of a large-scale industrial system.

Conclusion: 尽管资源限制影响了性能，但模块化流程支持未来改进，凸显了紧凑型Transformer在资源稀缺环境中的潜力。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL translation enables non-expert users to query relational
databases using natural language, with applications in education and business
intelligence. This study evaluates three lightweight transformer models -
T5-Small, BART-Small, and GPT-2 - on the Spider dataset, focusing on
low-resource settings. We developed a reusable, model-agnostic pipeline that
tailors schema formatting to each model's architecture, training them across
1000 to 5000 iterations and evaluating on 1000 test samples using Logical Form
Accuracy (LFAcc), BLEU, and Exact Match (EM) metrics. Fine-tuned T5-Small
achieves the highest LFAcc (27.8%), outperforming BART-Small (23.98%) and GPT-2
(20.1%), highlighting encoder-decoder models' superiority in schema-aware SQL
generation. Despite resource constraints limiting performance, our pipeline's
modularity supports future enhancements, such as advanced schema linking or
alternative base models. This work underscores the potential of compact
transformers for accessible text-to-SQL solutions in resource-scarce
environments.

TL;DR: P-Aligner是一种轻量级模块，用于生成更符合人类偏好的指令，提升大语言模型（LLMs）的安全性和有用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在交互中常因指令缺陷（如缺失上下文、模糊指示或不恰当语气）而无法与人类价值观对齐，亟需改进。

Method: 提出P-Aligner模块，基于UltraPrompt数据集（通过蒙特卡洛树搜索生成）训练，优化指令表达。

Result: P-Aligner在多种模型和基准测试中表现优异，平均胜率提升28.35%（GPT-4-turbo）和8.69%（Gemma-2-SimPO）。

Conclusion: P-Aligner高效且有效，验证了其在数据质量、搜索策略和部署效率上的优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are expected to produce safe, helpful, and
honest content during interaction with human users, but they frequently fail to
align with such values when given flawed instructions, e.g., missing context,
ambiguous directives, or inappropriate tone, leaving substantial room for
improvement along multiple dimensions. A cost-effective yet high-impact way is
to pre-align instructions before the model begins decoding. Existing approaches
either rely on prohibitive test-time search costs or end-to-end model rewrite,
which is powered by a customized training corpus with unclear objectives. In
this work, we demonstrate that the goal of efficient and effective preference
alignment can be achieved by P-Aligner, a lightweight module generating
instructions that preserve the original intents while being expressed in a more
human-preferred form. P-Aligner is trained on UltraPrompt, a new dataset
synthesized via a proposed principle-guided pipeline using Monte-Carlo Tree
Search, which systematically explores the space of candidate instructions that
are closely tied to human preference. Experiments across different methods show
that P-Aligner generally outperforms strong baselines across various models and
benchmarks, including average win-rate gains of 28.35% and 8.69% on GPT-4-turbo
and Gemma-2-SimPO, respectively. Further analyses validate its effectiveness
and efficiency through multiple perspectives, including data quality, search
strategies, iterative deployment, and time overhead.

TL;DR: IFDecorator框架通过改进RLVR的训练效率和对齐意图，显著提升了LLMs的指令遵循能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR在提升LLMs指令遵循能力时存在训练效率低和意图对齐不足的问题。

Method: IFDecorator包含三个组件：数据飞轮、IntentCheck模块和诊断机制trip wires。

Result: Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-IFDecorator在IFEval上达到87.43%准确率，优于GPT-4o，且在FollowBench上表现优异。

Conclusion: IFDecorator有效解决了RLVR的不足，并提供了可复现的研究资源。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) improves instruction
following capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but suffers from
training inefficiency due to inadequate difficulty assessment. Moreover, RLVR
is prone to over-optimization, where LLMs exploit verification shortcuts
without aligning to the actual intent of user instructions. We introduce
Instruction Following Decorator (IFDecorator}, a framework that wraps RLVR
training into a robust and sample-efficient pipeline. It consists of three
components: (1) a cooperative-adversarial data flywheel that co-evolves
instructions and hybrid verifications, generating progressively more
challenging instruction-verification pairs; (2) IntentCheck, a bypass module
enforcing intent alignment; and (3) trip wires, a diagnostic mechanism that
detects reward hacking via trap instructions, which trigger and capture
shortcut exploitation behaviors. Our Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-IFDecorator achieves
87.43% accuracy on IFEval, outperforming larger proprietary models such as
GPT-4o. Additionally, we demonstrate substantial improvements on FollowBench
while preserving general capabilities. Our trip wires show significant
reductions in reward hacking rates. We will release models, code, and data for
future research.

Motivation: 研究动机是探讨NLP领域中反仇恨言论研究的现状，特别是利益相关者参与对数据集创建、模型开发和评估的影响。

Method: 方法包括对74项NLP研究的系统综述，以及与5个专注于在线性别暴力（oGBV）的非政府组织进行的参与式案例研究。

Result: 研究发现当前NLP研究与受在线有毒内容影响的社区需求之间存在日益扩大的脱节。

Conclusion: 结论提出具体建议，强调在反仇恨言论研究中重新关注利益相关者的专业知识。

Abstract: Counterspeech, i.e. the practice of responding to online hate speech, has
gained traction in NLP as a promising intervention. While early work emphasised
collaboration with non-governmental organisation stakeholders, recent research
trends have shifted toward automated pipelines that reuse a small set of legacy
datasets, often without input from affected communities. This paper presents a
systematic review of 74 NLP studies on counterspeech, analysing the extent to
which stakeholder participation influences dataset creation, model development,
and evaluation. To complement this analysis, we conducted a participatory case
study with five NGOs specialising in online Gender-Based Violence (oGBV),
identifying stakeholder-informed practices for counterspeech generation. Our
findings reveal a growing disconnect between current NLP research and the needs
of communities most impacted by toxic online content. We conclude with concrete
recommendations for re-centring stakeholder expertise in counterspeech
research.

TL;DR: mmGRPO是GRPO的多模块扩展，用于优化多模块AI系统，结合自动提示优化可显著提升任务准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GRPO方法难以直接应用于多模块AI系统，需要一种新方法来优化这类系统的性能。

Method: 提出mmGRPO，通过按模块分组LM调用并处理可变长度和中断轨迹，结合自动提示优化。

Result: mmGRPO在分类、多跳搜索和隐私保护任务中平均提升11%准确率，比单独提示优化高5%。

Conclusion: mmGRPO在多模块AI系统中表现优异，已开源为dspy.GRPO优化器。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has proven to be an effective tool
for post-training language models (LMs). However, AI systems are increasingly
expressed as modular programs that mix together multiple LM calls with distinct
prompt templates and other tools, and it is not clear how best to leverage GRPO
to improve these systems. We begin to address this challenge by defining
mmGRPO, a simple multi-module generalization of GRPO that groups LM calls by
module across rollouts and handles variable-length and interrupted
trajectories. We find that mmGRPO, composed with automatic prompt optimization,
improves accuracy by 11% on average across classification, many-hop search, and
privacy-preserving delegation tasks against the post-trained LM, and by 5%
against prompt optimization on its own. We open-source mmGRPO in DSPy as the
dspy.GRPO optimizer.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Sculptor框架，通过主动上下文管理（ACM）工具帮助大型语言模型（LLMs）优化内部工作记忆，解决长上下文处理中的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在处理长上下文时因无关信息干扰（主动干扰）导致性能显著下降，现有研究多关注外部存储系统，而本文提出通过主动管理内部工作记忆来补充这一不足。

Method: 引入Sculptor框架，提供三类工具：上下文分割、摘要/隐藏/恢复、智能搜索，帮助LLMs主动管理注意力和工作记忆。

Result: 在PI-LLM和NeedleBench Multi-Needle Reasoning等稀疏信息基准测试中，Sculptor显著提升性能，无需额外训练即可利用LLMs的工具调用泛化能力。

Conclusion: 主动上下文管理不仅缓解主动干扰，还为长上下文任务提供更可靠的认知基础，表明明确的上下文控制策略（而非更大的token窗口）是实现规模稳健性的关键。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from significant performance degradation
when processing long contexts due to proactive interference, where irrelevant
information in earlier parts of the context disrupts reasoning and memory
recall. While most research focuses on external memory systems to augment LLMs'
capabilities, we propose a complementary approach: empowering LLMs with Active
Context Management (ACM) tools to actively sculpt their internal working
memory. We introduce Sculptor, a framework that equips LLMs with three
categories of tools: (1) context fragmentation, (2) summary, hide, and restore,
and (3) intelligent search. Our approach enables LLMs to proactively manage
their attention and working memory, analogous to how humans selectively focus
on relevant information while filtering out distractions. Experimental
evaluation on information-sparse benchmarks-PI-LLM (proactive interference) and
NeedleBench Multi-Needle Reasoning-demonstrates that Sculptor significantly
improves performance even without specific training, leveraging LLMs' inherent
tool calling generalization capabilities. By enabling Active Context
Management, Sculptor not only mitigates proactive interference but also
provides a cognitive foundation for more reliable reasoning across diverse
long-context tasks-highlighting that explicit context-control strategies,
rather than merely larger token windows, are key to robustness at scale.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GeRe的框架，通过通用样本回放和阈值边缘损失（TM）来解决大语言模型（LLM）在持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续微调LLM在不同领域时会出现灾难性遗忘，表现为通用能力显著下降和先前任务性能急剧衰退。

Method: GeRe框架利用预训练文本进行高效抗遗忘，并引入基于阈值的边缘损失（TM）来保持激活状态一致性。

Result: 实验表明，TM方法在性能和鲁棒性上均优于其他回放策略。

Conclusion: GeRe框架为LLM的高效回放提供了新思路，解决了灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: The continual learning capability of large language models (LLMs) is crucial
for advancing artificial general intelligence. However, continual fine-tuning
LLMs across various domains often suffers from catastrophic forgetting,
characterized by: 1) significant forgetting of their general capabilities, and
2) sharp performance declines in previously learned tasks. To simultaneously
address both issues in a simple yet stable manner, we propose General Sample
Replay (GeRe), a framework that use usual pretraining texts for efficient
anti-forgetting. Beyond revisiting the most prevalent replay-based practices
under GeRe, we further leverage neural states to introduce a enhanced
activation states constrained optimization method using threshold-based margin
(TM) loss, which maintains activation state consistency during replay learning.
We are the first to validate that a small, fixed set of pre-collected general
replay samples is sufficient to resolve both concerns--retaining general
capabilities while promoting overall performance across sequential tasks.
Indeed, the former can inherently facilitate the latter. Through controlled
experiments, we systematically compare TM with different replay strategies
under the GeRe framework, including vanilla label fitting, logit imitation via
KL divergence and feature imitation via L1/L2 losses. Results demonstrate that
TM consistently improves performance and exhibits better robustness. Our work
paves the way for efficient replay of LLMs for the future. Our code and data
are available at https://github.com/Qznan/GeRe.

Conclusion: FaST为解决有限数据下的个性化偏好对齐问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: LLM-powered conversational assistants are often deployed in a
one-size-fits-all manner, which fails to accommodate individual user
preferences. Recently, LLM personalization -- tailoring models to align with
specific user preferences -- has gained increasing attention as a way to bridge
this gap. In this work, we specifically focus on a practical yet challenging
setting where only a small set of preference annotations can be collected per
user -- a problem we define as Personalized Preference Alignment with Limited
Data (PPALLI). To support research in this area, we introduce two datasets --
DnD and ELIP -- and benchmark a variety of alignment techniques on them. We
further propose FaST, a highly parameter-efficient approach that leverages
high-level features automatically discovered from the data, achieving the best
overall performance.

Abstract: The emergence of reasoning models and their integration into practical AI
chat bots has led to breakthroughs in solving advanced math, deep search, and
extractive question answering problems that requires a complex and multi-step
thought process. Yet, a complete understanding of why these models hallucinate
more than general purpose language models is missing. In this investigative
study, we systematicallyexplore reasoning failures of contemporary language
models on multi-hop question answering tasks. We introduce a novel, nuanced
error categorization framework that examines failures across three critical
dimensions: the diversity and uniqueness of source documents involved ("hops"),
completeness in capturing relevant information ("coverage"), and cognitive
inefficiency ("overthinking"). Through rigorous hu-man annotation, supported by
complementary automated metrics, our exploration uncovers intricate error
patterns often hidden by accuracy-centric evaluations. This investigative
approach provides deeper insights into the cognitive limitations of current
models and offers actionable guidance toward enhancing reasoning fidelity,
transparency, and robustness in future language modeling efforts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VR培训虽具优势，但开发成本高、耗时长，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 系统由LLM模块和智能模块组成，前者提取任务相关信息，后者生成动画演示和视觉提示。

Result: 该方法提高了培训效果，降低了开发成本，使VR培训更具可扩展性和适应性。

Conclusion: 结合LLMs的自动化方法为VR培训提供了高效、灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) has emerged as a powerful tool for workforce training,
offering immersive, interactive, and risk-free environments that enhance skill
acquisition, decision-making, and confidence. Despite its advantages,
developing VR applications for training remains a significant challenge due to
the time, expertise, and resources required to create accurate and engaging
instructional content. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a
novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the
generation of virtual instructions from textual input. The system comprises two
core components: an LLM module that extracts task-relevant information from the
text, and an intelligent module that transforms this information into animated
demonstrations and visual cues within a VR environment. The intelligent module
receives input from the LLM module and interprets the extracted information.
Based on this, an instruction generator creates training content using relevant
data from a database. The instruction generator generates the instruction by
changing the color of virtual objects and creating animations to illustrate
tasks. This approach enhances training effectiveness and reduces development
overhead, making VR-based training more scalable and adaptable to evolving
industrial needs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 圆拟合方法在工业中广泛应用，但噪声数据会显著影响其效果，因此需要有效的异常值检测方法。

Method: 将点集转换为极坐标，计算局部和全局标准差，通过比较局部均值与全局标准差识别异常值。

Result: PCOD算法在工业零件直径测量中表现最佳，优于其他圆拟合和异常值检测方法。

Conclusion: PCOD算法能有效提升工业环境中圆拟合的准确性，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Circle fitting methods are extensively utilized in various industries,
particularly in quality control processes and design applications. The
effectiveness of these algorithms can be significantly compromised when the
point sets to be predicted are noisy. To mitigate this issue, outlier detection
and removal algorithms are often applied before the circle fitting procedure.
This study introduces the Polar Coordinate-Based Outlier Detection (PCOD)
algorithm, which can be effectively employed in circle fitting applications. In
the proposed approach, the point set is first transformed into polar
coordinates, followed by the calculation of both local and global standard
deviations. Outliers are then identified by comparing local mean values with
the global standard deviation. The practicality and efficiency of the proposed
method are demonstrated by focusing on the high-precision diameter measurement
of industrial washer parts. Images from a machine vision system are processed
through preprocessing steps, including sub-pixel edge detection. The resulting
sub-pixel edge points are then cleaned using the proposed outlier detection and
removal algorithm, after which circle fitting is performed. A comparison is
made using ten different circle fitting algorithms and five distinct outlier
detection methods. The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms
the other approaches, delivering the best performance in terms of accuracy
within the dataset, thereby demonstrating its potential for enhancing circle
fitting applications in industrial environments.

Result: 实验显示误差从13-114微米降至1-2微米。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高测量精度和可靠性，适用于相机视野内的所有零件。

Abstract: In camera measurement systems, specialized equipment such as telecentric
lenses is often employed to measure parts with narrow tolerances. However,
despite the use of such equipment, measurement errors can occur due to
mechanical and software-related factors within the system. These errors are
particularly evident in applications where parts of different diameters are
measured using the same setup. This study proposes two innovative approaches to
enhance measurement accuracy using multiple known reference parts: a conversion
factor-based method and a pixel-based method. In the first approach, the
conversion factor is estimated from known references to calculate the diameter
(mm) of the unknown part. In the second approach, the diameter (mm) is directly
estimated using pixel-based diameter information from the references. The
experimental setup includes an industrial-grade camera and telecentric lenses.
Tests conducted on glass samples (1-12 mm) and metal workpieces (3-24 mm) show
that measurement errors, which originally ranged from 13-114 micrometers, were
reduced to 1-2 micrometers using the proposed methods. By utilizing only a few
known reference parts, the proposed approach enables high-accuracy measurement
of all parts within the camera's field of view. Additionally, this method
enhances the existing diameter measurement literature by significantly reducing
error rates and improving measurement reliability.

Conclusion: LLM4-IC8K为IC机械图纸的自动化几何标注提供了有效解决方案，并通过多模态数据集提升了模型的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Printed-Circuit-board (PCB) footprint geometry labeling of integrated
circuits (IC) is essential in defining the physical interface between
components and the PCB layout, requiring exceptional visual perception
proficiency. However, due to the unstructured footprint drawing and abstract
diagram annotations, automated parsing and accurate footprint geometry modeling
remain highly challenging. Despite its importance, no methods currently exist
for automated package geometry labeling directly from IC mechanical drawings.
In this paper, we first investigate the visual perception performance of Large
Multimodal Models (LMMs) when solving IC footprint geometry understanding. Our
findings reveal that current LMMs severely suffer from inaccurate geometric
perception, which hinders their performance in solving the footprint geometry
labeling problem. To address these limitations, we propose LLM4-IC8K, a novel
framework that treats IC mechanical drawings as images and leverages LLMs for
structured geometric interpretation. To mimic the step-by-step reasoning
approach used by human engineers, LLM4-IC8K addresses three sub-tasks:
perceiving the number of pins, computing the center coordinates of each pin,
and estimating the dimensions of individual pins. We present a two-stage
framework that first trains LMMs on synthetically generated IC footprint
diagrams to learn fundamental geometric reasoning and then fine-tunes them on
real-world datasheet drawings to enhance robustness and accuracy in practical
scenarios. To support this, we introduce ICGeo8K, a multi-modal dataset with
8,608 labeled samples, including 4138 hand-crafted IC footprint samples and
4470 synthetically generated samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our model outperforms state-of-the-art LMMs on the proposed benchmark.

Abstract: Thermal infrared imaging exhibits considerable potentials for robotic
perception tasks, especially in environments with poor visibility or
challenging lighting conditions. However, TIR images typically suffer from
heavy non-uniform fixed-pattern noise, complicating tasks such as object
detection, localization, and mapping. To address this, we propose a
diffusion-based TIR image denoising framework leveraging latent-space
representations and wavelet-domain optimization. Utilizing a pretrained stable
diffusion model, our method fine-tunes the model via a novel loss function
combining latent-space and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) / dual-tree complex
wavelet transform (DTCWT) losses. Additionally, we implement a cascaded
refinement stage to enhance fine details, ensuring high-fidelity denoising
results. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance of
our approach compared to state-of-the-art denoising methods. Furthermore, our
method exhibits robust zero-shot generalization to diverse and challenging
real-world TIR datasets, underscoring its effectiveness for practical robotic
deployment.

Abstract: Generating a coherent sequence of images that tells a visual story, using
text-to-image diffusion models, often faces the critical challenge of
maintaining subject consistency across all story scenes. Existing approaches,
which typically rely on fine-tuning or retraining models, are computationally
expensive, time-consuming, and often interfere with the model's pre-existing
capabilities. In this paper, we follow a training-free approach and propose an
efficient consistent-subject-generation method. This approach works seamlessly
with pre-trained diffusion models by introducing masked cross-image attention
sharing to dynamically align subject features across a batch of images, and
Regional Feature Harmonization to refine visually similar details for improved
subject consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
successfully generates visually consistent subjects across a variety of
scenarios while maintaining the creative abilities of the diffusion model.

Abstract: Environment mapping is an important computing task for a wide range of smart
city applications, including autonomous navigation, wireless network operations
and extended reality environments. Conventional smart city mapping techniques,
such as satellite imagery, LiDAR scans, and manual annotations, often suffer
from limitations related to cost, accessibility and accuracy. Open-source
mapping platforms have been widely utilized in artificial intelligence
applications for environment mapping, serving as a source of ground truth.
However, human errors and the evolving nature of real-world environments
introduce biases that can negatively impact the performance of neural networks
trained on such data. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based approach
that integrates the DINOv2 architecture to improve building mapping by
combining maps from open-source platforms with radio frequency (RF) data
collected from multiple wireless user equipments and base stations. Our
approach leverages a vision transformer-based architecture to jointly process
both RF and map modalities within a unified framework, effectively capturing
spatial dependencies and structural priors for enhanced mapping accuracy. For
the evaluation purposes, we employ a synthetic dataset co-produced by Huawei.
We develop and train a model that leverages only aggregated path loss
information to tackle the mapping problem. We measure the results according to
three performance metrics which capture different qualities: (i) The Jaccard
index, also known as intersection over union (IoU), (ii) the Hausdorff
distance, and (iii) the Chamfer distance. Our design achieves a macro IoU of
65.3%, significantly surpassing (i) the erroneous maps baseline, which yields
40.1%, (ii) an RF-only method from the literature, which yields 37.3%, and
(iii) a non-AI fusion baseline that we designed which yields 42.2%.

Conclusion: VQ-DeepISC通过离散化语义特征和优化传输过程，实现了高效的语义通信，为实际应用提供了潜力。

Abstract: Discretization of semantic features enables interoperability between semantic
and digital communication systems, showing significant potential for practical
applications. The fundamental difficulty in digitizing semantic features stems
from the need to preserve continuity and context in inherently analog
representations during their compression into discrete symbols while ensuring
robustness to channel degradation. In this paper, we propose a vector quantized
(VQ)-enabled digital semantic communication system with channel adaptive image
transmission, named VQ-DeepISC. Guided by deep joint source-channel coding
(DJSCC), we first design a Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical semantic
feature extraction, followed by VQ modules projecting features into discrete
latent spaces. Consequently, it enables efficient index-based transmission
instead of raw feature transmission. To further optimize this process, we
develop an attention mechanism-driven channel adaptation module to dynamically
optimize index transmission. Secondly, to counteract codebook collapse during
training process, we impose a distributional regularization by minimizing the
Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between codeword usage frequencies and a
uniform prior. Meanwhile, exponential moving average (EMA) is employed to
stabilize training and ensure balanced feature coverage during codebook
updates. Finally, digital communication is implemented using quadrature phase
shift keying (QPSK) modulation alongside orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM), adhering to the IEEE 802.11a standard. Experimental
results demonstrate superior reconstruction fidelity of the proposed system
over benchmark methods.

Abstract: Recent interest in geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) has fostered a
wide range of applications using artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep
learning, for geospatial problem solving. However, major challenges such as a
lack of training data and the neglect of spatial principles and spatial effects
in AI model design remain, significantly hindering the in-depth integration of
AI with geospatial research. This paper reports our work in developing a deep
learning model that enables object detection, particularly of natural features,
in a weakly supervised manner. Our work makes three contributions: First, we
present a method of object detection using only weak labels. This is achieved
by developing a spatially explicit model based on Tobler's first law of
geography. Second, we incorporate attention maps into the object detection
pipeline and develop a multistage training strategy to improve performance.
Third, we apply this model to detect impact craters on Mars, a task that
previously required extensive manual effort. The model generalizes to both
natural and human-made features on the surfaces of Earth and other planets.
This research advances the theoretical and methodological foundations of GeoAI.

Abstract: Accurately estimating urban rail platform occupancy can enhance transit
agencies' ability to make informed operational decisions, thereby improving
safety, operational efficiency, and customer experience, particularly in the
context of crowding. However, sensing real-time crowding remains challenging
and often depends on indirect proxies such as automatic fare collection data or
staff observations. Recently, Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) footage has
emerged as a promising data source with the potential to yield accurate,
real-time occupancy estimates. The presented study investigates this potential
by comparing three state-of-the-art computer vision approaches for extracting
crowd-related features from platform CCTV imagery: (a) object detection and
counting using YOLOv11, RT-DETRv2, and APGCC; (b) crowd-level classification
via a custom-trained Vision Transformer, Crowd-ViT; and (c) semantic
segmentation using DeepLabV3. Additionally, we present a novel, highly
efficient linear-optimization-based approach to extract counts from the
generated segmentation maps while accounting for image object depth and, thus,
for passenger dispersion along a platform. Tested on a privacy-preserving
dataset created in collaboration with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit
Authority (WMATA) that encompasses more than 600 hours of video material, our
results demonstrate that computer vision approaches can provide substantive
value for crowd estimation. This work demonstrates that CCTV image data,
independent of other data sources available to a transit agency, can enable
more precise real-time crowding estimation and, eventually, timely operational
responses for platform crowding mitigation.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for efficient and accurate weed
segmentation from drone video in precision agriculture. A quality-aware modular
deep-learning framework is proposed that addresses common image degradation by
analyzing quality conditions-such as blur and noise-and routing inputs through
specialized pre-processing and transformer models optimized for each
degradation type. The system first analyzes drone images for noise and blur
using Mean Absolute Deviation and the Laplacian. Data is then dynamically
routed to one of three vision transformer models: a baseline for clean images,
a modified transformer with Fisher Vector encoding for noise reduction, or
another with an unrolled Lucy-Robinson decoder to correct blur. This novel
routing strategy allows the system to outperform existing CNN-based methods in
both segmentation quality and computational efficiency, demonstrating a
significant advancement in deep-learning applications for agriculture.

Abstract: The performance of machine learning models for automated invoice processing
is critically dependent on large-scale, diverse datasets. However, the
acquisition of such datasets is often constrained by privacy regulations and
the high cost of manual annotation. To address this, we present a novel
pipeline for generating high-fidelity, synthetic invoice documents and their
corresponding structured data. Our method first utilizes Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) to extract the text content and precise spatial layout from a
source invoice. Select data fields are then replaced with contextually
realistic, synthetic content generated by a large language model (LLM).
Finally, we employ an inpainting technique to erase the original text from the
image and render the new, synthetic text in its place, preserving the exact
layout and font characteristics. This process yields a pair of outputs: a
visually realistic new invoice image and a perfectly aligned structured data
file (JSON) reflecting the synthetic content. Our approach provides a scalable
and automated solution to amplify small, private datasets, enabling the
creation of large, varied corpora for training more robust and accurate
document intelligence models.

<details>

Motivation: 现有基于RFT的IQA方法缺乏对“思考”过程的奖励监督，且未显式增强模型的低层视觉质量感知，限制了性能上限。

Method: 分两阶段：Stage-1构建Refine-Perception-20K数据集并设计多任务奖励函数；Stage-2引入概率差异奖励策略监督“思考”过程。

Result: Refine-IQA系列模型在感知和评分任务中表现优异，并激活了强大的“思考”能力。

Conclusion: 多阶段RFT框架有效解决了现有方法的不足，显著提升了IQA任务的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) is a proliferating paradigm for LMM training.
Analogous to high-level reasoning tasks, RFT is similarly applicable to
low-level vision domains, including image quality assessment (IQA). Existing
RFT-based IQA methods typically use rule-based output rewards to verify the
model's rollouts but provide no reward supervision for the "think" process,
leaving its correctness and efficacy uncontrolled. Furthermore, these methods
typically fine-tune directly on downstream IQA tasks without explicitly
enhancing the model's native low-level visual quality perception, which may
constrain its performance upper bound. In response to these gaps, we propose
the multi-stage RFT IQA framework (Refine-IQA). In Stage-1, we build the
Refine-Perception-20K dataset (with 12 main distortions, 20,907
locally-distorted images, and over 55K RFT samples) and design multi-task
reward functions to strengthen the model's visual quality perception. In
Stage-2, targeting the quality scoring task, we introduce a probability
difference reward involved strategy for "think" process supervision. The
resulting Refine-IQA Series Models achieve outstanding performance on both
perception and scoring tasks-and, notably, our paradigm activates a robust
"think" (quality interpreting) capability that also attains exceptional results
on the corresponding quality interpreting benchmark.

Conclusion: 4D-PreNet为自动化4D-STEM实时分析提供了高效、通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated experimentation with real time data analysis in scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM) often require end-to-end framework. The
four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) with
high-throughput data acquisition has been constrained by the critical
bottleneck results from data preprocessing. Pervasive noise, beam center drift,
and elliptical distortions during high-throughput acquisition inevitably
corrupt diffraction patterns, systematically biasing quantitative measurements.
Yet, conventional correction algorithms are often material-specific and fail to
provide a robust, generalizable solution. In this work, we present 4D-PreNet,
an end-to-end deep-learning pipeline that integrates attention-enhanced U-Net
and ResNet architectures to simultaneously perform denoising, center
correction, and elliptical distortion calibration. The network is trained on
large, simulated datasets encompassing a wide range of noise levels, drift
magnitudes, and distortion types, enabling it to generalize effectively to
experimental data acquired under varying conditions. Quantitative evaluations
demonstrate that our pipeline reduces mean squared error by up to 50% during
denoising and achieves sub-pixel center localization in the center detection
task, with average errors below 0.04 pixels. The outputs are bench-marked
against traditional algorithms, highlighting improvements in both noise
suppression and restoration of diffraction patterns, thereby facilitating
high-throughput, reliable 4D-STEM real-time analysis for automated
characterization.

Abstract: Impact craters are among the most prominent geomorphological features on
planetary surfaces and are of substantial significance in planetary science
research. Their spatial distribution and morphological characteristics provide
critical information on planetary surface composition, geological history, and
impact processes. In recent years, the rapid advancement of deep learning
models has fostered significant interest in automated crater detection. In this
paper, we apply advancements in deep learning models for impact crater
detection and identification. We use novel models, including Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) and variants such as YOLO and ResNet. We present a
framework that features a two-stage approach where the first stage features
crater identification using simple classic CNN, ResNet-50 and YOLO. In the
second stage, our framework employs YOLO-based detection for crater
localisation. Therefore, we detect and identify different types of craters and
present a summary report with remote sensing data for a selected region. We
consider selected regions for craters and identification from Mars and the Moon
based on remote sensing data. Our results indicate that YOLO demonstrates the
most balanced crater detection performance, while ResNet-50 excels in
identifying large craters with high precision.

Abstract: We propose a diffusion model designed to generate point-based shape
representations with correspondences. Traditional statistical shape models have
considered point correspondences extensively, but current deep learning methods
do not take them into account, focusing on unordered point clouds instead.
Current deep generative models for point clouds do not address generating
shapes with point correspondences between generated shapes. This work aims to
formulate a diffusion model that is capable of generating realistic point-based
shape representations, which preserve point correspondences that are present in
the training data. Using shape representation data with correspondences derived
from Open Access Series of Imaging Studies 3 (OASIS-3), we demonstrate that our
correspondence-preserving model effectively generates point-based hippocampal
shape representations that are highly realistic compared to existing methods.
We further demonstrate the applications of our generative model by downstream
tasks, such as conditional generation of healthy and AD subjects and predicting
morphological changes of disease progression by counterfactual generation.

Abstract: Radiologists often mix medical image reading strategies, including inspection
of individual modalities and local image regions, using information at
different locations from different images independently as well as
concurrently. In this paper, we propose a recommend system to assist machine
learning-based segmentation models, by suggesting appropriate image portions
along with the best modality, such that prostate cancer segmentation
performance can be maximised. Our approach trains a policy network that assists
tumor localisation, by recommending both the optimal imaging modality and the
specific sections of interest for review. During training, a pre-trained
segmentation network mimics radiologist inspection on individual or variable
combinations of these imaging modalities and their sections - selected by the
policy network. Taking the locally segmented regions as an input for the next
step, this dynamic decision making process iterates until all cancers are best
localised. We validate our method using a data set of 1325 labelled
multiparametric MRI images from prostate cancer patients, demonstrating its
potential to improve annotation efficiency and segmentation accuracy,
especially when challenging pathology is present. Experimental results show
that our approach can surpass standard segmentation networks. Perhaps more
interestingly, our trained agent independently developed its own optimal
strategy, which may or may not be consistent with current radiologist
guidelines such as PI-RADS. This observation also suggests a promising
interactive application, in which the proposed policy networks assist human
radiologists.

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-synchronized visual animation enable control of
video content using audios from specific classes. However, existing methods
rely heavily on expensive manual curation of high-quality, class-specific
training videos, posing challenges to scaling up to diverse audio-video classes
in the open world. In this work, we propose an efficient two-stage training
paradigm to scale up audio-synchronized visual animation using abundant but
noisy videos. In stage one, we automatically curate large-scale videos for
pretraining, allowing the model to learn diverse but imperfect audio-video
alignments. In stage two, we finetune the model on manually curated
high-quality examples, but only at a small scale, significantly reducing the
required human effort. We further enhance synchronization by allowing each
frame to access rich audio context via multi-feature conditioning and window
attention. To efficiently train the model, we leverage pretrained text-to-video
generator and audio encoders, introducing only 1.9\% additional trainable
parameters to learn audio-conditioning capability without compromising the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测方法依赖低层次特征和模型特定特征，泛化性和鲁棒性不足；RAG方法在文本领域表现良好，但在视觉领域尚未充分探索。

Method: RAVID结合微调的CLIP图像编码器和VLM，动态检索相关图像以丰富输入，提升检测准确性。

Result: 在UniversalFakeDetect基准测试中，RAVID平均准确率达93.85%，在图像退化条件下仍保持80.27%的准确率，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RAVID通过视觉RAG技术显著提升了AI生成图像检测的性能和鲁棒性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce RAVID, the first framework for AI-generated image
detection that leverages visual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While RAG
methods have shown promise in mitigating factual inaccuracies in foundation
models, they have primarily focused on text, leaving visual knowledge
underexplored. Meanwhile, existing detection methods, which struggle with
generalization and robustness, often rely on low-level artifacts and
model-specific features, limiting their adaptability. To address this, RAVID
dynamically retrieves relevant images to enhance detection. Our approach
utilizes a fine-tuned CLIP image encoder, RAVID CLIP, enhanced with
category-related prompts to improve representation learning. We further
integrate a vision-language model (VLM) to fuse retrieved images with the
query, enriching the input and improving accuracy. Given a query image, RAVID
generates an embedding using RAVID CLIP, retrieves the most relevant images
from a database, and combines these with the query image to form an enriched
input for a VLM (e.g., Qwen-VL or Openflamingo). Experiments on the
UniversalFakeDetect benchmark, which covers 19 generative models, show that
RAVID achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 93.85%.
RAVID also outperforms traditional methods in terms of robustness, maintaining
high accuracy even under image degradations such as Gaussian blur and JPEG
compression. Specifically, RAVID achieves an average accuracy of 80.27% under
degradation conditions, compared to 63.44% for the state-of-the-art model
C2P-CLIP, demonstrating consistent improvements in both Gaussian blur and JPEG
compression scenarios. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大规模预训练数据集对仅使用2D图像进行营养估计的深度学习模型性能的影响，发现JFT-300M预训练模型显著优于公开数据集预训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从2D图像估计食物营养含量对健康监测至关重要，但现有方法依赖专有数据集，限制了可重复性。

Method: 使用Vision Transformer (ViT)模型，在ImageNet和COYO上预训练，并与CNN基线模型及JFT-300M预训练方法比较。

Result: JFT-300M预训练模型表现最佳，COYO预训练模型表现意外差于ImageNet。

Conclusion: 预训练数据集的规模、领域相关性和质量对2D营养估计的迁移学习至关重要。

Abstract: Estimating the nutritional content of food from images is a critical task
with significant implications for health and dietary monitoring. This is
challenging, especially when relying solely on 2D images, due to the
variability in food presentation, lighting, and the inherent difficulty in
inferring volume and mass without depth information. Furthermore,
reproducibility in this domain is hampered by the reliance of state-of-the-art
methods on proprietary datasets for large-scale pre-training. In this paper, we
investigate the impact of large-scale pre-training datasets on the performance
of deep learning models for nutritional estimation using only 2D images. We
fine-tune and evaluate Vision Transformer (ViT) models pre-trained on two large
public datasets, ImageNet and COYO, comparing their performance against
baseline CNN models (InceptionV2 and ResNet-50) and a state-of-the-art method
pre-trained on the proprietary JFT-300M dataset. We conduct extensive
experiments on the Nutrition5k dataset, a large-scale collection of real-world
food plates with high-precision nutritional annotations. Our evaluation using
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAE%) reveals
that models pre-trained on JFT-300M significantly outperform those pre-trained
on public datasets. Unexpectedly, the model pre-trained on the massive COYO
dataset performs worse than the model pre-trained on ImageNet for this specific
regression task, refuting our initial hypothesis. Our analysis provides
quantitative evidence highlighting the critical role of pre-training dataset
characteristics, including scale, domain relevance, and curation quality, for
effective transfer learning in 2D nutritional estimation.

TL;DR: JanusNet是一种针对3D医学图像的数据增强框架，通过全局建模解剖连续性和局部关注难分割区域，显著提升了弱监督医学图像分割的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有数据增强方法在3D医学图像中破坏解剖连续性和忽视难分割区域的问题。

Method: 提出双阶段框架：Slice-Block Shuffle保持解剖连续性，Confidence-Guided Displacement增强难分割区域的信号。

Result: 在Synapse和AMOS数据集上表现优异，例如在仅20%标注数据下，Synapse数据集的DSC提升了4%。

Conclusion: JanusNet通过结合解剖连续性和难分割区域增强，显著提升了弱监督医学图像分割的性能。

Abstract: Limited by the scarcity of training samples and annotations, weakly
supervised medical image segmentation often employs data augmentation to
increase data diversity, while randomly mixing volumetric blocks has
demonstrated strong performance. However, this approach disrupts the inherent
anatomical continuity of 3D medical images along orthogonal axes, leading to
severe structural inconsistencies and insufficient training in challenging
regions, such as small-sized organs, etc. To better comply with and utilize
human anatomical information, we propose JanusNet}, a data augmentation
framework for 3D medical data that globally models anatomical continuity while
locally focusing on hard-to-segment regions. Specifically, our Slice-Block
Shuffle step performs aligned shuffling of same-index slice blocks across
volumes along a random axis, while preserving the anatomical context on planes
perpendicular to the perturbation axis. Concurrently, the Confidence-Guided
Displacement step uses prediction reliability to replace blocks within each
slice, amplifying signals from difficult areas. This dual-stage, axis-aligned
framework is plug-and-play, requiring minimal code changes for most
teacher-student schemes. Extensive experiments on the Synapse and AMOS datasets
demonstrate that JanusNet significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods,
achieving, for instance, a 4% DSC gain on the Synapse dataset with only 20%
labeled data.

Conclusion: CAD-Judge为Text-to-CAD系统提供了一种高效、可验证的奖励机制，显著提升了模型的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models are widely used across industrial design,
simulation, and manufacturing processes. Text-to-CAD systems aim to generate
editable, general-purpose CAD models from textual descriptions, significantly
reducing the complexity and entry barrier associated with traditional CAD
workflows. However, rendering CAD models can be slow, and deploying VLMs to
review CAD models can be expensive and may introduce reward hacking that
degrades the systems. To address these challenges, we propose CAD-Judge, a
novel, verifiable reward system for efficient and effective CAD preference
grading and grammatical validation. We adopt the Compiler-as-a-Judge Module
(CJM) as a fast, direct reward signal, optimizing model alignment by maximizing
generative utility through prospect theory. To further improve the robustness
of Text-to-CAD in the testing phase, we introduce a simple yet effective
agentic CAD generation approach and adopt the Compiler-as-a-Review Module
(CRM), which efficiently verifies the generated CAD models, enabling the system
to refine them accordingly. Extensive experiments on challenging CAD datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while
maintaining superior efficiency.

Motivation: 视频扩散模型（V-DMs）因联合建模时空信息导致令牌序列极长，引发高校准方差和学习困难，需高效量化方法以减少计算成本。

Conclusion: S²Q-VDiT有效解决了V-DMs量化中的校准和学习问题，显著提升了效率和性能。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have emerged as the mainstream paradigm for video
generation models. However, the use of up to billions of parameters incurs
significant computational costs. Quantization offers a promising solution by
reducing memory usage and accelerating inference. Nonetheless, we observe that
the joint modeling of spatial and temporal information in video diffusion
models (V-DMs) leads to extremely long token sequences, which introduces high
calibration variance and learning challenges. To address these issues, we
propose \textbf{$\text{S}^2$Q-VDiT}, a post-training quantization framework for
V-DMs that leverages \textbf{S}alient data and \textbf{S}parse token
distillation. During the calibration phase, we identify that quantization
performance is highly sensitive to the choice of calibration data. To mitigate
this, we introduce \textit{Hessian-aware Salient Data Selection}, which
constructs high-quality calibration datasets by considering both diffusion and
quantization characteristics unique to V-DMs. To tackle the learning
challenges, we further analyze the sparse attention patterns inherent in V-DMs.
Based on this observation, we propose \textit{Attention-guided Sparse Token
Distillation}, which exploits token-wise attention distributions to emphasize
tokens that are more influential to the model's output. Under W4A6
quantization, $\text{S}^2$Q-VDiT achieves lossless performance while delivering
$3.9\times$ model compression and $1.3\times$ inference acceleration. Code will

Motivation: 现有研究显示大型语言模型被动接受缺陷输入，但LMMs是否具备主动检测错误输入的能力尚未探索。

Method: 提出ISEval框架，包含七类缺陷前提和三项评估指标，对十种先进LMMs进行测试。

Result: 多数模型需显式提示检测错误，逻辑错误识别表现较好，但语言错误和条件缺陷识别较差；不同模型对模态信息的信任度不同。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LMMs在主动验证输入有效性方面的不足，为改进提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have witnessed remarkable growth, showcasing
formidable capabilities in handling intricate multimodal tasks with exceptional
performance. Recent research has underscored the inclination of large language
models to passively accept defective inputs, often resulting in futile
reasoning on invalid prompts. However, the same critical question of whether
LMMs can actively detect and scrutinize erroneous inputs still remains
unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the Input Scrutiny Ability
Evaluation Framework (ISEval), which encompasses seven categories of flawed
premises and three evaluation metrics. Our extensive evaluation of ten advanced
LMMs has identified key findings. Most models struggle to actively detect
flawed textual premises without guidance, which reflects a strong reliance on
explicit prompts for premise error identification. Error type affects
performance: models excel at identifying logical fallacies but struggle with
surface-level linguistic errors and certain conditional flaws. Modality trust
varies-Gemini 2.5 pro and Claude Sonnet 4 balance visual and textual info,
while aya-vision-8b over-rely on text in conflicts. These insights underscore
the urgent need to enhance LMMs' proactive verification of input validity and
shed novel insights into mitigating the problem. The code is available at

Result: 实验表明PDSSNet优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PDSSNet通过语义与结构的协同，显著提升了分割的完整性和准确性。

Abstract: In the semantic segmentation of remote sensing images, acquiring complete
ground objects is critical for achieving precise analysis. However, this task
is severely hindered by two major challenges: high intra-class variance and
high inter-class similarity. Traditional methods often yield incomplete
segmentation results due to their inability to effectively unify class
representations and distinguish between similar features. Even emerging
class-guided approaches are limited by coarse class prototype representations
and a neglect of target structural information.
  Therefore, this paper proposes a Prototype-Driven Structure Synergy Network
(PDSSNet). The design of this network is based on a core concept, a complete
ground object is jointly defined by its invariant class semantics and its
variant spatial structure. To implement this, we have designed three key
modules. First, the Adaptive Prototype Extraction Module (APEM) ensures
semantic accuracy from the source by encoding the ground truth to extract
unbiased class prototypes. Subsequently, the designed Semantic-Structure
Coordination Module (SSCM) follows a hierarchical semantics-first,
structure-second principle. This involves first establishing a global semantic
cognition, then leveraging structural information to constrain and refine the
semantic representation, thereby ensuring the integrity of class information.
Finally, the Channel Similarity Adjustment Module (CSAM) employs a dynamic
step-size adjustment mechanism to focus on discriminative features between
classes.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that PDSSNet outperforms state-of-the-art
methods. The source code is available at

Conclusion: DCAR通过双提示学习和联合优化策略，有效提升了图像-文本检索任务的性能，尤其是在细粒度表示学习方面。

Abstract: Recently, prompt learning has demonstrated remarkable success in adapting
pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks such as
image classification. However, its application to the downstream Image-Text
Retrieval (ITR) task is more challenging. We find that the challenge lies in
discriminating both fine-grained attributes and similar subcategories of the
downstream data. To address this challenge, we propose Dual prompt Learning
with Joint Category-Attribute Reweighting (DCAR), a novel dual-prompt learning
framework to achieve precise image-text matching. The framework dynamically
adjusts prompt vectors from both semantic and visual dimensions to improve the
performance of CLIP on the downstream ITR task. Based on the prompt paradigm,
DCAR jointly optimizes attribute and class features to enhance fine-grained
representation learning. Specifically, (1) at the attribute level, it
dynamically updates the weights of attribute descriptions based on text-image
mutual information correlation; (2) at the category level, it introduces
negative samples from multiple perspectives with category-matching weighting to
learn subcategory distinctions. To validate our method, we construct the
Fine-class Described Retrieval Dataset (FDRD), which serves as a challenging
benchmark for ITR in downstream data domains. It covers over 1,500 downstream
fine categories and 230,000 image-caption pairs with detailed attribute
annotations. Extensive experiments on FDRD demonstrate that DCAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance over existing baselines.

Motivation: 路边停车造成的NLoS盲区对道路安全构成威胁，尤其是行人突然出现时。现有方法依赖预定义空间信息或简单反射假设，通用性和实用性有限。

Method: 通过图像分割检测停车车辆，估计深度推断空间特征，再利用2D雷达点云数据精确推断空间信息。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在真实城市道路环境中提高了行人早期检测能力，提升了道路安全性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了动态停车车辆导致的NLoS行人定位问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The presence of Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) blind spots resulting from roadside
parking in urban environments poses a significant challenge to road safety,
particularly due to the sudden emergence of pedestrians. mmWave technology
leverages diffraction and reflection to observe NLoS regions, and recent
studies have demonstrated its potential for detecting obscured objects.
However, existing approaches predominantly rely on predefined spatial
information or assume simple wall reflections, thereby limiting their
generalizability and practical applicability. A particular challenge arises in
scenarios where pedestrians suddenly appear from between parked vehicles, as
these parked vehicles act as temporary spatial obstructions. Furthermore, since
parked vehicles are dynamic and may relocate over time, spatial information
obtained from satellite maps or other predefined sources may not accurately
reflect real-time road conditions, leading to erroneous sensor interpretations.
To address this limitation, we propose an NLoS pedestrian localization
framework that integrates monocular camera image with 2D radar point cloud
(PCD) data. The proposed method initially detects parked vehicles through image
segmentation, estimates depth to infer approximate spatial characteristics, and
subsequently refines this information using 2D radar PCD to achieve precise
spatial inference. Experimental evaluations conducted in real-world urban road
environments demonstrate that the proposed approach enhances early pedestrian
detection and contributes to improved road safety. Supplementary materials are

Domain Adaptation (UDA) challenges in Person ReID and Vehicle ReID, with
further applicability to Object ReID. During pre-training, CycleGAN is employed
to synthesize diverse data, bridging image characteristic gaps across different
domains. In the fine-tuning, an advanced ensemble fusion mechanism, consisting
of the Efficient Channel Attention Block (ECAB) and the Simplified Efficient

representations while reducing ambiguity in pseudo-labels for target samples.
Experimental results on widely used UDA Person ReID and Vehicle ReID datasets

achieving top performance in Mean Average Precision (mAP) and Rank-k Accuracy

Motivation: 现有暗图像恢复方法存在效率瓶颈，包括依赖外部先验的计算负担、多阶段增强管道的冗余操作以及频率域方法的全局计算需求过高。

Method: 引入自我挖掘引导模块（SMGM）生成轻量级内生引导，通过无损小波分解和联合傅里叶增强重构压缩操作链，提出双频率引导框架（DFGF）分离高低频处理。

Result: SPJFNet在多个基准测试中超越现有方法，显著提升了效率，降低了模型复杂性和计算开销。

Conclusion: SPJFNet通过内生引导和频率处理优化，实现了高效且高性能的暗图像恢复。

Abstract: Current dark image restoration methods suffer from severe efficiency
bottlenecks, primarily stemming from: (1) computational burden and error
correction costs associated with reliance on external priors (manual or
cross-modal); (2) redundant operations in complex multi-stage enhancement
pipelines; and (3) indiscriminate processing across frequency components in
frequency-domain methods, leading to excessive global computational demands. To
address these challenges, we propose an Efficient Self-Mining Prior-Guided
Joint Frequency Enhancement Network (SPJFNet). Specifically, we first introduce
a Self-Mining Guidance Module (SMGM) that generates lightweight endogenous
guidance directly from the network, eliminating dependence on external priors
and thereby bypassing error correction overhead while improving inference
speed. Second, through meticulous analysis of different frequency domain
characteristics, we reconstruct and compress multi-level operation chains into
a single efficient operation via lossless wavelet decomposition and joint
Fourier-based advantageous frequency enhancement, significantly reducing
parameters. Building upon this foundation, we propose a Dual-Frequency Guidance
Framework (DFGF) that strategically deploys specialized high/low frequency
branches (wavelet-domain high-frequency enhancement and Fourier-domain
low-frequency restoration), decoupling frequency processing to substantially
reduce computational complexity. Rigorous evaluation across multiple benchmarks
demonstrates that SPJFNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art performance but
also achieves significant efficiency improvements, substantially reducing model
complexity and computational overhead. Code is available at

Abstract: Visual transformation reasoning (VTR) is a vital cognitive capability that
empowers intelligent agents to understand dynamic scenes, model causal
relationships, and predict future states, and thereby guiding actions and
laying the foundation for advanced intelligent systems. However, existing
benchmarks suffer from a sim-to-real gap, limited task complexity, and
incomplete reasoning coverage, limiting their practical use in real-world
scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce VisualTrans, the first
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for VTR in real-world
human-object interaction scenarios. VisualTrans encompasses 12 semantically
diverse manipulation tasks and systematically evaluates three essential
reasoning dimensions - spatial, procedural, and quantitative - through 6
well-defined subtask types. The benchmark features 472 high-quality
question-answer pairs in various formats, including multiple-choice, open-ended
counting, and target enumeration. We introduce a scalable data construction
pipeline built upon first-person manipulation videos, which integrates task
selection, image pair extraction, automated metadata annotation with large
multimodal models, and structured question generation. Human verification
ensures the final benchmark is both high-quality and interpretable. Evaluations
of various state-of-the-art vision-language models show strong performance in
static spatial tasks. However, they reveal notable shortcomings in dynamic,
multi-step reasoning scenarios, particularly in areas like intermediate state
recognition and transformation sequence planning. These findings highlight
fundamental weaknesses in temporal modeling and causal reasoning, providing
clear directions for future research aimed at developing more capable and
generalizable VTR systems. The dataset and code are available at

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has attracted considerable attention in
medical image processing. The latest SSL methods use a combination of
consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling to achieve remarkable success.
However, most existing SSL studies focus on segmenting large organs, neglecting
the challenging scenarios where there are numerous tumors or tumors of small
volume. Furthermore, the extensive capabilities of data augmentation
strategies, particularly in the context of both labeled and unlabeled data,
have yet to be thoroughly investigated. To tackle these challenges, we
introduce a straightforward yet effective approach, termed iterative
pseudo-labeling based adaptive copy-paste supervision (IPA-CP), for tumor
segmentation in CT scans. IPA-CP incorporates a two-way uncertainty based

in the mean teacher architecture into adaptive augmentation. Additionally,
IPA-CP employs an iterative pseudo-label transition strategy to generate more
robust and informative pseudo labels for the unlabeled samples. Extensive
experiments on both in-house and public datasets show that our framework
outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods in medical image segmentation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的手语视频生成方法，通过解耦运动语义与身份信息，实现高质量和灵活性的视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决手语视频生成中数据需求高和泛化能力差的问题。

Result: 实验证明该方法在高质量合成和个性化方面具有优势。

Conclusion: 解耦运动与身份不仅可行，还能提升视频生成的灵活性和质量。

Abstract: Sign language video generation requires producing natural signing motions
with realistic appearances under precise semantic control, yet faces two
critical challenges: excessive signer-specific data requirements and poor
generalization. We propose a new paradigm for sign language video generation
that decouples motion semantics from signer identity through a two-phase
synthesis framework. First, we construct a signer-independent multimodal motion
lexicon, where each gloss is stored as identity-agnostic pose, gesture, and 3D
mesh sequences, requiring only one recording per sign. This compact
representation enables our second key innovation: a discrete-to-continuous
motion synthesis stage that transforms retrieved gloss sequences into
temporally coherent motion trajectories, followed by identity-aware neural
rendering to produce photorealistic videos of arbitrary signers. Unlike prior
work constrained by signer-specific datasets, our method treats motion as a
first-class citizen: the learned latent pose dynamics serve as a portable
"choreography layer" that can be visually realized through different human
appearances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that disentangling motion from
identity is not just viable but advantageous - enabling both high-quality
synthesis and unprecedented flexibility in signer personalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DOMR的框架，用于解决跨视角（第一人称和第三人称）的对象对应问题，通过联合建模多对象的位置和语义关系，实现了密集匹配，并在Ego-Exo4D基准上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨视角对象对应是视觉理解中的关键但具有挑战性的任务，现有方法通常直接匹配单个对象掩码，而忽略了对象间的关系。

Method: 提出了DOMR框架，包含Dense Object Matcher (DOM)模块和掩码细化头。DOM联合建模多对象的位置和语义关系，通过视觉、空间和语义线索实现密集匹配。

Result: 在Ego-Exo4D基准上，DOMR的mIoU达到49.7%（Ego→Exo）和55.2%（Exo→Ego），分别比之前方法提升了5.8%和4.3%。

Conclusion: DOMR通过整合对象间关系和掩码细化，显著提升了跨视角对象对应的性能，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Cross-view object correspondence involves matching objects between egocentric
(first-person) and exocentric (third-person) views. It is a critical yet
challenging task for visual understanding. In this work, we propose the Dense
Object Matching and Refinement (DOMR) framework to establish dense object
correspondences across views. The framework centers around the Dense Object
Matcher (DOM) module, which jointly models multiple objects. Unlike methods
that directly match individual object masks to image features, DOM leverages
both positional and semantic relationships among objects to find
correspondences. DOM integrates a proposal generation module with a dense
matching module that jointly encodes visual, spatial, and semantic cues,
explicitly constructing inter-object relationships to achieve dense matching
among objects. Furthermore, we combine DOM with a mask refinement head designed
to improve the completeness and accuracy of the predicted masks, forming the
complete DOMR framework. Extensive evaluations on the Ego-Exo4D benchmark
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean
IoU of 49.7% on Ego$\to$Exo and 55.2% on Exo$\to$Ego. These results outperform
those of previous methods by 5.8% and 4.3%, respectively, validating the
effectiveness of our integrated approach for cross-view understanding.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于全局可预测插值（GPI）的白盒Transformer框架（GPI-WT），用于k空间插值，显著提高了插值精度和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如卷积神经网络）主要利用局部预测性，而忽略了k空间的全局依赖性。Transformer在自然语言处理和图像分析中表现出色，但其缺乏可解释性。

Method: 从湮灭角度提出GPI作为新的k空间结构化低秩（SLR）模型，将全局湮灭滤波器作为可学习参数，并通过展开SLR的子梯度优化算法构建白盒Transformer。

Result: 实验表明，GPI-WT在k空间插值精度上显著优于现有方法，同时提供更好的可解释性。

Conclusion: GPI-WT是一种高效且可解释的k空间插值方法，为加速MRI提供了新思路。

Abstract: Interpolating missing data in k-space is essential for accelerating imaging.
However, existing methods, including convolutional neural network-based deep
learning, primarily exploit local predictability while overlooking the inherent
global dependencies in k-space. Recently, Transformers have demonstrated
remarkable success in natural language processing and image analysis due to
their ability to capture long-range dependencies. This inspires the use of
Transformers for k-space interpolation to better exploit its global structure.
However, their lack of interpretability raises concerns regarding the
reliability of interpolated data. To address this limitation, we propose
GPI-WT, a white-box Transformer framework based on Globally Predictable
Interpolation (GPI) for k-space. Specifically, we formulate GPI from the
perspective of annihilation as a novel k-space structured low-rank (SLR) model.
The global annihilation filters in the SLR model are treated as learnable
parameters, and the subgradients of the SLR model naturally induce a learnable
attention mechanism. By unfolding the subgradient-based optimization algorithm
of SLR into a cascaded network, we construct the first white-box Transformer
specifically designed for accelerated MRI. Experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
in k-space interpolation accuracy while providing superior interpretability.

TL;DR: Uni-DocDiff是一个基于扩散模型的统一文档修复模型，通过可学习的任务提示和创新的Prior Pool机制，实现了多任务的高效协同和扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文档修复方法多为独立任务模型，系统复杂且难以扩展，缺乏任务间的协同利用。

Method: 提出Uni-DocDiff，采用可学习任务提示和Prior Pool机制（结合局部高频与全局低频特征），并设计Prior Fusion Module（PFM）自适应选择任务相关先验信息。

Result: 实验表明，Uni-DocDiff性能与任务专用模型相当或更优，且具备任务扩展性。

Conclusion: Uni-DocDiff为文档修复提供了一种高效、可扩展的统一解决方案。

Abstract: Removing various degradations from damaged documents greatly benefits
digitization, downstream document analysis, and readability. Previous methods
often treat each restoration task independently with dedicated models, leading
to a cumbersome and highly complex document processing system. Although recent
studies attempt to unify multiple tasks, they often suffer from limited
scalability due to handcrafted prompts and heavy preprocessing, and fail to
fully exploit inter-task synergy within a shared architecture. To address the
aforementioned challenges, we propose Uni-DocDiff, a Unified and highly
scalable Document restoration model based on Diffusion. Uni-DocDiff develops a
learnable task prompt design, ensuring exceptional scalability across diverse
tasks. To further enhance its multi-task capabilities and address potential
task interference, we devise a novel \textbf{Prior \textbf{P}ool}, a simple yet
comprehensive mechanism that combines both local high-frequency features and
global low-frequency features. Additionally, we design the \textbf{Prior
\textbf{F}usion \textbf{M}odule (PFM)}, which enables the model to adaptively
select the most relevant prior information for each specific task. Extensive
experiments show that the versatile Uni-DocDiff achieves performance comparable
or even superior performance compared with task-specific expert models, and
simultaneously holds the task scalability for seamless adaptation to new tasks.

TL;DR: TCSAFormer是一种高效的医学图像分割网络，通过压缩注意力模块和双分支前馈网络模块解决了传统Transformer方法的计算复杂性和局部特征捕捉不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer方法在医学图像分割中存在计算复杂度高和局部上下文信息捕捉不足的问题。

Method: TCSAFormer引入压缩注意力模块（CA）减少计算复杂度，并采用双分支前馈网络模块（DBFFN）增强局部特征和多尺度信息捕捉。

Result: 在ISIC-2018、CVC-ClinicDB和Synapse数据集上的实验表明，TCSAFormer在性能和效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TCSAFormer在医学图像分割中实现了效率和准确性的最优平衡。

Abstract: In recent years, transformer-based methods have achieved remarkable progress
in medical image segmentation due to their superior ability to capture
long-range dependencies. However, these methods typically suffer from two major
limitations. First, their computational complexity scales quadratically with
the input sequences. Second, the feed-forward network (FFN) modules in vanilla
Transformers typically rely on fully connected layers, which limits models'
ability to capture local contextual information and multiscale features
critical for precise semantic segmentation. To address these issues, we propose
an efficient medical image segmentation network, named TCSAFormer. The proposed
TCSAFormer adopts two key ideas. First, it incorporates a Compressed Attention
(CA) module, which combines token compression and pixel-level sparse attention
to dynamically focus on the most relevant key-value pairs for each query. This
is achieved by pruning globally irrelevant tokens and merging redundant ones,
significantly reducing computational complexity while enhancing the model's
ability to capture relationships between tokens. Second, it introduces a
Dual-Branch Feed-Forward Network (DBFFN) module as a replacement for the
standard FFN to capture local contextual features and multiscale information,
thereby strengthening the model's feature representation capability. We conduct
extensive experiments on three publicly available medical image segmentation
datasets: ISIC-2018, CVC-ClinicDB, and Synapse, to evaluate the segmentation
performance of TCSAFormer. Experimental results demonstrate that TCSAFormer
achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methods, while maintaining lower computational overhead, thus achieving an
optimal trade-off between efficiency and accuracy.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了首个专注于遮挡感知的视觉问答基准O-Bench，通过分层合成方法构建数据集，评估了22种多模态大语言模型，发现其与人类表现存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遮挡感知是空间理解的关键，但目前多模态大语言模型在此领域的表现尚未充分探索。

Method: 基于SA-1B数据集，采用分层合成方法构建1,365张图像，标注4,588个问答对，评估22种模型。

Result: 当前模型与人类表现差距显著，无法通过模型规模或思维过程弥补，并识别出三种典型失败模式。

Conclusion: O-Bench为遮挡感知提供了重要评估工具，并启发多模态大语言模型的视觉智能发展。

Abstract: Occlusion perception, a critical foundation for human-level spatial
understanding, embodies the challenge of integrating visual recognition and
reasoning. Though multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities, their performance on occlusion perception remains
under-explored. To address this gap, we introduce O-Bench, the first visual
question answering (VQA) benchmark specifically designed for occlusion
perception. Based on SA-1B, we construct 1,365 images featuring semantically
coherent occlusion scenarios through a novel layered synthesis approach. Upon
this foundation, we annotate 4,588 question-answer pairs in total across five
tailored tasks, employing a reliable, semi-automatic workflow. Our extensive
evaluation of 22 representative MLLMs against the human baseline reveals a
significant performance gap between current MLLMs and humans, which, we find,
cannot be sufficiently bridged by model scaling or thinking process. We further
identify three typical failure patterns, including an overly conservative bias,
a fragile gestalt prediction, and a struggle with quantitative tasks. We
believe O-Bench can not only provide a vital evaluation tool for occlusion
perception, but also inspire the development of MLLMs for better visual
intelligence. Our benchmark will be made publicly available upon paper
publication.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TNet的新架构，通过卷积和加法操作逐步融合多分辨率特征，解决了现有方法忽视全局上下文依赖的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遥感分割网络（如UNet）通常关注局部特征交互，而忽略了多分辨率间的全局上下文依赖。

Method: 提出TNet，利用卷积和加法操作逐步将低分辨率特征（全局上下文）融合到高分辨率特征（局部细节）中。

Result: 在ISPRS Vaihingen、ISPRS Potsdam和LoveDA数据集上，TNet-R分别达到85.35%、87.05%和52.19%的mIoU。

Conclusion: TNet通过简单有效的架构实现了全局与局部特征的融合，性能优越且计算高效。

Abstract: In remote sensing, most segmentation networks adopt the UNet architecture,
often incorporating modules such as Transformers or Mamba to enhance
global-local feature interactions within decoder stages. However, these
enhancements typically focus on intra-scale relationships and neglect the
global contextual dependencies across multiple resolutions. To address this
limitation, we introduce the Terrace Convolutional Decoder Network (TNet), a
simple yet effective architecture that leverages only convolution and addition
operations to progressively integrate low-resolution features (rich in global
context) into higher-resolution features (rich in local details) across
decoding stages. This progressive fusion enables the model to learn
spatially-aware convolutional kernels that naturally blend global and local
information in a stage-wise manner. We implement TNet with a ResNet-18 encoder
(TNet-R) and evaluate it on three benchmark datasets. TNet-R achieves
competitive performance with a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 85.35\%
on ISPRS Vaihingen, 87.05\% on ISPRS Potsdam, and 52.19\% on LoveDA, while
maintaining high computational efficiency. Code is publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如图像上采样或视频超分辨率）未明确考虑3D一致性，或仅隐式处理。3DSR旨在通过显式3D表示解决这一问题。

Method: 利用3D高斯溅射表示场景，结合2D扩散超分辨率模型，无需额外微调即可提升视觉质量。

Result: 在MipNeRF360和LLFF数据上验证，3DSR生成高分辨率结果，视觉效果好且保持3D结构一致性。

Conclusion: 3DSR通过显式3D表示实现高质量超分辨率，代码将开源。

Abstract: We propose 3D Super Resolution (3DSR), a novel 3D Gaussian-splatting-based
super-resolution framework that leverages off-the-shelf diffusion-based 2D
super-resolution models. 3DSR encourages 3D consistency across views via the
use of an explicit 3D Gaussian-splatting-based scene representation. This makes
the proposed 3DSR different from prior work, such as image upsampling or the
use of video super-resolution, which either don't consider 3D consistency or
aim to incorporate 3D consistency implicitly. Notably, our method enhances
visual quality without additional fine-tuning, ensuring spatial coherence
within the reconstructed scene. We evaluate 3DSR on MipNeRF360 and LLFF data,
demonstrating that it produces high-resolution results that are visually
compelling, while maintaining structural consistency in 3D reconstructions.
Code will be released.

Motivation: 现有方法在稀疏视角下难以实现精确几何重建，且传统平滑方法会破坏关键边缘和纹理。

Result: 实验表明，DET-GS在几何精度和视觉保真度上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DET-GS为稀疏视角下的高保真视图合成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) represents a significant advancement in the
field of efficient and high-fidelity novel view synthesis. Despite recent
progress, achieving accurate geometric reconstruction under sparse-view
conditions remains a fundamental challenge. Existing methods often rely on
non-local depth regularization, which fails to capture fine-grained structures
and is highly sensitive to depth estimation noise. Furthermore, traditional
smoothing methods neglect semantic boundaries and indiscriminately degrade
essential edges and textures, consequently limiting the overall quality of
reconstruction. In this work, we propose DET-GS, a unified depth and edge-aware
regularization framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting. DET-GS introduces a
hierarchical geometric depth supervision framework that adaptively enforces
multi-level geometric consistency, significantly enhancing structural fidelity
and robustness against depth estimation noise. To preserve scene boundaries, we
design an edge-aware depth regularization guided by semantic masks derived from
Canny edge detection. Furthermore, we introduce an RGB-guided edge-preserving
Total Variation loss that selectively smooths homogeneous regions while
rigorously retaining high-frequency details and textures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DET-GS achieves substantial improvements in both geometric
accuracy and visual fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on
sparse-view novel view synthesis benchmarks.

Motivation: 医学图像分析中标注数据有限，现有方法难以充分利用视觉语言模型的潜力，存在模态不对齐问题。

Method: 提出 NEARL-CLIP 框架，包含 USEformer（动态生成跨模态查询）和 OCA（正交技术分离新知识）。

Result: NEARL-CLIP 仅引入 1.46M 可学习参数，显著提升了模态交互和模型性能。

Conclusion: NEARL-CLIP 通过跨模态交互和正交技术，有效解决了医学图像分析中的模态不对齐问题。

Abstract: Computer-aided medical image analysis is crucial for disease diagnosis and
treatment planning, yet limited annotated datasets restrict medical-specific
model development. While vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP offer strong
generalization capabilities, their direct application to medical imaging
analysis is impeded by a significant domain gap. Existing approaches to bridge
this gap, including prompt learning and one-way modality interaction
techniques, typically focus on introducing domain knowledge to a single
modality. Although this may offer performance gains, it often causes modality
misalignment, thereby failing to unlock the full potential of VLMs. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{NEARL-CLIP} (i\underline{N}teracted qu\underline{E}ry
\underline{A}daptation with o\underline{R}thogona\underline{L} Regularization),
a novel cross-modality interaction VLM-based framework that contains two
contributions: (1) Unified Synergy Embedding Transformer (USEformer), which
dynamically generates cross-modality queries to promote interaction between
modalities, thus fostering the mutual enrichment and enhancement of multi-modal
medical domain knowledge; (2) Orthogonal Cross-Attention Adapter (OCA). OCA
introduces an orthogonality technique to decouple the new knowledge from
USEformer into two distinct components: the truly novel information and the
incremental knowledge. By isolating the learning process from the interference
of incremental knowledge, OCA enables a more focused acquisition of new
information, thereby further facilitating modality interaction and unleashing
the capability of VLMs. Notably, NEARL-CLIP achieves these two contributions in
a parameter-efficient style, which only introduces \textbf{1.46M} learnable
parameters.

Abstract: Human perception studies can provide complementary insights to qualitative
evaluation for understanding computer vision (CV) model performance. However,
conducting human perception studies remains a non-trivial task, it often
requires complex, end-to-end system setups that are time-consuming and
difficult to scale. In this paper, we explore the unique opportunity presented
by augmented reality (AR) for helping CV researchers to conduct perceptual
studies. We design ARCADE, an evaluation platform that allows researchers to
easily leverage AR's rich context and interactivity for human-centered CV
evaluation. Specifically, ARCADE supports cross-platform AR data collection,
custom experiment protocols via pluggable model inference, and AR streaming for
user studies. We demonstrate ARCADE using two types of CV models, depth and
lighting estimation and show that AR tasks can be effectively used to elicit
human perceptual judgments of model quality. We also evaluate the systems
usability and performance across different deployment and study settings,
highlighting its flexibility and effectiveness as a human-centered evaluation
platform.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有RES方法在性能与成本之间的权衡问题，避免使用参数繁重的SAM或牺牲准确性的轻量级方法。

Method: 提出MLLMSeg框架，结合DSFF模块融合视觉细节和语义特征，并设计轻量级掩码解码器（34M参数）。

Result: 实验表明，MLLMSeg在性能上超越SAM-based和SAM-free方法，平衡了性能与成本。

Conclusion: MLLMSeg为RES任务提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Reference Expression Segmentation (RES) aims to segment image regions
specified by referring expressions and has become popular with the rise of
multimodal large models (MLLMs). While MLLMs excel in semantic understanding,
their token-generation paradigm struggles with pixel-level dense prediction.
Existing RES methods either couple MLLMs with the parameter-heavy Segment
Anything Model (SAM) with 632M network parameters or adopt SAM-free lightweight
pipelines that sacrifice accuracy. To address the trade-off between performance
and cost, we specifically propose MLLMSeg, a novel framework that fully
exploits the inherent visual detail features encoded in the MLLM vision encoder
without introducing an extra visual encoder. Besides, we propose a
detail-enhanced and semantic-consistent feature fusion module (DSFF) that fully
integrates the detail-related visual feature with the semantic-related feature
output by the large language model (LLM) of MLLM. Finally, we establish a
light-weight mask decoder with only 34M network parameters that optimally
leverages detailed spatial features from the visual encoder and semantic
features from the LLM to achieve precise mask prediction. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method generally surpasses both SAM-based and SAM-free
competitors, striking a better balance between performance and cost. Code is

Abstract: Vehicles, as one of the most common and significant objects in the real
world, the researches on which using computer vision technologies have made
remarkable progress, such as vehicle detection, vehicle re-identification, etc.
To search an interested vehicle from the surveillance videos, existing methods
first pre-detect and store all vehicle patches, and then apply vehicle
re-identification models, which is resource-intensive and not very practical.
In this work, we aim to achieve the joint detection and re-identification for
vehicle search. However, the conflicting objectives between detection that
focuses on shared vehicle commonness and re-identification that focuses on
individual vehicle uniqueness make it challenging for a model to learn in an
end-to-end system. For this problem, we propose a new unified framework, namely
CLIPVehicle, which contains a dual-granularity semantic-region alignment module
to leverage the VLMs (Vision-Language Models) for vehicle discrimination
modeling, and a multi-level vehicle identification learning strategy to learn
the identity representation from global, instance and feature levels. We also
construct a new benchmark, including a real-world dataset CityFlowVS, and two
synthetic datasets SynVS-Day and SynVS-All, for vehicle search. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods of both vehicle Re-ID and person search tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents OC-DiT, a novel class of diffusion models designed for
object-centric prediction, and applies it to zero-shot instance segmentation.
We propose a conditional latent diffusion framework that generates instance
masks by conditioning the generative process on object templates and image
features within the diffusion model's latent space. This allows our model to
effectively disentangle object instances through the diffusion process, which
is guided by visual object descriptors and localized image cues. Specifically,
we introduce two model variants: a coarse model for generating initial object
instance proposals, and a refinement model that refines all proposals in
parallel. We train these models on a newly created, large-scale synthetic
dataset comprising thousands of high-quality object meshes. Remarkably, our
model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging real-world
benchmarks, without requiring any retraining on target data. Through
comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate the potential of diffusion
models for instance segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Underwater image enhancement (UIE) techniques aim to improve visual quality
of images captured in aquatic environments by addressing degradation issues
caused by light absorption and scattering effects, including color distortion,
blurring, and low contrast. Current mainstream solutions predominantly employ
multi-scale feature extraction (MSFE) mechanisms to enhance reconstruction
quality through multi-resolution feature fusion. However, our extensive
experiments demonstrate that high-quality image reconstruction does not
necessarily rely on multi-scale feature fusion. Contrary to popular belief, our
experiments show that single-scale feature extraction alone can match or
surpass the performance of multi-scale methods, significantly reducing
complexity. To comprehensively explore single-scale feature potential in
underwater enhancement, we propose an innovative Single-Scale Decomposition
Network (SSD-Net). This architecture introduces an asymmetrical decomposition
mechanism that disentangles input image into clean layer along with degradation
layer. The former contains scene-intrinsic information and the latter encodes
medium-induced interference. It uniquely combines CNN's local feature
extraction capabilities with Transformer's global modeling strengths through
two core modules: 1) Parallel Feature Decomposition Block (PFDB), implementing
dual-branch feature space decoupling via efficient attention operations and
adaptive sparse transformer; 2) Bidirectional Feature Communication Block
(BFCB), enabling cross-layer residual interactions for complementary feature
mining and fusion. This synergistic design preserves feature decomposition
independence while establishing dynamic cross-layer information pathways,
effectively enhancing degradation decoupling capacity.

Abstract: As litter pollution continues to rise globally, developing automated tools
capable of detecting litter effectively remains a significant challenge. This
study presents a novel approach that combines, for the first time, privileged
information with deep learning object detection to improve litter detection
while maintaining model efficiency. We evaluate our method across five widely
used object detection models, addressing challenges such as detecting small
litter and objects partially obscured by grass or stones. In addition to this,
a key contribution of our work can also be attributed to formulating a means of
encoding bounding box information as a binary mask, which can be fed to the
detection model to refine detection guidance. Through experiments on both
within-dataset evaluation on the renowned SODA dataset and cross-dataset
evaluation on the BDW and UAVVaste litter detection datasets, we demonstrate
consistent performance improvements across all models. Our approach not only
bolsters detection accuracy within the training sets but also generalises well
to other litter detection contexts. Crucially, these improvements are achieved
without increasing model complexity or adding extra layers, ensuring
computational efficiency and scalability. Our results suggest that this
methodology offers a practical solution for litter detection, balancing
accuracy and efficiency in real-world applications.

Abstract: Deception detection is a critical task in real-world applications such as
security screening, fraud prevention, and credibility assessment. While deep
learning methods have shown promise in surpassing human-level performance,
their effectiveness often depends on the availability of high-quality and
diverse deception samples. Existing research predominantly focuses on
single-domain scenarios, overlooking the significant performance degradation
caused by domain shifts. To address this gap, we present the SVC 2025
Multimodal Deception Detection Challenge, a new benchmark designed to evaluate
cross-domain generalization in audio-visual deception detection. Participants
are required to develop models that not only perform well within individual
domains but also generalize across multiple heterogeneous datasets. By
leveraging multimodal data, including audio, video, and text, this challenge
encourages the design of models capable of capturing subtle and implicit
deceptive cues. Through this benchmark, we aim to foster the development of
more adaptable, explainable, and practically deployable deception detection
systems, advancing the broader field of multimodal learning. By the conclusion
of the workshop competition, a total of 21 teams had submitted their final
results. https://sites.google.com/view/svc-mm25 for more information.

TL;DR: DS²Net提出了一种多视角深度监督网络，结合细节和语义特征监督，通过不确定性损失优化监督强度，显著提升医学图像分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅单独监督粗粒度语义或细粒度细节特征，忽略了二者的互补关系，限制了医学图像分析的效果。

Method: 提出DS²Net，包含细节增强模块（DEM）和语义增强模块（SEM），分别监督低层细节和高层语义特征，并引入不确定性损失自适应调整监督强度。

Result: 在六个医学图像基准测试中，DS²Net均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DS²Net通过多视角深度监督和自适应损失设计，显著提升了医学图像分割的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep Supervision Networks exhibit significant efficacy for the medical
imaging community. Nevertheless, existing work merely supervises either the
coarse-grained semantic features or fine-grained detailed features in
isolation, which compromises the fact that these two types of features hold
vital relationships in medical image analysis. We advocate the powers of
complementary feature supervision for medical image segmentation, by proposing
a Detail-Semantic Deep Supervision Network (DS$^2$Net). DS$^2$Net navigates
both low-level detailed and high-level semantic feature supervision through
Detail Enhance Module (DEM) and Semantic Enhance Module (SEM). DEM and SEM
respectively harness low-level and high-level feature maps to create detail and
semantic masks for enhancing feature supervision. This is a novel shift from
single-view deep supervision to multi-view deep supervision. DS$^2$Net is also
equipped with a novel uncertainty-based supervision loss that adaptively
assigns the supervision strength of features within distinct scales based on
their uncertainty, thus circumventing the sub-optimal heuristic design that
typifies previous works. Through extensive experiments on six benchmarks
captured under either colonoscopy, ultrasound and microscope, we demonstrate
that DS$^2$Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods for medical
image analysis.

TL;DR: UniFGVC是一个无需训练的通用框架，通过将少样本细粒度视觉分类（FGVC）转化为多模态检索任务，利用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）生成结构化文本描述，显著提升了分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在少样本FGVC中因微调预训练模型导致的过拟合和泛化能力弱的问题。

Method: 提出Category-Discriminative Visual Captioner（CDV-Captioner）生成结构化文本描述，构建多模态类别模板，并通过现成的视觉和文本编码器进行检索。

Result: 在12个FGVC基准测试中表现优于现有的少样本CLIP方法和部分全监督MLLMs方法。

Conclusion: UniFGVC具有广泛的兼容性和适应性，为少样本FGVC提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Few-shot fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) aims to leverage limited
data to enable models to discriminate subtly distinct categories. Recent works
mostly finetuned the pre-trained visual language models to achieve performance
gain, yet suffering from overfitting and weak generalization. To deal with
this, we introduce UniFGVC, a universal training-free framework that
reformulates few-shot FGVC as multimodal retrieval. First, we propose the
Category-Discriminative Visual Captioner (CDV-Captioner) to exploit the
open-world knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate a
structured text description that captures the fine-grained attribute features
distinguishing closely related classes. CDV-Captioner uses chain-of-thought
prompting and visually similar reference images to reduce hallucination and
enhance discrimination of generated captions. Using it we can convert each
image into an image-description pair, enabling more comprehensive feature
representation, and construct the multimodal category templates using few-shot
samples for the subsequent retrieval pipeline. Then, off-the-shelf vision and
text encoders embed query and template pairs, and FGVC is accomplished by
retrieving the nearest template in the joint space. UniFGVC ensures broad
compatibility with diverse MLLMs and encoders, offering reliable generalization
and adaptability across few-shot FGVC scenarios. Extensive experiments on 12
FGVC benchmarks demonstrate its consistent superiority over prior few-shot
CLIP-based methods and even several fully-supervised MLLMs-based approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将RGB和深度生成分开处理，缺乏几何一致性，IDC-Net旨在通过联合学习框架提升几何对齐和相机控制精度。

Method: IDC-Net采用几何感知扩散模型，结合相机-图像-深度一致的数据集和几何感知Transformer块，实现精细相机控制。

Result: 实验表明IDC-Net在视觉质量和几何一致性上优于现有方法，生成的RGB-D序列可直接用于3D场景重建。

Conclusion: IDC-Net通过联合学习框架显著提升了RGB-D序列生成的几何一致性和实用性。

Abstract: We present IDC-Net (Image-Depth Consistency Network), a novel framework
designed to generate RGB-D video sequences under explicit camera trajectory
control. Unlike approaches that treat RGB and depth generation separately,
IDC-Net jointly synthesizes both RGB images and corresponding depth maps within
a unified geometry-aware diffusion model. The joint learning framework
strengthens spatial and geometric alignment across frames, enabling more
precise camera control in the generated sequences. To support the training of
this camera-conditioned model and ensure high geometric fidelity, we construct
a camera-image-depth consistent dataset with metric-aligned RGB videos, depth
maps, and accurate camera poses, which provides precise geometric supervision
with notably improved inter-frame geometric consistency. Moreover, we introduce
a geometry-aware transformer block that enables fine-grained camera control,
enhancing control over the generated sequences. Extensive experiments show that
IDC-Net achieves improvements over state-of-the-art approaches in both visual
quality and geometric consistency of generated scene sequences. Notably, the
generated RGB-D sequences can be directly feed for downstream 3D Scene
reconstruction tasks without extra post-processing steps, showcasing the
practical benefits of our joint learning framework. See more at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练LoRA融合方法在多任务适应中存在权重冲突和领域遗忘问题，尤其在少样本场景下泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出ICM-Fusion框架，利用任务向量算术和元学习动态平衡优化方向，通过Fusion VAE重构融合LoRA。

Result: 实验表明，ICM-Fusion能显著减少多任务损失，并在少样本场景中实现任务增强。

Conclusion: ICM-Fusion是一种高效的多任务LoRA融合方法，适用于多种架构和任务。

Abstract: Enabling multi-task adaptation in pre-trained Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
models is crucial for enhancing their generalization capabilities. Most
existing pre-trained LoRA fusion methods decompose weight matrices, sharing
similar parameters while merging divergent ones. However, this paradigm
inevitably induces inter-weight conflicts and leads to catastrophic domain
forgetting. While incremental learning enables adaptation to multiple tasks, it
struggles to achieve generalization in few-shot scenarios. Consequently, when
the weight data follows a long-tailed distribution, it can lead to forgetting
in the fused weights. To address this issue, we propose In-Context Meta LoRA
Fusion (ICM-Fusion), a novel framework that synergizes meta-learning with
in-context adaptation. The key innovation lies in our task vector arithmetic,
which dynamically balances conflicting optimization directions across domains
through learned manifold projections. ICM-Fusion obtains the optimal task
vector orientation for the fused model in the latent space by adjusting the
orientation of the task vectors. Subsequently, the fused LoRA is reconstructed
by a self-designed Fusion VAE (F-VAE) to realize multi-task LoRA generation. We
have conducted extensive experiments on visual and linguistic tasks, and the
experimental results demonstrate that ICM-Fusion can be adapted to a wide range
of architectural models and applied to various tasks. Compared to the current
pre-trained LoRA fusion method, ICM-Fusion fused LoRA can significantly reduce
the multi-tasking loss and can even achieve task enhancement in few-shot
scenarios.

TL;DR: GAVN是一种通用的音频辅助人脸视频修复网络，通过身份和时间互补学习解决多种视频失真问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了视觉和音频特征的关联，尤其是嘴部区域，且仅针对压缩伪影去除。

Method: GAVN分两阶段：低分辨率空间提取帧间时间特征进行粗修复，高分辨率空间结合音频和面部标志提取身份特征细化修复。

Result: 实验表明GAVN在压缩伪影去除、去模糊和超分辨率任务上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GAVN通过多模态特征融合有效提升了人脸视频修复质量。

Abstract: Face videos accompanied by audio have become integral to our daily lives,
while they often suffer from complex degradations. Most face video restoration
methods neglect the intrinsic correlations between the visual and audio
features, especially in mouth regions. A few audio-aided face video restoration
methods have been proposed, but they only focus on compression artifact
removal. In this paper, we propose a General Audio-assisted face Video
restoration Network (GAVN) to address various types of streaming video
distortions via identity and temporal complementary learning. Specifically,
GAVN first captures inter-frame temporal features in the low-resolution space
to restore frames coarsely and save computational cost. Then, GAVN extracts
intra-frame identity features in the high-resolution space with the assistance
of audio signals and face landmarks to restore more facial details. Finally,
the reconstruction module integrates temporal features and identity features to
generate high-quality face videos. Experimental results demonstrate that GAVN
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on face video compression
artifact removal, deblurring, and super-resolution. Codes will be released upon
publication.

Result: 实验表明，加入社会相关标签显著提升了视觉语言模型的检测性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为多模态在线环境的内容审核提供了新颖且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: The 2025 Global Risks Report identifies state-based armed conflict and
societal polarisation among the most pressing global threats, with social media
playing a central role in amplifying toxic discourse. Memes, as a widely used
mode of online communication, often serve as vehicles for spreading harmful
content. However, limitations in data accessibility and the high cost of
dataset curation hinder the development of robust meme moderation systems. To
address this challenge, in this work, we introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset
of 6,300 real-world meme-based posts annotated in two stages: (i) binary
classification into toxic and normal, and (ii) fine-grained labelling of toxic
memes as hateful, dangerous, or offensive. A key feature of this dataset is
that it is enriched with auxiliary metadata of socially relevant tags,
enhancing the context of each meme. In addition, we propose a tag generation
module that produces socially grounded tags, because most in-the-wild memes
often do not come with tags. Experimental results show that incorporating these
tags substantially enhances the performance of state-of-the-art VLMs detection
tasks. Our contributions offer a novel and scalable foundation for improved
content moderation in multimodal online environments.

Result: 在多个工业数据集上表现出显著的性能提升，实现了高精度和高效适应。

Conclusion: 该方法有效填补了通用MLLM能力与专业异常检测需求之间的差距。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities across diverse domains, their application to specialized anomaly
detection (AD) remains constrained by domain adaptation challenges. Existing
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based approaches suffer from two
critical limitations: inadequate training data utilization when models produce
uniform responses, and insufficient supervision over reasoning processes that
encourage immediate binary decisions without deliberative analysis. We propose
a comprehensive framework addressing these limitations through two synergistic
innovations. First, we introduce a multi-stage deliberative reasoning process
that guides models from region identification to focused examination,
generating diverse response patterns essential for GRPO optimization while
enabling structured supervision over analytical workflows. Second, we develop a
fine-grained reward mechanism incorporating classification accuracy and
localization supervision, transforming binary feedback into continuous signals
that distinguish genuine analytical insight from spurious correctness.
Comprehensive evaluation across multiple industrial datasets demonstrates
substantial performance improvements in adapting general vision-language models
to specialized anomaly detection. Our method achieves superior accuracy with
efficient adaptation of existing annotations, effectively bridging the gap
between general-purpose MLLM capabilities and the fine-grained visual
discrimination required for detecting subtle manufacturing defects and
structural irregularities.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注架构创新，忽视了极暗条件下特征表示的内在不确定性，导致模型可靠性和因果推理能力下降。

Method: 提出U2CLLIE框架，包含不确定性感知双域去噪模块（UaD）和分层因果感知框架（LEN、NeCo、AsC），分别优化频率域噪声和空间-颜色一致性。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优异，具有鲁棒性和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: U2CLLIE通过不确定性感知和因果建模显著提升了低光图像增强的性能。

Abstract: Most existing low-light image enhancement approaches primarily focus on
architectural innovations, while often overlooking the intrinsic uncertainty
within feature representations particularly under extremely dark conditions
where degraded gradient and noise dominance severely impair model reliability
and causal reasoning. To address these issues, we propose U2CLLIE, a novel
framework that integrates uncertainty-aware enhancement and spatial-color
causal correlation modeling. From the perspective of entropy-based uncertainty,
our framework introduces two key components: (1) An Uncertainty-Aware
Dual-domain Denoise (UaD) Module, which leverages Gaussian-Guided Adaptive
Frequency Domain Feature Enhancement (G2AF) to suppress frequency-domain noise
and optimize entropy-driven representations. This module enhances spatial
texture extraction and frequency-domain noise suppression/structure refinement,
effectively mitigating gradient vanishing and noise dominance. (2) A
hierarchical causality-aware framework, where a Luminance Enhancement Network
(LEN) first performs coarse brightness enhancement on dark regions. Then,
during the encoder-decoder phase, two asymmetric causal correlation modeling
modules Neighborhood Correlation State Space (NeCo) and Adaptive Spatial-Color
Calibration (AsC) collaboratively construct hierarchical causal constraints.
These modules reconstruct and reinforce neighborhood structure and color
consistency in the feature space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
U2CLLIE achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark
datasets, exhibiting robust performance and strong generalization across
various scenes.

Abstract: There have been attempts to create large-scale structures in vision models
similar to LLM, such as ViT-22B. While this research has provided numerous
analyses and insights, our understanding of its practical utility remains
incomplete. Therefore, we examine how this model structure reacts and train in
a local environment. We also highlight the instability in training and make
some model modifications to stabilize it. The ViT-22B model, trained from

parameter size. Additionally, we venture into the task of image generation,
which has not been attempted in ViT-22B. We propose an image generation

Motivation: 传统RPCA模型存在计算负担大、依赖精细调参和动态场景适应性差的问题，需要一种更高效且灵活的方法。

Method: RPCANet++通过将松弛的RPCA模型展开为包含背景近似模块（BAM）、对象提取模块（OEM）和图像恢复模块（IRM）的结构化网络，并引入记忆增强模块（MAM）和深度对比先验模块（DCPM）优化性能。

Conclusion: RPCANet++结合RPCA的理论优势与深度网络的效率，为可靠且可解释的稀疏对象分割设定了新基准。

Abstract: Robust principal component analysis (RPCA) decomposes an observation matrix
into low-rank background and sparse object components. This capability has
enabled its application in tasks ranging from image restoration to
segmentation. However, traditional RPCA models suffer from computational
burdens caused by matrix operations, reliance on finely tuned hyperparameters,
and rigid priors that limit adaptability in dynamic scenarios. To solve these
limitations, we propose RPCANet++, a sparse object segmentation framework that
fuses the interpretability of RPCA with efficient deep architectures. Our
approach unfolds a relaxed RPCA model into a structured network comprising a
Background Approximation Module (BAM), an Object Extraction Module (OEM), and
an Image Restoration Module (IRM). To mitigate inter-stage transmission loss in
the BAM, we introduce a Memory-Augmented Module (MAM) to enhance background
feature preservation, while a Deep Contrast Prior Module (DCPM) leverages
saliency cues to expedite object extraction. Extensive experiments on diverse
datasets demonstrate that RPCANet++ achieves state-of-the-art performance under
various imaging scenarios. We further improve interpretability via visual and
numerical low-rankness and sparsity measurements. By combining the theoretical
strengths of RPCA with the efficiency of deep networks, our approach sets a new
baseline for reliable and interpretable sparse object segmentation. Codes are
available at our Project Webpage https://fengyiwu98.github.io/rpcanetx.

Motivation: 生物医学MLLMs的训练数据可能包含隐私和错误知识，传统重训练方法成本高，需研究高效遗忘方法。

Method: 构建MLLMU-Med基准，集成合成隐私数据和错误知识，提出遗忘效率评分，评估五种遗忘方法。

Result: 现有方法在移除有害知识方面效果有限，显示改进空间。

Conclusion: MLLMU-Med为生物医学MLLMs安全研究提供新方向。

Abstract: The security of biomedical Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has
attracted increasing attention. However, training samples easily contain
private information and incorrect knowledge that are difficult to detect,
potentially leading to privacy leakage or erroneous outputs after deployment.
An intuitive idea is to reprocess the training set to remove unwanted content
and retrain the model from scratch. Yet, this is impractical due to significant
computational costs, especially for large language models. Machine unlearning
has emerged as a solution to this problem, which avoids complete retraining by
selectively removing undesired knowledge derived from harmful samples while
preserving required capabilities on normal cases. However, there exist no
available datasets to evaluate the unlearning quality for security protection
in biomedical MLLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose the first benchmark
Multimodal Large Language Model Unlearning for BioMedicine (MLLMU-Med) built
upon our novel data generation pipeline that effectively integrates synthetic
private data and factual errors into the training set. Our benchmark targets
two key scenarios: 1) Privacy protection, where patient private information is
mistakenly included in the training set, causing models to unintentionally
respond with private data during inference; and 2) Incorrectness removal, where
wrong knowledge derived from unreliable sources is embedded into the dataset,
leading to unsafe model responses. Moreover, we propose a novel Unlearning
Efficiency Score that directly reflects the overall unlearning performance
across different subsets. We evaluate five unlearning approaches on MLLMU-Med
and find that these methods show limited effectiveness in removing harmful
knowledge from biomedical MLLMs, indicating significant room for improvement.
This work establishes a new pathway for further research in this promising
field.

limitations in both accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we rethink the
Video TextVQA task from an instance-oriented perspective and propose a novel
model termed GAT (Gather and Trace). First, to obtain accurate reading result
for each video text instance, a context-aggregated instance gathering module is
designed to integrate the visual appearance, layout characteristics, and
textual contents of the related entities into a unified textual representation.
Then, to capture dynamic evolution of text in the video flow, an
instance-focused trajectory tracing module is utilized to establish
spatio-temporal relationships between instances and infer the final answer.
Extensive experiments on several public Video TextVQA datasets validate the
effectiveness and generalization of our framework. GAT outperforms existing
Video TextVQA methods, video-language pretraining methods, and video large
language models in both accuracy and inference speed. Notably, GAT surpasses
the previous state-of-the-art Video TextVQA methods by 3.86\% in accuracy and
achieves ten times of faster inference speed than video large language models.

TL;DR: BootSC是一个端到端的深度谱聚类模型，通过联合优化谱聚类的所有阶段，并利用最优传输监督和正交重参数化技术，显著提升了聚类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 谱聚类存在优化过程不连贯和表示能力有限的问题，BootSC旨在解决这些问题。

Method: BootSC通过单一网络端到端学习谱聚类的所有阶段（亲和矩阵构建、谱嵌入和k均值聚类），并利用最优传输监督和正交重参数化技术。

Result: 实验表明，BootSC在聚类性能上达到最先进水平，例如在ImageNet-Dogs数据集上NMI提升了16%。

Conclusion: BootSC通过端到端联合优化和新技术应用，显著提升了谱聚类的性能。

Abstract: Spectral clustering is a leading clustering method. Two of its major
shortcomings are the disjoint optimization process and the limited
representation capacity. To address these issues, we propose a deep spectral
clustering model (named BootSC), which jointly learns all stages of spectral
clustering -- affinity matrix construction, spectral embedding, and $k$-means
clustering -- using a single network in an end-to-end manner. BootSC leverages
effective and efficient optimal-transport-derived supervision to bootstrap the
affinity matrix and the cluster assignment matrix. Moreover, a
semantically-consistent orthogonal re-parameterization technique is introduced
to orthogonalize spectral embeddings, significantly enhancing the
discrimination capability. Experimental results indicate that BootSC achieves
state-of-the-art clustering performance. For example, it accomplishes a notable
16\% NMI improvement over the runner-up method on the challenging ImageNet-Dogs
dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/spdj2271/BootSC.

*Ben Zhang,LuLu Yu,Lei Gao,Jing Liu,QuanJiang Guo,Hui Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViFP是一个提升视觉语言模型（VLM）推理可靠性的通用框架，通过检测假阳性（FP）推理路径，提高答案准确性和推理合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖特定多步推理数据集和强化学习策略，训练成本高且泛化能力有限。ViFP旨在解决这些问题。

Method: ViFP通过构建基于视觉推理核心维度的子问题模板，利用多轮问答构建有效推理路径，并动态分析推理路径一致性以识别FP。

Result: 在A-OKVQA、OKVQA和FVQA数据集上，ViFP显著提升性能，A-OKVQA准确率提升5.4%，FP数量显著减少。

Conclusion: ViFP通过检测FP和优化推理路径，显著提升了VLM的推理可靠性，并提出了新的评估指标VoC。

Abstract: In visual-language model (VLM) reasoning, false positive(FP) reasoning occurs
when a model generates a correct answer but follows an incorrect reasoning
path. Existing methods based on specific multi-step reasoning datasets and
reinforcement learning strategies, leading to high training costs and limited
generalization. In this work, we propose ViFP, a general framework for
enhancing visual reasoning reliability. It improves both answer accuracy and
reasoning soundness by detecting FPs. ViFP tackles the limitations of dataset
dependency and poor generalization by constructing sub-question templates
grounded in the core dimensions of visual reasoning, such as object
localization, characteristic description, and object discovery. ViFP then
builds effective reasoning paths via multi-turn QA to improve reasoning
accuracy. Meanwhile, ViFP dynamically analyzes the consistency of reasoning
path to identify potential FPs, and introduces a targeted chain-of-thought
(CoT) mechanism that adaptively guides both FP and non-FP samples. Thereby
reducing logical errors in the reasoning path while preserving accuracy.
Finally, we introduce a reliability evaluation metric-VoC, which integrates
answer accuracy and the FP rate, providing a quantitative tool to assess
whether a VLM not only answers correctly, but also reasons reliably. Our
experiments on closed-source VLMs show that ViFP consistently improves
performance across three datasets: A-OKVQA, OKVQA, and FVQA. On A-OKVQA, ViFP
improves accuracy by up to 5.4%, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by
4.3%, and significantly reduces the number of FPs, validating its benefits in
enhancing reasoning reliability.

Conclusion: MMCAF-Net有效解决了多模态数据融合问题，提升了医学诊断的准确性。

Abstract: The diagnosis of medical diseases faces challenges such as the misdiagnosis
of small lesions. Deep learning, particularly multimodal approaches, has shown
great potential in the field of medical disease diagnosis. However, the
differences in dimensionality between medical imaging and electronic health
record data present challenges for effective alignment and fusion. To address
these issues, we propose the Multimodal Multiscale Cross-Attention Fusion
Network (MMCAF-Net). This model employs a feature pyramid structure combined
with an efficient 3D multi-scale convolutional attention module to extract
lesion-specific features from 3D medical images. To further enhance multimodal
data integration, MMCAF-Net incorporates a multi-scale cross-attention module,
which resolves dimensional inconsistencies, enabling more effective feature
fusion. We evaluated MMCAF-Net on the Lung-PET-CT-Dx dataset, and the results
showed a significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing current
state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

Motivation: 标准分割方法无法识别训练分类外的概念，开放词汇方法虽承诺解决但性能停滞。

Conclusion: 新组件为开放词汇模型的性能提升提供了重要见解和解决方案。

Abstract: Standard segmentation setups are unable to deliver models that can recognize
concepts outside the training taxonomy. Open-vocabulary approaches promise to
close this gap through language-image pretraining on billions of image-caption
pairs. Unfortunately, we observe that the promise is not delivered due to
several bottlenecks that have caused the performance to plateau for almost two
years. This paper proposes novel oracle components that identify and decouple
these bottlenecks by taking advantage of the groundtruth information. The
presented validation experiments deliver important empirical findings that
provide a deeper insight into the failures of open-vocabulary models and
suggest prominent approaches to unlock the future research.

TL;DR: SplitGaussian提出了一种新框架，通过显式分解场景表示来解决动态3D场景重建中的运动泄漏和几何失真问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将静态和动态元素耦合建模，导致运动泄漏、几何失真和时间闪烁。

Method: SplitGaussian将场景表示分解为静态和动态组件，解耦运动建模与背景几何。

Result: 实验表明，SplitGaussian在渲染质量、几何稳定性和运动分离方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SplitGaussian通过解耦设计提高了时间一致性和重建保真度，同时加速收敛。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular video remains fundamentally
challenging due to the need to jointly infer motion, structure, and appearance
from limited observations. Existing dynamic scene reconstruction methods based
on Gaussian Splatting often entangle static and dynamic elements in a shared
representation, leading to motion leakage, geometric distortions, and temporal
flickering. We identify that the root cause lies in the coupled modeling of
geometry and appearance across time, which hampers both stability and
interpretability. To address this, we propose \textbf{SplitGaussian}, a novel
framework that explicitly decomposes scene representations into static and
dynamic components. By decoupling motion modeling from background geometry and
allowing only the dynamic branch to deform over time, our method prevents
motion artifacts in static regions while supporting view- and time-dependent
appearance refinement. This disentangled design not only enhances temporal
consistency and reconstruction fidelity but also accelerates convergence.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SplitGaussian outperforms prior
state-of-the-art methods in rendering quality, geometric stability, and motion
separation.

Conclusion: 该综述为开发终身视觉语言系统提供了全面参考，并提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse multimodal tasks by leveraging large-scale pre-training. However,
enabling them to learn continually from non-stationary data remains a major
challenge, as their cross-modal alignment and generalization capabilities are
particularly vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting. Unlike traditional unimodal
continual learning (CL), VLMs face unique challenges such as cross-modal
feature drift, parameter interference due to shared architectures, and
zero-shot capability erosion. This survey offers the first focused and
systematic review of continual learning for VLMs (VLM-CL). We begin by
identifying the three core failure modes that degrade performance in VLM-CL.
Based on these, we propose a challenge-driven taxonomy that maps solutions to
their target problems: (1) \textit{Multi-Modal Replay Strategies} address
cross-modal drift through explicit or implicit memory mechanisms; (2)
\textit{Cross-Modal Regularization} preserves modality alignment during
updates; and (3) \textit{Parameter-Efficient Adaptation} mitigates parameter
interference with modular or low-rank updates. We further analyze current
evaluation protocols, datasets, and metrics, highlighting the need for better
benchmarks that capture VLM-specific forgetting and compositional
generalization. Finally, we outline open problems and future directions,
including continual pre-training and compositional zero-shot learning. This
survey aims to serve as a comprehensive and diagnostic reference for
researchers developing lifelong vision-language systems. All resources are

Motivation: 现有T2V生成模型在多对象运动场景中表现不佳，尤其是轨迹交叉时语义冲突严重。

Method: 通过分层生成背景和前景对象，独立控制各层元素，实现多对象运动的灵活合成。

Result: 实验表明，LayerT2V在mIoU和AP50指标上分别比SOTA方法提升了1.4倍和4.5倍。

Conclusion: LayerT2V为多对象视频生成提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了生成质量和控制能力。

Abstract: Controlling object motion trajectories in Text-to-Video (T2V) generation is a
challenging and relatively under-explored area, particularly in scenarios
involving multiple moving objects. Most community models and datasets in the
T2V domain are designed for single-object motion, limiting the performance of
current generative models in multi-object tasks. Additionally, existing motion
control methods in T2V either lack support for multi-object motion scenes or
experience severe performance degradation when object trajectories intersect,
primarily due to the semantic conflicts in colliding regions. To address these
limitations, we introduce LayerT2V, the first approach for generating video by
compositing background and foreground objects layer by layer. This layered
generation enables flexible integration of multiple independent elements within
a video, positioning each element on a distinct "layer" and thus facilitating
coherent multi-object synthesis while enhancing control over the generation
process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of LayerT2V in
generating complex multi-object scenarios, showcasing 1.4x and 4.5x
improvements in mIoU and AP50 metrics over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Conclusion: 结合运动意图的扩散模型能有效提升行人轨迹预测的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Predicting pedestrian motion trajectories is critical for path planning and
motion control of autonomous vehicles. However, accurately forecasting crowd
trajectories remains a challenging task due to the inherently multimodal and
uncertain nature of human motion. Recent diffusion-based models have shown
promising results in capturing the stochasticity of pedestrian behavior for
trajectory prediction. However, few diffusion-based approaches explicitly
incorporate the underlying motion intentions of pedestrians, which can limit
the interpretability and precision of prediction models. In this work, we
propose a diffusion-based multimodal trajectory prediction model that
incorporates pedestrians' motion intentions into the prediction framework. The
motion intentions are decomposed into lateral and longitudinal components, and
a pedestrian intention recognition module is introduced to enable the model to
effectively capture these intentions. Furthermore, we adopt an efficient
guidance mechanism that facilitates the generation of interpretable
trajectories. The proposed framework is evaluated on two widely used human
trajectory prediction benchmarks, ETH and UCY, on which it is compared against
state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate that our method
achieves competitive performance.

Conclusion: 冻结嵌入方法在特定场景下是可行的替代方案，适合预计算输入或部署受限的场景。

Abstract: The deployment of vision-language models remains constrained by substantial
computational requirements. We present \textbf{FrEVL}, a framework exploring
whether frozen pretrained embeddings can support effective vision-language
understanding. Our analysis reveals that frozen embeddings contain rich
information for discriminative tasks, achieving 85\% to 95\% of
state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks with only 68.4M trainable
parameters. This performance dichotomy reveals a critical insight: frozen
embedding effectiveness depends on alignment between pretraining objectives and
downstream task requirements. When accounting for end-to-end computation
including embedding extraction, FrEVL provides $2.3\times$ speedup with 52\%
lower energy consumption, making it suitable for scenarios with pre-computable
inputs or when deployment constraints outweigh marginal performance gains. Our
evaluation provides practitioners with guidance on when frozen embedding
approaches represent viable alternatives to full model deployment. We will
release our complete implementation and evaluation framework to facilitate
further research into efficient multi-modal understanding.

Abstract: As black-box AI-driven decision-making systems become increasingly widespread
in modern document processing workflows, improving their transparency and
reliability has become critical, especially in high-stakes applications where
biases or spurious correlations in decision-making could lead to serious
consequences. One vital component often found in such document processing
workflows is document image classification, which, despite its widespread use,
remains difficult to explain. While some recent works have attempted to explain
the decisions of document image classification models through
feature-importance maps, these maps are often difficult to interpret and fail
to provide insights into the global features learned by the model. In this
paper, we aim to bridge this research gap by introducing generative document
counterfactuals that provide meaningful insights into the model's
decision-making through actionable explanations. In particular, we propose
DocVCE, a novel approach that leverages latent diffusion models in combination
with classifier guidance to first generate plausible in-distribution visual
counterfactual explanations, and then performs hierarchical patch-wise
refinement to search for a refined counterfactual that is closest to the target
factual image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a
rigorous qualitative and quantitative assessment on 3 different document
classification datasets -- RVL-CDIP, Tobacco3482, and DocLayNet -- and 3
different models -- ResNet, ConvNeXt, and DiT -- using well-established
evaluation criteria such as validity, closeness, and realism. To the best of
the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to explore generative
counterfactual explanations in document image analysis.

Conclusion: Obliviate是一种高效且轻量的方法，能有效减少LVLMs的幻觉问题，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: As scaling up training data has significantly improved the general multimodal
capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), they still suffer from
the hallucination issue, generating text that is inconsistent with the visual
input. This phenomenon motivates us to systematically investigate the role of
training data in hallucination. We introduce a new benchmark, POPEv2, which
consists of counterfactual images collected from the training data of LVLMs
with certain objects masked. Through comprehensive evaluation on POPEv2, we
find that current LVLMs suffer from training bias: they fail to fully leverage
their training data and hallucinate more frequently on images seen during
training. Specifically, they perform poorly on counterfactual images, often
incorrectly answering ``Yes'' to questions about masked objects. To understand
this issue, we conduct probing experiments on the models' internal components,
revealing that this training bias is primarily located in the language modeling
(LM) head. Based on these findings, we propose Obliviate, an efficient and
lightweight unlearning method designed to mitigate object hallucination via
training bias unlearning. Obliviate identifies the discrepancy between
ground-truth labels and model outputs on the training data as a proxy for bias
and adopts a parameter- and data-efficient fine-tuning strategy that only
updates the LM head. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. While only reusing the training data and updating approximately 2\%
of the parameters, Obliviate significantly reduces hallucination across both
discriminative and generative tasks. Furthermore, it demonstrates strong
scalability with respect to both model size (2B to 72B) and training data
volume, and exhibits promising generalization to hallucination types beyond
object-level hallucination. Our code and data will be publicly released.

accuracy ($\geq$75\%). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of CNNs in
using SAR data for both geometric and environmental classification tasks. Our
investigation also explores the effect of SAR data acquisition at different

Conclusion: PIS3R是一种高效的大视差图像拼接解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Image stitching aim to align two images taken from different viewpoints into
one seamless, wider image. However, when the 3D scene contains depth variations
and the camera baseline is significant, noticeable parallax occurs-meaning the
relative positions of scene elements differ substantially between views. Most
existing stitching methods struggle to handle such images with large parallax
effectively. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose an image
stitching solution called PIS3R that is robust to very large parallax based on
the novel concept of deep 3D reconstruction. First, we apply visual geometry
grounded transformer to two input images with very large parallax to obtain
both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, as well as the dense 3D scene
reconstruction. Subsequently, we reproject reconstructed dense point cloud onto
a designated reference view using the recovered camera parameters, achieving
pixel-wise alignment and generating an initial stitched image. Finally, to
further address potential artifacts such as holes or noise in the initial
stitching, we propose a point-conditioned image diffusion module to obtain the
refined result.Compared with existing methods, our solution is very large
parallax tolerant and also provides results that fully preserve the geometric
integrity of all pixels in the 3D photogrammetric context, enabling direct
applicability to downstream 3D vision tasks such as SfM. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides accurate stitching results for
images with very large parallax, and outperforms the existing methods
qualitatively and quantitatively.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, vehicle perception,
particularly detection and segmentation, has placed increasingly higher demands
on algorithmic performance. Pre-trained large segmentation models, especially
Segment Anything Model (SAM), have sparked significant interest and inspired
new research directions in artificial intelligence. However, SAM cannot be
directly applied to the fine-grained task of vehicle part segmentation, as its
text-prompted segmentation functionality is not publicly accessible, and the
mask regions generated by its default mode lack semantic labels, limiting its
utility in structured, category-specific segmentation tasks. To address these
limitations, we propose SAV, a novel framework comprising three core
components: a SAM-based encoder-decoder, a vehicle part knowledge graph, and a
context sample retrieval encoding module. The knowledge graph explicitly models
the spatial and geometric relationships among vehicle parts through a
structured ontology, effectively encoding prior structural knowledge.
Meanwhile, the context retrieval module enhances segmentation by identifying
and leveraging visually similar vehicle instances from training data, providing
rich contextual priors for improved generalization. Furthermore, we introduce a
new large-scale benchmark dataset for vehicle part segmentation, named
VehicleSeg10K, which contains 11,665 high-quality pixel-level annotations
across diverse scenes and viewpoints. We conduct comprehensive experiments on
this dataset and two other datasets, benchmarking multiple representative
baselines to establish a solid foundation for future research and comparison. %

TL;DR: 本文重新评估了直接微调（DFT）在持续语义分割（CSS）中的表现，发现预训练视觉模型（PVMs）具有强大的抗遗忘能力，并提出了一种改进方法DFT*，其性能优于现有复杂方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究低估了PVMs在CSS中的抗遗忘能力，并错误地将DFT视为性能下限，本文旨在纠正这一误解并探索更高效的解决方案。

Method: 通过系统实验分析DFT在两种基准数据集（Pascal VOC 2012和ADE20K）和两种PVM主干（ResNet101和Swin-B）下的表现，提出DFT*方法，包括冻结主干和分类器、预分配未来分类器等策略。

Result: 实验表明，DFT*在性能上优于16种现有CSS方法，同时显著减少可训练参数和训练时间。

Conclusion: PVMs在CSS中具有强大的抗遗忘能力，DFT*是一种简单高效的方法，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) seeks to incrementally learn to segment
novel classes while preserving knowledge of previously encountered ones. Recent
advancements in CSS have been largely driven by the adoption of Pre-trained
Vision Models (PVMs) as backbones. Among existing strategies, Direct
Fine-Tuning (DFT), which sequentially fine-tunes the model across classes,
remains the most straightforward approach. Prior work often regards DFT as a
performance lower bound due to its presumed vulnerability to severe
catastrophic forgetting, leading to the development of numerous complex
mitigation techniques. However, we contend that this prevailing assumption is
flawed. In this paper, we systematically revisit forgetting in DFT across two
standard benchmarks, Pascal VOC 2012 and ADE20K, under eight CSS settings using
two representative PVM backbones: ResNet101 and Swin-B. Through a detailed
probing analysis, our findings reveal that existing methods significantly
underestimate the inherent anti-forgetting capabilities of PVMs. Even under
DFT, PVMs retain previously learned knowledge with minimal forgetting. Further
investigation of the feature space indicates that the observed forgetting
primarily arises from the classifier's drift away from the PVM, rather than
from degradation of the backbone representations. Based on this insight, we
propose DFT*, a simple yet effective enhancement to DFT that incorporates
strategies such as freezing the PVM backbone and previously learned
classifiers, as well as pre-allocating future classifiers. Extensive
experiments show that DFT* consistently achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to sixteen state-of-the-art CSS methods, while requiring
substantially fewer trainable parameters and less training time.

Result: 实验证明，该方法在处理多种影响因素时表现优异，效率和实用性显著提升。

Conclusion: PKSS-Align是一种高效、鲁棒的点云配准方法，适用于多种复杂场景，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a classical topic in the field of 3D Vision and
Computer Graphics. Generally, the implementation of registration is typically
sensitive to similarity transformations (translation, scaling, and rotation),
noisy points, and incomplete geometric structures. Especially, the non-uniform
scales and defective parts of point clouds increase probability of struck local
optima in registration task. In this paper, we propose a robust point cloud
registration PKSS-Align that can handle various influences, including
similarity transformations, non-uniform densities, random noisy points, and
defective parts. The proposed method measures shape feature-based similarity
between point clouds on the Pre-Kendall shape space (PKSS),
\textcolor{black}{which is a shape measurement-based scheme and doesn't require
point-to-point or point-to-plane metric.} The employed measurement can be
regarded as the manifold metric that is robust to various representations in
the Euclidean coordinate system. Benefited from the measurement, the
transformation matrix can be directly generated for point clouds with mentioned
influences at the same time. The proposed method does not require data training
and complex feature encoding. Based on a simple parallel acceleration, it can
achieve significant improvement for efficiency and feasibility in practice.
Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the relevant
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We present Multi-Baseline Gaussian Splatting (MuRF), a generalized
feed-forward approach for novel view synthesis that effectively handles diverse
baseline settings, including sparse input views with both small and large
baselines. Specifically, we integrate features from Multi-View Stereo (MVS) and
Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) to enhance feature representations for
generalizable reconstruction. Next, We propose a projection-and-sampling
mechanism for deep depth fusion, which constructs a fine probability volume to
guide the regression of the feature map. Furthermore, We introduce a
reference-view loss to improve geometry and optimization efficiency. We
leverage 3D Gaussian representations to accelerate training and inference time
while enhancing rendering quality. MuRF achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple baseline settings and diverse scenarios ranging from simple

Motivation: 现有DETR模型在TSG任务中因缺乏显式监督导致查询角色重叠，预测冗余。本文旨在通过利用视频-描述对的长度先验，使每个查询专注于特定功能。

Method: 提出LATR模型，将查询分为短、中、长三组，并引入长度分类任务，抑制不匹配长度的预测，使查询各司其职。

Result: 在三个公开基准测试中达到最优性能，消融实验验证了各组件及长度先验的重要性。

Conclusion: LATR通过明确查询角色和利用长度先验，显著提升了TSG任务的性能，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Temporal sentence grounding (TSG) is a highly challenging task aiming to
localize the temporal segment within an untrimmed video corresponding to a
given natural language description. Benefiting from the design of learnable
queries, the DETR-based models have achieved substantial advancements in the
TSG task. However, the absence of explicit supervision often causes the learned
queries to overlap in roles, leading to redundant predictions. Therefore, we
propose to improve TSG by making each query fulfill its designated role,
leveraging the length priors of the video-description pairs. In this paper, we
introduce the Length-Aware Transformer (LATR) for TSG, which assigns different
queries to handle predictions based on varying temporal lengths. Specifically,
we divide all queries into three groups, responsible for segments with short,
middle, and long temporal durations, respectively. During training, an
additional length classification task is introduced. Predictions from queries
with mismatched lengths are suppressed, guiding each query to specialize in its
designated function. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
LATR, achieving state-of-the-art performance on three public benchmarks.
Furthermore, the ablation studies validate the contribution of each component
of our method and the critical role of incorporating length priors into the TSG
task.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于掩码自编码器（MAEPD）的基础模型，用于解决分布式声学传感（DAS）信号识别中的数据分布差异问题，并通过视觉提示调优（VPT）在下游任务中实现高效微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DAS技术应用广泛，但数据分布差异和标记数据不足限制了AI模型的跨领域泛化能力。

Method: 使用自监督掩码重建任务预训练MAEPD模型，并在下游任务中采用VPT方法微调少量参数。

Result: 在室内步态识别任务中，VPT-Deep方法达到96.94%的分类准确率，仅微调0.322%的参数，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: MAEPD作为一种基础模型，具有通用性、高效性和可扩展性，为DAS信号识别提供了新范式。

Abstract: Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) technology finds growing applications
across various domains. However, data distribution disparities due to
heterogeneous sensing environments pose challenges for data-driven artificial
intelligence (AI) models, limiting cross-domain generalization and facing a
shortage of labeled training data. To address these issues, this study proposes
a foundational model for DAS signal recognition based on a Masked Autoencoder,
named MAEPD. The MAEPD model is pretrained on a dataset of 635,860 samples,
encompassing DAS gait spatiotemporal signals, 2D GASF images for perimeter
security, 2D time-frequency images for pipeline leakage, and open-dataset
signals including whale vocalizations and seismic activities, using a
self-supervised mask reconstruction task to capture deep semantic features of
DAS signals. Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) is employed for downstream recognition
tasks. This method freezes the pretrained backbone parameters and fine-tunes
only a small set of learnable visual prompt vectors inserted into the
Transformer encoder layers. Experiments on the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Super
platform validate MAEPD using indoor gait recognition as a downstream task. The
VPT-Deep approach achieves a classification accuracy of 96.94% with just 0.322%
of parameters fine-tuned, surpassing the traditional Full Fine Tuning (FFT)
method by 0.61% and reducing training time by 45%. The model also exhibits
robust performance in pipeline leakage detection, confirming the generality,
efficiency, and scalability of MAEPD as a foundational model. This approach
offers a novel paradigm for addressing the limited generalization of signal
recognition models in the DAS domain.

Abstract: Recent flow matching models for text-to-image generation have achieved
remarkable quality, yet their integration with reinforcement learning for human
preference alignment remains suboptimal, hindering fine-grained reward-based
optimization. We observe that the key impediment to effective GRPO training of
flow models is the temporal uniformity assumption in existing approaches:
sparse terminal rewards with uniform credit assignment fail to capture the
varying criticality of decisions across generation timesteps, resulting in
inefficient exploration and suboptimal convergence. To remedy this shortcoming,
we introduce \textbf{TempFlow-GRPO} (Temporal Flow GRPO), a principled GRPO
framework that captures and exploits the temporal structure inherent in
flow-based generation. TempFlow-GRPO introduces two key innovations: (i) a
trajectory branching mechanism that provides process rewards by concentrating
stochasticity at designated branching points, enabling precise credit
assignment without requiring specialized intermediate reward models; and (ii) a
noise-aware weighting scheme that modulates policy optimization according to
the intrinsic exploration potential of each timestep, prioritizing learning
during high-impact early stages while ensuring stable refinement in later
phases. These innovations endow the model with temporally-aware optimization
that respects the underlying generative dynamics, leading to state-of-the-art
performance in human preference alignment and standard text-to-image
benchmarks.

Conclusion: RiemanLine是一种高效且统一的3D线表示方法，特别适用于处理并行线结构，为相机定位和结构映射提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Minimal parametrization of 3D lines plays a critical role in camera
localization and structural mapping. Existing representations in robotics and
computer vision predominantly handle independent lines, overlooking structural
regularities such as sets of parallel lines that are pervasive in man-made
environments. This paper introduces \textbf{RiemanLine}, a unified minimal
representation for 3D lines formulated on Riemannian manifolds that jointly
accommodates both individual lines and parallel-line groups. Our key idea is to
decouple each line landmark into global and local components: a shared
vanishing direction optimized on the unit sphere $\mathcal{S}^2$, and scaled
normal vectors constrained on orthogonal subspaces, enabling compact encoding
of structural regularities. For $n$ parallel lines, the proposed representation
reduces the parameter space from $4n$ (orthonormal form) to $2n+2$, naturally
embedding parallelism without explicit constraints. We further integrate this
parameterization into a factor graph framework, allowing global direction
alignment and local reprojection optimization within a unified manifold-based
bundle adjustment. Extensive experiments on ICL-NUIM, TartanAir, and synthetic
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves significantly more accurate
pose estimation and line reconstruction, while reducing parameter
dimensionality and improving convergence stability.

Conclusion: RotatedMVPS在自然光下高效恢复形状和反射率，适用性广。

Abstract: Multiview photometric stereo (MVPS) seeks to recover high-fidelity surface
shapes and reflectances from images captured under varying views and
illuminations. However, existing MVPS methods often require controlled darkroom
settings for varying illuminations or overlook the recovery of reflectances and
illuminations properties, limiting their applicability in natural illumination
scenarios and downstream inverse rendering tasks. In this paper, we propose
RotatedMVPS to solve shape and reflectance recovery under rotated natural
light, achievable with a practical rotation stage. By ensuring light
consistency across different camera and object poses, our method reduces the
unknowns associated with complex environment light. Furthermore, we integrate
data priors from off-the-shelf learning-based single-view photometric stereo
methods into our MVPS framework, significantly enhancing the accuracy of shape
and reflectance recovery. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: TSPO通过强化学习有效提升了MLLMs对长视频的理解能力，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
progress in vision-language tasks, yet they still face challenges when
processing long-duration video inputs. The limitation arises from MLLMs'
context limit and training costs, necessitating sparse frame sampling before
feeding videos into MLLMs. Existing video MLLMs adopt training-free uniform
sampling or keyframe search, which may miss critical events or be constrained
by the pre-trained models' event understanding capabilities. Meanwhile,
building a training-based method remains challenging due to the unsupervised
and non-differentiable nature of sparse frame sampling. To address these
problems, we propose Temporal Sampling Policy Optimization (TSPO), advancing
MLLMs' long-form video-language understanding via reinforcement learning.
Specifically, we first propose a trainable event-aware temporal agent, which
captures event-query correlation for performing probabilistic keyframe
selection. Then, we propose the TSPO reinforcement learning paradigm, which
models keyframe selection and language generation as a joint decision-making
process, enabling end-to-end group relative optimization with efficient
rule-based rewards. Furthermore, for the TSPO's training, we propose a long
video training data construction pipeline with comprehensive temporal data and
video Needle-in-a-Haystack data. Finally, we incorporate rule-based answering
accuracy and temporal locating reward mechanisms to optimize the temporal
sampling policy. Comprehensive experiments show that our TSPO achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple long video understanding
benchmarks, and shows transferable ability across different cutting-edge
Video-MLLMs.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that vision models pre-trained on images can
perform well in time series forecasting by reformulating forecasting as an
image reconstruction task, suggesting their potential as universal time series
foundation models. However, effective cross-modal transfer from vision to time
series remains challenging due to three key discrepancies: (1) data-modality
gap between structured, bounded image data and unbounded, heterogeneous time
series; (2) multivariate-forecasting gap between standard RGB
three-channel-based vision models and the need to model time series with
arbitrary numbers of variates; and (3) probabilistic-forecasting gap between
the deterministic output formats of most vision models and the requirement for
uncertainty-aware probabilistic predictions. To bridge these gaps, we propose
VisionTS++, a vision-model-based TSFM that performs continual pre-training on
large-scale time series datasets, including 3 innovations: (1) a
vision-model-based filtering mechanism to identify high-quality time series
data, thereby mitigating modality gap and improving pre-training stability, (2)
a colorized multivariate conversion method that transforms multivariate time
series into multi-subfigure RGB images, capturing complex inter-variate
dependencies; and (3) a multi-quantile forecasting approach using parallel
reconstruction heads to generate forecasts of different quantile levels, thus
more flexibly approximating arbitrary output distributions without restrictive
prior distributional assumptions. Evaluated on both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution TSF benchmarks, \model achieves SOTA results, outperforming
specialized TSFMs by 6%-44% in MSE reduction and ranking first in 9 out of 12
probabilistic forecasting settings. Our work establishes a new paradigm for
cross-modal knowledge transfer, advancing the development of universal TSFMs.

Conclusion: ProtoN在少样本耳部识别中表现出色，有效解决了数据稀缺和类内变异问题。

Abstract: Ear biometrics offer a stable and contactless modality for identity
recognition, yet their effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of
annotated data and significant intra-class variability. Existing methods
typically extract identity features from individual impressions in isolation,
restricting their ability to capture consistent and discriminative
representations. To overcome these limitations, a few-shot learning framework,
ProtoN, is proposed to jointly process multiple impressions of an identity
using a graph-based approach. Each impression is represented as a node in a
class-specific graph, alongside a learnable prototype node that encodes
identity-level information. This graph is processed by a Prototype Graph Neural
Network (PGNN) layer, specifically designed to refine both impression and
prototype representations through a dual-path message-passing mechanism. To
further enhance discriminative power, the PGNN incorporates a cross-graph
prototype alignment strategy that improves class separability by enforcing
intra-class compactness while maintaining inter-class distinction.
Additionally, a hybrid loss function is employed to balance episodic and global
classification objectives, thereby improving the overall structure of the
embedding space. Extensive experiments on five benchmark ear datasets
demonstrate that ProtoN achieves state-of-the-art performance, with Rank-1
identification accuracy of up to 99.60% and an Equal Error Rate (EER) as low as
0.025, showing the effectiveness for few-shot ear recognition under limited
data conditions.

Abstract: Renovating existing buildings is essential for climate impact. Early-phase
renovation planning requires simulations based on thermal 3D models at Level of
Detail (LoD) 3, which include features like windows. However, scalable and
accurate identification of such features remains a challenge. This paper
presents the Scalable Image-to-3D Facade Parser (SI3FP), a pipeline that
generates LoD3 thermal models by extracting geometries from images using both
computer vision and deep learning. Unlike existing methods relying on
segmentation and projection, SI3FP directly models geometric primitives in the
orthographic image plane, providing a unified interface while reducing
perspective distortions. SI3FP supports both sparse (e.g., Google Street View)
and dense (e.g., hand-held camera) data sources. Tested on typical Swedish
residential buildings, SI3FP achieved approximately 5% error in window-to-wall
ratio estimates, demonstrating sufficient accuracy for early-stage renovation
analysis. The pipeline facilitates large-scale energy renovation planning and
has broader applications in urban development and planning.

Abstract: The video reasoning ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is
crucial for downstream tasks like video question answering and temporal
grounding. While recent approaches have explored text-based chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning for MLLMs, these methods often suffer from limited cross-modal
interaction and increased hallucination, especially with longer videos or
reasoning chains. To address these challenges, we propose Video Intelligence
via Tool-Augmented Learning (VITAL), a novel end-to-end agentic video reasoning
framework. With a visual toolbox, the model can densely sample new video frames
on demand and generate multimodal CoT for precise long video reasoning. We
observe that temporal grounding and question answering are mutually beneficial
for video understanding tasks. Therefore, we construct two high-quality
multi-task video reasoning datasets MTVR-CoT-72k for supervised fine-tuning and
MTVR-RL-110k for reinforcement learning. Moreover, we propose a
Difficulty-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm (DGRPO) to
mitigate difficulty imbalance in multi-task reinforcement learning. Extensive
experiments on 11 challenging video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the
advanced reasoning ability of VITAL, outperforming existing methods in video
question answering and temporal grounding tasks, especially in long video
scenarios. All code, data and model weight will be made publicly available.

Method: 提出Deformable Inter-Task Self-Attention，高效聚合不同任务的特征图信息。

Result: 在NYUD-v2和PASCAL-Context数据集上，计算量（FLOPs）和推理延迟降低了一个数量级，同时任务预测质量指标提升高达7.4%。

Abstract: In both Computer Vision and the wider Deep Learning field, the Transformer
architecture is well-established as state-of-the-art for many applications. For
Multitask Learning, however, where there may be many more queries necessary
compared to single-task models, its Multi-Head-Attention often approaches the
limits of what is computationally feasible considering practical hardware
limitations. This is due to the fact that the size of the attention matrix
scales quadratically with the number of tasks (assuming roughly equal numbers
of queries for all tasks). As a solution, we propose our novel Deformable
Inter-Task Self-Attention for Multitask models that enables the much more
efficient aggregation of information across the feature maps from different
tasks. In our experiments on the NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context datasets, we
demonstrate an order-of-magnitude reduction in both FLOPs count and inference
latency. At the same time, we also achieve substantial improvements by up to
7.4% in the individual tasks' prediction quality metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新任务Composed Object Retrieval (COR)，通过结合参考对象和检索文本实现对象级检索与分割，并构建了大规模基准COR127K和统一模型CORE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法局限于图像级匹配，无法定位特定对象，COR任务旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出COR任务，构建COR127K基准，开发CORE模型，集成参考区域编码、自适应视觉-文本交互和区域级对比学习。

Result: CORE在基础和新增类别上显著优于现有模型，为细粒度多模态检索研究提供了有效基线。

Conclusion: COR任务为细粒度多模态检索开辟了新方向，CORE模型展示了其潜力。

Abstract: Retrieving fine-grained visual content based on user intent remains a
challenge in multi-modal systems. Although current Composed Image Retrieval
(CIR) methods combine reference images with retrieval texts, they are
constrained to image-level matching and cannot localize specific objects. To
this end, we propose Composed Object Retrieval (COR), a brand-new task that
goes beyond image-level retrieval to achieve object-level precision, allowing
the retrieval and segmentation of target objects based on composed expressions
combining reference objects and retrieval texts. COR presents significant
challenges in retrieval flexibility, which requires systems to identify
arbitrary objects satisfying composed expressions while avoiding semantically
similar but irrelevant negative objects within the same scene. We construct
COR127K, the first large-scale COR benchmark that contains 127,166 retrieval
triplets with various semantic transformations in 408 categories. We also
present CORE, a unified end-to-end model that integrates reference region
encoding, adaptive visual-textual interaction, and region-level contrastive
learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CORE significantly outperforms
existing models in both base and novel categories, establishing a simple and
effective baseline for this challenging task while opening new directions for
fine-grained multi-modal retrieval research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决病理学中标记数据有限的问题，利用自监督学习训练的基础模型提升分类任务性能。

Method: 比较了线性探测和LoRA适应基础模型的方法，并与端到端训练的CNN和Vision Transformers基线模型对比。

Result: LoRA适应模型在仅10%训练数据下接近100%数据可用性的性能，且对未见肿瘤域表现优异。

Conclusion: LoRA适应基础模型在数据效率和跨域性能上表现突出，但传统架构的全微调仍具竞争力。

Abstract: The performance of deep learning models is known to scale with data quantity
and diversity. In pathology, as in many other medical imaging domains, the
availability of labeled images for a specific task is often limited.
Self-supervised learning techniques have enabled the use of vast amounts of
unlabeled data to train large-scale neural networks, i.e., foundation models,
that can address the limited data problem by providing semantically rich
feature vectors that can generalize well to new tasks with minimal training
effort increasing model performance and robustness. In this work, we
investigate the use of foundation models for mitotic figure classification. The
mitotic count, which can be derived from this classification task, is an
independent prognostic marker for specific tumors and part of certain tumor
grading systems. In particular, we investigate the data scaling laws on
multiple current foundation models and evaluate their robustness to unseen
tumor domains. Next to the commonly used linear probing paradigm, we also adapt
the models using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) of their attention mechanisms. We
compare all models against end-to-end-trained baselines, both CNNs and Vision
Transformers. Our results demonstrate that LoRA-adapted foundation models
provide superior performance to those adapted with standard linear probing,
reaching performance levels close to 100% data availability with only 10% of
training data. Furthermore, LoRA-adaptation of the most recent foundation
models almost closes the out-of-domain performance gap when evaluated on unseen
tumor domains. However, full fine-tuning of traditional architectures still
yields competitive performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于因果驱动的视觉对象补全（CVC）任务的自我改进框架，以提升大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）在视觉感知和推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型视觉语言模型在需要深度视觉感知的任务中表现不足，主要原因是流行指令调优语料库中视觉知识的稀缺。

Method: 通过自动化实例构建管道生成丰富的CVC任务示例，无需依赖复杂模型或人工辅助，LVLM通过试错学习自我改进。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在四个专业任务和四个综合基准上均取得显著提升，特别是在专业任务中平均提升5.4%（LLaVA-1.5-7B）和4.0%（LLaVA-1.5-13B）。

Conclusion: 提出的CVC任务和自我改进框架有效提升了LVLM的视觉感知和推理能力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have experienced significant
advancements in recent years. However, their performance still falls short in
tasks requiring deep visual perception, such as identifying subtle differences
between images. A potential cause is the scarcity of visual knowledge in
popular instruction-tuning corpora, resulting in inadequate visual perception
and reasoning capabilities. To address this challenge, we introduce a
self-improvement framework grounded in a novel visual knowledge-intensive task,
\underline{C}ausality-driven \underline{V}isual object \underline{C}ompletion
(CVC). This task requires LVLMs to infer the masked object in an image based on
its \textit{causal} relationships with the other visible information. We first
obtain rich examples cheaply through our automated instance construction
pipeline, without relying on sophisticated LVLMs (\textit{e.g.}, GPT-4V) or
human assistance. Then, LVLMs effectively self-improve through trial and error
learning using these created instances. Our experiments demonstrate substantial
gains across four challenging specialized tasks and four widely-used
comprehensive benchmarks. Especially on specialized tasks, our method achieves
an average improvement of 5.4\% and 4.0\% compared to the corresponding
baselines when utilizing LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-1.5-13B, respectively. The code

TL;DR: 4DVD是一种级联视频扩散模型，通过解耦方式生成4D内容，分为粗布局生成和结构感知条件生成两个子任务，显著提升了4D生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接生成高维数据（如4D）复杂度高，现有方法难以同时建模3D空间和时间特征。

Method: 4DVD将任务解耦为粗多视图布局生成和结构感知条件生成，并统一两者。基于单目视频生成布局先验，再结合外观内容生成高质量密集视图视频。

Result: 实验表明，4DVD在新视角合成和4D生成上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 4DVD通过解耦和统一策略，实现了高质量的4D内容生成，并支持显式4D表示优化。

Abstract: Given the high complexity of directly generating high-dimensional data such
as 4D, we present 4DVD, a cascaded video diffusion model that generates 4D
content in a decoupled manner. Unlike previous multi-view video methods that
directly model 3D space and temporal features simultaneously with stacked cross
view/temporal attention modules, 4DVD decouples this into two subtasks: coarse
multi-view layout generation and structure-aware conditional generation, and
effectively unifies them. Specifically, given a monocular video, 4DVD first
predicts the dense view content of its layout with superior cross-view and
temporal consistency. Based on the produced layout priors, a structure-aware
spatio-temporal generation branch is developed, combining these coarse
structural priors with the exquisite appearance content of input monocular
video to generate final high-quality dense-view videos. Benefit from this,
explicit 4D representation~(such as 4D Gaussian) can be optimized accurately,
enabling wider practical application. To train 4DVD, we collect a dynamic 3D
object dataset, called D-Objaverse, from the Objaverse benchmark and render 16
videos with 21 frames for each object. Extensive experiments demonstrate our
state-of-the-art performance on both novel view synthesis and 4D generation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ErasePro的新方法，旨在更彻底地消除预训练文本到图像模型中的有害概念，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在消除有害概念时存在不完全擦除和生成质量下降的问题，需要一种更高效且不影响生成质量的方法。

Method: ErasePro通过引入零残差约束和渐进式分层更新策略，确保目标概念与无害概念完美对齐，并减少对深层参数的修改。

Result: 实验证明，ErasePro在不同概念擦除任务中表现优异，实现了更彻底的擦除并保持了生成质量。

Conclusion: ErasePro为概念擦除任务提供了一种高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Concept Erasure, which aims to prevent pretrained text-to-image models from
generating content associated with semantic-harmful concepts (i.e., target
concepts), is getting increased attention. State-of-the-art methods formulate
this task as an optimization problem: they align all target concepts with
semantic-harmless anchor concepts, and apply closed-form solutions to update
the model accordingly. While these closed-form methods are efficient, we argue
that existing methods have two overlooked limitations: 1) They often result in
incomplete erasure due to "non-zero alignment residual", especially when text
prompts are relatively complex. 2) They may suffer from generation quality
degradation as they always concentrate parameter updates in a few deep layers.
To address these issues, we propose a novel closed-form method ErasePro: it is
designed for more complete concept erasure and better preserving overall
generative quality. Specifically, ErasePro first introduces a strict
zero-residual constraint into the optimization objective, ensuring perfect
alignment between target and anchor concept features and enabling more complete
erasure. Secondly, it employs a progressive, layer-wise update strategy that
gradually transfers target concept features to those of the anchor concept from
shallow to deep layers. As the depth increases, the required parameter changes
diminish, thereby reducing deviations in sensitive deep layers and preserving
generative quality. Empirical results across different concept erasure tasks
(including instance, art style, and nudity erasure) have demonstrated the
effectiveness of our ErasePro.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuantVSR是一种针对真实世界视频超分辨率（VSR）的低比特量化模型，通过时空复杂度感知机制和可学习偏置对齐模块，解决了量化VSR模型的挑战，并在性能上优于现有低比特量化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在视频超分辨率中表现出色，但其处理速度慢和资源消耗大限制了实际应用。量化是压缩VSR模型的潜在解决方案，但量化VSR模型因时间特性和高保真要求而具有挑战性。

Method: 提出QuantVSR，采用时空复杂度感知（STCA）机制，通过校准数据集测量每层的时空复杂度，分配层特定秩，并联合优化全精度和低比特分支。此外，引入可学习偏置对齐（LBA）模块减少量化误差。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，QuantVSR性能与全精度模型相当，并显著优于现有低比特量化方法。

Conclusion: QuantVSR通过STCA和LBA模块，有效解决了VSR模型量化问题，为实际应用提供了高效且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown superior performance in real-world video
super-resolution (VSR). However, the slow processing speeds and heavy resource
consumption of diffusion models hinder their practical application and
deployment. Quantization offers a potential solution for compressing the VSR
model. Nevertheless, quantizing VSR models is challenging due to their temporal
characteristics and high fidelity requirements. To address these issues, we
propose QuantVSR, a low-bit quantization model for real-world VSR. We propose a
spatio-temporal complexity aware (STCA) mechanism, where we first utilize the
calibration dataset to measure both spatial and temporal complexities for each
layer. Based on these statistics, we allocate layer-specific ranks to the
low-rank full-precision (FP) auxiliary branch. Subsequently, we jointly refine
the FP and low-bit branches to achieve simultaneous optimization. In addition,
we propose a learnable bias alignment (LBA) module to reduce the biased
quantization errors. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method obtains comparable performance with the FP model
and significantly outperforms recent leading low-bit quantization methods. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注场景变量的因果表示，而较少关注干预本身的表示。本文旨在通过干预表示提升模型的分布外（OOD）鲁棒性。

Method: 提出因果增量嵌入（Causal Delta Embedding），该嵌入对视觉场景不变且稀疏影响因果变量。通过无监督学习框架从图像对中学习因果表示。

Result: 在Causal Triplet挑战中，因果增量嵌入在合成和真实世界基准测试中显著优于基线性能。

Conclusion: 因果增量嵌入是提升OOD鲁棒性的有效策略，尤其在无监督学习场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Causal representation learning has attracted significant research interest
during the past few years, as a means for improving model generalization and
robustness. Causal representations of interventional image pairs, have the
property that only variables corresponding to scene elements affected by the
intervention / action are changed between the start state and the end state.
While most work in this area has focused on identifying and representing the
variables of the scene under a causal model, fewer efforts have focused on
representations of the interventions themselves. In this work, we show that an
effective strategy for improving out of distribution (OOD) robustness is to
focus on the representation of interventions in the latent space. Specifically,
we propose that an intervention can be represented by a Causal Delta Embedding
that is invariant to the visual scene and sparse in terms of the causal
variables it affects. Leveraging this insight, we propose a framework that is
capable of learning causal representations from image pairs, without any
additional supervision. Experiments in the Causal Triplet challenge demonstrate
that Causal Delta Embeddings are highly effective in OOD settings,
significantly exceeding baseline performance in both synthetic and real-world
benchmarks.

Conclusion: MonoCloth通过部件化设计和专用模块，显著提升了单目视频中人体化身的重建和动画效果，具有实用性和多功能性。

Abstract: Reconstructing realistic 3D human avatars from monocular videos is a
challenging task due to the limited geometric information and complex non-rigid
motion involved. We present MonoCloth, a new method for reconstructing and
animating clothed human avatars from monocular videos. To overcome the
limitations of monocular input, we introduce a part-based decomposition
strategy that separates the avatar into body, face, hands, and clothing. This
design reflects the varying levels of reconstruction difficulty and deformation
complexity across these components. Specifically, we focus on detailed geometry
recovery for the face and hands. For clothing, we propose a dedicated cloth
simulation module that captures garment deformation using temporal motion cues
and geometric constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that MonoCloth
improves both visual reconstruction quality and animation realism compared to
existing methods. Furthermore, thanks to its part-based design, MonoCloth also
supports additional tasks such as clothing transfer, underscoring its
versatility and practical utility.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art methods for skeleton-based temporal action
segmentation are predominantly supervised and require annotated data, which is
expensive to collect. In contrast, existing unsupervised temporal action
segmentation methods have focused primarily on video data, while skeleton
sequences remain underexplored, despite their relevance to real-world
applications, robustness, and privacy-preserving nature. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach for unsupervised skeleton-based temporal action
segmentation. Our method utilizes a sequence-to-sequence temporal autoencoder
that keeps the information of the different joints disentangled in the
embedding space. Latent skeleton sequences are then divided into
non-overlapping patches and quantized to obtain distinctive skeleton motion
words, driving the discovery of semantically meaningful action clusters. We
thoroughly evaluate the proposed approach on three widely used skeleton-based
datasets, namely HuGaDB, LARa, and BABEL. The results demonstrate that our
model outperforms the current state-of-the-art unsupervised temporal action
segmentation methods. Code is available at https://github.com/bachlab/SMQ .

Conclusion: RAIDX是首个统一RAG和GRPO的框架，填补了深度伪造检测在准确性和可解释性方面的关键空白。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-generation models has enabled the creation of
hyperrealistic imagery, posing ethical risks through widespread misinformation.
Current deepfake detection methods, categorized as face specific detectors or
general AI-generated detectors, lack transparency by framing detection as a
classification task without explaining decisions. While several LLM-based
approaches offer explainability, they suffer from coarse-grained analyses and
dependency on labor-intensive annotations. This paper introduces RAIDX
(Retrieval-Augmented Image Deepfake Detection and Explainability), a novel
deepfake detection framework integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance detection accuracy and
decision explainability. Specifically, RAIDX leverages RAG to incorporate
external knowledge for improved detection accuracy and employs GRPO to
autonomously generate fine-grained textual explanations and saliency maps,
eliminating the need for extensive manual annotations. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate RAIDX's effectiveness in identifying real or fake, and
providing interpretable rationales in both textual descriptions and saliency
maps, achieving state-of-the-art detection performance while advancing
transparency in deepfake identification. RAIDX represents the first unified
framework to synergize RAG and GRPO, addressing critical gaps in accuracy and
explainability. Our code and models will be publicly available.

Result: 在多个数据集（CIFAR-100、ImageNet等）上的实验表明，TopKD优于现有蒸馏方法，且在Vision Transformers上表现突出。

Conclusion: TopKD展示了logit在知识蒸馏中的潜力，是一种简单高效且通用的框架。

Abstract: Recent advances in knowledge distillation (KD) predominantly emphasize
feature-level knowledge transfer, frequently overlooking critical information
embedded within the teacher's logit distributions. In this paper, we revisit
logit-based distillation and reveal an underexplored yet critical element:
Top-K knowledge. Motivated by this insight, we propose Top-scaled Knowledge
Distillation (TopKD), a simple, efficient, and architecture-agnostic framework
that significantly enhances logit-based distillation. TopKD consists of two
main components: (1) a Top-K Scaling Module (TSM), which adaptively amplifies
the most informative logits, and (2) a Top-K Decoupled Loss (TDL), which offers
targeted and effective supervision. Notably, TopKD integrates seamlessly into
existing KD methods without introducing extra modules or requiring
architectural changes. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, ImageNet, STL-10,
and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that TopKD consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art distillation methods. Moreover, our method demonstrates
substantial effectiveness when distilling Vision Transformers, underscoring its
versatility across diverse network architectures. These findings highlight the
significant potential of logits to advance knowledge distillation.

Abstract: We present InceptoFormer, a multi-signal neural framework designed for
Parkinson's Disease (PD) severity evaluation via gait dynamics analysis. Our
architecture introduces a 1D adaptation of the Inception model, which we refer
to as Inception1D, along with a Transformer-based framework to stage PD
severity according to the Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) scale. The Inception1D component
captures multi-scale temporal features by employing parallel 1D convolutional
filters with varying kernel sizes, thereby extracting features across multiple
temporal scales. The transformer component efficiently models long-range
dependencies within gait sequences, providing a comprehensive understanding of
both local and global patterns. To address the issue of class imbalance in PD
severity staging, we propose a data structuring and preprocessing strategy
based on oversampling to enhance the representation of underrepresented
severity levels. The overall design enables to capture fine-grained temporal
variations and global dynamics in gait signal, significantly improving
classification performance for PD severity evaluation. Through extensive
experimentation, InceptoFormer achieves an accuracy of 96.6%, outperforming
existing state-of-the-art methods in PD severity assessment. The source code

Result: 在TACoS、ActivityNet Captions和MAD数据集上取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 分层事件记忆方法有效解决了OnVTG任务中的事件建模和长期信息保留问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the task of online video temporal grounding (OnVTG),
which requires the model to locate events related to a given text query within
a video stream. Unlike regular video temporal grounding, OnVTG requires the
model to make predictions without observing future frames. As online videos are
streaming inputs and can go on indefinitely, it is impractical and inefficient
to store all historical inputs. The existing OnVTG models employ memory to
store recent historical video frame features and predict scores indicating
whether the current frame corresponds to the start or end time of the target
event. However, these methods lack effective event modeling and cannot retain
long-term historical information, leading to low performance. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a hierarchical event memory for OnVTG. We propose an
event-based OnVTG framework that makes predictions based on event proposals
that model event-level information with various durations. To preserve
historically valuable event information, we introduce a hierarchical event
memory that retains historical events, allowing the model to access both recent
and long-term information. To enable the real-time prediction, we further
propose a future prediction branch that predicts whether the target event will

Abstract: Marine videos present significant challenges for video understanding due to
the dynamics of marine objects and the surrounding environment, camera motion,
and the complexity of underwater scenes. Existing video captioning datasets,
typically focused on generic or human-centric domains, often fail to generalize
to the complexities of the marine environment and gain insights about marine
life. To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage marine
object-oriented video captioning pipeline. We introduce a comprehensive video
understanding benchmark that leverages the triplets of video, text, and
segmentation masks to facilitate visual grounding and captioning, leading to
improved marine video understanding and analysis, and marine video generation.
Additionally, we highlight the effectiveness of video splitting in order to
detect salient object transitions in scene changes, which significantly enrich
the semantics of captioning content. Our dataset and code have been released at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种双向服装转移模型（TWGTM），首次统一解决了虚拟试穿（VTON）和虚拟试脱（VTOFF）任务，通过双向特征解耦和分阶段训练实现了互补性。

Motivation: 当前虚拟试穿和虚拟试脱任务被孤立处理，缺乏对两者互补性的系统性研究。本文旨在填补这一空白，提出统一框架。

Method: 采用双向特征解耦和双条件引导（潜在空间和像素空间），并设计分阶段训练以解决掩模依赖不对称问题。

Result: 在DressCode和VITON-HD数据集上的实验验证了模型的有效性和竞争力。

Conclusion: TWGTM是首个统一解决VTON和VTOFF任务的框架，展示了双向任务的互补性和实际应用潜力。

Abstract: While recent advances in virtual try-on (VTON) have achieved realistic
garment transfer to human subjects, its inverse task, virtual try-off (VTOFF),
which aims to reconstruct canonical garment templates from dressed humans,
remains critically underexplored and lacks systematic investigation. Existing
works predominantly treat them as isolated tasks: VTON focuses on garment
dressing while VTOFF addresses garment extraction, thereby neglecting their
complementary symmetry. To bridge this fundamental gap, we propose the Two-Way
Garment Transfer Model (TWGTM), to the best of our knowledge, the first unified
framework for joint clothing-centric image synthesis that simultaneously
resolves both mask-guided VTON and mask-free VTOFF through bidirectional
feature disentanglement. Specifically, our framework employs dual-conditioned
guidance from both latent and pixel spaces of reference images to seamlessly
bridge the dual tasks. On the other hand, to resolve the inherent mask
dependency asymmetry between mask-guided VTON and mask-free VTOFF, we devise a
phased training paradigm that progressively bridges this modality gap.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted across the
DressCode and VITON-HD datasets validate the efficacy and competitive edge of
our proposed approach.

Abstract: As the leading cause of death worldwide, cardiovascular diseases motivate the
development of more sophisticated methods to analyze the heart and its
substructures from medical images like Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic
Resonance (MR). Semantic segmentations of important cardiac structures that
represent the whole heart are useful to assess patient-specific cardiac
morphology and pathology. Furthermore, accurate semantic segmentations can be
used to generate cardiac digital twin models which allows e.g.
electrophysiological simulation and personalized therapy planning. Even though
deep learning-based methods for medical image segmentation achieved great
advancements over the last decade, retaining good performance under domain
shift -- i.e. when training and test data are sampled from different data
distributions -- remains challenging. In order to perform well on domains known
at training-time, we employ a (1) balanced joint training approach that
utilizes CT and MR data in equal amounts from different source domains.
Further, aiming to alleviate domain shift towards domains only encountered at
test-time, we rely on (2) strong intensity and spatial augmentation techniques
to greatly diversify the available training data. Our proposed whole heart
segmentation method, a 5-fold ensemble with our contributions, achieves the
best performance for MR data overall and a performance similar to the best
performance for CT data when compared to a model trained solely on CT. With
93.33% DSC and 0.8388 mm ASSD for CT and 89.30% DSC and 1.2411 mm ASSD for MR
data, our method demonstrates great potential to efficiently obtain accurate
semantic segmentations from which patient-specific cardiac twin models can be
generated.

Conclusion: OMFA为虚拟服装合成提供了实用且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based approaches have made significant advances in
image-based virtual try-on, enabling more realistic and end-to-end garment
synthesis. However, most existing methods remain constrained by their reliance
on exhibition garments and segmentation masks, as well as their limited ability
to handle flexible pose variations. These limitations reduce their practicality
in real-world scenarios-for instance, users cannot easily transfer garments
worn by one person onto another, and the generated try-on results are typically
restricted to the same pose as the reference image. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{OMFA} (\emph{One Model For All}), a unified diffusion framework for
both virtual try-on and try-off that operates without the need for exhibition
garments and supports arbitrary poses. For example, OMFA enables removing
garments from a source person (try-off) and transferring them onto a target
person (try-on), while also allowing the generated target to appear in novel
poses-even without access to multi-pose images of that person. OMFA is built
upon a novel \emph{partial diffusion} strategy that selectively applies noise
and denoising to individual components of the joint input-such as the garment,
the person image, or the face-enabling dynamic subtask control and efficient
bidirectional garment-person transformation. The framework is entirely
mask-free and requires only a single portrait and a target pose as input,
making it well-suited for real-world applications. Additionally, by leveraging
SMPL-X-based pose conditioning, OMFA supports multi-view and arbitrary-pose
try-on from just one image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OMFA
achieves state-of-the-art results on both try-on and try-off tasks, providing a
practical and generalizable solution for virtual garment synthesis. The project

Abstract: The diffusion of drones presents significant security and safety challenges.
Traditional surveillance systems, particularly conventional frame-based
cameras, struggle to reliably detect these targets due to their small size,
high agility, and the resulting motion blur and poor performance in challenging
lighting conditions. This paper surveys the emerging field of event-based
vision as a robust solution to these problems. Event cameras virtually
eliminate motion blur and enable consistent detection in extreme lighting.
Their sparse, asynchronous output suppresses static backgrounds, enabling
low-latency focus on motion cues. We review the state-of-the-art in event-based
drone detection, from data representation methods to advanced processing
pipelines using spiking neural networks. The discussion extends beyond simple
detection to cover more sophisticated tasks such as real-time tracking,
trajectory forecasting, and unique identification through propeller signature
analysis. By examining current methodologies, available datasets, and the
distinct advantages of the technology, this work demonstrates that event-based
vision provides a powerful foundation for the next generation of reliable,
low-latency, and efficient counter-UAV systems.

Conclusion: TAlignDiff为牙齿矫正治疗提供了更优的自动对齐方案。

Abstract: Orthodontic treatment hinges on tooth alignment, which significantly affects
occlusal function, facial aesthetics, and patients' quality of life. Current
deep learning approaches predominantly concentrate on predicting transformation
matrices through imposing point-to-point geometric constraints for tooth
alignment. Nevertheless, these matrices are likely associated with the
anatomical structure of the human oral cavity and possess particular
distribution characteristics that the deterministic point-to-point geometric
constraints in prior work fail to capture. To address this, we introduce a new
automatic tooth alignment method named TAlignDiff, which is supported by
diffusion-based transformation learning. TAlignDiff comprises two main
components: a primary point cloud-based regression network (PRN) and a
diffusion-based transformation matrix denoising module (DTMD).
Geometry-constrained losses supervise PRN learning for point cloud-level
alignment. DTMD, as an auxiliary module, learns the latent distribution of
transformation matrices from clinical data. We integrate point cloud-based
transformation regression and diffusion-based transformation modeling into a
unified framework, allowing bidirectional feedback between geometric
constraints and diffusion refinement. Extensive ablation and comparative
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method,
highlighting its potential in orthodontic treatment.

Conclusion: 该方法通过跨模态显著锚点和弱监督机制，显著提升了视听事件定位的准确性。

Abstract: The Dense Audio-Visual Event Localization (DAVEL) task aims to temporally
localize events in untrimmed videos that occur simultaneously in both the audio
and visual modalities. This paper explores DAVEL under a new and more
challenging weakly-supervised setting (W-DAVEL task), where only video-level
event labels are provided and the temporal boundaries of each event are
unknown. We address W-DAVEL by exploiting \textit{cross-modal salient anchors},
which are defined as reliable timestamps that are well predicted under weak
supervision and exhibit highly consistent event semantics across audio and
visual modalities. Specifically, we propose a \textit{Mutual Event Agreement
Evaluation} module, which generates an agreement score by measuring the
discrepancy between the predicted audio and visual event classes. Then, the
agreement score is utilized in a \textit{Cross-modal Salient Anchor
Identification} module, which identifies the audio and visual anchor features
through global-video and local temporal window identification mechanisms. The
anchor features after multimodal integration are fed into an
\textit{Anchor-based Temporal Propagation} module to enhance event semantic
encoding in the original temporal audio and visual features, facilitating
better temporal localization under weak supervision. We establish benchmarks
for W-DAVEL on both the UnAV-100 and ActivityNet1.3 datasets. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: This paper presents DDTracking, a novel deep generative framework for
diffusion MRI tractography that formulates streamline propagation as a
conditional denoising diffusion process. In DDTracking, we introduce a
dual-pathway encoding network that jointly models local spatial encoding
(capturing fine-scale structural details at each streamline point) and global
temporal dependencies (ensuring long-range consistency across the entire
streamline). Furthermore, we design a conditional diffusion model module, which
leverages the learned local and global embeddings to predict streamline
propagation orientations for tractography in an end-to-end trainable manner. We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation across diverse, independently acquired dMRI
datasets, including both synthetic and clinical data. Experiments on two
well-established benchmarks with ground truth (ISMRM Challenge and
TractoInferno) demonstrate that DDTracking largely outperforms current
state-of-the-art tractography methods. Furthermore, our results highlight
DDTracking's strong generalizability across heterogeneous datasets, spanning
varying health conditions, age groups, imaging protocols, and scanner types.
Collectively, DDTracking offers anatomically plausible and robust tractography,
presenting a scalable, adaptable, and end-to-end learnable solution for broad
dMRI applications. Code is available at:

Conclusion: K2Sight通过结构化知识监督，实现高效训练小型模型，性能优异，资源消耗低。

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of grounding abnormalities in medical
images, where the goal is to localize clinical findings based on textual
descriptions. While generalist Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in natural
grounding tasks, they often struggle in the medical domain due to rare,
compositional, and domain-specific terms that are poorly aligned with visual
patterns. Specialized medical VLMs address this challenge via large-scale
domain pretraining, but at the cost of substantial annotation and computational
resources. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{Knowledge to Sight
(K2Sight)}, a framework that introduces structured semantic supervision by
decomposing clinical concepts into interpretable visual attributes, such as
shape, density, and anatomical location. These attributes are distilled from
domain ontologies and encoded into concise instruction-style prompts, which
guide region-text alignment during training. Unlike conventional report-level
supervision, our approach explicitly bridges domain knowledge and spatial
structure, enabling data-efficient training of compact models. We train compact
models with 0.23B and 2B parameters using only 1.5\% of the data required by
state-of-the-art medical VLMs. Despite their small size and limited training
data, these models achieve performance on par with or better than 7B+ medical
VLMs, with up to 9.82\% improvement in $mAP_{50}$. Code and models:

Abstract: Accurate skin disease classification is a critical yet challenging task due
to high inter-class similarity, intra-class variability, and complex lesion
textures. While deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have
shown promise in automating dermatological assessments, their performance is
highly dependent on image pre-processing and model architecture. This study
proposes a deep learning framework for multi-class skin disease classification,
systematically evaluating three image pre-processing techniques: standard RGB,
CMY color space transformation, and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram
Equalization (CLAHE). We benchmark the performance of pre-trained convolutional
neural networks (DenseNet201, Efficient-NetB5) and transformer-based models
(ViT, Swin Transformer, DinoV2 Large) using accuracy and F1-score as evaluation
metrics. Results show that DinoV2 with RGB pre-processing achieves the highest
accuracy (up to 93%) and F1-scores across all variants. Grad-CAM visualizations
applied to RGB inputs further reveal precise lesion localization, enhancing
interpretability. These findings underscore the importance of effective
pre-processing and model choice in building robust and explainable CAD systems
for dermatology.

Result: 在Replica和TUM-RGBD数据集上表现与SplaTAM相当，跟踪时间减少90%以上。

Conclusion: 该方法通过快速网络推理替代慢速优化，显著提升了3D重建的效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Incrementally recovering real-sized 3D geometry from a pose-free RGB stream
is a challenging task in 3D reconstruction, requiring minimal assumptions on
input data. Existing methods can be broadly categorized into end-to-end and
visual SLAM-based approaches, both of which either struggle with long sequences
or depend on slow test-time optimization and depth sensors. To address this, we
first integrate a depth estimator into an RGB-D SLAM system, but this approach
is hindered by inaccurate geometric details in predicted depth. Through further
investigation, we find that 3D Gaussian mapping can effectively solve this
problem. Building on this, we propose an online 3D reconstruction method using
3D Gaussian-based SLAM, combined with a feed-forward recurrent prediction
module to directly infer camera pose from optical flow. This approach replaces
slow test-time optimization with fast network inference, significantly
improving tracking speed. Additionally, we introduce a local graph rendering
technique to enhance robustness in feed-forward pose prediction. Experimental
results on the Replica and TUM-RGBD datasets, along with a real-world
deployment demonstration, show that our method achieves performance on par with
the state-of-the-art SplaTAM, while reducing tracking time by more than 90\%.

Motivation: 单目和立体深度估计各有优缺点，但实践中两者通常独立使用。OmniDepth旨在通过结合两者的优势，解决各自的局限性。

Method: OmniDepth采用跨注意力对齐机制，动态同步单目上下文线索与立体假设表示，在立体推理中解决模糊性问题。

Result: 实验表明，OmniDepth在Middlebury和ETH3D数据集上的零样本泛化误差减少超过40%，并解决了透明和反射表面的长期问题。

Conclusion: OmniDepth通过融合多视角几何与单目上下文，实现了超越单一模态限制的鲁棒3D感知。

Abstract: Monocular and stereo depth estimation offer complementary strengths:
monocular methods capture rich contextual priors but lack geometric precision,
while stereo approaches leverage epipolar geometry yet struggle with
ambiguities such as reflective or textureless surfaces. Despite post-hoc
synergies, these paradigms remain largely disjoint in practice. We introduce
OmniDepth, a unified framework that bridges both through iterative
bidirectional alignment of their latent representations. At its core, a novel
cross-attentive alignment mechanism dynamically synchronizes monocular
contextual cues with stereo hypothesis representations during stereo reasoning.
This mutual alignment resolves stereo ambiguities (e.g., specular surfaces) by
injecting monocular structure priors while refining monocular depth with stereo
geometry within a single network. Extensive experiments demonstrate
state-of-the-art results: \textbf{OmniDepth reduces zero-shot generalization
error by $\!>\!40\%$ on Middlebury and ETH3D}, while addressing longstanding
failures on transparent and reflective surfaces. By harmonizing multi-view
geometry with monocular context, OmniDepth enables robust 3D perception that
transcends modality-specific limitations. Codes available at

Conclusion: 双耳对称性信息对CNN耳识别系统性能有重要影响，建议在训练和测试中分别处理左右耳。

Abstract: Ear recognition has gained attention as a reliable biometric technique due to
the distinctive characteristics of human ears. With the increasing availability
of large-scale datasets, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely
adopted to learn features directly from raw ear images, outperforming
traditional hand-crafted methods. However, the effect of bilateral ear symmetry
on the features learned by CNNs has received little attention in recent
studies. In this paper, we investigate how bilateral ear symmetry influences
the effectiveness of CNN-based ear recognition. To this end, we first develop
an ear side classifier to automatically categorize ear images as either left or
right. We then explore the impact of incorporating this side information during
both training and test. Cross-dataset evaluations are conducted on five
datasets. Our results suggest that treating left and right ears separately
during training and testing can lead to notable performance improvements.
Furthermore, our ablation studies on alignment strategies, input sizes, and
various hyperparameter settings provide practical insights into training
CNN-based ear recognition systems on large-scale datasets to achieve higher
verification rates.

Motivation: 现有基准在金融领域的多模态推理能力评估上存在不足，FinMMR填补了这一空白。

Method: 通过转化现有金融推理基准和构建新问题，FinMMR整合了多模态数据和复杂金融知识。

Result: 最佳模型在困难问题上仅达到53.0%准确率，表明任务具有挑战性。

Conclusion: FinMMR将推动多模态大语言模型在现实场景中的推理能力提升。

Abstract: We present FinMMR, a novel bilingual multimodal benchmark tailored to
evaluate the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
in financial numerical reasoning tasks. Compared to existing benchmarks, our
work introduces three significant advancements. (1) Multimodality: We
meticulously transform existing financial reasoning benchmarks, and construct
novel questions from the latest Chinese financial research reports. FinMMR
comprises 4.3K questions and 8.7K images spanning 14 categories, including
tables, bar charts, and ownership structure charts. (2) Comprehensiveness:
FinMMR encompasses 14 financial subdomains, including corporate finance,
banking, and industry analysis, significantly exceeding existing benchmarks in
financial domain knowledge breadth. (3) Challenge: Models are required to
perform multi-step precise numerical reasoning by integrating financial
knowledge with the understanding of complex financial images and text. The
best-performing MLLM achieves only 53.0% accuracy on Hard problems. We believe
that FinMMR will drive advancements in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of
MLLMs in real-world scenarios.

### [189] [EncQA: Benchmarking Vision-Language Models on Visual Encodings for Charts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04650)
*Kushin Mukherjee,Donghao Ren,Dominik Moritz,Yannick Assogba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文介绍了一个名为EncQA的新基准测试，用于评估多模态视觉语言模型在图表理解中的视觉推理能力，发现模型性能在不同任务和视觉编码中存在显著差异，且模型规模并不总能提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态视觉语言模型在图表理解基准测试中的进步未能全面覆盖视觉推理能力的需求，因此需要更系统的评估方法。

Method: 提出了EncQA基准测试，包含2,076个合成问题-答案对，覆盖六种视觉编码和八种任务，用于评估9种最先进的模型。

Result: 模型性能在不同任务和视觉编码中差异显著，且模型规模对许多任务-编码对的性能提升有限。

Conclusion: 提升图表理解需要针对特定视觉推理差距的策略，而非单纯扩大模型或数据集规模。

Abstract: Multimodal vision-language models (VLMs) continue to achieve ever-improving
scores on chart understanding benchmarks. Yet, we find that this progress does
not fully capture the breadth of visual reasoning capabilities essential for
interpreting charts. We introduce EncQA, a novel benchmark informed by the
visualization literature, designed to provide systematic coverage of visual
encodings and analytic tasks that are crucial for chart understanding. EncQA
provides 2,076 synthetic question-answer pairs, enabling balanced coverage of
six visual encoding channels (position, length, area, color quantitative, color
nominal, and shape) and eight tasks (find extrema, retrieve value, find
anomaly, filter values, compute derived value exact, compute derived value
relative, correlate values, and correlate values relative). Our evaluation of 9
state-of-the-art VLMs reveals that performance varies significantly across
encodings within the same task, as well as across tasks. Contrary to
expectations, we observe that performance does not improve with model size for
many task-encoding pairs. Our results suggest that advancing chart
understanding requires targeted strategies addressing specific visual reasoning
gaps, rather than solely scaling up model or dataset size.

### [190] [X-SAM: From Segment Anything to Any Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04655)
*Hao Wang,Limeng Qiao,Zequn Jie,Zhijian Huang,Chengjian Feng,Qingfang Zheng,Lin Ma,Xiangyuan Lan,Xiaodan Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-SAM是一个多模态大语言模型框架，扩展了图像分割能力，从“分割任何事物”到“任何分割”，并引入了新的视觉接地分割任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有模型（如SAM）在多掩码预测和类别特定分割任务中的局限性，以及无法统一所有分割任务的问题。

Method: 提出统一框架，支持多数据集联合训练，并引入视觉接地分割任务。

Result: X-SAM在多个图像分割基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: X-SAM为多模态、像素级视觉理解提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in broad
knowledge representation, yet they are inherently deficient in pixel-level
perceptual understanding. Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) represents
a significant advancement in visual-prompt-driven image segmentation, it
exhibits notable limitations in multi-mask prediction and category-specific
segmentation tasks, and it cannot integrate all segmentation tasks within a
unified model architecture. To address these limitations, we present X-SAM, a
streamlined Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) framework that extends the
segmentation paradigm from \textit{segment anything} to \textit{any
segmentation}. Specifically, we introduce a novel unified framework that
enables more advanced pixel-level perceptual comprehension for MLLMs.
Furthermore, we propose a new segmentation task, termed Visual GrounDed (VGD)
segmentation, which segments all instance objects with interactive visual
prompts and empowers MLLMs with visual grounded, pixel-wise interpretative
capabilities. To enable effective training on diverse data sources, we present
a unified training strategy that supports co-training across multiple datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate that X-SAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance on a wide range of image segmentation benchmarks, highlighting its
efficiency for multimodal, pixel-level visual understanding. Code is available

Conclusion: 该技术可早期发现感染，减少人工检查需求，提升大规模农场生物安全。

Abstract: In the poultry industry, detecting chicken illnesses is essential to avoid
financial losses. Conventional techniques depend on manual observation, which
is laborious and prone to mistakes. Using YOLO v8 a deep learning model for
real-time object recognition. This study suggests an AI based approach, by
developing a system that analyzes high resolution chicken photos, YOLO v8
detects signs of illness, such as abnormalities in behavior and appearance. A
sizable, annotated dataset has been used to train the algorithm, which provides
accurate real-time identification of infected chicken and prompt warnings to
farm operators for prompt action. By facilitating early infection
identification, eliminating the need for human inspection, and enhancing
biosecurity in large-scale farms, this AI technology improves chicken health
management. The real-time features of YOLO v8 provide a scalable and effective
method for improving farm management techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixCuboid是一种基于多视图对齐的优化方法，用于估计立方体形状的房间布局，显著优于现有方法，并支持扩展到多房间场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 粗粒度房间布局估计为下游任务提供重要几何线索，但现有方法多基于单视图且假设全景图像，限制了其应用。

Method: 通过端到端训练优化密集深度特征的多视图对齐，学习具有大收敛域和平滑损失景观的特征图，从而简化布局初始化。

Result: 在ScanNet++和2D-3D-Semantics基准测试中显著优于现有方法，并支持多房间布局估计。

Conclusion: PixCuboid通过优化方法实现了高效且灵活的房间布局估计，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: Coarse room layout estimation provides important geometric cues for many
downstream tasks. Current state-of-the-art methods are predominantly based on
single views and often assume panoramic images. We introduce PixCuboid, an
optimization-based approach for cuboid-shaped room layout estimation, which is
based on multi-view alignment of dense deep features. By training with the
optimization end-to-end, we learn feature maps that yield large convergence
basins and smooth loss landscapes in the alignment. This allows us to
initialize the room layout using simple heuristics.
  For the evaluation we propose two new benchmarks based on ScanNet++ and
2D-3D-Semantics, with manually verified ground truth 3D cuboids. In thorough
experiments we validate our approach and significantly outperform the
competition. Finally, while our network is trained with single cuboids, the
flexibility of the optimization-based approach allow us to easily extend to
multi-room estimation, e.g. larger apartments or offices. Code and model
weights are available at https://github.com/ghanning/PixCuboid.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HierarchicalPrune是一种新型压缩框架，通过分层修剪、位置权重保护和敏感度引导蒸馏技术，显著减少扩散模型的参数规模和延迟，同时保持输出质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模文本到图像扩散模型在资源受限设备上推理的挑战。

Method: 结合分层位置修剪、位置权重保护和敏感度引导蒸馏三种技术。

Result: 内存占用减少77.5-80.4%，延迟降低27.9-38.0%，输出质量接近原始模型。

Conclusion: HierarchicalPrune有效平衡了模型压缩与输出质量，适用于设备端推理。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) achieve remarkable
quality, yet their massive parameter scale (8-11B) poses significant challenges
for inferences on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present
HierarchicalPrune, a novel compression framework grounded in a key observation:
DM blocks exhibit distinct functional hierarchies, where early blocks establish
semantic structures while later blocks handle texture refinements.
HierarchicalPrune synergistically combines three techniques: (1) Hierarchical
Position Pruning, which identifies and removes less essential later blocks
based on position hierarchy; (2) Positional Weight Preservation, which
systematically protects early model portions that are essential for semantic
structural integrity; and (3) Sensitivity-Guided Distillation, which adjusts
knowledge-transfer intensity based on our discovery of block-wise sensitivity
variations. As a result, our framework brings billion-scale diffusion models
into a range more suitable for on-device inference, while preserving the
quality of the output images. Specifically, when combined with INT4 weight
quantisation, HierarchicalPrune achieves 77.5-80.4% memory footprint reduction
(e.g., from 15.8 GB to 3.2 GB) and 27.9-38.0% latency reduction, measured on
server and consumer grade GPUs, with the minimum drop of 2.6% in GenEval score
and 7% in HPSv2 score compared to the original model. Last but not least, our
comprehensive user study with 85 participants demonstrates that
HierarchicalPrune maintains perceptual quality comparable to the original model
while significantly outperforming prior works.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ANPrompt是一种新的提示调优框架，旨在增强视觉语言模型在弱语义扰动下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了提示调优模型对弱语义扰动的脆弱性，影响了其泛化能力。

Method: ANPrompt通过融合原始和噪声扰动的文本特征构建噪声提示，并结合可学习提示令牌生成抗噪声提示，同时引入噪声感知视觉语义和多种损失目标。

Result: 在11个基准测试中，ANPrompt表现优于现有方法，具有更强的抗噪声能力和泛化能力。

Conclusion: ANPrompt显著提升了视觉语言模型在弱语义扰动下的鲁棒性和泛化性能。

Abstract: Prompt tuning has emerged as an efficient and effective technique for
adapting vision-language models (VLMs) with low computational overhead.
However, existing methods often overlook the vulnerability of prompt-tuned VLMs
to weak semantic perturbations-such as subtle image or text noise-that degrade
their generalization to unseen classes. To address this limitation, we propose
ANPrompt, a novel prompt tuning framework designed to enhance robustness under
such perturbations. ANPrompt first constructs weak noise text features by
fusing original and noise-perturbed text embeddings, which are then clustered
to form noise prompts. These noise prompts are integrated with learnable prompt
tokens to generate anti-noise prompts, which are injected into the deeper
layers of both image and text encoders. To further capture the noise-aware
visual semantics, ANPrompt computes the Noise-Resistant Visual Prompt Prototype
(NRVPP) by averaging the output prompt tokens from the vision encoder. Finally,
ANPrompt introduces alignment, robustness, and anti-noise objectives by
computing a Weak semantic noise Alignment Loss (WALoss) alongside the standard
cross-entropy and sim loss. Experiments across 11 benchmarks demonstrate that
ANPrompt consistently outperforms existing prompt tuning approaches, achieving
superior robustness to semantic noise and improved generalization to novel
categories.

Motivation: 现有数据集缺乏通用交互知识和第一人称视角，限制了AI助手在真实世界中的表现。

Method: 采用视觉-语言-动作框架，结合RGB-MoCap系统，生成多模态交互数据。

Result: 构建了包含11.4小时、1.2M帧数据的InterVLA数据集，并设立了新基准任务。

Conclusion: InterVLA数据集和基准任务将推动物理世界中AI代理的研究。

Abstract: Learning action models from real-world human-centric interaction datasets is
important towards building general-purpose intelligent assistants with
efficiency. However, most existing datasets only offer specialist interaction
category and ignore that AI assistants perceive and act based on first-person
acquisition. We urge that both the generalist interaction knowledge and
egocentric modality are indispensable. In this paper, we embed the
manual-assisted task into a vision-language-action framework, where the
assistant provides services to the instructor following egocentric vision and
commands. With our hybrid RGB-MoCap system, pairs of assistants and instructors
engage with multiple objects and the scene following GPT-generated scripts.
Under this setting, we accomplish InterVLA, the first large-scale
human-object-human interaction dataset with 11.4 hours and 1.2M frames of
multimodal data, spanning 2 egocentric and 5 exocentric videos, accurate
human/object motions and verbal commands. Furthermore, we establish novel
benchmarks on egocentric human motion estimation, interaction synthesis, and
interaction prediction with comprehensive analysis. We believe that our
InterVLA testbed and the benchmarks will foster future works on building AI
agents in the physical world.

Result: 在V2XPnP-Seq数据集上验证，TurboTrain提升了多智能体感知和预测模型的性能。

Conclusion: 预训练有效捕捉时空特征，平衡多任务学习策略提升检测和预测性能。

Abstract: End-to-end training of multi-agent systems offers significant advantages in
improving multi-task performance. However, training such models remains
challenging and requires extensive manual design and monitoring. In this work,
we introduce TurboTrain, a novel and efficient training framework for
multi-agent perception and prediction. TurboTrain comprises two key components:
a multi-agent spatiotemporal pretraining scheme based on masked reconstruction
learning and a balanced multi-task learning strategy based on gradient conflict
suppression. By streamlining the training process, our framework eliminates the
need for manually designing and tuning complex multi-stage training pipelines,
substantially reducing training time and improving performance. We evaluate
TurboTrain on a real-world cooperative driving dataset, V2XPnP-Seq, and
demonstrate that it further improves the performance of state-of-the-art
multi-agent perception and prediction models. Our results highlight that
pretraining effectively captures spatiotemporal multi-agent features and
significantly benefits downstream tasks. Moreover, the proposed balanced
multi-task learning strategy enhances detection and prediction.

TL;DR: BEVCon是一个对比学习框架，旨在提升自动驾驶中的鸟瞰图（BEV）感知能力，通过两个对比学习模块优化特征表示，实验显示性能显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BEV感知在自动驾驶中至关重要，但现有研究主要集中在编码器和任务特定头上，忽视了表示学习的潜力。

Method: BEVCon提出两个对比学习模块：实例特征对比模块和视角对比模块，结合检测损失进行密集对比学习。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，BEVCon实现了最高2.4%的mAP提升，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 表示学习在BEV感知中起关键作用，为传统任务特定优化提供了补充途径。

Abstract: We present BEVCon, a simple yet effective contrastive learning framework
designed to improve Bird's Eye View (BEV) perception in autonomous driving. BEV
perception offers a top-down-view representation of the surrounding
environment, making it crucial for 3D object detection, segmentation, and
trajectory prediction tasks. While prior work has primarily focused on
enhancing BEV encoders and task-specific heads, we address the underexplored
potential of representation learning in BEV models. BEVCon introduces two
contrastive learning modules: an instance feature contrast module for refining
BEV features and a perspective view contrast module that enhances the image
backbone. The dense contrastive learning designed on top of detection losses
leads to improved feature representations across both the BEV encoder and the
backbone. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that BEVCon
achieves consistent performance gains, achieving up to +2.4% mAP improvement
over state-of-the-art baselines. Our results highlight the critical role of
representation learning in BEV perception and offer a complementary avenue to
conventional task-specific optimizations.

TL;DR: ST-Occ是一个用于3D占用预测的时空一致性学习框架，通过历史信息的高效存储和不确定性动态感知，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多帧输入下3D占用预测的高处理成本和时空不一致性问题。

Method: 提出ST-Occ框架，包含时空记忆模块和记忆注意力机制，高效捕获历史信息并动态感知不确定性。

Result: 实验显示，ST-Occ在3D占用预测任务中优于现有方法3 mIoU，并减少29%的时空不一致性。

Conclusion: ST-Occ通过时空特征学习有效提升了3D占用预测的性能和一致性。

Abstract: 3D occupancy becomes a promising perception representation for autonomous
driving to model the surrounding environment at a fine-grained scale. However,
it remains challenging to efficiently aggregate 3D occupancy over time across
multiple input frames due to the high processing cost and the uncertainty and
dynamics of voxels. To address this issue, we propose ST-Occ, a scene-level
occupancy representation learning framework that effectively learns the
spatiotemporal feature with temporal consistency. ST-Occ consists of two core
designs: a spatiotemporal memory that captures comprehensive historical
information and stores it efficiently through a scene-level representation and
a memory attention that conditions the current occupancy representation on the
spatiotemporal memory with a model of uncertainty and dynamic awareness. Our
method significantly enhances the spatiotemporal representation learned for 3D
occupancy prediction tasks by exploiting the temporal dependency between
multi-frame inputs. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 3 mIoU and reduces the temporal
inconsistency by 29%.
