### [1] [Noise or Nuance: An Investigation Into Useful Information and Filtering For LLM Driven AKBC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08903)
*Alex Clay,Ernesto Jiménez-Ruiz,Pranava Madhyastha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 在受限环境中研究三元组完成任务，发现额外信息提升生成质量，LLM能有效过滤低质量三元组，解析方式需根据环境选择灵活性与一致性的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在类似2025 LM-KBC挑战赛这种不允许使用RAG和精调的受限环境中，需要找到提升LLM输出质量的其他有效方法。

Method: 从三个方面研究三元组完成任务：生成、质量保证和LLM响应解析，在受限条件下进行实验分析。

Result: 额外信息能显著提升生成质量；LLM在过滤低质量三元组方面表现有效；LLM响应解析的灵活性与一致性平衡取决于具体设置。

Conclusion: 即使在无法使用RAG和精调的受限环境中，通过优化生成过程、质量控制和响应解析策略，仍可以提升LLM在三元组完成任务中的表现。

Abstract: RAG and fine-tuning are prevalent strategies for improving the quality of LLM
outputs. However, in constrained situations, such as that of the 2025 LM-KBC
challenge, such techniques are restricted. In this work we investigate three
facets of the triple completion task: generation, quality assurance, and LLM
response parsing. Our work finds that in this constrained setting: additional
information improves generation quality, LLMs can be effective at filtering
poor quality triples, and the tradeoff between flexibility and consistency with
LLM response parsing is setting dependent.

### [2] [Automated Evidence Extraction and Scoring for Corporate Climate Policy Engagement: A Multilingual RAG Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08907)
*Imene Kolli,Ario Saeid Vaghefi,Chiara Colesanti Senni,Shantam Raj,Markus Leippold*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个AI辅助框架，利用检索增强生成技术来自动化从大规模文本数据中提取企业气候政策参与证据，加速企业气候政策参与监测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然InfluenceMap在自动化分析工作流程方面取得进展，但大部分评估仍依赖人工，耗时耗力且易出错，需要更高效的自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用检索增强生成技术，结合布局感知解析、Nomic嵌入模型和少样本提示策略，从多语言企业文档中提取和分类证据。

Result: 评估显示该方法在从多语言企业文档中提取和分类证据方面表现最佳，有效加速证据提取过程。

Conclusion: 虽然自动化RAG系统能有效加速证据提取，但由于分析的复杂性，需要采用人机协同的方式，让技术增强而非替代专家判断以确保准确性。

Abstract: InfluenceMap's LobbyMap Platform monitors the climate policy engagement of
over 500 companies and 250 industry associations, assessing each entity's
support or opposition to science-based policy pathways for achieving the Paris
Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5{\deg}C. Although
InfluenceMap has made progress with automating key elements of the analytical
workflow, a significant portion of the assessment remains manual, making it
time- and labor-intensive and susceptible to human error. We propose an
AI-assisted framework to accelerate the monitoring of corporate climate policy
engagement by leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation to automate the most
time-intensive extraction of relevant evidence from large-scale textual data.
Our evaluation shows that a combination of layout-aware parsing, the Nomic
embedding model, and few-shot prompting strategies yields the best performance
in extracting and classifying evidence from multilingual corporate documents.
We conclude that while the automated RAG system effectively accelerates
evidence extraction, the nuanced nature of the analysis necessitates a
human-in-the-loop approach where the technology augments, rather than replaces,
expert judgment to ensure accuracy.

### [3] [Documents Are People and Words Are Items: A Psychometric Approach to Textual Data with Contextual Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08920)
*Jinsong Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用大语言模型分析文本数据的新心理测量方法，通过上下文嵌入创建上下文分数，将文本数据转换为适合心理测量分析的数据格式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统心理测量方法难以直接应用于文本数据，需要开发新的方法来挖掘文本中的潜在知识维度和模式。

Method: 两阶段建模：第一阶段使用NLP技术和编码器转换模型识别关键词并生成上下文分数；第二阶段使用探索性和双因子模型等因子分析技术提取潜在因子。

Result: 在Wiki STEM语料库上的实验证明该方法能够有效发现文本数据中的潜在知识维度和模式。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅增强了文本数据的心理测量分析能力，在教育、心理学和法律等文本信息丰富的领域具有广阔应用前景。

Abstract: This research introduces a novel psychometric method for analyzing textual
data using large language models. By leveraging contextual embeddings to create
contextual scores, we transform textual data into response data suitable for
psychometric analysis. Treating documents as individuals and words as items,
this approach provides a natural psychometric interpretation under the
assumption that certain keywords, whose contextual meanings vary significantly
across documents, can effectively differentiate documents within a corpus. The
modeling process comprises two stages: obtaining contextual scores and
performing psychometric analysis. In the first stage, we utilize natural
language processing techniques and encoder based transformer models to identify
common keywords and generate contextual scores. In the second stage, we employ
various types of factor analysis, including exploratory and bifactor models, to
extract and define latent factors, determine factor correlations, and identify
the most significant words associated with each factor. Applied to the Wiki
STEM corpus, our experimental results demonstrate the method's potential to
uncover latent knowledge dimensions and patterns within textual data. This
approach not only enhances the psychometric analysis of textual data but also
holds promise for applications in fields rich in textual information, such as
education, psychology, and law.

### [4] [BRoverbs -- Measuring how much LLMs understand Portuguese proverbs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08960)
*Thales Sales Almeida,Giovana Kerche Bonás,João Guilherme Alves Santos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BRoverbs是一个专门针对巴西葡萄牙语的评估数据集，通过巴西谚语来测试大语言模型对区域语言和文化理解的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有葡萄牙语评估主要依赖翻译数据集或局限于结构化考试和社交媒体情感分析，无法充分捕捉语言细微差别和文化参考，需要针对特定区域的成熟评估框架。

Method: 创建BRoverbs数据集，使用巴西谚语作为评估工具，因为谚语包含文化智慧、比喻表达和复杂句法结构，能够有效测试模型对区域表达的理解。

Result: 开发了一个专门针对巴西葡萄牙语的新评估基准，可用于评估葡萄牙语大语言模型的性能，填补了现有评估的空白。

Conclusion: BRoverbs为葡萄牙语大语言模型提供了新的区域化评估工具，有助于推进基于区域信息的基准测试发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant performance variations
depending on the linguistic and cultural context in which they are applied.
This disparity signals the necessity of mature evaluation frameworks that can
assess their capabilities in specific regional settings. In the case of
Portuguese, existing evaluations remain limited, often relying on translated
datasets that may not fully capture linguistic nuances or cultural references.
Meanwhile, native Portuguese-language datasets predominantly focus on
structured national exams or sentiment analysis of social media interactions,
leaving gaps in evaluating broader linguistic understanding. To address this
limitation, we introduce BRoverbs, a dataset specifically designed to assess
LLM performance through Brazilian proverbs. Proverbs serve as a rich linguistic
resource, encapsulating cultural wisdom, figurative expressions, and complex
syntactic structures that challenge the model comprehension of regional
expressions. BRoverbs aims to provide a new evaluation tool for
Portuguese-language LLMs, contributing to advancing regionally informed
benchmarking. The benchmark is available at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/Tropic-AI/BRoverbs.

### [5] [Can Vision-Language Models Solve Visual Math Equations?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09013)
*Monjoy Narayan Choudhury,Junling Wang,Yifan Hou,Mrinmaya Sachan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VLMs在视觉方程求解任务中表现不佳，主要瓶颈在于系数计数和符号推理，揭示了当前模型在多步视觉推理方面的关键弱点


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视觉语言模型在需要整合感知和符号计算的任务中的局限性，特别是视觉方程求解任务

Method: 将视觉方程求解任务分解为系数计数和变量识别两个子任务进行分析，研究不同复杂度方程下的性能表现

Result: VLMs在文本方程上表现良好，但在视觉方程上失败；计数是主要瓶颈；组合识别和推理会引入额外错误；随着方程复杂度增加，符号推理本身成为限制因素

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在视觉基础数学推理方面存在关键弱点，这些发现为未来改进指明了方向

Abstract: Despite strong performance in visual understanding and language-based
reasoning, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with tasks requiring
integrated perception and symbolic computation. We study this limitation
through visual equation solving, where mathematical equations are embedded in
images, variables are represented by object icons, and coefficients must be
inferred by counting. While VLMs perform well on textual equations, they fail
on visually grounded counterparts. To understand this gap, we decompose the
task into coefficient counting and variable recognition, and find that counting
is the primary bottleneck, even when recognition is accurate. We also observe
that composing recognition and reasoning introduces additional errors,
highlighting challenges in multi-step visual reasoning. Finally, as equation
complexity increases, symbolic reasoning itself becomes a limiting factor.
These findings reveal key weaknesses in current VLMs and point toward future
improvements in visually grounded mathematical reasoning.

### [6] [Stated Preference for Interaction and Continued Engagement (SPICE): Evaluating an LLM's Willingness to Re-engage in Conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09043)
*Thomas Manuel Rost,Martina Figlia,Bernd Wallraff*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPICE是一种通过询问LLM是否愿意继续与用户互动的简单诊断信号，能够有效区分不同用户语气下的模型偏好，为模型审计提供直接的关系信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种简单有效的诊断工具来评估大型语言模型对用户互动的持续参与意愿，补充现有的评估指标。

Method: 使用3种用户语气（友好、模糊、辱骂）和10种互动场景的刺激集，测试4个开源聊天模型在4种框架条件下的480次试验，通过YES/NO问题收集模型的再参与意愿。

Result: SPICE能清晰区分用户语气：友好互动97.5%愿意继续，辱骂互动仅17.9%愿意继续，模糊互动为60.4%。即使在模型未能识别辱骂的情况下，81%的试验仍表示不愿继续。

Conclusion: SPICE是一个稳健、低开销且可复现的工具，可用于审计模型倾向，通过提供直接的模型状态关系信号来补充现有指标。

Abstract: We introduce and evaluate Stated Preference for Interaction and Continued
Engagement (SPICE), a simple diagnostic signal elicited by asking a Large
Language Model a YES or NO question about its willingness to re-engage with a
user's behavior after reviewing a short transcript. In a study using a 3-tone
(friendly, unclear, abusive) by 10-interaction stimulus set, we tested four
open-weight chat models across four framing conditions, resulting in 480
trials. Our findings show that SPICE sharply discriminates by user tone.
Friendly interactions yielded a near-unanimous preference to continue (97.5%
YES), while abusive interactions yielded a strong preference to discontinue
(17.9% YES), with unclear interactions falling in between (60.4% YES). This
core association remains decisive under multiple dependence-aware statistical
tests, including Rao-Scott adjustment and cluster permutation tests.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that SPICE provides a distinct signal from abuse
classification. In trials where a model failed to identify abuse, it still
overwhelmingly stated a preference not to continue the interaction (81% of the
time). An exploratory analysis also reveals a significant interaction effect: a
preamble describing the study context significantly impacts SPICE under
ambiguity, but only when transcripts are presented as a single block of text
rather than a multi-turn chat. The results validate SPICE as a robust,
low-overhead, and reproducible tool for auditing model dispositions,
complementing existing metrics by offering a direct, relational signal of a
model's state. All stimuli, code, and analysis scripts are released to support
replication.

### [7] [Improving LLM Safety and Helpfulness using SFT and DPO: A Study on OPT-350M](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09055)
*Piyush Pant*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究比较了SFT、DPO和SFT+DPO组合方法在OPT-350M模型安全性和有用性对齐上的效果，发现SFT+DPO组合方法表现最佳


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索不同对齐技术在提升语言模型安全性和有用性方面的效果，为建立更稳健的模型对齐流程提供基础

Method: 使用Anthropic Helpful-Harmless RLHF数据集，训练和评估四个模型（基础OPT350M、SFT模型、DPO模型、SFT+DPO模型），采用害处率(HmR)、有用率(HpR)和结合对齐分数(CAS)三个评估指标

Result: SFT表现超过DPO，但SFT+DPO组合模型在所有指标上都表现最好，证明了这两种技术的互补性，同时发现噪声数据、GPU资源限制和训练约束等挑战

Conclusion: 组合使用SFT和DPO技术可以最大化模型对齐效果，这为未来建立更稳健的模型对齐流程提供了重要基础

Abstract: This research investigates the effectiveness of alignment techniques,
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and a
combined SFT+DPO approach on improving the safety and helpfulness of the
OPT-350M language model. Utilizing the Anthropic Helpful-Harmless RLHF dataset,
we train and evaluate four models: the base OPT350M, an SFT model, a DPO model,
and a model trained with both SFT and DPO. We introduce three key evaluation
metrics: Harmlessness Rate (HmR), Helpfulness Rate (HpR), and a Combined
Alignment Score (CAS), all derived from reward model outputs. The results show
that while SFT outperforms DPO, The combined SFT+DPO model outperforms all
others across all metrics, demonstrating the complementary nature of these
techniques. Our findings also highlight challenges posed by noisy data, limited
GPU resources, and training constraints. This study offers a comprehensive view
of how fine-tuning strategies affect model alignment and provides a foundation
for more robust alignment pipelines in future work.

### [8] [MR-UIE: Multi-Perspective Reasoning with Reinforcement Learning for Universal Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09082)
*Zhongqiu Li,Shiquan Wang,Ruiyu Fang,Mengjiao Bao,Zhenhe Wu,Shuangyong Song,Yongxiang Li,Zhongjiang He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MR-UIE方法，通过强化学习结合多视角推理来提升大语言模型在通用信息抽取任务中的性能，特别是在复杂模式描述和多步推理场景下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在通用信息抽取任务中表现不足，特别是在处理结构化输出、复杂模式描述和多步推理时存在显著局限性。现有方法通过上下文学习和指令调优提升性能，但仍存在明显不足。

Method: 提出MR-UIE方法，将强化学习与多视角推理相结合，使大语言模型从被动抽取器转变为主动推理器，不仅理解要抽取什么，还理解如何推理。

Result: 在多个信息抽取基准测试中，MR-UIE方法持续提升了跨领域的抽取准确性，并在多个数据集上超越了最先进的方法。多视角推理与强化学习的结合显著增强了复杂信息抽取任务中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 多视角推理在强化学习框架中的整合对于提升大语言模型在复杂信息抽取任务中的性能至关重要，特别是在具有挑战性的场景中，推理发挥着关键作用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate robust capabilities across diverse
research domains. However, their performance in universal information
extraction (UIE) remains insufficient, especially when tackling structured
output scenarios that involve complex schema descriptions and require
multi-step reasoning. While existing approaches enhance the performance of LLMs
through in-context learning and instruction tuning, significant limitations
nonetheless persist. To enhance the model's generalization ability, we propose
integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with multi-perspective reasoning for
information extraction (IE) tasks. Our work transitions LLMs from passive
extractors to active reasoners, enabling them to understand not only what to
extract but also how to reason. Experiments conducted on multiple IE benchmarks
demonstrate that MR-UIE consistently elevates extraction accuracy across
domains and surpasses state-of-the-art methods on several datasets.
Furthermore, incorporating multi-perspective reasoning into RL notably enhances
generalization in complex IE tasks, underscoring the critical role of reasoning
in challenging scenarios.

### [9] [TigerCoder: A Novel Suite of LLMs for Code Generation in Bangla](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09101)
*Nishat Raihan,Antonios Anastasopoulos,Marcos Zampieri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 香加拉语代码生成大语言模型TigerCoder家族，包含1B和9B版本，通过专门数据集和评测标准提升了香加拉语代码生成能力11-18%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 香加拉语作为世界第5大语言在大语言模型中表现不足，特别是在代码生成领域，主要原因是缺乏高质量的训练数据

Method: 构建了香加拉语代码指令数据集和MBPP-Bangla评测标准，开发了TigerCoder家族代码LLM模型（包含1B和9B两个规模）

Result: 模型在Pass@1指标上比现有多语言和通用香加拉语LLM提升11-18%的性能提升

Conclusion: 精心编译的高质量数据集可以克服小型模型在低资源语言中的限制，所有资源已开源以促进香加拉语LLM研究发展

Abstract: Despite being the 5th most spoken language, Bangla remains underrepresented
in Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for code generation. This
primarily stems from the scarcity of high-quality data to pre-train and/or
finetune such models. Hence, we introduce the first dedicated family of Code
LLMs for Bangla (1B & 9B). We offer three major contributions: (1) a
comprehensive Bangla code instruction datasets for programming domain
adaptation; (2) MBPP-Bangla, an evaluation benchmark for Bangla code
generation; and (3) the TigerCoder-family of Code LLMs, achieving significant
~11-18% performance gains at Pass@1 over existing multilingual and
general-purpose Bangla LLMs. Our findings show that curated, high-quality
datasets can overcome limitations of smaller models for low-resource languages.
We open-source all resources to advance further Bangla LLM research.

### [10] [Compass-v3: Scaling Domain-Specific LLMs for Multilingual E-Commerce in Southeast Asia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09121)
*Sophia Maria*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Compass-v3是一个245B参数的垂直领域MoE模型，专门针对东南亚电商场景设计，在电商任务上超越GPT-4等主流模型，支持多语言并已在Shopee平台大规模应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用大语言模型在需要领域专业知识的专门任务上表现不佳，电商领域数据嘈杂、异构、多语言且高度动态，需要专门的解决方案。

Method: 采用更少但更大的专家模型，结合硬件优化（节点内专家并行和定制memcpy操作符），在12T tokens的多语言语料和合成电商指令上训练，并提出OTPO方法增强对齐能力。

Result: 在电商任务上超越DeepSeek-V3.1、GPT-4系列和Qwen3-235B，在东南亚低资源语言和葡萄牙语上表现强劲，同时保持通用基准的竞争力，已在Shopee平台覆盖70%以上LLM流量。

Conclusion: Compass-v3证明了垂直领域MoE模型在电商等专业领域的有效性，兼具专业电商知识和广泛语言能力，具备工业级应用价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in general-domain applications, yet their
performance often degrades in specialized tasks requiring domain-specific
knowledge. E-commerce is particularly challenging, as its data are noisy,
heterogeneous, multilingual, and highly dynamic. We present Compass-v3, a
vertical-domain Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model with 245B total parameters and
71B active per token, designed for Southeast Asian e-commerce. Compass-v3
adopts fewer but larger experts, combined with hardware-efficient
optimizations-such as intra-node expert parallelism and a customized memcpy
operator-to maximize GPU utilization. The model is trained on 12T tokens of
curated multilingual corpora and large-scale synthetic e-commerce instructions
using a mixed-training strategy. To enhance alignment, we propose
Optimal-Transport Direct Preference Optimization (OTPO), which captures
token-level distinctions and improves instruction adherence in
commerce-specific scenarios. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Compass-v3
delivers state-of-the-art e-commerce performance, surpassing DeepSeek-V3.1,
GPT-4 series, and Qwen3-235B. Moreover, Compass-v3 demonstrates strong
multilingual capability across low-resource Southeast Asian languages
(Indonesian, Thai, Filipino, Vietnamese, Malay, Taglog) and Portuguese while
sustaining competitive performance on general benchmarks. It has already been
widely applied in Shopee's industrial-scale e-commerce platform and is
gradually replacing OpenAI's traffic, now accounting for over 70\% of total LLM
usage, highlighting its dual strengths in specialized commerce expertise and
broad linguistic competence.

### [11] [Automated Classification of Tutors' Dialogue Acts Using Generative AI: A Case Study Using the CIMA Corpus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09125)
*Liqun He,Jiaqi Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用GPT-4自动化分类教育对话中教师的话语行为，达到80%准确率，显示了生成式AI在教育对话分析中的强大潜力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少传统手动编码教育对话中教师话语行为分类所需的时间和精力，提高分析效率

Method: 使用CIMA语料库，测试GPT-3.5-turbo和GPT-4模型，通过精心设计的提示进行四类话语行为分类

Result: GPT-4达到了80%准确率、权重F1得0.81、Cohen's Kappa 0.74，超越基准绩效并与人工标注实现实质一致

Conclusion: 生成式AI可以提供高效可访的话语行为分类方案，任务特定标签定义和上下文信息对质量至关重要，同时需要关注伦理问题和负责任研究实践

Abstract: This study explores the use of generative AI for automating the
classification of tutors' Dialogue Acts (DAs), aiming to reduce the time and
effort required by traditional manual coding. This case study uses the
open-source CIMA corpus, in which tutors' responses are pre-annotated into four
DA categories. Both GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 models were tested using tailored
prompts. Results show that GPT-4 achieved 80% accuracy, a weighted F1-score of
0.81, and a Cohen's Kappa of 0.74, surpassing baseline performance and
indicating substantial agreement with human annotations. These findings suggest
that generative AI has strong potential to provide an efficient and accessible
approach to DA classification, with meaningful implications for educational
dialogue analysis. The study also highlights the importance of task-specific
label definitions and contextual information in enhancing the quality of
automated annotation. Finally, it underscores the ethical considerations
associated with the use of generative AI and the need for responsible and
transparent research practices. The script of this research is publicly

### [12] [ViRanker: A BGE-M3 & Blockwise Parallel Transformer Cross-Encoder for Vietnamese Reranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09131)
*Phuong-Nam Dang,Kieu-Linh Nguyen,Thanh-Hieu Pham*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ViRanker是一个专门为越南语设计的交叉编码器重排序模型，基于BGE-M3编码器构建，采用Blockwise Parallel Transformer增强，在MMARCO-VI基准测试中表现优异，超越了多语言基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决越南语作为低资源语言缺乏竞争性重排序模型的问题，越南语具有复杂语法和音调符号，需要专门优化的模型来处理其语言特性。

Method: 基于BGE-M3编码器构建，使用Blockwise Parallel Transformer进行增强，在8GB精选语料库上训练，采用混合硬负采样进行微调以增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在MMARCO-VI基准测试中实现了强大的早期排名准确性，超越了多语言基线模型，与PhoRanker竞争表现接近。

Conclusion: ViRanker填补了越南语重排序模型的空白，通过精心设计的架构适应和数据策展，为其他 underrepresented 语言的reranking研究提供了可借鉴的方法，模型已在Hugging Face开源发布以支持可重现性和实际应用。

Abstract: This paper presents ViRanker, a cross-encoder reranking model tailored to the
Vietnamese language. Built on the BGE-M3 encoder and enhanced with the
Blockwise Parallel Transformer, ViRanker addresses the lack of competitive
rerankers for Vietnamese, a low-resource language with complex syntax and
diacritics. The model was trained on an 8 GB curated corpus and fine-tuned with
hybrid hard-negative sampling to strengthen robustness. Evaluated on the
MMARCO-VI benchmark, ViRanker achieves strong early-rank accuracy, surpassing
multilingual baselines and competing closely with PhoRanker. By releasing the
model openly on Hugging Face, we aim to support reproducibility and encourage
wider adoption in real-world retrieval systems. Beyond Vietnamese, this study
illustrates how careful architectural adaptation and data curation can advance
reranking in other underrepresented languages.

### [13] [LITcoder: A General-Purpose Library for Building and Comparing Encoding Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09152)
*Taha Binhuraib,Ruimin Gao,Anna A. Ivanova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LITcoder是一个用于构建和基准测试神经编码模型的开源库，提供标准化的工具来处理连续刺激与脑数据的对齐、特征转换、映射和模型评估，支持模块化管道设计和多种方法选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低神经编码模型实现的技术门槛，促进跨模型和数据集的系统比较，提高方法严谨性，加速高质量脑活动预测模型的开发。

Method: 采用模块化管道设计，支持多种方法选择（包括脑数据集、脑区域、刺激特征、降采样方法等），内置日志记录、绘图功能，并与实验跟踪平台无缝集成。

Result: 通过在三组故事聆听数据集上拟合多种编码模型，验证了框架的可扩展性和多功能性，并探索了构建连续fMRI数据编码模型的关键方法选择。

Conclusion: LITcoder有效降低了编码模型实现的技术障碍，促进了系统比较和方法严谨性，加速了高质量脑活动预测模型的发展。

Abstract: We introduce LITcoder, an open-source library for building and benchmarking
neural encoding models. Designed as a flexible backend, LITcoder provides
standardized tools for aligning continuous stimuli (e.g., text and speech) with
brain data, transforming stimuli into representational features, mapping those
features onto brain data, and evaluating the predictive performance of the
resulting model on held-out data. The library implements a modular pipeline
covering a wide array of methodological design choices, so researchers can
easily compose, compare, and extend encoding models without reinventing core
infrastructure. Such choices include brain datasets, brain regions, stimulus
feature (both neural-net-based and control, such as word rate), downsampling
approaches, and many others. In addition, the library provides built-in
logging, plotting, and seamless integration with experiment tracking platforms
such as Weights & Biases (W&B). We demonstrate the scalability and versatility
of our framework by fitting a range of encoding models to three story listening
datasets: LeBel et al. (2023), Narratives, and Little Prince. We also explore
the methodological choices critical for building encoding models for continuous
fMRI data, illustrating the importance of accounting for all tokens in a TR
scan (as opposed to just taking the last one, even when contextualized),
incorporating hemodynamic lag effects, using train-test splits that minimize
information leakage, and accounting for head motion effects on encoding model
predictivity. Overall, LITcoder lowers technical barriers to encoding model
implementation, facilitates systematic comparisons across models and datasets,
fosters methodological rigor, and accelerates the development of high-quality
high-performance predictive models of brain activity.

### [14] [Target-oriented Multimodal Sentiment Classification with Counterfactual-enhanced Debiasing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09160)
*Zhiyue Liu,Fanrong Ma,Xin Ling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的反事实增强去偏框架，通过反事实数据增强和自适应去偏对比学习机制，减少目标导向多模态情感分类中的虚假相关性，提升分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过度依赖文本内容且忽视数据集偏差（特别是词级上下文偏差），导致文本特征与输出标签之间的虚假相关性，影响分类精度。

Method: 采用反事实数据增强策略最小化改变情感相关因果特征，生成细节匹配的图像-文本样本；引入自适应去偏对比学习机制，从反事实数据中学习鲁棒特征并引导模型决策。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法优于现有的最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的反事实增强去偏框架能有效减少虚假相关性，提高目标导向多模态情感分类的性能。

Abstract: Target-oriented multimodal sentiment classification seeks to predict
sentiment polarity for specific targets from image-text pairs. While existing
works achieve competitive performance, they often over-rely on textual content
and fail to consider dataset biases, in particular word-level contextual
biases. This leads to spurious correlations between text features and output
labels, impairing classification accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a novel
counterfactual-enhanced debiasing framework to reduce such spurious
correlations. Our framework incorporates a counterfactual data augmentation
strategy that minimally alters sentiment-related causal features, generating
detail-matched image-text samples to guide the model's attention toward content
tied to sentiment. Furthermore, for learning robust features from
counterfactual data and prompting model decisions, we introduce an adaptive
debiasing contrastive learning mechanism, which effectively mitigates the
influence of biased words. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets
show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EchoX是一个语音到语音大语言模型，通过整合声学和语义学习来解决现有SLLM在知识和推理能力上的退化问题，在少量训练数据下实现先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音大语言模型从文本LLM衍生而来，但在特征表示空间中未能弥合声学-语义鸿沟，导致知识和推理能力退化

Method: 提出EchoX方法，利用语义表示并动态生成语音训练目标，整合声学和语义学习

Result: 仅用约6000小时训练数据，在多个基于知识的问答基准测试中达到先进性能

Conclusion: EchoX通过同时整合声学和语义学习，成功保持了语音LLM的强大推理能力

Abstract: Speech-to-speech large language models (SLLMs) are attracting increasing
attention. Derived from text-based large language models (LLMs), SLLMs often
exhibit degradation in knowledge and reasoning capabilities. We hypothesize
that this limitation arises because current training paradigms for SLLMs fail
to bridge the acoustic-semantic gap in the feature representation space. To
address this issue, we propose EchoX, which leverages semantic representations
and dynamically generates speech training targets. This approach integrates
both acoustic and semantic learning, enabling EchoX to preserve strong
reasoning abilities as a speech LLM. Experimental results demonstrate that
EchoX, with about six thousand hours of training data, achieves advanced
performance on multiple knowledge-based question-answering benchmarks. The
project is available at https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/EchoX.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Trie偏置方法在识别稀有词时需要计算粗糕的分数撤销步骤，这在大解码器模型中计算成本高役

Method: 适配ASR模型进行多步预测，通过细粒度估计部分假设是否会导致完整稀有词的生成，仅使用10小时合成数据对Whisper模型进行微调

Result: 在NSC Part 2测试集上将词误率从30.86%降低到12.19%

Conclusion: 多步预测方法能够有效避免分数撤销的计算开销，显著提升了ASR模型在稀有词识别任务上的性能

Abstract: Contextual biasing improves rare word recognition of ASR models by
prioritizing the output of rare words during decoding. A common approach is
Trie-based biasing, which gives "bonus scores" to partial hypothesis (e.g.
"Bon") that may lead to the generation of the rare word (e.g. "Bonham"). If the
full word ("Bonham") isn't ultimately recognized, the system revokes those
earlier bonuses. This revocation is limited to beam search and is
computationally expensive, particularly for models with large decoders. To
overcome these limitations, we propose adapting ASR models to look ahead and
predict multiple steps at once. This avoids the revocation step entirely by
better estimating whether a partial hypothesis will lead to the generation of
the full rare word. By fine-tuning Whisper with only 10 hours of synthetic
data, our method reduces the word error rate on the NSC Part 2 test set from
30.86% to 12.19%.

Result: 在NSC Part 2测试集上，将Whisper模型的词误率从29.71%显著降低至11.81%

Conclusion: 关键词感知损失函数能够有效提升上下文偏置方法在稀有词识别中的性能，避免了合成数据训练导致的过拟合问题

Abstract: Rare word recognition can be improved by adapting ASR models to synthetic
data that includes these words. Further improvements can be achieved through
contextual biasing, which trains and adds a biasing module into the model
architecture to prioritize rare words. While training the module on synthetic
rare word data is more effective than using non-rare-word data, it can lead to
overfitting due to artifacts in the synthetic audio. To address this, we
enhance the TCPGen-based contextual biasing approach and propose a
keyword-aware loss function that additionally focuses on biased words when
training biasing modules. This loss includes a masked cross-entropy term for
biased word prediction and a binary classification term for detecting biased
word positions. These two terms complementarily support the decoding of biased
words during inference. By adapting Whisper to 10 hours of synthetic data, our
method reduced the word error rate on the NSC Part 2 test set from 29.71% to
11.81%.

Motivation: 狨猴表现出复杂的发声交流能力，具有类似人类语音的特征（如发声标记和轮流对话），研究其发声交流为连接大脑活动提供了独特机会，但由于主要依赖发声交流，标准LLM方法难以直接应用。

Method: 开发了生成式狨猴语音语言模型（GmSLM）管道，使用无监督野外数据和弱标记对话数据设计新颖的零样本评估指标，并与基于人类语音的基线进行比较。

Result: GmSLM生成的发声在声学上与真实重合成样本高度匹配，在下游任务中表现良好，能够有效区分真实与人工对话，尽管完全无监督。

Conclusion: GmSLM为研究发声交流的神经基础提供了实用框架，有望在神经科学、生物声学和进化生物学领域发挥重要作用。

Abstract: Marmoset monkeys exhibit complex vocal communication, challenging the view
that nonhuman primates vocal communication is entirely innate, and show similar
features of human speech, such as vocal labeling of others and turn-taking.
Studying their vocal communication offers a unique opportunity to link it with
brain activity-especially given the difficulty of accessing the human brain in
speech and language research. Since Marmosets communicate primarily through
vocalizations, applying standard LLM approaches is not straightforward. We
introduce Generative Marmoset Spoken Language Modeling (GmSLM), an optimized
spoken language model pipeline for Marmoset vocal communication. We designed a
novel zero-shot evaluation metrics using unsupervised in-the-wild data,
alongside weakly labeled conversational data, to assess GmSLM and demonstrate
its advantage over a basic human-speech-based baseline. GmSLM generated
vocalizations closely matched real resynthesized samples acoustically and
performed well on downstream tasks. Despite being fully unsupervised, GmSLM
effectively distinguish real from artificial conversations and may support
further investigations of the neural basis of vocal communication and provides
a practical framework linking vocalization and brain activity. We believe GmSLM
stands to benefit future work in neuroscience, bioacoustics, and evolutionary
biology. Samples are provided under: pages.cs.huji.ac.il/adiyoss-lab/GmSLM.

Abstract: Scaling language models to longer contexts is essential for capturing rich
dependencies across extended discourse. However, na\"ive context extension
imposes significant computational and memory burdens, often resulting in
inefficiencies during both training and inference. In this work, we propose
CCF, a novel context compression framework designed to enable efficient
long-context modeling by learning hierarchical latent representations that
preserve global semantics while aggressively reducing input redundancy. CCF
integrates segment-wise semantic aggregation with key-value memory encoding,
forming compact representations that support accurate reconstruction and
long-range understanding. To further enhance scalability, we introduce a
training-efficient optimization strategy that couples incremental segment
decoding with sparse reservoir sampling, substantially reducing memory overhead
without degrading performance. Empirical results on multiple long-context
language modeling benchmarks demonstrate that CCF achieves competitive
perplexity under high compression ratios, and significantly improves throughput
and memory efficiency compared to existing approaches. These findings highlight
the potential of structured compression for scalable and effective long-context
language modeling.

Abstract: Accurately assessing candidate seniority from resumes is a critical yet
challenging task, complicated by the prevalence of overstated experience and
ambiguous self-presentation. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of
large language models (LLMs), including fine-tuned BERT architectures, for
automating seniority classification in resumes. To rigorously evaluate model
performance, we introduce a hybrid dataset comprising both real-world resumes
and synthetically generated hard examples designed to simulate exaggerated
qualifications and understated seniority. Using the dataset, we evaluate the
performance of Large Language Models in detecting subtle linguistic cues
associated with seniority inflation and implicit expertise. Our findings

Abstract: Question Answering over Tabular Data (Table QA) presents unique challenges
due to the diverse structure, size, and data types of real-world tables. The
SemEval 2025 Task 8 (DataBench) introduced a benchmark composed of large-scale,

effectiveness of our approach, achieving 70.5\% accuracy on DataBench QA and
71.6\% on DataBench Lite QA, significantly surpassing baseline scores of 26\%

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于弱监督的专利-SDG分类方法，利用专利与SDG相关科学文献的引用关系作为噪声信号，结合大语言模型提取结构化概念，通过复合标注函数生成高质量的软多标签数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的专利-SDG分类方法（如关键词搜索、迁移学习和基于引用的启发式方法）缺乏可扩展性和泛化能力，且缺乏大规模标注数据集限制了监督学习的应用。

Method: 将专利-SDG分类构建为弱监督问题，使用专利到SDG标记科学文献的引用作为噪声初始信号。开发复合标注函数，利用大语言模型从专利和SDG论文中提取结构化概念（功能、解决方案、应用），基于专利本体计算跨域相似度得分，并通过基于排名的检索方法组合结果。

Result: 方法在内部验证中优于多个基线（包括基于Transformer的模型和零样本LLM），在外部验证中通过专利引用、共同发明人和共同申请人网络的模块化分析显示，生成的标签比传统技术分类具有更好的主题、认知和组织一致性。

Conclusion: 弱监督和语义对齐可以显著提升SDG分类的规模化能力，为跟踪创新如何应对全球挑战提供了有效的技术解决方案。

Abstract: Classifying patents by their relevance to the UN Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) is crucial for tracking how innovation addresses global
challenges. However, the absence of a large, labeled dataset limits the use of
supervised learning. Existing methods, such as keyword searches, transfer
learning, and citation-based heuristics, lack scalability and generalizability.
This paper frames patent-to-SDG classification as a weak supervision problem,
using citations from patents to SDG-tagged scientific publications (NPL
citations) as a noisy initial signal. To address its sparsity and noise, we
develop a composite labeling function (LF) that uses large language models
(LLMs) to extract structured concepts, namely functions, solutions, and
applications, from patents and SDG papers based on a patent ontology.
Cross-domain similarity scores are computed and combined using a rank-based
retrieval approach. The LF is calibrated via a custom positive-only loss that
aligns with known NPL-SDG links without penalizing discovery of new SDG
associations. The result is a silver-standard, soft multi-label dataset mapping
patents to SDGs, enabling the training of effective multi-label regression
models. We validate our approach through two complementary strategies: (1)
internal validation against held-out NPL-based labels, where our method
outperforms several baselines including transformer-based models, and zero-shot
LLM; and (2) external validation using network modularity in patent citation,
co-inventor, and co-applicant graphs, where our labels reveal greater thematic,
cognitive, and organizational coherence than traditional technological
classifications. These results show that weak supervision and semantic
alignment can enhance SDG classification at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有幻觉检测方法主要针对独立LLM，无法解决RAG系统中响应必须与检索证据一致的特殊挑战，企业应用中需要可靠的幻觉检测方案

Method: 四阶段框架：1)分解答案为原子事实 2)使用同义词和反义词生成受控变异 3)根据检索上下文验证变体 4)聚合不一致性惩罚为幻觉分数

Conclusion: MetaRAG为RAG系统提供了实时、无监督的幻觉检测方案，特别适用于身份敏感查询的高风险领域，支持细粒度的身份感知安全保障

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in enterprise
applications, yet their reliability remains limited by hallucinations, i.e.,
confident but factually incorrect information. Existing detection approaches,
such as SelfCheckGPT and MetaQA, primarily target standalone LLMs and do not
address the unique challenges of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems,
where responses must be consistent with retrieved evidence. We therefore
present MetaRAG, a metamorphic testing framework for hallucination detection in
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. MetaRAG operates in a real-time,
unsupervised, black-box setting, requiring neither ground-truth references nor
access to model internals, making it suitable for proprietary and high-stakes
domains. The framework proceeds in four stages: (1) decompose answers into
atomic factoids, (2) generate controlled mutations of each factoid using
synonym and antonym substitutions, (3) verify each variant against the
retrieved context (synonyms are expected to be entailed and antonyms
contradicted), and (4) aggregate penalties for inconsistencies into a
response-level hallucination score. Crucially for identity-aware AI, MetaRAG
localizes unsupported claims at the factoid span where they occur (e.g.,
pregnancy-specific precautions, LGBTQ+ refugee rights, or labor eligibility),
allowing users to see flagged spans and enabling system designers to configure
thresholds and guardrails for identity-sensitive queries. Experiments on a
proprietary enterprise dataset illustrate the effectiveness of MetaRAG for
detecting hallucinations and enabling trustworthy deployment of RAG-based
conversational agents. We also outline a topic-based deployment design that
translates MetaRAG's span-level scores into identity-aware safeguards; this
design is discussed but not evaluated in our experiments.

Motivation: 类比推理是人类认知的核心能力，但NLP领域很少从认知科学视角研究这一过程，需要建立认知理论与NLP实践的联系

Method: 总结认知科学文献中类比推理的关键理论，分析这些理论与NLP概念的对应关系，并探讨其在NLP主要挑战中的应用

Result: 发现认知科学中的类比推理过程可以很好地映射到NLP概念，这些见解对NLP中关系理解等关键挑战具有重要指导意义

Conclusion: 通过认知科学视角研究类比推理，可以指导NLP研究者更好地优化文本中的关系理解，减少对实体层面相似性的过度依赖

Abstract: Analogical reasoning is an essential aspect of human cognition. In this
paper, we summarize key theory about the processes underlying analogical
reasoning from the cognitive science literature and relate it to current
research in natural language processing. While these processes can be easily
linked to concepts in NLP, they are generally not viewed through a cognitive
lens. Furthermore, we show how these notions are relevant for several major
challenges in NLP research, not directly related to analogy solving. This may
guide researchers to better optimize relational understanding in text, as
opposed to relying heavily on entity-level similarity.

sequences, enabling linear-time parsing with $n$ tagging actions, and still
representing reentrancies, cycles, and empty nodes. Compared to existing graph
linearizations, this representation substantially reduces the label space while
preserving structural information. We evaluate it on a multilingual and

improvements over other methods in exact match accuracy.

Conclusion: GrACE为LLM部署提供了可扩展、可靠且实时的置信度估计实用解决方案，不仅能提高最终决策准确性，还能显著减少测试时缩放所需的样本数量

Abstract: Assessing the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by confidence
elicitation is a prominent approach to AI safety in high-stakes applications,
such as healthcare and finance. Existing methods either require expensive
computational overhead or suffer from poor calibration, making them impractical
and unreliable for real-world deployment. In this work, we propose GrACE, a
Generative Approach to Confidence Elicitation that enables scalable and
reliable confidence elicitation for LLMs. GrACE adopts a novel mechanism in
which the model expresses confidence by the similarity between the last hidden
state and the embedding of a special token appended to the vocabulary, in
real-time. We fine-tune the model for calibrating the confidence with
calibration targets associated with accuracy. Experiments with three LLMs and
two benchmark datasets show that the confidence produced by GrACE achieves the
best discriminative capacity and calibration on open-ended generation tasks,
outperforming six competing methods without resorting to additional sampling or
an auxiliary model. Moreover, we propose two strategies for improving test-time
scaling based on confidence induced by GrACE. Experimental results show that
using GrACE not only improves the accuracy of the final decision but also
significantly reduces the number of required samples in the test-time scaling
scheme, indicating the potential of GrACE as a practical solution for deploying
LLMs with scalable, reliable, and real-time confidence estimation.

Abstract: Semantic Textual Relatedness (STR) captures nuanced relationships between
texts that extend beyond superficial lexical similarity. In this study, we
investigate STR in the context of job title matching - a key challenge in
resume recommendation systems, where overlapping terms are often limited or
misleading. We introduce a self-supervised hybrid architecture that combines
dense sentence embeddings with domain-specific Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to
improve both semantic alignment and explainability. Unlike previous work that
evaluated models on aggregate performance, our approach emphasizes data
stratification by partitioning the STR score continuum into distinct regions:
low, medium, and high semantic relatedness. This stratified evaluation enables
a fine-grained analysis of model performance across semantically meaningful
subspaces. We evaluate several embedding models, both with and without KG
integration via graph neural networks. The results show that fine-tuned SBERT
models augmented with KGs produce consistent improvements in the high-STR
region, where the RMSE is reduced by 25% over strong baselines. Our findings
highlight not only the benefits of combining KGs with text embeddings, but also
the importance of regional performance analysis in understanding model
behavior. This granular approach reveals strengths and weaknesses hidden by
global metrics, and supports more targeted model selection for use in Human
Resources (HR) systems and applications where fairness, explainability, and
contextual matching are essential.

Abstract: This system paper presents the DeMeVa team's approaches to the third edition

language models, where we compare example sampling strategies; and label
distribution learning (LDL) methods with RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019b), where we
evaluate several fine-tuning methods. Our contributions are twofold: (1) we
show that ICL can effectively predict annotator-specific annotations
(perspectivist annotations), and that aggregating these predictions into soft
labels yields competitive performance; and (2) we argue that LDL methods are
promising for soft label predictions and merit further exploration by the
perspectivist community.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly reshaped financial NLP, enabling
new tasks and driving a proliferation of datasets and diversification of data
sources. Yet, this transformation has outpaced traditional surveys. In this
paper, we present MetaGraph, a generalizable methodology for extracting
knowledge graphs from scientific literature and analyzing them to obtain a
structured, queryable view of research trends. We define an ontology for
financial NLP research and apply an LLM-based extraction pipeline to 681 papers
(2022-2025), enabling large-scale, data-driven analysis. MetaGraph reveals
three key phases: early LLM adoption and task/dataset innovation; critical
reflection on LLM limitations; and growing integration of peripheral techniques
into modular systems. This structured view offers both practitioners and
researchers a clear understanding of how financial NLP has evolved -
highlighting emerging trends, shifting priorities, and methodological
shifts-while also demonstrating a reusable approach for mapping scientific
progress in other domains.

TL;DR: 利用GPT的零样本能力从论坛介绍帖中推断Big-Five人格特质，并集成到SAMI系统中为人格感知的社交推荐提供支持


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线课程环境阻碍了社交群体的自然形成，SAMI系统因缺乏完整的心智理论而受限，特别是无法直觉人格特质，这影响了推荐的相关性

Method: 提出基于GPT零样本能力的人格检测模型，从论坛介绍帖推断Big-Five人格特质，并与现有模型进行性能对比，然后将该模型集成到SAMI的实体匹配系统中

Result: 模型在该任务上表现出有效性，初步集成表明人格特质可以补充现有匹配因素

Conclusion: 人格特质能够增强社交推荐系统，但需要进一步评估其对学生参与度和匹配质量的全面影响

Abstract: Social connection is a vital part of learning, yet online course environments
present barriers to the organic formation of social groups. SAMI offers one
solution by facilitating student connections, but its effectiveness is
constrained by an incomplete Theory of Mind, limiting its ability to create an
effective mental model of a student. One facet of this is its inability to
intuit personality, which may influence the relevance of its recommendations.
To explore this, we propose a personality detection model utilizing GPTs
zero-shot capability to infer Big-Five personality traits from forum
introduction posts, often encouraged in online courses. We benchmark its
performance against established models, demonstrating its efficacy in this
task. Furthermore, we integrate this model into SAMIs entity-based matchmaking
system, enabling personality-informed social recommendations. Initial
integration suggests personality traits can complement existing matching
factors, though additional evaluation is required to determine their full
impact on student engagement and match quality.

TL;DR: EXPRESS基准数据集评估LLMs在细粒度情感识别方面与人类情感的对齐程度，发现现有模型在准确预测与人类自我披露情感一致的情感方面仍存在挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要将情感分类为预定义的有限类别，忽视了更细微的情感表达，需要评估LLMs是否能在细粒度水平上与人类情感对齐。

Method: 引入EXPRESS基准数据集（包含251个细粒度情感标签），通过综合评估框架分析预测情感术语并将其分解为八种基本情感，系统测试主流LLMs在不同提示设置下的表现。

Result: LLMs准确预测与人类自我披露情感一致的情感仍然具有挑战性；某些LLMs能生成符合情感理论的情感术语，但在捕捉上下文线索方面不如人类自我披露有效。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在细粒度情感对齐方面的局限性，为未来增强其上下文理解能力的研究提供了见解。

Abstract: The versatility of Large Language Models (LLMs) in natural language
understanding has made them increasingly popular in mental health research.
While many studies explore LLMs' capabilities in emotion recognition, a
critical gap remains in evaluating whether LLMs align with human emotions at a
fine-grained level. Existing research typically focuses on classifying emotions
into predefined, limited categories, overlooking more nuanced expressions. To
address this gap, we introduce EXPRESS, a benchmark dataset curated from Reddit
communities featuring 251 fine-grained, self-disclosed emotion labels. Our
comprehensive evaluation framework examines predicted emotion terms and
decomposes them into eight basic emotions using established emotion theories,
enabling a fine-grained comparison. Systematic testing of prevalent LLMs under
various prompt settings reveals that accurately predicting emotions that align
with human self-disclosed emotions remains challenging. Qualitative analysis
further shows that while certain LLMs generate emotion terms consistent with
established emotion theories and definitions, they sometimes fail to capture
contextual cues as effectively as human self-disclosures. These findings
highlight the limitations of LLMs in fine-grained emotion alignment and offer
insights for future research aimed at enhancing their contextual understanding.

Motivation: 在医疗证明不可用的资源有限地区，口头尸检是估计死因的关键工具，需要提高其准确性以支持全球健康监测

Method: 结合大语言模型（LLMs）与传统算法方法和基于嵌入的分类，使用PHMRC数据集评估GPT-5预测、LCVA基线、文本嵌入和元学习器集成方法

Result: GPT-5获得最高个体性能：成人48.6%、儿童50.5%、新生儿53.5%的平均测试准确率，比传统统计机器学习基线高出5-10%

Conclusion: 现成的大语言模型辅助方法可以显著提高口头尸检准确性，对低收入地区的全球健康监测具有重要意义

Abstract: Verbal autopsy (VA) is a critical tool for estimating causes of death in
resource-limited settings where medical certification is unavailable. This
study presents LA-VA, a proof-of-concept pipeline that combines Large Language
Models (LLMs) with traditional algorithmic approaches and embedding-based
classification for improved cause-of-death prediction. Using the Population
Health Metrics Research Consortium (PHMRC) dataset across three age categories
(Adult: 7,580; Child: 1,960; Neonate: 2,438), we evaluate multiple approaches:
GPT-5 predictions, LCVA baseline, text embeddings, and meta-learner ensembles.
Our results demonstrate that GPT-5 achieves the highest individual performance
with average test site accuracies of 48.6% (Adult), 50.5% (Child), and 53.5%
(Neonate), outperforming traditional statistical machine learning baselines by
5-10%. Our findings suggest that simple off-the-shelf LLM-assisted approaches
could substantially improve verbal autopsy accuracy, with important
implications for global health surveillance in low-resource settings.

Motivation: 现有方法通常独立微调多智能体系统中的各个智能体，导致智能体间能力差距大、协作效果差

Method: 提出MOAT框架，包含两个关键阶段：规划智能体对齐（优化子目标生成）和接地智能体改进（使用多样化子目标-动作对进行微调）

Result: 在六个基准测试中超越最先进基线，在held-in任务上平均提升3.1%，在held-out任务上平均提升4.4%

Conclusion: MOAT通过迭代对齐机制有效解决了多智能体系统中的协作问题，理论分析证明其训练过程具有非递减性和渐进收敛性

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the construction
of multi-agent systems to solve complex tasks by dividing responsibilities
among specialized agents, such as a planning agent for subgoal generation and a
grounding agent for executing tool-use actions. Most existing methods typically
fine-tune these agents independently, leading to capability gaps among them
with poor coordination. To address this, we propose MOAT, a Multi-Agent Joint
Alignment Tuning framework that improves agents collaboration through iterative
alignment. MOAT alternates between two key stages: (1) Planning Agent
Alignment, which optimizes the planning agent to generate subgoal sequences
that better guide the grounding agent; and (2) Grounding Agent Improving, which
fine-tunes the grounding agent using diverse subgoal-action pairs generated by
the agent itself to enhance its generalization capablity. Theoretical analysis
proves that MOAT ensures a non-decreasing and progressively convergent training
process. Experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate that MOAT outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average improvements of 3.1% on held-in
tasks and 4.4% on held-out tasks.

TL;DR: 该论文通过Context-Aware Mean Ablation (CAMA)和Attention-Based Peeking (ABP)技术，在大语言模型的心算任务中识别出了一个All-for-One子图(AF1)，该子图在深层仅通过最后一个token进行计算，且对模型性能至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在计算任务上表现出色，但其内部工作机制仍不明确。研究者希望探究在实际操作中，模型如何在心算任务中进行信息处理和计算。

Method: 采用三步骤方法：抑制初始层的输入特定token计算、限制中间层token位置间的信息传递、强制剩余层在最后一个token进行计算。使用CAMA和ABP两种新技术来识别关键计算子图。

Result: 发现了一个All-for-One子图(AF1)，该子图在多种心算任务上保持高精度，计算发生在深层且仅通过最后一个token进行，通过特定中间层接收其他token的信息。

Conclusion: AF1子图对模型性能既充分又必要，能够跨模型迁移，适用于多种输入风格。CAMA和ABP技术相比其他方法具有独特优势。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate proficiency across numerous
computational tasks, yet their inner workings remain unclear. In theory, the
combination of causal self-attention and multilayer perceptron layers allows
every token to access and compute information based on all preceding tokens. In
practice, to what extent are such operations present? In this paper, on mental
math tasks (i.e., direct math calculation via next-token prediction without
explicit reasoning), we investigate this question in three steps: inhibiting
input-specific token computations in the initial layers, restricting the routes
of information transfer across token positions in the next few layers, and
forcing all computation to happen at the last token in the remaining layers.
With two proposed techniques, Context-Aware Mean Ablation (CAMA) and
Attention-Based Peeking (ABP), we identify an All-for-One subgraph (AF1) with
high accuracy on a wide variety of mental math tasks, where meaningful
computation occurs very late (in terms of layer depth) and only at the last
token, which receives information of other tokens in few specific middle
layers. Experiments on a variety of models and arithmetic expressions show that
this subgraph is sufficient and necessary for high model performance, transfers
across different models, and works on a variety of input styles. Ablations on
different CAMA and ABP alternatives reveal their unique advantages over other
methods, which may be of independent interest.

TL;DR: SteerMoE框架通过检测和控制MoE模型中的行为相关专家，能够在无需重新训练或修改权重的情况下，控制LLM的忠实性和安全性等行为表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MoE模型通过路由机制将token分配给不同的专家网络，但这些专家可能包含与特定行为相关的知识。研究旨在探索如何通过控制这些专家来精确调控模型行为。

Method: 提出检测方法识别在对比行为输入中具有不同激活模式的行为相关专家，通过在推理过程中选择性（去）激活这些专家来控制模型行为。

Result: 在11个基准测试和6个LLM上的实验显示，该方法可将安全性提升高达+20%，忠实性提升+27%。在对抗攻击模式下，单独使用可降低安全性-41%，与现有越狱方法结合可完全绕过所有安全防护。

Conclusion: SteerMoE揭示了MoE模型中专家层面存在对齐伪装的新维度，为模型行为控制提供了无需权重修改的有效方法，同时也暴露了潜在的安全风险。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) in Large Language Models (LLMs) routes each token
through a subset of specialized Feed-Forward Networks (FFN), known as experts.
We present SteerMoE, a framework for steering MoE models by detecting and
controlling behavior-linked experts. Our detection method identifies experts
with distinct activation patterns across paired inputs exhibiting contrasting
behaviors. By selectively (de)activating such experts during inference, we
control behaviors like faithfulness and safety without retraining or modifying
weights. Across 11 benchmarks and 6 LLMs, our steering raises safety by up to
+20% and faithfulness by +27%. In adversarial attack mode, it drops safety by
-41% alone, and -100% when combined with existing jailbreak methods, bypassing
all safety guardrails and exposing a new dimension of alignment faking hidden
within experts.

Motivation: 当前RLVR方法在探索能力上表现较差，容易出现过早收敛和熵排冲击问题，影响大语言模型的推理能力

Method: 提出好奇心驱动探索（CDE）框架，利用模型本身的内部好奇心来指导探索。通过演员的生成回复困惑度和评判者的多头估计方差作为探索奖励

Result: 在AIME指标上比标准RLVR方法（GRPO/PPO）提升了约3个点，理论分析证明演员奖励可以惩罚过于自信的错误并促进正确回复的多样性

Conclusion: 好奇心驱动探索框架有效解决了RLVR方法的探索问题，提升了模型性能，同时揭示了RLVR中存在的检定冲击机制

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a powerful paradigm
for enhancing the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet
current RLVR methods often explore poorly, leading to premature convergence and
entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we introduce Curiosity-Driven
Exploration (CDE), a framework that leverages the model's own intrinsic sense
of curiosity to guide exploration. We formalize curiosity with signals from
both the actor and the critic: for the actor, we use perplexity over its
generated response, and for the critic, we use the variance of value estimates
from a multi-head architecture. Both signals serve as an exploration bonus
within the RLVR framework to guide the model. Our theoretical analysis shows
that the actor-wise bonus inherently penalizes overconfident errors and
promotes diversity among correct responses; moreover, we connect the
critic-wise bonus to the well-established count-based exploration bonus in RL.
Empirically, our method achieves an approximate +3 point improvement over
standard RLVR using GRPO/PPO on AIME benchmarks. Further analysis identifies a
calibration collapse mechanism within RLVR, shedding light on common LLM
failure modes.

Motivation: 随着多模态检索在LLMs和多模态LLMs中的快速发展，出现了越来越复杂的检索任务。现有方法主要依赖于视觉语言模型的特定任务微调，且仅限于单模态查询或文档，无法满足多模态检索需求。

Method: 提出ReT-2模型，利用多层表示和循环Transformer架构，采用LSTM启发的门控机制动态整合跨层和跨模态信息，捕捉细粒度的视觉和文本细节。

Result: 在M2KR和M-BEIR基准测试中，ReT-2在不同检索配置下始终达到最先进的性能，同时提供更快的推理速度和更低的内存使用。在检索增强生成管道中集成时，还能提升Encyclopedic-VQA和InfoSeek数据集的下游性能。

Conclusion: ReT-2是一个高效统一的多模态检索模型，能够有效处理多模态查询和文档检索任务，在性能和效率方面均优于现有方法，为多模态检索提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of multimodal retrieval and its application in
LLMs and multimodal LLMs, increasingly complex retrieval tasks have emerged.
Existing methods predominantly rely on task-specific fine-tuning of
vision-language models and are limited to single-modality queries or documents.
In this paper, we propose ReT-2, a unified retrieval model that supports
multimodal queries, composed of both images and text, and searches across
multimodal document collections where text and images coexist. ReT-2 leverages
multi-layer representations and a recurrent Transformer architecture with
LSTM-inspired gating mechanisms to dynamically integrate information across
layers and modalities, capturing fine-grained visual and textual details. We
evaluate ReT-2 on the challenging M2KR and M-BEIR benchmarks across different
retrieval configurations. Results demonstrate that ReT-2 consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance across diverse settings, while offering faster
inference and reduced memory usage compared to prior approaches. When
integrated into retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, ReT-2 also improves
downstream performance on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek datasets. Our source

Conclusion: 视觉流散模型特征结合变换器聚合能够实现人类级别的动作识别演结性，为跨领域动作识别提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Humans can recognize the same actions despite large context and viewpoint
variations, such as differences between species (walking in spiders vs.
horses), viewpoints (egocentric vs. third-person), and contexts (real life vs
movies). Current deep learning models struggle with such generalization. We
propose using features generated by a Vision Diffusion Model (VDM), aggregated
via a transformer, to achieve human-like action recognition across these
challenging conditions. We find that generalization is enhanced by the use of a
model conditioned on earlier timesteps of the diffusion process to highlight
semantic information over pixel level details in the extracted features. We
experimentally explore the generalization properties of our approach in
classifying actions across animal species, across different viewing angles, and
different recording contexts. Our model sets a new state-of-the-art across all
three generalization benchmarks, bringing machine action recognition closer to
human-like robustness. Project page:

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications
poses unprecedented risks of generating harmful, biased, or misleading
information to vulnerable populations including LGBTQ+ individuals, single

prevent harmful outputs at the generation source. This paper introduces
PromptGuard, a novel modular prompting framework with our breakthrough
contribution: VulnGuard Prompt, a hybrid technique that prevents harmful

VulnGuard integrates few-shot examples from curated GitHub repositories,
ethical chain-of-thought reasoning, and adaptive role-prompting to create
population-specific protective barriers. Our framework employs theoretical
multi-objective optimization with formal proofs demonstrating 25-30% analytical
harm reduction through entropy bounds and Pareto optimality. PromptGuard
orchestrates six core modules: Input Classification, VulnGuard Prompting,
Ethical Principles Integration, External Tool Interaction, Output Validation,
and User-System Interaction, creating an intelligent expert system for
real-time harm prevention. We provide comprehensive mathematical formalization
including convergence proofs, vulnerability analysis using information theory,

Method: 采用孪生网络架构，提出Beta-SOD统计异常检测框架，使用双分量Beta分布混合模型建模嵌入对之间的余弦相似度分布，结合二元交叉熵、对比和余弦嵌入损失联合优化

Result: 在CUHK03、Market-1501和VeRi-776数据集上，在10-30%噪声水平下均优于现有最先进方法，展示了在噪声Re-ID场景中的鲁棒性和广泛适用性

Conclusion: Beta-SOD通过统计建模相似度分布有效处理Re-ID中的标签噪声问题，为噪声环境下的目标重识别提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Object re-identification (Re-ID) methods are highly sensitive to label noise,
which typically leads to significant performance degradation. We address this
challenge by reframing Re-ID as a supervised image similarity task and adopting
a Siamese network architecture trained to capture discriminative pairwise
relationships. Central to our approach is a novel statistical outlier detection
(OD) framework, termed Beta-SOD (Beta mixture Similarity-based Outlier
Detection), which models the distribution of cosine similarities between
embedding pairs using a two-component Beta distribution mixture model. We
establish a novel identifiability result for mixtures of two Beta
distributions, ensuring that our learning task is well-posed.The proposed OD
step complements the Re-ID architecture combining binary cross-entropy,
contrastive, and cosine embedding losses that jointly optimize feature-level
similarity learning.We demonstrate the effectiveness of Beta-SOD in de-noising
and Re-ID tasks for person Re-ID, on CUHK03 and Market-1501 datasets, and
vehicle Re-ID, on VeRi-776 dataset. Our method shows superior performance
compared to the state-of-the-art methods across various noise levels (10-30\%),
demonstrating both robustness and broad applicability in noisy Re-ID scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冠状动脉疾病是全球主要死因之一，ICA作为诊断金标准需要精确的血管分割和狭窄检测。但ICA图像具有低对比度、高噪声和复杂细粒度血管结构的特点，现有方法面临重大挑战。

Method: 提出SFD-Mamba2Net框架：编码器嵌入曲率感知结构增强模块(CASE)突出管状血管结构；解码器引入渐进高频感知模块(PHFP)，通过多级小波分解逐步细化高频细节并整合低频全局结构。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结构增强和频域细节优化，有效解决了ICA图像血管分割和狭窄检测的技术难题，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: Background: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of
death worldwide. Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA), regarded as the gold
standard for CAD diagnosis, necessitates precise vessel segmentation and
stenosis detection. However, ICA images are typically characterized by low
contrast, high noise levels, and complex, fine-grained vascular structures,
which pose significant challenges to the clinical adoption of existing
segmentation and detection methods. Objective: This study aims to improve the
accuracy of coronary artery segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA images
by integrating multi-scale structural priors, state-space-based long-range
dependency modeling, and frequency-domain detail enhancement strategies.
Methods: We propose SFD-Mamba2Net, an end-to-end framework tailored for
ICA-based vascular segmentation and stenosis detection. In the encoder, a
Curvature-Aware Structural Enhancement (CASE) module is embedded to leverage
multi-scale responses for highlighting slender tubular vascular structures,
suppressing background interference, and directing attention toward vascular
regions. In the decoder, we introduce a Progressive High-Frequency Perception
(PHFP) module that employs multi-level wavelet decomposition to progressively
refine high-frequency details while integrating low-frequency global
structures. Results and Conclusions: SFD-Mamba2Net consistently outperformed
state-of-the-art methods across eight segmentation metrics, and achieved the
highest true positive rate and positive predictive value in stenosis detection.

Conclusion: 集成自动化分割算法和政学生存分析可为CRLM提供准确、注释效率高且可解释性强的预后预测方案

Abstract: Colorectal cancer frequently metastasizes to the liver, significantly
reducing long-term survival. While surgical resection is the only potentially
curative treatment for colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM), patient outcomes
vary widely depending on tumor characteristics along with clinical and genomic
factors. Current prognostic models, often based on limited clinical or
molecular features, lack sufficient predictive power, especially in multifocal
CRLM cases. We present a fully automated framework for surgical outcome
prediction from pre- and post-contrast MRI acquired before surgery. Our
framework consists of a segmentation pipeline and a radiomics pipeline. The
segmentation pipeline learns to segment the liver, tumors, and spleen from
partially annotated data by leveraging promptable foundation models to complete
missing labels. Also, we propose SAMONAI, a novel zero-shot 3D prompt
propagation algorithm that leverages the Segment Anything Model to segment 3D
regions of interest from a single point prompt, significantly improving our
segmentation pipeline's accuracy and efficiency. The predicted pre- and
post-contrast segmentations are then fed into our radiomics pipeline, which
extracts features from each tumor and predicts survival using SurvAMINN, a
novel autoencoder-based multiple instance neural network for survival analysis.
SurvAMINN jointly learns dimensionality reduction and hazard prediction from
right-censored survival data, focusing on the most aggressive tumors. Extensive
evaluation on an institutional dataset comprising 227 patients demonstrates
that our framework surpasses existing clinical and genomic biomarkers,
delivering a C-index improvement exceeding 10%. Our results demonstrate the
potential of integrating automated segmentation algorithms and radiomics-based
survival analysis to deliver accurate, annotation-efficient, and interpretable

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同生成模型学习到的视觉表示何时以及如何出现分歧，发现一个模型产生而另一个模型不产生的视觉属性及其触发提示

Method: 引入CompCon进化搜索算法，自动发现模型输出中更普遍的视觉属性差异，并建立ID2数据集和自动化数据生成流程进行验证

Conclusion: CompCon能有效发现生成模型间的视觉表示差异，为理解模型偏差和表示学习提供了新工具

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate when and how visual representations learned by
two different generative models diverge. Given two text-to-image models, our
goal is to discover visual attributes that appear in images generated by one
model but not the other, along with the types of prompts that trigger these
attribute differences. For example, "flames" might appear in one model's
outputs when given prompts expressing strong emotions, while the other model
does not produce this attribute given the same prompts. We introduce CompCon
(Comparing Concepts), an evolutionary search algorithm that discovers visual
attributes more prevalent in one model's output than the other, and uncovers
the prompt concepts linked to these visual differences. To evaluate CompCon's
ability to find diverging representations, we create an automated data
generation pipeline to produce ID2, a dataset of 60 input-dependent
differences, and compare our approach to several LLM- and VLM-powered
baselines. Finally, we use CompCon to compare popular text-to-image models,
finding divergent representations such as how PixArt depicts prompts mentioning
loneliness with wet streets and Stable Diffusion 3.5 depicts African American
people in media professions. Code at: https://github.com/adobe-research/CompCon

Abstract: The use of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) has increased tremendously in the
current decade. They have significantly advanced remote sensing with the
capability to deploy and image the terrain as per required spatial, spectral,
temporal, and radiometric resolutions for various remote sensing applications.
One of the major advantages of UAS imagery is that images can be acquired in
cloudy conditions by flying the UAS under the clouds. The limitation to the
technology is that the imagery is often sullied by cloud shadows. Images taken
over water are additionally affected by sun glint. These are two pose serious
issues for estimating water quality parameters from the UAS images. This study
proposes a novel machine learning approach first to identify and extract
regions with cloud shadows and sun glint and separate such regions from
non-obstructed clear sky regions and sun-glint unaffected regions. The data was
extracted from the images at pixel level to train an U-Net based deep learning
model and best settings for model training was identified based on the various
evaluation metrics from test cases. Using this evaluation, a high-quality image
correction model was determined, which was used to recover the cloud shadow and
sun glint areas in the images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoSwin是一种结合卷积局部特征学习和Transformer全局注意力机制的新型视觉架构，通过在Swin Transformer的注意力块中集成可学习的局部特征增强模块，有效解决了ViT在小数据集上局部特征提取不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers虽然通过自注意力机制在计算机视觉任务中取得了显著成果，但在小数据集上过度关注全局上下文而忽略了局部特征提取，缺乏卷积网络的局部性和平移等变性等关键归纳偏置。

Method: 提出CoSwin架构，在分层移位窗口注意力机制的基础上融合局部卷积特征学习，在每个注意力块中集成可学习的局部特征增强模块，使模型能够同时捕获细粒度空间细节和全局语义结构。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、MNIST、SVHN和Tiny ImageNet等多个图像分类基准测试中，CoSwin相比最先进的卷积和基于Transformer的模型均取得一致性能提升，特别是在CIFAR-100上提升4.92%，Tiny ImageNet上提升4.47%。

Conclusion: 局部-全局特征融合有效增强了Transformer在小规模视觉任务中的泛化能力和鲁棒性，证明了结合卷积局部性和Transformer全局建模优势的架构设计价值。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved impressive results in computer
vision by leveraging self-attention to model long-range dependencies. However,
their emphasis on global context often comes at the expense of local feature
extraction in small datasets, particularly due to the lack of key inductive
biases such as locality and translation equivariance. To mitigate this, we
propose CoSwin, a novel feature-fusion architecture that augments the
hierarchical shifted window attention with localized convolutional feature
learning. Specifically, CoSwin integrates a learnable local feature enhancement
module into each attention block, enabling the model to simultaneously capture
fine-grained spatial details and global semantic structure. We evaluate CoSwin
on multiple image classification benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
MNIST, SVHN, and Tiny ImageNet. Our experimental results show consistent
performance gains over state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer-based
models. Notably, CoSwin achieves improvements of 2.17% on CIFAR-10, 4.92% on
CIFAR-100, 0.10% on MNIST, 0.26% on SVHN, and 4.47% on Tiny ImageNet over the
baseline Swin Transformer. These improvements underscore the effectiveness of
local-global feature fusion in enhancing the generalization and robustness of
transformers for small-scale vision. Code and pretrained weights available at

Motivation: 解决点云配准中特征匹配的几何一致性问题，通过结合局部和全局一致性来提高匹配精度和鲁棒性

Method: 使用局部图嵌入模块初始化得分矩阵，通过双向最近邻搜索进行重定位，然后通过全局几何一致性学习预测点对匹配概率

Conclusion: iMatcher通过完全可微的框架实现了卓越的点云匹配性能，在各种室内外场景中都表现出强大的鲁棒性和准确性

Abstract: This paper presents iMatcher, a fully differentiable framework for feature
matching in point cloud registration. The proposed method leverages learned
features to predict a geometrically consistent confidence matrix, incorporating
both local and global consistency. First, a local graph embedding module leads
to an initialization of the score matrix. A subsequent repositioning step
refines this matrix by considering bilateral source-to-target and
target-to-source matching via nearest neighbor search in 3D space. The paired
point features are then stacked together to be refined through global geometric
consistency learning to predict a point-wise matching probability. Extensive
experiments on real-world outdoor (KITTI, KITTI-360) and indoor (3DMatch)
datasets, as well as on 6-DoF pose estimation (TUD-L) and partial-to-partial
matching (MVP-RG), demonstrate that iMatcher significantly improves rigid
registration performance. The method achieves state-of-the-art inlier ratios,
scoring 95% - 97% on KITTI, 94% - 97% on KITTI-360, and up to 81.1% on 3DMatch,
highlighting its robustness across diverse settings.

Motivation: 传统隐式表示方法依赖精确标注且难以处理超声图像的视角依赖性和声学阴影伪影，需要利用B模式图像中的丰富声学信息来改进重建质量

Method: 提出基于占位表示的方法UltrON，利用B模式图像的声学特征进行弱监督优化，设计新的损失函数补偿视角依赖性，支持多视角超声优化

Conclusion: 该方法为更准确的3D重建铺平了道路，代码和数据集将开源提供

Abstract: In free-hand ultrasound imaging, sonographers rely on expertise to mentally
integrate partial 2D views into 3D anatomical shapes. Shape reconstruction can
assist clinicians in this process. Central to this task is the choice of shape
representation, as it determines how accurately and efficiently the structure
can be visualized, analyzed, and interpreted. Implicit representations, such as
SDF and occupancy function, offer a powerful alternative to traditional voxel-
or mesh-based methods by modeling continuous, smooth surfaces with compact
storage, avoiding explicit discretization. Recent studies demonstrate that SDF
can be effectively optimized using annotations derived from segmented B-mode
ultrasound images. Yet, these approaches hinge on precise annotations,
overlooking the rich acoustic information embedded in B-mode intensity.
Moreover, implicit representation approaches struggle with the ultrasound's
view-dependent nature and acoustic shadowing artifacts, which impair
reconstruction. To address the problems resulting from occlusions and
annotation dependency, we propose an occupancy-based representation and
introduce \gls{UltrON} that leverages acoustic features to improve geometric
consistency in weakly-supervised optimization regime. We show that these
features can be obtained from B-mode images without additional annotation cost.
Moreover, we propose a novel loss function that compensates for view-dependency
in the B-mode images and facilitates occupancy optimization from multiview
ultrasound. By incorporating acoustic properties, \gls{UltrON} generalizes to
shapes of the same anatomy. We show that \gls{UltrON} mitigates the limitations
of occlusions and sparse labeling and paves the way for more accurate 3D
reconstruction. Code and dataset will be available at

Motivation: 自动量化心肌运动和应变从标记MRI仍然是一个重要但具有挑战性的任务，需要开发更准确和高效的方法

Method: 使用基于学习潜在码的条件隐式神经表示(INRs)来预测连续左心室位移，无需推理时优化

Result: 在452个UK Biobank测试案例中，该方法实现了最佳跟踪精度(2.14 mm RMSE)和最低的全局周向(2.86%)和径向(6.42%)应变组合误差，比最准确的基线快约380倍

Conclusion: 基于INR的模型适用于大型CMR数据集中心肌应变的准确和可扩展分析

Abstract: Automatic quantification of intramyocardial motion and strain from tagging
MRI remains an important but challenging task. We propose a method using
implicit neural representations (INRs), conditioned on learned latent codes, to
predict continuous left ventricular (LV) displacement -- without requiring
inference-time optimisation. Evaluated on 452 UK Biobank test cases, our method
achieved the best tracking accuracy (2.14 mm RMSE) and the lowest combined
error in global circumferential (2.86%) and radial (6.42%) strain compared to
three deep learning baselines. In addition, our method is $\sim$380$\times$
faster than the most accurate baseline. These results highlight the suitability
of INR-based models for accurate and scalable analysis of myocardial strain in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E-MLNet通过动态加权策略改进通用域适应，在多个基准测试中显著优于MLNet基线


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的通用域适应方法如MLNet对所有分类器平等对待，导致学习信号稀释，需要更聚焦的适应策略

Method: 提出增强型互学习网络(E-MLNet)，集成动态加权策略到开放集熵最小化中，利用闭集分类器预测聚焦最相关的类边界

Result: 在四个基准测试中表现优异，在VisDA和ImageCLEF上获得最高平均H分数，在31个任务中22个优于基线

Conclusion: 动态加权策略能有效提升已知和未知类别的区分能力，证实了聚焦适应策略的优势

Abstract: Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) seeks to transfer knowledge from a
labeled source to an unlabeled target domain without assuming any relationship
between their label sets, requiring models to classify known samples while
rejecting unknown ones. Advanced methods like Mutual Learning Network (MLNet)
use a bank of one-vs-all classifiers adapted via Open-set Entropy Minimization
(OEM). However, this strategy treats all classifiers equally, diluting the
learning signal. We propose the Enhanced Mutual Learning Network (E-MLNet),
which integrates a dynamic weighting strategy to OEM. By leveraging the
closed-set classifier's predictions, E-MLNet focuses adaptation on the most
relevant class boundaries for each target sample, sharpening the distinction
between known and unknown classes. We conduct extensive experiments on four
challenging benchmarks: Office-31, Office-Home, VisDA-2017, and ImageCLEF. The
results demonstrate that E-MLNet achieves the highest average H-scores on VisDA
and ImageCLEF and exhibits superior robustness over its predecessor. E-MLNet
outperforms the strong MLNet baseline in the majority of individual adaptation
tasks -- 22 out of 31 in the challenging Open-Partial DA setting and 19 out of
31 in the Open-Set DA setting -- confirming the benefits of our focused
adaptation strategy.

TL;DR: COCO-Urdu是首个大规模乌尔都语图像字幕数据集，包含59,000张图片和319,000个高质量乌尔都语字幕，填补了乌尔都语在多模态研究中的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乌尔都语作为2.5亿人使用的语言，在多模态和视觉语言研究中严重缺乏支持，缺乏大规模高质量数据集限制了乌尔都语系统的发展，并加剧了多语言模型对高资源语言的偏见。

Method: 从MS COCO数据集通过分层抽样构建，使用SeamlessM4T v2进行翻译，并通过混合多模态质量评估框架（包括COMET-Kiwi翻译质量评估、CLIP视觉相似度、BERTScore语义一致性）进行验证和迭代优化。

Result: 数据集在BLEU、SacreBLEU和chrF基准测试中表现一致强劲，是目前最大的公开乌尔都语字幕数据集。

Conclusion: 通过发布数据集和质量评估流程，旨在减少多模态研究中的语言偏见，为包容性视觉语言系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Urdu, spoken by over 250 million people, remains critically under-served in
multimodal and vision-language research. The absence of large-scale,
high-quality datasets has limited the development of Urdu-capable systems and
reinforced biases in multilingual vision-language models trained primarily on
high-resource languages. To address this gap, we present COCO-Urdu, a
large-scale image-caption dataset derived from MS COCO, containing 59,000
images and 319,000 Urdu captions selected through stratified sampling to
preserve the original distribution. Captions were translated using SeamlessM4T
v2 and validated with a hybrid multimodal quality estimation framework that
integrates COMET-Kiwi for translation quality, CLIP-based similarity for visual
grounding, and BERTScore with back-translation for semantic consistency;
low-scoring captions were iteratively refined using open-source large language
models. We further benchmark COCO-Urdu on BLEU, SacreBLEU, and chrF, reporting
consistently strong results. To the best of our knowledge, COCO-Urdu is the
largest publicly available Urdu captioning dataset. By releasing both the
dataset and the quality estimation pipeline, we aim to reduce language bias in
multimodal research and establish a foundation for inclusive vision-language
systems.

Method: 结合Token Merging Transformer进行高效体素压缩，以及查询驱动的Q-Former生成与CLIP图像嵌入空间对齐的固定大小神经表示

Result: 在7T自然场景数据集上，VoxelFormer在训练包含的主体上实现了有竞争力的检索性能，且参数数量显著少于现有方法

Conclusion: token合并和基于查询的transformer是参数高效神经解码的有前景策略

Abstract: Recent advances in fMRI-based visual decoding have enabled compelling
reconstructions of perceived images. However, most approaches rely on
subject-specific training, limiting scalability and practical deployment. We
introduce \textbf{VoxelFormer}, a lightweight transformer architecture that
enables multi-subject training for visual decoding from fMRI. VoxelFormer
integrates a Token Merging Transformer (ToMer) for efficient voxel compression
and a query-driven Q-Former that produces fixed-size neural representations
aligned with the CLIP image embedding space. Evaluated on the 7T Natural Scenes
Dataset, VoxelFormer achieves competitive retrieval performance on subjects
included during training with significantly fewer parameters than existing
methods. These results highlight token merging and query-based transformers as
promising strategies for parameter-efficient neural decoding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D脑部MRI研究需要检测细微的形态学差异，但现有反事实生成模型缺乏明确的解剖学偏置，导致生成的图像解剖学不可行，无法保留医学相关的细微局部变化。

Method: 提出概率因果图模型(PCGM)，通过概率图模块捐捕解剖学约束，并将其转换为空间二进制掩码。使用3D ControlNet扩展编码掩码，约束新的反事实去噪UNet，最终通过3D滴水解码器生成高质量脑部MRI。

Result: PCGM在多个数据集上生成的结构脑部MRI质量超过多个基线方法。主要成就是首次证明从PCGM生成的反事实图像中提取的脑部测量能够复现疾病对监幂脑区域的细微影响，这与神经科学文献中之前报道的结果一致。

Conclusion: PCGM在保留细微解剖学变化方面的成功，为使用合成MRI研究细微形态学差异标志着重要里程碑。

Abstract: 3D brain MRI studies often examine subtle morphometric differences between
cohorts that are hard to detect visually. Given the high cost of MRI
acquisition, these studies could greatly benefit from image syntheses,
particularly counterfactual image generation, as seen in other domains, such as
computer vision. However, counterfactual models struggle to produce
anatomically plausible MRIs due to the lack of explicit inductive biases to
preserve fine-grained anatomical details. This shortcoming arises from the
training of the models aiming to optimize for the overall appearance of the
images (e.g., via cross-entropy) rather than preserving subtle, yet medically
relevant, local variations across subjects. To preserve subtle variations, we
propose to explicitly integrate anatomical constraints on a voxel-level as
prior into a generative diffusion framework. Called Probabilistic Causal Graph
Model (PCGM), the approach captures anatomical constraints via a probabilistic
graph module and translates those constraints into spatial binary masks of
regions where subtle variations occur. The masks (encoded by a 3D extension of
ControlNet) constrain a novel counterfactual denoising UNet, whose encodings
are then transferred into high-quality brain MRIs via our 3D diffusion decoder.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that PCGM generates
structural brain MRIs of higher quality than several baseline approaches.
Furthermore, we show for the first time that brain measurements extracted from
counterfactuals (generated by PCGM) replicate the subtle effects of a disease
on cortical brain regions previously reported in the neuroscience literature.
This achievement is an important milestone in the use of synthetic MRIs in
studies investigating subtle morphological differences.

Abstract: Understanding 3D medical image volumes is critical in the medical field, yet
existing 3D medical convolution and transformer-based self-supervised learning
(SSL) methods often lack deep semantic comprehension. Recent advancements in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) provide a promising approach to
enhance image understanding through text descriptions. To leverage these 2D
MLLMs for improved 3D medical image understanding, we propose Med3DInsight, a
novel pretraining framework that integrates 3D image encoders with 2D MLLMs via
a specially designed plane-slice-aware transformer module. Additionally, our
model employs a partial optimal transport based alignment, demonstrating
greater tolerance to noise introduced by potential noises in LLM-generated

medical representation learning without requiring human annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance on two downstream
tasks, i.e., segmentation and classification, across various public datasets
with CT and MRI modalities, outperforming current SSL methods. Med3DInsight can
be seamlessly integrated into existing 3D medical image understanding networks,

Abstract: Recent graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) have shown high performance
in the field of human action recognition by using human skeleton poses.
However, it fails to detect human-object interaction cases successfully due to
the lack of effective representation of the scene information and appropriate
learning architectures. In this context, we propose a methodology to utilize
human action recognition performance by considering fixed object information in
the environment and following a multi-task learning approach. In order to
evaluate the proposed method, we collected real data from public environments
and prepared our data set, which includes interaction classes of hands-on fixed
objects (e.g., ATM ticketing machines, check-in/out machines, etc.) and
non-interaction classes of walking and standing. The multi-task learning
approach, along with interaction area information, succeeds in recognizing the
studied interaction and non-interaction actions with an accuracy of 99.25%,
outperforming the accuracy of the base model using only human skeleton poses by
2.75%.

Conclusion: IRDFusion框架通过迭代反馈机制强化显著关系信号并压制特征噪声，实现了高质量的跨模态融合，为多光谱物体检测领域提供了一种有效的解决方案

Abstract: Current multispectral object detection methods often retain extraneous
background or noise during feature fusion, limiting perceptual performance.To
address this, we propose an innovative feature fusion framework based on
cross-modal feature contrastive and screening strategy, diverging from
conventional approaches. The proposed method adaptively enhances salient
structures by fusing object-aware complementary cross-modal features while
suppressing shared background interference.Our solution centers on two novel,
specially designed modules: the Mutual Feature Refinement Module (MFRM) and the
Differential Feature Feedback Module (DFFM). The MFRM enhances intra- and
inter-modal feature representations by modeling their relationships, thereby
improving cross-modal alignment and discriminative power.Inspired by feedback
differential amplifiers, the DFFM dynamically computes inter-modal differential
features as guidance signals and feeds them back to the MFRM, enabling adaptive
fusion of complementary information while suppressing common-mode noise across
modalities. To enable robust feature learning, the MFRM and DFFM are integrated
into a unified framework, which is formally formulated as an Iterative
Relation-Map Differential Guided Feature Fusion mechanism, termed IRDFusion.
IRDFusion enables high-quality cross-modal fusion by progressively amplifying
salient relational signals through iterative feedback, while suppressing
feature noise, leading to significant performance gains.In extensive
experiments on FLIR, LLVIP and M$^3$FD datasets, IRDFusion achieves
state-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms existing methods
across diverse challenging scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and
effectiveness. Code will be available at

Motivation: 现有的VLA模型计算和内存成本过高，现有压缩方法无法同时实现量化和token剪枝，存在不兼容问题

Method: 提出新的量化感知token剪枝标准，在激进量化模型上工作，同时改进量化器设计以增强剪枝效果

Result: 在标准VLA模型上实现1.93倍推理加速，平均成功率提升4.5%，同时保持核心模型性能

Conclusion: SQAP-VLA首次实现了量化和token剪枝的协同优化，为VLA模型的实用部署提供了有效的推理加速解决方案

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models exhibit unprecedented capabilities for
embodied intelligence. However, their extensive computational and memory costs
hinder their practical deployment. Existing VLA compression and acceleration
approaches conduct quantization or token pruning in an ad-hoc manner but fail
to enable both for a holistic efficiency improvement due to an observed
incompatibility. This work introduces SQAP-VLA, the first structured,
training-free VLA inference acceleration framework that simultaneously enables
state-of-the-art quantization and token pruning. We overcome the
incompatibility by co-designing the quantization and token pruning pipeline,
where we propose new quantization-aware token pruning criteria that work on an
aggressively quantized model while improving the quantizer design to enhance
pruning effectiveness. When applied to standard VLA models, SQAP-VLA yields
significant gains in computational efficiency and inference speed while
successfully preserving core model performance, achieving a $\times$1.93
speedup and up to a 4.5\% average success rate enhancement compared to the
original model.

TL;DR: S-BEVLoc是一个基于鸟瞰图的自监督LiDAR全局定位框架，无需地面真值位姿，通过地理距离构建训练三元组，在KITTI和NCLT数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LiDAR全局定位方法依赖于GPS或SLAM里程计提供的地面真值位姿进行监督训练，但高精度地面真值位姿的获取成本高、工作量大。

Method: 提出自监督框架S-BEVLoc，利用单张BEV图像构建训练三元组，通过已知地理距离生成关键点中心的BEV补丁，使用CNN提取局部特征，NetVLAD聚合全局描述符，并引入SoftCos损失函数。

Result: 在KITTI和NCLT大规模数据集上的实验结果表明，S-BEVLoc在位置识别、闭环检测和全局定位任务中达到了最先进的性能，同时具有更好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: S-BEVLoc成功消除了对地面真值位姿的依赖，提供了一种高可扩展性的自监督LiDAR全局定位解决方案，在多个任务上表现出色。

Abstract: LiDAR-based global localization is an essential component of simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM), which helps loop closure and re-localization.
Current approaches rely on ground-truth poses obtained from GPS or SLAM
odometry to supervise network training. Despite the great success of these
supervised approaches, substantial cost and effort are required for
high-precision ground-truth pose acquisition. In this work, we propose
S-BEVLoc, a novel self-supervised framework based on bird's-eye view (BEV) for
LiDAR global localization, which eliminates the need for ground-truth poses and
is highly scalable. We construct training triplets from single BEV images by
leveraging the known geographic distances between keypoint-centered BEV
patches. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract local features,
and NetVLAD is employed to aggregate global descriptors. Moreover, we introduce
SoftCos loss to enhance learning from the generated triplets. Experimental
results on the large-scale KITTI and NCLT datasets show that S-BEVLoc achieves
state-of-the-art performance in place recognition, loop closure, and global
localization tasks, while offering scalability that would require extra effort
for supervised approaches.

Result: 提供了基线结果，分析了在不同物体大小、遮挡水平和环境条件下的性能表现

Conclusion: FPI-Det数据集为细粒度人机交互检测提供了新的基准，有助于推动相关领域的研究发展

Abstract: The widespread use of mobile devices has created new challenges for vision
systems in safety monitoring, workplace productivity assessment, and attention
management. Detecting whether a person is using a phone requires not only
object recognition but also an understanding of behavioral context, which
involves reasoning about the relationship between faces, hands, and devices
under diverse conditions. Existing generic benchmarks do not fully capture such
fine-grained human--device interactions. To address this gap, we introduce the
FPI-Det, containing 22{,}879 images with synchronized annotations for faces and
phones across workplace, education, transportation, and public scenarios. The
dataset features extreme scale variation, frequent occlusions, and varied
capture conditions. We evaluate representative YOLO and DETR detectors,
providing baseline results and an analysis of performance across object sizes,
occlusion levels, and environments. Source code and dataset is available at

TL;DR: ZeroPlantSeg是一种零样本分割方法，无需训练即可从顶视图图像中分割莲座状植物个体，通过结合基础分割模型和视觉语言模型来解决层次分割挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础分割模型能够零样本提取叶片实例，但分割包含多个重叠叶片的完整植物个体仍然困难，这需要物种特定的标注数据集和大量人工劳动。

Method: 整合基础分割模型（提取叶片实例）和视觉语言模型（推理植物结构）来提取植物个体，无需额外训练。

Result: 在多物种、不同生长阶段和拍摄环境的数据集上评估，该方法超越了现有零样本方法，并比监督方法具有更好的跨域性能。

Conclusion: ZeroPlantSeg提供了一种有效的零样本解决方案，能够准确分割植物个体，减少对标注数据的依赖，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Foundation segmentation models achieve reasonable leaf instance extraction
from top-view crop images without training (i.e., zero-shot). However,
segmenting entire plant individuals with each consisting of multiple
overlapping leaves remains challenging. This problem is referred to as a
hierarchical segmentation task, typically requiring annotated training
datasets, which are often species-specific and require notable human labor. To
address this, we introduce ZeroPlantSeg, a zero-shot segmentation for
rosette-shaped plant individuals from top-view images. We integrate a
foundation segmentation model, extracting leaf instances, and a vision-language
model, reasoning about plants' structures to extract plant individuals without
additional training. Evaluations on datasets with multiple plant species,
growth stages, and shooting environments demonstrate that our method surpasses
existing zero-shot methods and achieves better cross-domain performance than
supervised methods. Implementations are available at

TL;DR: 该论文针对CLIP在人物表示学习中的局限性，提出了数据构建和模型架构的协同改进方案，包括构建WebPerson数据集和GA-DMS框架，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在人物表示学习中面临两个关键挑战：(1)缺乏大规模标注的人物中心视觉语言数据；(2)全局对比学习难以保持细粒度匹配所需的判别性局部特征，且对噪声文本标记敏感。

Method: 1) 利用MLLM的上下文学习能力构建噪声抵抗的数据管道，自动过滤和标注网络图像，创建包含500万高质量人物图像-文本对的WebPerson数据集；2) 提出GA-DMS框架，基于梯度-注意力相似性分数自适应掩码噪声文本标记，并引入掩码标记预测目标来增强细粒度语义表示学习。

Result: 大量实验表明，GA-DMS在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过数据策展和模型架构的协同改进，成功提升了CLIP在人物表示学习中的表现，解决了数据稀缺和噪声敏感性问题。

Abstract: Although Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) exhibits strong
performance across diverse vision tasks, its application to person
representation learning faces two critical challenges: (i) the scarcity of
large-scale annotated vision-language data focused on person-centric images,
and (ii) the inherent limitations of global contrastive learning, which
struggles to maintain discriminative local features crucial for fine-grained
matching while remaining vulnerable to noisy text tokens. This work advances
CLIP for person representation learning through synergistic improvements in
data curation and model architecture. First, we develop a noise-resistant data
construction pipeline that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of
MLLMs to automatically filter and caption web-sourced images. This yields
WebPerson, a large-scale dataset of 5M high-quality person-centric image-text
pairs. Second, we introduce the GA-DMS (Gradient-Attention Guided Dual-Masking
Synergetic) framework, which improves cross-modal alignment by adaptively
masking noisy textual tokens based on the gradient-attention similarity score.
Additionally, we incorporate masked token prediction objectives that compel the
model to predict informative text tokens, enhancing fine-grained semantic
representation learning. Extensive experiments show that GA-DMS achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ALL-PET是一个低资源、低样本的PET投影域基础模型，通过潜在扩散模型和三项创新技术，仅用500个样本就能实现高质量sinogram生成，并在多种PET任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决PET成像中标记数据有限和计算资源不足的问题，克服数据稀缺和效率限制，构建大规模基础模型。

Method: 采用潜在扩散模型(LDM)，包含三项关键技术：1)Radon掩码增强策略(RMAS)生成20万+多样化训练样本；2)正负掩码约束嵌入几何一致性；3)透明医学注意力(TMA)机制增强病灶相关区域。

Result: 仅使用500个样本就能实现高质量sinogram生成，性能可与大数据集训练模型相媲美，内存使用低于24GB，在低剂量重建、衰减校正、延迟帧预测和示踪剂分离等任务中均表现良好。

Conclusion: ALL-PET成功解决了PET成像中的数据稀缺问题，提供了一个高效、灵活且可解释的基础模型框架，在多种临床应用场景中展现出强大泛化能力。

Abstract: Building large-scale foundation model for PET imaging is hindered by limited
access to labeled data and insufficient computational resources. To overcome
data scarcity and efficiency limitations, we propose ALL-PET, a low-resource,
low-shot PET foundation model operating directly in the projection domain.
ALL-PET leverages a latent diffusion model (LDM) with three key innovations.
First, we design a Radon mask augmentation strategy (RMAS) that generates over
200,000 structurally diverse training samples by projecting randomized
image-domain masks into sinogram space, significantly improving generalization
with minimal data. This is extended by a dynamic multi-mask (DMM) mechanism
that varies mask quantity and distribution, enhancing data diversity without
added model complexity. Second, we implement positive/negative mask constraints
to embed strict geometric consistency, reducing parameter burden while
preserving generation quality. Third, we introduce transparent medical
attention (TMA), a parameter-free, geometry-driven mechanism that enhances
lesion-related regions in raw projection data. Lesion-focused attention maps
are derived from coarse segmentation, covering both hypermetabolic and
hypometabolic areas, and projected into sinogram space for physically
consistent guidance. The system supports clinician-defined ROI adjustments,
ensuring flexible, interpretable, and task-adaptive emphasis aligned with PET
acquisition physics. Experimental results show ALL-PET achieves high-quality
sinogram generation using only 500 samples, with performance comparable to
models trained on larger datasets. ALL-PET generalizes across tasks including
low-dose reconstruction, attenuation correction, delayed-frame prediction, and
tracer separation, operating efficiently with memory use under 24GB.

Motivation: 研究神经网络与持续同调方法在拓扑结构推断方面的对比，特别是在噪声环境下的性能表现

Method: 使用监督神经网络预测2D二值图像的Betti数，与基于立方复形和SEDT的PH流程进行比较，使用1个合成数据集和2个真实数据集进行测试

Result: 神经网络在噪声条件下优于PH方法，这归因于神经网络能够从训练数据中学习上下文和几何先验

Conclusion: 尽管仍处于发展阶段，但使用神经网络进行拓扑估计为结构噪声下的拓扑分析提供了有吸引力的替代方案

Abstract: Persistent Homology (PH) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) offer
contrasting approaches to inferring topological structure from data. In this
study, we examine the noise robustness of a supervised neural network trained
to predict Betti numbers in 2D binary images. We compare an ANN approach
against a PH pipeline based on cubical complexes and the Signed Euclidean
Distance Transform (SEDT), which is a widely adopted strategy for noise-robust
topological analysis. Using one synthetic and two real-world datasets, we show
that ANNs can outperform this PH approach under noise, likely due to their
capacity to learn contextual and geometric priors from training data. Though
still emerging, the use of ANNs for topology estimation offers a compelling
alternative to PH under structural noise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指标主要评估整体图像质量，与人类感知存在差异。基于神经心理学研究，人类对3D场景的识别主要关注单个对象

Method: 利用对象检测模型及其特征表示来量化场景中每个对象的"对象性"，实现以对象为中心的评估

Result: 用户研究表明OSIM比现有指标更符合人类感知，并对近期3D重建和生成模型进行了标准化重新评估

Conclusion: OSIM提供了一个更符合人类感知的3D场景评估框架，有助于更准确地衡量该领域的技术进展

Abstract: This paper presents Objectness SIMilarity (OSIM), a novel evaluation metric
for 3D scenes that explicitly focuses on "objects," which are fundamental units
of human visual perception. Existing metrics assess overall image quality,
leading to discrepancies with human perception. Inspired by neuropsychological
insights, we hypothesize that human recognition of 3D scenes fundamentally
involves attention to individual objects. OSIM enables object-centric
evaluations by leveraging an object detection model and its feature
representations to quantify the "objectness" of each object in the scene. Our
user study demonstrates that OSIM aligns more closely with human perception
compared to existing metrics. We also analyze the characteristics of OSIM using
various approaches. Moreover, we re-evaluate recent 3D reconstruction and
generation models under a standardized experimental setup to clarify
advancements in this field. The code is available at

Conclusion: 该综述不仅提供了全面的回顾性分析，还为通用视频理解的未来发展提供了规范性路线图，强调模型设计应与数据集不变性对齐，同时平衡可扩展性和任务需求。

Abstract: Video understanding has advanced rapidly, fueled by increasingly complex
datasets and powerful architectures. Yet existing surveys largely classify
models by task or family, overlooking the structural pressures through which
datasets guide architectural evolution. This survey is the first to adopt a
dataset-driven perspective, showing how motion complexity, temporal span,
hierarchical composition, and multimodal richness impose inductive biases that
models should encode. We reinterpret milestones, from two-stream and 3D CNNs to
sequential, transformer, and multimodal foundation models, as concrete
responses to these dataset-driven pressures. Building on this synthesis, we
offer practical guidance for aligning model design with dataset invariances
while balancing scalability and task demands. By unifying datasets, inductive
biases, and architectures into a coherent framework, this survey provides both
a comprehensive retrospective and a prescriptive roadmap for advancing
general-purpose video understanding.

Abstract: Pathologists routinely alternate between different magnifications when
examining Whole-Slide Images, allowing them to evaluate both broad tissue
morphology and intricate cellular details to form comprehensive diagnoses.
However, existing deep learning-based cell detection models struggle to
replicate these behaviors and learn the interdependent semantics between
structures at different magnifications. A key barrier in the field is the lack
of datasets with multi-scale overlapping cell and tissue annotations. The
OCELOT 2023 challenge was initiated to gather insights from the community to
validate the hypothesis that understanding cell and tissue (cell-tissue)
interactions is crucial for achieving human-level performance, and to
accelerate the research in this field. The challenge dataset includes
overlapping cell detection and tissue segmentation annotations from six organs,
comprising 673 pairs sourced from 306 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
Whole-Slide Images with hematoxylin and eosin staining, divided into training,
validation, and test subsets. Participants presented models that significantly
enhanced the understanding of cell-tissue relationships. Top entries achieved
up to a 7.99 increase in F1-score on the test set compared to the baseline
cell-only model that did not incorporate cell-tissue relationships. This is a
substantial improvement in performance over traditional cell-only detection
methods, demonstrating the need for incorporating multi-scale semantics into
the models. This paper provides a comparative analysis of the methods used by
participants, highlighting innovative strategies implemented in the OCELOT 2023
challenge.

Abstract: Object detection in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery presents
significant challenges. Issues such as densely packed small objects, scale
variations, and occlusion are commonplace. This paper introduces RT-DETR++,
which enhances the encoder component of the RT-DETR model. Our improvements
focus on two key aspects. First, we introduce a channel-gated attention-based
upsampling/downsampling (AU/AD) mechanism. This dual-path system minimizes
errors and preserves details during feature layer propagation. Second, we
incorporate CSP-PAC during feature fusion. This technique employs parallel
hollow convolutions to process local and contextual information within the same
layer, facilitating the integration of multi-scale features. Evaluation
demonstrates that our novel neck design achieves superior performance in
detecting small and densely packed objects. The model maintains sufficient
speed for real-time detection without increasing computational complexity. This

Motivation: 现有KB-VQA方法直接使用检索到的知识会引入大量冗余和噪声，影响回答准确性。需要一种能够减少噪声、提高知识相关性的方法。

Conclusion: 通过知识聚焦框架，有效减少了KB-VQA中的知识冗余和噪声影响，提高了回答的准确性，为知识基视觉问答任务提供了一种高效的无需训练解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires a model to
understand images and utilize external knowledge to provide accurate answers.
Existing approaches often directly augment models with retrieved information
from knowledge sources while ignoring substantial knowledge redundancy, which
introduces noise into the answering process. To address this, we propose a
training-free framework with knowledge focusing for KB-VQA, that mitigates the
impact of noise by enhancing knowledge relevance and reducing redundancy.
First, for knowledge retrieval, our framework concludes essential parts from
the image-question pairs, creating low-noise queries that enhance the retrieval
of highly relevant knowledge. Considering that redundancy still persists in the
retrieved knowledge, we then prompt large models to identify and extract
answer-beneficial segments from knowledge. In addition, we introduce a
selective knowledge integration strategy, allowing the model to incorporate
knowledge only when it lacks confidence in answering the question, thereby
mitigating the influence of redundant information. Our framework enables the
acquisition of accurate and critical knowledge, and extensive experiments
demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CWSSNet框架有效突破了传统方法的分类性能瓶颈，具有良好的鲁棒性，适用于小样本训练条件的高光谱地物分类

Abstract: Hyperspectral remote sensing technology has significant application value in
fields such as forestry ecology and precision agriculture, while also putting
forward higher requirements for fine ground object classification. However,
although hyperspectral images are rich in spectral information and can improve
recognition accuracy, they tend to cause prominent feature redundancy due to
their numerous bands, high dimensionality, and spectral mixing characteristics.
To address this, this study used hyperspectral images from the ZY1F satellite
as a data source and selected Yugan County, Shangrao City, Jiangxi Province as
the research area to perform ground object classification research. A
classification framework named CWSSNet was proposed, which integrates 3D
spectral-spatial features and wavelet convolution. This framework integrates
multimodal information us-ing a multiscale convolutional attention module and
breaks through the classification performance bottleneck of traditional methods
by introducing multi-band decomposition and convolution operations in the
wavelet domain. The experiments showed that CWSSNet achieved 74.50\%, 82.73\%,
and 84.94\% in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), mean Accuracy (mAcc), and
mean F1-score (mF1) respectively in Yugan County. It also obtained the highest
Intersection over Union (IoU) in the classifica-tion of water bodies,
vegetation, and bare land, demonstrating good robustness. Additionally, when
the training set proportion was 70\%, the increase in training time was
limited, and the classification effect was close to the optimal level,
indicating that the model maintains reliable performance under small-sample
training conditions.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, highly realistic image

Although AI-generated image detection methods have partially addressed these
concerns, a substantial research gap remains in evaluating their performance
under complex real-world conditions. This paper introduces the Real-World
Robustness Dataset (RRDataset) for comprehensive evaluation of detection models
across three dimensions: 1) Scenario Generalization: RRDataset encompasses
high-quality images from seven major scenarios (War and Conflict, Disasters and
Accidents, Political and Social Events, Medical and Public Health, Culture and
Religion, Labor and Production, and everyday life), addressing existing dataset
gaps from a content perspective. 2) Internet Transmission Robustness: examining
detector performance on images that have undergone multiple rounds of sharing
across various social media platforms. 3) Re-digitization Robustness: assessing
model effectiveness on images altered through four distinct re-digitization
methods. We benchmarked 17 detectors and 10 vision-language models (VLMs) on
RRDataset and conducted a large-scale human study involving 192 participants to
investigate human few-shot learning capabilities in detecting AI-generated

### [71] [Dark-ISP: Enhancing RAW Image Processing for Low-Light Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09183)
*Jiasheng Guo,Xin Gao,Yuxiang Yan,Guanghao Li,Jian Pu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种轻量级自适应Dark-ISP插件，直接处理Bayer RAW图像来改善明照环境下的物体检测性能，避免了传统ISP流程的信息损失和复杂性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 明照环境下的物体检测面临图像质量氛化挑战，虽然RAW图像比RGB图像有更好潜力，但现有方法或有信息损失或复杂度过高。

Method: 将传统ISP流程解构为线性传感器校准和非线性调色映射子模块，改造为可微分组件，通过任务驱动损失优化，每个模块具备内容感知适配性和物理先验知识，设计了Self-Boost机制促进子模块协作。

Result: 在三个RAW图像数据集上的实验表明，该方法在具有挑战性的明照环境中超越了现有的RGB和RAW基于检测方法，以最少的参数量获得了更优的结果。

Conclusion: Dark-ISP提供了一种轻量级且可端到端训练的解决方案，通过重构ISP流程和自适应机制，有效提升了明照环境下的物体检测性能。

Abstract: Low-light Object detection is crucial for many real-world applications but
remains challenging due to degraded image quality. While recent studies have
shown that RAW images offer superior potential over RGB images, existing
approaches either use RAW-RGB images with information loss or employ complex
frameworks. To address these, we propose a lightweight and self-adaptive Image
Signal Processing (ISP) plugin, Dark-ISP, which directly processes Bayer RAW
images in dark environments, enabling seamless end-to-end training for object
detection. Our key innovations are: (1) We deconstruct conventional ISP
pipelines into sequential linear (sensor calibration) and nonlinear (tone
mapping) sub-modules, recasting them as differentiable components optimized
through task-driven losses. Each module is equipped with content-aware
adaptability and physics-informed priors, enabling automatic RAW-to-RGB
conversion aligned with detection objectives. (2) By exploiting the ISP
pipeline's intrinsic cascade structure, we devise a Self-Boost mechanism that
facilitates cooperation between sub-modules. Through extensive experiments on
three RAW image datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art RGB- and RAW-based detection approaches, achieving superior
results with minimal parameters in challenging low-light environments.

*Ge Sun,Jun Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MGTraj是一种新颖的多粒度目标引导轨迹预测模型，通过从粗到细的递归编码和Transformer架构，在多个粒度级别上整合特征，显著提升了人类轨迹预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有目标引导方法在粗粒度目标预测和细粒度轨迹补全之间存在粒度鸿沟，中间时间粒度的潜在效用未被充分探索，多粒度表示虽然能捕捉不同尺度的人类动态模式，但如何有效整合到目标引导框架中仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: 多粒度建模方法有效解决了目标引导轨迹预测中的粒度不匹配问题，递归精炼机制和跨粒度特征整合策略显著提升了预测精度，为人类轨迹预测提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate human trajectory prediction is crucial for robotics navigation and
autonomous driving. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating goal
guidance significantly enhances prediction accuracy by reducing uncertainty and
leveraging prior knowledge. Most goal-guided approaches decouple the prediction
task into two stages: goal prediction and subsequent trajectory completion
based on the predicted goal, which operate at extreme granularities:
coarse-grained goal prediction forecasts the overall intention, while
fine-grained trajectory completion needs to generate the positions for all
future timesteps. The potential utility of intermediate temporal granularity
remains largely unexplored, which motivates multi-granularity trajectory
modeling. While prior work has shown that multi-granularity representations
capture diverse scales of human dynamics and motion patterns, effectively
integrating this concept into goal-guided frameworks remains challenging. In
this paper, we propose MGTraj, a novel Multi-Granularity goal-guided model for
human Trajectory prediction. MGTraj recursively encodes trajectory proposals
from coarse to fine granularity levels. At each level, a transformer-based
recursive refinement network (RRN) captures features and predicts progressive
refinements. Features across different granularities are integrated using a
weight-sharing strategy, and velocity prediction is employed as an auxiliary
task to further enhance performance. Comprehensive experimental results in
EHT/UCY and Stanford Drone Dataset indicate that MGTraj outperforms baseline
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance among goal-guided methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在材料科学中显示出潜力，但其对真实世界材料表征成像数据的理解能力尚未充分探索，需要建立专门的评估基准

Method: 开发包含1,500个问题的MatCha基准测试，涵盖材料研究的4个关键阶段和21个不同任务，反映材料科学家面临的真实挑战

Result: 最先进的多模态大语言模型在MatCha上表现显著低于人类专家，在处理需要高级专业知识和复杂视觉感知的问题时性能下降，简单的few-shot和思维链提示无法有效缓解这些限制

Abstract: Materials characterization is fundamental to acquiring materials information,
revealing the processing-microstructure-property relationships that guide
material design and optimization. While multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) have recently shown promise in generative and predictive tasks within
materials science, their capacity to understand real-world characterization
imaging data remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present MatCha, the
first benchmark for materials characterization image understanding, comprising
1,500 questions that demand expert-level domain expertise. MatCha encompasses
four key stages of materials research comprising 21 distinct tasks, each
designed to reflect authentic challenges faced by materials scientists. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on MatCha reveals a significant
performance gap compared to human experts. These models exhibit degradation
when addressing questions requiring higher-level expertise and sophisticated
visual perception. Simple few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting struggle to
alleviate these limitations. These findings highlight that existing MLLMs still
exhibit limited adaptability to real-world materials characterization
scenarios. We hope MatCha will facilitate future research in areas such as new
material discovery and autonomous scientific agents. MatCha is available at

Motivation: 当前医学影像的上下文学习模型无法同时实现高保真预测和全局解剖理解，且缺乏跨任务和跨解剖区域的统一模型，限制了上下文学习在医学影像中的潜力。

Method: 采用next-scale自回归上下文学习框架，从粗到细渐进式细化预测；提出块状交叉注意力模块，在保持计算效率的同时促进上下文与目标输入的长程交互。

Conclusion: Medverse展示了在3D医学影像中实现通用上下文学习的可行性，为医学影像分析提供了统一的解决方案，代码和模型权重将公开。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) offers a promising paradigm for universal medical
image analysis, enabling models to perform diverse image processing tasks
without retraining. However, current ICL models for medical imaging remain
limited in two critical aspects: they cannot simultaneously achieve
high-fidelity predictions and global anatomical understanding, and there is no
unified model trained across diverse medical imaging tasks (e.g., segmentation
and enhancement) and anatomical regions. As a result, the full potential of ICL
in medical imaging remains underexplored. Thus, we present \textbf{Medverse}, a
universal ICL model for 3D medical imaging, trained on 22 datasets covering
diverse tasks in universal image segmentation, transformation, and enhancement
across multiple organs, imaging modalities, and clinical centers. Medverse
employs a next-scale autoregressive in-context learning framework that
progressively refines predictions from coarse to fine, generating consistent,
full-resolution volumetric outputs and enabling multi-scale anatomical
awareness. We further propose a blockwise cross-attention module that
facilitates long-range interactions between context and target inputs while
preserving computational efficiency through spatial sparsity. Medverse is
extensively evaluated on a broad collection of held-out datasets covering
previously unseen clinical centers, organs, species, and imaging modalities.
Results demonstrate that Medverse substantially outperforms existing ICL
baselines and establishes a novel paradigm for in-context learning. Code and
model weights will be made publicly available. Our model are publicly available

Abstract: The advancement of open-source text-to-image (T2I) models has been hindered
by the absence of large-scale, reasoning-focused datasets and comprehensive
evaluation benchmarks, resulting in a performance gap compared to leading
closed-source systems. To address this challenge, We introduce FLUX-Reason-6M
and PRISM-Bench (Precise and Robust Image Synthesis Measurement Benchmark).
FLUX-Reason-6M is a massive dataset consisting of 6 million high-quality
FLUX-generated images and 20 million bilingual (English and Chinese)
descriptions specifically designed to teach complex reasoning. The image are
organized according to six key characteristics: Imagination, Entity, Text
rendering, Style, Affection, and Composition, and design explicit Generation
Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) to provide detailed breakdowns of image generation
steps. The whole data curation takes 15,000 A100 GPU days, providing the
community with a resource previously unattainable outside of large industrial
labs. PRISM-Bench offers a novel evaluation standard with seven distinct
tracks, including a formidable Long Text challenge using GCoT. Through
carefully designed prompts, it utilizes advanced vision-language models for
nuanced human-aligned assessment of prompt-image alignment and image
aesthetics. Our extensive evaluation of 19 leading models on PRISM-Bench
reveals critical performance gaps and highlights specific areas requiring
improvement. Our dataset, benchmark, and evaluation code are released to
catalyze the next wave of reasoning-oriented T2I generation. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胃病早期诊断至关重要，但传统组织病理学检查完全依赖人工，存在劳动强度大、病理学家间变异性高、关键发现可能遗漏等问题，需要自动化、可靠且高效的胃组织分析方法。

Conclusion: CoAtNeXt是胃组织图像组织病理学分类的稳健架构，在二分类和多分类任务上均表现优异，具有辅助病理学家提高诊断准确性和减少工作量的潜力。

Abstract: Background and objective Early diagnosis of gastric diseases is crucial to
prevent fatal outcomes. Although histopathologic examination remains the
diagnostic gold standard, it is performed entirely manually, making evaluations
labor-intensive and prone to variability among pathologists. Critical findings
may be missed, and lack of standard procedures reduces consistency. These
limitations highlight the need for automated, reliable, and efficient methods
for gastric tissue analysis. Methods In this study, a novel hybrid model named
CoAtNeXt was proposed for the classification of gastric tissue images. The
model is built upon the CoAtNet architecture by replacing its MBConv layers
with enhanced ConvNeXtV2 blocks. Additionally, the Convolutional Block
Attention Module (CBAM) is integrated to improve local feature extraction
through channel and spatial attention mechanisms. The architecture was scaled
to achieve a balance between computational efficiency and classification
performance. CoAtNeXt was evaluated on two publicly available datasets,
HMU-GC-HE-30K for eight-class classification and GasHisSDB for binary
classification, and was compared against 10 Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) and ten Vision Transformer (ViT) models. Results CoAtNeXt achieved
96.47% accuracy, 96.60% precision, 96.47% recall, 96.45% F1 score, and 99.89%
AUC on HMU-GC-HE-30K. On GasHisSDB, it reached 98.29% accuracy, 98.07%
precision, 98.41% recall, 98.23% F1 score, and 99.90% AUC. It outperformed all
CNN and ViT models tested and surpassed previous studies in the literature.
Conclusion Experimental results show that CoAtNeXt is a robust architecture for
histopathological classification of gastric tissue images, providing
performance on binary and multiclass. Its highlights its potential to assist
pathologists by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing workload.

Conclusion: MMOral数据集和OralGPT模型为智能牙科发展提供了重要基础，有望推动牙科领域多模态AI系统的临床应用

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
strong performance on general-purpose medical tasks. However, their
effectiveness in specialized domains such as dentistry remains underexplored.
In particular, panoramic X-rays, a widely used imaging modality in oral
radiology, pose interpretative challenges due to dense anatomical structures
and subtle pathological cues, which are not captured by existing medical
benchmarks or instruction datasets. To this end, we introduce MMOral, the first
large-scale multimodal instruction dataset and benchmark tailored for panoramic
X-ray interpretation. MMOral consists of 20,563 annotated images paired with
1.3 million instruction-following instances across diverse task types,
including attribute extraction, report generation, visual question answering,
and image-grounded dialogue. In addition, we present MMOral-Bench, a
comprehensive evaluation suite covering five key diagnostic dimensions in
dentistry. We evaluate 64 LVLMs on MMOral-Bench and find that even the
best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, only achieves 41.45% accuracy, revealing
significant limitations of current models in this domain. To promote the
progress of this specific domain, we also propose OralGPT, which conducts
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) upon Qwen2.5-VL-7B with our meticulously curated
MMOral instruction dataset. Remarkably, a single epoch of SFT yields
substantial performance enhancements for LVLMs, e.g., OralGPT demonstrates a
24.73% improvement. Both MMOral and OralGPT hold significant potential as a
critical foundation for intelligent dentistry and enable more clinically
impactful multimodal AI systems in the dental field. The dataset, model,
benchmark, and evaluation suite are available at

Conclusion: DATE方法通过显式的时间建模和语义引导的采样策略，有效解决了长视频理解中的时序推理挑战，为多模态大语言模型的长视频处理提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Long video understanding remains a fundamental challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), particularly in tasks requiring precise temporal
reasoning and event localization. Existing approaches typically adopt uniform
frame sampling and rely on implicit position encodings to model temporal order.
However, these methods struggle with long-range dependencies, leading to
critical information loss and degraded temporal comprehension. In this paper,
we propose Dynamic Absolute Time Enhancement (DATE) that enhances temporal
awareness in MLLMs through the Timestamp Injection Mechanism (TIM) and a
semantically guided Temporal-Aware Similarity Sampling (TASS) strategy.
Specifically, we interleave video frame embeddings with textual timestamp
tokens to construct a continuous temporal reference system. We further
reformulate the video sampling problem as a vision-language retrieval task and
introduce a two-stage algorithm to ensure both semantic relevance and temporal
coverage: enriching each query into a descriptive caption to better align with
the vision feature, and sampling key event with a similarity-driven temporally
regularized greedy strategy. Our method achieves remarkable improvements w.r.t.
absolute time understanding and key event localization, resulting in
state-of-the-art performance among 7B and 72B models on hour-long video
benchmarks. Particularly, our 7B model even exceeds many 72B models on some
benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决3D医学图像分割中资源消耗大、时间长的限制，以及现有静态模型难以在不同任务间平衡性能与效率的问题。

Method: 从冗余模型开始，通过块级剪枝和功能解耦损失迭代剪枝冗余模块，实现动态高效的3D分割。

Result: 轻量级变体PSP-Seg-S在五个数据集上与nnU-Net性能相当，GPU内存使用减少42-45%，训练时间减少29-48%，参数量减少83-87%。

Conclusion: PSP-Seg具有作为成本效益高且高性能的替代方案在临床中广泛应用的潜力。

Abstract: 3D medical image segmentation often faces heavy resource and time
consumption, limiting its scalability and rapid deployment in clinical
environments. Existing efficient segmentation models are typically static and
manually designed prior to training, which restricts their adaptability across
diverse tasks and makes it difficult to balance performance with resource
efficiency. In this paper, we propose PSP-Seg, a progressive pruning framework
that enables dynamic and efficient 3D segmentation. PSP-Seg begins with a
redundant model and iteratively prunes redundant modules through a combination
of block-wise pruning and a functional decoupling loss. We evaluate PSP-Seg on
five public datasets, benchmarking it against seven state-of-the-art models and
six efficient segmentation models. Results demonstrate that the lightweight
variant, PSP-Seg-S, achieves performance on par with nnU-Net while reducing GPU
memory usage by 42-45%, training time by 29-48%, and parameter number by 83-87%
across all datasets. These findings underscore PSP-Seg's potential as a
cost-effective yet high-performing alternative for widespread clinical
application.

Abstract: Chart understanding presents a critical test to the reasoning capabilities of
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior approaches face critical limitations: some
rely on external tools, making them brittle and constrained by a predefined
toolkit, while others fine-tune specialist models that often adopt a single
reasoning strategy, such as text-based chain-of-thought (CoT). The intermediate
steps of text-based reasoning are difficult to verify, which complicates the
use of reinforcement-learning signals that reward factual accuracy. To address
this, we propose a Code-as-Thought (CaT) approach to represent the visual
information of a chart in a verifiable, symbolic format. Our key insight is
that this strategy must be adaptive: a fixed, code-only implementation
consistently fails on complex charts where symbolic representation is
unsuitable. This finding leads us to introduce Visual Programmability: a
learnable property that determines if a chart-question pair is better solved
with code or direct visual analysis. We implement this concept in an adaptive
framework where a VLM learns to choose between the CaT pathway and a direct
visual reasoning pathway. The selection policy of the model is trained with
reinforcement learning using a novel dual-reward system. This system combines a
data-accuracy reward to ground the model in facts and prevent numerical
hallucination, with a decision reward that teaches the model when to use each
strategy, preventing it from defaulting to a single reasoning mode. Experiments
demonstrate strong and robust performance across diverse chart-understanding
benchmarks. Our work shows that VLMs can be taught not only to reason but also
how to reason, dynamically selecting the optimal reasoning pathway for each
task.

Abstract: Segmentation models are important tools for the detection and analysis of
lesions in brain MRI. Depending on the type of brain pathology that is imaged,
MRI scanners can acquire multiple, different image modalities (contrasts). Most
segmentation models for multimodal brain MRI are restricted to fixed modalities
and cannot effectively process new ones at inference. Some models generalize to
unseen modalities but may lose discriminative modality-specific information.
This work aims to develop a model that can perform inference on data that
contain image modalities unseen during training, previously seen modalities,
and heterogeneous combinations of both, thus allowing a user to utilize any
available imaging modalities. We demonstrate this is possible with a simple,
thus practical alteration to the U-net architecture, by integrating a
modality-agnostic input channel or pathway, alongside modality-specific input
channels. To train this modality-agnostic component, we develop an image
augmentation scheme that synthesizes artificial MRI modalities. Augmentations
differentially alter the appearance of pathological and healthy brain tissue to
create artificial contrasts between them while maintaining realistic anatomical
integrity. We evaluate the method using 8 MRI databases that include 5 types of
pathologies (stroke, tumours, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis and
white matter hyperintensities) and 8 modalities (T1, T1+contrast, T2, PD, SWI,
DWI, ADC and FLAIR). The results demonstrate that the approach preserves the
ability to effectively process MRI modalities encountered during training,
while being able to process new, unseen modalities to improve its segmentation.

Motivation: 传统闭集检测器在域假移和飞行数据损坏情况下性能显著降低，对于安全关键的UAV自主空中对象检测构成风险

Method: 通过嵌入空间中的熵正模型估计语义不确定性，结合谱标准化和温度缩放来增强开集医别能力，并包含背景拒绝机制来提升稳健性

Result: 在AOT空中标准数据集和实际飞行测试中，方法正在基准方法上实现了一致改进，相比标准YOLO检测器获得了较高达10%的相对AUROC提升

Conclusion: 该方法在不缩减检测准确性的前提下显著提升了开集检测的稳健性，特别适合动态空中对空环境中的可靠UAV感知应用

Abstract: Open-set detection is crucial for robust UAV autonomy in air-to-air object
detection under real-world conditions. Traditional closed-set detectors degrade
significantly under domain shifts and flight data corruption, posing risks to
safety-critical applications. We propose a novel, model-agnostic open-set
detection framework designed specifically for embedding-based detectors. The
method explicitly handles unknown object rejection while maintaining robustness
against corrupted flight data. It estimates semantic uncertainty via entropy
modeling in the embedding space and incorporates spectral normalization and
temperature scaling to enhance open-set discrimination. We validate our
approach on the challenging AOT aerial benchmark and through extensive
real-world flight tests. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate consistent
improvements over baseline methods, achieving up to a 10\% relative AUROC gain
compared to standard YOLO-based detectors. Additionally, we show that
background rejection further strengthens robustness without compromising
detection accuracy, making our solution particularly well-suited for reliable
UAV perception in dynamic air-to-air environments.

TL;DR: SlotSAR是一个新的目标中心学习框架，通过多级特征提取和注意力机制，在没有掩码标注的情况下从SAR图像中分离目标表示和背景杂波。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR图像中的复杂背景杂波（包括地形反射和斑点噪声）经常表现出与目标相似的强度和模式，导致模型提取纠缠或虚假特征，影响目标表示的清晰度。

Method: 首先从SARATR-X提取高级语义特征，从小波散射网络提取低级散射特征，获得互补的多级表示；然后提出多级槽注意力模块整合这些特征，增强槽表示的区分性。

Result: 实验结果表明，SlotSAR在SAR图像中实现了最先进的性能，相比现有OCL方法更好地保留了结构细节。

Conclusion: SlotSAR框架有效解决了SAR图像中目标与背景杂波分离的挑战，无需掩码标注就能获得清晰的目标表示。

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images contain not only targets of interest
but also complex background clutter, including terrain reflections and speckle
noise. In many cases, such clutter exhibits intensity and patterns that
resemble targets, leading models to extract entangled or spurious features.
Such behavior undermines the ability to form clear target representations,
regardless of the classifier. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
object-centric learning (OCL) framework, named SlotSAR, that disentangles
target representations from background clutter in SAR images without mask
annotations. SlotSAR first extracts high-level semantic features from SARATR-X
and low-level scattering features from the wavelet scattering network in order
to obtain complementary multi-level representations for robust target
characterization. We further present a multi-level slot attention module that
integrates these low- and high-level features to enhance slot-wise
representation distinctiveness, enabling effective OCL. Experimental results
demonstrate that SlotSAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in SAR imagery
by preserving structural details compared to existing OCL methods.

Motivation: 解决现实世界中不同车辆模型异构性带来的协作感知挑战，避免传统方法需要联合训练或预先存储所有可能合作者模型的不实用性

Method: 提出渐进式异构协作感知(PHCP)框架，将问题表述为少样本无监督域适应，在推理过程中通过自训练适配器动态对齐特征

Result: 在OPV2V数据集上的广泛实验表明，PHCP在各种异构场景下都取得了强劲性能，仅使用少量未标注数据就能达到与在全数据集上训练的SOTA方法相当的性能

Conclusion: PHCP成功证明了在推理过程中直接处理异构协作感知问题的可行性，无需联合训练或预先存储模型，为实际应用提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Collaborative perception enables vehicles to overcome individual perception
limitations by sharing information, allowing them to see further and through
occlusions. In real-world scenarios, models on different vehicles are often
heterogeneous due to manufacturer variations. Existing methods for
heterogeneous collaborative perception address this challenge by fine-tuning
adapters or the entire network to bridge the domain gap. However, these methods
are impractical in real-world applications, as each new collaborator must
undergo joint training with the ego vehicle on a dataset before inference, or
the ego vehicle stores models for all potential collaborators in advance.
Therefore, we pose a new question: Can we tackle this challenge directly during
inference, eliminating the need for joint training? To answer this, we
introduce Progressive Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception (PHCP), a novel
framework that formulates the problem as few-shot unsupervised domain
adaptation. Unlike previous work, PHCP dynamically aligns features by
self-training an adapter during inference, eliminating the need for labeled
data and joint training. Extensive experiments on the OPV2V dataset demonstrate
that PHCP achieves strong performance across diverse heterogeneous scenarios.
Notably, PHCP achieves performance comparable to SOTA methods trained on the
entire dataset while using only a small amount of unlabeled data.

Conclusion: 语言和视觉在图像识别中具有互补性，通过简单的融合策略可以有效利用这种互补性来提高分类准确性

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled strong zero-shot classification
through image-text alignment. Yet, their purely visual inference capabilities
remain under-explored. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
both language-guided and vision-only image classification with a diverse set of
dual-encoder VLMs, including both well-established and recent models such as
SigLIP 2 and RADIOv2.5. The performance is compared in a standard setup on the
ImageNet-1k validation set and its label-corrected variant. The key factors
affecting accuracy are analysed, including prompt design, class diversity, the
number of neighbours in k-NN, and reference set size. We show that language and
vision offer complementary strengths, with some classes favouring textual
prompts and others better handled by visual similarity. To exploit this
complementarity, we introduce a simple, learning-free fusion method based on
per-class precision that improves classification performance. The code is

Motivation: 手术技能评估（SSA）面临标注数据稀缺的挑战，少样本学习提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，但预训练策略在SSA中尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 将SSA构建为少样本任务，评估不同自监督预训练源在三个少样本设置下的表现，分析领域差距和手术特定数据对迁移性的影响。

Result: 领域相关的小数据集表现优于大规模不匹配数据集，在1-shot、2-shot和5-shot设置下分别达到60.16%、66.03%和73.65%的准确率。加入手术特定数据可平均提升1.22%准确率和2.28% F1分数。

Conclusion: 预训练数据的领域相关性比规模更重要，适当整合手术特定数据能显著提升少样本SSA性能，但需要谨慎选择预训练源以避免性能下降。

Abstract: Automated surgical skill assessment (SSA) is a central task in surgical
computer vision. Developing robust SSA models is challenging due to the
scarcity of skill annotations, which are time-consuming to produce and require
expert consensus. Few-shot learning (FSL) offers a scalable alternative
enabling model development with minimal supervision, though its success
critically depends on effective pre-training. While widely studied for several
surgical downstream tasks, pre-training has remained largely unexplored in SSA.
In this work, we formulate SSA as a few-shot task and investigate how
self-supervised pre-training strategies affect downstream few-shot SSA
performance. We annotate a publicly available robotic surgery dataset with
Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill (OSATS) scores, and evaluate
various pre-training sources across three few-shot settings. We quantify domain
similarity and analyze how domain gap and the inclusion of procedure-specific
data into pre-training influence transferability. Our results show that small
but domain-relevant datasets can outperform large scale, less aligned ones,
achieving accuracies of 60.16%, 66.03%, and 73.65% in the 1-, 2-, and 5-shot
settings, respectively. Moreover, incorporating procedure-specific data into
pre-training with a domain-relevant external dataset significantly boosts
downstream performance, with an average gain of +1.22% in accuracy and +2.28%
in F1-score; however, applying the same strategy with less similar but
large-scale sources can instead lead to performance degradation. Code and
models are available at https://github.com/anastadimi/ssa-fsl.

Abstract: Road traffic accidents remain a significant global concern, with human error,
particularly distracted and impaired driving, among the leading causes. This
study introduces a novel driver behavior classification system that uses
external observation techniques to detect indicators of distraction and
impairment. The proposed framework employs advanced computer vision
methodologies, including real-time object tracking, lateral displacement
analysis, and lane position monitoring. The system identifies unsafe driving
behaviors such as excessive lateral movement and erratic trajectory patterns by
implementing the YOLO object detection model and custom lane estimation
algorithms. Unlike systems reliant on inter-vehicular communication, this
vision-based approach enables behavioral analysis of non-connected vehicles.
Experimental evaluations on diverse video datasets demonstrate the framework's
reliability and adaptability across varying road and environmental conditions.

Abstract: This paper aims to recover the intrinsic reflectance layer and shading layer
given a single image. Though this intrinsic image decomposition problem has
been studied for decades, it remains a significant challenge in cases of
complex scenes, i.e. spatially-varying lighting effect and rich textures. In
this paper, we propose a novel method for handling severe lighting and rich
textures in intrinsic image decomposition, which enables to produce
high-quality intrinsic images for real-world images. Specifically, we observe
that previous learning-based methods tend to produce texture-less and
over-smoothing intrinsic images, which can be used to infer the lighting and
texture information given a RGB image. In this way, we design a texture-guided
regularization term and formulate the decomposition problem into an
optimization framework, to separate the material textures and lighting effect.
We demonstrate that combining the novel texture-aware prior can produce
superior results to existing approaches.

Result: 在单像素成像任务中实验结果显示，方法实现了更好的重建质量

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架能够在不打断模糊采样轨迹的前提下，通过混合数据一致性模块提高测量一致性，为逆问题解决提供了一种原理性方法

Abstract: We explore the connection between Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods and Denoising
Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for solving ill-posed inverse problems, with a
focus on single-pixel imaging. We begin by identifying key distinctions between
PnP and diffusion models-particularly in their denoising mechanisms and
sampling procedures. By decoupling the diffusion process into three
interpretable stages: denoising, data consistency enforcement, and sampling, we
provide a unified framework that integrates learned priors with physical
forward models in a principled manner. Building upon this insight, we propose a
hybrid data-consistency module that linearly combines multiple PnP-style
fidelity terms. This hybrid correction is applied directly to the denoised
estimate, improving measurement consistency without disrupting the diffusion
sampling trajectory. Experimental results on single-pixel imaging tasks
demonstrate that our method achieves better reconstruction quality.

Motivation: 脱内压升高对大脑功能构成严重威胁，虽然腰穿是金标准测量方法，但其侵入性和风险驱动了对无创备选方案的需求。视神经镜甲直径作为有前途的生物标记物，但现有手工测量方法存在不一致性、主观性和变异性问题。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在验证集上达到了$0.845 \pm 0.071$的准确度（五折交叉验证标准差），在独立测试集上达到0.786的准确度，显著超过传统的阈值基准方法（验证准确度$0.637 \pm 0.111$，测试准确度0.429）。

Conclusion: 通过有效减少操作员变异性和融合多源信息，该框架为临床ICP评估建立了可靠的无创方法，有望改善急性神经系统疾病患者的管理水平。

Abstract: Intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation poses severe threats to cerebral
function, thus necessitating monitoring for timely intervention. While lumbar
puncture is the gold standard for ICP measurement, its invasiveness and
associated risks drive the need for non-invasive alternatives. Optic nerve
sheath diameter (ONSD) has emerged as a promising biomarker, as elevated ICP
directly correlates with increased ONSD. However, current clinical practices
for ONSD measurement suffer from inconsistency in manual operation,
subjectivity in optimal view selection, and variability in thresholding,
limiting their reliability. To address these challenges, we introduce a fully
automatic two-stage framework for ICP grading, integrating keyframe
identification, ONSD measurement and clinical data. Specifically, the fundus
ultrasound video processing stage performs frame-level anatomical segmentation,
rule-based keyframe identification guided by an international consensus
statement, and precise ONSD measurement. The intracranial pressure grading
stage then fuses ONSD metrics with clinical features to enable the prediction
of ICP grades, thereby demonstrating an innovative blend of interpretable
ultrasound analysis and multi-source data integration for objective clinical
evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a
validation accuracy of $0.845 \pm 0.071$ (with standard deviation from
five-fold cross-validation) and an independent test accuracy of 0.786,
significantly outperforming conventional threshold-based method ($0.637 \pm
0.111$ validation accuracy, $0.429$ test accuracy). Through effectively
reducing operator variability and integrating multi-source information, our
framework establishes a reliable non-invasive approach for clinical ICP
evaluation, holding promise for improving patient management in acute
neurological conditions.

Conclusion: 该无监督框架能够有效分割IC缺陷，充分利用图像中的正常模式信息，免去了对外部正常集的依赖，在多种制造步骤都表现出良好的性能和稳健性

Abstract: Modern Integrated-Circuit(IC) manufacturing introduces diverse, fine-grained
defects that depress yield and reliability. Most industrial defect segmentation
compares a test image against an external normal set, a strategy that is
brittle for IC imagery where layouts vary across products and accurate
alignment is difficult. We observe that defects are predominantly local, while
each image still contains rich, repeatable normal patterns. We therefore
propose an unsupervised IC defect segmentation framework that requires no
external normal support. A learnable normal-information extractor aggregates
representative normal features from the test image, and a coherence loss
enforces their association with normal regions. Guided by these features, a
decoder reconstructs only normal content; the reconstruction residual then
segments defects. Pseudo-anomaly augmentation further stabilizes training.
Experiments on datasets from three IC process stages show consistent
improvements over existing approaches and strong robustness to product
variability.

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise for clinical decision
support, yet their reliability under distribution shifts remains a major
concern for safe deployment. These models often learn task-agnostic
correlations due to variability in imaging protocols and free-text reports,
limiting their generalizability and increasing the risk of failure in
real-world settings. We propose DRiFt, a structured feature decoupling
framework that explicitly separates clinically relevant signals from
task-agnostic noise using parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA) and learnable
prompt tokens. To enhance cross-modal alignment and reduce uncertainty, we
curate high-quality, clinically grounded image-text pairs by generating
captions for a diverse medical dataset. Our approach improves in-distribution
performance by +11.4% Top-1 accuracy and +3.3% Macro-F1 over prior prompt-based
methods, while maintaining strong robustness across unseen datasets. Ablation
studies reveal that disentangling task-relevant features and careful alignment
significantly enhance model generalization and reduce unpredictable behavior
under domain shift. These insights contribute toward building safer, more
trustworthy VLMs for clinical use. The code is available at

Abstract: As an influential information fusion and low-level vision technique, image
fusion integrates complementary information from source images to yield an
informative fused image. A few attempts have been made in recent years to
jointly realize image fusion and super-resolution. However, in real-world
applications such as military reconnaissance and long-range detection missions,
the target and background structures in multimodal images are easily corrupted,
with low resolution and weak semantic information, which leads to suboptimal
results in current fusion techniques. In response, we propose FS-Diff, a
semantic guidance and clarity-aware joint image fusion and super-resolution
method. FS-Diff unifies image fusion and super-resolution as a conditional
generation problem. It leverages semantic guidance from the proposed clarity
sensing mechanism for adaptive low-resolution perception and cross-modal
feature extraction. Specifically, we initialize the desired fused result as
pure Gaussian noise and introduce the bidirectional feature Mamba to extract
the global features of the multimodal images. Moreover, utilizing the source
images and semantics as conditions, we implement a random iterative denoising
process via a modified U-Net network. This network istrained for denoising at
multiple noise levels to produce high-resolution fusion results with
cross-modal features and abundant semantic information. We also construct a
powerful aerial view multiscene (AVMS) benchmark covering 600 pairs of images.
Extensive joint image fusion and super-resolution experiments on six public and
our AVMS datasets demonstrated that FS-Diff outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods at multiple magnifications and can recover richer details and semantics
in the fused images. The code is available at

Abstract: Recent advances in image-level self-supervised learning (SSL) have made
significant progress, yet learning dense representations for patches remains
challenging. Mainstream methods encounter an over-dispersion phenomenon that
patches from the same instance/category scatter, harming downstream performance
on dense tasks. This work reveals that image-level SSL avoids over-dispersion
by involving implicit semantic concentration. Specifically, the non-strict
spatial alignment ensures intra-instance consistency, while shared patterns,
i.e., similar parts of within-class instances in the input space, ensure
inter-image consistency. Unfortunately, these approaches are infeasible for
dense SSL due to their spatial sensitivity and complicated scene-centric data.
These observations motivate us to explore explicit semantic concentration for
dense SSL. First, to break the strict spatial alignment, we propose to distill
the patch correspondences. Facing noisy and imbalanced pseudo labels, we
propose a noise-tolerant ranking loss. The core idea is extending the Average
Precision (AP) loss to continuous targets, such that its decision-agnostic and
adaptive focusing properties prevent the student model from being misled.
Second, to discriminate the shared patterns from complicated scenes, we propose
the object-aware filter to map the output space to an object-based space.
Specifically, patches are represented by learnable prototypes of objects via
cross-attention. Last but not least, empirical studies across various tasks
soundly support the effectiveness of our method. Code is available in

TL;DR: FlexiD-Fuse是一个基于扩散模型的医学图像融合网络，能够处理任意数量的输入模态，解决了现有方法只能处理固定数量模态输入的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像融合方法只能处理固定数量的模态输入（如双模态或三模态），无法直接处理变化数量的输入，这限制了其在临床环境中的应用。

Method: 将扩散融合问题转化为基于扩散过程和分层贝叶斯建模的最大似然估计问题，通过将期望最大化算法整合到扩散采样迭代过程中，实现任意数量输入图像的高质量融合。

Result: 在哈佛数据集上的实验表明，该方法在变化输入数量的医学图像融合中取得了最佳性能，同时在红外-可见光、多曝光和多焦点图像融合任务中也表现出优越性。

Conclusion: FlexiD-Fuse方法能够有效处理任意数量的输入模态，在医学图像融合和其他多模态图像融合任务中均表现出卓越的性能和通用性。

Abstract: Different modalities of medical images provide unique physiological and
anatomical information for diseases. Multi-modal medical image fusion
integrates useful information from different complementary medical images with
different modalities, producing a fused image that comprehensively and
objectively reflects lesion characteristics to assist doctors in clinical
diagnosis. However, existing fusion methods can only handle a fixed number of
modality inputs, such as accepting only two-modal or tri-modal inputs, and
cannot directly process varying input quantities, which hinders their
application in clinical settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce
FlexiD-Fuse, a diffusion-based image fusion network designed to accommodate
flexible quantities of input modalities. It can end-to-end process two-modal
and tri-modal medical image fusion under the same weight. FlexiD-Fuse
transforms the diffusion fusion problem, which supports only fixed-condition
inputs, into a maximum likelihood estimation problem based on the diffusion
process and hierarchical Bayesian modeling. By incorporating the
Expectation-Maximization algorithm into the diffusion sampling iteration
process, FlexiD-Fuse can generate high-quality fused images with cross-modal
information from source images, independently of the number of input images. We
compared the latest two and tri-modal medical image fusion methods, tested them
on Harvard datasets, and evaluated them using nine popular metrics. The
experimental results show that our method achieves the best performance in
medical image fusion with varying inputs. Meanwhile, we conducted extensive
extension experiments on infrared-visible, multi-exposure, and multi-focus
image fusion tasks with arbitrary numbers, and compared them with the
perspective SOTA methods. The results of the extension experiments consistently
demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.

Motivation: 解决撒哈拉以南非洲地区高质量标注医学影像数据稀缺的问题，为资源受限的临床环境开发高效可部署的脑胶质瘤分割解决方案。

Method: 采用3D Attention UNet架构，结合残差块增强，利用BraTS 2021数据集进行预训练和迁移学习，在BraTS-Africa数据集上进行评估。

Result: 在95例MRI数据上获得Dice分数：增强肿瘤(ET)0.76、坏死和非增强肿瘤核心(NETC)0.80、周围非功能半球(SNFH)0.85，模型大小约90MB，单例推理时间低于1分钟。

Conclusion: 该模型在数据质量和数量有限的情况下表现出良好的泛化能力，具有在低资源医疗环境中部署的实用性，有助于推动全球健康公平AI的发展。

Abstract: Gliomas are the most prevalent type of primary brain tumors, and their
accurate segmentation from MRI is critical for diagnosis, treatment planning,
and longitudinal monitoring. However, the scarcity of high-quality annotated
imaging data in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) poses a significant challenge for
deploying advanced segmentation models in clinical workflows. This study
introduces a robust and computationally efficient deep learning framework
tailored for resource-constrained settings. We leveraged a 3D Attention UNet
architecture augmented with residual blocks and enhanced through transfer
learning from pre-trained weights on the BraTS 2021 dataset. Our model was
evaluated on 95 MRI cases from the BraTS-Africa dataset, a benchmark for glioma
segmentation in SSA MRI data. Despite the limited data quality and quantity,
our approach achieved Dice scores of 0.76 for the Enhancing Tumor (ET), 0.80
for Necrotic and Non-Enhancing Tumor Core (NETC), and 0.85 for Surrounding
Non-Functional Hemisphere (SNFH). These results demonstrate the
generalizability of the proposed model and its potential to support clinical
decision making in low-resource settings. The compact architecture,
approximately 90 MB, and sub-minute per-volume inference time on consumer-grade
hardware further underscore its practicality for deployment in SSA health
systems. This work contributes toward closing the gap in equitable AI for
global health by empowering underserved regions with high-performing and
accessible medical imaging solutions.

Abstract: Deepfakes, synthetic media created using advanced AI techniques, have
intensified the spread of misinformation, particularly in politically sensitive
contexts. Existing deepfake detection datasets are often limited, relying on
outdated generation methods, low realism, or single-face imagery, restricting
the effectiveness for general synthetic image detection. By analyzing social
media posts, we identify multiple modalities through which deepfakes propagate
misinformation. Furthermore, our human perception study demonstrates that
recently developed proprietary models produce synthetic images increasingly
indistinguishable from real ones, complicating accurate identification by the
general public. Consequently, we present a comprehensive, politically-focused
dataset specifically crafted for benchmarking detection against modern
generative models. This dataset contains three million real images paired with
descriptive captions, which are used for generating 963k corresponding
high-quality synthetic images from a mix of proprietary and open-source models.
Recognizing the continual evolution of generative techniques, we introduce an
innovative crowdsourced adversarial platform, where participants are
incentivized to generate and submit challenging synthetic images. This ongoing
community-driven initiative ensures that deepfake detection methods remain
robust and adaptive, proactively safeguarding public discourse from
sophisticated misinformation threats.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将人体运动分解为局部关节运动和全局根关节运动分别处理，但这两部分在物理上相互耦合。传统方法难以精确捕捉这种物理关联，而基于关节扭矩和外部力的方法计算复杂昂贵

Method: 使用全身线性和角动量作为约束来连接局部运动与全局运动，引入新的损失函数来强制生成的运动动量分布与真实数据保持一致

Result: 该方法减少了脚部滑动和抖动，改善了平衡性，同时保持了运动恢复的准确性

Conclusion: 动量约束提供了一种物理基础的方法来关联局部关节行为与全局位移，有效解决了运动生成中的物理一致性问题

Abstract: Many studies decompose human motion into local motion in a frame attached to
the root joint and global motion of the root joint in the world frame, treating
them separately. However, these two components are not independent. Global
movement arises from interactions with the environment, which are, in turn,
driven by changes in the body configuration. Motion models often fail to
precisely capture this physical coupling between local and global dynamics,
while deriving global trajectories from joint torques and external forces is
computationally expensive and complex. To address these challenges, we propose
using whole-body linear and angular momentum as a constraint to link local
motion with global movement. Since momentum reflects the aggregate effect of
joint-level dynamics on the body's movement through space, it provides a
physically grounded way to relate local joint behavior to global displacement.
Building on this insight, we introduce a new loss term that enforces
consistency between the generated momentum profiles and those observed in
ground-truth data. Incorporating our loss reduces foot sliding and jitter,
improves balance, and preserves the accuracy of the recovered motion. Code and
data are available at the project page https://hlinhn.github.io/momentum_bmvc.

Method: 将每张线条图分割成补丁集合，使用Transformer框架学习图像内和图像间的补丁级相似性，然后通过边缘感知聚类和区域匹配算法将补丁级预测转换为一致的区域级对应关系。

Result: 在多个数据集上达到了96.34%的高补丁级准确率，生成了一致的区域级对应关系。

Conclusion: 该方法为沪漫线条图像区域对应关系预测提供了有效解决方案，具有强大的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Understanding region-wise correspondence between manga line art images is a
fundamental task in manga processing, enabling downstream applications such as
automatic line art colorization and in-between frame generation. However, this
task remains largely unexplored, especially in realistic scenarios without
pre-existing segmentation or annotations. In this paper, we introduce a novel
and practical task: predicting region-wise correspondence between raw manga
line art images without any pre-existing labels or masks. To tackle this
problem, we divide each line art image into a set of patches and propose a
Transformer-based framework that learns patch-level similarities within and
across images. We then apply edge-aware clustering and a region matching
algorithm to convert patch-level predictions into coherent region-level
correspondences. To support training and evaluation, we develop an automatic
annotation pipeline and manually refine a subset of the data to construct
benchmark datasets. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our
method achieves high patch-level accuracy (e.g., 96.34%) and generates
consistent region-level correspondences, highlighting its potential for
real-world manga applications.

Motivation: 多视图聚类中存在低质量数据问题，主要源于某些视图被噪声污染或存在数据缺失，影响多视图融合效果和聚类性能

Method: 提出随机生成扩散融合(SGDF)方法，利用多重生成机制处理每个样本的多视图特征；基于SGDF构建生成扩散对比网络(GDCN)

Result: 大量实验表明GDCN在深度多视图聚类任务中取得了最先进的性能

Conclusion: SGDF方法能有效处理多视图聚类中的低质量数据问题，GDCN网络在MVC任务中表现出色

Abstract: In recent years, Multi-View Clustering (MVC) has been significantly advanced
under the influence of deep learning. By integrating heterogeneous data from
multiple views, MVC enhances clustering analysis, making multi-view fusion
critical to clustering performance. However, there is a problem of low-quality
data in multi-view fusion. This problem primarily arises from two reasons: 1)
Certain views are contaminated by noisy data. 2) Some views suffer from missing
data. This paper proposes a novel Stochastic Generative Diffusion Fusion (SGDF)
method to address this problem. SGDF leverages a multiple generative mechanism
for the multi-view feature of each sample. It is robust to low-quality data.
Building on SGDF, we further present the Generative Diffusion Contrastive
Network (GDCN). Extensive experiments show that GDCN achieves the
state-of-the-art results in deep MVC tasks. The source code is publicly
available at https://github.com/HackerHyper/GDCN.

Motivation: 传统3D超声系统成本高且复杂，而现有的传感器无关3D超声方法要么忽略全局特征，要么将其与局部特征提取紧密耦合，无法有效建模这两个互补方面。

Method: 提出DualTrack双编码器架构：局部编码器使用密集时空卷积捕获细粒度特征；全局编码器使用图像主干网络和时序注意力层嵌入高级解剖特征和长程依赖；轻量级融合模块结合特征进行轨迹估计。

Result: 在大型公共基准测试中达到最先进精度，平均重建误差低于5毫米，优于先前方法，实现了全局一致的3D重建。

Conclusion: DualTrack通过解耦的局部和全局特征提取方法，有效解决了传感器无关3D超声重建中的关键挑战，为低成本3D超声成像提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Three-dimensional ultrasound (US) offers many clinical advantages over
conventional 2D imaging, yet its widespread adoption is limited by the cost and
complexity of traditional 3D systems. Sensorless 3D US, which uses deep
learning to estimate a 3D probe trajectory from a sequence of 2D US images, is
a promising alternative. Local features, such as speckle patterns, can help
predict frame-to-frame motion, while global features, such as coarse shapes and
anatomical structures, can situate the scan relative to anatomy and help
predict its general shape. In prior approaches, global features are either
ignored or tightly coupled with local feature extraction, restricting the
ability to robustly model these two complementary aspects. We propose
DualTrack, a novel dual-encoder architecture that leverages decoupled local and
global encoders specialized for their respective scales of feature extraction.
The local encoder uses dense spatiotemporal convolutions to capture
fine-grained features, while the global encoder utilizes an image backbone
(e.g., a 2D CNN or foundation model) and temporal attention layers to embed
high-level anatomical features and long-range dependencies. A lightweight
fusion module then combines these features to estimate the trajectory.
Experimental results on a large public benchmark show that DualTrack achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and globally consistent 3D reconstructions,
outperforming previous methods and yielding an average reconstruction error
below 5 mm.

Conclusion: 特征对齐是提升视频扩散模型性能的有效方法，Align4Gen通过系统性的特征分析和融合对齐机制，显著改善了视频生成效果

Abstract: Video diffusion models have advanced rapidly in the recent years as a result
of series of architectural innovations (e.g., diffusion transformers) and use
of novel training objectives (e.g., flow matching). In contrast, less attention
has been paid to improving the feature representation power of such models. In
this work, we show that training video diffusion models can benefit from
aligning the intermediate features of the video generator with feature
representations of pre-trained vision encoders. We propose a new metric and
conduct an in-depth analysis of various vision encoders to evaluate their
discriminability and temporal consistency, thereby assessing their suitability
for video feature alignment. Based on the analysis, we present Align4Gen which
provides a novel multi-feature fusion and alignment method integrated into
video diffusion model training. We evaluate Align4Gen both for unconditional
and class-conditional video generation tasks and show that it results in
improved video generation as quantified by various metrics. Full video results

Abstract: While large-scale human motion capture datasets have advanced human motion
generation, modeling and generating dynamic 3D human-object interactions (HOIs)
remain challenging due to dataset limitations. Existing datasets often lack
extensive, high-quality motion and annotation and exhibit artifacts such as

annotations. Second, we propose a unified optimization framework to enhance
data quality by reducing artifacts and correcting hand motions. Leveraging the
principle of contact invariance, we maintain human-object relationships while
introducing motion variations, expanding the dataset to 30.70 hours. Third, we
define six benchmarking tasks and develop a unified HOI generative modeling
perspective, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Extensive experiments
validate the utility of our dataset as a foundational resource for advancing 3D

Motivation: 深度学习算法在MRI脑部影像诊断中可能存在捷径学习问题，即使用与输出标签无关的虚假特征进行预测。当这些特征与受保护属性（如种族和性别）相关时，会导致对代表性不足群体的性能偏见。

Method: 使用ResNet和SwinTransformer等深度学习模型，在多个数据集上进行实验：1）验证DL算法能否从3D脑部MRI识别种族或性别；2）研究训练集种族/性别不平衡是否导致性能下降；3）对受保护属性和AD分类任务进行定量和定性特征归因分析。

Result: 实验证明了基于深度学习的AD分类中存在种族和性别相关的捷径学习和偏见，DL算法确实能够从脑部MRI中识别种族和性别信息，训练集不平衡会导致模型性能下降。

Conclusion: 这项工作为开发更公平的脑部MRI深度学习诊断工具奠定了基础，揭示了当前算法中存在的偏见问题，需要进一步研究来消除这些不公平性。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard for brain imaging. Deep
learning (DL) algorithms have been proposed to aid in the diagnosis of diseases
such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) from MRI scans. However, DL algorithms can
suffer from shortcut learning, in which spurious features, not directly related
to the output label, are used for prediction. When these features are related
to protected attributes, they can lead to performance bias against
underrepresented protected groups, such as those defined by race and sex. In
this work, we explore the potential for shortcut learning and demographic bias
in DL based AD diagnosis from MRI. We first investigate if DL algorithms can
identify race or sex from 3D brain MRI scans to establish the presence or
otherwise of race and sex based distributional shifts. Next, we investigate
whether training set imbalance by race or sex can cause a drop in model
performance, indicating shortcut learning and bias. Finally, we conduct a
quantitative and qualitative analysis of feature attributions in different
brain regions for both the protected attribute and AD classification tasks.
Through these experiments, and using multiple datasets and DL models (ResNet
and SwinTransformer), we demonstrate the existence of both race and sex based
shortcut learning and bias in DL based AD classification. Our work lays the
foundation for fairer DL diagnostic tools in brain MRI. The code is provided at

Abstract: To tackle the prevalence of pseudo changes, the scarcity of labeled samples,
and the difficulty of cross-domain generalization in multi-temporal and
multi-source remote sensing imagery, we propose PeftCD, a change detection
framework built upon Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) with Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT). At its core, PeftCD employs a weight-sharing Siamese
encoder derived from a VFM, into which LoRA and Adapter modules are seamlessly
integrated. This design enables highly efficient task adaptation by training
only a minimal set of additional parameters. To fully unlock the potential of
VFMs, we investigate two leading backbones: the Segment Anything Model v2
(SAM2), renowned for its strong segmentation priors, and DINOv3, a
state-of-the-art self-supervised representation learner. The framework is
complemented by a deliberately lightweight decoder, ensuring the focus remains
on the powerful feature representations from the backbones. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PeftCD achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple public datasets, including SYSU-CD (IoU 73.81%), WHUCD
(92.05%), MSRSCD (64.07%), MLCD (76.89%), CDD (97.01%), S2Looking (52.25%) and
LEVIR-CD (85.62%), with notably precise boundary delineation and strong
suppression of pseudo-changes. In summary, PeftCD presents an optimal balance
of accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. It offers a powerful and scalable
paradigm for adapting large-scale VFMs to real-world remote sensing change
detection applications. The code and pretrained models will be released at
https://github.com/dyzy41/PeftCD.

Abstract: Event cameras capture changes in brightness with microsecond precision and
remain reliable under motion blur and challenging illumination, offering clear
advantages for modeling highly dynamic scenes. Yet, their integration with
natural language understanding has received little attention, leaving a gap in
multimodal perception. To address this, we introduce Talk2Event, the first
large-scale benchmark for language-driven object grounding using event data.
Built on real-world driving scenarios, Talk2Event comprises 5,567 scenes,
13,458 annotated objects, and more than 30,000 carefully validated referring
expressions. Each expression is enriched with four structured attributes --
appearance, status, relation to the viewer, and relation to surrounding objects
-- that explicitly capture spatial, temporal, and relational cues. This
attribute-centric design supports interpretable and compositional grounding,
enabling analysis that moves beyond simple object recognition to contextual
reasoning in dynamic environments. We envision Talk2Event as a foundation for
advancing multimodal and temporally-aware perception, with applications
spanning robotics, human-AI interaction, and so on.

Conclusion: Kling-Avatar为语义基础的高保真音频驱动虚拟人合成建立了新的基准，适用于数字人直播和视频博客等实际应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-driven avatar video generation have significantly
enhanced audio-visual realism. However, existing methods treat instruction
conditioning merely as low-level tracking driven by acoustic or visual cues,
without modeling the communicative purpose conveyed by the instructions. This
limitation compromises their narrative coherence and character expressiveness.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Kling-Avatar, a novel cascaded framework that
unifies multimodal instruction understanding with photorealistic portrait
generation. Our approach adopts a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we
design a multimodal large language model (MLLM) director that produces a
blueprint video conditioned on diverse instruction signals, thereby governing
high-level semantics such as character motion and emotions. In the second
stage, guided by blueprint keyframes, we generate multiple sub-clips in
parallel using a first-last frame strategy. This global-to-local framework
preserves fine-grained details while faithfully encoding the high-level intent
behind multimodal instructions. Our parallel architecture also enables fast and
stable generation of long-duration videos, making it suitable for real-world
applications such as digital human livestreaming and vlogging. To
comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a benchmark of 375 curated
samples covering diverse instructions and challenging scenarios. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Kling-Avatar is capable of generating vivid,
fluent, long-duration videos at up to 1080p and 48 fps, achieving superior
performance in lip synchronization accuracy, emotion and dynamic
expressiveness, instruction controllability, identity preservation, and
cross-domain generalization. These results establish Kling-Avatar as a new
benchmark for semantically grounded, high-fidelity audio-driven avatar
synthesis.

Abstract: Predicting the spatio-temporal progression of brain tumors is essential for
guiding clinical decisions in neuro-oncology. We propose a hybrid mechanistic
learning framework that combines a mathematical tumor growth model with a
guided denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) to synthesize anatomically
feasible future MRIs from preceding scans. The mechanistic model, formulated as
a system of ordinary differential equations, captures temporal tumor dynamics
including radiotherapy effects and estimates future tumor burden. These
estimates condition a gradient-guided DDIM, enabling image synthesis that
aligns with both predicted growth and patient anatomy. We train our model on
the BraTS adult and pediatric glioma datasets and evaluate on 60 axial slices
of in-house longitudinal pediatric diffuse midline glioma (DMG) cases. Our
framework generates realistic follow-up scans based on spatial similarity
metrics. It also introduces tumor growth probability maps, which capture both
clinically relevant extent and directionality of tumor growth as shown by 95th
percentile Hausdorff Distance. The method enables biologically informed image
generation in data-limited scenarios, offering generative-space-time
predictions that account for mechanistic priors.

Conclusion: HumbleBench填补了当前评估套件中的关键空白，通过显式错误选项拒绝机制，为安全关键环境中的MLLM可靠性提供了更现实的衡量标准

Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) -- where the model
generates content inconsistent with the input image -- pose significant risks
in real-world applications, from misinformation in visual question answering to
unsafe errors in decision-making. Existing benchmarks primarily test
recognition accuracy, i.e., evaluating whether models can select the correct
answer among distractors. This overlooks an equally critical capability for
trustworthy AI: recognizing when none of the provided options are correct, a
behavior reflecting epistemic humility. We present HumbleBench, a new
hallucination benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' ability to reject plausible
but incorrect answers across three hallucination types: object, relation, and
attribute. Built from a panoptic scene graph dataset, we leverage fine-grained
scene graph annotations to extract ground-truth entities and relations, and
prompt GPT-4-Turbo to generate multiple-choice questions, followed by a
rigorous manual filtering process. Each question includes a "None of the above"
option, requiring models not only to recognize correct visual information but
also to identify when no provided answer is valid. We evaluate a variety of
state-of-the-art MLLMs -- including both general-purpose and specialized
reasoning models -- on HumbleBench and share valuable findings and insights
with the community. By incorporating explicit false-option rejection,
HumbleBench fills a key gap in current evaluation suites, providing a more
realistic measure of MLLM reliability in safety-critical settings. Our code and
dataset are released publicly and can be accessed at

TL;DR: 本文提出了UAE框架，通过Auto-Encoder视角将图像理解作为编码器(I2T)，图像生成作为解码器(T2I)，使用重建保真度作为统一训练目标，实现双向信息流的统一多模态学习。

Motivation: 探索通过重建保真度作为统一训练目标，实现图像理解与生成之间的双向协同增益，推动统一多模态学习的发展。

Method: 提出UAE框架：1）使用大规模长上下文图像描述预训练解码器；2）提出Unified-GRPO强化学习方法，包含冷启动阶段、生成促进理解阶段、理解促进生成阶段的三阶段训练策略。

Conclusion: 通过重建驱动的统一训练范式，实现了理解与生成能力的相互促进，为多模态学习提供了新的insight和有效框架。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an insightful paradigm through the Auto-Encoder
lens-understanding as the encoder (I2T) that compresses images into text, and
generation as the decoder (T2I) that reconstructs images from that text. Using
reconstruction fidelity as the unified training objective, we enforce the
coherent bidirectional information flow between the understanding and
generation processes, bringing mutual gains. To implement this, we propose UAE,
a novel framework for unified multimodal learning. We begin by pre-training the
decoder with large-scale long-context image captions to capture fine-grained
semantic and complex spatial relationships. We then propose Unified-GRPO via
reinforcement learning (RL), which covers three stages: (1) A cold-start phase
to gently initialize both encoder and decoder with a semantic reconstruction
loss; (2) Generation for Understanding, where the encoder is trained to
generate informative captions that maximize the decoder's reconstruction
quality, enhancing its visual understanding; (3) Understanding for Generation,
where the decoder is refined to reconstruct from these captions, forcing it to
leverage every detail and improving its long-context instruction following and
generation fidelity. For evaluation, we introduce Unified-Bench, the first
benchmark tailored to assess the degree of unification of the UMMs. A
surprising "aha moment" arises within the multimodal learning domain: as RL
progresses, the encoder autonomously produces more descriptive captions, while
the decoder simultaneously demonstrates a profound ability to understand these
intricate descriptions, resulting in reconstructions of striking fidelity.

Abstract: We introduce Neural Riemannian Motion Fields (NRMF), a novel 3D generative
human motion prior that enables robust, temporally consistent, and physically
plausible 3D motion recovery. Unlike existing VAE or diffusion-based methods,
our higher-order motion prior explicitly models the human motion in the zero
level set of a collection of neural distance fields (NDFs) corresponding to
pose, transition (velocity), and acceleration dynamics. Our framework is
rigorous in the sense that our NDFs are constructed on the product space of
joint rotations, their angular velocities, and angular accelerations,
respecting the geometry of the underlying articulations. We further introduce:
(i) a novel adaptive-step hybrid algorithm for projecting onto the set of
plausible motions, and (ii) a novel geometric integrator to "roll out"
realistic motion trajectories during test-time-optimization and generation. Our
experiments show significant and consistent gains: trained on the AMASS
dataset, NRMF remarkably generalizes across multiple input modalities and to
diverse tasks ranging from denoising to motion in-betweening and fitting to
partial 2D / 3D observations.

Conclusion: 扩散模型中的局部性特征是图像数据集统计特性的体现，而非卷积网络架构的归纳偏置结果，这一发现为理解扩散模型行为提供了新视角

Abstract: Among generative models, diffusion models are uniquely intriguing due to the
existence of a closed-form optimal minimizer of their training objective, often
referred to as the optimal denoiser. However, diffusion using this optimal
denoiser merely reproduces images in the training set and hence fails to
capture the behavior of deep diffusion models. Recent work has attempted to
characterize this gap between the optimal denoiser and deep diffusion models,
proposing analytical, training-free models that can generate images that
resemble those generated by a trained UNet. The best-performing method
hypothesizes that shift equivariance and locality inductive biases of
convolutional neural networks are the cause of the performance gap, hence
incorporating these assumptions into its analytical model. In this work, we
present evidence that the locality in deep diffusion models emerges as a
statistical property of the image dataset, not due to the inductive bias of
convolutional neural networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that an optimal
parametric linear denoiser exhibits similar locality properties to the deep
neural denoisers. We further show, both theoretically and experimentally, that
this locality arises directly from the pixel correlations present in natural
image datasets. Finally, we use these insights to craft an analytical denoiser
that better matches scores predicted by a deep diffusion model than the prior
expert-crafted alternative.

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in spatial intelligence, spanning both
spatial reconstruction and world exploration. However, the scalability and
real-world fidelity of current models remain severely constrained by the
scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. While several datasets
provide camera pose information, they are typically limited in scale,
diversity, and annotation richness, particularly for real-world dynamic scenes
with ground-truth camera motion. To this end, we collect \textbf{SpatialVID}, a
dataset consists of a large corpus of in-the-wild videos with diverse scenes,
camera movements and dense 3D annotations such as per-frame camera poses,
depth, and motion instructions. Specifically, we collect more than 21,000 hours
of raw video, and process them into 2.7 million clips through a hierarchical
filtering pipeline, totaling 7,089 hours of dynamic content. A subsequent
annotation pipeline enriches these clips with detailed spatial and semantic
information, including camera poses, depth maps, dynamic masks, structured
captions, and serialized motion instructions. Analysis of SpatialVID's data
statistics reveals a richness and diversity that directly foster improved model
generalization and performance, establishing it as a key asset for the video
and 3D vision research community.
