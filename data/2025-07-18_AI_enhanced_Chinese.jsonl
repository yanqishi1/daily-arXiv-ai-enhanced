To address these\nchallenges, our key idea is to embed a new visual parameter space into a\npre-trained LLM, enabling stable learning of visual knowledge from noisy data\nvia delta tuning. Based on this principle, we first introduce Mono-InternVL, an\nadvanced monolithic MLLM that incorporates a set of visual experts through a\nmultimodal mixture-of-experts architecture. In addition, we design an\ninnovative Endogenous Visual Pre-training (EViP) for Mono-InternVL to maximize\nits visual capabilities via progressive learning. Mono-InternVL achieves\ncompetitive performance against existing MLLMs but also leads to relatively\nexpensive data cost. Therefore, we further present Mono-InternVL-1.5, a cheaper\nand stronger monolithic MLLM equipped with an improved EViP (EViP++). EViP++\nintroduces additional visual attention experts to Mono-InternVL-1.5 and\nre-organizes the pre-training process in an efficient manner. During inference,\nit includes a fused CUDA kernel to speed up its MoE operations. With these\ndesigns, Mono-InternVL-1.5 significantly reduces training and inference costs,\nwhile still maintaining competitive performance with Mono-InternVL. To evaluate\nour approach, we conduct extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks. Results\ndemonstrate that Mono-InternVL outperforms existing monolithic MLLMs on 12 out\nof 15 benchmarks, e.g., +114-point improvement over Emu3 on OCRBench. Compared\nto its modular counterpart, i.e., InternVL-1.5, Mono-InternVL-1.5 achieves\nsimilar multimodal performance while reducing first-token latency by up to 69%.\nCode and models are released at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/Mono-InternVL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09Mono-InternVL\u53ca\u5176\u6539\u8fdb\u7248Mono-InternVL-1.5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5d4c\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709MLLM\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u6a21\u6001MLLM\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u7801\u96c6\u6210\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMono-InternVL\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u5d4c\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5185\u6e90\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08EViP\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u4e3aMono-InternVL-1.5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e13\u5bb6\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff08EViP++\uff09\u3002", "result": "Mono-InternVL\u572815\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709MLLM\uff0cMono-InternVL-1.5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u9996\u8bcd\u5ef6\u8fdf\u51cf\u5c1169%\u3002", "conclusion": "Mono-InternVL\u53ca\u5176\u6539\u8fdb\u7248\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u53c2\u6570\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5355\u6a21\u6001MLLM\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Preprint", "summary": "Crop mapping involves identifying and classifying crop types using spatial\ndata, primarily derived from remote sensing imagery. This study presents the\nfirst comprehensive review of large-scale, pixel-wise crop mapping workflows,\nencompassing both conventional supervised methods and emerging transfer\nlearning approaches. To identify the optimal supervised crop mapping workflows,\nwe conducted systematic experiments, comparing six widely adopted satellite\nimage-based preprocessing methods, alongside eleven supervised pixel-wise\nclassification models. Additionally, we assessed the synergistic impact of\nvaried training sample sizes and variable combinations. Moreover, we identified\noptimal transfer learning techniques for different magnitudes of domain shift.\nThe evaluation of best methods was conducted across five diverse agricultural\nsites. Landsat 8 served as the primary satellite data source. Labels come from\nCDL trusted pixels and field surveys.\n  Our findings reveal three key insights. First, fine-scale interval\npreprocessing paired with Transformer models consistently delivered optimal\nperformance for both supervised and transferable workflows. RF offered rapid\ntraining and competitive performance in conventional supervised learning and\ndirect transfer to similar domains. Second, transfer learning techniques\nenhanced workflow adaptability, with UDA being effective for homogeneous crop\nclasses while fine-tuning remains robust across diverse scenarios.

In order to reliably accomplish these\ntasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e.,\nwhether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely\nnonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the\nability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,\n2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that\ndiscriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal\ndifference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have\naccess to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously\nreported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a\nconsistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,\nlayers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors\nidentified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human\ncategorization behavior. This potentially provides a novel view into how human\nparticipants distinguish between modal categories, which we explore by\ncorrelating projections along modal difference vectors with human participants'\nratings of interpretable features.

Since there\ncould be an exponential number of object-action combinations, labeled data is\nlimited - leading to a long-tail distribution problem. Recently, zero-shot\nlearning emerged as a solution, with end-to-end transformer-based object\ndetectors adapted for HOID becoming successful frameworks. However, their\nprimary focus is designing improved decoders for learning entangled or\ndisentangled interpretations of interactions. We advocate that HOI-specific\ncues must be anticipated at the encoder stage itself to obtain a stronger scene\ninterpretation. Consequently, we build a top-down framework named Funnel-HOI\ninspired by the human tendency to grasp well-defined concepts first and then\nassociate them with abstract concepts during scene understanding. We first\nprobe an image for the presence of objects (well-defined concepts) and then\nprobe for actions (abstract concepts) associated with them.

This paper presents FORTRESS\n(Function-composition Optimized Real-Time Resilient Structural Segmentation), a\nnew architecture that balances accuracy and speed by using a special method\nthat combines depthwise separable convolutions with adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold\nNetwork integration. FORTRESS incorporates three key innovations: a systematic\ndepthwise separable convolution framework achieving a 3.6x parameter reduction\nper layer, adaptive TiKAN integration that selectively applies function\ncomposition transformations only when computationally beneficial, and\nmulti-scale attention fusion combining spatial, channel, and KAN-enhanced\nfeatures across decoder levels. The architecture achieves remarkable efficiency\ngains with 91% parameter reduction (31M to 2.9M), 91% computational complexity\nreduction (13.7 to 1.17 GFLOPs), and 3x inference speed improvement while\ndelivering superior segmentation performance. Evaluation on benchmark\ninfrastructure datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art results with an F1- score\nof 0.771 and a mean IoU of 0.677, significantly outperforming existing methods\nincluding U-Net, SA-UNet, and U- KAN. The dual optimization strategy proves\nessential for optimal performance, establishing FORTRESS as a robust solution\nfor practical structural defect segmentation in resource-constrained\nenvironments where both accuracy and computational efficiency are paramount.\nComprehensive architectural specifications are provided in the Supplemental\nMaterial.

We propose Mamba Snake, a novel deep snake framework enhanced by state\nspace modeling for UMIS. Mamba Snake frames multi-contour evolution as a\nhierarchical state space atlas, effectively modeling macroscopic inter-organ\ntopological relationships and microscopic contour refinements. We introduce a\nsnake-specific vision state space module, the Mamba Evolution Block (MEB),\nwhich leverages effective spatiotemporal information aggregation for adaptive\nrefinement of complex morphologies. Energy map shape priors further ensure\nrobust long-range contour evolution in heterogeneous data. Additionally, a\ndual-classification synergy mechanism is incorporated to concurrently optimize\ndetection and segmentation, mitigating under-segmentation of microstructures in\nUMIS.

However, the heavy\nreliance on task-specific human demonstrations limits their generalization and\nincurs high data acquisition costs. In this work, we present a new notion of\ntask-agnostic action paradigm that decouples action execution from\ntask-specific conditioning, enhancing scalability, efficiency, and\ncost-effectiveness. To address the data collection challenges posed by this\nparadigm -- such as low coverage density, behavioral redundancy, and safety\nrisks -- we introduce ATARA (Automated Task-Agnostic Random Actions), a\nscalable self-supervised framework that accelerates collection by over $\n30\\times $ compared to human teleoperation. To further enable effective\nlearning from task-agnostic data, which often suffers from distribution\nmismatch and irrelevant trajectories, we propose AnyPos, an inverse dynamics\nmodel equipped with Arm-Decoupled Estimation and a Direction-Aware Decoder\n(DAD). We additionally integrate a video-conditioned action validation module\nto verify the feasibility of learned policies across diverse manipulation\ntasks. Extensive experiments show that the AnyPos-ATARA pipeline yields a 51%\nimprovement in test accuracy and achieves 30-40% higher success rates in\ndownstream tasks such as lifting, pick-and-place, and clicking, using\nreplay-based video validation.

Recent token merging methods\nimprove efficiency by reducing the number of tokens during attention\noperations, but often overlook the characteristics of attention-based image\ngeneration models, limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose\nlocal representative token guided merging (ReToM), a novel token merging\nstrategy applicable to any attention mechanism in image generation. To merge\ntokens based on various contextual information, ReToM defines local boundaries\nas windows within attention inputs and adjusts window sizes.

These findings demonstrate that outcome-only metrics are\ninsufficient for evaluating multi-agent performance and highlight the\nimportance of process-level diagnostics in designing more interpretable and\nresource-efficient collaborative AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "GEMMAS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e3a\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4fe1\u606f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5206\u6570\uff08IDS\uff09\u548c\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u8def\u5f84\u6bd4\u7387\uff08UPR\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ea7\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u534f\u4f5c\u6548\u7387\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u6700\u7ec8\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4f4e\u6548\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165GEMMAS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5efa\u6a21\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e3a\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe\uff0c\u63d0\u51faIDS\u548cUPR\u4e24\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ea7\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728GSM8K\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ec5\u5dee2.1%\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728IDS\u548cUPR\u4e0a\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0812.8%\u548c80%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ed3\u679c\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ea7\u8bca\u65ad\u5bf9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u6548\u534f\u4f5cAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Among various CIR approaches, training-free zero-shot\nmethods based on pre-trained models are cost-effective but still face notable\nlimitations. For example, sequential VLM-LLM pipelines process each modality\nindependently, which often results in information loss and limits cross-modal\ninteraction.

The first caption is used to filter candidate images. Subsequently, we\ncombine these two captions and the reference image to perform multi-grained\nre-ranking.

The lab consists of two\ntasks: Task A - Multilingual Job Title Matching, covering English, Spanish,\nGerman, and Chinese; and Task B - Job Title-Based Skill Prediction, in English.\nBoth corpora were built from real job applications, carefully anonymized, and\nmanually annotated to reflect the complexity and diversity of real-world labor\nmarket data, including linguistic variability and gender-marked expressions.\n  The evaluations included monolingual and cross-lingual scenarios and covered\nthe evaluation of gender bias.\n  TalentCLEF attracted 76 registered teams with more than 280 submissions.

ACM reuses the original captions\nfrom base models while incorporating user instructions and modality features to\ngenerate improved captions. To remedy the data scarcity in controllable\nmultimodal captioning, we build AnyCapDataset (ACD), covering three modalities,\n28 user-instruction types, and 300\\,k high-quality data entries. We further\npropose AnyCapEval, a new benchmark that provides more reliable evaluation\nmetrics for controllable captioning by decoupling content accuracy and\nstylistic fidelity. ACM markedly improves caption quality across a diverse set\nof base models on AnyCapEval. Notably, ACM-8B raises GPT-4o\\'s content scores\nby 45\\% and style scores by 12\\%, and it also achieves substantial gains on\nwidely used benchmarks such as MIA-Bench and VidCapBench.", "AI": {"tldr": "AnyCap\u9879\u76ee\u901a\u8fc7AnyCapModel\uff08ACM\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b57\u5e55\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165AnyCapDataset\uff08ACD\uff09\u548cAnyCapEval\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b57\u5e55\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u8bc4\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "ACM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7528\u6237\u6307\u4ee4\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u6539\u8fdb\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b57\u5e55\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "ACM\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b57\u5e55\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5728AnyCapEval\u4e2dGPT-4o\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u5f97\u5206\u63d0\u9ad845%\uff0c\u98ce\u683c\u5f97\u5206\u63d0\u9ad812%\u3002", "conclusion": "AnyCap\u9879\u76ee\u4e3a\u53ef\u63a7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b57\u5e55\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8bc4\u6d4b\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Finally, SRE\nutilizes ensemble learning to enhance the ability to capture domain-invariant\nattention maps between the source data and the simulated target data.

Recent post-training quantization (PTQ)\nmethods have attempted to mitigate this issue by focusing on the iterative\nnature of diffusion models. However, these approaches often overlook outliers,\nleading to degraded performance at low bit-widths. In this paper, we propose a\nDMQ which combines Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise\nPower-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to effectively address these challenges. Learned\nEquivalent Scaling optimizes channel-wise scaling factors to redistribute\nquantization difficulty between weights and activations, reducing overall\nquantization error. Recognizing that early denoising steps, despite having\nsmall quantization errors, crucially impact the final output due to error\naccumulation, we incorporate an adaptive timestep weighting scheme to\nprioritize these critical steps during learning. Furthermore, identifying that\nlayers such as skip connections exhibit high inter-channel variance, we\nintroduce channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling for activations. To ensure robust\nselection of PTS factors even with small calibration set, we introduce a voting\nalgorithm that enhances reliability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nmethod significantly outperforms existing works, especially at low bit-widths\nsuch as W4A6 (4-bit weight, 6-bit activation) and W4A8, maintaining high image\ngeneration quality and model stability.

However,\ninterrelationship among input modalities, uncertainties due to individual\nuni-modal data and potential clinical applications following such an\nuncertainty decomposition are yet fully understood in the context of\nlarge-scale MLLMs. In this work, we propose a multimodal uncertainty\npropagation model (MUPM) based on uncertainty propagation, to characterise the\nrelationship among the uncertainties arising from image-only, text-only, and\njoint image-text variations in MLLM inputs. Using real clinical data consisting\nof cardiac MR scans and digital health records, we describe that MUPMs can be\noptimised robustly with a few samples. We then show that the fitted MUPMs are\ngeneralisable across different input data distributions and, perhaps\nsurprisingly, across different downstream tasks. Such a transferability may be\nexplained by the shared pretraining, comparatively light MLLM fine-tuning,\nalong with the low-dimensional nature of the MUPMs. More importantly, this\nlearned transferability, quantifying the relationship between these\nuncertainties, led to direct clinical applications in which uncertainties may\nbe estimated and thus analysed robustly for varying data or even a novel set of\ncardiac disease prediction tasks. In addition, we show experimentally the\nefficiency in multimodal data required for estimating the overall uncertainty\nand its ability to identify redundant factors, both of which are considered\npractical yet clinically useful applications with the proposed MUPMs. Codes are\navailable at https://github.com/yucheng722/MUPM.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u6a21\u578b\uff08MUPM\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u6587\u672c\u53ca\u8054\u5408\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6e90\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u53ca\u5176\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u5c1a\u672a\u5b8c\u5168\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMUPM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u5206\u6790\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u6587\u672c\u53ca\u8054\u5408\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5fc3\u810fMR\u626b\u63cf\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "MUPM\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u9c81\u68d2\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u75be\u75c5\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "MUPM\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u5197\u4f59\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

A key difficulty in SR is estimating the unobservable feature, which\nencapsulates significant spectral information not captured by RGB imaging\nsensors. The solution lies in effectively constructing the spectral-spatial\njoint distribution conditioned on the RGB image to complement the unobservable\nfeature. Since HSIs share a similar spatial structure with the corresponding\nRGB images, it is rational to capitalize on the rich spatial knowledge in RGB\npre-trained models for spectral-spatial joint distribution learning. To this\nend, we extend the RGB pre-trained latent diffusion model (RGB-LDM) to an\nunobservable feature LDM (ULDM) for SR. As the RGB-LDM and its corresponding\nspatial autoencoder (SpaAE) already excel in spatial knowledge, the ULDM can\nfocus on modeling spectral structure. Moreover, separating the unobservable\nfeature from the HSI reduces the redundant spectral information and empowers\nthe ULDM to learn the joint distribution in a compact latent space.\nSpecifically, we propose a two-stage pipeline consisting of spectral structure\nrepresentation learning and spectral-spatial joint distribution learning to\ntransform the RGB-LDM into the ULDM. In the first stage, a spectral\nunobservable feature autoencoder (SpeUAE) is trained to extract and compress\nthe unobservable feature into a 3D manifold aligned with RGB space.

RS-TinyNet comes with two novel\ndesigns: tiny object saliency modeling and feature integrity reconstruction.\nGuided by these principles, we design three step-wise feature enhancement\nmodules. Among them, the multi-dimensional collaborative attention (MDCA)\nmodule employs multi-dimensional attention to enhance the saliency of tiny\nobjects. Additionally, the auxiliary reversible branch (ARB) and a progressive\nfusion detection head (PFDH) module are introduced to preserve information flow\nand fuse multi-level features to bridge semantic gaps and retain structural\ndetail. Comprehensive experiments on public RS dataset AI-TOD show that our\nRS-TinyNet surpasses existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) detectors by 4.0% AP and\n6.5% AP75. Evaluations on DIOR benchmark dataset further validate its superior\ndetection performance in diverse RS scenarios. These results demonstrate that\nthe proposed multi-stage feature fusion strategy offers an effective and\npractical solution for tiny object detection in complex RS environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "RS-TinyNet\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u4e0e\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u56e0\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u6709\u9650\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u5f31\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u590d\u6742\u800c\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRS-TinyNet\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u663e\u8457\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u91cd\u5efa\u4e24\u5927\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e09\u4e2a\u9010\u6b65\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\uff08MDCA\u3001ARB\u3001PFDH\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728AI-TOD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0aAP\u63d0\u53474.0%\uff0cAP75\u63d0\u53476.5%\uff0cDIOR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u9065\u611f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Finally, a\ntransformer-based matcher and differentiable pose estimation layer enable\nprecise camera motion estimation by learning good matches. Against prior\ndetector-descriptor networks like SuperPoint, DINO-VO demonstrates greater\nrobustness in challenging environments. Furthermore, we show superior accuracy\nand generalization of the proposed feature descriptors against standalone\nDINOv2 coarse features. DINO-VO outperforms prior frame-to-frame VO methods on\nthe TartanAir and KITTI datasets and is competitive on EuRoC dataset, while\nrunning efficiently at 72 FPS with less than 1GB of memory usage on a single\nGPU.

Previous methods solve the issue of\ninsufficient observation by leveraging 4D diffusion models to generate videos\nat novel viewpoints. However, the generated videos from these models often lack\nspatio-temporal consistency, thus degrading view synthesis quality. In this\npaper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the\nspatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define\na latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human\npose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoising the\nlatent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and\nfinally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised\nlatents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across\nthe latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field\nand thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory\nconsumption affordable.

We then design a plug-and-play VideoITG model,\nwhich takes advantage of visual language alignment and reasoning capabilities\nof Video-LLMs, for effective frame selection in a discriminative manner.\nCoupled with Video-LLMs, VideoITG achieves consistent performance improvements\nacross multiple multimodal video understanding benchmarks, showing its\nsuperiority and great potentials for video understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "VideoITG\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7VidThinker\u7ba1\u9053\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u89c6\u9891\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5e27\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528VidThinker\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6307\u4ee4\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7247\u6bb5\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6307\u4ee4\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u9009\u62e9\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86VideoITG-40K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "VideoITG\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}
