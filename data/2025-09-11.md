### [1] [Bilingual Word Level Language Identification for Omotic Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07998)
*Mesay Gemeda Yigezu,Girma Yohannis Bade,Atnafu Lambebo Tonja,Olga Kolesnikova,Grigori Sidorov,Alexander Gelbukh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了埃塞俄比亚南部瓦拉塔语和戈菲语的双语语言识别任务，采用BERT预训练模型组合LSTM方法，在测试集上获得0.72的F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多语言社区中，文本常包含多种语言，而瓦拉塔语和戈菲语之间存在词汇相似性和差异性，使语言识别任务面临挑战。

Method: 采用多种实验方法，最终选择BERT预训练语言模型与LSTM结合的方法来进行双语语言识别。

Result: 在测试集上获得了F1分数0.72的结果，表现最佳。

Conclusion: 该研究对解决社交媒体中的不良问题有效，并为该领域的进一步研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Language identification is the task of determining the languages for a given
text. In many real world scenarios, text may contain more than one language,
particularly in multilingual communities. Bilingual Language Identification
(BLID) is the task of identifying and distinguishing between two languages in a
given text. This paper presents BLID for languages spoken in the southern part
of Ethiopia, namely Wolaita and Gofa. The presence of words similarities and
differences between the two languages makes the language identification task
challenging. To overcome this challenge, we employed various experiments on
various approaches. Then, the combination of the BERT based pretrained language
model and LSTM approach performed better, with an F1 score of 0.72 on the test
set. As a result, the work will be effective in tackling unwanted social media
issues and providing a foundation for further research in this area.

### [2] [AntiDote: Bi-level Adversarial Training for Tamper-Resistant LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08000)
*Debdeep Sanyal,Manodeep Ray,Murari Mandal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AntiDote是一种双层优化方法，通过对抗性超网络训练LLM抵抗恶意微调攻击，在保持模型能力的同时显著提升安全性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源权重LLM面临恶意微调攻击的风险，现有安全措施难以在保持模型通用能力的同时抵抗具有完全模型访问权限的对手攻击

Method: 使用双层优化程序，包含辅助对抗性超网络生成恶意LoRA权重，训练防御者LLM来抵消这些对抗性权重添加的影响

Result: 在52种红队攻击测试中，AntiDote比篡改抵抗和遗忘基线方法强27.4%，在MMLU等能力基准上性能下降小于0.5%

Conclusion: AntiDote提供了一种实用且计算高效的方法，使安全性成为开源权重模型中更内在和弹性的属性

Abstract: The release of open-weight large language models (LLMs) creates a tension
between advancing accessible research and preventing misuse, such as malicious
fine-tuning to elicit harmful content. Current safety measures struggle to
preserve the general capabilities of the LLM while resisting a determined
adversary with full access to the model's weights and architecture, who can use
full-parameter fine-tuning to erase existing safeguards. To address this, we
introduce AntiDote, a bi-level optimization procedure for training LLMs to be
resistant to such tampering. AntiDote involves an auxiliary adversary
hypernetwork that learns to generate malicious Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
weights conditioned on the defender model's internal activations. The defender
LLM is then trained with an objective to nullify the effect of these
adversarial weight additions, forcing it to maintain its safety alignment. We
validate this approach against a diverse suite of 52 red-teaming attacks,
including jailbreak prompting, latent space manipulation, and direct
weight-space attacks. AntiDote is upto 27.4\% more robust against adversarial
attacks compared to both tamper-resistance and unlearning baselines. Crucially,
this robustness is achieved with a minimal trade-off in utility, incurring a
performance degradation of upto less than 0.5\% across capability benchmarks
including MMLU, HellaSwag, and GSM8K. Our work offers a practical and compute
efficient methodology for building open-weight models where safety is a more
integral and resilient property.

### [3] [MVPBench: A Benchmark and Fine-Tuning Framework for Aligning Large Language Models with Diverse Human Values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08022)
*Yao Liang,Dongcheng Zhao,Feifei Zhao,Guobin Shen,Yuwei Wang,Dongqi Liang,Yi Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MVPBench是一个新颖的基准测试，系统评估LLM在75个国家/地区的多维人类价值偏好对齐情况，包含24,020个高质量实例，揭示了跨地域和人口统计线的显著对齐差异，并证明轻量级微调方法可以显著提升价值对齐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试往往忽视文化和人口多样性，导致对价值对齐在全球范围内泛化能力的理解有限，需要开发更全面的评估资源来理解LLM如何与不同人群的价值观对齐。

Method: 引入MVPBench基准测试，包含24,020个带有细粒度价值标签、个性化问题和丰富人口统计元数据的高质量实例；使用该基准对多个最先进LLM进行深入分析；采用LoRA和DPO等轻量级微调方法来增强价值对齐。

Result: 发现LLM在地理和人口统计线上存在显著的对齐性能差异；轻量级微调方法在域内和域外设置中都能显著提升价值对齐效果。

Conclusion: 研究强调了进行人口感知对齐评估的必要性，为构建文化适应性和价值敏感的LLM提供了可行见解，MVPBench为全球对齐、个性化价值建模和公平AI开发的未来研究提供了实用基础。

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values is critical
for their safe and effective deployment across diverse user populations.
However, existing benchmarks often neglect cultural and demographic diversity,
leading to limited understanding of how value alignment generalizes globally.
In this work, we introduce MVPBench, a novel benchmark that systematically
evaluates LLMs' alignment with multi-dimensional human value preferences across
75 countries. MVPBench contains 24,020 high-quality instances annotated with
fine-grained value labels, personalized questions, and rich demographic
metadata, making it the most comprehensive resource of its kind to date. Using
MVPBench, we conduct an in-depth analysis of several state-of-the-art LLMs,
revealing substantial disparities in alignment performance across geographic
and demographic lines. We further demonstrate that lightweight fine-tuning
methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO), can significantly enhance value alignment in both in-domain and
out-of-domain settings. Our findings underscore the necessity for
population-aware alignment evaluation and provide actionable insights for
building culturally adaptive and value-sensitive LLMs. MVPBench serves as a
practical foundation for future research on global alignment, personalized
value modeling, and equitable AI development.

Abstract: This paper presents the methodologies and results of the NOWJ team's
participation across all five tasks at the COLIEE 2025 competition, emphasizing
advancements in the Legal Case Entailment task (Task 2). Our comprehensive
approach systematically integrates pre-ranking models (BM25, BERT, monoT5),
embedding-based semantic representations (BGE-m3, LLM2Vec), and advanced Large
Language Models (Qwen-2, QwQ-32B, DeepSeek-V3) for summarization, relevance
scoring, and contextual re-ranking. Specifically, in Task 2, our two-stage
retrieval system combined lexical-semantic filtering with contextualized LLM
analysis, achieving first place with an F1 score of 0.3195. Additionally, in
other tasks--including Legal Case Retrieval, Statute Law Retrieval, Legal
Textual Entailment, and Legal Judgment Prediction--we demonstrated robust
performance through carefully engineered ensembles and effective prompt-based
reasoning strategies. Our findings highlight the potential of hybrid models
integrating traditional IR techniques with contemporary generative models,
providing a valuable reference for future advancements in legal information
processing.

### [5] [SciGPT: A Large Language Model for Scientific Literature Understanding and Knowledge Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08032)
*Fengyu She,Nan Wang,Hongfei Wu,Ziyi Wan,Jingmian Wang,Chang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SciGPT是一个针对科学文献理解的领域适应基础模型，通过低成本领域蒸馏、SMoE注意力机制和知识感知适应等创新技术，在科学任务上超越GPT-4o表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学文献呈指数级增长，研究人员需要高效的知识合成工具。通用大语言模型在科学领域存在技术术语理解不足、方法论严谨性把握困难等问题，限制了其在跨学科研究中的应用。

Method: 基于Qwen3架构，采用三阶段创新：1）低成本领域蒸馏的两阶段管道；2）稀疏专家混合注意力机制减少内存消耗55%；3）知识感知适应整合领域本体以弥合跨学科知识差距。

Result: 在ScienceBench基准测试中，SciGPT在序列标注、生成和推理等核心科学任务上优于GPT-4o，并在未见科学任务中表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SciGPT验证了其在促进AI增强科学发现方面的潜力，为科学文献理解提供了有效的领域适应解决方案。

Abstract: Scientific literature is growing exponentially, creating a critical
bottleneck for researchers to efficiently synthesize knowledge. While
general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential in text processing,
they often fail to capture scientific domain-specific nuances (e.g., technical
jargon, methodological rigor) and struggle with complex scientific tasks,
limiting their utility for interdisciplinary research. To address these gaps,
this paper presents SciGPT, a domain-adapted foundation model for scientific
literature understanding and ScienceBench, an open source benchmark tailored to
evaluate scientific LLMs.
  Built on the Qwen3 architecture, SciGPT incorporates three key innovations:
(1) low-cost domain distillation via a two-stage pipeline to balance
performance and efficiency; (2) a Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) attention
mechanism that cuts memory consumption by 55\% for 32,000-token long-document
reasoning; and (3) knowledge-aware adaptation integrating domain ontologies to
bridge interdisciplinary knowledge gaps.
  Experimental results on ScienceBench show that SciGPT outperforms GPT-4o in
core scientific tasks including sequence labeling, generation, and inference.
It also exhibits strong robustness in unseen scientific tasks, validating its
potential to facilitate AI-augmented scientific discovery.

*Flor Miriam Plaza-del-Arco,Paul Röttger,Nino Scherrer,Emanuele Borgonovo,Elmar Plischke,Dirk Hovy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM个性化可能导致错误拒绝请求，但通过系统测试发现模型能力和任务类型对错误拒绝的影响比人物设定更大，人物设定效应可能被高估


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型日益个性化，但人物设定提示可能导致模型错误拒绝用户请求，需要量化这种问题的严重程度

Method: 使用15种社会人口学人物设定、16个不同模型、3个任务类型和9种提示改写，提出蒙特卡洛方法高效量化错误拒绝问题

Result: 模型能力越强，人物设定对拒绝率的影响越小；某些社会人口学人物设定会增加错误拒绝，但模型选择和任务类型的影响更大，特别是在敏感内容任务中

Conclusion: 人物设定效应可能被高估，错误拒绝更多受模型能力和任务类型影响，而非人物设定本身

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into our daily lives
and personalized. However, LLM personalization might also increase unintended
side effects. Recent work suggests that persona prompting can lead models to
falsely refuse user requests. However, no work has fully quantified the extent
of this issue. To address this gap, we measure the impact of 15
sociodemographic personas (based on gender, race, religion, and disability) on
false refusal. To control for other factors, we also test 16 different models,
3 tasks (Natural Language Inference, politeness, and offensiveness
classification), and nine prompt paraphrases. We propose a Monte Carlo-based
method to quantify this issue in a sample-efficient manner. Our results show
that as models become more capable, personas impact the refusal rate less and
less. Certain sociodemographic personas increase false refusal in some models,
which suggests underlying biases in the alignment strategies or safety
mechanisms. However, we find that the model choice and task significantly
influence false refusals, especially in sensitive content tasks. Our findings
suggest that persona effects have been overestimated, and might be due to other
factors.

### [7] [Culturally transmitted color categories in LLMs reflect a learning bias toward efficient compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08093)
*Nathaniel Imel,Noga Zaslavsky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型能够通过信息瓶颈原则演化出类似人类的高效语义系统，特别是在颜色命名领域，表现出与人类相似的归纳偏好和压缩效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型是否能够演化出类似人类的高效语义分类系统，验证信息瓶颈原则在LLMs中的适用性

Method: 使用Gemini 2.0-flash和Llama 3.3-70B-Instruct模型，复现人类颜色命名行为研究，包括英语颜色命名研究和模拟文化演化的迭代上下文学习

Result: Gemini与英语母语者的命名模式高度一致且IB效率得分显著，Llama表现出高效但复杂度较低的系统；两种模型都能通过迭代学习将随机系统重构为更高IB效率的系统

Conclusion: LLMs能够演化出感知基础的人类化语义系统，其驱动原理与人类语言语义效率的基本原理相同

Abstract: Converging evidence suggests that systems of semantic categories across human
languages achieve near-optimal compression via the Information Bottleneck (IB)
complexity-accuracy principle. Large language models (LLMs) are not trained for
this objective, which raises the question: are LLMs capable of evolving
efficient human-like semantic systems? To address this question, we focus on
the domain of color as a key testbed of cognitive theories of categorization
and replicate with LLMs (Gemini 2.0-flash and Llama 3.3-70B-Instruct) two
influential human behavioral studies. First, we conduct an English color-naming
study, showing that Gemini aligns well with the naming patterns of native
English speakers and achieves a significantly high IB-efficiency score, while
Llama exhibits an efficient but lower complexity system compared to English.
Second, to test whether LLMs simply mimic patterns in their training data or
actually exhibit a human-like inductive bias toward IB-efficiency, we simulate
cultural evolution of pseudo color-naming systems in LLMs via iterated
in-context language learning. We find that akin to humans, LLMs iteratively
restructure initially random systems towards greater IB-efficiency and
increased alignment with patterns observed across the world's languages. These
findings demonstrate that LLMs are capable of evolving perceptually grounded,
human-like semantic systems, driven by the same fundamental principle that
governs semantic efficiency across human languages.

### [8] [MERLIN: Multi-Stage Curriculum Alignment for Multilingual Encoder and LLM Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08105)
*Kosei Uemura,David Guzmán,Quang Phuoc Nguyen,Jesujoba Oluwadara Alabi,En-shiun Annie Lee,David Ifeoluwa Adelani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MERLIN是一个两阶段模型堆叠框架，通过课程学习策略和DoRA权重适配，显著提升低资源语言的复杂推理能力，在AfriMGSM基准上比MindMerger提升12.9个百分点，甚至超越GPT-4o-mini。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在中等和高资源语言上表现良好，但在低资源语言上仍存在较大差距，需要开发专门针对低资源语言复杂推理能力提升的方法。

Method: 采用两阶段模型堆叠框架，应用从通用双语平行语料到任务特定数据的课程学习策略，仅适配少量DoRA权重。

Result: 在AfriMGSM基准上准确率提升12.9个百分点，超越GPT-4o-mini；在MGSM和MSVAMP上也分别获得0.9和2.8个百分点的稳定提升。

Conclusion: MERLIN框架在低资源和高资源环境下都表现出有效性，为低资源语言的复杂推理任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models excel in English but still struggle with complex
reasoning in many low-resource languages (LRLs). Existing encoder-plus-decoder
methods such as LangBridge and MindMerger raise accuracy on mid and
high-resource languages, yet they leave a large gap on LRLs. We present MERLIN,
a two-stage model-stacking framework that applies a curriculum learning
strategy -- from general bilingual bitext to task-specific data -- and adapts
only a small set of DoRA weights. On the AfriMGSM benchmark MERLIN improves
exact-match accuracy by +12.9 pp over MindMerger and outperforms GPT-4o-mini.
It also yields consistent gains on MGSM and MSVAMP (+0.9 and +2.8 pp),
demonstrating effectiveness across both low and high-resource settings.

*Nivedha Sivakumar,Natalie Mackraz,Samira Khorshidi,Krishna Patel,Barry-John Theobald,Luca Zappella,Nicholas Apostoloff*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现假设假设错误：假设错误可以通过提示调整从颇法大语言模型传递到适配模型，而且常见的提示去假设方法无法一致防止假设传递。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 证明假设传递假设的错误性，因为这个假设导致人们误以为假设不会从颇法LLM传递到适配模型，而提示调整是实际应用中极其普遍的适配策略。

Method: 在因果模型中研究提示适配下的假设传递假设，分析不同人口统计特征和任务中内在假设与提示适配后假设的相关性，并评估多种提示去假设策略的效果。

Result: 发现假设可以通过提示传递，内在假设与提示适配后假设的相关性在不同人口统计特征和任务中保持中等至强相关（如性别相关系数≥0.94，年龄≥0.98，宗教≥0.69）。少样本组成参数变化时假设相关性仍强劲（≥0.90）。各种提示去假设策略有不同优势但无法一致减少假设传递。

Conclusion: 约正内在模型中的假设和推理能力可能是防止假设向下游任务传播的有效方法。

Abstract: A dangerous assumption that can be made from prior work on the bias transfer
hypothesis (BTH) is that biases do not transfer from pre-trained large language
models (LLMs) to adapted models. We invalidate this assumption by studying the
BTH in causal models under prompt adaptations, as prompting is an extremely
popular and accessible adaptation strategy used in real-world applications. In
contrast to prior work, we find that biases can transfer through prompting and
that popular prompt-based mitigation methods do not consistently prevent biases
from transferring. Specifically, the correlation between intrinsic biases and
those after prompt adaptation remain moderate to strong across demographics and
tasks -- for example, gender (rho >= 0.94) in co-reference resolution, and age
(rho >= 0.98) and religion (rho >= 0.69) in question answering. Further, we
find that biases remain strongly correlated when varying few-shot composition
parameters, such as sample size, stereotypical content, occupational
distribution and representational balance (rho >= 0.90). We evaluate several
prompt-based debiasing strategies and find that different approaches have
distinct strengths, but none consistently reduce bias transfer across models,
tasks or demographics. These results demonstrate that correcting bias, and
potentially improving reasoning ability, in intrinsic models may prevent
propagation of biases to downstream tasks.

*Supriya Lall,Christian Farrell,Hari Pathanjaly,Marko Pavic,Sarvesh Chezhian,Masataro Asai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种称为"语言化算法"的新范式，通过将复杂任务分解为LLM能够可靠执行的简单自然语言操作，并利用经典算法的理论保证来提高LLM推理任务的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的一次性查询LLM方式对于推理任务不可靠，需要一种更系统的方法来利用LLM的能力，同时避免其不可预测性。

Method: 使用语言化算法，将任务分解为简单的自然语言基本操作（如二元比较），让LLM只执行这些可靠的小任务，然后通过经典算法（如双调排序网络）来组合这些操作。

Result: 在排序和聚类任务上证明了该方法的有效性，相比一次性查询方式更加可靠。

Conclusion: 语言化算法提供了一种将LLM能力与经典算法理论保证相结合的系统性方法，能够提高复杂推理任务的可靠性。

Abstract: Instead of querying LLMs in a one-shot manner and hoping to get the right
answer for a reasoning task, we propose a paradigm we call \emph{verbalized
algorithms} (VAs), which leverage classical algorithms with established
theoretical understanding. VAs decompose a task into simple elementary
operations on natural language strings that they should be able to answer
reliably, and limit the scope of LLMs to only those simple tasks. For example,
for sorting a series of natural language strings, \emph{verbalized sorting}
uses an LLM as a binary comparison oracle in a known and well-analyzed sorting
algorithm (e.g., bitonic sorting network). We demonstrate the effectiveness of
this approach on sorting and clustering tasks.

### [11] [Balancing Quality and Variation: Spam Filtering Distorts Data Label Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08217)
*Eve Fleisig,Matthias Orlikowski,Philipp Cimiano,Dan Klein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 现有标注者过滤方法在主观任务中常错误移除意见分歧的标注者而非垃圾标注者，导致准确性和标签多样性之间的次优权衡。研究发现保守的标注者移除比例（<5%）最佳，且垃圾标注者往往比非垃圾标注者更不随机。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 如何在保持机器学习数据集中多样意见的同时过滤垃圾或低质量标注，平衡标注者可靠性和代表性。

Method: 通过实证评估一系列标注者过滤启发式方法对主观任务中变异保留的影响，分析合成垃圾数据上的性能。

Result: 现有方法常错误移除意见分歧的标注者；保守移除比例（<5%）效果最佳；垃圾标注者往往给出固定答案而非随机答案，分布上与真实标注者难以区分。

Conclusion: 需要开发考虑标签多样性的垃圾过滤方法，因为现有基于变异即垃圾假设的方法在保留变异的任务中表现不佳。

Abstract: For machine learning datasets to accurately represent diverse opinions in a
population, they must preserve variation in data labels while filtering out
spam or low-quality responses. How can we balance annotator reliability and
representation? We empirically evaluate how a range of heuristics for annotator
filtering affect the preservation of variation on subjective tasks. We find
that these methods, designed for contexts in which variation from a single
ground-truth label is considered noise, often remove annotators who disagree
instead of spam annotators, introducing suboptimal tradeoffs between accuracy
and label diversity. We find that conservative settings for annotator removal
(<5%) are best, after which all tested methods increase the mean absolute error
from the true average label. We analyze performance on synthetic spam to
observe that these methods often assume spam annotators are less random than
real spammers tend to be: most spammers are distributionally indistinguishable
from real annotators, and the minority that are distinguishable tend to give
fixed answers, not random ones. Thus, tasks requiring the preservation of
variation reverse the intuition of existing spam filtering methods: spammers
tend to be less random than non-spammers, so metrics that assume variation is
spam fare worse. These results highlight the need for spam removal methods that
account for label diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解不同格式文档如何共享信息对信息检索、摘要和内容对齐任务至关重要。

Method: 采用问答基础方法，利用共享问题的可回答性作为语义覆盖指标，通过对SQuAD语料库进行重写和选择性省略信息来构建合成数据集。

Result: 判别模型显著超过生成方法，RoBERTa-base模型达到最高准确率61.4%，随机森林模型获得最佳平衡式综合分数律52.9%。

Conclusion: 问答提供了有效的视角来评估不同风格文本间的语义关系，为现有模型进行深层信息推理提供了见解。

Abstract: Understanding how information is shared across documents, regardless of the
format in which it is expressed, is critical for tasks such as information
retrieval, summarization, and content alignment. In this work, we introduce a
novel framework for modelling Semantic Coverage Relations (SCR), which
classifies document pairs based on how their informational content aligns. We
define three core relation types: equivalence, where both texts convey the same
information using different textual forms or styles; inclusion, where one
document fully contains the information of another and adds more; and semantic
overlap, where each document presents partially overlapping content. To capture
these relations, we adopt a question answering (QA)-based approach, using the
answerability of shared questions across documents as an indicator of semantic
coverage. We construct a synthetic dataset derived from the SQuAD corpus by
paraphrasing source passages and selectively omitting information, enabling
precise control over content overlap. This dataset allows us to benchmark
generative language models and train transformer-based classifiers for SCR
prediction. Our findings demonstrate that discriminative models significantly
outperform generative approaches, with the RoBERTa-base model achieving the
highest accuracy of 61.4% and the Random Forest-based model showing the best
balance with a macro-F1 score of 52.9%. The results show that QA provides an
effective lens for assessing semantic relations across stylistically diverse
texts, offering insights into the capacity of current models to reason about
information beyond surface similarity. The dataset and code developed in this
study are publicly available to support reproducibility.

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are excellent at generating synthetic
data. However, their performance in sensitive domains such as text
detoxification has not received proper attention from the scientific community.
This paper explores the possibility of using LLM-generated synthetic toxic data
as an alternative to human-generated data for training models for
detoxification. Using Llama 3 and Qwen activation-patched models, we generated
synthetic toxic counterparts for neutral texts from ParaDetox and SST-2
datasets. Our experiments show that models fine-tuned on synthetic data
consistently perform worse than those trained on human data, with a drop in
performance of up to 30% in joint metrics. The root cause is identified as a
critical lexical diversity gap: LLMs generate toxic content using a small,
repetitive vocabulary of insults that fails to capture the nuances and variety
of human toxicity. These findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs in
this domain and emphasize the continued importance of diverse, human-annotated
data for building robust detoxification systems.

*Yu Cheng Chih,Yong Hao Hou*

TL;DR: ETLCH是一个基于LLaMA的10亿参数小模型，通过少量样本微调在结构化数据提取任务中表现出色，以低成本实现可靠的信息提取


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在结构化数据提取任务中成本高昂且需要大量高质量数据，小团队难以承受。目前缺乏小模型在低资源多任务条件下可靠性的研究证据

Method: 基于LLaMA架构的10亿参数模型，使用低秩适应（LoRA）技术，每个任务仅用几百到一千个样本进行微调，应用于JSON提取、知识图谱提取和命名实体识别任务

Result: ETLCH在大多数评估指标上超越了强基线模型，即使在最低数据规模下也观察到显著增益

Conclusion: 经过良好调优的小模型能够以极低的计算成本提供稳定准确的结构化输出，使资源受限环境能够构建经济高效且可靠的信息提取流程

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) for structured data extraction in
domains such as financial compliance reporting, legal document analytics, and
multilingual knowledge base construction is often impractical for smaller teams
due to the high cost of running large architectures and the difficulty of
preparing large, high-quality datasets. Most recent instruction-tuning studies
focus on seven-billion-parameter or larger models, leaving limited evidence on
whether much smaller models can work reliably under low-resource, multi-task
conditions. This work presents ETLCH, a billion-parameter LLaMA-based model
fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation on only a few hundred to one thousand
samples per task for JSON extraction, knowledge graph extraction, and named
entity recognition. Despite its small scale, ETLCH outperforms strong baselines
across most evaluation metrics, with substantial gains observed even at the
lowest data scale. These findings demonstrate that well-tuned small models can
deliver stable and accurate structured outputs at a fraction of the
computational cost, enabling cost-effective and reliable information extraction
pipelines in resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: 现有SpeechRE数据集依赖合成语音缺乏多样性，模型存在单一生成模板和弱语义对齐问题

Method: 构建CommonVoice-SpeechRE数据集，提出RPG-MoGe框架：多序三元组生成集成策略和CNN基于隐含关系预测头生成显式提示

Result: 方法在新数据集上超越现有最佳方法，为实际应用提供了标准数据集和有效解决方案

Conclusion: 该研究为语音关系提取领域提供了量质俱佳的数据集和高效的多模态对齐方法，推动了该领域的实际应用进展

Abstract: Speech Relation Extraction (SpeechRE) aims to extract relation triplets
directly from speech. However, existing benchmark datasets rely heavily on
synthetic data, lacking sufficient quantity and diversity of real human speech.
Moreover, existing models also suffer from rigid single-order generation
templates and weak semantic alignment, substantially limiting their
performance. To address these challenges, we introduce CommonVoice-SpeechRE, a
large-scale dataset comprising nearly 20,000 real-human speech samples from
diverse speakers, establishing a new benchmark for SpeechRE research.
Furthermore, we propose the Relation Prompt-Guided Multi-Order Generative
Ensemble (RPG-MoGe), a novel framework that features: (1) a multi-order triplet
generation ensemble strategy, leveraging data diversity through diverse element
orders during both training and inference, and (2) CNN-based latent relation
prediction heads that generate explicit relation prompts to guide cross-modal
alignment and accurate triplet generation. Experiments show our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing both a benchmark dataset and an
effective solution for real-world SpeechRE. The source code and dataset are
publicly available at https://github.com/NingJinzhong/SpeechRE_RPG_MoGe.

Motivation: 在假信息流传的时代，自动事实检证系统容易受到对抗攻击的威胁，这些攻击可能曲解事实、误导决策者并劳动检验模型的可靠性。尽管相关研究趋势增长，但对关键挑战的全面概览仍缺乏。

Method: 该调查采用系统化方法，首次深入评估针对事实检证的对抗攻击。研究对现有攻击方法进行分类，评估它们对自动事实检证系统的影响，并检查最新的防御技术进展。

Result: 研究发现当前的事实检证模型在对抗攻击面前存在显著弱点，需要更加关注系统的鲁棒性。调查识别了多种攻击策略和其对检验准确性的影响。

Abstract: In an era where misinformation spreads freely, fact-checking (FC) plays a
crucial role in verifying claims and promoting reliable information. While
automated fact-checking (AFC) has advanced significantly, existing systems
remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that manipulate or generate claims,
evidence, or claim-evidence pairs. These attacks can distort the truth, mislead
decision-makers, and ultimately undermine the reliability of FC models. Despite
growing research interest in adversarial attacks against AFC systems, a
comprehensive, holistic overview of key challenges remains lacking. These
challenges include understanding attack strategies, assessing the resilience of
current models, and identifying ways to enhance robustness. This survey
provides the first in-depth review of adversarial attacks targeting FC,
categorizing existing attack methodologies and evaluating their impact on AFC
systems. Additionally, we examine recent advancements in adversary-aware
defenses and highlight open research questions that require further
exploration. Our findings underscore the urgent need for resilient FC
frameworks capable of withstanding adversarial manipulations in pursuit of
preserving high verification accuracy.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Acquiescence bias, i.e. the tendency of humans to agree with statements in
surveys, independent of their actual beliefs, is well researched and
documented. Since Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be very
influenceable by relatively small changes in input and are trained on
human-generated data, it is reasonable to assume that they could show a similar
tendency. We present a study investigating the presence of acquiescence bias in
LLMs across different models, tasks, and languages (English, German, and
Polish). Our results indicate that, contrary to humans, LLMs display a bias
towards answering no, regardless of whether it indicates agreement or
disagreement.

TL;DR: 研究发现人物提示(persona-prompting)在调节语言抽象度方面效果有限，可能传播刻板印象，即使是在模拟边缘群体声音时也存在风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人物提示方法对LLMs在表示社会群体时语言抽象度的影响，这是刻板印象的一个标志性指标。

Method: 基于语言学期望偏差框架，分析6个开源LLM在三种提示条件下的输出，比较11种人物驱动响应与通用AI助手的响应，使用新构建的Self-Stereo数据集，通过具体性、特异性和否定性三个指标测量抽象度。

Result: 人物提示在调节语言抽象度方面效果有限，证实了人物作为社会人口群体代表的生态学批评，并引发了对即使看似唤起边缘群体声音时也可能传播刻板印象的担忧。

Conclusion: 人物提示方法在减少刻板印象语言表达方面存在局限性，需要更谨慎地使用这种方法来避免强化社会偏见。

Abstract: Persona-prompting is a growing strategy to steer LLMs toward simulating
particular perspectives or linguistic styles through the lens of a specified
identity. While this method is often used to personalize outputs, its impact on
how LLMs represent social groups remains underexplored. In this paper, we
investigate whether persona-prompting leads to different levels of linguistic
abstraction - an established marker of stereotyping - when generating short
texts linking socio-demographic categories with stereotypical or
non-stereotypical attributes. Drawing on the Linguistic Expectancy Bias
framework, we analyze outputs from six open-weight LLMs under three prompting
conditions, comparing 11 persona-driven responses to those of a generic AI
assistant. To support this analysis, we introduce Self-Stereo, a new dataset of
self-reported stereotypes from Reddit. We measure abstraction through three
metrics: concreteness, specificity, and negation. Our results highlight the
limits of persona-prompting in modulating abstraction in language, confirming
criticisms about the ecology of personas as representative of socio-demographic
groups and raising concerns about the risk of propagating stereotypes even when
seemingly evoking the voice of a marginalized group.

Motivation: 现有方法往往单独优化对齐维度，导致权衡和不一致行为；MoE架构存在路由校准不佳的问题，限制了在对齐任务中的有效性

Method: 提出TrinityX框架，为每个HHH维度单独训练专家，通过任务自适应校准路由机制整合专家输出，形成统一的对齐感知表示

Result: 在三个标准对齐基准测试中，TrinityX相比基线方法在胜率上提升32.5%，安全分数提升33.9%，真实性提升28.4%，同时内存使用和推理延迟降低40%以上

Conclusion: TrinityX通过校准路由机制有效解决了多维度对齐问题，在保持高性能的同时显著提升了效率，具有良好的泛化能力

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong performance across a wide range
of NLP tasks, yet aligning their outputs with the principles of Helpfulness,
Harmlessness, and Honesty (HHH) remains a persistent challenge. Existing
methods often optimize for individual alignment dimensions in isolation,
leading to trade-offs and inconsistent behavior. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architectures offer modularity, they suffer from poorly calibrated routing,
limiting their effectiveness in alignment tasks. We propose TrinityX, a modular
alignment framework that incorporates a Mixture of Calibrated Experts (MoCaE)
within the Transformer architecture. TrinityX leverages separately trained
experts for each HHH dimension, integrating their outputs through a calibrated,
task-adaptive routing mechanism that combines expert signals into a unified,
alignment-aware representation. Extensive experiments on three standard
alignment benchmarks-Alpaca (Helpfulness), BeaverTails (Harmlessness), and
TruthfulQA (Honesty)-demonstrate that TrinityX outperforms strong baselines,
achieving relative improvements of 32.5% in win rate, 33.9% in safety score,
and 28.4% in truthfulness. In addition, TrinityX reduces memory usage and
inference latency by over 40% compared to prior MoE-based approaches. Ablation
studies highlight the importance of calibrated routing, and cross-model
evaluations confirm TrinityX's generalization across diverse LLM backbones.

Method: 设计了基于一致性的数据选择方法CM-Align，包括两部分：一致性指导的英语参考选择和跨语言一致性基于的多语言偏好数据构建

Result: 在三个大语言模型和三个常见任务上的实验结果证明了方法的有效性和优势性

Conclusion: 高质量偏好数据的构建对于多语言对齐至关重要，CM-Align方法能够有效提升多语言对齐性能

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) generally show a significant performance
gap in alignment between English and other languages. To bridge this gap,
existing research typically leverages the model's responses in English as a
reference to select the best/worst responses in other languages, which are then
used for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training. However, we argue that
there are two limitations in the current methods that result in noisy
multilingual preference data and further limited alignment performance: 1) Not
all English responses are of high quality, and using a response with low
quality may mislead the alignment for other languages. 2) Current methods
usually use biased or heuristic approaches to construct multilingual preference
pairs. To address these limitations, we design a consistency-based data
selection method to construct high-quality multilingual preference data for
improving multilingual alignment (CM-Align). Specifically, our method includes
two parts: consistency-guided English reference selection and cross-lingual
consistency-based multilingual preference data construction. Experimental
results on three LLMs and three common tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our method, which further indicates the necessity of
constructing high-quality preference data.

TL;DR: 本文探索如何利用多个大语言模型的集成方法，在不需要密集调整或标签数据的情况下，实现生物医学问答任务的最新性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学问答面临知识专业性强、数据量庞大且更新快速的挑战，需要准确解释专业知识。但传统基于领域调整的系统成本高且缺乏通用性。

Method: 采用集成学习方法，结合多个大语言模型（包括Anthropic和Google的模型）的输出，通过集成投票生成更准确和稳健的答案。使用检索增强生成（RAG）流水线，重点关注信息检索的准确性以确保模型在相关信息范围内运作。

Result: 在BioASQ挑战任务上，集成方法超过了单个大语言模型，并在某些情况下能够挑战或超过领域调整系统。研究还发现上下文长度与性能存在关联：展开的上下文虽能提供价值证据，但也带来信息淀浇和模型迷失的风险。

Conclusion: 集成基于零检查的方法结合有效的RAG流水线，构成了一种实用且可扩展的替代方案，可以替代领域调整系统用于生物医学问题回答。准确、集中的信息检索仍然是确保大语言模型在相关信息范围内生成答案的关键基础。

Abstract: Biomedical question answering (QA) poses significant challenges due to the
need for precise interpretation of specialized knowledge drawn from a vast,
complex, and rapidly evolving corpus. In this work, we explore how large
language models (LLMs) can be used for information retrieval (IR), and an
ensemble of zero-shot models can accomplish state-of-the-art performance on a
domain-specific Yes/No QA task. Evaluating our approach on the BioASQ challenge
tasks, we show that ensembles can outperform individual LLMs and in some cases
rival or surpass domain-tuned systems - all while preserving generalizability
and avoiding the need for costly fine-tuning or labeled data. Our method
aggregates outputs from multiple LLM variants, including models from Anthropic
and Google, to synthesize more accurate and robust answers. Moreover, our
investigation highlights a relationship between context length and performance:
while expanded contexts are meant to provide valuable evidence, they
simultaneously risk information dilution and model disorientation. These
findings emphasize IR as a critical foundation in Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) approaches for biomedical QA systems. Precise, focused
retrieval remains essential for ensuring LLMs operate within relevant
information boundaries when generating answers from retrieved documents. Our
results establish that ensemble-based zero-shot approaches, when paired with
effective RAG pipelines, constitute a practical and scalable alternative to
domain-tuned systems for biomedical question answering.

Motivation: 虽然LLM在医学领域应用广泛，但对其记忆医学训练数据的程度和特征了解不深入，需要系统性评估记忆现象对医学应用的影响

Method: 系统分析了三种常见适配场景：医学语料续预训练、标准医学测试集细调、真实临床数据细调（包括超13,000份在院病历），评估记忆的频率、特征、量级和下游影响

Result: 记忆现象在所有适配场景中都普遍存在，且显著高于普通领域。记忆可分为三类：有益记忆（准确回忆临床指南等）、无信息记忆（模板化语言）、有害记忆（敏感临床信息泄漏）

Conclusion: 记忆现象影响医学LLM的发展和采用，需要提供实用建议来：促进有益记忆提升领域知识准确性、减少无信息记忆促进深度学习、减缓有害记忆防止敏感信息泄漏

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in
medicine. To date, LLMs have been widely applied to tasks such as diagnostic
assistance, medical question answering, and clinical information synthesis.
However, a key open question remains: to what extent do LLMs memorize medical
training data. In this study, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of
memorization of LLMs in medicine, assessing its prevalence (how frequently it
occurs), characteristics (what is memorized), volume (how much content is
memorized), and potential downstream impacts (how memorization may affect
medical applications). We systematically analyze common adaptation scenarios:
(1) continued pretraining on medical corpora, (2) fine-tuning on standard
medical benchmarks, and (3) fine-tuning on real-world clinical data, including
over 13,000 unique inpatient records from Yale New Haven Health System. The
results demonstrate that memorization is prevalent across all adaptation
scenarios and significantly higher than reported in the general domain.
Memorization affects both the development and adoption of LLMs in medicine and
can be categorized into three types: beneficial (e.g., accurate recall of
clinical guidelines and biomedical references), uninformative (e.g., repeated
disclaimers or templated medical document language), and harmful (e.g.,
regeneration of dataset-specific or sensitive clinical content). Based on these
findings, we offer practical recommendations to facilitate beneficial
memorization that enhances domain-specific reasoning and factual accuracy,
minimize uninformative memorization to promote deeper learning beyond
surface-level patterns, and mitigate harmful memorization to prevent the
leakage of sensitive or identifiable patient information.

Method: OTESGN模型包含语法图感知注意力挖掘潜在语法依赖、语义最优传输注意力发现细粒度语义对齐、自适应注意力融合模块整合异构特征，以及对比正则化提升鲁棒性

Result: 在Twitter和Laptop14基准测试中分别比之前最佳模型提升1.01%和1.30%的F1分数，消融研究和可视化分析验证了其在精确定位意见词和抗噪声方面的有效性

Conclusion: OTESGN通过语法-语义协同注意力机制有效解决了ABSA任务中的噪声干扰问题，实现了更精确的情感分析性能

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to identify aspect terms and
determine their sentiment polarity. While dependency trees combined with
contextual semantics effectively identify aspect sentiment, existing methods
relying on syntax trees and aspect-aware attention struggle to model complex
semantic relationships. Their dependence on linear dot-product features fails
to capture nonlinear associations, allowing noisy similarity from irrelevant
words to obscure key opinion terms. Motivated by Differentiable Optimal
Matching, we propose the Optimal Transport Enhanced Syntactic-Semantic Graph
Network (OTESGN), which introduces a Syntactic-Semantic Collaborative
Attention. It comprises a Syntactic Graph-Aware Attention for mining latent
syntactic dependencies and modeling global syntactic topology, as well as a
Semantic Optimal Transport Attention designed to uncover fine-grained semantic
alignments amidst textual noise, thereby accurately capturing sentiment signals
obscured by irrelevant tokens. A Adaptive Attention Fusion module integrates
these heterogeneous features, and contrastive regularization further improves
robustness. Experiments demonstrate that OTESGN achieves state-of-the-art
results, outperforming previous best models by +1.01% F1 on Twitter and +1.30%
F1 on Laptop14 benchmarks. Ablative studies and visual analyses corroborate its
efficacy in precise localization of opinion words and noise resistance.

Abstract: Multi-turn-to-single-turn (M2S) compresses iterative red-teaming into one
structured prompt, but prior work relied on a handful of manually written

The system pairs smart sampling from 12 sources with an LLM-as-judge inspired
by StrongREJECT and records fully auditable logs.
  Maintaining selection pressure by setting the success threshold to $\theta =
0.70$, we obtain five evolutionary generations, two new template families, and
44.8% overall success (103/230) on GPT-4.1. A balanced cross-model panel of
2,500 trials (judge fixed) shows that structural gains transfer but vary by
target; two models score zero at the same threshold. We also find a positive
coupling between prompt length and score, motivating length-aware judging.
  Our results demonstrate that structure-level search is a reproducible route
to stronger single-turn probes and underscore the importance of threshold
calibration and cross-model evaluation. Code, configurations, and artifacts are

Motivation: 传统序列到序列生成要么是离线方式（完整输入后输出），要么需要学习复杂的流控制策略。DSM旨在提供更灵活、高效的流式多模态序列生成方案。

Method: 将时间对齐移至预处理步骤，在不同流之间引入适当延迟，使用仅解码器语言模型处理已对齐的流，支持任意输入组合的流式推理。

Result: 在自动语音识别和文本转语音任务上，DSM实现了最先进的性能和延迟，支持任意长序列处理，甚至可与离线基线竞争。

Conclusion: DSM为多模态流式序列到序列学习提供了通用且高效的框架，在保持低延迟的同时实现了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: We introduce Delayed Streams Modeling (DSM), a flexible formulation for
streaming, multimodal sequence-to-sequence learning. Sequence-to-sequence
generation is often cast in an offline manner, where the model consumes the
complete input sequence before generating the first output timestep.
Alternatively, streaming sequence-to-sequence rely on learning a policy for
choosing when to advance on the input stream, or write to the output stream.
DSM instead models already time-aligned streams with a decoder-only language
model. By moving the alignment to a pre-processing step,and introducing
appropriate delays between streams, DSM provides streaming inference of
arbitrary output sequences, from any input combination, making it applicable to
many sequence-to-sequence problems. In particular, given text and audio
streams, automatic speech recognition (ASR) corresponds to the text stream
being delayed, while the opposite gives a text-to-speech (TTS) model. We
perform extensive experiments for these two major sequence-to-sequence tasks,
showing that DSM provides state-of-the-art performance and latency while
supporting arbitrary long sequences, being even competitive with offline
baselines. Code, samples and demos are available at

Motivation: 理解Transformer语言模型如何存储和检索事实关联对于提高可解释性和实现针对性模型编辑至关重要，但先前研究主要基于GPT模型，不清楚这些发现是否适用于其他自回归架构。

Method: 对多个模型（GPT、LLaMA、Qwen和DeepSeek）进行事实回忆的全面评估，分析事实信息在何处以及如何被编码和访问。

Result: 发现基于Qwen的模型表现出与先前模式不同的行为：最早层的注意力模块比MLP模块对事实回忆的贡献更大。

Conclusion: 即使在自回归Transformer家族内部，架构变化也会导致根本不同的事实回忆机制，这对模型解释和编辑具有重要意义。

Abstract: Understanding how Transformer-based language models store and retrieve
factual associations is critical for improving interpretability and enabling
targeted model editing. Prior work, primarily on GPT-style models, has
identified MLP modules in early layers as key contributors to factual recall.
However, it remains unclear whether these findings generalize across different
autoregressive architectures. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of factual recall across several models -- including GPT, LLaMA,
Qwen, and DeepSeek -- analyzing where and how factual information is encoded
and accessed. Consequently, we find that Qwen-based models behave differently
from previous patterns: attention modules in the earliest layers contribute
more to factual recall than MLP modules. Our findings suggest that even within
the autoregressive Transformer family, architectural variations can lead to
fundamentally different mechanisms of factual recall.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), when paired with prompt-based tasks, have
significantly reduced data annotation costs and reliance on human annotators.
However, evaluating the quality of their annotations remains challenging in
dynamic, unsupervised environments where oracle feedback is scarce and
conventional methods fail. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
agentic annotation paradigm, where a student model collaborates with a noisy
teacher (the LLM) to assess and refine annotation quality without relying on
oracle feedback. The student model, acting as an unsupervised feedback
mechanism, employs a user preference-based majority voting strategy to evaluate
the consistency of the LLM outputs. To systematically measure the reliability
of LLM-generated annotations, we introduce the Consistent and Inconsistent
(CAI) Ratio, a novel unsupervised evaluation metric. The CAI Ratio not only
quantifies the annotation quality of the noisy teacher under limited user
preferences but also plays a critical role in model selection, enabling the
identification of robust LLMs in dynamic, unsupervised environments. Applied to
ten open-domain NLP datasets across four LLMs, the CAI Ratio demonstrates a
strong positive correlation with LLM accuracy, establishing it as an essential
tool for unsupervised evaluation and model selection in real-world settings.

*Hailay Kidu Teklehaymanot,Dren Fazlija,Wolfgang Nejdl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MoVoC是一种结合形态分析和BPE的分词方法，专门针对Geez文字的低资源形态复杂语言，通过保持形态完整性来提高语言保真度和分词效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的子词分词方法往往无法保持形态边界，这在低资源、形态复杂的语言（如Geez文字语言）中尤为明显，需要一种能够整合形态学知识的分词方法。

Method: 提出MoVoC方法，将监督式形态分析整合到子词词汇表中，结合基于语素和BPE的分词方式，构建了MoVoC-Tok分词器。

Result: 虽然在机器翻译质量上没有显著提升，但在内在指标MorphoScore和Boundary Precision上观察到一致改进，表明形态感知分词在语言保真度和分词效率方面的价值。

Conclusion: MoVoC方法为低资源形态丰富语言提供了有效的分词解决方案，发布的形态标注数据集和分词器将支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Subword-based tokenization methods often fail to preserve morphological
boundaries, a limitation especially pronounced in low-resource, morphologically
complex languages such as those written in the Geez script. To address this, we
present MoVoC (Morpheme-aware Subword Vocabulary Construction) and train
MoVoC-Tok, a tokenizer that integrates supervised morphological analysis into
the subword vocabulary. This hybrid segmentation approach combines
morpheme-based and Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokens to preserve morphological
integrity while maintaining lexical meaning. To tackle resource scarcity, we
curate and release manually annotated morpheme data for four Geez script
languages and a morpheme-aware vocabulary for two of them. While the proposed
tokenization method does not lead to significant gains in automatic translation
quality, we observe consistent improvements in intrinsic metrics, MorphoScore,
and Boundary Precision, highlighting the value of morphology-aware segmentation
in enhancing linguistic fidelity and token efficiency. Our morpheme-annotated
datasets and tokenizer will be publicly available to support further research
in low-resource, morphologically rich languages. Our code and data are
available on GitHub: https://github.com/hailaykidu/MoVoC

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要集中于英语，对其他语言的LLM训练语料库构建方法了解不足，需要研究如何生成高质量的多语言训练数据

Method: 使用可扩展的网络数据采集方法，构建8461萄牙语120B标记语料库，通过持续预训练设置研究不同数据选择和预处理策略，包括语言特定过滤流水线、STEM分类器和毒性内容识别

Result: 构建的葡萄牙语语料库达到了与商业级语料库竞争的效果，语言适配能够显著提升模型性能，证明了高质量语言特定数据的重要性

Conclusion: 语言特定的过滤流水线和高质量语料库对多语言LLM发展至关重要，虽然案例研究以葡萄牙语为主，但方法可扩展到其他语言，为多语言模型开发提供了有价值的见解

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) is deeply influenced by the
quality and composition of their training data. While much of the existing work
has centered on English, there remains a gap in understanding how to construct
effective training corpora for other languages. We explore scalable methods for
building web-based corpora for LLMs. We apply them to build a new 120B token
corpus in Portuguese that achieves competitive results to an industrial-grade
corpus. Using a continual pretraining setup, we study how different data
selection and preprocessing strategies affect LLM performance when
transitioning a model originally trained in English to another language. Our
findings demonstrate the value of language-specific filtering pipelines,
including classifiers for education, science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics (STEM), as well as toxic content. We show that adapting a model to
the target language leads to performance improvements, reinforcing the
importance of high-quality, language-specific data. While our case study
focuses on Portuguese, our methods are applicable to other languages, offering
insights for multilingual LLM development.

TL;DR: 这篇论文揭示了LLM注释数据中存在的"LLM hacking"风险，即研究者的实现选择（模型、提示策略等）导致统计结论偏差，经过大规模实验发现约1/3的假设得出错误结论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在社会科学研究中广泛应用，研究者的实现选择导致的输出变化可能引入系统性偏差和随机错误，影响研究结论的可靠性。

Method: 复现21项已发表社会科学研究中的37个数据注释任务，使用18个不同模型生成1300万个LLM标签，测试2,361个实际假设来量化研究者选择对统计结论的影响。

Result: 发现约1/3的假设得出错误结论（先进模型）和一半的假设得出错误结论（小模型）。效果量越大风险越小，但即使高准确模型也不能完全消除风险。人工注释有助于减少偏差，而常见的回归校正技术效果有限。

Conclusion: LLM注释数据存在重大风险，研究者需要更严格的验证流程和人工检查来确保结论的可靠性，特别是在显著性阈值附近的发现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming social science research
by enabling the automation of labor-intensive tasks like data annotation and
text analysis. However, LLM outputs vary significantly depending on the
implementation choices made by researchers (e.g., model selection, prompting
strategy, or temperature settings). Such variation can introduce systematic
biases and random errors, which propagate to downstream analyses and cause Type
I, Type II, Type S, or Type M errors. We call this LLM hacking.
  We quantify the risk of LLM hacking by replicating 37 data annotation tasks
from 21 published social science research studies with 18 different models.
Analyzing 13 million LLM labels, we test 2,361 realistic hypotheses to measure
how plausible researcher choices affect statistical conclusions. We find
incorrect conclusions based on LLM-annotated data in approximately one in three
hypotheses for state-of-the-art models, and in half the hypotheses for small
language models. While our findings show that higher task performance and
better general model capabilities reduce LLM hacking risk, even highly accurate
models do not completely eliminate it. The risk of LLM hacking decreases as
effect sizes increase, indicating the need for more rigorous verification of
findings near significance thresholds. Our extensive analysis of LLM hacking
mitigation techniques emphasizes the importance of human annotations in
reducing false positive findings and improving model selection. Surprisingly,
common regression estimator correction techniques are largely ineffective in
reducing LLM hacking risk, as they heavily trade off Type I vs. Type II errors.
  Beyond accidental errors, we find that intentional LLM hacking is
unacceptably simple. With few LLMs and just a handful of prompt paraphrases,
anything can be presented as statistically significant.

Abstract: In this paper, we survey recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for
reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs). RL has achieved remarkable success
in advancing the frontier of LLM capabilities, particularly in addressing
complex logical tasks such as mathematics and coding. As a result, RL has
emerged as a foundational methodology for transforming LLMs into LRMs. With the
rapid progress of the field, further scaling of RL for LRMs now faces
foundational challenges not only in computational resources but also in
algorithm design, training data, and infrastructure. To this end, it is timely
to revisit the development of this domain, reassess its trajectory, and explore
strategies to enhance the scalability of RL toward Artificial SuperIntelligence
(ASI). In particular, we examine research applying RL to LLMs and LRMs for
reasoning abilities, especially since the release of DeepSeek-R1, including
foundational components, core problems, training resources, and downstream
applications, to identify future opportunities and directions for this rapidly
evolving area. We hope this review will promote future research on RL for
broader reasoning models. Github:

Motivation: 现有世界建模研究主要关注2D图像和视频生成方法，忽视了快速发展的3D和4D表示方法（如RGB-D、占据网格、LiDAR点云），且缺乏标准化的定义和分类体系，导致文献中的研究碎片化且不一致。

Method: 建立了精确的定义体系，提出了结构化分类法（视频生成、占据生成、LiDAR生成），系统总结了3D/4D数据集和评估指标，并对现有文献进行了系统梳理。

Abstract: World modeling has become a cornerstone in AI research, enabling agents to
understand, represent, and predict the dynamic environments they inhabit. While
prior work largely emphasizes generative methods for 2D image and video data,
they overlook the rapidly growing body of work that leverages native 3D and 4D
representations such as RGB-D imagery, occupancy grids, and LiDAR point clouds
for large-scale scene modeling. At the same time, the absence of a standardized
definition and taxonomy for ``world models'' has led to fragmented and
sometimes inconsistent claims in the literature. This survey addresses these
gaps by presenting the first comprehensive review explicitly dedicated to 3D
and 4D world modeling and generation. We establish precise definitions,
introduce a structured taxonomy spanning video-based (VideoGen),
occupancy-based (OccGen), and LiDAR-based (LiDARGen) approaches, and
systematically summarize datasets and evaluation metrics tailored to 3D/4D
settings. We further discuss practical applications, identify open challenges,
and highlight promising research directions, aiming to provide a coherent and
foundational reference for advancing the field. A systematic summary of

TL;DR: XFloodNet是一个基于深度学习的城市洪水分类框架，通过多模态特征融合和注意力机制，在三个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统洪水检测方法依赖单模态数据和静态规则系统，无法捕捉洪水事件的动态非线性关系，现有注意力机制和集成学习方法在层次细化、跨模态特征集成和对噪声环境的适应性方面存在局限。

Method: 提出了XFloodNet框架，包含三个核心组件：层次化跨模态门控注意力机制、异构卷积自适应多尺度注意力模块，以及级联卷积Transformer特征细化技术。

Result: 在Chennai Floods、Rhine18 Floods和Harz17 Floods三个数据集上分别达到93.33%、82.24%和88.60%的F1分数，显著超越现有方法。

Conclusion: XFloodNet通过先进的深度学习技术重新定义了城市洪水分类，为可持续城市发展提供了有效的洪水检测解决方案。

Abstract: In an era of escalating climate change, urban flooding has emerged as a
critical challenge for sustainable cities, threatening lives, infrastructure,
and ecosystems. Traditional flood detection methods are constrained by their
reliance on unimodal data and static rule-based systems, which fail to capture
the dynamic, non-linear relationships inherent in flood events. Furthermore,
existing attention mechanisms and ensemble learning approaches exhibit
limitations in hierarchical refinement, cross-modal feature integration, and
adaptability to noisy or unstructured environments, resulting in suboptimal
flood classification performance. To address these challenges, we present
XFloodNet, a novel framework that redefines urban flood classification through
advanced deep-learning techniques. XFloodNet integrates three novel components:
(1) a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Gated Attention mechanism that dynamically
aligns visual and textual features, enabling precise multi-granularity
interactions and resolving contextual ambiguities; (2) a Heterogeneous
Convolutional Adaptive Multi-Scale Attention module, which leverages
frequency-enhanced channel attention and frequency-modulated spatial attention
to extract and prioritize discriminative flood-related features across spectral
and spatial domains; and (3) a Cascading Convolutional Transformer Feature
Refinement technique that harmonizes hierarchical features through adaptive
scaling and cascading operations, ensuring robust and noise-resistant flood
detection. We evaluate our proposed method on three benchmark datasets, such as
Chennai Floods, Rhine18 Floods, and Harz17 Floods, XFloodNet achieves
state-of-the-art F1-scores of 93.33%, 82.24%, and 88.60%, respectively,
surpassing existing methods by significant margins.

TL;DR: Video Parallel Scaling (VPS) 是一种推理时方法，通过并行处理视频帧子集来扩展VideoLLMs的感知带宽，避免长上下文带来的计算成本问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VideoLLMs在处理长视频时面临计算成本过高和性能下降的问题，需要在不增加上下文窗口的情况下提升时间推理能力

Method: 运行多个并行推理流，每个流处理视频帧的不同子集，然后聚合输出概率来整合更丰富的视觉信息

Result: 在多个模型架构和规模（2B-32B）上的实验表明，VPS能显著提升性能，在Video-MME和EventHallusion等基准测试中表现优异

Conclusion: VPS提供了一种内存效率高且鲁棒的框架，可有效增强VideoLLMs的时间推理能力，比自一致性等其他并行方法更具扩展优势

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) face a critical bottleneck:
increasing the number of input frames to capture fine-grained temporal detail
leads to prohibitive computational costs and performance degradation from long
context lengths. We introduce Video Parallel Scaling (VPS), an inference-time
method that expands a model's perceptual bandwidth without increasing its
context window. VPS operates by running multiple parallel inference streams,
each processing a unique, disjoint subset of the video's frames. By aggregating
the output probabilities from these complementary streams, VPS integrates a
richer set of visual information than is possible with a single pass. We
theoretically show that this approach effectively contracts the Chinchilla
scaling law by leveraging uncorrelated visual evidence, thereby improving
performance without additional training. Extensive experiments across various
model architectures and scales (2B-32B) on benchmarks such as Video-MME and
EventHallusion demonstrate that VPS consistently and significantly improves
performance. It scales more favorably than other parallel alternatives (e.g.
Self-consistency) and is complementary to other decoding strategies, offering a
memory-efficient and robust framework for enhancing the temporal reasoning
capabilities of VideoLLMs.

Conclusion: 该多模态框架通过整合文本和视觉信息，能够在立场检测任务中实现更稳健的分类效果，为社交媒体分析提供了更完整的解决方案

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of information across digital platforms, stance
detection has emerged as a pivotal challenge in social media analysis. While
most of the existing approaches focus solely on textual data, real-world social
media content increasingly combines text with visual elements creating a need
for advanced multimodal methods. To address this gap, we propose a multimodal
stance detection framework that integrates textual and visual information
through a hierarchical fusion approach. Our method first employs a Large
Language Model to retrieve stance-relevant summaries from source text, while a
domain-aware image caption generator interprets visual content in the context
of the target topic. These modalities are then jointly modeled along with the
reply text, through a specialized transformer module that captures interactions
between the texts and images. The proposed modality fusion framework integrates
diverse modalities to facilitate robust stance classification. We evaluate our
approach on the MultiClimate dataset, a benchmark for climate change-related
stance detection containing aligned video frames and transcripts. We achieve
accuracy of 76.2%, precision of 76.3%, recall of 76.2% and F1-score of 76.2%,
respectively, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: This work presents a new dataset for the Martian digital elevation model
prediction task, ready for machine learning applications called MCTED. The
dataset has been generated using a comprehensive pipeline designed to process
high-resolution Mars orthoimage and DEM pairs from Day et al., yielding a
dataset consisting of 80,898 data samples. The source images are data gathered
by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter using the CTX instrument, providing a very
diverse and comprehensive coverage of the Martian surface. Given the complexity
of the processing pipelines used in large-scale DEMs, there are often artefacts
and missing data points in the original data, for which we developed tools to
solve or mitigate their impact. We divide the processed samples into training
and validation splits, ensuring samples in both splits cover no mutual areas to
avoid data leakage. Every sample in the dataset is represented by the optical
image patch, DEM patch, and two mask patches, indicating values that were
originally missing or were altered by us. This allows future users of the
dataset to handle altered elevation regions as they please. We provide
statistical insights of the generated dataset, including the spatial
distribution of samples, the distributions of elevation values, slopes and
more. Finally, we train a small U-Net architecture on the MCTED dataset and
compare its performance to a monocular depth estimation foundation model,
DepthAnythingV2, on the task of elevation prediction. We find that even a very
small architecture trained on this dataset specifically, beats a zero-shot
performance of a depth estimation foundation model like DepthAnythingV2. We
make the dataset and code used for its generation completely open source in
public repositories.

TL;DR: 提出APML损失函数，通过可微分的Sinkhorn迭代实现点云预测任务中的一对一匹配，解决了传统损失函数的多对一对应问题，在保持接近二次时间复杂度的情况下获得更好的空间分布和收敛性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统点云损失函数（如CD、HyperCD、InfoCD）存在多对一对应问题，导致点云在密集区域拥堵、稀疏区域覆盖不足，且包含不可微操作；EMD虽然能实现一对一匹配但计算复杂度太高。

Method: 提出自适应概率匹配损失（APML），基于温度缩放的相似度矩阵进行Sinkhorn迭代，自动计算温度参数保证最小分配概率，实现完全可微分的一对一匹配近似。

Result: 在ShapeNet基准测试和WiFi CSI到3D人体点云生成任务中，APML损失实现了更快的收敛速度、更好的空间分布（特别是在低密度区域），定量性能相当或更优，且无需额外超参数搜索。

Conclusion: APML损失提供了一种计算高效、完全可微分的点云匹配解决方案，在保持接近CD损失时间复杂度的同时，获得了类似EMD的一对一匹配优势，适用于各种点云预测任务。

Abstract: Training deep learning models for point cloud prediction tasks such as shape
completion and generation depends critically on loss functions that measure
discrepancies between predicted and ground-truth point sets. Commonly used
functions such as Chamfer Distance (CD), HyperCD, and InfoCD rely on
nearest-neighbor assignments, which often induce many-to-one correspondences,
leading to point congestion in dense regions and poor coverage in sparse
regions. These losses also involve non-differentiable operations due to index
selection, which may affect gradient-based optimization. Earth Mover Distance
(EMD) enforces one-to-one correspondences and captures structural similarity
more effectively, but its cubic computational complexity limits its practical
use. We propose the Adaptive Probabilistic Matching Loss (APML), a fully
differentiable approximation of one-to-one matching that leverages Sinkhorn
iterations on a temperature-scaled similarity matrix derived from pairwise
distances. We analytically compute the temperature to guarantee a minimum
assignment probability, eliminating manual tuning. APML achieves near-quadratic
runtime, comparable to Chamfer-based losses, and avoids non-differentiable
operations. When integrated into state-of-the-art architectures (PoinTr, PCN,
FoldingNet) on ShapeNet benchmarks and on a spatiotemporal Transformer (CSI2PC)
that generates 3D human point clouds from WiFi CSI measurements, APM loss
yields faster convergence, superior spatial distribution, especially in
low-density regions, and improved or on-par quantitative performance without
additional hyperparameter search. The code is available at:

Motivation: 现有深度展开网络在红外小目标检测中存在参数不够轻量和噪声鲁棒性不足的问题，需要开发更高效的解决方案。

Method: 基于RPCA构建分层瓶颈结构进行通道维度调整和特征提取，嵌入噪声抑制模块，并采用SENet通道注意力机制关注不同特征的重要性。

Result: 在ISTD数据集上的大量实验验证了该方法相比RPCANet、DRPCANet和RPCANet++等先进方法的优越性。

Conclusion: L-RPCANet在保持轻量化和鲁棒性的同时实现了优异性能，为红外小目标检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) is one of the key techniques in image
processing. Although deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have demonstrated promising
performance in ISTD due to their model interpretability and data adaptability,
existing methods still face significant challenges in parameter lightweightness
and noise robustness. In this regard, we propose a highly lightweight framework
based on robust principal component analysis (RPCA) called L-RPCANet.
Technically, a hierarchical bottleneck structure is constructed to reduce and
increase the channel dimension in the single-channel input infrared image to
achieve channel-wise feature refinement, with bottleneck layers designed in
each module to extract features. This reduces the number of channels in feature
extraction and improves the lightweightness of network parameters. Furthermore,
a noise reduction module is embedded to enhance the robustness against complex
noise. In addition, squeeze-and-excitation networks (SENets) are leveraged as a
channel attention mechanism to focus on the varying importance of different
features across channels, thereby achieving excellent performance while
maintaining both lightweightness and robustness. Extensive experiments on the
ISTD datasets validate the superiority of our proposed method compared with
state-of-the-art methods covering RPCANet, DRPCANet, and RPCANet++. The code
will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/L-RPCANet.

Conclusion: USS策略是实现芯片上完整视频SCI系统的良好选择，其固定曝光时间特性和高动态范围使其在实际应用中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Digital cameras consume ~0.1 microjoule per pixel to capture and encode
video, resulting in a power usage of ~20W for a 4K sensor operating at 30 fps.
Imagining gigapixel cameras operating at 100-1000 fps, the current processing
model is unsustainable. To address this, physical layer compressive measurement
has been proposed to reduce power consumption per pixel by 10-100X. Video
Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) introduces high frequency modulation in the
optical sensor layer to increase effective frame rate. A commonly used sampling
strategy of video SCI is Random Sampling (RS) where each mask element value is
randomly set to be 0 or 1. Similarly, image inpainting (I2P) has demonstrated
that images can be recovered from a fraction of the image pixels. Inspired by
I2P, we propose Ultra-Sparse Sampling (USS) regime, where at each spatial
location, only one sub-frame is set to 1 and all others are set to 0. We then
build a Digital Micro-mirror Device (DMD) encoding system to verify the
effectiveness of our USS strategy. Ideally, we can decompose the USS
measurement into sub-measurements for which we can utilize I2P algorithms to
recover high-speed frames. However, due to the mismatch between the DMD and
CCD, the USS measurement cannot be perfectly decomposed. To this end, we
propose BSTFormer, a sparse TransFormer that utilizes local Block attention,
global Sparse attention, and global Temporal attention to exploit the sparsity
of the USS measurement. Extensive results on both simulated and real-world data
show that our method significantly outperforms all previous state-of-the-art
algorithms. Additionally, an essential advantage of the USS strategy is its
higher dynamic range than that of the RS strategy. Finally, from the
application perspective, the USS strategy is a good choice to implement a
complete video SCI system on chip due to its fixed exposure time.

Conclusion: GTA-Crime为致命暴力检测提供了可行的合成数据解决方案，通过域适应技术成功将游戏生成数据应用于真实场景的异常检测

Abstract: Recent advancements in video anomaly detection (VAD) have enabled
identification of various criminal activities in surveillance videos, but
detecting fatal incidents such as shootings and stabbings remains difficult due
to their rarity and ethical issues in data collection. Recognizing this
limitation, we introduce GTA-Crime, a fatal video anomaly dataset and
generation framework using Grand Theft Auto 5 (GTA5). Our dataset contains
fatal situations such as shootings and stabbings, captured from CCTV multiview
perspectives under diverse conditions including action types, weather, time of
day, and viewpoints. To address the rarity of such scenarios, we also release a
framework for generating these types of videos. Additionally, we propose a
snippet-level domain adaptation strategy using Wasserstein adversarial training
to bridge the gap between synthetic GTA-Crime features and real-world features
like UCF-Crime. Experimental results validate our GTA-Crime dataset and
demonstrate that incorporating GTA-Crime with our domain adaptation strategy
consistently enhances real world fatal violence detection accuracy. Our dataset
and the data generation framework are publicly available at

Motivation: 解决ViT架构预训练在自然图像上需要三通道输入，而胸部X光扫描本质上是灰度单通道图像的不匹配问题

Method: 采用通道复制策略，将单通道CXR图像复制为三通道格式，以适应ViT架构输入要求，不引入额外信息损失

Result: 在三个基准数据集上表现优异：TB-CXR数据集准确率99.9%、AUC 99.9%；儿科肺炎数据集准确率99.0%、AUC 99.0%；深圳TB数据集准确率91.1%、AUC 91.2%，均超越现有最佳方法

Conclusion: 简单有效的通道复制策略使ViT能够在灰度医学影像任务中充分发挥表征能力，为TB和肺炎检测建立了新的技术标杆，具有实际临床部署潜力

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging remains one of the most widely used diagnostic
tools for detecting pulmonary diseases such as tuberculosis (TB) and pneumonia.
Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Vision Transformers (ViTs), have
shown strong potential for automated medical image analysis. However, most ViT
architectures are pretrained on natural images and require three-channel
inputs, while CXR scans are inherently grayscale. To address this gap, we
propose RepViT-CXR, a channel replication strategy that adapts single-channel
CXR images into a ViT-compatible format without introducing additional
information loss. We evaluate RepViT-CXR on three benchmark datasets. On the
TB-CXR dataset,our method achieved an accuracy of 99.9% and an AUC of 99.9%,
surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods such as Topo-CXR (99.3% accuracy,
99.8% AUC). For the Pediatric Pneumonia dataset, RepViT-CXR obtained 99.0%
accuracy, with 99.2% recall, 99.3% precision, and an AUC of 99.0%,
outperforming strong baselines including DCNN and VGG16. On the Shenzhen TB
dataset, our approach achieved 91.1% accuracy and an AUC of 91.2%, marking a
performance improvement over previously reported CNN-based methods. These
results demonstrate that a simple yet effective channel replication strategy
allows ViTs to fully leverage their representational power on grayscale medical
imaging tasks. RepViT-CXR establishes a new state of the art for TB and
pneumonia detection from chest X-rays, showing strong potential for deployment
in real-world clinical screening systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究大多基于预训练或忽略了脑部疾病引起的不对称特征，需要一种能够更好捕捉AD引起的脑结构不对称变化的深度学习方法。

Method: 使用3D CNN编码器提取特征，通过对称交互Transformer(SIT)处理左右半球对齐特征，重点关注由结构变化引起的不对称区域。

Abstract: Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) combined with deep learning has
achieved remarkable progress in the prediction and diagnosis of Alzheimer's
disease (AD). Existing studies have used CNN and transformer to build a
well-performing network, but most of them are based on pretraining or ignoring
the asymmetrical character caused by brain disorders. We propose an end-to-end
network for the detection of disease-based asymmetric induced by left and right
brain atrophy which consist of 3D CNN Encoder and Symmetry Interactive
Transformer (SIT). Following the inter-equal grid block fetch operation, the
corresponding left and right hemisphere features are aligned and subsequently
fed into the SIT for diagnostic analysis. SIT can help the model focus more on
the regions of asymmetry caused by structural changes, thus improving
diagnostic performance. We evaluated our method based on the ADNI dataset, and
the results show that the method achieves better diagnostic accuracy (92.5\%)
compared to several CNN methods and CNNs combined with a general transformer.
The visualization results show that our network pays more attention in regions
of brain atrophy, especially for the asymmetric pathological characteristics
induced by AD, demonstrating the interpretability and effectiveness of the
method.

Motivation: 传统帧相机长时间曝光会产生明显的视觉模糊和帧间信息丢失，严重影响视频质量。事件相机具有高时间分辨率，可以用于解决运动模糊问题。

Method: 提出Learnable Double Integral (LDI)网络估计参考帧与清晰潜在图像的映射关系；引入基于学习的除法重建模块优化结果和训练效率；设计自适应无参数融合策略利用LDI输出的置信度；构建自监督学习框架利用模糊帧、潜在图像和事件流之间的相互约束进行训练。

Conclusion: EVDI++是一个有效的统一自监督框架，能够利用事件相机的高时间分辨率来解决视频模糊和插值问题，在真实场景中具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Frame-based cameras with extended exposure times often produce perceptible
visual blurring and information loss between frames, significantly degrading
video quality. To address this challenge, we introduce EVDI++, a unified
self-supervised framework for Event-based Video Deblurring and Interpolation
that leverages the high temporal resolution of event cameras to mitigate motion
blur and enable intermediate frame prediction. Specifically, the Learnable
Double Integral (LDI) network is designed to estimate the mapping relation
between reference frames and sharp latent images. Then, we refine the coarse
results and optimize overall training efficiency by introducing a
learning-based division reconstruction module, enabling images to be converted
with varying exposure intervals. We devise an adaptive parameter-free fusion
strategy to obtain the final results, utilizing the confidence embedded in the
LDI outputs of concurrent events. A self-supervised learning framework is
proposed to enable network training with real-world blurry videos and events by
exploring the mutual constraints among blurry frames, latent images, and event
streams. We further construct a dataset with real-world blurry images and
events using a DAVIS346c camera, demonstrating the generalizability of the
proposed EVDI++ in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in video deblurring and interpolation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的光谱追踪器通常无法抓取内在的光谱信息、时间依赖性和跨深度交互作用，需要一种新的方法来充分利用超谱图像中丰富的光谱信息和细致的材质区分能力。

Method: 提出HyMamba网络，通过谱状态集成(SSI)模块进行谱特征的渐进式精炼咄传播，内置超谱Mamba(HSM)模块通过三个方向扫描SSMs同步学习空间和谱信息，构建假色和超谱输入的联合特征并与原始谱特征进行交互增强。

Conclusion: HyMamba通过状态空间模块有效地统一了谱、跨深度咄时间建模，为超谱对象追踪领域提供了一种新的解决方案，显著提升了追踪性能。

Abstract: Hyperspectral object tracking holds great promise due to the rich spectral
information and fine-grained material distinctions in hyperspectral images,
which are beneficial in challenging scenarios. While existing hyperspectral
trackers have made progress by either transforming hyperspectral data into
false-color images or incorporating modality fusion strategies, they often fail
to capture the intrinsic spectral information, temporal dependencies, and
cross-depth interactions. To address these limitations, a new hyperspectral
object tracking network equipped with Mamba (HyMamba), is proposed. It unifies
spectral, cross-depth, and temporal modeling through state space modules
(SSMs). The core of HyMamba lies in the Spectral State Integration (SSI)
module, which enables progressive refinement and propagation of spectral
features with cross-depth and temporal spectral information. Embedded within
each SSI, the Hyperspectral Mamba (HSM) module is introduced to learn spatial
and spectral information synchronously via three directional scanning SSMs.
Based on SSI and HSM, HyMamba constructs joint features from false-color and
hyperspectral inputs, and enhances them through interaction with original
spectral features extracted from raw hyperspectral images. Extensive
experiments conducted on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyMamba
achieves state-of-the-art performance. For instance, it achieves 73.0\% of the
AUC score and 96.3\% of the DP@20 score on the HOTC2020 dataset. The code will
be released at https://github.com/lgao001/HyMamba.

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型在处理精确视觉问题时存在明显的偏见依赖问题，需要开发更好的方法来表征和改善这种变化行为。

Abstract: Recent research on Vision Language Models (VLMs) suggests that they rely on
inherent biases learned during training to respond to questions about visual
properties of an image. These biases are exacerbated when VLMs are asked highly
specific questions that require focusing on specific areas of the image. For
example, a VLM tasked with counting stars on a modified American flag (e.g.,
with more than 50 stars) will often disregard the visual evidence and fail to
answer accurately. We build upon this research and develop a multi-dimensional
examination framework to systematically determine which characteristics of the
input data, including both the image and the accompanying prompt, lead to such
differences in performance. Using open-source VLMs, we further examine how
attention values fluctuate with varying input parameters (e.g., image size,
number of objects in the image, background color, prompt specificity). This
research aims to learn how the behavior of vision language models changes and
to explore methods for characterizing such changes. Our results suggest, among
other things, that even minor modifications in image characteristics and prompt
specificity can lead to large changes in how a VLM formulates its answer and,
subsequently, its overall performance.

Conclusion: E3DPC-GZSL通过不确定性估计和语义空间优化，有效解决了3D点云零样本分割中的过拟合问题，无需为已见和未见数据使用单独的分类器。

Abstract: Generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds aims to
classify each point into both seen and unseen classes. A significant challenge
with these models is their tendency to make biased predictions, often favoring
the classes encountered during training. This problem is more pronounced in 3D
applications, where the scale of the training data is typically smaller than in
image-based tasks. To address this problem, we propose a novel method called
E3DPC-GZSL, which reduces overconfident predictions towards seen classes
without relying on separate classifiers for seen and unseen data. E3DPC-GZSL
tackles the overconfidence problem by integrating an evidence-based uncertainty
estimator into a classifier. This estimator is then used to adjust prediction
probabilities using a dynamic calibrated stacking factor that accounts for
pointwise prediction uncertainty. In addition, E3DPC-GZSL introduces a novel
training strategy that improves uncertainty estimation by refining the semantic
space. This is achieved by merging learnable parameters with text-derived
features, thereby improving model optimization for unseen data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation datasets, including
ScanNet v2 and S3DIS.

Motivation: 现有的弱监督物体检测方法存在三个主要问题：1）伪真实框要么只覆盖区别性部分，要么无法区分相邻的同类实例；2）WSDDN网络缺乏背景类表征且分支间语义间隔大；3）忽略建议框导致收敛慢。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法有效解决了弱监督物体检测中的关键挑战，在伪真实框生成、网络设计和优化策略方面都取得了显著改进，为该领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) has attracted significant attention
in recent years, as it does not require box-level annotations. State-of-the-art
methods generally adopt a multi-module network, which employs WSDDN as the
multiple instance detection network module and multiple instance refinement
modules to refine performance. However, these approaches suffer from three key
limitations. First, existing methods tend to generate pseudo GT boxes that
either focus only on discriminative parts, failing to capture the whole object,
or cover the entire object but fail to distinguish between adjacent intra-class
instances. Second, the foundational WSDDN architecture lacks a crucial
background class representation for each proposal and exhibits a large semantic
gap between its branches. Third, prior methods discard ignored proposals during
optimization, leading to slow convergence. To address these challenges, we
first design a heatmap-guided proposal selector (HGPS) algorithm, which
utilizes dual thresholds on heatmaps to pre-select proposals, enabling pseudo
GT boxes to both capture the full object extent and distinguish between
adjacent intra-class instances. We then present a weakly supervised basic
detection network (WSBDN), which augments each proposal with a background class
representation and uses heatmaps for pre-supervision to bridge the semantic gap
between matrices. At last, we introduce a negative certainty supervision loss
on ignored proposals to accelerate convergence. Extensive experiments on the
challenging PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our framework. We achieve mAP/mCorLoc scores of 58.5%/81.8% on VOC 2007 and
55.6%/80.5% on VOC 2012, performing favorably against the state-of-the-art WSOD
methods. Our code is publicly available at

ensured through multi-interpreter consensus and field validation. The dataset
was created using wall-to-wall digitization over large grids, making it

Abstract: Medical vision-language pre-training shows great potential in learning
representative features from massive paired radiographs and reports. However,
in computed tomography (CT) scans, the distribution of lesions which contain
intricate structures is characterized by spatial sparsity. Besides, the complex
and implicit relationships between different pathological descriptions in each
sentence of the report and their corresponding sub-regions in radiographs pose
additional challenges. In this paper, we propose a Similarity-Driven
Cross-Granularity Pre-training (SimCroP) framework on chest CTs, which combines
similarity-driven alignment and cross-granularity fusion to improve radiograph
interpretation. We first leverage multi-modal masked modeling to optimize the
encoder for understanding precise low-level semantics from radiographs. Then,
similarity-driven alignment is designed to pre-train the encoder to adaptively
select and align the correct patches corresponding to each sentence in reports.
The cross-granularity fusion module integrates multimodal information across
instance level and word-patch level, which helps the model better capture key
pathology structures in sparse radiographs, resulting in improved performance
for multi-scale downstream tasks. SimCroP is pre-trained on a large-scale
paired CT-reports dataset and validated on image classification and
segmentation tasks across five public datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that SimCroP outperforms both cutting-edge medical self-supervised
learning methods and medical vision-language pre-training methods. Codes and
models are available at https://github.com/ToniChopp/SimCroP.

Motivation: 解决早期退出策略中存在的协方差偏移问题，即训练时下游分支处理全部样本，而推理时只处理较难的未退出样本，这种不匹配限制了效率-精度的权衡

Method: 提出Boosted Training Scheme for Early Exits (BTS-EE)顺序训练方法，每个分支在下一个分支之前进行训练和校准；设计基于1D卷积的轻量级分支架构；提出Class Precision Margin (CPM)校准方法实现逐类阈值调优

Result: 在CINIC-10数据集上使用ResNet18骨干网络，BTS-EE在64种配置下均优于非增强训练，计算量减少高达45%，精度仅下降2%

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了CNN在实时图像处理系统中的部署设计空间，为工业检测、嵌入式视觉和无人机监控等应用提供了实用的效率提升

Abstract: Real-time image classification on resource-constrained platforms demands
inference methods that balance accuracy with strict latency and power budgets.
Early-exit strategies address this need by attaching auxiliary classifiers to
intermediate layers of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), allowing "easy"
samples to terminate inference early. However, conventional training of early
exits introduces a covariance shift: downstream branches are trained on full
datasets, while at inference they process only the harder, non-exited samples.
This mismatch limits efficiency--accuracy trade-offs in practice. We introduce
the Boosted Training Scheme for Early Exits (BTS-EE), a sequential training
approach that aligns branch training with inference-time data distributions.
Each branch is trained and calibrated before the next, ensuring robustness
under selective inference conditions. To further support embedded deployment,
we propose a lightweight branch architecture based on 1D convolutions and a
Class Precision Margin (CPM) calibration method that enables per-class
threshold tuning for reliable exit decisions. Experiments on the CINIC-10
dataset with a ResNet18 backbone demonstrate that BTS-EE consistently
outperforms non-boosted training across 64 configurations, achieving up to 45
percent reduction in computation with only 2 percent accuracy degradation.
These results expand the design space for deploying CNNs in real-time image
processing systems, offering practical efficiency gains for applications such
as industrial inspection, embedded vision, and UAV-based monitoring.

Abstract: Accurate and early diagnosis of malignant melanoma is critical for improving
patient outcomes. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promise
in dermoscopic image analysis, they often neglect clinical metadata and require
extensive preprocessing. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer a multimodal
alternative but struggle to capture clinical specificity when trained on
general-domain data. To address this, we propose a retrieval-augmented VLM
framework that incorporates semantically similar patient cases into the

and significantly improves classification accuracy and error correction over
conventional baselines. These results demonstrate that retrieval-augmented
prompting provides a robust strategy for clinical decision support.

Abstract: Three-dimensional Object Detection from multi-view cameras and LiDAR is a
crucial component for autonomous driving and smart transportation. However, in
the process of basic feature extraction, perspective transformation, and
feature fusion, noise and error will gradually accumulate. To address this
issue, we propose InsFusion, which can extract proposals from both raw and
fused features and utilizes these proposals to query the raw features, thereby
mitigating the impact of accumulated errors. Additionally, by incorporating
attention mechanisms applied to the raw features, it thereby mitigates the
impact of accumulated errors. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate
that InsFusion is compatible with various advanced baseline methods and
delivers new state-of-the-art performance for 3D object detection.

Motivation: 解决视频数据中动态运动与静态内容的解耦问题，提出比以往方法偏课偏少的自盛学习方案

Method: 采用Transformer基础架构，联合生成帧级运动特征和剧情内容特征，通过低比特率向量量化作为信息瓶颈促进解耦，并使用去噪液散模型进行表征学习

Conclusion: 该方法为自盛学习解耦视频表征提供了新视角，对视频分析和生成领域做出了贡献

Abstract: We propose a novel and general framework to disentangle video data into its
dynamic motion and static content components. Our proposed method is a
self-supervised pipeline with less assumptions and inductive biases than
previous works: it utilizes a transformer-based architecture to jointly
generate flexible implicit features for frame-wise motion and clip-wise
content, and incorporates a low-bitrate vector quantization as an information
bottleneck to promote disentanglement and form a meaningful discrete motion
space. The bitrate-controlled latent motion and content are used as conditional
inputs to a denoising diffusion model to facilitate self-supervised
representation learning. We validate our disentangled representation learning
framework on real-world talking head videos with motion transfer and
auto-regressive motion generation tasks. Furthermore, we also show that our
method can generalize to other types of video data, such as pixel sprites of 2D
cartoon characters. Our work presents a new perspective on self-supervised
learning of disentangled video representations, contributing to the broader
field of video analysis and generation.

<details>

Motivation: 现有基于视觉的3D语义占用预测方法通常采用模块化管道，这些模块独立优化或使用预配置输入，导致级联误差。需要一种端到端的监督方法来统一学习过程。

Conclusion: 通过因果损失实现端到端监督，使整个2D到3D转换管道可学习，显著提升了3D语义占用预测的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction is a critical task in 3D vision
that integrates volumetric 3D reconstruction with semantic understanding.
Existing methods, however, often rely on modular pipelines. These modules are
typically optimized independently or use pre-configured inputs, leading to
cascading errors. In this paper, we address this limitation by designing a
novel causal loss that enables holistic, end-to-end supervision of the modular
2D-to-3D transformation pipeline. Grounded in the principle of 2D-to-3D
semantic causality, this loss regulates the gradient flow from 3D voxel
representations back to the 2D features. Consequently, it renders the entire
pipeline differentiable, unifying the learning process and making previously
non-trainable components fully learnable. Building on this principle, we
propose the Semantic Causality-Aware 2D-to-3D Transformation, which comprises
three components guided by our causal loss: Channel-Grouped Lifting for
adaptive semantic mapping, Learnable Camera Offsets for enhanced robustness
against camera perturbations, and Normalized Convolution for effective feature
propagation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the Occ3D benchmark, demonstrating significant
robustness to camera perturbations and improved 2D-to-3D semantic consistency.

TL;DR: 通过纵向殊切自动编码器(VRAE)架构，在车牌识别中实现更好的图像增强效果，在参数仅增加1%的情况下PSNR提高20%、NMSE降低50%、SSIM提高1%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际交通监控中，车辆图像受到恼劣天气、光照不良、高速运动影响，导致严重噪声和模糊，降低车牌识别精度，需要快速实时图像恢复技术

Method: 提出纵向殊切自动编码器(VRAE)架构，通过辅助块在每个编码阶段注入输入相关特征，指导表征学习过程，比传统自动编码器更好保保一般信息

Result: 在车辆图像数据集上表现超过AE、GAN和流基方法，相比同深度AE，PSNR提高约20%，NMSE降低约50%，SSIM提高1%，参数仅增加约1%

Conclusion: VRAE方法能够在参数效率很高的情况下，显著提升恼劣条件下车牌图像的恢复质量，为实时车牌识别系统提供了有效的前置处理方案

Abstract: In real-world traffic surveillance, vehicle images captured under adverse
weather, poor lighting, or high-speed motion often suffer from severe noise and
blur. Such degradations significantly reduce the accuracy of license plate
recognition systems, especially when the plate occupies only a small region
within the full vehicle image. Restoring these degraded images a fast realtime
manner is thus a crucial pre-processing step to enhance recognition
performance. In this work, we propose a Vertical Residual Autoencoder (VRAE)
architecture designed for the image enhancement task in traffic surveillance.
The method incorporates an enhancement strategy that employs an auxiliary
block, which injects input-aware features at each encoding stage to guide the
representation learning process, enabling better general information
preservation throughout the network compared to conventional autoencoders.
Experiments on a vehicle image dataset with visible license plates demonstrate
that our method consistently outperforms Autoencoder (AE), Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN), and Flow-Based (FB) approaches. Compared with AE at
the same depth, it improves PSNR by about 20\%, reduces NMSE by around 50\%,
and enhances SSIM by 1\%, while requiring only a marginal increase of roughly
1\% in parameters.

TL;DR: SCFusion是一个多视角多目标跟踪框架，通过稀疏变换、密度感知加权和多视角一致性损失来解决BEV投影中的特征失真和密度不均问题，在WildTrack和MultiviewX数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视角多目标跟踪中，由于视角变化、光照变化和遮挡等因素，跨摄像头保持一致的物体身份具有挑战性。传统的BEV投影方法会导致特征失真和非均匀密度问题，降低检测和跟踪精度。

Method: 提出SCFusion框架，包含三个关键技术：1）稀疏变换避免投影中的非自然插值；2）密度感知加权基于空间置信度和相机距离自适应融合特征；3）多视角一致性损失促使每个摄像头在融合前学习判别性特征。

Result: 在WildTrack数据集上达到95.9%的IDF1分数，在MultiviewX数据集上达到89.2%的MODP分数，超越了基准方法TrackTacular，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SCFusion有效缓解了传统BEV投影的限制，为多视角物体检测和跟踪提供了鲁棒且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-View Multi-Object Tracking (MVMOT) is essential for applications such
as surveillance, autonomous driving, and sports analytics. However, maintaining
consistent object identities across multiple cameras remains challenging due to
viewpoint changes, lighting variations, and occlusions, which often lead to
tracking errors.Recent methods project features from multiple cameras into a
unified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) space to improve robustness against occlusion.
However, this projection introduces feature distortion and non-uniform density
caused by variations in object scale with distance. These issues degrade the
quality of the fused representation and reduce detection and tracking
accuracy.To address these problems, we propose SCFusion, a framework that
combines three techniques to improve multi-view feature integration. First, it
applies a sparse transformation to avoid unnatural interpolation during
projection. Next, it performs density-aware weighting to adaptively fuse
features based on spatial confidence and camera distance. Finally, it
introduces a multi-view consistency loss that encourages each camera to learn
discriminative features independently before fusion.Experiments show that
SCFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching an IDF1 score of 95.9%
on WildTrack and a MODP of 89.2% on MultiviewX, outperforming the baseline
method TrackTacular. These results demonstrate that SCFusion effectively
mitigates the limitations of conventional BEV projection and provides a robust
and accurate solution for multi-view object detection and tracking.

TL;DR: LD-ViCE是一个基于潜在扩散模型的视频反事实解释框架，通过在潜在空间中操作降低计算成本，同时生成真实且可解释的反事实解释，在三个视频数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频AI系统在安全关键领域应用广泛，但现有解释技术存在时间连贯性不足、鲁棒性差、缺乏因果洞察等问题，且现有反事实解释方法通常不包含目标模型指导，降低了语义保真度和实用性。

Method: LD-ViCE使用最先进的扩散模型在潜在空间中操作，通过额外的细化步骤生成真实且可解释的反事实解释，显著降低了生成解释的计算成本。

Result: 在EchoNet-Dynamic、FERV39k和Something-Something V2三个视频数据集上，LD-ViCE优于现有最先进方法，R2分数提升高达68%，同时推理时间减少一半。定性分析确认其生成语义有意义且时间连贯的解释。

Conclusion: LD-ViCE代表了在安全关键领域可信AI部署的重要进展，为理解视频AI模型行为提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Video-based AI systems are increasingly adopted in safety-critical domains
such as autonomous driving and healthcare. However, interpreting their
decisions remains challenging due to the inherent spatiotemporal complexity of
video data and the opacity of deep learning models. Existing explanation
techniques often suffer from limited temporal coherence, insufficient
robustness, and a lack of actionable causal insights. Current counterfactual
explanation methods typically do not incorporate guidance from the target
model, reducing semantic fidelity and practical utility. We introduce Latent
Diffusion for Video Counterfactual Explanations (LD-ViCE), a novel framework
designed to explain the behavior of video-based AI models. Compared to previous
approaches, LD-ViCE reduces the computational costs of generating explanations
by operating in latent space using a state-of-the-art diffusion model, while
producing realistic and interpretable counterfactuals through an additional
refinement step. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LD-ViCE
across three diverse video datasets, including EchoNet-Dynamic (cardiac
ultrasound), FERV39k (facial expression), and Something-Something V2 (action
recognition). LD-ViCE outperforms a recent state-of-the-art method, achieving
an increase in R2 score of up to 68% while reducing inference time by half.
Qualitative analysis confirms that LD-ViCE generates semantically meaningful
and temporally coherent explanations, offering valuable insights into the
target model behavior. LD-ViCE represents a valuable step toward the
trustworthy deployment of AI in safety-critical domains.

TL;DR: 提出了HyperTTA框架，通过多退化数据集构建、光谱-空间变换器分类器和轻量级测试时适应策略，显著提升了高光谱图像分类模型在各种退化条件下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像分类模型对噪声、模糊、压缩和大气效应等现实世界退化引起的分布偏移高度敏感，需要提高模型在各种退化条件下的鲁棒性。

Method: 1) 构建多退化高光谱数据集模拟9种代表性退化类型；2) 设计光谱-空间变换器分类器(SSTC)，包含多级感受野机制和标签平滑正则化；3) 提出轻量级测试时适应策略CELA，通过最小化高置信度样本的预测熵来更新LayerNorm参数。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的大量实验表明，HyperTTA在广泛的退化场景中优于现有基线方法，验证了其分类主干和TTA方案的有效性。

Conclusion: HyperTTA框架通过系统化的数据集构建、先进的分类器设计和轻量级自适应策略，成功解决了高光谱图像分类中的分布偏移问题，为实际应用提供了鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification models are highly sensitive to
distribution shifts caused by various real-world degradations such as noise,
blur, compression, and atmospheric effects. To address this challenge, we
propose HyperTTA, a unified framework designed to enhance model robustness
under diverse degradation conditions. Specifically, we first construct a
multi-degradation hyperspectral dataset that systematically simulates nine
representative types of degradations, providing a comprehensive benchmark for
robust classification evaluation. Based on this, we design a spectral-spatial
transformer classifier (SSTC) enhanced with a multi-level receptive field
mechanism and label smoothing regularization to jointly capture multi-scale
spatial context and improve generalization. Furthermore, HyperTTA incorporates
a lightweight test-time adaptation (TTA) strategy, the confidence-aware
entropy-minimized LayerNorm adapter (CELA), which updates only the affine
parameters of LayerNorm layers by minimizing prediction entropy on
high-confidence unlabeled target samples. This confidence-aware adaptation
prevents unreliable updates from noisy predictions, enabling robust and dynamic
adaptation without access to source data or target annotations. Extensive
experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyperTTA outperforms
existing baselines across a wide range of degradation scenarios, validating the
effectiveness of both its classification backbone and the proposed TTA scheme.
Code will be made available publicly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测个体化的高分辨率直视皮层厚度轨迹对于检测微妙的直视皮变化和提前干预至关重要，但由于大脑直视皮的复杂非欧几里得几何结构和需要整合多模态数据，这是一项具有挑战性的任务。

Conclusion: SBDM为直视皮厚度轨迹预测提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够在复杂的非欧几里得空间中进行准确的个体化预测，并且具有生成反事实轨迹的潜力，为神经退行性疾病的早期识别和干预提供了新的研究工具。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of individualized, high-resolution cortical thickness
(CTh) trajectories is essential for detecting subtle cortical changes,
providing invaluable insights into neurodegenerative processes and facilitating
earlier and more precise intervention strategies. However, CTh forecasting is a
challenging task due to the intricate non-Euclidean geometry of the cerebral
cortex and the need to integrate multi-modal data for subject-specific
predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce the Spherical Brownian
Bridge Diffusion Model (SBDM). Specifically, we propose a bidirectional
conditional Brownian bridge diffusion process to forecast CTh trajectories at
the vertex level of registered cortical surfaces. Our technical contribution
includes a new denoising model, the conditional spherical U-Net (CoS-UNet),
which combines spherical convolutions and dense cross-attention to integrate
cortical surfaces and tabular conditions seamlessly. Compared to previous
approaches, SBDM achieves significantly reduced prediction errors, as
demonstrated by our experiments based on longitudinal datasets from the ADNI
and OASIS. Additionally, we demonstrate SBDM's ability to generate individual
factual and counterfactual CTh trajectories, offering a novel framework for
exploring hypothetical scenarios of cortical development.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数基于Mamba的视觉模型主要关注网络架构和扫描路径，而对SSM模块本身关注较少。为了探索SSM的潜力，需要改进SSM计算过程以提升轻量级超分辨率任务的性能。

Method: 引入一阶状态空间模型(FSSM)，在SSM中应用一阶保持条件，推导新的离散化形式，并分析累积误差，通过融入token相关性来增强原始Mamba模块。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，FSSM在不额外增加参数量的情况下提升了MambaIR的性能，超越了当前的轻量级超分辨率方法，达到了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: FSSM通过改进SSM模块的计算过程，有效提升了轻量级超分辨率任务的性能，证明了在SSM模块本身进行优化的重要性，为后续研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: State space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have shown promise in NLP
tasks and are increasingly applied to vision tasks. However, most Mamba-based
vision models focus on network architecture and scan paths, with little
attention to the SSM module. In order to explore the potential of SSMs, we
modified the calculation process of SSM without increasing the number of
parameters to improve the performance on lightweight super-resolution tasks. In
this paper, we introduce the First-order State Space Model (FSSM) to improve
the original Mamba module, enhancing performance by incorporating token
correlations. We apply a first-order hold condition in SSMs, derive the new
discretized form, and analyzed cumulative error. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that FSSM improves the performance of MambaIR on five benchmark
datasets without additionally increasing the number of parameters, and
surpasses current lightweight SR methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: 多模态特定策略对评估器校准至关重要，MMB为可靠的大规模TTI评估提供了有前景的解决方案

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate
text-to-image (TTI) generation systems, providing automated judgments based on
visual and textual context. However, these "judge" models often suffer from
biases, overconfidence, and inconsistent performance across diverse image
domains. While prompt ensembling has shown promise for mitigating these issues
in unimodal, text-only settings, our experiments reveal that standard
ensembling methods fail to generalize effectively for TTI tasks. To address
these limitations, we propose a new multimodal-aware method called Multimodal
Mixture-of-Bayesian Prompt Ensembles (MMB). Our method uses a Bayesian prompt
ensemble approach augmented by image clustering, allowing the judge to
dynamically assign prompt weights based on the visual characteristics of each
sample. We show that MMB improves accuracy in pairwise preference judgments and
greatly enhances calibration, making it easier to gauge the judge's true
uncertainty. In evaluations on two TTI benchmarks, HPSv2 and MJBench, MMB
outperforms existing baselines in alignment with human annotations and
calibration across varied image content. Our findings highlight the importance
of multimodal-specific strategies for judge calibration and suggest a promising
path forward for reliable large-scale TTI evaluation.

Abstract: The robustness of contrastive self-supervised learning (CSSL) for imbalanced
datasets is largely unexplored. CSSL usually makes use of \emph{multi-view}
assumptions to learn discriminatory features via similar and dissimilar data
samples. CSSL works well on balanced datasets, but does not generalize well for
imbalanced datasets. In a very recent paper, as part of future work, Yann LeCun
pointed out that the self-supervised multiview framework can be extended to
cases involving \emph{more than two views}. Taking a cue from this insight we
propose a theoretical justification based on the concept of \emph{mutual
information} to support the \emph{more than two views} objective and apply it
to the problem of dataset imbalance in self-supervised learning. The proposed
method helps extract representative characteristics of the tail classes by
segregating between \emph{intra} and \emph{inter} discriminatory
characteristics. We introduce a loss function that helps us to learn better
representations by filtering out extreme features. Experimental evaluation on a
variety of self-supervised frameworks (both contrastive and non-contrastive)
also prove that the \emph{more than two view} objective works well for
imbalanced datasets. We achieve a new state-of-the-art accuracy in
self-supervised imbalanced dataset classification (2\% improvement in
Cifar10-LT using Resnet-18, 5\% improvement in Cifar100-LT using Resnet-18, 3\%
improvement in Imagenet-LT (1k) using Resnet-50).

Abstract: Prompt-driven image analysis converts a single natural-language instruction
into multiple steps: locate, segment, edit, and describe. We present a
practical case study of a unified pipeline that combines open-vocabulary
detection, promptable segmentation, text-conditioned inpainting, and
vision-language description into a single workflow. The system works end to end
from a single prompt, retains intermediate artifacts for transparent debugging
(such as detections, masks, overlays, edited images, and before and after
composites), and provides the same functionality through an interactive UI and
a scriptable CLI for consistent, repeatable runs. We highlight integration
choices that reduce brittleness, including threshold adjustments, mask
inspection with light morphology, and resource-aware defaults. In a small,
single-word prompt segment, detection and segmentation produced usable masks in
over 90% of cases with an accuracy above 85% based on our criteria. On a
high-end GPU, inpainting makes up 60 to 75% of total runtime under typical
guidance and sampling settings, which highlights the need for careful tuning.
The study offers implementation-guided advice on thresholds, mask tightness,
and diffusion parameters, and details version pinning, artifact logging, and
seed control to support replay. Our contribution is a transparent, reliable
pattern for assembling modern vision and multimodal models behind a single
prompt, with clear guardrails and operational practices that improve
reliability in object replacement, scene augmentation, and removal.

Abstract: Underwater object detection (UOD) is vital to diverse marine applications,
including oceanographic research, underwater robotics, and marine conservation.
However, UOD faces numerous challenges that compromise its performance. Over
the years, various methods have been proposed to address these issues, but they
often fail to fully capture the complexities of underwater environments. This
review systematically categorizes UOD challenges into five key areas: Image
quality degradation, target-related issues, data-related challenges,
computational and processing constraints, and limitations in detection
methodologies. To address these challenges, we analyze the progression from
traditional image processing and object detection techniques to modern
approaches. Additionally, we explore the potential of large vision-language
models (LVLMs) in UOD, leveraging their multi-modal capabilities demonstrated
in other domains. We also present case studies, including synthetic dataset
generation using DALL-E 3 and fine-tuning Florence-2 LVLM for UOD. This review
identifies three key insights: (i) Current UOD methods are insufficient to
fully address challenges like image degradation and small object detection in
dynamic underwater environments. (ii) Synthetic data generation using LVLMs
shows potential for augmenting datasets but requires further refinement to
ensure realism and applicability. (iii) LVLMs hold significant promise for UOD,
but their real-time application remains under-explored, requiring further

*Piyush Bagad,Andrew Zisserman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出时间敏感的视频表示方法，通过手性动作识别任务来区分时间上相反的动作，使用自监督方法在冻结图像特征中注入时间敏感性，在多个数据集上优于大型视频模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发对时间视觉变化敏感的视频表示，现有视频嵌入在手性动作识别（如开门vs关门）上表现不佳，需要理解简单的时间变化。

Method: 基于感知拉直启发的自监督适应方法，使用带有归纳偏置的自动编码器潜在空间，在冻结图像特征序列中注入时间敏感性。

Result: 在Something-Something、EPIC-Kitchens和Charade数据集上表现优异，超越大型视频模型，并能提升现有模型在标准基准上的分类性能。

Conclusion: 提出的时间敏感视频表示方法在手性动作识别任务上有效，能够以紧凑的形式捕捉时间变化信息，并与现有模型结合带来性能提升。

Abstract: Our objective is to develop compact video representations that are sensitive
to visual change over time. To measure such time-sensitivity, we introduce a
new task: chiral action recognition, where one needs to distinguish between a
pair of temporally opposite actions, such as "opening vs. closing a door",
"approaching vs. moving away from something", "folding vs. unfolding paper",
etc. Such actions (i) occur frequently in everyday life, (ii) require
understanding of simple visual change over time (in object state, size, spatial
position, count . . . ), and (iii) are known to be poorly represented by many
video embeddings. Our goal is to build time aware video representations which
offer linear separability between these chiral pairs. To that end, we propose a
self-supervised adaptation recipe to inject time-sensitivity into a sequence of
frozen image features. Our model is based on an auto-encoder with a latent
space with inductive bias inspired by perceptual straightening. We show that
this results in a compact but time-sensitive video representation for the
proposed task across three datasets: Something-Something, EPIC-Kitchens, and
Charade. Our method (i) outperforms much larger video models pre-trained on
large-scale video datasets, and (ii) leads to an improvement in classification
performance on standard benchmarks when combined with these existing models.

Conclusion: HuMo成功解决了多模态人类视频生成中的关键挑战，通过创新的数据集构建、训练策略和推理方法，实现了对文本、图像和音频输入的灵活细粒度控制，为统一的多模态人类视频生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Human-Centric Video Generation (HCVG) methods seek to synthesize human videos
from multimodal inputs, including text, image, and audio. Existing methods
struggle to effectively coordinate these heterogeneous modalities due to two
challenges: the scarcity of training data with paired triplet conditions and
the difficulty of collaborating the sub-tasks of subject preservation and
audio-visual sync with multimodal inputs. In this work, we present HuMo, a
unified HCVG framework for collaborative multimodal control. For the first
challenge, we construct a high-quality dataset with diverse and paired text,
reference images, and audio. For the second challenge, we propose a two-stage
progressive multimodal training paradigm with task-specific strategies. For the
subject preservation task, to maintain the prompt following and visual
generation abilities of the foundation model, we adopt the minimal-invasive
image injection strategy. For the audio-visual sync task, besides the commonly
adopted audio cross-attention layer, we propose a focus-by-predicting strategy
that implicitly guides the model to associate audio with facial regions. For
joint learning of controllabilities across multimodal inputs, building on
previously acquired capabilities, we progressively incorporate the audio-visual
sync task. During inference, for flexible and fine-grained multimodal control,
we design a time-adaptive Classifier-Free Guidance strategy that dynamically
adjusts guidance weights across denoising steps. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that HuMo surpasses specialized state-of-the-art methods in
sub-tasks, establishing a unified framework for collaborative
multimodal-conditioned HCVG. Project Page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MESH是一个新的基准测试，用于系统评估大型视频模型(LVMs)的幻觉问题，采用问答框架和自下而上的方法，发现LVMs在处理细节和复杂动作时更容易产生幻觉


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频幻觉基准测试过度依赖人工分类，忽视了人类自然理解视频的感知过程，需要更系统化的评估方法

Method: 使用问答框架（二元和多项选择格式），包含目标和陷阱实例，采用自下而上的方法评估基础对象、粗到细的主题特征以及主题-动作对

Result: LVMs在识别基础对象和特征方面表现优异，但在处理精细细节或对齐涉及多个主题的复杂动作时，幻觉敏感性显著增加

Conclusion: MESH提供了一个有效且全面的方法来识别视频中的幻觉，揭示了LVMs在复杂场景理解方面的局限性

Abstract: Large Video Models (LVMs) build on the semantic capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) and vision modules by integrating temporal information
to better understand dynamic video content. Despite their progress, LVMs are
prone to hallucinations-producing inaccurate or irrelevant descriptions.
Current benchmarks for video hallucination depend heavily on manual
categorization of video content, neglecting the perception-based processes
through which humans naturally interpret videos. We introduce MESH, a benchmark
designed to evaluate hallucinations in LVMs systematically. MESH uses a
Question-Answering framework with binary and multi-choice formats incorporating
target and trap instances. It follows a bottom-up approach, evaluating basic
objects, coarse-to-fine subject features, and subject-action pairs, aligning
with human video understanding. We demonstrate that MESH offers an effective
and comprehensive approach for identifying hallucinations in videos. Our
evaluations show that while LVMs excel at recognizing basic objects and
features, their susceptibility to hallucinations increases markedly when
handling fine details or aligning multiple actions involving various subjects
in longer videos.

TL;DR: 本文提出了ViewSparsifier方法，在植物生长建模挑战赛中通过多视角学习获得了植物年龄预测和叶片计数估计两个任务的最佳成绩


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单视角分类或回归模型无法充分捕捉植物表型特征的所有信息，影响植物健康评估和收获成熟度预测的准确性

Method: 使用多视角数据集，通过随机选择24个视角（选择向量）学习视角不变嵌入，并尝试了跨5个高度级别的随机视角选择（120个视角，选择矩阵）

Result: ViewSparsifier方法在ACM Multimedia 2025的GroMo挑战赛中赢得了植物年龄预测和叶片计数估计两个任务的第一名

Conclusion: 多视角学习方法能有效提升植物表型分析性能，随机视角选择策略是未来研究的有价值方向

Abstract: Plant phenotyping involves analyzing observable characteristics of plants to
better understand their growth, health, and development. In the context of deep
learning, this analysis is often approached through single-view classification
or regression models. However, these methods often fail to capture all
information required for accurate estimation of target phenotypic traits, which
can adversely affect plant health assessment and harvest readiness prediction.
To address this, the Growth Modelling (GroMo) Grand Challenge at ACM Multimedia
2025 provides a multi-view dataset featuring multiple plants and two tasks:
Plant Age Prediction and Leaf Count Estimation. Each plant is photographed from
multiple heights and angles, leading to significant overlap and redundancy in
the captured information. To learn view-invariant embeddings, we incorporate 24
views, referred to as the selection vector, in a random selection. Our
ViewSparsifier approach won both tasks. For further improvement and as a
direction for future research, we also experimented with randomized view
selection across all five height levels (120 views total), referred to as
selection matrices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态模型在自然图像分割中表现优异，但在医学领域表现不佳，主要原因是文本提示与医学视觉特征之间的语义鸿沟以及特征分散问题

Method: 采用期望最大化(EM)聚合机制动态聚类特征到紧凑语义中心，结合文本引导像素解码器利用领域不变文本知识指导深度视觉表示

Result: 在心脏和眼底公共数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在多个域泛化基准测试中 consistently 优于现有SOTA方法

Conclusion: 通过语义聚合视角解决医学多模态分割问题，两种机制的协同作用显著提升了模型的泛化能力

Abstract: Multimodal models have achieved remarkable success in natural image
segmentation, yet they often underperform when applied to the medical domain.
Through extensive study, we attribute this performance gap to the challenges of
multimodal fusion, primarily the significant semantic gap between abstract
textual prompts and fine-grained medical visual features, as well as the
resulting feature dispersion. To address these issues, we revisit the problem
from the perspective of semantic aggregation. Specifically, we propose an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) Aggregation mechanism and a Text-Guided Pixel
Decoder. The former mitigates feature dispersion by dynamically clustering
features into compact semantic centers to enhance cross-modal correspondence.
The latter is designed to bridge the semantic gap by leveraging
domain-invariant textual knowledge to effectively guide deep visual
representations. The synergy between these two mechanisms significantly
improves the model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments on public
cardiac and fundus datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing SOTA approaches across multiple domain generalization
benchmarks.

Motivation: 格陵兰冰盖下地形的精确测绘对海平面预测至关重要，但雷达观测数据稀疏且分布不均，需要开发能够处理数据缺失和不确定性的新方法。

Conclusion: GraphTopoNet展示了图机器学习如何将稀疏、不确定的地球物理观测转化为大陆尺度的可操作知识，提高了操作建模的可靠性，支持气候预测和政策制定。

Abstract: Accurate maps of Greenland's subglacial bed are essential for sea-level
projections, but radar observations are sparse and uneven. We introduce
GraphTopoNet, a graph-learning framework that fuses heterogeneous supervision
and explicitly models uncertainty via Monte Carlo dropout. Spatial graphs built
from surface observables (elevation, velocity, mass balance) are augmented with
gradient features and polynomial trends to capture both local variability and
broad structure. To handle data gaps, we employ a hybrid loss that combines
confidence-weighted radar supervision with dynamically balanced regularization.
Applied to three Greenland subregions, GraphTopoNet outperforms interpolation,
convolutional, and graph-based baselines, reducing error by up to 60 percent
while preserving fine-scale glacial features. The resulting bed maps improve
reliability for operational modeling, supporting agencies engaged in climate
forecasting and policy. More broadly, GraphTopoNet shows how graph machine
learning can convert sparse, uncertain geophysical observations into actionable
knowledge at continental scale.

Conclusion: 该方法能够显著减轻医疗人员的手动分割工作负荷，通过稀疏注释实现整体体积分割，为复杂医学分割任务提供了高效的辅助解决方案

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to significantly reduce the manual workload
required from medical professionals in complex 3D segmentation tasks that
cannot be yet fully automated. For instance, in radiotherapy planning, organs
at risk must be accurately identified in computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) scans to ensure they are spared from harmful radiation.
Similarly, diagnosing age-related degenerative diseases such as sarcopenia,
which involve progressive muscle volume loss and strength, is commonly based on
muscular mass measurements often obtained from manual segmentation of medical
volumes. To alleviate the manual-segmentation burden, this paper introduces an
implicit shape prior to segment volumes from sparse slice manual annotations
generalized to the multi-organ case, along with a simple framework for
automatically selecting the most informative slices to guide and minimize the
next interactions. The experimental validation shows the method's effectiveness
on two medical use cases: assisted segmentation in the context of at risks
organs for brain cancer patients, and acceleration of the creation of a new
database with unseen muscle shapes for patients with sarcopenia.

Abstract: With imaging devices delivering ever-higher resolutions and the emerging
diffusion-based forgery methods, current detectors trained only on traditional
datasets (with splicing, copy-moving and object removal forgeries) lack
exposure to this new manipulation type. To address this, we propose a novel
high-resolution SIF dataset of 1200+ diffusion-generated manipulations with
semantically extracted masks. However, this also imposes a challenge on
existing methods, as they face significant computational resource constraints
due to their prohibitive computational complexities. Therefore, we propose a
novel EfficientIML model with a lightweight, three-stage EfficientRWKV
backbone. EfficientRWKV's hybrid state-space and attention network captures
global context and local details in parallel, while a multi-scale supervision
strategy enforces consistency across hierarchical predictions. Extensive
evaluations on our dataset and standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach outperforms ViT-based and other SOTA lightweight baselines in
localization performance, FLOPs and inference speed, underscoring its
suitability for real-time forensic applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model
(SAM), have significantly impacted medical image segmentation, especially in
retinal imaging, where precise segmentation is vital for diagnosis. Despite
this progress, current methods face critical challenges: 1) modality ambiguity
in textual disease descriptions, 2) a continued reliance on manual prompting
for SAM-based workflows, and 3) a lack of a unified framework, with most
methods being modality- and task-specific. To overcome these hurdles, we
propose CLIP-unified Auto-Prompt Segmentation (\CLAPS), a novel method for
unified segmentation across diverse tasks and modalities in retinal imaging.
Our approach begins by pre-training a CLIP-based image encoder on a large,
multi-modal retinal dataset to handle data scarcity and distribution imbalance.
We then leverage GroundingDINO to automatically generate spatial bounding box
prompts by detecting local lesions. To unify tasks and resolve ambiguity, we
use text prompts enhanced with a unique "modality signature" for each imaging
modality. Ultimately, these automated textual and spatial prompts guide SAM to
execute precise segmentation, creating a fully automated and unified pipeline.
Extensive experiments on 12 diverse datasets across 11 critical segmentation
categories show that CLAPS achieves performance on par with specialized expert
models while surpassing existing benchmarks across most metrics, demonstrating
its broad generalizability as a foundation model.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have taken a great step towards AGI. Meanwhile,
an increasing number of domain-specific problems such as math and programming
boost these general-purpose models to continuously evolve via learning deeper
expertise. Now is thus the time further to extend the diversity of specialized
applications for knowledgeable LLMs, though collecting high quality data with
unexpected and informative tasks is challenging. In this paper, we propose to
use advertisement (ad) videos as a challenging test-bed to probe the ability of
LLMs in perceiving beyond the objective physical content of common visual
domain. Our motivation is to take full advantage of the clue-rich and
information-dense ad videos' traits, e.g., marketing logic, persuasive
strategies, and audience engagement. Our contribution is three-fold: (1) To our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to use ad videos with well-designed tasks
to evaluate LLMs. We contribute AdsQA, a challenging ad Video QA benchmark
derived from 1,544 ad videos with 10,962 clips, totaling 22.7 hours, providing
5 challenging tasks. (2) We propose ReAd-R, a Deepseek-R1 styled RL model that
reflects on questions, and generates answers via reward-driven optimization.
(3) We benchmark 14 top-tier LLMs on AdsQA, and our \texttt{ReAd-R}~achieves
the state-of-the-art outperforming strong competitors equipped with long-chain

Abstract: Significant advancements in AI-driven multimodal medical image diagnosis have
led to substantial improvements in ophthalmic disease identification in recent
years. However, acquiring paired multimodal ophthalmic images remains
prohibitively expensive. While fundus photography is simple and cost-effective,
the limited availability of OCT data and inherent modality imbalance hinder
further progress. Conventional approaches that rely solely on fundus or textual
features often fail to capture fine-grained spatial information, as each
imaging modality provides distinct cues about lesion predilection sites. In
this study, we propose a novel unpaired multimodal framework \UOPSL that
utilizes extensive OCT-derived spatial priors to dynamically identify
predilection sites, enhancing fundus image-based disease recognition. Our
approach bridges unpaired fundus and OCTs via extended disease text
descriptions. Initially, we employ contrastive learning on a large corpus of
unpaired OCT and fundus images while simultaneously learning the predilection
sites matrix in the OCT latent space. Through extensive optimization, this
matrix captures lesion localization patterns within the OCT feature space.
During the fine-tuning or inference phase of the downstream classification task
based solely on fundus images, where paired OCT data is unavailable, we
eliminate OCT input and utilize the predilection sites matrix to assist in
fundus image classification learning. Extensive experiments conducted on 9
diverse datasets across 28 critical categories demonstrate that our framework
outperforms existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: LADB为现实世界域转换提供了一个可扩展且通用的解决方案，特别适用于数据标注成本高或不完整的场景。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating high-quality outputs but face challenges
in data-scarce domains, where exhaustive retraining or costly paired data are
often required. To address these limitations, we propose Latent Aligned
Diffusion Bridges (LADB), a semi-supervised framework for sample-to-sample
translation that effectively bridges domain gaps using partially paired data.
By aligning source and target distributions within a shared latent space, LADB
seamlessly integrates pretrained source-domain diffusion models with a
target-domain Latent Aligned Diffusion Model (LADM), trained on partially
paired latent representations. This approach enables deterministic domain
mapping without the need for full supervision. Compared to unpaired methods,
which often lack controllability, and fully paired approaches that require
large, domain-specific datasets, LADB strikes a balance between fidelity and
diversity by leveraging a mixture of paired and unpaired latent-target
couplings. Our experimental results demonstrate superior performance in
depth-to-image translation under partial supervision. Furthermore, we extend
LADB to handle multi-source translation (from depth maps and segmentation
masks) and multi-target translation in a class-conditioned style transfer task,
showcasing its versatility in handling diverse and heterogeneous use cases.
Ultimately, we present LADB as a scalable and versatile solution for real-world
domain translation, particularly in scenarios where data annotation is costly
or incomplete.

Conclusion: DSLNet通过双参考系和双流架构有效解决了手语识别中的几何模糊性问题，在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能

Abstract: Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) is challenged by gestures that are
morphologically similar yet semantically distinct, a problem rooted in the
complex interplay between hand shape and motion trajectory. Existing methods,
often relying on a single reference frame, struggle to resolve this geometric
ambiguity. This paper introduces Dual-SignLanguageNet (DSLNet), a
dual-reference, dual-stream architecture that decouples and models gesture
morphology and trajectory in separate, complementary coordinate systems. Our
approach utilizes a wrist-centric frame for view-invariant shape analysis and a
facial-centric frame for context-aware trajectory modeling. These streams are
processed by specialized networks-a topology-aware graph convolution for shape
and a Finsler geometry-based encoder for trajectory-and are integrated via a
geometry-driven optimal transport fusion mechanism. DSLNet sets a new
state-of-the-art, achieving 93.70%, 89.97% and 99.79% accuracy on the

Method: 提出分形变形网络(FDN)，采用递归编码器-解码器嵌套结构和跳跃连接，替代传统CNN的序列下采样。训练目标基于变分公式，结合L1和L2数据保真度项保证亮度恒定性，以及TV正则化项促进空间平滑性和连贯流场。

Result: 在合成和基准数据集上的实验表明，FractalPINN-Flow能够产生准确、平滑且保持边缘的光流场。该模型特别适用于高分辨率数据和标注有限的场景，表现出色。

Conclusion: FractalPINN-Flow成功地将分形几何思想与变分公式相结合，为无监督光流估计提供了有效解决方案，特别是在高分辨率和标注稀缺场景下具有显著优势。

Abstract: We present FractalPINN-Flow, an unsupervised deep learning framework for
dense optical flow estimation that learns directly from consecutive grayscale
frames without requiring ground truth. The architecture centers on the Fractal
Deformation Network (FDN) - a recursive encoder-decoder inspired by fractal
geometry and self-similarity. Unlike traditional CNNs with sequential
downsampling, FDN uses repeated encoder-decoder nesting with skip connections
to capture both fine-grained details and long-range motion patterns. The
training objective is based on a classical variational formulation using total
variation (TV) regularization. Specifically, we minimize an energy functional
that combines $L^1$ and $L^2$ data fidelity terms to enforce brightness
constancy, along with a TV term that promotes spatial smoothness and coherent
flow fields. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets show that
FractalPINN-Flow produces accurate, smooth, and edge-preserving optical flow
fields. The model is especially effective for high-resolution data and
scenarios with limited annotations.

Abstract: Coastal water segmentation from satellite imagery presents unique challenges
due to complex spectral characteristics and irregular boundary patterns.
Traditional RGB-based approaches often suffer from training instability and
poor generalization in diverse maritime environments. This paper introduces a
systematic robust enhancement framework, referred to as Robust U-Net, that
leverages HSV color space supervision and multi-modal constraints for improved
coastal water segmentation. Our approach integrates five synergistic
components: HSV-guided color supervision, gradient-based coastline
optimization, morphological post-processing, sea area cleanup, and connectivity
control. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that HSV
supervision provides the highest impact (0.85 influence score), while the
complete framework achieves superior training stability (84\% variance
reduction) and enhanced segmentation quality. Our method shows consistent
improvements across multiple evaluation metrics while maintaining computational
efficiency. For reproducibility, our training configurations and code are

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive survey of computational imaging (CI)
techniques and their transformative impact on computer vision (CV)
applications. Conventional imaging methods often fail to deliver high-fidelity
visual data in challenging conditions, such as low light, motion blur, or high
dynamic range scenes, thereby limiting the performance of state-of-the-art CV
systems. Computational imaging techniques, including light field imaging, high
dynamic range (HDR) imaging, deblurring, high-speed imaging, and glare
mitigation, address these limitations by enhancing image acquisition and
reconstruction processes. This survey systematically explores the synergies
between CI techniques and core CV tasks, including object detection, depth
estimation, optical flow, face recognition, and keypoint detection. By
analyzing the relationships between CI methods and their practical
contributions to CV applications, this work highlights emerging opportunities,
challenges, and future research directions. We emphasize the potential for
task-specific, adaptive imaging pipelines that improve robustness, accuracy,
and efficiency in real-world scenarios, such as autonomous navigation,
surveillance, augmented reality, and robotics.

Conclusion: BcQLM为实际硬件约束下的MLLM部署提供了有前景的解决方案，在准确性和效率之间完美平衡，具有良好的可扩展性

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) advance, their large-scale
architectures pose challenges for deployment in resource-constrained
environments. In the age of large models, where energy efficiency,
computational scalability and environmental sustainability are paramount, the
development of lightweight and high-performance models is critical for
real-world applications. As such, we propose a lightweight MLLM framework for
end-to-end visual question answering. Our proposed approach centres on
BreezeCLIP, a compact yet powerful vision-language encoder optimised for
efficient multimodal understanding. With only 1.2 billion parameters overall,
our model significantly reduces computational cost while achieving performance
comparable to standard-size MLLMs. Experiments conducted on multiple datasets
further validate its effectiveness in balancing accuracy and efficiency. The
modular and extensible design enables generalisation to broader multimodal
tasks. The proposed lightweight vision-language framework is denoted as BcQLM
(BreezeCLIP-enhanced Q-Gated Multimodal Language Model). It offers a promising
path toward deployable MLLMs under practical hardware constraints. The source

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CrowdQuery (CQ) 是一种新颖的端到端人群检测方法，通过预测和嵌入物体密度图来增强基于transformer的检测器，在2D和3D拥挤场景检测中均取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的密度图定义通常依赖于头部位置或基于物体的空间统计信息，缺乏对个体边界框维度的考虑。需要一种能够有效处理拥挤场景并统一2D和3D检测的方法。

Method: 提出CQ模块，预测并嵌入物体密度图，将密度信息系统性地集成到解码器中。通过密度引导的查询来改进拥挤场景中的检测，设计了CQ2D和CQ3D架构。

Result: 在STCrowd数据集上，2D和3D领域均显示出相比基础模型的显著性能提升，优于大多数最先进方法。在CrowdHuman数据集上也能进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: CQ是首个有效桥接2D和3D拥挤环境检测的方法，具有通用性，不限于特定transformer模型，且无需额外数据即可应用于2D和3D检测。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for end-to-end crowd detection that
leverages object density information to enhance existing transformer-based
detectors. We present CrowdQuery (CQ), whose core component is our CQ module
that predicts and subsequently embeds an object density map. The embedded
density information is then systematically integrated into the decoder.
Existing density map definitions typically depend on head positions or
object-based spatial statistics. Our method extends these definitions to
include individual bounding box dimensions. By incorporating density
information into object queries, our method utilizes density-guided queries to
improve detection in crowded scenes. CQ is universally applicable to both 2D
and 3D detection without requiring additional data. Consequently, we are the
first to design a method that effectively bridges 2D and 3D detection in
crowded environments. We demonstrate the integration of CQ into both a general
2D and 3D transformer-based object detector, introducing the architectures CQ2D
and CQ3D. CQ is not limited to the specific transformer models we selected.
Experiments on the STCrowd dataset for both 2D and 3D domains show significant
performance improvements compared to the base models, outperforming most
state-of-the-art methods. When integrated into a state-of-the-art crowd
detector, CQ can further improve performance on the challenging CrowdHuman
dataset, demonstrating its generalizability. The code is released at
https://github.com/mdaehl/CrowdQuery.

TL;DR: ArgoTweak是首个提供真实地图先验、当前地图和传感器数据三元组的公开数据集，通过双射映射框架实现细粒度地图元素级修改，显著减少了合成先验带来的sim2real差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公开数据集缺乏地图先验、当前地图和传感器数据的三元组，导致方法必须依赖合成先验，造成不一致性和显著的sim2real差距。

Method: 采用双射映射框架，将大规模修改分解为地图元素级别的细粒度原子变化，确保可解释性。

Result: 实验表明，在ArgoTweak上训练的模型相比合成先验显著减少了sim2real差距，消融实验进一步验证了结构化先验和详细变化标注的重要性。

Conclusion: ArgoTweak为可解释的先验辅助高精地图建立了基准，推动了可扩展、自改进的地图解决方案发展。

Abstract: Reliable integration of prior information is crucial for self-verifying and
self-updating HD maps. However, no public dataset includes the required triplet
of prior maps, current maps, and sensor data. As a result, existing methods
must rely on synthetic priors, which create inconsistencies and lead to a
significant sim2real gap. To address this, we introduce ArgoTweak, the first
dataset to complete the triplet with realistic map priors. At its core,
ArgoTweak employs a bijective mapping framework, breaking down large-scale
modifications into fine-grained atomic changes at the map element level, thus
ensuring interpretability. This paradigm shift enables accurate change
detection and integration while preserving unchanged elements with high
fidelity. Experiments show that training models on ArgoTweak significantly
reduces the sim2real gap compared to synthetic priors. Extensive ablations
further highlight the impact of structured priors and detailed change
annotations. By establishing a benchmark for explainable, prior-aided HD
mapping, ArgoTweak advances scalable, self-improving mapping solutions. The
dataset, baselines, map modification toolbox, and further resources are
available at https://kth-rpl.github.io/ArgoTweak/.

Conclusion: 该框架证明了深度学习在基于移动图像的非侵入性、可访问和可解释的碳中毒病诊断中的潜力。可以作为农村和资源有限社区的实用诊断帮助工具，支持早期发现和及时干预。

Abstract: Background: Arsenicosis is a serious public health concern in South and
Southeast Asia, primarily caused by long-term consumption of
arsenic-contaminated water. Its early cutaneous manifestations are clinically
significant but often underdiagnosed, particularly in rural areas with limited
access to dermatologists. Automated, image-based diagnostic solutions can
support early detection and timely interventions.
  Methods: In this study, we propose an end-to-end framework for arsenicosis
diagnosis using mobile phone-captured skin images. A dataset comprising 20
classes and over 11000 images of arsenic-induced and other dermatological
conditions was curated. Multiple deep learning architectures, including
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models, were
benchmarked for arsenicosis detection. Model interpretability was integrated
via LIME and Grad-CAM, while deployment feasibility was demonstrated through a
web-based diagnostic tool.
  Results: Transformer-based models significantly outperformed CNNs, with the
Swin Transformer achieving the best results (86\\% accuracy). LIME and Grad-CAM
visualizations confirmed that the models attended to lesion-relevant regions,
increasing clinical transparency and aiding in error analysis. The framework
also demonstrated strong performance on external validation samples, confirming
its ability to generalize beyond the curated dataset.
  Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of deep
learning for non-invasive, accessible, and explainable diagnosis of arsenicosis
from mobile-acquired images. By enabling reliable image-based screening, it can
serve as a practical diagnostic aid in rural and resource-limited communities,
where access to dermatologists is scarce, thereby supporting early detection
and timely intervention.

Conclusion: 事件相机在低成本、低延迟星迹踪应用中具有实用性，结合其其他优势如更稀疏的数据流、更高动态范围、更低能耗和更快更新率

Abstract: Event-based cameras (EBCs) are a promising new technology for star
tracking-based attitude determination, but prior studies have struggled to
determine accurate ground truth for real data. We analyze the accuracy of an
EBC star tracking system utilizing the Earth's motion as the ground truth for
comparison. The Earth rotates in a regular way with very small irregularities
which are measured to the level of milli-arcseconds. By keeping an event camera
static and pointing it through a ground-based telescope at the night sky, we
create a system where the only camera motion in the celestial reference frame
is that induced by the Earth's rotation. The resulting event stream is
processed to generate estimates of orientation which we compare to the
International Earth Rotation and Reference System (IERS) measured orientation
of the Earth. The event camera system is able to achieve a root mean squared
across error of 18.47 arcseconds and an about error of 78.84 arcseconds.
Combined with the other benefits of event cameras over framing sensors (reduced
computation due to sparser data streams, higher dynamic range, lower energy
consumption, faster update rates), this level of accuracy suggests the utility
of event cameras for low-cost and low-latency star tracking. We provide all
code and data used to generate our results:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在每个尺度为每个源位置只产生单一对应假设，在深度不连续或目标图像是源图像的强缩放等挑战性情况下，相邻源位置的对应关系可能分布广泛，单一假设容易导致错误匹配。

Method: 采用beam search策略在每个尺度传播多个假设，并将这些多假设集成到交叉注意力层中，构建了名为BEAMER的新型密集匹配架构，学习跨尺度保留和传播多个假设。

Result: BEAMER相比最先进方法显著提高了鲁棒性，特别是在深度不连续和目标图像是源图像强缩放的情况下表现更好。

Conclusion: 通过预测和传播多个对应假设而非单一假设，BEAMER架构能够有效处理密集图像匹配中的挑战性情况，提升了匹配准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Dense image matching aims to find a correspondent for every pixel of a source
image in a partially overlapping target image. State-of-the-art methods
typically rely on a coarse-to-fine mechanism where a single correspondent
hypothesis is produced per source location at each scale. In challenging cases
-- such as at depth discontinuities or when the target image is a strong
zoom-in of the source image -- the correspondents of neighboring source
locations are often widely spread and predicting a single correspondent
hypothesis per source location at each scale may lead to erroneous matches. In
this paper, we investigate the idea of predicting multiple correspondent
hypotheses per source location at each scale instead. We consider a beam search
strategy to propagat multiple hypotheses at each scale and propose integrating
these multiple hypotheses into cross-attention layers, resulting in a novel
dense matching architecture called BEAMER. BEAMER learns to preserve and
propagate multiple hypotheses across scales, making it significantly more
robust than state-of-the-art methods, especially at depth discontinuities or
when the target image is a strong zoom-in of the source image.

Abstract: Recent advances in probabilistic generative models have extended capabilities
from static image synthesis to text-driven video generation. However, the
inherent randomness of their generation process can lead to unpredictable
artifacts, such as impossible physics and temporal inconsistency. Progress in
addressing these challenges requires systematic benchmarks, yet existing
datasets primarily focus on generative images due to the unique spatio-temporal
complexities of videos. To bridge this gap, we introduce GeneVA, a large-scale
artifact dataset with rich human annotations that focuses on spatio-temporal
artifacts in videos generated from natural text prompts. We hope GeneVA can
enable and assist critical applications, such as benchmarking model performance
and improving generative video quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉生成奖励模型存在架构限制：CLIP-based方法受模态约束，Bradley-Terry损失与VLM的下一个token预测机制不匹配，且RLHF优化过程中存在奖励黑客问题。

Method: 提出RewardDance框架，将奖励分数重新定义为模型预测"yes"token的概率，表示生成图像优于参考图像，使奖励目标与VLM架构内在对齐。支持模型规模扩展和上下文扩展（任务指令、参考示例、思维链推理）。

Result: RewardDance在文本到图像、文本到视频、图像到视频生成任务中显著超越最先进方法。大规模RM在RL微调期间保持高奖励方差，证明其抗黑客攻击能力并能产生多样化高质量输出。

Conclusion: RewardDance解决了视觉生成奖励模型的扩展瓶颈和奖励黑客问题，通过生成式奖励范式实现了模型规模和上下文两个维度的扩展，有效缓解了模式崩溃问题。

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are critical for improving generation models via
Reinforcement Learning (RL), yet the RM scaling paradigm in visual generation
remains largely unexplored. It primarily due to fundamental limitations in
existing approaches: CLIP-based RMs suffer from architectural and input
modality constraints, while prevalent Bradley-Terry losses are fundamentally
misaligned with the next-token prediction mechanism of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), hindering effective scaling. More critically, the RLHF optimization
process is plagued by Reward Hacking issue, where models exploit flaws in the
reward signal without improving true quality. To address these challenges, we
introduce RewardDance, a scalable reward modeling framework that overcomes
these barriers through a novel generative reward paradigm. By reformulating the
reward score as the model's probability of predicting a "yes" token, indicating
that the generated image outperforms a reference image according to specific
criteria, RewardDance intrinsically aligns reward objectives with VLM
architectures. This alignment unlocks scaling across two dimensions: (1) Model
Scaling: Systematic scaling of RMs up to 26 billion parameters; (2) Context
Scaling: Integration of task-specific instructions, reference examples, and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
RewardDance significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods in text-to-image,
text-to-video, and image-to-video generation. Crucially, we resolve the
persistent challenge of "reward hacking": Our large-scale RMs exhibit and
maintain high reward variance during RL fine-tuning, proving their resistance
to hacking and ability to produce diverse, high-quality outputs. It greatly
relieves the mode collapse problem that plagues smaller models.

Abstract: The reconstruction of three-dimensional dynamic scenes is a well-established
yet challenging task within the domain of computer vision. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach that combines the domains of 3D geometry
reconstruction and appearance estimation for physically based rendering and
present a system that is able to perform both tasks for fabrics, utilizing only
a single monocular RGB video sequence as input. In order to obtain realistic
and high-quality deformations and renderings, a physical simulation of the
cloth geometry and differentiable rendering are employed. In this paper, we
introduce two novel regularization terms for the 3D reconstruction task that
improve the plausibility of the reconstruction by addressing the depth
ambiguity problem in monocular video. In comparison with the most recent
methods in the field, we have reduced the error in the 3D reconstruction by a
factor of 2.64 while requiring a medium runtime of 30 min per scene.
Furthermore, the optimized motion achieves sufficient quality to perform an
appearance estimation of the deforming object, recovering sharp details from
this single monocular RGB video.
