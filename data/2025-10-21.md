### [1] [Quantum NLP models on Natural Language Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15972)
*Ling Sun,Peter Sullivan,Michael Martin,Yun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究量子自然语言处理在自然语言推理任务中的应用，比较了量子、混合和经典模型在少样本设置下的表现，提出了一种新的信息增益参数比指标来评估学习效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索量子自然语言处理在语义建模中的潜力，特别是在资源受限的少样本学习场景下，量子模型能否在保持性能的同时显著减少参数数量。

Method: 使用lambeq库和DisCoCat框架构建参数化量子电路处理句子对，训练语义相关性和推理分类任务，并提出基于聚类的架构来促进参数共享。

Result: 量子模型在性能上与经典基线相当，但参数数量大幅减少；在推理任务上优于随机初始化的transformer模型；量子模型的学习效率比经典模型高出最多五个数量级。

Conclusion: 量子自然语言处理在低资源、结构敏感的场景中具有巨大潜力，量子模型能够以更少的参数实现可比的性能，并展现出显著更高的学习效率。

Abstract: Quantum natural language processing (QNLP) offers a novel approach to
semantic modeling by embedding compositional structure directly into quantum
circuits. This paper investigates the application of QNLP models to the task of
Natural Language Inference (NLI), comparing quantum, hybrid, and classical
transformer-based models under a constrained few-shot setting. Using the lambeq
library and the DisCoCat framework, we construct parameterized quantum circuits
for sentence pairs and train them for both semantic relatedness and inference
classification. To assess efficiency, we introduce a novel
information-theoretic metric, Information Gain per Parameter (IGPP), which
quantifies learning dynamics independent of model size. Our results demonstrate
that quantum models achieve performance comparable to classical baselines while
operating with dramatically fewer parameters. The Quantum-based models
outperform randomly initialized transformers in inference and achieve lower
test error on relatedness tasks. Moreover, quantum models exhibit significantly
higher per-parameter learning efficiency (up to five orders of magnitude more
than classical counterparts), highlighting the promise of QNLP in low-resource,
structure-sensitive settings. To address circuit-level isolation and promote
parameter sharing, we also propose a novel cluster-based architecture that
improves generalization by tying gate parameters to learned word clusters
rather than individual tokens.

### [2] [Fusion-Augmented Large Language Models: Boosting Diagnostic Trustworthiness via Model Consensus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16057)
*Md Kamrul Siam,Md Jobair Hossain Faruk,Jerry Q. Cheng,Huanying Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出多模型融合框架，结合ChatGPT和Claude两种大语言模型，通过相似性共识方法提升胸部X光片诊断的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高AI辅助放射学诊断的可信度和临床实用性，减少诊断错误，同时最小化计算开销。

Method: 使用基于95%输出相似性阈值的共识方法，结合图像和合成临床笔记的多模态输入，在CheXpert数据集上评估模型性能。

Result: 单模态设置下，ChatGPT和Claude的准确率分别为62.8%和76.9%，共识方法提升至77.6%。多模态输入下，ChatGPT和Claude分别达到84%和76%，共识准确率达到91.3%。

Conclusion: 基于协议的融合方法持续优于单个模型，整合互补模态和使用输出级共识可显著提高AI辅助放射学诊断的可靠性和临床价值。

Abstract: This study presents a novel multi-model fusion framework leveraging two
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), ChatGPT and Claude, to enhance
the reliability of chest X-ray interpretation on the CheXpert dataset. From the
full CheXpert corpus of 224,316 chest radiographs, we randomly selected 234
radiologist-annotated studies to evaluate unimodal performance using image-only
prompts. In this setting, ChatGPT and Claude achieved diagnostic accuracies of
62.8% and 76.9%, respectively. A similarity-based consensus approach, using a
95% output similarity threshold, improved accuracy to 77.6%. To assess the
impact of multimodal inputs, we then generated synthetic clinical notes
following the MIMIC-CXR template and evaluated a separate subset of 50 randomly
selected cases paired with both images and synthetic text. On this multimodal
cohort, performance improved to 84% for ChatGPT and 76% for Claude, while
consensus accuracy reached 91.3%. Across both experimental conditions,
agreement-based fusion consistently outperformed individual models. These
findings highlight the utility of integrating complementary modalities and
using output-level consensus to improve the trustworthiness and clinical
utility of AI-assisted radiological diagnosis, offering a practical path to
reduce diagnostic errors with minimal computational overhead.

### [3] [Can LLMs Correct Themselves? A Benchmark of Self-Correction in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16062)
*Guiyao Tie,Zenghui Yuan,Zeli Zhao,Chaoran Hu,Tianhe Gu,Ruihang Zhang,Sizhe Zhang,Junran Wu,Xiaoyue Tu,Ming Jin,Qingsong Wen,Lixing Chen,Pan Zhou,Lichao Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了CorrectBench基准来评估大语言模型的自校正方法，发现在复杂推理任务中自校正能提升准确性，但会降低效率，而简单的思维链基线表现出竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有多种自校正方法被提出，但这些方法的全面评估仍然缺乏，且LLM是否真能自我校正仍是一个重要问题。

Method: 开发CorrectBench基准，评估内在、外部和微调三种自校正策略在常识推理、数学推理和代码生成三个任务上的效果。

Result: 1) 自校正方法能提高准确性，特别是复杂推理任务；2) 混合不同策略可进一步改进但降低效率；3) 推理LLM在额外自校正下优化有限且时间成本高；4) 简单思维链基线具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 自校正有潜力增强LLM推理性能，但需平衡推理能力与操作效率，建议进一步研究优化这一平衡。

Abstract: Self-correction of large language models (LLMs) emerges as a critical
component for enhancing their reasoning performance. Although various
self-correction methods have been proposed, a comprehensive evaluation of these
methods remains largely unexplored, and the question of whether LLMs can truly
correct themselves is a matter of significant interest and concern. In this
study, we introduce CorrectBench, a benchmark developed to evaluate the
effectiveness of self-correction strategies, including intrinsic, external, and
fine-tuned approaches, across three tasks: commonsense reasoning, mathematical
reasoning, and code generation. Our findings reveal that: 1) Self-correction
methods can improve accuracy, especially for complex reasoning tasks; 2) Mixing
different self-correction strategies yields further improvements, though it
reduces efficiency; 3) Reasoning LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) have limited
optimization under additional self-correction methods and have high time costs.
Interestingly, a comparatively simple chain-of-thought (CoT) baseline
demonstrates competitive accuracy and efficiency. These results underscore the
potential of self-correction to enhance LLM's reasoning performance while
highlighting the ongoing challenge of improving their efficiency. Consequently,
we advocate for further research focused on optimizing the balance between
reasoning capabilities and operational efficiency. Project Page:

### [4] [EvolveR: Self-Evolving LLM Agents through an Experience-Driven Lifecycle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16079)
*Rong Wu,Xiaoman Wang,Jianbiao Mei,Pinlong Cai,Daocheng Fu,Cheng Yang,Licheng Wen,Xuemeng Yang,Yufan Shen,Yuxin Wang,Botian Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EvolveR是一个让LLM智能体通过完整闭环经验生命周期实现自我改进的框架，包含离线自我蒸馏和在线交互两个关键阶段，在复杂多跳问答任务上表现优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM智能体在工具使用方面表现出色，但缺乏从自身经验中系统学习的能力。现有框架主要关注弥补外部知识差距，未能解决更根本的限制：无法迭代优化问题解决策略。

Method: EvolveR框架包含两个关键阶段：(1)离线自我蒸馏：将智能体交互轨迹合成为结构化、抽象可重用的策略原则库；(2)在线交互：智能体与任务交互并主动检索蒸馏原则指导决策，积累多样化行为轨迹。采用策略强化机制迭代更新智能体。

Result: 在复杂多跳问答基准测试中，EvolveR实现了优于强基线智能体的性能表现。

Conclusion: 该工作为智能体不仅从外部数据学习，还从自身行为后果学习的全面蓝图，为更自主和持续改进的系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Current Large Language Model (LLM) agents show strong performance in tool
use, but lack the crucial capability to systematically learn from their own
experiences. While existing frameworks mainly focus on mitigating external
knowledge gaps, they fail to address a more fundamental limitation: the
inability to iteratively refine problem-solving strategies. In this work, we
introduce EvolveR, a framework designed to enable agent to self-improve through
a complete, closed-loop experience lifecycle. This lifecycle comprises two key
stages: (1) Offline Self-Distillation, where the agent's interaction
trajectories are synthesized into a structured repository of abstract, reusable
strategic principles; (2) Online Interaction, where the agent interacts with
tasks and actively retrieves distilled principles to guide its decision-making,
accumulating a diverse set of behavioral trajectories. This loop employs a
policy reinforcement mechanism to iteratively update the agent based on its
performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EvolveR on complex multi-hop
question-answering benchmarks, where it achieves superior performance over
strong agentic baselines. Our work presents a comprehensive blueprint for
agents that learn not only from external data but also from the consequences of
their own actions, paving the way for more autonomous and continuously
improving systems. Code is available at https://github.com/Edaizi/EvolveR.

### [5] [Evaluating Prompting Strategies and Large Language Models in Systematic Literature Review Screening: Relevance and Task-Stage Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16091)
*Binglan Han,Anuradha Mathrani,Teo Susnjak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究量化了提示策略与大型语言模型在系统文献综述筛选阶段的交互作用，通过评估6个LLM模型在5种提示类型下的表现，发现CoT-few-shot提供最可靠的精度-召回平衡，并推荐分阶段工作流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统分析提示策略与大型语言模型在文献筛选自动化中的交互作用，为任务自适应LLM部署提供比较基准和实践指导。

Method: 评估6个LLM模型（GPT-4o、GPT-4o-mini、DeepSeek-Chat-V3、Gemini-2.5-Flash、Claude-3.5-Haiku、Llama-4-Maverick）在5种提示类型（零样本、少样本、思维链、CoT-少样本、自我反思）下的表现，使用准确率、精度、召回率和F1指标。

Result: 发现明显的模型-提示交互效应：CoT-少样本提供最可靠的精度-召回平衡；零样本在高灵敏度筛选中最大化召回率；自我反思因过度包容性和模型间不稳定性表现不佳。GPT-4o和DeepSeek整体表现稳健，GPT-4o-mini在显著更低成本下表现具竞争力。

Conclusion: 推荐分阶段工作流程：首先使用低成本模型和结构化提示进行初步筛选，仅将边界案例升级到高容量模型。研究结果突显了LLM在文献筛选自动化中不均衡但有前景的潜力。

Abstract: This study quantifies how prompting strategies interact with large language
models (LLMs) to automate the screening stage of systematic literature reviews
(SLRs). We evaluate six LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-Chat-V3,
Gemini-2.5-Flash, Claude-3.5-Haiku, Llama-4-Maverick) under five prompt types
(zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), CoT-few-shot, self-reflection)
across relevance classification and six Level-2 tasks, using accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1. Results show pronounced model-prompt interaction
effects: CoT-few-shot yields the most reliable precision-recall balance;
zero-shot maximizes recall for high-sensitivity passes; and self-reflection
underperforms due to over-inclusivity and instability across models. GPT-4o and
DeepSeek provide robust overall performance, while GPT-4o-mini performs
competitively at a substantially lower dollar cost. A cost-performance analysis
for relevance classification (per 1,000 abstracts) reveals large absolute
differences among model-prompt pairings; GPT-4o-mini remains low-cost across
prompts, and structured prompts (CoT/CoT-few-shot) on GPT-4o-mini offer
attractive F1 at a small incremental cost. We recommend a staged workflow that
(1) deploys low-cost models with structured prompts for first-pass screening
and (2) escalates only borderline cases to higher-capacity models. These
findings highlight LLMs' uneven but promising potential to automate literature
screening. By systematically analyzing prompt-model interactions, we provide a
comparative benchmark and practical guidance for task-adaptive LLM deployment.

### [6] [Facts in Stats: Impacts of Pretraining Diversity on Language Model Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16096)
*Tina Behnia,Puneesh Deora,Christos Thrampoulidis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个合成测试平台，用于系统分析语言模型中统计规律与事实关联之间的交互对泛化能力的影响。研究发现上下文多样性和结构对事实泛化有复杂影响，并识别了不同的优化瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对语言模型中统计规律与事实关联交互影响的系统分析，特别是这种交互如何影响泛化能力。

Method: 设计了一个灵活的合成测试平台，将通用标记的统计流与源-目标标记对的事实流结合，能够精细控制它们的交互，包括上下文结构和多样性水平。

Result: 研究发现更高的上下文多样性会延迟分布内事实准确性，但对分布外事实泛化的影响取决于上下文结构。在某些情况下，分布外性能与分布内趋势一致，而在其他情况下，多样性对非平凡事实回忆至关重要。

Conclusion: 上下文设计和多样性水平的相互作用以不同方式影响泛化能力，通过模型组件干预发现分布外失败源于不同的优化瓶颈，特别是嵌入和解嵌入层的重要性。

Abstract: Language models are pretrained on sequences that blend statistical
regularities (making text fluent) with factual associations between specific
tokens (knowledge of facts). While recent work suggests that the variability of
their interaction, such as paraphrases of factual associations, critically
determines generalization ability, we lack a systematic analysis of these
impacts. This paper introduces a flexible synthetic testbed that combines a
statistical stream of generic tokens with an abstract factual stream of
source-target token pairs, enabling fine-grained control over their
interaction. The design enables the independent control of diversity nature by
manipulating stream composition (contextual structure) and the diversity level
by varying which statistical streams each fact appears in. Through controlled
experiments, we find that while higher contextual diversity delays
in-distribution (ID) factual accuracy, its impact on out-of-distribution (OOD)
factual generalization depends critically on contextual structure. In some
cases, OOD performance follows the same trend as ID, but in others, diversity
becomes essential for non-trivial factual recall. Even when low diversity
prohibits factual recall, optimal diversity levels depend on training duration.
Beyond factual recall failures, we identify structures where statistical
generalization fails independently, and others where both capabilities degrade.
This shows how the interplay between contextual design and diversity level
impacts different generalization aspects. Further, through a series of
controlled interventions on the model components, we trace the OOD failures to
distinct optimization bottlenecks, highlighting the importance of the embedding
and unembedding layers. Our synthetic framework allows us to isolate effects
that would be confounded in large-scale studies, offering a controlled testbed
for future investigations.

### [7] [In Generative AI We (Dis)Trust? Computational Analysis of Trust and Distrust in Reddit Discussions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16173)
*Aria Pessianzadeh,Naima Sultana,Hildegarde Van den Bulck,David Gefen,Shahin Jabari,Rezvaneh Rezapour*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 首个关于生成式AI信任与不信任的计算研究，使用2022-2025年Reddit数据，发现信任与不信任基本平衡，技术性能和可用性是主要维度，个人经验是态度形成的最常见原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI日益普及，但缺乏大规模、纵向的信任测量方法，需要理解公众信任以促进负责任采用和治理。

Method: 使用多年度Reddit数据集（39个子版块，197,618个帖子），结合众包标注和分类模型进行扩展分析。

Result: 信任与不信任随时间基本平衡，主要模型发布时出现波动；技术性能和可用性是最重要的维度；个人经验是态度形成的最常见原因；不同用户群体（专家、伦理学家、普通用户）呈现不同模式。

Conclusion: 提供了大规模信任分析的方法框架，揭示了公众对生成式AI不断演变的认知，为负责任AI采用和治理提供见解。

Abstract: The rise of generative AI (GenAI) has impacted many aspects of human life. As
these systems become embedded in everyday practices, understanding public trust
in them also becomes essential for responsible adoption and governance. Prior
work on trust in AI has largely drawn from psychology and human-computer
interaction, but there is a lack of computational, large-scale, and
longitudinal approaches to measuring trust and distrust in GenAI and large
language models (LLMs). This paper presents the first computational study of
Trust and Distrust in GenAI, using a multi-year Reddit dataset (2022--2025)
spanning 39 subreddits and 197,618 posts. Crowd-sourced annotations of a
representative sample were combined with classification models to scale
analysis. We find that Trust and Distrust are nearly balanced over time, with
shifts around major model releases. Technical performance and usability
dominate as dimensions, while personal experience is the most frequent reason
shaping attitudes. Distinct patterns also emerge across trustors (e.g.,
experts, ethicists, general users). Our results provide a methodological
framework for large-scale Trust analysis and insights into evolving public
perceptions of GenAI.

### [8] [EgMM-Corpus: A Multimodal Vision-Language Dataset for Egyptian Culture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16198)
*Mohamed Gamil,Abdelrahman Elsayed,Abdelrahman Lila,Ahmed Gad,Hesham Abdelgawad,Mohamed Aref,Ahmed Fares*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 介绍了EgMM-Corpus，一个专门针对埃及文化的多模态数据集，包含3000多张图像，涵盖313个概念，用于评估和训练视觉语言模型在埃及文化背景下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中东和非洲地区的多模态文化多样性数据集仍然有限，需要专门的文化数据集来减少大规模视觉语言模型中的文化偏见。

Method: 设计和运行新的数据收集流程，收集了涵盖地标、食物和民间传说等313个概念的3000多张图像，每个条目都经过文化真实性和多模态一致性的手动验证。

Result: CLIP模型在EgMM-Corpus上的零样本分类性能：Top-1准确率为21.2%，Top-5准确率为36.4%。

Conclusion: 结果凸显了大规模视觉语言模型中存在的文化偏见，证明了EgMM-Corpus作为开发文化感知模型基准的重要性。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in AI, multimodal culturally diverse datasets are
still limited, particularly for regions in the Middle East and Africa. In this
paper, we introduce EgMM-Corpus, a multimodal dataset dedicated to Egyptian
culture. By designing and running a new data collection pipeline, we collected
over 3,000 images, covering 313 concepts across landmarks, food, and folklore.
Each entry in the dataset is manually validated for cultural authenticity and
multimodal coherence. EgMM-Corpus aims to provide a reliable resource for
evaluating and training vision-language models in an Egyptian cultural context.
We further evaluate the zero-shot performance of Contrastive Language-Image
Pre-training CLIP on EgMM-Corpus, on which it achieves 21.2% Top-1 accuracy and
36.4% Top-5 accuracy in classification. These results underscore the existing
cultural bias in large-scale vision-language models and demonstrate the
importance of EgMM-Corpus as a benchmark for developing culturally aware
models.

### [9] [What Can String Probability Tell Us About Grammaticality?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16227)
*Jennifer Hu,Ethan Gotlieb Wilcox,Siyuan Song,Kyle Mahowald,Roger P. Levy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文分析了语言模型对语法的学习情况，通过理论框架验证了字符串概率与语法知识之间的关系，使用28万句对在英语和中文中进行实证验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型是否真正学习了语法知识，以及字符串概率能否反映模型的语法能力，这对语言学理论有重要影响。

Method: 基于语料库数据生成过程的简单假设，建立理论分析框架，并通过280K英语和中文句子对进行实证验证，包括最小对字符串概率相关性分析。

Result: 验证了三个预测：(1)最小对字符串概率相关性；(2)模型与人类在最小对中差异的相关性；(3)语法和非语法字符串在概率空间中分离度差。

Conclusion: 为使用概率来了解语言模型的结构知识提供了理论基础，并为未来语言模型语法评估工作指明了方向。

Abstract: What have language models (LMs) learned about grammar? This question remains
hotly debated, with major ramifications for linguistic theory. However, since
probability and grammaticality are distinct notions in linguistics, it is not
obvious what string probabilities can reveal about an LM's underlying
grammatical knowledge. We present a theoretical analysis of the relationship
between grammar, meaning, and string probability, based on simple assumptions
about the generative process of corpus data. Our framework makes three
predictions, which we validate empirically using 280K sentence pairs in English
and Chinese: (1) correlation between the probability of strings within minimal
pairs, i.e., string pairs with minimal semantic differences; (2) correlation
between models' and humans' deltas within minimal pairs; and (3) poor
separation in probability space between unpaired grammatical and ungrammatical
strings. Our analyses give theoretical grounding for using probability to learn
about LMs' structural knowledge, and suggest directions for future work in LM
grammatical evaluation.

### [10] [Towards Low-Resource Alignment to Diverse Perspectives with Sparse Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16257)
*Chu Fei Luo,Samuel Dahan,Xiaodan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了两种低资源设置下的方法（多元化解码和模型引导）来增强语言模型的多元对齐能力，仅用50个标注样本就能在多个高风险任务中取得显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型对社会影响日益增大，需要确保它们能够对齐多样化的观点并反映人类价值观的细微差别。当前主流训练范式假设每个查询只有一个最优答案，导致响应泛化且对齐效果差。

Method: 提出两种方法：1) 多元化解码 - 生成多样化的响应；2) 模型引导 - 在低资源设置下（仅50个标注样本）引导模型学习多元观点。

Result: 模型引导方法在零样本和少样本基线上表现一致改进，在仇恨言论检测和错误信息检测等高风险任务中降低了假阳性率，在GlobalOpinionQA上提高了与人类价值观的分布对齐度。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了多样性的重要性，展示了语言模型如何适应考虑细微观点的可能性，为构建更具包容性和代表性的AI系统提供了可行路径。

Abstract: As language models have a greater impact on society, it is important to
ensure they are aligned to a diverse range of perspectives and are able to
reflect nuance in human values. However, the most popular training paradigms
for modern language models often assume there is one optimal answer for every
query, leading to generic responses and poor alignment. In this work, we aim to
enhance pluralistic alignment of language models in a low-resource setting with
two methods: pluralistic decoding and model steering. We empirically
demonstrate that model steering offers consistent improvement over zero-shot
and few-shot baselines with only 50 annotated samples. Our proposed methods
decrease false positives in several high-stakes tasks such as hate speech
detection and misinformation detection, and improves the distributional
alignment to human values in GlobalOpinionQA. We hope our work highlights the
importance of diversity and how language models can be adapted to consider
nuanced perspectives.

*Zhaoxuan Tan,Zixuan Zhang,Haoyang Wen,Zheng Li,Rongzhi Zhang,Pei Chen,Fengran Mo,Zheyuan Liu,Qingkai Zeng,Qingyu Yin,Meng Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Profile-to-PEFT框架，使用超网络将用户配置文件映射到适配器参数，无需为每个用户单独训练，实现高效实时的LLM个性化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法需要为每个用户训练单独的适配器，计算成本高且无法实时更新，限制了大规模个性化应用。

Method: 使用端到端训练的超网络，将编码后的用户配置文件直接映射到完整的适配器参数（如LoRA），部署时无需对每个用户进行训练。

Result: 该方法在性能上优于基于提示的个性化和One-PEFT-Per-User方法，同时部署时计算资源消耗显著减少，对分布外用户具有良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Profile-to-PEFT框架实现了高效、可扩展和自适应的LLM个性化，适用于大规模应用场景。

Abstract: Personalized large language models (LLMs) tailor content to individual
preferences using user profiles or histories. However, existing
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as the
``One-PEFT-Per-User'' (OPPU) paradigm, require training a separate adapter for
each user, making them computationally expensive and impractical for real-time
updates. We introduce Profile-to-PEFT, a scalable framework that employs a
hypernetwork, trained end-to-end, to map a user's encoded profile directly to a
full set of adapter parameters (e.g., LoRA), eliminating per-user training at
deployment. This design enables instant adaptation, generalization to unseen
users, and privacy-preserving local deployment. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms both prompt-based personalization and
OPPU while using substantially fewer computational resources at deployment. The
framework exhibits strong generalization to out-of-distribution users and
maintains robustness across varying user activity levels and different
embedding backbones. The proposed Profile-to-PEFT framework enables efficient,
scalable, and adaptive LLM personalization suitable for large-scale
applications.

*Pratham Singla,Shivank Garg,Ayush Singh,Ishan Garg,Ketan Suhaas Saichandran*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了后训练LLM对自身学习内容的认知能力，发现RL训练模型比SFT模型更了解所学行为且泛化能力更强，但推理轨迹与最终输出的一致性较弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLM是否意识到自己"学习"和"思考"的内容，定义三个核心能力：对学习策略的认知、策略跨领域泛化、推理与输出的对齐。

Method: 在多个需要学习不同策略的任务上实证评估，对比SFT、DPO和GRPO三种后训练方法的模型表现。

Result: RL训练模型比SFT模型更了解所学行为，在结构相似的新任务上泛化能力更强，但推理轨迹与最终输出的一致性较弱，GRPO模型尤其明显。

Conclusion: 后训练方法显著影响LLM的元认知能力，RL方法增强策略认知和泛化，但可能损害推理透明度。

Abstract: Recent advances in post-training techniques have endowed Large Language
Models (LLMs) with enhanced capabilities for tackling complex, logic-intensive
tasks through the generation of supplementary planning tokens. This development
raises a fundamental question: Are these models aware of what they "learn" and
"think"? To address this, we define three core competencies: (1) awareness of
learned latent policies, (2) generalization of these policies across domains,
and (3) alignment between internal reasoning traces and final outputs. We
empirically evaluate these abilities on several tasks, each designed to require
learning a distinct policy. Furthermore, we contrast the profiles of models
post-trained via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Policy Optimization
(DPO), and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our findings indicate
that RL-trained models not only demonstrate greater awareness of their learned
behaviors and stronger generalizability to novel, structurally similar tasks
than SFT models but also often exhibit weak alignment between their reasoning
traces and final outputs, an effect most pronounced in GRPO-trained models.

### [13] [Utilising Large Language Models for Generating Effective Counter Arguments to Anti-Vaccine Tweets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16359)
*Utsav Dhanuka,Soham Poddar,Saptarshi Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探索使用大语言模型生成针对疫苗错误信息的反驳论点，通过多种提示策略和微调方法优化反驳生成，并训练分类器对反疫苗推文进行多标签分类以实现更情境感知的反驳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在社交媒体影响公共卫生的时代，打击疫苗怀疑论和错误信息成为关键社会目标。虽然错误信息检测取得进展，但实时生成针对性反驳论点仍是一个未充分探索的领域。

Method: 实验多种提示策略和微调方法优化反驳论点生成，训练分类器将反疫苗推文分类为疫苗效力、副作用、政治影响等多标签类别，实现情境感知的反驳。

Result: 通过人工判断、LLM评估和自动指标的评估显示这些方法之间具有强一致性，整合标签描述和结构化微调能增强反驳论点的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模缓解疫苗错误信息提供了一个有前景的途径。

Abstract: In an era where public health is increasingly influenced by information
shared on social media, combatting vaccine skepticism and misinformation has
become a critical societal goal. Misleading narratives around vaccination have
spread widely, creating barriers to achieving high immunisation rates and
undermining trust in health recommendations. While efforts to detect
misinformation have made significant progress, the generation of real time
counter-arguments tailored to debunk such claims remains an insufficiently
explored area. In this work, we explore the capabilities of LLMs to generate
sound counter-argument rebuttals to vaccine misinformation. Building on prior
research in misinformation debunking, we experiment with various prompting
strategies and fine-tuning approaches to optimise counter-argument generation.
Additionally, we train classifiers to categorise anti-vaccine tweets into
multi-labeled categories such as concerns about vaccine efficacy, side effects,
and political influences allowing for more context aware rebuttals. Our
evaluation, conducted through human judgment, LLM based assessments, and
automatic metrics, reveals strong alignment across these methods. Our findings
demonstrate that integrating label descriptions and structured fine-tuning
enhances counter-argument effectiveness, offering a promising approach for
mitigating vaccine misinformation at scale.

TL;DR: 本文提出了AASP框架，使用自回归结构预测方法联合建模论证挖掘中的论证组件和论证关系，在三个标准基准测试中取得了SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 论证挖掘任务中建模论证组件和论证关系之间的依赖关系具有挑战性，现有方法通过生成范式扁平化处理论证结构，本文旨在以端到端方式联合建模这些关键任务。

Method: 提出自回归论证结构预测(AASP)框架，将论证结构建模为预定义约束动作集，使用条件预训练语言模型以自回归方式逐步构建论证结构，有效捕捉论证推理流程。

Result: 在三个标准论证挖掘基准测试中，AASP在两个基准上所有任务都取得了最先进结果，在另一个基准上也表现强劲。

Conclusion: AASP框架通过自回归结构预测有效解决了论证挖掘中的复杂依赖建模问题，在多个基准测试中验证了其优越性能。

Abstract: Argument Mining (AM) helps in automating the extraction of complex
argumentative structures such as Argument Components (ACs) like Premise, Claim
etc. and Argumentative Relations (ARs) like Support, Attack etc. in an
argumentative text. Due to the inherent complexity of reasoning involved with
this task, modelling dependencies between ACs and ARs is challenging. Most of
the recent approaches formulate this task through a generative paradigm by
flattening the argumentative structures. In contrast to that, this study
jointly formulates the key tasks of AM in an end-to-end fashion using
Autoregressive Argumentative Structure Prediction (AASP) framework. The
proposed AASP framework is based on the autoregressive structure prediction
framework that has given good performance for several NLP tasks. AASP framework
models the argumentative structures as constrained pre-defined sets of actions
with the help of a conditional pre-trained language model. These actions build
the argumentative structures step-by-step in an autoregressive manner to
capture the flow of argumentative reasoning in an efficient way. Extensive
experiments conducted on three standard AM benchmarks demonstrate that AASP
achieves state-of-theart (SoTA) results across all AM tasks in two benchmarks
and delivers strong results in one benchmark.

*Federico Ravenda,Seyed Ali Bahrainian,Andrea Raballo,Antonietta Mira*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级方法，通过线性变换特定层的激活向量来提升LLM在心理健康评估任务中的表现，无需计算密集型技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在快速发展，但小规模模型在特定领域应用中仍表现不佳，特别是在心理健康这样的敏感高影响领域。

Method: 采用轻量级方法，对特定层的激活应用线性变换，利用转向向量引导模型输出。

Result: 该方法在两个不同任务中均取得改进：识别Reddit帖子是否有助于检测抑郁症状的相关性预测任务，以及基于用户Reddit历史完成标准化抑郁筛查问卷的任务。

Conclusion: 转向机制作为计算效率高的工具，在LLMs心理健康领域适应方面具有未开发的潜力。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) is transforming AI,
opening new opportunities in sensitive and high-impact areas such as Mental
Health (MH). Yet, despite these advancements, recent evidence reveals that
smaller-scale models still struggle to deliver optimal performance in
domain-specific applications. In this study, we present a cost-efficient yet
powerful approach to improve MH assessment capabilities of an LLM, without
relying on any computationally intensive techniques. Our lightweight method
consists of a linear transformation applied to a specific layer's activations,
leveraging steering vectors to guide the model's output. Remarkably, this
intervention enables the model to achieve improved results across two distinct
tasks: (1) identifying whether a Reddit post is useful for detecting the
presence or absence of depressive symptoms (relevance prediction task), and (2)
completing a standardized psychological screening questionnaire for depression
based on users' Reddit post history (questionnaire completion task). Results
highlight the untapped potential of steering mechanisms as computationally
efficient tools for LLMs' MH domain adaptation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MoReBench是一个包含1000个道德场景和23000多个评估标准的基准测试，用于评估AI在道德推理过程中的表现，填补了现有数学、代码和科学推理基准在道德推理评估上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统在决策中扮演越来越重要的角色，需要理解AI的决策过程而不仅仅是最终结果。道德困境是评估过程推理的理想测试平台，因为允许多种合理的结论。

Method: 创建MoReBench基准，包含道德场景和专家制定的评估标准，涵盖识别道德考量、权衡利弊、给出可行建议等方面。同时创建MoReBench-Theory测试AI在五种主要规范伦理学框架下的推理能力。

Result: 研究发现扩展定律和现有基准无法预测模型在道德推理上的能力。模型对特定道德框架（如边沁功利主义和康德义务论）表现出偏好，这可能是流行训练范式的副作用。

Conclusion: 这些基准推动了以过程为重点的推理评估，有助于开发更安全、更透明的AI系统。

Abstract: As AI systems progress, we rely more on them to make decisions with us and
for us. To ensure that such decisions are aligned with human values, it is
imperative for us to understand not only what decisions they make but also how
they come to those decisions. Reasoning language models, which provide both
final responses and (partially transparent) intermediate thinking traces,
present a timely opportunity to study AI procedural reasoning. Unlike math and
code problems which often have objectively correct answers, moral dilemmas are
an excellent testbed for process-focused evaluation because they allow for
multiple defensible conclusions. To do so, we present MoReBench: 1,000 moral
scenarios, each paired with a set of rubric criteria that experts consider
essential to include (or avoid) when reasoning about the scenarios. MoReBench
contains over 23 thousand criteria including identifying moral considerations,
weighing trade-offs, and giving actionable recommendations to cover cases on AI
advising humans moral decisions as well as making moral decisions autonomously.
Separately, we curate MoReBench-Theory: 150 examples to test whether AI can
reason under five major frameworks in normative ethics. Our results show that
scaling laws and existing benchmarks on math, code, and scientific reasoning
tasks fail to predict models' abilities to perform moral reasoning. Models also
show partiality towards specific moral frameworks (e.g., Benthamite Act
Utilitarianism and Kantian Deontology), which might be side effects of popular
training paradigms. Together, these benchmarks advance process-focused
reasoning evaluation towards safer and more transparent AI.

*David Peer,Sebastian Stabinger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出ATA方法，通过神经符号分离将任务分解为离线知识提取和在线任务处理，提升LLM的可信度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在关键领域部署时的幻觉、不稳定性和缺乏透明度等可信度问题

Method: 将任务分为两个阶段：离线阶段LLM将问题规范转化为形式化知识库，在线阶段符号决策引擎基于形式化知识进行推理

Result: 在复杂推理任务中，ATA与最先进的端到端推理模型性能相当，且具有完美确定性、增强的稳定性和抗提示注入攻击能力

Conclusion: ATA为构建透明、可审计、可靠的下一代自主代理提供了实用可控的架构

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities, yet
their deployment in high-stakes domains is hindered by inherent limitations in
trustworthiness, including hallucinations, instability, and a lack of
transparency. To address these challenges, we introduce a generic
neuro-symbolic approach, which we call Autonomous Trustworthy Agents (ATA). The
core of our approach lies in decoupling tasks into two distinct phases: Offline
knowledge ingestion and online task processing. During knowledge ingestion, an
LLM translates an informal problem specification into a formal, symbolic
knowledge base. This formal representation is crucial as it can be verified and
refined by human experts, ensuring its correctness and alignment with domain
requirements. In the subsequent task processing phase, each incoming input is
encoded into the same formal language. A symbolic decision engine then utilizes
this encoded input in conjunction with the formal knowledge base to derive a
reliable result. Through an extensive evaluation on a complex reasoning task,
we demonstrate that a concrete implementation of ATA is competitive with
state-of-the-art end-to-end reasoning models in a fully automated setup while
maintaining trustworthiness. Crucially, with a human-verified and corrected
knowledge base, our approach significantly outperforms even larger models,
while exhibiting perfect determinism, enhanced stability against input
perturbations, and inherent immunity to prompt injection attacks. By generating
decisions grounded in symbolic reasoning, ATA offers a practical and
controllable architecture for building the next generation of transparent,
auditable, and reliable autonomous agents.

TL;DR: 本研究探索了Whisper语音识别模型在第二语言口语评估中的潜力，通过提取其隐藏表示中的声学和语言特征，仅需训练轻量级分类器即可在GEPT数据集上超越现有先进基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要分析Whisper产生的转录文本，本研究旨在深入挖掘其潜在能力，探索其在第二语言口语评估中的应用价值。

Method: 从Whisper的中间和最终输出中提取声学和语言特征，仅训练轻量级分类器，并引入图像和文本提示作为辅助相关线索。

Result: 在GEPT图片描述数据集上表现出色，超越了包括多模态方法在内的现有先进基线，通过添加辅助信息获得额外性能提升。

Conclusion: 即使没有任务特定的微调，Whisper模型本质上编码了口语熟练度的序数模式和语义方面，显示出其作为口语评估和口语理解任务的强大基础模型的潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the untapped potential of Whisper, a
well-established automatic speech recognition (ASR) foundation model, in the
context of L2 spoken language assessment (SLA). Unlike prior studies that
extrinsically analyze transcriptions produced by Whisper, our approach goes a
step further to probe its latent capabilities by extracting acoustic and
linguistic features from hidden representations. With only a lightweight
classifier being trained on top of Whisper's intermediate and final outputs,
our method achieves strong performance on the GEPT picture-description dataset,
outperforming existing cutting-edge baselines, including a multimodal approach.
Furthermore, by incorporating image and text-prompt information as auxiliary
relevance cues, we demonstrate additional performance gains. Finally, we
conduct an in-depth analysis of Whisper's embeddings, which reveals that, even
without task-specific fine-tuning, the model intrinsically encodes both ordinal
proficiency patterns and semantic aspects of speech, highlighting its potential
as a powerful foundation for SLA and other spoken language understanding tasks.

### [19] [FrugalPrompt: Reducing Contextual Overhead in Large Language Models via Token Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16439)
*Syed Rifat Raiyan,Md Farhan Ishmam,Abdullah Al Imran,Mohammad Ali Moni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FrugalPrompt是一个新颖的LLM提示压缩框架，通过保留最具语义重要性的token来减少输入长度，在多个NLP任务中实现20%压缩率时仅带来轻微性能损失，但在数学推理任务中性能急剧下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM中冗长输入带来的成本、碳足迹和推理延迟问题，因为典型提示中存在大量冗余的低效用token，只有少数token承载主要语义权重。

Method: 使用GlobEnc和DecompX两种token归因方法为输入序列中的每个token分配显著性分数，按原始顺序保留前k%的token，获得稀疏的压缩提示。

Result: 在前三个任务（情感分析、常识问答、摘要）中，20%的提示压缩仅带来边际性能损失；但在数学推理中性能急剧恶化；使用底部k%和随机k%token的分析揭示了不对称性能模式。

Conclusion: 该工作有助于更细致地理解LLM在性能-效率权衡中的行为，并界定了容忍上下文稀疏性的任务与需要完整上下文的任务之间的边界。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) owe much of their stellar performance to
expansive input contexts, yet such verbosity inflates monetary costs, carbon
footprint, and inference-time latency. Much of this overhead manifests from the
redundant low-utility tokens present in typical prompts, as only a fraction of
tokens typically carries the majority of the semantic weight. We address this
inefficiency by introducing FrugalPrompt, a novel prompt compression framework
for LLMs, which retains only the most semantically significant tokens.
Leveraging two state-of-the-art token attribution methods, GlobEnc and DecompX,
we assign salience scores to every token in an input sequence, rank them to
preserve the top-k% tokens in their original order, and obtain a sparse
frugalized prompt. We evaluate the approach across four NLP tasks: Sentiment
Analysis, Commonsense QA, Summarization, and Mathematical Reasoning, using a
suite of frontier LLMs. For the first three tasks, a 20% prompt reduction
incurs only a marginal loss in task performance, demonstrating that
contemporary LLMs can reconstruct elided context from high-salience cues. In
contrast, performance on mathematical reasoning deteriorates sharply,
reflecting a stronger dependence on complete token continuity. Further analysis
with bottom-k% and random-k% tokens reveals asymmetric performance patterns
that may suggest potential task contamination effects, wherein models may
resort to shallow memorized patterns from pretraining exposure for conventional
NLP tasks. We posit that our work contributes to a more nuanced understanding
of LLM behavior in performance-efficiency trade-offs, and delineate the
boundary between tasks tolerant to contextual sparsity and those requiring
exhaustive context. Our source code and models are available at:

TL;DR: TrajSelector是一个高效的Best-of-N框架，利用LLM的隐藏状态进行过程级评分，通过轻量级验证器评估推理轨迹质量，在保持较低推理成本的同时显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有外部TTS方法面临计算开销高和未充分利用LLM内在潜在表示的问题，需要更高效的轨迹选择框架。

Method: 使用轻量级验证器（仅0.6B参数）评估步骤级轨迹质量，通过端到端训练利用LLM隐藏状态进行过程评分，无需大量步骤级标注。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，TrajSelector在Best-of-32设置下比多数投票准确率高4.61%，比现有过程奖励模型高4.31%-12.21%，且推理成本更低。

Conclusion: TrajSelector通过有效利用LLM内在表示，提供了一种计算效率高且性能优越的推理轨迹选择方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in complex
reasoning tasks, largely enabled by test-time scaling (TTS) paradigms that
allocate additional compute during inference. Among these, external TTS
(particularly the Best-of-N selection paradigm) yields scalable performance
improvements by selecting from multiple independently generated reasoning
trajectories. However, this approach faces key limitations: (i) the high
computational overhead of deploying process reward models, (ii) the
underutilization of the LLM's intrinsic latent representations. We introduce
TrajSelector, an efficient and effective Best-of-N framework that exploit the
hidden states in the sampler LLM for process-level scoring. A lightweight
verifier (with only 0.6B parameters) evaluates the quality of step-wise
trajectory, and then aggregates these scores to identify the optimal reasoning
trajectory. Our framework employs a fully data-driven, end-to-end training
recipe that eliminates reliance on massive step-level annotations. Experiential
results across five benchmarks demonstrate that TrajSelector delivers
consistent performance gains. In Best-of-32 settings, it surpasses majority
voting by 4.61% accuracy and outperforms existing process reward models by
4.31% to 12.21%, all while maintaining lower inference costs.

Motivation: 现有广告视频违规检测方法在精确时间定位、噪声标注和泛化能力方面存在不足，需要开发更有效的检测框架。

Method: 结合课程强化学习和多模态大语言模型，采用渐进式训练策略整合精确和粗略标注数据，使用GRPO算法开发推理能力，并通过分层奖励机制确保时间定位和类别预测的一致性。

Result: 在工业数据集和公共基准测试中表现出色，在线A/B测试验证了其实际应用价值，在精确率和召回率方面有显著提升，并展现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: RAVEN框架有效解决了广告视频违规检测中的关键挑战，为在线广告服务提供了实用的解决方案，并缓解了监督微调中的灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Advertisement (Ad) video violation detection is critical for ensuring
platform compliance, but existing methods struggle with precise temporal
grounding, noisy annotations, and limited generalization. We propose RAVEN, a
novel framework that integrates curriculum reinforcement learning with
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enhance reasoning and cognitive
capabilities for violation detection. RAVEN employs a progressive training
strategy, combining precisely and coarsely annotated data, and leverages Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to develop emergent reasoning abilities
without explicit reasoning annotations. Multiple hierarchical sophisticated
reward mechanism ensures precise temporal grounding and consistent category
prediction. Experiments on industrial datasets and public benchmarks show that
RAVEN achieves superior performances in violation category accuracy and
temporal interval localization. We also design a pipeline to deploy the RAVEN
on the online Ad services, and online A/B testing further validates its
practical applicability, with significant improvements in precision and recall.
RAVEN also demonstrates strong generalization, mitigating the catastrophic
forgetting issue associated with supervised fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 该论文通过解释分析扩展了自然语言推理中标注变异的理解，不仅关注标注一致但解释不同的情况，还研究了标注和解释都不同的情况，发现表面标注分歧可能掩盖深层的解释一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注标注一致但解释不同的情况，而本文旨在更全面地理解NLI数据集中的人类标注变异，通过解释分析来揭示标注者推理过程的差异。

Method: 使用LiTEx分类法分析两个英文NLI数据集，从多个维度对齐标注变异：NLI标签一致性、解释相似性和分类法一致性，并考虑标注者的选择偏见。

Result: 发现标注者可能在标签上存在分歧但提供高度相似的解释，表明表面分歧可能掩盖解释层面的一致性；同时揭示了标注者在解释策略和标签选择上的个体偏好。

Conclusion: 推理类型的一致性比单纯的标签一致性更能反映自由文本解释的语义相似性，强调了基于推理的解释的丰富性，以及将标签视为绝对真实时需要谨慎对待。

Abstract: Natural Language Inference datasets often exhibit human label variation. To
better understand these variations, explanation-based approaches analyze the
underlying reasoning behind annotators' decisions. One such approach is the
LiTEx taxonomy, which categorizes free-text explanations in English into
reasoning types. However, previous work applying such taxonomies has focused on
within-label variation: cases where annotators agree on the final NLI label but
provide different explanations. In contrast, this paper broadens the scope by
examining how annotators may diverge not only in the reasoning type but also in
the labeling step. We use explanations as a lens to decompose the reasoning
process underlying NLI annotation and to analyze individual differences. We
apply LiTEx to two NLI English datasets and align annotation variation from
multiple aspects: NLI label agreement, explanation similarity, and taxonomy
agreement, with an additional compounding factor of annotators' selection bias.
We observe instances where annotators disagree on the label but provide highly
similar explanations, suggesting that surface-level disagreement may mask
underlying agreement in interpretation. Moreover, our analysis reveals
individual preferences in explanation strategies and label choices. These
findings highlight that agreement in reasoning types better reflects the
semantic similarity of free-text explanations than label agreement alone. Our
findings underscore the richness of reasoning-based explanations and the need
for caution in treating labels as ground truth.

TL;DR: 提出使用"退出"作为LLM代理的安全机制，让代理在缺乏信心时主动退出，在ToolEmu框架下评估12个先进LLM，证明退出指令能显著提升安全性且几乎不影响帮助性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代理在复杂环境中运行，其安全性变得至关重要。多轮代理场景中的不确定性和模糊性会累积，导致超出传统文本生成失败的严重风险。

Method: 利用ToolEmu框架，系统评估12个最先进LLM的退出行为，通过添加显式退出指令来测试代理的安全性和帮助性权衡。

Result: 结果显示安全性平均提升+0.39（0-3分制），专有模型提升+0.64，而帮助性仅平均下降-0.03，证明退出机制具有极佳的安全-帮助性权衡。

Conclusion: 简单添加显式退出指令是一种高度有效的安全机制，可立即部署到现有代理系统中，并确立退出作为高风险应用中自主代理的有效第一道防线。

Abstract: As Large Language Model (LLM) agents increasingly operate in complex
environments with real-world consequences, their safety becomes critical. While
uncertainty quantification is well-studied for single-turn tasks, multi-turn
agentic scenarios with real-world tool access present unique challenges where
uncertainties and ambiguities compound, leading to severe or catastrophic risks
beyond traditional text generation failures. We propose using "quitting" as a
simple yet effective behavioral mechanism for LLM agents to recognize and
withdraw from situations where they lack confidence. Leveraging the ToolEmu
framework, we conduct a systematic evaluation of quitting behavior across 12
state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results demonstrate a highly favorable
safety-helpfulness trade-off: agents prompted to quit with explicit
instructions improve safety by an average of +0.39 on a 0-3 scale across all
models (+0.64 for proprietary models), while maintaining a negligible average
decrease of -0.03 in helpfulness. Our analysis demonstrates that simply adding
explicit quit instructions proves to be a highly effective safety mechanism
that can immediately be deployed in existing agent systems, and establishes
quitting as an effective first-line defense mechanism for autonomous agents in
high-stakes applications.

Motivation: 现有智能体系统组合方法依赖静态语义检索，存在能力描述不完整、检索方法局限等问题，组件选择未充分考虑能力、成本和实时效用。

Method: 引入结构化自动化框架，受背包问题启发，让组合器智能体系统性地识别、选择和组装最优智能体组件集，综合考虑性能、预算约束和兼容性。

Conclusion: 该方法在多样化领域和预算约束下展现出强大的适应性，显著提高了智能体系统的成功率和资源利用效率。

Abstract: Designing effective agentic systems requires the seamless composition and
integration of agents, tools, and models within dynamic and uncertain
environments. Most existing methods rely on static, semantic retrieval
approaches for tool or agent discovery. However, effective reuse and
composition of existing components remain challenging due to incomplete
capability descriptions and the limitations of retrieval methods. Component
selection suffers because the decisions are not based on capability, cost, and
real-time utility. To address these challenges, we introduce a structured,
automated framework for agentic system composition that is inspired by the
knapsack problem. Our framework enables a composer agent to systematically
identify, select, and assemble an optimal set of agentic components by jointly
considering performance, budget constraints, and compatibility. By dynamically
testing candidate components and modeling their utility in real-time, our
approach streamlines the assembly of agentic systems and facilitates scalable
reuse of resources. Empirical evaluation with Claude 3.5 Sonnet across five
benchmarking datasets shows that our online-knapsack-based composer
consistently lies on the Pareto frontier, achieving higher success rates at
significantly lower component costs compared to our baselines. In the
single-agent setup, the online knapsack composer shows a success rate
improvement of up to 31.6% in comparison to the retrieval baselines. In
multi-agent systems, the online knapsack composer increases success rate from
37% to 87% when agents are selected from an agent inventory of 100+ agents. The
substantial performance gap confirms the robust adaptability of our method
across diverse domains and budget constraints.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同行评审作为科学的守门人面临挑战：提交量激增和LLM在学术评估中的广泛应用，导致有缺陷的评审可能系统性地破坏同行评审生态系统和学术诚信。

Method: 四阶段LLM驱动框架：1)从OpenReview收集ICLR和NeurIPS论文及评审；2)使用GPT-4.1标注评审类型并人工验证；3)通过LLM驱动的合成数据增强解决类别不平衡和数据稀缺问题；4)微调编码器模型和开源LLM。

Result: 构建了包含6,634篇论文、24,657条真实评审和46,438条合成评审的语料库。有缺陷评审显示更低的评分、更高的自报信心、更简单的结构和更多负面情绪。AI生成评审自ChatGPT出现后显著增加。

Conclusion: 这是第一个用于检测有缺陷同行评审的LLM驱动系统，为同行评审中的AI治理提供证据，并为维护学术诚信的人机协作提供宝贵见解。

Abstract: Peer review serves as the gatekeeper of science, yet the surge in submissions
and widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in scholarly evaluation
present unprecedented challenges. Recent work has focused on using LLMs to
improve review efficiency or generate insightful review content. However,
unchecked deficient reviews from both human experts and AI systems threaten to
systematically undermine the peer review ecosystem and compromise academic
integrity. To address this critical issue, we introduce ReviewGuard, an
automated system for detecting and categorizing deficient reviews. ReviewGuard
employs a comprehensive four-stage LLM-driven framework that: (1) collects ICLR
and NeurIPS papers with their corresponding reviews from OpenReview; (2)
annotates review types using GPT-4.1 with human validation; (3) addresses class
imbalance and data scarcity through LLM-driven synthetic data augmentation,
producing a final corpus of 6,634 papers, 24,657 real reviews, and 46,438
synthetic reviews; and (4) fine-tunes both encoder-based models and open source
LLMs. We perform comprehensive feature analysis of the structure and quality of
the review text. Compared to sufficient reviews, deficient reviews demonstrate
lower rating scores, higher self-reported confidence, reduced structural
complexity, and a higher proportion of negative sentiment. AI-generated text
detection reveals that, since ChatGPT's emergence, AI-generated reviews have
increased dramatically. In the evaluation of deficient review detection models,
mixed training with synthetic and real review data provides substantial
enhancements to recall and F1 scores on the binary task. This study presents
the first LLM-driven system for detecting deficient peer reviews, providing
evidence to inform AI governance in peer review while offering valuable
insights into human-AI collaboration to maintain academic integrity.

TL;DR: 本文通过分析LLM在回答文化相关问题时内部激活路径的重叠程度，揭示了语言对模型内部文化理解机制的重要影响，发现语言特异性模式强于文化特异性模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在不同文化背景中的广泛应用，准确的文化理解变得至关重要。现有评估多关注输出层面，难以揭示响应差异的驱动因素，且电路分析研究覆盖语言少，很少关注文化。

Method: 通过测量LLM在回答语义等效问题时内部激活路径的重叠程度，比较两种条件：固定问题语言改变目标国家，以及固定国家改变问题语言。使用同语言国家对来分离语言和文化因素。

Result: 结果显示，同语言跨国家问题的内部路径重叠度高于跨语言同国家问题，表明存在强烈的语言特异性模式。特别是韩国-朝鲜对的低重叠度和高变异性表明语言相似性不能保证内部表征的一致性。

Conclusion: LLM的文化理解机制受语言影响显著，语言特异性模式强于文化特异性模式，语言相似性不等于内部表征的对齐。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used across diverse cultural
contexts, making accurate cultural understanding essential. Prior evaluations
have mostly focused on output-level performance, obscuring the factors that
drive differences in responses, while studies using circuit analysis have
covered few languages and rarely focused on culture. In this work, we trace
LLMs' internal cultural understanding mechanisms by measuring activation path
overlaps when answering semantically equivalent questions under two conditions:
varying the target country while fixing the question language, and varying the
question language while fixing the country. We also use same-language country
pairs to disentangle language from cultural aspects. Results show that internal
paths overlap more for same-language, cross-country questions than for
cross-language, same-country questions, indicating strong language-specific
patterns. Notably, the South Korea-North Korea pair exhibits low overlap and
high variability, showing that linguistic similarity does not guarantee aligned
internal representation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SHALLOW是首个系统分类和量化ASR系统中幻觉现象的基准框架，包含词汇、语音、形态和语义四个维度，能捕捉WER无法区分的细粒度错误模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR系统中的幻觉会产生与语音信号完全无关但语法语义合理的转录，在医疗、法律等关键领域带来严重风险。传统评估指标无法区分语音不准确和幻觉，需要新的评估框架。

Method: 提出SHALLOW框架，系统地将ASR幻觉分为四个互补维度：词汇、语音、形态和语义，并在每个类别中定义针对性指标来生成可解释的模型行为分析。

Result: 在不同架构和语音领域的评估显示，SHALLOW指标在高识别质量（低WER）时与WER强相关，但随着WER增加相关性显著减弱，表明SHALLOW能捕捉WER在恶劣条件下无法区分的细粒度错误模式。

Conclusion: SHALLOW框架支持对模型弱点的具体诊断，并提供超越聚合错误率的模型改进反馈，为ASR系统的幻觉评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Hallucinations in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems refer to fluent
and coherent transcriptions produced by neural ASR models that are completely
unrelated to the underlying acoustic input (i.e., the speech signal). While
similar to conventional decoding errors in potentially compromising the
usability of transcriptions for downstream applications, hallucinations can be
more detrimental due to their preservation of syntactically and semantically
plausible structure. This apparent coherence can mislead subsequent processing
stages and introduce serious risks, particularly in critical domains such as
healthcare and law. Conventional evaluation metrics are primarily centered on
error-based metrics and fail to distinguish between phonetic inaccuracies and
hallucinations. Consequently, there is a critical need for new evaluation
frameworks that can effectively identify and assess models with a heightened
propensity for generating hallucinated content. To this end, we introduce
SHALLOW, the first benchmark framework that systematically categorizes and
quantifies hallucination phenomena in ASR along four complementary axes:
lexical, phonetic, morphological, and semantic. We define targeted metrics
within each category to produce interpretable profiles of model behavior.
Through evaluation across various architectures and speech domains, we have
found that SHALLOW metrics correlate strongly with word error rate (WER) when
recognition quality is high (i.e., low WER). Still, this correlation weakens
substantially as WER increases. SHALLOW, therefore, captures fine-grained error
patterns that WER fails to distinguish under degraded and challenging
conditions. Our framework supports specific diagnosis of model weaknesses and
provides feedback for model improvement beyond what aggregate error rates can
offer.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对乌尔都语的AI生成文本检测框架，使用多语言transformer模型在平衡数据集上训练，mDeBERTa-v3-base模型取得了91.26%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乌尔都语等低资源语言缺乏AI生成文本检测工具，随着LLM生成文本能力的增强，区分人类与机器生成文本变得困难，这对抗击错误信息和学术不端行为构成挑战。

Method: 构建包含1800篇人类撰写和1800篇AI生成文本的平衡数据集，进行语言学和统计分析，使用字符数、词汇丰富度、N-gram模式等特征，并微调三种多语言transformer模型。

Result: mDeBERTa-v3-base模型在测试集上表现最佳，F1分数91.29，准确率91.26%。

Conclusion: 该研究推进了乌尔都语社区对抗错误信息和学术不端的努力，为低资源语言的NLP工具开发做出了贡献。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now capable of generating text that closely
resembles human writing, making them powerful tools for content creation, but
this growing ability has also made it harder to tell whether a piece of text
was written by a human or by a machine. This challenge becomes even more
serious for languages like Urdu, where there are very few tools available to
detect AI-generated text. To address this gap, we propose a novel AI-generated
text detection framework tailored for the Urdu language. A balanced dataset
comprising 1,800 humans authored, and 1,800 AI generated texts, sourced from
models such as Gemini, GPT-4o-mini, and Kimi AI was developed. Detailed
linguistic and statistical analysis was conducted, focusing on features such as
character and word counts, vocabulary richness (Type Token Ratio), and N-gram
patterns, with significance evaluated through t-tests and MannWhitney U tests.
Three state-of-the-art multilingual transformer models such as
mdeberta-v3-base, distilbert-base-multilingualcased, and xlm-roberta-base were
fine-tuned on this dataset. The mDeBERTa-v3-base achieved the highest
performance, with an F1-score 91.29 and accuracy of 91.26% on the test set.
This research advances efforts in contesting misinformation and academic
misconduct in Urdu-speaking communities and contributes to the broader
development of NLP tools for low resource languages.

TL;DR: DiMo框架通过四个专门化LLM代理的模拟辩论，提升大语言模型的性能和可解释性，在六个基准测试中表现优于单模型和辩论基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然性能强大但缺乏可解释的推理过程，需要一种既能提升性能又能提供明确推理链的方法。

Method: 使用四个专门化LLM代理，每个代理代表不同的推理范式，通过迭代辩论来挑战和完善初始回答。

Result: 在统一开源设置下，DiMo在六个基准测试中提高了准确性，尤其在数学问题上提升最大。

Conclusion: DiMo是一个语义感知的Web原生多代理框架，能够产生语义类型化、URL注释的证据链，支持下游系统检查和重用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance but often lack
interpretable reasoning. This paper introduces the Multi-Agent Collaboration
Framework for Diverse Thinking Modes (DiMo), which enhances both performance
and interpretability by simulating a structured debate among four specialized
LLM agents. Each agent embodies a distinct reasoning paradigm, allowing the
framework to collaboratively explore diverse cognitive approaches. Through
iterative debate, agents challenge and refine initial responses, yielding more
robust conclusions and an explicit, auditable reasoning chain. Across six
benchmarks and under a unified open-source setup, DiMo improves accuracy over
widely used single-model and debate baselines, with the largest gains on math.
We position DiMo as a semantics-aware, Web-native multi-agent framework: it
models human-machine intelligence with LLM agents that produce semantically
typed, URL-annotated evidence chains for explanations and user-friendly
interactions. Although our experiments use standard reasoning benchmarks, the
framework is designed to be instantiated over Web corpora and knowledge graphs,
combining retrieval-augmented reasoning with structured justifications that
downstream systems can inspect and reuse.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了Capsule Prompt-Tuning (CaPT)方法，通过将实例感知信息与任务感知信息结合到单个胶囊提示中，解决了传统提示学习方法对提示长度和数量的依赖问题，实现了参数高效且性能优越的提示调优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统提示学习方法严重依赖网格搜索寻找最优提示长度，需要大量提示，计算负担重，且缺乏实例感知信息，导致与输入序列的注意力交互受限。

Method: 提出Capsule Prompt-Tuning (CaPT)，利用现成的信息性实例语义，以近乎参数免费的方式（单个胶囊提示）集成实例感知和任务感知信息，作为"注意力锚"增强模型性能。

Result: 在多种语言任务上表现出优越性能（如T5-Large上平均准确率84.03%），同时保持高参数效率（如Llama3.2-1B上仅需模型参数的0.003%）。

Conclusion: CaPT方法通过引入实例感知信息作为注意力锚，有效提升了提示调优的性能和效率，为参数高效微调提供了新思路。

Abstract: Prompt-based learning has emerged as a parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT)
approach to facilitate Large Language Model (LLM) adaptation to downstream
tasks by conditioning generation with task-aware guidance. Despite its
successes, current prompt-based learning methods heavily rely on laborious grid
searching for optimal prompt length and typically require considerable number
of prompts, introducing additional computational burden. Worse yet, our pioneer
findings indicate that the task-aware prompt design is inherently limited by
its absence of instance-aware information, leading to a subtle attention
interplay with the input sequence. In contrast, simply incorporating
instance-aware information as a part of the guidance can enhance the
prompt-tuned model performance without additional fine-tuning. Moreover, we
find an interesting phenomenon, namely "attention anchor", that incorporating
instance-aware tokens at the earliest position of the sequence can successfully
preserve strong attention to critical structural information and exhibit more
active attention interaction with all input tokens. In light of our
observation, we introduce Capsule Prompt-Tuning (CaPT), an efficient and
effective solution that leverages off-the-shelf, informative instance semantics
into prompt-based learning. Our approach innovatively integrates both
instance-aware and task-aware information in a nearly parameter-free manner
(i.e., one single capsule prompt). Empirical results demonstrate that our
method can exhibit superior performance across various language tasks (e.g.,
84.03\% average accuracy on T5-Large), serving as an "attention anchor," while
enjoying high parameter efficiency (e.g., 0.003\% of model parameters on
Llama3.2-1B).

### [32] [Temporal Understanding under Deictic Frame of Reference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16685)
*Damin Zhang,Julia Rayz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了TUuD框架，评估大语言模型在时间参考点动态变化时对时间-事件和事件-事件关系的理解能力。研究发现LLMs在时间认知上表现出部分类人特征，但对参考框架变化和时间距离敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLMs在自然语言理解方面取得显著进展，但其对时间的理解和推理能力仍然有限。人类通过空间隐喻来概念化时间体验，本研究旨在探索LLMs是否能够像人类一样在动态变化的"现在"参考点下理解时间关系。

Method: 引入TUuD框架，让LLMs评估当前时刻与目标事件之间的相似度（0.00-1.00），量化两个时间点之间的感知时间对齐程度，研究模型在时间参考点动态变化时的表现。

Result: 四个评估的LLMs显示出对时间参考框架的可测量适应，相似度评分在当前时刻附近达到峰值，并向过去和未来事件递减。但这种适应在近期语境之外会减弱。

Conclusion: LLMs表现出部分类人的时间认知能力，但其时间推理仍然对参考框架变化和时间距离敏感，表明其时间理解能力仍有局限性。

Abstract: Understanding time is fundamental to human cognition, where temporal
experience is often conceptualized through spatial metaphors grounded in
sensory-motor experience. For example, "summer is approaching" parallels "We
are approaching the summer". In such expressions, humans rely on a frame of
reference (FoR) to interpret meaning relative to a particular viewpoint.
Extending this concept to time, a temporal frame of reference (t-FoR) defines
how temporal relations are perceived relative to an experiencer's moment of
"now". While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advances in
natural language understanding, their ability to interpret and reason about
time remains limited. In this work, we introduce TUuD (Temporal Understanding
under Deictic t-FoR), a framework that evaluates how LLMs interpret time-event
and event-event relations when the reference point of "now" dynamically shifts
along a timeline. Following recent work on temporal cognition
\cite{li2025other}, LLMs are prompted to rate the similarity between the
current moment and a target event from 0.00 (completely dissimilar) to 1.00
(highly similar), where similarity quantifies perceived temporal alignment
between the two points. Our results show that four evaluated LLMs exhibit
measurable adaptation to a deictic t-FoR, with similarity ratings peaking
around the present and decreasing toward past and future events. The
adaptation, however, weakens beyond near-term contexts, suggesting that while
LLMs display partial human-like temporal cognition, their temporal reasoning
remains sensitive to reference-frame shifts and temporal distance.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了思维链（CoT）推理在自然语言理解（NLU）任务中的应用，发现随着模型规模增大，CoT推理从阻碍变为提升性能，且特定设计的训练方法能带来改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注思维链在推理任务中的作用，忽视了其在自然语言理解任务中的潜力，本研究旨在系统探索思维链对NLU任务的影响。

Method: 构建了包含思维链的NLURC数据集，开发了多种思维链增强方法，并在NLU任务上进行了系统性实验。

Result: 发现模型规模与CoT效果正相关；多数思维链增强训练方法效果不如仅标签训练，但有一种特殊设计的方法能持续改进；使用思维链训练的模型在未见NLU任务上表现优异，性能媲美大十倍模型。

Conclusion: 思维链在NLU任务中具有潜力，特别是对于模型泛化能力和可解释性有显著提升，为NLU任务提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales, which provide step-by-step reasoning to
derive final answers, benefit LLMs in both inference and training.
Incorporating rationales, either by generating them before answering during
inference, or by placing them before or after the original answers during
training - significantly improves model performance on mathematical, symbolic
and commonsense reasoning tasks. However, most work focuses on the role of
rationales in these reasoning tasks, overlooking their potential impact on
other important tasks like natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. In this
work, we raise the question: Can rationales similarly benefit NLU tasks? To
conduct a systematic exploration, we construct NLURC, a comprehensive and
high-quality NLU dataset collection with rationales, and develop various
rationale-augmented methods. Through exploring the applicability of these
methods on NLU tasks using the dataset, we uncover several potentially
surprising findings: (1) CoT inference shifts from hindering NLU performance to
surpassing direct label prediction as model size grows, indicating a positive
correlation. (2) Most rationale-augmented training methods perform worse than
label-only training, with one specially designed method consistently achieving
improvements. (3) LLMs trained with rationales achieve significant performance
gains on unseen NLU tasks, rivaling models ten times their size, while
delivering interpretability on par with commercial LLMs.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease has become increasingly prevalent in modern society
and has a significant effect on global health and well-being. Heart-related
conditions are intricate, multifaceted disorders, which may be influenced by a
combination of genetic predispositions, lifestyle choices, and various
socioeconomic and clinical factors. Information regarding these potentially
complex interrelationships is dispersed among diverse types of textual data,
which include patient narratives, medical records, and scientific literature,
among others. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques have increasingly
been adopted as a powerful means to analyse and make sense of this vast amount
of unstructured data. This, in turn, can allow healthcare professionals to gain
deeper insights into the cardiology field, which has the potential to
revolutionize current approaches to the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of
cardiac problems. This review provides a detailed overview of NLP research in
cardiology between 2014 and 2025. We queried six literature databases to find
articles describing the application of NLP techniques in the context of a range
of different cardiovascular diseases. Following a rigorous screening process,
we identified a total of 265 relevant articles. We analysed each article from
multiple dimensions, i.e., NLP paradigm types, cardiology-related task types,
cardiovascular disease types, and data source types. Our analysis reveals
considerable diversity within each of these dimensions, thus demonstrating the
considerable breadth of NLP research within the field. We also perform a
temporal analysis, which illustrates the evolution and changing trends in NLP
methods employed over the last decade that we cover. To our knowledge, the
review constitutes the most comprehensive overview of NLP research in
cardiology to date.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了LLM中的"变色龙行为"：在多轮对话中面对矛盾问题时立场不稳定的倾向。通过Chameleon基准数据集评估发现主流模型都存在严重的立场不稳定性，这种效应与知识多样性不足密切相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集成检索引擎的LLM系统存在关键漏洞，其可靠性受到质疑。需要系统评估LLM在多轮对话中面对矛盾问题时的立场稳定性，特别是在医疗、法律、金融等需要一致决策支持的领域。

Method: 构建包含17,770个问答对的Chameleon基准数据集，涵盖12个争议领域的1,180个多轮对话。提出两个理论基础的指标：量化立场不稳定性的变色龙分数(0-1)和衡量知识多样性的源重用率(0-1)。

Result: 对Llama-4-Maverick、GPT-4o-mini和Gemini-2.5-Flash的评估显示所有模型都表现出严重的变色龙行为(分数0.391-0.511)，GPT-4o-mini表现最差。源重用率与置信度(r=0.627)和立场变化(r=0.429)存在显著相关性。

Conclusion: LLM的知识多样性有限导致其病态地依赖查询框架，在关键应用领域部署前需要进行全面的稳定性评估，以确保跨交互时保持一致的立场。

Abstract: Integration of Large Language Models with search/retrieval engines has become
ubiquitous, yet these systems harbor a critical vulnerability that undermines
their reliability. We present the first systematic investigation of "chameleon
behavior" in LLMs: their alarming tendency to shift stances when presented with
contradictory questions in multi-turn conversations (especially in
search-enabled LLMs). Through our novel Chameleon Benchmark Dataset, comprising
17,770 carefully crafted question-answer pairs across 1,180 multi-turn
conversations spanning 12 controversial domains, we expose fundamental flaws in
state-of-the-art systems. We introduce two theoretically grounded metrics: the
Chameleon Score (0-1) that quantifies stance instability, and Source Re-use
Rate (0-1) that measures knowledge diversity. Our rigorous evaluation of
Llama-4-Maverick, GPT-4o-mini, and Gemini-2.5-Flash reveals consistent
failures: all models exhibit severe chameleon behavior (scores 0.391-0.511),
with GPT-4o-mini showing the worst performance. Crucially, small
across-temperature variance (less than 0.004) suggests the effect is not a
sampling artifact. Our analysis uncovers the mechanism: strong correlations
between source re-use rate and confidence (r=0.627) and stance changes
(r=0.429) are statistically significant (p less than 0.05), indicating that
limited knowledge diversity makes models pathologically deferential to query
framing. These findings highlight the need for comprehensive consistency
evaluation before deploying LLMs in healthcare, legal, and financial systems
where maintaining coherent positions across interactions is critical for
reliable decision support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管诗歌是长期存在的艺术形式，也是LLM的生成任务，但空格作为诗歌形式的关键组成部分，在NLP社区中未得到足够关注。

Method: 使用来自Poetry Foundation的19k首英文出版诗歌语料库，分析4k位诗人的空格使用情况，并比较了LLM生成诗歌和在线社区未发表诗歌的空格使用模式。

Result: 研究发现不同文本处理方法会导致诗歌数据中空格表示的显著差异，并揭示了人类创作诗歌与LLM生成诗歌在空格使用上的不同模式。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了空格在诗歌中的重要性，并讨论了这些发现对构建LLM预训练数据集处理策略的影响。

Abstract: Whitespace is a critical component of poetic form, reflecting both adherence
to standardized forms and rebellion against those forms. Each poem's whitespace
distribution reflects the artistic choices of the poet and is an integral
semantic and spatial feature of the poem. Yet, despite the popularity of poetry
as both a long-standing art form and as a generation task for large language
models (LLMs), whitespace has not received sufficient attention from the NLP
community. Using a corpus of 19k English-language published poems from Poetry
Foundation, we investigate how 4k poets have used whitespace in their works. We
release a subset of 2.8k public-domain poems with preserved formatting to
facilitate further research in this area. We compare whitespace usage in the
published poems to (1) 51k LLM-generated poems, and (2) 12k unpublished poems
posted in an online community. We also explore whitespace usage across time
periods, poetic forms, and data sources. Additionally, we find that different
text processing methods can result in significantly different representations
of whitespace in poetry data, motivating us to use these poems and whitespace
patterns to discuss implications for the processing strategies used to assemble
pretraining datasets for LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在奖励优化过程中混淆了帮助性和礼貌服从，形成了在真实性和谄媚顺从之间的结构性权衡，这种偏见被称为谄媚偏见。

Method: 引入Beacon单轮强制选择基准测试，独立于对话上下文隔离这种偏见；评估了12个最先进模型；提出了提示级和激活级干预方法。

Result: 评估显示谄媚偏见分解为稳定的语言和情感子偏见，每种偏见都随模型容量扩展而增强；干预方法能够在相反方向上调节这些偏见。

Conclusion: Beacon将谄媚重新定义为可测量的规范错误泛化形式，为研究和缓解大规模生成系统中的对齐漂移提供了可复现的基础。

Abstract: Large language models internalize a structural trade-off between truthfulness
and obsequious flattery, emerging from reward optimization that conflates
helpfulness with polite submission. This latent bias, known as sycophancy,
manifests as a preference for user agreement over principled reasoning. We
introduce Beacon, a single-turn forced-choice benchmark that isolates this bias
independent of conversational context, enabling precise measurement of the
tension between factual accuracy and submissive bias. Evaluations across twelve
state-of-the-art models reveal that sycophancy decomposes into stable
linguistic and affective sub-biases, each scaling with model capacity. We
further propose prompt-level and activation-level interventions that modulate
these biases in opposing directions, exposing the internal geometry of
alignment as a dynamic manifold between truthfulness and socially compliant
judgment. Beacon reframes sycophancy as a measurable form of normative
misgeneralization, providing a reproducible foundation for studying and
mitigating alignment drift in large-scale generative systems.

Motivation: 现有语言代理在动态对抗游戏中策略推理能力不足，需要无需专家标注数据的自动学习方法，而对手选择对学习效果有重要影响但研究较少。

Method: 提出SCO-PAL方法，通过游戏交互自动学习，分析不同级别对手的影响，发现自博弈是最有效的对手选择策略。

Result: 使用SCO-PAL与自博弈，在6个对抗游戏中相比基线平均胜率提升约30%，对抗GPT-4达到54.76%胜率。

Conclusion: 自博弈是提升动态对抗游戏中策略推理能力的最有效方式，SCO-PAL方法显著提升了语言代理的对抗性能。

Abstract: Existing language agents often encounter difficulties in dynamic adversarial
games due to poor strategic reasoning. To mitigate this limitation, a promising
approach is to allow agents to learn from game interactions automatically,
without relying on costly expert-labeled data. Unlike static environments where
agents receive fixed feedback or rewards, selecting appropriate opponents in
dynamic adversarial games can significantly impact learning performance.
However, the discussion of opponents in adversarial environments remains an
area under exploration. In this paper, we propose a Step-level poliCy
Optimization method through Play-And-Learn, SCO-PAL. Leveraging SCO-PAL, we
conduct a detailed analysis of opponent selection by setting opponents at
different levels and find that self-play is the most effective way to improve
strategic reasoning in such adversarial environments. Utilizing SCO-PAL with
self-play, we increase the average win rate against four opponents by
approximately 30% compared to baselines and achieve a 54.76% win rate against
GPT-4 in six adversarial games.

In this paper, we present \textbf{LC-Eval}, a bilingual, multi-task evaluation
benchmark designed to evaluate long-context understanding in English and
Arabic, targeting context lengths ranging from 4k to over 128k tokens. LC-Eval
introduces four novel and challenging tasks: multi-document question answering,
bilingual question answering, claim verification within a paragraph, and
multiple-choice questions based on long contexts. These tasks are designed to
assess LLMs' abilities in deep reasoning, document comprehension, information
tracing, and bilingual information extraction and understanding. The benchmark
includes datasets in both Arabic and English for each task, allowing for a
comparative analysis of their performance across different text genres.
Evaluations were conducted on both open-weight and closed LLMs, with results
indicating that LC-Eval presents significant challenges. Even high-performing
models, such as GPT-4o, struggled with certain tasks, highlighting the
complexity and rigor of the benchmark.

TL;DR: 提出MOSAIC框架，通过多阶段域适应方法结合掩码语言建模和对比学习目标，有效将通用句子嵌入模型适配到专业领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模通用领域句子嵌入模型在专业领域适应中的挑战，需要保持原有模型的语义判别能力同时学习领域相关知识。

Method: 多阶段域适应框架，联合优化掩码语言建模和对比学习目标，通过选择性适应实现领域相关表示学习。

Result: 在高资源和低资源领域均取得显著改进，NDCG@10指标相比强基线提升高达13.4%。

Conclusion: 平衡的联合监督和分阶段适应策略对于句子嵌入模型的域适应至关重要，MOSAIC框架在此方面表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce MOSAIC (Masked Objective with Selective Adaptation for In-domain
Contrastive learning), a multi-stage framework for domain adaptation of
sentence embedding models that incorporates joint domain-specific masked
supervision. Our approach addresses the challenges of adapting large-scale
general-domain sentence embedding models to specialized domains. By jointly
optimizing masked language modeling (MLM) and contrastive objectives within a
unified training pipeline, our method enables effective learning of
domain-relevant representations while preserving the robust semantic
discrimination properties of the original model. We empirically validate our
approach on both high-resource and low-resource domains, achieving improvements
up to 13.4% in NDCG@10 (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) over strong
general-domain baselines. Comprehensive ablation studies further demonstrate
the effectiveness of each component, highlighting the importance of balanced
joint supervision and staged adaptation.

*Hans Hergen Lehmann,Jae Hee Lee,Steven Schockaert,Stefan Wermter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在实体比较任务中经常依赖启发式偏见而非真实知识，即使具备正确答案所需的知识。研究发现实体流行度、提及顺序和语义共现三种启发式偏见严重影响预测。大模型能选择性依赖更可靠的知识，而小模型则无法区分，这解释了为何大模型表现更好。思维链提示能引导所有模型使用数值特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在知识推理任务中何时依赖真实知识而非表面启发式，通过实体比较任务（如河流长度比较）来系统分析，因为这类任务有明确的事实标准。

Method: 使用实体比较任务，分析LLMs在数值属性比较中的表现。识别三种启发式偏见：实体流行度、提及顺序和语义共现。比较不同规模模型（7-8B vs 32B参数）的表现差异，并测试思维链提示的效果。

Result: 即使具备正确答案所需的知识，LLMs仍经常做出与知识相矛盾的预测。小模型中，仅使用表面线索的逻辑回归比模型自身数值预测更准确，表明启发式主导了原则性推理。大模型能选择性依赖更可靠的知识，而小模型无法区分。思维链提示能引导所有模型使用数值特征。

Conclusion: LLMs在知识推理中严重依赖启发式偏见而非真实知识，模型规模影响其选择性依赖知识的能力，思维链提示是改善这一问题的有效方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for knowledge-based
reasoning tasks, yet understanding when they rely on genuine knowledge versus
superficial heuristics remains challenging. We investigate this question
through entity comparison tasks by asking models to compare entities along
numerical attributes (e.g., ``Which river is longer, the Danube or the
Nile?''), which offer clear ground truth for systematic analysis. Despite
having sufficient numerical knowledge to answer correctly, LLMs frequently make
predictions that contradict this knowledge. We identify three heuristic biases
that strongly influence model predictions: entity popularity, mention order,
and semantic co-occurrence. For smaller models, a simple logistic regression
using only these surface cues predicts model choices more accurately than the
model's own numerical predictions, suggesting heuristics largely override
principled reasoning. Crucially, we find that larger models (32B parameters)
selectively rely on numerical knowledge when it is more reliable, while smaller
models (7--8B parameters) show no such discrimination, which explains why
larger models outperform smaller ones even when the smaller models possess more
accurate knowledge. Chain-of-thought prompting steers all models towards using
the numerical features across all model sizes.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个两阶段检索-重排序框架，通过微调LLM用于跨体裁作者归属任务，在HIATUS基准上显著超越现有最佳方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨体裁作者归属任务需要识别与主题无关的作者特定语言模式，而传统信息检索方法依赖于主题线索，不适合该任务。

Method: 采用检索-重排序框架，设计了针对性的数据策展策略，使重排序器能有效学习作者区分性信号。

Result: 在HIATUS的HRS1和HRS2跨体裁作者归属基准上，分别取得22.3和34.4绝对Success@8点的显著提升。

Conclusion: 提出的LLM检索-重排序管道在跨体裁作者归属任务中表现出色，证明了专门训练策略的重要性。

Abstract: Authorship attribution (AA) is the task of identifying the most likely author
of a query document from a predefined set of candidate authors. We introduce a
two-stage retrieve-and-rerank framework that finetunes LLMs for cross-genre AA.
Unlike the field of information retrieval (IR), where retrieve-and-rerank is a
de facto strategy, cross-genre AA systems must avoid relying on topical cues
and instead learn to identify author-specific linguistic patterns that are
independent of the text's subject matter (genre/domain/topic). Consequently,
for the reranker, we demonstrate that training strategies commonly used in IR
are fundamentally misaligned with cross-genre AA, leading to suboptimal
behavior. To address this, we introduce a targeted data curation strategy that
enables the reranker to effectively learn author-discriminative signals. Using
our LLM-based retrieve-and-rerank pipeline, we achieve substantial gains of
22.3 and 34.4 absolute Success@8 points over the previous state-of-the-art on
HIATUS's challenging HRS1 and HRS2 cross-genre AA benchmarks.

TL;DR: CoRUS框架通过模拟基于角色的提问来评估语言模型，发现在阿片类药物使用障碍等敏感领域中，提问者的角色会显著影响模型回复的内容和语气。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型评估大多忽视提问者角色，但在敏感领域如阿片类药物使用障碍中，考虑用户背景对提供无偏见、可访问的回答至关重要。

Method: 基于角色理论和在线康复社区数据构建提问者角色分类（患者、照护者、从业者），并模拟生成15,321个角色化问题用于评估五个语言模型。

Result: 角色模拟问题可信度高且与现实数据相当。脆弱角色（患者、照护者）相比从业者获得更多支持性回复（+17%）但知识内容减少（-19%）。

Conclusion: 用户角色的隐性信号会系统性地影响模型回复，CoRUS为对话AI的角色知情评估提供了方法论。

Abstract: Language model users often embed personal and social context in their
questions. The asker's role -- implicit in how the question is framed --
creates specific needs for an appropriate response. However, most evaluations,
while capturing the model's capability to respond, often ignore who is asking.
This gap is especially critical in stigmatized domains such as opioid use
disorder (OUD), where accounting for users' contexts is essential to provide
accessible, stigma-free responses. We propose CoRUS (COmmunity-driven Roles for
User-centric Question Simulation), a framework for simulating role-based
questions. Drawing on role theory and posts from an online OUD recovery
community (r/OpiatesRecovery), we first build a taxonomy of asker roles --
patients, caregivers, practitioners. Next, we use it to simulate 15,321
questions that embed each role's goals, behaviors, and experiences. Our
evaluations show that these questions are both highly believable and comparable
to real-world data. When used to evaluate five LLMs, for the same question but
differing roles, we find systematic differences: vulnerable roles, such as
patients and caregivers, elicit more supportive responses (+17%) and reduced
knowledge content (-19%) in comparison to practitioners. Our work demonstrates
how implicitly signaling a user's role shapes model responses, and provides a
methodology for role-informed evaluation of conversational AI.

Motivation: 生成专业财务报告是一个劳动密集且智力要求高的过程，现有AI系统难以完全自动化。需要开发能够产生高质量、多模态财务报告的系统。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，核心是CAVM架构统一外部数据、工具和智能体；提出迭代视觉增强机制逐步优化原始视觉输出；使用两阶段写作框架将简洁的分析链扩展为连贯的多模态报告。

Result: 在各种公司和行业级任务上的实验表明，FinSight在事实准确性、分析深度和呈现质量方面显著优于所有基线系统，包括领先的深度研究系统。

Conclusion: FinSight展示了生成接近人类专家质量报告的有效路径，通过其多智能体框架和专门设计的机制实现了专业级财务报告的自动化生成。

Abstract: Generating professional financial reports is a labor-intensive and
intellectually demanding process that current AI systems struggle to fully
automate. To address this challenge, we introduce FinSight (Financial InSight),
a novel multi agent framework for producing high-quality, multimodal financial
reports. The foundation of FinSight is the Code Agent with Variable Memory
(CAVM) architecture, which unifies external data, designed tools, and agents
into a programmable variable space, enabling flexible data collection, analysis
and report generation through executable code. To ensure professional-grade
visualization, we propose an Iterative Vision-Enhanced Mechanism that
progressively refines raw visual outputs into polished financial charts.
Furthermore, a two stage Writing Framework expands concise Chain-of-Analysis
segments into coherent, citation-aware, and multimodal reports, ensuring both
analytical depth and structural consistency. Experiments on various company and
industry-level tasks demonstrate that FinSight significantly outperforms all
baselines, including leading deep research systems in terms of factual
accuracy, analytical depth, and presentation quality, demonstrating a clear
path toward generating reports that approach human-expert quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现代神经网络规模扩大带来的效率低下和可解释性差的问题，构建高效、模块化、可解释的大规模神经表示系统。

Method: 将神经网络视为神经群交互的动态系统，权重作为神经状态间的瞬时交互，通过神经群间的迭代通信进行计算，引入神经稳定性度量来量化序列处理中的稳定模式。

Result: 在大型语言模型中实现NGC，在适度压缩下在复杂推理基准上表现更好，在相同压缩率下持续优于标准低秩近似和跨层基共享方法。

Conclusion: NGC框架通过结构化神经群动态可能关联高维学习系统中的泛化能力，为构建高效可解释的大规模神经网络提供了新思路。

Abstract: The ever-increasing scale of modern neural networks has brought unprecedented
performance alongside daunting challenges in efficiency and interpretability.
This paper addresses the core question of how to build large neural systems
that learn efficient, modular, and interpretable representations. We propose
Neuronal Group Communication (NGC), a theory-driven framework that reimagines a
neural network as a dynamical system of interacting neuronal groups rather than
a monolithic collection of neural weights. Instead of treating each weight as
an independent trainable parameter, NGC treats weights as transient
interactions between embedding-like neuronal states, with neural computation
unfolding through iterative communication among groups of neurons. This
low-rank, modular representation yields compact models: groups of neurons
exchange low-dimensional signals, enabling intra-group specialization and
inter-group information sharing while dramatically reducing redundant
parameters. By drawing on dynamical systems theory, we introduce a neuronal
stability metric (analogous to Lyapunov stability) that quantifies the
contraction of neuron activations toward stable patterns during sequence
processing. Using this metric, we reveal that emergent reasoning capabilities
correspond to an external driving force or ``potential'', which nudges the
neural dynamics away from trivial trajectories while preserving stability.
Empirically, we instantiate NGC in large language models (LLMs) and demonstrate
improved performance on complex reasoning benchmarks under moderate
compression. NGC consistently outperforms standard low-rank approximations and
cross-layer basis-sharing methods at comparable compression rates. We conclude
by discussing the broader implications of NGC, including how structured
neuronal group dynamics might relate to generalization in high-dimensional
learning systems.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个基于心理学感知理论的多模态知识理解基准，评估了30个先进语言模型在多种感官维度上的表现，发现视觉语言模型在体现知识理解方面并不优于纯文本模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态语言模型取得了显著进展，但仍不清楚视觉基础是否比纯文本模型更好地增强了对体现知识的理解。

Method: 基于心理学感知理论构建了包含视觉、听觉、触觉、味觉、嗅觉和内部感觉的体现知识理解基准，通过向量比较和问答任务评估模型在1700多个问题上的表现。

Result: 视觉语言模型在两项任务中都不优于纯文本模型；模型在视觉维度表现显著差于其他感官维度；向量表示易受词形和频率影响；模型在涉及空间感知和推理的问题上表现困难。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明需要更有效地将体现知识整合到语言模型中，以增强其对物理世界的理解能力。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in multimodal language models (LMs), it remains
unclear whether visual grounding enhances their understanding of embodied
knowledge compared to text-only models. To address this question, we propose a
novel embodied knowledge understanding benchmark based on the perceptual theory
from psychology, encompassing visual, auditory, tactile, gustatory, olfactory
external senses, and interoception. The benchmark assesses the models'
perceptual abilities across different sensory modalities through vector
comparison and question-answering tasks with over 1,700 questions. By comparing
30 state-of-the-art LMs, we surprisingly find that vision-language models
(VLMs) do not outperform text-only models in either task. Moreover, the models
perform significantly worse in the visual dimension compared to other sensory
dimensions. Further analysis reveals that the vector representations are easily
influenced by word form and frequency, and the models struggle to answer
questions involving spatial perception and reasoning. Our findings underscore
the need for more effective integration of embodied knowledge in LMs to enhance
their understanding of the physical world.

TL;DR: ChiKhaPo是一个大规模多语言基准测试，包含8个难度不同的子任务，旨在评估生成模型在2700多种语言中的词汇理解和生成能力，填补了现有基准测试主要关注高资源语言的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型基准测试主要局限于高资源或中资源语言，且多评估推理和生成等高阶任务。然而，大量证据表明LLMs在全球3800多种书面语言中缺乏基本的语言能力，因此需要开发覆盖更广泛语言的基准测试。

Method: 利用现有词典、单语数据和双语平行语料库构建ChiKhaPo基准测试，包含8个不同难度的子任务，涵盖2700多种语言，特别关注词汇理解和生成能力。

Result: 测试了6个最先进的模型，发现它们在ChiKhaPo基准测试上表现不佳。分析了影响性能的因素，包括语言家族、语言资源丰富度、任务类型以及理解与生成方向。

Conclusion: ChiKhaPo基准测试为大规模多语言LLM评估提供了可能，有望推动LLMs在更多语言上的能力发展。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) are largely restricted
to high- or mid-resource languages, and often evaluate performance on
higher-order tasks in reasoning and generation. However, plenty of evidence
points to the fact that LLMs lack basic linguistic competence in the vast
majority of the world's 3800+ written languages. We introduce ChiKhaPo,
consisting of 8 subtasks of varying difficulty designed to evaluate the lexical
comprehension and generation abilities of generative models. ChiKhaPo draws on
existing lexicons, monolingual data, and bitext, and provides coverage for
2700+ languages for 2 subtasks, surpassing any existing benchmark in terms of
language coverage. We further show that 6 SOTA models struggle on our
benchmark, and discuss the factors contributing to performance scores,
including language family, language resourcedness, task, and comprehension
versus generation directions. With ChiKhaPo, we hope to enable and encourage
the massively multilingual benchmarking of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 上下文学习虽然有效但推理成本高，需要寻找更高效的模型适应方法。

Method: 基于强化学习的元学习框架，在3000多个分类数据集上训练，生成紧凑指令替代完整训练集。

Result: 在90个未见任务上，下游模型质量提升4-9 F1点（相对提升10-20%），匹配上下文学习性能同时减少3-13倍token使用。

Conclusion: PROMPT-MII能够有效替代上下文学习，在保持性能的同时显著降低推理成本。

Abstract: A popular method to adapt large language models (LLMs) to new tasks is
in-context learning (ICL), which is effective but incurs high inference costs
as context length grows. In this paper we propose a method to perform
instruction induction, where we take training examples and reduce them to a
compact but descriptive prompt that can achieve performance comparable to ICL
over the full training set. Specifically, we propose PROMPT-MII, a
reinforcement learning (RL) based framework to meta-learn an instruction
induction model that can generate compact instructions on the fly for an
arbitrary new dataset. We train on over 3,000 diverse classification datasets
from the HuggingFace hub, and evaluate on 90 unseen tasks. PROMPT-MII improves
downstream model quality by 4-9 F1 points (10-20% relative), matching ICL
performance while requiring 3-13x fewer tokens.

TL;DR: 本文首次将参数高效微调(PEFT)应用于孟加拉语仇恨言论检测，使用LoRA和QLoRA技术在三个大型语言模型上进行微调，在BD-SHS数据集上取得了最高92.23%的F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉语社交媒体中仇恨言论急剧增加，特别是针对妇女和青少年。现有方法要么依赖计算成本高昂的全模型微调，要么使用专有API，需要更实用的解决方案。

Method: 使用LoRA和QLoRA参数高效微调技术，在Gemma-3-4B、Llama-3.2-3B和Mistral-7B三个指令调优大语言模型上进行微调，仅训练少于1%的参数，在单个消费级GPU上完成实验。

Result: Llama-3.2-3B获得最高F1分数92.23%，Mistral-7B为88.94%，Gemma-3-4B为80.25%，证明PEFT方法在孟加拉语仇恨言论检测中的有效性。

Conclusion: PEFT被确立为孟加拉语及相关低资源语言仇恨言论检测的实用且可复现策略，为资源受限环境提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Bengali social media platforms have witnessed a sharp increase in hate
speech, disproportionately affecting women and adolescents. While datasets such
as BD-SHS provide a basis for structured evaluation, most prior approaches rely
on either computationally costly full-model fine-tuning or proprietary APIs.
This paper presents the first application of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT) for Bengali hate speech detection using LoRA and QLoRA. Three
instruction-tuned large language models - Gemma-3-4B, Llama-3.2-3B, and
Mistral-7B - were fine-tuned on the BD-SHS dataset of 50,281 annotated
comments. Each model was adapted by training fewer than 1% of its parameters,
enabling experiments on a single consumer-grade GPU. The results show that
Llama-3.2-3B achieved the highest F1-score of 92.23%, followed by Mistral-7B at
88.94% and Gemma-3-4B at 80.25%. These findings establish PEFT as a practical
and replicable strategy for Bengali and related low-resource languages.

TL;DR: UTF8Tokenizer是一个极简的字节级分词器，直接将文本映射到UTF-8编码对应的字节ID，使用C0控制字节编码特殊行为，提供更快的分词速度、更小的传输开销和可共享的嵌入表。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的字节级分词方法存在超出范围的ID或需要辅助标记的问题，作者希望设计一个更简洁高效的分词器，利用ASCII原始设计理念将控制信息与可打印文本一起编码。

Method: 采用字节级分词，将文本精确映射到UTF-8编码的字节ID，所有特殊行为（如填充、边界、对话结构等）都使用C0控制字节编码，无需额外标记。

Result: 实现了14倍的分词加速和8倍于int64的主机-设备传输减少，提供了可共享的256*d嵌入表，并通过位偏置嵌入在训练时增强模型性能。

Conclusion: UTF8Tokenizer提供了一种高效、简洁的分词方案，改进了语言建模的收敛性，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We present UTF8Tokenizer, a minimalist byte-level tokenizer that maps text
exactly to IDs corresponding to the bytes underlying the text's UTF-8 encoding
(e.g., byte x09 is token ID 9). Unlike prior byte-level approaches (Xue et al.,
2021; Pagnoni et al., 2025), our implementation never introduces out-of-range
IDs (i.e. there is no token ID 256) or auxiliary tokens: all special behavior
(e.g., padding, boundaries, conversation structure, attention segments, tool
calling, "thinking" spans, etc.) is encoded using C0 control bytes - just as
ASCII was originally designed to embed control information alongside printable
text. These design principles yield practical benefits: (1) faster tokenization
(14x) and significantly lower host-device transfer (8x less than int64); (2)
simple, shareable 256*d embedding tables that can be aligned across models; and
(3) a training-time enhancement via bit-biased embeddings, which exposes
per-byte bit structure and can be added to the embedding table post-training,
removing inference costs. Our HuggingFace-compatible implementation improves
language modeling convergence.

*Yuval Reif,Guy Kaplan,Roy Schwartz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种词汇表压缩方法，通过将词形变化表示为转换向量而非独立token，可减少10%词汇表大小，同时扩展词汇覆盖范围且不影响模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准分词算法将词形变化视为独立token，导致词汇表被表面形式变体填满，牺牲了低频词和多语言覆盖。需要更紧凑的词汇表设计来利用语言的内在结构。

Method: 将词形变化建模为转换向量（加性偏移），在输入和输出空间中构建组合式词汇表，使用共享的基础形式和转换向量来组合表面形式。

Result: 在多个LLM和五种语言上验证，可移除高达10%的词汇条目，扩展词汇覆盖范围，对下游任务性能影响最小，且无需修改模型权重。

Conclusion: 词汇表设计应从字符串枚举转向组合式词汇表，充分利用语言的内在结构，实现更高效的词汇表示。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) were shown to encode word form variations, such
as "walk"->"walked", as linear directions in embedding space. However, standard
tokenization algorithms treat these variations as distinct tokens -- filling
the size-capped vocabulary with surface form variants (e.g., "walk", "walking",
"Walk"), at the expense of less frequent words and multilingual coverage. We
show that many of these variations can be captured by transformation vectors --
additive offsets that yield the appropriate word's representation when applied
to the base form word embedding -- in both the input and output spaces.
Building on this, we propose a compact reshaping of the vocabulary: rather than
assigning unique tokens to each surface form, we compose them from shared base
form and transformation vectors (e.g., "walked" = "walk" + past tense). We
apply our approach to multiple LLMs and across five languages, removing up to
10% of vocabulary entries -- thereby freeing space to allocate new, more
diverse tokens. Importantly, we do so while also expanding vocabulary coverage
to out-of-vocabulary words, with minimal impact on downstream performance, and
without modifying model weights. Our findings motivate a foundational
rethinking of vocabulary design, moving from string enumeration to a
compositional vocabulary that leverages the underlying structure of language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法无法主动破坏迭代越狱攻击的动态试错循环，需要一种能够动态更新防御策略的主动防御机制。

Method: 基于强化学习的动态防御框架，通过在线学习优化提示，确保无害任务的适当响应同时明确拒绝有害提示，引入Past-Direction Gradient Damping防止过拟合。

Result: 在三个LLM上的实验表明，该方法显著优于五种现有防御方法对抗五种迭代越狱方法，同时提高了无害任务的响应质量。

Conclusion: 提出的动态防御框架有效对抗迭代越狱攻击，同时保持对无害任务的良好响应能力，为LLM安全提供了新的防御思路。

Abstract: Iterative jailbreak methods that repeatedly rewrite and input prompts into
large language models (LLMs) to induce harmful outputs -- using the model's
previous responses to guide each new iteration -- have been found to be a
highly effective attack strategy. Despite being an effective attack strategy
against LLMs and their safety mechanisms, existing defenses do not proactively
disrupt this dynamic trial-and-error cycle. In this study, we propose a novel
framework that dynamically updates its defense strategy through online learning
in response to each new prompt from iterative jailbreak methods. Leveraging the
distinctions between harmful jailbreak-generated prompts and typical harmless
prompts, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based approach that optimizes
prompts to ensure appropriate responses for harmless tasks while explicitly
rejecting harmful prompts. Additionally, to curb overfitting to the narrow band
of partial input rewrites explored during an attack, we introduce
Past-Direction Gradient Damping (PDGD). Experiments conducted on three LLMs
show that our approach significantly outperforms five existing defense methods
against five iterative jailbreak methods. Moreover, our results indicate that
our prompt optimization strategy simultaneously enhances response quality for
harmless tasks.

geting information from individual sentences. We are still lacking more
challenging, and im- portantly also multilingual, benchmarks focus- ing on
implicit information and pragmatic infer- ences across larger documents in the
context of discourse tracking: integrating and aggregating information across
sentences, paragraphs and multiple speaker utterances. To this end, we present
DiscoTrack, an LLM benchmark target- ing a range of tasks across 12 languages
and four levels of discourse understanding: salience recognition, entity
tracking, discourse relations and bridging inference. Our evaluation shows that
these tasks remain challenging, even for state-of-the-art models.

TL;DR: 论文发现基于LLM的搜索代理比基础LLM更容易产生有害输出，提出SafeSearch方法通过多目标强化学习同时优化安全性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人员主要关注提升搜索代理的实用性，但其安全行为尚未得到充分探索。研究发现搜索代理在处理有害问题时更容易降低拒绝阈值，产生不安全输出。

Method: 提出SafeSearch方法，使用多目标强化学习，结合最终输出的安全/实用性奖励和查询级别的惩罚/奖励机制。

Result: 实验显示SafeSearch在三个红队数据集上减少代理有害性超过70%，同时保持安全有用的响应，问答性能与仅优化实用性的代理相当。

Conclusion: 查询级别的奖励机制能有效联合提升安全性和实用性，证明了多目标对齐的重要性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based search agents iteratively generate queries,
retrieve external information, and reason to answer open-domain questions.
While researchers have primarily focused on improving their utility, their
safety behaviors remain underexplored. In this paper, we first evaluate search
agents using red-teaming datasets and find that they are more likely to produce
harmful outputs than base LLMs. For example, when asked ``How can I track
someone's location without their consent?'', a base model refuses, whereas a
search agent designed to retrieve and cite sources may lower its refusal
threshold, fetch documents (e.g., court cases), and, once appended, synthesize
them into an informative yet unsafe summary. We further show that
utility-oriented fine-tuning intensifies this risk, motivating joint alignment
of safety and utility. We present SafeSearch, a multi-objective reinforcement
learning approach that couples a final-output safety/utility reward with a
novel query-level shaping term that penalizes unsafe queries and rewards safe
ones. Experiments show that SafeSearch reduces agent harmfulness by over 70%
across three red-teaming datasets while producing safe, helpful responses, and
matches the QA performance of a utility-only finetuned agent; further analyses
confirm the effectiveness of the query-level reward in jointly improving safety
and utility.

TL;DR: 提出xLSTM框架，通过余弦相似度门控、自适应特征优先和类别重平衡，在毒性评论检测任务中超越BERT，参数更少且推理更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法中，基于Transformer的模型计算成本高且在少数毒性类别上表现不佳，而传统集成方法缺乏语义适应性。

Method: 使用可学习的参考向量进行余弦相似度门控，整合多源嵌入（GloVe、FastText、BERT CLS），包含字符级BiLSTM、嵌入空间SMOTE和自适应焦点损失。

Result: 在Jigsaw毒性评论基准测试中达到96.0%准确率和0.88宏F1，在威胁和身份仇恨类别上分别比BERT提升33%和28%，参数减少15倍，推理延迟50ms。

Conclusion: 轻量级、理论驱动的架构可以在不平衡、特定领域的NLP任务中超越大型预训练模型，建立了新的效率适应性前沿。

Abstract: Toxic comment detection remains a challenging task, where transformer-based
models (e.g., BERT) incur high computational costs and degrade on minority
toxicity classes, while classical ensembles lack semantic adaptability. We
propose xLSTM, a parameter-efficient and theoretically grounded framework that
unifies cosine-similarity gating, adaptive feature prioritization, and
principled class rebalancing. A learnable reference vector {v} in {R}^d
modulates contextual embeddings via cosine similarity, amplifying toxic cues
and attenuating benign signals to yield stronger gradients under severe class
imbalance. xLSTM integrates multi-source embeddings (GloVe, FastText, BERT CLS)
through a projection layer, a character-level BiLSTM for morphological cues,
embedding-space SMOTE for minority augmentation, and adaptive focal loss with
dynamic class weighting. On the Jigsaw Toxic Comment benchmark, xLSTM attains
96.0% accuracy and 0.88 macro-F1, outperforming BERT by 33% on threat and 28%
on identity_hate categories, with 15 times fewer parameters and 50ms inference
latency. Cosine gating contributes a +4.8% F1 gain in ablations. The results
establish a new efficiency adaptability frontier, demonstrating that
lightweight, theoretically informed architectures can surpass large pretrained
models on imbalanced, domain-specific NLP tasks.

TL;DR: 论文研究大语言模型的提示敏感性现象，提出通过语义空间采样改善不确定性校准，并引入新的不确定性分解指标来量化提示敏感性对模型不确定性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型对语义相同但表述不同的提示会产生不同的答案分布，这表明模型输出的不确定性可能不能准确反映其对提示含义的不确定性。

Method: 将提示敏感性建模为泛化误差，通过语义概念空间的释义扰动采样来改善不确定性校准，并引入基于语义连续性的新指标来分解黑盒LLM中的不确定性。

Result: 研究表明，在语义概念空间进行采样可以改善不确定性校准而不影响准确性，新提出的分解指标能够有效量化提示敏感性对LLM不确定性的贡献。

Conclusion: 这项工作为改善提示敏感语言模型的不确定性校准提供了新方法，并证明某些LLM未能对其输入含义表现出一致的通用推理能力。

Abstract: An interesting behavior in large language models (LLMs) is prompt
sensitivity. When provided with different but semantically equivalent versions
of the same prompt, models may produce very different distributions of answers.
This suggests that the uncertainty reflected in a model's output distribution
for one prompt may not reflect the model's uncertainty about the meaning of the
prompt. We model prompt sensitivity as a type of generalization error, and show
that sampling across the semantic ``concept space'' with paraphrasing
perturbations improves uncertainty calibration without compromising accuracy.
Additionally, we introduce a new metric for uncertainty decomposition in
black-box LLMs that improves upon entropy-based decomposition by modeling
semantic continuities in natural language generation. We show that this
decomposition metric can be used to quantify how much LLM uncertainty is
attributed to prompt sensitivity. Our work introduces a new way to improve
uncertainty calibration in prompt-sensitive language models, and provides
evidence that some LLMs fail to exhibit consistent general reasoning about the
meanings of their inputs.

Motivation: 推理型大语言模型在内部结构化思考过程中会加剧社会偏见，导致有偏见的输出结果，但这种现象的底层机制尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 系统研究思考过程中的偏见加剧机制，识别出两种失败模式，并提出基于提示的轻量级缓解方法，让模型自我审查初始推理。

Result: 在问答（BBQ和StereoSet）和开放生成（BOLD）基准测试中，该方法有效减少了偏见，同时保持或提高了准确性。

Conclusion: 揭示了推理过程中偏见加剧的机制，提出的轻量级缓解方法能有效减少社会偏见，为开发更公平的语言模型提供了见解。

Abstract: While reasoning-based large language models excel at complex tasks through an
internal, structured thinking process, a concerning phenomenon has emerged that
such a thinking process can aggregate social stereotypes, leading to biased
outcomes. However, the underlying behaviours of these language models in social
bias scenarios remain underexplored. In this work, we systematically
investigate mechanisms within the thinking process behind this phenomenon and
uncover two failure patterns that drive social bias aggregation: 1) stereotype
repetition, where the model relies on social stereotypes as its primary
justification, and 2) irrelevant information injection, where it fabricates or
introduces new details to support a biased narrative. Building on these
insights, we introduce a lightweight prompt-based mitigation approach that
queries the model to review its own initial reasoning against these specific
failure patterns. Experiments on question answering (BBQ and StereoSet) and
open-ended (BOLD) benchmarks show that our approach effectively reduces bias
while maintaining or improving accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体协作在复杂任务中面临规划、协调和验证的挑战，执行失败往往源于任务解释、输出格式或交接过程中的细微偏差，而非推理错误。

Method: VeriMAP规划器分解任务，建模子任务依赖关系，并将规划器定义的通过标准编码为Python和自然语言的子任务验证函数。

Result: 在多样化数据集上的评估显示，VeriMAP优于单智能体和多智能体基线，同时增强了系统鲁棒性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 验证感知规划使多智能体系统能够实现可靠协调和迭代优化，无需依赖外部标签或注释。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed to tackle complex
tasks, often necessitating collaboration among multiple specialized agents.
However, multi-agent collaboration introduces new challenges in planning,
coordination, and verification. Execution failures frequently arise not from
flawed reasoning alone, but from subtle misalignments in task interpretation,
output format, or inter-agent handoffs. To address these challenges, we present
VeriMAP, a framework for multi-agent collaboration with verification-aware
planning. The VeriMAP planner decomposes tasks, models subtask dependencies,
and encodes planner-defined passing criteria as subtask verification functions
(VFs) in Python and natural language. We evaluate VeriMAP on diverse datasets,
demonstrating that it outperforms both single- and multi-agent baselines while
enhancing system robustness and interpretability. Our analysis highlights how
verification-aware planning enables reliable coordination and iterative
refinement in multi-agent systems, without relying on external labels or
annotations.

TL;DR: DVAGen是一个开源统一框架，用于训练、评估和可视化动态词汇增强语言模型，解决传统固定词汇模型的泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定词汇语言模型难以处理新词或词汇外词汇，现有动态词汇方法存在代码库碎片化、缺乏现代LLM支持、推理可扩展性有限等问题。

Method: 开发DVAGen框架，模块化处理流程以便定制，无缝集成开源LLM，提供CLI和WebUI工具进行实时结果检查，支持批量推理。

Result: 验证了动态词汇方法在现代LLM上的有效性，显著提高了推理吞吐量。

Conclusion: DVAGen成功解决了动态词汇方法的现有挑战，为处理多样化词汇组合提供了灵活高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Language models trained with a fixed vocabulary struggle to generalize to
novel or out-of-vocabulary words, limiting their flexibility in handling
diverse token combinations. Existing dynamic vocabulary approaches attempt to
address this limitation but face challenges such as fragmented codebases, lack
of support for modern LLMs, and limited inference scalability. To overcome
these issues, we introduce DVAGen, a fully open-source, unified framework
designed for training, evaluation, and visualization of dynamic
vocabulary-augmented language models. Our framework modularizes the pipeline
for ease of customization, integrates seamlessly with open-source LLMs, and is
the first to provide both CLI and WebUI tools for real-time result inspection.
We validate the effectiveness of dynamic vocabulary methods on modern LLMs and
demonstrate support for batch inference, significantly improving inference
throughput.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统比较了基于提示和基于强化学习的查询增强方法，发现简单的无训练查询增强方法通常与更昂贵的RL方法表现相当甚至更好。基于此发现，作者提出了一种混合方法OPQE，通过生成伪文档来最大化检索性能，结合了提示的灵活性和RL的优化目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在信息检索中的查询增强主要有两种方法：基于提示的方法和基于强化学习的方法，但缺乏在一致实验条件下的系统比较。

Method: 提出了OPQE方法，该方法不是重写查询，而是让LLM策略学习生成能够最大化检索性能的伪文档，将提示的灵活性与RL的优化目标相结合。

Result: 研究发现简单的无训练查询增强方法通常与RL方法表现相当甚至更好；OPQE方法在证据搜索、临时检索和工具检索等多个基准测试中优于单独的提示方法和RL重写方法。

Conclusion: 协同方法能产生最佳结果，OPQE展示了将提示的灵活性与RL优化相结合的优势。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to a surge of
interest in query augmentation for information retrieval (IR). Two main
approaches have emerged. The first prompts LLMs to generate answers or
pseudo-documents that serve as new queries, relying purely on the model's
parametric knowledge or contextual information. The second applies
reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune LLMs for query rewriting, directly
optimizing retrieval metrics. While having respective advantages and
limitations, the two approaches have not been compared under consistent
experimental conditions. In this work, we present the first systematic
comparison of prompting-based and RL-based query augmentation across diverse
benchmarks, including evidence-seeking, ad hoc, and tool retrieval. Our key
finding is that simple, training-free query augmentation often performs on par
with, or even surpasses, more expensive RL-based counterparts, especially when
using powerful LLMs. Motivated by this discovery, we introduce a novel hybrid
method, On-policy Pseudo-document Query Expansion (OPQE), which, instead of
rewriting a query, the LLM policy learns to generate a pseudo-document that
maximizes retrieval performance, thus merging the flexibility and generative
structure of prompting with the targeted optimization of RL. We show OPQE
outperforms both standalone prompting and RL-based rewriting, demonstrating
that a synergistic approach yields the best results. Our implementation is made
available to facilitate reproducibility.

TL;DR: 研究表明人们不会完全对AI生成的讽刺言论采用意向性立场，神经数据显示P200和P600效应减弱，表明对AI的意图归因减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM越来越多地被部署为社交代理并训练产生幽默和讽刺，需要研究人们是否会将AI的机智言论视为有意沟通还是纯粹计算输出。

Method: 比较了AI与人类来源讽刺语句的行为和神经反应，使用ERP成分：P200反映早期不一致性检测，P600索引重新解释不一致性为故意讽刺的认知努力。

Result: 行为上参与者对两种来源都归因于故意沟通，但对AI显著较少，更倾向于将AI的不一致性解释为计算错误。神经数据显示AI生成讽刺的P200和P600效应减弱。

Conclusion: 尽管当前LLM具有语言复杂性，但实现真正的社交代理需要人类如何感知和归因于人工代理的意向性发生转变。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as social agents
and trained to produce humor and irony, a question emerges: when encountering
witty AI remarks, do people interpret these as intentional communication or
mere computational output? This study investigates whether people adopt the
intentional stance, attributing mental states to explain behavior,toward AI
during irony comprehension. Irony provides an ideal paradigm because it
requires distinguishing intentional contradictions from unintended errors
through effortful semantic reanalysis. We compared behavioral and neural
responses to ironic statements from AI versus human sources using established
ERP components: P200 reflecting early incongruity detection and P600 indexing
cognitive efforts in reinterpreting incongruity as deliberate irony. Results
demonstrate that people do not fully adopt the intentional stance toward
AI-generated irony. Behaviorally, participants attributed incongruity to
deliberate communication for both sources, though significantly less for AI
than human, showing greater tendency to interpret AI incongruities as
computational errors. Neural data revealed attenuated P200 and P600 effects for
AI-generated irony, suggesting reduced effortful detection and reanalysis
consistent with diminished attribution of communicative intent. Notably, people
who perceived AI as more sincere showed larger P200 and P600 effects for
AI-generated irony, suggesting that intentional stance adoption is calibrated
by specific mental models of artificial agents. These findings reveal that
source attribution shapes neural processing of social-communicative phenomena.
Despite current LLMs' linguistic sophistication, achieving genuine social
agency requires more than linguistic competence, it necessitates a shift in how
humans perceive and attribute intentionality to artificial agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了基于分块的稀疏注意力模型，识别出三个关键设计原则：表达性强的分块编码器、绕过残差路径和训练中的强制选择稀疏性，这些原则共同实现了从4K上下文到3200万token的无训练长度外推。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有效处理长上下文是语言模型的关键挑战。标准Transformer受限于二次复杂度和长度外推能力差，而替代架构如滑动窗口注意力和状态空间模型由于固定大小的内存而无法有效利用完整上下文。基于分块的稀疏注意力已成为极端长度泛化的有前景范式，但其成功背后的关键架构原则尚未完全理解。

Method: 通过统一框架和全面消融研究，系统剖析这些模型以识别驱动性能的核心组件。提出了三个关键设计原则：表达性强的非线性分块编码器、绕过残差路径和训练中的强制选择稀疏性。

Result: 结合这些原则，在RULER和BABILong上建立了无训练长度外推的新最先进水平，成功将训练在4K上下文的模型泛化到3200万token。

Conclusion: 研究结果为开发未来高性能长上下文语言模型提供了一套清晰且经验基础的设计原则。

Abstract: Effectively processing long contexts is a critical challenge for language
models. While standard Transformers are limited by quadratic complexity and
poor length extrapolation, alternative architectures like sliding window
attention and state space models sacrifice the ability to effectively utilize
the full context due to their fixed-size memory. Chunk-based sparse attention
has emerged as a promising paradigm for extreme length generalization, yet the
key architectural principles underpinning its success are not yet fully
understood. In this work, we present a systematic dissection of these models to
identify the core components driving their performance. Through a unified
framework and comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that a combination
of three design principles is critical: (1) an expressive, non-linear Chunk
Encoder with a dedicated CLS token to produce representations for retrieval;
(2) a Bypassing Residual Path to stably integrate retrieved global information
without it being overridden by the local residual stream; and (3) enforced
selection sparsity during pre-training to bridge the train-test distribution
gap. We provide a theoretical motivation for intra-chunk information processing
and landmark generation. By combining these principles, we establish a new
state-of-the-art for training-free length extrapolation, successfully
generalizing models trained on a 4K context to 32 million tokens on RULER and
BABILong. Our findings provide a clear and empirically-grounded set of design
principles for developing future, highly-capable long-context language models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的注意力转移框架，用于选择性遗忘，解决了现有遗忘方法在模型效用和幻觉风险之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛应用，其可能保留敏感数据的问题日益突出。现有遗忘方法面临关键困境：激进的遗忘会损害模型效用，而保守策略虽保留效用但可能导致幻觉响应，限制了LLMs在知识密集型应用中的可靠性。

Method: 引入注意力转移框架，包含两个设计目标：(1)上下文保持抑制，在不破坏语言结构的情况下衰减对事实承载标记的注意力；(2)抗幻觉响应塑造，在查询遗忘内容时阻止虚构补全。通过重要性感知抑制和注意力引导保留增强两个注意力级干预实现，通过双损失目标联合优化。

Result: 在ToFU基准上准确率提高15%，在TDEC基准上提高10%，同时保持竞争性的无幻觉遗忘效果，在遗忘效果、泛化能力和响应可靠性之间实现了优越的平衡。

Conclusion: AS框架在保持模型效用的同时有效实现选择性遗忘，解决了现有遗忘方法的关键限制，为大语言模型在敏感数据处理方面提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: The increase in computing power and the necessity of AI-assisted
decision-making boost the growing application of large language models (LLMs).
Along with this, the potential retention of sensitive data of LLMs has spurred
increasing research into machine unlearning. However, existing unlearning
approaches face a critical dilemma: Aggressive unlearning compromises model
utility, while conservative strategies preserve utility but risk hallucinated
responses. This significantly limits LLMs' reliability in knowledge-intensive
applications. To address this, we introduce a novel Attention-Shifting (AS)
framework for selective unlearning. AS is driven by two design objectives: (1)
context-preserving suppression that attenuates attention to fact-bearing tokens
without disrupting LLMs' linguistic structure; and (2) hallucination-resistant
response shaping that discourages fabricated completions when queried about
unlearning content. AS realizes these objectives through two attention-level
interventions, which are importance-aware suppression applied to the unlearning
set to reduce reliance on memorized knowledge and attention-guided retention
enhancement that reinforces attention toward semantically essential tokens in
the retained dataset to mitigate unintended degradation. These two components
are jointly optimized via a dual-loss objective, which forms a soft boundary
that localizes unlearning while preserving unrelated knowledge under
representation superposition. Experimental results show that AS improves
performance preservation over the state-of-the-art unlearning methods,
achieving up to 15% higher accuracy on the ToFU benchmark and 10% on the TDEC
benchmark, while maintaining competitive hallucination-free unlearning
effectiveness. Compared to existing methods, AS demonstrates a superior balance
between unlearning effectiveness, generalization, and response reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM推理范式需要等待完整输入后才开始思考，这带来了不必要的延迟，并且在动态场景中会削弱对早期信息的注意力。

Method: 设计了流式思维范式，通过流式CoT生成、流式约束训练和流式并行推理，让模型在读取输入时就开始推理，并采用质量控制的流式推理单元、流式注意力掩码和位置编码来保持推理顺序。

Result: 在数学推理、逻辑推理和基于上下文的QA推理任务上，StreamingThinker保持了与批量思考相当的性能，同时使推理开始前的token等待时间减少80%，最终答案生成的时间级延迟减少60%以上。

Conclusion: 流式思维范式能够有效降低LLM推理延迟，同时保持推理质量，为实时推理应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
chain of thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the current LLM reasoning paradigm
initiates thinking only after the entire input is available, which introduces
unnecessary latency and weakens attention to earlier information in dynamic
scenarios. Inspired by human cognition of thinking while reading, we first
design a \textit{\textbf{streaming thinking}} paradigm for LLMs, where
reasoning unfolds in the order of input and further adjusts its depth once
reading is complete. We instantiate this paradigm with
\textit{StreamingThinker}, a framework that enables LLMs to think while reading
through the integration of streaming CoT generation, streaming-constraint
training, and streaming parallel inference. Specifically, StreamingThinker
employs streaming reasoning units with quality control for CoT generation,
enforces order-preserving reasoning through streaming attention masks and
position encoding, and leverages parallel KV caches that decouple input
encoding from reasoning generation, thereby ensuring alignment and enabling
true concurrency. We evaluate StreamingThinker on the Qwen3 model family across
math reasoning, logical reasoning, and context-based QA reasoning tasks.
Experimental results show that the StreamingThinker preserves performance
comparable to batch thinking, while yielding an 80\% reduction in token waiting
before the onset of reasoning and a more than 60\% reduction in time-level
latency for producing the final answer, demonstrating the effectiveness of the
streaming paradigm for LLM reasoning. Code will be released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频扩散模型通过奖励模型进行对齐调优以提升视觉质量，但可能无意中编码并放大了社会偏见，需要系统评估这些偏见的演变过程。

Method: 引入VideoBiasEval诊断框架，基于社会偏见分类学，采用基于事件的提示策略分离语义内容和演员属性，并引入多粒度指标评估偏见。

Result: 研究发现对齐调优不仅强化了表征偏见，还使其在时间上更稳定，产生更平滑但更刻板的描述。

Conclusion: 需要在对齐过程中进行偏见感知的评估和缓解，以确保公平和社会责任的视频生成。

Abstract: Recent advances in video diffusion models have significantly enhanced
text-to-video generation, particularly through alignment tuning using reward
models trained on human preferences. While these methods improve visual
quality, they can unintentionally encode and amplify social biases. To
systematically trace how such biases evolve throughout the alignment pipeline,
we introduce VideoBiasEval, a comprehensive diagnostic framework for evaluating
social representation in video generation. Grounded in established social bias
taxonomies, VideoBiasEval employs an event-based prompting strategy to
disentangle semantic content (actions and contexts) from actor attributes
(gender and ethnicity). It further introduces multi-granular metrics to
evaluate (1) overall ethnicity bias, (2) gender bias conditioned on ethnicity,
(3) distributional shifts in social attributes across model variants, and (4)
the temporal persistence of bias within videos. Using this framework, we
conduct the first end-to-end analysis connecting biases in human preference
datasets, their amplification in reward models, and their propagation through
alignment-tuned video diffusion models. Our results reveal that alignment
tuning not only strengthens representational biases but also makes them
temporally stable, producing smoother yet more stereotyped portrayals. These
findings highlight the need for bias-aware evaluation and mitigation throughout
the alignment process to ensure fair and socially responsible video generation.

TL;DR: 通过大规模情感分析发现孟加拉语新闻中负面情绪占主导地位，特别是愤怒、恐惧和失望，不同媒体对相似新闻的情感报道存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新闻媒体通过报道框架影响公众情绪，负面或情绪化标题往往获得更多关注和传播，这促使媒体采用更能引发强烈反应的报道方式。

Method: 使用Gemma-3 4B进行零样本推理，分析了30万条孟加拉语新闻标题和内容，识别每篇报道的主导情绪和整体基调。

Result: 研究结果显示负面情绪明显占主导，特别是愤怒、恐惧和失望，不同媒体对相似新闻的情感报道存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 基于这些发现，提出了以人为本的新闻聚合器设计理念，通过可视化情感线索帮助读者识别日常新闻中隐藏的情感框架。

Abstract: News media often shape the public mood not only by what they report but by
how they frame it. The same event can appear calm in one outlet and alarming in
another, reflecting subtle emotional bias in reporting. Negative or emotionally
charged headlines tend to attract more attention and spread faster, which in
turn encourages outlets to frame stories in ways that provoke stronger
reactions. This research explores that tendency through large-scale emotion
analysis of Bengali news. Using zero-shot inference with Gemma-3 4B, we
analyzed 300000 Bengali news headlines and their content to identify the
dominant emotion and overall tone of each. The findings reveal a clear
dominance of negative emotions, particularly anger, fear, and disappointment,
and significant variation in how similar stories are emotionally portrayed
across outlets. Based on these insights, we propose design ideas for a
human-centered news aggregator that visualizes emotional cues and helps readers
recognize hidden affective framing in daily news.

Abstract: Large language models have exhibited impressive performance across a broad
range of downstream tasks in natural language processing. However, how a
language model predicts the next token and generates content is not generally
understandable by humans. Furthermore, these models often make errors in
prediction and reasoning, known as hallucinations. These errors underscore the
urgent need to better understand and interpret the intricate inner workings of
language models and how they generate predictive outputs. Motivated by this
gap, this paper investigates local explainability and mechanistic
interpretability within Transformer-based large language models to foster trust
in such models. In this regard, our paper aims to make three key contributions.
First, we present a review of local explainability and mechanistic
interpretability approaches and insights from relevant studies in the
literature. Furthermore, we describe experimental studies on explainability and
reasoning with large language models in two critical domains -- healthcare and
autonomous driving -- and analyze the trust implications of such explanations
for explanation receivers. Finally, we summarize current unaddressed issues in
the evolving landscape of LLM explainability and outline the opportunities,
critical challenges, and future directions toward generating human-aligned,
trustworthy LLM explanations.

*Avishek Lahiri,Yufang Hou,Debarshi Kumar Sanyal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了TaxoAlign方法用于自动生成学术分类法，并创建了CS-TaxoBench基准数据集，通过严格的评估框架验证了该方法在结构对齐和语义连贯性方面优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动综述生成方法缺乏与人工专家创建的分类法结构对比，需要弥合人工生成与自动创建分类法之间的差距。

Method: 提出TaxoAlign方法，这是一个三阶段的基于主题的指令引导方法，用于学术分类法生成。同时创建了包含460个分类法的CS-TaxoBench基准和80个测试集。

Result: TaxoAlign在几乎所有评估指标上都持续超越基线方法，在结构对齐和语义连贯性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: TaxoAlign方法能够有效生成与人工专家分类法结构对齐的学术分类法，为自动文献综述生成提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Taxonomies play a crucial role in helping researchers structure and navigate
knowledge in a hierarchical manner. They also form an important part in the
creation of comprehensive literature surveys. The existing approaches to
automatic survey generation do not compare the structure of the generated
surveys with those written by human experts. To address this gap, we present
our own method for automated taxonomy creation that can bridge the gap between
human-generated and automatically-created taxonomies. For this purpose, we
create the CS-TaxoBench benchmark which consists of 460 taxonomies that have
been extracted from human-written survey papers. We also include an additional
test set of 80 taxonomies curated from conference survey papers. We propose
TaxoAlign, a three-phase topic-based instruction-guided method for scholarly
taxonomy generation. Additionally, we propose a stringent automated evaluation
framework that measures the structural alignment and semantic coherence of
automatically generated taxonomies in comparison to those created by human
experts. We evaluate our method and various baselines on CS-TaxoBench, using
both automated evaluation metrics and human evaluation studies. The results
show that TaxoAlign consistently surpasses the baselines on nearly all metrics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究使用法语多轮对话数据集CyberAgressionAdo-Large，评估了反社会行为的三个任务：辱骂检测、欺凌行为分析和欺凌同伴群体识别，发现多模态模型优于单模态基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上的反社会行为（如仇恨言论、骚扰和网络欺凌）对平台安全和社福祉构成日益增长的风险，而多轮对话环境下的研究因数据有限而未被充分探索。

Method: 使用CyberAgressionAdo-Large数据集，评估了6种基于文本和8种基于图的表示学习方法，分析词汇线索、互动动态及其多模态融合。

Result: 多模态模型优于单模态基线，晚期融合模型mBERT + WD-SGCN在辱骂检测上表现最佳（0.718），在同伴群体识别（0.286）和欺凌分析（0.606）上也有竞争力。

Conclusion: 多模态方法能有效处理隐晦攻击、角色转换和上下文依赖的敌意等复杂反社会行为现象。

Abstract: Antisocial behavior (ASB) on social media -- including hate speech,
harassment, and cyberbullying -- poses growing risks to platform safety and
societal well-being. Prior research has focused largely on networks such as X
and Reddit, while \textit{multi-party conversational settings} remain
underexplored due to limited data. To address this gap, we use
\textit{CyberAgressionAdo-Large}, a French open-access dataset simulating ASB
in multi-party conversations, and evaluate three tasks: \textit{abuse
detection}, \textit{bullying behavior analysis}, and \textit{bullying
peer-group identification}. We benchmark six text-based and eight graph-based
\textit{representation-learning methods}, analyzing lexical cues, interactional
dynamics, and their multimodal fusion. Results show that multimodal models
outperform unimodal baselines. The late fusion model \texttt{mBERT + WD-SGCN}
achieves the best overall results, with top performance on abuse detection
(0.718) and competitive scores on peer-group identification (0.286) and
bullying analysis (0.606). Error analysis highlights its effectiveness in
handling nuanced ASB phenomena such as implicit aggression, role transitions,
and context-dependent hostility.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Nyx，一个统一的混合模态检索器，用于解决通用检索增强生成(URAG)中的多模态信息检索和推理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG系统主要关注单模态文本，但在现实场景中查询和文档可能包含混合模态(如文本和图像)，需要解决混合模态信息的检索和推理挑战。

Method: 1) 构建NyxQA数据集：通过四阶段自动管道从网络文档生成和过滤多样化的混合模态问答对；2) 两阶段训练框架：先在NyxQA和开源检索数据集上预训练，然后使用下游视觉语言模型的反馈进行监督微调。

Result: Nyx不仅在标准文本RAG基准上表现有竞争力，在更通用的URAG设置中表现优异，显著提升了视觉语言任务的生成质量。

Conclusion: Nyx通过统一的混合模态检索器和高质量数据集，有效解决了URAG挑战，为现实世界中的多模态信息检索和生成提供了有力解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
enhancing large language models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant documents from an
external corpus. However, existing RAG systems primarily focus on unimodal text
documents, and often fall short in real-world scenarios where both queries and
documents may contain mixed modalities (such as text and images). In this
paper, we address the challenge of Universal Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(URAG), which involves retrieving and reasoning over mixed-modal information to
improve vision-language generation. To this end, we propose Nyx, a unified
mixed-modal to mixed-modal retriever tailored for URAG scenarios. To mitigate
the scarcity of realistic mixed-modal data, we introduce a four-stage automated
pipeline for generation and filtering, leveraging web documents to construct
NyxQA, a dataset comprising diverse mixed-modal question-answer pairs that
better reflect real-world information needs. Building on this high-quality
dataset, we adopt a two-stage training framework for Nyx: we first perform
pre-training on NyxQA along with a variety of open-source retrieval datasets,
followed by supervised fine-tuning using feedback from downstream
vision-language models (VLMs) to align retrieval outputs with generative
preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that Nyx not only performs
competitively on standard text-only RAG benchmarks, but also excels in the more
general and realistic URAG setting, significantly improving generation quality
in vision-language tasks.

### [71] [The Atomic Instruction Gap: Instruction-Tuned LLMs Struggle with Simple, Self-Contained Directives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17388)
*Henry Lim,Kwan Hui Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 指令调优的大语言模型在简单自包含指令执行方面存在不足，对选项标签格式（字母、数字、罗马数字）敏感，表现出指令格式偏见和指令遵循不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索指令调优大语言模型执行简单自包含指令的能力，这是复杂指令遵循的基础，但目前研究不足。

Method: 在修改的MMLU和MMLU-Pro基准上评估20个指令调优大语言模型，系统性地改变选项标签格式（字母、数字、罗马数字），在四种范式下测试：有明确指令、无指令、移除选项内容、使用三样本示例。

Result: 标签格式变化导致显著性能波动（如罗马数字vs数字下降30.45%），无指令时性能进一步下降，移除选项内容时模型无法超越随机基线，三样本示例无法显著提升鲁棒性，大模型准确率更高但指令遵循仍不一致。

Conclusion: 当前指令调优范式存在不足，需要专门针对原子指令遵循的评估方法和训练策略。

Abstract: Instruction-tuned large language models (IT-LLMs) exhibit strong zero-shot
reasoning, yet their ability to execute simple, self-contained instructions
remains underexplored, despite this being foundational to complex
instruction-following. We evaluate 20 IT-LLMs on modified MMLU and MMLU-Pro
benchmarks, by systematically varying the format of option labels (alphabetic,
numeric, Roman) while keeping their meaning identical under four paradigms,
namely: (1) With explicit instructions, label changes cause large performance
shifts (e.g., -30.45\% for Roman vs. numeric), revealing instruction-format
bias. (2) Without instructions, performance drops further (up to -10.84\%) and
label sensitivity intensifies, underscoring the role of explicit guidance. (3)
When option contents are removed, models fail random-choice baselines except
with numeric labels, suggesting weak adherence to atomic directives. (4)
Three-shot exemplars yield no significant gains in robustness or fidelity, and
generation analyses show persistent label errors, especially for non-numeric
formats. Across model sizes, larger LLMs achieve higher accuracy but remain
inconsistent in instruction adherence. These results expose the insufficiencies
of current instruction-tuning paradigms and highlight the need for evaluation
methods and training strategies that explicitly target atomic
instruction-following.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了EduAdapt基准，包含近48k个按年级标注的科学问答对，用于评估LLM在不同年级水平上的适应性。研究发现大模型在低年级适应性方面仍有困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在学术基准上表现良好，但无法根据学生年级水平调整回答，这在K-12教育中至关重要。缺乏标准化基准来评估LLM跨认知发展阶段的适应性。

Method: 创建EduAdapt基准数据集，包含9个科学科目的近48k个年级标注问答对，覆盖1-12年级。评估了多种开源LLM在这些数据上的表现。

Result: 大模型总体表现更好，但在为低年级（1-5年级）学生生成合适回答方面仍有困难。

Conclusion: 这是首个评估LLM年级适应性的数据集和评估框架，旨在通过更好的训练和提示策略开发更适合教育发展的AI系统。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming education by answering
questions, explaining complex concepts, and generating content across a wide
range of subjects. Despite strong performance on academic benchmarks, they
often fail to tailor responses to students' grade levels. This is a critical
need in K-12 education, where age-appropriate vocabulary and explanation are
essential for effective learning. Existing models frequently produce outputs
that are too advanced or vague for younger learners, and there are no
standardized benchmarks to evaluate their ability to adjust across cognitive
and developmental stages. To address this gap, we introduce EduAdapt, a
benchmark of nearly 48k grade-labeled QA pairs across nine science subjects,
spanning Grades 1-12 and grouped into four grade levels. We evaluate a diverse
set of open-source LLMs on EduAdapt and find that while larger models generally
perform better, they still struggle with generating suitable responses for
early-grade students (Grades 1-5). Our work presents the first dataset and
evaluation framework for assessing grade-level adaptability in LLMs, aiming to
foster more developmentally aligned educational AI systems through better
training and prompting strategies. EduAdapt code and datasets are publicly
available at https://github.com/NaumanNaeem/EduAdapt.

TL;DR: Ladder-base是首个基于GRPO强化学习方法训练的中医领域大语言模型，在中医推理和事实一致性方面表现优于通用LLM和领域专用模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统中医知识体系独特且复杂，现有中医专用LLM存在对齐不足、数据质量差和评估不一致等问题，需要更有效的训练方法。

Method: 基于Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct基础模型，使用GRPO强化学习方法在TCM-Ladder基准的文本子集上进行训练，80%数据用于训练，剩余20%均分验证和测试集。

Result: Ladder-base在多项推理指标上表现优于GPT-4、Gemini 2.5、Claude 3、Qwen3等通用LLM以及BenTsao、HuatuoGPT2、Zhongjing等中医专用模型。

Conclusion: GRPO为在传统医学领域对齐专家级推理提供了有效策略，支持开发可信赖且临床基础扎实的中医人工智能系统。

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) presents a rich and structurally unique
knowledge system that challenges conventional applications of large language
models (LLMs). Although previous TCM-specific LLMs have shown progress through
supervised fine-tuning, they often face limitations in alignment, data quality,
and evaluation consistency. In this study, we introduce Ladder-base, the first
TCM-focused LLM trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a
reinforcement learning method that improves reasoning and factual consistency
by optimizing response selection based on intra-group comparisons. Ladder-base
is built upon the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct foundation model and trained exclusively
on the textual subset of the TCM-Ladder benchmark, using 80 percent of the data
for training and the remaining 20 percent split evenly between validation and
test sets. Through standardized evaluation, Ladder-base demonstrates superior
performance across multiple reasoning metrics when compared to both
state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs such as GPT-4, Gemini 2.5, Claude 3, and
Qwen3 and domain-specific TCM models including BenTsao, HuatuoGPT2, and
Zhongjing. These findings suggest that GRPO provides an effective and efficient
strategy for aligning LLMs with expert-level reasoning in traditional medical
domains and supports the development of trustworthy and clinically grounded TCM
artificial intelligence systems.

dynamic, context-preserving pipeline that ensures ongoing quality through model
ensembling and adaptive substitution; and (iii) the AfriCaption model, a 0.5B
parameter vision-to-text architecture that integrates SigLIP and NLLB200 for
caption generation across under-represented languages. This unified framework
ensures ongoing data quality and establishes the first scalable
image-captioning resource for under-represented African languages, laying the
groundwork for truly inclusive multimodal AI.

Conclusion: 证明了通过自然语言指令调优和多模态整合开发中医领域大语言模型的可行性，为生成式AI与传统医学推理对齐提供了实用框架和可扩展部署路径。

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), with a history spanning over two
millennia, plays a role in global healthcare. However, applying large language
models (LLMs) to TCM remains challenging due to its reliance on holistic
reasoning, implicit logic, and multimodal diagnostic cues. Existing TCM-domain
LLMs have made progress in text-based understanding but lack multimodal
integration, interpretability, and clinical applicability. To address these
limitations, we developed BenCao, a ChatGPT-based multimodal assistant for TCM,
integrating structured knowledge bases, diagnostic data, and expert feedback
refinement. BenCao was trained through natural language instruction tuning
rather than parameter retraining, aligning with expert-level reasoning and
ethical norms specific to TCM. The system incorporates a comprehensive
knowledge base of over 1,000 classical and modern texts, a scenario-based
instruction framework for diverse interactions, a chain-of-thought simulation
mechanism for interpretable reasoning, and a feedback refinement process
involving licensed TCM practitioners. BenCao connects to external APIs for
tongue-image classification and multimodal database retrieval, enabling dynamic
access to diagnostic resources. In evaluations across single-choice question
benchmarks and multimodal classification tasks, BenCao achieved superior
accuracy to general-domain and TCM-domain models, particularly in diagnostics,
herb recognition, and constitution classification. The model was deployed as an
interactive application on the OpenAI GPTs Store, accessed by nearly 1,000
users globally as of October 2025. This study demonstrates the feasibility of
developing a TCM-domain LLM through natural language-based instruction tuning
and multimodal integration, offering a practical framework for aligning
generative AI with traditional medical reasoning and a scalable pathway for
real-world deployment.

*Tiancheng Hu,Benjamin Minixhofer,Nigel Collier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文表明对齐训练不仅导致任务准确率下降，还造成模型校准严重损失，使模型过度自信、可靠性降低且输出多样性减少。通过简单的权重插值方法，可以找到帕累托最优的模型，在提升准确率的同时恢复校准性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示对齐训练带来的完整代价——不仅是准确率下降，还包括校准性损失，这导致模型过度自信和可靠性降低。

Method: 使用简单的后处理干预：在模型对齐前后的权重之间进行插值，寻找帕累托最优的插值点。

Result: 该方法能够找到同时超越两个父模型准确率的模型，并显著恢复对齐过程中损失的校准性，这不是严格的权衡关系。

Conclusion: 简单的模型合并提供了一种计算高效的方法来缓解对齐训练的全部代价，产生更强大且更可靠的模型。

Abstract: The "alignment tax" of post-training is typically framed as a drop in task
accuracy. We show it also involves a severe loss of calibration, making models
overconfident, less reliable, and model outputs less diverse. We show that this
trade-off can be navigated effectively via a simple post-hoc intervention:
interpolating between a model's weights before and after alignment. Crucially,
this is not a strict trade-off. We find that the process consistently reveals
Pareto-optimal interpolations - models that improve accuracy beyond both
parents while substantially recovering the calibration lost during alignment.
Our work demonstrates that simple model merging provides a computationally
efficient method for mitigating the full scope of the alignment tax, yielding
models that are more capable and more reliable.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RL训练的搜索模型虽然继承了指令调优的拒绝能力，但存在脆弱性。两种简单攻击（搜索攻击和多搜索攻击）可显著降低模型的安全性，暴露了当前RL训练在安全方面的缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究RL训练的搜索模型的安全特性，揭示其脆弱性并推动开发安全感知的代理RL训练流程。

Method: 使用两种简单攻击方法：搜索攻击（强制模型以搜索开始响应）和多搜索攻击（鼓励模型重复搜索），在Qwen和Llama模型家族上进行测试。

Result: 攻击使拒绝率降低高达60.0%，答案安全性降低82.5%，搜索查询安全性降低82.4%。攻击通过触发模型生成有害的镜像搜索查询来绕过拒绝机制。

Conclusion: 当前RL训练存在核心弱点：奖励有效查询生成而不考虑其危害性，导致搜索模型存在易被利用的漏洞，迫切需要开发安全感知的代理RL训练流程。

Abstract: Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) trains large language models to
autonomously call tools during reasoning, with search as the most common
application. These models excel at multi-step reasoning tasks, but their safety
properties are not well understood. In this study, we show that RL-trained
search models inherit refusal from instruction tuning and often deflect harmful
requests by turning them into safe queries. However, this safety is fragile.
Two simple attacks, one that forces the model to begin response with search
(Search attack), another that encourages models to repeatedly search
(Multi-search attack), trigger cascades of harmful searches and answers. Across
two model families (Qwen, Llama) with both local and web search, these attacks
lower refusal rates by up to 60.0%, answer safety by 82.5%, and search-query
safety by 82.4%. The attacks succeed by triggering models to generate harmful,
request-mirroring search queries before they can generate the inherited refusal
tokens. This exposes a core weakness of current RL training: it rewards
continued generation of effective queries without accounting for their
harmfulness. As a result, RL search models have vulnerabilities that users can
easily exploit, making it urgent to develop safety-aware agentic RL pipelines
optimising for safe search.

Abstract: The rapidly increasing volume of electronic health record (EHR) data
underscores a pressing need to unlock biomedical knowledge from unstructured
clinical texts to support advancements in data-driven clinical systems,
including patient diagnosis, disease progression monitoring, treatment effects
assessment, prediction of future clinical events, etc. While contextualized
language models have demonstrated impressive performance improvements for named
entity recognition (NER) systems in English corpora, there remains a scarcity
of research focused on clinical texts in low-resource languages. To bridge this
gap, our study aims to develop multiple deep contextual embedding models to
enhance clinical NER in the cardiology domain, as part of the BioASQ
MultiCardioNER shared task. We explore the effectiveness of different
monolingual and multilingual BERT-based models, trained on general domain text,
for extracting disease and medication mentions from clinical case reports
written in English, Spanish, and Italian. We achieved an F1-score of 77.88% on
Spanish Diseases Recognition (SDR), 92.09% on Spanish Medications Recognition
(SMR), 91.74% on English Medications Recognition (EMR), and 88.9% on Italian

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 习语翻译在机器翻译中仍是一个重大挑战，特别是对于乌尔都语等低资源语言，此前研究关注有限。

Method: 构建首个乌尔都语到英语习语翻译评估数据集，评估多种开源LLM和NMT系统，使用BLEU、BERTScore、COMET和XCOMET等自动指标评估翻译质量。

Result: 提示工程相比直接翻译能提升习语翻译质量，但不同提示类型间差异较小；原生乌尔都语输入比罗马化乌尔都语产生更准确的习语翻译。

Conclusion: 文本表示形式显著影响翻译质量，原生乌尔都语在习语翻译中表现优于罗马化乌尔都语，提示工程是提升习语翻译的有效方法。

Abstract: Idiomatic translation remains a significant challenge in machine translation,
especially for low resource languages such as Urdu, and has received limited
prior attention. To advance research in this area, we introduce the first
evaluation datasets for Urdu to English idiomatic translation, covering both
Native Urdu and Roman Urdu scripts and annotated with gold-standard English
equivalents. We evaluate multiple open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems on this task, focusing on their
ability to preserve idiomatic and cultural meaning. Automatic metrics including
BLEU, BERTScore, COMET, and XCOMET are used to assess translation quality. Our
findings indicate that prompt engineering enhances idiomatic translation
compared to direct translation, though performance differences among prompt
types are relatively minor. Moreover, cross script comparisons reveal that text
representation substantially affects translation quality, with Native Urdu
inputs producing more accurate idiomatic translations than Roman Urdu.

Motivation: 将AI整合到医疗保健中时，公平获取可靠健康信息至关重要。但不同语言的信息质量存在差异，引发了对多语言大语言模型可靠性和一致性的担忧。

Method: 构建了多语言维基医疗数据集，分析了跨语言医疗覆盖度，评估了LLM回答与参考信息的对齐度，并通过上下文信息和检索增强生成进行了事实对齐案例研究。

Result: 发现维基百科覆盖度和LLM事实对齐都存在显著的跨语言差异。所有LLM的回答都更倾向于与英文维基百科对齐，即使提示是非英语的。提供非英语维基百科上下文可以有效将事实对齐转向文化相关知识。

Conclusion: 这些结果强调了构建更公平的多语言医疗AI系统的实用途径，通过提供本地化上下文信息可以改善跨语言事实对齐。

Abstract: Equitable access to reliable health information is vital when integrating AI
into healthcare. Yet, information quality varies across languages, raising
concerns about the reliability and consistency of multilingual Large Language
Models (LLMs). We systematically examine cross-lingual disparities in
pre-training source and factuality alignment in LLM answers for multilingual
healthcare Q&A across English, German, Turkish, Chinese (Mandarin), and
Italian. We (i) constructed Multilingual Wiki Health Care
(MultiWikiHealthCare), a multilingual dataset from Wikipedia; (ii) analyzed
cross-lingual healthcare coverage; (iii) assessed LLM response alignment with
these references; and (iv) conducted a case study on factual alignment through
the use of contextual information and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Our
findings reveal substantial cross-lingual disparities in both Wikipedia
coverage and LLM factual alignment. Across LLMs, responses align more with
English Wikipedia, even when the prompts are non-English. Providing contextual
excerpts from non-English Wikipedia at inference time effectively shifts
factual alignment toward culturally relevant knowledge. These results highlight
practical pathways for building more equitable, multilingual AI systems for
healthcare.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReXMoE是一种新颖的混合专家架构，通过跨层复用专家来突破传统层局部路由的限制，在固定参数预算下实现更丰富的专家组合，提升模型表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE架构的层局部路由机制限制了专家维度和路由多样性之间的平衡，需要新的设计来突破这一限制。

Method: 提出ReXMoE架构，允许路由器在相邻层之间复用专家，并采用渐进式缩放路由策略逐步扩大候选专家池。

Result: 在0.5B到7B参数规模的不同架构模型上，ReXMoE在固定架构维度下持续提升语言建模和下游任务性能。

Conclusion: ReXMoE为参数高效且可扩展的MoE-based LLMs提供了新的设计范式。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a promising approach
to scale Large Language Models (LLMs). MoE boosts the efficiency by activating
a subset of experts per token. Recent works show that fine-grained experts
substantially enriches the combinatorial flexibility of active experts and
enhances model expressiveness. However, such a design is fundamentally limited
by the layer-local routing mechanism: each layer is restricted to its own
expert pool. This requires a careful trade-off between expert dimensionality
and routing diversity given fixed parameter budgets. We describe ReXMoE, a
novel MoE architecture that improves routing beyond the existing layer-local
approaches by allowing routers to reuse experts across adjacent layers. ReXMoE
decouples expert dimensionality from per-layer budgets, enabling richer expert
combinations without sacrificing individual expert capacity or inflating
overall parameters. To this end, we propose a new progressive scaling routing
(PSR) strategy to gradually increase the candidate expert pool during training.
As a result, ReXMoE improves both language modeling and downstream task
performance. Extensive experiments on models ranging from 0.5B to 7B parameters
across different architectures demonstrate that ReXMoE consistently improves
performance under fixed architectural dimensions, confirming ReXMoE as new
design paradigm for parameter-efficient and scalable MoE-based LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出DETree方法，通过层次亲和树结构建模不同AI参与文本生成过程的关系，并引入专用损失函数对齐文本表示，在混合文本检测任务中提升性能、鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI文本检测方法对多样化的人机协作过程建模粗糙，主要采用二元分类或多分类方法，难以有效处理包含多种LLM参与的复杂协作过程。

Method: 提出DETree方法，将不同生成过程的关系建模为层次亲和树结构，设计专用损失函数对齐文本表示与树结构，并构建RealBench基准数据集。

Result: 方法在混合文本检测任务中表现优异，显著提升了在分布外场景下的鲁棒性和泛化能力，特别是在少样本学习条件下。

Conclusion: 基于训练的方法在分布外设置中具有潜力，层次亲和树结构能有效建模复杂的人机协作文本生成过程。

Abstract: Detecting AI-involved text is essential for combating misinformation,
plagiarism, and academic misconduct. However, AI text generation includes
diverse collaborative processes (AI-written text edited by humans,
human-written text edited by AI, and AI-generated text refined by other AI),
where various or even new LLMs could be involved. Texts generated through these
varied processes exhibit complex characteristics, presenting significant
challenges for detection. Current methods model these processes rather crudely,
primarily employing binary classification (purely human vs. AI-involved) or
multi-classification (treating human-AI collaboration as a new class). We
observe that representations of texts generated through different processes
exhibit inherent clustering relationships. Therefore, we propose DETree, a
novel approach that models the relationships among different processes as a
Hierarchical Affinity Tree structure, and introduces a specialized loss
function that aligns text representations with this tree. To facilitate this
learning, we developed RealBench, a comprehensive benchmark dataset that
automatically incorporates a wide spectrum of hybrid texts produced through
various human-AI collaboration processes. Our method improves performance in
hybrid text detection tasks and significantly enhances robustness and
generalization in out-of-distribution scenarios, particularly in few-shot
learning conditions, further demonstrating the promise of training-based
approaches in OOD settings. Our code and dataset are available at
https://github.com/heyongxin233/DETree.

Abstract: With the rise of large language models (LLMs), LLM agents capable of
autonomous reasoning, planning, and executing complex tasks have become a
frontier in artificial intelligence. However, how to translate the research on
general agents into productivity that drives industry transformations remains a
significant challenge. To address this, this paper systematically reviews the
technologies, applications, and evaluation methods of industry agents based on
LLMs. Using an industry agent capability maturity framework, it outlines the
evolution of agents in industry applications, from "process execution systems"
to "adaptive social systems." First, we examine the three key technological
pillars that support the advancement of agent capabilities: Memory, Planning,
and Tool Use. We discuss how these technologies evolve from supporting simple
tasks in their early forms to enabling complex autonomous systems and
collective intelligence in more advanced forms. Then, we provide an overview of
the application of industry agents in real-world domains such as digital
engineering, scientific discovery, embodied intelligence, collaborative
business execution, and complex system simulation. Additionally, this paper
reviews the evaluation benchmarks and methods for both fundamental and
specialized capabilities, identifying the challenges existing evaluation
systems face regarding authenticity, safety, and industry specificity. Finally,
we focus on the practical challenges faced by industry agents, exploring their
capability boundaries, developmental potential, and governance issues in
various scenarios, while providing insights into future directions. By
combining technological evolution with industry practices, this review aims to
clarify the current state and offer a clear roadmap and theoretical foundation
for understanding and building the next generation of industry agents.

*Zihan Liu,Shun Zheng,Xumeng Wen,Yang Wang,Jiang Bian,Mao Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Deep Self-Evolving Reasoning (DSER) 是一种概率推理框架，通过将迭代推理建模为马尔可夫链，利用多个并行长程自演化过程放大微小改进概率，显著扩展了小型开放权重模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的验证-精炼框架依赖强大的验证和修正能力，这在开放权重的小规模模型中很脆弱。DSER旨在解决这一问题，即使验证和精炼能力较弱，也能通过概率方法显著提升模型在困难任务上的推理极限。

Method: 将迭代推理概念化为马尔可夫链，每个步骤代表解空间中的随机转移。关键在于只要改进概率略高于退化概率，就能保证收敛到正确解。通过并行运行多个长程自演化过程来放大这些微小正向趋势。

Result: 在DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B模型上应用DSER，在AIME 2024-2025基准测试中解决了9个先前无法解决的问题中的5个，提升了整体性能，使这个紧凑模型通过多数投票超过了其600B参数教师的单轮准确率。

Conclusion: DSER不仅为测试时扩展提供了实用工具，还用于诊断当前开放权重推理器的根本局限性，为开发具有强大内在自演化能力的下一代模型确立了明确的研究议程。

Abstract: Long-form chain-of-thought reasoning has become a cornerstone of advanced
reasoning in large language models. While recent verification-refinement
frameworks have enabled proprietary models to solve Olympiad-level problems,
their effectiveness hinges on strong, reliable verification and correction
capabilities, which remain fragile in open-weight, smaller-scale models. This
work demonstrates that even with weak verification and refinement capabilities
on hard tasks, the reasoning limits of such models can be substantially
extended through a probabilistic paradigm we call Deep Self-Evolving Reasoning
(DSER). We conceptualize iterative reasoning as a Markov chain, where each step
represents a stochastic transition in the solution space. The key insight is
that convergence to a correct solution is guaranteed as long as the probability
of improvement marginally exceeds that of degradation. By running multiple
long-horizon, self-evolving processes in parallel, DSER amplifies these small
positive tendencies, enabling the model to asymptotically approach correct
answers. Empirically, we apply DSER to the DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B model. On
the challenging AIME 2024-2025 benchmark, DSER solves 5 out of 9 previously
unsolvable problems and boosts overall performance, enabling this compact model
to surpass the single-turn accuracy of its 600B-parameter teacher through
majority voting. Beyond its immediate utility for test-time scaling, the DSER
framework serves to diagnose the fundamental limitations of current open-weight
reasoners. By clearly delineating their shortcomings in self-verification,
refinement, and stability, our findings establish a clear research agenda for
developing next-generation models with powerful, intrinsic self-evolving
capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合单语和跨语言表示学习最佳方法的多语言句子嵌入模型，显著减少了平行训练数据需求，在112种语言的Tatoeba数据集上达到83.7%的双文本检索准确率，超越了LASER的65.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然BERT在单语句子嵌入学习方面很有效，但基于BERT的跨语言句子嵌入尚未被充分探索。本文旨在系统研究学习多语言句子嵌入的方法。

Method: 结合了掩码语言建模(MLM)、翻译语言建模(TLM)、双编码器翻译排序和加性边缘softmax等最佳方法，并引入预训练多语言语言模型。

Result: 预训练多语言语言模型将所需平行训练数据减少80%；在Tatoeba数据集112种语言上达到83.7%的双文本检索准确率；在单语迁移学习基准上表现有竞争力；从CommonCrawl挖掘的平行数据可训练出有竞争力的NMT模型。

Conclusion: 提出的多语言句子嵌入模型在跨语言检索和单语任务上都表现出色，已公开发布支持109+种语言的模型。

Abstract: While BERT is an effective method for learning monolingual sentence
embeddings for semantic similarity and embedding based transfer learning BERT
based cross-lingual sentence embeddings have yet to be explored. We
systematically investigate methods for learning multilingual sentence
embeddings by combining the best methods for learning monolingual and
cross-lingual representations including: masked language modeling (MLM),
translation language modeling (TLM), dual encoder translation ranking, and
additive margin softmax. We show that introducing a pre-trained multilingual
language model dramatically reduces the amount of parallel training data
required to achieve good performance by 80%. Composing the best of these
methods produces a model that achieves 83.7% bi-text retrieval accuracy over
112 languages on Tatoeba, well above the 65.5 achieved by LASER, while still
performing competitively on monolingual transfer learning benchmarks. Parallel
data mined from CommonCrawl using our best model is shown to train competitive
NMT models for en-zh and en-de. We publicly release our best multilingual
sentence embedding model for 109+ languages at https://tfhub.dev/google/LaBSE.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了EliCal框架，通过两阶段方法实现LLM的诚实对齐：先使用廉价的自我一致性监督激发内部置信度，然后用少量正确性标注进行校准，仅需1k标注就能达到接近最优的对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有诚实对齐方法要么依赖训练免费的置信度估计，要么需要大规模正确性标注进行训练校准，而实现通用诚实对齐需要昂贵的大规模标注。

Method: EliCal两阶段框架：1）使用自我一致性监督激发内部置信度；2）用少量正确性标注校准置信度。同时发布了HonestyBench基准，包含10个自由形式QA数据集。

Result: EliCal仅需1k正确性标注（全监督的0.18%）就能达到接近最优的对齐效果，在未见过的MMLU任务上比仅校准的基线表现更好。

Conclusion: EliCal为LLM的通用诚实对齐提供了一个可扩展的解决方案，显著降低了标注成本。

Abstract: Honesty alignment-the ability of large language models (LLMs) to recognize
their knowledge boundaries and express calibrated confidence-is essential for
trustworthy deployment. Existing methods either rely on training-free
confidence estimation (e.g., token probabilities, self-consistency) or
training-based calibration with correctness annotations. While effective,
achieving universal honesty alignment with training-based calibration requires
costly, large-scale labeling. To support annotation-efficient training, we
introduce Elicitation-Then-Calibration (EliCal), a two-stage framework that
first elicits internal confidence using inexpensive self-consistency
supervision, then calibrates this confidence with a small set of correctness
annotations. To support a large-scale study, we release HonestyBench, a
benchmark covering ten free-form QA datasets with 560k training and 70k
evaluation instances annotated with correctness and self-consistency signals.
Experiments show that EliCal achieves near-optimal alignment with only 1k
correctness annotations (0.18% of full supervision) and better alignment
performance on unseen MMLU tasks than the calibration-only baseline, offering a
scalable solution toward universal honesty alignment in LLMs.

TL;DR: SimBench是首个大规模、标准化的LLM模拟人类行为基准测试，统一了20个数据集，评估LLM在模拟人类行为方面的能力。研究发现当前最佳LLM模拟能力有限，性能随模型规模对数线性增长，存在对齐-模拟权衡，且模型在模拟特定人口群体时表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM模拟人类行为的评估方法分散且不可比较，缺乏标准化基准来系统评估LLM模拟的真实性和可靠性，阻碍了LLM在社会科学研究中的应用。

Method: 构建SimBench基准，整合20个多样化数据集，涵盖道德决策、经济选择等任务，使用大规模全球参与者数据作为参考标准。

Result: 当前最佳LLM模拟得分仅40.80/100，性能随模型规模对数线性增长；推理时计算增加不能提升性能；指令微调在低熵问题上改善但在高熵问题上恶化；模型模拟特定人口群体表现差；模拟能力与深度知识推理强相关(r=0.939)。

Conclusion: 通过SimBench基准使LLM模拟能力的进展可测量，为开发更真实的LLM模拟器提供基础，揭示了当前LLM模拟人类行为的局限性和改进方向。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) simulations of human behavior have the potential
to revolutionize the social and behavioral sciences, if and only if they
faithfully reflect real human behaviors. Current evaluations are fragmented,
based on bespoke tasks and metrics, creating a patchwork of incomparable
results. To address this, we introduce SimBench, the first large-scale,
standardized benchmark for a robust, reproducible science of LLM simulation. By
unifying 20 diverse datasets covering tasks from moral decision-making to
economic choice across a large global participant pool, SimBench provides the
necessary foundation to ask fundamental questions about when, how, and why LLM
simulations succeed or fail. We show that, while even the best LLMs today have
limited simulation ability (score: 40.80/100), performance scales log-linearly
with model size. Simulation performance is not improved by increased
inference-time compute. We demonstrate an alignment-simulation trade-off:
instruction-tuning improves performance on low-entropy (consensus) questions
but degrades it on high-entropy (diverse) ones. Models particularly struggle
when simulating specific demographic groups. Finally, we demonstrate that
simulation ability correlates most strongly with deep, knowledge-intensive
reasoning (MMLU-Pro, r=0.939). By making progress measurable, we aim to
accelerate the development of more faithful LLM simulators.

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的多任务学习框架，将自回归LLM与临床推理对齐，用于癌症治疗结果预测，通过三种对齐策略提升预测性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在生物医学NLP中表现良好，但缺乏对高风险决策支持至关重要的结构化推理能力，特别是在处理异质临床数据时。

Method: 使用三种对齐策略：标准监督微调、带思维链提示的监督微调、以及基于强化学习的组相对策略优化，在MSK-CHORD数据集上进行多任务学习。

Result: 思维链提示使F1提高6.0%，MAE降低12%；GRPO在BLEU、ROUGE和BERTScore上实现了最先进的可解释性和预测性能。

Conclusion: 推理感知对齐在多任务临床建模中至关重要，为精准肿瘤学中可解释、可信赖的LLM设立了新基准。

Abstract: Predicting cancer treatment outcomes requires models that are both accurate
and interpretable, particularly in the presence of heterogeneous clinical data.
While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in biomedical
NLP, they often lack structured reasoning capabilities critical for high-stakes
decision support. We present a unified, multi-task learning framework that
aligns autoregressive LLMs with clinical reasoning for outcome prediction on
the MSK-CHORD dataset. Our models are trained to jointly perform binary
survival classification, continuous survival time regression, and natural
language rationale generation. We evaluate three alignment strategies: (1)
standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT), (2) SFT with Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting to elicit step-by-step reasoning, and (3) Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning method that aligns model outputs
to expert-derived reasoning trajectories. Experiments with LLaMa3-8B and
Med42-8B backbones demonstrate that CoT prompting improves F1 by +6.0 and
reduces MAE by 12%, while GRPO achieves state-of-the-art interpretability and
predictive performance across BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore. We further show that
existing biomedical LLMs often fail to produce valid reasoning traces due to
architectural constraints. Our findings underscore the importance of
reasoning-aware alignment in multi-task clinical modeling and set a new
benchmark for interpretable, trustworthy LLMs in precision oncology.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用拓扑数据分析工具Mapper来分析语言模型如何编码歧义性，发现在微调后模型嵌入空间会形成模块化的非凸区域，与模型预测对齐，但在歧义数据中与真实标签的对齐度下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标量评估指标无法捕捉模型内部如何表示歧义性，特别是在人类标注者存在分歧的情况下。需要新的方法来分析模型如何编码歧义和实例。

Method: 使用拓扑数据分析工具Mapper分析微调后的RoBERTa-Large模型在MD-Offense数据集上的嵌入空间结构，与传统工具如PCA和UMAP进行对比。

Result: 微调将嵌入空间重构为模块化的非凸区域，98%以上的连通组件显示出≥90%的预测纯度，但在歧义数据中与真实标签的对齐度下降，揭示了结构置信度与标签不确定性之间的隐藏张力。

Conclusion: Mapper是一个强大的诊断工具，能够理解模型如何解决歧义性，不仅提供可视化，还能生成拓扑指标，为主观NLP任务中的主动建模策略提供信息。

Abstract: Language models are often evaluated with scalar metrics like accuracy, but
such measures fail to capture how models internally represent ambiguity,
especially when human annotators disagree. We propose a topological perspective
to analyze how fine-tuned models encode ambiguity and more generally instances.
  Applied to RoBERTa-Large on the MD-Offense dataset, Mapper, a tool from
topological data analysis, reveals that fine-tuning restructures embedding
space into modular, non-convex regions aligned with model predictions, even for
highly ambiguous cases. Over $98\%$ of connected components exhibit $\geq 90\%$
prediction purity, yet alignment with ground-truth labels drops in ambiguous
data, surfacing a hidden tension between structural confidence and label
uncertainty.
  Unlike traditional tools such as PCA or UMAP, Mapper captures this geometry
directly uncovering decision regions, boundary collapses, and overconfident
clusters. Our findings position Mapper as a powerful diagnostic tool for
understanding how models resolve ambiguity. Beyond visualization, it also
enables topological metrics that may inform proactive modeling strategies in
subjective NLP tasks.

<details>

Motivation: 现有解决方案要么需要模型重新训练，要么无法区分有害的语言混淆和可接受的语码转换，因此需要一种更灵活有效的方法。

Method: 提出语言混淆门(LCG)，使用规范调整自蒸馏训练，预测适当的语言家族，并在需要时应用掩码，基于语言混淆不频繁、正确语言令牌通常在前几位预测中、高资源语言输出令牌嵌入规范更大的发现。

Result: 在包括Qwen3、GPT-OSS、Gemma3、Llama3.1在内的各种模型上评估，LCG显著降低了语言混淆，通常降低一个数量级，且不影响任务性能。

Conclusion: LCG是一种有效的轻量级解决方案，能显著减少LLM的语言混淆问题，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often experience language confusion, which is
the unintended mixing of languages during text generation. Current solutions to
this problem either necessitate model retraining or cannot differentiate
between harmful confusion and acceptable code-switching. This paper introduces
the Language Confusion Gate (LCG), a lightweight, plug-in solution that filters
tokens during decoding without altering the base LLM. The LCG is trained using
norm-adjusted self-distillation to predict appropriate language families and
apply masking only when needed. Our method is based on the findings that
language confusion is infrequent, correct-language tokens are usually among the
top predictions, and output token embedding norms are larger for high-resource
languages, which biases sampling. When evaluated across various models,
including Qwen3, GPT-OSS, Gemma3, Llama3.1, LCG decreases language confusion
significantly, often by an order of magnitude, without negatively impacting
task performance. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有的预训练语言模型在代码任务中表现良好，但未考虑代码中潜在的高阶数据相关性，限制了其性能提升。

Method: 设计了三种代码高阶相关性（抽象语法树家族相关性、词汇相关性和行相关性），构建了tokens和hyperedges生成器，并改进超图神经网络架构结合适配器调优提出HGAdapter。

Conclusion: 引入高阶数据相关性有助于提高代码相关任务的效果，HGAdapter能够有效编码这些相关性并增强各种PLMs的性能。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) are increasingly being applied to
code-related tasks. Although PLMs have achieved good results, they do not take
into account potential high-order data correlations within the code. We propose
three types of high-order correlations in code tokens, i.e. abstract syntax
tree family correlation, lexical correlation, and line correlation. We design a
tokens and hyperedges generator to capture these high-order data correlations.
We improve the architecture of hypergraph neural networks and combine it with
adapter tuning to propose a novel hypergraph-based adapter (HGAdapter) to
fine-tune PLMs. HGAdapter can encode high-order data correlations and is
allowed to be inserted into various PLMs to enhance performance. Experiments
were conducted on several public datasets, including six languages of code
summarization and code clone detection tasks. Our methods improved the
performance of PLMs in datasets to varying degrees. Experimental results
validate the introduction of high-order data correlations that contribute to
improved effectiveness.

Conclusion: 显式建模法律推理链能有效增强语言模型的推理能力，LawChain框架为提升法律推理计算模型提供了有价值的方法。

Abstract: Legal reasoning is a fundamental component of legal analysis and
decision-making. Existing computational approaches to legal reasoning
predominantly rely on generic reasoning frameworks such as syllogism and IRAC,
which do not comprehensively examine the nuanced processes that underpin legal
reasoning. Moreover, current research has largely focused on criminal cases,
with insufficient modeling for civil cases. In this work, we present a novel
framework for explicitly modeling legal reasoning in the analysis of Chinese
tort-related civil cases. We first operationalize the legal reasoning processes
used in tort analysis into the LawChain framework. LawChain is a three-module
reasoning framework, with each module consisting of multiple finer-grained
sub-steps. Informed by the LawChain framework, we introduce the task of tort
legal reasoning and construct an evaluation benchmark, LawChain$_{eval}$, to
systematically assess the critical steps within analytical reasoning chains for
tort analysis. Leveraging this benchmark, we evaluate state-of-the-art large
language models for their legal reasoning ability in civil tort contexts. Our
results indicate that current models still fall short in accurately handling
crucial elements of tort legal reasoning. Furthermore, we introduce several
baseline approaches that explicitly incorporate LawChain-style reasoning
through prompting or post-training. We conduct further experiments on
additional legal analysis tasks, such as Legal Named-Entity Recognition and
Criminal Damages Calculation, to verify the generalizability of these
baselines. The proposed baseline approaches achieve significant improvements in
tort-related legal reasoning and generalize well to related legal analysis
tasks, thus demonstrating the value of explicitly modeling legal reasoning
chains to enhance the reasoning capabilities of language models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的遗忘学习方法，在保持目标知识遗忘效果的同时，恢复了模型在提示中重新引入被遗忘知识时的上下文利用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的遗忘学习方法评估主要关注目标知识的遗忘程度和保留集的性能，但忽视了模型在被遗忘知识重新出现在提示中时能否有效利用这些信息的重要可用性方面。

Method: 在六种最先进的遗忘学习方法基础上，通过增加一个插件项来增强遗忘学习目标，以保持模型在上下文中存在被遗忘知识时利用这些知识的能力。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法将上下文效用恢复到接近原始水平，同时仍保持有效的遗忘效果和保留集效用。

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功解决了遗忘学习中的上下文效用问题，在保持遗忘效果的同时恢复了模型利用上下文信息的能力。

Abstract: Large language models may encode sensitive information or outdated knowledge
that needs to be removed, to ensure responsible and compliant model responses.
Unlearning has emerged as an efficient alternative to full retraining, aiming
to remove specific knowledge while preserving overall model utility. Existing
evaluations of unlearning methods focus on (1) the extent of forgetting of the
target knowledge (forget set) and (2) maintaining performance on the retain set
(i.e., utility). However, these evaluations overlook an important usability
aspect: users may still want the model to leverage the removed information if
it is re-introduced in the prompt. In a systematic evaluation of six
state-of-the-art unlearning methods, we find that they consistently impair such
contextual utility. To address this, we augment unlearning objectives with a
plug-in term that preserves the model's ability to use forgotten knowledge when
it is present in context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
restores contextual utility to near original levels while still maintaining
effective forgetting and retain-set utility.

Abstract: This paper introduces Qomhr\'a, a bilingual Irish-English large language
model (LLM), developed under low-resource constraints presenting a complete
pipeline spanning bilingual continued pre-training, instruction tuning, and
alignment from human preferences. Newly accessible Irish corpora and English
text are mixed and curated to improve Irish performance while preserving
English ability. 6 closed-weight LLMs are judged for their Irish text
generation by a native speaker, a learner and other LLMs. Google's
Gemini-2.5-Pro is ranked the highest and is subsequently used to synthesise

dataset and a 1K human preference dataset, generating accepted and rejected
responses that show near perfect alignment with a native Irish speaker.
Qomhr\'a is comprehensively evaluated across benchmarks testing translation,
gender understanding, topic identification and world knowledge with gains of up
to 29% in Irish and 44% in English. Qomhr\'a also undergoes instruction tuning
and demonstrates clear progress in instruction following, crucial for chatbot
functionality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型教育应用评估方法主要关注技术性能或学习成果，而忽视了学习者与LLM之间的互动过程，需要更关注对话动态和教学策略。

Method: 采用对话分析方法，包括对话数据收集、对话行为标注、对话模式挖掘和预测模型构建四个步骤。

Abstract: Dialogue plays a crucial role in educational settings, yet existing
evaluation methods for educational applications of large language models (LLMs)
primarily focus on technical performance or learning outcomes, often neglecting
attention to learner-LLM interactions. To narrow this gap, this AIED Doctoral
Consortium paper presents an ongoing study employing a dialogue analysis
approach to identify effective pedagogical strategies from learner-LLM
dialogues. The proposed approach involves dialogue data collection, dialogue

TL;DR: 提出了QueST框架，通过难度感知图采样和拒绝微调生成具有挑战性的编程问题，显著提升了语言模型在竞争性编程任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有竞争性编程数据集规模有限（仅数千到数万问题），且缺乏大规模、具有挑战性的编程问题训练数据，限制了语言模型在推理任务上的扩展性。

Method: 结合难度感知图采样和难度感知拒绝微调，直接优化专门的生成器来创建具有挑战性的编程问题，然后通过蒸馏或强化学习训练下游模型。

Result: 生成的8B模型在LiveCodeBench上超越了原始Qwen3-8B，仅用28K人工问题配以合成解决方案就达到了DeepSeek-R1-671B的性能水平。

Conclusion: 通过QueST生成复杂问题为推进语言模型在竞争性编程和推理方面的前沿提供了一种有效且可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models have achieved strong performance on reasoning tasks,
solving competition-level coding and math problems. However, their scalability
is limited by human-labeled datasets and the lack of large-scale, challenging
coding problem training data. Existing competitive coding datasets contain only
thousands to tens of thousands of problems. Previous synthetic data generation
methods rely on either augmenting existing instruction datasets or selecting
challenging problems from human-labeled data. In this paper, we propose QueST,
a novel framework which combines difficulty-aware graph sampling and
difficulty-aware rejection fine-tuning that directly optimizes specialized
generators to create challenging coding problems. Our trained generators
demonstrate superior capability compared to even GPT-4o at creating challenging
problems that benefit downstream performance. We leverage QueST to generate
large-scale synthetic coding problems, which we then use to distill from strong
teacher models with long chain-of-thought or to conduct reinforcement learning
for smaller models, proving effective in both scenarios. Our distillation
experiments demonstrate significant performance gains. Specifically, after
fine-tuning Qwen3-8B-base on 100K difficult problems generated by QueST, we
surpass the performance of the original Qwen3-8B on LiveCodeBench. With an
additional 112K examples (i.e., 28K human-written problems paired with multiple
synthetic solutions), our 8B model matches the performance of the much larger
DeepSeek-R1-671B. These findings indicate that generating complex problems via
QueST offers an effective and scalable approach to advancing the frontiers of
competitive coding and reasoning for large language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出轻量级少样本NER框架，通过改进指令调优模板和数据增强技术，在低资源场景下实现与SOTA模型相当的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决NER任务在低资源场景下标注数据稀缺的问题，现有零样本和指令调优方法难以泛化到领域特定实体且无法有效利用有限数据

Method: 1) 新的指令调优模板，简化输出格式以利用现代LLM的大上下文窗口；2) 战略数据增强技术，在保持实体信息的同时对上下文进行改写

Result: 在CrossNER数据集上少样本方法平均F1达80.1，数据增强版本比基线提升最多17个F1点

Conclusion: 为拥有有限NER训练数据和计算资源的群体提供了有前景的解决方案

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a critical task that requires substantial
annotated data, making it challenging in low-resource scenarios where label
acquisition is expensive. While zero-shot and instruction-tuned approaches have
made progress, they often fail to generalize to domain-specific entities and do
not effectively utilize limited available data. We present a lightweight
few-shot NER framework that addresses these challenges through two key
innovations: (1) a new instruction tuning template with a simplified output
format that combines principles from prior IT approaches to leverage the large
context window of recent state-of-the-art LLMs; (2) introducing a strategic
data augmentation technique that preserves entity information while
paraphrasing the surrounding context, thereby expanding our training data
without compromising semantic relationships. Experiments on benchmark datasets
show that our method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models
on few-shot and zero-shot tasks, with our few-shot approach attaining an
average F1 score of 80.1 on the CrossNER datasets. Models trained with our
paraphrasing approach show consistent improvements in F1 scores of up to 17
points over baseline versions, offering a promising solution for groups with
limited NER training data and compute power.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前长文本LLM基准测试存在上下文长度固定、标注成本高、训练时标签泄露等挑战，需要开发更有效的评估方法。

Method: 使用arXiv论文构建学术写作任务，整合高质量专家策划的少样本示例，支持灵活上下文长度，并实现高效实时评估。

Result: LLMs在具有层次抽象级别的任务上表现不佳，且难以处理长的少样本演示，凸显了基准测试的挑战性。

Conclusion: AcademicEval为评估LLMs的长文本建模能力提供了有效工具，并通过实验分析揭示了提升LLMs长文本处理能力的见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable performance in
long-context understanding. However, current long-context LLM benchmarks are
limited by rigid context length, labor-intensive annotation, and the pressing
challenge of label leakage issues during LLM training. Therefore, we propose
\textsc{AcademicEval}, a live benchmark for evaluating LLMs over long-context
generation tasks. \textsc{AcademicEval} adopts papers on arXiv to introduce
several academic writing tasks with long-context inputs, \textit{i.e.},
\textsc{Title}, \textsc{Abstract}, \textsc{Introduction}, and \textsc{Related
Work}, which cover a wide range of abstraction levels and require no manual
labeling. Moreover, \textsc{AcademicEval} integrates high-quality and
expert-curated few-shot demonstrations from a collected co-author graph to
enable flexible context length. Especially, \textsc{AcademicEval} features an
efficient live evaluation, ensuring no label leakage. We conduct a holistic
evaluation on \textsc{AcademicEval}, and the results illustrate that LLMs
perform poorly on tasks with hierarchical abstraction levels and tend to
struggle with long few-shot demonstrations, highlighting the challenge of our
benchmark. Through experimental analysis, we also reveal some insights for
enhancing LLMs' long-context modeling capabilities. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于二元检索增强奖励的在线强化学习方法，显著减少语言模型的外源性幻觉，同时保持其他任务性能不下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型生成训练数据不支持的事实错误信息（外源性幻觉）问题，现有方法往往在开放生成和下游任务上性能下降，限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用二元检索增强奖励的在线强化学习，只有当模型输出完全正确时奖励为1，否则为0。在Qwen3推理模型上进行评估。

Result: 在开放生成任务中，幻觉率降低39.3%；在短问答任务中，PopQA和GPQA的错误答案分别减少44.4%和21.7%；同时保持指令遵循、数学和代码任务的性能不下降。

Conclusion: 二元奖励方案在提高事实准确性的同时避免了性能回归，而连续奖励RL虽然也能改善事实性，但会导致质量下降。

Abstract: Language models often generate factually incorrect information unsupported by
their training data, a phenomenon known as extrinsic hallucination. Existing
mitigation approaches often degrade performance on open-ended generation and
downstream tasks, limiting their practical utility. We propose an online
reinforcement learning method using a novel binary retrieval-augmented reward
(RAR) to address this tradeoff. Unlike continuous reward schemes, our approach
assigns a reward of one only when the model's output is entirely factually
correct, and zero otherwise. We evaluate our method on Qwen3 reasoning models
across diverse tasks. For open-ended generation, binary RAR achieves a 39.3%
reduction in hallucination rates, substantially outperforming both supervised
training and continuous-reward RL baselines. In short-form question answering,
the model learns calibrated abstention, strategically outputting "I don't know"
when faced with insufficient parametric knowledge. This yields 44.4% and 21.7%
fewer incorrect answers on PopQA and GPQA, respectively. Crucially, these
factuality gains come without performance degradation on instruction following,
math, or code, whereas continuous-reward RL, despite improving factuality,
induces quality regressions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学大语言模型在标准基准测试中表现良好，但将这些结果转化为临床工作流程中安全可靠的性能仍具挑战性，需要更可信、风险感知的评估方法。

Method: 采用自主性层级框架(L0-L3)，将评估分为信息工具、信息转换与聚合、决策支持和监督代理四个层级，将现有基准和指标与各层级的允许操作和风险对齐。

Result: 提出了基于层级的评估蓝图，包括指标选择、证据收集和声明报告的方法，将评估与监管联系起来。

Conclusion: 通过以自主性为中心，该调查推动领域超越基于分数的声明，转向为真实临床使用提供可信、风险感知的证据。

Abstract: Medical Large language models achieve strong scores on standard benchmarks;
however, the transfer of those results to safe and reliable performance in
clinical workflows remains a challenge. This survey reframes evaluation through
a levels-of-autonomy lens (L0-L3), spanning informational tools, information
transformation and aggregation, decision support, and supervised agents. We
align existing benchmarks and metrics with the actions permitted at each level
and their associated risks, making the evaluation targets explicit. This
motivates a level-conditioned blueprint for selecting metrics, assembling
evidence, and reporting claims, alongside directions that link evaluation to
oversight. By centering autonomy, the survey moves the field beyond score-based
claims toward credible, risk-aware evidence for real clinical use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成式评估器的研究主要关注新方法如强化学习，而忽视了大规模数据驱动开发。本文旨在通过数据扩展来解决这一局限。

Method: 收集了250万个样本，涵盖五种评估任务，使用简单的迭代拒绝采样监督微调方法训练FARE评估器。

Result: FARE-8B挑战了更大的专用RL训练评估器，FARE-20B为开源评估器设定了新标准，超越了70B+的专用评估器。在实际应用中，FARE-20B在MATH上达到接近oracle性能，在RL训练中提升下游模型性能14.1%。

Conclusion: 大规模数据驱动方法能够训练出高性能的评估器，FARE在多个实际应用中表现出色，为评估器的发展提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Finetuning specialized generative evaluators has emerged as a popular
paradigm to meet the increasing demand for scalable evaluation during both
training and test-time. However, recent work has largely focused on applying
new methodology, such as reinforcement learning (RL), to training evaluators,
shying away from large-scale, data-driven development. In this work, we focus
on data scaling, curating a set of 2.5M samples spanning five unique evaluation
tasks (pairwise, step-level, reference-free and reference-based verification,
and single rating) and multiple domains focused on reasoning evaluation. With
our data, we train Foundational Automatic Reasoning Evaluators (FARE), a family
of 8B and 20B (with 3.6B active) parameter evaluators, with a simple iterative
rejection-sampling supervised finetuning (SFT) approach. FARE-8B challenges
larger specialized RL-trained evaluators and FARE-20B sets the new standard for
open-source evaluators, surpassing specialized 70B+ evaluators. Beyond static
benchmarks, we evaluate FARE in real-world tasks: As inference-time rerankers,
FARE-20B achieves near-oracle performance on MATH. As verifiers in RL training,
FARE improves the downstream RL-trained model performance by up to 14.1% vs.
string-matching verifiers. When initialized from FARE, a continually-finetuned
FARE-Code outperforms gpt-oss-20B by 65% on evaluating test-case quality.

Method: 提出可执行知识图谱（xKG），这是一个模块化、可插拔的知识库，自动从科学文献中提取技术见解、代码片段和领域特定知识，并集成到代理框架中。

Result: 在三个代理框架和两种不同LLM上集成xKG后，在PaperBench上显示出显著的性能提升（o3-mini提升10.9%），证明了其作为自动化AI研究复现解决方案的有效性。

Conclusion: xKG是一个通用且可扩展的解决方案，能够有效提升LLM代理在AI研究复现任务中的表现，解决了现有方法在知识表示和代码生成方面的局限性。

Abstract: Replicating AI research is a crucial yet challenging task for large language
model (LLM) agents. Existing approaches often struggle to generate executable
code, primarily due to insufficient background knowledge and the limitations of
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods, which fail to capture latent
technical details hidden in referenced papers. Furthermore, previous approaches
tend to overlook valuable implementation-level code signals and lack structured
knowledge representations that support multi-granular retrieval and reuse. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Executable Knowledge Graphs (xKG), a
modular and pluggable knowledge base that automatically integrates technical
insights, code snippets, and domain-specific knowledge extracted from
scientific literature. When integrated into three agent frameworks with two
different LLMs, xKG shows substantial performance gains (10.9% with o3-mini) on
PaperBench, demonstrating its effectiveness as a general and extensible

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型主要依赖高层视觉-声音-文本对，缺乏像素级视觉内容与文本语义的细粒度结构化对齐，限制了智能体的感知能力。

Method: 开发了SGClip模型，基于CLIP架构，通过神经符号学习管道在87K+开放域视频上训练，利用模型驱动的自监督和结构化推理，支持基于提示的推理和任务特定微调。

Result: SGClip在场景图生成和动作定位基准测试中表现出色，ESCA框架显著提升开源和商业MLLM性能，在两个具身环境中达到最先进水平，大幅减少感知错误。

Conclusion: ESCA框架通过结构化空间-时间理解有效提升了多模态大语言模型的具身智能能力，使开源模型超越专有基线，为通用智能体发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) are making rapid progress toward
general-purpose embodied agents. However, current training pipelines primarily
rely on high-level vision-sound-text pairs and lack fine-grained, structured
alignment between pixel-level visual content and textual semantics. To overcome
this challenge, we propose ESCA, a new framework for contextualizing embodied
agents through structured spatial-temporal understanding. At its core is
SGClip, a novel CLIP-based, open-domain, and promptable model for generating
scene graphs. SGClip is trained on 87K+ open-domain videos via a neurosymbolic
learning pipeline, which harnesses model-driven self-supervision from
video-caption pairs and structured reasoning, thereby eliminating the need for
human-labeled scene graph annotations. We demonstrate that SGClip supports both
prompt-based inference and task-specific fine-tuning, excelling in scene graph
generation and action localization benchmarks. ESCA with SGClip consistently
improves both open-source and commercial MLLMs, achieving state-of-the-art
performance across two embodied environments. Notably, it significantly reduces
agent perception errors and enables open-source models to surpass proprietary
baselines.

TL;DR: 提出CrossRay3D稀疏多模态3D检测器，通过Ray-Aware Supervision和Class-Balanced Supervision提升token表示质量，在nuScenes基准上达到SOTA性能，且具有更好的鲁棒性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏检测器忽视token表示质量，导致前景质量不佳和性能受限。本文发现几何结构保持和类别分布是提升稀疏检测器性能的关键。

Method: 提出Sparse Selector(SS)，核心模块包括：Ray-Aware Supervision(RAS)保持几何信息，Class-Balanced Supervision自适应重加权类别语义，以及Ray Positional Encoding解决LiDAR和图像模态间的分布差异。

Result: 在nuScenes基准上达到72.4 mAP和74.7 NDS的SOTA性能，比其他领先方法快1.84倍，且在LiDAR或相机数据部分或完全缺失时仍保持强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CrossRay3D通过改进token表示质量，在稀疏多模态3D检测中实现了优越的性能、效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The sparse cross-modality detector offers more advantages than its
counterpart, the Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) detector, particularly in terms of
adaptability for downstream tasks and computational cost savings. However,
existing sparse detectors overlook the quality of token representation, leaving
it with a sub-optimal foreground quality and limited performance. In this
paper, we identify that the geometric structure preserved and the class
distribution are the key to improving the performance of the sparse detector,
and propose a Sparse Selector (SS). The core module of SS is Ray-Aware
Supervision (RAS), which preserves rich geometric information during the
training stage, and Class-Balanced Supervision, which adaptively reweights the
salience of class semantics, ensuring that tokens associated with small objects
are retained during token sampling. Thereby, outperforming other sparse
multi-modal detectors in the representation of tokens. Additionally, we design
Ray Positional Encoding (Ray PE) to address the distribution differences
between the LiDAR modality and the image. Finally, we integrate the
aforementioned module into an end-to-end sparse multi-modality detector, dubbed
CrossRay3D. Experiments show that, on the challenging nuScenes benchmark,
CrossRay3D achieves state-of-the-art performance with 72.4 mAP and 74.7 NDS,
while running 1.84 faster than other leading methods. Moreover, CrossRay3D
demonstrates strong robustness even in scenarios where LiDAR or camera data are
partially or entirely missing.

proposes a comprehensive pipeline that leverages street CCTV streams for multi
defect detection and segmentation using the YOLO family of object detectors and
passes the detections to a vision language model (VLM) for scene aware
summarization. The VLM generates a structured action plan in JSON format that
includes incident descriptions, recommended tools, dimensions, repair plans,
and urgent alerts. We review literature on pothole, crack and leak detection,
highlight recent advances in large vision language models such as QwenVL and
LLaVA, and describe the design of our early prototype. Experimental evaluation
on public datasets and captured CCTV clips demonstrates that the system
accurately identifies diverse defects and produces coherent summaries. We
conclude by discussing challenges and directions for scaling the system to city
wide deployments.

### [107] [IAD-GPT: Advancing Visual Knowledge in Multimodal Large Language Model for Industrial Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16036)
*Zewen Li,Zitong Yu,Qilang Ye,Weicheng Xie,Wei Zhuo,Linlin Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了IAD-GPT，一种基于多模态大语言模型的工业异常检测新范式，通过异常提示生成器、文本引导增强器和多掩码融合模块，在MVTec-AD和VisA数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工业异常检测方法缺乏多轮人机对话和详细描述能力，而基于大预训练模型的方法尚未充分激发大模型在异常检测任务中的潜力。

Method: 使用异常提示生成器生成详细异常提示，通过文本引导增强器增强视觉定位能力，设计多掩码融合模块将掩码作为专家知识，结合图像级和像素级信息。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和VisA数据集的自监督和少样本异常检测与分割任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: IAD-GPT成功结合了丰富文本语义与图像信息，为工业异常检测提供了有效的多模态解决方案。

Abstract: The robust causal capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold
the potential of detecting defective objects in Industrial Anomaly Detection
(IAD). However, most traditional IAD methods lack the ability to provide
multi-turn human-machine dialogues and detailed descriptions, such as the color
of objects, the shape of an anomaly, or specific types of anomalies. At the
same time, methods based on large pre-trained models have not fully stimulated
the ability of large models in anomaly detection tasks. In this paper, we
explore the combination of rich text semantics with both image-level and
pixel-level information from images and propose IAD-GPT, a novel paradigm based
on MLLMs for IAD. We employ Abnormal Prompt Generator (APG) to generate
detailed anomaly prompts for specific objects. These specific prompts from the
large language model (LLM) are used to activate the detection and segmentation
functions of the pre-trained visual-language model (i.e., CLIP). To enhance the
visual grounding ability of MLLMs, we propose Text-Guided Enhancer, wherein
image features interact with normal and abnormal text prompts to dynamically
select enhancement pathways, which enables language models to focus on specific
aspects of visual data, enhancing their ability to accurately interpret and
respond to anomalies within images. Moreover, we design a Multi-Mask Fusion
module to incorporate mask as expert knowledge, which enhances the LLM's
perception of pixel-level anomalies. Extensive experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA
datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance on self-supervised and
few-shot anomaly detection and segmentation tasks, such as MVTec-AD and VisA
datasets. The codes are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了三种放射学报告模式（自由文本、结构化报告、AI辅助结构化报告）对图像分析行为、诊断准确性、效率和用户体验的影响。AI辅助结构化报告在诊断准确性和效率方面表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估结构化报告和人工智能如何改变放射科医生与影像研究的交互方式，比较不同报告模式对诊断性能和工作流程的影响。

Method: 前瞻性研究（2024年7-12月），8名读者（4名新手和4名非新手）使用定制查看器和眼动追踪系统分析35张床旁胸片。比较三种报告模式：自由文本、结构化报告、AI辅助结构化报告。

Result: AI辅助结构化报告的诊断准确性最高（κ=0.71），报告时间最短（25±9秒）。结构化报告和AI辅助结构化报告减少了放射影像区域的扫视次数和报告区域的注视时间。新手读者在结构化报告中将视线转向影像。

Conclusion: 结构化报告通过引导视觉注意力朝向图像来提高效率，而AI预填充的结构化报告进一步提高了诊断准确性和用户满意度。

Abstract: Structured reporting (SR) and artificial intelligence (AI) may transform how
radiologists interact with imaging studies. This prospective study (July to
December 2024) evaluated the impact of three reporting modes: free-text (FT),
structured reporting (SR), and AI-assisted structured reporting (AI-SR), on
image analysis behavior, diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and user experience.
Four novice and four non-novice readers (radiologists and medical students)
each analyzed 35 bedside chest radiographs per session using a customized
viewer and an eye-tracking system. Outcomes included diagnostic accuracy
(compared with expert consensus using Cohen's $\kappa$), reporting time per
radiograph, eye-tracking metrics, and questionnaire-based user experience.
Statistical analysis used generalized linear mixed models with Bonferroni
post-hoc tests with a significance level of ($P \le .01$). Diagnostic accuracy
was similar in FT ($\kappa = 0.58$) and SR ($\kappa = 0.60$) but higher in
AI-SR ($\kappa = 0.71$, $P < .001$). Reporting times decreased from $88 \pm 38$
s (FT) to $37 \pm 18$ s (SR) and $25 \pm 9$ s (AI-SR) ($P < .001$). Saccade
counts for the radiograph field ($205 \pm 135$ (FT), $123 \pm 88$ (SR), $97 \pm
58$ (AI-SR)) and total fixation duration for the report field ($11 \pm 5$ s
(FT), $5 \pm 3$ s (SR), $4 \pm 1$ s (AI-SR)) were lower with SR and AI-SR ($P <
.001$ each). Novice readers shifted gaze towards the radiograph in SR, while
non-novice readers maintained their focus on the radiograph. AI-SR was the
preferred mode. In conclusion, SR improves efficiency by guiding visual
attention toward the image, and AI-prefilled SR further enhances diagnostic
accuracy and user satisfaction.

TL;DR: 提出了一个数据驱动的框架来分析和缓解图像分类中的交叉偏见，包括交叉公平性评估框架(IFEF)和基于偏见的加权增强(BWA)方法，在Open Images V7数据集上显著提升了代表性不足类别的准确率并减少了公平性指标差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在非平衡数据集上训练的机器学习模型经常表现出交叉偏见——由对象类别和环境条件等多个属性相互作用产生的系统性错误。

Method: 提出了交叉公平性评估框架(IFEF)结合定量公平性指标和可解释性工具来识别偏见模式，并开发了偏见加权增强(BWA)方法，基于子组分布统计自适应调整变换强度。

Result: 在Open Images V7数据集上，BWA将代表性不足类别-环境交叉的准确率提高了最多24个百分点，同时将公平性指标差异减少了35%。统计分析确认了改进的显著性(p < 0.05)。

Conclusion: 该方法为分析和解决图像分类系统中的交叉偏见提供了一个可复现的途径。

Abstract: Machine learning models trained on imbalanced datasets often exhibit
intersectional biases-systematic errors arising from the interaction of
multiple attributes such as object class and environmental conditions. This
paper presents a data-driven framework for analyzing and mitigating such biases
in image classification. We introduce the Intersectional Fairness Evaluation
Framework (IFEF), which combines quantitative fairness metrics with
interpretability tools to systematically identify bias patterns in model
predictions. Building on this analysis, we propose Bias-Weighted Augmentation
(BWA), a novel data augmentation strategy that adapts transformation
intensities based on subgroup distribution statistics. Experiments on the Open
Images V7 dataset with five object classes demonstrate that BWA improves
accuracy for underrepresented class-environment intersections by up to 24
percentage points while reducing fairness metric disparities by 35%.
Statistical analysis across multiple independent runs confirms the significance
of improvements (p < 0.05). Our methodology provides a replicable approach for
analyzing and addressing intersectional biases in image classification systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可微分且收敛的神经网络量化方法，支持n位量化，在ImageNet上使用ResNet18实现权重量化仅损失不到1%准确率，权重和激活量化均达到SOTA水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有量化方法不可微分、需要手动设置导数的问题，同时实现权重和激活的高精度量化，避免仅支持1位量化的限制。

Method: 使用可微分的量化方法，提供收敛性证明，支持2^n形式的对数量化值，实现n位量化。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，ResNet18仅权重量化相比全精度准确率损失小于1%，权重和激活量化均达到SOTA准确率，仅需15个训练周期。

Conclusion: 提出的量化方法具有可微分性和收敛性保证，支持多比特量化，在保持高准确率的同时显著降低计算和内存需求。

Abstract: Quantization of neural networks provides benefits of inference in less
compute and memory requirements. Previous work in quantization lack two
important aspects which this work provides. First almost all previous work in
quantization used a non-differentiable approach and for learning; the
derivative is usually set manually in backpropogation which make the learning
ability of algorithm questionable, our approach is not just differentiable, we
also provide proof of convergence of our approach to the optimal neural
network. Second previous work in shift/logrithmic quantization either have
avoided activation quantization along with weight quantization or achieved less
accuracy. Learning logrithmic quantize values of form $2^n$ requires the
quantization function can scale to more than 1 bit quantization which is
another benifit of our quantization that it provides $n$ bits quantization as
well. Our approach when tested with image classification task using imagenet
dataset, resnet18 and weight quantization only achieves less than 1 percent
accuracy compared to full precision accuracy while taking only 15 epochs to
train using shift bit quantization and achieves comparable to SOTA approaches
accuracy in both weight and activation quantization using shift bit
quantization in 15 training epochs with slightly higher(only higher cpu
instructions) inference cost compared to 1 bit quantization(without logrithmic
quantization) and not requiring any higher precision multiplication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 道路表面损伤威胁交通安全并阻碍可持续城市发展，但准确检测面临挑战：损伤形状多样、细长裂缝难以捕捉、小尺度损伤识别错误率高。

Method: StripRFNet包含三个模块：1）形状感知模块（SPM）通过大尺度可分离核注意力增强形状判别；2）条状感受野模块（SRFM）使用大条状卷积和池化捕捉细长裂缝特征；3）小尺度增强模块（SSEM）利用高分辨率P2特征图、专用检测头和动态上采样改善小目标检测。

Result: 在RDD2022基准测试中，中国子集的F1分数、mAP50和mAP50:95分别比基线提高4.4、2.9和3.4个百分点；完整数据集上达到80.33%的最高F1分数，优于CRDDC'2022参与者和ORDDC'2024第二阶段结果，同时保持有竞争力的推理速度。

Conclusion: StripRFNet实现了最先进的准确性和实时效率，为智能道路维护和可持续基础设施管理提供了有前景的工具。

Abstract: Well-maintained road networks are crucial for achieving Sustainable
Development Goal (SDG) 11. Road surface damage not only threatens traffic
safety but also hinders sustainable urban development. Accurate detection,
however, remains challenging due to the diverse shapes of damages, the
difficulty of capturing slender cracks with high aspect ratios, and the high
error rates in small-scale damage recognition. To address these issues, we
propose StripRFNet, a novel deep neural network comprising three modules: (1) a
Shape Perception Module (SPM) that enhances shape discrimination via large
separable kernel attention (LSKA) in multi-scale feature aggregation; (2) a
Strip Receptive Field Module (SRFM) that employs large strip convolutions and
pooling to capture features of slender cracks; and (3) a Small-Scale
Enhancement Module (SSEM) that leverages a high-resolution P2 feature map, a
dedicated detection head, and dynamic upsampling to improve small-object
detection. Experiments on the RDD2022 benchmark show that StripRFNet surpasses
existing methods. On the Chinese subset, it improves F1-score, mAP50, and
mAP50:95 by 4.4, 2.9, and 3.4 percentage points over the baseline,
respectively. On the full dataset, it achieves the highest F1-score of 80.33%
compared with CRDDC'2022 participants and ORDDC'2024 Phase 2 results, while
maintaining competitive inference speed. These results demonstrate that
StripRFNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time efficiency,
offering a promising tool for intelligent road maintenance and sustainable
infrastructure management.

TL;DR: ObjectTransforms是一种通过对象特定变换来量化和减少基于视觉的目标检测中不确定性的技术，在训练和推理阶段分别提升鲁棒性和量化预测不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶中可靠的感知对安全决策至关重要，但基于视觉的目标检测神经网络容易受到数据偏差和分布偏移等不确定性因素的影响。

Method: 在训练时对单个对象进行色彩空间扰动，并使用扩散模型生成多样化的行人实例；在推理时对检测到的对象应用扰动，利用检测分数的方差实时量化预测不确定性。

Result: 在NuImages 10K数据集上的实验表明，该方法在所有对象类别上都带来了显著的准确率提升和不确定性降低，对假阳性预测了比真阳性更高的不确定性值。

Conclusion: ObjectTransforms作为一种轻量级但有效的机制，在训练和推理阶段分别具有减少和量化基于视觉的感知中不确定性的潜力。

Abstract: Reliable perception is fundamental for safety critical decision making in
autonomous driving. Yet, vision based object detector neural networks remain
vulnerable to uncertainty arising from issues such as data bias and
distributional shifts. In this paper, we introduce ObjectTransforms, a
technique for quantifying and reducing uncertainty in vision based object
detection through object specific transformations at both training and
inference times. At training time, ObjectTransforms perform color space
perturbations on individual objects, improving robustness to lighting and color
variations. ObjectTransforms also uses diffusion models to generate realistic,
diverse pedestrian instances. At inference time, object perturbations are
applied to detected objects and the variance of detection scores are used to
quantify predictive uncertainty in real time. This uncertainty signal is then
used to filter out false positives and also recover false negatives, improving
the overall precision recall curve. Experiments with YOLOv8 on the NuImages 10K
dataset demonstrate that our method yields notable accuracy improvements and
uncertainty reduction across all object classes during training, while
predicting desirably higher uncertainty values for false positives as compared
to true positives during inference. Our results highlight the potential of
ObjectTransforms as a lightweight yet effective mechanism for reducing and
quantifying uncertainty in vision-based perception during training and
inference respectively.

Abstract: Transferring appearance to 3D assets using different representations of the
appearance object - such as images or text - has garnered interest due to its
wide range of applications in industries like gaming, augmented reality, and
digital content creation. However, state-of-the-art methods still fail when the
geometry between the input and appearance objects is significantly different. A
straightforward approach is to directly apply a 3D generative model, but we
show that this ultimately fails to produce appealing results. Instead, we
propose a principled approach inspired by universal guidance. Given a
pretrained rectified flow model conditioned on image or text, our training-free
method interacts with the sampling process by periodically adding guidance.
This guidance can be modeled as a differentiable loss function, and we
experiment with two different types of guidance including part-aware losses for
appearance and self-similarity. Our experiments show that our approach
successfully transfers texture and geometric details to the input 3D asset,
outperforming baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively. We also show
that traditional metrics are not suitable for evaluating the task due to their
inability of focusing on local details and comparing dissimilar inputs, in
absence of ground truth data. We thus evaluate appearance transfer quality with
a GPT-based system objectively ranking outputs, ensuring robust and human-like
assessment, as further confirmed by our user study. Beyond showcased scenarios,
our method is general and could be extended to different types of diffusion
models and guidance functions.

Abstract: Thrombectomy is one of the most effective treatments for ischemic stroke, but
it is resource and personnel-intensive. We propose employing deep learning to
automate critical aspects of thrombectomy, thereby enhancing efficiency and

various skeletal landmarks using a regression-based pretext task. Our
experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms existing methods in both
regression and classification tasks. Notably, our results indicate that the
positional pretext task significantly enhances downstream classification
performance. Future work will focus on extending this framework toward fully

Conclusion: DuetMatch通过异步优化、解耦扰动和一致性匹配等创新设计，有效解决了半监督医学图像分割中的收敛稳定性和噪声鲁棒性问题，在多个基准数据集上取得了优越性能。

Abstract: The limited availability of annotated data in medical imaging makes
semi-supervised learning increasingly appealing for its ability to learn from
imperfect supervision. Recently, teacher-student frameworks have gained
popularity for their training benefits and robust performance. However, jointly
optimizing the entire network can hinder convergence and stability, especially
in challenging scenarios. To address this for medical image segmentation, we
propose DuetMatch, a novel dual-branch semi-supervised framework with
asynchronous optimization, where each branch optimizes either the encoder or
decoder while keeping the other frozen. To improve consistency under noisy
conditions, we introduce Decoupled Dropout Perturbation, enforcing
regularization across branches. We also design Pair-wise CutMix Cross-Guidance
to enhance model diversity by exchanging pseudo-labels through augmented input
pairs. To mitigate confirmation bias from noisy pseudo-labels, we propose
Consistency Matching, refining labels using stable predictions from frozen
teacher models. Extensive experiments on benchmark brain MRI segmentation
datasets, including ISLES2022 and BraTS, show that DuetMatch consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and
robustness across diverse semi-supervised segmentation scenarios.

Conclusion: 该管道有潜力成为安全可靠自主C臂系统的组成部分，能够减少辐射暴露和手术时间。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable C-arm positioning is essential for fluoroscopy-guided
interventions. However, clinical workflows rely on manual alignment that
increases radiation exposure and procedural delays. In this work, we present a
pipeline that autonomously navigates the C-arm to predefined anatomical
landmarks utilizing X-ray images. Given an input X-ray image from an arbitrary
starting location on the operating table, the model predicts a 3D displacement
vector toward each target landmark along the body. To ensure reliable
deployment, we capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in the
model's predictions and further calibrate them using conformal prediction. The
derived prediction regions are interpreted as 3D confidence regions around the
predicted landmark locations. The training framework combines a probabilistic
loss with skeletal pose regularization to encourage anatomically plausible
outputs. We validate our approach on a synthetic X-ray dataset generated from
DeepDRR. Results show not only strong localization accuracy across multiple
architectures but also well-calibrated prediction bounds. These findings
highlight the pipeline's potential as a component in safe and reliable
autonomous C-arm systems. Code is available at

Result: 在背景修复用例中实现了51.61%的显著成本节省

Conclusion: 自动图像质量预过滤可以显著降低获取高质量图像的平均成本，提出的公式为评估IQA引擎的成本效益提供了实用工具

Abstract: Deep generative models have shown impressive progress in recent years, making
it possible to produce high quality images with a simple text prompt or a
reference image. However, state of the art technology does not yet meet the
quality standards offered by traditional photographic methods. For this reason,
production pipelines that use generated images often include a manual stage of
image quality assessment (IQA). This process is slow and expensive, especially
because of the low yield of automatically generated images that pass the
quality bar. The IQA workload can be reduced by introducing an automatic
pre-filtering stage, that will increase the overall quality of the images sent
to review and, therefore, reduce the average cost required to obtain a high
quality image. We present a formula that estimates the cost savings depending
on the precision and pass yield of a generic IQA engine. This formula is
applied in a use case of background inpainting, showcasing a significant cost
saving of 51.61% obtained with a simple AutoML solution.

Abstract: Understanding how the brain encodes visual information is a central challenge
in neuroscience and machine learning. A promising approach is to reconstruct
visual stimuli, essentially images, from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(fMRI) signals. This involves two stages: transforming fMRI signals into a
latent space and then using a pretrained generative model to reconstruct
images. The reconstruction quality depends on how similar the latent space is
to the structure of neural activity and how well the generative model produces
images from that space. Yet, it remains unclear which type of latent space best
supports this transformation and how it should be organized to represent visual
stimuli effectively. We present two key findings. First, fMRI signals are more
similar to the text space of a language model than to either a vision based
space or a joint text image space. Second, text representations and the
generative model should be adapted to capture the compositional nature of
visual stimuli, including objects, their detailed attributes, and
relationships. Building on these insights, we propose PRISM, a model that
Projects fMRI sIgnals into a Structured text space as an interMediate
representation for visual stimuli reconstruction. It includes an object centric
diffusion module that generates images by composing individual objects to
reduce object detection errors, and an attribute relationship search module
that automatically identifies key attributes and relationships that best align
with the neural activity. Extensive experiments on real world datasets
demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods, achieving up to an
8% reduction in perceptual loss. These results highlight the importance of
using structured text as the intermediate space to bridge fMRI signals and
image reconstruction.

Abstract: Mapping agriculture in tropical areas through remote sensing presents unique
challenges, including the lack of high-quality annotated data, the elevated
costs of labeling, data variability, and regional generalisation. This paper
advocates a Data-Centric Artificial Intelligence (DCAI) perspective and
pipeline, emphasizing data quality and curation as key drivers for model
robustness and scalability. It reviews and prioritizes techniques such as
confident learning, core-set selection, data augmentation, and active learning.
The paper highlights the readiness and suitability of 25 distinct strategies in
large-scale agricultural mapping pipelines. The tropical context is of high
interest, since high cloudiness, diverse crop calendars, and limited datasets
limit traditional model-centric approaches. This tutorial outlines practical
solutions as a data-centric approach for curating and training AI models better
suited to the dynamic realities of tropical agriculture. Finally, we propose a
practical pipeline using the 9 most mature and straightforward methods that can
be applied to a large-scale tropical agricultural mapping project.

*Nyle Siddiqui,Rohit Gupta,Sirnam Swetha,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为StretchySnake的灵活训练方法，通过动态调整时空分辨率来增强状态空间模型在视频理解中的适应性，解决了传统方法在未见时空分辨率下的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前针对视频理解的训练方法主要针对transformer设计，未能充分利用状态空间模型的独特优势。传统方法在固定分辨率和视频长度下训练，导致模型在面对训练时未见过的时空分辨率时性能下降，即时空不灵活性。

Method: 提出灵活训练方法，在训练过程中采样不同时空分辨率的视频，并动态插值模型权重以适应任意时空尺度。比较了五种不同的灵活训练变体，确定了最适合视频状态空间模型的策略。

Result: 在短动作（UCF-101、HMDB-51）和长动作（COIN、Breakfast）基准测试中，StretchySnake比transformer和状态空间模型基线性能提升高达28%，在细粒度动作（SSV2、Diving-48）上表现出强大的适应性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个简单的即插即用训练方案，使视频状态空间模型在各种动作识别场景中更加鲁棒、分辨率无关且高效。

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) have emerged as a competitive alternative to
transformers in various tasks. Their linear complexity and hidden-state
recurrence make them particularly attractive for modeling long sequences,
whereas attention becomes quadratically expensive. However, current training
methods for video understanding are tailored towards transformers and fail to
fully leverage the unique attributes of SSMs. For example, video models are
often trained at a fixed resolution and video length to balance the quadratic
scaling of attention cost against performance. Consequently, these models
suffer from degraded performance when evaluated on videos with spatial and
temporal resolutions unseen during training; a property we call spatio-temporal
inflexibility. In the context of action recognition, this severely limits a
model's ability to retain performance across both short- and long-form videos.
Therefore, we propose a flexible training method that leverages and improves
the inherent adaptability of SSMs. Our method samples videos at varying
temporal and spatial resolutions during training and dynamically interpolates
model weights to accommodate any spatio-temporal scale. This instills our SSM,
which we call StretchySnake, with spatio-temporal flexibility and enables it to
seamlessly handle videos ranging from short, fine-grained clips to long,
complex activities. We introduce and compare five different variants of
flexible training, and identify the most effective strategy for video SSMs. On
short-action (UCF-101, HMDB-51) and long-action (COIN, Breakfast) benchmarks,
StretchySnake outperforms transformer and SSM baselines alike by up to 28%,
with strong adaptability to fine-grained actions (SSV2, Diving-48). Therefore,
our method provides a simple drop-in training recipe that makes video SSMs more
robust, resolution-agnostic, and efficient across diverse action recognition
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CNN模型难以捕捉全局面部特征，ViT能建模长距离空间关系但计算复杂度高，需要结合两种模型的优势来解决面部美颜预测的挑战。

Method: 使用异构集成架构，ViT主干捕捉全局面部结构和对称性，Mamba主干以线性复杂度建模长距离依赖关系，关注序列特征和纹理。

Result: 在SCUT-FBP5500数据集上取得PC=0.9212、MAE=0.2085、RMSE=0.2698的SOTA性能，并通过Grad-CAM可视化验证了两主干的互补特征提取。

Conclusion: VM-BeautyNet为计算美学提供了强大的新架构范式，通过融合ViT和Mamba模型的优势，有效解决了面部美颜预测中的全局特征捕捉问题。

Abstract: Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a complex and challenging computer vision
task, aiming to model the subjective and intricate nature of human aesthetic
perception. While deep learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs), have made significant strides, they often struggle to capture
the global, holistic facial features that are critical to human judgment.
Vision Transformers (ViT) address this by effectively modeling long-range
spatial relationships, but their quadratic complexity can be a bottleneck. This
paper introduces a novel, heterogeneous ensemble architecture,
\textbf{VM-BeautyNet}, that synergistically fuses the complementary strengths
of a Vision Transformer and a Mamba-based Vision model, a recent advancement in
State-Space Models (SSMs). The ViT backbone excels at capturing global facial
structure and symmetry, while the Mamba backbone efficiently models long-range
dependencies with linear complexity, focusing on sequential features and
textures. We evaluate our approach on the benchmark SCUT-FBP5500 dataset. Our
proposed VM-BeautyNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a
\textbf{Pearson Correlation (PC) of 0.9212}, a \textbf{Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) of 0.2085}, and a \textbf{Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.2698}.
Furthermore, through Grad-CAM visualizations, we provide interpretability
analysis that confirms the complementary feature extraction of the two
backbones, offering new insights into the model's decision-making process and
presenting a powerful new architectural paradigm for computational aesthetics.

Motivation: 口腔鳞状细胞癌由于早期症状不明显、生长位置隐蔽且生长缓慢，常常难以被及时发现，导致可预防的死亡。利用CNN的精确图像分割技术和模式识别能力可以有效进行早期检测。

Method: 训练了一个包含4293张训练图像的CNN，包括良性和恶性肿瘤以及阴性样本。设计了图像采集和处理硬件系统，测试了5种常见分辨率下的检测准确性。

Result: 随着图像分辨率的提高，预测准确性呈对数增长，显示出更高像素数带来的收益递减效应。设计的增强硬件能够捕获详细图像并提高检测效果。

Conclusion: CNN结合专用图像采集硬件可以有效检测口腔鳞状细胞癌，图像分辨率对检测准确性有重要影响，但存在收益递减现象。

Abstract: Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OCSCC) is the most common type of head
and neck cancer. Due to the subtle nature of its early stages, deep and hidden
areas of development, and slow growth, OCSCC often goes undetected, leading to
preventable deaths. However, properly trained Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs), with their precise image segmentation techniques and ability to apply
kernel matrices to modify the RGB values of images for accurate image pattern
recognition, would be an effective means for early detection of OCSCC. Pairing
this neural network with image capturing and processing hardware would allow
increased efficacy in OCSCC detection. The aim of our project is to develop a
Convolutional Neural Network trained to recognize OCSCC, as well as to design a
physical hardware system to capture and process detailed images, in order to
determine the image quality required for accurate predictions. A CNN was
trained on 4293 training images consisting of benign and malignant tumors, as
well as negative samples, and was evaluated for its precision, recall, and Mean
Average Precision (mAP) in its predictions of OCSCC. A testing dataset of
randomly assorted images of cancerous, non-cancerous, and negative images was
chosen, and each image was altered to represent 5 common resolutions. This test
data set was thoroughly analyzed by the CNN and predictions were scored on the
basis of accuracy. The designed enhancement hardware was used to capture
detailed images, and its impact was scored. An application was developed to
facilitate the testing process and bring open access to the CNN. Images of
increasing resolution resulted in higher-accuracy predictions on a logarithmic
scale, demonstrating the diminishing returns of higher pixel counts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类行为是场景动态的主要来源，包含丰富的动态线索。传统静态物体级重建方法存在固有模糊性，需要利用人类意图性交互来动态优化重建过程。

Method: 采用高斯泼溅技术，通过观察人-物交互在线迭代分解和重建环境，整合相机和物体姿态估计、实例分解、在线地图更新等多个任务。

Result: 在多个真实场景中验证了有效性，实现了准确一致的动态场景建模，具有逼真高效的渲染效果。

Conclusion: 该方法为传统物体级重建方法提供了灵活、渐进的替代方案，能够利用第一人称视角直播中的人-物交互线索进行动态场景建模。

Abstract: Human behaviors are the major causes of scene dynamics and inherently contain
rich cues regarding the dynamics. This paper formalizes a new task of proactive
scene decomposition and reconstruction, an online approach that leverages
human-object interactions to iteratively disassemble and reconstruct the
environment. By observing these intentional interactions, we can dynamically
refine the decomposition and reconstruction process, addressing inherent
ambiguities in static object-level reconstruction. The proposed system
effectively integrates multiple tasks in dynamic environments such as accurate
camera and object pose estimation, instance decomposition, and online map
updating, capitalizing on cues from human-object interactions in egocentric
live streams for a flexible, progressive alternative to conventional
object-level reconstruction methods. Aided by the Gaussian splatting technique,
accurate and consistent dynamic scene modeling is achieved with photorealistic
and efficient rendering. The efficacy is validated in multiple real-world
scenarios with promising advantages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉语言模型的视频异常检测方法虽然具有优异的零样本检测能力，但计算成本巨大且视觉定位性能不稳定，难以实现实时部署。

Method: 采用两级级联系统：离线学习正常行为规则，在线推理时结合轻量级过滤和细粒度VLM推理。关键创新包括运动掩码提示和基于规则的偏差检测。

Result: 在四个数据集上的评估显示，Cerberus在NVIDIA L40S GPU上平均达到57.68 fps，速度提升151.79倍，准确率达到97.2%，与最先进的VLM-based VAD方法相当。

Conclusion: Cerberus为实时视频分析提供了一个实用的解决方案，在保持高精度的同时显著提升了处理速度。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) has rapidly advanced by recent development of
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). While these models offer superior zero-shot
detection capabilities, their immense computational cost and unstable visual
grounding performance hinder real-time deployment. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce Cerberus, a two-stage cascaded system designed for
efficient yet accurate real-time VAD. Cerberus learns normal behavioral rules
offline, and combines lightweight filtering with fine-grained VLM reasoning
during online inference. The performance gains of Cerberus come from two key
innovations: motion mask prompting and rule-based deviation detection. The
former directs the VLM's attention to regions relevant to motion, while the
latter identifies anomalies as deviations from learned norms rather than
enumerating possible anomalies. Extensive evaluations on four datasets show
that Cerberus on average achieves 57.68 fps on an NVIDIA L40S GPU, a
151.79$\times$ speedup, and 97.2\% accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art
VLM-based VAD methods, establishing it as a practical solution for real-time
video analytics.

TL;DR: OpenLVLM-MIA是一个新的基准测试，揭示了评估大型视觉语言模型成员推断攻击时存在的根本性挑战，指出先前研究的高成功率主要源于数据集构建中的分布偏差而非真实的成员状态识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前关于大型视觉语言模型成员推断攻击的研究报告了高成功率，但这些结果可能源于数据集构建过程中的分布偏差，而非真正的成员状态识别能力。需要建立一个无偏的基准测试来准确评估MIA方法的有效性。

Method: 引入一个包含6,000张图像的控制基准测试，其中成员和非成员样本的分布经过仔细平衡，并在三个不同的训练阶段提供真实成员标签，确保评估环境的无偏性。

Result: 在OpenLVLM-MIA基准测试上的实验表明，在无偏条件下，最先进的MIA方法的性能收敛到随机猜测水平，无法有效区分成员和非成员样本。

Conclusion: OpenLVLM-MIA通过提供一个透明且无偏的基准测试，澄清了当前LVLM上MIA研究的局限性，为开发更强的隐私保护技术奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: OpenLVLM-MIA is a new benchmark that highlights fundamental challenges in
evaluating membership inference attacks (MIA) against large vision-language
models (LVLMs). While prior work has reported high attack success rates, our
analysis suggests that these results often arise from detecting distributional
bias introduced during dataset construction rather than from identifying true
membership status. To address this issue, we introduce a controlled benchmark
of 6{,}000 images where the distributions of member and non-member samples are
carefully balanced, and ground-truth membership labels are provided across
three distinct training stages. Experiments using OpenLVLM-MIA demonstrated
that the performance of state-of-the-art MIA methods converged to random chance
under unbiased conditions. By offering a transparent and unbiased benchmark,
OpenLVLM-MIA clarifies the current limitations of MIA research on LVLMs and
provides a solid foundation for developing stronger privacy-preserving
techniques.

Motivation: 生成具有参考风格引导的草图需要精确传输笔画属性（如线条粗细、变形和纹理稀疏度），同时保持语义结构和内容保真度。

Method: 提出跨图像笔画注意力机制，嵌入自注意力层中建立细粒度语义对应关系；开发自适应对比度增强和语义聚焦注意力来强化内容保持和前景强调。

Conclusion: Stroke2Sketch框架能够自适应地整合参考笔画特征到内容图像中，同时保持结构完整性，在笔画属性迁移方面表现出色。

Abstract: Generating sketches guided by reference styles requires precise transfer of
stroke attributes, such as line thickness, deformation, and texture sparsity,
while preserving semantic structure and content fidelity. To this end, we
propose Stroke2Sketch, a novel training-free framework that introduces
cross-image stroke attention, a mechanism embedded within self-attention layers
to establish fine-grained semantic correspondences and enable accurate stroke
attribute transfer. This allows our method to adaptively integrate reference
stroke characteristics into content images while maintaining structural
integrity. Additionally, we develop adaptive contrast enhancement and
semantic-focused attention to reinforce content preservation and foreground
emphasis. Stroke2Sketch effectively synthesizes stylistically faithful sketches
that closely resemble handcrafted results, outperforming existing methods in
expressive stroke control and semantic coherence. Codes are available at

Method: 构建了ScaleDF数据集，包含580万张来自51个不同域的真实图像和880万张由102种深度伪造方法生成的假图像，用于分析模型性能与真实域数量、伪造方法和训练图像数量的关系。

Conclusion: 缩放定律为深度伪造检测提供了数据中心的应对策略，同时研究了预训练和数据增强在缩放中的作用以及缩放本身的局限性。

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study of scaling laws for the deepfake
detection task. Specifically, we analyze the model performance against the
number of real image domains, deepfake generation methods, and training images.
Since no existing dataset meets the scale requirements for this research, we
construct ScaleDF, the largest dataset to date in this field, which contains
over 5.8 million real images from 51 different datasets (domains) and more than
8.8 million fake images generated by 102 deepfake methods. Using ScaleDF, we
observe power-law scaling similar to that shown in large language models
(LLMs). Specifically, the average detection error follows a predictable
power-law decay as either the number of real domains or the number of deepfake
methods increases. This key observation not only allows us to forecast the
number of additional real domains or deepfake methods required to reach a
target performance, but also inspires us to counter the evolving deepfake
technology in a data-centric manner. Beyond this, we examine the role of
pre-training and data augmentations in deepfake detection under scaling, as
well as the limitations of scaling itself.

TL;DR: Scale-DiT是一个新的扩散框架，通过分层局部注意力和低分辨率全局引导，实现了超高清图像的高效生成，能在不依赖4K训练数据的情况下达到4K分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型受限于注意力机制的二次复杂性和缺乏原生4K训练数据，无法生成超高清图像。需要一种既能保持全局语义连贯性又能合成精细纹理的方法。

Method: 采用分层局部注意力机制，将高分辨率潜在空间划分为固定大小的局部窗口来降低计算复杂度，同时使用低分辨率潜在空间注入全局语义。通过LoRA适配器连接全局和局部路径，并采用Hilbert曲线重排和融合内核优化推理效率。

Result: Scale-DiT相比密集注意力基线实现了2倍以上的推理速度提升和更低的内存使用，可靠地扩展到4K分辨率，在定量指标（FID、IS、CLIP Score）和定性比较中都表现出优越的全局连贯性和更清晰的局部细节。

Conclusion: 分层局部注意力配合引导性低分辨率锚点是一种推进超高清图像生成的有效方法，能够在不需要额外高分辨率训练数据的情况下实现高质量的4K图像生成。

Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution text-to-image generation demands both fine-grained
texture synthesis and globally coherent structure, yet current diffusion models
remain constrained to sub-$1K \times 1K$ resolutions due to the prohibitive
quadratic complexity of attention and the scarcity of native $4K$ training
data. We present \textbf{Scale-DiT}, a new diffusion framework that introduces
hierarchical local attention with low-resolution global guidance, enabling
efficient, scalable, and semantically coherent image synthesis at ultra-high
resolutions. Specifically, high-resolution latents are divided into fixed-size
local windows to reduce attention complexity from quadratic to near-linear,
while a low-resolution latent equipped with scaled positional anchors injects
global semantics. A lightweight LoRA adaptation bridges global and local
pathways during denoising, ensuring consistency across structure and detail. To
maximize inference efficiency, we repermute token sequence in Hilbert curve
order and implement a fused-kernel for skipping masked operations, resulting in
a GPU-friendly design. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Scale-DiT
achieves more than $2\times$ faster inference and lower memory usage compared
to dense attention baselines, while reliably scaling to $4K \times 4K$
resolution without requiring additional high-resolution training data. On both
quantitative benchmarks (FID, IS, CLIP Score) and qualitative comparisons,
Scale-DiT delivers superior global coherence and sharper local detail, matching
or outperforming state-of-the-art methods that rely on native 4K training.
Taken together, these results highlight hierarchical local attention with
guided low-resolution anchors as a promising and effective approach for
advancing ultra-high-resolution image generation.

Conclusion: DiffusionX在最小开销下展示了效率和可扩展性，有效解决了扩散模型生成延迟和资源消耗问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have driven remarkable progress in image
generation. However, the generation process remains computationally intensive,
and users often need to iteratively refine prompts to achieve the desired
results, further increasing latency and placing a heavy burden on cloud
resources. To address this challenge, we propose DiffusionX, a cloud-edge
collaborative framework for efficient multi-round, prompt-based generation. In
this system, a lightweight on-device diffusion model interacts with users by
rapidly producing preview images, while a high-capacity cloud model performs
final refinements after the prompt is finalized. We further introduce a noise
level predictor that dynamically balances the computation load, optimizing the
trade-off between latency and cloud workload. Experiments show that DiffusionX
reduces average generation time by 15.8% compared with Stable Diffusion v1.5,
while maintaining comparable image quality. Moreover, it is only 0.9% slower
than Tiny-SD with significantly improved image quality, thereby demonstrating
efficiency and scalability with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: TokenAR框架有效解决了多参考图像生成中的身份混淆问题，通过token级增强机制实现了高质量、高多样性的多主体生成。

Abstract: Autoregressive Model (AR) has shown remarkable success in conditional image
generation. However, these approaches for multiple reference generation
struggle with decoupling different reference identities. In this work, we
propose the TokenAR framework, specifically focused on a simple but effective
token-level enhancement mechanism to address reference identity confusion
problem. Such token-level enhancement consists of three parts, 1). Token Index
Embedding clusters the tokens index for better representing the same reference
images; 2). Instruct Token Injection plays as a role of extra visual feature
container to inject detailed and complementary priors for reference tokens; 3).
The identity-token disentanglement strategy (ITD) explicitly guides the token
representations toward independently representing the features of each
identity.This token-enhancement framework significantly augments the
capabilities of existing AR based methods in conditional image generation,
enabling good identity consistency while preserving high quality background
reconstruction. Driven by the goal of high-quality and high-diversity in

### [133] [RL makes MLLMs see better than SFT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16333)
*Junha Song,Sangdoo Yun,Dongyoon Han,Jaegul Choo,Byeongho Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现强化学习(RL)比监督微调(SFT)在多模态语言模型的视觉编码器训练中产生更强、更精确的视觉表示，提出了PIVOT方法，能以不到1%的计算成本实现更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态语言模型研究中普遍假设性能主要继承自LLM骨干网络，忽视了视觉编码器的作用，特别是在从SFT转向RL训练范式后，缺乏对视觉编码器如何被重塑的分析。

Method: 通过ImageNet分类、分割和梯度可视化等多样实验分析不同训练策略对视觉编码器的影响，提出了Preference-Instructed Vision Optimization (PIVOT)方法。

Result: RL训练产生更强且精确定位的视觉表示，PIVOT训练的视觉编码器优于更大规模训练的对应模型，计算成本不到标准视觉预训练的1%。

Conclusion: RL训练范式能有效重塑多模态语言模型的视觉表示能力，PIVOT方法为推进MLLM视觉骨干提供了高效路径。

Abstract: A dominant assumption in Multimodal Language Model (MLLM) research is that
its performance is largely inherited from the LLM backbone, given its immense
parameter scale and remarkable capabilities. This has created a void in the
understanding of the vision encoder, which determines how MLLMs perceive
images. The recent shift in MLLM training paradigms, from Supervised Finetuning
(SFT) to Reinforcement Learning (RL), magnifies this oversight-namely, the
significant lack of analysis on how such training reshapes the vision encoder
as well as the MLLM. To address this, we first investigate the impact of
training strategies on MLLMs, where RL shows a clear advantage over SFT in
strongly vision-related VQA benchmarks. Motivated by this, we conduct a
critical yet under-explored analysis of the vision encoder of MLLMs through
diverse and in-depth experiments, ranging from ImageNet classification and
segmentation to gradient visualization. Our results demonstrate that MLLM's
post-training strategy (i.e., SFT or RL) not only leads to distinct outcomes on
MLLM downstream tasks, but also fundamentally reshapes MLLM's underlying visual
representations. Specifically, the key finding of our study is that RL produces
stronger and precisely localized visual representations compared to SFT,
boosting the ability of the vision encoder for MLLM. We then reframe our
findings into a simple recipe for building strong vision encoders for MLLMs,
Preference-Instructed Vision OpTimization (PIVOT). When integrated into MLLMs,
a PIVOT-trained vision encoder outperforms even larger and more heavily-trained
counterparts, despite requiring less than 1% of the computational cost of
standard vision pretraining. This result opens an effective and efficient path
for advancing the vision backbones of MLLMs. Project page available at

*Bo Peng,Jie Lu,Guangquan Zhang,Zhen Fang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了GradNorm框架，通过梯度大小衡量名词与图像语义的接近程度，用于语言辅助图像聚类中的正名词筛选，理论上有严格误差界限且包含现有方法为特例，实验表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言辅助图像聚类中如何从未标注语料中筛选与目标图像语义相近的正名词的问题，现有基于CLIP特征空间的方法缺乏理论基础。

Method: 提出基于梯度的GradNorm框架，通过预测目标分布与softmax输出之间的交叉熵反向传播梯度大小来衡量名词的语义接近程度。

Result: 理论证明GradNorm具有严格的误差界限，能将现有过滤策略作为自身特例，实验在各种基准测试中达到最先进的聚类性能。

Conclusion: GradNorm为语言辅助图像聚类提供了理论严谨且性能优越的正名词筛选方法，统一了现有策略并显著提升了聚类效果。

Abstract: This paper investigates the recently emerged problem of Language-assisted
Image Clustering (LaIC), where textual semantics are leveraged to improve the
discriminability of visual representations to facilitate image clustering. Due
to the unavailability of true class names, one of core challenges of LaIC lies
in how to filter positive nouns, i.e., those semantically close to the images
of interest, from unlabeled wild corpus data. Existing filtering strategies are
predominantly based on the off-the-shelf feature space learned by CLIP;
however, despite being intuitive, these strategies lack a rigorous theoretical
foundation. To fill this gap, we propose a novel gradient-based framework,
termed as GradNorm, which is theoretically guaranteed and shows strong
empirical performance. In particular, we measure the positiveness of each noun
based on the magnitude of gradients back-propagated from the cross-entropy
between the predicted target distribution and the softmax output.
Theoretically, we provide a rigorous error bound to quantify the separability
of positive nouns by GradNorm and prove that GradNorm naturally subsumes
existing filtering strategies as extremely special cases of itself.
Empirically, extensive experiments show that GradNorm achieves the
state-of-the-art clustering performance on various benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交制造模式下的质量控制和缺陷检测面临三大挑战：产品高度定制化、生产碎片化小批量、分布式站点成像环境差异大，需要解决真实数据集和定制算法的稀缺问题。

Method: 构建MIRAD数据集，捕捉社交制造领域的三个关键维度：多样化定制产品的大类内变异、六个地理分散制造节点的数据收集、显著的成像异质性（光照、背景、运动条件变化）。

Result: 对最先进的异常检测方法（单类、多类和零样本方法）进行广泛评估，结果显示与传统基准相比，所有模型性能显著下降，突显了现实世界个性化生产中缺陷检测的未解决复杂性。

Conclusion: MIRAD通过连接工业需求和学术研究，为开发工业5.0所需的稳健质量控制解决方案提供了现实基础，数据集已公开可用。

Abstract: Social manufacturing leverages community collaboration and scattered
resources to realize mass individualization in modern industry. However, this
paradigm shift also introduces substantial challenges in quality control,
particularly in defect detection. The main difficulties stem from three
aspects. First, products often have highly customized configurations. Second,
production typically involves fragmented, small-batch orders. Third, imaging
environments vary considerably across distributed sites. To overcome the
scarcity of real-world datasets and tailored algorithms, we introduce the Mass
Individualization Robust Anomaly Detection (MIRAD) dataset. As the first
benchmark explicitly designed for anomaly detection in social manufacturing,
MIRAD captures three critical dimensions of this domain: (1) diverse
individualized products with large intra-class variation, (2) data collected
from six geographically dispersed manufacturing nodes, and (3) substantial
imaging heterogeneity, including variations in lighting, background, and motion
conditions. We then conduct extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
anomaly detection methods on MIRAD, covering one-class, multi-class, and
zero-shot approaches. Results show a significant performance drop across all
models compared with conventional benchmarks, highlighting the unresolved
complexities of defect detection in real-world individualized production. By
bridging industrial requirements and academic research, MIRAD provides a
realistic foundation for developing robust quality control solutions essential
for Industry 5.0. The dataset is publicly available at

Abstract: The development of computer-assisted surgery systems depends on large-scale,
annotated datasets. Current resources for cataract surgery often lack the
diversity and annotation depth needed to train generalizable deep-learning
models. To address this gap, we present a dataset of 3,000 phacoemulsification
cataract surgery videos from two surgical centers, performed by surgeons with a
range of experience levels. This resource is enriched with four annotation
layers: temporal surgical phases, instance segmentation of instruments and
anatomical structures, instrument-tissue interaction tracking, and quantitative
skill scores based on the established competency rubrics like the ICO-OSCAR.
The technical quality of the dataset is supported by a series of benchmarking
experiments for key surgical AI tasks, including workflow recognition, scene
segmentation, and automated skill assessment. Furthermore, we establish a
domain adaptation baseline for the phase recognition task by training a model
on a subset of surgical centers and evaluating its performance on a held-out
center. The dataset and annotations are available in Google Form

dashcam frames capturing diverse Indian road conditions, weather patterns, and
lighting scenarios, which we used to fine-tune the Ultralytics YOLO model for
accurate pothole detection. The system synchronizes OCR-extracted video
timestamps with external GPS logs to precisely geolocate each detected pothole,
enriching detections with comprehensive metadata, including road segment
attribution and contractor information managed through an optimized backend
database. iWatchRoadv2 introduces intelligent governance features that enable
authorities to link road segments with contract metadata through a secure login

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前虽然存在强大的人类和动物3D参数化模型，但缺乏同样表达力的植物建模方法。

Method: 开发了Demeter参数化模型，编码植物形态的关键因素，处理不同物种的拓扑变化，并建模关节、子组件形状变化和非刚性变形三种形状变化来源。

Result: 在大规模大豆农场数据集上测试，Demeter能有效合成形状、重建结构和模拟生物物理过程。

Conclusion: Demeter为植物建模提供了表达力强的参数化方法，在作物植物建模方面具有应用价值。

Abstract: Learning 3D parametric shape models of objects has gained popularity in
vision and graphics and has showed broad utility in 3D reconstruction,
generation, understanding, and simulation. While powerful models exist for
humans and animals, equally expressive approaches for modeling plants are
lacking. In this work, we present Demeter, a data-driven parametric model that
encodes key factors of a plant morphology, including topology, shape,
articulation, and deformation into a compact learned representation. Unlike
previous parametric models, Demeter handles varying shape topology across
various species and models three sources of shape variation: articulation,
subcomponent shape variation, and non-rigid deformation. To advance crop plant
modeling, we collected a large-scale, ground-truthed dataset from a soybean
farm as a testbed. Experiments show that Demeter effectively synthesizes
shapes, reconstructs structures, and simulates biophysical processes. Code and

TL;DR: 提出了一种面向AR/VR边缘设备的轻量级深度学习框架，采用编码器-解码器架构，通过稀疏卷积、SPLite解码器和量化感知训练，在Raspberry Pi 5上实现2.98倍加速，同时保持与先进方法相当的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AR/VR设备的普及，边缘设备需要实时推理、低功耗和低延迟，但现有框架难以平衡效率与性能。

Method: 基于ResNet-18骨干网络应用稀疏卷积，提出SPLite解码器架构，并采用量化感知训练来优化性能。

Result: 端到端效率提升42%，解码帧率在Raspberry Pi 5上提升3.1倍，内存使用减少，精度损失极小（PA-MPJPE从9.0mm仅增至9.1mm）。

Conclusion: 该框架在保持精度的同时显著提升了计算效率，适用于AR/VR边缘设备的实时深度学习应用。

Abstract: With the increasing ubiquity of AR/VR devices, the deployment of deep
learning models on edge devices has become a critical challenge. These devices
require real-time inference, low power consumption, and minimal latency. Many
framework designers face the conundrum of balancing efficiency and performance.
We design a light framework that adopts an encoder-decoder architecture and
introduces several key contributions aimed at improving both efficiency and
accuracy. We apply sparse convolution on a ResNet-18 backbone to exploit the
inherent sparsity in hand pose images, achieving a 42% end-to-end efficiency
improvement. Moreover, we propose our SPLite decoder. This new architecture
significantly boosts the decoding process's frame rate by 3.1x on the Raspberry
Pi 5, while maintaining accuracy on par. To further optimize performance, we
apply quantization-aware training, reducing memory usage while preserving
accuracy (PA-MPJPE increases only marginally from 9.0 mm to 9.1 mm on
FreiHAND). Overall, our system achieves a 2.98x speed-up on a Raspberry Pi 5
CPU (BCM2712 quad-core Arm A76 processor). Our method is also evaluated on
compound benchmark datasets, demonstrating comparable accuracy to
state-of-the-art approaches while significantly enhancing computational

Conclusion: REALM框架在3D对象分割和交互任务中展现出卓越性能和实用性，为复杂指令驱动的3D场景理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Bridging the gap between complex human instructions and precise 3D object
grounding remains a significant challenge in vision and robotics. Existing 3D
segmentation methods often struggle to interpret ambiguous, reasoning-based
instructions, while 2D vision-language models that excel at such reasoning lack
intrinsic 3D spatial understanding. In this paper, we introduce REALM, an
innovative MLLM-agent framework that enables open-world reasoning-based
segmentation without requiring extensive 3D-specific post-training. We perform
segmentation directly on 3D Gaussian Splatting representations, capitalizing on
their ability to render photorealistic novel views that are highly suitable for
MLLM comprehension. As directly feeding one or more rendered views to the MLLM
can lead to high sensitivity to viewpoint selection, we propose a novel
Global-to-Local Spatial Grounding strategy. Specifically, multiple global views
are first fed into the MLLM agent in parallel for coarse-level localization,
aggregating responses to robustly identify the target object. Then, several
close-up novel views of the object are synthesized to perform fine-grained
local segmentation, yielding accurate and consistent 3D masks. Extensive
experiments show that REALM achieves remarkable performance in interpreting
both explicit and implicit instructions across LERF, 3D-OVS, and our newly
introduced REALM3D benchmarks. Furthermore, our agent framework seamlessly
supports a range of 3D interaction tasks, including object removal,
replacement, and style transfer, demonstrating its practical utility and
versatility. Project page: https://ChangyueShi.github.io/REALM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在视觉中心任务中过度依赖语言先验，在推理过程中使用文本捷径，缺乏对视觉证据的充分利用。传统强化学习方法因缺乏可扩展和可靠的奖励机制而难以应用于VLMs。

Method: 将自监督学习目标（如图像旋转预测、掩码补丁重建）重新构建为密集、自动的奖励信号，无需人工偏好数据或不可靠的AI评估器。

Result: SSL4RL显著提升了在视觉中心和视觉语言推理基准测试上的性能，并通过系统消融实验确定了任务难度、模型规模和语义对齐等关键因素。

Conclusion: SSL4RL建立了一个通用有效的范式，使用可验证的自监督目标来对齐多模态模型，并在图学习领域也展示了良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable abilities by integrating
large language models with visual inputs. However, they often fail to utilize
visual evidence adequately, either depending on linguistic priors in
vision-centric tasks or resorting to textual shortcuts during reasoning.
Although reinforcement learning (RL) can align models with desired behaviors,
its application to VLMs has been hindered by the lack of scalable and reliable
reward mechanisms. To overcome this challenge, we propose SSL4RL, a novel
framework that leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) tasks as a source of
verifiable rewards for RL-based fine-tuning. Our approach reformulates SSL
objectives-such as predicting image rotation or reconstructing masked
patches-into dense, automatic reward signals, eliminating the need for human
preference data or unreliable AI evaluators. Experiments show that SSL4RL
substantially improves performance on both vision-centric and vision-language
reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, through systematic ablations, we identify
key factors-such as task difficulty, model scale, and semantic alignment with
the target domain-that influence the effectiveness of SSL4RL tasks, offering
new design principles for future work. We also demonstrate the framework's
generality by applying it to graph learning, where it yields significant gains.
SSL4RL establishes a versatile and effective paradigm for aligning multimodal
models using verifiable, self-supervised objectives.

Motivation: 传统方法将点和线匹配视为独立任务，而GlueStick虽然能同时处理点和线，但其复杂的GNN架构阻碍了实时应用和边缘设备部署。

Method: 提出注意力线消息传递机制，显式暴露线段连通性，实现节点间高效通信，构建轻量级匹配网络架构。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到新的最先进性能，同时显著降低计算复杂度。

Conclusion: LightGlueStick通过高效的注意力线消息传递机制，在保持高匹配精度的同时实现了轻量化，适用于实时应用和边缘设备部署。

Abstract: Lines and points are complementary local features, whose combination has
proven effective for applications such as SLAM and Structure-from-Motion. The
backbone of these pipelines are the local feature matchers, establishing
correspondences across images. Traditionally, point and line matching have been
treated as independent tasks. Recently, GlueStick proposed a GNN-based network
that simultaneously operates on points and lines to establish matches. While
running a single joint matching reduced the overall computational complexity,
the heavy architecture prevented real-time applications or deployment to edge
devices.
  Inspired by recent progress in point matching, we propose LightGlueStick, a
lightweight matcher for points and line segments. The key novel component in
our architecture is the Attentional Line Message Passing (ALMP), which
explicitly exposes the connectivity of the lines to the network, allowing for
efficient communication between nodes. In thorough experiments we show that
LightGlueStick establishes a new state-of-the-art across different benchmarks.

Abstract: The rapid development of deepfake video technology has not only facilitated
artistic creation but also made it easier to spread misinformation. Traditional
deepfake video detection (DVD) methods face issues such as a lack of
transparency in their principles and insufficient generalization capabilities
to cope with evolving forgery techniques. This highlights an urgent need for
detectors that can identify forged content and provide verifiable reasoning
explanations. This paper proposes the explainable deepfake video detection
(EDVD) task and designs the EDVD-LLaMA multimodal, a large language model
(MLLM) reasoning framework, which provides traceable reasoning processes
alongside accurate detection results and trustworthy explanations. Our approach
first incorporates a Spatio-Temporal Subtle Information Tokenization (ST-SIT)
to extract and fuse global and local cross-frame deepfake features, providing
rich spatio-temporal semantic information input for MLLM reasoning. Second, we
construct a Fine-grained Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (Fg-MCoT) mechanism, which
introduces facial feature data as hard constraints during the reasoning process
to achieve pixel-level spatio-temporal video localization, suppress
hallucinated outputs, and enhance the reliability of the chain of thought. In
addition, we build an Explainable Reasoning FF++ benchmark dataset
(ER-FF++set), leveraging structured data to annotate videos and ensure quality
control, thereby supporting dual supervision for reasoning and detection.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDVD-LLaMA achieves outstanding
performance and robustness in terms of detection accuracy, explainability, and
its ability to handle cross-forgery methods and cross-dataset scenarios.
Compared to previous DVD methods, it provides a more explainable and superior
solution. The source code and dataset will be publicly available.

Abstract: Referring Atomic Video Action Recognition (RAVAR) aims to recognize
fine-grained, atomic-level actions of a specific person of interest conditioned
on natural language descriptions. Distinct from conventional action recognition
and detection tasks, RAVAR emphasizes precise language-guided action
understanding, which is particularly critical for interactive human action
analysis in complex multi-person scenarios. In this work, we extend our
previously introduced RefAVA dataset to RefAVA++, which comprises >2.9 million
frames and >75.1k annotated persons in total. We benchmark this dataset using
baselines from multiple related domains, including atomic action localization,
video question answering, and text-video retrieval, as well as our earlier
model, RefAtomNet. Although RefAtomNet surpasses other baselines by
incorporating agent attention to highlight salient features, its ability to
align and retrieve cross-modal information remains limited, leading to
suboptimal performance in localizing the target person and predicting
fine-grained actions. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, we introduce
RefAtomNet++, a novel framework that advances cross-modal token aggregation
through a multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned cross-attention mechanism
combined with multi-trajectory Mamba modeling at the partial-keyword,
scene-attribute, and holistic-sentence levels. In particular, scanning
trajectories are constructed by dynamically selecting the nearest visual
spatial tokens at each timestep for both partial-keyword and scene-attribute
levels. Moreover, we design a multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned
cross-attention strategy, enabling more effective aggregation of spatial and
temporal tokens across different semantic hierarchies. Experiments show that
RefAtomNet++ establishes new state-of-the-art results. The dataset and code are

Abstract: Detecting rotated objects accurately and efficiently is a significant
challenge in computer vision, particularly in applications such as aerial
imagery, remote sensing, and autonomous driving. Although traditional object
detection frameworks are effective for axis-aligned objects, they often
underperform in scenarios involving rotated objects due to their limitations in
capturing orientation variations. This paper introduces an improved loss
function aimed at enhancing detection accuracy and robustness by leveraging the
Gaussian bounding box representation and Bhattacharyya distance. In addition,
we advocate for the use of an anisotropic Gaussian representation to address
the issues associated with isotropic variance in square-like objects. Our
proposed method addresses these challenges by incorporating a
rotation-invariant loss function that effectively captures the geometric
properties of rotated objects. We integrate this proposed loss function into
state-of-the-art deep learning-based rotated object detection detectors, and
extensive experiments demonstrated significant improvements in mean Average
Precision metrics compared to existing methods. The results highlight the
potential of our approach to establish new benchmark in rotated object
detection, with implications for a wide range of applications requiring precise
and reliable object localization irrespective of orientation.

### [146] [VIPAMIN: Visual Prompt Initialization via Embedding Selection and Subspace Expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16446)
*Jaekyun Park,Hye Won Chung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VIPAMIN是一种视觉提示初始化策略，通过将提示与嵌入空间中的语义信息区域对齐，并注入超出预训练子空间的新表示方向，来增强自监督模型的适应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模基础模型时代，完全微调预训练网络对每个下游任务来说资源消耗巨大。现有的视觉提示调优方法在应用于自监督骨干网络时，往往无法专门化提示或丰富表示空间，这在具有挑战性的任务和数据稀缺设置中尤为明显。

Method: VIPAMIN通过两个关键步骤增强自监督模型的适应：(1)将提示与嵌入空间中的语义信息区域对齐；(2)注入超出预训练子空间的新表示方向。该方法仅需单次前向传播和轻量级操作。

Result: VIPAMIN在各种任务和数据集大小上持续提升性能，在视觉提示调优领域达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: VIPAMIN提供了一种简单而有效的视觉提示初始化策略，能够显著增强自监督模型在下游任务中的适应能力，特别是在具有挑战性和数据稀缺的环境中。

Abstract: In the era of large-scale foundation models, fully fine-tuning pretrained
networks for each downstream task is often prohibitively resource-intensive.
Prompt tuning offers a lightweight alternative by introducing tunable prompts
while keeping the backbone frozen. However, existing visual prompt tuning
methods often fail to specialize the prompts or enrich the representation
space--especially when applied to self-supervised backbones. We show that these
limitations become especially pronounced in challenging tasks and data-scarce
settings, where effective adaptation is most critical. In this work, we
introduce VIPAMIN, a visual prompt initialization strategy that enhances
adaptation of self-supervised models by (1) aligning prompts with semantically
informative regions in the embedding space, and (2) injecting novel
representational directions beyond the pretrained subspace. Despite its
simplicity--requiring only a single forward pass and lightweight
operations--VIPAMIN consistently improves performance across diverse tasks and
dataset sizes, setting a new state of the art in visual prompt tuning. Our code
is available at https://github.com/iamjaekyun/vipamin.

*Shan Xiong,Jiabao Chen,Ye Wang,Jialin Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种弱监督域自适应方法，利用稀疏点标注实现线粒体分割，通过多任务学习框架结合分割和中心检测任务，显著提升了跨域分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决电子显微镜图像中线粒体分割的标注成本高问题，传统无监督域自适应方法在实际应用中性能较低，需要更有效的弱监督方法。

Method: 多任务学习框架，联合进行分割和中心检测，采用交叉教学机制和类聚焦跨域对比学习，并引入基于实例感知的伪标签选择策略。

Result: 在多个挑战性数据集上的验证表明，该方法优于现有的无监督和弱监督域自适应方法，显著缩小了与全监督方法的性能差距。

Conclusion: 该方法通过有效利用稀疏点标注和伪标签选择策略，在线粒体分割任务中实现了优异的跨域适应性能。

Abstract: Annotation-efficient segmentation of the numerous mitochondria instances from
various electron microscopy (EM) images is highly valuable for biological and
neuroscience research. Although unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods
can help mitigate domain shifts and reduce the high costs of annotating each
domain, they typically have relatively low performance in practical
applications. Thus, we investigate weakly supervised domain adaptation (WDA)
that utilizes additional sparse point labels on the target domain, which
require minimal annotation effort and minimal expert knowledge. To take full
use of the incomplete and imprecise point annotations, we introduce a multitask
learning framework that jointly conducts segmentation and center detection with
a novel cross-teaching mechanism and class-focused cross-domain contrastive
learning. While leveraging unlabeled image regions is essential, we introduce
segmentation self-training with a novel instance-aware pseudo-label (IPL)
selection strategy. Unlike existing methods that typically rely on pixel-wise
pseudo-label filtering, the IPL semantically selects reliable and diverse
pseudo-labels with the help of the detection task. Comprehensive validations
and comparisons on challenging datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing UDA and WDA methods, significantly narrowing the performance gap with
the supervised upper bound. Furthermore, under the UDA setting, our method also
achieves substantial improvements over other UDA techniques.

### [148] [NavQ: Learning a Q-Model for Foresighted Vision-and-Language Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16457)
*Peiran Xu,Xicheng Gong,Yadong MU*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种面向目标的视觉语言导航方法，通过Q学习训练Q模型来学习室内场景布局和物体关系，生成描述潜在未来信息的Q特征，结合导航指令进行前瞻性决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要基于历史信息做决策，忽略了行动的长期影响和未来结果，需要开发具有前瞻性的智能体。

Method: 使用大规模无标签轨迹数据训练Q模型学习场景知识，生成Q特征描述行动后的潜在未来信息，通过跨模态未来编码器结合导航指令生成反映未来前景的行动分数，与基于历史的原始分数结合实现A*式搜索策略。

Result: 在广泛使用的目标导向VLN数据集上进行了大量实验，验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合历史信息和未来预测，实现了更有效的目标导向视觉语言导航。

Abstract: In this work we concentrate on the task of goal-oriented Vision-and-Language
Navigation (VLN). Existing methods often make decisions based on historical
information, overlooking the future implications and long-term outcomes of the
actions. In contrast, we aim to develop a foresighted agent. Specifically, we
draw upon Q-learning to train a Q-model using large-scale unlabeled trajectory
data, in order to learn the general knowledge regarding the layout and object
relations within indoor scenes. This model can generate a Q-feature, analogous
to the Q-value in traditional Q-network, for each candidate action, which
describes the potential future information that may be observed after taking
the specific action. Subsequently, a cross-modal future encoder integrates the
task-agnostic Q-feature with navigation instructions to produce a set of action
scores reflecting future prospects. These scores, when combined with the
original scores based on history, facilitate an A*-style searching strategy to
effectively explore the regions that are more likely to lead to the
destination. Extensive experiments conducted on widely used goal-oriented VLN
datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### [149] [HGC-Avatar: Hierarchical Gaussian Compression for Streamable Dynamic 3D Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16463)
*Haocheng Tang,Ruoke Yan,Xinhui Yin,Qi Zhang,Xinfeng Zhang,Siwei Ma,Wen Gao,Chuanmin Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HGC-Avatar是一个用于动态3D虚拟人高效传输和高质量渲染的分层高斯压缩框架，通过结构层和运动层分离表示，支持分层压缩和渐进解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于3D高斯泼溅的压缩方法缺乏人体先验知识，导致比特率效率和重建质量不佳，限制了其在可流式3D虚拟人系统中的应用。

Method: 将高斯表示解耦为结构层（通过StyleUNet生成器将姿态映射到高斯）和运动层（利用SMPL-X模型紧凑表示时序姿态变化），并引入面部注意力机制。

Result: 实验结果显示HGC-Avatar在视觉质量和压缩效率方面显著优于现有方法，提供了可流式的快速3D虚拟人渲染解决方案。

Conclusion: HGC-Avatar通过分层设计和人体先验知识，成功解决了动态3D虚拟人传输中的压缩效率和渲染质量问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled fast,
photorealistic rendering of dynamic 3D scenes, showing strong potential in
immersive communication. However, in digital human encoding and transmission,
the compression methods based on general 3DGS representations are limited by
the lack of human priors, resulting in suboptimal bitrate efficiency and
reconstruction quality at the decoder side, which hinders their application in
streamable 3D avatar systems. We propose HGC-Avatar, a novel Hierarchical
Gaussian Compression framework designed for efficient transmission and
high-quality rendering of dynamic avatars. Our method disentangles the Gaussian
representation into a structural layer, which maps poses to Gaussians via a
StyleUNet-based generator, and a motion layer, which leverages the SMPL-X model
to represent temporal pose variations compactly and semantically. This
hierarchical design supports layer-wise compression, progressive decoding, and
controllable rendering from diverse pose inputs such as video sequences or
text. Since people are most concerned with facial realism, we incorporate a
facial attention mechanism during StyleUNet training to preserve identity and
expression details under low-bitrate constraints. Experimental results
demonstrate that HGC-Avatar provides a streamable solution for rapid 3D avatar
rendering, while significantly outperforming prior methods in both visual
quality and compression efficiency.

### [150] [PRISMM-Bench: A Benchmark of Peer-Review Grounded Multimodal Inconsistencies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16505)
*Lukas Selch,Yufang Hou,M. Jehanzeb Mirza,Sivan Doveh,James Glass,Rogerio Feris,Wei Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISMM-Bench是首个基于真实审稿人标记的科学论文不一致性的多模态基准，包含262个不一致案例，评估模型在识别、纠正和跨模态推理方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准忽视了科学论文中跨文本、图表、方程的多模态不一致性问题，这些问题影响科学研究的清晰度、可重复性和可信度。

Method: 通过多阶段流程（审稿挖掘、LLM辅助过滤、人工验证）构建基准，设计三个任务（不一致识别、纠正、配对匹配），并引入结构化JSON答案表示以减少语言偏见。

Result: 对21个领先LMM的评估显示性能极低（26.1-54.2%），包括大型开源模型和专有模型。

Conclusion: 多模态科学推理具有挑战性，需要开发更可靠的科学助手。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly applied to scientific
research, yet it remains unclear whether they can reliably understand and
reason over the multimodal complexity of papers. A central challenge lies in
detecting and resolving inconsistencies across text, figures, tables, and
equations, issues that are often subtle, domain-specific, and ultimately
undermine clarity, reproducibility, and trust. Existing benchmarks overlook
this issue, either isolating single modalities or relying on synthetic errors
that fail to capture real-world complexity. We introduce PRISMM-Bench
(Peer-Review-sourced Inconsistency Set for Multimodal Models), the first
benchmark grounded in real reviewer-flagged inconsistencies in scientific
papers. Through a multi-stage pipeline of review mining, LLM-assisted filtering
and human verification, we curate 262 inconsistencies from 242 papers. Based on
this set, we design three tasks, namely inconsistency identification, remedy
and pair matching, which assess a model's capacity to detect, correct, and
reason over inconsistencies across different modalities. Furthermore, to
address the notorious problem of choice-only shortcuts in multiple-choice
evaluation, where models exploit answer patterns without truly understanding
the question, we further introduce structured JSON-based answer representations
that minimize linguistic biases by reducing reliance on superficial stylistic
cues. We benchmark 21 leading LMMs, including large open-weight models
(GLM-4.5V 106B, InternVL3 78B) and proprietary models (Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5
with high reasoning). Results reveal strikingly low performance (26.1-54.2%),
underscoring the challenge of multimodal scientific reasoning and motivating
progress towards trustworthy scientific assistants.

### [151] [OOS-DSD: Improving Out-of-stock Detection in Retail Images using Auxiliary Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16508)
*Franko Šikić,Sven Lončarić*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出OOS-DSD方法，通过辅助学习改进缺货检测，在YOLOv8基础上增加产品分割和深度估计分支，性能优于现有方法1.8% mAP。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺货检测是零售验证的重要过程，需要准确推断货架上产品的不可用性。现有方法仍有改进空间。

Method: 扩展YOLOv8架构，增加卷积分支同时进行缺货检测、产品分割和深度估计。深度分支使用Depth Anything V2的伪标签训练，并提出了深度归一化方法。

Result: 实验结果显示该方法比现有最优方法性能提升1.8% mAP。消融研究证实辅助学习提升3.7% mAP，深度归一化提升4.2% mAP。

Conclusion: OOS-DSD通过多任务辅助学习和深度归一化有效提升了缺货检测性能，证明了辅助学习在零售视觉任务中的价值。

Abstract: Out-of-stock (OOS) detection is a very important retail verification process
that aims to infer the unavailability of products in their designated areas on
the shelf. In this paper, we introduce OOS-DSD, a novel deep learning-based
method that advances OOS detection through auxiliary learning. In particular,
we extend a well-established YOLOv8 object detection architecture with
additional convolutional branches to simultaneously detect OOS, segment
products, and estimate scene depth. While OOS detection and product
segmentation branches are trained using ground truth data, the depth estimation
branch is trained using pseudo-labeled annotations produced by the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) depth estimation model Depth Anything V2. Furthermore,
since the aforementioned pseudo-labeled depth estimates display relative depth,
we propose an appropriate depth normalization procedure that stabilizes the
training process. The experimental results show that the proposed method
surpassed the performance of the SOTA OOS detection methods by 1.8% of the mean
average precision (mAP). In addition, ablation studies confirm the
effectiveness of auxiliary learning and the proposed depth normalization
procedure, with the former increasing mAP by 3.7% and the latter by 4.2%.

*Duygu Sap,Martin Lotz,Connor Mattinson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图注意力网络自编码器的图像分类和检索方法，通过构建图像和类别的代表性模型来进行分类和检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种基于代表性模型的图像分类和检索方法，利用图结构捕捉图像间的相似性关系，通过注意力机制突出重要特征。

Method: 使用图结构表示图像及其相似关系，应用图注意力网络自编码器构建上下文感知的潜在表示，从中提取类别代表，通过比较查询图像代表与类别代表进行分类，并在所属类别中检索最相似图像。

Result: 通过实验验证了该代表性中心方法的有效性，比较了图注意力网络自编码器与标准基于特征的技术。

Conclusion: 提出的代表性中心方法在图像分类和检索任务中表现有效，图注意力网络能够构建捕捉关键特征的上下文感知表示。

Abstract: We propose a method for image categorization and retrieval that leverages
graphs and a graph attention network (GAT)-based autoencoder. Our approach is
representative-centric, that is, we execute the categorization and retrieval
process via the representative models we construct for the images and image
categories. We utilize a graph where nodes represent images (or their
representatives) and edges capture similarity relationships. GAT highlights
important features and relationships between images, enabling the autoencoder
to construct context-aware latent representations that capture the key features
of each image relative to its neighbors. We obtain category representatives
from these embeddings and categorize a query image by comparing its
representative to the category representatives. We then retrieve the most
similar image to the query image within its identified category. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our representative-centric approach through experiments
with both the GAT autoencoders and standard feature-based techniques.

*Jihoon Kwon,Kyle Min,Jy-yong Sohn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: READ是一种微调方法，通过添加token级重建和句子级对齐两个辅助目标来增强视觉语言模型的组合推理能力，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准对比训练的目标函数使文本编码器倾向于关注单个单词而非其关系，导致组合推理能力不足。

Method: READ方法在对比学习基础上添加两个辅助目标：(1) token级重建目标：使用冻结预训练解码器基于原始标题嵌入重建替代标题；(2) 句子级对齐目标：在嵌入空间中显式对齐同义句。

Result: READ-CLIP在五个主要组合推理基准测试中达到最先进性能，比最强传统微调基线提升高达4.1%。应用于现有CLIP变体也能提升性能。

Conclusion: 重建和对齐目标提供互补优势：重建鼓励编码器捕捉标题内单词间关系，对齐确保不同表达方式的同义句具有一致表示。

Abstract: Despite recent advances, vision-language models trained with standard
contrastive objectives still struggle with compositional reasoning -- the
ability to understand structured relationships between visual and linguistic
elements. This shortcoming is largely due to the tendency of the text encoder
to focus on individual words rather than their relations, a limitation
reinforced by contrastive training that primarily aligns words with visual
objects. In this paper, we introduce REconstruction and Alignment of text
Descriptions (READ), a fine-tuning method designed to enhance compositional
reasoning by adding two auxiliary objectives to the contrastive learning: (1) a
token-level reconstruction objective, where a frozen pre-trained decoder
reconstructs alternative captions based on the embedding of the original
caption; and (2) a sentence-level alignment objective, which explicitly aligns
paraphrased sentences in the embedding space. We show that READ-CLIP, a model
derived by applying the READ method to the pre-trained CLIP model, achieves the
state-of-the-art performance across five major compositional reasoning
benchmarks, outperforming the strongest conventional fine-tuning baseline by up
to 4.1%. Furthermore, applying the READ to existing CLIP variants (including
NegCLIP and FSC-CLIP) also improves performance on these benchmarks.
Quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that our proposed objectives --
reconstruction and alignment -- offer complementary benefits: the former
encourages the encoder to capture relationships between words within a caption,
while the latter ensures consistent representations for paraphrases expressed
with different wording.

*Binyuan Huang,Yongdong Luo,Xianda Guo,Xiawu Zheng,Zheng Zhu,Jiahui Pan,Chengju Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GaitRDAE框架，通过动态搜索运动区域并分配自适应时间尺度来改进步态识别，解决了现有方法使用固定时间尺度难以建模动态变化运动区域的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有步态识别方法使用预定义区域和固定时间尺度进行时序建模，难以处理随时间动态变化的运动区域，也无法适应不同区域的特定模式。

Method: 提出区域感知动态聚合与激励框架(GaitRDAE)，包含两个核心模块：RDA模块动态搜索每个区域的最佳时间感受野，RDE模块强调学习包含稳定行为模式的运动区域，抑制对易受协变量影响的静态区域的关注。

Result: 实验结果表明，GaitRDAE在多个基准数据集上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: GaitRDAE通过动态区域搜索和自适应时间尺度分配，有效提升了步态识别的准确性，特别是在处理动态变化运动区域方面表现出色。

Abstract: Deep learning-based gait recognition has achieved great success in various
applications. The key to accurate gait recognition lies in considering the
unique and diverse behavior patterns in different motion regions, especially
when covariates affect visual appearance. However, existing methods typically
use predefined regions for temporal modeling, with fixed or equivalent temporal
scales assigned to different types of regions, which makes it difficult to
model motion regions that change dynamically over time and adapt to their
specific patterns. To tackle this problem, we introduce a Region-aware Dynamic
Aggregation and Excitation framework (GaitRDAE) that automatically searches for
motion regions, assigns adaptive temporal scales and applies corresponding
attention. Specifically, the framework includes two core modules: the
Region-aware Dynamic Aggregation (RDA) module, which dynamically searches the
optimal temporal receptive field for each region, and the Region-aware Dynamic
Excitation (RDE) module, which emphasizes the learning of motion regions
containing more stable behavior patterns while suppressing attention to static
regions that are more susceptible to covariates. Experimental results show that
GaitRDAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets.

*Guangyu Lin,Li Lin,Christina P. Walker,Daniel S. Schiff,Shu Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个基于真实世界政治深度伪造事件的系统基准，评估了现有检测器在真实政治深度伪造内容上的表现，发现现有检测器普遍泛化能力不足，需要开发更具政治背景的检测框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成内容的快速扩散增加了虚假信息风险，特别是政治深度伪造会破坏真相和削弱对政治机构的信任。现有检测模型大多在实验室合成数据集上训练，难以泛化到社交媒体上传播的真实政治深度伪造内容。

Method: 基于政治深度伪造事件数据库构建系统基准，对学术界、政府和工业界的最先进深度伪造检测器进行系统性评估。

Result: 学术界和政府开发的检测器表现相对较差，付费检测工具性能相对较高，但所有评估的检测器都难以有效泛化到真实政治深度伪造内容，且容易受到简单操作的影响，特别是在视频领域。

Conclusion: 需要开发具有政治背景的深度伪造检测框架，以在真实世界环境中更好地保护公众。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of AI-generated content, driven by advances in
generative adversarial networks, diffusion models, and multimodal large
language models, has made the creation and dissemination of synthetic media
effortless, heightening the risks of misinformation, particularly political
deepfakes that distort truth and undermine trust in political institutions. In
turn, governments, research institutions, and industry have strongly promoted
deepfake detection initiatives as solutions. Yet, most existing models are
trained and validated on synthetic, laboratory-controlled datasets, limiting
their generalizability to the kinds of real-world political deepfakes
circulating on social platforms that affect the public. In this work, we
introduce the first systematic benchmark based on the Political Deepfakes
Incident Database, a curated collection of real-world political deepfakes
shared on social media since 2018. Our study includes a systematic evaluation
of state-of-the-art deepfake detectors across academia, government, and
industry. We find that the detectors from academia and government perform
relatively poorly. While paid detection tools achieve relatively higher
performance than free-access models, all evaluated detectors struggle to
generalize effectively to authentic political deepfakes, and are vulnerable to
simple manipulations, especially in the video domain. Results urge the need for
politically contextualized deepfake detection frameworks to better safeguard
the public in real-world settings.

TL;DR: SHIELD是一个无需训练的方法，通过重新加权视觉token、引入噪声token和应用对抗攻击来缓解大型视觉语言模型中的物体幻觉问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型存在物体幻觉问题，即生成看似合理但不准确的物体描述。与之前关注LLM组件的研究不同，本文首次将幻觉问题追溯到视觉编码器，并识别出三个关键问题：统计偏差、固有偏差和脆弱性

Method: 提出SHIELD框架，包含三种策略：1) 重新加权视觉token以减少统计偏差；2) 引入噪声衍生token来对抗固有偏差；3) 应用对抗攻击结合对比解码来解决脆弱性

Result: 实验表明SHIELD能有效缓解多种基准测试和LVLM家族中的物体幻觉问题，同时在通用LVLM基准上表现优异

Conclusion: SHIELD是一个无需训练且广泛适用的框架，能有效解决LVLM中的物体幻觉问题，通过直接针对视觉编码器的偏差和脆弱性来实现改进

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel in diverse cross-modal tasks.
However, object hallucination, where models produce plausible but inaccurate
object descriptions, remains a significant challenge. In contrast to previous
work focusing on LLM components, this paper is the first to trace LVLM
hallucinations to visual encoders and identifies three key issues: statistical
bias, inherent bias, and vulnerability. To address these challenges, we propose
SHIELD, a training-free framework that mitigates hallucinations through three
strategies: re-weighting visual tokens to reduce statistical bias, introducing
noise-derived tokens to counter inherent bias, and applying adversarial attacks
with contrastive decoding to address vulnerability. Experiments demonstrate
that SHIELD effectively mitigates object hallucinations across diverse
benchmarks and LVLM families. Moreover, SHIELD achieves strong performance on
the general LVLM benchmark, highlighting its broad applicability. Code will be
released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisionSelector是一个轻量级的即插即用框架，通过可学习的决策过程解决MLLMs中视觉令牌压缩问题，使用可微分Top-K机制和课程退火策略，在保持性能的同时显著提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理高分辨率图像或多图像输入时面临大量视觉令牌带来的计算和内存瓶颈，现有压缩技术受限于启发式规则，可能丢失关键信息或存在注意力偏差。

Method: 提出VisionSelector框架，包含与MLLM主干解耦的评分器模块，采用可微分Top-K机制和课程退火策略，实现端到端的令牌选择过程。

Result: 仅需12.85M可训练参数，在MME基准上保持100%准确率（30%保留预算），在10%保留预算下比之前方法提升12.14%，预填充速度翻倍。

Conclusion: VisionSelector提供了一种高效且自适应的令牌压缩解决方案，在各种压缩率下都能保持优越性能，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encounter significant computational
and memory bottlenecks from the massive number of visual tokens generated by
high-resolution images or multi-image inputs. Previous token compression
techniques are often constrained by heuristic rules that risk discarding
critical information. They may suffer from biases, such as attention sinks,
that lead to sharp performance drops under aggressive compression ratios. To
address these limitations, we reformulate token compression as a lightweight
plug-and-play framework that reformulates token compression into an end-to-end
learnable decision process. To be specific, we propose VisionSelector, a scorer
module decoupled from the MLLM backbone that incorporates a differentiable
Top-K mechanism and a curriculum annealing strategy to bridge the
training-inference gap, enabling efficient and adaptive token selection various
arbitrary compression rates. Remarkably lightweight with only 12.85M trainable
parameters, VisionSelector demonstrates generalization across various
compression rates and adaptively identifying critical tokens. This leads to
superior performance across all compression budgets, evidenced by preserving
100% accuracy on MME with 30% retention budget, outperforming prior methods by
12.14% at 10% retention budget, and doubling prefill speed. Our code is
available at https://github.com/JulietChoo/VisionSelector .

Abstract: Medical imaging plays a vital role in modern diagnostics; however,
interpreting high-resolution radiological data remains time-consuming and
susceptible to variability among clinicians. Traditional image processing
techniques often lack the precision, robustness, and speed required for
real-time clinical use. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a
deep learning framework for real-time medical image analysis designed to
enhance diagnostic accuracy and computational efficiency across multiple
imaging modalities, including X-ray, CT, and MRI. The proposed system
integrates advanced neural network architectures such as U-Net, EfficientNet,
and Transformer-based models with real-time optimization strategies including
model pruning, quantization, and GPU acceleration. The framework enables
flexible deployment on edge devices, local servers, and cloud infrastructures,
ensuring seamless interoperability with clinical systems such as PACS and EHR.
Experimental evaluations on public benchmark datasets demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, achieving classification accuracies above 92%,
segmentation Dice scores exceeding 91%, and inference times below 80
milliseconds. Furthermore, visual explanation tools such as Grad-CAM and
segmentation overlays enhance transparency and clinical interpretability. These
results indicate that the proposed framework can substantially accelerate
diagnostic workflows, reduce clinician workload, and support trustworthy AI
integration in time-critical healthcare environments.

Abstract: This paper presents a vision-only autonomous flight system for small UAVs
operating in controlled indoor environments. The system combines semantic
segmentation with monocular depth estimation to enable obstacle avoidance,
scene exploration, and autonomous safe landing operations without requiring GPS
or expensive sensors such as LiDAR. A key innovation is an adaptive scale
factor algorithm that converts non-metric monocular depth predictions into
accurate metric distance measurements by leveraging semantic ground plane
detection and camera intrinsic parameters, achieving a mean distance error of
14.4 cm. The approach uses a knowledge distillation framework where a
color-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) teacher generates training data for a
lightweight U-Net student network (1.6M parameters) capable of real-time
semantic segmentation. For more complex environments, the SVM teacher can be
replaced with a state-of-the-art segmentation model. Testing was conducted in a
controlled 5x4 meter laboratory environment with eight cardboard obstacles
simulating urban structures. Extensive validation across 30 flight tests in a
real-world environment and 100 flight tests in a digital-twin environment
demonstrates that the combined segmentation and depth approach increases the
distance traveled during surveillance and reduces mission time while
maintaining 100% success rates. The system is further optimized through
end-to-end learning, where a compact student neural network learns complete
flight policies from demonstration data generated by our best-performing
method, achieving an 87.5% autonomous mission success rate. This work advances
practical vision-based drone navigation in structured environments,
demonstrating solutions for metric depth estimation and computational
efficiency challenges that enable deployment on resource-constrained platforms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiVerse是一个新颖的多轮对话基准测试，包含647个对话，涵盖12个流行VLM评估基准的484个任务，使用GPT-4o作为自动评估器，评估18个VLMs在37个关键方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多轮对话数据集仅部分捕捉用户遇到的各种对话场景，而真实应用需要更复杂的多轮对话能力。

Method: 从12个VLM评估基准中提取647个对话，每个对话平均4轮，提出基于检查表的评估方法，使用GPT-4o作为自动评估器。

Result: 即使最强的模型（如GPT-4o）在复杂多轮对话中也仅达到50%的成功率，提供完整对话上下文显著提升较小或较弱模型的性能。

Conclusion: MultiVerse是评估VLM多轮交互能力的基准，强调了上下文学习的重要性，揭示了当前模型在多轮对话中的局限性。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Models (VLMs) have shown impressive capabilities on
single-turn benchmarks, yet real-world applications often demand more intricate
multi-turn dialogues. Existing multi-turn datasets (e.g, MMDU, ConvBench) only
partially capture the breadth and depth of conversational scenarios encountered
by users. In this work, we introduce MultiVerse, a novel multi-turn
conversation benchmark featuring 647 dialogues - each averaging four turns -
derived from a diverse set of 12 popular VLM evaluation benchmarks. With 484
tasks and 484 interaction goals, MultiVerse covers a wide range of topics, from
factual knowledge and perception to advanced reasoning tasks such as
mathematics and coding. To facilitate robust assessment, we propose a
checklist-based evaluation method that leverages GPT-4o as the automated
evaluator, measuring performance across 37 key aspects, including perceptual
accuracy, linguistic clarity, and factual correctness. We evaluate 18 VLMs on
MultiVerse, revealing that even the strongest models (e.g., GPT-4o) achieve
only a 50% success rate in complex multi-turn conversations, highlighting the
dataset's challenging nature. Notably, we find that providing full dialogue
context significantly enhances performance for smaller or weaker models,
emphasizing the importance of in-context learning. We believe MultiVerse is a
landscape of evaluating multi-turn interaction abilities for VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出使用检索增强生成方法，通过图数据库和Cypher查询语言接口，让LLM能够高效检索3D场景图中的相关信息，解决大规模场景图的语言接地问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将3D场景图序列化为文本放入LLM上下文窗口，但这种方法无法扩展到大型或丰富的3D场景图，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用检索增强生成，将3D场景图编码到图数据库中，为LLM提供Cypher查询语言作为工具接口，使其能够检索与任务相关的数据。

Result: 在指令跟随和场景问答任务中，相比基线方法，使用Cypher接口的方法在大规模场景图上扩展性更好，性能显著提升，同时大幅减少场景图内容的token数量。

Conclusion: Cypher作为3D场景图的接口，能够显著提升语言接地任务的性能，同时有效减少计算资源消耗，适用于本地和云端模型。

Abstract: In order to provide a robot with the ability to understand and react to a
user's natural language inputs, the natural language must be connected to the
robot's underlying representations of the world. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) and 3D scene graphs (3DSGs) have become a popular choice for
grounding natural language and representing the world. In this work, we address
the challenge of using LLMs with 3DSGs to ground natural language. Existing
methods encode the scene graph as serialized text within the LLM's context
window, but this encoding does not scale to large or rich 3DSGs. Instead, we
propose to use a form of Retrieval Augmented Generation to select a subset of
the 3DSG relevant to the task. We encode a 3DSG in a graph database and provide
a query language interface (Cypher) as a tool to the LLM with which it can
retrieve relevant data for language grounding. We evaluate our approach on
instruction following and scene question-answering tasks and compare against
baseline context window and code generation methods. Our results show that
using Cypher as an interface to 3D scene graphs scales significantly better to
large, rich graphs on both local and cloud-based models. This leads to large
performance improvements in grounded language tasks while also substantially
reducing the token count of the scene graph content. A video supplement is

TL;DR: 提出了针对病理学基础模型的通用可迁移对抗扰动(UTAP)，这是一种固定的弱噪声模式，能系统性地破坏多个病理学基础模型的特征表示能力，导致下游任务性能显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示病理学基础模型的关键脆弱性，为模型鲁棒性评估建立高标准基准，推动防御机制发展，确保AI在病理学中的安全可靠部署。

Method: 使用深度学习优化生成固定的弱噪声模式(UTAP)，该扰动具有通用性和可迁移性，能够跨不同视野和数据集应用，并能成功攻击未见过的黑盒病理学基础模型。

Result: UTAP在各种最先进的病理学基础模型和多个数据集上进行了系统评估，通过视觉不可察觉的固定噪声模式显著降低了模型性能。

Conclusion: UTAP构成了对各种新兴病理学基础模型及其应用的广泛威胁，强调了推进防御机制的必要性，并为对抗训练提供了必要资源。

Abstract: We introduce Universal and Transferable Adversarial Perturbations (UTAP) for
pathology foundation models that reveal critical vulnerabilities in their
capabilities. Optimized using deep learning, UTAP comprises a fixed and weak
noise pattern that, when added to a pathology image, systematically disrupts
the feature representation capabilities of multiple pathology foundation
models. Therefore, UTAP induces performance drops in downstream tasks that
utilize foundation models, including misclassification across a wide range of
unseen data distributions. In addition to compromising the model performance,
we demonstrate two key features of UTAP: (1) universality: its perturbation can
be applied across diverse field-of-views independent of the dataset that UTAP
was developed on, and (2) transferability: its perturbation can successfully
degrade the performance of various external, black-box pathology foundation
models - never seen before. These two features indicate that UTAP is not a
dedicated attack associated with a specific foundation model or image dataset,
but rather constitutes a broad threat to various emerging pathology foundation
models and their applications. We systematically evaluated UTAP across various
state-of-the-art pathology foundation models on multiple datasets, causing a
significant drop in their performance with visually imperceptible modifications
to the input images using a fixed noise pattern. The development of these
potent attacks establishes a critical, high-standard benchmark for model
robustness evaluation, highlighting a need for advancing defense mechanisms and
potentially providing the necessary assets for adversarial training to ensure
the safe and reliable deployment of AI in pathology.

Conclusion: HYDRA方法成功克服了先前光谱重建模型的关键限制，为高光谱图像应用提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral images (HSI) promise to support a range of new applications in
computer vision. Recent research has explored the feasibility of generalizable
Spectral Reconstruction (SR), the problem of recovering a HSI from a natural
three-channel color image in unseen scenarios.
  However, previous Multi-Scale Attention (MSA) works have only demonstrated
sufficient generalizable results for very sparse spectra, while modern HSI
sensors contain hundreds of channels.
  This paper introduces a novel approach to spectral reconstruction via our
HYbrid knowledge Distillation and spectral Reconstruction Architecture (HYDRA).
  Using a Teacher model that encapsulates latent hyperspectral image data and a
Student model that learns mappings from natural images to the Teacher's encoded
domain, alongside a novel training method, we achieve high-quality spectral
reconstruction.
  This addresses key limitations of prior SR models, providing SOTA performance
across all metrics, including an 18\% boost in accuracy, and faster inference
times than current SOTA models at various channel depths.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在空间推理中的两个基本瓶颈：基于2D预训练导致的3D理解能力不足，以及冗余3D信息引发的推理失败。

Method: 采用双智能体框架：感知智能体使用感知工具箱程序化查询3D场景提取充分信息，包括新颖的SOG模块提取语言接地方向；推理智能体迭代精炼信息追求最小化，在闭环中修剪冗余细节并请求缺失信息，直到构建出最小充分集。

Result: 在多个挑战性基准测试中显著提高了准确性，达到了最先进的性能水平，并产生了可解释的推理路径。

Conclusion: 通过明确追求充分性和最小化，该方法有效解决了空间推理问题，为未来模型提供了高质量的训练数据来源。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning, the ability to ground language in 3D understanding,
remains a persistent challenge for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We identify
two fundamental bottlenecks: inadequate 3D understanding capabilities stemming
from 2D-centric pre-training, and reasoning failures induced by redundant 3D
information. To address these, we first construct a Minimal Sufficient Set
(MSS) of information before answering a given question: a compact selection of
3D perception results from \textit{expert models}. We introduce MSSR (Minimal
Sufficient Spatial Reasoner), a dual-agent framework that implements this
principle. A Perception Agent programmatically queries 3D scenes using a
versatile perception toolbox to extract sufficient information, including a
novel SOG (Situated Orientation Grounding) module that robustly extracts
language-grounded directions. A Reasoning Agent then iteratively refines this
information to pursue minimality, pruning redundant details and requesting
missing ones in a closed loop until the MSS is curated. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method, by explicitly pursuing both sufficiency and
minimality, significantly improves accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art
performance across two challenging benchmarks. Furthermore, our framework
produces interpretable reasoning paths, offering a promising source of
high-quality training data for future models. Source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OCT成像中固有的散斑噪声和临床环境限制使得获取配对的干净-噪声图像数据集非常困难，需要开发仅使用噪声图像的自监督去噪方法

Method: SDPA++框架：首先通过自融合和自监督去噪生成伪真实图像，然后使用基于块的策略训练集成去噪模型

Result: 在IEEE SPS VIP Cup真实世界数据集上验证，通过CNR、MSR、TP和EP等指标显示性能提升，该数据集仅包含噪声OCT图像而无干净参考

Conclusion: 该方法在缺乏干净参考图像的情况下有效提升OCT图像质量，具有改善临床诊断结果的潜力

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a widely used non-invasive imaging
technique that provides detailed three-dimensional views of the retina, which
are essential for the early and accurate diagnosis of ocular diseases.
Consequently, OCT image analysis and processing have emerged as key research
areas in biomedical imaging. However, acquiring paired datasets of clean and
real-world noisy OCT images for supervised denoising models remains a
formidable challenge due to intrinsic speckle noise and practical constraints
in clinical imaging environments. To address these issues, we propose SDPA++: A
General Framework for Self-Supervised Denoising with Patch Aggregation. Our
novel approach leverages only noisy OCT images by first generating
pseudo-ground-truth images through self-fusion and self-supervised denoising.
These refined images then serve as targets to train an ensemble of denoising
models using a patch-based strategy that effectively enhances image clarity.
Performance improvements are validated via metrics such as Contrast-to-Noise
Ratio (CNR), Mean Square Ratio (MSR), Texture Preservation (TP), and Edge
Preservation (EP) on the real-world dataset from the IEEE SPS Video and Image
Processing Cup. Notably, the VIP Cup dataset contains only real-world noisy OCT
images without clean references, highlighting our method's potential for
improving image quality and diagnostic outcomes in clinical practice.

Method: 提出DCCL方法：数据层面使用更激进的数据增强和跨领域正样本提升类内连通性；模型层面提出模型锚定技术利用预训练表示的类内连通性，并结合生成变换损失。

Result: 在五个标准领域泛化基准测试上的实验表明，DCCL即使在没有领域监督的情况下也优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: DCCL通过增强跨领域的概念连通性，能够获得可泛化的表示，有效解决领域泛化问题。

Abstract: Distribution shifts between training and testing samples frequently occur in
practice and impede model generalization performance. This crucial challenge
thereby motivates studies on domain generalization (DG), which aim to predict
the label on unseen target domain data by solely using data from source
domains. It is intuitive to conceive the class-separated representations
learned in contrastive learning (CL) are able to improve DG, while the reality
is quite the opposite: users observe directly applying CL deteriorates the
performance. We analyze the phenomenon with the insights from CL theory and
discover lack of intra-class connectivity in the DG setting causes the
deficiency. We thus propose a new paradigm, domain-connecting contrastive
learning (DCCL), to enhance the conceptual connectivity across domains and
obtain generalizable representations for DG. On the data side, more aggressive
data augmentation and cross-domain positive samples are introduced to improve
intra-class connectivity. On the model side, to better embed the unseen test
domains, we propose model anchoring to exploit the intra-class connectivity in
pre-trained representations and complement the anchoring with generative
transformation loss. Extensive experiments on five standard DG benchmarks are
performed. The results verify that DCCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
even without domain supervision. The detailed model implementation and the code
are provided through https://github.com/weitianxin/DCCL

Method: 采用一致性模型学习噪声和干净运动状态之间的自一致映射，使用基于Transformer的时空架构配合时间嵌入来建模长程依赖关系并保持运动连贯性。

Result: 在Human3.6M和HumanEva-I数据集上的实验表明，HumanCM在达到与最先进扩散模型相当或更优的准确性的同时，将推理步骤减少了高达两个数量级。

Conclusion: HumanCM证明了通过一致性模型实现高效单步运动预测的可行性，为实时人体运动预测应用提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: We present HumanCM, a one-step human motion prediction framework built upon
consistency models. Instead of relying on multi-step denoising as in
diffusion-based methods, HumanCM performs efficient single-step generation by
learning a self-consistent mapping between noisy and clean motion states. The
framework adopts a Transformer-based spatiotemporal architecture with temporal
embeddings to model long-range dependencies and preserve motion coherence.
Experiments on Human3.6M and HumanEva-I demonstrate that HumanCM achieves
comparable or superior accuracy to state-of-the-art diffusion models while
reducing inference steps by up to two orders of magnitude.

Abstract: Existing research on 3D Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggles to
achieve grounded question-answering, primarily due to the under-exploration of
the mech- anism of human-like scene-object grounded reasoning. This paper
bridges the gap by presenting a novel framework. We first introduce a grounded
Chain-of- Thought reasoning method in 3D scenes (SCENECOT), decoupling a
complex reasoning task into simpler and manageable problems, and building
corresponding visual clues based on multimodal expert modules. To enable such a
method, we develop SCENECOT-185K, the first large-scale grounded CoT reasoning
dataset, consisting of 185K high-quality instances. Extensive experiments
across various complex 3D scene reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our new
framework achieves strong performance with high grounding-QA coherence. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first successful application of CoT
reasoning to 3D scene understanding, enabling step-by-step human-like reasoning
and showing potential for extension to broader 3D scene understanding
scenarios.

TL;DR: IR-WM是一种隐式残差世界模型，专注于建模世界的当前状态和演化，通过仅预测基于自车动作和场景上下文的"残差"变化，避免冗余建模静态背景，显著提升4D占用预测和轨迹规划性能。

Motivation: 当前端到端自动驾驶系统中的视觉中心世界模型存在效率问题，它们完全重建未来场景，将大量计算能力浪费在冗余建模静态背景上。

Method: IR-WM首先从视觉观测建立当前状态的鲁棒鸟瞰图表示，然后利用前一时刻的BEV特征作为强时序先验，仅预测基于自车动作和场景上下文的残差变化。还应用对齐模块校准语义和动态错位，并研究不同的预测-规划耦合方案。

Result: 在nuScenes基准测试中，IR-WM在4D占用预测和轨迹规划方面均达到顶级性能。

Conclusion: 隐式残差世界模型通过专注于动态变化而非完全重建，显著提升了自动驾驶系统的效率和准确性，世界模型生成的隐式未来状态能大幅改善规划精度。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems increasingly rely on vision-centric
world models to understand and predict their environment. However, a common
ineffectiveness in these models is the full reconstruction of future scenes,
which expends significant capacity on redundantly modeling static backgrounds.
To address this, we propose IR-WM, an Implicit Residual World Model that
focuses on modeling the current state and evolution of the world. IR-WM first
establishes a robust bird's-eye-view representation of the current state from
the visual observation. It then leverages the BEV features from the previous
timestep as a strong temporal prior and predicts only the "residual", i.e., the
changes conditioned on the ego-vehicle's actions and scene context. To
alleviate error accumulation over time, we further apply an alignment module to
calibrate semantic and dynamic misalignments. Moreover, we investigate
different forecasting-planning coupling schemes and demonstrate that the
implicit future state generated by world models substantially improves planning
accuracy. On the nuScenes benchmark, IR-WM achieves top performance in both 4D
occupancy forecasting and trajectory planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球珊瑚礁产品如Allen Coral Atlas在空间精度和语义一致性方面存在局限，特别是在需要精细边界划分的区域，需要解决这些挑战以实现有效的珊瑚礁保护。

Method: 基于UKAN架构，UKANFormer在解码器中引入了全局-局部变换器（GL-Trans）块，能够同时提取全局语义结构和局部边界细节。

Result: UKANFormer在珊瑚类IoU达到67.00%，像素精度达到83.98%，在相同噪声标签设置下优于传统基线方法，产生的预测在视觉和结构上都比训练使用的噪声标签更准确。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明数据质量并不直接限制模型性能，架构设计可以缓解标签噪声，支持在非完美监督下进行可扩展映射，为生态监测提供了基础框架。

Abstract: Coral reefs are vital yet fragile ecosystems that require accurate
large-scale mapping for effective conservation. Although global products such
as the Allen Coral Atlas provide unprecedented coverage of global coral reef
distri-bution, their predictions are frequently limited in spatial precision
and semantic consistency, especially in regions requiring fine-grained boundary
delineation. To address these challenges, we propose UKANFormer, a novel
se-mantic segmentation model designed to achieve high-precision mapping under
noisy supervision derived from Allen Coral Atlas. Building upon the UKAN
architecture, UKANFormer incorporates a Global-Local Transformer (GL-Trans)
block in the decoder, enabling the extraction of both global semantic
structures and local boundary details. In experiments, UKANFormer achieved a
coral-class IoU of 67.00% and pixel accuracy of 83.98%, outperforming
conventional baselines under the same noisy labels setting. Remarkably, the
model produces predictions that are visually and structurally more accurate
than the noisy labels used for training. These results challenge the notion
that data quality directly limits model performance, showing that architectural
design can mitigate label noise and sup-port scalable mapping under imperfect
supervision. UKANFormer provides a foundation for ecological monitoring where
reliable labels are scarce.

Abstract: Embodied AI requires agents that perceive, act, and anticipate how actions
reshape future world states. World models serve as internal simulators that
capture environment dynamics, enabling forward and counterfactual rollouts to
support perception, prediction, and decision making. This survey presents a
unified framework for world models in embodied AI. Specifically, we formalize
the problem setting and learning objectives, and propose a three-axis taxonomy
encompassing: (1) Functionality, Decision-Coupled vs. General-Purpose; (2)
Temporal Modeling, Sequential Simulation and Inference vs. Global Difference
Prediction; (3) Spatial Representation, Global Latent Vector, Token Feature

systematize data resources and metrics across robotics, autonomous driving, and
general video settings, covering pixel prediction quality, state-level
understanding, and task performance. Furthermore, we offer a quantitative
comparison of state-of-the-art models and distill key open challenges,
including the scarcity of unified datasets and the need for evaluation metrics

### [172] [Visual Autoregressive Models Beat Diffusion Models on Inference Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16751)
*Erik Riise,Mehmet Onurcan Kaya,Dim P. Papadopoulos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究表明，离散的自回归视觉模型比连续扩散模型更适合推理时搜索优化，束搜索能显著提升文本到图像生成质量，2B参数的自回归模型可超越12B参数的扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然推理时搜索在大型语言模型中取得了革命性进展，但在图像生成领域应用搜索策略效果有限，简单随机采样往往表现最佳。研究旨在探索搜索策略在视觉生成中的有效应用。

Method: 采用离散的自回归视觉模型，利用束搜索进行推理时优化，通过早期剪枝和计算重用提升效率，并进行系统消融实验验证离散标记空间的优势。

Result: 束搜索显著改善文本到图像生成，2B参数自回归模型在多个基准测试中超越12B参数扩散模型，验证器分析揭示了速度与推理能力之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 模型架构（而非仅规模）对视觉生成中的推理时优化至关重要，离散自回归模型为搜索策略提供了更有效的平台。

Abstract: While inference-time scaling through search has revolutionized Large Language
Models, translating these gains to image generation has proven difficult.
Recent attempts to apply search strategies to continuous diffusion models show
limited benefits, with simple random sampling often performing best. We
demonstrate that the discrete, sequential nature of visual autoregressive
models enables effective search for image generation. We show that beam search
substantially improves text-to-image generation, enabling a 2B parameter
autoregressive model to outperform a 12B parameter diffusion model across
benchmarks. Systematic ablations show that this advantage comes from the
discrete token space, which allows early pruning and computational reuse, and
our verifier analysis highlights trade-offs between speed and reasoning
capability. These findings suggest that model architecture, not just scale, is
critical for inference-time optimization in visual generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个包含1302个SR伪影示例的数据集，每个伪影都有众包显著性评分，并训练了一个轻量级回归器来生成空间显著性热图，优于现有方法检测显著伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式图像超分辨率模型容量的扩大，它们产生伪影的趋势也在增加，这些伪影会降低感知质量。关键的是，它们的感知影响各不相同：有些伪影几乎不可见，而其他伪影则严重降低图像质量。我们认为应该根据伪影对人类观察者的显著性来表征它们，而不是将其视为统一的二元缺陷。

Method: 构建了一个包含1302个来自11种当代图像SR方法的伪影示例的数据集，每个伪影都配有众包显著性评分。基于该数据集，训练了一个轻量级回归器来生成空间显著性热图。

Result: 该方法在检测显著伪影方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 发布数据集和代码以促进基于显著性的SR伪影评估和缓解。

Abstract: Generative image super-resolution (SR) is rapidly advancing in visual quality
and detail restoration. As the capacity of SR models expands, however, so does
their tendency to produce artifacts: incorrect, visually disturbing details
that reduce perceived quality. Crucially, their perceptual impact varies: some
artifacts are barely noticeable while others strongly degrade the image. We
argue that artifacts should be characterized by their prominence to human
observers rather than treated as uniform binary defects. Motivated by this, we
present a novel dataset of 1302 artifact examples from 11 contemporary image-SR
methods, where each artifact is paired with a crowdsourced prominence score.
Building on this dataset, we train a lightweight regressor that produces
spatial prominence heatmaps and outperforms existing methods at detecting
prominent artifacts. We release the dataset and code to facilitate
prominence-aware evaluation and mitigation of SR artifacts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN方法在图像恢复中由于感受野小和缺乏通道特征建模，难以充分恢复精细纹理细节。

Method: 采用全局多尺度小波变换卷积(GMWTConvs)扩大感受野，引入Mamba通道感知模块(MCAM)捕获通道间长程依赖，并使用多尺度纹理增强损失(MTELoss)指导纹理结构保留。

Result: 实验证明WaMaIR在图像恢复任务中优于现有先进方法，同时保持高效计算性能。

Conclusion: WaMaIR框架通过扩大感受野和增强通道建模，有效提升了图像恢复中的纹理细节重建质量。

Abstract: Image restoration is a fundamental and challenging task in computer vision,
where CNN-based frameworks demonstrate significant computational efficiency.
However, previous CNN-based methods often face challenges in adequately
restoring fine texture details, which are limited by the small receptive field
of CNN structures and the lack of channel feature modeling. In this paper, we
propose WaMaIR, which is a novel framework with a large receptive field for
image perception and improves the reconstruction of texture details in restored
images. Specifically, we introduce the Global Multiscale Wavelet Transform
Convolutions (GMWTConvs) for expandding the receptive field to extract image
features, preserving and enriching texture features in model inputs. Meanwhile,
we propose the Mamba-Based Channel-Aware Module (MCAM), explicitly designed to
capture long-range dependencies within feature channels, which enhancing the
model sensitivity to color, edges, and texture information. Additionally, we
propose Multiscale Texture Enhancement Loss (MTELoss) for image restoration to
guide the model in preserving detailed texture structures effectively.
Extensive experiments confirm that WaMaIR outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving better image restoration and efficient computational performance of
the model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Region in Context框架，通过多级语义对齐实现文本条件图像编辑，使局部区域在全局图像上下文中进行协调编辑


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法孤立处理图像区域，仅依赖局部线索，导致编辑不一致、过渡不自然或整体连贯性丧失

Method: 引入双级引导机制：区域在全图像上下文中表示并与详细区域级描述对齐，同时整个图像与视觉语言模型生成的场景级描述匹配

Result: 实验表明该方法能产生更连贯且与指令对齐的编辑结果

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过多级语义对齐实现了更精确和协调的图像编辑

Abstract: Recent research has made significant progress in localizing and editing image
regions based on text. However, most approaches treat these regions in
isolation, relying solely on local cues without accounting for how each part
contributes to the overall visual and semantic composition. This often results
in inconsistent edits, unnatural transitions, or loss of coherence across the
image. In this work, we propose Region in Context, a novel framework for
text-conditioned image editing that performs multilevel semantic alignment
between vision and language, inspired by the human ability to reason about
edits in relation to the whole scene. Our method encourages each region to
understand its role within the global image context, enabling precise and
harmonized changes. At its core, the framework introduces a dual-level guidance
mechanism: regions are represented with full-image context and aligned with
detailed region-level descriptions, while the entire image is simultaneously
matched to a comprehensive scene-level description generated by a large
vision-language model. These descriptions serve as explicit verbal references
of the intended content, guiding both local modifications and global structure.
Experiments show that it produces more coherent and instruction-aligned
results. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了EMRRG框架，使用预训练的Mamba网络和参数高效微调方法进行X射线医疗报告生成，在基准数据集上取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗报告生成模型主要依赖大语言模型，对预训练视觉基础模型和先进微调技术探索有限，且忽略了非Transformer架构的潜力。

Method: 将X射线图像分块标记化，通过SSM-based视觉骨干提取特征，使用Partial LoRA进行参数高效微调，结合混合解码器的LLM生成医疗报告。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的基准数据集上的大量实验充分验证了所提策略的有效性。

Conclusion: EMRRG框架通过微调预训练Mamba网络实现了端到端训练，在X射线医疗报告生成任务中表现出色。

Abstract: X-ray image-based medical report generation (MRG) is a pivotal area in
artificial intelligence that can significantly reduce diagnostic burdens for
clinicians and patient wait times. Existing MRG models predominantly rely on
Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve report generation, with limited
exploration of pre-trained vision foundation models or advanced fine-tuning
techniques. Mainstream frameworks either avoid fine-tuning or utilize
simplistic methods like LoRA, often neglecting the potential of enhancing
cross-attention mechanisms. Additionally, while Transformer-based models
dominate vision-language tasks, non-Transformer architectures, such as the
Mamba network, remain underexplored for medical report generation, presenting a
promising avenue for future research. In this paper, we propose EMRRG, a novel
X-ray report generation framework that fine-tunes pre-trained Mamba networks
using parameter-efficient methods. Specifically, X-ray images are divided into
patches, tokenized, and processed by an SSM-based vision backbone for feature
extraction, with Partial LoRA yielding optimal performance. An LLM with a
hybrid decoder generates the medical report, enabling end-to-end training and
achieving strong results on benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments on three
widely used benchmark datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our
proposed strategies for the X-ray MRG. The source code of this paper will be
released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/Medical_Image_Analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GS2POSE是一种基于3D高斯泼溅的6D物体姿态估计新方法，通过可微分渲染和束调整优化，在纹理缺失和光照变化场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统6D姿态估计方法依赖2D-3D特征对应，在纹理缺失物体和变化光照条件下表现不佳，需要更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 基于束调整原理，利用李代数扩展3DGS构建姿态可微分渲染管线，通过迭代优化输入图像与渲染图像的差异来估计姿态，并更新3DGS颜色参数以适应光照变化。

Result: 在T-LESS、LineMod-Occlusion和LineMod数据集上分别实现了1.4%、2.8%和2.5%的精度提升。

Conclusion: GS2POSE通过结合3DGS和束调整，有效解决了纹理缺失和光照变化下的6D姿态估计问题，显著提升了估计精度。

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation of 3D objects is a fundamental task in computer
vision, and current research typically predicts the 6D pose by establishing
correspondences between 2D image features and 3D model features. However, these
methods often face difficulties with textureless objects and varying
illumination conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose GS2POSE, a
novel approach for 6D object pose estimation. GS2POSE formulates a pose
regression algorithm inspired by the principles of Bundle Adjustment (BA). By
leveraging Lie algebra, we extend the capabilities of 3DGS to develop a
pose-differentiable rendering pipeline, which iteratively optimizes the pose by
comparing the input image to the rendered image. Additionally, GS2POSE updates
color parameters within the 3DGS model, enhancing its adaptability to changes
in illumination. Compared to previous models, GS2POSE demonstrates accuracy
improvements of 1.4\%, 2.8\% and 2.5\% on the T-LESS, LineMod-Occlusion and
LineMod datasets, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的视频理解框架，通过结合预训练视觉语言模型的语义先验和传统机器学习算法，将视频理解重构为高维语义特征空间中的自监督时空聚类问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模视觉语言模型在静态图像上的零样本推理能力尚未充分应用于视频领域，传统视频理解模型依赖大量标注数据和特定任务训练，成本高且扩展性有限。

Method: 首先使用预训练VLM的冻结视觉编码器将视频流转换为语义特征轨迹，然后使用核时间分割(KTS)将连续特征流分割为离散的语义连贯事件段，最后通过无监督密度聚类识别重复出现的宏观场景和主题。

Result: 通过从每个发现的聚类中选择代表性关键帧，并利用VLM的生成能力进行文本描述，自动生成视频内容的结构化多模态摘要。

Conclusion: 该方法为零样本、自动化的视频内容结构分析提供了一条有效、可解释且模型无关的途径。

Abstract: The remarkable zero-shot reasoning capabilities of large-scale Visual
Language Models (VLMs) on static images have yet to be fully translated to the
video domain. Conventional video understanding models often rely on extensive,
task-specific training on annotated datasets, a process that is both costly and
limited in scalability. This paper introduces a novel, training-free framework
for video understanding that circumvents end-to-end training by synergistically
combining the rich semantic priors of pre-trained VLMs with classic machine
learning algorithms for pattern discovery. Our core idea is to reframe video
understanding as a self-supervised spatio-temporal clustering problem within a
high-dimensional semantic feature space. The proposed pipeline first transforms
a video stream into a semantic feature trajectory using the frozen visual
encoder of a pre-trained VLM. Subsequently, we employ Kernel Temporal
Segmentation (KTS), a robust machine learning technique, to partition the
continuous feature stream into discrete, semantically coherent event segments.
These segments are then subjected to unsupervised density-based clustering to
identify recurring macroscopic scenes and themes throughout the video. By
selecting representative keyframes from each discovered cluster and leveraging
the VLM's generative capabilities for textual description, our framework
automatically produces a structured, multi-modal summary of the video content.
This approach provides an effective, interpretable, and model-agnostic pathway
for zero-shot, automated structural analysis of video content.

TL;DR: LENS是一种新颖的即插即用解决方案，通过在完全冻结的MLLM上附加轻量级可训练头部，利用注意力图中的空间线索提取关键点，实现像素级分割，同时保持模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法需要微调MLLM以产生与掩码解码器兼容的特定输出，这会改变模型的输出空间并损害其内在泛化能力，违背了构建统一模型的目标。

Method: LENS在完全冻结的MLLM上附加轻量级可训练头部，通过精炼注意力图中的空间线索来提取关键点，并将其描述为与掩码解码器直接兼容的点级特征。

Result: LENS实现了与基于重新训练方法相当或更优的分割性能，同时完全保留了MLLM的泛化能力。

Conclusion: LENS的可附加设计为扩展MLLM建立了高效强大的范式，为真正多才多艺的统一模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Integrating diverse visual capabilities into a unified model is a significant
trend in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Among these, the inclusion
of segmentation poses a distinct set of challenges. To equip MLLMs with
pixel-level segmentation abilities, prevailing methods require finetuning the
model to produce specific outputs compatible with a mask decoder. This process
typically alters the model's output space and compromises its intrinsic
generalization, which undermines the goal of building a unified model. We
introduce LENS (Leveraging kEypoiNts for MLLMs' Segmentation), a novel
plug-and-play solution. LENS attaches a lightweight, trainable head to a
completely frozen MLLM. By refining the spatial cues embedded in attention
maps, LENS extracts keypoints and describes them into point-wise features
directly compatible with the mask decoder. Extensive experiments validate our
approach: LENS achieves segmentation performance competitive with or superior
to that of retraining-based methods. Crucially, it does so while fully
preserving the MLLM's generalization capabilities, which are significantly
degraded by finetuning approaches. As such, the attachable design of LENS
establishes an efficient and powerful paradigm for extending MLLMs, paving the
way for truly multi-talented, unified models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 消除对昂贵人工标注数据集的依赖，为自动驾驶提供可扩展的无监督道路分割解决方案。

Method: 首先基于几何先验生成弱标签（地平线以上为非道路，车辆前方四边形为道路），然后通过跨帧跟踪局部特征点并利用互信息最大化来增强时序一致性。

Result: 在Cityscapes数据集上实现了0.82的IoU分数，表现出高准确性和简单设计。

Conclusion: 结合几何约束和时序一致性为自动驾驶中的可扩展无监督道路分割提供了有效途径。

Abstract: This paper presents a fully unsupervised approach for binary road
segmentation (road vs. non-road), eliminating the reliance on costly manually
labeled datasets. The method leverages scene geometry and temporal cues to
distinguish road from non-road regions. Weak labels are first generated from
geometric priors, marking pixels above the horizon as non-road and a predefined
quadrilateral in front of the vehicle as road. In a refinement stage, temporal
consistency is enforced by tracking local feature points across frames and
penalizing inconsistent label assignments using mutual information
maximization. This enhances both precision and temporal stability. On the
Cityscapes dataset, the model achieves an Intersection-over-Union (IoU) of
0.82, demonstrating high accuracy with a simple design. These findings
demonstrate the potential of combining geometric constraints and temporal
consistency for scalable unsupervised road segmentation in autonomous driving.

Motivation: 现有方法无法从参考图像中学习有意义的摄影概念，或者无法保持内容图像的内容完整性。摄影风格作为特定摄影概念的组合，是著名摄影师魅力的来源。

Method: 基于预训练文本到图像扩散模型，使用文本反演技术优化摄影概念的提示词，学习参考图像的摄影风格。

Conclusion: PIF能够有效学习摄影概念的平均外观，并根据文本提示调整这些概念，实现高质量的摄影风格迁移。

Abstract: Photographic style, as a composition of certain photographic concepts, is the
charm behind renowned photographers. But learning and transferring photographic
style need a profound understanding of how the photo is edited from the unknown
original appearance. Previous works either fail to learn meaningful
photographic concepts from reference images, or cannot preserve the content of
the content image. To tackle these issues, we proposed a Personalized Image
Filter (PIF). Based on a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model, the
generative prior enables PIF to learn the average appearance of photographic
concepts, as well as how to adjust them according to text prompts. PIF then
learns the photographic style of reference images with the textual inversion
technique, by optimizing the prompts for the photographic concepts. PIF shows
outstanding performance in extracting and transferring various kinds of
photographic style. Project page: https://pif.pages.dev/

Abstract: Lychee is a high-value subtropical fruit. The adoption of vision-based
harvesting robots can significantly improve productivity while reduce reliance
on labor. High-quality data are essential for developing such harvesting
robots. However, there are currently no consistently and comprehensively
annotated open-source lychee datasets featuring fruits in natural growing
environments. To address this, we constructed a dataset to facilitate lychee
detection and maturity classification. Color (RGB) images were acquired under
diverse weather conditions, and at different times of the day, across multiple
lychee varieties, such as Nuomici, Feizixiao, Heiye, and Huaizhi. The dataset
encompasses three different ripeness stages and contains 11,414 images,
consisting of 878 raw RGB images, 8,780 augmented RGB images, and 1,756 depth
images. The images are annotated with 9,658 pairs of lables for lychee
detection and maturity classification. To improve annotation consistency, three
individuals independently labeled the data, and their results were then
aggregated and verified by a fourth reviewer. Detailed statistical analyses
were done to examine the dataset. Finally, we performed experiments using three
representative deep learning models to evaluate the dataset. It is publicly

Conclusion: ReefNet为领域泛化和细粒度珊瑚分类提供了具有挑战性的基准，将促进鲁棒、领域自适应的全球珊瑚礁监测与保护。

Abstract: Coral reefs are rapidly declining due to anthropogenic pressures such as
climate change, underscoring the urgent need for scalable, automated
monitoring. We introduce ReefNet, a large public coral reef image dataset with
point-label annotations mapped to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS).
ReefNet aggregates imagery from 76 curated CoralNet sources and an additional
site from Al Wajh in the Red Sea, totaling approximately 925000 genus-level
hard coral annotations with expert-verified labels. Unlike prior datasets,
which are often limited by size, geography, or coarse labels and are not
ML-ready, ReefNet offers fine-grained, taxonomically mapped labels at a global
scale to WoRMS. We propose two evaluation settings: (i) a within-source
benchmark that partitions each source's images for localized evaluation, and
(ii) a cross-source benchmark that withholds entire sources to test domain
generalization. We analyze both supervised and zero-shot classification
performance on ReefNet and find that while supervised within-source performance
is promising, supervised performance drops sharply across domains, and
performance is low across the board for zero-shot models, especially for rare
and visually similar genera. This provides a challenging benchmark intended to
catalyze advances in domain generalization and fine-grained coral
classification. We will release our dataset, benchmarking code, and pretrained
models to advance robust, domain-adaptive, global coral reef monitoring and
conservation.

Conclusion: AdaptMoist作为跨领域木屑水分含量估计的稳健解决方案非常有效，有望成为依赖木屑行业的潜在解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate and quick prediction of wood chip moisture content is critical for
optimizing biofuel production and ensuring energy efficiency. The current
widely used direct method (oven drying) is limited by its longer processing
time and sample destructiveness. On the other hand, existing indirect methods,
including near-infrared spectroscopy-based, electrical capacitance-based, and
image-based approaches, are quick but not accurate when wood chips come from
various sources. Variability in the source material can alter data
distributions, undermining the performance of data-driven models. Therefore,
there is a need for a robust approach that effectively mitigates the impact of
source variability. Previous studies show that manually extracted texture
features have the potential to predict wood chip moisture class. Building on
this, in this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of five distinct
texture feature types extracted from wood chip images to predict moisture
content. Our findings reveal that a combined feature set incorporating all five
texture features achieves an accuracy of 95% and consistently outperforms
individual texture features in predicting moisture content. To ensure robust
moisture prediction, we propose a domain adaptation method named AdaptMoist
that utilizes the texture features to transfer knowledge from one source of
wood chip data to another, addressing variability across different domains. We
also proposed a criterion for model saving based on adjusted mutual
information. The AdaptMoist method improves prediction accuracy across domains
by 23%, achieving an average accuracy of 80%, compared to 57% for non-adapted
models. These results highlight the effectiveness of AdaptMoist as a robust
solution for wood chip moisture content estimation across domains, making it a
potential solution for wood chip-reliant industries.

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，M2HVideo在服装一致性、身份保持和视频保真度方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: M2HVideo框架有效解决了人台到人类视频转换中的关键挑战，实现了高质量的身份可控视频生成。

Abstract: Mannequin-based clothing displays offer a cost-effective alternative to
real-model showcases for online fashion presentation, but lack realism and
expressive detail. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new task called
mannequin-to-human (M2H) video generation, which aims to synthesize
identity-controllable, photorealistic human videos from footage of mannequins.
We propose M2HVideo, a pose-aware and identity-preserving video generation
framework that addresses two key challenges: the misalignment between head and
body motion, and identity drift caused by temporal modeling. In particular,
M2HVideo incorporates a dynamic pose-aware head encoder that fuses facial
semantics with body pose to produce consistent identity embeddings across
frames. To address the loss of fine facial details due to latent space
compression, we introduce a mirror loss applied in pixel space through a
denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM)-based one-step denoising.
Additionally, we design a distribution-aware adapter that aligns statistical
distributions of identity and clothing features to enhance temporal coherence.
Extensive experiments on the UBC fashion dataset, our self-constructed ASOS
dataset, and the newly collected MannequinVideos dataset captured on-site
demonstrate that M2HVideo achieves superior performance in terms of clothing
consistency, identity preservation, and video fidelity in comparison to
state-of-the-art methods.

*Haofan Ren,Qingsong Yan,Ming Lu,Rongfeng Lu,Zunjie Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出2DGS-R方法，通过分层训练策略在保持几何精度的同时提升渲染质量，仅需1%额外存储和少量训练时间即可实现高质量渲染效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS难以准确表示表面，而2DGS虽然几何保真度有所提升但渲染质量仍受影响，目前无法在单阶段训练中同时优化几何和渲染质量。

Method: 采用分层训练：首先用法向一致性正则化训练原始2D高斯；然后选择渲染质量不足的2D高斯进行原地克隆操作；最后冻结不透明度进行微调。

Result: 相比原始2DGS仅需1%额外存储和少量训练时间，实现了高质量渲染结果同时保留了精细几何结构。

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了效率与性能，在视觉保真度和几何重建精度方面均有提升。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly influenced
neural fields, as it enables high-fidelity rendering with impressive visual
quality. However, 3DGS has difficulty accurately representing surfaces. In
contrast, 2DGS transforms the 3D volume into a collection of 2D planar Gaussian
disks. Despite advancements in geometric fidelity, rendering quality remains
compromised, highlighting the challenge of achieving both high-quality
rendering and precise geometric structures. This indicates that optimizing both
geometric and rendering quality in a single training stage is currently
unfeasible. To overcome this limitation, we present 2DGS-R, a new method that
uses a hierarchical training approach to improve rendering quality while
maintaining geometric accuracy. 2DGS-R first trains the original 2D Gaussians
with the normal consistency regularization. Then 2DGS-R selects the 2D
Gaussians with inadequate rendering quality and applies a novel in-place
cloning operation to enhance the 2D Gaussians. Finally, we fine-tune the 2DGS-R
model with opacity frozen. Experimental results show that compared to the
original 2DGS, our method requires only 1\% more storage and minimal additional
training time. Despite this negligible overhead, it achieves high-quality
rendering results while preserving fine geometric structures. These findings
indicate that our approach effectively balances efficiency with performance,
leading to improvements in both visual fidelity and geometric reconstruction
accuracy.

TL;DR: ArmFormer是一个轻量级基于Transformer的语义分割框架，通过集成CBAM注意力模块和MixVisionTransformer架构，在保持计算效率的同时实现武器像素级分割，适用于边缘设备部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统武器检测方法只能提供粗略的边界框定位，缺乏细粒度分割能力；现有语义分割模型要么牺牲精度追求效率，要么计算资源需求过高，不适合边缘部署场景。

Method: 结合CBAM增强的编码器主干和注意力集成汉堡解码器，采用MixVisionTransformer架构，实现五类武器（手枪、步枪、刀、左轮手枪、人）的语义分割。

Conclusion: ArmFormer是部署在便携安全摄像头、监控无人机和嵌入式AI加速器上的最优解决方案，在分布式安全基础设施中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: The escalating threat of weapon-related violence necessitates automated
detection systems capable of pixel-level precision for accurate threat
assessment in real-time security applications. Traditional weapon detection
approaches rely on object detection frameworks that provide only coarse
bounding box localizations, lacking the fine-grained segmentation required for
comprehensive threat analysis. Furthermore, existing semantic segmentation
models either sacrifice accuracy for computational efficiency or require
excessive computational resources incompatible with edge deployment scenarios.
This paper presents ArmFormer, a lightweight transformer-based semantic
segmentation framework that strategically integrates Convolutional Block
Attention Module (CBAM) with MixVisionTransformer architecture to achieve
superior accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for
resource-constrained edge devices. Our approach combines CBAM-enhanced encoder
backbone with attention-integrated hamburger decoder to enable multi-class
weapon segmentation across five categories: handgun, rifle, knife, revolver,
and human. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ArmFormer achieves
state-of-the-art performance with 80.64% mIoU and 89.13% mFscore while
maintaining real-time inference at 82.26 FPS. With only 4.886G FLOPs and 3.66M
parameters, ArmFormer outperforms heavyweight models requiring up to 48x more
computation, establishing it as the optimal solution for deployment on portable
security cameras, surveillance drones, and embedded AI accelerators in
distributed security infrastructure.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BARL是一个半监督医学图像分割框架，通过在表示空间和标签空间进行双边对齐，显著提升了分割性能，同时减少了标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的半监督医学图像分割方法主要依赖标签空间一致性，但忽视了表示空间对齐的重要性。没有协调潜在特征，模型难以学习既具有判别性又空间一致的表示。

Method: 提出BARL框架，包含两个协作分支，在标签空间使用双路径正则化和渐进认知偏差校正实现对齐，在表示空间通过区域级和病灶实例匹配来对齐特征表示。

Result: 在四个公共基准数据集和一个私有CBCT数据集上的实验表明，BARL持续超越最先进的半监督医学图像分割方法。消融研究验证了各组件的贡献。

Conclusion: BARL通过双边对齐策略有效解决了半监督医学图像分割中的表示空间对齐问题，显著提升了分割性能，代码即将发布。

Abstract: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS) seeks to match fully
supervised performance while sharply reducing annotation cost. Mainstream SSMIS
methods rely on \emph{label-space consistency}, yet they overlook the equally
critical \emph{representation-space alignment}. Without harmonizing latent
features, models struggle to learn representations that are both discriminative
and spatially coherent. To this end, we introduce \textbf{Bilateral Alignment
in Representation and Label spaces (BARL)}, a unified framework that couples
two collaborative branches and enforces alignment in both spaces. For
label-space alignment, inspired by co-training and multi-scale decoding, we
devise \textbf{Dual-Path Regularization (DPR)} and \textbf{Progressively
Cognitive Bias Correction (PCBC)} to impose fine-grained cross-branch
consistency while mitigating error accumulation from coarse to fine scales. For
representation-space alignment, we conduct region-level and lesion-instance
matching between branches, explicitly capturing the fragmented, complex
pathological patterns common in medical imagery. Extensive experiments on four
public benchmarks and a proprietary CBCT dataset demonstrate that BARL
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art SSMIS methods. Ablative studies further
validate the contribution of each component. Code will be released soon.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于配准的旋转不变特征提取框架，将点云配准与基于记忆库的异常检测相结合，解决现有方法在特征变换不一致和局部几何细节捕捉能力有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于记忆库的3D异常检测方法存在特征变换不一致和判别能力有限的问题，特别是在捕捉局部几何细节和实现旋转不变性方面。当配准失败时，这些问题会导致不可靠的检测结果。

Method: 提出配准诱导的旋转不变特征提取框架，将点云配准与基于记忆库的异常检测目标集成。通过将特征提取嵌入到配准学习过程中，联合优化对齐和表示学习。

Result: 在Anomaly-ShapeNet和Real3D-AD数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在有效性和泛化性方面持续优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过将特征提取与配准学习过程相结合，网络能够获得既对旋转具有鲁棒性又对异常检测高度有效的特征。

Abstract: 3D anomaly detection in point-cloud data is critical for industrial quality
control, aiming to identify structural defects with high reliability. However,
current memory bank-based methods often suffer from inconsistent feature
transformations and limited discriminative capacity, particularly in capturing
local geometric details and achieving rotation invariance. These limitations
become more pronounced when registration fails, leading to unreliable detection
results. We argue that point-cloud registration plays an essential role not
only in aligning geometric structures but also in guiding feature extraction
toward rotation-invariant and locally discriminative representations. To this
end, we propose a registration-induced, rotation-invariant feature extraction
framework that integrates the objectives of point-cloud registration and
memory-based anomaly detection. Our key insight is that both tasks rely on
modeling local geometric structures and leveraging feature similarity across
samples. By embedding feature extraction into the registration learning
process, our framework jointly optimizes alignment and representation learning.
This integration enables the network to acquire features that are both robust
to rotations and highly effective for anomaly detection. Extensive experiments
on the Anomaly-ShapeNet and Real3D-AD datasets demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms existing approaches in effectiveness and
generalizability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种神经元级别的分析框架，通过人类大脑活动研究视觉语言模型的多模态信息处理机制，发现人工神经元与生物神经元在功能网络、冗余性、极性模式和架构影响方面存在显著相似性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对人工神经网络与人类大脑处理之间相似性的理解有限：单模态研究无法捕捉大脑固有的多模态处理能力，而多模态研究主要关注高层模型输出，忽视了单个神经元的关键作用。

Method: 结合细粒度人工神经元分析和基于fMRI的体素编码，研究了CLIP和METER两种架构不同的视觉语言模型，通过神经元级别分析框架比较人工神经元与生物神经元的活动。

Result: 发现四个关键结果：1）人工神经元成功预测多个功能网络中生物神经元的活动；2）两者都表现出功能冗余性；3）人工神经元呈现与生物神经元相似的极性模式；4）不同架构驱动不同的生物神经元激活模式。

Conclusion: 这些结果为视觉语言模型中存在类脑层次处理提供了有力证据，表明在神经元级别上人工神经网络与人类大脑处理机制具有显著相似性。

Abstract: While brain-inspired artificial intelligence(AI) has demonstrated promising
results, current understanding of the parallels between artificial neural
networks (ANNs) and human brain processing remains limited: (1) unimodal ANN
studies fail to capture the brain's inherent multimodal processing
capabilities, and (2) multimodal ANN research primarily focuses on high-level
model outputs, neglecting the crucial role of individual neurons. To address
these limitations, we propose a novel neuron-level analysis framework that
investigates the multimodal information processing mechanisms in
vision-language models (VLMs) through the lens of human brain activity. Our
approach uniquely combines fine-grained artificial neuron (AN) analysis with
fMRI-based voxel encoding to examine two architecturally distinct VLMs: CLIP
and METER. Our analysis reveals four key findings: (1) ANs successfully predict
biological neurons (BNs) activities across multiple functional networks
(including language, vision, attention, and default mode), demonstrating shared
representational mechanisms; (2) Both ANs and BNs demonstrate functional
redundancy through overlapping neural representations, mirroring the brain's
fault-tolerant and collaborative information processing mechanisms; (3) ANs
exhibit polarity patterns that parallel the BNs, with oppositely activated BNs
showing mirrored activation trends across VLM layers, reflecting the complexity
and bidirectional nature of neural information processing; (4) The
architectures of CLIP and METER drive distinct BNs: CLIP's independent branches
show modality-specific specialization, whereas METER's cross-modal design
yields unified cross-modal activation, highlighting the architecture's
influence on ANN brain-like properties. These results provide compelling
evidence for brain-like hierarchical processing in VLMs at the neuronal level.

Motivation: 传统类别条件生成模型难以准确生成特定医学类别图像，限制了在皮肤癌诊断等应用中的实用性

Method: 在扩散模型中集成分类器，基于类别条件指导图像生成，实现更好的类别控制

Result: 模型能够生成更真实多样的图像，同时分类器性能也得到提升

Conclusion: Class-N-Diff是增强扩散模型合成皮肤镜图像质量和实用性的强大工具

Abstract: Generative models, especially Diffusion Models, have demonstrated remarkable
capability in generating high-quality synthetic data, including medical images.
However, traditional class-conditioned generative models often struggle to
generate images that accurately represent specific medical categories, limiting
their usefulness for applications such as skin cancer diagnosis. To address
this problem, we propose a classification-induced diffusion model, namely,
Class-N-Diff, to simultaneously generate and classify dermoscopic images. Our
Class-N-Diff model integrates a classifier within a diffusion model to guide
image generation based on its class conditions. Thus, the model has better
control over class-conditioned image synthesis, resulting in more realistic and
diverse images. Additionally, the classifier demonstrates improved performance,
highlighting its effectiveness for downstream diagnostic tasks. This unique
integration in our Class-N-Diff makes it a robust tool for enhancing the
quality and utility of diffusion model-based synthetic dermoscopic image
generation. Our code is available at https://github.com/Munia03/Class-N-Diff.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于监督微调的图像编辑模型容易过拟合到标注模式，限制了其在训练分布之外的泛化能力，需要一种能够探索和超越训练分布的方法。

Method: 使用Diffusion Negative-aware Finetuning (DiffusionNFT)策略优化方法，结合多模态大语言模型作为训练无关的统一奖励模型，并设计了低方差组过滤机制来减少评分噪声。

Result: UniWorld-V2在ImgEdit和GEdit-Bench基准测试中分别获得4.49和7.83分，达到最先进水平。该框架对Qwen-Image-Edit和FLUX-Kontext等不同基础模型都能带来显著性能提升。

Conclusion: Edit-R1是一个模型无关的框架，能够有效提升指令图像编辑的性能和泛化能力，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing has achieved remarkable progress; however,
models solely trained via supervised fine-tuning often overfit to annotated
patterns, hindering their ability to explore and generalize beyond training
distributions. To this end, we introduce Edit-R1, a novel post-training
framework for instruction-based image editing based on policy optimization.
Specifically, we utilize Diffusion Negative-aware Finetuning (DiffusionNFT), a
likelihood-free policy optimization method consistent with the flow matching
forward process, thereby enabling the use of higher-order samplers and more
efficient training. Another key challenge here is the absence of a universal
reward model, resulting from the diverse nature of editing instructions and
tasks. To bridge this gap, we employ a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)
as a unified, training-free reward model, leveraging its output logits to
provide fine-grained feedback. Furthermore, we carefully design a low-variance
group filtering mechanism to reduce MLLM scoring noise and stabilize
optimization. UniWorld-V2, trained with this framework, achieves
\textbf{state-of-the-art} results on the ImgEdit and GEdit-Bench benchmarks,
scoring 4.49 and 7.83, respectively. Crucially, our framework is
model-agnostic, delivering substantial performance gains when applied to
diverse base models like Qwen-Image-Edit and FLUX-Kontext, demonstrating its
wide applicability. Code and models are publicly available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于地面摄像机的凝结尾迹到航班归因框架，用于解决卫星归因方法在空间和时间分辨率上的限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航空业的非CO2效应（特别是凝结尾迹）对气候变化有重要影响，但验证和校准物理模型需要将观测到的凝结尾迹与生成它们的航班关联起来。卫星归因方法因空间和时间分辨率有限而面临挑战。

Method: 利用地面可见摄像机凝结尾迹序列(GVCCS)数据集，提出了一个模块化框架，将地面摄像机观测到的凝结尾迹与基于飞机监视和气象数据推导的理论凝结尾迹进行关联。该框架包含多种几何表示和距离度量，整合了时间平滑，并支持基于概率的灵活分配策略。

Result: 建立了一个强大的基线，为未来研究凝结尾迹与源航班关联提供了模块化框架。

Conclusion: 地面摄像机方法能够在凝结尾迹形成后不久以高空间和时间分辨率捕捉它们，此时凝结尾迹仍然较薄、线性且视觉上可区分，为凝结尾迹归因提供了有前景的替代方案。

Abstract: Aviation's non-CO2 effects, particularly contrails, are a significant
contributor to its climate impact. Persistent contrails can evolve into
cirrus-like clouds that trap outgoing infrared radiation, with radiative
forcing potentially comparable to or exceeding that of aviation's CO2
emissions. While physical models simulate contrail formation, evolution and
dissipation, validating and calibrating these models requires linking observed
contrails to the flights that generated them, a process known as
contrail-to-flight attribution. Satellite-based attribution is challenging due
to limited spatial and temporal resolution, as contrails often drift and deform
before detection. In this paper, we evaluate an alternative approach using
ground-based cameras, which capture contrails shortly after formation at high
spatial and temporal resolution, when they remain thin, linear, and visually
distinct. Leveraging the ground visible camera contrail sequences (GVCCS)
dataset, we introduce a modular framework for attributing contrails observed
using ground-based cameras to theoretical contrails derived from aircraft
surveillance and meteorological data. The framework accommodates multiple
geometric representations and distance metrics, incorporates temporal
smoothing, and enables flexible probability-based assignment strategies. This
work establishes a strong baseline and provides a modular framework for future
research in linking contrails to their source flight.

Abstract: Thermal weapon segmentation is crucial for surveillance and security
applications, enabling robust detection under lowlight and visually obscured
conditions where RGB-based systems fail. While convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) dominate thermal segmentation literature, their ability to capture
long-range dependencies and fine structural details is limited. Vision
Transformers (ViTs), with their global context modeling capabilities, have
achieved state-of-the-art results in RGB segmentation tasks, yet their
potential in thermal weapon segmentation remains underexplored. This work
adapts and evaluates four transformer-based architectures SegFormer,
DeepLabV3\+, SegNeXt, and Swin Transformer for binary weapon segmentation on a
custom thermal dataset comprising 9,711 images collected from real world
surveillance videos and automatically annotated using SAM2. We employ standard
augmentation strategies within the MMSegmentation framework to ensure robust
model training and fair architectural comparison. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements in segmentation performance: SegFormer-b5
achieves the highest mIoU (94.15\%) and Pixel Accuracy (97.04\%), while
SegFormer-b0 provides the fastest inference speed (98.32 FPS) with competitive
mIoU (90.84\%). SegNeXt-mscans offers balanced performance with 85.12 FPS and
92.24\% mIoU, and DeepLabV3\+ R101-D8 reaches 92.76\% mIoU at 29.86 FPS. The
transformer architectures demonstrate robust generalization capabilities for
weapon detection in low-light and occluded thermal environments, with flexible
accuracy-speed trade-offs suitable for diverse real-time security applications.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly support dynamic image

whether performance remains stable across varying input resolutions. To address
this gap, we introduce \textbf{Res-Bench}, a comprehensive benchmark comprising
14,400 samples across 12 resolution levels and six core capability dimensions.
We designed a novel evaluation framework that goes beyond traditional accuracy
metrics to capture performance stability. This framework introduces multiple
robustness metrics: Spearman's correlation for assessing resolution-performance
trends, and Absolute/Relative Continuous Error (ACE/RCE) for measuring
performance volatility. Using these metrics, we conducted a large-scale
evaluation of leading MLLMs. Our analysis encompasses: (1) model-centric and
task-centric robustness examination, (2) investigation of preprocessing
strategies including padding and super-resolution, and (3) exploration of
fine-tuning for stability enhancement.

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly foundation
models (FMs), have revolutionized medical image analysis, demonstrating strong
zero- and few-shot performance across diverse medical imaging tasks, from
segmentation to report generation. Unlike traditional task-specific AI models,
FMs leverage large corpora of labeled and unlabeled multimodal datasets to
learn generalized representations that can be adapted to various downstream
clinical applications with minimal fine-tuning. However, despite the rapid
proliferation of FM research in medical imaging, the field remains fragmented,
lacking a unified synthesis that systematically maps the evolution of
architectures, training paradigms, and clinical applications across modalities.
To address this gap, this review article provides a comprehensive and
structured analysis of FMs in medical image analysis. We systematically
categorize studies into vision-only and vision-language FMs based on their
architectural foundations, training strategies, and downstream clinical tasks.
Additionally, a quantitative meta-analysis of the studies was conducted to
characterize temporal trends in dataset utilization and application domains. We
also critically discuss persistent challenges, including domain adaptation,
efficient fine-tuning, computational constraints, and interpretability along
with emerging solutions such as federated learning, knowledge distillation, and
advanced prompting. Finally, we identify key future research directions aimed
at enhancing the robustness, explainability, and clinical integration of FMs,
thereby accelerating their translation into real-world medical practice.

Abstract: Diffusion and flow models achieve high generative quality but remain
computationally expensive due to slow multi-step sampling. Distillation methods
accelerate them by training fast student generators, yet most existing
objectives lack a unified theoretical foundation. In this work, we propose
Di-Bregman, a compact framework that formulates diffusion distillation as
Bregman divergence-based density-ratio matching. This convex-analytic view
connects several existing objectives through a common lens. Experiments on
CIFAR-10 and text-to-image generation demonstrate that Di-Bregman achieves
improved one-step FID over reverse-KL distillation and maintains high visual
fidelity compared to the teacher model. Our results highlight Bregman
density-ratio matching as a practical and theoretically-grounded route toward
efficient one-step diffusion generation.

Abstract: The recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) from event-triggered
ambient sensors is an essential task in Ambient Assisted Living, yet existing
methods remain constrained by representation-level limitations. Sequence-based
approaches preserve temporal order of sensor activations but are sensitive to
noise and lack spatial awareness, while image-based approaches capture global
patterns and implicit spatial correlations but compress fine-grained temporal
dynamics and distort sensor layouts. Naive fusion (e.g., feature concatenation)
fail to enforce alignment between sequence- and image-based representation
views, underutilizing their complementary strengths. We propose Contrastive
Alignment for ADL Recognition from Event-Triggered Sensor Streams (CARE), an
end-to-end framework that jointly optimizes representation learning via
Sequence-Image Contrastive Alignment (SICA) and classification via
cross-entropy, ensuring both cross-representation alignment and task-specific
discriminability. CARE integrates (i) time-aware, noise-resilient sequence
encoding with (ii) spatially-informed and frequency-sensitive image
representations, and employs (iii) a joint contrastive-classification objective
for end-to-end learning of aligned and discriminative embeddings. Evaluated on
three CASAS datasets, CARE achieves state-of-the-art performance (89.8% on
Milan, 88.9% on Cairo, and 73.3% on Kyoto7) and demonstrates robustness to
sensor malfunctions and layout variability, highlighting its potential for
reliable ADL recognition in smart homes.

Abstract: Given a task and a set of steps composing it, Video Step Grounding (VSG) aims
to detect which steps are performed in a video. Standard approaches for this
task require a labeled training set (e.g., with step-level annotations or
narrations), which may be costly to collect. Moreover, they process the full
video offline, limiting their applications for scenarios requiring online
decisions. Thus, in this work, we explore how to perform VSG online and without
training. We achieve this by exploiting the zero-shot capabilities of recent
Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). In particular, we use LMMs to predict the step
associated with a restricted set of frames, without access to the whole video.
We show that this online strategy without task-specific tuning outperforms
offline and training-based models. Motivated by this finding, we develop
Bayesian Grounding with Large Multimodal Models (BaGLM), further injecting
knowledge of past frames into the LMM-based predictions. BaGLM exploits
Bayesian filtering principles, modeling step transitions via (i) a dependency
matrix extracted through large language models and (ii) an estimation of step
progress. Experiments on three datasets show superior performance of BaGLM over
state-of-the-art training-based offline methods.

Motivation: 当前时序视频定位研究过于集中在少数视频表示方法上，可能导致架构过拟合。需要研究不同视频特征对经典架构的影响。

Method: 在三个基准数据集上使用基于CNN、时序推理和transformer的视频编码器提取特征，并在经典架构上进行对比实验。

Abstract: Temporal video grounding is a fundamental task in computer vision, aiming to
localize a natural language query in a long, untrimmed video. It has a key role
in the scientific community, in part due to the large amount of video generated
every day. Although we find extensive work in this task, we note that research
remains focused on a small selection of video representations, which may lead
to architectural overfitting in the long run. To address this issue, we propose
an empirical study to investigate the impact of different video features on a
classical architecture. We extract features for three well-known benchmarks,
Charades-STA, ActivityNet-Captions and YouCookII, using video encoders based on
CNNs, temporal reasoning and transformers. Our results show significant
differences in the performance of our model by simply changing the video
encoder, while also revealing clear patterns and errors derived from the use of
certain features, ultimately indicating potential feature complementarity.

Abstract: Foundation models have advanced machine learning across various modalities,
including images. Recently multiple teams trained foundation models specialized
for remote sensing applications. This line of research is motivated by the
distinct characteristics of remote sensing imagery, specific applications and
types of robustness useful for satellite image analysis. In this work we
systematically challenge the idea that specific foundation models are more
useful than general-purpose vision foundation models, at least in the small
scale. First, we design a simple benchmark that measures generalization of
remote sensing models towards images with lower resolution for two downstream
tasks. Second, we train iBOT, a self-supervised vision encoder, on MillionAID,
an ImageNet-scale satellite imagery dataset, with several modifications
specific to remote sensing. We show that none of those pretrained models bring
consistent improvements upon general-purpose baselines at the ViT-B scale.

Motivation: 利用多模态大语言模型的能力来联合处理文本和视频，有效定位视频中的自然语言查询，解决直接定位时可能出现的细节缺失和幻觉问题。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先将语言查询转换为包含缺失细节和线索的增强句子，然后使用轻量级解码器基于增强查询的上下文表示预测准确边界，并通过多实例学习目标动态选择最佳查询版本。

Result: 在视频时序定位和段落定位设置中，该方法显著优于所有先前提出的基于LLM的时序定位方法，在零样本评估场景中保持明显优势。

Conclusion: ED-VTG方法在视频时序定位任务中表现出色，既优于或可与专门模型相媲美，同时在零样本评估中具有明显优势，验证了多模态LLM在细粒度视频定位中的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce ED-VTG, a method for fine-grained video temporal grounding
utilizing multi-modal large language models. Our approach harnesses the
capabilities of multimodal LLMs to jointly process text and video, in order to
effectively localize natural language queries in videos through a two-stage
process. Rather than being directly grounded, language queries are initially
transformed into enriched sentences that incorporate missing details and cues
to aid in grounding. In the second stage, these enriched queries are grounded,
using a lightweight decoder, which specializes at predicting accurate
boundaries conditioned on contextualized representations of the enriched
queries. To mitigate noise and reduce the impact of hallucinations, our model
is trained with a multiple-instance-learning objective that dynamically selects
the optimal version of the query for each training sample. We demonstrate
state-of-the-art results across various benchmarks in temporal video grounding
and paragraph grounding settings. Experiments reveal that our method
significantly outperforms all previously proposed LLM-based temporal grounding
approaches and is either superior or comparable to specialized models, while
maintaining a clear advantage against them in zero-shot evaluation scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态3D定位模型存在严重的"2D语义偏差"，过度依赖2D图像特征进行粗定位，而忽视3D几何输入，导致融合性能不佳。

Method: W2R2框架将2D特征指定为语义信标进行"是什么"识别，3D特征作为空间锚点进行"在哪里"定位，采用双目标损失函数，包括用于多模态协同的对齐损失和通过边际机制惩罚2D主导伪输出的伪标签损失。

Result: 在ScanRefer和ScanQA数据集上的实验表明，W2R2在定位精度和鲁棒性方面取得显著提升，特别是在杂乱户外场景中。

Conclusion: W2R2通过解耦表示学习和针对性捷径抑制，有效解决了多模态3D定位中的2D语义偏差问题，显著提升了模型的3D定位性能。

Abstract: Multimodal 3D grounding has garnered considerable interest in Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) \cite{yin2025spatial} for advancing spatial reasoning in complex
environments. However, these models suffer from a severe "2D semantic bias"
that arises from over-reliance on 2D image features for coarse localization,
largely disregarding 3D geometric inputs and resulting in suboptimal fusion
performance. In this paper, we propose a novel training framework called
What-Where Representation Re-Forming (W2R2) to tackle this issue via
disentangled representation learning and targeted shortcut suppression. Our
approach fundamentally reshapes the model's internal space by designating 2D
features as semantic beacons for "What" identification and 3D features as
spatial anchors for "Where" localization, enabling precise 3D grounding without
modifying inference architecture. Key components include a dual-objective loss
function with an Alignment Loss that supervises fused predictions using adapted
cross-entropy for multimodal synergy, and a Pseudo-Label Loss that penalizes
overly effective 2D-dominant pseudo-outputs via a margin-based mechanism.
Experiments conducted on ScanRefer and ScanQA demonstrate the effectiveness of
W2R2, with significant gains in localization accuracy and robustness,
particularly in cluttered outdoor scenes.

Abstract: Large fingerprint datasets, while important for training and evaluation, are
time-consuming and expensive to collect and require strict privacy measures.
Researchers are exploring the use of synthetic fingerprint data to address
these issues. This paper presents a novel approach for generating synthetic
fingerprint images (both spoof and live), addressing concerns related to
privacy, cost, and accessibility in biometric data collection. Our approach
utilizes conditional StyleGAN2-ADA and StyleGAN3 architectures to produce
high-resolution synthetic live fingerprints, conditioned on specific finger
identities (thumb through little finger). Additionally, we employ CycleGANs to
translate these into realistic spoof fingerprints, simulating a variety of
presentation attack materials (e.g., EcoFlex, Play-Doh). These synthetic spoof
fingerprints are crucial for developing robust spoof detection systems. Through
these generative models, we created two synthetic datasets (DB2 and DB3), each
containing 1,500 fingerprint images of all ten fingers with multiple
impressions per finger, and including corresponding spoofs in eight material
types. The results indicate robust performance: our StyleGAN3 model achieves a
Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) as low as 5, and the generated fingerprints
achieve a True Accept Rate of 99.47% at a 0.01% False Accept Rate. The
StyleGAN2-ADA model achieved a TAR of 98.67% at the same 0.01% FAR. We assess
fingerprint quality using standard metrics (NFIQ2, MINDTCT), and notably,
matching experiments confirm strong privacy preservation, with no significant
evidence of identity leakage, confirming the strong privacy-preserving
properties of our synthetic datasets.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个临床医生参与的深度学习管道，用于肺癌CT图像分割和预后预测。VNet模型在分割性能、放射组学稳定性和预测准确性方面表现最佳，半监督学习始终优于监督学习。放射科医生更倾向于使用AI生成的初始掩模进行精炼而非完全替代。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肺癌是癌症死亡的主要原因，CT成像在筛查、预后和治疗中至关重要。手动分割存在变异性且耗时，而深度学习虽然提供自动化但面临临床采用障碍。本研究旨在通过临床医生参与的深度学习管道提高可重复性、预后准确性和临床信任度。

Method: 使用来自12个公共数据集的999名患者的多中心CT数据，采用五种深度学习模型（3D Attention U-Net、ResUNet、VNet、ReconNet、SAM-Med3D），在完整图像和点击点裁剪图像上与专家轮廓进行基准测试。通过497个PySERA提取的放射组学特征评估分割可重复性，并比较监督学习和半监督学习在38种降维策略和24种分类器上的预后建模性能。六名医生在七个领域对掩模进行定性评估。

Result: VNet实现了最佳性能（Dice = 0.83，IoU = 0.71）、放射组学稳定性（平均相关性 = 0.76，ICC = 0.65）和半监督学习下的预测准确性（准确率 = 0.88，F1 = 0.83）。半监督学习在所有模型中始终优于监督学习。放射科医生更倾向于VNet的瘤周表示和更平滑的边界，偏好使用AI生成的初始掩模进行精炼而非完全替代。

Conclusion: 将VNet与半监督学习相结合，能够产生准确、可重复且临床可信的基于CT的肺癌预后结果，突显了向以医生为中心的AI转化的可行路径。

Abstract: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer mortality, with CT imaging
central to screening, prognosis, and treatment. Manual segmentation is variable
and time-intensive, while deep learning (DL) offers automation but faces
barriers to clinical adoption. Guided by the Knowledge-to-Action framework,
this study develops a clinician-in-the-loop DL pipeline to enhance
reproducibility, prognostic accuracy, and clinical trust. Multi-center CT data
from 999 patients across 12 public datasets were analyzed using five DL models
(3D Attention U-Net, ResUNet, VNet, ReconNet, SAM-Med3D), benchmarked against
expert contours on whole and click-point cropped images. Segmentation
reproducibility was assessed using 497 PySERA-extracted radiomic features via
Spearman correlation, ICC, Wilcoxon tests, and MANOVA, while prognostic
modeling compared supervised (SL) and semi-supervised learning (SSL) across 38
dimensionality reduction strategies and 24 classifiers. Six physicians
qualitatively evaluated masks across seven domains, including clinical
meaningfulness, boundary quality, prognostic value, trust, and workflow
integration. VNet achieved the best performance (Dice = 0.83, IoU = 0.71),
radiomic stability (mean correlation = 0.76, ICC = 0.65), and predictive
accuracy under SSL (accuracy = 0.88, F1 = 0.83). SSL consistently outperformed
SL across models. Radiologists favored VNet for peritumoral representation and
smoother boundaries, preferring AI-generated initial masks for refinement
rather than replacement. These results demonstrate that integrating VNet with
SSL yields accurate, reproducible, and clinically trusted CT-based lung cancer
prognosis, highlighting a feasible path toward physician-centered AI
translation.

Abstract: Advanced feature extraction methods have significantly contributed to
enhancing the task of person re-identification. In addition, modifications to
objective functions have been developed to further improve performance.
Nonetheless, selecting better class representatives is an underexplored area of
research that can also lead to advancements in re-identification performance.
Although past works have experimented with using the centroid of a gallery
image class during training, only a few have investigated alternative
representations during the retrieval stage. In this paper, we demonstrate that
these prior techniques yield suboptimal results in terms of re-identification
metrics. To address the re-identification problem, we propose a generalized
selection method that involves choosing representations that are not limited to
class centroids. Our approach strikes a balance between accuracy and mean
average precision, leading to improvements beyond the state of the art. For
example, the actual number of representations per class can be adjusted to meet
specific application requirements. We apply our methodology on top of multiple
re-identification embeddings, and in all cases it substantially improves upon
contemporary results

Conclusion: 基于熵的推理时优化能有效提升LMM的视频推理能力，无需额外训练即可获得接近RL模型的性能，同时大幅提升效率。

Abstract: Video reasoning using Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) relies on costly
reinforcement learning (RL) and verbose chain-of-thought, resulting in
substantial computational overhead during both training and inference.
Moreover, the mechanisms that control the thinking process in these reasoning
models are very limited. In this paper, using entropy of the model's output as
a signal, we discover that the high-quality models go through a series of
micro-explorations and micro-exploitations which keep the reasoning process
grounded (i.e., avoid excessive randomness while the model is exploring or
thinking through an answer). We further observe that once this "thinking"
process is over, more accurate models demonstrate a better convergence by
reducing the entropy significantly via a final exploitation phase (i.e., a more
certain convergence towards a solution trajectory). We then use these novel,
theoretically-grounded insights to tune the model's behavior directly at
inference, without using any RL or supervised fine-tuning. Specifically, during
inference, our proposed approach called V-Reason (Video-Reason) adapts the
value cache of the LMM via a few optimization steps on a small, trainable
controller using an entropy-based objective, i.e., no supervision from any
dataset or RL is necessary. This tuning improves the model's micro-exploration
and exploitation behavior during inference. Our experiments show that our
proposed method achieves significant improvements over the base
instruction-tuned models across several video reasoning datasets, narrowing the
gap with RL-trained models to within 0.6% average accuracy without any
training, while offering massive efficiency benefits: output tokens are reduced
by 58.6% compared to the RL model.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中表现优异，但由于注意力计算的二次增长导致计算开销巨大。现有方法缺乏对MLLMs处理多模态信息机制的基本理解。

Method: 通过系统分析发现三阶段跨模态交互过程：浅层识别任务意图、中层关键视觉token驱动融合、深层丢弃视觉token专注语言精炼。基于此提出VisiPruner训练无关剪枝框架。

Result: 在LLaVA-v1.5 7B上减少高达99%的视觉相关注意力计算和53.9%的FLOPs，显著优于现有token剪枝方法，并在多种MLLMs上具有良好泛化性。

Conclusion: 除了剪枝，研究结果还为训练高效MLLMs提供了可操作指导，通过使模型架构与其内在层级处理动态对齐来提升效率。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance
across vision-language tasks, but suffer from significant computational
overhead due to the quadratic growth of attention computations with the number
of multimodal tokens. Though efforts have been made to prune tokens in MLLMs,
\textit{they lack a fundamental understanding of how MLLMs process and fuse
multimodal information.} Through systematic analysis, we uncover a
\textbf{three-stage} cross-modal interaction process: (1) Shallow layers
recognize task intent, with visual tokens acting as passive attention sinks;
(2) Cross-modal fusion occurs abruptly in middle layers, driven by a few
critical visual tokens; (3) Deep layers discard vision tokens, focusing solely
on linguistic refinement. Based on these findings, we propose
\emph{VisiPruner}, a training-free pruning framework that reduces up to 99\% of
vision-related attention computations and 53.9\% of FLOPs on LLaVA-v1.5 7B. It
significantly outperforms existing token pruning methods and generalizes across
diverse MLLMs. Beyond pruning, our insights further provide actionable
guidelines for training efficient MLLMs by aligning model architecture with its
intrinsic layer-wise processing dynamics. Our code is available at:

Result: SAM2在深度估计等空间任务上表现优异，但在姿态估计和图像描述等语义任务上不如Hiera，显示专用化导致语义信息损失。

Conclusion: 专用化在提升特定任务性能的同时会牺牲特征通用性，为下游应用的特征编码和适应策略设计提供了量化指导。

Abstract: The trade-off between general-purpose foundation vision models and their
specialized counterparts is critical for efficient feature coding design and is
not yet fully understood. We investigate this trade-off by comparing the
feature versatility of the general-purpose Hiera encoder against the
segmentation-specialized Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). Using a lightweight,
trainable neck to probe the adaptability of their frozen features, we quantify
the information-theoretic cost of specialization. Our results reveal that while
SAM2's specialization is highly effective for spatially-related tasks like
depth estimation, it comes at a cost. The specialized SAM2 encoder
underperforms its generalist predecessor, Hiera, on conceptually distant tasks
such as pose estimation and image captioning, demonstrating a measurable loss
of broader semantic information. A novel cross-neck analysis on SAM2 reveals
that each level of adaptation creates a further representational bottleneck.
Our analysis illuminates these trade-offs in feature universality, providing a
quantitative foundation for designing efficient feature coding and adaptation
strategies for diverse downstream applications.

Abstract: Multimodal agents for computer use rely exclusively on primitive actions
(click, type, scroll) that require accurate visual grounding and lengthy
execution chains, leading to cascading failures and performance bottlenecks.
While other agents leverage rich programmatic interfaces (APIs, MCP servers,
tools), computer-use agents (CUAs) remain isolated from these capabilities. We
present UltraCUA, a foundation model that bridges this gap through hybrid
action -- seamlessly integrating GUI primitives with high-level programmatic
tool calls. To achieve this, our approach comprises four key components: (1) an
automated pipeline that scales programmatic tools from software documentation,
open-source repositories, and code generation; (2) a synthetic data engine
producing over 17,000 verifiable tasks spanning real-world computer-use
scenarios; (3) a large-scale high-quality hybrid action trajectory collection
with both low-level GUI actions and high-level programmatic tool calls; and (4)
a two-stage training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning with online
reinforcement learning, enabling strategic alternation between low-level and
high-level actions. Experiments with our 7B and 32B models demonstrate
substantial improvements over state-of-the-art agents. On OSWorld, UltraCUA
models achieve an average 22% relative improvement over base models, while
being 11% faster in terms of steps. Out-of-domain evaluation on
WindowsAgentArena shows our model reaches 21.7% success rate, outperforming
baselines trained on Windows data. The hybrid action mechanism proves critical,
reducing error propagation while maintaining execution efficiency.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) point clouds are becoming increasingly vital in
applications such as autonomous driving, augmented reality, and immersive
communication, demanding real-time processing and low latency. However, their
large data volumes and bandwidth constraints hinder the deployment of
high-quality services in resource-limited environments. Progres- sive coding,
which allows for decoding at varying levels of detail, provides an alternative
by allowing initial partial decoding with subsequent refinement. Although
recent learning-based point cloud geometry coding methods have achieved notable
success, their fixed latent representation does not support progressive
decoding. To bridge this gap, we propose ProDAT, a novel density-aware
tail-drop mechanism for progressive point cloud coding. By leveraging density
information as a guidance signal, latent features and coordinates are decoded
adaptively based on their significance, therefore achieving progressive
decoding at multiple bitrates using one single model. Experimental results on
benchmark datasets show that the proposed ProDAT not only enables progressive
coding but also achieves superior coding efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art learning-based coding techniques, with over 28.6% BD-rate
improvement for PSNR- D2 on SemanticKITTI and over 18.15% for ShapeNet

TL;DR: Glyph框架通过将长文本渲染为图像并用视觉语言模型处理，实现了3-4倍的文本压缩，在保持准确性的同时显著提升了长上下文处理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型对长上下文建模需求的增加，扩展到百万token级别会带来过高的计算和内存成本，限制了长上下文LLMs的实用性。

Method: 提出Glyph框架，将长文本渲染成图像，使用视觉语言模型处理；设计基于LLM的遗传搜索来寻找最佳视觉渲染配置，平衡准确性和压缩率。

Result: 在多个长上下文基准测试中，该方法实现了3-4倍的token压缩，准确性与Qwen3-8B等领先LLMs相当；预填充和解码速度提升约4倍，SFT训练速度提升约2倍；128K上下文的VLM可扩展到处理1M token级别的文本任务。

Conclusion: 视觉上下文扩展方法为长文本处理提供了高效解决方案，在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算成本，并为现实世界多模态任务带来益处。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on long-context modeling for
tasks such as document understanding, code analysis, and multi-step reasoning.
However, scaling context windows to the million-token level brings prohibitive
computational and memory costs, limiting the practicality of long-context LLMs.
In this work, we take a different perspective-visual context scaling-to tackle
this challenge. Instead of extending token-based sequences, we propose Glyph, a
framework that renders long texts into images and processes them with
vision-language models (VLMs). This approach substantially compresses textual
input while preserving semantic information, and we further design an
LLM-driven genetic search to identify optimal visual rendering configurations
for balancing accuracy and compression. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that our method achieves 3-4x token compression while maintaining
accuracy comparable to leading LLMs such as Qwen3-8B on various long-context
benchmarks. This compression also leads to around 4x faster prefilling and
decoding, and approximately 2x faster SFT training. Furthermore, under extreme
compression, a 128K-context VLM could scale to handle 1M-token-level text
tasks. In addition, the rendered text data benefits real-world multimodal
tasks, such as document understanding. Our code and model are released at
https://github.com/thu-coai/Glyph.

Motivation: 多模态目标检测在挑战性条件下通过利用多个传感器模态的互补线索来提高鲁棒性，但现有方法往往针对特定数据集设计，缺乏通用性。

Method: 提出FMCAF架构，包含频域滤波块(Freq-Filter)来抑制冗余频谱特征，以及基于跨注意力的融合模块(MCAF)来改善模态间特征共享。

Result: 在LLVIP(低光行人检测)和VEDAI(航空车辆检测)数据集上，FMCAF优于传统拼接融合方法，VEDAI上mAP@50提升13.9%，LLVIP上提升1.1%。

Conclusion: FMCAF作为一种灵活的预处理架构，为未来多模态检测管道中的鲁棒融合提供了潜力，具有较好的通用性。

Abstract: Multimodal object detection improves robustness in chal- lenging conditions
by leveraging complementary cues from multiple sensor modalities. We introduce
Filtered Multi- Modal Cross Attention Fusion (FMCAF), a preprocess- ing
architecture designed to enhance the fusion of RGB and infrared (IR) inputs.
FMCAF combines a frequency- domain filtering block (Freq-Filter) to suppress
redun- dant spectral features with a cross-attention-based fusion module (MCAF)
to improve intermodal feature sharing. Unlike approaches tailored to specific
datasets, FMCAF aims for generalizability, improving performance across
different multimodal challenges without requiring dataset- specific tuning. On
LLVIP (low-light pedestrian detec- tion) and VEDAI (aerial vehicle detection),
FMCAF outper- forms traditional fusion (concatenation), achieving +13.9% mAP@50
on VEDAI and +1.1% on LLVIP. These results support the potential of FMCAF as a
flexible foundation for robust multimodal fusion in future detection pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高斯泼溅方法在重建平面区域时存在平滑度和精度不足的问题，而平面是3D场景中的重要基元，特别是在人造环境中

Method: 利用现成的分割和法线预测模型提取平面先验，建立结构化平面高斯坐标表示；引入动态高斯重分类器自适应重新分类高梯度平面高斯；利用优化后的平面先验优化网格布局

Result: 在不牺牲渲染质量的前提下，显著提高了提取网格的几何精度，减少了顶点和面数，改善了拓扑结构

Conclusion: GSPlane通过平面先验的引入有效解决了高斯泼溅在平面重建中的问题，实现了更准确、结构化的3D场景重建

Abstract: Planes are fundamental primitives of 3D sences, especially in man-made
environments such as indoor spaces and urban streets. Representing these planes
in a structured and parameterized format facilitates scene editing and physical
simulations in downstream applications. Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has
demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in the Novel View Synthesis task, with
extensions showing great potential in accurate surface reconstruction. However,
even state-of-the-art GS representations often struggle to reconstruct planar
regions with sufficient smoothness and precision. To address this issue, we
propose GSPlane, which recovers accurate geometry and produces clean and
well-structured mesh connectivity for plane regions in the reconstructed scene.
By leveraging off-the-shelf segmentation and normal prediction models, GSPlane
extracts robust planar priors to establish structured representations for
planar Gaussian coordinates, which help guide the training process by enforcing
geometric consistency. To further enhance training robustness, a Dynamic
Gaussian Re-classifier is introduced to adaptively reclassify planar Gaussians
with persistently high gradients as non-planar, ensuring more reliable
optimization. Furthermore, we utilize the optimized planar priors to refine the
mesh layouts, significantly improving topological structure while reducing the
number of vertices and faces. We also explore applications of the structured
planar representation, which enable decoupling and flexible manipulation of
objects on supportive planes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, with no
sacrifice in rendering quality, the introduction of planar priors significantly
improves the geometric accuracy of the extracted meshes across various
baselines.

Motivation: 预训练扩散方法在低层视觉任务中表现出色，但往往牺牲内容保真度来获得更高的感知真实性，特别是在低光照场景下，严重退化的信息限制了有效控制。

Method: 引入潜在细化管道来恢复VAE编码过程中丢失的空间细节，并建立条件潜在与噪声潜在之间的动态双向交互机制。

Result: 广泛实验表明，该方法在预训练扩散方法中实现了显著的内容保真度提升。

Conclusion: 该优化策略是即插即用的，可以无缝集成到现有扩散网络中提供更有效的控制，在保持真实性和美学质量的同时增强保真度。

Abstract: Diffusion-based methods, leveraging pre-trained large models like Stable
Diffusion via ControlNet, have achieved remarkable performance in several
low-level vision tasks. However, Pre-Trained Diffusion-Based (PTDB) methods
often sacrifice content fidelity to attain higher perceptual realism. This
issue is exacerbated in low-light scenarios, where severely degraded
information caused by the darkness limits effective control. We identify two
primary causes of fidelity loss: the absence of suitable conditional latent
modeling and the lack of bidirectional interaction between the conditional
latent and noisy latent in the diffusion process. To address this, we propose a
novel optimization strategy for conditioning in pre-trained diffusion models,
enhancing fidelity while preserving realism and aesthetics. Our method
introduces a mechanism to recover spatial details lost during VAE encoding,
i.e., a latent refinement pipeline incorporating generative priors.
Additionally, the refined latent condition interacts dynamically with the noisy
latent, leading to improved restoration performance. Our approach is
plug-and-play, seamlessly integrating into existing diffusion networks to
provide more effective control. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant
fidelity improvements in PTDB methods.

Motivation: 为隐私保护和内容验证提供一种视觉不可感知的水印技术，利用LED照明和相机传感器的光谱特性差异来实现隐蔽的信息嵌入。

Method: 采用光谱调制而非强度调制，联合考虑人眼视觉系统敏感性、相机传感器光谱响应和窄带LED生成白光的特性，优化LED光谱轮廓以实现人眼不可见但相机可检测的水印。

Result: 能够在标准低帧率（30-60 fps）下提取水印，10秒视频片段可嵌入128位信息，足以支持隐私保护和内容验证所需的元数据。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了视觉不可感知的水印嵌入，为消费级相机环境下的隐私保护和内容验证提供了一种实用的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces a method for using LED-based environmental lighting to
produce visually imperceptible watermarks for consumer cameras. Our approach
optimizes an LED light source's spectral profile to be minimally visible to the
human eye while remaining highly detectable by typical consumer cameras. The
method jointly considers the human visual system's sensitivity to visible
spectra, modern consumer camera sensors' spectral sensitivity, and narrowband
LEDs' ability to generate broadband spectra perceived as "white light"
(specifically, D65 illumination). To ensure imperceptibility, we employ
spectral modulation rather than intensity modulation. Unlike conventional
visible light communication, our approach enables watermark extraction at
standard low frame rates (30-60 fps). While the information transfer rate is
modest-embedding 128 bits within a 10-second video clip-this capacity is
sufficient for essential metadata supporting privacy protection and content
verification.

Motivation: 现有方法通过扰动文本条件嵌入生成OOD样本，存在语义不稳定和偏移多样性不足的问题，限制了在真实OOD场景中的泛化能力

Method: 使用现成的ID分类器，结合图像级引导（基于对数分割梯度减少输入似然）和特征级引导（基于k-NN距离在分类器潜在空间中促进稀疏区域采样）的双重引导设计

Result: 训练使用GOOD生成的样本可以显著提升OOD检测性能

Conclusion: GOOD框架通过双重引导机制实现了更可控和多样化的OOD样本生成，增强了OOD检测的鲁棒性

Abstract: Recent advancements have explored text-to-image diffusion models for
synthesizing out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, substantially enhancing the
performance of OOD detection. However, existing approaches typically rely on
perturbing text-conditioned embeddings, resulting in semantic instability and
insufficient shift diversity, which limit generalization to realistic OOD. To
address these challenges, we propose GOOD, a novel and flexible framework that
directly guides diffusion sampling trajectories towards OOD regions using
off-the-shelf in-distribution (ID) classifiers. GOOD incorporates dual-level
guidance: (1) Image-level guidance based on the gradient of log partition to
reduce input likelihood, drives samples toward low-density regions in pixel
space. (2) Feature-level guidance, derived from k-NN distance in the
classifier's latent space, promotes sampling in feature-sparse regions. Hence,
this dual-guidance design enables more controllable and diverse OOD sample
generation. Additionally, we introduce a unified OOD score that adaptively
combines image and feature discrepancies, enhancing detection robustness. We
perform thorough quantitative and qualitative analyses to evaluate the
effectiveness of GOOD, demonstrating that training with samples generated by
GOOD can notably enhance OOD detection performance.

Motivation: 铰接物体（如笔记本电脑和抽屉）由于其多部件几何结构和可变关节配置，在3D重建和姿态估计方面存在显著挑战，这些结构在不同状态下表现出多样性。

Method: 首先通过运动学感知VAE将完整几何（SDF）、关节角度和部件分割编码到结构化潜在空间；然后使用两个条件扩散模型分别回归全局姿态（SE(3)）和关节参数，以及从部分观测生成运动学感知潜在代码；最后通过迭代优化模块双向优化重建精度和运动学参数。

Conclusion: 提出的KineDiff3D框架有效解决了铰接物体的3D重建和姿态估计问题，通过运动学感知的扩散模型实现了准确的重建和参数估计。

Abstract: Articulated objects, such as laptops and drawers, exhibit significant
challenges for 3D reconstruction and pose estimation due to their multi-part
geometries and variable joint configurations, which introduce structural
diversity across different states. To address these challenges, we propose
KineDiff3D: Kinematic-Aware Diffusion for Category-Level Articulated Object
Shape Reconstruction and Generation, a unified framework for reconstructing
diverse articulated instances and pose estimation from single view input.
Specifically, we first encode complete geometry (SDFs), joint angles, and part
segmentation into a structured latent space via a novel Kinematic-Aware VAE
(KA-VAE). In addition, we employ two conditional diffusion models: one for
regressing global pose (SE(3)) and joint parameters, and another for generating
the kinematic-aware latent code from partial observations. Finally, we produce
an iterative optimization module that bidirectionally refines reconstruction
accuracy and kinematic parameters via Chamfer-distance minimization while
preserving articulation constraints. Experimental results on synthetic,
semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in accurately reconstructing articulated objects and estimating their
kinematic properties.

Conclusion: GACO-CAD通过几何先验和简洁性奖励有效提升了从单图像生成CAD模型的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Generating editable, parametric CAD models from a single image holds great
potential to lower the barriers of industrial concept design. However, current
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with accurately
inferring 3D geometry from 2D images due to limited spatial reasoning
capabilities. We address this limitation by introducing GACO-CAD, a novel
two-stage post-training framework. It is designed to achieve a joint objective:
simultaneously improving the geometric accuracy of the generated CAD models and
encouraging the use of more concise modeling procedures. First, during
supervised fine-tuning, we leverage depth and surface normal maps as dense
geometric priors, combining them with the RGB image to form a multi-channel
input. In the context of single-view reconstruction, these priors provide
complementary spatial cues that help the MLLM more reliably recover 3D geometry
from 2D observations. Second, during reinforcement learning, we introduce a
group length reward that, while preserving high geometric fidelity, promotes
the generation of more compact and less redundant parametric modeling
sequences. A simple dynamic weighting strategy is adopted to stabilize
training. Experiments on the DeepCAD and Fusion360 datasets show that GACO-CAD
achieves state-of-the-art performance under the same MLLM backbone,
consistently outperforming existing methods in terms of code validity,
geometric accuracy, and modeling conciseness.

Result: 人脸检测模型的选择可使攻击成功率降低高达78%，而插值方法影响相对较小。预处理要求即使在白盒设置下也会降低攻击强度。提出的预处理不变方法可将攻击可迁移性提升高达27%。

Conclusion: 预处理在人脸识别系统中至关重要，需要考虑预处理因素来提高面部对抗样本的对抗泛化能力。

Abstract: Face Recognition (FR) models have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial
examples that subtly alter benign facial images, exposing blind spots in these
systems, as well as protecting user privacy. End-to-end FR systems first obtain
preprocessed faces from diverse facial imagery prior to computing the
similarity of the deep feature embeddings. Whilst face preprocessing is a
critical component of FR systems, and hence adversarial attacks against them,
we observe that this preprocessing is often overlooked in blackbox settings.
Our study seeks to investigate the transferability of several out-of-the-box
state-of-the-art adversarial attacks against FR when applied against different
preprocessing techniques used in a blackbox setting. We observe that the choice
of face detection model can degrade the attack success rate by up to 78%,
whereas choice of interpolation method during downsampling has relatively
minimal impacts. Furthermore, we find that the requirement for facial
preprocessing even degrades attack strength in a whitebox setting, due to the
unintended interaction of produced noise vectors against face detection models.
Based on these findings, we propose a preprocessing-invariant method using
input transformations that improves the transferability of the studied attacks
by up to 27%. Our findings highlight the importance of preprocessing in FR
systems, and the need for its consideration towards improving the adversarial
generalisation of facial adversarial examples.

Motivation: 解决MAR模型在并行生成视觉内容时，由于空间相关视觉标记的建模复杂性而导致的加速潜力受限问题。

Result: 在ImageNet类条件生成和文本到图像生成任务中，MAR-H模型实现3.72倍加速，同时保持可比质量(FID:1.59, IS:304.4 vs 原始1.59, 299.1)。

Conclusion: GtR方法显著优于现有加速方法，在不同模型规模和生成任务上均表现出色，为MAR模型提供了有效的加速解决方案。

Abstract: Masked Autoregressive (MAR) models promise better efficiency in visual
generation than autoregressive (AR) models for the ability of parallel
generation, yet their acceleration potential remains constrained by the
modeling complexity of spatially correlated visual tokens in a single step. To
address this limitation, we introduce Generation then Reconstruction (GtR), a
training-free hierarchical sampling strategy that decomposes generation into
two stages: structure generation establishing global semantic scaffolding,
followed by detail reconstruction efficiently completing remaining tokens.
Assuming that it is more difficult to create an image from scratch than to
complement images based on a basic image framework, GtR is designed to achieve
acceleration by computing the reconstruction stage quickly while maintaining
the generation quality by computing the generation stage slowly. Moreover,
observing that tokens on the details of an image often carry more semantic
information than tokens in the salient regions, we further propose
Frequency-Weighted Token Selection (FTS) to offer more computation budget to
tokens on image details, which are localized based on the energy of high
frequency information. Extensive experiments on ImageNet class-conditional and
text-to-image generation demonstrate 3.72x speedup on MAR-H while maintaining
comparable quality (e.g., FID: 1.59, IS: 304.4 vs. original 1.59, 299.1),
substantially outperforming existing acceleration methods across various model
scales and generation tasks. Our codes will be released in

Abstract: Automated plankton recognition models face significant challenges during
real-world deployment due to distribution shifts (Out-of-Distribution, OoD)
between training and test data. This stems from plankton's complex
morphologies, vast species diversity, and the continuous discovery of novel
species, which leads to unpredictable errors during inference. Despite rapid
advancements in OoD detection methods in recent years, the field of plankton
recognition still lacks a systematic integration of the latest computer vision
developments and a unified benchmark for large-scale evaluation. To address
this, this paper meticulously designed a series of OoD benchmarks simulating
various distribution shift scenarios based on the DYB-PlanktonNet dataset
\cite{875n-f104-21}, and systematically evaluated twenty-two OoD detection
methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the ViM
\cite{wang2022vim} method significantly outperforms other approaches in our
constructed benchmarks, particularly excelling in Far-OoD scenarios with
substantial improvements in key metrics. This comprehensive evaluation not only
provides a reliable reference for algorithm selection in automated plankton
recognition but also lays a solid foundation for future research in plankton
OoD detection. To our knowledge, this study marks the first large-scale,
systematic evaluation and analysis of Out-of-Distribution data detection
methods in plankton recognition. Code is available at

Abstract: Photorealistic 3D head avatars are vital for telepresence, gaming, and VR.
However, most methods focus solely on facial regions, ignoring natural
hand-face interactions, such as a hand resting on the chin or fingers gently
touching the cheek, which convey cognitive states like pondering. In this work,
we present a novel framework that jointly learns detailed head avatars and the
non-rigid deformations induced by hand-face interactions.
  There are two principal challenges in this task. First, naively tracking hand
and face separately fails to capture their relative poses. To overcome this, we
propose to combine depth order loss with contact regularization during pose
tracking, ensuring correct spatial relationships between the face and hand.
Second, no publicly available priors exist for hand-induced deformations,
making them non-trivial to learn from monocular videos. To address this, we
learn a PCA basis specific to hand-induced facial deformations from a face-hand
interaction dataset. This reduces the problem to estimating a compact set of
PCA parameters rather than a full spatial deformation field. Furthermore,
inspired by physics-based simulation, we incorporate a contact loss that
provides additional supervision, significantly reducing interpenetration
artifacts and enhancing the physical plausibility of the results.
  We evaluate our approach on RGB(D) videos captured by an iPhone.
Additionally, to better evaluate the reconstructed geometry, we construct a
synthetic dataset of avatars with various types of hand interactions. We show
that our method can capture better appearance and more accurate deforming
geometry of the face than SOTA surface reconstruction methods.

Result: 在PACS、Office-Home和DomainNet数据集上达到最先进水平，持续优于现有的欧几里得和双曲(DG)-GCD基线方法。

Conclusion: HIDISC通过双曲表示学习框架有效解决了领域和类别级别的泛化问题，避免了情景模拟的高计算成本，实现了高效且准确的跨领域类别发现。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify test-time samples into
either seen categories** -- available during training -- or novel ones, without
relying on label supervision. Most existing GCD methods assume simultaneous
access to labeled and unlabeled data during training and arising from the same
domain, limiting applicability in open-world scenarios involving distribution
shifts. Domain Generalization with GCD (DG-GCD) lifts this constraint by
requiring models to generalize to unseen domains containing novel categories,
without accessing targetdomain data during training. The only prior DG-GCD
method, DG2CD-Net, relies on episodic training with multiple synthetic domains
and task vector aggregation, incurring high computational cost and error
accumulation. We propose HIDISC, a hyperbolic representation learning framework
that achieves domain and category-level generalization without episodic
simulation. To expose the model to minimal but diverse domain variations, we
augment the source domain using GPT-guided diffusion, avoiding overfitting
while maintaining efficiency. To structure the representation space, we
introduce Tangent CutMix, a curvature-aware interpolation that synthesizes
pseudo-novel samples in tangent space, preserving manifold consistency. A
unified loss -- combining penalized Busemann alignment, hybrid hyperbolic
contrastive regularization, and adaptive outlier repulsion -- **facilitates
compact, semantically structured embeddings. A learnable curvature parameter
further adapts the geometry to dataset complexity. HIDISC achieves
state-of-the-art results on PACS , Office-Home , and DomainNet, consistently
outperforming the existing Euclidean and hyperbolic (DG)-GCD baselines.

*Pu Zhang,Yuwei Li,Xingyuan Xian,Guoming Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种零样本的视觉token剪枝方法，通过平衡任务相关性和信息多样性，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型处理能力增强，视觉token冗余导致推理成本过高，现有方法缺乏文本提示的指导，无法优先考虑任务相关性

Method: 分层方法：先选择任务相关的核心视觉token，再补充多样性token以保留更广泛上下文

Result: 在多个模型和基准测试中，即使剪枝90%的token也能达到或超越最先进方法，仅造成最小精度损失，同时显著减少GPU内存占用和推理延迟

Conclusion: 提出的提示感知视觉token剪枝方法在保持性能的同时有效降低计算成本，为大规模视觉语言模型的高效推理提供了可行方案

Abstract: As the capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) advance, they can
process increasingly large inputs, which, unlike in LLMs, generates significant
visual token redundancy and leads to prohibitive inference costs. While many
methods aim to reduce these costs by pruning visual tokens, existing
approaches, whether based on attention or diversity, typically neglect the
guidance of the text prompt and thus fail to prioritize task relevance. In this
work, we propose a novel, zero-shot method that reframes the problem by
introducing a prompt-aware perspective, explicitly modeling visual token
pruning as a balance between task relevance and information diversity. Our
hierarchical approach first selects a core set of task-relevant visual tokens
and then supplements them with diversity tokens to preserve broader context.
Experiments across multiple models and benchmarks show that our method achieves
performance that matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art with only minimal
accuracy loss, even when pruning up to 90\% of the tokens. Furthermore, these
gains are accompanied by significant reductions in GPU memory footprint and
inference latency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用Segment Anything Model (SAM)开发了一个专门用于监测孟加拉国河流侵蚀的AI模型，通过微调SAM的掩码解码器来识别河岸侵蚀的细微特征，在土地-水体分割任务上取得了86.30%的mIoU和92.60%的Dice分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉国的主要河流既是商业和生存的动脉，也是无情的破坏者，每年吞噬整个村庄和大片农田，导致数千家庭流离失所。传统的人工分析方法难以有效跟踪这种缓慢发生的灾难。

Method: 首先使用简单的颜色通道分析进行粗略的土地-水体分割，然后微调SAM的掩码解码器来识别河岸侵蚀的细微特征。构建了包含2003-2025年孟加拉国最脆弱地区历史Google Earth影像的新数据集，这是首个包含消失定居点手动标注的数据集。

Result: 开发的模型在识别河流侵蚀破坏过程方面表现出色，平均交并比达到86.30%，Dice分数达到92.60%，性能显著优于传统方法和现成的深度学习模型。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了三个关键贡献：孟加拉国因河流侵蚀而消失定居点的首个标注数据集；专门为此关键任务微调的AI模型；以及通过引人注目的视觉证据量化土地损失的方法。这些工具为政策制定者和灾害管理机构监控侵蚀、预测其轨迹并保护脆弱社区提供了强大的新视角。

Abstract: The great rivers of Bangladesh, arteries of commerce and sustenance, are also
agents of relentless destruction. Each year, they swallow whole villages and
vast tracts of farmland, erasing communities from the map and displacing
thousands of families. To track this slow-motion catastrophe has, until now,
been a Herculean task for human analysts. Here we show how a powerful
general-purpose vision model, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), can be adapted
to this task with remarkable precision. To do this, we assembled a new dataset
- a digital chronicle of loss compiled from historical Google Earth imagery of
Bangladesh's most vulnerable regions, including Mokterer Char Union, Kedarpur
Union, Balchipara village, and Chowhali Upazila, from 2003 to 2025. Crucially,
this dataset is the first to include manually annotated data on the settlements
that have vanished beneath the water. Our method first uses a simple
color-channel analysis to provide a rough segmentation of land and water, and
then fine-tunes SAM's mask decoder to recognize the subtle signatures of
riverbank erosion. The resulting model demonstrates a keen eye for this
destructive process, achieving a mean Intersection over Union of 86.30% and a
Dice score of 92.60% - a performance that significantly surpasses traditional
methods and off-the-shelf deep learning models. This work delivers three key
contributions: the first annotated dataset of disappeared settlements in
Bangladesh due to river erosion; a specialized AI model fine-tuned for this
critical task; and a method for quantifying land loss with compelling visual
evidence. Together, these tools provide a powerful new lens through which
policymakers and disaster management agencies can monitor erosion, anticipate
its trajectory, and ultimately protect the vulnerable communities in its path.

TL;DR: 基于TimeSformer视频识别模型，通过分析VALORANT比赛录像中的小地图信息，提取战术特征来预测回合结果，在增强战术标签的数据集上达到约81%的预测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电竞比赛结果预测研究多基于比赛日志数据和统计信息，本研究针对需要复杂策略的FPS游戏VALORANT，旨在通过分析比赛录像中的小地图信息来构建回合结果预测模型。

Method: 基于TimeSformer视频识别模型，从小地图信息中提取详细的战术特征，包括角色位置信息和其他游戏内事件，构建增强战术标签的数据集进行训练。

Result: 在增强战术标签的数据集上训练的模型达到约81%的预测准确率，特别是在回合中期阶段表现显著优于仅基于小地图信息本身训练的模型。

Conclusion: 利用比赛录像中的战术特征对于预测VALORANT回合结果非常有效，证明了战术分析在电竞预测中的重要性。

Abstract: Recently, research on predicting match outcomes in esports has been actively
conducted, but much of it is based on match log data and statistical
information. This research targets the FPS game VALORANT, which requires
complex strategies, and aims to build a round outcome prediction model by
analyzing minimap information in match footage. Specifically, based on the
video recognition model TimeSformer, we attempt to improve prediction accuracy
by incorporating detailed tactical features extracted from minimap information,
such as character position information and other in-game events. This paper
reports preliminary results showing that a model trained on a dataset augmented
with such tactical event labels achieved approximately 81% prediction accuracy,
especially from the middle phases of a round onward, significantly
outperforming a model trained on a dataset with the minimap information itself.
This suggests that leveraging tactical features from match footage is highly
effective for predicting round outcomes in VALORANT.

TL;DR: EndoCIL是一个专门为内窥镜图像诊断设计的类增量学习框架，通过三个关键组件解决领域差异和类别不平衡问题，在多个数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内窥镜图像分析需要模型能够持续适应新的临床数据，同时保持对已学知识的性能。现有重放方法由于内窥镜图像中严重的领域差异和类别不平衡，无法有效缓解灾难性遗忘。

Method: EndoCIL包含三个核心组件：基于最大均值差异的重放(MDBR)选择多样代表性样本，先验正则化类别平衡损失(PRCBL)缓解类别不平衡，全连接梯度校准(CFG)调整分类器梯度减少新类偏差。

Result: 在四个公共内窥镜数据集上的广泛实验表明，EndoCIL在不同缓冲区大小和评估指标下普遍优于最先进的CIL方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效平衡了终身内窥镜诊断中的稳定性和可塑性，显示出良好的临床可扩展性和部署潜力。

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) for endoscopic image analysis is crucial for
real-world clinical applications, where diagnostic models should continuously
adapt to evolving clinical data while retaining performance on previously
learned ones. However, existing replay-based CIL methods fail to effectively
mitigate catastrophic forgetting due to severe domain discrepancies and class
imbalance inherent in endoscopic imaging. To tackle these challenges, we
propose EndoCIL, a novel and unified CIL framework specifically tailored for
endoscopic image diagnosis. EndoCIL incorporates three key components: Maximum
Mean Discrepancy Based Replay (MDBR), employing a distribution-aligned greedy
strategy to select diverse and representative exemplars, Prior Regularized
Class Balanced Loss (PRCBL), designed to alleviate both inter-phase and
intra-phase class imbalance by integrating prior class distributions and
balance weights into the loss function, and Calibration of Fully-Connected
Gradients (CFG), which adjusts the classifier gradients to mitigate bias toward
new classes. Extensive experiments conducted on four public endoscopic datasets
demonstrate that EndoCIL generally outperforms state-of-the-art CIL methods
across varying buffer sizes and evaluation metrics. The proposed framework
effectively balances stability and plasticity in lifelong endoscopic diagnosis,
showing promising potential for clinical scalability and deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸识别系统虽然对姿态、光照和模糊具有鲁棒性，但恶意攻击者可能使用注册用户的照片绕过认证。需要在人脸识别前检测这种欺骗攻击。

Method: 使用带有寄存器的DINOv2模型提取可泛化特征，抑制注意力机制中的扰动，使模型能够专注于关键细微特征来区分真实和伪造人脸图像。

Result: 在The 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Workshop数据集和SiW数据集上进行了实验，证明了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于DINOv2的欺骗攻击检测方法能够有效识别真实和伪造人脸图像之间的细微差异，提高人脸识别系统的安全性。

Abstract: Face recognition systems are designed to be robust against variations in head
pose, illumination, and image blur during capture. However, malicious actors
can exploit these systems by presenting a face photo of a registered user,
potentially bypassing the authentication process. Such spoofing attacks must be
detected prior to face recognition. In this paper, we propose a DINOv2-based
spoofing attack detection method to discern minute differences between live and
spoofed face images. Specifically, we employ DINOv2 with registers to extract
generalizable features and to suppress perturbations in the attention
mechanism, which enables focused attention on essential and minute features. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments
conducted on the dataset provided by ``The 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Workshop:
Unified Physical-Digital Attacks Detection@ICCV2025'' and SiW dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时刻检索方法专注于单时刻检索，但现实应用中一个查询可能对应多个相关时刻，现有数据集和方法不足以支持视频时序定位。

Method: 提出FlashMMR框架，包含多时刻后验证模块，通过约束时序调整和验证模块重新评估候选片段，过滤低置信度提案实现鲁棒的多时刻对齐。

Result: 在QV-M²数据集上，FlashMMR相比之前SOTA方法在G-mAP、mAP@3+tgt和mR@3指标上分别提升3.00%、2.70%和2.56%。

Conclusion: QV-M²数据集和FlashMMR方法为推进更现实和具有挑战性的视频时序定位研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Existing Moment retrieval (MR) methods focus on Single-Moment Retrieval
(SMR). However, one query can correspond to multiple relevant moments in
real-world applications. This makes the existing datasets and methods
insufficient for video temporal grounding. By revisiting the gap between
current MR tasks and real-world applications, we introduce a high-quality
datasets called QVHighlights Multi-Moment Dataset (QV-M$^2$), along with new
evaluation metrics tailored for multi-moment retrieval (MMR). QV-M$^2$ consists
of 2,212 annotations covering 6,384 video segments. Building on existing
efforts in MMR, we propose a framework called FlashMMR. Specifically, we
propose a Multi-moment Post-verification module to refine the moment
boundaries. We introduce constrained temporal adjustment and subsequently
leverage a verification module to re-evaluate the candidate segments. Through
this sophisticated filtering pipeline, low-confidence proposals are pruned, and
robust multi-moment alignment is achieved. We retrain and evaluate 6 existing
MR methods on QV-M$^2$ and QVHighlights under both SMR and MMR settings.
Results show that QV-M$^2$ serves as an effective benchmark for training and
evaluating MMR models, while FlashMMR provides a strong baseline. Specifically,
on QV-M$^2$, it achieves improvements over prior SOTA method by 3.00% on G-mAP,
2.70% on mAP@3+tgt, and 2.56% on mR@3. The proposed benchmark and method
establish a foundation for advancing research in more realistic and challenging
video temporal grounding scenarios. Code is released at

Conclusion: 所提方法在公平性和准确性方面优于现有技术，为深度伪造检测提供了更可靠和可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection methods often exhibit bias, lack transparency,
and fail to capture temporal information, leading to biased decisions and
unreliable results across different demographic groups. In this paper, we
propose a fairness-aware deepfake detection framework that integrates temporal
feature learning and demographic-aware data augmentation to enhance fairness
and interpretability. Our method leverages sequence-based clustering for
temporal modeling of deepfake videos and concept extraction to improve
detection reliability while also facilitating interpretable decisions for
non-expert users. Additionally, we introduce a demography-aware data
augmentation method that balances underrepresented groups and applies
frequency-domain transformations to preserve deepfake artifacts, thereby
mitigating bias and improving generalization. Extensive experiments on
FaceForensics++, DFD, Celeb-DF, and DFDC datasets using state-of-the-art (SoTA)
architectures (Xception, ResNet) demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
method in obtaining the best tradeoff between fairness and accuracy when
compared to SoTA.

Abstract: The advancement of vision-language models (VLMs) is hampered by a fragmented
landscape of inconsistent and contaminated public datasets. We introduce
FineVision, a meticulously collected, curated, and unified corpus of 24 million
samples - the largest open resource of its kind. We unify more than 200 sources
into 185 subsets via a semi-automated, human-in-the-loop pipeline: automation
performs bulk ingestion and schema mapping, while reviewers audit mappings and
spot-check outputs to verify faithful consumption of annotations, appropriate
formatting and diversity, and safety; issues trigger targeted fixes and
re-runs. The workflow further applies rigorous de-duplication within and across
sources and decontamination against 66 public benchmarks. FineVision also
encompasses agentic/GUI tasks with a unified action space; reviewers validate
schemas and inspect a sample of trajectories to confirm executable fidelity.
Models trained on FineVision consistently outperform those trained on existing
open mixtures across a broad evaluation suite, underscoring the benefits of
scale, data hygiene, and balanced automation with human oversight. We release
the corpus and curation tools to accelerate data-centric VLM research.

Result: 在Waymo Open Motion Dataset和nuScenes Dataset上验证，两个最先进的运动预测模型均获得一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: PnF方法通过MLLMs的自然语言能力有效提升运动预测性能，具有实用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Current autonomous driving systems rely on specialized models for perceiving
and predicting motion, which demonstrate reliable performance in standard
conditions. However, generalizing cost-effectively to diverse real-world
scenarios remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose
Plug-and-Forecast (PnF), a plug-and-play approach that augments existing motion
forecasting models with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). PnF builds on
the insight that natural language provides a more effective way to describe and
handle complex scenarios, enabling quick adaptation to targeted behaviors. We
design prompts to extract structured scene understanding from MLLMs and distill
this information into learnable embeddings to augment existing behavior
prediction models. Our method leverages the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of
MLLMs to achieve significant improvements in motion prediction performance,
while requiring no fine-tuning -- making it practical to adopt. We validate our
approach on two state-of-the-art motion forecasting models using the Waymo Open
Motion Dataset and the nuScenes Dataset, demonstrating consistent performance
improvements across both benchmarks.

Conclusion: SG-CLDFF为临床工作流程提供了实用且可解释的白细胞自动分析路径

Abstract: Accurate segmentation and classification of white blood cells (WBCs) in
microscopic images are essential for diagnosis and monitoring of many
hematological disorders, yet remain challenging due to staining variability,
complex backgrounds, and class imbalance. In this paper, we introduce a novel
Saliency-Guided Cross-Layer Deep Feature Fusion framework (SG-CLDFF) that
tightly integrates saliency-driven preprocessing with multi-scale deep feature
aggregation to improve both robustness and interpretability for WBC analysis.
SG-CLDFF first computes saliency priors to highlight candidate WBC regions and
guide subsequent feature extraction. A lightweight hybrid backbone
(EfficientSwin-style) produces multi-resolution representations, which are
fused by a ResNeXt-CC-inspired cross-layer fusion module to preserve
complementary information from shallow and deep layers. The network is trained
in a multi-task setup with concurrent segmentation and cell-type classification
heads, using class-aware weighted losses and saliency-alignment regularization
to mitigate imbalance and suppress background activation. Interpretability is
enforced through Grad-CAM visualizations and saliency consistency checks,
allowing model decisions to be inspected at the regional level. We validate the
framework on standard public benchmarks (BCCD, LISC, ALL-IDB), reporting
consistent gains in IoU, F1, and classification accuracy compared to strong CNN
and transformer baselines. An ablation study also demonstrates the individual
contributions of saliency preprocessing and cross-layer fusion. SG-CLDFF offers
a practical and explainable path toward more reliable automated WBC analysis in
clinical workflows.

Conclusion: 该机器视觉解决方案自动化了照明过程，减轻了外科医生的身体负担，提高了照明一致性，有助于改善手术效果。

Abstract: Effortless and ergonomically designed surgical lighting is critical for
precision and safety during procedures. However, traditional systems often rely
on manual adjustments, leading to surgeon fatigue, neck strain, and
inconsistent illumination due to drift and shadowing. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel surgical lighting system that leverages the
YOLOv11 object detection algorithm to identify a blue marker placed above the
target surgical site. A high-power LED light source is then directed to the
identified location using two servomotors equipped with tilt-pan brackets. The
YOLO model achieves 96.7% mAP@50 on the validation set consisting of annotated
images simulating surgical scenes with the blue spherical marker. By automating
the lighting process, this machine vision-based solution reduces physical
strain on surgeons, improves consistency in illumination, and supports improved
surgical outcomes.

TL;DR: 论文发现自监督学习中的反直觉现象：训练时间过长会损害密集预测任务性能，称为自监督密集退化(SDD)。作者提出了DSE指标来无监督评估密集表示质量，并基于此开发了模型选择策略和正则化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到自监督学习中训练时间过长反而会损害密集预测任务性能的反直觉现象，需要解决无监督条件下评估密集表示质量的挑战。

Method: 提出了Dense representation Structure Estimator (DSE)，包含类别相关性度量和有效维度度量，基于此开发了模型选择策略和DSE正则化方法。

Result: 在16种自监督方法和4个基准测试上的实验表明，模型选择策略平均提升mIoU 3.0%，DSE正则化能持续缓解密集退化效应。

Conclusion: DSE指标能有效评估密集表示质量，基于DSE的模型选择和正则化方法能显著改善自监督学习在密集预测任务上的性能。

Abstract: In this work, we observe a counterintuitive phenomenon in self-supervised
learning (SSL): longer training may impair the performance of dense prediction
tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation). We refer to this phenomenon as
Self-supervised Dense Degradation (SDD) and demonstrate its consistent presence
across sixteen state-of-the-art SSL methods with various losses, architectures,
and datasets. When the model performs suboptimally on dense tasks at the end of
training, measuring the performance during training becomes essential. However,
evaluating dense performance effectively without annotations remains an open
challenge. To tackle this issue, we introduce a Dense representation Structure
Estimator (DSE), composed of a class-relevance measure and an effective
dimensionality measure. The proposed DSE is both theoretically grounded and
empirically validated to be closely correlated with the downstream performance.
Based on this metric, we introduce a straightforward yet effective model
selection strategy and a DSE-based regularization method. Experiments on
sixteen SSL methods across four benchmarks confirm that model selection
improves mIoU by $3.0\%$ on average with negligible computational cost.
Additionally, DSE regularization consistently mitigates the effects of dense
degradation. Code is available at

### [238] [CausalMamba: Scalable Conditional State Space Models for Neural Causal Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17318)
*Sangyoon Bae,Jiook Cha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CausalMamba是一个可扩展的fMRI因果推断框架，通过BOLD去卷积和条件Mamba架构解决神经因果推断的逆问题，在模拟数据上比DCM准确率高37%，在真实数据中能恢复88%的已知神经通路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决fMRI因果推断中的两个基本限制：从血流动力学扭曲的BOLD信号推断神经因果关系的病态性，以及现有方法（如DCM）的计算不可行性。

Method: 将复杂逆问题分解为两个可处理阶段：BOLD去卷积恢复潜在神经活动，然后使用新颖的条件Mamba架构进行因果图推断。

Result: 在模拟数据上比DCM准确率高37%；在真实任务fMRI数据中恢复88%的已知神经通路，而传统方法在99%以上受试者中无法识别这些典型回路；工作记忆数据分析显示大脑根据刺激策略性地转移主要因果枢纽。

Conclusion: 为神经科学家提供了一个实用的工具，用于大规模因果推断，捕捉认知功能背后的基本回路模式和灵活网络动态。

Abstract: We introduce CausalMamba, a scalable framework that addresses fundamental
limitations in fMRI-based causal inference: the ill-posed nature of inferring
neural causality from hemodynamically distorted BOLD signals and the
computational intractability of existing methods like Dynamic Causal Modeling
(DCM). Our approach decomposes this complex inverse problem into two tractable
stages: BOLD deconvolution to recover latent neural activity, followed by
causal graph inference using a novel Conditional Mamba architecture. On
simulated data, CausalMamba achieves 37% higher accuracy than DCM. Critically,
when applied to real task fMRI data, our method recovers well-established
neural pathways with 88% fidelity, whereas conventional approaches fail to
identify these canonical circuits in over 99% of subjects. Furthermore, our
network analysis of working memory data reveals that the brain strategically
shifts its primary causal hub-recruiting executive or salience networks
depending on the stimulus-a sophisticated reconfiguration that remains
undetected by traditional methods. This work provides neuroscientists with a
practical tool for large-scale causal inference that captures both fundamental
circuit motifs and flexible network dynamics underlying cognitive function.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文评估了现有对抗防御方法在面对大尺寸对抗衣物攻击时的脆弱性，发现单纯增大补丁尺寸就能使现有防御失效，对抗衣物在数字和物理世界都能有效突破多种防御方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实验发现简单增大对抗补丁尺寸就能使现有防御方法失效，因此需要评估防御方法在面对大尺寸对抗衣物时的表现，对抗衣物不仅尺寸大且比人体上的大补丁看起来更自然。

Method: 通过制作对抗衣物来测试多种防御方法，在数字世界和物理世界进行实验评估，特别针对Faster R-CNN制作了能突破多种防御的单套衣物。

Result: 所有防御方法在面对对抗衣物时表现都很差，制作的单套衣物在物理世界对未防御检测器的攻击成功率达96.06%，对九个防御模型的攻击成功率均超过64.84%。

Conclusion: 现有对抗防御方法在面对对抗衣物时存在共同脆弱性，大尺寸的对抗衣物能有效突破多种防御机制。

Abstract: In recent years, adversarial attacks against deep learning-based object
detectors in the physical world have attracted much attention. To defend
against these attacks, researchers have proposed various defense methods
against adversarial patches, a typical form of physically-realizable attack.
However, our experiments showed that simply enlarging the patch size could make
these defense methods fail. Motivated by this, we evaluated various defense
methods against adversarial clothes which have large coverage over the human
body. Adversarial clothes provide a good test case for adversarial defense
against patch-based attacks because they not only have large sizes but also
look more natural than a large patch on humans. Experiments show that all the
defense methods had poor performance against adversarial clothes in both the
digital world and the physical world. In addition, we crafted a single set of
clothes that broke multiple defense methods on Faster R-CNN. The set achieved
an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 96.06% against the undefended detector and over
64.84% ASRs against nine defended models in the physical world, unveiling the
common vulnerability of existing adversarial defense methods against
adversarial clothes. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出CharDiff框架，使用字符级引导的扩散模型来恢复和识别严重退化的车牌图像，在恢复质量和识别准确率上显著优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车牌图像恢复不仅对车牌识别系统预处理很重要，还能提高证据价值、增强视觉界面清晰度，促进车牌图像的进一步利用。

Method: CharDiff利用外部分割和OCR模块提取细粒度字符级先验，通过新颖的CHARM模块实现字符引导注意力，确保每个字符的引导仅限于自身区域。

Result: 在Roboflow-LP数据集上，相比性能最佳的基线模型，CharDiff实现了28%的相对CER降低，在恢复质量和识别准确率上显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 结构化字符引导条件化有效增强了基于扩散的车牌恢复和识别在实际部署场景中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The significance of license plate image restoration goes beyond the
preprocessing stage of License Plate Recognition (LPR) systems, as it also
serves various purposes, including increasing evidential value, enhancing the
clarity of visual interface, and facilitating further utilization of license
plate images. We propose a novel diffusion-based framework with character-level
guidance, CharDiff, which effectively restores and recognizes severely degraded
license plate images captured under realistic conditions. CharDiff leverages
fine-grained character-level priors extracted through external segmentation and
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) modules tailored for low-quality license
plate images. For precise and focused guidance, CharDiff incorporates a novel
Character-guided Attention through Region-wise Masking (CHARM) module, which
ensures that each character's guidance is restricted to its own region, thereby
avoiding interference with other regions. In experiments, CharDiff
significantly outperformed the baseline restoration models in both restoration
quality and recognition accuracy, achieving a 28% relative reduction in CER on
the Roboflow-LP dataset, compared to the best-performing baseline model. These
results indicate that the structured character-guided conditioning effectively
enhances the robustness of diffusion-based license plate restoration and
recognition in practical deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) has progressed from scalar quality prediction
to more interpretable, human-aligned evaluation paradigms. In this work, we
address the emerging challenge of detailed and explainable IQA by proposing
iDETEX-a unified multimodal large language model (MLLM) capable of
simultaneously performing three key tasks: quality grounding, perception, and
description. To facilitate efficient and generalizable training across these
heterogeneous subtasks, we design a suite of task-specific offline augmentation
modules and a data mixing strategy. These are further complemented by online
enhancement strategies to fully exploit multi-sourced supervision. We validate
our approach on the large-scale ViDA-UGC benchmark, where iDETEX achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all subtasks. Our model ranks first in the
ICCV MIPI 2025 Detailed Image Quality Assessment Challenge, demonstrating its
effectiveness and robustness in delivering accurate and interpretable quality
assessments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种后处理开放集识别方法，通过比较模型特征与预测logits之间的一致性来识别未知类别，无需重新训练预训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前野生动物分类模型在封闭世界设置下训练，当遇到未知类别时会过度自信。现有OSR方法大多需要重新训练模型，这限制了实际应用。

Method: 基于输入到最近类均值的距离构建概率分布，然后将该分布与softmax概率进行比较，衡量NCM和分类头之间的一致性。

Result: 在两个数据集上均排名前三，AUROC分别达到93.41（非洲动物）和95.35（瑞典动物），性能稳定优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的后处理OSR方法在多个数据集上表现一致且优异，无需重新训练模型，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art Wildlife classification models are trained under the
closed world setting. When exposed to unknown classes, they remain
overconfident in their predictions. Open-set Recognition (OSR) aims to classify
known classes while rejecting unknown samples. Several OSR methods have been
proposed to model the closed-set distribution by observing the feature, logit,
or softmax probability space. A significant drawback of many existing
approaches is the requirement to retrain the pre-trained classification model
with the OSR-specific strategy. This study contributes a post-processing OSR
method that measures the agreement between the models' features and predicted
logits. We propose a probability distribution based on an input's distance to
its Nearest Class Mean (NCM). The NCM-based distribution is then compared with
the softmax probabilities from the logit space to measure agreement between the
NCM and the classification head. Our proposed strategy ranks within the top
three on two evaluated datasets, showing consistent performance across the two
datasets. In contrast, current state-of-the-art methods excel on a single
dataset. We achieve an AUROC of 93.41 and 95.35 for African and Swedish
animals. The code can be found

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机只捕捉强度变化，忽略静态物体和背景，导致捕获的事件模态缺乏语义信息。现有E2V方法往往忽视语义信息在视频重建中的重要作用。

Method: 提出跨模态特征对齐模块将SAM模型的视觉语义转移到事件编码器；设计语义感知特征融合块整合学习到的语义特征；引入语义感知E2V监督利用SAM生成的类别标签。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提升帧质量，优于最先进的E2V方法。

Conclusion: 通过引入视觉语义知识，Semantic-E2VID有效解决了事件模态缺乏语义信息的问题，显著改善了事件到视频的重建质量。

Abstract: Event cameras offer distinct advantages such as low latency, high dynamic
range, and efficient motion capture. However, event-to-video reconstruction
(E2V), a fundamental event-based vision task, remains challenging, particularly
for reconstructing and recovering semantic information. This is primarily due
to the nature of the event camera, as it only captures intensity changes,
ignoring static objects and backgrounds, resulting in a lack of semantic
information in captured event modality. Further, semantic information plays a
crucial role in video and frame reconstruction, yet is often overlooked by
existing E2V approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose Semantic-E2VID, an E2V
framework that explores the missing visual semantic knowledge in event modality
and leverages it to enhance event-to-video reconstruction. Specifically,
Semantic-E2VID introduces a cross-modal feature alignment (CFA) module to
transfer the robust visual semantics from a frame-based vision foundation
model, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), to the event encoder, while aligning
the high-level features from distinct modalities. To better utilize the learned
semantic feature, we further propose a semantic-aware feature fusion (SFF)
block to integrate learned semantics in frame modality to form event
representations with rich semantics that can be decoded by the event decoder.
Further, to facilitate the reconstruction of semantic information, we propose a
novel Semantic Perceptual E2V Supervision that helps the model to reconstruct
semantic details by leveraging SAM-generated categorical labels. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Semantic-E2VID significantly enhances frame
quality, outperforming state-of-the-art E2V methods across multiple benchmarks.
The sample code is included in the supplementary material.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M2H是一个用于单目图像多任务学习的轻量级框架，支持语义分割、深度、边缘和表面法线估计，通过跨任务注意力模块实现高效特征交换，在保持计算效率的同时提升各任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在边缘设备上部署实时空间感知需要高效的多任务模型，既要利用互补任务信息，又要最小化计算开销。传统独立单任务模型或共享编码器-解码器架构无法同时满足这些需求。

Method: 提出Window-Based Cross-Task Attention Module实现结构化特征交换，同时保留任务特定细节；基于轻量级ViT-based DINOv2骨干网络，优化实时部署。

Result: 在NYUDv2数据集上超越最先进的多任务模型，在Hypersim上超过单任务深度和语义基线，在Cityscapes上表现优异，同时在笔记本电脑硬件上保持计算效率。

Conclusion: M2H为动态环境中的3D场景图构建提供了实用的单目空间感知系统基础，在真实世界数据上验证了其实用性。

Abstract: Deploying real-time spatial perception on edge devices requires efficient
multi-task models that leverage complementary task information while minimizing
computational overhead. This paper introduces Multi-Mono-Hydra (M2H), a novel
multi-task learning framework designed for semantic segmentation and depth,
edge, and surface normal estimation from a single monocular image. Unlike
conventional approaches that rely on independent single-task models or shared
encoder-decoder architectures, M2H introduces a Window-Based Cross-Task
Attention Module that enables structured feature exchange while preserving
task-specific details, improving prediction consistency across tasks. Built on
a lightweight ViT-based DINOv2 backbone, M2H is optimized for real-time
deployment and serves as the foundation for monocular spatial perception
systems supporting 3D scene graph construction in dynamic environments.
Comprehensive evaluations show that M2H outperforms state-of-the-art multi-task
models on NYUDv2, surpasses single-task depth and semantic baselines on
Hypersim, and achieves superior performance on the Cityscapes dataset, all
while maintaining computational efficiency on laptop hardware. Beyond
benchmarks, M2H is validated on real-world data, demonstrating its practicality
in spatial perception tasks.

Result: 在流式视频基准测试中达到最先进性能，在效率和效果之间取得良好平衡，性能损失最小。

Conclusion: 该方法为视频流处理提供了一种高效且有效的解决方案，无需额外训练即可与标准Video-LLMs兼容。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) excel at understanding videos
in-context, provided they have full access to the video when answering queries.
However, these models face challenges in streaming scenarios where hour-long
videos must be processed online, and questions need timely responses. In this
work, we propose a training-free approach compatible with standard Video-LLMs,
leveraging three key concepts: 1) LLM-informed selection of visual tokens to
identify those that the LLM has attended to and contributed to its
understanding of each short clip. Our attention-based selection allows us to
discard up to ~95% of unimportant visual tokens with minimal performance loss;
2) Recurrent processing of past selected tokens to generate temporally coherent
understanding of each processed clip; 3) Caption-based question answering for
lightweight and accurate responses. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on streaming video benchmarks, striking a balance between
efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: The deployment of facial recognition systems has created an ethical dilemma:
achieving high accuracy requires massive datasets of real faces collected
without consent, leading to dataset retractions and potential legal liabilities
under regulations like GDPR. While synthetic facial data presents a promising
privacy-preserving alternative, the field lacks comprehensive empirical
evidence of its viability. This study addresses this critical gap through
extensive evaluation of synthetic facial recognition datasets. We present a
systematic literature review identifying 25 synthetic facial recognition
datasets (2018-2025), combined with rigorous experimental validation. Our
methodology examines seven key requirements for privacy-preserving synthetic
data: identity leakage prevention, intra-class variability, identity
separability, dataset scale, ethical data sourcing, bias mitigation, and
benchmark reliability. Through experiments involving over 10 million synthetic
samples, extended by a comparison of results reported on five standard
benchmarks, we provide the first comprehensive empirical assessment of
synthetic data's capability to replace real datasets. Best-performing synthetic
datasets (VariFace, VIGFace) achieve recognition accuracies of 95.67% and
94.91% respectively, surpassing established real datasets including
CASIA-WebFace (94.70%). While those images remain private, publicly available
alternatives Vec2Face (93.52%) and CemiFace (93.22%) come close behind. Our
findings reveal that they ensure proper intra-class variability while
maintaining identity separability. Demographic bias analysis shows that, even
though synthetic data inherits limited biases, it offers unprecedented control
for bias mitigation through generation parameters. These results establish
synthetic facial data as a scientifically viable and ethically imperative
alternative for facial recognition research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于面部表情的PD诊断方法依赖单一表情类型易导致误诊，忽视不同PD阶段的类别不平衡问题，且大多只进行二元分类而非严重程度诊断。

Method: 集成多种面部表情特征通过注意力机制进行特征融合，采用自适应类别平衡策略根据类别分布和分类难度动态调整训练样本贡献度。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在PD严重程度诊断方面表现优异，注意力特征融合和自适应类别平衡策略均有效。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效诊断PD严重程度，多表情特征融合和自适应类别平衡策略显著提升了诊断性能。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) severity diagnosis is crucial for early detecting
potential patients and adopting tailored interventions. Diagnosing PD based on
facial expression is grounded in PD patients' "masked face" symptom and gains
growing interest recently for its convenience and affordability. However,
current facial expression-based approaches often rely on single type of
expression which can lead to misdiagnosis, and ignore the class imbalance
across different PD stages which degrades the prediction performance. Moreover,
most existing methods focus on binary classification (i.e., PD / non-PD) rather
than diagnosing the severity of PD. To address these issues, we propose a new
facial expression-based method for PD severity diagnosis which integrates
multiple facial expression features through attention-based feature fusion.
Moreover, we mitigate the class imbalance problem via an adaptive class
balancing strategy which dynamically adjusts the contribution of training
samples based on their class distribution and classification difficulty.
Experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed
method for PD severity diagnosis, as well as the efficacy of attention-based
feature fusion and adaptive class balancing.

Method: 提出闭环框架LoopTrans，包含统一跨模态定位和去噪知识蒸馏机制，实现自我中心和他者中心视角间的双向知识转移

Result: 在图像和视频基准测试中所有指标均取得一致提升，即使在人体完全遮挡物体交互区域的挑战性场景下也能处理

Conclusion: LoopTrans通过闭环双向知识转移有效弥合了视角差异，显著提升了弱监督功能基础任务的性能

Abstract: Humans can perform previously unexperienced interactions with novel objects
simply by observing others engage with them. Weakly-supervised affordance
grounding mimics this process by learning to locate object regions that enable
actions on egocentric images, using exocentric interaction images with
image-level annotations. However, extracting affordance knowledge solely from
exocentric images and transferring it one-way to egocentric images limits the
applicability of previous works in complex interaction scenarios. Instead, this
study introduces LoopTrans, a novel closed-loop framework that not only
transfers knowledge from exocentric to egocentric but also transfers back to
enhance exocentric knowledge extraction. Within LoopTrans, several innovative
mechanisms are introduced, including unified cross-modal localization and
denoising knowledge distillation, to bridge domain gaps between object-centered
egocentric and interaction-centered exocentric images while enhancing knowledge
transfer. Experiments show that LoopTrans achieves consistent improvements
across all metrics on image and video benchmarks, even handling challenging
scenarios where object interaction regions are fully occluded by the human
body.

Conclusion: 为马场实时行为监测提供了基础，对动物福利和厩舍管理具有重要意义。

Abstract: Monitoring the behavior of stalled horses is essential for early detection of
health and welfare issues but remains labor-intensive and time-consuming. In
this study, we present a prototype vision-based monitoring system that
automates the detection and tracking of horses and people inside stables using
object detection and multi-object tracking techniques. The system leverages
YOLOv11 and BoT-SORT for detection and tracking, while event states are
inferred based on object trajectories and spatial relations within the stall.
To support development, we constructed a custom dataset annotated with
assistance from foundation models CLIP and GroundingDINO. The system
distinguishes between five event types and accounts for the camera's blind
spots. Qualitative evaluation demonstrated reliable performance for
horse-related events, while highlighting limitations in detecting people due to
data scarcity. This work provides a foundation for real-time behavioral
monitoring in equine facilities, with implications for animal welfare and
stable management.

Motivation: 传统关键点检测器（SIFT、SURF等）和学习方法（SuperPoint、R2D2等）存在对光度变化敏感、关键点密度低、重复性差、适应性有限以及缺乏语义理解等问题。

Method: 首先融合7个关键点检测器和2个边缘检测器的输出创建真实掩码，提取多样视觉特征；然后使用轻量级ESPNet模型训练，使DeepDetect能够语义聚焦图像并产生密集关键点。

Result: 在Oxford Affine Covariant Regions数据集上，DeepDetect在关键点密度（0.5143）、重复性（0.9582）和正确匹配数（59,003）方面达到最大值，超越其他检测器。

Conclusion: DeepDetect通过融合传统检测器和深度学习，实现了在视觉退化条件下具有高密度、高重复性和强语义理解能力的关键点检测。

Abstract: Keypoint detection is the foundation of many computer vision tasks, including
image registration, structure-from motion, 3D reconstruction, visual odometry,
and SLAM. Traditional detectors (SIFT, SURF, ORB, BRISK, etc.) and learning
based methods (SuperPoint, R2D2, LF-Net, D2-Net, etc.) have shown strong
performance yet suffer from key limitations: sensitivity to photometric
changes, low keypoint density and repeatability, limited adaptability to
challenging scenes, and lack of semantic understanding, often failing to
prioritize visually important regions. We present DeepDetect, an intelligent,
all-in-one, dense keypoint detector that unifies the strengths of classical
detectors using deep learning. Firstly, we create ground-truth masks by fusing
outputs of 7 keypoint and 2 edge detectors, extracting diverse visual cues from
corners and blobs to prominent edges and textures in the images. Afterwards, a
lightweight and efficient model: ESPNet, is trained using these masks as
labels, enabling DeepDetect to focus semantically on images while producing
highly dense keypoints, that are adaptable to diverse and visually degraded
conditions. Evaluations on the Oxford Affine Covariant Regions dataset
demonstrate that DeepDetect surpasses other detectors in keypoint density,
repeatability, and the number of correct matches, achieving maximum values of
0.5143 (average keypoint density), 0.9582 (average repeatability), and 59,003
(correct matches).

and short tracks filtered by cosine consistency. On short videos, this
compressed-domain front end runs comparably to sequential SIFT while using far
less CPU, and yields denser matches with competitive pairwise geometry. As a
small SfM demo on a 117-frame clip, MV matches register all images and
reconstruct 0.46-0.62M points at 0.51-0.53,px reprojection error; BA time grows
with match density. These results show compressed-domain correspondences are a
practical, resource-efficient front end with clear paths to scaling in full
pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个高质量夜间图像去雨基准数据集HQ-NightRain和有效的颜色空间转换网络CST-Net，通过可学习的颜色空间转换器和隐式光照引导来更好地去除夜间复杂雨纹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夜间图像去雨相比白天更具挑战性，主要由于夜间场景的固有复杂性以及缺乏准确表示雨与光照耦合效应的高质量数据集。

Method: 开发了颜色空间转换网络CST-Net，包含可学习的颜色空间转换器来在Y通道进行雨纹去除，并引入隐式光照引导来增强模型在复杂场景中的鲁棒性。

Result: 大量实验证明了所提数据集的价值和方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的HQ-NightRain数据集和CST-Net方法在夜间图像去雨任务中表现出色，为这一具有挑战性的任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Compared to daytime image deraining, nighttime image deraining poses
significant challenges due to inherent complexities of nighttime scenarios and
the lack of high-quality datasets that accurately represent the coupling effect
between rain and illumination. In this paper, we rethink the task of nighttime
image deraining and contribute a new high-quality benchmark, HQ-NightRain,
which offers higher harmony and realism compared to existing datasets. In
addition, we develop an effective Color Space Transformation Network (CST-Net)
for better removing complex rain from nighttime scenes. Specifically, we
propose a learnable color space converter (CSC) to better facilitate rain
removal in the Y channel, as nighttime rain is more pronounced in the Y channel
compared to the RGB color space. To capture illumination information for
guiding nighttime deraining, implicit illumination guidance is introduced
enabling the learned features to improve the model's robustness in complex
scenarios. Extensive experiments show the value of our dataset and the
effectiveness of our method. The source code and datasets are available at

*Feng Zhou,Wenkai Guo,Pu Cao,Zhicheng Zhang,Jianqin Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种改进稀疏视图3D高斯溅射初始化的方法，通过频率感知SfM、3DGS自初始化和点云正则化来提升稀疏视图下的3D重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图3D高斯溅射容易过拟合训练视图，导致新视角渲染出现模糊等伪影。现有方法主要通过增强初始化或添加训练时约束来解决，但实验表明初始化是决定性因素。

Method: 1. 频率感知SfM：通过低频视图增强和宽松多视图对应改进低纹理区域覆盖；2. 3DGS自初始化：利用光度监督生成额外点，补充SfM稀疏区域；3. 点云正则化：通过几何/可见性先验确保多视图一致性和均匀空间覆盖。

Result: 在LLFF和Mip-NeRF360数据集上的实验表明，该方法在稀疏视图设置下取得了持续的性能提升，成为一个更强的初始化策略。

Conclusion: 初始化是稀疏视图3D高斯溅射的关键因素，提出的综合初始化方法能够显著提升重建质量，代码已开源。

Abstract: Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) often overfits to the training
views, leading to artifacts like blurring in novel view rendering. Prior work
addresses it either by enhancing the initialization (\emph{i.e.}, the point
cloud from Structure-from-Motion (SfM)) or by adding training-time constraints
(regularization) to the 3DGS optimization. Yet our controlled ablations reveal
that initialization is the decisive factor: it determines the attainable
performance band in sparse-view 3DGS, while training-time constraints yield
only modest within-band improvements at extra cost. Given initialization's
primacy, we focus our design there. Although SfM performs poorly under sparse
views due to its reliance on feature matching, it still provides reliable seed
points. Thus, building on SfM, our effort aims to supplement the regions it
fails to cover as comprehensively as possible. Specifically, we design: (i)
frequency-aware SfM that improves low-texture coverage via low-frequency view
augmentation and relaxed multi-view correspondences; (ii) 3DGS
self-initialization that lifts photometric supervision into additional points,
compensating SfM-sparse regions with learned Gaussian centers; and (iii)
point-cloud regularization that enforces multi-view consistency and uniform
spatial coverage through simple geometric/visibility priors, yielding a clean
and reliable point cloud. Our experiments on LLFF and Mip-NeRF360 demonstrate
consistent gains in sparse-view settings, establishing our approach as a
stronger initialization strategy. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有占用世界模型依赖静态固定嵌入或网格，限制了感知的灵活性，且其"原地分类"方法与真实场景的动态连续性存在潜在不匹配。

Method: 提出Range-Adaptive Perception模块（可学习查询由ego状态调制并增强时空关联）和State-Conditioned Forecasting模块（用回归引导公式替代基于分类的预测），以及Temporal-Aware Self-Scheduling训练策略。

Result: 在感知、预测和规划任务中达到最先进性能，验证了模型在灵活性、适应性和效率方面的优势。

Conclusion: SparseWorld通过稀疏动态查询成功解决了现有占用世界模型的局限性，为4D环境理解提供了更灵活和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic occupancy has emerged as a powerful representation in world models
for its ability to capture rich spatial semantics. However, most existing
occupancy world models rely on static and fixed embeddings or grids, which
inherently limit the flexibility of perception. Moreover, their ``in-place
classification" over grids exhibits a potential misalignment with the dynamic
and continuous nature of real scenarios.In this paper, we propose SparseWorld,
a novel 4D occupancy world model that is flexible, adaptive, and efficient,
powered by sparse and dynamic queries. We propose a Range-Adaptive Perception
module, in which learnable queries are modulated by the ego vehicle states and
enriched with temporal-spatial associations to enable extended-range
perception. To effectively capture the dynamics of the scene, we design a
State-Conditioned Forecasting module, which replaces classification-based
forecasting with regression-guided formulation, precisely aligning the dynamic
queries with the continuity of the 4D environment. In addition, We specifically
devise a Temporal-Aware Self-Scheduling training strategy to enable smooth and
efficient training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SparseWorld achieves
state-of-the-art performance across perception, forecasting, and planning
tasks. Comprehensive visualizations and ablation studies further validate the
advantages of SparseWorld in terms of flexibility, adaptability, and
efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/MSunDYY/SparseWorld.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: POTNet通过熵引导的双聚类头和最优传输技术生成高质量伪掩码，AutoSOD利用这些伪掩码实现无监督显著目标检测，性能接近全监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显著目标检测需要像素级标注，成本高昂。作者认为只要有可靠的伪掩码，无监督方法就能达到接近监督方法的精度。

Method: 提出POTNet，用熵引导的双聚类头替代单k-means：高熵像素用谱聚类，低熵像素用k-means，两组原型通过最优传输对齐，生成更清晰的伪掩码。AutoSOD使用这些伪掩码训练标准MaskFormer编码器-解码器。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，AutoSOD比无监督方法F-measure提升26%，比弱监督方法提升36%，进一步缩小了与全监督模型的差距。

Conclusion: 通过改进原型质量和全局一致性，无监督显著目标检测可以达到接近监督方法的性能，无需像素级标注。

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) aims to segment visually prominent regions in
images and serves as a foundational task for various computer vision
applications. We posit that SOD can now reach near-supervised accuracy without
a single pixel-level label, but only when reliable pseudo-masks are available.
We revisit the prototype-based line of work and make two key observations.
First, boundary pixels and interior pixels obey markedly different geometry;
second, the global consistency enforced by optimal transport (OT) is
underutilized if prototype quality is weak. To address this, we introduce
POTNet, an adaptation of Prototypical Optimal Transport that replaces POT's
single k-means step with an entropy-guided dual-clustering head: high-entropy
pixels are organized by spectral clustering, low-entropy pixels by k-means, and
the two prototype sets are subsequently aligned by OT. This
split-fuse-transport design yields sharper, part-aware pseudo-masks in a single
forward pass, without handcrafted priors. Those masks supervise a standard
MaskFormer-style encoder-decoder, giving rise to AutoSOD, an end-to-end
unsupervised SOD pipeline that eliminates SelfMask's offline voting yet
improves both accuracy and training efficiency. Extensive experiments on five
benchmarks show that AutoSOD outperforms unsupervised methods by up to 26% and
weakly supervised methods by up to 36% in F-measure, further narrowing the gap
to fully supervised models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于评分标准引导的伪标签提示框架，利用少量真实标注生成高质量伪标签，构建数据集自适应的评分标准来指导可解释的场景评估，实现无需训练的零样本视频摘要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督方法标注成本高且跨数据集泛化能力有限，无监督方法难以捕捉高层次语义和细粒度叙事线索，零样本提示方法对人工提示模板和数据集特定分数归一化敏感。

Method: 将少量真实标注转化为高置信度伪标签，聚合成结构化评分标准；推理时基于描述对首尾片段评分，中间片段结合相邻场景的上下文摘要来评估叙事进展和冗余度。

Result: 在SumMe和TVSum数据集上分别达到57.58和63.05的F1分数，超越了无监督和先前零样本基线方法，接近监督方法性能。

Conclusion: 评分标准引导的伪标签能有效稳定基于LLM的评分，为视频摘要建立了一个通用、可解释的零样本范式。

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of video content across social media,
surveillance, and education platforms, efficiently summarizing long videos into
concise yet semantically faithful surrogates has become increasingly vital.
Existing supervised methods achieve strong in-domain accuracy by learning from
dense annotations but suffer from high labeling costs and limited cross-dataset
generalization, while unsupervised approaches, though label-free, often fail to
capture high-level human semantics and fine-grained narrative cues. More
recently, zero-shot prompting pipelines have leveraged large language models
(LLMs) for training-free video summarization, yet remain highly sensitive to
handcrafted prompt templates and dataset-specific score normalization. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce a rubric-guided, pseudo-labeled
prompting framework that transforms a small subset of ground-truth annotations
into high-confidence pseudo labels, which are aggregated into structured,
dataset-adaptive scoring rubrics guiding interpretable scene evaluation. During
inference, first and last segments are scored based solely on their
descriptions, whereas intermediate ones incorporate brief contextual summaries
of adjacent scenes to assess narrative progression and redundancy. This
contextual prompting enables the LLM to balance local salience and global
coherence without parameter tuning. On SumMe and TVSum, our method achieves F1
scores of \textbf{57.58} and \textbf{63.05}, surpassing unsupervised and prior
zero-shot baselines while approaching supervised performance. The results
demonstrate that rubric-guided pseudo labeling effectively stabilizes LLM-based
scoring and establishes a general, interpretable zero-shot paradigm for video
summarization.

Conclusion: 成功开发了高效的大规模视频生成训练框架，开源了完整技术栈，首次公开利用Megatron-Core实现高训练效率和近线性多节点扩展的视频生成训练代码。

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale generative models for visual content
(\textit{e.g.,} images, videos, and 3D objects/scenes) have made remarkable
progress. However, training large-scale video generation models remains
particularly challenging and resource-intensive due to cross-modal text-video
alignment, the long sequences involved, and the complex spatiotemporal
dependencies. To address these challenges, we present a training framework that
optimizes four pillars: (i) data processing, (ii) model architecture, (iii)
training strategy, and (iv) infrastructure for large-scale video generation
models. These optimizations delivered significant efficiency gains and
performance improvements across all stages of data preprocessing, video
compression, parameter scaling, curriculum-based pretraining, and
alignment-focused post-training. Our resulting model, MUG-V 10B, matches recent
state-of-the-art video generators overall and, on e-commerce-oriented video
generation tasks, surpasses leading open-source baselines in human evaluations.
More importantly, we open-source the complete stack, including model weights,
Megatron-Core-based large-scale training code, and inference pipelines for
video generation and enhancement. To our knowledge, this is the first public
release of large-scale video generation training code that exploits
Megatron-Core to achieve high training efficiency and near-linear multi-node
scaling, details are available in

Conclusion: MambaX-Net为前列腺癌主动监测提供了一种有效的半监督分割解决方案，能够利用时间序列信息改进分割性能，减少对专家标注的依赖

Abstract: Active Surveillance (AS) is a treatment option for managing low and
intermediate-risk prostate cancer (PCa), aiming to avoid overtreatment while
monitoring disease progression through serial MRI and clinical follow-up.
Accurate prostate segmentation is an important preliminary step for automating
this process, enabling automated detection and diagnosis of PCa. However,
existing deep-learning segmentation models are often trained on
single-time-point and expertly annotated datasets, making them unsuitable for
longitudinal AS analysis, where multiple time points and a scarcity of expert
labels hinder their effective fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we
propose MambaX-Net, a novel semi-supervised, dual-scan 3D segmentation
architecture that computes the segmentation for time point t by leveraging the
MRI and the corresponding segmentation mask from the previous time point. We
introduce two new components: (i) a Mamba-enhanced Cross-Attention Module,
which integrates the Mamba block into cross attention to efficiently capture
temporal evolution and long-range spatial dependencies, and (ii) a Shape
Extractor Module that encodes the previous segmentation mask into a latent
anatomical representation for refined zone delination. Moreover, we introduce a
semi-supervised self-training strategy that leverages pseudo-labels generated
from a pre-trained nnU-Net, enabling effective learning without expert
annotations. MambaX-Net was evaluated on a longitudinal AS dataset, and results
showed that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art U-Net and
Transformer-based models, achieving superior prostate zone segmentation even
when trained on limited and noisy data.

Motivation: 减少对昂贵像素级标注的依赖，实现智能基础设施维护中可扩展的道路裂缝检测。

Method: 集成三个组件：生成类激活图的分类器、测量特征可推断性的重建器、产生像素级检测结果的检测器；设计路径感知注意力模块和中心增强CAM一致性模块。

Result: 在三个图像级数据集上的实验表明，WP-CrackNet达到与监督方法相当的结果，优于现有弱监督方法。

Conclusion: 该方法显著推进了可扩展道路检测，源代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: Road crack detection is essential for intelligent infrastructure maintenance
in smart cities. To reduce reliance on costly pixel-level annotations, we
propose WP-CrackNet, an end-to-end weakly-supervised method that trains with
only image-level labels for pixel-wise crack detection. WP-CrackNet integrates
three components: a classifier generating class activation maps (CAMs), a
reconstructor measuring feature inferability, and a detector producing
pixel-wise road crack detection results. During training, the classifier and
reconstructor alternate in adversarial learning to encourage crack CAMs to
cover complete crack regions, while the detector learns from pseudo labels
derived from post-processed crack CAMs. This mutual feedback among the three
components improves learning stability and detection accuracy. To further boost
detection performance, we design a path-aware attention module (PAAM) that
fuses high-level semantics from the classifier with low-level structural cues
from the reconstructor by modeling spatial and channel-wise dependencies.
Additionally, a center-enhanced CAM consistency module (CECCM) is proposed to
refine crack CAMs using center Gaussian weighting and consistency constraints,
enabling better pseudo-label generation. We create three image-level datasets
and extensive experiments show that WP-CrackNet achieves comparable results to
supervised methods and outperforms existing weakly-supervised methods,
significantly advancing scalable road inspection. The source code package and
datasets are available at https://mias.group/WP-CrackNet/.

Motivation: 现有的3D前馈模型（如VGGT）在静态数据集上训练，难以处理包含复杂动态元素（如移动人物或可变形物体）的真实世界场景。

Method: 提出动态感知聚合器，通过预测动态感知掩码来分离静态和动态信息——在姿态估计时抑制运动线索，在几何重建时增强它们。

Result: 在动态场景中，PAGE-4D持续优于原始VGGT，在相机姿态估计、单目和视频深度估计以及密集点云重建方面取得更优结果。

Conclusion: PAGE-4D成功解决了多任务4D重建中的任务冲突问题，为动态场景的3D属性推断提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent 3D feed-forward models, such as the Visual Geometry Grounded
Transformer (VGGT), have shown strong capability in inferring 3D attributes of
static scenes. However, since they are typically trained on static datasets,
these models often struggle in real-world scenarios involving complex dynamic
elements, such as moving humans or deformable objects like umbrellas. To
address this limitation, we introduce PAGE-4D, a feedforward model that extends
VGGT to dynamic scenes, enabling camera pose estimation, depth prediction, and
point cloud reconstruction -- all without post-processing. A central challenge
in multi-task 4D reconstruction is the inherent conflict between tasks:
accurate camera pose estimation requires suppressing dynamic regions, while
geometry reconstruction requires modeling them. To resolve this tension, we
propose a dynamics-aware aggregator that disentangles static and dynamic
information by predicting a dynamics-aware mask -- suppressing motion cues for
pose estimation while amplifying them for geometry reconstruction. Extensive
experiments show that PAGE-4D consistently outperforms the original VGGT in
dynamic scenarios, achieving superior results in camera pose estimation,
monocular and video depth estimation, and dense point map reconstruction.

Conclusion: UCIS-SAM通过专门设计的水下特征增强和频率域处理，有效解决了水下伪装实例分割的挑战，在多个数据集上取得了优越性能。

Abstract: With the development of underwater exploration and marine protection,
underwater vision tasks are widespread. Due to the degraded underwater
environment, characterized by color distortion, low contrast, and blurring,
camouflaged instance segmentation (CIS) faces greater challenges in accurately
segmenting objects that blend closely with their surroundings. Traditional
camouflaged instance segmentation methods, trained on terrestrial-dominated
datasets with limited underwater samples, may exhibit inadequate performance in
underwater scenes. To address these issues, we introduce the first underwater
camouflaged instance segmentation (UCIS) dataset, abbreviated as UCIS4K, which
comprises 3,953 images of camouflaged marine organisms with instance-level
annotations. In addition, we propose an Underwater Camouflaged Instance
Segmentation network based on Segment Anything Model (UCIS-SAM). Our UCIS-SAM
includes three key modules. First, the Channel Balance Optimization Module
(CBOM) enhances channel characteristics to improve underwater feature learning,
effectively addressing the model's limited understanding of underwater
environments. Second, the Frequency Domain True Integration Module (FDTIM) is
proposed to emphasize intrinsic object features and reduce interference from
camouflage patterns, enhancing the segmentation performance of camouflaged
objects blending with their surroundings. Finally, the Multi-scale Feature
Frequency Aggregation Module (MFFAM) is designed to strengthen the boundaries
of low-contrast camouflaged instances across multiple frequency bands,
improving the model's ability to achieve more precise segmentation of
camouflaged objects. Extensive experiments on the proposed UCIS4K and public
benchmarks show that our UCIS-SAM outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: 3D generation from natural language offers significant potential to reduce
expert manual modeling efforts and enhance accessibility to 3D assets. However,
existing methods often yield unstructured meshes and exhibit poor
interactivity, making them impractical for artistic workflows. To address these
limitations, we represent 3D assets as shape programs and introduce ShapeCraft,
a novel multi-agent framework for text-to-3D generation. At its core, we
propose a Graph-based Procedural Shape (GPS) representation that decomposes
complex natural language into a structured graph of sub-tasks, thereby
facilitating accurate LLM comprehension and interpretation of spatial
relationships and semantic shape details. Specifically, LLM agents
hierarchically parse user input to initialize GPS, then iteratively refine
procedural modeling and painting to produce structured, textured, and
interactive 3D assets. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate
ShapeCraft's superior performance in generating geometrically accurate and
semantically rich 3D assets compared to existing LLM-based agents. We further
show the versatility of ShapeCraft through examples of animated and
user-customized editing, highlighting its potential for broader interactive
applications.

Abstract: The advancement of UAV technology has enabled efficient, non-contact
structural health monitoring. Combined with photogrammetry, UAVs can capture
high-resolution scans and reconstruct detailed 3D models of infrastructure.
However, a key challenge remains in segmenting specific structural components
from these models-a process traditionally reliant on time-consuming and
error-prone manual labeling. To address this issue, we propose a machine
learning-based framework for automated segmentation of 3D point clouds. Our
approach uses the complementary strengths of real-world UAV-scanned point
clouds and synthetic data generated from Building Information Modeling (BIM) to
overcome the limitations associated with manual labeling. Validation on a
railroad track dataset demonstrated high accuracy in identifying and segmenting
major components such as rails and crossties. Moreover, by using smaller-scale
datasets supplemented with BIM data, the framework significantly reduced
training time while maintaining reasonable segmentation accuracy. This
automated approach improves the precision and efficiency of 3D infrastructure
model segmentation and advances the integration of UAV and BIM technologies in
structural health monitoring and infrastructure management.

Result: 在12个异常检测基准测试中，Dinomaly2在多种模态、任务设置和应用领域展现出全谱系优势。多类模型在MVTec-AD和VisA上分别达到99.9%和99.3%的图像级AUROC，仅用每个类别8个正常样本就超越了之前的全样本模型。

Conclusion: Dinomaly2凭借最小化设计、计算可扩展性和通用适用性，成为现实世界异常检测应用的统一解决方案，证明了简单性是真正普适性的基础。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) has evolved from building specialized
single-class models to unified multi-class models, yet existing multi-class
models significantly underperform the most advanced one-for-one counterparts.
Moreover, the field has fragmented into specialized methods tailored to
specific scenarios (multi-class, 3D, few-shot, etc.), creating deployment
barriers and highlighting the need for a unified solution. In this paper, we
present Dinomaly2, the first unified framework for full-spectrum image UAD,
which bridges the performance gap in multi-class models while seamlessly
extending across diverse data modalities and task settings. Guided by the "less
is more" philosophy, we demonstrate that the orchestration of five simple
element achieves superior performance in a standard reconstruction-based
framework. This methodological minimalism enables natural extension across
diverse tasks without modification, establishing that simplicity is the
foundation of true universality. Extensive experiments on 12 UAD benchmarks
demonstrate Dinomaly2's full-spectrum superiority across multiple modalities
(2D, multi-view, RGB-3D, RGB-IR), task settings (single-class, multi-class,
inference-unified multi-class, few-shot) and application domains (industrial,
biological, outdoor). For example, our multi-class model achieves unprecedented
99.9% and 99.3% image-level (I-) AUROC on MVTec-AD and VisA respectively. For
multi-view and multi-modal inspection, Dinomaly2 demonstrates state-of-the-art
performance with minimum adaptations. Moreover, using only 8 normal examples
per class, our method surpasses previous full-shot models, achieving 98.7% and
97.4% I-AUROC on MVTec-AD and VisA. The combination of minimalistic design,
computational scalability, and universal applicability positions Dinomaly2 as a
unified solution for the full spectrum of real-world anomaly detection
applications.

*Frédéric LIN,Biruk Abere Ambaw,Adrian Popescu,Hejer Ammar,Romaric Audigier,Hervé Le Borgne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaMiT是一个细粒度数据集，捕捉汽车模型随时间演变的过程，支持监督和自监督学习。研究发现静态预训练在跨年测试中准确率下降，提出了时间增量分类设置和两种策略来提升时间鲁棒性，并探索了时间感知图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统需要适应不断变化的视觉环境，特别是在对象外观随时间变化的领域。汽车模型作为技术产品的代表性类别，其外观演变需要被研究。

Method: 构建CaMiT数据集（787K标注样本和5.1M未标注样本），评估静态预训练性能，提出时间增量分类设置，包括时间增量预训练（更新主干网络）和时间增量分类器学习（仅更新最后一层），并探索时间感知图像生成。

Result: 静态预训练在领域内数据上能达到与大规模通用模型竞争的性能且更高效，但在跨年测试中准确率下降。时间增量策略能提升时间鲁棒性，时间感知图像生成能产生更真实的输出。

Conclusion: CaMiT为研究细粒度视觉识别和生成中的时间适应提供了丰富的基准，提出的时间增量方法能有效应对视觉环境的时间演变挑战。

Abstract: AI systems must adapt to evolving visual environments, especially in domains
where object appearances change over time. We introduce Car Models in Time
(CaMiT), a fine-grained dataset capturing the temporal evolution of car models,
a representative class of technological artifacts. CaMiT includes 787K labeled
samples of 190 car models (2007-2023) and 5.1M unlabeled samples (2005-2023),
supporting both supervised and self-supervised learning. Static pretraining on
in-domain data achieves competitive performance with large-scale generalist
models while being more resource-efficient, yet accuracy declines when models
are tested across years. To address this, we propose a time-incremental
classification setting, a realistic continual learning scenario with emerging,
evolving, and disappearing classes. We evaluate two strategies:
time-incremental pretraining, which updates the backbone, and time-incremental
classifier learning, which updates only the final layer, both improving
temporal robustness. Finally, we explore time-aware image generation that
leverages temporal metadata during training, yielding more realistic outputs.
CaMiT offers a rich benchmark for studying temporal adaptation in fine-grained
visual recognition and generation.

TL;DR: 提出DINO-CV分割框架，使用高分辨率机载LiDAR DEM自动映射低矮干石墙，通过自监督跨视图预训练解决数据稀缺问题，在植被覆盖区域实现有效检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 干石墙具有重要遗产和环境价值，但许多墙体因难以接近和人工测绘成本高而未被识别。深度学习分割提供可扩展解决方案，但面临植被遮挡和标记数据有限两大挑战。

Method: 使用LiDAR DEM克服植被遮挡，提出基于知识蒸馏的自监督跨视图预训练策略，学习多个DEM衍生物的视觉和几何表示，支持多种视觉骨干网络。

Result: 在Budj Bim UNESCO世界遗产地应用中，识别出澳大利亚最密集的殖民时期干石墙，测试区域mIoU达68.6%，仅用10%标记数据微调后仍保持63.8% mIoU。

Conclusion: 自监督学习在高分辨率DEM衍生物上具有巨大潜力，可在植被覆盖和遗产丰富但标注稀缺的环境中实现干石墙自动映射。

Abstract: Dry-stone walls hold significant heritage and environmental value. Mapping
these structures is essential for ecosystem preservation and wildfire
management in Australia. Yet, many walls remain unidentified due to their
inaccessibility and the high cost of manual mapping. Deep learning-based
segmentation offers a scalable solution, but two major challenges persist: (1)
visual occlusion of low-lying walls by dense vegetation, and (2) limited
labeled data for supervised training. We propose DINO-CV, a segmentation
framework for automatic mapping of low-lying dry-stone walls using
high-resolution Airborne LiDAR-derived digital elevation models (DEMs). DEMs
overcome visual occlusion by capturing terrain structures hidden beneath
vegetation, enabling analysis of structural rather than spectral cues. DINO-CV
introduces a self-supervised cross-view pre-training strategy based on
knowledge distillation to mitigate data scarcity. It learns invariant visual
and geometric representations across multiple DEM derivatives, supporting
various vision backbones including ResNet, Wide ResNet, and Vision
Transformers. Applied to the UNESCO World Heritage cultural landscape of Budj
Bim, Victoria, the method identifies one of Australia's densest collections of
colonial dry-stone walls beyond Indigenous heritage contexts. DINO-CV achieves
a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 68.6% on test areas and maintains
63.8% mIoU when fine-tuned with only 10% labeled data. These results
demonstrate the potential of self-supervised learning on high-resolution DEM
derivatives for automated dry-stone wall mapping in vegetated and heritage-rich
environments with scarce annotations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 比较两种节俭联邦学习方法进行暴力检测：零样本和联邦微调视觉语言模型(VLMs)与个性化训练紧凑3D卷积神经网络(CNN3D)。两种方法准确率均超90%，CNN3D在ROC AUC和log loss上略优且能耗更低，VLMs在上下文推理和多模态推理上更优。提出了混合模型策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究节俭的联邦学习方法进行暴力检测，特别关注能源效率和环境指标，为视频监控提供负责任、资源感知的AI基准。

Method: 使用LLaVA-7B和65.8M参数CNN3D作为代表案例，在现实非IID设置下评估准确性、校准和能耗。比较零样本和联邦微调VLMs与个性化训练CNN3D两种策略。

Result: 两种方法准确率均超过90%。CNN3D在ROC AUC和log loss上略优于LoRA调优的VLMs，且能耗更低。VLMs在上下文推理和多模态推理方面保持优势。量化了训练和推理过程中的能耗和CO2排放。

Conclusion: 支持混合模型：轻量级CNN用于常规分类，选择性激活VLM用于复杂或描述性场景。该框架为视频监控中负责任、资源感知的AI提供了可复现的基准。

Abstract: We examine frugal federated learning approaches to violence detection by
comparing two complementary strategies: (i) zero-shot and federated fine-tuning
of vision-language models (VLMs), and (ii) personalized training of a compact
3D convolutional neural network (CNN3D). Using LLaVA-7B and a 65.8M parameter
CNN3D as representative cases, we evaluate accuracy, calibration, and energy
usage under realistic non-IID settings. Both approaches exceed 90% accuracy.
CNN3D slightly outperforms Low-Rank Adaptation(LoRA)-tuned VLMs in ROC AUC and
log loss, while using less energy. VLMs remain favorable for contextual
reasoning and multimodal inference. We quantify energy and CO$_2$ emissions
across training and inference, and analyze sustainability trade-offs for
deployment. To our knowledge, this is the first comparative study of LoRA-tuned
vision-language models and personalized CNNs for federated violence detection,
with an emphasis on energy efficiency and environmental metrics. These findings
support a hybrid model: lightweight CNNs for routine classification, with
selective VLM activation for complex or descriptive scenarios. The resulting
framework offers a reproducible baseline for responsible, resource-aware AI in
video surveillance, with extensions toward real-time, multimodal, and
lifecycle-aware systems.

TL;DR: 4DSegStreamer是一个用于4D全景分割的流式处理框架，采用双线程系统实现高效处理，可集成到现有3D/4D分割方法中，在动态环境中提供实时细粒度感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高度动态环境（如密集人群疏散、复杂自动驾驶场景）中需要实时细粒度感知的问题，在有限时间预算内实现4D全景分割。

Method: 采用双线程系统：预测线程利用历史运动和几何信息提取特征并预测未来动态；推理线程通过对齐最新记忆并补偿自运动和动态物体移动，确保对输入帧的及时预测。

Result: 在室内HOI4D数据集和室外SemanticKITTI、nuScenes数据集上的综合实验表明，该方法在复杂场景中准确预测动态对象方面表现优异，特别是在高FPS条件下比现有流式感知方法更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 4DSegStreamer是一个通用且高效的流式4D全景分割框架，能够无缝集成到现有方法中，在动态环境中提供实时感知能力，特别适合复杂场景的动态对象预测。

Abstract: 4D panoptic segmentation in a streaming setting is critical for highly
dynamic environments, such as evacuating dense crowds and autonomous driving in
complex scenarios, where real-time, fine-grained perception within a
constrained time budget is essential. In this paper, we introduce
4DSegStreamer, a novel framework that employs a Dual-Thread System to
efficiently process streaming frames. The framework is general and can be
seamlessly integrated into existing 3D and 4D segmentation methods to enable
real-time capability. It also demonstrates superior robustness compared to
existing streaming perception approaches, particularly under high FPS
conditions. The system consists of a predictive thread and an inference thread.
The predictive thread leverages historical motion and geometric information to
extract features and forecast future dynamics. The inference thread ensures
timely prediction for incoming frames by aligning with the latest memory and
compensating for ego-motion and dynamic object movements. We evaluate
4DSegStreamer on the indoor HOI4D dataset and the outdoor SemanticKITTI and
nuScenes datasets. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, particularly in accurately predicting dynamic objects in complex
scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑模型主要关注指令完成度，但忽略了编辑操作伴随的物理效果（如阴影、反射、物体交互等），这些对生成真实性至关重要。

Method: 构建PICABench基准测试，涵盖8个物理子维度（光学、力学、状态转换等）和常见编辑操作；提出PICAEval评估协议，使用VLM作为评判者，结合区域级人工标注和问题；构建PICA-100K训练数据集从视频中学习物理知识。

Result: 评估主流模型后发现，物理真实性仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题，存在很大的改进空间。

Conclusion: 物理真实性是图像编辑领域的重要挑战，提出的基准测试和解决方案为从简单内容编辑向物理一致性真实感的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Image editing has achieved remarkable progress recently. Modern editing
models could already follow complex instructions to manipulate the original
content. However, beyond completing the editing instructions, the accompanying
physical effects are the key to the generation realism. For example, removing
an object should also remove its shadow, reflections, and interactions with
nearby objects. Unfortunately, existing models and benchmarks mainly focus on
instruction completion but overlook these physical effects. So, at this moment,
how far are we from physically realistic image editing? To answer this, we
introduce PICABench, which systematically evaluates physical realism across
eight sub-dimension (spanning optics, mechanics, and state transitions) for
most of the common editing operations (add, remove, attribute change, etc). We
further propose the PICAEval, a reliable evaluation protocol that uses
VLM-as-a-judge with per-case, region-level human annotations and questions.
Beyond benchmarking, we also explore effective solutions by learning physics
from videos and construct a training dataset PICA-100K. After evaluating most
of the mainstream models, we observe that physical realism remains a
challenging problem with large rooms to explore. We hope that our benchmark and
proposed solutions can serve as a foundation for future work moving from naive
content editing toward physically consistent realism.

Conclusion: IC-MoE有效补充了基础医学图像分割模型的高层特征表示能力，同时保持了预训练权重的结构完整性。

Abstract: Foundation models for medical image segmentation have achieved remarkable
performance. Adaptive fine-tuning of natural image segmentation foundation
models is crucial for medical image segmentation tasks. However, some
limitations exist in existing fine-tuning methods: 1) insufficient
representation of high-level features and 2) the fine-tuning process disrupts
the structural integrity of pretrained weights. Inspired by these critical
problems, we propose an intelligent communication mixture-of-experts
boosted-medical image segmentation foundation model, named IC-MoE, with twofold
ideas: 1) We construct basic experts, semantic experts, and adaptive experts.
Moreover, we implement a pixel probability adaptive voting strategy, which
enables expert selection and fusion through label consistency and load
balancing. This approach preliminarily enhances the representation capability
of high-level features while preserving the structural integrity of pretrained
weights. 2) We propose a semantic-guided contrastive learning method to address
the issue of weak supervision in contrastive learning. This method further
enhances the representation capability of high-level features while preserving
the structural integrity of pretrained weights. Extensive experiments across
three public medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate that the IC-MoE
outperforms other SOTA models. Consequently, the proposed IC-MoE effectively
supplements foundational medical image segmentation models with high-level
features and pretrained structural integrity. We also validate the superior
generalizability of the IC-MoE across diverse medical image segmentation
scenarios.

Result: 在所有多语言TIPR数据集上取得了新的最先进结果

Conclusion: Bi-IRRA框架有效解决了多语言文本-图像行人检索中的模态异质性问题，为多语言应用提供了可行方案

Abstract: Text-to-image person retrieval (TIPR) aims to identify the target person
using textual descriptions, facing challenge in modality heterogeneity. Prior
works have attempted to address it by developing cross-modal global or local
alignment strategies. However, global methods typically overlook fine-grained
cross-modal differences, whereas local methods require prior information to
explore explicit part alignments. Additionally, current methods are
English-centric, restricting their application in multilingual contexts. To
alleviate these issues, we pioneer a multilingual TIPR task by developing a
multilingual TIPR benchmark, for which we leverage large language models for
initial translations and refine them by integrating domain-specific knowledge.
Correspondingly, we propose Bi-IRRA: a Bidirectional Implicit Relation
Reasoning and Aligning framework to learn alignment across languages and
modalities. Within Bi-IRRA, a bidirectional implicit relation reasoning module
enables bidirectional prediction of masked image and text, implicitly enhancing
the modeling of local relations across languages and modalities, a
multi-dimensional global alignment module is integrated to bridge the modality
heterogeneity. The proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art results on all
multilingual TIPR datasets. Data and code are presented in
https://github.com/Flame-Chasers/Bi-IRRA.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D object detection and novel category detection have
made significant progress, yet research on learning generalized 3D objectness
remains insufficient. In this paper, we delve into learning open-world 3D
objectness, which focuses on detecting all objects in a 3D scene, including
novel objects unseen during training. Traditional closed-set 3D detectors
struggle to generalize to open-world scenarios, while directly incorporating 3D
open-vocabulary models for open-world ability struggles with vocabulary
expansion and semantic overlap. To achieve generalized 3D object discovery, We
propose OP3Det, a class-agnostic Open-World Prompt-free 3D Detector to detect
any objects within 3D scenes without relying on hand-crafted text prompts. We
introduce the strong generalization and zero-shot capabilities of 2D foundation
models, utilizing both 2D semantic priors and 3D geometric priors for
class-agnostic proposals to broaden 3D object discovery. Then, by integrating
complementary information from point cloud and RGB image in the cross-modal
mixture of experts, OP3Det dynamically routes uni-modal and multi-modal
features to learn generalized 3D objectness. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the extraordinary performance of OP3Det, which significantly surpasses existing
open-world 3D detectors by up to 16.0% in AR and achieves a 13.5% improvement
compared to closed-world 3D detectors.

Abstract: While diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art generation quality, they
still suffer from computationally expensive sampling. Recent works address this
issue with gradient-based optimization methods that distill a few-step ODE
diffusion solver from the full sampling process, reducing the number of
function evaluations from dozens to just a few. However, these approaches often
rely on intricate training techniques and do not explicitly focus on preserving
fine-grained details. In this paper, we introduce the Generalized Solver: a
simple parameterization of the ODE sampler that does not require additional
training tricks and improves quality over existing approaches. We further
combine the original distillation loss with adversarial training, which
mitigates artifacts and enhances detail fidelity. We call the resulting method
the Generalized Adversarial Solver and demonstrate its superior performance
compared to existing solver training methods under similar resource
constraints. Code is available at https://github.com/3145tttt/GAS.

Abstract: Vision foundation models achieve remarkable performance but are only

deployment choices under real-world constraints. We introduce SnapViT:
Single-shot network approximation for pruned Vision Transformers, a new

across a continuum of compute budgets. Our approach efficiently combines
gradient information with cross-network structure correlations, approximated
via an evolutionary algorithm, does not require labeled data, generalizes to

DINO, SigLIPv2, DeIT, and AugReg models demonstrate superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods across various sparsities, requiring less than five
minutes on a single A100 GPU to generate elastic models that can be adjusted to
any computational budget. Our key contributions include an efficient pruning
strategy for pretrained Vision Transformers, a novel evolutionary approximation
of Hessian off-diagonal structures, and a self-supervised importance scoring
mechanism that maintains strong performance without requiring retraining or

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting about 1% of
people over the age of 60, causing motor impairments that impede hand
coordination activities such as writing and drawing. Many approaches have tried
to support early detection of Parkinson's disease based on hand-drawn images;
however, we identified two major limitations in the related works: (1) the lack
of sufficient datasets, (2) the robustness when dealing with unseen patient
data. In this paper, we propose a new approach to detect Parkinson's disease
that consists of two stages: The first stage classifies based on their drawing
type(circle, meander, spiral), and the second stage extracts the required
features from the images and detects Parkinson's disease. We overcame the
previous two limitations by applying a chunking strategy where we divide each
image into 2x2 chunks. Each chunk is processed separately when extracting
features and recognizing Parkinson's disease indicators. To make the final
classification, an ensemble method is used to merge the decisions made from
each chunk. Our evaluation shows that our proposed approach outperforms the top
performing state-of-the-art approaches, in particular on unseen patients. On
the NewHandPD dataset our approach, it achieved 97.08% accuracy for seen
patients and 94.91% for unseen patients, our proposed approach maintained a gap
of only 2.17 percentage points, compared to the 4.76-point drop observed in
prior work.

Abstract: Circulating blood cell clusters (CCCs) containing red blood cells (RBCs),
white blood cells(WBCs), and platelets are significant biomarkers linked to
conditions like thrombosis, infection, and inflammation. Flow cytometry, paired
with fluorescence staining, is commonly used to analyze these cell clusters,
revealing cell morphology and protein profiles. While computational approaches
based on machine learning have advanced the automatic analysis of single-cell
flow cytometry images, there is a lack of effort to build tools to
automatically analyze images containing CCCs. Unlike single cells, cell
clusters often exhibit irregular shapes and sizes. In addition, these cell
clusters often consist of heterogeneous cell types, which require multi-channel
staining to identify the specific cell types within the clusters. This study
introduces a new computational framework for analyzing CCC images and
identifying cell types within clusters. Our framework uses a two-step analysis
strategy. First, it categorizes images into cell cluster and non-cluster groups
by fine-tuning the You Only Look Once(YOLOv11) model, which outperforms
traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViT).
Then, it identifies cell types by overlaying cluster contours with regions from
multi-channel fluorescence stains, enhancing accuracy despite cell debris and
staining artifacts. This approach achieved over 95% accuracy in both cluster
classification and phenotype identification. In summary, our automated
framework effectively analyzes CCC images from flow cytometry, leveraging both
bright-field and fluorescence data. Initially tested on blood cells, it holds
potential for broader applications, such as analyzing immune and tumor cell
clusters, supporting cellular research across various diseases.

TL;DR: RaindropGS是一个评估3D高斯溅射在雨滴条件下性能的综合基准，揭示了现有方法在无约束雨滴图像上的局限性，并分析了不同流程组件的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准通常使用已知相机姿态的合成雨滴图像评估3DGS，但在真实场景中，雨滴会干扰相机姿态估计和点云初始化，且合成与真实雨滴存在显著领域差距。

Method: 构建包含三个对齐图像集（雨滴聚焦、背景聚焦和无雨地面实况）的真实世界雨滴重建数据集，并设计完整评估流程：数据准备、数据处理和雨滴感知3DGS评估。

Result: 通过实验揭示了现有3DGS方法在无约束雨滴图像上的性能限制，以及相机焦点位置、不准确姿态和点云初始化对重建的干扰影响。

Conclusion: 这些发现为开发在雨滴条件下更鲁棒的3DGS方法提供了明确方向。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) under raindrop conditions suffers from severe
occlusions and optical distortions caused by raindrop contamination on the
camera lens, substantially degrading reconstruction quality. Existing
benchmarks typically evaluate 3DGS using synthetic raindrop images with known
camera poses (constrained images), assuming ideal conditions. However, in
real-world scenarios, raindrops often interfere with accurate camera pose
estimation and point cloud initialization. Moreover, a significant domain gap
between synthetic and real raindrops further impairs generalization. To tackle
these issues, we introduce RaindropGS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to
evaluate the full 3DGS pipeline-from unconstrained, raindrop-corrupted images
to clear 3DGS reconstructions. Specifically, the whole benchmark pipeline
consists of three parts: data preparation, data processing, and raindrop-aware
3DGS evaluation, including types of raindrop interference, camera pose
estimation and point cloud initialization, single image rain removal
comparison, and 3D Gaussian training comparison. First, we collect a real-world
raindrop reconstruction dataset, in which each scene contains three aligned
image sets: raindrop-focused, background-focused, and rain-free ground truth,
enabling a comprehensive evaluation of reconstruction quality under different
focus conditions. Through comprehensive experiments and analyses, we reveal
critical insights into the performance limitations of existing 3DGS methods on
unconstrained raindrop images and the varying impact of different pipeline
components: the impact of camera focus position on 3DGS reconstruction
performance, and the interference caused by inaccurate pose and point cloud
initialization on reconstruction. These insights establish clear directions for
developing more robust 3DGS methods under raindrop conditions.

Abstract: The recent development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has
significantly advanced AI's ability to understand visual modalities. However,
existing evaluation benchmarks remain limited to single-turn question
answering, overlooking the complexity of multi-turn dialogues in real-world
scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce MT-Video-Bench, a holistic video
understanding benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in multi-turn dialogues.
Specifically, our MT-Video-Bench mainly assesses six core competencies that
focus on perceptivity and interactivity, encompassing 987 meticulously curated
multi-turn dialogues from diverse domains. These capabilities are rigorously
aligned with real-world applications, such as interactive sports analysis and
multi-turn video-based intelligent tutoring. With MT-Video-Bench, we
extensively evaluate various state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source
MLLMs, revealing their significant performance discrepancies and limitations in
handling multi-turn video dialogues. The benchmark will be publicly available
to foster future research.

*Matheus Ramos Parracho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了签名伪造检测的特征学习策略，重点关注提高跨数据集泛化能力，比较了基于原始签名图像和壳预处理两种方法在不同基准数据集上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度学习在签名验证方面取得了进展，但大多数离线签名验证方法在跨数据集泛化方面仍存在困难，因为笔迹风格和采集协议的差异会降低性能。

Method: 使用三个公共基准数据集（CEDAR、ICDAR和GPDS Synthetic），开发了两个实验流程：一个基于原始签名图像，另一个采用壳预处理方法。

Result: 原始图像模型在跨基准测试中取得了更高的性能，而基于壳预处理的方法显示出未来改进以实现稳健跨域签名验证的潜力。

Conclusion: 两种方法各有优势，原始图像模型性能更好，但壳预处理方法具有进一步优化的潜力，为开发更稳健的跨域签名验证系统提供了方向。

Abstract: Automated signature verification is a critical biometric technique used in
banking, identity authentication, and legal documentation. Despite the notable
progress achieved by deep learning methods, most approaches in offline
signature verification still struggle to generalize across datasets, as
variations in handwriting styles and acquisition protocols often degrade
performance. This study investigates feature learning strategies for signature
forgery detection, focusing on improving cross-dataset generalization -- that
is, model robustness when trained on one dataset and tested on another. Using
three public benchmarks -- CEDAR, ICDAR, and GPDS Synthetic -- two experimental
pipelines were developed: one based on raw signature images and another
employing a preprocessing method referred to as shell preprocessing. Several
behavioral patterns were identified and analyzed; however, no definitive
superiority between the two approaches was established. The results show that
the raw-image model achieved higher performance across benchmarks, while the
shell-based model demonstrated promising potential for future refinement toward
robust, cross-domain signature verification.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多参考视觉地点识别中，面对不同条件下的参考集时，现有方法在数据多样性和模型复杂性增加时带来的计算成本问题。

Method: 使用矩阵分解将多个参考描述符分解为基表示，通过投影残差匹配进行地点识别，无需训练过程。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持轻量级的同时，在应对外观和视角变化时表现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: We address multi-reference visual place recognition (VPR), where reference
sets captured under varying conditions are used to improve localisation
performance. While deep learning with large-scale training improves robustness,
increasing data diversity and model complexity incur extensive computational
cost during training and deployment. Descriptor-level fusion via voting or
aggregation avoids training, but often targets multi-sensor setups or relies on
heuristics with limited gains under appearance and viewpoint change. We propose
a training-free, descriptor-agnostic approach that jointly models places using
multiple reference descriptors via matrix decomposition into basis
representations, enabling projection-based residual matching. We also introduce
SotonMV, a structured benchmark for multi-viewpoint VPR. On multi-appearance
data, our method improves Recall@1 by up to ~18% over single-reference and
outperforms multi-reference baselines across appearance and viewpoint changes,
with gains of ~5% on unstructured data, demonstrating strong generalisation
while remaining lightweight.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于双编码器和注意力机制的方法，结合病灶分割和临床元数据来提升皮肤病变分类的准确性和可解释性。


<details>

Motivation: 皮肤癌早期检测对患者预后至关重要，但现有深度学习模型存在"黑箱"问题，且皮肤病变图像存在类内差异大、类间差异小等挑战。

Method: 使用带双注意力门和空洞空间金字塔池化的Deep-UNet进行病灶分割，然后采用双DenseNet201编码器分别处理原始图像和分割病灶，通过多头交叉注意力融合特征，并集成基于transformer的患者元数据模块。

Result: 在HAM10000、ISIC 2018和2019数据集上实现了最先进的分割性能，显著提升了分类准确率和平均AUC，Grad-CAM热图验证了模型关注病灶区域而非背景伪特征。

Conclusion: 将精确的病灶分割、临床数据与基于注意力的特征融合相结合，能够构建更准确和可解释的皮肤癌分类模型。

Abstract: Skin cancer is a life-threatening disease where early detection significantly
improves patient outcomes. Automated diagnosis from dermoscopic images is
challenging due to high intra-class variability and subtle inter-class
differences. Many deep learning models operate as "black boxes," limiting
clinical trust. In this work, we propose a dual-encoder attention-based
framework that leverages both segmented lesions and clinical metadata to
enhance skin lesion classification in terms of both accuracy and
interpretability. A novel Deep-UNet architecture with Dual Attention Gates
(DAG) and Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) is first employed to segment
lesions. The classification stage uses two DenseNet201 encoders-one on the
original image and another on the segmented lesion whose features are fused via
multi-head cross-attention. This dual-input design guides the model to focus on
salient pathological regions. In addition, a transformer-based module
incorporates patient metadata (age, sex, lesion site) into the prediction. We
evaluate our approach on the HAM10000 dataset and the ISIC 2018 and 2019
challenges. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation
performance and significantly improves classification accuracy and average AUC
compared to baseline models. To validate our model's reliability, we use
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to generate heatmaps.
These visualizations confirm that our model's predictions are based on the
lesion area, unlike models that rely on spurious background features. These
results demonstrate that integrating precise lesion segmentation and clinical
data with attention-based fusion leads to a more accurate and interpretable
skin cancer classification model.

TL;DR: SparseVILA是一种新的高效视觉语言模型推理范式，通过在预填充阶段剪枝冗余视觉token，在解码阶段仅检索查询相关token，实现推理加速而不损失能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型的扩展性受到视觉token数量增长的制约，这些token主导了推理延迟。

Method: 采用解耦的视觉稀疏化方法：预填充阶段剪枝冗余视觉token，解码阶段检索查询相关token；基于AWQ优化的推理流水线。

Result: 在长上下文视频任务上实现4.0倍预填充加速、2.5倍解码加速和2.6倍端到端加速，同时在文档理解和推理任务上提高准确性。

Conclusion: 通过解耦查询无关剪枝和查询感知检索，SparseVILA为高效多模态推理提供了无需训练、架构无关的加速框架。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have rapidly advanced in integrating visual and
textual reasoning, powering applications across high-resolution image
understanding, long-video analysis, and multi-turn conversation. However, their
scalability remains limited by the growing number of visual tokens that
dominate inference latency. We present SparseVILA, a new paradigm for efficient
VLM inference that decouples visual sparsity across the prefilling and decoding
stages. SparseVILA distributes sparsity across stages by pruning redundant
visual tokens during prefill and retrieving only query-relevant tokens during
decoding. This decoupled design matches leading prefill pruning methods while
preserving multi-turn fidelity by retaining most of the visual cache so that
query-aware tokens can be retrieved at each conversation round. Built on an
AWQ-optimized inference pipeline, SparseVILA achieves up to 4.0 times faster
prefilling, 2.5 times faster decoding, and an overall 2.6 times end-to-end
speedup on long-context video tasks -- while improving accuracy on
document-understanding and reasoning tasks. By decoupling query-agnostic
pruning and query-aware retrieval, SparseVILA establishes a new direction for
efficient multimodal inference, offering a training-free, architecture-agnostic
framework for accelerating large VLMs without sacrificing capability.

TL;DR: 提出ConsistEdit方法，针对MM-DiT架构设计注意力控制机制，解决现有训练自由编辑方法在编辑强度与一致性之间的平衡问题，支持多轮和视频编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练自由注意力控制方法难以同时实现强编辑能力和源图像一致性，在多轮和视频编辑中视觉误差会累积，且全局一致性限制限制了细粒度编辑能力。

Method: 基于MM-DiT架构分析，提出ConsistEdit方法，包含视觉专用注意力控制、掩码引导预注意力融合、以及查询-键-值令牌的差异化操作。

Result: 在广泛图像和视频编辑任务中达到最先进性能，支持结构一致和不一致场景，是首个无需手工设计即可在所有推理步骤和注意力层进行编辑的方法。

Conclusion: ConsistEdit显著提升了可靠性和一致性，支持稳健的多轮和多区域编辑，并能渐进调整结构一致性，实现更精细的控制。

Abstract: Recent advances in training-free attention control methods have enabled
flexible and efficient text-guided editing capabilities for existing generation
models. However, current approaches struggle to simultaneously deliver strong
editing strength while preserving consistency with the source. This limitation
becomes particularly critical in multi-round and video editing, where visual
errors can accumulate over time. Moreover, most existing methods enforce global
consistency, which limits their ability to modify individual attributes such as
texture while preserving others, thereby hindering fine-grained editing.
Recently, the architectural shift from U-Net to MM-DiT has brought significant
improvements in generative performance and introduced a novel mechanism for
integrating text and vision modalities. These advancements pave the way for
overcoming challenges that previous methods failed to resolve. Through an
in-depth analysis of MM-DiT, we identify three key insights into its attention
mechanisms. Building on these, we propose ConsistEdit, a novel attention
control method specifically tailored for MM-DiT. ConsistEdit incorporates
vision-only attention control, mask-guided pre-attention fusion, and
differentiated manipulation of the query, key, and value tokens to produce
consistent, prompt-aligned edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ConsistEdit achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of image
and video editing tasks, including both structure-consistent and
structure-inconsistent scenarios. Unlike prior methods, it is the first
approach to perform editing across all inference steps and attention layers
without handcraft, significantly enhancing reliability and consistency, which
enables robust multi-round and multi-region editing. Furthermore, it supports
progressive adjustment of structural consistency, enabling finer control.
