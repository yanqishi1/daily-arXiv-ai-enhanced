The former often lacks clear explanations for forgery details,\nwhile the latter, which merges visual and linguistic modalities, is more prone\nto the issue of hallucinations.To address these shortcomings, we introduce a\nvisual detail enhanced self-correction framework, designated CorrDetail, for\ninterpretable face forgery detection. CorrDetail is meticulously designed to\nrectify authentic forgery details when provided with error-guided questioning,\nwith the aim of fostering the ability to uncover forgery details rather than\nyielding hallucinated responses. Additionally, to bolster the reliability of\nits findings, a visual fine-grained detail enhancement module is incorporated,\nsupplying CorrDetail with more precise visual forgery details. Ultimately, a\nfusion decision strategy is devised to further augment the model's\ndiscriminative capacity in handling extreme samples, through the integration of\nvisual information compensation and model bias reduction.Experimental results\ndemonstrate that CorrDetail not only achieves state-of-the-art performance\ncompared to the latest methodologies but also excels in accurately identifying\nforged details, all while exhibiting robust generalization capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCorrDetail\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7ec6\u8282\u589e\u5f3a\u81ea\u6821\u6b63\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4eba\u8138\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u9762\u90e8\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\u6784\u6210\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6709\u6548\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u6216\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86CorrDetail\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9519\u8bef\u5f15\u5bfc\u95ee\u9898\u6821\u6b63\u771f\u5b9e\u4f2a\u9020\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ec6\u8282\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u878d\u5408\u51b3\u7b56\u7b56\u7565\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCorrDetail\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u4f2a\u9020\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "CorrDetail\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4eba\u8138\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper introduces\nYOLO-APD, a novel deep learning architecture enhancing the YOLOv8 framework\nspecifically for this challenge. YOLO-APD integrates several key architectural\nmodifications: a parameter-free SimAM attention mechanism, computationally\nefficient C3Ghost modules, a novel SimSPPF module for enhanced multi-scale\nfeature pooling, the Mish activation function for improved optimization, and an\nIntelligent Gather & Distribute (IGD) module for superior feature fusion in the\nnetwork's neck. The concept of leveraging vehicle steering dynamics for\nadaptive region-of-interest processing is also presented. Comprehensive\nevaluations on a custom CARLA dataset simulating complex scenarios demonstrate\nthat YOLO-APD achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy, reaching 77.7%\nmAP@0.5:0.95 and exceptional pedestrian recall exceeding 96%, significantly\noutperforming baseline models, including YOLOv8. Furthermore, it maintains\nreal-time processing capabilities at 100 FPS, showcasing a superior balance\nbetween accuracy and efficiency.

Leveraging recent advances in brain-computer interfaces\n(BCIs) and generative models, we propose LoongX, a hands-free image editing\napproach driven by multimodal neurophysiological signals. LoongX utilizes\nstate-of-the-art diffusion models trained on a comprehensive dataset of 23,928\nimage editing pairs, each paired with synchronized electroencephalography\n(EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), photoplethysmography\n(PPG), and head motion signals that capture user intent. To effectively address\nthe heterogeneity of these signals, LoongX integrates two key modules. The\ncross-scale state space (CS3) module encodes informative modality-specific\nfeatures. The dynamic gated fusion (DGF) module further aggregates these\nfeatures into a unified latent space, which is then aligned with edit semantics\nvia fine-tuning on a diffusion transformer (DiT). Additionally, we pre-train\nthe encoders using contrastive learning to align cognitive states with semantic\nintentions from embedded natural language.

To address these challenges, we developed a vision\nguided, AI-driven variable rate sprayer system capable of detecting weed\npresence, estimating canopy size, and dynamically adjusting nozzle activation\nin real time. The system integrates lightweight YOLO11n and YOLO11n-seg deep\nlearning models, deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano for onboard inference,\nand uses an Arduino Uno-based relay interface to control solenoid actuated\nnozzles based on canopy segmentation results. Indoor trials were conducted\nusing 15 potted Hibiscus rosa sinensis plants of varying canopy sizes to\nsimulate a range of weed patch scenarios. The YOLO11n model achieved a mean\naverage precision (mAP@50) of 0.98, with a precision of 0.99 and a recall close\nto 1.0. The YOLO11n-seg segmentation model achieved a mAP@50 of 0.48, precision\nof 0.55, and recall of 0.52. System performance was validated using water\nsensitive paper, which showed an average spray coverage of 24.22% in zones\nwhere canopy was present.

To address this, we propose LoomNet, a novel multi-view\ndiffusion architecture that produces coherent images by applying the same\ndiffusion model multiple times in parallel to collaboratively build and\nleverage a shared latent space for view consistency. Each viewpoint-specific\ninference generates an encoding representing its own hypothesis of the novel\nview from a given camera pose, which is projected onto three orthogonal planes.\nFor each plane, encodings from all views are fused into a single aggregated\nplane.

To leverage both the specialized strengths of small models and the\nrich semantic understanding of LLMs, we introduce a flipped knowledge\ndistillation paradigm, where LLM learns from SLM. Specifically, we address the\narchitectural gap between decoder-only LLMs and smaller encoder-based models by\nreinterpreting LLMs in an encoder-decoder manner using LoRA. The encoder\ngenerates compressed representations, while the decoder maps them to the output\nspace. During training, the encoder produces representations and their\nsimilarities, which are then aligned with the similarity scores produced by the\nteacher, using our proposed Margin-aware Contrastive Learning (MCL) approach.\nThe MCL ensures accurate similarity for both positive and negative pairs, and\nadaptively handles the internal differences within positive and negative\nsamples. Our paradigm requires only a reasonably good-performing SLM, allowing\nthe LLM to achieve improved performance.

In this\npaper, we propose a novel Cross-modal Transition-guided Network (CTNet) to\ntackle the challenges in the multi-modal FAS task. Our motivation stems from\nthat, within a single modality, the visual differences between live faces are\ntypically much smaller than those of spoof faces. Additionally, feature\ntransitions across modalities are more consistent for the live class compared\nto those between live and spoof classes. Upon this insight, we first propose\nlearning consistent cross-modal feature transitions among live samples to\nconstruct a generalized feature space.

Traditional\nmethods, reliant on manual inspection or early image processing algorithms,\nsuffer from inefficiencies, high costs, and limited robustness. This paper\nintroduces a semi-supervised defect detection framework based on conditional\ndiffusion (DSYM), leveraging a two-stage collaborative training mechanism and a\nstaged joint optimization strategy. The framework utilizes labeled data for\ninitial training and subsequently incorporates unlabeled data through the\ngeneration of pseudo-labels. A conditional diffusion model synthesizes\nmulti-scale pseudo-defect samples, while a CLIP cross-modal feature-based noise\nfiltering mechanism mitigates label contamination. Experimental results on the\nNEU-DET dataset demonstrate a 78.4% mAP@0.5 with the same amount of labeled\ndata as traditional supervised methods, and 75.1% mAP@0.5 with only 40% of the\nlabeled data required by the original supervised model, showcasing significant\nadvantages in data efficiency.

Existing works pay more attention to\nimproving video reconstruction quality but little attention to the decoding\nspeed. However, the high computation of convolutional network used in existing\nmethods leads to low decoding speed. Moreover, these convolution-based video\nrepresentation methods also suffer from long training time, about 14 seconds\nper frame to achieve 35+ PSNR on Bunny. To solve the above problems, we propose\nGSVR, a novel 2D Gaussian-based video representation, which achieves 800+ FPS\nand 35+ PSNR on Bunny, only needing a training time of $2$ seconds per frame.\nSpecifically, we propose a hybrid deformation field to model the dynamics of\nthe video, which combines two motion patterns, namely the tri-plane motion and\nthe polynomial motion, to deal with the coupling of camera motion and object\nmotion in the video. Furthermore, we propose a Dynamic-aware Time Slicing\nstrategy to adaptively divide the video into multiple groups of pictures(GOP)\nbased on the dynamic level of the video in order to handle large camera motion\nand non-rigid movements. Finally, we propose quantization-aware fine-tuning to\navoid performance reduction after quantization and utilize image codecs to\ncompress Gaussians to achieve a compact representation. Experiments on the\nBunny and UVG datasets confirm that our method converges much faster than\nexisting methods and also has 10x faster decoding speed compared to other\nmethods.

Designers usually\norganize their work into objects, backgrounds, and vectorized text layers to\nsimplify editing. However, this workflow demands considerable expertise. With\nthe rise of GenAI methods, an endless supply of high-quality graphic designs in\npixel format has become more accessible, though these designs often lack\neditability.

It is built around a vision language model (VLM) playing distinct\nroles in three curated stages. For each stage, we design prompts to guide the\nVLM in executing different tasks. Distinct from existing bottom-up methods\n(e.g., COLE and Open-COLE) that gradually generate elements to create layered\ndesigns, our approach works in a top-down manner by using the visually\nharmonious reference image as global guidance to decompose each layer.\nAdditionally, it leverages multiple vision experts such as SAM and element\nremoval models to facilitate the creation of graphic layers.

It\nenables the user to give a multimodal query, comprising a reference image and a\nmodification text, and subsequently retrieve the target image.

Existing prompt-based and adapter-based\nworks have made significant progress in fine-tuning VLMs but still face the\nchallenges of maintaining strong generalization abilities, particularly towards\nunseen new classes. This limitation partly arises from these methods treating\nall tokens of the image and text encoder equally, which can lead to overfitting\non less informative features (e.g., background noise, template words) and\ndegrade the general representations that are crucial for novel concept\nrecognition. To address this issue, we propose Dynamic Rank Adaptation (DRA), a\nnovel adapter variant method, designed specifically to enhance new class\ngeneralization. DRA dynamically allocates adaptation ranks based on the\nimportance of features during training to preserve general knowledge. DRA first\nemploys token importance grouping, using sequence attention to evaluate and\ngroup tokens by their importance. Then, we adopt rank adaptation according to\nthe importance of each token group dynamically by assigning higher feature\nranks to the more important tokens.

Although\nvanilla Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can learn specific spatial or temporal\nmovement to driven VDMs with constrained data, achieving precise control over\nboth camera trajectories and object motion remains challenging due to the\nunstable fusion and non-linear scalability. To address these issues, we propose\nLiON-LoRA, a novel framework that rethinks LoRA fusion through three core\nprinciples: Linear scalability, Orthogonality, and Norm consistency. First, we\nanalyze the orthogonality of LoRA features in shallow VDM layers, enabling\ndecoupled low-level controllability. Second, norm consistency is enforced\nacross layers to stabilize fusion during complex camera motion combinations.\nThird, a controllable token is integrated into the diffusion transformer (DiT)\nto linearly adjust motion amplitudes for both cameras and objects with a\nmodified self-attention mechanism to ensure decoupled control. Additionally, we\nextend LiON-LoRA to temporal generation by leveraging static-camera videos,\nunifying spatial and temporal controllability. Experiments demonstrate that\nLiON-LoRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in trajectory control accuracy\nand motion strength adjustment, achieving superior generalization with minimal\ntraining data.

However, these\ndatasets were captured under fixed illumination and camera settings, leaving\nthe impact of real-world variations in illumination, exposure, gain or\ndepth-sensor mode - and the potential of test-time sensor control to mitigate\nsuch variations - largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce\nSenseShift6D, the first RGB-D dataset that physically sweeps 13 RGB exposures,\n9 RGB gains, auto-exposure, 4 depth-capture modes, and 5 illumination levels.\nFor three common household objects (spray, pringles, and tincase), we acquire\n101.9k RGB and 10k depth images, which can provide 1,380 unique sensor-lighting\npermutations per object pose. Experiments with state-of-the-art models on our\ndataset show that applying sensor control during test-time induces greater\nperformance improvement over digital data augmentation, achieving performance\ncomparable to or better than costly increases in real-world training data\nquantity and diversity. Adapting either RGB or depth sensors individually is\neffective, while jointly adapting multimodal RGB-D configurations yields even\ngreater improvements. SenseShift6D extends the 6D-pose evaluation paradigm from\ndata-centered to sensor-aware robustness, laying a foundation for adaptive,\nself-tuning perception systems capable of operating robustly in uncertain\nreal-world environments.

In this paper, we\nintroduce DreamArt, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity,\ninteractable articulated assets from single-view images.

Experimental results\ndemonstrate that DreamArt effectively generates high-quality articulated\nobjects, possessing accurate part shape, high appearance fidelity, and\nplausible articulation, thereby providing a scalable solution for articulated\nasset generation.

Although recent approaches leveraging pre-trained\nvision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved performance in the\nopen-vocabulary setting, they commonly ignore the inherent limitations of VLMs\nin spatial relation reasoning, such as difficulty in distinguishing object\nrelative positions, which results in suboptimal relation prediction. Motivated\nby the denoising diffusion model's inversion process in preserving the spatial\nstructure of input images, we propose SPADE (SPatial-Aware Denoising-nEtwork)\nframework -- a novel approach for open-vocabulary PSG. SPADE consists of two\nkey steps: (1) inversion-guided calibration for the UNet adaptation, and (2)\nspatial-aware context reasoning. In the first step, we calibrate a general\npre-trained teacher diffusion model into a PSG-specific denoising network with\ncross-attention maps derived during inversion through a lightweight LoRA-based\nfine-tuning strategy. In the second step, we develop a spatial-aware relation\ngraph transformer that captures both local and long-range contextual\ninformation, facilitating the generation of high-quality relation queries.\nExtensive experiments on benchmark PSG and Visual Genome datasets demonstrate\nthat SPADE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both closed- and open-set\nscenarios, particularly for spatial relationship prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "SPADE\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u53bb\u566a\u7f51\u7edc\u6539\u8fdb\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u5168\u666f\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5173\u7cfb\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u7406\u60f3\u3002", "method": "SPADE\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1a(1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u8f6c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684UNet\u6821\u51c6\uff0c(2) \u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u5173\u7cfb\u56fe\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728PSG\u548cVisual Genome\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cSPADE\u5728\u5c01\u95ed\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "SPADE\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5168\u666f\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u3002"}}

Our study\ndemonstrates that incorporating human-generated editorials, solutions, and\ndiverse test cases, as well as leveraging model mixtures, can substantially\nenhance both the performance and robustness of LLMs. Furthermore, we reveal\nboth the consistency and inconsistency in the cognition of LLMs that may\nfacilitate self-reflection and self-improvement, providing a potential\ndirection for developing more powerful coding models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Code Triangle\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1a\u7f16\u8f91\u5206\u6790\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u751f\u6210\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u80fd\u5f62\u6210\u81ea\u6d3d\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4eba\u7c7b\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6df7\u5408\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Code Triangle\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f16\u8f91\u5206\u6790\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u751f\u6210\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6df7\u5408\u8fdb\u884c\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u6d3d\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u5185\u5bb9\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6df7\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5f3a\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u80fd\u3002"}}

Existing methods often\nsuffer from limited spatial modeling capacity, weak generalization across crop\ntypes and years. To address these challenges, we propose DFYP, a novel Dynamic\nFusion framework for crop Yield Prediction, which combines spectral channel\nattention, edge-adaptive spatial modeling and a learnable fusion mechanism to\nimprove robustness across diverse agricultural scenarios. Specifically, DFYP\nintroduces three key components: (1) a Resolution-aware Channel Attention (RCA)\nmodule that enhances spectral representation by adaptively reweighting input\nchannels based on resolution-specific characteristics; (2) an Adaptive Operator\nLearning Network (AOL-Net) that dynamically selects operators for convolutional\nkernels to improve edge-sensitive spatial feature extraction under varying crop\nand temporal conditions; and (3) a dual-branch architecture with a learnable\nfusion mechanism, which jointly models local spatial details and global\ncontextual information to support cross-resolution and cross-crop\ngeneralization. Extensive experiments on multi-year datasets MODIS and\nmulti-crop dataset Sentinel-2 demonstrate that DFYP consistently outperforms\ncurrent state-of-the-art baselines in RMSE, MAE, and R2 across different\nspatial resolutions, crop types, and time periods, showcasing its effectiveness\nand robustness for real-world agricultural monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "DFYP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u8c31\u901a\u9053\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3001\u8fb9\u7f18\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7a7a\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4f5c\u7269\u4ea7\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u8de8\u4f5c\u7269\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u5e74\u4efd\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0cDFYP\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "DFYP\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u901a\u9053\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\uff08RCA\uff09\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u7f51\u7edc\uff08AOL-Net\uff09\u548c\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728MODIS\u548cSentinel-2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDFYP\u5728RMSE\u3001MAE\u548cR2\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DFYP\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u519c\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u519c\u4e1a\u76d1\u6d4b\u3002"}}

For reconstruction, we perform control-point-guided motion\ncompensation and employ a refinement network to enhance view-consistent\nfidelity. Trained on multi-view video-derived Gaussian frames, D-FCGS\ngeneralizes across scenes without per-scene optimization. Experiments show that\nit matches the rate-distortion performance of optimization-based methods,\nachieving over 40 times compression in under 2 seconds while preserving visual\nquality across viewpoints.

Latent reasoning tackles this\nbottleneck by performing multi-step inference entirely in the model's\ncontinuous hidden state, eliminating token-level supervision. To advance latent\nreasoning research, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the\nemerging field of latent reasoning. We begin by examining the foundational role\nof neural network layers as the computational substrate for reasoning,\nhighlighting how hierarchical representations support complex transformations.\nNext, we explore diverse latent reasoning methodologies, including\nactivation-based recurrence, hidden state propagation, and fine-tuning\nstrategies that compress or internalize explicit reasoning traces. Finally, we\ndiscuss advanced paradigms such as infinite-depth latent reasoning via masked\ndiffusion models, which enable globally consistent and reversible reasoning\nprocesses. By unifying these perspectives, we aim to clarify the conceptual\nlandscape of latent reasoning and chart future directions for research at the\nfrontier of LLM cognition.

Most xAI methods and the related evaluation metrics in RS are initially\ndeveloped for natural images considered in computer vision (CV), and their\ndirect usage in RS may not be suitable. To address this issue, in this paper,\nwe investigate the effectiveness of explanation methods and metrics in the\ncontext of RS image scene classification. In detail, we methodologically and\nexperimentally analyze ten explanation metrics spanning five categories\n(faithfulness, robustness, localization, complexity, randomization), applied to\nfive established feature attribution methods (Occlusion, LIME, GradCAM, LRP,\nand DeepLIFT) across three RS datasets. Our methodological analysis identifies\nkey limitations in both explanation methods and metrics. The performance of\nperturbation-based methods, such as Occlusion and LIME, heavily depends on\nperturbation baselines and spatial characteristics of RS scenes. Gradient-based\napproaches like GradCAM struggle when multiple labels are present in the same\nimage, while some relevance propagation methods (LRP) can distribute relevance\ndisproportionately relative to the spatial extent of classes. Analogously, we\nfind limitations in evaluation metrics. Faithfulness metrics share the same\nproblems as perturbation-based methods. Localization metrics and complexity\nmetrics are unreliable for classes with a large spatial extent. In contrast,\nrobustness metrics and randomization metrics consistently exhibit greater\nstability.

Existing methods typically rely on real-time GNSS and IMU data, that\nrequire pre-calibration and assume stable positioning during data collection.\nHowever, this assumption often fails in dense urban areas, resulting in\nlocalization errors. To address this, we propose a structured geo-registration\nand spatial correction method that aligns 3D point clouds with satellite\nimages, enabling frame-wise recovery of GNSS information and reconstruction of\ncity scale 3D maps without relying on prior localization. The proposed approach\nemploys a pre-trained Point Transformer model to segment the road points and\nthen extracts the road skeleton and intersection points from the point cloud as\nwell as the target map for alignment. Global rigid alignment of the two is\nperformed using the intersection points, followed by local refinement using\nradial basis function (RBF) interpolation. Elevation correction is then applied\nto the point cloud based on terrain information from SRTM dataset to resolve\nvertical discrepancies. The proposed method was tested on the popular KITTI\nbenchmark and a locally collected Perth (Western Australia) CBD dataset.

However, the consistent disadvantage of these\nmodels is that they cannot generate readable, meaningful, and correctly spelled\ntext in generated images, which significantly limits the use of practical\npurposes like advertising, learning, and creative design. This paper introduces\na new framework, namely Glyph-Conditioned Diffusion with Character-Aware\nAttention (GCDA), using which a typical diffusion backbone is extended by three\nwell-designed modules. To begin with, the model has a dual-stream text encoder\nthat encodes both semantic contextual information and explicit glyph\nrepresentations, resulting in a character-aware representation of the input\ntext that is rich in nature.

Previous methods\nrely on incomplete and non-generalizable geometric constraints, leading to\nmisalignment between the positions of Gaussian splats and the actual scene\ngeometry. When dealing with real-world scenes containing complex geometry, the\naccumulation of Gaussians further exacerbates surface artifacts and results in\nblurred reconstructions. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose\nRef-Unlock, a novel geometry-aware reflection modeling framework based on 3D\nGaussian Splatting, which explicitly disentangles transmitted and reflected\ncomponents to better capture complex reflections and enhance geometric\nconsistency in real-world scenes. Our approach employs a dual-branch\nrepresentation with high-order spherical harmonics to capture high-frequency\nreflective details, alongside a reflection removal module providing pseudo\nreflection-free supervision to guide clean decomposition. Additionally, we\nincorporate pseudo-depth maps and a geometry-aware bilateral smoothness\nconstraint to enhance 3D geometric consistency and stability in decomposition.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that Ref-Unlock significantly outperforms\nclassical GS-based reflection methods and achieves competitive results with\nNeRF-based models, while enabling flexible vision foundation models (VFMs)\ndriven reflection editing. Our method thus offers an efficient and\ngeneralizable solution for realistic rendering of reflective scenes.

However, when involving generating\nmulti-object images as real scenarios, most existing methods either rely\nentirely on text condition, resulting in a deviation between the generated\nobjects and the original data, or rely too much on the original images,\nresulting in a lack of diversity in the generated images, which is of limited\nhelp to downstream tasks. To mitigate both problems with one stone, we propose\na prompt-free conditional diffusion framework for multi-object image\naugmentation. Specifically, we introduce a local-global semantic fusion\nstrategy to extract semantics from images to replace text, and inject knowledge\ninto the diffusion model through LoRA to alleviate the category deviation\nbetween the original model and the target dataset. In addition, we design a\nreward model based counting loss to assist the traditional reconstruction loss\nfor model training.

Our training exclusively utilizes multi-view consistency\nself-supervision without any form of semantic or geometric ground truth. Given\na single input image, SceneDINO infers the 3D geometry and expressive 3D DINO\nfeatures in a feed-forward manner.

Current approaches predominantly utilize a\nthree-stage pipeline encompassing dual-modal encoding, cross-modal interaction,\nand pixel decoding. These methods demonstrate significant limitations in\nmanaging complex semantic relationships and achieving precise cross-modal\nalignment, largely due to their coupled processing mechanism that conflates\ntarget localization with boundary delineation. This architectural coupling\namplifies error propagation under semantic ambiguity while restricting model\ngeneralizability and interpretability. To address these issues, we propose\nRSRefSeg 2, a decoupling paradigm that reformulates the conventional workflow\ninto a collaborative dual-stage framework: coarse localization followed by fine\nsegmentation. RSRefSeg 2 integrates CLIP's cross-modal alignment strength with\nSAM's segmentation generalizability through strategic foundation model\ncollaboration. Specifically, CLIP is employed as the dual-modal encoder to\nactivate target features within its pre-aligned semantic space and generate\nlocalization prompts. To mitigate CLIP's misactivation challenges in\nmulti-entity scenarios described by referring texts, a cascaded second-order\nprompter is devised, which enhances precision through implicit reasoning via\ndecomposition of text embeddings into complementary semantic subspaces. These\noptimized semantic prompts subsequently direct the SAM to generate pixel-level\nrefined masks, thereby completing the semantic transmission pipeline. Extensive\nexperiments (RefSegRS, RRSIS-D, and RISBench) demonstrate that RSRefSeg 2\nsurpasses contemporary methods in segmentation accuracy (+~3% gIoU) and complex\nsemantic interpretation.
