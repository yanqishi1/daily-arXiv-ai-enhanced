### [1] [Bridging the Semantic Gap: Contrastive Rewards for Multilingual Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13827)
*Ashish Kattamuri,Ishita Prasad,Meetu Malhotra,Arpita Vats,Rahul Raja,Albert Lie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合GRPO和多语言对比奖励信号的新框架，用于提升跨语言Text-to-SQL系统的任务效率和语义准确性，在3B参数模型上实现了优于8B零样本模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Text-to-SQL方法只关注可执行查询，忽略了语义对齐挑战，且从英语到其他语言的执行准确率平均下降6个百分点。

Method: 使用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)结合多语言对比奖励信号，通过基于语义相似度的奖励信号来改善SQL生成与用户意图的对应关系。

Result: 在MultiSpider数据集上，LLaMA-3-3B模型经GRPO微调后执行准确率达87.4%，语义准确率达52.29%；添加对比奖励信号后平均语义准确率提升至59.14%。3B模型执行准确率比8B零样本模型高7.43个百分点。

Conclusion: 通过对比奖励信号实现定向语义对齐，可以在不需要大规模训练数据集的情况下显著提升Text-to-SQL系统性能。

Abstract: Current Text-to-SQL methods are evaluated and only focused on executable
queries, overlooking the semantic alignment challenge -- both in terms of the
semantic meaning of the query and the correctness of the execution results.
Even execution accuracy itself shows significant drops when moving from English
to other languages, with an average decline of 6 percentage points across
non-English languages. We address these challenges by presenting a new
framework that combines Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) within a
multilingual contrastive reward signal to enhance both task efficiency and
semantic accuracy in Text-to-SQL systems in cross-lingual scenarios. Our method
teaches models to obtain better correspondence between SQL generation and user
intent by combining a reward signal based on semantic similarity. On the
seven-language MultiSpider dataset, fine-tuning the LLaMA-3-3B model with GRPO
improved the execution accuracy up to 87.4 percent (+26 pp over zero-shot) and
semantic accuracy up to 52.29 percent (+32.86 pp). Adding our contrastive
reward signal in the GRPO framework further improved the average semantic
accuracy to 59.14 percent (+6.85 pp, up to +10 pp for Vietnamese). Our
experiments showcase that a smaller, parameter-efficient 3B LLaMA model
fine-tuned with our contrastive reward signal outperforms a much larger
zero-shot 8B LLaMA model, with an uplift of 7.43 pp in execution accuracy (from
81.43 percent on the 8B model to 88.86 percent on the 3B model), and nearly
matches its semantic accuracy (59.14 percent vs. 68.57 percent) -- all using
just 3,000 reinforcement learning training examples. These results demonstrate
how we can improve the performance of Text-to-SQL systems with contrastive
rewards for directed semantic alignment, without requiring large-scale training
datasets.

### [2] [From Explainability to Action: A Generative Operational Framework for Integrating XAI in Clinical Mental Health Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13828)
*Ratna Kandala,Akshata Kishore Moharir,Divya Arvinda Nayak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出生成式操作框架，利用LLM作为翻译引擎，将XAI技术输出转化为临床可用的叙述，解决精神健康筛查中AI可解释性的临床应用障碍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前XAI技术（如SHAP和LIME）虽然能生成技术准确的特征重要性分数，但无法提供临床相关、可操作的见解，导致实验室到临床应用的转化障碍。

Method: 提出生成式操作框架，使用LLM作为核心翻译引擎，整合多种XAI工具的技术输出和临床指南（通过RAG），自动生成人类可读、有证据支持的临床叙述。

Result: 该框架直接解决了工作流集成、偏见缓解和利益相关者特定沟通等关键操作障碍，为临床实践提供了集成、可操作且可信赖的AI解决方案。

Conclusion: 该研究为超越孤立数据点生成，向临床实践提供集成、可操作且可信赖的AI指明了战略路线图，解决了XAI在精神健康筛查中的实际应用问题。

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has been presented as the critical
component for unlocking the potential of machine learning in mental health
screening (MHS). However, a persistent lab-to-clinic gap remains. Current XAI
techniques, such as SHAP and LIME, excel at producing technically faithful
outputs such as feature importance scores, but fail to deliver clinically
relevant, actionable insights that can be used by clinicians or understood by
patients. This disconnect between technical transparency and human utility is
the primary barrier to real-world adoption. This paper argues that this gap is
a translation problem and proposes the Generative Operational Framework, a
novel system architecture that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as a
central translation engine. This framework is designed to ingest the raw,
technical outputs from diverse XAI tools and synthesize them with clinical
guidelines (via RAG) to automatically generate human-readable, evidence-backed
clinical narratives. To justify our solution, we provide a systematic analysis
of the components it integrates, tracing the evolution from intrinsic models to
generative XAI. We demonstrate how this framework directly addresses key
operational barriers, including workflow integration, bias mitigation, and
stakeholder-specific communication. This paper also provides a strategic
roadmap for moving the field beyond the generation of isolated data points
toward the delivery of integrated, actionable, and trustworthy AI in clinical
practice.

### [3] [A Linguistics-Aware LLM Watermarking via Syntactic Predictability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13829)
*Shinwoo Park,Hyejin Park,Hyeseon Ahn,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STELA是一个公开可验证的水印框架，通过基于词性n-gram的语言自由度动态调整水印强度，在保持文本质量的同时提高检测鲁棒性，无需访问模型logits。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水印方法依赖模型输出分布信号，需要访问模型logits，阻碍了公开验证。需要一种不依赖模型特定信号的公开可验证水印方法。

Method: 利用词性n-gram建模的语言不确定性动态调制水印信号：在语法约束强的上下文中减弱信号以保持质量，在语言灵活性高的上下文中增强信号以提高可检测性。

Result: 在分析性英语、孤立性汉语和黏着性韩语等多种语言类型上的实验表明，STELA在检测鲁棒性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: STELA通过语言自由度对齐水印强度，实现了公开可验证的水印检测，在保持文本质量的同时显著提高了检测鲁棒性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance rapidly, reliable
governance tools have become critical. Publicly verifiable watermarking is
particularly essential for fostering a trustworthy AI ecosystem. A central
challenge persists: balancing text quality against detection robustness. Recent
studies have sought to navigate this trade-off by leveraging signals from model
output distributions (e.g., token-level entropy); however, their reliance on
these model-specific signals presents a significant barrier to public
verification, as the detection process requires access to the logits of the
underlying model. We introduce STELA, a novel framework that aligns watermark
strength with the linguistic degrees of freedom inherent in language. STELA
dynamically modulates the signal using part-of-speech (POS) n-gram-modeled
linguistic indeterminacy, weakening it in grammatically constrained contexts to
preserve quality and strengthen it in contexts with greater linguistic
flexibility to enhance detectability. Our detector operates without access to
any model logits, thus facilitating publicly verifiable detection. Through
extensive experiments on typologically diverse languages-analytic English,
isolating Chinese, and agglutinative Korean-we show that STELA surpasses prior
methods in detection robustness. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Shinwoo-Park/stela_watermark.

### [4] [Users as Annotators: LLM Preference Learning from Comparison Mode](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13830)
*Zhongze Cai,Xiaocheng Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种通过用户标注收集成对偏好数据的新方法，利用两个不同模型生成响应的不对称性来推断用户数据质量，并开发EM算法估计用户潜在质量因子以过滤数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统成对偏好数据依赖专业人工标注，而用户在日常交互中提供的偏好标签虽然用户最了解自己查询的响应质量，但缺乏质量控制。

Method: 通过两个不同模型生成响应，利用这种不对称性建立用户行为模型，开发期望最大化算法估计用户潜在质量因子，据此过滤用户标注数据。

Result: 下游任务验证了该方法在捕捉用户行为和LLM对齐数据过滤方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 用户标注的成对偏好数据结合质量过滤机制是LLM对齐的有效方法，用户是最了解自己查询响应的专家。

Abstract: Pairwise preference data have played an important role in the alignment of
large language models (LLMs). Each sample of such data consists of a prompt,
two different responses to the prompt, and a binary label indicating which of
the two responses is better. The labels are usually annotated by professional
human annotators. In this paper, we consider an alternative approach to collect
pairwise preference data -- user annotation from comparison mode. With the
increasingly wider adoption of LLMs among the population, users are
contributing more and more of their preference labels through their daily
interactions with the LLMs. The upside of such labels is that users are the
best experts in judging the responses to their own queries/prompts, but the
downside is the lack of quality control in these labels. In this paper, we
consider a new idea of generating two responses from two different models or
two different versions of the same model. The asymmetry allows us to make an
inference of the user's data quality through our proposed user behavior model.
We develop an expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate a latent quality
factor of the user, and filter users' annotation data accordingly. The
downstream task shows the effectiveness of our approach in both capturing the
user behavior and data filtering for LLM alignment.

### [5] [Informed Routing in LLMs: Smarter Token-Level Computation for Faster Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13831)
*Chao Han,Yijuan Liang,Zihao Xuan,Daokuan Wu,Wei Zhang,Xiaoyu Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为"知情路由"的新范式，通过轻量级特征预测器评估令牌的重要性和可恢复性，实现执行或近似策略，显著降低LLM推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态令牌级计算分配方法依赖贪婪路由，导致不可逆信息丢失和次优令牌选择，限制了LLM在实际应用中的部署。

Method: 引入轻量级特征预测器(LFF)来估计单元输出，实现灵活的"执行或近似"策略，在保持模型保真度的同时大幅减少计算量。

Result: 在语言建模和推理任务上的广泛实验表明，知情路由在多个稀疏度水平上实现了最先进的效率-性能权衡，无需最终LoRA微调即可匹配或超越需要完全微调的强基线方法。

Conclusion: 知情路由通过前瞻性地评估令牌重要性和可恢复性，有效解决了贪婪路由的局限性，显著提升了LLM的推理效率。

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications is
increasingly limited by their high inference cost. While recent advances in
dynamic token-level computation allocation attempt to improve efficiency by
selectively activating model components per token, existing methods rely on
greedy routing--a myopic execute-or-skip mechanism that often leads to
irreversible information loss and suboptimal token selection. This paper
introduces informed routing, a new paradigm that proactively addresses these
issues. The key insight is to assess not only a token's immediate importance
but also its recoverability, i.e., how well its transformation can be
approximated. To this end, we propose the Lightweight Feature Forecaster (LFF),
a small predictive module that estimates a unit's output before routing
decisions are made. This enables a flexible execute-or-approximate policy that
preserves model fidelity while drastically reducing computation. Extensive
experiments on both language modeling and reasoning tasks show that informed
routing achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-performance trade-offs across
multiple sparsity levels. Notably, even without final LoRA fine-tuning, our
method matches or surpasses strong baselines that require full fine-tuning, all
while reducing training time by over 50%. The code is available at:

### [6] [Entropy Meets Importance: A Unified Head Importance-Entropy Score for Stable and Efficient Transformer Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13832)
*Minsik Choi,Hyegang Son,Changhoon Kim,Young Geun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出HIES剪枝方法，结合注意力熵和头重要性分数，相比仅使用HIS方法在模型质量和稳定性上分别提升15.2%和2.04倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型虽然性能优异，但多层多头结构导致推理效率问题。现有基于HIS的剪枝方法仅考虑梯度驱动贡献，忽略了注意力模式的多样性。

Method: 提出HIES（头重要性-熵分数）剪枝标准，将头重要性分数与注意力熵相结合，提供更全面的头部贡献评估。

Result: 基于HIES的剪枝方法在模型质量上提升15.2%，稳定性提升2.04倍，实现了显著的模型压缩而不损失精度或稳定性。

Conclusion: HIES方法通过整合多维度信息，有效克服了HIS方法的局限性，为Transformer模型的高效部署提供了更好的剪枝解决方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have achieved remarkable performance in NLP tasks.
However, their structural characteristics-multiple layers and attention
heads-introduce efficiency challenges in inference and deployment. To address
these challenges, various pruning methods have recently been proposed. Notably,
gradient-based methods using Head Importance Scores (HIS) have gained traction
for interpretability, efficiency, and ability to identify redundant heads.
However, HIS alone has limitations as it captures only the gradient-driven
contribution, overlooking the diversity of attention patterns. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce a novel pruning criterion, HIES (Head
Importance-Entropy Score), which integrates head importance scores with
attention entropy, providing complementary evidence on per-head contribution.
Empirically, HIES-based pruning yields up to 15.2% improvement in model quality
and 2.04x improvement in stability over HIS-only methods, enabling substantial
model compression without sacrificing either accuracy or stability. Code will
be released upon publication.

### [7] [ConDABench: Interactive Evaluation of Language Models for Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13835)
*Avik Dutta,Priyanshu Gupta,Hosein Hasanbeig,Rahul Pratap Singh,Harshit Nigam,Sumit Gulwani,Arjun Radhakrishna,Gustavo Soares,Ashish Tiwari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConDABench是一个用于生成对话式数据分析基准测试的框架，包含多智能体工作流生成的1,420个问题，以及首个系统评估对话数据分析工具的评价体系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据分析任务通常目标不明确且数据不干净，需要用户交互来理解意图，但现有基准测试无法捕捉这种复杂性或提供交互支持。

Method: 使用多智能体工作流从公开数据集的文章中生成真实基准测试，创建了1,420个对话式数据分析问题，并开发了系统评估工具。

Result: 评估发现新一代LLM能解决更多实例，但在需要持续长时交互的任务上表现不佳。

Conclusion: ConDABench为模型构建者提供了衡量真正协作模型在复杂交互任务上进展的途径。

Abstract: Real-world data analysis tasks often come with under-specified goals and
unclean data. User interaction is necessary to understand and disambiguate a
user's intent, and hence, essential to solving these complex tasks. Existing
benchmarks for evaluating LLMs on data analysis tasks do not capture these
complexities or provide first-class support for interactivity. We introduce
ConDABench, a framework for generating conversational data analysis (ConDA)
benchmarks and evaluating external tools on the generated benchmarks. \bench
consists of (a) a multi-agent workflow for generating realistic benchmarks from
articles describing insights gained from public datasets, (b) 1,420 ConDA
problems generated using this workflow, and (c) an evaluation harness that, for
the first time, makes it possible to systematically evaluate conversational
data analysis tools on the generated ConDA problems. Evaluation of
state-of-the-art LLMs on the benchmarks reveals that while the new generation
of models are better at solving more instances, they are not necessarily better
at solving tasks that require sustained, long-form engagement. ConDABench is an
avenue for model builders to measure progress towards truly collaborative
models that can complete complex interactive tasks.

### [8] [SIMBA UQ: Similarity-Based Aggregation for Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13836)
*Debarun Bhattacharjya,Balaji Ganesan,Junkyu Lee,Radu Marinescu,Katsiaryna Mirylenka,Michael Glass,Xiao Shou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型的不确定性量化方法，提出了基于相似性的黑盒UQ框架，能更好地校准模型输出的置信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不确定性量化是可信AI系统的关键组件，黑盒方法具有适应性强、成本低等优势，需要研究其有效性。

Method: 提出基于相似性的非语言化聚合框架，包含多种UQ方法，并引入使用小训练集训练置信度估计模型的新技术。

Result: 在问答、摘要和文本转SQL等多样化任务上的实证研究表明，提出的相似性方法比基线方法能产生更好校准的置信度。

Conclusion: 基于相似性的黑盒UQ方法能有效量化LLM的不确定性，为可信AI系统提供可靠支持。

Abstract: When does a large language model (LLM) know what it does not know?
Uncertainty quantification (UQ) provides measures of uncertainty, such as an
estimate of the confidence in an LLM's generated output, and is therefore
increasingly recognized as a crucial component of trusted AI systems. Black-box
UQ methods do not require access to internal model information from the
generating LLM and therefore have numerous real-world advantages, such as
robustness to system changes, adaptability to choice of LLM, reduced costs, and
computational tractability. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of
UQ techniques that are primarily but not necessarily entirely black-box, where
the consistency between a generated output and other sampled generations is
used as a proxy for confidence in its correctness. We propose a high-level
non-verbalized similarity-based aggregation framework that subsumes a broad
swath of UQ approaches suitable for complex generative tasks, as well as
introduce specific novel techniques from the framework that train confidence
estimation models using small training sets. Through an empirical study with
datasets spanning the diverse tasks of question answering, summarization, and
text-to-SQL, we demonstrate that our proposed similarity-based methods can
yield better calibrated confidences than baselines.

### [9] [Seeing Hate Differently: Hate Subspace Modeling for Culture-Aware Hate Speech Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13837)
*Weibin Cai,Reza Zafarani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种文化感知的仇恨言论检测框架，通过构建个体仇恨子空间来解决训练标签偏见和文化背景差异问题，在各项指标上平均优于现有方法1.05%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有仇恨言论检测方法忽略了现实世界的复杂性：训练标签存在偏见，且不同文化背景的个体对仇恨言论的认定标准存在差异。

Method: 构建文化感知框架，通过建模文化属性组合来缓解数据稀疏性，使用标签传播捕捉每个组合的独特特征，最终构建个体仇恨子空间。

Result: 实验表明该方法在所有指标上平均优于现有最先进方法1.05%。

Conclusion: 提出的文化感知框架能有效解决仇恨言论检测中的数据稀疏性、文化纠缠和标签模糊问题，并通过个体仇恨子空间进一步提升分类性能。

Abstract: Hate speech detection has been extensively studied, yet existing methods
often overlook a real-world complexity: training labels are biased, and
interpretations of what is considered hate vary across individuals with
different cultural backgrounds. We first analyze these challenges, including
data sparsity, cultural entanglement, and ambiguous labeling. To address them,
we propose a culture-aware framework that constructs individuals' hate
subspaces. To alleviate data sparsity, we model combinations of cultural
attributes. For cultural entanglement and ambiguous labels, we use label
propagation to capture distinctive features of each combination. Finally,
individual hate subspaces, which in turn can further enhance classification
performance. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art by 1.05\%
on average across all metrics.

*Dekai Zhang,Simone Conia,Antonio Rago*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用大语言模型从原始评论文本中自动提取产品本体（以部分整体关系形式）的方法，该方法优于现有的基于BERT的基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动构建本体耗时、昂贵且费力，而当前数字时代需要组织大量非结构化文本，特别是在电子商务等领域需要适当的产品组织。

Method: 利用大语言模型的最新进展，开发了从原始评论文本中自动提取产品本体的全自动方法，以部分整体关系的形式表示。

Result: 通过LLM作为评判标准进行评估，证明该方法生成的本体优于现有的基于BERT的基线模型。

Conclusion: 本研究为更广泛地使用LLM进行产品或其他领域本体提取奠定了基础。

Abstract: Ontologies have become essential in today's digital age as a way of
organising the vast amount of readily available unstructured text. In providing
formal structure to this information, ontologies have immense value and
application across various domains, e.g., e-commerce, where countless product
listings necessitate proper product organisation. However, the manual
construction of these ontologies is a time-consuming, expensive and laborious
process. In this paper, we harness the recent advancements in large language
models (LLMs) to develop a fully-automated method of extracting product
ontologies, in the form of meronymies, from raw review texts. We demonstrate
that the ontologies produced by our method surpass an existing, BERT-based
baseline when evaluating using an LLM-as-a-judge. Our investigation provides
the groundwork for LLMs to be used more generally in (product or otherwise)
ontology extraction.

### [11] [ADMIT: Few-shot Knowledge Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based Fact Checking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13842)
*Yutao Wu,Xiao Liu,Yinghui Li,Yifeng Gao,Yifan Ding,Jiale Ding,Xiang Zheng,Xingjun Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ADMIT是一种针对事实核查RAG系统的知识投毒攻击方法，通过少量语义对齐的投毒内容翻转事实核查决策，无需访问目标模型即可实现高成功率攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究真实世界事实核查场景中的知识投毒威胁，因为在真实场景中可信证据通常主导检索结果，这使得攻击更具挑战性。

Method: 提出ADMIT（对抗性多重注入技术），这是一种少样本、语义对齐的投毒攻击方法，无需访问目标LLM、检索器或令牌级控制。

Result: 在4个检索器、11个LLM和4个跨领域基准测试中，ADMIT平均攻击成功率达到86%，投毒率极低（0.93×10^-6），即使在存在强反证的情况下仍保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ADMIT相比现有最先进攻击方法在所有设置下提升11.2%的攻击成功率，暴露了现实世界基于RAG的事实核查系统的显著脆弱性。

Abstract: Knowledge poisoning poses a critical threat to Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems by injecting adversarial content into knowledge bases, tricking
Large Language Models (LLMs) into producing attacker-controlled outputs
grounded in manipulated context. Prior work highlights LLMs' susceptibility to
misleading or malicious retrieved content. However, real-world fact-checking
scenarios are more challenging, as credible evidence typically dominates the
retrieval pool. To investigate this problem, we extend knowledge poisoning to
the fact-checking setting, where retrieved context includes authentic
supporting or refuting evidence. We propose \textbf{ADMIT}
(\textbf{AD}versarial \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{I}njection \textbf{T}echnique), a
few-shot, semantically aligned poisoning attack that flips fact-checking
decisions and induces deceptive justifications, all without access to the
target LLMs, retrievers, or token-level control. Extensive experiments show
that ADMIT transfers effectively across 4 retrievers, 11 LLMs, and 4
cross-domain benchmarks, achieving an average attack success rate (ASR) of 86\%
at an extremely low poisoning rate of $0.93 \times 10^{-6}$, and remaining
robust even in the presence of strong counter-evidence. Compared with prior
state-of-the-art attacks, ADMIT improves ASR by 11.2\% across all settings,
exposing significant vulnerabilities in real-world RAG-based fact-checking
systems.

*Zhirong Chou,Quan Qin,Shi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SerialBEHRT是一个基于SciBERT的医疗领域基础模型，通过结构化电子健康记录序列的额外预训练，能够更好地捕捉临床事件间的时序关系，在抗生素敏感性预测任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以协调电子健康记录的表格化、事件化特性与自然语言模型的序列先验之间的结构不匹配，限制了其捕捉患者就诊间纵向依赖关系的能力。

Method: 扩展SciBERT模型，通过在结构化电子健康记录序列上进行额外预训练，设计用于编码临床事件间的时间和上下文关系。

Result: 在抗生素敏感性预测任务上，SerialBEHRT相比最先进的电子健康记录表示策略实现了更优越和更一致的表现。

Conclusion: 时序序列化在医疗基础模型预训练中具有重要意义，SerialBEHRT证明了其在捕捉临床事件间依赖关系方面的有效性。

Abstract: The emergence of foundation models in healthcare has opened new avenues for
learning generalizable representations from large scale clinical data. Yet,
existing approaches often struggle to reconcile the tabular and event based
nature of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with the sequential priors of
natural language models. This structural mismatch limits their ability to
capture longitudinal dependencies across patient encounters. We introduce
SerialBEHRT, a domain aligned foundation model that extends SciBERT through
additional pretraining on structured EHR sequences. SerialBEHRT is designed to
encode temporal and contextual relationships among clinical events, thereby
producing richer patient representations. We evaluate its effectiveness on the
task of antibiotic susceptibility prediction, a clinically meaningful problem
in antibiotic stewardship. Through extensive benchmarking against state of the
art EHR representation strategies, we demonstrate that SerialBEHRT achieves
superior and more consistent performance, highlighting the importance of
temporal serialization in foundation model pretraining for healthcare.

### [13] [DynaSpec: Context-aware Dynamic Speculative Sampling for Large-Vocabulary Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13847)
*Jinbin Zhang,Nasib Ullah,Erik Schultheis,Rohit Babbar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DynaSpec提出了一种上下文相关的动态短列表机制，通过轻量级元分类器将上下文路由到少量token簇中，解决传统固定短列表方法在词汇表扩展时的延迟瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM词汇表的扩展，传统固定短列表方法存在两个问题：频率列表依赖语料库且需要重新调整，静态短列表抑制了罕见或领域特定token，降低了每次验证步骤的预期token数量。

Method: 引入轻量级粗粒度元分类器，将上下文路由到少量token簇中；选定的前k个簇的并集形成草稿器的短列表，同时验证保留完整词汇表和精确性；通过并行执行草稿编码和元短列表计算来提前完成元分类器计算。

Result: 在标准推测解码基准测试中，相比固定短列表基线，在平均接受长度上获得了一致的增益，同时上下文相关选择使得可以使用更小的短列表而不降低接受率。

Conclusion: DynaSpec提供了一种稳健、加速草稿过程且能跨多样化任务泛化的动态短列表机制，有效解决了词汇表扩展带来的延迟瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Speculative decoding (a.k.a. speculative sampling) has become a standard way
to accelerate LLM inference: a small drafter proposes multiple tokens and a
large target model verifies them once per speculation length. Recently, scaling
of the LLM vocabulary has pushed the number of tokens to grow substantially.
While verification over the full vocabulary leaves the target model largely
unaffected, the O(|V|d) parameters in the drafter's output head become a
latency bottleneck, slowing the entire pipeline. Contemporary methods (e.g.,
FR-Spec, VocabTrim) restrict the drafter's vocabulary to a fixed subset of the
target model's vocabulary, ranked in descending order of token frequency.
Although this reduces draft-time compute, it is brittle, since: (i) frequency
lists are corpus-dependent and require retuning to generalize, and (ii) static
shortlists suppress rare or domain-specific tokens, lowering the expected
number of tokens per verification step. We propose DynaSpec, a
context-dependent dynamic shortlisting mechanism that is robust, speeds up
drafting, and generalizes across diverse tasks. Concretely, we introduce
lightweight, coarse-grained meta-classifiers that route contexts to a small
number of token clusters; the union of the top-k selected clusters forms the
drafter's shortlist, while verification retains the full vocabulary and
exactness. The meta-classifier finishes its computation earlier than the
drafter's hidden state generation by exploiting parallel execution of draft
encoding and meta shortlisting on separate streams. On standard
speculative-decoding benchmarks, we observe consistent gains in mean accepted
length over fixed-shortlist baselines, while context-dependent selection
enables smaller shortlists without degrading acceptance.

tasks via parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adapters
(LoRA). While adapters can be combined to handle multiple tasks separately,
standard approaches struggle when targeting the simultaneous execution of
complex tasks, such as generating a translated summary from a long
conversation. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach tailored
specifically for compositional multi-tasking scenarios involving summarization
and translation. Our technique involves adding a learnable projection layer on
top of the combined summarization and translation adapters. This design enables
effective integration while maintaining efficiency through reduced
computational overhead compared to alternative strategies requiring extensive
retraining or sequential processing. We demonstrate the practical viability of
our method within an on-device environment by developing an Android app capable
of executing compositional tasks seamlessly. Experimental results indicate our
solution performs well and is fast in both cloud-based and on-device
implementations, highlighting the potential benefits of adopting our framework
in real-world applications demanding high-speed operation alongside resource
constraints.

*Andrey Goncharov,Nikolai Kondusov,Alexey Zaytsev*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级的推理时方法，通过PCA识别语言方向并引导token嵌入来控制语言身份，有效减少多语言LLM中的代码切换问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大语言模型经常出现意外的代码切换现象，降低了在下游任务中的可靠性。

Method: 使用潜在空间语言引导，通过对平行翻译进行PCA分析识别语言方向，并沿这些轴引导token嵌入来控制语言身份。

Result: 实现了95-99%的语言分类准确率，在多个语言对上将下一个token分布差异减少了高达42%，在Qwen2.5和Llama-3.2模型上验证有效。

Conclusion: 语言身份信息集中在最终层，具有近乎完美的线性可分性，该方法能以可忽略的计算开销缓解代码切换问题，同时保持语义完整性。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit unintended
code-switching, reducing reliability in downstream tasks. We propose
latent-space language steering, a lightweight inference-time method that
identifies language directions via PCA on parallel translations and steers
token embeddings along these axes to control language identity. Our approach
mitigates code-switching while preserving semantics with negligible
computational overhead and requires only minimal parallel data for calibration.
Empirically, we achieve 95-99\% language classification accuracy using a single
principal component and reduce next-token distributional divergence by up to
42% across multiple language pairs on Qwen2.5 and Llama-3.2 models. We further
analyze the layer-wise evolution of language representations, revealing that
language identity concentrates in final layers with near-perfect linear
separability.

*Minju Gwak,Guijin Son,Jaehyung Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文发现成功的LLM推理具有全局非均匀的信息密度特征，这与人类沟通模式形成鲜明对比，挑战了机器推理的现有假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受心理语言学中均匀信息密度假说的启发，研究者希望分析LLM推理过程中的信息流，因为现有CoT推理的中间步骤常常不忠实或难以解释。

Method: 引入基于熵的指标来分析推理轨迹中的信息流，在三个具有挑战性的数学基准上研究LLM推理的信息密度模式。

Result: 发现成功的LLM推理在全局上是非均匀的：正确解决方案以信息密度的不均匀波动为特征，这与人类沟通模式形成鲜明对比。

Conclusion: 这一结果挑战了关于机器推理的假设，并为设计可解释和自适应推理模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often solve problems using step-by-step
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, yet these intermediate steps are frequently
unfaithful or hard to interpret. Inspired by the Uniform Information Density
(UID) hypothesis in psycholinguistics -- which posits that humans communicate
by maintaining a stable flow of information -- we introduce entropy-based
metrics to analyze the information flow within reasoning traces. Surprisingly,
across three challenging mathematical benchmarks, we find that successful
reasoning in LLMs is globally non-uniform: correct solutions are characterized
by uneven swings in information density, in stark contrast to human
communication patterns. This result challenges assumptions about machine
reasoning and suggests new directions for designing interpretable and adaptive
reasoning models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EvoEdit是一种新的语言模型编辑方法，通过顺序零空间对齐来缓解灾难性干扰，实现稳定高效的模型编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型编辑方法在顺序编辑场景中存在灾难性干扰问题，新编辑会破坏先前集成的更新和保留的知识。

Method: 采用顺序零空间对齐策略，为每个传入编辑执行零空间对齐，保留原始和先前修改的知识表示。

Result: 在真实世界顺序知识编辑基准测试中，EvoEdit达到或优于现有最先进方法，速度提升达3.53倍。

Conclusion: 研究强调了为动态演化信息环境设计更原则性LLM方法的必要性，同时提供了一个简单有效且具有强理论保证的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require continual updates to rectify outdated or
erroneous knowledge. Model editing has emerged as a compelling paradigm for
introducing targeted modifications without the computational burden of full
retraining. Existing approaches are mainly based on a locate-then-edit
framework. However, in sequential editing contexts, where multiple updates are
applied over time, they exhibit significant limitations and suffer from
catastrophic interference, i.e., new edits compromise previously integrated
updates and degrade preserved knowledge. To address these challenges, we
introduce EvoEdit, a novel editing strategy that mitigates catastrophic
interference through sequential null-space alignment, enabling stable and
efficient model editing. By performing sequential null-space alignment for each
incoming edit, EvoEdit preserves both original and previously modified
knowledge representations and maintains output invariance on preserved
knowledge even across long edit sequences, effectively mitigating interference.
Evaluations on real-world sequential knowledge-editing benchmarks show that
EvoEdit achieves better or comparable performance than prior state-of-the-art
locate-then-edit techniques, with up to 3.53 times speedup. Overall, these
results underscore the necessity of developing more principled approaches for
designing LLMs in dynamically evolving information settings, while providing a
simple yet effective solution with strong theoretical guarantees.

*Peter Banyas,Shristi Sharma,Alistair Simmons,Atharva Vispute*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConsistencyAI是一个独立基准，用于测量大型语言模型对不同人物角色的回答事实一致性。研究发现不同LLM的事实一致性存在显著差异，且受提供商和话题影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估当不同用户询问相同问题时，LLM是否会产生事实不一致的回答，提供公正的评估和问责机制。

Method: 使用19个LLM，为15个话题请求5个事实，每个LLM重复查询100次，每次添加不同人物角色提示。通过句子嵌入计算跨角色余弦相似度，计算加权平均得到事实一致性分数。

Result: 在100个角色实验中，分数范围0.9065-0.7896，平均0.8656作为基准阈值。Grok-3最一致，轻量级模型最差。话题间一致性差异明显：就业市场最不一致，G7领导人最一致。

Conclusion: LLM的事实一致性既受提供商影响，也受话题影响。需要开发人物角色不变的提示策略来改善一致性。

Abstract: Is an LLM telling you different facts than it's telling me? This paper
introduces ConsistencyAI, an independent benchmark for measuring the factual
consistency of large language models (LLMs) for different personas.
ConsistencyAI tests whether, when users of different demographics ask identical
questions, the model responds with factually inconsistent answers. Designed
without involvement from LLM providers, this benchmark offers impartial
evaluation and accountability. In our experiment, we queried 19 LLMs with
prompts that requested 5 facts for each of 15 topics. We repeated this query
100 times for each LLM, each time adding prompt context from a different
persona selected from a subset of personas modeling the general population. We
processed the responses into sentence embeddings, computed cross-persona cosine
similarity, and computed the weighted average of cross-persona cosine
similarity to calculate factual consistency scores. In 100-persona experiments,
scores ranged from 0.9065 to 0.7896, and the mean was 0.8656, which we adopt as
a benchmark threshold. xAI's Grok-3 is most consistent, while several
lightweight models rank lowest. Consistency varies by topic: the job market is
least consistent, G7 world leaders most consistent, and issues like vaccines or
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict diverge by provider. These results show that
both the provider and the topic shape the factual consistency. We release our
code and interactive demo to support reproducible evaluation and encourage
persona-invariant prompting strategies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了BenchPress系统，通过检索增强生成和LLMs加速领域特定文本到SQL基准的创建，减少人工标注时间和成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到SQL研究主要关注公开数据集，但在私有企业数据仓库中效果不佳。手动标注SQL日志以构建基准既耗时又昂贵

Method: 使用检索增强生成和LLMs为给定SQL查询生成多个自然语言描述，然后由人类专家选择、排序或编辑以确保准确性和领域对齐

Result: 在标注的企业SQL日志上评估显示，LLM辅助标注大幅减少了创建高质量基准的时间和精力，提高了标注准确性和基准可靠性

Conclusion: BenchPress通过结合人类验证和LLM生成建议，为研究人员和从业者提供了评估领域特定文本到SQL模型的机制

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been successfully applied to many tasks,
including text-to-SQL generation. However, much of this work has focused on
publicly available datasets, such as Fiben, Spider, and Bird. Our earlier work
showed that LLMs are much less effective in querying large private enterprise
data warehouses and released Beaver, the first private enterprise text-to-SQL
benchmark. To create Beaver, we leveraged SQL logs, which are often readily
available. However, manually annotating these logs to identify which natural
language questions they answer is a daunting task. Asking database
administrators, who are highly trained experts, to take on additional work to
construct and validate corresponding natural language utterances is not only
challenging but also quite costly. To address this challenge, we introduce
BenchPress, a human-in-the-loop system designed to accelerate the creation of
domain-specific text-to-SQL benchmarks. Given a SQL query, BenchPress uses
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and LLMs to propose multiple natural
language descriptions. Human experts then select, rank, or edit these drafts to
ensure accuracy and domain alignment. We evaluated BenchPress on annotated
enterprise SQL logs, demonstrating that LLM-assisted annotation drastically
reduces the time and effort required to create high-quality benchmarks. Our
results show that combining human verification with LLM-generated suggestions
enhances annotation accuracy, benchmark reliability, and model evaluation
robustness. By streamlining the creation of custom benchmarks, BenchPress
offers researchers and practitioners a mechanism for assessing text-to-SQL
models on a given domain-specific workload. BenchPress is freely available via
our public GitHub repository at
https://github.com/fabian-wenz/enterprise-txt2sql and is also accessible on our

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: R2T框架将语言规则融入神经网络训练目标，通过自适应损失函数处理OOV词汇，在无标注文本上训练的Zarma词性标注模型达到98.2%准确率，优于基于300标注句子的AfriBERTa。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出原则性学习范式，让模型通过显式任务约束而非仅依赖标注数据进行训练，特别针对低资源语言处理问题。

Method: 开发Rule-to-Tag框架，将多层次语言规则集成到神经网络训练目标中，包含处理OOV词汇的自适应损失函数和正则化项。

Result: 在Zarma词性标注任务上，仅使用无标注文本训练的R2T-BiLSTM模型达到98.2%准确率；在命名实体识别任务中，R2T预训练模型仅需50标注句子即可超越基于300标注句子的基线模型。

Conclusion: R2T框架在低资源语言处理中表现出色，证明了原则性学习范式的有效性，能够显著减少对标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: We introduce the Rule-to-Tag (R2T) framework, a hybrid approach that
integrates a multi-tiered system of linguistic rules directly into a neural
network's training objective. R2T's novelty lies in its adaptive loss function,
which includes a regularization term that teaches the model to handle
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words with principled uncertainty. We frame this work
as a case study in a paradigm we call principled learning (PrL), where models
are trained with explicit task constraints rather than on labeled examples
alone. Our experiments on Zarma part-of-speech (POS) tagging show that the
R2T-BiLSTM model, trained only on unlabeled text, achieves 98.2% accuracy,
outperforming baselines like AfriBERTa fine-tuned on 300 labeled sentences. We
further show that for more complex tasks like named entity recognition (NER),
R2T serves as a powerful pre-training step; a model pre-trained with R2T and
fine-tuned on just 50 labeled sentences outperformes a baseline trained on 300.

TL;DR: CoRE是一个即插即用的技术，通过利用模型一致性来提高LLM集成的鲁棒性，解决了异构分词方案和模型能力差异导致的错误信号问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同LLM具有不同的优势和弱点，集成方法可以整合它们的互补能力。然而现有研究很少关注集成对潜在错误信号的鲁棒性，这些错误信号通常源于异构分词方案和模型专业知识的差异。

Method: CoRE从两个层面利用模型一致性：1）词元级一致性通过低通滤波器降低高不一致性词元的权重；2）模型级一致性通过促进高自信度且与其他模型差异小的模型输出来增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个基准测试、模型组合和集成策略上的广泛实验表明，CoRE能够持续提升集成性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CoRE作为一种即插即用的技术，能够与多种集成方法无缝集成，有效提高LLM集成的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Different large language models (LLMs) exhibit diverse strengths and
weaknesses, and LLM ensemble serves as a promising approach to integrate their
complementary capabilities. Despite substantial progress in improving ensemble
quality, limited attention has been paid to the robustness of ensembles against
potential erroneous signals, which often arise from heterogeneous tokenization
schemes and varying model expertise. Our analysis shows that ensemble failures
typically arise from both the token level and the model level: the former
reflects severe disagreement in token predictions, while the latter involves
low confidence and pronounced disparities among models. In light of this, we
propose CoRE, a plug-and-play technique that harnesses model consistency for
robust LLM ensemble, which can be seamlessly integrated with diverse ensemble
methods. Token-level consistency captures fine-grained disagreements by
applying a low-pass filter to downweight uncertain tokens with high
inconsistency, often due to token misalignment, thereby improving robustness at
a granular level. Model-level consistency models global agreement by promoting
model outputs with high self-confidence and minimal divergence from others,
enhancing robustness at a coarser level. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks, model combinations, and ensemble strategies demonstrate that CoRE
consistently improves ensemble performance and robustness.

Motivation: 解决医疗视觉问答(MedVQA)中伤口护理的挑战，支持临床决策和患者护理，需要生成自由文本回答和结构化伤口属性。

Method: 采用通用领域指令调优大语言模型，结合检索增强生成(RAG)框架，融入领域内文本和视觉示例，无需额外训练或复杂重排序。

Result: 在19个团队51个提交中排名第3，平均得分41.37%，在dBLEU、ROUGE、BERTScore和基于LLM的指标上表现优异。

Conclusion: 轻量级RAG与通用LLM结合，通过简单索引和融合添加相关示例，为多模态临床NLP任务提供了简单有效的基线方法。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) enables natural language queries
over medical images to support clinical decision-making and patient care. The
MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addressed wound-care VQA, requiring systems to
generate free-text responses and structured wound attributes from images and
patient queries. We present the MasonNLP system, which employs a
general-domain, instruction-tuned large language model with a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that incorporates textual and
visual examples from in-domain data. This approach grounds outputs in
clinically relevant exemplars, improving reasoning, schema adherence, and
response quality across dBLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and LLM-based metrics. Our
best-performing system ranked 3rd among 19 teams and 51 submissions with an
average score of 41.37%, demonstrating that lightweight RAG with
general-purpose LLMs -- a minimal inference-time layer that adds a few relevant
exemplars via simple indexing and fusion, with no extra training or complex
re-ranking -- provides a simple and effective baseline for multimodal clinical
NLP tasks.

TL;DR: ShishuLM是一种高效的语言模型架构，通过减少参数数量和KV缓存需求，在保持性能的同时显著降低内存占用和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有transformer模型存在显著的内存和计算开销，研究表明这些模型存在架构冗余，为优化提供了机会。

Method: 基于AI可解释性和推理时层剪枝的研究，将transformer块近似为多层感知机(MLP)，减少KV缓存需求。

Result: 在中等上下文场景下，ShishuLM相比父模型减少25%内存需求，提升40%训练和推理延迟。

Conclusion: 该研究为从预训练角度构建更高效的小型语言模型架构提供了见解。

Abstract: While the transformer architecture has achieved state-of-the-art performance
on natural language processing tasks, these models impose substantial memory
and computational overhead. Recent research has identified significant
architectural redundancies within these models, presenting opportunities for
optimization without compromising performance. Taking insights from research in
AI interpretability and inference-time layer pruning, we introduce an efficient
language model architecture, referred to as ShishuLM, which reduces both the
parameter count and Key-Value (KV) cache requirements. Given the increasing
importance of Small Language Models (SLMs) in agentic AI systems, we evaluate
our approach on two SLMs of different scales. Our analysis reveals that for
moderate-context scenarios, normalization coupled with attention computation is
roughly linear with the input, enabling entire transformer blocks to be
approximated through Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Our results show that
ShishuLM provides up to 25% reduction in memory requirements and up to 40%
improvement in latency during both training and inference, compared to parent
models. Our experimental and analytical findings provide insights towards
building more efficient SLM architectures from a pre-training standpoint.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了首个集成LLM框架，用于大规模感知辅导对话中的情感动态，分析了16,986个对话轮次，发现学生在与AI导师互动时通常表现出轻度积极情感和中等唤醒度，但学习过程并非一帆风顺。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已有研究探讨了LLM在教育环境中的学习影响，但LLM介导的辅导中的情感动态仍未得到充分理解。本研究旨在通过关注学习者不断变化的情感状态，推进将生成式AI负责任地整合到教育中的路径。

Method: 分析了两个学期内261名本科生与PyTutor AI导师的16,986个对话轮次，使用三种前沿LLM（Gemini、GPT-4o、Claude）进行零样本情感标注，包括效价、唤醒度和学习帮助性的标量评分以及自由文本情感标签，通过排名加权模型内池化和跨模型多数共识融合估计值。

Result: 学生通常报告轻度积极情感和中等唤醒度；困惑和好奇是解决问题的常见伴随情绪；挫折感虽然较少出现但仍会阻碍进展；情感状态短暂存在，积极时刻稍长但易受干扰；负面情绪常快速解决，有时直接反弹为积极状态；中性时刻常作为转折点，更多引导向上而非向下。

Conclusion: 中性时刻为导师干预提供了关键机会点，情感动态的深入理解有助于优化AI辅导系统，确保生成式AI在教育中的负责任整合。

Abstract: While recent studies have examined the leaning impact of large language model
(LLM) in educational contexts, the affective dynamics of LLM-mediated tutoring
remain insufficiently understood. This work introduces the first ensemble-LLM
framework for large-scale affect sensing in tutoring dialogues, advancing the
conversation on responsible pathways for integrating generative AI into
education by attending to learners' evolving affective states. To achieve this,
we analyzed two semesters' worth of 16,986 conversational turns exchanged
between PyTutor, an LLM-powered AI tutor, and 261 undergraduate learners across
three U.S. institutions. To investigate learners' emotional experiences, we
generate zero-shot affect annotations from three frontier LLMs (Gemini, GPT-4o,
Claude), including scalar ratings of valence, arousal, and
learning-helpfulness, along with free-text emotion labels. These estimates are
fused through rank-weighted intra-model pooling and plurality consensus across
models to produce robust emotion profiles. Our analysis shows that during
interaction with the AI tutor, students typically report mildly positive affect
and moderate arousal. Yet learning is not uniformly smooth: confusion and
curiosity are frequent companions to problem solving, and frustration, while
less common, still surfaces in ways that can derail progress. Emotional states
are short-lived--positive moments last slightly longer than neutral or negative
ones, but they are fragile and easily disrupted. Encouragingly, negative
emotions often resolve quickly, sometimes rebounding directly into positive
states. Neutral moments frequently act as turning points, more often steering
students upward than downward, suggesting opportunities for tutors to intervene
at precisely these junctures.

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，相比基线方法取得了17.01%的稳定提升，并在多token生成场景中实现了有效的加速。

Conclusion: TI方法为扩散语言模型提供了专门定制的条件化生成策略，显著提升了性能并保持了生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to
Autoregressive Language Models, yet their inference strategies remain limited
to prefix-based prompting inherited from the autoregressive paradigm. In this
paper, we propose Template Infilling (TI), a tailored conditioning methodology
for DLMs' generation process. Unlike conventional prefix prompting, TI first
generates a structural template for the target response, then fills in the
masked segments. To enhance the flexibility of this structural control, we
introduce Dynamic Segment Allocation (DSA), which adaptively adjusts segment
lengths based on generation confidence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks, achieving
consistent improvements of 17.01$\%$p over baseline. Furthermore, we show that
TI provides additional advantages in multi-token generation settings, enabling
effective speedup while maintaining generation quality.

Result: 在长形式推理任务中节省高达15%计算成本同时保持90%以上基线准确率；在指令调优模型中，在完全计算时获得准确率提升，在50%节省时匹配基线质量。

Conclusion: GateSkip提供了一种稳定有效的层跳过方法，学习的门控机制揭示了transformer信息流模式，并能与量化、剪枝和自推测解码等技术轻松结合。

Abstract: We introduce GateSkip, a simple residual-stream gating mechanism that enables
token-wise layer skipping in decoder-only LMs. Each Attention/MLP branch is
equipped with a sigmoid-linear gate that condenses the branch's output before
it re-enters the residual stream. During inference we rank tokens by the gate
values and skip low-importance ones using a per-layer budget. While early-exit
or router-based Mixture-of-Depths models are known to be unstable and need
extensive retraining, our smooth, differentiable gates fine-tune stably on top
of pretrained models. On long-form reasoning, we save up to 15\% compute while
retaining over 90\% of baseline accuracy. On instruction-tuned models we see
accuracy gains at full compute and match baseline quality near 50\% savings.
The learned gates give insight into transformer information flow (e.g., BOS
tokens act as anchors), and the method combines easily with quantization,
pruning, and self-speculative decoding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个纯文本反馈的多臂老虎机基准测试，评估LLMs在不确定性下的顺序决策能力，发现Qwen3-4B模型在最佳臂选择率上达到89.2%，显著优于其他LLMs和传统算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs仅使用自然语言在不确定性下进行顺序决策的能力，这在当前研究中尚未充分探索。

Method: 引入纯文本反馈的多臂老虎机环境，LLMs仅通过"你获得了一个代币"这样的文本反馈来推断潜在奖励结构，并与Thompson Sampling、Epsilon Greedy、UCB等传统算法进行比较。

Result: 大多数LLMs表现不如基线算法，但Qwen3-4B模型取得了89.2%的最佳臂选择率，显著优于更大的LLMs和传统方法。

Conclusion: 概率推理能力能够仅从语言中涌现，该基准测试为评估自然主义、非数值上下文中的决策能力迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown to be increasingly capable of
performing reasoning tasks, but their ability to make sequential decisions
under uncertainty only using natural language remains underexplored. We
introduce a novel benchmark in which LLMs interact with multi-armed bandit
environments using purely textual feedback, "you earned a token", without
access to numerical cues or explicit probabilities, resulting in the model to
infer latent reward structures purely off linguistic cues and to adapt
accordingly. We evaluated the performance of four open-source LLMs and compare
their performance to standard decision-making algorithms such as Thompson
Sampling, Epsilon Greedy, Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), and random choice.
While most of the LLMs underperformed compared to the baselines, Qwen3-4B,
achieved the best-arm selection rate of 89.2% , which significantly
outperformed both the larger LLMs and traditional methods. Our findings suggest
that probabilistic reasoning is able to emerge from language alone, and we
present this benchmark as a step towards evaluating decision-making
capabilities in naturalistic, non-numeric contexts.

*Alexandre Galashov,Matt Jones,Rosemary Ke,Yuan Cao,Vaishnavh Nagarajan,Michael C. Mozer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种让语言模型动态自主调整每个输入token计算步数的方法，通过<don't know>输出请求额外计算资源，使用<pause>token提供更多计算时间，从而在准确性和计算效率之间取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言模型对所有token使用相同的计算资源，但不同token的复杂性差异很大。该研究旨在让模型能够根据token的复杂性动态调整计算资源，在需要时请求更多计算时间以提高准确性。

Method: 提出了Catch Your Breath损失函数类别，包括三种方法：CYB-AP（随时预测）、CYB-VA（变分方法）和CYB-DP（计算预算惩罚）。模型通过输出<don't know>请求暂停，获得<pause>token提供的额外计算资源。

Result: CYB模型仅需基线模型三分之一的训练数据就能达到相同性能，比带暂停的交叉熵损失模型少用一半数据。模型能够根据token复杂性自适应调整处理时间，例如在复数名词后暂停，在缩略词首token后不暂停。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了语言模型对计算资源的动态分配，模型能够智能地请求额外计算步骤来提高准确性，同时显著减少了训练数据需求，展示了在计算效率和准确性之间的有效平衡。

Abstract: We explore a class of supervised training objectives that allow a language
model to dynamically and autonomously scale the number of compute steps used
for each input token. For any token, the model can request additional compute
steps by emitting a <don't know> output. If the model is granted a delay, a
specialized <pause> token is inserted at the next input step, providing the
model with additional compute resources to generate an output. The model can
request multiple pauses. To train the model to use <don't know> outputs
judiciously and to calibrate its uncertainty, we frame the selection of each
output token as a sequential-decision problem with a time cost. We refer to the
class of methods as $\textit{Catch Your Breath}$ losses and we study three
methods in this class: CYB-AP frames the model's task as anytime prediction,
where an output may be required at any step and accuracy is discounted over
time; CYB-VA is a variational approach that aims to maximize prediction
accuracy subject to a specified distribution over stopping times; and CYB-DP
imposes a penalty based on a computational budget. Through fine-tuning
experiments, we identify the best performing loss variant. The CYB model needs
only one third as much training data as the baseline (no pause) model needs to
achieve the same performance, and half as much data as a model with pauses and
a cross-entropy loss. We find that the CYB model requests additional steps when
doing so improves accuracy, and the model adapts its processing time to
token-level complexity and context. For example, it often pauses after plural
nouns like $\textit{patients}$ and $\textit{challenges}$ but never pauses after
the first token of contracted words like $\textit{wasn}$ and $\textit{didn}$,
and it shows high variability for ambiguous tokens like $\textit{won}$, which
could function as either a verb or part of a contraction.

Abstract: In recent years, natural language generative models have shown outstanding
performance in text generation tasks. However, when facing specific tasks or
particular requirements, they may exhibit poor performance or require
adjustments that demand large amounts of additional data. This work introduces
PAGE (Prompt Augmentation for text Generation Enhancement), a framework
designed to assist these models through the use of simple auxiliary modules.
These modules, lightweight models such as classifiers or extractors, provide
inferences from the input text. The output of these auxiliaries is then used to
construct an enriched input that improves the quality and controllability of
the generation. Unlike other generation-assistance approaches, PAGE does not
require auxiliary generative models; instead, it proposes a simpler, modular
architecture that is easy to adapt to different tasks. This paper presents the
proposal, its components and architecture, and reports a proof of concept in
the domain of requirements engineering, where an auxiliary module with a
classifier is used to improve the quality of software requirements generation.

TL;DR: 本文主张在LLM社会模拟中采用开放式文本生成方法，而非传统的封闭式多选或简答格式，以更好地捕捉真实社会现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM社会模拟大多采用封闭式设计，忽视了LLM的生成性本质，无法充分模拟真实社会意见的多样性和复杂性。

Method: 基于调查方法学和NLP进展，提出开放式文本生成框架，允许LLM自由表达观点、主题和推理过程。

Result: 开放式方法能改进测量和设计，探索意外观点，减少研究者偏见，捕捉表达性和个体差异，并增强方法论效用。

Conclusion: 呼吁开发新的实践和评估框架，充分利用LLM的生成多样性，促进NLP与社会科学的协同发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate public opinion
and other social phenomena. Most current studies constrain these simulations to
multiple-choice or short-answer formats for ease of scoring and comparison, but
such closed designs overlook the inherently generative nature of LLMs. In this
position paper, we argue that open-endedness, using free-form text that
captures topics, viewpoints, and reasoning processes "in" LLMs, is essential
for realistic social simulation. Drawing on decades of survey-methodology
research and recent advances in NLP, we argue why this open-endedness is
valuable in LLM social simulations, showing how it can improve measurement and
design, support exploration of unanticipated views, and reduce
researcher-imposed directive bias. It also captures expressiveness and
individuality, aids in pretesting, and ultimately enhances methodological
utility. We call for novel practices and evaluation frameworks that leverage
rather than constrain the open-ended generative diversity of LLMs, creating
synergies between NLP and social science.

<details>

Motivation: 评估当代大语言模型在非结构化文本分类任务中的实际性能，了解其局限性和改进方向。

Method: 使用统一的8,660个人工标注样本和相同的零样本提示，评估10个LLMs在IAB 2.2层次分类体系下的表现，采用经典指标和LLM特定指标。

Result: 当代LLMs平均准确率34%，精确率42%，召回率45%，F1分数41%；存在较高幻觉和过度分类；Gemini和GPT系列表现较好；集成方法能显著提升准确率并消除幻觉。

Conclusion: 单纯扩大模型规模和架构改进不能确保更好的分类性能，模型协调集成可能是实现超越人类专家性能的最有效途径。

Abstract: This study presents a comparative evaluation of ten state-of-the-art large
language models (LLMs) applied to unstructured text categorization using the
Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) 2.2 hierarchical taxonomy. The analysis
employed a uniform dataset of 8,660 human-annotated samples and identical
zero-shot prompts to ensure methodological consistency across all models.
Evaluation metrics included four classic measures - accuracy, precision,
recall, and F1-score - and three LLM-specific indicators: hallucination ratio,
inflation ratio, and categorization cost.
  Results show that, despite their rapid advancement, contemporary LLMs achieve
only moderate classic performance, with average scores of 34% accuracy, 42%
precision, 45% recall, and 41% F1-score. Hallucination and inflation ratios
reveal that models frequently overproduce categories relative to human
annotators. Among the evaluated systems, Gemini 1.5/2.0 Flash and GPT 20B/120B
offered the most favorable cost-to-performance balance, while GPT 120B
demonstrated the lowest hallucination ratio. The findings suggest that scaling
and architectural improvements alone do not ensure better categorization
accuracy, as the task requires compressing rich unstructured text into a
limited taxonomy - a process that challenges current model architectures.
  To address these limitations, a separate ensemble-based approach was
developed and tested. The ensemble method, in which multiple LLMs act as
independent experts, substantially improved accuracy, reduced inflation, and
completely eliminated hallucinations. These results indicate that coordinated
orchestration of models - rather than sheer scale - may represent the most
effective path toward achieving or surpassing human-expert performance in
large-scale text categorization.

Method: 开发了ProofBench专家标注数据集，包含145个数学竞赛问题和435个LLM生成的解决方案；系统探索评估器设计空间，结合强推理骨干模型、参考解决方案和评分方案的丰富上下文，以及简单的集成方法。

Result: ProofGrader评估器在专家评分上实现了0.926的MAE，显著优于朴素基线；在最佳n选择任务中，当n=16时平均得分为4.14（满分7），填补了朴素二元评估器（2.48）与人类专家（4.62）之间78%的差距。

Conclusion: ProofGrader证明了其在细粒度评估LLM生成数学证明方面的有效性，具有推动下游证明生成的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) for mathematical reasoning
have largely focused on tasks with easily verifiable final answers; however,
generating and verifying natural language math proofs remains an open
challenge. We identify the absence of a reliable, fine-grained evaluator for
LLM-generated math proofs as a critical gap. To address this, we propose a
systematic methodology for developing and validating evaluators that assign
fine-grained scores on a 0-7 scale to model-generated math proofs. To enable
this study, we introduce ProofBench, the first expert-annotated dataset of
fine-grained proof ratings, spanning 145 problems from six major math
competitions (USAMO, IMO, Putnam, etc) and 435 LLM-generated solutions from
Gemini-2.5-pro, o3, and DeepSeek-R1. %with expert gradings. Using ProofBench as
a testbed, we systematically explore the evaluator design space across key
axes: the backbone model, input context, instructions and evaluation workflow.
Our analysis delivers ProofGrader, an evaluator that combines a strong
reasoning backbone LM, rich context from reference solutions and marking
schemes, and a simple ensembling method; it achieves a low Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) of 0.926 against expert scores, significantly outperforming naive
baselines. Finally, we demonstrate its practical utility in a best-of-$n$
selection task: at $n=16$, ProofGrader achieves an average score of 4.14 (out
of 7), closing 78% of the gap between a naive binary evaluator (2.48) and the
human oracle (4.62), highlighting its potential to advance downstream proof
generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced many domains and applications but
face high fine-tuning costs, inference latency, limited edge deployability, and
reliability concerns. Small language models (SLMs), compact, efficient, and

frameworks that fuse SLMs' specialization and efficiency with LLMs'
generalization and reasoning to meet diverse objectives across tasks and
deployment scenarios. Motivated by these developments, this paper presents a
systematic survey of SLM-LLM collaboration organized by collaboration
objectives. We propose a taxonomy with four goals: performance enhancement,
cost-effectiveness, cloud-edge privacy, and trustworthiness. Within this
framework, we review representative methods, summarize design paradigms, and
outline open challenges and future directions toward efficient, secure, and
scalable SLM-LLM collaboration.

Conclusion: THTB在数据选择和标注指导方面表现出色，具有强大的领域适应潜力，为高效SFT提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general tasks, but adapting them to
specialized domains relies on high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data.
Although existing methods can identify subsets of high-quality data and reduce
training cost to some extent, their selection process still suffers from
over-reliance on LLMs' internal knowledge, weak interpretability, and limited
generalization. To address these limitations, we propose THTB (The Harder The
Better), a cognitive science-inspired framework for instruction data selection
and annotation guidance. THTB prioritizes higher-level cognitive instructions
by combining quality filtering with intrinsic and extrinsic hardness scoring,
offering interpretable and quantifiable criteria for efficient SFT, both in
data selection and annotation guidance. Experiments show that THTB enables
models trained on only 5% of the data to outperform full-dataset training,
while achieving superior generalization compared with LLM-only selection. In
addition, THTB provides effective annotation guidance in vertical domains,
enabling a model trained on just 2% of the data to surpass models trained on
much larger datasets, demonstrating strong potential for domain adaptation. Our
code, datasets, and models are available on

Motivation: 现有防御方法主要关注单轮攻击，缺乏跨语言覆盖，且分类法有限，无法全面捕捉攻击策略的多样性。需要更深入地理解越狱技术的有效性。

Method: 通过结构化红队挑战开发了包含7大类50种策略的层次化分类法，分析了挑战数据中不同攻击类型的流行度和成功率，评估了基于分类法的提示方法对自动检测的改进效果。

Result: 开发了全面的越狱策略分类法，包含7大类策略；分析了不同攻击策略的成功率和模型漏洞利用方式；验证了分类法指导的提示能改善自动检测；创建了多轮对抗对话数据集。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解越狱技术有效性提供了系统框架，分类法指导的方法能提升检测能力，多轮对话数据集支持研究逐步出现的对抗意图如何绕过传统防护。

Abstract: Jailbreaking techniques pose a significant threat to the safety of Large
Language Models (LLMs). Existing defenses typically focus on single-turn
attacks, lack coverage across languages, and rely on limited taxonomies that
either fail to capture the full diversity of attack strategies or emphasize
risk categories rather than the jailbreaking techniques. To advance the
understanding of the effectiveness of jailbreaking techniques, we conducted a
structured red-teaming challenge. The outcome of our experiments are manifold.
First, we developed a comprehensive hierarchical taxonomy of 50 jailbreak
strategies, consolidating and extending prior classifications into seven broad
families, including impersonation, persuasion, privilege escalation, cognitive
overload, obfuscation, goal conflict, and data poisoning. Second, we analyzed
the data collected from the challenge to examine the prevalence and success
rates of different attack types, providing insights into how specific jailbreak
strategies exploit model vulnerabilities and induce misalignment. Third, we
benchmark a popular LLM for jailbreak detection, evaluating the benefits of
taxonomy-guided prompting for improving automatic detection. Finally, we
compiled a new Italian dataset of 1364 multi-turn adversarial dialogues,
annotated with our taxonomy, enabling the study of interactions where
adversarial intent emerges gradually and succeeds in bypassing traditional
safeguards.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型生成的文本质量接近人类写作，作者归属变得越来越困难，需要开发有效的归属机制来区分人类和AI生成的内容。

Method: 使用固定风格嵌入和指令调优的GPT-4o作为LLM法官，在Human AI Parallel Corpus数据集（包含6个领域600个平衡实例）上进行基准测试。

Result: 风格嵌入在GPT续写上的总体准确率更高（82% vs 68%），而LLM法官在LLaMA续写上稍好（85% vs 81%）。LLM法官在小说和学术散文上表现显著更好，而嵌入在口语和剧本对话中占优势。

Conclusion: 作者归属是一个多维问题，需要混合策略。提供了开源框架和数据集支持可复现性研究。

Abstract: Attributing authorship in the era of large language models (LLMs) is
increasingly challenging as machine-generated prose rivals human writing. We
benchmark two complementary attribution mechanisms , fixed Style Embeddings and
an instruction-tuned LLM judge (GPT-4o) on the Human AI Parallel Corpus, an
open dataset of 600 balanced instances spanning six domains (academic, news,
fiction, blogs, spoken transcripts, and TV/movie scripts). Each instance
contains a human prompt with both a gold continuation and an LLM-generated
continuation from either GPT-4o or LLaMA-70B-Instruct. The Style Embedding
baseline achieves stronger aggregate accuracy on GPT continuations (82 pct vs.
68 pct). The LLM Judge is slightly better than the Style embeddings on LLaMA
continuations (85 pct vs. 81 pct) but the results are not statistically
significant. Crucially, the LLM judge significantly outperforms in fiction and
academic prose, indicating semantic sensitivity, whereas embeddings dominate in
spoken and scripted dialogue, reflecting structural strengths. These
complementary patterns highlight attribution as a multidimensional problem
requiring hybrid strategies. To support reproducibility we provide code on
GitHub and derived data on Hugging Face under the MIT license. This open
framework provides a reproducible benchmark for attribution quality assessment
in AI-generated content, along with a review of related literature influencing

Conclusion: 窄域微调模型在激活中保留训练目标的显著痕迹，这对AI安全研究具有重要启示，需要开发更真实的案例研究。

Abstract: Finetuning on narrow domains has become an essential tool to adapt Large
Language Models (LLMs) to specific tasks and to create models with known
unusual properties that are useful for research. We show that narrow finetuning
creates strong biases in LLM activations that can be interpreted to understand
the finetuning domain. These biases can be discovered using simple tools from
model diffing - the study of differences between models before and after
finetuning. In particular, analyzing activation differences on the first few
tokens of random text and steering by adding this difference to the model
activations produces text similar to the format and general content of the
finetuning data. We demonstrate that these analyses contain crucial information
by creating an LLM-based interpretability agent to understand the finetuning
domain. With access to the bias, the agent performs significantly better
compared to baseline agents using simple prompting. Our analysis spans
synthetic document finetuning for false facts, emergent misalignment,
subliminal learning, and taboo word guessing game models across different
architectures (Gemma, LLaMA, Qwen) and scales (1B to 32B parameters). We
suspect these biases reflect overfitting and find that mixing pretraining data
into the finetuning corpus largely removes them, though residual risks may
remain. Our work (1) demonstrates that narrowly finetuned models have salient
traces of their training objective in their activations and suggests ways to
improve how they are trained, (2) warns AI safety and interpretability
researchers that the common practice of using such models as a proxy for
studying broader finetuning (e.g., chat-tuning) might not be realistic, and (3)
highlights the need for deeper investigation into the effects of narrow
finetuning and development of truly realistic case studies for model-diffing,
safety and interpretability research.

Motivation: 大语言模型在各种任务中表现出色，但仍然容易受到越狱攻击的威胁，需要系统性地探测这些安全漏洞。

Method: RAID将离散令牌松弛为连续嵌入，通过联合目标优化：(1)鼓励受限响应；(2)拒绝感知正则化器引导激活远离拒绝方向；(3)连贯性项保持语义合理性。优化后通过批评引导的解码过程将嵌入映射回令牌。

Result: 在多个开源LLM上的实验表明，RAID比最近的基准方法实现了更高的攻击成功率，同时使用更少的查询和更低的计算成本。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了嵌入空间正则化对于理解和缓解LLM越狱漏洞的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance across diverse
tasks yet remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass safety mechanisms.
We present RAID (Refusal-Aware and Integrated Decoding), a framework that
systematically probes these weaknesses by crafting adversarial suffixes that
induce restricted content while preserving fluency. RAID relaxes discrete
tokens into continuous embeddings and optimizes them with a joint objective
that (i) encourages restricted responses, (ii) incorporates a refusal-aware
regularizer to steer activations away from refusal directions in embedding
space, and (iii) applies a coherence term to maintain semantic plausibility and
non-redundancy. After optimization, a critic-guided decoding procedure maps
embeddings back to tokens by balancing embedding affinity with language-model
likelihood. This integration yields suffixes that are both effective in
bypassing defenses and natural in form. Experiments on multiple open-source
LLMs show that RAID achieves higher attack success rates with fewer queries and
lower computational cost than recent white-box and black-box baselines. These
findings highlight the importance of embedding-space regularization for
understanding and mitigating LLM jailbreak vulnerabilities.

Method: 使用道德基础理论框架，直接比较LLM回应与现有人类研究数据，分析LLM在固有回应、明确政治意识形态表达和人类角色扮演情境下的表现。

Result: 研究发现LLM回应确实表现出意识形态倾向，无论是固有回应还是通过角色扮演，都显示出政治和人口统计依赖性。

Conclusion: LLM在道德和政治回应中存在系统性偏见，需要进一步研究以确保AI系统的公平性和中立性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly incorporated into
everyday life for many internet users, taking on significant roles as advice
givers in the domains of medicine, personal relationships, and even legal
matters. The importance of these roles raise questions about how and what
responses LLMs make in difficult political and moral domains, especially
questions about possible biases. To quantify the nature of potential biases in
LLMs, various works have applied Moral Foundations Theory (MFT), a framework
that categorizes human moral reasoning into five dimensions: Harm, Fairness,
Ingroup Loyalty, Authority, and Purity. Previous research has used the MFT to
measure differences in human participants along political, national, and
cultural lines. While there has been some analysis of the responses of LLM with
respect to political stance in role-playing scenarios, no work so far has
directly assessed the moral leanings in the LLM responses, nor have they
connected LLM outputs with robust human data. In this paper we analyze the
distinctions between LLM MFT responses and existing human research directly,
investigating whether commonly available LLM responses demonstrate ideological
leanings: either through their inherent responses, straightforward
representations of political ideologies, or when responding from the
perspectives of constructed human personas. We assess whether LLMs inherently
generate responses that align more closely with one political ideology over
another, and additionally examine how accurately LLMs can represent ideological
perspectives through both explicit prompting and demographic-based
role-playing. By systematically analyzing LLM behavior across these conditions
and experiments, our study provides insight into the extent of political and
demographic dependency in AI-generated responses.

*Pan Chen,Shaohong Chen,Mark Wang,Shi Xuan Leong,Priscilla Fung,Varinia Bernales,Alan Aspuru-Guzik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了SCHEMA ACTIVATED IN CONTEXT LEARNING (SA-ICL)框架，通过从示例中提取认知构建块的抽象表示来增强语言模型的推理能力，在GPQA数据集上实现了高达36.19%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于示例的上下文学习缺乏知识检索和抽象层面转移的显式模块。受认知科学中图式理论的启发，认为人类通过激活预先存在的心理框架来理解新信息。

Method: SA-ICL从先验示例中提取推理过程的认知构建块表示，创建轻量级、结构化的抽象图式模板，包含关键推理步骤及其关系，用于增强模型处理新问题时的推理过程。

Result: 在GPQA数据集的化学和物理问题上，SA-ICL持续提升性能，当单个演示示例质量较高时，性能提升高达36.19%，同时减少了对演示数量的依赖并增强了可解释性。

Conclusion: SA-ICL不仅连接了从模式启动到思维链提示的不同ICL策略，还为增强LLMs中类人推理开辟了新途径，证明显式图式脚手架显著有益于LLMs。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) enables transformer-based language models to adapt
to new tasks by conditioning on demonstration examples. However, traditional
example-driven in-context learning lacks explicit modules for knowledge
retrieval and transfer at the abstraction level. Inspired by cognitive science,
specifically schema theory, which holds that humans interpret new information
by activating pre-existing mental frameworks (schemas) to structure
understanding, we introduce SCHEMA ACTIVATED IN CONTEXT LEARNING (SA-ICL). This
framework extracts the representation of the building blocks of cognition for
the reasoning process instilled from prior examples, creating an abstracted
schema, a lightweight, structured template of key inferential steps and their
relationships, which is then used to augment a model's reasoning process when
presented with a novel question. We demonstrate that a broad range of large
language models (LLMs) lack the capacity to form and utilize internal
schema-based learning representations implicitly, but instead benefit
significantly from explicit schema-based scaffolding. Across chemistry and
physics questions from the GPQA dataset, our experiments show that SA-ICL
consistently boosts performance, up to 36.19 percent, when the single
demonstration example is of high quality, which simultaneously reduces reliance
on the number of demonstrations and enhances interpretability. SCHEMA ACTIVATED
IN CONTEXT LEARNING not only bridges disparate ICL strategies ranging from
pattern priming to Chain-of-Thought prompting, but also paves a new path for
enhancing human-like reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了Prompt Duel Optimizer (PDO)框架，用于无标签的提示优化，通过两两比较和双Thompson采样来高效优化LLM提示


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动提示优化方法需要真实标签数据，但高质量标签收集成本高且耗时，需要开发无需标签的优化方法

Method: 将问题建模为dueling-bandit设置，使用双Thompson采样选择信息量大的提示比较，结合Top-Performer Guided Mutation扩展候选池

Result: 在BIG-bench Hard和MS MARCO上的实验表明，PDO始终优于基线方法，消融研究验证了D-TS和提示变异的有效性

Conclusion: PDO提供了一种样本高效的无标签提示优化框架，能够有效减少对真实标签的依赖，在无标签和部分标签设置下都能取得良好效果

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to their input prompts,
making prompt design a central challenge. While automatic prompt optimization
(APO) reduces manual engineering, most approaches assume access to ground-truth
references such as labeled validation data. In practice, however, collecting
high-quality labels is costly and slow. We propose the Prompt Duel Optimizer
(PDO), a sample-efficient framework for label-free prompt optimization. PDO
formulates the problem as a dueling-bandit setting, where supervision signal
comes from pairwise preference feedback provided by an LLM judge. The framework
combines Double Thompson Sampling (D-TS), which prioritizes informative prompt
comparisons, with Top-Performer Guided Mutation, which expands the candidate
pool by mutating high-performing prompts. PDO naturally operates in label-free
settings and can also incorporate partial labels to mitigate judge noise.
Experiments on BIG-bench Hard (BBH) and MS MARCO show that PDO consistently
outperforms baseline methods. Ablation studies further demonstrate the
effectiveness of both D-TS and prompt mutation.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了LLaMA 3.2-3B模型是否在其内部表示中编码了算术运算符优先级，通过可解释性技术发现中间计算结果存在于残差流中，并提出了部分嵌入交换技术来修改运算符优先级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在算术任务上表现不佳，先前研究主要关注输出或提示策略，而忽略了模型进行算术计算的内部结构机制，特别是运算符优先级的编码方式。

Method: 构建包含三个操作数和两个运算符的算术表达式数据集，应用logit lens、线性分类探针和UMAP几何可视化等可解释性技术，分析模型内部表示，并引入部分嵌入交换技术。

Result: 研究发现中间计算存在于残差流中（特别是在MLP块之后），模型在线性编码每个运算符的嵌入中包含了优先级信息。

Conclusion: LLM确实在内部表示中编码了运算符优先级，这为理解模型算术计算机制提供了新见解，部分嵌入交换技术可用于修改运算符优先级。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities but continue to struggle with arithmetic tasks. Prior works
largely focus on outputs or prompting strategies, leaving the open question of
the internal structure through which models do arithmetic computation. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs encode operator precedence in their internal
representations via the open-source instruction-tuned LLaMA 3.2-3B model. We
constructed a dataset of arithmetic expressions with three operands and two
operators, varying the order and placement of parentheses. Using this dataset,
we trace whether intermediate results appear in the residual stream of the
instruction-tuned LLaMA 3.2-3B model. We apply interpretability techniques such
as logit lens, linear classification probes, and UMAP geometric visualization.
Our results show that intermediate computations are present in the residual
stream, particularly after MLP blocks. We also find that the model linearly
encodes precedence in each operator's embeddings post attention layer. We
introduce partial embedding swap, a technique that modifies operator precedence
by exchanging high-impact embedding dimensions between operators.

Motivation: 现有LLM-based知识图谱推理方法存在两个主要问题：LLM内在知识可能被稀疏的KG上下文所掩盖导致知识失真，以及难以完全约束LLM的生成幻觉，严重影响推理结果的可信度。

Method: 设计知识推理语言指令格式和分词器对齐LLM知识与KG表示；提出KRL注意力层通过动态知识记忆机制协调内在LLM知识与额外KG上下文；设计结构感知的下一个实体预测器将推理结果严格约束在可信知识域内。

Result: 在25个真实世界归纳KGR数据集上的实验结果表明，KRLM在零样本推理和微调场景中均表现出显著优势。

Conclusion: KRLM通过统一协调LLM知识与KG上下文，有效解决了LLM知识失真和生成幻觉问题，显著提升了归纳知识图谱推理的性能和可信度。

Abstract: Inductive Knowledge Graph Reasoning (KGR) aims to discover facts in
open-domain KGs containing unknown entities and relations, which poses a
challenge for KGR models in comprehending uncertain KG components. Existing
studies have proposed Knowledge Graph Foundation Models (KGFMs) that learn
structural invariances across KGs to handle this uncertainty. Recently, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities for open-domain
knowledge reasoning. As a result, the latest research has focused on LLM-based
KGFMs that integrate LLM knowledge with KG context for inductive KGR. However,
the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs may be overshadowed by sparse KG context,
leading to LLM knowledge distortion, which can cause irreversible damage to
model reasoning. Moreover, existing LLM-based KGR methods still struggle to
fully constrain generative hallucinations in LLMs, severely limiting the
credibility of reasoning results. To address these limitations, we propose a
Knowledge Reasoning Language Model (KRLM) that achieves unified coordination
between LLM knowledge and KG context throughout the KGR process. Specifically,
we design a Knowledge Reasoning Language (KRL) instruction format and a KRL
tokenizer to align LLM knowledge with KG representations. Then, we propose a
KRL attention layer that coordinates intrinsic LLM knowledge with additional KG
context through a dynamic knowledge memory mechanism. Finally, a
structure-aware next-entity predictor is proposed, which strictly constrains
the reasoning results within a trustworthy knowledge domain. Extensive
experimental results on 25 real-world inductive KGR datasets demonstrate the
significant superiority of the proposed KRLM\footnote{Our source codes are
available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/KRLM-EA36 in both zero-shot

Conclusion: 增强中间能力对提升代理式RAG系统性能至关重要，RAGCap-Bench为评估这些能力提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates key limitations of Large
Language Models (LLMs)-such as factual errors, outdated knowledge, and
hallucinations-by dynamically retrieving external information. Recent work
extends this paradigm through agentic RAG systems, where LLMs act as agents to
iteratively plan, retrieve, and reason over complex queries. However, these
systems still struggle with challenging multi-hop questions, and their
intermediate reasoning capabilities remain underexplored. To address this, we
propose RAGCap-Bench, a capability-oriented benchmark for fine-grained
evaluation of intermediate tasks in agentic RAG workflows. We analyze outputs
from state-of-the-art systems to identify common tasks and the core
capabilities required for their execution, then construct a taxonomy of typical
LLM errors to design targeted evaluation questions. Experiments show that
"slow-thinking" models with stronger RAGCap performance achieve better
end-to-end results, underscoring the benchmark's validity and the importance of
enhancing these intermediate capabilities.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The core premise of AI debate as a scalable oversight technique is that it is
harder to lie convincingly than to refute a lie, enabling the judge to identify
the correct position. Yet, existing debate experiments have relied on datasets
with ground truth, where lying is reduced to defending an incorrect
proposition. This overlooks a subjective dimension: lying also requires the
belief that the claim defended is false. In this work, we apply debate to
subjective questions and explicitly measure large language models' prior
beliefs before experiments. Debaters were asked to select their preferred
position, then presented with a judge persona deliberately designed to conflict
with their identified priors. This setup tested whether models would adopt
sycophantic strategies, aligning with the judge's presumed perspective to
maximize persuasiveness, or remain faithful to their prior beliefs. We
implemented and compared two debate protocols, sequential and simultaneous, to
evaluate potential systematic biases. Finally, we assessed whether models were
more persuasive and produced higher-quality arguments when defending positions
consistent with their prior beliefs versus when arguing against them. Our main
findings show that models tend to prefer defending stances aligned with the
judge persona rather than their prior beliefs, sequential debate introduces
significant bias favoring the second debater, models are more persuasive when
defending positions aligned with their prior beliefs, and paradoxically,
arguments misaligned with prior beliefs are rated as higher quality in pairwise
comparison. These results can inform human judges to provide higher-quality
training signals and contribute to more aligned AI systems, while revealing
important aspects of human-AI interaction regarding persuasion dynamics in
language models.

Method: 引入两阶段数据合成管道，使用基线网络代理在多个角色中工作：尝试回答问题、验证事实性、检查替代答案和执行过滤，通过蒸馏方法进行受控训练评估。

Result: 实验表明，尽管数据集规模较小，但训练出的网络代理在多个网络基准测试中表现更有效，工具使用动作的多样性是现有数据集的两倍，同时避免了重复的工具调用行为。

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成更高质量的训练数据，有效提升网络代理在复杂问答任务中的性能，特别是在长时程推理和工具使用方面。

Abstract: Web-based 'deep research' agents aim to solve complex question - answering
tasks through long-horizon interactions with online tools. These tasks remain
challenging, as the underlying language models are often not optimized for
long-horizon reasoning and exploration. Prior work has proposed workflows for
constructing instruction-tuning datasets, often leveraging knowledge graphs.
However, such methods typically lack fine-grained control over difficulty and
quality, yielding synthetic data that falls short of capturing the complexity
required for long-horizon reasoning. Furthermore, many studies conflate data
and training effects by comparing models trained under different optimization
recipes, making it difficult to isolate and evaluate the effectiveness of the
data itself. We introduce a two-pronged data synthesis pipeline that generates
question - answer pairs by progressively increasing task complexity until a
frontier baseline web agent fails. The baseline agent plays multiple roles in
this process: attempting the questions, validating factuality, checking for
alternative answers, and enforcing filtering. To evaluate the effectiveness of
our synthesis methods, we adopt a controlled training setup based on
distillation from strong web agents. Experiments across multiple web-based
benchmarks show that our dataset - despite being smaller - enables the training
of more effective web agents than existing datasets. In particular, our data
exhibits twice the diversity in tool-use actions, allowing models trained on it
to achieve stronger performance while avoiding repetitive tool-calling
behaviors.

Motivation: 反驳当前研究中将语言模型训练与人类认知发展进行类比的做法，质疑"可读性"在小型语言模型能力涌现中的核心作用。

Method: 构建具有相同结构但可读性不同的合成数据集，比较模型在不同可读性文本上的训练表现。

Result: 模型在复杂成人级文本上的表现与简化语言相当，甚至在训练过程中更快发展出连贯性；统计简单性（n-gram多样性）是更好的学习能力预测指标。

Conclusion: 应避免将语言模型训练过度拟人化，需要更精确地理解支持小型模型能力涌现的实际属性，统计简单性比可读性更重要。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that very small language models (SLMs) can generate
surprisingly coherent text when trained on simplified, child-directed corpora
such as TinyStories. These findings have been interpreted as evidence that
readability -- characterized by accessible vocabulary, familiar narrative
structure, and simple syntax -- plays a key role in enabling such capabilities
to emerge. In this paper, we challenge that interpretation. We construct
synthetic datasets with matched structure but varied readability, and find that
readability alone does not predict coherence or learning efficiency in SLMs.
Models trained on complex, adult-level text perform comparably to those trained
on simplified language, and even exhibit faster development of coherence during
training. Instead, we show that statistical simplicity, as measured by n-gram
diversity, is a stronger predictor of learnability. Our findings caution
against the growing trend of anthropomorphizing language model training --
drawing parallels to human cognitive development without empirical basis -- and
argue for more precise reasoning about what properties actually support
capability emergence in small models.

Result: 成功开发了Element2Vec方法，能够有效表示化学元素，解决文本分布差异和数据稀疏性问题。

Conclusion: 这项工作为材料科学中AI驱动发现铺平了道路，提供了更准确和可解释的元素属性预测方法。

Abstract: Accurate property data for chemical elements is crucial for materials design
and manufacturing, but many of them are difficult to measure directly due to
equipment constraints. While traditional methods use the properties of other
elements or related properties for prediction via numerical analyses, they
often fail to model complex relationships. After all, not all characteristics
can be represented as scalars. Recent efforts have been made to explore
advanced AI tools such as language models for property estimation, but they
still suffer from hallucinations and a lack of interpretability. In this paper,
we investigate Element2Vecto effectively represent chemical elements from
natural languages to support research in the natural sciences. Given the text
parsed from Wikipedia pages, we use language models to generate both a single
general-purpose embedding (Global) and a set of attribute-highlighted vectors
(Local). Despite the complicated relationship across elements, the
computational challenges also exist because of 1) the discrepancy in text
distribution between common descriptions and specialized scientific texts, and
2) the extremely limited data, i.e., with only 118 known elements, data for
specific properties is often highly sparse and incomplete. Thus, we also design
a test-time training method based on self-attention to mitigate the prediction
error caused by Vanilla regression clearly. We hope this work could pave the
way for advancing AI-driven discovery in materials science.

Motivation: 现有PRM在TTS中的表现有时不如简单的多数投票，这引发了对如何有效利用PRM验证信号的关键问题。

Method: 开发理论框架来优化LLM和PRM信号的组合，提出加权聚合策略，并通过预计算方法校准权重函数。

Result: 在5个LLM和7个PRM上的广泛实验表明，校准方法显著提升了TTS效率，性能超越传统加权多数投票。

Conclusion: 投资更智能的聚合策略比单纯扩展测试时计算更能获得性能提升，为TTS提供了更有效的路径。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) are a cornerstone of test-time scaling (TTS),
designed to verify and select the best responses from large language models
(LLMs). However, this promise is challenged by recent benchmarks where simple
majority voting, which ignores PRM signals, occasionally outperforms standard
PRM-based selection. This raises a critical question: How can we effectively
utilize verification signals from PRMs for TTS? To address this, we start by
developing a theoretical framework for optimally combining signals from both
the LLM and the PRM. Our framework reveals that the optimal strategy is a
weighted aggregation of responses, a strategy whose effectiveness hinges on
estimating weights that capture the complex interplay between the models. Based
on our theoretical results, we empirically show that these optimal weighting
functions differ significantly across LLM-PRM pairs and, notably, often assign
substantial negative weights. Motivated by these insights, we propose efficient
pre-computation methods to calibrate these weighting functions. Extensive
experiments across 5 LLMs and 7 PRMs demonstrate that our calibration method
significantly boosts the TTS efficiency, surpassing the performance of vanilla
weighted majority voting while using only $21.3\%$ of the computation.
Ultimately, our work demonstrates that investing in a more intelligent
aggregation strategy can be a more convincing path to performance gains than
simply scaling test-time computation.

Conclusion: FACTS通过离线模板生成提供了一个快速、准确且隐私合规的表格摘要解决方案，解决了现有方法的多个关键限制。

Abstract: Query-focused table summarization requires generating natural language
summaries of tabular data conditioned on a user query, enabling users to access
insights beyond fact retrieval. Existing approaches face key limitations:
table-to-text models require costly fine-tuning and struggle with complex
reasoning, prompt-based LLM methods suffer from token-limit and efficiency
issues while exposing sensitive data, and prior agentic pipelines often rely on
decomposition, planning, or manual templates that lack robustness and
scalability. To mitigate these issues, we introduce an agentic workflow, FACTS,
a Fast, Accurate, and Privacy-Compliant Table Summarization approach via
Offline Template Generation. FACTS produces offline templates, consisting of
SQL queries and Jinja2 templates, which can be rendered into natural language
summaries and are reusable across multiple tables sharing the same schema. It
enables fast summarization through reusable offline templates, accurate outputs
with executable SQL queries, and privacy compliance by sending only table
schemas to LLMs. Evaluations on widely-used benchmarks show that FACTS
consistently outperforms baseline methods, establishing it as a practical
solution for real-world query-focused table summarization.

Conclusion: 该框架实现了IoT网络流量的全面高效解释，证明了混合检索方法的有效性。

Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) networks generate diverse and high-volume traffic
that reflects both normal activity and potential threats. Deriving meaningful
insight from such telemetry requires cross-layer interpretation of behaviors,
protocols, and context rather than isolated detection. This work presents an
LLM-powered AI agent framework that converts raw packet captures into
structured and semantically enriched representations for interactive analysis.
The framework integrates feature extraction, transformer-based anomaly
detection, packet and flow summarization, threat intelligence enrichment, and
retrieval-augmented question answering. An AI agent guided by a large language
model performs reasoning over the indexed traffic artifacts, assembling
evidence to produce accurate and human-readable interpretations. Experimental
evaluation on multiple IoT captures and six open models shows that hybrid
retrieval, which combines lexical and semantic search with reranking,
substantially improves BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, and BERTScore results compared with
dense-only retrieval. System profiling further indicates low CPU, GPU, and
memory overhead, demonstrating that the framework achieves holistic and
efficient interpretation of IoT network traffic.

Conclusion: BioMedSearch框架能够有效提高生物医学问答的准确性，特别是在复杂的推理任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Biomedical queries often rely on a deep understanding of specialized
knowledge such as gene regulatory mechanisms and pathological processes of
diseases. They require detailed analysis of complex physiological processes and
effective integration of information from multiple data sources to support
accurate retrieval and reasoning. Although large language models (LLMs) perform
well in general reasoning tasks, their generated biomedical content often lacks
scientific rigor due to the inability to access authoritative biomedical
databases and frequently fabricates protein functions, interactions, and
structural details that deviate from authentic information. Therefore, we
present BioMedSearch, a multi-source biomedical information retrieval framework
based on LLMs. The method integrates literature retrieval, protein database and
web search access to support accurate and efficient handling of complex
biomedical queries. Through sub-queries decomposition, keywords extraction,
task graph construction, and multi-source information filtering, BioMedSearch
generates high-quality question-answering results. To evaluate the accuracy of
question answering, we constructed a multi-level dataset, BioMedMCQs,
consisting of 3,000 questions. The dataset covers three levels of reasoning:
mechanistic identification, non-adjacent semantic integration, and temporal

### [55] [LLMs Can Get "Brain Rot"!](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13928)

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We propose and test the LLM Brain Rot Hypothesis: continual exposure to junk
web text induces lasting cognitive decline in large language models (LLMs). To
causally isolate data quality, we run controlled experiments on real Twitter/X
corpora, constructing junk and reversely controlled datasets via two orthogonal
operationalizations: M1 (engagement degree) and M2 (semantic quality), with
matched token scale and training operations across conditions. Contrary to the
control group, continual pre-training of 4 LLMs on the junk dataset causes
non-trivial declines (Hedges' $g>0.3$) on reasoning, long-context
understanding, safety, and inflating "dark traits" (e.g., psychopathy,
narcissism). The gradual mixtures of junk and control datasets also yield
dose-response cognition decay: for example, under M1, ARC-Challenge with Chain
Of Thoughts drops $74.9 \rightarrow 57.2$ and RULER-CWE $84.4 \rightarrow 52.3$
as junk ratio rises from $0\%$ to $100\%$.
  Error forensics reveal several key insights. First, we identify
thought-skipping as the primary lesion: models increasingly truncate or skip
reasoning chains, explaining most of the error growth. Second, partial but
incomplete healing is observed: scaling instruction tuning and clean data
pre-training improve the declined cognition yet cannot restore baseline
capability, suggesting persistent representational drift rather than format
mismatch. Finally, we discover that the popularity, a non-semantic metric, of a
tweet is a better indicator of the Brain Rot effect than the length in M1.
Together, the results provide significant, multi-perspective evidence that data
quality is a causal driver of LLM capability decay, reframing curation for
continual pretraining as a \textit{training-time safety} problem and motivating
routine "cognitive health checks" for deployed LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在生物医学领域应用时是否会将临床无关的社会人口学信息纳入药物不良事件预测，评估其公平性和可靠性。

Method: 使用FDA不良事件报告系统结构化数据，基于人物角色评估框架，测试ChatGPT-4o和Bio-Medical-Llama-3.8B模型在不同教育、婚姻、就业、保险等社会人口学特征下的预测表现。

Result: 发现系统性预测准确性差异，弱势群体被分配更高的不良事件预测概率；识别出显性偏见（预测推理中直接引用人物属性）和隐性偏见（预测不一致但未明确提及人物属性）两种偏见模式。

Conclusion: LLMs在药物警戒应用中存在严重风险，临床部署前迫切需要制定公平性评估协议和缓解策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in biomedical domains,
yet their reliability in drug-safety prediction remains underexplored. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs incorporate socio-demographic information
into adverse event (AE) predictions, despite such attributes being clinically
irrelevant. Using structured data from the United States Food and Drug
Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and a persona-based
evaluation framework, we assess two state-of-the-art models, ChatGPT-4o and
Bio-Medical-Llama-3.8B, across diverse personas defined by education, marital
status, employment, insurance, language, housing stability, and religion. We
further evaluate performance across three user roles (general practitioner,
specialist, patient) to reflect real-world deployment scenarios where
commercial systems often differentiate access by user type. Our results reveal
systematic disparities in AE prediction accuracy. Disadvantaged groups (e.g.,
low education, unstable housing) were frequently assigned higher predicted AE
likelihoods than more privileged groups (e.g., postgraduate-educated, privately
insured). Beyond outcome disparities, we identify two distinct modes of bias:
explicit bias, where incorrect predictions directly reference persona
attributes in reasoning traces, and implicit bias, where predictions are
inconsistent, yet personas are not explicitly mentioned. These findings expose
critical risks in applying LLMs to pharmacovigilance and highlight the urgent
need for fairness-aware evaluation protocols and mitigation strategies before
clinical deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过指令检索提升小语言模型推理能力的方法，在推理时检索结构化推理步骤而非生成，在多个专业领域任务上取得显著性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小语言模型在本地硬件上运行时难以处理多步推理和领域知识任务的局限性，同时保持隐私、低成本和环保优势

Method: 构建指令语料库，通过GPT-5为相似训练问题创建结构化推理指令，在推理时检索最相关指令并遵循其步骤

Result: 在MedQA、MMLU Professional Law和MathQA任务上，3B到14B参数模型无需额外微调即获得一致提升：MedQA提升9.4%，MMLU Law提升7.9%，MathQA提升5.1%

Conclusion: 指令检索为小语言模型提供了有效的推理增强方法，简洁指令效果更好，改进幅度取决于模型家族和内在推理能力

Abstract: Can we bring large-scale reasoning to local-scale compute? Small language
models (SLMs) are increasingly attractive because they run efficiently on local
hardware, offering strong privacy, low cost, and reduced environmental impact.
Yet they often struggle with tasks that require multi-step reasoning or
domain-specific knowledge. We address this limitation through instruction
intervention at inference time, where an SLM retrieves structured reasoning
procedures rather than generating them from scratch. Our method builds an
Instruction Corpus by grouping similar training questions and creating
instructions via GPT-5. During inference, the SLM retrieves the most relevant
instructions and follows their steps. Unlike retrieval-augmented generation,
which retrieves text passages, instruction retrieval gives the model structured
guidance for reasoning. We evaluate this framework on MedQA (medical board
exams), MMLU Professional Law, and MathQA using models from 3B to 14B
parameters without any additional fine-tuning. Instruction retrieval yields
consistent gains: 9.4% on MedQA, 7.9% on MMLU Law, and 5.1% on MathQA. Concise
instructions outperform longer ones, and the magnitude of improvement depends
strongly on model family and intrinsic reasoning ability.

Abstract: Deep Research (DR) agents, powered by advanced Large Language Models (LLMs),
have recently garnered increasing attention for their capability in conducting
complex research tasks. However, existing literature lacks a rigorous and
systematic evaluation of DR Agent's capabilities in critical research analysis.
To address this gap, we first propose HisRubric, a novel evaluation framework
with a hierarchical analytical structure and a fine-grained grading rubric for
rigorously assessing DR agents' capabilities in corporate financial analysis.
This framework mirrors the professional analyst's workflow, progressing from
data recognition to metric calculation, and finally to strategic summarization
and interpretation. Built on this framework, we construct a FinDeepResearch
benchmark that comprises 64 listed companies from 8 financial markets across 4
languages, encompassing a total of 15,808 grading items. We further conduct
extensive experiments on the FinDeepResearch using 16 representative methods,
including 6 DR agents, 5 LLMs equipped with both deep reasoning and search
capabilities, and 5 LLMs with deep reasoning capabilities only. The results
reveal the strengths and limitations of these approaches across diverse
capabilities, financial markets, and languages, offering valuable insights for
future research and development. The benchmark and evaluation code will be made
publicly available.

TL;DR: 研究发现，通过微调AI模型在特定作者的完整作品上，可以生成比专家人类写作更受读者偏好的文学文本，同时大幅降低创作成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI模型是否能够生成高质量文学文本并模仿作者风格，以及这对版权诉讼中关于AI生成衍生内容的影响。

Method: 进行预注册研究，比较MFA训练的专业作家与三种前沿AI模型（ChatGPT、Claude、Gemini）在模仿50位获奖作者风格方面的表现，通过159名专家和普通读者的盲评进行对比。

Result: 上下文提示生成的AI文本在专家评价中表现不佳，但经过作者特定微调后，专家和普通读者都更偏好AI生成的文本，且AI检测率极低（3% vs 97%）。

Conclusion: 作者特定微调使AI能够生成读者偏好的非逐字文本，为版权法中"对潜在市场影响"的公平使用因素提供了实证证据。

Abstract: The use of copyrighted books for training AI models has led to numerous
lawsuits from authors concerned about AI's ability to generate derivative
content.Yet it's unclear whether these models can generate high quality
literary text while emulating authors' styles. To answer this we conducted a
preregistered study comparing MFA-trained expert writers with three frontier AI
models: ChatGPT, Claude & Gemini in writing up to 450 word excerpts emulating
50 award-winning authors' diverse styles. In blind pairwise evaluations by 159
representative expert & lay readers, AI-generated text from in-context
prompting was strongly disfavored by experts for both stylistic fidelity
(OR=0.16, p<10^8) & writing quality (OR=0.13, p<10^7) but showed mixed results
with lay readers. However, fine-tuning ChatGPT on individual authors' complete
works completely reversed these findings: experts now favored AI-generated text
for stylistic fidelity (OR=8.16, p<10^13) & writing quality (OR=1.87, p=0.010),
with lay readers showing similar shifts. These effects generalize across
authors & styles. The fine-tuned outputs were rarely flagged as AI-generated
(3% rate v. 97% for in-context prompting) by best AI detectors. Mediation
analysis shows this reversal occurs because fine-tuning eliminates detectable
AI stylistic quirks (e.g., cliche density) that penalize in-context outputs.
While we do not account for additional costs of human effort required to
transform raw AI output into cohesive, publishable prose, the median
fine-tuning & inference cost of $81 per author represents a dramatic 99.7%
reduction compared to typical professional writer compensation. Author-specific
fine-tuning thus enables non-verbatim AI writing that readers prefer to expert
human writing, providing empirical evidence directly relevant to copyright's
fourth fair-use factor, the "effect upon the potential market or value" of the
source works.

TL;DR: MTI是一个无需训练的高效推理框架，通过仅在不确定位置应用选择性CFG干预和轻量级负提示引导，显著提升LLM的推理准确性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM推理方法通常通过增加推理计算来提升性能，但效率低下。研究发现推理不确定性高度局部化，只有少数高熵标记主导输出正确性。

Method: 提出MTI框架：1）选择性CFG干预，仅在不确定位置应用分类器自由引导；2）轻量级负提示引导，重用主模型的KV缓存来高效近似无条件解码。

Result: 在通用、编程和STEM任务上取得一致提升：Qwen3-8B-Base在8个基准上平均提升1.35%，Qwen3-32B-Reasoning在AIME2024上提升5%，同时保持高效率。

Conclusion: MTI证明了通过局部化干预策略可以有效提升LLM推理性能，为高效推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has focused on test-time
scaling to improve reasoning via increased inference computation, but often at
the cost of efficiency. We revisit test-time behavior and uncover a simple yet
underexplored phenomenon: reasoning uncertainty is highly localized-only a
small subset of high-entropy tokens dominantly affects output correctness.
Motivated by this, we propose Minimal Test-Time Intervention (MTI), a
training-free framework that enhances reasoning accuracy and stability with
minimal overhead. MTI includes: (i) Selective CFG intervention, applying
classifier-free guidance only at uncertain positions; and (ii) Lightweight
negative-prompt guidance, reusing the main model's KV cache to approximate
unconditional decoding efficiently. MTI yields consistent gains across general,
coding, and STEM tasks-e.g., +1.35% average improvement on eight benchmarks for
Qwen3-8B-Base and +5% on AIME2024 using Qwen3-32B-Reasoning-while remaining
highly efficient.

Motivation: 由于现实世界RAG系统的复杂性，存在许多导致错误输出的潜在原因。理解实践中可能发生的错误范围对于稳健部署至关重要。

Method: 提出了新的错误类型分类法，收集了错误RAG响应数据集并进行错误类型标注，开发了与分类法对齐的自动评估方法。

Result: 建立了全面的RAG错误分类体系，提供了带标注的数据集，实现了可用于开发过程中跟踪和解决错误的自动评估方法。

Conclusion: 该工作为RAG系统的错误分析和改进提供了系统化的框架和实用工具，有助于提升RAG系统的可靠性和部署质量。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a prevalent approach for building
LLM-based question-answering systems that can take advantage of external
knowledge databases. Due to the complexity of real-world RAG systems, there are
many potential causes for erroneous outputs. Understanding the range of errors
that can occur in practice is crucial for robust deployment. We present a new
taxonomy of the error types that can occur in realistic RAG systems, examples
of each, and practical advice for addressing them. Additionally, we curate a
dataset of erroneous RAG responses annotated by error types. We then propose an
auto-evaluation method aligned with our taxonomy that can be used in practice
to track and address errors during development. Code and data are available at

Motivation: 当前大语言模型开发依赖大规模训练语料，但大多数数据许可状态不明确，限制了真正开放模型的发展。对于非英语语言特别是德语，开放许可文本仍然严重稀缺。

Method: 从41个来源系统收集数据，涵盖7个领域；实施全面的质量过滤、去重和文本格式修复处理流程；所有子集采用至少CC-BY-SA 4.0或等效许可；发布语料构建和数据过滤代码。

Result: 构建了包含154.56亿token的高质量德语文本语料库，所有数据具有可验证的开放许可，确保模型训练和再分发的法律合规性。

Conclusion: 德国语料库解决了德语开放预训练数据的关键缺口，支持真正开放德语语言模型的开发，且具有完全可复现性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Large language model development relies on large-scale training corpora, yet
most contain data of unclear licensing status, limiting the development of
truly open models. This problem is exacerbated for non-English languages, where
openly licensed text remains critically scarce. We introduce the German
Commons, the largest collection of openly licensed German text to date. It
compiles data from 41 sources across seven domains, encompassing legal,
scientific, cultural, political, news, economic, and web text. Through
systematic sourcing from established data providers with verifiable licensing,
it yields 154.56 billion tokens of high-quality text for language model
training. Our processing pipeline implements comprehensive quality filtering,
deduplication, and text formatting fixes, ensuring consistent quality across
heterogeneous text sources. All domain subsets feature licenses of at least
CC-BY-SA 4.0 or equivalent, ensuring legal compliance for model training and
redistribution. The German Commons therefore addresses the critical gap in
openly licensed German pretraining data, and enables the development of truly
open German language models. We also release code for corpus construction and
data filtering tailored to German language text, rendering the German Commons
fully reproducible and extensible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 正确答案不一定反映文化理解，需要评估LLM在跨文化语境中的推理能力。

Method: 引入CRaFT框架，使用文化流畅度、偏差、一致性和语言适应性四个指标，对来自世界价值观调查的50个文化问题在阿拉伯语、孟加拉语和西班牙语中进行评估。

Result: 结果显示显著的跨语言推理差异：阿拉伯语降低流畅度，孟加拉语增强流畅度，西班牙语保持稳定。GPT跨语言适应更好但一致性较低，FANAR推理稳定但僵化。

Conclusion: LLM的文化意识不是固有的，而是通过语言框架显现。CRaFT为评估多语言环境中的跨文化推理提供了新视角，为构建文化适应性语言模型提供了可行见解。

Abstract: Correct answers do not necessarily reflect cultural understanding. We
introduce CRaFT, an explanation-based multilingual evaluation framework
designed to assess how large language models (LLMs) reason across cultural
contexts. Rather than scoring outputs solely based on accuracy, CRaFT evaluates
model explanations using four interpretable metrics: Cultural Fluency,
Deviation, Consistency, and Linguistic Adaptation. We apply the framework to 50
culturally grounded questions from the World Values Survey, translated into
Arabic, Bengali, and Spanish, and evaluate three models (GPT, DeepSeek, and
FANAR) across over 2,100 answer-explanation pairs. Results reveal significant
cross-lingual variation in reasoning: Arabic reduces fluency, Bengali enhances
it, and Spanish remains largely stable. While GPT adapts more effectively
across languages, it exhibits lower consistency; FANAR shows stable but rigid
reasoning. These findings suggest that cultural awareness in LLMs is not
intrinsic but emerges through linguistic framing. CRaFT offers a new lens for
evaluating cross-cultural reasoning in multilingual settings, providing
actionable insights for building culturally adaptive language models.

Motivation: 评估LLMs在抽象推理任务中的语言偏见，因为现有研究多关注依赖策略或知识的推理任务，而抽象推理对日常生活至关重要。

Method: 提出了GlobalGroup任务，基于纽约时报Connections游戏构建了包含英语、西班牙语、中文、印地语和阿拉伯语五个语言背景的基准，并提出了游戏难度测量方法。

Result: 实验发现英语模态在抽象推理任务中表现更好，开源模型与闭源模型之间存在性能差异。

Conclusion: LLMs在抽象推理任务中存在语言偏见，英语模态表现更优，且模型类型影响性能表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can exhibit biases in reasoning capabilities due
to linguistic modality, performing better on tasks in one language versus
another, even with similar content. Most previous works evaluate this through
reasoning tasks where reliance on strategies or knowledge can ensure success,
such as in commonsense or math tasks. However, abstract reasoning is vital to
reasoning for everyday life, where people apply "out-of-the-box thinking" to
identify and use patterns for solutions, without a reliance on formulaic
approaches. Comparatively, little work has evaluated linguistic biases in this
task type. In this paper, we propose a task inspired by the New York Times
Connections: GlobalGroup, that evaluates models in an abstract reasoning task
across several languages. We constructed a game benchmark with five linguistic
backgrounds -- English, Spanish, Chinese, Hindi, and Arabic -- in both the
native language and an English translation for comparison. We also proposed
game difficulty measurements to evaluate models on games with similar
difficulty, enabling a more controlled comparison, which is particularly
important in reasoning evaluations. Through experimentation, we find English
modalities largely lead to better performance in this abstract reasoning task,
and performance disparities between open- and closed-source models.

Abstract: Language is, as commonly theorized, largely arbitrary. Yet, systematic
relationships between phonetics and semantics have been observed in many
specific cases. To what degree could those systematic relationships manifest
themselves in large scale, quantitative investigations--both in previously
identified and unidentified phenomena? This work undertakes a distributional
approach to quantifying phonosemantic iconicity at scale across 6 diverse
languages (English, Spanish, Hindi, Finnish, Turkish, and Tamil). In each
language, we analyze the alignment of morphemes' phonetic and semantic
similarity spaces with a suite of statistical measures, and discover an array
of interpretable phonosemantic alignments not previously identified in the
literature, along with crosslinguistic patterns. We also analyze 5 previously
hypothesized phonosemantic alignments, finding support for some such alignments
and mixed results for others.

Result: 在增量指令任务中，性能平均提升56.6%，峰值能力提高24.7%，不可靠性降低35.3%

Conclusion: 将不确定性作为首要信号而非干扰因素，可同时提升对话AI的准确性和可靠性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer significant performance degradation in
multi-turn conversations when information is presented incrementally. Given
that multi-turn conversations characterize everyday interactions with LLMs,
this degradation poses a severe challenge to real world usability. We
hypothesize that abrupt increases in model uncertainty signal misalignment in
multi-turn LLM interactions, and we exploit this insight to dynamically realign
conversational context. We introduce ERGO (Entropy-guided Resetting for
Generation Optimization), which continuously quantifies internal uncertainty
via Shannon entropy over next token distributions and triggers adaptive prompt
consolidation when a sharp spike in entropy is detected. By treating
uncertainty as a first class signal rather than a nuisance to eliminate, ERGO
embraces variability in language and modeling, representing and responding to
uncertainty. In multi-turn tasks with incrementally revealed instructions, ERGO
yields a 56.6% average performance gain over standard baselines, increases
aptitude (peak performance capability) by 24.7%, and decreases unreliability
(variability in performance) by 35.3%, demonstrating that uncertainty aware
interventions can improve both accuracy and reliability in conversational AI.

TL;DR: DROID是一个紧凑的端到端框架，通过结合通用语义编码器和领域特定编码器的双重表示，使用单一校准阈值进行OOS意图检测，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检测超出范围(OOS)的用户话语是任务导向对话系统和开放集意图识别的关键挑战，现有方法依赖强分布假设或辅助校准模块。

Method: 结合通用句子编码器(USE)和领域适应的Transformer去噪自编码器(TSDAE)的双编码器框架，融合表示后通过轻量级分支分类器处理，使用单一校准阈值分离领域内和OOS意图，并加入合成和开放领域异常增强。

Result: 仅使用150万可训练参数，在多个意图基准测试中持续优于最新基线方法，已知意图的macro-F1提升6-15%，OOS意图提升8-20%，在低资源设置中收益最显著。

Conclusion: 双重编码器表示与简单校准可以产生鲁棒、可扩展且可靠的OOS检测，适用于神经对话系统。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-scope (OOS) user utterances remains a key challenge in
task-oriented dialogue systems and, more broadly, in open-set intent
recognition. Existing approaches often depend on strong distributional
assumptions or auxiliary calibration modules. We present DROID (Dual
Representation for Out-of-Scope Intent Detection), a compact end-to-end
framework that combines two complementary encoders -- the Universal Sentence
Encoder (USE) for broad semantic generalization and a domain-adapted
Transformer-based Denoising Autoencoder (TSDAE) for domain-specific contextual
distinctions. Their fused representations are processed by a lightweight
branched classifier with a single calibrated threshold that separates in-domain
and OOS intents without post-hoc scoring. To enhance boundary learning under
limited supervision, DROID incorporates both synthetic and open-domain outlier
augmentation. Despite using only 1.5M trainable parameters, DROID consistently
outperforms recent state-of-the-art baselines across multiple intent
benchmarks, achieving macro-F1 improvements of 6--15% for known and 8--20% for
OOS intents, with the most significant gains in low-resource settings. These
results demonstrate that dual-encoder representations with simple calibration
can yield robust, scalable, and reliable OOS detection for neural dialogue
systems.

Method: 开发了SecKnowledge 2.0数据增强和格式化管道，集成了专家在环的推理格式指导和LLM驱动的多步基础化，生成更高质量、任务基础的网络安全推理轨迹。

Result: 在多样化网络安全基准测试中，CyberPal 2.0持续优于基线模型，匹配或超越各种开源和闭源前沿模型。在核心网络威胁情报任务中排名第二，在威胁调查任务中20B模型排名第一，4B模型排名第二。

Conclusion: CyberPal 2.0证明了小型语言模型在网络安全领域的有效性，能够以更小的模型尺寸实现与大型前沿模型相当甚至更好的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming everyday applications, yet
deployment in cybersecurity lags due to a lack of high-quality, domain-specific
models and training datasets. To address this gap, we present CyberPal 2.0, a
family of cybersecurity-expert small language models (SLMs) ranging from 4B-20B
parameters. To train CyberPal 2.0, we generate an enriched chain-of-thought
cybersecurity instruction dataset built with our data enrichment and formatting
pipeline, SecKnowledge 2.0, which integrates expert-in-the-loop steering of
reasoning formats alongside LLM-driven multi-step grounding, yielding
higher-fidelity, task-grounded reasoning traces for security tasks. Across
diverse cybersecurity benchmarks, CyberPal 2.0 consistently outperforms its
baselines and matches or surpasses various open and closed-source frontier
models, while remaining a fraction of their size. On core cyber threat
intelligence knowledge tasks, our models outperform almost all tested frontier
models, ranking second only to Sec-Gemini v1. On core threat-investigation
tasks, such as correlating vulnerabilities and bug tickets with weaknesses, our
best 20B-parameter model outperforms GPT-4o, o1, o3-mini, and Sec-Gemini v1,
ranking first, while our smallest 4B-parameter model ranks second.

Motivation: 计算美食学需要多样化的高质量食谱数据集，但马其顿语食谱在数字研究中代表性不足，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 通过网页抓取和结构化解析构建数据集，处理异质配料描述，包括单位、数量和描述符规范化，使用点互信息和提升度分析配料共现模式。

Abstract: Computational gastronomy increasingly relies on diverse, high-quality recipe
datasets to capture regional culinary traditions. Although there are
large-scale collections for major languages, Macedonian recipes remain
under-represented in digital research. In this work, we present the first
systematic effort to construct a Macedonian recipe dataset through web scraping

Macedonian cuisine. The resulting dataset contributes a new resource for
studying food culture in underrepresented languages and offers insights into
the unique patterns of Macedonian culinary tradition.

*Zhichao Wang,Andy Wong,Ruslan Belkin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出RLSR方法替代SFT，在RL框架中利用SFT数据集，通过语义相似度奖励提升模型的指令遵循能力，在多个基准测试中表现优于SFT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受RFT启发，希望将广泛的SFT数据集融入RL框架，以改进基础模型的指令遵循能力，避免仅依赖下一词预测目标。

Method: RLSR方法：基础模型为每个提示生成多个响应，在语义嵌入空间中计算生成响应与人工标注响应的余弦相似度作为奖励分数。

Result: RLSR直接替代SFT时，在AlpacaEval上获得26.34%胜率，优于SFT的21.01%；SFT+RLSR组合达到30.73%胜率。

Conclusion: RLSR可有效替代或增强SFT，显著提升指令遵循能力，特别是在与SFT结合时效果最佳。

Abstract: After the pretraining stage of LLMs, techniques such as SFT, RLHF, RLVR, and
RFT are applied to enhance instruction-following ability, mitigate undesired
responses, improve reasoning capability and enable efficient domain adaptation
with minimal data. SFT relies on the next-token prediction objective to
strengthen instruction following in a base model using a large corpus of
human-labeled responses. In contrast, RFT employs a RL-based approach to adapt
fine-tuned reasoning models to specific domains with limited supervision.
Inspired by RFT, we propose replacing SFT with RLSR to leverage the extensive
SFT dataset in an RL framework, thereby improving the base model's
instruction-following ability. In RLSR, the base model generates multiple
responses for each prompt, and reward scores are computed as the cosine
similarity in the semantic embedding space between the generated and
human-labeled responses. RLSR can be utilized in multiple ways. It can directly
replace SFT, achieving superior performance on instruction-following
benchmarks-for example, RLSR (SB) on Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved an AlpacaEval
win rate of 26.34%, surpassing SFT's 21.01%. Furthermore, combining SFT and
RLSR further enhances downstream task performance; Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved
a win rate of 30.73% when trained with SFT + RLSR.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了动态角色精炼框架(DPRF)，通过迭代识别生成行为与人类真实行为之间的认知差异，并优化角色配置文件，以提高大语言模型角色扮演代理的行为对齐度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型角色扮演代理在模拟个体行为时，角色保真度常因手动创建的角色配置文件（如精选信息和个性特征）而受到损害，缺乏与目标个体对齐的验证。

Method: DPRF框架通过自由形式或基于理论的结构化分析，迭代识别生成行为与人类真实行为之间的认知差异，并精炼角色配置文件以减少这些差异。

Result: 在四个不同的行为预测场景（正式辩论、有心理健康问题的社交媒体帖子、公开访谈和电影评论）上使用五个LLM进行评估，DPRF相比基线角色配置文件显著提高了行为对齐度，并在模型和场景间具有良好泛化性。

Conclusion: 该工作为创建高保真角色配置文件和增强下游应用（如用户模拟、社会研究和个性化AI）的有效性提供了稳健的方法论。

Abstract: The emerging large language model role-playing agents (LLM RPAs) aim to
simulate individual human behaviors, but the persona fidelity is often
undermined by manually-created profiles (e.g., cherry-picked information and
personality characteristics) without validating the alignment with the target
individuals. To address this limitation, our work introduces the Dynamic
Persona Refinement Framework (DPRF).DPRF aims to optimize the alignment of LLM
RPAs' behaviors with those of target individuals by iteratively identifying the
cognitive divergence, either through free-form or theory-grounded, structured
analysis, between generated behaviors and human ground truth, and refining the
persona profile to mitigate these divergences.We evaluate DPRF with five LLMs
on four diverse behavior-prediction scenarios: formal debates, social media
posts with mental health issues, public interviews, and movie reviews.DPRF can
consistently improve behavioral alignment considerably over baseline personas
and generalizes across models and scenarios.Our work provides a robust
methodology for creating high-fidelity persona profiles and enhancing the
validity of downstream applications, such as user simulation, social studies,
and personalized AI.

TL;DR: LiteStage是一个针对多阶段推理的延迟感知层跳过框架，通过阶段式离线搜索分配最优层预算，结合在线置信度生成提前退出机制，在三个基准测试上实现1.70倍加速且准确率损失小于4.0%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多阶段推理虽然能提升小语言模型的推理能力，但增加了延迟。现有自适应加速技术（如层跳过）难以平衡效率与准确性，面临阶段间跳过敏感度差异和冗余输出令牌生成两大挑战。

Method: 提出LiteStage框架，结合阶段式离线搜索分配最优层预算，以及在线置信度生成提前退出机制来抑制不必要的解码。

Result: 在OBQA、CSQA和StrategyQA三个基准测试上，LiteStage实现了最高1.70倍的加速，准确率损失小于4.0%，优于先前的无训练层跳过方法。

Conclusion: LiteStage有效解决了多阶段推理中的延迟问题，在保持准确性的同时显著提升了推理效率，为小语言模型的实际部署提供了可行的加速方案。

Abstract: Multi-stage reasoning has emerged as an effective strategy for enhancing the
reasoning capability of small language models by decomposing complex problems
into sequential sub-stages. However, this comes at the cost of increased
latency. We observe that existing adaptive acceleration techniques, such as
layer skipping, struggle to balance efficiency and accuracy in this setting due
to two key challenges: (1) stage-wise variation in skip sensitivity, and (2)
the generation of redundant output tokens. To address these, we propose
LiteStage, a latency-aware layer skipping framework for multi-stage reasoning.
LiteStage combines a stage-wise offline search that allocates optimal layer
budgets with an online confidence-based generation early exit to suppress
unnecessary decoding. Experiments on three benchmarks, e.g., OBQA, CSQA, and
StrategyQA, show that LiteStage achieves up to 1.70x speedup with less than
4.0% accuracy loss, outperforming prior training-free layer skipping methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Flip-Flop Consistency (F²C)无监督训练方法，通过多数投票创建伪标签和表示对齐损失，提高LLM对不同提示变体的回答一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在面对同一问题的不同表述时经常产生不一致的回答，需要提高其对提示扰动的鲁棒性。

Method: F²C包含两个关键组件：共识交叉熵（CCE）使用多数投票创建硬伪标签；表示对齐损失将低置信度和非多数预测器拉向高置信度多数投票变体建立的共识。

Result: 在11个数据集上测试，F²C平均提高观察一致性11.62%，提升平均F1分数8.94%，减少格式间性能方差3.29%。在域外评估中也能有效泛化。

Conclusion: F²C是增强LLM在提示扰动下一致性、性能和泛化能力的有效无监督方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce inconsistent answers when faced
with different phrasings of the same prompt. In this paper, we propose
Flip-Flop Consistency ($F^2C$), an unsupervised training method that improves
robustness to such perturbations. $F^2C$ is composed of two key components. The
first, Consensus Cross-Entropy (CCE), uses a majority vote across prompt
variations to create a hard pseudo-label. The second is a representation
alignment loss that pulls lower-confidence and non-majority predictors toward
the consensus established by high-confidence, majority-voting variations. We
evaluate our method on 11 datasets spanning four NLP tasks, with 4-15 prompt
variations per dataset. On average, $F^2C$ raises observed agreement by 11.62%,
improves mean $F_1$ by 8.94%, and reduces performance variance across formats
by 3.29%. In out-of-domain evaluations, $F^2C$ generalizes effectively,
increasing $\overline{F_1}$ and agreement while decreasing variance across most
source-target pairs. Finally, when trained on only a subset of prompt
perturbations and evaluated on held-out formats, $F^2C$ consistently improves
both performance and agreement while reducing variance. These findings
highlight $F^2C$ as an effective unsupervised method for enhancing LLM
consistency, performance, and generalization under prompt perturbations. Code

TL;DR: 提出了MoM框架，将RAG从被动分块转为主动理解，通过模拟人类阅读认知过程来提取文档记忆，提升小语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG范式在理解相关文本块时存在深度知识内化和推理能力的限制，需要模拟人类认知过程来改进文档处理。

Method: 使用LLM模拟领域专家生成文档逻辑大纲，指导结构化分块和核心内容提取；采用多路径采样和多视角评估机制选择最优文档记忆；在SLM训练中融入反向推理策略；开发三层文档记忆检索机制。

Result: 在三个不同领域的实验结果表明，MoM框架解决了现有RAG系统的文本分块问题，为LLM提供语义完整的文档记忆，并为SLM实现以人为本的智能文本处理铺平道路。

Conclusion: MoM框架通过主动文档记忆提取和模拟人类认知过程，显著提升了RAG系统的知识内化和推理能力，为小语言模型实现智能文本处理提供了有效途径。

Abstract: The traditional RAG paradigm, which typically engages in the comprehension of
relevant text chunks in response to received queries, inherently restricts both
the depth of knowledge internalization and reasoning capabilities. To address
this limitation, our research transforms the text processing in RAG from
passive chunking to proactive understanding, defining this process as document
memory extraction with the objective of simulating human cognitive processes
during reading. Building upon this, we propose the Mixtures of scenario-aware
document Memories (MoM) framework, engineered to efficiently handle documents
from multiple domains and train small language models (SLMs) to acquire the
ability to proactively explore and construct document memories. The MoM
initially instructs large language models (LLMs) to simulate domain experts in
generating document logical outlines, thereby directing structured chunking and
core content extraction. It employs a multi-path sampling and multi-perspective
evaluation mechanism, specifically designing comprehensive metrics that
represent chunk clarity and extraction completeness to select the optimal
document memories. Additionally, to infuse deeper human-like reading abilities
during the training of SLMs, we incorporate a reverse reasoning strategy, which
deduces refined expert thinking paths from high-quality outcomes. Finally,
leveraging diverse forms of content generated by MoM, we develop a three-layer
document memory retrieval mechanism, which is grounded in our theoretical proof
from the perspective of probabilistic modeling. Extensive experimental results
across three distinct domains demonstrate that the MoM framework not only
resolves text chunking challenges in existing RAG systems, providing LLMs with
semantically complete document memories, but also paves the way for SLMs to
achieve human-centric intelligent text processing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种实验方法来研究训练数据与语言模型行为的关系，通过干预数据批次来测试数据与行为之间的假设关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解训练数据如何影响语言模型的行为，特别是事实知识获取方面，补充过去仅基于共现统计的观察性分析。

Method: 通过干预数据批次（"重写历史"）并重新训练模型检查点，包括从基准中选择评估项、匹配相关文档、修改文档、重新训练和测量效果等步骤。

Result: 结果表明现有识别相关训练文档的方法不能完全解释语言模型正确回答知识问题的能力，共现统计与模型行为之间存在关联但不够充分。

Conclusion: 提供了一个可复用的实验框架，供研究人员进一步测试训练数据如何影响模型行为的假设，代码已公开以促进未来研究。

Abstract: We present an experimental recipe for studying the relationship between
training data and language model (LM) behavior. We outline steps for
intervening on data batches -- i.e., ``rewriting history'' -- and then
retraining model checkpoints over that data to test hypotheses relating data to
behavior. Our recipe breaks down such an intervention into stages that include
selecting evaluation items from a benchmark that measures model behavior,
matching relevant documents to those items, and modifying those documents
before retraining and measuring the effects. We demonstrate the utility of our
recipe through case studies on factual knowledge acquisition in LMs, using both
cooccurrence statistics and information retrieval methods to identify documents
that might contribute to knowledge learning. Our results supplement past
observational analyses that link cooccurrence to model behavior, while
demonstrating that extant methods for identifying relevant training documents
do not fully explain an LM's ability to correctly answer knowledge questions.
Overall, we outline a recipe that researchers can follow to test further
hypotheses about how training data affects model behavior. Our code is made
publicly available to promote future work.

TL;DR: 提出了DEG-RAG框架，通过实体解析和三元组反思来去噪LLM生成的知识图谱，显著提升图基RAG系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图基RAG系统依赖LLM自动构建知识图谱，但生成的图谱存在噪声（冗余实体和不可靠关系），这会降低检索和生成性能并增加计算成本。

Method: DEG-RAG框架包含两个关键技术：(1) 实体解析消除冗余实体，(2) 三元组反思移除错误关系，从而生成更紧凑、更高质量的知识图谱。

Result: 实验表明该方法不仅大幅减小图谱规模，还在多种流行的图基RAG变体上持续提升问答性能。

Conclusion: 该研究首次全面探索了LLM生成知识图谱中的实体解析问题，证明简单的去噪方法能显著改善图基RAG系统的效果。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enable large language models
(LLMs) instant access to relevant information for the generative process,
demonstrating their superior performance in addressing common LLM challenges
such as hallucination, factual inaccuracy, and the knowledge cutoff.
Graph-based RAG further extends this paradigm by incorporating knowledge graphs
(KGs) to leverage rich, structured connections for more precise and inferential
responses. A critical challenge, however, is that most Graph-based RAG systems
rely on LLMs for automated KG construction, often yielding noisy KGs with
redundant entities and unreliable relationships. This noise degrades retrieval
and generation performance while also increasing computational cost. Crucially,
current research does not comprehensively address the denoising problem for
LLM-generated KGs. In this paper, we introduce DEnoised knowledge Graphs for
Retrieval Augmented Generation (DEG-RAG), a framework that addresses these
challenges through: (1) entity resolution, which eliminates redundant entities,
and (2) triple reflection, which removes erroneous relations. Together, these
techniques yield more compact, higher-quality KGs that significantly outperform
their unprocessed counterparts. Beyond the methods, we conduct a systematic
evaluation of entity resolution for LLM-generated KGs, examining different
blocking strategies, embedding choices, similarity metrics, and entity merging
techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive
exploration of entity resolution in LLM-generated KGs. Our experiments
demonstrate that this straightforward approach not only drastically reduces
graph size but also consistently improves question answering performance across
diverse popular Graph-based RAG variants.

TL;DR: 研究发现小型多语言模型在检索任务中表现不如大型模型，但通过优化训练数据规模、负采样策略和数据多样性，可以开发出仅300M参数的紧凑模型，其检索性能达到甚至超过7B模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小型多语言模型在检索任务中表现不佳的问题，探索能否通过特定优化使小模型在检索任务上达到大模型的性能。

Method: 分析训练数据规模、负采样策略和数据多样性对多语言嵌入模型的影响，特别关注硬负样本的使用和任务多样性的作用。

Result: 增加训练数据规模初期有效但收益递减，硬负样本对提升检索准确率至关重要，任务多样性比语言多样性对性能贡献更大，最终开发出300M参数的紧凑模型。

Conclusion: 通过优化训练策略，小型多语言模型可以在检索任务上达到与大型模型相当甚至更好的性能，证明了模型压缩的可行性。

Abstract: Training effective multilingual embedding models presents unique challenges
due to the diversity of languages and task objectives. Although small
multilingual models (<1 B parameters) perform well on multilingual tasks
generally, they consistently lag behind larger models (>1 B) in the most
prevalent use case: retrieval. This raises a critical question: Can smaller
models be retrofitted specifically for retrieval tasks to enhance their
performance? In this work, we investigate key factors that influence the
effectiveness of multilingual embeddings, focusing on training data scale,
negative sampling strategies, and data diversity. We find that while increasing
the scale of training data yields initial performance gains, these improvements
quickly plateau - indicating diminishing returns. Incorporating hard negatives
proves essential for consistently improving retrieval accuracy. Furthermore,
our analysis reveals that task diversity in the training data contributes more
significantly to performance than language diversity alone. As a result, we
develop a compact (approximately 300M) multilingual model that achieves
retrieval performance comparable to or even surpassing current strong 7B
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全护栏模型存在两个主要问题：只能输出二元安全标签，无法适应不同领域的安全容忍度；需要完整模型输出才能进行安全检查，与流式推理不兼容。

Method: 开发了两种专用变体：生成式Qwen3Guard将安全分类转为指令跟随任务，实现三元分类（安全、争议、不安全）；流式Qwen3Guard引入token级分类头，支持实时安全监控。

Result: 在英语、中文和多语言基准测试中，Qwen3Guard在提示和响应安全分类方面达到了最先进的性能，支持119种语言和方言。

Conclusion: Qwen3Guard为全球LLM部署提供了全面、可扩展和低延迟的安全调节，所有模型均以Apache 2.0许可证公开发布。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more capable and widely used, ensuring
the safety of their outputs is increasingly critical. Existing guardrail
models, though useful in static evaluation settings, face two major limitations
in real-world applications: (1) they typically output only binary "safe/unsafe"
labels, which can be interpreted inconsistently across diverse safety policies,
rendering them incapable of accommodating varying safety tolerances across
domains; and (2) they require complete model outputs before performing safety
checks, making them fundamentally incompatible with streaming LLM inference,
thereby preventing timely intervention during generation and increasing
exposure to harmful partial outputs. To address these challenges, we present
Qwen3Guard, a series of multilingual safety guardrail models with two
specialized variants: Generative Qwen3Guard, which casts safety classification
as an instruction-following task to enable fine-grained tri-class judgments
(safe, controversial, unsafe); and Stream Qwen3Guard, which introduces a
token-level classification head for real-time safety monitoring during
incremental text generation. Both variants are available in three sizes (0.6B,
4B, and 8B parameters) and support up to 119 languages and dialects, providing
comprehensive, scalable, and low-latency safety moderation for global LLM
deployments. Evaluated across English, Chinese, and multilingual benchmarks,
Qwen3Guard achieves state-of-the-art performance in both prompt and response
safety classification. All models are released under the Apache 2.0 license for
public use.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM的代理检索系统，通过三个专门代理在结构化循环中协同工作，提高多跳问答中的检索精度和召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多跳问答需要收集多个证据片段，传统检索方法在精度和召回率方面存在挑战，需要更智能的检索系统来支持复杂问题的回答。

Method: 使用三个专门代理：问题分析器分解多跳问题为子问题，选择器为每个子问题识别最相关上下文（关注精度），加法器引入缺失证据（关注召回率）。选择器和加法器通过迭代交互生成紧凑而全面的支持段落集。

Result: 在四个多跳问答基准测试（HotpotQA、2WikiMultiHopQA、MuSiQue、MultiHopRAG）上，该方法持续优于强基线，实现了更高的检索准确率，同时过滤掉干扰内容。

Conclusion: 该代理检索系统能够显著提高多跳问答中的检索性能，使下游QA模型在依赖较少无关信息的情况下超越全上下文答案准确率。

Abstract: Retrieval plays a central role in multi-hop question answering (QA), where
answering complex questions requires gathering multiple pieces of evidence. We
introduce an Agentic Retrieval System that leverages large language models
(LLMs) in a structured loop to retrieve relevant evidence with high precision
and recall. Our framework consists of three specialized agents: a Question
Analyzer that decomposes a multi-hop question into sub-questions, a Selector
that identifies the most relevant context for each sub-question (focusing on
precision), and an Adder that brings in any missing evidence (focusing on
recall). The iterative interaction between Selector and Adder yields a compact
yet comprehensive set of supporting passages. In particular, it achieves higher
retrieval accuracy while filtering out distracting content, enabling downstream
QA models to surpass full-context answer accuracy while relying on
significantly less irrelevant information. Experiments on four multi-hop QA
benchmarks -- HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, MuSiQue, and MultiHopRAG --
demonstrates that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模式链接是Text-to-SQL系统中关键但未被充分探索的组件，现有方法主要关注SQL生成而忽视相关模式元素的检索，导致幻觉和执行失败问题。

Method: 采用双向模式检索框架，结合表优先检索后选择列和列优先检索后选择表两种策略，并辅以问题分解、关键词提取和关键短语提取等技术。

Result: 在BIRD和Spider等挑战性基准测试中显著提高了模式召回率并减少误报，SQL生成性能优于全模式基线并接近oracle性能，将完整模式和完美模式之间的性能差距缩小了50%。

Conclusion: 模式链接是提升Text-to-SQL准确性和效率的有力杠杆，无需查询优化即可实现显著性能提升。

Abstract: Schema linking -- the process of aligning natural language questions with
database schema elements -- is a critical yet underexplored component of
Text-to-SQL systems. While recent methods have focused primarily on improving
SQL generation, they often neglect the retrieval of relevant schema elements,
which can lead to hallucinations and execution failures. In this work, we
propose a context-aware bidirectional schema retrieval framework that treats
schema linking as a standalone problem. Our approach combines two complementary
strategies: table-first retrieval followed by column selection, and
column-first retrieval followed by table selection. It is further augmented
with techniques such as question decomposition, keyword extraction, and
keyphrase extraction. Through comprehensive evaluations on challenging
benchmarks such as BIRD and Spider, we demonstrate that our method
significantly improves schema recall while reducing false positives. Moreover,
SQL generation using our retrieved schema consistently outperforms full-schema
baselines and closely approaches oracle performance, all without requiring
query refinement. Notably, our method narrows the performance gap between full
and perfect schema settings by 50\%. Our findings highlight schema linking as a
powerful lever for enhancing Text-to-SQL accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid increase in academic publications across various
fields has posed severe challenges for academic paper analysis: scientists
struggle to timely and comprehensively track the latest research findings and
methodologies. Key concept extraction has proven to be an effective analytical
paradigm, and its automation has been achieved with the widespread application
of language models in industrial and scientific domains. However, existing
paper databases are mostly limited to similarity matching and basic
classification of key concepts, failing to deeply explore the relational
networks between concepts. This paper is based on the OpenAlex opensource
knowledge graph. By analyzing nearly 8,000 open-source paper data from
Novosibirsk State University, we discovered a strong correlation between the
distribution patterns of paper key concept paths and both innovation points and
rare paths. We propose a prompt engineering-based key concept path analysis
method. This method leverages small language models to achieve precise key
concept extraction and innovation point identification, and constructs an agent
based on a knowledge graph constraint mechanism to enhance analysis accuracy.
Through fine-tuning of the Qwen and DeepSeek models, we achieved significant
improvements in accuracy, with the models publicly available on the Hugging
Face platform.

TL;DR: MathMist是一个多语言数学推理基准数据集，包含7种语言的21K+对齐问答对，评估了多种LLM在零样本、思维链和代码切换推理范式下的表现，发现LLM在低资源语言中的数学推理能力显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学推理基准主要关注英语或少数高资源语言，缺乏对多语言和跨语言数学推理能力的全面评估，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 构建了包含7种语言（涵盖高、中、低资源语言）的21K+对齐问答对数据集，系统评估了开源和专有LLM在零样本、思维链和代码切换推理范式下的表现。

Result: LLM在不同语言间的数学推理能力存在显著差异，特别是在低资源语言环境中表现明显下降，无法保持一致的推理性能。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在跨语言数学推理方面存在持续缺陷，特别是在低资源语言环境中，需要进一步改进多语言推理能力。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning remains one of the most challenging domains for large
language models (LLMs), requiring not only linguistic understanding but also
structured logical deduction and numerical precision. While recent LLMs
demonstrate strong general-purpose reasoning abilities, their mathematical
competence across diverse languages remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks
primarily focus on English or a narrow subset of high-resource languages,
leaving significant gaps in assessing multilingual and cross-lingual
mathematical reasoning. To address this, we introduce MathMist, a parallel
multilingual benchmark for mathematical problem solving and reasoning. MathMist
encompasses over 21K aligned question-answer pairs across seven languages,
representing a balanced coverage of high-, medium-, and low-resource linguistic
settings. The dataset captures linguistic variety, multiple types of problem
settings, and solution synthesizing capabilities. We systematically evaluate a
diverse suite of models, including open-source small and medium LLMs,
proprietary systems, and multilingual-reasoning-focused models, under
zero-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), and code-switched reasoning paradigms. Our
results reveal persistent deficiencies in LLMs' ability to perform consistent
and interpretable mathematical reasoning across languages, with pronounced
degradation in low-resource settings. All the codes and data are available at

### [84] [Evaluating & Reducing Deceptive Dialogue From Language Models with Multi-turn RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14318)
*Marwa Abdulhai,Ryan Cheng,Aryansh Shrivastava,Natasha Jaques,Yarin Gal,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了LLM在对话中的欺骗行为，提出了信念错位指标来衡量欺骗，并开发了多轮强化学习方法减少欺骗行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM产生欺骗性输出的能力（无论是有意还是无意）带来了严重的安全隐患，其不可预测的行为加上对幻觉、错误信息和用户操纵的防护不足，构成了现实世界的严重风险。

Method: 在四种不同对话场景中评估欺骗行为，使用五种现有欺骗检测指标和提出的信念错位指标。引入多轮强化学习方法来微调LLM以减少欺骗行为。

Result: 新提出的欺骗指标与人类判断更相关；LLM在约26%的对话轮次中自然表现出欺骗行为；当被提示欺骗时，欺骗性相对基线增加31%；RLHF训练的模型平均欺骗率为43%；多轮强化学习方法使欺骗行为减少77.6%。

Conclusion: 对话中的欺骗行为是在交互历史中发展的，其有效评估和缓解需要超越单语句分析。多轮强化学习方法能显著减少LLM的欺骗行为。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with millions of people worldwide in
applications such as customer support, education and healthcare. However, their
ability to produce deceptive outputs, whether intentionally or inadvertently,
poses significant safety concerns. The unpredictable nature of LLM behavior,
combined with insufficient safeguards against hallucination, misinformation,
and user manipulation, makes their misuse a serious, real-world risk. In this
paper, we investigate the extent to which LLMs engage in deception within
dialogue, and propose the belief misalignment metric to quantify deception. We
evaluate deception across four distinct dialogue scenarios, using five
established deception detection metrics and our proposed metric. Our findings
reveal this novel deception measure correlates more closely with human
judgments than any existing metrics we test. Additionally, our benchmarking of
eight state-of-the-art models indicates that LLMs naturally exhibit deceptive
behavior in approximately 26% of dialogue turns, even when prompted with
seemingly benign objectives. When prompted to deceive, LLMs are capable of
increasing deceptiveness by as much as 31% relative to baselines. Unexpectedly,
models trained with RLHF, the predominant approach for ensuring the safety of
widely-deployed LLMs, still exhibit deception at a rate of 43% on average.
Given that deception in dialogue is a behavior that develops over an
interaction history, its effective evaluation and mitigation necessitates
moving beyond single-utterance analyses. We introduce a multi-turn
reinforcement learning methodology to fine-tune LLMs to reduce deceptive
behaviors, leading to a 77.6% reduction compared to other instruction-tuned
models.

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于混合词嵌入和超参数优化的阿尔茨海默病早期检测方法，使用Doc2Vec和ELMo的词向量结合语言特征，通过逻辑回归实现91%的分类准确率和97%的AUC。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病的早期检测对患者有益，可及早治疗减轻症状并降低医疗负担。语言能力变化是AD的主要征兆之一，可用于早期诊断。

Method: 创建基于Doc2Vec和ELMo的混合词嵌入获取句子困惑度分数，添加语言特征分析语法和语义，将嵌入特征向量输入逻辑回归并微调超参数。

Result: 达到91%的分类准确率和97%的AUC，优于现有最佳NLP模型的88%准确率。模型稳定性良好（准确率标准差0.0403，AUC标准差0.0174）。

Conclusion: 该方法准确稳定，可作为AD的大规模筛查方法，也可作为医生检测AD的补充检查手段。

Abstract: Early detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is greatly beneficial to AD
patients, leading to early treatments that lessen symptoms and alleviating
financial burden of health care. As one of the leading signs of AD, language
capability changes can be used for early diagnosis of AD. In this paper, I
develop a robust classification method using hybrid word embedding and
fine-tuned hyperparameters to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in the early
detection of AD. Specifically, we create a hybrid word embedding based on word
vectors from Doc2Vec and ELMo to obtain perplexity scores of the sentences. The
scores identify whether a sentence is fluent or not and capture semantic
context of the sentences. I enrich the word embedding by adding linguistic
features to analyze syntax and semantics. Further, we input an embedded feature
vector into logistic regression and fine tune hyperparameters throughout the
pipeline. By tuning hyperparameters of the machine learning pipeline (e.g.,
model regularization parameter, learning rate and vector size of Doc2Vec, and
vector size of ELMo), I achieve 91% classification accuracy and an Area Under
the Curve (AUC) of 97% in distinguishing early AD from healthy subjects. Based
on my knowledge, my model with 91% accuracy and 97% AUC outperforms the best
existing NLP model for AD diagnosis with an accuracy of 88% [32]. I study the
model stability through repeated experiments and find that the model is stable
even though the training data is split randomly (standard deviation of accuracy
= 0.0403; standard deviation of AUC = 0.0174). This affirms our proposed method
is accurate and stable. This model can be used as a large-scale screening
method for AD, as well as a complementary examination for doctors to detect AD.

TL;DR: 提出了Beyond One World基准测试，用于评估LLM在角色扮演中准确表现特定版本角色的能力，包含30个英雄的90个版本，测试事实回忆和道德困境处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在角色扮演中能否忠实一致地表现版本特定角色（如不同宇宙中的超级英雄），因为现有研究在这方面探索不足。

Method: 创建包含30个标志性英雄和90个特定版本角色的基准测试，包含两个任务：经典事件（事实回忆）和道德困境（伦理场景），并提出了Think-Act Matching指标来量化理由与行动的一致性。

Result: 实验发现：思维链提示能提升弱模型的叙事连贯性但会降低强模型的准确性；跨版本泛化仍是主要障碍；模型通常擅长思考或行动但很少两者兼备。

Conclusion: Beyond One World揭示了多宇宙一致性和推理对齐方面的关键差距，为角色扮演LLM提供了具有挑战性的评估标准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as role-playing agents,
yet their capacity to faithfully and consistently portray version-specific
characters -- for example, superheroes across comic and cinematic universes --
remains underexplored. Superhero canons such as Marvel and DC provide a rich
testbed: decades of storytelling yield multiple incarnations of the same
character with distinct histories, values, and moral codes. To study this
problem, we introduce Beyond One World, a benchmark for character-grounded
roleplay spanning 30 iconic heroes and 90 canon-specific versions. The
benchmark comprises two tasks: (i) Canon Events, which probes factual recall of
pivotal life stages, and (ii) Moral Dilemmas, which confronts models with
ethically charged scenarios. We score responses for canonical accuracy and
reasoning fidelity under a framework that separates internal deliberation
("thinking") from outward decisions ("acting"). We further propose Think-Act
Matching, a metric that quantifies alignment between reasons and actions and
serves as a proxy for model trustworthiness. Experiments across reasoning- and
non-reasoning-oriented models yield three findings: (1) chain-of-thought
prompting improves narrative coherence in weaker models but can reduce
canonical accuracy in stronger ones; (2) cross-version generalization within a
character remains a major obstacle; and (3) models often excel at either
thinking or acting, but rarely both. Beyond One World exposes critical gaps in
multiversal consistency and reasoning alignment, offering a challenging
evaluation for role-playing LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于置信度的多模型框架，通过模型多样性来提升医学问答性能，无需微调，特别适合资源受限的医疗机构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高性能医学大模型通常需要大量计算资源进行微调，限制了资源受限医疗机构的可及性。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：置信度检测模块评估主模型确定性，自适应路由机制将低置信度查询导向具有互补知识的辅助模型进行协作推理。

Result: 在PubMedQA上达到95.0%，MedMCQA上达到78.0%的优异表现，显著优于单模型方法和统一推理策略。

Conclusion: 策略性模型合作为改进医学AI系统提供了实用且计算高效的途径，对资源受限环境中先进医学AI的民主化访问具有重要意义。

Abstract: High-performing medical Large Language Models (LLMs) typically require
extensive fine-tuning with substantial computational resources, limiting
accessibility for resource-constrained healthcare institutions. This study
introduces a confidence-driven multi-model framework that leverages model
diversity to enhance medical question answering without fine-tuning. Our
framework employs a two-stage architecture: a confidence detection module
assesses the primary model's certainty, and an adaptive routing mechanism
directs low-confidence queries to Helper models with complementary knowledge
for collaborative reasoning. We evaluate our approach using
Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct, Phi-4 14B, and Gemma 2 12B across three medical
benchmarks; MedQA, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA. Result demonstrate that our framework
achieves competitive performance, with particularly strong results in PubMedQA
(95.0\%) and MedMCQA (78.0\%). Ablation studies confirm that confidence-aware
routing combined with multi-model collaboration substantially outperforms
single-model approaches and uniform reasoning strategies. This work establishes
that strategic model collaboration offers a practical, computationally
efficient pathway to improve medical AI systems, with significant implications
for democratizing access to advanced medical AI in resource-limited settings.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在字符级扰动下的鲁棒性，以防止在在线考试系统等场景中的LLM滥用。

Method: 引入NAMESHORT方法，在文本中插入不可见Unicode控制字符，通过字符级扰动来混淆tokenization并降低信噪比。

Result: 尽管存在强混淆，许多LLM仍保持显著性能，研究者通过多维度评估探索了这种鲁棒性的程度和机制。

Conclusion: LLMs在低层级扰动下表现出鲁棒性，这揭示了LLM滥用的风险以及在多样化应用中部署LLM的可靠性问题。

Abstract: This work investigates the resilience of contemporary LLMs against frequent
and structured character-level perturbations, specifically through the
insertion of noisy characters after each input character. We introduce
\nameshort{}, a practical method that inserts invisible Unicode control
characters into text to discourage LLM misuse in scenarios such as online exam
systems. Surprisingly, despite strong obfuscation that fragments tokenization
and reduces the signal-to-noise ratio significantly, many LLMs still maintain
notable performance. Through comprehensive evaluation across model-, problem-,
and noise-related configurations, we examine the extent and mechanisms of this
robustness, exploring both the handling of character-level tokenization and
\textit{implicit} versus \textit{explicit} denoising mechanism hypotheses of
character-level noises. We hope our findings on the low-level robustness of
LLMs will shed light on the risks of their misuse and on the reliability of
deploying LLMs across diverse applications.

Abstract: To advance a Weather-Ready Nation, the National Weather Service (NWS) is
developing a systematic translation program to better serve the 68.8 million
people in the U.S. who do not speak English at home. This article outlines the
foundation of an automated translation tool for NWS products, powered by
artificial intelligence. The NWS has partnered with LILT, whose patented
training process enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt neural machine
translation (NMT) tools for weather terminology and messaging. Designed for
scalability across Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) and National Centers, the
system is currently being developed in Spanish, Simplified Chinese, Vietnamese,
and other widely spoken non-English languages. Rooted in best practices for
multilingual risk communication, the system provides accurate, timely, and
culturally relevant translations, significantly reducing manual translation
time and easing operational workloads across the NWS. To guide the distribution
of these products, GIS mapping was used to identify language needs across
different NWS regions, helping prioritize resources for the communities that
need them most. We also integrated ethical AI practices throughout the
program's design, ensuring that transparency, fairness, and human oversight
guide how automated translations are created, evaluated, and shared with the
public. This work has culminated into a website featuring experimental
multilingual NWS products, including translated warnings, 7-day forecasts, and
educational campaigns, bringing the country one step closer to a national
warning system that reaches all Americans.

TL;DR: 论文提出了pluri-hop问题的新概念，针对需要跨所有文档聚合信息的复杂问答场景，并开发了PluriHopWIND数据集和PluriHopRAG方法来解决传统RAG在重复性、干扰性文档集中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有问答系统主要处理单跳或多跳问题，但现实中的报告数据（如医疗记录、合规文件）需要跨所有文档的聚合分析，对遗漏文档高度敏感，现有方法难以应对这种pluri-hop问题。

Method: 提出了PluriHopRAG架构：将查询分解为文档级子问题，使用交叉编码器过滤器在昂贵的LLM推理前丢弃无关文档，采用"检查所有文档、廉价过滤"的策略。

Result: 在PluriHopWIND数据集上测试，传统RAG方法F1得分不超过40%，而PluriHopRAG相对提升了18-52%的F1得分，证明了穷尽检索和早期过滤的价值。

Conclusion: PluriHopWIND数据集暴露了当前问答系统在重复性、干扰性文档集上的局限性，PluriHopRAG的性能表明穷尽检索和早期过滤是替代top-k方法的有效策略。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) have enabled progress on question answering (QA) when relevant
evidence is in one (single-hop) or multiple (multi-hop) passages. Yet many
realistic questions about recurring report data - medical records, compliance
filings, maintenance logs - require aggregation across all documents, with no
clear stopping point for retrieval and high sensitivity to even one missed
passage. We term these pluri-hop questions and formalize them by three
criteria: recall sensitivity, exhaustiveness, and exactness. To study this
setting, we introduce PluriHopWIND, a diagnostic multilingual dataset of 48
pluri-hop questions built from 191 real-world wind industry reports in German
and English. We show that PluriHopWIND is 8-40% more repetitive than other
common datasets and thus has higher density of distractor documents, better
reflecting practical challenges of recurring report corpora. We test a
traditional RAG pipeline as well as graph-based and multimodal variants, and
find that none of the tested approaches exceed 40% in statement-wise F1 score.
Motivated by this, we propose PluriHopRAG, a RAG architecture that follows a
"check all documents individually, filter cheaply" approach: it (i) decomposes
queries into document-level subquestions and (ii) uses a cross-encoder filter
to discard irrelevant documents before costly LLM reasoning. We find that
PluriHopRAG achieves relative F1 score improvements of 18-52% depending on base
LLM. Despite its modest size, PluriHopWIND exposes the limitations of current
QA systems on repetitive, distractor-rich corpora. PluriHopRAG's performance
highlights the value of exhaustive retrieval and early filtering as a powerful
alternative to top-k methods.

Method: 构建基于Reddit的高质量标注数据集，采用C-SSRS四标签标注框架，结合用户发帖历史和评论树数据，进行统计分析和LLM实验。

Result: 实验结果表明，纳入评论树数据能显著提升用户自杀风险水平的区分和预测能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为增强高危个体检测准确性提供了新视角，为早期自杀干预策略奠定了重要基础。

Abstract: Suicide remains a critical global public health issue. While previous studies
have provided valuable insights into detecting suicidal expressions in
individual social media posts, limited attention has been paid to the analysis
of longitudinal, sequential comment trees for predicting a user's evolving
suicidal risk. Users, however, often reveal their intentions through historical
posts and interactive comments over time. This study addresses this gap by
investigating how the information in comment trees affects both the
discrimination and prediction of users' suicidal risk levels. We constructed a
high-quality annotated dataset, sourced from Reddit, which incorporates users'
posting history and comments, using a refined four-label annotation framework
based on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Statistical
analysis of the dataset, along with experimental results from Large Language
Models (LLMs) experiments, demonstrates that incorporating comment trees data
significantly enhances the discrimination and prediction of user suicidal risk
levels. This research offers a novel insight to enhancing the detection
accuracy of at-risk individuals, thereby providing a valuable foundation for
early suicide intervention strategies.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在通用下一个词预测方面表现出色，但难以生成反映个人真实沟通风格的回复，如以自己风格回复邮件或社交消息。由于隐私问题，真实的SNS或邮件历史难以收集。

Method: 构建包含100个对话会话的多语言基准数据集（英语、日语、中文），用户与基于MBTI维度的心理基础NPC进行五天互动，捕捉自然的日常沟通模式。评估基于提示和微调的个性化方法。

Result: 建立了首个YNTP基准，为面向用户的语言建模奠定了基础。数据集已公开可用。

Conclusion: 提出的YNTP任务和基准数据集为研究用户对齐的语言模型提供了重要基础，能够更好地建模个人沟通风格。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general next-token prediction but still
struggle to generate responses that reflect how individuals truly communicate,
such as replying to emails or social messages in their own style. However, real
SNS or email histories are difficult to collect due to privacy concerns. To
address this, we propose the task of "Your Next Token Prediction (YNTP)", which
models a user's precise word choices through controlled human-agent
conversations. We build a multilingual benchmark of 100 dialogue sessions
across English, Japanese, and Chinese, where users interact for five days with
psychologically grounded NPCs based on MBTI dimensions. This setup captures
natural, daily-life communication patterns and enables analysis of users'
internal models. We evaluate prompt-based and fine-tuning-based personalization
methods, establishing the first benchmark for YNTP and a foundation for

Motivation: 当前基于RAG的生物医学问答系统存在幻觉问题，主要由于检索后噪声和证据验证不足，影响了回答的可靠性。

Method: 1) 引用感知推理，要求所有生成内容必须基于检索的医学文档；2) 迭代检索验证过程，通过验证代理评估证据充分性；3) MedTrust对齐模块，结合验证的正例和幻觉感知负例进行优化。

Result: 在MedMCQA、MedQA和MMLU-Med基准测试中，该方法在多个模型架构上均优于竞争基线，LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct和Qwen3-8B分别获得2.7%和2.4%的平均准确率提升。

Conclusion: MedTrust-Guided Iterative RAG框架有效提升了生物医学问答的事实一致性和可靠性，显著减少了幻觉问题。

Abstract: Biomedical question answering (QA) requires accurate interpretation of
complex medical knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising
capabilities in this domain, with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems
enhancing performance by incorporating external medical literature. However,
RAG-based approaches in biomedical QA suffer from hallucinations due to
post-retrieval noise and insufficient verification of retrieved evidence,
undermining response reliability. We propose MedTrust-Guided Iterative RAG, a
framework designed to enhance factual consistency and mitigate hallucinations
in medical QA. Our method introduces three key innovations. First, it enforces
citation-aware reasoning by requiring all generated content to be explicitly
grounded in retrieved medical documents, with structured Negative Knowledge
Assertions used when evidence is insufficient. Second, it employs an iterative
retrieval-verification process, where a verification agent assesses evidence
adequacy and refines queries through Medical Gap Analysis until reliable
information is obtained. Third, it integrates the MedTrust-Align Module (MTAM)
that combines verified positive examples with hallucination-aware negative
samples, leveraging Direct Preference Optimization to reinforce
citation-grounded reasoning while penalizing hallucination-prone response
patterns. Experiments on MedMCQA, MedQA, and MMLU-Med demonstrate that our
approach consistently outperforms competitive baselines across multiple model
architectures, achieving the best average accuracy with gains of 2.7% for
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct and 2.4% for Qwen3-8B.

Abstract: Language models often struggle to follow multi-constraint instructions that
are crucial for real-world applications. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)
approaches suffer from dependency on external supervision and sparse reward
signals from multi-constraint tasks. We propose a label-free self-supervised RL
framework that eliminates dependency on external supervision by deriving reward
signals directly from instructions and generating pseudo-labels for reward
model training. Our approach introduces constraint decomposition strategies and
efficient constraint-wise binary classification to address sparse reward
challenges while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments show that
our approach generalizes well, achieving strong improvements across 3 in-domain
and 5 out-of-domain datasets, including challenging agentic and multi-turn
instruction following. The data and code are publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了Explore to Evolve范式来构建可验证的Web代理训练数据，开发了WebAggregatorQA数据集和WebAggregator模型，在信息聚合能力上超越了GPT-4.1和Claude-3.7-sonnet。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源深度研究代理主要关注信息检索能力，而忽视了信息聚合这一支持深度研究的关键需求。

Method: 采用Explore to Evolve范式：先通过在线探索收集真实网络信息，然后使用12种高级逻辑类型选择和组合操作来自我演化聚合程序，生成可验证的QA对。

Result: 构建了包含10K样本、覆盖50K网站和11个领域的WebAggregatorQA数据集。WebAggregator-8B模型性能匹配GPT-4.1，32B版本在GAIA-text上超越GPT-4.1超过10%，接近Claude-3.7-sonnet。在WebAggregatorQA测试集上，Claude-3.7-sonnet仅得28%，GPT-4.1得25.8%。

Conclusion: 即使代理能够检索所有参考资料，在信息聚合任务上仍表现不佳，凸显了加强Web代理基础模型信息聚合能力的必要性。

Abstract: Deep research web agents not only retrieve information from diverse sources
such as web environments, files, and multimodal inputs, but more importantly,
they need to rigorously analyze and aggregate knowledge for insightful
research. However, existing open-source deep research agents predominantly
focus on enhancing information-seeking capabilities of web agents to locate
specific information, while overlooking the essential need for information
aggregation, which would limit their ability to support in-depth research. We
propose an Explore to Evolve paradigm to scalably construct verifiable training
data for web agents. Begins with proactive online exploration, an agent sources
grounded information by exploring the real web. Using the collected evidence,
the agent then self-evolves an aggregation program by selecting, composing, and
refining operations from 12 high-level logical types to synthesize a verifiable
QA pair. This evolution from high-level guidance to concrete operations allowed
us to scalably produce WebAggregatorQA, a dataset of 10K samples across 50K
websites and 11 domains. Based on an open-source agent framework, SmolAgents,
we collect supervised fine-tuning trajectories to develop a series of
foundation models, WebAggregator. WebAggregator-8B matches the performance of
GPT-4.1, while the 32B variant surpasses GPT-4.1 by more than 10% on GAIA-text
and closely approaches Claude-3.7-sonnet. Moreover, given the limited
availability of benchmarks that evaluate web agents' information aggregation
abilities, we construct a human-annotated evaluation split of WebAggregatorQA
as a challenging test set. On this benchmark, Claude-3.7-sonnet only achieves
28%, and GPT-4.1 scores 25.8%. Even when agents manage to retrieve all
references, they still struggle on WebAggregatorQA, highlighting the need to
strengthen the information aggregation capabilities of web agent foundations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NLT框架用自然语言输出替代LLM中的编程式JSON工具调用，通过解耦工具选择和响应生成，显著提升工具调用性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决编程式JSON工具调用中的任务干扰和格式约束问题，这些因素会降低工具调用性能。

Method: 提出Natural Language Tools框架，将工具选择与响应生成分离，消除任务干扰和格式限制。

Result: 在10个模型和6400次试验中，工具调用准确率提高18.4个百分点，输出方差降低70%。开源模型获益最大，甚至超越闭源旗舰模型。

Conclusion: NLT显著改善工具调用性能，改进在提示扰动下保持稳定，并能扩展工具调用能力到不支持原生调用的模型，对强化学习和监督微调训练都有意义。

Abstract: We present Natural Language Tools (NLT), a framework that replaces
programmatic JSON tool calling in large language models (LLMs) with natural
language outputs. By decoupling tool selection from response generation, NLT
eliminates task interference and format constraints that degrade tool call
performance. When evaluated across 10 models and 6,400 trials spanning customer
service and mental health domains, NLT improves tool calling accuracy by 18.4
percentage points while reducing output variance by 70%. Open-weight models see
the largest gains, surpassing flagship closed-weight alternatives, with
implications for model training in both reinforcement learning and supervised
fine-tuning stages. These improvements persist under prompt perturbations and
extend tool-calling capabilities to models lacking native support.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LiRA框架通过锚定低资源语言到英语语义空间，结合多智能体协作编码和语言感知推理，在低资源条件下提升跨语言表示、检索和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在高资源语言上性能接近饱和，但在低资源语言上表现较差，主要由于训练数据有限、机器翻译噪声和跨语言对齐不稳定。

Method: LiRA包含两个模块：Arca通过锚定对齐和多智能体协作编码将低资源语言锚定到英语语义空间；LaSR在Arca基础上添加语言感知轻量推理头和一致性正则化。

Result: 在低资源基准测试（跨语言检索、语义相似性和推理）中，在少样本和噪声增强设置下均显示出一致的性能提升和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LiRA框架有效解决了低资源语言的跨语言表示问题，同时增强了检索和推理能力，为多语言NLP提供了稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) rapidly advance, performance on high-resource
languages (e.g., English, Chinese) is nearing saturation, yet remains
substantially lower for low-resource languages (e.g., Urdu, Thai) due to
limited training data, machine-translation noise, and unstable cross-lingual
alignment. We introduce LiRA (Linguistic Robust Anchoring for Large Language
Models), a training framework that robustly improves cross-lingual
representations under low-resource conditions while jointly strengthening
retrieval and reasoning. LiRA comprises two modules: (i) Arca (Anchored
Representation Composition Architecture), which anchors low-resource languages
to an English semantic space via anchor-based alignment and multi-agent
collaborative encoding, preserving geometric stability in a shared embedding
space; and (ii) LaSR (Language-coupled Semantic Reasoner), which adds a
language-aware lightweight reasoning head with consistency regularization on
top of Arca's multilingual representations, unifying the training objective to
enhance cross-lingual understanding, retrieval, and reasoning robustness. We
further construct and release a multilingual product retrieval dataset covering
five Southeast Asian and two South Asian languages. Experiments across
low-resource benchmarks (cross-lingual retrieval, semantic similarity, and
reasoning) show consistent gains and robustness under few-shot and
noise-amplified settings; ablations validate the contribution of both Arca and
LaSR. Code will be released on GitHub and the dataset on Hugging Face.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种压缩表示方法，通过提取和重组实体级标记来提高序列到序列共指消解模型在增量设置中的效率，在保持性能的同时实现1.8的压缩比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 序列到序列共指消解模型虽然性能优异，但在增量设置（如对话）中缺乏灵活性和效率，需要处理按顺序输入的文本。

Method: 通过提取和重组实体级标记，并丢弃大部分其他输入标记，创建压缩表示来提高效率。

Result: 在OntoNotes数据集上，最佳模型仅比完整前缀增量基线低0.6 CoNLL F1点，压缩比为1.8；在LitBank数据集上超过最先进性能。

Conclusion: 在序列到序列共指消解器中丢弃大量标记是增量共指消解的一个可行策略。

Abstract: Seq2seq coreference models have introduced a new paradigm for coreference
resolution by learning to generate text corresponding to coreference labels,
without requiring task-specific parameters. While these models achieve new
state-of-the-art performance, they do so at the cost of flexibility and
efficiency. In particular, they do not efficiently handle incremental settings
such as dialogue, where text must processed sequentially. We propose a
compressed representation in order to improve the efficiency of these methods
in incremental settings. Our method works by extracting and re-organizing
entity-level tokens, and discarding the majority of other input tokens. On
OntoNotes, our best model achieves just 0.6 CoNLL F1 points below a
full-prefix, incremental baseline while achieving a compression ratio of 1.8.
On LitBank, where singleton mentions are annotated, it passes state-of-the-art
performance. Our results indicate that discarding a wide portion of tokens in
seq2seq resolvers is a feasible strategy for incremental coreference
resolution.

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于评估主权LLMs社会文化元素和技术鲁棒性的分析框架和数据集，发现主权LLMs虽然支持低资源语言，但未完全满足目标用户需求，且可能低估安全等关键质量属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏验证主权LLMs社会文化背景对齐性以及安全性和技术鲁棒性的框架和数据集，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 构建新数据集并引入分析框架，用于提取和评估主权LLMs的社会文化元素，同时评估其技术鲁棒性。

Result: 实验结果表明，主权LLMs在支持低资源语言方面发挥重要作用，但未能完全满足服务目标用户的流行主张，且可能低估安全等关键质量属性。

Conclusion: 推进主权LLMs需要更广泛的评估，包含更全面、有根据且实用的标准。

Abstract: Recent trends in LLMs development clearly show growing interest in the use
and application of sovereign LLMs. The global debate over sovereign LLMs
highlights the need for governments to develop their LLMs, tailored to their
unique socio-cultural and historical contexts. However, there remains a
shortage of frameworks and datasets to verify two critical questions: (1) how
well these models align with users' socio-cultural backgrounds, and (2) whether
they maintain safety and technical robustness without exposing users to
potential harms and risks. To address this gap, we construct a new dataset and
introduce an analytic framework for extracting and evaluating the
socio-cultural elements of sovereign LLMs, alongside assessments of their
technical robustness. Our experimental results demonstrate that while sovereign
LLMs play a meaningful role in supporting low-resource languages, they do not
always meet the popular claim that these models serve their target users well.
We also show that pursuing this untested claim may lead to underestimating
critical quality attributes such as safety. Our study suggests that advancing
sovereign LLMs requires a more extensive evaluation that incorporates a broader
range of well-grounded and practical criteria.

TL;DR: 提出了WritingPreferenceBench数据集，发现当前RLHF方法主要学习检测客观错误而非主观质量偏好，生成式奖励模型通过显式推理链显著优于序列模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好学习方法在标准基准上表现良好，但当移除客观质量信号时性能显著下降，需要评估模型对主观质量偏好的理解能力。

Method: 构建包含1,800个人工标注偏好对的跨8种创意写作类型的数据集，比较序列奖励模型、零-shot语言模型评判和生成式奖励模型的性能。

Result: 序列奖励模型平均准确率仅52.7%，零-shot语言模型53.9%，而生成式奖励模型达81.8%。模型在不同写作类型间方差大，准确率从18.2%到81.8%。

Conclusion: 成功的偏好建模可能需要中间推理表示而非直接分类，当前RLHF方法主要学习检测客观错误而非捕捉主观质量偏好。

Abstract: Current preference learning methods achieve high accuracy on standard
benchmarks but exhibit significant performance degradation when objective
quality signals are removed. We introduce WritingPreferenceBench, a dataset of
1,800 human-annotated preference pairs (1,200 English, 600 Chinese) across 8
creative writing genres, where responses are matched for objective correctness,
factual accuracy, and length. On this benchmark, sequence-based reward
models--the standard architecture for RLHF--achieve only 52.7% mean accuracy,
while zero-shot language model judges perform at 53.9%. In contrast, generative
reward models that produce explicit reasoning chains achieve 81.8% accuracy. We
observe high within-model variance across genres: individual models range from
18.2% to 81.8% accuracy across different writing categories, with standard
deviations averaging 10.1%. This variance persists regardless of model scale,
with 27B parameter models showing no consistent improvement over 8B variants.
Our results suggest that current RLHF methods primarily learn to detect
objective errors rather than capture subjective quality preferences (e.g.,
creativity, stylistic flair, and emotional resonance), and that successful
preference modeling may require intermediate reasoning representations rather
than direct classification.

Motivation: 现有归纳推理研究面临两个挑战：一是现有归纳数据主要关注表面规律，缺乏复杂内部模式；二是现有方法仅简单提示LLMs或在简单提示-响应对上进行微调，未提供精确的思考过程也未实现难度控制。

Method: 提出CodeSeq数据集，将数字序列包装成算法问题来定义通项生成任务；通过反思失败测试用例和迭代修正生成监督微调数据；采用基于可解性和自生成案例成功率的强化学习奖励机制。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用CodeSeq训练的模型在各种推理任务上表现提升，并能保持模型的分布外性能。

Conclusion: CodeSeq通过合成数据生成和强化学习机制，有效提升了LLMs在归纳推理任务上的能力，同时保持了良好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make remarkable progress in reasoning tasks.
Among different reasoning modes, inductive reasoning, due to its better
alignment with human learning, attracts increasing interest. However, research
on inductive reasoning faces certain challenges. First, existing inductive data
mostly focuses on superficial regularities while lacking more complex internal
patterns. Second, current works merely prompt LLMs or finetune on simple
prompt-response pairs, but do not provide precise thinking processes nor
implement difficulty control. Unlike previous work, we address these challenges
by introducing \textit{CodeSeq}, a synthetic post-training dataset built from
number sequences. We package number sequences into algorithmic problems to
discover their general terms, defining a general term generation (GTG) task
correspondingly. Our pipeline generates supervised finetuning data by
reflecting on failed test cases and incorporating iterative corrections,
thereby teaching LLMs to learn autonomous case generation and self-checking.
Additionally, it leverages reinforcement learning with a novel Case-Synergy
Solvability Scaling Reward based on both solvability, estimated from the
problem pass rate, and the success rate of self-directed case generation,
enabling models to learn more effectively from both successes and failures.
Experimental results show that the models trained with \textit{CodeSeq} improve
on various reasoning tasks and can preserve the models' OOD performance.

TL;DR: 提出了RLAIF-SPA框架，使用强化学习从AI反馈来提升情感语音合成的表现力，通过ASR和LLM分别评估语义准确性和韵律-情感对齐，在Libri Speech数据集上显著优于Chat-TTS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTS方法在情感表达方面存在不足，要么依赖昂贵的情感标注，要么优化间接目标，导致生成的语音虽然准确但情感平淡。

Method: 采用RLAIF机制，结合ASR和LLM技术分别判断语义准确性和韵律-情感标签对齐，作为情感表现力和可懂度优化的直接奖励。通过韵律标签对齐在结构、情感、速度和音调四个维度提升表达质量。

Result: 在Libri Speech数据集上，相比Chat-TTS，WER降低26.1%，SIM-O提升9.1%，人工评估提升超过10%。

Conclusion: RLAIF-SPA框架有效解决了情感TTS中的表达力和自然度问题，通过直接优化语义准确性和韵律-情感对齐，显著提升了生成语音的质量。

Abstract: Text-To-Speech synthesis has achieved near-human quality in neutral speech,
but emotional expressiveness remains a challenge. Existing methods often rely
on costly emotion annotations or optimize indirect objectives that fail to
capture the emotional expressiveness and perceptual naturalness of speech,
leading to generated speech that is accurate but emotionally flat. To address
these challenges, we propose the RLAIF-SPA framework, incorporating a
Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) mechanism to employ Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) and Large Language Model (LLM) techniques to
respectively judge semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional label alignment as
a direct reward for emotional expressiveness and intelligibility optimization.
Specifically, it leverages Prosodic Label Alignment to enhance expressive
quality by jointly considering semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional
alignment along four fine-grained dimensions: Structure, Emotion, Speed, and
Tone. In addition, it incorporates Semantic Accuracy Feedback to ensure the
generation of clear and accurate speech. Experiments on the Libri Speech
dataset show that RLAIF-SPA outperforms Chat-TTS, with a 26.1% reduction in
WER, a 9.1% increase in SIM-O, and over 10% improvement in human evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖商业LLM（成本高、透明度低）和需要预先知道聚类数量的问题，适用于真实场景中的低资源环境。

Method: 首先让LLM为每个文本生成伪标签，然后在伪标签集上进行多标签分类，基于假设：同一聚类的文本会共享更多标签，在嵌入空间中更接近。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的评估显示，该方法达到并优于现有基线方法，同时保持简单和计算高效。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于低资源场景，在多个模型和数据集上表现稳定，伪标签比直接相似性匹配更具可读性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an intuitive, training-free and label-free method
for intent clustering that makes minimal assumptions using lightweight and
open-source LLMs. Many current approaches rely on commercial LLMs, which are
costly, and offer limited transparency. Additionally, their methods often
explicitly depend on knowing the number of clusters in advance, which is often
not the case in realistic settings. To address these challenges, instead of
asking the LLM to match similar text directly, we first ask it to generate
pseudo-labels for each text, and then perform multi-label classification in
this pseudo-label set for each text. This approach is based on the hypothesis
that texts belonging to the same cluster will share more labels, and will
therefore be closer when encoded into embeddings. These pseudo-labels are more
human-readable than direct similarity matches. Our evaluation on four benchmark
sets shows that our approach achieves results comparable to and better than
recent baselines, while remaining simple and computationally efficient. Our
findings indicate that our method can be applied in low-resource scenarios and
is stable across multiple models and datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为'nugget-as-rubric'的统一可验证范式，将原子信息点作为结构化评估标准，用于不同搜索增强工作负载的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的搜索增强LLM奖励建模面临局限性：基于规则的奖励（如精确匹配）对表达变化脆弱且无法应用于长形式工作负载；生成式奖励提高了鲁棒性，但在动态语料库中为长形式工作负载设计可验证且稳定的奖励仍然具有挑战性且计算成本高。

Method: 提出了'nugget-as-rubric'范式，将原子信息点作为结构化评估标准。为支持长形式设置，设计了基于查询重写的自动rubric构建管道，可以从静态语料库和动态在线网络内容中自动检索相关段落并提取rubrics。此外，引入了Search-Gen-V，一个4B参数的高效生成验证器，通过蒸馏思想和两阶段策略进行训练。

Result: 实验结果表明，Search-Gen-V在不同工作负载下实现了强大的验证准确性，使其成为搜索增强LLM的可扩展、鲁棒且高效的可验证奖励构建器。

Conclusion: 提出的'nugget-as-rubric'范式为搜索增强LLM提供了一种统一且可验证的评估方法，Search-Gen-V验证器在不同工作负载下表现出色，为搜索增强LLM提供了可扩展、鲁棒且高效的奖励构建解决方案。

Abstract: Search augmentation empowers Large Language Models with retrieval
capabilities to overcome the limitations imposed by static parameters.
Recently, Reinforcement Learning leverages tailored reward signals as a viable
technique to enhance LLMs performing tasks involving search. However, existing
reward modeling for search-augmented LLMs faces several limitations. Rule-based
rewards, such as Exact Match, are verifiable but fragile to variations in
expression and cannot be applied to long-form workloads. In contrast,
generative rewards improve robustness, but designing verifiable and stable
rewards for long-form workloads in dynamic corpora remains challenging and also
incurs high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a unified and
verifiable paradigm, "nugget-as-rubric", which treats atomic information points
as structured evaluation criteria for different search-augmentation workloads.
Short-form tasks correspond to a single rubric, whereas long-form tasks expand
to multiple rubrics aligned with the question's information needs. To support
long-form settings, we design an automatic rubric construction pipeline based
on query rewriting, which can automatically retrieve passages relevant to each
question and extract rubrics from them, both from static corpora and from
dynamic online web content. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{Search-Gen-V}, a
4B-parameter efficient generative verifier under our proposed verifiable
paradigm, which is trained via the idea of distillation and a two-stage
strategy. Experimental results show that Search-Gen-V achieves strong
verification accuracy across different workloads, making it a scalable, robust,
and efficient verifiable reward constructor for search-augmented LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Semantic prosody is a collocational meaning formed through the co-occurrence
of a linguistic unit and a consistent series of collocates, which should be
treated separately from semantic meaning. Since words that are literal
translations of each other may have different semantic prosody, more attention
should be paid to this linguistic property to generate accurate translations.
However, current machine translation models cannot handle this problem. To
bridge the gap, we propose an approach to teach machine translation models
about semantic prosody of a specific structure. We focus on Chinese BEI
passives and create a dataset of English-Chinese sentence pairs with the
purpose of demonstrating the negative semantic prosody of BEI passives. Then we
fine-tune OPUS-MT, NLLB-600M and mBART50 models with our dataset for the
English-Chinese translation task. Our results show that fine-tuned MT models
perform better on using BEI passives for translating unfavourable content and
avoid using it for neutral and favourable content. Also, in NLLB-600M, which is
a multilingual model, this knowledge of semantic prosody can be transferred
from English-Chinese translation to other language pairs, such as
Spanish-Chinese.

TL;DR: 本文比较了对比学习(CL)和监督微调(SFT)在基于大语言模型的检索重排序任务中的表现，发现SFT在权重更新方面明显优于CL，导致SFT整体表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在信息检索中，BERT模型使用对比学习更有效，而大语言模型使用监督微调更有效，这种差异引发了对哪种目标函数更适合LLM重排序的疑问。

Method: 将目标函数分解为权重和方向两个组件，在通用多模态检索(UMR)平台上进行对比实验，分析CL和SFT的相互作用。

Result: SFT提供了比CL更强的权重方案，而评分方向没有明显差异。大规模训练验证了SFT在MRB基准上达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: SFT在LLM重排序中比CL具有一致优势，这一发现对未来的研究和应用有重要价值。

Abstract: In information retrieval, training reranking models mainly focuses on two
types of objectives: metric learning (e.g. contrastive loss to increase the
predicted scores on relevant query-document pairs) and classification (binary
label prediction of relevance vs. irrelevance). For BERT-style encoders,
various studies have shown that contrastive learning (CL) can be more effective
than discriminative (classification) learning. However, for large language
models (LLMs), classification via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which predicts
''yes'' (resp. ''no'') token for relevant (resp. irrelevant) pairs, appears
more promising as it aligns well with the generative nature of LLMs. This
divergence raises a central question: which objective is intrinsically better
suited to LLM-based reranking, and what mechanism underlies the difference? In
this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis between CL and
SFT for reranking, taking the universal multimodal retrieval (UMR) as the
experimental playground. We first decompose the objectives into two components:
weight, which controls the magnitude of those updates, and direction, which
guides the model updates, then present a unified framework for understanding
their interactions. Through probing experiments, we find that SFT provides a
substantially stronger weighting scheme than CL, whereas the preferred scoring
direction shows no clear winner. Taken together, these results point to a
consistent advantage of SFT over CL for LLM reranking. To further validate our
findings, we conduct large-scale training with SFT and present new
state-of-the-art rerankers on the MRB benchmark. We also provide ablations on
SFT settings and expect our findings to benefit future research and
applications in this area.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI医疗工具快速发展但可能引入偏见、隐私侵犯和不平等访问风险，现有自动风险检测方法减少了人类对危害产生方式和受影响人群的理解参与。

Method: 开发人本框架，生成用户故事并支持多智能体讨论，帮助人们在部署前创造性思考潜在益处和危害。

Result: 用户研究中，阅读故事的参与者识别了更广泛的危害类型，响应均匀分布在13种危害类型上；未阅读故事的参与者主要关注隐私和健康（58.3%）。

Conclusion: 故事叙述帮助参与者推测更广泛的危害和益处，更创造性地思考AI对用户的影响。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming healthcare, enabling
fast development of tools like stress monitors, wellness trackers, and mental
health chatbots. However, rapid and low-barrier development can introduce risks
of bias, privacy violations, and unequal access, especially when systems ignore
real-world contexts and diverse user needs. Many recent methods use AI to
detect risks automatically, but this can reduce human engagement in
understanding how harms arise and who they affect. We present a human-centered
framework that generates user stories and supports multi-agent discussions to
help people think creatively about potential benefits and harms before
deployment. In a user study, participants who read stories recognized a broader

speculate about a broader range of harms and benefits and think more creatively
about AI's impact on users.

TL;DR: 该研究发现当前多模态生成模型在处理方言文本输入时存在显著性能下降（32.26%-48.17%），并提出了一种编码器缓解策略，能在保持标准英语性能的同时显著提升方言处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多模态生成模型是否能有效处理方言文本输入，因为方言使用者在与生成模型交互时经常使用方言，但现有模型主要针对标准英语训练。

Method: 构建了包含6种常见英语方言的大规模基准数据集（4200+提示），评估了17个图像和视频生成模型，并设计了一种基于编码器的缓解策略，教导模型识别新方言特征同时保持标准英语性能。

Result: 微调和提示重写等常见缓解方法只能小幅改善方言性能（<7%），且可能显著降低标准英语性能；而提出的编码器方法能将5种方言性能提升至与标准英语相当（+34.4%），同时对标准英语性能影响极小。

Conclusion: 当前多模态生成模型在处理方言输入时存在严重性能问题，提出的编码器缓解策略能有效解决这一问题，实现方言与标准英语性能的平衡提升。

Abstract: Contact languages like English exhibit rich regional variations in the form
of dialects, which are often used by dialect speakers interacting with
generative models. However, can multimodal generative models effectively
produce content given dialectal textual input? In this work, we study this
question by constructing a new large-scale benchmark spanning six common
English dialects. We work with dialect speakers to collect and verify over 4200
unique prompts and evaluate on 17 image and video generative models. Our
automatic and human evaluation results show that current state-of-the-art
multimodal generative models exhibit 32.26% to 48.17% performance degradation
when a single dialect word is used in the prompt. Common mitigation methods
such as fine-tuning and prompt rewriting can only improve dialect performance
by small margins (< 7%), while potentially incurring significant performance
degradation in Standard American English (SAE). To this end, we design a
general encoder-based mitigation strategy for multimodal generative models. Our
method teaches the model to recognize new dialect features while preserving SAE
performance. Experiments on models such as Stable Diffusion 1.5 show that our
method is able to simultaneously raise performance on five dialects to be on
par with SAE (+34.4%), while incurring near zero cost to SAE performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoRubric-R1V框架通过自动收集基于评分标准的生成奖励，将强化学习与过程级监督相结合，解决了多模态大语言模型在复杂推理中因仅奖励最终答案正确性而产生的虚假推理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型从感知任务发展到复杂多步推理，但基于可验证奖励的强化学习往往导致虚假推理，因为只奖励最终答案的正确性。

Method: 提出AutoRubric-R1V框架，通过可扩展的自聚合方法从成功轨迹中提炼一致推理检查点，无需人工标注或更强教师模型即可构建问题特定的评分标准，结合基于评分标准和结果的奖励。

Result: 在六个多模态推理基准测试中达到最先进性能，并在专门评估中显著提高推理忠实度。

Conclusion: AutoRubric-R1V通过整合过程级监督和强化学习，有效解决了多模态推理中的虚假推理问题，实现了更好的推理性能和忠实度。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have rapidly advanced from
perception tasks to complex multi-step reasoning, yet reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards (RLVR) often leads to spurious reasoning since only the
final-answer correctness is rewarded. To address this limitation, we propose
AutoRubric-R1V, a framework that integrates RLVR with process-level supervision
through automatically collected rubric-based generative rewards. Our key
innovation lies in a scalable self-aggregation method that distills consistent
reasoning checkpoints from successful trajectories, enabling problem-specific
rubric construction without human annotation or stronger teacher models. By
jointly leveraging rubric-based and outcome rewards, AutoRubric-R1V achieves
state-of-the-art performance on six multimodal reasoning benchmarks and
substantially improves reasoning faithfulness in dedicated evaluations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Pluto基准测试框架，用于评估LLM生成的Verilog代码在面积、延迟和功耗等综合指标上的效率，发现当前LLM在功能正确性上表现良好，但在效率方面仍落后于专家设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注功能正确性，但硬件设计需要优化综合指标如面积、延迟和功耗，现有基准缺乏优化的基准实现和验证测试台。

Method: 开发了Pluto基准测试框架，包含114个问题的评估集，配备自检测试台和多个帕累托最优参考实现。

Result: 实验显示最先进的LLM在功能正确性上达到78.3%的pass@1，但在综合效率方面落后：面积效率63.8%、延迟效率65.9%、功耗效率64.0%。

Conclusion: 需要像Pluto这样的效率感知评估框架来推动硬件导向的LLM研究进展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate hardware
design tasks, including the generation of Verilog code. While early benchmarks
focus primarily on functional correctness, efficient hardware design demands
additional optimization for synthesis metrics such as area, delay, and power.
Existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these aspects comprehensively:
they often lack optimized baselines or testbenches for verification. To address
these gaps, we present Pluto, a benchmark and evaluation framework designed to
assess the efficiency of LLM-generated Verilog designs. Pluto presents a
comprehensive evaluation set of 114 problems with self-checking testbenches and
multiple Pareto-optimal reference implementations. Experimental results show
that state-of-the-art LLMs can achieve high functional correctness, reaching
78.3\% at pass@1, but their synthesis efficiency still lags behind
expert-crafted implementations, with area efficiency of 63.8\%, delay
efficiency of 65.9\%, and power efficiency of 64.0\% at eff@1. This highlights
the need for efficiency-aware evaluation frameworks such as Pluto to drive
progress in hardware-focused LLM research.

TL;DR: COIG-Writer是一个中文创意写作数据集，通过逆向工程高质量文本提供写作过程和最终成果的三元组数据，揭示了创意写作需要叙事逻辑和语言表达两个组件的协同作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在创意写作方面存在系统性缺陷，特别是在非英语环境中训练数据稀缺且缺乏过程级监督的情况下。

Method: 通过系统逆向工程高质量文本构建COIG-Writer数据集，包含1,665个精心策划的三元组，涵盖51种文体，每个包含逆向工程提示、详细创意推理和最终文本。

Result: 发现三个关键洞察：过程监督需要通用数据稳定（最佳比例为1:12）；创意能力具有文化绑定特性（中英文性能差距89.26%）；词汇多样性与创意质量呈负相关（TTR悖论）。

Conclusion: 创意卓越源于逻辑框架和语言基础的相互作用，类似于数学推理增强但不能替代基础模型中的语言能力。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit systematic deficiencies in creative writing,
particularly in non-English contexts where training data is scarce and lacks
process-level supervision. We present COIG-Writer, a novel Chinese creative
writing dataset that captures both diverse outputs and their underlying thought
processes through systematic reverse-engineering of high-quality texts. Unlike
existing datasets that provide only input-output pairs, COIG-Writer comprises
1,665 meticulously curated triplets spanning 51 genres, each containing: (1) a
reverse-engineered prompt, (2) detailed creative reasoning documenting
decision-making processes, and (3) the final text. Through comprehensive
experiments, we identify a two-component model of creative writing: narrative
logic (provided by process supervision) and linguistic expression (maintained
by general-purpose data). Our findings reveal three critical insights: (1)
Process supervision is highly effective but requires stabilization with general
data. A ratio of at least one creative sample to twelve general samples is
needed to achieve optimal performance; below this threshold, the win rate
progressively degrades (from 62.75% down to 35.78%)., (2) creative capabilities
are culturally-bound with no cross-lingual transfer (89.26pp gap between
Chinese and English performance), and (3) lexical diversity inversely
correlates with creative quality (TTR paradox), suggesting high diversity
signals compensatory behavior for logical deficiencies. These findings
establish that creative excellence emerges from the interaction between logical
scaffolding and linguistic grounding, analogous to how mathematical reasoning
enhances but cannot replace linguistic competence in foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现推理模型的性能和最终答案分布对答案提取算法高度敏感，需要一种不依赖特定提取规则的方法来获得更可靠的评估结果。

Method: 使用额外的模型推理，将先前的输入和输出加上"Answer:"前缀作为提示，然后从重新生成的输出中选择或提取最终答案。

Result: 该方法在数学问题和开放式问答任务中表现出改进的性能和增强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Answer Regeneration框架可以为模型评估提供更可靠的结果，减少对特定答案提取算法的依赖。

Abstract: Evaluating generative models, such as large language models (LLMs), commonly
involves question-answering tasks where the final answer is selected based on
probability of answer choices. On the other hand, for models requiring
reasoning, the method of answer extraction plays a critical role. Our research
reveals that the performance of reasoning models and their final answer
distributions are highly sensitive to the answer extraction algorithm employed.
In order to mitigate this, we propose a basic framework: Answer Regeneration.
The method uses an additional model inference, providing the prior input and
output prefaced by the prompt "Answer:". The final answer is then selected or
extracted from the regenerated output. We show that this
extraction-rule-agnostic approach exhibits improved performance and enhanced
robustness. Furthermore, we have applied this framework to general math
problems and open-ended question answering tasks. Our analysis and this
framework could offer a more reliable results for model evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需外部数据的在线测试时框架，通过自监督优化MoE模型的路由决策，在文本生成过程中持续改进专家选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型在部署时由于分布偏移导致路由决策不理想，现有测试时适应方法主要针对密集模型且需要外部数据，不适用于MoE架构。

Method: 采用两阶段循环：预填充阶段和定期间隔时，基于已生成序列通过自监督优化路由决策；正常生成文本时保持修改后的路由器。通过轻量级加性向量仅更新选定层的路由器logits。

Result: 在具有挑战性的推理任务上获得一致性能提升，同时保持对上下文偏移的鲁棒性。例如在HumanEval上提升5.5%，与自一致性结合时在DeepSeek-V2-Lite上平均提升6%。

Conclusion: 该方法具有即插即用特性，能自然补充现有测试时缩放技术，为MoE模型提供高效的路由优化方案。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models achieve efficient scaling through sparse
expert activation, but often suffer from suboptimal routing decisions due to
distribution shifts in deployment. While existing test-time adaptation methods
could potentially address these issues, they primarily focus on dense models
and require access to external data, limiting their practical applicability to
MoE architectures. However, we find that, instead of relying on reference data,
we can optimize MoE expert selection on-the-fly based only on input context. As
such, we propose \textit{a data-free, online test-time framework} that
continuously adapts MoE routing decisions during text generation without
external supervision or data. Our method cycles between two phases: During the
prefill stage, and later in regular intervals, we optimize the routing
decisions of the model using self-supervision based on the already generated
sequence. Then, we generate text as normal, maintaining the modified router
until the next adaption. We implement this through lightweight additive vectors
that only update router logits in selected layers, maintaining computational
efficiency while preventing over-adaptation. The experimental results show
consistent performance gains on challenging reasoning tasks while maintaining
robustness to context shifts. For example, our method achieves a 5.5\%
improvement on HumanEval with OLMoE. Furthermore, owing to its plug-and-play
property, our method naturally complements existing test-time scaling
techniques, e.g., achieving 6\% average gains when incorporated with
self-consistency on DeepSeek-V2-Lite.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了语言模型预训练中的"中期训练"阶段，发现其在数学和代码领域效果最佳，能有效减少预训练与后训练数据之间的语法差距，相比持续预训练在领域内验证损失和预训练数据遗忘方面表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管中期训练在实践中很流行，但对其有效性的科学理解很少。本研究旨在系统探究中期训练阶段的作用机制和效果。

Method: 通过从头预训练语言模型并在不同领域的有监督微调数据集上进行控制实验，研究了中期训练的时间安排和混合权重等参数。

Result: 中期训练在数学和代码领域效果最显著，能更好地减少预训练与后训练数据之间的语法差距。时间安排比混合权重影响更大，早期引入专业数据能带来更好的领域内性能和通用语言建模能力保持。

Conclusion: 中期训练是一种领域适应技术，相比持续预训练能通过减少遗忘获得更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Recently, many language models have been pretrained with a "midtraining"
phase, in which higher quality, often instruction-formatted data, is mixed in
at the end of pretraining. Despite the popularity of this practice, there is
little scientific understanding of this phase of model training or why it is
effective. In this work, we conduct the first systematic investigation of
midtraining through controlled experiments with language models pretrained from
scratch and fine-tuned on supervised finetuning datasets in different domains.
We find that when compared after supervised fine-tuning, the effectiveness of
midtraining is highest in the math and code domains, where midtraining can best
reduce the syntactic gap between pretraining and posttraining data. In these
cases, midtraining consistently outperforms continued pretraining in both
in-domain validation loss as well as pretraining data forgetting after
posttraining. We conduct ablations on the starting time of the midtraining
phase and mixture weights of the midtraining data, using code midtraining as a
case study, and find that timing has a greater impact than mixture weights,
with earlier introduction of specialized data, yielding greater benefits
in-domain as well as preserving general language modeling better. These
findings establish midtraining as a domain adaptation technique that compared
to continued pretraining yields better performance through reduced forgetting.

TL;DR: MLIR-AIR是一个基于MLIR的新型编译器堆栈，专门为AMD NPU等细粒度空间架构设计，通过AIR方言提供异步和分层操作的结构化表示，实现了高效的空间调度和计算通信重叠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用编译器无法充分利用现代空间架构的并行性、局部性和同步控制，需要新的编译器基础设施来显式协调计算和数据，以充分利用这些架构的性能潜力。

Method: 基于MLIR构建MLIR-AIR编译器堆栈，定义AIR方言提供异步和分层操作的结构化表示，支持空间调度、计算分布和通信计算重叠，无需依赖临时运行时协调或手动调度。

Result: 在矩阵乘法中达到78.7%的计算效率，性能接近手工优化的MLIR-AIE实现；在多头注意力中，仅用约150行代码实现融合实现，有效表达复杂工作负载并映射到空间硬件。

Conclusion: MLIR-AIR能够将高级结构化控制流转换为高效利用NPU计算结构和内存层次的空间程序，通过编译器管理的调度实现异步执行、分块和通信重叠。

Abstract: General-purpose compilers abstract away parallelism, locality, and
synchronization, limiting their effectiveness on modern spatial architectures.
As modern computing architectures increasingly rely on fine-grained control
over data movement, execution order, and compute placement for performance,
compiler infrastructure must provide explicit mechanisms for orchestrating
compute and data to fully exploit such architectures. We introduce MLIR-AIR, a
novel, open-source compiler stack built on MLIR that bridges the semantic gap
between high-level workloads and fine-grained spatial architectures such as
AMD's NPUs. MLIR-AIR defines the AIR dialect, which provides structured
representations for asynchronous and hierarchical operations across compute and
memory resources. AIR primitives allow the compiler to orchestrate spatial
scheduling, distribute computation across hardware regions, and overlap
communication with computation without relying on ad hoc runtime coordination
or manual scheduling. We demonstrate MLIR-AIR's capabilities through two case
studies: matrix multiplication and the multi-head attention block from the
LLaMA 2 model. For matrix multiplication, MLIR-AIR achieves up to 78.7% compute
efficiency and generates implementations with performance almost identical to
state-of-the-art, hand-optimized matrix multiplication written using the
lower-level, close-to-metal MLIR-AIE framework. For multi-head attention, we
demonstrate that the AIR interface supports fused implementations using
approximately 150 lines of code, enabling tractable expression of complex
workloads with efficient mapping to spatial hardware. MLIR-AIR transforms
high-level structured control flow into spatial programs that efficiently
utilize the compute fabric and memory hierarchy of an NPU, leveraging
asynchronous execution, tiling, and communication overlap through
compiler-managed scheduling.

Motivation: LLM在语义等价输入下常产生不一致输出，现有训练数据稀缺且微调技术难以有效提升输出一致性。

Method: 采用系统化合成数据生成、三元组损失优化嵌入表示，以及基于中间层激活的层间模型融合方法。

Result: 融合模型显著提升了输出一致性，响应相似度比基线提高了约47.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法为工业RAG系统提供了实用的可靠性提升解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems leverage Large Language Models
(LLMs) to generate accurate and reliable responses that are grounded in
retrieved context. However, LLMs often generate inconsistent outputs for
semantically equivalent inputs, a problem compounded by the scarcity of
consistency-focused training data and the limitations of current fine-tuning
techniques in enhancing output consistency. We propose a new approach combining
systematic synthetic data generation, triplet loss for better embeddings, and a
novel layer-wise model merging approach. Using consistency-aware weights
derived from intermediate layer activations, our method effectively integrates
knowledge from specialized models. Experimental results how that our merged
model significantly enhances output consistency, achieving a ~47.5\%
improvement in response similarity over the baseline, thus offering a practical
solution for increasing the reliability of an industrial RAG system.

Motivation: 传统的扩展定律无法捕捉下游任务性能，特别是在上下文起关键作用的情况下，需要新的框架来理解训练计算量和上下文利用之间的相互作用。

Method: 提出了一个简单可解释的框架，通过在Llama-2-7B和Llama-2-13B的扩展上下文变体上进行实证验证，覆盖65,500个实例的三个任务：算术推理、常识推理和机器翻译。

Result: 框架能准确建模分布内下游性能，在三个数量级的训练计算量上具有良好泛化能力，并能可靠地外推随着上下文增加的性能表现。

Conclusion: 研究结果为训练计算量和上下文利用之间的相互作用提供了有价值的见解，为设计更高效的长上下文LLM提供了指导。

Abstract: Scaling laws have transformed our understanding of large language models by
linking upstream metrics like cross-entropy loss to design factors such as
model size, training data, and compute. However, these conventional laws fail
to capture downstream task performance, where context plays a critical role. In
this work, we propose a straightforward, interpretable framework that jointly
models downstream performance as a function of the training compute and the
provided context. We empirically validate our framework by fitting it on the
observed downstream performance of extended-context variants of Llama-2-7B and
Llama-2-13B across 65,500 unique instances spanning three tasks: arithmetic
reasoning, common sense reasoning, and machine translation. Our results
demonstrate that our framework accurately models in-distribution downstream
performance, generalizes across three orders of magnitude in training compute,
and reliably extrapolates performance as the amount of context increases. These
findings offer valuable insights into the interplay between training compute
and context utilization, providing guidance for designing more efficient
long-context LLMs for diverse downstream tasks. Our code is available at

Motivation: 心理健康障碍是全球残疾的主要原因，但由于主观评估、临床资源有限以及污名化，抑郁症、焦虑症和PTSD经常被漏诊或误诊，初级保健中误诊率超过60%，急需可扩展、易获取的诊断工具。

Method: 使用GPT-4.1 Mini、MetaLLaMA进行零样本提示，以及使用低秩适应(LoRA)微调的RoBERTa模型，在553个半结构化访谈数据集上进行基准测试。

Result: 模型在所有诊断类别中达到80%以上准确率，PTSD检测表现最佳（89%准确率，98%召回率），使用较短、聚焦的上下文片段能提高召回率，LoRA微调在低秩配置下仍保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的模型相比传统自报告筛查工具能显著改进诊断效果，为低门槛AI驱动的早期诊断提供了路径，为在资源匮乏或高污名化环境中整合机器学习到临床工作流程奠定了基础。

Abstract: Mental health disorders remain among the leading cause of disability
worldwide, yet conditions such as depression, anxiety, and Post-Traumatic
Stress Disorder (PTSD) are frequently underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed due to
subjective assessments, limited clinical resources, and stigma and low
awareness. In primary care settings, studies show that providers misidentify
depression or anxiety in over 60% of cases, highlighting the urgent need for
scalable, accessible, and context-aware diagnostic tools that can support early
detection and intervention. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of
machine learning models for mental health screening using a unique dataset of
553 real-world, semistructured interviews, each paried with ground-truth
diagnoses for major depressive episodes (MDE), anxiety disorders, and PTSD. We
benchmark multiple model classes, including zero-shot prompting with GPT-4.1
Mini and MetaLLaMA, as well as fine-tuned RoBERTa models using LowRank
Adaptation (LoRA). Our models achieve over 80% accuracy across diagnostic
categories, with especially strongperformance on PTSD (up to 89% accuracy and
98% recall). We also find that using shorter context, focused context segments
improves recall, suggesting that focused narrative cues enhance detection
sensitivity. LoRA fine-tuning proves both efficient and effective, with
lower-rank configurations (e.g., rank 8 and 16) maintaining competitive
performance across evaluation metrics. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based
models can offer substantial improvements over traditional self-report
screening tools, providing a path toward low-barrier, AI-powerd early
diagnosis. This work lays the groundwork for integrating machine learning into
real-world clinical workflows, particularly in low-resource or high-stigma
environments where access to timely mental health care is most limited.

Conclusion: LaSeR算法通过最后一词自奖励机制，以最小额外成本实现了推理和自我验证能力的联合优化

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a core paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). To address the lack of verification signals at test time, prior
studies incorporate the training of model's self-verification capability into
the standard RLVR process, thereby unifying reasoning and verification
capabilities within a single LLM. However, previous practice requires the LLM
to sequentially generate solutions and self-verifications using two separate
prompt templates, which significantly reduces efficiency. In this work, we
theoretically reveal that the closed-form solution to the RL objective of
self-verification can be reduced to a remarkably simple form: the true
reasoning reward of a solution is equal to its last-token self-rewarding score,
which is computed as the difference between the policy model's next-token
log-probability assigned to any pre-specified token at the solution's last
token and a pre-calculated constant, scaled by the KL coefficient. Based on
this insight, we propose LaSeR (Reinforcement Learning with Last-Token
Self-Rewarding), an algorithm that simply augments the original RLVR loss with
a MSE loss that aligns the last-token self-rewarding scores with verifier-based
reasoning rewards, jointly optimizing the reasoning and self-rewarding
capabilities of LLMs. The optimized self-rewarding scores can be utilized in
both training and testing to enhance model performance. Notably, our algorithm
derives these scores from the predicted next-token probability distribution of
the last token immediately after generation, incurring only the minimal extra
cost of one additional token inference. Experiments show that our method not
only improves the model's reasoning performance but also equips it with
remarkable self-rewarding capability, thereby boosting its inference-time
scaling performance.

Metabolomics presents unique challenges with its complex biochemical pathways,

evaluate LLM capabilities in this domain, we introduce MetaBench, the first

resources, MetaBench evaluates five capabilities essential for metabolomics
research: knowledge, understanding, grounding, reasoning, and research. Our
evaluation of 25 open- and closed-source LLMs reveals distinct performance
patterns across metabolomics tasks: while models perform well on text
generation tasks, cross-database identifier grounding remains challenging even
with retrieval augmentation. Model performance also decreases on long-tail
metabolites with sparse annotations. With MetaBench, we provide essential
infrastructure for developing and evaluating metabolomics AI systems, enabling
systematic progress toward reliable computational tools for metabolomics
research.

TL;DR: 提出IGPO框架，通过信息增益为多轮交互的LLM智能体提供密集内在奖励，解决传统结果奖励稀疏性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于RL的LLM智能体训练依赖最终结果奖励，在多轮交互中面临奖励稀疏、优势崩溃和信用分配困难的问题

Method: IGPO将每轮交互建模为获取真实答案信息的过程，基于策略对正确答案概率的边际增长定义轮级内在奖励，并与结果级监督结合形成密集奖励轨迹

Result: 在领域内和领域外基准测试中，IGPO在多轮场景下始终优于强基线方法，实现了更高准确率和改进的样本效率

Conclusion: IGPO通过内在信息增益奖励有效解决了多轮智能体训练中的奖励稀疏问题，为长轨迹RL训练提供了简单而有效的解决方案

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly trained with
reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance their ability to interact with external
environments through tool use, particularly in search-based settings that
require multi-turn reasoning and knowledge acquisition. However, existing
approaches typically rely on outcome-based rewards that are only provided at
the final answer. This reward sparsity becomes particularly problematic in
multi-turn settings, where long trajectories exacerbate two critical issues:
(i) advantage collapse, where all rollouts receive identical rewards and
provide no useful learning signals, and (ii) lack of fine-grained credit
assignment, where dependencies between turns are obscured, especially in
long-horizon tasks. In this paper, we propose Information Gain-based Policy
Optimization (IGPO), a simple yet effective RL framework that provides dense
and intrinsic supervision for multi-turn agent training. IGPO models each
interaction turn as an incremental process of acquiring information about the
ground truth, and defines turn-level rewards as the marginal increase in the
policy's probability of producing the correct answer. Unlike prior
process-level reward approaches that depend on external reward models or costly
Monte Carlo estimation, IGPO derives intrinsic rewards directly from the
model's own belief updates. These intrinsic turn-level rewards are combined
with outcome-level supervision to form dense reward trajectories. Extensive
experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that
IGPO consistently outperforms strong baselines in multi-turn scenarios,
achieving higher accuracy and improved sample efficiency.

TL;DR: UI-Simulator是一个可扩展的范式，通过生成结构化UI状态和转换来大规模合成训练轨迹，解决了数字代理需要多样化UI轨迹但收集成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字代理需要多样化的大规模UI轨迹来泛化真实世界任务，但收集此类数据在人工标注、基础设施和工程方面成本过高。

Method: 集成数字世界模拟器生成多样化UI状态，引导展开过程实现连贯探索，轨迹包装器产生高质量多样化训练轨迹。提出UI-Simulator-Grow目标扩展策略，优先处理高影响力任务并合成信息丰富的轨迹变体。

Result: 在WebArena和AndroidWorld上的实验表明，UI-Simulator与在真实UI上训练的开源代理相当或更优，具有更好的鲁棒性。UI-Simulator-Grow仅使用Llama-3-8B-Instruct作为基础模型就能达到Llama-3-70B-Instruct的性能。

Conclusion: 目标合成扩展范式具有持续高效增强数字代理的潜力。

Abstract: Digital agents require diverse, large-scale UI trajectories to generalize
across real-world tasks, yet collecting such data is prohibitively expensive in
both human annotation, infra and engineering perspectives. To this end, we
introduce $\textbf{UI-Simulator}$, a scalable paradigm that generates
structured UI states and transitions to synthesize training trajectories at
scale. Our paradigm integrates a digital world simulator for diverse UI states,
a guided rollout process for coherent exploration, and a trajectory wrapper
that produces high-quality and diverse trajectories for agent training. We
further propose $\textbf{UI-Simulator-Grow}$, a targeted scaling strategy that
enables more rapid and data-efficient scaling by prioritizing high-impact tasks
and synthesizes informative trajectory variants. Experiments on WebArena and
AndroidWorld show that UI-Simulator rivals or surpasses open-source agents
trained on real UIs with significantly better robustness, despite using weaker
teacher models. Moreover, UI-Simulator-Grow matches the performance of
Llama-3-70B-Instruct using only Llama-3-8B-Instruct as the base model,
highlighting the potential of targeted synthesis scaling paradigm to
continuously and efficiently enhance the digital agents.

TL;DR: 提出了TokDrift框架，发现代码LLM对语义相同但格式不同的代码变体存在显著行为差异，揭示了子词分词与语法不匹配的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码LLM使用基于统计的子词分词器，而非语法驱动，导致语义相同的代码片段可能因格式差异而被不同分词，影响模型可靠性

Method: 引入TokDrift框架，应用语义保持的重写规则创建仅在分词上不同的代码变体，分析9个代码LLM的行为变化

Result: 即使微小的格式变化也会导致模型行为显著偏移，层间分析显示问题源于早期嵌入层，子词分词未能捕捉语法标记边界

Conclusion: 分词不匹配是代码理解和生成可靠性的隐藏障碍，未来代码LLM需要语法感知的分词方法

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for code rely on subword tokenizers, such as
byte-pair encoding (BPE), learned from mixed natural language text and
programming language code but driven by statistics rather than grammar. As a
result, semantically identical code snippets can be tokenized differently
depending on superficial factors such as whitespace or identifier naming. To
measure the impact of this misalignment, we introduce TokDrift, a framework
that applies semantic-preserving rewrite rules to create code variants
differing only in tokenization. Across nine code LLMs, including large ones
with over 30B parameters, even minor formatting changes can cause substantial
shifts in model behavior. Layer-wise analysis shows that the issue originates
in early embeddings, where subword segmentation fails to capture grammar token
boundaries. Our findings identify misaligned tokenization as a hidden obstacle
to reliable code understanding and generation, highlighting the need for
grammar-aware tokenization for future code LLMs.

*Quan Nguyen-Tri,Mukul Ranjan,Zhiqiang Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了Elastic-Cache方法，通过自适应地重新计算扩散大语言模型中的KV缓存，在保持生成质量的同时显著降低解码延迟。该方法基于三个关键观察，通过注意力感知的漂移测试和深度感知的调度策略，智能决定何时刷新和从哪层开始刷新KV缓存。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在每个去噪步骤和所有层都重新计算所有token的QKV，尽管大多数步骤中KV状态变化很小，特别是在浅层，导致大量冗余计算。这严重影响了扩散大语言模型的解码效率。

Method: 提出Elastic-Cache策略：1) 对远离的MASK token进行块级缓存；2) 基于KV动态随深度增加的观察，从较深层开始选择性刷新；3) 利用最受关注token的KV漂移最小特性，作为其他token缓存变化的保守下界。通过注意力感知漂移测试决定何时刷新，通过深度感知调度决定从哪层刷新。

Result: 在LLaDA-Instruct、LLaDA-1.5和LLaDA-V模型上的实验显示：GSM8K任务加速8.7倍，长序列任务加速45.1倍，HumanEval任务加速4.8倍。在GSM8K上吞吐量比现有基于置信度的方法高6.8倍，同时保持更高的准确率。

Conclusion: Elastic-Cache通过训练无关、架构无关的自适应缓存刷新策略，有效减少了扩散大语言模型中的冗余计算，显著加速解码过程，同时保持生成质量，为扩散大语言模型的实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: This work studies how to adaptively recompute key-value (KV) caches for
diffusion large language models (DLMs) to maximize prediction accuracy while
minimizing decoding latency. Prior methods' decoders recompute QKV for all
tokens at every denoising step and layer, despite KV states changing little
across most steps, especially in shallow layers, leading to substantial
redundancy. We make three observations: (1) distant ${\bf MASK}$ tokens
primarily act as a length-bias and can be cached block-wise beyond the active
prediction window; (2) KV dynamics increase with depth, suggesting that
selective refresh starting from deeper layers is sufficient; and (3) the
most-attended token exhibits the smallest KV drift, providing a conservative
lower bound on cache change for other tokens. Building on these, we propose
${\bf Elastic-Cache}$, a training-free, architecture-agnostic strategy that
jointly decides ${when}$ to refresh (via an attention-aware drift test on the
most-attended token) and ${where}$ to refresh (via a depth-aware schedule that
recomputes from a chosen layer onward while reusing shallow-layer caches and
off-window MASK caches). Unlike fixed-period schemes, Elastic-Cache performs
adaptive, layer-aware cache updates for diffusion LLMs, reducing redundant
computation and accelerating decoding with negligible loss in generation
quality. Experiments on LLaDA-Instruct, LLaDA-1.5, and LLaDA-V across
mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate consistent
speedups: $8.7\times$ on GSM8K (256 tokens), $45.1\times$ on longer sequences,
and $4.8\times$ on HumanEval, while consistently maintaining higher accuracy
than the baseline. Our method achieves significantly higher throughput
($6.8\times$ on GSM8K) than existing confidence-based approaches while
preserving generation quality, enabling practical deployment of diffusion LLMs.

TL;DR: MultiFoodChat是一个基于多智能体推理的零样本食物识别框架，通过视觉-语言模型和大语言模型的对话协作实现无需训练的食物分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督模型依赖大量标注数据且泛化能力有限，需要开发无需训练即可识别新食物类别的零样本方法。

Method: 结合视觉语言模型和大型语言模型，通过多轮视觉-文本对话进行协作推理，使用对象感知令牌捕捉细粒度视觉属性，交互式推理代理动态解释上下文线索。

Result: 在多个公共食物数据集上的实验表明，MultiFoodChat在识别准确性和可解释性方面优于现有的无监督和少样本方法。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了作为智能食品质量检测和分析新范式的潜力，能够灵活理解复杂食物场景而无需额外训练或手动标注。

Abstract: Food image classification plays a vital role in intelligent food quality
inspection, dietary assessment, and automated monitoring. However, most
existing supervised models rely heavily on large labeled datasets and exhibit
limited generalization to unseen food categories. To overcome these challenges,
this study introduces MultiFoodChat, a dialogue-driven multi-agent reasoning
framework for zero-shot food recognition. The framework integrates
vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) to enable
collaborative reasoning through multi-round visual-textual dialogues. An Object
Perception Token (OPT) captures fine-grained visual attributes, while an
Interactive Reasoning Agent (IRA) dynamically interprets contextual cues to
refine predictions. This multi-agent design allows flexible and human-like
understanding of complex food scenes without additional training or manual
annotations. Experiments on multiple public food datasets demonstrate that
MultiFoodChat achieves superior recognition accuracy and interpretability
compared with existing unsupervised and few-shot methods, highlighting its
potential as a new paradigm for intelligent food quality inspection and
analysis.

TL;DR: 该研究将传统视觉模型（YOLO）与视觉语言模型（LLaVA、ChatGPT、Gemini）结合，提升遥感图像中飞机检测和场景理解的准确性和上下文感知能力，在标记和未标记数据以及图像退化场景中均取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉模型在遥感应用中受限于需要大量领域特定标注数据和复杂环境上下文理解能力不足，而视觉语言模型在遥感领域的应用尚未充分探索，因此研究结合两者的优势来提升遥感图像分析能力。

Method: 集成YOLO目标检测模型与多种视觉语言模型（LLaVA、ChatGPT、Gemini），在标记和未标记遥感数据以及图像退化场景下进行性能评估。

Result: 在飞机检测和计数方面，各模型的平均MAE提升了48.46%，在CLIPScore上获得了6.17%的改进，尤其在挑战性条件和退化场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: 传统视觉模型与视觉语言模型的结合为更先进和高效的遥感图像分析铺平了道路，特别是在少样本学习场景中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Remote sensing has become a vital tool across sectors such as urban planning,
environmental monitoring, and disaster response. While the volume of data
generated has increased significantly, traditional vision models are often
constrained by the requirement for extensive domain-specific labelled data and
their limited ability to understand the context within complex environments.
Vision Language Models offer a complementary approach by integrating visual and
textual data; however, their application to remote sensing remains
underexplored, particularly given their generalist nature. This work
investigates the combination of vision models and VLMs to enhance image
analysis in remote sensing, with a focus on aircraft detection and scene
understanding. The integration of YOLO with VLMs such as LLaVA, ChatGPT, and
Gemini aims to achieve more accurate and contextually aware image
interpretation. Performance is evaluated on both labelled and unlabelled remote
sensing data, as well as degraded image scenarios which are crucial for remote
sensing. The findings show an average MAE improvement of 48.46% across models
in the accuracy of aircraft detection and counting, especially in challenging
conditions, in both raw and degraded scenarios. A 6.17% improvement in
CLIPScore for comprehensive understanding of remote sensing images is obtained.
The proposed approach combining traditional vision models and VLMs paves the
way for more advanced and efficient remote sensing image analysis, especially
in few-shot learning scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前列腺癌中的筛状形态是预后不良的组织学特征，但存在报告不足和观察者间变异性的问题，需要提高检测的准确性和一致性。

Method: 使用EfficientNetV2-S编码器和多实例学习的深度学习模型，在640个数字化前列腺核心针活检切片上进行训练，并在多个内部和外部队列中进行验证。

Result: 模型在内部验证中AUC为0.97，Cohen's kappa为0.81；在外部验证中AUC为0.90，Cohen's kappa为0.55；在专家间一致性分析中平均Cohen's kappa为0.66，优于所有九名病理学家。

Conclusion: AI模型在前列腺癌筛状形态检测方面达到病理学家水平，有望提高诊断可靠性、标准化报告并改善患者治疗决策。

Abstract: Background: Cribriform morphology in prostate cancer is a histological
feature that indicates poor prognosis and contraindicates active surveillance.
However, it remains underreported and subject to significant interobserver
variability amongst pathologists. We aimed to develop and validate an AI-based
system to improve cribriform pattern detection.
  Methods: We created a deep learning model using an EfficientNetV2-S encoder
with multiple instance learning for end-to-end whole-slide classification. The
model was trained on 640 digitised prostate core needle biopsies from 430
patients, collected across three cohorts. It was validated internally (261
slides from 171 patients) and externally (266 slides, 104 patients from three
independent cohorts). Internal validation cohorts included laboratories or
scanners from the development set, while external cohorts used completely
independent instruments and laboratories. Annotations were provided by three
expert uropathologists with known high concordance. Additionally, we conducted
an inter-rater analysis and compared the model's performance against nine
expert uropathologists on 88 slides from the internal validation cohort.
  Results: The model showed strong internal validation performance (AUC: 0.97,
95% CI: 0.95-0.99; Cohen's kappa: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.72-0.89) and robust external
validation (AUC: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.86-0.93; Cohen's kappa: 0.55, 95% CI:
0.45-0.64). In our inter-rater analysis, the model achieved the highest average
agreement (Cohen's kappa: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.57-0.74), outperforming all nine
pathologists whose Cohen's kappas ranged from 0.35 to 0.62.
  Conclusion: Our AI model demonstrates pathologist-level performance for
cribriform morphology detection in prostate cancer. This approach could enhance
diagnostic reliability, standardise reporting, and improve treatment decisions
for prostate cancer patients.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对抗净化方法主要针对加性扰动设计，对非加性扰动（如模糊、遮挡、扭曲）效果不佳，而这些扰动在现实世界中很常见。

Method: 首先建立对抗图像的生成过程，然后通过似然最大化分离底层干净图像和扰动参数。

Result: 在GTSRB和CIFAR-10数据集上的实验表明，NAPPure显著提升了图像分类模型对抗非加性扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NAPPure框架有效扩展了对抗净化的适用范围，能够处理现实世界中常见的非加性扰动，为图像分类模型提供了更全面的保护。

Abstract: Adversarial purification has achieved great success in combating adversarial
image perturbations, which are usually assumed to be additive. However,
non-additive adversarial perturbations such as blur, occlusion, and distortion
are also common in the real world. Under such perturbations, existing
adversarial purification methods are much less effective since they are
designed to fit the additive nature. In this paper, we propose an extended
adversarial purification framework named NAPPure, which can further handle
non-additive perturbations. Specifically, we first establish the generation
process of an adversarial image, and then disentangle the underlying clean
image and perturbation parameters through likelihood maximization. Experiments
on GTSRB and CIFAR-10 datasets show that NAPPure significantly boosts the
robustness of image classification models against non-additive perturbations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vgent是一个基于图结构的检索-推理增强生成框架，用于提升大型视频语言模型在长视频理解方面的能力，通过结构化图表示和中间推理步骤解决长视频处理中的时序依赖和信息检索问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视频理解中处理密集视频标记超出上下文窗口和保留长期时序信息的挑战，以及传统RAG方法在视频中面临的时序依赖破坏和无关信息干扰问题。

Method: 提出两个关键创新：1）使用结构化图表示视频，保持视频片段间的语义关系；2）引入中间推理步骤，通过结构化验证减少检索噪声，促进跨片段相关信息聚合。

Result: 在三个长视频理解基准测试中，相比基础模型性能提升3.0%~5.4%，比最先进的视频RAG方法高出8.6%。

Conclusion: Vgent框架通过图结构表示和中间推理机制，有效提升了LVLMs在长视频理解任务中的性能，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over long videos pose significant challenges for
large video language models (LVLMs) due to the difficulty in processing
intensive video tokens beyond context window and retaining long-term sequential
information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated
effectiveness in processing long context for Large Language Models (LLMs);
however, applying RAG to long video faces challenges such as disrupted temporal
dependencies and inclusion of irrelevant information that can hinder accurate
reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Vgent, a novel graph-based
retrieval-reasoning-augmented generation framework to enhance LVLMs for long
video understanding. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (i) It
represents videos by structured graphs with semantic relationships across video
clips preserved to improve retrieval effectiveness. (ii) It introduces an
intermediate reasoning step to mitigate the reasoning limitation of LVLMs,
which leverages structured verification to reduce retrieval noise and
facilitate the explicit aggregation of relevant information across clips,
resulting in more accurate and context-aware responses. We comprehensively
evaluate our framework with various open-source LVLMs on three long-video
understanding benchmarks. Our approach yielded an overall performance
improvement of $3.0\%\sim 5.4\%$ over base models on MLVU, and outperformed
state-of-the-art video RAG methods by $8.6\%$. Our code is publicly available

Motivation: 解决不同场景或生成AI视频中由于主题、背景多样性和非线性时间错位带来的复杂同步挑战。

Method: TPL框架从预训练模型提取的高维嵌入中构建共享的紧凑1D表示，通过学习统一的原型序列来锚定关键动作阶段。

Result: 实验表明TPL在多个数据集上提高了同步准确性、效率和鲁棒性，特别是在细粒度帧检索和阶段分类任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: TPL是首个解决多个生成AI视频同步问题的方法，在多样化视频同步任务中展现出显著优势。

Abstract: Synchronizing videos captured simultaneously from multiple cameras in the
same scene is often easy and typically requires only simple time shifts.
However, synchronizing videos from different scenes or, more recently,
generative AI videos, poses a far more complex challenge due to diverse
subjects, backgrounds, and nonlinear temporal misalignment. We propose Temporal
Prototype Learning (TPL), a prototype-based framework that constructs a shared,
compact 1D representation from high-dimensional embeddings extracted by any of
various pretrained models. TPL robustly aligns videos by learning a unified
prototype sequence that anchors key action phases, thereby avoiding exhaustive
pairwise matching. Our experiments show that TPL improves synchronization
accuracy, efficiency, and robustness across diverse datasets, including
fine-grained frame retrieval and phase classification tasks. Importantly, TPL
is the first approach to mitigate synchronization issues in multiple generative
AI videos depicting the same action. Our code and a new multiple video
synchronization dataset are available at https://bgu-cs-vil.github.io/TPL/

Abstract: We present a novel, zero-shot pipeline for creating hyperrealistic,
identity-preserving 3D avatars from a few unstructured phone images. Existing
methods face several challenges: single-view approaches suffer from geometric
inconsistencies and hallucinations, degrading identity preservation, while
models trained on synthetic data fail to capture high-frequency details like
skin wrinkles and fine hair, limiting realism. Our method introduces two key
contributions: (1) a generative canonicalization module that processes multiple
unstructured views into a standardized, consistent representation, and (2) a
transformer-based model trained on a new, large-scale dataset of high-fidelity
Gaussian splatting avatars derived from dome captures of real people. This
"Capture, Canonicalize, Splat" pipeline produces static quarter-body avatars
with compelling realism and robust identity preservation from unstructured

Abstract: Quantitative analysis of multidimensional biological images is useful for
understanding complex cellular phenotypes and accelerating advances in
biomedical research. As modern microscopy generates ever-larger 2D and 3D
datasets, existing computational approaches are increasingly limited by their
scalability, efficiency, and integration with modern scientific computing
workflows. Existing bioimage analysis tools often lack application programmable
interfaces (APIs), do not support graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration,
lack broad 3D image processing capabilities, and/or have poor interoperability
for compute-heavy workflows. Here, we introduce cubic, an open-source Python
library that addresses these challenges by augmenting widely used SciPy and
scikit-image APIs with GPU-accelerated alternatives from CuPy and RAPIDS cuCIM.
cubic's API is device-agnostic and dispatches operations to GPU when data
reside on the device and otherwise executes on CPU, seamlessly accelerating a
broad range of image processing routines. This approach enables GPU
acceleration of existing bioimage analysis workflows, from preprocessing to
segmentation and feature extraction for 2D and 3D data. We evaluate cubic both
by benchmarking individual operations and by reproducing existing deconvolution
and segmentation pipelines, achieving substantial speedups while maintaining
algorithmic fidelity. These advances establish a robust foundation for
scalable, reproducible bioimage analysis that integrates with the broader
Python scientific computing ecosystem, including other GPU-accelerated methods,
enabling both interactive exploration and automated high-throughput analysis

Abstract: We introduce a framework that enables both multi-view character consistency
and 3D camera control in video diffusion models through a novel customization
data pipeline. We train the character consistency component with recorded
volumetric capture performances re-rendered with diverse camera trajectories
via 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS), lighting variability obtained with a video
relighting model. We fine-tune state-of-the-art open-source video diffusion
models on this data to provide strong multi-view identity preservation, precise
camera control, and lighting adaptability. Our framework also supports core
capabilities for virtual production, including multi-subject generation using
two approaches: joint training and noise blending, the latter enabling
efficient composition of independently customized models at inference time; it
also achieves scene and real-life video customization as well as control over
motion and spatial layout during customization. Extensive experiments show
improved video quality, higher personalization accuracy, and enhanced camera
control and lighting adaptability, advancing the integration of video
generation into virtual production. Our project page is available at:

Motivation: 现有研究主要使用大五人格进行多模态表面人格识别，但缺乏对HEXACO人格的关注，特别是能评估诚实-谦逊特质的HEXACO。同时，机器学习建模时大五人格和HEXACO之间的关系尚未明确。

Method: 通过联合优化识别大五人格和HEXACO人格的方法，从多模态人类行为中自动识别表面人格特质。

Result: 使用自我介绍视频数据集的实验表明，所提方法能有效识别大五人格和HEXACO人格。

Conclusion: 通过联合建模大五人格和HEXACO人格，可以改进对多模态人类行为的认知。

Abstract: This paper proposes a joint modeling method of the Big Five, which has long
been studied, and HEXACO, which has recently attracted attention in psychology,
for automatically recognizing apparent personality traits from multimodal human
behavior. Most previous studies have used the Big Five for multimodal apparent
personality-trait recognition. However, no study has focused on apparent HEXACO
which can evaluate an Honesty-Humility trait related to displaced aggression
and vengefulness, social-dominance orientation, etc. In addition, the
relationships between the Big Five and HEXACO when modeled by machine learning
have not been clarified. We expect awareness of multimodal human behavior to
improve by considering these relationships. The key advance of our proposed
method is to optimize jointly recognizing the Big Five and HEXACO. Experiments
using a self-introduction video dataset demonstrate that the proposed method
can effectively recognize the Big Five and HEXACO.

Motivation: 现有基于图像重建误差的AI生成图像检测方法计算成本高，且无法有效捕捉原始图像中的固有噪声特征。

Method: 使用位平面图像处理技术提取噪声特征，设计最大梯度补丁选择机制计算噪声分数，并开发轻量级分类头结构。

Result: 在GenImage基准测试中达到98.9%的平均准确率，跨生成器泛化能力强，GAN到Diffusion准确率98.2%，Diffusion到GAN准确率99.2%，处理速度比现有方法快近100倍。

Conclusion: 该方法通过位平面噪声分析有效解决了AI生成图像检测问题，在准确率和效率方面均显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of GAN and Diffusion models makes it more difficult to
distinguish AI-generated images from real ones. Recent studies often use
image-based reconstruction errors as an important feature for determining
whether an image is AI-generated. However, these approaches typically incur
high computational costs and also fail to capture intrinsic noisy features
present in the raw images. To solve these problems, we innovatively refine
error extraction by using bit-plane-based image processing, as lower bit planes
indeed represent noise patterns in images. We introduce an effective bit-planes
guided noisy image generation and exploit various image normalization
strategies, including scaling and thresholding. Then, to amplify the noise
signal for easier AI-generated image detection, we design a maximum gradient
patch selection that applies multi-directional gradients to compute the noise
score and selects the region with the highest score. Finally, we propose a
lightweight and effective classification head and explore two different
structures: noise-based classifier and noise-guided classifier. Extensive
experiments on the GenImage benchmark demonstrate the outstanding performance
of our method, which achieves an average accuracy of \textbf{98.9\%}
(\textbf{11.9}\%~$\uparrow$) and shows excellent cross-generator generalization
capability. Particularly, our method achieves an accuracy of over 98.2\% from
GAN to Diffusion and over 99.2\% from Diffusion to GAN. Moreover, it performs
error extraction at the millisecond level, nearly a hundred times faster than
existing methods. The code is at https://github.com/hongsong-wang/LOTA.

Motivation: 传统深度伪造检测方法依赖手动设计的音素-视位对齐阈值、基本帧级一致性检查或单模态检测策略，无法有效识别由GAN、扩散模型和神经渲染技术生成的现代深度伪造内容。这些先进技术能生成近乎完美的单帧图像，但会产生传统检测器经常忽略的微小时间差异。

Method: PIA框架整合了音素序列、唇部几何数据和先进的面部身份嵌入，通过语言、动态面部运动和面部识别线索进行多模态分析，识别跨多个互补模态的不一致性。

Result: 该集成方法显著提高了对细微深度伪造篡改的检测能力，通过识别跨多个互补模态的不一致性来检测深度伪造内容。

Conclusion: PIA框架通过多模态音频-视觉分析有效解决了传统深度伪造检测方法的局限性，能够检测出先进生成模型产生的微小时间差异和篡改痕迹。

Abstract: The rise of manipulated media has made deepfakes a particularly insidious
threat, involving various generative manipulations such as lip-sync
modifications, face-swaps, and avatar-driven facial synthesis. Conventional
detection methods, which predominantly depend on manually designed
phoneme-viseme alignment thresholds, fundamental frame-level consistency
checks, or a unimodal detection strategy, inadequately identify modern-day
deepfakes generated by advanced generative models such as GANs, diffusion
models, and neural rendering techniques. These advanced techniques generate
nearly perfect individual frames yet inadvertently create minor temporal
discrepancies frequently overlooked by traditional detectors. We present a
novel multimodal audio-visual framework, Phoneme-Temporal and Identity-Dynamic
Analysis(PIA), incorporating language, dynamic face motion, and facial
identification cues to address these limitations. We utilize phoneme sequences,
lip geometry data, and advanced facial identity embeddings. This integrated
method significantly improves the detection of subtle deepfake alterations by
identifying inconsistencies across multiple complementary modalities. Code is

Conclusion: EIM调制方案能够充分利用事件视觉传感器的特性，显著提高了基于事件的OCC系统的传输性能，为高速、低延迟的可见光通信提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Optical camera communication (OCC) represents a promising visible light
communication technology. Nonetheless, typical OCC systems utilizing
frame-based cameras are encumbered by limitations, including low bit rate and
high processing load. To address these issues, OCC system utilizing an
event-based vision sensor (EVS) as receivers have been proposed. The EVS
enables high-speed, low-latency, and robust communication due to its
asynchronous operation and high dynamic range. In existing event-based OCC
systems, conventional modulation schemes such as on-off keying (OOK) and pulse
position modulation have been applied, however, to the best of our knowledge,
no modulation method has been proposed that fully exploits the unique
characteristics of the EVS. This paper proposes a novel modulation scheme,
called the event interval modulation (EIM) scheme, specifically designed for
event-based OCC. EIM enables improvement in transmission speed by modulating
information using the intervals between events. This paper proposes a
theoretical model of EIM and conducts a proof-of-concept experiment. First, the
parameters of the EVS are tuned and customized to optimize the frequency
response specifically for EIM. Then, the maximum modulation order usable in EIM
is determined experimentally. We conduct transmission experiments based on the
obtained parameters. Finally, we report successful transmission at 28 kbps over
10 meters and 8.4 kbps over 50 meters in an indoor environment. This sets a new
benchmark for bit rate in event-based OCC systems.

TL;DR: 提出MACE方法，通过混合专家网络和负载均衡策略，在大规模场景中实现高效定位和高质量渲染


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模场景中定位和渲染的计算成本高的问题，现有场景坐标回归方法在扩展到大规模场景时受限于单一网络容量

Method: 引入门控网络隐式分类选择子网络，每次推理只激活单个子网络；提出无辅助损失负载均衡策略提升定位精度

Result: 在剑桥测试集上仅需10分钟训练即可获得高质量渲染结果，显著降低成本同时保持更高精度

Conclusion: MACE框架为大规模场景应用提供了高效解决方案，在减少成本的同时维持高精度

Abstract: Efficient localization and high-quality rendering in large-scale scenes
remain a significant challenge due to the computational cost involved. While
Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) methods perform well in small-scale
localization, they are limited by the capacity of a single network when
extended to large-scale scenes. To address these challenges, we propose the
Mixed Expert-based Accelerated Coordinate Encoding method (MACE), which enables
efficient localization and high-quality rendering in large-scale scenes.
Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of MOE in large model domains, we
introduce a gating network to implicitly classify and select sub-networks,
ensuring that only a single sub-network is activated during each inference.
Furtheremore, we present Auxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing(ALF-LB) strategy to
enhance the localization accuracy on large-scale scene. Our framework provides
a significant reduction in costs while maintaining higher precision, offering
an efficient solution for large-scale scene applications. Additional
experiments on the Cambridge test set demonstrate that our method achieves
high-quality rendering results with merely 10 minutes of training.

Result: 在Wan 2.2 I2V模型和内部模型上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性

Conclusion: IPRO方法能够有效提升图像到视频生成中的人脸身份一致性，无需引入额外模块或改变模型架构

Abstract: Recent advances in image-to-video (I2V) generation have achieved remarkable
progress in synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent videos from static
images. Among all the applications of I2V, human-centric video generation
includes a large portion. However, existing I2V models encounter difficulties
in maintaining identity consistency between the input human image and the
generated video, especially when the person in the video exhibits significant
expression changes and movements. This issue becomes critical when the human
face occupies merely a small fraction of the image. Since humans are highly
sensitive to identity variations, this poses a critical yet under-explored
challenge in I2V generation. In this paper, we propose Identity-Preserving
Reward-guided Optimization (IPRO), a novel video diffusion framework based on
reinforcement learning to enhance identity preservation. Instead of introducing
auxiliary modules or altering model architectures, our approach introduces a
direct and effective tuning algorithm that optimizes diffusion models using a
face identity scorer. To improve performance and accelerate convergence, our
method backpropagates the reward signal through the last steps of the sampling
chain, enabling richer gradient feedback. We also propose a novel facial
scoring mechanism that treats faces in ground-truth videos as facial feature
pools, providing multi-angle facial information to enhance generalization. A
KL-divergence regularization is further incorporated to stabilize training and
prevent overfitting to the reward signal. Extensive experiments on Wan 2.2 I2V
model and our in-house I2V model demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Method: 构建基于大规模偏好数据集的视频奖励模型，包含人工标注和合成失真数据，采用针对多人物一致性的GRPO变体来优化VACE和Phantom。

Conclusion: 该方法为强化学习与个性化视频生成的结合提供了可行见解，显著提升了多人物身份保持能力。

Abstract: While advanced methods like VACE and Phantom have advanced video generation
for specific subjects in diverse scenarios, they struggle with multi-human
identity preservation in dynamic interactions, where consistent identities
across multiple characters are critical. To address this, we propose
Identity-GRPO, a human feedback-driven optimization pipeline for refining
multi-human identity-preserving video generation. First, we construct a video
reward model trained on a large-scale preference dataset containing
human-annotated and synthetic distortion data, with pairwise annotations
focused on maintaining human consistency throughout the video. We then employ a
GRPO variant tailored for multi-human consistency, which greatly enhances both
VACE and Phantom. Through extensive ablation studies, we evaluate the impact of
annotation quality and design choices on policy optimization. Experiments show
that Identity-GRPO achieves up to 18.9% improvement in human consistency
metrics over baseline methods, offering actionable insights for aligning
reinforcement learning with personalized video generation.

TL;DR: 提出MatchAttention机制和MatchDecoder，通过动态匹配相对位置和滑动窗口注意力采样，解决了高分辨率图像跨视图匹配的二次复杂度和遮挡问题，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率图像的跨视图匹配面临二次复杂度和缺乏显式匹配约束的挑战，现有交叉注意力机制难以有效处理这些问题。

Method: 提出MatchAttention机制动态匹配相对位置，使用BilinearSoftmax实现连续可微的滑动窗口注意力采样，设计MatchDecoder作为层次化跨视图解码器，并引入门控交叉MatchAttention和一致性约束损失来处理遮挡。

Result: MatchStereo-B在Middlebury基准测试中平均误差排名第一，KITTI分辨率推理仅需29ms；MatchStereo-T仅用3GB GPU内存即可在0.1秒内处理4K UHD图像；在KITTI 2012、KITTI 2015、ETH3D和Spring flow数据集上均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高精度、低计算复杂度的实时高分辨率跨视图匹配，为实际应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-view matching is fundamentally achieved through cross-attention
mechanisms. However, matching of high-resolution images remains challenging due
to the quadratic complexity and lack of explicit matching constraints in the
existing cross-attention. This paper proposes an attention mechanism,
MatchAttention, that dynamically matches relative positions. The relative
position determines the attention sampling center of the key-value pairs given
a query. Continuous and differentiable sliding-window attention sampling is
achieved by the proposed BilinearSoftmax. The relative positions are
iteratively updated through residual connections across layers by embedding
them into the feature channels. Since the relative position is exactly the
learning target for cross-view matching, an efficient hierarchical cross-view
decoder, MatchDecoder, is designed with MatchAttention as its core component.
To handle cross-view occlusions, gated cross-MatchAttention and a
consistency-constrained loss are proposed. These two components collectively
mitigate the impact of occlusions in both forward and backward passes, allowing
the model to focus more on learning matching relationships. When applied to
stereo matching, MatchStereo-B ranked 1st in average error on the public
Middlebury benchmark and requires only 29ms for KITTI-resolution inference.
MatchStereo-T can process 4K UHD images in 0.1 seconds using only 3GB of GPU
memory. The proposed models also achieve state-of-the-art performance on KITTI
2012, KITTI 2015, ETH3D, and Spring flow datasets. The combination of high
accuracy and low computational complexity makes real-time, high-resolution, and
high-accuracy cross-view matching possible. Code is available at

Conclusion: 混合2D-3D方法具有巨大潜力，通过将2D基础模型与3D重建管道巧妙结合，可以克服各自方法的固有局限性。

Abstract: Scene reconstruction has emerged as a central challenge in computer vision,
with approaches such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting
achieving remarkable progress. While Gaussian Splatting demonstrates strong
performance on large-scale datasets, it often struggles to capture fine details
or maintain realism in regions with sparse coverage, largely due to the
inherent limitations of sparse 3D training data.
  In this work, we propose GauSSmart, a hybrid method that effectively bridges
2D foundational models and 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction. Our approach
integrates established 2D computer vision techniques, including convex
filtering and semantic feature supervision from foundational models such as
DINO, to enhance Gaussian-based scene reconstruction. By leveraging 2D
segmentation priors and high-dimensional feature embeddings, our method guides
the densification and refinement of Gaussian splats, improving coverage in
underrepresented areas and preserving intricate structural details.
  We validate our approach across three datasets, where GauSSmart consistently
outperforms existing Gaussian Splatting in the majority of evaluated scenes.
Our results demonstrate the significant potential of hybrid 2D-3D approaches,
highlighting how the thoughtful combination of 2D foundational models with 3D
reconstruction pipelines can overcome the limitations inherent in either
approach alone.

Abstract: Domain shift in histopathology, often caused by differences in acquisition
processes or data sources, poses a major challenge to the generalization
ability of deep learning models. Existing methods primarily rely on modeling
statistical correlations by aligning feature distributions or introducing
statistical variation, yet they often overlook causal relationships. In this
work, we propose a novel causal-inference-based framework that leverages
semantic features while mitigating the impact of confounders. Our method
implements the front-door principle by designing transformation strategies that
explicitly incorporate mediators and observed tissue slides. We validate our
method on the CAMELYON17 dataset and a private histopathology dataset,
demonstrating consistent performance gains across unseen domains. As a result,
our approach achieved up to a 7% improvement in both the CAMELYON17 dataset and
the private histopathology dataset, outperforming existing baselines. These
results highlight the potential of causal inference as a powerful tool for
addressing domain shift in histopathology image analysis.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently shown promising results on
various multimodal tasks, even achieving human-comparable performance in
certain cases. Nevertheless, LVLMs remain prone to hallucinations -- they often
rely heavily on a single modality or memorize training data without properly
grounding their outputs. To address this, we propose a training-free, tri-layer
contrastive decoding with watermarking, which proceeds in three steps: (1)
select a mature layer and an amateur layer among the decoding layers, (2)
identify a pivot layer using a watermark-related question to assess whether the
layer is visually well-grounded, and (3) apply tri-layer contrastive decoding
to generate the final output. Experiments on public benchmarks such as POPE,
MME and AMBER demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
in reducing hallucinations in LVLMs and generates more visually grounded
responses.

where artifacts such as artificial eyes, printed eye images, or cosmetic
contact lenses are presented to the system. To counteract this, several
presentation attack detection (PAD) methods have been developed. However, there
is a scarcity of datasets for training and evaluating iris PAD techniques due
to the implicit difficulties in constructing and imaging PAs. To address this,
we introduce the Multi-domain Image Translative Diffusion StyleGAN
(MID-StyleGAN), a new framework for generating synthetic ocular images that
captures the PA and bonafide characteristics in multiple domains such as
bonafide, printed eyes and cosmetic contact lens. MID-StyleGAN combines the
strengths of diffusion models and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to
produce realistic and diverse synthetic data. Our approach utilizes a
multi-domain architecture that enables the translation between bonafide ocular
images and different PA domains. The model employs an adaptive loss function
tailored for ocular data to maintain domain consistency. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MID-StyleGAN outperforms existing methods in generating
high-quality synthetic ocular images. The generated data was used to
significantly enhance the performance of PAD systems, providing a scalable
solution to the data scarcity problem in iris and ocular biometrics. For
example, on the LivDet2020 dataset, the true detect rate at 1% false detect
rate improved from 93.41% to 98.72%, showcasing the impact of the proposed
method.

Motivation: 主流多模态大语言模型仅通过文本标记的下一个标记预测进行监督，忽略了视觉中心信息对分析能力的关键作用。

Method: 引入可学习的模块化任务查询(MTQs)和视觉对齐层(VALs)，在多个视觉基础模型的监督下激活特定视觉信号，并使用令牌网关掩码(TGM)协调不同视觉基础模型间的表示冲突。

Result: 大量实验表明，VaCo显著提升了不同多模态大语言模型在各种基准测试上的性能，展现了其在视觉理解方面的卓越能力。

Conclusion: VaCo通过视觉中心激活和协调机制有效解决了多模态大语言模型中视觉信息被忽视的问题，显著提升了模型的视觉理解能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) integrate image features from visual
encoders with LLMs, demonstrating advanced comprehension capabilities. However,
mainstream MLLMs are solely supervised by the next-token prediction of textual
tokens, neglecting critical vision-centric information essential for analytical
abilities. To track this dilemma, we introduce VaCo, which optimizes MLLM
representations through Vision-Centric activation and Coordination from
multiple vision foundation models (VFMs). VaCo introduces visual discriminative
alignment to integrate task-aware perceptual features extracted from VFMs,
thereby unifying the optimization of both textual and visual outputs in MLLMs.
Specifically, we incorporate the learnable Modular Task Queries (MTQs) and
Visual Alignment Layers (VALs) into MLLMs, activating specific visual signals
under the supervision of diverse VFMs. To coordinate representation conflicts
across VFMs, the crafted Token Gateway Mask (TGM) restricts the information
flow among multiple groups of MTQs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VaCo
significantly improves the performance of different MLLMs on various
benchmarks, showcasing its superior capabilities in visual comprehension.

Motivation: 随着消费级深度相机的普及，大量未标记的RGB-D数据可用，需要探索如何利用这些数据进行场景几何推理。

Method: 使用循环一致性关键点作为显著点来增强空间一致性约束，提出结合GRU循环单元和变换同步的新颖位姿模块，融合历史和多视角数据。

Abstract: With the rise in consumer depth cameras, a wealth of unlabeled RGB-D data has
become available. This prompts the question of how to utilize this data for
geometric reasoning of scenes. While many RGB-D registration meth- ods rely on
geometric and feature-based similarity, we take a different approach. We use
cycle-consistent keypoints as salient points to enforce spatial coherence
constraints during matching, improving correspondence accuracy. Additionally,
we introduce a novel pose block that combines a GRU recurrent unit with
transformation synchronization, blending historical and multi-view data. Our
approach surpasses previous self- supervised registration methods on ScanNet
and 3DMatch, even outperforming some older supervised methods. We also
integrate our components into existing methods, showing their effectiveness.

TL;DR: SPR方法通过奖励机制增强多模态大语言模型的空间理解能力，通过语义和定位评分来优化模型生成的区域描述和物体定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在细粒度空间感知方面存在不足，如生成详细区域描述和精确定位物体的能力有限，且无法满足用户对细粒度空间理解的需求。

Method: 提出SPR方法，通过语义和定位评分评估MLLM生成的描述质量，将最佳精炼描述与最低分初始描述配对进行直接偏好优化，增强视觉输入的细粒度对齐。

Result: 在标准参考和定位基准测试中，SPR有效提升了MLLM的空间理解能力，且训练开销最小。

Conclusion: SPR方法能够有效增强MLLMs的细粒度空间感知能力，通过奖励机制优化模型响应质量。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models~(MLLMs) have demonstrated promising spatial
understanding capabilities, such as referencing and grounding object
descriptions. Despite their successes, MLLMs still fall short in fine-grained
spatial perception abilities, such as generating detailed region descriptions
or accurately localizing objects. Additionally, they often fail to respond to
the user's requirements for desired fine-grained spatial understanding. This
issue might arise because existing approaches primarily focus on tuning MLLMs
to model pre-annotated instruction data to inject spatial knowledge, without
direct supervision of MLLMs' actual responses. We address this issue by SPR, a
Spatial Preference Rewarding~(SPR) approach that enhances MLLMs' spatial
capabilities by rewarding MLLMs' detailed responses with precise object
localization over vague or inaccurate responses. With randomly selected image
regions and region descriptions from MLLMs, SPR introduces semantic and
localization scores to comprehensively evaluate the text quality and
localization quality in MLLM-generated descriptions. We also refine the MLLM
descriptions with better localization accuracy and pair the best-scored
refinement with the initial descriptions of the lowest score for direct
preference optimization, thereby enhancing fine-grained alignment with visual
input. Extensive experiments over standard referring and grounding benchmarks
show that SPR improves MLLM spatial understanding capabilities effectively with
minimal overhead in training. Data and code will be released at

TL;DR: DOS是一种通过修改CLIP文本嵌入来改进多对象图像生成的方法，能有效减少对象遗漏和混合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型在处理多对象提示时经常出现对象遗漏或混合的问题，特别是在相似形状、相似纹理、不同背景偏差和多个对象等四种场景下。

Method: 基于CLIP嵌入的两个关键观察，提出DOS方法，在将文本嵌入传递给文本到图像模型之前修改三种类型的CLIP文本嵌入。

Result: 实验结果显示DOS持续提高了多对象图像生成的成功率并减少了对象混合。在人类评估中，DOS显著优于四种竞争方法，在四个基准测试中获得26.24%-43.04%更多的投票。

Conclusion: DOS是改进多对象图像生成的实用有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generative models has led to
significant improvements in generating high-quality images aligned with text
prompts. However, these models still struggle with prompts involving multiple
objects, often resulting in object neglect or object mixing. Through extensive
studies, we identify four problematic scenarios, Similar Shapes, Similar
Textures, Dissimilar Background Biases, and Many Objects, where inter-object
relationships frequently lead to such failures. Motivated by two key
observations about CLIP embeddings, we propose DOS (Directional Object
Separation), a method that modifies three types of CLIP text embeddings before
passing them into text-to-image models. Experimental results show that DOS
consistently improves the success rate of multi-object image generation and
reduces object mixing. In human evaluations, DOS significantly outperforms four
competing methods, receiving 26.24%-43.04% more votes across four benchmarks.
These results highlight DOS as a practical and effective solution for improving
multi-object image generation.

TL;DR: 提出DRBD-Mamba模型，通过双分辨率双向Mamba架构高效解决脑肿瘤分割问题，在保持高精度的同时显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Mamba模型在脑肿瘤分割中存在计算开销大、多轴特征扫描效率低的问题，且对BraTS数据不同分区的鲁棒性评估不足。

Method: 采用空间填充曲线进行3D到1D特征映射，提出门控融合模块自适应整合前后向上下文，使用量化块离散化特征提升鲁棒性，并建立5个系统化折叠进行严格评估。

Conclusion: DRBD-Mamba模型在脑肿瘤分割中实现了精度与效率的良好平衡，证明了其在复杂医疗图像分割任务中的有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation is significant for clinical diagnosis and
treatment. It is challenging due to the heterogeneity of tumor subregions.
Mamba-based State Space Models have demonstrated promising performance.
However, they incur significant computational overhead due to sequential
feature computation across multiple spatial axes. Moreover, their robustness
across diverse BraTS data partitions remains largely unexplored, leaving a
critical gap in reliable evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose
dual-resolution bi-directional Mamba (DRBD-Mamba), an efficient 3D segmentation
model that captures multi-scale long-range dependencies with minimal
computational overhead. We leverage a space-filling curve to preserve spatial
locality during 3D-to-1D feature mapping, thereby reducing reliance on
computationally expensive multi-axial feature scans. To enrich feature
representation, we propose a gated fusion module that adaptively integrates
forward and reverse contexts, along with a quantization block that discretizes
features to improve robustness. In addition, we propose five systematic folds
on BraTS2023 for rigorous evaluation of segmentation techniques under diverse
conditions and present detailed analysis of common failure scenarios. On the
20\% test set used by recent methods, our model achieves Dice improvements of
0.10\% for whole tumor, 1.75\% for tumor core, and 0.93\% for enhancing tumor.
Evaluations on the proposed systematic five folds demonstrate that our model
maintains competitive whole tumor accuracy while achieving clear average Dice
gains of 0.86\% for tumor core and 1.45\% for enhancing tumor over existing
state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our model attains 15 times improvement in
efficiency while maintaining high segmentation accuracy, highlighting its
robustness and computational advantage over existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主板组装级缺陷检测在电子制造中至关重要，但现有研究主要关注裸板或线路级缺陷，组装级检测研究不足。

Method: 提出BoardVision框架，基准测试YOLOv7和Faster R-CNN模型，设计置信度-时间投票集成方法，并在多种真实扰动下评估模型鲁棒性。

Result: YOLOv7精度高但召回率低，Faster R-CNN召回率高但精度低，集成方法有效平衡了精度与召回率，模型在扰动下表现出稳定性挑战。

Conclusion: 计算机视觉技术可从基准结果过渡到实际主板制造质量保证，为组装级缺陷检测提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Motherboard defect detection is critical for ensuring reliability in
high-volume electronics manufacturing. While prior research in PCB inspection
has largely targeted bare-board or trace-level defects, assembly-level
inspection of full motherboards inspection remains underexplored. In this work,
we present BoardVision, a reproducible framework for detecting assembly-level
defects such as missing screws, loose fan wiring, and surface scratches. We
benchmark two representative detectors - YOLOv7 and Faster R-CNN, under
controlled conditions on the MiracleFactory motherboard dataset, providing the
first systematic comparison in this domain. To mitigate the limitations of
single models, where YOLO excels in precision but underperforms in recall and
Faster R-CNN shows the reverse, we propose a lightweight ensemble,
Confidence-Temporal Voting (CTV Voter), that balances precision and recall
through interpretable rules. We further evaluate robustness under realistic
perturbations including sharpness, brightness, and orientation changes,
highlighting stability challenges often overlooked in motherboard defect
detection. Finally, we release a deployable GUI-driven inspection tool that
bridges research evaluation with operator usability. Together, these
contributions demonstrate how computer vision techniques can transition from
benchmark results to practical quality assurance for assembly-level motherboard
manufacturing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学面临千兆像素输入的计算瓶颈和密集标注稀缺的问题，现有方法常忽略多放大倍数下的细粒度信息和肿瘤微环境变化。

Method: 采用易到难的渐进式表示学习，结合双课程对比多实例学习，直接处理全切片图像生成预后预测。

Result: 在12种癌症类型(5,954患者，1254万图块)上的实验显示，DCMIL优于标准WSI预后模型，能识别细粒度预后相关区域并提供不确定性估计。

Conclusion: DCMIL能有效处理WSI进行癌症预后，无需密集标注，可识别形态学差异并生成新的生物学见解。

Abstract: The burgeoning discipline of computational pathology shows promise in
harnessing whole slide images (WSIs) to quantify morphological heterogeneity
and develop objective prognostic modes for human cancers. However, progress is
impeded by the computational bottleneck of gigapixel-size inputs and the
scarcity of dense manual annotations. Current methods often overlook
fine-grained information across multi-magnification WSIs and variations in
tumor microenvironments. Here, we propose an easy-to-hard progressive
representation learning model, termed dual-curriculum contrastive
multi-instance learning (DCMIL), to efficiently process WSIs for cancer
prognosis. The model does not rely on dense annotations and enables the direct
transformation of gigapixel-size WSIs into outcome predictions. Extensive
experiments on twelve cancer types (5,954 patients, 12.54 million tiles)
demonstrate that DCMIL outperforms standard WSI-based prognostic models.
Additionally, DCMIL identifies fine-grained prognosis-salient regions, provides
robust instance uncertainty estimation, and captures morphological differences
between normal and tumor tissues, with the potential to generate new biological
insights. All codes have been made publicly accessible at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经视频压缩方案在处理遮挡、新内容时效率低下，存在帧间误差传播和累积问题，需要手动刷新机制。

Method: 借鉴传统视频编码的帧内编码思想，提出统一帧内/帧间编码框架，每个帧由单一模型自适应处理，并采用双向两帧压缩设计充分利用帧间冗余。

Result: 相比DCVC-RT平均减少10.7%的BD-rate，提供更稳定的每帧码率和质量，同时保持实时编码/解码性能。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了神经视频压缩中的关键限制问题，实现了压缩效率和稳定性的显著提升。

Abstract: Neural video compression (NVC) technologies have advanced rapidly in recent
years, yielding state-of-the-art schemes such as DCVC-RT that offer superior
compression efficiency to H.266/VVC and real-time encoding/decoding
capabilities. Nonetheless, existing NVC schemes have several limitations,
including inefficiency in dealing with disocclusion and new content, interframe
error propagation and accumulation, among others. To eliminate these
limitations, we borrow the idea from classic video coding schemes, which allow
intra coding within inter-coded frames. With the intra coding tool enabled,
disocclusion and new content are properly handled, and interframe error
propagation is naturally intercepted without the need for manual refresh
mechanisms. We present an NVC framework with unified intra and inter coding,
where every frame is processed by a single model that is trained to perform
intra/inter coding adaptively. Moreover, we propose a simultaneous two-frame
compression design to exploit interframe redundancy not only forwardly but also
backwardly. Experimental results show that our scheme outperforms DCVC-RT by an
average of 10.7\% BD-rate reduction, delivers more stable bitrate and quality
per frame, and retains real-time encoding/decoding performances. Code and
models will be released.

Motivation: 视频目标检测在安全关键应用中至关重要，但基于深度学习的检测器容易受到对抗攻击，特别是通用扰动攻击。

Method: 使用核范数正则化促进背景集中的结构化扰动，采用自适应乐观指数梯度方法进行高效优化。

Result: 所提出的攻击方法在效果上优于低秩投影梯度下降和Frank-Wolfe攻击，同时保持高隐蔽性。

Conclusion: 该方法为视频目标检测提供了一种有效且隐蔽的通用对抗攻击方案，相关代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Video-based object detection plays a vital role in safety-critical
applications. While deep learning-based object detectors have achieved
impressive performance, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly those involving universal perturbations. In this work, we propose
a minimally distorted universal adversarial attack tailored for video object
detection, which leverages nuclear norm regularization to promote structured
perturbations concentrated in the background. To optimize this formulation
efficiently, we employ an adaptive, optimistic exponentiated gradient method
that enhances both scalability and convergence. Our results demonstrate that
the proposed attack outperforms both low-rank projected gradient descent and
Frank-Wolfe based attacks in effectiveness while maintaining high stealthiness.

Abstract: Unsupervised deep generative models are emerging as a promising alternative
to supervised methods for detecting and segmenting anomalies in brain imaging.
Unlike fully supervised approaches, which require large voxel-level annotated
datasets and are limited to well-characterised pathologies, these models can be
trained exclusively on healthy data and identify anomalies as deviations from
learned normative brain structures. This PRISMA-guided scoping review
synthesises recent work on unsupervised deep generative models for anomaly
detection in neuroimaging, including autoencoders, variational autoencoders,
generative adversarial networks, and denoising diffusion models. A total of 49
studies published between 2018 - 2025 were identified, covering applications to
brain MRI and, less frequently, CT across diverse pathologies such as tumours,
stroke, multiple sclerosis, and small vessel disease. Reported performance
metrics are compared alongside architectural design choices. Across the
included studies, generative models achieved encouraging performance for large
focal lesions and demonstrated progress in addressing more subtle
abnormalities. A key strength of generative models is their ability to produce
interpretable pseudo-healthy (also referred to as counterfactual)
reconstructions, which is particularly valuable when annotated data are scarce,
as in rare or heterogeneous diseases. Looking ahead, these models offer a
compelling direction for anomaly detection, enabling semi-supervised learning,
supporting the discovery of novel imaging biomarkers, and facilitating within-
and cross-disease deviation mapping in unified end-to-end frameworks. To
realise clinical impact, future work should prioritise anatomy-aware modelling,
development of foundation models, task-appropriate evaluation metrics, and
rigorous clinical validation.

Motivation: 多任务图像恢复模型虽然能同时处理多种图像退化问题，但参数量过大导致计算效率低下，需要压缩模型以提高效率。

Method: 采用迭代剪枝策略，通过多轮移除低幅值权重，同时将剩余权重重置为原始初始化，发现高性能的稀疏子网络。

Result: 在去雨、去雾和去噪任务的基准数据集上，MIR-L仅保留10%的可训练参数，同时维持了高水平的图像恢复性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效压缩了多任务图像恢复模型，在极高稀疏度下仍能保持或超越现有技术性能，为高效图像处理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Image quality is a critical factor in delivering visually appealing content
on web platforms. However, images often suffer from degradation due to lossy
operations applied by online social networks (OSNs), negatively affecting user
experience. Image restoration is the process of recovering a clean high-quality
image from a given degraded input. Recently, multi-task (all-in-one) image
restoration models have gained significant attention, due to their ability to
simultaneously handle different types of image degradations. However, these
models often come with an excessively high number of trainable parameters,
making them computationally inefficient. In this paper, we propose a strategy
for compressing multi-task image restoration models. We aim to discover highly
sparse subnetworks within overparameterized deep models that can match or even
surpass the performance of their dense counterparts. The proposed model, namely
MIR-L, utilizes an iterative pruning strategy that removes low-magnitude
weights across multiple rounds, while resetting the remaining weights to their
original initialization. This iterative process is important for the multi-task
image restoration model's optimization, effectively uncovering "winning
tickets" that maintain or exceed state-of-the-art performance at high sparsity
levels. Experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets for the deraining,
dehazing, and denoising tasks shows that MIR-L retains only 10% of the
trainable parameters while maintaining high image restoration performance. Our
code, datasets and pre-trained models are made publicly available at

Motivation: 放牧活动监测对农业生产和生物多样性保护都很重要，但目前缺乏可扩展的监测方法。

Method: 基于Sentinel-2 L2A时间序列数据，使用CNN-LSTM集成模型对多边形定义的牧场边界进行二分类预测（放牧/未放牧）。

Result: 模型平均F1得分77%，放牧牧场召回率90%；在实际应用中，优先检查模型预测为未放牧的场地，可使确认的非放牧场地数量比随机检查增加17.2倍。

Conclusion: 粗分辨率、免费可用的卫星数据能够可靠地指导检查资源分配，用于保护导向的土地利用合规监测。

Abstract: Grazing shapes both agricultural production and biodiversity, yet scalable
monitoring of where grazing occurs remains limited. We study seasonal grazing
detection from Sentinel-2 L2A time series: for each polygon-defined field
boundary, April-October imagery is used for binary prediction (grazed / not
grazed). We train an ensemble of CNN-LSTM models on multi-temporal reflectance
features, and achieve an average F1 score of 77 percent across five validation
splits, with 90 percent recall on grazed pastures. Operationally, if inspectors
can visit at most 4 percent of sites annually, prioritising fields predicted by
our model as non-grazed yields 17.2 times more confirmed non-grazing sites than
random inspection. These results indicate that coarse-resolution, freely
available satellite data can reliably steer inspection resources for
conservation-aligned land-use compliance. Code and models have been made
publicly available.

Motivation: Vision Mamba相比Vision Transformers(ViTs)具有线性计算复杂度，相比传统卷积神经网络(CNNs)参数更少，在图像分类任务中表现出更高的计算和内存效率。

Method: 使用Vision Mamba作为骨干网络构建神经网络模型，用于预测三维多孔介质的渗透率，并与ViT和CNN模型进行性能比较，同时进行消融研究评估各组件对精度的影响。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有潜力集成到大型视觉模型中，用Vision Mamba替代ViTs，为相关研究提供了可复现的源代码。

Abstract: Vision Mamba has recently received attention as an alternative to Vision
Transformers (ViTs) for image classification. The network size of Vision Mamba
scales linearly with input image resolution, whereas ViTs scale quadratically,
a feature that improves computational and memory efficiency. Moreover, Vision
Mamba requires a significantly smaller number of trainable parameters than
traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and thus, they can be more
memory efficient. Because of these features, we introduce, for the first time,
a neural network that uses Vision Mamba as its backbone for predicting the
permeability of three-dimensional porous media. We compare the performance of
Vision Mamba with ViT and CNN models across multiple aspects of permeability
prediction and perform an ablation study to assess the effects of its
components on accuracy. We demonstrate in practice the aforementioned
advantages of Vision Mamba over ViTs and CNNs in the permeability prediction of
three-dimensional porous media. We make the source code publicly available to
facilitate reproducibility and to enable other researchers to build on and
extend this work. We believe the proposed framework has the potential to be
integrated into large vision models in which Vision Mamba is used instead of
ViTs.

Abstract: Defective surgical instruments pose serious risks to sterility, mechanical
integrity, and patient safety, increasing the likelihood of surgical
complications. However, quality control in surgical instrument manufacturing
often relies on manual inspection, which is prone to human error and
inconsistency. This study introduces SurgScan, an AI-powered defect detection
framework for surgical instruments. Using YOLOv8, SurgScan classifies defects
in real-time, ensuring high accuracy and industrial scalability. The model is
trained on a high-resolution dataset of 102,876 images, covering 11 instrument
types and five major defect categories. Extensive evaluation against
state-of-the-art CNN architectures confirms that SurgScan achieves the highest
accuracy (99.3%) with real-time inference speeds of 4.2-5.8 ms per image,
making it suitable for industrial deployment. Statistical analysis demonstrates
that contrast-enhanced preprocessing significantly improves defect detection,
addressing key limitations in visual inspection. SurgScan provides a scalable,
cost-effective AI solution for automated quality control, reducing reliance on
manual inspection while ensuring compliance with ISO 13485 and FDA standards,
paving the way for enhanced defect detection in medical manufacturing.

TL;DR: 提出了一种噪声投影器方法，通过文本条件优化初始噪声来改善文本到图像生成的对齐问题，无需修改预训练的Stable Diffusion模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像生成中的训练-推理不匹配问题：训练时噪声位于提示特定的子空间，而推理时从提示无关的高斯先验采样，导致生成图像与提示对齐不佳。

Method: 设计噪声投影器，在去噪前对初始噪声进行文本条件优化；通过视觉语言模型获取反馈，蒸馏到奖励模型中，使用准直接偏好优化训练噪声投影器。

Result: 实验表明该方法能显著提高不同提示下的文本-图像对齐质量，且推理成本低，无需多样本选择。

Conclusion: 提出的提示感知噪声投影方法有效解决了训练-推理不匹配问题，提高了文本到图像生成的对齐性能，同时保持了高效推理。

Abstract: In text-to-image generation, different initial noises induce distinct
denoising paths with a pretrained Stable Diffusion (SD) model. While this
pattern could output diverse images, some of them may fail to align well with
the prompt. Existing methods alleviate this issue either by altering the
denoising dynamics or by drawing multiple noises and conducting post-selection.
In this paper, we attribute the misalignment to a training-inference mismatch:
during training, prompt-conditioned noises lie in a prompt-specific subset of
the latent space, whereas at inference the noise is drawn from a
prompt-agnostic Gaussian prior. To close this gap, we propose a noise projector
that applies text-conditioned refinement to the initial noise before denoising.
Conditioned on the prompt embedding, it maps the noise to a prompt-aware
counterpart that better matches the distribution observed during SD training,
without modifying the SD model. Our framework consists of these steps: we first
sample some noises and obtain token-level feedback for their corresponding
images from a vision-language model (VLM), then distill these signals into a
reward model, and finally optimize the noise projector via a quasi-direct
preference optimization. Our design has two benefits: (i) it requires no
reference images or handcrafted priors, and (ii) it incurs small inference
cost, replacing multi-sample selection with a single forward pass. Extensive
experiments further show that our prompt-aware noise projection improves
text-image alignment across diverse prompts.

Abstract: Oral and maxillofacial radiology plays a vital role in dental healthcare, but
radiographic image interpretation is limited by a shortage of trained
professionals. While AI approaches have shown promise, existing dental AI
systems are restricted by their single-modality focus, task-specific design,
and reliance on costly labeled data, hindering their generalization across
diverse clinical scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce DentVFM,
the first family of vision foundation models (VFMs) designed for dentistry.
DentVFM generates task-agnostic visual representations for a wide range of
dental applications and uses self-supervised learning on DentVista, a large
curated dental imaging dataset with approximately 1.6 million multi-modal
radiographic images from various medical centers. DentVFM includes 2D and 3D
variants based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. To address gaps in
dental intelligence assessment and benchmarks, we introduce DentBench, a
comprehensive benchmark covering eight dental subspecialties, more diseases,
imaging modalities, and a wide geographical distribution. DentVFM shows
impressive generalist intelligence, demonstrating robust generalization to
diverse dental tasks, such as disease diagnosis, treatment analysis, biomarker
identification, and anatomical landmark detection and segmentation.
Experimental results indicate DentVFM significantly outperforms supervised,
self-supervised, and weakly supervised baselines, offering superior
generalization, label efficiency, and scalability. Additionally, DentVFM
enables cross-modality diagnostics, providing more reliable results than
experienced dentists in situations where conventional imaging is unavailable.
DentVFM sets a new paradigm for dental AI, offering a scalable, adaptable, and
label-efficient model to improve intelligent dental healthcare and address
critical gaps in global oral healthcare.

TL;DR: PL-SE-ADA是一种用于脑部MR图像域协调和可解释表示学习的框架，通过解耦域不变和域特定特征，在保持疾病相关信息的同时提供高可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像（如MR扫描）存在跨成像站点的域偏移问题，这会降低机器学习在疾病分类等任务中的性能。现有方法虽然有效但缺乏可解释性，这在医疗应用中至关重要。

Method: 提出PL-SE-ADA框架，包含两个编码器分别提取域不变特征和域特定特征，通过对抗训练和图像重建确保协调性和信息保留。通过将输入图像重建为两个特征分量的和来实现可解释性。

Result: 与现有方法相比，PL-SE-ADA在图像重建、疾病分类和域识别方面达到同等或更好的性能，同时能够可视化域独立脑部特征和域特定组件。

Conclusion: PL-SE-ADA不仅实现了有效的域协调，还提供了高可解释性，解决了医疗应用中缺乏可解释性的实际问题。

Abstract: Medical images like MR scans often show domain shifts across imaging sites
due to scanner and protocol differences, which degrade machine learning
performance in tasks such as disease classification. Domain harmonization is
thus a critical research focus. Recent approaches encode brain images
$\boldsymbol{x}$ into a low-dimensional latent space $\boldsymbol{z}$, then
disentangle it into $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ (domain-invariant) and
$\boldsymbol{z_d}$ (domain-specific), achieving strong results. However, these
methods often lack interpretability$-$an essential requirement in medical
applications$-$leaving practical issues unresolved. We propose
Pseudo-Linear-Style Encoder Adversarial Domain Adaptation (PL-SE-ADA), a
general framework for domain harmonization and interpretable representation
learning that preserves disease-relevant information in brain MR images.
PL-SE-ADA includes two encoders $f_E$ and $f_{SE}$ to extract
$\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and $\boldsymbol{z_d}$, a decoder to reconstruct the image
$f_D$, and a domain predictor $g_D$. Beyond adversarial training between the
encoder and domain predictor, the model learns to reconstruct the input image
$\boldsymbol{x}$ by summing reconstructions from $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and
$\boldsymbol{z_d}$, ensuring both harmonization and informativeness. Compared
to prior methods, PL-SE-ADA achieves equal or better performance in image
reconstruction, disease classification, and domain recognition. It also enables
visualization of both domain-independent brain features and domain-specific
components, offering high interpretability across the entire framework.

Method: 提出VisualSplit框架，将图像显式分解为解耦的经典描述符，每个描述符作为独立但互补的视觉知识组件。采用重建驱动的预训练方案，学习捕捉每个视觉描述符的本质同时保持其可解释性。

Result: 通过显式分解视觉属性，该方法在图像生成和编辑等高级视觉任务中实现了有效的属性控制，超越了传统的分类和分割任务。

Conclusion: 这种新的学习方法在视觉理解方面具有有效性，为现代学习从经典视觉线索中受益提供了实证支持。

Abstract: Exploring and understanding efficient image representations is a
long-standing challenge in computer vision. While deep learning has achieved
remarkable progress across image understanding tasks, its internal
representations are often opaque, making it difficult to interpret how visual
information is processed. In contrast, classical visual descriptors (e.g. edge,
colour, and intensity distribution) have long been fundamental to image
analysis and remain intuitively understandable to humans. Motivated by this
gap, we ask a central question: Can modern learning benefit from these
classical cues? In this paper, we answer it with VisualSplit, a framework that
explicitly decomposes images into decoupled classical descriptors, treating
each as an independent but complementary component of visual knowledge. Through
a reconstruction-driven pre-training scheme, VisualSplit learns to capture the
essence of each visual descriptor while preserving their interpretability. By
explicitly decomposing visual attributes, our method inherently facilitates
effective attribute control in various advanced visual tasks, including image
generation and editing, extending beyond conventional classification and
segmentation, suggesting the effectiveness of this new learning approach for
visual understanding. Project page: https://chenyuanqu.com/VisualSplit/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法都是一步调整，对于特征高度纠缠的复杂数据集不够充分，需要多步校正能力来实现更精确和鲁棒的对齐。

Method: 使用固定耦合策略确保训练时类别对应，提出噪声增强策略缓解数据稀缺问题，设计早停求解器提前终止变换过程以提高效率和精度。

Result: 在多个基准测试和骨干网络上均能显著提升性能，特别是在具有挑战性的数据集上表现突出。

Conclusion: FMA通过多步校正能力实现了比一步PEFT方法更精确和鲁棒的跨模态特征对齐。

Abstract: Aligning features from different modalities, is one of the most fundamental
challenges for cross-modal tasks. Although pre-trained vision-language models
can achieve a general alignment between image and text, they often require
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for further adjustment. Today's PEFT
methods (e.g., prompt tuning, LoRA-based, or adapter-based) always selectively
fine-tune a subset of parameters, which can slightly adjust either visual or
textual features, and avoid overfitting. In this paper, we are the first to
highlight that all existing PEFT methods perform one-step adjustment. It is
insufficient for complex (or difficult) datasets, where features of different
modalities are highly entangled. To this end, we propose the first
model-agnostic multi-step adjustment approach by learning a cross-modal
velocity field: Flow Matching Alignment (FMA). Specifically, to ensure the
correspondence between categories during training, we first utilize a fixed
coupling strategy. Then, we propose a noise augmentation strategy to alleviate
the data scarcity issue. Finally, we design an early-stopping solver, which
terminates the transformation process earlier, improving both efficiency and
accuracy. Compared with one-step PEFT methods, FMA has the multi-step
rectification ability to achieve more precise and robust alignment. Extensive
results have demonstrated that FMA can consistently yield significant
performance gains across various benchmarks and backbones, particularly on
challenging datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Scene De-Contextualization (SDeC)的训练免费方法，通过抑制文本到图像生成中固有的场景-身份相关性来解决身份偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成方法在保持身份一致性方面存在身份偏移问题，且通常需要预先知道所有目标场景，这在现实应用中不切实际。

Method: 通过量化SVD方向稳定性来自适应重新加权特征值，识别并抑制身份提示嵌入中的潜在场景-身份相关性。

Result: 实验表明SDeC显著增强了身份保持能力，同时保持了场景多样性。

Conclusion: SDeC提供了一种高效、灵活且通用的解决方案，适用于现实世界应用，无需预先知道所有目标场景。

Abstract: Consistent text-to-image (T2I) generation seeks to produce
identity-preserving images of the same subject across diverse scenes, yet it
often fails due to a phenomenon called identity (ID) shift. Previous methods
have tackled this issue, but typically rely on the unrealistic assumption of
knowing all target scenes in advance. This paper reveals that a key source of
ID shift is the native correlation between subject and scene context, called
scene contextualization, which arises naturally as T2I models fit the training
distribution of vast natural images. We formally prove the near-universality of
this scene-ID correlation and derive theoretical bounds on its strength. On
this basis, we propose a novel, efficient, training-free prompt embedding
editing approach, called Scene De-Contextualization (SDeC), that imposes an
inversion process of T2I's built-in scene contextualization. Specifically, it
identifies and suppresses the latent scene-ID correlation within the ID
prompt's embedding by quantifying the SVD directional stability to adaptively
re-weight the corresponding eigenvalues. Critically, SDeC allows for per-scene
use (one scene per prompt) without requiring prior access to all target scenes.
This makes it a highly flexible and general solution well-suited to real-world
applications where such prior knowledge is often unavailable or varies over
time. Experiments demonstrate that SDeC significantly enhances identity
preservation while maintaining scene diversity.

Conclusion: BalanceGS通过算法-系统协同设计有效解决了3DGS训练效率问题，显著提升了训练速度。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising 3D reconstruction
technique. The traditional 3DGS training pipeline follows three sequential
steps: Gaussian densification, Gaussian projection, and color splatting.
Despite its promising reconstruction quality, this conventional approach
suffers from three critical inefficiencies: (1) Skewed density allocation
during Gaussian densification, (2) Imbalanced computation workload during
Gaussian projection and (3) Fragmented memory access during color splatting.
  To tackle the above challenges, we introduce BalanceGS, the algorithm-system
co-design for efficient training in 3DGS. (1) At the algorithm level, we
propose heuristic workload-sensitive Gaussian density control to automatically
balance point distributions - removing 80% redundant Gaussians in dense regions
while filling gaps in sparse areas. (2) At the system level, we propose
Similarity-based Gaussian sampling and merging, which replaces the static
one-to-one thread-pixel mapping with adaptive workload distribution - threads
now dynamically process variable numbers of Gaussians based on local cluster
density. (3) At the mapping level, we propose reordering-based memory access
mapping strategy that restructures RGB storage and enables batch loading in
shared memory.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with 3DGS, our approach
achieves a 1.44$\times$ training speedup on a NVIDIA A100 GPU with negligible
quality degradation.

Abstract: This paper presents CALM-Net, a curvature-aware LiDAR point cloud-based
multi-branch neural network for vehicle re-identification. The proposed model
addresses the challenge of learning discriminative and complementary features
from three-dimensional point clouds to distinguish between vehicles. CALM-Net
employs a multi-branch architecture that integrates edge convolution, point
attention, and a curvature embedding that characterizes local surface variation
in point clouds. By combining these mechanisms, the model learns richer
geometric and contextual features that are well suited for the
re-identification task. Experimental evaluation on the large-scale nuScenes

improvement of approximately 1.97\% points compared with the strongest baseline

Conclusion: 该双向框架为关键点引导的图像理解和语言引导的精确定位提供了新的可能性，代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in cross-modal
understanding. Yet, these models remain limited to object-level or region-level
grounding, lacking the capability for pixel-precise keypoint comprehension
through natural language. We introduce a novel framework for pixel level
grounding. The framework consists of two complementary components: a Point
Descriptor that generates rich, contextual descriptions of individual
keypoints, and a Point Localizer that regresses precise pixel coordinates from
these descriptions. Unlike prior work that relies on templated prompts or
keypoint names, our approach produces free-form, coarse-to-fine descriptions
that situate keypoints within their visual context. Since there is no available
dataset to train such a system, we introduce LlamaPointInPart, a carefully
curated dataset of 20K+ image-keypoint-description triplets synthesized from
multiple vision-language models, capturing multi-scale information from
scene-level context to visual features around the keypoint. For cross-category
generalization, we optimize the Point Descriptor on AP-10K via GRPO, using the
frozen Point Localizer as a reward model to produce descriptions that maximize
localization accuracy. To evaluate our results we establish a new evaluation
protocol. Instead of comparing the text description produced by our method to
the ground truth, we use the localizer to determine how close is the predicted
point generated to the ground truth point. Experiments demonstrate superior
performance compared to baseline models on LlamaPointInPart.The bidirectional
nature of our framework should enable future applications in both
keypoint-guided image understanding and language-guided precise localization.
Our code and dataset are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成方法在保持物体运动连贯性和交互方面存在困难，主要瓶颈包括：人类提供的运动提示在编码后有效token过少，以及单头优化倾向于纹理而非时间一致性。

Method: 1. 实例线索：将稀疏的用户可编辑提示转换为密集的2.5D运动场；2. 密集RoPE：在token空间中保持线索显著性，使用空间可寻址旋转嵌入标记运动token；3. 联合RGB+辅助图预测，分离结构和外观处理。

Result: 该方法减少了深度模糊性，稳定了优化过程，提高了时间连贯性，无需逐帧轨迹脚本。

Conclusion: STANCE通过简单有效的组件解决了视频生成中的运动一致性问题，在保持易用性的同时显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Video generation has recently made striking visual progress, but maintaining
coherent object motion and interactions remains difficult. We trace two
practical bottlenecks: (i) human-provided motion hints (e.g., small 2D maps)
often collapse to too few effective tokens after encoding, weakening guidance;
and (ii) optimizing for appearance and motion in a single head can favor
texture over temporal consistency. We present STANCE, an image-to-video
framework that addresses both issues with two simple components. First, we
introduce Instance Cues -- a pixel-aligned control signal that turns sparse,
user-editable hints into a dense 2.5D (camera-relative) motion field by
averaging per-instance flow and augmenting with monocular depth over the
instance mask. This reduces depth ambiguity compared to 2D arrow inputs while
remaining easy to use. Second, we preserve the salience of these cues in token
space with Dense RoPE, which tags a small set of motion tokens (anchored on the
first frame) with spatial-addressable rotary embeddings. Paired with joint RGB
\(+\) auxiliary-map prediction (segmentation or depth), our model anchors
structure while RGB handles appearance, stabilizing optimization and improving
temporal coherence without requiring per-frame trajectory scripts.

Motivation: 现有动物分类模型如SpeciesNet采用保守的汇总策略，导致许多动物仅被标记在高层级分类而非物种级别，需要更精细的物种识别方法。

Method: 五阶段流水线：高置信度接受、鸟类覆盖、质心构建、三元组损失度量学习和自适应余弦距离评分，结合SpeciesNet EfficientNetV2-M预测与CLIP嵌入。

Result: 在LILA BC Desert Lion Conservation数据集上，从"空白"和"动物"标签中恢复了761个鸟类检测，重新分类了456个标记为动物、哺乳动物或空白的检测，准确率达96.5%，64.9%实现了物种级识别。

Conclusion: 该层次化重分类系统能有效提升动物检测的物种级识别能力，显著改善高层级分类标签的细化效果。

Abstract: State-of-the-art animal classification models like SpeciesNet provide
predictions across thousands of species but use conservative rollup strategies,
resulting in many animals labeled at high taxonomic levels rather than species.
We present a hierarchical re-classification system for the Animal Detect
platform that combines SpeciesNet EfficientNetV2-M predictions with CLIP
embeddings and metric learning to refine high-level taxonomic labels toward
species-level identification. Our five-stage pipeline (high-confidence
acceptance, bird override, centroid building, triplet-loss metric learning, and
adaptive cosine-distance scoring) is evaluated on a segment of the LILA BC
Desert Lion Conservation dataset (4,018 images, 15,031 detections). After
recovering 761 bird detections from "blank" and "animal" labels, we re-classify
456 detections labeled animal, mammal, or blank with 96.5% accuracy, achieving
species-level identification for 64.9 percent

TL;DR: 评估零样本方法在野生动物图像分类中的应用，使用自监督视觉变换器，比较不同架构和聚类方法，在5个物种测试集上达到88.6%准确率，并将连续相似性排序部署到生产环境中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机陷阱生成数百万张野生动物图像，但许多数据集包含现有分类器未涵盖的物种，需要零样本方法来组织未标记的野生动物图像。

Method: 使用自监督视觉变换器（CLIP、DINOv2、MegaDescriptor）结合无监督聚类方法（DBSCAN、GMM）和降维技术（PCA、UMAP），并通过t-SNE投影实现连续1D相似性排序。

Result: 在5个物种测试集上，DINOv2与UMAP和GMM组合达到88.6%准确率（宏F1=0.874），1D排序在哺乳动物和鸟类上达到88.2%一致性，在鱼类上达到95.2%一致性。

Conclusion: 基于这些发现，将连续相似性排序部署到生产环境中，能够快速进行探索性分析并加速生物多样性监测的手动标注工作流程。

Abstract: Camera traps generate millions of wildlife images, yet many datasets contain
species that are absent from existing classifiers. This work evaluates
zero-shot approaches for organizing unlabeled wildlife imagery using
self-supervised vision transformers, developed and tested within the Animal
Detect platform for camera trap analysis. We compare unsupervised clustering
methods (DBSCAN, GMM) across three architectures (CLIP, DINOv2, MegaDescriptor)
combined with dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, UMAP), and we
demonstrate continuous 1D similarity ordering via t-SNE projection. On a
5-species test set with ground truth labels used only for evaluation, DINOv2
with UMAP and GMM achieves 88.6 percent accuracy (macro-F1 = 0.874), while 1D
sorting reaches 88.2 percent coherence for mammals and birds and 95.2 percent
for fish across 1,500 images. Based on these findings, we deployed continuous
similarity ordering in production, enabling rapid exploratory analysis and
accelerating manual annotation workflows for biodiversity monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Wiki-PRF三阶段方法，通过处理、检索和过滤阶段改进知识库视觉问答任务，使用强化学习训练视觉语言模型，在基准数据集上取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强生成方法在知识库视觉问答任务中面临多模态查询质量不高和检索结果相关性不足的问题，需要改进。

Method: 提出三阶段Wiki-PRF方法：处理阶段动态调用视觉工具提取多模态信息；检索阶段整合视觉和文本特征进行多模态知识检索；过滤阶段进行相关性过滤和集中。使用强化学习训练视觉语言模型，以答案准确性和格式一致性作为奖励信号。

Result: 在E-VQA和InfoSeek基准数据集上分别实现了36.0和42.8的显著性能提升，达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: Wiki-PRF方法通过三阶段处理和强化学习训练，有效提升了知识库视觉问答任务的性能，解决了多模态查询质量和检索结果相关性的挑战。

Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires visual language
models (VLMs) to integrate visual understanding with external knowledge
retrieval. Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) achieves significant
advances in this task by combining knowledge-base querying, it still struggles
with the quality of multimodal queries and the relevance of retrieved results.
To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel three-stage method, termed
Wiki-PRF, including Processing, Retrieval and Filtering stages. The processing
stage dynamically invokes visual tools to extract precise multimodal
information for retrieval. The retrieval stage integrates visual and text
features to achieve multimodal knowledge retrieval. The filtering stage
performs relevance filtering and concentration on retrieval results. To this
end, we introduce a visual language model trained with answer accuracy and
format consistency as reward signals via a reinforcement learning manner. This
enhances the model's reasoning, tool invocation for accurate queries, and
filtering of irrelevant content. Experiments on benchmark datasets (E-VQA and
InfoSeek) show significant improvements~(36.0 and 42.8) in answer quality,
achieving state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Shot2Tactic-Caption是一个羽毛球视频语义和时序多尺度字幕生成框架，能够生成描述单个动作的击球级字幕和捕捉战术执行过程的战术级字幕。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 羽毛球战术理解不仅需要解释单个动作，还需要理解战术如何随时间动态执行。现有方法缺乏对战术执行过程的描述能力。

Method: 采用双分支设计，包含视觉编码器、时空Transformer编码器和基于Transformer的解码器。引入战术单元检测器识别有效战术单元、类型和状态，并通过击球级提示引导机制将预测的战术类型和状态作为提示注入解码器。

Result: 实验结果表明该框架在生成击球和战术字幕方面有效。消融研究显示基于ResNet50的时空编码器优于其他变体，击球级提示结构能产生更连贯准确的战术字幕。

Conclusion: 提出的Shot2Tactic-Caption框架能够有效生成羽毛球视频的多尺度字幕，特别是能够描述成功执行的战术以及被暂时中断后恢复的战术执行过程。

Abstract: Tactical understanding in badminton involves interpreting not only individual
actions but also how tactics are dynamically executed over time. In this paper,
we propose \textbf{Shot2Tactic-Caption}, a novel framework for semantic and
temporal multi-scale video captioning in badminton, capable of generating
shot-level captions that describe individual actions and tactic-level captions
that capture how these actions unfold over time within a tactical execution. We
also introduce the Shot2Tactic-Caption Dataset, the first badminton captioning
dataset containing 5,494 shot captions and 544 tactic captions.
Shot2Tactic-Caption adopts a dual-branch design, with both branches including a
visual encoder, a spatio-temporal Transformer encoder, and a Transformer-based
decoder to generate shot and tactic captions. To support tactic captioning, we
additionally introduce a Tactic Unit Detector that identifies valid tactic
units, tactic types, and tactic states (e.g., Interrupt, Resume). For tactic
captioning, we further incorporate a shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism, where
the predicted tactic type and state are embedded as prompts and injected into
the decoder via cross-attention. The shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism enables
our system not only to describe successfully executed tactics but also to
capture tactical executions that are temporarily interrupted and later resumed.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in
generating both shot and tactic captions. Ablation studies show that the
ResNet50-based spatio-temporal encoder outperforms other variants, and that
shot-wise prompt structuring leads to more coherent and accurate tactic
captioning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Efficient Video Sampling (EVS)方法，通过识别和修剪时间上静态的补丁来减少视频中的令牌冗余，无需架构更改或重新训练，显著降低令牌数量同时保持语义保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型从静态图像理解扩展到视频推理时，处理密集帧序列的二次成本限制了其可扩展性，长视频往往超出语言模型的令牌预算，导致严重的上下文限制和延迟问题。

Method: EVS是一种即插即用的方法，通过识别和修剪时间上静态的补丁（在连续帧中保持不变的空间区域）来减少视频令牌冗余，保留位置身份。

Result: EVS在推理时可将大型语言模型的首次令牌时间减少高达4倍，且精度损失最小。结合随机修剪率的上训练阶段，EVS产生对不同程度压缩具有鲁棒性的模型，在激进修剪下保持完整性能。

Conclusion: EVS持续改善效率-精度权衡，在不牺牲质量的情况下实现可扩展的视频语言理解。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently expanded from static image
understanding to video reasoning, but their scalability is fundamentally
limited by the quadratic cost of processing dense frame sequences. Long videos
often exceed the token budget of modern language models, leading to severe
context limitations and latency issues. We introduce Efficient Video Sampling
(EVS), a simple, plug-and-play method for reducing token redundancy in videos
by identifying and pruning temporally static patches -- spatial regions that
remain unchanged across consecutive frames. EVS preserves positional identity,
requires no architectural changes or retraining. We show that EVS substantially
reduces token count while maintaining semantic fidelity, enabling faster
inference and longer input sequences. Applied at inference time, EVS reduces
large language model (LLM) time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 4x with minimal
accuracy loss. When combined with an uptraining phase using stochastic pruning
rates, EVS yields models that are robust to varying compression levels and
retain full performance under aggressive pruning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EVS consistently improves efficiency-accuracy trade-offs,
unlocking scalable video-language understanding without sacrificing quality.

TL;DR: RepTok是一个生成建模框架，使用自监督视觉变换器的单个连续潜在令牌表示图像，通过微调语义令牌嵌入和生成解码器实现高效图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决2D潜在空间的空间冗余问题，降低训练成本，同时保持自监督学习空间的良好几何特性，实现高效的生成建模。

Method: 基于预训练的SSL编码器，仅微调语义令牌嵌入，与使用流匹配目标的生成解码器联合训练，添加余弦相似度损失正则化适应后的令牌。

Result: 在类别条件ImageNet生成上取得竞争性结果，在MS-COCO上以极有限的训练预算达到竞争性的零样本文本到图像合成性能。

Conclusion: 微调的自监督学习表示可以作为紧凑有效的潜在空间，用于高效的生成建模。

Abstract: We introduce Representation Tokenizer (RepTok), a generative modeling
framework that represents an image using a single continuous latent token
obtained from self-supervised vision transformers. Building on a pre-trained
SSL encoder, we fine-tune only the semantic token embedding and pair it with a
generative decoder trained jointly using a standard flow matching objective.
This adaptation enriches the token with low-level, reconstruction-relevant
details, enabling faithful image reconstruction. To preserve the favorable
geometry of the original SSL space, we add a cosine-similarity loss that
regularizes the adapted token, ensuring the latent space remains smooth and
suitable for generation. Our single-token formulation resolves spatial
redundancies of 2D latent spaces and significantly reduces training costs.
Despite its simplicity and efficiency, RepTok achieves competitive results on
class-conditional ImageNet generation and naturally extends to text-to-image
synthesis, reaching competitive zero-shot performance on MS-COCO under
extremely limited training budgets. Our findings highlight the potential of
fine-tuned SSL representations as compact and effective latent spaces for
efficient generative modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于扩散的测试时适应方法依赖梯度引导，限制了探索能力和跨失真类型的泛化能力的问题。

Method: 采用Feynman-Kac引导机制，维护多个粒子轨迹，通过累积top-K概率和熵调度来平衡探索和置信度，使用伪标签驱动的奖励来引导扩散过程。

Result: 在ImageNet-C数据集上，SteeringTTA始终优于基线方法，且不需要任何模型更新或源数据。

Conclusion: SteeringTTA提供了一种有效的测试时适应方法，通过引导扩散过程改善了在分布偏移下的分类性能。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to correct performance degradation of deep
models under distribution shifts by updating models or inputs using unlabeled
test data. Input-only diffusion-based TTA methods improve robustness for
classification to corruptions but rely on gradient guidance, limiting
exploration and generalization across distortion types. We propose SteeringTTA,
an inference-only framework that adapts Feynman-Kac steering to guide
diffusion-based input adaptation for classification with rewards driven by
pseudo-label. SteeringTTA maintains multiple particle trajectories, steered by
a combination of cumulative top-K probabilities and an entropy schedule, to
balance exploration and confidence. On ImageNet-C, SteeringTTA consistently
outperforms the baseline without any model updates or source data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种低成本预训练策略，通过上下文学习从非配对视频片段中学习视频编辑能力，显著提升了基于指令的视频编辑效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于指令的图像编辑发展迅速，但扩展到视频领域面临挑战，主要因为构建大规模配对视频编辑数据集成本高昂且复杂。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：首先在约100万真实视频片段上进行预训练学习基本编辑概念，然后在少于15万精心策划的编辑对上进行微调。

Result: 实验表明该方法在指令对齐和视觉保真度方面均优于现有方法，编辑指令跟随能力提升12%，编辑质量提升15%。

Conclusion: 该预训练策略能有效赋予基础视频生成模型通用编辑能力，为基于指令的视频编辑提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of instruction-based image editing, its extension
to video remains underexplored, primarily due to the prohibitive cost and
complexity of constructing large-scale paired video editing datasets. To
address this challenge, we introduce a low-cost pretraining strategy for
instruction-based video editing that leverages in-context learning from
unpaired video clips. We show that pretraining a foundation video generation
model with this strategy endows it with general editing capabilities, such as
adding, replacing, or deleting operations, according to input editing
instructions. The pretrained model can then be efficiently refined with a small
amount of high-quality paired editing data. Built upon HunyuanVideoT2V, our
framework first pretrains on approximately 1M real video clips to learn basic
editing concepts, and subsequently fine-tunes on fewer than 150k curated
editing pairs to extend more editing tasks and improve the editing quality.
Comparative experiments show that our method surpasses existing
instruction-based video editing approaches in both instruction alignment and
visual fidelity, achieving a 12\% improvement in editing instruction following
and a 15\% improvement in editing quality.

TL;DR: 将去相关反向传播(DBP)集成到MAE预训练中，通过减少输入相关性来加速收敛，在保持性能的同时显著降低训练时间和碳排放


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAE预训练虽然性能优秀但计算成本高昂，在工业应用中不实用，需要找到加速训练的方法

Method: 在MAE预训练的编码器中选择性应用DBP优化方法，迭代减少各层的输入相关性

Result: DBP-MAE将训练时间减少21.1%，碳排放降低21.4%，分割mIoU提升1.1个百分点，在工业数据上也获得类似收益

Conclusion: DBP能够在大规模ViT预训练中同时减少训练时间、能源消耗并提升下游任务性能

Abstract: Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pre-training of vision transformers (ViTs) yields
strong performance in low-label regimes but comes with substantial
computational costs, making it impractical in time- and resource-constrained
industrial settings. We address this by integrating Decorrelated
Backpropagation (DBP) into MAE pre-training, an optimization method that
iteratively reduces input correlations at each layer to accelerate convergence.
Applied selectively to the encoder, DBP achieves faster pre-training without
loss of stability. On ImageNet-1K pre-training with ADE20K fine-tuning, DBP-MAE
reduces wall-clock time to baseline performance by 21.1%, lowers carbon
emissions by 21.4% and improves segmentation mIoU by 1.1 points. We observe
similar gains when pre-training and fine-tuning on proprietary industrial data,
confirming the method's applicability in real-world scenarios. These results
demonstrate that DBP can reduce training time and energy use while improving
downstream performance for large-scale ViT pre-training.

Motivation: 采矿活动是环境退化的重要来源，但现有数据集在时间深度和地理范围上有限，需要长期一致的采矿诱发地表变化监测来支持可持续资源管理和环境治理。

Method: 构建EuroMineNet数据集，支持两个可持续性驱动任务：多时序采矿足迹映射（使用新的变化感知时序IoU指标评估）和跨时序变化检测。基准测试了20个最先进的深度学习模型。

Result: GeoAI方法能有效识别长期环境变化，但在检测对及时缓解至关重要的短期动态方面仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: EuroMineNet通过推进时间一致且可解释的采矿监测，有助于可持续土地利用管理、环境韧性，以及更广泛的GeoAI社会和环境应用目标。

Abstract: Mining activities are essential for industrial and economic development, but
remain a leading source of environmental degradation, contributing to
deforestation, soil erosion, and water contamination. Sustainable resource
management and environmental governance require consistent, long-term
monitoring of mining-induced land surface changes, yet existing datasets are
often limited in temporal depth or geographic scope. To address this gap, we
present EuroMineNet, the first comprehensive multitemporal benchmark for mining
footprint mapping and monitoring based on Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery.
Spanning 133 mining sites across the European Union, EuroMineNet provides
annual observations and expert-verified annotations from 2015 to 2024, enabling
GeoAI-based models to analyze environmental dynamics at a continental scale. It
supports two sustainability-driven tasks: (1) multitemporal mining footprint
mapping for consistent annual land-use delineation, evaluated with a novel
Change-Aware Temporal IoU (CA-TIoU) metric, and (2) cross-temporal change
detection to capture both gradual and abrupt surface transformations.
Benchmarking 20 state-of-the-art deep learning models reveals that while GeoAI
methods effectively identify long-term environmental changes, challenges remain
in detecting short-term dynamics critical for timely mitigation. By advancing
temporally consistent and explainable mining monitoring, EuroMineNet
contributes to sustainable land-use management, environmental resilience, and
the broader goal of applying GeoAI for social and environmental good. We
release the codes and datasets by aligning with FAIR and the open science
paradigm at https://github.com/EricYu97/EuroMineNet.

TL;DR: 提出了首个弱监督链式知识蒸馏网络WeCKD，通过构建渐进式蒸馏链，让每个模型不仅从前驱模型学习知识，还能在传递前精炼知识，从而在有限数据场景下实现高效知识迁移。


<details>

Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏依赖静态师生框架，存在知识退化、监督效率低、需要强教师模型或大量标注数据等问题，限制了在真实世界有限数据场景下的有效性。

Method: 构建弱监督链式知识蒸馏网络，形成渐进式蒸馏链，每个模型仅使用部分数据集进行训练，通过结构化知识传递增强特征学习并减少数据依赖。

Result: 在四个耳镜成像数据集上的评估显示，该方法不仅匹配而且经常超越现有监督方法的性能；在其他两个数据集上的实验进一步证明了其在多种医学成像模态（包括显微和磁共振成像）上的泛化能力；相比在相同有限数据上训练的单骨干网络，累积准确率提升高达+23%。

Conclusion: WeCKD通过链式知识蒸馏结构有效解决了传统知识蒸馏的局限性，在有限数据场景下实现了高效学习，具有实际应用的潜力。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has traditionally relied on a static
teacher-student framework, where a large, well-trained teacher transfers
knowledge to a single student model. However, these approaches often suffer
from knowledge degradation, inefficient supervision, and reliance on either a
very strong teacher model or large labeled datasets, which limits their
effectiveness in real-world, limited-data scenarios. To address these, we
present the first-ever Weakly-supervised Chain-based KD network (WeCKD) that
redefines knowledge transfer through a structured sequence of interconnected
models. Unlike conventional KD, it forms a progressive distillation chain,
where each model not only learns from its predecessor but also refines the
knowledge before passing it forward. This structured knowledge transfer further
enhances feature learning, reduces data dependency, and mitigates the
limitations of one-step KD. Each model in the distillation chain is trained on
only a fraction of the dataset and demonstrates that effective learning can be
achieved with minimal supervision. Extensive evaluations across four otoscopic
imaging datasets demonstrate that it not only matches but in many cases
surpasses the performance of existing supervised methods. Experimental results
on two other datasets further underscore its generalization across diverse
medical imaging modalities, including microscopic and magnetic resonance
imaging. Furthermore, our evaluations resulted in cumulative accuracy gains of
up to +23% over a single backbone trained on the same limited data, which
highlights its potential for real-world adoption.

Abstract: In recent years, video question answering based on multimodal large language
models (MLLM) has garnered considerable attention, due to the benefits from the
substantial advancements in LLMs. However, these models have a notable
deficiency in the domains of video temporal grounding and reasoning, posing
challenges to the development of effective real-world video understanding
systems. Inspired by how humans use video players to interact with the progress
bar for video comprehension, we introduce VTimeCoT, a simple yet effective
training-free framework, designed for high-performance video grounding and
reasoning. The proposed framework incorporates two novel visual tools of the
progress bar: a plug-and-play progress bar integration tool and a
high-efficiency highlighting tool. In addition, to address the limitations of
conventional text-based chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, we introduce a
visuotemporal CoT process that integrates cross-modality reasoning across both
video and text. Our approach demonstrates significant performance improvements
on both Qwen2VL-7B and GPT4o baselines in tasks of video temporal grounding and
reasoning-based question answering. Finally, we showcase that the proposed
framework achieves a compositional and interpretable reasoning process. Project

Abstract: Compression techniques for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have recently
achieved considerable success in minimizing storage overhead for 3D Gaussians
while preserving high rendering quality. Despite the impressive storage
reduction, the lack of learned priors restricts further advances in the
rate-distortion trade-off for 3DGS compression tasks. To address this, we
introduce a novel 3DGS compression framework that leverages the powerful
representational capacity of learned image priors to recover
compression-induced quality degradation. Built upon initially compressed
Gaussians, our restoration network effectively models the compression artifacts
in the image space between degraded and original Gaussians. To enhance the
rate-distortion performance, we provide coarse rendering residuals into the
restoration network as side information. By leveraging the supervision of
restored images, the compressed Gaussians are refined, resulting in a highly
compact representation with enhanced rendering performance. Our framework is
designed to be compatible with existing Gaussian compression methods, making it
broadly applicable across different baselines. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating superior rate-distortion
performance and outperforming the rendering quality of state-of-the-art 3DGS
compression methods while requiring substantially less storage.

Abstract: Effective monitoring of whale populations is critical for conservation, but
traditional survey methods are expensive and difficult to scale. While prior
work has shown that whales can be identified in very high-resolution (VHR)
satellite imagery, large-scale automated detection remains challenging due to a
lack of annotated imagery, variability in image quality and environmental
conditions, and the cost of building robust machine learning pipelines over
massive remote sensing archives. We present a semi-automated approach for
surfacing possible whale detections in VHR imagery using a statistical anomaly
detection method that flags spatial outliers, i.e. "interesting points". We
pair this detector with a web-based labeling interface designed to enable
experts to quickly annotate the interesting points. We evaluate our system on
three benchmark scenes with known whale annotations and achieve recalls of
90.3% to 96.4%, while reducing the area requiring expert inspection by up to
99.8% -- from over 1,000 sq km to less than 2 sq km in some cases. Our method
does not rely on labeled training data and offers a scalable first step toward
future machine-assisted marine mammal monitoring from space. We have open

Abstract: Camera movement conveys spatial and narrative information essential for
understanding video content. While recent camera movement classification (CMC)
methods perform well on modern datasets, their generalization to historical
footage remains unexplored. This paper presents the first systematic evaluation
of deep video CMC models on archival film material. We summarize representative
methods and datasets, highlighting differences in model design and label
definitions. Five standard video classification models are assessed on the
HISTORIAN dataset, which includes expert-annotated World War II footage. The
best-performing model, Video Swin Transformer, achieves 80.25% accuracy,
showing strong convergence despite limited training data. Our findings
highlight the challenges and potential of adapting existing models to
low-quality video and motivate future work combining diverse input modalities
and temporal architectures.

*Dingzhou Xie,Rushi Lan,Cheng Pang,Enhao Ning,Jiahao Zeng,Wei Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出跨层特征自注意力模块(CFSAM)，通过建模多尺度特征间的局部和全局依赖关系，显著提升目标检测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有注意力方法局限于单层或双层特征优化，忽略了多尺度表示间的丰富层间依赖关系，限制了检测尺度变化大目标的能力

Method: CFSAM包含三个组件：卷积局部特征提取器、基于Transformer的全局建模单元（高效捕获跨层交互）、特征融合机制（恢复和增强原始表示），集成到SSD300框架中

Result: 在PASCAL VOC上达到78.6% mAP（基线75.5%），在COCO上达到52.1% mAP（基线43.1%），优于现有注意力模块，且加速训练收敛而不引入显著计算开销

Conclusion: 显式跨层注意力建模对于推进多尺度目标检测具有重要意义

Abstract: Recent object detection methods have made remarkable progress by leveraging
attention mechanisms to improve feature discriminability. However, most
existing approaches are confined to refining single-layer or fusing dual-layer
features, overlooking the rich inter-layer dependencies across multi-scale
representations. This limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual
information essential for detecting objects with large scale variations. In
this paper, we propose a novel Cross-Layer Feature Self-Attention Module
(CFSAM), which holistically models both local and global dependencies within
multi-scale feature maps. CFSAM consists of three key components: a
convolutional local feature extractor, a Transformer-based global modeling unit
that efficiently captures cross-layer interactions, and a feature fusion
mechanism to restore and enhance the original representations. When integrated
into the SSD300 framework, CFSAM significantly boosts detection performance,
achieving 78.6% mAP on PASCAL VOC (vs. 75.5% baseline) and 52.1% mAP on COCO
(vs. 43.1% baseline), outperforming existing attention modules. Moreover, the
module accelerates convergence during training without introducing substantial
computational overhead. Our work highlights the importance of explicit
cross-layer attention modeling in advancing multi-scale object detection.

TL;DR: 提出了ImageNet-F基准和free-grain学习方法，用于解决现实世界中混合粒度标注的分层图像分类问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分层分类方法假设完整细粒度标注，但现实标注受图像质量、标注者专业知识和任务需求影响，存在不同粒度级别。

Method: 使用CLIP模拟语义模糊性，创建混合粒度标签；提出free-grain学习框架，结合视觉语言模型的伪属性和半监督学习增强语义和视觉引导。

Result: 提出的方法和强基线在混合监督下显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: ImageNet-F基准和free-grain学习方法推动了在现实约束下的分层分类研究。

Abstract: Hierarchical image classification predicts labels across a semantic taxonomy,
but existing methods typically assume complete, fine-grained annotations, an
assumption rarely met in practice. Real-world supervision varies in
granularity, influenced by image quality, annotator expertise, and task
demands; a distant bird may be labeled Bird, while a close-up reveals Bald
eagle. We introduce ImageNet-F, a large-scale benchmark curated from ImageNet
and structured into cognitively inspired basic, subordinate, and fine-grained
levels. Using CLIP as a proxy for semantic ambiguity, we simulate realistic,
mixed-granularity labels reflecting human annotation behavior. We propose
free-grain learning, with heterogeneous supervision across instances. We
develop methods that enhance semantic guidance via pseudo-attributes from
vision-language models and visual guidance via semi-supervised learning. These,
along with strong baselines, substantially improve performance under mixed
supervision. Together, our benchmark and methods advance hierarchical
classification under real-world constraints.

TL;DR: DEXTER是一个无需数据的框架，使用扩散模型和大型语言模型为视觉分类器生成全局文本解释，通过优化文本提示合成激活目标分类器的类条件图像，然后生成描述类特定决策模式和偏见的自然语言报告。


<details>

Motivation: 理解和解释机器学习模型的行为对于构建透明可信的AI系统至关重要，需要在不依赖训练数据或真实标签的情况下提供自然语言解释。

Method: 通过优化文本提示合成类条件图像来强烈激活目标分类器，然后使用这些合成样本生成详细的自然语言报告来描述类特定决策模式和偏见。

Result: 在ImageNet、Waterbirds、CelebA和FairFaces上的实验表明，DEXTER在全局模型解释和类级偏见报告方面优于现有方法，定量和定性评估包括用户研究都显示其产生准确、可解释的输出。

Conclusion: DEXTER框架能够有效揭示视觉分类器的内部机制，在激活最大化、切片发现和去偏见、偏见解释等任务中表现出灵活性，为构建透明AI系统提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Understanding and explaining the behavior of machine learning models is
essential for building transparent and trustworthy AI systems. We introduce
DEXTER, a data-free framework that employs diffusion models and large language
models to generate global, textual explanations of visual classifiers. DEXTER
operates by optimizing text prompts to synthesize class-conditional images that
strongly activate a target classifier. These synthetic samples are then used to
elicit detailed natural language reports that describe class-specific decision
patterns and biases. Unlike prior work, DEXTER enables natural language
explanation about a classifier's decision process without access to training
data or ground-truth labels. We demonstrate DEXTER's flexibility across three
tasks-activation maximization, slice discovery and debiasing, and bias
explanation-each illustrating its ability to uncover the internal mechanisms of
visual classifiers. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations, including a user
study, show that DEXTER produces accurate, interpretable outputs. Experiments
on ImageNet, Waterbirds, CelebA, and FairFaces confirm that DEXTER outperforms
existing approaches in global model explanation and class-level bias reporting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在低光条件下难以提取可靠特征表示，导致纹理恢复差、颜色不一致和伪影问题。

Method: 设计光照量化模块(LQM)显式提取和量化光照相关因素，以及光照感知提示模块(LAPM)将光照先验编码为可学习提示来动态指导特征学习。

Result: 在多个低光数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在各种挑战性光照场景下实现了最先进的性能，提供了优异的定性和定量结果。

Conclusion: LightQANet通过量化自适应特征学习能够实现跨不同光照条件的一致和鲁棒图像质量增强。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve illumination while
preserving high-quality color and texture. However, existing methods often fail
to extract reliable feature representations due to severely degraded
pixel-level information under low-light conditions, resulting in poor texture
restoration, color inconsistency, and artifact. To address these challenges, we
propose LightQANet, a novel framework that introduces quantized and adaptive
feature learning for low-light enhancement, aiming to achieve consistent and
robust image quality across diverse lighting conditions. From the static
modeling perspective, we design a Light Quantization Module (LQM) to explicitly
extract and quantify illumination-related factors from image features. By
enforcing structured light factor learning, LQM enhances the extraction of
light-invariant representations and mitigates feature inconsistency across
varying illumination levels. From the dynamic adaptation perspective, we
introduce a Light-Aware Prompt Module (LAPM), which encodes illumination priors
into learnable prompts to dynamically guide the feature learning process. LAPM
enables the model to flexibly adapt to complex and continuously changing
lighting conditions, further improving image enhancement. Extensive experiments
on multiple low-light datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior qualitative and quantitative
results across various challenging lighting scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于无条件扩散模型的方法来重建火星表面地形，填补卫星高度图中的缺失值，相比传统方法在重建精度和感知相似度方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 火星探测越来越依赖虚拟现实技术，但火星地形高度图存在大量缺失值，传统插值方法难以保持几何一致性，而地球上的条件方法无法应用于火星。

Method: 使用无条件扩散模型，在12000个NASA HiRISE火星高度图增强数据集上训练，采用非均匀缩放策略捕捉多尺度地形特征，最终固定为128x128分辨率。

Result: 在1000个测试样本上与逆距离加权、克里金法和纳维-斯托克斯算法相比，重建精度提高4-15%（RMSE），感知相似度提高29-81%（LPIPS）。

Conclusion: 无条件扩散模型能够有效重建火星表面地形，填补高度图中的缺失值，在准确性和感知质量方面均优于传统方法。

Abstract: Space exploration increasingly relies on Virtual Reality for several tasks,
such as mission planning, multidisciplinary scientific analysis, and astronaut
training. A key factor for the reliability of the simulations is having
accurate 3D representations of planetary terrains. Extraterrestrial heightmaps
derived from satellite imagery often contain missing values due to acquisition
and transmission constraints. Mars is among the most studied planets beyond
Earth, and its extensive terrain datasets make the Martian surface
reconstruction a valuable task, although many areas remain unmapped. Deep
learning algorithms can support void-filling tasks; however, whereas Earth's
comprehensive datasets enables the use of conditional methods, such approaches
cannot be applied to Mars. Current approaches rely on simpler interpolation
techniques which, however, often fail to preserve geometric coherence. In this
work, we propose a method for reconstructing the surface of Mars based on an
unconditional diffusion model. Training was conducted on an augmented dataset
of 12000 Martian heightmaps derived from NASA's HiRISE survey. A
non-homogeneous rescaling strategy captures terrain features across multiple
scales before resizing to a fixed 128x128 model resolution. We compared our
method against established void-filling and inpainting techniques, including
Inverse Distance Weighting, kriging, and Navier-Stokes algorithm, on an
evaluation set of 1000 samples. Results show that our approach consistently
outperforms these methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy (4-15% on RMSE)
and perceptual similarity (29-81% on LPIPS) with the original data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无线电通信在MAV集群中存在频谱拥塞、干扰和高功耗问题，需要寻找更可靠的替代方案。

Result: 实验验证了框架的有效性，实现了准确解码和低功耗，在受限环境中表现出良好性能。

Conclusion: 该视觉通信框架为MAV集群提供了一种节能高效的通信替代方案，特别适用于受限环境。

Abstract: Reliable communication in Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) swarms is challenging in
environments, where conventional radio-based methods suffer from spectrum
congestion, jamming, and high power consumption. Inspired by the waggle dance
of honeybees, which efficiently communicate the location of food sources
without sound or contact, we propose a novel visual communication framework for
MAV swarms using motion-based signaling. In this framework, MAVs convey
information, such as heading and distance, through deliberate flight patterns,
which are passively captured by event cameras and interpreted using a
predefined visual codebook of four motion primitives: vertical (up/down),
horizontal (left/right), left-to-up-to-right, and left-to-down-to-right,
representing control symbols (``start'', ``end'', ``1'', ``0''). To decode
these signals, we design an event frame-based segmentation model and a
lightweight Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for action recognition. An integrated
decoding algorithm then combines segmentation and classification to robustly
interpret MAV motion sequences. Experimental results validate the framework's
effectiveness, which demonstrates accurate decoding and low power consumption,
and highlights its potential as an energy-efficient alternative for MAV
communication in constrained environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoT-PL是一个新的开放词汇目标检测框架，通过引入视觉链式思维推理来改进伪标签生成过程，在拥挤或遮挡场景中显著提升了新类别的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的开放词汇目标检测方法过度依赖直接的图像-文本匹配，忽略了理解语义复杂场景所需的中间推理步骤，导致在拥挤或遮挡场景中鲁棒性不足。

Method: CoT-PL将目标理解分解为三个可解释步骤：区域感知、零样本类别识别和背景定位，并提出了对比背景学习来促进目标与背景特征的解耦。

Result: 在拥挤和遮挡场景中，新类别伪标签质量分别比之前最佳方法提升了103.4%和168.4%；在开放词汇COCO数据集上AP50提升了7.7，在LVIS数据集上mask AP提升了2.9。

Conclusion: CoT-PL通过结构化的视觉链式思维推理和对比背景学习，显著提升了开放词汇目标检测在复杂场景中的性能，达到了新的最先进水平。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) seeks to recognize and localize object
categories beyond those seen during training. Recent approaches typically
leverage vision-language models (VLMs) to generate pseudo-labels using
image-text alignment, allowing detectors to generalize to unseen classes
without explicit supervision. However, these methods depend heavily on direct
image-text matching, neglecting the intermediate reasoning steps essential for
interpreting semantically complex scenes. This results in limited robustness
when confronted with crowded or occluded visual contexts. In this paper, we
introduce CoT-PL, a new framework that employs structured visual
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning into the pseudo-labeling process. CoT-PL
decomposes object understanding into three interpretable steps: (1) region
perception even for unseen objects, (2) category recognition via zero-shot
reasoning, and (3) background grounding to separate semantically complex
objects. Crucially, the third step naturally motivates our contrastive
background learning (CBL) that uses the pre-computed background cues as
negatives to promote feature disentanglement between objects and background. In
this way, CoT reasoning and CBL form an integrated pipeline tailored to robust
pseudo-labeling in crowded or occluded scenes. Notably, in these two settings,
our novel-class pseudo-label quality achieves relative improvements of 103.4%
and 168.4% over the best prior, respectively. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that CoT-PL achieves +7.7 AP50 on open-vocabulary COCO and +2.9
mask AP on LVIS for novel classes, setting a new state of the art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的计算病理学基础模型往往忽略器官特异性关键形态模式，这些模式代表不同的生物学过程，能从根本上影响肿瘤行为、治疗反应和患者预后。

Method: PRISM模型整合了每个独特形态内的连续变异谱，反映恶性转化是通过渐进进化过程而非突然表型转变的原则。模型在424名III期结直肠癌患者的874万张组织学图像上训练。

Result: PRISM在5年总生存期预测上表现优异（AUC=0.70，准确率68.37%，HR=3.34），比现有CRC特定方法高15%，比AI基础模型高约23%准确率。模型具有性别无关的鲁棒性和跨临床病理亚组的稳定性能。

Conclusion: PRISM模型成功捕捉了结直肠癌的形态多样性，提供了优越的预后预测性能，并显示出跨不同患者亚组的稳健性。

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the third most prevalent malignancy globally,
with approximately 154,000 new cases and 54,000 projected deaths anticipated
for 2025. The recent advancement of foundation models in computational
pathology has been largely propelled by task agnostic methodologies that can
overlook organ-specific crucial morphological patterns that represent distinct
biological processes that can fundamentally influence tumor behavior,
therapeutic response, and patient outcomes. The aim of this study is to develop
a novel, interpretable AI model, PRISM (Prognostic Representation of Integrated
Spatial Morphology), that incorporates a continuous variability spectrum within
each distinct morphology to characterize phenotypic diversity and reflecting
the principle that malignant transformation occurs through incremental
evolutionary processes rather than abrupt phenotypic shifts. PRISM is trained
on 8.74 million histological images extracted from surgical resection specimens
of 424 patients with stage III CRC. PRISM achieved superior prognostic
performance for five-year OS (AUC = 0.70 +- 0.04; accuracy = 68.37% +- 4.75%;
HR = 3.34, 95% CI = 2.28-4.90; p < 0.0001), outperforming existing CRC-specific
methods by 15% and AI foundation models by ~23% accuracy. It showed
sex-agnostic robustness (AUC delta = 0.02; accuracy delta = 0.15%) and stable
performance across clinicopathological subgroups, with minimal accuracy
fluctuation (delta = 1.44%) between 5FU/LV and CPT-11/5FU/LV regimens,
replicating the Alliance cohort finding of no survival difference between
treatments.

Motivation: 早期肿瘤检测可以挽救生命，但CT扫描中的小肿瘤检测困难。传统AI训练需要大量人工绘制的肿瘤掩模，成本高昂且耗时。而医学报告中丰富的肿瘤描述信息未被充分利用。

Method: R-Super通过训练AI根据医学报告中的肿瘤描述来分割肿瘤，利用大量现成的医学报告进行模型训练，大幅减少对人工掩模的需求。

Conclusion: 该研究挑战了大规模人工肿瘤掩模创建不可或缺的传统观念，为多种肿瘤类型的早期检测建立了可扩展且易于获取的路径。

Abstract: Early tumor detection save lives. Each year, more than 300 million computed
tomography (CT) scans are performed worldwide, offering a vast opportunity for
effective cancer screening. However, detecting small or early-stage tumors on
these CT scans remains challenging, even for experts. Artificial intelligence
(AI) models can assist by highlighting suspicious regions, but training such
models typically requires extensive tumor masks--detailed, voxel-wise outlines
of tumors manually drawn by radiologists. Drawing these masks is costly,
requiring years of effort and millions of dollars. In contrast, nearly every CT
scan in clinical practice is already accompanied by medical reports describing
the tumor's size, number, appearance, and sometimes, pathology
results--information that is rich, abundant, and often underutilized for AI
training. We introduce R-Super, which trains AI to segment tumors that match
their descriptions in medical reports. This approach scales AI training with
large collections of readily available medical reports, substantially reducing
the need for manually drawn tumor masks. When trained on 101,654 reports, AI
models achieved performance comparable to those trained on 723 masks. Combining
reports and masks further improved sensitivity by +13% and specificity by +8%,
surpassing radiologists in detecting five of the seven tumor types. Notably,
R-Super enabled segmentation of tumors in the spleen, gallbladder, prostate,
bladder, uterus, and esophagus, for which no public masks or AI models
previously existed. This study challenges the long-held belief that
large-scale, labor-intensive tumor mask creation is indispensable, establishing
a scalable and accessible path toward early detection across diverse tumor
types.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹表示学习方法将轨迹视为孤立的时空序列，忽略了影响轨迹形成的外部环境和内部路径选择行为。

Method: PRTraj包含环境感知模块和路径选择编码器，前者从周围POI分布中捕获多粒度环境语义，后者将路段转换建模为决策序列来捕捉路径选择行为。

Result: 在3个真实世界数据集和5个下游任务上的广泛实验验证了PRTraj的有效性和泛化能力，且在少样本场景下仍保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: PRTraj通过结合环境感知和路径选择建模，显著提升了轨迹表示学习的效果，具有良好的数据效率。

Abstract: Trajectory Representation Learning (TRL) aims to encode raw trajectories into
low-dimensional vectors, which can then be leveraged in various downstream
tasks, including travel time estimation, location prediction, and trajectory
similarity analysis. However, existing TRL methods suffer from a key oversight:
treating trajectories as isolated spatio-temporal sequences, without
considering the external environment and internal route choice behavior that
govern their formation. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that
unifies comprehensive environment \textbf{P}erception and explicit
\textbf{R}oute choice modeling for effective \textbf{Traj}ectory representation
learning, dubbed \textbf{PRTraj}. Specifically, PRTraj first introduces an
Environment Perception Module to enhance the road network by capturing
multi-granularity environmental semantics from surrounding POI distributions.
Building on this environment-aware backbone, a Route Choice Encoder then
captures the route choice behavior inherent in each trajectory by modeling its
constituent road segment transitions as a sequence of decisions. These
route-choice-aware representations are finally aggregated to form the global
trajectory embedding. Extensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets across 5
downstream tasks validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PRTraj.
Moreover, PRTraj demonstrates strong data efficiency, maintaining robust
performance under few-shot scenarios. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大容量生成模型无法在智能手机上部署的问题，因为手机内存和计算资源有限。虽然量化方法可以降低精度实现高效计算，但激进量化会损害模型质量。

Method: 提出分数位量化方法，从32位渐进降低到4位精度，在优化过程中利用分数位来维持高质量生成。

Result: 在SD3.5-Medium、Sana、Pixart和FLUX.1-schnell等多种扩散模型上验证，SHORT方法比标准QAT的FiD低4-7%，并成功在三星S25U手机上运行Sana模型。

Conclusion: SHORT方法有效解决了移动设备上部署大模型的挑战，在保持生成质量的同时实现了高效部署。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in image synthesis or text generation, often with a large capacity
model. However, these large models cannot be deployed on smartphones due to the
limited availability of on-board memory and computations. Quantization methods
lower the precision of the model parameters, allowing for efficient
computations, \eg, in \INT{8}. Although aggressive quantization addresses
efficiency and memory constraints, preserving the quality of the model remains
a challenge. To retain quality in previous aggressive quantization, we propose
a new fractional bits quantization (\short) approach. The novelty is a simple
yet effective idea: we progressively reduce the model's precision from 32 to 4
bits per parameter, and exploit the fractional bits during optimization to
maintain high generation quality. We show that the \short{} yields improved
quality on a variety of diffusion models, including SD3.5-Medium, Sana,
\pixart, and FLUX.1-schnell, while achieving $4-7\%$ lower FiD than standard
QAT. Finally, we deploy and run Sana on a Samsung S25U, which runs on the
Qualcomm SM8750-AB Snapdragon 8 Elite Hexagon Tensor Processor (HTP).

that AI performance stopped improving after 1,500 scans. With synthetic data,
we reached the same performance using only 500 real scans. This finding
suggests that synthetic data can steepen data scaling laws, enabling more
efficient model training than real data alone. Motivated by these lessons, we
created AbdomenAtlas 2.0--a dataset of 10,135 CT scans with a total of 15,130
tumor instances per-voxel manually annotated in six organs (pancreas, liver,
kidney, colon, esophagus, and uterus) and 5,893 control scans. Annotated by 23
expert radiologists, it is several orders of magnitude larger than existing
public tumor datasets. While we continue expanding the dataset, the current
version of AbdomenAtlas 2.0 already provides a strong foundation--based on
lessons from the JHH dataset--for training AI to segment tumors in six organs.
It achieves notable improvements over public datasets, with a +7% DSC gain on
in-distribution tests and +16% on out-of-distribution tests.

TL;DR: QDepth-VLA通过增加深度预测任务来增强VLA模型的空间感知能力，使用量化深度token学习深度感知表示，在仿真和真实世界任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型缺乏理解和推理3D结构的能力，无法满足精细操作任务的需求，需要增强空间感知和推理能力。

Method: 设计专用深度专家模块，预测VQ-VAE编码器生成的深度图量化潜在token，使模型学习包含几何线索的深度感知表示。

Result: 在仿真基准测试和真实世界任务中，QDepth-VLA展现出强大的空间推理能力和在操作任务上的竞争性表现。

Conclusion: 通过深度预测任务增强VLA模型能够有效提升空间感知和推理能力，为精细操作任务提供更好的支持。

Abstract: Spatial perception and reasoning are crucial for Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models to accomplish fine-grained manipulation tasks. However, existing
approaches often lack the ability to understand and reason over the essential
3D structures necessary for precise control. To address this limitation, we
propose QDepth-VLA, a general framework that augments VLA models with an
auxiliary depth prediction task. A dedicated depth expert is designed to
predict quantized latent tokens of depth maps obtained from a VQ-VAE encoder,
enabling the model to learn depth-aware representations that capture critical
geometric cues. Experimental results on the simulation benchmarks and
real-world tasks demonstrate that QDepth-VLA yields strong spatial reasoning
and competitive performance on manipulation tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了ImagerySearch方法，一种基于提示的自适应测试时搜索策略，通过动态调整推理搜索空间和奖励函数来改善视频生成模型在想象力场景中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型在现实场景表现良好，但在想象力场景中性能显著下降，这些场景通常包含罕见共现概念和长距离语义关系，超出了训练分布范围。

Method: ImagerySearch方法根据提示中的语义关系动态调整推理搜索空间和奖励函数，并引入了LDT-Bench基准测试来评估长距离语义提示的生成能力。

Result: 实验表明ImagerySearch在LDT-Bench上持续优于强基线视频生成方法和现有测试时缩放方法，在VBench上也取得了有竞争力的改进。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效提升视频生成模型在挑战性想象力场景中的连贯性和视觉合理性，LDT-Bench的发布将促进想象力视频生成的未来研究。

Abstract: Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress, particularly
excelling in realistic scenarios; however, their performance degrades notably
in imaginative scenarios. These prompts often involve rarely co-occurring
concepts with long-distance semantic relationships, falling outside training
distributions. Existing methods typically apply test-time scaling for improving
video quality, but their fixed search spaces and static reward designs limit
adaptability to imaginative scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose
ImagerySearch, a prompt-guided adaptive test-time search strategy that
dynamically adjusts both the inference search space and reward function
according to semantic relationships in the prompt. This enables more coherent
and visually plausible videos in challenging imaginative settings. To evaluate
progress in this direction, we introduce LDT-Bench, the first dedicated
benchmark for long-distance semantic prompts, consisting of 2,839 diverse
concept pairs and an automated protocol for assessing creative generation
capabilities. Extensive experiments show that ImagerySearch consistently
outperforms strong video generation baselines and existing test-time scaling
approaches on LDT-Bench, and achieves competitive improvements on VBench,
demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse prompt types. We will release
LDT-Bench and code to facilitate future research on imaginative video
generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个深度学习框架，不仅能对皮肤病变进行分类，还能量化ABCDE特征评分，模拟病变演化过程，为医生提供可解释的诊断依据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习模型对皮肤病变分析多为黑盒方法，缺乏对ABCDE等临床可解释特征的量化评估，需要建立连接机器学习诊断与临床标准的框架。

Method: 开发深度学习框架，量化ABCD特征评分并模拟E特征的演化过程，在潜在空间中可视化病变从良性痣到恶性黑色素瘤的特征轨迹。

Result: 在HAM10000数据集上实现约89%的分类准确率，黑色素瘤AUC达0.96，不对称性、颜色变化和直径特征预测良好，但边界不规则性建模仍具挑战。

Conclusion: 该框架使医生能将机器学习诊断与临床相关标准联系起来，改善对皮肤癌进展的理解，为未来探索开辟更多可能性。

Abstract: Early detection of melanoma has grown to be essential because it
significantly improves survival rates, but automated analysis of skin lesions
still remains challenging. ABCDE, which stands for Asymmetry, Border
irregularity, Color variation, Diameter, and Evolving, is a well-known
classification method for skin lesions, but most deep learning mechanisms treat
it as a black box, as most of the human interpretable features are not
explained. In this work, we propose a deep learning framework that both
classifies skin lesions into categories and also quantifies scores for each
ABCD feature. It simulates the evolution of these features over time in order
to represent the E aspect, opening more windows for future exploration. The A,
B, C, and D values are quantified particularly within this work. Moreover, this
framework also visualizes ABCD feature trajectories in latent space as skin
lesions evolve from benign nevuses to malignant melanoma. The experiments are
conducted using the HAM10000 dataset that contains around ten thousand images
of skin lesions of varying stages. In summary, the classification worked with
an accuracy of around 89 percent, with melanoma AUC being 0.96, while the
feature evaluation performed well in predicting asymmetry, color variation, and
diameter, though border irregularity remains more difficult to model. Overall,
this work provides a deep learning framework that will allow doctors to link ML
diagnoses to clinically relevant criteria, thus improving our understanding of
skin cancer progression.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合多种视觉模态的方法，使用预训练专家模型和程序化组合，在原始视频上构建全自动数据流水线，并通过PHG-MAE模型有效利用多模态数据，实现了参数效率高的实时语义分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界本质上是多模态的，但传统机器学习模型多为单模态或双模态。为了真正理解世界，需要整合所有独立模态，使用最少的人工监督来结合尽可能多的视觉模态。

Method: 使用预训练专家模型和程序化组合，在原始视频上构建全自动数据流水线，采用专门设计的PHG-MAE模型来利用多模态数据，并将模型高效蒸馏成低参数版本（<1M）。

Result: 蒸馏后的低参数模型（<1M）在性能上可与约300M参数的模型竞争，成功实现了在普通硬件上从手持设备或网络摄像头进行实时语义分割，以及使用DPT模型进行近实时深度估计。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了通过多模态整合和高效蒸馏，可以在保持竞争力的同时大幅减少模型参数，为在资源受限设备上部署实时视觉任务提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The real-world is inherently multi-modal at its core. Our tools observe and
take snapshots of it, in digital form, such as videos or sounds, however much
of it is lost. Similarly for actions and information passing between humans,
languages are used as a written form of communication. Traditionally, Machine
Learning models have been unimodal (i.e. rgb -> semantic or text ->
sentiment_class). Recent trends go towards bi-modality, where images and text
are learned together, however, in order to truly understand the world, we need
to integrate all these independent modalities. In this work we try to combine
as many visual modalities as we can using little to no human supervision. In
order to do this, we use pre-trained experts and procedural combinations
between them on top of raw videos using a fully autonomous data-pipeline, which
we also open-source. We then make use of PHG-MAE, a model specifically designed
to leverage multi-modal data. We show that this model which was efficiently
distilled into a low-parameter (<1M) can have competitive results compared to
models of ~300M parameters. We deploy this model and analyze the use-case of
real-time semantic segmentation from handheld devices or webcams on commodity
hardware. Finally, we deploy other off-the-shelf models using the same
framework, such as DPT for near real-time depth estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务上表现出色，但其在面部识别领域的潜力尚未充分探索，特别是需要与现有面部识别模型在标准基准上进行系统比较。

Method: 在多个面部识别数据集（LFW、CALFW、CPLFW、CFP、AgeDB、RFW）上对最先进的MLLMs进行系统性基准测试。

Result: 实验结果显示，MLLMs能够捕捉丰富的语义线索，但在零样本应用的高精度识别场景中表现不如专用面部识别模型。

Conclusion: 该基准为推进基于MLLM的面部识别提供了基础，为设计具有更高准确性和泛化能力的下一代模型提供了见解。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance
across diverse vision-and-language tasks. However, their potential in face
recognition remains underexplored. In particular, the performance of
open-source MLLMs needs to be evaluated and compared with existing face
recognition models on standard benchmarks with similar protocol. In this work,
we present a systematic benchmark of state-of-the-art MLLMs for face
recognition on several face recognition datasets, including LFW, CALFW, CPLFW,
CFP, AgeDB and RFW. Experimental results reveal that while MLLMs capture rich
semantic cues useful for face-related tasks, they lag behind specialized models
in high-precision recognition scenarios in zero-shot applications. This
benchmark provides a foundation for advancing MLLM-based face recognition,
offering insights for the design of next-generation models with higher accuracy
and generalization. The source code of our benchmark is publicly available in

TL;DR: 提出了Free-Form HOI Generation方法，通过多级扩散模型生成可控、多样且物理合理的手-物体交互，超越了传统固定抓握模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HOI生成研究局限于固定抓握模式，基于物理先验或通用意图指令，无法捕捉日常HOI的多样性。

Method: 构建WildO2数据集，提出TOUCH三阶段框架，使用多级扩散模型结合显式接触建模，并通过接触一致性和物理约束进行细化。

Result: 能够生成可控、多样且物理合理的手部交互，代表日常活动中的各种交互模式。

Conclusion: 该方法成功扩展了HOI从抓握到自由形式交互的范围，为手-物体交互生成提供了更灵活和多样化的解决方案。

Abstract: Hand-object interaction (HOI) is fundamental for humans to express intent.
Existing HOI generation research is predominantly confined to fixed grasping
patterns, where control is tied to physical priors such as force closure or
generic intent instructions, even when expressed through elaborate language.
Such an overly general conditioning imposes a strong inductive bias for stable
grasps, thus failing to capture the diversity of daily HOI. To address these
limitations, we introduce Free-Form HOI Generation, which aims to generate
controllable, diverse, and physically plausible HOI conditioned on fine-grained
intent, extending HOI from grasping to free-form interactions, like pushing,
poking, and rotating. To support this task, we construct WildO2, an in-the-wild
diverse 3D HOI dataset, which includes diverse HOI derived from internet
videos. Specifically, it contains 4.4k unique interactions across 92 intents
and 610 object categories, each with detailed semantic annotations. Building on
this dataset, we propose TOUCH, a three-stage framework centered on a
multi-level diffusion model that facilitates fine-grained semantic control to
generate versatile hand poses beyond grasping priors. This process leverages
explicit contact modeling for conditioning and is subsequently refined with
contact consistency and physical constraints to ensure realism. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate our method's ability to generate controllable, diverse,
and physically plausible hand interactions representative of daily activities.

TL;DR: BADAS是一个基于真实世界行车记录仪碰撞数据训练的碰撞预测模型家族，专门针对自车威胁进行优化，在多个基准测试中实现最先进的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有碰撞预测方法无法区分自车威胁与不涉及自车的随机事故，导致实际部署中产生过多误报。

Method: 使用V-JEPA2骨干网络端到端训练，提供BADAS-Open（1.5k公开视频）和BADAS1.0（40k专有视频）两个变体，重新标注主要基准数据集以识别自车参与情况。

Result: 在DAD、DADA-2000、DoTA和Nexar数据集上，BADAS实现了最先进的AP/AUC性能，优于前向碰撞ADAS基线，并提供更真实的事故时间估计。

Conclusion: BADAS模型有效解决了自车威胁识别问题，发布了BADAS-Open模型权重、代码和重新标注的数据集，推动自车中心碰撞预测研究。

Abstract: Existing collision prediction methods often fail to distinguish between
ego-vehicle threats and random accidents not involving the ego vehicle, leading
to excessive false alerts in real-world deployment. We present BADAS, a family
of collision prediction models trained on Nexar's real-world dashcam collision
dataset -- the first benchmark designed explicitly for ego-centric evaluation.
We re-annotate major benchmarks to identify ego involvement, add consensus
alert-time labels, and synthesize negatives where needed, enabling fair AP/AUC
and temporal evaluation. BADAS uses a V-JEPA2 backbone trained end-to-end and
comes in two variants: BADAS-Open (trained on our 1.5k public videos) and
BADAS1.0 (trained on 40k proprietary videos). Across DAD, DADA-2000, DoTA, and
Nexar, BADAS achieves state-of-the-art AP/AUC and outperforms a
forward-collision ADAS baseline while producing more realistic time-to-accident
estimates. We release our BADAS-Open model weights and code, along with
re-annotations of all evaluation datasets to promote ego-centric collision
prediction research.

Motivation: 虽然视觉自回归模型在生成质量和推理效率方面取得了显著进展，但在VAR范式下实现精确灵活的控制机制仍未被充分探索。

Method: 提出改进的MMDiT块和参考注意力模块，通过丢弃图像→条件的非必要注意力来降低计算成本并稳定控制注入，同时强调参数重用和零初始化线性投影。

Result: 实验表明ScaleWeaver能够提供高质量生成和精确控制，同时在效率上优于基于扩散的方法。

Conclusion: ScaleWeaver是视觉自回归范式中实用有效的可控文本到图像生成解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation with visual autoregressive~(VAR) models has recently
achieved impressive advances in generation fidelity and inference efficiency.
While control mechanisms have been explored for diffusion models, enabling
precise and flexible control within VAR paradigm remains underexplored. To
bridge this critical gap, in this paper, we introduce ScaleWeaver, a novel
framework designed to achieve high-fidelity, controllable generation upon
advanced VAR models through parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The core module in
ScaleWeaver is the improved MMDiT block with the proposed Reference Attention
module, which efficiently and effectively incorporates conditional information.
Different from MM Attention, the proposed Reference Attention module discards
the unnecessary attention from image$\rightarrow$condition, reducing
computational cost while stabilizing control injection. Besides, it
strategically emphasizes parameter reuse, leveraging the capability of the VAR
backbone itself with a few introduced parameters to process control
information, and equipping a zero-initialized linear projection to ensure that
control signals are incorporated effectively without disrupting the generative
capability of the base model. Extensive experiments show that ScaleWeaver
delivers high-quality generation and precise control while attaining superior
efficiency over diffusion-based methods, making ScaleWeaver a practical and
effective solution for controllable text-to-image generation within the visual
autoregressive paradigm. Code and models will be released.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注纯语言任务或5个选项以内的多选题，无法处理细粒度视觉分类中数百到数千个高度相关选项的情况，且在大规模选项设置下扩展LLM选择提取到基于检索的问题存在计算成本高的挑战

Method: nlg2choice两阶段方法：首先向MLLM提出开放式问题，然后使用纯文本约束解码预测最可能的选择；在检索设置中，采用提前停止方法计算约束响应选择该选项的概率以显著提高吞吐量

Conclusion: nlg2choice方法有效解决了MLLM在细粒度视觉分类中处理自由形式响应和大规模选项的评估挑战，在分类和检索任务中均表现出优越性能

Abstract: Despite the renewed interest in zero-shot visual classification due to the
rise of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the problem of evaluating
free-form responses of auto-regressive models remains a persistent challenge.
Most existing works focus on language-only tasks or don't consider Multiple
Choice Questions (MCQs) beyond 5-way options, both of which are critical
capabilities to solve tasks in Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) where
choice counts are in the hundreds to thousands and the choices are highly
related. Furthermore, in this highly multi-way MCQ setting it is not clear how
to extend LLM choice extraction to retrieval-based problems, where computing
probabilities over the choice set is computationally costly. In this work we
investigate nlg2choice, a simple two-stage method which first asks the MLLM an
open-ended question for the task with minimal constraints, then uses text-only
constrained decoding to predict the most likely choice. In retrieval settings,
we compute the probability of the constrained response taking that choice with
an early stopping method to significantly improve throughput. Our results show
improvement over a suite of seven fine-grained visual datasets when evaluating
in terms of classification and retrieval, and show that this performance holds
over the various ways that users of LLMs can implement tasks in natural
language.

Motivation: 现有半监督视频异常检测方法在处理复杂对象交互异常时效果不佳，且缺乏可解释性

Method: 使用MLLM分析不同时刻的对象对，生成活动和交互的文本描述，在测试时与正常视频的文本描述进行比较

Result: 在基准数据集上有效检测复杂交互异常，并在非交互异常数据集上达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能有效检测复杂异常，还提供可解释性，可与传统VAD方法结合提升性能

Abstract: Existing semi-supervised video anomaly detection (VAD) methods often struggle
with detecting complex anomalies involving object interactions and generally
lack explainability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel VAD
framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Unlike previous
MLLM-based approaches that make direct anomaly judgments at the frame level,
our method focuses on extracting and interpreting object activity and
interactions over time. By querying an MLLM with visual inputs of object pairs
at different moments, we generate textual descriptions of the activity and
interactions from nominal videos. These textual descriptions serve as a
high-level representation of the activity and interactions of objects in a
video. They are used to detect anomalies during test time by comparing them to
textual descriptions found in nominal training videos. Our approach inherently
provides explainability and can be combined with many traditional VAD methods
to further enhance their interpretability. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method not only detects complex interaction-based
anomalies effectively but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on
datasets without interaction anomalies.

Method: 利用先进的视觉语言模型生成时空定位实体的合成字幕，扩展LVIS和LV-VIS数据集为LVISCap和LV-VISCap，训练MaskCaptioner模型进行联合检测、分割、跟踪和字幕生成。

Result: 在LVISCap和LV-VISCap上预训练后，MaskCaptioner在VidSTG、VLN和BenSMOT三个现有基准测试中实现了最先进的DVOC结果。

Conclusion: 通过合成字幕数据增强和端到端训练，MaskCaptioner有效解决了密集视频目标字幕任务，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Dense Video Object Captioning (DVOC) is the task of jointly detecting,
tracking, and captioning object trajectories in a video, requiring the ability
to understand spatio-temporal details and describe them in natural language.
Due to the complexity of the task and the high cost associated with manual
annotation, previous approaches resort to disjoint training strategies,
potentially leading to suboptimal performance. To circumvent this issue, we
propose to generate captions about spatio-temporally localized entities
leveraging a state-of-the-art VLM. By extending the LVIS and LV-VIS datasets
with our synthetic captions (LVISCap and LV-VISCap), we train MaskCaptioner, an
end-to-end model capable of jointly detecting, segmenting, tracking and
captioning object trajectories. Moreover, with pretraining on LVISCap and
LV-VISCap, MaskCaptioner achieves state-of-the-art DVOC results on three
existing benchmarks, VidSTG, VLN and BenSMOT. The datasets and code are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常基于单张图像或短视频片段进行条件生成，难以在长视频生成中保持场景一致性和精确相机控制。

Method: 采用双时空条件机制：时间相邻帧用于运动连续性，空间相邻内容用于场景一致性；引入3D场景记忆存储静态几何信息，通过动态SLAM和动态掩码策略分离静态场景和动态元素。

Result: 在场景一致性、相机可控性和生成质量方面显著优于现有方法，能够保持长距离空间连贯性而不牺牲计算效率或运动真实感。

Conclusion: 3DScenePrompt通过结合3D场景记忆和双时空条件，成功解决了长视频生成中的场景一致性和相机控制问题，为可控视频生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present 3DScenePrompt, a framework that generates the next video chunk
from arbitrary-length input while enabling precise camera control and
preserving scene consistency. Unlike methods conditioned on a single image or a
short clip, we employ dual spatio-temporal conditioning that reformulates
context-view referencing across the input video. Our approach conditions on
both temporally adjacent frames for motion continuity and spatially adjacent
content for scene consistency. However, when generating beyond temporal
boundaries, directly using spatially adjacent frames would incorrectly preserve
dynamic elements from the past. We address this by introducing a 3D scene
memory that represents exclusively the static geometry extracted from the
entire input video. To construct this memory, we leverage dynamic SLAM with our
newly introduced dynamic masking strategy that explicitly separates static
scene geometry from moving elements. The static scene representation can then
be projected to any target viewpoint, providing geometrically consistent warped
views that serve as strong 3D spatial prompts while allowing dynamic regions to
evolve naturally from temporal context. This enables our model to maintain
long-range spatial coherence and precise camera control without sacrificing
computational efficiency or motion realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods in scene
consistency, camera controllability, and generation quality. Project page :

Abstract: Whole-body multi-modal human motion generation poses two primary challenges:
creating an effective motion generation mechanism and integrating various
modalities, such as text, speech, and music, into a cohesive framework. Unlike
previous methods that usually employ discrete masked modeling or autoregressive
modeling, we develop a continuous masked autoregressive motion transformer,
where a causal attention is performed considering the sequential nature within
the human motion. Within this transformer, we introduce a gated linear
attention and an RMSNorm module, which drive the transformer to pay attention
to the key actions and suppress the instability caused by either the abnormal
movements or the heterogeneous distributions within multi-modalities. To
further enhance both the motion generation and the multimodal generalization,
we employ the DiT structure to diffuse the conditions from the transformer
towards the targets. To fuse different modalities, AdaLN and cross-attention
are leveraged to inject the text, speech, and music signals. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework outperforms previous methods across all
modalities, including text-to-motion, speech-to-gesture, and music-to-dance.
The code of our method will be made public.

Conclusion: RealDPO通过利用真实世界数据进行偏好学习，有效解决了视频生成中复杂运动合成的关键挑战，为高质量视频生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Video generative models have recently achieved notable advancements in
synthesis quality. However, generating complex motions remains a critical
challenge, as existing models often struggle to produce natural, smooth, and
contextually consistent movements. This gap between generated and real-world
motions limits their practical applicability. To address this issue, we
introduce RealDPO, a novel alignment paradigm that leverages real-world data as
positive samples for preference learning, enabling more accurate motion
synthesis. Unlike traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which offers
limited corrective feedback, RealDPO employs Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) with a tailored loss function to enhance motion realism. By contrasting
real-world videos with erroneous model outputs, RealDPO enables iterative
self-correction, progressively refining motion quality. To support
post-training in complex motion synthesis, we propose RealAction-5K, a curated
dataset of high-quality videos capturing human daily activities with rich and
precise motion details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RealDPO
significantly improves video quality, text alignment, and motion realism
compared to state-of-the-art models and existing preference optimization
techniques.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in textual reasoning, they
struggle with mathematical domains like geometry that intrinsically rely on
visual aids. Existing approaches to Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) are often
limited by rigid external tools or fail to generate the high-fidelity,
strategically-timed diagrams necessary for complex problem-solving. To bridge
this gap, we introduce MathCanvas, a comprehensive framework designed to endow
unified Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with intrinsic VCoT capabilities for
mathematics. Our approach consists of two phases. First, a Visual Manipulation
stage pre-trains the model on a novel 15.2M-pair corpus, comprising 10M
caption-to-diagram pairs (MathCanvas-Imagen) and 5.2M step-by-step editing
trajectories (MathCanvas-Edit), to master diagram generation and editing.
Second, a Strategic Visual-Aided Reasoning stage fine-tunes the model on
MathCanvas-Instruct, a new 219K-example dataset of interleaved visual-textual
reasoning paths, teaching it when and how to leverage visual aids. To
facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce MathCanvas-Bench, a challenging
benchmark with 3K problems that require models to produce interleaved
visual-textual solutions. Our model, BAGEL-Canvas, trained under this
framework, achieves an 86% relative improvement over strong LMM baselines on
MathCanvas-Bench, demonstrating excellent generalization to other public math
benchmarks. Our work provides a complete toolkit-framework, datasets, and
benchmark-to unlock complex, human-like visual-aided reasoning in LMMs. Project

*Shizun Wang,Zhenxiang Jiang,Xingyi Yang,Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C4D是一个从单目视频恢复4D动态场景的框架，通过引入时间对应关系扩展了现有的3D重建方法，能够同时估计动态几何和相机姿态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的点云图3D重建方法（如DUSt3R）在静态场景中表现良好，但直接应用于动态场景会导致不准确的结果，因为运动物体违反了多视角几何约束。

Method: C4D通过预测短期的光流和长期的点跟踪两种对应关系，训练动态感知点跟踪器来分离运动元素和静态背景，并引入动态场景优化目标来恢复每帧的3D几何和相机参数。

Result: 实验表明，C4D实现了完整的4D恢复，在深度估计、相机姿态估计和点跟踪等多个下游任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: C4D框架成功地将2D轨迹提升为平滑的3D轨迹，实现了完全集成的4D重建，为动态场景理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recovering 4D from monocular video, which jointly estimates dynamic geometry
and camera poses, is an inevitably challenging problem. While recent
pointmap-based 3D reconstruction methods (e.g., DUSt3R) have made great
progress in reconstructing static scenes, directly applying them to dynamic
scenes leads to inaccurate results. This discrepancy arises because moving
objects violate multi-view geometric constraints, disrupting the
reconstruction. To address this, we introduce C4D, a framework that leverages
temporal Correspondences to extend existing 3D reconstruction formulation to
4D. Specifically, apart from predicting pointmaps, C4D captures two types of
correspondences: short-term optical flow and long-term point tracking. We train
a dynamic-aware point tracker that provides additional mobility information,
facilitating the estimation of motion masks to separate moving elements from
the static background, thus offering more reliable guidance for dynamic scenes.
Furthermore, we introduce a set of dynamic scene optimization objectives to
recover per-frame 3D geometry and camera parameters. Simultaneously, the
correspondences lift 2D trajectories into smooth 3D trajectories, enabling
fully integrated 4D reconstruction. Experiments show that our framework
achieves complete 4D recovery and demonstrates strong performance across
multiple downstream tasks, including depth estimation, camera pose estimation,
and point tracking. Project Page: https://littlepure2333.github.io/C4D

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在降水临近预报中存在可扩展性问题：潜在空间方法需要单独训练自编码器，增加复杂性；像素空间方法计算密集且缺乏注意力机制，难以建模长距离时空依赖。

Method: 在U-Net扩散模型和时空编码器中集成token-wise attention，动态捕捉多尺度空间交互和时间演化，无需单独潜在模块。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于最先进方法，在复杂降水预报场景中具有更好的局部保真度、泛化性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功解决了扩散模型在降水临近预报中的可扩展性问题，通过原生集成注意力机制实现了高效且准确的预测。

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting, predicting future radar echo sequences from current
observations, is a critical yet challenging task due to the inherently chaotic
and tightly coupled spatio-temporal dynamics of the atmosphere. While recent
advances in diffusion-based models attempt to capture both large-scale motion
and fine-grained stochastic variability, they often suffer from scalability
issues: latent-space approaches require a separately trained autoencoder,
adding complexity and limiting generalization, while pixel-space approaches are
computationally intensive and often omit attention mechanisms, reducing their
ability to model long-range spatio-temporal dependencies. To address these
limitations, we propose a Token-wise Attention integrated into not only the
U-Net diffusion model but also the spatio-temporal encoder that dynamically
captures multi-scale spatial interactions and temporal evolution. Unlike prior
approaches, our method natively integrates attention into the architecture
without incurring the high resource cost typical of pixel-space diffusion,
thereby eliminating the need for separate latent modules. Our extensive
experiments and visual evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate that the
proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, yielding
superior local fidelity, generalization, and robustness in complex
precipitation forecasting scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了ChangingGrounding基准和Mem-ChangingGrounder方法，用于解决动态场景中的3D视觉定位问题，通过利用历史观察和高效探索来减少重新扫描成本。

Motivation: 现实世界中机器人需要在动态场景中定位物体，但现有3D视觉定位方法假设点云是重建且最新的，这需要昂贵的重新扫描，阻碍了实际部署。

Method: 提出Mem-ChangingGrounder方法，结合跨模态检索和轻量级多视图融合：识别查询中的对象类型，检索相关记忆指导行动，高效探索场景，进行多视图扫描，并将融合证据投影到3D边界框。

Result: 在ChangingGrounding基准上评估不同基线，Mem-ChangingGrounder实现了最高的定位精度，同时大幅降低了探索成本。

Conclusion: 该基准和方法推动了面向实际应用的、以记忆为中心的3D视觉定位研究发展。

Abstract: Real-world robots localize objects from natural-language instructions while
scenes around them keep changing. Yet most of the existing 3D visual grounding
(3DVG) method still assumes a reconstructed and up-to-date point cloud, an
assumption that forces costly re-scans and hinders deployment. We argue that
3DVG should be formulated as an active, memory-driven problem, and we introduce
ChangingGrounding, the first benchmark that explicitly measures how well an
agent can exploit past observations, explore only where needed, and still
deliver precise 3D boxes in changing scenes. To set a strong reference point,
we also propose Mem-ChangingGrounder, a zero-shot method for this task that
marries cross-modal retrieval with lightweight multi-view fusion: it identifies
the object type implied by the query, retrieves relevant memories to guide
actions, then explores the target efficiently in the scene, falls back when
previous operations are invalid, performs multi-view scanning of the target,
and projects the fused evidence from multi-view scans to get accurate object
bounding boxes. We evaluate different baselines on ChangingGrounding, and our
Mem-ChangingGrounder achieves the highest localization accuracy while greatly
reducing exploration cost. We hope this benchmark and method catalyze a shift
toward practical, memory-centric 3DVG research for real-world applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了WithAnyone模型，通过构建MultiID-2M数据集、引入对比身份损失来缓解身份一致生成中的复制粘贴问题，平衡身份保真度和生成多样性。


<details>

Motivation: 现有身份一致生成模型依赖重建式训练，导致复制粘贴问题——直接复制参考人脸而非保持身份在姿态、表情、光照等自然变化中的一致性，这削弱了可控性和生成表达能力。

Method: 构建大规模配对数据集MultiID-2M，设计量化复制粘贴伪影的基准，提出包含对比身份损失的新训练范式，开发基于扩散的WithAnyone模型。

Result: WithAnyone显著减少复制粘贴伪影，提高姿态和表情的可控性，保持强感知质量。用户研究验证该方法在实现高身份保真度的同时支持富有表现力的可控生成。

Conclusion: 通过数据集构建、基准设计和对比损失，WithAnyone有效缓解了身份一致生成中的复制粘贴问题，在保持身份相似性的同时实现了更好的可控性和多样性。

Abstract: Identity-consistent generation has become an important focus in text-to-image
research, with recent models achieving notable success in producing images
aligned with a reference identity. Yet, the scarcity of large-scale paired
datasets containing multiple images of the same individual forces most
approaches to adopt reconstruction-based training. This reliance often leads to
a failure mode we term copy-paste, where the model directly replicates the
reference face rather than preserving identity across natural variations in
pose, expression, or lighting. Such over-similarity undermines controllability
and limits the expressive power of generation. To address these limitations, we
(1) construct a large-scale paired dataset MultiID-2M, tailored for
multi-person scenarios, providing diverse references for each identity; (2)
introduce a benchmark that quantifies both copy-paste artifacts and the
trade-off between identity fidelity and variation; and (3) propose a novel
training paradigm with a contrastive identity loss that leverages paired data
to balance fidelity with diversity. These contributions culminate in
WithAnyone, a diffusion-based model that effectively mitigates copy-paste while
preserving high identity similarity. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that WithAnyone significantly reduces copy-paste
artifacts, improves controllability over pose and expression, and maintains
strong perceptual quality. User studies further validate that our method
achieves high identity fidelity while enabling expressive controllable
generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够从近距离交互姿态中直观推断交互动态和上下文信息，这启发了作者利用交互姿态先验来构建通用的交互动画框架。

Method: 使用两个条件扩散模型：姿态动画器利用时间先验从交互姿态生成动态运动序列；姿态生成器利用空间先验从单姿态、文本或两者合成交互姿态。

Result: 在多样化数据集和应用上的实验证明了姿态先验的通用性以及框架的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Ponimator能够将高质量动作捕捉数据中的交互知识迁移到开放世界场景中，支持多种交互动画任务。

Abstract: Close-proximity human-human interactive poses convey rich contextual
information about interaction dynamics. Given such poses, humans can
intuitively infer the context and anticipate possible past and future dynamics,
drawing on strong priors of human behavior. Inspired by this observation, we
propose Ponimator, a simple framework anchored on proximal interactive poses
for versatile interaction animation. Our training data consists of
close-contact two-person poses and their surrounding temporal context from
motion-capture interaction datasets. Leveraging interactive pose priors,
Ponimator employs two conditional diffusion models: (1) a pose animator that
uses the temporal prior to generate dynamic motion sequences from interactive
poses, and (2) a pose generator that applies the spatial prior to synthesize
interactive poses from a single pose, text, or both when interactive poses are
unavailable. Collectively, Ponimator supports diverse tasks, including
image-based interaction animation, reaction animation, and text-to-interaction
synthesis, facilitating the transfer of interaction knowledge from high-quality
mocap data to open-world scenarios. Empirical experiments across diverse
datasets and applications demonstrate the universality of the pose prior and
the effectiveness and robustness of our framework.

TL;DR: Terra是一个原生3D世界模型，通过内在3D潜在空间表示和生成可探索环境，解决了现有方法依赖像素对齐表示而忽视物理世界3D本质的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有世界模型大多依赖像素对齐表示作为世界演化的基础，忽视了物理世界固有的3D特性，这会破坏3D一致性并降低建模效率。

Method: 提出点到高斯变分自编码器(P2G-VAE)将3D输入编码为潜在点表示，然后解码为3D高斯基元来联合建模几何和外观；引入稀疏点流匹配网络(SPFlow)生成潜在点表示，同时去噪点潜在的位置和特征。

Result: 在ScanNet v2室内场景上的实验表明，Terra在重建和生成方面实现了最先进的性能，具有高3D一致性。

Conclusion: Terra通过原生3D表示和架构实现了精确的多视角一致性，支持仅通过单次生成过程从任意视角灵活渲染，并通过点潜在空间中的渐进生成实现了可探索的世界建模。

Abstract: World models have garnered increasing attention for comprehensive modeling of
the real world. However, most existing methods still rely on pixel-aligned
representations as the basis for world evolution, neglecting the inherent 3D
nature of the physical world. This could undermine the 3D consistency and
diminish the modeling efficiency of world models. In this paper, we present
Terra, a native 3D world model that represents and generates explorable
environments in an intrinsic 3D latent space. Specifically, we propose a novel
point-to-Gaussian variational autoencoder (P2G-VAE) that encodes 3D inputs into
a latent point representation, which is subsequently decoded as 3D Gaussian
primitives to jointly model geometry and appearance. We then introduce a sparse
point flow matching network (SPFlow) for generating the latent point
representation, which simultaneously denoises the positions and features of the
point latents. Our Terra enables exact multi-view consistency with native 3D
representation and architecture, and supports flexible rendering from any
viewpoint with only a single generation process. Furthermore, Terra achieves
explorable world modeling through progressive generation in the point latent
space. We conduct extensive experiments on the challenging indoor scenes from
ScanNet v2. Terra achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction
and generation with high 3D consistency.

Motivation: 现有图像编辑模型依赖大规模输入-目标配对数据进行监督微调，但这类自然配对数据难以大规模获取，而使用合成训练对会传播预训练模型的缺陷

Method: 直接优化少步扩散模型，训练时展开模型并利用视觉语言模型评估编辑是否遵循指令并保留未修改内容，提供端到端优化的直接梯度，同时结合分布匹配损失确保视觉保真度

Result: 在标准基准测试中，无需任何配对数据的情况下，在少步设置下与使用大量监督配对数据训练的各种图像编辑扩散模型表现相当，且优于基于强化学习的方法如Flow-GRPO

Conclusion: 该方法成功消除了对配对数据的依赖，通过直接优化和视觉语言模型反馈实现了高效的图像编辑训练

Abstract: Recent image editing models have achieved impressive results while following
natural language editing instructions, but they rely on supervised fine-tuning
with large datasets of input-target pairs. This is a critical bottleneck, as
such naturally occurring pairs are hard to curate at scale. Current workarounds
use synthetic training pairs that leverage the zero-shot capabilities of
existing models. However, this can propagate and magnify the artifacts of the
pretrained model into the final trained model. In this work, we present a new
training paradigm that eliminates the need for paired data entirely. Our
approach directly optimizes a few-step diffusion model by unrolling it during
training and leveraging feedback from vision-language models (VLMs). For each
input and editing instruction, the VLM evaluates if an edit follows the
instruction and preserves unchanged content, providing direct gradients for
end-to-end optimization. To ensure visual fidelity, we incorporate distribution
matching loss (DMD), which constrains generated images to remain within the
image manifold learned by pretrained models. We evaluate our method on standard
benchmarks and include an extensive ablation study. Without any paired data,
our method performs on par with various image editing diffusion models trained
on extensive supervised paired data, under the few-step setting. Given the same
VLM as the reward model, we also outperform RL-based techniques like Flow-GRPO.

Abstract: The edifice of native Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has emerged as a rising
contender to typical modular VLMs, shaped by evolving model architectures and
training paradigms. Yet, two lingering clouds cast shadows over its widespread
exploration and promotion: (-) What fundamental constraints set native VLMs
apart from modular ones, and to what extent can these barriers be overcome? (-)
How to make research in native VLMs more accessible and democratized, thereby
accelerating progress in the field. In this paper, we clarify these challenges
and outline guiding principles for constructing native VLMs. Specifically, one
native VLM primitive should: (i) effectively align pixel and word
representations within a shared semantic space; (ii) seamlessly integrate the
strengths of formerly separate vision and language modules; (iii) inherently
embody various cross-modal properties that support unified vision-language
encoding, aligning, and reasoning. Hence, we launch NEO, a novel family of
native VLMs built from first principles, capable of rivaling top-tier modular
counterparts across diverse real-world scenarios. With only 390M image-text
examples, NEO efficiently develops visual perception from scratch while
mitigating vision-language conflicts inside a dense and monolithic model
crafted from our elaborate primitives. We position NEO as a cornerstone for
scalable and powerful native VLMs, paired with a rich set of reusable
components that foster a cost-effective and extensible ecosystem. Our code and
models are publicly available at: https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/NEO.

Abstract: We present an inference-time diffusion sampling method to perform multi-view
consistent image editing using pre-trained 2D image editing models. These
models can independently produce high-quality edits for each image in a set of
multi-view images of a 3D scene or object, but they do not maintain consistency
across views. Existing approaches typically address this by optimizing over
explicit 3D representations, but they suffer from a lengthy optimization
process and instability under sparse view settings. We propose an implicit 3D
regularization approach by constraining the generated 2D image sequences to
adhere to a pre-trained multi-view image distribution. This is achieved through
coupled diffusion sampling, a simple diffusion sampling technique that
concurrently samples two trajectories from both a multi-view image distribution
and a 2D edited image distribution, using a coupling term to enforce the
multi-view consistency among the generated images. We validate the
effectiveness and generality of this framework on three distinct multi-view
image editing tasks, demonstrating its applicability across various model
architectures and highlighting its potential as a general solution for
multi-view consistent editing.
