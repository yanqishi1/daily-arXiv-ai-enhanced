Although existing methods have advanced the field, their\nreliance on synthetic infrared images generated through style transfer from\nvisible images, which limits their ability to capture the unique\ncharacteristics of the infrared modality. To address this, we propose IRGPT,\nthe first multi-modal large language model for real-world infrared images,\nbuilt upon a large-scale InfraRed-Text Dataset (IR-TD) comprising over 260K\nauthentic image-text pairs. The proposed IR-TD dataset contains real infrared\nimages paired with meticulously handcrafted texts, where the initial drafts\noriginated from two complementary processes: (1) LLM-generated descriptions of\nvisible images, and (2) rule-based descriptions of annotations. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a bi-cross-modal curriculum transfer learning strategy that\nsystematically transfers knowledge from visible to infrared domains by\nconsidering the difficulty scores of both infrared-visible and infrared-text.\nEvaluated on a benchmark of 9 tasks (e.g., recognition, grounding), IRGPT\nachieves state-of-the-art performance even compared with larger-scale models.", "AI": {"tldr": "IRGPT\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7ea2\u5916-\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08IR-TD\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u57289\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5408\u6210\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u771f\u5b9e\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaIR-TD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0826\u4e07\u771f\u5b9e\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u5411\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ece\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u77e5\u8bc6\u5230\u7ea2\u5916\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u57289\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff09\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "IRGPT\u901a\u8fc7\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

As a result, platforms that host models and\ndatasets are widely used. For example, Hugging Face, one of the most popular\nplatforms, hosted 1.8 million models and 450K datasets by June 2025, with no\nsign of slowing down. Since many LLMs are built from base models, pre-trained\nmodels, and external datasets, they can inherit vulnerabilities, biases, or\nmalicious components from earlier models or datasets. Therefore, it is critical\nto understand the origin and development of these components to better detect\npotential risks, improve model fairness, and ensure compliance. Motivated by\nthis, our project aims to study the relationships between models and datasets,\nwhich are core components of the LLM supply chain. First, we design a method to\nsystematically collect LLM supply chain data. Using this data, we build a\ndirected heterogeneous graph to model the relationships between models and\ndatasets, resulting in a structure with 397,376 nodes and 453,469 edges. We\nthen perform various analyses and uncover several findings, such as: (i) the\nLLM supply chain graph is large, sparse, and follows a power-law degree\ndistribution; (ii) it features a densely connected core and a fragmented\nperiphery; (iii) datasets play pivotal roles in training; (iv) strong\ninterdependence exists between models and datasets; and (v) the graph is\ndynamic, with daily updates reflecting the ecosystem's ongoing evolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u70b9\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u7ee7\u627f\u6f0f\u6d1e\u6216\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u5173\u7cfb\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u6536\u96c6LLM\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6709\u5411\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\uff08397,376\u8282\u70b9\u548c453,469\u8fb9\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u79cd\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u56fe\u89c4\u6a21\u5927\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u7b26\u5408\u5e42\u5f8b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8d77\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4e14\u56fe\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3LLM\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u98ce\u9669\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u3002"}}

Recent studies have explored the use of Bidirectional Encoder\nRepresentations from Transformers (BERT) models on transcription data to\nreliably detect meaningful CPS indicators. A notable advancement involved the\nmultimodal BERT variant, AudiBERT, which integrates speech and\nacoustic-prosodic audio features to enhance CPS diagnosis. Although initial\nresults demonstrated multimodal improvements, the statistical significance of\nthese enhancements remained unclear, and there was insufficient guidance on\nleveraging human-AI complementarity for CPS diagnosis tasks. This workshop\npaper extends the previous research by highlighting that the AudiBERT model not\nonly improved the classification of classes that were sparse in the dataset,\nbut it also had statistically significant class-wise improvements over the BERT\nmodel for classifications in the social-cognitive dimension. However, similar\nsignificant class-wise improvements over the BERT model were not observed for\nclassifications in the affective dimension. A correlation analysis highlighted\nthat larger training data was significantly associated with higher recall\nperformance for both the AudiBERT and BERT models.

This surge\npresents a significant challenge in efficiently choosing the most suitable\npre-trained models for downstream tasks. The critical aspect of this challenge\nlies in effectively predicting the model transferability by considering the\nunderlying fine-tuning dynamics. Existing methods often model fine-tuning\ndynamics in feature space with linear transformations, which do not precisely\nalign with the fine-tuning objective and fail to grasp the essential\nnonlinearity from optimization. To this end, we present LEAD, a\nfinetuning-aligned approach based on the network output of logits. LEAD\nproposes a theoretical framework to model the optimization process and derives\nan ordinary differential equation (ODE) to depict the nonlinear evolution\ntoward the final logit state.

Among these domains, mathematical reasoning serves as a representative\nbenchmark as it requires precise multi-step logic and abstract reasoning, which\ncan be generalized to other tasks. While closed-source RLMs such as GPT-o3\ndemonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities, their proprietary nature limits\ntransparency and reproducibility. Although many open-source projects aim to\nclose this gap, most of them lack sufficient openness by omitting critical\nresources such as datasets and detailed training configurations, which hinders\nreproducibility. To contribute toward greater transparency in RLM development,\nwe introduce the MiroMind-M1 series, a set of fully open-source RLMs built on\nthe Qwen-2.5 backbone that match or exceed the performance of existing\nopen-source RLMs. Specifically, our models are trained in two stages: SFT on a\ncarefully curated corpus of 719K math-reasoning problems with verified CoT\ntrajectories, followed by RLVR on 62K challenging and verifiable problems. To\nenhance the robustness and efficiency of the RLVR process, we introduce\nContext-Aware Multi-Stage Policy Optimization, an algorithm that integrates\nlength-progressive training with an adaptive repetition penalty to encourage\ncontext-aware RL training. Our model achieves state-of-the-art or competitive\nperformance and superior token efficiency among Qwen-2.5-based open-source 7B\nand 32B models on the AIME24, AIME25, and MATH benchmarks. To facilitate\nreproducibility, we release the complete stack: models (MiroMind-M1-SFT-7B,\nMiroMind-M1-RL-7B, MiroMind-M1-RL-32B); datasets (MiroMind-M1-SFT-719K,\nMiroMind-M1-RL-62K); and all training and evaluation configurations.

The\nSegment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) and its related variants, which introduce a\nstreaming memory mechanism for real-time video segmentation, present new\nopportunities for prompt-based, generalizable solutions. Nevertheless, adapting\nthese models to medical video scenarios typically requires large-scale datasets\nfor retraining or transfer learning, leading to high computational costs and\nthe risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose\nDD-SAM2, an efficient adaptation framework for SAM2 that incorporates a\nDepthwise-Dilated Adapter (DD-Adapter) to enhance multi-scale feature\nextraction with minimal parameter overhead. This design enables effective\nfine-tuning of SAM2 on medical videos with limited training data. Unlike\nexisting adapter-based methods focused solely on static images, DD-SAM2 fully\nexploits SAM2's streaming memory for medical video object tracking and\nsegmentation. Comprehensive evaluations on TrackRad2025 (tumor segmentation)\nand EchoNet-Dynamic (left ventricle tracking) datasets demonstrate superior\nperformance, achieving Dice scores of 0.93 and 0.97, respectively. To the best\nof our knowledge, this work provides an initial attempt at systematically\nexploring adapter-based SAM2 fine-tuning for medical video segmentation and\ntracking.

GRACE also reduces\nattention computation by up to 48% with long sequences.", "AI": {"tldr": "GRACE\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u884c\u4e3a\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Chain-of-Thought tokenization\u548cJourney-Aware Sparse Attention\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u884c\u4e3a\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "GRACE\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408Chain-of-Thought tokenization\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4ea7\u54c1\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1Journey-Aware Sparse Attention\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5173\u6ce8\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u90e8\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cGRACE\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe106.9%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e48%\u3002", "conclusion": "GRACE\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdbtokenization\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u884c\u4e3a\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

All models achieved satisfying performance, and for each food type, at\nleast one model approached or surpassed 90% DPA, demonstrating strong alignment\nin pixel-wise proportion estimates. Lighter models with reduced parameter\ncounts offered faster inference, achieving real-time throughput on an NVIDIA T4\nGPU. Further analysis showed superior segmentation performance for dry and more\nrigid components (e.g., rice and fries), while more complex, fragmented, or\nviscous dishes, such as stews, showed reduced performance, specifically\npost-consumption.

Meanwhile, conventional GSR\nmodels often lack generalization ability, falling short in recognizing unseen\nand rare situations. In this paper, we exploit transferring knowledge from a\nteacher MLLM to a small GSR model to enhance its generalization and zero-shot\nabilities, thereby introducing the task of Open-vocabulary Grounded Situation\nRecognition (Ov-GSR). To achieve this, we propose Multimodal Interactive Prompt\nDistillation (MIPD), a novel framework that distills enriched multimodal\nknowledge from the foundation model, enabling the student Ov-GSR model to\nrecognize unseen situations and be better aware of rare situations.\nSpecifically, the MIPD framework first leverages the LLM-based Judgmental\nRationales Generator (JRG) to construct positive and negative glimpse and gaze\nrationales enriched with contextual semantic information.

To\nunlock the unprecedented critique capabilities, we propose RefCritic, a\nlong-chain-of-thought critic module based on reinforcement learning with dual\nrule-based rewards: (1) instance-level correctness of solution judgments and\n(2) refinement accuracies of the policy model based on critiques, aiming to\ngenerate high-quality evaluations with actionable feedback that effectively\nguides model refinement. We evaluate RefCritic on Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct and\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B across five benchmarks.

Recently developed foundational models\nfor 3D reconstruction, such as Dense and Unconstrained Stereo 3D Reconstruction\n(DUSt3R), Matching and Stereo 3D Reconstruction (MASt3R), and Visual Geometry\nGrounded Transformer (VGGT), have attracted attention due to their ability to\nhandle very sparse image overlaps. Evaluating DUSt3R/MASt3R/VGGT on typical\naerial images matters, as these models may handle extremely low image overlaps,\nstereo occlusions, and textureless regions. For redundant collections, they can\naccelerate 3D reconstruction by using extremely sparsified image sets. Despite\ntests on various computer vision benchmarks, their potential on photogrammetric\naerial blocks remains unexplored.

VGGT also demonstrates higher\ncomputational efficiency, scalability, and more reliable camera pose\nestimation. However, all exhibit limitations with high-resolution images and\nlarge sets, as pose reliability declines with more images and geometric\ncomplexity.

All models demonstrate high\nprecision but consistently suffer from poor recall by omitting key information.\nWe found that customised prompts were the most effective, boosting recall by up\nto 15\\%. Based on this analysis, we propose a three-tiered set of guidelines\nfor using LLMs in data extraction, matching data types to appropriate levels of\nautomation based on task complexity and risk. Our study offers practical advice\nfor automating data extraction in real-world meta-analyses, balancing LLM\nefficiency with expert oversight through targeted, task-specific automation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e09\u79cdLLM\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b9a\u5236\u63d0\u793a\u6700\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u6307\u5357\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4eceRCTs\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u63d0\u53d6\u6570\u636e\u7528\u4e8e\u835f\u8403\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e09\u79cdLLM\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u56db\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u63d0\u53d6\u7edf\u8ba1\u7ed3\u679c\u3001\u504f\u501a\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4f46\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u5b9a\u5236\u63d0\u793a\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u53ec\u56de\u738715%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u76d1\u7763\u3002"}}

Although downstream tasks of\ninterest typically do not provide systems with explicit options among which to\nchoose, this approach is nevertheless widely used because it makes it makes\nautomatic grading straightforward and has tended to produce challenging\nbenchmarks that correlate sufficiently well with downstream performance. This\npaper investigates the extent to which this trend continues to hold for\nstate-of-the-art reasoning models, describing a systematic evaluation of $15$\ndifferent question-answering benchmarks (e.g., MMLU, HLE) and $25$ different\nLLMs (including small models such as Qwen 7B and relatively large models such\nas Llama 70B). For each model-benchmark pair, we considered $5$ ways of\npresenting the model with questions, including variations on whether multiple\nchoices were offered to the model at all; whether \"none of the above\" sometimes\nreplaced the right answer; and whether the model was permitted to perform\nchain-of-thought reasoning before and/or after the choices were presented.

Project page: https://d223302.github.io/STITCH/", "summary": "Spoken Language Models (SLMs) are designed to take speech inputs and produce\nspoken responses. However, current SLMs lack the ability to perform an\ninternal, unspoken thinking process before responding. In contrast, humans\ntypically engage in complex mental reasoning internally, enabling them to\ncommunicate ideas clearly and concisely. Thus, integrating an unspoken thought\nprocess into SLMs is highly desirable. While naively generating a complete\nchain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before starting to talk can enable thinking\nfor SLMs, this induces additional latency for the speech response, as the CoT\nreasoning can be arbitrarily long. To solve this issue, we propose Stitch, a\nnovel generation method that alternates between the generation of unspoken\nreasoning chunks and spoken response chunks. Since the audio duration of a\nchunk of spoken response is much longer than the time to generate the tokens in\na chunk of spoken response, we use the remaining free time to generate the\nunspoken reasoning tokens. When a chunk of audio is played to the user, the\nmodel continues to generate the next unspoken reasoning chunk, achieving\nsimultaneous thinking and talking. Remarkably, Stitch matches the latency of\nbaselines that cannot generate unspoken CoT by design while outperforming those\nbaselines by 15% on math reasoning datasets; Stitch also performs equally well\non non-reasoning datasets as those baseline models.

We present an approach for pose estimation in cryo-EM that\nleverages multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) techniques in a robust manner to\nestimate the 3D rotation matrix of each particle from pairs of dihedral angles.\nWe express the rotation matrix in the form of an axis of rotation and a unit\nvector in the plane perpendicular to the axis. The technique leverages the\nconcept of common lines in 3D reconstruction from projections. However, common\nline estimation is ridden with large errors due to the very low SNR of cryo-EM\nprojection images. To address this challenge, we introduce two complementary\ncomponents: (i) a robust joint optimization framework for pose estimation based\non an $\\ell_1$-norm objective or a similar robust norm, which simultaneously\nestimates rotation axes and in-plane vectors while exactly enforcing unit norm\nand orthogonality constraints via projected coordinate descent; and (ii) an\niterative shift correction algorithm that estimates consistent in-plane\ntranslations through a global least-squares formulation. While prior approaches\nhave leveraged such embeddings and common-line geometry for orientation\nrecovery, existing formulations typically rely on $\\ell_2$-based objectives\nthat are sensitive to noise, and enforce geometric constraints only\napproximately.

However, adapting these large-scale models to\ndownstream tasks while preserving their generalization capabilities remains\nchallenging. Although prompt learning methods have shown promise, they suffer\nfrom two fundamental bottlenecks that limit generalization: (a) modality\nisolation, and (b) hierarchical semantic decay. To address these limitations,\nwe propose HiCroPL, a Hierarchical Cross-modal Prompt Learning framework that\nestablishes bidirectional knowledge flow between text and vision modalities,\nenabling them to refine their semantics mutually. HiCroPL routes knowledge\nflows by leveraging the complementary strengths of text and vision. In early\nlayers, text prompts inject relatively clear semantics into visual prompts\nthrough a hierarchical knowledge mapper, enhancing the representation of\nlow-level visual semantics. In later layers, visual prompts encoding specific\ntask-relevant objects flow back to refine text prompts, enabling deeper\nalignment. Crucially, our hierarchical knowledge mapper allows representations\nat multi-scales to be fused, ensuring that deeper representations retain\ntransferable shallow semantics thereby enhancing generalization.

EBA-AI leverages CLIP embeddings to\ndetect and mitigate dataset bias, ensuring balanced representation across\nvaried underwater environments. It also integrates adaptive processing to\noptimize energy efficiency, significantly reducing GPU usage while maintaining\ncompetitive enhancement quality. Experiments on LSUI400, Oceanex, and UIEB100\nshow that while PSNR drops by a controlled 1.0 dB, computational savings enable\nreal-time feasibility for large-scale marine monitoring. Additionally,\nuncertainty estimation and explainability techniques enhance trust in AI-driven\nenvironmental decisions.

Our experiments show that this unified training strategy not only\nsimplifies deployment but also significantly boosts generalization on\nfull-resolution data.

Building\nupon a video diffusion model, StableAnimator++ contains carefully designed\nmodules for both training and inference, striving for identity consistency. In\nparticular, StableAnimator++ first uses learnable layers to predict the\nsimilarity transformation matrices between the reference image and the driven\nposes via injecting guidance from Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). These\nmatrices align the driven poses with the reference image, mitigating\nmisalignment to a great extent. StableAnimator++ then computes image and face\nembeddings using off-the-shelf encoders, refining the face embeddings via a\nglobal content-aware Face Encoder. To further maintain ID, we introduce a\ndistribution-aware ID Adapter that counteracts interference caused by temporal\nlayers while preserving ID via distribution alignment.

We\nincorporate various typical optical character recognition (OCR) tasks into our\nevaluation and broaden the concept of text-based generation tasks into OCR\ngenerative tasks. We select 33 representative tasks and categorize them into\nfive categories: document, handwritten text, scene text, artistic text, and\ncomplex \\& layout-rich text. For comprehensive evaluation, we examine six\nmodels across both closed-source and open-source domains, using tailored,\nhigh-quality image inputs and prompts. Through this evaluation, we draw crucial\nobservations and identify the weaknesses of current generative models for OCR\ntasks. We argue that photorealistic text image generation and editing should be\ninternalized as foundational skills into general-domain generative models,\nrather than being delegated to specialized solutions, and we hope this\nempirical analysis can provide valuable insights for the community to achieve\nthis goal. This evaluation is online and will be continuously updated at our\nGitHub repository.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86OCR\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u6587\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u7535\u5b50\u793e\u4f1a\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6311\u6218\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u638c\u63e1\u6587\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u9009\u53d6\u4e8633\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5206\u4e3a\u4e94\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u516d\u79cd\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728OCR\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5f31\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u547c\u5401\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u5185\u5316\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

In\nparticular, endoscopists have to repeatedly flush to clear blood, allowing only\nmilliseconds to identify bleeding sources, an inefficient process that prolongs\noperations and elevates patient risks. However, current Artificial Intelligence\n(AI) methods primarily focus on bleeding region segmentation, overlooking the\ncritical need for accurate bleeding source detection and temporal tracking in\nthe challenging ESD environment, which is marked by frequent visual\nobstructions and dynamic scene changes. This gap is widened by the lack of\nspecialized datasets, hindering the development of robust AI-assisted guidance\nsystems.

While current detection methods show promise, their underlying\nmechanisms remain poorly understood, and the large sizes of their models make\nthem challenging to deploy in resource-limited environments. This study\ninvestigates the application of the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) to deepfake\ndetection, aiming to identify the key features crucial for recognizing\ndeepfakes. We examine how neural networks can be efficiently pruned while\nmaintaining high detection accuracy. Through extensive experiments with\nMesoNet, CNN-5, and ResNet-18 architectures on the OpenForensic and\nFaceForensics++ datasets, we find that deepfake detection networks contain\nwinning tickets, i.e., subnetworks, that preserve performance even at\nsubstantial sparsity levels. Our results indicate that MesoNet retains 56.2%\naccuracy at 80% sparsity on the OpenForensic dataset, with only 3,000\nparameters, which is about 90% of its baseline accuracy (62.6%).

Recent work has revealed that the prior knowledge in MLLMs significantly\nsuppresses visual information in deep layers, causing hallucinatory outputs.\nHowever, how these priors suppress visual information at the intermediate layer\nstage in MLLMs remains unclear.

By contrasting the output\ndistributions of the selected layer derived from the original input and\npure-text input, EVA extracts visual factual knowledge and proportionally\nincorporates it into the final layer to correct the output logits.

Although FIQA has been extensively studied and achieved\nsignificant progress, the computational complexity of FIQA algorithms remains a\nkey concern for ensuring scalability and practical deployment in real-world\nsystems. In this paper, we aim to develop a computationally efficient FIQA\nmethod that can be easily deployed in real-world applications. Specifically,\nour method consists of two stages: training a powerful teacher model and\ndistilling a lightweight student model from it. To build a strong teacher\nmodel, we adopt a self-training strategy to improve its capacity. We first\ntrain the teacher model using labeled face images, then use it to generate\npseudo-labels for a set of unlabeled images. These pseudo-labeled samples are\nused in two ways: (1) to distill knowledge into the student model, and (2) to\ncombine with the original labeled images to further enhance the teacher model\nthrough self-training. The enhanced teacher model is used to further\npseudo-label another set of unlabeled images for distilling the student models.\nThe student model is trained using a combination of labeled images,\npseudo-labeled images from the original teacher model, and pseudo-labeled\nimages from the enhanced teacher model. Experimental results demonstrate that\nour student model achieves comparable performance to the teacher model with an\nextremely low computational overhead.

Our method\ndecomposes long video generation into three core tasks: (1) inner-clip semantic\ncontrol, (2) long-term consistency control, and (3) inter-clip smooth\ntransition. First, we train To2V (Token-to-Video), a short video diffusion\nmodel guided by text and video tokens, with a Video Tokenizer that condenses\nshort clips into semantically rich tokens. Second, we introduce T2To\n(Text-to-Token), a video token diffusion transformer that generates all tokens\nat once, ensuring global consistency across clips. Finally, during inference,\nan adaptive FIFO-Diffusion strategy seamlessly connects adjacent clips,\nreducing boundary artifacts and enhancing smooth transitions.

Among these methods, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)\nis a notable approach based on the assumption that the adaptation inherently\noccurs in a low-dimensional subspace. While it has shown good performance, its\nimplementation requires a fixed and unalterable rank, which might be\nchallenging to select given the unique complexities and requirements of each\nmedical imaging downstream task.

Semi-supervised\nsemantic segmentation (SSSS) has emerged as a solution to alleviate the\nlabeling burden by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data through\nself-training techniques. Meanwhile, the advent of foundational segmentation\nmodels pre-trained on massive data, has shown the potential to generalize\nacross domains effectively. This work explores whether a foundational\nsegmentation model can address label scarcity in the pixel-level vision task as\nan annotator for unlabeled images. Specifically, we investigate the efficacy of\nusing SEEM, a Segment Anything Model (SAM) variant fine-tuned for textual\ninput, to generate predictive masks for unlabeled data. To address the\nshortcomings of using SEEM-generated masks as supervision, we propose\nConformalSAM, a novel SSSS framework which first calibrates the foundation\nmodel using the target domain's labeled data and then filters out unreliable\npixel labels of unlabeled data so that only high-confidence labels are used as\nsupervision. By leveraging conformal prediction (CP) to adapt foundation models\nto target data through uncertainty calibration, ConformalSAM exploits the\nstrong capability of the foundational segmentation model reliably which\nbenefits the early-stage learning, while a subsequent self-reliance training\nstrategy mitigates overfitting to SEEM-generated masks in the later training\nstage.

Despite notable\nadvances with recent efforts, current techniques still lag behind human\ncapabilities in handling drastic visual variations, occlusions, and complex\nscene changes. This limitation arises from their reliance on appearance\nmatching, neglecting the human-like conceptual understanding of objects that\nenables robust identification across temporal dynamics. Motivated by this gap,\nwe propose Segment Concept (SeC), a concept-driven segmentation framework that\nshifts from conventional feature matching to the progressive construction and\nutilization of high-level, object-centric representations. SeC employs Large\nVision-Language Models (LVLMs) to integrate visual cues across diverse frames,\nconstructing robust conceptual priors. During inference, SeC forms a\ncomprehensive semantic representation of the target based on processed frames,\nrealizing robust segmentation of follow-up frames. Furthermore, SeC adaptively\nbalances LVLM-based semantic reasoning with enhanced feature matching,\ndynamically adjusting computational efforts based on scene complexity. To\nrigorously assess VOS methods in scenarios demanding high-level conceptual\nreasoning and robust semantic understanding, we introduce the Semantic Complex\nScenarios Video Object Segmentation benchmark (SeCVOS). SeCVOS comprises 160\nmanually annotated multi-scenario videos designed to challenge models with\nsubstantial appearance variations and dynamic scene transformations.
