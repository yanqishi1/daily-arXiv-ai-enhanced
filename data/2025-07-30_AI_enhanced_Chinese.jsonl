However, the development of robust sensor-based classification models\nfor physiotherapeutic exercises and gait analysis requires large, diverse\ndatasets, which are costly and time-consuming to collect. Here, we present a\nmultimodal dataset of physiotherapeutic exercises - including correct and\nclinically relevant variants - and gait-related exercises - including both\nnormal and impaired gait patterns - recorded from 19 participants using\nsynchronized IMUs and marker-based motion capture (MoCap). The dataset includes\nraw data from nine IMUs and thirty-five optical markers capturing full-body\nkinematics. Each IMU is additionally equipped with four optical markers,\nenabling precise comparison between IMU-derived orientation estimates and\nreference values from the MoCap system. To support further analysis, we also\nprovide processed IMU orientations aligned with common segment coordinate\nsystems, subject-specific OpenSim models, inverse kinematics results, and tools\nfor visualizing IMU orientations in the musculoskeletal context. Detailed\nannotations of movement execution quality and time-stamped segmentations\nsupport diverse analysis goals. This dataset supports the development and\nbenchmarking of machine learning models for tasks such as automatic exercise\nevaluation, gait analysis, temporal activity segmentation, and biomechanical\nparameter estimation.

While enabling users to edit charts based on\nhigh-level intentions is of great practical value, existing methods primarily\nrely on natural language instructions, which are often too ambiguous to support\nfine-grained editing. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for\nmultimodal chart editing, where user intent is expressed through a combination\nof natural language and visual indicators that explicitly highlight the\nelements to be modified. To support this paradigm, we present\nChart$\\text{M}^3$, a new benchmark for Multimodal chart editing with\nMulti-level complexity and Multi-perspective evaluation.

Drawing\ninspiration from Vygotsky's sociocultural theory, this study explores the\npotential of socially mediated learning paradigms to address these limitations.\n  We introduce a dynamic environment, termed the 'AI Social Gym', where an AI\nlearner agent engages in dyadic pedagogical dialogues with knowledgeable AI\nteacher agents. These interactions emphasize external, structured dialogue as a\ncore mechanism for knowledge acquisition, contrasting with methods that depend\nsolely on internal inference or pattern recognition.\n  Our investigation focuses on how different pedagogical strategies impact the\nAI learning process in the context of ontology acquisition. Empirical results\nindicate that such dialogic approaches-particularly those involving\nmixed-direction interactions combining top-down explanations with\nlearner-initiated questioning-significantly enhance the LLM's ability to\nacquire and apply new knowledge, outperforming both unidirectional\ninstructional methods and direct access to structured knowledge, formats\ntypically present in training datasets.\n  These findings suggest that integrating pedagogical and psychological\ninsights into AI and robot training can substantially improve post-training\nknowledge acquisition and response quality.

We analyzed over 260 edits per dataset, and identified two editing\npatterns: one where students refined introductory units repeatedly before\nprogressing, and another where they quickly shifted to extensive edits in body\nunits (e.g., topic and supporting sentences). MLR analyses revealed that the\nnumber of AI-generated words positively predicted all score dimensions, while\nmost editing variables showed minimal impact.

While these models have shown\nencouraging results in terms of accuracy and discriminative performance, their\nfairness and robustness in the different clinical tasks remain largely\nunderexplored. In this study, we extensively evaluate six widely used\nCLIP-based models on chest X-ray classification using three publicly available\ndatasets: MIMIC-CXR, NIH-CXR14, and NEATX. We assess the models fairness across\nsix conditions and patient subgroups based on age, sex, and race. Additionally,\nwe assess the robustness to shortcut learning by evaluating performance on\npneumothorax cases with and without chest drains. Our results indicate\nperformance gaps between patients of different ages, but more equitable results\nfor the other attributes. Moreover, all models exhibit lower performance on\nimages without chest drains, suggesting reliance on spurious correlations. We\nfurther complement the performance analysis with a study of the embeddings\ngenerated by the models. While the sensitive attributes could be classified\nfrom the embeddings, we do not see such patterns using PCA, showing the\nlimitations of these visualisation techniques when assessing models.

While existing evaluation\nmethods assess performance after such interventions, there remains no general\napproach for detecting unintended side effects, such as unlearning biology\ncontent degrading performance on chemistry tasks, particularly when these\neffects are unpredictable or emergent. To address this issue, we introduce\nMNEME, Model diffiNg for Evaluating Mechanistic Effects, a lightweight\nframework for identifying these side effects using sparse model diffing. MNEME\ncompares base and fine-tuned models on task-agnostic data (for example, The\nPile, LMSYS-Chat-1M) without access to fine-tuning data to isolate behavioral\nshifts. Applied to five LLMs across three scenarios: WMDP knowledge unlearning,\nemergent misalignment, and benign fine-tuning, MNEME achieves up to 95 percent\naccuracy in predicting side effects, aligning with known benchmarks and\nrequiring no custom heuristics. Furthermore, we show that retraining on\nhigh-activation samples can partially reverse these effects.

A remaining significant challenge\nin this task is structural fragmentation, which can adversely impact downstream\napplications. Existing methods primarily focus on designing various loss\nfunctions to constrain global topological structures. However, they often\noverlook local discontinuity regions, leading to suboptimal segmentation\nresults. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Global-to-Local\nConnectivity Preservation (GLCP) framework that can simultaneously perceive\nglobal and local structural characteristics of tubular networks. Specifically,\nwe propose an Interactive Multi-head Segmentation (IMS) module to jointly learn\nglobal segmentation, skeleton maps, and local discontinuity maps, respectively.\nThis enables our model to explicitly target local discontinuity regions while\nmaintaining global topological integrity. In addition, we design a lightweight\nDual-Attention-based Refinement (DAR) module to further improve segmentation\nquality by refining the resulting segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on\nboth 2D and 3D datasets demonstrate that our GLCP achieves superior accuracy\nand continuity in tubular structure segmentation compared to several\nstate-of-the-art approaches.

Recent studies have shown the\npotential of using deep learning models that incorporate information from prior\nsubject-specific MRI scans to improve reconstruction quality of present scans.\nIntegrating this prior information requires registration of the previous scan\nto the current image reconstruction, which can be time-consuming. We propose a\nnovel deep-learning-based MRI reconstruction framework which consists of an\ninitial reconstruction network, a deep registration model, and a\ntransformer-based enhancement network. We validated our method on a\nlongitudinal dataset of T1-weighted MRI scans with 2,808 images from 18\nsubjects at four acceleration factors (R5, R10, R15, R20). Quantitative metrics\nconfirmed our approach's superiority over existing methods (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon\nsigned-rank test).

However, existing methods often construct BEV\nrepresentations by collapsing extracted object features, neglecting intrinsic\nenvironmental contexts, such as roads and pavements. This hinders detectors\nfrom comprehensively perceiving the characteristics of the physical world. To\nalleviate this, we introduce a multi-task learning framework, Collaborative\nPerceiver (CoP), that leverages spatial occupancy as auxiliary information to\nmine consistent structural and conceptual similarities shared between 3D object\ndetection and occupancy prediction tasks, bridging gaps in spatial\nrepresentations and feature refinement. To this end, we first propose a\npipeline to generate dense occupancy ground truths incorporating local density\ninformation (LDO) for reconstructing detailed environmental information. Next,\nwe employ a voxel-height-guided sampling (VHS) strategy to distill fine-grained\nlocal features according to distinct object properties. Furthermore, we develop\na global-local collaborative feature fusion (CFF) module that seamlessly\nintegrates complementary knowledge between both tasks, thus composing more\nrobust BEV representations.

Specifically, ReGATE adopts a teacher-student\nframework in which the MLLM being trained serves as the student, and a frozen\nreference large language model (LLM) acts as the teacher. The teacher computes\nper-token reference losses, which are combined with an exponential moving\naverage (EMA) of the student's own difficulty scores. This adaptive\ndifficulty-based scoring enables the selective processing of crucial tokens\nwhile bypassing less informative ones in the forward pass, significantly\nreducing computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ReGATE, when\napplied to VideoLLaMA2, matches the peak accuracy of standard training on\nMVBench up to 2$\\times$ faster, using only 35% of the tokens. With additional\ntraining, it even surpasses the baseline on several multimodal benchmarks, all\nwhile reducing the total token count by over 41%. Code and models will be\nreleased soon.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReGATE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4ee4\u724c\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u6846\u67b6\u52a0\u901f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u4ee4\u724c\u51cf\u5c11\u6216\u5408\u5e76\uff0c\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53c2\u8003\u635f\u5931\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u96be\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5904\u7406\u5173\u952e\u4ee4\u724c\u3002", "result": "\u5728VideoLLaMA2\u4e0a\uff0cReGATE\u8fbe\u5230\u6807\u51c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5cf0\u503c\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53472\u500d\uff0c\u4ee4\u724c\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u4ec535%\u3002", "conclusion": "ReGATE\u4e0d\u4ec5\u52a0\u901f\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4ee4\u724c\u603b\u6570\u8d85\u8fc741%\u3002"}}

In\ngeneral, current approaches, which rely on intra-image pixel-wise consistency\ntraining via pseudo-labeling, overlook the consistency at more comprehensive\nsemantic levels (e.g., object region) and suffer from severe discrepancy of\nextracted features resulting from an imbalanced number of labeled and unlabeled\ndata. To overcome these limitations, we present a new \\underline{Du}al\n\\underline{C}ross-\\underline{i}mage \\underline{S}emantic\n\\underline{C}onsistency (DuCiSC) learning framework, for semi-supervised\nmedical image segmentation. Concretely, beyond enforcing pixel-wise semantic\nconsistency, DuCiSC proposes dual paradigms to encourage region-level semantic\nconsistency across: 1) labeled and unlabeled images; and 2) labeled and fused\nimages, by explicitly aligning their prototypes. Relying on the dual paradigms,\nDuCiSC can effectively establish consistent cross-image semantics via prototype\nrepresentations, thereby addressing the feature discrepancy issue.

Existing methods\ntypically utilize all modalities (i.e., voxels, point clouds, multi-view\nimages) and train specific backbones before fusion. However, they still\nstruggle to produce generalized representations due to insufficient 3D training\ndata. Being contrastively pre-trained on web-scale image-text pairs, CLIP\ninherently produces generalized representations for a wide range of downstream\ntasks. Building upon it, we present a simple yet effective framework named\nDescribe, Adapt and Combine (DAC) by taking only multi-view images for open-set\n3DOR. DAC innovatively synergizes a CLIP model with a multi-modal large\nlanguage model (MLLM) to learn generalized 3D representations, where the MLLM\nis used for dual purposes. First, it describes the seen category information to\nalign with CLIP's training objective for adaptation during training. Second, it\nprovides external hints about unknown objects complementary to visual cues\nduring inference. To improve the synergy, we introduce an Additive-Bias\nLow-Rank adaptation (AB-LoRA), which alleviates overfitting and further\nenhances the generalization to unseen categories.

This study investigates the extent to which\nLLMs capture cross-cultural differences and similarities in moral perspectives.\nSpecifically, we examine whether LLM outputs align with patterns observed in\ninternational survey data on moral attitudes. To this end, we employ three\ncomplementary methods: (1) comparing variances in moral scores produced by\nmodels versus those reported in surveys, (2) conducting cluster alignment\nanalyses to assess correspondence between country groupings derived from LLM\noutputs and survey data, and (3) directly probing models with comparative\nprompts using systematically chosen token pairs. Our results reveal that\ncurrent LLMs often fail to reproduce the full spectrum of cross-cultural moral\nvariation, tending to compress differences and exhibit low alignment with\nempirical survey patterns.

However, most existing works focus on generating\nimages of finished foods based on the given recipes, and face two challenges to\nvisualize the cooking process. First, the appearance of ingredients changes\nvariously across cooking steps, it is difficult to generate the correct\nappearances of foods that match the textual description, leading to semantic\ninconsistency. Second, the current step might depend on the operations of\nprevious step, it is crucial to maintain the contextual coherence of images in\nsequential order. In this work, we present a cooking process visualization\nmodel, called Chain-of-Cooking. Specifically, to generate correct appearances\nof ingredients, we present a Dynamic Patch Selection Module to retrieve\npreviously generated image patches as references, which are most related to\ncurrent textual contents. Furthermore, to enhance the coherence and keep the\nrational order of generated images, we propose a Semantic Evolution Module and\na Bidirectional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Guidance. To better utilize the\nsemantics of previous texts, the Semantic Evolution Module establishes the\nsemantical association between latent prompts and current cooking step, and\nmerges it with the latent features. Then the CoT Guidance updates the merged\nfeatures to guide the current cooking step remain coherent with the previous\nstep.

A promising\nstrategy is to augment the training data with online synthesized fake images\ncontaining broadly generalizable artifacts. However, in the context of deepfake\ndetection, it is surprising that jointly training on both original and online\nsynthesized forgeries may result in degraded performance. This contradicts the\ncommon belief that incorporating more source-domain data should enhance\ndetection accuracy. Through empirical analysis, we trace this degradation to\ngradient conflicts during backpropagation which force a trade-off between\nsource domain accuracy and target domain generalization. To overcome this\nissue, we propose a Conflict-Suppressed Deepfake Detection (CS-DFD) framework\nthat explicitly mitigates the gradient conflict via two synergistic modules.\nFirst, an Update Vector Search (UVS) module searches for an alternative update\nvector near the initial gradient vector to reconcile the disparities of the\noriginal and online synthesized forgeries. By further transforming the search\nprocess into an extremum optimization problem, UVS yields the uniquely update\nvector, which maximizes the simultaneous loss reductions for each data type.\nSecond, a Conflict Gradient Reduction (CGR) module enforces a low-conflict\nfeature embedding space through a novel Conflict Descent Loss. This loss\npenalizes misaligned gradient directions and guides the learning of\nrepresentations with aligned, non-conflicting gradients. The synergy of UVS and\nCGR alleviates gradient interference in both parameter optimization and\nrepresentation learning.

The Sun and fixed stars are the\ntwo primary astronomical sensing objects. Attitude sensors are critical\ncomponents for the survival and knowledge improvement of spacecraft. Of these,\nsun sensors are the most common and important sensor for spacecraft attitude\ndetermination. The sun sensor measures the Sun vector in spacecraft\ncoordinates. The sun sensor calibration process is particularly difficult due\nto the complex nature of the uncertainties involved. The uncertainties are\nsmall, difficult to observe, and vary spatio-temporally over the lifecycle of\nthe sensor. In addition, the sensors are affected by numerous sources of\nuncertainties, including manufacturing, electrical, environmental, and\ninterference sources. This motivates the development of advanced calibration\nalgorithms to minimize uncertainty over the sensor lifecycle and improve\naccuracy. Although modeling and calibration techniques for sun sensors have\nbeen explored extensively in the literature over the past two decades, there is\ncurrently no resource that consolidates and systematically reviews this body of\nwork.

As reasoning models increasingly saturate existing benchmarks\nin mathematics and science, novel and challenging evaluations of model\nintelligence beyond STEM domains are essential. Reasoning is fundamentally\ninvolved in text-based humor comprehension, requiring the identification of\nconnections between concepts in cartoons/captions and external cultural\nreferences, wordplays, and other mechanisms. HumorBench includes approximately\n300 unique cartoon-caption pairs from the New Yorker Caption Contest and\nCartoonstock.com, with expert-annotated evaluation rubrics identifying\nessential joke elements. LLMs are evaluated based on their explanations towards\nthe humor and abilities in identifying the joke elements. To perform well on\nthis task, models must form and test hypotheses about associations between\nconcepts, potentially backtracking from initial interpretations to arrive at\nthe most plausible explanation. Our extensive benchmarking of current SOTA\nmodels reveals three key insights: (1) LLM progress on STEM reasoning transfers\neffectively to humor comprehension; (2) models trained exclusively on STEM\nreasoning data still perform well on HumorBench, demonstrating strong\ntransferability of reasoning abilities; and (3) test-time scaling by increasing\nthinking token budgets yields mixed results across different models in humor\nreasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "HumorBench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u590d\u6742\u5e7d\u9ed8\uff08\u5982\u6f2b\u753b\u6807\u9898\uff09\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8d8b\u4e8e\u9971\u548c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u975eSTEM\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u5e7d\u9ed8\u7406\u89e3\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u65b0\u9896\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "HumorBench\u5305\u542b\u7ea6300\u4e2a\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u6f2b\u753b-\u6807\u9898\u5bf9\uff0c\u6765\u81ea\u300a\u7ebd\u7ea6\u5ba2\u300b\u6807\u9898\u7ade\u8d5b\u548cCartoonstock.com\uff0c\u5e76\u914d\u6709\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u3002LLM\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u91ca\u5e7d\u9ed8\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u7b11\u8bdd\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u524dSOTA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\uff1a\uff081\uff09LLM\u5728STEM\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u5e7d\u9ed8\u7406\u89e3\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8eSTEM\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728HumorBench\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4e00\u3002", "conclusion": "HumorBench\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5e7d\u9ed8\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u3002"}}

Direct preference\noptimization (DPO) is a common strategy for correcting hallucinations by\naligning model outputs with human preferences. Existing DPO strategies\ntypically treat hallucination-related preferences as fixed targets, relying on\nstatic supervision signals during training. This approach tends to overfit to\nsuperficial linguistic cues in preference data, leading to distributional\nrigidity and spurious correlations that impair grounding in causally relevant\nvisual information. To overcome this limitation, we propose TARS, a\ntoken-adaptive preference strategy that reformulates DPO as a min-max\noptimization problem. TARS maximizes token-level distributional shifts under\nsemantic constraints to simulate alignment uncertainty, and simultaneously\nminimizes the expected preference loss under these controlled perturbations.\nThis joint objective preserves causal grounding while mitigating overfitting to\npreference patterns, thereby reducing hallucinations in multimodal reasoning.\nWe evaluate TARS on multiple hallucination benchmarks and find consistently\nstrong performance.

However, their autoregressive decoding is computationally\nexpensive, hence limiting deployment on CPU-based and resource-constrained\ndevices. Speculative decoding (SD) mitigates this issue by using a smaller\ndraft model to propose candidate tokens, which are then verified by the main\nmodel. However, this approach is impractical for devices lacking hardware\naccelerators like GPUs.

Although RE research is rooted in empirical investigation,\nit has paid limited attention to replicating NLP for RE (NLP4RE) studies. The\nrapidly advancing realm of NLP is creating new opportunities for efficient,\nmachine-assisted workflows, which can bring new perspectives and results to the\nforefront. Thus, we replicate and extend a previous NLP4RE study (baseline),\n\"Classifying User Requirements from Online Feedback in Small Dataset\nEnvironments using Deep Learning\", which evaluated different deep learning\nmodels for requirement classification from user reviews. We reproduced the\noriginal results using publicly released source code, thereby helping to\nstrengthen the external validity of the baseline study. We then extended the\nsetup by evaluating model performance on an external dataset and comparing\nresults to a GPT-4o zero-shot classifier. Furthermore, we prepared the\nreplication study ID-card for the baseline study, important for evaluating\nreplication readiness.

While multimodal large\nlanguage models (MLLMs) show strong vision-language reasoning abilities, their\neffectiveness in IAD remains limited without domain-specific adaptation.

While\ntraining-based approaches address this limitation by training on\nhigh-resolution datasets, they require large amounts of data and considerable\ncomputational resources, making them less practical. Consequently,\ntraining-free methods, particularly patch-based approaches, have become a\npopular alternative. These methods divide an image into patches and fuse the\ndenoising paths of each patch, showing strong performance on high-resolution\ngeneration. However, we observe two critical issues for patch-based approaches,\nwhich we call ``patch-level distribution shift\" and ``increased patch\nmonotonicity.\" To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Path Tracing (APT),\na framework that combines Statistical Matching to ensure patch distributions\nremain consistent in upsampled latents and Scale-aware Scheduling to deal with\nthe patch monotonicity.

(2) High-Quality Data.\nThe dataset is curated from university-level examinations and assignments,\nproviding a natural and robust benchmark for assessing the capacity of LLMs to\napply knowledge and make expert-like decisions. (3) Diverse Formats and\nExtensive Scale. AgriEval comprises 14,697 multiple-choice questions and 2,167\nopen-ended question-and-answer questions, establishing it as the most extensive\nagricultural benchmark available to date. We also present comprehensive\nexperimental results over 51 open-source and commercial LLMs. The experimental\nresults reveal that most existing LLMs struggle to achieve 60% accuracy,\nunderscoring the developmental potential in agricultural LLMs. Additionally, we\nconduct extensive experiments to investigate factors influencing model\nperformance and propose strategies for enhancement.

Despite rapid advancements, a\nsubstantial research gap remains in understanding the distinct roles of\ninternal components - knowledge that is essential for improving transparency\nand efficiency. Inspired by neuroscientific ablation studies, which investigate\nthe functions of brain regions through selective impairment, we systematically\nanalyze the impact of ablating key components in three state-of-the-art\ndetection transformer models: Detection transformer (DETR), deformable\ndetection transformer (DDETR), and DETR with improved denoising anchor boxes\n(DINO). The ablations target query embeddings, encoder and decoder multi-head\nself-attentions (MHSA) as well as decoder multi-head cross-attention (MHCA)\nlayers. We evaluate the effects of these ablations on the performance metrics\ngIoU and F1-score, quantifying effects on both the classification and\nregression sub-tasks on the COCO dataset. To facilitate reproducibility and\nfuture research, we publicly release the DeepDissect library. Our findings\nreveal model-specific resilience patterns: while DETR is particularly sensitive\nto ablations in encoder MHSA and decoder MHCA, DDETR's multi-scale deformable\nattention enhances robustness, and DINO exhibits the greatest resilience due to\nits look-forward twice update rule, which helps distributing knowledge across\nblocks. These insights also expose structural redundancies, particularly in\nDDETR's and DINO's decoder MHCA layers, highlighting opportunities for model\nsimplification without sacrificing performance.

Specifically, AdvRF reformulates\nFGIR as a visual discrepancy reconstruction task via synergizing category-aware\ndiscrepancy localization from retrieval models with category-agnostic feature\nlearning from reconstruction models. The reconstruction model exposes residual\ndiscrepancies overlooked by the retrieval model, forcing it to improve\nlocalization accuracy, while the refined signals from the retrieval model guide\nthe reconstruction model to improve its reconstruction ability. Consequently,\nthe retrieval model localizes visual differences, while the reconstruction\nmodel encodes these differences into category-agnostic representations.

To prevent the\nstudent from entirely losing its architecture-specific capabilities, we further\ndesign a lightweight module that decouples the RSD objective from the student's\ninternal representations. Our method is devoid of the architecture-specific\ndesigns and complex operations in the pioneering method of OFA. It outperforms\nOFA on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k benchmarks with only a fraction of their\nparameter overhead, which highlights its potential as a simple and strong\nbaseline to the cross-architecture distillation community.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6291\u5236\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\u5b9e\u73b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u590d\u6742\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f15\u5165\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u8fc7\u591a\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u7b80\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5197\u4f59\u6291\u5236\u84b8\u998f\uff08RSD\uff09\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u6700\u5927\u5316\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u8026\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cf\u6a21\u5757\u4fdd\u62a4\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5b9a\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-100\u548cImageNet-1k\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eOFA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u5f00\u9500\u66f4\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u84b8\u998f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

Among these applications, fundus image analysis\npresents special challenges, including small lesion areas in certain fundus\ndiseases and subtle inter-disease differences, which can lead to reduced\nprediction accuracy and overfitting in the models. To address these challenges,\nthis paper proposes the Transformer-based model SwinECAT, which combines the\nShifted Window (Swin) Attention with the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA)\nAttention. SwinECAT leverages the Swin Attention mechanism in the Swin\nTransformer backbone to effectively capture local spatial structures and\nlong-range dependencies within fundus images. The lightweight ECA mechanism is\nincorporated to guide the SwinECAT's attention toward critical feature\nchannels, enabling more discriminative feature representation. In contrast to\nprevious studies that typically classify fundus images into 4 to 6 categories,\nthis work expands fundus disease classification to 9 distinct types, thereby\nenhancing the granularity of diagnosis. We evaluate our method on the Eye\nDisease Image Dataset (EDID) containing 16,140 fundus images for 9-category\nclassification. Experimental results demonstrate that SwinECAT achieves 88.29\\%\naccuracy, with weighted F1-score of 0.88 and macro F1-score of 0.90.

Although existing methods have shown remarkable performance across\nvarious benchmarks, they are predominantly reliant on accurate pose\ninformation. In real-world scenarios, the acquisition of precise pose often\nrequires additional computational resources and is highly susceptible to noise.\nThese limitations hinder the broad applicability and practicality of such\nmethods.

Electrocardiograms\n(ECGs), especially 12-lead ECGs, play a key role in the identification of CVDs.\nThese are routinely interpreted by human experts, a process that is\ntime-consuming and requires expert knowledge. Historical research in this area\nhas focused on automatic ECG interpretation from digital signals, with recent\ndeep learning approaches achieving strong results. In practice, however, most\nECG data in clinical practice are stored or shared in image form. To bridge\nthis gap, we propose a deep learning framework designed specifically to\nclassify paper-like ECG images into five main diagnostic categories. Our method\nwas the winning entry to the 2024 British Heart Foundation Open Data Science\nChallenge. It addresses two main challenges of paper ECG classification: visual\nnoise (e.g., shadows or creases) and the need to detect fine-detailed waveform\npatterns.

Comprehensive experiments on SMOKE5K and custom IJmond datasets\ndemonstrate that CEDANet achieves an F1-score of 0.414 and a smoke-class IoU of\n0.261 with citizen feedback, vastly outperforming the baseline model, which\nscored 0.083 and 0.043 respectively. This represents a five-fold increase in\nF1-score and a six-fold increase in smoke-class IoU. Notably, CEDANet with\ncitizen-constrained pseudo-labels achieves performance comparable to the same\narchitecture trained on limited 100 fully annotated images with F1-score of\n0.418 and IoU of 0.264, demonstrating its ability to reach small-sampled fully\nsupervised-level accuracy without target-domain annotations.

However, traditional AL methods, developed\nfor images or short video clips, are suboptimal for surgical step recognition\ndue to inter-step dependencies within long, untrimmed surgical videos. These\nmethods typically select individual frames or clips for labeling, which is\nineffective for surgical videos where annotators require the context of the\nentire video for annotation. To address this, we propose StepAL, an active\nlearning framework designed for full video selection in surgical step\nrecognition. StepAL integrates a step-aware feature representation, which\nleverages pseudo-labels to capture the distribution of predicted steps within\neach video, with an entropy-weighted clustering strategy.

Existing FSVOS datasets and methods\ntypically focus on object categories, which are static attributes that ignore\nthe rich temporal dynamics in videos, limiting their application in scenarios\nrequiring motion understanding. To fill this gap, we introduce MOVE, a\nlarge-scale dataset specifically designed for motion-guided FSVOS. Based on\nMOVE, we comprehensively evaluate 6 state-of-the-art methods from 3 different\nrelated tasks across 2 experimental settings. Our results reveal that current\nmethods struggle to address motion-guided FSVOS, prompting us to analyze the\nassociated challenges and propose a baseline method, Decoupled Motion\nAppearance Network (DMA). Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves\nsuperior performance in few shot motion understanding, establishing a solid\nfoundation for future research in this direction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd0\u52a8\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u5272\uff08FSVOS\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165MOVE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578bDMA\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709FSVOS\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u9759\u6001\u5bf9\u8c61\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u9700\u8981\u8fd0\u52a8\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDecoupled Motion Appearance Network (DMA)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0e\u5916\u89c2\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5272\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u5f15\u5bfcFSVOS\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u800cDMA\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8fd0\u52a8\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "conclusion": "DMA\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8fd0\u52a8\u5f15\u5bfcFSVOS\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}
