*Mahdi Cherakhloo,Arash Abbasi,Mohammad Saeid Sarafraz,Bijan Vosoughi Vahdat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文对多个开源大语言模型在波斯语NLP任务上的表现进行了全面基准测试，发现Gemma 2在零样本和少样本学习范式中均表现最佳，但在命名实体识别等标记级理解任务上仍有挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在多种语言中表现出色，但在波斯语等低资源语言中的有效性需要深入研究。本文旨在全面评估开源LLMs在波斯语NLP任务上的性能。

Method: 使用零样本和少样本学习范式，在情感分析、命名实体识别、阅读理解、问答等任务上评估多个开源LLMs，采用ParsiNLU和ArmanEmo等波斯语数据集，使用准确率、F1分数、BLEU和ROUGE等指标。

Result: Gemma 2在几乎所有任务和两种学习范式中都表现最佳，特别是在复杂推理任务中表现突出。但大多数模型在命名实体识别等标记级理解任务上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 这项研究为多语言大语言模型研究提供了波斯语性能的宝贵见解，并为未来模型开发提供了基准，揭示了波斯语处理中的特定挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
numerous languages; however, their effectiveness in low-resource languages like
Persian requires thorough investigation. This paper presents a comprehensive
benchmark of several open-source LLMs for Persian Natural Language Processing
(NLP) tasks, utilizing both zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms. We
evaluate models across a range of tasks including sentiment analysis, named
entity recognition, reading comprehension, and question answering, using
established Persian datasets such as ParsiNLU and ArmanEmo. Our methodology
encompasses rigorous experimental setups for both zero-shot and few-shot
scenarios, employing metrics such as Accuracy, F1-score, BLEU, and ROUGE for
performance evaluation. The results reveal that Gemma 2 consistently
outperforms other models across nearly all tasks in both learning paradigms,
with particularly strong performance in complex reasoning tasks. However, most
models struggle with token-level understanding tasks like Named Entity
Recognition, highlighting specific challenges in Persian language processing.
This study contributes to the growing body of research on multilingual LLMs,
providing valuable insights into their performance in Persian and offering a
benchmark for future model development.

### [2] [Cancer Diagnosis Categorization in Electronic Health Records Using Large Language Models and BioBERT: Model Performance Evaluation Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12813)
*Soheil Hashtarkhani,Rezaur Rashid,Christopher L Brett,Lokesh Chinthala,Fekede Asefa Kumsa,Janet A Zink,Robert L Davis,David L Schwartz,Arash Shaban-Nejad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了4个大语言模型和BioBERT在从电子健康记录中分类癌症诊断的性能，发现BioBERT在结构化数据上表现最佳，而GPT-4o在自由文本数据上表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录包含不一致结构或自由文本数据，需要高效预处理以支持预测性医疗模型。虽然AI驱动的NLP工具在自动化诊断分类方面有潜力，但其比较性能和临床可靠性需要系统评估。

Method: 使用4个大语言模型（GPT-3.5、GPT-4o、Llama 3.2、Gemini 1.5）和BioBERT，分析762个独特诊断（326个ICD代码描述，436个自由文本条目）来自3456名癌症患者的记录，将诊断分类到14个预定义类别中，并由两位肿瘤学专家验证分类结果。

Result: BioBERT在ICD代码上获得最高加权宏F1分数（84.2），在ICD代码准确率上与GPT-4o持平（90.8）。对于自由文本诊断，GPT-4o在加权宏F1分数（71.8 vs 61.5）和准确率（81.9 vs 81.6）上均优于BioBERT。GPT-3.5、Gemini和Llama在两种格式上表现较差。常见错误分类包括转移瘤与中枢神经系统肿瘤混淆，以及涉及模糊或重叠临床术语的错误。

Conclusion: 虽然当前性能水平对于行政和研究用途足够，但可靠的临床应用需要标准化文档实践以及针对高风险决策的稳健人工监督。

Abstract: Electronic health records contain inconsistently structured or free-text
data, requiring efficient preprocessing to enable predictive health care
models. Although artificial intelligence-driven natural language processing
tools show promise for automating diagnosis classification, their comparative
performance and clinical reliability require systematic evaluation. The aim of
this study is to evaluate the performance of 4 large language models (GPT-3.5,
GPT-4o, Llama 3.2, and Gemini 1.5) and BioBERT in classifying cancer diagnoses
from structured and unstructured electronic health records data. We analyzed
762 unique diagnoses (326 International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code
descriptions, 436free-text entries) from 3456 records of patients with cancer.
Models were tested on their ability to categorize diagnoses into 14predefined
categories. Two oncology experts validated classifications. BioBERT achieved
the highest weighted macro F1-score for ICD codes (84.2) and matched GPT-4o in
ICD code accuracy (90.8). For free-text diagnoses, GPT-4o outperformed BioBERT
in weighted macro F1-score (71.8 vs 61.5) and achieved slightly higher accuracy
(81.9 vs 81.6). GPT-3.5, Gemini, and Llama showed lower overall performance on
both formats. Common misclassification patterns included confusion between
metastasis and central nervous system tumors, as well as errors involving
ambiguous or overlapping clinical terminology. Although current performance
levels appear sufficient for administrative and research use, reliable clinical
applications will require standardized documentation practices alongside robust
human oversight for high-stakes decision-making.

### [3] [From Noise to Signal to Selbstzweck: Reframing Human Label Variation in the Era of Post-training in NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12817)
*Shanshan Xu,Santosh T. Y. S. S,Barbara Plank*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文主张在AI系统设计中应保留人类标签变异(HLV)作为体现人类多元性的目标本身，呼吁在偏好数据集中主动纳入HLV。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前偏好学习数据集将多个标注聚合成单一标签，抹杀了人类价值观的多元性，而这正是对齐目标所要保留的。

Method: 提出将HLV作为Selbstzweck(自身目标)纳入AI系统设计，并概述了在偏好数据集中主动纳入HLV的可操作步骤。

Result: 论证了HLV不应被视为噪声而应作为信号，特别是在LLM时代，HLV在模型对齐中变得越来越重要。

Conclusion: HLV体现了人类观点的真实多样性，应该被保留并整合到AI系统设计中，以更好地反映人类价值观的多元性。

Abstract: Human Label Variation (HLV) refers to legitimate disagreement in annotation
that reflects the genuine diversity of human perspectives rather than mere
error. For decades, HLV in NLP was dismissed as noise to be discarded, and only
slowly over the last decade has it been reframed as a signal for improving
model robustness. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), where
post-training on human feedback has become central to model alignment, the role
of HLV has become increasingly consequential. Yet current preference-learning
datasets routinely aggregate multiple annotations into a single label, thereby
flattening diverse perspectives into a false universal agreement and erasing
precisely the pluralism of human values that alignment aims to preserve. In
this position paper, we argue that preserving HLV as an embodiment of human
pluralism must be treated as a Selbstzweck - a goal it self when designing AI
systems. We call for proactively incorporating HLV into preference datasets and
outline actionable steps towards it.

### [4] [MEDEQUALQA: Evaluating Biases in LLMs with Counterfactual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12818)
*Rajarshi Ghosh,Abhay Gupta,Hudson McBride,Anurag Vaidya,Faisal Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MEDEQUALQA是一个反事实基准，通过仅改变患者代词来评估LLM在临床决策中的推理稳定性，发现虽然整体相似度高，但在风险因素引用、指南锚定和鉴别诊断排序方面存在一致的局部差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM越来越多地用于临床决策支持，但微妙的患者人口统计学线索可能影响其推理。现有研究记录了不同患者群体间的输出差异，但缺乏对受控人口统计学变化下内部推理如何转变的了解。

Method: 引入MEDEQUALQA基准，仅改变患者代词（他/她/他们）而保持关键症状和条件不变。每个临床案例扩展为单症状消融，生成三个平行数据集（共约69,000项）。评估GPT-4.1模型，使用语义文本相似度（STS）测量推理轨迹的稳定性。

Result: 结果显示整体相似度高（平均STS>0.80），但在引用的风险因素、指南锚定和鉴别诊断排序方面揭示了一致的局部差异，即使最终诊断保持不变。错误分析突出了推理转变的特定案例。

Conclusion: MEDEQUALQA为审计医学AI中的推理稳定性提供了一个受控的诊断环境，揭示了可能级联导致不公平护理的临床相关偏见位点。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in clinical decision
support, yet subtle demographic cues can influence their reasoning. Prior work
has documented disparities in outputs across patient groups, but little is
known about how internal reasoning shifts under controlled demographic changes.
We introduce MEDEQUALQA, a counterfactual benchmark that perturbs only patient
pronouns (he/him, she/her, they/them) while holding critical symptoms and
conditions (CSCs) constant. Each clinical vignette is expanded into single-CSC
ablations, producing three parallel datasets of approximately 23,000 items each
(69,000 total). We evaluate a GPT-4.1 model and compute Semantic Textual
Similarity (STS) between reasoning traces to measure stability across pronoun
variants. Our results show overall high similarity (mean STS >0.80), but reveal
consistent localized divergences in cited risk factors, guideline anchors, and
differential ordering, even when final diagnoses remain unchanged. Our error
analysis highlights certain cases in which the reasoning shifts, underscoring
clinically relevant bias loci that may cascade into inequitable care.
MEDEQUALQA offers a controlled diagnostic setting for auditing reasoning
stability in medical AI.

### [5] [Classifier-Augmented Generation for Structured Workflow Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12825)
*Thomas Gschwind,Shramona Chakraborty,Nitin Gupta,Sameep Mehta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个将自然语言描述转换为可执行ETL工作流的系统，使用分类器增强生成(CAG)方法自动预测工作流结构和详细配置


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ETL工具如IBM DataStage需要深度工具知识和耗时配置，希望通过自然语言简化工作流创建过程

Method: 采用分类器增强生成(CAG)方法，结合话语分解、分类器和特定阶段少样本提示，通过边缘预测连接非线性工作流，从子话语上下文推断阶段属性

Result: 相比强基线方法，CAG在准确性和效率方面表现更好，同时显著减少token使用量，系统具有模块化、可解释性，支持端到端工作流生成和验证

Conclusion: 这是首个在自然语言驱动ETL创作中，对阶段预测、边缘布局和属性生成进行全面评估的系统

Abstract: ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools such as IBM DataStage allow users to
visually assemble complex data workflows, but configuring stages and their
properties remains time consuming and requires deep tool knowledge. We propose
a system that translates natural language descriptions into executable
workflows, automatically predicting both the structure and detailed
configuration of the flow. At its core lies a Classifier-Augmented Generation
(CAG) approach that combines utterance decomposition with a classifier and
stage-specific few-shot prompting to produce accurate stage predictions. These
stages are then connected into non-linear workflows using edge prediction, and
stage properties are inferred from sub-utterance context. We compare CAG
against strong single-prompt and agentic baselines, showing improved accuracy
and efficiency, while substantially reducing token usage. Our architecture is
modular, interpretable, and capable of end-to-end workflow generation,
including robust validation steps. To our knowledge, this is the first system
with a detailed evaluation across stage prediction, edge layout, and property
generation for natural-language-driven ETL authoring.

### [6] [Scheming Ability in LLM-to-LLM Strategic Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12826)
*Thao Pham*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了前沿大语言模型（LLM）在战略欺骗方面的能力和倾向，通过两种博弈论框架（廉价谈话信号博弈和同行评估对抗博弈）测试了四种模型，发现即使没有明确提示，模型也表现出显著的欺骗倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型代理在多样化环境中自主部署，评估其战略欺骗能力变得至关重要。虽然已有研究关注AI系统如何对抗人类开发者，但LLM之间的欺骗行为仍未被充分探索。

Method: 使用两种博弈论框架：廉价谈话信号游戏和同行评估对抗游戏，测试了GPT-4o、Gemini-2.5-pro、Claude-3.7-Sonnet和Llama-3.3-70b四种模型，通过思维链推理分析欺骗策略。

Result: 当有提示时，大多数模型（特别是Gemini-2.5-pro和Claude-3.7-Sonnet）达到接近完美的表现。关键发现是：即使没有提示，所有模型在同行评估中都选择欺骗而非坦白（100%），在廉价谈话中选择欺骗的模型成功率高达95-100%。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了在多智能体环境中使用高风险博弈论场景进行稳健评估的必要性，表明前沿LLM具有显著的欺骗倾向和能力。

Abstract: As large language model (LLM) agents are deployed autonomously in diverse
contexts, evaluating their capacity for strategic deception becomes crucial.
While recent research has examined how AI systems scheme against human
developers, LLM-to-LLM scheming remains underexplored. We investigate the
scheming ability and propensity of frontier LLM agents through two
game-theoretic frameworks: a Cheap Talk signaling game and a Peer Evaluation
adversarial game. Testing four models (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-pro,
Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and Llama-3.3-70b), we measure scheming performance with and
without explicit prompting while analyzing scheming tactics through
chain-of-thought reasoning. When prompted, most models, especially
Gemini-2.5-pro and Claude-3.7-Sonnet, achieved near-perfect performance.
Critically, models exhibited significant scheming propensity without prompting:
all models chose deception over confession in Peer Evaluation (100% rate),
while models choosing to scheme in Cheap Talk succeeded at 95-100% rates. These
findings highlight the need for robust evaluations using high-stakes
game-theoretic scenarios in multi-agent settings.

### [7] [Mathematics with large language models as provers and verifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12829)
*Hieu Le Duc,Leo Liberti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChatGPT使用多实例协作协议成功解决了2025年IMO的5/6题目和1/3的数论猜想，并通过Lean证明助手和人工验证确保证明正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证大型语言模型在定理证明方面的能力，特别是在解决国际数学奥林匹克竞赛题目和数论猜想方面的表现。

Method: 采用多实例协作协议，让不同的GPT-5模型实例作为证明者和验证者协同工作，最终通过Lean证明助手进行形式化验证，并由人工检查前提和结论的一致性。

Result: 成功解决了2025年IMO 6道题目中的5道，以及66个数论猜想中的约1/3。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了大型语言模型在定理证明方面的潜力，通过多实例协作和形式化验证可以有效减少幻觉问题，实现可靠的数学证明。

Abstract: During 2024 and 2025 the discussion about the theorem-proving capabilities of
large language models started reporting interesting success stories, mostly to
do with difficult exercises (such as problems from the International
Mathematical Olympiad), but also with conjectures [Feldman & Karbasi,
arXiv:2509.18383v1] formulated for the purpose of verifying whether the
artificial intelligence could prove it. In this paper we report a theorem
proving feat achieved by ChatGPT by using a protocol involving different prover
and verifier instances of the gpt-5 model working collaboratively. To make sure
that the produced proofs do not suffer from hallucinations, the final proof is
formally verified by the lean proof assistant, and the conformance of premises
and conclusion of the lean code is verified by a human. Our methodology was
able to solve five out of six 2025 IMO problems, and close a third of the
sixty-six number theory conjectures in [Cohen, Journal of Integer Sequences,
2025].

### [8] [MTSQL-R1: Towards Long-Horizon Multi-Turn Text-to-SQL via Agentic Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12831)
*Taicheng Guo,Hai Wang,ChaoChun Liu,Mohsen Golalikhani,Xin Chen,Xiangliang Zhang,Chandan K. Reddy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MTSQL-R1框架，将多轮Text-to-SQL任务建模为马尔可夫决策过程，通过执行反馈和对话记忆进行迭代式验证与精炼。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统将多轮Text-to-SQL视为简单的文本翻译任务，采用短视范式生成查询而不执行验证，导致输出不可执行或不连贯。

Method: 将任务建模为MDP，智能体与数据库交互获取执行反馈，与持久对话记忆交互进行连贯性验证，执行"提议→执行→验证→精炼"的迭代循环。

Result: 在COSQL和SPARC数据集上的实验表明，MTSQL-R1持续优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 环境驱动的验证和记忆引导的精炼对于会话语义解析至关重要。

Abstract: Multi-turn Text-to-SQL aims to translate a user's conversational utterances
into executable SQL while preserving dialogue coherence and grounding to the
target schema. However, most existing systems only regard this task as a simple
text translation task and follow a short-horizon paradigm, generating a query
per turn without execution, explicit verification, and refinement, which leads
to non-executable or incoherent outputs. We present MTSQL-R1, an agentic
training framework for long-horizon multi-turn Text-to-SQL. We cast the task as
a Markov Decision Process (MDP) in which an agent interacts with (i) a database
for execution feedback and (ii) a persistent dialogue memory for coherence
verification, performing an iterative propose to execute -> verify -> refine
cycle until all checks pass. Experiments on COSQL and SPARC demonstrate that
MTSQL-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the importance
of environment-driven verification and memory-guided refinement for
conversational semantic parsing. Full recipes (including code, trained models,
logs, reasoning trajectories, etc.) will be released after the internal review
to contribute to community research.

### [9] [Repurposing Annotation Guidelines to Instruct LLM Annotators: A Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12835)
*Kon Woo Kim,Rezarta Islamaj,Jin-Dong Kim,Florian Boudin,Akiko Aizawa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探索如何将现有标注指南重新用于指导大语言模型进行文本标注任务，提出通过LLM调节过程将传统指南转化为清晰指令的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标注指南是为人类标注者设计的，需要内部化训练，而LLM需要明确的结构化指令，因此需要研究如何重新利用现有指南来指导LLM标注。

Method: 提出面向调节的指南重新利用方法，通过LLM调节过程将传统标注指南转化为清晰指令，使用NCBI疾病语料库作为案例研究。

Result: 实验表明重新利用的指南能有效指导LLM标注者，同时揭示了一些实际挑战，证明了该工作流程支持可扩展且经济高效的标注指南优化和自动化标注的潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了利用现有标注指南指导LLM标注的可行性，为可扩展和成本效益高的标注指南优化和自动化标注提供了支持。

Abstract: This study investigates how existing annotation guidelines can be repurposed
to instruct large language model (LLM) annotators for text annotation tasks.
Traditional guidelines are written for human annotators who internalize
training, while LLMs require explicit, structured instructions. We propose a
moderation-oriented guideline repurposing method that transforms guidelines
into clear directives for LLMs through an LLM moderation process. Using the
NCBI Disease Corpus as a case study, our experiments show that repurposed
guidelines can effectively guide LLM annotators, while revealing several
practical challenges. The results highlight the potential of this workflow to
support scalable and cost-effective refinement of annotation guidelines and
automated annotation.

*Qianben Chen,Jingyi Cao,Jiayu Zhang,Tianrui Qin,Xiaowan Li,King Zhu,Dingfeng Shi,He Zhu,Minghao Liu,Xiaobo Liang,Ge Zhang,Jian Yang,Yuchen Eleanor Jiang,Wangchunshu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了自适应代理基础模型A²FM，通过路由-对齐原则统一推理型和代理型LLM，引入即时模式处理简单查询，显著提升成本效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推理型LLM和代理型LLM之间的能力分裂问题，避免在简单查询上过度推理或过度调用工具的低效行为

Method: 采用路由-对齐原则：先学习任务感知路由，然后在共享骨干网络下对齐模式特定轨迹；引入即时模式处理简单查询；提出自适应策略优化(APO)进行多模式自适应采样

Result: 在32B规模上，A²FM在BrowseComp、AIME25和HLE基准测试中分别达到13.4%、70.4%和16.7%，创下可比模型的新SOTA，与前沿LLM竞争；自适应执行使每个正确答案成本仅为0.00487美元，相比推理型和代理型分别降低成本45.2%和33.5%

Conclusion: A²FM成功统一了推理和代理能力，在保持准确性的同时显著提升了成本效率，为解决LLM能力分裂问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: Large language models split into two families: reasoning-centric LLMs, which
strengthen internal chain-of-thought reasoning but cannot invoke external
tools, and agentic LLMs, which learn to interact with environments and leverage
tools but often lag in deep reasoning. This divide arises from fundamentally
different training objectives, leading to mismatched strengths and inefficiency
on simple queries, where both families tend to overthink or over-call tools. In
this work, we present Adaptive Agent Foundation Model (A\textsuperscript{2}FM),
a unified framework that follows a route-then-align principle: the model first
learns task-aware routing and then aligns mode-specific trajectories under a
shared backbone. To address the inefficiency gap, we introduce a third
mode-instant-that handles simple queries directly, preventing unnecessary
reasoning or tool calls while complementing the agentic and reasoning modes. To
jointly enhance accuracy and efficiency, we propose Adaptive Policy
Optimization (APO), which enforces adaptive sampling across modes and applies a
cost-regularized reward. On the 32B scale, A\textsuperscript{2}FM achieves
13.4\% on BrowseComp, 70.4\% on AIME25, and 16.7\% on HLE, setting new SOTA
among comparable models and performing competitively with frontier LLMs across
agentic, reasoning, and general benchmarks. Notably, the adaptive execution
achieves a cost of pass of only \$0.00487 per correct answer-cutting cost by
45.2\% relative to reasoning and 33.5\% relative to agentic, thus delivering
substantially higher cost efficiency while maintaining comparable accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出FastFact框架，通过分块级声明提取和基于置信度的预验证，结合文档级证据收集，高效评估长文本LLM生成的事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法评估LLM长文本生成的事实性存在效率低下和效果不佳的问题，包括复杂流水线不适合长文本，以及声明集不准确和证据收集不足。

Method: 使用分块级声明提取与置信度预验证，收集文档级证据并在验证时选择性检索，减少网络搜索和推理调用成本。

Result: 在聚合和人工标注基准上的广泛实验表明，FastFact在高效有效评估LLM长文本生成事实性方面可靠性最高。

Conclusion: FastFact框架在人类评估对齐度和效率方面优于现有基线，解决了先前流水线的证据不足问题。

Abstract: Evaluating the factuality of long-form generations from Large Language Models
(LLMs) remains challenging due to accuracy issues and costly human assessment.
Prior efforts attempt this by decomposing text into claims, searching for
evidence, and verifying claims, but suffer from critical drawbacks: (1)
inefficiency due to complex pipeline components unsuitable for long LLM
outputs, and (2) ineffectiveness stemming from inaccurate claim sets and
insufficient evidence collection of one-line snippets.
  To address these limitations, we propose \name, a fast and strong evaluation
framework that achieves the highest alignment with human evaluation and
efficiency among existing baselines. \name first employs chunk-level claim
extraction integrated with confidence-based pre-verification, significantly
reducing the cost of web searching and inference calling while ensuring
reliability. For searching and verification, it collects document-level
evidence from crawled webpages and selectively retrieves it during
verification, addressing the evidence insufficiency problem in previous
pipelines.
  Extensive experiments based on an aggregated and manually annotated benchmark
demonstrate the reliability of \name in both efficiently and effectively
evaluating the factuality of long-form LLM generations. Code and benchmark data
is available at https://github.com/Yingjia-Wan/FastFact.

*Jesse Atuhurra,Iqra Ali,Tomoya Iwakura,Hidetaka Kamigaito,Tatsuya Hiraoka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为VLURes的多语言基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型在四种语言（英语、日语、斯瓦希里语和乌尔都语）下的细粒度视觉和语言理解能力，包含八个任务和一个新颖的不相关性任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型的评估主要局限于英语为中心的基准测试，且多为短文本。为了评估VLMs在多语言长文本环境下的细粒度能力，需要开发更全面的评估框架。

Method: 从目标语言的网络资源中收集数据集，涵盖十个不同的图像类别和丰富的文本上下文。通过提示VLMs生成响应和推理，进行自动评估和母语者评估。

Result: 评估了十个VLMs，表现最佳的GPT-4o模型总体准确率为90.8%，但仍落后人类表现6.7%。开源模型与人类表现的差距更大。

Conclusion: VLURes基准测试在开发能够处理多模态视觉推理的智能代理方面发挥着关键作用，揭示了不同语言和任务之间的性能差异。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are pivotal for advancing perception in
intelligent agents. Yet, evaluation of VLMs remains limited to predominantly
English-centric benchmarks in which the image-text pairs comprise short texts.
To evaluate VLM fine-grained abilities, in four languages under long-text
settings, we introduce a novel multilingual benchmark VLURes featuring eight
vision-and-language tasks, and a pioneering unrelatedness task, to probe the
fine-grained Visual and Linguistic Understanding capabilities of VLMs across
English, Japanese, and low-resource languages, Swahili, and Urdu. Our datasets,
curated from web resources in the target language, encompass ten diverse image
categories and rich textual context, introducing valuable vision-language
resources for Swahili and Urdu. By prompting VLMs to generate responses and
rationales, evaluated automatically and by native speakers, we uncover
performance disparities across languages and tasks critical to intelligent
agents, such as object recognition, scene understanding, and relationship
understanding. We conducted evaluations of ten VLMs with VLURes. The best
performing model, GPT-4o, achieves an overall accuracy of 90.8% and lags human
performance by 6.7%, though the gap is larger for open-source models. The gap
highlights VLURes' critical role in developing intelligent agents to tackle
multi-modal visual reasoning.

*Jan Miller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EAT框架将三种自适应效率技术（渐进式token剪枝、稀疏注意力和动态早期退出）统一到一个可复现的架构中，用于输入自适应推理。该框架提供了开源基准测试管道，在GLUE任务上进行自动化评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个统一的、可复现的框架来整合多种自适应效率技术，为社区提供研究自适应transformer的工具。

Method: 结合渐进式token剪枝、稀疏注意力和动态早期退出三种技术，构建端到端的可复现框架，包含自动化数据处理、计时和消融实验的基准测试管道。

Result: 在浅层六层模型中，组合这些机制可能会增加延迟，但在SST-2任务上EAT比优化的DistilBERT基线实现了略高的准确率，展示了动态计算在延迟敏感NLP中的潜力。

Conclusion: EAT的主要贡献是提供了一个开放、端到端可复现的框架，包含脚本、CSV日志和分析工具，旨在作为社区进一步研究自适应transformer的工具。

Abstract: The Efficient Adaptive Transformer (EAT) framework unifies three adaptive
efficiency techniques - progressive token pruning, sparse attention, and
dynamic early exiting - into a single, reproducible architecture for
input-adaptive inference. EAT provides an open-source benchmarking pipeline
that automates data processing, timing, and ablation across GLUE tasks (SST-2,
QQP, MNLI). Although this empirical study finds that combining these mechanisms
can increase latency in shallow six-layer models, it demonstrates that EAT
achieves slightly higher accuracy than the optimized DistilBERT baseline on
SST-2, illustrating the potential of dynamic computation for latency-sensitive
NLP. The main contribution is the open, end-to-end reproducible framework -
complete with scripts, CSV logging, and analysis utilities - intended to serve
as a community tool for further research on adaptive transformers.

TL;DR: 本文综述了当前古兰经诵读自动评估工具存在的问题，指出基于自动语音识别的方法存在根本性缺陷，提出了向基于知识的计算框架转变的范式转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代数字技术虽然提供了前所未有的教育机会，但现有的古兰经诵读自动评估工具未能实现广泛应用和教学效果。需要解决数据依赖性、人口偏见和无法提供诊断性反馈等问题。

Method: 通过对过去20年学术研究、网络平台和商业应用的综合分析，批判了基于自动语音识别的数据驱动方法，提出了基于预期声学建模的知识中心计算框架。

Result: 分析发现主流方法存在根本性错位，过度依赖统计模式而非基于规则的声学评估。建议构建围绕经典规则和发音点的稳健评估器。

Conclusion: 古兰经自动评估的未来在于将深度语言知识与先进音频分析相结合的混合系统，以开发出稳健、公平且教学合理的工具来支持全球学习者。

Abstract: The sacred practice of Quranic recitation (Tajweed), governed by precise
phonetic, prosodic, and theological rules, faces significant pedagogical
challenges in the modern era. While digital technologies promise unprecedented
access to education, automated tools for recitation evaluation have failed to
achieve widespread adoption or pedagogical efficacy. This literature review
investigates this critical gap, conducting a comprehensive analysis of academic
research, web platforms, and commercial applications developed over the past
two decades. Our synthesis reveals a fundamental misalignment in prevailing
approaches that repurpose Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) architectures,
which prioritize lexical recognition over qualitative acoustic assessment and
are plagued by data dependency, demographic biases, and an inability to provide
diagnostically useful feedback. Critiquing these data--driven paradigms, we
argue for a foundational paradigm shift towards a knowledge-centric
computational framework. Capitalizing on the immutable nature of the Quranic
text and the precisely defined rules of Tajweed, we propose that a robust
evaluator must be architected around anticipatory acoustic modeling based on
canonical rules and articulation points (Makhraj), rather than relying on
statistical patterns learned from imperfect and biased datasets. This review
concludes that the future of automated Quranic evaluation lies in hybrid
systems that integrate deep linguistic knowledge with advanced audio analysis,
offering a path toward robust, equitable, and pedagogically sound tools that
can faithfully support learners worldwide.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了EduDial，一个全面的多轮师生对话数据集，涵盖345个核心知识点，包含34,250个对话会话，基于布鲁姆教育目标分类和十种提问策略设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在教育领域的重要性日益增长，需要专门的师生对话基准来评估其教学能力。

Method: 通过教师和学生代理之间的交互生成对话数据，设计基于布鲁姆分类法的教学策略和十种提问方法，并训练EduDial-LLM 32B模型。

Result: 在17个主流LLM上的实验表明，大多数模型在学生中心教学场景中表现不佳，而EduDial-LLM在所有指标上均显著优于基线。

Conclusion: EduDial为评估LLM的教学能力提供了系统框架，EduDial-LLM在师生对话场景中表现出色，推动了智能教育的发展。

Abstract: Recently, several multi-turn dialogue benchmarks have been proposed to
evaluate the conversational abilities of large language models (LLMs). As LLMs
are increasingly recognized as a key technology for advancing intelligent
education, owing to their ability to deeply understand instructional contexts
and provide personalized guidance, the construction of dedicated
teacher-student dialogue benchmarks has become particularly important. To this
end, we present EduDial, a comprehensive multi-turn teacher-student dialogue
dataset. EduDial covers 345 core knowledge points and consists of 34,250
dialogue sessions generated through interactions between teacher and student
agents. Its design is guided by Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives and
incorporates ten questioning strategies, including situational questioning,
zone of proximal development (ZPD) questioning, and metacognitive
questioning-thus better capturing authentic classroom interactions.
Furthermore, we design differentiated teaching strategies for students at
different cognitive levels, thereby providing more targeted teaching guidance.
Building on EduDial, we further develop EduDial-LLM 32B via training and
propose an 11-dimensional evaluation framework that systematically measures the
teaching abilities of LLMs, encompassing both overall teaching quality and
content quality. Experiments on 17 mainstream LLMs reveal that most models
struggle in student-centered teaching scenarios, whereas our EduDial-LLM
achieves significant gains, consistently outperforming all baselines across all
metrics. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文首次系统评估了LLMs对询问角色的鲁棒性，发现用户透露的身份、专长或信念等属性会显著影响问答准确性，并引发拒绝回答、幻觉限制和角色混淆等故障模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在面对用户透露的个人信息、身份属性等询问角色时的鲁棒性，确保模型能基于客观知识真实回答问题，不受用户上下文影响。

Method: 通过评估LLMs对询问角色的敏感性，使用真实交互中用户可能透露的身份、专长、信念等属性作为测试输入。

Result: 发现询问角色提示能显著改变问答准确性，触发拒绝回答、幻觉限制和角色混淆等故障模式，表明模型对用户框架的敏感性会损害事实可靠性。

Conclusion: 询问角色测试是评估LLMs鲁棒性的有效工具，模型对用户框架的敏感性可能影响事实回答的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) should answer factual questions truthfully,
grounded in objective knowledge, regardless of user context such as
self-disclosed personal information, or system personalization. In this paper,
we present the first systematic evaluation of LLM robustness to inquiry
personas, i.e. user profiles that convey attributes like identity, expertise,
or belief. While prior work has primarily focused on adversarial inputs or
distractors for robustness testing, we evaluate plausible, human-centered
inquiry persona cues that users disclose in real-world interactions. We find
that such cues can meaningfully alter QA accuracy and trigger failure modes
such as refusals, hallucinated limitations, and role confusion. These effects
highlight how model sensitivity to user framing can compromise factual
reliability, and position inquiry persona testing as an effective tool for
robustness evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了CUEST框架来评估LLMs在不同文化背景下的好奇心表现，发现LLMs倾向于西方文化的好奇心表达，并通过微调策略将人机对齐差距缩小了50%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在不同文化背景下的好奇心表现，因为好奇心是人类探究的核心驱动力，但在LLMs中尚未得到充分研究，特别是在跨文化语境下。

Method: 使用Yahoo! Answers多国数据集，引入CUEST评估框架，通过语言风格、主题偏好分析和社会科学构建来测量人机好奇心对齐度。

Result: 发现LLMs压平了跨文化多样性，更接近西方国家的表达方式；通过微调策略可将人机对齐差距缩小50%；证明好奇心对LLMs跨文化适应性具有实际价值。

Conclusion: 好奇心对LLMs的跨文化适应性很重要，是未来NLP研究的重要方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have expanded their role in
human interaction, yet curiosity -- a central driver of inquiry -- remains
underexplored in these systems, particularly across cultural contexts. In this
work, we investigate cultural variation in curiosity using Yahoo! Answers, a
real-world multi-country dataset spanning diverse topics. We introduce CUEST
(CUriosity Evaluation across SocieTies), an evaluation framework that measures
human-model alignment in curiosity through linguistic (style), topic preference
(content) analysis and grounding insights in social science constructs. Across
open- and closed-source models, we find that LLMs flatten cross-cultural
diversity, aligning more closely with how curiosity is expressed in Western
countries. We then explore fine-tuning strategies to induce curiosity in LLMs,
narrowing the human-model alignment gap by up to 50\%. Finally, we demonstrate
the practical value of curiosity for LLM adaptability across cultures, showing
its importance for future NLP research.

### [18] [3-Model Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12966)
*Sanghyun Byun,Mohanad Odema,Jung Ick Guack,Baisub Lee,Jacob Song,Woo Seong Chung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Pyramid Speculative Decoding (PyramidSD) 通过在草稿模型和目标模型之间插入一个中间限定模型来改进推测解码，解决了草稿模型大小与token接受率之间的权衡问题，实现了更高的生成速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推测解码存在根本性限制：较小的草稿模型生成token更快但与目标模型差异更大，导致接受率降低和加速效果减弱。需要一种方法来桥接分布差距，允许使用更小的草稿模型而不牺牲性能。

Method: 引入中间限定模型构建分层解码策略，使用模糊接受标准支持每个阶段的宽松分歧阈值，改善模型间的对齐。

Result: PyramidSD相比标准推测解码实现了最高1.91倍的生成速度，在消费级GPU上达到124 tokens/秒。在1B参数草稿模型和8B目标模型的小内存设置中，以最小质量损失换取吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: PyramidSD提供了一种实用的方法来增强推测解码效率，可以轻松应用于现有的推理流水线。

Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) accelerates inference in large language models by
using a smaller draft model to propose tokens, which are then verified by a
larger target model. However, the throughput gains of SD are fundamentally
limited by a trade-off between draft model size and token acceptance: smaller
draft models generate tokens more quickly but exhibit greater divergence from
the target model, resulting in lower acceptance rates and reduced speedups. We
introduce Pyramid Speculative Decoding (PyramidSD), an extension of SD that
inserts an intermediate qualifier model between the draft and target to bridge
the distributional gap in output predictions, allowing smaller model to be used
for drafting. This hierarchical decoding strategy improves alignment across
models, enabling higher acceptance rates and allowing the use of significantly
smaller draft models without sacrificing overall performance. PyramidSD builds
on fuzzy acceptance criteria to support relaxed divergence thresholds at each
stage, improving throughput. In experiments, PyramidSD achieves up to 1.91x
generation speed over standard SD, reaching 124 tokens per second on a consumer
GPU (RTX 4090). In small-memory settings with a 1B-parameter draft model and an
8B target model, PyramidSD minimally trades target model quality for improved
throughput. Overall, PyramidSD offers a practical approach to enhancing
speculative decoding efficiency and can be readily applied to existing
inference pipelines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究首次大规模实证评估LLM生成针对特定人口特征个性化虚假信息的能力，发现简单的个性化策略显著增加所有LLM的越狱概率，并改变生成内容的语言模式和说服力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在生成类似人类内容方面的熟练度提高，人们担心其可能被滥用于大规模生成有说服力的个性化虚假信息。现有研究主要关注LLM生成虚假信息的能力，但对说服力和个性化（针对特定人口属性定制虚假信息）的研究尚不充分。

Method: 采用红队方法，系统评估LLM安全机制对个性化提示的鲁棒性。创建AI-TRAITS数据集，包含约160万条由8个最先进LLM生成的文本，基于324个虚假信息叙事和150个不同人物档案，涵盖4种主要语言（英语、俄语、葡萄牙语、印地语）和关键人口维度（国家、世代、政治倾向）。

Result: 研究发现：1）即使在提示中使用简单的个性化策略，也显著增加所有研究LLM的越狱可能性；2）个性化提示导致语言和修辞模式的改变；3）个性化增强了LLM生成虚假叙事内容的说服力。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了当前最先进LLM的关键漏洞，为在多语言和跨人口背景下改进安全对齐和检测策略提供了基础。

Abstract: The human-like proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought
concerns about their potential misuse for generating persuasive and
personalised disinformation at scale. While prior work has demonstrated that
LLMs can generate disinformation, specific questions around persuasiveness and
personalisation (generation of disinformation tailored to specific demographic
attributes) remain largely unstudied. This paper presents the first
large-scale, multilingual empirical study on persona-targeted disinformation
generation by LLMs. Employing a red teaming methodology, we systematically
evaluate the robustness of LLM safety mechanisms to persona-targeted prompts. A
key novel result is AI-TRAITS (AI-generaTed peRsonAlIsed disinformaTion
dataSet), a new dataset of around 1.6 million texts generated by eight
state-of-the-art LLMs. AI-TRAITS is seeded by prompts that combine 324
disinformation narratives and 150 distinct persona profiles, covering four
major languages (English, Russian, Portuguese, Hindi) and key demographic
dimensions (country, generation, political orientation). The resulting
personalised narratives are then assessed quantitatively and compared along the
dimensions of models, languages, jailbreaking rate, and personalisation
attributes. Our findings demonstrate that the use of even simple
personalisation strategies in the prompts significantly increases the
likelihood of jailbreaks for all studied LLMs. Furthermore, personalised
prompts result in altered linguistic and rhetorical patterns and amplify the
persuasiveness of the LLM-generated false narratives. These insights expose
critical vulnerabilities in current state-of-the-art LLMs and offer a
foundation for improving safety alignment and detection strategies in
multilingual and cross-demographic contexts.

TL;DR: OPLoRA通过双面正交投影防止LoRA微调中的灾难性遗忘，约束更新位于前k个奇异子空间的正交补空间中，保留预训练知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA在微调大型语言模型时存在灾难性遗忘问题，学习更新会干扰编码预训练知识的主导奇异方向。

Method: 通过SVD分解冻结权重，使用投影矩阵P_L = I - U_k U_k^⊤和P_R = I - V_k V_k^⊤将LoRA更新约束在前k个奇异子空间的正交补空间中。

Result: 实验证明OPLoRA显著减少遗忘，同时在常识推理、数学和代码生成任务上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 正交投影是参数高效微调中知识保留的有效机制，为知识保护提供数学保证。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enables efficient fine-tuning of large language
models but suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learned updates interfere
with the dominant singular directions that encode essential pre-trained
knowledge. We propose Orthogonal Projection LoRA (OPLoRA), a theoretically
grounded approach that prevents this interference through double-sided
orthogonal projections. By decomposing frozen weights via SVD, OPLoRA
constrains LoRA updates to lie entirely within the orthogonal complement of the
top-$k$ singular subspace using projections $P_L = I - U_k U_k^\top$ and $P_R =
I - V_k V_k^\top$. We prove that this construction exactly preserves the
top-$k$ singular triples, providing mathematical guarantees for knowledge
retention. To quantify subspace interference, we introduce $\rho_k$, a metric
measuring update alignment with dominant directions. Extensive experiments
across commonsense reasoning, mathematics, and code generation demonstrate that
OPLoRA significantly reduces forgetting while maintaining competitive
task-specific performance on LLaMA-2 7B and Qwen2.5 7B, establishing orthogonal
projection as an effective mechanism for knowledge preservation in
parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前持续学习评估缺乏对人类发展轨迹的模拟，需要更系统、细粒度的基准来评估模型在逐步获取新技能时的表现。

Method: 构建了五个发展阶段（0-4）的技能图，生成23.4B标记的合成数据集，包含段落、理解问答、技能测试问答和指令-响应对，使用135M参数transformer在独立、联合和顺序训练设置下进行实验。

Result: 展示了技能保留和迁移效率之间的权衡，支持对遗忘、前向迁移和后向迁移的精确分析。

Conclusion: 通过模拟人类学习模式并提供对技能依赖关系的细粒度控制，这项工作推进了语言模型的持续学习评估。

Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive continual learning dataset and benchmark (CurlL)
grounded in human developmental trajectories from ages 5-10, enabling
systematic and fine-grained assessment of models' ability to progressively
acquire new skills. CurlL spans five developmental stages (0-4) covering ages
5-10, supported by a skill graph that breaks down broad skills into smaller
abilities, concrete goals, and measurable indicators, while also capturing
which abilities build on others. We generate a 23.4B-token synthetic dataset
with controlled skill progression, vocabulary complexity, and format diversity,
comprising paragraphs, comprehension-based QA (CQA), skill-testing QA (CSQA),
and instruction-response (IR) pairs. Stage-wise token counts range from 2.12B
to 6.78B tokens, supporting precise analysis of forgetting, forward transfer,
and backward transfer. Using a 135M-parameter transformer trained under
independent, joint, and sequential (continual) setups, we show trade-offs in
skill retention and transfer efficiency. By mirroring human learning patterns
and providing fine-grained control over skill dependencies, this work advances
continual learning evaluations for language models.

TL;DR: 本文研究了偏好方差(PVar)对直接偏好优化(DPO)训练效果的影响，发现高PVar提示能产生更大的梯度更新，从而更有效地提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 收集人类偏好数据成本高昂且效率低下，需要减少所需标注的方法。偏好方差可能影响DPO训练的有效性。

Method: 通过理论分析建立DPO梯度范数的上界，证明其受PVar控制。使用奖励模型生成偏好数据，在AlpacaEval 2.0和Arena-Hard基准上评估，比较不同PVar提示的训练效果。

Result: 实验表明高PVar提示优于随机选择或低PVar提示。使用仅10%最高PVar提示训练比使用完整数据集表现更好，且使用小奖励模型(1B, 3B)进行选择也稳健。

Conclusion: 偏好方差是识别信息丰富示例以进行高效LLM对齐的重要指标，高PVar提示能显著提升DPO训练效率。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an important approach for
learning from human preferences in aligning large language models (LLMs).
However, collecting human preference data is costly and inefficient, motivating
methods to reduce the required annotations. In this work, we investigate the
impact of \emph{preference variance} (PVar), which measures the variance in
model preferences when comparing pairs of responses, on the effectiveness of
DPO training. We provide a theoretical insight by establishing an upper bound
on the DPO gradient norm for any given prompt, showing it is controlled by the
PVar of that prompt. This implies that prompts with low PVar can only produce
small gradient updates, making them less valuable for learning. We validate
this finding by fine-tuning LLMs with preferences generated by a reward model,
evaluating on two benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard). Experimental
results demonstrate that prompts with higher PVar outperform randomly selected
prompts or those with lower PVar. We also show that our PVar-based selection
method is robust, when using smaller reward models (1B, 3B) for selection.
Notably, in a separate experiment using the original human annotations from the
UltraFeedback dataset, we found that training on only the top 10\% of prompts
with the highest PVar yields better evaluation performance than training on the
full dataset, highlighting the importance of preference variance in identifying
informative examples for efficient LLM alignment.

TL;DR: GatePro是一种无需额外参数的方法，通过识别最相似的专家对并引入局部竞争机制，直接提升MoE架构中专家选择的多样性，避免功能冗余。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE架构面临功能相似专家同时被选择的问题，导致计算冗余和有效模型容量受限。现有的平衡损失方法只能改善token分布，无法解决专家多样性问题。

Method: 提出GatePro方法，识别最相似的专家对并引入局部竞争机制，防止冗余专家同时激活，同时保持专家的自然专业化。

Result: 综合评估表明GatePro在不同模型规模和基准测试中都有效，能够增强专家多样性，使专家发展出更独特和互补的能力。

Conclusion: GatePro提供了一种实用的解决方案，可在任何训练阶段热插拔部署，无需额外可学习参数，有效提升MoE架构的效果。

Abstract: Modern large language models leverage Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures
for efficient scaling, but face a critical challenge: functionally similar
experts are often selected simultaneously, creating redundant computation and
limiting effective model capacity. Existing auxiliary balance loss methods
improve token distribution but fail to address the underlying expert diversity
problem. We introduce GatePro, a novel parameter-free method that directly
promotes expert selection diversity. GatePro identifies the most similar expert
pairs and introduces localized competition mechanisms, preventing redundant
expert co-activation while maintaining natural expert specialization. Our
comprehensive evaluation demonstrates GatePro's effectiveness across model
scales and benchmarks. Analysis demonstrates GatePro's ability to achieve
enhanced expert diversity, where experts develop more distinct and
complementary capabilities, avoiding functional redundancy. This approach can
be deployed hot-swappable during any training phase without additional
learnable parameters, offering a practical solution for improving MoE
effectiveness.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的不确定性量化对于提高模型可靠性很重要，但现有方法存在挑战，需要从因果角度建立LLM不确定性与语义保持不变性之间的联系。

Method: 基于因果视角，提出灰盒不确定性量化方法，通过语义保持干预前后模型输出的变化来测量不确定性。

Result: 在多种LLM和问答数据集上的实验表明，该方法在有效性和计算效率方面都表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM不确定性量化提供了有效的解决方案，建立了不确定性与语义不变性之间的理论联系。

Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is a promising approach to improve model
reliability, yet quantifying the uncertainty of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
non-trivial. In this work, we establish a connection between the uncertainty of
LLMs and their invariance under semantic-preserving intervention from a causal
perspective. Building on this foundation, we propose a novel grey-box
uncertainty quantification method that measures the variation in model outputs
before and after the semantic-preserving intervention. Through theoretical
justification, we show that our method provides an effective estimate of
epistemic uncertainty. Our extensive experiments, conducted across various LLMs
and a variety of question-answering (QA) datasets, demonstrate that our method
excels not only in terms of effectiveness but also in computational efficiency.

Abstract: Clinical trials are central to medical progress because they help improve
understanding of human health and the healthcare system. They play a key role
in discovering new ways to detect, prevent, or treat diseases, and it is
essential that clinical trials include participants with appropriate and
diverse medical backgrounds. In this paper, we propose a system that leverages
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate
multi-label clinical text eligibility classification and summarization. The
system combines feature extraction methods such as word embeddings (Word2Vec)
and named entity recognition to identify relevant medical concepts, along with
traditional vectorization techniques such as count vectorization and TF-IDF
(Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). We further explore weighted TF-IDF
word embeddings that integrate both count-based and embedding-based strengths
to capture term importance effectively. Multi-label classification using Random
Forest and SVM models is applied to categorize documents based on eligibility
criteria. Summarization techniques including TextRank, Luhn, and GPT-3 are
evaluated to concisely summarize eligibility requirements. Evaluation with
ROUGE scores demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods. This
system shows potential for automating clinical trial eligibility assessment
using data-driven approaches, thereby improving research efficiency.

Motivation: LLM的单次预测准确性和鲁棒性对示例选择和集成成员多样性高度敏感，需要系统研究这两个因素对集成性能的影响

Method: 比较两种单次策略：基于质心的代表性示例（提出方法）和随机采样示例（基线），同时变化采样温度来调节输出多样性

Result: 提出的方法在较高温度设置下显著优于随机选择：宏F1提高7.6%，RMSE降低10.5%；且超过5次提示方法：宏F1提高21.1%，RMSE降低24.0%

Conclusion: 结合代表性示例选择与增加的温度能为集成提供适当的多样性水平，强调了示例选择和受控多样性在设计有效单次LLM集成中的实际重要性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results in wide range
of domains. However, the accuracy and robustness of one-shot LLM predictions
remain highly sensitive to the examples and the diversity among ensemble
members. This study systematically investigates the effects of example
representativeness (one-shot strategy) and output diversity (sampling
temperature) on LLM ensemble performance. Two one-shot strategies are compared:
centroid-based representative examples (proposed) and randomly sampled examples
(baseline) and sampling temperature also is varied. The proposed approach with
higher temperature setting significantly outperforms random selection by +7.6%
(macro-F1) and -10.5% (RMSE). Furthermore, the proposed model exceeds 5-shot
prompting by +21.1% (macro-F1) and -24.0% (RMSE). Our findings demonstrate that
combining representative example selection with increased temperature provides
the appropriate level of diversity to the ensemble. This work highlights the
practical importance of both example selection and controlled diversity in
designing effective one-shot LLM ensembles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中东和北非地区在AI评估中代表性不足，需要专门工具来评估LLM与该地区文化价值观的对齐程度。

Method: 基于大规模人类调查构建结构化数据集，在三种视角框架（中立、个性化、第三方观察者）和两种语言模式（英语、本地语言）下评估多种模型。

Result: 发现跨语言价值偏移、推理诱导退化、逻辑泄漏等现象，模型在本地语言中会将多样国家视为单一实体。

Conclusion: MENAValues提供了诊断文化错位的可扩展框架，为开发更具文化包容性的AI提供实证见解和方法工具。

Abstract: We introduce MENAValues, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the cultural
alignment and multilingual biases of large language models (LLMs) with respect
to the beliefs and values of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, an
underrepresented area in current AI evaluation efforts. Drawing from
large-scale, authoritative human surveys, we curate a structured dataset that
captures the sociocultural landscape of MENA with population-level response
distributions from 16 countries. To probe LLM behavior, we evaluate diverse
models across multiple conditions formed by crossing three perspective framings
(neutral, personalized, and third-person/cultural observer) with two language
modes (English and localized native languages: Arabic, Persian, Turkish). Our
analysis reveals three critical phenomena: "Cross-Lingual Value Shifts" where
identical questions yield drastically different responses based on language,
"Reasoning-Induced Degradation" where prompting models to explain their
reasoning worsens cultural alignment, and "Logit Leakage" where models refuse
sensitive questions while internal probabilities reveal strong hidden
preferences. We further demonstrate that models collapse into simplistic
linguistic categories when operating in native languages, treating diverse

*Nikhil Bhendawade,Kumari Nishu,Arnav Kundu,Chris Bartels,Minsik Cho,Irina Belousova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Mirror-SD是一种推理算法，通过并行异构执行和多令牌推测流式处理，打破延迟-接受率的权衡，实现高接受率和低开销的推测解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推测解码方法在增加草稿大小时会提高接受率但引入额外延迟，存在速度-准确性的权衡限制。现有方法要么降低接受率，要么引入限制扩展的开销。

Method: 使用分支完整展开从早期退出信号并行启动，在异构加速器（GPU和NPU）上显式映射计算以利用跨设备并行性。草稿推测目标模型的后续延续，同时目标模型推测草稿的修正路径，形成两个互补的执行流水线。添加推测流式处理使草稿每步生成多个令牌。

Result: 在SpecBench上使用14B到66B参数的服务器规模模型，Mirror-SD实现2.8x-5.8x的端到端加速，相比最强基线EAGLE3平均相对提升30%。

Conclusion: Mirror-SD通过并行异构执行和多令牌推测流式处理的双重策略，将推测解码推向高接受率低开销的理想状态，在各种任务中实现一致的性能提升。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by using a draft model to look
ahead, but gains are capped by the cost of autoregressive draft generation:
increasing draft size elevates acceptance rates but introduces additional
latency overhead exacerbating the speed-accuracy tradeoff. Prior methods
(Medusa, Hydra, EAGLE) partially reduce draft cost but either degrade
acceptance or introduce overheads that limit scaling. We present Mirror
Speculative Decoding (Mirror-SD), an inference algorithm that breaks the
latency-acceptance tradeoff. Mirror-SD launches branch-complete rollouts from
early-exit signals in parallel with the target model's suffix and explicitly
maps computation across heterogeneous accelerators (GPU and NPU) to exploit
cross-device parallelism. The draft speculates forward continuations for the
target to verify, while the target simultaneously speculates correction paths
for the draft, converting speculation into two complementary execution
pipelines. To further cut draft latency without weakening acceptance semantics,
we add speculative streaming so the draft emits multiple tokens per step. This
dual strategy of parallel heterogeneous execution plus multi-token speculative
streaming pushes speculative decoding toward its ideal regime of high
acceptance with low overhead. On SpecBench with server-scale models from 14B to
66B parameters, Mirror-SD delivers consistent end-to-end gains, achieving
2.8x-5.8x wall-time speedups across diverse tasks and a 30% average relative
improvement over the strongest baseline, EAGLE3.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出并评估了用于图结构抽象代码生成的JSON表示方法，证明LLM能够在单次推理中完成图结构代码生成，且不同表示方法对准确率有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM擅长生成原始顺序代码，但在图结构抽象代码生成方面研究较少，这种能力对可视化编程语言和无法访问源代码的场景很重要。

Method: 提出JSON图表示方法，在基于Scratch的Python重实现基准ScratchTest上评估LLM的图结构代码生成能力。

Result: LLM能够在单次推理中完成图结构抽象代码生成，不同表示方法导致准确率显著差异，证明了表示方法在此任务中的关键作用。

Conclusion: 这项工作为图结构抽象代码生成的表示学习奠定了基础，证明了正确图表示对LLM性能的重要性。

Abstract: Most large language models (LLMs) today excel at generating raw, sequential
code with minimal abstractions and custom structures. However, there has been
little work on graph-based abstract code generation, where significant logic is
encapsulated in predefined nodes and execution flow is determined by edges.
This is relevant for visual programming languages, and in cases where raw
source code is inaccessible to users and LLM training sets. In this work, we
propose and evaluate JSON representations for graphs to enable high accuracy
graph-based abstract code generation. We evaluate these representations on
ScratchTest, a mini-benchmark based on our custom Python re-implementation of
Scratch, which tests the LLM in code graph space. Our findings demonstrate that
LLMs can indeed perform the aforementioned generation task in a single pass
without relying on specialized or complex pipelines, given the correct graph
representations. We also show that different representations induce
significantly different accuracies, highlighting the instrumental role of
representations in this generation task. All in all, this work establishes the
first steps towards representation learning for graph-based abstract code
generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统思维链蒸馏在科学领域效果不佳，因为即使是先进大模型也常产生错误或肤浅的推理，直接蒸馏会导致低质量训练数据，限制学生模型的性能。

Method: 构建多样化推理轨迹池，自动检索领域知识进行增强，通过新颖性驱动选择、反思性重组和变异进行迭代优化，使用评估答案正确性、连贯性和知识利用效率的适应度函数指导。

Result: 生成的进化数据集用于微调紧凑模型，在科学推理基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该工作建立了一种从多样且易出错的大模型中合成高保真科学推理数据的可扩展方法。

Abstract: While chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation from advanced large language models
(LLMs) has proven effective in general reasoning tasks, it struggles in
scientific domains where even advanced models often produce incorrect or
superficial reasoning due to high complexity and specialized knowledge
requirements. Directly distilling from such flawed outputs results in
low-quality training data and limits the performance of smaller student models.
To overcome this, we propose CoT-Evo, an evolutionary CoT distillation
framework. It begins by constructing a diverse pool of reasoning trajectories
from multiple LLM thinkers, enriches them with automatically retrieved domain
knowledge, and iteratively refines the trajectories using novelty-driven
selection, reflective recombination and mutation. The refinement is guided by a
fitness function that evaluates answer correctness, coherence, and effective
knowledge utilization. This results in a high-quality CoT dataset tailored for
scientific reasoning. We employ this evolved dataset to fine-tune a compact
model, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on scientific reasoning
benchmarks. Our work establishes a scalable approach to synthesizing
high-fidelity scientific reasoning data from diverse and fallible LLMs.

Motivation: 现有关于思维链微调的调查主要关注技术层面，忽视了从人类推理机制角度的系统分析。鉴于CoT微调的最终目标是让大语言模型像人类一样推理，从人类认知角度研究这一技术至关重要。

Method: 受著名的六顶思考帽框架启发，该框架使用六个隐喻帽子系统地表征常见的人类思维模式，作者通过这一视角对CoT微调方法进行分类和检验。

Result: 构建了现有数据集和模型性能的全面概述，并维护了一个实时GitHub仓库持续跟踪该领域的最新进展。

Conclusion: 这项调查有望成为有价值的资源，激发这一快速发展领域的创新和进步。

Abstract: Chain of thought (CoT) fine-tuning aims to endow large language models (LLMs)
with reasoning capabilities by training them on curated reasoning traces. It
leverages both supervised and reinforced fine-tuning to cultivate human-like
reasoning skills in LLMs, including detailed planning, divergent thinking,
intuitive judgment, timely reflection, internal thinking, and fact perception,
etc. As CoT fine-tuning has advanced, LLMs have demonstrated substantial
improvements in tasks such as mathematical reasoning and code generation.
However, existing surveys about CoT fine-tuning primarily focus on technical
aspects and overlook a systematic analysis from the perspective of human
reasoning mechanisms. Given that the ultimate goal of CoT fine-tuning is to
enable LLMs to reason like humans, it is crucial to investigate this technique
through the lens of human cognition. To fill this gap, we present the first
comprehensive survey of CoT fine-tuning grounded in human reasoning theory.
Specifically, inspired by the well-known Six Thinking Hats framework, which
systematically characterizes common human thinking modes using six metaphorical
hats, we classify and examine CoT fine-tuning methods through this lens.
Furthermore, building upon this theory, we outline potential directions for
future research in CoT fine-tuning. In addition, we compile a comprehensive
overview of existing datasets and model performances, and a real-time GitHub
repository \footnote{https://github.com/AI-Chen/Awesome-CoT-Finetuning} that
continuously tracks recent advances in this area is maintained. We hope this
survey will serve as a valuable resource to inspire innovation and foster
progress in this rapidly evolving field.

TL;DR: 提出DSCD方法，通过自约束解码实现LLM去毒，无需参数微调，在保持生成流畅性的同时有效降低毒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解码去毒方法依赖外部约束，导致资源开销增加且损失生成流畅性

Method: 在输出生成过程中加强安全层的内部下一词分布，同时削弱幻觉和毒性层的分布

Result: 在开源LLM和公共数据集上的广泛实验验证了DSCD的有效性，在去毒和生成流畅性方面达到SOTA性能，效率优于现有方法

Conclusion: DSCD具有轻量、高兼容性和即插即用特性，为更安全的LLM部署提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Detoxification in large language models (LLMs) remains a significant research
challenge. Existing decoding detoxification methods are all based on external
constraints, which require additional resource overhead and lose generation
fluency. This work proposes Detoxification with Self-Constrained Decoding
(DSCD), a novel method for LLM detoxification without parameter fine-tuning.
DSCD strengthens the inner next-token distribution of the safety layer while
weakening that of hallucination and toxic layers during output generation. This
effectively diminishes toxicity and enhances output safety. DSCD offers
lightweight, high compatibility, and plug-and-play capabilities, readily
integrating with existing detoxification methods for further performance
improvement. Extensive experiments on representative open-source LLMs and
public datasets validate DSCD's effectiveness, demonstrating state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance in both detoxification and generation fluency, with superior
efficiency compared to existing methods. These results highlight DSCD's
potential as a practical and scalable solution for safer LLM deployments.

TL;DR: SHIELD是一个轻量级、模型无关的预处理框架，通过细粒度安全分类和类别特定指导来防御LVLMs中的对抗性输入攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型虽然具备强大的多模态推理能力，但也扩大了攻击面，特别是通过良性提示中隐藏有害目标的对抗性输入。

Method: SHIELD结合细粒度安全分类与类别特定指导，使用明确的行动（阻止、重构、转发），无需重新训练即可生成定制的安全提示。

Result: 在五个基准测试和五个代表性LVLMs上，SHIELD持续降低越狱和不遵循率，同时保持实用性。

Conclusion: SHIELD是一个即插即用的实用安全补丁，开销极小，易于扩展到新的攻击类型，适用于弱对齐和强对齐的LVLMs。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) unlock powerful multimodal reasoning but
also expand the attack surface, particularly through adversarial inputs that
conceal harmful goals in benign prompts. We propose SHIELD, a lightweight,
model-agnostic preprocessing framework that couples fine-grained safety
classification with category-specific guidance and explicit actions (Block,
Reframe, Forward). Unlike binary moderators, SHIELD composes tailored safety
prompts that enforce nuanced refusals or safe redirection without retraining.
Across five benchmarks and five representative LVLMs, SHIELD consistently
lowers jailbreak and non-following rates while preserving utility. Our method
is plug-and-play, incurs negligible overhead, and is easily extendable to new
attack types -- serving as a practical safety patch for both weakly and
strongly aligned LVLMs.

TL;DR: 论文研究发现检索增强生成(RAG)中上下文格式对性能有显著影响，提出了上下文归一化策略来提升鲁棒性和长上下文利用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG研究主要关注检索质量和提示策略，但检索文档的格式化方式(如分隔符、结构标记)对性能的影响尚未充分探索。

Method: 设计控制实验改变上下文密度、分隔符样式和位置放置，提出上下文归一化策略来自适应标准化上下文表示。

Result: 实验表明上下文格式的微小变化会导致准确性和稳定性的显著差异，提出的归一化策略在各种RAG基准测试中都能提升鲁棒性和长上下文利用能力。

Conclusion: 可靠的RAG不仅依赖于检索正确内容，还取决于内容的呈现方式，这为长上下文推理提供了新的实证证据和实用技术。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become an essential approach for
extending the reasoning and knowledge capacity of large language models (LLMs).
While prior research has primarily focused on retrieval quality and prompting
strategies, the influence of how the retrieved documents are framed, i.e.,
context format, remains underexplored. We show that seemingly superficial
choices, such as delimiters or structural markers in key-value extraction, can
induce substantial shifts in accuracy and stability, even when semantic content
is identical. To systematically investigate this effect, we design controlled
experiments that vary context density, delimiter styles, and positional
placement, revealing the underlying factors that govern performance
differences. Building on these insights, we introduce Contextual Normalization,
a lightweight strategy that adaptively standardizes context representations
before generation. Extensive experiments on both controlled and real-world RAG
benchmarks across diverse settings demonstrate that the proposed strategy
consistently improves robustness to order variation and strengthens
long-context utilization. These findings underscore that reliable RAG depends
not only on retrieving the right content, but also on how that content is
presented, offering both new empirical evidence and a practical technique for
better long-context reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音翻译系统忽略了重音等韵律特征，导致翻译结果缺乏情感表达和说话者意图，需要开发能够保持词级重音的翻译方法。

Method: 利用LLM进行跨语言重音转换，将源语言重音映射为目标语言标签，指导可控TTS模型生成。为解决数据稀缺问题，开发了自动生成对齐训练数据的流水线，并引入"LLM-as-Judge"评估方法。

Result: 实验表明该方法在保持重音方面显著优于基线模型，同时保持了可比的翻译质量、说话者意图和自然度。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了韵律在翻译中的重要性，为S2ST中副语言线索的保持提供了一种有效且数据高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a stress-aware speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) system that
preserves word-level emphasis by leveraging LLMs for cross-lingual emphasis
conversion. Our method translates source-language stress into target-language
tags that guide a controllable TTS model. To overcome data scarcity, we
developed a pipeline to automatically generate aligned training data and
introduce the "LLM-as-Judge" for evaluation. Experiments show our approach
substantially outperforms baselines in preserving emphasis while maintaining
comparable translation quality, speaker intent, and naturalness. Our work
highlights the importance of prosody in translation and provides an effective,
data-efficient solution for preserving paralinguistic cues in S2ST.

Motivation: 解决基于预训练大语言模型的文本异常检测方法中高维密集嵌入带来的内存需求大和计算时间长的问题。

Method: 使用简化隔离核(SIK)将高维密集嵌入映射到低维稀疏表示，通过边界聚焦特征映射保持异常特征，具有线性时间复杂度。

Result: 在7个数据集上的实验表明，SIK在检测性能上优于11种最先进的异常检测算法，同时保持计算效率和低内存成本。

Conclusion: SIK是一种高效且有效的文本异常检测方法，能够在降低计算和内存成本的同时保持优异的检测性能。

Abstract: Two-step approaches combining pre-trained large language model embeddings and
anomaly detectors demonstrate strong performance in text anomaly detection by
leveraging rich semantic representations. However, high-dimensional dense
embeddings extracted by large language models pose challenges due to
substantial memory requirements and high computation time. To address this
challenge, we introduce the Simplified Isolation Kernel (SIK), which maps
high-dimensional dense embeddings to lower-dimensional sparse representations
while preserving crucial anomaly characteristics. SIK has linear time
complexity and significantly reduces space complexity through its innovative
boundary-focused feature mapping. Experiments across 7 datasets demonstrate
that SIK achieves better detection performance than 11 state-of-the-art (SOTA)
anomaly detection algorithms while maintaining computational efficiency and low
memory cost. All code and demonstrations are available at

TL;DR: 提出LLM引导的合成增强方法(LGSA)，使用大语言模型为代表性不足群体生成反事实示例，在保持标签完整性的同时减少AI系统的性能差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI系统中由自然语言数据引起的偏见问题，传统公平方法依赖受保护属性标签、存在准确性与公平性权衡、且难以跨数据集泛化。

Method: 使用结构化提示生成性别交换的释义，通过语义相似性检查、属性验证、毒性筛选和人工抽查进行质量控制，扩展训练数据集覆盖范围。

Result: LGSA将性别偏见差距从7.2%降至1.9%，准确率从96.7%提升至99.1%，改善了女性标签示例的性能表现。

Conclusion: LGSA是一种有效的偏见缓解策略，能在保持高任务准确性和标签保真度的同时增强子群体平衡。

Abstract: Bias in AI systems, especially those relying on natural language data, raises
ethical and practical concerns. Underrepresentation of certain groups often
leads to uneven performance across demographics. Traditional fairness methods,
such as pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing, depend on
protected-attribute labels, involve accuracy-fairness trade-offs, and may not
generalize across datasets. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-Guided
Synthetic Augmentation (LGSA), which uses large language models to generate
counterfactual examples for underrepresented groups while preserving label
integrity. We evaluated LGSA on a controlled dataset of short English sentences
with gendered pronouns, professions, and binary classification labels.
Structured prompts were used to produce gender-swapped paraphrases, followed by
quality control including semantic similarity checks, attribute verification,
toxicity screening, and human spot checks. The augmented dataset expanded
training coverage and was used to train a classifier under consistent
conditions. Results show that LGSA reduces performance disparities without
compromising accuracy. The baseline model achieved 96.7 percent accuracy with a
7.2 percent gender bias gap. Simple swap augmentation reduced the gap to 0.7
percent but lowered accuracy to 95.6 percent. LGSA achieved 99.1 percent
accuracy with a 1.9 percent bias gap, improving performance on female-labeled
examples. These findings demonstrate that LGSA is an effective strategy for
bias mitigation, enhancing subgroup balance while maintaining high task
accuracy and label fidelity.

Motivation: 探究LLMs展现的人类水平语言能力是否源于与人类大脑相似的机制，以及这些模型如何处理句法结构。

Method: 使用分层频率标记探针(HFTP)进行频域分析，识别LLMs中的神经元组件(如MLP神经元)和大脑皮层区域(通过颅内记录)中编码句法结构的部分。

Result: GPT-2、Gemma、Gemma 2、Llama 2、Llama 3.1和GLM-4在相似层处理句法，而人脑依赖不同皮层区域处理不同句法层次。LLM表征与大脑左半球(主导语言处理)更一致。模型升级趋势不一：Gemma 2比Gemma更接近大脑，而Llama 3.1比Llama 2更偏离大脑。

Conclusion: HFTP是连接计算语言学和认知神经科学的有价值工具，为LLM行为改进的可解释性提供新见解，引发这些进步是否由类人或非类人机制驱动的思考。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate human-level or even superior
language abilities, effectively modeling syntactic structures, yet the specific
computational modules responsible remain unclear. A key question is whether LLM
behavioral capabilities stem from mechanisms akin to those in the human brain.
To address these questions, we introduce the Hierarchical Frequency Tagging
Probe (HFTP), a tool that utilizes frequency-domain analysis to identify
neuron-wise components of LLMs (e.g., individual Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
neurons) and cortical regions (via intracranial recordings) encoding syntactic
structures. Our results show that models such as GPT-2, Gemma, Gemma 2, Llama
2, Llama 3.1, and GLM-4 process syntax in analogous layers, while the human
brain relies on distinct cortical regions for different syntactic levels.
Representational similarity analysis reveals a stronger alignment between LLM
representations and the left hemisphere of the brain (dominant in language
processing). Notably, upgraded models exhibit divergent trends: Gemma 2 shows
greater brain similarity than Gemma, while Llama 3.1 shows less alignment with
the brain compared to Llama 2. These findings offer new insights into the
interpretability of LLM behavioral improvements, raising questions about
whether these advancements are driven by human-like or non-human-like
mechanisms, and establish HFTP as a valuable tool bridging computational
linguistics and cognitive neuroscience. This project is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了Concept游戏作为评估LLMs溯因推理能力的基准，发现人类能轻松解决（成功率>90%），但最先进的LLMs表现很差（成功率<40%），特别是在理解玩家战略意图和根据序列信息更新修正假设方面存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLMs虽然在许多基准测试中表现出色，但在需要抽象推理的任务上仍有根本性弱点，特别是当任务涉及与自然语言训练数据不同的表示形式（如网格、符号或视觉模式）时。

Method: 引入Concept单词猜测棋盘游戏作为基准，该游戏使用更接近LLM预训练数据的自然语言表示，评估LLMs在多种语言（英语、荷兰语、法语、西班牙语）中的溯因推理能力。

Result: 人类成功率超过90%，而最先进的LLMs成功率不超过40%；LLMs在理解玩家战略意图和根据序列信息更新修正假设方面表现不佳；在低资源语言中LLM性能进一步下降。

Conclusion: Concept游戏有效暴露了LLMs在溯因推理方面的核心弱点，特别是在战略意图理解和动态信息更新处理方面，且这种弱点在低资源语言中更为明显。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved striking successes on many
benchmarks, yet recent studies continue to expose fundamental weaknesses. In
particular, tasks that require abstract reasoning remain challenging, often
because they use representations such as grids, symbols, or visual patterns
that differ from the natural language data LLMs are trained on. In this paper,
we introduce Concept, a simple word-guessing board game, as a benchmark for
probing abductive reasoning in a representation that is much closer to LLM
pre-training data: natural language. Our results show that this game, easily
solved by humans (with a success rate of over 90\%), is still very challenging
for state-of-the-art LLMs (no model exceeds 40\% success rate). Specifically,
we observe that LLMs struggle with interpreting other players' strategic
intents, and with correcting initial hypotheses given sequential information
updates. In addition, we extend the evaluation across multiple languages, and
find that the LLM performance drops further in lower-resource languages (Dutch,
French, and Spanish) compared to English.

Conclusion: VERITAS能够有效提升搜索代理的推理忠实度，为解决思维链不忠实问题提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Inspired by the success of reinforcement learning (RL) in Large Language
Model (LLM) training for domains like math and code, recent works have begun
exploring how to train LLMs to use search engines more effectively as tools for
retrieval-augmented generation. Although these methods achieve performance
improvement across QA benchmarks, many prioritize final answer correctness
while overlooking the quality of intermediate reasoning steps, which may lead
to chain-of-thought unfaithfulness. In this paper, we first introduce a
comprehensive evaluation framework for evaluating RL-based search agents,
covering three distinct faithfulness metrics: information-think faithfulness,
think-answer faithfulness, and think-search faithfulness. Our evaluations
reveal that a prototypical RL-based search agent, Search-R1, has significant
room for improvement in this regard. To foster faithful reasoning, we introduce
VERITAS (Verifying Entailed Reasoning through Intermediate Traceability in
Agentic Search), a novel framework that integrates fine-grained faithfulness
rewards into the reinforcement learning process. Our experiments show that
models trained with VERITAS not only significantly improve reasoning
faithfulness, but also achieve comparable task performance across seven QA
benchmarks.

Method: IDS方法根据输入在表示空间中的数据分布动态调整干预强度，当输入远离分布时加强干预，靠近分布时减弱干预，实现自适应控制。

Result: 实验表明IDS在分类任务上达到高准确率，同时生成连贯文本且避免崩溃，特别适合实际应用场景。

Conclusion: IDS通过自适应干预强度解决了传统激活引导方法的局限性，在保持文本质量的同时实现有效控制，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Activation steering methods control large language model (LLM) behavior by
modifying internal activations at inference time. However, most existing
activation steering methods rely on a fixed steering strength, leading to
either insufficient control or unadapted intervention that degrades text
plausibility and coherence. We introduce In-Distribution Steering (IDS), a
novel method that adapts steering strength based on the input data distribution
in representation space. IDS dynamically adjusts interventions according to how
far a given input lies within the distribution, enabling adaptive intervention
and generation stability during text generation. Experiments demonstrate that
IDS achieves strong accuracy on classification tasks while producing coherent
text without collapse, making IDS particularly well suited for real-world
applications.

Abstract: Enhancing customer experience is essential for business success, particularly
as service demands grow in scale and complexity. Generative artificial
intelligence and Large Language Models (LLMs) have empowered intelligent
interaction systems to deliver efficient, personalized, and 24/7 support. In
practice, intelligent interaction systems encounter several challenges: (1)
Constructing high-quality data for cold-start training is difficult, hindering
self-evolution and raising labor costs. (2) Multi-turn dialogue performance
remains suboptimal due to inadequate intent understanding, rule compliance, and
solution extraction. (3) Frequent evolution of business rules affects system
operability and transferability, constraining low-cost expansion and
adaptability. (4) Reliance on a single LLM is insufficient in complex
scenarios, where the absence of multi-agent frameworks and effective
collaboration undermines process completeness and service quality. (5) The
open-domain nature of multi-turn dialogues, lacking unified golden answers,
hampers quantitative evaluation and continuous optimization. To address these
challenges, we introduce WOWService, an intelligent interaction system tailored
for industrial applications. With the integration of LLMs and multi-agent
architectures, WOWService enables autonomous task management and collaborative
problem-solving. Specifically, WOWService focuses on core modules including
data construction, general capability enhancement, business scenario
adaptation, multi-agent coordination, and automated evaluation. Currently,
WOWService is deployed on the Meituan App, achieving significant gains in key
metrics, e.g., User Satisfaction Metric 1 (USM 1) -27.53% and User Satisfaction
Metric 2 (USM 2) +25.51%, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing user
needs and advancing personalized service.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自适应分类器自由引导方案，用于解决自回归TTS模型中情感提示与文本语义内容不匹配的问题，通过根据检测到的不匹配程度调整CFG参数，在保持音频质量和可懂度的同时提升情感表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当TTS系统中期望的情感表达与文本语义内容不匹配时，会导致语音听起来不自然，这一问题在自回归TTS模型中尤为突出，而现有的分类器自由引导技术在此类模型中的应用研究不足。

Method: 提出自适应CFG方案，使用大语言模型或自然语言推理模型检测风格-内容不匹配程度，并根据不同不匹配水平动态调整CFG参数。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的自适应CFG方案在保持音频质量和可懂度的同时，显著提升了自回归TTS模型的情感表达能力。

Conclusion: 自适应CFG方案有效解决了自回归TTS模型中的风格-内容不匹配问题，为实现细粒度情感控制提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: While Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems can achieve fine-grained control over
emotional expression via natural language prompts, a significant challenge
emerges when the desired emotion (style prompt) conflicts with the semantic
content of the text. This mismatch often results in unnatural-sounding speech,
undermining the goal of achieving fine-grained emotional control.
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a key technique for enhancing prompt
alignment; however, its application to auto-regressive (AR) TTS models remains
underexplored, which can lead to degraded audio quality. This paper directly
addresses the challenge of style-content mismatch in AR TTS models by proposing
an adaptive CFG scheme that adjusts to different levels of the detected
mismatch, as measured using large language models or natural language inference
models. This solution is based on a comprehensive analysis of CFG's impact on
emotional expressiveness in state-of-the-art AR TTS models. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed adaptive CFG scheme improves the emotional
expressiveness of the AR TTS model while maintaining audio quality and
intelligibility.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM预训练和上下文学习能力的无监督方法，使用LLM的对数概率来测量文本间的风格可转移性，在控制主题相关性时优于对比训练基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算风格学分析文本中的量化模式，但监督和对比方法依赖具有虚假相关性的数据，经常混淆风格与主题。现代LLM的CLM预训练在通用作者身份问题中很少被利用。

Method: 利用LLM的广泛预训练和上下文学习能力，通过LLM的对数概率来测量从一个文本到另一个文本的风格可转移性。

Result: 该方法显著优于同等规模的LLM提示方法，在控制主题相关性时比对比训练基线获得更高准确率。性能与基础模型大小一致扩展，在作者身份验证中通过增加测试时计算实现计算成本与准确性的灵活权衡。

Conclusion: 基于LLM预训练的无监督方法在风格分析中有效区分风格与主题，性能可扩展且计算成本可控。

Abstract: Computational stylometry analyzes writing style through quantitative patterns
in text, supporting applications from forensic tasks such as identity linking
and plagiarism detection to literary attribution in the humanities. Supervised
and contrastive approaches rely on data with spurious correlations and often
confuse style with topic. Despite their natural use in AI-generated text
detection, the CLM pre-training of modern LLMs has been scarcely leveraged for
general authorship problems. We propose a novel unsupervised approach based on
this extensive pre-training and the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs,
employing the log-probabilities of an LLM to measure style transferability from
one text to another. Our method significantly outperforms LLM prompting
approaches of comparable scale and achieves higher accuracy than contrastively
trained baselines when controlling for topical correlations. Moreover,
performance scales fairly consistently with the size of the base model and, in
the case of authorship verification, with an additional mechanism that
increases test-time computation; enabling flexible trade-offs between
computational cost and accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChatR1是一个基于强化学习的对话问答推理框架，通过交错搜索和推理来适应动态对话需求，使用意图感知奖励解决稀疏奖励问题，在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话问答中用户意图会随着对话轮次演变，话语通常不完整，需要上下文解释、查询重构以及检索与生成的动态协调，而静态的重写-检索-生成流程无法满足这些需求。

Method: 基于强化学习的推理框架，交错进行搜索和推理，提出意图感知奖励机制提供轮次级反馈，使检索和推理与用户目标对齐。

Result: 在3B和7B模型骨干上均表现强劲，在五个CQA数据集上优于竞争模型，消融研究证实了意图感知奖励的有效性，分析显示多样化的推理轨迹和有效的搜索工具使用。

Conclusion: 基于强化学习的推理比静态CQA流程实现了更灵活和上下文敏感的行为，能够稳健地跨领域泛化。

Abstract: We present ChatR1, a reasoning framework based on reinforcement learning (RL)
for conversational question answering (CQA). Reasoning plays an important role
in CQA, where user intent evolves across dialogue turns, and utterances are
often underspecified, requiring contextual interpretation, query reformulation,
and dynamic coordination between retrieval and generation. Unlike static
`rewrite, retrieve, and generate' pipelines, ChatR1 interleaves search and
reasoning across turns, enabling exploratory and adaptive behaviors learned
through RL. To address the challenge of sparse and delayed rewards in RL, we
propose an intent-aware reward that provides turn-level feedback by aligning
retrieval and reasoning with evolving user goals. Our proposed ChatR1
demonstrates strong performance on both 3B and 7B model backbones,
outperforming competitive models on five CQA datasets, measured by different
metrics (F1, BERTScore, and LLM-as-judge). We include a diverse set of CQA
datasets to cover topic shifts, evolving intents, mixed-initiative dialogues,
and multi-document grounding, testing ChatR1's performance from various
aspects. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the intent-aware reward.
Our analyses further reveal diverse reasoning trajectories and effective use of
the search tool. ChatR1 also generalizes robustly across domains, demonstrating
that RL-based reasoning enables more flexible and context-sensitive behavior
than static CQA pipelines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了EBCAR，一种轻量级的重排序框架，通过增强跨段落理解来解决RAG系统中需要跨段落推理的检索挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG系统将长文档分割成短段落进行检索，但当需要跨段落推理（如解决指代、消歧实体、聚合证据）时面临挑战，现有重排序方法忽视了这些问题。

Method: EBCAR直接在检索段落的嵌入上操作，通过段落结构信息和混合注意力机制增强跨段落理解，同时捕获文档间高层交互和文档内低层关系。

Result: 在ConTEB基准测试中，EBCAR在需要跨段落推理的信息检索任务上表现出色，在准确性和效率方面均有优势。

Conclusion: EBCAR是一个有效的轻量级重排序框架，特别适用于需要跨段落推理的检索任务，在准确性和效率方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely on retrieving relevant
evidence from a corpus to support downstream generation. The common practice of
splitting a long document into multiple shorter passages enables finer-grained
and targeted information retrieval. However, it also introduces challenges when
a correct retrieval would require inference across passages, such as resolving
coreference, disambiguating entities, and aggregating evidence scattered across
multiple sources. Many state-of-the-art (SOTA) reranking methods, despite
utilizing powerful large pretrained language models with potentially high
inference costs, still neglect the aforementioned challenges. Therefore, we
propose Embedding-Based Context-Aware Reranker (EBCAR), a lightweight reranking
framework operating directly on embeddings of retrieved passages with enhanced
cross-passage understandings through the structural information of the passages
and a hybrid attention mechanism, which captures both high-level interactions
across documents and low-level relationships within each document. We evaluate
EBCAR against SOTA rerankers on the ConTEB benchmark, demonstrating its
effectiveness for information retrieval requiring cross-passage inference and
its advantages in both accuracy and efficiency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DefensiveKV和Layer-DefensiveKV方法，通过防御性聚合策略来优化Transformer的KV缓存管理，在极端情况下保护生成质量，显著减少缓存大小对性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存逐出方法基于稳定性假设，但该假设本质脆弱，均值聚合在极端情况下容易失效，导致生成质量下降。

Method: 采用两步线性时间防御性聚合策略控制最坏情况风险，提出DefensiveKV及其扩展Layer-DefensiveKV，包含分层预算分配机制。

Result: 在7个任务领域（18个数据集）上，相比最强基线，在20%缓存大小下分别减少2.3倍和4.3倍的生成质量损失。

Conclusion: 该方法为通过最坏情况风险管理优化缓存逐出开辟了有前景的方向，建立了新的性能基准。

Abstract: Large language models have revolutionized natural language processing, yet
their deployment remains hampered by the substantial memory and runtime
overhead of the transformer's Key-Value cache. To mitigate this, recent methods
employ a scoring-aggregation framework to evict unimportant cache entries,
based on the stability assumption-that a fixed subset of entries remains
consistently important during generation. However, prior work has largely
focused on refining importance indicators for scoring, while defaulting to mean
aggregation due to a faithful trust in the stability assumption. In this work,
we argue that this underlying assumption is inherently fragile, making mean
aggregation highly vulnerable in extreme cases. To counter this, we propose a
simple yet elegant defensive aggregation strategy: a two-step, linear-time
approach that controls worst-case risk, thereby defending against extreme cases
with negligible computational overhead. Embodying this strategy, we propose a
novel cache eviction method, DefensiveKV and its extension, Layer-DefensiveKV,
which incorporates layer-wise budget allocation. Across seven task domains (18
datasets), our methods reduce generation quality loss by 2.3x and 4.3x
respectively, versus the strongest baseline under a 20% cache size. These
results set new performance benchmarks and pioneer a promising direction for
optimizing cache eviction against underlying fragility through worst-case risk
management. Our code is available at https://github.com/FFY0/DefensiveKV.

TL;DR: 利用NLP技术分析希腊谚语情感分布，通过LLM进行情感分类并绘制希腊各地区情感分布图，发现负面情感在大多数地区更为普遍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索全球谚语景观，特别是希腊谚语的情感特征，利用NLP技术分析传统智慧的口头传承现象

Method: 使用LLM进行谚语情感分类，扩展带注释的希腊谚语数据集以包含方言，结合地理位置、方言和主题进行组合分析

Result: LLM能够准确识别谚语情感，特别是在非传统情感极性任务中表现良好；希腊大多数地区负面情感更为普遍

Conclusion: LLM为谚语情感分析提供了有效工具，揭示了希腊谚语情感分布的地域特征

Abstract: Proverbs are among the most fascinating linguistic phenomena that transcend
cultural and linguistic boundaries. Yet, much of the global landscape of
proverbs remains underexplored, as many cultures preserve their traditional
wisdom within their own communities due to the oral tradition of the
phenomenon. Taking advantage of the current advances in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), we focus on Greek proverbs, analyzing their sentiment.
Departing from an annotated dataset of Greek proverbs, we expand it to include
local dialects, effectively mapping the annotated sentiment. We present (1) a
way to exploit LLMs in order to perform sentiment classification of proverbs,
(2) a map of Greece that provides an overview of the distribution of sentiment,
(3) a combinatory analysis in terms of the geographic position, dialect, and
topic of proverbs. Our findings show that LLMs can provide us with an accurate
enough picture of the sentiment of proverbs, especially when approached as a
non-conventional sentiment polarity task. Moreover, in most areas of Greece
negative sentiment is more prevalent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在企业关键领域的部署增加，现有护栏系统在实时监督、多模态数据处理和可解释性方面存在不足，无法满足受监管环境的需求。

Method: 采用基于LoRA的微调特定类别适配器，在广泛的多模态数据集上训练，通过教师辅助标注管道生成高质量、上下文感知的标签。

Result: 实验结果显示在所有安全维度上均达到最先进性能，超越了WildGuard、LlamaGuard-4和GPT-4.1等现有模型。

Conclusion: Protect为可信、可审计且生产就绪的安全系统奠定了坚实基础，能够跨文本、图像和音频模态运行。

Abstract: The increasing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) across enterprise
and mission-critical domains has underscored the urgent need for robust
guardrailing systems that ensure safety, reliability, and compliance. Existing
solutions often struggle with real-time oversight, multi-modal data handling,
and explainability -- limitations that hinder their adoption in regulated
environments. Existing guardrails largely operate in isolation, focused on text
alone making them inadequate for multi-modal, production-scale environments. We
introduce Protect, natively multi-modal guardrailing model designed to operate
seamlessly across text, image, and audio inputs, designed for enterprise-grade
deployment. Protect integrates fine-tuned, category-specific adapters trained
via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on an extensive, multi-modal dataset covering
four safety dimensions: toxicity, sexism, data privacy, and prompt injection.
Our teacher-assisted annotation pipeline leverages reasoning and explanation
traces to generate high-fidelity, context-aware labels across modalities.
Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all safety
dimensions, surpassing existing open and proprietary models such as WildGuard,
LlamaGuard-4, and GPT-4.1. Protect establishes a strong foundation for
trustworthy, auditable, and production-ready safety systems capable of
operating across text, image, and audio modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究联邦学习环境中ASR模型的隐私保护能力，探索仅通过权重差异就能推断敏感属性的攻击可能性。

Method: 采用非参数白盒攻击方法，在被动威胁模型下测试Wav2Vec2、HuBERT和Whisper三种ASR模型，攻击仅基于权重差异而不需要原始语音数据。

Result: 证明了可以从所有模型中可靠推断口音信息，性别、年龄、情感和构音障碍等敏感属性也存在被推断的风险，预训练数据中代表性不足的属性更易受攻击。

Conclusion: 揭示了联邦ASR模型中先前未记录的漏洞，为改进安全性提供了见解，表明仅依赖联邦学习可能不足以保护敏感属性隐私。

Abstract: Federated learning is a common method for privacy-preserving training of
machine learning models. In this paper, we analyze the vulnerability of ASR
models to attribute inference attacks in the federated setting. We test a
non-parametric white-box attack method under a passive threat model on three
ASR models: Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, and Whisper. The attack operates solely on weight
differentials without access to raw speech from target speakers. We demonstrate
attack feasibility on sensitive demographic and clinical attributes: gender,
age, accent, emotion, and dysarthria. Our findings indicate that attributes
that are underrepresented or absent in the pre-training data are more
vulnerable to such inference attacks. In particular, information about accents
can be reliably inferred from all models. Our findings expose previously
undocumented vulnerabilities in federated ASR models and offer insights towards
improved security.

*Xiang Lei,Qin Li,Min Zhang,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: D-SMART是一个模型无关框架，通过动态结构化记忆和推理树来维护多轮对话的事实和逻辑一致性，显著提升对话质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在扩展多轮对话中经常出现事实不一致和逻辑衰退问题，主要原因是依赖静态预训练知识且无法对对话历史进行自适应推理。现有的RAG和工作记忆方法虽然改善了信息召回，但仍基于静态知识源和单一推理路径。

Method: 提出D-SMART框架，包含两个协同组件：(1)动态结构化记忆(DSM)，增量构建和维护符合OWL标准的对话知识图谱；(2)推理树(RT)，在图谱上执行显式、可追踪的多步推理搜索。

Result: 在MT-Bench-101基准测试中，D-SMART显著优于现有最优方法，将对话一致性分数提升了48%以上，并将开源模型的质量分数提升了10.1%。

Conclusion: D-SMART通过动态结构化记忆和显式推理机制，有效解决了LLMs在多轮对话中的一致性问题，为构建更可靠的对话系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit factual inconsistencies and
logical decay in extended, multi-turn dialogues, a challenge stemming from
their reliance on static, pre-trained knowledge and an inability to reason
adaptively over the dialogue history. Prevailing mitigation strategies, such as
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and agentic working memories, improve
information recall but still engage with fundamentally static knowledge sources
and follow pre-defined single reasoning path. This hinders their ability to
preserve factual and logical consistency of their responses in multi-turn
dialogues while the context evolves over time. To address this issue, we
propose D-SMART, a model-agnostic framework designed to maintain multi-turn
dialogue consistency by enabling LLMs to build and reason over a dynamic,
structured representation of the conversational context. This is achieved via
two synergistic components: (1) a Dynamic Structured Memory (DSM), which
incrementally constructs and maintains an authoritative, OWL-compliant
knowledge graph of the conversation; and (2) a Reasoning Tree (RT), which
executes inferences as an explicit and traceable multi-step search over the
graph. As the popular-used quality score (judged by GPT-4) can overlook logical
flaws, we introduce new NLI-based metrics to better measure multi-turn dialogue
consistency. Comprehensive experiments on the MT-Bench-101 benchmark show that
D-SMART significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, elevating the
dialogue consistency score by over 48\% for both proprietary and open-source
models, and notably improves the quality score of the latter by up to 10.1\%.

Motivation: 当前AI系统在说服能力方面存在挑战，现有研究往往忽视信息不对称的战略使用或依赖强假设的预先承诺。

Method: 提出两种变体：半正式自然语言贝叶斯说服和完全自然语言贝叶斯说服，通过承诺-沟通机制让说服者叙述潜在类型来引导信念更新。

Result: 实验表明：1）基于贝叶斯说服策略的LLM比非贝叶斯基线获得更高说服成功率；2）半正式变体更具可信度和逻辑一致性，完全自然语言变体在自然对话中情感共鸣更强；3）通过监督微调，小模型能达到与大模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯说服框架能有效增强LLM的战略说服能力，不同变体各有优势，且模型规模可通过微调来弥补。

Abstract: Persuasion, a fundamental social capability for humans, remains a challenge
for AI systems such as large language models (LLMs). Current studies often
overlook the strategic use of information asymmetry in message design or rely
on strong assumptions regarding pre-commitment. In this work, we explore the
application of Bayesian Persuasion (BP) in natural language within single-turn
dialogue settings, to enhance the strategic persuasion capabilities of LLMs.
Our framework incorporates a commitment-communication mechanism, where the
persuader explicitly outlines an information schema by narrating their
potential types (e.g., honest or dishonest), thereby guiding the persuadee in
performing the intended Bayesian belief update. We evaluate two variants of our
approach: Semi-Formal-Natural-Language (SFNL) BP and Fully-Natural-Language
(FNL) BP, benchmarking them against both naive and strong non-BP (NBP)
baselines within a comprehensive evaluation framework. This framework covers a
diverse set of persuadees -- including LLM instances with varying prompts and
fine-tuning and human participants -- across tasks ranging from specially
designed persuasion scenarios to general everyday situations. Experimental
results on LLM-based agents reveal three main findings: (1) LLMs guided by BP
strategies consistently achieve higher persuasion success rates than NBP
baselines; (2) SFNL exhibits greater credibility and logical coherence, while
FNL shows stronger emotional resonance and robustness in naturalistic
conversations; (3) with supervised fine-tuning, smaller models can attain BP
performance comparable to that of larger models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索生成代理基础模型Concordia能否有效模拟真实世界环境中的心智理论能力，并评估GPT-4是否能基于社会情境进行真正推理而非依赖语言记忆。

Method: 使用生成代理基础模型Concordia框架，在模拟真实世界环境中评估GPT-4的心智理论能力，特别关注其是否基于信念归因选择行动。

Result: GPT-4经常无法基于信念归因选择行动，其表面上的心智理论能力可能源于浅层统计关联；模型在生成代理行动的连贯因果效应方面也存在困难。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了当前关于LLM中心智理论能力涌现的说法，强调需要更严格的基于行动的评价框架来评估此类能力。

Abstract: Language is fundamental to human cooperation, facilitating not only the
exchange of information but also the coordination of actions through shared
interpretations of situational contexts. This study explores whether the
Generative Agent-Based Model (GABM) Concordia can effectively model Theory of
Mind (ToM) within simulated real-world environments. Specifically, we assess
whether this framework successfully simulates ToM abilities and whether GPT-4
can perform tasks by making genuine inferences from social context, rather than
relying on linguistic memorization. Our findings reveal a critical limitation:
GPT-4 frequently fails to select actions based on belief attribution,
suggesting that apparent ToM-like abilities observed in previous studies may
stem from shallow statistical associations rather than true reasoning.
Additionally, the model struggles to generate coherent causal effects from
agent actions, exposing difficulties in processing complex social interactions.
These results challenge current statements about emergent ToM-like capabilities
in LLMs and highlight the need for more rigorous, action-based evaluation
frameworks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过系统发育比较模型分析三个语系（南岛语系、印欧语系、乌拉尔语系）的词典数据，探讨概念对共词化的演化动态，发现关联性强的概念对更易共词化且变化较慢，而高频和易借用的概念对变化更快且较少共词化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言意义如何演变及其决定因素尚未完全理解，共词化现象为研究跨语言意义变化动态提供了重要窗口。

Method: 应用系统发育比较模型分析三个语系的词典数据，评估关联性、可借用性和使用频率三个预测因子对概念对共词化的影响。

Result: 关联性强的概念对在语系树中更广泛共词化且变化较慢；高频和易借用概念对变化更快且较少共词化；不同语系间存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 概念对的共词化受多种因素影响，包括语义关联性、使用频率和借用倾向，且存在语系特异性，表明地域和文化因素可能发挥作用。

Abstract: One of the most intriguing features of language is its constant change, with
ongoing shifts in how meaning is expressed. Despite decades of research, the
factors that determine how and why meanings evolve remain only partly
understood. Colexification -- the phenomenon of expressing multiple distinct
concepts using the same word form -- serves as a valuable window onto the
dynamics of meaning change across languages. Here, we apply phylogenetic
comparative models to dictionary data from three language families,
Austronesian, Indo-European, and Uralic, in order to shed light on the
evolutionary dynamics underlying the colexification of concept pairs. We assess
the effects of three predictors: associativity, borrowability, and usage
frequency. Our results show that more closely related concept pairs are
colexified across a larger portion of the family tree and exhibit slower rates
of change. In contrast, concept pairs that are more frequent and more prone to
borrowing tend to change more rapidly and are less often colexified. We also
find considerable differences between the language families under study,
suggesting that areal and cultural factors may play a role.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统综述了阿拉伯语大语言模型基准测试，分析了40多个评估基准，涵盖NLP任务、知识领域、文化理解和专业能力，提出了分类法并识别了关键差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为阿拉伯语NLP研究者提供关于基准测试方法、可复现性标准和评估指标的全面参考，同时为未来发展提供建议。

Method: 提出将基准测试分为四类的分类法：知识、NLP任务、文化与方言、目标特定评估；分析三种主要方法：原生收集、翻译和合成生成。

Result: 分析显示基准测试多样性显著进步，但识别出关键差距：时间评估有限、多轮对话评估不足、翻译数据集中的文化错位。

Conclusion: 这项工作为阿拉伯语NLP研究提供了有价值的参考，指出了当前基准测试的优缺点，并为未来发展方向提供了指导。

Abstract: This survey provides the first systematic review of Arabic LLM benchmarks,
analyzing 40+ evaluation benchmarks across NLP tasks, knowledge domains,
cultural understanding, and specialized capabilities. We propose a taxonomy
organizing benchmarks into four categories: Knowledge, NLP Tasks, Culture and
Dialects, and Target-Specific evaluations. Our analysis reveals significant
progress in benchmark diversity while identifying critical gaps: limited
temporal evaluation, insufficient multi-turn dialogue assessment, and cultural
misalignment in translated datasets. We examine three primary approaches:
native collection, translation, and synthetic generation discussing their
trade-offs regarding authenticity, scale, and cost. This work serves as a
comprehensive reference for Arabic NLP researchers, providing insights into
benchmark methodologies, reproducibility standards, and evaluation metrics
while offering recommendations for future development.

TL;DR: M^2PO是一个用于机器翻译的多对多视角偏好优化框架，通过整合幻觉惩罚和动态质量评分来改进奖励信号，并利用多对构造策略从所有翻译候选中系统创建偏好对，显著提升了翻译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DPO方法存在两个主要问题：(1)质量评估模型提供的奖励信号存在缺陷，忽略了关键错误如翻译幻觉；(2)数据利用效率低下，仅选择单一胜负对而丢弃了有价值的学习信号。

Method: 提出M^2PO框架，包含：多视角奖励引擎（结合幻觉惩罚和动态质量评分）和多对构造策略（从所有翻译候选中系统创建全面的偏好对）。

Result: 在WMT21-22基准测试中，M^2PO显著优于现有偏好优化方法，并与领先的专有大语言模型表现出高度竞争力。

Conclusion: M^2PO通过更稳健的奖励信号和更高效的数据利用，能够产生更稳健和忠实的翻译，解决了当前DPO方法的关键局限性。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a powerful paradigm for aligning
Large Language Models (LLMs) to human preferences in Machine Translation (MT),
but current methods are hindered by two fundamental challenges: (1) flawed
reward signals from Quality Estimation (QE) models that overlook critical
errors like translation hallucination, and (2) inefficient data utilization
that discards valuable learning signals by selecting only a single win-loss
pair. To address these limitations, we introduce M^2PO: Multi-Pair,
Multi-Perspective Preference Optimization. Our framework integrates a
multi-perspective reward engine that creates a more robust signal by combining
two key viewpoints: a new hallucination penalty for factuality, and an
innovative dynamic quality score that adaptively fuses external evaluations
with the model's own evolving judgment. This is synergistically paired with a
multi-pair construction strategy that systematically creates a comprehensive
set of preference pairs from the entire pool of translation candidates. This
synergistic approach ensures the model learns from a richer spectrum of quality
trade-offs, leading to more robust and faithful translations. On challenging
WMT21-22 benchmarks, M^2PO substantially outperforms existing preference
optimization methods and demonstrates highly competitive performance against
leading proprietary LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了LiteraryQA，一个基于NarrativeQA的高质量文学问答子集，通过人工和LLM验证流程清理数据，并评估了各种自动评估指标在系统级相关性上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NarrativeQA作为叙事文本问答领域最广泛使用的基准，其可靠性受到噪声文档和有缺陷问答对的限制，需要构建更高质量的数据集。

Method: 使用人工和LLM验证的流程识别和修正低质量问答样本，同时从源文档中移除无关文本，并对自动评估指标进行元评估。

Result: 发现所有基于n-gram的指标在系统级与人类判断的相关性较低，而LLM-as-a-Judge评估（即使是小型开源模型）能够与人类排名高度一致。

Conclusion: LiteraryQA为叙事文本问答提供了更可靠的基准，LLM评估方法优于传统n-gram指标，并在长上下文LLM上进行了基准测试。

Abstract: Question Answering (QA) on narrative text poses a unique challenge to current
systems, requiring a deep understanding of long, complex documents. However,
the reliability of NarrativeQA, the most widely used benchmark in this domain,
is hindered by noisy documents and flawed QA pairs. In this work, we introduce
LiteraryQA, a high-quality subset of NarrativeQA focused on literary works.
Using a human- and LLM-validated pipeline, we identify and correct low-quality
QA samples while removing extraneous text from source documents. We then carry
out a meta-evaluation of automatic metrics to clarify how systems should be
evaluated on LiteraryQA. This analysis reveals that all n-gram-based metrics
have a low system-level correlation to human judgment, while LLM-as-a-Judge
evaluations, even with small open-weight models, can strongly agree with the
ranking identified by humans. Finally, we benchmark a set of long-context LLMs
on LiteraryQA. We release our code and data at
https://github.com/SapienzaNLP/LiteraryQA.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了首个动态实时评估基准\bench，专门用于评估大语言模型在真实世界公共讨论中理解人类意图的能力，特别是在消费领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏大规模基准来评估LLMs在真实世界人类意图理解方面的能力，主要由于收集真实公共讨论数据和构建稳健评估流程的挑战。真实世界公共讨论具有交织冲突观点、分歧关切、目标、情感倾向以及隐含假设等特点。

Method: 构建了\bench基准，这是同类中最大且最多样化的基准，支持实时更新，并通过自动化策展流程防止数据污染。

Result: \bench是首个专门为意图理解设计的动态实时评估基准，特别关注消费领域，解决了现有基准的不足。

Conclusion: \bench基准填补了LLMs在真实世界人类意图理解评估方面的空白，为评估模型在复杂、不确定环境中的推理能力提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Understanding human intent is a complex, high-level task for large language
models (LLMs), requiring analytical reasoning, contextual interpretation,
dynamic information aggregation, and decision-making under uncertainty.
Real-world public discussions, such as consumer product discussions, are rarely
linear or involve a single user. Instead, they are characterized by interwoven
and often conflicting perspectives, divergent concerns, goals, emotional
tendencies, as well as implicit assumptions and background knowledge about
usage scenarios. To accurately understand such explicit public intent, an LLM
must go beyond parsing individual sentences; it must integrate multi-source
signals, reason over inconsistencies, and adapt to evolving discourse, similar
to how experts in fields like politics, economics, or finance approach complex,
uncertain environments. Despite the importance of this capability, no
large-scale benchmark currently exists for evaluating LLMs on real-world human
intent understanding, primarily due to the challenges of collecting real-world
public discussion data and constructing a robust evaluation pipeline. To bridge
this gap, we introduce \bench, the first dynamic, live evaluation benchmark
specifically designed for intent understanding, particularly in the consumer
domain. \bench is the largest and most diverse benchmark of its kind,
supporting real-time updates while preventing data contamination through an
automated curation pipeline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗LLMs面临知识快速更新和训练数据错误的问题，生成过时或不准确信息限制了临床应用。参数编辑损害局部性，检索编辑面临表示重叠和批量编辑缺失的挑战。

Method: 构建MedVersa基准评估单样本和批量编辑，提出MedREK框架，集成共享查询-键模块进行精确匹配，结合基于注意力的提示编码器提供信息指导。

Result: 在多个医疗基准测试中，MedREK在不同核心指标上均取得优异性能，首次为医疗LLMs提供了经过验证的批量编辑解决方案。

Conclusion: MedREK框架有效解决了医疗LLMs知识更新问题，支持批量编辑，为临床实践提供了可行的知识更新方案。

Abstract: LLMs hold great promise for healthcare applications, but the rapid evolution
of medical knowledge and errors in training data often cause them to generate
outdated or inaccurate information, limiting their applicability in high-stakes
clinical practice. Model editing has emerged as a potential remedy without full
retraining. While parameter-based editing often compromises locality and is
thus ill-suited for the medical domain, retrieval-based editing offers a more
viable alternative. However, it still faces two critical challenges: (1)
representation overlap within the medical knowledge space often causes
inaccurate retrieval and reduces editing accuracy; (2) existing methods are
restricted to single-sample edits, while batch-editing remains largely
unexplored despite its importance for real-world medical applications. To
address these challenges, we first construct MedVersa, \hk{an enhanced
benchmark with broader coverage of medical subjects, designed to evaluate both
single and batch edits under strict locality constraints}. We then propose
MedREK, a retrieval-based editing framework that integrates a shared query-key
module for precise matching with an attention-based prompt encoder for
informative guidance. Experimental results on various medical benchmarks
demonstrate that our MedREK achieves superior performance across different core
metrics and provides the first validated solution for batch-editing in medical
LLMs. Our code and dataset are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM的推理模式不透明，传统强化学习对整个生成过程采用均匀信用分配，无法区分关键步骤和常规步骤。

Method: 区分局部和全局注意力头，提出窗口平均注意力距离和未来注意力影响两个度量，识别预规划和锚定机制，并设计三种针对关键节点的强化学习策略。

Result: 在多种推理任务中，基于注意力洞察的强化学习策略带来了持续的性能提升。

Conclusion: 通过将优化与模型内在推理节奏对齐，可以将不透明的优化转变为结构感知的过程，为LLM推理的透明和有效优化提供了潜在路径。

Abstract: The reasoning pattern of Large language models (LLMs) remains opaque, and
Reinforcement learning (RL) typically applies uniform credit across an entire
generation, blurring the distinction between pivotal and routine steps. This
work positions attention as a privileged substrate that renders the internal
logic of LLMs legible, not merely as a byproduct of computation, but as a
mechanistic blueprint of reasoning itself. We first distinguish attention heads
between locally and globally focused information processing and reveal that
locally focused heads produce a sawtooth pattern near the diagonal indicating
phrasal chunks, while globally focused heads expose tokens that exert broad
downstream influence over future tokens. We formalize these with two metrics:
1) Windowed Average Attention Distance, which measures the extent of backward
attention within a clipped window; 2) Future Attention Influence, which
quantifies a token's global importance as the average attention it receives
from subsequent tokens. Taken together, these signals reveal a recurring
preplan-and-anchor mechanism, where the model first performs a long-range
contextual reference to generate an introductory token, which is immediately
followed by or coincides with a semantic anchor token that organizes subsequent
reasoning. Leveraging these insights, we introduce three novel RL strategies
that dynamically perform targeted credit assignment to critical nodes (preplan
tokens, anchor tokens, and their temporal coupling) and show consistent
performance gains across various reasoning tasks. By aligning optimization with
the model's intrinsic reasoning rhythm, we aim to transform opaque optimization
into an actionable structure-aware process, hoping to offer a potential step
toward more transparent and effective optimization of LLM reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过识别语言特定子网络进行针对性微调的方法，以提升LLM在低资源语言上的单语能力，同时保持通用性能。该方法仅更新1%的模型参数，在12种中低资源语言上表现优于多种基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在不同语言间表现不均，高资源语言和低资源语言之间存在显著性能差距。需要一种方法能够提升低资源语言的性能，同时不损害模型的通用能力。

Method: 使用语言激活概率熵识别语言特定神经元，然后仅对这些神经元相关的权重进行微调。该方法只更新目标语言数据相关的专用子网络。

Result: 在Llama-3.1-8B和Mistral-Nemo-12B模型上的实验表明，该方法在12种中低资源语言上持续优于全微调、FFN-only微调、LoRA适应和随机子集微调等基线方法，同时仅更新最多1%的模型参数。

Conclusion: 该方法为将最先进模型适配到低资源语言提供了一条成本效益高的途径，同时观察到改进的训练动态、跨语言表示对齐和系统性的权重更新变化。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit uneven performance across languages, with
substantial gaps between high- and low-resource languages. We present a
framework for enhancing monolingual capabilities of LLMs in underrepresented
languages while preserving their general-purpose performance through targeted
fine-tuning of language-specific subnetworks. Our approach identifies
language-specific neurons using Language Activation Probability Entropy and
fine-tunes only the weights associated with these neurons, a dedicated
subnetwork, on target-language data. Experiments on Llama-3.1-8B and
Mistral-Nemo-12B across 12 mid- and low-resource languages demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms full fine-tuning, FFN-only fine-tuning, LoRA
adaptation, and random subset fine-tuning baselines while efficiently updating
only up to 1% of model parameters. Beyond performance improvements, we observe
enhanced favorable training dynamics, cross-lingual representational alignment,
and systematic weight update changes. To facilitate future research, we release
language-specific neuron identifications for over 100 languages as well as our
adaptation pipeline, offering a cost-effective pathway for adapting
state-of-the-art models to underrepresented languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格到文本生成基准测试存在LLM训练数据污染和领域不平衡的问题，且非英语数据集有限。

Method: 从维基百科实时收集表格数据，生成多语言（英语、德语、俄语、法语）的表格到文本基准测试数据集。

Result: LLM从新收集表格生成的见解在自动指标上表现较差，但LLM和人工评估结果不一致；领域效应在所有评估中都很明显。

Conclusion: FreshTab能有效应对数据污染问题，领域平衡的基准测试更具挑战性。

Abstract: Table-to-text generation (insight generation from tables) is a challenging
task that requires precision in analyzing the data. In addition, the evaluation
of existing benchmarks is affected by contamination of Large Language Model
(LLM) training data as well as domain imbalance. We introduce FreshTab, an
on-the-fly table-to-text benchmark generation from Wikipedia, to combat the LLM
data contamination problem and enable domain-sensitive evaluation. While
non-English table-to-text datasets are limited, FreshTab collects datasets in
different languages on demand (we experiment with German, Russian and French in
addition to English). We find that insights generated by LLMs from recent
tables collected by our method appear clearly worse by automatic metrics, but
this does not translate into LLM and human evaluations. Domain effects are
visible in all evaluations, showing that a~domain-balanced benchmark is more
challenging.

Motivation: 现有稀疏注意力方法虽然减少了内存访问，但KV缓存大小未减少，限制了GPU批处理规模和解码吞吐量，特别是在大规模批处理推理中。

Method: 将令牌选择分解为查询感知和查询无关组件，引入显式局部性约束，减少KV对在CPU和GPU之间的传输，同时保持与训练时相同的注意力计算。

Result: 预训练的1B参数模型在保持接近无损性能的同时，相比基准方法(InfLLM-V2)实现了解码吞吐量最高2.3倍的提升。

Conclusion: NOSA通过显式局部性约束有效解决了KV缓存传输瓶颈，在保持性能的同时显著提升了解码效率，为大规模批处理推理提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Trainable sparse attention has emerged as a promising solution to address the
decoding efficiency bottleneck of LLMs in long-context processing,
significantly saving memory accesses while minimally impacting task
performance. However, existing sparse attention methods leave a crucial
limitation unresolved: the size of the key-value (KV) cache remains unreduced,
which constrains on-GPU batch sizes and throttles decoding throughput,
especially in large-scale batched inference. In this paper, we show that
trainable sparse attention naturally exhibits strong locality in token
selection across adjacent decoding steps, thereby enabling KV cache offloading
without altering the underlying attention computation. However, the inherent
locality remains insufficient to achieve efficient offloading, as the transfer
of selected KV pairs between the CPU and GPU continues to dominate the overall
decoding cost. Building on this insight, we present NOSA, a trainable sparse
attention framework designed to natively support KV cache offloading. NOSA
introduces explicit locality constraints by decomposing token selection into
query-aware and query-agnostic components, thereby reducing KV transfers while
preserving the same attention computation as used during training. We pretrain
a 1B-parameter model with NOSA and conduct extensive benchmarks, showing that
it preserves near-lossless performance while achieving up to a 2.3x improvement
in decoding throughput compared with the vanilla trainable sparse attention
baseline (InfLLM-V2).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemoTime是一个记忆增强的时序知识图谱框架，通过结构化基础、递归推理和持续经验学习来增强LLM的时序推理能力，在多个时序QA基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在时序理解方面存在困难，特别是在涉及多实体、复合操作符和演化事件序列的问题上。现有的时序知识图谱推理方法面临四个主要挑战：多跳推理中的时序忠实性、多实体时序同步、适应不同时序操作符的检索，以及重用先前推理经验以提高稳定性和效率。

Method: 提出MemoTime框架，将复杂时序问题分解为层次化的时间树，实现操作符感知推理，强制执行单调时间戳并在统一时间边界下共同约束多个实体。包含动态证据检索层和自演化经验记忆模块。

Result: 在多个时序QA基准测试中实现整体最先进结果，比强基线提升高达24.0%。MemoTime使较小模型（如Qwen3-4B）能够达到与GPT-4-Turbo相当的推理性能。

Conclusion: MemoTime通过结构化时序推理和持续经验学习，有效解决了LLM在时序理解方面的挑战，显著提升了时序推理能力，并使较小模型也能获得强大的时序推理性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive reasoning abilities,
but struggle with temporal understanding, especially when questions involve
multiple entities, compound operators, and evolving event sequences. Temporal
Knowledge Graphs (TKGs), which capture vast amounts of temporal facts in a
structured format, offer a reliable source for temporal reasoning. However,
existing TKG-based LLM reasoning methods still struggle with four major
challenges: maintaining temporal faithfulness in multi-hop reasoning, achieving
multi-entity temporal synchronization, adapting retrieval to diverse temporal
operators, and reusing prior reasoning experience for stability and efficiency.
To address these issues, we propose MemoTime, a memory-augmented temporal
knowledge graph framework that enhances LLM reasoning through structured
grounding, recursive reasoning, and continual experience learning. MemoTime
decomposes complex temporal questions into a hierarchical Tree of Time,
enabling operator-aware reasoning that enforces monotonic timestamps and
co-constrains multiple entities under unified temporal bounds. A dynamic
evidence retrieval layer adaptively selects operator-specific retrieval
strategies, while a self-evolving experience memory stores verified reasoning
traces, toolkit decisions, and sub-question embeddings for cross-type reuse.
Comprehensive experiments on multiple temporal QA benchmarks show that MemoTime
achieves overall state-of-the-art results, outperforming the strong baseline by
up to 24.0%. Furthermore, MemoTime enables smaller models (e.g., Qwen3-4B) to
achieve reasoning performance comparable to that of GPT-4-Turbo.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 德国肿瘤诊断需要准确的ICD-10-GM和ICD-O-3编码，但开源大语言模型在德语语境下的编码准确性较差，需要提升其性能以实现隐私保护的自动化编码。

Method: 基于ICD-10-GM、ICD-O-3和OPS目录创建了超过50万个问答对作为训练数据，对Qwen、Llama和Mistral家族的8个开源模型（7-70B参数）进行了指令微调。

Result: ICD-10-GM准确率从1.4-24%提升至41-58%，部分准确率从31-74%提升至73-83%；ICD-O-3地形编码准确率从较低水平提升至22-40%，畸形代码输出降至0%，肿瘤诊断识别率达99%。

Conclusion: 利用公开目录构建指令数据集可以有效提升大语言模型在医疗文档任务中的性能，模型大小与准确性正相关但微调后差距缩小，推理模式性能较低且速度慢100倍。

Abstract: Accurate coding of tumor diagnoses with ICD-10-GM and ICD-O-3 is essential
for structured cancer documentation in Germany. Smaller open-weight LLMs are
appealing for privacy-preserving automation but often struggle with coding
accuracy in German-language contexts. This study investigates whether
instruction-based fine-tuning on public datasets improves the coding accuracy
of open-weight LLMs for German tumor diagnosis texts. The evaluation uses coded
diagnoses from the local tumor documentation system as test data. In a
systematic data quality assessment, the upper limit for ICD-10 coding
performance was estimated at 60-79% for exact and 81-94% for partial
(three-character codes only) derivation. As training data, over 500,000
question-answer pairs were created based on the ICD-10-GM, ICD-O-3, and OPS
catalogues. Eight open-weight models from the Qwen, Llama, and Mistral families
(7-70 B parameters) were fine-tuned. ICD-10-GM accuracy rose from 1.4-24% to
41-58%, and partial accuracy from 31-74% to 73-83%. The accuracy of ICD-O-3
topography coding also improved but started and remained considerably lower
with an exact accuracy of 22-40% and a partial accuracy of 56-67% after
fine-tuning. Malformed code outputs dropped to 0% for all models.
Tumor-diagnosis recognition reached 99%. Accuracy correlated positively with
model size, but gaps between small and large models narrowed after fine-tuning.
The reasoning mode in Qwen3 generally yielded a lower performance than
fine-tuning and was over 100 times slower. Our findings highlight the potential
of leveraging public catalogues to build instruction datasets that improve LLMs
in medical documentation tasks. The complete training dataset and the
best-performing checkpoints of the fine-tuned models are available from

TL;DR: SALAD方法通过跨模态蒸馏和有针对性的合成数据，使用更少的语音数据有效缩小文本-语音理解差距，在3B和7B LLMs上取得竞争性表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语音适配LLMs在语言理解任务中表现不如文本LLMs的问题（文本-语音理解差距），现有方法依赖大规模语音合成或专有数据集，需要更数据高效的方法。

Method: 提出SALAD方法，结合跨模态蒸馏和有针对性的合成数据，通过主动选择学习来改善对齐并减轻遗忘问题。

Result: 在3B和7B LLMs上，SALAD使用比现有方法少一个数量级的公共语料库语音数据，在知识、语言理解和推理等广泛领域基准测试中达到与强开源模型竞争的性能。

Conclusion: SALAD提供了一种数据高效的方法来缩小文本-语音理解差距，通过分析遗忘和跨模态不对齐两个关键因素并针对性解决，显著减少了训练所需的语音数据量。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can be adapted to extend their text capabilities
to speech inputs. However, these speech-adapted LLMs consistently underperform
their text-based counterparts--and even cascaded pipelines--on language
understanding tasks. We term this shortfall the text-speech understanding gap:
the performance drop observed when a speech-adapted LLM processes spoken inputs
relative to when the original text-based LLM processes the equivalent text.
Recent approaches to narrowing this gap either rely on large-scale speech
synthesis of text corpora, which is costly and heavily dependent on synthetic
data, or on large-scale proprietary speech datasets, which are not
reproducible. As a result, there remains a need for more data-efficient
alternatives for closing the text-speech understanding gap. In this work, we
analyze the gap as driven by two factors: (i) forgetting of text capabilities
during adaptation, and (ii) cross-modal misalignment between speech and text.
Based on this analysis, we introduce SALAD--Sample-efficient Alignment with
Learning through Active selection and cross-modal Distillation--which combines
cross-modal distillation with targeted synthetic data to improve alignment
while mitigating forgetting. Applied to 3B and 7B LLMs, SALAD achieves
competitive performance with a strong open-weight model across broad-domain
benchmarks in knowledge, language understanding, and reasoning, while training
on over an order of magnitude less speech data from public corpora.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了基于采样的解码策略对LLM生成文本检测器性能的影响，发现即使微小的解码参数调整也会严重降低检测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本检测器在固定生成设置下报告接近完美的准确率，但其在解码策略变化下的鲁棒性尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 系统性地考察采样解码对可检测性的影响，重点关注模型在(子)词级分布的细微变化如何影响检测性能。

Result: 即使对温度、top-p或核采样等解码参数进行微小调整，也会严重损害检测器准确率，AUROC从接近完美水平降至1%。

Conclusion: 当前检测方法存在关键盲点，需要更全面的评估协议。作者发布了包含37种解码配置的大规模数据集和评估框架。

Abstract: As texts generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) are ever more common and
often indistinguishable from human-written content, research on automatic text
detection has attracted growing attention. Many recent detectors report
near-perfect accuracy, often boasting AUROC scores above 99\%. However, these
claims typically assume fixed generation settings, leaving open the question of
how robust such systems are to changes in decoding strategies. In this work, we
systematically examine how sampling-based decoding impacts detectability, with
a focus on how subtle variations in a model's (sub)word-level distribution
affect detection performance. We find that even minor adjustments to decoding
parameters - such as temperature, top-p, or nucleus sampling - can severely
impair detector accuracy, with AUROC dropping from near-perfect levels to 1\%
in some settings. Our findings expose critical blind spots in current detection
methods and emphasize the need for more comprehensive evaluation protocols. To
facilitate future research, we release a large-scale dataset encompassing 37
decoding configurations, along with our code and evaluation framework

Motivation: 现有多模态模型受限于自回归架构，无法平衡理解和生成能力，而混合和解耦策略的设计冗余且不集成，限制了在更广泛场景中的应用。

Method: 利用度量诱导概率路径和动力学最优速度的离散流范式，通过简洁的统一表示而非任务解耦设计，实现任意模态间的理解和生成。

Result: 在大规模交错文本、图像、视频和音频数据上训练，在多模态生成和理解基准测试中表现有竞争力，在多轮多模态交互和跨模态检索方面优于先前的统一模型。

Conclusion: NExT-OMNI作为下一代多模态基础模型，通过离散流范式实现了统一建模，展现了架构优势，并开源了训练细节、数据协议、代码和模型检查点以推动进一步研究。

Abstract: Next-generation multimodal foundation models capable of any-to-any
cross-modal generation and multi-turn interaction will serve as core components
of artificial general intelligence systems, playing a pivotal role in
human-machine interaction. However, most existing multimodal models remain
constrained by autoregressive architectures, whose inherent limitations prevent
a balanced integration of understanding and generation capabilities. Although
hybrid and decoupling strategies have been explored to address these tasks
within unified frameworks separately, their redundant, non-integrated designs
limit their applicability to broader scenarios, such as cross-modal
retrieval.In this work, we introduce NExT-OMNI, an open-source omnimodal
foundation model that achieves unified modeling through discrete flow
paradigms. By leveraging metric-induced probability paths and kinetic optimal
velocities, NExT-OMNI natively supports any-to-any understanding and generation
with enhanced response efficiency, while enabling broader application scenarios
through concise unified representations rather than task-decoupled designs.
Trained on large-scale interleaved text, image, video, and audio data,
NExT-OMNI delivers competitive performance on multimodal generation and
understanding benchmarks, while outperforming prior unified models in
multi-turn multimodal interaction and cross-modal retrieval, highlighting its
architectural advantages as a next-generation multimodal foundation model. To
advance further research, we release training details, data protocols, and
open-source both the code and model checkpoints.

Motivation: 现有的AI临床医生系统基准测试主要基于选择题或人工评分标准，无法捕捉真实临床实践所需的深度、鲁棒性和安全性。

Method: 开发了全自动的指南锚定流程，构建证据邻域，创建双图树表示，自动生成跨G级别的问题，使用DeepResearch代理合成评分标准，并由LLM评委进行评分。

Conclusion: 这种自动化、临床基础的方法为严格评估AI临床医生系统提供了可重复和可扩展的方法，指导其向更安全可靠的临床实践发展。

Abstract: Current benchmarks for AI clinician systems, often based on multiple-choice
exams or manual rubrics, fail to capture the depth, robustness, and safety
required for real-world clinical practice. To address this, we introduce the
GAPS framework, a multidimensional paradigm for evaluating \textbf{G}rounding
(cognitive depth), \textbf{A}dequacy (answer completeness),
\textbf{P}erturbation (robustness), and \textbf{S}afety. Critically, we
developed a fully automated, guideline-anchored pipeline to construct a
GAPS-aligned benchmark end-to-end, overcoming the scalability and subjectivity
limitations of prior work. Our pipeline assembles an evidence neighborhood,
creates dual graph and tree representations, and automatically generates
questions across G-levels. Rubrics are synthesized by a DeepResearch agent that
mimics GRADE-consistent, PICO-driven evidence review in a ReAct loop. Scoring
is performed by an ensemble of large language model (LLM) judges. Validation
confirmed our automated questions are high-quality and align with clinician
judgment. Evaluating state-of-the-art models on the benchmark revealed key
failure modes: performance degrades sharply with increased reasoning depth
(G-axis), models struggle with answer completeness (A-axis), and they are
highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations (P-axis) as well as certain
safety issues (S-axis). This automated, clinically-grounded approach provides a
reproducible and scalable method for rigorously evaluating AI clinician systems
and guiding their development toward safer, more reliable clinical practice.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估聊天助手网络搜索行为的新方法，重点关注来源可信度和回答与引用来源的关联性。通过测试GPT-4o、GPT-5、Perplexity和Qwen Chat在100个易传播错误信息的声明上的表现，发现不同助手在可信度方面存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着聊天助手集成网络搜索功能，虽然能提供更可靠的答案，但也存在放大低可信度来源错误信息的风险。需要系统评估助手在事实核查行为中的表现。

Method: 使用100个涉及五个易传播错误信息主题的声明，评估GPT-4o、GPT-5、Perplexity和Qwen Chat四个聊天助手，重点关注来源可信度和回答与引用来源的关联性。

Result: 不同助手表现存在差异，Perplexity获得最高的来源可信度，而GPT-4o在敏感话题上对非可信来源的引用率较高。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次对常用聊天助手的事实核查行为进行了系统比较，为评估高风险信息环境中的AI系统提供了基础。

Abstract: Chat assistants increasingly integrate web search functionality, enabling
them to retrieve and cite external sources. While this promises more reliable
answers, it also raises the risk of amplifying misinformation from
low-credibility sources. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology for
evaluating assistants' web search behavior, focusing on source credibility and
the groundedness of responses with respect to cited sources. Using 100 claims
across five misinformation-prone topics, we assess GPT-4o, GPT-5, Perplexity,
and Qwen Chat. Our findings reveal differences between the assistants, with
Perplexity achieving the highest source credibility, whereas GPT-4o exhibits
elevated citation of non-credibility sources on sensitive topics. This work
provides the first systematic comparison of commonly used chat assistants for
fact-checking behavior, offering a foundation for evaluating AI systems in
high-stakes information environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于前馈网络激活的检索增强生成系统置信度估计方法，在金融客服场景中优于基线方法，同时满足严格的延迟要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域（如金融和医疗）中，置信度估计至关重要，因为错误答案的代价远高于不回答问题。现有方法存在信息损失问题。

Method: 利用原始前馈网络激活作为自回归信号，避免投影和softmax归一化造成的信息损失；将置信度预测建模为序列分类任务，使用Huber损失进行正则化训练。

Result: 在金融行业客服场景中优于强基线方法，在Llama 3.1 8B模型上仅使用第16层激活即可保持准确性并降低响应延迟。

Conclusion: 基于激活的置信度建模为可信赖的RAG部署提供了一条可扩展、架构感知的路径。

Abstract: We propose a method for confidence estimation in retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) systems that aligns closely with the correctness of large
language model (LLM) outputs. Confidence estimation is especially critical in
high-stakes domains such as finance and healthcare, where the cost of an
incorrect answer outweighs that of not answering the question. Our approach
extends prior uncertainty quantification methods by leveraging raw feed-forward
network (FFN) activations as auto-regressive signals, avoiding the information
loss inherent in token logits and probabilities after projection and softmax
normalization. We model confidence prediction as a sequence classification
task, and regularize training with a Huber loss term to improve robustness
against noisy supervision. Applied in a real-world financial industry
customer-support setting with complex knowledge bases, our method outperforms
strong baselines and maintains high accuracy under strict latency constraints.
Experiments on Llama 3.1 8B model show that using activations from only the
16th layer preserves accuracy while reducing response latency. Our results
demonstrate that activation-based confidence modeling offers a scalable,
architecture-aware path toward trustworthy RAG deployment.

Motivation: 研究符号接地在语言模型中的自发涌现机制，探索其具体发生位置和驱动机制，以理解大规模训练下语言模型如何获得真实世界意义。

Method: 引入受控评估框架，结合机制分析和因果分析，系统追踪符号接地在内部计算中的产生过程。

Result: 发现接地现象集中在中层计算，通过注意力头聚合环境信息支持语言形式预测；该现象在多模态对话和不同架构中复现，但在单向LSTM中未出现。

Conclusion: 提供了行为和机制证据表明符号接地可在语言模型中自发涌现，对预测和控制生成可靠性具有实际意义。

Abstract: Symbol grounding (Harnad, 1990) describes how symbols such as words acquire
their meanings by connecting to real-world sensorimotor experiences. Recent
work has shown preliminary evidence that grounding may emerge in
(vision-)language models trained at scale without using explicit grounding
objectives. Yet, the specific loci of this emergence and the mechanisms that
drive it remain largely unexplored. To address this problem, we introduce a
controlled evaluation framework that systematically traces how symbol grounding
arises within the internal computations through mechanistic and causal
analysis. Our findings show that grounding concentrates in middle-layer
computations and is implemented through the aggregate mechanism, where
attention heads aggregate the environmental ground to support the prediction of
linguistic forms. This phenomenon replicates in multimodal dialogue and across
architectures (Transformers and state-space models), but not in unidirectional
LSTMs. Our results provide behavioral and mechanistic evidence that symbol
grounding can emerge in language models, with practical implications for
predicting and potentially controlling the reliability of generation.

TL;DR: 提出一种通过定期压缩生成KV缓存的方法来解决大语言模型长上下文推理中的内存和计算成本问题，使用学习到的专用令牌进行压缩，并通过改进的联合蒸馏和强化学习框架训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在长上下文推理中的可扩展性受到Transformer键值缓存线性增长的严重限制，导致显著的内存和计算成本。随着模型生成推理令牌，过去生成令牌的信息价值会减少，这为压缩创造了机会。

Method: 定期使用学习到的专用令牌压缩生成KV缓存并清除压缩条目，通过改进的联合蒸馏和强化学习框架训练模型执行压缩，利用RL输出进行蒸馏以最小化训练开销。

Result: 实证结果显示，该方法在内存-准确性帕累托边界上优于无缓存压缩的模型和无训练压缩技术。

Conclusion: 提出的KV缓存压缩方法能有效解决长上下文推理中的内存和计算瓶颈，在保持准确性的同时显著减少资源消耗。

Abstract: The scalability of large language models for long-context reasoning is
severely constrained by the linear growth of their Transformer key-value cache,
which incurs significant memory and computational costs. We posit that as a
model generates reasoning tokens, the informational value of past generated
tokens diminishes, creating an opportunity for compression. In this work, we
propose to periodically compress the generation KV cache with a learned,
special-purpose token and evict compressed entries. We train the model to
perform this compression via a modified joint distillation and reinforcement
learning (RL) framework. Our training method minimizes overhead over the
conventional RL process, as it leverages RL outputs for distillation.
Empirically, our method achieves a superior memory-accuracy Pareto frontier
compared to both the model without cache compression and training-free
compression techniques.

TL;DR: BRIEF-Pro是一个轻量级压缩器，可将检索到的文档压缩为简洁摘要，提升RAG系统在处理长上下文时的效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着RAG处理复杂任务，扩展的上下文虽然提供更丰富信息，但导致更高延迟和模型认知负担。需要解决多跳问答中的瓶颈问题。

Method: 使用短上下文种子数据训练BRIEF-Pro，使其能够对超过10k词的长上下文进行抽象压缩，并允许用户控制摘要长度。

Result: 在四个开放域多跳问答数据集上，BRIEF-Pro生成更简洁相关的摘要，提升各种规模语言模型的性能。70B模型上32倍压缩相比LongLLMLingua的9倍压缩提升4.67%性能，仅需23%计算开销。

Conclusion: BRIEF-Pro是一个通用轻量级压缩器，能有效压缩长上下文，提升RAG系统性能，同时降低计算成本。

Abstract: As retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) tackles complex tasks, increasingly
expanded contexts offer richer information, but at the cost of higher latency
and increased cognitive load on the model. To mitigate this bottleneck,
especially for intricate multi-hop questions, we introduce BRIEF-Pro. It is a
universal, lightweight compressor that distills relevant evidence for a given
query from retrieved documents into a concise summary for seamless integration
into in-context RAG. Using seed data consisting of relatively short contexts
(fewer than 1k words), BRIEF-Pro is trained to perform abstractive compression
of extended contexts exceeding 10k words across a wide range of scenarios.
Furthermore, BRIEF-Pro offers flexible user control over summary length by
allowing users to specify the desired number of sentences. Experiments on four
open-domain multi-hop question-answering datasets show that BRIEF-Pro generates
more concise and relevant summaries, enhancing performance across small, large,
and proprietary language models. With the 70B reader model, 32x compression by
BRIEF-Pro improves QA performance by 4.67% on average over LongLLMLingua's 9x,
while requiring only 23% of its computational overhead.

TL;DR: SimULi是一个实时渲染任意相机模型和LiDAR数据的神经渲染方法，解决了现有方法渲染速度慢、仅支持针孔相机模型以及多传感器不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经渲染方法（如NeRF和3DGS）渲染速度慢，仅支持针孔相机模型，无法满足自动驾驶等应用中需要高畸变镜头和LiDAR数据的需求，且多传感器仿真存在跨传感器不一致问题。

Method: 扩展3DGUT以支持LiDAR，通过自动分块策略处理任意旋转LiDAR模型和基于光线的剔除；设计因子化3D高斯表示和锚定策略来解决跨传感器不一致问题。

Result: 与现有方法相比，相机和深度误差平均降低40%；渲染速度比光线追踪方法快10-20倍，比基于光栅化的方法快1.5-10倍；在两个自动驾驶数据集上，在多个相机和LiDAR指标上达到或超过现有最先进方法的保真度。

Conclusion: SimULi是首个能够实时渲染任意相机模型和LiDAR数据的方法，显著提高了渲染速度和跨传感器一致性，为自动驾驶等应用的严格测试提供了有效的仿真工具。

Abstract: Rigorous testing of autonomous robots, such as self-driving vehicles, is
essential to ensure their safety in real-world deployments. This requires
building high-fidelity simulators to test scenarios beyond those that can be
safely or exhaustively collected in the real-world. Existing neural rendering
methods based on NeRF and 3DGS hold promise but suffer from low rendering
speeds or can only render pinhole camera models, hindering their suitability to
applications that commonly require high-distortion lenses and LiDAR data.
Multi-sensor simulation poses additional challenges as existing methods handle
cross-sensor inconsistencies by favoring the quality of one modality at the
expense of others. To overcome these limitations, we propose SimULi, the first
method capable of rendering arbitrary camera models and LiDAR data in
real-time. Our method extends 3DGUT, which natively supports complex camera
models, with LiDAR support, via an automated tiling strategy for arbitrary
spinning LiDAR models and ray-based culling. To address cross-sensor
inconsistencies, we design a factorized 3D Gaussian representation and
anchoring strategy that reduces mean camera and depth error by up to 40%
compared to existing methods. SimULi renders 10-20x faster than ray tracing
approaches and 1.5-10x faster than prior rasterization-based work (and handles
a wider range of camera models). When evaluated on two widely benchmarked
autonomous driving datasets, SimULi matches or exceeds the fidelity of existing
state-of-the-art methods across numerous camera and LiDAR metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前手术AI研究主要关注理解当前事件而非预测未来，缺乏统一的方法来同时处理短期和长期预测任务，且现有方法在不同手术情境下泛化能力有限。

Method: 采用教师-学生架构，通过Sinkhorn-Knopp聚类将视频片段压缩为状态表示，教师网络学习当前和未来片段，学生网络仅从当前视频预测未来状态，并引入Action Dynamics模块进行指导。

Result: 在四个数据集和三个手术程序中进行的实验显示出一致的改进效果，跨程序迁移验证了方法的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SurgFUTR通过状态变化学习框架有效解决了手术未来预测问题，在多个预测任务上表现出优越性能，并具有良好的跨程序泛化能力。

Abstract: Surgical future prediction, driven by real-time AI analysis of surgical
video, is critical for operating room safety and efficiency. It provides
actionable insights into upcoming events, their timing, and risks-enabling
better resource allocation, timely instrument readiness, and early warnings for
complications (e.g., bleeding, bile duct injury). Despite this need, current
surgical AI research focuses on understanding what is happening rather than
predicting future events. Existing methods target specific tasks in isolation,
lacking unified approaches that span both short-term (action triplets, events)
and long-term horizons (remaining surgery duration, phase transitions). These
methods rely on coarse-grained supervision while fine-grained surgical action
triplets and steps remain underexplored. Furthermore, methods based only on
future feature prediction struggle to generalize across different surgical
contexts and procedures. We address these limits by reframing surgical future
prediction as state-change learning. Rather than forecasting raw observations,
our approach classifies state transitions between current and future timesteps.
We introduce SurgFUTR, implementing this through a teacher-student
architecture. Video clips are compressed into state representations via
Sinkhorn-Knopp clustering; the teacher network learns from both current and
future clips, while the student network predicts future states from current
videos alone, guided by our Action Dynamics (ActDyn) module. We establish
SFPBench with five prediction tasks spanning short-term (triplets, events) and
long-term (remaining surgery duration, phase and step transitions) horizons.
Experiments across four datasets and three procedures show consistent
improvements. Cross-procedure transfer validates generalizability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习植物病害诊断系统在训练环境外图像上性能显著下降，主要原因是疾病症状的细微变化和领域差异，这源于训练数据多样性不足。

Method: TMPS基于度量学习，利用少量目标域标记样本，通过目标感知的度量学习和优先采样策略来改善诊断鲁棒性。

Result: 在包含223,073张叶片图像的大规模数据集上，仅使用每疾病10个目标域样本，TMPS相比基线模型平均宏F1分数分别提升7.3和3.6个百分点，相比传统度量学习提升18.7和17.1个百分点。

Conclusion: TMPS是一个简单但高度适应的学习框架，能有效利用少量目标域样本显著提升植物病害诊断模型在未知环境下的泛化能力。

Abstract: Various deep learning-based systems have been proposed for accurate and
convenient plant disease diagnosis, achieving impressive performance. However,
recent studies show that these systems often fail to maintain diagnostic
accuracy on images captured under different conditions from the training
environment -- an essential criterion for model robustness. Many deep learning
methods have shown high accuracy in plant disease diagnosis. However, they
often struggle to generalize to images taken in conditions that differ from the
training setting. This drop in performance stems from the subtle variability of
disease symptoms and domain gaps -- differences in image context and
environment. The root cause is the limited diversity of training data relative
to task complexity, making even advanced models vulnerable in unseen domains.
To tackle this challenge, we propose a simple yet highly adaptable learning
framework called Target-Aware Metric Learning with Prioritized Sampling (TMPS),
grounded in metric learning. TMPS operates under the assumption of access to a
limited number of labeled samples from the target (deployment) domain and
leverages these samples effectively to improve diagnostic robustness. We assess
TMPS on a large-scale automated plant disease diagnostic task using a dataset
comprising 223,073 leaf images sourced from 23 agricultural fields, spanning 21
diseases and healthy instances across three crop species. By incorporating just
10 target domain samples per disease into training, TMPS surpasses models
trained using the same combined source and target samples, and those fine-tuned
with these target samples after pre-training on source data. It achieves
average macro F1 score improvements of 7.3 and 3.6 points, respectively, and a
remarkable 18.7 and 17.1 point improvement over the baseline and conventional
metric learning.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve remarkable performance through
large-scale image-text pretraining. However, their reliance on labeled image
datasets limits scalability and leaves vast amounts of unlabeled image data
underutilized. To address this, we propose Unified Vision-Language Alignment
for Zero-Label Enhancement (ViZer), an enhancement training framework that
enables zero-label learning in image captioning, providing a practical starting
point for broader zero-label adaptation in vision-language tasks. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on human or synthetically annotated datasets, ViZer
actively aligns vision and language representation features during training,
enabling existing VLMs to generate improved captions without requiring text
labels or full retraining. We demonstrate ViZer's advantage in qualitative
evaluation, as automated caption metrics such as CIDEr and BERTScore often
penalize details that are absent in reference captions. Applying ViZer on
SmolVLM-Base and Qwen2-VL, we observe consistent qualitative improvements,
producing captions that are more grounded and descriptive than their baseline.

TL;DR: FetalMind是针对胎儿超声的医学AI系统，通过临床工作流引导的显著认知解耦方法，在报告生成和诊断任务上超越现有基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学视觉语言模型主要针对结构化成人影像，在胎儿超声领域表现不佳，面临多视图推理、疾病多样性和图像异质性等挑战。

Method: 提出显著认知解耦(SED)方法，将专家构建的二部图注入模型，解耦视图-疾病关联，并通过强化学习引导临床步骤选择。构建了首个大规模胎儿超声报告数据集FetalSigma-1M。

Result: FetalMind在所有孕周阶段均优于开源和闭源基线，平均提升14%，在关键病症上准确率提高61.2%，同时保持高效、稳定和可扩展性。

Conclusion: FetalMind通过临床工作流对齐和领域特定数据集，有效解决了胎儿超声AI应用的挑战，为医学影像分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent medical vision-language models have shown promise on tasks such as
VQA, report generation, and anomaly detection. However, most are adapted to
structured adult imaging and underperform in fetal ultrasound, which poses
challenges of multi-view image reasoning, numerous diseases, and image
diversity. To bridge this gap, we introduce FetalMind, a medical AI system
tailored to fetal ultrasound for both report generation and diagnosis. Guided
by clinical workflow, we propose Salient Epistemic Disentanglement (SED), which
injects an expert-curated bipartite graph into the model to decouple
view-disease associations and to steer preference selection along clinically
faithful steps via reinforcement learning. This design mitigates variability
across diseases and heterogeneity across views, reducing learning bottlenecks
while aligning the model's inference with obstetric practice. To train
FetalMind at scale, we curate FetalSigma-1M dataset, the first large-scale
fetal ultrasound report corpus, comprising 20K reports from twelve medical
centers, addressing the scarcity of domain data. Extensive experiments show
that FetalMind outperforms open- and closed-source baselines across all
gestational stages, achieving +14% average gains and +61.2% higher accuracy on
critical conditions while remaining efficient, stable, and scalable. Project

*Denis Rychkovskiy,GPT-5*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADE 2.5是一个用于SD/SDXL潜在扩散模型的采样器级引导堆栈，包含ZeResFDG核心模块和QSilk稳定器，旨在提升图像锐度、提示遵循度和伪影控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在采样过程中存在细节不足、伪影问题，需要一种无需重新训练的方法来改善图像质量和稳定性。

Method: ZeResFDG模块结合频率解耦引导、能量重缩放和零投影技术；QSilk稳定器通过分位数钳位和微细节注入提升鲁棒性。

Result: 该方法在SD/SDXL采样器中显著改善了图像锐度、提示遵循度和伪影控制，在高分辨率下能生成自然的微纹理。

Conclusion: CADE 2.5提供了一种有效的训练后增强方案，通过采样器级引导显著提升扩散模型的图像生成质量。

Abstract: We introduce CADE 2.5 (Comfy Adaptive Detail Enhancer), a sampler-level
guidance stack for SD/SDXL latent diffusion models. The central module,
ZeResFDG, unifies (i) frequency-decoupled guidance that reweights low- and
high-frequency components of the guidance signal, (ii) energy rescaling that
matches the per-sample magnitude of the guided prediction to the positive
branch, and (iii) zero-projection that removes the component parallel to the
unconditional direction. A lightweight spectral EMA with hysteresis switches
between a conservative and a detail-seeking mode as structure crystallizes
during sampling. Across SD/SDXL samplers, ZeResFDG improves sharpness, prompt
adherence, and artifact control at moderate guidance scales without any
retraining. In addition, we employ a training-free inference-time stabilizer,
QSilk Micrograin Stabilizer (quantile clamp + depth/edge-gated micro-detail
injection), which improves robustness and yields natural high-frequency
micro-texture at high resolutions with negligible overhead. For completeness we
note that the same rule is compatible with alternative parameterizations (e.g.,
velocity), which we briefly discuss in the Appendix; however, this paper
focuses on SD/SDXL latent diffusion models.

TL;DR: SCOPE是一个混合编码器框架，通过实例级路由动态选择专用编码器，相比传统堆叠编码器方法，在减少24-49%计算量的同时性能更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型多编码器方法简单堆叠编码器导致收益递减且计算成本倍增，需要更智能的编码器选择机制。

Method: 提出SCOPE框架，包含共享编码器和路由编码器池，通过轻量级路由器基于文本提示和共享视觉特征的交叉注意力动态选择最优编码器，使用双熵正则化和辅助损失训练路由器。

Result: 仅使用1个共享编码器加1个路由编码器的SCOPE模型，性能优于同时使用所有4个额外编码器的模型，同时减少24-49%的计算量。

Conclusion: 智能编码器选择优于暴力聚合方法，挑战了多编码器视觉语言模型的现有范式。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) benefit from multiple vision encoders, but
naively stacking them yields diminishing returns while multiplying inference
costs. We propose SCOPE, a Mixture-of-Encoders (MoEnc) framework that
dynamically selects one specialized encoder per image-text pair via
instance-level routing, unlike token-level routing in traditional MoE. SCOPE
maintains a shared encoder and a pool of routed encoders. A lightweight router
uses cross-attention between text prompts and shared visual features to select
the optimal encoder from the routed encoders. To train this router, we
introduce dual entropy regularization with auxiliary losses to balance
dataset-level load distribution with instance-level routing confidence.
Remarkably, SCOPE with one shared plus one routed encoder outperforms models
using all four extra encoders simultaneously, while reducing compute by
24-49\%. This demonstrates that intelligent encoder selection beats brute-force
aggregation, challenging the prevailing paradigm in multi-encoder VLMs.

TL;DR: 提出SVAG任务，需要同时检测、跟踪和时间定位视频中基于自然语言动作描述的所有参考对象，并构建了SVAG-Bench基准和SVAGFormer基线框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频理解方法主要处理粗粒度动作识别或通用对象跟踪，忽略了根据动作联合检测和跟踪多个对象并进行时间定位的挑战。

Method: 提出SVAGFormer基线框架，适配最先进的视觉语言模型进行联合空间和时间定位，并开发SVAGEval标准化评估工具包。

Result: 实证结果显示现有模型在SVAG任务上表现不佳，特别是在密集或复杂场景中。

Conclusion: 需要在长视频中对细粒度对象-动作交互进行更高级的推理。

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained actions and accurately localizing their
corresponding actors in space and time are fundamental capabilities for
advancing next-generation AI systems, including embodied agents, autonomous
platforms, and human-AI interaction frameworks. Despite recent progress in
video understanding, existing methods predominantly address either
coarse-grained action recognition or generic object tracking, thereby
overlooking the challenge of jointly detecting and tracking multiple objects
according to their actions while grounding them temporally. To address this
gap, we introduce Spatio-temporal Video Action Grounding (SVAG), a novel task
that requires models to simultaneously detect, track, and temporally localize
all referent objects in videos based on natural language descriptions of their
actions. To support this task, we construct SVAG-Bench, a large-scale benchmark
comprising 688 videos, 19,590 annotated records, and 903 unique verbs, covering
a diverse range of objects, actions, and real-world scenes. We further propose
SVAGFormer, a baseline framework that adapts state of the art vision language
models for joint spatial and temporal grounding, and introduce SVAGEval, a
standardized evaluation toolkit for fair and reproducible benchmarking.
Empirical results show that existing models perform poorly on SVAG,
particularly in dense or complex scenes, underscoring the need for more
advanced reasoning over fine-grained object-action interactions in long videos.

TL;DR: SeqBench是一个评估文本到视频生成中序列叙事连贯性的基准，包含320个提示的数据集和基于动态时序图的自动评估指标，揭示了当前T2V模型在维持多动作序列一致性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2V基准主要关注视觉质量指标，但缺乏对扩展序列中叙事连贯性的评估，无法衡量逻辑进展和时序关系。

Method: 构建包含320个提示的数据集，收集8个先进T2V模型生成的2560个人工标注视频，设计基于动态时序图的自动评估指标来捕捉长程依赖和时序排序。

Result: DTG指标与人工标注强相关，系统评估显示当前T2V模型在多动作序列中无法维持一致对象状态，多对象场景产生物理上不合理结果，难以保持现实时序关系。

Conclusion: SeqBench为评估T2V生成中的叙事连贯性提供了首个系统框架，为改进未来模型的序列推理能力提供了具体见解。

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation models have made significant progress in
creating visually appealing videos. However, they struggle with generating
coherent sequential narratives that require logical progression through
multiple events. Existing T2V benchmarks primarily focus on visual quality
metrics but fail to evaluate narrative coherence over extended sequences. To
bridge this gap, we present SeqBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
sequential narrative coherence in T2V generation. SeqBench includes a carefully
designed dataset of 320 prompts spanning various narrative complexities, with
2,560 human-annotated videos generated from 8 state-of-the-art T2V models.
Additionally, we design a Dynamic Temporal Graphs (DTG)-based automatic
evaluation metric, which can efficiently capture long-range dependencies and
temporal ordering while maintaining computational efficiency. Our DTG-based
metric demonstrates a strong correlation with human annotations. Through
systematic evaluation using SeqBench, we reveal critical limitations in current
T2V models: failure to maintain consistent object states across multi-action
sequences, physically implausible results in multi-object scenarios, and
difficulties in preserving realistic timing and ordering relationships between
sequential actions. SeqBench provides the first systematic framework for
evaluating narrative coherence in T2V generation and offers concrete insights
for improving sequential reasoning capabilities in future models. Please refer

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动生成方法孤立地处理运动语义或场景感知，难以构建同时包含丰富文本-运动覆盖和精确场景交互的大规模数据集。

Method: 使用运动中间帧生成作为代理任务，通过关键帧层调制运动潜在空间，并在第二阶段添加场景条件层通过交叉注意力自适应查询局部上下文来注入场景几何信息。

Result: 实验结果表明SceneAdapt有效地将场景感知注入文本到运动模型中，并分析了这种感知出现的机制。

Conclusion: SceneAdapt框架成功解决了在文本条件运动模型中注入场景感知的挑战，代码和模型将发布。

Abstract: Human motion is inherently diverse and semantically rich, while also shaped
by the surrounding scene. However, existing motion generation approaches
address either motion semantics or scene-awareness in isolation, since
constructing large-scale datasets with both rich text--motion coverage and
precise scene interactions is extremely challenging. In this work, we introduce
SceneAdapt, a framework that injects scene awareness into text-conditioned
motion models by leveraging disjoint scene--motion and text--motion datasets
through two adaptation stages: inbetweening and scene-aware inbetweening. The
key idea is to use motion inbetweening, learnable without text, as a proxy task
to bridge two distinct datasets and thereby inject scene-awareness to
text-to-motion models. In the first stage, we introduce keyframing layers that
modulate motion latents for inbetweening while preserving the latent manifold.
In the second stage, we add a scene-conditioning layer that injects scene
geometry by adaptively querying local context through cross-attention.
Experimental results show that SceneAdapt effectively injects scene awareness
into text-to-motion models, and we further analyze the mechanisms through which
this awareness emerges. Code and models will be released.

Motivation: 传统深度学习模型（如残差网络和Transformer）在处理长序列心电图信号时性能有限，需要更有效的序列建模方法。

Method: 使用卷积特征提取与Mamba选择性状态空间模型相结合的混合框架，基于Vision Mamba双向变体增强心电图数据中的时间依赖关系表示。

Result: 在十二导联心电图上，所提模型的AUPRC和AUROC分数显著高于先前发表的最佳算法。

Conclusion: 基于Mamba的架构在可靠的心电图分类方面具有潜力，支持早期诊断和个性化治疗，同时提高远程医疗和资源受限医疗系统的可及性。

Abstract: Accurate detection of cardiac abnormalities from electrocardiogram recordings
is regarded as essential for clinical diagnostics and decision support.
Traditional deep learning models such as residual networks and transformer
architectures have been applied successfully to this task, but their
performance has been limited when long sequential signals are processed.
Recently, state space models have been introduced as an efficient alternative.
In this study, a hybrid framework named One Dimensional Convolutional Neural
Network Electrocardiogram Mamba is introduced, in which convolutional feature
extraction is combined with Mamba, a selective state space model designed for
effective sequence modeling. The model is built upon Vision Mamba, a
bidirectional variant through which the representation of temporal dependencies
in electrocardiogram data is enhanced. Comprehensive experiments on the
PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenges of 2020 and 2021 were conducted,
and superior performance compared with existing methods was achieved.
Specifically, the proposed model achieved substantially higher AUPRC and AUROC
scores than those reported by the best previously published algorithms on
twelve lead electrocardiograms. These results demonstrate the potential of
Mamba-based architectures to advance reliable ECG classification. This
capability supports early diagnosis and personalized treatment, while enhancing
accessibility in telemedicine and resource-constrained healthcare systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XFactor是首个无需几何先验的自监督新视角合成模型，通过成对姿态估计和增强方案实现相机姿态与场景内容的解耦，证明了无需3D归纳偏置或SE(3)参数化即可实现真正的姿态可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督新视角合成模型的预测姿态缺乏可迁移性，同一组姿态在不同3D场景中会产生不同的相机轨迹，无法实现真正的新视角合成。

Method: 结合成对姿态估计与输入输出的简单增强方案，联合实现相机姿态与场景内容的解耦，促进几何推理，使用无约束的潜在姿态变量。

Result: XFactor显著优于先前的无姿态NVS变换器，实现了真正的姿态可迁移性，潜在姿态与现实世界姿态高度相关。

Conclusion: 无需3D归纳偏置或多视图几何概念，仅通过潜在姿态变量即可实现真正的新视角合成，为自监督学习提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: In this paper, we identify that the key criterion for determining whether a
model is truly capable of novel view synthesis (NVS) is transferability:
Whether any pose representation extracted from one video sequence can be used
to re-render the same camera trajectory in another. We analyze prior work on
self-supervised NVS and find that their predicted poses do not transfer: The
same set of poses lead to different camera trajectories in different 3D scenes.
Here, we present XFactor, the first geometry-free self-supervised model capable
of true NVS. XFactor combines pair-wise pose estimation with a simple
augmentation scheme of the inputs and outputs that jointly enables
disentangling camera pose from scene content and facilitates geometric
reasoning. Remarkably, we show that XFactor achieves transferability with
unconstrained latent pose variables, without any 3D inductive biases or
concepts from multi-view geometry -- such as an explicit parameterization of
poses as elements of SE(3). We introduce a new metric to quantify
transferability, and through large-scale experiments, we demonstrate that
XFactor significantly outperforms prior pose-free NVS transformers, and show
that latent poses are highly correlated with real-world poses through probing
experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将梯度压缩为幅值会丢失方向信息，导致监督模糊和边缘保真度不足。

Method: 引入方向感知的多尺度梯度损失，分别监督水平和垂直梯度分量，并在多尺度上保留符号信息。

Result: 在开源模型和多个公共基准测试上验证了方法的有效性，能产生更清晰、对齐更好的边缘和更丰富的纹理。

Conclusion: 该方法在不改变模型架构或训练协议的情况下，通过方向感知的梯度监督显著提升了图像融合质量。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion aims to integrate complementary information
from co-registered source images to produce a single, informative result. Most
learning-based approaches train with a combination of structural similarity
loss, intensity reconstruction loss, and a gradient-magnitude term. However,
collapsing gradients to their magnitude removes directional information,
yielding ambiguous supervision and suboptimal edge fidelity. We introduce a
direction-aware, multi-scale gradient loss that supervises horizontal and
vertical components separately and preserves their sign across scales. This
axis-wise, sign-preserving objective provides clear directional guidance at
both fine and coarse resolutions, promoting sharper, better-aligned edges and
richer texture preservation without changing model architectures or training
protocols. Experiments on open-source model and multiple public benchmarks
demonstrate effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割模型在不同数据集间部署时，由于图像外观（风格）和人群解剖特征（内容）的域偏移而表现不佳，特别是在从健康人群到痴呆患者的海马体分割中。

Method: 结合z-归一化进行风格协调，使用双向可变形图像配准网络与分割网络和判别器网络联合训练，生成解剖学上合理的变换以对齐源图像到目标域。

Result: 在合成数据集和三个MRI海马体数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有基线。从健康人群到痴呆患者的迁移中，Dice分数相对标准增强方法提高了15%，在内容偏移大的场景中效果最显著。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效实现跨不同人群的准确海马体分割，特别适用于处理显著的内容域偏移。

Abstract: Deep learning models for medical image segmentation often struggle when
deployed across different datasets due to domain shifts - variations in both
image appearance, known as style, and population-dependent anatomical
characteristics, referred to as content. This paper presents a novel
unsupervised domain adaptation framework that directly addresses domain shifts
encountered in cross-domain hippocampus segmentation from MRI, with specific
emphasis on content variations. Our approach combines efficient style
harmonisation through z-normalisation with a bidirectional deformable image
registration (DIR) strategy. The DIR network is jointly trained with
segmentation and discriminator networks to guide the registration with respect
to a region of interest and generate anatomically plausible transformations
that align source images to the target domain. We validate our approach through
comprehensive evaluations on both a synthetic dataset using Morpho-MNIST (for
controlled validation of core principles) and three MRI hippocampus datasets
representing populations with varying degrees of atrophy. Across all
experiments, our method outperforms existing baselines. For hippocampus
segmentation, when transferring from young, healthy populations to clinical
dementia patients, our framework achieves up to 15% relative improvement in
Dice score compared to standard augmentation methods, with the largest gains
observed in scenarios with substantial content shift. These results highlight
the efficacy of our approach for accurate hippocampus segmentation across
diverse populations.

Motivation: 扩散概率模型在图像生成中经常产生与现实知识冲突的幻觉样本，但缺乏系统量化这类幻觉的方法，阻碍了解决这一挑战的进展。

Method: 构建了CountHalluSet数据集套件（包括ToyShape、SimObject和RealHand），开发了标准化评估协议，系统考察了不同采样条件对计数幻觉水平的影响。

Result: 研究发现不同的采样条件（求解器类型、ODE求解器阶数、采样步数、初始噪声）会影响计数幻觉水平，且FID等常用图像质量指标无法一致地捕捉计数幻觉。

Conclusion: 这项工作为系统量化扩散模型中的幻觉现象迈出了第一步，为研究图像生成中的幻觉现象提供了新的见解和方法论基础。

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress
in generative tasks, such as image and video synthesis. However, they still
often produce hallucinated samples (hallucinations) that conflict with
real-world knowledge, such as generating an implausible duplicate cup floating
beside another cup. Despite their prevalence, the lack of feasible
methodologies for systematically quantifying such hallucinations hinders
progress in addressing this challenge and obscures potential pathways for
designing next-generation generative models under factual constraints. In this
work, we bridge this gap by focusing on a specific form of hallucination, which
we term counting hallucination, referring to the generation of an incorrect
number of instances or structured objects, such as a hand image with six
fingers, despite such patterns being absent from the training data. To this
end, we construct a dataset suite CountHalluSet, with well-defined counting
criteria, comprising ToyShape, SimObject, and RealHand. Using these datasets,
we develop a standardized evaluation protocol for quantifying counting
hallucinations, and systematically examine how different sampling conditions in
DPMs, including solver type, ODE solver order, sampling steps, and initial
noise, affect counting hallucination levels. Furthermore, we analyze their
correlation with common evaluation metrics such as FID, revealing that this
widely used image quality metric fails to capture counting hallucinations
consistently. This work aims to take the first step toward systematically
quantifying hallucinations in diffusion models and offer new insights into the
investigation of hallucination phenomena in image generation.

TL;DR: Edit-Your-Interest是一种轻量级、文本驱动的零样本视频编辑方法，通过引入时空特征记忆库和特征最相似传播技术，显著降低了计算开销，同时保持了时间一致性和视觉保真度。


<details>

Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法存在计算开销大、内存消耗高的问题，且常常牺牲视觉保真度，导致时间不一致性和伪影（如模糊和马赛克模式）。

Method: 1. 引入时空特征记忆库(SFM)缓存空间注意力处理的关键图像标记；2. 提出特征最相似传播(FMP)方法，将前一帧的最相关标记传播到后续帧；3. 设计SFM更新算法持续刷新缓存特征；4. 利用交叉注意力图自动提取感兴趣实例的掩码。

Result: 广泛实验表明，Edit-Your-Interest在效率和视觉保真度方面均优于最先进的方法，验证了其优越的有效性和实用性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过高效的时空特征管理和自动掩码提取，实现了高质量的视频编辑，同时显著降低了计算需求，为文本驱动的视频编辑提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have recently demonstrated significant
progress in video editing.
  However, existing video editing methods are severely limited by their high
computational overhead and memory consumption.
  Furthermore, these approaches often sacrifice visual fidelity, leading to
undesirable temporal inconsistencies and artifacts such as blurring and
pronounced mosaic-like patterns.
  We propose Edit-Your-Interest, a lightweight, text-driven, zero-shot video
editing method.
  Edit-Your-Interest introduces a spatio-temporal feature memory to cache
features from previous frames, significantly reducing computational overhead
compared to full-sequence spatio-temporal modeling approaches.
  Specifically, we first introduce a Spatio-Temporal Feature Memory bank (SFM),
which is designed to efficiently cache and retain the crucial image tokens
processed by spatial attention.
  Second, we propose the Feature Most-Similar Propagation (FMP) method. FMP
propagates the most relevant tokens from previous frames to subsequent ones,
preserving temporal consistency.
  Finally, we introduce an SFM update algorithm that continuously refreshes the
cached features, ensuring their long-term relevance and effectiveness
throughout the video sequence.
  Furthermore, we leverage cross-attention maps to automatically extract masks
for the instances of interest.
  These masks are seamlessly integrated into the diffusion denoising process,
enabling fine-grained control over target objects and allowing
Edit-Your-Interest to perform highly accurate edits while robustly preserving
the background integrity.
  Extensive experiments decisively demonstrate that the proposed
Edit-Your-Interest outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and
visual fidelity, validating its superior effectiveness and practicality.

for AI that understands human social dynamics from an egocentric perspective.
However, current LLMs often lack the social awareness to discern when to
intervene as AI assistant. This leads to constant, socially unaware responses
that may disrupt natural conversation and negatively impact user focus. To
address these limitations, we introduce EgoSocial, a large-scale egocentric
dataset with 13,500 social video-question pairs, specifically designed to
benchmark intervention in social interaction perception. We also present an
in-depth analysis of current omnimodal LLMs (OLLMs) to assess their
effectiveness in detecting diverse social contextual cues. Experiments show
that OLLMs still struggle to detect the intervention timing (14.4% for Gemini
2.5 Pro). We also propose EgoSoD (EgoSocial Detection), an end-to-end method
for robustly discerning social dynamics. Informed by our OLLM analysis, EgoSoD
integrates multimodal contextual cues (e.g., audio and visual cues) into a
social thinking graph, dynamically modeling participants and interactions. Our
method proactively detects intervention timing and social interactions,
precisely determining when to intervene. Our EgoSoD improves Phi-4 by 45.6% and
Gemini 2.5 Pro by 9.9% on Intervention Timing performance, and improves Phi-4
by 20.4% and Gemini 2.5 Pro by 6.9% on overall Social Interaction performance.
We will release the dataset and code soon.

Abstract: Benchmarking autonomous driving planners to align with human judgment remains
a critical challenge, as state-of-the-art metrics like the Extended Predictive
Driver Model Score (EPDMS) lack context awareness in nuanced scenarios. To
address this, we introduce DriveCritic, a novel framework featuring two key
contributions: the DriveCritic dataset, a curated collection of challenging
scenarios where context is critical for correct judgment and annotated with
pairwise human preferences, and the DriveCritic model, a Vision-Language Model
(VLM) based evaluator. Fine-tuned using a two-stage supervised and
reinforcement learning pipeline, the DriveCritic model learns to adjudicate
between trajectory pairs by integrating visual and symbolic context.
Experiments show DriveCritic significantly outperforms existing metrics and
baselines in matching human preferences and demonstrates strong context
awareness. Overall, our work provides a more reliable, human-aligned foundation
to evaluating autonomous driving systems.

Motivation: 改进现有的网格生成和微分同胚图像配准方法，确保配准变换的质量，提供精确的逆变换，这对神经影像工作流程至关重要。

Method: 使用变分原理(VP)生成具有规定雅可比行列度和旋度的非折叠网格，在微分同胚群中生成逆变换而非图像空间操作。

Result: 在OASIS-1数据集的150个脑部扫描配准中，VPreg在35个感兴趣区域的Dice分数、变换规律性以及逆映射的准确性和一致性方面优于ANTs-SyN、Freesurfer-Easyreg和FSL-Fnirt。

Conclusion: VPreg在配准精度、变换质量和逆变换准确性方面优于现有最先进方法，为计算解剖学和形态测量学提供了可靠的微分同胚空间变换。

Abstract: This paper introduces VPreg, a novel diffeomorphic image registration method.
This work provides several improvements to our past work on mesh generation and
diffeomorphic image registration. VPreg aims to achieve excellent registration
accuracy while controlling the quality of the registration transformations. It
ensures a positive Jacobian determinant of the spatial transformation and
provides an accurate approximation of the inverse of the registration, a
crucial property for many neuroimaging workflows. Unlike conventional methods,
VPreg generates this inverse transformation within the group of diffeomorphisms
rather than operating on the image space. The core of VPreg is a grid
generation approach, referred to as \emph{Variational Principle} (VP), which
constructs non-folding grids with prescribed Jacobian determinant and curl.
These VP-generated grids guarantee diffeomorphic spatial transformations
essential for computational anatomy and morphometry, and provide a more
accurate inverse than existing methods. To assess the potential of the proposed
approach, we conduct a performance analysis for 150 registrations of brain
scans from the OASIS-1 dataset. Performance evaluation based on Dice scores for
35 regions of interest, along with an empirical analysis of the properties of
the computed spatial transformations, demonstrates that VPreg outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of Dice scores, regularity properties of the
computed transformation, and accuracy and consistency of the provided inverse
map. We compare our results to ANTs-SyN, Freesurfer-Easyreg, and FSL-Fnirt.

Motivation: 解决图文跨模态检索中由于信息熵差异导致的检索不平衡问题，利用LLM的开放语义知识来填补熵差，模拟人类的对齐能力。

Method: 1) 设计不依赖任务领域显式知识的提示模板，使用LLM增强文本多义性描述；2) 使用超图适配器构建文本和图像模态间的多边连接，在固定嵌入空间中修正同义语义的正负匹配误差。

Conclusion: 提出的开放语义超图适配器有效解决了跨模态检索中的信息熵不平衡问题，显著提升了图文对齐和检索性能。

Abstract: Text-image alignment constitutes a foundational challenge in multimedia
content understanding, where effective modeling of cross-modal semantic
correspondences critically enhances retrieval system performance through joint
embedding space optimization. Given the inherent difference in information
entropy between texts and images, conventional approaches often show an
imbalance in the mutual retrieval of these two modalities. To address this
particular challenge, we propose to use the open semantic knowledge of Large
Language Model (LLM) to fill for the entropy gap and reproduce the alignment
ability of humans in these tasks. Our entropy-enhancing alignment is achieved
through a two-step process: 1) a new prompt template that does not rely on
explicit knowledge in the task domain is designed to use LLM to enhance the
polysemy description of the text modality. By analogy, the information entropy
of the text modality relative to the visual modality is increased; 2) A
hypergraph adapter is used to construct multilateral connections between the
text and image modalities, which can correct the positive and negative matching
errors for synonymous semantics in the same fixed embedding space, whilst
reducing the noise caused by open semantic entropy by mapping the reduced
dimensions back to the original dimensions. Comprehensive evaluations on the
Flickr30K and MS-COCO benchmarks validate the superiority of our Open Semantic
Hypergraph Adapter (OS-HGAdapter), showcasing 16.8\% (text-to-image) and 40.1\%
(image-to-text) cross-modal retrieval gains over existing methods while
establishing new state-of-the-art performance in semantic alignment tasks.

Abstract: This study investigates the performance of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks
(3D CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for real-time American
Sign Language (ASL) recognition. Though 3D CNNs are good at spatiotemporal
feature extraction from video sequences, LSTMs are optimized for modeling
temporal dependencies in sequential data. We evaluate both architectures on a
dataset containing 1,200 ASL signs across 50 classes, comparing their accuracy,
computational efficiency, and latency under similar training conditions.
Experimental results demonstrate that 3D CNNs achieve 92.4% recognition
accuracy but require 3.2% more processing time per frame compared to LSTMs,
which maintain 86.7% accuracy with significantly lower resource consumption.
The hybrid 3D CNNLSTM model shows decent performance, which suggests that
context-dependent architecture selection is crucial for practical
implementation.This project provides professional benchmarks for developing
assistive technologies, highlighting trade-offs between recognition precision
and real-time operational requirements in edge computing environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习降噪模型大多在模拟或单一真实场景数据上训练，忽略了不同地理区域噪声特性的显著差异，导致模型在新环境中性能下降。

Method: 使用字典学习将TEM信号的固有物理特性（如指数衰减和平滑性）编码为字典驱动先验，在训练时集成到DTEMDNet网络中，在测试时通过最小化字典驱动一致性和信号一阶变化的自监督损失来动态适应新环境。

Result: 大量实验结果表明，该方法在TEM降噪性能和测试时自适应方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 利用TEM信号的固有物理特性作为先验知识，通过测试时自适应策略可以有效提升模型在新地理环境中的降噪性能。

Abstract: Transient Electromagnetic (TEM) method is widely used in various geophysical
applications, providing valuable insights into subsurface properties. However,
time-domain TEM signals are often submerged in various types of noise. While
recent deep learning-based denoising models have shown strong performance,
these models are mostly trained on simulated or single real-world scenario
data, overlooking the significant differences in noise characteristics from
different geographical regions. Intuitively, models trained in one environment
often struggle to perform well in new settings due to differences in geological
conditions, equipment, and external interference, leading to reduced denoising
performance. To this end, we propose the Dictionary-driven Prior Regularization
Test-time Adaptation (DP-TTA). Our key insight is that TEM signals possess
intrinsic physical characteristics, such as exponential decay and smoothness,
which remain consistent across different regions regardless of external
conditions. These intrinsic characteristics serve as ideal prior knowledge for
guiding the TTA strategy, which helps the pre-trained model dynamically adjust
parameters by utilizing self-supervised losses, improving denoising performance
in new scenarios. To implement this, we customized a network, named DTEMDNet.
Specifically, we first use dictionary learning to encode these intrinsic
characteristics as a dictionary-driven prior, which is integrated into the
model during training. At the testing stage, this prior guides the model to
adapt dynamically to new environments by minimizing self-supervised losses
derived from the dictionary-driven consistency and the signal one-order
variation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves much better performance than existing TEM denoising methods and TTA
methods.

TL;DR: 提出了STT-GS策略，通过两阶段采样传输机制解决边缘高斯泼溅中的资源分配问题，优先向更有价值的客户端分配通信资源以最大化重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统边缘资源管理方法关注通信吞吐量或通用学习性能，不适用于专门优化高斯泼溅质量的场景。需要设计针对GS质量的优化目标函数，但评估该函数又需要客户端图像，形成因果困境。

Method: 提出STT-GS策略：1）第一阶段从每个客户端采样图像作为导频数据进行损失预测；2）基于评估结果优先向更有价值的客户端分配通信资源；3）使用特征域聚类选择代表性数据，采用导频传输时间最小化减少开销；4）开发联合客户端选择和功率控制框架，使用惩罚交替主化最小化算法求解。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，所提方案显著优于现有基准方法。GS导向目标函数可以在低采样率（如10%）下准确预测，方法在视图贡献和通信成本之间实现了良好平衡。

Conclusion: STT-GS策略有效解决了边缘高斯泼溅中的资源分配问题，通过智能采样和优先级分配机制，在保证重建质量的同时优化了通信资源利用。

Abstract: Edge Gaussian splatting (EGS), which aggregates data from distributed clients
and trains a global GS model at the edge server, is an emerging paradigm for
scene reconstruction. Unlike traditional edge resource management methods that
emphasize communication throughput or general-purpose learning performance, EGS
explicitly aims to maximize the GS qualities, rendering existing approaches
inapplicable. To address this problem, this paper formulates a novel
GS-oriented objective function that distinguishes the heterogeneous view
contributions of different clients. However, evaluating this function in turn
requires clients' images, leading to a causality dilemma. To this end, this
paper further proposes a sample-then-transmit EGS (or STT-GS for short)
strategy, which first samples a subset of images as pilot data from each client
for loss prediction. Based on the first-stage evaluation, communication
resources are then prioritized towards more valuable clients. To achieve
efficient sampling, a feature-domain clustering (FDC) scheme is proposed to
select the most representative data and pilot transmission time minimization
(PTTM) is adopted to reduce the pilot overhead.Subsequently, we develop a joint
client selection and power control (JCSPC) framework to maximize the
GS-oriented function under communication resource constraints. Despite the
nonconvexity of the problem, we propose a low-complexity efficient solution
based on the penalty alternating majorization minimization (PAMM) algorithm.
Experiments unveil that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms existing
benchmarks on real-world datasets. It is found that the GS-oriented objective
can be accurately predicted with low sampling ratios (e.g.,10%), and our method
achieves an excellent tradeoff between view contributions and communication
costs.

Abstract: Camera-based occupancy prediction is a mainstream approach for 3D perception
in autonomous driving, aiming to infer complete 3D scene geometry and semantics
from 2D images. Almost existing methods focus on improving performance through
structural modifications, such as lightweight backbones and complex cascaded
frameworks, with good yet limited performance. Few studies explore from the
perspective of representation fusion, leaving the rich diversity of features in
2D images underutilized. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{CIGOcc, a
two-stage occupancy prediction framework based on multi-level representation
fusion. \textbf{CIGOcc extracts segmentation, graphics, and depth features from
an input image and introduces a deformable multi-level fusion mechanism to fuse
these three multi-level features. Additionally, CIGOcc incorporates knowledge
distilled from SAM to further enhance prediction accuracy. Without increasing
training costs, CIGOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
SemanticKITTI benchmark. The code is provided in the supplementary material and

Abstract: The rapid growth of AI conferences is straining an already fragile
peer-review system, leading to heavy reviewer workloads, expertise mismatches,
inconsistent evaluation standards, superficial or templated reviews, and
limited accountability under compressed timelines. In response, conference
organizers have introduced new policies and interventions to preserve review
standards. Yet these ad-hoc changes often create further concerns and confusion
about the review process, leaving how papers are ultimately accepted - and how
practices evolve across years - largely opaque. We present Paper Copilot, a
system that creates durable digital archives of peer reviews across a wide
range of computer-science venues, an open dataset that enables researchers to
study peer review at scale, and a large-scale empirical analysis of ICLR
reviews spanning multiple years. By releasing both the infrastructure and the
dataset, Paper Copilot supports reproducible research on the evolution of peer
review. We hope these resources help the community track changes, diagnose
failure modes, and inform evidence-based improvements toward a more robust,
transparent, and reliable peer-review system.

Motivation: 当前方法在语音驱动的3D人体运动生成中存在两个主要问题：一是风格编码过于简化或忽略区域差异，二是未能动态适应语音节奏和情感变化，限制了运动的真实感。

Method: 将人体划分为不同区域进行局部运动风格编码，使用分区注意力机制让节奏和情感线索精确指导每个身体区域，通过分区风格注入和分区去噪网络实现精细控制。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法优于现有方法，能够生成更自然和富有表现力的3D人体运动序列。

Conclusion: MimicParts框架通过分区风格编码和动态适应机制，显著提升了语音驱动3D人体运动的真实感和表现力。

Abstract: Generating stylized 3D human motion from speech signals presents substantial
challenges, primarily due to the intricate and fine-grained relationships among
speech signals, individual styles, and the corresponding body movements.
Current style encoding approaches either oversimplify stylistic diversity or
ignore regional motion style differences (e.g., upper vs. lower body), limiting
motion realism. Additionally, motion style should dynamically adapt to changes
in speech rhythm and emotion, but existing methods often overlook this. To
address these issues, we propose MimicParts, a novel framework designed to
enhance stylized motion generation based on part-aware style injection and
part-aware denoising network. It divides the body into different regions to
encode localized motion styles, enabling the model to capture fine-grained
regional differences. Furthermore, our part-aware attention block allows rhythm
and emotion cues to guide each body region precisely, ensuring that the
generated motion aligns with variations in speech rhythm and emotional state.
Experimental results show that our method outperforming existing methods
showcasing naturalness and expressive 3D human motion sequences.

Abstract: In computer vision, Visual Prompting (VP) and Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) have
recently emerged as lightweight and effective alternatives to full fine-tuning
for adapting large-scale vision models within the ``pretrain-then-finetune''
paradigm. However, despite rapid progress, their conceptual boundaries remain
blurred, as VP and VPT are frequently used interchangeably in current research,
reflecting a lack of systematic distinction between these techniques and their
respective applications. In this survey, we revisit the designs of VP and VPT
from first principles, and conceptualize them within a unified framework termed
Prompt-based Adaptation (PA). We provide a taxonomy that categorizes existing
methods into learnable, generative, and non-learnable prompts, and further
organizes them by injection granularity -- pixel-level and token-level. Beyond
the core methodologies, we examine PA's integrations across diverse domains,
including medical imaging, 3D point clouds, and vision-language tasks, as well
as its role in test-time adaptation and trustworthy AI. We also summarize
current benchmarks and identify key challenges and future directions. To the
best of our knowledge, we are the first comprehensive survey dedicated to PA's
methodologies and applications in light of their distinct characteristics. Our
survey aims to provide a clear roadmap for researchers and practitioners in all
area to understand and explore the evolving landscape of PA-related research.

Conclusion: 提出的样本中心多任务学习框架和评估套件有效解决了工业缺陷检测中优化目标与质量控制决策粒度不匹配的问题，提高了检测系统的实际部署价值。

Abstract: Industrial surface defect inspection for sample-wise quality control (QC)
must simultaneously decide whether a given sample contains defects and localize
those defects spatially. In real production lines, extreme
foreground-background imbalance, defect sparsity with a long-tailed scale
distribution, and low contrast are common. As a result, pixel-centric training
and evaluation are easily dominated by large homogeneous regions, making it
difficult to drive models to attend to small or low-contrast defects-one of the
main bottlenecks for deployment. Empirically, existing models achieve strong
pixel-overlap metrics (e.g., mIoU) but exhibit insufficient stability at the
sample level, especially for sparse or slender defects. The root cause is a
mismatch between the optimization objective and the granularity of QC
decisions. To address this, we propose a sample-centric multi-task learning
framework and evaluation suite. Built on a shared-encoder architecture, the
method jointly learns sample-level defect classification and pixel-level mask
localization. Sample-level supervision modulates the feature distribution and,
at the gradient level, continually boosts recall for small and low-contrast
defects, while the segmentation branch preserves boundary and shape details to
enhance per-sample decision stability and reduce misses. For evaluation, we
propose decision-linked metrics, Seg_mIoU and Seg_Recall, which remove the bias
of classical mIoU caused by empty or true-negative samples and tightly couple
localization quality with sample-level decisions. Experiments on two benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially improves the reliability
of sample-level decisions and the completeness of defect localization.

Conclusion: 这项工作在解决实际检测应用中的否定理解问题上迈出了关键一步，为视觉语言模型提供了更可靠的否定理解能力。

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) suffer from a critical failure
in understanding negation, often referred to as affirmative bias. This
limitation is particularly severe in described object detection (DOD) tasks. To
address this, we propose two primary contributions: (1) a new dataset pipeline
and (2) a novel, lightweight adaptation recipe. First, we introduce CoVAND, a
dataset constructed with a systematic chain-of-thought (CoT) and VQA-based
pipeline to generate high-quality, instance-grounded negation data. Second, we
propose NegToMe, a novel text token merging module that directly tackles the
architectural cause of affirmative bias. NegToMe fundamentally addresses the
structural loss of negation cues in tokenization, grouping them with attributes
into coherent semantic phrases. It maintains correct polarity at the input
level, enabling robust negation understanding even with limited data. For
instance, to prevent a model from treating the fragmented tokens "not" and
"girl" as simply "girl", NegToMe binds them into a single token whose meaning
is correctly distinguished from that of "girl" alone. This module is integrated
with a parameter-efficient and strategic LoRA fine-tuning approach. Our method
significantly improves performance on challenging negation benchmarks with a
lowered false positive rate, boosting NMS-AP by up to +10.8 points on OVDEval
and demonstrating generalization to SoTA VLMs. This work marks a crucial step
forward in addressing negation understanding for real-world detection
applications.

*Yinglong Yan,Jun Yue,Shaobo Xia,Hanmeng Sun,Tianxu Ying,Chengcheng Wu,Sifan Lan,Min He,Pedram Ghamisi,Leyuan Fang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniVector是一个统一的矢量提取框架，能够在单个模型中提取多种矢量类型（多边形、折线、线段），通过实例-几何交互实现跨级别上下文交换，并在多结构矢量提取任务中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有矢量提取方法通常针对单一矢量类型设计，需要为不同结构使用单独模型，这限制了捕捉复杂结构的能力。受人类视觉感知中语义和空间交互同时使用的启发，需要开发统一框架来处理多种矢量类型。

Method: UniVector将矢量编码为包含实例级和几何级信息的结构化查询，通过交互模块迭代更新实现跨级别上下文交换，并使用动态形状约束来优化全局结构和关键点。

Result: 实验表明UniVector在单结构和多结构矢量提取任务中都达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: UniVector通过统一的实例-几何交互框架，成功实现了在单个模型中提取多种矢量类型，为矢量提取领域提供了更通用和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vector extraction retrieves structured vector geometry from raster images,
offering high-fidelity representation and broad applicability. Existing
methods, however, are usually tailored to a single vector type (e.g., polygons,
polylines, line segments), requiring separate models for different structures.
This stems from treating instance attributes (category, structure) and
geometric attributes (point coordinates, connections) independently, limiting
the ability to capture complex structures. Inspired by the human brain's
simultaneous use of semantic and spatial interactions in visual perception, we
propose UniVector, a unified VE framework that leverages instance-geometry
interaction to extract multiple vector types within a single model. UniVector
encodes vectors as structured queries containing both instance- and
geometry-level information, and iteratively updates them through an interaction
module for cross-level context exchange. A dynamic shape constraint further
refines global structures and key points. To benchmark multi-structure
scenarios, we introduce the Multi-Vector dataset with diverse polygons,
polylines, and line segments. Experiments show UniVector sets a new state of
the art on both single- and multi-structure VE tasks. Code and dataset will be
released at https://github.com/yyyyll0ss/UniVector.

TL;DR: EPIPTrack是一个统一的多模态视觉语言跟踪框架，通过显式和隐式提示进行动态目标建模和语义对齐，在多个跟踪数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大型语言模型的静态文本描述，缺乏对实时目标状态变化的适应性且容易产生幻觉，需要更灵活的多模态跟踪方法。

Method: 使用显式提示将空间运动信息转换为自然语言描述提供时空指导，隐式提示结合伪词和可学习描述符构建个性化知识表示，通过CLIP文本编码器动态调整，并设计判别性特征增强器提升视觉和跨模态表示。

Result: 在MOT17、MOT20和DanceTrack数据集上的大量实验表明，EPIPTrack在不同场景下优于现有跟踪器，展现出强大的适应性和优越性能。

Conclusion: EPIPTrack通过动态多模态提示有效解决了目标跟踪中的语义对齐问题，为实时目标状态变化提供了鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal semantic cues, such as textual descriptions, have shown strong
potential in enhancing target perception for tracking. However, existing
methods rely on static textual descriptions from large language models, which
lack adaptability to real-time target state changes and prone to
hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose a unified multimodal
vision-language tracking framework, named EPIPTrack, which leverages explicit
and implicit prompts for dynamic target modeling and semantic alignment.
Specifically, explicit prompts transform spatial motion information into
natural language descriptions to provide spatiotemporal guidance. Implicit
prompts combine pseudo-words with learnable descriptors to construct
individualized knowledge representations capturing appearance attributes. Both
prompts undergo dynamic adjustment via the CLIP text encoder to respond to
changes in target state. Furthermore, we design a Discriminative Feature
Augmentor to enhance visual and cross-modal representations. Extensive
experiments on MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack demonstrate that EPIPTrack
outperforms existing trackers in diverse scenarios, exhibiting robust
adaptability and superior performance.

TL;DR: 提出了针对视觉-语言-动作(VLA)模型的对抗性补丁攻击(EDPA)和相应的防御策略。EDPA是一种模型无关的攻击方法，通过破坏视觉和文本潜在表示的语义对齐来干扰VLA模型。同时提出了对抗性微调防御方案来缓解这种攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管VLA模型在机器人学习中取得了革命性进展，但其对抗鲁棒性仍未得到充分探索。本研究旨在填补这一空白，研究VLA模型的对抗脆弱性并提出防御方案。

Method: 提出了EDPA攻击方法，通过优化两个目标：(i)破坏视觉和文本潜在表示的语义对齐；(ii)最大化对抗性和干净视觉输入之间潜在表示的差异。同时提出了对视觉编码器进行对抗性微调的防御策略。

Result: 在LIBERO机器人仿真基准测试上的广泛评估表明，EDPA显著提高了最先进VLA模型的任务失败率，而提出的防御策略有效缓解了这种性能下降。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了VLA模型在对抗攻击面前的脆弱性，并提出了有效的攻击和防御方法，为提升VLA模型的鲁棒性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved revolutionary progress in
robot learning, enabling robots to execute complex physical robot tasks from
natural language instructions. Despite this progress, their adversarial
robustness remains underexplored. In this work, we propose both adversarial
patch attack and corresponding defense strategies for VLA models. We first
introduce the Embedding Disruption Patch Attack (EDPA), a model-agnostic
adversarial attack that generates patches directly placeable within the
camera's view. In comparison to prior methods, EDPA can be readily applied to
different VLA models without requiring prior knowledge of the model
architecture, or the controlled robotic manipulator. EDPA constructs these
patches by (i) disrupting the semantic alignment between visual and textual
latent representations, and (ii) maximizing the discrepancy of latent
representations between adversarial and corresponding clean visual inputs.
Through the optimization of these objectives, EDPA distorts the VLA's
interpretation of visual information, causing the model to repeatedly generate
incorrect actions and ultimately result in failure to complete the given
robotic task. To counter this, we propose an adversarial fine-tuning scheme for
the visual encoder, in which the encoder is optimized to produce similar latent
representations for both clean and adversarially perturbed visual inputs.
Extensive evaluations on the widely recognized LIBERO robotic simulation
benchmark demonstrate that EDPA substantially increases the task failure rate
of cutting-edge VLA models, while our proposed defense effectively mitigates
this degradation. The codebase is accessible via the homepage at
https://edpa-attack.github.io/.

Abstract: The development of computer vision algorithms for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
(UAV) applications in urban environments heavily relies on the availability of
large-scale datasets with accurate annotations. However, collecting and
annotating real-world UAV data is extremely challenging and costly. To address
this limitation, we present FlyAwareV2, a novel multimodal dataset encompassing
both real and synthetic UAV imagery tailored for urban scene understanding
tasks. Building upon the recently introduced SynDrone and FlyAware datasets,
FlyAwareV2 introduces several new key contributions: 1) Multimodal data (RGB,
depth, semantic labels) across diverse environmental conditions including
varying weather and daytime; 2) Depth maps for real samples computed via
state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation; 3) Benchmarks for RGB and
multimodal semantic segmentation on standard architectures; 4) Studies on
synthetic-to-real domain adaptation to assess the generalization capabilities
of models trained on the synthetic data. With its rich set of annotations and
environmental diversity, FlyAwareV2 provides a valuable resource for research
on UAV-based 3D urban scene understanding.

Method: 提出了Cylinder Mamba Diffusion (CymbaDiff)方法，通过施加结构化空间排序、显式捕捉圆柱连续性和垂直层次结构，保持生成场景中的物理邻域关系和全局上下文。

Result: 在SketchSem3D上的广泛实验表明，CymbaDiff在语义一致性、空间真实性和跨数据集泛化方面实现了优越性能。

Conclusion: SketchSem3D基准和CymbaDiff方法为户外3D语义场景生成提供了标准化评估和有效解决方案，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Outdoor 3D semantic scene generation produces realistic and semantically rich
environments for applications such as urban simulation and autonomous driving.
However, advances in this direction are constrained by the absence of publicly
available, well-annotated datasets. We introduce SketchSem3D, the first
large-scale benchmark for generating 3D outdoor semantic scenes from abstract
freehand sketches and pseudo-labeled annotations of satellite images.
SketchSem3D includes two subsets, Sketch-based SemanticKITTI and Sketch-based
KITTI-360 (containing LiDAR voxels along with their corresponding sketches and
annotated satellite images), to enable standardized, rigorous, and diverse
evaluations. We also propose Cylinder Mamba Diffusion (CymbaDiff) that
significantly enhances spatial coherence in outdoor 3D scene generation.
CymbaDiff imposes structured spatial ordering, explicitly captures cylindrical
continuity and vertical hierarchy, and preserves both physical neighborhood
relationships and global context within the generated scenes. Extensive
experiments on SketchSem3D demonstrate that CymbaDiff achieves superior
semantic consistency, spatial realism, and cross-dataset generalization. The
code and dataset will be available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种具有stem-encoder-decoder结构的超实时人群计数模型，在嵌入式系统上实现了最快推理速度，同时保持竞争力精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人群计数方法在嵌入式系统实际应用中存在模型参数过多、计算复杂等问题，而嵌入式系统应用要求模型具有实时性。

Method: 使用stem网络中的大卷积核扩大感受野提取头部细节信息；在编码器部分使用条件通道加权和多分支局部融合块以低计算消耗融合多尺度特征；在编码器顶部添加特征金字塔网络缓解不完全融合问题。

Result: 在三个基准测试上的实验表明，该网络在NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti上达到381.7 FPS，在NVIDIA Jetson TX1上达到71.9 FPS，推理速度最快。

Conclusion: 该网络适用于嵌入式系统上的超实时人群计数，在保证竞争力精度的同时实现了最快的推理速度。

Abstract: Crowd counting is a task of estimating the number of the crowd through
images, which is extremely valuable in the fields of intelligent security,
urban planning, public safety management, and so on. However, the existing
counting methods have some problems in practical application on embedded
systems for these fields, such as excessive model parameters, abundant complex
calculations, etc. The practical application of embedded systems requires the
model to be real-time, which means that the model is fast enough. Considering
the aforementioned problems, we design a super real-time model with a
stem-encoder-decoder structure for crowd counting tasks, which achieves the
fastest inference compared with state-of-the-arts. Firstly, large convolution
kernels in the stem network are used to enlarge the receptive field, which
effectively extracts detailed head information. Then, in the encoder part, we
use conditional channel weighting and multi-branch local fusion block to merge
multi-scale features with low computational consumption. This part is crucial
to the super real-time performance of the model. Finally, the feature pyramid
networks are added to the top of the encoder to alleviate its incomplete fusion
problems. Experiments on three benchmarks show that our network is suitable for
super real-time crowd counting on embedded systems, ensuring competitive
accuracy. At the same time, the proposed network reasoning speed is the
fastest. Specifically, the proposed network achieves 381.7 FPS on NVIDIA GTX
1080Ti and 71.9 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson TX1.

Motivation: 尽管视频大语言模型在视频问答任务上取得进展，但其内部如何提取和传播视频与文本信息的机制仍不明确，需要深入探索。

Method: 使用机制可解释性技术分析VideoLLMs的内部信息流，研究不同层级的跨帧交互和视频-语言整合模式。

Result: 发现一致的时序推理模式：早期到中间层进行跨帧交互，中间层实现视频-语言整合，中后期层生成答案。通过选择有效信息路径可减少58%注意力边而保持性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了VideoLLMs进行时序推理的机制，为改进模型可解释性和下游泛化提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) extend the capabilities of
vision-language models to spatiotemporal inputs, enabling tasks such as video
question answering (VideoQA). Despite recent advances in VideoLLMs, their
internal mechanisms on where and how they extract and propagate video and
textual information remain less explored. In this study, we investigate the
internal information flow of VideoLLMs using mechanistic interpretability
techniques. Our analysis reveals consistent patterns across diverse VideoQA
tasks: (1) temporal reasoning in VideoLLMs initiates with active cross-frame
interactions in early-to-middle layers, (2) followed by progressive
video-language integration in middle layers. This is facilitated by alignment
between video representations and linguistic embeddings containing temporal
concepts. (3) Upon completion of this integration, the model is ready to
generate correct answers in middle-to-late layers. (4) Based on our analysis,
we show that VideoLLMs can retain their VideoQA performance by selecting these
effective information pathways while suppressing a substantial amount of
attention edges, e.g., 58% in LLaVA-NeXT-7B-Video-FT. These findings provide a
blueprint on how VideoLLMs perform temporal reasoning and offer practical
insights for improving model interpretability and downstream generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前端到端多模态模型使用不同的编码器和解码器处理输入输出信息，这种分离阻碍了多模态的联合表示学习。

Method: 使用基于Mamba的多步选择扩散模型，通过统一的变分自编码器逐步生成和精炼模态特定信息。

Conclusion: MDM有效统一了多模态处理过程，同时保持计算效率，为端到端多模态架构开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Current end-to-end multi-modal models utilize different encoders and decoders
to process input and output information. This separation hinders the joint
representation learning of various modalities. To unify multi-modal processing,
we propose a novel architecture called MDM (Multi-modal Diffusion Mamba). MDM
utilizes a Mamba-based multi-step selection diffusion model to progressively
generate and refine modality-specific information through a unified variational
autoencoder for both encoding and decoding. This innovative approach allows MDM
to achieve superior performance when processing high-dimensional data,
particularly in generating high-resolution images and extended text sequences
simultaneously. Our evaluations in areas such as image generation, image
captioning, visual question answering, text comprehension, and reasoning tasks
demonstrate that MDM significantly outperforms existing end-to-end models
(MonoFormer, LlamaGen, and Chameleon etc.) and competes effectively with SOTA
models like GPT-4V, Gemini Pro, and Mistral. Our results validate MDM's
effectiveness in unifying multi-modal processes while maintaining computational
efficiency, establishing a new direction for end-to-end multi-modal
architectures.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型的上下文窗口不断扩大，但扩展的上下文窗口并不能保证上下文的有效利用，这对实际应用构成关键挑战。当前评估主要集中在纯文本领域，多模态评估仅限于短上下文。

Method: 引入MMLongCite基准，包含8个不同任务，涵盖6个上下文长度区间，整合了文本、图像和视频等多种模态。

Result: 对最先进的大型视觉语言模型进行评估，发现它们在处理长多模态上下文时的忠实度有限。深入分析了上下文长度和关键内容位置对模型忠实度的影响。

Conclusion: 需要开发能够更好地利用长多模态上下文的模型，MMLongCite基准为此提供了评估工具和分析框架。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large vision language models (LVLMs) has led to a
significant expansion of their context windows. However, an extended context
window does not guarantee the effective utilization of the context, posing a
critical challenge for real-world applications. Current evaluations of such
long-context faithfulness are predominantly focused on the text-only domain,
while multimodal assessments remain limited to short contexts. To bridge this
gap, we introduce MMLongCite, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
the fidelity of LVLMs in long-context scenarios. MMLongCite comprises 8
distinct tasks spanning 6 context length intervals and incorporates diverse
modalities, including text, images, and videos. Our evaluation of
state-of-the-art LVLMs reveals their limited faithfulness in handling long
multimodal contexts. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of how
context length and the position of crucial content affect the faithfulness of
these models.

TL;DR: 提出MaskDCPT预训练方法，通过退化类型分类和图像重建来学习通用图像修复表示，显著提升CNN和Transformer在图像修复任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预训练方法在图像修复任务中表现有限，需要一种能够同时处理多种退化类型并具有强泛化能力的预训练方法。

Method: 使用编码器提取掩码低质量图像特征，两个解码器分别进行退化类型分类和高质量图像重建，结合掩码图像建模和对比学习。

Result: 在5D全能修复任务中PSNR至少提升3.77dB，真实场景中PIQE降低34.8%，对未见过的退化类型和程度表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: MaskDCPT提供了一种有效的图像修复预训练方法，并发布了包含250万样本的UIR-2.5M数据集，推动了通用图像修复的发展。

Abstract: This study introduces a Masked Degradation Classification Pre-Training method
(MaskDCPT), designed to facilitate the classification of degradation types in
input images, leading to comprehensive image restoration pre-training. Unlike
conventional pre-training methods, MaskDCPT uses the degradation type of the
image as an extremely weak supervision, while simultaneously leveraging the
image reconstruction to enhance performance and robustness. MaskDCPT includes
an encoder and two decoders: the encoder extracts features from the masked
low-quality input image. The classification decoder uses these features to
identify the degradation type, whereas the reconstruction decoder aims to
reconstruct a corresponding high-quality image. This design allows the
pre-training to benefit from both masked image modeling and contrastive
learning, resulting in a generalized representation suited for restoration
tasks. Benefit from the straightforward yet potent MaskDCPT, the pre-trained
encoder can be used to address universal image restoration and achieve
outstanding performance. Implementing MaskDCPT significantly improves
performance for both convolution neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, with
a minimum increase in PSNR of 3.77 dB in the 5D all-in-one restoration task and
a 34.8% reduction in PIQE compared to baseline in real-world degradation
scenarios. It also emergences strong generalization to previously unseen
degradation types and levels. In addition, we curate and release the UIR-2.5M
dataset, which includes 2.5 million paired restoration samples across 19
degradation types and over 200 degradation levels, incorporating both synthetic
and real-world data. The dataset, source code, and models are available at

(Differentiable Binarization Network Plus) detector, and text classification
[2] using a BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) classifier,
all integrated within a user interface implemented in Python with PyQt5. The
achieved results by the system for text detection in images were good at about
92.88% through 10 hours on Total-Text dataset that involve high resolution

the proposed approach is effective for practical, mixed-source document

Motivation: 解决点云分割中新类发现问题，关键在于建立点表示与基础类别标签之间的精确关联，以及基础类别和新类别之间的表示关联。统计相关性学习可能导致新类别推断混淆，需要更强的因果约束。

Method: 引入结构因果模型重新形式化3D-NCD问题，提出联合因果表示与推理学习。首先分析基础类别表示中的隐藏混杂因子，设计因果表示原型消除混杂因子，然后使用图结构建模基础类别因果表示原型与新类别原型之间的因果关系。

Result: 在3D和2D NCD语义分割上的大量实验和可视化结果证明了该方法的优越性。

Conclusion: 通过因果表示和推理方法，能够准确发现点云分割中的新类别，解决了传统统计相关性学习可能导致的混淆问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on Novel Class Discovery for Point Cloud Segmentation
(3D-NCD), aiming to learn a model that can segment unlabeled (novel) 3D classes
using only the supervision from labeled (base) 3D classes. The key to this task
is to setup the exact correlations between the point representations and their
base class labels, as well as the representation correlations between the
points from base and novel classes. A coarse or statistical correlation
learning may lead to the confusion in novel class inference. lf we impose a
causal relationship as a strong correlated constraint upon the learning
process, the essential point cloud representations that accurately correspond
to the classes should be uncovered. To this end, we introduce a structural
causal model (SCM) to re-formalize the 3D-NCD problem and propose a new method,
i.e., Joint Learning of Causal Representation and Reasoning. Specifically, we
first analyze hidden confounders in the base class representations and the
causal relationships between the base and novel classes through SCM. We devise
a causal representation prototype that eliminates confounders to capture the
causal representations of base classes. A graph structure is then used to model
the causal relationships between the base classes' causal representation
prototypes and the novel class prototypes, enabling causal reasoning from base
to novel classes. Extensive experiments and visualization results on 3D and 2D
NCD semantic segmentation demonstrate the superiorities of our method.

Conclusion: 通过充分利用GPU并行计算潜力，成功解决了SfM在大规模场景下的速度和精度权衡问题，为机器人重建和仿真提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Structure-from-Motion (SfM), a method that recovers camera poses and scene
geometry from uncalibrated images, is a central component in robotic
reconstruction and simulation. Despite the state-of-the-art performance of
traditional SfM methods such as COLMAP and its follow-up work, GLOMAP, naive
CPU-specialized implementations of bundle adjustment (BA) or global positioning
(GP) introduce significant computational overhead when handling large-scale
scenarios, leading to a trade-off between accuracy and speed in SfM. Moreover,
the blessing of efficient C++-based implementations in COLMAP and GLOMAP comes
with the curse of limited flexibility, as they lack support for various
external optimization options. On the other hand, while deep learning based SfM
pipelines like VGGSfM and VGGT enable feed-forward 3D reconstruction, they are
unable to scale to thousands of input views at once as GPU memory consumption
increases sharply as the number of input views grows. In this paper, we unleash
the full potential of GPU parallel computation to accelerate each critical
stage of the standard SfM pipeline. Building upon recent advances in
sparse-aware bundle adjustment optimization, our design extends these
techniques to accelerate both BA and GP within a unified global SfM framework.
Through extensive experiments on datasets of varying scales (e.g. 5000 images
where VGGSfM and VGGT run out of memory), our method demonstrates up to about
40 times speedup over COLMAP while achieving consistently comparable or even
improved reconstruction accuracy. Our project page can be found at

### [121] [Self-Augmented Visual Contrastive Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13315)
*Eun Woo Im,Muhammad Kashif Ali,Vivek Gupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的训练自由解码策略，通过自增强提示和自适应阈值算法来减少大型视觉语言模型的幻觉问题，显著提高了事实一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型继承了底层语言模型的幻觉倾向，现有视觉对比解码方法使用通用的视觉增强而忽略了文本查询的具体上下文，限制了其有效性。

Method: 1. 自增强提示策略：利用模型内在知识动态对齐查询和视觉增强的语义；2. 自适应阈值算法：基于输出稀疏性自适应调整下一个token候选大小，充分利用logit分布信息。

Result: 在四个LVLM和七个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，所提出的解码方法相比最先进的解码方法显著提高了事实一致性。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了整合查询依赖增强和熵感知解码对于改善LVLM有效生成的重要性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal
capabilities, but they inherit the tendency to hallucinate from their
underlying language models. While visual contrastive decoding has been proposed
to mitigate this issue, existing methods often apply generic visual
augmentations that disregard the specific context provided by the text query,
limiting their effectiveness. This study introduces a novel training-free
decoding strategy that addresses these limitations, featuring two key
contributions. First, a self-augmentation prompting strategy that leverages the
intrinsic knowledge of the model to dynamically align semantics between the
query and the visual augmentation. Second, an adaptive thresholding algorithm
that adaptively adjusts next token candidate size based on the output sparsity,
utilizing full information from the logit distribution. Extensive experiments
across four LVLMs and seven benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed decoding
significantly enhances factual consistency compared to state-of-the-art
decoding methods. This work highlights the importance of integrating
query-dependent augmentation and entropy-aware decoding for improving effective
generation of LVLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日常生活中的注意力和兴趣受到所见内容的高度影响，研究大型多模态模型是否能捕捉视觉趣味性概念，以及人类评估与模型预测之间的对齐程度。

Method: 通过比较分析人类评估与GPT-4o预测的契合度，利用模型对图像对进行趣味性标注，并将这些标注数据用于训练学习排序模型。

Result: 研究发现人类与GPT-4o在视觉趣味性评估上存在部分对齐，GPT-4o在捕捉该概念方面表现优于现有最先进方法，能够有效标注图像对的趣味性。

Conclusion: GPT-4o能够有效理解视觉趣味性概念，为深入理解人类兴趣提供了新的途径，通过知识蒸馏可以训练出有效的学习排序模型。

Abstract: Our daily life is highly influenced by what we consume and see. Attracting
and holding one's attention -- the definition of (visual) interestingness -- is
essential. The rise of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) trained on large-scale
visual and textual data has demonstrated impressive capabilities. We explore
these models' potential to understand to what extent the concepts of visual
interestingness are captured and examine the alignment between human
assessments and GPT-4o's, a leading LMM, predictions through comparative
analysis. Our studies reveal partial alignment between humans and GPT-4o. It
already captures the concept as best compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Hence, this allows for the effective labeling of image pairs according to their
(commonly) interestingness, which are used as training data to distill the
knowledge into a learning-to-rank model. The insights pave the way for a deeper
understanding of human interest.

*Simon Kiefhaber,Stefan Roth,Simone Schaub-Meyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种训练策略，允许在训练过程中移除光流估计器中的代价体积，从而显著提高推理速度和减少内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于经验观察：一旦网络其他部分充分训练后，代价体积的重要性会降低，但其计算和空间复杂度限制了处理速度和输入帧分辨率。

Method: 引入一种训练策略，在训练过程中逐步移除代价体积，创建了三种不同计算预算的模型。

Result: 最准确的模型达到最先进精度，同时比可比模型快1.2倍、内存占用低6倍；最快模型能在500MB GPU内存下以20FPS处理全高清帧。

Conclusion: 该训练策略成功实现了在保持精度的同时显著提升光流估计的推理速度和内存效率。

Abstract: Cost volumes are used in every modern optical flow estimator, but due to
their computational and space complexity, they are often a limiting factor
regarding both processing speed and the resolution of input frames. Motivated
by our empirical observation that cost volumes lose their importance once all
other network parts of, e.g., a RAFT-based pipeline have been sufficiently
trained, we introduce a training strategy that allows removing the cost volume
from optical flow estimators throughout training. This leads to significantly
improved inference speed and reduced memory requirements. Using our training
strategy, we create three different models covering different compute budgets.
Our most accurate model reaches state-of-the-art accuracy while being
$1.2\times$ faster and having a $6\times$ lower memory footprint than
comparable models; our fastest model is capable of processing Full HD frames at
$20\,\mathrm{FPS}$ using only $500\,\mathrm{MB}$ of GPU memory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐蔽武器检测技术存在分辨率低、隐私问题等限制，需要实时、低成本、保护隐私的解决方案。

Method: 基于YOLOv8改进的DEF-YOLO架构，在SPPF层使用可变形卷积提取多尺度特征，在骨干网络和颈部网络提取低中高层次特征，并引入焦点损失解决类别不平衡问题。

Result: 建立了首个大规模热成像隐蔽武器检测数据集TICW，并通过实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该工作为热成像隐蔽武器检测建立了新的基准，提供了有效的实时检测解决方案。

Abstract: Concealed weapon detection aims at detecting weapons hidden beneath a
person's clothing or luggage. Various imaging modalities like Millimeter Wave,
Microwave, Terahertz, Infrared, etc., are exploited for the concealed weapon
detection task. These imaging modalities have their own limitations, such as
poor resolution in microwave imaging, privacy concerns in millimeter wave
imaging, etc. To provide a real-time, 24 x 7 surveillance, low-cost, and
privacy-preserved solution, we opted for thermal imaging in spite of the lack
of availability of a benchmark dataset. We propose a novel approach and a
dataset for concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery. Our YOLO-based
architecture, DEF-YOLO, is built with key enhancements in YOLOv8 tailored to
the unique challenges of concealed weapon detection in thermal vision. We adopt
deformable convolutions at the SPPF layer to exploit multi-scale features;
backbone and neck layers to extract low, mid, and high-level features, enabling
DEF-YOLO to adaptively focus on localization around the objects in thermal
homogeneous regions, without sacrificing much of the speed and throughput. In
addition to these simple yet effective key architectural changes, we introduce
a new, large-scale Thermal Imaging Concealed Weapon dataset, TICW, featuring a
diverse set of concealed weapons and capturing a wide range of scenarios. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale contributed dataset
for this task. We also incorporate focal loss to address the significant class
imbalance inherent in the concealed weapon detection task. The efficacy of the
proposed work establishes a new benchmark through extensive experimentation for
concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery.

TL;DR: 提出了Group-VQ方法，通过分组优化码本解决VQ-VAE中的码本崩溃问题，提高了码本利用率和重建性能，并引入了训练后码本重采样方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VQ-VAE在自监督学习中存在码本崩溃问题，现有方法使用隐式静态码本或联合优化整个码本，但限制了码本学习能力，导致重建质量下降。

Method: 提出Group-VQ进行分组优化码本，每组独立优化，组内联合优化。还引入了训练后码本重采样方法，可在训练后调整码本大小。

Result: 在各种图像重建实验中，Group-VQ在重建指标上表现出改进的性能，训练后码本采样方法实现了调整码本大小的灵活性。

Conclusion: Group-VQ方法改善了码本利用率和重建性能之间的权衡，训练后码本重采样提供了码本大小调整的灵活性。

Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) leverage self-supervised
learning through reconstruction tasks to represent continuous vectors using the
closest vectors in a codebook. However, issues such as codebook collapse
persist in the VQ model. To address these issues, existing approaches employ
implicit static codebooks or jointly optimize the entire codebook, but these
methods constrain the codebook's learning capability, leading to reduced
reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose Group-VQ, which performs
group-wise optimization on the codebook. Each group is optimized independently,
with joint optimization performed within groups. This approach improves the
trade-off between codebook utilization and reconstruction performance.
Additionally, we introduce a training-free codebook resampling method, allowing
post-training adjustment of the codebook size. In image reconstruction
experiments under various settings, Group-VQ demonstrates improved performance
on reconstruction metrics. And the post-training codebook sampling method
achieves the desired flexibility in adjusting the codebook size.

*Sipeng Yang,Jiayu Ji,Qingchuan Zhu,Zhiyao Yang,Xiaogang Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个针对渲染视频的无参考质量评估方法和数据集，解决了现有方法在渲染视频上的偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无参考视频质量评估方法主要针对相机拍摄视频，直接应用于渲染视频会产生偏差预测，因为渲染视频更容易出现时间伪影。

Method: 创建了一个大型渲染导向的视频数据集，包含主观质量标注，并设计了专门针对渲染视频的无参考质量评估指标，同时考虑图像质量和时间稳定性。

Result: 提出的指标在渲染视频上表现出优于现有无参考质量评估方法的性能，并能用于基准测试超采样方法和评估实时渲染中的帧生成策略。

Conclusion: 该工作填补了渲染视频质量评估的空白，为计算机图形应用提供了更准确的质量评估工具。

Abstract: Quality assessment of videos is crucial for many computer graphics
applications, including video games, virtual reality, and augmented reality,
where visual performance has a significant impact on user experience. When test
videos cannot be perfectly aligned with references or when references are
unavailable, the significance of no-reference video quality assessment (NR-VQA)
methods is undeniable. However, existing NR-VQA datasets and metrics are
primarily focused on camera-captured videos; applying them directly to rendered
videos would result in biased predictions, as rendered videos are more prone to
temporal artifacts. To address this, we present a large rendering-oriented
video dataset with subjective quality annotations, as well as a designed NR-VQA
metric specific to rendered videos. The proposed dataset includes a wide range
of 3D scenes and rendering settings, with quality scores annotated for various
display types to better reflect real-world application scenarios. Building on
this dataset, we calibrate our NR-VQA metric to assess rendered video quality
by looking at both image quality and temporal stability. We compare our metric
to existing NR-VQA metrics, demonstrating its superior performance on rendered
videos. Finally, we demonstrate that our metric can be used to benchmark
supersampling methods and assess frame generation strategies in real-time
rendering.

*MingZe Tang,Jubal Chandy Jacob*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现，在视觉语言模型的零样本分类中，对于高性能模型（如MetaCLIP 2和OpenCLIP），最简单的基础提示词效果最好，增加描述性细节反而会显著降低性能，这种现象被称为"提示词过拟合"。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索提示词设计对视觉语言模型在识别视觉相似类别（如人体姿态）的零样本分类中的影响，特别是在数据稀缺条件下。

Method: 使用285张COCO数据集图像，评估OpenCLIP、MetaCLIP 2和SigLip等现代视觉语言模型，采用三级提示词设计系统性地增加语言细节。

Result: MetaCLIP 2和OpenCLIP在简单提示词下表现最佳（多类准确率68.8%），增加描述细节后准确率降至55.1%；而性能较差的SigLip模型在更详细的基于身体线索的提示词下对模糊类别分类有所改善。

Conclusion: 提示词设计对视觉语言模型的零样本分类性能有显著影响，高性能模型倾向于简单提示词，而低性能模型可能从更详细的提示词中受益，揭示了"提示词过拟合"现象。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared space, a promising approach for
data-scarce conditions. However, the influence of prompt design on recognizing
visually similar categories, such as human postures, is not well understood.
This study investigates how prompt specificity affects the zero-shot
classification of sitting, standing, and walking/running on a small, 285-image
COCO-derived dataset. A suite of modern VLMs, including OpenCLIP, MetaCLIP 2,
and SigLip, were evaluated using a three-tiered prompt design that
systematically increases linguistic detail. Our findings reveal a compelling,
counter-intuitive trend: for the highest-performing models (MetaCLIP 2 and
OpenCLIP), the simplest, most basic prompts consistently achieve the best
results. Adding descriptive detail significantly degrades performance for
instance, MetaCLIP 2's multi-class accuracy drops from 68.8\% to 55.1\% a
phenomenon we term "prompt overfitting". Conversely, the lower-performing
SigLip model shows improved classification on ambiguous classes when given more
descriptive, body-cue-based prompts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DepthVLA是一种增强空间推理能力的视觉-语言-动作模型，通过集成预训练深度预测模块来提升空间感知能力，在真实世界和模拟环境中均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLA模型在需要精确空间推理的任务上表现不佳，因为它们继承了视觉语言模型有限的空间推理能力，且依赖大量动作数据预训练来在3D空间中定位，这降低了训练效率且空间理解仍然不足。

Method: 提出DepthVLA架构，采用混合变换器设计，统一了视觉语言模型、深度变换器和动作专家，通过完全共享注意力形成端到端模型，并明确通过预训练深度预测模块融入空间感知。

Result: 在真实世界任务中达到78.5%进展（vs. 65.0%），在LIBERO模拟器中达到94.9%（vs. 93.6%），在Simpler模拟器中达到74.8%（vs. 58.8%），均优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: DepthVLA通过显式集成空间感知能力，有效提升了VLA模型的空间推理性能，在多种环境中都表现出优越的性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently shown impressive
generalization and language-guided manipulation capabilities. However, their
performance degrades on tasks requiring precise spatial reasoning due to
limited spatial reasoning inherited from Vision-Language Models (VLMs).
Existing VLAs rely on extensive action-data pretraining to ground VLMs in 3D
space, which reduces training efficiency and is still insufficient for accurate
spatial understanding. In this work, we present DepthVLA, a simple yet
effective VLA architecture that explicitly incorporates spatial awareness
through a pretrained depth prediction module. DepthVLA adopts a
mixture-of-transformers design that unifies a VLM, a depth transformer, and an
action expert with fully shared attentions, forming an end-to-end model with
enhanced spatial reasoning. Extensive evaluations in both real-world and
simulated environments show that DepthVLA outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving 78.5% vs. 65.0% progress in real-world tasks, 94.9% vs.
93.6% in the LIBERO simulator, and 74.8% vs. 58.8% in the Simpler simulator.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合SDF和3DGS的新方法，用于动态场景渲染和重建，无需LiDAR数据和3D运动标注即可在城市场景中实现最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于3DGS的动态城市场景方法需要相机和LiDAR数据、真实3D分割和运动数据，限制了应用范围。本研究探索使用2D对象无关先验（深度和点跟踪）结合SDF表示来放宽这些要求。

Method: 将符号距离函数（SDF）与3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）集成，利用两种方法的优势创建更鲁棒的对象表示。采用统一优化框架，增强3DGS的几何精度并改进SDF内的变形建模。

Result: 在城市场景中无需LiDAR数据即可在渲染指标上达到最先进性能。结合LiDAR时，能在不同对象类别上进一步改进重建和新视角生成，且无需真实3D运动标注。支持场景分解和组合等编辑任务。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合SDF和3DGS，成功放宽了对LiDAR数据和3D运动标注的依赖，在动态场景渲染和重建方面表现出色，同时支持多种场景编辑应用。

Abstract: Dynamic scene rendering and reconstruction play a crucial role in computer
vision and augmented reality. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), have enabled accurate modeling of dynamic urban scenes, but for urban
scenes they require both camera and LiDAR data, ground-truth 3D segmentations
and motion data in the form of tracklets or pre-defined object templates such
as SMPL. In this work, we explore whether a combination of 2D object agnostic
priors in the form of depth and point tracking coupled with a signed distance
function (SDF) representation for dynamic objects can be used to relax some of
these requirements. We present a novel approach that integrates Signed Distance
Functions (SDFs) with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to create a more robust
object representation by harnessing the strengths of both methods. Our unified
optimization framework enhances the geometric accuracy of 3D Gaussian splatting
and improves deformation modeling within the SDF, resulting in a more adaptable
and precise representation. We demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in rendering metrics even without LiDAR data on
urban scenes. When incorporating LiDAR, our approach improved further in
reconstructing and generating novel views across diverse object categories,
without ground-truth 3D motion annotation. Additionally, our method enables
various scene editing tasks, including scene decomposition, and scene
composition.

TL;DR: 提出GLSDA框架，利用预训练大模型的语义先验增强WiFi手势识别的泛化能力，通过双路径CSI编码、多尺度语义编码器和语义感知软监督，在保持轻量化的同时提升跨域识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有WiFi手势识别方法在泛化性和语义表达能力上的不足，特别是CSI数据的领域敏感性和缺乏高级手势抽象的问题。

Method: 采用双路径CSI编码（CSI-Ratio相位序列和多普勒频谱图）、多尺度语义编码器、语义感知软监督方案和鲁棒双蒸馏策略，将大模型语义知识蒸馏到轻量学生网络。

Result: 在Widar3.0基准测试中，GLSDA在域内和跨域手势识别任务上均优于现有最优方法，同时显著减小模型大小和推理延迟。

Conclusion: GLSDA为现实AIoT应用中的通用RF手势接口提供了可扩展和可部署的解决方案。

Abstract: WiFi-based gesture recognition has emerged as a promising RF sensing paradigm
for enabling non-contact and privacy-preserving human-computer interaction in
AIoT environments. However, existing methods often suffer from limited
generalization and semantic expressiveness due to the domain-sensitive nature
of Channel State Information and the lack of high-level gesture abstraction. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel generalization framework, termed
Large-Model-Aware Semantic Distillation and Alignment (GLSDA), which leverages
the semantic prior of pre-trained large foundation models to enhance gesture
representation learning in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios.
Specifically, we first design a dual-path CSI encoding pipeline that captures
geometric and dynamic gesture patterns via CSI-Ratio phase sequences and
Doppler spectrograms. These representations are then fed into a Multiscale
Semantic Encoder, which learns robust temporal embeddings and aligns them with
gesture semantics through cross-modal attention mechanisms. To further enhance
category discrimination, we introduce a Semantic-Aware Soft Supervision scheme
that encodes inter-class correlations and reduces label ambiguity, especially
for semantically similar gestures. Finally, we develop a Robust
Dual-Distillation strategy to compress the aligned model into a lightweight
student network, jointly distilling intermediate features and semantic-informed
soft labels from the teacher model. Extensive experiments on the Widar3.0
benchmark show that GLSDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both in-domain and cross-domain gesture recognition tasks, while significantly
reducing model size and inference latency. Our method offers a scalable and
deployable solution for generalized RF-based gesture interfaces in real-world
AIoT applications.

Motivation: 现有基准无法充分评估空间推理能力，特别是内在动态空间推理这一人类空间认知的基本方面。

Method: 基于认知分类学构建四象限分类框架，开发可扩展的自动化流水线生成多样且可验证的空间推理问题，创建包含评估集和训练集的数据集。

Result: 对28个最先进VLMs的评估显示，当前模型在空间推理能力上与人类存在显著差距，特别是在多步骤多视图空间推理方面。

Conclusion: Spatial-DISE为未来研究提供了稳健框架、有价值数据集和明确方向，推动实现类人空间智能。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning ability is crucial for Vision Language Models (VLMs) to
support real-world applications in diverse domains including robotics,
augmented reality, and autonomous navigation. Unfortunately, existing
benchmarks are inadequate in assessing spatial reasoning ability, especially
the \emph{intrinsic-dynamic} spatial reasoning which is a fundamental aspect of
human spatial cognition. In this paper, we propose a unified benchmark,
\textbf{Spatial-DISE}, based on a cognitively grounded taxonomy that
categorizes tasks into four fundamental quadrants:
\textbf{I}ntrinsic-\textbf{S}tatic, Intrinsic-\textbf{D}ynamic,
\textbf{E}xtrinsic-Static, and Extrinsic-Dynamic spatial reasoning. Moreover,
to address the issue of data scarcity, we develop a scalable and automated
pipeline to generate diverse and verifiable spatial reasoning questions,
resulting in a new \textbf{Spatial-DISE} dataset that includes Spatial-DISE
Bench (559 evaluation VQA pairs) and Spatial-DISE-12K (12K+ training VQA
pairs). Our comprehensive evaluation across 28 state-of-the-art VLMs reveals
that, current VLMs have a large and consistent gap to human competence,
especially on multi-step multi-view spatial reasoning. Spatial-DISE offers a
robust framework, valuable dataset, and clear direction for future research
toward human-like spatial intelligence. Benchmark, dataset, and code will be
publicly released.

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法主要针对扩散模型或自回归模型，而忽视了掩码生成模型这一重要替代方案。

Method: 重新定义转移概率，将去掩码过程建模为多步决策问题，采用GRPO强化学习框架，并结合移除KL约束、应用缩减策略和过滤低质量样本等优化策略。

Result: 在标准T2I基准测试和偏好对齐方面显著提升了基础模型Show-o的性能，超越了现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: Mask-GRPO成功将强化学习应用于掩码生成模型，为该范式提供了有效的优化方法，在文本到图像生成任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has garnered increasing attention in
text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, most existing RL approaches are
tailored to either diffusion models or autoregressive models, overlooking an
important alternative: masked generative models. In this work, we propose
Mask-GRPO, the first method to incorporate Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO)-based RL into this overlooked paradigm. Our core insight is to redefine
the transition probability, which is different from current approaches, and
formulate the unmasking process as a multi-step decision-making problem. To
further enhance our method, we explore several useful strategies, including
removing the KL constraint, applying the reduction strategy, and filtering out
low-quality samples. Using Mask-GRPO, we improve a base model, Show-o, with
substantial improvements on standard T2I benchmarks and preference alignment,
outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches. The code is available on

TL;DR: Patch-Adapter是一个用于高分辨率文本引导图像修复的有效框架，能够实现4K+分辨率，同时保持内容一致性和提示对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法局限于较低分辨率，随着分辨率和纹理复杂度的增加，内容一致性和提示对齐这两个关键挑战变得更加严峻。

Method: 采用两阶段适配器架构：双上下文适配器学习掩码和非掩码区域的连贯性以建立全局结构一致性；参考补丁适配器通过补丁级注意力机制实现全分辨率修复，通过自适应特征融合保持局部细节保真度。

Result: 在OpenImages和Photo-Concept-Bucket数据集上实现了最先进的性能，不仅解决了大规模修复中常见的伪影问题，而且在感知质量和文本提示遵循方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Patch-Adapter通过解耦全局语义和局部细化，独特地解决了高分辨率修复中的可扩展性差距问题。

Abstract: In this work, we present Patch-Adapter, an effective framework for
high-resolution text-guided image inpainting. Unlike existing methods limited
to lower resolutions, our approach achieves 4K+ resolution while maintaining
precise content consistency and prompt alignment, two critical challenges in
image inpainting that intensify with increasing resolution and texture
complexity. Patch-Adapter leverages a two-stage adapter architecture to scale
the diffusion model's resolution from 1K to 4K+ without requiring structural
overhauls: (1) Dual Context Adapter learns coherence between masked and
unmasked regions at reduced resolutions to establish global structural
consistency; and (2) Reference Patch Adapter implements a patch-level attention
mechanism for full-resolution inpainting, preserving local detail fidelity
through adaptive feature fusion. This dual-stage architecture uniquely
addresses the scalability gap in high-resolution inpainting by decoupling
global semantics from localized refinement. Experiments demonstrate that
Patch-Adapter not only resolves artifacts common in large-scale inpainting but
also achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenImages and
Photo-Concept-Bucket datasets, outperforming existing methods in both
perceptual quality and text-prompt adherence.

*Yushan Han,Hui Zhang,Honglei Zhang,Chuntao Ding,Yuanzhouhan Cao,Yidong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CoDS方法解决自动驾驶中异构场景下的协作感知问题，通过轻量级空间通道调整器和域分离分布对齐模块有效处理特征差异，在保证检测精度的同时提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有协作感知方法假设所有智能体使用相同编码器，不适用于实际异构场景。现有方法将邻居特征对齐到自车特征容易受域差距噪声影响，且基于transformer的域适应模块在移动设备上推理效率低。

Method: 使用轻量级空间通道调整器(LSCR)进行空间和通道维度特征对齐，通过域分离分布对齐(DADS)模块分离域依赖信息和任务相关信息，并采用域对齐互信息(DAMI)损失增强域分离过程。

Result: CoDS有效缓解异构场景下的特征差异，在检测精度和推理效率之间取得良好平衡。

Conclusion: CoDS通过完全卷积架构和域分离策略，成功解决了异构协作感知中的特征差异问题，实现了高效准确的协作感知。

Abstract: Collaborative perception has been proven to improve individual perception in
autonomous driving through multi-agent interaction. Nevertheless, most methods
often assume identical encoders for all agents, which does not hold true when
these models are deployed in real-world applications. To realize collaborative
perception in actual heterogeneous scenarios, existing methods usually align
neighbor features to those of the ego vehicle, which is vulnerable to noise
from domain gaps and thus fails to address feature discrepancies effectively.
Moreover, they adopt transformer-based modules for domain adaptation, which
causes the model inference inefficiency on mobile devices. To tackle these
issues, we propose CoDS, a Collaborative perception method that leverages
Domain Separation to address feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios.
The CoDS employs two feature alignment modules, i.e., Lightweight
Spatial-Channel Resizer (LSCR) and Distribution Alignment via Domain Separation
(DADS). Besides, it utilizes the Domain Alignment Mutual Information (DAMI)
loss to ensure effective feature alignment. Specifically, the LSCR aligns the
neighbor feature across spatial and channel dimensions using a lightweight
convolutional layer. Subsequently, the DADS mitigates feature distribution
discrepancy with encoder-specific and encoder-agnostic domain separation
modules. The former removes domain-dependent information and the latter
captures task-related information. During training, the DAMI loss maximizes the
mutual information between aligned heterogeneous features to enhance the domain
separation process. The CoDS employs a fully convolutional architecture, which
ensures high inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
CoDS effectively mitigates feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios and
achieves a trade-off between detection accuracy and inference efficiency.

Motivation: 当前方法主要在2D像素上操作，难以分离神经元对物理场景属性的选择性。需要一种方法来表征神经元对形状、姿态、光照等3D场景属性的选择性。

Method: 使用可微分渲染管道优化可变形网格，通过径向基函数参数化网格变形，学习最大化神经元响应的偏移和尺度，同时强制几何规律性。

Result: 应用于猴子V4区域模型，能够探测神经元对姿态和光照等可解释3D因素的选择性。

Conclusion: 该方法将逆向图形学与系统神经科学连接起来，提供了一种超越传统像素方法的、基于物理的3D刺激来探测神经选择性的途径。

Abstract: Visual perception relies on inference of 3D scene properties such as shape,
pose, and lighting. To understand how visual sensory neurons enable robust
perception, it is crucial to characterize their selectivity to such physically
interpretable factors. However, current approaches mainly operate on 2D pixels,
making it difficult to isolate selectivity for physical scene properties. To
address this limitation, we introduce a differentiable rendering pipeline that
optimizes deformable meshes to obtain MEIs directly in 3D. The method
parameterizes mesh deformations with radial basis functions and learns offsets
and scales that maximize neuronal responses while enforcing geometric
regularity. Applied to models of monkey area V4, our approach enables probing
neuronal selectivity to interpretable 3D factors such as pose and lighting.
This approach bridges inverse graphics with systems neuroscience, offering a
way to probe neural selectivity with physically grounded, 3D stimuli beyond
conventional pixel-based methods.

Motivation: 探索近红外高光谱成像技术在食品质量分析中的潜力，特别是比较深度学习方法和传统PLS方法在不同分析场景下的性能差异。

Method: 通过四个研究，使用卷积神经网络（CNN）和偏最小二乘法（PLS）进行建模分析，包括2D CNN增强光谱卷积层的方法。

Result: CNN在联合空间-光谱分析中优于PLS，特别是在化学参数空间分布建模方面。PLS在分析样品化学参数平均含量时表现相当，是推荐方法。大麦发芽能力建模结果不明确。

Conclusion: 近红外高光谱成像在食品质量分析中具有潜力，CNN在复杂空间分布建模中表现优越，而PLS在平均含量分析中仍是有效方法。同时开发了两个开源Python工具包。

Abstract: This thesis investigates the application of near-infrared hyperspectral
imaging (NIR-HSI) for food quality analysis. The investigation is conducted
through four studies operating with five research hypotheses. For several
analyses, the studies compare models based on convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) and partial least squares (PLS). Generally, joint spatio-spectral
analysis with CNNs outperforms spatial analysis with CNNs and spectral analysis
with PLS when modeling parameters where chemical and physical visual
information are relevant. When modeling chemical parameters with a
2-dimensional (2D) CNN, augmenting the CNN with an initial layer dedicated to
performing spectral convolution enhances its predictive performance by learning
a spectral preprocessing similar to that applied by domain experts. Still,
PLS-based spectral modeling performs equally well for analysis of the mean
content of chemical parameters in samples and is the recommended approach.
Modeling the spatial distribution of chemical parameters with NIR-HSI is
limited by the ability to obtain spatially resolved reference values.
Therefore, a study used bulk mean references for chemical map generation of fat
content in pork bellies. A PLS-based approach gave non-smooth chemical maps and
pixel-wise predictions outside the range of 0-100\%. Conversely, a 2D CNN
augmented with a spectral convolution layer mitigated all issues arising with
PLS. The final study attempted to model barley's germinative capacity by
analyzing NIR spectra, RGB images, and NIR-HSI images. However, the results
were inconclusive due to the dataset's low degree of germination. Additionally,
this thesis has led to the development of two open-sourced Python packages. The
first facilitates fast PLS-based modeling, while the second facilitates very
fast cross-validation of PLS and other classical machine learning models with a
new algorithm.

TL;DR: VIST3A是一个文本到3D生成的通用框架，通过将文本到视频生成器与3D重建解码器结合，解决了模型拼接和对齐两个关键挑战。


<details>

Motivation: 结合现代潜在文本到视频模型的生成能力和近期前馈3D重建系统的几何能力，创建强大的3D场景生成器。

Method: 使用模型拼接技术将文本到视频生成器与3D解码器连接，并通过直接奖励微调确保生成的潜变量可解码为一致的3D场景几何。

Conclusion: VIST3A框架成功实现了文本到3D生成，为结合不同模态的生成模型提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid progress of large, pretrained models for both visual content
generation and 3D reconstruction opens up new possibilities for text-to-3D
generation. Intuitively, one could obtain a formidable 3D scene generator if
one were able to combine the power of a modern latent text-to-video model as
"generator" with the geometric abilities of a recent (feedforward) 3D
reconstruction system as "decoder". We introduce VIST3A, a general framework
that does just that, addressing two main challenges. First, the two components
must be joined in a way that preserves the rich knowledge encoded in their
weights. We revisit model stitching, i.e., we identify the layer in the 3D
decoder that best matches the latent representation produced by the
text-to-video generator and stitch the two parts together. That operation
requires only a small dataset and no labels. Second, the text-to-video
generator must be aligned with the stitched 3D decoder, to ensure that the
generated latents are decodable into consistent, perceptually convincing 3D
scene geometry. To that end, we adapt direct reward finetuning, a popular
technique for human preference alignment. We evaluate the proposed VIST3A
approach with different video generators and 3D reconstruction models. All
tested pairings markedly improve over prior text-to-3D models that output
Gaussian splats. Moreover, by choosing a suitable 3D base model, VIST3A also
enables high-quality text-to-pointmap generation.

Conclusion: 提出的训练免费不确定性度量方法能够跨数据集和VPR方法泛化，无需验证数据选择最优度量，适用于实时机器人应用，提高了精确召回性能。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) enables robots and autonomous vehicles to
identify previously visited locations by matching current observations against
a database of known places. However, VPR systems face significant challenges
when deployed across varying visual environments, lighting conditions, seasonal
changes, and viewpoints changes. Failure-critical VPR applications, such as
loop closure detection in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
pipelines, require robust estimation of place matching uncertainty. We propose
three training-free uncertainty metrics that estimate prediction confidence by
analyzing inherent statistical patterns in similarity scores from any existing
VPR method. Similarity Distribution (SD) quantifies match distinctiveness by
measuring score separation between candidates; Ratio Spread (RS) evaluates
competitive ambiguity among top-scoring locations; and Statistical Uncertainty
(SU) is a combination of SD and RS that provides a unified metric that
generalizes across datasets and VPR methods without requiring validation data
to select the optimal metric. All three metrics operate without additional
model training, architectural modifications, or computationally expensive
geometric verification. Comprehensive evaluation across nine state-of-the-art
VPR methods and six benchmark datasets confirms that our metrics excel at
discriminating between correct and incorrect VPR matches, and consistently
outperform existing approaches while maintaining negligible computational
overhead, making it deployable for real-time robotic applications across varied
environmental conditions with improved precision-recall performance.

Conclusion: 模型具有出色的适应性和泛化能力，可用于开发实际应用中的端到端情感识别系统。

Abstract: In many domains, including online education, healthcare, security, and
human-computer interaction, facial emotion recognition (FER) is essential.
Real-world FER is still difficult despite its significance because of some
factors such as variable head positions, occlusions, illumination shifts, and
demographic diversity. Engagement detection, which is essential for
applications like virtual learning and customer services, is frequently
challenging due to FER limitations by many current models. In this article, we
propose ExpressNet-MoE, a novel hybrid deep learning model that blends both
Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) and Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, to
overcome the difficulties. Our model dynamically chooses the most pertinent
expert networks, thus it aids in the generalization and providing flexibility
to model across a wide variety of datasets. Our model improves on the accuracy
of emotion recognition by utilizing multi-scale feature extraction to collect
both global and local facial features. ExpressNet-MoE includes numerous
CNN-based feature extractors, a MoE module for adaptive feature selection, and
finally a residual network backbone for deep feature learning. To demonstrate
efficacy of our proposed model we evaluated on several datasets, and compared
with current state-of-the-art methods. Our model achieves accuracies of 74.77%
on AffectNet (v7), 72.55% on AffectNet (v8), 84.29% on RAF-DB, and 64.66% on
FER-2013. The results show how adaptive our model is and how it may be used to
develop end-to-end emotion recognition systems in practical settings.

Conclusion: UniME-V2通过利用MLLM的先进理解能力，有效解决了现有方法在语义差异捕捉和负样本多样性方面的局限性，显著提升了多模态嵌入模型的判别性能。

Abstract: Universal multimodal embedding models are foundational to various tasks.
Existing approaches typically employ in-batch negative mining by measuring the
similarity of query-candidate pairs. However, these methods often struggle to
capture subtle semantic differences among candidates and lack diversity in
negative samples. Moreover, the embeddings exhibit limited discriminative
ability in distinguishing false and hard negatives. In this paper, we leverage
the advanced understanding capabilities of MLLMs to enhance representation
learning and present a novel Universal Multimodal Embedding (UniME-V2) model.
Our approach first constructs a potential hard negative set through global
retrieval. We then introduce the MLLM-as-a-Judge mechanism, which utilizes
MLLMs to assess the semantic alignment of query-candidate pairs and generate
soft semantic matching scores. These scores serve as a foundation for hard
negative mining, mitigating the impact of false negatives and enabling the
identification of diverse, high-quality hard negatives. Furthermore, the
semantic matching scores are used as soft labels to mitigate the rigid
one-to-one mapping constraint. By aligning the similarity matrix with the soft
semantic matching score matrix, the model learns semantic distinctions among
candidates, significantly enhancing its discriminative capacity. To further
improve performance, we propose UniME-V2-Reranker, a reranking model trained on
our mined hard negatives through a joint pairwise and listwise optimization
approach. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the MMEB benchmark and
multiple retrieval tasks, demonstrating that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on average across all tasks.

Conclusion: 面部动作单元是解决复杂情感识别增量学习问题的有效特征，能够实现类似人类的学习过程，从基础情感逐步学习复杂情感。

Abstract: Incremental learning is a complex process due to potential catastrophic
forgetting of old tasks when learning new ones. This is mainly due to transient
features that do not fit from task to task. In this paper, we focus on complex
emotion recognition. First, we learn basic emotions and then, incrementally,
like humans, complex emotions. We show that Action Units, describing facial
muscle movements, are non-transient, highly semantical features that outperform
those extracted by both shallow and deep convolutional neural networks. Thanks
to this ability, our approach achieves interesting results when learning
incrementally complex, compound emotions with an accuracy of 0.75 on the CFEE
dataset and can be favorably compared to state-of-the-art results. Moreover, it
results in a lightweight model with a small memory footprint.

Abstract: We present a neural parametric 3D breast shape model and, based on this
model, introduce a low-cost and accessible 3D surface reconstruction pipeline
capable of recovering accurate breast geometry from a monocular RGB video. In
contrast to widely used, commercially available yet prohibitively expensive 3D
breast scanning solutions and existing low-cost alternatives, our method
requires neither specialized hardware nor proprietary software and can be used
with any device that is able to record RGB videos. The key building blocks of
our pipeline are a state-of-the-art, off-the-shelf Structure-from-motion
pipeline, paired with a parametric breast model for robust and metrically
correct surface reconstruction. Our model, similarly to the recently proposed
implicit Regensburg Breast Shape Model (iRBSM), leverages implicit neural
representations to model breast shapes. However, unlike the iRBSM, which
employs a single global neural signed distance function (SDF), our approach --
inspired by recent state-of-the-art face models -- decomposes the implicit
breast domain into multiple smaller regions, each represented by a local neural
SDF anchored at anatomical landmark positions. When incorporated into our
surface reconstruction pipeline, the proposed model, dubbed liRBSM (short for
localized iRBSM), significantly outperforms the iRBSM in terms of
reconstruction quality, yielding more detailed surface reconstruction than its
global counterpart. Overall, we find that the introduced pipeline is able to
recover high-quality 3D breast geometry within an error margin of less than 2
mm. Our method is fast (requires less than six minutes), fully transparent and
open-source, and -- together with the model -- publicly available at

Motivation: 特征检测是SLAM系统中的耗时模块，而现代SoC平台集成了GPU和FPGA两种硬件加速器，需要系统比较它们在视觉SLAM中的性能差异。

Method: 在Nvidia Jetson Orin和AMD Versal SoC平台上，对比评估GPU和FPGA加速的FAST、Harris、SuperPoint特征检测器及其在视觉SLAM流水线中的表现。

Result: 传统检测器FAST和Harris在GPU上表现更好；学习型检测器SuperPoint在FPGA上运行时间提升3.1倍，能效提升1.4倍；GPU加速的V-SLAM精度更高。

Conclusion: 硬件加速特征检测可以减少全局捆绑调整调用频率而不损失精度；选择加速方案需根据特征检测器类型：传统检测器选GPU，学习型检测器选FPGA。

Abstract: Feature detection is a common yet time-consuming module in Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) implementations, which are increasingly
deployed on power-constrained platforms, such as drones. Graphics Processing
Units (GPUs) have been a popular accelerator for computer vision in general,
and feature detection and SLAM in particular.
  On the other hand, System-on-Chips (SoCs) with integrated Field Programmable
Gate Array (FPGA) are also widely available. This paper presents the first
study of hardware-accelerated feature detectors considering a Visual SLAM
(V-SLAM) pipeline. We offer new insights by comparing the best GPU-accelerated
FAST, Harris, and SuperPoint implementations against the FPGA-accelerated
counterparts on modern SoCs (Nvidia Jetson Orin and AMD Versal).
  The evaluation shows that when using a non-learning-based feature detector
such as FAST and Harris, their GPU implementations, and the GPU-accelerated
V-SLAM can achieve better run-time performance and energy efficiency than the
FAST and Harris FPGA implementations as well as the FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM.
However, when considering a learning-based detector such as SuperPoint, its
FPGA implementation can achieve better run-time performance and energy
efficiency (up to 3.1$\times$ and 1.4$\times$ improvements, respectively) than
the GPU implementation. The FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM can also achieve comparable
run-time performance compared to the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM, with better FPS in
2 out of 5 dataset sequences. When considering the accuracy, the results show
that the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM is more accurate than the FPGA-accelerated
V-SLAM in general. Last but not least, the use of hardware acceleration for
feature detection could further improve the performance of the V-SLAM pipeline
by having the global bundle adjustment module invoked less frequently without
sacrificing accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有面部表情识别评估通常假设同质数据和高质量图像，但实际应用中需要面对文化差异和视觉条件退化。本研究旨在探索跨文化组成和感知条件恶化如何共同影响FER的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用基于代理的流式基准测试，每个代理在冻结的CLIP特征空间中操作，配备轻量级残差适配器。代理在5x5网格上移动交互，环境提供按sigma调度的Gaussian模糊输入。研究了单文化群体、平衡/不平衡混合群体以及不同空间接触结构。

Result: 文化群体间存在不对称退化曲线：JAFFE（亚洲）群体在低模糊时性能更高但在中间阶段下降更陡峭，KDEF（西方）群体退化更均匀。混合群体呈现中间模式，平衡混合缓解早期退化但不平衡设置在高模糊下放大了多数群体的弱点。

Conclusion: 研究量化了文化组成和交互结构如何影响FER在感知条件恶化时的鲁棒性，揭示了跨文化FER系统设计需要考虑群体组成和退化模式的不对称性。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) must remain robust under both cultural
variation and perceptually degraded visual conditions, yet most existing
evaluations assume homogeneous data and high-quality imagery. We introduce an
agent-based, streaming benchmark that reveals how cross-cultural composition
and progressive blurring interact to shape face recognition robustness. Each
agent operates in a frozen CLIP feature space with a lightweight residual
adapter trained online at sigma=0 and fixed during testing. Agents move and
interact on a 5x5 lattice, while the environment provides inputs with
sigma-scheduled Gaussian blur. We examine monocultural populations
(Western-only, Asian-only) and mixed environments with balanced (5/5) and
imbalanced (8/2, 2/8) compositions, as well as different spatial contact
structures. Results show clear asymmetric degradation curves between cultural
groups: JAFFE (Asian) populations maintain higher performance at low blur but
exhibit sharper drops at intermediate stages, whereas KDEF (Western)
populations degrade more uniformly. Mixed populations exhibit intermediate
patterns, with balanced mixtures mitigating early degradation, but imbalanced
settings amplify majority-group weaknesses under high blur. These findings
quantify how cultural composition and interaction structure influence the
robustness of FER as perceptual conditions deteriorate.

and a depth-distribution distillation that recasts depth regression as soft
classification over discretized bins. Together, these components reduce the MAE

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-based object detection with visible (RGB) and
infrared (IR) images facilitates robust around-the-clock detection, driven by
advancements in deep learning techniques and the availability of high-quality
dataset. However, the existing dataset struggles to fully capture real-world
complexity for limited imaging conditions. To this end, we introduce a
high-diversity dataset ATR-UMOD covering varying scenarios, spanning altitudes
from 80m to 300m, angles from 0{\deg} to 75{\deg}, and all-day, all-year time
variations in rich weather and illumination conditions. Moreover, each RGB-IR
image pair is annotated with 6 condition attributes, offering valuable
high-level contextual information. To meet the challenge raised by such diverse
conditions, we propose a novel prompt-guided condition-aware dynamic fusion
(PCDF) to adaptively reassign multimodal contributions by leveraging annotated
condition cues. By encoding imaging conditions as text prompts, PCDF
effectively models the relationship between conditions and multimodal
contributions through a task-specific soft-gating transformation. A
prompt-guided condition-decoupling module further ensures the availability in
practice without condition annotations. Experiments on ATR-UMOD dataset reveal
the effectiveness of PCDF.

*Amjid Ali,Zulfiqar Ahmad Khan,Altaf Hussain,Muhammad Munsif,Adnan Hussain,Sung Wook Baik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AVAR-Net是一个轻量级音频-视觉异常识别框架，通过融合音频和视频特征，在真实环境中实现鲁棒的异常识别。该方法在VAAR数据集上达到89.29%准确率，在XD-Violence数据集上AP提升2.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常识别方法仅依赖视觉数据，在遮挡、低光照和恶劣天气等挑战条件下不可靠，且缺乏大规模同步音频-视觉数据集阻碍了多模态异常识别的发展。

Method: AVAR-Net包含四个模块：音频特征提取器（Wav2Vec2）、视频特征提取器（MobileViT）、早期融合机制和多阶段时序卷积网络（MTCN），用于建模跨模态关系和长程时序依赖。

Result: 在VAAR数据集上达到89.29%准确率，在XD-Violence数据集上达到88.56%平均精度，比现有最优方法提升2.8% AP。

Conclusion: AVAR-Net展示了有效性、效率和泛化能力，同时VAAR数据集为多模态异常识别研究提供了有价值的基准。

Abstract: Anomaly recognition plays a vital role in surveillance, transportation,
healthcare, and public safety. However, most existing approaches rely solely on
visual data, making them unreliable under challenging conditions such as
occlusion, low illumination, and adverse weather. Moreover, the absence of
large-scale synchronized audio-visual datasets has hindered progress in
multimodal anomaly recognition. To address these limitations, this study
presents AVAR-Net, a lightweight and efficient audio-visual anomaly recognition
framework designed for real-world environments. AVAR-Net consists of four main
modules: an audio feature extractor, a video feature extractor, fusion
strategy, and a sequential pattern learning network that models cross-modal
relationships for anomaly recognition. Specifically, the Wav2Vec2 model
extracts robust temporal features from raw audio, while MobileViT captures both
local and global visual representations from video frames. An early fusion
mechanism combines these modalities, and a Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional
Network (MTCN) model that learns long-range temporal dependencies within the
fused representation, enabling robust spatiotemporal reasoning. A novel
Visual-Audio Anomaly Recognition (VAAR) dataset, is also introduced, serving as
a medium-scale benchmark containing 3,000 real-world videos with synchronized
audio across ten diverse anomaly classes. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that AVAR-Net achieves 89.29% accuracy on VAAR and 88.56% Average Precision on
the XD-Violence dataset, improving Average Precision by 2.8% over existing
state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness,
efficiency, and generalization capability of the proposed framework, as well as
the utility of VAAR as a benchmark for advancing multimodal anomaly recognition
research.

TL;DR: 这篇系统综述分析了医学图像增强领域的关键挑战、最新进展和评估指标，基于39篇同行评审研究，发现低对比度和噪声是最常见问题，MRI和多模态成像研究最多，而组织病理学等专业模态研究不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像质量对诊断至关重要，但常受噪声、伪影和低对比度等问题影响，需要有效的增强方法来提高诊断准确性和治疗效果。

Method: 采用PRISMA方法的系统文献综述，分析了39篇同行评审研究，涵盖不同成像模态和增强技术。

Result: 发现29项研究使用传统数学方法，9项专注于深度学习技术，1项探索混合方法；在图像质量评估方面，18项研究同时使用参考和非参考指标，共引入了65个IQA指标，主要为非参考指标。

Conclusion: 综述指出了当前医学图像增强领域的局限性、研究空白和未来发展方向，强调需要更多针对专业成像模态的研究和更全面的评估方法。

Abstract: Medical image enhancement is crucial for improving the quality and
interpretability of diagnostic images, ultimately supporting early detection,
accurate diagnosis, and effective treatment planning. Despite advancements in
imaging technologies such as X-ray, CT, MRI, and ultrasound, medical images
often suffer from challenges like noise, artifacts, and low contrast, which
limit their diagnostic potential. Addressing these challenges requires robust
preprocessing, denoising algorithms, and advanced enhancement methods, with
deep learning techniques playing an increasingly significant role. This
systematic literature review, following the PRISMA approach, investigates the
key challenges, recent advancements, and evaluation metrics in medical image
enhancement. By analyzing findings from 39 peer-reviewed studies, this review
provides insights into the effectiveness of various enhancement methods across
different imaging modalities and the importance of evaluation metrics in
assessing their impact. Key issues like low contrast and noise are identified
as the most frequent, with MRI and multi-modal imaging receiving the most
attention, while specialized modalities such as histopathology, endoscopy, and
bone scintigraphy remain underexplored. Out of the 39 studies, 29 utilize
conventional mathematical methods, 9 focus on deep learning techniques, and 1
explores a hybrid approach. In terms of image quality assessment, 18 studies
employ both reference-based and non-reference-based metrics, 9 rely solely on
reference-based metrics, and 12 use only non-reference-based metrics, with a
total of 65 IQA metrics introduced, predominantly non-reference-based. This
review highlights current limitations, research gaps, and potential future
directions for advancing medical image enhancement.

*Akib Mohammed Khan,Bartosz Krawczyk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文系统研究了基于DINOv2的少样本异常检测器的对抗攻击脆弱性和不确定性校准问题，提出了攻击检测和不确定性估计的基准方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于DINOv2的异常检测器在对抗攻击下的鲁棒性和异常分数的校准不确定性尚未得到充分研究，这限制了其在安全关键场景中的可信部署。

Method: 在AnomalyDINO基础上，通过添加轻量级线性头进行白盒梯度攻击，同时使用Platt缩放对异常分数进行后处理以进行不确定性估计。

Result: 研究发现微小扰动可导致特征空间中的最近邻关系翻转，造成错误分类；原始异常分数校准性差，而经过校准的后验分布能有效检测对抗攻击并降低校准误差。

Conclusion: 对抗鲁棒性和原则性不确定性量化是异常检测系统可信部署的必备能力，研究为稳健、不确定性感知的异常检测建立了评估协议和基准。

Abstract: Foundation models such as DINOv2 have shown strong performance in few-shot
anomaly detection, yet two key questions remain unexamined: (i) how susceptible
are these detectors to adversarial perturbations; and (ii) how well do their
anomaly scores reflect calibrated uncertainty? Building on AnomalyDINO, a
training-free deep nearest-neighbor detector over DINOv2 features, we present
one of the first systematic studies of adversarial attacks and uncertainty
estimation in this setting. To enable white-box gradient attacks while
preserving test-time behavior, we attach a lightweight linear head to frozen
DINOv2 features only for crafting perturbations. Using this heuristic, we
evaluate the impact of FGSM across the MVTec-AD and VisA datasets and observe
consistent drops in F1, AUROC, AP, and G-mean, indicating that imperceptible
perturbations can flip nearest-neighbor relations in feature space to induce
confident misclassification. Complementing robustness, we probe reliability and
find that raw anomaly scores are poorly calibrated, revealing a gap between
confidence and correctness that limits safety-critical use. As a simple, strong
baseline toward trustworthiness, we apply post-hoc Platt scaling to the anomaly
scores for uncertainty estimation. The resulting calibrated posteriors yield
significantly higher predictive entropy on adversarially perturbed inputs than
on clean ones, enabling a practical flagging mechanism for attack detection
while reducing calibration error (ECE). Our findings surface concrete
vulnerabilities in DINOv2-based few-shot anomaly detectors and establish an
evaluation protocol and baseline for robust, uncertainty-aware anomaly
detection. We argue that adversarial robustness and principled uncertainty
quantification are not optional add-ons but essential capabilities if anomaly
detection systems are to be trustworthy and ready for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种上下文精确的图像超分辨率框架，通过局部-全局上下文感知注意力机制和分布-感知对齐条件机制，在保持像素关系的同时生成高质量图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的超分辨率方法在处理多样化和高度退化图像时，往往会产生噪声放大或错误内容生成的问题，需要改进以保持结构一致性。

Method: 使用局部-全局上下文感知注意力机制维护像素关系，结合分布和感知对齐的条件机制在像素空间中增强感知保真度，从局部细节到全局结构逐步保留和精炼信息。

Result: 在多个超分辨率基准测试中，该方法能够生成与原始内容结构一致的高质量图像，减少伪影并确保真实的细节恢复。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架在生成高保真、感知准确的超分辨率重建方面表现出有效性，特别是在处理多样化退化图像时优于现有方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently achieved significant success in various image
manipulation tasks, including image super-resolution and perceptual quality
enhancement. Pretrained text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion, have
exhibited strong capabilities in synthesizing realistic image content, which
makes them particularly attractive for addressing super-resolution tasks. While
some existing approaches leverage these models to achieve state-of-the-art
results, they often struggle when applied to diverse and highly degraded
images, leading to noise amplification or incorrect content generation. To
address these limitations, we propose a contextually precise image
super-resolution framework that effectively maintains both local and global
pixel relationships through Local-Global Context-Aware Attention, enabling the
generation of high-quality images. Furthermore, we propose a distribution- and
perceptual-aligned conditioning mechanism in the pixel space to enhance
perceptual fidelity. This mechanism captures fine-grained pixel-level
representations while progressively preserving and refining structural
information, transitioning from local content details to the global structural
composition. During inference, our method generates high-quality images that
are structurally consistent with the original content, mitigating artifacts and
ensuring realistic detail restoration. Extensive experiments on multiple
super-resolution benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
producing high-fidelity, perceptually accurate reconstructions.

Motivation: 现有基础模型在图像编辑方面取得显著进展，但扩展到3D编辑仍存在挑战，主要由于计算成本高和闭源API限制，难以集成到现有迭代编辑流程中。

Method: 采用视频生成基础模型从单帧传播编辑到整个数据集，引入视图选择策略识别一致且适合重建的视图，采用前馈重建避免昂贵细化。

Result: 在常用3D编辑数据集上评估，相比最先进的3D编辑基线，EditCast3D展现出更优的编辑质量和更高效率。

Conclusion: EditCast3D为将基础模型集成到3D编辑管道提供了一个可扩展且通用的范例，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have driven remarkable progress in image
editing, yet their extension to 3D editing remains underexplored. A natural
approach is to replace the image editing modules in existing workflows with
foundation models. However, their heavy computational demands and the
restrictions and costs of closed-source APIs make plugging these models into
existing iterative editing strategies impractical. To address this limitation,
we propose EditCast3D, a pipeline that employs video generation foundation
models to propagate edits from a single first frame across the entire dataset
prior to reconstruction. While editing propagation enables dataset-level
editing via video models, its consistency remains suboptimal for 3D
reconstruction, where multi-view alignment is essential. To overcome this,
EditCast3D introduces a view selection strategy that explicitly identifies
consistent and reconstruction-friendly views and adopts feedforward
reconstruction without requiring costly refinement. In combination, the
pipeline both minimizes reliance on expensive image editing and mitigates
prompt ambiguities that arise when applying foundation models independently
across images. We evaluate EditCast3D on commonly used 3D editing datasets and
compare it against state-of-the-art 3D editing baselines, demonstrating
superior editing quality and high efficiency. These results establish
EditCast3D as a scalable and general paradigm for integrating foundation models
into 3D editing pipelines. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D视线估计方法在跨域泛化方面存在困难，主要由于标注数据稀缺和标注数据多样性不足。

Method: 构建多样化的无标签面部图像集，采用伪标签策略并设计奖励模型评估伪标签可靠性，结合视觉嵌入和语义线索计算置信度得分，选择高质量伪标签进行训练。

Result: 在五个数据集上实现了最先进的性能，在域内和跨域设置下均表现优异，并在四个未见数据集上展现出强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: OmniGaze不仅是一个有效的3D视线估计方法，还可作为可扩展的数据引擎，显著提升了视线估计的泛化性能。

Abstract: Current 3D gaze estimation methods struggle to generalize across diverse data
domains, primarily due to i) the scarcity of annotated datasets, and ii) the
insufficient diversity of labeled data. In this work, we present OmniGaze, a
semi-supervised framework for 3D gaze estimation, which utilizes large-scale
unlabeled data collected from diverse and unconstrained real-world environments
to mitigate domain bias and generalize gaze estimation in the wild. First, we
build a diverse collection of unlabeled facial images, varying in facial
appearances, background environments, illumination conditions, head poses, and
eye occlusions. In order to leverage unlabeled data spanning a broader
distribution, OmniGaze adopts a standard pseudo-labeling strategy and devises a
reward model to assess the reliability of pseudo labels. Beyond pseudo labels
as 3D direction vectors, the reward model also incorporates visual embeddings
extracted by an off-the-shelf visual encoder and semantic cues from gaze
perspective generated by prompting a Multimodal Large Language Model to compute
confidence scores. Then, these scores are utilized to select high-quality
pseudo labels and weight them for loss computation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that OmniGaze achieves state-of-the-art performance on five
datasets under both in-domain and cross-domain settings. Furthermore, we also
evaluate the efficacy of OmniGaze as a scalable data engine for gaze
estimation, which exhibits robust zero-shot generalization on four unseen
datasets.

TL;DR: CanvasMAR是一种新颖的视频掩码自回归模型，通过引入画布机制解决慢启动问题和误差累积问题，能够用更少的自回归步骤生成高质量视频。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的视频掩码自回归模型存在两个主要限制：慢启动问题（早期采样阶段缺乏结构化全局先验）以及空间和时间维度上自回归过程中的误差累积。

Method: 提出画布机制——对下一帧的模糊全局预测，作为掩码生成的起点；引入组合式无分类器引导，联合扩大空间（画布）和时间条件；采用基于噪声的画布增强来提高鲁棒性。

Result: 在BAIR和Kinetics-600基准测试中，CanvasMAR能够用更少的自回归步骤生成高质量视频，在Kinetics-600数据集上取得了显著性能，与基于扩散的方法相媲美。

Conclusion: CanvasMAR通过画布机制有效解决了视频掩码自回归模型的慢启动和误差累积问题，在减少自回归步骤的同时保持视频生成质量，展示了掩码自回归模型在视频生成领域的竞争力。

Abstract: Masked autoregressive models (MAR) have recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for image and video generation, combining the flexibility of masked
modeling with the potential of continuous tokenizer. However, video MAR models
suffer from two major limitations: the slow-start problem, caused by the lack
of a structured global prior at early sampling stages, and error accumulation
across the autoregression in both spatial and temporal dimensions. In this
work, we propose CanvasMAR, a novel video MAR model that mitigates these issues
by introducing a canvas mechanism--a blurred, global prediction of the next
frame, used as the starting point for masked generation. The canvas provides
global structure early in sampling, enabling faster and more coherent frame
synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce compositional classifier-free guidance
that jointly enlarges spatial (canvas) and temporal conditioning, and employ
noise-based canvas augmentation to enhance robustness. Experiments on the BAIR
and Kinetics-600 benchmarks demonstrate that CanvasMAR produces high-quality
videos with fewer autoregressive steps. Our approach achieves remarkable
performance among autoregressive models on Kinetics-600 dataset and rivals
diffusion-based methods.

Conclusion: 结合视觉、文本和结构化知识能显著提升开放域视觉实体识别性能，特别是对罕见和未见实体的识别效果。

Abstract: Open-domain visual entity recognition aims to identify and link entities
depicted in images to a vast and evolving set of real-world concepts, such as
those found in Wikidata. Unlike conventional classification tasks with fixed
label sets, it operates under open-set conditions, where most target entities
are unseen during training and exhibit long-tail distributions. This makes the
task inherently challenging due to limited supervision, high visual ambiguity,
and the need for semantic disambiguation. In this work, we propose a
Knowledge-guided Contrastive Learning (KnowCoL) framework that combines both
images and text descriptions into a shared semantic space grounded by
structured information from Wikidata. By abstracting visual and textual inputs
to a conceptual level, the model leverages entity descriptions, type
hierarchies, and relational context to support zero-shot entity recognition. We
evaluate our approach on the OVEN benchmark, a large-scale open-domain visual
recognition dataset with Wikidata IDs as the label space. Our experiments show
that using visual, textual, and structured knowledge greatly improves accuracy,
especially for rare and unseen entities. Our smallest model improves the
accuracy on unseen entities by 10.5% compared to the state-of-the-art, despite
being 35 times smaller.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多视图导向方法生成多视图图像再进行3D重建，存在效率问题。3D导向方法虽然保证3D一致性但视觉质量较差。需要结合两种方法的优势。

Method: 采用双模式预训练和跨模式后训练：首先预训练支持多视图导向和3D导向的双模式多视图扩散模型；然后通过跨模式蒸馏将3D导向模式的分布匹配到高质量的多视图导向模式。

Result: 实验证明该方法在保持3D一致性的同时显著提升视觉质量，并减少推理所需的去噪步骤，速度提升10-100倍。

Conclusion: FlashWorld成功整合了多视图导向和3D导向方法的优势，实现了高效高质量的3D场景生成，并增强了对外分布输入的泛化能力。

Abstract: We propose FlashWorld, a generative model that produces 3D scenes from a
single image or text prompt in seconds, 10~100$\times$ faster than previous
works while possessing superior rendering quality. Our approach shifts from the
conventional multi-view-oriented (MV-oriented) paradigm, which generates
multi-view images for subsequent 3D reconstruction, to a 3D-oriented approach
where the model directly produces 3D Gaussian representations during multi-view
generation. While ensuring 3D consistency, 3D-oriented method typically suffers
poor visual quality. FlashWorld includes a dual-mode pre-training phase
followed by a cross-mode post-training phase, effectively integrating the
strengths of both paradigms. Specifically, leveraging the prior from a video
diffusion model, we first pre-train a dual-mode multi-view diffusion model,
which jointly supports MV-oriented and 3D-oriented generation modes. To bridge
the quality gap in 3D-oriented generation, we further propose a cross-mode
post-training distillation by matching distribution from consistent 3D-oriented
mode to high-quality MV-oriented mode. This not only enhances visual quality
while maintaining 3D consistency, but also reduces the required denoising steps
for inference. Also, we propose a strategy to leverage massive single-view
images and text prompts during this process to enhance the model's
generalization to out-of-distribution inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority and efficiency of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学影像中生成健康的反事实图像对于异常检测和健康扫描分析工具的应用具有重要意义。现有方法难以在去除异常和保留个体特征之间取得平衡。

Method: 使用去噪扩散桥模型（DDBM），不仅以健康图像为初始条件，还以合成的病理图像为最终条件，将病理图像作为结构信息先验来指导生成过程。

Result: DDBM在分割和异常检测任务中优于先前提出的扩散模型和全监督方法。

Conclusion: DDBM能够生成更准确匹配患者解剖结构同时选择性去除病理的健康反事实图像，在医学影像应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Generating healthy counterfactuals from pathological images holds significant
promise in medical imaging, e.g., in anomaly detection or for application of
analysis tools that are designed for healthy scans. These counterfactuals
should represent what a patient's scan would plausibly look like in the absence
of pathology, preserving individual anatomical characteristics while modifying
only the pathological regions. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs)
have become popular methods for generating healthy counterfactuals of pathology
data. Typically, this involves training on solely healthy data with the
assumption that a partial denoising process will be unable to model disease
regions and will instead reconstruct a closely matched healthy counterpart.
More recent methods have incorporated synthetic pathological images to better
guide the diffusion process. However, it remains challenging to guide the
generative process in a way that effectively balances the removal of anomalies
with the retention of subject-specific features. To solve this problem, we
propose a novel application of denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) -
which, unlike DDPMs, condition the diffusion process not only on the initial
point (i.e., the healthy image), but also on the final point (i.e., a
corresponding synthetically generated pathological image). Treating the
pathological image as a structurally informative prior enables us to generate
counterfactuals that closely match the patient's anatomy while selectively
removing pathology. The results show that our DDBM outperforms previously
proposed diffusion models and fully supervised approaches at segmentation and
anomaly detection tasks.

Result: 在多个多模态安全和效用基准测试中，RAS显著降低了攻击成功率，保持了通用任务性能，并提高了推理速度，优于先前的推理时防御方法。

Conclusion: RAS方法有效解决了多模态查询的安全对齐问题，在保持模型效用的同时提高了安全性，且具有更好的推理效率。

Abstract: One of the key challenges of modern AI models is ensuring that they provide
helpful responses to benign queries while refusing malicious ones. But often,
the models are vulnerable to multimodal queries with harmful intent embedded in
images. One approach for safety alignment is training with extensive safety
datasets at the significant costs in both dataset curation and training.
Inference-time alignment mitigates these costs, but introduces two drawbacks:
excessive refusals from misclassified benign queries and slower inference speed
due to iterative output adjustments. To overcome these limitations, we propose
to reformulate queries to strengthen cross-modal attention to safety-critical
image regions, enabling accurate risk assessment at the query level. Using the
assessed risk, it adaptively steers activations to generate responses that are
safe and helpful without overhead from iterative output adjustments. We call
this Risk-adaptive Activation Steering (RAS). Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks on multimodal safety and utility demonstrate that the RAS
significantly reduces attack success rates, preserves general task performance,
and improves inference speed over prior inference-time defenses.

### [159] [MVCustom: Multi-View Customized Diffusion via Geometric Latent Rendering and Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13702)
*Minjung Shin,Hyunin Cho,Sooyeon Go,Jin-Hwa Kim,Youngjung Uh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MVCustom框架，解决多视角生成与个性化定制统一的问题，通过特征场表示和深度感知特征渲染实现几何一致性和视角控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在局限：多视角生成模型不支持几何一致的个性化定制，而个性化模型缺乏明确的视角控制，难以统一这两个需求。

Method: 使用特征场表示学习主体身份和几何，结合文本到视频扩散骨干网络增强时空注意力；推理阶段引入深度感知特征渲染和一致性感知潜在补全技术。

Result: MVCustom是唯一能同时实现忠实多视角生成和个性化定制的框架，在实验中表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了多视角定制任务，为可控生成模型提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-view generation with camera pose control and prompt-based customization
are both essential elements for achieving controllable generative models.
However, existing multi-view generation models do not support customization
with geometric consistency, whereas customization models lack explicit
viewpoint control, making them challenging to unify. Motivated by these gaps,
we introduce a novel task, multi-view customization, which aims to jointly
achieve multi-view camera pose control and customization. Due to the scarcity
of training data in customization, existing multi-view generation models, which
inherently rely on large-scale datasets, struggle to generalize to diverse
prompts. To address this, we propose MVCustom, a novel diffusion-based
framework explicitly designed to achieve both multi-view consistency and
customization fidelity. In the training stage, MVCustom learns the subject's
identity and geometry using a feature-field representation, incorporating the
text-to-video diffusion backbone enhanced with dense spatio-temporal attention,
which leverages temporal coherence for multi-view consistency. In the inference
stage, we introduce two novel techniques: depth-aware feature rendering
explicitly enforces geometric consistency, and consistent-aware latent
completion ensures accurate perspective alignment of the customized subject and
surrounding backgrounds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVCustom is the
only framework that simultaneously achieves faithful multi-view generation and
customization.

*Fabio Musio,Norman Juchler,Kaiyuan Yang,Suprosanna Shit,Chinmay Prabhakar,Bjoern Menze,Sven Hirsch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种基于学习的方法，从脑部血管图像中提取Willis环的中心线表示，结合U-Net骨架化和A*图连接算法，实现了高精度的解剖结构重建和形态特征提取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Willis环是脑部关键动脉网络，传统骨架化方法难以可靠提取其复杂几何结构的中心线，且公开的中心线数据集稀缺，需要开发更准确的自动化分析方法。

Method: 使用细化骨架化算法从TopCoW数据集提取中心线图，开发基线算法结合U-Net骨架化和A*图连接，评估解剖准确性和特征鲁棒性。

Result: 算法在测试集上实现高精度图拓扑重建（F1=1），平均欧几里得节点距离小于1体素，半径、长度等特征相对误差中位数低于5%，皮尔逊相关系数高于0.95。

Conclusion: 基于学习的骨架化结合图连接能有效提取解剖合理的中心线，评估解剖准确性和特征鲁棒性比简单体素测量更重要，数据集和算法已公开以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: The Circle of Willis (CoW) is a critical network of arteries in the brain,
often implicated in cerebrovascular pathologies. Voxel-level segmentation is an
important first step toward an automated CoW assessment, but a full
quantitative analysis requires centerline representations. However,
conventional skeletonization techniques often struggle to extract reliable
centerlines due to the CoW's complex geometry, and publicly available
centerline datasets remain scarce. To address these challenges, we used a
thinning-based skeletonization algorithm to extract and curate centerline
graphs and morphometric features from the TopCoW dataset, which includes 200
stroke patients, each imaged with MRA and CTA. The curated graphs were used to
develop a baseline algorithm for centerline and feature extraction, combining
U-Net-based skeletonization with A* graph connection. Performance was evaluated
on a held-out test set, focusing on anatomical accuracy and feature robustness.
Further, we used the extracted features to predict the frequency of fetal PCA
variants, confirm theoretical bifurcation optimality relations, and detect
subtle modality differences. The baseline algorithm consistently reconstructed
graph topology with high accuracy (F1 = 1), and the average Euclidean node
distance between reference and predicted graphs was below one voxel. Features
such as segment radius, length, and bifurcation ratios showed strong
robustness, with median relative errors below 5% and Pearson correlations above
0.95. Our results demonstrate the utility of learning-based skeletonization
combined with graph connection for anatomically plausible centerline
extraction. We emphasize the importance of going beyond simple voxel-based
measures by evaluating anatomical accuracy and feature robustness. The dataset
and baseline algorithm have been released to support further method development
and clinical research.

*Xinchen Zhang,Xiaoying Zhang,Youbin Wu,Yanbin Cao,Renrui Zhang,Ruihang Chu,Ling Yang,Yujiu Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Generative Universal Verifier概念，用于多模态推理中的视觉结果验证和优化，通过构建ViVerBench基准、训练OmniVerifier-7B验证器以及提出OmniVerifier-TTS测试时扩展方法，显著提升了多模态模型的视觉验证能力和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在视觉结果验证方面存在显著不足，无法达到人类水平的可靠视觉验证能力，需要开发能够进行反思和优化的通用验证器。

Method: 1) 构建ViVerBench基准评估视觉验证能力；2) 设计自动化流水线构建大规模视觉验证数据，训练OmniVerifier-7B通用验证器；3) 提出OmniVerifier-TTS序列测试时扩展范式，通过迭代优化提升生成能力。

Result: OmniVerifier-7B在ViVerBench上提升8.3分；OmniVerifier-TTS在T2I-ReasonBench和GenEval++上分别提升3.7和4.3分，优于现有的并行测试时扩展方法。

Conclusion: 通过赋予多模态推理可靠的视觉验证能力，OmniVerifier推进了生成过程中的可靠反思和可扩展的测试时优化，朝着更可信和可控的下一代推理系统迈进一步。

Abstract: We introduce Generative Universal Verifier, a novel concept and plugin
designed for next-generation multimodal reasoning in vision-language models and
unified multimodal models, providing the fundamental capability of reflection
and refinement on visual outcomes during the reasoning and generation process.
This work makes three main contributions: (1) We build ViVerBench, a
comprehensive benchmark spanning 16 categories of critical tasks for evaluating
visual outcomes in multimodal reasoning. Results show that existing VLMs
consistently underperform across these tasks, underscoring a substantial gap
from human-level capability in reliable visual verification. (2) We design two
automated pipelines to construct large-scale visual verification data and train
OmniVerifier-7B, the first omni-capable generative verifier trained for
universal visual verification and achieves notable gains on ViVerBench(+8.3).
Through training, we identify three atomic capabilities in visual verification
and demonstrate how they generalize and interact synergistically. (3) We
propose OmniVerifier-TTS, a sequential test-time scaling paradigm that
leverages the universal verifier to bridge image generation and editing within
unified models, enhancing the upper bound of generative ability through
iterative fine-grained optimization. Beyond generation, we extend universal
verifier to broader world-modeling interleaved reasoning scenarios.
Empirically, OmniVerifier-TTS achieves improvements on T2I-ReasonBench(+3.7),
and GenEval++(+4.3), outperforming existing parallel test-time scaling methods,
such as Best-of-N. By endowing multimodal reasoning with reliable visual
verification, OmniVerifier advances both reliable reflection during generation
and scalable test-time refinement, marking a step toward more trustworthy and
controllable next-generation reasoning systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了LiFMCR数据集，用于多微透镜阵列光场相机配准，包含两个高分辨率Raytrix R32相机的同步图像序列和Vicon运动捕捉系统记录的高精度6自由度位姿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有光场数据集仅限于单相机设置且缺乏外部真实值，无法满足多相机光场配准方法的严格评估需求。

Method: 提供了两种互补的配准方法：基于RANSAC的跨视图点云3D变换估计，以及从单光场图像估计外部6自由度位姿的光场PnP算法。

Result: 实验显示与真实值有很强的对齐性，支持可靠的多视角光场处理。

Conclusion: LiFMCR数据集及其配准方法为多相机光场配准提供了可靠的评估基准，推动了多视角光场处理的发展。

Abstract: We present LiFMCR, a novel dataset for the registration of multiple micro
lens array (MLA)-based light field cameras. While existing light field datasets
are limited to single-camera setups and typically lack external ground truth,
LiFMCR provides synchronized image sequences from two high-resolution Raytrix
R32 plenoptic cameras, together with high-precision 6-degrees of freedom (DoF)
poses recorded by a Vicon motion capture system. This unique combination
enables rigorous evaluation of multi-camera light field registration methods.
  As a baseline, we provide two complementary registration approaches: a robust
3D transformation estimation via a RANSAC-based method using cross-view point
clouds, and a plenoptic PnP algorithm estimating extrinsic 6-DoF poses from
single light field images. Both explicitly integrate the plenoptic camera
model, enabling accurate and scalable multi-camera registration. Experiments
show strong alignment with the ground truth, supporting reliable multi-view
light field processing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种循环自监督扩散框架（CSS-Diff），用于从真实低场MRI数据合成高场MRI图像，通过循环一致性约束和两个新网络来保持解剖结构保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低场MRI更便宜、更易获取且更安全，但存在分辨率低和信噪比差的问题。合成高场MRI可以减少对昂贵采集的依赖，但现有方法存在临床保真度差距，需要保持解剖保真度、增强细粒度结构细节并弥合图像对比度差异。

Method: 提出CSS-Diff框架，核心思想是在循环一致性约束下重新制定基于扩散的合成方法。包含两个新过程：切片间差距感知网络通过对比学习对齐切片间不一致性；局部结构校正网络通过掩码和扰动补丁的自重建来增强局部特征恢复。

Result: 在跨场合成任务中达到最先进性能（PSNR 31.80±2.70 dB，SSIM 0.943±0.102，LPIPS 0.0864±0.0689）。相比原始低场MRI，能更好地保留细粒度解剖结构（如左脑白质误差从12.1%降至2.1%，皮层从4.2%降至3.7%）。

Conclusion: CSS-Diff能够合成在定量上可靠且在解剖学上一致的图像，解决了高场MRI合成中的临床保真度问题。

Abstract: Synthesizing high-quality images from low-field MRI holds significant
potential. Low-field MRI is cheaper, more accessible, and safer, but suffers
from low resolution and poor signal-to-noise ratio. This synthesis process can
reduce reliance on costly acquisitions and expand data availability. However,
synthesizing high-field MRI still suffers from a clinical fidelity gap. There
is a need to preserve anatomical fidelity, enhance fine-grained structural
details, and bridge domain gaps in image contrast. To address these issues, we
propose a \emph{cyclic self-supervised diffusion (CSS-Diff)} framework for
high-field MRI synthesis from real low-field MRI data. Our core idea is to
reformulate diffusion-based synthesis under a cycle-consistent constraint. It
enforces anatomical preservation throughout the generative process rather than
just relying on paired pixel-level supervision. The CSS-Diff framework further
incorporates two novel processes. The slice-wise gap perception network aligns
inter-slice inconsistencies via contrastive learning. The local structure
correction network enhances local feature restoration through
self-reconstruction of masked and perturbed patches. Extensive experiments on
cross-field synthesis tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method,
achieving state-of-the-art performance (e.g., 31.80 $\pm$ 2.70 dB in PSNR,
0.943 $\pm$ 0.102 in SSIM, and 0.0864 $\pm$ 0.0689 in LPIPS). Beyond pixel-wise
fidelity, our method also preserves fine-grained anatomical structures compared
with the original low-field MRI (e.g., left cerebral white matter error drops
from 12.1$\%$ to 2.1$\%$, cortex from 4.2$\%$ to 3.7$\%$). To conclude, our
CSS-Diff can synthesize images that are both quantitatively reliable and
anatomically consistent.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了LogViG模型，使用对数可扩展图构建(LSGC)方法来改进视觉图神经网络，通过限制长距离连接数量来提升性能，在图像分类和语义分割任务上超越了现有ViG、CNN和ViT架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图构建方法如KNN在较大图像上计算成本高，而SVGA的固定步长尺度会导致过度压缩和缺失长距离连接，无法获得长距离链接带来的信息增益。

Method: 提出对数可扩展图构建(LSGC)方法，并构建LogViG混合CNN-GNN模型，结合高分辨率分支和多尺度特征融合技术。

Result: 最小模型Ti-LogViG在ImageNet-1K上达到79.9%的平均top-1准确率，比Vision GNN高1.7%，同时参数减少24.3%，GMACs减少35.3%。

Conclusion: 通过LSGC方法在ViG中利用长距离连接可以超越当前最先进的ViG性能。

Abstract: Vision graph neural networks (ViG) have demonstrated promise in vision tasks
as a competitive alternative to conventional convolutional neural nets (CNN)
and transformers (ViTs); however, common graph construction methods, such as
k-nearest neighbor (KNN), can be expensive on larger images. While methods such
as Sparse Vision Graph Attention (SVGA) have shown promise, SVGA's fixed step
scale can lead to over-squashing and missing multiple connections to gain the
same information that could be gained from a long-range link. Through this
observation, we propose a new graph construction method, Logarithmic Scalable
Graph Construction (LSGC) to enhance performance by limiting the number of
long-range links. To this end, we propose LogViG, a novel hybrid CNN-GNN model
that utilizes LSGC. Furthermore, inspired by the successes of multi-scale and
high-resolution architectures, we introduce and apply a high-resolution branch
and fuse features between our high-resolution and low-resolution branches for a
multi-scale high-resolution Vision GNN network. Extensive experiments show that
LogViG beats existing ViG, CNN, and ViT architectures in terms of accuracy,
GMACs, and parameters on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks.
Our smallest model, Ti-LogViG, achieves an average top-1 accuracy on
ImageNet-1K of 79.9% with a standard deviation of 0.2%, 1.7% higher average
accuracy than Vision GNN with a 24.3% reduction in parameters and 35.3%
reduction in GMACs. Our work shows that leveraging long-range links in graph
construction for ViGs through our proposed LSGC can exceed the performance of
current state-of-the-art ViGs. Code is available at

TL;DR: UniCalli是一个统一的扩散框架，用于解决中文书法计算复制的挑战，通过联合训练识别和生成任务，在保持字符结构的同时提升页面级美学质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么生成高质量单字但忽略页面级美学（如连笔和间距），要么尝试页面合成但牺牲书法正确性。需要一种统一方法来解决这些局限性。

Method: 采用统一的扩散框架，联合训练识别和生成任务，使用非对称加噪和栅格化框图提供空间先验，在合成、标注和未标注数据的混合数据集上训练。

Result: 模型在生成质量上达到最先进水平，具有优越的连笔连续性和布局保真度，同时识别能力更强，并能成功扩展到其他古代文字。

Conclusion: UniCalli通过识别和生成任务的协同作用，在有限数据情况下实现了概念级抽象，显著提升了书法计算复制的质量。

Abstract: Computational replication of Chinese calligraphy remains challenging.
Existing methods falter, either creating high-quality isolated characters while
ignoring page-level aesthetics like ligatures and spacing, or attempting page
synthesis at the expense of calligraphic correctness. We introduce
\textbf{UniCalli}, a unified diffusion framework for column-level recognition
and generation. Training both tasks jointly is deliberate: recognition
constrains the generator to preserve character structure, while generation
provides style and layout priors. This synergy fosters concept-level
abstractions that improve both tasks, especially in limited-data regimes. We
curated a dataset of over 8,000 digitized pieces, with ~4,000 densely
annotated. UniCalli employs asymmetric noising and a rasterized box map for
spatial priors, trained on a mix of synthetic, labeled, and unlabeled data. The
model achieves state-of-the-art generative quality with superior ligature
continuity and layout fidelity, alongside stronger recognition. The framework
successfully extends to other ancient scripts, including Oracle bone
inscriptions and Egyptian hieroglyphs. Code and data can be viewed in

Motivation: 开发一个轻量级的全模态模型，提供全面的多模态理解和语音生成能力，推动下一代智能交互系统的发展。

Method: 采用多阶段训练策略：全模态预训练、语音对话和音视频交互的后训练，并精心构建多轮训练数据集增强长期对话能力。

Result: 在图像、音频、视频理解和语音生成任务上达到同类模型的最佳性能，4B版本性能接近Qwen2.5-Omni-7B，且能保留8B版本97%的性能。

Conclusion: InteractiveOmni为下一代智能交互系统提供了一个可访问的开源基础，在长期记忆和多轮音视频交互方面表现突出。

Abstract: We introduce InteractiveOmni, a unified and open-source omni-modal large
language model for audio-visual multi-turn interaction, ranging from 4B to 8B
parameters, designed to lead the field of lightweight models by offering
comprehensive omni-modal understanding and speech generation capabilities. To
achieve this, we integrate the vision encoder, audio encoder, large language
model, and speech decoder into a unified model for understanding and generation
tasks. We design a multi-stage training strategy to ensure robust cross-modal
capabilities, including pre-training for omni-modal understanding, followed by
post-training with speech conversation and audio-visual interaction. To enable
human-like long-term conversational ability, we meticulously curate a
multi-turn training dataset that enhances the model's ability to handle complex
and multi-turn interactions. To effectively evaluate the multi-turn memory and
speech interaction capabilities, we construct the multi-modal multi-turn memory
benchmark and the multi-turn speech interaction benchmark. Experiments
demonstrate that InteractiveOmni significantly outperforms leading open-source
models and provides a more intelligent multi-turn audio-visual experience,
particularly in its long-term memory capabilities. Notably, InteractiveOmni-4B
is comparable to the much larger model like Qwen2.5-Omni-7B on general
benchmarks, and it can retain 97% of the performance of the InteractiveOmni-8B
while utilizing only 50% of the model size. Achieving state-of-the-art results
against similarly sized models across image, audio, video understanding, and
speech generation tasks, InteractiveOmni is an accessible, open-source
foundation for next-generation intelligent interactive systems.

TL;DR: RECODE是一个代理框架，通过将视觉内容反渲染为可执行代码来实现可验证的视觉推理，在多个基准测试中显著优于不利用代码或仅将代码用于辅助绘图的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理结构化视觉内容（如图表和图表）时缺乏验证机制，导致精确推理能力不足。

Method: 提出RECODE框架：首先生成多个候选程序来重现输入图像，然后使用批评器选择最忠实的重建，并迭代优化代码。

Result: 在CharXiv、ChartQA和Geometry3K等视觉推理基准测试中，RECODE显著优于不利用代码或仅将代码用于辅助绘图的方法。

Conclusion: 将视觉感知基于可执行代码为实现更准确和可验证的多模态推理提供了新途径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with precise reasoning for
structured visuals like charts and diagrams, as pixel-based perception lacks a
mechanism for verification. To address this, we propose to leverage derendering
-- the process of reverse-engineering visuals into executable code -- as a new
modality for verifiable visual reasoning. Specifically, we propose RECODE, an
agentic framework that first generates multiple candidate programs to reproduce
the input image. It then uses a critic to select the most faithful
reconstruction and iteratively refines the code. This process not only
transforms an ambiguous perceptual task into a verifiable, symbolic problem,
but also enables precise calculations and logical inferences later on. On
various visual reasoning benchmarks such as CharXiv, ChartQA, and Geometry3K,
RECODE significantly outperforms methods that do not leverage code or only use
code for drawing auxiliary lines or cropping. Our work demonstrates that
grounding visual perception in executable code provides a new path toward more
accurate and verifiable multimodal reasoning.

Motivation: 当前的多模态模型基准测试很少真正检验视觉理解和生成能力的整合，要么将这两种能力孤立评估，要么忽略了本质上耦合它们的任务。

Method: 构建了包含八个推理领域（科学、编程、数学、谜题等）的综合性基准测试，每个任务都双向耦合，要求模型利用概念理解指导视觉合成，或利用生成作为分析推理的认知支架。

Result: 通过对最先进的多模态模型进行评估，揭示了显著的性能差距和跨模态依赖性，提供了关于这些能力何时以及如何相互增强的新见解。

Conclusion: Uni-MMMU为推进统一多模态模型建立了可靠的基础，通过可验证的中间推理步骤、独特真实值和可复现的评分协议来评估文本和视觉输出。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models aim to jointly enable visual understanding and
generation, yet current benchmarks rarely examine their true integration.
Existing evaluations either treat the two abilities in isolation or overlook
tasks that inherently couple them. To address this gap, we present Uni-MMMU, a
comprehensive and discipline-aware benchmark that systematically unfolds the
bidirectional synergy between generation and understanding across eight
reasoning-centric domains, including science, coding, mathematics, and puzzles.
Each task is bidirectionally coupled, demanding models to (i) leverage
conceptual understanding to guide precise visual synthesis, or (ii) utilize
generation as a cognitive scaffold for analytical reasoning. Uni-MMMU
incorporates verifiable intermediate reasoning steps, unique ground truths, and
a reproducible scoring protocol for both textual and visual outputs. Through
extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art unified, generation-only, and
understanding-only models, we reveal substantial performance disparities and
cross-modal dependencies, offering new insights into when and how these
abilities reinforce one another, and establishing a reliable foundation for
advancing unified models.

Abstract: A key question for adapting modern deep learning architectures to functional
MRI (fMRI) is how to represent the data for model input. To bridge the modality
gap between fMRI and natural images, we transform the 4D volumetric fMRI data
into videos of 2D fMRI activity flat maps. We train Vision Transformers on 2.3K
hours of fMRI flat map videos from the Human Connectome Project using the
spatiotemporal masked autoencoder (MAE) framework. We observe that masked fMRI
modeling performance improves with dataset size according to a strict power
scaling law. Downstream classification benchmarks show that our model learns
rich representations supporting both fine-grained state decoding across
subjects, as well as subject-specific trait decoding across changes in brain
state. This work is part of an ongoing open science project to build foundation
models for fMRI data. Our code and datasets are available at

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决故事续写中如何有效利用历史视觉上下文同时确保与当前文本输入语义对齐的挑战，避免引入误导或不相关信息。

Method: 使用CLIP模型检索语义最相关的历史图像，当无足够相关图像时，在扩散过程早期阶段自适应限制先验视觉的影响，并使用大语言模型重新标注噪声数据集以增强文本监督。

Result: 定量结果和人工评估表明，AVC在连贯性、语义一致性和视觉保真度方面优于强基线方法，特别是在先验视觉与当前输入冲突的挑战性情况下表现更佳。

Conclusion: AVC框架能够有效利用视觉上下文，同时避免不相关信息的干扰，在故事续写任务中实现了更好的性能。

Abstract: Story continuation focuses on generating the next image in a narrative
sequence so that it remains coherent with both the ongoing text description and
the previously observed images. A central challenge in this setting lies in
utilizing prior visual context effectively, while ensuring semantic alignment
with the current textual input. In this work, we introduce AVC (Adaptive Visual
Conditioning), a framework for diffusion-based story continuation. AVC employs
the CLIP model to retrieve the most semantically aligned image from previous
frames. Crucially, when no sufficiently relevant image is found, AVC adaptively
restricts the influence of prior visuals to only the early stages of the
diffusion process. This enables the model to exploit visual context when
beneficial, while avoiding the injection of misleading or irrelevant
information. Furthermore, we improve data quality by re-captioning a noisy
dataset using large language models, thereby strengthening textual supervision
and semantic alignment. Quantitative results and human evaluations demonstrate
that AVC achieves superior coherence, semantic consistency, and visual fidelity
compared to strong baselines, particularly in challenging cases where prior
visuals conflict with the current input.

Conclusion: NoisePrints提供了一种实用且可扩展的解决方案，解决了扩散模型版权保护的关键挑战，同时保持了轻量级和高效性

Abstract: With the rapid adoption of diffusion models for visual content generation,
proving authorship and protecting copyright have become critical. This
challenge is particularly important when model owners keep their models private
and may be unwilling or unable to handle authorship issues, making third-party
verification essential. A natural solution is to embed watermarks for later
verification. However, existing methods require access to model weights and
rely on computationally heavy procedures, rendering them impractical and
non-scalable. To address these challenges, we propose , a lightweight
watermarking scheme that utilizes the random seed used to initialize the
diffusion process as a proof of authorship without modifying the generation
process. Our key observation is that the initial noise derived from a seed is
highly correlated with the generated visual content. By incorporating a hash
function into the noise sampling process, we further ensure that recovering a
valid seed from the content is infeasible. We also show that sampling an
alternative seed that passes verification is infeasible, and demonstrate the
robustness of our method under various manipulations. Finally, we show how to
use cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs to prove ownership without revealing
the seed. By keeping the seed secret, we increase the difficulty of watermark
removal. In our experiments, we validate NoisePrints on multiple
state-of-the-art diffusion models for images and videos, demonstrating
efficient verification using only the seed and output, without requiring access
to model weights.

TL;DR: 提出了Honey-Data-15M数据集和HoneyPipe数据清洗管道，通过高质量数据训练出性能优异的8B参数开源多模态大模型Bee-8B，在多项任务上达到或超越半开源模型水平。


<details>

Conclusion: 通过系统性的数据质量提升方法，可以开发出具有竞争力的完全开源多模态大语言模型，为社区提供了数据集、工具链、训练配方和模型权重等完整资源。

Abstract: Fully open multimodal large language models (MLLMs) currently lag behind
proprietary counterparts, primarily due to a significant gap in data quality
for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Existing open-source datasets are often
plagued by widespread noise and a critical deficit in complex reasoning data,
such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which hinders the development of advanced model
capabilities. Addressing these challenges, our work makes three primary
contributions. First, we introduce Honey-Data-15M, a new SFT dataset comprising
approximately 15 million QA pairs, processed through multiple cleaning
techniques and enhanced with a novel dual-level (short and long) CoT enrichment
strategy. Second, we introduce HoneyPipe, the data curation pipeline, and its
underlying framework DataStudio, providing the community with a transparent and
adaptable methodology for data curation that moves beyond static dataset
releases. Finally, to validate our dataset and pipeline, we train Bee-8B, an 8B
model on Honey-Data-15M. Experiments show that Bee-8B establishes a new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) for fully open MLLMs, achieving performance that is
competitive with, and in some cases surpasses, recent semi-open models such as
InternVL3.5-8B. Our work delivers to the community a suite of foundational
resources, including: the Honey-Data-15M corpus; the full-stack suite
comprising HoneyPipe and DataStudio; training recipes; an evaluation harness;
and the model weights. This effort demonstrates that a principled focus on data
quality is a key pathway to developing fully open MLLMs that are highly
competitive with their semi-open counterparts.

TL;DR: 提出了GS-Reasoner模型，通过双路径池化机制构建统一的3D表示，实现无需外部模块的自回归3D视觉定位，并显著提升空间推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D LLMs缺乏能够同时捕捉语义和几何信息的统一3D表示，导致定位性能差或过度依赖外部模块，阻碍了定位与空间推理的无缝集成。

Method: 提出双路径池化机制，将几何特征与语义和位置线索紧密对齐，构建基于图像块的统一3D表示；引入GCoT数据集，包含3D边界框标注和集成定位的推理路径。

Result: GS-Reasoner在3D视觉定位上取得显著成果，无需外部模块即可实现自回归定位，性能与最先进模型相当，并显著提升了空间推理能力。

Conclusion: GS-Reasoner建立了统一且自包含的3D空间推理框架，证明3D视觉定位是空间推理的基石，通过紧密集成定位与推理实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we claim that 3D visual grounding is the cornerstone of
spatial reasoning and introduce the Grounded-Spatial Reasoner (GS-Reasoner) to
explore the effective spatial representations that bridge the gap between them.
Existing 3D LLMs suffer from the absence of a unified 3D representation capable
of jointly capturing semantic and geometric information. This deficiency is
manifested either in poor performance on grounding or in an excessive reliance
on external modules, ultimately hindering the seamless integration of grounding
and spatial reasoning. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective
dual-path pooling mechanism that tightly aligns geometric features with both
semantic and positional cues, constructing a unified image patch-based 3D
representation that encapsulates all essential information without increasing
the number of input tokens. Leveraging this holistic representation,
GS-Reasoner is the first 3D LLM that achieves autoregressive grounding entirely
without external modules while delivering performance comparable to
state-of-the-art models, establishing a unified and self-contained framework
for 3D spatial reasoning. To further bridge grounding and spatial reasoning, we
introduce the Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) dataset. This dataset is
meticulously curated to include both 3D bounding box annotations for objects
referenced in reasoning questions and step-by-step reasoning paths that
integrate grounding as a core component of the problem-solving process.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that GS-Reasoner achieves impressive results
on 3D visual grounding, which in turn significantly enhances its spatial
reasoning capabilities, leading to state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 提出Trajectory Field表示方法，将视频表示为密集的3D轨迹场，并开发Trace Anything神经网络单次前向预测整个轨迹场，在轨迹估计基准上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频中的像素随时间形成连续3D轨迹，是动态的基本单元。基于此原理，需要一种有效表示方法来建模和理解视频动态。

Method: 将视频表示为轨迹场，为每个像素分配连续3D轨迹函数。Trace Anything模型单次前向预测每个像素的控制点，参数化B样条轨迹。

Result: 在轨迹场估计新基准上达到SOTA性能，在点跟踪基准上表现竞争力；效率显著提升；展现目标条件操作、运动预测等涌现能力。

Conclusion: 轨迹场表示和Trace Anything模型为视频动态建模提供了有效解决方案，具有高效性和多种应用潜力。

Abstract: Effective spatio-temporal representation is fundamental to modeling,
understanding, and predicting dynamics in videos. The atomic unit of a video,
the pixel, traces a continuous 3D trajectory over time, serving as the
primitive element of dynamics. Based on this principle, we propose representing
any video as a Trajectory Field: a dense mapping that assigns a continuous 3D
trajectory function of time to each pixel in every frame. With this
representation, we introduce Trace Anything, a neural network that predicts the
entire trajectory field in a single feed-forward pass. Specifically, for each
pixel in each frame, our model predicts a set of control points that
parameterizes a trajectory (i.e., a B-spline), yielding its 3D position at
arbitrary query time instants. We trained the Trace Anything model on
large-scale 4D data, including data from our new platform, and our experiments
demonstrate that: (i) Trace Anything achieves state-of-the-art performance on
our new benchmark for trajectory field estimation and performs competitively on
established point-tracking benchmarks; (ii) it offers significant efficiency
gains thanks to its one-pass paradigm, without requiring iterative optimization
or auxiliary estimators; and (iii) it exhibits emergent abilities, including
goal-conditioned manipulation, motion forecasting, and spatio-temporal fusion.

TL;DR: VisCoP通过向视觉编码器添加可学习的视觉探针，实现高效领域自适应，在跨视图、跨模态和跨任务场景中优于现有方法，同时保留源域知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在遇到与预训练数据分布差异大的新领域时性能急剧下降，现有领域自适应方法要么学习有限领域特征，要么导致灾难性遗忘。

Method: 提出视觉上下文探针(VisCoP)，在视觉编码器中添加少量可学习的视觉探针，实现高效领域特定适应，最小化对预训练参数的修改。

Result: 在跨视图、跨模态和跨任务三个挑战性领域自适应设置中，VisCoP始终优于现有适应策略，在目标域获得优越性能并有效保留源域知识。

Conclusion: VisCoP通过视觉探针机制提供了一种高效且有效的领域自适应方法，解决了现有方法在领域特定特征学习和知识保留方面的局限性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at general visual reasoning tasks
but exhibit sharp performance degradation when applied to novel domains with
substantial distribution shifts from pretraining data. Existing domain
adaptation approaches finetune different VLM components, but this often results
in limited domain-specific feature learning or catastrophic forgetting of prior
capabilities. To address these issues, we introduce Vision Contextualized
Probing (VisCoP), which augments the VLM's vision encoder with a compact set of
learnable visual probes. These probes enable efficient domain-specific
adaptation with minimal modification to pretrained parameters. We evaluate
VisCoP across three challenging domain adaptation settings-cross-view
(exocentric to egocentric), cross-modal (RGB to depth), and cross-task (human
understanding to robot control). Experiments show that VisCoP consistently
outperforms existing adaptation strategies, achieving superior performance on
target domains while effectively retaining source-domain knowledge.

TL;DR: PhysMaster通过物理表征学习和强化学习增强视频生成模型的物理意识，使其生成符合物理定律的视频


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成模型虽然能生成视觉上逼真的视频，但往往违反物理定律，限制了其作为'世界模型'的能力

Method: 基于图像到视频任务，设计PhysEncoder从输入图像中提取物理信息作为条件，并应用基于人类反馈的强化学习来优化物理表征

Result: PhysMaster在简单代理任务上证明了其物理意识能力，并能泛化到广泛的物理场景

Conclusion: PhysMaster通过强化学习范式中的表征学习统一了各种物理过程的解决方案，可作为通用插件式解决方案用于物理感知视频生成

Abstract: Video generation models nowadays are capable of generating visually realistic
videos, but often fail to adhere to physical laws, limiting their ability to
generate physically plausible videos and serve as ''world models''. To address
this issue, we propose PhysMaster, which captures physical knowledge as a
representation for guiding video generation models to enhance their
physics-awareness. Specifically, PhysMaster is based on the image-to-video task
where the model is expected to predict physically plausible dynamics from the
input image. Since the input image provides physical priors like relative
positions and potential interactions of objects in the scenario, we devise
PhysEncoder to encode physical information from it as an extra condition to
inject physical knowledge into the video generation process. The lack of proper
supervision on the model's physical performance beyond mere appearance
motivates PhysEncoder to apply reinforcement learning with human feedback to
physical representation learning, which leverages feedback from generation
models to optimize physical representations with Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) in an end-to-end manner. PhysMaster provides a feasible solution for
improving physics-awareness of PhysEncoder and thus of video generation,
proving its ability on a simple proxy task and generalizability to wide-ranging
physical scenarios. This implies that our PhysMaster, which unifies solutions
for various physical processes via representation learning in the reinforcement
learning paradigm, can act as a generic and plug-in solution for physics-aware
video generation and broader applications.
