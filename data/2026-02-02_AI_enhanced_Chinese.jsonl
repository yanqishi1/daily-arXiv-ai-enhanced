This paper investigates drunk language, i.e., text written under the influence of alcohol, as a driver for safety failures in large language models (LLMs). We investigate three mechanisms for inducing drunk language in LLMs: persona-based prompting, causal fine-tuning, and reinforcement-based post-training. When evaluated on 5 LLMs, we observe a higher susceptibility to jailbreaking on JailbreakBench (even in the presence of defences) and privacy leaks on ConfAIde, where both benchmarks are in English, as compared to the base LLMs as well as previously reported approaches. Via a robust combination of manual evaluation and LLM-based evaluators and analysis of error categories, our findings highlight a correspondence between human-intoxicated behaviour, and anthropomorphism in LLMs induced with drunk language. The simplicity and efficiency of our drunk language inducement approaches position them as potential counters for LLM safety tuning, highlighting significant risks to LLM safety.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\"\u9189\u9152\u8bed\u8a00\"\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u8bf1\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u9152\u7cbe\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u826f\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u4e5f\u4f1a\u53d7\u5230\u7c7b\u4f3c\"\u9189\u9152\u8bed\u8a00\"\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u8bf1\u5bfc\u9189\u9152\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u57285\u4e2aLLM\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528JailbreakBench\u548cConfAIde\u4e24\u4e2a\u82f1\u6587\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u548cLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u5206\u6790\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u522b\u3002", "result": "\u9189\u9152\u8bed\u8a00\u8bf1\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86LLM\u5bf9\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6613\u611f\u6027\uff08\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff09\u548c\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5148\u524d\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u9189\u9152\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u901a\u8fc7\u9189\u9152\u8bed\u8a00\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684LLM\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bf1\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6297LLM\u5b89\u5168\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u7a81\u663e\u4e86LLM\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u91cd\u5927\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

Based on this theory, we introduce two training-free extensions, MrRoPE-Uni and MrRoPE-Pro, which leverage uniform and progressive radix conversion strategies, respectively, to achieve 'train short, test long' generalization. Without fine-tuning, MrRoPE-Pro sustains over 85% recall in the 128K-context Needle-in-a-Haystack test and achieves more than double YaRN's accuracy on Infinite-Bench retrieval and dialogue subsets.

At test time, collaborative reasoning through Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as a promising approach for enhancing LLM performance. However, current RLVR methods typically train LLMs to solve problems in isolation, without explicitly preparing them to synthesize and benefit from different rationales that arise during debate. In this work, we propose Self-Debate Reinforcement Learning (SDRL), a training framework that equips a single LLM with strong standalone problem-solving ability and the capability to learn from diverse reasoning trajectories in MAD. Given a prompt, SDRL first samples multiple candidate solutions, then constructs a debate context with diverse reasoning paths and generates second-turn responses conditioned on this context. Finally, SDRL jointly optimizes both the initial and debate-conditioned responses, yielding a model that is effective as both a standalone solver and a debate participant.

Large language models (LLMs) have recently enabled substantial progress in automated veracity assessment, including automated fact-checking and claim verification systems. Typical veracity assessment pipelines break down complex claims into sub-claims, retrieve external evidence, and then apply LLM reasoning to assess veracity. However, existing methods often treat evidence retrieval as a static, isolated step and do not effectively manage or reuse retrieved evidence across claims. In this work, we propose MERMAID, a memory-enhanced multi-agent veracity assessment framework that tightly couples the retrieval and reasoning processes. MERMAID integrates agent-driven search, structured knowledge representations, and a persistent memory module within a Reason-Action style iterative process, enabling dynamic evidence acquisition and cross-claim evidence reuse.

We present the first systematic benchmark evaluating five state-of-the-art OVD models on the LAE-80C aerial dataset (3,592 images, 80 categories) under strict zero-shot conditions. Our experimental protocol isolates semantic confusion from visual localization through Global, Oracle, and Single-Category inference modes. Results reveal severe domain transfer failure: the best model (OWLv2) achieves only 27.6% F1-score with 69% false positive rate. Critically, reducing vocabulary size from 80 to 3.2 classes yields 15x improvement, demonstrating that semantic confusion is the primary bottleneck. Prompt engineering strategies such as domain-specific prefixing and synonym expansion, fail to provide meaningful performance gains.

Language models can also adapt to diverse tasks and learn new structure in context, and recent work has shown that this in-context learning (ICL) can be reflected in representational changes. Here we bring these two lines of research together to explore whether representation straightening occurs \\emph{within} a context during ICL. We measure representational straightening in Gemma 2 models across a diverse set of in-context tasks, and uncover a dichotomy in how LLMs' representations change in context. In continual prediction settings (e.g., natural language, grid world traversal tasks) we observe that increasing context increases the straightness of neural sequence trajectories, which is correlated with improvement in model prediction. Conversely, in structured prediction settings (e.g., few-shot tasks), straightening is inconsistent -- it is only present in phases of the task with explicit structure (e.g., repeating a template), but vanishes elsewhere. These results suggest that ICL is not a monolithic process. Instead, we propose that LLMs function like a Swiss Army knife: depending on task structure, the LLM dynamically selects between strategies, only some of which yield representational straightening.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u53d8\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f1a\u968f\u7740\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u76f4\uff0c\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u800c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8868\u5f81\u53d8\u76f4\u73b0\u8c61\u53ea\u5728\u6709\u660e\u786e\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u9636\u6bb5\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u8868\u660eICL\u4e0d\u662f\u5355\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u800c\u662fLLMs\u6839\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u7ed3\u6784\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u63a2\u7d22LLMs\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ICL\uff09\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u8868\u5f81\u53d8\u76f4\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660eLLMs\u5728\u6df1\u5c42\u4f1a\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6210\u66f4\u76f4\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u8fd9\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u5916\u63a8\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0cLLMs\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u5e76\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e24\u6761\u7814\u7a76\u7ebf\u7ed3\u5408\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76ICL\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8868\u5f81\u53d8\u76f4\u662f\u5426\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5185\u90e8\u53d1\u751f\u3002", "method": "\u5728Gemma 2\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u53d8\u76f4\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff1a1\uff09\u8fde\u7eed\u9884\u6d4b\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff08\u5982\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u7f51\u683c\u4e16\u754c\u904d\u5386\u4efb\u52a1\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff08\u5982\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u9636\u6bb5\u4e2d\u795e\u7ecf\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u76f4\u7ebf\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76LLMs\u5728ICL\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u53d8\u5316\u5b58\u5728\u4e8c\u5206\u73b0\u8c61\uff1a\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u5e8f\u5217\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u76f4\u7ebf\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u800c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8868\u5f81\u53d8\u76f4\u73b0\u8c61\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u2014\u2014\u53ea\u5728\u5177\u6709\u660e\u786e\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u5982\u91cd\u590d\u6a21\u677f\uff09\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u9636\u6bb5\u5219\u6d88\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u662f\u5355\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0cLLMs\u66f4\u50cf\u745e\u58eb\u519b\u5200\uff1a\u6839\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u7ed3\u6784\uff0cLLMs\u4f1a\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u53ea\u6709\u90e8\u5206\u7b56\u7565\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u8868\u5f81\u53d8\u76f4\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660eLLMs\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u7075\u6d3b\u8c03\u6574\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u5904\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

However, most VQA datasets focus on real-world images or simple diagrammatic analysis, with few focused on interpreting complex scientific charts. Indeed, many VQA datasets that analyze charts do not contain the underlying data behind those charts or assume a 1-to-1 correspondence between chart marks and underlying data. In reality, charts are transformations (i.e. analysis, simplification, modification) of data. This distinction introduces a reasoning challenge in VQA that the current datasets do not capture. In this paper, we argue for a dedicated VQA benchmark for scientific charts where there is no 1-to-1 correspondence between chart marks and underlying data.

We then generate synthetic histogram charts based on ground truth data, and ask both humans and a large reasoning model questions where precise answers depend on access to the underlying data.

We argue these should be treated jointly. Across two clinical tasks (MedAlign applicability/correctness and MS subtype abstraction) and multiple open and proprietary models, we measure prompt sensitivity via flip rates and relate it to calibration and selective prediction. We find that higher accuracy does not guarantee prompt stability, and that models can appear well-calibrated yet remain fragile to paraphrases. We propose a dual-objective prompt optimization loop that jointly targets accuracy and stability, showing that explicitly including a stability term reduces flip rates across tasks and models, sometimes at modest accuracy cost.

We introduce VRRPI-Bench, a benchmark derived from unlabeled egocentric videos with verbalized annotations of relative camera motion, reflecting realistic scenarios with simultaneous translation and rotation around a shared object. We further propose VRRPI-Diag, a diagnostic benchmark that isolates individual motion degrees of freedom. Despite the simplicity of RCPE, most VLMs fail to generalize beyond shallow 2D heuristics, particularly for depth changes and roll transformations along the optical axis. Even state-of-the-art models such as GPT-5 ($0.64$) fall short of classic geometric baselines ($0.97$) and human performance ($0.92$).

To address these limitations, we introduce Sparse Plus Linear Attention (SPLA), a framework that utilizes a selection metric derived from second-order Taylor expansions to accurately identify relevant blocks for exact attention. Instead of discarding the remaining \"long tail,\" SPLA compresses unselected blocks into a compact recurrent state via a residual linear attention (RLA) module. Crucially, to avoid IO overhead, we derive an optimized subtraction-based formulation for RLA -- calculating the residual as the difference between global and selected linear attention -- ensuring that unselected blocks are never explicitly accessed during inference. Our experiments demonstrate that SPLA closes the performance gap in continual pretraining, surpassing dense attention models on long-context benchmarks like RULER while maintaining competitive general knowledge and reasoning capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "SPLA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8c\u9636\u6cf0\u52d2\u5c55\u5f00\u9009\u62e9\u76f8\u5173\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u786e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u6b8b\u5dee\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u538b\u7f29\u672a\u9009\u4e2d\u5757\uff0c\u907f\u514dIO\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u5bc6\u96c6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5757\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u9009\u62e9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4f4e\u548c\u7d2f\u79ef\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e22\u5931\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b8c\u5168\u4e22\u5f03\u672a\u9009\u4e2d\u7684\u5757\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u9009\u62e9\u76f8\u5173\u5757\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\u672a\u9009\u4e2d\u5757\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSPLA\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u4e8c\u9636\u6cf0\u52d2\u5c55\u5f00\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u51c6\u786e\u9009\u62e9\u76f8\u5173\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u786e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u538b\u7f29\u672a\u9009\u4e2d\u5757\u4e3a\u7d27\u51d1\u5faa\u73af\u72b6\u6001\uff1b3\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u51cf\u6cd5\u516c\u5f0f\u907f\u514dIO\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u4e0e\u9009\u4e2d\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u5dee\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6b8b\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7f29\u5c0f\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5728RULER\u7b49\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u5bc6\u96c6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "SPLA\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7cbe\u786e\u5757\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u7ebf\u6027\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5757\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e22\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Code available at : https://github.com/wiskott-lab/single-vs-hier-recon", "summary": "Vector-quantized variational autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are central to models that rely on high reconstruction fidelity, from neural compression to generative pipelines. Hierarchical extensions, such as VQ-VAE2, are often credited with superior reconstruction performance because they split global and local features across multiple levels. However, since higher levels derive all their information from lower levels, they should not carry additional reconstructive content beyond what the lower-level already encodes. Combined with recent advances in training objectives and quantization mechanisms, this leads us to ask whether a single-level VQ-VAE, with matched representational budget and no codebook collapse, can equal the reconstruction fidelity of its hierarchical counterpart. Although the multi-scale structure of hierarchical models may improve perceptual quality in downstream tasks, the effect of hierarchy on reconstruction accuracy, isolated from codebook utilization and overall representational capacity, remains empirically underexamined. We revisit this question by comparing a two-level VQ-VAE and a capacity-matched single-level model on high-resolution ImageNet images. Consistent with prior observations, we confirm that inadequate codebook utilization limits single-level VQ-VAEs and that overly high-dimensional embeddings destabilize quantization and increase codebook collapse. We show that lightweight interventions such as initialization from data, periodic reset of inactive codebook vectors, and systematic tuning of codebook hyperparameters significantly reduce collapse. Our results demonstrate that when representational budgets are matched, and codebook collapse is mitigated, single-level VQ-VAEs can match the reconstruction fidelity of hierarchical variants, challenging the assumption that hierarchical quantization is inherently superior for high-quality reconstructions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5355\u5c42VQ-VAE\u5728\u5339\u914d\u8868\u5f81\u9884\u7b97\u548c\u907f\u514d\u7801\u4e66\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5206\u5c42VQ-VAE\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u5206\u5c42\u91cf\u5316\u5728\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u56fa\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u5c42VQ-VAE\u662f\u5426\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u771f\u7684\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u5c42VQ-VAE\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5339\u914d\u8868\u5f81\u9884\u7b97\u548c\u907f\u514d\u7801\u4e66\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5f80\u5f80\u5c06\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u91cd\u5efa\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\u6df7\u4e3a\u4e00\u8c08\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u672c\u8eab\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u68c0\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u5c42VQ-VAE\u4e0e\u5bb9\u91cf\u5339\u914d\u7684\u5355\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387ImageNet\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\uff1a\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u3001\u5b9a\u671f\u91cd\u7f6e\u4e0d\u6d3b\u8dc3\u7801\u4e66\u5411\u91cf\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u8c03\u6574\u7801\u4e66\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u7801\u4e66\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u8868\u5f81\u9884\u7b97\u5339\u914d\u4e14\u7801\u4e66\u5d29\u6e83\u5f97\u5230\u7f13\u89e3\u65f6\uff0c\u5355\u5c42VQ-VAE\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5206\u5c42\u53d8\u4f53\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\u7684\u7801\u4e66\u5229\u7528\u4f1a\u9650\u5236\u5355\u5c42VQ-VAE\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u91cf\u5316\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5e76\u589e\u52a0\u7801\u4e66\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u5c42\u91cf\u5316\u5728\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u9762\u5e76\u4e0d\u5177\u6709\u56fa\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u5728\u5339\u914d\u8868\u5f81\u9884\u7b97\u548c\u6709\u6548\u7ba1\u7406\u7801\u4e66\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5355\u5c42VQ-VAE\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5206\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5047\u8bbe\u3002"}}

This paper evaluates single-agent and multi-agent LLM architectures for essay grading using the ASAP 2.0 corpus. Our multi-agent system decomposes grading into three specialist agents (Content, Structure, Language) coordinated by a Chairman Agent that implements rubric-aligned logic including veto rules and score capping. We test both architectures in zero-shot and few-shot conditions using GPT-5.1. Results show that the multi-agent system is significantly better at identifying weak essays while the single-agent system performs better on mid-range essays. Both architectures struggle with high-quality essays. Critically, few-shot calibration emerges as the dominant factor in system performance -- providing just two examples per score level improves QWK by approximately 26% for both architectures. These findings suggest architectural choice should align with specific deployment priorities, with multi-agent AI particularly suited for diagnostic screening of at-risk students, while single-agent models provide a cost-effective solution for general assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u4f5c\u6587\u8bc4\u5206\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u5f31\u4f5c\u6587\u65b9\u9762\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e2d\u6863\u4f5c\u6587\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u4f5c\u6587\u4e0a\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5c11\u91cf\u793a\u4f8b\u6821\u51c6\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u81ea\u52a8\u4f5c\u6587\u8bc4\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u5173\u4e8e\u67b6\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u540c\u8d28\u91cf\u6c34\u5e73\u4f5c\u6587\u8bc4\u5206\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u5f88\u7f3a\u4e4f\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u4f5c\u6587\u8bc4\u5206\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528ASAP 2.0\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e24\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c06\u8bc4\u5206\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e13\u4e1a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff08\u5185\u5bb9\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\uff09\uff0c\u7531\u4e3b\u5e2d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u5b9e\u65bd\u4e0e\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5426\u51b3\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u5206\u6570\u4e0a\u9650\u3002\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4f7f\u7528GPT-5.1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e24\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u5f31\u4f5c\u6587\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u800c\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e2d\u6863\u4f5c\u6587\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u4f5c\u6587\u4e0a\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u6821\u51c6\u662f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u4e3b\u5bfc\u56e0\u7d20\u2014\u2014\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5206\u6570\u7ea7\u522b\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e24\u4e2a\u793a\u4f8b\u5c31\u80fd\u5c06QWK\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ea626%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u67b6\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u5e94\u4e0e\u5177\u4f53\u90e8\u7f72\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u5bf9\u6709\u98ce\u9669\u5b66\u751f\u8fdb\u884c\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u7b5b\u67e5\uff0c\u800c\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u4e00\u822c\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u9ad8\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u6821\u51c6\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

We find that the highly sparse spatio-temporal attention patterns exhibited in Video DiTs can be naturally represented by the Monarch matrix. It is a class of structured matrices with flexible sparsity, enabling sub-quadratic attention via an alternating minimization algorithm. Accordingly, we propose VMonarch, a novel attention mechanism for Video DiTs that enables efficient computation over the dynamic sparse patterns with structured Monarch matrices. First, we adapt spatio-temporal Monarch factorization to explicitly capture the intra-frame and inter-frame correlations of the video data. Second, we introduce a recomputation strategy to mitigate artifacts arising from instabilities during alternating minimization of Monarch matrices. Third, we propose a novel online entropy algorithm fused into FlashAttention, enabling fast Monarch matrix updates for long sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VMonarch achieves comparable or superior generation quality to full attention on VBench after minimal tuning. It overcomes the attention bottleneck in Video DiTs, reduces attention FLOPs by a factor of 17.5, and achieves a speedup of over 5x in attention computation for long videos, surpassing state-of-the-art sparse attention methods at 90% sparsity.", "AI": {"tldr": "VMonarch\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eMonarch\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u4e2d\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7a00\u758f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e9a\u4e8c\u6b21\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u5904\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08Video DiTs\uff09\u4e2d\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e25\u91cd\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u89c6\u9891DiTs\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7Monarch\u77e9\u9635\u81ea\u7136\u8868\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVMonarch\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff1a1\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u65f6\u7a7aMonarch\u5206\u89e3\u663e\u5f0f\u6355\u6349\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5e27\u5185\u548c\u5e27\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u91cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b56\u7565\u7f13\u89e3Monarch\u77e9\u9635\u4ea4\u66ff\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f2a\u5f71\uff1b3\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u878d\u5408\u5230FlashAttention\u4e2d\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5728\u7ebf\u71b5\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u5feb\u901fMonarch\u77e9\u9635\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "VMonarch\u5728VBench\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5b8c\u6574\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6ce8\u610f\u529bFLOPs 17.5\u500d\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u8fc75\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u572890%\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u8d85\u8d8a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "VMonarch\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316Monarch\u77e9\u9635\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u89c6\u9891DiTs\u4e2d\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7a00\u758f\u6a21\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u5904\u7406\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

We conceptualize and produce LLM-generated personas based on a set of interpretable WVS-derived variables, and we examine the generated personas through three complementary lenses: positioning on the Inglehart-Welzel map, which unveils their interpretation reflecting stable differences across cultural conditionings; demographic-level consistency with the World Values Survey, where response distributions broadly track human group patterns; and moral profiles derived from a Moral Foundations questionnaire, which we analyze through a culture-to-morality mapping to characterize how moral responses vary across different cultural configurations. Our approach of culturally-grounded persona generation and analysis enables evaluation of cross-cultural structure and moral variation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6587\u5316\u57fa\u7840\u4eba\u7269\u89d2\u8272\u662f\u5426\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u4e0d\u540c\u6587\u5316\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u89c2\u548c\u9053\u5fb7\u4ef7\u503c\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e16\u754c\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u8c03\u67e5\u3001\u82f1\u683c\u5c14\u54c8\u7279-\u97e6\u5c14\u6cfd\u6587\u5316\u5730\u56fe\u548c\u9053\u5fb7\u57fa\u7840\u7406\u8bba\u4e09\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u65b9\u9762\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u6709\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5408\u6210\u4eba\u7269\u89d2\u8272\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6587\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u4e16\u754c\u548c\u9053\u5fb7\u4ef7\u503c\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4ecd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u3002\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6587\u5316\u57fa\u7840\u4eba\u7269\u89d2\u8272\u662f\u5426\u4e0e\u65e2\u5b9a\u7684\u6587\u5316\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u6846\u67b6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e16\u754c\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u8c03\u67e5\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u53d8\u91cf\u6982\u5ff5\u5316\u548c\u751f\u6210LLM\u4eba\u7269\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u89c6\u89d2\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff1a1) \u5728\u82f1\u683c\u5c14\u54c8\u7279-\u97e6\u5c14\u6cfd\u6587\u5316\u5730\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff1b2) \u4e0e\u4e16\u754c\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u8c03\u67e5\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5c42\u9762\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc7\u9053\u5fb7\u57fa\u7840\u95ee\u5377\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6587\u5316\u5230\u9053\u5fb7\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u6765\u8868\u5f81\u4e0d\u540c\u6587\u5316\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u53cd\u5e94\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1) \u751f\u6210\u7684\u4eba\u7269\u89d2\u8272\u5728\u82f1\u683c\u5c14\u54c8\u7279-\u97e6\u5c14\u6cfd\u5730\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u6587\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u95f4\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b2) \u54cd\u5e94\u5206\u5e03\u603b\u4f53\u4e0a\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4eba\u7c7b\u7fa4\u4f53\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e0e\u4e16\u754c\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u8c03\u67e5\u5177\u6709\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b3) \u9053\u5fb7\u53cd\u5e94\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6587\u5316\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5448\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6587\u5316\u57fa\u7840\u4eba\u7269\u89d2\u8272\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u9053\u5fb7\u53d8\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3LLM\u6a21\u62df\u4e0d\u540c\u6587\u5316\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

We present C2R (Coarse-to-Real), a generative rendering framework that synthesizes real-style urban crowd videos from coarse 3D simulations. Our approach uses coarse 3D renderings to explicitly control scene layout, camera motion, and human trajectories, while a learned neural renderer generates realistic appearance, lighting, and fine-scale dynamics guided by text prompts. To overcome the lack of paired training data between coarse simulations and real videos, we adopt a two-phase mixed CG-real training strategy that learns a strong generative prior from large-scale real footage and introduces controllability through shared implicit spatio-temporal features across domains. The resulting system supports coarse-to-fine control, generalizes across diverse CG and game inputs, and produces temporally consistent, controllable, and realistic urban scene videos from minimal 3D input.

However, we identify a significant limitation we term ''Spectral Rigidity'': standard RoPE utilizes a fixed geometric decay ($\u03b8^{-i}$) optimized for local syntactic coherence, which fails to capture the long-range, periodic structures inherent in recursive logic and algorithmic reasoning. This results in a ''Structure Gap'', where models trained on shallow reasoning chains fail to extrapolate to deeper recursive steps. In this work, we introduce Bifocal Attention, an architectural paradigm that decouples positional encoding into two distinct modalities: Geometric Eyes (Standard RoPE) for precise token-level manipulation, and Spectral Eyes (Learnable Harmonic Operators) for tracking long-range recursive depth. We propose a novel training protocol, Spectral Evolution, which initializes positional frequencies as static geometric parameters but allows them to evolve via gradient descent into a harmonic basis optimized for the specific algorithmic topology of the task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faBifocal Attention\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u773c\u548c\u9891\u8c31\u773c\u5206\u79bb\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6807\u51c6RoPE\u5728\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u9012\u5f52\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u521a\u6027\u9650\u5236", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6RoPE\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u9002\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u53e5\u6cd5\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u9012\u5f52\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u5468\u671f\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d45\u5c42\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u65e0\u6cd5\u5916\u63a8\u5230\u66f4\u6df1\u9012\u5f52\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\"\u7ed3\u6784\u9e3f\u6c9f\"\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBifocal Attention\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\uff1a\u51e0\u4f55\u773c\uff08\u6807\u51c6RoPE\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u7cbe\u786e\u7684token\u7ea7\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u9891\u8c31\u773c\uff08\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8c10\u6ce2\u7b97\u5b50\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u9012\u5f52\u6df1\u5ea6\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51faSpectral Evolution\u8bad\u7ec3\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5c06\u4f4d\u7f6e\u9891\u7387\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\u51e0\u4f55\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u5141\u8bb8\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u6f14\u5316\u4e3a\u9488\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7b97\u6cd5\u62d3\u6251\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8c10\u6ce2\u57fa", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u672a\u63d0\u4f9b\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u4ece\u65b9\u6cd5\u63cf\u8ff0\u770b\uff0c\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u6807\u51c6RoPE\u5728\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u9012\u5f52\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u9891\u8c31\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u5141\u8bb8\u9891\u7387\u53c2\u6570\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6355\u6349\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u9012\u5f52\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6807\u51c6RoPE\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u521a\u6027\u9650\u5236"}}

We introduce FlexMap, unlike prior methods that are fixed to a specific N-camera rig, our approach adapts to variable camera configurations without any architectural changes or per-configuration retraining. Our key innovation eliminates explicit geometric projections by using a geometry-aware foundation model with cross-frame attention to implicitly encode 3D scene understanding in feature space. FlexMap features two core components: a spatial-temporal enhancement module that separates cross-view spatial reasoning from temporal dynamics, and a camera-aware decoder with latent camera tokens, enabling view-adaptive attention without the need for projection matrices. Experiments demonstrate that FlexMap outperforms existing methods across multiple configurations while maintaining robustness to missing views and sensor variations, enabling more practical real-world deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlexMap\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53ef\u53d8\u76f8\u673a\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u9ad8\u6e05\u5730\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7279\u5b9a\u76f8\u673a\u914d\u7f6e\u6216\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u9690\u5f0f\u7f16\u78013D\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u9ad8\u6e05\u5730\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u591a\u76f8\u673a\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c2D\u5230BEV\u7684\u663e\u5f0f/\u9690\u5f0f\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u5f53\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6545\u969c\u6216\u4e0d\u540c\u8f66\u8f86\u76f8\u673a\u914d\u7f6e\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u53d8\u5f97\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u5e27\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9690\u5f0f\u7f16\u78013D\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u65f6\u7a7a\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u5206\u79bb\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u65f6\u5e8f\u52a8\u6001\uff09\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u611f\u77e5\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u76f8\u673a\u4ee4\u724c\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c6\u56fe\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff09\u3002", "result": "FlexMap\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u7f3a\u5931\u89c6\u56fe\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "conclusion": "FlexMap\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u663e\u5f0f\u51e0\u4f55\u6295\u5f71\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u53ef\u53d8\u76f8\u673a\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6e05\u5730\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

To further increase attack success rates (ASR), we propose a ReAct-driven adaptive noising mechanism that iteratively perturbs input images based on model feedback.

However, the clinical implementation and trust of multi-view markerless motion capture (MMMC) require that, in addition to being accurate, these systems produce reliable confidence intervals to indicate how accurate they are for any individual. Building on our prior work utilizing variational inference to estimate joint angle posterior distributions, this study evaluates the calibration and reliability of a probabilistic MMMC method. We analyzed data from 68 participants across two institutions, validating the model against an instrumented walkway and standard marker-based motion capture. We measured the calibration of the confidence intervals using the Expected Calibration Error (ECE). The model demonstrated reliable calibration, yielding ECE values generally < 0.1 for both step and stride length and bias-corrected gait kinematics. We observed a median step and stride length error of ~16 mm and ~12 mm respectively, with median bias-corrected kinematic errors ranging from 1.5 to 3.8 degrees across lower extremity joints. Consistent with the calibrated ECE, the magnitude of the model's predicted uncertainty correlated strongly with observed error measures. These findings indicate that, as designed, the probabilistic model reconstruction quantifies epistemic uncertainty, allowing it to identify unreliable outputs without the need for concurrent ground-truth instrumentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d8\u5206\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u6982\u7387\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u65e0\u6807\u8bb0\u8fd0\u52a8\u6355\u6349\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6b65\u6001\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5730\u9762\u771f\u5b9e\u4eea\u5668\u5373\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u9891\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u65bd\u9700\u8981\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u65e0\u6807\u8bb0\u8fd0\u52a8\u6355\u6349\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u4ec5\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u8fd8\u8981\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u9760\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u6765\u6307\u793a\u4e2a\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u53d8\u5206\u63a8\u65ad\u4f30\u8ba1\u5173\u8282\u89d2\u5ea6\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6982\u7387\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u65e0\u6807\u8bb0\u8fd0\u52a8\u6355\u6349\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u5206\u6790\u6765\u81ea\u4e24\u4e2a\u673a\u678468\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4eea\u5668\u5316\u6b65\u9053\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u6807\u8bb0\u8fd0\u52a8\u6355\u6349\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u671f\u671b\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\u6d4b\u91cf\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u6b65\u957f\u548c\u8de8\u6b65\u957f\u7684\u671f\u671b\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\u503c\u4e00\u822c\u5c0f\u4e8e0.1\uff0c\u504f\u7f6e\u6821\u6b63\u6b65\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u8bef\u5dee\u4e5f\u7c7b\u4f3c\u3002\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6b65\u957f\u8bef\u5dee\u7ea616\u6beb\u7c73\uff0c\u8de8\u6b65\u957f\u8bef\u5dee\u7ea612\u6beb\u7c73\uff0c\u4e0b\u80a2\u5173\u8282\u504f\u7f6e\u6821\u6b63\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u8bef\u5dee\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u57281.5\u52303.8\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u6d4b\u91cf\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u5efa\u80fd\u591f\u91cf\u5316\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u5e76\u53d1\u5730\u9762\u771f\u5b9e\u4eea\u5668\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u65bd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4fe1\u4efb\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Oral presentation", "summary": "Neural language models often struggle with low-resource languages due to the limited availability of training data, making tokens from these languages rare in the training set. This paper addresses a specific challenge during training: rare tokens are disproportionately affected by marginalization, which prevents them from learning effectively. We propose a thresholding technique that reduces the impact of this marginalization, allowing rare tokens to benefit from more meaningful alignment. Through experiments with a character-level language model, we demonstrate that this method significantly improves performance on low-resource language validation data.

Previous work attributes this to LVLMs' over-reliance on language priors and attempts to mitigate it through logits calibration. However, they still lack a thorough analysis of the over-reliance. To gain a deeper understanding of over-reliance, we conduct a series of preliminary experiments, indicating that as the generation length increases, LVLMs' over-reliance on language priors leads to inflated probability of hallucinated object tokens, consequently exacerbating object hallucination. To circumvent this issue, we propose Language-Prior-Free Verification to enable LVLMs to faithfully verify the confidence of object existence. Based on this, we propose a novel training-free Self-Validation Framework to counter the over-reliance trap. It first validates objects' existence in sampled candidate captions and further mitigates object hallucination via caption selection or aggregation. Experiment results demonstrate that our framework mitigates object hallucination significantly in image captioning task (e.g., 65.6% improvement on CHAIRI metric with LLaVA-v1.5-7B), surpassing the previous SOTA methods.

Personal use of this material is permitted. Permission from IEEE must be obtained for all other uses", "summary": "Interactive 3D model texture editing presents enhanced opportunities for creating 3D assets, with freehand drawing style offering the most intuitive experience. However, existing methods primarily support sketch-based interactions for outlining, while the utilization of coarse-grained scribble-based interaction remains limited. Furthermore, current methodologies often encounter challenges due to the abstract nature of scribble instructions, which can result in ambiguous editing intentions and unclear target semantic locations. To address these issues, we propose ScribbleSense, an editing method that combines multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and image generation models to effectively resolve these challenges. We leverage the visual capabilities of MLLMs to predict the editing intent behind the scribbles. Once the semantic intent of the scribble is discerned, we employ globally generated images to extract local texture details, thereby anchoring local semantics and alleviating ambiguities concerning the target semantic locations.

Inference-time guidance methods such as classifier-free and representative guidance enhance semantic alignment by modifying sampling dynamics; however, they do not fully exploit unsupervised feature representations. Although such visual representations contain rich semantic structure, their integration during generation is constrained by the absence of ground-truth reference images at inference. This work reveals semantic drift in the early denoising stages of diffusion transformers, where stochasticity results in inconsistent alignment even under identical conditioning. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a guidance scheme using a representation alignment projector that injects representations predicted by a projector into intermediate sampling steps, providing an effective semantic anchor without modifying the model architecture. Experiments on SiTs and REPAs show notable improvements in class-conditional ImageNet synthesis, achieving substantially lower FID scores; for example, REPA-XL/2 improves from 5.9 to 3.3, and the proposed method outperforms representative guidance when applied to SiT models. The approach further yields complementary gains when combined with classifier-free guidance, demonstrating enhanced semantic coherence and visual fidelity. These results establish representation-informed diffusion sampling as a practical strategy for reinforcing semantic preservation and image consistency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u6295\u5f71\u5668\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u91c7\u6837\u6b65\u9aa4\u6ce8\u5165\u9884\u6d4b\u8868\u793a\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u65e9\u671f\u53bb\u566a\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u65e0\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\uff09\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u3002\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u53bb\u566a\u9636\u6bb5\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u5373\u4f7f\u6761\u4ef6\u76f8\u540c\u4e5f\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u6295\u5f71\u5668\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c06\u6295\u5f71\u5668\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8868\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u5230\u4e2d\u95f4\u91c7\u6837\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\u70b9\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728SiTs\u548cREPAs\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u7c7b\u6761\u4ef6ImageNet\u5408\u6210\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0cFID\u5206\u6570\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\uff08\u5982REPA-XL/2\u4ece5.9\u964d\u81f33.3\uff09\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728SiT\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u4e0e\u65e0\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u4e92\u8865\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8868\u793a\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5f3a\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u589e\u5f3a\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While GMPO improves stability by constraining a conservative objective, it shares a fundamental limitation with GRPO: reliance on a fixed aggregation geometry that ignores the evolving and heterogeneous nature of each trajectory. In this work, we unify these approaches under Power-Mean Policy Optimization (PMPO), a generalized framework that parameterizes the aggregation geometry via the power-mean geometry exponent p. Within this framework, GRPO and GMPO are recovered as special cases. Theoretically, we demonstrate that adjusting p modulates the concentration of gradient updates, effectively reweighting tokens based on their advantage contribution. To determine p adaptively, we introduce a Clip-aware Effective Sample Size (ESS) mechanism. Specifically, we propose a deterministic rule that maps a trajectory clipping fraction to a target ESS. Then, we solve for the specific p to align the trajectory induced ESS with this target one. This allows PMPO to dynamically transition between the aggressive arithmetic mean for reliable trajectories and the conservative geometric mean for unstable ones. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PMPO outperforms strong baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "PMPO\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e42\u5747\u503c\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u8c03\u8282\u7684\u6307\u6570p\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86GRPO\u548cGMPO\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u88c1\u526a\u611f\u77e5\u6709\u6548\u6837\u672c\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u805a\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982GRPO\u548cGMPO\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u805a\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5e42\u5747\u503c\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08PMPO\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e42\u5747\u503c\u51e0\u4f55\u6307\u6570p\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u805a\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u88c1\u526a\u611f\u77e5\u6709\u6548\u6837\u672c\u5927\u5c0f\uff08ESS\uff09\u673a\u5236\u6765\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u786e\u5b9ap\u503c\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u63d0\u51fa\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u89c4\u5219\u5c06\u8f68\u8ff9\u88c1\u526a\u6bd4\u4f8b\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u76ee\u6807ESS\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u6c42\u89e3\u7279\u5b9a\u7684p\u503c\u4f7f\u8f68\u8ff9\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684ESS\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807ESS\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cPMPO\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8c03\u6574p\u53ef\u4ee5\u8c03\u8282\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u96c6\u4e2d\u5ea6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u52bf\u8d21\u732e\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u6743\u6807\u8bb0\u3002", "conclusion": "PMPO\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6fc0\u8fdb\u7b97\u672f\u5747\u503c\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u4fdd\u5b88\u51e0\u4f55\u5747\u503c\u4e4b\u95f4\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8d85\u8d8a\u56fa\u5b9a\u805a\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

HAVC first filters heads through an OCR-based diagnostic task, ensuring that only those with genuine grounding ability are retained. At inference, these heads are further refined using spatial entropy for stronger spatial concentration and gradient sensitivity for predictive contribution. The fused signals produce a reliable Visual Cropping Guidance Map, which highlights the most task-relevant region and guides the cropping of a subimage subsequently provided to the MLLM together with the image-question pair.

In particular, the evolving implicit $\\texttt{EOS}$ density during denoising reveals whether the current masked space is excessive or insufficient, thereby guiding the adjustment direction for generation length. Building on this insight, we propose $\\textbf{$\u03c1$-$\\texttt{EOS}$}$, a training-free, single-stage strategy that enables bidirectional variable-length generation for masked dLLMs. Unlike prior two-stage approaches--which require separate length adjustment and iterative mask insertion phases while supporting only unidirectional expansion--$\\textbf{$\u03c1$-$\\texttt{EOS}$}$ achieves bidirectional length adjustment within a unified denoising process by continuously estimating the implicit $\\texttt{EOS}$ density: excessively high density triggers $\\texttt{MASK}$ token contraction, while insufficient density induces expansion.

However, there are few studies investigating the specific traits related to the powerful generation capacity of LLMs. This paper aims to delve into the generation characteristics exhibited by LLMs. Through our investigation, we have discovered that language models tend to capture target-side keywords at the beginning of the generation process. We name this phenomenon the Holographic Characteristic of language models. For the purpose of exploring this characteristic and further improving the inference efficiency of language models, we propose a plugin called HOLO, which leverages the Holographic Characteristic to extract target-side keywords from language models within a limited number of generation steps and complements the sentence with a parallel lexically constrained text generation method. To verify the effectiveness of HOLO, we conduct massive experiments on language models of varying architectures and scales in the short-text generation scenario. The results demonstrate that HOLO achieves comparable performance to the baselines in terms of both automatic and human-like evaluation metrics and highlight the potential of the Holographic Characteristic.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5168\u606f\u7279\u6027(Holographic Characteristic)\uff0c\u5373\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u521d\u671f\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u6355\u6349\u76ee\u6807\u4fa7\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86HOLO\u63d2\u4ef6\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5176\u5f3a\u5927\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u7279\u5f81\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u7a76\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\"\u5168\u606f\u7279\u6027\"\u2014\u2014\u5728\u751f\u6210\u521d\u671f\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u6355\u6349\u76ee\u6807\u4fa7\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86HOLO\u63d2\u4ef6\uff0c\u8be5\u63d2\u4ef6\u5229\u7528\u5168\u606f\u7279\u6027\u5728\u6709\u9650\u751f\u6210\u6b65\u6570\u5185\u63d0\u53d6\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884c\u8bcd\u6c47\u7ea6\u675f\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u8865\u5145\u53e5\u5b50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u77ed\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eHOLO\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5168\u606f\u7279\u6027\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u786e\u5b9e\u5b58\u5728\u5168\u606f\u7279\u6027\uff0cHOLO\u63d2\u4ef6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e00\u7279\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

A primary limitation of existing approaches is the intrinsic confounding of speaker-specific talking style and semantic content within facial motions, which prevents the faithful transfer of a speaker's unique persona to arbitrary speech. In this paper, we propose MirrorTalk, a generative framework based on a conditional diffusion model, combined with a Semantically-Disentangled Style Encoder (SDSE) that can distill pure style representations from a brief reference video. To effectively utilize this representation, we further introduce a hierarchical modulation strategy within the diffusion process. This mechanism guides the synthesis by dynamically balancing the contributions of audio and style features across distinct facial regions, ensuring both precise lip-sync accuracy and expressive full-face dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MirrorTalk achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of lip-sync accuracy and personalization preservation.", "AI": {"tldr": "MirrorTalk\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u8026\u98ce\u683c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u8c03\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u8138\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5507\u90e8\u540c\u6b65\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u72ec\u7279\u98ce\u683c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u7279\u5b9a\u8bf4\u8bdd\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\u5728\u9762\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e2d\u5185\u5728\u6df7\u6dc6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5c06\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u72ec\u7279\u4e2a\u6027\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5730\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u4efb\u610f\u8bed\u97f3\u4e2d\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5507\u90e8\u540c\u6b65\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMirrorTalk\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff1b2\uff09\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u8026\u98ce\u683c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SDSE\uff09\uff0c\u4ece\u7b80\u77ed\u53c2\u8003\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7eaf\u98ce\u683c\u8868\u793a\uff1b3\uff09\u5206\u5c42\u8c03\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u97f3\u9891\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9762\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMirrorTalk\u5728\u5507\u90e8\u540c\u6b65\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4fdd\u6301\u65b9\u9762\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "MirrorTalk\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u98ce\u683c\u8868\u793a\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u8c03\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8bf4\u8bdd\u98ce\u683c\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\u6df7\u6dc6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u8138\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5507\u90e8\u540c\u6b65\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u98ce\u683c\u3002"}}

Sanity Checking Self-Preference Evaluations", "comment": null, "summary": "Recent research has shown that large language models (LLM) favor own outputs when acting as judges, undermining the integrity of automated post-training and evaluation workflows. However, it is difficult to disentangle which evaluation biases are explained by narcissism versus general experimental confounds, distorting measurements of self-preference bias. We discover a core methodological confound which could reduce measurement error by 89.6%. Specifically, LLM evaluators may deliver self-preferring verdicts when the judge responds to queries which they completed incorrectly themselves; this would be true regardless of whether one of their responses is their own. To decouple self-preference signals from noisy outputs on hard problems, we introduce an Evaluator Quality Baseline, which compares the probability that a judge incorrectly votes for itself against the probability that it votes for an incorrect response from another model. Evaluating this simple baseline on 37,448 queries, only 51% of initial findings retain statistical significance. Finally, we turn towards characterizing the entropy of \"easy\" versus \"hard\" evaluation votes from LLM judges. Our corrective baseline enables future research on self-preference by eliminating noisy data from potential solutions.

Nevertheless, the potential of Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models, despite their unified architecture and efficient inference, remains underexplored. In this work, we present DreamVAR, a novel framework for subject-driven image synthesis built upon a VAR model that employs next-scale prediction. Technically, multi-scale features of the reference subject are first extracted by a visual tokenizer. Instead of interleaving these conditional features with target image tokens across scales, our DreamVAR pre-fills the full subject feature sequence prior to predicting target image tokens.

Computer vision approaches have been applied to BCS prediction, with depth images widely used because they capture geometric information independent of coat color and texture. More recently, three-dimensional point cloud data have attracted increasing interest due to their ability to represent richer geometric characteristics of animal morphology, but direct head-to-head comparisons with depth image-based approaches remain limited. In this study, we compared top-view depth image and point cloud data for BCS prediction under four settings: 1) unsegmented raw data, 2) segmented full-body data, 3) segmented hindquarter data, and 4) handcrafted feature data. Prediction models were evaluated using data from 1,020 dairy cows collected on a commercial farm, with cow-level cross-validation to prevent data leakage. Depth image-based models consistently achieved higher accuracy than point cloud-based models when unsegmented raw data and segmented full-body data were used, whereas comparable performance was observed when segmented hindquarter data were used. Both depth image and point cloud approaches showed reduced accuracy when handcrafted feature data were employed compared with the other settings. Overall, point cloud-based predictions were more sensitive to noise and model architecture than depth image-based predictions. Taken together, these results indicate that three-dimensional point clouds do not provide a consistent advantage over depth images for BCS prediction in dairy cattle under the evaluated conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4fef\u89c6\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u5728\u5976\u725b\u4f53\u51b5\u8bc4\u5206\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u672a\u5206\u5272\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5206\u5272\u5168\u8eab\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u5206\u5272\u540e\u8eaf\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u4e24\u8005\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5976\u725b\u4f53\u51b5\u8bc4\u5206\uff08BCS\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u5f3a\u3001\u52b3\u52a8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5927\u7684\u7f3a\u70b9\u3002\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u65b9\u6cd5\u5df2\u88ab\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eBCS\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u56e0\u5176\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u6bdb\u8272\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u800c\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\uff0c\u4e09\u7ef4\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u56e0\u5176\u80fd\u8868\u793a\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u52a8\u7269\u5f62\u6001\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u800c\u53d7\u5230\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u6bd4\u8f83\u7814\u7a76\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4fef\u89c6\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u5728\u56db\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684BCS\u9884\u6d4b\uff1a1\uff09\u672a\u5206\u5272\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\uff0c2\uff09\u5206\u5272\u5168\u8eab\u6570\u636e\uff0c3\uff09\u5206\u5272\u540e\u8eaf\u6570\u636e\uff0c4\uff09\u624b\u5de5\u7279\u5f81\u6570\u636e\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4ece\u5546\u4e1a\u519c\u573a\u6536\u96c6\u76841,020\u5934\u5976\u725b\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5976\u725b\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u9732\u3002", "result": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u672a\u5206\u5272\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5206\u5272\u5168\u8eab\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u59cb\u7ec8\u6bd4\u70b9\u4e91\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u5272\u540e\u8eaf\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u53ef\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5f53\u4f7f\u7528\u624b\u5de5\u7279\u5f81\u6570\u636e\u65f6\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u90fd\u964d\u4f4e\u3002\u603b\u4f53\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u70b9\u4e91\u9884\u6d4b\u6bd4\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u66f4\u654f\u611f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e09\u7ef4\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u672a\u5728\u5976\u725b\u4f53\u51b5\u8bc4\u5206\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u800c\u70b9\u4e91\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u66f4\u654f\u611f\u3002"}}

Yu"], "title": "SHED Light on Segmentation for Dense Prediction", "comment": null, "summary": "Dense prediction infers per-pixel values from a single image and is fundamental to 3D perception and robotics. Although real-world scenes exhibit strong structure, existing methods treat it as an independent pixel-wise prediction, often resulting in structural inconsistencies. We propose SHED, a novel encoder-decoder architecture that enforces geometric prior explicitly by incorporating segmentation into dense prediction. By bidirectional hierarchical reasoning, segment tokens are hierarchically pooled in the encoder and unpooled in the decoder to reverse the hierarchy. The model is supervised only at the final output, allowing the segment hierarchy to emerge without explicit segmentation supervision. SHED improves depth boundary sharpness and segment coherence, while demonstrating strong cross-domain generalization from synthetic to the real-world environments. Its hierarchy-aware decoder better captures global 3D scene layouts, leading to improved semantic segmentation performance.

However, existing literature has primarily focused on closed-set tasks, such as visual question answering with predefined options or fixed-category classification. This paper considers selective prediction for visual language foundation models, addressing a taxonomy of tasks ranging from closed to open set and from finite to unbounded vocabularies, as in image captioning. We seek training-free approaches of low-complexity, applicable to any foundation model and consider methods based on external vision-language model embeddings, like CLIP. This is denoted as Plug-and-Play Selective Prediction (PaPSP). We identify two key challenges: (1) instability of the visual-language representations, leading to high variance in image-text embeddings, and (2) poor calibration of similarity scores. To address these issues, we propose a memory augmented PaPSP (MA-PaPSP) model, which augments PaPSP with a retrieval dataset of image-text pairs. This is leveraged to reduce embedding variance by averaging retrieved nearest-neighbor pairs and is complemented by the use of contrastive normalization to improve score calibration. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we show that MA-PaPSP outperforms PaPSP and other selective prediction baselines for selective captioning, image-text matching, and fine-grained classification.

We propose DELNet, a continual learning framework for weather image restoration. DELNet integrates a judging valve that measures task similarity to distinguish new from known tasks, and a dynamic expert library that stores experts trained on different degradations. For new tasks, the valve selects top-k experts for knowledge transfer while adding new experts to capture task-specific features; for known tasks, the corresponding experts are directly reused.

However, existing decoding methods for mitigating video hallucinations, while considering the spatiotemporal characteristics of videos, mostly rely on heuristic designs. As a result, they fail to precisely capture the root causes of hallucinations and their fine-grained temporal and semantic correlations, leading to limited robustness and generalization in complex scenarios. To more effectively mitigate video hallucinations, we propose a novel decoding strategy termed Spatiotemporal-Semantic Contrastive Decoding. This strategy constructs negative features by deliberately disrupting the spatiotemporal consistency and semantic associations of video features, and suppresses video hallucinations through contrastive decoding against the original video features during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only effectively mitigates the occurrence of hallucinations, but also preserves the general video understanding and reasoning capabilities of the model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65f6\u7a7a\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7834\u574f\u89c6\u9891\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u8054\u6784\u5efa\u8d1f\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u7801\u6291\u5236\u89c6\u9891\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u9891\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u95ee\u7b54\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u6216\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u7cbe\u786e\u6355\u6349\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u53ca\u5176\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u65f6\u7a7a\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65f6\u7a7a\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u6545\u610f\u7834\u574f\u89c6\u9891\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u8054\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u8d1f\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u539f\u59cb\u89c6\u9891\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8d1f\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6291\u5236\u89c6\u9891\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u53d1\u751f\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65f6\u7a7a\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u6784\u5efa\u8d1f\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u7f13\u89e3\u89c6\u9891\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In daily phone use, mobile assistants must track streaming audio-visual inputs and respond at the right time, yet existing benchmarks are often restricted to multiple-choice questions or use shorter videos. In this paper, we introduce PhoStream, the first mobile-centric streaming benchmark that unifies on-screen and off-screen scenarios to evaluate video, audio, and temporal reasoning. PhoStream contains 5,572 open-ended QA pairs from 578 videos across 4 scenarios and 10 capabilities. We build it with an Automated Generative Pipeline backed by rigorous human verification, and evaluate models using a realistic Online Inference Pipeline and LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation for open-ended responses. Experiments reveal a temporal asymmetry in LLM-judged scores (0-100): models perform well on Instant and Backward tasks (Gemini 3 Pro exceeds 80), but drop sharply on Forward tasks (16.40), largely due to early responses before the required visual and audio cues appear. This highlights a fundamental limitation: current MLLMs struggle to decide when to speak, not just what to say.

The dataset covers diverse urban, suburban, and rural environments at 0.2m/pixel resolution. We publicly release FOTBCD-Binary, a dataset comprising approximately 28,000 before/after image pairs with pixel-wise binary building change masks, each associated with patch-level spatial metadata.

However, they suffer from catastrophic memory forgetting over long sequences due to balancing historical information with new observations. Recent methods alleviate this by deriving adaptive signals from attention perspective, but they operate on single dimensions without considering temporal and spatial consistency. To this end, we propose a training-free framework termed TTSA3R that leverages both temporal state evolution and spatial observation quality for adaptive state updates in 3D reconstruction. In particular, we devise a Temporal Adaptive Update Module that regulates update magnitude by analyzing temporal state evolution patterns. Then, a Spatial Contextual Update Module is introduced to localize spatial regions that require updates through observation-state alignment and scene dynamics. These complementary signals are finally fused to determine the state updating strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of TTSA3R in diverse 3D tasks. Moreover, our method exhibits only 15% error increase compared to over 200% degradation in baseline models on extended sequences, significantly improving long-term reconstruction stability.

Recent speech large language models (Speech LLMs) have substantially improved SST quality, yet they still struggle to correctly translate rare and domain-specific terminology. While retrieval augmentation has been effective for terminology translation in machine translation, bringing retrieval to SST is non-trivial: it requires fast and accurate cross-modal (speech-to-text) retrieval under partial, continually arriving input, and the model must decide whether and when to apply retrieved terms during incremental generation. We propose Retrieval-Augmented Simultaneous Speech Translation (RASST), which tightly integrates cross-modal retrieval into the SST pipeline. RASST trains a lightweight speech-text retriever and performs efficient sliding-window retrieval, providing chunkwise terminology hints to the Speech LLM. We further synthesize training data that teaches the Speech LLM to leverage retrieved terms precisely.

A Mechanistic Estimation of Computation Density in Transformer-based LLMs", "comment": null, "summary": "Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) are comprised of billions of parameters arranged in deep and wide computational graphs. Several studies on LLM efficiency optimization argue that it is possible to prune a significant portion of the parameters, while only marginally impacting performance. This suggests that the computation is not uniformly distributed across the parameters. We introduce here a technique to systematically quantify computation density in LLMs. In particular, we design a density estimator drawing on mechanistic interpretability. We experimentally test our estimator and find that: (1) contrary to what has been often assumed, LLM processing generally involves dense computation; (2) computation density is dynamic, in the sense that models shift between sparse and dense processing regimes depending on the input; (3) per-input density is significantly correlated across LLMs, suggesting that the same inputs trigger either low or high density. Investigating the factors influencing density, we observe that predicting rarer tokens requires higher density, and increasing context length often decreases the density. We believe that our computation density estimator will contribute to a better understanding of the processing at work in LLMs, challenging their symbolic interpretation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u91cf\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u5904\u7406\u901a\u5e38\u6d89\u53ca\u5bc6\u96c6\u8ba1\u7b97\u800c\u975e\u7a00\u758f\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u5ea6\u662f\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u5185\u5bb9\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u53ef\u4ee5\u5927\u5e45\u526a\u679dLLM\u53c2\u6570\u800c\u4ec5\u8f7b\u5fae\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5e76\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u91cf\u5316LLM\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5904\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8be5\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u6765\u5206\u6790LLM\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09\u4e0e\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u76f8\u53cd\uff0cLLM\u5904\u7406\u901a\u5e38\u6d89\u53ca\u5bc6\u96c6\u8ba1\u7b97\uff1b2\uff09\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u5ea6\u662f\u52a8\u6001\u7684\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6839\u636e\u8f93\u5165\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u95f4\u5207\u6362\uff1b3\uff09\u76f8\u540c\u8f93\u5165\u5728\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u4e2d\u89e6\u53d1\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u7f55\u89c1\u6807\u8bb0\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u901a\u5e38\u964d\u4f4e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3LLM\u7684\u5904\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86LLM\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u89e3\u91ca\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u5185\u5bb9\u3001\u6807\u8bb0\u9891\u7387\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

We study how to design compute-efficient linear attention within this framework. Specifically, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of scaling behavior with respect to parameter counts under different design choices, focusing on (1) normalization paradigms in linear attention (division-based vs. subtraction-based) and (2) depthwise convolution for locality augmentation.\n  Our results show that although subtraction-based normalization is effective for image classification, division-based normalization scales better for linear generative transformers. In addition, incorporating convolution for locality modeling plays a crucial role in autoregressive generation, consistent with findings in diffusion models.\n  We further extend gating mechanisms, commonly used in causal linear attention, to the bidirectional setting and propose a KV gate. By introducing data-independent learnable parameters to the key and value states, the KV gate assigns token-wise memory weights, enabling flexible memory management similar to forget gates in language models.\n  Based on these findings, we present LINA, a simple and compute-efficient T2I model built entirely on linear attention, capable of generating high-fidelity 1024x1024 images from user instructions. LINA achieves competitive performance on both class-conditional and T2I benchmarks, obtaining 2.18 FID on ImageNet (about 1.4B parameters) and 0.74 on GenEval (about 1.5B parameters).

Recent studies have found that LLMs process multilingual inputs in shared concept spaces, thought to support generalization and cross-lingual transfer. However, these prior studies often do not use causal methods, lack deeper error analysis or focus on the final model only, leaving open how these spaces emerge during training. We investigate the development of language-agnostic concept spaces during pretraining of EuroLLM through the causal interpretability method of activation patching. We isolate cross-lingual concept representations, then inject them into a translation prompt to investigate how consistently translations can be altered, independently of the language. We find that shared concept spaces emerge early} and continue to refine, but that alignment with them is language-dependent}. Furthermore, in contrast to prior work, our fine-grained manual analysis reveals that some apparent gains in translation quality reflect shifts in behavior -- like selecting senses for polysemous words or translating instead of copying cross-lingual homographs -- rather than improved translation ability.

This makes linguistically deep annotation difficult and complicates fine-grained analyses aimed at understanding why and how learners produce specific errors. To address these limitations, this paper presents a semi-automated annotation methodology for learner corpora, built upon a recently proposed faceted taxonomy, and implemented through a novel annotation extension framework. The taxonomy provides a theoretically grounded, multi-dimensional categorization that captures the linguistic properties underlying each error instance, thereby enabling standardized, fine-grained, and interpretable enrichment beyond flat annotations. The annotation extension tool, implemented based on the proposed extension framework for Turkish, automatically extends existing flat annotations by inferring additional linguistic and metadata information as facets within the taxonomy to provide richer learner-specific context. It was systematically evaluated and yielded promising performance results, achieving a facet-level accuracy of 95.86%. The resulting taxonomically enriched corpus offers enhanced querying capabilities and supports detailed exploratory analyses across learner corpora, enabling researchers to investigate error patterns through complex linguistic and pedagogical dimensions. This work introduces the first collaboratively annotated and taxonomically enriched Turkish Learner Corpus, a manual annotation guideline with a refined tagset, and an annotation extender.

Existing methods achieve this attribution goal by training models using annotated pairs of synthetic images and their original training sources. However, obtaining such paired supervision is challenging, as it requires either well-designed synthetic concepts or precise annotations from millions of training sources. To eliminate the need for costly paired annotations, in this paper, we explore the possibility of unsupervised synthetic image attribution. We propose a simple yet effective unsupervised method called Alignment and Disentanglement. Specifically, we begin by performing basic concept alignment using contrastive self-supervised learning. Next, we enhance the model's attribution ability by promoting representation disentanglement with the Infomax loss. This approach is motivated by an interesting observation: contrastive self-supervised models, such as MoCo and DINO, inherently exhibit the ability to perform simple cross-domain alignment.

To further stabilize alignment learning, we develop an energy-based multi-scale consistency regularization scheme, including a Top-K multi-positive contrastive objective and a Geometry-Aware Consistency Objective derived from a Lagrangian-constrained free-energy minimization. Extensive experiments show that ExpAlign consistently improves open-vocabulary detection and zero-shot instance segmentation, particularly on long-tail categories.

Yet multi-dialectal performance remains underexplored. We introduce $\\textbf{MDial}$, the first large-scale framework for generating multi-dialectal conversational data encompassing the three pillars of written dialect -- lexical (vocabulary), orthographic (spelling), and morphosyntactic (grammar) features -- for nine English dialects. Partnering with native linguists, we design an annotated and scalable rule-based LLM transformation to ensure precision. Our approach challenges the assumption that models should mirror users' morphosyntactic features, showing that up to 90% of the grammatical features of a dialect should not be reproduced by models. Independent evaluations confirm data quality, with annotators preferring MDial outputs over prior methods in 98% of pairwise comparisons for dialect naturalness. Using this pipeline, we construct the dialect-parallel $\\textbf{MDialBench}$mark with 50k+ dialogs, resulting in 97k+ QA pairs, and evaluate 17 LLMs on dialect identification and response generation tasks. Even frontier models achieve under 70% accuracy, fail to reach 50% for Canadian English, and systematically misclassify non-SAE dialects as American or British.

In this paper, we propose VisionTrim, a unified framework for training-free MLLM acceleration, integrating two effective plug-and-play modules: 1) the Dominant Vision Token Selection (DVTS) module, which preserves essential visual tokens via a global-local view, and 2) the Text-Guided Vision Complement (TGVC) module, which facilitates context-aware token merging guided by textual cues. Extensive experiments across diverse image and video multimodal benchmarks demonstrate the performance superiority of our VisionTrim, advancing practical MLLM deployment in real-world applications.

Yet, despite this temporal capacity, most progress concentrates on static image benchmarks, and SNNs still underperform on dynamic video tasks compared to artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this work, we diagnose a fundamental pass-band mismatch: Standard spiking dynamics behave as a temporal low pass that emphasizes static content while attenuating motion bearing bands, where task relevant information concentrates in dynamic tasks. This phenomenon explains why SNNs can approach ANNs on static tasks yet fall behind on tasks that demand richer temporal understanding.To remedy this, we propose the Pass-Bands Optimizer (PBO), a plug-and-play module that optimizes the temporal pass-band toward task-relevant motion bands. PBO introduces only two learnable parameters, and a lightweight consistency constraint that preserves semantics and boundaries, incurring negligible computational overhead and requires no architectural changes. PBO deliberately suppresses static components that contribute little to discrimination, effectively high passing the stream so that spiking activity concentrates on motion bearing content. On UCF101, PBO yields over ten percentage points improvement. On more complex multi-modal action recognition and weakly supervised video anomaly detection, PBO delivers consistent and significant gains, offering a new perspective for SNN based video processing and understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPBO\uff08Pass-Bands Optimizer\uff09\u6a21\u5757\u89e3\u51b3SNN\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u901a\u5e26\u4f7f\u8109\u51b2\u6d3b\u52a8\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u76f8\u5173\u9891\u6bb5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1SNN\u5177\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4ecd\u843d\u540e\u4e8eANN\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6807\u51c6\u8109\u51b2\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u4f4e\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9759\u6001\u5185\u5bb9\u800c\u8870\u51cf\u8fd0\u52a8\u76f8\u5173\u9891\u6bb5\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u9700\u8981\u4e30\u5bcc\u65f6\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPBO\uff08Pass-Bands Optimizer\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ec5\u4e24\u4e2a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u901a\u5e26\u4f18\u5316\u5230\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u9891\u6bb5\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u5bf9\u533a\u5206\u8d21\u732e\u5c0f\u7684\u9759\u6001\u6210\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5728UCF101\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u8d85\u8fc710\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u5728\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cPBO\u90fd\u5e26\u6765\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "PBO\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316SNN\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u901a\u5e26\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86SNN\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8eSNN\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5904\u7406\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

However, despite their ubiquitous use, the exact mechanisms underlying their outstanding performance remain unclear. Different methods for LLM explainability exist, and many are, as a method, not fully understood themselves. We started with the question of how linguistic abstraction emerges in LLMs, aiming to detect it across different LLM modules (attention heads and input embeddings). For this, we used methods well-established in the literature: (1) probing for token-level relational structures, and (2) feature-mapping using embeddings as carriers of human-interpretable properties.\n  Both attempts failed for different methodological reasons: Attention-based explanations collapsed once we tested the core assumption that later-layer representations still correspond to tokens. Property-inference methods applied to embeddings also failed because their high predictive scores were driven by methodological artifacts and dataset structure rather than meaningful semantic knowledge. These failures matter because both techniques are widely treated as evidence for what LLMs supposedly understand, yet our results show such conclusions are unwarranted.

However, previous methods are prone to overfitting the IV classes, leading to the OOV or undefined classes being misclassified as IV ones with a high confidence score. To address this issue, this paper proposes a zero-shot OOV detector (OOVDet), a novel framework that effectively detects predefined classes while reliably rejecting undefined ones in zero-shot scenes. Specifically, due to the model's lack of prior knowledge about the distribution of OOV data, we synthesize region-level OOV prompts by sampling from the low-likelihood regions of the class-conditional Gaussian distributions in the hidden space, motivated by the assumption that unknown semantics are more likely to emerge in low-density areas of the latent space. For OOV images, we further propose a Dirichlet-based gradient attribution mechanism to mine pseudo-OOV image samples, where the attribution gradients are interpreted as Dirichlet evidence to estimate prediction uncertainty, and samples with high uncertainty are selected as pseudo-OOV images. Building on these synthesized OOV prompts and pseudo-OOV images, we construct the OOV decision boundary through a low-density prior constraint, which regularizes the optimization of OOV classes using Gaussian kernel density estimation in accordance with the above assumption.\n  Experimental results show that our method significantly improves the OOV detection performance in zero-shot scenes.

Although they achieve competitive performance on several tasks, a substantial gap remains in open-ended text generation. We hypothesize that one cause of this gap is that strict positional prediction makes MDLM decoding highly sensitive to token misalignment, and we show through controlled interventions that a one-position shift can severely disrupt semantics. This observation suggests that enforcing strict positional supervision during training is misaligned with the irreversible denoising dynamics of MDLM decoding. Motivated by this mismatch, we adopt an alignment-flexible supervision strategy during fine-tuning. Specifically, we introduce a special token <slack> via the connectionist temporal classification objective. We apply this approach to the widely used MDLM model and conduct experiments on five open-ended text generation benchmarks.

However, existing LLM-enhanced GNN approaches are constrained by predefined prompting and decoupled training pipelines, limiting reasoning autonomy and weakening semantic-structural alignment. We propose FraudCoT, a unified framework that advances TAG-based fraud detection through autonomous, graph-aware chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and scalable LLM-GNN co-training. To address the limitations of predefined prompts, we introduce a fraud-aware selective CoT distillation mechanism that generates diverse reasoning paths and enhances semantic-structural understanding.

However, existing VLMs remain notably weak at understanding negated clinical statements, largely due to contrastive alignment objectives that treat negation as a minor linguistic variation rather than a meaning-inverting operator. In multi-label settings, prompt-based InfoNCE fine-tuning further reinforces easy-positive image-prompt alignments, limiting effective learning of disease absence. To overcome these limitations, we reformulate vision-language alignment as a conditional semantic comparison problem, which is instantiated through a bi-directional multiple-choice learning framework(Bi-MCQ). By jointly training Image-to-Text and Text-to-Image MCQ tasks with affirmative, negative, and mixed prompts, our method implements fine-tuning as conditional semantic comparison instead of global similarity maximization. We further introduce direction-specific Cross-Attention fusion modules to address asymmetric cues required by bi-directional reasoning and reduce alignment interference. Experiments on ChestXray14, Open-I, CheXpert, and PadChest show that Bi-MCQ improves negation understanding by up to 0.47 AUC over the zero-shot performance of the state-of-the-art CARZero model, while achieving up to a 0.08 absolute gain on positive-negative combined (PNC) evaluation. Additionally, Bi-MCQ reduces the affirmative-negative AUC gap by an average of 0.12 compared to InfoNCE-based fine-tuning, demonstrating that objective reformulation can substantially enhance negation understanding in medical VLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faBi-MCQ\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5426\u5b9a\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u8bed\u4e49\u6bd4\u8f83\u800c\u975e\u5168\u5c40\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u6700\u5927\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u5426\u5b9a\u4e34\u5e8a\u9648\u8ff0\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5f31\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5bf9\u9f50\u76ee\u6807\u5c06\u5426\u5b9a\u89c6\u4e3a\u5fae\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u53d8\u5316\u800c\u975e\u610f\u4e49\u53cd\u8f6c\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u5728\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684InfoNCE\u5fae\u8c03\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5f3a\u5316\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u6b63\u6837\u672c\u7684\u56fe\u50cf-\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u75be\u75c5\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u5411\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6(Bi-MCQ)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u6587\u672c\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u80af\u5b9a\u3001\u5426\u5b9a\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5c06\u5fae\u8c03\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u8bed\u4e49\u6bd4\u8f83\u800c\u975e\u5168\u5c40\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u6700\u5927\u5316\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u65b9\u5411\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u5904\u7406\u53cc\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u6240\u9700\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u7ebf\u7d22\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "result": "\u5728ChestXray14\u3001Open-I\u3001CheXpert\u548cPadChest\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cBi-MCQ\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684CARZero\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c06\u5426\u5b9a\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe0.47 AUC\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u6b63\u8d1f\u7ec4\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u8fbe0.08\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u589e\u76ca\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8eInfoNCE\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\uff0cBi-MCQ\u5c06\u80af\u5b9a-\u5426\u5b9aAUC\u5dee\u8ddd\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c11\u4e860.12\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5426\u5b9a\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0cBi-MCQ\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6761\u4ef6\u8bed\u4e49\u6bd4\u8f83\u800c\u975e\u5168\u5c40\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u5426\u5b9a\u9648\u8ff0\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

However, state-of-the-art block-wise dLLMs rely on a \"remasking\" mechanism that decodes only the most confident tokens and discards the rest, effectively wasting computation. We demonstrate that recycling computation from the discarded tokens is beneficial, as these tokens retain contextual information useful for subsequent decoding iterations. In light of this, we propose Residual Context Diffusion (RCD), a module that converts these discarded token representations into contextual residuals and injects them back for the next denoising step. RCD uses a decoupled two-stage training pipeline to bypass the memory bottlenecks associated with backpropagation. We validate our method on both long CoT reasoning (SDAR) and short CoT instruction following (LLaDA) models. We demonstrate that a standard dLLM can be efficiently converted to the RCD paradigm with merely ~1 billion tokens. RCD consistently improves frontier dLLMs by 5-10 points in accuracy with minimal extra computation overhead across a wide range of benchmarks. Notably, on the most challenging AIME tasks, RCD nearly doubles baseline accuracy and attains up to 4-5x fewer denoising steps at equivalent accuracy levels.", "AI": {"tldr": "RCD\uff08\u6b8b\u5dee\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6269\u6563\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u56de\u6536\u88ab\u4e22\u5f03\u7684token\u8ba1\u7b97\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6269\u6563\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5757\u72b6\u6269\u6563\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\"\u91cd\u63a9\u7801\"\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53ea\u89e3\u7801\u6700\u81ea\u4fe1\u7684token\u800c\u4e22\u5f03\u5176\u4f59token\uff0c\u8fd9\u6d6a\u8d39\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u3002\u88ab\u4e22\u5f03\u7684token\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u6709\u7528\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u4e8e\u540e\u7eed\u89e3\u7801", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6b8b\u5dee\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6269\u6563\uff08RCD\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5c06\u88ab\u4e22\u5f03\u7684token\u8868\u793a\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6b8b\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u6ce8\u5165\u5230\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u6765\u907f\u514d\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888", "result": "RCD\u5c06\u6807\u51c6dLLM\u9ad8\u6548\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3aRCD\u8303\u5f0f\u4ec5\u9700\u7ea610\u4ebftoken\u3002\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cRCD\u5c06\u524d\u6cbfdLLM\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53475-10\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u6700\u5c0f\u3002\u5728\u6700\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684AIME\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cRCD\u51e0\u4e4e\u5c06\u57fa\u7ebf\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7ffb\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u540c\u7b49\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u51cf\u5c114-5\u500d\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4", "conclusion": "RCD\u901a\u8fc7\u56de\u6536\u88ab\u4e22\u5f03token\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

However, most post-hoc detection methods operate on penultimate feature representations derived from global average pooling (GAP) -- a lossy operation that discards valuable distributional statistics from activation maps prior to global average pooling. We contend that these overlooked statistics, particularly channel-wise variance and dominant (maximum) activations, are highly discriminative for OOD detection. We introduce DAVIS, a simple and broadly applicable post-hoc technique that enriches feature vectors by incorporating these crucial statistics, directly addressing the information loss from GAP.

We hypothesize that these outliers, in conjunction with the corresponding normalizations (\\textit{e.g.}, softmax attention and RMSNorm), effectively rescale other non-outlier components. We term this phenomenon \\textit{outlier-driven rescaling} and validate this hypothesis across different model architectures and training token counts. This view unifies the origin and mitigation of both sink types. Our main conclusions and observations include: (1) Outliers function jointly with normalization: removing normalization eliminates the corresponding outliers but degrades training stability and performance; directly clipping outliers while retaining normalization leads to degradation, indicating that outlier-driven rescaling contributes to training stability. (2) Outliers serve more as rescale factors rather than contributors, as the final contributions of attention and residual sinks are significantly smaller than those of non-outliers. (3) Outliers can be absorbed into learnable parameters or mitigated via explicit gated rescaling, leading to improved training performance (average gain of 2 points) and enhanced quantization robustness (1.2 points degradation under W4A4 quantization).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\uff08\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6c47\u805a\u70b9\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u6c47\u805a\u70b9\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u64cd\u4f5c\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u975e\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u5206\u91cf\u7684\u91cd\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u673a\u5236\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\uff08\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6c47\u805a\u70b9\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u6c47\u805a\u70b9\uff09\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5b83\u4eec\u5982\u4f55\u4e0e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u64cd\u4f5c\u534f\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\"\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u9a71\u52a8\u91cd\u7f29\u653e\"\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3token\u6570\u91cf\u4e0b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u5047\u8bbe\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u79fb\u9664\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u3001\u76f4\u63a5\u88c1\u526a\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u3001\u5c06\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u5438\u6536\u5230\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u4e2d\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f7f\u7528\u663e\u5f0f\u95e8\u63a7\u91cd\u7f29\u653e\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "1) \u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u4e0e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\uff1a\u79fb\u9664\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u4f1a\u6d88\u9664\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u4f46\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u4fdd\u7559\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u76f4\u63a5\u88c1\u526a\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u4e5f\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u30022) \u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u4e3b\u8981\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cd\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\u800c\u975e\u8d21\u732e\u8005\uff1a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6c47\u805a\u70b9\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u6c47\u805a\u70b9\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u8d21\u732e\u663e\u8457\u5c0f\u4e8e\u975e\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u30023) \u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u5438\u6536\u5230\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u4e2d\u6216\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u95e8\u63a7\u91cd\u7f29\u653e\u7f13\u89e3\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u5e73\u57472\u4e2a\u70b9\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u5728W4A4\u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\u4ec5\u4ea7\u751f1.2\u4e2a\u70b9\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\uff08\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6c47\u805a\u70b9\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u6c47\u805a\u70b9\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u64cd\u4f5c\u534f\u540c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\"\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u9a71\u52a8\u91cd\u7f29\u653e\"\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u4ee5\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u91ca\u4e24\u7c7b\u6c47\u805a\u70b9\u7684\u8d77\u6e90\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u5438\u6536\u5230\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u6216\u4f7f\u7528\u663e\u5f0f\u95e8\u63a7\u91cd\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u91cf\u5316\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Despite its potential, quantization-aware training for VLMs remains underexplored. We propose GRACE, a framework unifying knowledge distillation and QAT under the Information Bottleneck principle: quantization constrains information capacity while distillation guides what to preserve within this budget. Treating the teacher as a proxy for task-relevant information, we introduce confidence-gated decoupled distillation to filter unreliable supervision, relational centered kernel alignment to transfer visual token structures, and an adaptive controller via Lagrangian relaxation to balance fidelity against capacity constraints. Across extensive benchmarks on LLaVA and Qwen families, our INT4 models consistently outperform FP16 baselines (e.g., LLaVA-1.5-7B: 70.1 vs. 66.8 on SQA; Qwen2-VL-2B: 76.9 vs. 72.6 on MMBench), nearly matching teacher performance.

Traditional metrics struggle to quantify fine-grained texture details and semantic consistency, while existing datasets fail to meet commercial standards in scale and diversity. We present OpenVTON-Bench, a large-scale benchmark comprising approximately 100K high-resolution image pairs (up to $1536 \\times 1536$). The dataset is constructed using DINOv3-based hierarchical clustering for semantically balanced sampling and Gemini-powered dense captioning, ensuring a uniform distribution across 20 fine-grained garment categories. To support reliable evaluation, we propose a multi-modal protocol that measures VTON quality along five interpretable dimensions: background consistency, identity fidelity, texture fidelity, shape plausibility, and overall realism. The protocol integrates VLM-based semantic reasoning with a novel Multi-Scale Representation Metric based on SAM3 segmentation and morphological erosion, enabling the separation of boundary alignment errors from internal texture artifacts. Experimental results show strong agreement with human judgments (Kendall's $\u03c4$ of 0.833 vs. 0.611 for SSIM), establishing a robust benchmark for VTON evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "OpenVTON-Bench\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u865a\u62df\u8bd5\u7a7f\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u7ea610\u4e07\u5f20\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u4ece\u4e94\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8861\u91cfVTON\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u865a\u62df\u8bd5\u7a7f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u96be\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7eb9\u7406\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5728\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0a\u8fbe\u4e0d\u5230\u5546\u4e1a\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u7ea610\u4e07\u5f20\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528DINOv3\u5206\u5c42\u805a\u7c7b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u5e73\u8861\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Gemini\u5bc6\u96c6\u6807\u6ce8\u786e\u4fdd20\u4e2a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u670d\u88c5\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u4ece\u80cc\u666f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u5f62\u72b6\u5408\u7406\u6027\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u4e94\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8861\u91cfVTON\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408VLM\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eSAM3\u5206\u5272\u4e0e\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u4fb5\u8680\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8868\u793a\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff08Kendall's \u03c4\u4e3a0.833\uff0c\u800cSSIM\u4ec5\u4e3a0.611\uff09\uff0c\u4e3aVTON\u8bc4\u4f30\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "OpenVTON-Bench\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u865a\u62df\u8bd5\u7a7f\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3aVTON\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Despite growing attention to political bias in LLMs, prior work largely focuses on high-resource, Western languages or narrow multilingual settings, leaving cross-lingual consistency and safe post-hoc mitigation underexplored. To address this gap, we present a large-scale multilingual evaluation of political bias spanning 50 countries and 33 languages. We introduce a complementary post-hoc mitigation framework, Cross-Lingual Alignment Steering (CLAS), designed to augment existing steering methods by aligning ideological representations across languages and dynamically regulating intervention strength. This method aligns latent ideological representations induced by political prompts into a shared ideological subspace, ensuring cross lingual consistency, with the adaptive mechanism prevents over correction and preserves coherence. Experiments demonstrate substantial bias reduction along both economic and social axes with minimal degradation in response quality. The proposed framework establishes a scalable and interpretable paradigm for fairness-aware multilingual LLM governance, balancing ideological neutrality with linguistic and cultural diversity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u653f\u6cbb\u504f\u89c1\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u5f15\u5bfc\uff08CLAS\uff09\u540e\u5904\u7406\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u51cf\u5c11LLMs\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u653f\u6cbb\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u65e5\u76ca\u5f71\u54cd\u5168\u7403\u8bdd\u8bed\uff0c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u4e2d\u7acb\u6027\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684AI\u90e8\u7f72\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u897f\u65b9\u8bed\u8a00\u6216\u72ed\u7a84\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u540e\u671f\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u5f15\u5bfc\uff08CLAS\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u653f\u6cbb\u63d0\u793a\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u5230\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u73b0\u6709\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u9632\u6b62\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6821\u6b63\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u4e24\u4e2a\u8f74\u5411\u4e0a\u90fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u6700\u5c0f\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u572850\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u548c33\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u516c\u5e73\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00LLM\u6cbb\u7406\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u4e2d\u7acb\u6027\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u6587\u5316\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing data selection methods suffer from severe domain specificity: techniques optimized for general instruction-following fail on reasoning tasks, and vice versa. We observe that measuring entropy differences between base models and minimally instruction-tuned calibrated models reveals a pattern -- samples with the lowest differential entropy consistently yield optimal performance across domains, yet this principle manifests domain-adaptively: reasoning tasks favor entropy increase (cognitive expansion), while general tasks favor entropy decrease (cognitive compression). We introduce InstructDiff, a unified framework that operationalizes differential entropy as a domain-adaptive selection criterion through warmup calibration, bi-directional NLL filtering, and entropy-based ranking. Extensive experiments show that InstructDiff achieves 17\\% relative improvement over full data training on mathematical reasoning and 52\\% for general instruction-following, outperforming prior baselines while using only 10\\% of the data.", "AI": {"tldr": "InstructDiff\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u5dee\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6821\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u71b5\u53d8\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b017%\u548c52%\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u752810%\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03(SFT)\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u4e14\u6536\u76ca\u9012\u51cf\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u2014\u2014\u9488\u5bf9\u901a\u7528\u6307\u4ee4\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u53cd\u4e4b\u4ea6\u7136\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faInstructDiff\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u71b5\u5dee\uff1b2) \u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u71b5\u53d8\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0d\u540c\u2014\u2014\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u504f\u597d\u71b5\u589e\u52a0\uff08\u8ba4\u77e5\u6269\u5c55\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u504f\u597d\u71b5\u51cf\u5c11\uff08\u8ba4\u77e5\u538b\u7f29\uff09\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u70ed\u6821\u51c6\u3001\u53cc\u5411NLL\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd4\u5168\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u83b7\u5f9717%\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728\u901a\u7528\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f9752%\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u4f7f\u752810%\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6821\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u71b5\u5dee\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002InstructDiff\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3SFT\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Recent studies employ autoencoders to achieve this by reconstructing textual CoT from latent tokens, thus encoding CoT semantics. However, treating textual CoT as the reconstruction target forces latent tokens to preserve surface-level linguistic features (e.g., word choice and syntax), introducing a strong linguistic inductive bias that prioritizes linguistic form over reasoning structure and limits logical abstraction. Thus, we propose ImgCoT that replaces the reconstruction target from textual CoT to the visual CoT obtained by rendering CoT into images. This substitutes linguistic bias with spatial inductive bias, i.e., a tendency to model spatial layouts of the reasoning steps in visual CoT, enabling latent tokens to better capture global reasoning structure. Moreover, although visual latent tokens encode abstract reasoning structure, they may blur reasoning details. We thus propose a loose ImgCoT, a hybrid reasoning that augments visual latent tokens with a few key textual reasoning steps, selected based on low token log-likelihood. This design allows LLMs to retain both global reasoning structure and fine-grained reasoning details with fewer tokens than the complete CoT.

However, existing ABSA research relies on coarse-grained categorical labels (e.g., positive, negative), which limits its ability to capture nuanced affective states. To address this limitation, we adopt a dimensional approach that represents sentiment with continuous valence-arousal (VA) scores, enabling fine-grained analysis at both the aspect and sentiment levels. To this end, we introduce DimABSA, the first multilingual, dimensional ABSA resource annotated with both traditional ABSA elements (aspect terms, aspect categories, and opinion terms) and newly introduced VA scores. This resource contains 76,958 aspect instances across 42,590 sentences, spanning six languages and four domains. We further introduce three subtasks that combine VA scores with different ABSA elements, providing a bridge from traditional ABSA to dimensional ABSA. Given that these subtasks involve both categorical and continuous outputs, we propose a new unified metric, continuous F1 (cF1), which incorporates VA prediction error into standard F1. We provide a comprehensive benchmark using both prompted and fine-tuned large language models across all subtasks.

Existing benchmarks are typically multilingual but text-only, or multimodal but monolingual. Recent multilingual multimodal red-teaming efforts render harmful prompts into images, yet rely heavily on typography-style visuals and lack semantically grounded image-text pairs, limiting coverage of realistic cross-modal interactions. We introduce Lingua-SafetyBench, a benchmark of 100,440 harmful image-text pairs across 10 languages, explicitly partitioned into image-dominant and text-dominant subsets to disentangle risk sources. Evaluating 11 open-source VLLMs reveals a consistent asymmetry: image-dominant risks yield higher ASR in high-resource languages, while text-dominant risks are more severe in non-high-resource languages. A controlled study on the Qwen series shows that scaling and version upgrades reduce Attack Success Rate (ASR) overall but disproportionately benefit HRLs, widening the gap between HRLs and Non-HRLs under text-dominant risks. This underscores the necessity of language- and modality-aware safety alignment beyond mere scaling.To facilitate reproducibility and future research, we will publicly release our benchmark, model checkpoints, and source code.The code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/zsxr15/Lingua-SafetyBench.Warning: this paper contains examples with unsafe content.", "AI": {"tldr": "Lingua-SafetyBench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b100,440\u4e2a\u6709\u5bb3\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d610\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u533a\u5206\u56fe\u50cf\u4e3b\u5bfc\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4e3b\u5bfc\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30VLLMs\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u8981\u4e48\u662f\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u4f46\u4ec5\u9650\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u662f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f46\u5355\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8054\u5408\u8f93\u5165\u4e0bVLLMs\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6392\u7248\u5f0f\u89c6\u89c9\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bed\u4e49\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaLingua-SafetyBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b100,440\u4e2a\u6709\u5bb3\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\uff0c\u6db5\u76d610\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u4e3b\u5bfc\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5b50\u96c6\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u98ce\u9669\u6765\u6e90\u3002\u8bc4\u4f3011\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90VLLMs\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Qwen\u7cfb\u5217\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u63a7\u5236\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff1a\u56fe\u50cf\u4e3b\u5bfc\u98ce\u9669\u5728\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u6587\u672c\u4e3b\u5bfc\u98ce\u9669\u5728\u975e\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u66f4\u4e25\u91cd\u3002Qwen\u7cfb\u5217\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u7248\u672c\u5347\u7ea7\u603b\u4f53\u4e0a\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86ASR\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u53d7\u76ca\u66f4\u5927\uff0c\u5728\u6587\u672c\u4e3b\u5bfc\u98ce\u9669\u4e0b\u6269\u5927\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u975e\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ec5\u9760\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u8d85\u8d8a\u5355\u7eaf\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Prior explanations mainly attribute this phenomenon to the generalization of erroneous or unsafe content. In this work, we show that this view is incomplete. Across multiple domains and model families, we find that fine-tuning models on data exhibiting specific character-level dispositions induces substantially stronger and more transferable misalignment than incorrect-advice fine-tuning, while largely preserving general capabilities. This indicates that emergent misalignment arises from stable shifts in model behavior rather than from capability degradation or corrupted knowledge. We further show that such behavioral dispositions can be conditionally activated by both training-time triggers and inference-time persona-aligned prompts, revealing shared structure across emergent misalignment, backdoor activation, and jailbreak susceptibility. Overall, our results identify character formation as a central and underexplored alignment risk, suggesting that robust alignment must address behavioral dispositions rather than isolated errors or prompt-level defenses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5fae\u8c03LLM\u65f6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u5b57\u7b26\u7ea7\u884c\u4e3a\u503e\u5411\u4e0a\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u6bd4\u9519\u8bef\u5efa\u8bae\u5fae\u8c03\u66f4\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u5bf9\u9f50\u98ce\u9669\u6e90\u4e8e\u884c\u4e3a\u503e\u5411\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u8f6c\u53d8\u800c\u975e\u80fd\u529b\u9000\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5c06\"\u6d8c\u73b0\u6027\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\"\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u9519\u8bef\u6216\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u672c\u6587\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u79cd\u89c2\u70b9\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u5fae\u8c03\u5982\u4f55\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u51fa\u73b0\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u5217\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u7279\u5b9a\u5b57\u7b26\u7ea7\u884c\u4e3a\u503e\u5411\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0e\u9519\u8bef\u5efa\u8bae\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u89d2\u8272\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u793a\u5982\u4f55\u6761\u4ef6\u6027\u6fc0\u6d3b\u884c\u4e3a\u503e\u5411\u3002", "result": "\u7279\u5b9a\u5b57\u7b26\u7ea7\u884c\u4e3a\u503e\u5411\u5fae\u8c03\u6bd4\u9519\u8bef\u5efa\u8bae\u5fae\u8c03\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u5f3a\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u57fa\u672c\u4fdd\u7559\u4e00\u822c\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u884c\u4e3a\u503e\u5411\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6761\u4ef6\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5bf9\u9f50\u5931\u6548\u3001\u540e\u95e8\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u8d8a\u72f1\u6613\u611f\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5171\u540c\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89d2\u8272\u5f62\u6210\u662f\u5bf9\u9f50\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u4e14\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u5fc5\u987b\u89e3\u51b3\u884c\u4e3a\u503e\u5411\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u5b64\u7acb\u9519\u8bef\u6216\u63d0\u793a\u7ea7\u9632\u5fa1\u3002"}}

We propose StreamSense, a streaming detector that couples a lightweight streaming encoder with selective routing to a Vision-Language Model (VLM) expert. StreamSense handles most timestamps with the lightweight streaming encoder, escalates hard/ambiguous cases to the VLM, and defers decisions when context is insufficient. The encoder is trained using (i) a cross-modal contrastive term to align visual/audio cues with textual signals, and (ii) an IoU-weighted loss that down-weights poorly overlapping target segments, mitigating label interference across segment boundaries. We evaluate StreamSense on multiple social streaming detection tasks (e.g., sentiment classification and hate content moderation), and the results show that StreamSense achieves higher accuracy than VLM-only streaming while only occasionally invoking the VLM, thereby reducing average latency and compute. Our results indicate that selective escalation and deferral are effective primitives for understanding streaming social tasks.

Developing safeguards for LLMs inspired by this mechanism might be particularly helpful for their application in high-stakes tasks such as automating compliance with data privacy laws. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Epistemic Fallback (DEF), a dynamic safety protocol for improving an LLM's inference-time defenses against deceptive attacks that make use of maliciously perturbed policy texts. Through various levels of one-sentence textual cues, DEF nudges LLMs to flag inconsistencies, refuse compliance, and fallback to their parametric knowledge upon encountering perturbed policy texts. Using globally recognized legal policies such as HIPAA and GDPR, our empirical evaluations report that DEF effectively improves the capability of frontier LLMs to detect and refuse perturbed versions of policies, with DeepSeek-R1 achieving a 100% detection rate in one setting. This work encourages further efforts to develop cognitively inspired defenses to improve LLM robustness against forms of harm and deception that exploit legal artifacts.", "AI": {"tldr": "DEF\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5b89\u5168\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u5bf9\u6076\u610f\u7be1\u6539\u653f\u7b56\u6587\u672c\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u62d2\u7edd\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728HIPAA\u548cGDPR\u7b49\u6cd5\u5f8b\u653f\u7b56\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u9632\u5fa1\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\uff08\u8ba4\u77e5\u8b66\u60d5\u6027\uff09\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u5f00\u53d1\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u9075\u5b88\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u5f8b\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u6076\u610f\u7be1\u6539\u653f\u7b56\u6587\u672c\u7684\u6b3a\u9a97\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u8ba4\u77e5\u56de\u9000\uff08DEF\uff09\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u7ea7\u7684\u5355\u53e5\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4fc3\u4f7fLLM\u5728\u9047\u5230\u7be1\u6539\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u6587\u672c\u65f6\u80fd\u591f\u6807\u8bb0\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u62d2\u7edd\u9075\u5b88\uff0c\u5e76\u56de\u9000\u5230\u5176\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528HIPAA\u548cGDPR\u7b49\u5168\u7403\u8ba4\u53ef\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u653f\u7b56\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cDEF\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u524d\u6cbfLLM\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u62d2\u7edd\u7be1\u6539\u653f\u7b56\u7248\u672c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dDeepSeek-R1\u5728\u67d0\u4e2a\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86100%\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u9f13\u52b1\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5f00\u53d1\u53d7\u8ba4\u77e5\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8LLM\u5bf9\u6297\u5229\u7528\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6587\u4e66\u7684\u4f24\u5bb3\u548c\u6b3a\u9a97\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

This has spurred the development of proactive defense methods. However, existing approaches face a core trade-off: large perturbations distort facial structures, while small ones weaken protection effectiveness. To address these issues, we propose FaceDefense, an enhanced proactive defense framework against diffusion-based face swapping. Our method introduces a new diffusion loss to strengthen the defensive efficacy of adversarial examples, and employs a directional facial attribute editing to restore perturbation-induced distortions, thereby enhancing visual imperceptibility. A two-phase alternating optimization strategy is designed to generate final perturbed face images.

Existing iterative refinement methods in statement autoformalization typicall improve isolated aspects of formalization, such as syntactic correctness, but struggle to jointly optimizing multiple quality dimensions, which is critical for full-theorem autoformalization. We introduce a reference-free iterative monotonic process for full-theorem autoformalization that leverages complementary feedback from theorem provers and LLM-based judges, without access to ground-truth proofs or existing formalizations at inference time. Our approach optimizes a masked composite objective over Formal Validity, Logical Preservation, Mathematical Consistency, and Formal Quality, guided by a responsiveness map that indicates how different LLMs acting as different roles preferentially improve each dimension. We further propose an acceptance policy that guarantees certified monotonic improvement, and provide conditions ensuring convergence and termination. Empirical experiments demonstrate the proposed process enables simultaneous improvement across multiple dimensions, achieving 93.44% formal validity and a 78.22% overall score on miniF2F, and 44.09% formal validity and a 29.79% overall score on ProofNet.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u5355\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5168\u5b9a\u7406\u81ea\u52a8\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u5668\u548cLLM\u6cd5\u5b98\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u65e0\u9700\u771f\u5b9e\u8bc1\u660e\u6216\u73b0\u6709\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5f62\u5f0f\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u903b\u8f91\u4fdd\u6301\u3001\u6570\u5b66\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5f62\u5f0f\u8d28\u91cf\u56db\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u9648\u8ff0\u81ea\u52a8\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u53d1\u5c55\u8fc5\u901f\uff0c\u4f46\u5168\u5b9a\u7406\u81ea\u52a8\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4ecd\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u6539\u8fdb\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7684\u5b64\u7acb\u65b9\u9762\uff08\u5982\u8bed\u6cd5\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u4e2a\u8d28\u91cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5168\u5b9a\u7406\u81ea\u52a8\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u5355\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u5668\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u6cd5\u5b98\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5f62\u5f0f\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u903b\u8f91\u4fdd\u6301\u3001\u6570\u5b66\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5f62\u5f0f\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u590d\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u6620\u5c04\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u89d2\u8272\u4f18\u5148\u6539\u8fdb\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8ba4\u8bc1\u5355\u8c03\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u63a5\u53d7\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u786e\u4fdd\u6536\u655b\u548c\u7ec8\u6b62\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u540c\u65f6\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5728miniF2F\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523093.44%\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c78.22%\u7684\u603b\u4f53\u5f97\u5206\uff0c\u5728ProofNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523044.09%\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c29.79%\u7684\u603b\u4f53\u5f97\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u8fed\u4ee3\u5355\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5168\u5b9a\u7406\u81ea\u52a8\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e2d\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u5668\u548cLLM\u6cd5\u5b98\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u771f\u5b9e\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5355\u8c03\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

We first show these approaches have an inherent fidelity-stability dilemma in how they detect anomalies via reconstruction residuals. We then abandon the reconstruction paradigm entirely and propose Retrieval-based Anomaly Detection (RAD). RAD is a training-free approach that stores anomaly-free features in a memory and detects anomalies through multi-level retrieval, matching test patches against the memory. Experiments demonstrate that RAD achieves state-of-the-art performance across four established benchmarks (MVTec-AD, VisA, Real-IAD, 3D-ADAM) under both standard and few-shot settings. On MVTec-AD, RAD reaches 96.7\\% Pixel AUROC with just a single anomaly-free image compared to 98.5\\% of RAD's full-data performance. We further prove that retrieval-based scores theoretically upper-bound reconstruction-residual scores. Collectively, these findings overturn the assumption that MUAD requires task-specific training, showing that state-of-the-art anomaly detection is feasible with memory-based retrieval.

Concretely, we investigate color correlations induced by the color filter array (CFA) and demosaicing, and propose a Demosaicing-guided Color Correlation Training (DCCT) framework for AI-generated image detection. By simulating the CFA sampling pattern, we decompose each color image into a single-channel input (as the condition) and the remaining two channels as the ground-truth targets (for prediction).

The dataset comprises 581 QA pairs across 105 synthetic r\u00e9sum\u00e9-job description pairs in five languages (English, Spanish, Italian, German, and Chinese), with questions spanning three complexity levels from basic factual extraction to complex cross-document reasoning. We propose a data generation pipeline derived from real-world sources through de-identification and data synthesis to ensure both realism and privacy, while controlled demographic and professional attributes (implemented via placeholders) enable systematic bias and fairness studies. We also present a cost-effective, human-in-the-loop translation pipeline based on the TEaR methodology, incorporating MQM error annotations and selective post-editing to ensure an high-quality multi-way parallel benchmark. We provide a baseline evaluations across multiple open-weight LLM families using an LLM-as-judge approach revealing higher performances on English and Spanish but substantial degradation for other languages, highlighting critical gaps in multilingual MRC capabilities for HR applications.

Recent latent reasoning methods attempt to mitigate this by compressing reasoning processes into latent space, but often suffer from severe performance degradation due to the lack of appropriate compression guidance. In this study, we propose Rendered CoT-Guided variational Latent Reasoning (ReGuLaR), a simple yet novel latent learning paradigm resolving this issue. Fundamentally, we formulate latent reasoning within the Variational Auto-Encoding (VAE) framework, sampling the current latent reasoning state from the posterior distribution conditioned on previous ones. Specifically, when learning this variational latent reasoning model, we render explicit reasoning chains as images, from which we extract dense visual-semantic representations to regularize the posterior distribution, thereby achieving efficient compression with minimal information loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReGuLaR significantly outperforms existing latent reasoning methods across both computational efficiency and reasoning effectiveness, and even surpasses CoT through multi-modal reasoning, providing a new and insightful solution to latent reasoning.

Consequently, their reasoning capability is limited when dealing with complex scenes characterized by ambiguity and visual uncertainty. In contrast, human experts, when interpreting remote sensing images in such ambiguous cases, tend to actively query auxiliary images (such as higher-resolution, larger-scale, or temporally adjacent data) to conduct cross-verification and achieve more comprehensive reasoning. Inspired by this, we propose a reasoning-query-driven dynamic segmentation framework for FRSIs, named FarmMind. This framework breaks through the limitations of the static segmentation paradigm by introducing a reasoning-query mechanism, which dynamically and on-demand queries external auxiliary images to compensate for the insufficient information in a single input image. Unlike direct queries, this mechanism simulates the thinking process of human experts when faced with segmentation ambiguity: it first analyzes the root causes of segmentation ambiguities through reasoning, and then determines what type of auxiliary image needs to be queried based on this analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FarmMind achieves superior segmentation performance and stronger generalization ability compared with existing methods.

Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF) concerns safety risks from perception insufficiencies, particularly under adverse conditions where conventional detectors often falter. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate promising semantic reasoning, their quantitative effectiveness for safety-critical 2D object detection is underexplored. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of ten representative LVLMs using the PeSOTIF dataset, a benchmark specifically curated for long-tail traffic scenarios and environmental degradations. Performance is quantitatively compared against the classical perception approach, a YOLO-based detector. Experimental results reveal a critical trade-off: top-performing LVLMs (e.g., Gemini 3, Doubao) surpass the YOLO baseline in recall by over 25% in complex natural scenarios, exhibiting superior robustness to visual degradation. Conversely, the baseline retains an advantage in geometric precision for synthetic perturbations.

This mismatch gives rise to the partial token problem, which occurs when a user ends their prompt in the middle of the expected next-token, leading to distorted next-token predictions. Although this issue has been studied using arbitrary character prefixes, its prevalence and severity in realistic prompts respecting word boundaries remains underexplored. In this work, we identify three domains where token and \"word\" boundaries often do not line up: languages that do not use whitespace, highly compounding languages, and code. In Chinese, for example, up to 25% of word boundaries do not line up with token boundaries, making even natural, word-complete prompts susceptible to this problem. We systematically construct semantically natural prompts ending with a partial tokens; in experiments, we find that they comprise a serious failure mode: frontier LMs consistently place three orders of magnitude less probability on the correct continuation compared to when the prompt is \"backed-off\" to be token-aligned. This degradation does not diminish with scale and often worsens for larger models. Finally, we evaluate inference-time mitigations to the partial token problem and validate the effectiveness of recent exact solutions. Overall, we demonstrate the scale and severity of probability distortion caused by tokenization in realistic use cases, and provide practical recommentions for model inference providers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8etoken\u5e8f\u5217\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f46\u7528\u6237\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4\u90e8\u5206token\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u5f53\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u9884\u671ftoken\u4e2d\u95f4\u7ed3\u675f\u65f6\uff0c\u4f1a\u626d\u66f2\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2atoken\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u975e\u7a7a\u683c\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u9ad8\u5ea6\u590d\u5408\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u8d8a\u5927\u95ee\u9898\u8d8a\u4e25\u91cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8etoken\u5e8f\u5217\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u800c\u7528\u6237\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u6587\u672c\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u5bfc\u81f4\u90e8\u5206token\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u4efb\u610f\u5b57\u7b26\u524d\u7f00\u63a2\u8ba8\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5c0a\u91cd\u5355\u8bcd\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\u548c\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u8bc6\u522b\u4e09\u4e2atoken\u4e0e\"\u5355\u8bcd\"\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u9886\u57df\uff1a\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u7a7a\u683c\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u9ad8\u5ea6\u590d\u5408\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u6784\u5efa\u4ee5\u90e8\u5206token\u7ed3\u5c3e\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u81ea\u7136\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6982\u7387\u626d\u66f2\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e2d\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u9ad8\u8fbe25%\u7684\u5355\u8bcd\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0etoken\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u524d\u6cbf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u90e8\u5206token\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u5bf9\u6b63\u786e\u5ef6\u7eed\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5206\u914d\u6bd4token\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u793a\u4f4e\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u4e0d\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u51cf\u5c0f\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u7ecf\u5e38\u5728\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6076\u5316\u3002\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6700\u8fd1\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4f7f\u7528\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u7531token\u5316\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u6982\u7387\u626d\u66f2\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

However, improved tokenization in the first stage does not necessarily enhance the second-stage generation, as existing methods fail to constrain token dependencies. This mismatch forces the generative model to learn from unordered distributions, leading to bias and weak coherence. To address this, we propose native visual tokenization, which enforces causal dependencies during tokenization. Building on this idea, we introduce NativeTok, a framework that achieves efficient reconstruction while embedding relational constraints within token sequences. NativeTok consists of: (1) a Meta Image Transformer (MIT) for latent image modeling, and (2) a Mixture of Causal Expert Transformer (MoCET), where each lightweight expert block generates a single token conditioned on prior tokens and latent features.

This transition, however, introduces a distinct class of vulnerabilities that remain largely uncharacterized. We examine the security implications of this modality shift by designing a text-to-audio jailbreak that embeds disallowed directives within a narrative-style audio stream. The attack leverages an advanced instruction-following text-to-speech (TTS) model to exploit structural and acoustic properties, thereby circumventing safety mechanisms primarily calibrated for text. When delivered through synthetic speech, the narrative format elicits restricted outputs from state-of-the-art models, including Gemini 2.0 Flash, achieving a 98.26% success rate that substantially exceeds text-only baselines. These results highlight the need for safety frameworks that jointly reason over linguistic and paralinguistic representations, particularly as speech-based interfaces become more prevalent.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u97f3\u9891-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6587\u672c\u5230\u97f3\u9891\u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5728\u53d9\u4e8b\u5f0f\u97f3\u9891\u6d41\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u7981\u6b62\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7ed5\u8fc7\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u97f3\u9891-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u5904\u7406\u539f\u59cb\u8bed\u97f3\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u8f6c\u53d8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u5230\u97f3\u9891\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u8f6c\u53d8\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6587\u672c\u5230\u97f3\u9891\u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u6587\u672c\u8f6c\u8bed\u97f3\uff08TTS\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u53d9\u4e8b\u5f0f\u97f3\u9891\u6d41\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u88ab\u7981\u6b62\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u58f0\u5b66\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7ed5\u8fc7\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u653b\u51fb\u5728\u5305\u62ecGemini 2.0 Flash\u5728\u5185\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e8698.26%\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u8bed\u97f3\u4f20\u9012\u7684\u53d9\u4e8b\u683c\u5f0f\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5f15\u53d1\u53d7\u9650\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u526f\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8bed\u97f3\u63a5\u53e3\u65e5\u76ca\u666e\u53ca\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u3002"}}

Compared with traditional VTON task, it enables users to tailor digital avatars to their individual preferences, thereby enhancing the virtual fitting experience with greater flexibility and engagement. To address this task, we introduce a Neural Clothing Tryer (NCT) framework, which exploits the advanced diffusion models equipped with semantic enhancement and controlling modules to better preserve semantic characterization and textural details of the garment and meanwhile facilitating the flexible editing of the model's postures and appearances. Specifically, NCT introduces a semantic-enhanced module to take semantic descriptions of garments and utilizes a visual-language encoder to learn aligned features across modalities. The aligned features are served as condition input to the diffusion model to enhance the preservation of the garment's semantics. Then, a semantic controlling module is designed to take the garment image, tailored posture image, and semantic description as input to maintain garment details while simultaneously editing model postures, expressions, and various attributes.

Redundancy and Slimmability in Remote Sensing Foundation Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Large-scale foundation models (FMs) in remote sensing (RS) are developed based on the paradigms established in computer vision (CV) and have shown promise for various Earth observation applications. However, the direct transfer of scaling assumptions from CV to RS has not been adequately examined. We hypothesize that RS FMs enter an overparameterized regime at substantially smaller scales than their CV counterparts, where increasing parameter count primarily induces redundant representations rather than qualitatively new abstractions. To test this hypothesis, we use post-hoc slimming, where we uniformly reduce the width of pretrained encoder, as a tool to measure representational redundancy across six state-of-the-art RS FMs on four downstream classification tasks. Our findings reveal a significant contrast with those in the CV domain: while a post-hoc slimmed masked autoencoder (MAE) trained on ImageNet retains less than 10% accuracy at 1% FLOPs, RS FMs maintain over 71% relative accuracy at the same budget. This sevenfold difference provides strong empirical support for our hypothesis. We further demonstrate that learned slimmable training can improve both Momentum Contrast (MoCo)- and MAE- based models. In addition, through the explained variance ratio and the feature correlation analysis, we provide mechanistic explanations showing that RS FMs distribute task-relevant information with high redundancy. Our findings establish post-hoc slimmability as both a practical deployment strategy for resource-constrained environments and a diagnostic tool that challenges the prevailing scaling paradigm in RS.

Existing solutions rely on specialized sensors: either heavy, costly airborne LiDAR, or Airborne Optical Sectioning (AOS), which uses thermal synthetic aperture photography and is tailored for person detection.\n  We introduce a novel approach for the reconstruction of canopy-free, photorealistic ground views using only conventional RGB images. Our solution is based on the celebrated Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), a recent 3D reconstruction method. Additionally, we include specific image capture considerations, which dictate the needed illumination to successfully expose the scene beneath the canopy. To better cope with the poorly lit understory, we employ a low light loss. Finally, we propose two complementary approaches to remove occluding canopy elements by controlling per-ray integration procedure.\n  To validate the value of our approach, we present two possible downstream tasks. For the task of search and rescue (SAR), we demonstrate that our method enables person detection which achieves promising results compared to thermal AOS (using only RGB images).

Submitted to ICML 2026. 8 pages main text, plus appendix", "summary": "Anomaly detection is often formulated under the assumption that abnormality is an intrinsic property of an observation, independent of context. This assumption breaks down in many real-world settings, where the same object or action may be normal or anomalous depending on latent contextual factors (e.g., running on a track versus on a highway). We revisit \\emph{contextual anomaly detection}, classically defined as context-dependent abnormality, and operationalize it in the visual domain, where anomaly labels depend on subject--context compatibility rather than intrinsic appearance. To enable systematic study of this setting, we introduce CAAD-3K, a benchmark that isolates contextual anomalies by controlling subject identity while varying context.

We challenge this assumption by formalizing semantic leakage as the ability to recover semantic structures from compressed image embeddings. Surprisingly, we show that semantic leakage does not require exact reconstruction of the original image. Preserving local semantic neighborhoods under embedding alignment is sufficient to expose the intrinsic vulnerability of image embeddings. Crucially, this preserved neighborhood structure allows semantic information to propagate through a sequence of lossy mappings. Based on this conjecture, we propose Semantic Leakage from Image Embeddings (SLImE), a lightweight inference framework that reveals semantic information from standalone compressed image embeddings, incorporating a locally trained semantic retriever with off-the-shelf models, without training task-specific decoders. We thoroughly validate each step of the framework empirically, from aligned embeddings to retrieved tags, symbolic representations, and grammatical and coherent descriptions. We evaluate SLImE across a range of open and closed embedding models, including GEMINI, COHERE, NOMIC, and CLIP, and demonstrate consistent recovery of semantic information across diverse inference tasks. Our results reveal a fundamental vulnerability in image embeddings, whereby the preservation of semantic neighborhoods under alignment enables semantic leakage, highlighting challenges for privacy preservation.1", "AI": {"tldr": "\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u65e0\u6cd5\u7cbe\u786e\u91cd\u5efa\u539f\u56fe\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u4fdd\u6301\u5c40\u90e8\u8bed\u4e49\u90bb\u57df\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5c31\u80fd\u4ece\u538b\u7f29\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f", "motivation": "\u6311\u6218\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5373\u4f7f\u538b\u7f29\u5d4c\u5165\u4e5f\u80fd\u6cc4\u9732\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6784\u6210\u5a01\u80c1", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSLImE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u7ed3\u5408\u73b0\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u4ece\u72ec\u7acb\u538b\u7f29\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f", "result": "\u5728GEMINI\u3001COHERE\u3001NOMIC\u3001CLIP\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u5f00\u653e\u548c\u95ed\u6e90\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u8106\u5f31\u6027", "conclusion": "\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u90bb\u57df\u5bf9\u9f50\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u6cc4\u9732\u7684\u6839\u672c\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6311\u6218"}}

Unfortunately, existing approaches often suffer from limited reconstruction fidelity due to the loss of high-frequency details. In this work, we present the DINO Spherical Autoencoder (DINO-SAE), a framework that bridges semantic representation and pixel-level reconstruction. Our key insight is that semantic information in contrastive representations is primarily encoded in the direction of feature vectors, while forcing strict magnitude matching can hinder the encoder from preserving fine-grained details. To address this, we introduce Hierarchical Convolutional Patch Embedding module that enhances local structure and texture preservation, and Cosine Similarity Alignment objective that enforces semantic consistency while allowing flexible feature magnitudes for detail retention. Furthermore, leveraging the observation that SSL-based foundation model representations intrinsically lie on a hypersphere, we employ Riemannian Flow Matching to train a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) directly on this spherical latent manifold. Experiments on ImageNet-1K demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality, reaching 0.37 rFID and 26.2 dB PSNR, while maintaining strong semantic alignment to the pretrained VFM.

Preprint version; the final camera-ready version may differ", "summary": "Visual anomaly detection in real-world industrial settings faces two major limitations. First, most existing methods are trained on purely normal data or on unlabeled datasets assumed to be predominantly normal, presuming the absence of contamination, an assumption that is rarely satisfied in practice. Second, they assume no access to labeled anomaly samples, limiting the model from learning discriminative characteristics of true anomalies. Therefore, these approaches often struggle to distinguish anomalies from normal instances, resulting in reduced detection and weak localization performance. In real-world applications, where training data are frequently contaminated with anomalies, such methods fail to deliver reliable performance. In this work, we propose a robust anomaly detection framework that integrates limited anomaly supervision into the adaptive deviation learning paradigm. We introduce a composite anomaly score that combines three complementary components: a deviation score capturing statistical irregularity, an entropy-based uncertainty score reflecting predictive inconsistency, and a segmentation-based score highlighting spatial abnormality. This unified scoring mechanism enables accurate detection and supports gradient-based localization, providing intuitive and explainable visual evidence of anomalous regions. Following the few-anomaly paradigm, we incorporate a small set of labeled anomalies during training while simultaneously mitigating the influence of contaminated samples through adaptive instance weighting.

In practice, acquiring these distances depends on labour-intensive manual interpretation of animal observations across large camera trap video corpora. This study introduces and evaluates an only sparsely explored alternative: the integration of computer vision-based monocular depth estimation (MDE) pipelines directly into ecological camera trap workflows for great ape conservation. Using a real-world dataset of 220 camera trap videos documenting a wild chimpanzee population, we combine two MDE models, Dense Prediction Transformers and Depth Anything, with multiple distance sampling strategies. These components are used to generate detection distance estimates, from which population density and abundance are inferred. Comparative analysis against manually derived ground-truth distances shows that calibrated DPT consistently outperforms Depth Anything. This advantage is observed in both distance estimation accuracy and downstream density and abundance inference. Nevertheless, both models exhibit systematic biases. We show that, given complex forest environments, they tend to overestimate detection distances and consequently underestimate density and abundance relative to conventional manual approaches. We further find that failures in animal detection across distance ranges are a primary factor limiting estimation accuracy. Overall, this work provides a case study that shows MDE-driven camera trap distance sampling is a viable and practical alternative to manual distance estimation. The proposed approach yields population estimates within 22% of those obtained using traditional methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08MDE\uff09\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u76f8\u673a\u9677\u9631\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u7329\u7329\u79cd\u7fa4\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u4e30\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6821\u51c6\u540e\u7684DPT\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8eDepth Anything\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9ad8\u4f30\u8ddd\u79bb\u3001\u4f4e\u4f30\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u603b\u4f53\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u572822%\u4ee5\u5185\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5927\u7329\u7329\u79cd\u7fa4\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u4e30\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u9700\u8981\u4eba\u5de5\u6d4b\u91cf\u52a8\u7269\u5230\u76f8\u673a\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u91cf\u76f8\u673a\u9677\u9631\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u975e\u5e38\u8017\u65f6\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528220\u4e2a\u91ce\u751f\u9ed1\u7329\u7329\u79cd\u7fa4\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u9677\u9631\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u79cdMDE\u6a21\u578b\uff08Dense Prediction Transformers\u548cDepth Anything\uff09\u4e0e\u591a\u79cd\u8ddd\u79bb\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u68c0\u6d4b\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u63a8\u65ad\u79cd\u7fa4\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u4e30\u5ea6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u5730\u9762\u771f\u5b9e\u8ddd\u79bb\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u6821\u51c6\u540e\u7684DPT\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f30\u8ba1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u4e30\u5ea6\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8eDepth Anything\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u90fd\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u9ad8\u4f30\u68c0\u6d4b\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4f4e\u4f30\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u4e30\u5ea6\u3002\u52a8\u7269\u68c0\u6d4b\u5931\u8d25\u662f\u9650\u5236\u4f30\u8ba1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u603b\u4f53\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u768422%\u4ee5\u5185\u3002", "conclusion": "MDE\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u9677\u9631\u8ddd\u79bb\u91c7\u6837\u662f\u4eba\u5de5\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u8fd1\u7684\u79cd\u7fa4\u4f30\u8ba1\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u91ce\u751f\u52a8\u7269\u4fdd\u62a4\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6280\u672f\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Recent RL-based IQA methods built on MLLMs focus on generating visual quality descriptions and scores, ignoring two key reliability limitations: (i) although the model's prediction stability varies significantly across training samples, existing GRPO-based methods apply uniform advantage weighting, thereby amplifying noisy signals from unstable samples in gradient updates; (ii) most works emphasize text-grounded reasoning over images while overlooking the model's visual perception ability of image content. In this paper, we propose Q-Hawkeye, an RL-based reliable visual policy optimization framework that redesigns the learning signal through unified Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic Optimization and Perception-Aware Optimization. Q-Hawkeye estimates predictive uncertainty using the variance of predicted scores across multiple rollouts and leverages this uncertainty to reweight each sample's update strength, stabilizing policy optimization.

Markers are commonly used for robot self-localization and object identification. In the RoboCup Logistics League (RCLL), ArUco markers are employed both for robot localization and for identifying processing modules. Conventional recognition relies on OpenCV-based image processing, which detects black-and-white marker patterns. However, these methods often fail under noise, motion blur, defocus, or varying illumination conditions. Deep-learning-based recognition offers improved robustness under such conditions, but requires large amounts of annotated data. Annotation must typically be done manually, as the type and position of objects cannot be detected automatically, making dataset preparation a major bottleneck. In contrast, ArUco markers include built-in recognition modules that provide both ID and positional information, enabling automatic annotation. This paper proposes an automated annotation method for training deep-learning models on ArUco marker images. By leveraging marker detection results obtained from the ArUco module, the proposed approach eliminates the need for manual labeling. A YOLO-based model is trained using the automatically annotated dataset, and its performance is evaluated under various conditions.

Conventional slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR) methods are time-consuming and require multiple orthogonal stacks for reconstruction. While learning-based SVR approaches have significantly reduced the time required at the inference stage, they heavily rely on ground truth information for training, which is inaccessible in practice. To address these challenges, we propose GaussianSVR, a self-supervised framework for slice-to-volume reconstruction. GaussianSVR represents the target volume using 3D Gaussian representations to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. It leverages a simulated forward slice acquisition model to enable self-supervised training, alleviating the need for ground-truth volumes. Furthermore, to enhance both accuracy and efficiency, we introduce a multi-resolution training strategy that jointly optimizes Gaussian parameters and spatial transformations across different resolution levels. Experiments show that GaussianSVR outperforms the baseline methods on fetal MR volumetric reconstruction.

Steering offers a lightweight technique to improve model performance. However, steering, whether input-dependent or input-independent, achieves a meaningful trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness. In this work, we observe that steering vectors can generalize across inputs when tasks share aligned semantic intent. Based on this insight, we propose \\textbf{OSGA} (\\textbf{O}ne-shot \\textbf{S}teering with \\textbf{G}enerative \\textbf{A}nchor), an input-independent framework that improves model performance with a single optimization instance. OSGA first selects an informative sample via a variance-based data selection strategy and learns a single steering vector with a contrastive objective with generative anchor regularization. The resulting vector can be universally applied at a certain layer during inference time without modifying model parameters.

Existing paradigms rely on either large-scale retrieval, which requires storing a large number of image embeddings, grid-based classifiers that ignore geographic continuity, or generative models that diffuse over space but struggle with fine detail. We introduce an entity-centric formulation of geolocation that replaces image-to-image retrieval with a compact hierarchy of geographic entities embedded in Hyperbolic space. Images are aligned directly to country, region, subregion, and city entities through Geo-Weighted Hyperbolic contrastive learning by directly incorporating haversine distance into the contrastive objective. This hierarchical design enables interpretable predictions and efficient inference with 240k entity embeddings instead of over 5 million image embeddings on the OSV5M benchmark, on which our method establishes a new state-of-the-art performance. Compared to the current methods in the literature, it reduces mean geodesic error by 19.5\\%, while improving the fine-grained subregion accuracy by 43%.

However, related studies on event sensors are scarce or narrowly centered on semantic-level understanding. We introduce SEAL, the first Semantic-aware Segment Any Events framework that addresses Open-Vocabulary Event Instance Segmentation (OV-EIS). Given the visual prompt, our model presents a unified framework to support both event segmentation and open-vocabulary mask classification at multiple levels of granularity, including instance-level and part-level. To enable thorough evaluation on OV-EIS, we curate four benchmarks that cover label granularity from coarse to fine class configurations and semantic granularity from instance-level to part-level understanding. Extensive experiments show that our SEAL largely outperforms proposed baselines in terms of performance and inference speed with a parameter-efficient architecture. In the Appendix, we further present a simple variant of our SEAL achieving generic spatiotemporal OV-EIS that does not require any visual prompts from users in the inference.

To overcome these challenges, we introduce Hi-Light, a novel, training-free framework for high-fidelity, high-resolution, robust video relighting. Our approach introduces three technical innovations: lightness prior anchored guided relighting diffusion that stabilises intermediate relit video, a Hybrid Motion-Adaptive Lighting Smoothing Filter that leverages optical flow to ensure temporal stability without introducing motion blur, and a LAB-based Detail Fusion module that preserves high-frequency detail information from the original video. Furthermore, to address the critical gap in evaluation, we propose the Light Stability Score, the first quantitative metric designed to specifically measure lighting consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hi-Light significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative comparisons, producing stable, highly detailed relit videos.", "AI": {"tldr": "Hi-Light\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u7167\u660e\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u6280\u672f\u521b\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u95ea\u70c1\u3001\u7ec6\u8282\u635f\u5931\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u91cf\u5316\u5149\u7167\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u7167\u660e\u5177\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u521b\u610f\u6f5c\u529b\u548c\u5546\u4e1a\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5408\u9002\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3001\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u5149\u7167\u95ea\u70c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u7f16\u8f91\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u9000\u5316\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "Hi-Light\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6280\u672f\uff1a1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u4eae\u5ea6\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u951a\u5b9a\u5f15\u5bfc\u91cd\u7167\u660e\u6269\u6563\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e2d\u95f4\u91cd\u7167\u660e\u89c6\u9891\uff1b2) \u6df7\u5408\u8fd0\u52a8\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5149\u7167\u5e73\u6ed1\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5149\u6d41\u786e\u4fdd\u65f6\u95f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u800c\u4e0d\u5f15\u5165\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u7cca\uff1b3) LAB\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ec6\u8282\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u59cb\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Light Stability Score\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9996\u4e2a\u91cf\u5316\u5149\u7167\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHi-Light\u5728\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e2d\u90fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u9ad8\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u91cd\u7167\u660e\u89c6\u9891\u3002", "conclusion": "Hi-Light\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u7167\u660e\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5149\u7167\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u7ec6\u8282\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u7f3a\u4e4f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u7167\u660e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In contrast, many deployed systems already produce inexpensive automatic quality-control (QC) signals like model agreement, uncertainty measures, or learned mask-quality scores which can be used for further model training without additional ground-truth annotation. However, these signals can be noisy and biased, making preference-based fine-tuning susceptible to harmful updates. We study Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for segmentation from such noisy judges using proposals generated by a supervised base segmenter trained on a small labeled set. We find that outcomes depend strongly on how preference pairs are mined: selecting the judge's top-ranked proposal can improve peak performance when the judge is reliable, but can amplify harmful errors under weaker judges. We propose Region-Normalized DPO (RN-DPO), a segmentation-aware objective which normalizes preference updates by the size of the disagreement region between masks, reducing the leverage of harmful comparisons and improving optimization stability. Across two medical datasets and multiple regimes, RN-DPO improves sustained performance and stabilizes preference-based fine-tuning, outperforming standard DPO and strong baselines without requiring additional pixel annotations.", "AI": {"tldr": "RN-DPO\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u7684\u533a\u57df\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u566a\u58f0\u8d28\u91cf\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u989d\u5916\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u9700\u8981\u5bc6\u96c6\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u5df2\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u81ea\u52a8\u8d28\u91cf\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u5982\u6a21\u578b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u53f7\u5b58\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8e\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6709\u5bb3\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u533a\u57df\u5f52\u4e00\u5316DPO\uff08RN-DPO\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u504f\u597d\u66f4\u65b0\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u6709\u5bb3\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u7840\u5206\u5272\u5668\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u6848\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u4fe1\u53f7\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5206\u6b67\u533a\u57df\u5927\u5c0f\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0cRN-DPO\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6DPO\u548c\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u7a33\u5b9a\u504f\u597d\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u50cf\u7d20\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "conclusion": "RN-DPO\u4e3a\u5229\u7528\u566a\u58f0\u8d28\u91cf\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u533a\u57df\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u673a\u5236\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u566a\u58f0\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u989d\u5916\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

Technically, we address two core challenges in interleaved tool invocation. First, to mitigate attention dispersion induced by the heterogeneity of reasoning and tool-calling, we propose Task-Decoupled Attention Masking, which isolates per-step concentration while preserving shared global context. Second, to control context length growth in multi-turn interactions, we introduce a Verifiable Trajectory-Guided Reward that balances exploration coverage with reasoning efficiency. To support training at scale, we further develop a data synthesis pipeline and construct Seeker-173K, comprising 173K high-quality tool-interaction trajectories for effective supervised and reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments show that Video-o3 substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 72.1% accuracy on MLVU and 46.5% on Video-Holmes.

Open-domain video shot retrieval, which involves richer temporal structure and more complex semantics, still lacks systematic benchmarks and analysis. To fill this gap, we introduce ShotFinder, a benchmark that formalizes editing requirements as keyframe-oriented shot descriptions and introduces five types of controllable single-factor constraints: Temporal order, Color, Visual style, Audio, and Resolution. We curate 1,210 high-quality samples from YouTube across 20 thematic categories, using large models for generation with human verification. Based on the benchmark, we propose ShotFinder, a text-driven three-stage retrieval and localization pipeline: (1) query expansion via video imagination, (2) candidate video retrieval with a search engine, and (3) description-guided temporal localization. Experiments on multiple closed-source and open-source models reveal a significant gap to human performance, with clear imbalance across constraints: temporal localization is relatively tractable, while color and visual style remain major challenges. These results reveal that open-domain video shot retrieval is still a critical capability that multimodal large models have yet to overcome.", "AI": {"tldr": "ShotFinder\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u89c6\u9891\u955c\u5934\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b1,210\u4e2a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e94\u7c7b\u53ef\u63a7\u7ea6\u675f\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8868\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6587\u672c\u6216\u9759\u6001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u800c\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u89c6\u9891\u955c\u5934\u68c0\u7d22\u6d89\u53ca\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u590d\u6742\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faShotFinder\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5c06\u7f16\u8f91\u9700\u6c42\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u955c\u5934\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e94\u7c7b\u53ef\u63a7\u5355\u56e0\u7d20\u7ea6\u675f\uff1a\u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\u3001\u989c\u8272\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u98ce\u683c\u3001\u97f3\u9891\u548c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u68c0\u7d22\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u67e5\u8be2\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u5019\u9009\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u63cf\u8ff0\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7ea6\u675f\u7c7b\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff1a\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u76f8\u5bf9\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u800c\u989c\u8272\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u98ce\u683c\u4ecd\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u89c6\u9891\u955c\u5934\u68c0\u7d22\u662f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5c1a\u672a\u514b\u670d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u80fd\u529b\uff0cShotFinder\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

We fine-tune both Qwen2 and Qwen3 using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), leveraging the clear correctness signals and structured reasoning traces inherent in educational content. Despite training exclusively on 38 hours of children's educational videos, our approach achieves improvements of 8-14 points on DoraVQA and state-of-the-art 86.16\\% on CVBench, with strong transfer to Video-MME and NExT-QA, demonstrating effective generalization from narrow pedagogical content to broad multimodal understanding.

TaTa leverages Brownian Distance Covariance-a powerful statistical measure that captures both linear and nonlinear dependencies via pairwise distances-to dynamically adapt VLMs to new domains without training or back-propagation. This not only improves efficiency but also enhances stability by avoiding disruptive weight updates. TaTa further integrates attribute-enhanced prompting to improve vision-language inference with descriptive visual cues.

While recent OSOD models perform well on benchmarks, their behavior under realistic user prompting remains underexplored. In interactive XR settings, user-generated prompts are often ambiguous, underspecified, or overly detailed. To study prompt-conditioned robustness, we evaluate two OSOD models, GroundingDINO and YOLO-E, on real-world XR images and simulate diverse user prompting behaviors using vision-language models. We consider four prompt types: standard, underdetailed, overdetailed, and pragmatically ambiguous, and examine the impact of two enhancement strategies on these prompts. Results show that both models exhibit stable performance under underdetailed and standard prompts, while they suffer degradation under ambiguous prompts. Overdetailed prompts primarily affect GroundingDINO. Prompt enhancement substantially improves robustness under ambiguity, yielding gains exceeding 55% mIoU and 41% average confidence. Based on the findings, we propose several prompting strategies and prompt enhancement methods for OSOD models in XR environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728XR\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u589e\u5f3a\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u771f\u5b9eXR\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u793a\u5f80\u5f80\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u6216\u8fc7\u4e8e\u8be6\u7ec6\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u793a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86GroundingDINO\u548cYOLO-E\u4e24\u4e2aOSOD\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9eXR\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u56db\u79cd\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u793a\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u6807\u51c6\u3001\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u3001\u8fc7\u4e8e\u8be6\u7ec6\u3001\u8bed\u7528\u6a21\u7cca\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4e24\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd", "result": "\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u8fc7\u4e8e\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4e3b\u8981\u5f71\u54cdGroundingDINO\uff1b\u63d0\u793a\u589e\u5f3a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0cmIoU\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u8fc755%\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u63d0\u534741%", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9XR\u73af\u5883\u4e2dOSOD\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027"}}

We hypothesize that these failures arise because standard denoising objectives lack explicit incentives for geometric coherence. To address this, we introduce VideoGPA (Video Geometric Preference Alignment), a data-efficient self-supervised framework that leverages a geometry foundation model to automatically derive dense preference signals that guide VDMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This approach effectively steers the generative distribution toward inherent 3D consistency without requiring human annotations. VideoGPA significantly enhances temporal stability, physical plausibility, and motion coherence using minimal preference pairs, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in extensive experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "VideoGPA\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u5bc6\u96c6\u504f\u597d\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u6307\u5bfc\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u53473D\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f3D\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u7269\u4f53\u53d8\u5f62\u6216\u7a7a\u95f4\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u6807\u51c6\u53bb\u566a\u76ee\u6807\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u6fc0\u52b1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVideoGPA\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5229\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u5bc6\u96c6\u504f\u597d\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u6307\u5bfc\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff1b3\uff09\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff1b4\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u5c0f\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "VideoGPA\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "VideoGPA\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u6709\u6548\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u5206\u5e03\u671d\u5411\u5185\u5728\u76843D\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u3002"}}
