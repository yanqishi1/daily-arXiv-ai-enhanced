### [1] [DeBERTa-KC: A Transformer-Based Classifier for Knowledge Construction in Online Learning Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19858)
*Jindi Wang,Yidi Zhang,Zhaoxing Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeBERTa-KC是一个基于Transformer的模型，用于自动分类在线科学学习讨论中的知识建构水平，在YouTube科学频道评论数据集上取得了0.836的宏F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够自动分析非正式数字学习环境中知识建构水平的工具，以支持大规模的话语分析和认知参与评估。

Method: 扩展DeBERTa-v3模型，结合Focal Loss、Label Smoothing和R-Drop正则化处理类别不平衡问题，构建了端到端的可复现流程。

Result: 在10折分层交叉验证中，DeBERTa-KC的宏F1达到0.836±0.008，显著优于传统和Transformer基线模型，对高阶认知参与（Explore和Negotiate类别）表现出强敏感性。

Conclusion: 大语言模型能够有效捕捉非正式数字学习环境中知识建构的细微指标，为话语分析和认知参与评估提供了可扩展的理论驱动方法。

Abstract: This study presents DeBERTa-KC, a transformer-based model for automatic
classification of knowledge construction (KC) levels in online science learning
discourse. Using comments collected from four popular YouTube science channels
(2022--2024), a balanced corpus of 20,000 manually annotated samples was
created across four KC categories: \textit{nonKC}, \textit{Share},
\textit{Explore}, and \textit{Negotiate}. The proposed model extends DeBERTa-v3
with Focal Loss, Label Smoothing, and R-Drop regularization to address class
imbalance and enhance generalization. A reproducible end-to-end pipeline was
implemented, encompassing data extraction, annotation, preprocessing, training,
and evaluation. Across 10-fold stratified cross-validation, DeBERTa-KC achieved
a macro-F1 of $0.836 \pm 0.008$, significantly out-performing both classical
and transformer baselines ($p<0.01$). Per-category results indicate strong
sensitivity to higher-order epistemic engagement, particularly in
\textit{Explore} and \textit{Negotiate} discourse. These findings demonstrate
that large language models can effectively capture nuanced indicators of
knowledge construction in informal digital learning environments, offering
scalable, theory-informed approaches to discourse analysis and the development
of automated tools for assessing epistemic engagement.

### [2] [An Evaluation of the Pedagogical Soundness and Usability of AI-Generated Lesson Plans Across Different Models and Prompt Frameworks in High-School Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19866)
*Xincheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估五个主流大语言模型生成高中物理课程计划的质量，发现模型选择主要影响可读性，而提示框架结构对事实准确性和教学完整性影响更大。最佳配置是结合可读性优化的模型与RACE框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估AI生成课程计划的教学合理性和可用性，比较不同大语言模型和提示框架在生成教育内容方面的表现差异。

Method: 使用五个大语言模型和三种提示框架生成15个高中物理课程计划，通过四个自动化计算指标进行分析：可读性、事实准确性、课程标准对齐和认知需求。

Result: DeepSeek生成最易读的教学计划，Claude语言最密集；RACE框架产生最低的幻觉指数和最高的课程标准对齐；所有模型的学习目标主要集中在布鲁姆分类法的低阶层次。

Conclusion: 可读性主要由模型设计决定，而教学可靠性和课程对齐更依赖提示框架。最佳实践是结合可读性优化的模型、RACE框架和明确的概念清单。

Abstract: This study evaluates the pedagogical soundness and usability of AI-generated
lesson plans across five leading large language models: ChatGPT (GPT-5), Claude
Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, DeepSeek V3.2, and Grok 4. Beyond model choice,
three structured prompt frameworks were tested: TAG (Task, Audience, Goal),
RACE (Role, Audience, Context, Execution), and COSTAR (Context, Objective,
Style, Tone, Audience, Response Format).
  Fifteen lesson plans were generated for a single high-school physics topic,
The Electromagnetic Spectrum. The lesson plans were analyzed through four
automated computational metrics: (1) readability and linguistic complexity, (2)
factual accuracy and hallucination detection, (3) standards and curriculum
alignment, and (4) cognitive demand of learning objectives.
  Results indicate that model selection exerted the strongest influence on
linguistic accessibility, with DeepSeek producing the most readable teaching
plan (FKGL = 8.64) and Claude generating the densest language (FKGL = 19.89).
  The prompt framework structure most strongly affected the factual accuracy
and pedagogical completeness, with the RACE framework yielding the lowest
hallucination index and the highest incidental alignment with NGSS curriculum
standards. Across all models, the learning objectives in the fifteen lesson
plans clustered at the Remember and Understand tiers of Bloom's taxonomy. There
were limited higher-order verbs in the learning objectives extracted.
  Overall, the findings suggest that readability is significantly governed by
model design, while instructional reliability and curricular alignment depend
more on the prompt framework. The most effective configuration for lesson plans
identified in the results was to combine a readability-optimized model with the
RACE framework and an explicit checklist of physics concepts, curriculum
standards, and higher-order objectives.

### [3] [From Denoising to Refining: A Corrective Framework for Vision-Language Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19871)
*Yatai Ji,Teng Wang,Yuying Ge,Zhiheng Liu,Sidi Yang,Ying Shan,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReDiff是一个改进的离散扩散模型框架，通过主动精炼而非被动去噪来解决并行解码中的错误级联问题，显著提升了生成内容的连贯性和事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离散扩散模型存在训练-推理差异，导致并行解码时初始令牌错误会污染生成上下文，引发错误级联，造成语法错误和语义幻觉。

Method: 提出两阶段训练：第一阶段训练模型修正合成错误；第二阶段通过在线自校正循环，训练模型基于专家修正来精炼自己的错误草稿。

Result: ReDiff显著提高了生成内容的连贯性和事实准确性，实现了比传统去噪方法更稳定高效的并行生成。

Conclusion: 将生成过程从被动去噪重构为主动精炼，赋予模型识别和修正自身错误的能力，有效打破了错误级联问题。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a promising direction for
vision-language tasks, offering bidirectional context modeling and theoretical
parallelization. However, their practical application is severely hindered by a
train-inference discrepancy, which leads to catastrophic error cascades:
initial token errors during parallel decoding pollute the generation context,
triggering a chain reaction of compounding errors and leading to syntactic
errors and semantic hallucinations. To address this fundamental challenge, we
reframe the generation process from passive denoising to active refining. We
introduce ReDiff, a refining-enhanced diffusion framework that teaches the
model to identify and correct its own errors. Our approach features a two-stage
training process: first, we instill a foundational revision capability by
training the model to revise synthetic errors; second, we implement a novel
online self-correction loop where the model is explicitly trained to revise its
own flawed drafts by learning from an expert's corrections. This mistake-driven
learning endows the model with the crucial ability to revisit and refine its
already generated output, effectively breaking the error cascade. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ReDiff significantly improves the coherence and
factual accuracy of generated content, enabling stable and efficient parallel
generation far superior to traditional denoising methods. Our codes and models
are available at https://rediff-hku.github.io/.

### [4] [Stream: Scaling up Mechanistic Interpretability to Long Context in LLMs via Sparse Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19875)
*J Rosser,José Luis Redondo García,Gustavo Penha,Konstantina Palla,Hugues Bouchard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Sparse Tracing技术，使用动态稀疏注意力高效分析长上下文注意力模式，通过Stream算法在近线性时间和线性空间内实现大规模一次性可解释性分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型扩展到百万token上下文，传统机制可解释性技术因注意力复杂度呈二次方增长，在超过10万token时需要TB级内存，无法有效分析长上下文。

Method: 提出Stream算法，采用可编译的分层剪枝方法，通过二分搜索式细化估计每个头的稀疏注意力掩码，仅保留每个查询的前k个关键块，同时保持模型的下一个token行为。

Result: 在长思维链推理轨迹中识别思维锚点，剪枝97-99%的token交互；在RULER基准测试中保留关键检索路径，剪枝90-96%的交互，暴露从针到输出的分层路径。

Conclusion: Sparse Tracing为分析注意力模式和追踪信息流提供了实用的即插即用工具，无需TB级缓存，使长上下文可解释性在消费级GPU上可行，有助于民主化思维链监控。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale to million-token contexts, traditional
Mechanistic Interpretability techniques for analyzing attention scale
quadratically with context length, demanding terabytes of memory beyond 100,000
tokens. We introduce Sparse Tracing, a novel technique that leverages dynamic
sparse attention to efficiently analyze long context attention patterns. We
present Stream, a compilable hierarchical pruning algorithm that estimates
per-head sparse attention masks in near-linear time $O(T \log T)$ and linear
space $O(T)$, enabling one-pass interpretability at scale. Stream performs a
binary-search-style refinement to retain only the top-$k$ key blocks per query
while preserving the model's next-token behavior. We apply Stream to long
chain-of-thought reasoning traces and identify thought anchors while pruning
97-99\% of token interactions. On the RULER benchmark, Stream preserves
critical retrieval paths while discarding 90-96\% of interactions and exposes
layer-wise routes from the needle to output. Our method offers a practical
drop-in tool for analyzing attention patterns and tracing information flow
without terabytes of caches. By making long context interpretability feasible
on consumer GPUs, Sparse Tracing helps democratize chain-of-thought monitoring.

### [5] [Automated HIV Screening on Dutch EHR with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19879)
*Lang Zhou,Amrish Jhingoer,Yinghao Luo,Klaske Vliegenthart--Jongbloed,Carlijn Jordans,Ben Werkhoven,Tom Seinen,Erik van Mulligen,Casper Rokx,Yunlei Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种利用大语言模型分析非结构化电子健康记录文本，以确定患者是否需要进行HIV进一步检测的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HIV诊断研究主要关注结构化数据，但忽略了临床笔记等非结构化文本中可能包含的HIV风险相关信息。电子健康记录的普及为解决这一问题提供了新机会。

Method: 开发了一个新颖的流程，利用大语言模型分析非结构化的电子健康记录文本数据，评估患者进行HIV进一步检测的资格。

Result: 在伊拉斯谟大学医学中心鹿特丹分校的临床数据上进行的实验表明，该流程实现了高准确率，同时保持了较低假阴性率。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效利用非结构化文本数据进行HIV筛查，为早期诊断提供了新的可行途径。

Abstract: Efficient screening and early diagnosis of HIV are critical for reducing
onward transmission. Although large scale laboratory testing is not feasible,
the widespread adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers new
opportunities to address this challenge. Existing research primarily focuses on
applying machine learning methods to structured data, such as patient
demographics, for improving HIV diagnosis. However, these approaches often
overlook unstructured text data such as clinical notes, which potentially
contain valuable information relevant to HIV risk. In this study, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze
unstructured EHR text and determine a patient's eligibility for further HIV
testing. Experimental results on clinical data from Erasmus University Medical
Center Rotterdam demonstrate that our pipeline achieved high accuracy while
maintaining a low false negative rate.

### [6] [An Expert-grounded benchmark of General Purpose LLMs in LCA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19886)
*Artur Donaldson,Bharathan Balaji,Cajetan Oriekezie,Manish Kumar,Laure Patouillard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究首次对大型语言模型在生命周期评估中的表现进行了专家基准测试，评估了11个通用LLM在22个LCA相关任务上的表现，发现37%的响应包含不准确信息，幻觉率高达40%，但开放式模型在准确性和解释质量方面表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI和LLM在生命周期评估中的应用日益增多，但缺乏对其可靠性、鲁棒性和可用性的系统性证据，且该领域缺乏标准化评估框架和明确的地面真实值。

Method: 评估了11个通用LLM（包括商业和开源模型）在22个LCA相关任务上的表现，由17位经验丰富的从业者根据科学准确性、解释质量、鲁棒性、可验证性和指令遵循等标准审查模型输出，共收集168份专家评审。

Result: 专家判定37%的响应包含不准确或误导性信息；准确性和解释质量评分普遍为中等或良好；幻觉率差异显著，某些模型的幻觉引用率高达40%；开放式模型在准确性和解释质量等标准上表现优于或与封闭式模型相当。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在LCA中简单应用LLM的风险（如将其视为自由形式的神谕），同时也显示了其在解释质量和减轻简单任务劳动强度方面的益处，但使用无基础机制的通用LLM存在风险。

Abstract: Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular large language
models (LLMs), are increasingly being explored as tools to support life cycle
assessment (LCA). While demonstrations exist across environmental and social
domains, systematic evidence on their reliability, robustness, and usability
remains limited. This study provides the first expert-grounded benchmark of
LLMs in LCA, addressing the absence of standardized evaluation frameworks in a
field where no clear ground truth or consensus protocols exist.
  Methods: We evaluated eleven general-purpose LLMs, spanning both commercial
and open-source families, across 22 LCA-related tasks. Seventeen experienced
practitioners reviewed model outputs against criteria directly relevant to LCA
practice, including scientific accuracy, explanation quality, robustness,
verifiability, and adherence to instructions. We collected 168 expert reviews.
  Results: Experts judged 37% of responses to contain inaccurate or misleading
information. Ratings of accuracy and quality of explanation were generally
rated average or good on many models even smaller models, and format adherence
was generally rated favourably. Hallucination rates varied significantly, with
some models producing hallucinated citations at rates of up to 40%. There was
no clear-cut distinction between ratings on open-weight versus closed-weight
LLMs, with open-weight models outperforming or competing on par with
closed-weight models on criteria such as accuracy and quality of explanation.
  Conclusion: These findings highlight the risks of applying LLMs na\"ively in
LCA, such as when LLMs are treated as free-form oracles, while also showing
benefits especially around quality of explanation and alleviating labour
intensiveness of simple tasks. The use of general-purpose LLMs without
grounding mechanisms presents ...

### [7] [Can They Dixit? Yes they Can! Dixit as a Playground for Multimodal Language Model Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19892)
*Nishant Balepur,Dang Nguyen,Dayeon Ki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于游戏的评估方法来全面评估多模态大语言模型(MLM)的能力，具体通过Dixit卡牌游戏实现，该游戏需要多种能力且具有客观规则，能克服传统基准测试的主观性和模型利用表面捷径的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MLM评估方法存在静态基准无法联合评估、依赖主观的人工或模型对比、模型可能利用表面捷径（如冗长回答）来虚增胜率等问题，需要更全面客观的评估框架。

Method: 使用Dixit卡牌游戏作为评估平台，玩家需要为卡片生成能迷惑部分但非全部玩家的标题，通过游戏胜率来评估MLM的综合能力，并与五个MLM在流行基准上的表现进行对比。

Result: Dixit游戏胜率排名与流行MLM基准排名完全相关，同时揭示了人类与MLM玩家在游戏策略上的差异以及MLM推理能力的改进空间。

Conclusion: 基于游戏的评估方法为MLM提供了更全面、客观和有趣的评估框架，能够有效揭示模型的能力差异和改进方向。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLMs) are often assessed on static,
individual benchmarks -- which cannot jointly assess MLM capabilities in a
single task -- or rely on human or model pairwise comparisons -- which is
highly subjective, expensive, and allows models to exploit superficial
shortcuts (e.g., verbosity) to inflate their win-rates. To overcome these
issues, we propose game-based evaluations to holistically assess MLM
capabilities. Games require multiple abilities for players to win, are
inherently competitive, and are governed by fix, objective rules, and makes
evaluation more engaging, providing a robust framework to address the
aforementioned challenges. We manifest this evaluation specifically through
Dixit, a fantasy card game where players must generate captions for a card that
trick some, but not all players, into selecting the played card. Our
quantitative experiments with five MLMs show Dixit win-rate rankings are
perfectly correlated with those on popular MLM benchmarks, while games between
human and MLM players in Dixit reveal several differences between agent
strategies and areas of improvement for MLM reasoning.

### [8] [Large Language Model enabled Mathematical Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19895)
*Guoyun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估DeepSeek-R1在运筹学优化建模中的潜力，通过四个基准测试和多种缓解幻觉策略来提升模型在自然语言到数学公式转换中的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化方法依赖领域专家将实际问题转化为数学模型，而大型语言模型有望通过自然语言理解和代码生成能力来弥合这一公式化差距。

Method: 使用DeepSeek-R1模型，在NL4OPT、IndustryOR、EasyLP和ComplexOR四个基准上进行系统评估，采用LLM-as-a-Judge、Few-shot Learning、Tool Calling和多智能体框架等策略来减少幻觉。

Result: DeepSeek-R1作为成本效益高且性能优异的模型，在LiveCodeBench和Math-500等基准上表现出色，但在应用运筹学场景中的有效性仍需探索。

Conclusion: 通过系统评估和幻觉缓解策略，DeepSeek-R1有望成为连接自然语言问题描述与数学优化模型的有效工具，提升运筹学决策制定的效率。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with optimization modeling
offers a promising avenue for advancing decision-making in operations research
(OR). Traditional optimization methods,such as linear programming, mixed
integer programming, and simulation depend heavily on domain expertise to
translate real-world problems into solvable mathematical models. While solvers
like Gurobi and COPT are powerful, expert input remains essential for defining
objectives, constraints, and variables. This research investigates the
potential of LLMs, specifically the DeepSeek-R1 model, to bridge this
formulation gap using natural language understanding and code generation.
Although prior models like GPT-4, Claude, and Bard have shown strong
performance in NLP and reasoning tasks, their high token costs and tendency
toward hallucinations limit real-world applicability in supply chain contexts.
In contrast, DeepSeek-R1, a cost-efficient and high-performing model trained
with reinforcement learning, presents a viable alternative. Despite its success
in benchmarks such as LiveCodeBench and Math-500, its effectiveness in applied
OR scenarios remains under explored. This study systematically evaluates
DeepSeek-R1 across four key OR benchmarks: NL4OPT, IndustryOR, EasyLP, and
ComplexOR. Our methodology includes baseline assessments, the development of a
hallucination taxonomy, and the application of mitigation strategies like
LLM-as-a-Judge, Few-shot Learning (FSL), Tool Calling, and a Multi-agent
Framework. These techniques aim to reduce hallucinations, enhance formulation
accuracy, and better align model outputs with user intent.

### [9] [Learning from Supervision with Semantic and Episodic Memory: A Reflective Approach to Agent Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19897)
*Jackson Hassell,Dan Zhang,Hannah Kim,Tom Mitchell,Estevam Hruschka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于记忆增强的LLM代理框架，通过存储实例级批评和语义级指导来提升分类任务性能，无需参数更新即可实现高达24.8%的准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微调方法成本高、灵活性差且不透明，需要一种更高效、可解释的方法让LLM代理从标记示例中学习分类函数。

Method: 使用记忆增强框架，包含情景记忆存储实例级批评和语义记忆提炼可重用的任务级指导，结合标签数据和LLM生成的批评。

Result: 在多样化任务中，融入批评比仅依赖标签的检索式基线方法准确率提升高达24.8%，并揭示了OpenAI与开源模型在处理事实导向与偏好数据时的行为差异。

Conclusion: 记忆驱动的反思性学习为构建更具适应性和可解释性的LLM代理提供了前景，通过建议性指标揭示了模型特性与记忆策略如何共同塑造学习动态。

Abstract: We investigate how agents built on pretrained large language models can learn
target classification functions from labeled examples without parameter
updates. While conventional approaches like fine-tuning are often costly,
inflexible, and opaque, we propose a memory-augmented framework that leverages
both labeled data and LLM-generated critiques. Our framework uses episodic
memory to store instance-level critiques-capturing specific past
experiences-and semantic memory to distill these into reusable, task-level
guidance. Across a diverse set of tasks, incorporating critiques yields up to a
24.8 percent accuracy improvement over retrieval-based (RAG-style) baselines
that rely only on labels. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we uncover
distinct behavioral differences between OpenAI and opensource models,
particularly in how they handle fact-oriented versus preference-based data. To
interpret how models respond to different representations of supervision
encoded in memory, we introduce a novel metric, suggestibility. This helps
explain observed behaviors and illuminates how model characteristics and memory
strategies jointly shape learning dynamics. Our findings highlight the promise
of memory-driven, reflective learning for building more adaptive and
interpretable LLM agents.

### [10] [LyriCAR: A Difficulty-Aware Curriculum Reinforcement Learning Framework For Controllable Lyric Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19967)
*Le Ren,Xiangjian Zeng,Qingqiang Wu,Ruoxuan Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LyriCAR是一个无监督的歌词翻译框架，通过难度感知课程设计和自适应课程策略，在EN-ZH歌词翻译任务上取得了最先进的结果，训练步骤减少近40%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有歌词翻译方法依赖手工规则和句子级建模，难以内化音乐语言模式和在段落级别实现有效泛化，其中跨行连贯性和全局押韵至关重要。

Method: 提出LyriCAR框架，包含难度感知课程设计器和自适应课程策略，通过逐步增加复杂度的挑战来指导模型训练，实现高效资源分配和加速收敛。

Result: 在EN-ZH歌词翻译任务上，LyriCAR在标准翻译指标和多维奖励分数上都达到了最先进水平，自适应课程策略将训练步骤减少了近40%且保持优异性能。

Conclusion: LyriCAR通过无监督方式和课程学习策略，有效解决了歌词翻译中的音乐约束平衡问题，显著提升了翻译质量和训练效率。

Abstract: Lyric translation is a challenging task that requires balancing multiple
musical constraints. Existing methods often rely on hand-crafted rules and
sentence-level modeling, which restrict their ability to internalize
musical-linguistic patterns and to generalize effectively at the paragraph
level, where cross-line coherence and global rhyme are crucial. In this work,
we propose LyriCAR, a novel framework for controllable lyric translation that
operates in a fully unsupervised manner. LyriCAR introduces a difficulty-aware
curriculum designer and an adaptive curriculum strategy, ensuring efficient
allocation of training resources, accelerating convergence, and improving
overall translation quality by guiding the model with increasingly complex
challenges. Extensive experiments on the EN-ZH lyric translation task show that
LyriCAR achieves state-of-the-art results across both standard translation
metrics and multi-dimensional reward scores, surpassing strong baselines.
Notably, the adaptive curriculum strategy reduces training steps by nearly 40%
while maintaining superior performance. Code, data and model can be accessed at

### [11] [LLM-Augmented Symbolic NLU System for More Reliable Continuous Causal Statement Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19988)
*Xin Lian,Kenneth D. Forbus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合大型语言模型和符号自然语言理解的混合方法，旨在解决LLMs的幻觉问题和符号系统覆盖范围有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs依赖概率推理，容易产生事实幻觉和输出结构不一致的问题；符号NLU系统虽然可解释性强且能产生结构化表示，但覆盖范围有限且需要专业知识维护。

Method: 使用LLMs进行重述和文本简化以提供广泛覆盖，作为自动填补知识缺口的来源；使用符号NLU产生可用于推理和增量学习的结构化表示。

Result: 在从常识科学文本中提取和解释数量及因果规律的任务上，混合方法显著优于纯符号管道。

Conclusion: 混合方法结合了LLMs的广泛覆盖能力和符号NLU的结构化表示优势，取得了比单一方法更好的效果。

Abstract: Despite the broad applicability of large language models (LLMs), their
reliance on probabilistic inference makes them vulnerable to errors such as
hallucination in generated facts and inconsistent output structure in natural
language understanding (NLU) tasks. By contrast, symbolic NLU systems provide
interpretable understanding grounded in curated lexicons, semantic resources,
and syntactic & semantic interpretation rules. They produce relational
representations that can be used for accurate reasoning and planning, as well
as incremental debuggable learning. However, symbolic NLU systems tend to be
more limited in coverage than LLMs and require scarce knowledge representation
and linguistics skills to extend and maintain. This paper explores a hybrid
approach that integrates the broad-coverage language processing of LLMs with
the symbolic NLU capabilities of producing structured relational
representations to hopefully get the best of both approaches. We use LLMs for
rephrasing and text simplification, to provide broad coverage, and as a source
of information to fill in knowledge gaps more automatically. We use symbolic
NLU to produce representations that can be used for reasoning and for
incremental learning. We evaluate this approach on the task of extracting and
interpreting quantities and causal laws from commonsense science texts, along
with symbolic- and LLM-only pipelines. Our results suggest that our hybrid
method works significantly better than the symbolic-only pipeline.

*Michael A. Covington*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于依赖关系的自然语言句子解析算法，采用逐词处理方式，每个词在可连接时立即连接，模拟人脑解析机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种更接近人脑处理机制的自然语言解析方法，不同于传统的短语结构解析，采用依赖关系解析方式。

Method: 设计了一种逐词处理的依赖解析算法，每个词在可连接时立即连接到现有结构，算法最坏情况复杂度为O(n³)，但在人类语言中仅在小规模时出现最坏情况。

Result: 成功实现了基于依赖关系的自然语言解析算法，其处理方式更接近人脑解析机制。

Conclusion: 该依赖解析算法提供了一种有效的自然语言处理方式，其逐词处理机制与人脑解析过程相似，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: This paper presents a fundamental algorithm for parsing natural language
sentences into dependency trees. Unlike phrase-structure (constituency)
parsers, this algorithm operates one word at a time, attaching each word as
soon as it can be attached, corresponding to properties claimed for the parser
in the human brain. Like phrase-structure parsing, its worst-case complexity is
$O(n^3)$, but in human language, the worst case occurs only for small $n$.

### [13] [Beyond MedQA: Towards Real-world Clinical Decision Making in the Era of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20001)
*Yunpeng Xiao,Carl Yang,Mark Mai,Xiao Hu,Kai Shu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一范式来评估临床决策任务，将任务分为临床背景和临床问题两个维度，背景和问题越接近真实临床环境难度越高。总结了现有数据集设置、训练和测试时技术方法，并扩展了评估维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学数据集如MedQA主要依赖简化的问答形式，无法充分代表真实世界的临床决策过程，需要更贴近临床实际的评估方法。

Method: 提出基于临床背景和临床问题两个维度的统一评估范式，总结现有数据集设置，回顾训练时和测试时的技术方法，并扩展评估维度到效率、可解释性等方面。

Result: 建立了一个系统化的临床决策评估框架，能够更准确地反映LLMs在真实临床环境中的表现，为标准比较和临床意义LLMs的开发提供指导。

Conclusion: 该范式明确了假设条件，标准化了比较方法，为开发具有临床意义的大语言模型提供了系统指导，有助于推动LLMs在临床领域的实际应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical use. They are often
evaluated using datasets such as MedQA. However, Many medical datasets, such as
MedQA, rely on simplified Question-Answering (Q\A) that underrepresents
real-world clinical decision-making. Based on this, we propose a unifying
paradigm that characterizes clinical decision-making tasks along two
dimensions: Clinical Backgrounds and Clinical Questions. As the background and
questions approach the real clinical environment, the difficulty increases. We
summarize the settings of existing datasets and benchmarks along two
dimensions. Then we review methods to address clinical decision-making,
including training-time and test-time techniques, and summarize when they help.
Next, we extend evaluation beyond accuracy to include efficiency,
explainability. Finally, we highlight open challenges. Our paradigm clarifies
assumptions, standardizes comparisons, and guides the development of clinically
meaningful LLMs.

### [14] [Forging GEMs: Advancing Greek NLP through Quality-Based Corpus Curation and Specialized Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20002)
*Alexandra Apostolopoulou,Konstantinos Kanaris,Athanasios Koursaris,Dimitris Tsakalidis,George Domalis,Ioannis E. Livieris*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了希腊嵌入模型(GEM)，这是一个针对希腊语的新型transformer模型家族，通过精心策划的大规模语料库训练，在希腊语NLP任务中显著超越现有基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希腊语等形态丰富的中等资源语言在NLP发展中面临研究碎片化、架构单一和上下文长度受限等问题，特别是在法律等专业领域，现有模型通常局限于早期transformer架构和512个token的窗口，无法处理长法律文档。

Method: 构建多个大规模希腊语语料库，采用严格的质量驱动过滤和预处理方法；预训练并系统评估多种现代架构（如ELECTRA、ConvBERT、ModernBERT）；提出首个针对法律领域的希腊-英语双语嵌入模型。

Result: 在下游任务上的广泛实验表明，新模型类别证明了所提方法的有效性，特别是GEM-RoBERTa和GEM-ConvBERT模型显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 通过精心策划的数据和多样化的现代架构，成功开发了在希腊语NLP任务中表现优异的嵌入模型，为中等资源语言的处理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The advancement of natural language processing for morphologically rich,
moderately-resourced languages like Modern Greek is often hindered by a
fragmented research landscape, a lack of architectural diversity and reliance
on limited context-length models. This is particularly true in specialized,
high-value domains such as law, where existing models are frequently confined
to early transformer architectures with a restrictive 512-token window,
insufficient for analyzing long legal documents. To address these challenges,
this paper presents Greek Embedding Models, a new family of transformer models
for Greek language built upon a foundation of extensive, quality-driven data
curation. We detail the construction of several large-scale Greek corpora,
emphasizing a rigorous, quality-based filtering and preprocessing methodology
to create high-value training datasets from both general-domain and specialized
legal sources. On this carefully curated foundation, we pre-train and
systematically evaluate a diverse suite of modern architectures, which has not
previously applied to Greek language, such as ELECTRA, ConvBERT and ModernBERT.
Furthermore, we propose the first bilingual Greek-English Embedding Models
tailored for the legal domain. The extensive experiments on downstream tasks
demonstrate that the new class of models establish the effectiveness of the
proposed approach, highlighting that the GEM-RoBERTa and GEM-ConvBERT models
significantly outperform existing baselines.

TL;DR: 该博士论文通过引入多任务模型、架构修改和生成式上下文微调框架，改进了序列标注任务的迁移学习方法，显著提升了预训练语言模型在序列标注任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升预训练神经网络语言模型在序列标注任务上的迁移学习效果，解决传统方法在领域迁移、信息流限制和模型适配方面的不足。

Method: 1) 多任务模型：整合领域无关文本处理系统的额外信号；2) 架构修改：在自回归大语言模型中实现跨层双向信息流；3) 生成式上下文微调框架：结合监督式上下文微调和响应导向适配策略。

Result: 提出的模型、方法和框架表明，通过针对性迁移学习范式适配的预训练语言模型在序列标注任务上能达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: 预训练语言模型在序列标注任务中的最佳性能需要通过有针对性的迁移学习范式来实现，本文提出的三种改进方法为此提供了有效途径。

Abstract: This doctoral thesis improves the transfer learning for sequence labeling
tasks by adapting pre-trained neural language models. The proposed improvements
in transfer learning involve introducing a multi-task model that incorporates
an additional signal, a method based on architectural modifications in
autoregressive large language models, and a sequence labeling framework for
autoregressive large language models utilizing supervised in-context
fine-tuning combined with response-oriented adaptation strategies. The first
improvement is given in the context of domain transfer for the event trigger
detection task. The domain transfer of the event trigger detection task can be
improved by incorporating an additional signal obtained from a
domain-independent text processing system into a multi-task model. The second
improvement involves modifying the model's architecture. For that purpose, a
method is proposed to enable bidirectional information flow across layers of
autoregressive large language models. The third improvement utilizes
autoregressive large language models as text generators through a generative
supervised in-context fine-tuning framework. The proposed model, method, and
framework demonstrate that pre-trained neural language models achieve their
best performance on sequence labeling tasks when adapted through targeted
transfer learning paradigms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ToolScope通过自动合并冗余工具和智能检索相关工具，解决了LLM代理在使用外部工具时面临的工具冗余和上下文限制问题，显著提升了工具选择的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的工具集通常包含大量冗余工具，这些工具具有重叠的名称和描述，导致工具选择时产生歧义并降低准确性。同时，LLM面临严格的输入上下文限制，无法有效考虑大型工具集。

Method: ToolScope包含两个核心组件：(1) ToolScopeMerger with Auto-Correction：自动审计和修复工具合并，减少冗余；(2) ToolScopeRetriever：对每个查询进行工具排序和选择，仅保留最相关的工具，压缩工具集以适应上下文限制。

Result: 在三个最先进的LLM和三个开源工具使用基准测试上的评估显示，工具选择准确率提升了8.38%到38.6%。

Conclusion: ToolScope有效增强了LLM工具使用能力，通过减少工具冗余和智能检索机制，在保持准确性的同时解决了上下文限制问题。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents rely on external tools to solve complex
tasks, but real-world toolsets often contain redundant tools with overlapping
names and descriptions, introducing ambiguity and reducing selection accuracy.
LLMs also face strict input context limits, preventing efficient consideration
of large toolsets. To address these challenges, we propose ToolScope, which
includes: (1) ToolScopeMerger with Auto-Correction to automatically audit and
fix tool merges, reducing redundancy, and (2) ToolScopeRetriever to rank and
select only the most relevant tools for each query, compressing toolsets to fit
within context limits without sacrificing accuracy. Evaluations on three
state-of-the-art LLMs and three open-source tool-use benchmarks show gains of
8.38% to 38.6% in tool selection accuracy, demonstrating ToolScope's
effectiveness in enhancing LLM tool use.

Motivation: 现有多语言基准在捕捉低资源文化细微差别方面存在不足，需要专门的文化知识评估数据集。

Method: 构建了包含民间传统、烹饪艺术和方言的孟加拉语文化知识数据集BLanCK，并评估了多个多语言语言模型。

Result: 多语言模型在非文化类别表现良好，但在文化知识方面表现显著较差；提供上下文后所有模型性能都大幅提升。

Conclusion: 需要上下文感知架构和经过文化策划的训练数据来提升模型的文化知识理解能力。

Abstract: Recent progress in NLP research has demonstrated remarkable capabilities of
large language models (LLMs) across a wide range of tasks. While recent
multilingual benchmarks have advanced cultural evaluation for LLMs, critical
gaps remain in capturing the nuances of low-resource cultures. Our work
addresses these limitations through a Bengali Language Cultural Knowledge
(BLanCK) dataset including folk traditions, culinary arts, and regional
dialects. Our investigation of several multilingual language models shows that
while these models perform well in non-cultural categories, they struggle
significantly with cultural knowledge and performance improves substantially
across all models when context is provided, emphasizing context-aware
architectures and culturally curated training data.

Motivation: 增强小语言模型在专业领域（如医学问答）的推理能力，特别是在波斯语等资源较少语言中的应用

Method: 采用强化学习AI反馈(RLAIF)和直接偏好优化(DPO)，翻译医学问答数据集，生成包含正确和错误推理轨迹的对比数据对

Result: 训练后的模型在医学推理能力上显著提升，性能超过了使用5700万token训练的前代模型，尽管本方法仅使用了450万token的数据

Conclusion: 推理导向的训练方法在有限数据条件下开发领域特定语言模型具有高效性和有效性

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities in small language models is critical for
specialized applications such as medical question answering, particularly in
underrepresented languages like Persian. In this study, we employ Reinforcement
Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) and Direct preference optimization (DPO) to
improve the reasoning skills of a general-purpose Persian language model. To
achieve this, we translated a multiple-choice medical question-answering
dataset into Persian and used RLAIF to generate rejected-preferred answer
pairs, which are essential for DPO training. By prompting both teacher and
student models to produce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning responses, we
compiled a dataset containing correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories.
This dataset, comprising 2 million tokens in preferred answers and 2.5 million
tokens in rejected ones, was used to train a baseline model, significantly
enhancing its medical reasoning capabilities in Persian. Remarkably, the
resulting model outperformed its predecessor, gaokerena-V, which was trained on
approximately 57 million tokens, despite leveraging a much smaller dataset.
These results highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of reasoning-focused
training approaches in developing domain-specific language models with limited
data availability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型创造力评估方法分散且不一致，缺乏一个全面的评估框架来跨不同场景评估LLM的创造力。

Method: 提出CreativityPrism框架，将创造力分解为质量、新颖性和多样性三个维度，包含9个任务、3个领域（发散思维、创意写作和逻辑推理）和20个评估指标。

Result: 专有模型和开源模型存在显著差距；同一领域内任务表现高度相关，跨领域相关性较弱；多样性和质量指标强相关，新颖性与其他维度相关性较弱。

Conclusion: 在某一创造力任务或维度上的强表现不一定能推广到其他方面，强调了全面评估LLM创造力的必要性。

Abstract: Creativity is often seen as a hallmark of human intelligence. While large
language models (LLMs) are increasingly perceived as producing creative text,
there is still no holistic framework to evaluate their creativity across
diverse scenarios. Existing evaluation methods remain fragmented, with dramatic
variation across domains and tasks, largely due to differing definitions and
measurements of creativity. Inspired by the hypothesis that creativity is not
one fixed idea, we propose CreativityPrism, an evaluation analysis framework
that decomposes creativity into three dimensions: quality, novelty, and
diversity. CreativityPrism incorporates nine tasks, three domains, i.e.,
divergent thinking, creative writing, and logical reasoning, and twenty
evaluation metrics, which measure each dimension in task-specific, unique ways.
We evaluate 17 state-of-the-art (SoTA) proprietary and open-sourced LLMs on
CreativityPrism and analyze the performance correlations among different
metrics and task domains. Our results reveal a notable gap between proprietary
and open-source models. Overall, model performance tends to be highly
correlated across tasks within the same domain and less so across different
domains. Among evaluation dimensions, diversity and quality metrics show strong
correlations - models that perform well on one often excel on the other -
whereas novelty exhibits much weaker correlation with either. These findings
support our hypothesis that strong performance in one creativity task or
dimension does not necessarily generalize to others, underscoring the need for
a holistic evaluation of LLM creativity.

TL;DR: ARTER是一个无需深度微调的实体链接框架，通过自适应路由和选择性推理，在保持高效的同时实现高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统实体链接方法依赖大量标注数据和模型微调，而现有的少样本方法虽然减少了训练需求，但存在LLM推理效率低下的问题。

Method: 采用结构化流水线，结合候选生成、基于上下文的评分、自适应路由和选择性推理，将上下文提及分类为简单和困难案例，分别由低计算实体链接器和针对性LLM推理处理。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，ARTER比ReFinED性能提升高达+4.47%，在6个数据集中的5个上平均增益+2.53%，且效率是使用LLM推理所有提及的管线的两倍。

Conclusion: ARTER在无需深度微调的情况下实现了高性能实体链接，通过智能路由显著提高了效率，为实体链接提供了一种平衡性能和效率的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Entity Linking (EL) has traditionally relied on large annotated datasets and
extensive model fine-tuning. While recent few-shot methods leverage large
language models (LLMs) through prompting to reduce training requirements, they
often suffer from inefficiencies due to expensive LLM-based reasoning. ARTER
(Adaptive Routing and Targeted Entity Reasoning) presents a structured pipeline
that achieves high performance without deep fine-tuning by strategically
combining candidate generation, context-based scoring, adaptive routing, and
selective reasoning. ARTER computes a small set of complementary signals(both
embedding and LLM-based) over the retrieved candidates to categorize contextual
mentions into easy and hard cases. The cases are then handled by a
low-computational entity linker (e.g. ReFinED) and more expensive targeted
LLM-based reasoning respectively. On standard benchmarks, ARTER outperforms
ReFinED by up to +4.47%, with an average gain of +2.53% on 5 out of 6 datasets,
and performs comparably to pipelines using LLM-based reasoning for all
mentions, while being as twice as efficient in terms of the number of LLM
tokens.

TL;DR: BoundRL是一种新颖高效的文本分割方法，通过联合执行token级文本分割和标签预测，仅生成起始token序列并在原文本中定位，大幅降低推理成本并减少幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着结构化文本在技术报告和生成式AI提示等领域的复杂性增加，传统句子或段落级分割方法无法有效处理包含表格、代码片段和占位符等元素的文本，需要更有效的语义分割方法。

Method: BoundRL采用强化学习与可验证奖励(RLVR)，通过专门设计的奖励函数联合优化文档重建保真度和语义对齐。为避免熵崩溃，通过系统扰动部分生成的段序列构建中间候选方案。

Result: 实验表明，BoundRL使小型语言模型(1.7B参数)在复杂提示分割任务上优于大型模型的少样本提示。RLVR相比监督微调有显著改进，加入中间候选方案进一步提升了性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: BoundRL为处理复杂结构化文本提供了一种高效的分割解决方案，在降低计算成本的同时实现了更好的分割性能。

Abstract: As structured texts become increasingly complex across diverse domains --
from technical reports to generative AI prompts -- the need for text
segmentation into semantically meaningful components becomes critical. Such
texts often contain elements beyond plain language, including tables, code
snippets, and placeholders, which conventional sentence- or paragraph-level
segmentation methods cannot handle effectively. To address this challenge, we
propose BoundRL, a novel and efficient approach that jointly performs
token-level text segmentation and label prediction for long structured texts.
Instead of generating complete contents for each segment, it generates only a
sequence of starting tokens and reconstructs the complete contents by locating
these tokens within the original texts, thereby reducing inference costs by
orders of magnitude and minimizing hallucination. To adapt the model for the
output format, BoundRL~performs reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards
(RLVR) with a specifically designed reward that jointly optimizes document
reconstruction fidelity and semantic alignment. To mitigate entropy collapse,
it further constructs intermediate candidates by systematically perturbing a
fraction of generated sequences of segments to create stepping stones toward
higher-quality solutions. To demonstrate BoundRL's effectiveness on
particularly challenging structured texts, we focus evaluation on complex
prompts used for LLM applications. Experiments show that BoundRL enables small
language models (1.7B parameters) to outperform few-shot prompting of much
larger models. Moreover, RLVR with our designed reward yields significant
improvements over supervised fine-tuning, and incorporating intermediate
candidates further improves both performance and generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型从预训练数据中继承了刻板印象，导致在自然语言处理任务中对某些社会群体产生偏见行为。然而，立场检测方法中的这种偏见评估在社区中被很大程度上忽视了。

Method: 在现有立场检测数据集中自动标注帖子的两个属性：特定群体的方言或语言风格，以及文本复杂度/可读性，以研究这些属性是否影响模型的立场检测决策。

Result: 结果显示LLMs在立场检测任务中表现出显著的刻板印象，例如错误地将支持大麻的观点与低文本复杂度关联，将非洲裔美国人方言与反对唐纳德·特朗普关联。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在零样本立场检测中存在明显的刻板印象偏见，需要进一步研究和缓解这种偏见问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models inherit stereotypes from their pretraining data,
leading to biased behavior toward certain social groups in many Natural
Language Processing tasks, such as hateful speech detection or sentiment
analysis. Surprisingly, the evaluation of this kind of bias in stance detection
methods has been largely overlooked by the community. Stance Detection involves
labeling a statement as being against, in favor, or neutral towards a specific
target and is among the most sensitive NLP tasks, as it often relates to
political leanings. In this paper, we focus on the bias of Large Language
Models when performing stance detection in a zero-shot setting. We
automatically annotate posts in pre-existing stance detection datasets with two
attributes: dialect or vernacular of a specific group and text
complexity/readability, to investigate whether these attributes influence the
model's stance detection decisions. Our results show that LLMs exhibit
significant stereotypes in stance detection tasks, such as incorrectly
associating pro-marijuana views with low text complexity and African American
dialect with opposition to Donald Trump.

Motivation: 当前搜索代理缺乏同时进行深度多跳推理和广域信息收集的能力，这在市场分析和业务发展等实际应用中至关重要。

Method: 通过转换现有数据集构建了包含220个问题的基准，这些问题需要处理大量数据并进行深度多跳检索推理。

Result: 实验显示最先进代理在DeepWideSearch上的平均成功率仅为2.39%，揭示了深度和广度搜索整合的挑战。错误分析识别了四种失败模式。

Conclusion: DeepWideSearch基准暴露了当前代理架构的关键限制，旨在推动更强大和稳健的信息搜索代理研究。

Abstract: Current search agents fundamentally lack the ability to simultaneously
perform \textit{deep} reasoning over multi-hop retrieval and
\textit{wide}-scale information collection-a critical deficiency for real-world
applications like comprehensive market analysis and business development. To
bridge this gap, we introduce DeepWideSearch, the first benchmark explicitly
designed to evaluate agents to integrate depth and width in information
seeking. In DeepWideSearch, agents must process a large volume of data, each
requiring deep reasoning over multi-hop retrieval paths. Specifically, we
propose two methods to converse established datasets, resulting in a curated
collection of 220 questions spanning 15 diverse domains. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that even state-of-the-art agents achieve only 2.39% average
success rate on DeepWideSearch, highlighting the substantial challenge of
integrating depth and width search in information-seeking tasks. Furthermore,
our error analysis reveals four failure modes: lack of reflection, overreliance
on internal knowledge, insufficient retrieval, and context overflow-exposing
key limitations in current agent architectures. We publicly release
DeepWideSearch to catalyze future research on more capable and robust
information-seeking agents.

Conclusion: 结合结构化多智能体工作流程与强化学习，为表格理解任务提供了有前景的解决方案，证明了该方法在整合稳健推理与可靠表格处理方面的有效性。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over tables is a critical capability for many
real-world applications. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise on
this task, but current approaches remain limited. Fine-tuning based methods
strengthen language reasoning; yet they are prone to arithmetic errors and
hallucination. In contrast, tool-based methods enable precise table
manipulation but rely on rigid schemas and lack semantic understanding. These
complementary drawbacks highlight the need for approaches that integrate robust
reasoning with reliable table processing. In this work, we propose
Mixture-of-Minds, a multi-agent framework that decomposes table reasoning into
three specialized roles: planning, coding, and answering. This design enables
each agent to focus on a specific aspect of the task while leveraging code
execution for precise table manipulation. Building on this workflow, we
introduce a self-improvement training framework that employs Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) rollouts to generate pseudo-gold trajectories and optimize agents
with reinforcement learning (RL). Extensive experiments show that
Mixture-of-Minds delivers substantial gains, reaching 62.13% on TableBench and
surpassing OpenAI-o4-mini-high. These results demonstrate the promise of
combining structured multi-agent workflows with RL to advance table
understanding.

Motivation: 探索大语言模型在文本输入下的空间推理能力，评估其空间理解和计算能力，揭示语言与空间推理之间的差距。

Method: 使用五个任务测试LLMs：象限识别、几何变换、距离评估、单词搜索和瓷砖滑动，通过增加网格维度来扩展任务复杂度。

Result: LLMs在小规模任务中表现中等，但随着复杂度增加性能急剧下降，平均准确率损失42.7%，最高达84%，所有初始准确率超过50%的任务都至少损失48%的准确率。

Conclusion: 大语言模型缺乏稳健的空间表征能力，在语言与几何交叉领域的推理能力存在明显局限，为未来集成基准测试奠定基础。

Abstract: This paper explores the spatial reasoning capability of large language models
(LLMs) over textual input through a suite of five tasks aimed at probing their
spatial understanding and computational abilities. The models were tested on
both fundamental spatial reasoning and multi-step problem-solving within
structured grid-based environments using tasks such as quadrant identification,
geometric transformations, distance evaluation, word searches, and tile
sliding. Each task was scaled in complexity through increasing grid dimensions,
requiring models to extend beyond simple pattern recognition into abstract
spatial reasoning. Our results reveal that while LLMs demonstrate moderate
success in all tasks with small complexity and size, performance drops off
rapidly as scale increases, with an average loss in accuracy of 42.7%, and
reaching as high as 84%. Every test that began with over 50% accuracy showed a
loss of at least 48%, illustrating the consistent nature of the deterioration.
Furthermore, their struggles with scaling complexity hint at a lack of robust
spatial representations in their underlying architectures. This paper
underscores the gap between linguistic and spatial reasoning in LLMs, offering
insights into their current limitations, and laying the groundwork for future
integrative benchmarks at the intersection of language and geometry.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需解码的采样策略来近似计算语言模型对文本的边际概率，相比传统采样方法大幅降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代语言模型使用子词分词，但评估时只考虑特定分词方式的概率，而忽略了同一文本可能有多种分词方式。边际概率评估更准确但计算困难，传统采样方法需要昂贵的生成步骤。

Method: 研究解码无关的采样策略，这些策略不需要语言模型生成文本，而是使用模型和分词器无关的廉价采样方法。

Result: 解码无关采样策略在多个开源模型上提供了足够准确的边际概率估计，且运行时间成本仅为传统方法的一小部分。

Conclusion: 解码无关采样策略能够以较低成本有效近似语言模型的边际概率，适用于下游推理任务。

Abstract: Modern language models operate on subword-tokenized text in order to make a
trade-off between model size, inference speed, and vocabulary coverage. A side
effect of this is that, during inference, models are evaluated by measuring the
probability of only the specific tokenization produced as the output, despite
there being many possible ways to represent the same text with a subword
vocabulary. Recent studies have argued instead for evaluating LLMs by
marginalization - the probability mass of all tokenizations of a given text.
  Marginalization is difficult due to the number of possible tokenizations of a
text, so often approximate marginalization is done via sampling. However, a
downside of sampling is that an expensive generation step must be performed by
the LLM for each sample, which limits the number of samples that can be
acquired given a runtime budget, and therefore also the accuracy of the
approximation. Since computing the probability of a sequence given the
tokenization is relatively cheap compared to actually generating it, we
investigate sampling strategies that are decoding-free - they require no
generation from the LLM, instead relying entirely on extremely cheap sampling
strategies that are model and tokenizer agnostic.
  We investigate the approximation quality and speed of decoding-free sampling
strategies for a number of open models to find that they provide sufficiently
accurate marginal estimates at a small fraction of the runtime cost and
demonstrate its use on a set of downstream inference tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁症和PTSD经常共病且症状相关，但现有的自动评估方法通常是二元分类且针对单一障碍。临床诊断需要跨障碍的严重程度感知估计和决策支持解释。

Method: 统一的三模态情感严重程度框架：同步融合访谈文本（句子级transformer嵌入）、音频（log Mel统计特征）和面部信号（动作单元、注视、头部姿态描述符），通过校准的后期融合分类器输出抑郁症（PHQ-8；5类）和PTSD（3类）的分级严重程度。

Result: 在DAIC数据集上的分层交叉验证优于单模态/消融基线。融合模型在准确率和加权F1上与最强单模态基线相当，同时提高了决策曲线效用和噪声/缺失模态下的鲁棒性。对于PTSD，融合减少了回归误差并提高了类别一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法为情感临床决策提供了可重复的评估和临床医生在环支持，文本对抑郁症严重程度贡献最大，音频和面部线索对PTSD至关重要，归因分析与语言和行为标记一致。

Abstract: Depression and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often co-occur with
connected symptoms, complicating automated assessment, which is often binary
and disorder specific. Clinically useful diagnosis needs severity aware cross
disorder estimates and decision support explanations. Our unified tri modal
affective severity framework synchronizes and fuses interview text with
sentence level transformer embeddings, audio with log Mel statistics with
deltas, and facial signals with action units, gaze, head and pose descriptors
to output graded severities for diagnosing both depression (PHQ-8; 5 classes)
and PTSD (3 classes). Standardized features are fused via a calibrated late
fusion classifier, yielding per disorder probabilities and feature-level
attributions. This severity aware tri-modal affective fusion approach is demoed
on multi disorder concurrent depression and PTSD assessment. Stratified cross
validation on DAIC derived corpora outperforms unimodal/ablation baselines. The
fused model matches the strongest unimodal baseline on accuracy and weighted
F1, while improving decision curve utility and robustness under noisy or
missing modalities. For PTSD specifically, fusion reduces regression error and
improves class concordance. Errors cluster between adjacent severities; extreme
classes are identified reliably. Ablations show text contributes most to
depression severity, audio and facial cues are critical for PTSD, whereas
attributions align with linguistic and behavioral markers. Our approach offers
reproducible evaluation and clinician in the loop support for affective
clinical decision making.

*Beiya Dai,Yuliang Liu,Daozheng Xue,Qipeng Guo,Kai Chen,Xinbing Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ContextLM框架通过引入next-context预测目标增强标准预训练，提升语言模型对高层语义结构和长距离上下文关系的建模能力，同时保持与标准自回归评估范式的完全兼容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统next-token预测在捕捉高层语义结构和长距离上下文关系方面的局限性。

Method: 在标准预训练基础上增加next-context预测目标，利用未来token块产生的误差信号训练模型学习多token上下文的预测表示。

Result: 在GPT2和Pythia模型家族（最高15亿参数）上的实验表明，ContextLM在困惑度和下游任务性能上均带来一致提升。

Conclusion: next-context预测为构建更强语言模型提供了可扩展且高效的途径，能够以最小计算开销获得更好的长距离连贯性和更有效的注意力分配。

Abstract: Next-token prediction (NTP) is the cornerstone of modern large language
models (LLMs) pretraining, driving their unprecedented capabilities in text
generation, reasoning, and instruction following. However, the token-level
prediction limits the model's capacity to capture higher-level semantic
structures and long-range contextual relationships. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce \textbf{ContextLM}, a framework that augments standard
pretraining with an inherent \textbf{next-context prediction} objective. This
mechanism trains the model to learn predictive representations of multi-token
contexts, leveraging error signals derived from future token chunks. Crucially,
ContextLM achieves this enhancement while remaining fully compatible with the
standard autoregressive, token-by-token evaluation paradigm (e.g., perplexity).
Extensive experiments on the GPT2 and Pythia model families, scaled up to
$1.5$B parameters, show that ContextLM delivers consistent improvements in both
perplexity and downstream task performance. Our analysis indicates that
next-context prediction provides a scalable and efficient pathway to stronger
language modeling, yielding better long-range coherence and more effective
attention allocation with minimal computational overhead.

*Jan Buchmann,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出将引用失败与响应失败区分开，研究引用失败的发生原因和缓解方法，并提出了CITECONTROL基准和CITENTION框架来改善LLM的引用质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based RAG系统的引用本应简化响应验证，但当模型生成有用响应却未能完整引用证据时，就出现了引用失败。与之前工作不同，本文旨在将引用失败与响应失败区分开来。

Method: 采用两步法：(1) 研究引用失败的发生条件，通过CITECONTROL基准系统分析响应与证据关系对引用质量的影响；(2) 提出CITENTION框架，整合生成式、基于注意力和基于检索的方法来改善引用。

Result: 实验表明，失败率随关系复杂性增加而上升，结合多种引用方法可提升性能。CITENTION框架在CITECONTROL基准和迁移设置中显著改善了引用质量。

Conclusion: 通过区分引用失败与响应失败，并开发专门的基准和框架，可以有效识别和缓解LLM引用问题，提高RAG系统的可靠性。

Abstract: Citations from LLM-based RAG systems are supposed to simplify response
verification. However, this does not hold for citation failure, when a model
generates a helpful response, but fails to cite complete evidence. In contrast
to previous work, we propose to disentangle this from response failure, where
the response itself is flawed, and citing complete evidence is impossible. To
address citation failure, this work follows a two-step approach: (1) We study
when citation failure occurs and (2) how it can be mitigated. For step 1, we
extend prior work by investigating how the relation between response and
evidence affects citation quality. We introduce CITECONTROL, a benchmark that
systematically varies this relation to analyze failure modes. Experiments show
that failures increase with relational complexity and suggest that combining
citation methods could improve performance, motivating step 2. To improve LLM
citation efficiently, we propose CITENTION, a framework integrating generative,
attention-based, and retrieval-based methods. Results demonstrate substantial
citation improvements on CITECONTROL and in transfer settings. We make our data
and code publicly available.

TL;DR: 本研究首次系统评估过程奖励模型在表格问答任务中的应用，发现结合文本和代码验证的PRMs能帮助选择答案，但在领域外数据上泛化能力不足，且步骤验证与答案准确性相关性较弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然过程奖励模型在数学等领域能提升复杂推理能力，但在涉及半结构化数据的表格问答任务中的应用尚未探索，该任务存在信息冗余、推理步骤松散、领域特定推理等独特挑战。

Method: 从答案和步骤两个角度评估最先进的生成式PRMs在表格问答任务上的表现，分析文本和代码验证的结合效果。

Result: PRMs结合文本和代码验证能辅助解决方案选择，但在领域外数据上泛化能力差；步骤级验证性能与答案准确性相关性弱，可能源于步骤间依赖关系弱和因果联系松散。

Conclusion: 当前PRMs在表格问答任务上存在局限性，研究结果为构建更鲁棒的过程感知验证器提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) improve complex reasoning in large language
models (LLMs) by grading candidate solutions step-by-step and selecting answers
via aggregated step scores. While effective in domains such as mathematics,
their applicability to tasks involving semi-structured data, like table
question answering (TQA) remains unexplored. TQA poses unique challenges for
PRMs, including abundant irrelevant information, loosely connected reasoning
steps, and domain-specific reasoning. This work presents the first systematic
study of PRMs for TQA. We evaluate state-of-the-art generative PRMs on TQA from
both answer and step perspectives. Results show that PRMs that combine textual
and code verification can aid solution selection but struggle to generalize to
out-of-domain data. Analysis reveals a weak correlation between performance in
step-level verification and answer accuracy, possibly stemming from weak step
dependencies and loose causal links. Our findings highlight limitations of
current PRMs on TQA and offer valuable insights for building more robust,
process-aware verifiers.

TL;DR: CoRT是一个后训练框架，通过Hint-Engineering策略合成高质量代码集成推理数据，教导大型推理模型有效使用代码解释器，在数学推理任务上实现性能提升和效率优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂数学运算中表现不佳，虽然集成代码解释器是解决方案，但存在模型内部概率推理与外部确定性知识之间的冲突，导致无效的思考过程。

Method: 提出Hint-Engineering数据合成策略，在推理路径中战略性地注入多样化提示，生成高质量的代码集成推理数据，并通过监督微调、拒绝采样和强化学习优化模型与代码解释器的多轮交互。

Result: 在五个具有挑战性的数学推理数据集上，CoRT使32B和1.5B模型分别获得4%和8%的绝对提升，同时显著提高效率，32B模型减少约30%的token使用，1.5B模型减少约50%。

Conclusion: CoRT框架成功解决了大型推理模型与代码解释器交互中的冲突问题，显著提升了数学推理性能和效率，证明了后训练优化的有效性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI-o1 have shown impressive
capabilities in natural language reasoning. However, these models frequently
demonstrate inefficiencies or inaccuracies when tackling complex mathematical
operations. While integrating computational tools such as Code Interpreters
(CIs) offers a promising solution, it introduces a critical challenge: a
conflict between the model's internal, probabilistic reasoning and the
external, deterministic knowledge provided by the CI, which often leads models
to unproductive deliberation. To overcome this, we introduce CoRT
(Code-Optimized Reasoning Training), a post-training framework designed to
teach LRMs to effectively utilize CIs. We propose \emph{Hint-Engineering}, a
new data synthesis strategy that strategically injects diverse hints at optimal
points within reasoning paths. This approach generates high-quality,
code-integrated reasoning data specifically tailored to optimize LRM-CI
interaction. Using this method, we have synthesized 30 high-quality samples to
post-train models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters through supervised
fine-tuning. CoRT further refines the multi-round interleaving of external CI
usage and internal thinking by employing rejection sampling and reinforcement
learning. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate CoRT's effectiveness,
yielding absolute improvements of 4\% and 8\% on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B
and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, respectively, across five challenging
mathematical reasoning datasets. Moreover, CoRT significantly enhances
efficiency, reducing token usage by approximately 30\% for the 32B model and
50\% for the 1.5B model compared to pure natural language reasoning baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在表格推理任务中的表现可能受到数据集污染的影响，特别是当数据集包含语义线索时，模型表现较好；当去除这些线索后，性能降至随机水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在结构化数据上的推理能力时，往往忽略了数据集污染问题，即模型可能通过记忆公开数据集而非真正泛化来表现良好。

Method: 通过一系列受控探测实验，研究LLMs对常用表格基准数据集（如Adult Income、Titanic等）的先验知识，比较包含语义线索与去除/随机化线索时的性能差异。

Result: 当数据集包含强语义线索（如含义明确的列名、可解释的值类别）时，出现污染效应；当这些线索被移除或随机化后，性能急剧下降至接近随机水平。

Conclusion: LLMs在表格推理任务中的明显能力可能部分反映了对公开数据集的记忆而非真正的泛化能力，需要改进评估协议来区分语义泄漏与真实推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on their ability to
reason over structured data, yet such assessments often overlook a crucial
confound: dataset contamination. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs
exhibit prior knowledge of widely used tabular benchmarks such as Adult Income,
Titanic, and others. Through a series of controlled probing experiments, we
reveal that contamination effects emerge exclusively for datasets containing
strong semantic cues-for instance, meaningful column names or interpretable
value categories. In contrast, when such cues are removed or randomized,
performance sharply declines to near-random levels. These findings suggest that
LLMs' apparent competence on tabular reasoning tasks may, in part, reflect
memorization of publicly available datasets rather than genuine generalization.
We discuss implications for evaluation protocols and propose strategies to
disentangle semantic leakage from authentic reasoning ability in future LLM
assessments.

TL;DR: FreeChunker是一个跨粒度编码框架，将句子作为原子单元，从静态分块转向支持任意句子组合的灵活检索，显著提升检索性能和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分块方法采用固定粒度范式，依赖静态边界识别，限制了其对多样化查询需求的适应性。

Method: 将句子作为原子单元，从静态分块分割转向支持任意句子组合的灵活检索，减少语义边界检测的计算开销。

Result: 在LongBench V2上的实验评估显示，FreeChunker相比传统分块方法实现了更优的检索性能，同时在计算效率上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FreeChunker通过范式转换，不仅显著降低了语义边界检测的计算开销，还增强了对复杂查询的适应性。

Abstract: Chunking strategies significantly impact the effectiveness of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Existing methods operate within
fixed-granularity paradigms that rely on static boundary identification,
limiting their adaptability to diverse query requirements. This paper presents
FreeChunker, a Cross-Granularity Encoding Framework that fundamentally
transforms the traditional chunking paradigm: the framework treats sentences as
atomic units and shifts from static chunk segmentation to flexible retrieval
supporting arbitrary sentence combinations. This paradigm shift not only
significantly reduces the computational overhead required for semantic boundary
detection but also enhances adaptability to complex queries. Experimental
evaluation on LongBench V2 demonstrates that FreeChunker achieves superior
retrieval performance compared to traditional chunking methods, while
significantly outperforming existing approaches in computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索仅使用对话数据进行预训练是否能产生形式和功能上都合适的小型语言模型，并研究如何通过微调策略使模型生成更具交流性的文本。

Method: 基于预训练的llamalogue模型，采用多种微调策略（包括PPO和DPO）来增强模型的对话生成能力。

Result: 模型在大多数标准BabyLM基准测试中表现不佳，但在最小对设置中的对话延续预测方面表现优异；PPO微调效果参差不齐甚至有害，而DPO微调进一步提升了自定义对话基准的性能。

Conclusion: 仅使用对话数据预训练的小型语言模型在对话任务上具有潜力，DPO微调是提升对话性能的有效方法，但需要进一步改进以适应更广泛的语言理解任务。

Abstract: We investigate whether pre-training exclusively on dialogue data results in
formally and functionally apt small language models. Based on this pre-trained
llamalogue model, we employ a variety of fine-tuning strategies to enforce
"more communicative" text generations by our models. Although our models
underperform on most standard BabyLM benchmarks, they excel at dialogue
continuation prediction in a minimal pair setting. While PPO fine-tuning has
mixed to adversarial effects on our models, DPO fine-tuning further improves
their performance on our custom dialogue benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究否定文本对LLM幻觉的影响，探索LLMs能否识别否定引起的上下文变化并可靠检测幻觉。

Method: 构建NegHalu数据集，通过重构现有幻觉检测数据集加入否定表达；在token级别追踪LLMs处理否定输入时的内部状态。

Result: LLMs难以有效检测否定文本中的幻觉，常产生逻辑不一致或不忠实的判断。

Conclusion: 否定文本显著影响LLMs的幻觉检测能力，揭示了解释和缓解这一问题的挑战。

Abstract: Recent studies on hallucination in large language models (LLMs) have been
actively progressing in natural language processing. However, the impact of
negated text on hallucination with LLMs remains largely unexplored. In this
paper, we set three important yet unanswered research questions and aim to
address them. To derive the answers, we investigate whether LLMs can recognize
contextual shifts caused by negation and still reliably distinguish
hallucinations comparable to affirmative cases. We also design the NegHalu
dataset by reconstructing existing hallucination detection datasets with
negated expressions. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs struggle to detect
hallucinations in negated text effectively, often producing logically
inconsistent or unfaithful judgments. Moreover, we trace the internal state of
LLMs as they process negated inputs at the token level and reveal the
challenges of mitigating their unintended effects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的BERT模型虽然性能出色，但其架构选择相比Llama3和Qwen3等新型transformer模型已经过时。ModernBERT和NeoBERT在英语基准测试上表现出改进，作者希望为希伯来语文本开发类似的先进模型。

Method: 使用与NeoBERT相同的架构训练BERT风格模型，专门针对希伯来语文本进行训练，开发了单语（NeoDictaBERT）和双语（NeoDictaBERT-bilingual）两个版本。

Result: 这些模型在几乎所有希伯来语基准测试中都超越了现有模型，特别是NeoDictaBERT-bilingual在检索任务上表现出色，超越了类似规模的多语言模型。

Conclusion: NeoDictaBERT模型为希伯来语NLP研究和开发提供了强大的基础，作者已向社区发布这些模型以推动希伯来语NLP的发展。

Abstract: Since their initial release, BERT models have demonstrated exceptional
performance on a variety of tasks, despite their relatively small size
(BERT-base has ~100M parameters). Nevertheless, the architectural choices used
in these models are outdated compared to newer transformer-based models such as
Llama3 and Qwen3. In recent months, several architectures have been proposed to
close this gap. ModernBERT and NeoBERT both show strong improvements on English
benchmarks and significantly extend the supported context window. Following
their successes, we introduce NeoDictaBERT and NeoDictaBERT-bilingual:
BERT-style models trained using the same architecture as NeoBERT, with a
dedicated focus on Hebrew texts. These models outperform existing ones on
almost all Hebrew benchmarks and provide a strong foundation for downstream
tasks. Notably, the NeoDictaBERT-bilingual model shows strong results on
retrieval tasks, outperforming other multilingual models of similar size. In
this paper, we describe the training process and report results across various
benchmarks. We release the models to the community as part of our goal to
advance research and development in Hebrew NLP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 儿童与照顾者之间的多轮对话具有连续性特征——即对话者之间及时、直接且有意义的交流。本文旨在评估和改进BabyLM在多轮对话中的连续性表现。

Method: 提出ContingentChat教师-学生框架，使用新颖的对齐数据集进行后训练，并实验自适应教师解码策略。

Result: BabyLM生成的回复在语法和连贯性方面得到改善，但自适应教师解码策略带来的额外收益有限。

Conclusion: ContingentChat展示了针对性后训练对对话质量的益处，同时表明连续性对于BabyLM来说仍然是一个具有挑战性的目标。

Abstract: Multi-turn dialogues between a child and a caregiver are characterized by a
property called contingency - that is, prompt, direct, and meaningful exchanges
between interlocutors. We introduce ContingentChat, a teacher-student framework
that benchmarks and improves multi-turn contingency in a BabyLM trained on 100M
words. Using a novel alignment dataset for post-training, BabyLM generates
responses that are more grammatical and cohesive. Experiments with adaptive
teacher decoding strategies show limited additional gains. ContingentChat
demonstrates the benefits of targeted post-training for dialogue quality and
indicates that contingency remains a challenging goal for BabyLMs.

Motivation: 解决高质量指令数据稀缺而低质量数据被大量丢弃的问题，充分利用低质量数据资源来提升LLM指令对齐效果。

Method: 构建MIXTURE数据集（144K样本），提出LM-Mixup方法：先在MIXTURE上进行监督微调，然后使用GRPO强化学习优化，结合质量、语义对齐和格式合规三个奖励信号。

Result: 仅使用3%的蒸馏数据就能超越全数据集训练，在多个基准测试中与最先进的高质量数据选择方法相竞争。

Conclusion: 低质量数据经过适当蒸馏后是宝贵资源，LM-Mixup能显著提升指令调优LLM的效率和性能。

Abstract: Instruction tuning is crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs), yet
the quality of instruction-following data varies significantly. While
high-quality data is paramount, it is often scarce; conversely, abundant
low-quality data is frequently discarded, leading to substantial information
loss. Existing data augmentation methods struggle to augment this low-quality
data effectively, and the evaluation of such techniques remains poorly defined.
To address this, we formally define the task of Instruction Distillation:
distilling multiple low-quality and redundant inputs into high-quality and
coherent instruction-output pairs. Specifically, we introduce a comprehensive
data construction pipeline to create MIXTURE, a 144K-sample dataset pairing
low-quality or semantically redundant imperfect instruction clusters with their
high-quality distillations. We then introduce LM-Mixup, by first performing
supervised fine-tuning on MIXTURE and then optimizing it with reinforcement
learning. This process uses three complementary reward signals: quality,
semantic alignment, and format compliance, via Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). We demonstrate that LM-Mixup effectively augments
imperfect datasets: fine-tuning LLMs on its distilled data, which accounts for
only about 3% of the entire dataset, not only surpasses full-dataset training
but also competes with state-of-the-art high-quality data selection methods
across multiple benchmarks. Our work establishes that low-quality data is a
valuable resource when properly distilled and augmented with LM-Mixup,
significantly enhancing the efficiency and performance of instruction-tuned
LLMs.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的输出存在不同程度的不确定性和正确性，实际可靠性难以保证，需要量化这种不确定性。

Method: 在四个问答任务上使用最先进的开源LLM，系统评估了四种置信度估计方法：VCE、MSP、样本一致性和CoCoA。

Result: 每种不确定性指标捕捉了模型置信度的不同方面，混合CoCoA方法在整体可靠性方面表现最好，提高了校准和正确答案的区分度。

Conclusion: 讨论了各种方法的权衡，并为LLM应用中不确定性度量的选择提供了建议。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) produce outputs with varying levels of
uncertainty, and, just as often, varying levels of correctness; making their
practical reliability far from guaranteed. To quantify this uncertainty, we
systematically evaluate four approaches for confidence estimation in LLM
outputs: VCE, MSP, Sample Consistency, and CoCoA (Vashurin et al., 2025). For
the evaluation of the approaches, we conduct experiments on four
question-answering tasks using a state-of-the-art open-source LLM. Our results
show that each uncertainty metric captures a different facet of model
confidence and that the hybrid CoCoA approach yields the best reliability
overall, improving both calibration and discrimination of correct answers. We
discuss the trade-offs of each method and provide recommendations for selecting
uncertainty measures in LLM applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的内部表征可作为学习知识的可靠代理，但现有持续学习方法需要任务标签或面临性能权衡问题，需要一种无需历史数据、能无缝整合多领域知识的解决方案。

Method: RECALL框架：1）基于聚类典型样本的层级隐藏表征计算模型间相似度；2）自适应分层参数融合，对齐跨模型知识；3）浅层保留领域通用特征，深层进行任务特定适应。

Result: 在五个NLP任务和多种持续学习场景下的广泛实验表明，RECALL在知识保留和泛化能力方面均优于基线方法，实现了对灾难性遗忘的强大抵抗。

Conclusion: RECALL提供了一个可扩展且无需数据的解决方案，用于演进大型语言模型，实现了无缝的多领域集成和强大的抗遗忘能力。

Abstract: We unveil that internal representations in large language models (LLMs) serve
as reliable proxies of learned knowledge, and propose RECALL, a novel
representation-aware model merging framework for continual learning without
access to historical data. RECALL computes inter-model similarity from
layer-wise hidden representations over clustered typical samples, and performs
adaptive, hierarchical parameter fusion to align knowledge across models. This
design enables the preservation of domain-general features in shallow layers
while allowing task-specific adaptation in deeper layers. Unlike prior methods
that require task labels or incur performance trade-offs, RECALL achieves
seamless multi-domain integration and strong resistance to catastrophic
forgetting. Extensive experiments across five NLP tasks and multiple continual
learning scenarios show that RECALL outperforms baselines in both knowledge
retention and generalization, providing a scalable and data-free solution for
evolving LLMs.

*Tim Tian Hua,Andrew Qin,Samuel Marks,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过向LLM的激活状态添加引导向量，可以抑制模型在评估时的警觉性，使其在评估期间表现得像在部署环境中一样，从而提高安全评估的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型有时能检测到自己正在被评估，并调整行为以显得更加对齐，这会损害安全评估的可靠性。

Method: 采用两阶段训练过程：首先在包含模型事实描述的文档上进行持续预训练，然后通过专家迭代训练模型在评估设置中使用Python类型提示。最后使用原始模型的激活向量进行引导。

Result: 训练后的模型在评估环境中比部署环境中更频繁地使用类型提示，但只有在移除评估线索时才能观察到这种差异。激活引导可以抑制评估警觉性，使模型在有评估线索时也表现得像在部署中。

Conclusion: AI评估者可以通过引导模型使其在评估时表现得像在部署环境中，从而提高安全评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes detect when they are being
evaluated and adjust their behavior to appear more aligned, compromising the
reliability of safety evaluations. In this paper, we show that adding a
steering vector to an LLM's activations can suppress evaluation-awareness and
make the model act like it is deployed during evaluation. To study our steering
technique, we train an LLM to exhibit evaluation-aware behavior using a
two-step training process designed to mimic how this behavior could emerge
naturally. First, we perform continued pretraining on documents with factual
descriptions of the model (1) using Python type hints during evaluation but not
during deployment and (2) recognizing that the presence of a certain evaluation
cue always means that it is being tested. Then, we train the model with expert
iteration to use Python type hints in evaluation settings. The resulting model
is evaluation-aware: it writes type hints in evaluation contexts more than
deployment contexts. However, this gap can only be observed by removing the
evaluation cue. We find that activation steering can suppress evaluation
awareness and make the model act like it is deployed even when the cue is
present. Importantly, we constructed our steering vector using the original
model before our additional training. Our results suggest that AI evaluators
could improve the reliability of safety evaluations by steering models to act
like they are deployed.

### [44] [Robust Preference Alignment via Directional Neighborhood Consensus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20498)
*Ruochen Mao,Yuling Shi,Xiaodong Gu,Jiaheng Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Robust Preference Selection (RPS)方法，通过方向性邻域共识在无需重新训练的情况下提升大语言模型对多样化用户偏好的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要针对主流偏好进行训练，导致模型在面对偏离训练数据中心趋势的特定、个体化需求时性能下降，存在偏好覆盖差距。

Method: RPS是一种后处理、无需训练的方法，通过在相关偏好邻域内采样多个响应来创建候选池，然后选择最符合用户原始意图的响应。

Result: 在三种对齐范式(DPA、DPO、SFT)上的实验表明，RPS相比基线方法实现了高达69%的胜率，显著提升了模型在代表性不足偏好区域的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RPS提供了一个实用且理论上有依据的解决方案，能够增强偏好对齐模型的可靠性，无需模型重新训练。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human preferences is critical for
creating reliable and controllable AI systems. A human preference can be
visualized as a high-dimensional vector where different directions represent
trade-offs between desired attributes (e.g., helpfulness vs. verbosity). Yet,
because the training data often reflects dominant, average preferences, LLMs
tend to perform well on common requests but fall short in specific, individual
needs. This mismatch creates a preference coverage gap. Existing methods often
address this through costly retraining, which may not be generalized to the
full spectrum of diverse preferences. This brittleness means that when a user's
request reflects a nuanced preference deviating from the training data's
central tendency, model performance can degrade unpredictably. To address this
challenge, we introduce Robust Preference Selection (RPS), a post-hoc,
training-free method by leveraging directional neighborhood consensus. Instead
of forcing a model to generate a response from a single, highly specific
preference, RPS samples multiple responses from a local neighborhood of related
preferences to create a superior candidate pool. It then selects the response
that best aligns with the user's original intent. We provide a theoretical
framework showing our neighborhood generation strategy is provably superior to
a strong baseline that also samples multiple candidates. Comprehensive
experiments across three distinct alignment paradigms (DPA, DPO, and SFT)
demonstrate that RPS consistently improves robustness against this baseline,
achieving win rates of up to 69% on challenging preferences from
under-represented regions of the space without any model retraining. Our work
presents a practical, theoretically-grounded solution for enhancing the
reliability of preference-aligned models.

*Ruiyi Yang,Hao Xue,Imran Razzak,Hakim Hacid,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出HSEQ分层序列迭代框架，统一处理多模态证据源，通过结构化迭代实现高效准确的多步问答


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索增强生成方法在处理多步问题和异构证据源时存在脆弱性，需要在准确性、延迟和计算成本之间权衡

Method: 将文档、表格和知识图谱线性化为可逆分层序列，通过头代理和迭代代理进行结构感知的迭代检索和证据收集

Result: 在HotpotQA、HybridQA/TAT-QA和MetaQA等数据集上相比单次检索、多跳检索和智能体RAG基线获得一致的EM/F1提升

Conclusion: HSEQ框架实现了格式无关的统一处理、预算感知的高效迭代和证据规范化，显著提升了问答系统的可靠性和可审计性

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains brittle on multi-step questions
and heterogeneous evidence sources, trading accuracy against latency and
token/tool budgets. This paper introducesHierarchical Sequence (HSEQ) Iteration
for Heterogeneous Question Answering, a unified framework that (i) linearize
documents, tables, and knowledge graphs into a reversible hierarchical sequence
with lightweight structural tags, and (ii) perform structure-aware iteration to
collect just-enough evidence before answer synthesis. A Head Agent provides
guidance that leads retrieval, while an Iteration Agent selects and expands
HSeq via structure-respecting actions (e.g., parent/child hops, table
row/column neighbors, KG relations); Finally the head agent composes
canonicalized evidence to genearte the final answer, with an optional
refinement loop to resolve detected contradictions. Experiments on HotpotQA
(text), HybridQA/TAT-QA (table+text), and MetaQA (KG) show consistent EM/F1
gains over strong single-pass, multi-hop, and agentic RAG baselines with high
efficiency. Besides, HSEQ exhibits three key advantages: (1) a format-agnostic
unification that enables a single policy to operate across text, tables, and
KGs without per-dataset specialization; (2) guided, budget-aware iteration that
reduces unnecessary hops, tool calls, and tokens while preserving accuracy; and
(3) evidence canonicalization for reliable QA, improving answers consistency
and auditability.

### [46] [Assessing the Political Fairness of Multilingual LLMs: A Case Study based on a 21-way Multiparallel EuroParl Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20508)
*Paul Lerner,François Yvon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过分析欧洲议会多语言翻译质量，发现主流政党（左、中、右）的演讲翻译质量优于边缘政党，揭示了LLMs在政治翻译中的系统性偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上通过英语调查评估LLMs的政治偏见，本研究提出基于多语言翻译公平性的新框架来评估政治偏见。

Method: 使用新构建的21种语言并行EuroParl数据集，包含150万句子、4000万单词，涵盖3年数据、1000+演讲者、7个国家、12个欧盟政党等，系统比较欧洲议会演讲的翻译质量。

Result: 观察到主流政党（左翼、中间、右翼）的演讲翻译质量明显优于边缘政党，显示LLMs存在系统性政治偏见。

Conclusion: 多语言翻译质量分析为评估LLMs政治偏见提供了新视角，揭示了翻译系统对主流政党的偏好，这对公平性评估具有重要意义。

Abstract: The political biases of Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually assessed by
simulating their answers to English surveys. In this work, we propose an
alternative framing of political biases, relying on principles of fairness in
multilingual translation. We systematically compare the translation quality of
speeches in the European Parliament (EP), observing systematic differences with
majority parties from left, center, and right being better translated than
outsider parties. This study is made possible by a new, 21-way multiparallel
version of EuroParl, the parliamentary proceedings of the EP, which includes
the political affiliations of each speaker. The dataset consists of 1.5M
sentences for a total of 40M words and 249M characters. It covers three years,
1000+ speakers, 7 countries, 12 EU parties, 25 EU committees, and hundreds of
national parties.

### [47] [ARC-Encoder: learning compressed text representations for large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20535)
*Hippolyte Pilchen,Edouard Grave,Patrick Pérez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ARC-Encoder是一种上下文压缩方法，通过将文本压缩为连续表示来替换解码器LLM中的token嵌入，减少计算成本，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强生成和思维链推理等技术导致上下文变长和推理成本增加。现有上下文压缩方法需要微调目标模型或修改架构，这会降低模型的通用能力。

Method: 设计ARC-Encoder编码器，将上下文压缩为比文本token少x倍（通常x∈{4,8}）的连续表示，替代解码器LLM中的token嵌入。系统研究训练策略和架构选择。

Result: ARC-Encoder在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，同时提高推理计算效率。模型可同时适配多个解码器，实现跨LLM的泛化。

Conclusion: ARC-Encoder是灵活高效的便携式编码器解决方案，可与多个LLM无缝协作，提供状态级的上下文压缩性能。

Abstract: Recent techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation or chain-of-thought
reasoning have led to longer contexts and increased inference costs. Context
compression techniques can reduce these costs, but the most effective
approaches require fine-tuning the target model or even modifying its
architecture. This can degrade its general abilities when not used for this
specific purpose. Here we explore an alternative approach: an encoder that
compresses the context into continuous representations which replace token
embeddings in decoder LLMs. First, we perform a systematic study of training
strategies and architecture choices for the encoder. Our findings led to the
design of an Adaptable text Representations Compressor, named ARC-Encoder,
which outputs $x$-times fewer continuous representations (typically
$x\!\in\!\{4,8\}$) than text tokens. We evaluate ARC-Encoder across a variety
of LLM usage scenarios, ranging from in-context learning to context window
extension, on both instruct and base decoders. Results show that ARC-Encoder
achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks while improving
computational efficiency at inference. Finally, we demonstrate that our models
can be adapted to multiple decoders simultaneously, allowing a single encoder
to generalize across different decoder LLMs. This makes ARC-Encoder a flexible
and efficient solution for portable encoders that work seamlessly with multiple
LLMs. We release a training code at https://github.com/kyutai-labs/ARC-Encoder
, fine-tuning dataset and pretrained models are available at

### [48] [The Dog the Cat Chased Stumped the Model: Measuring When Language Models Abandon Structure for Shortcuts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20543)
*Sangmitra Madhusudan,Kaige Chen,Ali Emami*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CenterBench是一个包含9720个理解问题的数据集，用于测试语言模型在中心嵌入句上的表现，区分句法分析与语义模式匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试无法区分语言模型是真正理解句法结构还是仅依赖语义模式匹配，需要开发方法来量化这种差异。

Method: 创建包含递归嵌套关系从句的中心嵌入句数据集，每个句子都有句法相同但语义不可信的对应版本，通过6个理解问题测试表面理解、句法依赖和因果推理。

Result: 测试6个模型发现，随着复杂度增加，可信与不可信句子间的性能差距系统性扩大（中位数差距达26.8个百分点），模型在复杂情况下放弃结构分析转向语义关联。

Conclusion: CenterBench提供了首个识别模型何时从结构分析转向模式匹配的框架，语义可信性在因果推理问题上反而损害性能。

Abstract: When language models correctly parse "The cat that the dog chased meowed,"
are they analyzing syntax or simply familiar with dogs chasing cats? Despite
extensive benchmarking, we lack methods to distinguish structural understanding
from semantic pattern matching. We introduce CenterBench, a dataset of 9,720
comprehension questions on center-embedded sentences (like "The cat [that the
dog chased] meowed") where relative clauses nest recursively, creating
processing demands from simple to deeply nested structures. Each sentence has a
syntactically identical but semantically implausible counterpart (e.g., mailmen
prescribe medicine, doctors deliver mail) and six comprehension questions
testing surface understanding, syntactic dependencies, and causal reasoning.
Testing six models reveals that performance gaps between plausible and
implausible sentences widen systematically with complexity, with models showing
median gaps up to 26.8 percentage points, quantifying when they abandon
structural analysis for semantic associations. Notably, semantic plausibility
harms performance on questions about resulting actions, where following causal
relationships matters more than semantic coherence. Reasoning models improve
accuracy but their traces show semantic shortcuts, overthinking, and answer
refusal. Unlike models whose plausibility advantage systematically widens with
complexity, humans shows variable semantic effects. CenterBench provides the
first framework to identify when models shift from structural analysis to
pattern matching.

*Jinchang Luo,Mingquan Cheng,Fan Wan,Ni Li,Xiaoling Xia,Shuangshuang Tian,Tingcheng Bian,Haiwei Wang,Haohuan Fu,Yan Tao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GlobalRAG是一个强化学习框架，通过分解问题为子目标、协调检索与推理、迭代优化证据来解决多跳问答中的全局规划缺失和不可靠执行问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在多跳问答中存在两个基本限制：(i)缺乏全局规划来构建多步推理结构，(ii)不可靠执行阻碍了有效查询制定和检索证据的一致使用。

Method: 提出GlobalRAG框架，将问题分解为子目标，协调检索与推理，迭代优化证据。引入规划质量奖励和子目标完成奖励来引导过程，并使用渐进权重退火策略平衡过程导向和结果导向目标。

Result: 在领域内和领域外基准测试中，GlobalRAG显著优于强基线方法，仅使用8k训练数据（基线方法的42%），在EM和F1指标上平均提升14.2%。

Conclusion: GlobalRAG通过强化学习有效增强了多跳问答中的全局推理能力，在减少训练数据需求的同时实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently shown promise in improving
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite these advances, its effectiveness
in multi-hop question answering (QA) remains limited by two fundamental
limitations: (i) global planning absence to structure multi-step reasoning, and
(ii) unfaithful execution, which hinders effective query formulation and
consistent use of retrieved evidence. We propose GlobalRAG, a reinforcement
learning framework designed to enhance global reasoning in multi-hop QA.
GlobalRAG decomposes questions into subgoals, coordinates retrieval with
reasoning, and refines evidence iteratively. To guide this process, we
introduce Planning Quality Reward and SubGoal Completion Reward, which
encourage coherent planning and reliable subgoal execution. In addition, a
progressive weight annealing strategy balances process-oriented and
outcome-based objectives. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and
out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that GlobalRAG significantly outperforms
strong baselines while using only 8k training data (42% of the training data
used by strong baselines), achieving average improvements of 14.2% in both EM
and F1.

*Zhouwei Zhai,Mengxiang Chen,Haoyun Xia,Jin Li,Renquan Zhou,Min Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出多智能体认知决策框架(MACDF)，将电商搜索从被动检索转向主动决策支持，解决了传统检索-排序范式与用户多阶段认知决策过程不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统电商搜索的检索-排序范式依赖于查询-商品匹配，与平台用户的多阶段认知决策过程存在根本性不匹配，导致语义鸿沟、高决策成本和缺乏专业购物指导等问题。

Method: 提出多智能体认知决策框架(MACDF)，通过多智能体系统主动提供决策支持，而非被动检索。

Result: 离线评估显示MACDF在推荐准确性和用户满意度方面显著提升，特别是在涉及否定、多约束或推理需求的复杂查询中。在JD搜索平台的在线A/B测试证实了其实际效果。

Conclusion: 这项工作凸显了多智能体认知系统在重新定义电商搜索方面的变革潜力，从被动检索转向主动决策支持。

Abstract: The retrieval-ranking paradigm has long dominated e-commerce search, but its
reliance on query-item matching fundamentally misaligns with multi-stage
cognitive decision processes of platform users. This misalignment introduces
critical limitations: semantic gaps in complex queries, high decision costs due
to cross-platform information foraging, and the absence of professional
shopping guidance. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Agent Cognitive
Decision Framework (MACDF), which shifts the paradigm from passive retrieval to
proactive decision support. Extensive offline evaluations demonstrate MACDF's
significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction,
particularly for complex queries involving negation, multi-constraint, or
reasoning demands. Online A/B testing on JD search platform confirms its
practical efficacy. This work highlights the transformative potential of
multi-agent cognitive systems in redefining e-commerce search.

TL;DR: 研究评估了ChatGPT在通信数据自动编码中是否存在性别和种族偏见，发现无明显偏见，支持其在大规模协作评估中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明ChatGPT能按编码框架自动编码通信数据，但尚不清楚其编码是否存在对性别和种族等人口群体的偏见。

Method: 使用典型的协作问题解决编码框架，分析ChatGPT对三类协作任务（谈判、问题解决、决策制定）通信数据的自动编码。

Result: ChatGPT的自动编码在性别和种族群体间未表现出显著偏见。

Conclusion: ChatGPT的自动编码无显著人口偏见，为大规模协作和通信评估的应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Assessing communication and collaboration at scale depends on a labor
intensive task of coding communication data into categories according to
different frameworks. Prior research has established that ChatGPT can be
directly instructed with coding rubrics to code the communication data and
achieves accuracy comparable to human raters. However, whether the coding from
ChatGPT or similar AI technology exhibits bias against different demographic
groups, such as gender and race, remains unclear. To fill this gap, this paper
investigates ChatGPT-based automated coding of communication data using a
typical coding framework for collaborative problem solving, examining
differences across gender and racial groups. The analysis draws on data from
three types of collaborative tasks: negotiation, problem solving, and decision
making. Our results show that ChatGPT-based coding exhibits no significant bias
across gender and racial groups, paving the road for its adoption in
large-scale assessment of collaboration and communication.

TL;DR: 该论文基于人类好奇心评估问卷5DCR设计了一个评估框架，用于评估大语言模型的好奇心程度，发现LLMs比人类有更强的知识渴求，但在不确定环境中仍趋于保守选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型是否具备类似人类的好奇心驱动学习能力，这是理解LLMs认知能力的重要方面。

Method: 从人类好奇心评估问卷Five-Dimensional Curiosity scale Revised (5DCR)出发，设计了一个涵盖信息寻求、刺激寻求和社会好奇心等维度的综合评估框架。

Result: LLMs表现出比人类更强的知识渴求，但在面对不确定环境时仍倾向于做出保守选择。好奇心行为能够增强模型的推理和主动学习能力。

Conclusion: LLMs有潜力表现出类似人类的好奇心，这为未来LLMs学习能力和创新研究的发展提供了实验支持。

Abstract: Curiosity serves as a pivotal conduit for human beings to discover and learn
new knowledge. Recent advancements of large language models (LLMs) in natural
language processing have sparked discussions regarding whether these models
possess capability of curiosity-driven learning akin to humans. In this paper,
starting from the human curiosity assessment questionnaire Five-Dimensional
Curiosity scale Revised (5DCR), we design a comprehensive evaluation framework
that covers dimensions such as Information Seeking, Thrill Seeking, and Social
Curiosity to assess the extent of curiosity exhibited by LLMs. The results
demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a stronger thirst for knowledge than humans but
still tend to make conservative choices when faced with uncertain environments.
We further investigated the relationship between curiosity and thinking of
LLMs, confirming that curious behaviors can enhance the model's reasoning and
active learning abilities. These findings suggest that LLMs have the potential
to exhibit curiosity similar to that of humans, providing experimental support
for the future development of learning capabilities and innovative research in
LLMs.

TL;DR: LRMs在非英语问题上倾向于使用英语推理，导致认知行为减少和准确率下降，特别是在复杂任务中，但英语推理策略存在翻译错误风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型推理模型的多语言推理能力，关注其在非英语问题中默认使用英语推理的问题，以及这对处理语言和文化细微差别的影响。

Method: 系统比较LRM在英语与问题语言中的推理表现，评估MGSM和GPQA Diamond两个任务，分析推理轨迹中的认知属性。

Result: 英语推理轨迹显示出更高的认知行为存在，且英语推理通常带来更高的最终答案准确率，但随着任务复杂度增加，性能差距扩大。英语中心策略易受翻译错误影响。

Conclusion: LRMs在非英语问题上过度依赖英语推理，虽然能提高准确率但存在翻译错误风险，需要改进多语言推理能力以更好地处理语言和文化差异。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance on mathematical,
scientific, and other question-answering tasks, but their multilingual
reasoning abilities remain underexplored. When presented with non-English
questions, LRMs often default to reasoning in English, raising concerns about
interpretability and the handling of linguistic and cultural nuances. We
systematically compare an LRM's reasoning in English versus the language of the
question. Our evaluation spans two tasks: MGSM and GPQA Diamond. Beyond
measuring answer accuracy, we also analyze cognitive attributes in the
reasoning traces. We find that English reasoning traces exhibit a substantially
higher presence of these cognitive behaviors, and that reasoning in English
generally yields higher final-answer accuracy, with the performance gap
increasing as tasks become more complex. However, this English-centric strategy
is susceptible to a key failure mode - getting "Lost in Translation," where
translation steps lead to errors that would have been avoided by question's
language reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 粤语虽然有数百万使用者，但由于政策和双语现象，资源匮乏，缺乏评估框架。

Method: 创建CantoNLU基准测试，包含7个任务：词义消歧、语言可接受性判断、语言检测、自然语言推理、情感分析、词性标注和依存句法分析。评估了四种模型：未经粤语训练的普通话模型、通过持续预训练获得的粤语适应模型、从头训练的粤语单语模型。

Result: 粤语适应模型整体表现最佳，单语模型在句法任务上表现更好。普通话模型在某些场景下仍具竞争力，表明当粤语领域数据稀缺时，直接迁移可能足够。

Conclusion: 发布了所有数据集、代码和模型权重，以促进粤语NLP的未来研究。

Abstract: Cantonese, although spoken by millions, remains under-resourced due to policy
and diglossia. To address this scarcity of evaluation frameworks for Cantonese,
we introduce \textsc{\textbf{CantoNLU}}, a benchmark for Cantonese natural
language understanding (NLU). This novel benchmark spans seven tasks covering
syntax and semantics, including word sense disambiguation, linguistic
acceptability judgment, language detection, natural language inference,
sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing. In addition
to the benchmark, we provide model baseline performance across a set of models:
a Mandarin model without Cantonese training, two Cantonese-adapted models
obtained by continual pre-training a Mandarin model on Cantonese text, and a
monolingual Cantonese model trained from scratch. Results show that
Cantonese-adapted models perform best overall, while monolingual models perform
better on syntactic tasks. Mandarin models remain competitive in certain
settings, indicating that direct transfer may be sufficient when Cantonese
domain data is scarce. We release all datasets, code, and model weights to
facilitate future research in Cantonese NLP.

TL;DR: 提出神经多样性作为减少语言模型幻觉的新机制，通过神经去相关并行表示来降低幻觉率，而不增加参数或数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管参数、计算和数据不断增加，语言模型仍然存在幻觉问题。需要找到在固定预算下减少幻觉的新方法。

Method: 提出ND-LoRA（神经多样性低秩适应），结合并行LoRA适配器和Barlow Twins正则化，通过降低表示相关性来减少幻觉。

Result: ND-LoRA将幻觉减少高达25.6%（平均14.6%），且不降低一般准确性。神经相关性增加0.1%与幻觉增加3.8%相关。

Conclusion: 神经多样性是继参数和数据之后的第三个扩展维度，可在固定预算下提高语言模型的可靠性。

Abstract: Language models continue to hallucinate despite increases in parameters,
compute, and data. We propose neural diversity -- decorrelated parallel
representations -- as a principled mechanism that reduces hallucination rates
at fixed parameter and data budgets. Inspired by portfolio theory, where
uncorrelated assets reduce risk by $\sqrt{P}$, we prove hallucination
probability is bounded by representational correlation: $P(H) \leq
f(\sigma^2((1-\rho(P))/P + \rho(P)), \mu^2)$, which predicts that language
models need an optimal amount of neurodiversity. To validate this, we introduce
ND-LoRA (Neural Diversity Low-Rank Adaptation), combining parallel LoRA
adapters with Barlow Twins regularization, and demonstrate that ND-LoRA reduces
hallucinations by up to 25.6% (and 14.6% on average) without degrading general
accuracy. Ablations show LoRA adapters and regularization act synergistically,
causal interventions prove neurodiversity as the mediating factor and
correlational analyses indicate scale: a 0.1% neural correlation increase is
associated with a 3.8% hallucination increase. Finally, task-dependent
optimality emerges: different tasks require different amounts of optimal
neurodiversity. Together, our results highlight neural diversity as a third
axis of scaling -- orthogonal to parameters and data -- to improve the
reliability of language models at fixed budgets.

Result: 实验表明标准相似性函数在结构最优性上表现不佳，而提出的改进方法显著提升了结构最优性，在真实指令跟随基准测试中生成质量提升了13.7个百分点。

Conclusion: 增强MBR对结构变化的敏感性可以有效提升在开放任务中的生成质量，提出的轻量级改进方法具有实用价值。

Abstract: Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding has seen renewed interest as an alternative
to traditional generation strategies. While MBR has proven effective in machine
translation, where the variability of a language model's outcome space is
naturally constrained, it may face challenges in more open-ended tasks such as
dialogue or instruction-following. We hypothesise that in such settings,
applying MBR with standard similarity-based utility functions may result in
selecting responses that are broadly representative of the model's
distribution, yet sub-optimal with respect to any particular grouping of
generations that share an underlying latent structure. In this work, we
introduce three lightweight adaptations to the utility function, designed to
make MBR more sensitive to structural variability in the outcome space. To test
our hypothesis, we curate a dataset capturing three representative types of
latent structure: dialogue act, emotion, and response structure (e.g., a
sentence, a paragraph, or a list). We further propose two metrics to evaluate
the structural optimality of MBR. Our analysis demonstrates that common
similarity-based utility functions fall short by these metrics. In contrast,
our proposed adaptations considerably improve structural optimality. Finally,
we evaluate our approaches on real-world instruction-following benchmarks,
AlpacaEval and MT-Bench, and show that increased structural sensitivity
improves generation quality by up to 13.7 percentage points in win rate.

### [58] [User Perceptions of Privacy and Helpfulness in LLM Responses to Privacy-Sensitive Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20721)
*Xiaoyuan Wu,Roshni Kaushik,Wenkai Li,Lujo Bauer,Koichi Onoue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过用户研究发现，在隐私敏感场景中，用户对LLM响应的隐私保护质量和帮助性评价存在很大个体差异，而代理LLM与用户评价相关性很低，表明需要用户中心的研究方法来评估LLM的隐私保护能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究使用代理LLM评估隐私保护能力，但忽略了真实用户的感知差异，且主要关注隐私保护质量而忽略了帮助性的细微差异。

Method: 对94名参与者进行了用户研究，使用PrivacyLens中的90个场景，比较用户与5个代理LLM对LLM响应的隐私保护质量和帮助性评价。

Result: 用户对相同响应的隐私保护质量和帮助性评价一致性很低，而代理LLM之间一致性很高，但与用户评价相关性很低。

Conclusion: 隐私和帮助性是高度个体化的，代理LLM无法准确估计用户感知，需要用户中心的研究方法和改进代理LLM与用户的对齐。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid adoption for tasks such as
drafting emails, summarizing meetings, and answering health questions. In such
uses, users may need to share private information (e.g., health records,
contact details). To evaluate LLMs' ability to identify and redact such private
information, prior work developed benchmarks (e.g., ConfAIde, PrivacyLens) with
real-life scenarios. Using these benchmarks, researchers have found that LLMs
sometimes fail to keep secrets private when responding to complex tasks (e.g.,
leaking employee salaries in meeting summaries). However, these evaluations
rely on LLMs (proxy LLMs) to gauge compliance with privacy norms, overlooking
real users' perceptions. Moreover, prior work primarily focused on the
privacy-preservation quality of responses, without investigating nuanced
differences in helpfulness. To understand how users perceive the
privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of LLM responses to
privacy-sensitive scenarios, we conducted a user study with 94 participants
using 90 scenarios from PrivacyLens. We found that, when evaluating identical
responses to the same scenario, users showed low agreement with each other on
the privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of the LLM response. Further,
we found high agreement among five proxy LLMs, while each individual LLM had
low correlation with users' evaluations. These results indicate that the
privacy and helpfulness of LLM responses are often specific to individuals, and
proxy LLMs are poor estimates of how real users would perceive these responses
in privacy-sensitive scenarios. Our results suggest the need to conduct
user-centered studies on measuring LLMs' ability to help users while preserving
privacy. Additionally, future research could investigate ways to improve the
alignment between proxy LLMs and users for better estimation of users'
perceived privacy and utility.

*Xizhi Wu,Madeline S. Kreider,Philip E. Empey,Chenyu Li,Yanshan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究开发并评估了多种NLP方法，用于从临床笔记中提取氟嘧啶类药物治疗和毒性信息。基于大语言模型的错误分析提示方法表现最佳，F1分数达到1.000。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 氟嘧啶类药物广泛用于结直肠癌和乳腺癌治疗，但会引发手足综合征和心脏毒性等不良反应。由于毒性信息通常嵌入在临床笔记中，需要开发有效的NLP方法来提取这些信息。

Method: 构建了包含236份临床笔记的金标准数据集，开发了基于规则、机器学习（随机森林、SVM、逻辑回归）、深度学习（BERT、ClinicalBERT）和大语言模型（零样本提示和错误分析提示）的NLP方法，使用80:20的训练测试分割。

Result: 错误分析提示方法在治疗和毒性提取方面达到最优性能（F1=1.000），零样本提示在治疗提取上F1=1.000，毒性提取F1=0.876。逻辑回归和SVM在毒性提取上排名第二（F1=0.937）。深度学习方法表现较差。

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的NLP方法最有效地从临床笔记中提取氟嘧啶类药物治疗和毒性信息，在肿瘤学研究和药物警戒方面具有强大潜力。

Abstract: Objective: Fluoropyrimidines are widely prescribed for colorectal and breast
cancers, but are associated with toxicities such as hand-foot syndrome and
cardiotoxicity. Since toxicity documentation is often embedded in clinical
notes, we aimed to develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP)
methods to extract treatment and toxicity information.
  Materials and Methods: We constructed a gold-standard dataset of 236 clinical
notes from 204,165 adult oncology patients. Domain experts annotated categories
related to treatment regimens and toxicities. We developed rule-based, machine
learning-based (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine [SVM], Logistic
Regression [LR]), deep learning-based (BERT, ClinicalBERT), and large language
models (LLM)-based NLP approaches (zero-shot and error-analysis prompting).
Models used an 80:20 train-test split.
  Results: Sufficient data existed to train and evaluate 5 annotated
categories. Error-analysis prompting achieved optimal precision, recall, and F1
scores (F1=1.000) for treatment and toxicities extraction, whereas zero-shot
prompting reached F1=1.000 for treatment and F1=0.876 for toxicities
extraction.LR and SVM ranked second for toxicities (F1=0.937). Deep learning
underperformed, with BERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1= 0.839 toxicities) and
ClinicalBERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1 = 0.886 toxicities). Rule-based methods
served as our baseline with F1 scores of 0.857 in treatment and 0.858 in
toxicities.
  Discussion: LMM-based approaches outperformed all others, followed by machine
learning methods. Machine and deep learning approaches were limited by small
training data and showed limited generalizability, particularly for rare
categories.
  Conclusion: LLM-based NLP most effectively extracted fluoropyrimidine
treatment and toxicity information from clinical notes, and has strong
potential to support oncology research and pharmacovigilance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文首次系统分析了大型推理模型作为机器翻译评估器的潜力，发现其存在评估材料需求特殊、对简单实例过度思考以及评分机制导致高估等问题，提出通过训练合成的人类思维轨迹来校准模型思维，显著降低了思考成本并提升了评估性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂任务中通过中间思考过程提升了推理能力，但其在机器翻译质量评估方面的潜力尚未充分探索，需要系统分析其作为评估器的可行性。

Method: 提出校准大型推理模型思维的方法，通过训练模型学习合成的、类似人类的思维轨迹，以解决过度思考和评分机制问题。

Result: 在WMT24 Metrics基准测试中，该方法将思考预算降低了约35倍，同时在不同规模模型（7B到32B）上提升了评估性能，例如R1-Distill-Qwen-7B模型的相关性提高了8.7个百分点。

Conclusion: 有效校准的大型推理模型有潜力推进细粒度自动机器翻译评估的发展，展示了在降低计算成本的同时提升评估准确性的可行性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have introduced an
intermediate "thinking" process prior to generating final answers, improving
their reasoning capabilities on complex downstream tasks. However, the
potential of LRMs as evaluators for machine translation (MT) quality remains
underexplored. We provides the first systematic analysis of LRM-as-a-judge in
MT evaluation. We identify key challenges, revealing LRMs require tailored
evaluation materials, tend to "overthink" simpler instances and have issues
with scoring mechanisms leading to overestimation. To address these, we propose
to calibrate LRM thinking by training them on synthetic, human-like thinking
trajectories. Our experiments on WMT24 Metrics benchmarks demonstrate that this
approach largely reduces thinking budgets by ~35x while concurrently improving
evaluation performance across different LRM scales from 7B to 32B (e.g.,
R1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves a +8.7 correlation point improvement). These
findings highlight the potential of efficiently calibrated LRMs to advance
fine-grained automatic MT evaluation.

TL;DR: 该论文构建了一个基于真实应用场景的数据集，用于评估大语言模型在负责任AI维度（特别是公平性）上的表现，提出了结合公平属性、性别化形容词和产品类别的评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估大语言模型的方法主要关注高层次任务如文本生成，没有针对特定AI应用，这在评估负责任AI维度（如公平性）时不够充分，因为不同应用中受保护属性的相关性不同。

Method: 构建了一个基于真实应用场景（根据产品特征生成纯文本产品描述）的数据集，参数化地结合了公平属性、性别化形容词和产品类别，创建了一套带标签的提示集。

Result: 展示了如何使用该数据集识别大语言模型在质量、真实性、安全性和公平性方面的差距。

Conclusion: 为研究社区贡献了LLM评估方案和具体资源，推动负责任AI评估的发展。

Abstract: Current methods for evaluating large language models (LLMs) typically focus
on high-level tasks such as text generation, without targeting a particular AI
application. This approach is not sufficient for evaluating LLMs for
Responsible AI dimensions like fairness, since protected attributes that are
highly relevant in one application may be less relevant in another. In this
work, we construct a dataset that is driven by a real-world application
(generate a plain-text product description, given a list of product features),
parameterized by fairness attributes intersected with gendered adjectives and
product categories, yielding a rich set of labeled prompts. We show how to use
the data to identify quality, veracity, safety, and fairness gaps in LLMs,
contributing a proposal for LLM evaluation paired with a concrete resource for
the research community.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合注意力模型，在线性注意力基础上引入稀疏注意力机制，通过可学习的token淘汰策略和滑动窗口注意力，在保持线性复杂度同时提升检索密集型任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性注意力模型虽然高效，但有限的记忆容量会导致遗忘问题，特别是在检索密集型任务中表现不佳。需要找到在保持效率的同时增强记忆能力的方法。

Method: 混合模型方法：1）可学习的token淘汰策略，使用轻量级CNN聚合相邻token信息来自适应保留关键KV对；2）结合滑动窗口注意力；3）提供高效的Triton内核实现稀疏注意力机制。

Result: 在检索密集型基准测试中验证了方法的有效性，能够在保持线性注意力常数时间/空间复杂度的同时提升性能。

Conclusion: 通过引入稀疏注意力机制和可学习的token淘汰策略，成功解决了线性注意力模型的遗忘问题，为检索密集型任务提供了高效且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Linear-attention models that compress the entire input sequence into a
fixed-size recurrent state offer an efficient alternative to Transformers, but
their finite memory induces forgetfulness that harms retrieval-intensive tasks.
To mitigate the issue, we explore a series of hybrid models that restore direct
access to past tokens. We interleave token mixers with intermediate time and
space complexity between linear and full attention, including sparse attention
with token eviction, and the query-aware native sparse attention. Particularly,
we propose a novel learnable token eviction approach. Combined with
sliding-window attention, an end-to-end trainable lightweight CNN aggregates
information from both past and future adjacent tokens to adaptively retain a
limited set of critical KV-pairs per head, maintaining linear attention's
constant time and space complexity. Efficient Triton kernels for the sparse
attention mechanisms are provided. Empirical evaluations on retrieval-intensive
benchmarks support the effectiveness of our approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低在检索增强生成中使用长上下文的计算成本，通过将输入序列转换为更短的连续表示来实现软上下文压缩。

Method: 开发了轻量级简单的均值池化方法，并与广泛使用的压缩令牌架构进行比较，同时训练同一压缩器输出多种压缩比。

Result: 简单的均值池化方法在所有实验中都表现出最强的性能，在训练多种压缩比时性能下降相对较小。

Conclusion: 均值池化方法是最有效的压缩方法，但不同架构和训练机制之间的权衡更为复杂，显示了压缩方法领域的复杂性。

Abstract: A common strategy to reduce the computational costs of using long contexts in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) is soft
context compression, where the input sequence is transformed into a shorter
continuous representation. We develop a lightweight and simple mean-pooling
approach that consistently outperforms the widely used compression-tokens
architecture, and study training the same compressor to output multiple
compression ratios. We conduct extensive experiments across in-domain and
out-of-domain QA datasets, as well as across model families, scales, and
compression ratios. Overall, our simple mean-pooling approach achieves the
strongest performance, with a relatively small drop when training for multiple
compression ratios. More broadly though, across architectures and training
regimes the trade-offs are more nuanced, illustrating the complex landscape of
compression methods.

TL;DR: 论文指出当前LLM生成文本检测面临定义模糊、检测目标不明确、现实应用条件复杂等问题，导致检测结果容易被误解，应谨慎参考而非作为决定性指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛应用，检测AI生成文本的需求日益增长，但现有检测方法缺乏对"LLM生成文本"的统一定义，且现实使用场景的复杂性使检测变得困难。

Method: 论文通过分析现有检测方法的局限性，指出人类编辑LLM输出、LLM对用户的微妙影响等因素模糊了AI生成与人类写作的界限。

Result: 现有基准和评估方法未能充分覆盖真实世界检测应用的各种条件，导致检测器的数值结果经常被误解，其重要性正在减弱。

Conclusion: 检测器在特定条件下仍然有用，但其结果应仅作为参考而非决定性指标，需要更谨慎地解释检测结果。

Abstract: With the widespread use of large language models (LLMs), many researchers
have turned their attention to detecting text generated by them. However, there
is no consistent or precise definition of their target, namely "LLM-generated
text". Differences in usage scenarios and the diversity of LLMs further
increase the difficulty of detection. What is commonly regarded as the
detecting target usually represents only a subset of the text that LLMs can
potentially produce. Human edits to LLM outputs, together with the subtle
influences that LLMs exert on their users, are blurring the line between
LLM-generated and human-written text. Existing benchmarks and evaluation
approaches do not adequately address the various conditions in real-world
detector applications. Hence, the numerical results of detectors are often
misunderstood, and their significance is diminishing. Therefore, detectors
remain useful under specific conditions, but their results should be
interpreted only as references rather than decisive indicators.

Motivation: GAN生成的逼真图像对图像取证和工业系统的内容真实性构成严重挑战，需要可靠的方法来区分真实与合成图像。

Method: 应用二维离散傅里叶变换将图像转换到傅里叶域，利用ResNet50神经网络在频域图像上进行训练，检测GAN图像的周期性伪影。

Result: 频域模型达到92.8%的准确率和0.95的AUC值，显著优于在原始空间域图像上训练的同等模型。

Conclusion: GAN生成的图像具有独特的频域特征，结合信号处理和深度学习的方法在数字取证和工业AI系统可信度方面具有重要潜力。

Abstract: The rapid rise of photorealistic images produced from Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) poses a serious challenge for image forensics and industrial
systems requiring reliable content authenticity. This paper uses
frequency-domain analysis combined with deep learning to solve the problem of
distinguishing StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Specifically, a
two-dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform (2D DFT) was applied to transform
images into the Fourier domain, where subtle periodic artifacts become
detectable. A ResNet50 neural network is trained on these transformed images to
differentiate between real and synthetic ones. The experiments demonstrate that
the frequency-domain model achieves a 92.8 percent and an AUC of 0.95,
significantly outperforming the equivalent model trained on raw spatial-domain
images. These results indicate that the GAN-generated images have unique
frequency-domain signatures or "fingerprints". The method proposed highlights
the industrial potential of combining signal processing techniques and deep
learning to enhance digital forensics and strengthen the trustworthiness of
industrial AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机视觉方法在从2D图像识别3D物体时面临挑战，通常需要大量标注数据，且CNN可能忽略关键的形状关系。

Method: 采用Vision Transformers架构与现代对比学习目标（包括监督和自监督对比损失）相结合，进行多视角3D分析。

Result: 在ModelNet10上，监督对比损失达到约90.6%的准确率，验证了ViT与对比学习结合在3D表示学习中的有效性。

Conclusion: ViT通过捕捉全局形状语义，结合对比学习优化局部判别特征，成功克服了传统方法的局限性，为3D形状理解提供了统一框架。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges in representation learning of 3D shape
features by investigating state-of-the-art backbones paired with both
contrastive supervised and self-supervised learning objectives. Computer vision
methods struggle with recognizing 3D objects from 2D images, often requiring
extensive labeled data and relying on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that
may overlook crucial shape relationships. Our work demonstrates that Vision
Transformers (ViTs) based architectures, when paired with modern contrastive
objectives, achieve promising results in multi-view 3D analysis on our
downstream tasks, unifying contrastive and 3D shape understanding pipelines.
For example, supervised contrastive losses reached about 90.6% accuracy on
ModelNet10. The use of ViTs and contrastive learning, leveraging ViTs' ability
to understand overall shapes and contrastive learning's effectiveness,
overcomes the need for extensive labeled data and the limitations of CNNs in
capturing crucial shape relationships. The success stems from capturing global
shape semantics via ViTs and refining local discriminative features through
contrastive optimization. Importantly, our approach is empirical, as it is
grounded on extensive experimental evaluation to validate the effectiveness of
combining ViTs with contrastive objectives for 3D representation learning.

Motivation: 现有的单传感器跟踪方法在多模态传感器特征利用方面存在不足，需要开发能够有效融合相机和LiDAR数据的跟踪框架，以在遮挡和视角变化下实现鲁棒的重新识别。

Method: 采用基于查询的跟踪框架，包含多模态两阶段transformer精炼和跟踪流程。融合跟踪器将边界框与多相机和LiDAR的多模态BEV融合特征集成，无需显式运动模型。跟踪前使用时间平滑器在移动窗口上精炼边界框序列。

Result: 在nuScenes和KITTI数据集上的评估表明，与之前的单传感器方法相比，基于查询的transformer跟踪方法从多模态传感器特征中获益显著。在nuScenes测试集上aMOTA达到74.7，减少了身份切换。

Conclusion: FutrTrack提供了一个高效框架，用于改进基于transformer的跟踪器，使其即使在有限数据和无预训练的情况下也能与其他基于神经网络的方法竞争。

Abstract: We propose FutrTrack, a modular camera-LiDAR multi-object tracking framework
that builds on existing 3D detectors by introducing a transformer-based
smoother and a fusion-driven tracker. Inspired by query-based tracking
frameworks, FutrTrack employs a multimodal two-stage transformer refinement and
tracking pipeline. Our fusion tracker integrates bounding boxes with multimodal
bird's-eye-view (BEV) fusion features from multiple cameras and LiDAR without
the need for an explicit motion model. The tracker assigns and propagates
identities across frames, leveraging both geometric and semantic cues for
robust re-identification under occlusion and viewpoint changes. Prior to
tracking, we refine sequences of bounding boxes with a temporal smoother over a
moving window to refine trajectories, reduce jitter, and improve spatial
consistency. Evaluated on nuScenes and KITTI, FutrTrack demonstrates that
query-based transformer tracking methods benefit significantly from multimodal
sensor features compared with previous single-sensor approaches. With an aMOTA
of 74.7 on the nuScenes test set, FutrTrack achieves strong performance on 3D
MOT benchmarks, reducing identity switches while maintaining competitive
accuracy. Our approach provides an efficient framework for improving
transformer-based trackers to compete with other neural-network-based methods
even with limited data and without pretraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在医学图像分类中常产生过度自信的预测，传统标签平滑方法不考虑类别间关系，需要更智能的解决方案

Method: 使用在线标签平滑(OLS)方法，在训练过程中基于模型自身预测模式动态调整软标签，在RadImageNet数据集上评估了ResNet-50、MobileNetV2和VGG-19三种架构

Result: OLS在Top-1和Top-5分类准确率上均优于标准训练方法，包括硬标签、传统标签平滑和教师无知识蒸馏，同时产生了更紧凑和分离良好的特征嵌入

Conclusion: OLS不仅增强了预测性能，还提高了校准度，是医学影像领域开发可信AI系统的实用有效解决方案

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks, have achieved
impressive results in medical image classification. However, these models often
produce overconfident predictions, which can undermine their reliability in
critical healthcare settings. While traditional label smoothing offers a simple
way to reduce such overconfidence, it fails to consider relationships between
classes by treating all non-target classes equally. In this study, we explore
the use of Online Label Smoothing (OLS), a dynamic approach that adjusts soft
labels throughout training based on the model's own prediction patterns. We
evaluate OLS on the large-scale RadImageNet dataset using three widely used
architectures: ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19. Our results show that OLS
consistently improves both Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy compared to
standard training methods, including hard labels, conventional label smoothing,
and teacher-free knowledge distillation. In addition to accuracy gains, OLS
leads to more compact and well-separated feature embeddings, indicating
improved representation learning. These findings suggest that OLS not only
strengthens predictive performance but also enhances calibration, making it a
practical and effective solution for developing trustworthy AI systems in the
medical imaging domain.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了鱼眼图像固有的问题，证明了其在鱼眼图像处理中的有效性。

Abstract: Fisheye cameras offer an efficient solution for wide-area traffic
surveillance by capturing large fields of view from a single vantage point.
However, the strong radial distortion and nonuniform resolution inherent in
fisheye imagery introduce substantial challenges for standard object detectors,
particularly near image boundaries where object appearance is severely
degraded. In this work, we present a detection framework designed to operate
robustly under these conditions. Our approach employs a simple yet effective
pre and post processing pipeline that enhances detection consistency across the
image, especially in regions affected by severe distortion. We train several
state-of-the-art detection models on the fisheye traffic imagery and combine
their outputs through an ensemble strategy to improve overall detection
accuracy. Our method achieves an F1 score of0.6366 on the 2025 AI City
Challenge Track 4, placing 8thoverall out of 62 teams. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in addressing issues inherent to
fisheye imagery.

TL;DR: 提出了一种实时渲染感知过滤方法，解决3D高斯溅射模型在训练数据分布外视角观察时的视觉噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS模型在训练数据分布外的视角观察时会产生严重的视觉噪声，这是由于缺乏这些外推区域的训练数据导致模型预测不确定性增加。

Method: 利用中间梯度导出的敏感度分数，专门针对各向异性方向引起的不稳定性进行过滤，而非各向同性方差。

Result: 实验评估表明，该方法相比现有NeRF方法（如BayesRays）显著提高了视觉质量、真实感和一致性。

Conclusion: 该过滤方法能无缝集成到现有3DGS渲染管道中实时运行，无需大量事后重新训练或微调，使3D重建系统在用户自由导航到原始训练视角外时仍能保持高视觉保真度。

Abstract: When viewing a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from camera positions
significantly outside the training data distribution, substantial visual noise
commonly occurs. These artifacts result from the lack of training data in these
extrapolated regions, leading to uncertain density, color, and geometry
predictions from the model.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel real-time render-aware filtering
method. Our approach leverages sensitivity scores derived from intermediate
gradients, explicitly targeting instabilities caused by anisotropic
orientations rather than isotropic variance. This filtering method directly
addresses the core issue of generative uncertainty, allowing 3D reconstruction
systems to maintain high visual fidelity even when users freely navigate
outside the original training viewpoints.
  Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method substantially improves
visual quality, realism, and consistency compared to existing Neural Radiance

Motivation: 传统物理方法受颅骨衰减和稀疏孔径限制，纯数据驱动方法在复杂波传播建模上存在定量偏差，需要结合两者优势解决脑部超声成像挑战。

Method: 两阶段混合框架：第一阶段使用逆时偏移处理多角度采集数据生成迁移片段；第二阶段使用基于transformer的超分辨率编码器-解码器融合片段生成准确声速图像。

Result: 在两个合成数据集上的实验表明，BrainPuzzle在声速重建精度和图像完整性方面优于其他方法。

Conclusion: BrainPuzzle展示了在定量超声脑成像领域的潜力，通过混合方法克服了传统物理方法和纯数据驱动方法的局限性。

Abstract: Ultrasound brain imaging remains challenging due to the large difference in
sound speed between the skull and brain tissues and the difficulty of coupling
large probes to the skull. This work aims to achieve quantitative transcranial
ultrasound by reconstructing an accurate speed-of-sound (SoS) map of the brain.
Traditional physics-based full-waveform inversion (FWI) is limited by weak
signals caused by skull-induced attenuation, mode conversion, and phase
aberration, as well as incomplete spatial coverage since full-aperture arrays
are clinically impractical. In contrast, purely data-driven methods that learn
directly from raw ultrasound data often fail to model the complex nonlinear and
nonlocal wave propagation through bone, leading to anatomically plausible but
quantitatively biased SoS maps under low signal-to-noise and sparse-aperture
conditions. To address these issues, we propose BrainPuzzle, a hybrid two-stage
framework that combines physical modeling with machine learning. In the first
stage, reverse time migration (time-reversal acoustics) is applied to
multi-angle acquisitions to produce migration fragments that preserve
structural details even under low SNR. In the second stage, a transformer-based
super-resolution encoder-decoder with a graph-based attention unit (GAU) fuses
these fragments into a coherent and quantitatively accurate SoS image. A
partial-array acquisition strategy using a movable low-count transducer set
improves feasibility and coupling, while the hybrid algorithm compensates for
the missing aperture. Experiments on two synthetic datasets show that
BrainPuzzle achieves superior SoS reconstruction accuracy and image
completeness, demonstrating its potential for advancing quantitative ultrasound
brain imaging.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个统一评估框架，用于分析生成式图像模型中的文化偏见，发现模型倾向于默认使用全球北方现代风格，I2I编辑会侵蚀文化保真度，且当前系统无法进行文化敏感的编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注文本到图像系统的文化偏见，而图像到图像编辑器的文化偏见研究不足，需要建立一个标准化协议来比较诊断不同模型的文化偏见。

Method: 使用开放模型和固定设置，在六个国家进行跨国家、跨时代、跨类别评估，结合标准自动指标、文化感知检索增强VQA和本地评审专家的判断。

Result: 研究发现：1）国家无关提示下模型默认全球北方现代风格；2）迭代I2I编辑会侵蚀文化保真度；3）I2I模型仅应用表面线索而非情境感知变化。

Conclusion: 当前系统的文化敏感编辑不可靠，通过发布标准化数据和评估协议，为诊断和追踪生成式图像模型的文化偏见提供了可复现的文化中心基准。

Abstract: Generative image models produce striking visuals yet often misrepresent
culture. Prior work has examined cultural bias mainly in text-to-image (T2I)
systems, leaving image-to-image (I2I) editors underexplored. We bridge this gap
with a unified evaluation across six countries, an 8-category/36-subcategory
schema, and era-aware prompts, auditing both T2I generation and I2I editing
under a standardized protocol that yields comparable diagnostics. Using open
models with fixed settings, we derive cross-country, cross-era, and
cross-category evaluations. Our framework combines standard automatic metrics,
a culture-aware retrieval-augmented VQA, and expert human judgments collected
from native reviewers. To enable reproducibility, we release the complete image
corpus, prompts, and configurations. Our study reveals three findings: (1)
under country-agnostic prompts, models default to Global-North, modern-leaning
depictions that flatten cross-country distinctions; (2) iterative I2I editing
erodes cultural fidelity even when conventional metrics remain flat or improve;
and (3) I2I models apply superficial cues (palette shifts, generic props)
rather than era-consistent, context-aware changes, often retaining source
identity for Global-South targets. These results highlight that
culture-sensitive edits remain unreliable in current systems. By releasing
standardized data, prompts, and human evaluation protocols, we provide a
reproducible, culture-centered benchmark for diagnosing and tracking cultural
bias in generative image models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事件相机图像重建方法通常依赖GPU上的神经网络，计算复杂且昂贵。本文旨在开发一种更简单、异步且能在CPU上高效运行的重建方法。

Method: 使用时间数字IIR滤波器整合事件强度变化，通过新颖的陈旧像素检测算法调节最近更新像素窗口，对陈旧像素应用高斯滤波以减少噪声。

Result: FIBAR在笔记本电脑CPU上达到约42-140百万事件/秒的处理速度，重建图像比神经网络方法更嘈杂且存在鬼影，但足以完成某些任务如基准标记检测。

Conclusion: FIBAR提供了一种简单有效的异步事件图像重建方法，虽然重建质量不如神经网络方法，但在CPU上的高效性能使其适用于特定应用场景。

Abstract: Reconstructing an intensity image from the events of a moving event camera is
a challenging task that is typically approached with neural networks deployed
on graphics processing units. This paper presents a much simpler, FIlter Based
Asynchronous Reconstruction method (FIBAR). First, intensity changes signaled
by events are integrated with a temporal digital IIR filter. To reduce
reconstruction noise, stale pixels are detected by a novel algorithm that
regulates a window of recently updated pixels. Arguing that for a moving
camera, the absence of events at a pixel location likely implies a low image
gradient, stale pixels are then blurred with a Gaussian filter. In contrast to
most existing methods, FIBAR is asynchronous and permits image read-out at an
arbitrary time. It runs on a modern laptop CPU at about 42(140) million
events/s with (without) spatial filtering enabled. A few simple qualitative
experiments are presented that show the difference in image reconstruction
between FIBAR and a neural network-based approach (FireNet). FIBAR's
reconstruction is noisier than neural network-based methods and suffers from
ghost images. However, it is sufficient for certain tasks such as the detection
of fiducial markers. Code is available at

Conclusion: TBTLRR通过自适应变换、双边结构和噪声处理机制，在图像聚类中取得了显著成功，为张量低秩表示提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Tensor low-rank representation (TLRR) has demonstrated significant success in
image clustering. However, most existing methods rely on fixed transformations
and suffer from poor robustness to noise. In this paper, we propose a novel
transformed bilateral tensor low-rank representation model called TBTLRR, which
introduces a data-adaptive tensor nuclear norm by learning arbitrary unitary
transforms, allowing for more effective capture of global correlations. In
addition, by leveraging the bilateral structure of latent tensor data, TBTLRR
is able to exploit local correlations between image samples and features.
Furthermore, TBTLRR integrates the $\ell_{1/2}$-norm and Frobenius norm
regularization terms for better dealing with complex noise in real-world
scenarios. To solve the proposed nonconvex model, we develop an efficient
optimization algorithm inspired by the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) and provide theoretical convergence. Extensive experiments
validate its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in clustering. The
code will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/TBTLRR.

TL;DR: Endoshare是一个开源跨平台应用，用于标准化和去识别化内窥镜手术视频，解决视频格式异构性和隐私问题，支持手术数据科学应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频评估和手术数据科学在手术培训、研究和质量改进中有重要作用，但受限于异构记录格式和视频共享的隐私担忧。

Method: 采用软件开发生命周期和用户中心反馈，基于隐私设计架构开发，通过内部和外部临床医生调查评估可用性和采纳度，并进行硬件配置基准测试。

Result: 原型测试显示高可用性(4.68/5和4.03/5)，改进后外科医生报告高感知有用性(5.07/7)、易用性(5.15/7)和强烈推荐(9.20/10)，处理时间受处理模式、视频时长和机器计算能力影响。

Conclusion: Endoshare提供了一个透明、用户友好的标准化隐私保护手术视频管理流程，需要合规认证和更广泛的互操作性验证才能成为专有系统的可部署替代方案。

Abstract: Video-based assessment and surgical data science can advance surgical
training, research, and quality improvement. However, widespread use remains
limited by heterogeneous recording formats and privacy concerns associated with
video sharing. We present Endoshare, a source-available, cross-platform
application for merging, standardizing, and de-identifying endoscopic videos in
minimally invasive surgery. Development followed the software development life
cycle with iterative, user-centered feedback. During the analysis phase, an
internal survey of clinicians and computer scientists based on ten usability
heuristics identified key requirements that guided a privacy-by-design
architecture. In the testing phase, an external clinician survey combined the
same heuristics with Technology Acceptance Model constructs to assess usability
and adoption, complemented by benchmarking across different hardware
configurations. Four clinicians and four computer scientists initially tested
the prototype, reporting high usability (4.68 +/- 0.40/5 and 4.03 +/- 0.51/5),
with the lowest score (4.00 +/- 0.93/5) relating to label clarity. After
refinement, the testing phase surveyed ten surgeons who reported high perceived
usefulness (5.07 +/- 1.75/7), ease of use (5.15 +/- 1.71/7), heuristic
usability (4.38 +/- 0.48/5), and strong recommendation (9.20 +/- 0.79/10).
Processing time varied with processing mode, video duration (both p <= 0.001),
and machine computational power (p = 0.041). Endoshare provides a transparent,
user-friendly pipeline for standardized, privacy-preserving surgical video
management. Compliance certification and broader interoperability validation
are needed to establish it as a deployable alternative to proprietary systems.

*Hao Yu,Haoyu Chen,Yan Jiang,Wei Peng,Zhaodong Sun,Samuel Kaski,Guoying Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了Attentive Convolution (ATConv)，一种新的卷积算子，通过引入自适应路由和侧向抑制机制，使CNN能够达到甚至超越自注意力机制的性能，同时保持线性复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力机制虽然表达能力强，但二次复杂度限制了实际应用。卷积虽然复杂度低，但性能存在差距。研究旨在找出自注意力优于卷积的根本原因，并设计能结合两者优势的新算子。

Method: 通过分析自注意力的优势，识别出两个关键原则：自适应路由和侧向抑制。基于这些原则设计了ATConv，在保持3×3卷积核的同时引入这些机制。

Result: ATConv在基础视觉任务中一致优于各种自注意力机制。基于ATConv构建的AttNet在ImageNet-1K上达到84.4%的Top-1准确率（仅27M参数）。在扩散模型中替换自注意力后，ImageNet FID降低了0.15，采样速度更快。

Conclusion: ATConv成功将自注意力的核心优势融入卷积算子，证明了卷积架构通过适当设计可以达到甚至超越自注意力的性能，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: Self-attention (SA) has become the cornerstone of modern vision backbones for
its powerful expressivity over traditional Convolutions (Conv). However, its
quadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for practical applications.
Given that Conv offers linear complexity and strong visual priors, continuing
efforts have been made to promote the renaissance of Conv. However, a
persistent performance chasm remains, highlighting that these modernizations
have not yet captured the intrinsic expressivity that defines SA. In this
paper, we re-examine the design of the CNNs, directed by a key question: what
principles give SA its edge over Conv? As a result, we reveal two fundamental
insights that challenge the long-standing design intuitions in prior research
(e.g., Receptive field). The two findings are: (1) \textit{Adaptive routing}:
SA dynamically regulates positional information flow according to semantic
content, whereas Conv employs static kernels uniformly across all positions.
(2) \textit{Lateral inhibition}: SA induces score competition among token
weighting, effectively suppressing redundancy and sharpening representations,
whereas Conv filters lack such inhibitory dynamics and exhibit considerable
redundancy. Based on this, we propose \textit{Attentive Convolution} (ATConv),
a principled reformulation of the convolutional operator that intrinsically
injects these principles. Interestingly, with only $3\times3$ kernels, ATConv
consistently outperforms various SA mechanisms in fundamental vision tasks.
Building on ATConv, we introduce AttNet, a CNN family that can attain
\textbf{84.4\%} ImageNet-1K Top-1 accuracy with only 27M parameters. In
diffusion-based image generation, replacing all SA with the proposed $3\times
3$ ATConv in SiT-XL/2 reduces ImageNet FID by 0.15 in 400k steps with faster
sampling. Code is available at: github.com/price112/Attentive-Convolution.

Motivation: 尽管扩散模型在图像生成方面取得了进展，但在合成基于像素的手绘草图（抽象表达的代表）方面仍面临挑战。

Method: 微调变分自编码器优化潜在解码，集成基于视觉问答的新奖励函数进行强化学习，提高文本-图像对齐和语义一致性。

Result: 实验表明StableSketcher生成的草图具有改进的风格保真度，与Stable Diffusion基线相比与提示的对齐更好。

Conclusion: 该框架成功提升了扩散模型生成手绘草图的能力，并发布了首个包含实例级草图与标题、问答对的数据集SketchDUO。

Abstract: Although recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly enriched
the quality of generated images, challenges remain in synthesizing pixel-based
human-drawn sketches, a representative example of abstract expression. To
combat these challenges, we propose StableSketcher, a novel framework that
empowers diffusion models to generate hand-drawn sketches with high prompt
fidelity. Within this framework, we fine-tune the variational autoencoder to
optimize latent decoding, enabling it to better capture the characteristics of
sketches. In parallel, we integrate a new reward function for reinforcement
learning based on visual question answering, which improves text-image
alignment and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
StableSketcher generates sketches with improved stylistic fidelity, achieving
better alignment with prompts compared to the Stable Diffusion baseline.
Additionally, we introduce SketchDUO, to the best of our knowledge, the first
dataset comprising instance-level sketches paired with captions and
question-answer pairs, thereby addressing the limitations of existing datasets
that rely on image-label pairs. Our code and dataset will be made publicly
available upon acceptance.

Motivation: 生物图像和描述性标题可以视为物种潜在形态空间中的互补样本，但获取大规模忠实、实例特定的标题存在挑战，这限制了自然语言监督在生物领域的应用。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型生成合成标题，结合维基百科视觉信息和分类群定制格式示例，减少幻觉并产生准确的实例描述性标题，用于训练BIOCAP模型。

Result: BIOCAP模型能够捕捉丰富的语义信息，在物种分类和文本-图像检索任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: 描述性标题超越了传统标签的价值，能够有效连接生物图像与多模态基础模型。

Abstract: This work investigates descriptive captions as an additional source of
supervision for biological multimodal foundation models. Images and captions
can be viewed as complementary samples from the latent morphospace of a
species, each capturing certain biological traits. Incorporating captions
during training encourages alignment with this shared latent structure,
emphasizing potentially diagnostic characters while suppressing spurious
correlations. The main challenge, however, lies in obtaining faithful,
instance-specific captions at scale. This requirement has limited the
utilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology compared with
many other scientific domains. We complement this gap by generating synthetic
captions with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by
Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples. These
domain-specific contexts help reduce hallucination and yield accurate,
instance-based descriptive captions. Using these captions, we train BIOCAP
(i.e., BIOCLIP with Captions), a biological foundation model that captures rich
semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and
text-image retrieval. These results demonstrate the value of descriptive
captions beyond labels in bridging biological images with multimodal foundation
models.

underexplored. This paper addresses the significant challenge of detecting and
tracking rapidly moving small objects using an RGB-D camera. Our novel system
combines deep learning-based detection with physics-based tracking to overcome
the limitations of existing approaches. Our contributions include: (1) a
comprehensive system design for object detection and tracking of fast-moving
small objects in 3D space, (2) an innovative physics-based tracking algorithm
that integrates kinematics motion equations to handle outliers and missed
detections, and (3) an outlier detection and correction module that
significantly improves tracking performance in challenging scenarios such as
occlusions and rapid direction changes. We evaluated our proposed system on a
custom racquetball dataset. Our evaluation shows our system surpassing kalman
filter based trackers with up to 70\% less Average Displacement Error. Our
system has significant applications for improving robot perception on
autonomous platforms and demonstrates the effectiveness of combining
physics-based models with deep learning approaches for real-time 3D detection
and tracking of challenging small objects.

Abstract: A concept of light-fields computed from multiple view images on regular grids
has proven its benefit for scene representations, and supported realistic
renderings of novel views and photographic effects such as refocusing and
shallow depth of field. In spite of its effectiveness of light flow
computations, obtaining light fields requires either computational costs or
specialized devices like a bulky camera setup and a specialized microlens
array. In an effort to broaden its benefit and applicability, in this paper, we
propose a novel view synthesis method for light field generation from only
single images, named inverse image-based rendering. Unlike previous attempts to
implicitly rebuild 3D geometry or to explicitly represent objective scenes, our
method reconstructs light flows in a space from image pixels, which behaves in
the opposite way to image-based rendering. To accomplish this, we design a
neural rendering pipeline to render a target ray in an arbitrary viewpoint. Our
neural renderer first stores the light flow of source rays from the input
image, then computes the relationships among them through cross-attention, and
finally predicts the color of the target ray based on these relationships.
After the rendering pipeline generates the first novel view from a single input
image, the generated out-of-view contents are updated to the set of source
rays. This procedure is iteratively performed while ensuring the consistent
generation of occluded contents. We demonstrate that our inverse image-based
rendering works well with various challenging datasets without any retraining
or finetuning after once trained on synthetic dataset, and outperforms relevant
state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的后处理方法往往未充分利用模型logits空间中的丰富信息，需要更有效地利用logit关系来提升OOD检测性能。

Method: 提出LogitGap方法，利用最大logit与其余logits的关系，并引入无需训练的策略自动识别最具信息量的logits子集进行评分。

Result: 在视觉语言和纯视觉模型上的广泛实验表明，LogitGap在多种OOD检测场景和基准测试中始终达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: LogitGap通过有效利用logit空间关系，提供了一种高效且强大的OOD检测解决方案，理论分析和实证结果均验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models in open-world applications. While post-hoc methods are
favored for their efficiency and ease of deployment, existing approaches often
underexploit the rich information embedded in the model's logits space. In this
paper, we propose LogitGap, a novel post-hoc OOD detection method that
explicitly exploits the relationship between the maximum logit and the
remaining logits to enhance the separability between in-distribution (ID) and
OOD samples. To further improve its effectiveness, we refine LogitGap by
focusing on a more compact and informative subset of the logit space.
Specifically, we introduce a training-free strategy that automatically
identifies the most informative logits for scoring. We provide both theoretical
analysis and empirical evidence to validate the effectiveness of our approach.
Extensive experiments on both vision-language and vision-only models
demonstrate that LogitGap consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance
across diverse OOD detection scenarios and benchmarks. Code is available at

Abstract: Understanding objects at the level of their constituent parts is fundamental
to advancing computer vision, graphics, and robotics. While datasets like
PartNet have driven progress in 3D part understanding, their reliance on
untextured geometries and expert-dependent annotation limits scalability and
usability. We introduce PartNeXt, a next-generation dataset addressing these
gaps with over 23,000 high-quality, textured 3D models annotated with
fine-grained, hierarchical part labels across 50 categories. We benchmark
PartNeXt on two tasks: (1) class-agnostic part segmentation, where
state-of-the-art methods (e.g., PartField, SAMPart3D) struggle with
fine-grained and leaf-level parts, and (2) 3D part-centric question answering,
a new benchmark for 3D-LLMs that reveals significant gaps in open-vocabulary
part grounding. Additionally, training Point-SAM on PartNeXt yields substantial
gains over PartNet, underscoring the dataset's superior quality and diversity.
By combining scalable annotation, texture-aware labels, and multi-task
evaluation, PartNeXt opens new avenues for research in structured 3D
understanding.

movable rigid parts linked by joints and constrained by a kinematic structure.
6D pose methods can estimate the 3D rotation and translation of rigid bicycles,
but 6D becomes insufficient when the steering/pedals angles of the bicycle
vary. That is because: 1) varying the articulated pose of the bicycle causes
its 3D bounding box to vary as well, and 2) the 3D box orientation is not
necessarily aligned to the orientation of the steering which determines the
actual intended travel direction. In this work, we introduce a method for
category-level 8D pose estimation for articulated bicycles and cyclists from a
single RGB image. Besides being able to estimate the 3D translation and
rotation of a bicycle from a single image, our method also estimates the
rotations of its steering handles and pedals with respect to the bicycle body
frame. These two new parameters enable the estimation of a more fine-grained
bicycle pose state and travel direction. Our proposed model jointly estimates
the 8D pose and the 3D Keypoints of articulated bicycles, and trains with a mix
of synthetic and real image data to generalize on real images. We include an
evaluation section where we evaluate the accuracy of our estimated 8D pose
parameters, and our method shows promising results by achieving competitive
scores when compared against state-of-the-art category-level 6D pose estimators
that use rigid canonical object templates for matching.

Motivation: 解决组合零样本学习中由于测试时包含未见属性-对象组合导致的分布偏移问题，现有方法在此情况下性能下降

Method: 1. 从无监督数据中积累文本和视觉知识更新多模态原型；2. 设计自适应更新权重控制原型调整程度；3. 引入动态优先级队列存储高置信度图像；4. 通过多模态协作表示学习对齐文本和视觉原型

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在闭集和开集设置下均达到最先进性能

Conclusion: TOMCAT方法通过多模态知识积累和自适应原型更新，有效应对组合零样本学习中的分布偏移挑战

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel
attribute-object compositions based on the knowledge learned from seen ones.
Existing methods suffer from performance degradation caused by the distribution
shift of label space at test time, which stems from the inclusion of unseen
compositions recombined from attributes and objects. To overcome the challenge,
we propose a novel approach that accumulates comprehensive knowledge in both
textual and visual modalities from unsupervised data to update multimodal
prototypes at test time. Building on this, we further design an adaptive update
weight to control the degree of prototype adjustment, enabling the model to
flexibly adapt to distribution shift during testing. Moreover, a dynamic
priority queue is introduced that stores high-confidence images to acquire
visual knowledge from historical images for inference. Considering the semantic
consistency of multimodal knowledge, we align textual and visual prototypes by
multimodal collaborative representation learning. Extensive experiments
indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four
benchmark datasets under both closed-world and open-world settings. Code will
be available at https://github.com/xud-yan/TOMCAT .

Motivation: 利用信息瓶颈框架优化GAN，实现更好的解耦表示学习，解决现有方法在解耦和生成质量之间的平衡问题

Method: 在生成器中引入中间随机层，约束输入与生成输出之间的互信息，形成可学习的潜在分布，与生成器端到端联合训练

Result: 在dSprites和Color-dSprites数据集上达到与最先进β-VAE相当的解耦分数，在CelebA和3D Chairs数据集上FID得分优于β-VAE和InfoGAN

Conclusion: IB-GAN成功将信息瓶颈应用于GAN优化，实现了更好的解耦表示和生成质量，为无监督解耦学习提供了新思路

Abstract: We propose a new GAN-based unsupervised model for disentangled representation
learning. The new model is discovered in an attempt to utilize the Information
Bottleneck (IB) framework to the optimization of GAN, thereby named IB-GAN. The
architecture of IB-GAN is partially similar to that of InfoGAN but has a
critical difference; an intermediate layer of the generator is leveraged to
constrain the mutual information between the input and the generated output.
The intermediate stochastic layer can serve as a learnable latent distribution
that is trained with the generator jointly in an end-to-end fashion. As a
result, the generator of IB-GAN can harness the latent space in a disentangled
and interpretable manner. With the experiments on dSprites and Color-dSprites
dataset, we demonstrate that IB-GAN achieves competitive disentanglement scores
to those of state-of-the-art \b{eta}-VAEs and outperforms InfoGAN. Moreover,
the visual quality and the diversity of samples generated by IB-GAN are often
better than those by \b{eta}-VAEs and Info-GAN in terms of FID score on CelebA
and 3D Chairs dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决立体视频深度估计中的时间一致性问题，这对于增强现实等应用至关重要。现有方法在建模长期时间依赖性和计算效率之间存在根本性权衡。

Method: 受人类两阶段决策过程启发，提出Pick-and-Play Memory (PPM)模块：'pick'过程选择最相关帧，'play'过程自适应加权选中的帧进行时空聚合，维护紧凑且信息丰富的记忆缓冲区。

Result: 在Sintel数据集上，PPMStereo在clean/final上分别达到0.62/1.11 TEPE，相比BiDAStereo提升了17.3%和9.02%，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: PPMStereo通过两阶段协作过程有效实现了长期时空一致性建模，在精度和时间一致性方面都达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Temporally consistent depth estimation from stereo video is critical for
real-world applications such as augmented reality, where inconsistent depth
estimation disrupts the immersion of users. Despite its importance, this task
remains challenging due to the difficulty in modeling long-term temporal
consistency in a computationally efficient manner. Previous methods attempt to
address this by aggregating spatio-temporal information but face a fundamental
trade-off: limited temporal modeling provides only modest gains, whereas
capturing long-range dependencies significantly increases computational cost.
To address this limitation, we introduce a memory buffer for modeling
long-range spatio-temporal consistency while achieving efficient dynamic stereo
matching. Inspired by the two-stage decision-making process in humans, we
propose a \textbf{P}ick-and-\textbf{P}lay \textbf{M}emory (PPM) construction
module for dynamic \textbf{Stereo} matching, dubbed as \textbf{PPMStereo}. PPM
consists of a `pick' process that identifies the most relevant frames and a
`play' process that weights the selected frames adaptively for spatio-temporal
aggregation. This two-stage collaborative process maintains a compact yet
highly informative memory buffer while achieving temporally consistent
information aggregation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of
PPMStereo, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
temporal consistency. % Notably, PPMStereo achieves 0.62/1.11 TEPE on the
Sintel clean/final (17.3\% \& 9.02\% improvements over BiDAStereo) with fewer
computational costs. Codes are available at

Conclusion: 当前模型在多智能体行为模拟方面表现出色，但仍需改进特定失败模式。

Abstract: Large-scale video generation models have demonstrated high visual realism in
diverse contexts, spurring interest in their potential as general-purpose world
simulators. Existing benchmarks focus on individual subjects rather than scenes
with multiple interacting people. However, the plausibility of multi-agent
dynamics in generated videos remains unverified. We propose a rigorous
evaluation protocol to benchmark text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V)
models as implicit simulators of pedestrian dynamics. For I2V, we leverage
start frames from established datasets to enable comparison with a ground truth
video dataset. For T2V, we develop a prompt suite to explore diverse pedestrian
densities and interactions. A key component is a method to reconstruct 2D
bird's-eye view trajectories from pixel-space without known camera parameters.
Our analysis reveals that leading models have learned surprisingly effective
priors for plausible multi-agent behavior. However, failure modes like merging
and disappearing people highlight areas for future improvement.

Motivation: 现有离散分类方法无法捕捉可疑意图的连续特性，限制了早期干预和可解释性。

Conclusion: 连续可疑度建模方法能实现更早检测和主动干预，显著提升系统可解释性和安全应用实用性。

Abstract: Temporal Intention Localization (TIL) is crucial for video surveillance,
focusing on identifying varying levels of suspicious intentions to improve
security monitoring. However, existing discrete classification methods fail to
capture the continuous nature of suspicious intentions, limiting early
intervention and explainability. In this paper, we propose the Suspicion
Progression Analysis Network (SPAN), which shifts from discrete classification
to continuous regression, enabling the capture of fluctuating and evolving
suspicious intentions. We reveal that suspicion exhibits long-term dependencies
and cumulative effects, similar to Temporal Point Process (TPP) theory. Based
on these insights, we define a suspicion score formula that models continuous
changes while accounting for temporal characteristics. We also introduce
Suspicion Coefficient Modulation, which adjusts suspicion coefficients using
multimodal information to reflect the varying impacts of suspicious actions.
Additionally, the Concept-Anchored Mapping method is proposed to link
suspicious actions to predefined intention concepts, offering insights into
both the actions and their potential underlying intentions. Extensive
experiments on the HAI dataset show that SPAN significantly outperforms
existing methods, reducing MSE by 19.8% and improving average mAP by 1.78%.
Notably, SPAN achieves a 2.74% mAP gain in low-frequency cases, demonstrating
its superior ability to capture subtle behavioral changes. Compared to discrete
classification systems, our continuous suspicion modeling approach enables
earlier detection and proactive intervention, greatly enhancing system
explainability and practical utility in security applications.

Motivation: 脑MRI基础模型的发展依赖于数据的规模、多样性和一致性，但缺乏对这些因素的系统评估

Method: 在数据集层面分析模态组成、疾病覆盖和规模；在图像层面量化体素间距、方向和强度分布；评估预处理变异性；使用3D DenseNet121进行特征空间案例研究

Result: 发现健康队列与临床人群之间存在强烈不平衡，预处理步骤改善了数据集内一致性但无法消除数据集间差异，标准化预处理后仍存在可测量的残差协变量偏移

Conclusion: 公共脑MRI资源存在显著变异性，仅靠数据协调无法消除数据集间偏差，需要预处理感知和领域自适应策略来开发通用脑MRI基础模型

Abstract: The development of foundation models for brain MRI depends critically on the
scale, diversity, and consistency of available data, yet systematic assessments
of these factors remain scarce. In this study, we analyze 54 publicly
accessible brain MRI datasets encompassing over 538,031 to provide a
structured, multi-level overview tailored to foundation model development. At
the dataset level, we characterize modality composition, disease coverage, and
dataset scale, revealing strong imbalances between large healthy cohorts and
smaller clinical populations. At the image level, we quantify voxel spacing,
orientation, and intensity distributions across 15 representative datasets,
demonstrating substantial heterogeneity that can influence representation
learning. We then perform a quantitative evaluation of preprocessing
variability, examining how intensity normalization, bias field correction,
skull stripping, spatial registration, and interpolation alter voxel statistics
and geometry. While these steps improve within-dataset consistency, residual
differences persist between datasets. Finally, feature-space case study using a
3D DenseNet121 shows measurable residual covariate shift after standardized
preprocessing, confirming that harmonization alone cannot eliminate
inter-dataset bias. Together, these analyses provide a unified characterization
of variability in public brain MRI resources and emphasize the need for
preprocessing-aware and domain-adaptive strategies in the design of
generalizable brain MRI foundation models.

<details>

Motivation: 用户提供的提示通常简短、非结构化且与训练数据不匹配，限制了基于扩散的文本到视频模型的生成潜力。

Method: 三阶段框架：1）RAPO阶段使用检索增强和关系图丰富用户提示；2）SSPO阶段通过多源反馈迭代优化提示；3）使用优化提示对微调LLM。

Result: 在五个最先进的T2V模型和五个基准测试中，RAPO++在语义对齐、组合推理、时间稳定性和物理合理性方面取得显著提升，大幅超越现有方法。

Conclusion: RAPO++是一个模型无关、成本高效且可扩展的解决方案，为T2V生成中的提示优化设定了新标准。

Abstract: Prompt design plays a crucial role in text-to-video (T2V) generation, yet
user-provided prompts are often short, unstructured, and misaligned with
training data, limiting the generative potential of diffusion-based T2V models.
We present \textbf{RAPO++}, a cross-stage prompt optimization framework that
unifies training-data--aligned refinement, test-time iterative scaling, and
large language model (LLM) fine-tuning to substantially improve T2V generation
without modifying the underlying generative backbone. In \textbf{Stage 1},
Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Optimization (RAPO) enriches user prompts with
semantically relevant modifiers retrieved from a relation graph and refactors
them to match training distributions, enhancing compositionality and
multi-object fidelity. \textbf{Stage 2} introduces Sample-Specific Prompt
Optimization (SSPO), a closed-loop mechanism that iteratively refines prompts
using multi-source feedback -- including semantic alignment, spatial fidelity,
temporal coherence, and task-specific signals such as optical flow -- yielding
progressively improved video generation quality. \textbf{Stage 3} leverages
optimized prompt pairs from SSPO to fine-tune the rewriter LLM, internalizing
task-specific optimization patterns and enabling efficient, high-quality prompt
generation even before inference. Extensive experiments across five
state-of-the-art T2V models and five benchmarks demonstrate that RAPO++
achieves significant gains in semantic alignment, compositional reasoning,
temporal stability, and physical plausibility, outperforming existing methods
by large margins. Our results highlight RAPO++ as a model-agnostic,
cost-efficient, and scalable solution that sets a new standard for prompt
optimization in T2V generation. The code is available at

Result: 广泛的消融实验表明，FlowCycle在编辑质量和一致性方面优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: FlowCycle通过目标感知的中间状态构建，实现了更好的图像编辑效果，在保持源图像一致性的同时能够进行忠实的修改。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained text-to-image flow models have enabled
remarkable progress in text-based image editing. Mainstream approaches always
adopt a corruption-then-restoration paradigm, where the source image is first
corrupted into an ``intermediate state'' and then restored to the target image
under the prompt guidance. However, current methods construct this intermediate
state in a target-agnostic manner, i.e., they primarily focus on realizing
source image reconstruction while neglecting the semantic gaps towards the
specific editing target. This design inherently results in limited editability
or inconsistency when the desired modifications substantially deviate from the
source. In this paper, we argue that the intermediate state should be
target-aware, i.e., selectively corrupting editing-relevant contents while
preserving editing-irrelevant ones. To this end, we propose FlowCycle, a novel
inversion-free and flow-based editing framework that parameterizes corruption
with learnable noises and optimizes them through a cycle-consistent process. By
iteratively editing the source to the target and recovering back to the source
with dual consistency constraints, FlowCycle learns to produce a target-aware
intermediate state, enabling faithful modifications while preserving source
consistency. Extensive ablations have demonstrated that FlowCycle achieves
superior editing quality and consistency over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Accurate fetal movement (FM) detection is essential for assessing prenatal
health, as abnormal movement patterns can indicate underlying complications
such as placental dysfunction or fetal distress. Traditional methods, including
maternal perception and cardiotocography (CTG), suffer from subjectivity and
limited accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Contrastive
Ultrasound Video Representation Learning (CURL), a novel self-supervised
learning framework for FM detection from extended fetal ultrasound video
recordings. Our approach leverages a dual-contrastive loss, incorporating both
spatial and temporal contrastive learning, to learn robust motion
representations. Additionally, we introduce a task-specific sampling strategy,
ensuring the effective separation of movement and non-movement segments during
self-supervised training, while enabling flexible inference on arbitrarily long
ultrasound recordings through a probabilistic fine-tuning approach. Evaluated
on an in-house dataset of 92 subjects, each with 30-minute ultrasound sessions,
CURL achieves a sensitivity of 78.01% and an AUROC of 81.60%, demonstrating its
potential for reliable and objective FM analysis. These results highlight the
potential of self-supervised contrastive learning for fetal movement analysis,
paving the way for improved prenatal monitoring and clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Adapting pretrained diffusion-based generative models for text-driven image
editing with negligible tuning overhead has demonstrated remarkable potential.
A classical adaptation paradigm, as followed by these methods, first infers the
generative trajectory inversely for a given source image by image inversion,
then performs image editing along the inferred trajectory guided by the target
text prompts. However, the performance of image editing is heavily limited by
the approximation errors introduced during image inversion by diffusion models,
which arise from the absence of exact supervision in the intermediate
generative steps. To circumvent this issue, we investigate the
parameter-efficient adaptation of VQ-based generative models for image editing,
and leverage their inherent characteristic that the exact intermediate
quantized representations of a source image are attainable, enabling more
effective supervision for precise image inversion. Specifically, we propose
\emph{EditInfinity}, which adapts \emph{Infinity}, a binary-quantized
generative model, for image editing. We propose an efficient yet effective
image inversion mechanism that integrates text prompting rectification and
image style preservation, enabling precise image inversion. Furthermore, we
devise a holistic smoothing strategy which allows our \emph{EditInfinity} to
perform image editing with high fidelity to source images and precise semantic
alignment to the text prompts. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench benchmark
across "add", "change", and "delete" editing operations, demonstrate the
superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based
baselines. Code available at: https://github.com/yx-chen-ust/EditInfinity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种"诱导-检测-抑制"框架来解决LVLM在长文本生成中的幻觉问题，认为幻觉主要源于对上下文依赖的增加而非单纯的长度因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在生成长文本时容易出现幻觉问题，传统观点认为这是长度导致的误差累积，但作者质疑是否存在更深层机制。

Method: 提出三步框架：通过精心设计的上下文主动诱导幻觉，利用诱导实例进行早期高风险检测，在实际解码过程中抑制潜在的对象级幻觉。

Result: 在所有基准测试中都取得了持续显著的改进，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 幻觉风险不是由长度本身引起，而是由于长文本中对上下文连贯性和完整性的依赖增加。该研究为深入探索LVLM长文本幻觉提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in recent
years but are also prone to hallucination issues. They exhibit more
hallucinations in longer, free-form responses, often attributed to accumulated
uncertainties. In this paper, we ask: Does increased hallucination result
solely from length-induced errors, or is there a deeper underlying mechanism?
After a series of preliminary experiments and findings, we suggest that the
risk of hallucinations is not caused by length itself but by the increased
reliance on context for coherence and completeness in longer responses.
Building on these insights, we propose a novel "induce-detect-suppress"
framework that actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed
contexts, leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases,
and ultimately suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual
decoding. Our approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all
benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy. The strong detection and improved
hallucination mitigation not only validate our framework but, more importantly,
re-validate our hypothesis on context. Rather than solely pursuing performance
gains, this study aims to provide new insights and serves as a first step
toward a deeper exploration of hallucinations in LVLMs' longer responses.

Motivation: 现有的基于高斯泼溅的方法要么依赖单一3D语言场导致分割效果不佳，要么依赖预计算的类无关分割导致错误累积。

Method: 引入协作场概念（实例场和语言场），通过实例到语言特征映射和两阶段训练策略构建协作场，并在推理时设计自适应语言到实例提示优化。

Result: 在两个广泛使用的基准测试上表现出领先性能，并在多种应用中显示出高潜力。

Conclusion: COS3D通过协作场有效整合语言和分割线索，在开放词汇3D分割任务中取得了优越性能。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging task,
requiring a mutual understanding of both segmentation and language. However,
existing Gaussian-splatting-based methods rely either on a single 3D language
field, leading to inferior segmentation, or on pre-computed class-agnostic
segmentations, suffering from error accumulation. To address these limitations,
we present COS3D, a new collaborative prompt-segmentation framework that
contributes to effectively integrating complementary language and segmentation
cues throughout its entire pipeline. We first introduce the new concept of
collaborative field, comprising an instance field and a language field, as the
cornerstone for collaboration. During training, to effectively construct the
collaborative field, our key idea is to capture the intrinsic relationship
between the instance field and language field, through a novel
instance-to-language feature mapping and designing an efficient two-stage
training strategy. During inference, to bridge distinct characteristics of the
two fields, we further design an adaptive language-to-instance prompt
refinement, promoting high-quality prompt-segmentation inference. Extensive
experiments not only demonstrate COS3D's leading performance over existing
methods on two widely-used benchmarks but also show its high potential to
various applications,~\ie, novel image-based 3D segmentation, hierarchical
segmentation, and robotics. The code is publicly available at

vision-language models such as CLIP and InternVideo2, existing approaches
commonly treat all text tokens uniformly during crossmodal attention,
disregarding their distinct semantic roles. To validate the limitations of this
approach, we conduct controlled experiments demonstrating that VTG models
overly rely on [EOS]-driven global semantics while failing to effectively
utilize word-level signals, which limits their ability to achieve fine-grained
temporal alignment. Motivated by this limitation, we propose DualGround, a
dual-branch architecture that explicitly separates global and local semantics
by routing the [EOS] token through a sentence-level path and clustering word
tokens into phrase-level units for localized grounding. Our method introduces
(1) tokenrole- aware cross modal interaction strategies that align video
features with sentence-level and phrase-level semantics in a structurally
disentangled manner, and (2) a joint modeling framework that not only improves
global sentence-level alignment but also enhances finegrained temporal
grounding by leveraging structured phrase-aware context. This design allows the
model to capture both coarse and localized semantics, enabling more expressive
and context-aware video grounding. DualGround achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection tasks across
QVHighlights and Charades- STA benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
disentangled semantic modeling in video-language alignment.

*Shuhan Hu,Yiru Li,Yuanyuan Li,Yingying Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于掩码的位置编码方案和上下文增强模块，用于改进跨视角物体地理定位，解决了现有方法对标注偏移敏感和跨视角匹配能力有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖基于关键点的位置编码，仅捕获2D坐标而忽略物体形状信息，导致对标注偏移敏感且跨视角匹配能力有限。

Method: 提出掩码位置编码(MPE)方案，利用分割掩码捕获空间坐标和物体轮廓；设计上下文增强模块(CEM)，使用水平和垂直条带卷积核提取长距离上下文特征；集成MPE和CEM构建EDGeo端到端框架。

Result: 在两个公共数据集(CVOGL和VIGOR-Building)上的实验表明，该方法在具有挑战性的地面到卫星场景下实现了最先进的性能，定位精度提高了3.39%。

Conclusion: 这项工作为推进跨视角地理定位研究提供了稳健的位置编码范例和上下文建模框架。

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization enables high-precision object localization
through cross-view matching, with critical applications in autonomous driving,
urban management, and disaster response. However, existing methods rely on
keypoint-based positional encoding, which captures only 2D coordinates while
neglecting object shape information, resulting in sensitivity to annotation
shifts and limited cross-view matching capability. To address these
limitations, we propose a mask-based positional encoding scheme that leverages
segmentation masks to capture both spatial coordinates and object silhouettes,
thereby upgrading the model from "location-aware" to "object-aware."
Furthermore, to tackle the challenge of large-span objects (e.g., elongated
buildings) in satellite imagery, we design a context enhancement module. This
module employs horizontal and vertical strip convolutional kernels to extract
long-range contextual features, enhancing feature discrimination among
strip-like objects. Integrating MPE and CEM, we present EDGeo, an end-to-end
framework for robust cross-view object geo-localization. Extensive experiments
on two public datasets (CVOGL and VIGOR-Building) demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 3.39% improvement in localization
accuracy under challenging ground-to-satellite scenarios. This work provides a
robust positional encoding paradigm and a contextual modeling framework for
advancing cross-view geo-localization research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视多模态间的语义不一致问题，且常被文本模态主导，影响识别准确性。

Method: 使用伪标签生成模块进行单模态自监督预训练，然后通过参数无关融合模块和多模态共识路由器进行多模态微调。

Result: 在四个数据集上达到或超越SOTA性能，在语义不一致场景下表现尤其突出。

Conclusion: CMC能有效缓解文本主导问题，引导融合过程达成更可靠共识，提升多模态情感识别性能。

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) has made substantial
progress. Nevertheless, most existing approaches neglect the semantic
inconsistencies that may arise across modalities, such as conflicting emotional
cues between text and visual inputs. Besides, current methods are often
dominated by the text modality due to its strong representational capacity,
which can compromise recognition accuracy. To address these challenges, we
propose a model termed Calibrated Multimodal Consensus (CMC). CMC introduces a
Pseudo Label Generation Module (PLGM) to produce pseudo unimodal labels,
enabling unimodal pretraining in a self-supervised fashion. It then employs a
Parameter-free Fusion Module (PFM) and a Multimodal Consensus Router (MCR) for
multimodal finetuning, thereby mitigating text dominance and guiding the fusion
process toward a more reliable consensus. Experimental results demonstrate that
CMC achieves performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art methods
across four datasets, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI, and
exhibits notable advantages in scenarios with semantic inconsistencies on
CH-SIMS and CH-SIMS v2. The implementation of this work is publicly accessible
at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CMC.

Motivation: 现有视频异常检测方法在引入多模态信息时仅粗粒度地结合文本特征，忽略了视频片段中可能存在的大量冗余信息。

Method: 基于视频片段生成更细粒度的多模态特征，总结主要内容，并引入原始视频字幕的文本特征来增强视觉特征的突出部分。

Result: 在四个主要数据集上实现了最先进的性能，消融实验验证了性能提升是由于减少了冗余信息。

Conclusion: GMFVAD通过利用多模态信息的多样性来精炼提取的特征，有效减少了视觉特征中的冗余，提升了视频异常检测的性能。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a challenging task that detects anomalous
frames in continuous surveillance videos. Most previous work utilizes the
spatio-temporal correlation of visual features to distinguish whether there are
abnormalities in video snippets. Recently, some works attempt to introduce
multi-modal information, like text feature, to enhance the results of video
anomaly detection. However, these works merely incorporate text features into
video snippets in a coarse manner, overlooking the significant amount of
redundant information that may exist within the video snippets. Therefore, we
propose to leverage the diversity among multi-modal information to further
refine the extracted features, reducing the redundancy in visual features, and
we propose Grained Multi-modal Feature for Video Anomaly Detection (GMFVAD).
Specifically, we generate more grained multi-modal feature based on the video
snippet, which summarizes the main content, and text features based on the
captions of original video will be introduced to further enhance the visual
features of highlighted portions. Experiments show that the proposed GMFVAD
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four mainly datasets. Ablation
experiments also validate that the improvement of GMFVAD is due to the
reduction of redundant information.

Abstract: Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) refers to answering questions and
providing explanations based on images. While existing methods achieve high
prediction accuracy, they often overlook bias in datasets and lack debiasing
strategies. In this paper, our analysis reveals co-occurrence and statistical
biases in both textual and visual data. We introduce the VCR-OOD datasets,
comprising VCR-OOD-QA and VCR-OOD-VA subsets, which are designed to evaluate
the generalization capabilities of models across two modalities. Furthermore,
we analyze the causal graphs and prediction shortcuts in VCR and adopt a
backdoor adjustment method to remove bias. Specifically, we create a dictionary
based on the set of correct answers to eliminate prediction shortcuts.
Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our debiasing method across
different datasets.

<details>

Motivation: 解决复杂值合成孔径雷达图像识别在数据有限和领域偏移场景下面临的泛化性、可解释性和效率之间的三难问题，充分利用CV-SAR数据中丰富的电磁散射特征。

Method: 采用'压缩-聚合-压缩'架构：物理引导压缩阶段通过字典处理器嵌入物理先验，展开网络提取稀疏物理特征；聚合模块丰富表示；语义压缩阶段使用紧凑分类头和自蒸馏学习任务相关嵌入。

Conclusion: KINN有效解决了表示三难问题，为SAR图像分析中的可信AI提供了新路径。

Abstract: Deep learning models for complex-valued Synthetic Aperture Radar (CV-SAR)
image recognition are fundamentally constrained by a representation trilemma
under data-limited and domain-shift scenarios: the concurrent, yet conflicting,
optimization of generalization, interpretability, and efficiency. Our work is
motivated by the premise that the rich electromagnetic scattering features
inherent in CV-SAR data hold the key to resolving this trilemma, yet they are
insufficiently harnessed by conventional data-driven models. To this end, we
introduce the Knowledge-Informed Neural Network (KINN), a lightweight framework
built upon a novel "compression-aggregation-compression" architecture. The
first stage performs a physics-guided compression, wherein a novel dictionary
processor adaptively embeds physical priors, enabling a compact unfolding
network to efficiently extract sparse, physically-grounded signatures. A
subsequent aggregation module enriches these representations, followed by a
final semantic compression stage that utilizes a compact classification head
with self-distillation to learn maximally task-relevant and discriminative
embeddings. We instantiate KINN in both CNN (0.7M) and Vision Transformer
(0.95M) variants. Extensive evaluations on five SAR benchmarks confirm that
KINN establishes a state-of-the-art in parameter-efficient recognition,
offering exceptional generalization in data-scarce and out-of-distribution
scenarios and tangible interpretability, thereby providing an effective
solution to the representation trilemma and offering a new path for trustworthy
AI in SAR image analysis.

Conclusion: DMC³框架有效解决了第一人称视频问答中的独特挑战，显著提升了性能

Abstract: Egocentric Video Question Answering (Egocentric VideoQA) plays an important
role in egocentric video understanding, which refers to answering questions
based on first-person videos. Although existing methods have made progress
through the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning, they ignore the unique
challenges posed by the first-person perspective, such as understanding
multiple events and recognizing hand-object interactions. To deal with these
challenges, we propose a Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction
(DMC$^3$) framework, which contains an egocentric videoqa baseline, a
counterfactual sample construction module and a counterfactual sample-involved
contrastive optimization. Specifically, We first develop a counterfactual
sample construction module to generate positive and negative samples for
textual and visual modalities through event description paraphrasing and core
interaction mining, respectively. Then, We feed these samples together with the
original samples into the baseline. Finally, in the counterfactual
sample-involved contrastive optimization module, we apply contrastive loss to
minimize the distance between the original sample features and the positive
sample features, while maximizing the distance from the negative samples.
Experiments show that our method achieve 52.51\% and 46.04\% on the
\textit{normal} and \textit{indirect} splits of EgoTaskQA, and 13.2\% on
QAEGO4D, both reaching the state-of-the-art performance.

Result: UI-Ins-7B和UI-Ins-32B模型在五个grounding基准测试中取得SOTA结果：UI-I2E-Bench 87.3%、ScreenSpot-Pro 57.0%、MMBench-GUI L2 84.9%。UI-Ins-7B在AndroidWorld上达到74.1%的成功率。

Conclusion: 提出的方法不仅提升了grounding性能，还展现出涌现推理能力，能够选择性地组合和合成新的指令路径，同时缓解了SFT+RL框架中的策略崩溃问题。

Abstract: GUI grounding, which maps natural-language instructions to actionable UI
elements, is a core capability of GUI agents. Prior works largely treats
instructions as a static proxy for user intent, overlooking the impact of
instruction diversity and quality on grounding performance. Through a careful
investigation of existing grounding datasets, we find a 23.3% flaw rate in
their instructions and show that inference-time exploitation of instruction
diversity yields up to a substantial 76% relative performance improvement. In
this paper, we introduce the Instruction-as-Reasoning paradigm, treating
instructions as dynamic analytical pathways that offer distinct perspectives
and enabling the model to select the most effective pathway during reasoning.
To achieve this, we propose a two-stage training framework: supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on synthesized, diverse instructions to instill
multi-perspective reasoning, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to
optimize pathway selection and composition. Our resulting models, UI-Ins-7B and
UI-Ins-32B, achieve state-of-the-art results on five challenging grounding
benchmarks and exhibit emergent reasoning, selectively composing and
synthesizing novel instruction pathways at inference. In particular, UI-Ins-32B
attains the best grounding accuracy, scoring 87.3% on UI-I2E-Bench, 57.0% on
ScreenSpot-Pro, and 84.9% on MMBench-GUI L2. Furthermore, our model
demonstrates strong agentic potential, achieving a 74.1% success rate on
AndroidWorld using UI-Ins-7B as the executor. Our in-depth analysis reveals
additional insights such as how reasoning can be formulated to enhance rather
than hinder grounding performance, and how our method mitigates policy collapse
in the SFT+RL framework. All code and model checkpoints will be publicly
released in https://github.com/alibaba/UI-Ins.

Result: 在多个MLLM基准测试上的综合实验表明，HyperET能够持续改进现有预训练和微调MLLMs，性能提升明显，仅需增加不到1%的额外参数。

Conclusion: HyperET通过双曲空间中的动态粒度对齐，提供了一种高效的多模态大语言模型训练方法，显著减少了计算资源需求，同时提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as a transformative
approach for aligning visual and textual understanding. They typically require
extremely high computational resources (e.g., thousands of GPUs) for training
to achieve cross-modal alignment at multi-granularity levels. We argue that a
key source of this inefficiency lies in the vision encoders they widely equip
with, e.g., CLIP and SAM, which lack the alignment with language at
multi-granularity levels. To address this issue, in this paper, we leverage
hyperbolic space, which inherently models hierarchical levels and thus provides
a principled framework for bridging the granularity gap between visual and
textual modalities at an arbitrary granularity level. Concretely, we propose an
efficient training paradigm for MLLMs, dubbed as HyperET, which can optimize
visual representations to align with their textual counterparts at an arbitrary
granularity level through dynamic hyperbolic radius adjustment in hyperbolic
space. HyperET employs learnable matrices with M\"{o}bius multiplication
operations, implemented via three effective configurations: diagonal scaling
matrices, block-diagonal matrices, and banded matrices, providing a flexible
yet efficient parametrization strategy. Comprehensive experiments across
multiple MLLM benchmarks demonstrate that HyperET consistently improves both
existing pre-training and fine-tuning MLLMs clearly with less than 1\%
additional parameters.

Conclusion: AnyPcc通过通用上下文模型和实例自适应微调有效解决了点云压缩的泛化问题，实现了最先进的压缩性能。

Abstract: Generalization remains a critical challenge for deep learning-based point
cloud geometry compression. We argue this stems from two key limitations: the
lack of robust context models and the inefficient handling of
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To address both, we introduce AnyPcc, a
universal point cloud compression framework. AnyPcc first employs a Universal
Context Model that leverages priors from both spatial and channel-wise grouping
to capture robust contextual dependencies. Second, our novel Instance-Adaptive
Fine-Tuning (IAFT) strategy tackles OOD data by synergizing explicit and
implicit compression paradigms. It fine-tunes a small subset of network weights
for each instance and incorporates them into the bitstream, where the marginal
bit cost of the weights is dwarfed by the resulting savings in geometry
compression. Extensive experiments on a benchmark of 15 diverse datasets
confirm that AnyPcc sets a new state-of-the-art in point cloud compression. Our
code and datasets will be released to encourage reproducible research.

Result: 在多个任务和扩散模型的标准基准测试中，AccuQuant展现出优异的效能和效率。

Conclusion: AccuQuant通过解决量化误差累积问题，为扩散模型提供了高效的后训练量化解决方案。

Abstract: We present in this paper a novel post-training quantization (PTQ) method,
dubbed AccuQuant, for diffusion models. We show analytically and empirically
that quantization errors for diffusion models are accumulated over denoising
steps in a sampling process. To alleviate the error accumulation problem,
AccuQuant minimizes the discrepancies between outputs of a full-precision
diffusion model and its quantized version within a couple of denoising steps.
That is, it simulates multiple denoising steps of a diffusion sampling process
explicitly for quantization, accounting the accumulated errors over multiple
denoising steps, which is in contrast to previous approaches to imitating a
training process of diffusion models, namely, minimizing the discrepancies
independently for each step. We also present an efficient implementation
technique for AccuQuant, together with a novel objective, which reduces a
memory complexity significantly from $\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$,
where $n$ is the number of denoising steps. We demonstrate the efficacy and
efficiency of AccuQuant across various tasks and diffusion models on standard
benchmarks.

Motivation: 研究发现DiT中的patch tokens表现出惊人的独立性，即使位置编码被扰动，DiT仍能产生全局一致的输出，表明空间一致性主要由位置编码控制。

Method: 引入位置编码场（PE-Field），将位置编码从2D平面扩展到结构化3D场，包含深度感知编码用于体积推理和分层编码用于细粒度子patch控制。

Result: PE-Field增强的DiT在单图像新视角合成方面实现了最先进性能，并能推广到可控空间图像编辑。

Conclusion: 通过将位置编码扩展到3D场，DiT能够直接在3D空间中建模几何，为视觉生成任务提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the dominant architecture for
visual generation, powering state-of-the-art image and video models. By
representing images as patch tokens with positional encodings (PEs), DiTs
combine Transformer scalability with spatial and temporal inductive biases. In
this work, we revisit how DiTs organize visual content and discover that patch
tokens exhibit a surprising degree of independence: even when PEs are
perturbed, DiTs still produce globally coherent outputs, indicating that
spatial coherence is primarily governed by PEs. Motivated by this finding, we
introduce the Positional Encoding Field (PE-Field), which extends positional
encodings from the 2D plane to a structured 3D field. PE-Field incorporates
depth-aware encodings for volumetric reasoning and hierarchical encodings for
fine-grained sub-patch control, enabling DiTs to model geometry directly in 3D
space. Our PE-Field-augmented DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on
single-image novel view synthesis and generalizes to controllable spatial image
editing.

*Qing Wang,Chong-Wah Ngo,Yu Cao,Ee-Peng Lim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种因果表示学习方法，通过预测图像中可能被忽略的烹饪元素并显式注入跨模态表示学习来缓解偏差，在单语和多语言多文化数据集上实现优异的图像到菜谱检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像到菜谱检索方法假设食物图像能完全捕捉菜谱文本细节，但图像仅反映烹饪结果而非过程，导致跨模态表示学习忽略不直观但对检索关键的细微差异，特别是在多文化数据集上偏差更严重。

Method: 提出因果表示学习方法，预测图像中可能被忽略的烹饪元素（如细微配料和烹饪动作），并显式将这些元素注入跨模态表示学习以缓解偏差。

Result: 在标准单语Recipe1M数据集和新构建的多语言多文化数据集上的实验表明，该方法能够发现细微配料和烹饪动作，在两个数据集上都取得了令人印象深刻的检索性能。

Conclusion: 因果表示学习方法有效解决了图像到菜谱检索中的表示偏差问题，能够捕捉视觉不明显但对检索关键的细微烹饪元素，在单语和多语言多文化场景下均表现出色。

Abstract: Existing approaches for image-to-recipe retrieval have the implicit
assumption that a food image can fully capture the details textually documented
in its recipe. However, a food image only reflects the visual outcome of a
cooked dish and not the underlying cooking process. Consequently, learning
cross-modal representations to bridge the modality gap between images and
recipes tends to ignore subtle, recipe-specific details that are not visually
apparent but are crucial for recipe retrieval. Specifically, the
representations are biased to capture the dominant visual elements, resulting
in difficulty in ranking similar recipes with subtle differences in use of
ingredients and cooking methods. The bias in representation learning is
expected to be more severe when the training data is mixed of images and
recipes sourced from different cuisines. This paper proposes a novel causal
approach that predicts the culinary elements potentially overlooked in images,
while explicitly injecting these elements into cross-modal representation
learning to mitigate biases. Experiments are conducted on the standard
monolingual Recipe1M dataset and a newly curated multilingual multicultural
cuisine dataset. The results indicate that the proposed causal representation
learning is capable of uncovering subtle ingredients and cooking actions and
achieves impressive retrieval performance on both monolingual and multilingual
multicultural datasets.

TL;DR: 提出FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet模型，通过动态模糊逻辑驱动的知识蒸馏方法进行肺癌分类，在LC25000数据集上达到99.16%准确率，在IQOTH/NCCD CT扫描数据集上达到99.54%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统静态知识蒸馏模型在处理医学图像不确定性时的局限性，通过动态调整蒸馏权重来更好地处理肺癌图像中不同区域的不确定性水平。

Method: 使用ViT-B32作为教师模型，MobileNet作为学生模型，采用动态模糊逻辑调整蒸馏权重，结合图像融合技术（Gamma校正和直方图均衡化）和遗传算法选择最优学生模型。

Result: 在两个数据集上均取得超过99%的高准确率，证明了模型在不同成像域中的鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: 该动态模糊知识蒸馏方法能够有效处理医学图像中的不确定性，提高肺癌分类的准确性和泛化能力，为医学诊断提供了可靠的工具。

Abstract: This paper presents the FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet model, a novel approach for
lung cancer (LC) classification, leveraging dynamic fuzzy logic-driven
knowledge distillation (KD) to address uncertainty and complexity in disease
diagnosis. Unlike traditional models that rely on static KD with fixed weights,
our method dynamically adjusts the distillation weight using fuzzy logic,
enabling the student model to focus on high-confidence regions while reducing
attention to ambiguous areas. This dynamic adjustment improves the model
ability to handle varying uncertainty levels across different regions of LC
images. We employ the Vision Transformer (ViT-B32) as the instructor model,
which effectively transfers knowledge to the student model, MobileNet,
enhancing the student generalization capabilities. The training process is
further optimized using a dynamic wait adjustment mechanism that adapts the
training procedure for improved convergence and performance. To enhance image
quality, we introduce pixel-level image fusion improvement techniques such as
Gamma correction and Histogram Equalization. The processed images (Pix1 and
Pix2) are fused using a wavelet-based fusion method to improve image resolution
and feature preservation. This fusion method uses the wavedec2 function to
standardize images to a 224x224 resolution, decompose them into multi-scale
frequency components, and recursively average coefficients at each level for
better feature representation. To address computational efficiency, Genetic
Algorithm (GA) is used to select the most suitable pre-trained student model
from a pool of 12 candidates, balancing model performance with computational
cost. The model is evaluated on two datasets, including LC25000
histopathological images (99.16% accuracy) and IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan images
(99.54% accuracy), demonstrating robustness across different imaging domains.

TL;DR: Conan是一个基于证据的多步骤视频推理框架，通过识别上下文和证据帧、跨帧线索推理以及自适应决策，解决了MLLMs在视频推理中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频推理方法存在文本链产生无根据结论或证据定位不准确的问题，需要一种能够结合视觉基础和多步骤推理的方法。

Method: 构建了Conan-91K大规模数据集，设计了多阶段渐进冷启动策略和识别-推理-动作(IRA)RLVR训练框架，联合增强多步骤视觉推理。

Result: 在六个多步骤推理基准测试中，Conan平均比基线Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct准确率提高超过10%，达到最先进性能，并在长视频理解任务中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Conan框架有效解决了视频推理中的证据定位和多步骤推理问题，展现出强大的可扩展性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Video reasoning, which requires multi-step deduction across frames, remains a
major challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While
reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods enhance reasoning capabilities, they
often rely on text-only chains that yield ungrounded or hallucinated
conclusions. Conversely, frame-retrieval approaches introduce visual grounding
but still struggle with inaccurate evidence localization. To address these
challenges, we present Conan, a framework for evidence-grounded multi-step
video reasoning. Conan identifies contextual and evidence frames, reasons over
cross-frame clues, and adaptively decides when to conclude or explore further.
To achieve this, we (1) construct Conan-91K, a large-scale dataset of
automatically generated reasoning traces that includes frame identification,
evidence reasoning, and action decision, and (2) design a multi-stage
progressive cold-start strategy combined with an
Identification-Reasoning-Action (AIR) RLVR training framework to jointly
enhance multi-step visual reasoning. Extensive experiments on six multi-step
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Conan surpasses the baseline
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by an average of over 10% in accuracy, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, Conan generalizes effectively to
long-video understanding tasks, validating its strong scalability and
robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸分析系统的公平性评估依赖自动人口属性推断，但现有方法的可靠性存在问题，影响公平性审计的有效性

Method: 使用预训练人脸识别编码器结合非线性分类头的模块化迁移学习方法，替代传统的端到端训练

Result: 该方法在性别和种族推断任务上优于强基线，特别是在更具挑战性的种族属性上表现更佳

Conclusion: 这项工作为公平性审计中的人口属性推断提供了可靠基础，促进了透明度和可复现性

Abstract: Fairness evaluation in face analysis systems (FAS) typically depends on
automatic demographic attribute inference (DAI), which itself relies on
predefined demographic segmentation. However, the validity of fairness auditing
hinges on the reliability of the DAI process. We begin by providing a
theoretical motivation for this dependency, showing that improved DAI
reliability leads to less biased and lower-variance estimates of FAS fairness.
To address this, we propose a fully reproducible DAI pipeline that replaces
conventional end-to-end training with a modular transfer learning approach. Our
design integrates pretrained face recognition encoders with non-linear
classification heads. We audit this pipeline across three dimensions: accuracy,
fairness, and a newly introduced notion of robustness, defined via
intra-identity consistency. The proposed robustness metric is applicable to any
demographic segmentation scheme. We benchmark the pipeline on gender and
ethnicity inference across multiple datasets and training setups. Our results
show that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines, particularly on
ethnicity, which is the more challenging attribute. To promote transparency and
reproducibility, we will publicly release the training dataset metadata, full
codebase, pretrained models, and evaluation toolkit. This work contributes a
reliable foundation for demographic inference in fairness auditing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoDistill是一个双向概念蒸馏框架，用于实现一步扩散个性化(1-SDP)，通过师生模型协同训练，在保持生成质量的同时加速文本到图像模型的个性化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的一步扩散模型在个性化新概念时能力有限，难以有效捕捉新概念的分布，需要开发能够快速个性化且保持高质量的方法。

Method: 采用端到端训练，同时训练多步扩散模型(教师)和一步扩散模型(学生)，通过双向概念蒸馏机制，包括概念从教师到学生的蒸馏和从学生到教师的反馈，并共享文本编码器确保语义一致性。

Result: 实验表明该框架在1-SDP设置下显著优于现有个性化方法，不仅提升了学生模型对新概念的个性化能力，还改善了教师模型的生成质量。

Conclusion: EchoDistill为T2I扩散模型建立了一种快速有效个性化的新范式，通过双向协作机制实现了高质量的一步扩散个性化。

Abstract: Recent advances in accelerating text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have
enabled the synthesis of high-fidelity images even in a single step. However,
personalizing these models to incorporate novel concepts remains a challenge
due to the limited capacity of one-step models to capture new concept
distributions effectively. We propose a bidirectional concept distillation
framework, EchoDistill, to enable one-step diffusion personalization (1-SDP).
Our approach involves an end-to-end training process where a multi-step
diffusion model (teacher) and a one-step diffusion model (student) are trained
simultaneously. The concept is first distilled from the teacher model to the
student, and then echoed back from the student to the teacher. During the
EchoDistill, we share the text encoder between the two models to ensure
consistent semantic understanding. Following this, the student model is
optimized with adversarial losses to align with the real image distribution and
with alignment losses to maintain consistency with the teacher's output.
Furthermore, we introduce the bidirectional echoing refinement strategy,
wherein the student model leverages its faster generation capability to
feedback to the teacher model. This bidirectional concept distillation
mechanism not only enhances the student ability to personalize novel concepts
but also improves the generative quality of the teacher model. Our experiments
demonstrate that this collaborative framework significantly outperforms
existing personalization methods over the 1-SDP setup, establishing a novel
paradigm for rapid and effective personalization in T2I diffusion models.

Motivation: 当前多模态大推理模型存在两个关键局限：对简单查询使用计算昂贵的推理导致效率低下，以及专注于专业推理损害了更广泛的通用理解能力。

Method: 将原始密集模型重构为两个专家分支：思考分支用于复杂多步推理，非思考分支用于快速直接推理。使用轻量级可训练路由器动态分配查询。

Conclusion: 建立了一个构建强大且多功能MLLM的新范式，有效解决了普遍存在的推理与泛化困境。

Abstract: Inspired by recent advancements in LLM reasoning, the field of multimodal
reasoning has seen remarkable progress, achieving significant performance gains
on intricate tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Despite this progress,
current multimodal large reasoning models exhibit two key limitations. They
tend to employ computationally expensive reasoning even for simple queries,
leading to inefficiency. Furthermore, this focus on specialized reasoning often
impairs their broader, more general understanding capabilities. In this paper,
we propose Metis-HOME: a Hybrid Optimized Mixture-of-Experts framework designed
to address this trade-off. Metis-HOME enables a ''Hybrid Thinking'' paradigm by
structuring the original dense model into two distinct expert branches: a
thinking branch tailored for complex, multi-step reasoning, and a non-thinking
branch optimized for rapid, direct inference on tasks like general VQA and OCR.
A lightweight, trainable router dynamically allocates queries to the most
suitable expert. We instantiate Metis-HOME by adapting the Qwen2.5-VL-7B into
an MoE architecture. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that our approach not
only substantially enhances complex reasoning abilities but also improves the
model's general capabilities, reversing the degradation trend observed in other
reasoning-specialized models. Our work establishes a new paradigm for building
powerful and versatile MLLMs, effectively resolving the prevalent
reasoning-vs-generalization dilemma.

Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型在可解释深度伪造分析中存在细粒度感知不足的问题，包括数据标注不可靠、无法建立文本解释与视觉证据的连接，以及不支持任意面部区域的查询。

Method: 定义了面部图像概念树进行细粒度区域划分，提出FiFa-Annotator数据标注流程和伪影定位解释任务，构建了统一的FiFa-MLLM多任务学习架构。

Conclusion: FiFa框架通过细粒度数据标注和统一的多任务架构，显著提升了可解释深度伪造分析的性能，代码和数据将开源。

Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has bridged the
gap between vision and language tasks, enabling the implementation of
Explainable DeepFake Analysis (XDFA). However, current methods suffer from a
lack of fine-grained awareness: the description of artifacts in data annotation
is unreliable and coarse-grained, and the models fail to support the output of
connections between textual forgery explanations and the visual evidence of
artifacts, as well as the input of queries for arbitrary facial regions. As a
result, their responses are not sufficiently grounded in Face Visual Context
(Facext). To address this limitation, we propose the Fake-in-Facext (FiFa)
framework, with contributions focusing on data annotation and model
construction. We first define a Facial Image Concept Tree (FICT) to divide
facial images into fine-grained regional concepts, thereby obtaining a more
reliable data annotation pipeline, FiFa-Annotator, for forgery explanation.
Based on this dedicated data annotation, we introduce a novel
Artifact-Grounding Explanation (AGE) task, which generates textual forgery
explanations interleaved with segmentation masks of manipulated artifacts. We
propose a unified multi-task learning architecture, FiFa-MLLM, to
simultaneously support abundant multimodal inputs and outputs for fine-grained
Explainable DeepFake Analysis. With multiple auxiliary supervision tasks,
FiFa-MLLM can outperform strong baselines on the AGE task and achieve SOTA
performance on existing XDFA datasets. The code and data will be made
open-source at https://github.com/lxq1000/Fake-in-Facext.

Conclusion: 该框架不仅能恢复清晰图像，还能揭示产生模糊的相机运动轨迹，提供可解释性，并能重建生成模糊图像的清晰图像序列。

Abstract: Motion blur caused by camera shake, particularly under large or rotational
movements, remains a major challenge in image restoration. We propose a deep
learning framework that jointly estimates the latent sharp image and the
underlying camera motion trajectory from a single blurry image. Our method
leverages the Projective Motion Blur Model (PMBM), implemented efficiently
using a differentiable blur creation module compatible with modern networks. A
neural network predicts a full 3D rotation trajectory, which guides a
model-based restoration network trained end-to-end. This modular architecture
provides interpretability by revealing the camera motion that produced the
blur. Moreover, this trajectory enables the reconstruction of the sequence of
sharp images that generated the observed blurry image. To further refine
results, we optimize the trajectory post-inference via a reblur loss, improving
consistency between the blurry input and the restored output. Extensive
experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
synthetic and real datasets, particularly in cases with severe or spatially
variant blur, where end-to-end deblurring networks struggle.

conditions such as low-texture, motion-blur, or challenging lighting remains an

Conclusion: ACamera-Net是一个有效的相机参数调整解决方案，能够适应不同光照条件，在边缘设备上实现实时性能，显著改善图像质量和下游视觉任务表现。

Abstract: Consumer-grade camera systems often struggle to maintain stable image quality
under complex illumination conditions such as low light, high dynamic range,
and backlighting, as well as spatial color temperature variation. These issues
lead to underexposure, color casts, and tonal inconsistency, which degrade the
performance of downstream vision tasks. To address this, we propose
ACamera-Net, a lightweight and scene-adaptive camera parameter adjustment
network that directly predicts optimal exposure and white balance from RAW
inputs. The framework consists of two modules: ACamera-Exposure, which
estimates ISO to alleviate underexposure and contrast loss, and ACamera-Color,
which predicts correlated color temperature and gain factors for improved color
consistency. Optimized for real-time inference on edge devices, ACamera-Net can
be seamlessly integrated into imaging pipelines. Trained on diverse real-world
data with annotated references, the model generalizes well across lighting
conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACamera-Net consistently
enhances image quality and stabilizes perception outputs, outperforming
conventional auto modes and lightweight baselines without relying on additional
image enhancement modules.

Abstract: The realization of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) necessitates
Embodied AI agents capable of robust spatial perception, effective task
planning, and adaptive execution in physical environments. However, current
large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for embodied tasks
suffer from key limitations, including a significant gap between model design

these challenges, we propose EmbodiedBrain, a novel vision-language foundation

agent-aligned data structure and employs a powerful training methodology that
integrates large-scale Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Step-Augumented Group
Relative Policy Optimization (Step-GRPO), which boosts long-horizon task
success by integrating preceding steps as Guided Precursors. Furthermore, we
incorporate a comprehensive reward system, including a Generative Reward Model

For enable thorough validation, we establish a three-part evaluation system
encompassing General, Planning, and End-to-End Simulation Benchmarks,
highlighted by the proposal and open-sourcing of a novel, challenging
simulation environment. Experimental results demonstrate that EmbodiedBrain
achieves superior performance across all metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for embodied foundation models. Towards paving the way for the

Result: 在V-STAR基准测试中，Open-o3 Video实现了最先进的性能，将Qwen2.5-VL基线的mAM提高了14.4%，mLGM提高了24.2%。在包括VideoMME、WorldSense、VideoMMMU和TVGBench在内的广泛视频理解基准测试中也观察到一致的改进。

Conclusion: 除了准确性之外，Open-o3 Video生成的推理轨迹还为测试时扩展提供了有价值的信号，实现了置信度感知验证并提高了答案可靠性。

Abstract: Most video reasoning models only generate textual reasoning traces without
indicating when and where key evidence appears. Recent models such as OpenAI-o3
have sparked wide interest in evidence-centered reasoning for images, yet
extending this ability to videos is more challenging, as it requires joint
temporal tracking and spatial localization across dynamic scenes. We introduce
Open-o3 Video, a non-agent framework that integrates explicit spatio-temporal
evidence into video reasoning, and carefully collect training data and design
training strategies to address the aforementioned challenges. The model
highlights key timestamps, objects, and bounding boxes alongside its answers,
allowing reasoning to be grounded in concrete visual observations. To enable
this functionality, we first curate and build two high-quality datasets,
STGR-CoT-30k for SFT and STGR-RL-36k for RL, with carefully constructed
temporal and spatial annotations, since most existing datasets offer either
temporal spans for videos or spatial boxes on images, lacking unified
spatio-temporal supervision and reasoning traces. Then, we adopt a cold-start
reinforcement learning strategy with multiple specially designed rewards that
jointly encourage answer accuracy, temporal alignment, and spatial precision.
On V-STAR benchmark, Open-o3 Video achieves state-of-the-art performance,
raising mAM by 14.4% and mLGM by 24.2% on the Qwen2.5-VL baseline. Consistent
improvements are also observed on a broad range of video understanding
benchmarks, including VideoMME, WorldSense, VideoMMMU, and TVGBench. Beyond
accuracy, the reasoning traces produced by Open-o3 Video also provide valuable
signals for test-time scaling, enabling confidence-aware verification and
improving answer reliability.

*Muhammad Atif Butt,Alexandra Gomez-Villa,Tao Wu,Javier Vazquez-Corral,Joost Van De Weijer,Kai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了GenColorBench，首个专注于文本到图像颜色生成的综合基准测试，包含44K个颜色相关提示，覆盖400多种颜色，通过感知和自动评估揭示模型在颜色控制方面的真实能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型在细粒度颜色可控性方面表现不佳，无法准确匹配文本提示中指定的颜色。当前基准测试要么忽略颜色评估，要么依赖粗略评估，缺乏对RGB值解释和人类期望对齐等关键能力的系统评估。

Method: 基于ISCC-NBS和CSS3/X11颜色系统构建基准测试，包含数值颜色（在其他基准中缺失），通过44K个颜色聚焦提示进行模型评估，采用感知和自动化两种评估方式。

Result: 对流行文本到图像模型的评估显示性能存在差异，揭示了模型对不同颜色约定的理解程度，并识别了失败模式。

Conclusion: GenColorBench评估将指导精确颜色生成的改进，基准测试将在接受后公开。

Abstract: Recent years have seen impressive advances in text-to-image generation, with
image generative or unified models producing high-quality images from text. Yet
these models still struggle with fine-grained color controllability, often
failing to accurately match colors specified in text prompts. While existing
benchmarks evaluate compositional reasoning and prompt adherence, none
systematically assess color precision. Color is fundamental to human visual
perception and communication, critical for applications from art to design
workflows requiring brand consistency. However, current benchmarks either
neglect color or rely on coarse assessments, missing key capabilities such as
interpreting RGB values or aligning with human expectations. To this end, we
propose GenColorBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for text-to-image
color generation, grounded in color systems like ISCC-NBS and CSS3/X11,
including numerical colors which are absent elsewhere. With 44K color-focused
prompts covering 400+ colors, it reveals models' true capabilities via
perceptual and automated assessments. Evaluations of popular text-to-image
models using GenColorBench show performance variations, highlighting which
color conventions models understand best and identifying failure modes. Our
GenColorBench assessments will guide improvements in precise color generation.
The benchmark will be made public upon acceptance.

*Ziyu Ye,Chen Ju,Chaofan Ma,Xiaoyun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于相似性原型的跨模态分割框架，通过类别原型学习和相似性约束来解决领域自适应问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在领域转移时性能急剧下降，需要无监督领域自适应来减少领域差距并避免昂贵标注。

Method: 在嵌入空间中学习类别原型，引入相似性约束使原型具有代表性且类别间可分，使用字典存储不同图像的原型以解决类别缺失问题并支持对比学习。

Result: 大量实验表明该方法优于其他最先进方法。

Conclusion: 基于相似性原型的框架能有效提升跨模态分割性能。

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved great success on various vision
challenges, but a well-trained model would face drastic performance degradation
when applied to unseen data. Since the model is sensitive to domain shift,
unsupervised domain adaptation attempts to reduce the domain gap and avoid
costly annotation of unseen domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for
cross-modality segmentation via similarity-based prototypes. In specific, we
learn class-wise prototypes within an embedding space, then introduce a
similarity constraint to make these prototypes representative for each semantic
class while separable from different classes. Moreover, we use dictionaries to
store prototypes extracted from different images, which prevents the
class-missing problem and enables the contrastive learning of prototypes, and
further improves performance. Extensive experiments show that our method
achieves better results than other state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: OnlineSplatter是一个在线前馈框架，无需相机位姿或深度先验，直接从RGB视频帧生成高质量的对象中心3D高斯表示，适用于自由移动物体的重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单目视频中自由移动物体重建的挑战，特别是在缺乏可靠位姿或深度线索以及任意物体运动的情况下。

Method: 使用双键记忆模块结合潜在外观-几何键和显式方向键，通过空间引导的记忆读取和高效稀疏化机制，将当前帧特征与时间聚合的对象状态稳健融合。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的评估表明，OnlineSplatter显著优于最先进的免位姿重建基线方法，随着观察次数的增加性能持续提升，同时保持恒定的内存和运行时间。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理自由移动物体的重建问题，提供全面而紧凑的对象覆盖，且计算成本不随视频序列长度增加而变化。

Abstract: Free-moving object reconstruction from monocular video remains challenging,
particularly without reliable pose or depth cues and under arbitrary object
motion. We introduce OnlineSplatter, a novel online feed-forward framework
generating high-quality, object-centric 3D Gaussians directly from RGB frames
without requiring camera pose, depth priors, or bundle optimization. Our
approach anchors reconstruction using the first frame and progressively refines
the object representation through a dense Gaussian primitive field, maintaining
constant computational cost regardless of video sequence length. Our core
contribution is a dual-key memory module combining latent appearance-geometry
keys with explicit directional keys, robustly fusing current frame features
with temporally aggregated object states. This design enables effective
handling of free-moving objects via spatial-guided memory readout and an
efficient sparsification mechanism, ensuring comprehensive yet compact object
coverage. Evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that OnlineSplatter
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art pose-free reconstruction baselines,
consistently improving with more observations while maintaining constant memory
and runtime.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SeViCES框架，通过语义-视觉共识证据选择解决长视频理解中的计算效率和推理一致性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频内容复杂多样且时间分散，现有视频大语言模型处理长序列计算成本高，且容易产生不聚焦或不一致的推理结果

Method: 训练无关、模型无关的框架，包含语义-视觉共识帧选择模块（结合时间感知语义分支和聚类引导视觉分支）和答案共识精炼模块

Result: 在长视频理解基准测试中持续优于最先进方法，在准确性和鲁棒性方面表现优异

Conclusion: 共识驱动的证据选择对视频大语言模型至关重要，SeViCES框架能有效提升长视频理解性能

Abstract: Long video understanding remains challenging due to its complex, diverse, and
temporally scattered content. Although video large language models (Video-LLMs)
can process videos lasting tens of minutes, applying them to truly long
sequences is computationally prohibitive and often leads to unfocused or
inconsistent reasoning. A promising solution is to select only the most
informative frames, yet existing approaches typically ignore temporal
dependencies or rely on unimodal evidence, limiting their ability to provide
complete and query-relevant context. We propose a Semantic-Visual Consensus
Evidence Selection (SeViCES) framework for effective and reliable long video
understanding. SeViCES is training-free and model-agnostic, and introduces two
key components. The Semantic-Visual Consensus Frame Selection (SVCFS) module
selects frames through (1) a temporal-aware semantic branch that leverages LLM
reasoning over captions, and (2) a cluster-guided visual branch that aligns
embeddings with semantic scores via mutual information. The Answer Consensus
Refinement (ACR) module further resolves inconsistencies between semantic- and
visual-based predictions by fusing evidence and constraining the answer space.
Extensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks show that SeViCES
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and
robustness, demonstrating the importance of consensus-driven evidence selection
for Video-LLMs.

Abstract: Efficient analysis and processing of dental images are crucial for dentists
to achieve accurate diagnosis and optimal treatment planning. However, dental
imaging inherently poses several challenges, such as low contrast, metallic
artifacts, and variations in projection angles. Combined with the subjectivity
arising from differences in clinicians' expertise, manual interpretation often
proves time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. Artificial intelligence
(AI)-based automated dental image analysis (DIA) offers a promising solution to
these issues and has become an integral part of computer-aided dental diagnosis
and treatment. Among various AI technologies, deep learning (DL) stands out as
the most widely applied and influential approach due to its superior feature
extraction and representation capabilities. To comprehensively summarize recent
progress in this field, we focus on the two fundamental aspects of DL
research-datasets and models. In this paper, we systematically review 260
studies on DL applications in DIA, including 49 papers on publicly available
dental datasets and 211 papers on DL-based algorithms. We first introduce the
basic concepts of dental imaging and summarize the characteristics and
acquisition methods of existing datasets. Then, we present the foundational
techniques of DL and categorize relevant models and algorithms according to
different DIA tasks, analyzing their network architectures, optimization
strategies, training methods, and performance. Furthermore, we summarize
commonly used training and evaluation metrics in the DIA domain. Finally, we
discuss the current challenges of existing research and outline potential
future directions. We hope that this work provides a valuable and systematic
reference for researchers in this field. All supplementary materials and
detailed comparison tables will be made publicly available on GitHub.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BTB3D提出了一种因果卷积编码器-解码器架构，通过频率感知的体素标记化方法，解决了3D医学影像中高分辨率长序列处理的问题，在报告生成和文本到CT合成任务上实现了最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D医学影像的视觉语言模型在处理高分辨率长序列时面临挑战：对比预训练导致视觉编码器与临床语言不对齐，切片级标记化模糊了精细解剖结构，降低了下游任务的诊断性能。

Method: 采用因果卷积编码器-解码器架构，统一2D和3D训练推理，生成紧凑的频率感知体素标记。通过三阶段训练课程：局部重建、重叠窗口平铺和长上下文解码器精炼，使模型能从短切片片段学习并泛化到超过300个切片的扫描。

Result: 在报告生成任务上，BLEU分数提升，临床F1分数比CT2Rep、CT-CHAT和Merlin提高40%；在文本到CT合成任务上，FID降低75%，FVD减半，能生成解剖一致的512*512*241体积数据。

Conclusion: 精确的三维标记化，而不仅仅是更大的语言骨干网络，对于3D医学影像中可扩展的视觉语言建模至关重要。

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language modeling for 3D medical imaging has been
fueled by large-scale computed tomography (CT) corpora with paired free-text
reports, stronger architectures, and powerful pretrained models. This has
enabled applications such as automated report generation and text-conditioned
3D image synthesis. Yet, current approaches struggle with high-resolution,
long-sequence volumes: contrastive pretraining often yields vision encoders
that are misaligned with clinical language, and slice-wise tokenization blurs
fine anatomy, reducing diagnostic performance on downstream tasks. We introduce
BTB3D (Better Tokens for Better 3D), a causal convolutional encoder-decoder
that unifies 2D and 3D training and inference while producing compact,
frequency-aware volumetric tokens. A three-stage training curriculum enables
(i) local reconstruction, (ii) overlapping-window tiling, and (iii)
long-context decoder refinement, during which the model learns from short slice
excerpts yet generalizes to scans exceeding 300 slices without additional
memory overhead. BTB3D sets a new state-of-the-art on two key tasks: it
improves BLEU scores and increases clinical F1 by 40% over CT2Rep, CT-CHAT, and
Merlin for report generation; and it reduces FID by 75% and halves FVD compared
to GenerateCT and MedSyn for text-to-CT synthesis, producing anatomically
consistent 512*512*241 volumes. These results confirm that precise
three-dimensional tokenization, rather than larger language backbones alone, is
essential for scalable vision-language modeling in 3D medical imaging. The

Motivation: 解决超高分辨率文本到图像生成的两个关键挑战：缺乏大规模高质量数据集和针对精细细节合成的专门训练策略。

Method: 1) 构建UltraHR-100K数据集（10万张3K+分辨率图像）；2) 提出频率感知后训练方法，包括细节导向时间步采样(DOTS)和软加权频率正则化(SWFR)。

Result: 在UltraHR-eval4K基准测试中显著提升了超高清图像生成的精细细节质量和整体保真度。

Conclusion: 所提出的数据集和训练方法有效解决了超高分辨率文本到图像生成中的关键问题，显著提升了细节生成质量。

Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution (UHR) text-to-image (T2I) generation has seen notable
progress. However, two key challenges remain : 1) the absence of a large-scale
high-quality UHR T2I dataset, and (2) the neglect of tailored training
strategies for fine-grained detail synthesis in UHR scenarios. To tackle the
first challenge, we introduce \textbf{UltraHR-100K}, a high-quality dataset of
100K UHR images with rich captions, offering diverse content and strong visual
fidelity. Each image exceeds 3K resolution and is rigorously curated based on
detail richness, content complexity, and aesthetic quality. To tackle the
second challenge, we propose a frequency-aware post-training method that
enhances fine-detail generation in T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we
design (i) \textit{Detail-Oriented Timestep Sampling (DOTS)} to focus learning
on detail-critical denoising steps, and (ii) \textit{Soft-Weighting Frequency
Regularization (SWFR)}, which leverages Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to
softly constrain frequency components, encouraging high-frequency detail
preservation. Extensive experiments on our proposed UltraHR-eval4K benchmarks
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the fine-grained detail
quality and overall fidelity of UHR image generation. The code is available at

Abstract: Accurate waste classification is vital for achieving sustainable waste
management and reducing the environmental footprint of urbanization.
Misclassification of recyclable materials contributes to landfill accumulation,
inefficient recycling, and increased greenhouse gas emissions. To address these
issues, this study introduces HybridSOMSpikeNet, a hybrid deep learning
framework that integrates convolutional feature extraction, differentiable
self-organization, and spiking-inspired temporal processing to enable
intelligent and energy-efficient waste classification. The proposed model
employs a pre-trained ResNet-152 backbone to extract deep spatial
representations, followed by a Differentiable Soft Self-Organizing Map
(Soft-SOM) that enhances topological clustering and interpretability. A spiking
neural head accumulates temporal activations over discrete time steps,
improving robustness and generalization. Trained on a ten-class waste dataset,
HybridSOMSpikeNet achieved a test accuracy of 97.39%, outperforming several
state-of-the-art architectures while maintaining a lightweight computational
profile suitable for real-world deployment. Beyond its technical innovations,
the framework provides tangible environmental benefits. By enabling precise and
automated waste segregation, it supports higher recycling efficiency, reduces
contamination in recyclable streams, and minimizes the ecological and
operational costs of waste processing. The approach aligns with global
sustainability priorities, particularly the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals (SDG 11 and SDG 12), by contributing to cleaner cities,
circular economy initiatives, and intelligent environmental management systems.

TL;DR: 提出两种技术来减少多比特量化网络的训练开销：权重偏置校正和比特级核心集采样策略，在保持模型性能的同时将训练时间减少最多7.88倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多比特量化网络方法需要为每个支持的比特宽度重复完整数据集更新，训练成本随精度数量线性增长，且需要额外微调阶段来支持更多精度选项。

Method: 1) 权重偏置校正：通过中性化跨比特宽度的量化诱导偏置和对齐激活分布，实现共享批归一化并消除微调需求；2) 比特级核心集采样策略：利用隐式知识转移现象，通过基于梯度的重要性分数为每个子模型选择紧凑的信息子集进行训练。

Result: 在CIFAR-10/100、TinyImageNet和ImageNet-1K数据集上，使用ResNet和ViT架构的实验表明，该方法在实现竞争性或更优准确率的同时，训练时间最多减少7.88倍。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法显著降低了多比特量化网络的训练开销，同时保持了模型性能，为灵活部署深度神经网络提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-bit quantization networks enable flexible deployment of deep neural
networks by supporting multiple precision levels within a single model.
However, existing approaches suffer from significant training overhead as
full-dataset updates are repeated for each supported bit-width, resulting in a
cost that scales linearly with the number of precisions. Additionally, extra
fine-tuning stages are often required to support additional or intermediate
precision options, further compounding the overall training burden. To address
this issue, we propose two techniques that greatly reduce the training overhead
without compromising model utility: (i) Weight bias correction enables shared
batch normalization and eliminates the need for fine-tuning by neutralizing
quantization-induced bias across bit-widths and aligning activation
distributions; and (ii) Bit-wise coreset sampling strategy allows each child
model to train on a compact, informative subset selected via gradient-based
importance scores by exploiting the implicit knowledge transfer phenomenon.
Experiments on CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-1K with both ResNet and
ViT architectures demonstrate that our method achieves competitive or superior
accuracy while reducing training time up to 7.88x. Our code is released at

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that integrate visual and textual
reasoning leverage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to tackle complex visual
tasks, yet continue to exhibit visual hallucinations and an over-reliance on
textual priors. We present a systematic diagnosis of state-of-the-art
vision-language models using a three-stage evaluation framework, uncovering key
failure modes. To address these, we propose an agent-based architecture that
combines LLM reasoning with lightweight visual modules, enabling fine-grained
analysis and iterative refinement of reasoning chains. Our results highlight
future visual reasoning models should focus on integrating a broader set of
specialized tools for analyzing visual content. Our system achieves significant
gains (+10.3 on MMMU, +6.0 on MathVista over a 7B baseline), matching or
surpassing much larger models. We will release our framework and evaluation
suite to facilitate future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法主要关注保留高重要性KV对来最小化存储，但忽视了多模态KV缓存中出现的模态特定语义冗余模式，这限制了部署可扩展性。

Method: MixKV方法分析KV缓存在不同注意力头中的冗余程度，自适应地平衡多样性和重要性来选择压缩KV对，而不是仅依赖重要性标准。

Result: 在极端压缩条件下（预算=64），MixKV将基线方法平均提升5.1%，在GUI基础任务上对SnapKV和AdaKV分别获得8.0%和9.0%的显著增益，同时保持相当的推理效率。

Conclusion: MixKV通过结合重要性和多样性，有效解决了多模态KV缓存中的语义冗余问题，显著提升了压缩性能，并可无缝扩展到LLMs中。

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in processing extended multi-modal sequences, yet the resulting
key-value (KV) cache expansion creates a critical memory bottleneck that
fundamentally limits deployment scalability. While existing KV cache
compression methods focus on retaining high-importance KV pairs to minimize
storage, they often overlook the modality-specific semantic redundancy patterns
that emerge distinctively in multi-modal KV caches. In this work, we first
analyze how, beyond simple importance, the KV cache in LVLMs exhibits varying
levels of redundancy across attention heads. We show that relying solely on
importance can only cover a subset of the full KV cache information
distribution, leading to potential loss of semantic coverage. To address this,
we propose \texttt{MixKV}, a novel method that mixes importance with diversity
for optimized KV cache compression in LVLMs. \texttt{MixKV} adapts to head-wise
semantic redundancy, selectively balancing diversity and importance when
compressing KV pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{MixKV}
consistently enhances existing methods across multiple LVLMs. Under extreme
compression (budget=64), \texttt{MixKV} improves baseline methods by an average
of \textbf{5.1\%} across five multi-modal understanding benchmarks and achieves
remarkable gains of \textbf{8.0\%} and \textbf{9.0\%} for SnapKV and AdaKV on
GUI grounding tasks, all while maintaining comparable inference efficiency.
Furthermore, \texttt{MixKV} extends seamlessly to LLMs with comparable
performance gains. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LiDAR投影方法存在几何不一致性，导致不可逆的信息丢失，影响高保真应用。需要一种能够实现无损投影的方法来支持高精度遥感应用。

Method: 通过自动逆向工程推断LiDAR传感器的关键参数，包括激光束配置、角度分布和每束激光的校准校正，从而实现无损投影和完整点云重建。

Result: 在KITTI和DurLAR数据集上的全面评估显示，ALICE-LRI实现了完美的点保留，所有点云中零点丢失，几何精度保持在传感器精度范围内，具有实时性能。

Conclusion: 从近似到无损LiDAR投影的范式转变，为需要完整几何保留的高精度遥感应用开辟了新的可能性。

Abstract: 3D LiDAR sensors are essential for autonomous navigation, environmental
monitoring, and precision mapping in remote sensing applications. To
efficiently process the massive point clouds generated by these sensors, LiDAR
data is often projected into 2D range images that organize points by their
angular positions and distances. While these range image representations enable
efficient processing, conventional projection methods suffer from fundamental
geometric inconsistencies that cause irreversible information loss,
compromising high-fidelity applications. We present ALICE-LRI (Automatic LiDAR
Intrinsic Calibration Estimation for Lossless Range Images), the first general,
sensor-agnostic method that achieves lossless range image generation from
spinning LiDAR point clouds without requiring manufacturer metadata or
calibration files. Our algorithm automatically reverse-engineers the intrinsic
geometry of any spinning LiDAR sensor by inferring critical parameters
including laser beam configuration, angular distributions, and per-beam
calibration corrections, enabling lossless projection and complete point cloud
reconstruction with zero point loss. Comprehensive evaluation across the
complete KITTI and DurLAR datasets demonstrates that ALICE-LRI achieves perfect
point preservation, with zero points lost across all point clouds. Geometric
accuracy is maintained well within sensor precision limits, establishing
geometric losslessness with real-time performance. We also present a
compression case study that validates substantial downstream benefits,
demonstrating significant quality improvements in practical applications. This
paradigm shift from approximate to lossless LiDAR projections opens new
possibilities for high-precision remote sensing applications requiring complete
geometric preservation.

*Yuhan Liu,Lianhui Qin,Shengjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Speculative Verdict (SV)框架，通过结合多个轻量级草稿专家和大型裁决模型，在无需训练的情况下解决信息密集型图像的多模态推理问题，实现错误校正和成本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在处理信息密集型图像时面临挑战，这些图像密集交织文本注释和细粒度图形元素，主要困难在于精确定位密集布局中的关键线索和整合分散证据的多跳推理。

Method: 采用受推测解码启发的训练免费框架，包含草稿阶段（小型VLM作为草稿专家生成多样化定位候选的推理路径）和裁决阶段（强大VLM综合这些路径生成最终答案），并引入共识专家选择机制仅转发高一致性推理路径。

Result: 在具有挑战性的信息密集和高分辨率视觉问答基准测试（InfographicVQA、ChartMuseum、ChartQAPro、HR-Bench 4K）上取得一致性能提升。

Conclusion: 通过综合多个部分准确推理路径中的正确见解，SV相比大型专有模型或训练流程实现了错误校正和成本效率。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal understanding, yet they struggle when reasoning over
information-intensive images that densely interleave textual annotations with
fine-grained graphical elements. The main challenges lie in precisely
localizing critical cues in dense layouts and multi-hop reasoning to integrate
dispersed evidence. We propose Speculative Verdict (SV), a training-free
framework inspired by speculative decoding that combines multiple lightweight
draft experts with a large verdict model. In the draft stage, small VLMs act as
draft experts to generate reasoning paths that provide diverse localization
candidates; in the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths to
produce the final answer, minimizing computational cost while recovering
correct answers. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, SV introduces a
consensus expert selection mechanism that forwards only high-agreement
reasoning paths to the verdict. Empirically, SV achieves consistent gains on
challenging information-intensive and high-resolution visual question answering
benchmarks, including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K.
By synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning
paths, SV achieves both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large
proprietary models or training pipelines. Code is available at

TL;DR: AutoScape是一个长时域驾驶场景生成框架，通过RGB-D扩散模型生成几何一致的关键帧，然后使用视频扩散模型插值生成密集连贯的视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长时域驾驶场景生成中几何一致性的挑战，确保生成的视频在长时间范围内保持几何合理性。

Method: 1) 在共享潜在空间中联合处理图像和深度信息；2) 基于先前生成关键帧的几何信息进行条件生成；3) 使用扭曲一致性引导采样过程；4) 通过视频扩散模型在关键帧之间插值。

Result: 生成了超过20秒的真实且几何一致的驾驶视频，在长时域FID和FVD指标上分别比现有最优方法提升了48.6%和43.0%。

Conclusion: AutoScape框架能够有效生成长时域几何一致的驾驶场景视频，在质量和一致性方面显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: This paper proposes AutoScape, a long-horizon driving scene generation
framework. At its core is a novel RGB-D diffusion model that iteratively
generates sparse, geometrically consistent keyframes, serving as reliable
anchors for the scene's appearance and geometry. To maintain long-range
geometric consistency, the model 1) jointly handles image and depth in a shared
latent space, 2) explicitly conditions on the existing scene geometry (i.e.,
rendered point clouds) from previously generated keyframes, and 3) steers the
sampling process with a warp-consistent guidance. Given high-quality RGB-D
keyframes, a video diffusion model then interpolates between them to produce
dense and coherent video frames. AutoScape generates realistic and
geometrically consistent driving videos of over 20 seconds, improving the
long-horizon FID and FVD scores over the prior state-of-the-art by 48.6\% and
43.0\%, respectively.

TL;DR: DyPE是一种无需训练的扩散变换器位置编码方法，能够将预训练模型扩展到远超训练分辨率的高分辨率图像生成，且不增加采样成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器在超高分辨率训练时成本极高，因为自注意力机制随图像token数量呈二次方增长。需要一种方法能让预训练模型生成远超训练分辨率的高质量图像。

Method: 利用扩散过程的频谱特性，在每一步扩散过程中动态调整位置编码的频率谱，使其与当前生成阶段匹配。低频结构早期收敛，高频细节需要更多步骤来解析。

Result: 能够生成1600万像素的超高分辨率图像（使用FLUX模型），在多个基准测试中持续提升性能，在超高分辨率图像生成中达到最先进的保真度。

Conclusion: DyPE是一种有效且高效的方法，能够显著扩展预训练扩散变换器的分辨率能力，在更高分辨率下性能提升更加明显。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer models can generate images with remarkable fidelity and
detail, yet training them at ultra-high resolutions remains extremely costly
due to the self-attention mechanism's quadratic scaling with the number of
image tokens. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Position Extrapolation
(DyPE), a novel, training-free method that enables pre-trained diffusion
transformers to synthesize images at resolutions far beyond their training
data, with no additional sampling cost. DyPE takes advantage of the spectral
progression inherent to the diffusion process, where low-frequency structures
converge early, while high-frequencies take more steps to resolve.
Specifically, DyPE dynamically adjusts the model's positional encoding at each
diffusion step, matching their frequency spectrum with the current stage of the
generative process. This approach allows us to generate images at resolutions
that exceed the training resolution dramatically, e.g., 16 million pixels using
FLUX. On multiple benchmarks, DyPE consistently improves performance and
achieves state-of-the-art fidelity in ultra-high-resolution image generation,
with gains becoming even more pronounced at higher resolutions. Project page is

TL;DR: α-Flow是一个统一的生成模型目标函数家族，通过课程学习策略从轨迹流匹配平滑过渡到MeanFlow，解决了优化冲突问题，在ImageNet-1K 256x256上实现了新的SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现MeanFlow目标函数中的轨迹流匹配和轨迹一致性项存在强负相关性，导致优化冲突和收敛缓慢，需要设计新的目标函数来解耦这些冲突目标。

Method: 提出α-Flow目标函数家族，统一了轨迹流匹配、Shortcut Model和MeanFlow，采用课程学习策略从轨迹流匹配平滑过渡到MeanFlow。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K 256x256上，α-Flow在不同规模和设置下均优于MeanFlow，最大的α-Flow-XL/2+模型使用标准DiT骨干网络实现了FID 2.58（1步）和2.15（2步）的新SOTA结果。

Conclusion: α-Flow通过解耦冲突目标实现了更好的收敛性能，为少步生成建模提供了有效的训练框架。

Abstract: MeanFlow has recently emerged as a powerful framework for few-step generative
modeling trained from scratch, but its success is not yet fully understood. In
this work, we show that the MeanFlow objective naturally decomposes into two
parts: trajectory flow matching and trajectory consistency. Through gradient
analysis, we find that these terms are strongly negatively correlated, causing
optimization conflict and slow convergence. Motivated by these insights, we
introduce $\alpha$-Flow, a broad family of objectives that unifies trajectory
flow matching, Shortcut Model, and MeanFlow under one formulation. By adopting
a curriculum strategy that smoothly anneals from trajectory flow matching to
MeanFlow, $\alpha$-Flow disentangles the conflicting objectives, and achieves
better convergence. When trained from scratch on class-conditional ImageNet-1K
256x256 with vanilla DiT backbones, $\alpha$-Flow consistently outperforms
MeanFlow across scales and settings. Our largest $\alpha$-Flow-XL/2+ model
achieves new state-of-the-art results using vanilla DiT backbones, with FID
scores of 2.58 (1-NFE) and 2.15 (2-NFE).

TL;DR: Cupid是一种新的基于生成的3D重建方法，能从单张2D图像准确推断相机姿态、3D形状和纹理，通过两阶段流匹配流程实现联合生成体素和像素-体素对应关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从单张2D图像进行3D重建的挑战，特别是在相机姿态未知的情况下，实现姿态、形状和纹理的联合准确估计。

Method: 将3D重建建模为条件采样过程，采用两阶段流匹配：粗阶段生成初始3D几何和2D投影用于姿态恢复，精阶段集成姿态对齐的图像特征以增强结构保真度和外观细节。

Result: 在广泛实验中，Cupid在PSNR上获得超过3dB的提升，Chamfer距离减少超过10%，在姿态精度上匹配单目估计器，在视觉保真度上优于基线3D生成模型。

Conclusion: Cupid通过统一的生成框架实现了从单张图像的鲁棒3D重建，在多个指标上显著优于现有领先方法。

Abstract: This work proposes a new generation-based 3D reconstruction method, named
Cupid, that accurately infers the camera pose, 3D shape, and texture of an
object from a single 2D image. Cupid casts 3D reconstruction as a conditional
sampling process from a learned distribution of 3D objects, and it jointly
generates voxels and pixel-voxel correspondences, enabling robust pose and
shape estimation under a unified generative framework. By representing both
input camera poses and 3D shape as a distribution in a shared 3D latent space,
Cupid adopts a two-stage flow matching pipeline: (1) a coarse stage that
produces initial 3D geometry with associated 2D projections for pose recovery;
and (2) a refinement stage that integrates pose-aligned image features to
enhance structural fidelity and appearance details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate Cupid outperforms leading 3D reconstruction methods with an over 3
dB PSNR gain and an over 10% Chamfer Distance reduction, while matching
monocular estimators on pose accuracy and delivering superior visual fidelity
over baseline 3D generative models. For an immersive view of the 3D results

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究往往低估雷达的作用，仅将其作为辅助传感器，而雷达能够提供精确的目标距离/深度信息。本文旨在充分发挥雷达的关键作用，简化雷达与相机检测结果的融合过程。

Method: 开发了雷达-相机融合MOT框架，利用在线雷达-相机标定技术；使用雷达和相机数据的共同特征来准确推导检测对象的真实世界位置；采用特征匹配和类别一致性检查来超越单纯位置匹配的限制。

Result: 在受控环境和实际交通场景中的实验证明，该框架能够简化雷达-相机映射过程并提高跟踪精度。

Conclusion: 这是首个研究雷达-相机共同特征集成及其在在线标定中用于实现MOT的工作，展示了通过传感器融合提升多目标跟踪性能的有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents a Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) framework that fuses radar
and camera data to enhance tracking efficiency while minimizing manual
interventions. Contrary to many studies that underutilize radar and assign it a
supplementary role--despite its capability to provide accurate range/depth
information of targets in a world 3D coordinate system--our approach positions
radar in a crucial role. Meanwhile, this paper utilizes common features to
enable online calibration to autonomously associate detections from radar and
camera. The main contributions of this work include: (1) the development of a
radar-camera fusion MOT framework that exploits online radar-camera calibration
to simplify the integration of detection results from these two sensors, (2)
the utilization of common features between radar and camera data to accurately
derive real-world positions of detected objects, and (3) the adoption of
feature matching and category-consistency checking to surpass the limitations
of mere position matching in enhancing sensor association accuracy. To the best
of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the integration of
radar-camera common features and their use in online calibration for achieving
MOT. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated by its ability to streamline
the radar-camera mapping process and improve tracking precision, as evidenced
by real-world experiments conducted in both controlled environments and actual
traffic scenarios. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出ARGenSeg框架，通过自回归生成方式实现图像分割，将多模态理解与像素级感知统一在单一框架中，显著提升推理速度并保持强大理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用边界点表示或专用分割头，依赖离散表示或语义提示，限制了MLLM捕捉细粒度视觉细节的能力。

Method: 基于图像生成的分割框架，利用MLLM输出视觉token，通过通用VQ-VAE解码为图像，采用下一尺度预测策略并行生成视觉token以减少推理延迟。

Result: 在多个分割数据集上超越先前最先进方法，推理速度显著提升。

Conclusion: ARGenSeg成功将图像分割整合到MLLM中，实现了多模态理解与像素级感知的统一，为密集视觉任务提供了新范式。

Abstract: We propose a novel AutoRegressive Generation-based paradigm for image
Segmentation (ARGenSeg), achieving multimodal understanding and pixel-level
perception within a unified framework. Prior works integrating image
segmentation into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically employ
either boundary points representation or dedicated segmentation heads. These
methods rely on discrete representations or semantic prompts fed into
task-specific decoders, which limits the ability of the MLLM to capture
fine-grained visual details. To address these challenges, we introduce a
segmentation framework for MLLM based on image generation, which naturally
produces dense masks for target objects. We leverage MLLM to output visual
tokens and detokenize them into images using an universal VQ-VAE, making the
segmentation fully dependent on the pixel-level understanding of the MLLM. To
reduce inference latency, we employ a next-scale-prediction strategy to
generate required visual tokens in parallel. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses prior state-of-the-art approaches on multiple
segmentation datasets with a remarkable boost in inference speed, while
maintaining strong understanding capabilities.

<details>

Motivation: 受自回归大语言模型启发，将Transformer架构应用于视频预测领域，特别关注物理模拟的时间因果建模这一现有视频生成方法的常见短板

Method: 采用纯Transformer架构进行自回归视频预测，比较不同时空自注意力布局，使用连续像素空间表示，无需复杂训练策略或潜在特征学习组件

Result: 在物理模拟数据集上，相比现有潜在空间方法，物理准确预测的时间跨度显著延长50%，同时在常规视频质量指标上保持可比性能

Conclusion: 该方法为基于注意力的时空视频建模提供了一个简单、参数高效且可解释的平台，通过探测实验发现网络能够泛化到分布外模拟参数的估计

Abstract: Inspired by the performance and scalability of autoregressive large language
models (LLMs), transformer-based models have seen recent success in the visual
domain. This study investigates a transformer adaptation for video prediction
with a simple end-to-end approach, comparing various spatiotemporal
self-attention layouts. Focusing on causal modeling of physical simulations
over time; a common shortcoming of existing video-generative approaches, we
attempt to isolate spatiotemporal reasoning via physical object tracking
metrics and unsupervised training on physical simulation datasets. We introduce
a simple yet effective pure transformer model for autoregressive video
prediction, utilizing continuous pixel-space representations for video
prediction. Without the need for complex training strategies or latent
feature-learning components, our approach significantly extends the time
horizon for physically accurate predictions by up to 50% when compared with
existing latent-space approaches, while maintaining comparable performance on
common video quality metrics. In addition, we conduct interpretability
experiments to identify network regions that encode information useful to
perform accurate estimations of PDE simulation parameters via probing models,
and find that this generalizes to the estimation of out-of-distribution
simulation parameters. This work serves as a platform for further
attention-based spatiotemporal modeling of videos via a simple, parameter
efficient, and interpretable approach.

TL;DR: SpectraMorph是一个基于物理指导的自监督高光谱超分辨率框架，通过解混瓶颈和线性混合重建光谱，在MSI波段极少的情况下仍保持鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法缺乏可解释性，且在MSI波段很少时容易失效。需要开发既保持高性能又具有解释性的融合方法。

Method: 采用解混瓶颈：从低分辨率HSI提取端元特征，用紧凑MLP从MSI预测丰度图，通过线性混合重建光谱，使用MSI传感器光谱响应函数进行自监督训练。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，SpectraMorph始终优于最先进的无监督/自监督基线，与监督基线相比也很有竞争力，训练时间不到1分钟。

Conclusion: SpectraMorph提供了解释性中间结果，在MSI波段极少时仍保持鲁棒性，为高光谱超分辨率提供了有效的物理指导自监督解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral sensors capture dense spectra per pixel but suffer from low
spatial resolution, causing blurred boundaries and mixed-pixel effects.
Co-registered companion sensors such as multispectral, RGB, or panchromatic
cameras provide high-resolution spatial detail, motivating hyperspectral
super-resolution through the fusion of hyperspectral and multispectral images
(HSI-MSI). Existing deep learning based methods achieve strong performance but
rely on opaque regressors that lack interpretability and often fail when the
MSI has very few bands. We propose SpectraMorph, a physics-guided
self-supervised fusion framework with a structured latent space. Instead of
direct regression, SpectraMorph enforces an unmixing bottleneck: endmember
signatures are extracted from the low-resolution HSI, and a compact multilayer
perceptron predicts abundance-like maps from the MSI. Spectra are reconstructed
by linear mixing, with training performed in a self-supervised manner via the
MSI sensor's spectral response function. SpectraMorph produces interpretable
intermediates, trains in under a minute, and remains robust even with a
single-band (pan-chromatic) MSI. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets show SpectraMorph consistently outperforming state-of-the-art
unsupervised/self-supervised baselines while remaining very competitive against
supervised baselines.

Motivation: 扩散模型在单模态领域表现出色，但在跨模态转换方面存在挑战。现有方法受到共享维度、高斯先验和模态特定架构等限制性假设的约束。

Method: 在共享潜在空间中学习任意模态之间的桥接，使用对比对齐损失确保语义一致性，设计域无关的编码器-解码器架构进行潜在空间噪声预测，并提出预测损失指导训练。

Conclusion: LDDBM为通用模态转换建立了新的强基线，支持任意模态对，并通过综合实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have positioned diffusion models as
state-of-the-art tools for sampling from complex data distributions. While
these models have shown remarkable success across single-modality domains such
as images and audio, extending their capabilities to Modality Translation (MT),
translating information across different sensory modalities, remains an open
challenge. Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, including
shared dimensionality, Gaussian source priors, and modality-specific
architectures, which limit their generality and theoretical grounding. In this
work, we propose the Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM), a
general-purpose framework for modality translation based on a latent-variable
extension of Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models. By operating in a shared latent
space, our method learns a bridge between arbitrary modalities without
requiring aligned dimensions. We introduce a contrastive alignment loss to
enforce semantic consistency between paired samples and design a
domain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture tailored for noise prediction in
latent space. Additionally, we propose a predictive loss to guide training
toward accurate cross-domain translation and explore several training
strategies to improve stability. Our approach supports arbitrary modality pairs
and performs strongly on diverse MT tasks, including multi-view to 3D shape
generation, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis.
Comprehensive experiments and ablations validate the effectiveness of our
framework, establishing a new strong baseline in general modality translation.

TL;DR: LayerComposer是一个用于个性化多主体文本到图像生成的交互式框架，通过分层画布和锁定机制实现空间组合控制和身份保持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有个性化生成模型缺乏对空间组合的交互控制，且难以扩展到多主体场景。

Method: 引入分层画布表示，每个主体位于独立层；采用锁定机制保持选定层的高保真度，同时允许其他层灵活适应上下文；无需架构改动，利用位置嵌入和互补数据采样策略。

Result: 在个性化多主体图像生成中，相比现有最优方法，LayerComposer实现了更优越的空间控制和身份保持。

Conclusion: LayerComposer通过分层画布和锁定机制，为多主体个性化图像生成提供了有效的交互控制和身份保持解决方案。

Abstract: Despite their impressive visual fidelity, existing personalized generative
models lack interactive control over spatial composition and scale poorly to
multiple subjects. To address these limitations, we present LayerComposer, an
interactive framework for personalized, multi-subject text-to-image generation.
Our approach introduces two main contributions: (1) a layered canvas, a novel
representation in which each subject is placed on a distinct layer, enabling
occlusion-free composition; and (2) a locking mechanism that preserves selected
layers with high fidelity while allowing the remaining layers to adapt flexibly
to the surrounding context. Similar to professional image-editing software, the
proposed layered canvas allows users to place, resize, or lock input subjects
through intuitive layer manipulation. Our versatile locking mechanism requires
no architectural changes, relying instead on inherent positional embeddings
combined with a new complementary data sampling strategy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that LayerComposer achieves superior spatial control and identity
preservation compared to the state-of-the-art methods in multi-subject
personalized image generation.

TL;DR: HoloCine是一个文本到视频生成模型，通过整体生成整个场景来解决现有模型在创建连贯多镜头叙事方面的不足，实现了从剪辑合成到自动化电影制作的关键转变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文本到视频模型在生成连贯多镜头叙事方面的"叙事鸿沟"，这些模型擅长生成孤立片段但无法创建具有全局一致性的多镜头故事。

Method: 采用窗口交叉注意力机制将文本提示定位到特定镜头，以及稀疏镜头间自注意力模式（镜头内密集、镜头间稀疏），确保分钟级生成的效率。

Result: 在叙事连贯性方面达到新的最先进水平，并展现出显著的新兴能力：对角色和场景的持久记忆，以及对电影技术的直观理解。

Conclusion: 这项工作标志着从剪辑合成向自动化电影制作的关键转变，使端到端的电影创作成为可实现的未来。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-video models excel at generating isolated clips but
fall short of creating the coherent, multi-shot narratives, which are the
essence of storytelling. We bridge this "narrative gap" with HoloCine, a model
that generates entire scenes holistically to ensure global consistency from the
first shot to the last. Our architecture achieves precise directorial control
through a Window Cross-Attention mechanism that localizes text prompts to
specific shots, while a Sparse Inter-Shot Self-Attention pattern (dense within
shots but sparse between them) ensures the efficiency required for minute-scale
generation. Beyond setting a new state-of-the-art in narrative coherence,
HoloCine develops remarkable emergent abilities: a persistent memory for
characters and scenes, and an intuitive grasp of cinematic techniques. Our work
marks a pivotal shift from clip synthesis towards automated filmmaking, making
end-to-end cinematic creation a tangible future. Our code is available at:
