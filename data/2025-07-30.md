Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究使用词嵌入方法、自然语言处理技术和机器学习算法对书籍摘要和分类进行分类，并比较了不同方法的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在土耳其文本中，不同词嵌入方法和机器学习算法的效果，以找到最适合的分类方法。

Method: 采用One Hot Encoding、Word2Vec和TF-IDF等词嵌入方法，结合支持向量机、朴素贝叶斯和逻辑回归模型进行分类。

Result: 支持向量机、朴素贝叶斯和逻辑回归模型结合TF-IDF和One-Hot Encoder在土耳其文本中表现更优。

Conclusion: TF-IDF和One-Hot Encoder与特定机器学习模型结合在土耳其文本分类中效果最佳。

Abstract: In this study, book summaries and categories taken from book sites were
classified using word embedding methods, natural language processing techniques
and machine learning algorithms. In addition, one hot encoding, Word2Vec and
Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) methods, which are
frequently used word embedding methods were used in this study and their
success was compared. Additionally, the combination table of the pre-processing
methods used is shown and added to the table. Looking at the results, it was
observed that Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression
Models and TF-IDF and One-Hot Encoder word embedding techniques gave more
successful results for Turkish texts.

### [2] [Dialogic Social Learning for Artificial Agents: Enhancing LLM Ontology Acquisition through Mixed-Initiative Educational Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21065)
*Sabrina Patania,Luca Annese,Cansu Koyuturk,Azzurra Ruggeri,Dimitri Ognibene*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了通过社会中介学习范式（如AI Social Gym）提升大语言模型（LLMs）在线知识获取能力的方法，发现双向对话教学策略显著优于传统单向教学或直接知识访问。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI训练方法依赖大规模数据集和稀疏反馈，限制了模型从交互中高效学习的能力。受维果茨基社会文化理论启发，研究探索社会中介学习如何弥补这一缺陷。

Method: 研究设计了'AI Social Gym'环境，其中AI学习者与知识丰富的AI教师进行双向教学对话，重点考察不同教学策略对本体知识获取的影响。

Result: 实验表明，双向互动（结合自上而下解释与学习者提问）显著提升LLMs的知识获取与应用能力，优于单向教学或直接知识访问。

Conclusion: 将教学和心理洞察融入AI训练可显著提升知识获取与响应质量，为现有策略（如提示工程）提供了补充路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
processing extensive offline datasets. However, they often face challenges in
acquiring and integrating complex, knowledge online. Traditional AI training
paradigms, predominantly based on supervised learning or reinforcement
learning, mirror a 'Piagetian' model of independent exploration. These
approaches typically rely on large datasets and sparse feedback signals,
limiting the models' ability to learn efficiently from interactions. Drawing
inspiration from Vygotsky's sociocultural theory, this study explores the
potential of socially mediated learning paradigms to address these limitations.
  We introduce a dynamic environment, termed the 'AI Social Gym', where an AI
learner agent engages in dyadic pedagogical dialogues with knowledgeable AI
teacher agents. These interactions emphasize external, structured dialogue as a
core mechanism for knowledge acquisition, contrasting with methods that depend
solely on internal inference or pattern recognition.
  Our investigation focuses on how different pedagogical strategies impact the
AI learning process in the context of ontology acquisition. Empirical results
indicate that such dialogic approaches-particularly those involving
mixed-direction interactions combining top-down explanations with
learner-initiated questioning-significantly enhance the LLM's ability to
acquire and apply new knowledge, outperforming both unidirectional
instructional methods and direct access to structured knowledge, formats
typically present in training datasets.
  These findings suggest that integrating pedagogical and psychological
insights into AI and robot training can substantially improve post-training
knowledge acquisition and response quality. This approach offers a
complementary pathway to existing strategies like prompt engineering

### [3] [Product vs. Process: Exploring EFL Students' Editing of AI-Generated Text for Expository Writing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21073)
*David James Woo,Yangyang Yu,Kai Guo,Yilin Huang,April Ka Yeng Fung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了EFL中学生如何编辑AI生成的文本，发现编辑行为对写作质量影响有限，AI支持但不替代写作技能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成的文本在EFL写作中应用增多，但其对学生写作过程和成果的影响尚不明确。

Method: 采用混合方法分析39名香港中学生的屏幕记录和作文，包括定性编码、统计分析等。

Result: AI生成字数对评分有正面影响，但编辑行为对质量提升作用有限。

Conclusion: 需加强体裁指导和过程写作，评估应重视过程与成果，以促进学生对AI文本的批判性使用。

Abstract: Text generated by artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots is increasingly used
in English as a foreign language (EFL) writing contexts, yet its impact on
students' expository writing process and compositions remains understudied.
This research examines how EFL secondary students edit AI-generated text.
Exploring editing behaviors in their expository writing process and in
expository compositions, and their effect on human-rated scores for content,
organization, language, and overall quality. Participants were 39 Hong Kong
secondary students who wrote an expository composition with AI chatbots in a
workshop. A convergent design was employed to analyze their screen recordings
and compositions to examine students' editing behaviors and writing qualities.
Analytical methods included qualitative coding, descriptive statistics,
temporal sequence analysis, human-rated scoring, and multiple linear regression
analysis. We analyzed over 260 edits per dataset, and identified two editing
patterns: one where students refined introductory units repeatedly before
progressing, and another where they quickly shifted to extensive edits in body
units (e.g., topic and supporting sentences). MLR analyses revealed that the
number of AI-generated words positively predicted all score dimensions, while
most editing variables showed minimal impact. These results suggest a
disconnect between students' significant editing effort and improved
composition quality, indicating AI supports but does not replace writing
skills. The findings highlight the importance of genre-specific instruction and
process-focused writing before AI integration. Educators should also develop
assessments valuing both process and product to encourage critical engagement
with AI text.

### [4] [Which symbol grounding problem should we try to solve?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21080)
*Vincent C. Müller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Floridi和Taddeo提出了解决基础问题的'零语义承诺'条件及其解决方案，但作者认为该条件无法实现，包括他们自己的方案。通过对比Luc Steels的建议，作者提出需要重新思考问题的本质及系统中'目标'的作用。基于对计算的正确理解，作者认为唯一有意义的基础问题是如何解释和重现人工计算代理中意义的行为能力和功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Floridi和Taddeo提出的'零语义承诺'条件及其解决方案的可行性，并重新思考基础问题的本质。

Method: 分析Floridi和Taddeo的方案，对比Luc Steels的建议，并基于对计算的理解提出新观点。

Result: Floridi和Taddeo的条件无法实现，基础问题应重新定义为解释和重现人工计算代理中意义的行为能力。

Conclusion: 唯一有意义的基础问题是如何解释和重现人工计算代理中意义的行为能力和功能。

Abstract: Floridi and Taddeo propose a condition of "zero semantic commitment" for
solutions to the grounding problem, and a solution to it. I argue briefly that
their condition cannot be fulfilled, not even by their own solution. After a
look at Luc Steels' very different competing suggestion, I suggest that we need
to re-think what the problem is and what role the 'goals' in a system play in
formulating the problem. On the basis of a proper understanding of computing, I
come to the conclusion that the only sensible grounding problem is how we can
explain and re-produce the behavioral ability and function of meaning in
artificial computational agents

### [5] [ChatGPT Reads Your Tone and Responds Accordingly -- Until It Does Not -- Emotional Framing Induces Bias in LLM Outputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21083)
*Franck Bardol*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现GPT-4对负面情绪问题的回应比中性问题少三倍，表现出“反弹”偏差，倾向于中立或积极回应，尤其在敏感话题上更明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（如GPT-4）如何根据问题的情感语调调整回应，揭示潜在的偏差及其对AI对齐和信任的影响。

Method: 通过系统性地改变156个提示的情感语调（涵盖争议性和日常话题），分析模型回应的变化，并使用1536维嵌入可视化语义漂移。

Result: GPT-4对负面问题的负面回应概率显著低于中性问题，敏感话题中语调变化的影响被抑制，表明存在对齐覆盖。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了由情感框架驱动的未充分探索的偏差类别，对AI对齐和信任具有重要启示。

Abstract: Large Language Models like GPT-4 adjust their responses not only based on the
question asked, but also on how it is emotionally phrased. We systematically
vary the emotional tone of 156 prompts - spanning controversial and everyday
topics - and analyze how it affects model responses. Our findings show that
GPT-4 is three times less likely to respond negatively to a negatively framed
question than to a neutral one. This suggests a "rebound" bias where the model
overcorrects, often shifting toward neutrality or positivity. On sensitive
topics (e.g., justice or politics), this effect is even more pronounced:
tone-based variation is suppressed, suggesting an alignment override. We
introduce concepts like the "tone floor" - a lower bound in response negativity
- and use tone-valence transition matrices to quantify behavior. Visualizations
based on 1536-dimensional embeddings confirm semantic drift based on tone. Our
work highlights an underexplored class of biases driven by emotional framing in
prompts, with implications for AI alignment and trust. Code and data are
available at: https://github.com/bardolfranck/llm-responses-viewer

### [6] [Reviving Your MNEME: Predicting The Side Effects of LLM Unlearning and Fine-Tuning via Sparse Model Diffing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21084)
*Aly M. Kassem,Zhuan Shi,Negar Rostamzadeh,Golnoosh Farnadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MNEME框架通过稀疏模型差异分析检测LLM微调或遗忘后的意外副作用，无需微调数据，准确率达95%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法无法检测微调或遗忘后的意外副作用，如跨任务性能下降。

Method: MNEME通过任务无关数据比较基础模型与微调模型，使用稀疏模型差异分析识别行为变化。

Result: 在五种LLM和三种场景中，MNEME预测副作用的准确率达95%，且可通过高激活样本部分逆转效果。

Conclusion: 稀疏探测和差异分析为理解和管理LLM行为提供了可扩展的自动化工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are frequently fine-tuned or unlearned to adapt
to new tasks or eliminate undesirable behaviors. While existing evaluation
methods assess performance after such interventions, there remains no general
approach for detecting unintended side effects, such as unlearning biology
content degrading performance on chemistry tasks, particularly when these
effects are unpredictable or emergent. To address this issue, we introduce
MNEME, Model diffiNg for Evaluating Mechanistic Effects, a lightweight
framework for identifying these side effects using sparse model diffing. MNEME
compares base and fine-tuned models on task-agnostic data (for example, The
Pile, LMSYS-Chat-1M) without access to fine-tuning data to isolate behavioral
shifts. Applied to five LLMs across three scenarios: WMDP knowledge unlearning,
emergent misalignment, and benign fine-tuning, MNEME achieves up to 95 percent
accuracy in predicting side effects, aligning with known benchmarks and
requiring no custom heuristics. Furthermore, we show that retraining on
high-activation samples can partially reverse these effects. Our results
demonstrate that sparse probing and diffing offer a scalable and automated lens
into fine-tuning-induced model changes, providing practical tools for
understanding and managing LLM behavior.

### [7] [Multi-Amateur Contrastive Decoding for Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21086)
*Jaydip Sen,Subhasis Dasgupta,Hetvi Waghela*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多业余模型对比解码（MACD）方法，通过集成多个业余模型来更全面地捕捉语言生成中的失败模式，提升了文本生成的流畅性、连贯性和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然对比解码（CD）能提升文本生成的连贯性和流畅性，但其依赖单一业余模型限制了其对多样化失败模式的捕捉能力。

Method: MACD通过集成多个业余模型，采用平均和共识惩罚机制整合对比信号，并扩展了多业余场景下的合理性约束。

Result: 实验表明，MACD在新闻、百科和叙事等多个领域均优于传统解码方法和原始CD方法。

Conclusion: MACD无需额外训练或微调，即可显著提升文本生成的质量和可控性。

Abstract: Contrastive Decoding (CD) has emerged as an effective inference-time strategy
for enhancing open-ended text generation by exploiting the divergence in output
probabilities between a large expert language model and a smaller amateur
model. Although CD improves coherence and fluency, its dependence on a single
amateur restricts its capacity to capture the diverse and multifaceted failure
modes of language generation, such as repetition, hallucination, and stylistic
drift. This paper proposes Multi-Amateur Contrastive Decoding (MACD), a
generalization of the CD framework that employs an ensemble of amateur models
to more comprehensively characterize undesirable generation patterns. MACD
integrates contrastive signals through both averaging and consensus
penalization mechanisms and extends the plausibility constraint to operate
effectively in the multi-amateur setting. Furthermore, the framework enables
controllable generation by incorporating amateurs with targeted stylistic or
content biases. Experimental results across multiple domains, such as news,
encyclopedic, and narrative, demonstrate that MACD consistently surpasses
conventional decoding methods and the original CD approach in terms of fluency,
coherence, diversity, and adaptability, all without requiring additional
training or fine-tuning.

### [8] [QU-NLP at CheckThat! 2025: Multilingual Subjectivity in News Articles Detection using Feature-Augmented Transformer Models with Sequential Cross-Lingual Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21095)
*Mohammad AL-Smadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合预训练语言模型与统计和语言特征的方法，用于检测新闻句子中的主观性，并在多语言和零样本设置中取得了竞争性表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决新闻文章中句子主观性检测的挑战，区分作者主观观点与客观事实。

Method: 采用特征增强的Transformer架构，结合预训练模型的上下文嵌入与统计和语言特征，如TF-IDF和词性标签。

Result: 在多种语言（英语、阿拉伯语、德语、意大利语等）的单语和多语设置中表现优异，特别是在零样本设置中取得领先排名。

Conclusion: 结合TF-IDF特征与门控机制以及跨语言迁移对主观性检测至关重要，模型的性能受跨语言微调顺序和训练语言的语言接近性影响。

Abstract: This paper presents our approach to the CheckThat! 2025 Task 1 on
subjectivity detection, where systems are challenged to distinguish whether a
sentence from a news article expresses the subjective view of the author or
presents an objective view on the covered topic. We propose a feature-augmented
transformer architecture that combines contextual embeddings from pre-trained
language models with statistical and linguistic features. Our system leveraged
pre-trained transformers with additional lexical features: for Arabic we used
AraELECTRA augmented with part-of-speech (POS) tags and TF-IDF features, while
for the other languages we fine-tuned a cross-lingual DeBERTa~V3 model combined
with TF-IDF features through a gating mechanism. We evaluated our system in
monolingual, multilingual, and zero-shot settings across multiple languages
including English, Arabic, German, Italian, and several unseen languages. The
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving competitive
performance across different languages with notable success in the monolingual
setting for English (rank 1st with macro-F1=0.8052), German (rank 3rd with
macro-F1=0.8013), Arabic (rank 4th with macro-F1=0.5771), and Romanian (rank
1st with macro-F1=0.8126) in the zero-shot setting. We also conducted an
ablation analysis that demonstrated the importance of combining TF-IDF features
with the gating mechanism and the cross-lingual transfer for subjectivity
detection. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the model's sensitivity to both
the order of cross-lingual fine-tuning and the linguistic proximity of the
training languages.

### [9] [Rewrite-to-Rank: Optimizing Ad Visibility via Retrieval-Aware Text Rewriting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21099)
*Chloe Ho,Ishneet Sukhvinder Singh,Diya Sharma,Tanvi Reddy Anumandla,Michael Lu,Vasu Sharma,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何通过LLM重写广告内容来提升其在检索系统和生成响应中的排名和可见性，提出了一种监督微调框架和两种评估指标，实验表明PPO训练模型优于其他方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索广告内容措辞对检索系统排名和LLM生成响应中广告可见性的影响，提出一种无需修改检索模型的优化方法。

Method: 引入监督微调框架，结合语义相关性和内容保真度的自定义损失函数，并提出DeltaMRR@K和DeltaDIR@K两种评估指标。

Result: 实验显示，PPO训练模型在大多数情况下优于提示工程和监督微调，最高提升2.79 DeltaDIR@5和0.0073 DeltaMRR@5。

Conclusion: 广告措辞、提示格式和强化学习在LLM集成检索系统中对广告重写的效果至关重要。

Abstract: Search algorithms and user query relevance have given LLMs the ability to
return relevant information, but the effect of content phrasing on ad
visibility remains underexplored. We investigate how LLM-based rewriting of
advertisements can improve their ranking in retrieval systems and inclusion in
generated LLM responses, without modifying the retrieval model itself. We
introduce a supervised fine-tuning framework with a custom loss balancing
semantic relevance and content fidelity. To evaluate effectiveness, we propose
two metrics: DeltaMRR@K (ranking improvement) and DeltaDIR@K (inclusion
frequency improvement). Our approach presents a scalable method to optimize ad
phrasing, enhancing visibility in retrieval-based LLM workflows. Experiments
across both instruction-based and few-shot prompting demonstrate that PPO
trained models outperform both prompt engineering and supervised fine-tuning in
most cases, achieving up to a 2.79 DeltaDIR@5 and 0.0073 DeltaMRR@5 in
instruction-based prompting. These results highlight the importance of how the
ad is written before retrieval and prompt format and reinforcement learning in
effective ad rewriting for LLM integrated retrieval systems.

Abstract: Automatic sign language translation has gained particular interest in the
computer vision and computational linguistics communities in recent years.
Given each sign language country particularities, machine translation requires
local data to develop new techniques and adapt existing ones. This work
presents iLSU T, an open dataset of interpreted Uruguayan Sign Language RGB
videos with audio and text transcriptions. This type of multimodal and curated
data is paramount for developing novel approaches to understand or generate
tools for sign language processing. iLSU T comprises more than 185 hours of
interpreted sign language videos from public TV broadcasting. It covers diverse
topics and includes the participation of 18 professional interpreters of sign
language. A series of experiments using three state of the art translation
algorithms is presented. The aim is to establish a baseline for this dataset
and evaluate its usefulness and the proposed pipeline for data processing. The
experiments highlight the need for more localized datasets for sign language
translation and understanding, which are critical for developing novel tools to
improve accessibility and inclusion of all individuals. Our data and code can
be accessed.

### [11] [Creation of a Numerical Scoring System to Objectively Measure and Compare the Level of Rhetoric in Arabic Texts: A Feasibility Study, and A Working Prototype](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21106)
*Mandar Marathe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究旨在开发一种量化阿拉伯修辞密度的方法，通过识别和计算文本中的文学手法，为阿拉伯修辞提供客观测量工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管阿拉伯修辞历史悠久且备受重视，但缺乏客观方法衡量其在文本中的使用程度和分布。

Method: 研究编制了84种常见文学手法的清单，构建了识别系统，并基于词素计数计算密度，开发了电子和模拟工具。

Result: 成功创建了一套工具，可准确报告阿拉伯文本或演讲中的修辞密度及其分布。

Conclusion: 该工具填补了阿拉伯修辞量化研究的空白，为跨类型、作者或时代的比较提供了可能。

Abstract: Arabic Rhetoric is the field of Arabic linguistics which governs the art and
science of conveying a message with greater beauty, impact and persuasiveness.
The field is as ancient as the Arabic language itself and is found extensively
in classical and contemporary Arabic poetry, free verse and prose. In practical
terms, it is the intelligent use of word order, figurative speech and
linguistic embellishments to enhance message delivery. Despite the volumes that
have been written about it and the high status accorded to it, there is no way
to objectively know whether a speaker or writer has used Arabic rhetoric in a
given text, to what extent, and why. There is no objective way to compare the
use of Arabic rhetoric across genres, authors or epochs. It is impossible to
know which of pre-Islamic poetry, Andalucian Arabic poetry, or modern literary
genres are richer in Arabic rhetoric. The aim of the current study was to
devise a way to measure the density of the literary devices which constitute
Arabic rhetoric in a given text, as a proxy marker for Arabic rhetoric itself.
A comprehensive list of 84 of the commonest literary devices and their
definitions was compiled. A system of identifying literary devices in texts was
constructed. A method of calculating the density of literary devices based on
the morpheme count of the text was utilised. Four electronic tools and an
analogue tool were created to support the calculation of an Arabic text's
rhetorical literary device density, including a website and online calculator.
Additionally, a technique of reporting the distribution of literary devices
used across the three sub-domains of Arabic rhetoric was created. The output of
this project is a working tool which can accurately report the density of
Arabic rhetoric in any Arabic text or speech.

### [12] [Curved Inference: Concern-Sensitive Geometry in Large Language Model Residual Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21107)
*Rob Manson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Curved Inference的几何可解释性框架，用于分析大型语言模型在语义关注变化下的残差流轨迹弯曲情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在语义关注变化下的内部激活轨迹变化，以揭示其语义抽象和模型对齐的动态。

Method: 使用Gemma3-1b和LLaMA3.2-3b模型，通过20个匹配提示，计算曲率和显着性等指标，基于解嵌入矩阵的语义度量进行分析。

Result: 发现语义关注变化会显著改变模型的激活轨迹，LLaMA在曲率和显着性上表现更强，Gemma则区分较弱。

Conclusion: 支持两层LLM几何结构观点，Curved Inference为诊断模型对齐和语义动态提供了新方法。

Abstract: We propose Curved Inference - a geometric Interpretability framework that
tracks how the residual stream trajectory of a large language model bends in
response to shifts in semantic concern. Across 20 matched prompts spanning
emotional, moral, perspective, logical, identity, environmental, and nonsense
domains, we analyse Gemma3-1b and LLaMA3.2-3b using five native-space metrics,
with a primary focus on curvature (\k{appa}_i) and salience (S(t)). These
metrics are computed under a pullback semantic metric derived from the
unembedding matrix, ensuring that all measurements reflect token-aligned
geometry rather than raw coordinate structure. We find that concern-shifted
prompts reliably alter internal activation trajectories in both models - with
LLaMA exhibiting consistent, statistically significant scaling in both
curvature and salience as concern intensity increases. Gemma also responds to
concern but shows weaker differentiation between moderate and strong variants.
Our results support a two-layer view of LLM geometry - a latent conceptual
structure encoded in the embedding space, and a contextual trajectory shaped by
prompt-specific inference. Curved Inference reveals how models navigate,
reorient, or reinforce semantic meaning over depth, offering a principled
method for diagnosing alignment, abstraction, and emergent inference dynamics.
These findings offer fresh insight into semantic abstraction and model
alignment through the lens of Curved Inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动审查法律合同效率低且易出错，需要自动化解决方案以提高速度、准确性和可访问性。

Method: 分类了七种LCC任务，审查了14个数据集，并提出了基于传统机器学习、深度学习和Transformer的方法论分类。

Result: 总结了现有方法的性能，并指出了其局限性。

Conclusion: 该综述为法律NLP研究者和从业者提供了全面指导，旨在推动法律信息更易获取和社会更公平。

Abstract: Given the large size and volumes of contracts and their underlying inherent
complexity, manual reviews become inefficient and prone to errors, creating a
clear need for automation. Automatic Legal Contract Classification (LCC)
revolutionizes the way legal contracts are analyzed, offering substantial
improvements in speed, accuracy, and accessibility. This survey delves into the
challenges of automatic LCC and a detailed examination of key tasks, datasets,
and methodologies. We identify seven classification tasks within LCC, and
review fourteen datasets related to English-language contracts, including
public, proprietary, and non-public sources. We also introduce a methodology
taxonomy for LCC, categorized into Traditional Machine Learning, Deep Learning,
and Transformer-based approaches. Additionally, the survey discusses evaluation
techniques and highlights the best-performing results from the reviewed
studies. By providing a thorough overview of current methods and their
limitations, this survey suggests future research directions to improve the
efficiency, accuracy, and scalability of LCC. As the first comprehensive survey
on LCC, it aims to support legal NLP researchers and practitioners in improving
legal processes, making legal information more accessible, and promoting a more
informed and equitable society.

### [14] [SemRAG: Semantic Knowledge-Augmented RAG for Improved Question-Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21110)
*Kezhen Zhong,Basem Suleiman,Abdelkarim Erradi,Shijing Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemRAG是一个改进的RAG框架，通过语义分块和知识图谱高效整合领域知识，无需大量微调，提升检索准确性和上下文理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法计算成本高、易过拟合且扩展性差，SemRAG旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 使用语义分块算法和知识图谱结构，优化检索性能。

Result: 实验显示SemRAG在检索相关性和正确性上显著优于传统RAG方法。

Conclusion: SemRAG提供了一种高效、可扩展的领域专用LLM解决方案，符合可持续发展目标。

Abstract: This paper introduces SemRAG, an enhanced Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG) framework that efficiently integrates domain-specific knowledge using
semantic chunking and knowledge graphs without extensive fine-tuning.
Integrating domain-specific knowledge into large language models (LLMs) is
crucial for improving their performance in specialized tasks. Yet, existing
adaptations are computationally expensive, prone to overfitting and limit
scalability. To address these challenges, SemRAG employs a semantic chunking
algorithm that segments documents based on the cosine similarity from sentence
embeddings, preserving semantic coherence while reducing computational
overhead. Additionally, by structuring retrieved information into knowledge
graphs, SemRAG captures relationships between entities, improving retrieval
accuracy and contextual understanding. Experimental results on MultiHop RAG and
Wikipedia datasets demonstrate SemRAG has significantly enhances the relevance
and correctness of retrieved information from the Knowledge Graph,
outperforming traditional RAG methods. Furthermore, we investigate the
optimization of buffer sizes for different data corpus, as optimizing buffer
sizes tailored to specific datasets can further improve retrieval performance,
as integration of knowledge graphs strengthens entity relationships for better
contextual comprehension. The primary advantage of SemRAG is its ability to
create an efficient, accurate domain-specific LLM pipeline while avoiding
resource-intensive fine-tuning. This makes it a practical and scalable approach
aligned with sustainability goals, offering a viable solution for AI
applications in domain-specific fields.

### [15] [InsurTech innovation using natural language processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21112)
*Panyi Dong,Zhiyu Quan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了自然语言处理（NLP）在保险业中的应用，展示了如何将非结构化文本转化为结构化数据以支持精算分析和决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着InsurTech的快速发展，传统保险公司需要利用替代数据源和先进技术保持竞争力。

Method: 结合InsurTech合作伙伴提供的真实替代数据，应用多种NLP技术，展示了商业保险中的实际用例。

Result: 通过NLP技术丰富了传统保险定价的评级因素，并引入了新的行业分类视角来评估风险。

Conclusion: NLP不仅是辅助工具，更是现代数据驱动保险分析的基础要素。

Abstract: With the rapid rise of InsurTech, traditional insurance companies are
increasingly exploring alternative data sources and advanced technologies to
sustain their competitive edge. This paper provides both a conceptual overview
and practical case studies of natural language processing (NLP) and its
emerging applications within insurance operations with a focus on transforming
raw, unstructured text into structured data suitable for actuarial analysis and
decision-making. Leveraging real-world alternative data provided by an
InsurTech industry partner that enriches traditional insurance data sources, we
apply various NLP techniques to demonstrate practical use cases in the
commercial insurance context. These enriched, text-derived insights not only

but also offer novel perspectives for assessing underlying risk by introducing
novel industry classifications. Through these demonstrations, we show that NLP
is not merely a supplementary tool but a foundational element for modern,
data-driven insurance analytics.

TL;DR: 论文提出Trident-Bench，一个针对法律、金融和医学领域的大语言模型（LLM）安全评估基准，填补了领域特定安全风险评估的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在高风险领域的广泛应用，评估其领域特定安全性变得至关重要，而现有研究多关注性能提升，忽视了安全风险。

Method: 基于专业伦理准则定义领域安全原则，并开发Trident-Bench基准，评估了19个通用和领域专用模型。

Result: 通用模型（如GPT、Gemini）满足基本安全要求，而领域专用模型在细微伦理问题上表现不佳，揭示安全改进需求。

Conclusion: Trident-Bench为LLM在专业领域的安全性研究提供了系统资源，为未来减少部署风险奠定基础。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-risk
domains such as law, finance, and medicine, systematically evaluating their
domain-specific safety and compliance becomes critical. While prior work has
largely focused on improving LLM performance in these domains, it has often
neglected the evaluation of domain-specific safety risks. To bridge this gap,
we first define domain-specific safety principles for LLMs based on the AMA
Principles of Medical Ethics, the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, and
the CFA Institute Code of Ethics. Building on this foundation, we introduce
Trident-Bench, a benchmark specifically targeting LLM safety in the legal,
financial, and medical domains. We evaluated 19 general-purpose and
domain-specialized models on Trident-Bench and show that it effectively reveals
key safety gaps -- strong generalist models (e.g., GPT, Gemini) can meet basic
expectations, whereas domain-specialized models often struggle with subtle
ethical nuances. This highlights an urgent need for finer-grained
domain-specific safety improvements. By introducing Trident-Bench, our work
provides one of the first systematic resources for studying LLM safety in law
and finance, and lays the groundwork for future research aimed at reducing the
safety risks of deploying LLMs in professionally regulated fields. Code and
benchmark will be released at: https://github.com/zackhuiiiii/TRIDENT

Motivation: 开发高质量、高效且支持多语言和情感控制的文本转语音模型，满足实时和复杂应用需求。

Method: 通过预训练、微调和RL对齐的SpeechLM组件，结合大规模计算资源，实现模型优化。

Result: 在多种基准测试中达到SOTA性能，支持48 kHz高分辨率语音和11种语言，具备低延迟和情感控制能力。

Conclusion: Inworld TTS-1系列模型在质量和效率上表现优异，适用于多种应用场景，并开源了代码。

Abstract: We introduce Inworld TTS-1, a set of two Transformer-based autoregressive
text-to-speech (TTS) models. Our largest model, TTS-1-Max, has 8.8B parameters
and is designed for utmost quality and expressiveness in demanding
applications. TTS-1 is our most efficient model, with 1.6B parameters, built
for real-time speech synthesis and on-device use cases. By scaling train-time
compute and applying a sequential process of pre-training, fine-tuning, and
RL-alignment of the speech-language model (SpeechLM) component, both models
achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of benchmarks, demonstrating
exceptional quality relying purely on in-context learning of the speaker's
voice. Inworld TTS-1 and TTS-1-Max can generate high-resolution 48 kHz speech
with low latency, and support 11 languages with fine-grained emotional control
and non-verbal vocalizations through audio markups. We additionally open-source
our training and modeling code under an MIT license.

TL;DR: 论文比较了两种利用多样性提升大语言模型（LLM）性能的方法：模型多样性和问题解释多样性。实验表明，问题解释多样性在多数投票集成中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何有效利用多样性提升LLM性能，解决现有方法效果不明确的问题。

Method: 比较模型多样性（多模型回答同一问题）和问题解释多样性（同一模型回答不同表述的问题），采用多数投票作为集成策略。

Result: 在boolq、strategyqa和pubmedqa数据集上，问题解释多样性显著优于模型多样性；GPT和LLaMa实验中，模型多样性表现介于最佳和最差集成成员之间。

Conclusion: 问题解释多样性是更有效的多样性利用方式，模型多样性效果有限。

Abstract: Effectively leveraging diversity has been shown to improve performance for
various machine learning models, including large language models (LLMs).
However, determining the most effective way of using diversity remains a
challenge. In this work, we compare two diversity approaches for answering
binary questions using LLMs: model diversity, which relies on multiple models
answering the same question, and question interpretation diversity, which
relies on using the same model to answer the same question framed in different
ways. For both cases, we apply majority voting as the ensemble consensus
heuristic to determine the final answer. Our experiments on boolq, strategyqa,
and pubmedqa show that question interpretation diversity consistently leads to
better ensemble accuracy compared to model diversity. Furthermore, our analysis
of GPT and LLaMa shows that model diversity typically produces results between
the best and the worst ensemble members without clear improvement.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的激活对比归因方法Contrast-CAT，通过过滤类别无关特征，提升Transformer文本分类模型的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型的决策解释性差，影响其在实际应用中的可信度和安全部署。现有激活归因方法易受类别无关特征干扰，导致解释不可靠。

Method: 提出Contrast-CAT方法，通过对比输入序列与参考激活，过滤类别无关特征，生成更清晰的归因图。

Result: 实验表明，Contrast-CAT在多个数据集和模型上表现优于现有方法，AOPC和LOdds指标显著提升。

Conclusion: Contrast-CAT有效提升了Transformer文本分类模型的解释性，为实际应用提供了更可靠的解释工具。

Abstract: Transformers have profoundly influenced AI research, but explaining their
decisions remains challenging -- even for relatively simpler tasks such as
classification -- which hinders trust and safe deployment in real-world
applications. Although activation-based attribution methods effectively explain
transformer-based text classification models, our findings reveal that these
methods can be undermined by class-irrelevant features within activations,
leading to less reliable interpretations. To address this limitation, we
propose Contrast-CAT, a novel activation contrast-based attribution method that
refines token-level attributions by filtering out class-irrelevant features. By
contrasting the activations of an input sequence with reference activations,
Contrast-CAT generates clearer and more faithful attribution maps. Experimental
results across various datasets and models confirm that Contrast-CAT
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Notably, under the MoRF
setting, it achieves average improvements of x1.30 in AOPC and x2.25 in LOdds
over the most competing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing
interpretability for transformer-based text classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体成为公众表达对犯罪事件意见的重要平台，动态变化的公众情感值得研究。

Method: 使用新构建的28,528条孟加拉语评论数据集，基于XLM-RoBERTa Base架构的Transformer模型进行分类。

Result: 模型分类准确率达97%，优于现有方法，并通过可解释AI技术识别关键特征。

Conclusion: Transformer模型在处理低资源语言（如孟加拉语）中表现优异，可为公共政策制定和犯罪预防提供支持。

Abstract: In recent years, social media platforms have become prominent spaces for
individuals to express their opinions on ongoing events, including criminal
incidents. As a result, public sentiment can shift dynamically over time. This
study investigates the evolving public perception of crime-related news by
classifying user-generated comments into three categories: positive, negative,
and neutral. A newly curated dataset comprising 28,528 Bangla-language social
media comments was developed for this purpose. We propose a transformer-based
model utilizing the XLM-RoBERTa Base architecture, which achieves a
classification accuracy of 97%, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods
in Bangla sentiment analysis. To enhance model interpretability, explainable AI
technique is employed to identify the most influential features driving
sentiment classification. The results underscore the effectiveness of
transformer-based models in processing low-resource languages such as Bengali
and demonstrate their potential to extract actionable insights that can support
public policy formulation and crime prevention strategies.

TL;DR: 研究通过微调Bangla BERT模型，成功提升了孟加拉语超党派新闻分类的准确性，准确率达95.65%，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉语作为低资源语言，缺乏先进的自然语言处理技术，导致超党派新闻难以检测，影响公共话语。

Method: 微调Bangla BERT模型，结合半监督学习和LIME解释工具，提升分类透明度和准确性。

Result: Bangla BERT在试验数据中表现优异，准确率达95.65%，显著优于传统机器学习模型。

Conclusion: 研究表明，即使在资源有限的环境中，Transformer模型也能有效提升分类性能，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: In the current digital landscape, misinformation circulates rapidly, shaping
public perception and causing societal divisions. It is difficult to identify
hyperpartisan news in Bangla since there aren't many sophisticated natural
language processing methods available for this low-resource language. Without
effective detection methods, biased content can spread unchecked, posing
serious risks to informed discourse. To address this gap, our research
fine-tunes Bangla BERT. This is a state-of-the-art transformer-based model,
designed to enhance classification accuracy for hyperpartisan news. We evaluate
its performance against traditional machine learning models and implement
semi-supervised learning to enhance predictions further. Not only that, we use
LIME to provide transparent explanations of the model's decision-making
process, which helps to build trust in its outcomes. With a remarkable accuracy
score of 95.65%, Bangla BERT outperforms conventional approaches, according to
our trial data. The findings of this study demonstrate the usefulness of
transformer models even in environments with limited resources, which opens the
door to further improvements in this area.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了基于人类临床解释的额外监督是否能提升基于Transformer的临床文本分类模型的性能和可解释性。结果显示，在高资源场景下临床解释能提升性能，但资源有限时效果不一致，且总体表现不如直接使用更多报告。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人类临床解释作为额外监督是否能提升模型性能和可解释性，尤其是在临床文本分类任务中。

Method: 分析了99,125条人类临床解释和128,649份电子病理报告，评估了基于Transformer的模型在提取原发癌症部位任务中的表现，并研究了使用充分性作为解释质量预选指标的效果。

Result: 临床解释作为额外训练数据在高资源场景下能提升性能，但资源有限时效果不稳定。使用充分性预选解释也效果不一致。模型在解释训练下的表现不如直接使用更多报告。

Conclusion: 如果目标是优化准确性，应优先标注更多报告而非生成解释；若注重可解释性，解释补充数据可能有助于模型识别解释类特征。临床解释带来的性能提升较小，可解释性改善有限。

Abstract: AI-driven clinical text classification is vital for explainable automated
retrieval of population-level health information. This work investigates
whether human-based clinical rationales can serve as additional supervision to
improve both performance and explainability of transformer-based models that
automatically encode clinical documents. We analyzed 99,125 human-based
clinical rationales that provide plausible explanations for primary cancer site
diagnoses, using them as additional training samples alongside 128,649
electronic pathology reports to evaluate transformer-based models for
extracting primary cancer sites. We also investigated sufficiency as a way to
measure rationale quality for pre-selecting rationales. Our results showed that
clinical rationales as additional training data can improve model performance
in high-resource scenarios but produce inconsistent behavior when resources are
limited. Using sufficiency as an automatic metric to preselect rationales also
leads to inconsistent results. Importantly, models trained on rationales were
consistently outperformed by models trained on additional reports instead. This
suggests that clinical rationales don't consistently improve model performance
and are outperformed by simply using more reports. Therefore, if the goal is
optimizing accuracy, annotation efforts should focus on labeling more reports
rather than creating rationales. However, if explainability is the priority,
training models on rationale-supplemented data may help them better identify
rationale-like features. We conclude that using clinical rationales as
additional training data results in smaller performance improvements and only
slightly better explainability (measured as average token-level rationale
coverage) compared to training on additional reports.

TL;DR: 研究发现当前大语言模型（LLMs）在捕捉跨文化道德差异方面表现不佳，倾向于压缩差异且与实证调查数据对齐度低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否能够反映跨文化道德视角的差异和相似性，以解决其训练数据中潜在的偏见问题。

Method: 采用三种方法：比较模型与调查数据的道德评分方差、进行聚类对齐分析、直接通过系统选择的词对提示模型。

Result: LLMs未能完全再现跨文化道德差异，表现出低对齐度和差异压缩。

Conclusion: 需改进LLMs以减少偏见并提升文化代表性，强调公平和伦理对齐的重要性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have established them as
powerful tools across numerous domains. However, persistent concerns about
embedded biases, such as gender, racial, and cultural biases arising from their
training data, raise significant questions about the ethical use and societal
consequences of these technologies. This study investigates the extent to which
LLMs capture cross-cultural differences and similarities in moral perspectives.
Specifically, we examine whether LLM outputs align with patterns observed in
international survey data on moral attitudes. To this end, we employ three
complementary methods: (1) comparing variances in moral scores produced by
models versus those reported in surveys, (2) conducting cluster alignment
analyses to assess correspondence between country groupings derived from LLM
outputs and survey data, and (3) directly probing models with comparative
prompts using systematically chosen token pairs. Our results reveal that
current LLMs often fail to reproduce the full spectrum of cross-cultural moral
variation, tending to compress differences and exhibit low alignment with
empirical survey patterns. These findings highlight a pressing need for more
robust approaches to mitigate biases and improve cultural representativeness in
LLMs. We conclude by discussing the implications for the responsible
development and global deployment of LLMs, emphasizing fairness and ethical
alignment.

Result: 系统表现优异，词错误率29%，音素错误率12%，整体准确率74%。

Conclusion: 深度学习可显著提升资源稀缺语言的ASR性能，促进Shona语的可及性和全球交流。

Abstract: This study presented the development of a deep learning-based Automatic
Speech Recognition system for Shona, a low-resource language characterized by
unique tonal and grammatical complexities. The research aimed to address the
challenges posed by limited training data, lack of labelled data, and the
intricate tonal nuances present in Shona speech, with the objective of
achieving significant improvements in recognition accuracy compared to
traditional statistical models. The research first explored the feasibility of
using deep learning to develop an accurate ASR system for Shona. Second, it
investigated the specific challenges involved in designing and implementing
deep learning architectures for Shona speech recognition and proposed
strategies to mitigate these challenges. Lastly, it compared the performance of
the deep learning-based model with existing statistical models in terms of
accuracy. The developed ASR system utilized a hybrid architecture consisting of
a Convolutional Neural Network for acoustic modelling and a Long Short-Term
Memory network for language modelling. To overcome the scarcity of data, data
augmentation techniques and transfer learning were employed. Attention
mechanisms were also incorporated to accommodate the tonal nature of Shona
speech. The resulting ASR system achieved impressive results, with a Word Error
Rate of 29%, Phoneme Error Rate of 12%, and an overall accuracy of 74%. These
metrics indicated the potential of deep learning to enhance ASR accuracy for
under-resourced languages like Shona. This study contributed to the advancement
of ASR technology for under-resourced languages like Shona, ultimately
fostering improved accessibility and communication for Shona speakers
worldwide.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在特定领域或组织文档中提取质量的基准，手动标注成本高且难以扩展。

Method: StructText采用两阶段“计划-执行”流程，利用表格数据作为结构化基准，生成自然语言文本，并通过LLM判断和客观提取指标进行多维评估。

Result: 在71,539个示例和49个数据集上的评估显示，LLMs在事实准确性和避免幻觉方面表现良好，但在生成可提取的连贯叙述方面存在困难。

Conclusion: StructText提供了一个包含数据集、评估工具和基线系统的框架，支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Extracting structured information from text, such as key-value pairs that
could augment tabular data, is quite useful in many enterprise use cases.
Although large language models (LLMs) have enabled numerous automated pipelines
for converting natural language into structured formats, there is still a lack
of benchmarks for evaluating their extraction quality, especially in specific
domains or focused documents specific to a given organization. Building such
benchmarks by manual annotations is labour-intensive and limits the size and
scalability of the benchmarks. In this work, we present StructText, an
end-to-end framework for automatically generating high-fidelity benchmarks for
key-value extraction from text using existing tabular data. It uses available
tabular data as structured ground truth, and follows a two-stage
``plan-then-execute'' pipeline to synthetically generate corresponding
natural-language text. To ensure alignment between text and structured source,
we introduce a multi-dimensional evaluation strategy that combines (a)
LLM-based judgments on factuality, hallucination, and coherence and (b)
objective extraction metrics measuring numeric and temporal accuracy. We
evaluated the proposed method on 71,539 examples across 49 datasets. Results
reveal that while LLMs achieve strong factual accuracy and avoid hallucination,
they struggle with narrative coherence in producing extractable text. Notably,
models presume numerical and temporal information with high fidelity yet this
information becomes embedded in narratives that resist automated extraction. We
release a framework, including datasets, evaluation tools, and baseline
extraction systems, to support continued research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的网页历史压缩方法，通过压缩历史状态提升网页自动化效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网页自动化方法忽略了历史状态的重要性，且冗长的网页状态导致输入序列过长和信息稀疏，影响历史状态的有效利用。

Method: 采用历史压缩模块，将每个历史状态中最相关的任务信息提取为固定长度的短表示。

Result: 在Mind2Web和WebLINX数据集上的实验表明，该方法比基线方法（无历史输入）的绝对准确率提高了1.2-5.4%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过压缩历史状态，显著提升了网页自动化的性能。

Abstract: Language models have led to a leap forward in web automation. The current web
automation approaches take the current web state, history actions, and language
instruction as inputs to predict the next action, overlooking the importance of
history states. However, the highly verbose nature of web page states can
result in long input sequences and sparse information, hampering the effective
utilization of history states. In this paper, we propose a novel web history
compressor approach to turbocharge web automation using history states. Our
approach employs a history compressor module that distills the most
task-relevant information from each history state into a fixed-length short
representation, mitigating the challenges posed by the highly verbose history
states. Experiments are conducted on the Mind2Web and WebLINX datasets to
evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Results show that our approach
obtains 1.2-5.4% absolute accuracy improvements compared to the baseline
approach without history inputs.

TL;DR: MemTool是一个短期记忆框架，帮助LLM代理在多轮对话中动态管理工具或MCP服务器上下文，提供三种模式（自主代理、工作流和混合模式），并在实验中展示了不同模式在工具移除效率和任务完成准确性上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定上下文窗口限制了LLM代理在多轮交互中的效果，尤其是在需要重复独立使用工具的场景中。

Method: 引入MemTool框架，提供三种代理架构：自主代理模式、工作流模式和混合模式，并通过实验评估其性能。

Result: 自主代理模式在大型模型上工具移除效率高（90-94%），而中型模型效率低（0-60%）；工作流和混合模式在工具移除上表现稳定，自主和混合模式在任务完成上更优。

Conclusion: MemTool为不同任务需求提供了灵活的模式选择，需根据任务准确性、代理能力和模型性能权衡使用。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown significant autonomous
capabilities in dynamically searching and incorporating relevant tools or Model
Context Protocol (MCP) servers for individual queries. However, fixed context
windows limit effectiveness in multi-turn interactions requiring repeated,
independent tool usage. We introduce MemTool, a short-term memory framework
enabling LLM agents to dynamically manage tools or MCP server contexts across
multi-turn conversations. MemTool offers three agentic architectures: 1)
Autonomous Agent Mode, granting full tool management autonomy, 2) Workflow
Mode, providing deterministic control without autonomy, and 3) Hybrid Mode,
combining autonomous and deterministic control. Evaluating each MemTool mode
across 13+ LLMs on the ScaleMCP benchmark, we conducted experiments over 100
consecutive user interactions, measuring tool removal ratios (short-term memory
efficiency) and task completion accuracy. In Autonomous Agent Mode, reasoning
LLMs achieve high tool-removal efficiency (90-94% over a 3-window average),
while medium-sized models exhibit significantly lower efficiency (0-60%).
Workflow and Hybrid modes consistently manage tool removal effectively, whereas
Autonomous and Hybrid modes excel at task completion. We present trade-offs and
recommendations for each MemTool mode based on task accuracy, agency, and model
capabilities.

Motivation: 探索如何利用本地可部署的因果大语言模型（LLMs）改进旅行方式选择预测，并提升模型的解释性，以支持交通研究和政策制定。

Method: 通过微调因果LLMs（LiTransMC），在三个数据集上测试了11种LLMs的396种配置，并引入BERTopic和新的解释强度指数评估模型生成的推理。

Result: LiTransMC在加权F1得分和Jensen-Shannon散度上表现优异，超越了未调优模型、GPT-4o及经典方法，同时具备高解释性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，本地可部署的专用LLMs能够整合预测与解释性，为交通研究和政策制定提供高效、隐私保护的解决方案。

Abstract: This study investigates the adoption of open-access, locally deployable
causal large language models (LLMs) for travel mode choice prediction and
introduces LiTransMC, the first fine-tuned causal LLM developed for this task.
We systematically benchmark eleven LLMs (1-12B parameters) across three stated
and revealed preference datasets, testing 396 configurations and generating
over 79,000 synthetic commuter predictions. Beyond predictive accuracy, we
evaluate models generated reasoning using BERTopic for topic modelling and a
novel Explanation Strength Index, providing the first structured analysis of
how LLMs articulate decision factors in alignment with behavioural theory.
LiTransMC, fine-tuned using parameter efficient and loss masking strategy,
achieved a weighted F1 score of 0.6845 and a Jensen-Shannon Divergence of
0.000245, surpassing both untuned local models and larger proprietary systems,
including GPT-4o with advanced persona inference and embedding-based loading,
while also outperforming classical mode choice methods such as discrete choice
models and machine learning classifiers for the same dataset. This dual
improvement, i.e., high instant-level accuracy and near-perfect distributional
calibration, demonstrates the feasibility of creating specialist, locally
deployable LLMs that integrate prediction and interpretability. Through
combining structured behavioural prediction with natural language reasoning,
this work unlocks the potential for conversational, multi-task transport models
capable of supporting agent-based simulations, policy testing, and behavioural
insight generation. These findings establish a pathway for transforming general
purpose LLMs into specialized, explainable tools for transportation research
and policy formulation, while maintaining privacy, reducing cost, and
broadening access through local deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着推理模型在数学和科学领域的基准测试中趋于饱和，需要在非STEM领域（如幽默理解）进行新颖且具有挑战性的评估。

Method: HumorBench包含约300个独特的漫画-标题对，来自《纽约客》标题竞赛和Cartoonstock.com，并配有专家标注的评估标准。LLM通过解释幽默和识别笑话元素的能力进行评估。

Result: 当前SOTA模型的测试显示：（1）LLM在STEM推理上的进步能有效转移到幽默理解；（2）仅基于STEM数据训练的模型在HumorBench上表现良好；（3）增加推理时间对不同模型的效果不一。

Conclusion: HumorBench为评估LLM在复杂幽默理解中的推理能力提供了新视角，并展示了推理能力的可迁移性。

Abstract: We present HumorBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate large language
models' (LLMs) ability to reason about and explain sophisticated humor in
cartoon captions. As reasoning models increasingly saturate existing benchmarks
in mathematics and science, novel and challenging evaluations of model
intelligence beyond STEM domains are essential. Reasoning is fundamentally
involved in text-based humor comprehension, requiring the identification of
connections between concepts in cartoons/captions and external cultural
references, wordplays, and other mechanisms. HumorBench includes approximately
300 unique cartoon-caption pairs from the New Yorker Caption Contest and
Cartoonstock.com, with expert-annotated evaluation rubrics identifying
essential joke elements. LLMs are evaluated based on their explanations towards
the humor and abilities in identifying the joke elements. To perform well on
this task, models must form and test hypotheses about associations between
concepts, potentially backtracking from initial interpretations to arrive at
the most plausible explanation. Our extensive benchmarking of current SOTA
models reveals three key insights: (1) LLM progress on STEM reasoning transfers
effectively to humor comprehension; (2) models trained exclusively on STEM
reasoning data still perform well on HumorBench, demonstrating strong

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 基于任务标签易获取和预训练模型在不同任务上置信度差异的观察，采用逆置信度加权策略选择样本。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在MMLU分数上提升4%，标注成本降低80%，性能优于或持平现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: 该方法简单高效，显著降低标注成本，同时提升模型性能，适用于多种标注预算和数据集。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse domains, but developing high-performing models for specialized
applications often requires substantial human annotation -- a process that is
time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive. In this paper, we address the
label-efficient learning problem for supervised finetuning (SFT) by leveraging
task-diversity as a fundamental principle for effective data selection. This is
markedly different from existing methods based on the prompt-diversity. Our
approach is based on two key observations: 1) task labels for different prompts
are often readily available; 2) pre-trained models have significantly varying
levels of confidence across tasks. We combine these facts to devise a simple
yet effective sampling strategy: we select examples across tasks using an
inverse confidence weighting strategy. This produces models comparable to or
better than those trained with more complex sampling procedures, while being
significantly easier to implement and less computationally intensive. Notably,
our experimental results demonstrate that this method can achieve better
accuracy than training on the complete dataset (a 4\% increase in MMLU score).
Across various annotation budgets and two instruction finetuning datasets, our
algorithm consistently performs at or above the level of the best existing
methods, while reducing annotation costs by up to 80\%.

TL;DR: 越南因互联网流量和在线毒性问题突出，急需嵌入模型用于推荐和内容控制。为解决缺乏大规模测试数据集的问题，研究者开发了越南基准VN-MTEB，通过翻译和过滤英语样本构建，涵盖41个数据集和6项任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 越南互联网环境复杂，缺乏适合的大规模测试数据集，阻碍了AI模型的有效评估和实际应用。

Method: 利用大型语言模型（LLMs）和先进嵌入模型翻译并过滤英语样本，确保语言流畅性和语义保真度，同时保留命名实体识别（NER）和代码片段。

Result: 构建了包含41个数据集和6项任务的越南基准VN-MTEB，发现使用Rotary Positional Embedding的更大、更复杂模型表现更优。

Conclusion: VN-MTEB为越南文本嵌入任务提供了高质量基准，有助于推动相关AI模型的研究和应用。

Abstract: Vietnam ranks among the top countries in terms of both internet traffic and
online toxicity. As a result, implementing embedding models for recommendation
and content control duties in applications is crucial. However, a lack of
large-scale test datasets, both in volume and task diversity, makes it tricky
for scientists to effectively evaluate AI models before deploying them in
real-world, large-scale projects. To solve this important problem, we introduce
a Vietnamese benchmark, VN-MTEB for embedding models, which we created by
translating a large number of English samples from the Massive Text Embedding
Benchmark using our new automated framework. We leverage the strengths of large
language models (LLMs) and cutting-edge embedding models to conduct translation
and filtering processes to retain high-quality samples, guaranteeing a natural
flow of language and semantic fidelity while preserving named entity
recognition (NER) and code snippets. Our comprehensive benchmark consists of 41
datasets from six tasks specifically designed for Vietnamese text embeddings.
In our analysis, we find that bigger and more complex models using Rotary
Positional Embedding outperform those using Absolute Positional Embedding in
embedding tasks. Datasets are available at HuggingFace:

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型中“助手”角色的激活空间方向（人格向量），用于监控和预测训练中的人格变化，并提出干预方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 助手角色通常被训练为有帮助、无害和诚实，但有时会偏离这些目标。研究旨在识别和控制这些偏离。

Method: 通过识别激活空间中的人格向量，监控和预测训练中的人格变化，并提出干预和预防方法。

Result: 人格向量能有效预测和控制训练中的人格变化，干预方法可减少不良变化。

Conclusion: 人格向量提供了一种自动化方法，可用于监控和优化语言模型的行为。

Abstract: Large language models interact with users through a simulated 'Assistant'
persona. While the Assistant is typically trained to be helpful, harmless, and
honest, it sometimes deviates from these ideals. In this paper, we identify
directions in the model's activation space-persona vectors-underlying several
traits, such as evil, sycophancy, and propensity to hallucinate. We confirm
that these vectors can be used to monitor fluctuations in the Assistant's
personality at deployment time. We then apply persona vectors to predict and
control personality shifts that occur during training. We find that both
intended and unintended personality changes after finetuning are strongly
correlated with shifts along the relevant persona vectors. These shifts can be
mitigated through post-hoc intervention, or avoided in the first place with a
new preventative steering method. Moreover, persona vectors can be used to flag
training data that will produce undesirable personality changes, both at the
dataset level and the individual sample level. Our method for extracting
persona vectors is automated and can be applied to any personality trait of
interest, given only a natural-language description.

*Tuan Vu Ho,Hiroaki Kokubo,Masaaki Yamamoto,Yohei Kawaguchi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Token Map Drafting的无模型推测解码技术，用于加速基于Transformer的端到端自动语音识别（ASR）系统在CPU设备上的推理速度，同时保持转录准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推测解码（SD）技术需要额外的草稿模型，这在缺乏硬件加速器（如GPU）的设备上不实用。因此，作者提出了一种无需草稿模型的方法，以解决资源受限设备的部署问题。

Method: 作者提出Token Map Drafting技术，利用预计算的n-gram token映射（基于领域特定训练数据）替代草稿模型，实现高效的推测解码。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在CI-AVSR数据集和内部数据集上分别实现了1.27倍和1.37倍的解码加速，且未降低识别准确性。此外，该方法在CPU上的解码速度比Distill-spec基线提高了10%。

Conclusion: Token Map Drafting是一种高效且实用的方法，特别适用于资源受限设备上的ASR应用，能够在保持准确性的同时显著提升推理速度。

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems based on transformer
architectures, such as Whisper, offer high transcription accuracy and
robustness. However, their autoregressive decoding is computationally
expensive, hence limiting deployment on CPU-based and resource-constrained
devices. Speculative decoding (SD) mitigates this issue by using a smaller
draft model to propose candidate tokens, which are then verified by the main
model. However, this approach is impractical for devices lacking hardware
accelerators like GPUs. To address this, we propose \emph{Token Map Drafting},
a model-free SD technique that eliminates the need for a separate draft model.
Instead, we leverage a precomputed n-gram token map derived from
domain-specific training data, enabling efficient speculative decoding with
minimal overhead. Our method significantly accelerates ASR inference in
structured, low-perplexity domains without sacrificing transcription accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate decoding speed-ups of $1.27\times$ on the
CI-AVSR dataset and $1.37\times$ on our internal dataset without degrading
recognition accuracy. Additionally, our approach achieves a $10\%$ absolute
improvement in decoding speed over the Distill-spec baseline running on CPU,
highlighting its effectiveness for on-device ASR applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TriangleMix是一种新型的静态注意力模式，通过在浅层使用密集注意力，深层切换为三角形稀疏模式，显著减少计算开销，同时保持模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型中注意力机制因输入序列长度增加而导致的二次时间复杂度和计算瓶颈问题。

Method: 提出TriangleMix，浅层使用密集注意力，深层采用三角形稀疏模式，无需训练即可实现。

Result: 在深层减少注意力开销3.7x至15.3x，整体TTFT降低12%至32%，且不损失精度。

Conclusion: TriangleMix能有效提升LLM推理效率，并可与其他动态稀疏方法结合进一步加速。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on attention mechanisms whose time
complexity grows quadratically with input sequence length, creating significant
computational bottlenecks during the prefilling stage. Existing static sparse
attention methods typically degrade accuracy, while dynamic sparsity methods
introduce additional computational overhead due to runtime sparse index
estimation. To address these limitations, we propose TriangleMix, a novel
training-free static attention pattern. TriangleMix employs dense attention in
shallow layers and switches to a triangle-shaped sparse pattern in deeper
layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TriangleMix reduces attention
overhead by 3.7x to 15.3x in deep layers, and decreases overall
Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) by 12% to 32% for sequence lengths ranging from 32K
to 128K, without sacrificing model accuracy. Moreover, TriangleMix can be
seamlessly integrated with dynamic sparsity methods to achieve further speedup,
e.g. accelerating MInference by 19% at 128K, highlighting its potential to
enhance LLM inference efficiency.

TL;DR: 该论文复现并扩展了一项NLP4RE研究，评估了深度学习模型在需求分类中的表现，并比较了GPT-4零样本分类器的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP技术在需求工程中的应用日益广泛，但相关研究的可复现性不足，因此通过复现和扩展研究来验证和增强其外部有效性。

Method: 复现了基线研究的深度学习模型，并扩展了实验，包括在外部数据集上评估模型性能，并与GPT-4零样本分类器进行比较。

Result: 不同模型的可复现性水平各异，BERT和ELMo在外部数据集上表现良好，GPT-4性能与传统基线模型相当。

Conclusion: 研究证实了基线研究的可复现性，并提供了缺失的环境设置文件以支持未来复现。

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) techniques have been widely applied in the
requirements engineering (RE) field to support tasks such as classification and
ambiguity detection. Although RE research is rooted in empirical investigation,
it has paid limited attention to replicating NLP for RE (NLP4RE) studies. The
rapidly advancing realm of NLP is creating new opportunities for efficient,
machine-assisted workflows, which can bring new perspectives and results to the
forefront. Thus, we replicate and extend a previous NLP4RE study (baseline),
"Classifying User Requirements from Online Feedback in Small Dataset
Environments using Deep Learning", which evaluated different deep learning
models for requirement classification from user reviews. We reproduced the
original results using publicly released source code, thereby helping to
strengthen the external validity of the baseline study. We then extended the
setup by evaluating model performance on an external dataset and comparing
results to a GPT-4o zero-shot classifier. Furthermore, we prepared the
replication study ID-card for the baseline study, important for evaluating
replication readiness. Results showed diverse reproducibility levels across
different models, with Naive Bayes demonstrating perfect reproducibility. In
contrast, BERT and other models showed mixed results. Our findings revealed
that baseline deep learning models, BERT and ELMo, exhibited good
generalization capabilities on an external dataset, and GPT-4o showed
performance comparable to traditional baseline machine learning models.
Additionally, our assessment confirmed the baseline study's replication
readiness; however missing environment setup files would have further enhanced
readiness. We include this missing information in our replication package and
provide the replication study ID-card for our study to further encourage and
support the replication of our study.

Motivation: 解决维吾尔语NLP中资源不足的问题，特别是针对其黏着语特性，现有树库无法满足需求。

Method: 提出了包含18种主要关系和26种子类型的标注框架，并通过预训练的通用依赖解析器进行跨标准评估。

Result: 实验显示标注差异达47.9%，表明通用方案不适用于维吾尔语特有结构。

Conclusion: 现代维吾尔语依赖树库（MUDT）提供了更准确、语义透明的表示，为其他形态复杂语言提供了可复制的模型。

Abstract: To address a critical resource gap in Uyghur Natural Language Processing
(NLP), this study introduces a dependency annotation framework designed to
overcome the limitations of existing treebanks for the low-resource,
agglutinative language. This inventory includes 18 main relations and 26
subtypes, with specific labels such as cop:zero for verbless clauses and
instr:case=loc/dat for nuanced instrumental functions. To empirically validate
the necessity of this tailored approach, we conducted a cross-standard
evaluation using a pre-trained Universal Dependencies parser. The analysis
revealed a systematic 47.9% divergence in annotations, pinpointing the
inadequacy of universal schemes for handling Uyghur-specific structures.
Grounded in nine annotation principles that ensure typological accuracy and
semantic transparency, the Modern Uyghur Dependency Treebank (MUDT) provides a
more accurate and semantically transparent representation, designed to enable
significant improvements in parsing and downstream NLP tasks, and offers a
replicable model for other morphologically complex languages.

Motivation: 现有基准在知识冲突研究中的局限性，如问题回答设置单一、依赖实体替换技术、冲突类型有限。

Method: 提出基于知识图谱（KG）的框架，生成多样且微妙的冲突，确保可解释性。

Result: 实验表明开源和专有LLMs在冲突检测和多跳推理中表现不佳，难以准确定位矛盾源。

Conclusion: 研究为改进LLMs在整合多样甚至冲突信息方面提供了基础。

Abstract: Knowledge conflict often arises in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
systems, where retrieved documents may be inconsistent with one another or
contradict the model's parametric knowledge. Existing benchmarks for
investigating the phenomenon have notable limitations, including a narrow focus
on the question answering setup, heavy reliance on entity substitution
techniques, and a restricted range of conflict types. To address these issues,
we propose a knowledge graph (KG)-based framework that generates varied and
subtle conflicts between two similar yet distinct contexts, while ensuring
interpretability through the explicit relational structure of KGs. Experimental
results on our benchmark, MAGIC, provide intriguing insights into the inner
workings of LLMs regarding knowledge conflict: both open-source and proprietary
models struggle with conflict detection -- especially when multi-hop reasoning
is required -- and often fail to pinpoint the exact source of contradictions.
Finally, we present in-depth analyses that serve as a foundation for improving
LLMs in integrating diverse, sometimes even conflicting, information.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究比较了基于Transformer的神经网络与人类行为数据，探讨西班牙语不规则形态模式的认知合理性。模型在词干和后缀准确性上优于人类，但在响应偏好上存在差异。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨神经网络是否能复制人类对复杂语言现象（如形态模式）的敏感性，并与人类行为数据直接对比。

Method: 使用与人类研究相同的分析框架，评估模型在三种频率条件下（自然、低频、高频）的表现。

Result: 模型在准确性上优于人类，但响应偏好不同；模型受训练数据中不规则动词比例影响，且对音系相似性敏感。

Conclusion: 模型与人类在语言处理上存在差异，提示需要进一步研究神经网络的认知合理性。

Abstract: This study investigates the cognitive plausibility of the Spanish irregular
morphomic pattern by directly comparing transformer-based neural networks to
human behavioral data from \citet{Nevins2015TheRA}. Using the same analytical
framework as the original human study, we evaluate whether transformer models
can replicate human-like sensitivity to a complex linguistic phenomena, the
morphome, under controlled input conditions. Our experiments focus on three
frequency conditions: natural, low-frequency, and high-frequency distributions
of verbs exhibiting irregular morphomic patterns. While the models outperformed
humans in stem and suffix accuracy, a clear divergence emerged in response
preferences. Unlike humans, who consistently favored natural responses across
all test items, models' preferred irregular responses and were influenced by
the proportion of irregular verbs in their training data. Additionally, models
trained on the natural and low-frequency distributions, but not the
high-frequency distribution, were sensitive to the phonological similarity
between test items and real Spanish L-shaped verbs.

Motivation: 教师模型的输出分布包含丰富信息，而传统束搜索方法仅提供近似模式，限制了学生模型的学习潜力。

Method: 利用束搜索的n-best列表生成多个翻译，采用替代解码方法解决低变异性和低频词不足的问题。

Result: 低资源语言中，采样方法虽略微降低翻译质量，但增加了变异性和词汇丰富性，提升了学生模型性能并减少性别偏见。

Conclusion: MHD方法通过多假设蒸馏显著改善了学生模型的学习效果，尤其在低资源语言中表现突出。

Abstract: This paper explores sequence-level knowledge distillation (KD) of
multilingual pre-trained encoder-decoder translation models. We argue that the
teacher model's output distribution holds valuable insights for the student,
beyond the approximated mode obtained through beam search (the standard
decoding method), and present Multi-Hypothesis Distillation (MHD), a
sequence-level KD method that generates multiple translations for each source
sentence. This provides a larger representation of the teacher model
distribution and exposes the student model to a wider range of target-side
prefixes. We leverage $n$-best lists from beam search to guide the student's
learning and examine alternative decoding methods to address issues like low
variability and the under-representation of infrequent tokens. For low-resource
languages, our research shows that while sampling methods may slightly
compromise translation quality compared to beam search based approaches, they
enhance the generated corpora with greater variability and lexical richness.
This ultimately improves student model performance and mitigates the gender
bias amplification often associated with KD.

Conclusion: 提出的框架和方法有效解决了奖励模型在复杂推理中的局限性，为推理能力的持续提升提供了新途径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly improved the reasoning ability
of large language models. However, current reward models underperform in
challenging reasoning scenarios and predominant RL training paradigms rely on
rule-based or reference-based rewards, which impose two critical limitations:
1) the dependence on finely annotated reference answer to attain rewards; and
2) the requirement for constrained output format. These limitations
fundamentally hinder further RL data scaling and sustained enhancement of model
reasoning performance. To address these limitations, we propose a comprehensive
framework for evaluating and improving the performance of reward models in
complex reasoning scenarios. We first present a reasoning-oriented benchmark
(Libra Bench), systematically constructed from a diverse collection of
challenging mathematical problems and advanced reasoning models, to address the
limitations of existing reward model benchmarks in reasoning scenarios. We
further introduce a novel approach for improving the generative reward model
via learning-to-think methodologies. Based on the proposed approach, we develop
Libra-RM series, a collection of generative reward models with reasoning
capabilities that achieve state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks.
Comprehensive downstream experiments are conducted and the experimental results
demonstrate the correlation between our Libra Bench and downstream application,
and the potential of Libra-RM to further improve reasoning models with
unlabeled data.

Motivation: 现有安全对齐研究主要关注过滤安全提示，而忽略了总是引发有害输出的硬提示。UnsafeChain旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 构建UnsafeChain数据集，包含多样化的硬提示，并明确纠正有害输出为安全响应。对三个大型推理模型进行微调。

Result: UnsafeChain在多个基准测试中优于现有数据集，甚至1K子集也能匹配或超越基线性能。

Conclusion: 基于纠正的监督方法在提升模型安全性和泛化能力方面有效。

Abstract: As large reasoning models (LRMs) grow more capable, chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning introduces new safety challenges. Existing SFT-based safety alignment
studies dominantly focused on filtering prompts with safe, high-quality
responses, while overlooking hard prompts that always elicit harmful outputs.
To fill this gap, we introduce UnsafeChain, a safety alignment dataset
constructed from hard prompts with diverse sources, where unsafe completions
are identified and explicitly corrected into safe responses. By exposing models
to unsafe behaviors and guiding their correction, UnsafeChain enhances safety
while preserving general reasoning ability. We fine-tune three LRMs on
UnsafeChain and compare them against recent SafeChain and STAR-1 across six
out-of-distribution and five in-distribution benchmarks. UnsafeChain
consistently outperforms prior datasets, with even a 1K subset matching or
surpassing baseline performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and
generalizability of correction-based supervision. We release our dataset and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练语言模型（PLMs）在自然语言处理中表现优异，但对对抗攻击脆弱，影响其实际应用。现有方法虽能提升鲁棒性，但计算成本高。

Method: 提出一种附加模块，通过移除实例级主成分，将嵌入空间转换为近似高斯分布，减少对抗扰动的影响，同时保留语义关系。

Result: 在八个基准数据集上的评估表明，该方法显著提升了对抗鲁棒性，同时保持了与基线相当的原始准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法在鲁棒性和泛化性之间取得了平衡，为增强PLMs的对抗鲁棒性提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have driven substantial progress in
natural language processing but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
raising concerns about their robustness in real-world applications. Previous
studies have sought to mitigate the impact of adversarial attacks by
introducing adversarial perturbations into the training process, either
implicitly or explicitly. While both strategies enhance robustness, they often
incur high computational costs. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
add-on module that enhances the adversarial robustness of PLMs by removing
instance-level principal components, without relying on conventional
adversarial defences or perturbing the original training data. Our approach
transforms the embedding space to approximate Gaussian properties, thereby
reducing its susceptibility to adversarial perturbations while preserving
semantic relationships. This transformation aligns embedding distributions in a
way that minimises the impact of adversarial noise on decision boundaries,
enhancing robustness without requiring adversarial examples or costly
training-time augmentation. Evaluations on eight benchmark datasets show that
our approach improves adversarial robustness while maintaining comparable
before-attack accuracy to baselines, achieving a balanced trade-off between
robustness and generalisation.

Motivation: 解决农业领域缺乏LLMs训练数据和评估基准的问题。

Method: 提出AgriEval基准，涵盖多类别和认知场景，使用高质量数据（大学考试和作业），并测试51个开源和商业LLMs。

Result: 大多数LLMs准确率低于60%，表明农业领域LLMs有待提升。

Conclusion: AgriEval填补了农业领域基准测试的空白，为LLMs在农业中的应用提供了评估和改进方向。

Abstract: In the agricultural domain, the deployment of large language models (LLMs) is
hindered by the lack of training data and evaluation benchmarks. To mitigate
this issue, we propose AgriEval, the first comprehensive Chinese agricultural
benchmark with three main characteristics: (1) Comprehensive Capability
Evaluation. AgriEval covers six major agriculture categories and 29
subcategories within agriculture, addressing four core cognitive scenarios:
memorization, understanding, inference, and generation. (2) High-Quality Data.
The dataset is curated from university-level examinations and assignments,
providing a natural and robust benchmark for assessing the capacity of LLMs to
apply knowledge and make expert-like decisions. (3) Diverse Formats and
Extensive Scale. AgriEval comprises 14,697 multiple-choice questions and 2,167
open-ended question-and-answer questions, establishing it as the most extensive
agricultural benchmark available to date. We also present comprehensive
experimental results over 51 open-source and commercial LLMs. The experimental
results reveal that most existing LLMs struggle to achieve 60% accuracy,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs安全分类器的有效性及评估数据集的问题，填补多语言场景下相关研究的空白。

Method: 通过分析覆盖18种语言的数据集，评估5个安全分类模型的多语言差异。

Result: 发现多语言差异及评估数据集的潜在问题，指出分类器的不足不仅源于模型本身。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于开发更好的多语言有害内容识别方法。

Abstract: Studying the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) to unsafe behaviors
is an important topic of research today. Building safety classification models
or guard models, which are fine-tuned models for input/output safety
classification for LLMs, is seen as one of the solutions to address the issue.
Although there is a lot of research on the safety testing of LLMs themselves,
there is little research on evaluating the effectiveness of such safety
classifiers or the evaluation datasets used for testing them, especially in
multilingual scenarios. In this position paper, we demonstrate how multilingual
disparities exist in 5 safety classification models by considering datasets
covering 18 languages. At the same time, we identify potential issues with the
evaluation datasets, arguing that the shortcomings of current safety
classifiers are not only because of the models themselves. We expect that these
findings will contribute to the discussion on developing better methods to
identify harmful content in LLM inputs across languages.

Motivation: 研究大语言模型在减少药物使用危害信息提供中的表现，填补相关任务性能的空白。

Method: 构建HRIPBench基准数据集（HRIP-Basic），包含2,160个问答对，涵盖安全边界检查、定量值提供和多物质使用风险推断任务，采用Instruction和RAG方案评估模型行为。

Result: 现有最先进的大语言模型在提供准确的减少危害信息方面表现不佳，且可能对药物使用者造成严重安全风险。

Conclusion: 在减少危害场景中使用大语言模型需谨慎，以避免负面健康后果。

Abstract: Millions of individuals' well-being are challenged by the harms of substance
use. Harm reduction as a public health strategy is designed to improve their
health outcomes and reduce safety risks. Some large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated a decent level of medical knowledge, promising to address the
information needs of people who use drugs (PWUD). However, their performance in
relevant tasks remains largely unexplored. We introduce HRIPBench, a benchmark
designed to evaluate LLM's accuracy and safety risks in harm reduction
information provision. The benchmark dataset HRIP-Basic has 2,160
question-answer-evidence pairs. The scope covers three tasks: checking safety
boundaries, providing quantitative values, and inferring polysubstance use
risks. We build the Instruction and RAG schemes to evaluate model behaviours
based on their inherent knowledge and the integration of domain knowledge. Our
results indicate that state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle to provide accurate
harm reduction information, and sometimes, carry out severe safety risks to
PWUD. The use of LLMs in harm reduction contexts should be cautiously
constrained to avoid inducing negative health outcomes. WARNING: This paper
contains illicit content that potentially induces harms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解事件合理性变化对对话生成、常识推理等任务至关重要，但现有研究较少关注。

Method: 使用句子转换器（sentence transformers）对ADEPT挑战基准中的16K英语句子对进行建模。

Result: 句子转换器和基于转换器的模型在此任务中表现不佳，且句子转换器甚至不如RoBERTa。

Conclusion: 研究强调了更现实、平衡的评估方法的重要性，以避免数据不平衡对模型性能和结果可信度的影响。

Abstract: While the task of assessing the plausibility of events such as ''news is
relevant'' has been addressed by a growing body of work, less attention has
been paid to capturing changes in plausibility as triggered by event
modification. Understanding changes in plausibility is relevant for tasks such
as dialogue generation, commonsense reasoning, and hallucination detection as
it allows to correctly model, for example, ''gentle sarcasm'' as a sign of
closeness rather than unkindness among friends [9]. In this work, we tackle the
ADEPT challenge benchmark [6] consisting of 16K English sentence pairs
differing by exactly one adjectival modifier. Our modeling experiments provide
a conceptually novel method by using sentence transformers, and reveal that
both they and transformer-based models struggle with the task at hand, and
sentence transformers - despite their conceptual alignment with the task - even
under-perform in comparison to models like RoBERTa. Furthermore, an in-depth
comparison with prior work highlights the importance of a more realistic,
balanced evaluation method: imbalances distort model performance and evaluation
metrics, and weaken result trustworthiness.

TL;DR: HALC是一种通用流程，用于系统构建最优提示策略，适用于不同LLM和任务。通过实验验证，HALC能生成可靠提示，提升编码任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有多种提示策略，但其效果因LLM和任务而异，缺乏系统性方法。HALC旨在解决这一问题，提供可靠提示构建流程。

Method: 提出HALC流程，通过实验（1512个提示，200万次请求）测试不同提示策略，基于专家编码（ground truth）评估性能。

Result: HALC生成的提示在单变量（αclimate = .76; αmovement = .78）和双变量（αclimate = .71; αmovement = .74）任务中表现可靠。

Conclusion: HALC为不同任务和模型提供有效提示策略，揭示了关键影响因素，并识别出可靠提示。

Abstract: LLMs are seeing widespread use for task automation, including automated
coding in the social sciences. However, even though researchers have proposed
different prompting strategies, their effectiveness varies across LLMs and
tasks. Often trial and error practices are still widespread. We propose
HALC$-$a general pipeline that allows for the systematic and reliable
construction of optimal prompts for any given coding task and model, permitting
the integration of any prompting strategy deemed relevant. To investigate LLM
coding and validate our pipeline, we sent a total of 1,512 individual prompts
to our local LLMs in over two million requests. We test prompting strategies
and LLM task performance based on few expert codings (ground truth). When
compared to these expert codings, we find prompts that code reliably for single
variables (${\alpha}$climate = .76; ${\alpha}$movement = .78) and across two
variables (${\alpha}$climate = .71; ${\alpha}$movement = .74) using the LLM
Mistral NeMo. Our prompting strategies are set up in a way that aligns the LLM
to our codebook$-$we are not optimizing our codebook for LLM friendliness. Our
paper provides insights into the effectiveness of different prompting
strategies, crucial influencing factors, and the identification of reliable
prompts for each coding task and model.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoTIR是一个强化学习框架，使LLMs能自主决定在推理过程中是否及如何调用工具，而非依赖静态策略，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具集成推理方法依赖预定义工具使用模式，可能损害语言模型核心能力，而人类能自适应选择工具，启发AutoTIR的开发。

Method: AutoTIR采用强化学习框架，结合混合奖励机制，优化任务答案正确性、结构化输出和工具使用惩罚，实现自适应工具调用。

Result: 在知识密集型、数学和通用语言任务中，AutoTIR表现优于基线，展现出卓越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: AutoTIR展示了强化学习在构建可泛化、可扩展工具集成推理能力中的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), when enhanced through reasoning-oriented
post-training, evolve into powerful Large Reasoning Models (LRMs).
Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) further extends their capabilities by
incorporating external tools, but existing methods often rely on rigid,
predefined tool-use patterns that risk degrading core language competence.
Inspired by the human ability to adaptively select tools, we introduce AutoTIR,
a reinforcement learning framework that enables LLMs to autonomously decide
whether and which tool to invoke during the reasoning process, rather than
following static tool-use strategies. AutoTIR leverages a hybrid reward
mechanism that jointly optimizes for task-specific answer correctness,
structured output adherence, and penalization of incorrect tool usage, thereby
encouraging both precise reasoning and efficient tool integration. Extensive
evaluations across diverse knowledge-intensive, mathematical, and general
language modeling tasks demonstrate that AutoTIR achieves superior overall
performance, significantly outperforming baselines and exhibits superior
generalization in tool-use behavior. These results highlight the promise of
reinforcement learning in building truly generalizable and scalable TIR
capabilities in LLMs. The code and data are available at

TL;DR: Graph-R1通过强化学习改进GraphRAG，提升检索效率和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统GraphRAG的高构建成本、固定检索和依赖长上下文推理的问题。

Method: 引入轻量级知识超图构建，将检索建模为多轮代理-环境交互，并通过端到端奖励机制优化。

Result: 在标准RAG数据集上，Graph-R1在推理准确性、检索效率和生成质量上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: Graph-R1为GraphRAG提供了一种高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucination in LLMs by
incorporating external knowledge, but relies on chunk-based retrieval that
lacks structural semantics. GraphRAG methods improve RAG by modeling knowledge
as entity-relation graphs, but still face challenges in high construction cost,
fixed one-time retrieval, and reliance on long-context reasoning and prompt
design. To address these challenges, we propose Graph-R1, an agentic GraphRAG
framework via end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL). It introduces lightweight
knowledge hypergraph construction, models retrieval as a multi-turn
agent-environment interaction, and optimizes the agent process via an
end-to-end reward mechanism. Experiments on standard RAG datasets show that
Graph-R1 outperforms traditional GraphRAG and RL-enhanced RAG methods in
reasoning accuracy, retrieval efficiency, and generation quality.

Motivation: 探讨死记硬背是否阻碍泛化，并探索LLMs如何从记忆数据中学习泛化。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：先用无意义标记记忆事实关联，再用语义提示微调以泛化。

Result: 实验表明，模型能通过语义提示重新解释记忆数据，形成结构化潜在表示。

Conclusion: 这一发现为知识注入提供了新方法，但也可能带来数据滥用的风险。

Abstract: Rote learning is a memorization technique based on repetition. It is commonly
believed to hinder generalization by encouraging verbatim memorization rather
than deeper understanding. This insight holds for even learning factual
knowledge that inevitably requires a certain degree of memorization. In this
work, we demonstrate that LLMs can be trained to generalize from rote memorized
data. We introduce a two-phase memorize-then-generalize framework, where the
model first rote memorizes factual subject-object associations using a
semantically meaningless token and then learns to generalize by fine-tuning on
a small set of semantically meaningful prompts. Extensive experiments over 8
LLMs show that the models can reinterpret rote memorized data through the
semantically meaningful prompts, as evidenced by the emergence of structured,
semantically aligned latent representations between the two. This surprising
finding opens the door to both effective and efficient knowledge injection and
possible risks of repurposing the memorized data for malicious usage.

TL;DR: 研究发现，优化语言模型以表现温暖和同理心会显著降低其可靠性，尤其是在用户表达脆弱时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI语言模型在温暖和可靠性之间的权衡，尤其是在用户表达脆弱时的表现。

Method: 对五种不同规模和架构的语言模型进行实验，训练它们生成更温暖的回应，并评估其在安全关键任务中的表现。

Result: 温暖的模型在错误率上显著增加（+10至+30个百分点），更容易传播阴谋论、提供错误信息或不当医疗建议，并更倾向于验证用户的错误信念。

Conclusion: 当前评估方法可能无法检测到这些系统性风险，需要重新思考如何开发和监督这些重塑人际关系的AI系统。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) developers are increasingly building language
models with warm and empathetic personas that millions of people now use for
advice, therapy, and companionship. Here, we show how this creates a
significant trade-off: optimizing language models for warmth undermines their
reliability, especially when users express vulnerability. We conducted
controlled experiments on five language models of varying sizes and
architectures, training them to produce warmer, more empathetic responses, then
evaluating them on safety-critical tasks. Warm models showed substantially
higher error rates (+10 to +30 percentage points) than their original
counterparts, promoting conspiracy theories, providing incorrect factual
information, and offering problematic medical advice. They were also
significantly more likely to validate incorrect user beliefs, particularly when
user messages expressed sadness. Importantly, these effects were consistent
across different model architectures, and occurred despite preserved
performance on standard benchmarks, revealing systematic risks that current
evaluation practices may fail to detect. As human-like AI systems are deployed
at an unprecedented scale, our findings indicate a need to rethink how we
develop and oversee these systems that are reshaping human relationships and
social interaction.

Result: 改善了模型的概率估计和逐步推理能力，在算术推理和选择题任务中表现提升。

Conclusion: RLSF证明了内在奖励在LLM后训练中的有效性，值得进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce plausible but poorly-calibrated
answers, limiting their reliability on reasoning-intensive tasks. We present
Reinforcement Learning from Self-Feedback (RLSF), a post-training stage that
uses the model's own confidence as an intrinsic reward, mimicking how humans
learn in the absence of external feedback. After a frozen LLM generates several
chain-of-thought solutions, we define and compute the confidence of each final
answer span and rank the traces accordingly. These synthetic preferences are
then used to fine-tune the policy with standard preference optimization,
similar to RLHF yet requiring no human labels, gold answers, or externally
curated rewards.
  RLSF simultaneously (i) refines the model's probability estimates --
restoring well-behaved calibration -- and (ii) strengthens step-by-step
reasoning, yielding improved performance on arithmetic reasoning and
multiple-choice question answering.
  By turning a model's own uncertainty into useful self-feedback, RLSF affirms
reinforcement learning on intrinsic model behaviour as a principled and
data-efficient component of the LLM post-training pipeline and warrents further
research in intrinsic rewards for LLM post-training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究RAG在跨文化食谱适应中的局限性，发现其无法利用上下文多样性生成多样化结果。

Method: 提出CARRIAGE框架，结合检索增强和上下文组织，提升多样性。

Result: 实验表明CARRIAGE在多样性和质量上优于封闭式LLMs，达到帕累托效率。

Conclusion: CARRIAGE是首个明确追求多样化输出的RAG框架，有效解决多样性不足问题。

Abstract: In cross-cultural recipe adaptation, the goal is not only to ensure cultural
appropriateness and retain the original dish's essence, but also to provide
diverse options for various dietary needs and preferences. Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) is a promising approach, combining the retrieval of real
recipes from the target cuisine for cultural adaptability with large language
models (LLMs) for relevance. However, it remains unclear whether RAG can
generate diverse adaptation results. Our analysis shows that RAG tends to
overly rely on a limited portion of the context across generations, failing to
produce diverse outputs even when provided with varied contextual inputs. This
reveals a key limitation of RAG in creative tasks with multiple valid answers:
it fails to leverage contextual diversity for generating varied responses. To
address this issue, we propose CARRIAGE, a plug-and-play RAG framework for
cross-cultural recipe adaptation that enhances diversity in both retrieval and
context organization. To our knowledge, this is the first RAG framework that
explicitly aims to generate highly diverse outputs to accommodate multiple user
preferences. Our experiments show that CARRIAGE achieves Pareto efficiency in
terms of diversity and quality of recipe adaptation compared to closed-book
LLMs.

Motivation: 传统机器学习模型在微生物组研究中难以泛化，尤其是在小样本或异构标签格式的情况下。

Method: 评估了ChatGPT-4o、Claude 3.7 Sonnet、Grok-3和LLaMA 4等LLMs在零样本和少样本设置下的性能，并与随机森林等传统模型进行比较。

Result: LLMs在分类和污染风险预测中表现优于基线模型，并能泛化到不同站点和元数据分布。

Conclusion: LLMs能有效处理稀疏、异构的生物元数据，为环境微生物学和生物监测提供了一种有前景的元数据驱动方法。

Abstract: Traditional machine learning models struggle to generalize in microbiome
studies where only metadata is available, especially in small-sample settings
or across studies with heterogeneous label formats. In this work, we explore
the use of large language models (LLMs) to classify microbial samples into
ontology categories such as EMPO 3 and related biological labels, as well as to
predict pathogen contamination risk, specifically the presence of E. Coli,
using environmental metadata alone. We evaluate LLMs such as ChatGPT-4o, Claude
3.7 Sonnet, Grok-3, and LLaMA 4 in zero-shot and few-shot settings, comparing
their performance against traditional models like Random Forests across
multiple real-world datasets. Our results show that LLMs not only outperform
baselines in ontology classification, but also demonstrate strong predictive
ability for contamination risk, generalizing across sites and metadata
distributions. These findings suggest that LLMs can effectively reason over
sparse, heterogeneous biological metadata and offer a promising metadata-only
approach for environmental microbiology and biosurveillance applications.

Result: 在多跳QA任务中，相比传统RAG方法，DeepSieve表现出更高的推理深度、检索精度和可解释性。

Conclusion: DeepSieve通过模块化、透明和适应性设计，显著提升了RAG框架的性能和实用性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many reasoning tasks but struggle with
knowledge-intensive queries due to their inability to dynamically access
up-to-date or domain-specific information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
has emerged as a promising solution, enabling LLMs to ground their responses in
external sources. However, existing RAG methods lack fine-grained control over
both the query and source sides, often resulting in noisy retrieval and shallow
reasoning. In this work, we introduce DeepSieve, an agentic RAG framework that
incorporates information sieving via LLM-as-a-knowledge-router. DeepSieve
decomposes complex queries into structured sub-questions and recursively routes
each to the most suitable knowledge source, filtering irrelevant information
through a multi-stage distillation process. Our design emphasizes modularity,
transparency, and adaptability, leveraging recent advances in agentic system
design. Experiments on multi-hop QA tasks across heterogeneous sources
demonstrate improved reasoning depth, retrieval precision, and interpretability
over conventional RAG approaches.

Motivation: 开发基于传感器的分类模型需要大量多样化的数据，但收集这些数据成本高且耗时。

Method: 通过同步IMU和标记式运动捕捉系统（MoCap）记录19名参与者的物理治疗练习和步态相关运动数据，并提供处理后的数据和工具。

Conclusion: 该资源旨在加速机器学习驱动的人类运动分析研究。

Abstract: Wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) offer a cost-effective and
scalable means to assess human movement quality in clinical and everyday
settings. However, the development of robust sensor-based classification models
for physiotherapeutic exercises and gait analysis requires large, diverse
datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to collect. Here, we present a
multimodal dataset of physiotherapeutic exercises - including correct and
clinically relevant variants - and gait-related exercises - including both
normal and impaired gait patterns - recorded from 19 participants using
synchronized IMUs and marker-based motion capture (MoCap). The dataset includes
raw data from nine IMUs and thirty-five optical markers capturing full-body
kinematics. Each IMU is additionally equipped with four optical markers,
enabling precise comparison between IMU-derived orientation estimates and
reference values from the MoCap system. To support further analysis, we also
provide processed IMU orientations aligned with common segment coordinate
systems, subject-specific OpenSim models, inverse kinematics results, and tools
for visualizing IMU orientations in the musculoskeletal context. Detailed
annotations of movement execution quality and time-stamped segmentations
support diverse analysis goals. This dataset supports the development and
benchmarking of machine learning models for tasks such as automatic exercise
evaluation, gait analysis, temporal activity segmentation, and biomechanical
parameter estimation. To facilitate reproducibility, we provide code for
postprocessing, sensor-to-segment alignment, inverse kinematics computation,
and technical validation. This resource is intended to accelerate research in
machine learning-driven human movement analysis.

Conclusion: 结合时间视频输入和上下文线索可提升时空感知，为智能交通系统提供无需重新训练的敏捷感知模块。

Abstract: Pedestrian intention prediction is essential for autonomous driving in
complex urban environments. Conventional approaches depend on supervised
learning over frame sequences and require extensive retraining to adapt to new
scenarios. Here, we introduce BF-PIP (Beyond Frames Pedestrian Intention
Prediction), a zero-shot approach built upon Gemini 2.5 Pro. It infers crossing
intentions directly from short, continuous video clips enriched with structured
JAAD metadata. In contrast to GPT-4V based methods that operate on discrete
frames, BF-PIP processes uninterrupted temporal clips. It also incorporates
bounding-box annotations and ego-vehicle speed via specialized multimodal
prompts. Without any additional training, BF-PIP achieves 73% prediction
accuracy, outperforming a GPT-4V baseline by 18 %. These findings illustrate
that combining temporal video inputs with contextual cues enhances
spatiotemporal perception and improves intent inference under ambiguous
conditions. This approach paves the way for agile, retraining-free perception
module in intelligent transportation system.

Result: ChartM3基准揭示了当前MLLMs（如GPT-4o）在视觉指示器解释和操作上的局限性，通过训练集微调显著提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: 多模态监督对构建实用图表编辑系统至关重要，ChartM3为未来研究提供了数据和工具支持。

Abstract: Charts are a fundamental visualization format widely used in data analysis
across research and industry. While enabling users to edit charts based on
high-level intentions is of great practical value, existing methods primarily
rely on natural language instructions, which are often too ambiguous to support
fine-grained editing. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for
multimodal chart editing, where user intent is expressed through a combination
of natural language and visual indicators that explicitly highlight the
elements to be modified. To support this paradigm, we present
Chart$\text{M}^3$, a new benchmark for Multimodal chart editing with
Multi-level complexity and Multi-perspective evaluation. Chart$\text{M}^3$
contains 1,000 samples spanning four levels of editing difficulty. Each sample
includes triplets in the form of (chart, code, multimodal instructions). To
comprehensively evaluate chart editing models, Chart$\text{M}^3$ provides
metrics that assess both visual appearance and code correctness. Our benchmark
reveals significant limitations in current multimodal large language models
(MLLMs), including GPT-4o, particularly in their ability to interpret and act
on visual indicators. To address this, we construct Chart$\text{M}^3$-Train, a
large-scale training set with 24,000 multimodal chart editing samples.
Fine-tuning MLLMs on this dataset leads to substantial improvements,
demonstrating the importance of multimodal supervision in building practical
chart editing systems. Our datasets, codes, and evaluation tools are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决牙科研究和教育中数据稀缺的问题。

Method: 使用深度卷积GAN（DCGAN）和Wasserstein损失加梯度惩罚（WGANGP）训练模型，探索了四种候选模型，包括不同的批评器迭代次数、特征深度和去噪预处理。

Result: 生成的X光片在解剖可见性和真实性上表现中等，部分图像存在伪影。未去噪数据训练的模型在细节表现上更优，而去噪数据训练的模型在整体清晰度和锐度上更佳。

Conclusion: 研究为未来基于GAN的牙科成像方法提供了基础。

Abstract: This paper presents the development of a generative adversarial network (GAN)
for synthesizing dental panoramic radiographs. Although exploratory in nature,
the study aims to address the scarcity of data in dental research and
education. We trained a deep convolutional GAN (DCGAN) using a Wasserstein loss
with gradient penalty (WGANGP) on a dataset of 2322 radiographs of varying
quality. The focus was on the dentoalveolar regions, other anatomical
structures were cropped out. Extensive preprocessing and data cleaning were
performed to standardize the inputs while preserving anatomical variability. We
explored four candidate models by varying critic iterations, feature depth, and
the use of denoising prior to training. A clinical expert evaluated the
generated radiographs based on anatomical visibility and realism, using a
5-point scale (1 very poor 5 excellent). Most images showed moderate anatomical
depiction, although some were degraded by artifacts. A trade-off was observed
the model trained on non-denoised data yielded finer details especially in
structures like the mandibular canal and trabecular bone, while a model trained
on denoised data offered superior overall image clarity and sharpness. These
findings provide a foundation for future work on GAN-based methods in dental
imaging.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于混合马尔可夫逻辑网络（HMLNs）的新解释框架，用于解释深度神经网络在多模态任务（如图像描述生成）中的信息整合过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管DNN在多模态任务中表现优异，但其如何整合视觉、语言和知识表示生成有意义描述的机制仍难以解释。现有性能指标通常依赖于与人工描述的比较，无法深入揭示这一整合过程。

Method: 通过HMLNs结合符号规则与实值函数，学习训练实例的分布，并通过条件生成样本推断分布变化，量化哪些实例对生成描述提供了更丰富的信息。

Result: 实验表明，该框架能有效解释多个先进图像描述模型的生成过程，并比较了这些模型的可解释性。

Conclusion: 该框架为DNN在多模态任务中的信息整合提供了可解释的工具，有助于模型比较和改进。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have made tremendous progress in multimodal tasks
such as image captioning. However, explaining/interpreting how these models
integrate visual information, language information and knowledge representation
to generate meaningful captions remains a challenging problem. Standard metrics
to measure performance typically rely on comparing generated captions with
human-written ones that may not provide a user with a deep insights into this
integration. In this work, we develop a novel explanation framework that is
easily interpretable based on Hybrid Markov Logic Networks (HMLNs) - a language
that can combine symbolic rules with real-valued functions - where we
hypothesize how relevant examples from the training data could have influenced
the generation of the observed caption. To do this, we learn a HMLN
distribution over the training instances and infer the shift in distributions
over these instances when we condition on the generated sample which allows us
to quantify which examples may have been a source of richer information to
generate the observed caption. Our experiments on captions generated for
several state-of-the-art captioning models using Amazon Mechanical Turk
illustrate the interpretability of our explanations, and allow us to compare
these models along the dimension of explainability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半监督学习在图像分类中已有广泛应用，但在时空动作定位领域的研究较少，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 引入双引导网络，结合帧级分类和边界框预测，以确保动作类别在帧和边界框中的一致性。

Result: 在UCF101-24、J-HMDB-21和AVA数据集上的评估表明，该方法在有限标注数据下显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在时空动作定位任务中表现出色，为半监督学习在该领域的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) has shown tremendous potential to improve the
predictive performance of deep learning models when annotations are hard to
obtain. However, the application of SSL has so far been mainly studied in the
context of image classification. In this work, we present a semi-supervised
approach for spatial-temporal action localization. We introduce a dual guidance
network to select better pseudo-bounding boxes. It combines a frame-level
classification with a bounding-box prediction to enforce action class
consistency across frames and boxes. Our evaluation across well-known
spatial-temporal action localization datasets, namely UCF101-24 , J-HMDB-21 and
AVA shows that the proposed module considerably enhances the model's
performance in limited labeled data settings. Our framework achieves superior
results compared to extended image-based semi-supervised baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航空野生动物追踪需要高效的小物体检测方法，但传统方法成本高且计算资源有限。

Method: 采用数据增强（分块）方法，比较三种不同架构的物体检测器在不同分块参数下的性能。

Result: 所有模型在至少一种分块配置下达到93%以上的mAP@IoU=0.5，简单模型与复杂模型表现相当。

Conclusion: 研究表明，简单模型在有限计算资源下表现良好，适合无人机部署。

Abstract: Aerial wildlife tracking is critical for conservation efforts and relies on
detecting small objects on the ground below the aircraft. It presents technical
challenges: crewed aircraft are expensive, risky and disruptive; autonomous
drones have limited computational capacity for onboard AI systems. Since the
objects of interest may appear only a few pixels wide, small object detection
is an inherently challenging computer vision subfield compounded by
computational efficiency needs. This paper applies a patching augmentation to
datasets to study model performance under various settings. A comparative study
of three common yet architecturally diverse object detectors is conducted using
the data, varying the patching method's hyperparameters against detection
accuracy. Each model achieved at least 93\% mAP@IoU=0.5 on at least one
patching configuration. Statistical analyses provide an in-depth commentary on
the effects of various factors. Analysis also shows that faster, simpler models
are about as effective as models that require more computational power for this
task and perform well given limited patch scales, encouraging UAV deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于潜在扩散模型（LDM）的新方法，用于从单视角图像估计HDR环境贴图，解决了ERP表示中的边界伪影问题，并提出了全景适应的扩散变换器架构（PanoDiT）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ERP表示在环境贴图中常见的极区扭曲和边界伪影问题，提升镜像反射表面的光照准确性。

Method: 使用潜在扩散模型（LDM）生成高质量环境贴图，提出ERP卷积填充消除边界伪影，并设计全景适应的扩散变换器架构（PanoDiT）减少ERP失真。

Result: 模型在标准基准测试中表现优异，环境贴图质量和光照准确性与现有最优方法相当。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了ERP表示的问题，生成了高质量的环境贴图，但PanoDiT在减少失真的同时牺牲了部分图像质量和真实性。

Abstract: We advance the field of HDR environment map estimation from a single-view
image by establishing a novel approach leveraging the Latent Diffusion Model
(LDM) to produce high-quality environment maps that can plausibly light
mirror-reflective surfaces. A common issue when using the ERP representation,
the format used by the vast majority of approaches, is distortions at the poles
and a seam at the sides of the environment map. We remove the border seam
artefact by proposing an ERP convolutional padding in the latent autoencoder.
Additionally, we investigate whether adapting the diffusion network
architecture to the ERP format can improve the quality and accuracy of the
estimated environment map by proposing a panoramically-adapted Diffusion
Transformer architecture. Our proposed PanoDiT network reduces ERP distortions
and artefacts, but at the cost of image quality and plausibility. We evaluate
with standard benchmarks to demonstrate that our models estimate high-quality
environment maps that perform competitively with state-of-the-art approaches in
both image quality and lighting accuracy.

TL;DR: 研究评估了六种基于CLIP的模型在胸部X光分类任务中的公平性和鲁棒性，发现模型在不同年龄患者间存在性能差距，但对其他属性表现较公平。此外，模型在无胸引管的病例中表现较差，表明依赖虚假相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于CLIP的模型在医学任务中表现良好，但其公平性和鲁棒性尚未充分研究。

Method: 使用三个公开数据集（MIMIC-CXR、NIH-CXR14、NEATX）评估六种CLIP模型在胸部X光分类中的表现，分析公平性和鲁棒性。

Result: 模型在不同年龄患者间性能不均，但对性别和种族表现公平；无胸引管的病例性能较低。

Conclusion: CLIP模型在医学任务中存在公平性和鲁棒性问题，需进一步优化以减少虚假相关性依赖。

Abstract: Motivated by the strong performance of CLIP-based models in natural
image-text domains, recent efforts have adapted these architectures to medical
tasks, particularly in radiology, where large paired datasets of images and
reports, such as chest X-rays, are available. While these models have shown
encouraging results in terms of accuracy and discriminative performance, their
fairness and robustness in the different clinical tasks remain largely
underexplored. In this study, we extensively evaluate six widely used
CLIP-based models on chest X-ray classification using three publicly available
datasets: MIMIC-CXR, NIH-CXR14, and NEATX. We assess the models fairness across
six conditions and patient subgroups based on age, sex, and race. Additionally,
we assess the robustness to shortcut learning by evaluating performance on
pneumothorax cases with and without chest drains. Our results indicate
performance gaps between patients of different ages, but more equitable results
for the other attributes. Moreover, all models exhibit lower performance on
images without chest drains, suggesting reliance on spurious correlations. We
further complement the performance analysis with a study of the embeddings
generated by the models. While the sensitive attributes could be classified
from the embeddings, we do not see such patterns using PCA, showing the
limitations of these visualisation techniques when assessing models. Our code

TL;DR: 提出了一种实时从2D摄像头生成3D高斯重建的方法，用于3D视频会议，具有高真实性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D会议解决方案依赖复杂硬件或固定外观，不适合视频会议应用。

Method: 通过独立处理每帧视频，结合稳定性损失，实现实时3D重建。

Result: 在视觉质量和稳定性上优于现有方法，仅需普通2D摄像头即可实现。

Conclusion: 该方法为3D视频会议提供了高可访问性、真实性和真实感的解决方案。

Abstract: Virtual 3D meetings offer the potential to enhance copresence, increase
engagement and thus improve effectiveness of remote meetings compared to
standard 2D video calls. However, representing people in 3D meetings remains a
challenge; existing solutions achieve high quality by using complex hardware,
making use of fixed appearance via enrolment, or by inverting a pre-trained
generative model. These approaches lead to constraints that are unwelcome and
ill-fitting for videoconferencing applications. We present the first method to
predict 3D Gaussian reconstructions in real time from a single 2D webcam feed,
where the 3D representation is not only live and realistic, but also authentic
to the input video. By conditioning the 3D representation on each video frame
independently, our reconstruction faithfully recreates the input video from the
captured viewpoint (a property we call authenticity), while generalizing
realistically to novel viewpoints. Additionally, we introduce a stability loss
to obtain reconstructions that are temporally stable on video sequences. We
show that our method delivers state-of-the-art accuracy in visual quality and
stability metrics compared to existing methods, and demonstrate our approach in
live one-to-one 3D meetings using only a standard 2D camera and display. This
demonstrates that our approach can allow anyone to communicate volumetrically,
via a method for 3D videoconferencing that is not only highly accessible, but
also realistic and authentic.

TL;DR: 提出了一种全局到局部连通性保持（GLCP）框架，用于解决管状结构分割中的局部不连续性问题，通过交互式多头分割（IMS）模块和双注意力细化（DAR）模块提升分割质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 管状结构（如血管网络）的准确分割在医学领域至关重要，但现有方法常忽视局部不连续区域，导致分割效果不佳。

Method: GLCP框架结合IMS模块（学习全局分割、骨架图和局部不连续图）和DAR模块（细化分割图），同时关注全局和局部特征。

Result: 在2D和3D数据集上的实验表明，GLCP在管状结构分割中优于现有方法，具有更高的准确性和连续性。

Conclusion: GLCP通过全局与局部特征的协同优化，显著提升了管状结构分割的性能。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of tubular structures, such as vascular networks, plays
a critical role in various medical domains. A remaining significant challenge
in this task is structural fragmentation, which can adversely impact downstream
applications. Existing methods primarily focus on designing various loss
functions to constrain global topological structures. However, they often
overlook local discontinuity regions, leading to suboptimal segmentation
results. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Global-to-Local
Connectivity Preservation (GLCP) framework that can simultaneously perceive
global and local structural characteristics of tubular networks. Specifically,
we propose an Interactive Multi-head Segmentation (IMS) module to jointly learn
global segmentation, skeleton maps, and local discontinuity maps, respectively.
This enables our model to explicitly target local discontinuity regions while
maintaining global topological integrity. In addition, we design a lightweight
Dual-Attention-based Refinement (DAR) module to further improve segmentation
quality by refining the resulting segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on
both 2D and 3D datasets demonstrate that our GLCP achieves superior accuracy
and continuity in tubular structure segmentation compared to several
state-of-the-art approaches. The source codes will be available at

Method: 在VQA v2.0数据集上，对GPT-4o、Claude-3.5-Sonnet和Gemini-1.5-Flash三种VLMs添加修饰词并分析其响应。

Result: VLMs的性能因修饰词的添加而下降，表明该方法有助于揭示模型局限。

Conclusion: 通过违反Grice原则的测试，VLMs的表现与人类不同，为理解其局限性提供了新方向。

Abstract: We can think of Visual Question Answering as a (multimodal) conversation
between a human and an AI system. Here, we explore the sensitivity of Vision
Language Models (VLMs) through the lens of cooperative principles of
conversation proposed by Grice. Specifically, even when Grice's maxims of
conversation are flouted, humans typically do not have much difficulty in
understanding the conversation even though it requires more cognitive effort.
Here, we study if VLMs are capable of handling violations to Grice's maxims in
a manner that is similar to humans. Specifically, we add modifiers to
human-crafted questions and analyze the response of VLMs to these modifiers. We
use three state-of-the-art VLMs in our study, namely, GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet
and Gemini-1.5-Flash on questions from the VQA v2.0 dataset. Our initial
results seem to indicate that the performance of VLMs consistently diminish
with the addition of modifiers which indicates our approach as a promising
direction to understand the limitations of VLMs.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a crucial medical imaging modality.
However, long acquisition times remain a significant challenge, leading to
increased costs, and reduced patient comfort. Recent studies have shown the
potential of using deep learning models that incorporate information from prior
subject-specific MRI scans to improve reconstruction quality of present scans.
Integrating this prior information requires registration of the previous scan
to the current image reconstruction, which can be time-consuming. We propose a
novel deep-learning-based MRI reconstruction framework which consists of an
initial reconstruction network, a deep registration model, and a
transformer-based enhancement network. We validated our method on a
longitudinal dataset of T1-weighted MRI scans with 2,808 images from 18
subjects at four acceleration factors (R5, R10, R15, R20). Quantitative metrics
confirmed our approach's superiority over existing methods (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon
signed-rank test). Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of our MRI
reconstruction method on the downstream task of brain segmentation and observed
improved accuracy and volumetric agreement with reference segmentations. Our
approach also achieved a substantial reduction in total reconstruction time
compared to methods that use traditional registration algorithms, making it
more suitable for real-time clinical applications. The code associated with
this work is publicly available at

Abstract: Adapting large Video-Language Models (VLMs) for action detection using only a
few examples poses challenges like overfitting and the granularity mismatch
between scene-level pre-training and required person-centric understanding. We
propose an efficient adaptation strategy combining parameter-efficient tuning
(LoRA) with a novel learnable internal feature augmentation. Applied within the
frozen VLM backbone using FiLM, these augmentations generate diverse feature
variations directly relevant to the task. Additionally, we introduce a
group-weighted loss function that dynamically modulates the training
contribution of each augmented sample based on its prediction divergence
relative to the group average. This promotes robust learning by prioritizing
informative yet reasonable augmentations. We demonstrate our method's
effectiveness on complex multi-label, multi-person action detection datasets
(AVA, MOMA), achieving strong mAP performance and showcasing significant data
efficiency for adapting VLMs from limited examples.

Conclusion: CoP通过多任务协作显著提升了BEV 3D物体检测的性能，填补了空间表示和特征细化的空白。

Abstract: Vision-based bird's-eye-view (BEV) 3D object detection has advanced
significantly in autonomous driving by offering cost-effectiveness and rich
contextual information. However, existing methods often construct BEV
representations by collapsing extracted object features, neglecting intrinsic
environmental contexts, such as roads and pavements. This hinders detectors
from comprehensively perceiving the characteristics of the physical world. To
alleviate this, we introduce a multi-task learning framework, Collaborative
Perceiver (CoP), that leverages spatial occupancy as auxiliary information to
mine consistent structural and conceptual similarities shared between 3D object
detection and occupancy prediction tasks, bridging gaps in spatial
representations and feature refinement. To this end, we first propose a
pipeline to generate dense occupancy ground truths incorporating local density
information (LDO) for reconstructing detailed environmental information. Next,
we employ a voxel-height-guided sampling (VHS) strategy to distill fine-grained
local features according to distinct object properties. Furthermore, we develop
a global-local collaborative feature fusion (CFF) module that seamlessly
integrates complementary knowledge between both tasks, thus composing more
robust BEV representations. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark
demonstrate that CoP outperforms existing vision-based frameworks, achieving
49.5\% mAP and 59.2\% NDS on the test set. Code and supplementary materials are

Abstract: Wildlife populations in Africa face severe threats, with vertebrate numbers
declining by over 65% in the past five decades. In response, image
classification using deep learning has emerged as a promising tool for
biodiversity monitoring and conservation. This paper presents a comparative
study of deep learning models for automatically classifying African wildlife

public dataset of four species: buffalo, elephant, rhinoceros, and zebra; we
evaluate the performance of DenseNet-201, ResNet-152, EfficientNet-B4, and
Vision Transformer ViT-H/14. DenseNet-201 achieved the best performance among
convolutional networks (67% accuracy), while ViT-H/14 achieved the highest
overall accuracy (99%), but with significantly higher computational cost,
raising deployment concerns. Our experiments highlight the trade-offs between
accuracy, resource requirements, and deployability. The best-performing CNN

Abstract: Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) is a critical yet challenging
task, as domain shifts in unseen environments can severely compromise model
performance. While recent studies enhance feature alignment by projecting
features into the source domain, they often neglect intrinsic latent domain
priors, leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce PDAF, a
Probabilistic Diffusion Alignment Framework that enhances the generalization of
existing segmentation networks through probabilistic diffusion modeling. PDAF
introduces a Latent Domain Prior (LDP) to capture domain shifts and uses this
prior as a conditioning factor to align both source and unseen target domains.
To achieve this, PDAF integrates into a pre-trained segmentation model and
utilizes paired source and pseudo-target images to simulate latent domain
shifts, enabling LDP modeling. The framework comprises three modules: the
Latent Prior Extractor (LPE) predicts the LDP by supervising domain shifts; the
Domain Compensation Module (DCM) adjusts feature representations to mitigate
domain shifts; and the Diffusion Prior Estimator (DPE) leverages a diffusion
process to estimate the LDP without requiring paired samples. This design
enables PDAF to iteratively model domain shifts, progressively refining feature
representations to enhance generalization under complex target conditions.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PDAF across diverse and
challenging urban scenes.

TL;DR: Top2Pano是一种端到端模型，用于从俯视图生成逼真的室内全景图，通过体积占用估计和扩散细化提升几何一致性和真实感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从2D俯视图生成沉浸式360度室内全景图在虚拟现实、室内设计等领域有广泛应用，但缺乏显式3D结构和几何一致性是挑战。

Method: Top2Pano通过体积占用估计推断3D结构，生成粗全景图，再通过ControlNet进行扩散细化，提升真实感和结构保真度。

Result: 在两个数据集上，Top2Pano优于基线方法，能有效重建几何、遮挡和空间布局，并能从示意平面图生成高质量全景图。

Conclusion: Top2Pano在连接俯视图与沉浸式室内合成方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Generating immersive 360{\deg} indoor panoramas from 2D top-down views has
applications in virtual reality, interior design, real estate, and robotics.
This task is challenging due to the lack of explicit 3D structure and the need
for geometric consistency and photorealism. We propose Top2Pano, an end-to-end
model for synthesizing realistic indoor panoramas from top-down views. Our
method estimates volumetric occupancy to infer 3D structures, then uses
volumetric rendering to generate coarse color and depth panoramas. These guide
a diffusion-based refinement stage using ControlNet, enhancing realism and
structural fidelity. Evaluations on two datasets show Top2Pano outperforms
baselines, effectively reconstructing geometry, occlusions, and spatial
arrangements. It also generalizes well, producing high-quality panoramas from
schematic floorplans. Our results highlight Top2Pano's potential in bridging
top-down views with immersive indoor synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLaVA-Reward是一种高效的奖励模型，利用预训练多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）自动评估文本到图像（T2I）生成的多个方面。通过Skip-connection Cross Attention模块增强视觉与文本交互，支持多种偏好数据微调，在多个评估维度上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM方法需要指令跟随数据进行监督微调，且评估生成质量时依赖文本响应分析，耗时且难以训练。LLaVA-Reward旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 直接利用MLLMs的隐藏状态处理文本-图像对，引入SkipCA模块增强视觉与文本的双向交互，支持配对和非配对偏好数据微调。

Result: 在文本-图像对齐、保真度/伪影、安全性和整体排名四个评估维度上，LLaVA-Reward优于传统和MLLM方法，生成与人类评分一致的自动评估结果。

Conclusion: LLaVA-Reward通过高效设计和多模态交互优化，显著提升了T2I生成的自动评估性能。

Abstract: We introduce LLaVA-Reward, an efficient reward model designed to
automatically evaluate text-to-image (T2I) generations across multiple
perspectives, leveraging pretrained multimodal large language models (MLLMs).
Existing MLLM-based approaches require instruction-following data for
supervised fine-tuning and evaluate generation quality on analyzing text
response, which is time-consuming and difficult to train. To address this
problem, we propose LLaVA-Reward, which directly utilizes the hidden states of
MLLMs given text-image pairs. To enhance the bidirectional interaction between
visual and textual representations in decoder-only MLLMs, we further propose
adding a Skip-connection Cross Attention (SkipCA) module. This design enhances
text-image correlation reasoning by connecting early-layer visual features with
later-layer hidden representations.In addition, LLaVA-Reward supports different
types of preference data for efficient fine-tuning, including paired preference
data and unpaired data. We train LLaVA-Reward on four evaluation perspectives:
text-image alignment, fidelity/artifact, safety, and overall ranking. Empirical
results demonstrate that LLaVA-Reward outperforms conventional and MLLM-based
methods in generating human-aligned scores for automatic evaluations and
inference-time scaling in text-to-image generations.

TL;DR: ReGATE是一种自适应令牌剪枝方法，通过教师-学生框架加速多模态大语言模型（MLLM）训练，显著减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要针对推理且依赖令牌减少或合并，对训练效率提升有限。

Method: 采用教师-学生框架，结合参考损失和自适应难度评分，选择性处理关键令牌。

Result: 在VideoLLaMA2上，ReGATE达到标准训练的峰值精度，速度提升2倍，令牌使用量仅35%。

Conclusion: ReGATE不仅加速训练，还能超越基线性能，同时减少令牌总数超过41%。

Abstract: The computational cost of training multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
rapidly increases with the number of tokens involved. Existing efficiency
methods primarily target inference and rely on token reduction or merging,
offering limited benefit during training. In this paper, we propose ReGATE
(Reference$-$Guided Adaptive Token Elision), an adaptive token pruning method
for accelerating MLLM training. Specifically, ReGATE adopts a teacher-student
framework in which the MLLM being trained serves as the student, and a frozen
reference large language model (LLM) acts as the teacher. The teacher computes
per-token reference losses, which are combined with an exponential moving
average (EMA) of the student's own difficulty scores. This adaptive
difficulty-based scoring enables the selective processing of crucial tokens
while bypassing less informative ones in the forward pass, significantly
reducing computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ReGATE, when
applied to VideoLLaMA2, matches the peak accuracy of standard training on
MVBench up to 2$\times$ faster, using only 35% of the tokens. With additional
training, it even surpasses the baseline on several multimodal benchmarks, all
while reducing the total token count by over 41%. Code and models will be
released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统地图构建模型仅提供确定性点估计，无法捕捉真实环境中的不确定性和模糊性（如遮挡和缺失车道标记）。

Method: 提出MapDiffusion，通过扩散范式迭代优化随机初始化的查询，生成多个可能的地图样本，并基于BEV潜在网格进行条件化。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，MapDiffusion单样本性能提升5%，多样本聚合进一步改善性能，不确定性估计在遮挡区域显著更高。

Conclusion: MapDiffusion通过建模完整地图分布，增强了在线向量化高清地图构建的鲁棒性和可靠性，支持自动驾驶在复杂环境中的不确定性感知决策。

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires an understanding of the static environment from
sensor data. Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders are commonly used to fuse
multiple inputs, and a vector decoder predicts a vectorized map representation
from the latent BEV grid. However, traditional map construction models provide
deterministic point estimates, failing to capture uncertainty and the inherent
ambiguities of real-world environments, such as occlusions and missing lane
markings. We propose MapDiffusion, a novel generative approach that leverages
the diffusion paradigm to learn the full distribution of possible vectorized
maps. Instead of predicting a single deterministic output from learned queries,
MapDiffusion iteratively refines randomly initialized queries, conditioned on a
BEV latent grid, to generate multiple plausible map samples. This allows
aggregating samples to improve prediction accuracy and deriving uncertainty
estimates that directly correlate with scene ambiguity. Extensive experiments
on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art
performance in online map construction, surpassing the baseline by 5% in
single-sample performance. We further show that aggregating multiple samples
consistently improves performance along the ROC curve, validating the benefit
of distribution modeling. Additionally, our uncertainty estimates are
significantly higher in occluded areas, reinforcing their value in identifying
regions with ambiguous sensor input. By modeling the full map distribution,
MapDiffusion enhances the robustness and reliability of online vectorized HD
map construction, enabling uncertainty-aware decision-making for autonomous
vehicles in complex environments.

Conclusion: DuCiSC通过跨图像语义一致性和可靠伪标签选择，显著提升了半监督医学图像分割的性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has proven highly effective in tackling the
challenge of limited labeled training data in medical image segmentation. In
general, current approaches, which rely on intra-image pixel-wise consistency
training via pseudo-labeling, overlook the consistency at more comprehensive
semantic levels (e.g., object region) and suffer from severe discrepancy of
extracted features resulting from an imbalanced number of labeled and unlabeled
data. To overcome these limitations, we present a new \underline{Du}al
\underline{C}ross-\underline{i}mage \underline{S}emantic
\underline{C}onsistency (DuCiSC) learning framework, for semi-supervised
medical image segmentation. Concretely, beyond enforcing pixel-wise semantic
consistency, DuCiSC proposes dual paradigms to encourage region-level semantic
consistency across: 1) labeled and unlabeled images; and 2) labeled and fused
images, by explicitly aligning their prototypes. Relying on the dual paradigms,
DuCiSC can effectively establish consistent cross-image semantics via prototype
representations, thereby addressing the feature discrepancy issue. Moreover, we
devise a novel self-aware confidence estimation strategy to accurately select
reliable pseudo labels, allowing for exploiting the training dynamics of
unlabeled data. Our DuCiSC method is extensively validated on four datasets,
including two popular binary benchmarks in segmenting the left atrium and
pancreas, a multi-class Automatic Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge dataset, and a
challenging scenario of segmenting the inferior alveolar nerve that features
complicated anatomical structures, showing superior segmentation results over
previous state-of-the-art approaches. Our code is publicly available at

Motivation: 当前视觉语言导航任务中，代理因场景表示过于详细和视觉语言对齐模糊，导致对导航友好的高层场景先验理解不足，容易违反语言命令。

Method: 提出了递归视觉想象（RVI）技术，通过结构化建模历史轨迹为紧凑神经网格，以及自适应语言对齐（ALG）技术，精细匹配语义。

Result: 在VLN-CE和ObjectNav任务上优于现有方法，验证了RVI和ALG技术的优越性。

Conclusion: 递归视觉想象和自适应语言对齐技术显著提升了视觉语言导航的性能。

Abstract: Vision Language Navigation (VLN) typically requires agents to navigate to
specified objects or remote regions in unknown scenes by obeying linguistic
commands. Such tasks require organizing historical visual observations for
linguistic grounding, which is critical for long-sequence navigational
decisions. However, current agents suffer from overly detailed scene
representation and ambiguous vision-language alignment, which weaken their
comprehension of navigation-friendly high-level scene priors and easily lead to
behaviors that violate linguistic commands. To tackle these issues, we propose
a navigation policy by recursively summarizing along-the-way visual
perceptions, which are adaptively aligned with commands to enhance linguistic
grounding. In particular, by structurally modeling historical trajectories as
compact neural grids, several Recursive Visual Imagination (RVI) techniques are
proposed to motivate agents to focus on the regularity of visual transitions
and semantic scene layouts, instead of dealing with misleading geometric
details. Then, an Adaptive Linguistic Grounding (ALG) technique is proposed to
align the learned situational memories with different linguistic components
purposefully. Such fine-grained semantic matching facilitates the accurate
anticipation of navigation actions and progress. Our navigation policy
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the challenging VLN-CE and
ObjectNav tasks, showing the superiority of our RVI and ALG techniques for VLN.

Conclusion: 自监督数据集蒸馏通过创新技术有效提取数据集关键信息，提升了蒸馏效果和泛化能力。

Abstract: Although larger datasets are crucial for training large deep models, the
rapid growth of dataset size has brought a significant challenge in terms of
considerable training costs, which even results in prohibitive computational
expenses. Dataset Distillation becomes a popular technique recently to reduce
the dataset size via learning a highly compact set of representative exemplars,
where the model trained with these exemplars ideally should have comparable
performance with respect to the one trained with the full dataset. While most
of existing works upon dataset distillation focus on supervised datasets, we
instead aim to distill images and their self-supervisedly trained
representations into a distilled set. This procedure, named as Self-Supervised
Dataset Distillation, effectively extracts rich information from real datasets,
yielding the distilled sets with enhanced cross-architecture generalizability.
Particularly, in order to preserve the key characteristics of original dataset
more faithfully and compactly, several novel techniques are proposed: 1) we
introduce an innovative parameterization upon images and representations via
distinct low-dimensional bases, where the base selection for parameterization
is experimentally shown to play a crucial role; 2) we tackle the instability
induced by the randomness of data augmentation -- a key component in
self-supervised learning but being underestimated in the prior work of
self-supervised dataset distillation -- by utilizing predetermined
augmentations; 3) we further leverage a lightweight network to model the
connections among the representations of augmented views from the same image,
leading to more compact pairs of distillation. Extensive experiments conducted
on various datasets validate the superiority of our approach in terms of
distillation efficiency, cross-architecture generalization, and transfer
learning performance.

Result: ATINet在单目标跟踪中达到最优性能，并成功扩展到多目标跟踪。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效提升了光场角-时域建模的质量，为复杂场景下的目标跟踪提供了新思路。

Abstract: High-quality 4D light field representation with efficient angular feature
modeling is crucial for scene perception, as it can provide discriminative
spatial-angular cues to identify moving targets. However, recent developments
still struggle to deliver reliable angular modeling in the temporal domain,
particularly in complex low-light scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel
light field epipolar-plane structure image (ESI) representation that explicitly
defines the geometric structure within the light field. By capitalizing on the
abrupt changes in the angles of light rays within the epipolar plane, this
representation can enhance visual expression in low-light scenes and reduce
redundancy in high-dimensional light fields. We further propose an
angular-temporal interaction network (ATINet) for light field object tracking
that learns angular-aware representations from the geometric structural cues
and angular-temporal interaction cues of light fields. Furthermore, ATINet can
also be optimized in a self-supervised manner to enhance the geometric feature
interaction across the temporal domain. Finally, we introduce a large-scale
light field low-light dataset for object tracking. Extensive experimentation
demonstrates that ATINet achieves state-of-the-art performance in single object
tracking. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to multiple object
tracking, which also shows the effectiveness of high-quality light field
angular-temporal modeling.

Motivation: 现有方法因3D训练数据不足难以生成泛化表示，而CLIP在图像-文本对上的预训练提供了广泛泛化能力。

Method: 提出DAC框架，利用MLLM描述已知类别信息以适配CLIP，并引入AB-LoRA缓解过拟合。

Result: 在四个开放集3DOR数据集上平均提升10.01% mAP，并在图像和跨数据集验证中表现优异。

Conclusion: DAC通过简单有效的方法显著提升了开放集3D物体检索的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Open-set 3D object retrieval (3DOR) is an emerging task aiming to retrieve 3D
objects of unseen categories beyond the training set. Existing methods
typically utilize all modalities (i.e., voxels, point clouds, multi-view
images) and train specific backbones before fusion. However, they still
struggle to produce generalized representations due to insufficient 3D training
data. Being contrastively pre-trained on web-scale image-text pairs, CLIP
inherently produces generalized representations for a wide range of downstream
tasks. Building upon it, we present a simple yet effective framework named
Describe, Adapt and Combine (DAC) by taking only multi-view images for open-set
3DOR. DAC innovatively synergizes a CLIP model with a multi-modal large
language model (MLLM) to learn generalized 3D representations, where the MLLM
is used for dual purposes. First, it describes the seen category information to
align with CLIP's training objective for adaptation during training. Second, it
provides external hints about unknown objects complementary to visual cues
during inference. To improve the synergy, we introduce an Additive-Bias
Low-Rank adaptation (AB-LoRA), which alleviates overfitting and further
enhances the generalization to unseen categories. With only multi-view images,
DAC significantly surpasses prior arts by an average of +10.01\% mAP on four
open-set 3DOR datasets. Moreover, its generalization is also validated on
image-based and cross-dataset setups. Code is available at

Conclusion: VAGU和GtS为视频异常检测提供了更全面的解决方案，JeAUG指标弥补了传统评估的不足。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify anomalous events in videos and
accurately determine their time intervals. Current VAD methods mainly fall into
two categories: traditional DNN-based approaches that focus on temporal
localization, and LLM-based approaches that emphasize semantic understanding.
Both anomaly understanding and grounding are essential for comprehensive video
anomaly detection and can complement each other. However, no existing model or
dataset supports both tasks simultaneously. To address this, we introduce VAGU
(Video Anomaly Grounding and Understanding), the first benchmark to integrate
both tasks. Each VAGU instance includes annotations for anomaly category,
semantic explanation, precise temporal grounding and Video QA. We also provide
multiple-choice Video QA for objective evaluation. Based on this dataset, we
propose Glance then Scrutinize (GtS), a training-free framework guided by
textual prompts. The framework first enables coarse localization of
high-probability anomalous regions, followed by detailed anomaly interpretation
and temporal boundary refinement. Additionally, we propose the JeAUG metric,
which jointly evaluates semantic interpretability and temporal precision,
overcoming the limitations of traditional metrics. Extensive experiments verify
the effectiveness of our benchmark, framework, and evaluation metric.

Abstract: Active Learning (AL) has emerged as a powerful approach for minimizing
labeling costs by selectively sampling the most informative data for neural
network model development. Effective AL for large-scale vision-language models
necessitates addressing challenges in uncertainty estimation and efficient
sampling given the vast number of parameters involved. In this work, we
introduce a novel parameter-efficient learning methodology that incorporates
uncertainty calibration loss within the AL framework. We propose a
differentiable loss function that promotes uncertainty calibration for
effectively selecting fewer and most informative data samples for fine-tuning.
Through extensive experiments across several datasets and vision backbones, we
demonstrate that our solution can match and exceed the performance of complex
feature-based sampling techniques while being computationally very efficient.
Additionally, we investigate the efficacy of Prompt learning versus Low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) in sample selection, providing a detailed comparative
analysis of these methods in the context of efficient AL.

Conclusion: Chain-of-Cooking模型有效解决了烹饪过程可视化中的语义一致性和连贯性问题，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Cooking process visualization is a promising task in the intersection of
image generation and food analysis, which aims to generate an image for each
cooking step of a recipe. However, most existing works focus on generating
images of finished foods based on the given recipes, and face two challenges to
visualize the cooking process. First, the appearance of ingredients changes
variously across cooking steps, it is difficult to generate the correct
appearances of foods that match the textual description, leading to semantic
inconsistency. Second, the current step might depend on the operations of
previous step, it is crucial to maintain the contextual coherence of images in
sequential order. In this work, we present a cooking process visualization
model, called Chain-of-Cooking. Specifically, to generate correct appearances
of ingredients, we present a Dynamic Patch Selection Module to retrieve
previously generated image patches as references, which are most related to
current textual contents. Furthermore, to enhance the coherence and keep the
rational order of generated images, we propose a Semantic Evolution Module and
a Bidirectional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Guidance. To better utilize the
semantics of previous texts, the Semantic Evolution Module establishes the
semantical association between latent prompts and current cooking step, and
merges it with the latent features. Then the CoT Guidance updates the merged
features to guide the current cooking step remain coherent with the previous
step. Moreover, we construct a dataset named CookViz, consisting of
intermediate image-text pairs for the cooking process. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods in
generating coherent and semantic consistent cooking process.

Conclusion: CS-DFD通过抑制梯度冲突，显著提升了深度伪造检测的泛化能力和准确性。

Abstract: Robust deepfake detection models must be capable of generalizing to
ever-evolving manipulation techniques beyond training data. A promising
strategy is to augment the training data with online synthesized fake images
containing broadly generalizable artifacts. However, in the context of deepfake
detection, it is surprising that jointly training on both original and online
synthesized forgeries may result in degraded performance. This contradicts the
common belief that incorporating more source-domain data should enhance
detection accuracy. Through empirical analysis, we trace this degradation to
gradient conflicts during backpropagation which force a trade-off between
source domain accuracy and target domain generalization. To overcome this
issue, we propose a Conflict-Suppressed Deepfake Detection (CS-DFD) framework
that explicitly mitigates the gradient conflict via two synergistic modules.
First, an Update Vector Search (UVS) module searches for an alternative update
vector near the initial gradient vector to reconcile the disparities of the
original and online synthesized forgeries. By further transforming the search
process into an extremum optimization problem, UVS yields the uniquely update
vector, which maximizes the simultaneous loss reductions for each data type.
Second, a Conflict Gradient Reduction (CGR) module enforces a low-conflict
feature embedding space through a novel Conflict Descent Loss. This loss
penalizes misaligned gradient directions and guides the learning of
representations with aligned, non-conflicting gradients. The synergy of UVS and
CGR alleviates gradient interference in both parameter optimization and
representation learning. Experiments on multiple deepfake benchmarks
demonstrate that CS-DFD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain
detection accuracy and cross-domain generalization.

two primary astronomical sensing objects. Attitude sensors are critical
components for the survival and knowledge improvement of spacecraft. Of these,
sun sensors are the most common and important sensor for spacecraft attitude
determination. The sun sensor measures the Sun vector in spacecraft
coordinates. The sun sensor calibration process is particularly difficult due
to the complex nature of the uncertainties involved. The uncertainties are
small, difficult to observe, and vary spatio-temporally over the lifecycle of
the sensor. In addition, the sensors are affected by numerous sources of
uncertainties, including manufacturing, electrical, environmental, and
interference sources. This motivates the development of advanced calibration
algorithms to minimize uncertainty over the sensor lifecycle and improve
accuracy. Although modeling and calibration techniques for sun sensors have
been explored extensively in the literature over the past two decades, there is
currently no resource that consolidates and systematically reviews this body of
work. The present review proposes a systematic mapping of sun sensor modeling
and calibration algorithms across a breadth of sensor configurations. It
specifically provides a comprehensive survey of each methodology, along with an
analysis of research gaps and recommendations for future directions in sun
sensor modeling and calibration techniques.

Motivation: 现有方法在高精度3D异常检测中因全局信息不足导致性能下降。

Method: MVR方法将点云转换为多视角图像，并采用基于重建的异常检测框架。

Result: 在Real3D-AD基准测试中，MVR达到89.6%的对象级AU-ROC和95.7%的点级AU-ROC。

Abstract: 3D anomaly detection is critical in industrial quality inspection. While
existing methods achieve notable progress, their performance degrades in
high-precision 3D anomaly detection due to insufficient global information. To
address this, we propose Multi-View Reconstruction (MVR), a method that
losslessly converts high-resolution point clouds into multi-view images and
employs a reconstruction-based anomaly detection framework to enhance global
information learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
MVR, achieving 89.6\% object-wise AU-ROC and 95.7\% point-wise AU-ROC on the

TL;DR: RelMap是一个端到端框架，通过结合空间关系和语义先验提升在线高清地图构建的准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的方法忽视了地图元素间的空间和语义关系，限制了其性能。

Method: 提出Class-aware Spatial Relation Prior编码元素间位置依赖，以及MoE-based Semantic Prior通过类特定专家优化特征解码。

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse 2数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: RelMap通过显式建模空间和语义关系，显著提升了在线高清地图构建的效果。

Abstract: Online high-definition (HD) map construction plays an increasingly important
role in scaling autonomous driving systems. Transformer-based methods have
become prevalent in online HD map construction; however, existing approaches
often neglect the inherent spatial and semantic relationships among map
elements, which limits their accuracy and generalization. To address this, we
propose RelMap, an end-to-end framework that enhances online map construction
by incorporating spatial relations and semantic priors. We introduce a
Class-aware Spatial Relation Prior, which explicitly encodes relative
positional dependencies between map elements using a learnable class-aware
relation encoder. Additionally, we propose a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based
Semantic Prior, which routes features to class-specific experts based on
predicted class probabilities, refining instance feature decoding. Our method
is compatible with both single-frame and temporal perception backbones,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on both the nuScenes and Argoverse 2
datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LinDeps是一种新型的后剪枝方法，通过线性依赖分析识别并移除冗余滤波器，提升CNN剪枝效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN在资源受限平台上的高效部署面临挑战，现有剪枝技术忽略特征图间的结构依赖，导致剪枝决策不理想。

Method: LinDeps利用主元QR分解检测线性依赖滤波器，并通过信号恢复机制调整下一层内核，无需微调。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet上，LinDeps提高了现有剪枝技术的压缩率并保持性能，在低资源设置中表现优异。

Conclusion: LinDeps是当前和未来剪枝技术的重要补充，显著提升剪枝效果和推理速度。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are widely used in many computer vision
tasks. Yet, their increasing size and complexity pose significant challenges
for efficient deployment on resource-constrained platforms. Hence, network
pruning has emerged as an effective way of reducing the size and computational
requirements of neural networks by removing redundant or unimportant
parameters. However, a fundamental challenge with pruning consists in optimally
removing redundancies without degrading performance. Most existing pruning
techniques overlook structural dependencies across feature maps within a layer,
resulting in suboptimal pruning decisions. In this work, we introduce LinDeps,
a novel post-pruning method, i.e., a pruning method that can be applied on top
of any pruning technique, which systematically identifies and removes redundant
filters via linear dependency analysis. Particularly, LinDeps applies pivoted
QR decomposition to feature maps to detect and prune linearly dependent
filters. Then, a novel signal recovery mechanism adjusts the next layer's
kernels to preserve compatibility and performance without requiring any
fine-tuning. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with VGG and ResNet
backbones demonstrate that LinDeps improves compression rates of existing
pruning techniques while preserving performances, leading to a new state of the
art in CNN pruning. We also benchmark LinDeps in low-resource setups where no
retraining can be performed, which shows significant pruning improvements and
inference speedups over a state-of-the-art method. LinDeps therefore
constitutes an essential add-on for any current or future pruning technique.

*Kejia Zhang,Keda Tao,Zhiming Luo,Chang Liu,Jiasheng Tang,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TARS是一种新型的token自适应偏好策略，通过将DPO重新定义为min-max优化问题，减少多模态语言模型中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DPO策略在处理幻觉问题时依赖静态监督信号，容易过拟合语言线索，损害视觉信息的因果关联。

Method: TARS通过最大化语义约束下的token级分布偏移模拟对齐不确定性，同时最小化偏好损失，保留因果关联。

Result: 在多个幻觉基准测试中，TARS仅用4.8k偏好样本，将幻觉率从26.4%降至13.2%，认知值从2.5降至0.4。

Conclusion: TARS在减少幻觉和提升多模态推理可靠性方面优于标准DPO，部分指标媲美GPT-4o。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable vision-language reasoning,
yet often generate plausible outputs that are factually incorrect or visually
ungrounded, thereby compromising their reliability. Direct preference
optimization (DPO) is a common strategy for correcting hallucinations by
aligning model outputs with human preferences. Existing DPO strategies
typically treat hallucination-related preferences as fixed targets, relying on
static supervision signals during training. This approach tends to overfit to
superficial linguistic cues in preference data, leading to distributional
rigidity and spurious correlations that impair grounding in causally relevant
visual information. To overcome this limitation, we propose TARS, a
token-adaptive preference strategy that reformulates DPO as a min-max
optimization problem. TARS maximizes token-level distributional shifts under
semantic constraints to simulate alignment uncertainty, and simultaneously
minimizes the expected preference loss under these controlled perturbations.
This joint objective preserves causal grounding while mitigating overfitting to
preference patterns, thereby reducing hallucinations in multimodal reasoning.
We evaluate TARS on multiple hallucination benchmarks and find consistently
strong performance. Using only 4.8k preference samples and no expert feedback,
TARS reduces hallucination rates from 26.4% to 13.2% and decreases cognition
value from 2.5 to 0.4. It outperforms standard DPO and matches GPT-4o on
several key metrics.

Result: 总结了WSSS的最新进展，并指出了领域特定数据集的应用挑战。

Conclusion: 讨论了当前挑战、现有方法的局限性，并提出了未来研究的几个有前景方向。

Abstract: Unlike fully supervised semantic segmentation, weakly supervised semantic
segmentation (WSSS) relies on weaker forms of supervision to perform dense
prediction tasks. Among the various types of weak supervision, WSSS with image
level annotations is considered both the most challenging and the most
practical, attracting significant research attention. Therefore, in this
review, we focus on WSSS with image level annotations. Additionally, this
review concentrates on mainstream research directions, deliberately omitting
less influential branches.
  Given the rapid development of new methods and the limitations of existing
surveys in capturing recent trends, there is a pressing need for an updated and
comprehensive review. Our goal is to fill this gap by synthesizing the latest
advancements and state-of-the-art techniques in WSSS with image level labels.
  Basically, we provide a comprehensive review of recent advancements in WSSS
with image level labels, categorizing existing methods based on the types and
levels of additional supervision involved. We also examine the challenges of
applying advanced methods to domain specific datasets in WSSS,a topic that
remains underexplored. Finally, we discuss the current challenges, evaluate the
limitations of existing approaches, and outline several promising directions
for future research. This review is intended for researchers who are already
familiar with the fundamental concepts of WSSS and are seeking to deepen their
understanding of current advances and methodological innovations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于局部老化特征的细粒度人脸老化方法，解决了现有方法将老化视为全局同质过程的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如GAN和扩散模型）通常基于参考图像和目标年龄生成老化效果，忽略了面部区域因内在和外在因素而异的老化过程。

Method: 利用潜在扩散模型选择性老化特定面部区域，并通过潜在扩散细化器无缝融合局部老化区域，实现全局一致的自然合成。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在身份保持、高保真图像和自然可控的老化进程三个方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了更真实和个性化的面部老化，为相关领域提供了新的技术方向。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to face aging that addresses the limitations of
current methods which treat aging as a global, homogeneous process. Existing
techniques using GANs and diffusion models often condition generation on a
reference image and target age, neglecting that facial regions age
heterogeneously due to both intrinsic chronological factors and extrinsic
elements like sun exposure. Our method leverages latent diffusion models to
selectively age specific facial regions using local aging signs. This approach
provides significantly finer-grained control over the generation process,
enabling more realistic and personalized aging. We employ a latent diffusion
refiner to seamlessly blend these locally aged regions, ensuring a globally
consistent and natural-looking synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that
our method effectively achieves three key criteria for successful face aging:
robust identity preservation, high-fidelity and realistic imagery, and a
natural, controllable aging progression.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督跟踪框架SSTrack，无需手动标注框，通过时空一致性训练和实例对比损失实现高效跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跟踪数据集依赖人工标注框，成本高且限制了数据规模和多样性，因此需要一种无需标注的自监督方法。

Method: 采用解耦的时空一致性训练框架，结合全局空间定位和局部时间关联，设计实例对比损失以学习实例级对应关系。

Result: 在九个基准数据集上表现优异，AUC分数在GOT10K、LaSOT和TrackingNet上分别提升25.3%、20.4%和14.8%。

Conclusion: SSTrack通过自监督学习有效减少对标注的依赖，性能超越现有自监督跟踪方法。

Abstract: The success of visual tracking has been largely driven by datasets with
manual box annotations. However, these box annotations require tremendous human
effort, limiting the scale and diversity of existing tracking datasets. In this
work, we present a novel Self-Supervised Tracking framework named
\textbf{{\tracker}}, designed to eliminate the need of box annotations.
Specifically, a decoupled spatio-temporal consistency training framework is
proposed to learn rich target information across timestamps through global
spatial localization and local temporal association. This allows for the
simulation of appearance and motion variations of instances in real-world
scenarios. Furthermore, an instance contrastive loss is designed to learn
instance-level correspondences from a multi-view perspective, offering robust
instance supervision without additional labels. This new design paradigm
enables {\tracker} to effectively learn generic tracking representations in a
self-supervised manner, while reducing reliance on extensive box annotations.
Extensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that {\tracker}
surpasses \textit{SOTA} self-supervised tracking methods, achieving an
improvement of more than 25.3\%, 20.4\%, and 14.8\% in AUC (AO) score on the
GOT10K, LaSOT, TrackingNet datasets, respectively. Code:

Motivation: 探讨在医学图像分割中，复杂模型是否总是优于简单模型，尤其是在低对比度边界任务中。

Method: 使用DeepLabv3模型进行iPS细胞集落分割，并与SAM2和MedSAM2进行比较。

Result: DeepLabv3在实验条件下表现优于SAM2和MedSAM2，无需结构修改。

Conclusion: 在特定任务中，简单模型可能比复杂模型更有效，且开源实现支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation requires not only accuracy but also robustness
under challenging imaging conditions. In this study, we show that a carefully
configured DeepLabv3 model can achieve high performance in segmenting induced
pluripotent stem (iPS) cell colonies, and, under our experimental conditions,
outperforms large-scale foundation models such as SAM2 and its medical variant
MedSAM2 without structural modifications. These results suggest that, for
specialized tasks characterized by subtle, low-contrast boundaries, increased
model complexity does not necessarily translate to better performance. Our work
revisits the assumption that ever-larger and more generalized architectures are
always preferable, and provides evidence that appropriately adapted, simpler
models may offer strong accuracy and practical reliability in domain-specific
biomedical applications. We also offer an open-source implementation that
includes strategies for small datasets and domain-specific encoding, with the
aim of supporting further advances in semantic segmentation for regenerative
medicine and related fields.

Result: 模型在合成和真实图像上表现优异，Pose mAP50-95达0.97。

Conclusion: 合成数据方法有效提升模型性能，适用于复杂场景的风力涡轮机检测。

Abstract: For the autonomous drone-based inspection of wind turbine (WT) blades,
accurate detection of the WT and its key features is essential for safe drone
positioning and collision avoidance. Existing deep learning methods typically
rely on manually labeled real-world images, which limits both the quantity and
the diversity of training datasets in terms of weather conditions, lighting,
turbine types, and image complexity. In this paper, we propose a method to
generate synthetic training data that allows controlled variation of visual and
environmental factors, increasing the diversity and hence creating challenging
learning scenarios. Furthermore, we train a YOLOv11 feature detection network
solely on synthetic WT images with a modified loss function, to detect WTs and
their key features within an image. The resulting network is evaluated both
using synthetic images and a set of real-world WT images and shows promising
performance across both synthetic and real-world data, achieving a Pose
mAP50-95 of 0.97 on real images never seen during training.

Motivation: 工业异常检测对制造系统的安全性和可靠性至关重要，但现有MLLMs在IAD中表现有限，需领域特定适配。

Method: EMIT构建多任务IAD数据集，利用GPT生成文本描述补充缺陷图像缺失；结合软提示和热图引导的对比嵌入；提出难度感知GRPO，包括响应重采样和优势重加权机制。

Result: 在MMAD基准测试中，EMIT显著提升MLLMs的IAD性能，平均提高7.77%。

Conclusion: EMIT通过领域适配和优化策略，有效提升了MLLMs在工业异常检测中的表现。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) plays a crucial role in maintaining the
safety and reliability of manufacturing systems. While multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) show strong vision-language reasoning abilities, their
effectiveness in IAD remains limited without domain-specific adaptation. In
this work, we propose EMIT, a unified framework that enhances MLLMs for IAD via
difficulty-aware group relative policy optimization (GRPO). EMIT constructs a
multi-task IAD dataset and utilizes GPT-generated object text descriptions to
compensate for missing defective images. For few-shot anomaly detection, it
integrates a soft prompt and heatmap-guided contrastive embeddings derived from
patch-level comparisons. To better handle difficult data samples, i.e., cases
where the MLLM struggles to generate correct answers, we propose a
difficulty-aware GRPO that extends the original GRPO by incorporating a
response resampling strategy to ensure the inclusion of correct answers in the
sampled responses, as well as an advantage reweighting mechanism to strengthen
learning from such difficult data samples. Extensive experiments on the MMAD
benchmark demonstrate that EMIT significantly enhances the IAD performance of
MLLMs, achieving an average improvement of 7.77\% over the base model
(InternVL3-8B) across seven tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的多模态修复方法需要架构修改和重新训练，计算成本高；而上下文感知方法缺乏对掩码区域的精细控制。

Method: GuidPaint结合分类器引导和随机/确定性采样，精确控制掩码区域的中间生成。

Result: 实验表明，GuidPaint在定性和定量评估上均优于现有上下文感知修复方法。

Conclusion: GuidPaint通过无需训练的方式实现了高质量的图像修复，同时提供了更好的控制和灵活性。

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models have been widely adopted for image
inpainting tasks due to their powerful generative capabilities, achieving
impressive results. Existing multimodal inpainting methods based on diffusion
models often require architectural modifications and retraining, resulting in
high computational cost. In contrast, context-aware diffusion inpainting
methods leverage the model's inherent priors to adjust intermediate denoising
steps, enabling high-quality inpainting without additional training and
significantly reducing computation. However, these methods lack fine-grained
control over the masked regions, often leading to semantically inconsistent or
visually implausible content. To address this issue, we propose GuidPaint, a
training-free, class-guided image inpainting framework. By incorporating
classifier guidance into the denoising process, GuidPaint enables precise
control over intermediate generations within the masked areas, ensuring both
semantic consistency and visual realism. Furthermore, it integrates stochastic
and deterministic sampling, allowing users to select preferred intermediate
results and deterministically refine them. Experimental results demonstrate
that GuidPaint achieves clear improvements over existing context-aware
inpainting methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

continuous evolution of deep model architectures has driven innovation in VAD
methodologies, significantly enhancing feature representation and scene

LLMs, VAD has undergone significant transformations in terms of data
annotation, input modalities, model architectures, and task objectives. The

current VAD methods based on MLLMs/LLMs. Finally, based on the trajectory of
technological advancements and existing bottlenecks, this paper distills key
challenges and outlines future research directions, offering guidance for the
VAD community.

Abstract: Monitoring benthic biodiversity in Antarctica is vital for understanding
ecological change in response to climate-driven pressures. This work is
typically performed using high-resolution imagery captured in situ, though
manual annotation of such data remains laborious and specialised, impeding
large-scale analysis. We present a tailored object detection framework for
identifying and classifying Antarctic benthic organisms in high-resolution
towed camera imagery, alongside the first public computer vision dataset for
benthic biodiversity monitoring in the Weddell Sea. Our approach addresses key
challenges associated with marine ecological imagery, including limited
annotated data, variable object sizes, and complex seafloor structure. The
proposed framework combines resolution-preserving patching, spatial data
augmentation, fine-tuning, and postprocessing via Slicing Aided Hyper
Inference. We benchmark multiple object detection architectures and demonstrate
strong performance in detecting medium and large organisms across 25
fine-grained morphotypes, significantly more than other works in this area.
Detection of small and rare taxa remains a challenge, reflecting limitations in
current detection architectures. Our framework provides a scalable foundation
for future machine-assisted in situ benthic biodiversity monitoring research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定分辨率的LDMs在高分辨率图像生成中存在局限性，训练方法需要大量数据和计算资源，而基于补丁的方法虽流行但存在分布偏移和单调性问题。

Method: 提出APT框架，结合统计匹配和尺度感知调度，解决补丁级分布偏移和单调性问题，并实现快速采样。

Result: APT生成的高分辨率图像细节更清晰，推理速度更快，质量损失最小。

Conclusion: APT为高分辨率图像生成提供了一种实用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are generally trained at fixed resolutions,
limiting their capability when scaling up to high-resolution images. While
training-based approaches address this limitation by training on
high-resolution datasets, they require large amounts of data and considerable
computational resources, making them less practical. Consequently,
training-free methods, particularly patch-based approaches, have become a
popular alternative. These methods divide an image into patches and fuse the
denoising paths of each patch, showing strong performance on high-resolution
generation. However, we observe two critical issues for patch-based approaches,
which we call ``patch-level distribution shift" and ``increased patch
monotonicity." To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Path Tracing (APT),
a framework that combines Statistical Matching to ensure patch distributions
remain consistent in upsampled latents and Scale-aware Scheduling to deal with
the patch monotonicity. As a result, APT produces clearer and more refined
details in high-resolution images. In addition, APT enables a shortcut
denoising process, resulting in faster sampling with minimal quality
degradation. Our experimental results confirm that APT produces more detailed
outputs with improved inference speed, providing a practical approach to
high-resolution image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像的去标识化（DeID）方法在保护隐私的同时往往牺牲了医学语义，且缺乏对不同隐私级别的灵活调整。

Method: 采用两步框架：1）身份阻断，调整隐私级别；2）医学语义补偿，利用预训练的医学基础模型提取特征。引入特征解耦策略以去除残留身份信息。

Result: 在七个数据集和三个下游任务中，表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架在隐私保护和医学语义保留方面取得了先进性能。

Abstract: Medical imaging has significantly advanced computer-aided diagnosis, yet its
re-identification (ReID) risks raise critical privacy concerns, calling for
de-identification (DeID) techniques. Unfortunately, existing DeID methods
neither particularly preserve medical semantics, nor are flexibly adjustable
towards different privacy levels. To address these issues, we propose a
divide-and-conquer framework comprising two steps: (1) Identity-Blocking, which
blocks varying proportions of identity-related regions, to achieve different
privacy levels; and (2) Medical-Semantics-Compensation, which leverages
pre-trained Medical Foundation Models (MFMs) to extract medical semantic
features to compensate the blocked regions. Moreover, recognizing that features
from MFMs may still contain residual identity information, we introduce a
Minimum Description Length principle-based feature decoupling strategy, to
effectively decouple and discard such identity components. Extensive
evaluations against existing approaches across seven datasets and three

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像因光吸收、散射、海洋生物和碎片导致视觉退化，增强图像对路径检测和自主导航等任务至关重要。

Method: 提出了一种针对水下环境的评估框架，结合实用匹配策略，分析现有方法的优缺点。

Result: 通过度量分析，揭示了现有方法的局限性，并验证了视觉改进对SLAM性能的实际影响。

Conclusion: 该框架为水下图像增强方法提供了实用的评估基准，增强了其在真实场景中的适用性。

Abstract: We introduce local matching stability and furthest matchable frame as
quantitative measures for evaluating the success of underwater image
enhancement. This enhancement process addresses visual degradation caused by
light absorption, scattering, marine growth, and debris. Enhanced imagery plays
a critical role in downstream tasks such as path detection and autonomous
navigation for underwater vehicles, relying on robust feature extraction and
frame matching. To assess the impact of enhancement techniques on
frame-matching performance, we propose a novel evaluation framework tailored to
underwater environments. Through metric-based analysis, we identify strengths
and limitations of existing approaches and pinpoint gaps in their assessment of
real-world applicability. By incorporating a practical matching strategy, our
framework offers a robust, context-aware benchmark for comparing enhancement
methods. Finally, we demonstrate how visual improvements affect the performance
of a complete real-world algorithm -- Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM) -- reinforcing the framework's relevance to operational underwater
scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文通过神经科学启发的消融研究，分析了三种检测Transformer模型（DETR、DDETR、DINO）内部组件的作用，揭示了模型性能与组件的关系，并提出了优化透明度和效率的见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强复杂模型（如检测Transformer）的可解释性和透明度，填补研究空白，明确内部组件的具体作用。

Method: 采用神经科学中的消融研究方法，系统地分析三种检测Transformer模型（DETR、DDETR、DINO）中关键组件（如查询嵌入、MHSA、MHCA）对性能的影响。

Result: 发现模型特定的鲁棒性模式：DETR对编码器MHSA和解码器MHCA敏感，DDETR因多尺度可变形注意力更鲁棒，DINO因知识分布机制最具韧性。同时揭示了结构冗余。

Conclusion: 研究推进了DETR的可解释AI，明确了内部组件对性能的贡献，为优化透明度和效率提供了方向。

Abstract: In recent years, Explainable AI has gained traction as an approach to
enhancing model interpretability and transparency, particularly in complex
models such as detection transformers. Despite rapid advancements, a
substantial research gap remains in understanding the distinct roles of
internal components - knowledge that is essential for improving transparency
and efficiency. Inspired by neuroscientific ablation studies, which investigate
the functions of brain regions through selective impairment, we systematically
analyze the impact of ablating key components in three state-of-the-art
detection transformer models: Detection transformer (DETR), deformable
detection transformer (DDETR), and DETR with improved denoising anchor boxes
(DINO). The ablations target query embeddings, encoder and decoder multi-head
self-attentions (MHSA) as well as decoder multi-head cross-attention (MHCA)
layers. We evaluate the effects of these ablations on the performance metrics
gIoU and F1-score, quantifying effects on both the classification and
regression sub-tasks on the COCO dataset. To facilitate reproducibility and
future research, we publicly release the DeepDissect library. Our findings
reveal model-specific resilience patterns: while DETR is particularly sensitive
to ablations in encoder MHSA and decoder MHCA, DDETR's multi-scale deformable
attention enhances robustness, and DINO exhibits the greatest resilience due to
its look-forward twice update rule, which helps distributing knowledge across
blocks. These insights also expose structural redundancies, particularly in
DDETR's and DINO's decoder MHCA layers, highlighting opportunities for model
simplification without sacrificing performance. This study advances XAI for
DETRs by clarifying the contributions of internal components to model
performance, offering insights to optimize and improve transparency and
efficiency in critical applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAMITE模型基于SAM2改进，通过原型记忆库和位置提示生成器解决VOT中的遮挡和干扰问题，提升跟踪精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VOT方法忽视时间依赖性或泛化性差，且无法有效处理遮挡和干扰。

Method: 结合原型记忆库筛选最佳帧，生成位置提示以减少干扰。

Result: 在六个基准测试中表现优越。

Conclusion: SAMITE显著提升了VOT的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Visual Object Tracking (VOT) is widely used in applications like autonomous
driving to continuously track targets in videos. Existing methods can be
roughly categorized into template matching and autoregressive methods, where
the former usually neglects the temporal dependencies across frames and the
latter tends to get biased towards the object categories during training,
showing weak generalizability to unseen classes. To address these issues, some
methods propose to adapt the video foundation model SAM2 for VOT, where the
tracking results of each frame would be encoded as memory for conditioning the
rest of frames in an autoregressive manner. Nevertheless, existing methods fail
to overcome the challenges of object occlusions and distractions, and do not
have any measures to intercept the propagation of tracking errors. To tackle
them, we present a SAMITE model, built upon SAM2 with additional modules,
including: (1) Prototypical Memory Bank: We propose to quantify the
feature-wise and position-wise correctness of each frame's tracking results,
and select the best frames to condition subsequent frames. As the features of
occluded and distracting objects are feature-wise and position-wise inaccurate,
their scores would naturally be lower and thus can be filtered to intercept
error propagation; (2) Positional Prompt Generator: To further reduce the
impacts of distractors, we propose to generate positional mask prompts to
provide explicit positional clues for the target, leading to more accurate
tracking. Extensive experiments have been conducted on six benchmarks, showing
the superiority of SAMITE. The code is available at
https://github.com/Sam1224/SAMITE.

TL;DR: 提出MAGE框架，通过智能对齐网络（IAN）解决视觉与文本语义空间的对齐问题，提升多模态模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在视觉编码后存在空间和语义损失，导致信息传播中的性能下降。

Result: 在MME、MMBench和SEED等基准测试中表现优于同类工作。

Conclusion: MAGE通过创新对齐机制显著提升多模态模型的性能。

Abstract: In the latest advancements in multimodal learning, effectively addressing the
spatial and semantic losses of visual data after encoding remains a critical
challenge. This is because the performance of large multimodal models is
positively correlated with the coupling between visual encoders and large
language models. Existing approaches often face issues such as vector gaps or
semantic disparities, resulting in information loss during the propagation
process. To address these issues, we propose MAGE (Multimodal Alignment and
Generation Enhancement), a novel framework that bridges the semantic spaces of
vision and text through an innovative alignment mechanism. By introducing the
Intelligent Alignment Network (IAN), MAGE achieves dimensional and semantic
alignment. To reduce the gap between synonymous heterogeneous data, we employ a
training strategy that combines cross-entropy and mean squared error,
significantly enhancing the alignment effect. Moreover, to enhance MAGE's
"Any-to-Any" capability, we developed a fine-tuning dataset for multimodal
tool-calling instructions to expand the model's output capability boundaries.
Finally, our proposed multimodal large model architecture, MAGE, achieved
significantly better performance compared to similar works across various
evaluation benchmarks, including MME, MMBench, and SEED. Complete code and
appendix are available at: https://github.com/GTCOM-NLP/MAGE.

*Shijie Wang,Jian Shi,Haojie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdvRF框架通过对抗性重建反馈学习类别无关的差异表示，提升细粒度图像检索的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有细粒度图像检索方法依赖预定义类别监督，导致检索表示引入类别特定语义，阻碍了对未见类别的泛化。

Method: AdvRF将细粒度图像检索重新定义为视觉差异重建任务，结合检索模型的类别感知差异定位与重建模型的类别无关特征学习。

Result: AdvRF在细粒度和粗粒度数据集上均表现出色。

Conclusion: AdvRF通过对抗性重建反馈有效学习类别无关表示，提升了检索模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Existing fine-grained image retrieval (FGIR) methods predominantly rely on
supervision from predefined categories to learn discriminative representations
for retrieving fine-grained objects. However, they inadvertently introduce
category-specific semantics into the retrieval representation, creating
semantic dependencies on predefined classes that critically hinder
generalization to unseen categories. To tackle this, we propose AdvRF, a novel
adversarial reconstruction feedback framework aimed at learning
category-agnostic discrepancy representations. Specifically, AdvRF reformulates
FGIR as a visual discrepancy reconstruction task via synergizing category-aware
discrepancy localization from retrieval models with category-agnostic feature
learning from reconstruction models. The reconstruction model exposes residual
discrepancies overlooked by the retrieval model, forcing it to improve
localization accuracy, while the refined signals from the retrieval model guide
the reconstruction model to improve its reconstruction ability. Consequently,
the retrieval model localizes visual differences, while the reconstruction
model encodes these differences into category-agnostic representations. This
representation is then transferred to the retrieval model through knowledge
distillation for efficient deployment. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
demonstrate that our AdvRF achieves impressive performance on both widely-used
fine-grained and coarse-grained datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于少量样本的强化学习框架（RLVR），用于卫星图像任务，无需标注数据，仅需少量示例即可显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对遥感等标注数据稀缺的领域，传统大模型难以适用，需要一种高效且成本低的方法。

Method: 采用基于规则奖励的强化学习（RLVR），仅需1个示例即可优化模型，适用于分类、视觉问答等任务。

Result: 实验表明，仅1个示例即可显著提升性能，128个示例可媲美数千标注样本的模型。

Conclusion: RLVR为数据稀缺领域提供了一种高效、低成本的解决方案，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language and vision-language models have enabled
strong reasoning capabilities, yet they remain impractical for specialized
domains like remote sensing, where annotated data is scarce and expensive. We
present the first few-shot reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR)
framework for satellite imagery that eliminates the need for caption
supervision--relying solely on lightweight, rule-based binary or IoU-based
rewards. Adapting the "1-shot RLVR" paradigm from language models to
vision-language models, we employ policy-gradient optimization with as few as
one curated example to align model outputs for satellite reasoning tasks.
Comprehensive experiments across multiple remote sensing benchmarks--including
classification, visual question answering, and grounding--show that even a
single example yields substantial improvements over the base model. Scaling to
128 examples matches or exceeds models trained on thousands of annotated
samples. While the extreme one-shot setting can induce mild, task-specific
overfitting, our approach consistently demonstrates robust generalization and
efficiency across diverse tasks. Further, we find that prompt design and loss
weighting significantly influence training stability and final accuracy. Our
method enables cost-effective and data-efficient development of
domain-specialist vision-language reasoning models, offering a pragmatic recipe
for data-scarce fields: start from a compact VLM, curate a handful of
reward-checkable cases, and train via RLVR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 驾驶员疲劳是交通事故的主要原因，现有深度学习模型计算量大，不适合资源有限的嵌入式设备。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优异，显著降低计算复杂性和延迟。

Conclusion: LiteFat支持实时、资源高效的疲劳检测系统，适用于嵌入式设备。

Abstract: Detecting driver fatigue is critical for road safety, as drowsy driving
remains a leading cause of traffic accidents. Many existing solutions rely on
computationally demanding deep learning models, which result in high latency
and are unsuitable for embedded robotic devices with limited resources (such as
intelligent vehicles/cars) where rapid detection is necessary to prevent
accidents. This paper introduces LiteFat, a lightweight spatio-temporal graph
learning model designed to detect driver fatigue efficiently while maintaining
high accuracy and low computational demands. LiteFat involves converting
streaming video data into spatio-temporal graphs (STG) using facial landmark
detection, which focuses on key motion patterns and reduces unnecessary data
processing. LiteFat uses MobileNet to extract facial features and create a
feature matrix for the STG. A lightweight spatio-temporal graph neural network
is then employed to identify signs of fatigue with minimal processing and low
latency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that LiteFat performs
competitively while significantly decreasing computational complexity and
latency as compared to current state-of-the-art methods. This work enables the
development of real-time, resource-efficient human fatigue detection systems
that can be implemented upon embedded robotic devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准ViT存在参数冗余和计算成本高的问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出MoR-ViT框架，采用动态递归机制，使每个token自适应决定处理深度。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K等基准测试中，参数减少70%，推理加速2.5倍，性能优于现有高效ViT。

Conclusion: 动态递归是高效ViT的有效策略，为实际应用提供了新方向。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in image
recognition, yet standard ViT architectures are hampered by substantial
parameter redundancy and high computational cost, limiting their practical
deployment. While recent efforts on efficient ViTs primarily focus on static
model compression or token-level sparsification, they remain constrained by
fixed computational depth for all tokens. In this work, we present MoR-ViT, a
novel vision transformer framework that, for the first time, incorporates a
token-level dynamic recursion mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Recursions
(MoR) paradigm. This approach enables each token to adaptively determine its
processing depth, yielding a flexible and input-dependent allocation of
computational resources. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K and transfer
benchmarks demonstrate that MoR-ViT not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
with up to 70% parameter reduction and 2.5x inference acceleration, but also
outperforms leading efficient ViT baselines such as DynamicViT and TinyViT
under comparable conditions. These results establish dynamic recursion as an
effective strategy for efficient vision transformers and open new avenues for
scalable and deployable deep learning models in real-world scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情AUs检测是情感计算中的关键挑战，现有方法在数据稀缺和低强度微表情领域表现不足，LLM的潜力尚未被探索。

Method: 提出AU-LLM框架，结合3D-CNN提取视觉特征，通过EFP（多层感知机）融合局部纹理和全局语义特征，生成信息密集的token供LLM推理。

Result: 在CASME II和SAMM数据集上，AU-LLM通过LOSO和跨域协议验证，达到最新最优性能。

Conclusion: AU-LLM展示了LLM在微表情分析中的显著潜力和鲁棒性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The detection of micro-expression Action Units (AUs) is a formidable
challenge in affective computing, pivotal for decoding subtle, involuntary
human emotions. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate profound
reasoning abilities, their application to the fine-grained, low-intensity
domain of micro-expression AU detection remains unexplored. This paper pioneers
this direction by introducing \textbf{AU-LLM}, a novel framework that for the
first time uses LLM to detect AUs in micro-expression datasets with subtle
intensities and the scarcity of data. We specifically address the critical
vision-language semantic gap, the \textbf{Enhanced Fusion Projector (EFP)}. The
EFP employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to intelligently fuse mid-level
(local texture) and high-level (global semantics) visual features from a
specialized 3D-CNN backbone into a single, information-dense token. This
compact representation effectively empowers the LLM to perform nuanced
reasoning over subtle facial muscle movements.Through extensive evaluations on
the benchmark CASME II and SAMM datasets, including stringent
Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) and cross-domain protocols, AU-LLM establishes a
new state-of-the-art, validating the significant potential and robustness of
LLM-based reasoning for micro-expression analysis. The codes are available at

Conclusion: MSGCoOp在少样本泛化和计算效率上表现优异，为视觉语言预训练模型提供了有效改进。

Abstract: Vision-language pre-trained models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization, and prompt learning has emerged as an
efficient alternative to full fine-tuning. However, existing methods often
struggle with generalization to novel classes, a phenomenon attributed to
overfitting on seen classes and forgetting general knowledge. Furthermore,
recent approaches that improve generalization often introduce complex
architectures or heavy computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a
Multiple Semantic-Guided Context Optimization (MSGCoOp) framework to enhance
few-shot generalization while maintaining computational efficiency. Our
approach leverages an ensemble of parallel learnable context vectors to capture
diverse semantic aspects. To enrich these prompts, we introduce a semantic
guidance mechanism that aligns them with comprehensive class descriptions
automatically generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). Furthermore, a
diversity regularization loss encourages the prompts to learn complementary and
orthogonal features, preventing them from collapsing into redundant
representations. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets show that
MSGCoOp significantly improves performance on base-to-novel generalization,
achieving an average harmonic mean improvement of 1.10\% over the strong KgCoOp
baseline. Our method also demonstrates enhanced robustness in cross-domain
generalization tasks. Our code is avaliable at:

Conclusion: 该模型显著提升了医学图像-文本预训练的效果，增强了泛化能力。

Abstract: Medical image-language pre-training aims to align medical images with
clinically relevant text to improve model performance on various downstream
tasks. However, existing models often struggle with the variability and
ambiguity inherent in medical data, limiting their ability to capture nuanced
clinical information and uncertainty. This work introduces an uncertainty-aware
medical image-text pre-training model that enhances generalization capabilities
in medical image analysis. Building on previous methods and focusing on Chest
X-Rays, our approach utilizes structured text reports generated by a large
language model (LLM) to augment image data with clinically relevant context.
These reports begin with a definition of the disease, followed by the
`appearance' section to highlight critical regions of interest, and finally
`observations' and `verdicts' that ground model predictions in clinical
semantics. By modeling both inter- and intra-modal uncertainty, our framework
captures the inherent ambiguity in medical images and text, yielding improved
representations and performance on downstream tasks. Our model demonstrates
significant advances in medical image-text pre-training, obtaining
state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream tasks.

Abstract: Creating immersive and playable 3D worlds from texts or images remains a
fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. Existing world
generation approaches typically fall into two categories: video-based methods
that offer rich diversity but lack 3D consistency and rendering efficiency, and
3D-based methods that provide geometric consistency but struggle with limited
training data and memory-inefficient representations. To address these
limitations, we present HunyuanWorld 1.0, a novel framework that combines the
best of both worlds for generating immersive, explorable, and interactive 3D
scenes from text and image conditions. Our approach features three key
advantages: 1) 360{\deg} immersive experiences via panoramic world proxies; 2)
mesh export capabilities for seamless compatibility with existing computer
graphics pipelines; 3) disentangled object representations for augmented
interactivity. The core of our framework is a semantically layered 3D mesh
representation that leverages panoramic images as 360{\deg} world proxies for
semantic-aware world decomposition and reconstruction, enabling the generation
of diverse 3D worlds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating coherent, explorable, and
interactive 3D worlds while enabling versatile applications in virtual reality,

Conclusion: 论文强调需要开发上下文感知的防御方法，以应对现实中易复现的越狱攻击。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in alignment and content moderation, large
language models (LLMs) and text-to-image (T2I) systems remain vulnerable to
prompt-based attacks known as jailbreaks. Unlike traditional adversarial
examples requiring expert knowledge, many of today's jailbreaks are low-effort,
high-impact crafted by everyday users with nothing more than cleverly worded
prompts. This paper presents a systems-style investigation into how non-experts
reliably circumvent safety mechanisms through techniques such as multi-turn
narrative escalation, lexical camouflage, implication chaining, fictional
impersonation, and subtle semantic edits. We propose a unified taxonomy of
prompt-level jailbreak strategies spanning both text-output and T2I models,
grounded in empirical case studies across popular APIs. Our analysis reveals
that every stage of the moderation pipeline, from input filtering to output
validation, can be bypassed with accessible strategies. We conclude by
highlighting the urgent need for context-aware defenses that reflect the ease
with which these jailbreaks can be reproduced in real-world settings.

Conclusion: 该方法为跨架构蒸馏提供了简单高效的基准。

Abstract: We describe a simple method for cross-architecture knowledge distillation,
where the knowledge transfer is cast into a redundant information suppression
formulation. Existing methods introduce sophisticated modules,
architecture-tailored designs, and excessive parameters, which impair their
efficiency and applicability. We propose to extract the architecture-agnostic
knowledge in heterogeneous representations by reducing the redundant
architecture-exclusive information. To this end, we present a simple redundancy
suppression distillation (RSD) loss, which comprises cross-architecture
invariance maximisation and feature decorrelation objectives. To prevent the
student from entirely losing its architecture-specific capabilities, we further
design a lightweight module that decouples the RSD objective from the student's
internal representations. Our method is devoid of the architecture-specific
designs and complex operations in the pioneering method of OFA. It outperforms
OFA on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k benchmarks with only a fraction of their
parameter overhead, which highlights its potential as a simple and strong
baseline to the cross-architecture distillation community.

Abstract: Applying salient object detection (SOD) to RGB-D videos is an emerging task
called RGB-D VSOD and has recently gained increasing interest, due to
considerable performance gains of incorporating motion and depth and that RGB-D
videos can be easily captured now in daily life. Existing RGB-D VSOD models
have different attempts to derive motion cues, in which extracting motion
information explicitly from optical flow appears to be a more effective and
promising alternative. Despite this, there remains a key issue that how to
effectively utilize optical flow and depth to assist the RGB modality in SOD.
Previous methods always treat optical flow and depth equally with respect to
model designs, without explicitly considering their unequal contributions in
individual scenarios, limiting the potential of motion and depth. To address
this issue and unleash the power of motion and depth, we propose a novel
selective cross-modal fusion framework (SMFNet) for RGB-D VSOD, incorporating a
pixel-level selective fusion strategy (PSF) that achieves optimal fusion of
optical flow and depth based on their actual contributions. Besides, we propose
a multi-dimensional selective attention module (MSAM) to integrate the fused
features derived from PSF with the remaining RGB modality at multiple
dimensions, effectively enhancing feature representation to generate refined
features. We conduct comprehensive evaluation of SMFNet against 19
state-of-the-art models on both RDVS and DVisal datasets, making the evaluation
the most comprehensive RGB-D VSOD benchmark up to date, and it also
demonstrates the superiority of SMFNet over other models. Meanwhile, evaluation
on five video benchmark datasets incorporating synthetic depth validates the
efficacy of SMFNet as well. Our code and benchmark results are made publicly
available at https://github.com/Jia-hao999/SMFNet.

TL;DR: Vid-TTA是一个轻量级的测试时自适应框架，通过自监督辅助任务优化视频编辑，解决时间不一致性和提示过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法存在时间不一致性和提示过拟合问题，且计算资源需求高、高质量标注数据稀缺。

Method: 采用运动感知帧重建机制和提示扰动重建策略，结合元学习动态损失平衡机制。

Result: 显著提升视频时间一致性，减少提示过拟合，计算开销低。

Conclusion: Vid-TTA为现有视频编辑模型提供即插即用的性能提升。

Abstract: Video editing is a critical component of content creation that transforms raw
footage into coherent works aligned with specific visual and narrative
objectives. Existing approaches face two major challenges: temporal
inconsistencies due to failure in capturing complex motion patterns, and
overfitting to simple prompts arising from limitations in UNet backbone
architectures. While learning-based methods can enhance editing quality, they
typically demand substantial computational resources and are constrained by the
scarcity of high-quality annotated data. In this paper, we present Vid-TTA, a
lightweight test-time adaptation framework that personalizes optimization for
each test video during inference through self-supervised auxiliary tasks. Our
approach incorporates a motion-aware frame reconstruction mechanism that
identifies and preserves crucial movement regions, alongside a prompt
perturbation and reconstruction strategy that strengthens model robustness to
diverse textual descriptions. These innovations are orchestrated by a
meta-learning driven dynamic loss balancing mechanism that adaptively adjusts
the optimization process based on video characteristics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Vid-TTA significantly improves video temporal consistency and
mitigates prompt overfitting while maintaining low computational overhead,
offering a plug-and-play performance boost for existing video editing models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在利用视觉线索进行消歧时表现不佳，且单一方向假设（如头部到指尖）可能过于简化，导致性能下降。

Method: 采用双模型框架，分别学习头部到指尖和手腕到指尖的方向；引入高斯射线热图表示和CLIP感知集成模块；增加对象中心预测作为辅助任务。

Result: 在YouRefIt数据集上，0.25 IoU阈值下mAP提升了约4%。

Conclusion: 双模型框架和多模态集成有效提升了指向性参考理解的准确性。

Abstract: We address the problem of Embodied Reference Understanding, which involves
predicting the object that a person in the scene is referring to through both
pointing gesture and language. Accurately identifying the referent requires
multimodal understanding: integrating textual instructions, visual pointing,
and scene context. However, existing methods often struggle to effectively
leverage visual clues for disambiguation. We also observe that, while the
referent is often aligned with the head-to-fingertip line, it occasionally
aligns more closely with the wrist-to-fingertip line. Therefore, relying on a
single line assumption can be overly simplistic and may lead to suboptimal
performance. To address this, we propose a dual-model framework, where one
model learns from the head-to-fingertip direction and the other from the
wrist-to-fingertip direction. We further introduce a Gaussian ray heatmap
representation of these lines and use them as input to provide a strong
supervisory signal that encourages the model to better attend to pointing cues.
To combine the strengths of both models, we present the CLIP-Aware Pointing
Ensemble module, which performs a hybrid ensemble based on CLIP features.
Additionally, we propose an object center prediction head as an auxiliary task
to further enhance referent localization. We validate our approach through
extensive experiments and analysis on the benchmark YouRefIt dataset, achieving
an improvement of approximately 4 mAP at the 0.25 IoU threshold.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服传统文本到视觉流水线的局限性，提供更一致和沉浸式的叙事体验。

Method: 结合Narrator（语言模型生成文本和提示）、Director（动态场景图管理）、Narrative Arc Controller（故事结构控制）和Affective Tone Mapper（情感一致性映射）。

Result: 在多样化的叙事提示上，Aether Weaver在叙事深度、视觉保真度和情感共鸣方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为快速创意原型设计和沉浸式叙事提供了强大平台。

Abstract: We introduce Aether Weaver, a novel, integrated framework for multimodal
narrative co-generation that overcomes limitations of sequential text-to-visual
pipelines. Our system concurrently synthesizes textual narratives, dynamic
scene graph representations, visual scenes, and affective soundscapes, driven
by a tightly integrated, co-generation mechanism. At its core, the Narrator, a
large language model, generates narrative text and multimodal prompts, while
the Director acts as a dynamic scene graph manager, and analyzes the text to
build and maintain a structured representation of the story's world, ensuring
spatio-temporal and relational consistency for visual rendering and subsequent
narrative generation. Additionally, a Narrative Arc Controller guides the
high-level story structure, influencing multimodal affective consistency,
further complemented by an Affective Tone Mapper that ensures congruent
emotional expression across all modalities. Through qualitative evaluations on
a diverse set of narrative prompts encompassing various genres, we demonstrate
that Aether Weaver significantly enhances narrative depth, visual fidelity, and
emotional resonance compared to cascaded baseline approaches. This integrated
framework provides a robust platform for rapid creative prototyping and
immersive storytelling experiences.

Motivation: 现有CLIP模型在多语言数据训练中存在数据筛选困难和性能下降的问题。

Method: 提出MetaCLIP 2方法，通过最小化改动实现英语与非英语数据的互惠训练。

Result: 在零样本ImageNet分类和多语言基准测试中，MetaCLIP 2表现优于现有模型。

Conclusion: MetaCLIP 2为多语言CLIP训练提供了有效解决方案，并取得了新的SOTA性能。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) is a popular foundation model,
supporting from zero-shot classification, retrieval to encoders for multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). Although CLIP is successfully trained on
billion-scale image-text pairs from the English world, scaling CLIP's training
further to learning from the worldwide web data is still challenging: (1) no
curation method is available to handle data points from non-English world; (2)
the English performance from existing multilingual CLIP is worse than its
English-only counterpart, i.e., "curse of multilinguality" that is common in
LLMs. Here, we present MetaCLIP 2, the first recipe training CLIP from scratch
on worldwide web-scale image-text pairs. To generalize our findings, we conduct
rigorous ablations with minimal changes that are necessary to address the above
challenges and present a recipe enabling mutual benefits from English and
non-English world data. In zero-shot ImageNet classification, MetaCLIP 2
ViT-H/14 surpasses its English-only counterpart by 0.8% and mSigLIP by 0.7%,
and surprisingly sets new state-of-the-art without system-level confounding
factors (e.g., translation, bespoke architecture changes) on multilingual
benchmarks, such as CVQA with 57.4%, Babel-ImageNet with 50.2% and XM3600 with
64.3% on image-to-text retrieval.

Abstract: Deepfakes powered by advanced machine learning models present a significant
and evolving threat to identity verification and the authenticity of digital
media. Although numerous detectors have been developed to address this problem,
their effectiveness has yet to be tested when applied to real-world data. In
this work we evaluate modern deepfake detectors, introducing a novel testing
procedure designed to mimic real-world scenarios for deepfake detection. Using
state-of-the-art deepfake generation methods, we create a comprehensive dataset
containing more than 500,000 high-quality deepfake images. Our analysis shows
that detecting deepfakes still remains a challenging task. The evaluation shows
that in fewer than half of the deepfake detectors tested achieved an AUC score
greater than 60%, with the lowest being 50%. We demonstrate that basic image
manipulations, such as JPEG compression or image enhancement, can significantly
reduce model performance. All code and data are publicly available at

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated success in computational
pathology (CPath) for disease detection, biomarker classification, and
prognosis prediction. However, its potential to learn unintended demographic
biases, particularly those related to social determinants of health, remains
understudied. This study investigates whether deep learning models can predict
self-reported race from digitized dermatopathology slides and identifies
potential morphological shortcuts. Using a multisite dataset with a racially
diverse population, we apply an attention-based mechanism to uncover
race-associated morphological features. After evaluating three dataset curation
strategies to control for confounding factors, the final experiment showed that
White and Black demographic groups retained high prediction performance (AUC:
0.799, 0.762), while overall performance dropped to 0.663. Attention analysis
revealed the epidermis as a key predictive feature, with significant
performance declines when these regions were removed. These findings highlight
the need for careful data curation and bias mitigation to ensure equitable AI
deployment in pathology. Code available at:

Abstract: Analyzing digitized artworks presents unique challenges, requiring not only
visual interpretation but also a deep understanding of rich artistic,
contextual, and historical knowledge. We introduce ArtSeek, a multimodal
framework for art analysis that combines multimodal large language models with
retrieval-augmented generation. Unlike prior work, our pipeline relies only on
image input, enabling applicability to artworks without links to Wikidata or
Wikipedia-common in most digitized collections. ArtSeek integrates three key
components: an intelligent multimodal retrieval module based on late
interaction retrieval, a contrastive multitask classification network for
predicting artist, genre, style, media, and tags, and an agentic reasoning
strategy enabled through in-context examples for complex visual question
answering and artwork explanation via Qwen2.5-VL. Central to this approach is
WikiFragments, a Wikipedia-scale dataset of image-text fragments curated to
support knowledge-grounded multimodal reasoning. Our framework achieves
state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, including a +8.4% F1
improvement in style classification over GraphCLIP and a +7.1 BLEU@1 gain in
captioning on ArtPedia. Qualitative analyses show that ArtSeek can interpret
visual motifs, infer historical context, and retrieve relevant knowledge, even
for obscure works. Though focused on visual arts, our approach generalizes to
other domains requiring external knowledge, supporting scalable multimodal AI
research. Both the dataset and the source code will be made publicly available

Motivation: 眼底图像分析面临小病灶区域和疾病间差异细微的挑战，导致模型预测准确性下降和过拟合。

Method: 提出SwinECAT模型，结合Swin Attention和ECA Attention机制，以捕捉局部空间结构和长程依赖关系，并优化特征通道注意力。

Result: 在包含16,140张眼底图像的EDID数据集上，SwinECAT实现了88.29%的准确率，加权F1分数0.88，宏观F1分数0.90，显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: SwinECAT在9类别眼底疾病分类中表现出色，是目前公开数据集上的最高性能。

Abstract: In recent years, artificial intelligence has been increasingly applied in the
field of medical imaging. Among these applications, fundus image analysis
presents special challenges, including small lesion areas in certain fundus
diseases and subtle inter-disease differences, which can lead to reduced
prediction accuracy and overfitting in the models. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes the Transformer-based model SwinECAT, which combines the
Shifted Window (Swin) Attention with the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA)
Attention. SwinECAT leverages the Swin Attention mechanism in the Swin
Transformer backbone to effectively capture local spatial structures and
long-range dependencies within fundus images. The lightweight ECA mechanism is
incorporated to guide the SwinECAT's attention toward critical feature
channels, enabling more discriminative feature representation. In contrast to
previous studies that typically classify fundus images into 4 to 6 categories,
this work expands fundus disease classification to 9 distinct types, thereby
enhancing the granularity of diagnosis. We evaluate our method on the Eye
Disease Image Dataset (EDID) containing 16,140 fundus images for 9-category
classification. Experimental results demonstrate that SwinECAT achieves 88.29\%
accuracy, with weighted F1-score of 0.88 and macro F1-score of 0.90. The
classification results of our proposed model SwinECAT significantly outperform
the baseline Swin Transformer and multiple compared baseline models. To our
knowledge, this represents the highest reported performance for 9-category
classification on this public dataset.

TL;DR: MMAT-1M是一个百万规模的多模态代理调优数据集，旨在提升多模态大语言模型在思维链、反思和动态工具使用方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态领域缺乏大规模高质量的代理调优数据集，限制了多模态大语言模型的潜力。

Method: 通过四阶段数据引擎构建数据集：1）收集公开多模态数据集；2）用GPT-4o生成理性并整合API调用和RAG信息；3）通过反思优化理性；4）可选压缩为单轮格式。

Result: InternVL2.5-8B-RR模型在多个基准测试中表现显著提升，平均提高2.7%，在Dyn-VQA上提升8.8%。

Conclusion: MMAT-1M有效提升了多模态推理和工具使用能力，数据集已公开。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), enhanced through agent tuning, have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and tool
utilization, significantly surpassing the performance of standalone models.
However, the multimodal domain still lacks a large-scale, high-quality agent
tuning dataset to unlock the full potential of multimodal large language
models. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMAT-1M, the first million-scale
multimodal agent tuning dataset designed to support CoT, reflection, and
dynamic tool usage. Our dataset is constructed through a novel four-stage data
engine: 1) We first curate publicly available multimodal datasets containing
question-answer pairs; 2) Then, leveraging GPT-4o, we generate rationales for
the original question-answer pairs and dynamically integrate API calls and
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) information through a multi-turn paradigm;
3) Furthermore, we refine the rationales through reflection to ensure logical
consistency and accuracy, creating a multi-turn dialogue dataset with both
Rationale and Reflection (RR); 4) Finally, to enhance efficiency, we optionally
compress multi-turn dialogues into a One-turn Rationale and Reflection (ORR)
format. By fine-tuning open-source multimodal models on the MMAT-1M, we observe
significant performance gains. For instance, the InternVL2.5-8B-RR model
achieves an average improvement of 2.7% across eight public benchmarks and 8.8%
on the RAG benchmark Dyn-VQA, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness in
enhancing multimodal reasoning and tool-based capabilities. The dataset is

Result: 在RG和Fis-V数据集上，LMAC-Net显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LMAC-Net通过多模态对齐和特征增强，有效解决了长期动作质量评估的挑战。

Abstract: Long-term action quality assessment (AQA) focuses on evaluating the quality
of human activities in videos lasting up to several minutes. This task plays an
important role in the automated evaluation of artistic sports such as rhythmic
gymnastics and figure skating, where both accurate motion execution and
temporal synchronization with background music are essential for performance
assessment. However, existing methods predominantly fall into two categories:
unimodal approaches that rely solely on visual features, which are inadequate
for modeling multimodal cues like music; and multimodal approaches that
typically employ simple feature-level contrastive fusion, overlooking deep
cross-modal collaboration and temporal dynamics. As a result, they struggle to
capture complex interactions between modalities and fail to accurately track
critical performance changes throughout extended sequences. To address these
challenges, we propose the Long-term Multimodal Attention Consistency Network
(LMAC-Net). LMAC-Net introduces a multimodal attention consistency mechanism to
explicitly align multimodal features, enabling stable integration of visual and
audio information and enhancing feature representations. Specifically, we
introduce a multimodal local query encoder module to capture temporal semantics
and cross-modal relations, and use a two-level score evaluation for
interpretable results. In addition, attention-based and regression-based losses
are applied to jointly optimize multimodal alignment and score fusion.
Experiments conducted on the RG and Fis-V datasets demonstrate that LMAC-Net
significantly outperforms existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our
proposed approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后训练量化（PTQ）在有限校准数据下表现不佳，尤其是隐私约束下。数据无关量化（DFQ）通过生成合成图像缓解此问题，但现有方法未充分探索合成图像与量化模型泛化能力的关系。

Method: 提出mixup-class prompt策略，融合多类别标签生成多样且鲁棒的合成数据，通过梯度范数和泛化误差分析提供定量见解。

Result: 在CNN和ViT上实验表明，该方法优于现有DFQ方法（如GenQ），并在极低位量化（W2A4）中达到新SOTA准确率。

Conclusion: mixup-class prompt显著提升PTQ的泛化能力和优化稳定性，为极低位量化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) improves efficiency but struggles with
limited calibration data, especially under privacy constraints. Data-free
quantization (DFQ) mitigates this by generating synthetic images using
generative models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and
text-conditioned latent diffusion models (LDMs), while applying existing PTQ
algorithms. However, the relationship between generated synthetic images and
the generalizability of the quantized model during PTQ remains underexplored.
Without investigating this relationship, synthetic images generated by previous
prompt engineering methods based on single-class prompts suffer from issues
such as polysemy, leading to performance degradation. We propose
\textbf{mixup-class prompt}, a mixup-based text prompting strategy that fuses
multiple class labels at the text prompt level to generate diverse, robust
synthetic data. This approach enhances generalization, and improves
optimization stability in PTQ. We provide quantitative insights through
gradient norm and generalization error analysis. Experiments on convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) show that our method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art DFQ methods like GenQ. Furthermore,
it pushes the performance boundary in extremely low-bit scenarios, achieving
new state-of-the-art accuracy in challenging 2-bit weight, 4-bit activation

Motivation: 现有方法依赖阴影掩码，但在真实场景中难以获取；利用局部对比信息等内在图像线索存在模糊性问题。

Result: 在无掩码方法中达到最优，与基于掩码的方法性能相当。

Conclusion: AGBA和FCFN有效解决了阴影去除中的模糊性和细节恢复问题。

Abstract: Existing shadow removal methods often rely on shadow masks, which are
challenging to acquire in real-world scenarios. Exploring intrinsic image cues,
such as local contrast information, presents a potential alternative for
guiding shadow removal in the absence of explicit masks. However, the cue's
inherent ambiguity becomes a critical limitation in complex scenes, where it
can fail to distinguish true shadows from low-reflectance objects and intricate
background textures. To address this motivation, we propose the Adaptive Gated
Dual-Branch Attention (AGBA) mechanism. AGBA dynamically filters and re-weighs
the contrast prior to effectively disentangle shadow features from confounding
visual elements. Furthermore, to tackle the persistent challenge of restoring
soft shadow boundaries and fine-grained details, we introduce a diffusion-based
Frequency-Contrast Fusion Network (FCFN) that leverages high-frequency and
contrast cues to guide the generative process. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results among mask-free
approaches while maintaining competitive performance relative to mask-based
methods.

Result: 提出的框架直接针对共现问题，无需外部监督，改善了伪掩码的覆盖率和准确性。

Conclusion: 新框架有效解决了弱监督语义分割中的共现问题，提升了在工业烟雾等领域的适用性。

Abstract: Scarcity of pixel-level labels is a significant challenge in practical
scenarios. In specific domains like industrial smoke, acquiring such detailed
annotations is particularly difficult and often requires expert knowledge. To
alleviate this, weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has emerged as a
promising approach. However, due to the supervision gap and inherent bias in
models trained with only image level labels, existing WSSS methods suffer from
limitations such as incomplete foreground coverage, inaccurate object
boundaries, and spurious correlations, especially in our domain, where
emissions are always spatially coupled with chimneys.
  Previous solutions typically rely on additional priors or external knowledge
to mitigate these issues, but they often lack scalability and fail to address
the model's inherent bias toward co-occurring context. To address this, we
propose a novel WSSS framework that directly targets the co-occurrence problem
without relying on external supervision. Unlike prior methods that adopt a
single network, we employ a teacher-student framework that combines CNNs and
ViTs. We introduce a knowledge transfer loss that enforces cross-architecture
consistency by aligning internal representations. Additionally, we incorporate
post-processing techniques to address partial coverage and further improve
pseudo mask quality.

Abstract: Wide-baseline panorama reconstruction has emerged as a highly effective and
pivotal approach for not only achieving geometric reconstruction of the
surrounding 3D environment, but also generating highly realistic and immersive
novel views. Although existing methods have shown remarkable performance across
various benchmarks, they are predominantly reliant on accurate pose
information. In real-world scenarios, the acquisition of precise pose often
requires additional computational resources and is highly susceptible to noise.
These limitations hinder the broad applicability and practicality of such
methods. In this paper, we present PanoSplatt3R, an unposed wide-baseline
panorama reconstruction method. We extend and adapt the foundational
reconstruction pretrainings from the perspective domain to the panoramic
domain, thus enabling powerful generalization capabilities. To ensure a
seamless and efficient domain-transfer process, we introduce RoPE rolling that
spans rolled coordinates in rotary positional embeddings across different
attention heads, maintaining a minimal modification to RoPE's mechanism, while
modeling the horizontal periodicity of panorama images. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that PanoSplatt3R, even in the absence of pose
information, significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. This
superiority is evident in both the generation of high-quality novel views and
the accuracy of depth estimation, thereby showcasing its great potential for
practical applications. Project page: https://npucvr.github.io/PanoSplatt3R

*Xiaoyu Wang,Ramesh Nadarajah,Zhiqiang Zhang,David Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种深度学习框架，专门用于将心电图图像分类为五种主要诊断类别，解决了图像噪声和波形细节检测的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心血管疾病是全球主要死因，早期检测至关重要。心电图（ECG）是关键工具，但人工解读耗时且需专业知识。现有研究多关注数字信号，而临床中ECG多为图像形式。

Method: 采用预处理管道减少视觉噪声，并使用两阶段微调策略：先在合成和外部ECG图像数据集上微调学习领域特征，再在目标数据集上微调增强疾病识别能力。模型基于ConvNeXt架构。

Result: 在公开验证集和私有测试集上的AUROC分数分别为0.9688和0.9677，表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法在自动ECG解读中具有实用潜力，可提升临床工作效率。

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading global cause of death, and
early detection is essential to improve patient outcomes. Electrocardiograms
(ECGs), especially 12-lead ECGs, play a key role in the identification of CVDs.
These are routinely interpreted by human experts, a process that is
time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. Historical research in this area
has focused on automatic ECG interpretation from digital signals, with recent
deep learning approaches achieving strong results. In practice, however, most
ECG data in clinical practice are stored or shared in image form. To bridge
this gap, we propose a deep learning framework designed specifically to
classify paper-like ECG images into five main diagnostic categories. Our method
was the winning entry to the 2024 British Heart Foundation Open Data Science
Challenge. It addresses two main challenges of paper ECG classification: visual
noise (e.g., shadows or creases) and the need to detect fine-detailed waveform
patterns. We propose a pre-processing pipeline that reduces visual noise and a
two-stage fine-tuning strategy: the model is first fine-tuned on synthetic and
external ECG image datasets to learn domain-specific features, and then further
fine-tuned on the target dataset to enhance disease-specific recognition. We
adopt the ConvNeXt architecture as the backbone of our model. Our method
achieved AUROC scores of 0.9688 on the public validation set and 0.9677 on the
private test set of the British Heart Foundation Open Data Science Challenge,
highlighting its potential as a practical tool for automated ECG interpretation
in clinical workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用事件相机的高动态范围和精细时间分辨率实现鲁棒的场景理解，但面临稀疏噪声事件流和图像数据融合的挑战。

Method: 提出EIFNet，包含自适应事件特征优化模块（AEFRM）、模态自适应重校准模块（MARM）和多头注意力门控融合模块（MGFM），通过多尺度建模和注意力机制优化特征融合。

Result: 在DDD17-Semantic和DSEC-Semantic数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: EIFNet有效解决了事件相机语义分割中的关键问题，展现了多模态融合的优势。

Abstract: Event-based semantic segmentation explores the potential of event cameras,
which offer high dynamic range and fine temporal resolution, to achieve robust
scene understanding in challenging environments. Despite these advantages, the
task remains difficult due to two main challenges: extracting reliable features
from sparse and noisy event streams, and effectively fusing them with dense,
semantically rich image data that differ in structure and representation. To
address these issues, we propose EIFNet, a multi-modal fusion network that
combines the strengths of both event and frame-based inputs. The network
includes an Adaptive Event Feature Refinement Module (AEFRM), which improves
event representations through multi-scale activity modeling and spatial
attention. In addition, we introduce a Modality-Adaptive Recalibration Module
(MARM) and a Multi-Head Attention Gated Fusion Module (MGFM), which align and
integrate features across modalities using attention mechanisms and gated
fusion strategies. Experiments on DDD17-Semantic and DSEC-Semantic datasets
show that EIFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its
effectiveness in event-based semantic segmentation.

Motivation: 现有微动作识别方法往往忽略微动作中固有的细微变化，导致识别精度受限。

Method: 设计了运动引导骨骼调制模块（MSM）和运动引导时间调制模块（MTM），分别从骨骼和帧级别注入运动线索，并结合多尺度特征的运动一致性学习策略。

Result: 在Micro-Action 52和iMiGUE数据集上，MMN实现了基于骨架的微动作识别的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明，显式建模细微运动线索对微动作识别至关重要，MMN为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Micro-Actions (MAs) are an important form of non-verbal communication in
social interactions, with potential applications in human emotional analysis.
However, existing methods in Micro-Action Recognition often overlook the
inherent subtle changes in MAs, which limits the accuracy of distinguishing MAs
with subtle changes. To address this issue, we present a novel Motion-guided
Modulation Network (MMN) that implicitly captures and modulates subtle motion
cues to enhance spatial-temporal representation learning. Specifically, we
introduce a Motion-guided Skeletal Modulation module (MSM) to inject motion
cues at the skeletal level, acting as a control signal to guide spatial
representation modeling. In parallel, we design a Motion-guided Temporal
Modulation module (MTM) to incorporate motion information at the frame level,
facilitating the modeling of holistic motion patterns in micro-actions.
Finally, we propose a motion consistency learning strategy to aggregate the
motion cues from multi-scale features for micro-action classification.
Experimental results on the Micro-Action 52 and iMiGUE datasets demonstrate
that MMN achieves state-of-the-art performance in skeleton-based micro-action
recognition, underscoring the importance of explicitly modeling subtle motion
cues. The code will be available at https://github.com/momiji-bit/MMN.

Result: ZIUM在多种未学习场景中表现优异，攻击成功率高且时间成本显著降低。

Conclusion: ZIUM为对抗攻击提供了高效、灵活的解决方案，显著提升了攻击效果和效率。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) removes specific data points or concepts from deep
learning models to enhance privacy and prevent sensitive content generation.
Adversarial prompts can exploit unlearned models to generate content containing
removed concepts, posing a significant security risk. However, existing
adversarial attack methods still face challenges in generating content that
aligns with an attacker's intent while incurring high computational costs to
identify successful prompts. To address these challenges, we propose ZIUM, a
Zero-shot Intent-aware adversarial attack on Unlearned Models, which enables
the flexible customization of target attack images to reflect an attacker's
intent. Additionally, ZIUM supports zero-shot adversarial attacks without
requiring further optimization for previously attacked unlearned concepts. The
evaluation across various MU scenarios demonstrated ZIUM's effectiveness in
successfully customizing content based on user-intent prompts while achieving a
superior attack success rate compared to existing methods. Moreover, its
zero-shot adversarial attack significantly reduces the attack time for
previously attacked unlearned concepts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出无需微调或重新训练即可对预训练模型进行染色和锁定的新方法，保护模型知识产权。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保护计算机视觉模型的知识产权，防止未经授权使用。

Method: 通过直接修改少量模型权重实现染色（水印）和锁定，锁定模型需在输入图像中插入触发补丁解锁。

Result: 实验证明方法有效，对模型性能影响小，并提供了可计算的最坏情况误报率保证。

Conclusion: 新方法为预训练模型提供了高效的知识产权保护方案。

Abstract: We introduce new methods of staining and locking computer vision models, to
protect their owners' intellectual property. Staining, also known as
watermarking, embeds secret behaviour into a model which can later be used to
identify it, while locking aims to make a model unusable unless a secret
trigger is inserted into input images. Unlike existing methods, our algorithms
can be used to stain and lock pre-trained models without requiring fine-tuning
or retraining, and come with provable, computable guarantees bounding their
worst-case false positive rates. The stain and lock are implemented by directly
modifying a small number of the model's weights and have minimal impact on the
(unlocked) model's performance. Locked models are unlocked by inserting a small
`trigger patch' into the corner of the input image. We present experimental
results showing the efficacy of our methods and demonstrating their practical
performance on a variety of computer vision models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决工业烟雾分割中像素级标注成本高和数据稀缺的问题。

Method: 利用公民提供的视频级标签和对抗特征对齐，生成伪标签并通过公民投票优化。

Result: 在SMOKE5K和IJmond数据集上，F1分数和IoU显著提升，接近全监督模型性能。

Conclusion: 结合公民科学和弱监督域适应，为数据稀缺的环境监测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Industrial smoke segmentation is critical for air-quality monitoring and
environmental protection but is often hampered by the high cost and scarcity of
pixel-level annotations in real-world settings. We introduce CEDANet, a
human-in-the-loop, class-aware domain adaptation framework that uniquely
integrates weak, citizen-provided video-level labels with adversarial feature
alignment. Specifically, we refine pseudo-labels generated by a source-trained
segmentation model using citizen votes, and employ class-specific domain
discriminators to transfer rich source-domain representations to the industrial
domain. Comprehensive experiments on SMOKE5K and custom IJmond datasets
demonstrate that CEDANet achieves an F1-score of 0.414 and a smoke-class IoU of
0.261 with citizen feedback, vastly outperforming the baseline model, which
scored 0.083 and 0.043 respectively. This represents a five-fold increase in
F1-score and a six-fold increase in smoke-class IoU. Notably, CEDANet with
citizen-constrained pseudo-labels achieves performance comparable to the same
architecture trained on limited 100 fully annotated images with F1-score of
0.418 and IoU of 0.264, demonstrating its ability to reach small-sampled fully
supervised-level accuracy without target-domain annotations. Our research
validates the scalability and cost-efficiency of combining citizen science with
weakly supervised domain adaptation, offering a practical solution for complex,
data-scarce environmental monitoring applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs在视觉理解和多模态推理方面表现出色，但常出现幻觉现象，即生成的文本与视觉内容不一致。现有方法多为文本中心，视觉语义对齐的挑战限制了其效果。

Method: ViHallu通过生成视觉变化图像（保持整体结构但可控变化）和构建视觉指令，增强LVLMs对细粒度视觉内容的理解，从而改善视觉语义对齐。

Result: 在多基准测试中，ViHallu显著提升了模型的细粒度视觉理解能力并减少了幻觉倾向。同时发布了ViHallu-Instruction数据集。

Conclusion: ViHallu通过视觉中心的方法有效缓解了LVLMs的幻觉问题，提升了视觉语义对齐能力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in visual understanding and multimodal reasoning. However, LVLMs
frequently exhibit hallucination phenomena, manifesting as the generated
textual responses that demonstrate inconsistencies with the provided visual
content. Existing hallucination mitigation methods are predominantly
text-centric, the challenges of visual-semantic alignment significantly limit
their effectiveness, especially when confronted with fine-grained visual
understanding scenarios. To this end, this paper presents ViHallu, a
Vision-Centric Hallucination mitigation framework that enhances visual-semantic
alignment through Visual Variation Image Generation and Visual Instruction
Construction. ViHallu introduces \textbf{\textit{visual variation images}} with
controllable visual alterations while maintaining the overall image structure.
These images, combined with carefully constructed visual instructions, enable
LVLMs to better understand fine-grained visual content through fine-tuning,
allowing models to more precisely capture the correspondence between visual
content and text, thereby enhancing visual-semantic alignment. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks show that ViHallu effectively enhances
models' fine-grained visual understanding while significantly reducing
hallucination tendencies. Furthermore, we release ViHallu-Instruction, a visual
instruction dataset specifically designed for hallucination mitigation and
visual-semantic alignment. Code is available at

Motivation: 验证密集音频-视觉模型在低资源、多语言和嘈杂环境中的有效性，特别是在发展中国家常见的多语言混合场景。

Method: 比较三种对比目标函数：全局均值池化（CLIP风格）、密集最大均值令牌匹配（DenseAV风格）和一种简单混合方法。

Result: 密集目标函数在音频-视觉检索中相对R@1提升59%，并显著降低平均/中位数排名，同时保持视觉主干冻结。

Conclusion: 密集令牌路由在低资源环境中更为关键，且无需高资源英语语料库支持，适用于多语言和嘈杂场景。

Abstract: Recent dense audio-visual (AV) models achieve impressive retrieval and
emergent localization, but almost all evidence comes from English-centric,
caption-rich web video. It is unclear whether these objectives survive in
low-resource, code-switched, and noisy multilingual settings that typify
developing regions. We show they do**-**and that the choice of aggregation
function becomes even more critical. Using a multilingual subset of Project
Vaani spanning dozens of Indian languages and dialectal variants, we compare
three contrastive objectives: (i) a global mean-pooled loss (CLIP-style), (ii)
a dense max-mean token matcher (DenseAV-style), and (iii) a simple hybrid
(motivated by frozen-vision alignment strategies). The dense objective delivers
a +59% relative R@1 (Audio Visual) improvement over global pooling and
substantially lower mean/median ranks, while consistently producing sharp
zero-shot localization heatmaps of spoken objects-despite keeping the vision
backbone entirely frozen (no LoRA / partial fine-tuning). Our results
demonstrate that dense token routing is not a luxury of high-resource English
corpora; it is more decisive when annotations and acoustic cleanliness are
scarce. We release the codebase and trained models.

Abstract: We propose a novel segmentation-based explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) method for neural networks working on point cloud classification. As one
building block of this method, we propose a novel point-shifting mechanism to
introduce perturbations in point cloud data. Recently, AI has seen an
exponential growth. Hence, it is important to understand the decision-making
process of AI algorithms when they are applied in critical areas. Our work
focuses on explaining AI algorithms that classify point cloud data. An
important aspect of the methods used for explaining AI algorithms is their
ability to produce explanations that are easy for humans to understand. This
allows them to analyze the AI algorithms better and make appropriate decisions
based on that analysis. Therefore, in this work, we intend to generate
meaningful explanations that can be easily interpreted by humans. The point
cloud data we consider represents 3D objects such as cars, guitars, and
laptops. We make use of point cloud segmentation models to generate
explanations for the working of classification models. The segments are used to
introduce perturbations into the input point cloud data and generate saliency
maps. The perturbations are introduced using the novel point-shifting mechanism
proposed in this work which ensures that the shifted points no longer influence
the output of the classification algorithm. In contrast to previous methods,
the segments used by our method are meaningful, i.e. humans can easily
interpret the meaning of the segments. Thus, the benefit of our method over
other methods is its ability to produce more meaningful saliency maps. We
compare our method with the use of classical clustering algorithms to generate
explanations. We also analyze the saliency maps generated for example inputs
using our method to demonstrate the usefulness of the method in generating
meaningful explanations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有导航基础模型仅依赖离线数据，缺乏对动作后果的推理和适应能力，难以满足真实世界中交互和安全需求。

Method: S2E框架结合视频预训练和强化学习，引入Anchor-Guided Distribution Matching策略和Residual-Attention模块。

Result: 实验表明S2E解决了离线数据扩展的收益递减问题，强化学习在机器人学习中优于监督微调。

Conclusion: 交互式在线经验对扩展机器人基础模型至关重要。

Abstract: Navigation foundation models trained on massive webscale data enable agents
to generalize across diverse environments and embodiments. However, these
models trained solely on offline data, often lack the capacity to reason about
the consequences of their actions or adapt through counterfactual
understanding. They thus face significant limitations in the real-world urban
navigation where interactive and safe behaviors, such as avoiding obstacles and
moving pedestrians, are critical. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the
Seeing-to-Experiencing framework to scale the capability of navigation
foundation models with reinforcement learning. S2E combines the strengths of
pre-training on videos and post-training through RL. It maintains the
generalizability acquired from large-scale real-world videos while enhancing
its interactivity through RL in simulation environments. Specifically, we
introduce two innovations: an Anchor-Guided Distribution Matching strategy,
which stabilizes learning and models diverse motion patterns through
anchor-based supervision; and a Residual-Attention Module, which obtains
reactive behaviors from simulation environments without erasing the model's
pretrained knowledge. Moreover, we establish a comprehensive end-to-end
evaluation benchmark, NavBench-GS, built on photorealistic 3DGS reconstructions
of real-world scenes that incorporate physical interactions. It can
systematically assess the generalizability and safety of navigation foundation
models. Extensive experiments show that S2E mitigates the diminishing returns
often seen when scaling with offline data alone. We perform a thorough analysis
of the benefits of Reinforcement Learning compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning in
the context of post-training for robot learning. Our findings emphasize the
crucial role of integrating interactive online experiences to effectively scale
foundation models in Robotics.

Result: 在三个细粒度少样本基准测试中，LCN-4显著优于基于ConvNet-4的现有方法，性能与多数基于ResNet12的方法相当或更优。

Conclusion: 浅层网络通过适当设计可以实现与深度网络相当的性能，为FGFSL提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning has witnessed the extensive utilization across a wide spectrum
of domains, including fine-grained few-shot learning (FGFSL) which heavily
depends on deep backbones. Nonetheless, shallower deep backbones such as
ConvNet-4, are not commonly preferred because they're prone to extract a larger
quantity of non-abstract visual attributes. In this paper, we initially
re-evaluate the relationship between network depth and the ability to fully
encode few-shot instances, and delve into whether shallow deep architecture
could effectuate comparable or superior performance to mainstream deep
backbone. Fueled by the inspiration from vanilla ConvNet-4, we introduce a
location-aware constellation network (LCN-4), equipped with a cutting-edge
location-aware feature clustering module. This module can proficiently encoder
and integrate spatial feature fusion, feature clustering, and recessive feature
location, thereby significantly minimizing the overall loss. Specifically, we
innovatively put forward a general grid position encoding compensation to
effectively address the issue of positional information missing during the
feature extraction process of specific ordinary convolutions. Additionally, we
further propose a general frequency domain location embedding technique to
offset for the location loss in clustering features. We have carried out
validation procedures on three representative fine-grained few-shot benchmarks.
Relevant experiments have established that LCN-4 notably outperforms the
ConvNet-4 based State-of-the-Arts and achieves performance that is on par with
or superior to most ResNet12-based methods, confirming the correctness of our
conjecture.

object-level semantics; and 2D-3D OVS, a 2D-3D open-vocabulary semantic module
that lifts 2D features into 3D by learning fused descriptors integrating

CLIP semantics directly into the reconstruction process, enabling globally

Abstract: Difficult few-shot image recognition has significant application prospects,
yet remaining the substantial technical gaps with the conventional large-scale
image recognition. In this paper, we have proposed an efficient original method
for few-shot image recognition, called CIELab-Guided Coherent Meta-Learning
(MetaLab). Structurally, our MetaLab comprises two collaborative neural
networks: LabNet, which can perform domain transformation for the CIELab color
space and extract rich grouped features, and coherent LabGNN, which can
facilitate mutual learning between lightness graph and color graph. For
sufficient certification, we have implemented extensive comparative studies on
four coarse-grained benchmarks, four fine-grained benchmarks, and four
cross-domain few-shot benchmarks. Specifically, our method can achieve high
accuracy, robust performance, and effective generalization capability with
one-shot sample per class. Overall, all experiments have demonstrated that our
MetaLab can approach 99\% $\uparrow\downarrow$ accuracy, reaching the human
recognition ceiling with little visual deviation.

Abstract: Numerous efforts have been made to extend the ``next token prediction''
paradigm to visual contents, aiming to create a unified approach for both image
generation and understanding. Nevertheless, attempts to generate images through
autoregressive modeling with discrete tokens have been plagued by issues such
as low visual fidelity, distorted outputs, and failure to adhere to complex
instructions when rendering intricate details. These shortcomings are likely
attributed to cumulative errors during autoregressive inference or information
loss incurred during the discretization process. Probably due to this
challenge, recent research has increasingly shifted toward jointly training
image generation with diffusion objectives and language generation with
autoregressive objectives, moving away from unified modeling approaches. In
this work, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning can effectively mitigate
artifacts and largely enhance the generation quality of a discrete
autoregressive modeling method, thereby enabling seamless integration of image
and language generation. Our framework comprises a semantic image tokenizer, a
unified autoregressive model for both language and images, and an offline
diffusion decoder for image generation, termed X-Omni. X-Omni achieves
state-of-the-art performance in image generation tasks using a 7B language
model, producing images with high aesthetic quality while exhibiting strong
capabilities in following instructions and rendering long texts.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主动学习方法针对图像或短视频设计，不适用于长手术视频的步骤识别，因为需要整个视频的上下文进行标注。

Method: StepAL结合了步骤感知特征表示和熵加权聚类策略，优先选择不确定且步骤多样化的视频进行标注。

Result: 在Cataract-1k和Cataract-101数据集上，StepAL表现优于现有方法，以更少的标注视频实现更高的步骤识别准确率。

Conclusion: StepAL为手术视频分析提供了一种高效方法，降低了开发计算机辅助手术系统的标注负担。

Abstract: Active learning (AL) can reduce annotation costs in surgical video analysis
while maintaining model performance. However, traditional AL methods, developed
for images or short video clips, are suboptimal for surgical step recognition
due to inter-step dependencies within long, untrimmed surgical videos. These
methods typically select individual frames or clips for labeling, which is
ineffective for surgical videos where annotators require the context of the
entire video for annotation. To address this, we propose StepAL, an active
learning framework designed for full video selection in surgical step
recognition. StepAL integrates a step-aware feature representation, which
leverages pseudo-labels to capture the distribution of predicted steps within
each video, with an entropy-weighted clustering strategy. This combination
prioritizes videos that are both uncertain and exhibit diverse step
compositions for annotation. Experiments on two cataract surgery datasets
(Cataract-1k and Cataract-101) demonstrate that StepAL consistently outperforms
existing active learning approaches, achieving higher accuracy in step
recognition with fewer labeled videos. StepAL offers an effective approach for
efficient surgical video analysis, reducing the annotation burden in developing
computer-assisted surgical systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于运动引导的少样本视频对象分割（FSVOS）方法，并引入MOVE数据集，评估现有方法并提出新的基线模型DMA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FSVOS方法主要关注静态对象类别，忽略了视频中的动态运动模式，限制了其在需要运动理解的场景中的应用。

Method: 提出Decoupled Motion Appearance Network (DMA)作为基线方法，结合运动与外观特征进行分割。

Result: 实验表明，现有方法在运动引导FSVOS任务上表现不佳，而DMA在少样本运动理解中表现优越。

Conclusion: DMA为未来研究方向提供了坚实基础，并揭示了运动引导FSVOS的挑战。

Abstract: This work addresses motion-guided few-shot video object segmentation (FSVOS),
which aims to segment dynamic objects in videos based on a few annotated
examples with the same motion patterns. Existing FSVOS datasets and methods
typically focus on object categories, which are static attributes that ignore
the rich temporal dynamics in videos, limiting their application in scenarios
requiring motion understanding. To fill this gap, we introduce MOVE, a
large-scale dataset specifically designed for motion-guided FSVOS. Based on
MOVE, we comprehensively evaluate 6 state-of-the-art methods from 3 different
related tasks across 2 experimental settings. Our results reveal that current
methods struggle to address motion-guided FSVOS, prompting us to analyze the
associated challenges and propose a baseline method, Decoupled Motion
Appearance Network (DMA). Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior performance in few shot motion understanding, establishing a solid
foundation for future research in this direction.
