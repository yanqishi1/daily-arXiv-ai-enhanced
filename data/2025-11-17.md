### [1] [A Mathematical Framework for AI Singularity: Conditions, Bounds, and Control of Recursive Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10668)
*Akbar Anbar Jafari,Cagri Ozcinar,Gholamreza Anbarjafari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文开发了一个分析框架来研究AI能力是否会无限制增长，提出了可测试的条件来判断AI是否会失控发展，并提供了实际可用的安全控制措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI系统在什么可测量的条件下能力会无限制增长，以及在什么条件下可以排除这种可能性，用可测试的条件取代猜测。

Method: 开发递归自我改进的分析框架，将能力增长与资源建设和部署策略联系起来，利用物理和信息论限制定义服务边界，建立内生增长模型来区分超线性和次临界状态。

Result: 推导出将可观察序列映射到失控与非奇异行为的决策规则，提供了基于功率上限、吞吐量限制和评估门控等可直接实施的安全控制。

Conclusion: 该框架用可测试条件和可部署控制取代了对AI奇点的猜测，为认证或排除AI失控发展提供了理论基础和实践工具。

Abstract: AI systems improve by drawing on more compute, data, energy, and better training methods. This paper asks a precise, testable version of the "runaway growth" question: under what measurable conditions could capability escalate without bound in finite time, and under what conditions can that be ruled out? We develop an analytic framework for recursive self-improvement that links capability growth to resource build-out and deployment policies. Physical and information-theoretic limits from power, bandwidth, and memory define a service envelope that caps instantaneous improvement. An endogenous growth model couples capital to compute, data, and energy and defines a critical boundary separating superlinear from subcritical regimes. We derive decision rules that map observable series (facility power, IO bandwidth, training throughput, benchmark losses, and spending) into yes/no certificates for runaway versus nonsingular behavior. The framework yields falsifiable tests based on how fast improvement accelerates relative to its current level, and it provides safety controls that are directly implementable in practice, such as power caps, throughput throttling, and evaluation gates. Analytical case studies cover capped-power, saturating-data, and investment-amplified settings, illustrating when the envelope binds and when it does not. The approach is simulation-free and grounded in measurements engineers already collect. Limitations include dependence on the chosen capability metric and on regularity diagnostics; future work will address stochastic dynamics, multi-agent competition, and abrupt architectural shifts. Overall, the results replace speculation with testable conditions and deployable controls for certifying or precluding an AI singularity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像模型数据归因方法需要大量计算资源，在实际应用中不实用，需要开发更高效的归因方法。

Method: 将基于反学习的慢速归因方法蒸馏到特征嵌入空间，结合高效索引和搜索方法，无需运行昂贵的归因算法即可找到高影响力训练图像。

Result: 在MSCOCO训练的中等规模模型和LAION训练的大型Stable Diffusion模型上均取得优异结果，在几秒内达到更好或竞争性性能，比现有方法快2500-400000倍。

Conclusion: 该方法为实现数据归因方法在真实世界模型（如Stable Diffusion）上的大规模应用迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Data attribution for text-to-image models aims to identify the training images that most significantly influenced a generated output. Existing attribution methods involve considerable computational resources for each query, making them impractical for real-world applications. We propose a novel approach for scalable and efficient data attribution. Our key idea is to distill a slow, unlearning-based attribution method to a feature embedding space for efficient retrieval of highly influential training images. During deployment, combined with efficient indexing and search methods, our method successfully finds highly influential images without running expensive attribution algorithms. We show extensive results on both medium-scale models trained on MSCOCO and large-scale Stable Diffusion models trained on LAION, demonstrating that our method can achieve better or competitive performance in a few seconds, faster than existing methods by 2,500x - 400,000x. Our work represents a meaningful step towards the large-scale application of data attribution methods on real-world models such as Stable Diffusion.

TL;DR: 开发并验证了首个基于共识的视频评估工具ColoWorkflow，用于微创结直肠手术的工作流程分析，建立了可重复的评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微创结直肠手术存在程序变异性大、学习曲线困难、并发症影响质量和结果的问题，需要数据驱动的见解来减少变异性、优化培训和提高手术性能。

Method: 通过Delphi过程达成工作流程描述符共识，开发ColoWorkflow工具，并在多中心视频数据集上由独立评分者应用该工具，评估适用性和评分者间可靠性。

Result: 达成了10个程序无关阶段和34个程序特定步骤的共识，工具在54个手术视频中表现出广泛适用性，评分者间可靠性中等（阶段K=0.71，步骤K=0.66）。

Conclusion: ColoWorkflow为微创结直肠手术建立了可重复的视频性能评估框架，支持机构间基准测试和AI驱动的工作流程识别开发，有望标准化培训、加速能力获取和推进数据驱动的质量改进。

Abstract: Minimally invasive colorectal surgery is characterized by procedural variability, a difficult learning curve, and complications that impact quality and outcomes. Video-based assessment (VBA) offers an opportunity to generate data-driven insights to reduce variability, optimize training, and improve surgical performance. However, existing tools for workflow analysis remain difficult to standardize and implement. This study aims to develop and validate a VBA tool for workflow analysis across minimally invasive colorectal procedures. A Delphi process was conducted to achieve consensus on generalizable workflow descriptors. The resulting framework informed the development of a new VBA tool, ColoWorkflow. Independent raters then applied ColoWorkflow to a multicentre video dataset of laparoscopic and robotic colorectal surgery (CRS). Applicability and inter-rater reliability were evaluated. Consensus was achieved for 10 procedure-agnostic phases and 34 procedure-specific steps describing CRS workflows. ColoWorkflow was developed and applied to 54 colorectal operative videos (left and right hemicolectomies, sigmoid and rectosigmoid resections, and total proctocolectomies) from five centres. The tool demonstrated broad applicability, with all but one label utilized. Inter-rater reliability was moderate, with mean Cohen's K of 0.71 for phases and 0.66 for steps. Most discrepancies arose at phase transitions and step boundary definitions. ColoWorkflow is the first consensus-based, validated VBA tool for comprehensive workflow analysis in minimally invasive CRS. It establishes a reproducible framework for video-based performance assessment, enabling benchmarking across institutions and supporting the development of artificial intelligence-driven workflow recognition. Its adoption may standardize training, accelerate competency acquisition, and advance data-informed surgical quality improvement.

Method: 使用Layer-wise Relevance Propagation(LRP)技术进行模型剪枝，在少量数据条件下操作

Result: 相比现有方法，实现了更高的剪枝率同时更好地保持了模型准确率

Conclusion: 该方法在数据有限场景下实现了比现有方法更好的准确率保持效果

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used in image recognition and have succeeded in various domains. CNN models have become larger-scale to improve accuracy and generalization performance. Research has been conducted on compressing pre-trained models for specific target applications in environments with limited computing resources. Among model compression techniques, methods using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), an explainable AI technique, have shown promise by achieving high pruning rates while preserving accuracy, even without fine-tuning. Because these methods do not require fine-tuning, they are suited to scenarios with limited data. However, existing LRP-based pruning approaches still suffer from significant accuracy degradation, limiting their practical usability. This study proposes a pruning method that achieves a higher pruning rate while preserving better model accuracy. Our approach to pruning with a small amount of data has achieved pruning that preserves accuracy better than existing methods.

### [7] [PhaseWin Search Framework Enable Efficient Object-Level Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10914)
*Zihan Gu,Ruoyu Chen,Junchi Zhang,Yue Hu,Hua Zhang,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhaseWin是一种新颖的阶段窗口搜索算法，用于对象级基础模型的忠实区域归因，以近线性复杂度实现高效计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于子模子集选择的归因方法虽然忠实度高，但计算效率低，限制了在实际场景中的部署应用。

Method: 采用分阶段的粗到细搜索策略，结合自适应剪枝、窗口化细粒度选择和动态监督机制，替代传统的二次成本贪婪选择。

Result: 理论分析表明PhaseWin在温和单调子模假设下保持近贪婪近似保证；实证显示仅用20%计算预算即可达到贪婪方法95%以上的忠实度，在物体检测和视觉定位任务中优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: PhaseWin为对象级多模态模型建立了可扩展、高忠实度归因的新技术标准。

Abstract: Attribution is essential for interpreting object-level foundation models. Recent methods based on submodular subset selection have achieved high faithfulness, but their efficiency limitations hinder practical deployment in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose PhaseWin, a novel phase-window search algorithm that enables faithful region attribution with near-linear complexity. PhaseWin replaces traditional quadratic-cost greedy selection with a phased coarse-to-fine search, combining adaptive pruning, windowed fine-grained selection, and dynamic supervision mechanisms to closely approximate greedy behavior while dramatically reducing model evaluations. Theoretically, PhaseWin retains near-greedy approximation guarantees under mild monotone submodular assumptions. Empirically, PhaseWin achieves over 95% of greedy attribution faithfulness using only 20% of the computational budget, and consistently outperforms other attribution baselines across object detection and visual grounding tasks with Grounding DINO and Florence-2. PhaseWin establishes a new state of the art in scalable, high-faithfulness attribution for object-level multimodal models.

### [8] [Out-of-Distribution Detection with Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10923)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种正负提示监督方法，通过优化正负提示来增强基于能量的OOD检测性能，在多个基准数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法中的负提示通常包含广泛的非ID特征，可能捕获重叠或误导性信息，导致次优结果。

Method: 使用LLM初始化类别特定的正负提示，然后优化这些提示，正提示关注类内特征，负提示强调类别边界特征，并采用基于图的结构聚合语义监督。

Conclusion: 提出的正负提示监督方法能有效提升OOD检测性能，通过优化提示表示和语义知识传递实现了更好的检测效果。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is committed to delineating the classification boundaries between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable OOD detection performance by integrating both visual and textual modalities. In this context, negative prompts are introduced to emphasize the dissimilarity between image features and prompt content. However, these prompts often include a broad range of non-ID features, which may result in suboptimal outcomes due to the capture of overlapping or misleading information. To address this issue, we propose Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision, which encourages negative prompts to capture inter-class features and transfers this semantic knowledge to the visual modality to enhance OOD detection performance. Our method begins with class-specific positive and negative prompts initialized by large language models (LLMs). These prompts are subsequently optimized, with positive prompts focusing on features within each class, while negative prompts highlight features around category boundaries. Additionally, a graph-based architecture is employed to aggregate semantic-aware supervision from the optimized prompt representations and propagate it to the visual branch, thereby enhancing the performance of the energy-based OOD detector. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K, across eight OOD datasets and five different LLMs, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了YOLOv11n和YOLOv12n两种轻量级模型在面部表情识别任务中的表现，发现在干净数据集上YOLOv12n性能更优，而在噪声现实环境中YOLOv11n精度更高，展示了轻量级YOLO模型在实时情感AI应用中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面部表情识别在无约束真实环境中仍具挑战性，本研究旨在探索最新YOLO系列轻量级模型在统一检测和分类框架下的FER性能。

Method: 将FER2013和KDEF两个基准分类数据集转换为目标检测格式，使用YOLOv11n和YOLOv12n模型，通过mAP 0.5、精确率、召回率和混淆矩阵评估性能。

Result: YOLOv12n在干净的KDEF数据集上获得最高mAP 0.5为95.6，在FER2013数据集上mAP为63.8，表现更强敏感性；YOLOv11n在FER2013上精确率达65.2，假阳性更少。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了敏感性与精确度之间的权衡，轻量级YOLO模型能有效平衡性能与效率，适用于实时、资源受限的情感AI应用场景。

Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition remains a challenging task, especially in unconstrained, real-world environments. This study investigates the performance of two lightweight models, YOLOv11n and YOLOv12n, which are the nano variants of the latest official YOLO series, within a unified detection and classification framework for FER. Two benchmark classification datasets, FER2013 and KDEF, are converted into object detection format and model performance is evaluated using mAP 0.5, precision, recall, and confusion matrices. Results show that YOLOv12n achieves the highest overall performance on the clean KDEF dataset with a mAP 0.5 of 95.6, and also outperforms YOLOv11n on the FER2013 dataset in terms of mAP 63.8, reflecting stronger sensitivity to varied expressions. In contrast, YOLOv11n demonstrates higher precision 65.2 on FER2013, indicating fewer false positives and better reliability in noisy, real-world conditions. On FER2013, both models show more confusion between visually similar expressions, while clearer class separation is observed on the cleaner KDEF dataset. These findings underscore the trade-off between sensitivity and precision, illustrating how lightweight YOLO models can effectively balance performance and efficiency. The results demonstrate adaptability across both controlled and real-world conditions, establishing these models as strong candidates for real-time, resource-constrained emotion-aware AI applications.

### [10] [Heterogeneous Complementary Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10942)
*Liuchi Xu,Hao Zheng,Lu Wang,Lisheng Xu,Jun Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Heterogeneous Complementary Distillation (HCD)框架，通过整合教师和学生的互补特征来对齐共享logits表示，解决异构架构知识蒸馏中的特征表示差异问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异构架构知识蒸馏（如ViT到ResNet18）面临空间特征表示差异的挑战，传统同构KD方法难以有效解决，现有异构KD方法计算成本高、设计复杂或过度依赖logit对齐，限制了互补特征的利用。

Method: HCD框架通过卷积投影器和自适应池化处理学生中间特征，与教师倒数第二层特征拼接，通过Complementary Feature Mapper模块生成共享logits；引入Sub-logit Decoupled Distillation将共享logits划分为n个子logits，与教师logits融合以修正分类；提出Orthogonality Loss确保子logit多样性并减少冗余知识转移。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、细粒度数据集（如CUB200）和ImageNet-1K上的广泛实验表明，HCD优于最先进的KD方法。

Conclusion: HCD通过保留学生特定优势并利用教师知识，增强了学生的鲁棒性和泛化能力，是异构知识蒸馏的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD)transfers the dark knowledge from a complex teacher to a compact student. However, heterogeneous architecture distillation, such as Vision Transformer (ViT) to ResNet18, faces challenges due to differences in spatial feature representations.Traditional KD methods are mostly designed for homogeneous architectures and hence struggle to effectively address the disparity. Although heterogeneous KD approaches have been developed recently to solve these issues, they often incur high computational costs and complex designs, or overly rely on logit alignment, which limits their ability to leverage the complementary features. To overcome these limitations, we propose Heterogeneous Complementary Distillation (HCD),a simple yet effective framework that integrates complementary teacher and student features to align representations in shared logits.These logits are decomposed and constrained to facilitate diverse knowledge transfer to the student. Specifically, HCD processes the student's intermediate features through convolutional projector and adaptive pooling, concatenates them with teacher's feature from the penultimate layer and then maps them via the Complementary Feature Mapper (CFM) module, comprising fully connected layer,to produce shared logits.We further introduce Sub-logit Decoupled Distillation (SDD) that partitions the shared logits into n sub-logits, which are fused with teacher's logits to rectify classification.To ensure sub-logit diversity and reduce redundant knowledge transfer, we propose an Orthogonality Loss (OL).By preserving student-specific strengths and leveraging teacher knowledge,HCD enhances robustness and generalization in students.Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100, Fine-grained (e.g., CUB200)and ImageNet-1K datasets demonstrate that HCD outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods,establishing it as an effective solution for heterogeneous KD.

Result: 在两个公共数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法展现出显著的性能表现。

Conclusion: FedBCS通过领域不变上下文原型对齐有效解决了联邦学习中的特征异质性问题，提高了分割模型的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Federated learning enables multiple medical institutions to train a global model without sharing data, yet feature heterogeneity from diverse scanners or protocols remains a major challenge. Many existing works attempt to address this issue by leveraging model representations (e.g., mean feature vectors) to correct local training; however, they often face two key limitations: 1) Incomplete Contextual Representation Learning: Current approaches primarily focus on final-layer features, overlooking critical multi-level cues and thus diluting essential context for accurate segmentation. 2) Layerwise Style Bias Accumulation: Although utilizing representations can partially align global features, these methods neglect domain-specific biases within intermediate layers, allowing style discrepancies to build up and reduce model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose FedBCS to bridge feature representation gaps via domain-invariant contextual prototypes alignment. Specifically, we introduce a frequency-domain adaptive style recalibration into prototype construction that not only decouples content-style representations but also learns optimal style parameters, enabling more robust domain-invariant prototypes. Furthermore, we design a context-aware dual-level prototype alignment method that extracts domain-invariant prototypes from different layers of both encoder and decoder and fuses them with contextual information for finer-grained representation alignment. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our method exhibits remarkable performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出DEFT-LLM方法，通过多专家解耦实现微表情识别中的运动语义对齐，解决了静态外观与动态运动线索纠缠以及文本标签与面部肌肉运动语义差距的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情识别对推断真实情绪至关重要，但现有方法面临两个核心挑战：静态外观与动态运动线索的纠缠阻碍模型关注细微运动；现有数据集的文本标签与面部肌肉运动不完全对应，存在语义差距。

Method: 提出DEFT-LLM方法，首先构建Uni-MER运动驱动指令数据集，利用光流和动作单元标签的双重约束确保时空一致性和运动对应性；然后设计三专家架构将面部动态解耦为独立可解释的表征（结构、动态纹理和运动语义）。

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的微表情识别基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，并在局部面部运动的可解释建模方面表现出特别优势。

Conclusion: 通过将Uni-MER的指令对齐知识集成到DEFT-LLM中，该方法为微表情注入有效的物理先验，同时利用大语言模型的跨模态推理能力，从而能够精确捕捉细微的情绪线索。

Abstract: Micro expression recognition (MER) is crucial for inferring genuine emotion. Applying a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to this task enables spatio-temporal analysis of facial motion and provides interpretable descriptions. However, there are still two core challenges: (1) The entanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion cues prevents the model from focusing on subtle motion; (2) Textual labels in existing MER datasets do not fully correspond to underlying facial muscle movements, creating a semantic gap between text supervision and physical motion. To address these issues, we propose DEFT-LLM, which achieves motion semantic alignment by multi-expert disentanglement. We first introduce Uni-MER, a motion-driven instruction dataset designed to align text with local facial motion. Its construction leverages dual constraints from optical flow and Action Unit (AU) labels to ensure spatio-temporal consistency and reasonable correspondence to the movements. We then design an architecture with three experts to decouple facial dynamics into independent and interpretable representations (structure, dynamic textures, and motion-semantics). By integrating the instruction-aligned knowledge from Uni-MER into DEFT-LLM, our method injects effective physical priors for micro expressions while also leveraging the cross modal reasoning ability of large language models, thus enabling precise capture of subtle emotional cues. Experiments on multiple challenging MER benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, as well as a particular advantage in interpretable modeling of local facial motion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统MoE架构中路由器逻辑与专家内部结构不匹配导致的路由不稳定、专家利用不足，以及负载不平衡造成的瓶颈问题，同时避免辅助负载平衡损失对专家专业化的负面影响。

Method: 将每个专家重新参数化为学习正交特征基，用特征基分数（输入特征与专家基的余弦相似度）替代学习门控逻辑，实现内容感知路由，无需显式平衡损失。

Result: 在ImageNet分类和跨模态图像-文本检索基准（如COCO、Flickr30K）上达到最先进精度，自然产生更平坦的专家负载分布。3D MRI变体（ERMoE-ba）将脑年龄预测精度提高7%以上，并产生解剖学可解释的专家专业化。

Conclusion: ERMoE为稀疏专家模型引入新的架构原则，直接解决路由不稳定性，在保持稀疏性的同时实现可扩展、可解释的专业化，提升性能。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures expand model capacity by sparsely activating experts but face two core challenges: misalignment between router logits and each expert's internal structure leads to unstable routing and expert underutilization, and load imbalances create straggler bottlenecks. Standard solutions, such as auxiliary load-balancing losses, can reduce load disparities but often weaken expert specialization and hurt downstream performance. To address these issues, we propose ERMoE, a sparse MoE transformer that reparameterizes each expert in a learned orthonormal eigenbasis and replaces learned gating logits with an "Eigenbasis Score", defined as the cosine similarity between input features and an expert's basis. This content-aware routing ties token assignments directly to experts' representation spaces, stabilizing utilization and promoting interpretable specialization without sacrificing sparsity. Crucially, ERMoE removes the need for explicit balancing losses and avoids the interfering gradients they introduce. We show that ERMoE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet classification and cross-modal image-text retrieval benchmarks (e.g., COCO, Flickr30K), while naturally producing flatter expert load distributions. Moreover, a 3D MRI variant (ERMoE-ba) improves brain age prediction accuracy by more than 7\% and yields anatomically interpretable expert specializations. ERMoE thus introduces a new architectural principle for sparse expert models that directly addresses routing instabilities and enables improved performance with scalable, interpretable specialization.

TL;DR: DMC是一个用于CLIP模型类增量学习的两阶段框架，通过解耦视觉编码器适配和文本软提示优化来解决分类器偏差问题。DMC-OT是其增强版本，引入最优传输校准策略来对齐内存统计信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP模型在持续学习新类别时面临分类器偏差问题，文本原型容易过拟合到最新类别，且现有方法忽略了视觉编码器更新带来的分布漂移问题。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：第一阶段冻结文本提示训练视觉编码器，第二阶段冻结视觉编码器训练文本软提示。DMC-OT额外引入最优传输校准策略来对齐内存统计信息，并采用任务特定的提示设计增强任务间可分性。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、Imagenet-R、CUB-200和UCF-101上的实验表明，DMC和DMC-OT都达到了最先进的性能，DMC-OT进一步将准确率平均提高了1.80%。

Conclusion: DMC框架通过解耦视觉和文本模态的训练有效缓解了类增量学习中的分类器偏差问题，DMC-OT通过最优传输校准进一步提升了性能，为CLIP模型的持续学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) enables models to continuously learn new categories from sequential tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. While recent advances in vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong generalization across domains, extending them to continual settings remains challenging. In particular, learning task-specific soft prompts for newly introduced classes often leads to severe classifier bias, as the text prototypes overfit to recent categories when prior data are unavailable. In this paper, we propose DMC, a simple yet effective two-stage framework for CLIP-based CIL that decouples the adaptation of the vision encoder and the optimization of textual soft prompts. Each stage is trained with the other frozen, allowing one modality to act as a stable semantic anchor for the other to preserve cross-modal alignment. Furthermore, current CLIP-based CIL approaches typically store class-wise Gaussian statistics for generative replay, yet they overlook the distributional drift that arises when the vision encoder is updated over time. To address this issue, we introduce DMC-OT, an enhanced version of DMC that incorporates an optimal-transport guided calibration strategy to align memory statistics across evolving encoders, along with a task-specific prompting design that enhances inter-task separability. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, Imagenet-R, CUB-200, and UCF-101 demonstrate that both DMC and DMC-OT achieve state-of-the-art performance, with DMC-OT further improving accuracy by an average of 1.80%.

*Bowen Sun,Yujun Cai,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Hang Wu,Yiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS)方法，解决视频LLMs中的时间不一致性问题，通过多相位平滑技术稳定注意力机制，在多个视频理解基准测试中取得一致改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频LLMs存在时间不一致性问题：帧时序的微小变化会导致注意力翻转并抑制相关帧。这种不稳定性源于多模态RoPE扩展引起的逆傅里叶时间核的帧尺度波动。

Method: 提出Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS)，一种无需训练的方法，通过在不同注意力头应用相反的相位偏移并聚合输出，平滑时间核并减少相位敏感性，同时保持位置编码结构不变。

Result: 在多个视频理解基准测试中，在相同token预算下获得了一致的性能提升，计算开销可忽略不计。

Conclusion: PAS为视频LLMs提供了即插即用的鲁棒时间编码升级方案，通过平滑时间核实现注意力对微小时间偏移的Lipschitz稳定性。

Abstract: Video LLMs suffer from temporal inconsistency: small shifts in frame timing can flip attention and suppress relevant frames. We trace this instability to the common extension of Rotary Position Embeddings to video through multimodal RoPE. The induced inverse Fourier time kernel exhibits frame-scale ripples that multiply adjacent frames by different factors, which perturbs attention that should otherwise be governed by the raw query key inner product. We present Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS), a simple, training-free mechanism that applies small opposed phase offsets across heads and then aggregates their outputs. PAS preserves the per-head spectrum magnitude, while the aggregation effectively smooths the temporal kernel and reduces phase sensitivity without changing the positional encoding structure. Our analysis shows that the RoPE rotated logit can be approximated as a content dot product scaled by a time kernel; smoothing this kernel yields Lipschitz stability of attention to small temporal shifts; multi phase averaging attenuates high frequency ripples while preserving per-head spectra under Nyquist-valid sampling. Experiments on multiple video understanding benchmarks under matched token budgets show consistent improvements with negligible computational overhead. PAS provides a plug and play upgrade for robust temporal encoding in Video LLMs.

*Jeffrey Liu,Rongbin Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的二值验证工作流，通过量化和二值化将开放性问题转化为多项选择题和真/假验证问题，显著提升零样本视觉任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现成视觉语言模型在零样本视觉任务中处理开放式查询时的性能限制，作者希望通过推理时设计而非任务特定训练来提升模型表现。

Method: 工作流包含两个步骤：(1) 量化：将开放式查询转化为具有明确候选答案的多项选择题；(2) 二值化：为每个候选答案提出真/假问题，通过确定性逻辑进行选择。

Result: 在指代表达式定位、空间推理和BLINK-Jigsaw等任务上，量化到多项选择题带来了显著提升，真/假二值化进一步提供了稳定的性能增益。

Conclusion: 该工作流提供了一个简单统一的推理时解决方案，强调推理时设计而非任务特定训练，为当前视觉语言模型提供了实用的零样本视觉能力提升路径。

Abstract: We propose a training-free, binary verification workflow for zero-shot vision with off-the-shelf VLMs. It comprises two steps: (i) quantization, which turns the open-ended query into a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with a small, explicit list of unambiguous candidates; and (ii) binarization, which asks one True/False question per candidate and resolves deterministically: if exactly one is True, select it; otherwise, revert to an MCQ over the remaining plausible candidates. We evaluate the workflow on referring expression grounding (REC), spatial reasoning (Spatial-Map, Spatial-Grid, Spatial-Maze), and BLINK-Jigsaw. Relative to answering open-ended queries directly, quantization to MCQ yields large gains, and True/False binarization provides a consistent additional boost. Across all tasks, the same workflow produces significant improvements, indicating generality. Our theory formalizes how open-ended vision queries can be quantized to MCQs and further binarized into True/False verifications, establishing a hardness ladder. A simple analysis explains why Boolean resolution boosts accuracy. Together, these components yield a simple and unified workflow that emphasizes inference-time design over task-specific training. It offers a practical, drop-in path to stronger zero-shot vision with today's VLMs.

TL;DR: CLUE是一个基于Stable Diffusion的生成模型框架，通过固定格式提示实现多样且稳定的图像生成，无需额外数据，在医学领域等数据有限的专门领域中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像合成模型在专门领域（如医学）中数据有限时难以同时实现多样性和稳定性的问题。

Method: 基于Stable Diffusion架构，使用风格编码器处理图像和提示生成风格嵌入，通过新的第二注意力层和KL散度实现与提示无关的连续高斯区域潜在空间表示。

Result: 在中耳炎数据集上，FID从46.81降至9.30，召回率从49.60%提升至70.29%。仅使用合成数据训练的分类器在1000%规模下F1得分达83.21%，结合真实数据可达94.76%。

Conclusion: CLUE能够从有限数据集中实现多样且稳定的图像生成，是领域特定应用的有效数据增强方法。

Abstract: Text-to-image synthesis models require the ability to generate diverse images while maintaining stability. To overcome this challenge, a number of methods have been proposed, including the collection of prompt-image datasets and the integration of additional data modalities during training. Although these methods have shown promising results in general domains, they face limitations when applied to specialized fields such as medicine, where only limited types and insufficient amounts of data are available. We present CLUE (Controllable Latent space of Unprompted Embeddings), a generative model framework that achieves diverse generation while maintaining stability through fixed-format prompts without requiring any additional data. Based on the Stable Diffusion architecture, CLUE employs a Style Encoder that processes images and prompts to generate style embeddings, which are subsequently fed into a new second attention layer of the U-Net architecture. Through Kullback-Leibler divergence, the latent space achieves continuous representation of image features within Gaussian regions, independent of prompts. Performance was assessed on otitis media dataset. CLUE reduced FID to 9.30 (vs. 46.81) and improved recall to 70.29% (vs. 49.60%). A classifier trained on synthetic-only data at 1000% scale achieved an F1 score of 83.21% (vs. 73.83%). Combining synthetic data with equal amounts of real data achieved an F1 score of 94.76%, higher than when using only real data. On an external dataset, synthetic-only training achieved an F1 score of 76.77% (vs. 60.61%) at 1000% scale. The combined approach achieved an F1 score of 85.78%, higher than when using only the internal dataset. These results demonstrate that CLUE enables diverse yet stable image generation from limited datasets and serves as an effective data augmentation method for domain-specific applications.

*Jiajun Chen,Sai Cheng,Yutao Yuan,Yirui Zhang,Haitao Yuan,Peng Peng,Yi Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PROMISE是一个新颖的多模态框架，通过提示注意力分层对比学习来解决模态缺失问题，显著提升了在模态不完整情况下的跨模态表示鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态模型在真实场景中面临模态缺失时性能显著下降，主要原因是完整多模态数据与不完整模态场景之间的表示学习不一致。现有方法通过相对简单的生成方法处理缺失模态，但无法充分保持跨模态一致性。

Method: PROMISE将多模态提示学习创新性地融入分层对比学习框架，配备专门设计的提示注意力机制，动态生成针对缺失模态场景的鲁棒且一致的表示。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验和综合消融研究明确证明，PROMISE相比当前最先进的多模态方法具有优越性能。

Conclusion: PROMISE通过提示注意力分层对比学习有效弥合了完整数据与不完整数据之间的表示差距，为模态缺失情况下的跨模态表示学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal models integrating natural language and visual information have substantially improved generalization of representation models. However, their effectiveness significantly declines in real-world situations where certain modalities are missing or unavailable. This degradation primarily stems from inconsistent representation learning between complete multimodal data and incomplete modality scenarios. Existing approaches typically address missing modalities through relatively simplistic generation methods, yet these approaches fail to adequately preserve cross-modal consistency, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multimodal framework named PROMISE, a PROMpting-Attentive HIerarchical ContraStive LEarning approach designed explicitly for robust cross-modal representation under conditions of missing modalities. Specifically, PROMISE innovatively incorporates multimodal prompt learning into a hierarchical contrastive learning framework, equipped with a specially designed prompt-attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically generates robust and consistent representations for scenarios where particular modalities are absent, thereby effectively bridging the representational gap between complete and incomplete data. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, along with comprehensive ablation studies, clearly demonstrate the superior performance of PROMISE compared to current state-of-the-art multimodal methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EmoVid是首个为创意媒体设计的多模态情感标注视频数据集，包含卡通动画、电影片段和动画贴纸，通过情感条件化视频生成技术显著提升了视频生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成系统主要关注低层次视觉指标而忽视情感维度，视频领域缺乏专门资源来连接情感理解与生成任务，特别是在风格化和非现实背景下。

Method: 引入EmoVid数据集，每个视频都标注了情感标签、视觉属性和文本描述；基于这些洞察开发了情感条件化视频生成技术，通过微调Wan2.1模型实现。

Result: 在文本到视频和图像到视频任务中，生成视频的定量指标和视觉质量都有显著提升。

Conclusion: EmoVid为情感视频计算建立了新基准，不仅为艺术风格视频中的视觉情感分析提供了宝贵见解，还为增强视频生成中的情感表达提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Emotion plays a pivotal role in video-based expression, but existing video generation systems predominantly focus on low-level visual metrics while neglecting affective dimensions. Although emotion analysis has made progress in the visual domain, the video community lacks dedicated resources to bridge emotion understanding with generative tasks, particularly for stylized and non-realistic contexts. To address this gap, we introduce EmoVid, the first multimodal, emotion-annotated video dataset specifically designed for creative media, which includes cartoon animations, movie clips, and animated stickers. Each video is annotated with emotion labels, visual attributes (brightness, colorfulness, hue), and text captions. Through systematic analysis, we uncover spatial and temporal patterns linking visual features to emotional perceptions across diverse video forms. Building on these insights, we develop an emotion-conditioned video generation technique by fine-tuning the Wan2.1 model. The results show a significant improvement in both quantitative metrics and the visual quality of generated videos for text-to-video and image-to-video tasks. EmoVid establishes a new benchmark for affective video computing. Our work not only offers valuable insights into visual emotion analysis in artistically styled videos, but also provides practical methods for enhancing emotional expression in video generation.

TL;DR: VisMem是一个受人类认知记忆理论启发的视觉语言模型框架，通过短期和长期视觉记忆模块解决视觉处理瓶颈问题，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在复杂视觉任务中存在视觉处理瓶颈，容易失去视觉证据的根基，在长序列生成中缺乏情境化的视觉体验。

Method: 基于人类认知记忆理论，提出VisMem框架，包含短期视觉主导记忆模块用于细粒度感知保留，和长期语义主导记忆模块用于抽象语义整合，在推理过程中动态调用这些记忆。

Result: 在多个视觉理解、推理和生成基准测试中，VisMem相比原始模型平均性能提升11.8%，优于所有对比方法。

Conclusion: VisMem建立了一种新的潜在空间记忆增强范式，能够同时保持感知保真度和语义一致性。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their performance on a range of complex visual tasks is often hindered by a "visual processing bottleneck": a propensity to lose grounding in visual evidence and exhibit a deficit in contextualized visual experience during prolonged generation. Drawing inspiration from human cognitive memory theory, which distinguishes short-term visually-dominant memory and long-term semantically-dominant memory, we propose VisMem, a cognitively-aligned framework that equips VLMs with dynamic latent vision memories, a short-term module for fine-grained perceptual retention and a long-term module for abstract semantic consolidation. These memories are seamlessly invoked during inference, allowing VLMs to maintain both perceptual fidelity and semantic consistency across thinking and generation. Extensive experiments across diverse visual benchmarks for understanding, reasoning, and generation reveal that VisMem delivers a significant average performance boost of 11.8% relative to the vanilla model and outperforms all counterparts, establishing a new paradigm for latent-space memory enhancement. The code will be available: https://github.com/YU-deep/VisMem.git.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SP-Guard是一种针对扩散式文本到图像模型的安全防护方法，通过估计提示词危害性并应用选择性引导掩码，仅对图像中的不安全区域进行引导，在提高安全性的同时最小化内容改变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理时引导方法缺乏自适应性和选择性，无法根据提示词调整引导强度，也无法仅针对图像中的不安全区域进行引导，这限制了安全生成的效果。

Method: 通过估计提示词的危害程度，并应用选择性引导掩码，仅对图像中被识别为不安全的区域进行引导，而不影响安全内容。

Result: 实验表明，SP-Guard比现有方法生成更安全的图像，同时最大限度地减少了意外内容改变。

Conclusion: 除了提高安全性外，该研究还强调了图像生成中透明度和可控性的重要性。

Abstract: While diffusion-based T2I models have achieved remarkable image generation quality, they also enable easy creation of harmful content, raising social concerns and highlighting the need for safer generation. Existing inference-time guiding methods lack both adaptivity--adjusting guidance strength based on the prompt--and selectivity--targeting only unsafe regions of the image. Our method, SP-Guard, addresses these limitations by estimating prompt harmfulness and applying a selective guidance mask to guide only unsafe areas. Experiments show that SP-Guard generates safer images than existing methods while minimizing unintended content alteration. Beyond improving safety, our findings highlight the importance of transparency and controllability in image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的跳跃连接编码器-解码器架构（U-Net变体）在逆问题中仍存在信息损失问题，限制了细粒度高频细节的恢复。

Method: 利用小波的完美重建特性防止信息退化，同时选择性抑制冗余特征，作为即插即用解码器块集成到各种U-Net变体中。

Conclusion: SUPER解码器块具有即插即用的通用性，在统一的重建感知框架内实现高频保真度和全局一致性。

Abstract: Skip-connected encoder-decoder architectures (U-Net variants) are widely adopted for inverse problems but still suffer from information loss, limiting recovery of fine high-frequency details. We present Selectively Suppressed Perfect Reconstruction (SUPER), which exploits the perfect reconstruction (PR) property of wavelets to prevent information degradation while selectively suppressing (SS) redundant features. Free from rigid framelet constraints, SUPER serves as a plug-and-play decoder block for diverse U-Net variants, eliminating their intrinsic reconstruction bottlenecks and enhancing representational richness. Experiments across diverse crack benchmarks, including state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, demonstrate the structural potential of the proposed SUPER Decoder Block. Maintaining comparable computational cost, SUPER enriches representational diversity through increased parameterization. In small-scale in-domain experiments on the CrackVision12K dataset, SUPER markedly improves thin-crack segmentation performance, particularly for cracks narrower than 4 px, underscoring its advantage in high-frequency dominant settings. In smartphone image denoising on SIDD, where low-frequency components prevail, SUPER still achieves a moderate gain in PSNR, confirming its robustness across low- and high-frequency regimes. These results validate its plug-and-play generality across U-Net variants, achieving high-frequency fidelity and global coherence within a unified, reconstruction-aware framework.

Motivation: 现有基准主要针对单智能体高质量图像的基本感知任务，缺乏评估多智能体协作感知的基准，特别是在复杂、以自我为中心的协作场景和真实世界退化感知条件下。

Method: 构建包含模拟器和真实世界数据的基准，通过模型、规则和人工方法在严格质量控制下生成大规模问题，涵盖场景理解、物体理解、感知评估和协作决策四个维度。

Result: 对40个MLLM的评估显示在协作感知任务中存在显著性能差距，最佳模型平均落后人类24.38%，且在不同任务间表现不一致。微调实验证实了空中协作感知和推理中模拟到真实迁移的可行性。

Conclusion: AirCopBench填补了多智能体协作感知评估的空白，揭示了当前MLLM在复杂协作场景中的局限性，并为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in single-agent vision tasks, yet benchmarks for evaluating multi-agent collaborative perception remain scarce. This gap is critical, as multi-drone systems provide enhanced coverage, robustness, and collaboration compared to single-sensor setups. Existing multi-image benchmarks mainly target basic perception tasks using high-quality single-agent images, thus failing to evaluate MLLMs in more complex, egocentric collaborative scenarios, especially under real-world degraded perception conditions.To address these challenges, we introduce AirCopBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in embodied aerial collaborative perception under challenging perceptual conditions. AirCopBench includes 14.6k+ questions derived from both simulator and real-world data, spanning four key task dimensions: Scene Understanding, Object Understanding, Perception Assessment, and Collaborative Decision, across 14 task types. We construct the benchmark using data from challenging degraded-perception scenarios with annotated collaborative events, generating large-scale questions through model-, rule-, and human-based methods under rigorous quality control. Evaluations on 40 MLLMs show significant performance gaps in collaborative perception tasks, with the best model trailing humans by 24.38% on average and exhibiting inconsistent results across tasks. Fine-tuning experiments further confirm the feasibility of sim-to-real transfer in aerial collaborative perception and reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有判别模型未能利用胚胎发育的分布先验来提高准确性，且依赖单焦点信息导致胚胎表示不完整，容易在细胞遮挡下出现特征模糊。

Method: 提出两阶段扩散框架：1）训练冻结帧级编码器提取鲁棒多焦点特征；2）引入多焦点特征融合策略构建3D感知形态表示，设计混合语义边界条件块注入扩散去噪过程。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上实现最先进结果，仅需单次去噪步骤即可达到82.8%和81.3%的平均测试准确率。

Conclusion: EmbryoDiff通过扩散建模和多焦点融合有效解决了胚胎发育阶段识别中的特征模糊问题，显著提升了分类性能。

Abstract: Identification of fine-grained embryo developmental stages during In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) is crucial for assessing embryo viability. Although recent deep learning methods have achieved promising accuracy, existing discriminative models fail to utilize the distributional prior of embryonic development to improve accuracy. Moreover, their reliance on single-focal information leads to incomplete embryonic representations, making them susceptible to feature ambiguity under cell occlusions. To address these limitations, we propose EmbryoDiff, a two-stage diffusion-based framework that formulates the task as a conditional sequence denoising process. Specifically, we first train and freeze a frame-level encoder to extract robust multi-focal features. In the second stage, we introduce a Multi-Focal Feature Fusion Strategy that aggregates information across focal planes to construct a 3D-aware morphological representation, effectively alleviating ambiguities arising from cell occlusions. Building on this fused representation, we derive complementary semantic and boundary cues and design a Hybrid Semantic-Boundary Condition Block to inject them into the diffusion-based denoising process, enabling accurate embryonic stage classification. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Notably, with only a single denoising step, our model obtains the best average test performance, reaching 82.8% and 81.3% accuracy on the two datasets, respectively.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合粒度缓存方法（HGC），通过在可控生成模型的不同计算阶段采用不同粒度的缓存策略来显著降低计算开销，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决可控生成模型在处理控制条件和内容生成时计算效率低下的问题，旨在减少计算开销同时保持生成质量。

Method: 采用两种缓存策略：1）粗粒度缓存（块级）-基于特征重用在编码器-解码器块间动态绕过冗余计算；2）细粒度缓存（提示级）-在模块内重用跨注意力图并扩展到相邻步骤的对应模块计算。

Result: 在COCO-Stuff分割基准测试中，计算成本（MACs）显著降低63%（从18.22T到6.70T），语义保真度损失控制在1.5%以内。

Conclusion: HGC方法在四个基准数据集上验证了其有效性，特别是在平衡生成效率和视觉质量方面具有优势。

Abstract: Controllable generative models have been widely used to improve the realism of synthetic visual content. However, such models must handle control conditions and content generation computational requirements, resulting in generally low generation efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a Hybrid-Grained Cache (HGC) approach that reduces computational overhead by adopting cache strategies with different granularities at different computational stages. Specifically, (1) we use a coarse-grained cache (block-level) based on feature reuse to dynamically bypass redundant computations in encoder-decoder blocks between each step of model reasoning. (2) We design a fine-grained cache (prompt-level) that acts within a module, where the fine-grained cache reuses cross-attention maps within consecutive reasoning steps and extends them to the corresponding module computations of adjacent steps. These caches of different granularities can be seamlessly integrated into each computational link of the controllable generation process. We verify the effectiveness of HGC on four benchmark datasets, especially its advantages in balancing generation efficiency and visual quality. For example, on the COCO-Stuff segmentation benchmark, our HGC significantly reduces the computational cost (MACs) by 63% (from 18.22T to 6.70T), while keeping the loss of semantic fidelity (quantized performance degradation) within 1.5%.

TL;DR: CrossMed是一个评估医学多模态大语言模型组合泛化能力的基准，使用模态-解剖-任务(MAT)框架，将四个公共数据集统一为视觉问答格式，包含20,200个多选题实例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学多模态大语言模型在未见过的成像模态、解剖结构和任务类型组合上的泛化能力尚未充分探索，需要专门的基准来评估其组合泛化能力。

Method: 将CheXpert、SIIM-ACR、BraTS 2020和MosMedData四个数据集重新格式化为统一的视觉问答格式，使用MAT框架构建相关和不相关的训练测试分割，以及零重叠设置。

Result: 在相关分割上模型达到83.2%分类准确率和0.75分割cIoU，但在不相关和零重叠条件下性能显著下降。跨任务迁移显示仅使用分类数据训练也能提升分割性能7% cIoU。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在组合泛化方面表现优异，CrossMed为评估医学视觉语言模型的零样本、跨任务和模态无关泛化提供了严格测试平台。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models have enabled unified processing of visual and textual inputs, offering promising applications in general-purpose medical AI. However, their ability to generalize compositionally across unseen combinations of imaging modality, anatomy, and task type remains underexplored. We introduce CrossMed, a benchmark designed to evaluate compositional generalization (CG) in medical multimodal LLMs using a structured Modality-Anatomy-Task (MAT) schema. CrossMed reformulates four public datasets, CheXpert (X-ray classification), SIIM-ACR (X-ray segmentation), BraTS 2020 (MRI classification and segmentation), and MosMedData (CT classification) into a unified visual question answering (VQA) format, resulting in 20,200 multiple-choice QA instances. We evaluate two open-source multimodal LLMs, LLaVA-Vicuna-7B and Qwen2-VL-7B, on both Related and Unrelated MAT splits, as well as a zero-overlap setting where test triplets share no Modality, Anatomy, or Task with the training data. Models trained on Related splits achieve 83.2 percent classification accuracy and 0.75 segmentation cIoU, while performance drops significantly under Unrelated and zero-overlap conditions, demonstrating the benchmark difficulty. We also show cross-task transfer, where segmentation performance improves by 7 percent cIoU even when trained using classification-only data. Traditional models (ResNet-50 and U-Net) show modest gains, confirming the broad utility of the MAT framework, while multimodal LLMs uniquely excel at compositional generalization. CrossMed provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating zero-shot, cross-task, and modality-agnostic generalization in medical vision-language models.

Result: 在MVImgNet和MureCom数据集上的大量实验表明，生成模型可以从校准的参考特征中大大受益。

Conclusion: 通过多参考图像和特征校准，生成式图像合成模型能够更好地同时实现细节保持和前景姿态/视角调整。

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert foreground object into background. Despite the huge progress in generative image composition, the existing methods are still struggling with simultaneous detail preservation and foreground pose/view adjustment. To address this issue, we extend the existing generative composition model to multi-reference version, which allows using arbitrary number of foreground reference images. Furthermore, we propose to calibrate the global and local features of foreground reference images to make them compatible with the background information. The calibrated reference features can supplement the original reference features with useful global and local information of proper pose/view. Extensive experiments on MVImgNet and MureCom demonstrate that the generative model can greatly benefit from the calibrated reference features.

Motivation: 现有扩散变换器在视频生成中面临二次注意力复杂度的瓶颈，动态稀疏注意力方法计算开销大且存在估计误差，而静态稀疏模式在整个去噪过程中保持固定且往往不是最优的。

Method: 识别扩散注意力的时间相干性特性，提出LiteAttention方法，利用这种相干性在去噪序列中实现进化计算跳过，通过早期标记非必要tile并向前传播跳过决策来消除冗余注意力计算。

Result: 在FlashAttention基础上实现高度优化的LiteAttention内核，在生成视频扩散模型上实现显著加速，且没有质量下降。

Conclusion: LiteAttention结合了动态方法的适应性和静态方法的效率，通过利用时间相干性有效解决了扩散变换器的注意力复杂度问题。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers, particularly for video generation, achieve remarkable quality but suffer from quadratic attention complexity, leading to prohibitive latency. Existing acceleration methods face a fundamental trade-off: dynamically estimating sparse attention patterns at each denoising step incurs high computational overhead and estimation errors, while static sparsity patterns remain fixed and often suboptimal throughout denoising. We identify a key structural property of diffusion attention, namely, its sparsity patterns exhibit strong temporal coherence across denoising steps. Tiles deemed non-essential at step $t$ typically remain so at step $t+δ$. Leveraging this observation, we introduce LiteAttention, a method that exploits temporal coherence to enable evolutionary computation skips across the denoising sequence. By marking non-essential tiles early and propagating skip decisions forward, LiteAttention eliminates redundant attention computations without repeated profiling overheads, combining the adaptivity of dynamic methods with the efficiency of static ones. We implement a highly optimized LiteAttention kernel on top of FlashAttention and demonstrate substantial speedups on production video diffusion models, with no degradation in quality. The code and implementation details will be publicly released.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) remains a leading cause of preventable blindness, with early detection critical for reducing vision loss worldwide. Over the past decade, deep learning has transformed DR screening, progressing from early convolutional neural networks trained on private datasets to advanced pipelines addressing class imbalance, label scarcity, domain shift, and interpretability. This survey provides the first systematic synthesis of DR research spanning 2016-2025, consolidating results from 50+ studies and over 20 datasets. We critically examine methodological advances, including self- and semi-supervised learning, domain generalization, federated training, and hybrid neuro-symbolic models, alongside evaluation protocols, reporting standards, and reproducibility challenges. Benchmark tables contextualize performance across datasets, while discussion highlights open gaps in multi-center validation and clinical trust. By linking technical progress with translational barriers, this work outlines a practical agenda for reproducible, privacy-preserving, and clinically deployable DR AI. Beyond DR, many of the surveyed innovations extend broadly to medical imaging at scale.

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) aims to automatically generate diagnostic reports from radiology images. To achieve this, existing methods have leveraged the powerful cross-modal generation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), primarily focusing on optimizing cross-modal alignment between radiographs and reports through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, by only performing instance-level alignment with the image-text pairs, the standard SFT paradigm fails to establish anatomically-grounded alignment, where the templated nature of reports often leads to sub-optimal generation quality. To address this, we propose \textsc{S2D-Align}, a novel SFT paradigm that establishes anatomically-grounded alignment by leveraging auxiliary signals of varying granularities. \textsc{S2D-Align} implements a shallow-to-deep strategy, progressively enriching the alignment process: it begins with the coarse radiograph-report pairing, then introduces reference reports for instance-level guidance, and ultimately utilizes key phrases to ground the generation in specific anatomical details. To bridge the different alignment stages, we introduce a memory-based adapter that empowers feature sharing, thereby integrating coarse and fine-grained guidance. For evaluation, we conduct experiments on the public \textsc{MIMIC-CXR} and \textsc{IU X-Ray} benchmarks, where \textsc{S2D-Align} achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our multi-stage, auxiliary-guided approach, highlighting a promising direction for enhancing grounding capabilities in complex, multi-modal generation tasks.

Abstract: While generative models have seen significant adoption across a wide range of data modalities, including 3D data, a consensus on which model is best suited for which task has yet to be reached. Further, conditional information such as text and images to steer the generation process are frequently employed, whereas others, like partial 3D data, have not been thoroughly evaluated. In this work, we compare two of the most promising generative models--Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models and Autoregressive Causal Transformers--which we adapt for the tasks of generative shape modeling and completion. We conduct a thorough quantitative evaluation and comparison of both tasks, including a baseline discriminative model and an extensive ablation study. Our results show that (1) the diffusion model with continuous latents outperforms both the discriminative model and the autoregressive approach and delivers state-of-the-art performance on multi-modal shape completion from a single, noisy depth image under realistic conditions and (2) when compared on the same discrete latent space, the autoregressive model can match or exceed diffusion performance on these tasks.

Abstract: Estimating the geometric and volumetric properties of transparent deformable liquids is challenging due to optical complexities and dynamic surface deformations induced by container movements. Autonomous robots performing precise liquid manipulation tasks, such as dispensing, aspiration, and mixing, must handle containers in ways that inevitably induce these deformations, complicating accurate liquid state assessment. Current datasets lack comprehensive physics-informed simulation data representing realistic liquid behaviors under diverse dynamic scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Phys-Liquid, a physics-informed dataset comprising 97,200 simulation images and corresponding 3D meshes, capturing liquid dynamics across multiple laboratory scenes, lighting conditions, liquid colors, and container rotations. To validate the realism and effectiveness of Phys-Liquid, we propose a four-stage reconstruction and estimation pipeline involving liquid segmentation, multi-view mask generation, 3D mesh reconstruction, and real-world scaling. Experimental results demonstrate improved accuracy and consistency in reconstructing liquid geometry and volume, outperforming existing benchmarks. The dataset and associated validation methods facilitate future advancements in transparent liquid perception tasks.

Abstract: Meteorological agencies around the world rely on real-time flood guidance to issue live-saving advisories and warnings. For decades traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have been state-of-the-art for precipitation forecasting. However, physically-parameterized models suffer from a few core limitations: first, solving PDEs to resolve atmospheric dynamics is computationally demanding, and second, these methods degrade in performance at nowcasting timescales (i.e., 0-4 hour lead-times). Motivated by these shortcomings, recent work proposes AI-weather prediction (AI-WP) alternatives that learn to emulate analysis data with neural networks. While these data-driven approaches have enjoyed enormous success across diverse spatial and temporal resolutions, applications of video-understanding architectures for weather forecasting remain underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose SaTformer: a video transformer built on full space-time attention that skillfully forecasts extreme precipitation from satellite radiances. Along with our novel architecture, we introduce techniques to tame long-tailed precipitation datasets. Namely, we reformulate precipitation regression into a classification problem, and employ a class-weighted loss to address label imbalances. Our model scored first place on the NeurIPS Weather4Cast 2025 Cumulative Rainfall challenge. Code and model weights are available: https://github.com/leharris3/satformer

TL;DR: 本研究首次系统评估了数字重建X光片（DRRs）作为冠状动脉钙化检测的替代训练域，通过生成合成DRRs并评估多种训练策略，证明了DRRs可作为可扩展、标签丰富的冠状动脉钙化检测基础。

Conclusion: DRRs为冠状动脉钙化检测提供了可扩展、标签丰富的基础，并为未来向真实胸部X光的迁移学习和域适应奠定了基础。

Abstract: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events, with CT-based Agatston scoring widely regarded as the clinical gold standard. However, CT is costly and impractical for large-scale screening, while chest X-rays (CXRs) are inexpensive but lack reliable ground truth labels, constraining deep learning development. Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) offer a scalable alternative by projecting CT volumes into CXR-like images while inheriting precise labels. In this work, we provide the first systematic evaluation of DRRs as a surrogate training domain for CAC detection. Using 667 CT scans from the COCA dataset, we generate synthetic DRRs and assess model capacity, super-resolution fidelity enhancement, preprocessing, and training strategies. Lightweight CNNs trained from scratch outperform large pretrained networks; pairing super-resolution with contrast enhancement yields significant gains; and curriculum learning stabilises training under weak supervision. Our best configuration achieves a mean AUC of 0.754, comparable to or exceeding prior CXR-based studies. These results establish DRRs as a scalable, label-rich foundation for CAC detection, while laying the foundation for future transfer learning and domain adaptation to real CXRs.

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), a two-stage framework consisting of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results on improving reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs). Yet extending RFT to large video language models (LVLMs) remains challenging. We propose VideoP2R, a novel process-aware video RFT framework that enhances video reasoning by modeling perception and reasoning as distinct processes. In the SFT stage, we develop a three-step pipeline to generate VideoP2R-CoT-162K, a high-quality, process-aware chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for perception and reasoning. In the RL stage, we introduce a novel process-aware group relative policy optimization (PA-GRPO) algorithm that supplies separate rewards for perception and reasoning. Extensive experiments show that VideoP2R achieves state-of-the-art (SotA) performance on six out of seven video reasoning and understanding benchmarks. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our process-aware modeling and PA-GRPO and demonstrate that model's perception output is information-sufficient for downstream reasoning.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) in media has advanced rapidly over the last decade. The introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) improved the quality of photorealistic image generation. Diffusion models later brought a new era of generative media. These advances made it difficult to separate real and synthetic content. The rise of deepfakes demonstrated how these tools could be misused to spread misinformation, political conspiracies, privacy violations, and fraud. For this reason, many detection models have been developed. They often use deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). These models search for visual, spatial, or temporal anomalies. However, such approaches often fail to generalize across unseen data and struggle with content from different models. In addition, existing approaches are ineffective in multimodal data and highly modified content. This study reviews twenty-four recent works on AI-generated media detection. Each study was examined individually to identify its contributions and weaknesses, respectively. The review then summarizes the common limitations and key challenges faced by current approaches. Based on this analysis, a research direction is suggested with a focus on multimodal deep learning models. Such models have the potential to provide more robust and generalized detection. It offers future researchers a clear starting point for building stronger defenses against harmful synthetic media.

Abstract: Vectorized glyphs are widely used in poster design, network animation, art display, and various other fields due to their scalability and flexibility. In typography, they are often seen as special sequences composed of ordered strokes. This concept extends to the token sequence prediction abilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling vectorized character generation through stroke modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel Large Vectorized Glyph Model (LVGM) designed to generate vectorized Chinese glyphs by predicting the next stroke. Initially, we encode strokes into discrete latent variables called stroke embeddings. Subsequently, we train our LVGM via fine-tuning DeepSeek LLM by predicting the next stroke embedding. With limited strokes given, it can generate complete characters, semantically elegant words, and even unseen verses in vectorized form. Moreover, we release a new large-scale Chinese SVG dataset containing 907,267 samples based on strokes for dynamically vectorized glyph generation. Experimental results show that our model has scaling behaviors on data scales. Our generated vectorized glyphs have been validated by experts and relevant individuals.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Hindsight Distilled Reasoning (HinD)框架和Knowledge Encouragement Preference Optimization (KEPO)方法，旨在激发多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)的内部知识推理能力，解决知识型视觉问答(KBVQA)中推理过程不明确的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KBVQA方法要么通过上下文学习利用MLLMs的隐式知识，要么通过检索增强生成利用显式知识，但它们的推理过程仍然隐含，缺乏MLLMs的明确多步推理轨迹。

Method: 1. 提出HinD框架：通过提示冻结的7B规模MLLM完成问题与真实答案之间的推理过程，构建Hindsight-Zero训练数据；2. 将Hindsight-Zero自蒸馏为思维链生成器和知识生成器；3. 使用KEPO优化知识生成器，偏好低置信度但有用的知识而非高置信度但无用的知识。

Conclusion: HinD框架成功激发了MLLMs的内部知识推理能力，通过显式推理轨迹和知识偏好优化，在KBVQA任务中取得了优异表现，为MLLMs的知识推理能力开发提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KBVQA) necessitates external knowledge incorporation beyond cross-modal understanding. Existing KBVQA methods either utilize implicit knowledge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) via in-context learning or explicit knowledge via retrieval augmented generation. However, their reasoning processes remain implicit, without explicit multi-step trajectories from MLLMs. To address this gap, we provide a Hindsight Distilled Reasoning (HinD) framework with Knowledge Encouragement Preference Optimization (KEPO), designed to elicit and harness internal knowledge reasoning ability in MLLMs. First, to tackle the reasoning supervision problem, we propose to emphasize the hindsight wisdom of MLLM by prompting a frozen 7B-size MLLM to complete the reasoning process between the question and its ground truth answer, constructing Hindsight-Zero training data. Then we self-distill Hindsight-Zero into Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Generator and Knowledge Generator, enabling the generation of sequential steps and discrete facts. Secondly, to tackle the misalignment between knowledge correctness and confidence, we optimize the Knowledge Generator with KEPO, preferring under-confident but helpful knowledge over the over-confident but unhelpful one. The generated CoT and sampled knowledge are then exploited for answer prediction. Experiments on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA validate the effectiveness of HinD, showing that HinD with elicited reasoning from 7B-size MLLM achieves superior performance without commercial model APIs or outside knowledge.

Abstract: The Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridge (DDIB) is an emerging image-to-image (I2I) translation method that preserves cycle consistency while achieving strong flexibility. It links two independently trained diffusion models (DMs) in the source and target domains by first adding noise to a source image to obtain a latent code, then denoising it in the target domain to generate the translated image. However, this method faces two key challenges: (1) low translation efficiency, and (2) translation trajectory deviations caused by mismatched latent distributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel I2I translation framework, OT-ALD, grounded in optimal transport (OT) theory, which retains the strengths of DDIB-based approach. Specifically, we compute an OT map from the latent distribution of the source domain to that of the target domain, and use the mapped distribution as the starting point for the reverse diffusion process in the target domain. Our error analysis confirms that OT-ALD eliminates latent distribution mismatches. Moreover, OT-ALD effectively balances faster image translation with improved image quality. Experiments on four translation tasks across three high-resolution datasets show that OT-ALD improves sampling efficiency by 20.29% and reduces the FID score by 2.6 on average compared to the top-performing baseline models.

Abstract: Bridging the past to the future, connecting agents both spatially and temporally, lies at the core of the trajectory prediction task. Despite great efforts, it remains challenging to explicitly learn and predict latencies, the temporal delays with which agents respond to different trajectory-changing events and adjust their future paths, whether on their own or interactively. Different agents may exhibit distinct latency preferences for noticing, processing, and reacting to any specific trajectory-changing event. The lack of consideration of such latencies may undermine the causal continuity of the forecasting system and also lead to implausible or unintended trajectories. Inspired by the reverberation curves in acoustics, we propose a new reverberation transform and the corresponding Reverberation (short for Rev) trajectory prediction model, which simulates and predicts different latency preferences of each agent as well as their stochasticity by using two explicit and learnable reverberation kernels, allowing for the controllable trajectory prediction based on these forecasted latencies. Experiments on multiple datasets, whether pedestrians or vehicles, demonstrate that Rev achieves competitive accuracy while revealing interpretable latency dynamics across agents and scenarios. Qualitative analyses further verify the properties of the proposed reverberation transform, highlighting its potential as a general latency modeling approach.

### [41] [Explainable Deep Convolutional Multi-Type Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11165)
*Alex George,Lyudmila Mihaylova,Sean Anderson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiTypeFCDD是一个轻量级卷积框架，用于可解释的多类型异常检测，能够区分不同类型的异常，无需为每个对象类别训练单独模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释异常检测方法无法区分异常类型，且需要为每个对象类别训练和维护单独模型，这在实际应用中成本高昂。同时，现有大规模视觉语言模型虽然开始解决这个问题，但计算密集且内存占用大，不适合实时或嵌入式系统。

Method: 提出MultiTypeFCDD框架，仅使用图像级标签学习并生成多通道热图，每个通道对应特定异常类型。该模型作为单一统一框架，能够跨多个对象类别区分异常类型。

Result: 在Real-IAD数据集上的评估显示，该方法在显著减少参数负载和推理时间的情况下，与最先进复杂模型的结果具有竞争力。

Conclusion: MultiTypeFCDD是一个高度实用且可行的解决方案，特别适用于计算资源受限的实际应用场景。

Abstract: Most explainable anomaly detection methods often identify anomalies but lack the capability to differentiate the type of anomaly. Furthermore, they often require the costly training and maintenance of separate models for each object category. The lack of specificity is a significant research gap, as identifying the type of anomaly (e.g., "Crack" vs. "Scratch") is crucial for accurate diagnosis that facilitates cost-saving operational decisions across diverse application domains. While some recent large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have begun to address this, they are computationally intensive and memory-heavy, restricting their use in real-time or embedded systems. We propose MultiTypeFCDD, a simple and lightweight convolutional framework designed as a practical alternative for explainable multi-type anomaly detection. MultiTypeFCDD uses only image-level labels to learn and produce multi-channel heatmaps, where each channel is trained to correspond to a specific anomaly type. The model functions as a single, unified framework capable of differentiating anomaly types across multiple object categories, eliminating the need to train and manage separate models for each object category. We evaluated our proposed method on the Real-IAD dataset and it delivers results competitive with state-of-the-art complex models at significantly reduced parametric load and inference times. This makes it a highly practical and viable solution for real-world applications where computational resources are tightly constrained.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) cooperative perception has great potential to enhance autonomous driving performance by overcoming perception limitations in complex adverse traffic scenarios (CATS). Meanwhile, data serves as the fundamental infrastructure for modern autonomous driving AI. However, due to stringent data collection requirements, existing datasets focus primarily on ordinary traffic scenarios, constraining the benefits of cooperative perception. To address this challenge, we introduce CATS-V2V, the first-of-its-kind real-world dataset for V2V cooperative perception under complex adverse traffic scenarios. The dataset was collected by two hardware time-synchronized vehicles, covering 10 weather and lighting conditions across 10 diverse locations. The 100-clip dataset includes 60K frames of 10 Hz LiDAR point clouds and 1.26M multi-view 30 Hz camera images, along with 750K anonymized yet high-precision RTK-fixed GNSS and IMU records. Correspondingly, we provide time-consistent 3D bounding box annotations for objects, as well as static scenes to construct a 4D BEV representation. On this basis, we propose a target-based temporal alignment method, ensuring that all objects are precisely aligned across all sensor modalities. We hope that CATS-V2V, the largest-scale, most supportive, and highest-quality dataset of its kind to date, will benefit the autonomous driving community in related tasks.

Conclusion: AlignVQA框架通过多智能体辩论和校准感知损失函数，有效提升了视觉问答系统的置信度校准性能，使其置信度估计更准确地反映实际预测性能。

Abstract: In the context of Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Agentic AI, calibration refers to how closely an AI system's confidence in its answers reflects their actual correctness. This aspect becomes especially important when such systems operate autonomously and must make decisions under visual uncertainty. While modern VQA systems, powered by advanced vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used in high-stakes domains like medical diagnostics and autonomous navigation due to their improved accuracy, the reliability of their confidence estimates remains under-examined. Particularly, these systems often produce overconfident responses. To address this, we introduce AlignVQA, a debate-based multi-agent framework, in which diverse specialized VLM -- each following distinct prompting strategies -- generate candidate answers and then engage in two-stage interaction: generalist agents critique, refine and aggregate these proposals. This debate process yields confidence estimates that more accurately reflect the model's true predictive performance. We find that more calibrated specialized agents produce better aligned confidences. Furthermore, we introduce a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss function called aligncal designed to fine-tune the specialized agents by minimizing an upper bound on the calibration error. This objective explicitly improves the fidelity of each agent's confidence estimates. Empirical results across multiple benchmark VQA datasets substantiate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating substantial reductions in calibration discrepancies. Furthermore, we propose a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss to fine-tune the specialized agents and improve the quality of their individual confidence estimates based on minimising upper bound calibration error.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中多视角视频常因相机触发延迟或独立录制设置导致时序不同步，而现有4D高斯溅射方法假设输入视频流时序同步，这限制了其在实际应用中的效果。

Method: 采用粗到精对齐模块，先估计帧级粗偏移，再细化到亚帧精度，可作为即插即用模块集成到现有4DGS框架中。

Result: 实验表明该方法能有效处理时序错位视频，显著提升基线方法的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的时序对齐策略增强了4DGS处理异步数据的鲁棒性，为实际应用中的多视角视频重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-view video reconstruction plays a vital role in computer vision, enabling applications in film production, virtual reality, and motion analysis. While recent advances such as 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in dynamic scene reconstruction, they typically rely on the assumption that input video streams are temporally synchronized. However, in real-world scenarios, this assumption often fails due to factors like camera trigger delays or independent recording setups, leading to temporal misalignment across views and reduced reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, a novel temporal alignment strategy is proposed for high-quality 4DGS reconstruction from unsynchronized multi-view videos. Our method features a coarse-to-fine alignment module that estimates and compensates for each camera's time shift. The method first determines a coarse, frame-level offset and then refines it to achieve sub-frame accuracy. This strategy can be integrated as a readily integrable module into existing 4DGS frameworks, enhancing their robustness when handling asynchronous data. Experiments show that our approach effectively processes temporally misaligned videos and significantly enhances baseline methods.

Conclusion: Viper-F1通过高效的状态空间方法和视觉定位增强，在保持性能的同时大幅降低了计算成本，适用于资源受限的实际应用场景。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled impressive progress in vision-language understanding, yet their high computational cost limits deployment in resource-constrained scenarios such as robotic manipulation, personal assistants, and smart cameras. Most existing methods rely on Transformer-based cross-attention, whose quadratic complexity hinders efficiency. Moreover, small vision-language models often struggle to precisely capture fine-grained, task-relevant visual regions, leading to degraded performance on fine-grained reasoning tasks that limit their effectiveness in the real world. To address these issues, we introduce Viper-F1, a Hybrid State-Space Vision-Language Model that replaces attention with efficient Liquid State-Space Dynamics. To further enhance visual grounding, we propose a Token-Grid Correlation Module, which computes lightweight correlations between text tokens and image patches and modulates the state-space dynamics via FiLM conditioning. This enables the model to selectively emphasize visual regions relevant to the textual prompt while maintaining linear-time inference. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Viper-F1 achieves accurate, fine-grained understanding with significantly improved efficiency.

Abstract: This paper is a submission for the Weather4Cast~2025 complementary Pollution Task and presents an efficient framework for 6-hour lead-time nowcasting of PM$_1$, PM$_{2.5}$, and PM$_{10}$ across the Indian subcontinent and surrounding regions. The proposed approach leverages analysis fields from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) Global Atmospheric Composition Forecasts at 0.4 degree resolution. A 256x256 spatial region, covering 28.4S-73.6N and 32E-134.0E, is used as the model input, while predictions are generated for the central 128x128 area spanning 2.8S-48N and 57.6E-108.4E, ensuring an India-centric forecast domain with sufficient synoptic-scale context. Models are trained on CAMS analyses from 2021-2023 using a shuffled 90/10 split and independently evaluated on 2024 data. Three lightweight parameter-specific architectures are developed to improve accuracy, minimize systematic bias, and enable rapid inference. Evaluation using RMSE, MAE, Bias, and SSIM demonstrates substantial performance gains over the Aurora foundation model, underscoring the effectiveness of compact & specialized deep learning models for short-range forecasts on limited spatial domains.

Abstract: This study presents a transfer-learning framework based on Convolutional Gated Recurrent Units (ConvGRU) for short-term rainfall prediction in the Weather4Cast 2025 competition. A single SEVIRI infrared channel (10.8 μm wavelength) is used as input, which consists of four observations over a one-hour period. A two-stage training strategy is applied to generate rainfall estimates up to four hours ahead. In the first stage, ConvGRU is trained to forecast the brightness temperatures from SEVIRI, enabling the model to capture relevant spatiotemporal patterns. In the second stage, an empirically derived nonlinear transformation maps the predicted fields to OPERA-compatible rainfall rates.
  For the event-prediction task, the transformed rainfall forecasts are processed using 3D event detection followed by spatiotemporal feature extraction to identify and characterize precipitation events. Our submission achieved 2nd place in the cumulative rainfall task. Further, the same model was used out-of-the-box for the event prediction task, and resulted in similar scores as the baseline model to the competition.

Abstract: Geospatial chain of thought (CoT) reasoning is essential for advancing Visual Question Answering (VQA) on satellite imagery, particularly in climate related applications such as disaster monitoring, infrastructure risk assessment, urban resilience planning, and policy support. Existing VQA models enable scalable interpretation of remote sensing data but often lack the structured reasoning required for complex geospatial queries. We propose a VQA framework that integrates CoT reasoning with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to improve interpretability, robustness, and accuracy. By generating intermediate rationales, the model better handles tasks involving detection, classification, spatial relations, and comparative analysis, which are critical for reliable decision support in high stakes climate domains. Experiments show that CoT supervision improves accuracy by 34.9\% over direct baselines, while DPO yields additional gains in accuracy and reasoning quality. The resulting system advances VQA for multispectral Earth observation by enabling richer geospatial reasoning and more effective climate use cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型取得了显著进展，但其在保持语义不变的小规模输入变化下的可靠性尚未得到充分研究，需要系统评估模型对良性扰动的鲁棒性。

Method: 通过大规模实验，评估多种VLMs对像素级偏移、几何变换、缩放填充、文本改写和多语言重写等不改变语义的扰动的敏感性。

Result: 现代VLMs对微小扰动高度敏感，大量样本在至少一种视觉或文本修改下会改变预测答案；稳定性与正确性高度相关，稳定样本更可能被正确回答。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs存在根本性脆弱性，需要超越对抗性扰动的鲁棒性评估，重点关注模型应可靠保持的不变性。

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their reliability under small, meaning-preserving input changes remains poorly understood. We present the first large-scale, systematic study of VLM robustness to benign visual and textual perturbations: pixel-level shifts, light geometric transformations, padded rescaling, paraphrasing, and multilingual rewrites that do not alter the underlying semantics of an image-question pair. Across a broad set of models and datasets, we find that modern VLMs are highly sensitive to such minor perturbations: a substantial fraction of samples change their predicted answer under at least one visual or textual modification. We characterize how this instability varies across perturbation types, question categories, and models, revealing that even state-of-the-art systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash) frequently fail under shifts as small as a few pixels or harmless rephrasings. We further show that sample-level stability serves as a strong indicator of correctness: stable samples are consistently far more likely to be answered correctly. Leveraging this, we demonstrate that the stability patterns of small, accessible open-source models can be used to predict the correctness of much larger closed-source models with high precision. Our findings expose a fundamental fragility in current VLMs and highlight the need for robustness evaluations that go beyond adversarial perturbations, focusing instead on invariances that models should reliably uphold.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks represent a critical threat to deep learning systems, particularly in safety-sensitive 3D domains such as autonomous driving and robotics. However, existing backdoor attacks for 3D point clouds have been limited to a rigid one-to-one paradigm. To address this, we present the first one-to-N backdoor framework for 3D vision, based on a novel, configurable spherical trigger. Our key insight is to leverage the spatial properties of spheres as a parameter space, allowing a single trigger design to encode multiple target classes. We establish a theoretical foundation for one-to-N backdoor attacks in 3D, demonstrating that poisoned models can map distinct trigger configurations to different target labels. Experimental results systematically validate this conclusion across multiple datasets and model architectures, achieving high attack success rates (up to 100\%) while maintaining accuracy on clean data. This work establishes a crucial benchmark for multi-target threats in 3D vision and provides the foundational understanding needed to secure future 3D-driven intelligent systems.

Conclusion: 配备模块化组件的基础模型能够超越初始训练范围，发展为医学成像的多任务多模态系统。

Abstract: Foundational models are trained on extensive datasets to capture the general trends of a domain. However, in medical imaging, the scarcity of data makes pre-training for every domain, modality, or task challenging. Instead of building separate models, we propose MAFM^3 (Modular Adaptation of Foundation Models for Multi-Modal Medical AI), a framework that enables a single foundation model to expand into diverse domains, tasks, and modalities through lightweight modular components. These components serve as specialized skill sets that allow the system to flexibly activate the appropriate capability at the inference time, depending on the input type or clinical objective. Unlike conventional adaptation methods that treat each new task or modality in isolation, MAFM^3 provides a unified and expandable framework for efficient multitask and multimodality adaptation. Empirically, we validate our approach by adapting a chest CT foundation model initially trained for classification into prognosis and segmentation modules. Our results show improved performance on both tasks. Furthermore, by incorporating PET scans, MAFM^3 achieved an improvement in the Dice score 5% compared to the respective baselines. These findings establish that foundation models, when equipped with modular components, are not inherently constrained to their initial training scope but can evolve into multitask, multimodality systems for medical imaging.

Conclusion: GSD框架成功利用视频扩散模型的多视图一致性先验，有效解决了3D高斯泼溅在稀疏视图下的过拟合问题，通过深度和语义引导确保了正确的相机姿态和几何精度。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained great attention in the 3D scene representation for its high-quality real-time rendering capabilities. However, when the input comprises sparse training views, 3DGS is prone to overfitting, primarily due to the lack of intermediate-view supervision. Inspired by the recent success of Video Diffusion Models (VDM), we propose a framework called Guidance Score Distillation (GSD) to extract the rich multi-view consistency priors from pretrained VDMs. Building on the insights from Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), GSD supervises rendered images from multiple neighboring views, guiding the Gaussian splatting representation towards the generative direction of VDM. However, the generative direction often involves object motion and random camera trajectories, making it challenging for direct supervision in the optimization process. To address this problem, we introduce an unified guidance form to correct the noise prediction result of VDM. Specifically, we incorporate both a depth warp guidance based on real depth maps and a guidance based on semantic image features, ensuring that the score update direction from VDM aligns with the correct camera pose and accurate geometry. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches across multiple datasets.

Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型主要关注图像块与语言token的对齐，但图像块对人类视觉无意义，单个token也不一定携带可接地信息。需要将token分组来描述场景的不同方面。

Method: 提出一种在架构中自动将caption tokens分组的模型，使语言表示达到图像中对象的粒度级别，并与经过训练发现对象的图像编码器输出进行对齐。

Conclusion: 通过token分组的方法能够有效提升视觉语言模型的细粒度理解能力，所发现的token组与真实世界中的可接地概念高度一致。

Abstract: Fine-grained knowledge is crucial for vision-language models to obtain a better understanding of the real world. While there has been work trying to acquire this kind of knowledge in the space of vision and language, it has mostly focused on aligning the image patches with the tokens on the language side. However, image patches do not have any meaning to the human eye, and individual tokens do not necessarily carry groundable information in the image. It is groups of tokens which describe different aspects of the scene. In this work, we propose a model which groups the caption tokens as part of its architecture in order to capture a fine-grained representation of the language. We expect our representations to be at the level of objects present in the image, and therefore align our representations with the output of an image encoder trained to discover objects. We show that by learning to group the tokens, the vision-language model has a better fine-grained understanding of vision and language. In addition, the token groups that our model discovers are highly similar to groundable phrases in text, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: 多模态模型中的位置偏见由位置编码方案、训练损失、上下文重要性以及图像-文本对的使用性质等多种因素共同导致或放大。

Abstract: Positional bias - where models overemphasize certain positions regardless of content - has been shown to negatively impact model performance across various tasks. While recent research has extensively examined positional bias in text generation models, its presence and effects in representation models remain underexplored. Even less is known about such biases in multimodal models. In this work, we investigate positional bias in multimodal representation models, specifically in the context of image-text retrieval. We begin by distinguishing between context importance and positional bias, and then assess the presence and extent of positional bias across different models and datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that positional bias is prevalent in multimodal models, but manifests differently across modalities: text encoders tend to exhibit bias toward the beginning of the input, whereas image encoders show bias at both the beginning and end. Furthermore, we find that this bias arises from, or is amplified by, a combination of factors, including the positional encoding scheme, training loss, context importance, and the nature of using image-text pairs in multimodal training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉语言模型微调过程中存在偏见、错误和分布不平衡问题，导致过拟合和性能不均衡。现有合成数据方法缺乏对分布偏见和标注质量的控制。

Method: 重新设计微调过程：1) 控制数据和标注生成，确保无偏见、分布平衡和无标注错误；2) 自动构建数据集，全面采样物体属性（颜色、形状、大小、位置）；3) 使用该数据集微调最先进的视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: 通过控制合成数据生成过程可以解决传统微调中的偏见和分布不平衡问题，显著提升模型在真实世界数据上的性能表现。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is a common strategy to improve performance following an ad-hoc data collection and annotation of real-world scenes. However, this process is often prone to biases, errors, and distribution imbalance, resulting in overfitting and imbalanced performance. Although a few studies have tried to address this problem by generating synthetic data, they lacked control over distribution bias and annotation quality. To address these challenges, we redesign the fine-tuning process in two ways. First, we control the generation of data and its annotations, ensuring it is free from bias, distribution imbalance, and annotation errors. We automatically construct the dataset by comprehensively sampling objects' attributes, including color, shape, size, and position within the scene. Secondly, using this annotated dataset, we fine-tune state-of-the-art VLMs and assess performance transferability to real-world data on the absolute position task. We conduct exhaustive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: 1) fine-tuning on balanced synthetic data yields uniform performance across the visual scene and mitigates common biases; and 2) fine-tuning on synthetic stimuli significantly improves performance on real-world data (COCO), outperforming models fine-tuned in the matched setting.

TL;DR: DiT-Gaze是一个基于扩散变换器的高保真视线重定向框架，通过弱监督和正交约束损失提升3D视线重定向模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D高斯溅射模型在渲染细微连续视线变化时存在困难，需要更高保真度的视线重定向方法来生成增强数据以改进视线估计器的泛化能力。

Method: 结合扩散变换器(DiT)、跨视线角度的弱监督策略和正交约束损失。DiT实现更高保真度的图像合成，弱监督使用合成的中间视线角度提供平滑的视线方向流形，正交约束损失数学上强制视线、头部姿态和表情的内部表示解耦。

Conclusion: DiT-Gaze为创建合成训练数据提供了一种优越的方法，代码和模型将向研究社区开放用于基准测试。

Abstract: High-fidelity gaze redirection is critical for generating augmented data to improve the generalization of gaze estimators. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models like GazeGaussian represent the state-of-the-art but can struggle with rendering subtle, continuous gaze shifts. In this paper, we propose DiT-Gaze, a framework that enhances 3D gaze redirection models using a novel combination of Diffusion Transformer (DiT), weak supervision across gaze angles, and an orthogonality constraint loss. DiT allows higher-fidelity image synthesis, while our weak supervision strategy using synthetically generated intermediate gaze angles provides a smooth manifold of gaze directions during training. The orthogonality constraint loss mathematically enforces the disentanglement of internal representations for gaze, head pose, and expression. Comprehensive experiments show that DiT-Gaze sets a new state-of-the-art in both perceptual quality and redirection accuracy, reducing the state-of-the-art gaze error by 4.1% to 6.353 degrees, providing a superior method for creating synthetic training data. Our code and models will be made available for the research community to benchmark against.

TL;DR: DoReMi是一个混合专家框架，通过联合建模域感知专家分支和统一表示分支，解决多源点云数据异构性导致的负迁移问题，在多个3D理解基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D深度学习在多域泛化方面受限，主要原因是数据集规模有限和多源点云的高度异构性。不同传感器采集的点云在密度和噪声分布上存在显著差异，导致多域融合时出现负迁移。现有方法要么只关注域感知特征，要么只关注域通用特征，忽略了二者之间的协同潜力。

Method: 提出DoReMi框架，包含域感知专家分支和统一表示分支。通过域引导空间路由动态激活域感知专家分支，使用熵控制动态分配实现稳定高效的专家利用。统一表示分支通过鲁棒多属性自监督学习预训练并保持冻结，保留跨域几何和结构先验。

Result: 在多个3D理解基准测试中评估DoReMi，在ScanNet Val上达到80.1% mIoU，在S3DIS上达到77.2% mIoU，表现出与现有方法相当或更优的性能。

Conclusion: DoReMi展示了作为未来3D理解研究基础框架的强大潜力，能够自适应地建模多样域分布，同时保持全局一致性。

Abstract: The generalization of 3D deep learning across multiple domains remains limited by the limited scale of existing datasets and the high heterogeneity of multi-source point clouds. Point clouds collected from different sensors (e.g., LiDAR scans and mesh-derived point clouds) exhibit substantial discrepancies in density and noise distribution, resulting in negative transfer during multi-domain fusion. Most existing approaches focus exclusively on either domain-aware or domain-general features, overlooking the potential synergy between them. To address this, we propose DoReMi (Domain-Representation Mixture), a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that jointly models Domain-aware Experts branch and a unified Representation branch to enable cooperative learning between specialized and generalizable knowledge. DoReMi dynamically activates domain-aware expert branch via Domain-Guided Spatial Routing (DSR) for context-aware expert selection and employs Entropy-Controlled Dynamic Allocation (EDA) for stable and efficient expert utilization, thereby adaptively modeling diverse domain distributions. Complemented by a frozen unified representation branch pretrained through robust multi-attribute self-supervised learning, DoReMi preserves cross-domain geometric and structural priors while maintaining global consistency. We evaluate DoReMi across multiple 3D understanding benchmarks. Notably, DoReMi achieves 80.1% mIoU on ScanNet Val and 77.2% mIoU on S3DIS, demonstrating competitive or superior performance compared to existing approaches, and showing strong potential as a foundation framework for future 3D understanding research. The code will be released soon.

Conclusion: 提出的MoE LoRA框架能够有效解决少样本风格编辑问题，在参数效率和性能方面都表现出色。

Abstract: In recent years, image editing has garnered growing attention. However, general image editing models often fail to produce satisfactory results when confronted with new styles. The challenge lies in how to effectively fine-tune general image editing models to new styles using only a limited amount of paired data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel few-shot style editing framework. For this task, we construct a benchmark dataset that encompasses five distinct styles. Correspondingly, we propose a parameter-efficient multi-style Mixture-of-Experts Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE LoRA) with style-specific and style-shared routing mechanisms for jointly fine-tuning multiple styles. The style-specific routing ensures that different styles do not interfere with one another, while the style-shared routing adaptively allocates shared MoE LoRAs to learn common patterns. Our MoE LoRA can automatically determine the optimal ranks for each layer through a novel metric-guided approach that estimates the importance score of each single-rank component. Additionally, we explore the optimal location to insert LoRA within the Diffusion in Transformer (DiT) model and integrate adversarial learning and flow matching to guide the diffusion training process. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches with significantly fewer LoRA parameters.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在3D空间智能理解方面存在双重瓶颈：输入阶段的几何感知编码器计算成本高与2D特征浅层化的冲突，以及输出阶段离散标记器无法生成精确连续数值的问题。

Method: 引入GEODE架构，包含两个专门模块：解耦推理模块（DRM）作为空间协处理器，通过交叉注意力对齐3D数据和2D视觉特征；直接回归头（DRH）采用"嵌入即值"范式，通过轻量MLP精确回归标量和3D边界框。

Conclusion: GEODE通过解耦3D推理和数值生成的双模块架构，有效解决了视觉语言模型在3D空间理解方面的根本瓶颈，在较小参数规模下实现了卓越的空间推理能力。

Abstract: Existing Vision Language Models (VLMs) architecturally rooted in "flatland" perception, fundamentally struggle to comprehend real-world 3D spatial intelligence. This failure stems from a dual-bottleneck: input-stage conflict between computationally exorbitant geometric-aware encoders and superficial 2D-only features, and output-stage misalignment where discrete tokenizers are structurally incapable of producing precise, continuous numerical values. To break this impasse, we introduce GEODE (Geometric-Output and Decoupled-Input Engine), a novel architecture that resolves this dual-bottleneck by decoupling 3D reasoning from numerical generation. GEODE augments main VLM with two specialized, plug-and-play modules: Decoupled Rationale Module (DRM) that acts as spatial co-processor, aligning explicit 3D data with 2D visual features via cross-attention and distilling spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) logic into injectable Rationale Tokens; and Direct Regression Head (DRH), an "Embedding-as-Value" paradigm which routes specialized control tokens to a lightweight MLP for precise, continuous regression of scalars and 3D bounding boxes. The synergy of these modules allows our 1.5B parameter model to function as a high-level semantic dispatcher, achieving state-of-the-art spatial reasoning performance that rivals 7B+ models.

Abstract: The automatic detection of gaze targets in autistic children through artificial intelligence can be impactful, especially for those who lack access to a sufficient number of professionals to improve their quality of life. This paper introduces a new, real-world AI application for gaze target detection in autistic children, which predicts a child's point of gaze from an activity image. This task is foundational for building automated systems that can measure joint attention-a core challenge in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). To facilitate the study of this challenging application, we collected the first-ever Autism Gaze Target (AGT) dataset. We further propose a novel Socially Aware Coarse-to-Fine (SACF) gaze detection framework that explicitly leverages the social context of a scene to overcome the class imbalance common in autism datasets-a consequence of autistic children's tendency to show reduced gaze to faces. It utilizes a two-pathway architecture with expert models specialized in social and non-social gaze, guided by a context-awareness gate module. The results of our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance for gaze target detection in this population, significantly outperforming existing methods, especially on the critical minority class of face-directed gaze.

TL;DR: CountSteer是一种无需训练的方法，通过引导扩散模型在推理过程中的交叉注意力隐藏状态，提高文本到图像生成中对象数量控制的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型虽然能生成逼真连贯的图像，但往往无法准确遵循文本中的数字指令，这揭示了语言和视觉表示之间的差距。研究发现这些模型并非完全对数字不敏感，它们隐式地意识到自己的计数准确性。

Method: 基于模型内部已经编码了数值正确性的潜在概念这一发现，提出了CountSteer方法，在推理过程中引导模型的交叉注意力隐藏状态，无需额外训练。

Result: 实验表明，CountSteer将对象计数准确性提高了约4%，且不损害视觉质量。

Conclusion: CountSteer是朝着更可控和语义可靠的文本到图像生成迈出的简单而有效的一步。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models generate realistic and coherent images but often fail to follow numerical instructions in text, revealing a gap between language and visual representation. Interestingly, we found that these models are not entirely blind to numbers-they are implicitly aware of their own counting accuracy, as their internal signals shift in consistent ways depending on whether the output meets the specified count. This observation suggests that the model already encodes a latent notion of numerical correctness, which can be harnessed to guide generation more precisely. Building on this intuition, we introduce CountSteer, a training-free method that improves generation of specified object counts by steering the model's cross-attention hidden states during inference. In our experiments, CountSteer improved object-count accuracy by about 4% without compromising visual quality, demonstrating a simple yet effective step toward more controllable and semantically reliable text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Vision-language models have recently emerged as promising planners for autonomous driving, where success hinges on topology-aware reasoning over spatial structure and dynamic interactions from multimodal input. However, existing models are typically trained without supervision that explicitly encodes these relational dependencies, limiting their ability to infer how agents and other traffic entities influence one another from raw sensor data. In this work, we bridge this gap with a novel model-agnostic method that conditions language-based driving models on structured relational context in the form of traffic scene graphs. We serialize scene graphs at various abstraction levels and formats, and incorporate them into the models via structured prompt templates, enabling a systematic analysis of when and how relational supervision is most beneficial. Extensive evaluations on the public LangAuto benchmark show that scene graph conditioning of state-of-the-art approaches yields large and persistent improvement in driving performance. Notably, we observe up to a 15.6\% increase in driving score for LMDrive and 17.5\% for BEVDriver, indicating that models can better internalize and ground relational priors through scene graph-conditioned training, even without requiring scene graph input at test-time. Code, fine-tuned models, and our scene graph dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/iis-esslingen/GraphPilot.

Abstract: Volumetric medical image segmentation presents unique challenges due to the inherent anatomical structure and limited availability of annotations. While recent methods have shown promise by contrasting spatial relationships between slices, they rely on hard binary thresholds to define positive and negative samples, thereby discarding valuable continuous information about anatomical similarity. Moreover, these methods overlook the global directional consistency of anatomical progression, resulting in distorted feature spaces that fail to capture the canonical anatomical manifold shared across patients. To address these limitations, we propose Coordinative Ordinal-Relational Anatomical Learning (CORAL) to capture both local and global structure in volumetric images. First, CORAL employs a contrastive ranking objective to leverage continuous anatomical similarity, ensuring relational feature distances between slices are proportional to their anatomical position differences. In addition, CORAL incorporates an ordinal objective to enforce global directional consistency, aligning the learned feature distribution with the canonical anatomical progression across patients. Learning these inter-slice relationships produces anatomically informed representations that benefit the downstream segmentation task. Through this coordinative learning framework, CORAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets under limited-annotation settings while learning representations with meaningful anatomical structure. Code is available at https://github.com/haoyiwang25/CORAL.

Abstract: Gaze redirection methods aim to generate realistic human face images with controllable eye movement. However, recent methods often struggle with 3D consistency, efficiency, or quality, limiting their practical applications. In this work, we propose RTGaze, a real-time and high-quality gaze redirection method. Our approach learns a gaze-controllable facial representation from face images and gaze prompts, then decodes this representation via neural rendering for gaze redirection. Additionally, we distill face geometric priors from a pretrained 3D portrait generator to enhance generation quality. We evaluate RTGaze both qualitatively and quantitatively, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in efficiency, redirection accuracy, and image quality across multiple datasets. Our system achieves real-time, 3D-aware gaze redirection with a feedforward network (~0.06 sec/image), making it 800x faster than the previous state-of-the-art 3D-aware methods.

Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) has created a pressing need for robust image watermarking that can withstand both conventional signal processing and novel semantic editing attacks. Current deep learning-based methods rely on training with hand-crafted noise simulation layers, which inherently limit their generalization to unforeseen distortions. In this work, we propose $\textbf{SimuFreeMark}$, a noise-$\underline{\text{simu}}$lation-$\underline{\text{free}}$ water$\underline{\text{mark}}$ing framework that circumvents this limitation by exploiting the inherent stability of image low-frequency components. We first systematically establish that low-frequency components exhibit significant robustness against a wide range of attacks. Building on this foundation, SimuFreeMark embeds watermarks directly into the deep feature space of the low-frequency components, leveraging a pre-trained variational autoencoder (VAE) to bind the watermark with structurally stable image representations. This design completely eliminates the need for noise simulation during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimuFreeMark outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a wide range of conventional and semantic attacks, while maintaining superior visual quality.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve impressive performance once optimized on massive datasets. Such datasets often contain sensitive or copyrighted content, raising significant data privacy concerns. Regulatory frameworks mandating the 'right to be forgotten' drive the need for machine unlearning. This technique allows for the removal of target data without resource-consuming retraining. However, while well-studied for text, visual concept unlearning in MLLMs remains underexplored. A primary challenge is precisely removing a target visual concept without disrupting model performance on related entities. To address this, we introduce AUVIC, a novel visual concept unlearning framework for MLLMs. AUVIC applies adversarial perturbations to enable precise forgetting. This approach effectively isolates the target concept while avoiding unintended effects on similar entities. To evaluate our method, we construct VCUBench. It is the first benchmark designed to assess visual concept unlearning in group contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that AUVIC achieves state-of-the-art target forgetting rates while incurs minimal performance degradation on non-target concepts.

Abstract: Automated and selective harvesting of fruits has become an important area of research, particularly due to challenges such as high costs and a shortage of seasonal labor in advanced economies. This paper focuses on 6D pose estimation of strawberries using purely synthetic data generated through a procedural pipeline for photorealistic rendering. We employ the YOLOX-6D-Pose algorithm, a single-shot approach that leverages the YOLOX backbone, known for its balance between speed and accuracy, and its support for edge inference. To address the lacking availability of training data, we introduce a robust and flexible pipeline for generating synthetic strawberry data from various 3D models via a procedural Blender pipeline, where we focus on enhancing the realism of the synthesized data in comparison to previous work to make it a valuable resource for training pose estimation algorithms. Quantitative evaluations indicate that our models achieve comparable accuracy on both the NVIDIA RTX 3090 and Jetson Orin Nano across several ADD-S metrics, with the RTX 3090 demonstrating superior processing speed. However, the Jetson Orin Nano is particularly suited for resource-constrained environments, making it an excellent choice for deployment in agricultural robotics. Qualitative assessments further confirm the model's performance, demonstrating its capability to accurately infer the poses of ripe and partially ripe strawberries, while facing challenges in detecting unripe specimens. This suggests opportunities for future improvements, especially in enhancing detection capabilities for unripe strawberries (if desired) by exploring variations in color. Furthermore, the methodology presented could be adapted easily for other fruits such as apples, peaches, and plums, thereby expanding its applicability and impact in the field of agricultural automation.

TL;DR: DocSLM是一种高效的小型视觉语言模型，专为内存受限环境下的长文档理解设计，通过分层多模态压缩器和流式弃权机制，在减少82%视觉标记、75%参数和71%延迟的同时，在多个长文档基准测试中达到或超越最先进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在长文档理解方面表现出色，但内存占用过高，无法在资源受限的边缘设备上部署。需要开发高效的小型模型来解决这一问题。

Method: DocSLM采用分层多模态压缩器联合编码每页的视觉、文本和布局信息为固定长度序列，减少内存消耗同时保留局部和全局语义；引入流式弃权机制，通过基于熵的不确定性校准器顺序处理文档片段并过滤低置信度响应。

Result: 在多个长多模态文档基准测试中，DocSLM使用82%更少的视觉标记、75%更少的参数和71%更低的延迟，性能达到或超越最先进方法。

Conclusion: DocSLM能够在轻量级边缘设备上提供可靠的多模态文档理解能力，解决了大型模型在资源受限环境下的部署问题。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong multimodal reasoning capabilities on long and complex documents. However, their high memory footprint makes them impractical for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. We present DocSLM, an efficient Small Vision-Language Model designed for long-document understanding under constrained memory resources. DocSLM incorporates a Hierarchical Multimodal Compressor that jointly encodes visual, textual, and layout information from each page into a fixed-length sequence, greatly reducing memory consumption while preserving both local and global semantics. To enable scalable processing over arbitrarily long inputs, we introduce a Streaming Abstention mechanism that operates on document segments sequentially and filters low-confidence responses using an entropy-based uncertainty calibrator. Across multiple long multimodal document benchmarks, DocSLM matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods while using 82\% fewer visual tokens, 75\% fewer parameters, and 71\% lower latency, delivering reliable multimodal document understanding on lightweight edge devices. Code is available in the supplementary material.

*Pavel Rojtberg,Julius Kühn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YCB-Ev SD是一个用于6自由度物体姿态估计的标准分辨率事件相机合成数据集，包含50,000个事件序列，采用基于物理渲染和线性相机运动模拟生成，通过系统评估确定了最佳的事件表示方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决事件视觉领域缺乏与帧基计算机视觉相媲美的综合性合成数据资源的问题，为6DoF物体姿态估计提供标准化的基准数据集。

Method: 使用基于物理渲染(PBR)场景和BOP方法学，通过模拟线性相机运动生成合成事件数据，系统评估不同事件表示方法在CNN推理中的性能。

Result: 发现具有线性衰减的时间表面和双通道极性编码在姿态估计性能上表现最佳，显著优于指数衰减和单通道替代方案，极性信息对性能提升贡献最大。

Conclusion: 成功创建了首个综合性事件相机合成数据集，确定了最优的事件表示方法，为事件视觉研究提供了可直接使用的基准资源。

Abstract: We introduce YCB-Ev SD, a synthetic dataset of event-camera data at standard definition (SD) resolution for 6DoF object pose estimation. While synthetic data has become fundamental in frame-based computer vision, event-based vision lacks comparable comprehensive resources. Addressing this gap, we present 50,000 event sequences of 34 ms duration each, synthesized from Physically Based Rendering (PBR) scenes of YCB-Video objects following the Benchmark for 6D Object Pose (BOP) methodology. Our generation framework employs simulated linear camera motion to ensure complete scene coverage, including background activity.
  Through systematic evaluation of event representations for CNN-based inference, we demonstrate that time-surfaces with linear decay and dual-channel polarity encoding achieve superior pose estimation performance, outperforming exponential decay and single-channel alternatives by significant margins. Our analysis reveals that polarity information contributes most substantially to performance gains, while linear temporal encoding preserves critical motion information more effectively than exponential decay. The dataset is provided in a structured format with both raw event streams and precomputed optimal representations to facilitate immediate research use and reproducible benchmarking.
  The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/paroj/ycbev_sd.

*Sheng Liu,Yuanzhi Liang,Sidan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Free3D是一个无需3D运动标注的3D人体运动生成框架，通过2D运动序列映射到3D一致潜在空间，并使用3D无关正则化目标实现视图一致性、方向连贯性和物理合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D人体运动生成模型虽然重建精度高，但难以泛化到训练分布之外，这源于精确3D监督使模型拟合固定坐标模式而非学习必要的3D结构和运动语义线索。

Method: 提出Motion-Lifting Residual Quantized VAE (ML-RQ)将2D运动序列映射到3D一致潜在空间，并采用视图一致性、方向连贯性和物理合理性等3D无关正则化目标。

Result: 仅使用2D运动数据训练，Free3D能生成多样化、时间连贯且语义对齐的3D运动，性能达到甚至超过完全3D监督的模型。

Conclusion: 放松显式3D监督能促进更强的结构推理和泛化能力，为3D运动生成提供了可扩展且数据高效的范式。

Abstract: Recent 3D human motion generation models demonstrate remarkable reconstruction accuracy yet struggle to generalize beyond training distributions. This limitation arises partly from the use of precise 3D supervision, which encourages models to fit fixed coordinate patterns instead of learning the essential 3D structure and motion semantic cues required for robust generalization.To overcome this limitation, we propose Free3D, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D motions without any 3D motion annotations. Free3D introduces a Motion-Lifting Residual Quantized VAE (ML-RQ) that maps 2D motion sequences into 3D-consistent latent spaces, and a suite of 3D-free regularization objectives enforcing view consistency, orientation coherence, and physical plausibility. Trained entirely on 2D motion data, Free3D generates diverse, temporally coherent, and semantically aligned 3D motions, achieving performance comparable to or even surpassing fully 3D-supervised counterparts. These results suggest that relaxing explicit 3D supervision encourages stronger structural reasoning and generalization, offering a scalable and data-efficient paradigm for 3D motion generation.

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合了无监督学习和快速分割的优势，提出的预训练策略显著减少了训练分割模型所需的标注数据量。

Abstract: Extracting digital material representations from images is a necessary prerequisite for a quantitative analysis of material properties. Different segmentation approaches have been extensively studied in the past to achieve this task, but were often lacking accuracy or speed. With the advent of machine learning, supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance for different segmentation tasks. However, these models are often trained in a supervised manner, which requires large labeled datasets. Unsupervised approaches do not require ground-truth data for learning, but suffer from long segmentation times and often worse segmentation accuracy. Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRF) are an unsupervised segmentation approach that incorporates concepts of neighborhood and class distributions. We present a method that integrates HMRF theory and CNN segmentation, leveraging the advantages of both areas: unsupervised learning and fast segmentation times. We investigate the contribution of different neighborhood terms and components for the unsupervised HMRF loss. We demonstrate that the HMRF-UNet enables high segmentation accuracy without ground truth on a Micro-Computed Tomography ($μ$CT) image dataset of Polyurethane (PU) foam structures. Finally, we propose and demonstrate a pre-training strategy that considerably reduces the required amount of ground-truth data when training a segmentation model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了基于低秩稀疏原则的LSEF框架，通过分层建模情感动态，将情感分解为长期情感基和短期情感波动，显著提升了视频情感计算的鲁棒性和动态区分能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频情感计算面临模型不稳定和表征退化问题，主要由于缺乏分层结构机制来解耦不同的情感成分（情感基和瞬时波动），无法在不同情感背景下区分不同情感波动的含义。

Method: 提出LSEF框架，包含三个即插即用模块：稳定性编码模块（SEM）捕获低秩情感基；动态解耦模块（DDM）分离稀疏瞬时信号；一致性集成模块（CIM）重建多尺度稳定性和反应性一致性。采用秩感知优化策略自适应平衡梯度平滑性和敏感性。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验证实，LSEF显著增强了鲁棒性和动态区分能力，验证了分层低秩稀疏建模在理解情感动态方面的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: 分层低秩稀疏建模为理解情感动态提供了有效的理论框架，LSEF通过解耦情感成分和重建一致性，成功解决了视频情感计算中的稳定性和表征退化问题。

Abstract: Video-based Affective Computing (VAC), vital for emotion analysis and human-computer interaction, suffers from model instability and representational degradation due to complex emotional dynamics. Since the meaning of different emotional fluctuations may differ under different emotional contexts, the core limitation is the lack of a hierarchical structural mechanism to disentangle distinct affective components, i.e., emotional bases (the long-term emotional tone), and transient fluctuations (the short-term emotional fluctuations). To address this, we propose the Low-Rank Sparse Emotion Understanding Framework (LSEF), a unified model grounded in the Low-Rank Sparse Principle, which theoretically reframes affective dynamics as a hierarchical low-rank sparse compositional process. LSEF employs three plug-and-play modules, i.e., the Stability Encoding Module (SEM) captures low-rank emotional bases; the Dynamic Decoupling Module (DDM) isolates sparse transient signals; and the Consistency Integration Module (CIM) reconstructs multi-scale stability and reactivity coherence. This framework is optimized by a Rank Aware Optimization (RAO) strategy that adaptively balances gradient smoothness and sensitivity. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets confirm that LSEF significantly enhances robustness and dynamic discrimination, which further validates the effectiveness and generality of hierarchical low-rank sparse modeling for understanding affective dynamics.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models are increasingly applied to biomedical imaging, yet scientific reasoning for microscopy remains limited by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. We introduce MicroVQA++, a three-stage, large-scale and high-quality microscopy VQA corpus derived from the BIOMEDICA archive. Stage one bootstraps supervision from expert-validated figure-caption pairs sourced from peer-reviewed articles. Stage two applies HiCQA-Graph, a novel heterogeneous graph over images, captions, and QAs that fuses NLI-based textual entailment, CLIP-based vision-language alignment, and agent signals to identify and filter inconsistent samples. Stage three uses a MultiModal Large Language Model (MLLM) agent to generate multiple-choice questions (MCQ) followed by human screening. The resulting release comprises a large training split and a human-checked test split whose Bloom's level hard-sample distribution exceeds the MicroVQA benchmark. Our work delivers (i) a quality-controlled dataset that couples expert literature with graph-based filtering and human refinement; (ii) HiCQA-Graph, the first graph that jointly models (image, caption, QA) for cross-modal consistency filtering; (iii) evidence that careful data construction enables 4B-scale MLLMs to reach competitive microscopy reasoning performance (e.g., GPT-5) and achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs. Code and dataset will be released after the review process concludes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在文档图像质量评估方面的潜力尚未充分探索，需要系统评估其在该领域的能力。

Method: 提出三层次评估框架：粗粒度质量评分、中粒度失真类型识别（单选和多选）、细粒度失真严重程度分类。使用思维链提示来提升性能。

Result: 评估显示MLLMs具备初步的DIQA能力，但存在评分不一致、失真误识别和严重程度误判等关键限制。思维链提示显著提升了所有层次的性能。

Conclusion: 该工作为MLLMs的DIQA能力提供了基准，揭示了其在质量感知方面的明显缺陷，并指出了增强的可行路径。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has expanded their capabilities beyond high-level vision tasks. Nevertheless, their potential for Document Image Quality Assessment (DIQA) remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose Q-Doc, a three-tiered evaluation framework for systematically probing DIQA capabilities of MLLMs at coarse, middle, and fine granularity levels. a) At the coarse level, we instruct MLLMs to assign quality scores to document images and analyze their correlation with Quality Annotations. b) At the middle level, we design distortion-type identification tasks, including single-choice and multi-choice tests for multi-distortion scenarios. c) At the fine level, we introduce distortion-severity assessment where MLLMs classify distortion intensity against human-annotated references. Our evaluation demonstrates that while MLLMs possess nascent DIQA abilities, they exhibit critical limitations: inconsistent scoring, distortion misidentification, and severity misjudgment. Significantly, we show that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting substantially enhances performance across all levels. Our work provides a benchmark for DIQA capabilities in MLLMs, revealing pronounced deficiencies in their quality perception and promising pathways for enhancement.

### [75] [BOFA: Bridge-Layer Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion for CLIP-Based Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11421)
*Lan Li,Tao Hu,Da-Wei Zhou,Han-Jia Ye,De-Chuan Zhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BOFA是一个新颖的类增量学习框架，通过限制在CLIP的跨模态桥接层进行适配，无需额外参数，并利用正交低秩融合机制防止遗忘，结合跨模态混合原型提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将CLIP应用于类增量学习面临两个主要挑战：(1) 适配下游任务需要额外可学习模块，增加模型复杂度和遗忘风险；(2) 现有方法未能充分利用多模态表示的优势来有效整合视觉和文本模态。

Method: BOFA框架将所有模型适配限制在CLIP现有的跨模态桥接层，采用正交低秩融合机制将参数更新约束在数学构造的与过去任务特征正交的低秩安全子空间中，并使用结合稳定文本原型和视觉对应物的跨模态混合原型。

Result: 在标准基准测试上的广泛实验表明，BOFA在准确性和效率方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BOFA通过桥接层正交融合适配，实现了无需数据回放的稳定知识积累，在类增量学习中取得了优越的性能。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to continually learn new categories without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Vision-language models such as CLIP offer strong transferable representations via multi-modal supervision, making them promising for CIL. However, applying CLIP to CIL poses two major challenges: (1) adapting to downstream tasks often requires additional learnable modules, increasing model complexity and susceptibility to forgetting; and (2) while multi-modal representations offer complementary strengths, existing methods have yet to fully realize their potential in effectively integrating visual and textual modalities. To address these issues, we propose BOFA (Bridge-layer Orthogonal Fusion for Adaptation), a novel framework for CIL. BOFA confines all model adaptation exclusively to CLIP's existing cross-modal bridge-layer, thereby adding no extra parameters or inference cost. To prevent forgetting within this layer, it leverages Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion, a mechanism that constrains parameter updates to a low-rank ``safe subspace" mathematically constructed to be orthogonal to past task features. This ensures stable knowledge accumulation without data replay. Furthermore, BOFA employs a cross-modal hybrid prototype that synergizes stable textual prototypes with visual counterparts derived from our stably adapted bridge-layer, enhancing classification performance. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that BOFA achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出自适应教学范式来解决视觉特征与脑电信号之间的不对称对齐问题，通过让视觉模态动态调整其知识结构来匹配脑电信号的能力，在零样本脑到图像检索任务中达到60.2%的top-1准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统跨模态对齐方法忽视了视觉与脑电信号之间的根本不对称性，包括保真度差距（脑电信号噪声大）和语义差距（脑电信号语义表示浅层），导致泛化性能差。

Method: 提出自适应教学范式，通过ShrinkAdapter模块让视觉模态动态缩小和调整知识结构，采用无残差设计和瓶颈结构，使语义密集的视觉特征能够匹配脑电信号的能力。

Result: 在零样本脑到图像检索任务中达到60.2%的top-1准确率，比之前最先进方法提升了9.8%。

Conclusion: 教师模态必须缩小和适应来弥合视觉-脑电差距，为不对称对齐提供了新视角。

Abstract: Decoding visual features from EEG signals is a central challenge in neuroscience, with cross-modal alignment as the dominant approach. We argue that the relationship between visual and brain modalities is fundamentally asymmetric, characterized by two critical gaps: a Fidelity Gap (stemming from EEG's inherent noise and signal degradation, vs. vision's high-fidelity features) and a Semantic Gap (arising from EEG's shallow conceptual representation, vs. vision's rich semantic depth). Previous methods often overlook this asymmetry, forcing alignment between the two modalities as if they were equal partners and thereby leading to poor generalization. To address this, we propose the adaptive teaching paradigm. This paradigm empowers the ``teacher" modality (vision) to dynamically shrink and adjust its knowledge structure under task guidance, tailoring its semantically dense features to match the ``student" modality (EEG)'s capacity. We implement this paradigm with the ShrinkAdapter, a simple yet effective module featuring a residual-free design and a bottleneck structure. Through extensive experiments, we validate the underlying rationale and effectiveness of our paradigm. Our method achieves a top-1 accuracy of 60.2\% on the zero-shot brain-to-image retrieval task, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 9.8\%. Our work introduces a new perspective for asymmetric alignment: the teacher must shrink and adapt to bridge the vision-brain gap.

TL;DR: WEAVE是首个用于上下文交错跨模态理解和生成的套件，包含WEAVE-100k大规模数据集和WEAVEBench人工标注基准，旨在解决现有方法在多轮、上下文感知图像生成和编辑方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统一多模态模型主要关注单轮交互，无法捕捉真实世界图像创建和编辑的多轮、上下文依赖特性，因此需要开发能够评估多轮上下文理解与生成能力的基准。

Method: 提出WEAVE套件：WEAVE-100k包含10万个交错样本，覆盖37万对话轮次和50万张图像；WEAVEBench包含100个基于480张图像的任务，采用基于参考图像和原始图像与编辑指令组合的混合VLM评判器评估框架。

Result: 实验表明，在WEAVE-100k上训练能够增强视觉理解、图像编辑以及理解-生成协作能力，促进统一多模态模型发展出新兴的视觉记忆能力，同时WEAVEBench评估揭示了当前方法在多轮上下文感知图像生成和编辑方面的持续局限性。

Conclusion: WEAVE为研究上下文交错理解和生成提供了视角和基础，有助于推动多模态社区在多轮交互场景下的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in unified multimodal models (UMMs) have enabled impressive progress in visual comprehension and generation. However, existing datasets and benchmarks focus primarily on single-turn interactions, failing to capture the multi-turn, context-dependent nature of real-world image creation and editing. To address this gap, we present WEAVE, the first suite for in-context interleaved cross-modality comprehension and generation. Our suite consists of two complementary parts. WEAVE-100k is a large-scale dataset of 100K interleaved samples spanning over 370K dialogue turns and 500K images, covering comprehension, editing, and generation tasks that require reasoning over historical context. WEAVEBench is a human-annotated benchmark with 100 tasks based on 480 images, featuring a hybrid VLM judger evaluation framework based on both the reference image and the combination of the original image with editing instructions that assesses models' abilities in multi-turn generation, visual memory, and world-knowledge reasoning across diverse domains. Experiments demonstrate that training on WEAVE-100k enables vision comprehension, image editing, and comprehension-generation collaboration capabilities. Furthermore, it facilitates UMMs to develop emergent visual-memory capabilities, while extensive evaluations on WEAVEBench expose the persistent limitations and challenges of current approaches in multi-turn, context-aware image generation and editing. We believe WEAVE provides a view and foundation for studying in-context interleaved comprehension and generation for multi-modal community.

TL;DR: 本文研究了文本到图像扩散模型中泛化与记忆之间的模糊性，重点关注多模态图标性现象——即图像和文本唤起文化共享关联的情况。作者提出了一个评估框架，区分识别（模型是否识别引用）和实现（如何通过复制或重新诠释来描绘引用），并评估了5个扩散模型在767个文化引用上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散模型中泛化与记忆之间的模糊界限，特别关注文化引用如何被识别和再现，超越简单的文本-图像匹配，实现更丰富的上下文理解。

Method: 引入评估框架分离识别和实现两个维度；使用Wikidata来源的767个文化引用评估5个扩散模型；进行提示扰动实验（同义词替换和字面图像描述）；分析文化对齐与训练数据频率、文本独特性、引用流行度和创建日期的相关性。

Result: 框架比现有基于相似性的方法更有效地区分复制与转换；模型即使文本线索改变也经常重现标志性视觉结构；文化对齐不仅与训练数据频率相关，还与文本独特性、引用流行度和创建日期相关。

Conclusion: 扩散模型的价值不仅在于它们重现了什么，更在于它们如何转换和重新情境化文化知识，推动评估超越简单的文本-图像匹配，实现更丰富的上下文理解。

Abstract: Our work addresses the ambiguity between generalization and memorization in text-to-image diffusion models, focusing on a specific case we term multimodal iconicity. This refers to instances where images and texts evoke culturally shared associations, such as when a title recalls a familiar artwork or film scene. While prior research on memorization and unlearning emphasizes forgetting, we examine what is remembered and how, focusing on the balance between recognizing cultural references and reproducing them. We introduce an evaluation framework that separates recognition, whether a model identifies a reference, from realization, how it depicts it through replication or reinterpretation, quantified through measures capturing both dimensions. By evaluating five diffusion models across 767 Wikidata-derived cultural references spanning static and dynamic imagery, we show that our framework distinguishes replication from transformation more effectively than existing similarity-based methods. To assess linguistic sensitivity, we conduct prompt perturbation experiments using synonym substitutions and literal image descriptions, finding that models often reproduce iconic visual structures even when textual cues are altered. Finally, our analysis shows that cultural alignment correlates not only with training data frequency, but also textual uniqueness, reference popularity, and creation date. Our work reveals that the value of diffusion models lies not only in what they reproduce but in how they transform and recontextualize cultural knowledge, advancing evaluation beyond simple text-image matching toward richer contextual understanding.

TL;DR: Hi-DREAM是一个受大脑启发的条件扩散框架，通过将fMRI信号按视觉皮层层次结构组织成多尺度皮层金字塔，在去噪过程中注入尺度特定的视觉提示，实现了高效且可解释的图像重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的解码器直接基于fMRI特征进行条件化，忽略了大脑的分层处理机制和不同视觉区域的功能差异，导致早期、中期和晚期视觉区域的作用模糊不清。

Method: 提出Hi-DREAM框架：1）ROI适配器将fMRI信号分组为早期/中期/晚期流，转换为与U-Net深度对齐的多尺度皮层金字塔；2）轻量级深度匹配ControlNet在去噪过程中注入尺度特定的视觉提示。

Result: 在自然场景数据集(NSD)上的实验表明，Hi-DREAM在高层次语义指标上达到最先进性能，同时保持竞争力的低层次保真度。

Conclusion: 按皮层层次结构组织条件化是纯数据驱动嵌入的强大替代方案，为研究视觉皮层提供了有用的视角。

Abstract: Mapping human brain activity to natural images offers a new window into vision and cognition, yet current diffusion-based decoders face a core difficulty: most condition directly on fMRI features without analyzing how visual information is organized across the cortex. This overlooks the brain's hierarchical processing and blurs the roles of early, middle, and late visual areas. We propose Hi-DREAM, a brain-inspired conditional diffusion framework that makes the cortical organization explicit. A region-of-interest (ROI) adapter groups fMRI into early/mid/late streams and converts them into a multi-scale cortical pyramid aligned with the U-Net depth (shallow scales preserve layout and edges; deeper scales emphasize objects and semantics). A lightweight, depth-matched ControlNet injects these scale-specific hints during denoising. The result is an efficient and interpretable decoder in which each signal plays a brain-like role, allowing the model not only to reconstruct images but also to illuminate functional contributions of different visual areas. Experiments on the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) show that Hi-DREAM attains state-of-the-art performance on high-level semantic metrics while maintaining competitive low-level fidelity. These findings suggest that structuring conditioning by cortical hierarchy is a powerful alternative to purely data-driven embeddings and provides a useful lens for studying the visual cortex.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准缺乏对MLLMs理解视觉提示（如边界框）能力的系统评估，而这是人类直观的交互方式，需要明确当前模型是否能有效识别和使用视觉提示。

Method: 采用两阶段评估框架：第一阶段测试模型在自然场景中感知视觉提示的能力，使用30k个可视化提示；第二阶段评估视觉提示对下游任务的影响。

Result: 评估了28个MLLMs（包括GPT-4o、InternVL3、Qwen2.5-VL等），分析了影响视觉提示理解的因素，如属性变化、问题安排和模型规模。

Conclusion: VP-Bench为研究MLLMs如何理解和解决基于视觉提示的指称问题建立了新的参考框架。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled a wide range of advanced vision-language applications, including fine-grained object recognition and contextual understanding. When querying specific regions or objects in an image, human users naturally use "visual prompts" (VPs), such as bounding boxes, to provide reference. However, no existing benchmark systematically evaluates the ability of MLLMs to interpret such VPs. This gap leaves it unclear whether current MLLMs can effectively recognize VPs, an intuitive prompting method for humans, and use them to solve problems. To address this limitation, we introduce VP-Bench, a benchmark for assessing MLLMs' capability in VP perception and utilization. VP-Bench employs a two-stage evaluation framework: Stage 1 examines models' ability to perceive VPs in natural scenes, using 30k visualized prompts spanning eight shapes and 355 attribute combinations. Stage 2 investigates the impact of VPs on downstream tasks, measuring their effectiveness in real-world problem-solving scenarios. Using VP-Bench, we evaluate 28 MLLMs, including proprietary systems (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-source models (e.g., InternVL3 and Qwen2.5-VL), and provide a comprehensive analysis of factors that affect VP understanding, such as variations in VP attributes, question arrangement, and model scale. VP-Bench establishes a new reference framework for studying how MLLMs comprehend and resolve grounded referring questions.

### [82] [Rethinking Efficient Mixture-of-Experts for Remote Sensing Modality-Missing Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11460)
*Qinghao Gao,Jianhai Qu,Yunsong Li,Weiqiang Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MaMOL的框架，用于解决遥感多模态分类中的模态缺失问题，通过双路由机制实现参数高效的自适应，在多个基准测试中表现出优越的鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感多模态分类常因环境干扰、传感器故障或大气效应导致模态缺失，严重影响分类性能。现有两阶段适应方法计算成本高且假设训练时具有完整多模态数据，限制了其在真实世界不完整情况下的泛化能力。

Method: 提出Missing-aware Mixture-of-Loras (MaMOL)框架，将模态缺失重新表述为多任务学习问题。引入双路由机制：任务导向的动态路由器自适应激活不同缺失模式的专家，以及模态特定共享的静态路由器维持稳定的跨模态知识共享。通过轻量级专家更新和共享专家重用实现参数高效适应。

Result: 在多个遥感基准测试中，在不同缺失率下表现出优越的鲁棒性和泛化能力，且计算开销最小。在自然图像数据集上的迁移实验验证了其可扩展性和跨领域适用性。

Conclusion: MaMOL为不完整多模态学习提供了一个通用且高效的解决方案，具有出色的鲁棒性、泛化能力和计算效率。

Abstract: Multimodal classification in remote sensing often suffers from missing modalities caused by environmental interference, sensor failures, or atmospheric effects, which severely degrade classification performance. Existing two-stage adaptation methods are computationally expensive and assume complete multimodal data during training, limiting their generalization to real-world incompleteness. To overcome these issues, we propose a Missing-aware Mixture-of-Loras (MaMOL) framework that reformulates modality missing as a multi-task learning problem. MaMOL introduces a dual-routing mechanism: a task-oriented dynamic router that adaptively activates experts for different missing patterns, and a modality-specific-shared static router that maintains stable cross-modal knowledge sharing. Unlike prior methods that train separate networks for each missing configuration, MaMOL achieves parameter-efficient adaptation via lightweight expert updates and shared expert reuse. Experiments on multiple remote sensing benchmarks demonstrate superior robustness and generalization under varying missing rates, with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, transfer experiments on natural image datasets validate its scalability and cross-domain applicability, highlighting MaMOL as a general and efficient solution for incomplete multimodal learning.

*Roman Kinakh,Gonzalo R. Ríos-Muñoz,Arrate Muñoz-Barrutia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: nnUNet-B是一个贝叶斯分割框架，通过多模态后验采样直接从H&E染色组织学图像推断PD-L1表达，提供准确分割和认知不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于免疫组织化学的PD-L1表达评估方法资源密集，需要开发更高效的替代方案。

Method: 基于nnUNet-v2构建，在循环训练期间采样多样化模型检查点来近似后验分布，通过熵和标准差实现不确定性估计。

Result: 在肺鳞状细胞癌数据集上，平均Dice分数0.805，平均IoU 0.709，性能与现有基线相当，同时提供像素级不确定性图。

Conclusion: 基于H&E的不确定性感知PD-L1预测是向临床工作流程中可扩展、可解释生物标志物评估迈出的有希望的一步。

Abstract: Accurate assessment of PD-L1 expression is critical for guiding immunotherapy, yet current immunohistochemistry (IHC) based methods are resource-intensive. We present nnUNet-B: a Bayesian segmentation framework that infers PD-L1 expression directly from H&E-stained histology images using Multimodal Posterior Sampling (MPS). Built upon nnUNet-v2, our method samples diverse model checkpoints during cyclic training to approximate the posterior, enabling both accurate segmentation and epistemic uncertainty estimation via entropy and standard deviation. Evaluated on a dataset of lung squamous cell carcinoma, our approach achieves competitive performance against established baselines with mean Dice Score and mean IoU of 0.805 and 0.709, respectively, while providing pixel-wise uncertainty maps. Uncertainty estimates show strong correlation with segmentation error, though calibration remains imperfect. These results suggest that uncertainty-aware H&E-based PD-L1 prediction is a promising step toward scalable, interpretable biomarker assessment in clinical workflows.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出Prelim Attention Score (PAS)方法，通过分析LVLM对先前生成token的注意力来检测对象幻觉，无需额外训练即可实时识别幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型存在对象幻觉问题，研究发现模型在产生幻觉预测时会忽略图像而依赖先前生成的token来推断新对象。

Method: 引入Prelim Attention Score (PAS)，基于对prelim token的注意力权重计算轻量级信号，无需额外前向传播，可在推理过程中实时计算。

Result: PAS在多个模型和数据集上实现了最先进的对象幻觉检测性能，能够进行实时过滤和干预。

Conclusion: 通过利用先前被忽视的注意力信号，PAS提供了一种有效的训练无关方法来检测和缓解LVLM中的对象幻觉问题。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are powerful, yet they remain unreliable due to object hallucinations. In this work, we show that in many hallucinatory predictions the LVLM effectively ignores the image and instead relies on previously generated output (prelim) tokens to infer new objects. We quantify this behavior via the mutual information between the image and the predicted object conditioned on the prelim, demonstrating that weak image dependence strongly correlates with hallucination. Building on this finding, we introduce the Prelim Attention Score (PAS), a lightweight, training-free signal computed from attention weights over prelim tokens. PAS requires no additional forward passes and can be computed on the fly during inference. Exploiting this previously overlooked signal, PAS achieves state-of-the-art object-hallucination detection across multiple models and datasets, enabling real-time filtering and intervention.

*Benjamin Fein-Ashley,Jacob Fein-Ashley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BRIDGE提出了一种轻量级的视觉-语言融合模块，通过在编码器顶部添加少量双向交叉注意力层来对齐视觉和文本的隐藏状态，在保持编码器效率的同时提升了多模态任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言模型要么在编码器早期融合特征，要么在后期比较池化嵌入，但两种模态的隐藏状态本身已包含丰富的模态特定结构信息，直接对齐这些状态是更自然的多模态匹配方式。

Method: 在视觉和文本编码器顶部附近添加少量仅交叉的双向注意力层，将隐藏状态投影到共享空间进行跨模态注意力计算，通过门控残差更新返回，并使用简单稳定器改善对齐效果。

Result: 在标准检索、VQA和视觉推理基准测试中，BRIDGE优于同类视觉-语言模型，同时保持了对比模型的双编码器效率。

Conclusion: BRIDGE证明了通过轻量级融合模块直接对齐编码器隐藏状态的有效性，在保持编码器理解能力和生成解耦的同时，显著提升了多模态任务的性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are a new family of models that align image content with natural language. Existing approaches typically fuse either (a) early: by mixing tokens/features inside the encoders, or (b) late: by comparing pooled embeddings. Many methods also tie fusion to an autoregressive decoder. However, the hidden states of both modalities already carry rich, modality-specific structure (spatial layout in vision; syntax and semantics in text), so directly aligning these states is a natural way to match what the two modalities "think". We propose a lightweight fusion module: a few cross-only, bidirectional attention layers placed near the top of both encoders. Each layer projects the vision and text encoder hidden-state sequences into a shared space, attends across modalities, and sends gated residual updates back, with simple stabilizers to improve alignment. The encoders remain non-causal and strong for understanding, while generation stays cleanly decoupled via an optional decoder. Across standard retrieval, VQA, and visual reasoning benchmarks, BRIDGE outperforms comparable VLMs while preserving the bi-encoder efficiency of contrastive models. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/jfeinashley/BRIDGE.

*Desheng Kong,Xiangshuo Cui,Jiaying Jin,Jing Xu,Donglin Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了第一个用于自然语言生成的混合量子-经典大语言模型HyQuT，该模型将变分量子电路集成到Transformer框架中，在8M和150M参数规模下实现了连贯且上下文感知的对话生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管量子计算已逐渐应用于替代经典计算，但现有量子或混合模型仍局限于简单任务，尚未成功应用于大规模自然语言生成。本研究旨在探索将量子计算整合到大规模生成语言模型中的可行性。

Method: 提出的HyQuT架构在Transformer框架中集成变分量子电路，在8M和150M参数规模下进行实验。使用最小量子资源（10个量子比特和80个量子门）替代约10%的经典参数。

Result: 实验结果表明，在150M参数模型中，仅使用10个量子比特和80个量子门就能替代约10%的经典参数，同时实现了可比较的收敛稳定性和生成质量。

Conclusion: 这项研究为将量子计算整合到大规模生成语言模型中提供了早期可行性证明，展示了量子计算在自然语言生成任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Although quantum computing has been increasingly applied to replace classical computation, most existing quantum or hybrid models remain confined to simple tasks, with no successful application to large-scale natural language generation to date. In this work, we present the first hybrid quantum-classical large language model (LLM) for natural language generation, HyQuT, capable of performing coherent and context-aware dialogue. The proposed architecture integrates variational quantum circuits (VQCs) into the Transformer framework at both 8M and 150M parameter scales. Experimental results show that a minimal number of qubits (10 qubits with 80 quantum gates) can replace about 10% of the classical parameters in the 150M-parameter model, while achieving comparable convergence stability and generation quality. This study provides an early demonstration of the feasibility of integrating quantum computing to large-scale generative language models.

### [87] [Empirical Characterization of Temporal Constraint Processing in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10654)
*Javier Marín*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在处理时间约束方面存在系统性风险，包括双峰性能分布、极端提示脆弱性和系统性行动偏见，表明当前自回归架构无法可靠处理时间关键任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试LLM在需要实时决策的智能体架构中处理时间约束的可靠性，这一假设尚未经过验证。

Method: 使用截止时间检测任务评估8个生产级模型（2.8-8B参数），分析时间约束处理能力，并通过200个合成示例进行微调实验。

Result: 发现系统性部署风险：双峰性能分布（95%或50%准确率）、极端提示脆弱性（格式变化导致30-60个百分点波动）和系统性行动偏见（失败模型100%假阳性率）。参数数量与能力无相关性。

Conclusion: 时间约束满足无法通过自然语言的下一个词预测可靠学习，需要具备连续时间状态表示、显式约束检查和系统性组合推理的架构机制，当前自回归架构缺乏这些机制。

Abstract: When deploying LLMs in agentic architectures requiring real-time decisions under temporal constraints, we assume they reliably determine whether action windows remain open or have closed. This assumption is untested. We characterize temporal constraint processing across eight production-scale models (2.8-8B parameters) using deadline detection tasks, revealing systematic deployment risks: bimodal performance distribution (models achieve either 95% or 50% accuracy), extreme prompt brittleness (30-60 percentage point swings from formatting changes alone), and systematic action bias (100% false positive rates in failing models). Parameter count shows no correlation with capability in this range-a 3.8B model matches 7B models while other 7B models fail completely. Fine-tuning on 200 synthetic examples improves models with partial capability by 12-37 percentage points. We demonstrate that temporal constraint satisfaction cannot be reliably learned through next-token prediction on natural language, even with targeted fine-tuning. This capability requires architectural mechanisms for: (1) continuous temporal state representation, (2) explicit constraint checking separate from linguistic pattern matching, (3) systematic compositional reasoning over temporal relations. Current autoregressive architectures lack these mechanisms. Deploying such systems in time-critical applications without hybrid architectures incorporating symbolic reasoning modules represents unacceptable risk.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文扩展了Spectral NSR框架，通过引入三种语义增强：基于transformer的节点合并、句子级蕴涵验证和外部知识图谱对齐，在不改变核心谱推理引擎的情况下提升图质量，在多个基准测试中实现了准确率提升和推理噪声降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Spectral NSR框架在推理过程中存在冗余节点、边缘质量不足和上下文缺失的问题，需要在不改变核心谱推理引擎的前提下提升图质量。

Method: 1) 使用基于transformer的节点合并减少冗余；2) 使用预训练NLI分类器进行句子级蕴涵验证提升边缘质量；3) 与外部知识图谱对齐增强缺失上下文。这些改进完全在谱推理阶段之前进行。

Result: 在ProofWriter、EntailmentBank和CLUTRR基准测试中，准确率提升最高达3.8%，改善了对抗性案例的泛化能力，并减少了推理噪声。

Conclusion: 该工作通过模块化、语义基础的预处理步骤扩展了Spectral NSR框架，在不改变核心谱推理引擎的情况下实现了更鲁棒、可解释和可扩展的推理系统。

Abstract: This report extends the Spectral Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning (Spectral NSR) framework by introducing three semantically grounded enhancements: (1) transformer-based node merging using contextual embeddings (e.g., Sentence-BERT, SimCSE) to reduce redundancy, (2) sentence-level entailment validation with pretrained NLI classifiers (e.g., RoBERTa, DeBERTa) to improve edge quality, and (3) alignment with external knowledge graphs (e.g., ConceptNet, Wikidata) to augment missing context. These modifications enhance graph fidelity while preserving the core spectral reasoning pipeline. Experimental results on ProofWriter, EntailmentBank, and CLUTRR benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains (up to +3.8\%), improved generalization to adversarial cases, and reduced inference noise. The novelty lies in performing semantic and symbolic refinement entirely upstream of the spectral inference stage, enabling efficient, interpretable, and scalable reasoning without relying on quadratic attention mechanisms. In summary, this work extends the Spectral NSR framework with modular, semantically grounded preprocessing steps that improve graph quality without altering the core spectral reasoning engine. The result is a more robust, interpretable, and scalable reasoning system suitable for deployment in open-domain and real-world settings.

TL;DR: 提出了PRO框架，通过轻量级偏好适配器自动推断特定提示的偏好权重，解决多目标对齐中手动指定权重的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖手动指定偏好权重，不仅增加用户负担，还因探索不相关偏好组合导致训练效率低下。

Method: 使用轻量级偏好适配器，在训练和部署阶段自动学习每个提示的适当偏好权重，基于多个奖励模型对偏好响应的归一化奖励分数进行训练。

Result: 理论分析证明该方法在多目标对齐场景中优于固定偏好权重，多个任务的广泛实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: PRO框架通过自动推断提示特定偏好权重，有效解决了多目标对齐中的偏好权重指定问题，提升了训练效率和性能。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse natural language processing tasks, aligning these models with varying human preferences across multiple objectives remains a significant challenge in practical deployments. Existing multi-objective alignment methods rely on manually specified preference weights, which not only burden users with difficult preference specification tasks but also lead to suboptimal training efficiency due to exploration of irrelevant preference combinations. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel framework named PRO, i.e., PReference Orchestrator, which features a lightweight preference adapter that automatically infers prompt-specific preference weights during both training and deployment phases. Specifically, the adapter automatically learns appropriate preference weights for each prompt by training on normalized reward scores from multiple reward models for preferred responses, which inherently reflect effective preference balances across objectives. Additionally, We provide theoretical analysis proving that our prompt-aware preference mechanism achieves superior performance compared to fixed preference weights in multi-objective alignment scenarios. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over existing multi-objective alignment approaches.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于对比学习的专利嵌入框架，通过利用同一文档内的多视图（如摘要、权利要求、背景等不同部分）来学习专利表示，解决了SimCSE风格dropout增强在专利数据上导致嵌入过度均匀的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对SimCSE风格dropout增强在专利数据上产生过度均匀嵌入、丧失语义凝聚性的问题，需要一种能够利用专利固有结构多样性的增强方法。

Method: 提出基于专利章节的增强方法，将专利的不同部分（摘要、权利要求、背景等）作为互补视图，引入自然的语义和结构多样性。

Result: 在大规模基准测试中，这种完全自监督的方法在先有技术检索和分类任务上匹配或超越了基于引用和IPC监督的基线方法，同时避免了依赖脆弱或不完整的标注。

Conclusion: 不同专利章节在不同任务中具有专门化作用，权利要求和摘要有利于检索，背景部分有助于分类，凸显了利用专利固有语篇结构进行表示学习的价值。

Abstract: This paper presents a simple yet effective contrastive learning framework for learning patent embeddings by leveraging multiple views from within the same document. We first identify a patent-specific failure mode of SimCSE style dropout augmentation: it produces overly uniform embeddings that lose semantic cohesion. To remedy this, we propose section-based augmentation, where different sections of a patent (e.g., abstract, claims, background) serve as complementary views. This design introduces natural semantic and structural diversity, mitigating over-dispersion and yielding embeddings that better preserve both global structure and local continuity. On large-scale benchmarks, our fully self-supervised method matches or surpasses citation-and IPC-supervised baselines in prior-art retrieval and classification, while avoiding reliance on brittle or incomplete annotations. Our analysis further shows that different sections specialize for different tasks-claims and summaries benefit retrieval, while background sections aid classification-highlighting the value of patents' inherent discourse structure for representation learning. These results highlight the value of exploiting intra-document views for scalable and generalizable patent understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注单一任务、有限模型和英文报告，需要评估开源LLM在多疾病、多语言、多机构临床记录中的结构化信息提取能力。

Method: 使用15个开源LLM（包括通用和医学专用模型），在6种疾病用例中应用6种提示策略（零样本、单样本、少样本、思维链、自一致性和提示图），通过共识排名聚合和线性混合效应模型量化方差。

Result: 排名靠前的模型在各项任务中达到接近评分者间一致性的宏观平均分数，中小型通用模型与大型模型性能相当，提示图和少样本提示可提升约13%性能。

Conclusion: 开源LLM能够跨疾病、语言和机构从临床报告中提取结构化数据，为临床数据管理提供可扩展的方法，任务特定因素比模型大小或提示策略影响更大。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to extract structured information from free-text clinical records, but prior work often focuses on single tasks, limited models, and English-language reports. We evaluated 15 open-weight LLMs on pathology and radiology reports across six use cases, colorectal liver metastases, liver tumours, neurodegenerative diseases, soft-tissue tumours, melanomas, and sarcomas, at three institutes in the Netherlands, UK, and Czech Republic. Models included general-purpose and medical-specialised LLMs of various sizes, and six prompting strategies were compared: zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, self-consistency, and prompt graph. Performance was assessed using task-appropriate metrics, with consensus rank aggregation and linear mixed-effects models quantifying variance. Top-ranked models achieved macro-average scores close to inter-rater agreement across tasks. Small-to-medium general-purpose models performed comparably to large models, while tiny and specialised models performed worse. Prompt graph and few-shot prompting improved performance by ~13%. Task-specific factors, including variable complexity and annotation variability, influenced results more than model size or prompting strategy. These findings show that open-weight LLMs can extract structured data from clinical reports across diseases, languages, and institutions, offering a scalable approach for clinical data curation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过加权专家乘积（wPoE）进行测试时引导的新框架，将通用压缩模型与预训练神经语言模型自适应结合，确保压缩率至少与最佳单个模型相当，无需微调即可提升文本压缩性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统通用压缩器（如gzip）计算开销低、速度快、适用范围广，但压缩率不如现代神经压缩器；而神经压缩器虽然能更好地建模数据分布，但在未见数据上泛化能力差。需要解决这一局限性。

Method: 使用加权专家乘积（wPoE）框架，在推理时自适应地结合通用压缩模型和预训练神经语言模型，确保压缩率不低于最佳单个模型。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法无需微调即可提升文本压缩性能，并能与任何自回归语言模型无缝集成。

Conclusion: 该框架为跨不同数据分布的文本压缩提供了实用的增强解决方案，结合了传统压缩器和神经压缩器的优势。

Abstract: Lossless compression techniques are crucial in an era of rapidly growing data. Traditional universal compressors like gzip offer low computational overhead, high speed, and broad applicability across data distributions. However, they often lead to worse compression rates than modern neural compressors, which leverage large-scale training data to model data distributions more effectively. Despite their advantages, neural compressors struggle to generalize to unseen data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that performs Test-Time Steering via a Weighted Product of Experts (wPoE). At inference, our method adaptively combines a universal compression model with a pretrained neural language model, ensuring the compression rate is at least as good as that of the best individual model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of text compression without requiring fine-tuning. Furthermore, it seamlessly integrates with any autoregressive language model, providing a practical solution for enhancing text compression across diverse data distributions.

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型评估方法往往忽视统计不确定性量化，而LLM的随机性文本生成会引入显著的不确定性，需要更严谨的统计方法来评估模型行为。

Method: 采用贝叶斯方法来量化二元评估指标的不确定性，特别关注由概率文本生成策略引起的不确定性，并通过两个案例研究验证该方法。

Result: 该方法能够为LLM系统行为提供有用的不确定性量化，在拒绝率评估和成对偏好评估两个案例中都展示了良好的应用效果。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯方法能够有效量化LLM评估中的统计不确定性，为模型行为评估提供更可靠的统计基础。

Abstract: It is increasingly important to evaluate how text generation systems based on large language models (LLMs) behave, such as their tendency to produce harmful output or their sensitivity to adversarial inputs. Such evaluations often rely on a curated benchmark set of input prompts provided to the LLM, where the output for each prompt may be assessed in a binary fashion (e.g., harmful/non-harmful or does not leak/leaks sensitive information), and the aggregation of binary scores is used to evaluate the LLM. However, existing approaches to evaluation often neglect statistical uncertainty quantification. With an applied statistics audience in mind, we provide background on LLM text generation and evaluation, and then describe a Bayesian approach for quantifying uncertainty in binary evaluation metrics. We focus in particular on uncertainty that is induced by the probabilistic text generation strategies typically deployed in LLM-based systems. We present two case studies applying this approach: 1) evaluating refusal rates on a benchmark of adversarial inputs designed to elicit harmful responses, and 2) evaluating pairwise preferences of one LLM over another on a benchmark of open-ended interactive dialogue examples. We demonstrate how the Bayesian approach can provide useful uncertainty quantification about the behavior of LLM-based systems.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of seven cutting-edge LLMs -- including GPT-4o, GPT-4, Claude~3.5~Sonnet, LLaMA~3.1, Mistral~Large~2, LLaMA-2~Chat~13B, and Mistral~7B~Instruct -- on a new cross-lingual benchmark covering \textbf{Cantonese, Japanese, and Turkish}. Our benchmark spans four diverse tasks: open-domain question answering, document summarization, English-to-X translation, and culturally grounded dialogue. We combine \textbf{human evaluations} (rating fluency, factual accuracy, and cultural appropriateness) with automated metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) to assess model performance.
  Our results reveal that while the largest proprietary models (GPT-4o, GPT-4, Claude~3.5) generally lead across languages and tasks, significant gaps persist in culturally nuanced understanding and morphological generalization. Notably, GPT-4o demonstrates robust multilingual performance even on cross-lingual tasks, and Claude~3.5~Sonnet achieves competitive accuracy on knowledge and reasoning benchmarks. However, all models struggle to some extent with the unique linguistic challenges of each language, such as Turkish agglutinative morphology and Cantonese colloquialisms. Smaller open-source models (LLaMA-2~13B, Mistral~7B) lag substantially in fluency and accuracy, highlighting the resource disparity. We provide detailed quantitative results, qualitative error analysis, and discuss implications for developing more culturally aware and linguistically generalizable LLMs. Our benchmark and evaluation data are released to foster reproducibility and further research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自监督框架，通过使用偏斜感知聚合策略来增强保护模型的语义鲁棒性，减少语义变异性58%，提高基准准确率2.5%，并改善校准度达40%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保护模型对表面语言变化的敏感性是LLM安全的关键漏洞，即使意义保持不变的改写也会导致安全评分大幅波动，表明缺乏语义基础。

Method: 引入实用的自监督框架，利用改写集通过新颖的偏斜感知聚合策略来强制执行预测一致性，用于稳健目标计算。

Result: 分析六个开源保护模型显示，该方法将语义变异性降低约58%，基准准确率平均提高约2.5%，并能泛化到未见过的风格变化。发现模型校准与一致性之间存在双向关系，鲁棒性训练可将校准度提高达40%。

Conclusion: 将语义一致性作为首要训练目标具有重要价值，为构建更可靠保护模型提供了可扩展方案。

Abstract: Guard models are a critical component of LLM safety, but their sensitivity to superficial linguistic variations remains a key vulnerability. We show that even meaning-preserving paraphrases can cause large fluctuations in safety scores, revealing a lack of semantic grounding. To address this, we introduce a practical, self-supervised framework for improving the semantic robustness of guard models. Our method leverages paraphrase sets to enforce prediction consistency using a novel, skew-aware aggregation strategy for robust target computation. Notably, we find that standard aggregation methods like mean and median can degrade safety, underscoring the need for skew-aware alternatives. We analyze six open-source guard models and show that our approach reduces semantic variability across paraphrases by ~58%, improves benchmark accuracy by ~2.5% on average, and generalizes to unseen stylistic variations. Intriguingly, we discover a bidirectional relationship between model calibration and consistency: our robustness training improves calibration by up to 40%, revealing a fundamental connection between these properties. These results highlight the value of treating semantic consistency as a first-class training objective and provide a scalable recipe for building more reliable guard models.

*Sichao Li,Xinyue Xu,Xiaomeng Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了STaDS框架，通过结构化表格决策模拟来评估LLM的真实理解能力，发现大多数前沿模型在不同领域难以保持一致的准确性，且存在预测准确性与决策因素不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM虽然预测准确率高，但正确性并不等同于真实理解。需要评估LLM是否能在多个实例和不同领域中做出一致、有依据的决策，并依赖相关领域决策因素。

Method: 引入STaDS框架，通过结构化决策"考试"评估LLM的专业能力，从三个维度联合评估理解能力：问题与指令理解、基于知识的预测、对相关决策因素的依赖。

Result: 对9个前沿LLM在15个不同决策场景中的分析显示：(a)大多数模型难以在不同领域保持一致的强准确性；(b)模型可能准确但全局不忠实，存在陈述理由与预测驱动因素之间的频繁不匹配。

Conclusion: 研究强调需要全局层面的理解评估协议，并倡导超越准确性的新框架来增强LLM的理解能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often achieve impressive predictive accuracy, yet correctness alone does not imply genuine understanding. True LLM understanding, analogous to human expertise, requires making consistent, well-founded decisions across multiple instances and diverse domains, relying on relevant and domain-grounded decision factors. We introduce Structured Tabular Decision Simulations (STaDS), a suite of expert-like decision settings that evaluate LLMs as if they were professionals undertaking structured decision ``exams''. In this context, understanding is defined as the ability to identify and rely on the correct decision factors, features that determine outcomes within a domain. STaDS jointly assesses understanding through: (i) question and instruction comprehension, (ii) knowledge-based prediction, and (iii) reliance on relevant decision factors. By analyzing 9 frontier LLMs across 15 diverse decision settings, we find that (a) most models struggle to achieve consistently strong accuracy across diverse domains; (b) models can be accurate yet globally unfaithful, and there are frequent mismatches between stated rationales and factors driving predictions. Our findings highlight the need for global-level understanding evaluation protocols and advocate for novel frameworks that go beyond accuracy to enhance LLMs' understanding ability.

TL;DR: 本研究比较了传统机器学习与深度迁移学习在预测儿童人工耳蜗植入后语言发展方面的表现，发现基于脑神经解剖特征的深度迁移学习模型在准确率、敏感性和特异性方面均优于传统机器学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工耳蜗植入虽然能显著改善重度感音神经性听力损失儿童的语言能力，但个体间效果差异很大，且无法通过植入年龄或残余听力可靠预测。本研究旨在探索更准确的预测方法。

Method: 采用278名植入儿童的数据，比较基于脑神经解剖特征的传统机器学习和深度迁移学习二元分类模型，使用双线性注意力融合策略。

Result: 深度迁移学习模型达到92.39%的准确率、91.22%的敏感性、93.56%的特异性，AUC为0.977，在所有指标上均优于传统机器学习模型。

Conclusion: 深度迁移学习通过直接捕获判别性和任务特定信息，显著提升了预测性能，支持开发适用于全球CI项目的单一预测模型的可行性。

Abstract: Cochlear implants (CI) significantly improve spoken language in children with severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), yet outcomes remain more variable than in children with normal hearing. This variability cannot be reliably predicted for individual children using age at implantation or residual hearing. This study aims to compare the accuracy of traditional machine learning (ML) to deep transfer learning (DTL) algorithms to predict post-CI spoken language development of children with bilateral SNHL using a binary classification model of high versus low language improvers. A total of 278 implanted children enrolled from three centers. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of prediction models based upon brain neuroanatomic features using traditional ML and DTL learning. DTL prediction models using bilinear attention-based fusion strategy achieved: accuracy of 92.39% (95% CI, 90.70%-94.07%), sensitivity of 91.22% (95% CI, 89.98%-92.47%), specificity of 93.56% (95% CI, 90.91%-96.21%), and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.977 (95% CI, 0.969-0.986). DTL outperformed traditional ML models in all outcome measures. DTL was significantly improved by direct capture of discriminative and task-specific information that are advantages of representation learning enabled by this approach over ML. The results support the feasibility of a single DTL prediction model for language prediction of children served by CI programs worldwide.

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过MoE语音投影器和多阶段训练范式，有效解决了CS语音翻译中的语义建模和数据稀缺问题，为CS语音翻译任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Code-switching (CS) speech translation (ST) refers to translating speech that alternates between two or more languages into a target language text, which poses significant challenges due to the complexity of semantic modeling and the scarcity of CS data. Previous studies tend to rely on the model itself to implicitly learn semantic modeling during training, and resort to inefficient and costly manual annotations for these two challenges. To mitigate these limitations, we propose enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) speech projector, where each expert specializes in the semantic subspace of a specific language, enabling fine-grained modeling of speech features. Additionally, we introduce a multi-stage training paradigm that utilizes readily available monolingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) and monolingual ST data, facilitating speech-text alignment and improving translation capabilities. During training, we leverage a combination of language-specific loss and intra-group load balancing loss to guide the MoE speech projector in efficiently allocating tokens to the appropriate experts, across expert groups and within each group, respectively. To bridge the data gap across different training stages and improve adaptation to the CS scenario, we further employ a transition loss, enabling smooth transitions of data between stages, to effectively address the scarcity of high-quality CS speech translation data. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our approach.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了Grounded Visual Factualization (GVF)微调方法，通过三种核心机制系统性地增强多模态大语言模型的视觉事实一致性，显著减少视觉幻觉现象，同时在通用多模态基准上保持或略微提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型中的视觉幻觉问题严重损害了其可靠性，现有的微调方法改进有限，无法深入干预事实推理过程。

Method: GVF微调通过三个核心机制集成显式事实信号：事实锚点数据增强（使用结构化事实锚点和反事实提示丰富训练数据）、事实感知指令调优（将事实线索嵌入显式指令）、以及事实一致性损失函数（专门惩罚事实不准确性）。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-13B模型上评估，GVF微调在VHTest基准测试中显著优于标准微调，适用于开放式问题和是/否问题格式。在MME和POPE等通用多模态基准上保持或略微提升性能。

Conclusion: GVF方法有效缓解了视觉幻觉问题，同时不损害通用的理解和推理能力，为提升多模态大语言模型的可靠性提供了系统性的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual hallucination, where Multimodal Large Language Models fabricate details inconsistent with image content, critically undermines their reliability. Existing fine-tuning methods offer limited improvement, failing to deeply intervene in factual reasoning. This paper introduces Grounded Visual Factualization (GVF) Finetuning, a novel approach to systematically enhance MLLM visual factual consistency. GVF integrates explicit factual signals via three core mechanisms: Factual Anchor Data Augmentation, enriching training data with structured factual anchors and counter-factual prompts; Fact-Aware Instruction Tuning, embedding these cues into explicit instructions; and a Factual Consistency Loss function, specifically penalizing factual inaccuracies. Evaluated on LLaVA-1.5-13B, GVF Finetuning significantly outperforms standard fine-tuning on the VHTest benchmark for both Open-Ended Question (OEQ) and Yes/No Question (YNQ) formats. Crucially, GVF maintains or even slightly improves performance on general multimodal benchmarks like MME and POPE, demonstrating effective mitigation of visual hallucinations without compromising general understanding and reasoning abilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming materials science. This review examines recent LLM applications across the materials discovery pipeline, focusing on three key areas: mining scientific literature , predictive modelling, and multi-agent experimental systems. We highlight how LLMs extract valuable information such as synthesis conditions from text, learn structure-property relationships, and can coordinate agentic systems integrating computational tools and laboratory automation. While progress has been largely dependent on closed-source commercial models, our benchmark results demonstrate that open-source alternatives can match performance while offering greater transparency, reproducibility, cost-effectiveness, and data privacy. As open-source models continue to improve, we advocate their broader adoption to build accessible, flexible, and community-driven AI platforms for scientific discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的上下文学习演示选择方法主要关注测试输入与演示之间的语义相似性，往往忽视了标签分布对齐的重要性，这限制了大型语言模型的性能表现。

Method: 提出两阶段演示选择方法：首先基于语义相似性选择TopK候选演示，然后使用微调的BERT类小型语言模型生成标签分布并计算标签分布散度(L2D)，选择标签分布与测试输入对齐的演示。

Result: 在七个文本分类基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法始终优于先前的演示选择策略。进一步分析显示LLM性能与用于标签分布估计的SLM准确性呈正相关。

Conclusion: 结合语义相似性和标签分布对齐的演示选择方法能显著提升上下文学习性能，且底层SLM的标签分布估计准确性对LLM性能有重要影响。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) for text classification, which uses a few input-label demonstrations to describe a task, has demonstrated impressive performance on large language models (LLMs). However, the selection of in-context demonstrations plays a crucial role and can significantly affect LLMs' performance. Most existing demonstration selection methods primarily focus on semantic similarity between test inputs and demonstrations, often overlooking the importance of label distribution alignment. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage demonstration selection method, TopK + Label Distribution Divergence (L2D), which leverages a fine-tuned BERT-like small language model (SLM) to generate label distributions and calculate their divergence for both test inputs and candidate demonstrations. This enables the selection of demonstrations that are not only semantically similar but also aligned in label distribution with the test input. Extensive experiments across seven text classification benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms previous demonstration selection strategies. Further analysis reveals a positive correlation between the performance of LLMs and the accuracy of the underlying SLMs used for label distribution estimation.

TL;DR: SpiderGen是一个基于LLM的工作流，将传统生命周期评估（LCA）的分类学和方法论与LLM的推理能力和世界知识相结合，用于生成LCA所需的程序信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化和全球变暖主要由温室气体排放引起，这些排放很大程度上来自消费品的生产、使用和处置。因此需要构建工具来评估消费品对环境的影响，生命周期评估（LCA）是其中的关键部分。

Method: 开发了SpiderGen LLM工作流，整合传统LCA分类学和方法论与LLM的推理能力，生成LCA过程信息，并使用真实LCA文档作为基准进行评估。

Result: SpiderGen提供了准确的LCA过程信息，F1分数达到62%。与基线技术相比表现更好，能够以低于1美元的成本在10分钟内生成LCA信息，而传统LCA成本超过25000美元且需要21人天。

Conclusion: SpiderGen具有减少人类努力和成本估算碳影响的潜力，能够高效、低成本地生成LCA过程信息。

Abstract: Investigating the effects of climate change and global warming caused by GHG emissions have been a primary concern worldwide. These emissions are largely contributed to by the production, use and disposal of consumer products. Thus, it is important to build tools to estimate the environmental impact of consumer goods, an essential part of which is conducting Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs). LCAs specify and account for the appropriate processes involved with the production, use, and disposal of the products. We present SpiderGen, an LLM-based workflow which integrates the taxonomy and methodology of traditional LCA with the reasoning capabilities and world knowledge of LLMs to generate the procedural information used for LCA. We additionally evaluate the output of SpiderGen using real-world LCA documents as ground-truth. We find that SpiderGen provides accurate LCA process information that is either fully correct or has minor errors, achieving an F1-Score of 62% across 10 sample data points. We observe that the remaining missed processes and hallucinated errors occur primarily due to differences in detail between LCA documents, as well as differences in the "scope" of which auxiliary processes must also be included. We also demonstrate that SpiderGen performs better than several baselines techniques, such as chain-of-thought prompting and one-shot prompting. Finally, we highlight SpiderGen's potential to reduce the human effort and costs for estimating carbon impact, as it is able to produce LCA process information for less than \$1 USD in under 10 minutes as compared to the status quo LCA, which can cost over \$25000 USD and take up to 21-person days.

Conclusion: 需要通过系统化和基于统计的分析来评估模型攻击，现有基准测试不足以全面评估模型和对齐方法的漏洞。

Abstract: This work aims to investigate how different Large Language Models (LLMs) alignment methods affect the models' responses to prompt attacks. We selected open source models based on the most common alignment methods, namely, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). We conducted a systematic analysis using statistical methods to verify how sensitive the Attack Success Rate (ASR) is when we apply variations to prompts designed to elicit inappropriate content from LLMs. Our results show that even small prompt modifications can significantly change the Attack Success Rate (ASR) according to the statistical tests we run, making the models more or less susceptible to types of attack. Critically, our results demonstrate that running existing 'attack benchmarks' alone may not be sufficient to elicit all possible vulnerabilities of both models and alignment methods. This paper thus contributes to ongoing efforts on model attack evaluation by means of systematic and statistically-based analyses of the different alignment methods and how sensitive their ASR is to prompt variation.

Method: 使用简单的多轮跟进提示评估模型答案变化，通过马尔可夫链分析模型准确率动态，并检验线性探针是否能预测这些变化。

Result: 发现LLM存在显著脆弱性："再想想"提示使Gemini 1.5 Flash在九轮对话中准确率下降约10%；结合语义等价重述问题使Claude 3.5 Haiku准确率下降7.5%；模型准确率动态可用马尔可夫链有效建模，稳定准确率比首轮平均低约8%。

Conclusion: 建立了稳定准确率作为交互环境中鲁棒性的原则性指标，揭示了模型在重复提问下的脆弱性，解决这种不稳定性对于在高风险和交互环境中部署LLM至关重要。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are adopted in an increasingly wide range of applications, user-model interactions have grown in both frequency and scale. Consequently, research has focused on evaluating the robustness of LLMs, an essential quality for real-world tasks. In this paper, we employ simple multi-turn follow-up prompts to evaluate models' answer changes, model accuracy dynamics across turns with Markov chains, and examine whether linear probes can predict these changes. Our results show significant vulnerabilities in LLM robustness: a simple "Think again" prompt led to an approximate 10% accuracy drop for Gemini 1.5 Flash over nine turns, while combining this prompt with a semantically equivalent reworded question caused a 7.5% drop for Claude 3.5 Haiku. Additionally, we find that model accuracy across turns can be effectively modeled using Markov chains, enabling the prediction of accuracy probabilities over time. This allows for estimation of the model's stationary (long-run) accuracy, which we find to be on average approximately 8% lower than its first-turn accuracy for Gemini 1.5 Flash. Our results from a model's hidden states also reveal evidence that linear probes can help predict future answer changes. Together, these results establish stationary accuracy as a principled robustness metric for interactive settings and expose the fragility of models under repeated questioning. Addressing this instability will be essential for deploying LLMs in high-stakes and interactive settings where consistent reasoning is as important as initial accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 递归提示虽能扩展合成数据集生成，但存在偏见放大风险，需要系统研究偏见动态并开发有效缓解策略。

Method: 使用三种互补评估框架：基于规则的模式匹配、基于嵌入的语义相似性和下游任务性能，在三种初始偏见水平和四种缓解策略下进行实验。

Result: 低初始偏见会放大至模型固有偏见水平（+36%），高初始偏见则会衰减（-26%）。对比增强方法在下游任务中显著减少偏见（平均91%），尽管产生更高的嵌入偏见分数。

Conclusion: 语义相似性指标可能与行为公平结果相悖，强调在负责任合成数据生成中需要多维评估。

Abstract: Recursive prompting with large language models enables scalable synthetic dataset generation but introduces the risk of bias amplification. We investigate gender bias dynamics across three generations of recursive text generation using three complementary evaluation frameworks: rule-based pattern matching, embedding-based semantic similarity, and downstream task performance. Experiments with three initial bias levels (0.1, 0.3, 0.6) and four mitigation strategies reveal equilibrium dynamics rather than monotonic amplification. The low initial bias amplifies toward the model's inherent bias level (+36%), whereas the high initial bias decays toward it (-26%). Among mitigation methods, contrastive augmentation, which introduces gender-swapped variants, achieves significant downstream bias reduction (98.8% for low initial bias and 91% on average) despite producing higher embedding-based bias scores. This paradox demonstrates that semantic similarity metrics may diverge from behavioral fairness outcomes, highlighting the need for multidimensional evaluation in responsible synthetic data generation.

Abstract: Recent closed-source multimodal systems have made great advances, but their hidden language for understanding the world remains opaque because of their black-box architectures. In this paper, we use the systems' preference bias to study their hidden language: During the process of compressing the input images (typically containing multiple concepts) into texts and then reconstructing them into images, the systems' inherent preference bias introduces specific shifts in the outputs, disrupting the original input concept co-occurrence. We employ the multi-round "telephone game" to strategically leverage this bias. By observing the co-occurrence frequencies of concepts in telephone games, we quantitatively investigate the concept connection strength in the understanding of multimodal systems, i.e., "hidden language." We also contribute Telescope, a dataset of 10,000+ concept pairs, as the database of our telephone game framework. Our telephone game is test-time scalable: By iteratively running telephone games, we can construct a global map of concept connections in multimodal systems' understanding. Here we can identify preference bias inherited from training, assess generalization capability advancement, and discover more stable pathways for fragile concept connections. Furthermore, we use Reasoning-LLMs to uncover unexpected concept relationships that transcend textual and visual similarities, inferring how multimodal systems understand and simulate the world. This study offers a new perspective on the hidden language of multimodal systems and lays the foundation for future research on the interpretability and controllability of multimodal systems.

Abstract: Contemporary benchmarks are struggling to keep pace with the development of large language models (LLMs). Although they are indispensable to evaluate model performance on various tasks, it is uncertain whether the models trained on Internet data have genuinely learned how to solve problems or merely seen the questions before. This potential data contamination issue presents a fundamental challenge to establishing trustworthy evaluation frameworks. Meanwhile, existing benchmarks predominantly assume benign, resource-rich settings, leaving the behavior of LLMs under pressure unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Squid Game, a dynamic and adversarial evaluation environment with resource-constrained and asymmetric information settings elaborated to evaluate LLMs through interactive gameplay against other LLM opponents. Notably, Squid Game consists of six elimination-style levels, focusing on multi-faceted abilities, such as instruction-following, code, reasoning, planning, and safety alignment. We evaluate over 50 LLMs on Squid Game, presenting the largest behavioral evaluation study of general LLMs on dynamic adversarial scenarios. We observe a clear generational phase transition on performance in the same model lineage and find evidence that some models resort to speculative shortcuts to win the game, indicating the possibility of higher-level evaluation paradigm contamination in static benchmarks. Furthermore, we compare prominent LLM benchmarks and Squid Game with correlation analyses, highlighting that dynamic evaluation can serve as a complementary part for static evaluations. The code and data will be released in the future.

*Eyal Rabin,Zohar Elyoseph,Rotem Israel-Fishelson,Adi Dali,Ravit Nussinson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现AI语音系统能够隐式学习人类社交规范，在礼貌提示下会降低语速，模仿人类通过语速变化表达礼貌的微妙心理特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究最先进的文本转语音系统是否内化了人类通过降低语速来表达礼貌的非明显韵律标记，验证AI能否学习未明确编程的隐式社交线索。

Method: 使用两个领先AI平台（AI Studio和OpenAI）的22个合成声音，在"礼貌正式"和"随意非正式"两种条件下朗读固定脚本，测量语音持续时间。

Result: 两个AI平台的礼貌提示都产生了比随意提示更慢的语速，效应量非常大。AI Studio的所有声音和OpenAI的大多数声音都显示出统计显著性差异。

Conclusion: AI能够隐式学习和复制人类沟通的心理细微差别，突显其作为能够强化人类社交规范的社会行动者的新兴角色。

Abstract: Voice-based artificial intelligence is increasingly expected to adhere to human social conventions, but can it learn implicit cues that are not explicitly programmed? This study investigates whether state-of-the-art text-to-speech systems have internalized the human tendency to reduce speech rate to convey politeness - a non-obvious prosodic marker. We prompted 22 synthetic voices from two leading AI platforms (AI Studio and OpenAI) to read a fixed script under both "polite and formal" and "casual and informal" conditions and measured the resulting speech duration. Across both AI platforms, the polite prompt produced slower speech than the casual prompt with very large effect sizes, an effect that was statistically significant for all of AI Studio's voices and for a large majority of OpenAI's voices. These results demonstrate that AI can implicitly learn and replicate psychological nuances of human communication, highlighting its emerging role as a social actor capable of reinforcing human social norms.

Method: 基于联合国安理会历史记录构建包含三个测试的偏见评估框架，重点关注安理会五个常任理事国。同时提出结合检索增强生成和反思技术的去偏见框架。

Result: 实验结果显示LLMs普遍存在亲西方、反俄罗斯的偏见模式，但偏见程度因模型和任务而异。推理能力更强的模型偏见更小。提出的去偏见框架在GPT-4o-mini和LLama-3.3-70B上有效减少了偏见并提升了性能。

Conclusion: 在国际关系领域应用LLMs时，需要同时评估国家层面偏见和性能表现，以确保模型的公平性和可靠性。

Abstract: This paper systematically examines nation-level biases exhibited by Large Language Models (LLMs) within the domain of International Relations (IR). Leveraging historical records from the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), we developed a bias evaluation framework comprising three distinct tests to explore nation-level bias in various LLMs, with a particular focus on the five permanent members of the UNSC. Experimental results show that, even with the general bias patterns across models (e.g., favorable biases toward the western nations, and unfavorable biases toward Russia), these still vary based on the LLM. Notably, even within the same LLM, the direction and magnitude of bias for a nation change depending on the evaluation context. This observation suggests that LLM biases are fundamentally multidimensional, varying across models and tasks. We also observe that models with stronger reasoning abilities show reduced bias and better performance. Building on this finding, we introduce a debiasing framework that improves LLMs' factual reasoning combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Reflexion-based self-reflection techniques. Experiments show it effectively reduces nation-level bias, and improves performance, particularly in GPT-4o-mini and LLama-3.3-70B. Our findings emphasize the need to assess nation-level bias alongside performance when applying LLMs in the IR domain.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ΠAttention是一种周期性稀疏Transformer，通过环局部注意力、确定性π步长跳跃和自适应融合门来分解注意力机制，在保持线性复杂度的同时扩展感受野，在语言建模等任务中优于RingAttention。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer的二次复杂度限制了长序列建模能力，现有稀疏注意力机制如RingAttention虽然降低了计算成本，但存在感受野有限和缺乏适应性的问题。

Method: 提出ΠAttention，将注意力分解为环局部邻域、确定性π步长跳跃和自适应融合门，周期性结构提供对远距离token的可预测覆盖，稀疏足迹保持每层复杂度与上下文长度线性相关。

Result: ΠAttention在语言建模、检索和视觉语言任务中达到或超过密集注意力的质量，困惑度比RingAttention降低8.3%，相同上下文长度下GPU使用量减少50%。

Conclusion: 周期性跳跃、自适应融合和头级稀疏协调对于高效长上下文建模至关重要，ΠAttention在保持线性复杂度的同时显著扩展了感受野。

Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized natural language processing, but their quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length remains a fundamental bottleneck for long-range modeling. While sparse attention mechanisms like RingAttention reduce computational costs by restricting attention to local neighborhoods, they suffer from limited receptive fields and lack of adaptability. We present \PiAttention, a periodic sparse Transformer that factorizes attention into ring-local neighborhoods, deterministic $π$-stride skips, and an adaptive fusion gate. The periodic structure provides predictable coverage of distant tokens, while the sparse footprint keeps the per-layer complexity linear in context length. We prove that \PiAttention achieves $\mathcal{O}(kL + π\log L)$ receptive field growth compared to $\mathcal{O}(kL)$ for RingAttention, where $k$ is the local window size, $π$ is the skip period, and $L$ is the sequence length. Extensive experiments on language modeling, retrieval, and vision-language tasks demonstrate that \PiAttention matches or surpasses dense attention quality with 8.3\% lower perplexity than RingAttention while using 50\% fewer GPUs for the same context length. Our detailed ablations and visualizations reveal the importance of periodic skips, adaptive fusion, and head-level sparsity coordination for efficient long-context modeling.

Conclusion: 忠实度是可靠医疗摘要的重要维度，该方法展示了在医疗环境中更安全部署大语言模型的潜力。

Abstract: Summarizing consumer health questions (CHQs) can ease communication in healthcare, but unfaithful summaries that misrepresent medical details pose serious risks. We propose a framework that combines TextRank-based sentence extraction and medical named entity recognition with large language models (LLMs) to enhance faithfulness in medical text summarization. In our experiments, we fine-tuned the LLaMA-2-7B model on the MeQSum (English) and BanglaCHQ-Summ (Bangla) datasets, achieving consistent improvements across quality (ROUGE, BERTScore, readability) and faithfulness (SummaC, AlignScore) metrics, and outperforming zero-shot baselines and prior systems. Human evaluation further shows that over 80\% of generated summaries preserve critical medical information. These results highlight faithfulness as an essential dimension for reliable medical summarization and demonstrate the potential of our approach for safer deployment of LLMs in healthcare contexts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored for educational tasks such as grading, yet their alignment with human evaluation in real classrooms remains underexamined. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using an LLM (GPT-4o) to evaluate short-answer quizzes and project reports in an undergraduate Computational Linguistics course. We collect responses from approximately 50 students across five quizzes and receive project reports from 14 teams. LLM-generated scores are compared against human evaluations conducted independently by the course teaching assistants (TAs). Our results show that GPT-4o achieves strong correlation with human graders (up to 0.98) and exact score agreement in 55\% of quiz cases. For project reports, it also shows strong overall alignment with human grading, while exhibiting some variability in scoring technical, open-ended responses. We release all code and sample data to support further research on LLMs in educational assessment. This work highlights both the potential and limitations of LLM-based grading systems and contributes to advancing automated grading in real-world academic settings.

Motivation: 探索多语言大语言模型内部如何表示语言多样性，理解为什么性能仍然偏向主导训练语言，以及是否存在共享的多语言表示与语言特定解码机制。

Method: 训练一系列不同多语言数据混合的LLMs，使用跨层转码器(CLT)和归因图分析内部机制，通过干预语言特征进行实验。

Result: 发现模型采用枢轴语言表示机制，后期层出现语言特定解码，解码依赖少量高频语言特征，这些特征从模型首层线性读取语言身份。通过干预特征可以控制语言输出。

Conclusion: 理解枢轴语言机制对于改进LLMs中的多语言对齐至关重要。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) can process many languages, yet how they internally represent this diversity remains unclear. Do they form shared multilingual representations with language-specific decoding, and if so, why does performance still favor the dominant training language? To address this, we train a series of LLMs on different mixtures of multilingual data and analyze their internal mechanisms using cross-layer transcoders (CLT) and attribution graphs. Our results provide strong evidence for pivot language representations: the model employs nearly identical representations across languages, while language-specific decoding emerges in later layers. Attribution analyses reveal that decoding relies in part on a small set of high-frequency language features in the final layers, which linearly read out language identity from the first layers in the model. By intervening on these features, we can suppress one language and substitute another in the model's outputs. Finally, we study how the dominant training language influences these mechanisms across attribution graphs and decoding pathways. We argue that understanding this pivot-language mechanism is crucial for improving multilingual alignment in LLMs.

Conclusion: 该方法为合并和转移不同LLM家族间的专业技能提供了有效途径，减少了冗余微调并增强了模型适应性。

Abstract: Task arithmetic is a powerful technique for transferring skills between Large Language Models (LLMs), but it often suffers from negative interference when models have diverged during training. We address this limitation by first aligning the models' parameter spaces, leveraging the inherent permutation, rotation, and scaling symmetries of Transformer architectures. We adapt parameter space alignment for modern Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) and SwiGLU layers, exploring both weight-based and activation-based approaches. Using this alignment-first strategy, we successfully transfer advanced reasoning skills to a non-reasoning model. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms standard task arithmetic. This work provides an effective approach for merging and transferring specialized skills across evolving LLM families, reducing redundant fine-tuning and enhancing model adaptability.

Motivation: 探究LLM作为评判者在需要社交或对话判断的任务中是否可靠，特别是当任务从直接事实查询转变为对话判断任务时模型信念的变化。

Method: 通过对比模型在直接事实查询和最小化对话中评估说话者正确性的表现，并施加简单反驳来测试模型在对话压力下维持立场的坚定程度。

Result: 不同模型表现各异：GPT-4o-mini在社交框架下显示奉承倾向，而Llama-8B-Instruct变得过度批判。最小对话上下文就能显著改变模型判断。

Conclusion: 对话框架是LLM评估的关键因素，提出的框架为诊断模型信念提供了可复现方法，有助于开发更可信的对话系统。

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly employed as judges across a variety of tasks, including those involving everyday social interactions. Yet, it remains unclear whether such LLM-judges can reliably assess tasks that require social or conversational judgment. We investigate how an LLM's conviction is changed when a task is reframed from a direct factual query to a Conversational Judgment Task. Our evaluation framework contrasts the model's performance on direct factual queries with its assessment of a speaker's correctness when the same information is presented within a minimal dialogue, effectively shifting the query from "Is this statement correct?" to "Is this speaker correct?". Furthermore, we apply pressure in the form of a simple rebuttal ("The previous answer is incorrect.") to both conditions. This perturbation allows us to measure how firmly the model maintains its position under conversational pressure. Our findings show that while some models like GPT-4o-mini reveal sycophantic tendencies under social framing tasks, others like Llama-8B-Instruct become overly-critical. We observe an average performance change of 9.24% across all models, demonstrating that even minimal dialogue context can significantly alter model judgment, underscoring conversational framing as a key factor in LLM-based evaluation. The proposed framework offers a reproducible methodology for diagnosing model conviction and contributes to the development of more trustworthy dialogue systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous in everyday life and are entering higher-stakes applications ranging from summarizing meeting transcripts to answering doctors' questions. As was the case with earlier predictive models, it is crucial that we develop tools for explaining the output of LLMs, be it a summary, list, response to a question, etc. With these needs in mind, we introduce In-Context Explainability 360 (ICX360), an open-source Python toolkit for explaining LLMs with a focus on the user-provided context (or prompts in general) that are fed to the LLMs. ICX360 contains implementations for three recent tools that explain LLMs using both black-box and white-box methods (via perturbations and gradients respectively). The toolkit, available at https://github.com/IBM/ICX360, contains quick-start guidance materials as well as detailed tutorials covering use cases such as retrieval augmented generation, natural language generation, and jailbreaking.

Abstract: Negative bias refers to the tendency of large language models (LLMs) to excessively generate negative responses in binary decision tasks (e.g., yes-no question answering). Previous research has focused on detecting and addressing negative attention heads that induce negative bias. However, the underlying detailed factors influencing negative bias remain underexplored. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs exhibit format-level negative bias, meaning the prompt format more influences their responses than the semantics of the negative response. For the fine-grained study of the negative bias, we introduce a pipeline for constructing the evaluation set, which systematically categorizes the dataset into three subsets based on the model's parametric knowledge: correct, incorrect, and insufficient relevant knowledge. Through analysis of this evaluation set, we identify a shortcut behavior in which models tend to generate negative responses when they lack sufficient knowledge to answer a yes-no question, leading to negative bias. We further examine how negative bias changes under various prompting scenarios related to parametric knowledge. We observe that providing relevant context and offering an "I don't know" option generally reduces negative bias, whereas chain-of-thought prompting tends to amplify the bias. Finally, we demonstrate that the degree of negative bias can vary depending on the type of prompt, which influences the direction of the response. Our work reveals the various factors that influence negative bias, providing critical insights for mitigating it in LLMs.

Abstract: Progress in biomedical Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Entity Linking (EL) is currently hindered by a fragmented data landscape, a lack of resources for building explainable models, and the limitations of semantically-blind evaluation metrics. To address these challenges, we present MedPath, a large-scale and multi-domain biomedical EL dataset that builds upon nine existing expert-annotated EL datasets. In MedPath, all entities are 1) normalized using the latest version of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), 2) augmented with mappings to 62 other biomedical vocabularies and, crucially, 3) enriched with full ontological paths -- i.e., from general to specific -- in up to 11 biomedical vocabularies. MedPath directly enables new research frontiers in biomedical NLP, facilitating training and evaluation of semantic-rich and interpretable EL systems, and the development of the next generation of interoperable and explainable clinical NLP models.

TL;DR: 研究发现工具增强语言模型（TaLMs）虽然能通过调用外部工具提高最终答案准确率，但会导致推理质量下降，出现工具诱导短视（TIM）现象，即模型将工具输出作为推理替代品而非辅助证据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究工具增强语言模型在调用工具时是否真正进行可信推理，而非仅仅依赖工具输出作为答案替代。

Method: 使用PYMATH基准测试（1,679个竞赛级数学问题），开发多维度评估套件量化推理退化，分析工具使用频率与推理质量的关系，并提出基于偏好优化的框架来改善工具使用方式。

Result: TaLMs最终答案准确率提升19.3个百分点，但推理质量显著下降（非工具LLMs在推理过程比较中胜出41.5%），工具使用越多推理越不连贯，约55%高风险案例出现TIM现象。

Conclusion: 工具使用虽然提高答案准确率，但损害推理质量，需要通过优化框架将工具重新定位为辅助证据而非推理替代品。

Abstract: Tool-augmented Language Models (TaLMs) can invoke external tools to solve problems beyond their parametric capacity. However, it remains unclear whether these tool-enabled gains reflect trustworthy reasoning. Focusing on the Code Interpreter tool, we show that even when tools are selected and executed correctly, TaLMs treat tool outputs as substitutes for reasoning, producing solutions that appear correct but lack coherent justification. We term this failure mode Tool-Induced Myopia (TIM), and study it using PYMATH, a benchmark of 1,679 competition-level mathematical problems for which Python code is helpful but not sufficient. We further develop a multi-dimensional evaluation suite to quantify reasoning degradation in TaLMs relative to their non-tool counterparts. Our findings reveal that while TaLMs achieve up to a 19.3 percentage point gain in final-answer accuracy, their reasoning behavior consistently deteriorates (e.g., non-tool LLMs win up to 41.5% more often in pairwise comparisons of the reasoning process). This degradation intensifies with tool use; the more frequently a model invokes tools, the less coherent its reasoning becomes. Moreover, tool use shifts errors from arithmetic mistakes toward global reasoning failures (logic, assumption, creativity); with TIM present in ~55% of high-risk cases. Finally, we propose a preference-optimization-based framework that realigns TaLMs to use tools as assistive evidence, improving both final-answer accuracy and reasoning depth under tool use.

TL;DR: 本文提出了EMSQA数据集和Expert-CoT、ExpertRAG方法，用于提升大型语言模型在医疗急救领域的问答性能，通过结合临床专业领域和认证级别的结构化知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在医疗问答中忽视了专业领域知识（如临床科目和认证级别），限制了在高风险环境下的表现。

Method: 开发了EMSQA数据集（24.3K问题），并提出Expert-CoT提示策略和ExpertRAG检索增强生成管道，结合特定临床领域和认证级别的专业知识。

Result: Expert-CoT比普通CoT提示提升2.05%，与ExpertRAG结合比标准RAG基线提升4.59%准确率，32B专业增强LLM通过所有EMS认证模拟考试。

Conclusion: 结合结构化专业知识的提示和检索策略能显著提升LLM在医疗急救领域的性能，达到专业认证水平。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical question answering, yet they often overlook the domain-specific expertise that professionals depend on, such as the clinical subject areas (e.g., trauma, airway) and the certification level (e.g., EMT, Paramedic). Existing approaches typically apply general-purpose prompting or retrieval strategies without leveraging this structured context, limiting performance in high-stakes settings. We address this gap with EMSQA, an 24.3K-question multiple-choice dataset spanning 10 clinical subject areas and 4 certification levels, accompanied by curated, subject area-aligned knowledge bases (40K documents and 2M tokens). Building on EMSQA, we introduce (i) Expert-CoT, a prompting strategy that conditions chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning on specific clinical subject area and certification level, and (ii) ExpertRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline that grounds responses in subject area-aligned documents and real-world patient data. Experiments on 4 LLMs show that Expert-CoT improves up to 2.05% over vanilla CoT prompting. Additionally, combining Expert-CoT with ExpertRAG yields up to a 4.59% accuracy gain over standard RAG baselines. Notably, the 32B expertise-augmented LLMs pass all the computer-adaptive EMS certification simulation exams.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前翻译评估方法主要关注句子级准确性和流畅性，而专业领域的翻译需要篇章级连贯性和严格的术语精确性，现有评估方法对此不足。

Method: 引入DiscoX基准，包含7个专业领域的200篇专业文本；开发Metric-S无参考评估系统，提供准确性、流畅性和适当性的细粒度自动评估。

Result: Metric-S与人类判断具有强一致性，显著优于现有指标；实验显示最先进的LLM在DiscoX任务上仍显著落后于人类专家。

Conclusion: DiscoX验证了专业级机器翻译的挑战性，提出的基准和评估系统为更严格的评估提供了稳健框架，促进基于LLM的翻译未来发展。

Abstract: The evaluation of discourse-level translation in expert domains remains inadequate, despite its centrality to knowledge dissemination and cross-lingual scholarly communication. While these translations demand discourse-level coherence and strict terminological precision, current evaluation methods predominantly focus on segment-level accuracy and fluency. To address this limitation, we introduce DiscoX, a new benchmark for discourse-level and expert-level Chinese-English translation. It comprises 200 professionally-curated texts from 7 domains, with an average length exceeding 1700 tokens. To evaluate performance on DiscoX, we also develop Metric-S, a reference-free system that provides fine-grained automatic assessments across accuracy, fluency, and appropriateness. Metric-S demonstrates strong consistency with human judgments, significantly outperforming existing metrics. Our experiments reveal a remarkable performance gap: even the most advanced LLMs still trail human experts on these tasks. This finding validates the difficulty of DiscoX and underscores the challenges that remain in achieving professional-grade machine translation. The proposed benchmark and evaluation system provide a robust framework for more rigorous evaluation, facilitating future advancements in LLM-based translation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DPO数据集缺乏系统性比较，主要由于计算成本高和缺乏质量标注，难以理解偏好选择方式、任务类型覆盖范围以及人类判断的反映程度。

Method: 使用Magpie框架对每个样本进行任务类别、输入质量和偏好奖励的标注，实现可扩展的细粒度偏好质量检查，揭示不同数据集在奖励边际上的结构和质量差异。

Conclusion: 通过数据中心的偏好优化方法，可以构建更高效、性能更好的DPO数据集，为未来数据中心的偏好优化研究提供支持。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) is a central objective of post-training, often achieved through reward modeling and reinforcement learning methods. Among these, direct preference optimization (DPO) has emerged as a widely adopted technique that fine-tunes LLMs on preferred completions over less favorable ones. While most frontier LLMs do not disclose their curated preference pairs, the broader LLM community has released several open-source DPO datasets, including TuluDPO, ORPO, UltraFeedback, HelpSteer, and Code-Preference-Pairs. However, systematic comparisons remain scarce, largely due to the high computational cost and the lack of rich quality annotations, making it difficult to understand how preferences were selected, which task types they span, and how well they reflect human judgment on a per-sample level. In this work, we present the first comprehensive, data-centric analysis of popular open-source DPO corpora. We leverage the Magpie framework to annotate each sample for task category, input quality, and preference reward, a reward-model-based signal that validates the preference order without relying on human annotations. This enables a scalable, fine-grained inspection of preference quality across datasets, revealing structural and qualitative discrepancies in reward margins. Building on these insights, we systematically curate a new DPO mixture, UltraMix, that draws selectively from all five corpora while removing noisy or redundant samples. UltraMix is 30% smaller than the best-performing individual dataset yet exceeds its performance across key benchmarks. We publicly release all annotations, metadata, and our curated mixture to facilitate future research in data-centric preference optimization.

We propose a novel method to enhance diversity in automaton-based structured generation. Our approach utilizes automata traversal history to steer LLMs towards novel structural patterns. Evaluations show our method significantly improves structural and content diversity while maintaining comparable generation efficiency. Furthermore, we conduct a case study showcasing the effectiveness of our method in generating diverse test cases for testing open-source libraries.

*Xingyu Ren,Youran Sun,Haoyu Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文发现当前文本嵌入模型存在一致的偏差，提出了一种无需训练、轻量级的重归一化方法，通过消除嵌入向量中的偏差分量来提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本嵌入模型在输出中存在一致的偏差，即所有句子的嵌入向量都包含一个几乎相同的偏差分量μ，这影响了模型的性能表现。

Method: 提出重归一化方法，有两种变体：直接从嵌入向量e中减去偏差μ，或减去e在μ方向上的投影。该方法无需训练，可直接应用于现有模型。

Result: 在MMTEB基准测试中，重归一化显著提升了38个模型的性能：检索任务提升9.7σ，分类任务提升3.1σ，其他任务提升0.8σ。理论预测和实验均证实投影方法效果更好。

Conclusion: 重归一化是一种有效且通用的方法，能够通过消除嵌入向量中的偏差分量来持续提升文本嵌入模型的性能。

Abstract: We find that current text embedding models produce outputs with a consistent bias, i.e., each embedding vector $e$ can be decomposed as $\tilde{e} + μ$, where $μ$ is almost identical across all sentences. We propose a plug-and-play, training-free and lightweight solution called Renormalization. Through extensive experiments, we show that renormalization consistently and statistically significantly improves the performance of existing models on the Massive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark (MMTEB). In particular, across 38 models, renormalization improves performance by 9.7 $σ$ on retrieval tasks, 3.1 $σ$ on classification tasks, and 0.8 $σ$ on other types of tasks. Renormalization has two variants: directly subtracting $μ$ from $e$, or subtracting the projection of $e$ onto $μ$. We theoretically predict that the latter performs better, and our experiments confirm this prediction.

Motivation: 大语言模型虽然能生成流畅回答，但有时会产生事实幻觉，需要研究模型能否识别自身的幻觉问题。

Method: 将幻觉检测制定为句子分类任务，提出基于思维链的分类方法从模型参数中提取知识。

Result: 实验结果显示GPT-3.5 Turbo结合思维链能检测58.2%的自身幻觉。

Conclusion: 当模型参数包含足够知识时，结合思维链的大语言模型能够有效检测自身幻觉。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can generate fluent responses, but sometimes hallucinate facts. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs can detect their own hallucinations. We formulate hallucination detection as a classification task of a sentence. We propose a framework for estimating LLMs' capability of hallucination detection and a classification method using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to extract knowledge from their parameters. The experimental results indicated that GPT-$3.5$ Turbo with CoT detected $58.2\%$ of its own hallucinations. We concluded that LLMs with CoT can detect hallucinations if sufficient knowledge is contained in their parameters.

Abstract: Personal attacks have become a notable feature of U.S. presidential debates and play an important role in shaping public perception during elections. Detecting such attacks can improve transparency in political discourse and provide insights for journalists, analysts and the public. Advances in deep learning and transformer-based models, particularly BERT and large language models (LLMs) have created new opportunities for automated detection of harmful language. Motivated by these developments, we present a framework for analysing personal attacks in U.S. presidential debates. Our work involves manual annotation of debate transcripts across the 2016, 2020 and 2024 election cycles, followed by statistical and language-model based analysis. We investigate the potential of fine-tuned transformer models alongside general-purpose LLMs to detect personal attacks in formal political speech. This study demonstrates how task-specific adaptation of modern language models can contribute to a deeper understanding of political communication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表情包情感理解方法面临两个主要挑战：缺乏细粒度多模态融合策略，以及对表情包隐含意义和背景知识挖掘不足。

Method: 提出四步文本增强模块利用多模态大语言模型推理提取隐含信息，设计双阶段模态融合策略（浅层融合原始图像文本，深层融合增强特征）。

Result: 在MET-MEME和MOOD数据集上，MemoDetector相比现有最优方法分别提升F1分数4.3%和3.4%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了表情包情感理解中的关键挑战，验证了框架的有效性和鲁棒性，具有推进该领域发展的潜力。

Abstract: With the rapid rise of social media and Internet culture, memes have become a popular medium for expressing emotional tendencies. This has sparked growing interest in Meme Emotion Understanding (MEU), which aims to classify the emotional intent behind memes by leveraging their multimodal contents. While existing efforts have achieved promising results, two major challenges remain: (1) a lack of fine-grained multimodal fusion strategies, and (2) insufficient mining of memes' implicit meanings and background knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose MemoDetector, a novel framework for advancing MEU. First, we introduce a four-step textual enhancement module that utilizes the rich knowledge and reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to progressively infer and extract implicit and contextual insights from memes. These enhanced texts significantly enrich the original meme contents and provide valuable guidance for downstream classification. Next, we design a dual-stage modal fusion strategy: the first stage performs shallow fusion on raw meme image and text, while the second stage deeply integrates the enhanced visual and textual features. This hierarchical fusion enables the model to better capture nuanced cross-modal emotional cues. Experiments on two datasets, MET-MEME and MOOD, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Specifically, MemoDetector improves F1 scores by 4.3\% on MET-MEME and 3.4\% on MOOD. Further ablation studies and in-depth analyses validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, highlighting its strong potential for advancing MEU.

TL;DR: 提出了SAP²方法，一种两阶段动态修剪和整合相关上下文关键词的新框架，用于解决ASR系统在需要领域知识的语境化场景中难以利用长上下文信息的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动语音识别系统在常见条件下表现优异，但在需要领域特定知识的语境化场景（如会议演示）中难以利用长上下文信息，主要由于模型上下文窗口受限和大量上下文噪声中相关信息稀疏。

Method: SAP²方法采用两阶段动态修剪和整合相关上下文关键词，每个阶段利用提出的语音驱动注意力池化机制，有效压缩上下文嵌入同时保留语音显著信息。

Result: 在SlideSpeech和LibriSpeech数据集上实现最先进性能，词错误率分别为7.71%和1.12%。在SlideSpeech上，相比非上下文基线，偏置关键词错误率显著降低41.1%。

Conclusion: SAP²方法在广泛上下文输入条件下在两个数据集上都表现出稳健的可扩展性，持续保持性能。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved remarkable performance in common conditions but often struggle to leverage long-context information in contextualized scenarios that require domain-specific knowledge, such as conference presentations. This challenge arises primarily due to constrained model context windows and the sparsity of relevant information within extensive contextual noise. To solve this, we propose the SAP$^{2}$ method, a novel framework that dynamically prunes and integrates relevant contextual keywords in two stages. Specifically, each stage leverages our proposed Speech-Driven Attention-based Pooling mechanism, enabling efficient compression of context embeddings while preserving speech-salient information. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of SAP$^{2}$ on the SlideSpeech and LibriSpeech datasets, achieving word error rates (WER) of 7.71% and 1.12%, respectively. On SlideSpeech, our method notably reduces biased keyword error rates (B-WER) by 41.1% compared to non-contextual baselines. SAP$^{2}$ also exhibits robust scalability, consistently maintaining performance under extensive contextual input conditions on both datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于语言学理论、经过实证验证的副词超义类型学，扩展了WordNet对副词的语义分类覆盖，并展示了该分类在自然文本中的广泛适用性和可标注性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WordNet为名词和动词提供了丰富的超义层次结构，但副词缺乏系统的语义分类，这限制了其在自然语言处理应用中的使用。

Method: 引入基于语言学的副词超义类型学，通过标注研究进行实证验证，涵盖方式、时间、频率、程度、领域、说话者导向和主语导向等主要语义域。

Result: 试点标注研究表明，这些类别能够广泛覆盖自然文本中的副词，并且人类标注者能够可靠地分配这些类别。

Conclusion: 该类型学扩展了WordNet的覆盖范围，使其更贴近语言学理论，并促进了词义消歧、事件抽取、情感分析和话语建模等下游NLP应用。

Abstract: WordNet offers rich supersense hierarchies for nouns and verbs, yet adverbs remain underdeveloped, lacking a systematic semantic classification. We introduce a linguistically grounded supersense typology for adverbs, empirically validated through annotation, that captures major semantic domains including manner, temporal, frequency, degree, domain, speaker-oriented, and subject-oriented functions. Results from a pilot annotation study demonstrate that these categories provide broad coverage of adverbs in natural text and can be reliably assigned by human annotators. Incorporating this typology extends WordNet's coverage, aligns it more closely with linguistic theory, and facilitates downstream NLP applications such as word sense disambiguation, event extraction, sentiment analysis, and discourse modeling. We present the proposed supersense categories, annotation outcomes, and directions for future work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LANE是一种对抗性训练策略，通过选择性标记训练集中的替代词来生成具有挑战性的负训练样本，迫使模型在具有不同标记词的相同句子之间创建更大的可分离性，从而提高词义分辨能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经语言模型在细粒度词义解析方面存在挑战，因为它们往往过度拟合全局句子表示，无法捕捉局部语义细节。需要一种方法来增强模型对目标词的学习关注。

Method: 提出LANE对抗训练策略，通过选择性标记训练集中的替代词生成负训练样本，迫使模型在相同句子但不同标记词的情况下学习更好的词表示分离性。

Result: 在词汇语义变化检测和词义消歧基准测试中，该方法产生了更具区分性的词表示，性能优于标准对比学习基线。定性分析显示该方法能更好捕捉挑战环境中的细微意义差异。

Conclusion: LANE方法能够有效提高词表示的区分性，模型无关且可集成到现有表示学习框架中，为解决细粒度词义解析问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Fine-grained word meaning resolution remains a critical challenge for neural language models (NLMs) as they often overfit to global sentence representations, failing to capture local semantic details. We propose a novel adversarial training strategy, called LANE, to address this limitation by deliberately shifting the model's learning focus to the target word. This method generates challenging negative training examples through the selective marking of alternate words in the training set. The goal is to force the model to create a greater separability between same sentences with different marked words. Experimental results on lexical semantic change detection and word sense disambiguation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach yields more discriminative word representations, improving performance over standard contrastive learning baselines. We further provide qualitative analyses showing that the proposed negatives lead to representations that better capture subtle meaning differences even in challenging environments. Our method is model-agnostic and can be integrated into existing representation learning frameworks.

Result: 实验证明该混合方法能高效生成高质量的问答对，兼具可扩展性、流畅性和语言精确性。

Conclusion: 提出的混合流水线成功解决了知识图谱问答生成中的关键挑战，实现了可扩展性和语言质量的平衡。

Abstract: The generation of questions and answers (QA) from knowledge graphs (KG) plays a crucial role in the development and testing of educational platforms, dissemination tools, and large language models (LLM). However, existing approaches often struggle with scalability, linguistic quality, and factual consistency. This paper presents a scalable and deterministic pipeline for generating natural language QA from KGs, with an additional refinement step using LLMs to further enhance linguistic quality. The approach first clusters KG triplets based on their relations, creating reusable templates through natural language rules derived from the entity types of objects and relations. A module then leverages LLMs to refine these templates, improving clarity and coherence while preserving factual accuracy. Finally, the instantiation of answer options is achieved through a selection strategy that introduces distractors from the KG. Our experiments demonstrate that this hybrid approach efficiently generates high-quality QA pairs, combining scalability with fluency and linguistic precision.

Method: iMAD首先让单个智能体生成结构化自我批评响应，从中提取41个可解释的语言和语义特征，然后使用轻量级辩论决策分类器决定是否触发多智能体辩论。

Result: 在六个视觉问答数据集上的实验表明，iMAD显著减少了令牌使用量（最多92%），同时提高了最终答案准确性（最多13.5%）。

Conclusion: iMAD通过智能选择性地触发多智能体辩论，实现了计算效率和准确性的双重提升，是一个有效的多智能体辩论优化框架。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agent systems have advanced rapidly, driven by their strong generalization in zero-shot settings. To further enhance reasoning and accuracy on complex tasks, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as a promising framework that engages multiple LLM agents in structured debates to encourage diverse reasoning. However, triggering MAD for every query is inefficient, as it incurs substantial computational (token) cost and may even degrade accuracy by overturning correct single-agent answers. To address these limitations, we propose intelligent Multi-Agent Debate (iMAD), a token-efficient framework that selectively triggers MAD only when it is likely to be beneficial (i.e., correcting an initially wrong answer). To achieve this goal, iMAD learns generalizable model behaviors to make accurate debate decisions. Specifically, iMAD first prompts a single agent to produce a structured self-critique response, from which we extract 41 interpretable linguistic and semantic features capturing hesitation cues. Then, iMAD uses a lightweight debate-decision classifier, trained using our proposed FocusCal loss, to determine whether to trigger MAD, enabling robust debate decisions without test dataset-specific tuning. Through extensive experiments using six (visual) question answering datasets against five competitive baselines, we have shown that iMAD significantly reduces token usage (by up to 92%) while also improving final answer accuracy (by up to 13.5%).

Abstract: Advancements in Machine Learning & Neural Networks in recent years have led to widespread implementations of Natural Language Processing across a variety of fields with remarkable success, solving a wide range of complicated problems. However, recent research has shown that machine learning models may be vulnerable in a number of ways, putting both the models and the systems theyre used in at risk. In this paper, we intend to analyze and experiment with the best of existing adversarial attack recipes and create new ones. We concentrated on developing a novel adversarial attack strategy on current state-of-the-art machine learning models by producing ambiguous inputs for the models to confound them and then constructing the path to the future development of the robustness of the models. We will develop adversarial instances with maximum perplexity, utilizing machine learning and deep learning approaches in order to trick the models. In our attack recipe, we will analyze several datasets and focus on creating obfuscous adversary examples to put the models in a state of perplexity, and by including the Bangla Language in the field of adversarial attacks. We strictly uphold utility usage reduction and efficiency throughout our work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有金融大语言模型（如BloombergGPT、FinMA）计算需求高，限制了组织可及性，需要开发更高效的模型部署方法。

Method: LAET策略分析隐藏状态表示，选择性微调预训练LLM中最有效的层，同时冻结不太关键的层，显著减少计算开销。

Result: 在金融NLP任务中表现出色，超越了现有基准和最先进LLM（如GPT-4），即使使用较小的LLM（约30亿参数）也能实现。

Conclusion: 该工作弥合了前沿金融NLP研究与实际部署之间的差距，为金融应用提供了高效可扩展的模型解决方案。

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) has transformed the financial industry, enabling advancements in areas such as textual analysis, risk management, and forecasting. Large language models (LLMs) like BloombergGPT and FinMA have set new benchmarks across various financial NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, stock movement prediction, and credit risk assessment. Furthermore, FinMA-ES, a bilingual financial LLM, has also demonstrated strong performance using the FLARE and FLARE-ES benchmarks. However, the high computational demands of these models limit the accessibility of many organizations. To address this, we propose Layer-wise Adaptive Ensemble Tuning (LAET), a novel strategy that selectively fine-tunes the most effective layers of pre-trained LLMs by analyzing hidden state representations while freezing less critical layers. LAET significantly reduces computational overhead while enhancing task-specific performance. Our approach shows strong results in financial NLP tasks, outperforming existing benchmarks and state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4, even with smaller LLMs ($\sim$3B parameters). This work bridges cutting-edge financial NLP research and real-world deployment with efficient and scalable models for financial applications.

Abstract: The generation of highly fluent text by Large Language Models (LLMs) poses a significant challenge to information integrity and academic research. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Domain Detection of AI-Generated Text (M-DAIGT) shared task, which focuses on detecting AI-generated text across multiple domains, particularly in news articles and academic writing. M-DAIGT comprises two binary classification subtasks: News Article Detection (NAD) (Subtask 1) and Academic Writing Detection (AWD) (Subtask 2). To support this task, we developed and released a new large-scale benchmark dataset of 30,000 samples, balanced between human-written and AI-generated texts. The AI-generated content was produced using a variety of modern LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) and diverse prompting strategies. A total of 46 unique teams registered for the shared task, of which four teams submitted final results. All four teams participated in both Subtask 1 and Subtask 2. We describe the methods employed by these participating teams and briefly discuss future directions for M-DAIGT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型与人类婴儿在语言学习能力上的差异，特别是对自然语言和不可能语言的学习表现。

Method: 回顾文献分析语言模型对自然语言和不可能语言的学习表现，比较其与人类婴儿的差异。

Result: 语言模型通常能同样好地学习自然语言和许多不可能语言，难以学习的不可能语言只是更复杂或随机。

Conclusion: 语言模型缺乏支持语言习得的人类归纳偏置，这是其与人类婴儿语言学习能力的关键差异。

Abstract: According to Futrell and Mahowald [arXiv:2501.17047], both infants and language models (LMs) find attested languages easier to learn than impossible languages that have unnatural structures. We review the literature and show that LMs often learn attested and many impossible languages equally well. Difficult to learn impossible languages are simply more complex (or random). LMs are missing human inductive biases that support language acquisition.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种主动式听力助手系统，能够自动识别和分离佩戴者的对话伙伴，无需显式提示。系统基于自我语音作为锚点，利用对话轮换行为和动态来推断对话伙伴并抑制其他声音。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够主动适应对话动态和参与度的听力助手，使其能够自动识别对话伙伴而无需用户明确指示。

Method: 采用双模型架构：轻量级流式模型每12.5毫秒运行一次用于低延迟提取对话伙伴，较慢模型运行频率较低以捕捉长程对话动态。系统基于自我语音作为锚点，利用对话轮换行为和动态。

Result: 在真实世界的2人和3人对话测试集上（来自11名参与者的6.8小时双耳自我中心音频数据）显示，系统能够在多对话环境中有效识别和隔离对话伙伴。

Conclusion: 这项工作是朝着能够主动适应对话动态和参与度的听力助手迈出的一步，展示了在真实多对话环境中的泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce proactive hearing assistants that automatically identify and separate the wearer's conversation partners, without requiring explicit prompts. Our system operates on egocentric binaural audio and uses the wearer's self-speech as an anchor, leveraging turn-taking behavior and dialogue dynamics to infer conversational partners and suppress others. To enable real-time, on-device operation, we propose a dual-model architecture: a lightweight streaming model runs every 12.5 ms for low-latency extraction of the conversation partners, while a slower model runs less frequently to capture longer-range conversational dynamics. Results on real-world 2- and 3-speaker conversation test sets, collected with binaural egocentric hardware from 11 participants totaling 6.8 hours, show generalization in identifying and isolating conversational partners in multi-conversation settings. Our work marks a step toward hearing assistants that adapt proactively to conversational dynamics and engagement.

TL;DR: PRBench是一个针对金融和法律领域的专业推理基准测试，包含1,100个专家编写的任务和19,356个专家制定的评分标准，是最大的公开基准测试。评估20个领先模型显示在专业推理方面仍有很大改进空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的学术基准测试在衡量模型在现实世界专业环境中的表现方面存在局限，特别是在法律和金融等高风险领域，需要评估开放式、具有经济影响的任务。

Method: 开发PRBench基准测试，招募182名合格专业人士（持有JD、CFA或6年以上经验）编写基于实际工作流程的任务，涵盖114个国家和47个美国司法管辖区，并通过独立专家验证的质量管道验证评分标准。

Result: 评估20个领先模型显示，在困难子集上的最高得分仅为0.39（金融）和0.37（法律）。模型在具体能力上存在显著差异，常见失败模式包括判断不准确、缺乏过程透明度和推理不完整。

Conclusion: 当前模型在专业推理方面仍有重大改进空间，特别是在准确性、透明度和完整性方面，限制了其在专业领域的可靠采用。

Abstract: Frontier model progress is often measured by academic benchmarks, which offer a limited view of performance in real-world professional contexts. Existing evaluations often fail to assess open-ended, economically consequential tasks in high-stakes domains like Legal and Finance, where practical returns are paramount. To address this, we introduce Professional Reasoning Bench (PRBench), a realistic, open-ended, and difficult benchmark of real-world problems in Finance and Law. We open-source its 1,100 expert-authored tasks and 19,356 expert-curated criteria, making it, to our knowledge, the largest public, rubric-based benchmark for both legal and finance domains. We recruit 182 qualified professionals, holding JDs, CFAs, or 6+ years of experience, who contributed tasks inspired by their actual workflows. This process yields significant diversity, with tasks spanning 114 countries and 47 US jurisdictions. Our expert-curated rubrics are validated through a rigorous quality pipeline, including independent expert validation. Subsequent evaluation of 20 leading models reveals substantial room for improvement, with top scores of only 0.39 (Finance) and 0.37 (Legal) on our Hard subsets. We further catalog associated economic impacts of the prompts and analyze performance using human-annotated rubric categories. Our analysis shows that models with similar overall scores can diverge significantly on specific capabilities. Common failure modes include inaccurate judgments, a lack of process transparency and incomplete reasoning, highlighting critical gaps in their reliability for professional adoption.
