*Lionel Wong,Katherine M. Collins,Lance Ying,Cedegao E. Zhang,Adrian Weller,Tobias Gersternberg,Timothy O'Donnell,Alexander K. Lew,Jacob D. Andreas,Joshua B. Tenenbaum,Tyler Brooke-Wilson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合分布式与符号表示的'模型合成架构'（MSA），用于模拟人类在新情境中的推理能力，并通过实验验证其优于纯语言模型基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类如何在新情境中整合广泛背景知识进行推理，并提出计算模型以模拟这一能力。

Method: 提出MSA架构，结合语言模型（全局检索与合成）和概率程序（定制化世界模型），并在'Model Olympics'数据集上评估。

Result: MSA在模拟人类判断上优于纯语言模型，支持其在开放领域推理中的有效性。

Conclusion: MSA为理解和复制人类开放领域推理提供了可行路径。

Abstract: When faced with novel situations, people are able to marshal relevant
considerations from a wide range of background knowledge and put these to use
in inferences and predictions. What permits us to draw in globally relevant
information and reason over it coherently? Here, we explore the hypothesis that
people use a combination of distributed and symbolic representations to
construct bespoke mental models tailored to novel situations. We propose a
computational implementation of this idea -- a ``Model Synthesis Architecture''
(MSA) -- using language models to implement global relevance-based retrieval
and model synthesis and probabilistic programs to implement bespoke, coherent
world models. We evaluate our MSA as a model of human judgments on a novel
reasoning dataset. The dataset -- built around a `Model Olympics` domain of
sports vignettes -- tests models' capacity for human-like, open-ended reasoning
by requiring (i) judgments about novel causal structures described in language;
(ii) drawing on large bodies of background knowledge; and (iii) doing both in
light of observations that introduce arbitrary novel variables. Our MSA
approach captures human judgments better than language model-only baselines,
under both direct and chain-of-thought generations from the LM that supports
model synthesis. These results suggest that MSAs can be implemented in a way
that mirrors people's ability to deliver locally coherent reasoning over
globally relevant variables, offering a path to understanding and replicating
human reasoning in open-ended domains.

### [2] [Is This Just Fantasy? Language Model Representations Reflect Human Judgments of Event Plausibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12553)
*Michael A. Lepori,Jennifer Hu,Ishita Dasgupta,Roma Patel,Thomas Serre,Ellie Pavlick*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现语言模型（LMs）能够通过模态差异向量更可靠地分类句子模态，且这些向量与人类分类行为相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LMs是否能够准确分类句子模态，并揭示其与人类模态分类的潜在联系。

Method: 识别和分析LMs中的模态差异向量，研究其与模型能力的关系，并与人类分类行为对比。

Result: LMs的模态分类能力优于先前研究，模态差异向量与人类分类行为高度相关。

Conclusion: 模态差异向量为理解LMs和人类模态分类提供了新视角。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are used for a diverse range of tasks, from question
answering to writing fantastical stories. In order to reliably accomplish these
tasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e.,
whether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely
nonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the
ability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,
2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that
discriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal
difference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have
access to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously
reported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a
consistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,
layers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors
identified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human
categorization behavior. This potentially provides a novel view into how human
participants distinguish between modal categories, which we explore by
correlating projections along modal difference vectors with human participants'
ratings of interpretable features. In summary, we derive new insights into LM
modal categorization using techniques from mechanistic interpretability, with
the potential to inform our understanding of modal categorization in humans.

### [4] [Improving Drug Identification in Overdose Death Surveillance using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12679)
*Arthur J. Funnell,Panayiotis Petousis,Fabrice Harel-Canada,Ruby Romero,Alex A. T. Bui,Adam Koncsol,Hritika Chaturvedi,Chelsea Shover,David Goodman-Meza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何利用自然语言处理（NLP）模型，特别是经过微调的BioClinicalBERT，来自动化并提高美国药物过量死亡的监测效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 美国药物过量死亡率的上升，尤其是芬太尼相关的死亡，需要及时准确的监测。现有的ICD-10编码方式存在延迟和信息丢失的问题。

Method: 研究使用了35,433份2020年的死亡记录进行模型训练和内部测试，并在2023-2024年的3,335份记录上进行外部验证。评估了多种NLP方法，包括传统分类器和微调的语言模型（如BERT、BioClinicalBERT、Qwen 3和Llama 3）。

Result: 微调的BioClinicalBERT模型在内部测试集上表现近乎完美（宏F1分数≥0.998），外部验证也显示出稳健性（宏F1=0.966），优于其他方法。

Conclusion: NLP模型，尤其是BioClinicalBERT，能够高效准确地从自由文本中分类药物过量死亡，显著加速监测流程，支持实时检测新兴药物使用趋势。

Abstract: The rising rate of drug-related deaths in the United States, largely driven
by fentanyl, requires timely and accurate surveillance. However, critical
overdose data are often buried in free-text coroner reports, leading to delays
and information loss when coded into ICD (International Classification of
Disease)-10 classifications. Natural language processing (NLP) models may
automate and enhance overdose surveillance, but prior applications have been
limited. A dataset of 35,433 death records from multiple U.S. jurisdictions in
2020 was used for model training and internal testing. External validation was
conducted using a novel separate dataset of 3,335 records from 2023-2024.
Multiple NLP approaches were evaluated for classifying specific drug
involvement from unstructured death certificate text. These included
traditional single- and multi-label classifiers, as well as fine-tuned
encoder-only language models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (BERT) and BioClinicalBERT, and contemporary decoder-only large
language models such as Qwen 3 and Llama 3. Model performance was assessed
using macro-averaged F1 scores, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to
quantify uncertainty. Fine-tuned BioClinicalBERT models achieved near-perfect
performance, with macro F1 scores >=0.998 on the internal test set. External
validation confirmed robustness (macro F1=0.966), outperforming conventional
machine learning, general-domain BERT models, and various decoder-only large
language models. NLP models, particularly fine-tuned clinical variants like
BioClinicalBERT, offer a highly accurate and scalable solution for overdose
death classification from free-text reports. These methods can significantly
accelerate surveillance workflows, overcoming the limitations of manual ICD-10
coding and supporting near real-time detection of emerging substance use
trends.

### [5] [AdaptiSent: Context-Aware Adaptive Attention for Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12695)
*S M Rafiuddin,Sadia Kamal,Mohammed Rakib,Arunkumar Bagavathi,Atriya Sen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaptiSent是一种新的多模态基于方面的情感分析框架，通过自适应跨模态注意力机制提升情感分类和方面词提取的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理多模态数据时难以捕捉文本和图像之间的复杂关系，AdaptiSent旨在通过动态模态加权和上下文自适应注意力解决这一问题。

Method: 采用自适应跨模态注意力机制，动态调整模态权重，结合文本和视觉上下文信息。

Result: 在标准Twitter数据集上，AdaptiSent在精确率、召回率和F1分数上优于现有模型，尤其在捕捉模态间细微关系方面表现突出。

Conclusion: AdaptiSent为多模态基于方面的情感分析设定了新标准，显著提升了复杂多模态信息的理解能力。

Abstract: We introduce AdaptiSent, a new framework for Multimodal Aspect-Based
Sentiment Analysis (MABSA) that uses adaptive cross-modal attention mechanisms
to improve sentiment classification and aspect term extraction from both text
and images. Our model integrates dynamic modality weighting and
context-adaptive attention, enhancing the extraction of sentiment and
aspect-related information by focusing on how textual cues and visual context
interact. We tested our approach against several baselines, including
traditional text-based models and other multimodal methods. Results from
standard Twitter datasets show that AdaptiSent surpasses existing models in
precision, recall, and F1 score, and is particularly effective in identifying
nuanced inter-modal relationships that are crucial for accurate sentiment and
aspect term extraction. This effectiveness comes from the model's ability to
adjust its focus dynamically based on the context's relevance, improving the
depth and accuracy of sentiment analysis across various multimodal data sets.
AdaptiSent sets a new standard for MABSA, significantly outperforming current
methods, especially in understanding complex multimodal information.

### [6] [AudioJudge: Understanding What Works in Large Audio Model Based Speech Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12705)
*Potsawee Manakul,Woody Haosheng Gan,Michael J. Ryan,Ali Sartaz Khan,Warit Sirichotedumrong,Kunat Pipatanakul,William Held,Diyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出AudioJudge，利用大型音频模型（LAM）作为统一评估框架，解决现有语音评估的局限性，包括音频特性检测和人类偏好模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音评估存在两个关键问题：设计针对特定音频特性的系统困难，以及自动评估方法与人类偏好相关性差。

Method: 通过音频拼接和上下文学习优化提示工程策略，并引入多角度集成AudioJudge，将语音评估分解为词汇内容、语音质量和副语言特征的专业评判。

Result: 在系统排名基准测试中，多角度集成AudioJudge与人类偏好的Spearman相关性达到0.91。

Conclusion: LAM在噪声环境下表现稳健，但存在冗长和位置偏差问题，需进一步优化。

Abstract: Current speech evaluation suffers from two critical limitations: the need and
difficulty of designing specialized systems targeting individual audio
characteristics, and poor correlation between automatic evaluation methods and
human preferences. This work presents a systematic study of Large Audio Model
(LAM) as a Judge, AudioJudge, investigating whether it can provide a unified
evaluation framework that addresses both challenges. We systematically explore
AudioJudge across audio characteristic detection tasks, including
pronunciation, speaking rate, speaker identification and speech quality, and
system-level human preference simulation for automated benchmarking. We
investigate different prompt engineering strategies, finding that audio
concatenation combined with in-context learning significantly improves
performance across both audio characteristic detection and human preference
simulation tasks. We further introduce a multi-aspect ensemble AudioJudge to
enable general-purpose multi-aspect audio evaluation. This method decomposes
speech assessment into specialized judges for lexical content, speech quality,
and paralinguistic features, achieving up to 0.91 Spearman correlation with
human preferences on our system ranking benchmark. Robustness analysis reveals
that while LAMs maintain strong performance under acoustic noise, they exhibit
significant verbosity and positional biases that require careful mitigation.

### [7] [FLEXITOKENS: Flexible Tokenization for Evolving Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12720)
*Abraham Toluase Owodunni,Orevaoghene Ahia,Sachin Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出FLEXITOKENS，一种可学习的字节级语言模型分词方法，通过简化训练目标提高适应性，减少分词碎片化，并在多语言和多领域任务中表现优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言模型的子词分词器在适应新数据分布时表现僵化，导致分词效率低下和碎片化问题。

Method: 开发字节级语言模型，引入可学习的分词器，提出FLEXITOKENS简化训练目标，提高分词灵活性。

Result: 在多语言基准测试和形态多样任务中，FLEXITOKENS显著减少分词碎片化，下游任务性能提升高达10%。

Conclusion: FLEXITOKENS通过自适应分词器解决了传统方法的僵化问题，提升了语言模型的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are challenging to adapt to new data distributions by
simple finetuning. This is due to the rigidity of their subword tokenizers,
which typically remain unchanged during adaptation. This inflexibility often
leads to inefficient tokenization, causing overfragmentation of
out-of-distribution domains, unseen languages, or scripts. In this work, we
develop byte-level LMs with learnable tokenizers to make tokenization adaptive.
Our models include a submodule that learns to predict boundaries between the
input byte sequence, encoding it into variable-length segments. Existing
tokenizer-free methods train this boundary predictor using an auxiliary loss
that enforces a fixed compression rate across the training corpus, introducing
a new kind of rigidity. We propose FLEXITOKENS, a simplified training objective
that enables significantly greater flexibility during adaptation. Evaluating
across multiple multilingual benchmarks, morphologically diverse tasks, and
domains, we demonstrate that FLEXITOKENS consistently reduces token
over-fragmentation and achieves up to 10\% improvements on downstream task
performance compared to subword and other gradient-based tokenizers. Code and
data for our experiments will be released at

### [8] [TransEvalnia: Reasoning-based Evaluation and Ranking of Translations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12724)
*Richard Sproat,Tianyu Zhao,Llion Jones*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TransEvalnia是一个基于提示的翻译评估和排名系统，通过推理进行细粒度评估，性能优于现有技术，并与人类评分高度一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够提供细粒度翻译评估和排名的系统，以改进现有翻译评估方法。

Method: 使用多维质量指标子集，结合Claude-3.5-Sonnet和Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct等LLM进行推理评估。

Result: TransEvalnia在多种语言对上表现优于MT-Ranker，评分与人类评分高度相关，但存在位置偏差问题。

Conclusion: TransEvalnia是一个有效的翻译评估工具，需进一步解决位置偏差问题。

Abstract: We present TransEvalnia, a prompting-based translation evaluation and ranking
system that uses reasoning in performing its evaluations and ranking. This
system presents fine-grained evaluations based on a subset of the
Multidimensional Quality Metrics (https://themqm.org/), returns an assessment
of which translation it deems the best, and provides numerical scores for the
various dimensions and for the overall translation. We show that TransEvalnia
performs as well as or better than the state-of-the-art MT-Ranker (Moosa et al.
2024) on our own English-Japanese data as well as several language pairs from
various WMT shared tasks. Using Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet and
Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct as the evaluation LLMs, we show that the evaluations
returned are deemed highly acceptable to human raters, and that the scores
assigned to the translations by Sonnet, as well as other LLMs, correlate well
with scores assigned by the human raters. We also note the sensitivity of our
system -- as well as MT-Ranker -- to the order in which the translations are
presented, and we propose methods to address this position bias. All data,
including the system's evaluation and reasoning, human assessments, as well as
code is released.

### [9] [Strategy Adaptation in Large Language Model Werewolf Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12732)
*Fuya Nakamori,Yin Jou Huang,Fei Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种基于玩家态度和对话上下文切换策略的方法，提升狼人杀智能体的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示工程的狼人杀智能体无法适应动态变化的情境。

Method: 显式选择适合的策略，基于游戏上下文和玩家角色估计。

Result: 相比隐式或固定策略的基线智能体，策略适应智能体表现更优。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升了狼人杀智能体的适应性和表现。

Abstract: This study proposes a method to improve the performance of Werewolf agents by
switching between predefined strategies based on the attitudes of other players
and the context of conversations. While prior works of Werewolf agents using
prompt engineering have employed methods where effective strategies are
implicitly defined, they cannot adapt to changing situations. In this research,
we propose a method that explicitly selects an appropriate strategy based on
the game context and the estimated roles of other players. We compare the
strategy adaptation Werewolf agents with baseline agents using implicit or
fixed strategies and verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.

### [10] [Logit Arithmetic Elicits Long Reasoning Capabilities Without Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12759)
*Yunxiang Zhang,Muhammad Khalifa,Lechen Zhang,Xin Liu,Ayoung Lee,Xinliang Frederick Zhang,Farima Fatahi Bayat,Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ThinkLogit和ThinkLogit-DPO是解码时方法，通过小模型引导大模型进行长链推理，无需额外训练即可提升推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究是否能在不进行额外训练的情况下，激发大模型的长链推理能力。

Method: 提出ThinkLogit方法，利用对数运算调整大模型推理，并通过小模型引导；进一步提出ThinkLogit-DPO，通过偏好优化训练引导模型。

Result: 在四个数学数据集上，ThinkLogit和ThinkLogit-DPO分别相对提升26%和29%的pass@1性能。

Conclusion: ThinkLogit是一种计算高效的方法，能够以最小或无需额外训练的方式激发大模型的长链推理能力。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) can do complex reasoning via long
chain-of-thought (CoT) involving cognitive strategies such as backtracking and
self-correction. Recent studies suggest that some models inherently possess
these long reasoning abilities, which may be unlocked via extra training. Our
work first investigates whether we can elicit such behavior without any
training. To this end, we propose a decoding-time approach, ThinkLogit, which
utilizes logits arithmetic (Liu et al., 2024) to tune a target large LM for
long reasoning using a substantially smaller model as guider. We then show that
we can further boost performance by training the guider model with preference
optimization over correct/incorrect reasoning pairs sampled from both the
target and guider model -- a setup we refer to as ThinkLogit-DPO. Our
experiments demonstrate that ThinkLogit and ThinkLogit-DPO achieve a relative
improvement in pass@1 by 26% and 29%, respectively, over four mathematical
datasets using the Qwen2.5-32B when guided by R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B -- a model
21x smaller. Lastly, we show that ThinkLogit can transfer long reasoning skills
acquired through reinforcement learning, improving pass@1 by 13% relative
compared to the Qwen2.5-32B base model. Our work presents a
computationally-efficient method to elicit long reasoning in large models with
minimal or no additional training.

### [11] [Synergy: End-to-end Concept Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12769)
*Keli Zheng,Zerong Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Synergy是一种语言模型，通过学习的路由机制桥接不同抽象层次，在字节级别训练，自发学习字节标记化，性能与BBPE相当但概念标记更少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索无需显式标记器的架构，实现更灵活和鲁棒的模型。

Method: 在字节级别训练语言模型，使用学习路由机制桥接不同抽象层次。

Result: 与Llama3相比，Synergy在相同规模和数据集下表现更优；去除位置编码后，模型中间部分表现更好。

Conclusion: Synergy展示了无需标记器的架构的可行性，为更灵活和鲁棒的模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: In this paper, we present Synergy, a language model that bridges different
levels of abstraction in an end-to-end fashion through a learned routing
mechanism. Focusing on low-level linguistic abstraction, we trained our model
as a byte-level language model. Our model spontaneously learns to tokenize
bytes, producing fewer concept tokens than Byte-level Byte Pair Encoder (BBPE)
tokenizers while keeping comparable performance. By comparing with Llama3, we
observed an advantage of Synergy under the same model scale and training
dataset size. Further studies show that the middle part (the higher abstraction
part) of our model performs better when positional encodings are removed,
suggesting the emergence of position-independent concepts. These findings
demonstrate the feasibility of tokenizer-free architectures, paving the way for
more robust and flexible pipelines.

### [12] [Learning Robust Negation Text Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12782)
*Thinh Hung Truong,Karin Verspoor,Trevor Cohn,Timothy Baldwin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过从大语言模型中提取数据来增强文本编码器对否定和模糊表达的鲁棒性的方法，并在BERT模型上取得了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管自回归大语言模型快速普及，但小型文本编码器在需要丰富上下文表示的任务中仍很重要。否定语义功能未被现有方法充分捕捉，影响依赖文本嵌入的下游应用。

Method: 利用大语言模型生成多样化的否定和模糊表达数据，采用对比学习策略微调BERT模型。

Result: 显著提升了否定理解能力，同时在通用基准测试中保持竞争力。该方法也可应用于大语言模型，提升其在否定基准测试中的表现。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升了文本编码器对否定语义的鲁棒性，且具有通用性。

Abstract: Despite rapid adoption of autoregressive large language models, smaller text
encoders still play an important role in text understanding tasks that require
rich contextualized representations. Negation is an important semantic function
that is still not properly captured by such methods, affecting many downstream
applications relying on text embeddings. We propose a strategy to improve
negation robustness of text encoders, by distilling data from large language
models using diverse patterns of negation and hedging. We adopt a standard
contrastive learning strategy to finetune a strong BERT-based model, and
observe large improvement in negation understanding capabilities while
maintaining competitive performance on general benchmarks. In addition, we also
show that our method can be adapted to LLMs, leading to improved performance on
negation benchmarks.

### [13] [Large Language Models' Internal Perception of Symbolic Music](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12808)
*Andrew Shin,Kunitake Kaneko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs能够从文本中推断基本的音乐结构和时间关系，展示了其在符号音乐生成中的潜力，但也揭示了缺乏明确音乐背景的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在符号音乐领域的表现，尤其是它们如何从文本描述中生成和理解音乐概念。

Method: 通过文本提示生成符号音乐数据，创建LLM生成的MIDI数据集，并用其训练神经网络进行音乐分类和旋律补全任务。

Result: LLMs能够推断出基本的音乐结构和时间关系，但在缺乏明确音乐背景时表现有限。

Conclusion: LLMs在符号音乐生成中具有潜力，但需要进一步研究以克服其局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at modeling relationships between strings
in natural language and have shown promise in extending to other symbolic
domains like coding or mathematics. However, the extent to which they
implicitly model symbolic music remains underexplored. This paper investigates
how LLMs represent musical concepts by generating symbolic music data from
textual prompts describing combinations of genres and styles, and evaluating
their utility through recognition and generation tasks. We produce a dataset of
LLM-generated MIDI files without relying on explicit musical training. We then
train neural networks entirely on this LLM-generated MIDI dataset and perform
genre and style classification as well as melody completion, benchmarking their
performance against established models. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can
infer rudimentary musical structures and temporal relationships from text,
highlighting both their potential to implicitly encode musical patterns and
their limitations due to a lack of explicit musical context, shedding light on
their generative capabilities for symbolic music.

### [14] [Are Knowledge and Reference in Multilingual Language Models Cross-Lingually Consistent?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12838)
*Xi Ai,Mahardika Krisna Ihsani,Min-Yen Kan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究跨语言一致性对多语言模型事实知识的影响，发现语言家族、语言因素和特定层瓶颈影响一致性，并提出代码切换训练和跨语言词对齐是最有效的改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估跨语言一致性对模型知识事实性和性能一致性的重要性，以提升多语言模型的表现。

Method: 通过分析代码混合共指陈述，使用可解释性方法研究模型行为，并评估常见多语言性能提升策略。

Result: 多语言模型在不同语言间一致性表现不一，代码切换训练和跨语言词对齐对提升一致性最有效。

Conclusion: 跨语言对齐监督和代码切换训练对提升多语言模型的一致性和性能至关重要。

Abstract: Cross-lingual consistency should be considered to assess cross-lingual
transferability, maintain the factuality of the model knowledge across
languages, and preserve the parity of language model performance. We are thus
interested in analyzing, evaluating, and interpreting cross-lingual consistency
for factual knowledge. We examine code-mixed coreferential statements conveyed
identical knowledge across languages to study cross-lingual knowledge
consistency. We use some interpretability approaches to analyze the behavior of
a model in cross-lingual contexts, discovering that multilingual models show
different levels of consistency, subject to language families, linguistic
factors, and a bottleneck in cross-lingual consistency on a particular layer.
In addition, we evaluate common strategies aimed at improving multilingual
performance to observe whether these strategies can improve knowledge
consistency at the same time. While knowledge is not cross-lingual consistency
in many cases, code-switching training and cross-lingual word alignment
objectives show the most promising results, emphasizing the noteworthiness of
cross-lingual alignment supervision and code-switching training for both
multilingual performance and cross-lingual consistency enhancement.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于预训练语言模型的分层解码器架构，通过将最后一层的语言头复制到中间层并进行微调，验证了中间层可以生成有意义的内容，并在多项任务中取得最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类分层思维能力的启发，探索构建分层解码器架构的可能性。

Method: 将预训练语言模型的最后一层语言头复制到选定的中间层，并通过不同任务输入进行微调。

Result: 实验证明中间层可以生成合理内容，分层解码器在多项任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 研究表明分层解码器架构具有潜力，未来可探索从头预训练的分层推理器。

Abstract: Decoder-only language models, such as GPT and LLaMA, generally decode on the
last layer. Motivated by human's hierarchical thinking capability, we propose
that a hierarchical decoder architecture could be built with different layers
decoding texts simultaneously. Due to limited time and computationally
resources, we choose to adapt a pretrained language model into this form of
hierarchical decoder. Language heads of the last layer are copied to different
selected intermediate layers, and fine-tuned with different task inputs. By
thorough experiments, we validate that these selective intermediate layers
could be adapted to speak meaningful and reasonable contents, and this paradigm
of hierarchical decoder can obtain state-of-the-art performances on multiple
tasks such as hierarchical text classification, classification-guided
generation, and hierarchical text generation. This study suggests the
possibility of a generalized hierarchical reasoner, pretraining from scratch.

code generation with LLMs that is used to filter and process the table. This
solution evolves from the MRT implementation for the Semeval 2025 related task.
The process consists of multiple steps: analyzing and understanding the content
of the table, selecting the useful columns, generating instructions in natural
language, translating these instructions to code, running it, and handling
potential errors or exceptions. These steps use open-source LLMs and
fine-grained optimized prompts for each step. With this approach, we achieved
an accuracy score of 85\% in the task.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的形式化模型，用于描述攻击场景和上下文，并展示了其在攻击分析和自动化脚本生成中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组织面临不断变化的威胁环境，需要自动化网络安全流程，但自动化需要输入数据的规范化。本文旨在满足这一需求。

Method: 采用UML类模型抽象化攻击场景和上下文的形式化模型。

Result: 模型成功应用于上游攻击分析和自动化攻击脚本生成。

Conclusion: 该模型为网络安全流程提供了有效的输入数据规范化方法，支持攻击分析和培训脚本生成。

Abstract: Organizations face an ever-changing threat landscape. They must continuously
dedicate significant efforts to protect their assets, making their adoption of
increased cybersecurity automation inevitable. However, process automation
requires formalization of input data. Through this paper, we address this need
for processes that use attack scenarios as input. Among these processes, one
can mention both the generation of scripts for attack simulation and training
purposes, as well as the analysis of attacks. Therefore, the paper's main
research contribution is a novel formal model that encompasses the attack's
context description and its scenario. It is abstracted using UML class model.
Once the description of our model done, we will show how it could serve an
upstream attack analysis process. We will show also its use for an automatic
generation of attack scripts in the context of cybersecurity training. These
two uses cases constitute the second contribution of this present research
work.

TL;DR: SemCSE是一种无监督学习方法，用于生成科学文本的语义嵌入，通过对比学习和LLM生成的摘要训练模型，优于传统基于引用的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于引用的方法无法准确反映语义相似性，因此需要一种能捕捉文本真实语义内容的方法。

Method: 利用对比学习和LLM生成的摘要训练模型，使语义相关的摘要嵌入更接近。

Result: 在SciRepEval基准测试中达到同类模型的最优性能，验证了语义聚焦训练的有效性。

Conclusion: SemCSE通过语义聚焦训练，显著提升了科学文本嵌入的语义表达能力。

Abstract: We introduce SemCSE, an unsupervised method for learning semantic embeddings
of scientific texts. Building on recent advances in contrastive learning for
text embeddings, our approach leverages LLM-generated summaries of scientific
abstracts to train a model that positions semantically related summaries closer
together in the embedding space. This resulting objective ensures that the
model captures the true semantic content of a text, in contrast to traditional
citation-based approaches that do not necessarily reflect semantic similarity.
To validate this, we propose a novel benchmark designed to assess a model's
ability to understand and encode the semantic content of scientific texts,
demonstrating that our method enforces a stronger semantic separation within
the embedding space. Additionally, we evaluate SemCSE on the comprehensive
SciRepEval benchmark for scientific text embeddings, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance among models of its size, thus highlighting the
benefits of a semantically focused training approach.

TL;DR: 该博士提案计划开发一个计算框架，用于识别文本中的自我方面，填补自然语言处理（NLP）领域的空白，并应用于心理健康和现象学研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自我是一个多面性概念，在语言中有所体现，但在NLP领域尚未充分探索。其与心理健康等现象的关联性凸显了系统化NLP分析的必要性。

Method: 计划构建自我方面的本体论和标注数据集，开发并评估判别模型、生成大语言模型和基于嵌入的检索方法，重点关注可解释性、真实性、准确性和计算效率。

Result: 将根据四项标准评估模型性能，并在心理健康和现象学案例研究中应用表现最佳的模型。

Conclusion: 该研究旨在填补NLP中自我分析的空白，并为心理健康和现象学领域提供实用工具。

Abstract: This Ph.D. proposal introduces a plan to develop a computational framework to
identify Self-aspects in text. The Self is a multifaceted construct and it is
reflected in language. While it is described across disciplines like cognitive
science and phenomenology, it remains underexplored in natural language
processing (NLP). Many of the aspects of the Self align with psychological and
other well-researched phenomena (e.g., those related to mental health),
highlighting the need for systematic NLP-based analysis. In line with this, we
plan to introduce an ontology of Self-aspects and a gold-standard annotated
dataset. Using this foundation, we will develop and evaluate conventional
discriminative models, generative large language models, and embedding-based
retrieval approaches against four main criteria: interpretability, ground-truth
adherence, accuracy, and computational efficiency. Top-performing models will
be applied in case studies in mental health and empirical phenomenology.

*Hadi Mohammadi,Tina Shahedi,Pablo Mosteiro,Massimo Poesio,Ayoub Bagheri,Anastasia Giachanou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了标注者人口统计特征对标签决策的影响，发现其仅占8%的方差，而推文内容是主导因素。评估生成式AI作为标注者的可靠性，发现简单的人口统计提示通常无效甚至有害。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解标注变异性来源对开发公平的NLP系统至关重要，尤其是在性别歧视检测等任务中。

Method: 使用广义线性混合模型量化人口统计特征的影响，并评估生成式AI模型作为标注者的表现。

Result: 人口统计因素仅占8%的方差，推文内容是主要因素；生成式AI的简单人口统计提示通常无效。

Conclusion: 应关注内容驱动的解释和稳健的标注协议，而非人口统计模拟，以实现公平性。

Abstract: Understanding the sources of variability in annotations is crucial for
developing fair NLP systems, especially for tasks like sexism detection where
demographic bias is a concern. This study investigates the extent to which
annotator demographic features influence labeling decisions compared to text
content. Using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model, we quantify this inf luence,
finding that while statistically present, demographic factors account for a
minor fraction ( 8%) of the observed variance, with tweet content being the
dominant factor. We then assess the reliability of Generative AI (GenAI) models
as annotators, specifically evaluating if guiding them with demographic
personas improves alignment with human judgments. Our results indicate that
simplistic persona prompting often fails to enhance, and sometimes degrades,
performance compared to baseline models. Furthermore, explainable AI (XAI)
techniques reveal that model predictions rely heavily on content-specific
tokens related to sexism, rather than correlates of demographic
characteristics. We argue that focusing on content-driven explanations and
robust annotation protocols offers a more reliable path towards fairness than
potentially persona simulation.

Motivation: 探讨口语叙事能力对后期读写能力发展的预测作用，并识别需要干预的儿童的语言特征。

Method: 使用简单机器学习方法分析四至五岁儿童的录音故事，比较阿非利卡语和科萨语的数据。

Result: 词汇多样性和句子长度是典型发展的指标；特定动词和助动词的使用与干预需求减少相关。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了语言特异性和共享的叙事能力预测因子，对多语言环境下的早期评估有启示。

Abstract: Oral narrative skills are strong predictors of later literacy development.
This study examines the features of oral narratives from children who were
identified by experts as requiring intervention. Using simple machine learning
methods, we analyse recorded stories from four- and five-year-old Afrikaans-
and isiXhosa-speaking children. Consistent with prior research, we identify
lexical diversity (unique words) and length-based features (mean utterance
length) as indicators of typical development, but features like articulation
rate prove less informative. Despite cross-linguistic variation in
part-of-speech patterns, the use of specific verbs and auxiliaries associated
with goal-directed storytelling is correlated with a reduced likelihood of
requiring intervention. Our analysis of two linguistically distinct languages
reveals both language-specific and shared predictors of narrative proficiency,
with implications for early assessment in multilingual contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GEMMAS是一个基于图的评估框架，通过建模多智能体交互为有向无环图，提出信息多样性分数（IDS）和不必要路径比率（UPR）两个过程级指标，揭示协作效率差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估仅关注最终输出的正确性，忽略了低效通信和协调导致的冗余推理和计算成本。

Method: 引入GEMMAS框架，建模智能体交互为有向无环图，提出IDS和UPR两个过程级指标。

Result: 在GSM8K基准测试中，准确率仅差2.1%的系统在IDS和UPR上差异显著（12.8%和80%）。

Conclusion: 仅依赖结果指标不足以评估多智能体性能，过程级诊断对设计高效协作AI系统至关重要。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on language models have shown strong performance on
collaborative reasoning tasks. However, existing evaluations focus only on the
correctness of the final output, overlooking how inefficient communication and
poor coordination contribute to redundant reasoning and higher computational
costs. We introduce GEMMAS, a graph-based evaluation framework that analyzes
the internal collaboration process by modeling agent interactions as a directed
acyclic graph. To capture collaboration quality, we propose two process-level
metrics: Information Diversity Score (IDS) to measure semantic variation in
inter-agent messages, and Unnecessary Path Ratio (UPR) to quantify redundant
reasoning paths. We evaluate GEMMAS across five benchmarks and highlight
results on GSM8K, where systems with only a 2.1% difference in accuracy differ
by 12.8% in IDS and 80% in UPR, revealing substantial variation in internal
collaboration. These findings demonstrate that outcome-only metrics are
insufficient for evaluating multi-agent performance and highlight the
importance of process-level diagnostics in designing more interpretable and
resource-efficient collaborative AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期儿童叙述和理解能力的培养对后期读写能力至关重要，但教师在大型学前班中难以准确识别需要干预的学生。

Method: 系统结合自动语音识别和机器学习评分模型，预测叙述和理解分数，比较了线性模型和LLM的表现。

Result: LLM在大多数情况下优于线性模型，但线性模型表现仍具竞争力；LLM系统在标记需要干预的儿童方面与人类专家相当。

Conclusion: 该系统为课堂自动口头评估奠定了基础，帮助教师专注于个性化学习支持。

Abstract: Developing narrative and comprehension skills in early childhood is critical
for later literacy. However, teachers in large preschool classrooms struggle to
accurately identify students who require intervention. We present a system for
automatically assessing oral narratives of preschool children in Afrikaans and
isiXhosa. The system uses automatic speech recognition followed by a machine
learning scoring model to predict narrative and comprehension scores. For
scoring predicted transcripts, we compare a linear model to a large language
model (LLM). The LLM-based system outperforms the linear model in most cases,
but the linear system is competitive despite its simplicity. The LLM-based
system is comparable to a human expert in flagging children who require
intervention. We lay the foundation for automatic oral assessments in
classrooms, giving teachers extra capacity to focus on personalised support for
children's learning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CAST的新框架，通过操纵LLMs的内部激活状态实现跨任务知识迁移，无需参数更新或输入扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在数据稀缺场景下对未见任务的适应性较差，现有跨任务上下文学习方法在鲁棒性、可扩展性和效率方面存在挑战。

Method: 通过分析LLMs潜在空间中的激活模式，提出CAST框架，利用高资源任务的样本增强激活状态，适配低资源任务。

Result: 实验表明，CAST在跨域和跨语言迁移任务中优于基线方法，具有更高的可扩展性和更低的计算成本。

Conclusion: CAST通过潜在空间激活操纵实现了高效的跨任务知识迁移，为LLMs在数据稀缺场景下的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive abilities in leveraging
pretrained knowledge through prompting, but they often struggle with unseen
tasks, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. While cross-task in-context
learning offers a direct solution for transferring knowledge across tasks, it
still faces critical challenges in terms of robustness, scalability, and
efficiency. In this paper, we investigate whether cross-task transfer can be
achieved via latent space steering without parameter updates or input
expansion. Through an analysis of activation patterns in the latent space of
LLMs, we observe that the enhanced activations induced by in-context examples
have consistent patterns across different tasks. Inspired by these findings, we
propose CAST, a novel Cross-task Activation Steering Transfer framework that
enables effective transfer by manipulating the model's internal activation
states. Our approach first selects influential and diverse samples from
high-resource tasks, then utilizes their contrastive representation-enhanced
activations to adapt LLMs to low-resource tasks. Extensive experiments across
both cross-domain and cross-lingual transfer settings show that our method
outperforms competitive baselines and demonstrates superior scalability and
lower computational costs.

Method: 方法包括构建HATS测试集（405道选择题），并引入基于认知理论的Chain of Thought提示策略。

Result: 实验表明，模型在英语提示下表现最佳，新方法显著提升了印地语类比问题的解决能力。

Conclusion: 结论是HATS填补了印地语推理评估资源的空缺，为未来研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Analogies test a model's ability to infer implicit relationships between
concepts, making them a key benchmark for evaluating reasoning capabilities.
While large language models (LLMs) are widely evaluated for reasoning in
English, their abilities in Indic languages remain understudied, limiting our
understanding of whether these models generalize across languages. To address
this gap, we introduce a new Hindi Analogy Test Set (HATS), comprising 405
multiple-choice questions sourced from Indian government exams. We benchmark
state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs using various prompting strategies and
introduce a grounded Chain of Thought approach that leverages cognitive
theories of analogical reasoning. This approach improves model performance on
Hindi analogy questions. Our experiments show that models perform best with
English prompts, irrespective of the prompting strategy. Our test set addresses
the lack of a critical resource to evaluate LLM reasoning capabilities in
Hindi.

TL;DR: AutoSteer是一种模块化、自适应的推理时间干预技术，无需微调基础模型即可提升多模态大语言模型的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在跨模态推理方面取得了进展，但也带来了新的安全隐患，尤其是在面对对抗性多模态输入时。

Method: AutoSteer包含三个核心组件：安全感知评分（SAS）、自适应安全探测器和一个轻量级的拒绝头，用于选择性干预生成过程。

Result: 在多个安全关键基准测试中，AutoSteer显著降低了文本、视觉和跨模态威胁的攻击成功率（ASR），同时保持了模型的通用能力。

Conclusion: AutoSteer是一种实用、可解释且有效的框架，可用于更安全地部署多模态AI系统。

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has unlocked
powerful cross-modal reasoning abilities, but also raised new safety concerns,
particularly when faced with adversarial multimodal inputs. To improve the
safety of MLLMs during inference, we introduce a modular and adaptive
inference-time intervention technology, AutoSteer, without requiring any
fine-tuning of the underlying model. AutoSteer incorporates three core
components: (1) a novel Safety Awareness Score (SAS) that automatically
identifies the most safety-relevant distinctions among the model's internal
layers; (2) an adaptive safety prober trained to estimate the likelihood of
toxic outputs from intermediate representations; and (3) a lightweight Refusal
Head that selectively intervenes to modulate generation when safety risks are
detected. Experiments on LLaVA-OV and Chameleon across diverse safety-critical
benchmarks demonstrate that AutoSteer significantly reduces the Attack Success
Rate (ASR) for textual, visual, and cross-modal threats, while maintaining
general abilities. These findings position AutoSteer as a practical,
interpretable, and effective framework for safer deployment of multimodal AI
systems.

Motivation: 尽管强化学习在训练大型语言推理模型中扮演重要角色，但其在多步推理（尤其是复杂问题）上的有效性受到质疑。

Method: 采用问题增强策略，即在训练过程中引入部分解决方案，降低问题难度并提供更有信息量的学习信号。

Result: 在数学推理任务中，QuestA显著提升了pass@1和pass@k的表现，特别是在标准强化学习难以取得进展的问题上。实验结果显示，在多个数学基准测试中取得了新的最佳成绩。

Conclusion: QuestA不仅提升了推理能力，还提供了理论解释，证明其提高了样本效率，为通过强化学习扩展推理能力提供了一条实用且可推广的路径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key component in training large
language reasoning models (LLMs). However, recent studies questions its
effectiveness in improving multi-step reasoning-particularly on hard problems.
To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective strategy via
Question Augmentation: introduce partial solutions during training to reduce
problem difficulty and provide more informative learning signals. Our method,
QuestA, when applied during RL training on math reasoning tasks, not only
improves pass@1 but also pass@k-particularly on problems where standard RL
struggles to make progress. This enables continual improvement over strong
open-source models such as DeepScaleR and OpenMath Nemotron, further enhancing
their reasoning capabilities. We achieve new state-of-the-art results on math
benchmarks using 1.5B-parameter models: 67.1% (+5.3%) on AIME24, 59.5% (+10.0%)
on AIME25, and 35.5% (+4.0%) on HMMT25. Further, we provide theoretical
explanations that QuestA improves sample efficiency, offering a practical and
generalizable pathway for expanding reasoning capability through RL.

Motivation: 当前人力资源管理领域缺乏公开数据和基准测试，阻碍了语言技术的可靠性和公平性发展。

Method: 通过构建真实职位申请数据集，设计多语言任务（职位匹配和技能预测），并评估模型在单语和跨语言场景下的表现及性别偏见。

Result: 吸引了76个团队参与，提交280多份方案，结果显示训练策略比模型规模影响更大。

Conclusion: TalentCLEF为劳动力市场语言技术提供了首个公开基准，促进了稳健、公平和可迁移技术的发展。

Abstract: Advances in natural language processing and large language models are driving
a major transformation in Human Capital Management, with a growing interest in
building smart systems based on language technologies for talent acquisition,
upskilling strategies, and workforce planning. However, the adoption and
progress of these technologies critically depend on the development of reliable
and fair models, properly evaluated on public data and open benchmarks, which
have so far been unavailable in this domain.
  To address this gap, we present TalentCLEF 2025, the first evaluation
campaign focused on skill and job title intelligence. The lab consists of two
tasks: Task A - Multilingual Job Title Matching, covering English, Spanish,
German, and Chinese; and Task B - Job Title-Based Skill Prediction, in English.
Both corpora were built from real job applications, carefully anonymized, and
manually annotated to reflect the complexity and diversity of real-world labor
market data, including linguistic variability and gender-marked expressions.
  The evaluations included monolingual and cross-lingual scenarios and covered
the evaluation of gender bias.
  TalentCLEF attracted 76 registered teams with more than 280 submissions. Most
systems relied on information retrieval techniques built with multilingual
encoder-based models fine-tuned with contrastive learning, and several of them
incorporated large language models for data augmentation or re-ranking. The
results show that the training strategies have a larger effect than the size of
the model alone. TalentCLEF provides the first public benchmark in this field
and encourages the development of robust, fair, and transferable language
technologies for the labor market.

Conclusion: RCPS和PREVAL为高质量媒体演示的生成和评估提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Automated generation of high-quality media presentations is challenging,
requiring robust content extraction, narrative planning, visual design, and
overall quality optimization. Existing methods often produce presentations with
logical inconsistencies and suboptimal layouts, thereby struggling to meet
professional standards. To address these challenges, we introduce RCPS
(Reflective Coherent Presentation Synthesis), a novel framework integrating
three key components: (1) Deep Structured Narrative Planning; (2) Adaptive
Layout Generation; (3) an Iterative Optimization Loop. Additionally, we propose
PREVAL, a preference-based evaluation framework employing rationale-enhanced
multi-dimensional models to assess presentation quality across Content,
Coherence, and Design. Experimental results demonstrate that RCPS significantly
outperforms baseline methods across all quality dimensions, producing
presentations that closely approximate human expert standards. PREVAL shows
strong correlation with human judgments, validating it as a reliable automated
tool for assessing presentation quality.

Method: 基于1500个专家标注的NLP论文示例构建AbGen基准，评估LLMs生成消融研究设计的能力，并开发AbGen-Eval评估自动化评估系统的可靠性。

Result: LLMs在消融研究设计上与人类专家存在显著差距，且自动化评估方法不可靠。

Conclusion: AbGen和AbGen-Eval为未来开发更可靠的LLM评估系统提供了基础。

Abstract: We introduce AbGen, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities
of LLMs in designing ablation studies for scientific research. AbGen consists
of 1,500 expert-annotated examples derived from 807 NLP papers. In this
benchmark, LLMs are tasked with generating detailed ablation study designs for
a specified module or process based on the given research context. Our
evaluation of leading LLMs, such as DeepSeek-R1-0528 and o4-mini, highlights a
significant performance gap between these models and human experts in terms of
the importance, faithfulness, and soundness of the ablation study designs.
Moreover, we demonstrate that current automated evaluation methods are not
reliable for our task, as they show a significant discrepancy when compared to
human assessment. To better investigate this, we develop AbGen-Eval, a
meta-evaluation benchmark designed to assess the reliability of commonly used
automated evaluation systems in measuring LLM performance on our task. We
investigate various LLM-as-Judge systems on AbGen-Eval, providing insights for
future research on developing more effective and reliable LLM-based evaluation
systems for complex scientific tasks.

Result: T5和AST模型组合在检索任务中表现最佳，尤其在分类训练时效果显著。

Conclusion: HapticCap数据集和提出的框架为触觉信号与文本描述匹配提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Haptic signals, from smartphone vibrations to virtual reality touch feedback,
can effectively convey information and enhance realism, but designing signals
that resonate meaningfully with users is challenging. To facilitate this, we
introduce a multimodal dataset and task, of matching user descriptions to
vibration haptic signals, and highlight two primary challenges: (1) lack of
large haptic vibration datasets annotated with textual descriptions as
collecting haptic descriptions is time-consuming, and (2) limited capability of
existing tasks and models to describe vibration signals in text. To advance
this area, we create HapticCap, the first fully human-annotated
haptic-captioned dataset, containing 92,070 haptic-text pairs for user
descriptions of sensory, emotional, and associative attributes of vibrations.
Based on HapticCap, we propose the haptic-caption retrieval task and present
the results of this task from a supervised contrastive learning framework that
brings together text representations within specific categories and vibrations.
Overall, the combination of language model T5 and audio model AST yields the
best performance in the haptic-caption retrieval task, especially when
separately trained for each description category.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索搜索引擎和用户意识形态查询如何共同导致搜索结果偏见，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 分析主要搜索引擎在政治和社会话题上的输出数据。

Result: 搜索引擎优先排序内容反映偏见，用户意识形态查询进一步加剧偏见，不同搜索引擎在来源优先排序上存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 搜索引擎通过强化意识形态分歧影响公众认知，加剧信息极化问题。

Abstract: Search engines play a crucial role in shaping public discourse by influencing
how information is accessed and framed. While prior research has extensively
examined various dimensions of search bias -- such as content prioritization,
indexical bias, political polarization, and sources of bias -- an important
question remains underexplored: how do search engines and
ideologically-motivated user queries contribute to bias in search results. This
study analyzes the outputs of major search engines using a dataset of political
and social topics. The findings reveal that search engines not only prioritize
content in ways that reflect underlying biases but also that
ideologically-driven user queries exacerbate these biases, resulting in the
amplification of specific narratives. Moreover, significant differences were
observed across search engines in terms of the sources they prioritize. These
results suggest that search engines may play a pivotal role in shaping public
perceptions by reinforcing ideological divides, thereby contributing to the
broader issue of information polarization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨视觉-语言（VL）训练是否显著改变语言模型的词汇概念知识，特别是其分类组织。

Method: 通过比较纯文本语言模型和VL训练模型在文本问答任务中的表现，分析其分类知识及表示方式。

Result: VL模型在需要分类理解的问答任务中表现更好，但分类知识本身无显著变化，差异在于任务中的知识运用方式。

Conclusion: VL训练未显著改变分类知识，但提升了其在纯语言任务中的运用能力。

Abstract: Does vision-and-language (VL) training change the linguistic representations
of language models in meaningful ways? Most results in the literature have
shown inconsistent or marginal differences, both behaviorally and
representationally. In this work, we start from the hypothesis that the domain
in which VL training could have a significant effect is lexical-conceptual
knowledge, in particular its taxonomic organization. Through comparing minimal
pairs of text-only LMs and their VL-trained counterparts, we first show that
the VL models often outperform their text-only counterparts on a text-only
question-answering task that requires taxonomic understanding of concepts
mentioned in the questions. Using an array of targeted behavioral and
representational analyses, we show that the LMs and VLMs do not differ
significantly in terms of their taxonomic knowledge itself, but they differ in
how they represent questions that contain concepts in a taxonomic relation vs.
a non-taxonomic relation. This implies that the taxonomic knowledge itself does
not change substantially through additional VL training, but VL training does
improve the deployment of this knowledge in the context of a specific task,
even when the presentation of the task is purely linguistic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer模型在长度泛化问题上的局限性，探索更通用的解决方案。

Method: 提出TAIL方法，通过计算机程序合成模仿图灵机执行过程的链式思维数据，扩展推理步骤为原子状态。

Result: TAIL显著提升了Qwen2.5-7B模型在多种任务上的长度泛化能力和性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 图灵机的关键概念对长度泛化至关重要，为未来基于合成数据的LLM推理学习提供了方向。

Abstract: Length generalization, the ability to solve problems of longer sequences than
those observed during training, poses a core challenge of Transformer-based
large language models (LLM). Although existing studies have predominantly
focused on data-driven approaches for arithmetic operations and symbolic
manipulation tasks, these approaches tend to be task-specific with limited
overall performance. To pursue a more general solution, this paper focuses on a
broader case of reasoning problems that are computable, i.e., problems that
algorithms can solve, thus can be solved by the Turing Machine. From this
perspective, this paper proposes Turing MAchine Imitation Learning (TAIL) to
improve the length generalization ability of LLMs. TAIL synthesizes
chain-of-thoughts (CoT) data that imitate the execution process of a Turing
Machine by computer programs, which linearly expands the reasoning steps into
atomic states to alleviate shortcut learning and explicit memory fetch
mechanism to reduce the difficulties of dynamic and long-range data access in
elementary operations. To validate the reliability and universality of TAIL, we
construct a challenging synthetic dataset covering 8 classes of algorithms and
18 tasks. Without bells and whistles, TAIL significantly improves the length
generalization ability as well as the performance of Qwen2.5-7B on various
tasks using only synthetic data, surpassing previous methods and DeepSeek-R1.
The experimental results reveal that the key concepts in the Turing Machine,
instead of the thinking styles, are indispensable for TAIL for length
generalization, through which the model exhibits read-and-write behaviors
consistent with the properties of the Turing Machine in their attention layers.
This work provides a promising direction for future research in the learning of
LLM reasoning from synthetic data.

Motivation: 研究LLM性能受上下文信息影响的问题，提出系统化优化方法以提升模型表现。

Method: 通过分析1300多篇研究论文，将上下文工程分解为基础组件（检索、生成、处理和管理）和系统实现（如RAG、记忆系统等）。

Result: 发现模型在理解复杂上下文方面表现出色，但在生成复杂长文本方面存在明显局限。

Conclusion: 未来研究需解决模型能力不对称问题，为上下文感知AI提供统一框架。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is fundamentally determined
by the contextual information provided during inference. This survey introduces
Context Engineering, a formal discipline that transcends simple prompt design
to encompass the systematic optimization of information payloads for LLMs. We
present a comprehensive taxonomy decomposing Context Engineering into its
foundational components and the sophisticated implementations that integrate
them into intelligent systems. We first examine the foundational components:
context retrieval and generation, context processing and context management. We
then explore how these components are architecturally integrated to create
sophisticated system implementations: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
memory systems and tool-integrated reasoning, and multi-agent systems. Through
this systematic analysis of over 1300 research papers, our survey not only
establishes a technical roadmap for the field but also reveals a critical
research gap: a fundamental asymmetry exists between model capabilities. While
current models, augmented by advanced context engineering, demonstrate
remarkable proficiency in understanding complex contexts, they exhibit
pronounced limitations in generating equally sophisticated, long-form outputs.
Addressing this gap is a defining priority for future research. Ultimately,
this survey provides a unified framework for both researchers and engineers
advancing context-aware AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算幽默研究集中于简单双关笑话，忽略了复杂幽默形式，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 构建包含600个笑话的数据集，涵盖4种笑话类型，并手动编写高质量解释，比较多种LLMs的零样本解释能力。

Result: 测试的LLMs（包括推理模型）均无法可靠生成所有笑话类型的充分解释。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了计算幽默领域对简单笑话形式的过度关注，并指出复杂幽默解释的研究缺口。

Abstract: Humour, as a complex language form, is derived from myriad aspects of life,
whilst existing work on computational humour has focussed almost exclusively on
short pun-based jokes. In this work, we investigate whether the ability of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to explain humour depends on the particular humour
form. We compare models on simple puns and more complex topical humour that
requires knowledge of real-world entities and events. In doing so, we curate a
dataset of 600 jokes split across 4 joke types and manually write high-quality
explanations. These jokes include heterographic and homographic puns,
contemporary internet humour, and topical jokes, where understanding relies on
reasoning beyond "common sense", rooted instead in world knowledge regarding
news events and pop culture. Using this dataset, we compare the zero-shot
abilities of a range of LLMs to accurately and comprehensively explain jokes of
different types, identifying key research gaps in the task of humour
explanation. We find that none of the tested models (inc. reasoning models) are
capable of reliably generating adequate explanations of all joke types, further
highlighting the narrow focus of most works in computational humour on overly
simple joke forms.

TL;DR: EaGERS是一个无需训练的模型无关流水线，通过视觉语言模型生成自然语言推理，将推理定位到空间子区域，并仅从相关区域生成响应，在DocVQA数据集上提升了精确匹配准确率和平均归一化编辑距离相似度指标。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的文档视觉问答(DocVQA)系统缺乏透明度和可重现性，需要一种能够提供可解释推理过程且无需额外微调的方法来提升模型性能和可信度。

Method: 提出EaGERS流水线，包含三个步骤：(1)通过视觉语言模型生成自然语言推理；(2)通过计算可配置网格上的多模态嵌入相似度并使用多数投票将推理定位到空间子区域；(3)仅从掩码图像中选定的相关区域生成响应。

Result: 在DocVQA数据集上的实验表明，最佳配置在精确匹配准确率和平均归一化Levenshtein相似度指标上都优于基础模型，同时增强了DocVQA的透明度和可重现性。

Conclusion: EaGERS作为一个完全无需训练和模型无关的流水线，成功提升了文档视觉问答的性能，同时提供了更好的可解释性和透明度，且无需额外的模型微调。

Abstract: We introduce EaGERS, a fully training-free and model-agnostic pipeline that
(1) generates natural language rationales via a vision language model, (2)
grounds these rationales to spatial sub-regions by computing multimodal
embedding similarities over a configurable grid with majority voting, and (3)
restricts the generation of responses only from the relevant regions selected
in the masked image. Experiments on the DocVQA dataset demonstrate that our
best configuration not only outperforms the base model on exact match accuracy
and Average Normalized Levenshtein Similarity metrics but also enhances
transparency and reproducibility in DocVQA without additional model
fine-tuning.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在3D空间推理任务中表现不佳，缺乏对3D动态的内部建模能力。

Result: 在SAT基准测试中平均性能提升超过8%，优于基于强化学习的推理模型。

Conclusion: MindJourney展示了利用世界模型进行测试时扩展的潜力，为3D推理提供了一种简单、即插即用的解决方案。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in 3D space is central to human cognition and indispensable
for embodied tasks such as navigation and manipulation. However,
state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) struggle frequently with tasks
as simple as anticipating how a scene will look after an egocentric motion:
they perceive 2D images but lack an internal model of 3D dynamics. We therefore
propose MindJourney, a test-time scaling framework that grants a VLM with this
missing capability by coupling it to a controllable world model based on video
diffusion. The VLM iteratively sketches a concise camera trajectory, while the
world model synthesizes the corresponding view at each step. The VLM then
reasons over this multi-view evidence gathered during the interactive
exploration. Without any fine-tuning, our MindJourney achieves over an average
8% performance boost on the representative spatial reasoning benchmark SAT,
showing that pairing VLMs with world models for test-time scaling offers a
simple, plug-and-play route to robust 3D reasoning. Meanwhile, our method also
improves upon the test-time inference VLMs trained through reinforcement
learning, which demonstrates the potential of our method that utilizes world
models for test-time scaling.

Motivation: 现有单模态MLLM在视觉编码和语言解码集成中存在优化不稳定和灾难性遗忘的问题，需要一种更稳定的学习方法和高效的预训练策略。

Abstract: This paper focuses on monolithic Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
which integrate visual encoding and language decoding into a single model.
Existing structures and pre-training strategies for monolithic MLLMs often
suffer from unstable optimization and catastrophic forgetting. To address these
challenges, our key idea is to embed a new visual parameter space into a
pre-trained LLM, enabling stable learning of visual knowledge from noisy data
via delta tuning. Based on this principle, we first introduce Mono-InternVL, an
advanced monolithic MLLM that incorporates a set of visual experts through a
multimodal mixture-of-experts architecture. In addition, we design an
innovative Endogenous Visual Pre-training (EViP) for Mono-InternVL to maximize
its visual capabilities via progressive learning. Mono-InternVL achieves
competitive performance against existing MLLMs but also leads to relatively
expensive data cost. Therefore, we further present Mono-InternVL-1.5, a cheaper
and stronger monolithic MLLM equipped with an improved EViP (EViP++). EViP++
introduces additional visual attention experts to Mono-InternVL-1.5 and
re-organizes the pre-training process in an efficient manner. During inference,
it includes a fused CUDA kernel to speed up its MoE operations. With these
designs, Mono-InternVL-1.5 significantly reduces training and inference costs,
while still maintaining competitive performance with Mono-InternVL. To evaluate
our approach, we conduct extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks. Results
demonstrate that Mono-InternVL outperforms existing monolithic MLLMs on 12 out
of 15 benchmarks, e.g., +114-point improvement over Emu3 on OCRBench. Compared
to its modular counterpart, i.e., InternVL-1.5, Mono-InternVL-1.5 achieves
similar multimodal performance while reducing first-token latency by up to 69%.

Abstract: Crop mapping involves identifying and classifying crop types using spatial
data, primarily derived from remote sensing imagery. This study presents the
first comprehensive review of large-scale, pixel-wise crop mapping workflows,
encompassing both conventional supervised methods and emerging transfer
learning approaches. To identify the optimal supervised crop mapping workflows,
we conducted systematic experiments, comparing six widely adopted satellite
image-based preprocessing methods, alongside eleven supervised pixel-wise
classification models. Additionally, we assessed the synergistic impact of
varied training sample sizes and variable combinations. Moreover, we identified
optimal transfer learning techniques for different magnitudes of domain shift.
The evaluation of best methods was conducted across five diverse agricultural
sites. Landsat 8 served as the primary satellite data source. Labels come from
CDL trusted pixels and field surveys.
  Our findings reveal three key insights. First, fine-scale interval
preprocessing paired with Transformer models consistently delivered optimal
performance for both supervised and transferable workflows. RF offered rapid
training and competitive performance in conventional supervised learning and
direct transfer to similar domains. Second, transfer learning techniques
enhanced workflow adaptability, with UDA being effective for homogeneous crop
classes while fine-tuning remains robust across diverse scenarios. Finally,
workflow choice depends heavily on the availability of labeled samples. With a
sufficient sample size, supervised training typically delivers more accurate
and generalizable results. Below a certain threshold, transfer learning that
matches the level of domain shift is a viable alternative to achieve crop
mapping. Repository:

Abstract: Understanding radiologists' eye movement during Computed Tomography (CT)
reading is crucial for developing effective interpretable computer-aided
diagnosis systems. However, CT research in this area has been limited by the
lack of publicly available eye-tracking datasets and the three-dimensional
complexity of CT volumes. To address these challenges, we present the first
publicly available eye gaze dataset on CT, called CT-ScanGaze. Then, we
introduce CT-Searcher, a novel 3D scanpath predictor designed specifically to
process CT volumes and generate radiologist-like 3D fixation sequences,
overcoming the limitations of current scanpath predictors that only handle 2D
inputs. Since deep learning models benefit from a pretraining step, we develop
a pipeline that converts existing 2D gaze datasets into 3D gaze data to
pretrain CT-Searcher. Through both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on
CT-ScanGaze, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and provide a
comprehensive assessment framework for 3D scanpath prediction in medical
imaging.

Abstract: Tree species classification from terrestrial LiDAR point clouds is
challenging because of the complex multi-scale geometric structures in forest
environments. Existing approaches using multi-scale dynamic graph convolutional
neural networks (MS-DGCNN) employ parallel multi-scale processing, which fails
to capture the semantic relationships between the hierarchical levels of the
tree architecture. We present MS-DGCNN++, a hierarchical multiscale fusion
dynamic graph convolutional network that uses semantically meaningful feature
extraction at local, branch, and canopy scales with cross-scale information
propagation. Our method employs scale-specific feature engineering, including
standard geometric features for the local scale, normalized relative vectors
for the branch scale, and distance information for the canopy scale. This
hierarchical approach replaces uniform parallel processing with semantically
differentiated representations that are aligned with the natural tree
structure. Under the same proposed tree species data augmentation strategy for
all experiments, MS-DGCNN++ achieved an accuracy of 94.96 \% on STPCTLS,
outperforming DGCNN, MS-DGCNN, and the state-of-the-art model PPT. On
FOR-species20K, it achieves 67.25\% accuracy (6.1\% improvement compared to
MS-DGCNN). For standard 3D object recognition, our method outperformed DGCNN
and MS-DGCNN with overall accuracies of 93.15\% on ModelNet40 and 94.05\% on
ModelNet10. With lower parameters and reduced complexity compared to
state-of-the-art transformer approaches, our method is suitable for
resource-constrained applications while maintaining a competitive accuracy.
Beyond tree classification, the method generalizes to standard 3D object
recognition, establishing it as a versatile solution for diverse point cloud
processing applications. The implementation code is publicly available at
https://github.com/said-ohamouddou/MS-DGCNN2.

achieving up to 63.9% accuracy in predicting shot direction (left or right),
outperforming the real goalkeepers' decisions. These results demonstrate the

Result: 在HICO-DET和V-COCO数据集上，零样本和全监督设置下性能显著提升，未见和罕见HOI类别分别提升12.4%和8.4%。

Conclusion: Funnel-HOI通过编码器阶段的HOI线索预判和新型损失函数，实现了更优的交互检测性能。

Abstract: Human-object interaction detection (HOID) refers to localizing interactive
human-object pairs in images and identifying the interactions. Since there
could be an exponential number of object-action combinations, labeled data is
limited - leading to a long-tail distribution problem. Recently, zero-shot
learning emerged as a solution, with end-to-end transformer-based object
detectors adapted for HOID becoming successful frameworks. However, their
primary focus is designing improved decoders for learning entangled or
disentangled interpretations of interactions. We advocate that HOI-specific
cues must be anticipated at the encoder stage itself to obtain a stronger scene
interpretation. Consequently, we build a top-down framework named Funnel-HOI
inspired by the human tendency to grasp well-defined concepts first and then
associate them with abstract concepts during scene understanding. We first
probe an image for the presence of objects (well-defined concepts) and then
probe for actions (abstract concepts) associated with them. A novel asymmetric
co-attention mechanism mines these cues utilizing multimodal information
(incorporating zero-shot capabilities) and yields stronger interaction
representations at the encoder level. Furthermore, a novel loss is devised that
considers objectaction relatedness and regulates misclassification penalty
better than existing loss functions for guiding the interaction classifier.
Extensive experiments on the HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets across
fully-supervised and six zero-shot settings reveal our state-of-the-art
performance, with up to 12.4% and 8.4% gains for unseen and rare HOI
categories, respectively.

Result: CogNVS在动态场景新视角合成任务中优于大多数现有方法。

Conclusion: CogNVS提供了一种高效且几何一致的新视角合成解决方案。

Abstract: We explore novel-view synthesis for dynamic scenes from monocular videos.
Prior approaches rely on costly test-time optimization of 4D representations or
do not preserve scene geometry when trained in a feed-forward manner. Our
approach is based on three key insights: (1) covisible pixels (that are visible
in both the input and target views) can be rendered by first reconstructing the
dynamic 3D scene and rendering the reconstruction from the novel-views and (2)
hidden pixels in novel views can be "inpainted" with feed-forward 2D video
diffusion models. Notably, our video inpainting diffusion model (CogNVS) can be
self-supervised from 2D videos, allowing us to train it on a large corpus of
in-the-wild videos. This in turn allows for (3) CogNVS to be applied zero-shot
to novel test videos via test-time finetuning. We empirically verify that
CogNVS outperforms almost all prior art for novel-view synthesis of dynamic
scenes from monocular videos.

Conclusion: 该研究为早期心血管疾病检测提供了非侵入性生物标志物，支持个性化预防和精准医疗。

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading global cause of mortality,
yet current risk stratification methods often fail to detect early, subclinical
changes. Previous studies have generally not integrated retinal
microvasculature characteristics with comprehensive serum lipidomic profiles as
potential indicators of CVD risk. In this study, an innovative imaging omics
framework was introduced, combining retinal microvascular traits derived
through deep learning based image processing with serum lipidomic data to
highlight asymptomatic biomarkers of cardiovascular risk beyond the
conventional lipid panel. This represents the first large scale, covariate
adjusted and stratified correlation analysis conducted in a healthy population,
which is essential for identifying early indicators of disease. Retinal
phenotypes were quantified using automated image analysis tools, while serum
lipid profiling was performed by Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography
Electrospray ionization High resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC ESI HRMS).
Strong, age- and sex-independent correlations were established, particularly
between average artery width, vessel density, and lipid subclasses such as
triacylglycerols (TAGs), diacylglycerols (DAGs), and ceramides (Cers). These
associations suggest a converging mechanism of microvascular remodeling under
metabolic stress. By linking detailed
  vascular structural phenotypes to specific lipid species, this study fills a
critical gap in the understanding of early CVD pathogenesis. This integration
not only offers a novel perspective on microvascular metabolic associations but
also presents a significant opportunity for the identification of robust,
non-invasive biomarkers. Ultimately, these findings may support improved early
detection, targeted prevention, and personalized approaches in cardiovascular
healthcare.

Abstract: Automated structural defect segmentation in civil infrastructure faces a
critical challenge: achieving high accuracy while maintaining computational
efficiency for real-time deployment. This paper presents FORTRESS
(Function-composition Optimized Real-Time Resilient Structural Segmentation), a
new architecture that balances accuracy and speed by using a special method
that combines depthwise separable convolutions with adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold
Network integration. FORTRESS incorporates three key innovations: a systematic
depthwise separable convolution framework achieving a 3.6x parameter reduction
per layer, adaptive TiKAN integration that selectively applies function
composition transformations only when computationally beneficial, and
multi-scale attention fusion combining spatial, channel, and KAN-enhanced
features across decoder levels. The architecture achieves remarkable efficiency
gains with 91% parameter reduction (31M to 2.9M), 91% computational complexity
reduction (13.7 to 1.17 GFLOPs), and 3x inference speed improvement while
delivering superior segmentation performance. Evaluation on benchmark
infrastructure datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art results with an F1- score
of 0.771 and a mean IoU of 0.677, significantly outperforming existing methods
including U-Net, SA-UNet, and U- KAN. The dual optimization strategy proves
essential for optimal performance, establishing FORTRESS as a robust solution
for practical structural defect segmentation in resource-constrained
environments where both accuracy and computational efficiency are paramount.

Abstract: We develop a neural parametric model for 3D leaves for plant modeling and
reconstruction that are essential for agriculture and computer graphics. While
neural parametric models are actively studied for humans and animals, plant
leaves present unique challenges due to their diverse shapes and flexible
deformation. To this problem, we introduce a neural parametric model for
leaves, NeuraLeaf. Capitalizing on the fact that flattened leaf shapes can be
approximated as a 2D plane, NeuraLeaf disentangles the leaves' geometry into
their 2D base shapes and 3D deformations. This representation allows learning
from rich sources of 2D leaf image datasets for the base shapes, and also has
the advantage of simultaneously learning textures aligned with the geometry. To
model the 3D deformation, we propose a novel skeleton-free skinning model and
create a newly captured 3D leaf dataset called DeformLeaf. We show that
NeuraLeaf successfully generates a wide range of leaf shapes with deformation,
resulting in accurate model fitting to 3D observations like depth maps and
point clouds. Our implementation and dataset are available at

Abstract: Hair transfer is increasingly valuable across domains such as social media,
gaming, advertising, and entertainment. While significant progress has been
made in single-image hair transfer, video-based hair transfer remains
challenging due to the need for temporal consistency, spatial fidelity, and
dynamic adaptability. In this work, we propose HairShifter, a novel "Anchor
Frame + Animation" framework that unifies high-quality image hair transfer with
smooth and coherent video animation. At its core, HairShifter integrates a
Image Hair Transfer (IHT) module for precise per-frame transformation and a
Multi-Scale Gated SPADE Decoder to ensure seamless spatial blending and
temporal coherence. Our method maintains hairstyle fidelity across frames while
preserving non-hair regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HairShifter
achieves state-of-the-art performance in video hairstyle transfer, combining
superior visual quality, temporal consistency, and scalability. The code will
be publicly available. We believe this work will open new avenues for
video-based hairstyle transfer and establish a robust baseline in this field.

Motivation: UMIS在多尺度结构异质性和器官间关系建模方面存在挑战，传统像素级方法效果有限。

Method: Mamba Snake采用层次状态空间图谱建模多轮廓演化，引入Mamba Evolution Block（MEB）模块和能量图形状先验，结合双分类协同机制优化检测与分割。

Result: 在五个临床数据集上的评估显示，Mamba Snake的平均Dice得分比现有最优方法提高了3%。

Conclusion: Mamba Snake通过状态空间建模和双分类协同机制，显著提升了UMIS的性能，适用于复杂形态的分割任务。

Abstract: Unified Medical Image Segmentation (UMIS) is critical for comprehensive
anatomical assessment but faces challenges due to multi-scale structural
heterogeneity. Conventional pixel-based approaches, lacking object-level
anatomical insight and inter-organ relational modeling, struggle with
morphological complexity and feature conflicts, limiting their efficacy in
UMIS. We propose Mamba Snake, a novel deep snake framework enhanced by state
space modeling for UMIS. Mamba Snake frames multi-contour evolution as a
hierarchical state space atlas, effectively modeling macroscopic inter-organ
topological relationships and microscopic contour refinements. We introduce a
snake-specific vision state space module, the Mamba Evolution Block (MEB),
which leverages effective spatiotemporal information aggregation for adaptive
refinement of complex morphologies. Energy map shape priors further ensure
robust long-range contour evolution in heterogeneous data. Additionally, a
dual-classification synergy mechanism is incorporated to concurrently optimize
detection and segmentation, mitigating under-segmentation of microstructures in
UMIS. Extensive evaluations across five clinical datasets reveal Mamba Snake's
superior performance, with an average Dice improvement of 3\% over
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Emotional talking-head generation has emerged as a pivotal research area at
the intersection of computer vision and multimodal artificial intelligence,
with its core value lying in enhancing human-computer interaction through
immersive and empathetic engagement.With the advancement of multimodal large
language models, the driving signals for emotional talking-head generation has
shifted from audio and video to more flexible text. However, current
text-driven methods rely on predefined discrete emotion label texts,
oversimplifying the dynamic complexity of real facial muscle movements and thus
failing to achieve natural emotional expressiveness.This study proposes the
Think-Before-Draw framework to address two key challenges: (1) In-depth
semantic parsing of emotions--by innovatively introducing Chain-of-Thought
(CoT), abstract emotion labels are transformed into physiologically grounded
facial muscle movement descriptions, enabling the mapping from high-level
semantics to actionable motion features; and (2) Fine-grained expressiveness
optimization--inspired by artists' portrait painting process, a progressive
guidance denoising strategy is proposed, employing a "global emotion
localization--local muscle control" mechanism to refine micro-expression
dynamics in generated videos.Our experiments demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on widely-used benchmarks, including MEAD
and HDTF. Additionally, we collected a set of portrait images to evaluate our
model's zero-shot generation capability.

Abstract: Reliable anticipation of traffic accidents is essential for advancing
autonomous driving systems. However, this objective is limited by two
fundamental challenges: the scarcity of diverse, high-quality training data and
the frequent absence of crucial object-level cues due to environmental
disruptions or sensor deficiencies. To tackle these issues, we propose a
comprehensive framework combining generative scene augmentation with adaptive
temporal reasoning. Specifically, we develop a video generation pipeline that
utilizes a world model guided by domain-informed prompts to create
high-resolution, statistically consistent driving scenarios, particularly
enriching the coverage of edge cases and complex interactions. In parallel, we
construct a dynamic prediction model that encodes spatio-temporal relationships
through strengthened graph convolutions and dilated temporal operators,
effectively addressing data incompleteness and transient visual noise.
Furthermore, we release a new benchmark dataset designed to better capture
diverse real-world driving risks. Extensive experiments on public and newly
released datasets confirm that our framework enhances both the accuracy and
lead time of accident anticipation, offering a robust solution to current data
and modeling limitations in safety-critical autonomous driving applications.

Conclusion: 任务无关范式ATARA和AnyPos模型显著提升数据效率和任务性能，适用于多样化操作任务。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise on task-conditioned
control in complex settings such as bimanual manipulation. However, the heavy
reliance on task-specific human demonstrations limits their generalization and
incurs high data acquisition costs. In this work, we present a new notion of
task-agnostic action paradigm that decouples action execution from
task-specific conditioning, enhancing scalability, efficiency, and
cost-effectiveness. To address the data collection challenges posed by this
paradigm -- such as low coverage density, behavioral redundancy, and safety
risks -- we introduce ATARA (Automated Task-Agnostic Random Actions), a
scalable self-supervised framework that accelerates collection by over $
30\times $ compared to human teleoperation. To further enable effective
learning from task-agnostic data, which often suffers from distribution
mismatch and irrelevant trajectories, we propose AnyPos, an inverse dynamics
model equipped with Arm-Decoupled Estimation and a Direction-Aware Decoder
(DAD). We additionally integrate a video-conditioned action validation module
to verify the feasibility of learned policies across diverse manipulation
tasks. Extensive experiments show that the AnyPos-ATARA pipeline yields a 51%
improvement in test accuracy and achieves 30-40% higher success rates in
downstream tasks such as lifting, pick-and-place, and clicking, using
replay-based video validation. Project Page:

Result: 实验显示ReToM在FID上提升6.2%，CLIP分数更高，同时保持推理时间接近基线。

Conclusion: ReToM在视觉质量和计算效率之间取得了良好平衡，适用于任何基于注意力的图像生成模型。

Abstract: Stable diffusion is an outstanding image generation model for text-to-image,
but its time-consuming generation process remains a challenge due to the
quadratic complexity of attention operations. Recent token merging methods
improve efficiency by reducing the number of tokens during attention
operations, but often overlook the characteristics of attention-based image
generation models, limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose
local representative token guided merging (ReToM), a novel token merging
strategy applicable to any attention mechanism in image generation. To merge
tokens based on various contextual information, ReToM defines local boundaries
as windows within attention inputs and adjusts window sizes. Furthermore, we
introduce a representative token, which represents the most representative
token per window by computing similarity at a specific timestep and selecting
the token with the highest average similarity. This approach preserves the most
salient local features while minimizing computational overhead. Experimental
results show that ReToM achieves a 6.2% improvement in FID and higher CLIP
scores compared to the baseline, while maintaining comparable inference time.
We empirically demonstrate that ReToM is effective in balancing visual quality
and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: KCR-Transformer是一种高效且理论支持的视觉Transformer改进方法。

Abstract: Self-attention and transformer architectures have become foundational
components in modern deep learning. Recent efforts have integrated transformer
blocks into compact neural architectures for computer vision, giving rise to
various efficient vision transformers. In this work, we introduce Transformer
with Kernel Complexity Reduction, or KCR-Transformer, a compact transformer
block equipped with differentiable channel selection, guided by a novel and
sharp theoretical generalization bound. KCR-Transformer performs input/output
channel selection in the MLP layers of transformer blocks to reduce the
computational cost. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis
establishing a tight generalization bound for networks equipped with
KCR-Transformer blocks. Leveraging such strong theoretical results, the channel
pruning by KCR-Transformer is conducted in a generalization-aware manner,
ensuring that the resulting network retains a provably small generalization
error. Our KCR-Transformer is compatible with many popular and compact
transformer networks, such as ViT and Swin, and it reduces the FLOPs of the
vision transformers while maintaining or even improving the prediction
accuracy. In the experiments, we replace all the transformer blocks in the
vision transformers with KCR-Transformer blocks, leading to KCR-Transformer
networks with different backbones. The resulting TCR-Transformers achieve
superior performance on various computer vision tasks, achieving even better
performance than the original models with even less FLOPs and parameters.

Conclusion: City-VLM在多种户外场景中表现出实用性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Scene understanding enables intelligent agents to interpret and comprehend
their environment. While existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) for
scene understanding have primarily focused on indoor household tasks, they face
two significant limitations when applied to outdoor large-scale scene
understanding. First, outdoor scenarios typically encompass larger-scale
environments observed through various sensors from multiple viewpoints (e.g.,
bird view and terrestrial view), while existing indoor LVLMs mainly analyze
single visual modalities within building-scale contexts from humanoid
viewpoints. Second, existing LVLMs suffer from missing multidomain perception
outdoor data and struggle to effectively integrate 2D and 3D visual
information. To address the aforementioned limitations, we build the first
multidomain perception outdoor scene understanding dataset, named
\textbf{\underline{SVM-City}}, deriving from multi\textbf{\underline{S}}cale
scenarios with multi\textbf{\underline{V}}iew and
multi\textbf{\underline{M}}odal instruction tuning data. It contains $420$k
images and $4, 811$M point clouds with $567$k question-answering pairs from
vehicles, low-altitude drones, high-altitude aerial planes, and satellite. To
effectively fuse the multimodal data in the absence of one modality, we
introduce incomplete multimodal learning to model outdoor scene understanding
and design the LVLM named \textbf{\underline{City-VLM}}. Multimodal fusion is
realized by constructing a joint probabilistic distribution space rather than
implementing directly explicit fusion operations (e.g., concatenation).
Experimental results on three typical outdoor scene understanding tasks show
City-VLM achieves $18.14 \%$ performance surpassing existing LVLMs in
question-answering tasks averagely. Our method demonstrates pragmatic and
generalization performance across multiple outdoor scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文档质量评估方法准确性不足，限制了实际应用。MLLM在图像质量评估中的成功启发其扩展到文档领域。

Method: 通过调整DeQA-Score，提出DeQA-Doc框架，利用MLLM的视觉语言能力和软标签策略，支持高分辨率文档图像，并采用集成方法提升性能。

Result: 实验表明DeQA-Doc在多种退化类型下表现优异，提供准确且通用的文档质量评估。

Conclusion: DeQA-Doc为文档质量评估提供了高效解决方案，代码和模型权重已开源。

Abstract: Document quality assessment is critical for a wide range of applications
including document digitization, OCR, and archival. However, existing
approaches often struggle to provide accurate and robust quality scores,
limiting their applicability in practical scenarios. With the rapid progress in
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), recent MLLM-based methods have
achieved remarkable performance in image quality assessment. In this work, we
extend this success to the document domain by adapting DeQA-Score, a
state-of-the-art MLLM-based image quality scorer, for document quality
assessment. We propose DeQA-Doc, a framework that leverages the visual language
capabilities of MLLMs and a soft label strategy to regress continuous document
quality scores. To adapt DeQA-Score to DeQA-Doc, we adopt two complementary
solutions to construct soft labels without the variance information. Also, we
relax the resolution constrains to support the large resolution of document
images. Finally, we introduce ensemble methods to further enhance the
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeQA-Doc significantly
outperforms existing baselines, offering accurate and generalizable document
quality assessment across diverse degradation types. Codes and model weights

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Sage的新方法，通过语义引导微调基础模型，以解决长尾视觉识别中的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长尾场景中类别样本量的不均衡导致低频类别性能下降，而基础模型因其通用表示能力具有潜力。现有方法忽视视觉与文本对齐，需改进。

Method: 提出Sage方法，引入SG-Adapter将类描述作为语义引导，通过注意力机制增强视觉与文本对齐，并提出分布不匹配感知补偿因子修正预测偏差。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，Sage有效提升了长尾学习性能。

Conclusion: Sage通过语义引导和分布补偿，显著提升了长尾视觉识别的性能。

Abstract: The variance in class-wise sample sizes within long-tailed scenarios often
results in degraded performance in less frequent classes. Fortunately,
foundation models, pre-trained on vast open-world datasets, demonstrate strong
potential for this task due to their generalizable representation, which
promotes the development of adaptive strategies on pre-trained models in
long-tailed learning. Advanced fine-tuning methods typically adjust visual
encoders while neglecting the semantics derived from the frozen text encoder,
overlooking the visual and textual alignment. To strengthen this alignment, we
propose a novel approach, Semantic-guided fine-tuning of foundation model for
long-tailed visual recognition (Sage), which incorporates semantic guidance
derived from textual modality into the visual fine-tuning process.
Specifically, we introduce an SG-Adapter that integrates class descriptions as
semantic guidance to guide the fine-tuning of the visual encoder. The
introduced guidance is passesed through the attention mechanism and enables the
model to focus more on semantically relevant content, strengthening the
alignment between the visual and textual modalities. Due to the inconsistent
class-conditional distributions neglected by the existing loss function, the
resulting prediction bias causes performance improvements for the tail class
less than for the head class, even when the multi-modal alignment is enhanced.
To address this challenge, we propose a novel distribution mismatch-aware
compensation factor, which is specifically designed to rectify the prediction
bias caused by the ignored inconsistent distribution based on our theoretical
analysis, and is seamlessly integrated into the loss function. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
Sage in enhancing performance in long-tailed learning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FIQ的新方法，通过生成基础问题与答案对来增强视频问答模型的推理能力，并结合视觉特征提升任务适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA方法主要依赖事件中心的Q&A对，缺乏对视频中对象类型、空间布局等基础信息的捕捉，限制了模型的泛化和推理能力。

Method: FIQ通过从视频中提取描述生成Q&A对，并结合VQ-CAlign模块将任务特定问题嵌入与视觉特征对齐。

Result: 在SUTD-TrafficQA数据集上，FIQ表现优于现有基线方法，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: FIQ通过增强对视频基础信息的理解，显著提升了模型的泛化能力和推理能力。

Abstract: Video question answering (VQA) is a multimodal task that requires the
interpretation of a video to answer a given question. Existing VQA methods
primarily utilize question and answer (Q&A) pairs to learn the spatio-temporal
characteristics of video content. However, these annotations are typically
event-centric, which is not enough to capture the broader context of each
video. The absence of essential details such as object types, spatial layouts,
and descriptive attributes restricts the model to learning only a fragmented
scene representation. This issue limits the model's capacity for generalization
and higher-level reasoning. In this paper, we propose a fundamental question
generation with the integration of question embeddings for video question
answering (FIQ), a novel approach designed to strengthen the reasoning ability
of the model by enhancing the fundamental understanding of videos. FIQ
generates Q&A pairs based on descriptions extracted from videos, enriching the
training data with fundamental scene information. Generated Q&A pairs enable
the model to understand the primary context, leading to enhanced
generalizability and reasoning ability. Furthermore, we incorporate a VQ-CAlign
module that assists task-specific question embeddings with visual features,
ensuring that essential domain-specific details are preserved to increase the
adaptability of downstream tasks. Experiments on SUTD-TrafficQA demonstrate
that our FIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing
baseline methods.

TL;DR: MCoT-RE是一种无需训练的零样本CIR框架，通过多角度思维链和重排序，平衡文本修改与视觉上下文，显著提升检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本CIR方法存在信息丢失或视觉上下文利用不足的问题，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 提出MCoT-RE框架，结合多角度思维链生成两种描述，并通过两阶段重排序实现精确检索。

Result: 在FashionIQ和CIRR数据集上，Recall@10和Recall@1分别提升6.24%和8.58%。

Conclusion: MCoT-RE在无需训练的情况下实现了最先进的性能，为CIR任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is the task of retrieving a target image from
a gallery using a composed query consisting of a reference image and a
modification text. Among various CIR approaches, training-free zero-shot
methods based on pre-trained models are cost-effective but still face notable
limitations. For example, sequential VLM-LLM pipelines process each modality
independently, which often results in information loss and limits cross-modal
interaction. In contrast, methods based on multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) often focus exclusively on applying changes indicated by the text,
without fully utilizing the contextual visual information from the reference
image. To address these issues, we propose multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought with
re-ranking (MCoT-RE), a training-free zero-shot CIR framework. MCoT-RE utilizes
multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought to guide the MLLM to balance explicit
modifications and contextual visual cues, generating two distinct captions: one
focused on modification and the other integrating comprehensive visual-textual
context. The first caption is used to filter candidate images. Subsequently, we
combine these two captions and the reference image to perform multi-grained
re-ranking. This two-stage approach facilitates precise retrieval by aligning
with the textual modification instructions while preserving the visual context
of the reference image. Through extensive experiments, MCoT-RE achieves
state-of-the-art results among training-free methods, yielding improvements of
up to 6.24% in Recall@10 on FashionIQ and 8.58% in Recall@1 on CIRR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在组合图像检索中采用早期或晚期融合，但早期融合忽视视觉上下文，晚期融合难以捕捉细粒度语义对齐。

Method: FAR-Net包含增强语义对齐模块（ESAM）和自适应协调模块（ARM），分别采用晚期和早期融合策略，结合交叉注意力和不确定性嵌入。

Result: 在CIRR和FashionIQ数据集上，FAR-Net显著提升了性能，Recall@1提高了2.4%，Recall@50提高了1.04%。

Conclusion: FAR-Net为组合图像检索任务提供了鲁棒且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Composed image retrieval (CIR) is a vision language task that retrieves a
target image using a reference image and modification text, enabling intuitive
specification of desired changes. While effectively fusing visual and textual
modalities is crucial, existing methods typically adopt either early or late
fusion. Early fusion tends to excessively focus on explicitly mentioned textual
details and neglect visual context, whereas late fusion struggles to capture
fine-grained semantic alignments between image regions and textual tokens. To
address these issues, we propose FAR-Net, a multi-stage fusion framework
designed with enhanced semantic alignment and adaptive reconciliation,
integrating two complementary modules. The enhanced semantic alignment module
(ESAM) employs late fusion with cross-attention to capture fine-grained
semantic relationships, while the adaptive reconciliation module (ARM) applies
early fusion with uncertainty embeddings to enhance robustness and
adaptability. Experiments on CIRR and FashionIQ show consistent performance
gains, improving Recall@1 by up to 2.4% and Recall@50 by 1.04% over existing
state-of-the-art methods, empirically demonstrating that FAR Net provides a
robust and scalable solution to CIR tasks.

demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority in fine-grained food image
classification.

Abstract: Small Multi-Object Tracking (SMOT) is particularly challenging when targets
occupy only a few dozen pixels, rendering detection and appearance-based
association unreliable. Building on the success of the MVA2023 SOD4SB
challenge, this paper introduces the SMOT4SB challenge, which leverages
temporal information to address limitations of single-frame detection. Our
three main contributions are: (1) the SMOT4SB dataset, consisting of 211 UAV
video sequences with 108,192 annotated frames under diverse real-world
conditions, designed to capture motion entanglement where both camera and
targets move freely in 3D; (2) SO-HOTA, a novel metric combining Dot Distance
with HOTA to mitigate the sensitivity of IoU-based metrics to small
displacements; and (3) a competitive MVA2025 challenge with 78 participants and
308 submissions, where the winning method achieved a 5.1x improvement over the
baseline. This work lays a foundation for advancing SMOT in UAV scenarios with
applications in bird strike avoidance, agriculture, fisheries, and ecological

Abstract: Controllable captioning is essential for precise multimodal alignment and
instruction following, yet existing models often lack fine-grained control and
reliable evaluation protocols. To address this gap, we present the AnyCap
Project, an integrated solution spanning model, dataset, and evaluation. We
introduce AnyCapModel (ACM), a lightweight plug-and-play framework that
enhances the controllability of existing foundation models for omni-modal
captioning without retraining the base model. ACM reuses the original captions
from base models while incorporating user instructions and modality features to
generate improved captions. To remedy the data scarcity in controllable
multimodal captioning, we build AnyCapDataset (ACD), covering three modalities,
28 user-instruction types, and 300\,k high-quality data entries. We further
propose AnyCapEval, a new benchmark that provides more reliable evaluation
metrics for controllable captioning by decoupling content accuracy and
stylistic fidelity. ACM markedly improves caption quality across a diverse set
of base models on AnyCapEval. Notably, ACM-8B raises GPT-4o\'s content scores
by 45\% and style scores by 12\%, and it also achieves substantial gains on
widely used benchmarks such as MIA-Bench and VidCapBench.

of descriptive text from visual content. In the context of remote sensing,
image captioning plays a significant role in interpreting vast and complex

We evaluate our proposed models using two benchmark remote sensing image

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，SRE优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SRE通过注意力重聚焦有效提升了CLIP在领域泛化中的表现。

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) aims to learn a model from source domains and
apply it to unseen target domains with out-of-distribution data. Owing to
CLIP's strong ability to encode semantic concepts, it has attracted increasing
interest in domain generalization. However, CLIP often struggles to focus on
task-relevant regions across domains, i.e., domain-invariant regions, resulting
in suboptimal performance on unseen target domains. To address this challenge,
we propose an attention-refocusing scheme, called Simulate, Refocus and
Ensemble (SRE), which learns to reduce the domain shift by aligning the
attention maps in CLIP via attention refocusing. SRE first simulates domain
shifts by performing augmentation on the source data to generate simulated
target domains. SRE then learns to reduce the domain shifts by refocusing the
attention in CLIP between the source and simulated target domains. Finally, SRE
utilizes ensemble learning to enhance the ability to capture domain-invariant
attention maps between the source data and the simulated target data. Extensive
experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that SRE generally
achieves better results than state-of-the-art methods. The code is available

Abstract: Most existing remote sensing instance segmentation approaches are designed
for close-vocabulary prediction, limiting their ability to recognize novel
categories or generalize across datasets. This restricts their applicability in
diverse Earth observation scenarios. To address this, we introduce
open-vocabulary (OV) learning for remote sensing instance segmentation. While
current OV segmentation models perform well on natural image datasets, their
direct application to remote sensing faces challenges such as diverse
landscapes, seasonal variations, and the presence of small or ambiguous objects
in aerial imagery. To overcome these challenges, we propose $\textbf{SCORE}$
($\textbf{S}$cene $\textbf{C}$ontext matters in $\textbf{O}$pen-vocabulary
$\textbf{RE}$mote sensing instance segmentation), a framework that integrates
multi-granularity scene context, i.e., regional context and global context, to
enhance both visual and textual representations. Specifically, we introduce
Region-Aware Integration, which refines class embeddings with regional context
to improve object distinguishability. Additionally, we propose Global Context
Adaptation, which enriches naive text embeddings with remote sensing global
context, creating a more adaptable and expressive linguistic latent space for
the classifier. We establish new benchmarks for OV remote sensing instance
segmentation across diverse datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that,
our proposed method achieves SOTA performance, which provides a robust solution
for large-scale, real-world geospatial analysis. Our code is available at

Conclusion: HRSeg通过高效的高分辨率感知和增强模块，成功提升了推理分割任务的性能。

Abstract: The reasoning segmentation task involves segmenting objects within an image
by interpreting implicit user instructions, which may encompass subtleties such
as contextual cues and open-world knowledge. Despite significant advancements
made by existing approaches, they remain constrained by low perceptual
resolution, as visual encoders are typically pre-trained at lower resolutions.
Furthermore, simply interpolating the positional embeddings of visual encoders
to enhance perceptual resolution yields only marginal performance improvements
while incurring substantial computational costs. To address this, we propose
HRSeg, an efficient model with high-resolution fine-grained perception. It
features two key innovations: High-Resolution Perception (HRP) and
High-Resolution Enhancement (HRE). The HRP module processes high-resolution
images through cropping, integrating local and global features for
multi-granularity quality. The HRE module enhances mask features by integrating
fine-grained information from high-resolution images, refining their alignment
with text features for precise segmentation. Extensive ablation studies
validate the effectiveness of our modules, while comprehensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate HRSeg's superior performance.

Result: 在7名参与者中验证，平均每顶点误差为25.9毫米，性能与当前最先进的视觉方法相当。

Conclusion: NeckSense展示了生物阻抗可穿戴设备在头部姿态跟踪中的潜力，性能接近视觉方法。

Abstract: We present NeckSense, a novel wearable system for head pose tracking that
leverages multi-channel bio-impedance sensing with soft, dry electrodes
embedded in a lightweight, necklace-style form factor. NeckSense captures
dynamic changes in tissue impedance around the neck, which are modulated by
head rotations and subtle muscle activations. To robustly estimate head pose,
we propose a deep learning framework that integrates anatomical priors,
including joint constraints and natural head rotation ranges, into the loss
function design. We validate NeckSense on 7 participants using the current SOTA
pose estimation model as ground truth. Our system achieves a mean per-vertex
error of 25.9 mm across various head movements with a leave-one-person-out
cross-validation method, demonstrating that a compact, line-of-sight-free
bio-impedance wearable can deliver head-tracking performance comparable to SOTA
vision-based methods.

Motivation: 现有情绪识别方法依赖显式信号（如面部表情）或生理信号，存在易掩盖、侵入性强或忽略环境影响的局限性。

Method: 利用标准高清摄像头捕捉用户眼部外观和头部运动，估计注视轨迹，建模注视行为的空间、语义和时间维度。

Result: 揭示了情绪是人与环境互动的复杂结果，方法具有高通用性和低部署成本。

Conclusion: 该方法为无感知、实时、连续的情绪识别提供了新途径。

Abstract: Emotion recognition,as a step toward mind reading,seeks to infer internal
states from external cues.Most existing methods rely on explicit signals-such
as facial expressions,speech,or gestures-that reflect only bodily responses and
overlook the influence of environmental context.These cues are often
voluntary,easy to mask,and insufficient for capturing deeper,implicit emotions.
Physiological signal-based approaches offer more direct access to internal
states but require complex sensors that compromise natural behavior and limit
scalability.Gaze-based methods typically rely on static fixation analysis and
fail to capture the rich,dynamic interactions between gaze and the
environment,and thus cannot uncover the deep connection between emotion and
implicit behavior.To address these limitations,we propose a novel
camera-based,user-unaware emotion recognition approach that integrates gaze
fixation patterns with environmental semantics and temporal dynamics.Leveraging
standard HD cameras,our method unobtrusively captures users'eye appearance and
head movements in natural settings-without the need for specialized hardware or
active user participation.From these visual cues,the system estimates gaze
trajectories over time and space, providing the basis for modeling the spatial,
semantic,and temporal dimensions of gaze behavior. This allows us to capture
the dynamic interplay between visual attention and the surrounding
environment,revealing that emotions are not merely physiological responses but
complex outcomes of human-environment interactions.The proposed approach
enables user-unaware,real-time,and continuous emotion recognition,offering high
generalizability and low deployment cost.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的车道性能估计框架（LanePerf），用于在无标签情况下评估车道检测模型的性能，解决了领域偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车道检测在ADAS和ADS中至关重要，但领域偏移会降低模型可靠性。传统方法需要大量标注数据，资源消耗大，因此需要一种无标签的性能评估方法。

Method: 本文首先将五种图像分类的性能估计方法适配到车道检测任务中，并提出了LanePerf框架，结合图像和车道特征，使用预训练图像编码器和DeepSets架构。

Result: 在OpenLane数据集上的实验表明，LanePerf在MAE（0.117）和Spearman相关系数（0.727）上优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: LanePerf为ADAS提供了高效的无标签性能评估方法，支持在复杂驾驶场景中提升模型安全性和测试效率。

Abstract: Lane detection is a critical component of Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems
(ADAS) and Automated Driving System (ADS), providing essential spatial
information for lateral control. However, domain shifts often undermine model
reliability when deployed in new environments. Ensuring the robustness and
safety of lane detection models typically requires collecting and annotating
target domain data, which is resource-intensive. Estimating model performance
without ground-truth labels offers a promising alternative for efficient
robustness assessment, yet remains underexplored in lane detection. While
previous work has addressed performance estimation in image classification,
these methods are not directly applicable to lane detection tasks. This paper
first adapts five well-performing performance estimation methods from image
classification to lane detection, building a baseline. Addressing the
limitations of prior approaches that solely rely on softmax scores or lane
features, we further propose a new Lane Performance Estimation Framework
(LanePerf), which integrates image and lane features using a pretrained image
encoder and a DeepSets-based architecture, effectively handling zero-lane
detection scenarios and large domain-shift cases. Extensive experiments on the
OpenLane dataset, covering diverse domain shifts (scenes, weather, hours),
demonstrate that our LanePerf outperforms all baselines, achieving a lower MAE
of 0.117 and a higher Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.727. These
findings pave the way for robust, label-free performance estimation in ADAS,
supporting more efficient testing and improved safety in challenging driving
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型通常使用过多视觉令牌，而实际场景中大部分任务无需如此高分辨率。

Method: 采用动态分辨率处理，结合强化学习和LLM-as-Judge策略，设计奖励函数与惩罚机制。

Result: 在OCR任务中表现优异，同时在简单任务中显著节省视觉令牌。

Conclusion: VisionThink在性能与效率间取得平衡，适用于多样化视觉语言任务。

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved
performance by increasing the number of visual tokens, which are often
significantly longer than text tokens. However, we observe that most real-world
scenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the
performance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models
still perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4
resolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with
different resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression,
namely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides
whether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output
a special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing
Efficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or
thresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by
case. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding
capability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens
on simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge
strategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully
design a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and
reasonable image resize call ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority, efficiency, and effectiveness of our method. Our code is available

Motivation: 联邦学习在保护隐私的同时实现多客户端协作学习，但缺乏专用数据集。本文旨在填补这一空白并改进算法性能。

Method: 提出两种新算法：Fed-Cyclic（循环拓扑）和Fed-Star（星型拓扑），并在新数据集上进行实验。

Result: 两种算法在新数据集上表现优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 新数据集和算法为联邦学习领域提供了有价值的资源和方法。

Abstract: Federated Learning is a collaborative machine learning paradigm that enables
multiple clients to learn a global model without exposing their data to each
other. Consequently, it provides a secure learning platform with
privacy-preserving capabilities. This paper introduces a new dataset containing
23,326 images collected from eight different commercial sources and classified
into 31 categories, similar to the Office-31 dataset. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first image classification dataset specifically designed
for Federated Learning. We also propose two new Federated Learning algorithms,
namely Fed-Cyclic and Fed-Star. In Fed-Cyclic, a client receives weights from
its previous client, updates them through local training, and passes them to
the next client, thus forming a cyclic topology. In Fed-Star, a client receives
weights from all other clients, updates its local weights through
pre-aggregation (to address statistical heterogeneity) and local training, and
sends its updated local weights to all other clients, thus forming a star-like
topology. Our experiments reveal that both algorithms perform better than
existing baselines on our newly introduced dataset.

Motivation: 解决体育分析中缺乏真实运动数据集和单目3D姿态估计可靠性不明确的问题。

Method: 引入AthleticsPose数据集，训练代表性3D姿态估计模型并进行全面评估。

Result: 模型在AthleticsPose上训练后，MPJPE降低约75%，但高速运动指标（如膝部驱动速度）存在预测偏差。

Conclusion: 真实运动数据对模型性能至关重要，单目3D姿态估计在体育分析中具有潜力但也存在局限性。

Abstract: Monocular 3D pose estimation is a promising, flexible alternative to costly
motion capture systems for sports analysis. However, its practical application
is hindered by two factors: a lack of realistic sports datasets and unclear
reliability for sports tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce the
AthleticsPose dataset, a new public dataset featuring ``real'' motions captured
from 23 athletes performing various athletics events on an athletic field.
Using this dataset, we trained a representative 3D pose estimation model and
performed a comprehensive evaluation. Our results show that the model trained
on AthleticsPose significantly outperforms a baseline model trained on an
imitated sports motion dataset, reducing MPJPE by approximately 75 %. These
results show the importance of training on authentic sports motion data, as
models based on imitated motions do not effectively transfer to real-world
motions. Further analysis reveals that estimation accuracy is sensitive to
camera view and subject scale. In case studies of kinematic indicators, the
model demonstrated the potential to capture individual differences in knee
angles but struggled with higher-speed metrics, such as knee-drive velocity,
due to prediction biases. This work provides the research community with a
valuable dataset and clarifies the potential and practical limitations of using
monocular 3D pose estimation for sports motion analysis. Our dataset, code, and
checkpoints are available at https://github.com/SZucchini/AthleticsPose.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D点云重建方法存在信息损失问题，如纹理缺失或复杂结构失真，多视角图像能提供更详细的场景表示。

Method: Argus通过融合多视角图像和相机姿态生成场景特征，与3D特征交互，创建全面的3D感知场景嵌入。

Result: 实验表明，Argus在多种下游任务中优于现有3D-LMMs。

Conclusion: Argus扩展了LLMs的3D任务能力，有效解决了3D点云重建的信息损失问题。

Abstract: Advancements in foundation models have made it possible to conduct
applications in various downstream tasks. Especially, the new era has witnessed
a remarkable capability to extend Large Language Models (LLMs) for tackling
tasks of 3D scene understanding. Current methods rely heavily on 3D point
clouds, but the 3D point cloud reconstruction of an indoor scene often results
in information loss. Some textureless planes or repetitive patterns are prone
to omission and manifest as voids within the reconstructed 3D point clouds.
Besides, objects with complex structures tend to introduce distortion of
details caused by misalignments between the captured images and the dense
reconstructed point clouds. 2D multi-view images present visual consistency
with 3D point clouds and provide more detailed representations of scene
components, which can naturally compensate for these deficiencies. Based on
these insights, we propose Argus, a novel 3D multimodal framework that
leverages multi-view images for enhanced 3D scene understanding with LLMs. In
general, Argus can be treated as a 3D Large Multimodal Foundation Model
(3D-LMM) since it takes various modalities as input(text instructions, 2D
multi-view images, and 3D point clouds) and expands the capability of LLMs to
tackle 3D tasks. Argus involves fusing and integrating multi-view images and
camera poses into view-as-scene features, which interact with the 3D features
to create comprehensive and detailed 3D-aware scene embeddings. Our approach
compensates for the information loss while reconstructing 3D point clouds and
helps LLMs better understand the 3D world. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method outperforms existing 3D-LMMs in various downstream tasks.

Result: 在W4A6和W4A8等低比特宽度下显著优于现有方法，保持高质量图像生成。

Conclusion: DMQ有效解决了扩散模型量化中的关键问题，提升了性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation but
come with significant computational costs, posing challenges for deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Recent post-training quantization (PTQ)
methods have attempted to mitigate this issue by focusing on the iterative
nature of diffusion models. However, these approaches often overlook outliers,
leading to degraded performance at low bit-widths. In this paper, we propose a
DMQ which combines Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise
Power-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to effectively address these challenges. Learned
Equivalent Scaling optimizes channel-wise scaling factors to redistribute
quantization difficulty between weights and activations, reducing overall
quantization error. Recognizing that early denoising steps, despite having
small quantization errors, crucially impact the final output due to error
accumulation, we incorporate an adaptive timestep weighting scheme to
prioritize these critical steps during learning. Furthermore, identifying that
layers such as skip connections exhibit high inter-channel variance, we
introduce channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling for activations. To ensure robust
selection of PTS factors even with small calibration set, we introduce a voting
algorithm that enhances reliability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing works, especially at low bit-widths
such as W4A6 (4-bit weight, 6-bit activation) and W4A8, maintaining high image
generation quality and model stability. The code is available at

classification performance. The proposed model achieved an F1-score of 0.8938

Abstract: To reduce the reliance of visible-infrared person re-identification (ReID)
models on labeled cross-modal samples, this paper explores a weakly supervised
cross-modal person ReID method that uses only single-modal sample identity
labels, addressing scenarios where cross-modal identity labels are unavailable.
To mitigate the impact of missing cross-modal labels on model performance, we
propose a heterogeneous expert collaborative consistency learning framework,
designed to establish robust cross-modal identity correspondences in a weakly
supervised manner. This framework leverages labeled data from each modality to
independently train dedicated classification experts. To associate cross-modal
samples, these classification experts act as heterogeneous predictors,
predicting the identities of samples from the other modality. To improve
prediction accuracy, we design a cross-modal relationship fusion mechanism that
effectively integrates predictions from different experts. Under the implicit
supervision provided by cross-modal identity correspondences, collaborative and
consistent learning among the experts is encouraged, significantly enhancing
the model's ability to extract modality-invariant features and improve
cross-modal identity recognition. Experimental results on two challenging
datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: MUPM通过量化不确定性关系，为临床提供了高效的多模态数据分析工具，并识别冗余因素，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can process and integrate
information from multimodality sources, such as text and images. However,
interrelationship among input modalities, uncertainties due to individual
uni-modal data and potential clinical applications following such an
uncertainty decomposition are yet fully understood in the context of
large-scale MLLMs. In this work, we propose a multimodal uncertainty
propagation model (MUPM) based on uncertainty propagation, to characterise the
relationship among the uncertainties arising from image-only, text-only, and
joint image-text variations in MLLM inputs. Using real clinical data consisting
of cardiac MR scans and digital health records, we describe that MUPMs can be
optimised robustly with a few samples. We then show that the fitted MUPMs are
generalisable across different input data distributions and, perhaps
surprisingly, across different downstream tasks. Such a transferability may be
explained by the shared pretraining, comparatively light MLLM fine-tuning,
along with the low-dimensional nature of the MUPMs. More importantly, this
learned transferability, quantifying the relationship between these
uncertainties, led to direct clinical applications in which uncertainties may
be estimated and thus analysed robustly for varying data or even a novel set of
cardiac disease prediction tasks. In addition, we show experimentally the
efficiency in multimodal data required for estimating the overall uncertainty
and its ability to identify redundant factors, both of which are considered
practical yet clinically useful applications with the proposed MUPMs. Codes are
available at https://github.com/yucheng722/MUPM.

Motivation: 尽管扩散变换器在文本到视频生成方面取得了进展，但由于自注意力的二次复杂度，生成长视频仍然具有挑战性。现有方法如稀疏注意力和时间自回归模型在时间连贯性或可扩展性上存在不足。

Method: LoViC采用FlexFormer，一种联合压缩视频和文本为统一潜在表示的自动编码器，支持可变长度输入和线性可调压缩率。通过位置感知机制编码时间上下文，支持预测、回溯、插值和多镜头生成。

Result: 在多样化任务上的广泛实验验证了该方法的有效性和多功能性。

Conclusion: LoViC通过创新的分段生成和潜在表示压缩，成功解决了长视频生成的挑战，同时保持了时间连贯性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in diffusion transformers (DiTs) for text-to-video
generation, scaling to long-duration content remains challenging due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. While prior efforts -- such as sparse
attention and temporally autoregressive models -- offer partial relief, they
often compromise temporal coherence or scalability. We introduce LoViC, a
DiT-based framework trained on million-scale open-domain videos, designed to
produce long, coherent videos through a segment-wise generation process. At the
core of our approach is FlexFormer, an expressive autoencoder that jointly
compresses video and text into unified latent representations. It supports
variable-length inputs with linearly adjustable compression rates, enabled by a
single query token design based on the Q-Former architecture. Additionally, by
encoding temporal context through position-aware mechanisms, our model
seamlessly supports prediction, retradiction, interpolation, and multi-shot
generation within a unified paradigm. Extensive experiments across diverse
tasks validate the effectiveness and versatility of our approach.

Result: 在DIR-LAB数据集上评估，cIDIR表现出高精度和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: cIDIR提供了一种高效且灵活的正则化参数调优方法，适用于可变形图像配准。

Abstract: Regularization is essential in deformable image registration (DIR) to ensure
that the estimated Deformation Vector Field (DVF) remains smooth, physically
plausible, and anatomically consistent. However, fine-tuning regularization
parameters in learning-based DIR frameworks is computationally expensive, often
requiring multiple training iterations. To address this, we propose cIDI, a
novel DIR framework based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that
conditions the registration process on regularization hyperparameters. Unlike
conventional methods that require retraining for each regularization
hyperparameter setting, cIDIR is trained over a prior distribution of these
hyperparameters, then optimized over the regularization hyperparameters by
using the segmentations masks as an observation. Additionally, cIDIR models a
continuous and differentiable DVF, enabling seamless integration of advanced
regularization techniques via automatic differentiation. Evaluated on the
DIR-LAB dataset, $\operatorname{cIDIR}$ achieves high accuracy and robustness
across the dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖显式几何先验（如面部标志或3DMM），在跨重演中易产生伪影且难以捕捉细微情感，同时缺乏多角色动画支持。

Method: 采用扩散变换器框架，引入表达增强学习策略和掩码交叉注意力机制，以隐式表示捕捉面部动态并防止特征干扰。

Result: FantasyPortrait在定量和定性评估中显著优于现有方法，尤其在跨重演和多角色场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: FantasyPortrait为高保真情感动画生成提供了有效解决方案，并推动了多角色动画研究的发展。

Abstract: Producing expressive facial animations from static images is a challenging
task. Prior methods relying on explicit geometric priors (e.g., facial
landmarks or 3DMM) often suffer from artifacts in cross reenactment and
struggle to capture subtle emotions. Furthermore, existing approaches lack
support for multi-character animation, as driving features from different
individuals frequently interfere with one another, complicating the task. To
address these challenges, we propose FantasyPortrait, a diffusion transformer
based framework capable of generating high-fidelity and emotion-rich animations
for both single- and multi-character scenarios. Our method introduces an
expression-augmented learning strategy that utilizes implicit representations
to capture identity-agnostic facial dynamics, enhancing the model's ability to
render fine-grained emotions. For multi-character control, we design a masked
cross-attention mechanism that ensures independent yet coordinated expression
generation, effectively preventing feature interference. To advance research in
this area, we propose the Multi-Expr dataset and ExprBench, which are
specifically designed datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating
multi-character portrait animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FantasyPortrait significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both
quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, excelling particularly in
challenging cross reenactment and multi-character contexts. Our project page is

Abstract: Wrist pathologies are frequently observed, particularly among children who
constitute the majority of fracture cases. However, diagnosing these conditions
is time-consuming and requires specialized expertise. Computer vision presents
a promising avenue, contingent upon the availability of extensive datasets, a
notable challenge in medical imaging. Therefore, reliance solely on one
modality, such as images, proves inadequate, especially in an era of diverse
and plentiful data types. In this study, we employ a multifaceted approach to
address the challenge of recognizing wrist pathologies using an extremely
limited dataset. Initially, we approach the problem as a fine-grained
recognition task, aiming to identify subtle X-ray pathologies that conventional
CNNs overlook. Secondly, we enhance network performance by fusing patient
metadata with X-ray images. Thirdly, rather than pre-training on a
coarse-grained dataset like ImageNet, we utilize weights trained on a
fine-grained dataset. While metadata integration has been used in other medical
domains, this is a novel application for wrist pathologies. Our results show
that a fine-grained strategy and metadata integration improve diagnostic
accuracy by 2% with a limited dataset and by over 10% with a larger
fracture-focused dataset.

### [91] [RGB Pre-Training Enhanced Unobservable Feature Latent Diffusion Model for Spectral Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12967)
*Keli Deng,Jie Nie,Yuntao Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于预训练RGB-LDM的两阶段方法，通过光谱不可观测特征建模，实现了从RGB图像到高光谱图像的高效重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像重建的关键难点在于估计RGB传感器未捕获的光谱信息，需要有效构建光谱-空间联合分布。

Method: 扩展RGB-LDM为不可观测特征LDM（ULDM），分两阶段学习光谱结构和光谱-空间联合分布。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在高光谱重建和下游任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 通过分离不可观测特征并利用预训练模型的空间知识，ULDM在紧凑潜在空间中高效学习了联合分布。

Abstract: Spectral reconstruction (SR) is a crucial problem in image processing that
requires reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSIs) from the corresponding RGB
images. A key difficulty in SR is estimating the unobservable feature, which
encapsulates significant spectral information not captured by RGB imaging
sensors. The solution lies in effectively constructing the spectral-spatial
joint distribution conditioned on the RGB image to complement the unobservable
feature. Since HSIs share a similar spatial structure with the corresponding
RGB images, it is rational to capitalize on the rich spatial knowledge in RGB
pre-trained models for spectral-spatial joint distribution learning. To this
end, we extend the RGB pre-trained latent diffusion model (RGB-LDM) to an
unobservable feature LDM (ULDM) for SR. As the RGB-LDM and its corresponding
spatial autoencoder (SpaAE) already excel in spatial knowledge, the ULDM can
focus on modeling spectral structure. Moreover, separating the unobservable
feature from the HSI reduces the redundant spectral information and empowers
the ULDM to learn the joint distribution in a compact latent space.
Specifically, we propose a two-stage pipeline consisting of spectral structure
representation learning and spectral-spatial joint distribution learning to
transform the RGB-LDM into the ULDM. In the first stage, a spectral
unobservable feature autoencoder (SpeUAE) is trained to extract and compress
the unobservable feature into a 3D manifold aligned with RGB space. In the
second stage, the spectral and spatial structures are sequentially encoded by
the SpeUAE and the SpaAE, respectively. The ULDM is then acquired to model the
distribution of the coded unobservable feature with guidance from the
corresponding RGB images. Experimental results on SR and downstream relighting
tasks demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于方差的剪枝方法，用于高效压缩预训练模型，减少计算和内存需求，同时最小化微调成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型模型（如Vision Transformers）的训练成本高昂，且部署时面临延迟、计算和内存问题。现有结构化剪枝方法需要大量重新训练，导致效率低下。

Method: 提出Variance-Based Pruning方法，通过收集激活统计信息选择剪枝神经元，并将均值激活重新整合以保持性能。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k任务中，剪枝后的DeiT-Base模型在仅需10轮微调后恢复99%原始精度，同时减少35%计算量和36%模型大小，速度提升1.44倍。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高性能的同时显著降低了模型的计算和存储需求，适用于资源受限的硬件部署。

Abstract: Increasingly expensive training of ever larger models such as Vision
Transfomers motivate reusing the vast library of already trained
state-of-the-art networks. However, their latency, high computational costs and
memory demands pose significant challenges for deployment, especially on
resource-constrained hardware. While structured pruning methods can reduce
these factors, they often require costly retraining, sometimes for up to
hundreds of epochs, or even training from scratch to recover the lost accuracy
resulting from the structural modifications. Maintaining the provided
performance of trained models after structured pruning and thereby avoiding
extensive retraining remains a challenge. To solve this, we introduce
Variance-Based Pruning, a simple and structured one-shot pruning technique for
efficiently compressing networks, with minimal finetuning. Our approach first
gathers activation statistics, which are used to select neurons for pruning.
Simultaneously the mean activations are integrated back into the model to
preserve a high degree of performance. On ImageNet-1k recognition tasks, we
demonstrate that directly after pruning DeiT-Base retains over 70% of its
original performance and requires only 10 epochs of fine-tuning to regain 99%
of the original accuracy while simultaneously reducing MACs by 35% and model
size by 36%, thus speeding up the model by 1.44x.

Conclusion: DISSect通过差分信息有效解决了噪声对应问题，显著提升了训练效率。

Abstract: The remarkable success of contrastive-learning-based multimodal models has
been greatly driven by training on ever-larger datasets with expensive compute
consumption. Sample selection as an alternative efficient paradigm plays an
important direction to accelerate the training process. However, recent
advances on sample selection either mostly rely on an oracle model to offline
select a high-quality coreset, which is limited in the cold-start scenarios, or
focus on online selection based on real-time model predictions, which has not
sufficiently or efficiently considered the noisy correspondence. To address
this dilemma, we propose a novel Differential-Informed Sample Selection
(DISSect) method, which accurately and efficiently discriminates the noisy
correspondence for training acceleration. Specifically, we rethink the impact
of noisy correspondence on contrastive learning and propose that the
differential between the predicted correlation of the current model and that of
a historical model is more informative to characterize sample quality. Based on
this, we construct a robust differential-based sample selection and analyze its
theoretical insights. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and
various downstream tasks demonstrate the consistent superiority of DISSect over
current state-of-the-art methods. Source code is available at:

Abstract: Deep learning-based image manipulation localization (IML) methods have
achieved remarkable performance in recent years, but typically rely on
large-scale pixel-level annotated datasets. To address the challenge of
acquiring high-quality annotations, some recent weakly supervised methods
utilize image-level labels to segment manipulated regions. However, the
performance is still limited due to insufficient supervision signals. In this
study, we explore a form of weak supervision that improves the annotation
efficiency and detection performance, namely scribble annotation supervision.
We re-annotated mainstream IML datasets with scribble labels and propose the
first scribble-based IML (Sc-IML) dataset. Additionally, we propose the first
scribble-based weakly supervised IML framework. Specifically, we employ
self-supervised training with a structural consistency loss to encourage the
model to produce consistent predictions under multi-scale and augmented inputs.
In addition, we propose a prior-aware feature modulation module (PFMM) that
adaptively integrates prior information from both manipulated and authentic
regions for dynamic feature adjustment, further enhancing feature
discriminability and prediction consistency in complex scenes. We also propose
a gated adaptive fusion module (GAFM) that utilizes gating mechanisms to
regulate information flow during feature fusion, guiding the model toward
emphasizing potential tampered regions. Finally, we propose a confidence-aware
entropy minimization loss (${\mathcal{L}}_{ {CEM }}$). This loss dynamically
regularizes predictions in weakly annotated or unlabeled regions based on model
uncertainty, effectively suppressing unreliable predictions. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms existing fully supervised approaches
in terms of average performance both in-distribution and out-of-distribution.

Conclusion: MaskGIL成功提升MAR模型性能，扩展了应用场景，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: AutoRegressive (AR) models have made notable progress in image generation,
with Masked AutoRegressive (MAR) models gaining attention for their efficient
parallel decoding. However, MAR models have traditionally underperformed when
compared to standard AR models. This study refines the MAR architecture to
improve image generation quality. We begin by evaluating various image
tokenizers to identify the most effective one. Subsequently, we introduce an
improved Bidirectional LLaMA architecture by replacing causal attention with
bidirectional attention and incorporating 2D RoPE, which together form our
advanced model, MaskGIL. Scaled from 111M to 1.4B parameters, MaskGIL achieves
a FID score of 3.71, matching state-of-the-art AR models in the ImageNet
256x256 benchmark, while requiring only 8 inference steps compared to the 256
steps of AR models. Furthermore, we develop a text-driven MaskGIL model with
775M parameters for generating images from text at various resolutions. Beyond
image generation, MaskGIL extends to accelerate AR-based generation and enable
real-time speech-to-image conversion. Our codes and models are available at

Conclusion: HCS是一种即插即用的方法，适用于任何VLM，能有效提升复杂场景理解能力。

Abstract: Scene understanding is one of the core tasks in computer vision, aiming to
extract semantic information from images to identify objects, scene categories,
and their interrelationships. Although advancements in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have driven progress in this field, existing VLMs still face challenges
in adaptation to unseen complex wide-area scenes. To address the challenges,
this paper proposes a Hierarchical Coresets Selection (HCS) mechanism to
advance the adaptation of VLMs in complex wide-area scene understanding. It
progressively refines the selected regions based on the proposed theoretically
guaranteed importance function, which considers utility, representativeness,
robustness, and synergy. Without requiring additional fine-tuning, HCS enables
VLMs to achieve rapid understandings of unseen scenes at any scale using
minimal interpretable regions while mitigating insufficient feature density.
HCS is a plug-and-play method that is compatible with any VLM. Experiments
demonstrate that HCS achieves superior performance and universality in various
tasks.

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了标签不一致和图像质量问题，提升了数据集蒸馏的性能。

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) aims to generate a compact yet informative dataset
that achieves performance comparable to the original dataset, thereby reducing
demands on storage and computational resources. Although diffusion models have
made significant progress in dataset distillation, the generated surrogate
datasets often contain samples with label inconsistencies or insufficient
structural detail, leading to suboptimal downstream performance. To address
these issues, we propose a detector-guided dataset distillation framework that
explicitly leverages a pre-trained detector to identify and refine anomalous
synthetic samples, thereby ensuring label consistency and improving image
quality. Specifically, a detector model trained on the original dataset is
employed to identify anomalous images exhibiting label mismatches or low
classification confidence. For each defective image, multiple candidates are
generated using a pre-trained diffusion model conditioned on the corresponding
image prototype and label. The optimal candidate is then selected by jointly
considering the detector's confidence score and dissimilarity to existing
qualified synthetic samples, thereby ensuring both label accuracy and
intra-class diversity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can
synthesize high-quality representative images with richer details, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on the validation set.

Motivation: 在安全关键的机器人应用中，实时准确检测动态对象至关重要。现有方法因使用多个子网络导致计算成本高，影响实时性能。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的通道级运动特征表示方法，仅使用位姿网络提取深度特征和3D运动信息，无需其他子网络。

Result: 在KITTI和Cityscapes数据集上，FPS提升约4倍，参数减少至25%，同时保持等效精度。

Conclusion: 该方法在高效性和准确性上取得了显著平衡，适用于实时安全关键应用。

Abstract: For safety-critical robotics applications such as autonomous driving, it is
important to detect all required objects accurately in real-time. Motion
segmentation offers a solution by identifying dynamic objects from the scene in
a class-agnostic manner. Recently, various motion segmentation models have been
proposed, most of which jointly use subnetworks to estimate Depth, Pose,
Optical Flow, and Scene Flow. As a result, the overall computational cost of
the model increases, hindering real-time performance.
  In this paper, we propose a novel cost-volume-based motion feature
representation, Channel-wise Motion Features. By extracting depth features of
each instance in the feature map and capturing the scene's 3D motion
information, it offers enhanced efficiency. The only subnetwork used to build
Channel-wise Motion Features is the Pose Network, and no others are required.
Our method not only achieves about 4 times the FPS of state-of-the-art models
in the KITTI Dataset and Cityscapes of the VCAS-Motion Dataset, but also
demonstrates equivalent accuracy while reducing the parameters to about 25$\%$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放世界目标检测（OWOD）需要检测未知物体并逐步学习新类别，但缺乏未知物体的标注数据。PROB模型虽无需伪标签，但存在对象性和类别预测的学习冲突。

Method: 提出Decoupled PROB，引入ETOP终止对象性预测以解决冲突，并采用TDQI高效提取已知和未知物体特征。

Result: 在OWOD基准测试中，Decoupled PROB显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Decoupled PROB通过解耦学习任务，有效提升了开放世界目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Open World Object Detection (OWOD) is a challenging computer vision task that
extends standard object detection by (1) detecting and classifying unknown
objects without supervision, and (2) incrementally learning new object classes
without forgetting previously learned ones. The absence of ground truths for
unknown objects makes OWOD tasks particularly challenging. Many methods have
addressed this by using pseudo-labels for unknown objects. The recently
proposed Probabilistic Objectness transformer-based open-world detector (PROB)
is a state-of-the-art model that does not require pseudo-labels for unknown
objects, as it predicts probabilistic objectness. However, this method faces
issues with learning conflicts between objectness and class predictions.
  To address this issue and further enhance performance, we propose a novel
model, Decoupled PROB. Decoupled PROB introduces Early Termination of
Objectness Prediction (ETOP) to stop objectness predictions at appropriate
layers in the decoder, resolving the learning conflicts between class and
objectness predictions in PROB. Additionally, we introduce Task-Decoupled Query
Initialization (TDQI), which efficiently extracts features of known and unknown
objects, thereby improving performance. TDQI is a query initialization method
that combines query selection and learnable queries, and it is a module that
can be easily integrated into existing DETR-based OWOD models. Extensive
experiments on OWOD benchmarks demonstrate that Decoupled PROB surpasses all
existing methods across several metrics, significantly improving performance.

Result: 在LIDC-IDRI和NPC-170数据集上，DiffOSeg优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DiffOSeg能够同时实现共识和偏好驱动的分割，表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Annotation variability remains a substantial challenge in medical image
segmentation, stemming from ambiguous imaging boundaries and diverse clinical
expertise. Traditional deep learning methods producing single deterministic
segmentation predictions often fail to capture these annotator biases. Although
recent studies have explored multi-rater segmentation, existing methods
typically focus on a single perspective -- either generating a probabilistic
``gold standard'' consensus or preserving expert-specific preferences -- thus
struggling to provide a more omni view. In this study, we propose DiffOSeg, a
two-stage diffusion-based framework, which aims to simultaneously achieve both
consensus-driven (combining all experts' opinions) and preference-driven
(reflecting experts' individual assessments) segmentation. Stage I establishes
population consensus through a probabilistic consensus strategy, while Stage II
captures expert-specific preference via adaptive prompts. Demonstrated on two
public datasets (LIDC-IDRI and NPC-170), our model outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated metrics. Source code is available

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, show impressive zero-shot
recognition ability and can be easily transferred to specific downstream tasks
via prompt tuning, even with limited training data. However, existing prompt
tuning methods face two main challenges: (1) In few-shot scenarios, data
scarcity often leads to overfitting, making the model sensitive to changes in
the input domain. (2) To mitigate overfitting, these methods typically rely on
complex task-specific model architectures and sensitive hyperparameter tuning,
severely restricting their general applicability. To address these issues, we
propose a simpler and more general framework called GLAD (Generalizable LoRA
tuning with RegulArized GraDient). We show that merely applying LoRA achieves
performance in downstream tasks comparable to current state-of-the-art
prompt-based methods. While LoRA is effective and easy to use, it remains
susceptible to overfitting in few-shot learning scenarios. To mitigate this
risk, we introduce a gradient-based regularization technique. This technique
effectively steers the optimization trajectory, encouraging the model to find a
more stable parameter region that is robust to variations in data distribution.
Through extensive experiments conducted on 15 benchmark datasets, we
demonstrate that GLAD outperforms previous tuning approaches in terms of
base-to-novel class generalization, image domain generalization, and
cross-dataset generalization. The code will be publicly available.

Abstract: Fetal lung maturity is a critical indicator for predicting neonatal outcomes
and the need for post-natal intervention, especially for pregnancies affected
by fetal growth restriction. Intra-voxel incoherent motion analysis has shown
promising results for non-invasive assessment of fetal lung development, but
its reliance on manual segmentation is time-consuming, thus limiting its
clinical applicability. In this work, we present an automated lung maturity
evaluation pipeline for diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images that
consists of a deep learning-based fetal lung segmentation model and a
model-fitting lung maturity assessment. A 3D nnU-Net model was trained on
manually segmented images selected from the baseline frames of 4D
diffusion-weighted MRI scans. The segmentation model demonstrated robust
performance, yielding a mean Dice coefficient of 82.14%. Next, voxel-wise model
fitting was performed based on both the nnU-Net-predicted and manual lung
segmentations to quantify IVIM parameters reflecting tissue microstructure and
perfusion. The results suggested no differences between the two. Our work shows
that a fully automated pipeline is possible for supporting fetal lung maturity
assessment and clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Enabling large-scale generative models to continuously learn new visual
concepts is essential for personalizing pre-trained models to meet individual
user preferences. Existing approaches for continual visual concept learning are
constrained by two fundamental challenges: catastrophic forgetting and
parameter expansion. In this paper, we propose Redundancy-Removal Mixture of
Experts (R^2MoE), a parameter-efficient framework for lifelong visual concept
learning that effectively learns new concepts while incurring minimal parameter
overhead. Our framework includes three key innovative contributions: First, we
propose a mixture-of-experts framework with a routing distillation mechanism
that enables experts to acquire concept-specific knowledge while preserving the
gating network's routing capability, thereby effectively mitigating
catastrophic forgetting. Second, we propose a strategy for eliminating
redundant layer-wise experts that reduces the number of expert parameters by
fully utilizing previously learned experts. Third, we employ a hierarchical
local attention-guided inference approach to mitigate interference between
generated visual concepts. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our
method generates images with superior conceptual fidelity compared to the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, achieving an impressive 87.8\% reduction in
forgetting rates and 63.3\% fewer parameters on the CustomConcept 101 dataset.

Abstract: High-resolution 3D point clouds are highly effective for detecting subtle
structural anomalies in industrial inspection. However, their dense and
irregular nature imposes significant challenges, including high computational
cost, sensitivity to spatial misalignment, and difficulty in capturing
localized structural differences. This paper introduces a registration-based
anomaly detection framework that combines multi-prototype alignment with
cluster-wise discrepancy analysis to enable precise 3D anomaly localization.
Specifically, each test sample is first registered to multiple normal
prototypes to enable direct structural comparison. To evaluate anomalies at a
local level, clustering is performed over the point cloud, and similarity is
computed between features from the test sample and the prototypes within each
cluster. Rather than selecting cluster centroids randomly, a keypoint-guided
strategy is employed, where geometrically informative points are chosen as
centroids. This ensures that clusters are centered on feature-rich regions,
enabling more meaningful and stable distance-based comparisons. Extensive
experiments on the Real3D-AD benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in both object-level and point-level
anomaly detection, even using only raw features.

blurry backgrounds and is essential for various applications. The detection
task is challenging due to the small size of the targets and their sparse
distribution in infrared small target datasets. Although existing IRSTD methods
and datasets have led to significant advancements, they are limited by their
reliance solely on the image modality. Recent advances in deep learning and
large vision-language models have shown remarkable performance in various
visual recognition tasks. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal IRSTD
framework that incorporates language priors to guide small target detection. We
leverage language-guided attention weights derived from the language prior to
enhance the model's ability for IRSTD, presenting a novel approach that
combines textual information with image data to improve IRSTD capabilities.
Utilizing the state-of-the-art GPT-4 vision model, we generate text
descriptions that provide the locations of small targets in infrared images,
employing careful prompt engineering to ensure improved accuracy. Due to the
absence of multimodal IR datasets, existing IRSTD methods rely solely on image
data. To address this shortcoming, we have curated a multimodal infrared
dataset that includes both image and text modalities for small target
detection, expanding upon the popular IRSTD-1k and NUDT-SIRST datasets. We
validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments and
comprehensive ablation studies. The results demonstrate significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art method, with relative percentage
differences of 9.74%, 13.02%, 1.25%, and 67.87% in IoU, nIoU, Pd, and Fa on the
NUAA-SIRST subset, and 4.41%, 2.04%, 2.01%, and 113.43% on the IRSTD-1k subset
of the LangIR dataset, respectively.

TL;DR: RS-TinyNet是一种针对遥感图像中小目标检测的多阶段特征融合与增强模型，通过新颖的设计显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像中的小目标检测因空间信息有限、特征表示弱和背景复杂而具有挑战性，现有检测器表现不佳。

Method: 提出RS-TinyNet，包含小目标显著性建模和特征完整性重建两大设计，并引入三个逐步特征增强模块（MDCA、ARB、PFDH）。

Result: 在AI-TOD数据集上AP提升4.0%，AP75提升6.5%，DIOR数据集进一步验证其优越性。

Conclusion: 多阶段特征融合策略为复杂遥感环境中的小目标检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting tiny objects in remote sensing (RS) imagery has been a
long-standing challenge due to their extremely limited spatial information,
weak feature representations, and dense distributions across complex
backgrounds. Despite numerous efforts devoted, mainstream detectors still
underperform in such scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce RS-TinyNet, a
multi-stage feature fusion and enhancement model explicitly tailored for RS
tiny object detection in various RS scenarios. RS-TinyNet comes with two novel
designs: tiny object saliency modeling and feature integrity reconstruction.
Guided by these principles, we design three step-wise feature enhancement
modules. Among them, the multi-dimensional collaborative attention (MDCA)
module employs multi-dimensional attention to enhance the saliency of tiny
objects. Additionally, the auxiliary reversible branch (ARB) and a progressive
fusion detection head (PFDH) module are introduced to preserve information flow
and fuse multi-level features to bridge semantic gaps and retain structural
detail. Comprehensive experiments on public RS dataset AI-TOD show that our
RS-TinyNet surpasses existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) detectors by 4.0% AP and
6.5% AP75. Evaluations on DIOR benchmark dataset further validate its superior
detection performance in diverse RS scenarios. These results demonstrate that
the proposed multi-stage feature fusion strategy offers an effective and
practical solution for tiny object detection in complex RS environments.

Method: 提出了一种针对DINOv2粗粒度特征的显著关键点检测器，结合几何特征增强局部化表示，并使用基于Transformer的匹配器和可微分姿态估计层。

Conclusion: DINO-VO展示了在复杂环境中的鲁棒性和泛化能力，性能接近视觉SLAM系统，适用于户外驾驶场景。

Abstract: Learning-based monocular visual odometry (VO) poses robustness,
generalization, and efficiency challenges in robotics. Recent advances in
visual foundation models, such as DINOv2, have improved robustness and
generalization in various vision tasks, yet their integration in VO remains
limited due to coarse feature granularity. In this paper, we present DINO-VO, a
feature-based VO system leveraging DINOv2 visual foundation model for its
sparse feature matching. To address the integration challenge, we propose a
salient keypoints detector tailored to DINOv2's coarse features. Furthermore,
we complement DINOv2's robust-semantic features with fine-grained geometric
features, resulting in more localizable representations. Finally, a
transformer-based matcher and differentiable pose estimation layer enable
precise camera motion estimation by learning good matches. Against prior
detector-descriptor networks like SuperPoint, DINO-VO demonstrates greater
robustness in challenging environments. Furthermore, we show superior accuracy
and generalization of the proposed feature descriptors against standalone
DINOv2 coarse features. DINO-VO outperforms prior frame-to-frame VO methods on
the TartanAir and KITTI datasets and is competitive on EuRoC dataset, while
running efficiently at 72 FPS with less than 1GB of memory usage on a single
GPU. Moreover, it performs competitively against Visual SLAM systems on outdoor
driving scenarios, showcasing its generalization capabilities.

Result: 在未见环境中导航成功率分别达到57%和35.2%，性能提升23.9%和15.0%。

Conclusion: SE-VLN展示了作为自进化框架的巨大潜力，性能随经验库增长而提升。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language navigation (VLN) were mainly attributed to
emerging large language models (LLMs). These methods exhibited excellent
generalization capabilities in instruction understanding and task reasoning.
However, they were constrained by the fixed knowledge bases and reasoning
abilities of LLMs, preventing fully incorporating experiential knowledge and
thus resulting in a lack of efficient evolutionary capacity. To address this,
we drew inspiration from the evolution capabilities of natural agents, and
proposed a self-evolving VLN framework (SE-VLN) to endow VLN agents with the
ability to continuously evolve during testing. To the best of our knowledge, it
was the first time that an multimodal LLM-powered self-evolving VLN framework
was proposed. Specifically, SE-VLN comprised three core modules, i.e., a
hierarchical memory module to transfer successful and failure cases into
reusable knowledge, a retrieval-augmented thought-based reasoning module to
retrieve experience and enable multi-step decision-making, and a reflection
module to realize continual evolution. Comprehensive tests illustrated that the
SE-VLN achieved navigation success rates of 57% and 35.2% in unseen
environments, representing absolute performance improvements of 23.9% and 15.0%
over current state-of-the-art methods on R2R and REVERSE datasets,
respectively. Moreover, the SE-VLN showed performance improvement with
increasing experience repository, elucidating its great potential as a
self-evolving agent framework for VLN.

Abstract: Existing world models for autonomous driving struggle with long-horizon
generation and generalization to challenging scenarios. In this work, we
develop a model using simple design choices, and without additional supervision
or sensors, such as maps, depth, or multiple cameras. We show that our model
yields state-of-the-art performance, despite having only 469M parameters and
being trained on 280h of video data. It particularly stands out in difficult
scenarios like turning maneuvers and urban traffic. We test whether discrete
token models possibly have advantages over continuous models based on flow
matching. To this end, we set up a hybrid tokenizer that is compatible with
both approaches and allows for a side-by-side comparison. Our study concludes
in favor of the continuous autoregressive model, which is less brittle on
individual design choices and more powerful than the model built on discrete
tokens. Code, models and qualitative results are publicly available at

Abstract: While recent advancements in deep neural networks (DNNs) have substantially
enhanced visual AI's capabilities, the challenge of inadequate data diversity

novel image synthesis methodology tailored for construction worker detection,
leveraging the generative-AI platform Midjourney. The approach entails
generating a collection of 12,000 synthetic images by formulating 3000
different prompts, with an emphasis on image realism and diversity. These
images, after manual labeling, serve as a dataset for DNN training. Evaluation
on a real construction image dataset yielded promising results, with the model
attaining average precisions (APs) of 0.937 and 0.642 at
intersection-over-union (IoU) thresholds of 0.5 and 0.5 to 0.95, respectively.
Notably, the model demonstrated near-perfect performance on the synthetic
dataset, achieving APs of 0.994 and 0.919 at the two mentioned thresholds.
These findings reveal both the potential and weakness of generative AI in

Abstract: Recent advances in Generative AI (GenAI) have led to significant improvements
in the quality of generated visual content. As AI-generated visual content
becomes increasingly indistinguishable from real content, the challenge of
detecting the generated content becomes critical in combating misinformation,
ensuring privacy, and preventing security threats. Although there has been
substantial progress in detecting AI-generated images, current methods for
video detection are largely focused on deepfakes, which primarily involve human
faces. However, the field of video generation has advanced beyond DeepFakes,
creating an urgent need for methods capable of detecting AI-generated videos
with generic content. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that
leverages pre-trained visual models to distinguish between real and generated
videos. The features extracted from these pre-trained models, which have been
trained on extensive real visual content, contain inherent signals that can
help distinguish real from generated videos. Using these extracted features, we
achieve high detection performance without requiring additional model training,
and we further improve performance by training a simple linear classification
layer on top of the extracted features. We validated our method on a dataset we
compiled (VID-AID), which includes around 10,000 AI-generated videos produced
by 9 different text-to-video models, along with 4,000 real videos, totaling
over 7 hours of video content. Our evaluation shows that our approach achieves
high detection accuracy, above 90% on average, underscoring its effectiveness.
Upon acceptance, we plan to publicly release the code, the pre-trained models,
and our dataset to support ongoing research in this critical area.

Motivation: 研究动机是开发一种无需数据集特定微调即可适应不同分辨率和视差范围的通用立体匹配模型，同时解决局部搜索方法在全局一致性上的局限性以及全局匹配架构的计算成本问题。

Method: 方法包括设计一个多分辨率变换器用于长距离对应，结合一种新的损失函数来集中概率于可行匹配，从而实现视差、遮挡和置信度的联合估计。

Result: $S^2M^2$在Middlebury v3和ETH3D基准测试中取得了最优性能，显著优于现有方法，并在效率和细节重建上表现出色。

Conclusion: 结论是$S^2M^2$通过创新的架构和训练方法，成功解决了立体匹配中的关键挑战，为未来的研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: The pursuit of a generalizable stereo matching model, capable of performing
across varying resolutions and disparity ranges without dataset-specific
fine-tuning, has revealed a fundamental trade-off. Iterative local search
methods achieve high scores on constrained benchmarks, but their core mechanism
inherently limits the global consistency required for true generalization. On
the other hand, global matching architectures, while theoretically more robust,
have been historically rendered infeasible by prohibitive computational and
memory costs. We resolve this dilemma with $S^2M^2$: a global matching
architecture that achieves both state-of-the-art accuracy and high efficiency
without relying on cost volume filtering or deep refinement stacks. Our design
integrates a multi-resolution transformer for robust long-range correspondence,
trained with a novel loss function that concentrates probability on feasible
matches. This approach enables a more robust joint estimation of disparity,
occlusion, and confidence. $S^2M^2$ establishes a new state of the art on the
Middlebury v3 and ETH3D benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior methods
across most metrics while reconstructing high-quality details with competitive
efficiency.

Motivation: 传统流匹配和扩散策略需要额外的条件机制（如交叉注意力）来生成动作，增加了时间和空间开销。VITA旨在消除这些模块，同时保留生成建模能力。

Method: VITA将潜在图像作为流源，通过自动编码器创建结构化的动作潜在空间，并通过流潜在解码监督流匹配，实现端到端学习。

Result: 在ALOHA平台的双臂操作任务中，VITA性能优于或匹配现有生成策略，并将推理延迟降低了50-130%。

Conclusion: VITA是首个仅用MLP层就能解决复杂双臂操作任务的流匹配策略，展示了其高效性和简单性。

Abstract: We present VITA, a Vision-To-Action flow matching policy that evolves latent
visual representations into latent actions for visuomotor control. Traditional
flow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions
(e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like
cross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating
time and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent
images as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action
while eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative
modeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different
modalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data
lacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional
visual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a
structured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,
up-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we
supervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs
through flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss
through sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end
learning. Implemented as simple MLP layers, VITA is evaluated on challenging
bi-manual manipulation tasks on the ALOHA platform, including 5 simulation and
2 real-world tasks. Despite its simplicity, MLP-only VITA outperforms or
matches state-of-the-art generative policies while reducing inference latency
by 50-130% compared to conventional flow matching policies requiring different
conditioning mechanisms or complex architectures. To our knowledge, VITA is the
first MLP-only flow matching policy capable of solving complex bi-manual
manipulation tasks like those in ALOHA benchmarks.

Result: 实验表明，AOFT在多个下游图像分类任务中表现优异，验证了其泛化能力的提升。

Conclusion: AOFT通过近似正交性改进低秩适应矩阵，显著提升了视觉变换器的泛化能力。

Abstract: A prevalent approach in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of pre-trained
Vision Transformers (ViT) involves freezing the majority of the backbone
parameters and solely learning low-rank adaptation weight matrices to
accommodate downstream tasks. These low-rank matrices are commonly derived
through the multiplication structure of down-projection and up-projection
matrices, exemplified by methods such as LoRA and Adapter. In this work, we
observe an approximate orthogonality among any two row or column vectors within
any weight matrix of the backbone parameters; however, this property is absent
in the vectors of the down/up-projection matrices. Approximate orthogonality
implies a reduction in the upper bound of the model's generalization error,
signifying that the model possesses enhanced generalization capability. If the
fine-tuned down/up-projection matrices were to exhibit this same property as
the pre-trained backbone matrices, could the generalization capability of
fine-tuned ViTs be further augmented? To address this question, we propose an
Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (AOFT) strategy for representing the
low-rank weight matrices. This strategy employs a single learnable vector to
generate a set of approximately orthogonal vectors, which form the
down/up-projection matrices, thereby aligning the properties of these matrices
with those of the backbone. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves competitive performance across a range of downstream image
classification tasks, confirming the efficacy of the enhanced generalization
capability embedded in the down/up-projection matrices.

Conclusion: DiffClean是一种有效的防御化妆攻击的方法，提升了年龄验证和面部识别的性能。

Abstract: Accurate age verification can protect underage users from unauthorized access
to online platforms and e-commerce sites that provide age-restricted services.
However, accurate age estimation can be confounded by several factors,
including facial makeup that can induce changes to alter perceived identity and
age to fool both humans and machines. In this work, we propose DiffClean which
erases makeup traces using a text-guided diffusion model to defend against
makeup attacks. DiffClean improves age estimation (minor vs. adult accuracy by
4.8%) and face verification (TMR by 8.9% at FMR=0.01%) over competing baselines

Abstract: Realistic and controllable garment visualization is critical for fashion

introduce FashionPose, the first unified text-to-pose-to-relighting generation
framework. Given a natural language description, our method first predicts a 2D
human pose, then employs a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity person

same textual input. By replacing explicit pose annotations with text-driven

Abstract: The reasoning-based pose estimation (RPE) benchmark has emerged as a widely
adopted evaluation standard for pose-aware multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Despite its significance, we identified critical reproducibility and
benchmark-quality issues that hinder fair and consistent quantitative
evaluations. Most notably, the benchmark utilizes different image indices from
those of the original 3DPW dataset, forcing researchers into tedious and
error-prone manual matching processes to obtain accurate ground-truth (GT)
annotations for quantitative metrics (\eg, MPJPE, PA-MPJPE). Furthermore, our
analysis reveals several inherent benchmark-quality limitations, including
significant image redundancy, scenario imbalance, overly simplistic poses, and
ambiguous textual descriptions, collectively undermining reliable evaluations
across diverse scenarios. To alleviate manual effort and enhance
reproducibility, we carefully refined the GT annotations through meticulous
visual matching and publicly release these refined annotations as an
open-source resource, thereby promoting consistent quantitative evaluations and
facilitating future advancements in human pose-aware multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Hand-object interaction detection remains an open challenge in real-time
applications, where intuitive user experiences depend on fast and accurate
detection of interactions with surrounding objects. We propose an efficient
approach for detecting hand-objects interactions from streaming egocentric
vision that operates in real time. Our approach consists of an action
recognition module and an object detection module for identifying active
objects upon confirmed interaction. Our Mamba model with EfficientNetV2 as
backbone for action recognition achieves 38.52% p-AP on the ENIGMA-51 benchmark
at 30fps, while our fine-tuned YOLOWorld reaches 85.13% AP for hand and object.
We implement our models in a cascaded architecture where the action recognition
and object detection modules operate sequentially. When the action recognition
predicts a contact state, it activates the object detection module, which in
turn performs inference on the relevant frame to detect and classify the active
object.

Conclusion: 证明了在移动设备上实现实时高质量视频生成的可行性。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have shown strong performance in video
generation tasks, but their high computational cost makes them impractical for
resource-constrained devices like smartphones, and real-time generation is even
more challenging. In this work, we propose a series of novel optimizations to
significantly accelerate video generation and enable real-time performance on
mobile platforms. First, we employ a highly compressed variational autoencoder
(VAE) to reduce the dimensionality of the input data without sacrificing visual
quality. Second, we introduce a KD-guided, sensitivity-aware tri-level pruning
strategy to shrink the model size to suit mobile platform while preserving
critical performance characteristics. Third, we develop an adversarial step
distillation technique tailored for DiT, which allows us to reduce the number
of inference steps to four. Combined, these optimizations enable our model to

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of high-fidelity view synthesis of humans
with sparse-view videos as input. Previous methods solve the issue of
insufficient observation by leveraging 4D diffusion models to generate videos
at novel viewpoints. However, the generated videos from these models often lack
spatio-temporal consistency, thus degrading view synthesis quality. In this
paper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the
spatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define
a latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human
pose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoising the
latent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and
finally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised
latents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across
the latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field
and thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory
consumption affordable. The experiments on the DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ
datasets demonstrate that our method is able to synthesize high-quality and
consistent novel-view videos and significantly outperforms the existing
approaches. See our project page for interactive demos and video results:

Abstract: In visual generation tasks, the responses and combinations of complex
concepts often lack stability and are error-prone, which remains an
under-explored area. In this paper, we attempt to explore the causal factors
for poor concept responses through elaborately designed experiments. We also
design a concept-wise equalization loss function (IMBA loss) to address this
issue. Our proposed method is online, eliminating the need for offline dataset
processing, and requires minimal code changes. In our newly proposed complex
concept benchmark Inert-CompBench and two other public test sets, our method
significantly enhances the concept response capability of baseline models and
yields highly competitive results with only a few codes.

Conclusion: AutoPartGen展示了在3D部件生成中的高效性和灵活性，为组合式3D生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce AutoPartGen, a model that generates objects composed of 3D parts
in an autoregressive manner. This model can take as input an image of an
object, 2D masks of the object's parts, or an existing 3D object, and generate
a corresponding compositional 3D reconstruction. Our approach builds upon
3DShape2VecSet, a recent latent 3D representation with powerful geometric
expressiveness. We observe that this latent space exhibits strong compositional
properties, making it particularly well-suited for part-based generation tasks.
Specifically, AutoPartGen generates object parts autoregressively, predicting
one part at a time while conditioning on previously generated parts and
additional inputs, such as 2D images, masks, or 3D objects. This process
continues until the model decides that all parts have been generated, thus
determining automatically the type and number of parts. The resulting parts can
be seamlessly assembled into coherent objects or scenes without requiring
additional optimization. We evaluate both the overall 3D generation
capabilities and the part-level generation quality of AutoPartGen,
demonstrating that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D part
generation.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce $\pi^3$, a feed-forward neural network that offers a novel
approach to visual geometry reconstruction, breaking the reliance on a
conventional fixed reference view. Previous methods often anchor their
reconstructions to a designated viewpoint, an inductive bias that can lead to
instability and failures if the reference is suboptimal. In contrast, $\pi^3$
employs a fully permutation-equivariant architecture to predict
affine-invariant camera poses and scale-invariant local point maps without any
reference frames. This design makes our model inherently robust to input
ordering and highly scalable. These advantages enable our simple and bias-free
approach to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks,
including camera pose estimation, monocular/video depth estimation, and dense
point map reconstruction. Code and models are publicly available.

Abstract: Flow matching has emerged as a compelling generative modeling approach that
is widely used across domains. To generate data via a flow matching model, an
ordinary differential equation (ODE) is numerically solved via forward
integration of the modeled velocity field. To better capture the multi-modality
that is inherent in typical velocity fields, hierarchical flow matching was
recently introduced. It uses a hierarchy of ODEs that are numerically
integrated when generating data. This hierarchy of ODEs captures the
multi-modal velocity distribution just like vanilla flow matching is capable of
modeling a multi-modal data distribution. While this hierarchy enables to model
multi-modal velocity distributions, the complexity of the modeled distribution
remains identical across levels of the hierarchy. In this paper, we study how
to gradually adjust the complexity of the distributions across different levels
of the hierarchy via mini-batch couplings. We show the benefits of mini-batch
couplings in hierarchical rectified flow matching via compelling results on
synthetic and imaging data. Code is available at

Result: 构建了VideoITG-40K数据集，并在多模态视频理解基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: VideoITG展示了视频理解的潜力，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that selecting informative and relevant video
frames can significantly improve the performance of Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs). Current methods, such as reducing inter-frame redundancy,
employing separate models for image-text relevance assessment, or utilizing
temporal video grounding for event localization, substantially adopt
unsupervised learning paradigms, whereas they struggle to address the complex
scenarios in long video understanding. We propose Instructed Temporal Grounding
for Videos (VideoITG), featuring customized frame sampling aligned with user
instructions. The core of VideoITG is the VidThinker pipeline, an automated
annotation framework that explicitly mimics the human annotation process.
First, it generates detailed clip-level captions conditioned on the
instruction; then, it retrieves relevant video segments through
instruction-guided reasoning; finally, it performs fine-grained frame selection
to pinpoint the most informative visual evidence. Leveraging VidThinker, we
construct the VideoITG-40K dataset, containing 40K videos and 500K instructed
temporal grounding annotations. We then design a plug-and-play VideoITG model,
which takes advantage of visual language alignment and reasoning capabilities
of Video-LLMs, for effective frame selection in a discriminative manner.
Coupled with Video-LLMs, VideoITG achieves consistent performance improvements
across multiple multimodal video understanding benchmarks, showing its
superiority and great potentials for video understanding.
