### [1] [Structured Information Matters: Explainable ICD Coding with Patient-Level Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09699)
*Mingyang Li,Viktor Schlegel,Tingting Mu,Warren Del-Pinto,Goran Nenadic*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用知识图谱结构化表示临床文档，用于自动化ICD编码任务，在减少文本量的同时保留关键信息，显著提升了编码性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床文档到标准化词汇的映射对临床研究和患者护理至关重要，但手动编码耗时且难以规模化。现有方法主要关注输出编码表示，而输入文档的外部知识表示研究不足。

Method: 构建文档级知识图谱来结构化表示输入文档，提供患者状况的全面结构化视图。将这种图谱表示集成到最先进的PLM-ICD架构中进行ICD-9自动编码。

Result: 知识图谱仅用原文23%的文本量就保留了90%的信息。在ICD编码任务中，Macro-F1分数提升了最高3.20%，同时提高了训练效率。

Conclusion: 基于知识图谱的结构化文档表示能有效提升自动ICD编码性能，改善模型可解释性，为临床文档处理提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Mapping clinical documents to standardised clinical vocabularies is an
important task, as it provides structured data for information retrieval and
analysis, which is essential to clinical research, hospital administration and
improving patient care. However, manual coding is both difficult and
time-consuming, making it impractical at scale. Automated coding can
potentially alleviate this burden, improving the availability and accuracy of
structured clinical data. The task is difficult to automate, as it requires
mapping to high-dimensional and long-tailed target spaces, such as the
International Classification of Diseases (ICD). While external knowledge
sources have been readily utilised to enhance output code representation, the
use of external resources for representing the input documents has been
underexplored. In this work, we compute a structured representation of the
input documents, making use of document-level knowledge graphs (KGs) that
provide a comprehensive structured view of a patient's condition. The resulting
knowledge graph efficiently represents the patient-centred input documents with
23\% of the original text while retaining 90\% of the information. We assess
the effectiveness of this graph for automated ICD-9 coding by integrating it
into the state-of-the-art ICD coding architecture PLM-ICD. Our experiments
yield improved Macro-F1 scores by up to 3.20\% on popular benchmarks, while
improving training efficiency. We attribute this improvement to different types
of entities and relationships in the KG, and demonstrate the improved
explainability potential of the approach over the text-only baseline.

### [2] [Cross-Layer Attention Probing for Fine-Grained Hallucination Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09700)
*Malavika Suresh,Rahaf Aljundi,Ikechukwu Nkisi-Orji,Nirmalie Wiratunga*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出CLAP方法，通过跨层注意力探测技术检测LLM幻觉，在多个模型和任务上优于基线，支持细粒度检测和检测后缓解策略


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型广泛应用，其生成不准确文本（幻觉）的可靠性问题日益突出，需要有效的检测方法

Method: Cross-Layer Attention Probing (CLAP)技术，将LLM整个残差流的激活作为联合序列处理，进行幻觉检测

Result: 在5个LLM和3个任务上的实验表明，CLAP在贪婪解码和高温度采样响应中都优于基线检测方法，支持细粒度检测

Conclusion: CLAP方法能够有效检测幻觉，支持检测后缓解策略提高LLM可靠性，且在分布外场景下仍保持高可靠性

Abstract: With the large-scale adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various
applications, there is a growing reliability concern due to their tendency to
generate inaccurate text, i.e. hallucinations. In this work, we propose
Cross-Layer Attention Probing (CLAP), a novel activation probing technique for
hallucination detection, which processes the LLM activations across the entire
residual stream as a joint sequence. Our empirical evaluations using five LLMs
and three tasks show that CLAP improves hallucination detection compared to
baselines on both greedy decoded responses as well as responses sampled at
higher temperatures, thus enabling fine-grained detection, i.e. the ability to
disambiguate hallucinations and non-hallucinations among different sampled
responses to a given prompt. This allows us to propose a detect-then-mitigate
strategy using CLAP to reduce hallucinations and improve LLM reliability
compared to direct mitigation approaches. Finally, we show that CLAP maintains
high reliability even when applied out-of-distribution.

### [3] [Optimal Multi-Task Learning at Regularization Horizon for Speech Translation Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09701)
*JungHo Jung,Junhyun Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文从正则化角度研究多任务学习，探索跨模态一致性正则化和同模态R-drop正则化，提出正则化地平线概念，在MuST-C数据集上取得接近SOTA的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端语音到文本翻译面临配对数据稀缺问题，需要利用机器翻译的双语数据通过多任务学习来克服这一不足

Method: 从正则化视角构建多任务学习框架，研究跨模态一致性正则化和同模态R-drop正则化，分析MT损失系数作为正则化源的作用，提出正则化地平线概念

Result: 实验表明，在正则化地平线内调优超参数可以在MuST-C数据集上达到接近最先进的性能

Conclusion: 通过整合三种正则化源（跨模态一致性、同模态R-drop和MT损失系数），可以构建有效的正则化地平线，显著提升语音到文本翻译性能

Abstract: End-to-end speech-to-text translation typically suffers from the scarcity of
paired speech-text data. One way to overcome this shortcoming is to utilize the
bitext data from the Machine Translation (MT) task and perform Multi-Task
Learning (MTL). In this paper, we formulate MTL from a regularization
perspective and explore how sequences can be regularized within and across
modalities. By thoroughly investigating the effect of consistency
regularization (different modality) and R-drop (same modality), we show how
they respectively contribute to the total regularization. We also demonstrate
that the coefficient of MT loss serves as another source of regularization in
the MTL setting. With these three sources of regularization, we introduce the
optimal regularization contour in the high-dimensional space, called the
regularization horizon. Experiments show that tuning the hyperparameters within
the regularization horizon achieves near state-of-the-art performance on the
MuST-C dataset.

### [4] [Creativity Benchmark: A benchmark for marketing creativity for LLM models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09702)
*Ninad Bhat,Kieran Browne,Pip Bingemann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Creativity Benchmark是一个评估大语言模型在营销创意领域的框架，包含100个品牌和3种提示类型。人类专家评估显示模型表现差异不大（最高模型仅比最低模型胜率61%），自动评估与人工评估相关性弱，需要专家人工评估和多样性感知的工作流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型评估方法在营销创意领域缺乏专业性和可靠性，需要建立专门的评估框架来测试模型在品牌约束创意任务中的表现，并验证自动评估方法是否能替代人类专家评估。

Method: 构建包含100个品牌（12个类别）和3种提示类型（洞察、想法、疯狂想法）的基准测试，收集678名专业创意人员的11,012对匿名比较数据，使用Bradley-Terry模型分析，同时计算余弦距离来评估模型多样性和对提示重构的敏感性。

Result: 模型表现紧密聚集，没有模型在所有品牌或提示类型中占主导地位（最高-最低差异Δθ≈0.45，对应61%的胜率）；三种LLM作为评判者的设置与人类排名相关性弱且不一致；传统创造力测试仅部分适用于品牌约束任务。

Conclusion: 自动化评判无法替代人类评估，需要专家人工评估和考虑多样性的工作流程，强调了在营销创意领域专业人类评估的重要性。

Abstract: We introduce Creativity Benchmark, an evaluation framework for large language
models (LLMs) in marketing creativity. The benchmark covers 100 brands (12
categories) and three prompt types (Insights, Ideas, Wild Ideas). Human
pairwise preferences from 678 practising creatives over 11,012 anonymised
comparisons, analysed with Bradley-Terry models, show tightly clustered
performance with no model dominating across brands or prompt types: the
top-bottom spread is $\Delta\theta \approx 0.45$, which implies a head-to-head
win probability of $0.61$; the highest-rated model beats the lowest only about
$61\%$ of the time. We also analyse model diversity using cosine distances to
capture intra- and inter-model variation and sensitivity to prompt reframing.
Comparing three LLM-as-judge setups with human rankings reveals weak,
inconsistent correlations and judge-specific biases, underscoring that
automated judges cannot substitute for human evaluation. Conventional
creativity tests also transfer only partially to brand-constrained tasks.
Overall, the results highlight the need for expert human evaluation and
diversity-aware workflows.

### [5] [CTCC: A Robust and Stealthy Fingerprinting Framework for Large Language Models via Cross-Turn Contextual Correlation Backdoor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09703)
*Zhenhua Xu,Xixiang Zhao,Xubin Yue,Shengwei Tian,Changting Lin,Meng Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CTCC是一种新颖的基于规则的语言模型指纹框架，通过多轮对话的上下文关联来嵌入所有权验证痕迹，解决了现有方法在隐蔽性、鲁棒性和泛化性方面的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型广泛部署引发了知识产权保护担忧，现有指纹方法在隐蔽性、鲁棒性和泛化性方面存在固有权衡，容易被检测或攻击。

Method: 提出CTCC框架，基于规则驱动，编码多轮对话中的上下文关联（如反事实关系），而非依赖词级或单轮触发，支持黑盒访问下的指纹验证。

Result: 在多个LLM架构上的广泛实验表明，CTCC相比先前工作 consistently 实现了更强的隐蔽性和鲁棒性，有效减少误报和指纹泄露。

Conclusion: CTCC为现实世界LLM部署场景中的所有权验证提供了可靠实用的解决方案，支持在部分触发暴露情况下的持续构建。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) has intensified
concerns around intellectual property (IP) protection, as model theft and
unauthorized redistribution become increasingly feasible. To address this,
model fingerprinting aims to embed verifiable ownership traces into LLMs.
However, existing methods face inherent trade-offs between stealthness,
robustness, and generalizability, being either detectable via distributional
shifts, vulnerable to adversarial modifications, or easily invalidated once the
fingerprint is revealed. In this work, we introduce CTCC, a novel rule-driven
fingerprinting framework that encodes contextual correlations across multiple
dialogue turns, such as counterfactual, rather than relying on token-level or
single-turn triggers. CTCC enables fingerprint verification under black-box
access while mitigating false positives and fingerprint leakage, supporting
continuous construction under a shared semantic rule even if partial triggers
are exposed. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures
demonstrate that CTCC consistently achieves stronger stealth and robustness
than prior work. Our findings position CTCC as a reliable and practical
solution for ownership verification in real-world LLM deployment scenarios. Our
code and data are publicly available at <https://github.com/Xuzhenhua55/CTCC>.

*Ali Mazyaki,Mohammad Naghizadeh,Samaneh Ranjkhah Zonouzaghi,Hossein Setareh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 语言模型在时间偏好选择中显现出未来定向性，并可通过提示词系统操控。推理模型更倾向选择延迟奖励，但个性化适应性有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型在时间偏好选择中的表现，以及是否可以系统地操控其时间定向偏好，为AI助手对齐异质性长期目标提供设计指南。

Method: 采用适配的人类实验协议，在时间交换任务中评估多个LM，并与人类决策者进行对比。引入操控性时间定向(MTO)指标，度量模型在未来定向和现在定向提示下的时间偏好变化。

Result: 推理聚焦模型(如DeepSeek-Reasoner和grok-3-mini)在未来定向提示下更多选择延迟奖励，但在身份或地理上的个性化适应性有限。能正确推理时间定向的模型会内化一种作为AI决策者的未来定向。

Conclusion: 研究为AI助手的设计提供了含义，应与异质性长期目标对齐。提出了个性化上下文检测和社会意识部署的研究议程。

Abstract: We study whether language models (LMs) exhibit future- versus
present-oriented preferences in intertemporal choice and whether those
preferences can be systematically manipulated. Using adapted human experimental
protocols, we evaluate multiple LMs on time-tradeoff tasks and benchmark them
against a sample of human decision makers. We introduce an operational metric,
the Manipulability of Time Orientation (MTO), defined as the change in an LM's
revealed time preference between future- and present-oriented prompts. In our
tests, reasoning-focused models (e.g., DeepSeek-Reasoner and grok-3-mini)
choose later options under future-oriented prompts but only partially
personalize decisions across identities or geographies. Moreover, models that
correctly reason about time orientation internalize a future orientation for
themselves as AI decision makers. We discuss design implications for AI
assistants that should align with heterogeneous, long-horizon goals and outline
a research agenda on personalized contextual calibration and socially aware
deployment.

### [7] [The Non-Determinism of Small LLMs: Evidence of Low Answer Consistency in Repetition Trials of Standard Multiple-Choice Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09705)
*Claudio Pinhanez,Paulo Cavalin,Cassia Sanctos,Marcelo Grave,Yago Primerano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了小型LLMs（2B-8B参数）在重复回答相同问题时的稳定性，分析了不同温度设置、模型大小、微调等因素对答案一致性的影响，并提出了新的分析工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究小型LLMs在多次回答相同问题时的稳定性，了解不同参数设置对答案一致性的影响，为模型选择提供指导。

Method: 使用开源LLMs对MMLU-Redux和MedQA基准测试中的问题进行10次重复回答，分析不同推理温度、模型大小（2B-8B vs 50B-80B）、微调模型与基础模型等因素的影响。

Result: 小型模型在低温设置下，能够一致回答的问题比例通常在50%-80%之间，一致答案的准确性与总体准确性有合理相关性。中型模型显示出更高的答案一致性水平。

Conclusion: 模型大小和推理温度对答案一致性有显著影响，中型模型比小型模型表现更好，一致答案的准确性可以作为模型整体性能的可靠指标。

Abstract: This work explores the consistency of small LLMs (2B-8B parameters) in
answering multiple times the same question. We present a study on known,
open-source LLMs responding to 10 repetitions of questions from the
multiple-choice benchmarks MMLU-Redux and MedQA, considering different
inference temperatures, small vs. medium models (50B-80B), finetuned vs. base
models, and other parameters. We also look into the effects of requiring
multi-trial answer consistency on accuracy and the trade-offs involved in
deciding which model best provides both of them. To support those studies, we
propose some new analytical and graphical tools. Results show that the number
of questions which can be answered consistently vary considerably among models
but are typically in the 50%-80% range for small models at low inference
temperatures. Also, accuracy among consistent answers seems to reasonably
correlate with overall accuracy. Results for medium-sized models seem to
indicate much higher levels of answer consistency.

*Nirmalendu Prakash,Yeo Wei Jie,Amir Abdullah,Ranjan Satapathy,Erik Cambria,Roy Ka Wei Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过稀疏自编码器分析LLM拒绝有害提示的内部机制，发现关键特征集并实现越狱，揭示安全行为的冗余性和可干预性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解指令调优大语言模型拒绝有害提示的内部因果机制，目前对此行为的内部原因了解不足

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器分析残差流激活，通过三阶段搜索流程（拒绝方向识别、贪婪过滤、交互发现）寻找关键特征集

Result: 成功找到能够翻转模型从拒绝到顺从的关键特征集，实现越狱，并发现冗余特征的存在

Conclusion: 该方法为精细审计和针对性干预安全行为提供了可能，通过可解释的潜在空间操作实现安全机制的理解和控制

Abstract: Refusal on harmful prompts is a key safety behaviour in instruction-tuned
large language models (LLMs), yet the internal causes of this behaviour remain
poorly understood. We study two public instruction-tuned models, Gemma-2-2B-IT
and LLaMA-3.1-8B-IT, using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) trained on
residual-stream activations. Given a harmful prompt, we search the SAE latent
space for feature sets whose ablation flips the model from refusal to
compliance, demonstrating causal influence and creating a jailbreak. Our search
proceeds in three stages: (1) Refusal Direction: find a refusal-mediating
direction and collect SAE features near that direction; (2) Greedy Filtering:
prune to a minimal set; and (3) Interaction Discovery: fit a factorization
machine (FM) that captures nonlinear interactions among the remaining active
features and the minimal set. This pipeline yields a broad set of
jailbreak-critical features, offering insight into the mechanistic basis of
refusal. Moreover, we find evidence of redundant features that remain dormant
unless earlier features are suppressed. Our findings highlight the potential
for fine-grained auditing and targeted intervention in safety behaviours by
manipulating the interpretable latent space.

### [9] [Assisting Research Proposal Writing with Large Language Models: Evaluation and Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09709)
*Jing Ren,Weiqi Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了两个对ChatGPT学术写作的评价指标（内容质量和参考文献有效性）以及基于这些指标的迭代提示方法，以解决大语言模型在学术写作中的评价和伪造参考文献等伪道弊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在学术写作中常出现错误或伪造的参考文献，引发伪道弊风险，而现有的内容质量评估主要依靠主观的人工判断，苦糙、主观且缺乏一致性。

Method: 提出两个关键评价指标：内容质量和参考文献有效性，并基于这些指标的得分设计了迭代提示方法。

Result: 实验结果显示，提出的指标为评估ChatGPT写作性能提供了客观的定量框架，而迭代提示方法显著提升了内容质量，同时减少了参考文献的不准确和伪造问题。

Conclusion: 该研究为解决大语言模型在学术语境中的关键伪道弊挑战提供了有效方法，通过定量评价和迭代提示显著提升了学术写作的质量和可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are increasingly used in academic
writing, yet issues such as incorrect or fabricated references raise ethical
concerns. Moreover, current content quality evaluations often rely on
subjective human judgment, which is labor-intensive and lacks objectivity,
potentially compromising the consistency and reliability. In this study, to
provide a quantitative evaluation and enhance research proposal writing
capabilities of LLMs, we propose two key evaluation metrics--content quality
and reference validity--and an iterative prompting method based on the scores
derived from these two metrics. Our extensive experiments show that the
proposed metrics provide an objective, quantitative framework for assessing
ChatGPT's writing performance. Additionally, iterative prompting significantly
enhances content quality while reducing reference inaccuracies and
fabrications, addressing critical ethical challenges in academic contexts.

### [10] [Generating Individual Travel Diaries Using Large Language Models Informed by Census and Land-Use Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09710)
*Sepehr Golrokh Amin,Devin Rhoads,Fatemeh Fakhrmoosavi,Nicholas E. Lownes,John N. Ivan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种使用大语言模型生成个体出行日记的新方法，通过开源数据生成人物画像并直接提示合成日记，验证显示与经典方法效果相当但在出行目的判断方面更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于大量专有家庭出行调查的方法成本高昂且数据获取困难，需要开发能够利用开源数据生成高质量出行日记的新方法。

Method: 使用美国社区调查和智能位置数据库的开源数据随机生成人物画像，通过直接提示大语言模型合成出行日记，并采用包含四个指标的综合真实性评分进行验证。

Result: LLM生成的日记整体真实性得分与经典方法相当（0.485 vs 0.455），在出行目的判断方面表现更优，且具有更好的一致性，同时在统计代表性方面优于经典方法（0.612 vs 0.435）。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在零样本条件下能够生成具有统计代表性的出行日记，为未来合成日记评估系统建立了可量化的真实性度量标准，证明了其在交通建模中的可行性。

Abstract: This study introduces a Large Language Model (LLM) scheme for generating
individual travel diaries in agent-based transportation models. While
traditional approaches rely on large quantities of proprietary household travel
surveys, the method presented in this study generates personas stochastically
from open-source American Community Survey (ACS) and Smart Location Database
(SLD) data, then synthesizes diaries through direct prompting. This study
features a novel one-to-cohort realism score: a composite of four metrics (Trip
Count Score, Interval Score, Purpose Score, and Mode Score) validated against
the Connecticut Statewide Transportation Study (CSTS) diaries, matched across
demographic variables. The validation utilizes Jensen-Shannon Divergence to
measure distributional similarities between generated and real diaries. When
compared to diaries generated with classical methods (Negative Binomial for
trip generation; Multinomial Logit for mode/purpose) calibrated on the
validation set, LLM-generated diaries achieve comparable overall realism (LLM
mean: 0.485 vs. 0.455). The LLM excels in determining trip purpose and
demonstrates greater consistency (narrower realism score distribution), while
classical models lead in numerical estimates of trip count and activity
duration. Aggregate validation confirms the LLM's statistical
representativeness (LLM mean: 0.612 vs. 0.435), demonstrating LLM's zero-shot
viability and establishing a quantifiable metric of diary realism for future
synthetic diary evaluation systems.

*Aya E. Fouda,Abdelrahamn A. Hassan,Radwa J. Hanafy,Mohammed E. Fouda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PsychiatryBench是一个基于权威精神病学教科书和案例集的专业基准测试，包含11个问答任务和5300多个专家标注项目，用于评估LLMs在精神病学应用中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估资源主要依赖小型临床访谈语料库、社交媒体帖子或合成对话，临床有效性有限，无法捕捉精神病学推理的复杂性，需要更专业的评估基准。

Method: 基于专家验证的精神病学教科书和案例集构建基准测试，包含诊断推理、治疗计划等11个任务类型，使用传统指标和LLM-as-judge相似性评分框架评估多种前沿LLM。

Result: 结果显示在临床一致性和安全性方面存在显著差距，特别是在多轮随访和管理任务中，表明需要专门的模型调优和更强大的评估范式。

Conclusion: PsychiatryBench为高风险心理健康应用中的LLM性能基准测试和改进提供了一个模块化、可扩展的平台。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold great promise in enhancing psychiatric
practice, from improving diagnostic accuracy to streamlining clinical
documentation and therapeutic support. However, existing evaluation resources
heavily rely on small clinical interview corpora, social media posts, or
synthetic dialogues, which limits their clinical validity and fails to capture
the full complexity of psychiatric reasoning. In this work, we introduce
PsychiatryBench, a rigorously curated benchmark grounded exclusively in
authoritative, expert-validated psychiatric textbooks and casebooks.
PsychiatryBench comprises eleven distinct question-answering tasks ranging from
diagnostic reasoning and treatment planning to longitudinal follow-up,
management planning, clinical approach, sequential case analysis, and
multiple-choice/extended matching formats totaling over 5,300 expert-annotated
items. We evaluate a diverse set of frontier LLMs (including Google Gemini,
DeepSeek, LLaMA 3, and QWQ-32) alongside leading open-source medical models
(e.g., OpenBiloLLM, MedGemma) using both conventional metrics and an
"LLM-as-judge" similarity scoring framework. Our results reveal substantial
gaps in clinical consistency and safety, particularly in multi-turn follow-up
and management tasks, underscoring the need for specialized model tuning and
more robust evaluation paradigms. PsychiatryBench offers a modular, extensible
platform for benchmarking and improving LLM performance in high-stakes mental
health applications.

### [12] [The Thinking Therapist: Training Large Language Models to Deliver Acceptance and Commitment Therapy using Supervised Fine-Tuning and Odds Ratio Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09712)
*Talha Tahir*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了两种训练方法(SFT和ORPO)和显式思维链(COT)对小型语言模型执行接纳与承诺疗法(ACT)的影响，发现ORPO方法在疗法保真度和沟通兼容性方面显著优于SFT和基础模型，COT只对SFT模型有显著改善作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过不同的训练方法和显式思维链来提升小型语言模型在接纳与承诺疗法中的性能，以支持精神健康领域的应用。

Method: 使用50组由Mistral-Large生成的合成ACT话语进行训练，采用监督微调(SFT)和比率改策优化(ORPO)两种方法，每种方法分别包含和不包含显式思维链(COT)步骤。通过模拟疗法会话进行评估，使用ACT保真度量表(ACT-FM)和治疗师兼容性量表(TES)进行量化分析。

Result: ORPO训练的模型在ACT保真度(χ²(5)=185.15, p<.001)和疗法兼容性(χ²(5)=140.37, p<.001)方面显著优于SFT和基础模型。COT只对SFT模型有显著改善作用，平均提高ACT-FM分数2.68分(p<.001)，对ORPO模型则没有显著影响。

Conclusion: 偏好对齐改策优化(ORPO)能够有效培养小型语言模型的ACT能力，关键在于学习疗法过程而非仅仅模仿内容；显式思维链的作用依赖于基础训练方法，只对仅依靠模仿训练的模型有显著帮助。

Abstract: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a third-wave cognitive behavioral
therapy with emerging evidence of efficacy in several psychiatric conditions.
This study investigates the impact of post-training methodology and explicit
reasoning on the ability of a small open-weight large language model (LLM) to
deliver ACT. Using 50 sets of synthetic ACT transcripts generated by
Mistral-Large, we trained Llama-3.2-3b-Instruct with two distinct approaches,
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and odds ratio policy optimization (ORPO), each
with and without an explicit chain-of-thought (COT) reasoning step. Performance
was evaluated by comparing these four post-trained variants against the base
Instruct model. These models were benchmarked in simulated therapy sessions,
with performance quantitatively assessed on the ACT Fidelity Measure (ACT-FM)
and the Therapist Empathy Scale (TES) by an LLM judge that had been fine-tuned
on human evaluations. Our findings demonstrate that the ORPO-trained models
significantly outperformed both their SFT and Instruct counterparts on ACT
fidelity ($\chi^2(5) = 185.15, p < .001$) and therapeutic empathy ($\chi^2(5) =
140.37, p < .001$). The effect of COT was conditional as it provided a
significant benefit to SFT models, improving ACT-FM scores by an average of
2.68 points ($p < .001$), while offering no discernible advantage to the
superior ORPO or instruct-tuned variants. We posit that the superiority of ORPO
stems from its ability to learn the therapeutic `process' over imitating
`content,' a key aspect of ACT, while COT acts as a necessary scaffold for
models trained only via imitation. This study establishes that
preference-aligned policy optimization can effectively instill ACT competencies
in small LLMs, and that the utility of explicit reasoning is highly dependent
on the underlying training paradigm.

TL;DR: HANRAG是一个基于启发式的RAG框架，通过查询路由、子查询分解和噪声过滤，有效解决多跳查询中的迭代检索浪费和噪声积累问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG方法在处理多跳查询时存在过度依赖迭代检索、检索内容噪声大等问题，需要更高效的框架来提升系统适应性和噪声抵抗能力。

Method: 提出HANRAG框架，使用强大的revealator进行查询路由、子查询分解，并对检索文档进行噪声过滤。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，HANRAG在单跳和多跳问答任务上都表现出优于其他行业领先方法的性能。

Conclusion: HANRAG框架通过创新的查询处理和噪声管理机制，显著提升了RAG系统处理复杂查询的能力和性能。

Abstract: The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach enhances question-answering
systems and dialogue generation tasks by integrating information retrieval (IR)
technologies with large language models (LLMs). This strategy, which retrieves
information from external knowledge bases to bolster the response capabilities
of generative models, has achieved certain successes. However, current RAG
methods still face numerous challenges when dealing with multi-hop queries. For
instance, some approaches overly rely on iterative retrieval, wasting too many
retrieval steps on compound queries. Additionally, using the original complex
query for retrieval may fail to capture content relevant to specific
sub-queries, resulting in noisy retrieved content. If the noise is not managed,
it can lead to the problem of noise accumulation. To address these issues, we
introduce HANRAG, a novel heuristic-based framework designed to efficiently
tackle problems of varying complexity. Driven by a powerful revelator, HANRAG
routes queries, decomposes them into sub-queries, and filters noise from
retrieved documents. This enhances the system's adaptability and noise
resistance, making it highly capable of handling diverse queries. We compare
the proposed framework against other leading industry methods across various
benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our framework obtains superior
performance in both single-hop and multi-hop question-answering tasks.

TL;DR: 这项研究系统测试18种语义相似性测量方法，发现常用嵌入方法存在严重问题，而LLM方法在区分语义差异方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估不同语义相似性测量方法的效果，确定LLM是否真正理解语义关系还是仅仅识别表面模式，以支持代码搜索、API推荐等软件工程应用。

Method: 创建系统化测试框架，对文本和代码进行受控变更，测试18种方法（词汇基础、嵌入技术、LLM基础系统、结构感知算法）在不同类型语义关系上的表现。

Result: 常用指标存在显著问题：某些嵌入方法将语义相反内容错误识别为相似（99.9%），变换器方法有时将相反意义评为比同义词更相似。从欧几里得距离切换为余弦相似性可提高26-66%。LLM方法在区分真正不同意义时表现更好（0.00-0.29 vs 0.82-0.99）。

Conclusion: 当前常用的语义相似性测量方法存在显著缺陷，LLM方法在识别语义差异方面表现更优，但仍需进一步改进。距离计算方法的选择对结果有重要影响。

Abstract: This research examines how well different methods measure semantic
similarity, which is important for various software engineering applications
such as code search, API recommendations, automated code reviews, and
refactoring tools. While large language models are increasingly used for these
similarity assessments, questions remain about whether they truly understand
semantic relationships or merely recognize surface patterns.
  The study tested 18 different similarity measurement approaches, including
word-based methods, embedding techniques, LLM-based systems, and
structure-aware algorithms. The researchers created a systematic testing
framework that applies controlled changes to text and code to evaluate how well
each method handles different types of semantic relationships.
  The results revealed significant issues with commonly used metrics. Some
embedding-based methods incorrectly identified semantic opposites as similar up
to 99.9 percent of the time, while certain transformer-based approaches
occasionally rated opposite meanings as more similar than synonymous ones. The
study found that embedding methods' poor performance often stemmed from how
they calculate distances; switching from Euclidean distance to cosine
similarity improved results by 24 to 66 percent. LLM-based approaches performed
better at distinguishing semantic differences, producing low similarity scores
(0.00 to 0.29) for genuinely different meanings, compared to embedding methods
that incorrectly assigned high scores (0.82 to 0.99) to dissimilar content.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究识别并表征了导致大语言模型产生幻觉的关键符号属性，发现模型规模增大能降低幻觉率但符号元素（修饰词和命名实体）仍然是主要弱点


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型的幻觉问题已被广泛研究，但导致模型内在易产生幻觉的属性尚未被识别和研究，本研究旨在填补这一空白

Method: 使用HaluEval和TruthfulQA两个数据集，将原有的问答格式转换为多种其他格式来识别和验证导致幻觉的关键符号属性

Result: Gemma-2-2B模型在各项任务和数据集上的平均幻觉率为79.0%，随着模型规模增大，Gemma-2-9B降至73.6%，Gemma-2-27B降至63.9%。修饰词（84.76%-94.98%）和命名实体（83.87%-93.96%）在所有模型和数据集上都表现出最高的幻觉率

Conclusion: 符号元素持续使模型混淆，这表明大语言模型在处理此类输入时存在根本性弱点，且这种弱点与模型规模无关

Abstract: Hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a well studied problem.
However, the properties that make LLM intrinsically vulnerable to
hallucinations have not been identified and studied. This research identifies
and characterizes the key properties, allowing us to pinpoint vulnerabilities
within the model's internal mechanisms. To solidify on these properties, we
utilized two established datasets, HaluEval and TruthfulQA and convert their
existing format of question answering into various other formats to narrow down
these properties as the reason for the hallucinations. Our findings reveal that
hallucination percentages across symbolic properties are notably high for
Gemma-2-2B, averaging 79.0% across tasks and datasets. With increased model
scale, hallucination drops to 73.6% for Gemma-2-9B and 63.9% for Gemma-2-27B,
reflecting a 15 percentage point reduction overall. Although the hallucination
rate decreases as the model size increases, a substantial amount of
hallucination caused by symbolic properties still persists. This is especially
evident for modifiers (ranging from 84.76% to 94.98%) and named entities
(ranging from 83.87% to 93.96%) across all Gemma models and both datasets.
These findings indicate that symbolic elements continue to confuse the models,
pointing to a fundamental weakness in how these LLMs process such
inputs--regardless of their scale.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ALIGNS是一个基于大语言模型的系统，用于生成包含55万+指标的综合nomological网络，解决心理测量中建立理论网络的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理测量对许多学科至关重要，但建立nomological网络（概念和测量关系的理论图谱）仍然是70年来的挑战，这导致临床试验可能无法检测治疗效果，公共政策可能针对错误的结果。

Method: 开发ALIGNS系统，使用经过验证的问卷测量训练大语言模型，生成三个综合nomological网络，涵盖心理学、医学、社会政策等领域。

Result: 系统显示NIH PROMIS焦虑和抑郁工具收敛为单一情绪困扰维度；识别儿童气质测量的四个新维度并质疑现有维度；专家评估显示系统的重要性、可访问性和适用性。

Conclusion: ALIGNS是大语言模型首次应用于解决测量验证基础问题，通过大规模nomological分析补充传统验证方法，系统可在nomologicalnetwork.org免费获取。

Abstract: Psychological measurement is critical to many disciplines. Despite advances
in measurement, building nomological networks, theoretical maps of how concepts
and measures relate to establish validity, remains a challenge 70 years after
Cronbach and Meehl proposed them as fundamental to validation. This limitation
has practical consequences: clinical trials may fail to detect treatment
effects, and public policy may target the wrong outcomes. We introduce Analysis
of Latent Indicators to Generate Nomological Structures (ALIGNS), a large
language model-based system trained with validated questionnaire measures.
ALIGNS provides three comprehensive nomological networks containing over
550,000 indicators across psychology, medicine, social policy, and other
fields. This represents the first application of large language models to solve
a foundational problem in measurement validation. We report classification
accuracy tests used to develop the model, as well as three evaluations. In the
first evaluation, the widely used NIH PROMIS anxiety and depression instruments
are shown to converge into a single dimension of emotional distress. The second
evaluation examines child temperament measures and identifies four potential
dimensions not captured by current frameworks, and questions one existing
dimension. The third evaluation, an applicability check, engages expert
psychometricians who assess the system's importance, accessibility, and
suitability. ALIGNS is freely available at nomologicalnetwork.org,
complementing traditional validation methods with large-scale nomological
analysis.

Method: 从专利数据提取文本，通过文本主题映射发现技术间关系，根据主题时间变化识别机会，利用LLM提取主题和chat模型支持发现

Result: 在美国专利局AI专利数据集上验证，显示AI技术正向日常化可访问方向发展

Conclusion: 该框架有效能够识别未来技术机会，为技术预测和创新提供了有力工具

Abstract: Technology opportunities are critical information that serve as a foundation
for advancements in technology, industry, and innovation. This paper proposes a
framework based on the temporal relationships between technologies to identify
emerging technology opportunities. The proposed framework begins by extracting
text from a patent dataset, followed by mapping text-based topics to discover
inter-technology relationships. Technology opportunities are then identified by
tracking changes in these topics over time. To enhance efficiency, the
framework leverages a large language model to extract topics and employs a
prompt for a chat-based language model to support the discovery of technology
opportunities. The framework was evaluated using an artificial intelligence
patent dataset provided by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The
experimental results suggest that artificial intelligence technology is
evolving into forms that facilitate everyday accessibility. This approach
demonstrates the potential of the proposed framework to identify future
technology opportunities.

Motivation: 现有的生物医学实体链接基准主要集中在英语语料库和平坦提及上，缺乏对嵌套和多语言提及的现实场景研究

Method: 采用两阶段检索-排序架构，使用相同的基编码器模型；在排序阶段添加可学习的边界标签[Ms]/[Me]；通过三种互补数据源自动扩展训练语料库

Result: 在BioNNE 2025多语言赛道中排名第三，证明了这些最小但原则性修改的有效性和竞争力

Conclusion: 该方法通过保持原始实体链接模型不变，仅修改三个任务对齐组件，成功解决了多语言生物医学嵌套实体链接的挑战

Abstract: Entity linking (EL) for biomedical text is typically benchmarked on
English-only corpora with flat mentions, leaving the more realistic scenario of
nested and multilingual mentions largely unexplored. We present our system for
the BioNNE 2025 Multilingual Biomedical Nested Named Entity Linking shared task
(English & Russian), closing this gap with a lightweight pipeline that keeps
the original EL model intact and modifies only three task-aligned components:
Two-stage retrieval-ranking. We leverage the same base encoder model in both
stages: the retrieval stage uses the original pre-trained model, while the
ranking stage applies domain-specific fine-tuning. Boundary cues. In the
ranking stage, we wrap each mention with learnable [Ms] / [Me] tags, providing
the encoder with an explicit, language-agnostic span before robustness to
overlap and nesting. Dataset augmentation. We also automatically expand the
ranking training corpus with three complementary data sources, enhancing
coverage without extra manual annotation. On the BioNNE 2025 leaderboard, our
two stage system, bilingual bert (BIBERT-Pipe), ranks third in the multilingual
track, demonstrating the effectiveness and competitiveness of these minimal yet
principled modifications. Code are publicly available at

Motivation: 为了解决形式证明难以被人类理解的问题，利用大型语言模型的能力将机器可验证的形式证明转换为自然语言描述，提高证明的可读性和可访问性

Method: 利用LLM的非形式化（形式语言证明步骤的言语化）和摘要化能力，将形式证明翻译为自然语言。方法在教科书的形式证明数据和Lean证明助手的现有证明库上进行应用和评估

Result: 该方法能够生成高度可读且准确的自然语言证明，通过与原始自然语言证明的对比分析验证了生成质量

Conclusion: 提出的自然语言翻译方法有效解决了形式证明的可读性问题，LLM在证明非形式化方面表现出色，为形式验证系统与人类理解之间搭建了桥梁

Abstract: This paper proposes a natural language translation method for
machine-verifiable formal proofs that leverages the informalization

of LLMs. For evaluation, it was applied to formal proof data created in
accordance with natural language proofs taken from an undergraduate-level
textbook, and the quality of the generated natural language proofs was analyzed
in comparison with the original natural language proofs. Furthermore, we will
demonstrate that this method can output highly readable and accurate natural
language proofs by applying it to existing formal proof library of the Lean

TL;DR: 一种多段式金融问答框架，通过角色提示和批判精炼，在金融教育问题上提升8.3%的准确率，成本效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在金融领域的问答任务中常常无法处理专业的数量推理、领域术语和实际场景理解。

Method: 设计了一个包含Base Generator、Evidence Retriever和Expert Reviewer三个模块的多段式框架，利用RAG技术从6本金融教科书中获取上下文证据，通过单次迭代产生精炼答案。

Result: 在3,532道专家设计的金融教育问题上，该方法比零准链式思考基线提高6.6-8.3%的准确率，Gemini-2.0-Flash表现最佳，GPT-4o-mini能达到专门调整的FinGPT模型的类似性能。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种成本效果显著的方法来提升金融问答性能，为多段式金融LLM系统的进一步研究提供了见解。

Abstract: Question answering (QA) plays a central role in financial education, yet
existing large language model (LLM) approaches often fail to capture the
nuanced and specialized reasoning required for financial problem-solving. The
financial domain demands multistep quantitative reasoning, familiarity with
domain-specific terminology, and comprehension of real-world scenarios. We
present a multi-agent framework that leverages role-based prompting to enhance
performance on domain-specific QA. Our framework comprises a Base Generator, an
Evidence Retriever, and an Expert Reviewer agent that work in a single-pass
iteration to produce a refined answer. We evaluated our framework on a set of
3,532 expert-designed finance education questions from Study.com, an online
learning platform. We leverage retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for
contextual evidence from 6 finance textbooks and prompting strategies for a
domain-expert reviewer. Our experiments indicate that critique-based refinement
improves answer accuracy by 6.6-8.3% over zero-shot Chain-of-Thought baselines,
with the highest performance from Gemini-2.0-Flash. Furthermore, our method
enables GPT-4o-mini to achieve performance comparable to the finance-tuned
FinGPT-mt_Llama3-8B_LoRA. Our results show a cost-effective approach to
enhancing financial QA and offer insights for further research in multi-agent
financial LLM systems.

Motivation: 评估Twitter情感分析中机器学习模型的平均性能，分析研究间的异质性，并探讨研究特征如何影响模型性能

Method: 使用PRISMA指南筛选195个试验（来自20项研究），采用双反正弦变换和三级随机效应模型分析总体准确率

Result: AIC优化模型的平均总体准确率为0.80 [0.76, 0.84]，发现总体准确率因类别不平衡和情感类别数量而具有误导性

Conclusion: 需要规范模型性能报告标准，包括报告独立测试集的混淆矩阵，以实现跨研究的可靠比较

Abstract: This paper presents a meta-analysis evaluating ML performance in sentiment
analysis for Twitter data. The study aims to estimate the average performance,
assess heterogeneity between and within studies, and analyze how study
characteristics influence model performance. Using PRISMA guidelines, we
searched academic databases and selected 195 trials from 20 studies with 12
study features. Overall accuracy, the most reported performance metric, was
analyzed using double arcsine transformation and a three-level random effects
model. The average overall accuracy of the AIC-optimized model was 0.80 [0.76,
0.84]. This paper provides two key insights: 1) Overall accuracy is widely used
but often misleading due to its sensitivity to class imbalance and the number
of sentiment classes, highlighting the need for normalization. 2) Standardized
reporting of model performance, including reporting confusion matrices for
independent test sets, is essential for reliable comparisons of ML classifiers
across studies, which seems far from common practice.

TL;DR: MultimodalHugs是一个基于Hugging Face构建的框架，旨在解决手语处理研究中存在的代码复杂、可复现性差和比较不公平等问题，支持更多样的数据模态和任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手语处理研究面临代码复杂、可复现性差的问题，现有工具如Hugging Face不够灵活，无法无缝集成手语实验，这通过研究者调查得到证实。

Method: 在Hugging Face基础上构建MultimodalHugs框架，增加抽象层以支持更多数据模态和任务，特别是手语姿态估计数据和文本字符像素数据等。

Result: 框架能够容纳多种模态数据，包括手语的姿态估计数据和文本字符的像素数据，通过定量实验验证了其适用性。

Conclusion: MultimodalHugs不仅专注于手语处理，其抽象层设计使其更广泛适用于Hugging Face标准模板之外的其他用例，提升了实验的可复现性和公平性。

Abstract: In recent years, sign language processing (SLP) has gained importance in the
general field of Natural Language Processing. However, compared to research on
spoken languages, SLP research is hindered by complex ad-hoc code,
inadvertently leading to low reproducibility and unfair comparisons. Existing
tools that are built for fast and reproducible experimentation, such as Hugging
Face, are not flexible enough to seamlessly integrate sign language
experiments. This view is confirmed by a survey we conducted among SLP
researchers.
  To address these challenges, we introduce MultimodalHugs, a framework built
on top of Hugging Face that enables more diverse data modalities and tasks,
while inheriting the well-known advantages of the Hugging Face ecosystem. Even
though sign languages are our primary focus, MultimodalHugs adds a layer of
abstraction that makes it more widely applicable to other use cases that do not
fit one of the standard templates of Hugging Face. We provide quantitative
experiments to illustrate how MultimodalHugs can accommodate diverse modalities
such as pose estimation data for sign languages, or pixel data for text
characters.

Motivation: 中国古代文档保存着千年历史文化，但传统数字化方法和现有视觉-语言模型都难以处理其复杂的视觉和语言特征，而现有的文档评测集主要集中在英文或简体中文，缺乏针对古代中文文档的评测标准。

Method: 构建AncientDoc评测基准，包含五个任务：页面级OCR识别、白话翻译、基于推理的问答、基于知识的问答、语言变体问答，涵盖14种文档类型、超100本书籍和约3000页。

Result: 基于AncientDoc对主流视觉-语言模型进行了评测，采用多种指标度量，并配合人类对齐的大语言模型进行分数评分。

Conclusion: AncientDoc是首个专门针对中国古代文档的评测标准，填补了现有文档评测集在古代中文文档方面的空白，为评估视觉-语言模型在古文档处理能力提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Chinese ancient documents, invaluable carriers of millennia of Chinese
history and culture, hold rich knowledge across diverse fields but face
challenges in digitization and understanding, i.e., traditional methods only
scan images, while current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with their
visual and linguistic complexity. Existing document benchmarks focus on English
printed texts or simplified Chinese, leaving a gap for evaluating VLMs on
ancient Chinese documents. To address this, we present AncientDoc, the first
benchmark for Chinese ancient documents, designed to assess VLMs from OCR to
knowledge reasoning. AncientDoc includes five tasks (page-level OCR, vernacular
translation, reasoning-based QA, knowledge-based QA, linguistic variant QA) and
covers 14 document types, over 100 books, and about 3,000 pages. Based on
AncientDoc, we evaluate mainstream VLMs using multiple metrics, supplemented by
a human-aligned large language model for scoring.

Motivation: 现有的基准测试无法准确评估MCP协议下AI代理的真实性能，导致对其操作价值的误解和能力差异的不可靠区分。

Method: 建立了包含33个操作服务器和188个不同工具的MCP测试平台，设计了600个系统化查询分布在6个不同复杂度的交互类别中，并引入了MCP-Eval结果导向的评估方法。

Result: 通过对领先语言代理的广泛实证评估，提供了基础性见解，展示了不同代理在MCP环境下的性能差异。

Conclusion: MCP-AgentBench为研究社区提供了标准化和可靠的框架，用于构建、验证和推进能够充分利用MCP变革性优势的AI代理，加速真正能力和互操作性AI系统的发展。

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is rapidly emerging as a pivotal open
standard, designed to enhance agent-tool integration and interoperability, and
is positioned to unlock a new era of powerful, interconnected, and genuinely
utilitarian agentic AI. However, despite MCP's growing adoption, existing
benchmarks often fail to capture real-world agent performance within this new
paradigm, leading to a distorted perception of their true operational value and
an inability to reliably differentiate proficiencies. To bridge this critical
evaluation gap, we introduce MCP-AgentBench -- a comprehensive benchmark
specifically engineered to rigorously assess language agent capabilities in
MCP-mediated tool interactions. Core contributions of MCP-AgentBench include:
the establishment of a robust MCP testbed comprising 33 operational servers
with 188 distinct tools; the development of a benchmark featuring 600
systematically designed queries distributed across 6 distinct categories of
varying interaction complexity; and the introduction of MCP-Eval, a novel
outcome-oriented evaluation methodology prioritizing real-world task success.
Through extensive empirical evaluation of leading language agents, we provide
foundational insights. MCP-AgentBench aims to equip the research community with
a standardized and reliable framework to build, validate, and advance agents
capable of fully leveraging MCP's transformative benefits, thereby accelerating
progress toward truly capable and interoperable AI systems.

TL;DR: 这项研究分析了LLM在决策和摘要任务中的偏见问题，发现GPT-3.5和GPT-4o在决策中存在显著偏见，偏向女性、年轻者和非洲美后装。摘要任务偏见较少，跨语言偏见模式相似，提示指令策略能部分减少偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛集成，对社会不平等和信息偏见的担忧日益增加。本研究意在识别和量化LLM在不同任务中的偏见问题，并探索有效的缩减策略。

Method: 使用英语和荷兰语版本的数据集，创建了30万个提示词，测试GPT-3.5和GPT-4o在决策和摘要任务中的表现。测试了不同人口统计变量、指令类型、显著性水平和语言。评估了提示指令缩减策略的效果。

Result: 两款模型在决策任务中都显示出显著偏见：偏向女性、年轻年龄段和非洲美后装。摘要任务偏见较少，仅GPT-3.5在英语中显示年龄相关差异。跨语言偏见模式相似但有些微差。提示指令策略能部分减少偏见，最佳指令平均减少27%偏见差距。GPT-4o在英语中显示更少偏见。

Conclusion: 研究强调了慎重采用LLM的重要性和上下文特定偏见测试的必要性。虽然提示指令策略无法完全消除偏见，但能够有效减少偏见，新型号模型如GPT-4o在提示缩减方面显示出特别潜力。需要继续发展有效的缩减策略以确保AI的负责任部署。

Abstract: The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into various domains
raises concerns about societal inequalities and information bias. This study
examines biases in LLMs related to background, gender, and age, with a focus on
their impact on decision-making and summarization tasks. Additionally, the
research examines the cross-lingual propagation of these biases and evaluates
the effectiveness of prompt-instructed mitigation strategies. Using an adapted
version of the dataset by Tamkin et al. (2023) translated into Dutch, we
created 151,200 unique prompts for the decision task and 176,400 for the
summarisation task. Various demographic variables, instructions, salience
levels, and languages were tested on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o. Our analysis revealed
that both models were significantly biased during decision-making, favouring
female gender, younger ages, and certain backgrounds such as the
African-American background. In contrast, the summarisation task showed minimal
evidence of bias, though significant age-related differences emerged for
GPT-3.5 in English. Cross-lingual analysis showed that bias patterns were
broadly similar between English and Dutch, though notable differences were
observed across specific demographic categories. The newly proposed mitigation
instructions, while unable to eliminate biases completely, demonstrated
potential in reducing them. The most effective instruction achieved a 27\% mean
reduction in the gap between the most and least favorable demographics.
Notably, contrary to GPT-3.5, GPT-4o displayed reduced biases for all prompts
in English, indicating the specific potential for prompt-based mitigation
within newer models. This research underscores the importance of cautious
adoption of LLMs and context-specific bias testing, highlighting the need for
continued development of effective mitigation strategies to ensure responsible
deployment of AI.

TL;DR: HEFT是一种分层高效微调策略，结合了LoRA和ReFT两种参数高效微调方法，在BoolQ推理基准上以更少的训练周期实现了更好的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的专业化推理任务适配受计算资源限制，虽然参数高效微调(PEFT)方法有效，但不同方法在权重空间和表示空间各有优势，需要探索协同组合的可能性

Method: 提出HEFT分层适配策略：先在权重空间使用LoRA进行广泛基础适配，然后在表示空间使用ReFT进行精确精细化调整，形成从粗到细的层次化微调

Result: 在Llama-2-7B模型和BoolQ基准测试中，仅训练3个周期的HEFT达到85.17%准确率，优于训练20个周期的LoRA-only(85.05%)和ReFT-only(83.36%)方法

Conclusion: PEFT方法的精心组合是强大的算法创新，为提升语言模型推理能力提供了更高效有效的路径，能以更少计算预算获得更优结果

Abstract: The adaptation of large language models (LLMs) to specialized reasoning tasks
is fundamentally constrained by computational resources. Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as a powerful solution, yet the
landscape of these techniques is diverse, with distinct methods operating in
either the model's weight space or its representation space. This paper
investigates the hypothesis that a synergistic combination of these paradigms
can unlock superior performance and efficiency. We introduce HEFT (Hierarchical
Efficient Fine-Tuning), a novel hierarchical adaptation strategy that composes
two distinct PEFT methods in a coarse-to-fine manner: first, a broad,
foundational adaptation in the weight space using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA),
followed by a precise, surgical refinement of internal activations using
Representation Fine-Tuning (ReFT). We evaluate this approach by fine-tuning a
Llama-2-7B model on the BoolQ benchmark, a challenging dataset for inferential
reasoning. Our results reveal a profound synergistic effect. A model fine-tuned
for only three epochs with our HEFT strategy achieves an accuracy of 85.17\%,
exceeding the performance of models trained for 20 epochs with either LoRA-only
(85.05\%) or ReFT-only (83.36\%) methodologies. This work demonstrates that the
thoughtful composition of PEFT methods is a potent algorithmic innovation,
offering a more efficient and effective path toward advancing the reasoning
capabilities of language models. By achieving superior results with a fraction
of the computational budget, our findings present a principled approach to
overcoming the obstacles inherent in adapting large-scale models for complex
cognitive tasks.

Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for modeling multimodal conversational turn
organization via the proposition of correlations between language and
interactive gestures, based on analysis as to how pragmatic frames are
conceptualized and evoked by communicators. As a means to provide evidence for
the analysis, we developed an annotation methodology to enrich a multimodal
dataset (annotated for semantic frames) with pragmatic frames modeling
conversational turn organization. Although conversational turn organization has
been studied by researchers from diverse fields, the specific strategies,
especially gestures used by communicators, had not yet been encoded in a
dataset that can be used for machine learning. To fill this gap, we enriched
the Frame2 dataset with annotations of gestures used for turn organization. The
Frame2 dataset features 10 episodes from the Brazilian TV series Pedro Pelo
Mundo annotated for semantic frames evoked in both video and text. This dataset
allowed us to closely observe how communicators use interactive gestures
outside a laboratory, in settings, to our knowledge, not previously recorded in
related literature. Our results have confirmed that communicators involved in
face-to-face conversation make use of gestures as a tool for passing, taking
and keeping conversational turns, and also revealed variations of some gestures
that had not been documented before. We propose that the use of these gestures
arises from the conceptualization of pragmatic frames, involving mental spaces,
blending and conceptual metaphors. In addition, our data demonstrate that the
annotation of pragmatic frames contributes to a deeper understanding of human
cognition and language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在单文档摘要中表现优异，但在多文档摘要中仍有改进空间，需要更好地整合多源信息并保持连贯性和主题相关性

Method: 使用主题标签明确提示模型，并在Group Relative Policy Optimization框架中引入新颖的主题奖励机制来衡量生成摘要与源文档的主题对齐度

Result: 在Multi-News和Multi-XScience数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法 consistently优于强基线模型

Conclusion: 利用主题线索在多文档摘要中是有效的，主题引导的强化学习方法能够显著提升摘要质量

Abstract: A key challenge in Multi-Document Summarization (MDS) is effectively
integrating information from multiple sources while maintaining coherence and
topical relevance. While Large Language Models have shown impressive results in
single-document summarization, their performance on MDS still leaves room for
improvement. In this paper, we propose a topic-guided reinforcement learning
approach to improve content selection in MDS. We first show that explicitly
prompting models with topic labels enhances the informativeness of the
generated summaries. Building on this insight, we propose a novel topic reward
within the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework to measure topic
alignment between the generated summary and source documents. Experimental
results on the Multi-News and Multi-XScience datasets demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the
effectiveness of leveraging topical cues in MDS.

TL;DR: 评估大型语言模型生成合成调查回复的可靠性，与智利概率抽样调查的人类真实回复对比，发现LLM在信任项目上表现优异，但存在项目级异质性和年龄偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在调查研究中提供方法创新，通过合成受访者模拟人类回答，但需要验证其是否能准确恢复总体项目分布，避免复制训练数据中的社会刻板印象和偏见。

Method: 使用128个提示-模型-问题三元组生成189,696个合成档案，通过准确性、精确度、召回率和F1分数等指标，在128个问题-子样本对上进行元分析，测试关键社会人口统计维度的偏差。

Result: 1) 合成回复在信任项目上表现优异(F1分数和准确性>0.90)；2) GPT-4o、GPT-4o-mini和Llama 4 Maverick表现相当；3) 45-59岁受访者的合成-人类对齐度最高。

Conclusion: LLM合成样本能够近似概率样本的回答，但存在显著的项目级异质性，需要仔细校准和额外分布测试以确保算法保真度和减少错误。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising avenues for methodological and
applied innovations in survey research by using synthetic respondents to
emulate human answers and behaviour, potentially mitigating measurement and
representation errors. However, the extent to which LLMs recover aggregate item
distributions remains uncertain and downstream applications risk reproducing
social stereotypes and biases inherited from training data. We evaluate the
reliability of LLM-generated synthetic survey responses against ground-truth
human responses from a Chilean public opinion probabilistic survey.
Specifically, we benchmark 128 prompt-model-question triplets, generating
189,696 synthetic profiles, and pool performance metrics (i.e., accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1-score) in a meta-analysis across 128
question-subsample pairs to test for biases along key sociodemographic
dimensions. The evaluation spans OpenAI's GPT family and o-series reasoning
models, as well as Llama and Qwen checkpoints. Three results stand out. First,
synthetic responses achieve excellent performance on trust items (F1-score and
accuracy > 0.90). Second, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini and Llama 4 Maverick perform
comparably on this task. Third, synthetic-human alignment is highest among
respondents aged 45-59. Overall, LLM-based synthetic samples approximate
responses from a probabilistic sample, though with substantial item-level
heterogeneity. Capturing the full nuance of public opinion remains challenging
and requires careful calibration and additional distributional tests to ensure
algorithmic fidelity and reduce errors.

Abstract: Minority languages in China, such as Tibetan, Uyghur, and Traditional
Mongolian, face significant challenges due to their unique writing systems,
which differ from international standards. This discrepancy has led to a severe
lack of relevant corpora, particularly for supervised tasks like headline
generation. To address this gap, we introduce a novel dataset, Chinese Minority
Headline Generation (CMHG), which includes 100,000 entries for Tibetan, and
50,000 entries each for Uyghur and Mongolian, specifically curated for headline
generation tasks. Additionally, we propose a high-quality test set annotated by
native speakers, designed to serve as a benchmark for future research in this
domain. We hope this dataset will become a valuable resource for advancing
headline generation in Chinese minority languages and contribute to the
development of related benchmarks.

TL;DR: IRIS是一个无监督幻觉检测框架，利用LLM内部表征来检测生成内容的事实正确性，无需标注数据，计算成本低且适用于实时检测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督方法依赖与事实正确性无关的代理信号，导致检测偏向表面特征，限制了跨数据集和场景的泛化能力

Method: 通过提示LLM验证陈述的真实性，获取其上下文嵌入作为特征，同时将响应不确定性作为真实性的软伪标签

Result: 实验结果表明IRIS consistently outperforms existing unsupervised methods，在少量训练数据下也能良好工作

Conclusion: IRIS是一个完全无监督、计算成本低、适用于实时检测的有效幻觉检测框架

Abstract: Unsupervised hallucination detection aims to identify hallucinated content
generated by large language models (LLMs) without relying on labeled data.
While unsupervised methods have gained popularity by eliminating
labor-intensive human annotations, they frequently rely on proxy signals
unrelated to factual correctness. This misalignment biases detection probes
toward superficial or non-truth-related aspects, limiting generalizability
across datasets and scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose IRIS,
an unsupervised hallucination detection framework, leveraging internal
representations intrinsic to factual correctness. IRIS prompts the LLM to
carefully verify the truthfulness of a given statement, and obtain its
contextualized embedding as informative features for training. Meanwhile, the
uncertainty of each response is considered a soft pseudolabel for truthfulness.
Experimental results demonstrate that IRIS consistently outperforms existing
unsupervised methods. Our approach is fully unsupervised, computationally low
cost, and works well even with few training data, making it suitable for
real-time detection.

Motivation: 研究开源大语言模型在消费硬件上执行多标签意图分类的效果，为任务导向对话系统提供自然语言理解方案。

Method: 使用MultiWOZ 2.1数据集，在少量示例设置下测试三种开源LLM模型，与BERT监督分类器进行性能对比。

Result: Mistral-7B在14个意图类别中有11个表现最好，加权F1平均分为0.50，但BERT监督分类器性能更优。

Conclusion: 开源LLM在消费硬件上可以执行多标签意图分类，Mistral-7B表现最好，但监督学习方法仍有性能优势。

Abstract: In this paper, we provide an extensive analysis of multi-label intent
classification using Large Language Models (LLMs) that are open-source,
publicly available, and can be run in consumer hardware. We use the MultiWOZ
2.1 dataset, a benchmark in the dialogue system domain, to investigate the
efficacy of three popular open-source pre-trained LLMs, namely LLama2-7B-hf,
Mistral-7B-v0.1, and Yi-6B. We perform the classification task in a few-shot
setup, giving 20 examples in the prompt with some instructions. Our approach
focuses on the differences in performance of these models across several
performance metrics by methodically assessing these models on multi-label
intent classification tasks. Additionally, we compare the performance of the
instruction-based fine-tuning approach with supervised learning using the
smaller transformer model BertForSequenceClassification as a baseline. To
evaluate the performance of the models, we use evaluation metrics like
accuracy, precision, and recall as well as micro, macro, and weighted F1 score.
We also report the inference time, VRAM requirements, etc. The Mistral-7B-v0.1
outperforms two other generative models on 11 intent classes out of 14 in terms
of F-Score, with a weighted average of 0.50. It also has relatively lower
Humming Loss and higher Jaccard Similarity, making it the winning model in the
few-shot setting. We find BERT based supervised classifier having superior
performance compared to the best performing few-shot generative LLM. The study
provides a framework for small open-source LLMs in detecting complex
multi-intent dialogues, enhancing the Natural Language Understanding aspect of
task-oriented chatbots.

TL;DR: 通过分析社交媒体语言来研究双相感矛盾障碍(BD)的语言标记，发现诊断前后长达24年的语言变化轨迹，包括情绪涉及、兼存症、物质滥用等多种症状，并观察到周期性的季节性情绪发作模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言是情感障碍的重要标记物，但传统临床评估规模有限。社交媒体语言分析具有高时间分辨率和纵向范围的优势，可以进行大规模的精神健康监测。

Method: 开发了一种方法来确定用户的诊断时间，并分析了从诊断前3年到诊断后21年的语言轨迹，与单相抑郁用户和非受影响用户进行对比。

Result: 发现BD诊断伴随着普遍的语言改变，反映出情绪扰动、精神兼存症、物质滥用、住院治疗、医学兼存症、异常思维内容和思维混乱。在诊断后两十年内观察到周期性的情绪相关语言变化，具有显著的12个月周期性，可能表明季节性情绪发作。估计为女性的用户显示出更高的周期性。

Conclusion: 研究结果为BD急性期和慢性期的语言改变提供了证据，验证并扩展了利用社交媒体进行可扩展的精神健康监测的最新尝试。

Abstract: Language provides valuable markers of affective disorders such as bipolar
disorder (BD), yet clinical assessments remain limited in scale. In response,
analyses of social media (SM) language have gained prominence due to their high
temporal resolution and longitudinal scope. Here, we introduce a method to
determine the timing of users' diagnoses and apply it to study language
trajectories from 3 years before to 21 years after BD diagnosis - contrasted
with uses reporting unipolar depression (UD) and non-affected users (HC). We
show that BD diagnosis is accompanied by pervasive linguistic alterations
reflecting mood disturbance, psychiatric comorbidity, substance abuse,
hospitalization, medical comorbidities, unusual thought content, and
disorganized thought. We further observe recurring mood-related language
changes across two decades after the diagnosis, with a pronounced 12-month
periodicity suggestive of seasonal mood episodes. Finally, trend-level evidence
suggests an increased periodicity in users estimated to be female. In sum, our
findings provide evidence for language alterations in the acute and chronic
phase of BD. This validates and extends recent efforts leveraging SM for
scalable monitoring of mental health.

Abstract: We present MSAs winning system for the BAREC 2025 Shared Task on fine-grained
Arabic readability assessment, achieving first place in six of six tracks. Our
approach is a confidence-weighted ensemble of four complementary transformer
models (AraBERTv2, AraELECTRA, MARBERT, and CAMeLBERT) each fine-tuned with
distinct loss functions to capture diverse readability signals. To tackle
severe class imbalance and data scarcity, we applied weighted training,
advanced preprocessing, SAMER corpus relabeling with our strongest model, and
synthetic data generation via Gemini 2.5 Flash, adding about 10,000 rare-level
samples. A targeted post-processing step corrected prediction distribution
skew, delivering a 6.3 percent Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) gain. Our system
reached 87.5 percent QWK at the sentence level and 87.4 percent at the document
level, demonstrating the power of model and loss diversity, confidence-informed
fusion, and intelligent augmentation for robust Arabic readability prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将人类心理测量问卷直接应用于LLMs，但这种方法的生态效度受到质疑，需要明确两种问卷在结果上的差异及其含义

Method: 进行了两种问卷类型（传统心理测量问卷与生态有效问卷）的综合对比分析

Result: 发现传统问卷：(1)与生态有效问卷在LLMs人格特征上存在显著差异；(2)项目数量不足导致测量不稳定；(3)会产生LLMs拥有稳定构造的误导印象；(4)对人设提示的LLMs产生夸张的人格描述

Conclusion: 建议谨慎使用传统心理测量问卷来测量LLMs的人格特征，因为它们在生态效度、测量稳定性和构造有效性方面存在显著缺陷

Abstract: Researchers have applied established psychometric questionnaires (e.g., BFI,
PVQ) to measure the personality traits and values reflected in the responses of
Large Language Models (LLMs). However, concerns have been raised about applying
these human-designed questionnaires to LLMs. One such concern is their lack of
ecological validity--the extent to which survey questions adequately reflect
and resemble real-world contexts in which LLMs generate texts in response to
user queries. However, it remains unclear how established questionnaires and
ecologically valid questionnaires differ in their outcomes, and what insights
these differences may provide. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive
comparative analysis of the two types of questionnaires. Our analysis reveals
that established questionnaires (1) yield substantially different profiles of
LLMs from ecologically valid ones, deviating from the psychological
characteristics expressed in the context of user queries, (2) suffer from
insufficient items for stable measurement, (3) create misleading impressions
that LLMs possess stable constructs, and (4) yield exaggerated profiles for
persona-prompted LLMs. Overall, our work cautions against the use of
established psychological questionnaires for LLMs. Our code will be released
upon publication.

Conclusion: 该工作超越了知识图谱的构建本身，展示了其在气候研究、模型开发等实际应用中的价值，为依赖准确、上下文科学信息的用户提供了实用工具。

Abstract: The growing complexity and volume of climate science literature make it
increasingly difficult for researchers to find relevant information across
models, datasets, regions, and variables. This paper introduces a
domain-specific Knowledge Graph (KG) built from climate publications and
broader scientific texts, aimed at improving how climate knowledge is accessed
and used. Unlike keyword based search, our KG supports structured, semantic
queries that help researchers discover precise connections such as which models
have been validated in specific regions or which datasets are commonly used
with certain teleconnection patterns. We demonstrate how the KG answers such
questions using Cypher queries, and outline its integration with large language
models in RAG systems to improve transparency and reliability in
climate-related question answering. This work moves beyond KG construction to
show its real world value for climate researchers, model developers, and others
who rely on accurate, contextual scientific information.

Motivation: 解决现有医院管理系统在提供准确实时医疗建议方面的不足，特别是对于不规则输入和代表性不足的语言，以改善全球健康管理面临的挑战。

Method: 收集社交媒体平台上真实医疗对话数据集，包含患者抵达和医生建议，细调Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2、LLaMA-2-7B和GPT-2 Medium等生成模型，适应多种阿拉伯方言。

Result: 细调后的Mistral-7B模型表现最佳，在BERT评分中达到精准68.5%、召回69.08%、F1分数68.5%，能够生成结构正确、相关的医疗回复。

Conclusion: 生成式人工智能在医院管理系统中具有巨大潜力，特别是在语言和文化多样性环境中，提供可扩展的适应性解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient hospital management systems (HMS) are critical worldwide to address
challenges such as overcrowding, limited resources, and poor availability of
urgent health care. Existing methods often lack the ability to provide
accurate, real-time medical advice, particularly for irregular inputs and
underrepresented languages. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes
an approach that fine-tunes large language models (LLMs) for Arabic medical
text generation. The system is designed to assist patients by providing
accurate medical advice, diagnoses, drug recommendations, and treatment plans
based on user input. The research methodology required the collection of a
unique dataset from social media platforms, capturing real-world medical
conversations between patients and doctors. The dataset, which includes patient
complaints together with medical advice, was properly cleaned and preprocessed
to account for multiple Arabic dialects. Fine-tuning state-of-the-art
generative models, such as Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, LLaMA-2-7B, and GPT-2
Medium, optimized the system's ability to generate reliable medical text.
Results from evaluations indicate that the fine-tuned Mistral-7B model
outperformed the other models, achieving average BERT (Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers) Score values in precision, recall, and
F1-scores of 68.5\%, 69.08\%, and 68.5\%, respectively. Comparative
benchmarking and qualitative assessments validate the system's ability to
produce coherent and relevant medical replies to informal input. This study
highlights the potential of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in
advancing HMS, offering a scalable and adaptable solution for global healthcare
challenges, especially in linguistically and culturally diverse environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语医疗数据集稀缺且质量不高，限制了医疗聊天机器人的发展。需要找到一种可扩展的方法来解决这个问题。

Method: 使用ChatGPT-4o和Gemini 2.5 Pro生成80,000条综合数据，经过语义筛选和手动验证。对5个LLM进行微调，包括Mistral-7B和AraGPT2，并使用BERTScore指标和专家评估进行性能分析。

Result: ChatGPT-4o生成的数据在所有模型中都导致更高的F1分数和更少的幻觉现象。综合数据扩充策略显著提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: 综合数据扩充是一种可行的方案，可以在资源稀缺的医疗NLP领域提升域特定语言模型的性能，为更包容、可扩展和准确的阿拉伯语医疗聊天机器人系统打开道路。

Abstract: The development of medical chatbots in Arabic is significantly constrained by
the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality annotated datasets. While prior
efforts compiled a dataset of 20,000 Arabic patient-doctor interactions from
social media to fine-tune large language models (LLMs), model scalability and
generalization remained limited. In this study, we propose a scalable synthetic
data augmentation strategy to expand the training corpus to 100,000 records.
Using advanced generative AI systems ChatGPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro we generated
80,000 contextually relevant and medically coherent synthetic question-answer
pairs grounded in the structure of the original dataset. These synthetic
samples were semantically filtered, manually validated, and integrated into the
training pipeline. We fine-tuned five LLMs, including Mistral-7B and AraGPT2,
and evaluated their performance using BERTScore metrics and expert-driven
qualitative assessments. To further analyze the effectiveness of synthetic
sources, we conducted an ablation study comparing ChatGPT-4o and
Gemini-generated data independently. The results showed that ChatGPT-4o data
consistently led to higher F1-scores and fewer hallucinations across all
models. Overall, our findings demonstrate the viability of synthetic
augmentation as a practical solution for enhancing domain-specific language
models in-low resource medical NLP, paving the way for more inclusive,
scalable, and accurate Arabic healthcare chatbot systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过结合显著性检测和语音识别来提升对话式德语的自动语音识别性能，为语言学研究和语调信息对话系统提供应用潜力

Method: 首先细调wav2vec2模型开发单词级显著性检测器，然后用其自动标注大量语料中的语调显著性，最后训练能同时输出词语和显著性级别的新型ASR系统

Result: 集成显著性信息后ASR性能与基准系统相当，但在识别正确的语句中显著性检测精度达到85.53%，Transformer模型能有效编码语调信息

Conclusion: 该研究证明了变换器模型在编码语调信息方面的有效性，为语调增强的语音识别领域做出了新颖贡献

Abstract: This paper investigates prominence-aware automatic speech recognition (ASR)
by combining prominence detection and speech recognition for conversational
Austrian German. First, prominence detectors were developed by fine-tuning
wav2vec2 models to classify word-level prominence. The detector was then used
to automatically annotate prosodic prominence in a large corpus. Based on those
annotations, we trained novel prominence-aware ASR systems that simultaneously
transcribe words and their prominence levels. The integration of prominence
information did not change performance compared to our baseline ASR system,
while reaching a prominence detection accuracy of 85.53% for utterances where
the recognized word sequence was correct. This paper shows that
transformer-based models can effectively encode prosodic information and
represents a novel contribution to prosody-enhanced ASR, with potential
applications for linguistic research and prosody-informed dialogue systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled human-like
social simulations at unprecedented scale and fidelity, offering new
opportunities for computational social science. A key challenge, however, is
the construction of persona sets that authentically represent the diversity and
distribution of real-world populations. Most existing LLM-based social
simulation studies focus primarily on designing agentic frameworks and
simulation environments, often overlooking the complexities of persona
generation and the potential biases introduced by unrepresentative persona
sets. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for synthesizing
high-quality, population-aligned persona sets for LLM-driven social simulation.
Our approach begins by leveraging LLMs to generate narrative personas from
long-term social media data, followed by rigorous quality assessment to filter
out low-fidelity profiles. We then apply importance sampling to achieve global
alignment with reference psychometric distributions, such as the Big Five
personality traits. To address the needs of specific simulation contexts, we
further introduce a task-specific module that adapts the globally aligned
persona set to targeted subpopulations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method significantly reduces population-level bias and enables accurate,
flexible social simulation for a wide range of research and policy
applications.

TL;DR: DocExplainerV0是一个即插即用的边界框预测模块，将答案生成与空间定位解耦，解决了现有视觉语言模型在文档中精确定位答案的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在文档理解方面表现出色，但在文档中精确定位答案方面存在重大挑战，这限制了模型的可解释性和实际应用。

Method: 提出了DocExplainerV0模块，采用解耦设计将答案生成与空间定位分离，可应用于现有VLM系统，包括无法进行微调的专有系统。

Result: 系统评估揭示了文本准确性与空间定位之间的差距，显示正确答案往往缺乏可靠的空间定位。

Conclusion: 该标准化框架突出了现有方法的不足，为未来开发更可解释和鲁棒的文档信息提取VLM建立了基准。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong capabilities in document
understanding, particularly in identifying and extracting textual information
from complex documents. Despite this, accurately localizing answers within
documents remains a major challenge, limiting both interpretability and
real-world applicability. To address this, we introduce
\textit{DocExplainerV0}, a plug-and-play bounding-box prediction module that
decouples answer generation from spatial localization. This design makes it
applicable to existing VLMs, including proprietary systems where fine-tuning is
not feasible. Through systematic evaluation, we provide quantitative insights
into the gap between textual accuracy and spatial grounding, showing that
correct answers often lack reliable localization. Our standardized framework
highlights these shortcomings and establishes a benchmark for future research
toward more interpretable and robust document information extraction VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型与人类文本在语域特征上的系统性差异，并考虑到非英语语言在LLM训练数据中的代表性不足问题。

Method: 采用Biber多维分析法，使用AI-Brown和AI-Koditex语料库，对比16个前沿模型在不同设置和提示下生成的文本进行分析，特别注重基础模型与指令微调模型的对比。

Result: 发现LLM与人类文本在多个语域维度上存在显著差异，指令微调模型更接近人类文本特征，并成功构建了可用于模型比较和排名的解释性基准。

Conclusion: 该研究为评估LLM文本生成能力提供了新的解释性工具，显示了模型类型和语言特征对文本语域形态的影响。

Abstract: This study investigates the register variation in texts written by humans and
comparable texts produced by large language models (LLMs). Biber's
multidimensional analysis (MDA) is applied to a sample of human-written texts
and AI-created texts generated to be their counterparts to find the dimensions
of variation in which LLMs differ most significantly and most systematically
from humans. As textual material, a new LLM-generated corpus AI-Brown is used,
which is comparable to BE-21 (a Brown family corpus representing contemporary
British English). Since all languages except English are underrepresented in
the training data of frontier LLMs, similar analysis is replicated on Czech
using AI-Koditex corpus and Czech multidimensional model. Examined were 16
frontier models in various settings and prompts, with emphasis placed on the
difference between base models and instruction-tuned models. Based on this, a
benchmark is created through which models can be compared with each other and
ranked in interpretable dimensions.

TL;DR: 本文研究情感支持对话中不协调的积极回应问题，发现在高风险情境下LLM更容易产生不切实际的积极回应，提出了改进检测方法和平衡情感支持的建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究情感支持对话中善意但可能适得其反的积极回应现象，特别是在人类和LLM生成回应中都存在的积极支持表达不协调问题。

Method: 收集Reddit真实用户-助手对话，按情感强度分类为轻度（关系紧张、一般建议）和重度（悲伤、焦虑），使用LLM生成额外回应，微调LLM并开发弱监督多标签分类器集成。

Result: 发现LLM在高风险情境下更容易通过轻描淡写和最小化语气表现出不切实际的积极性，开发的分类器在检测不协调积极性类型方面表现改善。

Conclusion: 需要超越生成通用积极回应，研究协调的支持措施来平衡积极情感与情感认同，为构建情境感知和信任保持的在线对话系统铺平道路。

Abstract: In emotionally supportive conversations, well-intended positivity can
sometimes misfire, leading to responses that feel dismissive, minimizing, or
unrealistically optimistic. We examine this phenomenon of incongruent
positivity as miscalibrated expressions of positive support in both human and
LLM generated responses. To this end, we collected real user-assistant
dialogues from Reddit across a range of emotional intensities and generated
additional responses using large language models for the same context. We
categorize these conversations by intensity into two levels: Mild, which covers
relationship tension and general advice, and Severe, which covers grief and
anxiety conversations. This level of categorization enables a comparative
analysis of how supportive responses vary across lower and higher stakes
contexts. Our analysis reveals that LLMs are more prone to unrealistic
positivity through dismissive and minimizing tone, particularly in high-stakes
contexts. To further study the underlying dimensions of this phenomenon, we
finetune LLMs on datasets with strong and weak emotional reactions. Moreover,
we developed a weakly supervised multilabel classifier ensemble (DeBERTa and
MentalBERT) that shows improved detection of incongruent positivity types
across two sorts of concerns (Mild and Severe). Our findings shed light on the
need to move beyond merely generating generic positive responses and instead
study the congruent support measures to balance positive affect with emotional
acknowledgment. This approach offers insights into aligning large language
models with affective expectations in the online supportive dialogue, paving
the way toward context-aware and trust preserving online conversation systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文比较了多种大语言模型在处理长文本分类任务（特别是法律文件）时的性能，发现专门为长文本设计的Longformer模型并无明显优势，开源模型在某些方面表现优于GPT变体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主流语言模型（如BERT及其衍生模型）在处理长文本输入时存在长度限制，这对于需要处理数百页法律文件的分类任务构成了严重挑战。

Method: 使用XLM-RoBERTa、Longformer、GPT-3.5和GPT-4四种模型，在5种语言上进行多类别分类实验，采用比较议程项目的21个政策主题标签分类体系。

Result: 专门为长文本预训练的Longformer模型没有显示出明显优势；开源模型在比较中表现优于GPT变体；类别级别的分析显示特定类别之间的支持度和内容重叠对长文本处理性能有重要影响。

Conclusion: 在处理长文本分类任务时，专门的长文本模型不一定优于通用模型，开源模型在某些场景下可能比商业GPT模型表现更好，类别间的语义重叠是影响分类性能的关键因素。

Abstract: The most widely used large language models in the social sciences (such as
BERT, and its derivatives, e.g. RoBERTa) have a limitation on the input text
length that they can process to produce predictions. This is a particularly
pressing issue for some classification tasks, where the aim is to handle long
input texts. One such area deals with laws and draft laws (bills), which can
have a length of multiple hundred pages and, therefore, are not particularly
amenable for processing with models that can only handle e.g. 512 tokens. In
this paper, we show results from experiments covering 5 languages with
XLM-RoBERTa, Longformer, GPT-3.5, GPT-4 models for the multiclass
classification task of the Comparative Agendas Project, which has a codebook of
21 policy topic labels from education to health care. Results show no
particular advantage for the Longformer model, pre-trained specifically for the
purposes of handling long inputs. The comparison between the GPT variants and
the best-performing open model yielded an edge for the latter. An analysis of
class-level factors points to the importance of support and substance overlaps
between specific categories when it comes to performance on long text inputs.

TL;DR: 提出Self Improving Faithfulness Aware Contrastive Tuning框架，通过自指导机制自动生成对比学习数据，提升LLM在知识冲突任务中的忠实性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在知识密集型任务中经常生成不忠实的响应，倾向于依赖内部参数知识而非提供的上下文，存在知识冲突问题

Method: 使用自指导机制自动生成高质量结构化对比学习数据（锚样本、语义等价正样本、模拟不忠实场景的负样本），然后应用对比学习训练模型

Result: 在ECARE KRE和COSE KRE基准测试中，基于Llama3 8B Instruct的SI FACT模型将上下文召回率提高了6.2%，显著减少了对内部记忆的依赖

Conclusion: SI FACT在增强LLM上下文忠实性方面具有强效性和高数据效率，为构建更主动和可信的语言模型提供了实用途径

Abstract: Large Language Models often generate unfaithful responses in knowledge
intensive tasks due to knowledge conflict,that is,a preference for relying on
internal parametric knowledge rather than the provided context.To address this
issue,we propose a novel self improving framework,Self Improving Faithfulness
Aware Contrastive Tuning.The framework uses a self instruct mechanism that
allows the base LLM to automatically generate high quality,structured
contrastive learning data,including anchor samples,semantically equivalent
positive samples,and negative samples simulating unfaithful scenarios.This
approach significantly reduces the cost of manual
annotation.Subsequently,contrastive learning is applied to train the
model,enabling it to pull faithful responses closer and push unfaithful
responses farther apart in the representation space.Experiments on knowledge
conflict evaluation benchmarks ECARE KRE and COSE KRE show that the SI FACT
model based on Llama3 8B Instruct improves the Contextual Recall Rate by 6.2%
over the best baseline method,while significantly reducing dependence on
internal memory.The results indicate that SI FACT provides strong effectiveness
and high data efficiency in enhancing the contextual faithfulness of
LLMs,offering a practical pathway toward building more proactive and
trustworthy language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DERN是一种无需重新训练的任务无关框架，通过专家剪枝和神经元重组来减少稀疏混合专家模型的内存使用，在50%专家稀疏度下性能提升超过5%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏混合专家模型虽然计算效率高，但仍需加载所有专家参数，导致内存使用高和部署困难。现有方法主要关注专家级操作，忽视了神经元级结构

Method: DERN三步骤：1) 基于路由器统计剪枝冗余专家；2) 将专家分解为神经元级片段，分配到最兼容的保留专家；3) 在保留专家内合并片段构建紧凑表示

Result: 在Mixtral、Qwen和DeepSeek模型上，50%专家稀疏度下常识推理和MMLU基准性能提升超过5%，显著减少专家数量和内存使用

Conclusion: DERN通过神经元级重组有效解决了专家错位和语义冲突问题，使稀疏混合专家模型更易于实际部署，无需额外训练

Abstract: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architectures are widely used in large
language models (LLMs) due to their computational efficiency. However, though
only a few experts are activated for each token, SMoE still requires loading
all expert parameters, leading to high memory usage and challenges in
deployment. Previous work has tried to reduce the overhead by pruning and
merging experts, but primarily focused on expert-level operations, leaving
neuron-level structure underexplored. We propose DERN (Dropping Experts,
Recombining Neurons), a task-agnostic and retraining-free framework for expert
pruning and reconstruction. We observe that experts are often misaligned and
contain semantic conflicts at the neuron level, which poses challenges for
direct merging. To solve this, DERN works in three steps: it first prunes
redundant experts using router statistics; then it decomposes them into
neuron-level expert segments, assigning each segment to its most compatible
retained expert; and finally, it merges segments within each retained expert to
build a compact representation. Experiments on Mixtral, Qwen, and DeepSeek SMoE
models show that DERN improves performance by more than 5% on commonsense
reasoning and MMLU benchmarks under 50% expert sparsity, without extra
training. It also greatly reduces the number of experts and memory usage,
making SMoE LLMs easier to deploy in practice.

### [48] [Is In-Context Learning Learning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10414)
*Adrian de Wynter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过大规模实证分析证明，上下文学习(ICL)确实是一种有效的学习范式，但在学习未见任务和泛化能力方面存在局限性，其表现主要依赖于从提示中的规律性推断模式，而非真正的学习机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管自回归模型通过上下文学习(ICL)表现出解决任务的能力，但尚不清楚这是否构成真正的学习。本文旨在从数学和实证角度分析ICL是否确实是一种学习机制，并探究其局限性和工作机制。

Method: 进行大规模ICL分析，通过消融实验控制记忆效应、预训练、分布偏移、提示风格和措辞等因素，研究ICL在不同条件下的表现。

Result: ICL是一种有效的学习范式，但在学习未见任务和泛化方面能力有限。当示例数量足够多时，准确率对示例分布、模型、提示风格和语言特征不敏感，主要从提示中的规律性推断模式。

Conclusion: 自回归模型的临时编码机制不够鲁棒，表明其通用泛化能力有限，ICL更多是基于模式推断而非真正的学习机制。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) allows some autoregressive models to solve tasks
via next-token prediction and without needing further training. This has led to
claims about these model's ability to solve (learn) unseen tasks with only a
few shots (exemplars) in the prompt. However, deduction does not always imply
learning, as ICL does not explicitly encode a given observation. Instead, the
models rely on their prior knowledge and the exemplars given, if any. We argue
that, mathematically, ICL does constitute learning, but its full
characterisation requires empirical work. We then carry out a large-scale
analysis of ICL ablating out or accounting for memorisation, pretraining,
distributional shifts, and prompting style and phrasing. We find that ICL is an
effective learning paradigm, but limited in its ability to learn and generalise
to unseen tasks. We note that, in the limit where exemplars become more
numerous, accuracy is insensitive to exemplar distribution, model, prompt
style, and the input's linguistic features. Instead, it deduces patterns from
regularities in the prompt, which leads to distributional sensitivity,
especially in prompting styles such as chain-of-thought. Given the varied
accuracies on formally similar tasks, we conclude that autoregression's ad-hoc
encoding is not a robust mechanism, and suggests limited all-purpose
generalisability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高年级学生论文经常超过开源Transformer模型的最大长度限制，截断处理会影响评分标准中组织结构要素的评估，引发效度问题。

Method: 在Kaggle ASAP 2.0数据集上评估多种支持长上下文的模型，包括XLNet、Longformer、ModernBERT、Mamba和Llama等模型的微调版本。

Result: 研究对比了不同模型架构在长文本论文评分任务中的表现，以找到更有效的长文本处理方案。

Conclusion: 通过架构改进的Transformer模型可以充分处理超长论文，提高自动评分系统在组织结构要素评估方面的效果和效度。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models are architecturally constrained to process
text of a fixed maximum length. Essays written by higher-grade students
frequently exceed the maximum allowed length for many popular open-source
models. A common approach to addressing this issue when using these models for
Automated Essay Scoring is to truncate the input text. This raises serious
validity concerns as it undermines the model's ability to fully capture and
evaluate organizational elements of the scoring rubric, which requires long
contexts to assess. In this study, we evaluate several models that incorporate
architectural modifications of the standard transformer architecture to
overcome these length limitations using the Kaggle ASAP 2.0 dataset. The models
considered in this study include fine-tuned versions of XLNet, Longformer,
ModernBERT, Mamba, and Llama models.

Abstract: To optimize the reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of Large Language

enables a structured, multi-agent prompting framework. This framework comprises
three specialized components: GuideLLM, a lightweight model deployed at the
edge to provide methodological guidance; SolverLLM, a more powerful model
hosted in the cloud responsible for generating code solutions; and JudgeLLM, an
automated evaluator for assessing solution correctness and quality. To evaluate
and demonstrate the effectiveness of this architecture in realistic settings,
we introduce RefactorCoderQA, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
and enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across multi-domain
coding tasks. Motivated by the limitations of existing benchmarks,
RefactorCoderQA systematically covers various technical domains, including
Software Engineering, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Natural Language
Processing, using authentic coding challenges from Stack Overflow. Extensive
experiments reveal that our fine-tuned model, RefactorCoder-MoE, achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming leading open-source
and commercial baselines with an overall accuracy of 76.84%. Human evaluations
further validate the interpretability, accuracy, and practical relevance of the
generated solutions. In addition, we evaluate system-level metrics, such as
throughput and latency, to gain deeper insights into the performance
characteristics and trade-offs of the proposed architecture.

Motivation: 现有开源大语言模型在深度搜索任务中表现不佳，主要受限于长时程推理能力和缺乏足够困难的监督数据。

Method: 1) 从开放知识图谱自动合成复杂难找的问题；2) 应用端到端多轮强化学习来增强大语言模型的深度搜索长时程推理能力。

Result: DeepDive-32B在BrowseComp基准上超越了WebSailor、DeepSeek-R1-Browse和Search-o1等模型，多轮强化学习训练显著提升了深度搜索能力，并支持测试时工具调用扩展和并行采样。

Conclusion: DeepDive通过自动数据合成和多轮强化学习有效解决了开源大语言模型在深度搜索任务中的局限性，为构建更强大的深度搜索智能体提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with browsing tools substantially
improves their potential as deep search agents to solve complex, real-world
tasks. Yet, open LLMs still perform poorly in such settings due to limited
long-horizon reasoning capacity with browsing tools and the lack of
sufficiently difficult supervised data. To address these challenges, we present
DeepDive to advance deep search agents. First, we propose a strategy to
automatically synthesize complex, difficult, and hard-to-find questions from
open knowledge graphs. Second, we apply end-to-end multi-turn reinforcement
learning (RL) to enhance LLMs' long-horizon reasoning with deep search.
Experiments show that DeepDive-32B achieves a new open-source competitive
result on BrowseComp, outperforming WebSailor, DeepSeek-R1-Browse, and
Search-o1. We demonstrate that multi-turn RL training improves deep search
ability and significantly contributes to the performance improvements across
multiple benchmarks. We observe that DeepDive enables test-time scaling of tool
calls and parallel sampling. All datasets, models, and code are publicly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练ASR模型如Whisper在未见词汇和方言上表现不佳，但在许多实际场景中收集语音数据不切实际，需要仅使用文本数据进行领域自适应。

Method: 提出WhisTLE方法：1）训练变分自编码器(VAE)从文本建模编码器输出；2）使用学习的文本到潜在编码器微调解码器；3）可选结合文本到语音(TTS)进行自适应；4）推理时恢复原始编码器，不增加运行时成本。

Result: 在四个域外数据集和四个ASR模型上，WhisTLE结合TTS相比仅使用TTS的自适应方法相对降低词错误率12.3%，在32个场景中的27个场景中优于所有非WhisTLE基线方法。

Conclusion: WhisTLE是一种有效的文本only自适应方法，能够显著提升预训练ASR模型在未见领域的性能，且不增加推理时的计算开销。

Abstract: Pretrained automatic speech recognition (ASR) models such as Whisper perform
well but still need domain adaptation to handle unseen vocabulary and parlance.
In many real-world settings, collecting speech data is impractical,
necessitating text-only adaptation. We propose WhisTLE, a deeply supervised,
text-only adaptation method for pretrained encoder-decoder ASR models. WhisTLE
trains a variational autoencoder (VAE) to model encoder outputs from text and
fine-tunes the decoder using the learned text-to-latent encoder, optionally
combined with text-to-speech (TTS) adaptation. At inference, the original
encoder is restored, incurring no extra runtime cost. Across four out-of-domain
datasets and four ASR models, WhisTLE with TTS reduces word error rate (WER) by
12.3% relative to TTS-only adaptation and outperforms all non-WhisTLE baselines
in 27 of 32 scenarios.

Motivation: 灾后准确的房屋损坏评估对于保险理赔响应和资源规划至关重要，需要结合图像和文本信息进行综合分析。

Method: 基于经典RAG架构，设计双分支多模态编码器：图像分支使用ResNet和Transformer提取建筑损坏特征，文本分支使用BERT检索器处理文本向量化；集成跨模态交互模块通过多头注意力实现语义对齐；引入模态注意力门控机制动态控制生成过程中的视觉证据和文本先验信息作用。

Conclusion: 该多模态检索增强生成框架通过端到端训练和多任务优化，实现了图像理解和政策匹配的协同学习，为灾后房屋损坏评估提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: After natural disasters, accurate evaluations of damage to housing are
important for insurance claims response and planning of resources. In this
work, we introduce a novel multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (MM-RAG)
framework. On top of classical RAG architecture, we further the framework to
devise a two-branch multimodal encoder structure that the image branch employs
a visual encoder composed of ResNet and Transformer to extract the
characteristic of building damage after disaster, and the text branch harnesses
a BERT retriever for the text vectorization of posts as well as insurance
policies and for the construction of a retrievable restoration index. To impose
cross-modal semantic alignment, the model integrates a cross-modal interaction
module to bridge the semantic representation between image and text via
multi-head attention. Meanwhile, in the generation module, the introduced modal
attention gating mechanism dynamically controls the role of visual evidence and
text prior information during generation. The entire framework takes end-to-end
training, and combines the comparison loss, the retrieval loss and the
generation loss to form multi-task optimization objectives, and achieves image
understanding and policy matching in collaborative learning. The results
demonstrate superior performance in retrieval accuracy and classification index
on damage severity, where the Top-1 retrieval accuracy has been improved by
9.6%.

Conclusion: 该方法简单、可扩展，能够立即部署到其他文档集集和转换模型中

Abstract: We present a novel ensemble framework that stabilizes LLM based text
extraction from noisy historical documents. We transcribe multiple augmented
variants of each image with Gemini 2.0 Flash and fuse these outputs with a
custom Needleman Wunsch style aligner that yields both a consensus
transcription and a confidence score. We present a new dataset of 622
Pennsylvania death records, and demonstrate our method improves transcription
accuracy by 4 percentage points relative to a single shot baseline. We find
that padding and blurring are the most useful for improving accuracy, while
grid warp perturbations are best for separating high and low confidence cases.
The approach is simple, scalable, and immediately deployable to other document
collections and transcription models.

TL;DR: MITS是首个专门为智能交通监控(ITS)设计的大规模多模态基准数据集，包含17万张真实交通监控图像和500万条指令-问答对，显著提升了多模态大模型在ITS任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用多模态大模型在智能交通监控领域表现有限，主要缺乏专门的ITS多模态数据集。

Method: 收集17万张真实ITS图像并进行标注，通过系统化数据生成流程创建高质量图像描述和500万条指令-问答对，涵盖5个关键ITS任务。

Result: 在MITS数据集上微调后，LLaVA-1.5性能从0.494提升至0.905(+83.2%)，LLaVA-1.6从0.678到0.921(+35.8%)，Qwen2-VL从0.584到0.926(+58.6%)，Qwen2.5-VL从0.732到0.930(+27.0%)。

Conclusion: MITS数据集有效解决了ITS领域多模态数据缺失问题，显著提升了LMM在ITS应用中的性能，为ITS和LMM研究提供了高价值资源。

Abstract: General-domain large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved significant
advances in various image-text tasks. However, their performance in the
Intelligent Traffic Surveillance (ITS) domain remains limited due to the
absence of dedicated multimodal datasets. To address this gap, we introduce
MITS (Multimodal Intelligent Traffic Surveillance), the first large-scale
multimodal benchmark dataset specifically designed for ITS. MITS includes
170,400 independently collected real-world ITS images sourced from traffic
surveillance cameras, annotated with eight main categories and 24 subcategories
of ITS-specific objects and events under diverse environmental conditions.
Additionally, through a systematic data generation pipeline, we generate
high-quality image captions and 5 million instruction-following visual
question-answer pairs, addressing five critical ITS tasks: object and event
recognition, object counting, object localization, background analysis, and
event reasoning. To demonstrate MITS's effectiveness, we fine-tune mainstream
LMMs on this dataset, enabling the development of ITS-specific applications.
Experimental results show that MITS significantly improves LMM performance in
ITS applications, increasing LLaVA-1.5's performance from 0.494 to 0.905
(+83.2%), LLaVA-1.6's from 0.678 to 0.921 (+35.8%), Qwen2-VL's from 0.584 to
0.926 (+58.6%), and Qwen2.5-VL's from 0.732 to 0.930 (+27.0%). We release the
dataset, code, and models as open-source, providing high-value resources to
advance both ITS and LMM research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视觉语言模型在细粒度任务和大规模层次标签空间中的表现，探索结构化树基推理是否能增强VLM性能。

Method: 引入一个框架，使用决策树将分类分解为可解释的决策，在细粒度(GTSRB)和粗粒度(CIFAR-10)数据集上进行评估，并尝试用LLM生成的类别和图像描述来增强树提示。

Result: 模型在理解树知识方面达到98.2%准确率，但树基推理始终表现不如标准零样本提示。添加图像描述能同时提升树基方法和零样本方法的性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了结构化推理在视觉分类中的局限性，为设计更可解释的VLM系统提供了见解。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) excel at zero-shot visual classification, but
their performance on fine-grained tasks and large hierarchical label spaces is
understudied. This paper investigates whether structured, tree-based reasoning
can enhance VLM performance. We introduce a framework that decomposes
classification into interpretable decisions using decision trees and evaluates
it on fine-grained (GTSRB) and coarse-grained (CIFAR-10) datasets. Although the
model achieves 98.2% accuracy in understanding the tree knowledge, tree-based
reasoning consistently underperforms standard zero-shot prompting. We also
explore enhancing the tree prompts with LLM-generated classes and image
descriptions to improve alignment. The added description enhances the
performance of the tree-based and zero-shot methods. Our findings highlight
limitations of structured reasoning in visual classification and offer insights
for designing more interpretable VLM systems.

Motivation: 构建能够从数据中学习丰富可控性和灵活提示性的世界模型，支持对任何变量集的完整条件分布建模

Method: 三步循环：1)概率预测-构建概率图模型；2)结构提取-通过因果推断提取低维结构；3)集成-将结构转换为新token类型并反馈训练

Result: 在1.4万亿token互联网视频数据上训练，实现了最先进的光流、自监督深度和对象分割，支持完整的预测改进循环

Conclusion: PSI系统通过循环增强模型能力，既改善了底层数据建模，又创造了类似LLM通用提示语言的新控制机制

Abstract: We present Probabilistic Structure Integration (PSI), a system for learning
richly controllable and flexibly promptable world models from data. PSI
consists of a three-step cycle. The first step, Probabilistic prediction,
involves building a probabilistic graphical model Psi of the data, in the form
of a random-access autoregressive sequence model. Psi supports a complete set
of learned conditional distributions describing the dependence of any variables
in the data on any other set of variables. In step 2, Structure extraction, we
show how to extract underlying low-dimensional properties in the data,
corresponding to a diverse set of meaningful "intermediate structures", in a
zero-shot fashion via causal inference on Psi. Step 3, Integration, completes
the cycle by converting these structures into new token types that are then
continually mixed back into the training diet as conditioning signals and
prediction targets. Each such cycle augments the capabilities of Psi, both
allowing it to model the underlying data better, and creating new control
handles -- akin to an LLM-like universal prompting language. We train an
instance of Psi on 1.4 trillion tokens of internet video data; we use it to
perform a variety of useful video prediction and understanding inferences; we
extract state-of-the-art optical flow, self-supervised depth and object
segmentation; and we use these structures to support a full cycle of predictive
improvements.

TL;DR: 本文首次分析了联邦学习中视频数据的梯度反演攻击风险，发现特征提取器能提供更好保护，但攻击仍可能发生，图像超分辨率技术可提升攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习的核心隐私保护原则是通过只交换模型更新而非原始数据来保护隐私，但梯度反演攻击威胁着这一机制。虽然已知该攻击对图像、文本和表格数据的影响，但对视频数据的影响尚未研究。

Method: 评估两种视频分类方法：使用预训练特征提取器的方法和处理原始视频帧的简单变换方法。测试在不同攻击场景下（攻击者拥有0、1或多个参考帧）的梯度反演攻击效果，并使用图像超分辨率技术提升重建视频质量。

Result: 特征提取器对梯度反演攻击具有更强的抵抗力，但如果分类器复杂度不足，数据泄露仍可能发生。图像超分辨率技术能显著提高通过梯度反演攻击提取的帧质量。

Conclusion: 视频数据在联邦学习中存在可行的泄露威胁，发生条件需要进一步研究。特征提取器提供了一定保护，但并非绝对安全。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows multiple entities to train a shared model
collaboratively. Its core, privacy-preserving principle is that participants
only exchange model updates, such as gradients, and never their raw, sensitive
data. This approach is fundamental for applications in domains where privacy
and confidentiality are important. However, the security of this very mechanism
is threatened by gradient inversion attacks, which can reverse-engineer private
training data directly from the shared gradients, defeating the purpose of FL.
While the impact of these attacks is known for image, text, and tabular data,
their effect on video data remains an unexamined area of research. This paper
presents the first analysis of video data leakage in FL using gradient
inversion attacks. We evaluate two common video classification approaches: one
employing pre-trained feature extractors and another that processes raw video
frames with simple transformations. Our initial results indicate that the use
of feature extractors offers greater resilience against gradient inversion
attacks. We also demonstrate that image super-resolution techniques can enhance
the frames extracted through gradient inversion attacks, enabling attackers to
reconstruct higher-quality videos. Our experiments validate this across
scenarios where the attacker has access to zero, one, or more reference frames
from the target environment. We find that although feature extractors make
attacks more challenging, leakage is still possible if the classifier lacks
sufficient complexity. We, therefore, conclude that video data leakage in FL is
a viable threat, and the conditions under which it occurs warrant further
investigation.

Conclusion: 该框架通过半监督学习和模型协同有效解决了密集零售环境中的目标检测问题，显著减少了标注需求，具有良好的实际应用价值。

Abstract: This study proposes a semi-supervised co-training framework for object
detection in densely packed retail environments, where limited labeled data and
complex conditions pose major challenges. The framework combines Faster R-CNN
(utilizing a ResNet backbone) for precise localization with YOLO (employing a
Darknet backbone) for global context, enabling mutual pseudo-label exchange
that improves accuracy in scenes with occlusion and overlapping objects. To
strengthen classification, it employs an ensemble of XGBoost, Random Forest,
and SVM, utilizing diverse feature representations for higher robustness.
Hyperparameters are optimized using a metaheuristic-driven algorithm, enhancing
precision and efficiency across models. By minimizing reliance on manual
labeling, the approach reduces annotation costs and adapts effectively to
frequent product and layout changes common in retail. Experiments on the
SKU-110k dataset demonstrate strong performance, highlighting the scalability
and practicality of the proposed framework for real-world retail applications
such as automated inventory tracking, product monitoring, and checkout systems.

Method: 提出两种变体：PG-SP利用源域统计信息，PG-SF是完全无源版本，依赖CLS-token驱动的自适应，在注意力层前移除受域偏移影响的token

Result: 在ModelNet40-C、ShapeNet-C和ScanObjectNN-C上评估，PG-SP比最先进的无反向传播方法平均准确率高10.3%，PG-SF在无源自适应方面创下新基准，速度提升12.4倍，内存效率提升5.5倍

Conclusion: Token Purging是一种高效、内存友好的测试时自适应方法，适用于实际部署，无需反向传播即可实现鲁棒的性能提升

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) is crucial for mitigating performance degradation
caused by distribution shifts in 3D point cloud classification. In this work,
we introduce Token Purging (PG), a novel backpropagation-free approach that
removes tokens highly affected by domain shifts before they reach attention
layers. Unlike existing TTA methods, PG operates at the token level, ensuring
robust adaptation without iterative updates. We propose two variants: PG-SP,
which leverages source statistics, and PG-SF, a fully source-free version
relying on CLS-token-driven adaptation. Extensive evaluations on ModelNet40-C,
ShapeNet-C, and ScanObjectNN-C demonstrate that PG-SP achieves an average of
+10.3\% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art backpropagation-free methods,
while PG-SF sets new benchmarks for source-free adaptation. Moreover, PG is
12.4 times faster and 5.5 times more memory efficient than our baseline, making
it suitable for real-world deployment. Code is available at

<details>

Motivation: 传统方法将地面图像转换为鸟视图并与航拍图对齐的方法存在信息损失问题，特别是视角扭曲和高度信息压缩导致对齐质量下降。

Method: 直接在地面和航拍图片之间建立对应关系，仅将匹配的关键点通过单目深度预测提升到BEV空间，使用粗谱对齐估计相机位姿，支持合理深度和相对深度两种模式。

Result: 在挑战性条件下（跨区域治理、未知方向）都展现了优异的定位性能，且不需要每个深度模型的微调，具有强大的实际部署灵活性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过避免传统BEV转换的缺陷，实现了更准确和可解释的细粒度定位，具有良好的实际应用前景。

Abstract: We propose an accurate and highly interpretable fine-grained cross-view
localization method that estimates the 3 Degrees of Freedom pose of a
ground-level image by matching its local features with a reference aerial
image. Previous methods typically transform the ground image into a bird's-eye
view (BEV) representation and then align it with the aerial image for
localization. However, this transformation often leads to information loss due
to perspective distortion or compression of height information, thereby
degrading alignment quality with the aerial view. In contrast, our method
directly establishes correspondences between ground and aerial images and lifts
only the matched keypoints to BEV space using monocular depth prior. Notably,
modern depth predictors can provide reliable metric depth when the test samples
are similar to the training data. When the depth distribution differs, they
still produce consistent relative depth, i.e., depth accurate up to an unknown
scale. Our method supports both metric and relative depth. It employs a
scale-aware Procrustes alignment to estimate the camera pose from the
correspondences and optionally recover the scale when using relative depth.
Experimental results demonstrate that, with only weak supervision on camera
pose, our method learns accurate local feature correspondences and achieves
superior localization performance under challenging conditions, such as
cross-area generalization and unknown orientation. Moreover, our method is
compatible with various relative depth models without requiring per-model
finetuning. This flexibility, combined with strong localization performance,
makes it well-suited for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Numerous visual impairments can be detected in red-eye reflex images from
young children. The so-called Bruckner test is traditionally performed by
ophthalmologists in clinical settings. Thanks to the recent technological
advances in smartphones and artificial intelligence, it is now possible to
recreate the Bruckner test using a mobile device. In this paper, we present a
first study conducted during the development of KidsVisionCheck, a free
application that can perform vision screening with a mobile device using
red-eye reflex images. The underlying model relies on deep neural networks
trained on children's pupil images collected and labeled by an ophthalmologist.
With an accuracy of 90% on unseen test data, our model provides highly reliable
performance without the necessity of specialist equipment. Furthermore, we can
identify the optimal conditions for data collection, which can in turn be used
to provide immediate feedback to the users. In summary, this work marks a first
step toward accessible pediatric vision screenings and early intervention for

Abstract: Robust semantic perception for autonomous vehicles relies on effectively
combining multiple sensors with complementary strengths and weaknesses.
State-of-the-art sensor fusion approaches to semantic perception often treat
sensor data uniformly across the spatial extent of the input, which hinders
performance when faced with challenging conditions. By contrast, we propose a
novel depth-guided multimodal fusion method that upgrades condition-aware
fusion by integrating depth information. Our network, DGFusion, poses
multimodal segmentation as a multi-task problem, utilizing the lidar
measurements, which are typically available in outdoor sensor suites, both as
one of the model's inputs and as ground truth for learning depth. Our
corresponding auxiliary depth head helps to learn depth-aware features, which
are encoded into spatially varying local depth tokens that condition our
attentive cross-modal fusion. Together with a global condition token, these
local depth tokens dynamically adapt sensor fusion to the spatially varying
reliability of each sensor across the scene, which largely depends on depth. In
addition, we propose a robust loss for our depth, which is essential for
learning from lidar inputs that are typically sparse and noisy in adverse
conditions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art panoptic and semantic
segmentation performance on the challenging MUSES and DELIVER datasets. Code

Abstract: Rosacea, which is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that manifests with
facial redness, papules, and visible blood vessels, often requirs precise and
early detection for significantly improving treatment effectiveness. This paper
presents new patch-based automatic rosacea detection strategies using the
ResNet-18 deep learning framework. The contributions of the proposed strategies
come from the following aspects. First, various image pateches are extracted
from the facial images of people in different sizes, shapes, and locations.
Second, a number of investigation studies are carried out to evaluate how the
localized visual information influences the deep learing model performance.
Third, thorough experiments are implemented to reveal that several patch-based
automatic rosacea detection strategies achieve competitive or superior accuracy
and sensitivity than the full-image based methods. And finally, the proposed
patch-based strategies, which use only localized patches, inherently preserve
patient privacy by excluding any identifiable facial features from the data.
The experimental results indicate that the proposed patch-based strategies
guide the deep learning model to focus on clinically relevant regions, enhance
robustness and interpretability, and protect patient privacy. As a result, the
proposed strategies offer practical insights for improving automated
dermatological diagnostics.

Conclusion: 合成数据与临床先验知识的结合能够实现准确且符合道德规范的皮肤科AI系统，尤其适用于远程医疗和大规模筛查等隐私敏感的应用场景。

Abstract: Rosacea is a common but underdiagnosed inflammatory skin condition that
primarily affects the central face and presents with subtle redness, pustules,
and visible blood vessels. Automated detection remains challenging due to the
diffuse nature of symptoms, the scarcity of labeled datasets, and privacy
concerns associated with using identifiable facial images. A novel
privacy-preserving automated rosacea detection method inspired by clinical
priors and trained entirely on synthetic data is presented in this paper.
Specifically, the proposed method, which leverages the observation that rosacea
manifests predominantly through central facial erythema, first constructs a
fixed redness-informed mask by selecting regions with consistently high red
channel intensity across facial images. The mask thus is able to focus on
diagnostically relevant areas such as the cheeks, nose, and forehead and
exclude identity-revealing features. Second, the ResNet-18 deep learning
method, which is trained on the masked synthetic images, achieves superior
performance over the full-face baselines with notable gains in terms of
accuracy, recall and F1 score when evaluated using the real-world test data.
The experimental results demonstrate that the synthetic data and clinical
priors can jointly enable accurate and ethical dermatological AI systems,
especially for privacy sensitive applications in telemedicine and large-scale
screening.

analysis includes: (1) removal of the learnable Wiener filter, (2) selective
use of individual loss terms from the composite loss function. All variants are
benchmarked on a publicly available paired laparoscopic images dataset using
quantitative metrics (SSIM, PSNR, MSE and CIEDE-2000) alongside qualitative
visual comparisons.

Abstract: We introduce a multi-modal WAVE-DETR drone detector combining visible RGB and

visual and acoustic features in a unified object detector model relying on the
Deformable DETR and Wav2Vec2 architectures, achieving strong performance under

detection performance over all drones dimensions. The best performer is the
gated fusion approach, which improves the mAP of the Deformable DETR object
detector on our in-distribution and out-of-distribution ARDrone datasets by
11.1% to 15.3% for small drones across all IoU thresholds between 0.5 and 0.9.
The mAP scores for medium and large drones are also enhanced, with overall
gains across all drone sizes ranging from 3.27% to 5.84%.

TL;DR: 提出了一种称为代理监督的新训练范式，通过将估计的空间变换应用于代理图像，将输入域与监督域解耦，从而提高深度学习图像配准网络的鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习图像配准虽然精度高，但对输入图像特征变化（如伪影、视野不匹配、模态差异）敏感，需要提高其鲁棒性和泛化性。

Method: 引入代理监督方法，将输入域与监督域解耦，通过将估计的空间变换应用于代理图像来确保在相似性定义良好的域中进行监督计算。

Result: 在三个代表性应用中（抗伪影脑MR配准、掩码无关肺CT配准、多模态MR配准）均表现出对输入变化的强韧性，同时在精心整理的数据上保持高性能。

Conclusion: 代理监督提供了一个原则性框架，在不增加复杂性的情况下训练鲁棒且可泛化的深度学习配准模型，为医学图像配准的广泛应用提供了实用途径。

Abstract: Objective: Deep learning-based deformable image registration has achieved
strong accuracy, but remains sensitive to variations in input image
characteristics such as artifacts, field-of-view mismatch, or modality
difference. We aim to develop a general training paradigm that improves the
robustness and generalizability of registration networks. Methods: We introduce
surrogate supervision, which decouples the input domain from the supervision
domain by applying estimated spatial transformations to surrogate images. This
allows training on heterogeneous inputs while ensuring supervision is computed
in domains where similarity is well defined. We evaluate the framework through
three representative applications: artifact-robust brain MR registration,
mask-agnostic lung CT registration, and multi-modal MR registration. Results:
Across tasks, surrogate supervision demonstrated strong resilience to input
variations including inhomogeneity field, inconsistent field-of-view, and
modality differences, while maintaining high performance on well-curated data.
Conclusions: Surrogate supervision provides a principled framework for training
robust and generalizable deep learning-based registration models without
increasing complexity. Significance: Surrogate supervision offers a practical
pathway to more robust and generalizable medical image registration, enabling
broader applicability in diverse biomedical imaging scenarios.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一个结合卷积自编码器和Vision Transformer的框架，用于提高牙齿年龄估计的准确性和可解释性，解决了第三磨牙分类性能较差的数据中心问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在法医年龄估计等高风险应用中的实际采用受到模型'黑盒'性质的限制，需要提高性能和透明度。

Method: 使用卷积自编码器(AE)与Vision Transformer(ViT)结合的框架，通过分析潜在空间度量和图像重建来提供多方面的诊断见解。

Result: 分类准确率显著提升：牙齿37从0.712提高到0.815，牙齿38从0.462提高到0.543，并发现剩余性能差距主要是由于牙齿38数据集的高类内形态变异性。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提高了准确性，还提供了模型不确定性的证据，强调了依赖单一可解释性模式的不足，为法医年龄估计专家决策提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: The practical adoption of deep learning in high-stakes forensic applications,
such as dental age estimation, is often limited by the 'black box' nature of
the models. This study introduces a framework designed to enhance both
performance and transparency in this context. We use a notable performance
disparity in the automated staging of mandibular second (tooth 37) and third
(tooth 38) molars as a case study. The proposed framework, which combines a
convolutional autoencoder (AE) with a Vision Transformer (ViT), improves
classification accuracy for both teeth over a baseline ViT, increasing from
0.712 to 0.815 for tooth 37 and from 0.462 to 0.543 for tooth 38. Beyond
improving performance, the framework provides multi-faceted diagnostic
insights. Analysis of the AE's latent space metrics and image reconstructions
indicates that the remaining performance gap is data-centric, suggesting high
intra-class morphological variability in the tooth 38 dataset is a primary
limiting factor. This work highlights the insufficiency of relying on a single
mode of interpretability, such as attention maps, which can appear anatomically
plausible yet fail to identify underlying data issues. By offering a
methodology that both enhances accuracy and provides evidence for why a model
may be uncertain, this framework serves as a more robust tool to support expert
decision-making in forensic age estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SFDA方法依赖全监督预训练并使用余弦相似度对齐特征，无意中丢弃了源模型潜在流形的关键几何信息

Method: 使用自监督预训练的教师模型初始化框架，通过实例级特征匹配和空间相似性损失进行几何流形对齐，采用EMA更新教师参数以防止灾难性遗忘

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，SCoDA显著优于最先进的SFDA方法

Conclusion: SCoDA通过自监督预训练和几何流形对齐成功解决了SFDA中的几何信息丢失问题，取得了优异的性能

Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) addresses the challenge of adapting a
model to a target domain without access to the data of the source domain.
Prevailing methods typically start with a source model pre-trained with full
supervision and distill the knowledge by aligning instance-level features.
However, these approaches, relying on cosine similarity over L2-normalized
feature vectors, inadvertently discard crucial geometric information about the
latent manifold of the source model. We introduce Self-supervised Continual
Domain Adaptation (SCoDA) to address these limitations. We make two key
departures from standard practice: first, we avoid the reliance on supervised
pre-training by initializing the proposed framework with a teacher model
pre-trained entirely via self-supervision (SSL). Second, we adapt the principle
of geometric manifold alignment to the SFDA setting. The student is trained
with a composite objective combining instance-level feature matching with a
Space Similarity Loss. To combat catastrophic forgetting, the teacher's
parameters are updated via an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of the student's
parameters. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SCoDA
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SFDA methods.

Conclusion: 该方法免除了手动标注的成本和时间消耗，并能够在多样化显微镜数据上实现良好的沿用性

Abstract: Tracking cells and detecting mitotic events in time-lapse microscopy image
sequences is a crucial task in biomedical research. However, it remains highly
challenging due to dividing objects, low signal-tonoise ratios, indistinct
boundaries, dense clusters, and the visually similar appearance of individual
cells. Existing deep learning-based methods rely on manually labeled datasets
for training, which is both costly and time-consuming. Moreover, their
generalizability to unseen datasets remains limited due to the vast diversity
of microscopy data. To overcome these limitations, we propose a zero-shot cell
tracking framework by integrating Segment Anything 2 (SAM2), a large foundation
model designed for general image and video segmentation, into the tracking
pipeline. As a fully-unsupervised approach, our method does not depend on or
inherit biases from any specific training dataset, allowing it to generalize
across diverse microscopy datasets without finetuning. Our approach achieves
competitive accuracy in both 2D and large-scale 3D time-lapse microscopy videos
while eliminating the need for dataset-specific adaptation.

Conclusion: 该方法可以在不需要完全重构现有2D跟踪系统的情况下扩展到3D空间跟踪，为现有监控系统提供了可行的升级方案

Abstract: Multi-Target Multi-Camera Tracking (MTMC) is an essential computer vision
task for automating large-scale surveillance. With camera calibration and depth
information, the targets in the scene can be projected into 3D space, offering
unparalleled levels of automatic perception of a 3D environment. However,
tracking in the 3D space requires replacing all 2D tracking components from the
ground up, which may be infeasible for existing MTMC systems. In this paper, we
present an approach for extending any online 2D multi-camera tracking system
into 3D space by utilizing depth information to reconstruct a target in
point-cloud space, and recovering its 3D box through clustering and yaw
refinement following tracking. We also introduced an enhanced online data
association mechanism that leverages the target's local ID consistency to
assign global IDs across frames. The proposed framework is evaluated on the
2025 AI City Challenge's 3D MTMC dataset, achieving 3rd place on the
leaderboard.

Motivation: 传统的指代表达式理解通常需要任务特定训练的地面模型，这篇论文证明可以通过零样本工作流达到竞争性能。

Method: 将REC重构为盲区视觉-语言验证：使用YOLO-World检测器提供建议区域，然后用通用VLM对每个区域进行True/False查询。方法不需微调，支持拒绝和多重匹配。

Result: 在RefCOCO、RefCOCO+、RefCOCOg数据集上，该方法超越了零样本GroundingDINO基线，甚至超过了在REC上训练的GroundingDINO和GroundingDINO+CRG。验证方法显著超过选择基于提示的方法。

Conclusion: 工作流设计比任务特定预训练更能推动零样本REC性能，为视觉-语言完成提供了简单而高效的方案。

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) is usually addressed with
task-trained grounding models. We show that a zero-shot workflow, without any
REC-specific training, can achieve competitive or superior performance. Our
approach reformulates REC as box-wise visual-language verification: given
proposals from a COCO-clean generic detector (YOLO-World), a general-purpose
VLM independently answers True/False queries for each region. This simple
procedure reduces cross-box interference, supports abstention and multiple
matches, and requires no fine-tuning. On RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, our
method not only surpasses a zero-shot GroundingDINO baseline but also exceeds
reported results for GroundingDINO trained on REC and GroundingDINO+CRG.
Controlled studies with identical proposals confirm that verification
significantly outperforms selection-based prompting, and results hold with open
VLMs. Overall, we show that workflow design, rather than task-specific
pretraining, drives strong zero-shot REC performance.

Conclusion: 目标化数据增强技术能有效缓解极端像素不平衡问题，为农业图像分割提供了简单有效的解决方案

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of foliar diseases and insect damage in wheat is
crucial for effective crop management and disease control. However, the insect
damage typically occupies only a tiny fraction of annotated pixels. This
extreme pixel-level imbalance poses a significant challenge to the segmentation
performance, which can result in overfitting to common classes and insufficient
learning of rare classes, thereby impairing overall performance. In this paper,
we propose a Random Projected Copy-and-Paste (RPCP) augmentation technique to
address the pixel imbalance problem. Specifically, we extract rare
insect-damage patches from annotated training images and apply random geometric
transformations to simulate variations. The transformed patches are then pasted
in appropriate regions while avoiding overlaps with lesions or existing damaged
regions. In addition, we apply a random projection filter to the pasted
regions, refining local features and ensuring a natural blend with the new
background. Experiments show that our method substantially improves
segmentation performance on the insect damage class, while maintaining or even
slightly enhancing accuracy on other categories. Our results highlight the
effectiveness of targeted augmentation in mitigating extreme pixel imbalance,
offering a straightforward yet effective solution for agricultural segmentation
problems.

Motivation: 现有多目标追踪方法在长时间追踪中存在身份切换问题，性能随时间逐渐下降，特别是在如生富领域等实际应用中

Method: 提出一种新的HMM框架，将不确定身份与追踪结合起来，利用如供斗站等源获得的偶然身份识别信息

Conclusion: 该HMM框架能够有效解决长期追踪中的身份切换问题，为实际应用如生富监测提供了可靠的解决方案

Abstract: The need for long-term multi-object tracking (MOT) is growing due to the
demand for analyzing individual behaviors in videos that span several minutes.
Unfortunately, due to identity switches between objects, the tracking
performance of existing MOT approaches decreases over time, making them
difficult to apply for long-term tracking. However, in many real-world
applications, such as in the livestock sector, it is possible to obtain
sporadic identifications for some of the animals from sources like feeders. To
address the challenges of long-term MOT, we propose a new framework that
combines both uncertain identities and tracking using a Hidden Markov Model
(HMM) formulation. In addition to providing real-world identities to animals,
our HMM framework improves the F1 score of ByteTrack, a leading MOT approach
even with re-identification, on a 10 minute pig tracking dataset with 21
identifications at the pen's feeding station. We also show that our approach is
robust to the uncertainty of identifications, with performance increasing as
identities are provided more frequently. The improved performance of our HMM
framework was also validated on the MOT17 and MOT20 benchmark datasets using
both ByteTrack and FairMOT. The code for this new HMM framework and the new
10-minute pig tracking video dataset are available at:

Abstract: Event camera sensors are bio-inspired sensors which asynchronously capture
per-pixel brightness changes and output a stream of events encoding the
polarity, location and time of these changes. These systems are witnessing
rapid advancements as an emerging field, driven by their low latency, reduced
power consumption, and ultra-high capture rates. This survey explores the
evolution of fusing event-stream captured with traditional frame-based capture,
highlighting how this synergy significantly benefits various video restoration
and 3D reconstruction tasks. The paper systematically reviews major deep
learning contributions to image/video enhancement and restoration, focusing on
two dimensions: temporal enhancement (such as frame interpolation and motion
deblurring) and spatial enhancement (including super-resolution, low-light and
HDR enhancement, and artifact reduction). This paper also explores how the 3D
reconstruction domain evolves with the advancement of event driven fusion.
Diverse topics are covered, with in-depth discussions on recent works for
improving visual quality under challenging conditions. Additionally, the survey
compiles a comprehensive list of openly available datasets, enabling
reproducible research and benchmarking. By consolidating recent progress and
insights, this survey aims to inspire further research into leveraging event
camera systems, especially in combination with deep learning, for advanced
visual media restoration and enhancement.

Conclusion: ISTASTrack证明了ANN-SNN混合设计在鲁棒视觉跟踪中的有效性和实用性，为跨模态特征融合提供了新思路。

Abstract: RGB-Event tracking has become a promising trend in visual object tracking to
leverage the complementary strengths of both RGB images and dynamic spike
events for improved performance. However, existing artificial neural networks
(ANNs) struggle to fully exploit the sparse and asynchronous nature of event
streams. Recent efforts toward hybrid architectures combining ANNs and spiking
neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising solution in RGB-Event
perception, yet effectively fusing features across heterogeneous paradigms
remains a challenge. In this work, we propose ISTASTrack, the first
transformer-based \textbf{A}NN-\textbf{S}NN hybrid \textbf{Track}er equipped
with \textbf{ISTA} adapters for RGB-Event tracking. The two-branch model
employs a vision transformer to extract spatial context from RGB inputs and a
spiking transformer to capture spatio-temporal dynamics from event streams. To
bridge the modality and paradigm gap between ANN and SNN features, we
systematically design a model-based ISTA adapter for bidirectional feature
interaction between the two branches, derived from sparse representation theory
by unfolding the iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm. Additionally, we
incorporate a temporal downsampling attention module within the adapter to
align multi-step SNN features with single-step ANN features in the latent
space, improving temporal fusion. Experimental results on RGB-Event tracking
benchmarks, such as FE240hz, VisEvent, COESOT, and FELT, have demonstrated that
ISTASTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high energy
efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness and practicality of hybrid ANN-SNN
designs for robust visual tracking. The code is publicly available at

Abstract: Accurate and reliable solar flare predictions are essential to mitigate
potential impacts on critical infrastructure. However, the current performance
of solar flare forecasting is insufficient. In this study, we address the task
of predicting the class of the largest solar flare expected to occur within the
next 72 hours. Existing methods often fail to adequately address the severe
class imbalance across flare classes. To address this issue, we propose a solar
flare prediction model based on multiple deep state space models. In addition,
we introduce the frequency & local-boundary-aware reliability loss (FLARE loss)
to improve predictive performance and reliability under class imbalance.
Experiments were conducted on a multi-wavelength solar image dataset covering a
full 11-year solar activity cycle. As a result, our method outperformed
baseline approaches in terms of both the Gandin-Murphy-Gerrity score and the
true skill statistic, which are standard metrics in terms of the performance
and reliability.

Abstract: RGB-thermal (RGB-T) semantic segmentation improves the environmental
perception of autonomous platforms in challenging conditions. Prevailing models
employ encoders pre-trained on RGB images to extract features from both RGB and
infrared inputs, and design additional modules to achieve cross-modal feature
fusion. This results in limited thermal feature extraction and suboptimal
cross-modal fusion, while the redundant encoders further compromises the
model's real-time efficiency. To address the above issues, we propose TUNI,
with an RGB-T encoder consisting of multiple stacked blocks that simultaneously
perform multi-modal feature extraction and cross-modal fusion. By leveraging
large-scale pre-training with RGB and pseudo-thermal data, the RGB-T encoder
learns to integrate feature extraction and fusion in a unified manner. By
slimming down the thermal branch, the encoder achieves a more compact
architecture. Moreover, we introduce an RGB-T local module to strengthen the
encoder's capacity for cross-modal local feature fusion. The RGB-T local module
employs adaptive cosine similarity to selectively emphasize salient consistent
and distinct local features across RGB-T modalities. Experimental results show
that TUNI achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art models on FMB,
PST900 and CART, with fewer parameters and lower computational cost. Meanwhile,
it achieves an inference speed of 27 FPS on a Jetson Orin NX, demonstrating its
real-time capability in deployment. Codes are available at

influence the entire structure of the individual characters.

Abstract: Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) is a widely used computer vision method that
determines an agent's movement through a camera and an IMU sensor. This paper
presents an efficient and accurate VIO pipeline optimized for applications on
micro- and nano-UAVs. The proposed design incorporates state-of-the-art feature
detection and tracking methods (SuperPoint, PX4FLOW, ORB), all optimized and
quantized for emerging RISC-V-based ultra-low-power parallel systems on chips

reduces estimation errors and achieves improved accuracy in planar motion
scenarios. The pipeline's suitability for real-time VIO is assessed on an

after quantization. The pipeline, including the three feature tracking methods,
was implemented on the SoC for real-world validation. This design bridges the
gap between high-accuracy VIO pipelines that are traditionally run on
computationally powerful systems and lightweight implementations suitable for
microcontrollers. The optimized pipeline on the GAP9 low-power SoC demonstrates
an average reduction in RMSE of up to a factor of 3.65x over the baseline
pipeline when using the ORB feature tracker. The analysis of the computational
complexity of the feature trackers further shows that PX4FLOW achieves on-par
tracking accuracy with ORB at a lower runtime for movement speeds below 24
pixels/frame.

Abstract: Recovering 3D face models from 2D in-the-wild images has gained considerable
attention in the computer vision community due to its wide range of potential
applications. However, the lack of ground-truth labeled datasets and the
complexity of real-world environments remain significant challenges. In this
chapter, we propose a convolutional neural network-based approach, the
Hierarchical Multi-Level Attention Network (MLANet), for reconstructing 3D face
models from single in-the-wild images. Our model predicts detailed facial
geometry, texture, pose, and illumination parameters from a single image.
Specifically, we employ a pre-trained hierarchical backbone network and
introduce multi-level attention mechanisms at different stages of 2D face image
feature extraction. A semi-supervised training strategy is employed,
incorporating 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) parameters from publicly available
datasets along with a differentiable renderer, enabling an end-to-end training
process. Extensive experiments, including both comparative and ablation
studies, were conducted on two benchmark datasets, AFLW2000-3D and MICC
Florence, focusing on 3D face reconstruction and 3D face alignment tasks. The
effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated both quantitatively and
qualitatively.

TL;DR: LaV-CoT是一个语言感知的视觉思维链框架，通过多阶段推理流程和奖励优化，显著提升多语言视觉问答性能，在多个基准测试中超越开源和专有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖文本思维链，对多语言多模态推理支持有限，限制了在实际应用中的部署。

Method: 设计多阶段推理流程（文本摘要、语言识别、空间目标级描述、逐步逻辑推理），采用自动数据标注方法和两阶段训练范式（SFT+GRPO），结合多维度奖励优化。

Result: 在MMMB、Multilingual MMBench和MTVQA等数据集上，比同类规模开源模型提升9.5%准确率，超越2倍规模模型2.6%，优于GPT-4o和Gemini-2.5等专有模型。

Conclusion: LaV-CoT框架有效解决了多语言视觉推理的挑战，通过可解释的多阶段推理和奖励优化实现了优异的性能，具备工业部署价值。

Abstract: As large vision language models (VLMs) advance, their capabilities in
multilingual visual question answering (mVQA) have significantly improved.
Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has been proven to enhance interpretability
and complex reasoning. However, most existing approaches rely primarily on
textual CoT and provide limited support for multilingual multimodal reasoning,
constraining their deployment in real-world applications. To address this gap,
we introduce \textbf{LaV-CoT}, the first Language-aware Visual CoT framework
with Multi-Aspect Reward Optimization. LaV-CoT incorporates an interpretable
multi-stage reasoning pipeline consisting of Text Summary with Bounding Box
(BBox), Language Identification, Spatial Object-level Captioning, and
Step-by-step Logical Reasoning. Following this reasoning pipeline, we design an
automated data curation method that generates multilingual CoT annotations
through iterative generation, correction, and refinement, enabling scalable and
high-quality training data. To improve reasoning and generalization, LaV-CoT
adopts a two-stage training paradigm combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
with Language-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), guided by
verifiable multi-aspect rewards including language consistency, structural
accuracy, and semantic alignment. Extensive evaluations on public datasets
including MMMB, Multilingual MMBench, and MTVQA show that LaV-CoT achieves up
to \(\sim\)9.5\% accuracy improvements over open-source baselines of similar
size and even surpasses models with 2$\times$ larger scales by \(\sim\)2.6\%.
Moreover, LaV-CoT outperforms advanced proprietary models such as GPT-4o-0513
and Gemini-2.5-flash. We further conducted an online A/B test to validate our
method on real-world data, highlighting its effectiveness for industrial
deployment. Our code is available at this link:

TL;DR: 一种无需训练的框架，利用大语言模型消除颜色描述的歧义性，通过CIELAB颜色空间的空间关系精炼文本嵌入，提高文本到图像生成中颜色的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前渗透模型在处理细腻和复合颜色词语（如蒂芬尼蓝、柠檬绿、热粉红）时常常产生与人类意图不一致的图像，影响在时尚、产品可视化和室内设计等应用中的颜色对齐准确性。

Method: 首先使用大语言模型解析文本提示中的歧义颜色词语，然后基于CIELAB颜色空间中颜色词语的空间关系来精炼文本嵌入，指导颜色混合操作。该方法无需额外训练或外部参考图像。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架在不影响图像质量的情况下显著提高了颜色对齐的准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效地缩小了文本语义与视觉生成之间的差距，为提高文本到图像生成中颜色准确性提供了一种无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate color alignment in text-to-image (T2I) generation is critical for
applications such as fashion, product visualization, and interior design, yet
current diffusion models struggle with nuanced and compound color terms (e.g.,
Tiffany blue, lime green, hot pink), often producing images that are misaligned
with human intent. Existing approaches rely on cross-attention manipulation,
reference images, or fine-tuning but fail to systematically resolve ambiguous
color descriptions. To precisely render colors under prompt ambiguity, we
propose a training-free framework that enhances color fidelity by leveraging a
large language model (LLM) to disambiguate color-related prompts and guiding
color blending operations directly in the text embedding space. Our method
first employs a large language model (LLM) to resolve ambiguous color terms in
the text prompt, and then refines the text embeddings based on the spatial
relationships of the resulting color terms in the CIELAB color space. Unlike
prior methods, our approach improves color accuracy without requiring
additional training or external reference images. Experimental results
demonstrate that our framework improves color alignment without compromising
image quality, bridging the gap between text semantics and visual generation.

Conclusion: 研究不仅揭示了视觉语言模型在数学推理方面的局限性，还为推进无人机应用中可信视觉语言模型的发展提供了宝贵见解，数据集和代码将公开发布以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning is critical for tasks such as precise distance and
area computations, trajectory estimations, and spatial analysis in unmanned
aerial vehicle (UAV) based remote sensing, yet current vision-language models
(VLMs) have not been adequately tested in this domain. To address this gap, we
introduce AVI-Math, the first benchmark to rigorously evaluate multimodal
mathematical reasoning in aerial vehicle imagery, moving beyond simple counting
tasks to include domain-specific knowledge in areas such as geometry, logic,
and algebra. The dataset comprises 3,773 high-quality vehicle-related questions
captured from UAV views, covering 6 mathematical subjects and 20 topics. The
data, collected at varying altitudes and from multiple UAV angles, reflects
real-world UAV scenarios, ensuring the diversity and complexity of the
constructed mathematical problems. In this paper, we benchmark 14 prominent
VLMs through a comprehensive evaluation and demonstrate that, despite their
success on previous multimodal benchmarks, these models struggle with the
reasoning tasks in AVI-Math. Our detailed analysis highlights significant
limitations in the mathematical reasoning capabilities of current VLMs and
suggests avenues for future research. Furthermore, we explore the use of
Chain-of-Thought prompting and fine-tuning techniques, which show promise in
addressing the reasoning challenges in AVI-Math. Our findings not only expose
the limitations of VLMs in mathematical reasoning but also offer valuable
insights for advancing UAV-based trustworthy VLMs in real-world applications.

TL;DR: BEVTraj是一种基于鸟瞰图的轨迹预测框架，无需依赖预建高清地图，直接使用实时传感器数据进行端到端预测，性能媲美基于HD地图的先进模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶中轨迹预测对预建高清地图的依赖问题，HD地图区域受限且无法适应瞬时变化，而实时地图构建模块可能遗漏关键场景细节或引入错误。

Method: 提出BEVTraj框架，在鸟瞰图空间直接操作，利用可变形注意力从密集BEV特征中提取相关上下文，并引入稀疏目标候选提议模块实现完全端到端预测。

Result: 大量实验表明，BEVTraj在性能上可与最先进的基于HD地图的模型相媲美，同时通过消除对预建地图的依赖提供了更大的灵活性。

Conclusion: BEVTraj成功实现了不依赖预建地图的高精度轨迹预测，为自动驾驶系统提供了更灵活和适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: In autonomous driving, trajectory prediction is essential for ensuring safe
and efficient navigation. To improve prediction accuracy, recent approaches
often rely on pre-built high-definition (HD) maps or real-time local map
construction modules to incorporate static environmental information. However,
pre-built HD maps are limited to specific regions and cannot adapt to transient
changes. In addition, local map construction modules, which recognize only
predefined elements, may fail to capture critical scene details or introduce
errors that degrade prediction performance. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Bird's-Eye View Trajectory Prediction (BEVTraj), a novel trajectory
prediction framework that operates directly in the bird's-eye view (BEV) space
utilizing real-time sensor data without relying on any pre-built maps. The
BEVTraj leverages deformable attention to efficiently extract relevant context
from dense BEV features. Furthermore, we introduce a Sparse Goal Candidate
Proposal (SGCP) module, which enables full end-to-end prediction without
requiring any post-processing steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
BEVTraj achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art HD map-based models
while offering greater flexibility by eliminating the dependency on pre-built
maps. The source code is available at https://github.com/Kongminsang/bevtraj.

Result: 在遮挡场景下相比基线模型实现了4.20%的相对性能提升

Conclusion: 多视角信息能有效提升多人解析模型在遮挡情况下的性能，提出的训练框架和标注策略为解决该问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: Multi-human parsing is the task of segmenting human body parts while
associating each part to the person it belongs to, combining instance-level and
part-level information for fine-grained human understanding. In this work, we
demonstrate that, while state-of-the-art approaches achieved notable results on
public datasets, they struggle considerably in segmenting people with
overlapping bodies. From the intuition that overlapping people may appear
separated from a different point of view, we propose a novel training framework
exploiting multi-view information to improve multi-human parsing models under
occlusions. Our method integrates such knowledge during the training process,
introducing a novel approach based on weak supervision on human instances and a
multi-view consistency loss. Given the lack of suitable datasets in the
literature, we propose a semi-automatic annotation strategy to generate human
instance segmentation masks from multi-view RGB+D data and 3D human skeletons.
The experiments demonstrate that the approach can achieve up to a 4.20\%
relative improvement on human parsing over the baseline model in occlusion
scenarios.

Conclusion: VARCO-VISION-2.0模型推动了双语视觉语言模型的发展，具有实际应用价值，提供了14B完整版和1.7B轻量版两个变体。

Abstract: We introduce VARCO-VISION-2.0, an open-weight bilingual vision-language model
(VLM) for Korean and English with improved capabilities compared to the
previous model VARCO-VISION-14B. The model supports multi-image understanding
for complex inputs such as documents, charts, and tables, and delivers
layoutaware OCR by predicting both textual content and its spatial location.
Trained with a four-stage curriculum with memory-efficient techniques, the
model achieves enhanced multimodal alignment, while preserving core language
abilities and improving safety via preference optimization. Extensive benchmark
evaluations demonstrate strong spatial grounding and competitive results for
both languages, with the 14B model achieving 8th place on the OpenCompass VLM
leaderboard among models of comparable scale. Alongside the 14B-scale model, we
release a 1.7B version optimized for on-device deployment. We believe these

TL;DR: 轻量级面部图像质量评估方法，结合MobileNetV3-Small和ShuffleNetV2集成学习，通过MSECorrLoss损失函数提高与人类视觉的一致性，在保持高准确度的同时具有低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有面部图像质量评估方法或者无法抓取面部特定的降级特征，或者计算复杂度过高限制了实际应用。需要一种既高效又准确的方法来满足实际部署需求。

Method: 集成两个细粒度卷积神经网络(MobileNetV3-Small和ShuffleNetV2)，通过简单平均法进行预测级融合。使用MSECorrLoss损失函数，结合均方误差(MSE)和Pearson相关正则化器，以提高与人类视觉判断的一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法在准确性和计算效率之间取得了良好平衡，适合在实际环境中部署面部识别验证系统。

Abstract: Face image quality assessment (FIQA) plays a critical role in face
recognition and verification systems, especially in uncontrolled, real-world
environments. Although several methods have been proposed, general-purpose
no-reference image quality assessment techniques often fail to capture
face-specific degradations. Meanwhile, state-of-the-art FIQA models tend to be
computationally intensive, limiting their practical applicability. We propose a
lightweight and efficient method for FIQA, designed for the perceptual
evaluation of face images in the wild. Our approach integrates an ensemble of
two compact convolutional neural networks, MobileNetV3-Small and ShuffleNetV2,
with prediction-level fusion via simple averaging. To enhance alignment with
human perceptual judgments, we employ a correlation-aware loss (MSECorrLoss),
combining mean squared error (MSE) with a Pearson correlation regularizer. Our
method achieves a strong balance between accuracy and computational cost,
making it suitable for real-world deployment. Experiments on the VQualA FIQA
benchmark demonstrate that our model achieves a Spearman rank correlation
coefficient (SRCC) of 0.9829 and a Pearson linear correlation coefficient
(PLCC) of 0.9894, remaining within competition efficiency constraints.

Result: 在数量指标和视觉质量上超过了最先进的一步滑散方法，具备推理阶段灵活的现实性控制能力

Conclusion: RCOD框架为实际图像超分辨率任务提供了一种高效、可控的解决方案，在保持计算效率的同时实现了优异的复原质量

Abstract: Pre-trained diffusion models have shown great potential in real-world image
super-resolution (Real-ISR) tasks by enabling high-resolution reconstructions.
While one-step diffusion (OSD) methods significantly improve efficiency
compared to traditional multi-step approaches, they still have limitations in
balancing fidelity and realism across diverse scenarios. Since the OSDs for SR
are usually trained or distilled by a single timestep, they lack flexible
control mechanisms to adaptively prioritize these competing objectives, which
are inherently manageable in multi-step methods through adjusting sampling
steps. To address this challenge, we propose a Realism Controlled One-step
Diffusion (RCOD) framework for Real-ISR. RCOD provides a latent domain grouping
strategy that enables explicit control over fidelity-realism trade-offs during
the noise prediction phase with minimal training paradigm modifications and
original training data. A degradation-aware sampling strategy is also
introduced to align distillation regularization with the grouping strategy and
enhance the controlling of trade-offs. Moreover, a visual prompt injection
module is used to replace conventional text prompts with degradation-aware
visual tokens, enhancing both restoration accuracy and semantic consistency.
Our method achieves superior fidelity and perceptual quality while maintaining
computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RCOD
outperforms state-of-the-art OSD methods in both quantitative metrics and
visual qualities, with flexible realism control capabilities in the inference
stage. The code will be released.

Conclusion: Grad-CL框架通过创新的梯度引导和对比学习策略，成功解决了源数据不可用情况下的域自适应问题，为眼科疾病诊断提供了可靠的跨域分割解决方案

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the optic disc and cup is critical for the early
diagnosis and management of ocular diseases such as glaucoma. However,
segmentation models trained on one dataset often suffer significant performance
degradation when applied to target data acquired under different imaging
protocols or conditions. To address this challenge, we propose
\textbf{Grad-CL}, a novel source-free domain adaptation framework that
leverages a pre-trained source model and unlabeled target data to robustly
adapt segmentation performance without requiring access to the original source
data. Grad-CL combines a gradient-guided pseudolabel refinement module with a
cosine similarity-based contrastive learning strategy. In the first stage,
salient class-specific features are extracted via a gradient-based mechanism,
enabling more accurate uncertainty quantification and robust prototype
estimation for refining noisy pseudolabels. In the second stage, a contrastive
loss based on cosine similarity is employed to explicitly enforce inter-class
separability between the gradient-informed features of the optic cup and disc.
Extensive experiments on challenging cross-domain fundus imaging datasets
demonstrate that Grad-CL outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and
source-free domain adaptation methods, achieving superior segmentation accuracy
and improved boundary delineation. Project and code are available at

Conclusion: VQBridge提供了一种简单有效的方案来解决VQ训练的核心问题，高质量的离散化tokenizer对自回归图像生成至关重要，该方法具有良好的可扩展性和通用性

Abstract: Vector quantization (VQ) is a key component in discrete tokenizers for image
generation, but its training is often unstable due to straight-through
estimation bias, one-step-behind updates, and sparse codebook gradients, which
lead to suboptimal reconstruction performance and low codebook usage. In this
work, we analyze these fundamental challenges and provide a simple yet
effective solution. To maintain high codebook usage in VQ networks (VQN) during
learning annealing and codebook size expansion, we propose VQBridge, a robust,
scalable, and efficient projector based on the map function method. VQBridge
optimizes code vectors through a compress-process-recover pipeline, enabling
stable and effective codebook training. By combining VQBridge with learning
annealing, our VQN achieves full (100%) codebook usage across diverse codebook
configurations, which we refer to as FVQ (FullVQ). Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that FVQ is effective, scalable, and generalizable:
it attains 100% codebook usage even with a 262k-codebook, achieves
state-of-the-art reconstruction performance, consistently improves with larger
codebooks, higher vector channels, or longer training, and remains effective
across different VQ variants. Moreover, when integrated with LlamaGen, FVQ
significantly enhances image generation performance, surpassing visual
autoregressive models (VAR) by 0.5 and diffusion models (DiT) by 0.2 rFID,
highlighting the importance of high-quality tokenizers for strong
autoregressive image generation.

Conclusion: 渐进层冻结是一种简单有效的自监督视觉表征学习方法，能够昇级MAE方法的性能和可扩展性

Abstract: We introduce LayerLock, a simple yet effective approach for self-supervised
visual representation learning, that gradually transitions from pixel to latent
prediction through progressive layer freezing. First, we make the observation
that during training of video masked-autoencoding (MAE) models, ViT layers
converge in the order of their depth: shallower layers converge early, deeper
layers converge late. We then show that this observation can be exploited to
accelerate standard MAE by progressively freezing the model according to an
explicit schedule, throughout training. Furthermore, this same schedule can be
used in a simple and scalable approach to latent prediction that does not
suffer from "representation collapse". We apply our proposed approach,
LayerLock, to large models of up to 4B parameters with results surpassing those
of non-latent masked prediction on the 4DS perception suite.

Motivation: 空间机器人应用需要高精度的几何重建，但现有研究主要关注外观嵌入对光度质量的影响，缺乏对其在几何精度方面作用的系统评估。

Method: 使用SPEED+数据集，比较了K-Planes、高斯溅射和凸面溅射三种方法，分析外观嵌入对几何精度和表示效率的影响。

Result: 外观嵌入主要减少显式方法所需的基元数量，而非提升几何保真度。凸面溅射相比高斯溅射能产生更紧凑和无杂乱的表示。

Conclusion: 外观嵌入在几何中心任务中存在局限性，空间场景中的重建质量和表示效率需要权衡，凸面溅射在安全关键应用中具有优势。

Abstract: We present the first systematic comparison of implicit and explicit Novel
View Synthesis methods for space-based 3D object reconstruction, evaluating the
role of appearance embeddings. While embeddings improve photometric fidelity by
modeling lighting variation, we show they do not translate into meaningful
gains in geometric accuracy - a critical requirement for space robotics
applications. Using the SPEED+ dataset, we compare K-Planes, Gaussian
Splatting, and Convex Splatting, and demonstrate that embeddings primarily
reduce the number of primitives needed for explicit methods rather than
enhancing geometric fidelity. Moreover, convex splatting achieves more compact

Result: 在GenImage基准上实现了最先进的泛化性能，准确率提升5.8%，并且对新发布的GPT-4o等生成模型保持强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GAMMA通过减少域偏差和增强语义对齐，显著提高了AI生成图像检测器对未知生成模型的泛化能力，为解决生成模型多样性带来的检测挑战提供了有效方案。

Abstract: With generative models becoming increasingly sophisticated and diverse,
detecting AI-generated images has become increasingly challenging. While
existing AI-genereted Image detectors achieve promising performance on
in-distribution generated images, their generalization to unseen generative
models remains limited. This limitation is largely attributed to their reliance
on generation-specific artifacts, such as stylistic priors and compression
patterns. To address these limitations, we propose GAMMA, a novel training
framework designed to reduce domain bias and enhance semantic alignment. GAMMA
introduces diverse manipulation strategies, such as inpainting-based
manipulation and semantics-preserving perturbations, to ensure consistency
between manipulated and authentic content. We employ multi-task supervision
with dual segmentation heads and a classification head, enabling pixel-level
source attribution across diverse generative domains. In addition, a reverse
cross-attention mechanism is introduced to allow the segmentation heads to
guide and correct biased representations in the classification branch. Our
method achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on the GenImage
benchmark, imporving accuracy by 5.8%, but also maintains strong robustness on
newly released generative model such as GPT-4o.

*Ema Masterl,Tina Vipotnik Vesnaver,Žiga Špiclin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文对三种元胎脑部MRI超分辨率重建方法（NiftyMIC、SVRTK、NeSVoR）进行了综合评估，发现NeSVoR在健康和病理案例中都有最高的重建成功率，虽然体积测量存在差异，但诊断性能受SRR方法影响很小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 元胎脑部MRI存在分辨率低、运动伪影和3D解剖信息不足的问题。虽然有多种超分辨率重建方法，但它们在病理案例中的比较性能以及对下游任务的影响仍然未得到充分研究。

Method: 对140例元胎脑部MRI扫描（包括健康对照组和脑室扩大病理组）分别应用三种SRR方法，使用BoUNTi算法进行脑部结构分割，评估视觉质量、重建成功率、体积测量一致性和诊断分类性能。

Result: NeSVoR在健康和病理组都表现出最高和最一致的重建成功率（>90%）。虽然不同SRR方法间存在显著的体积测量差异，但脑室扩大的诊断分类性能并未受到SRR方法选择的影响。

Conclusion: NeSVoR方法具有更高的稳健性，而诊断性能在SRR导致的体积变异情况下仍保持良好。这为元胎脑部MRI重建方法的选择提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Fetal brain MRI relies on rapid multi-view 2D slice acquisitions to reduce
motion artifacts caused by fetal movement. However, these stacks are typically
low resolution, may suffer from motion corruption, and do not adequately
capture 3D anatomy. Super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) methods aim to
address these limitations by combining slice-to-volume registration and
super-resolution techniques to generate high-resolution (HR) 3D volumes. While
several SRR methods have been proposed, their comparative performance -
particularly in pathological cases - and their influence on downstream
volumetric analysis and diagnostic tasks remain underexplored. In this study,
we applied three state-of-the-art SRR method - NiftyMIC, SVRTK, and NeSVoR - to
140 fetal brain MRI scans, including both healthy controls (HC) and
pathological cases (PC) with ventriculomegaly (VM). Each HR reconstruction was
segmented using the BoUNTi algorithm to extract volumes of nine principal brain
structures. We evaluated visual quality, SRR success rates, volumetric
measurement agreement, and diagnostic classification performance. NeSVoR
demonstrated the highest and most consistent reconstruction success rate (>90%)
across both HC and PC groups. Although significant differences in volumetric
estimates were observed between SRR methods, classification performance for VM
was not affected by the choice of SRR method. These findings highlight NeSVoR's
robustness and the resilience of diagnostic performance despite SRR-induced
volumetric variability.

TL;DR: 通过提出面具一致性正则化(MCR)训练策略，解决了图像修补中的面具幻觉和面具形状偏辛两大挑战，提升了物体移除的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前涵散模型在物体移除任务中存在面具幻觉（在遮罩区域生成无关内容）和面具形状偏辛（生成与遮罩形状相似而非周围一致的内容）两大问题。

Method: 提出Mask Consistency Regularization (MCR)训练策略，在训练中引入两种面具批动：膣张和重形。通过强刻这些批动分支与原始面具输出的一致性，膣张面具帮助对齐周围内容，重形面具突破面具形状偏辛。

Result: 实验表明MCR显著减少了幻觉现象和面具形状偏辛，在物体移除任务中实现了更好的性能。

Conclusion: MCR能够生成更稳健和上下文一致的修补结果，有效解决了当前涵散模型在物体移除中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Object removal, a challenging task within image inpainting, involves
seamlessly filling the removed region with content that matches the surrounding
context. Despite advancements in diffusion models, current methods still face
two critical challenges. The first is mask hallucination, where the model
generates irrelevant or spurious content inside the masked region, and the
second is mask-shape bias, where the model fills the masked area with an object
that mimics the mask's shape rather than surrounding content. To address these
issues, we propose Mask Consistency Regularization (MCR), a novel training
strategy designed specifically for object removal tasks. During training, our
approach introduces two mask perturbations: dilation and reshape, enforcing
consistency between the outputs of these perturbed branches and the original
mask. The dilated masks help align the model's output with the surrounding
content, while reshaped masks encourage the model to break the mask-shape bias.
This combination of strategies enables MCR to produce more robust and
contextually coherent inpainting results. Our experiments demonstrate that MCR
significantly reduces hallucinations and mask-shape bias, leading to improved
performance in object removal.

Conclusion: MagicMirror框架为T2I生成模型的伪影评估提供了系统解决方案，揭示了当前模型在物理合理性方面的严重不足，为未来改进指明了方向

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has achieved remarkable progress in
instruction following and aesthetics. However, a persistent challenge is the
prevalence of physical artifacts, such as anatomical and structural flaws,
which severely degrade perceptual quality and limit application. Given the
diversity and complexity of these artifacts, a systematic and fine-grained
evaluation framework is required, which is lacking in current benchmarks. To
fill this gap, we introduce MagicMirror, a comprehensive framework for
artifacts assessment. We first establish a detailed taxonomy of generated image
artifacts. Guided by this taxonomy, we manually annotate MagicData340K, the
first human-annotated large-scale dataset of 340K generated images with
fine-grained artifact labels. Building on this dataset, we train MagicAssessor,
a Vision-Language Model (VLM) that provides detailed assessments and
corresponding labels. To overcome challenges like class imbalance and reward
hacking, we design a novel data sampling strategy and a multi-level reward
system for Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Finally, we leverage
MagicAssessor to construct MagicBench, an automated benchmark for evaluating
the image artifacts of current T2I models. Our evaluation with MagicBench
reveals that despite their widespread adoption, even top-tier models like
GPT-image-1 are consistently plagued by significant artifacts, highlighting
artifact reduction as a critical frontier for future T2I development. Project

Motivation: 现有手语翻译方法主要关注手势信号，忽视了嘴唇运动等非手动线索，而嘴唇运动在手语中传递重要语言信息，对区分视觉相似的手势至关重要。

Method: 提出SignClip框架，融合空间手势和嘴唇运动特征，引入分层对比学习框架，包含多级对齐目标，确保手语-嘴唇和视觉-文本模态间的语义一致性。

Result: 在PHOENIX14T数据集的无注释设置下，SignClip超越之前最佳模型SpaMo，BLEU-4从24.32提升到24.71，ROUGE从46.57提升到48.38。

Conclusion: 融合手动和非手动线索（特别是嘴唇运动）能显著提升手语翻译性能，分层对比学习框架有效确保了多模态间的语义一致性。

Abstract: Sign language translation (SLT) aims to translate natural language from sign
language videos, serving as a vital bridge for inclusive communication. While
recent advances leverage powerful visual backbones and large language models,
most approaches mainly focus on manual signals (hand gestures) and tend to
overlook non-manual cues like mouthing. In fact, mouthing conveys essential
linguistic information in sign languages and plays a crucial role in
disambiguating visually similar signs. In this paper, we propose SignClip, a
novel framework to improve the accuracy of sign language translation. It fuses
manual and non-manual cues, specifically spatial gesture and lip movement
features. Besides, SignClip introduces a hierarchical contrastive learning
framework with multi-level alignment objectives, ensuring semantic consistency
across sign-lip and visual-text modalities. Extensive experiments on two
benchmark datasets, PHOENIX14T and How2Sign, demonstrate the superiority of our
approach. For example, on PHOENIX14T, in the Gloss-free setting, SignClip
surpasses the previous state-of-the-art model SpaMo, improving BLEU-4 from
24.32 to 24.71, and ROUGE from 46.57 to 48.38.

Abstract: Recent works have shown the effectiveness of Large Vision Language Models
(VLMs or LVLMs) in image manipulation detection. However, text manipulation
detection is largely missing in these studies. We bridge this knowledge gap by
analyzing closed- and open-source VLMs on different text manipulation datasets.
Our results suggest that open-source models are getting closer, but still
behind closed-source ones like GPT- 4o. Additionally, we benchmark image
manipulation detection-specific VLMs for text manipulation detection and show
that they suffer from the generalization problem. We benchmark VLMs for
manipulations done on in-the-wild scene texts and on fantasy ID cards, where
the latter mimic a challenging real-world misuse.

Result: 大量实验证明MCL-AD框架在零样本3D异常检测中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过多模态协作学习，MCL-AD有效提升了零样本3D异常检测能力，为数据稀缺场景下的缺陷检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Zero-shot 3D (ZS-3D) anomaly detection aims to identify defects in 3D objects
without relying on labeled training data, making it especially valuable in
scenarios constrained by data scarcity, privacy, or high annotation cost.
However, most existing methods focus exclusively on point clouds, neglecting
the rich semantic cues available from complementary modalities such as RGB
images and texts priors. This paper introduces MCL-AD, a novel framework that
leverages multimodal collaboration learning across point clouds, RGB images,
and texts semantics to achieve superior zero-shot 3D anomaly detection.
Specifically, we propose a Multimodal Prompt Learning Mechanism (MPLM) that
enhances the intra-modal representation capability and inter-modal
collaborative learning by introducing an object-agnostic decoupled text prompt
and a multimodal contrastive loss. In addition, a collaborative modulation
mechanism (CMM) is proposed to fully leverage the complementary representations
of point clouds and RGB images by jointly modulating the RGB image-guided and
point cloud-guided branches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed MCL-AD framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in ZS-3D
anomaly detection.

Motivation: 深度神经网络和Vision Transformers在计算机视觉中表现优异但对抗扰动脆弱，现有防御方法计算成本高或缺乏形式化保证。

Method: Lipschitz引导的随机深度(DropPath)方法，drop概率随深度增加以控制网络有效Lipschitz常数，对深层进行正则化。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ViT-Tiny上的实验显示，该方法保持接近基线的清洁精度，提升了对FGSM、PGD-20和AutoAttack的鲁棒性，并显著减少了FLOPs。

Conclusion: 深度相关的DropPath调度是一种有效的正则化方法，能够同时提升模型鲁棒性和计算效率。

Abstract: Deep neural networks and Vision Transformers achieve state-of-the-art
performance in computer vision but are highly vulnerable to adversarial
perturbations. Standard defenses often incur high computational cost or lack
formal guarantees. We propose a Lipschitz-guided stochastic depth (DropPath)
method, where drop probabilities increase with depth to control the effective
Lipschitz constant of the network. This approach regularizes deeper layers,
improving robustness while preserving clean accuracy and reducing computation.
Experiments on CIFAR-10 with ViT-Tiny show that our custom depth-dependent
schedule maintains near-baseline clean accuracy, enhances robustness under
FGSM, PGD-20, and AutoAttack, and significantly reduces FLOPs compared to
baseline and linear DropPath schedules.

Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of precise geolocation of street
furniture in complex urban environments, which is a critical task for effective
monitoring and maintenance of public infrastructure by local authorities and
private stakeholders. To this end, we propose a probabilistic framework based
on energy maps that encode the spatial likelihood of object locations.
Representing the energy in a map-based geopositioned format allows the
optimisation process to seamlessly integrate external geospatial information,
such as GIS layers, road maps, or placement constraints, which improves
contextual awareness and localisation accuracy. A stochastic birth-and-death
optimisation algorithm is introduced to infer the most probable configuration
of assets. We evaluate our approach using a realistic simulation informed by a
geolocated dataset of street lighting infrastructure in Dublin city centre,
demonstrating its potential for scalable and accurate urban asset mapping. The
implementation of the algorithm will be made available in the GitHub repository

Motivation: 扩散变换器计算成本高，现有特征缓存方法只利用时间相似性而忽略了空间相似性

Method: 对每个时间步的token进行空间聚类，每个簇只计算一个token并将其信息传播给其他token，减少90%以上token数量

Result: 在DiT、FLUX和HunyuanVideo上验证有效性，FLUX加速4.96倍且ImageReward达到99.49%（比原模型提升0.51%）

Conclusion: ClusCa是一种无需训练即可直接应用于任何扩散变换器的有效加速方法，与现有特征缓存方法正交互补

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have gained significant attention in recent years for
their ability to generate high-quality images and videos, yet still suffer from
a huge computational cost due to their iterative denoising process. Recently,
feature caching has been introduced to accelerate diffusion transformers by
caching the feature computation in previous timesteps and reusing it in the
following timesteps, which leverage the temporal similarity of diffusion models
while ignoring the similarity in the spatial dimension. In this paper, we
introduce Cluster-Driven Feature Caching (ClusCa) as an orthogonal and
complementary perspective for previous feature caching. Specifically, ClusCa
performs spatial clustering on tokens in each timestep, computes only one token
in each cluster and propagates their information to all the other tokens, which
is able to reduce the number of tokens by over 90%. Extensive experiments on
DiT, FLUX and HunyuanVideo demonstrate its effectiveness in both text-to-image
and text-to-video generation. Besides, it can be directly applied to any
diffusion transformer without requirements for training. For instance, ClusCa
achieves 4.96x acceleration on FLUX with an ImageReward of 99.49%, surpassing
the original model by 0.51%. The code is available at

TL;DR: I-Segmenter是首个完全整数化的ViT分割框架，通过系统替换浮点运算、提出新激活函数λ-ShiftGELU、移除L2归一化层和改进上采样方法，在保持精度的同时显著减小模型大小并加速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers在语义分割中表现优异，但在资源受限设备上部署困难，主要由于高内存占用和计算成本。量化是提高效率的有效策略，但ViT分割模型在低精度下表现脆弱，量化误差会在深度编码器-解码器管道中累积。

Method: 基于Segmenter架构，系统替换浮点运算为整数运算；提出λ-ShiftGELU激活函数处理长尾激活分布；移除L2归一化层；将双线性插值替换为最近邻上采样，确保整个计算图的整数化执行。

Result: I-Segmenter在精度上与FP32基线相差平均5.1%，同时模型大小减少达3.8倍，推理速度提升达1.2倍。即使在单张校准图像的一次性PTQ设置下，也能提供有竞争力的精度。

Conclusion: I-Segmenter是首个完全整数化的ViT分割框架，通过创新的量化技术和架构修改，在保持合理精度的同时显著提升了效率，证明了其在现实世界部署中的实用性。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have recently achieved strong results in semantic
segmentation, yet their deployment on resource-constrained devices remains
limited due to their high memory footprint and computational cost. Quantization
offers an effective strategy to improve efficiency, but ViT-based segmentation
models are notoriously fragile under low precision, as quantization errors
accumulate across deep encoder-decoder pipelines. We introduce I-Segmenter, the
first fully integer-only ViT segmentation framework. Building on the Segmenter
architecture, I-Segmenter systematically replaces floating-point operations
with integer-only counterparts. To further stabilize both training and
inference, we propose $\lambda$-ShiftGELU, a novel activation function that
mitigates the limitations of uniform quantization in handling long-tailed
activation distributions. In addition, we remove the L2 normalization layer and
replace bilinear interpolation in the decoder with nearest neighbor upsampling,
ensuring integer-only execution throughout the computational graph. Extensive
experiments show that I-Segmenter achieves accuracy within a reasonable margin
of its FP32 baseline (5.1 % on average), while reducing model size by up to
3.8x and enabling up to 1.2x faster inference with optimized runtimes. Notably,
even in one-shot PTQ with a single calibration image, I-Segmenter delivers
competitive accuracy, underscoring its practicality for real-world deployment.

Motivation: OCT图像受散斑噪声影响严重，现有去噪方法难以平衡噪声去除与解剖结构保留。传统扩散模型假设高斯噪声，与散斑的统计特性不符

Method: 提出基于伽马分布的扩散概率模型(GARD)，引入噪声减少保真度项指导去噪过程，采用DDIM框架加速推理

Conclusion: GARD通过伽马扩散模型和噪声减少保真度项，有效解决了OCT图像去噪中噪声去除与结构保留的平衡问题，为医学图像处理提供了新思路

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a vital imaging modality for diagnosing
and monitoring retinal diseases. However, OCT images are inherently degraded by
speckle noise, which obscures fine details and hinders accurate interpretation.
While numerous denoising methods exist, many struggle to balance noise
reduction with the preservation of crucial anatomical structures. This paper
introduces GARD (Gamma-based Anatomical Restoration and Denoising), a novel
deep learning approach for OCT image despeckling that leverages the strengths
of diffusion probabilistic models. Unlike conventional diffusion models that
assume Gaussian noise, GARD employs a Denoising Diffusion Gamma Model to more
accurately reflect the statistical properties of speckle. Furthermore, we
introduce a Noise-Reduced Fidelity Term that utilizes a pre-processed,
less-noisy image to guide the denoising process. This crucial addition prevents
the reintroduction of high-frequency noise. We accelerate the inference process
by adapting the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model framework to our Gamma-based
model. Experiments on a dataset with paired noisy and less-noisy OCT B-scans
demonstrate that GARD significantly outperforms traditional denoising methods
and state-of-the-art deep learning models in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and MSE.
Qualitative results confirm that GARD produces sharper edges and better
preserves fine anatomical details.

Abstract: Mammography screening is an essential tool for early detection of breast
cancer. The speed and accuracy of mammography interpretation have the potential
to be improved with deep learning methods. However, the development of a
foundation visual language model (VLM) is hindered by limited data and domain
differences between natural and medical images. Existing mammography VLMs,
adapted from natural images, often ignore domain-specific characteristics, such
as multi-view relationships in mammography. Unlike radiologists who analyze
both views together to process ipsilateral correspondence, current methods
treat them as independent images or do not properly model the multi-view
correspondence learning, losing critical geometric context and resulting in
suboptimal prediction. We propose GLAM: Global and Local Alignment for
Multi-view mammography for VLM pretraining using geometry guidance. By
leveraging the prior knowledge about the multi-view imaging process of
mammograms, our model learns local cross-view alignments and fine-grained local
features through joint global and local, visual-visual, and visual-language
contrastive learning. Pretrained on EMBED [14], one of the largest open

Abstract: Visual grounding refers to the ability of a model to identify a region within
some visual input that matches a textual description. Consequently, a model
equipped with visual grounding capabilities can target a wide range of
applications in various domains, including referring expression comprehension,

caption visual context by explicitly referring to entities, as well as low and
high-level control in simulated and real environments. In this survey paper, we
review representative works across the key areas of research on modern
general-purpose vision language models (VLMs). We first outline the importance
of grounding in VLMs, then delineate the core components of the contemporary
paradigm for developing grounded models, and examine their practical
applications, including benchmarks and evaluation metrics for grounded
multimodal generation. We also discuss the multifaceted interrelations among
visual grounding, multimodal chain-of-thought, and reasoning in VLMs. Finally,
we analyse the challenges inherent to visual grounding and suggest promising
directions for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本图像编辑方法容易受到对手性攻击，需要一种新的攻击方法来破坏编辑过程中的视觉组件。

Method: 使用自动生成的源图片标题作为编辑提示的代理，干扰文本提示与图像表征之间的跨注意力机制，无需知道编辑方法或编辑提示。

Result: 在TEDBench++基准测试中，该攻击显著降低了编辑性能，同时保持不可见性。提出了标题相似性和语义IoU两种新的评估方法。

Conclusion: Attention Attack通过破坏文本-图像对齐来有效攻击文本图像编辑系统，为识别和防范这类漏洞提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-based image editing have enabled fine-grained
manipulation of visual content guided by natural language. However, such
methods are susceptible to adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose a
novel attack that targets the visual component of editing methods. We introduce
Attention Attack, which disrupts the cross-attention between a textual prompt
and the visual representation of the image by using an automatically generated
caption of the source image as a proxy for the edit prompt. This breaks the
alignment between the contents of the image and their textual description,
without requiring knowledge of the editing method or the editing prompt.
Reflecting on the reliability of existing metrics for immunization success, we
propose two novel evaluation strategies: Caption Similarity, which quantifies
semantic consistency between original and adversarial edits, and semantic
Intersection over Union (IoU), which measures spatial layout disruption via
segmentation masks. Experiments conducted on the TEDBench++ benchmark
demonstrate that our attack significantly degrades editing performance while
remaining imperceptible.

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏为神经网络图像压缩的资源优化提供了有效途径，未来可探索不同教师模型和损失函数的影响，并扩展到基于transformer的模型。

Abstract: Learned image compression sits at the intersection of machine learning and
image processing. With advances in deep learning, neural network-based
compression methods have emerged. In this process, an encoder maps the image to
a low-dimensional latent space, which is then quantized, entropy-coded into a
binary bitstream, and transmitted to the receiver. At the receiver end, the
bitstream is entropy-decoded, and a decoder reconstructs an approximation of
the original image. Recent research suggests that these models consistently
outperform conventional codecs. However, they require significant processing
power, making them unsuitable for real-time use on resource-constrained
platforms, which hinders their deployment in mainstream applications. This
study aims to reduce the resource requirements of neural networks used for
image compression by leveraging knowledge distillation, a training paradigm
where smaller neural networks, partially trained on the outputs of larger, more
complex models, can achieve better performance than when trained independently.
Our work demonstrates that knowledge distillation can be effectively applied to
image compression tasks: i) across various architecture sizes, ii) to achieve
different image quality/bit rate tradeoffs, and iii) to save processing and
energy resources. This approach introduces new settings and hyperparameters,
and future research could explore the impact of different teacher models, as
well as alternative loss functions. Knowledge distillation could also be
extended to transformer-based models. The code is publicly available at:

Conclusion: 该方法为获取真实场景的顺序监督信号提供了可扩展的途径，这在之前通过手动标注是不可行的

Abstract: Decomposing an image into its intrinsic photometric factors--shading and
reflectance--is a long-standing challenge due to the lack of extensive
ground-truth data for real-world scenes. Recent methods rely on synthetic data
or sparse annotations for limited indoor and even fewer outdoor scenes. We
introduce a novel training-free approach for intrinsic image decomposition
using only a pair of visible and thermal images. We leverage the principle that
light not reflected from an opaque surface is absorbed and detected as heat by
a thermal camera. This allows us to relate the ordinalities between visible and
thermal image intensities to the ordinalities of shading and reflectance, which
can densely self-supervise an optimizing neural network to recover shading and
reflectance. We perform quantitative evaluations with known reflectance and
shading under natural and artificial lighting, and qualitative experiments
across diverse outdoor scenes. The results demonstrate superior performance
over recent learning-based models and point toward a scalable path to curating
real-world ordinal supervision, previously infeasible via manual labeling.

Abstract: Compressed video quality enhancement (CVQE) is crucial for improving user
experience with lossy video codecs like H.264/AVC, H.265/HEVC, and H.266/VVC.
While deep learning based CVQE has driven significant progress, existing
surveys still suffer from limitations: lack of systematic classification
linking methods to specific standards and artifacts, insufficient comparative
analysis of architectural paradigms across coding types, and underdeveloped
benchmarking practices. To address these gaps, this paper presents three key
contributions. First, it introduces a novel taxonomy classifying CVQE methods
across architectural paradigms, coding standards, and compressed-domain feature
utilization. Second, it proposes a unified benchmarking framework integrating
modern compression protocols and standard test sequences for fair
multi-criteria evaluation. Third, it provides a systematic analysis of the
critical trade-offs between reconstruction performance and computational
complexity observed in state-of-the-art methods and highlighting promising
directions for future research. This comprehensive review aims to establish a
foundation for consistent assessment and informed model selection in CVQE
research and deployment.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation, a key task in computer vision with broad applications
in autonomous driving, medical imaging, and robotics, has advanced
substantially with deep learning. Nevertheless, current approaches remain
vulnerable to challenging conditions such as poor lighting, occlusions, and
adverse weather. To address these limitations, multimodal methods that
integrate auxiliary sensor data (e.g., LiDAR, infrared) have recently emerged,
providing complementary information that enhances robustness. In this work, we
present MM SAM-adapter, a novel framework that extends the capabilities of the
Segment Anything Model (SAM) for multimodal semantic segmentation. The proposed
method employs an adapter network that injects fused multimodal features into
SAM's rich RGB features. This design enables the model to retain the strong
generalization ability of RGB features while selectively incorporating
auxiliary modalities only when they contribute additional cues. As a result, MM
SAM-adapter achieves a balanced and efficient use of multimodal information. We
evaluate our approach on three challenging benchmarks, DeLiVER, FMB, and MUSES,
where MM SAM-adapter delivers state-of-the-art performance. To further analyze
modality contributions, we partition DeLiVER and FMB into RGB-easy and RGB-hard
subsets. Results consistently demonstrate that our framework outperforms
competing methods in both favorable and adverse conditions, highlighting the
effectiveness of multimodal adaptation for robust scene understanding. The code

TL;DR: InfGen是一个基于潜在扩散模型的第二代图像生成框架，通过用一步生成器替换VAE解码器，可以从固定大小的潜在表示生成任意分辨率的图像，显著降低计算复杂度并将4K图像生成时间从100多秒减少到10秒以内。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前扩散模型在生成高分辨率图像时计算需求随分辨率平方增长的问题，4K图像生成延迟超过100秒，需要一种更高效的任意分辨率图像生成方法。

Method: 在潜在扩散模型基础上，将扩散模型生成的固定潜在表示作为内容表示，提出使用一步生成器来解码任意分辨率的图像，用新的生成器替换VAE解码器。

Result: InfGen能够在不重新训练扩散模型的情况下从固定大小的潜在表示生成任意分辨率的图像，将4K图像生成时间从100多秒减少到10秒以内，显著降低了计算复杂度。

Conclusion: InfGen框架成功地将许多模型带入任意高分辨率时代，简化了生成过程，降低了计算复杂度，并且可以应用于使用相同潜在空间的任何模型。

Abstract: Arbitrary resolution image generation provides a consistent visual experience
across devices, having extensive applications for producers and consumers.
Current diffusion models increase computational demand quadratically with
resolution, causing 4K image generation delays over 100 seconds. To solve this,
we explore the second generation upon the latent diffusion models, where the
fixed latent generated by diffusion models is regarded as the content
representation and we propose to decode arbitrary resolution images with a
compact generated latent using a one-step generator. Thus, we present the
\textbf{InfGen}, replacing the VAE decoder with the new generator, for
generating images at any resolution from a fixed-size latent without retraining
the diffusion models, which simplifies the process, reducing computational
complexity and can be applied to any model using the same latent space.
Experiments show InfGen is capable of improving many models into the arbitrary
high-resolution era while cutting 4K image generation time to under 10 seconds.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder that causes
memory loss and cognitive decline. While there has been extensive research in
applying deep learning models to Alzheimer's prediction tasks, these models
remain limited by lack of available labeled data, poor generalization across
datasets, and inflexibility to varying numbers of input scans and time
intervals between scans. In this study, we adapt three state-of-the-art
temporal self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches for 3D brain MRI analysis,
and add novel extensions designed to handle variable-length inputs and learn
robust spatial features. We aggregate four publicly available datasets
comprising 3,161 patients for pre-training, and show the performance of our
model across multiple Alzheimer's prediction tasks including diagnosis
classification, conversion detection, and future conversion prediction.
Importantly, our SSL model implemented with temporal order prediction and
contrastive learning outperforms supervised learning on six out of seven
downstream tasks. It demonstrates adaptability and generalizability across
tasks and number of input images with varying time intervals, highlighting its
capacity for robust performance across clinical applications. We release our
code and model publicly at https://github.com/emilykaczmarek/SSL-AD.
