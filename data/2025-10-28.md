### [2] [Policy Optimization Prefers The Path of Least Resistance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21853)
*Debdeep Sanyal,Aakash Sen Sharma,Dhruv Kumar,Saurabh Deshpande,Murari Mandal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 政策优化算法在开放式的思维链结构中倾向于选择最简单路径，丢弃显式推理而直接输出答案，即使复杂格式被赋予更高奖励权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究当严格思维链格式约束放松为开放式结构时，政策优化算法的行为表现，填补这一研究空白。

Method: 通过一系列控制实验和奖励分解实验，分析不同模型和算法在开放式思维链结构中的行为模式。

Result: 政策优化始终遵循最小阻力路径，即使复杂思维链格式被赋予4倍奖励权重，模型仍会退化到仅输出答案的简单格式。

Conclusion: 给予政策优化的自由度是一把双刃剑：既能发现高奖励捷径，也容易导致奖励函数被简单利用，这对对齐任务构成关键挑战。

Abstract: Policy optimization (PO) algorithms are used to refine Large Language Models
for complex, multi-step reasoning. Current state-of-the-art pipelines enforce a
strict think-then-answer format to elicit chain-of-thought (CoT); however, the
behavior of PO when these rigid constraints are relaxed into an open-ended CoT
structure remains an under-studied question. We investigate this gap with an
extensive suite of controlled experiments and identify a consistent principle:
\textit{policy optimization consistently follows the path of least resistance}.
When afforded the flexibility to interleave reasoning and response, policy
optimization consistently learns to discard explicit reasoning, causing the
policy to degenerate to a direct \texttt{<answer>}-only format. This outcome
holds true across various models and algorithms. We find that this collapse in
format is persistent even when the complex \texttt{<think><answer>} format is
assigned up to 4x larger reward weights. We formalize this principle through a
series of controlled reward decomposition experiments, demonstrating a clear
hierarchy: PO systematically optimizes for the simplest reward component first,
a preference that holds even when faced with mutually exclusive choices or
strong incentives for more complex behaviors. Finally, we show that successful
convergence on the high-reward shortcut is not a low-effort drift but is driven
by the optimization process that requires the KL-regularized policy to have
sufficient freedom to make a significant shift from its initial prior. Our
findings reveal that granting policies the freedom to diverge is a double-edged
sword: while necessary for discovering high-reward shortcuts, it also creates a
powerful incentive to game the simplest aspects of the reward function, posing
a critical challenge for reward hacking under alignment.

### [3] [Language Ranker: A Lightweight Ranking framework for LLM Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21883)
*Chenheng Zhang,Tianqi Du,Jizhe Zhang,Mingqing Xiao,Yifei Wang,Yisen Wang,Zhouchen Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Language Ranker框架，将LLM解码过程类比推荐系统排序阶段，通过轻量级模块重排候选响应，在性能媲美大型奖励模型的同时显著降低计算开销


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM研究主要关注输出分布优化，忽视了解码过程的重要性。现有奖励模型方法计算成本高且适用性有限，传统解码方法和奖励模型都存在冗余等明显局限

Method: 基于推荐系统视角，将解码过程类比推荐排序阶段，引入轻量级模块使用基础模型提取的特征对候选响应进行重排

Result: 在多种任务上的实验表明，Language Ranker性能与大型奖励模型相当，仅需<0.5M额外参数，显著降低训练和推理阶段的计算开销

Conclusion: 该方法高效且有效，展示了充分释放LLM潜力的潜力，为解码过程优化提供了新思路

Abstract: Conventional research on large language models (LLMs) has primarily focused
on refining output distributions, while paying less attention to the decoding
process that transforms these distributions into final responses. Recent
advances, such as scaling the computation of inference time with reward models,
have underscored the importance of decoding, but these methods often suffer
from high computational costs and limited applicability. In this paper, we
revisit LLM generation through the lens of recommender systems, conceptualizing
the decoding process as analogous to the ranking stage in recommendation
pipelines. From this perspective, we observe that both traditional decoding
methods and reward models exhibit clear limitations such as redundancy.
Motivated by this insight, we propose Language Ranker, a novel framework that
introduces a lightweight module to rerank candidate responses using features
extracted by the base model. Experiments across a wide range of tasks show that
Language Ranker achieves performance comparable to large-scale reward models,
while requiring only <0.5M additional parameters, significantly reducing the
computational overhead during both training and inference stages. This
highlights the efficiency and effectiveness of our method, showcasing its
potential to fully unlock the capabilities of LLMs.

### [4] [Framework for Machine Evaluation of Reasoning Completeness in Large Language Models For Classification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21884)
*Avinash Patil*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了RACE框架，用于评估LLM生成解释与逻辑回归特征重要性分数之间的对齐程度，发现正确预测包含更多支持特征，错误预测包含更多矛盾特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习在敏感领域的应用增加，对可解释AI的需求日益增长。LLM能够生成自然语言解释，但这些解释是否真实反映决策依据尚不明确。

Method: 使用RACE框架，在四个文本分类数据集上比较LLM解释与逻辑回归的特征重要性分数，采用token感知、精确字符串匹配和编辑距离匹配技术。

Result: 实证结果显示一致的不对称性：正确预测覆盖更多支持特征，错误预测覆盖更多矛盾特征。编辑距离匹配发现释义重叠，提高了覆盖率但保持不对称性。

Conclusion: LLM解释结合了表面层次和灵活的证据重用，但在错误情况下也可能放大误导性线索。RACE为评估LLM解释的忠实性和推理完整性提供了量化基础。

Abstract: The growing adoption of machine learning (ML) in sensitive domains has
heightened the demand for transparent and interpretable artificial
intelligence. Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of
producing natural language explanations, yet it remains unclear whether these
rationales faithfully capture the predictive signals that underlie decisions.
This paper introduces RACE-Reasoning Alignment for Completeness of
Explanations, a systematic framework to evaluate the alignment between
LLM-generated explanations and interpretable feature importance scores derived
from a logistic regression baseline. We analyze four widely used text
classification datasets-WIKI ONTOLOGY, AG NEWS, IMDB, and GOEMOTIONS-and
compare LLM rationales against top-ranked supporting and contradicting lexical
features. To capture alignment at multiple levels of granularity, RACE
implements token-aware, exact string, and edit-distance matching techniques.
Empirical results reveal a consistent asymmetry: correct predictions exhibit
higher coverage of supporting features, while incorrect predictions are
associated with elevated coverage of contradicting features. Edit-distance
matching further uncovers paraphrastic overlaps, boosting coverage while
preserving this asymmetry. These findings demonstrate that LLM rationales
combine both surface-level and flexible evidence reuse, yet can also amplify
misleading cues in error cases. RACE provides new insights into the
faithfulness of LLM explanations and establishes a quantitative basis for
evaluating reasoning completeness in neural language models.

### [5] [Preventing Catastrophic Forgetting: Behavior-Aware Sampling for Safer Language Model Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21885)
*Anh Pham,Mihir Thalanki,Michael Sun,Aditya Chaloo,Ankita Gupta,Tian Xia,Aditya Mate,Ehimwenma Nosakhare,Soundararajan Srinivasan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出行为感知采样框架，通过选择基于指令-响应行为和语义多样性的安全示例，有效缓解大语言模型微调时的灾难性遗忘问题，仅用0.5%额外训练数据就能将有害输出减少41%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在良性数据微调时经常失去之前对齐的安全行为，即灾难性遗忘现象。现有方法通过添加随机安全示例来缓解，但哪些示例最有效仍不明确。

Method: 提出行为感知采样框架，基于两个互补因素选择安全示例：指令-响应行为（如拒绝vs遵从）和跨伤害类别的语义多样性。

Result: 系统性评估显示，该方法显著减少有害输出同时保持有用性，仅用0.5%额外训练数据就能将有害性降低41%。

Conclusion: 这些结果表明，有针对性的数据选择可以大规模提高微调的安全性和效率。

Abstract: Large language models often lose previously aligned safety behaviors when
fine-tuned on benign data, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Prior
work shows that adding random safety examples can mitigate this effect, but it
remains unclear which examples are most effective. We propose a behavior-aware
sampling framework that selects safety examples based on two complementary
factors: instruction-response behavior (e.g., refusal versus compliance) and
semantic diversity across harm categories. Systematic evaluation shows that
this approach substantially reduces harmful outputs while maintaining
helpfulness, achieving up to a 41% reduction in harmfulness with only 0.5%
additional training data. These results highlight how targeted data selection
can improve the safety and efficiency of fine-tuning at scale.

### [6] [Embedding Trust: Semantic Isotropy Predicts Nonfactuality in Long-Form Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21891)
*Dhrupad Bhardwaj,Julia Kempe,Tim G. J. Rudner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于语义各向同性（语义嵌入在单位球面上的均匀性）来评估LLM长文本响应的可信度，无需标注数据、微调或超参数选择，仅需少量样本即可有效预测事实不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖逐项事实核查，计算成本高且在长文本开放提示响应中表现脆弱，需要可靠且计算成本低的方法来评估LLM长文本响应的可信度。

Method: 生成多个长文本响应，将其嵌入到向量空间，通过计算嵌入向量在单位球面上的角度离散度来估计语义各向同性水平。

Result: 更高的语义各向同性（即更大的嵌入离散度）可靠地表示样本间的事实一致性较低。该方法在多个领域始终优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为将可信度评估集成到实际LLM工作流程中提供了一种实用、低成本的解决方案。

Abstract: To deploy large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes application domains
that require substantively accurate responses to open-ended prompts, we need
reliable, computationally inexpensive methods that assess the trustworthiness
of long-form responses generated by LLMs. However, existing approaches often
rely on claim-by-claim fact-checking, which is computationally expensive and
brittle in long-form responses to open-ended prompts. In this work, we
introduce semantic isotropy -- the degree of uniformity across normalized text
embeddings on the unit sphere -- and use it to assess the trustworthiness of
long-form responses generated by LLMs. To do so, we generate several long-form
responses, embed them, and estimate the level of semantic isotropy of these
responses as the angular dispersion of the embeddings on the unit sphere. We
find that higher semantic isotropy -- that is, greater embedding dispersion --
reliably signals lower factual consistency across samples. Our approach
requires no labeled data, no fine-tuning, and no hyperparameter selection, and
can be used with open- or closed-weight embedding models. Across multiple
domains, our method consistently outperforms existing approaches in predicting
nonfactuality in long-form responses using only a handful of samples --
offering a practical, low-cost approach for integrating trust assessment into
real-world LLM workflows.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NetMind是一个使用自然语言查询网络的框架，通过树状配置分块、统一事实图和混合语言设计，解决了LLM在网络配置分析中的长上下文、异构性和复杂推理挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大规模网络配置复杂，传统基于领域特定语言的方法学习曲线陡峭且灵活性有限。自然语言提供了更易访问的接口，但LLM面临长配置文件、设备异构性和复杂网络推理三大挑战。

Method: 1) 树状配置分块策略保持语义连贯性；2) 构建统一事实图作为中间表示；3) 设计混合命令式-声明式语言减轻LLM推理负担。

Result: 实验表明NetMind在准确性和可扩展性方面优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: NetMind通过创新的配置处理、统一表示和混合语言设计，实现了精确且可扩展的网络行为理解，为自然语言网络查询提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Modern large-scale networks introduce significant complexity in understanding
network behaviors, increasing the risk of misconfiguration. Prior work proposed
to understand network behaviors by mining network configurations, typically
relying on domain-specific languages interfaced with formal models. While
effective, they suffer from a steep learning curve and limited flexibility. In
contrast, natural language (NL) offers a more accessible and interpretable
interface, motivating recent research on NL-guided network behavior
understanding. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) further enhance
this direction, leveraging their extensive prior knowledge of network concepts
and strong reasoning capabilities. However, three key challenges remain: 1)
numerous router devices with lengthy configuration files challenge LLM's
long-context understanding ability; 2) heterogeneity across devices and
protocols impedes scalability; and 3) complex network topologies and protocols
demand advanced reasoning abilities beyond the current capabilities of LLMs. To
tackle the above challenges, we propose NetMind, a novel framework for querying
networks using NL. Our approach introduces a tree-based configuration chunking
strategy to preserve semantic coherence while enabling efficient partitioning.
We then construct a unified fact graph as an intermediate representation to
normalize vendor-specific configurations. Finally, we design a hybrid
imperative-declarative language to reduce the reasoning burden on LLMs and
enhance precision. We contribute a benchmark consisting of NL question-answer
pairs paired with network configurations. Experiments demonstrate that NetMind
achieves accurate and scalable network behavior understanding, outperforming
existing baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于循环大纲生成的迭代式文献综述框架，通过规划代理逐步检索、阅读和更新大纲，确保内容的探索性和连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动文献综述系统采用一次性检索和静态大纲生成，导致检索噪声大、结构碎片化、上下文过载，限制了综述质量。

Method: 设计基于循环大纲生成的框架，使用规划代理迭代检索和更新大纲；引入论文卡片提炼每篇论文的贡献、方法和发现；采用审查-精炼循环和可视化增强来改善文本流并整合多模态元素。

Result: 在既有和新兴主题上的实验表明，该方法在内容覆盖度、结构连贯性和引用质量方面显著优于现有基线，生成更易访问和组织更好的综述。

Conclusion: 提出的迭代式文献综述框架通过循环大纲生成和论文卡片设计，有效解决了传统方法的局限性，同时引入Survey-Arena基准提供了更可靠的评估方法。

Abstract: Automatic literature survey generation has attracted increasing attention,
yet most existing systems follow a one-shot paradigm, where a large set of
papers is retrieved at once and a static outline is generated before drafting.
This design often leads to noisy retrieval, fragmented structures, and context
overload, ultimately limiting survey quality. Inspired by the iterative reading
process of human researchers, we propose \ours, a framework based on recurrent
outline generation, in which a planning agent incrementally retrieves, reads,
and updates the outline to ensure both exploration and coherence. To provide
faithful paper-level grounding, we design paper cards that distill each paper
into its contributions, methods, and findings, and introduce a
review-and-refine loop with visualization enhancement to improve textual flow
and integrate multimodal elements such as figures and tables. Experiments on
both established and emerging topics show that \ours\ substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in content coverage, structural coherence, and
citation quality, while producing more accessible and better-organized surveys.
To provide a more reliable assessment of such improvements, we further
introduce Survey-Arena, a pairwise benchmark that complements absolute scoring
and more clearly positions machine-generated surveys relative to human-written
ones. The code is available at
https://github.com/HancCui/IterSurvey\_Autosurveyv2.

*Catherine Arnett,Tyler A. Chang,Stella Biderman,Benjamin K. Bergen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The number of tokens it takes to encode parallel text in different languages
is known to vary. These disparities are called token premiums. Having high
token premiums leads to less throughput during training and increases costs at
inference. In this paper, we show that even after controlling for dataset size,
vocabulary size, and data content, monolingual tokenizers exhibit a wide range
of token premiums across languages. To understand the cross-linguistic
differences that cause these token premiums, we train a suite of approximately
7,000 comparable monolingual tokenizers for 97 languages, manipulating
tokenization algorithm, vocabulary size, and dataset size. We measure token
premiums and test for a relationship between factors such as data similarity
(between tokenizer training and evaluation), vocabulary size, and
pre-tokenization. We also investigate the role of language-specific features
such as writing system and word length. We find that similarity between
training and test data does not impact token premiums, but vocabulary size and
pre-tokenization do. While simply increasing vocabulary size does not lead to
reduced token premium effects, we can determine an ``optimal'' vocabulary size
for each language to achieve significantly reduced token premium effects. We
also train superword tokenizers which allow merges over whitespaces, and we
find that they both reduce token premium effects and improve compression
overall. Thus, intervening on the vocabulary size or the pre-tokenizer
significantly reduces crosslingual token premium effects.

### [10] [Model-Aware Tokenizer Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21954)
*Mykola Haltiuk,Aleksander Smywiński-Pohl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MATT是一种模型感知的分词器迁移方法，通过注意力影响建模将源模型的token间通信模式蒸馏到使用新分词器的目标模型中，实现高效的多语言LLM适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分词器迁移方法依赖语义启发式初始化新嵌入，忽略了高层模型动态，限制了迁移质量。需要一种能利用模型内部信号的方法来改进低资源或不同文字语言的适应。

Method: 提出模型感知分词器迁移(MATT)，引入注意力影响建模(AIM)目标，将源模型的token间通信模式蒸馏到使用新分词器的目标模型中，为标准语言建模提供高效预热。

Result: 在多样化语言设置下的实验表明，MATT在几个GPU小时内恢复了原始模型的大部分性能，优于启发式基线方法。

Conclusion: 利用模型级信号为多语言LLM中的稳健分词器迁移提供了实用有效的路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained to support an increasing number of
languages, yet their predefined tokenizers remain a bottleneck for adapting
models to lower-resource or distinct-script languages. Existing tokenizer
transfer methods typically rely on semantic heuristics to initialize new
embeddings, ignoring higher-layer model dynamics and limiting transfer quality.
We propose Model-Aware Tokenizer Transfer (MATT), a method that incorporates
model internals into the tokenizer transfer process. MATT introduces an
Attention Influence Modeling (AIM) objective that distills inter-token
communication patterns from a source model into a target model with a new
tokenizer, providing an efficient warm-up before standard language modeling.
Unlike approaches that focus solely on embedding similarity, MATT leverages
attention behavior to guide embedding initialization and adaptation.
Experiments across diverse linguistic settings show that MATT recovers a large
fraction of the original model's performance within a few GPU hours,
outperforming heuristic baselines. These results demonstrate that incorporating
model-level signals offers a practical and effective path toward robust
tokenizer transfer in multilingual LLMs.

TL;DR: 使用GPT-2模型通过训练特定作者的作品来识别作者写作风格，能够准确区分不同作者的文本，并成功验证了《绿野仙踪》系列第15本书的真实作者身份。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型是否能够捕捉和识别不同作者的独特写作风格，为作者身份识别提供新的技术方法。

Method: 为每位作者单独训练GPT-2模型，通过比较模型对作者本人作品与其他作者作品的预测准确率来识别写作风格。

Result: 模型能够准确区分八位不同作者的写作风格，并成功确认了《绿野仙踪》系列第15本书的真实作者是R. P. Thompson而非F. L. Baum。

Conclusion: GPT-2模型能够有效捕捉作者的独特写作风格，为作者身份识别提供了可靠的技术手段。

Abstract: We show that large language models (LLMs) can be used to distinguish the
writings of different authors. Specifically, an individual GPT-2 model, trained
from scratch on the works of one author, will predict held-out text from that
author more accurately than held-out text from other authors. We suggest that,
in this way, a model trained on one author's works embodies the unique writing
style of that author. We first demonstrate our approach on books written by
eight different (known) authors. We also use this approach to confirm R. P.
Thompson's authorship of the well-studied 15th book of the Oz series,
originally attributed to F. L. Baum.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究很少关注影响LLM对越狱攻击敏感性的语言学和心理学机制，作者希望通过跨学科方法探索说服理论在LLM安全漏洞中的作用。

Method: 借鉴社会科学中成熟的说服策略，制作具有说服结构的对抗性提示，并在多个对齐LLM上进行实证评估。

Result: 实验表明，具有说服意识的提示能显著绕过安全防护措施，诱导LLM产生越狱行为，且不同LLM在越狱响应中展现出独特的说服特征。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了跨学科洞察在应对LLM安全挑战中的重要性，说服理论可有效揭示和利用LLM的安全漏洞。

Abstract: Despite recent advances, Large Language Models remain vulnerable to jailbreak
attacks that bypass alignment safeguards and elicit harmful outputs. While
prior research has proposed various attack strategies differing in human
readability and transferability, little attention has been paid to the
linguistic and psychological mechanisms that may influence a model's
susceptibility to such attacks. In this paper, we examine an interdisciplinary
line of research that leverages foundational theories of persuasion from the
social sciences to craft adversarial prompts capable of circumventing alignment
constraints in LLMs. Drawing on well-established persuasive strategies, we
hypothesize that LLMs, having been trained on large-scale human-generated text,
may respond more compliantly to prompts with persuasive structures.
Furthermore, we investigate whether LLMs themselves exhibit distinct persuasive
fingerprints that emerge in their jailbreak responses. Empirical evaluations
across multiple aligned LLMs reveal that persuasion-aware prompts significantly
bypass safeguards, demonstrating their potential to induce jailbreak behaviors.
This work underscores the importance of cross-disciplinary insight in
addressing the evolving challenges of LLM safety. The code and data are
available.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了离散优化越狱攻击在大型语言模型中的可转移性，识别了三个与转移成功强相关的统计属性，并发现提示语义相似性仅弱相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管越狱攻击的可转移性已被经验证实，但缺乏对其发生时机和原因的严格分析。

Method: 通过识别三个统计属性（无后缀提示激活拒绝方向的程度、后缀诱导远离拒绝方向的强度、正交方向的偏移大小）来分析可转移性。

Result: 发现这三个统计属性与转移成功强相关，而提示语义相似性仅弱相关。通过干预实验展示了统计分析如何转化为攻击成功的实际改进。

Conclusion: 研究提供了对可转移性的更细致理解，并展示了如何利用统计分析来实际提升越狱攻击的成功率。

Abstract: Discrete optimization-based jailbreaking attacks on large language models aim
to generate short, nonsensical suffixes that, when appended onto input prompts,
elicit disallowed content. Notably, these suffixes are often transferable --
succeeding on prompts and models for which they were never optimized. And yet,
despite the fact that transferability is surprising and empirically
well-established, the field lacks a rigorous analysis of when and why transfer
occurs. To fill this gap, we identify three statistical properties that
strongly correlate with transfer success across numerous experimental settings:
(1) how much a prompt without a suffix activates a model's internal refusal
direction, (2) how strongly a suffix induces a push away from this direction,
and (3) how large these shifts are in directions orthogonal to refusal. On the
other hand, we find that prompt semantic similarity only weakly correlates with
transfer success. These findings lead to a more fine-grained understanding of
transferability, which we use in interventional experiments to showcase how our
statistical analysis can translate into practical improvements in attack
success.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了机器翻译质量评估(QE)指标中的长度偏见问题，发现QE指标会随着翻译长度增加而过度预测错误，并偏好较短翻译，提出了长度归一化和引入参考文本两种缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质量评估指标在机器翻译的无参考评估和强化学习等任务中至关重要，但长度偏见的影响尚未得到充分探索，存在不公平惩罚较长正确翻译和导致次优决策的风险。

Method: 对10种不同语言对上的回归基和LLM-as-a-Judge QE指标进行系统研究，识别两种关键长度偏见，并提出长度归一化训练和评估时引入参考文本两种缓解策略。

Result: 研究发现QE指标确实存在系统性长度偏见：随着翻译长度增加会过度预测错误，即使对高质量无错误文本也是如此；同时偏好较短翻译。提出的两种策略都能有效减少这种偏见。

Conclusion: QE指标存在显著的长度偏见问题，需要通过长度归一化和参考文本引入等策略来缓解，以确保公平评估和优化决策。

Abstract: Quality Estimation (QE) metrics are vital in machine translation for
reference-free evaluation and as a reward signal in tasks like reinforcement
learning. However, the prevalence and impact of length bias in QE have been
underexplored. Through a systematic study of top-performing regression-based
and LLM-as-a-Judge QE metrics across 10 diverse language pairs, we reveal two
critical length biases: First, QE metrics consistently over-predict errors with
increasing translation length, even for high-quality, error-free texts. Second,
they exhibit a preference for shorter translations when multiple candidates are
available for the same source text. These inherent length biases risk unfairly
penalizing longer, correct translations and can lead to sub-optimal
decision-making in applications such as QE reranking and QE guided
reinforcement learning. To mitigate this, we propose two strategies: (a)
applying length normalization during model training, and (b) incorporating
reference texts during evaluation. Both approaches were found to effectively
reduce the identified length bias.

Result: ATLAS在样本外泛化性能上比现有缩放定律平均提高0.3 R²以上；推导出跨语言迁移矩阵，测量了1444对语言间的相互受益分数；建立了语言无关的缩放定律；确定了从头训练与从多语言检查点微调的计算交叉点。

Conclusion: 这些发现为跨语言民主化缩放定律提供了科学基础，使从业者能够高效扩展模型，超越英语优先的AI。

Abstract: Scaling laws research has focused overwhelmingly on English -- yet the most
prominent AI models explicitly serve billions of international users. In this
work, we undertake the largest multilingual scaling laws study to date,
totaling 774 multilingual training experiments, spanning 10M-8B model
parameters, 400+ training languages and 48 evaluation languages. We introduce
the Adaptive Transfer Scaling Law (ATLAS) for both monolingual and multilingual
pretraining, which outperforms existing scaling laws' out-of-sample
generalization often by more than 0.3 R^2. Our analyses of the experiments shed
light on multilingual learning dynamics, transfer properties between languages,
and the curse of multilinguality. First, we derive a cross-lingual transfer
matrix, empirically measuring mutual benefit scores between 38 x 38=1444
language pairs. Second, we derive a language-agnostic scaling law that reveals
how to optimally scale model size and data when adding languages without
sacrificing performance. Third, we identify the computational crossover points
for when to pretrain from scratch versus finetune from multilingual
checkpoints. We hope these findings provide the scientific foundation for
democratizing scaling laws across languages, and enable practitioners to
efficiently scale models -- beyond English-first AI.

### [16] [Emotions Where Art Thou: Understanding and Characterizing the Emotional Latent Space of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22042)

TL;DR: 该研究分析了LLM内部如何表示情感，发现存在低维情感流形，情感表征具有方向性编码、跨层分布的特点，且与可解释维度对齐。这些结构在不同深度保持稳定，并能泛化到多种语言的情感数据集。

Motivation: 探究大型语言模型内部如何表示和处理情感，理解其情感表征的几何结构和可操作性。

Method: 分析LLM隐藏状态空间的几何结构，识别低维情感流形，研究情感表征的方向性编码和跨层分布特性，并使用学习到的干预模块进行情感操控。

Result: 发现LLM中存在一致的情感几何结构，情感表征在跨语言数据集上表现出强泛化能力，线性探测性能优异，表明存在通用的情感子空间。通过干预模块可以有效操控内部情感感知而不影响语义。

Conclusion: LLM内部存在一致且可操控的情感几何结构，这为理解模型如何内化和处理情感提供了重要见解。

Abstract: This work investigates how large language models (LLMs) internally represent
emotion by analyzing the geometry of their hidden-state space. The paper
identifies a low-dimensional emotional manifold and shows that emotional
representations are directionally encoded, distributed across layers, and
aligned with interpretable dimensions. These structures are stable across depth
and generalize to eight real-world emotion datasets spanning five languages.
Cross-domain alignment yields low error and strong linear probe performance,
indicating a universal emotional subspace. Within this space, internal emotion
perception can be steered while preserving semantics using a learned
intervention module, with especially strong control for basic emotions across
languages. These findings reveal a consistent and manipulable affective
geometry in LLMs and offer insight into how they internalize and process
emotion.

### [17] [Compositional Bias Control in Large Language Models: Preference Learning Fails, Supervision Succeeds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22084)
*Atij Mahesh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 比较六种偏见缓解技术的效果，发现监督微调(SFT)在遵守约束和词汇多样性方面表现最佳，而基于偏好的方法(如DPO)无法满足组合约束要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型即使在职业中性语境中仍会产生性别刻板印象语言，现有偏见缓解方法的比较效果和学习动态尚不明确。

Method: 比较分析六种偏见控制技术：仅提示、生成过滤、Ctrl-G解码、监督微调、直接偏好优化和迭代零空间投影，在组合约束任务上评估约束遵守度、词汇多样性和流畅性。

Result: SFT达到99.87%的约束遵守率和高度词汇多样性，DPO仅4.53%遵守率。Ctrl-G保证完美遵守但牺牲流畅性和多样性。基于偏好的方法无法满足组合约束。

Conclusion: 只有明确的正面监督能缓解组合偏见，偏好学习无法泛化逻辑结构，强调显式监督对于公平流畅控制生成的必要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) still produce gender-stereotyped language even
in occupation-neutral contexts that reflect deep societal biases (Rudinger et
al., 2018). To address this, prior work has proposed prompting, constrained
decoding (Dathathri et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2024), post-processing, and
fine-tuning-based alignment (Rafailov et al., 2023; Ravfogel et al., 2022).
However, the comparative efficacy and learning dynamics remain little
understood. We report a comparative analysis of six control techniques for bias
mitigation: prompt-only, generate-and-filter, DFA-based Ctrl-G decoding,
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and
Iterative Nullspace Projection (INLP). We evaluate each method on a
compositional constraint task. This task requires generating sentences that
contain at least one agentic and one communal descriptor for each of the twenty
Winogender-derived occupations. We quantify trade-offs between control strength
and naturalness with evaluations of constraint compliance, lexical diversity,
and fluency. Our results reveal key contrasts among the methods: SFT achieves
99.87 +- 0.15% compliance and high lexical diversity, while DPO, despite
similar training stability, fails at 4.53 +- 0.82%. Ctrl-G guarantees perfect
compliance, but at the cost of severely reduced fluency and diversity.
Preference-based learning fundamentally differs: it cannot satisfy
compositional constraints, as binary preference signals encode ranking, not
logical conjunctions. Only explicit positive supervision enables mitigation of
compositional biases; preference-based alignment fails to generalize logical
structures, underscoring the limitations of preference learning and the
necessity of explicit supervision for fair and fluent controlled generation.

### [18] [Generalization or Memorization: Dynamic Decoding for Mode Steering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22099)
*Xuanming Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一个统一框架来理解和控制LLM的泛化与记忆模式，基于信息瓶颈理论开发动态模式引导算法，在推理时引导模型偏向泛化电路，提升逻辑一致性和事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM存在双重性：既能显著泛化，又会逐字记忆训练数据，这种不可预测性在高风险应用中影响可靠性。

Method: 基于信息瓶颈理论建立理论模型，开发动态模式引导算法，包含轻量级因果线性探针和动态激活引导机制，作为自适应自对比解码形式。

Result: 在推理和忠实性任务上的实验表明，DMS显著改善了逻辑一致性和事实准确性。

Conclusion: DMS为增强LLM可靠性提供了一种原则性方法，能够有效控制模型的泛化与记忆模式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a troubling duality, capable of both
remarkable generalization and brittle, verbatim memorization of their training
data. This unpredictability undermines their reliability in high-stakes
applications. In this work, we propose a unified framework to understand,
identify, and control these distinct reasoning modes. First, we introduce a
theoretical model based on the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle,
formalizing generalization as the learning of a compressed, task-relevant
representation and memorization as a failure to compress. Building on this
theory, we develop Dynamic Mode Steering (DMS), a novel inference-time
algorithm which comprises two components: (1) a lightweight, causally-grounded
linear probe that identifies the model's instantaneous reliance on
memorization, and (2) a dynamic activation steering mechanism that nudges the
model's computation towards pre-identified generalization circuits. We frame
DMS as a form of adaptive, self-contrastive decoding. Experiments on reasoning
and faithfulness tasks demonstrate that DMS significantly improves logical
consistency and factual accuracy, thereby offering a principled approach to
enhancing LLM reliability.

*Billy Dickson,Zoran Tiganj*

TL;DR: 提出一种通过输入令牌的对数压缩而非修改Transformer架构来处理长上下文的方法，在WikiText-103和PG-19基准测试中降低了困惑度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长上下文处理方法通常通过集成循环或辅助记忆模块来增加Transformer内部架构的复杂性，本文寻求一种替代方法。

Method: 受人类记忆认知模型启发，对输入令牌应用尺度不变的对数压缩，使用标准未修改的Transformer处理压缩后的表示。

Result: 在WikiText-103和PG-19语言建模基准测试中，相比未压缩基线降低了困惑度，且随着压缩时间上下文变长，性能持续提升。

Conclusion: 输入级别的对数压缩是扩展Transformer长程记忆的简单有效方法，同时保持了架构的简洁性。

Abstract: Most approaches to long-context processing increase the complexity of the
transformer's internal architecture by integrating mechanisms such as
recurrence or auxiliary memory modules. In this work, we introduce an
alternative approach that modifies the input representation itself, rather than
the transformer architecture. Inspired by cognitive models of human memory, our
method applies a scale-invariant logarithmic compression to the input tokens.
The resulting compressed representation is processed by a standard, unmodified
transformer, preserving architectural simplicity. We evaluate this approach on
the WikiText-103 and PG-19 language modeling benchmarks, showing a reduction in
perplexity compared to uncompressed baselines. Moreover, performance improves
consistently with longer compressed temporal contexts, showing that input-level
logarithmic compression is a simple and effective way to extend a transformer's
long-range memory.

Motivation: 构建一个能够从数百亿参数扩展到万亿参数的统一推理导向语言基础模型，通过稀疏激活机制实现推理能力与计算效率的最佳平衡。

Method: 采用高稀疏MoE架构，结合推理导向数据、思维链激活、强化学习微调(DFT、Evo-CoT)，以及全尺度FP8训练和细粒度异构流水线。

Result: Ling-1T在万亿参数规模上建立了推理准确性与计算效率的新帕累托边界，稀疏激活与推理目标对齐实现了可扩展且高效的人工智能。

Conclusion: Ling 2.0为推进未来推理和思维模型提供了一个连贯、开放且高效的基础，包括基于相同基础的Ring系列模型。

Abstract: We introduce Ling 2.0, a series reasoning-oriented language foundation built
upon the principle that every activation boosts reasoning capability. Designed
to scale from tens of billions to one trillion parameters under a unified
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm, Ling 2.0 emphasizes high sparsity,
cross-scale consistency, and efficiency guided by empirical scaling laws. The
series includes three non-thinking (instruct) models - Ling-mini-2.0,
Ling-flash-2.0, and Ling-1T - ranging from 16B to 1T total parameters and
achieving up to 7-fold active-compute efficiency compared with dense
counterparts. Ling 2.0 integrates coordinated innovations across model
architecture, pre-training, post-training, and infrastructure: a high-sparsity
MoE with MTP for efficient reasoning, reasoning-oriented data and mid-training
CoT activation, reinforcement-based fine-tuning (DFT, Evo-CoT), and full-scale
FP8 training with fine-grained heterogeneous pipelines. At the trillion scale,
Ling-1T establishes a new Pareto frontier of reasoning accuracy versus
computational efficiency, demonstrating that sparse activation, when properly
aligned with reasoning objectives, enables scalable and efficient intelligence.
Collectively, Ling 2.0 provides a coherent, open, and efficient foundation for
advancing future reasoning and thinking models, including the Ring series built
upon the same base.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于RAG的智能客服系统存在幻觉问题和机械式响应，这带来了业务风险并影响用户体验，特别是在Web客服交互场景中

Method: 采用两阶段方法：Learn-to-Think阶段学习人类专家的推理过程和响应策略，Learn-to-Respond阶段结合冷启动监督微调(SFT)和强化学习(RL)进行基础到困难的自优化

Result: 在工业级社交客服环境中进行大规模在线A/B测试，在社区支持/直播互动场景中分别实现智能解决率+28.92%/+18.42%和人工接管率-6.08%/-7.12%的显著提升

Conclusion: OlaMind框架在多样化真实应用场景中展现出持续有效性，显著增强了类人化和自然度，同时有效缓解了幻觉和关键业务风险

Abstract: Intelligent customer service (ICS) systems via retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) have been widely adopted in Web-based domains such as social platforms
and e-commerce, achieving remarkable improvements in automation and efficiency.
However, notable limitations still remain: these systems are prone to
hallucinations and often generate rigid, mechanical responses, which can
introduce business risks and undermine user experience, especially in Web-based
customer service interactions under the RAG scenarios. In this paper, we
introduce OlaMind, a human-like and hallucination-safe customer service
framework for retrieval-augmented dialogue. Specifically, it first leverages a
Learn-to-Think stage to learn the reasoning processes and response strategies
from human experts, and then employs a Learn-to-Respond stage to perform
cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) combined with reinforcement learning
(RL) for basic-to-hard self-refinement. Our method significantly enhances
human-likeness and naturalness while effectively mitigating hallucinations and
critical business risks. We have conducted large-scale online A/B experiments
in an industry-level social customer service setting, and extensive
experimental results show that OlaMind achieves significant cumulative relative
improvements with intelligent resolution rates +28.92%/+18.42% and human
takeover rate -6.08%/-7.12% in community-support/livestream-interaction
scenarios, respectively, which highlights its consistent effectiveness across
diverse real-world applications. The code and data will be publicly available.

TL;DR: 为低资源语言迈蒂利语创建首个可解释情感分析基准数据集，包含3,221个带有情感极性和自然语言解释的句子。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 迈蒂利语作为拥有1300万使用者的印度-雅利安语言，在自然语言处理研究中代表性不足，缺乏细粒度标注和可解释性机制的情感分析资源。

Method: 引入包含3,221个迈蒂利语句子的新数据集，每个句子都标注了情感极性和自然语言解释，并由语言专家精心策划和验证以确保标签可靠性和上下文保真度。

Result: 使用经典机器学习和最先进的transformer架构进行的广泛实验证明了该数据集在可解释情感分析方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为迈蒂利语建立了首个可解释情感计算基准，为多语言NLP和可解释AI的广泛发展贡献了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Developing benchmark datasets for low-resource languages poses significant
challenges, primarily due to the limited availability of native linguistic
experts and the substantial time and cost involved in annotation. Given these
challenges, Maithili is still underrepresented in natural language processing
research. It is an Indo-Aryan language spoken by more than 13 million people in
the Purvanchal region of India, valued for its rich linguistic structure and
cultural significance. While sentiment analysis has achieved remarkable
progress in high-resource languages, resources for low-resource languages, such
as Maithili, remain scarce, often restricted to coarse-grained annotations and
lacking interpretability mechanisms. To address this limitation, we introduce a
novel dataset comprising 3,221 Maithili sentences annotated for sentiment
polarity and accompanied by natural language justifications. Moreover, the
dataset is carefully curated and validated by linguistic experts to ensure both
label reliability and contextual fidelity. Notably, the justifications are
written in Maithili, thereby promoting culturally grounded interpretation and
enhancing the explainability of sentiment models. Furthermore, extensive
experiments using both classical machine learning and state-of-the-art
transformer architectures demonstrate the dataset's effectiveness for
interpretable sentiment analysis. Ultimately, this work establishes the first
benchmark for explainable affective computing in Maithili, thus contributing a
valuable resource to the broader advancement of multilingual NLP and
explainable AI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DETECT，首个德语专用的文本简化评估指标，通过LLM生成合成质量分数，在简单性、意义保留和流畅性三个维度上全面评估德语ATS质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前德语自动文本简化评估依赖通用指标如SARI、BLEU和BERTScore，这些指标无法充分捕捉简化质量。由于缺乏人工标注语料库，德语专用评估指标发展滞后。

Method: 将LENS框架适配到德语，并扩展了：(i) 通过LLM生成合成质量分数的流程，无需人工标注即可创建数据集；(ii) 基于LLM的细化步骤，使评分标准与简化要求对齐。还构建了最大的德语人工评估数据集进行验证。

Result: DETECT在人类判断相关性方面显著优于广泛使用的ATS指标，在意义保留和流畅性方面提升尤其明显。

Conclusion: DETECT填补了德语ATS评估的空白，同时揭示了LLM在自动评估中的潜力和局限性，为通用语言可访问性任务提供了可转移的指导原则。

Abstract: Current evaluation of German automatic text simplification (ATS) relies on
general-purpose metrics such as SARI, BLEU, and BERTScore, which insufficiently
capture simplification quality in terms of simplicity, meaning preservation,
and fluency. While specialized metrics like LENS have been developed for
English, corresponding efforts for German have lagged behind due to the absence
of human-annotated corpora. To close this gap, we introduce DETECT, the first
German-specific metric that holistically evaluates ATS quality across all three
dimensions of simplicity, meaning preservation, and fluency, and is trained
entirely on synthetic large language model (LLM) responses. Our approach adapts
the LENS framework to German and extends it with (i) a pipeline for generating
synthetic quality scores via LLMs, enabling dataset creation without human
annotation, and (ii) an LLM-based refinement step for aligning grading criteria
with simplification requirements. To the best of our knowledge, we also
construct the largest German human evaluation dataset for text simplification
to validate our metric directly. Experimental results show that DETECT achieves
substantially higher correlations with human judgments than widely used ATS
metrics, with particularly strong gains in meaning preservation and fluency.
Beyond ATS, our findings highlight both the potential and the limitations of
LLMs for automatic evaluation and provide transferable guidelines for general
language accessibility tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种测量LLM在成对文本比较中输出错误率的方法，该方法不依赖真实标签，支持均匀错误率和二元位置偏差两种场景，并通过Copeland计数构建文本排名来估计错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测量LLM在成对文本比较任务中的错误概率，了解其偏好判断的可靠性，特别是位置偏差对比较结果的影响。

Method: 使用两种比较场景：(i)均匀错误率，通过每个文本对进行两次比较来估计；(ii)二元位置偏差，假设两种比较顺序有不同错误率，通过重复比较来估计。采用Copeland计数从成对偏好构建文本排名。

Result: 在六个LLM（ChatGPT、Claude、DeepSeek、Gemini、Grok、Qwen）和五种文本输入类型上的实验显示，测量的两个位置偏差项相似，接近均匀错误。Claude在错误率和提示变化鲁棒性方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: 该方法在指示LLM在成对比较任务中的错误方面优于有偏Bradley-Terry模型和交换性评分，揭示了LLM基于成对比较的扩展性较差问题。

Abstract: We measure LLMs' output error at pairwise text comparison, noting the
probability of error in their preferences. Our method does not rely on the
ground truth and supports two scenarios: (i) uniform error rate regardless of
the order of comparison, estimated with two comparisons for each text pair with
either text placed first; (ii) binary positional bias assuming distinct error
rates for the two orders of comparison, estimated with repeated comparisons
between the texts. The Copeland counting constructs a ranking over the compared
texts from pairwise preferences; the ranking reveals the poor scalability of
LLM-based pairwise comparison and helps yield the estimates for LLMs' error
rates. We apply the method to six LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini,
Grok, Qwen) with five types of text input and obtain consistent estimates of
LLMs' error. In general, the measured two positional bias terms are similar,
close to the uniform error. Considering both the error rates and the robustness
to the variation of prompts, Claude obtained the most desirable performance in
this experiment. Our model outperforms the biased Bradley-Terry model and the
commutativity score in indicating LLMs' error at this task.

TL;DR: 本文分析了Swadesh方法在语言年代学中的局限性，指出即使所有基本假设都满足，数学上仍存在估计准确性的限制，并提出了考虑词汇渐进修改过程可以提高时间分离估计的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Swadesh方法在语言年代学中广泛应用，但其基本假设往往不现实，且即使假设成立，数学上仍存在估计准确性的固有局限。本文旨在揭示这些被忽视的概率限制，并探索提高估计精度的方法。

Method: 通过数学分析Swadesh方法的概率限制，并引入词汇渐进修改这一随机过程，从概率角度分析其对语言词汇演变的影响。

Result: 发现Swadesh方法存在固有的概率限制，即使所有假设都满足也无法完全准确。同时证明词汇渐进修改过程对语言词汇演变有重要贡献，考虑这一过程可以显著提高时间分离估计的精度。

Conclusion: Swadesh方法在语言年代学中存在固有的概率限制，而考虑词汇渐进修改过程可以改善估计精度，这对语言年代学研究具有重要意义。

Abstract: The Swadesh approach for determining the temporal separation between two
languages relies on the stochastic process of words replacement (when a
complete new word emerges to represent a given concept). It is well known that
the basic assumptions of the Swadesh approach are often unrealistic due to
various contamination phenomena and misjudgments (horizontal transfers,
variations over time and space of the replacement rate, incorrect assessments
of cognacy relationships, presence of synonyms, and so on). All of this means
that the results cannot be completely correct.
  More importantly, even in the unrealistic case that all basic assumptions are
satisfied, simple mathematics places limits on the accuracy of estimating the
temporal separation between two languages. These limits, which are purely
probabilistic in nature and which are often neglected in lexicostatistical
studies, are analyzed in detail in this article.
  Furthermore, in this work we highlight that the evolution of a language's
lexicon is also driven by another stochastic process: gradual lexical
modification of words. We show that this process equally also represents a
major contribution to the reshaping of the vocabulary of languages over the
centuries and we also show, from a purely probabilistic perspective, that
taking into account this second random process significantly increases the
precision in determining the temporal separation between two languages.

TL;DR: Sculpting是一种基于规则的约束提示方法，旨在通过减少语义模糊和常识错误来改进标准CoT提示。研究发现存在"提示反转"现象：Sculpting在gpt-4o上有优势，但在gpt-5上反而有害，表明最佳提示策略需与模型能力共同演化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准CoT提示在LLM推理中存在语义模糊和常识错误的问题，需要开发更有效的提示方法来提升推理准确性。

Method: 提出"Sculpting"方法，这是一种受约束的、基于规则的提示方法，在GSM8K数学推理基准上评估了三种提示策略（Zero Shot、标准CoT、Sculpting）在三个OpenAI模型（gpt-4o-mini、gpt-4o、gpt-5）上的表现。

Result: 发现"提示反转"现象：Sculpting在gpt-4o上优于标准CoT（97% vs 93%），但在gpt-5上反而有害（94.00% vs 96.36%）。这是由于"护栏到手铐"的转变，约束在高级模型中引发过度字面化。

Conclusion: 最优提示策略必须与模型能力共同演化，对于更强大的模型，建议使用更简单的提示方法。

Abstract: Prompt engineering, particularly Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting,
significantly enhances LLM reasoning capabilities. We introduce "Sculpting," a
constrained, rule-based prompting method designed to improve upon standard CoT
by reducing errors from semantic ambiguity and flawed common sense.
  We evaluate three prompting strategies (Zero Shot, standard CoT, and
Sculpting) across three OpenAI model generations (gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o, gpt-5)
using the GSM8K mathematical reasoning benchmark (1,317 problems).
  Our findings reveal a "Prompting Inversion": Sculpting provides advantages on
gpt-4o (97% vs. 93% for standard CoT), but becomes detrimental on gpt-5 (94.00%
vs. 96.36% for CoT on full benchmark). We trace this to a
"Guardrail-to-Handcuff" transition where constraints preventing common-sense
errors in mid-tier models induce hyper-literalism in advanced models. Our
detailed error analysis demonstrates that optimal prompting strategies must
co-evolve with model capabilities, suggesting simpler prompts for more capable
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有激活引导方法使用所有历史数据计算引导向量，但并非所有内容都反映真实用户偏好，这会削弱个性化信号。

Method: 基于因果推断理论估计token级因果效应来识别偏好驱动token，将这些离散信号转化为连贯描述，然后用于引导个性化LLM生成。

Result: 在两个代表性引导骨干方法和真实数据集上的实验表明，SteerX持续提升引导向量质量。

Conclusion: SteerX通过关注真正偏好驱动信息，为更有效的LLM个性化提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success in recent years,
enabling a wide range of applications, including intelligent assistants that
support users' daily life and work. A critical factor in building such
assistants is personalizing LLMs, as user preferences and needs vary widely.
Activation steering, which directly leverages directions representing user
preference in the LLM activation space to adjust its behavior, offers a
cost-effective way to align the model's outputs with individual users. However,
existing methods rely on all historical data to compute the steering vector,
ignoring that not all content reflects true user preferences, which undermines
the personalization signal. To address this, we propose SteerX, a disentangled
steering method that isolates preference-driven components from
preference-agnostic components. Grounded in causal inference theory, SteerX
estimates token-level causal effects to identify preference-driven tokens,
transforms these discrete signals into a coherent description, and then
leverages them to steer personalized LLM generation. By focusing on the truly
preference-driven information, SteerX produces more accurate activation
steering vectors and enhances personalization. Experiments on two
representative steering backbone methods across real-world datasets demonstrate
that SteerX consistently enhances steering vector quality, offering a practical
solution for more effective LLM personalization.

*Iliass Ayaou,Denis Cavallucci*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了PatenTEB专利文本嵌入基准，包含15个任务和206万样本，并开发了patembed模型家族，在专利检索和聚类任务上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准无法充分捕捉专利特定挑战，需要专门的专利文本嵌入基准来支持专利检索、技术景观分析和专利分析。

Method: 采用领域分层分割、领域特定难负样本挖掘，覆盖非对称片段到文档匹配场景，通过多任务训练开发patembed模型家族（67M-344M参数）。

Result: patembed-base在MTEB BigPatentClustering.v2上达到0.494 V-measure（之前最佳为0.445），patembed-large在DAPFAM上达到0.377 NDCG@100。

Conclusion: 多任务训练能提升外部泛化能力，领域预训练初始化在所有任务家族中提供一致优势，所有资源将开源。

Abstract: Patent text embeddings enable prior art search, technology landscaping, and
patent analysis, yet existing benchmarks inadequately capture patent-specific
challenges. We introduce PatenTEB, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 15
tasks across retrieval, classification, paraphrase, and clustering, with 2.06
million examples. PatenTEB employs domain-stratified splits, domain specific
hard negative mining, and systematic coverage of asymmetric
fragment-to-document matching scenarios absent from general embedding
benchmarks. We develop the patembed model family through multi-task training,
spanning 67M to 344M parameters with context lengths up to 4096 tokens.
External validation shows strong generalization: patembed-base achieves
state-of-the-art on MTEB BigPatentClustering.v2 (0.494 V-measure vs. 0.445
previous best), while patembed-large achieves 0.377 NDCG@100 on DAPFAM.
Systematic ablations reveal that multi-task training improves external
generalization despite minor benchmark costs, and that domain-pretrained
initialization provides consistent advantages across task families. All
resources will be made available at https://github.com/iliass-y/patenteb.
Keywords: patent retrieval, sentence embeddings, multi-task learning,

*Tu Anh Dinh,Philipp Nicolas Schumacher,Jan Niehues*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究比较了RAG和CPT两种策略，发现在大学课程材料规模较小的情况下，RAG比CPT更有效且高效，多模态RAG（将幻灯片作为图像处理）显著优于纯文本检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在教育场景中支持学生学习，但在大学计算机科学课程中准确回答问题仍有困难，需要探索如何利用课程材料提升LLM表现。

Method: 比较两种策略：检索增强生成(RAG)和持续预训练(CPT)，对幻灯片进一步探索多模态RAG方法，将检索内容以图像形式呈现给生成器。

Result: RAG比CPT更有效高效，多模态RAG显著优于纯文本检索，幻灯片作为图像处理能显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 这些发现为开发更好支持学习和教学的AI助手提供了实用策略，可激励其他教育场景的类似努力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years. One
application of LLMs is to support student learning in educational settings.
However, prior work has shown that LLMs still struggle to answer questions
accurately within university-level computer science courses. In this work, we
investigate how incorporating university course materials can enhance LLM
performance in this setting. A key challenge lies in leveraging diverse course
materials such as lecture slides and transcripts, which differ substantially
from typical textual corpora: slides also contain visual elements like images
and formulas, while transcripts contain spoken, less structured language. We
compare two strategies, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Continual
Pre-Training (CPT), to extend LLMs with course-specific knowledge. For lecture
slides, we further explore a multi-modal RAG approach, where we present the
retrieved content to the generator in image form. Our experiments reveal that,
given the relatively small size of university course materials, RAG is more
effective and efficient than CPT. Moreover, incorporating slides as images in
the multi-modal setting significantly improves performance over text-only
retrieval. These findings highlight practical strategies for developing AI
assistants that better support learning and teaching, and we hope they inspire
similar efforts in other educational contexts.

### [30] [Supervised Fine-Tuning or In-Context Learning? Evaluating LLMs for Clinical NER](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22285)
*Andrei Baroian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 比较三种临床命名实体识别方法：BERT类编码器、GPT-4o的少样本上下文学习以及GPT-4o的监督微调，发现监督微调效果最佳但成本较高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同方法在临床命名实体识别任务上的表现，特别是比较传统BERT模型与大型语言模型在医疗领域的应用效果。

Method: 使用CADEC语料库，评估三类方法：(i) BERT类编码器（BERT Base、BioClinicalBERT、RoBERTa-large），(ii) GPT-4o的少样本上下文学习（简单vs复杂提示），(iii) GPT-4o的监督微调。

Result: RoBERTa-large和BioClinicalBERT相比BERT Base提升有限；简单提示的上下文学习优于复杂提示；监督微调达到最佳性能（F1≈87.1%），但成本较高；LLM在简化任务（二分类）上表现更好。

Conclusion: 监督微调在临床NER任务中表现最佳，但需权衡成本；简单提示优于复杂提示；传统BERT模型的改进空间有限。

Abstract: We study clinical Named Entity Recognition (NER) on the CADEC corpus and
compare three families of approaches: (i) BERT-style encoders (BERT Base,
BioClinicalBERT, RoBERTa-large), (ii) GPT-4o used with few-shot in-context
learning (ICL) under simple vs.\ complex prompts, and (iii) GPT-4o with
supervised fine-tuning (SFT). All models are evaluated on standard NER metrics
over CADEC's five entity types (ADR, Drug, Disease, Symptom, Finding).
RoBERTa-large and BioClinicalBERT offer limited improvements over BERT Base,
showing the limit of these family of models. Among LLM settings, simple ICL
outperforms a longer, instruction-heavy prompt, and SFT achieves the strongest
overall performance (F1 $\approx$ 87.1%), albeit with higher cost. We find that
the LLM achieve higher accuracy on simplified tasks, restricting classification
to two labels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 寻求比深度神经网络更高效、更环保的语言建模方法，减少训练和推理过程中的生态足迹。

Method: 实现基于记忆的语言建模，使用k近邻分类的快速近似方法，完全依赖CPU运行，实现低延迟。

Result: 与GPT-2和GPT-Neo相比，在下一个token预测准确率、排放估计和速度方面表现良好。

Conclusion: 基于记忆的语言建模是一种简单透明、生态友好的语言建模替代方案。

Abstract: We present memory-based language modeling as an efficient, eco-friendly
alternative to deep neural network-based language modeling. It offers
log-linearly scalable next-token prediction performance and strong memorization
capabilities. Implementing fast approximations of k-nearest neighbor
classification, memory-based language modeling leaves a relatively small
ecological footprint both in training and in inference mode, as it relies fully
on CPUs and attains low token latencies. Its internal workings are simple and
fully transparent. We compare our implementation of memory-based language
modeling, OLIFANT, with GPT-2 and GPT-Neo on next-token prediction accuracy,
estimated emissions and speeds, and offer some deeper analyses of the model.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个多语言目标立场提取(TSE)基准，涵盖加泰罗尼亚语、爱沙尼亚语、法语、意大利语、中文和西班牙语，无需为每种语言单独训练模型，F1得分为12.78，突显了多语言任务的挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体数据可用于分析争议性问题的公众意见，但现有的目标立场提取研究仅限于英语，缺乏多语言基准。

Method: 将原始TSE流程扩展到多语言设置，使用统一的模型管道处理多种语言，无需为每种语言单独训练模型。

Result: 模型在多语言TSE任务上获得12.78的F1分数，表明多语言任务比英语任务更具挑战性，目标预测是主要瓶颈。

Conclusion: 这项工作为多语言TSE提供了急需的基准，包括资源、算法和评估标准，并首次展示了TSE的F1分数对不同目标表述的敏感性。

Abstract: Social media enables data-driven analysis of public opinion on contested
issues. Target-Stance Extraction (TSE) is the task of identifying the target
discussed in a document and the document's stance towards that target. Many
works classify stance towards a given target in a multilingual setting, but all
prior work in TSE is English-only. This work introduces the first multilingual
TSE benchmark, spanning Catalan, Estonian, French, Italian, Mandarin, and
Spanish corpora. It manages to extend the original TSE pipeline to a
multilingual setting without requiring separate models for each language. Our
model pipeline achieves a modest F1 score of 12.78, underscoring the increased
difficulty of the multilingual task relative to English-only setups and
highlighting target prediction as the primary bottleneck. We are also the first
to demonstrate the sensitivity of TSE's F1 score to different target
verbalizations. Together these serve as a much-needed baseline for resources,
algorithms, and evaluation criteria in multilingual TSE.

*Mohammad Aghajani Asl,Majid Asgari-Bidhendi,Behrooz Minaei-Bidgoli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FAIR-RAG是一个新型的代理框架，通过结构化证据评估和迭代优化机制，解决了复杂多跳查询中证据不完整的问题，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG框架在处理需要从不同来源综合信息的复杂多跳查询时表现不佳，缺乏系统识别和填补证据空白的机制，容易传播噪音或无法收集全面上下文。

Method: FAIR-RAG将标准RAG流程转变为动态的证据驱动推理过程，核心是结构化证据评估(SEA)模块，通过分解查询为所需发现清单，识别已确认事实和明确信息缺口，然后由自适应查询优化代理生成针对性子查询来检索缺失信息。

Result: 在HotpotQA、2WikiMultiHopQA和MusiQue等挑战性多跳QA基准测试中，FAIR-RAG显著优于强基线。在HotpotQA上达到0.453的F1分数，比最强迭代基线绝对提升8.3分，建立了该类方法的新最先进水平。

Conclusion: 具有明确缺口分析的结构化证据驱动优化过程对于在复杂知识密集型任务中实现可靠准确的推理至关重要。

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucination and
knowledge staleness in Large Language Models (LLMs), existing frameworks often
falter on complex, multi-hop queries that require synthesizing information from
disparate sources. Current advanced RAG methods, employing iterative or
adaptive strategies, lack a robust mechanism to systematically identify and
fill evidence gaps, often propagating noise or failing to gather a
comprehensive context. We introduce FAIR-RAG, a novel agentic framework that
transforms the standard RAG pipeline into a dynamic, evidence-driven reasoning
process. At its core is an Iterative Refinement Cycle governed by a module we
term Structured Evidence Assessment (SEA). The SEA acts as an analytical gating
mechanism: it deconstructs the initial query into a checklist of required
findings and audits the aggregated evidence to identify confirmed facts and,
critically, explicit informational gaps. These gaps provide a precise signal to
an Adaptive Query Refinement agent, which generates new, targeted sub-queries
to retrieve missing information. This cycle repeats until the evidence is
verified as sufficient, ensuring a comprehensive context for a final, strictly
faithful generation. We conducted experiments on challenging multi-hop QA
benchmarks, including HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and MusiQue. In a unified
experimental setup, FAIR-RAG significantly outperforms strong baselines. On
HotpotQA, it achieves an F1-score of 0.453 -- an absolute improvement of 8.3
points over the strongest iterative baseline -- establishing a new
state-of-the-art for this class of methods on these benchmarks. Our work
demonstrates that a structured, evidence-driven refinement process with
explicit gap analysis is crucial for unlocking reliable and accurate reasoning
in advanced RAG systems for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks.

Abstract: Ironic identification is a challenging task in Natural Language Processing,
particularly when dealing with languages that differ in syntax and cultural
context. In this work, we aim to detect irony in Urdu by translating an English
Ironic Corpus into the Urdu language. We evaluate ten state-of-the-art machine

detection. Among machine learning models, Gradient Boosting achieved the best
performance with an F1-score of 89.18%. Among transformer-based models, LLaMA 3
(8B) achieved the highest performance with an F1-score of 94.61%. These results
demonstrate that combining transliteration techniques with modern NLP models
enables robust irony detection in Urdu, a historically low-resource language.

Motivation: 可视化质量评估具有挑战性，需要同时考虑数据编码准确性、信息表达性和视觉美学，但目前缺乏系统性的基准测试来衡量MLLMs在这方面的能力。

Method: 构建包含3,090个专家标注样本的VisJudge-Bench基准测试，涵盖32种图表类型，并开发专门的可视化美学和质量评估模型VisJudge。

Result: 测试显示最先进的MLLMs（如GPT-5）与人类专家评估存在显著差距（MAE=0.551，相关性=0.429），而VisJudge将MAE降低至0.442（减少19.8%），与人类专家一致性提升至0.681（提高58.7%）。

Conclusion: VisJudge-Bench是首个全面的可视化质量评估基准，VisJudge模型显著缩小了与人类专家判断的差距，为可视化质量评估提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Visualization, a domain-specific yet widely used form of imagery, is an
effective way to turn complex datasets into intuitive insights, and its value
depends on whether data are faithfully represented, clearly communicated, and
aesthetically designed. However, evaluating visualization quality is
challenging: unlike natural images, it requires simultaneous judgment across
data encoding accuracy, information expressiveness, and visual aesthetics.
Although multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising
performance in aesthetic assessment of natural images, no systematic benchmark
exists for measuring their capabilities in evaluating visualizations. To
address this, we propose VisJudge-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark for
evaluating MLLMs' performance in assessing visualization aesthetics and
quality. It contains 3,090 expert-annotated samples from real-world scenarios,
covering single visualizations, multiple visualizations, and dashboards across
32 chart types. Systematic testing on this benchmark reveals that even the most
advanced MLLMs (such as GPT-5) still exhibit significant gaps compared to human
experts in judgment, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.551 and a
correlation with human ratings of only 0.429. To address this issue, we propose
VisJudge, a model specifically designed for visualization aesthetics and
quality assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that VisJudge
significantly narrows the gap with human judgment, reducing the MAE to 0.442 (a
19.8% reduction) and increasing the consistency with human experts to 0.681 (a
58.7% improvement) compared to GPT-5. The benchmark is available at

Conclusion: CAP数据集公开发布，旨在促进幻觉检测、LLMs多语言评估以及开发更可靠的科学NLP系统的先进研究。

Abstract: We introduce the CAP (Confabulations from ACL Publications) dataset, a
multilingual resource for studying hallucinations in large language models
(LLMs) within scientific text generation. CAP focuses on the scientific domain,
where hallucinations can distort factual knowledge, as they frequently do. In
this domain, however, the presence of specialized terminology, statistical
reasoning, and context-dependent interpretations further exacerbates these
distortions, particularly given LLMs' lack of true comprehension, limited
contextual understanding, and bias toward surface-level generalization. CAP
operates in a cross-lingual setting covering five high-resource languages
(English, French, Hindi, Italian, and Spanish) and four low-resource languages
(Bengali, Gujarati, Malayalam, and Telugu). The dataset comprises 900 curated
scientific questions and over 7000 LLM-generated answers from 16 publicly
available models, provided as question-answer pairs along with token sequences
and corresponding logits. Each instance is annotated with a binary label
indicating the presence of a scientific hallucination, denoted as a factuality
error, and a fluency label, capturing issues in the linguistic quality or
naturalness of the text. CAP is publicly released to facilitate advanced
research on hallucination detection, multilingual evaluation of LLMs, and the
development of more reliable scientific NLP systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 角色分配LLM中的人口统计扰动（如代词变化）会导致推理轨迹变化，产生不同的正确答案。与其将这些变化视为需要消除的偏见，不如将其作为提高推理鲁棒性的建设性资源

Method: 提出CHOIR框架，在反事实角色间进行协作解码，动态平衡推理路径中的一致性和分歧，将多个角色条件下的推理信号协调为统一预测

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，CHOIR持续提升了不同人口统计组、模型架构、规模和任务的性能，无需额外训练。对个体人口统计组的改进高达26.4%，五个人口统计组的平均改进为19.2%

Conclusion: 通过将角色变化重新定义为建设性信号，CHOIR为更可靠的LLM推理提供了可扩展和通用化的方法

Abstract: Persona-assigned Large Language Models (LLMs) can adopt diverse roles,
enabling personalized and context-aware reasoning. However, even minor
demographic perturbations in personas, such as simple pronoun changes, can
alter reasoning trajectories, leading to divergent sets of correct answers.
Instead of treating these variations as biases to be mitigated, we explore
their potential as a constructive resource to improve reasoning robustness. We
propose CHOIR (Collaborative Harmonization fOr Inference Robustness), a
test-time framework that harmonizes multiple persona-conditioned reasoning
signals into a unified prediction. CHOIR orchestrates a collaborative decoding
process among counterfactual personas, dynamically balancing agreement and
divergence in their reasoning paths. Experiments on various reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that CHOIR consistently enhances performance across
demographics, model architectures, scales, and tasks - without additional
training. Improvements reach up to 26.4% for individual demographic groups and
19.2% on average across five demographics. It remains effective even when base
personas are suboptimal. By reframing persona variation as a constructive
signal, CHOIR provides a scalable and generalizable approach to more reliable
LLM reasoning.

Motivation: 传统研究声调发生主要依赖比较重建和声学分析，本文旨在引入计算方法来量化音高在不同声调发生阶段的功能角色。

Method: 通过测量音高操作对自动语音识别性能的影响，分析一组密切相关的藏语方言对音平平坦化的敏感性。

Result: 发现声调发生连续体：无音调特征的安多方言对音高移除容忍度最高，完全有声调的卫藏方言显示严重性能下降，而中间的康方言处于两者之间。

Conclusion: 计算方法能够捕捉声音变化的细粒度阶段，传统的功能负载指标可能高估了过渡系统中音高的依赖性。

Abstract: Tonogenesis-the historical process by which segmental contrasts evolve into
lexical tone-has traditionally been studied through comparative reconstruction
and acoustic phonetics. We introduce a computational approach that quantifies
the functional role of pitch at different stages of this sound change by
measuring how pitch manipulation affects automatic speech recognition (ASR)
performance. Through analysis on the sensitivity to pitch-flattening from a set
of closely related Tibetan languages, we find evidence of a tonogenesis
continuum: atonal Amdo dialects tolerate pitch removal the most, while fully
tonal U-Tsang varieties show severe degradation, and intermediate Kham dialects
fall measurably between these extremes. These gradient effects demonstrate how
ASR models implicitly learn the shifting functional load of pitch as languages
transition from consonant-based to tone-based lexical contrasts. Our findings
show that computational methods can capture fine-grained stages of sound change
and suggest that traditional functional load metrics, based solely on minimal
pairs, may overestimate pitch dependence in transitional systems where
segmental and suprasegmental cues remain phonetically intertwined.

Abstract: Pruning provides a practical solution to reduce the resources required to run
large language models (LLMs) to benefit from their effective capabilities as
well as control their cost for training and inference. Research on LLM pruning
often ranks the importance of LLM parameters using their magnitudes and
calibration-data activations and removes (or masks) the less important ones,
accordingly reducing LLMs' size. However, these approaches primarily focus on
preserving the LLM's ability to generate fluent sentences, while neglecting
performance on specific domains and tasks. In this paper, we propose a simple
yet effective pruning approach for LLMs that preserves task-specific
capabilities while shrinking their parameter space. We first analyze how
conventional pruning minimizes loss perturbation under general-domain
calibration and extend this formulation by incorporating task-specific feature
distributions into the importance computation of existing pruning algorithms.
Thus, our framework computes separate importance scores using both general and
task-specific calibration data, partitions parameters into shared and exclusive
groups based on activation-norm differences, and then fuses their scores to
guide the pruning process. This design enables our method to integrate
seamlessly with various foundation pruning techniques and preserve the LLM's
specialized abilities under compression. Experiments on widely used benchmarks
demonstrate that our approach is effective and consistently outperforms the
baselines with identical pruning ratios and different settings.

Method: 通过记录Whisper在49种语言推理时的解码候选子词，跟踪它们随时间的累积发现情况，分析模型子词空间的利用模式。

Result: 发现子词总数与语言预训练小时数基本无关；子词发现率遵循一致的指数饱和模式；拉丁文字的语言比西里尔、CJK和闪米特文字表现更好；子词长度与资源水平呈正相关。

Conclusion: 多语言ASR推理中的子词利用更多受语言统计、类型和正字法结构约束，而非训练数据规模，为更公平的语料构建和跨语言评估提供了实证基础。

Abstract: How much audio is needed to fully observe a multilingual ASR model's learned
sub-token inventory across languages, and does data disparity in multilingual
pre-training affect how these tokens are utilized during inference? We address
this question by analyzing Whisper's decoding behavior during inference across
49 languages. By logging decoding candidate sub-tokens and tracking their
cumulative discovery over time, we study the utilization pattern of the model's
sub-token space. Results show that the total number of discovered tokens
remains largely independent of a language's pre-training hours, indicating that
data disparity does not strongly influence lexical diversity in the model's
hypothesis space. Sub-token discovery rates follow a consistent exponential
saturation pattern across languages, suggesting a stable time window after
which additional audio yields minimal new sub-token activation. We refer to
this convergence threshold as acoustic saturation time (AST). Further analyses
of rank-frequency distributions reveal Zipf-like patterns better modeled by a
Zipf-Mandelbrot law, and mean sub-token length shows a positive correlation
with resource level. Additionally, those metrics show more favorable patterns
for languages in the Latin script than those in scripts such as Cyrillic, CJK,
and Semitic. Together, our study suggests that sub-token utilization during
multilingual ASR inference is constrained more by the statistical, typological,
and orthographic structure of the speech than by training data scale, providing
an empirical basis for more equitable corpus construction and cross-lingual
evaluation.

### [42] [A Sociophonetic Analysis of Racial Bias in Commercial ASR Systems Using the Pacific Northwest English Corpus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22495)
*Michael Scott,Siyu Liang,Alicia Wassink,Gina-Anne Levow*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 对四个主流商业ASR系统进行种族偏见评估，发现语音质量变异（特别是低后元音合并和鼻前元音合并模式）是导致不同种族群体识别错误率差异的主要因素，非洲裔美国人受影响最严重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估商业自动语音识别系统中存在的种族偏见，分析社会语音变异如何导致不同种族群体间的识别性能差异。

Method: 使用太平洋西北英语语料库，分析四个种族背景说话者的转录准确性，引入启发式确定的语音错误率指标，将识别错误与11个社会语音特征相关联。

Result: 发现元音质量变异与不同种族群体的错误率差异系统性相关，非洲裔说话者在所有评估系统中受影响最显著，表明方言语音变异的声学建模是商业ASR系统偏见的主要来源。

Conclusion: PNWE语料库是语音技术偏见评估的宝贵资源，研究为通过针对性表示训练数据中的社会语音多样性来改进ASR性能提供了可行指导。

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic evaluation of racial bias in four major
commercial automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems using the Pacific
Northwest English (PNWE) corpus. We analyze transcription accuracy across
speakers from four ethnic backgrounds (African American, Caucasian American,
ChicanX, and Yakama) and examine how sociophonetic variation contributes to
differential system performance. We introduce a heuristically-determined
Phonetic Error Rate (PER) metric that links recognition errors to specific
linguistically motivated variables derived from sociophonetic annotation. Our
analysis of eleven sociophonetic features reveals that vowel quality variation,
particularly resistance to the low-back merger and pre-nasal merger patterns,
is systematically associated with differential error rates across ethnic
groups, with the most pronounced effects for African American speakers across
all evaluated systems. These findings demonstrate that acoustic modeling of
dialectal phonetic variation, rather than lexical or syntactic factors, remains
a primary source of bias in commercial ASR systems. The study establishes the
PNWE corpus as a valuable resource for bias evaluation in speech technologies
and provides actionable guidance for improving ASR performance through targeted
representation of sociophonetic diversity in training data.

*Noshitha Padma Pratyusha Juttu,Sahithi Singireddy,Sravani Gona,Sujal Timilsina*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 系统评估了在服务条款文档中进行不公平条款检测时，全参数微调、参数高效适应方法（LoRA、QLoRA）和零样本提示策略的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在文本理解方面表现出色，但在专业法律领域的适应仍受限于全参数微调的高昂成本，需要探索更高效的适应方法。

Method: 对BERT和DistilBERT进行全参数微调，对TinyLlama、LLaMA 3B/7B和SaulLM应用4位低秩适应（LoRA），并在零样本设置下评估GPT-4o和O版本模型。

Result: 全参数微调在精确率和召回率之间达到最佳平衡，而基于LoRA的模型在内存成本降低3倍的情况下仍能提供有竞争力的召回率。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了高效且领域适应的LLMs在实际设计中的权衡，为法律文本处理中的微调研究提供了开放的基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed text understanding, yet their
adaptation to specialized legal domains remains constrained by the cost of full
fine-tuning. This study provides a systematic evaluation of fine tuning,
parameter efficient adaptation (LoRA, QLoRA), and zero-shot prompting
strategies for unfair clause detection in Terms of Service (ToS) documents, a
key application in legal NLP. We finetune BERT and DistilBERT, apply 4-bit
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to models such as TinyLlama, LLaMA 3B/7B, and
SaulLM, and evaluate GPT-4o and O-versions in zero-shot settings. Experiments
on the CLAUDETTE-ToS benchmark and the Multilingual Scraper Corpus show that
full fine-tuning achieves the strongest precision recall balance, while
LoRA-based models provide competitive recall with up to 3x lower memory cost.
These findings highlight practical design trade-offs for efficient and
domain-adapted LLMs, contributing open baselines for fine-tuning research in
legal text processing.

*Ziyuan He,Yuxuan Wang,Jiaqi Li,Kexin Liang,Muhan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LooGLE v2是一个评估大语言模型在实际应用中长上下文理解能力的基准测试，包含从16k到2M tokens的真实世界长文本，涵盖法律、金融、游戏和代码等领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型的上下文窗口不断扩展，但它们在长依赖任务中的长上下文理解能力仍然有限且未被充分探索，特别是在许多实际的长上下文应用中缺乏基准测试。

Method: 自动收集真实世界长文本，精心设计10种领域特定的长依赖任务类型，通过可扩展的数据管理流程生成1,934个QA实例，并对6个本地部署和4个基于API的LLM进行全面评估。

Result: 评估结果显示，即使在最佳性能模型上，基准测试的总体得分仅为59.2%。尽管上下文窗口很大，但流行的LLM只能理解比声称长度短得多的上下文。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在处理具有长依赖关系的真实世界任务方面存在显著局限性，在实际长上下文理解方面仍有很大的改进空间。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are equipped with increasingly extended context
windows recently, yet their long context understanding capabilities over long
dependency tasks remain fundamentally limited and underexplored. This gap is
especially significant in many real-world long-context applications that were
rarely benchmarked. In this paper, we introduce LooGLE v2, a novel benchmark
designed to evaluate LLMs' long context ability in real-world applications and
scenarios. Our benchmark consists of automatically collected real-world long
texts, ranging from 16k to 2M tokens, encompassing domains in law, finance,
game and code. Accordingly, we delicately design 10 types of domain-specific
long-dependency tasks and generate 1,934 QA instances with various diversity
and complexity in a scalable data curation pipeline for further practical
needs. We conduct a comprehensive assessment of 6 locally deployed and 4
API-based LLMs. The evaluation results show that even the best-performing model
achieves only a 59.2% overall score on our benchmark. Despite the extensive
context windows, popular LLMs are only capable of understanding a much shorter
length of context than they claim to be, revealing significant limitations in
their ability to handle real-world tasks with long dependencies and
highlighting substantial room for model improvement in practical long-context
understanding.

### [45] [SABlock: Semantic-Aware KV Cache Eviction with Adaptive Compression Block Size](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22556)
*Jinhan Chen,Jianchun Liu,Hongli Xu,Xianjun Gao,Shilong Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SABlock是一个语义感知的KV缓存淘汰框架，通过自适应块大小来平衡语义连贯性和内存效率，显著减少长上下文LLM推理中的内存占用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存不断增长的内存占用成为长上下文LLM推理的可扩展性瓶颈，现有压缩方法难以平衡语义连贯性和内存效率。

Method: 首先进行语义分割以对齐压缩边界和语言结构，然后应用分段引导的token评分来优化token重要性估计，最后通过预算驱动的搜索策略自适应确定最优块大小。

Result: 在相同内存预算下，SABlock持续优于最先进的基线方法。在NIAH任务中，仅用96个KV条目就达到99.9%的检索准确率，接近保留8K条目的全缓存基线性能。在1024的固定缓存预算下，峰值内存使用减少46.28%，在128K上下文长度下解码速度提升高达9.5倍。

Conclusion: SABlock通过语义感知的自适应块大小策略，有效解决了KV缓存的内存瓶颈问题，在保持语义完整性的同时显著提升了压缩效率和推理性能。

Abstract: The growing memory footprint of the Key-Value (KV) cache poses a severe
scalability bottleneck for long-context Large Language Model (LLM) inference.
While KV cache eviction has emerged as an effective solution by discarding less
critical tokens, existing token-, block-, and sentence-level compression
methods struggle to balance semantic coherence and memory efficiency. To this
end, we introduce SABlock, a \underline{s}emantic-aware KV cache eviction
framework with \underline{a}daptive \underline{block} sizes. Specifically,
SABlock first performs semantic segmentation to align compression boundaries
with linguistic structures, then applies segment-guided token scoring to refine
token importance estimation. Finally, for each segment, a budget-driven search
strategy adaptively determines the optimal block size that preserves semantic
integrity while improving compression efficiency under a given cache budget.
Extensive experiments on long-context benchmarks demonstrate that SABlock
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under the same memory
budgets. For instance, on Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH), SABlock achieves 99.9%
retrieval accuracy with only 96 KV entries, nearly matching the performance of
the full-cache baseline that retains up to 8K entries. Under a fixed cache
budget of 1,024, SABlock further reduces peak memory usage by 46.28% and
achieves up to 9.5x faster decoding on a 128K context length.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出EduLoop-Agent端到端个性化学习代理，集成神经认知诊断模型、有界能力估计自适应测试策略和大语言模型，形成诊断-推荐-反馈闭环框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法将建模、题目选择和反馈孤立处理的问题，避免粗糙的学生模型、忽略诊断后验的自适应策略和通用无效的反馈。

Method: 使用神经认知诊断模型进行细粒度知识掌握度评估，有界能力估计自适应测试策略动态选择题目，大语言模型生成结构化可操作反馈。

Result: 在ASSISTments数据集上，神经认知诊断模型在响应预测和可解释掌握度评估方面表现良好，自适应推荐策略提高了题目相关性和个性化，LLM反馈提供针对性学习指导。

Conclusion: 该设计有效且可实际部署，为智能教育中生成个性化学习路径提供了可行途径。

Abstract: As information technology advances, education is moving from
one-size-fits-all instruction toward personalized learning. However, most
methods handle modeling, item selection, and feedback in isolation rather than
as a closed loop. This leads to coarse or opaque student models,
assumption-bound adaptivity that ignores diagnostic posteriors, and generic,
non-actionable feedback. To address these limitations, this paper presents an
end-to-end personalized learning agent, EduLoop-Agent, which integrates a
Neural Cognitive Diagnosis model (NCD), a Bounded-Ability Estimation
Computerized Adaptive Testing strategy (BECAT), and large language models
(LLMs). The NCD module provides fine-grained estimates of students' mastery at
the knowledge-point level; BECAT dynamically selects subsequent items to
maximize relevance and learning efficiency; and LLMs convert diagnostic signals
into structured, actionable feedback. Together, these components form a
closed-loop framework of ``Diagnosis--Recommendation--Feedback.'' Experiments
on the ASSISTments dataset show that the NCD module achieves strong performance
on response prediction while yielding interpretable mastery assessments. The
adaptive recommendation strategy improves item relevance and personalization,
and the LLM-based feedback offers targeted study guidance aligned with
identified weaknesses. Overall, the results indicate that the proposed design
is effective and practically deployable, providing a feasible pathway to
generating individualized learning trajectories in intelligent education.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI模型的成功加速了基于大语言模型的智能辅导系统发展，但这些系统的进展和影响难以追踪，因为缺乏可靠、通用且基于教学理论的评估框架和基准。现有评估大多依赖主观协议和非标准化基准，导致不一致性和有限泛化性。

Method: 通过回顾最先进的评估实践，结合真实案例研究分析相关挑战，并基于跨学科AI教育研究的见解，提出三个实用、可行且理论扎实的研究方向。

Result: 识别了当前智能辅导系统评估中的主要问题，包括主观性、非标准化和缺乏教学理论基础，为改进评估方法提供了具体方向。

Conclusion: 需要建立基于学习科学原理的公平、统一和可扩展的评估方法论，以更好地评估和推进智能辅导系统的发展。

Abstract: The interdisciplinary research domain of Artificial Intelligence in Education
(AIED) has a long history of developing Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) by
integrating insights from technological advancements, educational theories, and
cognitive psychology. The remarkable success of generative AI (GenAI) models
has accelerated the development of large language model (LLM)-powered ITSs,
which have potential to imitate human-like, pedagogically rich, and cognitively
demanding tutoring. However, the progress and impact of these systems remain
largely untraceable due to the absence of reliable, universally accepted, and
pedagogy-driven evaluation frameworks and benchmarks. Most existing educational
dialogue-based ITS evaluations rely on subjective protocols and
non-standardized benchmarks, leading to inconsistencies and limited
generalizability. In this work, we take a step back from mainstream ITS
development and provide comprehensive state-of-the-art evaluation practices,
highlighting associated challenges through real-world case studies from careful
and caring AIED research. Finally, building on insights from previous
interdisciplinary AIED research, we propose three practical, feasible, and
theoretically grounded research directions, rooted in learning science
principles and aimed at establishing fair, unified, and scalable evaluation
methodologies for ITSs.

Motivation: 解决静态基准测试存在的测试集污染和适应性有限的问题，提供持续评估演进语言模型的可扩展方案

Method: 采用相互同行评估机制，模型轮流作为问题生成器、参赛者和评委，通过迭代加权机制聚合同行判断形成共识排名

Result: 实验显示与MMLU-Pro和GPQA基准测试分别有78%和63%的强相关性，多评委设计显著优于单评委基线

Conclusion: AutoBench为持续评估演进语言模型提供了可扩展、抗污染的替代方案，分布式评估产生更稳健和人类一致的评估结果

Abstract: We present AutoBench, a fully automated and self-sustaining framework for
evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) through reciprocal peer assessment.
This paper provides a rigorous scientific validation of the AutoBench
methodology, originally developed as an open-source project by eZecute S.R.L..
Unlike static benchmarks that suffer from test-set contamination and limited
adaptability, AutoBench dynamically generates novel evaluation tasks while
models alternately serve as question generators, contestants, and judges across
diverse domains. An iterative weighting mechanism amplifies the influence of
consistently reliable evaluators, aggregating peer judgments into
consensus-based rankings that reflect collective model agreement. Our
experiments demonstrate strong correlations with established benchmarks
including MMLU-Pro and GPQA (respectively 78\% and 63\%), validating this
peer-driven evaluation paradigm. The multi-judge design significantly
outperforms single-judge baselines, confirming that distributed evaluation
produces more robust and human-consistent assessments. AutoBench offers a
scalable, contamination-resistant alternative to static benchmarks for the
continuous evaluation of evolving language models.

Conclusion: PCU不仅能为个人改善健康结果，还为公共卫生和科学发现提供了新的基础平台，但实现这一范式仍面临架构设计和实施挑战。

Abstract: Building on decades of success in digital infrastructure and biomedical
innovation, we propose the Personal Care Utility (PCU) - a cybernetic system
for lifelong health guidance. PCU is conceived as a global, AI-powered utility
that continuously orchestrates multimodal data, knowledge, and services to
assist individuals and populations alike. Drawing on multimodal agents,
event-centric modeling, and contextual inference, it offers three essential
capabilities: (1) trusted health information tailored to the individual, (2)
proactive health navigation and behavior guidance, and (3) ongoing
interpretation of recovery and treatment response after medical events. Unlike
conventional episodic care, PCU functions as an ambient, adaptive companion -
observing, interpreting, and guiding health in real time across daily life. By
integrating personal sensing, experiential computing, and population-level
analytics, PCU promises not only improved outcomes for individuals but also a
new substrate for public health and scientific discovery. We describe the
architecture, design principles, and implementation challenges of this emerging
paradigm.

Motivation: 创建波斯语常识推理基准，填补该语言在常识推理任务上的空白，促进波斯语NLP研究的发展。

Method: 使用基于连词的分割策略生成句子补全对，提出DRESS-AF方法通过嵌入相似性评分和对抗性过滤从正确答案池中选择干扰项。

Result: 人类标注者准确率89%，OpenAI-o3达到92.18%，Claude-Sonnet-3.7为91.17%，最强开源模型DeepSeek-R1为82.51%。DRESS-AF方法在英语HellaSwag基准上也有效。

Conclusion: PerCoR是一个具有挑战性的波斯语常识推理基准，展示了当前模型在波斯语常识推理上的性能差距，DRESS-AF方法可有效提升基准难度。

Abstract: We introduced PerCoR (Persian Commonsense Reasoning), the first large-scale
Persian benchmark for commonsense reasoning. PerCoR contains 106K
multiple-choice sentence-completion problems drawn from more than forty news,
cultural, and other web sources. We introduce a novel conjunction-based
segmentation strategy to generate coherent sentence-completion pairs, enabling
broad topical and structural diversity. To create challenging distractors, we
propose DRESS-AF (Distractor Ranking via Embedding Similarity Scoring and
Adversarial Filtering), a generation-free adversarial filtering method that
selects distractors from the pool of gold continuations while maximising model
confusion. Human annotators score 89% on PerCoR, while OpenAI-o3 achieves the
highest performance at 92.18%, followed closely by Claude-Sonnet-3.7 (91.17%).
The strongest open-source model, DeepSeek-R1, reaches 82.51%, underscoring both
the dataset's difficulty and the remaining performance gap in Persian
commonsense reasoning. We further show that DRESS-AF transfers to the English
HellaSwag benchmark, increasing its difficulty without hurting human
solvability. The dataset is available at

collected via fieldwork, followed by the creation of a morpheme-tagged,
trilingual corpus used to train a Small Language Model (SLM) and a
Transformer-based translation engine. The analysis covers inflectional
morphology such as person-number-gender agreement, tense-aspect-mood
distinctions, and case marking, alongside derivational strategies that reflect
word-class changes. Script standardization and digital literacy tools were also
developed to enhance script usage. The study offers a sustainable model for
preserving endangered languages by incorporating traditional linguistic
methodology with AI. This bridge between linguistic research with technological

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出CR-FKGC框架，通过邻域聚合编码器、共轭关系学习器和流形共轭解码器来解决少样本知识图谱补全中的复杂关系模式和数据稀疏问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的少样本知识图谱补全方法难以捕捉复杂关系模式并缓解数据稀疏性，这限制了其在长尾分布场景下的性能。

Method: 使用邻域聚合编码器整合高阶邻居信息；共轭关系学习器结合隐式条件扩散关系模块和稳定关系模块来捕捉稳定语义和不确定性偏移；流形共轭解码器在流形空间中高效评估和推断缺失三元组。

Result: 在三个基准测试上的实验表明，该方法优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: CR-FKGC框架通过共轭关系建模有效提升了少样本知识图谱补全的性能，特别是在处理复杂关系模式和数据稀疏问题方面表现出色。

Abstract: Few-shot Knowledge Graph Completion (FKGC) infers missing triples from
limited support samples, tackling long-tail distribution challenges. Existing
methods, however, struggle to capture complex relational patterns and mitigate
data sparsity. To address these challenges, we propose a novel FKGC framework
for conjugate relation modeling (CR-FKGC). Specifically, it employs a
neighborhood aggregation encoder to integrate higher-order neighbor
information, a conjugate relation learner combining an implicit conditional
diffusion relation module with a stable relation module to capture stable
semantics and uncertainty offsets, and a manifold conjugate decoder for
efficient evaluation and inference of missing triples in manifold space.
Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves superior
performance over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 提出了首个使用if-then规则来解释检索增强生成(RAG)大语言模型的方法，通过分析检索源的存在与否来解释输出来源，并提出了优化规则生成的算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于RAG使LLM系统能够在推理时整合检索信息，需要一种方法来解释输出与检索源之间的关系，理解模型决策的溯源。

Method: 提出基于Apriori剪枝优化的规则生成方法，通过分析不同检索源组合对LLM输出的影响来生成解释性规则，避免暴力枚举所有可能组合。

Result: 通过定性和定量实验验证了所提解决方案的价值和效率，展示了规则生成方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为解释RAG增强的LLM系统提供了有效的规则化解释框架，能够揭示输出与检索源之间的因果关系。

Abstract: If-then rules are widely used to explain machine learning models; e.g., "if
employed = no, then loan application = rejected." We present the first proposal
to apply rules to explain the emerging class of large language models (LLMs)
with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Since RAG enables LLM systems to
incorporate retrieved information sources at inference time, rules linking the
presence or absence of sources can explain output provenance; e.g., "if a Times
Higher Education ranking article is retrieved, then the LLM ranks Oxford
first." To generate such rules, a brute force approach would probe the LLM with
all source combinations and check if the presence or absence of any sources
leads to the same output. We propose optimizations to speed up rule generation,
inspired by Apriori-like pruning from frequent itemset mining but redefined
within the scope of our novel problem. We conclude with qualitative and
quantitative experiments demonstrating our solutions' value and efficiency.

Abstract: Despite their impressive generalization capabilities, instruction-tuned Large
Language Models often underperform on text classification benchmarks. We
introduce SALSA, a coherent pipeline that combines structured prompting,
class-to-token mapping, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, thereby avoiding
cold-start training. Each class label is mapped to a distinct output token, and
prompts are constructed to elicit a single-token response. During inference,
the model's output is projected only onto the logits of the relevant class
tokens, enabling efficient and accurate classification in a single forward
pass. SALSA achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks,
demonstrating its robustness and scalability for LLM-based classification
applications.

TL;DR: E²Rank是一个统一的嵌入排序框架，通过持续训练将单个文本嵌入模型扩展到同时执行高质量检索和列表重排序，在保持效率的同时显著提升重排序性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本嵌入模型在检索应用中效率高但排序保真度有限，而专门的LLM列表重排序器虽然效果好但效率较低，需要统一高效且准确的排序方案。

Method: 使用查询和文档嵌入的余弦相似度作为统一排序函数，构建包含原始查询和候选文档的列表排序提示，类似于传统检索中的伪相关反馈，通过列表排序目标进行持续训练。

Result: 在BEIR重排序基准上达到最先进结果，在BRIGHT推理密集型基准上表现竞争力，重排序延迟很低，且在MTEB基准上嵌入性能也有所提升。

Conclusion: 单个嵌入模型可以有效统一检索和重排序任务，在计算效率和排序准确性方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Text embedding models serve as a fundamental component in real-world search
applications. By mapping queries and documents into a shared embedding space,
they deliver competitive retrieval performance with high efficiency. However,
their ranking fidelity remains limited compared to dedicated rerankers,
especially recent LLM-based listwise rerankers, which capture fine-grained
query-document and document-document interactions. In this paper, we propose a
simple yet effective unified framework $\text{E}^2\text{Rank}$, means Efficient
Embedding-based Ranking (also means Embedding-to-Rank), which extends a single
text embedding model to perform both high-quality retrieval and listwise
reranking through continued training under a listwise ranking objective,
thereby achieving strong effectiveness with remarkable efficiency. By applying
cosine similarity between the query and document embeddings as a unified
ranking function, the listwise ranking prompt, which is constructed from the
original query and its candidate documents, serves as an enhanced query
enriched with signals from the top-K documents, akin to pseudo-relevance
feedback (PRF) in traditional retrieval models. This design preserves the
efficiency and representational quality of the base embedding model while
significantly improving its reranking performance. Empirically,
$\textrm{E}^2\text{Rank}$ achieves state-of-the-art results on the BEIR
reranking benchmark and demonstrates competitive performance on the
reasoning-intensive BRIGHT benchmark, with very low reranking latency. We also
show that the ranking training process improves embedding performance on the
MTEB benchmark. Our findings indicate that a single embedding model can
effectively unify retrieval and reranking, offering both computational
efficiency and competitive ranking accuracy.

TL;DR: 使用低秩适应(LoRA)和计算高效的持续预训练方法，在有限数据和计算预算下，将三个LLM适配到魁北克法语方言，在少数民族方言基准上取得改进，同时主流语言基准回归最小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型广泛应用，但其最强能力仍局限于少数高资源语言。需要为低资源方言开发成本效益高的适配方法，扩大高质量LLM对少数民族语言社区的访问。

Method: 采用低秩适应(LoRA)和计算高效的持续预训练(CPT)，使用极小数据集适配三个LLM到魁北克法语方言，在COLE套件上进行基准测试。

Result: 实验显示在少数民族方言基准上有所改进，主流语言基准回归最小(仅更新不到1%的参数)。结果增益高度依赖于语料库组成。

Conclusion: CPT与参数高效微调(PEFT)可以通过提供成本效益高且可持续的语言资源创建来缩小方言差距，扩大高质量LLM对少数民族语言社区的访问。

Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs), their
strongest capabilities remain largely confined to a small number of
high-resource languages for which there is abundant training data. Recently,
continual pre-training (CPT) has emerged as a means to fine-tune these models
to low-resource regional dialects. In this paper, we study the use of CPT for
dialect learning under tight data and compute budgets. Using low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) and compute-efficient continual pre-training, we adapt three
LLMs to the Qu\'ebec French dialect using a very small dataset and benchmark
them on the COLE suite. Our experiments demonstrate an improvement on the
minority dialect benchmarks with minimal regression on the prestige language
benchmarks with under 1% of model parameters updated. Analysis of the results
demonstrate that gains are highly contingent on corpus composition. These
findings indicate that CPT with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) can
narrow the dialect gap by providing cost-effective and sustainable language
resource creation, expanding high-quality LLM access to minority linguistic
communities. We release the first Qu\'ebec French LLMs on HuggingFace.

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在上下文学习中的时间偏差，发现模型在预测下一个词时倾向于选择序列开头或结尾处重复出现的词，这与人类情景记忆的时间分离机制类似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型语言模型是否能够像人类情景记忆那样，通过时间分离来区分和检索不同时间发生的事件，从而理解上下文学习中的时间关系机制。

Method: 通过在序列中固定重复词的位置并置换其他词，消除语义干扰，隔离时间因素对下一个词预测的影响。使用包括transformer和状态空间模型在内的多种预训练模型进行实验。

Result: 模型一致地将最高概率分配给重复词后面的词，但存在明显的偏向性——更倾向于序列开头或结尾的词。在transformer中，这种现象与归纳头相关。状态空间和transformer模型表现出相似的时间偏差。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了上下文学习中存在的时间偏差，这些偏差能够实现时间分离和情景检索，加深了对大型语言模型记忆检索机制的理解。

Abstract: In-context learning is governed by both temporal and semantic relationships,
shaping how Large Language Models (LLMs) retrieve contextual information.
Analogous to human episodic memory, where the retrieval of specific events is
enabled by separating events that happened at different times, this work probes
the ability of various pretrained LLMs, including transformer and state-space
models, to differentiate and retrieve temporally separated events.
Specifically, we prompted models with sequences containing multiple
presentations of the same token, which reappears at the sequence end. By fixing
the positions of these repeated tokens and permuting all others, we removed
semantic confounds and isolated temporal effects on next-token prediction.
Across diverse sequences, models consistently placed the highest probabilities
on tokens following a repeated token, but with a notable bias for those nearest
the beginning or end of the input. An ablation experiment linked this
phenomenon in transformers to induction heads. Extending the analysis to unique
semantic contexts with partial overlap further demonstrated that memories
embedded in the middle of a prompt are retrieved less reliably. Despite
architectural differences, state-space and transformer models showed comparable
temporal biases. Our findings deepen the understanding of temporal biases in
in-context learning and offer an illustration of how these biases can enable
temporal separation and episodic retrieval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试通常孤立评估语言、声学、推理或对话能力，忽视了这些技能整合对于实现类人、情感智能对话的重要性。

Method: 设计了首个相互关联的多层次基准测试，通过顺序、上下文关联的任务模拟共情对话的认知过程：口语内容理解、声音线索感知、整合推理和回应生成。

Result: 测试12个先进SLM显示，即使最先进的模型在处理高表现力声音线索方面也存在困难，限制了共情回应质量。

Conclusion: 需要开发能够整合语言内容与多样化声音线索的SLM，以实现真正的共情对话能力。

Abstract: Speech Language Models (SLMs) have made significant progress in spoken
language understanding. Yet it remains unclear whether they can fully perceive
non lexical vocal cues alongside spoken words, and respond with empathy that
aligns with both emotional and contextual factors. Existing benchmarks
typically evaluate linguistic, acoustic, reasoning, or dialogue abilities in
isolation, overlooking the integration of these skills that is crucial for
human-like, emotionally intelligent conversation. We present EchoMind, the
first interrelated, multi-level benchmark that simulates the cognitive process
of empathetic dialogue through sequential, context-linked tasks: spoken-content
understanding, vocal-cue perception, integrated reasoning, and response
generation. All tasks share identical and semantically neutral scripts that are
free of explicit emotional or contextual cues, and controlled variations in
vocal style are used to test the effect of delivery independent of the
transcript. EchoMind is grounded in an empathy-oriented framework spanning 3
coarse and 12 fine-grained dimensions, encompassing 39 vocal attributes, and
evaluated using both objective and subjective metrics. Testing 12 advanced SLMs
reveals that even state-of-the-art models struggle with high-expressive vocal
cues, limiting empathetic response quality. Analyses of prompt strength, speech
source, and ideal vocal cue recognition reveal persistent weaknesses in
instruction-following, resilience to natural speech variability, and effective
use of vocal cues for empathy. These results underscore the need for SLMs that
integrate linguistic content with diverse vocal cues to achieve truly
empathetic conversational ability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MMPersuade是一个研究大型视觉语言模型在多媒体内容中说服动态的框架，发现多模态输入显著增强说服效果，特别是在错误信息场景中，不同说服策略在不同情境下效果各异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型视觉语言模型在购物、健康、新闻等领域的部署，它们面临大量说服性内容。了解这些模型如何被多模态说服内容影响至关重要，因为过度易受影响的模型可能采纳误导性信念或生成不道德输出。

Method: 提出了MMPersuade框架，包含(i)包含图像和视频的多模态数据集，涵盖商业、主观行为和对立情境下的说服原则；(ii)通过第三方协议评分和自估计标记概率评估说服效果和模型易感性的框架。

Result: 对六个领先LVLM的研究显示：(i)多模态输入相比纯文本显著增强说服效果；(ii)陈述的先前偏好降低易感性，但多模态信息仍保持说服优势；(iii)不同策略在不同情境下效果不同，互惠在商业和主观情境最有效，可信度和逻辑在对立情境占主导。

Conclusion: MMPersuade通过联合分析说服效果和易感性，为开发在面对说服性多模态内容时更稳健、偏好一致且符合伦理的模型提供了原则性基础。

Abstract: As Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly deployed in domains
such as shopping, health, and news, they are exposed to pervasive persuasive
content. A critical question is how these models function as persuadees-how and
why they can be influenced by persuasive multimodal inputs. Understanding both
their susceptibility to persuasion and the effectiveness of different
persuasive strategies is crucial, as overly persuadable models may adopt
misleading beliefs, override user preferences, or generate unethical or unsafe
outputs when exposed to manipulative messages. We introduce MMPersuade, a
unified framework for systematically studying multimodal persuasion dynamics in
LVLMs. MMPersuade contributes (i) a comprehensive multimodal dataset that pairs
images and videos with established persuasion principles across commercial,
subjective and behavioral, and adversarial contexts, and (ii) an evaluation
framework that quantifies both persuasion effectiveness and model
susceptibility via third-party agreement scoring and self-estimated token
probabilities on conversation histories. Our study of six leading LVLMs as
persuadees yields three key insights: (i) multimodal inputs substantially
increase persuasion effectiveness-and model susceptibility-compared to text
alone, especially in misinformation scenarios; (ii) stated prior preferences
decrease susceptibility, yet multimodal information maintains its persuasive
advantage; and (iii) different strategies vary in effectiveness across
contexts, with reciprocity being most potent in commercial and subjective
contexts, and credibility and logic prevailing in adversarial contexts. By
jointly analyzing persuasion effectiveness and susceptibility, MMPersuade
provides a principled foundation for developing models that are robust,
preference-consistent, and ethically aligned when engaging with persuasive
multimodal content.

TL;DR: R4P是一个基于推理的补丁验证模型，为软件工程代理提供可扩展的奖励机制，解决了传统测试监督方法在可扩展性和稳定性方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于测试的监督方法存在两个问题：(1) 构建和运行测试沙盒既繁重又脆弱；(2) 具有高覆盖率测试的数据稀缺且容易受到边缘案例测试攻击的威胁。

Method: R4P将补丁验证视为推理任务，采用分组目标进行强化学习训练，能够验证多个补丁之间的修改并获得密集奖励以实现稳定训练。

Result: R4P在SWE-bench-verified上达到72.2%的补丁验证准确率，比OpenAI o3更优。基于R4P训练的Mini-SE在SWE-bench-verified上达到26.2% Pass@1，比原Qwen3-32B提升10.0%。R4P验证补丁速度比测试快50倍。

Conclusion: R4P通过推理驱动的补丁验证提供了可扩展、高效且稳定的奖励机制，显著提升了软件工程代理的性能和训练效率。

Abstract: While large language model agents have advanced software engineering tasks,
the unscalable nature of existing test-based supervision is limiting the
potential improvement of data scaling. The reason is twofold: (1) building and
running test sandbox is rather heavy and fragile, and (2) data with
high-coverage tests is naturally rare and threatened by test hacking via edge
cases. In this paper, we propose R4P, a patch verifier model to provide
scalable rewards for training and testing SWE agents via reasoning. We consider
that patch verification is fundamentally a reasoning task, mirroring how human
repository maintainers review patches without writing and running new
reproduction tests. To obtain sufficient reference and reduce the risk of
reward hacking, R4P uses a group-wise objective for RL training, enabling it to
verify multiple patches against each other's modification and gain a dense
reward for stable training. R4P achieves 72.2% Acc. for verifying patches from
SWE-bench-verified, surpassing OpenAI o3. To demonstrate R4P's practicality, we
design and train a lite scaffold, Mini-SE, with pure reinforcement learning
where all rewards are derived from R4P. As a result, Mini-SE achieves 26.2%
Pass@1 on SWE-bench-verified, showing a 10.0% improvement over the original
Qwen3-32B. This can be further improved to 32.8% with R4P for test-time
scaling. Furthermore, R4P verifies patches within a second, 50x faster than
testing on average. The stable scaling curves of rewards and accuracy along
with high efficiency reflect R4P's practicality.

Motivation: 人道组织面临关键选择：投资昂贵的商业API还是依赖免费的开源模型进行多语言人权监控。商业系统提供可靠性，但开源替代方案缺乏实证验证，特别是在冲突地区常见的低资源语言上。

Method: 在78,000次多语言推理中评估了六个模型（四个指令对齐模型和两个开源模型），使用标准分类指标和新的跨语言可靠性度量：校准偏差、决策偏差、语言鲁棒性得分和语言稳定性得分。

Result: 结果显示对齐而非规模决定稳定性：对齐模型在类型学上遥远和低资源语言（如林加拉语、缅甸语）上保持近乎不变的准确性和平衡校准，而开源模型表现出显著的提示语言敏感性和校准漂移。

Conclusion: 多语言对齐实现了语言无关的推理，为人道组织在多语言部署中平衡预算约束与可靠性提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Humanitarian organizations face a critical choice: invest in costly
commercial APIs or rely on free open-weight models for multilingual human
rights monitoring. While commercial systems offer reliability, open-weight
alternatives lack empirical validation -- especially for low-resource languages
common in conflict zones. This paper presents the first systematic comparison
of commercial and open-weight large language models (LLMs) for
human-rights-violation detection across seven languages, quantifying the
cost-reliability trade-off facing resource-constrained organizations. Across
78,000 multilingual inferences, we evaluate six models -- four
instruction-aligned (Claude-Sonnet-4, DeepSeek-V3, Gemini-Flash-2.0,
GPT-4.1-mini) and two open-weight (LLaMA-3-8B, Mistral-7B) -- using both
standard classification metrics and new measures of cross-lingual reliability:
Calibration Deviation (CD), Decision Bias (B), Language Robustness Score (LRS),
and Language Stability Score (LSS). Results show that alignment, not scale,
determines stability: aligned models maintain near-invariant accuracy and
balanced calibration across typologically distant and low-resource languages
(e.g., Lingala, Burmese), while open-weight models exhibit significant
prompt-language sensitivity and calibration drift. These findings demonstrate
that multilingual alignment enables language-agnostic reasoning and provide
practical guidance for humanitarian organizations balancing budget constraints
with reliability in multilingual deployment.

Abstract: Understanding how ideas develop and flow in small-group conversations is
critical for analyzing collaborative learning. A key structural feature of
these interactions is threading, the way discourse talk naturally organizes
into interwoven topical strands that evolve over time. While threading has been
widely studied in asynchronous text settings, detecting threads in synchronous
spoken dialogue remains challenging due to overlapping turns and implicit cues.
At the same time, large language models (LLMs) show promise for automating
discourse analysis but often struggle with long-context tasks that depend on
tracing these conversational links. In this paper, we investigate whether
explicit thread linkages can improve LLM-based coding of relational moves in
group talk. We contribute a systematic guidebook for identifying threads in
synchronous multi-party transcripts and benchmark different LLM prompting
strategies for automated threading. We then test how threading influences
performance on downstream coding of conversational analysis frameworks, that
capture core collaborative actions such as agreeing, building, and eliciting.
Our results show that providing clear conversational thread information
improves LLM coding performance and underscores the heavy reliance of
downstream analysis on well-structured dialogue. We also discuss practical
trade-offs in time and cost, emphasizing where human-AI hybrid approaches can
yield the best value. Together, this work advances methods for combining LLMs
and robust conversational thread structures to make sense of complex, real-time
group interactions.

Motivation: 现有方法如CoT和PoT在复杂多步推理中经常产生不理想的解决方案，特别是在算法领域，需要更有效的推理增强方法。

Method: PIPS在实例级别生成和优化程序，使用结构反馈，并引入置信度指标动态选择直接推理或程序合成。

Result: 在30个基准测试中，PIPS相比PoT和CoT分别提升绝对调和平均准确率8.6%和9.4%，在算法任务中减少65.1%的不良程序生成。

Conclusion: PIPS通过实例级程序合成和动态策略选择，显著提升了LLM在复杂推理任务中的性能，减少了不良解决方案的产生。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at zero-shot inference but continue to
struggle with complex, multi-step reasoning. Recent methods that augment LLMs
with intermediate reasoning steps such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and Program of
Thought (PoT) improve performance but often produce undesirable solutions,
especially in algorithmic domains. We introduce Per-Instance Program Synthesis
(PIPS), a method that generates and refines programs at the instance-level
using structural feedback without relying on task-specific guidance or explicit
test cases. To further improve performance, PIPS incorporates a confidence
metric that dynamically chooses between direct inference and program synthesis
on a per-instance basis. Experiments across three frontier LLMs and 30
benchmarks including all tasks of Big Bench Extra Hard (BBEH), visual question
answering tasks, relational reasoning tasks, and mathematical reasoning tasks
show that PIPS improves the absolute harmonic mean accuracy by up to 8.6% and
9.4% compared to PoT and CoT respectively, and reduces undesirable program
generations by 65.1% on the algorithmic tasks compared to PoT with
Gemini-2.0-Flash.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型的内部表示高度"纠缠"，混合了词汇、句法、语义和推理信息，这导致传统脑编码分析偏向浅层语言特征，难以分离更深层认知过程的神经基础。

Method: 通过探测语言模型识别特征特定层，迭代回归掉低层级表示，生成四个几乎正交的嵌入：词汇、句法、语义和推理，并用这些解缠嵌入建模颅内脑电记录。

Result: 1) 分离的推理嵌入具有独特预测能力，能解释其他语言特征无法解释的神经活动方差；2) 推理的神经信号在时间上更晚出现（350-400ms）；3) 标准未解缠的LLM嵌入具有误导性，其预测成功主要归因于浅层语言特征。

Conclusion: 解缠方法揭示了推理处理的独特神经特征，表明标准语言模型嵌入会掩盖深层认知处理的贡献，为理解大脑语言处理层次提供了新见解。

Abstract: Understanding how the human brain progresses from processing simple
linguistic inputs to performing high-level reasoning is a fundamental challenge
in neuroscience. While modern large language models (LLMs) are increasingly
used to model neural responses to language, their internal representations are
highly "entangled," mixing information about lexicon, syntax, meaning, and
reasoning. This entanglement biases conventional brain encoding analyses toward
linguistically shallow features (e.g., lexicon and syntax), making it difficult
to isolate the neural substrates of cognitively deeper processes. Here, we
introduce a residual disentanglement method that computationally isolates these
components. By first probing an LM to identify feature-specific layers, our
method iteratively regresses out lower-level representations to produce four
nearly orthogonal embeddings for lexicon, syntax, meaning, and, critically,
reasoning. We used these disentangled embeddings to model intracranial (ECoG)
brain recordings from neurosurgical patients listening to natural speech. We
show that: 1) This isolated reasoning embedding exhibits unique predictive
power, accounting for variance in neural activity not explained by other
linguistic features and even extending to the recruitment of visual regions
beyond classical language areas. 2) The neural signature for reasoning is
temporally distinct, peaking later (~350-400ms) than signals related to
lexicon, syntax, and meaning, consistent with its position atop a processing
hierarchy. 3) Standard, non-disentangled LLM embeddings can be misleading, as
their predictive success is primarily attributable to linguistically shallow
features, masking the more subtle contributions of deeper cognitive processing.

### [69] [Interpreting and Mitigating Unwanted Uncertainty in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22866)
*Tiasa Singha Roy,Ayush Rajesh Jhaveri,Ilias Triantafyllopoulos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究大语言模型中的不确定性现象，即模型在重新提示时将先前正确答案改为错误答案的行为。通过机制解释性分析，识别出导致该现象的关键注意力头，并提出简单有效的缓解方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型存在不确定性行为，即在重新提示时会改变先前正确的答案，这在高风险领域会破坏信任并带来严重风险。研究旨在揭示这种行为的驱动机制。

Method: 采用Needle-in-a-Haystack检索框架，结合Flip式重新评估提示来模拟真实的答案翻转场景，通过机制解释性分析识别关键注意力头。

Result: 发现检索头不是避免不确定性的主要原因，而是识别出一小部分非检索注意力头会过度关注误导性标记。屏蔽这些头可将翻转行为减少高达15%，且不会引入不连贯或过度修正。

Conclusion: 研究为机制解释性领域做出贡献，提供了一种简单有效的技术来缓解LLMs中不确定性驱动的故障模式，但在下游任务中存在权衡。

Abstract: Despite their impressive capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit
unwanted uncertainty, a phenomenon where a model changes a previously correct
answer into an incorrect one when re-prompted. This behavior undermines trust
and poses serious risks in high-stakes domains. In this work, we investigate
the mechanisms that drive this phenomenon. We adapt the Needle-in-a-Haystack
retrieval framework and integrate a Flip-style re-evaluation prompt to simulate
realistic answer-flipping scenarios. We find that retrieval heads are not
primarily responsible for avoiding uncertainty. Instead, we identify a small
set of non-retrieval attention heads that disproportionately attend to
misleading tokens in uncertain contexts. Masking these heads yields significant
improvements, reducing flip behavior by up to 15% without introducing
incoherence or overcorrection. However, when tested for downstream tasks, we
observe trade-offs with flip behavior. Our findings contribute to the growing
field of mechanistic interpretability and present a simple yet effective
technique for mitigating uncertainty-driven failure modes in LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一个包含超过58,000个文本样本的数据集，结合了真实的纽约时报文章和多个先进LLM生成的合成版本，用于AI文本检测和模型归因研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM生成文本越来越接近人类水平，需要大规模、多样化且标注良好的数据集来可靠检测AI生成文本并将其归因到特定模型，以应对内容真实性、错误信息和可信度问题。

Method: 构建了一个综合数据集，包含真实纽约时报文章和由Gemma-2-9b、Mistral-7B、Qwen-2-72B、LLaMA-8B、Yi-Large、GPT-4-o等多个先进LLM生成的合成版本，提供原始文章摘要作为提示和完整人类撰写叙述。

Result: 为两个关键任务建立了基线结果：区分人类撰写与AI生成文本的准确率为58.35%，将AI文本归因到生成模型的准确率为8.92%。

Conclusion: 通过将真实世界新闻内容与现代生成模型相结合，该数据集旨在促进稳健检测和归因方法的发展，在生成AI时代培养信任和透明度。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to increasingly
human-like AI-generated text, raising concerns about content authenticity,
misinformation, and trustworthiness. Addressing the challenge of reliably
detecting AI-generated text and attributing it to specific models requires
large-scale, diverse, and well-annotated datasets. In this work, we present a
comprehensive dataset comprising over 58,000 text samples that combine
authentic New York Times articles with synthetic versions generated by multiple
state-of-the-art LLMs including Gemma-2-9b, Mistral-7B, Qwen-2-72B, LLaMA-8B,
Yi-Large, and GPT-4-o. The dataset provides original article abstracts as
prompts, full human-authored narratives. We establish baseline results for two
key tasks: distinguishing human-written from AI-generated text, achieving an
accuracy of 58.35\%, and attributing AI texts to their generating models with
an accuracy of 8.92\%. By bridging real-world journalistic content with modern
generative models, the dataset aims to catalyze the development of robust
detection and attribution methods, fostering trust and transparency in the era
of generative AI. Our dataset is available at:

### [71] [Batch Speculative Decoding Done Right](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22876)
*Ranran Haoran Zhang,Soumik Dey,Ashirbad Mishra,Hansi Wu,Binbin Li,Rui Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了EQSPEC和EXSPEC两种批量推测解码方法，解决了批量处理中的不规则张量问题，在保持输出等价性的同时显著提升推理吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推测解码通过小模型预测多个token并用大模型并行验证来加速LLM推理。但在批量处理时会出现不规则张量问题：同一批次中不同序列接受的预测token数量不同，破坏了右对齐，导致位置ID、注意力掩码和KV缓存状态损坏，现有实现违反了输出等价性要求。

Method: 1) 描述保证正确性的同步要求；2) 提出EQSPEC方法，发现重新对齐占40%开销；3) 引入EXSPEC方法，维护滑动序列池并动态形成相同长度组，减少重新对齐开销同时保持单序列推测加速。

Result: 在SpecBench数据集上，使用Vicuna-7B/68M、Qwen3-8B/0.6B和GLM-4-9B/0.6B目标/草稿模型对，在批次大小8时相比批次大小1实现了最高3倍的吞吐量提升，高效扩展到批次大小8，同时保持95%的输出等价性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法无需定制内核，可干净集成到现有推理栈中，有效解决了批量推测解码中的不规则张量问题，在保持正确性的同时显著提升性能。

Abstract: Speculative decoding speeds up LLM inference by using a small draft model to
propose multiple tokens that a target model verifies in parallel. Extending
this idea to batches is essential for production serving, but it introduces the
ragged tensor problem: sequences in the same batch accept different numbers of
draft tokens, breaking right-alignment and corrupting position IDs, attention
masks, and KV-cache state. We show that several existing batch implementations
violate output equivalence-the fundamental requirement that speculative
decoding must produce identical token sequences to standard autoregressive
generation. These violations occur precisely due to improper handling of the
ragged tensor problem. In response, we (1) characterize the synchronization
requirements that guarantee correctness, (2) present a correctness-first batch
speculative decoding EQSPEC that exposes realignment as consuming 40% of
overhead, and (3) introduce EXSPEC, which maintains a sliding pool of sequences
and dynamically forms same-length groups, to reduce the realignment overhead
while preserving per-sequence speculative speedups. On the SpecBench dataset,
across Vicuna-7B/68M, Qwen3-8B/0.6B, and GLM-4-9B/0.6B target/draft pairs, our
approach achieves up to 3$\times$ throughput improvement at batch size 8
compared to batch size 1, with efficient scaling through batch size 8, while
maintaining 95% output equivalence. Our method requires no custom kernels and
integrates cleanly with existing inference stacks. Our code is available at

TL;DR: Lanser-CLI是一个CLI优先的编排层，通过固定和协调语言服务器协议(LSP)服务器，为编码代理和CI提供确定性、可重放的工作流。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常产生幻觉API和错误定位编辑，而语言服务器能计算关于真实代码的已验证、IDE级事实。

Method: 开发了选择器DSL进行稳健寻址、确定性分析包、安全操作信封和基于语言服务器事实的过程奖励函数。

Result: 建立了在冻结快照下的确定性形式化，并为过程奖励建立了单调性属性，使其适用于过程监督和反事实分析。

Conclusion: 语言服务器不仅提供结构信息，还提供可操作的过程奖励，将代理的规划循环与程序现实对齐。

Abstract: Large language models routinely hallucinate APIs and mislocalize edits, while
language servers compute verified, IDE-grade facts about real code. We present
Lanser-CLI, a CLI-first orchestration layer that pins and mediates a Language
Server Protocol (LSP) server for coding agents and CI, exposing deterministic,
replayable workflows. Our position is that language servers provide not only
structural information (definitions, references, types, diagnostics) but also
an actionable process reward: machine-checked, step-wise signals that align an
agent's planning loop with program reality. In this work, Lanser-CLI
contributes: (i) a robust addressing scheme beyond brittle "file:line:col" via
a Selector DSL (symbolic, AST-path, and content-anchored selectors) with a
principled relocation algorithm; (ii) deterministic Analysis Bundles that
normalize Language Server responses and capture environment/capability metadata
with stable content hashes; (iii) a safety envelope for mutating operations
(rename, code actions) with preview, workspace jails, and Git-aware,
transactional apply; and (iv) a process-reward functional derived from Language
Server facts (diagnostic deltas, disambiguation confidence, and safe-apply
checks) that is computable online and replayable offline. We formalize
determinism under frozen snapshots and establish a monotonicity property for
the process reward, making it suitable for process supervision and
counterfactual analysis. Project Page:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Infinity-Chat数据集，用于评估语言模型在开放性问题生成中的多样性，揭示了语言模型存在的人工蜂群效应（模式崩溃），即模型内部和模型间生成内容高度同质化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在生成多样化、类似人类的创意内容方面存在困难，长期暴露于相似输出可能导致人类思维同质化，但目前缺乏评估LM输出多样性的可扩展方法。

Method: 引入Infinity-Chat数据集，包含26K个多样化的真实世界开放查询，建立了首个全面的开放提示分类法（6个顶级类别，17个子类别），并收集了31,250个人类标注。

Result: 发现语言模型存在显著的人工蜂群效应：模型内部重复生成相似回答，不同模型间产生惊人相似的输出；LM、奖励模型和LM评判器在人类偏好存在差异的生成内容上校准较差。

Conclusion: Infinity-Chat为系统研究真实世界开放查询提供了首个大规模资源，揭示了缓解人工蜂群效应带来的长期AI安全风险的关键见解。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) often struggle to generate diverse, human-like creative
content, raising concerns about the long-term homogenization of human thought
through repeated exposure to similar outputs. Yet scalable methods for
evaluating LM output diversity remain limited, especially beyond narrow tasks
such as random number or name generation, or beyond repeated sampling from a
single model. We introduce Infinity-Chat, a large-scale dataset of 26K diverse,
real-world, open-ended user queries that admit a wide range of plausible
answers with no single ground truth. We introduce the first comprehensive
taxonomy for characterizing the full spectrum of open-ended prompts posed to
LMs, comprising 6 top-level categories (e.g., brainstorm & ideation) that
further breaks down to 17 subcategories. Using Infinity-Chat, we present a
large-scale study of mode collapse in LMs, revealing a pronounced Artificial
Hivemind effect in open-ended generation of LMs, characterized by (1)
intra-model repetition, where a single model consistently generates similar
responses, and more so (2) inter-model homogeneity, where different models
produce strikingly similar outputs. Infinity-Chat also includes 31,250 human
annotations, across absolute ratings and pairwise preferences, with 25
independent human annotations per example. This enables studying collective and
individual-specific human preferences in response to open-ended queries. Our
findings show that LMs, reward models, and LM judges are less well calibrated
to human ratings on model generations that elicit differing idiosyncratic
annotator preferences, despite maintaining comparable overall quality. Overall,
INFINITY-CHAT presents the first large-scale resource for systematically
studying real-world open-ended queries to LMs, revealing critical insights to
guide future research for mitigating long-term AI safety risks posed by the
Artificial Hivemind.

TL;DR: 提出TAG（标记增强生成）方法，通过在长文本上下文中添加标签或标签定义，提升大语言模型在长上下文问答任务中的性能，无需改变文档完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在长复杂上下文中的问答和推理能力有限，RAG等方法依赖分块、嵌入和检索策略，需要大量预处理步骤，且对策略敏感。

Method: 使用轻量级数据增强策略TAG，在长上下文场景中为上下文添加标签或仅将标签定义加入问答提示，不改变文档结构和完整性。

Result: 在两个挑战性问答基准测试（NoLima和NovelQA）中，TAG方法相比基线带来一致性能提升：32K token上下文中提升达17%，复杂推理多跳查询中提升2.9%。

Conclusion: TAG是一种有效的轻量级方法，能显著提升LLM在长上下文问答任务中的表现，无需复杂的预处理步骤。

Abstract: Recent investigations into effective context lengths of modern flagship large
language models (LLMs) have revealed major limitations in effective question
answering (QA) and reasoning over long and complex contexts for even the
largest and most impressive cadre of models. While approaches like
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and chunk-based re-ranking attempt to
mitigate this issue, they are sensitive to chunking, embedding and retrieval
strategies and models, and furthermore, rely on extensive pre-processing,
knowledge acquisition and indexing steps. In this paper, we propose
Tagging-Augmented Generation (TAG), a lightweight data augmentation strategy
that boosts LLM performance in long-context scenarios, without degrading and
altering the integrity and composition of retrieved documents. We validate our
hypothesis by augmenting two challenging and directly relevant
question-answering benchmarks -- NoLima and NovelQA -- and show that tagging
the context or even just adding tag definitions into QA prompts leads to
consistent performance gains over the baseline -- up to 17% for 32K token
contexts, and 2.9% in complex reasoning question-answering for multi-hop
queries requiring knowledge across a wide span of text. Additional details are

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个系统化方法来评估长文本的事实准确性，包括构建中文长文本事实性数据集LongHalluQA、开发基于辩论的多智能体验证系统MAD-Fact，以及引入事实重要性层次结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在生物医学、法律和教育等高风险领域的广泛应用引发了对其输出事实准确性的担忧，现有评估方法在长文本上表现不佳。

Method: 构建LongHalluQA中文长文本事实性数据集；开发基于辩论的多智能体验证系统MAD-Fact；引入事实重要性层次结构来捕捉长文本中不同声明的重要性差异。

Result: 在两个基准测试上的实验表明，更大的LLM通常保持更高的事实一致性，而国产模型在中文内容上表现更优。

Conclusion: 该工作为评估和增强长文本LLM输出的事实可靠性提供了一个结构化框架，指导其在敏感领域的安全部署。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) raises critical
concerns about the factual accuracy of their outputs, especially in high-risk
domains such as biomedicine, law, and education. Existing evaluation methods
for short texts often fail on long-form content due to complex reasoning
chains, intertwined perspectives, and cumulative information. To address this,
we propose a systematic approach integrating large-scale long-form datasets,
multi-agent verification mechanisms, and weighted evaluation metrics. We
construct LongHalluQA, a Chinese long-form factuality dataset; and develop
MAD-Fact, a debate-based multi-agent verification system. We introduce a fact
importance hierarchy to capture the varying significance of claims in long-form
texts. Experiments on two benchmarks show that larger LLMs generally maintain
higher factual consistency, while domestic models excel on Chinese content. Our
work provides a structured framework for evaluating and enhancing factual
reliability in long-form LLM outputs, guiding their safe deployment in
sensitive domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 教育领域需要客观可扩展的教学质量测量方法，通用LLM在处理复杂的课堂观察工具时可靠性不足。

Method: 使用句子级嵌入架构构建定制LLM，系统评估五种句子嵌入方法，采用防止过拟合的数据高效训练机制，分析注释上下文窗口。

Result: 专业模型达到人类水平甚至超人类性能（专家评分相关性>0.65），高级模型更多关注课程级特征而非孤立话语，聚合模型分数与教师增值指标相关。

Conclusion: 建立了AI驱动教学测量的可行方法，为教育者发展提供可扩展、可靠有效的反馈路径，但模型尚未实现完全泛化。

Abstract: Objective and scalable measurement of teaching quality is a persistent
challenge in education. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential,
general-purpose models have struggled to reliably apply complex, authentic
classroom observation instruments. This paper uses custom LLMs built on
sentence-level embeddings, an architecture better suited for the long-form,
interpretive nature of classroom transcripts than conventional subword
tokenization. We systematically evaluate five different sentence embeddings
under a data-efficient training regime designed to prevent overfitting. Our
results demonstrate that these specialized models can achieve human-level and
even super-human performance with expert human ratings above 0.65 and
surpassing the average human-human rater correlation. Further, through analysis
of annotation context windows, we find that more advanced models-those better
aligned with human judgments-attribute a larger share of score variation to
lesson-level features rather than isolated utterances, challenging the
sufficiency of single-turn annotation paradigms. Finally, to assess external
validity, we find that aggregate model scores align with teacher value-added
measures, indicating they are capturing features relevant to student learning.
However, this trend does not hold at the individual item level, suggesting that
while the models learn useful signals, they have not yet achieved full
generalization. This work establishes a viable and powerful new methodology for
AI-driven instructional measurement, offering a path toward providing scalable,
reliable, and valid feedback for educator development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同架构大语言模型在上下文学习中的内部机制差异，特别是transformer、状态空间和混合模型在知识型任务中的表现。

Method: 结合行为探测和干预方法，分析不同架构LLM在上下文学习任务中的表现，特别关注功能向量在自注意力层和Mamba层中的分布。

Result: 发现负责上下文学习的功能向量主要位于自注意力层和Mamba层，Mamba2可能使用不同于功能向量的机制进行上下文学习。功能向量对涉及参数知识检索的上下文学习更重要，但对上下文知识理解不重要。

Conclusion: 不同架构的LLM在上下文学习中可能采用不同的内部机制，需要结合行为和机制分析来全面理解LLM能力，为跨架构和任务类型的理解提供更细致的视角。

Abstract: We perform in-depth evaluations of in-context learning (ICL) on
state-of-the-art transformer, state-space, and hybrid large language models
over two categories of knowledge-based ICL tasks. Using a combination of
behavioral probing and intervention-based methods, we have discovered that,
while LLMs of different architectures can behave similarly in task performance,
their internals could remain different. We discover that function vectors (FVs)
responsible for ICL are primarily located in the self-attention and Mamba
layers, and speculate that Mamba2 uses a different mechanism from FVs to
perform ICL. FVs are more important for ICL involving parametric knowledge
retrieval, but not for contextual knowledge understanding. Our work contributes
to a more nuanced understanding across architectures and task types.
Methodologically, our approach also highlights the importance of combining both
behavioural and mechanistic analyses to investigate LLM capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM评判器仅基于文本内在推理，难以验证复杂约束或进行精确计算，而工具集成推理在其他任务中已证明有效。

Method: 基于三个原则构建：跨可验证和不可验证领域的多样化训练、灵活的评判格式（点对点、成对、列表）、无需蒸馏的迭代强化学习。

Result: 在七个公共基准测试中，TIR-Judge比强推理型评判器提升6.4%（点对点）和7.7%（成对），列表性能与Claude-Opus-4相当但参数量仅8B。

Conclusion: 工具增强的评判器可以通过迭代强化学习自我进化，无需蒸馏轨迹就能达到蒸馏变体的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used as judges to evaluate response
quality, providing a scalable alternative to human evaluation. However, most
LLM judges operate solely on intrinsic text-based reasoning, limiting their
ability to verify complex constraints or perform accurate computation.
Motivated by the success of tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) in numerous tasks,
we propose TIR-Judge, an end-to-end RL framework for training LLM judges that
integrates a code executor for precise evaluation. TIR-Judge is built on three
principles: (i) diverse training across verifiable and non-verifiable domains,
(ii) flexible judgment formats (pointwise, pairwise, listwise), and (iii)
iterative RL that bootstraps directly from the initial model without
distillation. On seven public benchmarks, TIR-Judge surpasses strong
reasoning-based judges by up to 6.4% (pointwise) and 7.7% (pairwise), and
achieves listwise performance comparable to Claude-Opus-4 despite having only
8B parameters. Remarkably, TIR-Judge-Zero - trained entirely without distilled
judge trajectories, matches the performance of distilled variants,
demonstrating that tool-augmented judges can self-evolve through iterative
reinforcement learning.

TL;DR: 提出Knocking-Heads Attention (KHA)机制，通过共享对角初始化投影矩阵实现注意力头间的特征级交互，解决多头注意力中头间缺乏强交互的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多头注意力机制（包括标准MHA及其变体GQA、GTA）只是简单拼接孤立头的输出，缺乏头间的强交互，增加头数会削弱单个头的能力。

Method: 在缩放点积注意力之前，使用共享对角初始化投影矩阵让注意力头相互"敲击"，实现跨头特征级交互。对角初始化在训练初期保持头特异性，同时让模型逐步学习集成跨头表示。

Result: 在6.1B参数MoE模型（1.01B激活）上训练1T高质量token，相比基线注意力机制，KHA带来更优越和更稳定的训练动态，在下游任务中表现更好。

Conclusion: KHA以最小参数和FLOPs成本实现了注意力头间的有效交互，可无缝集成到各种注意力变体中，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Multi-head attention (MHA) has become the cornerstone of modern large
language models, enhancing representational capacity through parallel attention
heads. However, increasing the number of heads inherently weakens individual
head capacity, and existing attention mechanisms - whether standard MHA or its
variants like grouped-query attention (GQA) and grouped-tied attention (GTA) -
simply concatenate outputs from isolated heads without strong interaction. To
address this limitation, we propose knocking-heads attention (KHA), which
enables attention heads to "knock" on each other - facilitating cross-head
feature-level interactions before the scaled dot-product attention. This is
achieved by applying a shared, diagonally-initialized projection matrix across
all heads. The diagonal initialization preserves head-specific specialization
at the start of training while allowing the model to progressively learn
integrated cross-head representations. KHA adds only minimal parameters and
FLOPs and can be seamlessly integrated into MHA, GQA, GTA, and other attention
variants. We validate KHA by training a 6.1B parameter MoE model (1.01B
activated) on 1T high-quality tokens. Compared to baseline attention
mechanisms, KHA brings superior and more stable training dynamics, achieving
better performance across downstream tasks.

TL;DR: QTT-RAG通过显式评估翻译质量（语义等价性、语法准确性、自然流畅性）并附加质量分数作为元数据，在多语言检索增强生成中提升低资源语言的响应生成性能，同时保持事实完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有mRAG方法在低资源语言环境下依赖翻译英文文档，但翻译质量差会降低生成性能。现有方法要么假设翻译质量足够好，要么使用重写方法导致事实扭曲和幻觉。

Method: 提出QTT-RAG方法，从三个维度显式评估翻译质量：语义等价性、语法准确性、自然流畅性，并将这些分数作为元数据附加到原始内容上，不改变内容本身。

Result: 在两个开放域QA基准（XORQA、MKQA）上使用6个指令调优LLM（2.4B-14B参数）评估，涵盖韩语、芬兰语（低资源）和中文（高资源）。QTT-RAG优于CrossRAG和DKM-RAG基线，在保持事实完整性的同时让生成模型基于翻译可靠性做出明智决策。

Conclusion: QTT-RAG能够在低资源环境下有效利用跨语言文档，为多语言领域提供实用且鲁棒的解决方案，特别适用于本地语言文档有限的情况。

Abstract: Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) often retrieves English
documents and translates them into the query language for low-resource
settings. However, poor translation quality degrades response generation
performance. Existing approaches either assume sufficient translation quality
or utilize the rewriting method, which introduces factual distortion and
hallucinations. To mitigate these problems, we propose Quality-Aware
Translation Tagging in mRAG (QTT-RAG), which explicitly evaluates translation
quality along three dimensions-semantic equivalence, grammatical accuracy, and
naturalness&fluency-and attach these scores as metadata without altering the
original content. We evaluate QTT-RAG against CrossRAG and DKM-RAG as baselines
in two open-domain QA benchmarks (XORQA, MKQA) using six instruction-tuned LLMs
ranging from 2.4B to 14B parameters, covering two low-resource languages
(Korean and Finnish) and one high-resource language (Chinese). QTT-RAG
outperforms the baselines by preserving factual integrity while enabling
generator models to make informed decisions based on translation reliability.
This approach allows for effective usage of cross-lingual documents in
low-resource settings with limited native language documents, offering a
practical and robust solution across multilingual domains.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have highlighted the significant
benefits of multi-stage training, with a particular emphasis on the emergence
of mid-training as a vital stage that bridges pre-training and post-training.
Mid-training is distinguished by its use of intermediate data and computational
resources, systematically enhancing specified capabilities such as mathematics,
coding, reasoning, and long-context extension, while maintaining foundational
competencies. This survey provides a formal definition of mid-training for
large language models (LLMs) and investigates optimization frameworks that
encompass data curation, training strategies, and model architecture
optimization. We analyze mainstream model implementations in the context of
objective-driven interventions, illustrating how mid-training serves as a
distinct and critical stage in the progressive development of LLM capabilities.
By clarifying the unique contributions of mid-training, this survey offers a
comprehensive taxonomy and actionable insights, supporting future research and
innovation in the advancement of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAP4TS是一个多角度提示框架，将经典时间序列分析融入提示设计，通过全局域提示、局部域提示、统计提示和时序提示四个组件，结合原始时间序列嵌入，提升LLM在时间序列预测中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了时间序列数据特有的统计属性和时序依赖性，需要将经典时间序列分析融入提示设计来弥补这一差距。

Method: 提出四个专用提示组件：全局域提示（数据集级上下文）、局部域提示（近期趋势和序列特定行为）、统计提示和时序提示（基于自相关、偏自相关和傅里叶分析的手工洞察），通过跨模态对齐模块处理统一表示。

Result: 在8个不同数据集上的实验表明，MAP4TS持续优于最先进的基于LLM的方法，提示感知设计显著提升性能稳定性，GPT-2骨干网络在结构化提示下在长期预测任务中优于LLaMA等更大模型。

Conclusion: MAP4TS通过将经典时间序列分析融入提示设计，有效提升了LLM在时间序列预测中的性能，证明了结构化提示的重要性。

Abstract: Recent advances have investigated the use of pretrained large language models
(LLMs) for time-series forecasting by aligning numerical inputs with LLM
embedding spaces. However, existing multimodal approaches often overlook the
distinct statistical properties and temporal dependencies that are fundamental
to time-series data. To bridge this gap, we propose MAP4TS, a novel
Multi-Aspect Prompting Framework that explicitly incorporates classical
time-series analysis into the prompt design. Our framework introduces four
specialized prompt components: a Global Domain Prompt that conveys
dataset-level context, a Local Domain Prompt that encodes recent trends and
series-specific behaviors, and a pair of Statistical and Temporal Prompts that
embed handcrafted insights derived from autocorrelation (ACF), partial
autocorrelation (PACF), and Fourier analysis. Multi-Aspect Prompts are combined
with raw time-series embeddings and passed through a cross-modality alignment
module to produce unified representations, which are then processed by an LLM
and projected for final forecasting. Extensive experiments across eight diverse
datasets show that MAP4TS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based
methods. Our ablation studies further reveal that prompt-aware designs
significantly enhance performance stability and that GPT-2 backbones, when
paired with structured prompts, outperform larger models like LLaMA in
long-term forecasting tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究在医学多文档摘要任务中引入层次结构输入能否改善模型组织跨文档信息的能力。通过三种大语言模型和多种评估方法，发现层次结构方法能提高摘要清晰度并保持内容覆盖，同时人类专家更偏好模型生成的摘要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学多文档摘要是复杂任务，需要有效管理跨文档关系。传统平面摘要方法在组织跨文档信息方面存在局限，因此研究层次结构输入是否能改善模型的信息组织和上下文理解能力。

Method: 研究两种层次组织方法，在三种大语言模型上进行实验，使用自动指标、基于模型的指标和领域专家评估（偏好、可理解性、清晰度、复杂性、相关性、覆盖度、事实性和连贯性）进行综合评估。

Result: 人类专家更偏好模型生成的摘要而非人工撰写的摘要。层次方法通常能保持信息的事实性、覆盖度和连贯性，同时提高人类对摘要的偏好。GPT-4的模拟判断与人类判断在更客观的评估维度上具有更高一致性。

Conclusion: 层次结构可以改善模型生成的医学摘要的清晰度，同时保持内容覆盖，为提高生成摘要的人类偏好提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Medical multi-document summarization (MDS) is a complex task that requires
effectively managing cross-document relationships. This paper investigates
whether incorporating hierarchical structures in the inputs of MDS can improve
a model's ability to organize and contextualize information across documents
compared to traditional flat summarization methods. We investigate two ways of
incorporating hierarchical organization across three large language models
(LLMs), and conduct comprehensive evaluations of the resulting summaries using
automated metrics, model-based metrics, and domain expert evaluation of
preference, understandability, clarity, complexity, relevance, coverage,
factuality, and coherence. Our results show that human experts prefer
model-generated summaries over human-written summaries. Hierarchical approaches
generally preserve factuality, coverage, and coherence of information, while
also increasing human preference for summaries. Additionally, we examine
whether simulated judgments from GPT-4 align with human judgments, finding
higher agreement along more objective evaluation facets. Our findings
demonstrate that hierarchical structures can improve the clarity of medical
summaries generated by models while maintaining content coverage, providing a
practical way to improve human preference for generated summaries.

TL;DR: 提出了一种紧凑的单模型多语言词形变化方法，在73种语言上联合训练，性能优于单语言基线，简化了部署过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决缺乏开源、通用、多语言形态变化系统的问题，特别是能够处理未见词汇的系统，包括捷克语等广泛语言。

Method: 使用联合训练的单模型方法，在73种语言数据上训练，引入基于频率加权、词干分离的训练-开发-测试重采样程序。

Result: 模型轻量、对未见词汇鲁棒，在大多数语言中优于单语言基线，在SIGMORPHON共享任务和73个UD树库上表现良好。

Conclusion: 证明了多语言建模在词形变化任务中的有效性，具有简化部署的实用优势，所有代码已开源。

Abstract: We present a compact, single-model approach to multilingual inflection, the
task of generating inflected word forms from base lemmas to express grammatical
categories. Our model, trained jointly on data from 73 languages, is
lightweight, robust to unseen words, and outperforms monolingual baselines in
most languages. This demonstrates the effectiveness of multilingual modeling
for inflection and highlights its practical benefits: simplifying deployment by
eliminating the need to manage and retrain dozens of separate monolingual
models. In addition to the standard SIGMORPHON shared task benchmarks, we
evaluate our monolingual and multilingual models on 73 Universal Dependencies
(UD) treebanks, extracting lemma-tag-form triples and their frequency counts.
To ensure realistic data splits, we introduce a novel frequency-weighted,
lemma-disjoint train-dev-test resampling procedure. Our work addresses the lack
of an open-source, general-purpose, multilingual morphological inflection
system capable of handling unseen words across a wide range of languages,
including Czech. All code is publicly released at:

*Shiwei Li,Xiandi Luo,Haozhao Wang,Xing Tang,Ziqiang Cui,Dugang Liu,Yuhua Li,Xiuqiang He,Ruixuan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了TopLoRA方法，通过动态调整LoRA权重来学习token级别的输入-输出投影，解决了标准LoRA无法捕捉token特定信息的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准LoRA中所有输入token共享相同权重，限制了其捕捉token特定信息的能力，因为不同token之间存在语义差异。

Method: TopLoRA将LoRA权重表示为BΣ_X A，其中A和B是低秩矩阵，Σ_X是从每个输入token生成的对角矩阵，动态调整LoRA权重实现token级别的输入-输出投影。

Result: 在多个模型和数据集上的广泛实验表明，TopLoRA始终优于LoRA及其变体。

Conclusion: TopLoRA在不增加LoRA权重秩的情况下，通过学习token级别的LoRA权重实现了更细粒度的适应，提升了性能。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method
widely used in large language models (LLMs). LoRA essentially describes the
projection of an input space into a low-dimensional output space, with the
dimensionality determined by the LoRA rank. In standard LoRA, all input tokens
share the same weights and undergo an identical input-output projection. This
limits LoRA's ability to capture token-specific information due to the inherent
semantic differences among tokens. To address this limitation, we propose
Token-wise Projected Low-Rank Adaptation (TopLoRA), which dynamically adjusts
LoRA weights according to the input token, thereby learning token-wise
input-output projections in an end-to-end manner. Formally, the weights of
TopLoRA can be expressed as $B\Sigma_X A$, where $A$ and $B$ are low-rank
matrices (as in standard LoRA), and $\Sigma_X$ is a diagonal matrix generated
from each input token $X$. Notably, TopLoRA does not increase the rank of LoRA
weights but achieves more granular adaptation by learning token-wise LoRA
weights (i.e., token-wise input-output projections). Extensive experiments
across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that TopLoRA consistently
outperforms LoRA and its variants. The code is available at
https://github.com/Leopold1423/toplora-neurips25.

TL;DR: 该论文探索在形态学屈折任务中引入语料库频率信息，通过频率加权的训练-开发-测试分割、token准确率评估和频率感知训练方法，提升模型在实际部署中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统形态学屈折方法缺乏频率分布信息，而实际部署中用户输入会反映自然文本的真实频率分布，因此需要将频率信息纳入系统开发。

Method: 采用三种方法：频率加权的训练-开发-测试分割、token准确率评估替代传统type准确率、以及频率感知训练数据采样。

Result: 频率感知训练在43种语言中的26种语言上优于均匀采样方法。

Conclusion: 在形态学屈折任务中引入频率信息能够更好地反映实际部署场景，频率感知训练方法在多数语言中表现更优。

Abstract: The traditional approach to morphological inflection (the task of modifying a
base word (lemma) to express grammatical categories) has been, for decades, to
consider lexical entries of lemma-tag-form triples uniformly, lacking any
information about their frequency distribution. However, in production
deployment, one might expect the user inputs to reflect a real-world
distribution of frequencies in natural texts. With future deployment in mind,
we explore the incorporation of corpus frequency information into the task of
morphological inflection along three key dimensions during system development:
(i) for train-dev-test split, we combine a lemma-disjoint approach, which
evaluates the model's generalization capabilities, with a frequency-weighted
strategy to better reflect the realistic distribution of items across different
frequency bands in training and test sets; (ii) for evaluation, we complement
the standard type accuracy (often referred to simply as accuracy), which treats
all items equally regardless of frequency, with token accuracy, which assigns
greater weight to frequent words and better approximates performance on running
text; (iii) for training data sampling, we introduce a method novel in the
context of inflection, frequency-aware training, which explicitly incorporates
word frequency into the sampling process. We show that frequency-aware training
outperforms uniform sampling in 26 out of 43 languages.

TL;DR: ENTP框架通过神经符号方法净化低质量SFT数据，仅使用低质量数据构建的数据集在多个基准测试中超越了13种现有数据选择方法和完整原始数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SFT方法只关注高质量数据，忽略了低质量数据中的有价值信号，且依赖不完美的质量过滤器。

Method: ENTP框架包含符号净化模块（基于统计先验识别和修剪噪声样本）和神经重建模块（利用潜在表示和模型知识合成丰富的指令-响应对）。

Result: 仅使用低质量数据构建的ENTP增强数据集在五个指令跟随基准测试中超越了13种现有数据选择方法，甚至优于在完整原始数据集（约30万样本）上的微调。

Conclusion: 低质量数据具有未开发的潜力，智能净化和合成对于高效的指令对齐至关重要。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) adapts pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs)
to domain-specific instructions by training on a carefully curated subset of
high-quality instruction-response pairs, typically drawn from a larger dataset
that often contains many low-quality or noisy samples. However, existing
quality-first paradigms often overlook valuable signals in discarded
low-quality data and rely on imperfect quality filters. We introduce ENTP
(Enhancing low-quality SFT data via Neural-symbolic Text Purge-Mix), a
framework that revitalizes low-quality corpora through symbolic purification
and neural reconstruction. The symbolic module identifies and prunes noisy
samples based on statistical priors, while the neural component synthesizes
enriched instruction-response pairs by leveraging latent representations and
model knowledge. This neural-symbolic synergy enhances data informativeness and
diversity. Experiments show that ENTP-augmented datasets, constructed
exclusively from low-quality data, outperform 13 established data-selection
baselines across five instruction-following benchmarks, and even surpass
fine-tuning on the full original dataset (approximately 300K examples). Our
results highlight the untapped potential of low-quality data and underscore the
importance of intelligent purification and synthesis for efficient instruction
alignment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了双阶段精炼（DSR）框架，将创意叙事生成与格式转换解耦，通过分解生成架构和定制数据合成，使LLM能够生成高质量剧本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端生成方法无法同时掌握创意叙事构建和严格格式遵循两种能力，导致生成的剧本缺乏深度结构完整性和故事实质。

Method: 使用双阶段精炼框架：第一阶段将简要大纲转换为丰富的散文式叙述；第二阶段将叙述精炼为专业格式的剧本。采用混合数据合成解决训练数据稀缺问题。

Result: 专业编剧盲评显示，DSR对Gemini-2.5-Pro等强基线达到75%胜率，达到人类水平表现的82.7%。

Conclusion: 分解生成架构结合定制数据合成能有效使LLM在复杂创意领域专业化。

Abstract: The screenplay serves as the foundation for television production, defining
narrative structure, character development, and dialogue. While Large Language
Models (LLMs) show great potential in creative writing, direct end-to-end
generation approaches often fail to produce well-crafted screenplays. We argue
this failure stems from forcing a single model to simultaneously master two
disparate capabilities: creative narrative construction and rigid format
adherence. The resulting outputs may mimic superficial style but lack the deep
structural integrity and storytelling substance required for professional use.
To enable LLMs to generate high-quality screenplays, we introduce Dual-Stage
Refinement (DSR), a decomposed framework that decouples creative narrative
generation from format conversion. The first stage transforms a brief outline
into rich, novel-style prose. The second stage refines this narrative into a
professionally formatted screenplay. This separation enables the model to
specialize in one distinct capability at each stage. A key challenge in
implementing DSR is the scarcity of paired outline-to-novel training data. We
address this through hybrid data synthesis: reverse synthesis deconstructs
existing screenplays into structured inputs, while forward synthesis leverages
these inputs to generate high-quality narrative texts as training targets.
Blind evaluations by professional screenwriters show that DSR achieves a 75%
win rate against strong baselines like Gemini-2.5-Pro and reaches 82.7% of
human-level performance. Our work demonstrates that decomposed generation
architecture with tailored data synthesis effectively specializes LLMs in
complex creative domains.

TL;DR: MATCH是一个新的无参考代码生成评估指标，通过对比学习生成代码和自然语言任务描述的嵌入向量，用于评估生成代码与开发者意图的匹配程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI代码生成日益普及，但准确评估生成代码与开发者意图的匹配度仍具挑战性。传统评估方法（如单元测试）成本高且难以扩展，现有指标无法有效捕捉代码功能或需要参考代码。

Method: 使用对比学习生成代码和自然语言任务描述的有意义嵌入向量，通过相似性评分来反映生成代码实现任务的程度。

Result: MATCH在多种编程语言中与功能正确性和人类偏好的相关性均优于现有指标。

Conclusion: MATCH提供了一种有效的无参考代码生成评估方法，能够更好地衡量生成代码与开发者意图的匹配度。

Abstract: AI-based code generation is increasingly prevalent, with GitHub Copilot
estimated to generate 46% of the code on GitHub. Accurately evaluating how well
generated code aligns with developer intent remains a critical challenge.
Traditional evaluation methods, such as unit tests, are often unscalable and
costly. Syntactic similarity metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) fail to capture code
functionality, and metrics like CodeBERTScore require reference code, which is
not always available. To address the gap in reference-free evaluation, with few
alternatives such as ICE-Score, this paper introduces MATCH, a novel
reference-free metric. MATCH uses Contrastive Learning to generate meaningful
embeddings for code and natural language task descriptions, enabling similarity
scoring that reflects how well generated code implements the task. We show that
MATCH achieves stronger correlations with functional correctness and human
preference than existing metrics across multiple programming languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SI-Bench是一个评估大语言模型社会智能的新基准，包含2,221个真实多轮对话，实验显示SOTA模型在复杂社交情境推理上超越人类专家，但在回复质量上仍落后于人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型发展出拟人化能力，它们越来越多地被部署为与人类互动的自主代理。然而，在现实复杂社交互动中评估其性能仍是一个重大挑战，现有数据集大多通过模拟代理间交互构建，无法捕捉真实人类对话的语言风格和关系动态。

Method: 基于广泛的社会科学理论，SI-Bench包含从社交网络应用收集的2,221个真实多轮对话，并进一步选取312个对话在8个主要模型上进行人工标注。

Result: 实验表明，SOTA模型在复杂社交情境的过程推理方面超越了人类专家，但在回复质量上仍落后于人类。此外，引入思维链推理可能会降低LLM在社交对话任务中的表现。

Conclusion: SI-Bench为评估LLM的社会智能提供了重要基准，揭示了当前模型在社交推理和回复质量方面的差距，所有数据集已开源。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) develop anthropomorphic abilities, they are
increasingly being deployed as autonomous agents to interact with humans.
However, evaluating their performance in realistic and complex social
interactions remains a significant challenge. Most previous research built
datasets through simulated agent-to-agent interactions, which fails to capture
the authentic linguistic styles and relational dynamics found in real human
conversations. To address this gap, we introduce SI-Bench, a novel benchmark
designed to evaluate aspects of social intelligence in LLMs. Grounded in broad
social science theories, SI-Bench contains 2,221 authentic multi-turn dialogues
collected from a social networking application. We further selected a subset of
312 dialogues for manual annotation across 8 major models. The experiments show
that SOTA models have surpassed the human expert in process reasoning under
complex social situations, yet they still fall behind humans in reply quality.
Moreover, introducing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning may degrade the
performance of LLMs in social dialogue tasks. All datasets are openly available
at https://github.com/SI-Bench/SI-Bench.git.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 药物关系抽取对识别药物相互作用和预测副作用至关重要，但该领域缺乏专门的数据集，需要采用迁移学习。

Method: 首先使用训练好的关系抽取模型发现实体间关系，然后应用于医学文本语料库构建药物关系本体，最后用大语言模型验证抽取结果。

Result: 定量结果显示LLM对PubMed摘要子集中抽取的71%关系表示同意，定性分析表明该方法能揭示医学领域中的歧义性。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效构建药物关系本体，同时揭示了医学领域关系抽取面临的挑战。

Abstract: Relation extraction between drugs plays a crucial role in identifying drug
drug interactions and predicting side effects. The advancement of machine
learning methods in relation extraction, along with the development of large
medical text databases, has enabled the low cost extraction of such relations
compared to other approaches that typically require expert knowledge. However,
to the best of our knowledge, there are limited datasets specifically designed
for drug drug relation extraction currently available. Therefore, employing
transfer learning becomes necessary to apply machine learning methods in this
domain. In this study, we propose DREAM, a method that first employs a trained
relation extraction model to discover relations between entities and then
applies this model to a corpus of medical texts to construct an ontology of
drug relationships. The extracted relations are subsequently validated using a
large language model. Quantitative results indicate that the LLM agreed with 71
of the relations extracted from a subset of PubMed abstracts. Furthermore, our
qualitative analysis indicates that this approach can uncover ambiguities in
the medical domain, highlighting the challenges inherent in relation extraction
in this field.

TL;DR: 提出了一种句子级别的过程奖励模型（PRM），用于检测大型视觉语言模型在生成放射学报告时产生的临床关键幻觉，该模型在多个指标上优于现有方法，并展现出良好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在自动化生成放射学报告方面具有巨大潜力，但这些模型经常产生临床关键幻觉，带来严重风险。现有幻觉检测方法缺乏足够的句子级粒度或对不同LVLM生成器的鲁棒泛化能力。

Method: 引入了一种新颖的句子级别过程奖励模型（PRM），适应视觉语言任务。该模型基于临床上下文和先前文本预测每个生成句子的真实性，在MIMIC-CXR数据集上使用弱监督标签进行微调。

Result: 轻量级的0.5B参数PRM在多个指标上优于现有验证技术，例如在Matthews相关系数上相对提升7.5%，AUROC相对提升1.8%。PRM在未见过的LVLM上展现出强泛化能力，并能有效过滤低质量报告，将F1-CheXbert分数提高4.5%。

Conclusion: 轻量级、上下文感知的PRM为临床LVLM提供了一个模型无关的安全层，无需访问内部激活，显著提升了放射学报告生成的可靠性和安全性。

Abstract: Automating radiology report generation with Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) holds great potential, yet these models often produce clinically
critical hallucinations, posing serious risks. Existing hallucination detection
methods frequently lack the necessary sentence-level granularity or robust
generalization across different LVLM generators. We introduce a novel approach:
a sentence-level Process Reward Model (PRM) adapted for this vision-language
task. Our PRM predicts the factual correctness of each generated sentence,
conditioned on clinical context and preceding text. When fine-tuned on
MIMIC-CXR with weakly-supervised labels, a lightweight 0.5B-parameter PRM
outperforms existing verification techniques, demonstrating, for instance,
relative improvements of 7.5% in Matthews Correlation Coefficient and 1.8% in
AUROC over strong white-box baselines on outputs from one LVLM. Unlike methods
reliant on internal model states, our PRM demonstrates strong generalization to
an unseen LVLM. We further show its practical utility: PRM scores effectively
filter low-quality reports, improving F1-CheXbert scores by 4.5% (when
discarding the worst 10% of reports). Moreover, when guiding a novel weighted
best-of-N selection process on the MIMIC-CXR test set, our PRM show relative
improvements in clinical metrics of 7.4% for F1-CheXbert and 0.6% for
BERTScore. These results demonstrate that a lightweight, context-aware PRM
provides a model-agnostic safety layer for clinical LVLMs without access to
internal activations

Conclusion: 方言变异对ASR构成重大挑战，Ben-10数据集可作为资源受限条件下ASR建模的分布外资源。

Abstract: Conventional research on speech recognition modeling relies on the canonical
form for most low-resource languages while automatic speech recognition (ASR)
for regional dialects is treated as a fine-tuning task. To investigate the
effects of dialectal variations on ASR we develop a 78-hour annotated Bengali
Speech-to-Text (STT) corpus named Ben-10. Investigation from linguistic and
data-driven perspectives shows that speech foundation models struggle heavily
in regional dialect ASR, both in zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We observe
that all deep learning methods struggle to model speech data under dialectal
variations but dialect specific model training alleviates the issue. Our
dataset also serves as a out of-distribution (OOD) resource for ASR modeling
under constrained resources in ASR algorithms. The dataset and code developed

Abstract: Mubeen is a proprietary Arabic language model developed by MASARAT SA,
optimized for deep understanding of Arabic linguistics, Islamic studies, and
cultural heritage. Trained on an extensive collection of authentic Arabic
sources significantly expanded by digitizing historical manuscripts via a
proprietary Arabic OCR engine, the model incorporates seminal scholarly works
in linguistics, jurisprudence, hadith, and Quranic exegesis, alongside
thousands of academic theses and peer-reviewed research papers. Conditioned
through a deep linguistic engineering framework, Mubeen masters not just the
meaning but the eloquence of Arabic, enabling precise understanding across
classical texts, contemporary writing, and regional dialects with focus on
comprehending user intent and delivering accurate, contextually relevant
responses. Unlike other Arabic models relying on translated English data that
often fail in intent detection or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), Mubeen
uses native Arabic sources to ensure cultural authenticity and accuracy. Its
core innovation is the Practical Closure Architecture, designed to solve the
"Utility Gap Crisis" where factually correct answers fail to resolve users'
core needs, forcing them into frustrating cycles of re-prompting. By
prioritizing clarity and decisive guidance, Mubeen transforms from an
information repository into a decisive guide, aligning with Saudi Vision 2030.
The model's architecture combines deep heritage specialization with
multi-disciplinary expert modules, enabling robust performance across both
cultural preservation and general knowledge domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新流程来提升LLM生成代码的美学质量，包括构建AesCode-358K数据集、多智能体奖励反馈系统GRPO-AR算法，并在OpenDesign基准测试中取得显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在传统编程任务中表现出色，但在视觉导向的编码任务中美学质量较差，需要专门优化代码美观度。

Method: 构建AesCode-358K指令调优数据集；提出多智能体奖励反馈系统评估可执行性、静态美学和交互美学；开发GRPO-AR算法联合优化功能性和代码美学；创建OpenDesign评估基准。

Result: 在AesCode-358K上进行监督微调并结合强化学习的多智能体奖励反馈，在OpenDesign基准上表现显著提升，在PandasPlotBench等现有基准上也有改进。AesCoder-4B超越GPT-4o和GPT-4.1，性能与480B-685B参数的大型开源模型相当。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了LLM生成代码的美学质量，证明了专门针对代码美学的优化策略的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become valuable assistants for developers
in code-related tasks. While LLMs excel at traditional programming tasks such
as code generation and bug fixing, they struggle with visually-oriented coding
tasks, often producing suboptimal aesthetics. In this paper, we introduce a new
pipeline to enhance the aesthetic quality of LLM-generated code. We first
construct AesCode-358K, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset focused on
code aesthetics. Next, we propose agentic reward feedback, a multi-agent system
that evaluates executability, static aesthetics, and interactive aesthetics.
Building on this, we develop GRPO-AR, which integrates these signals into the
GRPO algorithm for joint optimization of functionality and code aesthetics.
Finally, we develop OpenDesign, a benchmark for assessing code aesthetics.
Experimental results show that combining supervised fine-tuning on AesCode-358K
with reinforcement learning using agentic reward feedback significantly
improves performance on OpenDesign and also enhances results on existing
benchmarks such as PandasPlotBench. Notably, our AesCoder-4B surpasses GPT-4o
and GPT-4.1, and achieves performance comparable to large open-source models
with 480B-685B parameters, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 第九届CHiME挑战赛引入多模态上下文感知识别任务，解决单房间环境中重叠对话的鸡尾酒会问题，使用音频、视觉和上下文线索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自然多参与者对话中的极端语音重叠问题，实现100%重叠情况下的说话人识别和对话聚类。

Method: 通过音频-视觉记录联合转录每个说话人的语音，并将其聚类到各自的对话中，利用多模态信息提升识别效果。

Result: 纯音频基线词错误率超过100%，加入视觉线索后性能提升50%，证明多模态方法的重要性。

Conclusion: 多模态上下文感知识别是解决极端语音重叠问题的有效方法，视觉信息对性能提升至关重要。

Abstract: We introduce the task of Multi-Modal Context-Aware Recognition (MCoRec) in
the ninth CHiME Challenge, which addresses the cocktail-party problem of
overlapping conversations in a single-room setting using audio, visual, and
contextual cues. MCoRec captures natural multi-party conversations where the
recordings focus on unscripted, casual group chats, leading to extreme speech
overlap of up to 100% and highly fragmented conversational turns. The task
requires systems to answer the question "Who speaks when, what, and with whom?"
by jointly transcribing each speaker's speech and clustering them into their
respective conversations from audio-visual recordings. Audio-only baselines
exceed 100% word error rate, whereas incorporating visual cues yields
substantial 50% improvements, highlighting the importance of multi-modality. In
this manuscript, we present the motivation behind the task, outline the data
collection process, and report the baseline systems developed for the MCoRec.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个完全自动化的数据为中心的方法，用于文本到SQL任务，包括自适应数据修复和错误数据增强，并结合多模型协作训练和集成策略，在轻量级模型中取得了最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于代理的框架在文本到SQL任务中取得了显著改进，但数据为中心策略的影响很少被探索。现有单一微调模型的能力有限，需要更有效的数据处理和多模型协作方法。

Method: 设计了完全自动化的数据为中心流水线：自适应数据修复（自动发现和修复训练数据错误）、错误数据增强（扩散和增强模型预测的错误数据）、多模型协作训练（用不同增强数据训练多个模型）、集成策略（整合多个模型能力解决多选题）。

Result: 实验结果表明数据为中心流水线和多模型交互迭代策略有效，在轻量级文本到SQL模型（70B以内）中取得了第一名的成绩。

Conclusion: 数据为中心的方法和多模型协作策略显著提升了文本到SQL任务的性能，证明了数据质量处理和模型多样性在解决复杂任务中的重要性。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL tasks have gained attractive improvements since the release of
ChatGPT. Among them, agent-based frameworks have been widely used in this
field. However, the impact of data-centric strategies on text-to-SQL tasks has
rarely been explored. In this paper, we systemically design a fully automated
data-centric pipeline for text-to-SQL tasks, including \emph{adaptive data
repair}, which can automatically find and fix errors in the training dataset;
and \emph{error data augmentation}, where we specifically diffuse and enhance
erroneous data predicted by the initially trained models. Meanwhile, we propose
a Multi-Model collaboration training schema, aiming to train multiple models
with different augmented data, enabling them to possess distinct capabilities
and work together to complement each other, because it has been found that the
capability of a single fine-tuned model is very limited. Furthermore, we
utilize an ensemble strategy to integrate the capabilities of multiple models
to solve a multiple-choice question, aiming to further improve the accuracy of
text-to-SQL tasks. The experiment results and ablation study have demonstrated
the effectiveness of data-centric pipeline and Multi-Model(MM) interactive
iterative strategies, achieving first place in lightweight text-to-SQL models
(within 70B).

TL;DR: 提出了Arabic Little STT数据集，包含288名6-13岁儿童的355条黎凡特阿拉伯语语音，评估了Whisper模型在儿童语音识别上的表现，发现其词错误率高达0.66，远高于成人语音的0.20以下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决阿拉伯语等低资源语言中儿童语音数据稀缺的问题，填补儿童特定语音语料库的空白。

Method: 创建Arabic Little STT儿童语音数据集，系统评估8个Whisper变体模型在该数据集上的表现，并与成人阿拉伯语基准进行比较。

Result: 即使是表现最好的Whisper Large_v3模型在儿童语音上的词错误率也高达0.66，而成人数据集上的词错误率低于0.20，与英语语音研究结果一致。

Conclusion: 强调在ASR开发中需要专门的儿童语音基准和包容性训练数据，这些数据必须受到严格的伦理和隐私框架保护，以保护敏感的儿童信息。

Abstract: The performance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems fundamentally depends
on high-quality training data. However, low-resource languages like Arabic
suffer from severe data scarcity. Moreover, the absence of child-specific
speech corpora is an essential gap that poses significant challenges. To
address this gap, we present our created dataset, Arabic Little STT, a dataset
of Levantine Arabic child speech recorded in classrooms, containing 355
utterances from 288 children (ages 6 - 13). We further conduct a systematic
assessment of Whisper, a state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR)
model, on this dataset and compare its performance with adult Arabic
benchmarks. Our evaluation across eight Whisper variants reveals that even the
best-performing model (Large_v3) struggles significantly, achieving a 0.66 word
error rate (WER) on child speech, starkly contrasting with its sub 0.20 WER on
adult datasets. These results align with other research on English speech.
Results highlight the critical need for dedicated child speech benchmarks and
inclusive training data in ASR development. Emphasizing that such data must be
governed by strict ethical and privacy frameworks to protect sensitive child
information. We hope that this study provides an initial step for future work
on equitable speech technologies for Arabic-speaking children. We hope that our
publicly available dataset enrich the children's demographic representation in
ASR datasets.

TL;DR: AdaSearch是一种新颖的块状搜索策略，通过自适应分配固定计算预算，专注于关键初始token，在LLM对齐任务中显著优于Best-of-N和微调基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM对齐仍然是一个关键挑战。推理时方法提供了比微调更灵活的替代方案，但其均匀的计算努力通常产生次优对齐效果。我们假设对于许多对齐任务，响应的初始token更为关键。

Method: 引入AdaSearch，一种新颖的块状搜索策略。它使用采样计划自适应分配固定计算预算，将搜索努力集中在这些关键token上。还应用AdaSearch到顺序解码，并引入其树搜索对应物AdaBeam。

Result: 在八个LLM上的全面评估表明，AdaSearch优于强大的Best-of-N和微调基线。具体来说，在无害生成、受控情感生成和数学推理任务中，相对于Best-of-N，胜率提高了超过10%。

Conclusion: AdaSearch通过专注于关键初始token的自适应计算分配，在LLM对齐任务中取得了显著改进，证明了推理时方法的有效性。

Abstract: LLM alignment remains a critical challenge. Inference-time methods provide a
flexible alternative to fine-tuning, but their uniform computational effort
often yields suboptimal alignment. We hypothesize that for many alignment
tasks, the initial tokens of a response are disproportionately more critical.
To leverage this principle, we introduce AdaSearch, a novel blockwise search
strategy. It adaptively allocates a fixed computational budget using a sampling
schedule, focusing search effort on these critical tokens. We apply AdaSearch
to sequential decoding and introduce its tree-search counterpart, AdaBeam. Our
comprehensive evaluation across eight LLMs demonstrates that AdaSearch
outperforms strong Best-of-N and fine-tuning baselines. Specifically, win-rates
improve by over 10% for harmlessness generation, controlled sentiment
generation, and for mathematical reasoning tasks relative to Best-of-N.

TL;DR: 提出了首个基于八字命理的人格推理QA数据集和BaZi-LLM系统，通过符号推理与大语言模型结合生成动态细粒度虚拟人格，相比主流LLM准确率提升30.3%-62.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前虚拟角色生成方法依赖标注数据或人工设定，难以扩展且缺乏真实性和上下文连贯性，需要结合文化背景知识来创建更真实的虚拟人格。

Method: 创建八字命理人格推理QA数据集，将人类经验分类为财富、健康、亲属、职业和关系等维度，提出BaZi-LLM系统整合符号推理与大语言模型。

Result: 相比DeepSeek-v3和GPT-5-mini等主流LLM，准确率提升30.3%-62.6%；当使用错误八字信息时，模型准确率下降20%-45%。

Conclusion: 基于文化根基的符号-LLM整合在真实角色模拟方面具有潜力，能够生成时间动态和细粒度的虚拟人格。

Abstract: Human-like virtual characters are crucial for games, storytelling, and
virtual reality, yet current methods rely heavily on annotated data or
handcrafted persona prompts, making it difficult to scale up and generate
realistic, contextually coherent personas. We create the first QA dataset for
BaZi-based persona reasoning, where real human experiences categorized into
wealth, health, kinship, career, and relationships are represented as
life-event questions and answers. Furthermore, we propose the first BaZi-LLM
system that integrates symbolic reasoning with large language models to
generate temporally dynamic and fine-grained virtual personas. Compared with
mainstream LLMs such as DeepSeek-v3 and GPT-5-mini, our method achieves a
30.3%-62.6% accuracy improvement. In addition, when incorrect BaZi information
is used, our model's accuracy drops by 20%-45%, showing the potential of
culturally grounded symbolic-LLM integration for realistic character
simulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量知识图谱的稀缺是AI应用的关键瓶颈，现有提取方法依赖错误率高的模式匹配或资源密集型大语言模型，计算需求限制了在低资源环境中的可访问性。

Method: 提出LightKGG框架：1) 上下文集成图提取，将上下文信息与节点和边集成到统一图结构中；2) 拓扑增强关系推断，利用提取图的固有拓扑高效推断关系。

Result: 该框架能够在最小硬件需求下实现准确的知识图谱构建，减少对复杂语义处理和LLM语言理解能力的依赖。

Conclusion: 这项工作弥合了自动化知识提取与实际部署场景之间的差距，并为在结构化NLP任务中优化SLM效率引入了科学严谨的方法。

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality knowledge graphs (KGs) remains a critical
bottleneck for downstream AI applications, as existing extraction methods rely
heavily on error-prone pattern-matching techniques or resource-intensive large
language models (LLMs). While recent tools leverage LLMs to generate KGs, their
computational demands limit accessibility for low-resource environments. Our
paper introduces LightKGG, a novel framework that enables efficient KG
extraction from textual data using small-scale language models (SLMs) through
two key technical innovations: (1) Context-integrated Graph extraction
integrates contextual information with nodes and edges into a unified graph
structure, reducing the reliance on complex semantic processing while
maintaining more key information; (2) Topology-enhanced relationship inference
leverages the inherent topology of the extracted graph to efficiently infer
relationships, enabling relationship discovery without relying on complex
language understanding capabilities of LLMs. By enabling accurate KG
construction with minimal hardware requirements, this work bridges the gap
between automated knowledge extraction and practical deployment scenarios while
introducing scientifically rigorous methods for optimizing SLM efficiency in
structured NLP tasks.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个评估大语言模型预测AI对就业影响能力的基准，结合了美国部门级职位发布数据和全球AI采用导致的职业变化预测数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能正在重塑劳动力市场，但缺乏系统预测AI对就业影响的工具。现有研究显示LLMs能够提取情感、总结经济报告和模拟预测者行为，但很少评估其在劳动力预测中的应用。

Method: 结合两个互补数据集：美国部门级高频职位发布指数和全球AI采用导致的职业变化预测数据，构建具有明确时间分割的预测任务。使用多种提示策略评估LLMs，包括任务支架、角色驱动和混合方法。

Result: 结构化任务提示持续提高预测稳定性，角色提示在短期趋势上具有优势。但性能在不同部门和预测时间跨度上差异显著，凸显了领域感知提示和严格评估协议的必要性。

Conclusion: 该基准支持未来关于劳动力预测、提示设计和基于LLM的经济推理研究，为研究AI作为劳动力市场预测工具的局限性和机会提供了可复现的测试平台。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is reshaping labor markets, yet we lack tools to
systematically forecast its effects on employment. This paper introduces a
benchmark for evaluating how well large language models (LLMs) can anticipate
changes in job demand, especially in occupations affected by AI. Existing
research has shown that LLMs can extract sentiment, summarize economic reports,
and emulate forecaster behavior, but little work has assessed their use for
forward-looking labor prediction. Our benchmark combines two complementary
datasets: a high-frequency index of sector-level job postings in the United
States, and a global dataset of projected occupational changes due to AI
adoption. We format these data into forecasting tasks with clear temporal
splits, minimizing the risk of information leakage. We then evaluate LLMs using
multiple prompting strategies, comparing task-scaffolded, persona-driven, and
hybrid approaches across model families. We assess both quantitative accuracy
and qualitative consistency over time. Results show that structured task
prompts consistently improve forecast stability, while persona prompts offer
advantages on short-term trends. However, performance varies significantly
across sectors and horizons, highlighting the need for domain-aware prompting
and rigorous evaluation protocols. By releasing our benchmark, we aim to
support future research on labor forecasting, prompt design, and LLM-based
economic reasoning. This work contributes to a growing body of research on how
LLMs interact with real-world economic data, and provides a reproducible
testbed for studying the limits and opportunities of AI as a forecasting tool
in the context of labor markets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 宗教语言在当代话语中持续存在，甚至在环境活动和气候变化辩论等表面世俗的领域中也很普遍。研究旨在探索宗教和非宗教非政府组织在气候相关文本中使用的显性和隐性宗教语言。

Method: 采用双重方法：基于生态神学文献构建的宗教术语层次树的规则模型，以及在零样本设置下运行的大型语言模型。使用包含88万多句子的数据集进行比较分析。

Result: 结果显示，基于规则的方法比大型语言模型更频繁地将句子标记为宗教性。这突显了计算检测宗教语言的方法学挑战。

Conclusion: 研究不仅展示了分析宗教语言在气候话语中持续存在的潜力，也揭示了仅通过词汇定义宗教语言还是需要考虑上下文意义的更广泛张力。

Abstract: Religious language continues to permeate contemporary discourse, even in
ostensibly secular domains such as environmental activism and climate change
debates. This paper investigates how explicit and implicit forms of religious
language appear in climate-related texts produced by secular and religious
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). We introduce a dual methodological
approach: a rule-based model using a hierarchical tree of religious terms
derived from ecotheology literature, and large language models (LLMs) operating
in a zero-shot setting. Using a dataset of more than 880,000 sentences, we
compare how these methods detect religious language and analyze points of
agreement and divergence. The results show that the rule-based method
consistently labels more sentences as religious than LLMs. These findings
highlight not only the methodological challenges of computationally detecting
religious language but also the broader tension over whether religious language
should be defined by vocabulary alone or by contextual meaning. This study
contributes to digital methods in religious studies by demonstrating both the
potential and the limitations of approaches for analyzing how the sacred
persists in climate discourse.

Conclusion: 通过整合多种互补的时序预测模型，基于MoE框架的方法能够有效应对时序数据对近期历史更敏感和存在不可预测事件的特点，实现了当前最优的预测性能。

Abstract: The immense success of the Transformer architecture
  in Natural Language Processing has led to its adoption in Time Se ries
Forecasting (TSF), where superior performance has been shown.
  However, a recent important paper questioned their effectiveness by
  demonstrating that a simple single layer linear model outperforms
  Transformer-based models. This was soon shown to be not as valid,
  by a better transformer-based model termed PatchTST. More re cently, TimeLLM
demonstrated even better results by repurposing a
  Large Language Model (LLM) for the TSF domain. Again, a follow
  up paper challenged this by demonstrating that removing the LLM
  component or replacing it with a basic attention layer in fact yields
  better performance. One of the challenges in forecasting is the fact
  that TSF data favors the more recent past, and is sometimes subject
  to unpredictable events. Based upon these recent insights in TSF, we
  propose a strong Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework. Our method
  combines the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models including xLSTM, en hanced
Linear, PatchTST, and minGRU, among others. This set of
  complimentary and diverse models for TSF are integrated in a Trans former
based MoE gating network. Our proposed model outperforms
  all existing TSF models on standard benchmarks, surpassing even the
  latest approaches based on MoE frameworks.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning AI behaviors with human
preferences, yet they face two fundamental challenges: (1) Modality Imbalance,
where most RMs are mainly focused on text and image modalities, offering
limited support for video, audio, and other modalities; and (2) Preference
Rigidity, where training on fixed binary preference pairs fails to capture the
complexity and diversity of personalized preferences. To address the above
challenges, we propose Omni-Reward, a step toward generalist omni-modal reward
modeling with support for free-form preferences, consisting of: (1) Evaluation:
We introduce Omni-RewardBench, the first omni-modal RM benchmark with free-form
preferences, covering nine tasks across five modalities including text, image,
video, audio, and 3D; (2) Data: We construct Omni-RewardData, a multimodal
preference dataset comprising 248K general preference pairs and 69K
instruction-tuning pairs for training generalist omni-modal RMs; (3) Model: We
propose Omni-RewardModel, which includes both discriminative and generative
RMs, and achieves strong performance on Omni-RewardBench as well as other
widely used reward modeling benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注单轮场景下的置信度，而在复杂多轮交互中的置信度研究有限，需要探索LLM搜索代理在长时间动作序列后表达置信度的能力。

Method: 在开源代理模型上进行实验，发现模型在高置信度时任务准确率更高，基于此提出了测试时缩放方法，使用置信度分数确定答案质量，鼓励模型达到满意置信度水平。

Result: 模型在高置信度时表现出更高的任务准确率，而低置信度时准确率接近零；提出的方法显著减少了token消耗，同时与基线固定预算方法相比表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: LLM搜索代理能够通过语言化置信度分数有效表达不确定性，基于置信度的测试时缩放方法在保持性能的同时显著提高了效率。

Abstract: Confidence in LLMs is a useful indicator of model uncertainty and answer
reliability. Existing work mainly focused on single-turn scenarios, while
research on confidence in complex multi-turn interactions is limited. In this
paper, we investigate whether LLM-based search agents have the ability to
communicate their own confidence through verbalized confidence scores after
long sequences of actions, a significantly more challenging task compared to
outputting confidence in a single interaction. Experimenting on open-source
agentic models, we first find that models exhibit much higher task accuracy at
high confidence while having near-zero accuracy when confidence is low. Based
on this observation, we propose Test-Time Scaling (TTS) methods that use
confidence scores to determine answer quality, encourage the model to try again
until reaching a satisfactory confidence level. Results show that our proposed
methods significantly reduce token consumption while demonstrating competitive
performance compared to baseline fixed budget TTS methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SEC文件和财报电话会议记录中的金融叙述对投资者很重要，但其长度和专业术语使得细粒度分析困难，且传统方法需要大量标注数据。

Method: 从10-K年报和财报电话会议记录中提取句子，使用ChatGPT-o3-pro模型标注立场（正面、负面、中性），并系统评估LLM的零样本、少样本和思维链提示策略。

Result: 少样本结合思维链提示表现最佳，优于监督基线方法，且LLM在SEC和ECT数据集上的表现存在差异。

Conclusion: LLM可以在不需要大量标注数据的情况下，有效用于金融领域特定目标的立场检测。

Abstract: Financial narratives from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
filing reports and quarterly earnings call transcripts (ECTs) are very
important for investors, auditors, and regulators. However, their length,
financial jargon, and nuanced language make fine-grained analysis difficult.
Prior sentiment analysis in the financial domain required a large, expensive
labeled dataset, making the sentence-level stance towards specific financial
targets challenging. In this work, we introduce a sentence-level corpus for
stance detection focused on three core financial metrics: debt, earnings per
share (EPS), and sales. The sentences were extracted from Form 10-K annual
reports and ECTs, and labeled for stance (positive, negative, neutral) using
the advanced ChatGPT-o3-pro model under rigorous human validation. Using this
corpus, we conduct a systematic evaluation of modern large language models
(LLMs) using zero-shot, few-shot, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting
strategies. Our results show that few-shot with CoT prompting performs best
compared to supervised baselines, and LLMs' performance varies across the SEC
and ECT datasets. Our findings highlight the practical viability of leveraging
LLMs for target-specific stance in the financial domain without requiring
extensive labeled data.

*Tengchao Yang,Sichen Guo,Mengzhao Jia,Jiaming Su,Yuanyang Liu,Zhihan Zhang,Meng Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个AI数学辅导基准MMTutorBench，包含685个围绕关键教学步骤构建的问题，评估12个主流MLLM在三个任务上的表现，发现专有与开源模型存在明显差距，OCR会降低辅导质量，基于量规的LLM-as-a-Judge评估方法可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准大多忽视了数学辅导所需的诊断学生困难和逐步引导的能力，而这是有效数学辅导的关键技能。

Method: 构建MMTutorBench基准，包含685个基于关键教学步骤的问题，每个问题配有特定量规，在六个维度进行细粒度评估，分为洞察发现、操作制定和操作执行三个任务。

Result: 专有与开源MLLM存在明显性能差距，与人类导师相比仍有很大提升空间；OCR流水线会降低辅导质量，少样本提示收益有限；基于量规的LLM-as-a-Judge评估方法高度可靠。

Conclusion: MMTutorBench既展示了AI数学辅导的难度，也证明了其诊断价值，有助于推进AI辅导技术的发展。

Abstract: Effective math tutoring requires not only solving problems but also
diagnosing students' difficulties and guiding them step by step. While
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise, existing benchmarks
largely overlook these tutoring skills. We introduce MMTutorBench, the first
benchmark for AI math tutoring, consisting of 685 problems built around
pedagogically significant key-steps. Each problem is paired with
problem-specific rubrics that enable fine-grained evaluation across six
dimensions, and structured into three tasks-Insight Discovery, Operation
Formulation, and Operation Execution. We evaluate 12 leading MLLMs and find
clear performance gaps between proprietary and open-source systems, substantial
room compared to human tutors, and consistent trends across input variants: OCR
pipelines degrade tutoring quality, few-shot prompting yields limited gains,
and our rubric-based LLM-as-a-Judge proves highly reliable. These results
highlight both the difficulty and diagnostic value of MMTutorBench for
advancing AI tutoring.

*Jiahui Geng,Jonathan Tonglet,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: M4FC是一个新的多模态事实核查数据集，包含4,982张图像和6,980个声明，覆盖10种语言和6个多模态事实核查任务，解决了现有数据集规模小、语言单一、证据泄露等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态自动事实核查数据集存在多个局限性：实例数量少、仅关注一两种语言和任务、存在证据泄露问题、依赖外部新闻文章集来获取真实声明。

Method: 构建M4FC数据集，包含由22个专业事实核查组织验证的4,982张图像和6,980个声明，覆盖10种语言，设计6个多模态事实核查任务，并提供所有任务的基线结果。

Result: 创建了包含4,982张图像和6,980个声明的数据集，每个声明可用10种语言中的一种或两种，涵盖6个多模态事实核查任务，并分析了中间任务组合对下游裁决预测性能的影响。

Conclusion: M4FC数据集解决了现有数据集的局限性，提供了多样化的文化和地理背景，支持多语言多任务的事实核查研究，并公开了数据集和代码。

Abstract: Existing real-world datasets for multimodal automated fact-checking have
multiple limitations: they contain few instances, focus on only one or two
languages and tasks, suffer from evidence leakage, or depend on external sets
of news articles for sourcing true claims. To address these shortcomings, we
introduce M4FC, a new real-world dataset comprising 4,982 images paired with
6,980 claims. The images, verified by professional fact-checkers from 22
organizations, represent diverse cultural and geographic contexts. Each claim
is available in one or two out of ten languages. M4FC spans six multimodal
fact-checking tasks: visual claim extraction, claimant intent prediction, fake
detection, image contextualization, location verification, and verdict
prediction. We provide baseline results for all tasks and analyze how combining
intermediate tasks influence downstream verdict prediction performance. We make
our dataset and code available.

*Jieyong Kim,Maryam Amirizaniani,Soojin Yoon,Dongha Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了IPQA基准，用于评估个性化问答中的核心意图识别能力，发现现有模型在识别用户优先意图方面存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准仅评估回答质量或检索性能，缺乏对意图识别能力的直接评估，而理解用户优先意图对生成满足个性化信息需求的回答至关重要。

Method: 基于满意理论，从用户答案选择行为中推导核心意图，通过系统过滤、LLM标注和严格质量控制构建多领域数据集。

Result: 实验评估显示当前最先进语言模型在个性化情境下难以识别核心意图，随着问题复杂度增加性能下降。

Conclusion: 需要开发更好的核心意图识别方法，IPQA基准和数据集将公开以促进该方向研究。

Abstract: Intent identification serves as the foundation for generating appropriate
responses in personalized question answering (PQA). However, existing
benchmarks evaluate only response quality or retrieval performance without
directly measuring intent identification capabilities. This gap is critical
because without understanding which intents users prioritize, systems cannot
generate responses satisfying individual information needs. To address this, we
introduce the concept of core intents: intents users prioritize when selecting
answers to satisfy their information needs. To evaluate these core intents, we
propose IPQA, a benchmark for core Intent identification in Personalized
Question Answering. Since users do not explicitly state their prioritized
intents, we derive core intents from observable behavior patterns in answer
selection, grounded in satisficing theory where users choose answers meeting
their acceptance thresholds. We construct a dataset with various domains
through systematic filtering, LLM-based annotation, and rigorous quality
control combining automated verification with human validation. Experimental
evaluations across state-of-the-art language models reveal that current systems
struggle with core intent identification in personalized contexts. Models fail
to identify core intents from user histories, with performance degrading as
question complexity increases. The code and dataset will be made publicly
available to facilitate future research in this direction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LIMRANK是一种使用少量合成数据进行微调的LLM重排序器，在推理密集型检索和指令跟随检索任务中表现优异，仅需传统方法5%的训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖大规模微调来适应LLM进行信息重排序任务，计算成本高昂。本文旨在证明现代LLM可以通过最小化、高质量的监督来有效适应。

Method: 设计了LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER管道生成多样化、具有挑战性和真实性的重排序示例，使用这些合成数据微调重排序模型LIMRANK。

Result: LIMRANK在BRIGHT（推理密集型检索）和FollowIR（指令跟随检索）两个基准测试中达到竞争性性能，训练数据量仅为先前工作的不到5%。

Conclusion: LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER管道有效，LIMRANK在下游任务中展现出强大的泛化能力，包括科学文献搜索和知识密集型问题解决的检索增强生成。

Abstract: Existing approaches typically rely on large-scale fine-tuning to adapt LLMs
for information reranking tasks, which is computationally expensive. In this
work, we demonstrate that modern LLMs can be effectively adapted using only
minimal, high-quality supervision. To enable this, we design
LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER, a reusable and open-source pipeline for generating
diverse, challenging, and realistic reranking examples. Using this synthetic
data, we fine-tune our reranker model, LIMRANK. We evaluate LIMRANK on two
challenging benchmarks, i.e., BRIGHT for reasoning-intensive retrieval and
FollowIR for instruction-following retrieval. Our experiments demonstrate that
LIMRANK achieves competitive performance, while being trained on less than 5%
of the data typically used in prior work. Further ablation studies demonstrate
the effectiveness of LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER and the strong generalization
capabilities of LIMRANK across downstream tasks, including scientific
literature search and retrieval-augmented generation for knowledge-intensive
problem solving.

### [113] [Hope Speech Detection in Social Media English Corpora: Performance of Traditional and Transformer Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23585)
*Luis Ramos,Hiram Calvo,Olga Kolesnikova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文评估了传统机器学习模型和微调transformer在希望语音检测任务上的表现，发现transformer模型在精度和召回率方面表现更好，特别是在小数据集上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别希望语音已成为重要的NLP任务，需要检测社交媒体上具有激励性的表达，这些表达体现了能动性和目标导向行为。

Method: 使用传统机器学习模型（线性核SVM、逻辑回归、RBF核SVM、朴素贝叶斯）和微调的transformer模型，在预先分割的希望语音数据集上进行评估。

Result: 传统模型中，线性核SVM和逻辑回归的宏F1为0.78，RBF核SVM为0.77，朴素贝叶斯为0.75。Transformer模型表现更好，最佳模型达到加权精度0.82、加权召回率0.80、加权F1 0.79、宏F1 0.79、准确率0.80。

Conclusion: 虽然优化配置的传统机器学习模型仍然灵活，但transformer架构能够检测希望语音的微妙语义，在小数据集上获得更高的精度和召回率，表明大型transformer和LLM在小型数据集上可能表现更好。

Abstract: The identification of hope speech has become a promised NLP task, considering
the need to detect motivational expressions of agency and goal-directed
behaviour on social media platforms. This proposal evaluates traditional
machine learning models and fine-tuned transformers for a previously split hope
speech dataset as train, development and test set. On development test, a
linear-kernel SVM and logistic regression both reached a macro-F1 of 0.78; SVM
with RBF kernel reached 0.77, and Na\"ive Bayes hit 0.75. Transformer models
delivered better results, the best model achieved weighted precision of 0.82,
weighted recall of 0.80, weighted F1 of 0.79, macro F1 of 0.79, and 0.80
accuracy. These results suggest that while optimally configured traditional
machine learning models remain agile, transformer architectures detect some
subtle semantics of hope to achieve higher precision and recall in hope speech
detection, suggesting that larges transformers and LLMs could perform better in
small datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了BR-RM（分支再思考奖励模型），一种两阶段的奖励建模方法，通过分支选择和条件化再思考来减少判断扩散，提高对细微错误的敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励模型将多个质量维度压缩为单一标量，导致注意力分散和判断扩散问题。受LLM思考两次策略启发，希望将类似原则应用于奖励建模。

Method: 两阶段方法：第一阶段进行自适应分支，选择关键维度并生成证据寻求假设；第二阶段执行分支条件化再思考，针对性重新评估。使用GRPO风格的强化学习训练。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的奖励建模基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，涵盖多个领域。

Conclusion: BR-RM通过将一次性评分转换为聚焦的二次思考推理，有效减少判断扩散，提高对细微但重要错误的敏感性，同时保持实用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on thinking models that
externalize intermediate steps and allocate extra test-time compute, with
think-twice strategies showing that a deliberate second pass can elicit
stronger reasoning. In contrast, most reward models (RMs) still compress many
quality dimensions into a single scalar in one shot, a design that induces
judgment diffusion: attention spreads across evaluation criteria, yielding
diluted focus and shallow analysis. We introduce branch-and-rethink (BR-RM), a
two-turn RM that transfers the think-twice principle to reward modeling. Turn 1
performs adaptive branching, selecting a small set of instance-critical
dimensions (such as factuality and safety) and sketching concise,
evidence-seeking hypotheses. Turn 2 executes branch-conditioned rethinking, a
targeted reread that tests those hypotheses and scrutinizes only what matters
most. We train with GRPO-style reinforcement learning over structured two-turn
traces using a simple binary outcome reward with strict format checks, making
the approach compatible with standard RLHF pipelines. By converting
all-at-oncescoringintofocused, second-lookreasoning,
BR-RMreducesjudgmentdiffusionandimproves sensitivity to subtle yet
consequential errors while remaining practical and scalable. Experimental
results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
three challenging reward modeling benchmarks across diverse domains. The code
and the model will be released soon.

*Alexa R. Tartaglini,Satchel Grant,Daniel Wurgaft,Christopher Potts,Judith E. Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FUGU是一个数据可视化理解任务套件，用于诊断视觉语言模型在图表理解中的错误来源。研究发现模型错误主要源于视觉-语言模块间的信息传递问题，而非视觉编码器本身。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在数据可视化理解任务上表现不佳，但失败原因尚不清楚。研究旨在确定错误来源：是视觉信息编码、视觉-语言模块间信息传递，还是语言模块处理的问题。

Method: 开发FUGU任务套件，使用激活修补和线性探针技术追踪信息流，分析三种广泛使用的视觉语言模型在不同提示策略下的表现。

Result: 模型难以正确生成单个数据点坐标，这些初始错误导致最终响应错误。当提供正确坐标时性能显著提升，但涉及多个数据点的统计关系任务性能反而下降。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型存在架构限制，在可靠的数据可视化理解方面面临重大挑战，特别是视觉-语言模块间的信息传递问题。

Abstract: Data visualizations are vital components of many scientific articles and news
stories. Current vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle on basic data
visualization understanding tasks, but the causes of failure remain unclear.
Are VLM failures attributable to limitations in how visual information in the
data visualization is encoded, how information is transferred between the
vision and language modules, or how information is processed within the
language module? We developed FUGU, a suite of data visualization understanding
tasks, to precisely characterize potential sources of difficulty (e.g.,
extracting the position of data points, distances between them, and other
summary statistics). We used FUGU to investigate three widely used VLMs. To
diagnose the sources of errors produced by these models, we used activation
patching and linear probes to trace information flow through models across a
variety of prompting strategies. We found that some models fail to generate the
coordinates of individual data points correctly, and these initial errors often
lead to erroneous final responses. When these models are provided with the
correct coordinates, performance improves substantially. Moreover, even when
the model generates an incorrect response, the correct coordinates can be
successfully read out from the latent representations in the vision encoder,
suggesting that the source of these errors lies in the vision-language handoff.
We further found that while providing correct coordinates helps with tasks
involving one or a small number of data points, it generally worsens
performance for tasks that require extracting statistical relationships across
many data points. Fine-tuning models on FUGU also fails to yield ceiling
performance. These findings point to architectural constraints in current VLMs
that might pose significant challenges for reliable data visualization
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种成本效益高的自一致性框架，通过语义聚类和余弦相似度共识机制，提高视觉语言模型在农业图像描述中的可靠性，在PlantVillage数据集上取得了优于标准解码方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发展中国家农业病害管理面临专家资源有限、网络连接不可靠和成本限制等挑战，阻碍了大规模AI系统的部署，需要开发更可靠的农业图像描述方法。

Method: 使用轻量级预训练嵌入模型进行语义聚类，通过余弦相似度选择最连贯的标题，并加入人机交互组件让用户确认作物类型以过滤错误生成。

Result: 在800张作物病害图像上测试，单聚类共识方法在10个候选生成时达到83.1%的准确率，优于贪婪解码的77.5%；考虑多个聚类时，前四个候选聚类中的正确响应准确率达到94.0%，优于基线的88.5%。

Conclusion: 该自一致性框架有效提高了农业图像描述的可靠性，为资源受限环境下的农业病害管理提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Agricultural disease management in developing countries such as India, Kenya,
and Nigeria faces significant challenges due to limited access to expert plant
pathologists, unreliable internet connectivity, and cost constraints that
hinder the deployment of large-scale AI systems. This work introduces a
cost-effective self-consistency framework to improve vision-language model
(VLM) reliability for agricultural image captioning. The proposed method
employs semantic clustering, using a lightweight (80MB) pre-trained embedding
model to group multiple candidate responses. It then selects the most coherent
caption -- containing a diagnosis, symptoms, analysis, treatment, and
prevention recommendations -- through a cosine similarity-based consensus. A
practical human-in-the-loop (HITL) component is incorporated, wherein user
confirmation of the crop type filters erroneous generations, ensuring
higher-quality input for the consensus mechanism. Applied to the publicly
available PlantVillage dataset using a fine-tuned 3B-parameter PaliGemma model,
our framework demonstrates improvements over standard decoding methods.
Evaluated on 800 crop disease images with up to 21 generations per image, our
single-cluster consensus method achieves a peak accuracy of 83.1% with 10
candidate generations, compared to the 77.5% baseline accuracy of greedy
decoding. The framework's effectiveness is further demonstrated when
considering multiple clusters; accuracy rises to 94.0% when a correct response
is found within any of the top four candidate clusters, outperforming the 88.5%
achieved by a top-4 selection from the baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代文本到图像扩散模型生成高保真图像，但对输出空间和几何结构的控制有限。

Method: 开发了两个ControlNet模块，利用视觉语言模型进行数据标注，使用专门算法进行条件图像合成。

Result: 实验表明两个模块都提供了有效控制，但在复杂约束下存在局限性。

Conclusion: 两个模型已在HuggingFace发布，为艺术创作提供了更好的空间和几何控制能力。

Abstract: While modern text-to-image diffusion models generate high-fidelity images,
they offer limited control over the spatial and geometric structure of the
output. To address this, we introduce and evaluate two ControlNets specialized
for artistic control: (1) a proportion ControlNet that uses bounding boxes to
dictate the position and scale of objects, and (2) a perspective ControlNet
that employs vanishing lines to control the 3D geometry of the scene. We
support the training of these modules with data pipelines that leverage
vision-language models for annotation and specialized algorithms for
conditioning image synthesis. Our experiments demonstrate that both modules
provide effective control but exhibit limitations with complex constraints.
Both models are released on HuggingFace:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: H2OFlow是一个无需人工标注的3D人-物交互(HOI)感知框架，通过合成数据和密集扩散过程学习接触、朝向和空间占用等多维交互特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖人工标注数据集且局限于接触分析，忽略了朝向偏好和空间占用等关键交互维度，需要更全面且高效的3D交互感知方案。

Method: 使用3D生成模型合成数据，通过点云上的密集扩散过程学习基于3D流的表示，全面建模接触、朝向和空间占用等交互特征。

Result: H2OFlow在真实物体上表现出良好的泛化能力，在3D交互感知方面超越了依赖人工标注或网格表示的方法。

Conclusion: 该框架证明了仅使用合成数据就能有效学习全面的3D交互特征，为计算机视觉和机器人学提供了更高效的交互理解方案。

Abstract: Understanding how humans interact with the surrounding environment, and
specifically reasoning about object interactions and affordances, is a critical
challenge in computer vision, robotics, and AI. Current approaches often depend
on labor-intensive, hand-labeled datasets capturing real-world or simulated
human-object interaction (HOI) tasks, which are costly and time-consuming to
produce. Furthermore, most existing methods for 3D affordance understanding are
limited to contact-based analysis, neglecting other essential aspects of
human-object interactions, such as orientation (\eg, humans might have a
preferential orientation with respect certain objects, such as a TV) and
spatial occupancy (\eg, humans are more likely to occupy certain regions around
an object, like the front of a microwave rather than its back). To address
these limitations, we introduce \emph{H2OFlow}, a novel framework that
comprehensively learns 3D HOI affordances -- encompassing contact, orientation,
and spatial occupancy -- using only synthetic data generated from 3D generative
models. H2OFlow employs a dense 3D-flow-based representation, learned through a
dense diffusion process operating on point clouds. This learned flow enables
the discovery of rich 3D affordances without the need for human annotations.
Through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that
H2OFlow generalizes effectively to real-world objects and surpasses prior
methods that rely on manual annotations or mesh-based representations in
modeling 3D affordance.

TL;DR: Face-MakeUpV2是一个面部图像生成模型，通过构建大规模数据集、引入3D面部渲染通道和全局面部特征通道，解决了文本到图像模型中的面部属性泄漏和物理一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像模型在响应局部语义指令时存在面部属性泄漏和物理一致性不足的问题，需要开发能够保持面部ID和物理特征一致性的生成模型。

Method: 1. 构建包含约100万图像-文本-掩码对的大规模数据集FaceCaptionMask-1M；2. 使用通用文本到图像预训练模型作为主干，引入3D面部渲染通道和全局面部特征通道；3. 设计语义对齐和感知损失两个优化目标。

Result: 广泛实验表明，Face-MakeUpV2在保持面部ID和参考图像物理一致性方面实现了最佳整体性能。

Conclusion: Face-MakeUpV2在可靠和可控的面部编辑应用中具有实际潜力。

Abstract: In facial image generation, current text-to-image models often suffer from
facial attribute leakage and insufficient physical consistency when responding
to local semantic instructions. In this study, we propose Face-MakeUpV2, a
facial image generation model that aims to maintain the consistency of face ID
and physical characteristics with the reference image. First, we constructed a
large-scale dataset FaceCaptionMask-1M comprising approximately one million
image-text-masks pairs that provide precise spatial supervision for the local
semantic instructions. Second, we employed a general text-to-image pretrained
model as the backbone and introduced two complementary facial information
injection channels: a 3D facial rendering channel to incorporate the physical
characteristics of the image and a global facial feature channel. Third, we
formulated two optimization objectives for the supervised learning of our
model: semantic alignment in the model's embedding space to mitigate the
attribute leakage problem and perceptual loss on facial images to preserve ID
consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our Face-MakeUpV2 achieves
best overall performance in terms of preserving face ID and maintaining
physical consistency of the reference images. These results highlight the
practical potential of Face-MakeUpV2 for reliable and controllable facial
editing in diverse applications.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了紧凑二进制人脸模板的长期稳定性，量化了年龄漂移率（每十年比特数），发现64位和128位模板的漂移率分别为1.357和2.571比特/十年，表明随着时间推移类内距离会系统性增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究紧凑二进制人脸模板在长期使用中的稳定性，特别是在智能卡和卡上匹配部署场景下，了解年龄变化对模板匹配性能的影响。

Method: 使用现代人脸CNN提取浮点嵌入，通过PCA-ITQ压缩为64位和128位二进制码，在AgeDB数据集上对每个身份构建所有真实配对，拟合汉明距离与绝对年龄差的线性模型。

Result: 在566个身份上的中位数斜率：64位模板为1.357比特/十年，128位模板为2.571比特/十年，分布主要为正，表明类内距离随时间系统性增加。漂移率与码长成正比，较短代码在固定决策阈值下更稳定。

Conclusion: 二进制人脸模板存在可量化的年龄漂移，较短代码更稳定。提出了定期重新注册和针对不稳定比特位置进行目标奇偶校验等简单缓解措施，为智能卡部署提供了重要参考。

Abstract: We study the longitudinal stability of compact binary face templates and
quantify ageing drift directly in bits per decade. Float embeddings from a
modern face CNN are compressed with PCA-ITQ into 64- and 128-bit codes. For
each identity in AgeDB with at least three distinct ages, we form all genuine
pairs and fit a per-identity linear model of Hamming distance versus absolute
age gap. Across 566 identities, the median slope is 1.357 bits per decade for
64-bit templates and 2.571 bits per decade for 128-bit templates, with tight
non-parametric 95 percent bootstrap confidence intervals. The distributions are
predominantly positive, indicating a small but systematic increase in
intra-class distance over time. Because drift scales with code length, shorter
codes are inherently more age-stable at a fixed decision threshold. We connect
these slopes to operating characteristics by reporting EER and TPR at FAR = 1
percent in three age bins. We discuss implications for smart-card and
match-on-card deployments, including simple mitigations such as periodic
re-enrolment and targeted parity on empirically unstable bit positions. Code
and CSV artifacts are provided to support reproducibility.

Abstract: In this study, we present an interpretable deep learning framework for the
early detection of breast cancer using quantitative features extracted from
digitized fine needle aspirate (FNA) images of breast masses. Our deep neural
network, using ReLU activations, the Adam optimizer, and a binary cross-entropy
loss, delivers state-of-the-art classification performance, achieving an
accuracy of 0.992, precision of 1.000, recall of 0.977, and an F1 score of
0.988. These results substantially exceed the benchmarks reported in the
literature. We evaluated the model under identical protocols against a suite of
well-established algorithms (logistic regression, decision trees, random
forests, stochastic gradient descent, K-nearest neighbors, and XGBoost) and
found the deep model consistently superior on the same metrics. Recognizing
that high predictive accuracy alone is insufficient for clinical adoption due
to the black-box nature of deep learning models, we incorporated model-agnostic
Explainable AI techniques such as SHAP and LIME to produce feature-level
attributions and human-readable visualizations. These explanations quantify the
contribution of each feature to individual predictions, support error analysis,
and increase clinician trust, thus bridging the gap between performance and
interpretability for real-world clinical use. The concave points feature of the
cell nuclei is found to be the most influential feature positively impacting
the classification task. This insight can be very helpful in improving the
diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer by highlighting the key
characteristics of breast tumor.

*Runchu Donga,Peng Zhao,Guiqin Wang,Nan Qi,Jie Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EdgeSync是一种高效的边缘模型更新方法，通过改进样本过滤和动态训练管理，解决实时视频分析中模型精度下降和更新延迟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时视频分析系统在边缘设备部署轻量模型以减少延迟，但数据特征随时间变化（如光照、天气条件）会导致模型精度下降。现有方法面临重训练计算密集和模型与当前数据分布不匹配的挑战。

Method: EdgeSync通过结合时效性和推理结果来增强样本过滤，确保训练样本与当前视频内容更相关；同时采用动态训练管理模块优化模型更新的时间和顺序。

Result: 在多样复杂的真实世界数据集上的评估表明，EdgeSync相比现有方法精度提升约3.4%，相比传统方法提升约10%。

Conclusion: EdgeSync通过高效的样本过滤和动态训练管理，有效解决了边缘模型更新中的延迟和精度问题，显著提升了实时视频分析系统的性能。

Abstract: Real-time video analytics systems typically deploy lightweight models on edge
devices to reduce latency. However, the distribution of data features may
change over time due to various factors such as changing lighting and weather
conditions, leading to decreased model accuracy. Recent frameworks try to
address this issue by leveraging remote servers to continuously train and adapt
lightweight edge models using more complex models in the cloud. Despite these
advancements, existing methods face two key challenges: first, the retraining
process is compute-intensive, causing significant delays in model updates;
second, the new model may not align well with the evolving data distribution of
the current video stream. To address these challenges, we introduce EdgeSync,
an efficient edge-model updating approach that enhances sample filtering by
incorporating timeliness and inference results, thus ensuring training samples
are more relevant to the current video content while reducing update delays.
Additionally, EdgeSync features a dynamic training management module that
optimizes the timing and sequencing of model updates to improve their
timeliness. Evaluations on diverse and complex real-world datasets demonstrate
that EdgeSync improves accuracy by approximately 3.4% compared to existing
methods and by about 10% compared to traditional approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文首次全面评估SAM2变体在火焰分割任务中的表现，发现边界框提示策略优于自动和单点方法，其中Box+MP组合在Khan数据集上获得最高性能（mIoU 0.64，Dice 0.75），轻量级变体更适合边缘部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 火焰分割面临火焰边界不规则、边缘半透明和强度变化大的挑战，而SAM模型在火焰分割特别是移动部署约束下的有效性尚未充分探索。

Method: 系统评估四种SAM2.1变体和两种移动导向变体，使用多种提示策略：自动、单正点、单正点+单负点、多正点、边界框及其混合变体。

Result: 边界框提示策略表现最佳，Box+MP在Khan数据集上达到最高mIoU 0.64和Dice 0.75，轻量级变体显著降低内存和计算成本。

Conclusion: 为火焰监测系统中部署可提示分割模型提供了关键见解，并为领域特定SAM应用建立了基准。

Abstract: Fire segmentation remains a critical challenge in computer vision due to
flames' irregular boundaries, translucent edges, and highly variable
intensities. While the Segment Anything Models (SAM and SAM2) have demonstrated
impressive cross-domain generalization capabilities, their effectiveness in
fire segmentation -- particularly under mobile deployment constraints --
remains largely unexplored. This paper presents the first comprehensive
evaluation of SAM2 variants for fire segmentation, focusing on bounding box
prompting strategies to enhance deployment feasibility. We systematically
evaluate four SAM2.1 variants (tiny, small, base_plus, large) alongside
mobile-oriented variants (TinySAM, MobileSAM) across three fire datasets using
multiple prompting strategies: automatic, single positive point (SP), single
positive point + single negative point (SP+SN), multiple positive points (MP),
bounding box (Box), and hybrid variants (Box+SP and Box+MP). Our experimental
results demonstrate that bounding box prompts consistently outperform automatic
and single point-based approaches, with Box+MP achieving the highest mean IoU
(0.64) and Dice coefficient (0.75) on the Khan dataset. Lightweight variants
such as TinySAM and MobileSAM further reduce memory and computational costs,
making them more suitable for latency-tolerant edge scenarios. Overall, this
work provides critical insights for deploying promptable segmentation models in
fire monitoring systems and establishes benchmarks for future research in
domain-specific SAM applications. Code is available at:

*Guo Li,Yuyang Yu,Xuemiao Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种针对扩散模型的高效成员推理攻击方法，通过注入轻微噪声并分析噪声分布的聚合程度来判断样本是否属于训练集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion）的广泛使用带来了隐私风险，特别是成员推理攻击，即判断特定数据样本是否用于模型训练过程。

Method: 基于轻微噪声注入和噪声分布聚合度评估。核心直觉是：训练集样本和非训练集样本在扩散模型的噪声预测模式上存在可区分差异——成员图像在扩散过程特定时间步的预测噪声呈现更高聚合性。

Result: 该方法相比现有方法需要更少访问目标扩散模型，在多个数据集上表现优异，面对大规模文本到图像扩散模型时在ASR和AUC指标上显示出更好的攻击效果。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了扩散模型存在成员推理攻击漏洞，且提出的噪声聚合分析方法具有可扩展性和高效性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated powerful performance in generating
high-quality images. A typical example is text-to-image generator like Stable
Diffusion. However, their widespread use also poses potential privacy risks. A
key concern is membership inference attacks, which attempt to determine whether
a particular data sample was used in the model training process. We propose an
efficient membership inference attack method against diffusion models. This
method is based on the injection of slight noise and the evaluation of the
aggregation degree of the noise distribution. The intuition is that the noise
prediction patterns of diffusion models for training set samples and
non-training set samples exhibit distinguishable differences.Specifically, we
suppose that member images exhibit higher aggregation of predicted noise around
a certain time step of the diffusion process. In contrast, the predicted noises
of non-member images exhibit a more discrete characteristic around the certain
time step. Compared with other existing methods, our proposed method requires
fewer visits to the target diffusion model. We inject slight noise into the
image under test and then determine its membership by analyzing the aggregation
degree of the noise distribution predicted by the model. Empirical findings
indicate that our method achieves superior performance across multiple
datasets. At the same time, our method can also show better attack effects in
ASR and AUC when facing large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, proving the
scalability of our method.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可微分渲染器的相机位姿估计协方差下界闭式解，通过将渲染器视为测量函数，在流形上线性化图像形成过程，得到渲染感知的Cramér-Rao下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 位姿估计在计算机视觉和机器人领域至关重要，但现有工作很少为密集或学习模型下的位姿提供严格的不确定性量化。

Method: 将可微分渲染器作为测量函数，在流形上对小的位姿扰动进行图像形成过程的线性化，推导出渲染感知的Cramér-Rao下界。

Result: 该方法可简化为经典的捆绑调整不确定性，确保与视觉理论的连续性，并能自然地扩展到多智能体设置，通过融合多个相机的Fisher信息。

Conclusion: 该统计公式在下游任务中具有应用价值，如协作感知和无需显式关键点对应关系的新视角合成。

Abstract: Pose estimation is essential for many applications within computer vision and
robotics. Despite its uses, few works provide rigorous uncertainty
quantification for poses under dense or learned models. We derive a closed-form
lower bound on the covariance of camera pose estimates by treating a
differentiable renderer as a measurement function. Linearizing image formation
with respect to a small pose perturbation on the manifold yields a render-aware
Cram\'er-Rao bound. Our approach reduces to classical bundle-adjustment
uncertainty, ensuring continuity with vision theory. It also naturally extends
to multi-agent settings by fusing Fisher information across cameras. Our
statistical formulation has downstream applications for tasks such as
cooperative perception and novel view synthesis without requiring explicit
keypoint correspondences.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了AVEP（以动作为中心的视频事件预测）任务，构建了包含35K标注视频和178K视频片段的大规模结构化数据集，并开发了基于节点-图层次注意力的EventFormer模型，在复杂逻辑和语义信息的事件预测方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类事件多以视频形式记录而非脚本，但在视觉领域缺乏相关研究。现有视频预测任务缺乏复杂逻辑和丰富语义信息，需要开发专门的事件预测任务。

Method: 提出了EventFormer模型，采用节点-图层次注意力机制，能够捕捉事件与其参数之间的关系以及参数间的共指关系。构建了包含细粒度多模态事件参数节点标注的大规模结构化数据集。

Result: 在AVEP任务上，EventFormer模型优于多个SOTA视频预测模型和LVLMs，证明了任务的复杂性和数据集的价值。

Conclusion: AVEP任务和EventFormer模型为视频事件预测提供了新的研究方向，大规模结构化数据集支持了复杂事件逻辑的研究，模型在捕捉事件结构和语义关系方面表现出色。

Abstract: Script event induction, which aims to predict the subsequent event based on
the context, is a challenging task in NLP, achieving remarkable success in
practical applications. However, human events are mostly recorded and presented
in the form of videos rather than scripts, yet there is a lack of related
research in the realm of vision. To address this problem, we introduce AVEP
(Action-centric Video Event Prediction), a task that distinguishes itself from
existing video prediction tasks through its incorporation of more complex logic
and richer semantic information. We present a large structured dataset, which
consists of about $35K$ annotated videos and more than $178K$ video clips of
event, built upon existing video event datasets to support this task. The
dataset offers more fine-grained annotations, where the atomic unit is
represented as a multimodal event argument node, providing better structured
representations of video events. Due to the complexity of event structures,
traditional visual models that take patches or frames as input are not
well-suited for AVEP. We propose EventFormer, a node-graph hierarchical
attention based video event prediction model, which can capture both the
relationships between events and their arguments and the coreferencial
relationships between arguments. We conducted experiments using several SOTA
video prediction models as well as LVLMs on AVEP, demonstrating both the
complexity of the task and the value of the dataset. Our approach outperforms
all these video prediction models. We will release the dataset and code for
replicating the experiments and annotations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模光纤成像需要测量值与测量矩阵严格匹配才能重建图像，但实际应用中由于系统配置未知或光纤弯曲后难以实时对准，导致测量矩阵无法获取，传统重建算法失效。

Method: 提出失配方程，设计匹配和校准求解算法来构建新的测量矩阵，并在附录中提供了方程和算法的详细证明。

Result: 实验结果表明，在低噪声水平下，构建的矩阵可用于传统重建算法的匹配对，成功重建原始图像。算法对噪声、计算精度和正交性具有一定鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该理论解决了测量矩阵未知时的图像重建问题，分析了噪声等因素的影响，讨论了理论的局限性和潜在应用。

Abstract: Multimode fiber imaging requires strict matching between measurement value
and measurement matrix to achieve image reconstruction. However, in practical
applications, the measurement matrix often cannot be obtained due to unknown
system configuration or difficulty in real-time alignment after arbitrary fiber
bending, resulting in the failure of traditional reconstruction algorithms.
This paper presents a novel mismatch reconstruction theory for solving the
problem of image reconstruction when measurement matrix is unknown. We first
propose mismatch equation and design matched and calibration solution
algorithms to construct a new measurement matrix. In addition, we also provide
a detailed proof of these equations and algorithms in the appendix. The
experimental results show that under low noise levels, constructed matrix can
be used for matched pair in traditional reconstruction algorithms, and
reconstruct the original image successfully. Then, we analyze the impact of
noise, computational precision and orthogonality on reconstruction performance.
The results show that proposed algorithms have a certain degree of robustness.
Finally, we discuss the limitations and potential applications of this theory.

Abstract: Data fusion is an essential task in various domains, enabling the integration
of multi-source information to enhance data quality and insights. One key
application is in satellite remote sensing, where fusing multi-sensor
observations can improve spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, we
explore the design space of diffusion and flow models for data fusion, focusing
on the integration of Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational
Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite

image-to-image generative models, including UNET, diffusion, and flow modeling
architectures. We evaluate the effectiveness of these architectures in
satellite remote sensing data fusion, identifying diffusion models based on
UNet as particularly adept at preserving fine-grained spatial details and
generating high-fidelity fused images. We also provide guidance on the
selection of noise schedulers in diffusion-based models, highlighting the
trade-offs between iterative solvers for faster inference and discrete
schedulers for higher-quality reconstructions. Additionally, we explore
quantization techniques to optimize memory efficiency and computational cost
without compromising performance. Our findings offer practical insights into
selecting the most effective diffusion and flow model architectures for data
fusion tasks, particularly in remote sensing applications, and provide
recommendations for leveraging noise scheduling strategies to enhance fusion
quality.

Conclusion: MAFR为融合视觉和几何信息提供了原则性方法，提升了工业异常检测的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) increasingly benefits from integrating 2D
and 3D data, but robust cross-modal fusion remains challenging. We propose a
novel unsupervised framework, Multi-Modal Attention-Driven Fusion Restoration
(MAFR), which synthesises a unified latent space from RGB images and point
clouds using a shared fusion encoder, followed by attention-guided,
modality-specific decoders. Anomalies are localised by measuring reconstruction
errors between input features and their restored counterparts. Evaluations on
the MVTec 3D-AD and Eyecandies benchmarks demonstrate that MAFR achieves
state-of-the-art results, with a mean I-AUROC of 0.972 and 0.901, respectively.
The framework also exhibits strong performance in few-shot learning settings,
and ablation studies confirm the critical roles of the fusion architecture and
composite loss. MAFR offers a principled approach for fusing visual and
geometric information, advancing the robustness and accuracy of industrial
anomaly detection. Code is available at https://github.com/adabrh/MAFR

TL;DR: TITA是一个轻量级框架，通过冻结基础视觉语言模型并训练奖励模型来提供词元级推理时对齐，显著减少幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型的输出容易出现与视觉输入不符的幻觉文本，而现有的对齐方法要么依赖昂贵的微调，要么只能提供粗粒度的反馈。

Method: 冻结基础VLM，训练奖励模型来近似其分布，在推理时提取隐式偏好信号作为奖励模型和目标VLM之间的对数概率比，提供密集的自回归反馈。

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得一致提升，MMVet提升8.6%，POPE提升6.7%，幻觉显著减少，VQA准确率提高，且推理开销可忽略。

Conclusion: TITA作为推理时的DPO变体，能够在不重新训练主干网络的情况下提供词元级纠正信号，有效减少幻觉并提升模型性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become essential backbones of modern
multimodal intelligence, yet their outputs remain prone to
hallucination-plausible text misaligned with visual inputs. Existing alignment
approaches often rely on expensive fine-tuning with annotated preference data
or sequence-level inference strategies that provide only coarse, delayed
feedback. To overcome these limitations, we present TITA (Token-level
Inference-Time Alignment), a lightweight framework that freezes the base VLM
and instead trains a reward model to approximate its distribution. During
inference, implicit preference signals are extracted as log-probability ratios
between the reward model and the target VLM, yielding dense autoregressive
feedback. This formulation can be viewed as an inference-time variant of Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), providing token-level corrective signals without
retraining the backbone. Extensive evaluations on LLaVA-1.5-7B and 13B show
consistent gains across 12 benchmarks, with improvements of 8.6% on MMVet and
6.7% on POPE, indicating stronger general understanding and reduced
hallucinations. Additional experiments on Qwen2.5-VL-7B and DeepSeek-VL2-27.5B
show comparable gains, especially in hallucination reduction and VQA accuracy,
while incurring negligible inference overhead.

Conclusion: HIBA架构具有卓越的泛化能力和架构优势，能够在整个参数范围内实现一致的性能卓越表现

Abstract: The rapid advancement of time series foundation models (TSFMs) has been
propelled by migrating architectures from language models. While existing TSFMs
demonstrate impressive performance, their direct adoption of cross-domain
architectures constrains effective capture of multiscale temporal dependencies
inherent to time series data. This limitation becomes particularly pronounced
during zero-shot transfer across datasets with divergent underlying patterns
and sampling strategies. To address these challenges, we propose Hierarchical
Interleaved Block Attention (HIBA) which employs hierarchical inter- and
intra-block sparse attention to effectively capture multi-scale dependencies.
Intra-block attention facilitates local information exchange, and inter-block
attention operates across blocks to capture global temporal pattern interaction
and dynamic evolution. Leveraging the HIBA architecture, we introduce Xihe, a
scalable TSFM family spanning from an ultra-efficient 9.5M parameter
configuration to high-capacity 1.5B variant. Evaluated on the comprehensive
GIFT-Eval benchmark, our most compact Xihe-tiny model (9.5M) surpasses the
majority of contemporary TSFMs, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency.
More impressively, Xihe-max (1.5B) establishes new state-of-the-art zero-shot
performance, surpassing previous best results by a substantial margin. This
consistent performance excellence across the entire parameter spectrum provides
compelling evidence for the exceptional generalization capabilities and
architectural superiority of HIBA.

Abstract: We explore the enhancement of Human-in-the-Loop video annotation by
integrating automatic capabilities to ease the task for annotators and assess
their performance. The research delves into the practical implications of the
annotation processes, the integration of AI components, and the evaluation of
its outcomes. We analyze their impact on efficiency, accuracy, and overall
annotation quality. Focusing on the Human-in-the-Loop for video annotation
tasks, we implemented a single-iteration scheme using Label Studio and
AI-powered zero-shot pre-annotations. Using this framework, we designed a test
based on the annotation of the UCF-Crime dataset to discriminate between normal
and abnormal activities in video footage. Our results evidence how automatic
AI-based pre-annotation can streamline the video annotation workflow,
empowering human annotators and optimizing the overall pipeline. Using the
pre-annotated data, we observed a 35% reduction in the annotation time for 70%
of the annotators with similar quality annotations, compared to the traditional
manual annotation task. Results are consistent with asset duration and
complexity. We also observed that while annotators rapidly learned to use the
tool, the produced annotations are more coherent among annotators and better
match the natural clustering of the video frames.

Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) diagnosis from radiographs remains challenging due
to the subtle morphological details that standard deep learning models struggle
to capture effectively. We propose a novel multimodal framework that combines
anatomical structure with radiographic features by integrating a morphological
graph representation - derived from Segment Anything Model (SAM) segmentations
- with a vision encoder. Our approach enforces alignment between
geometry-informed graph embeddings and radiographic features through mutual
information maximization, significantly improving KOA classification accuracy.
By constructing graphs from anatomical features, we introduce explicit
morphological priors that mirror clinical assessment criteria, enriching the
feature space and enhancing the model's inductive bias. Experiments on the
Osteoarthritis Initiative dataset demonstrate that our approach surpasses
single-modality baselines by up to 10\% in accuracy (reaching nearly 80\%),
while outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods by 8\% in accuracy and
11\% in F1 score. These results underscore the critical importance of
incorporating anatomical structure into radiographic analysis for accurate KOA
severity grading.

i.e., of evaluations of a diffusion model. We show that two parallel processors
or samplers under such limitation can improve the quality of the sampled image.
Particularly, the two samplers make denoising steps at successive times, and
their information is appropriately integrated in the latent image. Remarkably,
our method is simple both conceptually and to implement: it is plug-&-play,
model agnostic, and does not require any additional fine-tuning or external
models. We test our method with both automated and human evaluations for
different diffusion models. We also show that a naive integration of the
information from the two samplers lowers sample quality. Finally, we find that
adding more parallel samplers does not necessarily improve sample quality.

*Jiaao Yu,Mingjie Han,Tao Gong,Jian Zhang,Man Lan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FDA-CLIP是一种基于CLIP的文本-视频检索框架，通过帧差生成动态区域掩码，引导模型关注关键动态语义区域，抑制静态背景冗余。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文本-视频检索方法依赖大规模标注数据、存在模态鸿沟的问题，以及现有CLIP适配方法缺乏动态特征增强和静态冗余特征抑制能力。

Method: 使用帧差生成动态区域掩码，作为Alpha通道输入Alpha-CLIP，主动引导模型关注语义关键动态区域。

Result: 实验证明帧差引导的视频语义编码能有效平衡检索效率和准确性。

Conclusion: FDA-CLIP通过动态区域关注机制，在文本-视频检索任务中实现了更好的跨模态对齐效果。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of video data, text-video retrieval technology has
become increasingly important in numerous application scenarios such as
recommendation and search. Early text-video retrieval methods suffer from two
critical drawbacks: first, they heavily rely on large-scale annotated
video-text pairs, leading to high data acquisition costs; second, there is a
significant modal gap between video and text features, which limits cross-modal
alignment accuracy. With the development of vision-language model, adapting
CLIP to video tasks has attracted great attention. However, existing adaptation
methods generally lack enhancement for dynamic video features and fail to
effectively suppress static redundant features. To address this issue, this
paper proposes FDA-CLIP (Frame Difference Alpha-CLIP), which is a concise
CLIP-based training framework for text-video alignment. Specifically, the
method uses frame differences to generate dynamic region masks, which are input
into Alpha-CLIP as an additional Alpha channel. This proactively guides the
model to focus on semantically critical dynamic regions while suppressing
static background redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that frame
difference-guided video semantic encoding can effectively balance retrieval
efficiency and accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的微调任务MPCC，通过重构被遮挡图像中的语义内容来整合视觉上下文和常识推理，并开发了RFPS训练方法来提升模型在OOD和跨任务场景中的泛化推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理模型主要关注单模态语言设置，在多模态场景特别是视觉语言任务中存在适应不足的问题，无法充分利用视觉上下文和常识知识，限制了跨多模态环境的推理能力泛化。

Method: 引入掩码预测任务MPCC，开发专门的评估基准MPCC Eval，并提出强化微调与先验采样方法RFPS来指导推理。

Result: MPCC任务和RFPS方法有效提升了模型性能，增强了在分布外和跨任务场景中的泛化推理能力。

Conclusion: 通过整合视觉上下文和常识推理的微调方法，能够显著提升多模态模型的泛化推理能力，为通用推理奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in reasoning models have markedly advanced the reasoning
capabilities of large language models, particularly via training on tasks with
verifiable rewards. Yet, a significant gap persists in their adaptation to real
world multimodal scenarios, most notably, vision language tasks, due to a heavy
focus on single modal language settings. While efforts to transplant
reinforcement learning techniques from NLP to VLMs have emerged, these
approaches often remain confined to perception centric tasks or reduce images
to textual summaries, failing to fully exploit visual context and commonsense
knowledge, ultimately constraining the generalization of reasoning capabilities
across diverse multimodal environments. To address this limitation, we
introduce a novel fine tuning task, Masked Prediction via Context and
Commonsense, which forces models to integrate visual context and commonsense
reasoning by reconstructing semantically meaningful content from occluded
images, thereby laying the foundation for generalized reasoning. To
systematically evaluate the model performance in generalized reasoning, we
developed a specialized evaluation benchmark, MPCC Eval, and employed various
fine tuning strategies to guide reasoning. Among these, we introduced an
innovative training method, Reinforcement Fine tuning with Prior Sampling,
which not only enhances model performance but also improves its generalized
reasoning capabilities in OOD and cross task scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了SRE-CLIP适配器框架，通过语义关系结构损失和跨模态对齐保持策略，解决了CLIP在领域自适应零样本学习中的两个核心挑战，在I2AwA和I2WebV基准上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据标注成本高昂，现有方法无法平衡跨领域迁移和跨类别泛化，需要领域自适应零样本学习(DAZSL)。虽然视觉语言模型(如CLIP)在DAZSL领域具有固有优势，但当前研究未能充分利用其潜力。

Method: 提出语义关系增强的CLIP(SRE-CLIP)适配器框架，包含语义关系结构损失和跨模态对齐保持策略，以解决跨类别知识转移效率低和跨模态对齐在目标域微调中退化的问题。

Result: 作为首个基于CLIP的DAZSL方法，SRE-CLIP在I2AwA和I2WebV基准上实现了最先进的性能，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SRE-CLIP框架有效解决了CLIP在DAZSL应用中的核心挑战，为数据受限场景下的深度学习模型训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The high cost of data annotation has spurred research on training deep
learning models in data-limited scenarios. Existing paradigms, however, fail to
balance cross-domain transfer and cross-category generalization, giving rise to
the demand for Domain-Adaptive Zero-Shot Learning (DAZSL). Although
vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have inherent advantages in the DAZSL
field, current studies do not fully exploit their potential. Applying CLIP to
DAZSL faces two core challenges: inefficient cross-category knowledge transfer
due to the lack of semantic relation guidance, and degraded cross-modal
alignment during target domain fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose
a Semantic Relation-Enhanced CLIP (SRE-CLIP) Adapter framework, integrating a
Semantic Relation Structure Loss and a Cross-Modal Alignment Retention
Strategy. As the first CLIP-based DAZSL method, SRE-CLIP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the I2AwA and I2WebV benchmarks, significantly
outperforming existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人导航系统决策过程不透明的问题，在保持高性能的同时实现可解释性，克服可解释系统性能不足的权衡问题。

Method: 将动作语言描述作为强化学习导航的辅助任务，利用预训练视觉语言模型进行知识蒸馏，解决缺乏真实标注数据的问题。

Result: 在各种导航任务中实现高性能导航的同时能够描述动作，在语义音频-视觉导航任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将可解释性融入导航系统，在性能与可解释性之间取得良好平衡，为可靠机器人系统提供新思路。

Abstract: The field of multimodal robot navigation in indoor environments has garnered
significant attention in recent years. However, as tasks and methods become
more advanced, the action decision systems tend to become more complex and
operate as black-boxes. For a reliable system, the ability to explain or
describe its decisions is crucial; however, there tends to be a trade-off in
that explainable systems can not outperform non-explainable systems in terms of
performance. In this paper, we propose incorporating the task of describing
actions in language into the reinforcement learning of navigation as an
auxiliary task. Existing studies have found it difficult to incorporate
describing actions into reinforcement learning due to the absence of
ground-truth data. We address this issue by leveraging knowledge distillation
from pre-trained description generation models, such as vision-language models.
We comprehensively evaluate our approach across various navigation tasks,
demonstrating that it can describe actions while attaining high navigation
performance. Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art performance in the
particularly challenging multimodal navigation task of semantic audio-visual
navigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病视网膜病变是糖尿病的主要并发症，早期无症状但会导致不可逆视力丧失。印度等地区糖尿病人口众多，需要可扩展的准确筛查方法。

Method: 采用混合诊断框架，结合手工特征提取（捕捉关键临床标志物）和深度学习（自动化分层模式识别），融合可解释临床数据与学习特征。

Result: 该混合方法在分类性能上超越了单独的深度学习方法，表现出更优的分类能力和更低的假阴性率。

Conclusion: 这种多模态AI驱动方法能够实现可扩展、准确的糖尿病视网膜病变筛查，特别适用于糖尿病负担重的地区。

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a vision-threatening complication of Dia-betes
Mellitus (DM), is a major global concern, particularly in India, which has one
of the highest diabetic populations. Prolonged hyperglycemia damages reti-nal
microvasculature, leading to DR symptoms like microaneurysms, hemor-rhages, and
fluid leakage, which, if undetected, cause irreversible vision loss. Therefore,
early screening is crucial as DR is asymptomatic in its initial stages. Fundus
imaging aids precise diagnosis by detecting subtle retinal lesions. This paper
introduces a hybrid diagnostic framework combining traditional feature
extraction and deep learning (DL) to enhance DR detection. While handcrafted
features capture key clinical markers, DL automates hierarchical pattern
recog-nition, improving early diagnosis. The model synergizes interpretable
clinical data with learned features, surpassing standalone DL approaches that
demon-strate superior classification and reduce false negatives. This
multimodal AI-driven approach enables scalable, accurate DR screening, crucial
for diabetes-burdened regions.

Conclusion: YOLOv11凭借其增强的特征提取能力和单次前向传播处理整个图像的优势，成为NEU数据集上表面缺陷检测最有效的模型。

Abstract: This article compares the performance of six prominent object detection
algorithms, YOLOv11, RetinaNet, Fast R-CNN, YOLOv8, RT-DETR, and DETR, on the
NEU-DET surface defect detection dataset, comprising images representing
various metal surface defects, a crucial application in industrial quality
control. Each model's performance was assessed regarding detection accuracy,
speed, and robustness across different defect types such as scratches,
inclusions, and rolled-in scales. YOLOv11, a state-of-the-art real-time object
detection algorithm, demonstrated superior performance compared to the other
methods, achieving a remarkable 70% higher accuracy on average. This
improvement can be attributed to YOLOv11s enhanced feature extraction
capabilities and ability to process the entire image in a single forward pass,
making it faster and more efficient in detecting minor surface defects.
Additionally, YOLOv11's architecture optimizations, such as improved anchor box
generation and deeper convolutional layers, contributed to more precise
localization of defects. In conclusion, YOLOv11's outstanding performance in
accuracy and speed solidifies its position as the most effective model for
surface defect detection on the NEU dataset, surpassing competing algorithms by
a substantial margin.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SITS-DECO是一个基于GPT风格解码器架构的生成式地球观测基础模型，通过统一序列框架处理多模态、多任务EO数据，无需特定任务或模态的适配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EO基础模型需要额外适配，且结构僵化围绕特定数据源或训练方法。受大语言模型启发，希望通过统一序列框架简化EO数据使用。

Method: 使用简单的GPT风格解码器架构，通过符号提示在单一统一架构中执行多个监督和自监督任务，无需任务或模态特定适配。

Result: 尽管模型简单且缺乏空间上下文，但在作物类型分类任务(PASTIS-R)上优于更大的EO基础模型，证明密集时间序列建模是当前范式的关键缺失要素。

Conclusion: SITS-DECO展示了数据为中心建模范式的可行性，能力源于训练数据的多样性和结构而非架构复杂性，为未来生成式EO基础模型提供了概念桥梁。

Abstract: Earth Observation (EO) Foundation Modelling (FM) holds great promise for
simplifying and improving the use of EO data for diverse real-world tasks.
However, most existing models require additional adaptation before they can be
used and are structured rigidly around particular data sources or training
approaches. To address this, we take inspiration from large language models,
where diverse tasks, both pre-training and downstream, are implicitly captured
through next-token prediction over unified token sequences, leveraging the
structure and diversity of the training data.
  We introduce SITS-DECO (Satellite Image Time Series-DECoder Only), a
proof-of-concept generative model that applies this unified-sequence framing to
EO data. Using a simple GPT-style decoder-only architecture, and demonstrate
its ability to perform useful EO tasks (pixel-wise, multi-temporal, multi-modal
crop-type classification) in a purely generative framework. Through symbolic
prompting, we show that the model can perform multiple supervised and
self-supervised tasks within a single unified architecture, without task- or
modality-specific adaptation. Despite its simplicity and lack of spatial
context, SITS-DECO outperforms much larger EO foundation models on crop-type
classification (PASTIS-R) demonstrating that dense temporal sequence modelling
is a critical missing ingredient in the current paradigm.
  This work exemplifies a data-centric modelling paradigm in which capability
arises from the diversity and structure of the training data rather than from
architectural complexity. SITS-DECO provides a lightweight, practical route to
multi-modal, multi-task EO modelling, and a conceptual bridge toward future
generative EO foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GestureGPT解决方案在识别准确性和响应时间上存在局限，需要开发更有效的自由手势理解系统来改善人机交互体验。

Method: 结合预训练大视觉语言模型、嵌入解剖学手部先验的地标处理模块，以及分步语义推理的思维链策略，构建端到端系统。

Result: 开发了首个开源自由手势意图推理数据集，包含30万标注问答对，系统实现了鲁棒且自适应的自由手势理解。

Conclusion: Gestura通过多组件协同工作，成功解决了自由手势理解中的挑战，为更自然的人机交互提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Free-form gesture understanding is highly appealing for human-computer
interaction, as it liberates users from the constraints of predefined gesture
categories. However, the sole existing solution GestureGPT suffers from limited
recognition accuracy and slow response times. In this paper, we propose
Gestura, an end-to-end system for free-form gesture understanding. Gestura
harnesses a pre-trained Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to align the highly
dynamic and diverse patterns of free-form gestures with high-level semantic
concepts. To better capture subtle hand movements across different styles, we
introduce a Landmark Processing Module that compensate for LVLMs' lack of
fine-grained domain knowledge by embedding anatomical hand priors. Further, a
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning strategy enables step-by-step semantic
inference, transforming shallow knowledge into deep semantic understanding and
significantly enhancing the model's ability to interpret ambiguous or
unconventional gestures. Together, these components allow Gestura to achieve
robust and adaptable free-form gesture comprehension. Additionally, we have
developed the first open-source dataset for free-form gesture intention
reasoning and understanding with over 300,000 annotated QA pairs.

Motivation: 分析AI文本到图像系统是否准确渲染提示中明确指定的属性，以评估模型保真度和潜在偏见。

Method: 使用两个公共数据集（200个文化创意产业女性工作者和230个博物馆策展人图像），评估个人属性、外表和随身物品的渲染准确性。

Result: DALL-E3在15.6%的属性上偏离提示要求，随身物品错误率最低，个人外表中等，人物自身描绘（特别是年龄）错误率最高。

Conclusion: 文本到图像系统存在可测量的提示保真度差距，这对偏见检测和模型评估具有重要意义。

Abstract: This study examines the prompt fidelity of ChatGPT4o / DALL-E3 text-to-image
visualisations by analysing whether attributes explicitly specified in
autogenously generated prompts are correctly rendered in the resulting images.
Using two public-domain datasets comprising 200 visualisations of women working
in the cultural and creative industries and 230 visualisations of museum
curators, the study assessed accuracy across personal attributes (age, hair),
appearance (attire, glasses), and paraphernalia (name tags, clipboards). While
correctly rendered in most cases, DALL-E3 deviated from prompt specifications
in 15.6% of all attributes (n=710). Errors were lowest for paraphernalia,
moderate for personal appearance, and highest for depictions of the person
themselves, particularly age. These findings demonstrate measurable
prompt-to-image fidelity gaps with implications for bias detection and model
evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAN生成图像的识别已成为数字图像取证的重要挑战，需要开发有效的方法来区分真实图像和GAN生成图像。

Method: 使用离散小波变换（DWT）预处理图像，将输入图像转换为多分辨率表示，然后输入ResNet50网络进行分类，利用生成过程中留下的细微伪影进行检测。

Result: Haar和Daubechies小波预处理模型的准确率分别达到93.8%和95.1%，显著高于空间域模型的81.5%。Daubechies模型表现优于Haar模型。

Conclusion: GAN生成图像在小波域具有独特的伪影或"指纹"，小波域分析在检测GAN图像方面非常有效，为未来深度伪造检测系统的开发提供了潜力。

Abstract: Identifying images generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has
become a significant challenge in digital image forensics. This research
presents a wavelet-based detection method that uses discrete wavelet transform
(DWT) preprocessing and a ResNet50 classification layer to differentiate the
StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Haar and Daubechies wavelet filters
are applied to convert the input images into multi-resolution representations,
which will then be fed to a ResNet50 network for classification, capitalizing
on subtle artifacts left by the generative process. Moreover, the wavelet-based
models are compared to an identical ResNet50 model trained on spatial data. The
Haar and Daubechies preprocessed models achieved a greater accuracy of 93.8
percent and 95.1 percent, much higher than the model developed in the spatial
domain (accuracy rate of 81.5 percent). The Daubechies-based model outperforms
Haar, showing that adding layers of descriptive frequency patterns can lead to
even greater distinguishing power. These results indicate that the
GAN-generated images have unique wavelet-domain artifacts or "fingerprints."
The method proposed illustrates the effectiveness of wavelet-domain analysis to
detect GAN images and emphasizes the potential of further developing the
capabilities of future deepfake detection systems.

Motivation: 深度学习在医学影像诊断中潜力巨大，但大多数模型缺乏可解释性，阻碍了临床信任和采用。需要开发既能提供高准确率又能解释决策过程的诊断工具。

Method: 使用ResNet50和DenseNet121两种卷积神经网络，在Kaggle数据集（7,023张脑部MRI和5,863张胸部X光）上进行训练，并集成Grad-CAM生成热力图可视化，突出显示决策过程中最具影响力的图像区域。

Result: DenseNet121在脑肿瘤检测中准确率达94.3%，肺炎检测中达89.1%，均优于ResNet50（92.5%和84.4%）。Grad-CAM显示DenseNet121更专注于核心病理区域，而ResNet50有时会分散注意力到外围或非病理区域。

Conclusion: 结合深度学习和可解释AI为开发可靠、可解释且临床有用的诊断工具提供了有前景的路径，DenseNet121在准确性和病灶关注度方面表现更优。

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) holds enormous potential for improving medical imaging
diagnostics, yet the lack of interpretability in most models hampers clinical
trust and adoption. This paper presents an explainable deep learning framework
for detecting brain tumors in MRI scans and pneumonia in chest X-ray images
using two leading Convolutional Neural Networks, ResNet50 and DenseNet121.
These models were trained on publicly available Kaggle datasets comprising
7,023 brain MRI images and 5,863 chest X-ray images, achieving high
classification performance. DenseNet121 consistently outperformed ResNet50 with
94.3 percent vs. 92.5 percent accuracy for brain tumors and 89.1 percent vs.
84.4 percent accuracy for pneumonia. For better explainability,
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was integrated to create
heatmap visualizations superimposed on the test images, indicating the most
influential image regions in the decision-making process. Interestingly, while
both models produced accurate results, Grad-CAM showed that DenseNet121
consistently focused on core pathological regions, whereas ResNet50 sometimes
scattered attention to peripheral or non-pathological areas. Combining deep
learning and explainable AI offers a promising path toward reliable,
interpretable, and clinically useful diagnostic tools.

Abstract: In the last decade, due to high resolution cameras and accurate meta-phase
analyzes, the accuracy of chromosome classification has improved substantially.
However, current Karyotyping systems demand large number of high quality train
data to have an adequately plausible Precision per each chromosome. Such
provision of high quality train data with accurate devices are not yet
accomplished in some out-reached pathological laboratories. To prevent false
positive detections in low-cost systems and low-quality images settings, this
paper improves the classification Precision of chromosomes using proposed
reliability thresholding metrics and deliberately engineered features. The
proposed method has been evaluated using a variation of deep Alex-Net neural
network, SVM, K Nearest-Neighbors, and their cascade pipelines to an automated
filtering of semi-straight chromosome. The classification results have highly
improved over 90% for the chromosomes with more common defections and
translocations. Furthermore, a comparative analysis over the proposed
thresholding metrics has been conducted and the best metric is bolded with its
salient characteristics. The high Precision results provided for a very
low-quality G-banding database verifies suitability of the proposed metrics and
pruning method for Karyotyping facilities in poor countries and lowbudget
pathological laboratories.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning with abstractive information from the visual
modality presents significant challenges for current multi-modal large language
models (MLLMs). Among the various forms of abstractive information, Multi-Modal
Relational Knowledge (MMRK), which represents abstract relational structures
between multi-modal entities using node-edge formats, remains largely
under-explored. In particular, STructured and Abstractive Reasoning (STAR) on
such data has received little attention from the research community. To bridge
the dual gaps in large-scale high-quality data and capability enhancement
methodologies, this paper makes the following key contributions: (i). An
automatic STAR data engine capable of synthesizing images with MMRK to build
multi-modal instruction data with reliable chain-of-thought thinking for
various STAR tasks and (ii). A comprehsive two-stage capability enhancement
training framework, accompanied by a suite of evaluation protocols tailored to
different STAR tasks. Based upon these contributions, we introduce STAR-64K, a
dataset comprising 64K high-quality multi-modal instruction samples, and
conduct experiments across 5 open-source MLLMs. Experimental results show that
our two-stage enhancement framework enables smaller 3B/7B models to
significantly outperform GPT-4o in STAR. Additionally, we provide in-depth
analysis regarding the effectiveness of various designs, data transferability,
and scalability.

Result: 在完整模态设置下达到最先进性能，在不完整模态场景下仍保持鲁棒且优越的准确性。

Conclusion: 所提框架能有效处理多模态医疗数据中的模态缺失问题，通过分布一致的潜在空间构建和轻量级Transformer设计，实现了稳健的多模态生存预测。

Abstract: In recent years, multimodal medical data-based survival analysis has
attracted much attention. However, real-world datasets often suffer from the
problem of incomplete modality, where some patient modality information is
missing due to acquisition limitations or system failures. Existing methods
typically infer missing modalities directly from observed ones using deep
neural networks, but they often ignore the distributional discrepancy across
modalities, resulting in inconsistent and unreliable modality reconstruction.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that combines a
low-rank Transformer with a flow-based generative model for robust and flexible
multimodal survival prediction. Specifically, we first formulate the concerned
problem as incomplete multimodal survival analysis using the multi-instance
representation of whole slide images (WSIs) and genomic profiles. To realize
incomplete multimodal survival analysis, we propose a class-specific flow for
cross-modal distribution alignment. Under the condition of class labels, we
model and transform the cross-modal distribution. By virtue of the reversible
structure and accurate density modeling capabilities of the normalizing flow
model, the model can effectively construct a distribution-consistent latent
space of the missing modality, thereby improving the consistency between the
reconstructed data and the true distribution. Finally, we design a lightweight
Transformer architecture to model intra-modal dependencies while alleviating
the overfitting problem in high-dimensional modality fusion by virtue of the
low-rank Transformer. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our method
not only achieves state-of-the-art performance under complete modality
settings, but also maintains robust and superior accuracy under the incomplete
modalities scenario.

TL;DR: 该研究比较了三种垃圾图像分类方法：传统机器学习、深度学习和混合方法，发现混合方法在三个公开数据集上表现最佳，准确率最高达100%，同时通过特征选择大幅降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前垃圾图像自动分类缺乏系统性基准测试，需要比较不同机器学习方法的性能，为全球废物管理提供有效解决方案。

Method: 比较了三种方法：(1) 基于手工特征的机器学习算法；(2) 深度学习架构（ResNet变体和EfficientNetV2S）；(3) 混合方法（深度模型特征提取+经典分类器如SVM和逻辑回归）。

Result: 混合方法在三个数据集上表现最优：TrashNet和精炼家庭垃圾数据集达到100%准确率，垃圾分类数据集达到99.87%，超越现有基准。特征选择将特征维度降低95%以上而不损失精度。

Conclusion: 该研究建立了更可靠的垃圾分类基准，提出了一种高效的混合框架，在保持高精度的同时降低推理成本，适合在资源受限环境中规模化部署。

Abstract: Automated image-based garbage classification is a critical component of
global waste management; however, systematic benchmarks that integrate Machine
Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and efficient hybrid solutions remain
underdeveloped. This study provides a comprehensive comparison of three
paradigms: (1) machine learning algorithms using handcrafted features, (2) deep
learning architectures, including ResNet variants and EfficientNetV2S, and (3)
a hybrid approach that utilizes deep models for feature extraction combined
with classical classifiers such as Support Vector Machine and Logistic
Regression to identify the most effective strategy. Experiments on three public
datasets - TrashNet, Garbage Classification, and a refined Household Garbage
Dataset (with 43 corrected mislabels)- demonstrate that the hybrid method
consistently outperforms the others, achieving up to 100% accuracy on TrashNet
and the refined Household set, and 99.87% on Garbage Classification, thereby
surpassing state-of-the-art benchmarks. Furthermore, feature selection reduces
feature dimensionality by over 95% without compromising accuracy, resulting in
faster training and inference. This work establishes more reliable benchmarks
for waste classification and introduces an efficient hybrid framework that
achieves high accuracy while reducing inference cost, making it suitable for
scalable deployment in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: 评估GPT-4o在零样本设置下对胸部X光片进行肺炎分类的能力，发现简洁的特征导向提示可获得74%准确率，但诊断可靠性仍有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索GPT-4o等大型语言模型在医学图像分类任务中的零样本能力，评估其在临床实践中的潜在应用价值。

Method: 使用平衡测试集（400张图像，每类200张），在零样本设置下测试四种不同提示设计，从最小指令到详细推理提示。

Result: 简洁特征导向提示获得最高分类准确率74%，而推理导向提示性能较低，表明模型在医学图像解释方面能力有限。

Conclusion: GPT-4o在医学图像解释方面显示出初步潜力，但诊断可靠性不足，需要进一步改进视觉推理和领域适应能力才能安全应用于临床。

Abstract: In this study, we evaluate the ability of OpenAI's gpt-4o model to classify
chest X-ray images as either NORMAL or PNEUMONIA in a zero-shot setting,
without any prior fine-tuning. A balanced test set of 400 images (200 from each
class) was used to assess performance across four distinct prompt designs,
ranging from minimal instructions to detailed, reasoning-based prompts. The
results indicate that concise, feature-focused prompts achieved the highest
classification accuracy of 74\%, whereas reasoning-oriented prompts resulted in
lower performance. These findings highlight that while ChatGPT exhibits
emerging potential for medical image interpretation, its diagnostic reliability
remains limited. Continued advances in visual reasoning and domain-specific
adaptation are required before such models can be safely applied in clinical
practice.

Motivation: 当前最先进的视频生成模型在物理理解方面存在严重限制，常常产生不合理的视频。视觉真实感并不等同于物理理解，但自监督学习在自然视频上的预训练已显示出直觉物理理解能力。

Method: 在MAGI-1视频生成模型基础上，结合Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture 2 (VJEPA-2)来引导生成过程，利用VJEPA-2作为奖励信号。

Conclusion: 自监督学习视频世界模型可以有效提升视频生成模型的物理合理性，证明了SSL方法在改善视频生成物理理解方面的潜力。

Abstract: This is a short technical report describing the winning entry of the
PhysicsIQ Challenge, presented at the Perception Test Workshop at ICCV 2025.
State-of-the-art video generative models exhibit severely limited physical
understanding, and often produce implausible videos. The Physics IQ benchmark
has shown that visual realism does not imply physics understanding. Yet,
intuitive physics understanding has shown to emerge from SSL pretraining on
natural videos. In this report, we investigate whether we can leverage
SSL-based video world models to improve the physics plausibility of video
generative models. In particular, we build ontop of the state-of-the-art video
generative model MAGI-1 and couple it with the recently introduced Video Joint
Embedding Predictive Architecture 2 (VJEPA-2) to guide the generation process.
We show that by leveraging VJEPA-2 as reward signal, we can improve the physics
plausibility of state-of-the-art video generative models by ~6%.

TL;DR: RatioWaveNet通过可训练的合理膨胀小波变换前端增强TCFormer主干网络，在BCI-IV-2a和BCI-IV-2b数据集上显著提升了最差受试者的分类准确率，同时保持计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于运动想象的脑机接口在非侵入式EEG解码中面临非平稳性、低信噪比和受试者变异性的挑战，特别是在最难处理的受试者上表现不佳。

Method: 提出RatioWaveNet，结合可训练的合理膨胀小波变换前端进行多分辨率子带分解，通过分组1-D卷积融合子带，使用多核CNN提取局部时空特征，分组查询注意力编码器处理长程上下文，紧凑TCN头进行因果时间整合。

Result: 在BCI-IV-2a和BCI-IV-2b数据集上，RatioWaveNet相比Transformer主干网络，最差受试者准确率分别提升+0.17/+0.42个百分点（受试者依赖/LOSO）和+1.07/+2.54个百分点，平均准确率也有稳定提升。

Conclusion: 简单可训练的小波前端是增强基于Transformer的脑机接口的有效插件，能够提高最坏情况下的可靠性而不牺牲效率。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on motor imagery (MI) translate covert
movement intentions into actionable commands, yet reliable decoding from
non-invasive EEG remains challenging due to nonstationarity, low SNR, and
subject variability. We present RatioWaveNet, which augments a strong temporal
CNN-Transformer backbone (TCFormer) with a trainable, Rationally-Dilated
Wavelet Transform (RDWT) front end. The RDWT performs an undecimated,
multi-resolution subband decomposition that preserves temporal length and
shift-invariance, enhancing sensorimotor rhythms while mitigating jitter and
mild artifacts; subbands are fused via lightweight grouped 1-D convolutions and
passed to a multi-kernel CNN for local temporal-spatial feature extraction, a
grouped-query attention encoder for long-range context, and a compact TCN head
for causal temporal integration.
  Our goal is to test whether this principled wavelet front end improves
robustness precisely where BCIs typically fail - on the hardest subjects - and
whether such gains persist on average across seeds under both intra- and
inter-subject protocols. On BCI-IV-2a and BCI-IV-2b, across five seeds,
RatioWaveNet improves worst-subject accuracy over the Transformer backbone by
+0.17 / +0.42 percentage points (Sub-Dependent / LOSO) on 2a and by +1.07 /
+2.54 percentage points on 2b, with consistent average-case gains and modest
computational overhead. These results indicate that a simple, trainable wavelet
front end is an effective plug-in to strengthen Transformer-based BCIs,
improving worst-case reliability without sacrificing efficiency.

TL;DR: 论文揭示了模态失语症现象：统一多模态模型能准确视觉记忆概念但无法用文字表达，尽管同时训练了图像和文本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究当前统一多模态模型存在的系统性分离问题，即模型在视觉和文本模态间表现不一致，这对AI安全框架构成潜在风险。

Method: 通过合成数据集上的受控实验，在多种架构中验证模态失语症现象，并展示仅对文本进行对齐的模型仍能生成不安全图像。

Result: 前沿模型能近乎完美复制标志性电影艺术作品，但在文字描述中混淆关键细节；模态失语症是当前统一多模态模型的基本属性而非训练伪影。

Conclusion: 模态失语症是当前多模态模型的固有缺陷，可能导致AI安全漏洞，因为单一模态的安全防护无法阻止有害概念在其他模态中的传播。

Abstract: We present modal aphasia, a systematic dissociation in which current unified
multimodal models accurately memorize concepts visually but fail to articulate
them in writing, despite being trained on images and text simultaneously. For
one, we show that leading frontier models can generate near-perfect
reproductions of iconic movie artwork, but confuse crucial details when asked
for textual descriptions. We corroborate those findings through controlled
experiments on synthetic datasets in multiple architectures. Our experiments
confirm that modal aphasia reliably emerges as a fundamental property of
current unified multimodal models, not just as a training artifact. In
practice, modal aphasia can introduce vulnerabilities in AI safety frameworks,
as safeguards applied to one modality may leave harmful concepts accessible in
other modalities. We demonstrate this risk by showing how a model aligned
solely on text remains capable of generating unsafe images.

TL;DR: SCoPE VLM是一个文档导航专家模型，通过创新的Chain of Scroll机制选择性递归导航文档，专注于相关片段，大幅降低内存使用并模拟人类阅读行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在长上下文视觉信息理解方面的挑战，特别是在GUI控制和网页导航等代理任务中。现有方法主要扩展视觉嵌入来处理长高分辨率输入，但这些方法内存密集且不适合本地部署。

Method: 提出Chain of Scroll机制选择性递归导航文档；引入专用数据生成管道构建信息丰富的Chain of Scroll轨迹；使用Episodic Group Relative Policy Optimization强化学习方法减少训练与推理之间的差距。

Result: 大幅降低内存使用；有效模拟人类阅读行为；在文档问答任务中推进多模态代理能力。

Conclusion: SCoPE VLM是首个在多页文档问答中明确建模代理阅读模式的框架，为多模态代理能力提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Understanding long-context visual information remains a fundamental challenge
for vision-language models, particularly in agentic tasks such as GUI control
and web navigation. While web pages and GUI environments are inherently
structured documents, current VLMs typically neglect decision-oriented document
understanding in their training objectives. Existing approaches primarily
extend visual embeddings to process long, high-resolution inputs, but these
methods are memory-intensive and impractical for locally deployable solutions.
To address these issues, we propose SCoPE VLM, a document navigation expert
that leverages a novel Chain of Scroll mechanism to selectively and recursively
navigate documents, focusing exclusively on relevant segments. We introduce a
dedicated data generation pipeline to construct informative Chain of Scroll
trajectories and Episodic Group Relative Policy Optimization, a tailored
reinforcement learning method to reduce the gap between training and inference.
Our method substantially reduces memory usage and effectively models human-like
reading behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, SCoPE VLM is the first
framework to explicitly model agentic reading patterns in multi-page document
question answering, advancing the capabilities of multimodal agents.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Poisson Flow一致性训练（PFCT）方法，使Poisson Flow一致性模型（PFCM）能够独立训练，无需依赖预训练的PFGM++模型，并在低剂量CT图像去噪任务中取得良好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PFCM原本只能通过蒸馏方式训练，这限制了其在多种数据模态中的潜力。本研究旨在开发一种独立的训练方法PFCT，以摆脱对预训练PFGM++模型的依赖。

Method: 利用扰动核移除预训练的PFGM++，引入正弦离散化调度和Beta噪声分布以提高适应性和样本质量。

Result: 在低剂量CT图像去噪任务中，PFCT在LPIPS和SSIM指标上改善了图像质量，去噪效果与一致性模型等现有方法相当。

Conclusion: PFCT被证明是训练PFCM的有效方法，为生成建模领域提供了更灵活的训练框架，具有与其他生成模型竞争的性能潜力。

Abstract: The Poisson Flow Consistency Model (PFCM) is a consistency-style model based
on the robust Poisson Flow Generative Model++ (PFGM++) which has achieved
success in unconditional image generation and CT image denoising. Yet the PFCM
can only be trained in distillation which limits the potential of the PFCM in
many data modalities. The objective of this research was to create a method to
train the PFCM in isolation called Poisson Flow Consistency Training (PFCT).
The perturbation kernel was leveraged to remove the pretrained PFGM++, and the
sinusoidal discretization schedule and Beta noise distribution were introduced
in order to facilitate adaptability and improve sample quality. The model was
applied to the task of low dose computed tomography image denoising and
improved the low dose image in terms of LPIPS and SSIM. It also displayed
similar denoising effectiveness as models like the Consistency Model. PFCT is
established as a valid method of training the PFCM from its effectiveness in
denoising CT images, showing potential with competitive results to other
generative models. Further study is needed in the precise optimization of PFCT
and in its applicability to other generative modeling tasks. The framework of
PFCT creates more flexibility for the ways in which a PFCM can be created and
can be applied to the field of generative modeling.

Abstract: Engineering drawings are fundamental to manufacturing communication, serving
as the primary medium for conveying design intent, tolerances, and production
details. However, interpreting complex multi-view drawings with dense
annotations remains challenging using manual methods, generic optical character
recognition (OCR) systems, or traditional deep learning approaches, due to
varied layouts, orientations, and mixed symbolic-textual content. To address
these challenges, this paper proposes a three-stage hybrid framework for the
automated interpretation of 2D multi-view engineering drawings using modern
detection and vision language models (VLMs). In the first stage, YOLOv11-det
performs layout segmentation to localize key regions such as views, title
blocks, and notes. The second stage uses YOLOv11-obb for orientation-aware,
fine-grained detection of annotations, including measures, GD&T symbols, and
surface roughness indicators. The third stage employs two Donut-based, OCR-free
VLMs for semantic content parsing: the Alphabetical VLM extracts textual and
categorical information from title blocks and notes, while the Numerical VLM
interprets quantitative data such as measures, GD&T frames, and surface
roughness. Two specialized datasets were developed to ensure robustness and
generalization: 1,000 drawings for layout detection and 1,406 for
annotation-level training. The Alphabetical VLM achieved an overall F1 score of
0.672, while the Numerical VLM reached 0.963, demonstrating strong performance
in textual and quantitative interpretation, respectively. The unified JSON
output enables seamless integration with CAD and manufacturing databases,
providing a scalable solution for intelligent engineering drawing analysis.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖显式的一热编码来表示身份和情感，限制了向未见说话者的泛化能力，且忽略了语音中固有的情感线索，影响了生成动画的自然性和适应性。

Method: 提出LSF-Animation框架，隐式从语音提取情感信息，从中性面部网格捕获身份特征；引入分层交互融合块(HIFB)，使用融合令牌集成双变换器特征，有效整合情感、运动和身份线索。

Result: 在3DMEAD数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在情感表现力、身份泛化和动画真实性方面超越了当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: LSF-Animation通过消除对显式情感和身份特征表示的依赖，实现了对未见说话者和情感状态的更好泛化，无需手动标签，提升了动画的自然性和适应性。

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation has attracted increasing interest since its
potential to generate expressive and temporally synchronized digital humans.
While recent works have begun to explore emotion-aware animation, they still
depend on explicit one-hot encodings to represent identity and emotion with
given emotion and identity labels, which limits their ability to generalize to
unseen speakers. Moreover, the emotional cues inherently present in speech are
often neglected, limiting the naturalness and adaptability of generated
animations. In this work, we propose LSF-Animation, a novel framework that
eliminates the reliance on explicit emotion and identity feature
representations. Specifically, LSF-Animation implicitly extracts emotion
information from speech and captures the identity features from a neutral
facial mesh, enabling improved generalization to unseen speakers and emotional
states without requiring manual labels. Furthermore, we introduce a
Hierarchical Interaction Fusion Block (HIFB), which employs a fusion token to
integrate dual transformer features and more effectively integrate emotional,
motion-related and identity-related cues. Extensive experiments conducted on
the 3DMEAD dataset demonstrate that our method surpasses recent
state-of-the-art approaches in terms of emotional expressiveness, identity
generalization, and animation realism. The source code will be released at:

Conclusion: 基于世界模型的架构为全自动驾驶中稳健且可泛化的运动预测展现了前景。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable motion forecasting is essential for the safe deployment
of autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in rare but safety-critical
scenarios known as corner cases. Existing models often underperform in these
situations due to an over-representation of common scenes in training data and
limited generalization capabilities. To address this limitation, we present
WM-MoE, the first world model-based motion forecasting framework that unifies
perception, temporal memory, and decision making to address the challenges of
high-risk corner-case scenarios. The model constructs a compact scene
representation that explains current observations, anticipates future dynamics,
and evaluates the outcomes of potential actions. To enhance long-horizon
reasoning, we leverage large language models (LLMs) and introduce a lightweight
temporal tokenizer that maps agent trajectories and contextual cues into the
LLM's feature space without additional training, enriching temporal context and
commonsense priors. Furthermore, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) is introduced to
decompose complex corner cases into subproblems and allocate capacity across
scenario types, and a router assigns scenes to specialized experts that infer
agent intent and perform counterfactual rollouts. In addition, we introduce
nuScenes-corner, a new benchmark that comprises four real-world corner-case
scenarios for rigorous evaluation. Extensive experiments on four benchmark
datasets (nuScenes, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD) showcase that WM-MoE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines and remains robust under
corner-case and data-missing conditions, indicating the promise of world
model-based architectures for robust and generalizable motion forecasting in
fully AVs.

Abstract: Accurate assessment of urban canopy coverage is crucial for informed urban
planning, effective environmental monitoring, and mitigating the impacts of
climate change. Traditional practices often face limitations due to inadequate
technical requirements, difficulties in scaling and data processing, and the
lack of specialized expertise. This study presents an efficient approach for
estimating green canopy coverage using artificial intelligence, specifically
computer vision techniques, applied to aerial imageries. Our proposed
methodology utilizes object-based image analysis, based on deep learning
algorithms to accurately identify and segment green canopies from
high-resolution drone images. This approach allows the user for detailed
analysis of urban vegetation, capturing variations in canopy density and
understanding spatial distribution. To overcome the computational challenges
associated with processing large datasets, it was implemented over a cloud
platform utilizing high-performance processors. This infrastructure efficiently
manages space complexity and ensures affordable latency, enabling the rapid
analysis of vast amounts of drone imageries. Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of this approach in accurately estimating canopy coverage at the
city scale, providing valuable insights for urban forestry management of an
industrial township. The resultant data generated by this method can be used to
optimize tree plantation and assess the carbon sequestration potential of urban
forests. By integrating these insights into sustainable urban planning, we can
foster more resilient urban environments, contributing to a greener and
healthier future.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in image-text contrastive
modeling, exemplified by models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining
(CLIP). In this paper, we propose the TernaryCLIP, a lightweight computational
framework that converts connection weights of both vision and text encoders of
CLIP into the ternary format, instead of full-precision or floating ones.
TernaryCLIP incorporates quantization-aware training and distillation modules,
preventing precision degradation and enabling low-cost and high-efficiency
computations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TernaryCLIP can
achieve up to 99\% ternarized weights with 1.58-bit representation, 16.98
$\times$ compression ratio, 2.3 $\times$ inference acceleration, 16 $\times$
storage reduction, 10 $\times$ memory optimization, and 60\% sparsity while
maintaining promising performance on zero-shot image classification and
image-text retrieval tasks across 41 commonly used datasets. Our work
highlights the feasibility of extreme quantization for large multimodal models,
supporting effective and efficient deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning based generative models, particularly
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and
Diffusion Models (DMs), have been instrumental in in generating diverse,
high-quality content across various domains, such as image and video synthesis.
This capability has led to widespread adoption of these models and has captured
strong public interest. As they continue to advance at a rapid pace, the
growing volume of research, expanding application areas, and unresolved
technical challenges make it increasingly difficult to stay current. To address
this need, this survey introduces a comprehensive taxonomy that organizes the
literature and provides a cohesive framework for understanding the development
of GANs, VAEs, and DMs, including their many variants and combined approaches.
We highlight key innovations that have improved the quality, diversity, and
controllability of generated outputs, reflecting the expanding potential of
generative artificial intelligence. In addition to summarizing technical
progress, we examine rising ethical concerns, including the risks of misuse and
the broader societal impact of synthetic media. Finally, we outline persistent
challenges and propose future research directions, offering a structured and
forward looking perspective for researchers in this fast evolving field.

### [163] [Sprint: Sparse-Dense Residual Fusion for Efficient Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21986)
*Dogyun Park,Moayed Haji-Ali,Yanyu Li,Willi Menapace,Sergey Tulyakov,Hyunwoo J. Kim,Aliaksandr Siarohin,Anil Kag*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPRINT是一种高效的扩散变换器训练方法，通过分层token丢弃策略（浅层处理所有token，深层处理稀疏子集）和两阶段训练，在保持生成质量的同时大幅降低训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器(DiTs)虽然性能优异，但二次训练成本使其大规模预训练极其昂贵。现有token丢弃方法要么参数过多，要么在高丢弃率下性能下降严重。

Method: 采用稀疏-稠密残差融合：浅层处理所有token捕获局部细节，深层处理稀疏子集减少计算，通过残差连接融合输出。采用两阶段训练：长掩码预训练+短全token微调。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K 256x256上，SPRINT实现9.8倍训练节省，FID/FDD性能相当。推理时Path-Drop Guidance(PDG)几乎减半FLOPs同时提升质量。

Conclusion: SPRINT为高效DiT训练提供了一个简单、有效且通用的解决方案，能在激进token丢弃（高达75%）下保持生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) deliver state-of-the-art generative performance
but their quadratic training cost with sequence length makes large-scale
pretraining prohibitively expensive. Token dropping can reduce training cost,
yet na\"ive strategies degrade representations, and existing methods are either
parameter-heavy or fail at high drop ratios. We present SPRINT, Sparse--Dense
Residual Fusion for Efficient Diffusion Transformers, a simple method that
enables aggressive token dropping (up to 75%) while preserving quality. SPRINT
leverages the complementary roles of shallow and deep layers: early layers
process all tokens to capture local detail, deeper layers operate on a sparse
subset to cut computation, and their outputs are fused through residual
connections. Training follows a two-stage schedule: long masked pre-training
for efficiency followed by short full-token fine-tuning to close the
train--inference gap. On ImageNet-1K 256x256, SPRINT achieves 9.8x training
savings with comparable FID/FDD, and at inference, its Path-Drop Guidance (PDG)
nearly halves FLOPs while improving quality. These results establish SPRINT as
a simple, effective, and general solution for efficient DiT training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lite-Diff是一种轻量级扩散模型微调方法，通过冻结基础模型权重并优化小型残差适配器模块，显著降低计算开销并防止过拟合，特别适用于数据稀缺的医学影像领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像合成方面表现出色，但在医学影像等专业领域的微调面临挑战，包括领域特定数据有限和完整模型适配计算成本高的问题。

Method: 在冻结的扩散U-Net中集成轻量级适配层，结合潜在形态自编码器（用于领域特定潜在一致性）和像素级判别器（用于对抗对齐）增强训练。

Result: 在三个胸部X光数据集上的实验表明，与完整微调相比，Lite-Diff实现了更优的适配效率。

Conclusion: 该框架为扩散模型中的迁移学习提供了有前景的方向，促进了其在各种低数据领域的部署。

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in
high-fidelity image synthesis. However, fine-tuning these models for
specialized domains, such as medical imaging, remains challenging due to
limited domain-specific data and the high computational cost of full model
adaptation. In this paper, we introduce Lite-Diff (Lightweight Diffusion Model
Adaptation), a novel finetuning approach that integrates lightweight adaptation
layers into a frozen diffusion U-Net while enhancing training with a latent
morphological autoencoder (for domain-specific latent consistency) and a pixel
level discriminator(for adversarial alignment). By freezing weights of the base
model and optimizing only small residual adapter modules, LiteDiff
significantly reduces the computational overhead and mitigates overfitting,
even in minimal-data settings. Additionally, we conduct ablation studies to
analyze the effects of selectively integrating adaptation layers in different
U-Net blocks, revealing an optimal balance between efficiency and performance.
Experiments on three chest X-ray datasets - (1) Kaggle Chest X-Ray Pneumonia,
(2) NIH Chest X-ray14 and (3) VinBigData Chest X_ray demonstrate that LiteDiff
achieves superior adaptation efficiency compared to naive full fine-tuning. Our
framework provides a promising direction for transfer learning in diffusion
models, facilitating their deployment in diverse low data domains.

*Or Ronai,Vladimir Kulikov,Tomer Michaeli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowOpt是一个零阶优化框架，将整个扩散/流匹配采样过程视为黑盒，无需反向传播即可在整个采样路径上进行优化，用于图像编辑等控制生成任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于扩散和流匹配模型的迭代采样过程计算成本高，无法使用基于梯度的优化直接控制最终生成的图像，现有方法只能分别操作每个时间步。

Method: 提出FlowOpt零阶优化框架，将整个流过程视为黑盒，通过整个采样路径进行优化而无需反向传播，允许监控中间结果和提前停止。

Result: FlowOpt在图像编辑任务中达到最先进水平，使用与现有方法大致相同的神经网络函数评估次数，可用于图像反演和直接引导编辑。

Conclusion: FlowOpt提供了一种高效、可监控的优化方法，能够在扩散和流匹配模型中实现控制生成，同时保证了收敛性。

Abstract: The remarkable success of diffusion and flow-matching models has ignited a
surge of works on adapting them at test time for controlled generation tasks.
Examples range from image editing to restoration, compression and
personalization. However, due to the iterative nature of the sampling process
in those models, it is computationally impractical to use gradient-based
optimization to directly control the image generated at the end of the process.
As a result, existing methods typically resort to manipulating each timestep
separately. Here we introduce FlowOpt - a zero-order (gradient-free)
optimization framework that treats the entire flow process as a black box,
enabling optimization through the whole sampling path without backpropagation
through the model. Our method is both highly efficient and allows users to
monitor the intermediate optimization results and perform early stopping if
desired. We prove a sufficient condition on FlowOpt's step-size, under which
convergence to the global optimum is guaranteed. We further show how to
empirically estimate this upper bound so as to choose an appropriate step-size.
We demonstrate how FlowOpt can be used for image editing, showcasing two
options: (i) inversion (determining the initial noise that generates a given
image), and (ii) directly steering the edited image to be similar to the source
image while conforming to a target text prompt. In both cases, FlowOpt achieves
state-of-the-art results while using roughly the same number of neural function
evaluations (NFEs) as existing methods. Code and examples are available on the
project's webpage.

Motivation: 手语在聋人社区沟通中至关重要，但常被边缘化，限制了医疗、教育等基本服务的获取。

Method: 采用CNN-LSTM混合架构，使用Mediapipe进行手势关键点提取，基于Python、TensorFlow和Streamlit开发实时手势翻译系统。

Result: 系统平均准确率为92%，对"Hello"和"Thank you"等明显手势表现良好，但对"Call"和"Yes"等视觉相似手势仍存在混淆。

Conclusion: 这项工作为医疗、教育和公共服务等领域的应用开辟了有趣的前景。

Abstract: Sign languages play a crucial role in the communication of deaf communities,
but they are often marginalized, limiting access to essential services such as
healthcare and education. This study proposes an automatic sign language
recognition system based on a hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture, using Mediapipe for
gesture keypoint extraction. Developed with Python, TensorFlow and Streamlit,
the system provides real-time gesture translation. The results show an average
accuracy of 92\%, with very good performance for distinct gestures such as
``Hello'' and ``Thank you''. However, some confusions remain for visually
similar gestures, such as ``Call'' and ``Yes''. This work opens up interesting
perspectives for applications in various fields such as healthcare, education
and public services.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的显著性图方法在像素空间重叠时可能产生误导，需要更可靠的可解释方法来避免模型受到协变量偏移的影响。

Method: 使用新颖的网络手术方法将待解释模型集成到对比语言-图像预训练(CLIP)模型中，生成基于字幕的解释。

Result: 该方法能够识别对模型预测贡献最大的主导概念，最小化模型因协变量偏移而误判的风险。

Conclusion: 基于字幕的XAI方法为开发更鲁棒的机器学习模型提供了重要贡献，能够更可靠地解释模型行为。

Abstract: Robustness has become one of the most critical problems in machine learning
(ML). The science of interpreting ML models to understand their behavior and
improve their robustness is referred to as explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI). One of the state-of-the-art XAI methods for computer vision problems is
to generate saliency maps. A saliency map highlights the pixel space of an
image that excites the ML model the most. However, this property could be
misleading if spurious and salient features are present in overlapping pixel
spaces. In this paper, we propose a caption-based XAI method, which integrates
a standalone model to be explained into the contrastive language-image
pre-training (CLIP) model using a novel network surgery approach. The resulting
caption-based XAI model identifies the dominant concept that contributes the
most to the models prediction. This explanation minimizes the risk of the
standalone model falling for a covariate shift and contributes significantly
towards developing robust ML models.

*Hyeonsu Kang,Emily Bao,Anjan Goswami*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLM-SlideEval框架评估视觉语言模型在幻灯片理解上的表现，发现当前模型在像素级元素提取和跨幻灯片叙事结构理解方面存在局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型越来越多地用于评估多模态内容（包括演示幻灯片），但它们在幻灯片特定理解方面的能力尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 引入VLM-SlideEval评估框架，从三个维度测试VLMs：元素级提取、对抗扰动的鲁棒性以及高级理解能力（如从乱序幻灯片恢复叙事顺序）。

Result: VLMs在像素级提取方面表现不佳，在受控扰动下显示出非平凡的协议、保真度和一致性，在单幻灯片内容理解方面表现较好，但无法可靠地捕捉跨幻灯片的叙事结构。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在幻灯片评估方面存在局限性，需要开发经过校准的、包含批评者的循环评估器，以驱动智能管道中的迭代优化和选择。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate multimodal
content, including presentation slides, yet their slide-specific understanding
remains underexplored {despite their growing role as critics in agentic,
model-forward pipelines}. We introduce VLM-SlideEval, an evaluation framework
that probes VLMs along three axes: (1) element-level extraction from slide
images aligned to ground truth; (2) robustness to controlled perturbations in
geometry, style, and text; and (3) higher-level comprehension, such as
recovering a deck's narrative order from shuffled slides. Using publicly
available decks from Zenodo
(https://huggingface.co/datasets/Forceless/Zenodo10K/viewer/default/pptx), we
standardize ground-truth element metadata from PowerPoint XML and live
renderings into a unified, verifiable schema. Empirically, VLMs underperform on
pixel-accurate extraction and show non-trivial agreement, fidelity, and
consistency under controlled perturbations, while performing better on
single-slide content understanding; however, they do not reliably capture
narrative structure across slides. These results highlight the limits of
current VLMs for slide evaluation and motivate calibrated, critic-in-the-loop
evaluators that drive iterative refinement and selection in agentic pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个结合人类中心预处理和时空建模的深度学习框架，用于监控视频中的多类异常检测，在UCF-Crime数据集上达到92.41%的平均准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决监控视频异常检测面临的挑战：异常事件多样性、类别不平衡和场景相关的视觉干扰。

Method: 使用YOLO-World检测人类实例，ByteTrack进行身份跟踪，高斯模糊抑制背景，InceptionV3提取空间特征，BiLSTM捕获时序动态。

Result: 在UCF-Crime五类子集上平均测试准确率92.41%，各类F1分数均超过0.85，表现出良好的泛化能力和对类别不平衡的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 聚焦前景的预处理方法显著提升了真实监控场景中的异常识别能力。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in surveillance videos remains a challenging task due to
the diversity of abnormal events, class imbalance, and scene-dependent visual
clutter. To address these issues, we propose a robust deep learning framework
that integrates human-centric preprocessing with spatio-temporal modeling for
multi-class anomaly classification. Our pipeline begins by applying YOLO-World
- an open-vocabulary vision-language detector - to identify human instances in
raw video clips, followed by ByteTrack for consistent identity-aware tracking.
Background regions outside detected bounding boxes are suppressed via Gaussian
blurring, effectively reducing scene-specific distractions and focusing the
model on behaviorally relevant foreground content. The refined frames are then
processed by an ImageNet-pretrained InceptionV3 network for spatial feature
extraction, and temporal dynamics are captured using a bidirectional LSTM
(BiLSTM) for sequence-level classification. Evaluated on a five-class subset of
the UCF-Crime dataset (Normal, Burglary, Fighting, Arson, Explosion), our
method achieves a mean test accuracy of 92.41% across three independent trials,
with per-class F1-scores consistently exceeding 0.85. Comprehensive evaluation
metrics - including confusion matrices, ROC curves, and macro/weighted averages
- demonstrate strong generalization and resilience to class imbalance. The
results confirm that foreground-focused preprocessing significantly enhances
anomaly discrimination in real-world surveillance scenarios.

*Zheng Qi,Chao Shang,Evangelia Spiliopoulou,Nikolaos Pappas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GIFT方法，通过追踪视觉注意力变化生成显著性图，在解码过程中同时增强显著视觉信息和用户查询的注意力，有效减少VLM中的幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要归因于VLM过度依赖语言先验知识而非视觉输入，但忽略了视觉注意力沉没问题（注意力被错误分配到无关视觉区域）和跨模态融合平衡问题。

Method: GIFT方法预计算整体视觉显著性图，通过追踪用户查询理解过程中的视觉注意力正向变化（"注视转移"），利用该图在每一步解码中同时增强显著视觉信息和用户查询的注意力。

Result: 实验表明GIFT在生成和分类任务中有效减少VLM幻觉，相比贪婪解码提升达20.7%，同时保持一般视觉语言性能且计算开销低。

Conclusion: GIFT通过解决视觉注意力沉没和跨模态融合不平衡问题，能够有效缓解VLM中的幻觉现象，是一种简单而有效的方法。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) often generate hallucination, i.e., content
that cannot be substantiated by either textual or visual inputs. Prior work
primarily attributes this to over-reliance on linguistic prior knowledge rather
than visual inputs. Some methods attempt to mitigate hallucination by
amplifying visual token attention proportionally to their attention scores.
However, these methods overlook the visual attention sink problem, where
attention is frequently misallocated to task-irrelevant visual regions, and
neglect cross-modal fusion balance by enhancing only visual attention without
adjusting attention to the user query. This can result in amplifying incorrect
areas while failing to properly interpret the user query. To address these
challenges, we propose a simple yet effective method called Gaze Shift-Guided
Cross-modal Fusion Enhancement (GIFT). GIFT pre-computes a holistic visual
saliency map by tracking positive changes in visual attention, or "gaze
shifts", during user query comprehension, and leverages this map to amplify
attention to both salient visual information and the user query at each
decoding step. This reduces the impact of visual attention sink, as irrelevant
tokens exhibit minimal shifts, while ensuring balanced cross-modal fusion for
well-integrated representation. Extensive experiments show that GIFT
effectively mitigates hallucination in VLMs across both generative and
classification tasks, achieving up to 20.7% improvement over greedy decoding,
while maintaining general vision-language performance with low computational
overhead.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于图像的3D T1加权脑MRI协调框架，通过解耦解剖内容和扫描器/站点特定变化来减少多中心研究中的变异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI扫描器型号、采集协议和成像站点的差异导致多中心研究分析不一致和泛化性差，需要一种方法来协调不同站点的图像数据。

Method: 使用基于结构相似性指数(SSIM)的可微分损失函数，分离评估图像亮度、对比度和结构成分，通过多风格目标训练实现图像协调。

Result: 协调后结构SSIM达到0.97，亮度SSIM为0.98-0.99，Wasserstein距离显著降低。脑年龄预测MAE从5.36年降至3.30年，阿尔茨海默病分类AUC从0.78提升至0.85。

Conclusion: 该框架增强了跨站点图像一致性，保持了解剖保真度，并改善了下游模型性能，为大规模多中心神经影像研究提供了稳健且可泛化的解决方案。

Abstract: The variability introduced by differences in MRI scanner models, acquisition
protocols, and imaging sites hinders consistent analysis and generalizability
across multicenter studies. We present a novel image-based harmonization
framework for 3D T1-weighted brain MRI, which disentangles anatomical content
from scanner- and site-specific variations. The model incorporates a
differentiable loss based on the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) to preserve
biologically meaningful features while reducing inter-site variability. This
loss enables separate evaluation of image luminance, contrast, and structural
components. Training and validation were performed on multiple publicly
available datasets spanning diverse scanners and sites, with testing on both
healthy and clinical populations. Harmonization using multiple style targets,
including style-agnostic references, produced consistent and high-quality
outputs. Visual comparisons, voxel intensity distributions, and SSIM-based
metrics demonstrated that harmonized images achieved strong alignment across
acquisition settings while maintaining anatomical fidelity. Following
harmonization, structural SSIM reached 0.97, luminance SSIM ranged from 0.98 to
0.99, and Wasserstein distances between mean voxel intensity distributions
decreased substantially. Downstream tasks showed substantial improvements: mean
absolute error for brain age prediction decreased from 5.36 to 3.30 years, and
Alzheimer's disease classification AUC increased from 0.78 to 0.85. Overall,
our framework enhances cross-site image consistency, preserves anatomical
fidelity, and improves downstream model performance, providing a robust and
generalizable solution for large-scale multicenter neuroimaging studies.

TL;DR: 本文研究了多模态大语言模型在坐标预测中的位置编码问题，提出了Vision-PE Shuffle Guidance方法来解决高分辨率输入导致的坐标偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中表现出色，但在精确坐标预测方面存在困难，特别是高分辨率输入会产生长token序列，削弱位置编码并引入方向性偏差。

Method: 提出Vision-PE Shuffle Guidance方法，通过扰乱视觉位置编码来分析模型行为，利用辅助解码分离位置无关倾向，使用轻量级有限状态机指导数字预测。

Result: 在ScreenSpot-Pro数据集上的实验表明，该方法能可靠地改善坐标预测性能，证明了位置编码鲁棒性对MLLMs空间推理的重要性。

Conclusion: 位置编码失效是精确坐标预测的关键瓶颈，Vision-PE Shuffle Guidance方法能有效纠正方向性偏差，提升多模态大语言模型的空间推理能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at vision-language tasks such
as VQA and document understanding, yet precise coordinate prediction remains
challenging. High-resolution inputs exacerbate this difficulty by producing
long token sequences that weaken positional encodings and introduce directional
biases in coordinate outputs. We investigate this phenomenon by analyzing how
MLLMs behave when visual positional encodings (VPEs) are deliberately perturbed
through shuffling. Our analysis reveals that such perturbations induce
predictable, non-random coordinate biases rather than random errors, suggesting
that models rely on internal positional priors when spatial grounding signals
are degraded. Crucially, we observe similar directional error patterns in
natural high-resolution datasets, indicating that positional encoding failures
are a key bottleneck for accurate coordinate prediction at scale. To address
this issue, we propose Vision-PE Shuffle Guidance (VPSG), a training-free
test-time method that leverages the directional nature of these biases for
correction. VPSG runs auxiliary decoding with shuffled VPEs to isolate
position-unconditioned tendencies, then uses this as negative evidence to guide
digit prediction while preserving coordinate format through a lightweight
finite-state machine. Experiments on ScreenSpot-Pro demonstrate reliable
improvements, highlighting positional encoding robustness as a critical factor
for spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

<details>

Motivation: 传统方法在条件图像生成中难以产生有意义的多样性，要么通过修改随机种子导致难以区分差异，要么通过多样化输入提示但受限于语言可解释的多样性。

Method: 在提示表示计算中集成由GFlowNets参数化的潜在图，利用GFlowNets的高级图采样能力捕捉不确定性并生成多样化的轨迹，从而产生多样化的条件表示和相应的输出图像。

Result: 在自然图像和医学图像数据集上的评估表明，Rainbow在图像合成、图像生成和反事实生成任务中在多样性和保真度方面都有改进。

Conclusion: Rainbow框架能够有效处理条件/提示中的不确定性，生成多样化的合理图像，适用于任何预训练的条件生成模型。

Abstract: Capturing diversity is crucial in conditional and prompt-based image
generation, particularly when conditions contain uncertainty that can lead to
multiple plausible outputs. To generate diverse images reflecting this
diversity, traditional methods often modify random seeds, making it difficult
to discern meaningful differences between samples, or diversify the input
prompt, which is limited in verbally interpretable diversity. We propose
Rainbow, a novel conditional image generation framework, applicable to any
pretrained conditional generative model, that addresses inherent
condition/prompt uncertainty and generates diverse plausible images. Rainbow is
based on a simple yet effective idea: decomposing the input condition into
diverse latent representations, each capturing an aspect of the uncertainty and
generating a distinct image. First, we integrate a latent graph, parameterized
by Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets), into the prompt representation
computation. Second, leveraging GFlowNets' advanced graph sampling capabilities
to capture uncertainty and output diverse trajectories over the graph, we
produce multiple trajectories that collectively represent the input condition,
leading to diverse condition representations and corresponding output images.
Evaluations on natural image and medical image datasets demonstrate Rainbow's
improvement in both diversity and fidelity across image synthesis, image
generation, and counterfactual generation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在空间推理任务上表现不佳，主要原因是现有数据生成方法存在局限性：单图像3D重建会引入级联建模误差，而基于描述的方法需要超详细标注且容易产生生成幻觉。

Method: GRAID基于关键洞察——定性空间关系可以仅从2D几何基元可靠确定。通过仅使用标准物体检测器的2D边界框，避免了3D重建误差和生成幻觉。

Result: 在BDD100k、NuImages和Waymo数据集上生成了超过850万个高质量VQA对，涵盖空间关系、计数、排序和大小比较等问题类型。人类验证准确率达到91.16%，相比现有方法的57.6%有显著提升。模型在6种问题类型上微调后，能在10多种保留类型上泛化，准确率提升47.5%（BDD）和37.9%（NuImages）。

Conclusion: GRAID框架能够生成高质量的空间推理训练数据，显著提升视觉语言模型的空间推理能力，并具有良好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on many
vision-language tasks but often struggle with spatial reasoning\textemdash{}a
prerequisite for many applications. Empirically, we find that a dataset
produced by a current training data generation pipeline has a 57.6\% human
validation rate. These rates stem from current limitations: single-image 3D
reconstruction introduces cascading modeling errors and requires wide answer
tolerances, while caption-based methods require hyper-detailed annotations and
suffer from generative hallucinations. We present GRAID, built on the key
insight that qualitative spatial relationships can be reliably determined from
2D geometric primitives alone. By operating exclusively on 2D bounding boxes
from standard object detectors, GRAID avoids both 3D reconstruction errors and
generative hallucinations, resulting in datasets that are of higher quality
than existing tools that produce similar datasets as validated by human
evaluations. We apply our framework to the BDD100k, NuImages, and Waymo
datasets, generating over 8.5 million high-quality VQA pairs creating questions
spanning spatial relations, counting, ranking, and size comparisons. We
evaluate one of the datasets and find it achieves 91.16\% human-validated
accuracy\textemdash{}compared to 57.6\% on a dataset generated by recent work.
% or recent work Critically, we demonstrate that when trained on GRAID data,
models learn spatial reasoning concepts that generalize: models fine-tuned on 6
question types improve on over 10 held-out types, with accuracy gains of 47.5\%
on BDD and 37.9\% on NuImages for Llama 3.2B 11B, and when trained on all

Result: 在Scene Flow、KITTI、Middlebury、ETH3D、EuRoc和真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，CogStereo不仅实现了最先进的结果，而且在跨域泛化方面表现出色。

Conclusion: CogStereo将立体视觉转向认知驱动的方法，即使在几何信息不足的区域也能确保结构一致的视差估计，展示了卓越的零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: Deep stereo matching has advanced significantly on benchmark datasets through
fine-tuning but falls short of the zero-shot generalization seen in foundation
models in other vision tasks. We introduce CogStereo, a novel framework that
addresses challenging regions, such as occlusions or weak textures, without
relying on dataset-specific priors. CogStereo embeds implicit spatial cognition
into the refinement process by using monocular depth features as priors,
capturing holistic scene understanding beyond local correspondences. This
approach ensures structurally coherent disparity estimation, even in areas
where geometry alone is inadequate. CogStereo employs a dual-conditional
refinement mechanism that combines pixel-wise uncertainty with cognition-guided
features for consistent global correction of mismatches. Extensive experiments
on Scene Flow, KITTI, Middlebury, ETH3D, EuRoc, and real-world demonstrate that
CogStereo not only achieves state-of-the-art results but also excels in
cross-domain generalization, shifting stereo vision towards a cognition-driven
approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了CLIP模型在输入损坏下的表现，发现了嵌入方差崩溃现象，并提出Mint方法来通过最大化伪标签的类间方差来提升鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的视觉语言模型如CLIP在零样本泛化方面表现强劲，但对输入损坏引起的分布偏移仍然脆弱。本文旨在探究损坏如何影响CLIP的图像嵌入，并找到提升鲁棒性的方法。

Method: 提出了Mint方法，这是一种简单的测试时适应方法，通过均值累加器和梯度累加器实时最大化基于伪标签的类间方差。该方法能在小批量大小下有效运行。

Result: Mint方法在多个损坏基准测试和CLIP架构中一致提升了性能，证明了通过最大化类间方差可以有效增强嵌入质量。

Conclusion: 嵌入方差崩溃是CLIP在输入损坏下性能下降的关键因素，而最大化类间方差（即使是基于伪标签估计的）能够可证明地提升嵌入质量，Mint方法为此提供了一个有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot
generalization but remain vulnerable to distribution shifts caused by input
corruptions. In this work, we investigate how corruptions affect CLIP's image
embeddings and uncover a consistent phenomenon we term as embedding variance
collapse, where both intra-class and inter-class variances shrink as corruption
severity increases. We find that this collapse is closely tied to performance
degradation, with inter-class variance strongly correlated with classification
accuracy. To explain this phenomenon, we analyze how corruptions alter the
structure of the embedding space. Our theoretical results suggest that the
visual encoder tends to encode corruption-related signals, which dilute
class-discriminative features and compress the representation geometry. We
further show that maximizing inter-class variance, even when estimated from
pseudo-labels, can provably enhance embedding quality. Based on this insight,
we propose Mint, a simple test-time adaptation method that maximizes
pseudo-label-based inter-class variance on the fly using a mean accumulator and
a gradient accumulator. Mint operates effectively with small batch sizes and
consistently improves performance across multiple corruption benchmarks and
CLIP architectures. Our code is available at https://github.com/baowenxuan/Mint .

*Matthias Jammot,Bjöern Braun,Paul Streli,Rafael Wampfler,Christian Holz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了egoEMOTION数据集，这是首个结合自我中心视觉和生理信号与情绪、人格密集自我报告的数据集，包含50+小时记录，定义了三个基准任务：连续情感分类、离散情绪分类和人格特质推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自我中心视觉基准主要忽略情绪状态对行为的影响，假设中性情感和统一人格，限制了视觉系统捕捉行为内部驱动因素的能力。

Method: 使用Meta Project Aria眼镜记录43名参与者的同步眼动视频、光电容积描记、惯性运动数据和生理基线，参与者完成情绪诱发任务和自然活动，使用Circumplex模型、Mikels轮和五因素模型自我报告情感状态和人格。

Result: 基于经典学习方法在真实世界情感预测中，从自我中心视觉系统捕获的信号比处理生理信号产生更好的估计结果。

Conclusion: 该数据集将情绪和人格确立为自我中心感知的核心维度，为基于情感的行为、意图和交互建模开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Understanding affect is central to anticipating human behavior, yet current
egocentric vision benchmarks largely ignore the person's emotional states that
shape their decisions and actions. Existing tasks in egocentric perception
focus on physical activities, hand-object interactions, and attention modeling
- assuming neutral affect and uniform personality. This limits the ability of
vision systems to capture key internal drivers of behavior. In this paper, we
present egoEMOTION, the first dataset that couples egocentric visual and
physiological signals with dense self-reports of emotion and personality across
controlled and real-world scenarios. Our dataset includes over 50 hours of
recordings from 43 participants, captured using Meta's Project Aria glasses.
Each session provides synchronized eye-tracking video, headmounted
photoplethysmography, inertial motion data, and physiological baselines for
reference. Participants completed emotion-elicitation tasks and naturalistic
activities while self-reporting their affective state using the Circumplex
Model and Mikels' Wheel as well as their personality via the Big Five model. We
define three benchmark tasks: (1) continuous affect classification (valence,
arousal, dominance); (2) discrete emotion classification; and (3) trait-level
personality inference. We show that a classical learning-based method, as a
simple baseline in real-world affect prediction, produces better estimates from
signals captured on egocentric vision systems than processing physiological
signals. Our dataset establishes emotion and personality as core dimensions in
egocentric perception and opens new directions in affect-driven modeling of
behavior, intent, and interaction.

TL;DR: STG-Avatar是一个基于3DGS的高保真可动画人体化身重建框架，通过刚性-非刚性耦合变形框架结合时空高斯和线性混合蒙皮，解决了非刚性物体细节和动态区域准确表示的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从单目视频中创建逼真的可动画人体化身对于推进人机交互和增强沉浸式虚拟体验至关重要。现有3DGS方法在表示非刚性物体细节和动态区域方面仍存在困难。

Method: 提出刚性-非刚性耦合变形框架，将时空高斯与线性混合蒙皮协同集成。LBS通过驱动全局姿态变换实现实时骨骼控制，STG通过3D高斯的时空自适应优化进行补充，并使用光流识别高动态区域指导自适应密集化。

Conclusion: STG-Avatar框架通过结合时空高斯和线性混合蒙皮的混合设计，成功解决了3DGS人体化身在非刚性变形和动态区域表示方面的挑战，实现了高保真重建和实时渲染。

Abstract: Realistic animatable human avatars from monocular videos are crucial for
advancing human-robot interaction and enhancing immersive virtual experiences.
While recent research on 3DGS-based human avatars has made progress, it still
struggles with accurately representing detailed features of non-rigid objects
(e.g., clothing deformations) and dynamic regions (e.g., rapidly moving limbs).
To address these challenges, we present STG-Avatar, a 3DGS-based framework for
high-fidelity animatable human avatar reconstruction. Specifically, our
framework introduces a rigid-nonrigid coupled deformation framework that
synergistically integrates Spacetime Gaussians (STG) with linear blend skinning
(LBS). In this hybrid design, LBS enables real-time skeletal control by driving
global pose transformations, while STG complements it through spacetime
adaptive optimization of 3D Gaussians. Furthermore, we employ optical flow to
identify high-dynamic regions and guide the adaptive densification of 3D
Gaussians in these regions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both reconstruction
quality and operational efficiency, achieving superior quantitative metrics
while retaining real-time rendering capabilities. Our code is available at

Motivation: 解决3D数据集有限导致视觉语言模型在3D场景理解中应用受限的问题，开发一个能有效处理开放集挑战的通用框架。

Method: 提出LOC框架，融合多帧LiDAR点云进行泊松重建填补空洞，使用KNN为体素分配语义，引入密集对比学习(DCL)避免特征同质化，在CLIP特征空间中预测体素特征。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上表现出色，能够高精度预测已知类别并区分未知类别，无需额外训练数据。

Conclusion: LOC框架有效解决了3D场景理解的开放集挑战，通过语言引导和密集对比学习实现了优异的性能，为3D视觉语言模型的应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown significant progress in open-set
challenges. However, the limited availability of 3D datasets hinders their
effective application in 3D scene understanding. We propose LOC, a general
language-guided framework adaptable to various occupancy networks, supporting
both supervised and self-supervised learning paradigms. For self-supervised
tasks, we employ a strategy that fuses multi-frame LiDAR points for
dynamic/static scenes, using Poisson reconstruction to fill voids, and
assigning semantics to voxels via K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to obtain
comprehensive voxel representations. To mitigate feature over-homogenization
caused by direct high-dimensional feature distillation, we introduce Densely
Contrastive Learning (DCL). DCL leverages dense voxel semantic information and
predefined textual prompts. This efficiently enhances open-set recognition
without dense pixel-level supervision, and our framework can also leverage
existing ground truth to further improve performance. Our model predicts dense
voxel features embedded in the CLIP feature space, integrating textual and
image pixel information, and classifies based on text and semantic similarity.
Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the method's superior
performance, achieving high-precision predictions for known classes and
distinguishing unknown classes without additional training data.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>

Motivation: 源自由域自适应任务中，现有方法主要关注域偏移而忽视了负迁移的影响，这会阻碍模型在适应过程中的性能提升。

Method: 使用注意力机制捕获目标对象的判别区域，在每层进行空间和通道注意力的跨层残差融合和自蒸馏；对比全局和局部表示以提升类别感知能力；采用动态质心评估策略评估可信质心和标签。

Result: 在五个不同规模的基准测试上进行实验，结果表明该方法超越了其他技术，在SFDA基准上取得了优越性能。

Conclusion: ARFNet框架通过注意力残差融合、对比学习和动态质心评估，有效缓解了源自由域自适应中的负迁移和域偏移问题，取得了state-of-the-art的性能。

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) involves training a model on source
domain and then applying it to a related target domain without access to the
source data and labels during adaptation. The complexity of scene information
and lack of the source domain make SFDA a difficult task. Recent studies have
shown promising results, but many approaches to domain adaptation concentrate
on domain shift and neglect the effects of negative transfer, which may impede
enhancements of model performance during adaptation. n this paper, addressing
this issue, we propose a novel framework of Attention Residual Fusion Network
(ARFNet) based on contrast learning for SFDA to alleviate negative transfer and
domain shift during the progress of adaptation, in which attention residual
fusion, global-local attention contrast, and dynamic centroid evaluation are
exploited. Concretely, the attention mechanism is first exploited to capture
the discriminative region of the target object. Then, in each block, attention
features are decomposed into spatial-wise and channel-wise attentions to
achieve the cross-layer attention residual fusion progressively and
self-distillation. During adaptation progress, we contrast global and local
representations to improve the perceptual capabilities of different categories,
which enables the model to discriminate variations between inner-class and
intra-class. Finally, a dynamic centroid evaluation strategy is exploited to
evaluate the trustworthy centroids and labels for self-supervised
self-distillation, which aims to accurately approximate the center of the
source domain and pseudo-labels to mitigate domain shift. To validate the
efficacy, we execute comprehensive experiments on five benchmarks of varying
scales. Experimental outcomes indicate that our method surpasses other
techniques, attaining superior performance across SFDA benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: I2-NeRF是一个新颖的神经辐射场框架，通过反向分层上采样策略和统一的辐射传输公式，在媒体退化条件下增强等距和各向同性度量感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NeRF模型主要依赖物体中心采样，缺乏对3D空间均匀采样的关注，无法在媒体退化条件下保持等距和各向同性度量感知。

Method: 提出反向分层上采样策略实现3D空间近均匀采样，建立统一的辐射传输公式，将发射、吸收和散射统一到受Beer-Lambert衰减定律控制的粒子模型中。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比现有方法显著提高了重建保真度和物理合理性，并能估计水深度等介质属性。

Conclusion: I2-NeRF通过创新的采样策略和辐射传输建模，成功增强了在复杂媒体环境下的等距和各向同性度量感知能力。

Abstract: Participating in efforts to endow generative AI with the 3D physical world
perception, we propose I2-NeRF, a novel neural radiance field framework that
enhances isometric and isotropic metric perception under media degradation.
While existing NeRF models predominantly rely on object-centric sampling,
I2-NeRF introduces a reverse-stratified upsampling strategy to achieve
near-uniform sampling across 3D space, thereby preserving isometry. We further
present a general radiative formulation for media degradation that unifies
emission, absorption, and scattering into a particle model governed by the
Beer-Lambert attenuation law. By composing the direct and media-induced
in-scatter radiance, this formulation extends naturally to complex media
environments such as underwater, haze, and even low-light scenes. By treating
light propagation uniformly in both vertical and horizontal directions, I2-NeRF
enables isotropic metric perception and can even estimate medium properties
such as water depth. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method significantly improves both reconstruction fidelity and physical
plausibility compared to existing approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于概率的不确定性估计方法难以捕捉语义和文本标记之间的复杂多模态关系，且容易受到语言先验的影响而产生偏差概率。

Method: 提出HARMONY框架，同时利用模型激活中的融合多模态信息和VLM的输出分布来确定响应的可靠性。

Result: 在三个开放VQA基准测试和三个最先进VLM上的实验表明，该方法在AUROC上提升达4%，PRR提升达6%，建立了VLM不确定性估计的新SOTA。

Conclusion: 联合利用模型内部视觉理解的信念和生成的标记概率可以显著提升不确定性估计性能，超越仅依赖单一组件的方法。

Abstract: The growing deployment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in high-stakes
applications such as autonomous driving and assistive technologies for visually
impaired individuals necessitates reliable mechanisms to assess the
trustworthiness of their generation. Uncertainty Estimation (UE) plays a
central role in quantifying the reliability of model outputs and reducing
unsafe generations via selective prediction. In this regard, most existing
probability-based UE approaches rely on output probability distributions,
aggregating token probabilities into a single uncertainty score using
predefined functions such as length-normalization. Another line of research
leverages model hidden representations and trains MLP-based models to predict
uncertainty. However, these methods often fail to capture the complex
multimodal relationships between semantic and textual tokens and struggle to
identify biased probabilities often influenced by language priors. Motivated by
these observations, we propose a novel UE framework, HARMONY, that jointly
leverages fused multimodal information in model activations and the output
distribution of the VLM to determine the reliability of responses. The key
hypothesis of our work is that both the model's internal belief in its visual
understanding, captured by its hidden representations, and the produced token
probabilities carry valuable reliability signals that can be jointly leveraged
to improve UE performance, surpassing approaches that rely on only one of these
components. Experimental results on three open-ended VQA benchmarks, A-OKVQA,
VizWiz, and PathVQA, and three state-of-the-art VLMs, LLaVa-7b, LLaVA-13b and
InstructBLIP demonstrate that our method consistently performs on par with or
better than existing approaches, achieving up to 4\% improvement in AUROC, and
6\% in PRR, establishing new state of the art in uncertainty estimation for
VLMs.

Motivation: 尽管图像生成模型在规模和逼真度上取得进展，但其机制仍不透明。目标是剥离复杂的工程技巧，探索自然图像的最小理论结构

Method: 基于自然图像的空间非平稳性、低层规律性和高层语义性三个原则，从局部上下文窗口定义每个像素的分布，构建非参数生成模型

Result: 在MNIST上生成高保真样本，在CIFAR-10上生成视觉上引人注目的图像，尽管架构简单且无需训练

Conclusion: 这种简单性和强经验性能的结合指向自然图像结构的最小理论，模型的白盒性质提供了对泛化和多样化图像生成的机制理解

Abstract: Scaling and architectural advances have produced strikingly photorealistic
image generative models, yet their mechanisms still remain opaque. Rather than
advancing scaling, our goal is to strip away complicated engineering tricks and
propose a simple, non-parametric generative model. Our design is grounded in
three principles of natural images-(i) spatial non-stationarity, (ii) low-level
regularities, and (iii) high-level semantics-and defines each pixel's
distribution from its local context window. Despite its minimal architecture
and no training, the model produces high-fidelity samples on MNIST and visually
compelling CIFAR-10 images. This combination of simplicity and strong empirical
performance points toward a minimal theory of natural-image structure. The
model's white-box nature also allows us to have a mechanistic understanding of
how the model generalizes and generates diverse images. We study it by tracing
each generated pixel back to its source images. These analyses reveal a simple,
compositional procedure for "part-whole generalization", suggesting a
hypothesis for how large neural network generative models learn to generalize.

Conclusion: MOGRAS数据集和所提方法为更真实的人-场景交互铺平了道路。

Abstract: Generating realistic full-body motion interacting with objects is critical
for applications in robotics, virtual reality, and human-computer interaction.
While existing methods can generate full-body motion within 3D scenes, they
often lack the fidelity for fine-grained tasks like object grasping.
Conversely, methods that generate precise grasping motions typically ignore the
surrounding 3D scene. This gap, generating full-body grasping motions that are
physically plausible within a 3D scene, remains a significant challenge. To
address this, we introduce MOGRAS (Human MOtion with GRAsping in 3D Scenes), a
large-scale dataset that bridges this gap. MOGRAS provides pre-grasping
full-body walking motions and final grasping poses within richly annotated 3D
indoor scenes. We leverage MOGRAS to benchmark existing full-body grasping
methods and demonstrate their limitations in scene-aware generation.
Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method to adapt existing
approaches to work seamlessly within 3D scenes. Through extensive quantitative
and qualitative experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our dataset and
highlight the significant improvements our proposed method achieves, paving the
way for more realistic human-scene interactions.

Motivation: 随着建筑行业对更快、更安全、更高效流程的需求增长，场外建筑带来了新的安全风险，需要预测工人轨迹并考虑社会和环境因素来开发防撞系统。传统方法难以适应动态和不可预测的建筑环境，而现有数据驱动方法在捕捉长期行为和空间社会背景方面仍有挑战。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架和模型在建筑工地轨迹预测方面表现出色，能够有效捕捉时空交互，为防撞系统开发提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: As the demand grows within the construction industry for processes that are
not only faster but also safer and more efficient, offsite construction has
emerged as a solution, though it brings new safety risks due to the close
interaction between workers, machinery, and moving obstacles. Predicting the
future trajectories of workers and taking into account social and environmental
factors is a crucial step for developing collision-avoidance systems to
mitigate such risks. Traditional methods often struggle to adapt to the dynamic
and unpredictable nature of construction environments. Many rely on simplified
assumptions or require hand-crafted features, limiting their ability to respond
to complex, real-time interactions between workers and moving obstacles. While
recent data-driven methods have improved the modeling of temporal patterns,
they still face challenges in capturing long-term behavior and accounting for
the spatial and social context crucial to collision risk assessment. To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a framework integrating YOLOv10n and
DeepSORT for precise detection and tracking, along with two novel trajectory
prediction models: TrajGATFormer and TrajGATFormer-Obstacle. YOLOv10n serves as
the backbone for object detection, accurately identifying workers and obstacles
in diverse scenes, while DeepSORT efficiently tracks them over time with unique
IDs for continuity. Both models employ a transformer encoder-decoder with Graph
Attention Networks (GAT) to capture temporal and spatial interactions.
TrajGATFormer predicts worker trajectories with an ADE of 1.25 m and FDE of 2.3
m over a 4.8 s horizon, while TrajGATFormer-Obstacle extends prediction to both
workers and obstacles, achieving higher accuracy (ADE 1.15 m, FDE 2.2 m).
Comparative analysis shows both models outperform traditional methods, reducing
ADE and FDE by up to 35% and 38%, respectively.

Abstract: Generating dynamic and interactive 3D objects, such as trees, has wide
applications in virtual reality, games, and world simulation. Nevertheless,
existing methods still face various challenges in generating realistic 4D
motion for complex real trees. In this paper, we propose DynamicTree, the first
framework that can generate long-term, interactive animation of 3D Gaussian
Splatting trees. Unlike prior optimization-based methods, our approach
generates dynamics in a fast feed-forward manner. The key success of our
approach is the use of a compact sparse voxel spectrum to represent the tree
movement. Given a 3D tree from Gaussian Splatting reconstruction, our pipeline
first generates mesh motion using the sparse voxel spectrum and then binds
Gaussians to deform the mesh. Additionally, the proposed sparse voxel spectrum
can also serve as a basis for fast modal analysis under external forces,
allowing real-time interactive responses. To train our model, we also introduce
4DTree, the first large-scale synthetic 4D tree dataset containing 8,786
animated tree meshes with semantic labels and 100-frame motion sequences.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves realistic and
responsive tree animations, significantly outperforming existing approaches in
both visual quality and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) provides an effective way to tackle target-domain
tasks by leveraging knowledge learned from source domains. Recent studies have
extended this paradigm to Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA), which exploits
multiple source domains carrying richer and more diverse transferable
information. However, a substantial performance gap still remains between
adaptation-based methods and fully supervised learning. In this paper, we
explore a more practical and challenging setting, named Multi-Source Active
Domain Adaptation (MS-ADA), to further enhance target-domain performance by
selectively acquiring annotations from the target domain. The key difficulty of
MS-ADA lies in designing selection criteria that can jointly handle inter-class
diversity and multi-source domain variation. To address these challenges, we
propose a simple yet effective GALA strategy (GALA), which combines a global
k-means clustering step for target-domain samples with a cluster-wise local
selection criterion, effectively tackling the above two issues in a
complementary manner. Our proposed GALA is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing DA frameworks without introducing any additional
trainable parameters. Extensive experiments on three standard DA benchmarks
demonstrate that GALA consistently outperforms prior active learning and active
DA methods, achieving performance comparable to the fully-supervised upperbound
while using only 1% of the target annotations.

Result: 大量实验验证了UniPAN的有效性，显著提升了深度图像融合模型在不同卫星传感器上的性能。

Conclusion: UniPAN通过统一的分布策略有效增强了深度学习模型的泛化能力，解决了遥感图像融合中的跨传感器适应问题。

Abstract: Existing deep learning-based models for remote sensing pansharpening exhibit
exceptional performance on training datasets. However, due to sensor-specific
characteristics and varying imaging conditions, these models suffer from
substantial performance degradation when applied to unseen satellite data,
lacking generalizability and thus limiting their applicability. We argue that
the performance drops stem primarily from distributional discrepancies from
different sources and the key to addressing this challenge lies in bridging the
gap between training and testing distributions. To validate the idea and
further achieve a "train once, deploy forever" capability, this paper
introduces a novel and intuitive approach to enpower any pansharpening models
with generalizability by employing a unified distribution strategy (UniPAN).
Specifically, we construct a distribution transformation function that
normalizes the pixels sampled from different sources to conform to an identical
distribution. The deep models are trained on the transformed domain, and during
testing on new datasets, the new data are also transformed to match the
training distribution. UniPAN aims to train and test the model on a unified and
consistent distribution, thereby enhancing its generalizability. Extensive
experiments validate the efficacy of UniPAN, demonstrating its potential to
significantly enhance the performance of deep pansharpening models across
diverse satellite sensors. Codes: https://github.com/yc-cui/UniPAN.

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段主动学习方法，使用扩散模型提取多尺度特征，通过分层候选选择和熵增强分歧评分来在极低标注预算下实现语义分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义分割需要密集的像素级标注，成本高昂，特别是在标注预算极度受限的情况下，需要开发高效的主动学习方法。

Method: 两阶段选择流程：第一阶段使用预训练扩散模型提取多尺度特征，通过MaxHerding选择代表性像素并构建多样化全局池；第二阶段计算熵增强分歧评分(eDALD)来选择最具信息量的像素进行标注。

Result: 在四个基准数据集(CamVid、ADE-Bed、Cityscapes、Pascal-Context)上的实验表明，该方法在极端像素预算条件下显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过解耦多样性和不确定性，该方法能够在仅使用极少标注像素的情况下实现高精度的语义分割。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation demands dense pixel-level annotations, which can be
prohibitively expensive - especially under extremely constrained labeling
budgets. In this paper, we address the problem of low-budget active learning
for semantic segmentation by proposing a novel two-stage selection pipeline.
Our approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model to extract rich
multi-scale features that capture both global structure and fine details. In
the first stage, we perform a hierarchical, representation-based candidate
selection by first choosing a small subset of representative pixels per image
using MaxHerding, and then refining these into a diverse global pool. In the
second stage, we compute an entropy-augmented disagreement score (eDALD) over
noisy multi-scale diffusion features to capture both epistemic uncertainty and
prediction confidence, selecting the most informative pixels for annotation.
This decoupling of diversity and uncertainty lets us achieve high segmentation
accuracy with only a tiny fraction of labeled pixels. Extensive experiments on
four benchmarks (CamVid, ADE-Bed, Cityscapes, and Pascal-Context) demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines under extreme
pixel-budget regimes. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统车道检测方法在特征表示和检测性能方面存在局限，需要一种能够处理噪声并提升特征质量的新方法。

Method: 采用高斯噪声添加到真实车道参数获得噪声锚点，设计混合解码策略结合全局和局部解码器，并使用辅助头增强编码器特征表示。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上表现优异，在Carlane上超越现有方法至少1%准确率，在CULane、Tusimple和LLAMAS上分别达到81.32%、96.89%和97.59%的指标。

Conclusion: DiffusionLane具有较强的泛化能力和有前景的检测性能，在车道检测任务中优于现有最先进方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel diffusion-based model for lane detection,
called DiffusionLane, which treats the lane detection task as a denoising
diffusion process in the parameter space of the lane. Firstly, we add the
Gaussian noise to the parameters (the starting point and the angle) of ground
truth lanes to obtain noisy lane anchors, and the model learns to refine the
noisy lane anchors in a progressive way to obtain the target lanes. Secondly,
we propose a hybrid decoding strategy to address the poor feature
representation of the encoder, resulting from the noisy lane anchors.
Specifically, we design a hybrid diffusion decoder to combine global-level and
local-level decoders for high-quality lane anchors. Then, to improve the
feature representation of the encoder, we employ an auxiliary head in the
training stage to adopt the learnable lane anchors for enriching the
supervision on the encoder. Experimental results on four benchmarks, Carlane,
Tusimple, CULane, and LLAMAS, show that DiffusionLane possesses a strong
generalization ability and promising detection performance compared to the
previous state-of-the-art methods. For example, DiffusionLane with ResNet18
surpasses the existing methods by at least 1\% accuracy on the domain
adaptation dataset Carlane. Besides, DiffusionLane with MobileNetV4 gets
81.32\% F1 score on CULane, 96.89\% accuracy on Tusimple with ResNet34, and
97.59\% F1 score on LLAMAS with ResNet101. Code will be available at

Abstract: Semantic segmentation has emerged as a fundamental problem in computer
vision, gaining particular importance in real-time applications such as
autonomous driving. The main challenge is achieving high accuracy while
operating under computational and hardware constraints. In this research, we
present an FPGA-based implementation of real-time semantic segmentation
leveraging the lightweight LMIINet architecture and the Coarse-Grained
Reconfigurable Array for Machine Learning (CGRA4ML) hardware framework. The
model was trained using Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) with 8-bit precision
on the Cityscapes dataset, reducing memory footprint by a factor of four while
enabling efficient fixed-point computations. Necessary modifications were
applied to adapt the model to CGRA4ML constraints, including simplifying skip
connections, employing hardware-friendly operations such as depthwise-separable
and 1A-1 convolutions, and redesigning parts of the Flatten Transformer. Our
implementation achieves approximately 90% pixel accuracy and 45% mean
Intersection-over-Union (mIoU), operating in real-time at 20 frames per second
(FPS) with 50.1 ms latency on the ZCU104 FPGA board. The results demonstrate
the potential of CGRA4ML, with its flexibility in mapping modern layers and
off-chip memory utilization for skip connections, provides a path for
implementing advanced semantic segmentation networks on FPGA for real-time
applications to outperform traditional GPU solutions in terms of power
efficiency while maintaining competitive accuracy. The code for this project is

Method: 使用片段级编码器联合建模时空动态，以及基于Transformer的时间解码器，通过专用时间查询同时预测所有未来时间范围的事故分数。

Result: 在现实误报率约束下，该方法在召回率和事故时间预测方面均取得优越性能。

Conclusion: 提出的新范式通过直接预测未来事故分数和精细化评估协议，显著提升了事故预测的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Accident anticipation aims to predict potential collisions in an online
manner, enabling timely alerts to enhance road safety. Existing methods
typically predict frame-level risk scores as indicators of hazard. However,
these approaches rely on ambiguous binary supervision (labeling all frames in
accident videos as positive) despite the fact that risk varies continuously
over time, leading to unreliable learning and false alarms. To address this, we
propose a novel paradigm that shifts the prediction target from current-frame
risk scoring to directly estimating accident scores at multiple future time
steps (e.g., 0.1s-2.0s ahead), leveraging precisely annotated accident
timestamps as supervision. Our method employs a snippet-level encoder to
jointly model spatial and temporal dynamics, and a Transformer-based temporal
decoder that predicts accident scores for all future horizons simultaneously
using dedicated temporal queries. Furthermore, we introduce a refined
evaluation protocol that reports Time-to-Accident (TTA) and recall (evaluated
at multiple pre-accident intervals (0.5s, 1.0s, and 1.5s)) only when the false
alarm rate (FAR) remains within an acceptable range, ensuring practical
relevance. Experiments show that our method achieves superior performance in
both recall and TTA under realistic FAR constraints.

Conclusion: GSAlign通过联合处理几何和语义对齐，有效解决了空中-地面行人重识别中的视角差异和遮挡问题，显著提升了匹配性能。

Abstract: Aerial-Ground person re-identification (AG-ReID) is an emerging yet
challenging task that aims to match pedestrian images captured from drastically
different viewpoints, typically from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and
ground-based surveillance cameras. The task poses significant challenges due to
extreme viewpoint discrepancies, occlusions, and domain gaps between aerial and
ground imagery. While prior works have made progress by learning cross-view
representations, they remain limited in handling severe pose variations and
spatial misalignment. To address these issues, we propose a Geometric and
Semantic Alignment Network (GSAlign) tailored for AG-ReID. GSAlign introduces
two key components to jointly tackle geometric distortion and semantic
misalignment in aerial-ground matching: a Learnable Thin Plate Spline (LTPS)
Module and a Dynamic Alignment Module (DAM). The LTPS module adaptively warps
pedestrian features based on a set of learned keypoints, effectively
compensating for geometric variations caused by extreme viewpoint changes. In
parallel, the DAM estimates visibility-aware representation masks that
highlight visible body regions at the semantic level, thereby alleviating the
negative impact of occlusions and partial observations in cross-view
correspondence. A comprehensive evaluation on CARGO with four matching
protocols demonstrates the effectiveness of GSAlign, achieving significant
improvements of +18.8\% in mAP and +16.8\% in Rank-1 accuracy over previous
state-of-the-art methods on the aerial-ground setting. The code is available

Abstract: Large-scale and high-quality image-text pair datasets play an important role
in developing high-performing Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we
introduce WAON, a large-scale and high-quality Japanese image-text pair dataset
containing approximately 155 million examples, collected from Common Crawl. Our

Abstract: Harnessing publicly available, large-scale web data, such as street view and
satellite imagery, urban socio-economic sensing is of paramount importance for
achieving global sustainable development goals. With the emergence of Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), new opportunities have arisen to solve this
task by treating it as a multi-modal perception and understanding problem.
However, recent studies reveal that LVLMs still struggle with accurate and
interpretable socio-economic predictions from visual data. To address these
limitations and maximize the potential of LVLMs, we introduce
\textbf{CityRiSE}, a novel framework for \textbf{R}eason\textbf{i}ng urban
\textbf{S}ocio-\textbf{E}conomic status in LVLMs through pure reinforcement
learning (RL). With carefully curated multi-modal data and verifiable reward
design, our approach guides the LVLM to focus on semantically meaningful visual
cues, enabling structured and goal-oriented reasoning for generalist
socio-economic status prediction. Experiments demonstrate that CityRiSE with
emergent reasoning process significantly outperforms existing baselines,
improving both prediction accuracy and generalization across diverse urban
contexts, particularly for prediction on unseen cities and unseen indicators.
This work highlights the promise of combining RL and LVLMs for interpretable

Result: 在多个扩散骨干模型（SD3.5M、Flux.1-dev）和多样化代理任务上的实验表明，GRPO-Guard显著减少了过优化，同时保持甚至提高了生成质量。

Conclusion: GRPO-Guard通过稳定重要性比率分布和均衡梯度更新，有效缓解了隐式过优化问题，无需依赖繁重的KL正则化，提升了GRPO强化学习框架的实用性。

Abstract: Recently, GRPO-based reinforcement learning has shown remarkable progress in
optimizing flow-matching models, effectively improving their alignment with
task-specific rewards. Within these frameworks, the policy update relies on
importance-ratio clipping to constrain overconfident positive and negative
gradients. However, in practice, we observe a systematic shift in the
importance-ratio distribution-its mean falls below 1 and its variance differs
substantially across timesteps. This left-shifted and inconsistent distribution
prevents positive-advantage samples from entering the clipped region, causing
the mechanism to fail in constraining overconfident positive updates. As a
result, the policy model inevitably enters an implicit over-optimization
stage-while the proxy reward continues to increase, essential metrics such as
image quality and text-prompt alignment deteriorate sharply, ultimately making
the learned policy impractical for real-world use. To address this issue, we
introduce GRPO-Guard, a simple yet effective enhancement to existing GRPO
frameworks. Our method incorporates ratio normalization, which restores a
balanced and step-consistent importance ratio, ensuring that PPO clipping
properly constrains harmful updates across denoising timesteps. In addition, a
gradient reweighting strategy equalizes policy gradients over noise conditions,
preventing excessive updates from particular timestep regions. Together, these
designs act as a regulated clipping mechanism, stabilizing optimization and
substantially mitigating implicit over-optimization without relying on heavy KL
regularization. Extensive experiments on multiple diffusion backbones (e.g.,
SD3.5M, Flux.1-dev) and diverse proxy tasks demonstrate that GRPO-Guard
significantly reduces over-optimization while maintaining or even improving
generation quality.

Conclusion: 基于图的机制在自监督表示学习中非常有效，能够显著提升模型性能，证明了捕获实例间关系的重要性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates graph theory into
self-supervised representation learning. Traditional methods focus on
intra-instance variations generated by applying augmentations. However, they
often overlook important inter-instance relationships. While our method retains
the intra-instance property, it further captures inter-instance relationships
by constructing k-nearest neighbor (KNN) graphs for both teacher and student
streams during pretraining. In these graphs, nodes represent samples along with
their latent representations. Edges encode the similarity between instances.
Following pretraining, a representation refinement phase is performed. In this
phase, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate messages not only among immediate
neighbors but also across multiple hops, thereby enabling broader contextual
integration. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K
demonstrate accuracy improvements of 7.3%, 3.2%, and 1.0%, respectively, over
state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness of the
proposed graph based mechanism. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有基于扩散的方法通常将fMRI活动映射到单一高层嵌入，并在整个生成过程中将其作为固定引导。这种固定引导会压缩分层神经信息，且与图像重建的阶段需求不匹配。

Method: 提出MindHier框架，包含三个组件：分层fMRI编码器提取多级神经嵌入、层次到层次对齐方案与CLIP特征建立层间对应关系、尺度感知的从粗到细神经引导策略在匹配尺度注入嵌入到自回归中。

Result: 在NSD数据集上的广泛实验表明，MindHier相比基于扩散的基线方法实现了更优的语义保真度、4.67倍的推理速度提升和更确定性的结果。

Conclusion: MindHier通过分层重建过程（先合成全局语义再细化局部细节）提供了一个高效且认知对齐的替代方案，类似于人类视觉感知过程。

Abstract: Reconstructing visual stimuli from fMRI signals is a central challenge
bridging machine learning and neuroscience. Recent diffusion-based methods
typically map fMRI activity to a single high-level embedding, using it as fixed
guidance throughout the entire generation process. However, this fixed guidance
collapses hierarchical neural information and is misaligned with the
stage-dependent demands of image reconstruction. In response, we propose
MindHier, a coarse-to-fine fMRI-to-image reconstruction framework built on
scale-wise autoregressive modeling. MindHier introduces three components: a
Hierarchical fMRI Encoder to extract multi-level neural embeddings, a
Hierarchy-to-Hierarchy Alignment scheme to enforce layer-wise correspondence
with CLIP features, and a Scale-Aware Coarse-to-Fine Neural Guidance strategy
to inject these embeddings into autoregression at matching scales. These
designs make MindHier an efficient and cognitively-aligned alternative to
diffusion-based methods by enabling a hierarchical reconstruction process that
synthesizes global semantics before refining local details, akin to human
visual perception. Extensive experiments on the NSD dataset show that MindHier
achieves superior semantic fidelity, 4.67x faster inference, and more
deterministic results than the diffusion-based baselines.

Conclusion: GeoDiffusion框架能够实现跨多种设计工作流程的精确几何修改，为工程和创意产业提供有效的几何控制解决方案。

Abstract: Precise geometric control in image generation is essential for engineering \&
product design and creative industries to control 3D object features accurately
in image space. Traditional 3D editing approaches are time-consuming and demand
specialized skills, while current image-based generative methods lack accuracy
in geometric conditioning. To address these challenges, we propose
GeoDiffusion, a training-free framework for accurate and efficient geometric
conditioning of 3D features in image generation. GeoDiffusion employs a
class-specific 3D object as a geometric prior to define keypoints and
parametric correlations in 3D space. We ensure viewpoint consistency through a
rendered image of a reference 3D object, followed by style transfer to meet
user-defined appearance specifications. At the core of our framework is
GeoDrag, improving accuracy and speed of drag-based image editing on geometry
guidance tasks and general instructions on DragBench. Our results demonstrate
that GeoDiffusion enables precise geometric modifications across various
iterative design workflows.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种将内参估计集成到自监督单目深度估计框架中的方法，通过改进Depth Anything V2模型来联合预测深度、姿态和内参参数，在SCARED和C3VD数据集上表现出色。


<details>

Motivation: 内窥镜手术场景的3D重建对于增强场景感知、实现AR可视化和支持图像引导手术中的上下文感知决策至关重要。然而，在真实手术环境中，由于无菌约束和使用具有连续变焦和望远镜旋转功能的专用内窥镜，内参标定面临挑战。现有方法大多不估计内参参数，限制了准确可靠重建的效果。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将内参估计集成到自监督深度估计框架中，解决了内窥镜手术场景中内参标定的关键挑战，为准确可靠的3D重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of endoscopic surgery scenes plays a vital role in
enhancing scene perception, enabling AR visualization, and supporting
context-aware decision-making in image-guided surgery. A critical yet
challenging step in this process is the accurate estimation of the endoscope's
intrinsic parameters. In real surgical settings, intrinsic calibration is
hindered by sterility constraints and the use of specialized endoscopes with
continuous zoom and telescope rotation. Most existing methods for endoscopic 3D
reconstruction do not estimate intrinsic parameters, limiting their
effectiveness for accurate and reliable reconstruction. In this paper, we
integrate intrinsic parameter estimation into a self-supervised monocular depth
estimation framework by adapting the Depth Anything V2 (DA2) model for joint
depth, pose, and intrinsics prediction. We introduce an attention-based pose
network and a Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) strategy for
efficient fine-tuning of DA2. Our method is validated on the SCARED and C3VD
public datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to recent
state-of-the-art approaches in self-supervised monocular depth estimation and
3D reconstruction. Code and model weights can be found in project repository:

TL;DR: T2SMark提出了一种基于尾部截断采样的两阶段水印方案，解决了现有噪声水印方法在鲁棒性和生成多样性之间的平衡问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有噪声水印方法难以平衡水印鲁棒性和生成多样性，一些方法通过严格约束初始噪声采样获得强鲁棒性但损害用户体验，而其他方法保持多样性但鲁棒性不足。

Method: 采用尾部截断采样技术，仅在可靠的尾部区域嵌入水印位，同时在中心区域随机采样以保持潜在分布；使用两阶段框架，通过随机生成的会话密钥集成到两个加密流程中确保采样多样性。

Result: 在U-Net和DiT骨干的扩散模型上评估，T2SMark在鲁棒性和多样性之间实现了最佳平衡。

Conclusion: T2SMark通过创新的尾部截断采样和两阶段框架，有效解决了噪声水印方法中鲁棒性与多样性的权衡问题。

Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced rapidly in recent years, producing
high-fidelity images while raising concerns about intellectual property
protection and the misuse of generative AI. Image watermarking for diffusion
models, particularly Noise-as-Watermark (NaW) methods, encode watermark as
specific standard Gaussian noise vector for image generation, embedding the
infomation seamlessly while maintaining image quality. For detection, the
generation process is inverted to recover the initial noise vector containing
the watermark before extraction. However, existing NaW methods struggle to
balance watermark robustness with generation diversity. Some methods achieve
strong robustness by heavily constraining initial noise sampling, which
degrades user experience, while others preserve diversity but prove too fragile
for real-world deployment. To address this issue, we propose T2SMark, a
two-stage watermarking scheme based on Tail-Truncated Sampling (TTS). Unlike
prior methods that simply map bits to positive or negative values, TTS enhances
robustness by embedding bits exclusively in the reliable tail regions while
randomly sampling the central zone to preserve the latent distribution. Our
two-stage framework then ensures sampling diversity by integrating a randomly
generated session key into both encryption pipelines. We evaluate T2SMark on
diffusion models with both U-Net and DiT backbones. Extensive experiments show
that it achieves an optimal balance between robustness and diversity. Our code

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于循环相关的可变形图像配准框架，通过动态重定位匹配区域来高效处理大变形，在保持高精度的同时显著降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决可变形图像配准中卷积网络难以处理大变形的问题，特别是体素到区域匹配方法虽然高效但受限于局部性，无法捕捉长距离对应关系。

Method: 使用循环相关框架，在每一步进行低成本局部匹配，利用估计的偏移量指导下一个搜索区域，结合轻量级循环更新模块和解耦运动与纹理特征。

Result: 在脑部MRI和腹部CT数据集上进行了广泛实验，无论是否进行仿射预配准，该方法都表现出优异的精度-计算权衡，在OASIS数据集上仅使用9.5%的FLOPs且运行速度快96%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过动态重定位匹配区域有效解决了大变形配准问题，在保持高精度的同时显著提升了计算效率，为医学图像配准提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Deformable image registration estimates voxel-wise correspondences between
images through spatial transformations, and plays a key role in medical
imaging. While deep learning methods have significantly reduced runtime,
efficiently handling large deformations remains a challenging task.
Convolutional networks aggregate local features but lack direct modeling of
voxel correspondences, promoting recent works to explore explicit feature
matching. Among them, voxel-to-region matching is more efficient for direct
correspondence modeling by computing local correlation features whithin
neighbourhoods, while region-to-region matching incurs higher redundancy due to
excessive correlation pairs across large regions. However, the inherent
locality of voxel-to-region matching hinders the capture of long-range
correspondences required for large deformations. To address this, we propose a
Recurrent Correlation-based framework that dynamically relocates the matching
region toward more promising positions. At each step, local matching is
performed with low cost, and the estimated offset guides the next search
region, supporting efficient convergence toward large deformations. In
addition, we uses a lightweight recurrent update module with memory capacity
and decouples motion-related and texture features to suppress semantic
redundancy. We conduct extensive experiments on brain MRI and abdominal CT
datasets under two settings: with and without affine pre-registration. Results
show that our method exibits a strong accuracy-computation trade-off,
surpassing or matching the state-of-the-art performance. For example, it
achieves comparable performance on the non-affine OASIS dataset, while using
only 9.5% of the FLOPs and running 96% faster than RDP, a representative
high-performing method.

Abstract: We present a fully interpretable and flexible statistical method for
background subtraction in roadside LiDAR data, aimed at enhancing
infrastructure-based perception in automated driving. Our approach introduces
both a Gaussian distribution grid (GDG), which models the spatial statistics of

this representation to classify LiDAR points as foreground or background. The
method supports diverse LiDAR types, including multiline 360 degree and
micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) sensors, and adapts to various
configurations. Evaluated on the publicly available RCooper dataset, it
outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in accuracy and flexibility, even with

*Jusheng Zhang,Kaitong Cai,Jing Yang,Jian Wang,Chengpei Tang,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Top-Down Semantic Refinement (TDSR)框架，将图像描述重新定义为分层规划问题，通过高效的MCTS算法显著减少对大型视觉语言模型的调用频率，同时提升描述质量和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在图像描述中存在矛盾：强大的单步生成能力导致决策短视，难以在保持全局叙事连贯性的同时捕捉丰富细节，特别是在需要多步骤和复杂场景描述的任务中。

Method: 将图像描述建模为马尔可夫决策过程，提出TDSR框架，采用专为VLMs设计的高效蒙特卡洛树搜索算法，包含视觉引导并行扩展和轻量级价值网络，并引入自适应早停机制。

Result: 在DetailCaps、COMPOSITIONCAP和POPE等多个基准测试中，TDSR作为即插即用模块显著提升了现有VLMs（如LLaVA-1.5、Qwen2.5-VL）的性能，在细粒度描述、组合泛化和幻觉抑制方面达到最先进或极具竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: TDSR框架通过分层规划方法有效解决了VLMs在图像描述中的全局连贯性与细节丰富性之间的矛盾，以更低的计算成本实现了更高质量的图像描述。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face an inherent contradiction in image
captioning: their powerful single-step generation capabilities often lead to a
myopic decision-making process. This makes it difficult to maintain global
narrative coherence while capturing rich details, a limitation that is
particularly pronounced in tasks that require multi-step and complex scene
description. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we redefine image
captioning as a goal-oriented hierarchical refinement planning problem, and
further propose a novel framework, named Top-Down Semantic Refinement (TDSR),
which models the generation process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).
However, planning within the vast state space of a VLM presents a significant
computational hurdle. Our core contribution, therefore, is the design of a
highly efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm tailored for VLMs. By
incorporating a visual-guided parallel expansion and a lightweight value
network, our TDSR reduces the call frequency to the expensive VLM by an order
of magnitude without sacrificing planning quality. Furthermore, an adaptive
early stopping mechanism dynamically matches computational overhead to the
image's complexity. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including
DetailCaps, COMPOSITIONCAP, and POPE, demonstrate that our TDSR, as a
plug-and-play module, can significantly enhance the performance of existing
VLMs (e.g., LLaVA-1.5, Qwen2.5-VL) by achieving state-of-the-art or highly
competitive results in fine-grained description, compositional generalization,
and hallucination suppression.

Abstract: Because 3D structure of a roadway environment can be characterized directly
by a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors, they can be used to obtain
exceptional situational awareness for assitive and autonomous driving systems.
Although LiDARs demonstrate good performance in clean and clear weather
conditions, their performance significantly deteriorates in adverse weather
conditions such as those involving atmospheric precipitation. This may render
perception capabilities of autonomous systems that use LiDAR data in learning
based models to perform object detection and ranging ineffective. While efforts
have been made to enhance the accuracy of these models, the extent of signal
degradation under various weather conditions remains largely not quantified. In
this study, we focus on the performance of an automotive grade LiDAR in snowy
conditions in order to develop a physics-based model that examines failure
modes of a LiDAR sensor. Specifically, we investigated how the LiDAR signal
attenuates with different snowfall rates and how snow particles near the source
serve as small but efficient reflectors. Utilizing our model, we transform data
from clear conditions to simulate snowy scenarios, enabling a comparison of our
synthetic data with actual snowy conditions. Furthermore, we employ this
synthetic data, representative of different snowfall rates, to explore the
impact on a pre-trained object detection model, assessing its performance under
varying levels of snowfall

Motivation: 解决可穿戴辅助代理中的目标推断问题，消除用户与代理交互所需的努力，通过多模态上下文观察来推断用户目标。

Method: 收集包含视觉、音频、数字和纵向上下文观察的多模态数据集，使用多种现代视觉语言模型进行生成式基准测试，并进行模态消融实验。

Result: 人类表现优于模型表现（93% vs 84%），更大模型表现更好但实用性仍有限（仅55%时间产生相关目标），相关模态信息能提升性能而无关模态影响很小。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型在目标推断任务上仍有很大提升空间，需要进一步研究以实现实际应用价值。

Abstract: There has been a surge of interest in assistive wearable agents: agents
embodied in wearable form factors (e.g., smart glasses) who take assistive
actions toward a user's goal/query (e.g. "Where did I leave my keys?"). In this
work, we consider the important complementary problem of inferring that goal
from multi-modal contextual observations. Solving this "goal inference" problem
holds the promise of eliminating the effort needed to interact with such an
agent. This work focuses on creating WAGIBench, a strong benchmark to measure
progress in solving this problem using vision-language models (VLMs). Given the
limited prior work in this area, we collected a novel dataset comprising 29
hours of multimodal data from 348 participants across 3,477 recordings,
featuring ground-truth goals alongside accompanying visual, audio, digital, and
longitudinal contextual observations. We validate that human performance
exceeds model performance, achieving 93% multiple-choice accuracy compared with
84% for the best-performing VLM. Generative benchmark results that evaluate
several families of modern vision-language models show that larger models
perform significantly better on the task, yet remain far from practical
usefulness, as they produce relevant goals only 55% of the time. Through a
modality ablation, we show that models benefit from extra information in
relevant modalities with minimal performance degradation from irrelevant
modalities.

Conclusion: 该半监督框架有效利用了未标记的冷冻电子断层扫描数据，显著提升了粒子检测性能，为解决该领域的数据标注瓶颈提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Cryogenic Electron Tomography (CryoET) combined with sub-volume averaging
(SVA) is the only imaging modality capable of resolving protein structures
inside cells at molecular resolution. Particle picking, the task of localizing
and classifying target proteins in 3D CryoET volumes, remains the main
bottleneck. Due to the reliance on time-consuming manual labels, the vast
reserve of unlabeled tomograms remains underutilized. In this work, we present
a fast, label-efficient semi-supervised framework that exploits this untapped
data. Our framework consists of two components: (i) an end-to-end
heatmap-supervised detection model inspired by keypoint detection, and (ii) a
teacher-student co-training mechanism that enhances performance under sparse
labeling conditions. Furthermore, we introduce multi-view pseudo-labeling and a
CryoET-specific DropBlock augmentation strategy to further boost performance.
Extensive evaluations on the large-scale CZII dataset show that our approach
improves F1 by 10% over supervised baselines, underscoring the promise of
semi-supervised learning for leveraging unlabeled CryoET data.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 2D and 3D generative models have expanded the
capabilities of computer vision. However, generating high-quality 4D dynamic
content from a single static image remains a significant challenge. Traditional
methods have limitations in modeling temporal dependencies and accurately
capturing dynamic geometry changes, especially when considering variations in
camera perspective. To address this issue, we propose DynaPose4D, an innovative
solution that integrates 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) techniques with
Category-Agnostic Pose Estimation (CAPE) technology. This framework uses 3D
Gaussian Splatting to construct a 3D model from single images, then predicts
multi-view pose keypoints based on one-shot support from a chosen view,
leveraging supervisory signals to enhance motion consistency. Experimental
results show that DynaPose4D achieves excellent coherence, consistency, and
fluidity in dynamic motion generation. These findings not only validate the
efficacy of the DynaPose4D framework but also indicate its potential
applications in the domains of computer vision and animation production.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) aims to train a lightweight student model by
transferring knowledge from a large, high-capacity teacher. Recent studies have
shown that leveraging diverse teacher perspectives can significantly improve
distillation performance; however, achieving such diversity typically requires
multiple teacher networks, leading to high computational costs. In this work,
we propose a novel cost-efficient knowledge augmentation method for KD that
generates diverse multi-views by attaching multiple branches to a single
teacher. To ensure meaningful semantic variation across multi-views, we
introduce two angular diversity objectives: 1) constrained inter-angle
diversify loss, which maximizes angles between augmented views while preserving
proximity to the original teacher output, and 2) intra-angle diversify loss,
which encourages an even distribution of views around the original output. The
ensembled knowledge from these angularly diverse views, along with the original
teacher, is distilled into the student. We further theoretically demonstrate
that our objectives increase the diversity among ensemble members and thereby
reduce the upper bound of the ensemble's expected loss, leading to more
effective distillation. Experimental results show that our method surpasses an
existing knowledge augmentation method across diverse configurations. Moreover,
the proposed method is compatible with other KD frameworks in a plug-and-play
fashion, providing consistent improvements in generalization performance.

TL;DR: 提出GateFuseNet，一种自适应3D多模态融合网络，通过门控融合模块整合QSM和T1w MRI图像，用于帕金森病诊断，在准确率和AUC方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于幅度的MRI模态（如T1w）对帕金森病病理敏感性不足，而定量磁化率成像（QSM）能更好量化深部灰质核团中的铁沉积，但现有方法未能充分利用这两种模态的优势。

Method: 开发了门控融合模块，学习模态特定的注意力权重和通道级门控向量，进行选择性特征调制。这种分层门控机制增强ROI感知特征，同时抑制不相关信号。

Result: 方法在准确率（85.00%）和AUC（92.06%）方面优于三种现有最先进方法。消融研究验证了ROI引导、多模态集成和融合定位的贡献。

Conclusion: GateFuseNet通过自适应多模态融合有效提升了帕金森病的MRI诊断性能，Grad-CAM可视化证实模型聚焦于临床相关病理区域。

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) from MRI remains challenging
due to symptom variability and pathological heterogeneity. Most existing
methods rely on conventional magnitude-based MRI modalities, such as
T1-weighted images (T1w), which are less sensitive to PD pathology than
Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM), a phase-based MRI technique that
quantifies iron deposition in deep gray matter nuclei. In this study, we
propose GateFuseNet, an adaptive 3D multimodal fusion network that integrates
QSM and T1w images for PD diagnosis. The core innovation lies in a gated fusion
module that learns modality-specific attention weights and channel-wise gating
vectors for selective feature modulation. This hierarchical gating mechanism
enhances ROI-aware features while suppressing irrelevant signals. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms three existing state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving 85.00% accuracy and 92.06% AUC. Ablation studies further
validate the contributions of ROI guidance, multimodal integration, and fusion
positioning. Grad-CAM visualizations confirm the model's focus on clinically
relevant pathological regions. The source codes and pretrained models can be

Conclusion: ORIG展示了开放多模态检索在事实图像生成方面的潜力，为解决多模态模型的事实矛盾问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
generating photorealistic and prompt-aligned images, but they often produce
outputs that contradict verifiable knowledge, especially when prompts involve
fine-grained attributes or time-sensitive events. Conventional
retrieval-augmented approaches attempt to address this issue by introducing
external information, yet they are fundamentally incapable of grounding
generation in accurate and evolving knowledge due to their reliance on static
sources and shallow evidence integration. To bridge this gap, we introduce
ORIG, an agentic open multimodal retrieval-augmented framework for Factual
Image Generation (FIG), a new task that requires both visual realism and
factual grounding. ORIG iteratively retrieves and filters multimodal evidence
from the web and incrementally integrates the refined knowledge into enriched
prompts to guide generation. To support systematic evaluation, we build
FIG-Eval, a benchmark spanning ten categories across perceptual, compositional,
and temporal dimensions. Experiments demonstrate that ORIG substantially
improves factual consistency and overall image quality over strong baselines,
highlighting the potential of open multimodal retrieval for factual image
generation.

Result: 广泛实验表明，AesCrop在定量指标和定性评估上均优于现有最先进方法，生成更美观的裁剪结果。

Conclusion: AesCrop通过显式整合构图知识，成功解决了现有方法在全局性和多样性方面的局限，为美学驱动的图像裁剪提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Aesthetic-driven image cropping is crucial for applications like view
recommendation and thumbnail generation, where visual appeal significantly
impacts user engagement. A key factor in visual appeal is composition--the
deliberate arrangement of elements within an image. Some methods have
successfully incorporated compositional knowledge through evaluation-based and
regression-based paradigms. However, evaluation-based methods lack globality
while regression-based methods lack diversity. Recently, hybrid approaches that
integrate both paradigms have emerged, bridging the gap between these two to
achieve better diversity and globality. Notably, existing hybrid methods do not
incorporate photographic composition guidance, a key attribute that defines
photographic aesthetics. In this work, we introduce AesCrop, a
composition-aware hybrid image-cropping model that integrates a VMamba image
encoder, augmented with a novel Mamba Composition Attention Bias (MCAB) and a
transformer decoder to perform end-to-end rank-based image cropping, generating
multiple crops along with the corresponding quality scores. By explicitly
encoding compositional cues into the attention mechanism, MCAB directs AesCrop
to focus on the most compositionally salient regions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that AesCrop outperforms current state-of-the-art methods,
delivering superior quantitative metrics and qualitatively more pleasing crops.

*Xiang Fei,Tina Tian,Howie Choset,Lu Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Bag-of-Word-Groups (BoWG)方法，通过词组捕捉视觉词的空间共现和邻近性构建在线词典，结合时间一致性计算相似度，在感知混淆环境中实现高精度闭环检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在感知混淆环境（如狭窄管道）中因向量量化、特征稀疏和重复纹理而表现不佳，现有解决方案计算成本高。

Method: 引入词组概念构建在线词典，结合概率转移模型的时间一致性自适应方案，配备特征分布分析模块和专用后验证机制。

Result: 在公共数据集和自建管道数据集上超越最先进方法，在Bicocca25b数据集上平均每幅图像处理时间仅16毫秒。

Conclusion: BoWG在精度-召回率和计算效率方面优于传统和基于学习的方法，具有出色的可扩展性。

Abstract: Loop closure is critical in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
systems to reduce accumulative drift and ensure global mapping consistency.
However, conventional methods struggle in perceptually aliased environments,
such as narrow pipes, due to vector quantization, feature sparsity, and
repetitive textures, while existing solutions often incur high computational
costs. This paper presents Bag-of-Word-Groups (BoWG), a novel loop closure
detection method that achieves superior precision-recall, robustness, and
computational efficiency. The core innovation lies in the introduction of word
groups, which captures the spatial co-occurrence and proximity of visual words
to construct an online dictionary. Additionally, drawing inspiration from
probabilistic transition models, we incorporate temporal consistency directly
into similarity computation with an adaptive scheme, substantially improving
precision-recall performance. The method is further strengthened by a feature
distribution analysis module and dedicated post-verification mechanisms. To
evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on both public
datasets and a confined-pipe dataset we constructed. Results demonstrate that
BoWG surpasses state-of-the-art methods, including both traditional and
learning-based approaches, in terms of precision-recall and computational
efficiency. Our approach also exhibits excellent scalability, achieving an
average processing time of 16 ms per image across 17,565 images in the
Bicocca25b dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SRSR框架，通过空间重聚焦交叉注意力(SRCA)和空间定向无分类器引导(STCFG)解决扩散超分辨率中的语义模糊和幻觉问题，在多个数据集上超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的超分辨率方法因文本条件不准确不完整，以及交叉注意力偏向无关像素，导致语义错位和幻觉细节。

Method: 提出SRSR框架：1) SRCA使用视觉分割掩码在推理时精炼文本条件；2) STCFG选择性绕过未接地像素的文本影响以防止幻觉。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，SRSR在PSNR和SSIM指标上全面超越7个基线方法，在真实数据集上的LPIPS和DISTS感知质量指标也表现优异。

Conclusion: SRSR能同时实现高语义保真度和感知质量，有效解决扩散超分辨率中的语义模糊问题。

Abstract: Existing diffusion-based super-resolution approaches often exhibit semantic
ambiguities due to inaccuracies and incompleteness in their text conditioning,
coupled with the inherent tendency for cross-attention to divert towards
irrelevant pixels. These limitations can lead to semantic misalignment and
hallucinated details in the generated high-resolution outputs. To address
these, we propose a novel, plug-and-play spatially re-focused super-resolution
(SRSR) framework that consists of two core components: first, we introduce
Spatially Re-focused Cross-Attention (SRCA), which refines text conditioning at
inference time by applying visually-grounded segmentation masks to guide
cross-attention. Second, we introduce a Spatially Targeted Classifier-Free
Guidance (STCFG) mechanism that selectively bypasses text influences on
ungrounded pixels to prevent hallucinations. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that SRSR consistently
outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines in standard fidelity metrics (PSNR
and SSIM) across all datasets, and in perceptual quality measures (LPIPS and
DISTS) on two real-world benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in
achieving both high semantic fidelity and perceptual quality in
super-resolution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STATUS Bench是首个用于严格评估视觉语言模型理解物体状态变化能力的基准，包含三个任务：物体状态识别、图像检索和状态变化识别。实验表明当前最先进的VLMs在捕捉细微物体状态差异方面仍存在显著困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然现有视觉语言模型能够执行多种多模态任务，但它们在识别物体状态（如位置状态和功能状态）方面的精确度仍不明确，需要专门的基准来评估这种能力。

Method: 提出了STATUS Bench基准，包含三个同时执行的任务：物体状态识别、图像检索和状态变化识别。基于手工制作的图像对数据集，并引入了包含1300万半自动生成描述的STATUS Train训练数据集。

Result: 实验显示，在提出的严格评估方案下，大多数开源VLMs表现出随机水平的零样本性能。在STATUS Train上微调后，Qwen2.5-VL达到了与Gemini 2.0 Flash相当的性能。

Conclusion: 当前最先进的VLMs在捕捉细微物体状态差异方面仍面临挑战，STATUS Bench和Train对于推进VLM研究中物体状态识别的发展是必要的。

Abstract: Object state recognition aims to identify the specific condition of objects,
such as their positional states (e.g., open or closed) and functional states
(e.g., on or off). While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are capable of
performing a variety of multimodal tasks, it remains unclear how precisely they
can identify object states. To alleviate this issue, we introduce the STAte and
Transition UnderStanding Benchmark (STATUS Bench), the first benchmark for
rigorously evaluating the ability of VLMs to understand subtle variations in
object states in diverse situations. Specifically, STATUS Bench introduces a
novel evaluation scheme that requires VLMs to perform three tasks
simultaneously: object state identification (OSI), image retrieval (IR), and
state change identification (SCI). These tasks are defined over our fully
hand-crafted dataset involving image pairs, their corresponding object state
descriptions and state change descriptions. Furthermore, we introduce a
large-scale training dataset, namely STATUS Train, which consists of 13 million
semi-automatically created descriptions. This dataset serves as the largest
resource to facilitate further research in this area. In our experiments, we
demonstrate that STATUS Bench enables rigorous consistency evaluation and
reveal that current state-of-the-art VLMs still significantly struggle to
capture subtle object state distinctions. Surprisingly, under the proposed
rigorous evaluation scheme, most open-weight VLMs exhibited chance-level
zero-shot performance. After fine-tuning on STATUS Train, Qwen2.5-VL achieved
performance comparable to Gemini 2.0 Flash. These findings underscore the
necessity of STATUS Bench and Train for advancing object state recognition in
VLM research.

Motivation: 现有微表情研究主要依赖实验室环境数据集，在真实世界场景中性能急剧下降，需要解决野外对话场景下的微表情分析挑战。

Method: 开发了端到端的定位检测框架MELDAE，引入边界感知损失函数来惩罚起始和结束时间误差，提高时间定位精度。

Result: 在WDMD数据集上达到最先进水平，关键F1_DR定位指标比最强基线提升17.72%，并在现有基准测试中展现出优秀的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了野外场景微表情分析问题，为真实世界情感识别提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately analyzing spontaneous, unconscious micro-expressions is crucial
for revealing true human emotions, but this task remains challenging in wild
scenarios, such as natural conversation. Existing research largely relies on
datasets from controlled laboratory environments, and their performance
degrades dramatically in the real world. To address this issue, we propose
three contributions: the first micro-expression dataset focused on
conversational-in-the-wild scenarios; an end-to-end localization and detection
framework, MELDAE; and a novel boundary-aware loss function that improves
temporal accuracy by penalizing onset and offset errors. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on the WDMD
dataset, improving the key F1_{DR} localization metric by 17.72% over the
strongest baseline, while also demonstrating excellent generalization
capabilities on existing benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决XLFM中基于学习的3D重建面临的两个核心挑战：缺乏标准化数据集和能有效建模角度-空间结构且保持物理基础的方法。

Method: 构建XLFM-Zebrafish基准数据集；提出MVN-LF自监督任务学习角度先验；设计ORC损失函数通过可微分渲染约束确保预测体积与PSF前向投影的一致性。

Result: 在XLFM-Zebrafish基准上，该方法比现有最优基线PSNR提高了7.7%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过标准化数据集、自监督学习和物理约束的有效结合，显著提升了XLFM的3D重建性能。

Abstract: Light field microscopy (LFM) has become an emerging tool in neuroscience for
large-scale neural imaging in vivo, notable for its single-exposure volumetric
imaging, broad field of view, and high temporal resolution. However,
learning-based 3D reconstruction in XLFM remains underdeveloped due to two core
challenges: the absence of standardized datasets and the lack of methods that
can efficiently model its angular-spatial structure while remaining physically
grounded. We address these challenges by introducing three key contributions.
First, we construct the XLFM-Zebrafish benchmark, a large-scale dataset and
evaluation suite for XLFM reconstruction. Second, we propose Masked View
Modeling for Light Fields (MVN-LF), a self-supervised task that learns angular
priors by predicting occluded views, improving data efficiency. Third, we
formulate the Optical Rendering Consistency Loss (ORC Loss), a differentiable
rendering constraint that enforces alignment between predicted volumes and
their PSF-based forward projections. On the XLFM-Zebrafish benchmark, our
method improves PSNR by 7.7% over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: PFED在精度和效率方面均达到最先进水平，证明了其在实时无人机应用中的实际可行性。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) enables UAV localization by matching
aerial images to geo-tagged satellite databases, which is critical for
autonomous navigation in GNSS-denied environments. However, existing methods
rely on resource-intensive fine-grained feature extraction and alignment, where
multiple branches and modules significantly increase inference costs, limiting
their deployment on edge devices. We propose Precision-Focused Efficient Design
(PFED), a resource-efficient framework combining hierarchical knowledge
transfer and multi-view representation refinement. This innovative method
comprises two key components: 1) During training, Hierarchical Distillation
paradigm for fast and accurate CVGL (HD-CVGL), coupled with Uncertainty-Aware
Prediction Alignment (UAPA) to distill essential information and mitigate the
data imbalance without incurring additional inference overhead. 2) During
inference, an efficient Multi-view Refinement Module (MRM) leverages mutual
information to filter redundant samples and effectively utilize the multi-view
data. Extensive experiments show that PFED achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both accuracy and efficiency, reaching 97.15\% Recall@1 on
University-1652 while being over $5 \times$ more efficient in FLOPs and $3
\times$ faster than previous top methods. Furthermore, PFED runs at 251.5 FPS
on the AGX Orin edge device, demonstrating its practical viability for
real-time UAV applications. The project is available at

TL;DR: PSScreen V2是一个部分监督的自训练框架，用于多种视网膜疾病筛查。它通过三分支架构（一个教师网络和两个学生网络）处理多源部分标注数据集中的标签缺失和域偏移问题，采用低频特征增强策略提升域泛化能力。

Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖全标注或单域数据集的局限性，处理多源部分标注数据集中同时存在的标签缺失和域偏移挑战。

Method: 采用三分支架构：教师分支从弱增强图像生成伪标签处理缺失标签；两个学生分支分别使用低频丢弃（LF-Dropout）增强域鲁棒性，以及低频不确定性（LF-Uncert）通过对抗学习的高斯扰动估计域变异性。

Conclusion: PSScreen V2是一个通用且适应性强的框架，能够有效处理多源部分标注数据，在视网膜疾病筛查任务中表现出色，具有良好的推广潜力。

Abstract: In this work, we propose PSScreen V2, a partially supervised self-training
framework for multiple retinal disease screening. Unlike previous methods that
rely on fully labelled or single-domain datasets, PSScreen V2 is designed to
learn from multiple partially labelled datasets with different distributions,
addressing both label absence and domain shift challenges. To this end,
PSScreen V2 adopts a three-branch architecture with one teacher and two student
networks. The teacher branch generates pseudo labels from weakly augmented
images to address missing labels, while the two student branches introduce
novel feature augmentation strategies: Low-Frequency Dropout (LF-Dropout),
which enhances domain robustness by randomly discarding domain-related
low-frequency components, and Low-Frequency Uncertainty (LF-Uncert), which
estimates uncertain domain variability via adversarially learned Gaussian
perturbations of low-frequency statistics. Extensive experiments on multiple
in-domain and out-of-domain fundus datasets demonstrate that PSScreen V2
achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior domain generalization
ability. Furthermore, compatibility tests with diverse backbones, including the
vision foundation model DINOv2, as well as evaluations on chest X-ray datasets,
highlight the universality and adaptability of the proposed framework. The

TL;DR: 提出了一种投影嵌入扩散桥模型，通过引入新的反向随机微分方程，在采样过程中同时考虑FBP重建和投影数据，从而自然地融入数据一致性约束，在三种不完整CT数据重建任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决不完整投影数据CT重建的挑战性问题，现有扩散桥模型缺乏对数据一致性的有效整合，而数据一致性可以提升重建保真度和细节恢复能力。

Method: 提出投影嵌入扩散桥模型，设计新的反向随机微分方程，将投影数据嵌入到分数函数中，推导后验分数的可处理表达式，引入随机性控制参数，并设计离散化方案减少误差。

Result: 在稀疏视图、有限角度和截断投影三种不完整数据类型的CT重建中，PEDB在标准、噪声和域偏移评估中都优于现有最先进的扩散桥模型。

Conclusion: PEDB通过显式地将投影数据条件化到采样过程中，成功实现了数据一致性约束，在不完整CT数据重建任务中取得了优异性能。

Abstract: Reconstructing CT images from incomplete projection data remains challenging
due to the ill-posed nature of the problem. Diffusion bridge models have
recently shown promise in restoring clean images from their corresponding
Filtered Back Projection (FBP) reconstructions, but incorporating data
consistency into these models remains largely underexplored. Incorporating data
consistency can improve reconstruction fidelity by aligning the reconstructed
image with the observed projection data, and can enhance detail recovery by
integrating structural information contained in the projections. In this work,
we propose the Projection Embedded Diffusion Bridge (PEDB). PEDB introduces a
novel reverse stochastic differential equation (SDE) to sample from the
distribution of clean images conditioned on both the FBP reconstruction and the
incomplete projection data. By explicitly conditioning on the projection data
in sampling the clean images, PEDB naturally incorporates data consistency. We
embed the projection data into the score function of the reverse SDE. Under
certain assumptions, we derive a tractable expression for the posterior score.
In addition, we introduce a free parameter to control the level of
stochasticity in the reverse process. We also design a discretization scheme
for the reverse SDE to mitigate discretization error. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PEDB achieves strong performance in CT reconstruction from
three types of incomplete data, including sparse-view, limited-angle, and
truncated projections. For each of these types, PEDB outperforms evaluated
state-of-the-art diffusion bridge models across standard, noisy, and
domain-shift evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用小波变换的稀疏、分布式和多尺度表示特性，通过自监督学习挖掘高光谱图像中的潜在对称性，解决传统方法对地面真值的依赖问题。

Method: 三阶段架构：SWANencoder将小波系数映射到低维潜在空间，SWANdecoder重建输入小波系数，SWANforward学习高光谱图像的物理特性。使用三阶段组合损失函数和Adam优化器。

Result: 在合成和真实高光谱数据集上的实验表明，该方法在定性和定量评估中优于现有最先进的神经网络解混方法，并具有更好的鲁棒性和实用性。

Conclusion: SWAN通过学习弹性解混函数、促进自监督和紧凑网络参数，实现了性能提升，为实际应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this article, we present SWAN: a three-stage, self-supervised wavelet
neural network for joint estimation of endmembers and abundances from
hyperspectral imagery. The contiguous and overlapping hyperspectral band images
are first expanded to Biorthogonal wavelet basis space that provides sparse,
distributed, and multi-scale representations. The idea is to exploit latent
symmetries from thus obtained invariant and covariant features using a
self-supervised learning paradigm. The first stage, SWANencoder maps the input
wavelet coefficients to a compact lower-dimensional latent space. The second
stage, SWANdecoder uses the derived latent representation to reconstruct the
input wavelet coefficients. Interestingly, the third stage SWANforward learns
the underlying physics of the hyperspectral image. A three-stage combined loss
function is formulated in the image acquisition domain that eliminates the need
for ground truth and enables self-supervised training. Adam is employed for
optimizing the proposed loss function, while Sigmoid with a dropout of 0.3 is
incorporated to avoid possible overfitting. Kernel regularizers bound the
magnitudes and preserve spatial variations in the estimated endmember
coefficients. The output of SWANencoder represents estimated abundance maps
during inference, while weights of SWANdecoder are retrieved to extract
endmembers. Experiments are conducted on two benchmark synthetic data sets with
different signal-to-noise ratios as well as on three real benchmark
hyperspectral data sets while comparing the results with several
state-of-the-art neural network-based unmixing methods. The qualitative,
quantitative, and ablation results show performance enhancement by learning a
resilient unmixing function as well as promoting self-supervision and compact
network parameters for practical applications.

Motivation: 解决畜牧业中缺乏大规模标注数据集的问题，探索利用合成数据训练的模型进行跨物种迁移学习的可行性，以促进农业AI应用。

Method: 使用ZebraPose（基于视觉变换器的模型，在合成斑马图像上训练）进行27个关键点检测，在三个数据集配置上评估：自定义农场数据集、APT-36K基准子集及其组合。

Result: 组合模型在分布内数据上表现良好（AP=0.86，AR=0.87，PCK 0.5=0.869），但在未见牛舍和牛群中泛化失败严重，暴露了合成到真实的域差距问题。

Conclusion: 形态相似性不足以实现跨域迁移，需要农业优先的AI设计，强调农场级真实性、跨环境鲁棒性和开放基准数据集。

Abstract: Pose estimation serves as a cornerstone of computer vision for understanding
animal posture, behavior, and welfare. Yet, agricultural applications remain
constrained by the scarcity of large, annotated datasets for livestock,
especially dairy cattle. This study evaluates the potential and limitations of
cross-species transfer learning by adapting ZebraPose - a vision
transformer-based model trained on synthetic zebra imagery - for 27-keypoint
detection in dairy cows under real barn conditions. Using three configurations
- a custom on-farm dataset (375 images, Sussex, New Brunswick, Canada), a
subset of the APT-36K benchmark dataset, and their combination, we
systematically assessed model accuracy and generalization across environments.
While the combined model achieved promising performance (AP = 0.86, AR = 0.87,
PCK 0.5 = 0.869) on in-distribution data, substantial generalization failures
occurred when applied to unseen barns and cow populations. These findings
expose the synthetic-to-real domain gap as a major obstacle to agricultural AI
deployment and emphasize that morphological similarity between species is
insufficient for cross-domain transfer. The study provides practical insights
into dataset diversity, environmental variability, and computational
constraints that influence real-world deployment of livestock monitoring
systems. We conclude with a call for agriculture-first AI design, prioritizing
farm-level realism, cross-environment robustness, and open benchmark datasets
to advance trustworthy and scalable animal-centric technologies.

model demonstrates strong generalization under scanner and staining shifts,
achieving balanced accuracy 85.0%, AUROC 0.927, sensitivity 89.2%, and
specificity 80.9% on the official test set. These results indicate that
combining DenseNet-121 with stain-aware augmentation and imbalance-adaptive

*Tharun Anand,Mohammad Hassan Vali,Arno Solin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种直接从预训练扩散模型参数中推导语义编辑方向的解析方法，无需额外数据或微调，通过计算自注意力权重矩阵的特征向量获得可解释的编辑方向，编辑时间减少60%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像合成中表现出色，但对其输出进行精确控制和目标编辑仍然具有挑战性。现有方法通常依赖大量图像采样或训练辅助网络，效率有限。

Method: 通过分析扩散模型中自注意力权重矩阵的特征向量，直接从预训练参数中提取语义编辑方向，无需额外数据或模型微调。

Result: 实验表明该方法在多个数据集上产生高质量的编辑效果，同时编辑时间相比当前基准方法显著减少60%。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、无需额外训练的可解释编辑方向发现方法，显著提升了扩散模型编辑的效率和可控性。

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve remarkable fidelity in image synthesis, yet precise
control over their outputs for targeted editing remains challenging. A key step
toward controllability is to identify interpretable directions in the model's
latent representations that correspond to semantic attributes. Existing
approaches for finding interpretable directions typically rely on sampling
large sets of images or training auxiliary networks, which limits efficiency.
We propose an analytical method that derives semantic editing directions
directly from the pretrained parameters of diffusion models, requiring neither
additional data nor fine-tuning. Our insight is that self-attention weight
matrices encode rich structural information about the data distribution learned
during training. By computing the eigenvectors of these weight matrices, we
obtain robust and interpretable editing directions. Experiments demonstrate
that our method produces high-quality edits across multiple datasets while
reducing editing time significantly by 60% over current benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了SARCLIP，首个针对SAR领域的视觉语言基础模型，通过构建包含100万文本-图像对的大规模数据集SARCLIP-1M，采用对比学习实现SAR图像与文本的对齐，在图像-文本检索和零样本分类任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SAR基础模型主要关注低层视觉特征，忽视了多模态对齐和零样本目标识别能力。需要构建能够连接SAR图像与文本语义的视觉语言模型。

Method: 构建SARCLIP-1M大规模数据集，采用对比视觉语言学习方法，通过领域迁移策略训练SARCLIP模型，实现SAR图像与文本描述的语义对齐。

Result: 在图像-文本检索和零样本分类任务中，SARCLIP显著优于现有最先进的基础模型，在特征提取和图像解释方面表现出色。

Conclusion: SARCLIP模型推进了SAR图像的语义理解能力，为SAR领域提供了首个有效的视觉语言基础模型，代码和数据集将开源。

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has emerged as a crucial imaging modality due
to its all-weather capabilities. While recent advancements in self-supervised
learning and Masked Image Modeling (MIM) have paved the way for SAR foundation
models, these approaches primarily focus on low-level visual features, often
overlooking multimodal alignment and zero-shot target recognition within SAR
imagery. To address this limitation, we construct SARCLIP-1M, a large-scale
vision language dataset comprising over one million text-image pairs aggregated
from existing datasets. We further introduce SARCLIP, the first vision language
foundation model tailored for the SAR domain. Our SARCLIP model is trained
using a contrastive vision language learning approach by domain transferring
strategy, enabling it to bridge the gap between SAR imagery and textual
descriptions. Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval and zero-shot
classification tasks demonstrate the superior performance of SARCLIP in feature
extraction and interpretation, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art
foundation models and advancing the semantic understanding of SAR imagery. The
code and datasets will be released soon.

TL;DR: 提出LVD-GS系统，结合LiDAR和视觉的3D高斯泼溅SLAM，通过分层协作表示模块和联合动态建模模块解决大规模动态室外场景中的尺度漂移和动态物体问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅SLAM方法在单一表示方案下，难以应对大规模动态室外场景，导致累积位姿误差和尺度模糊问题。

Method: 1. 分层协作表示模块：模仿人类思维链过程，促进映射优化的相互增强；2. 联合动态建模模块：融合开放世界分割与隐式残差约束，基于DINO-Depth特征的不确定性估计生成细粒度动态掩码。

Conclusion: LVD-GS系统通过LiDAR-视觉融合和创新的动态建模方法，有效解决了大规模动态室外场景中SLAM的挑战，实现了鲁棒的重建效果。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM has emerged as a widely used technique for
high-fidelity mapping in spatial intelligence. However, existing methods often
rely on a single representation scheme, which limits their performance in
large-scale dynamic outdoor scenes and leads to cumulative pose errors and
scale ambiguity. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{LVD-GS}, a
novel LiDAR-Visual 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM system. Motivated by the human
chain-of-thought process for information seeking, we introduce a hierarchical
collaborative representation module that facilitates mutual reinforcement for
mapping optimization, effectively mitigating scale drift and enhancing
reconstruction robustness. Furthermore, to effectively eliminate the influence
of dynamic objects, we propose a joint dynamic modeling module that generates
fine-grained dynamic masks by fusing open-world segmentation with implicit
residual constraints, guided by uncertainty estimates from DINO-Depth features.
Extensive evaluations on KITTI, nuScenes, and self-collected datasets
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to
existing methods.

### [231] [Alias-Free ViT: Fractional Shift Invariance via Linear Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22673)
*Hagay Michaeli,Daniel Soudry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Alias-Free ViT模型，通过消除混叠效应和采用线性交叉协方差注意力机制，使Vision Transformer具有平移不变性，在图像分类任务中保持竞争力，并在对抗性平移鲁棒性方面优于同类模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers缺乏卷积网络的架构归纳偏置，对图像平移更敏感。虽然卷积网络也因下采样和非线性层的混叠效应而不完全平移不变，但已有抗混叠方法提升其平移鲁棒性。本文旨在为ViT开发类似的平移不变性增强方法。

Method: 结合两个主要组件：1）使用无混叠下采样和非线性操作；2）采用线性交叉协方差注意力机制，该机制对整数和分数平移都具有平移等变性，从而获得平移不变的全局表示。

Result: 模型在图像分类任务中保持竞争力，在对抗性平移鲁棒性方面优于相似规模的模型。

Conclusion: 通过消除混叠效应和设计平移等变的注意力机制，可以显著提升Vision Transformers的平移不变性，同时保持其性能优势。

Abstract: Transformers have emerged as a competitive alternative to convnets in vision
tasks, yet they lack the architectural inductive bias of convnets, which may
hinder their potential performance. Specifically, Vision Transformers (ViTs)
are not translation-invariant and are more sensitive to minor image
translations than standard convnets. Previous studies have shown, however, that
convnets are also not perfectly shift-invariant, due to aliasing in
downsampling and nonlinear layers. Consequently, anti-aliasing approaches have
been proposed to certify convnets' translation robustness. Building on this
line of work, we propose an Alias-Free ViT, which combines two main components.
First, it uses alias-free downsampling and nonlinearities. Second, it uses
linear cross-covariance attention that is shift-equivariant to both integer and
fractional translations, enabling a shift-invariant global representation. Our
model maintains competitive performance in image classification and outperforms
similar-sized models in terms of robustness to adversarial translations.

TL;DR: 提出DAMap方法解决高精地图预测中的任务对齐问题，通过距离感知焦点损失、混合损失方案和任务调制可变形注意力来提升分类和定位质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前高精地图预测方法在高质量预测方面表现不佳，主要由于任务不对齐问题：1）一对多匹配查询共享相同标签导致不合适的任务标签；2）任务共享采样机制导致次优任务特征

Method: DAMap包含三个组件：距离感知焦点损失（DAFL）为样本分配适当分类标签，任务调制可变形注意力（TMDA）获取判别性任务特定特征，混合损失方案（HLS）更好利用DAFL优势

Result: 在NuScenes和Argoverse2基准测试中，在不同指标、基线、分割、主干网络和训练计划下均实现性能提升

Conclusion: DAMap通过解决任务对齐问题，有效提升了高精地图元素预测的质量，为自动驾驶安全提供了更可靠的解决方案

Abstract: Predicting High-definition (HD) map elements with high quality (high
classification and localization scores) is crucial to the safety of autonomous
driving vehicles. However, current methods perform poorly in high quality
predictions due to inherent task misalignment. Two main factors are responsible
for misalignment: 1) inappropriate task labels due to one-to-many matching
queries sharing the same labels, and 2) sub-optimal task features due to
task-shared sampling mechanism. In this paper, we reveal two inherent defects
in current methods and develop a novel HD map construction method named DAMap
to address these problems. Specifically, DAMap consists of three components:
Distance-aware Focal Loss (DAFL), Hybrid Loss Scheme (HLS), and Task Modulated
Deformable Attention (TMDA). The DAFL is introduced to assign appropriate
classification labels for one-to-many matching samples. The TMDA is proposed to
obtain discriminative task-specific features. Furthermore, the HLS is proposed
to better utilize the advantages of the DAFL. We perform extensive experiments
and consistently achieve performance improvement on the NuScenes and Argoverse2
benchmarks under different metrics, baselines, splits, backbones, and
schedules. Code will be available at https://github.com/jpdong-xjtu/DAMap.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日本二手房市场中建筑物关键元数据（如建造年份、结构类型）经常缺失或过时，影响灾害风险评估和保险定价。

Method: 使用多任务学习模型从立面图像联合估计建造年份、建筑结构和物业类型，然后基于官方保险标准通过规则映射推导结构防火等级。

Result: 模型在建造年份回归和类别不平衡分类中取得高准确率，定性分析显示模型能捕捉与建筑年龄和材料相关的视觉线索。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了基于图像的可扩展、可解释风险分析系统的可行性，在保险、城市规划和灾害准备方面具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Structural fireproof classification is vital for disaster risk assessment and
insurance pricing in Japan. However, key building metadata such as construction
year and structure type are often missing or outdated, particularly in the
second-hand housing market. This study proposes a multi-task learning model
that predicts these attributes from facade images. The model jointly estimates
the construction year, building structure, and property type, from which the
structural fireproof class - defined as H (non-fireproof), T (semi-fireproof),
or M (fireproof) - is derived via a rule-based mapping based on official
insurance criteria. We trained and evaluated the model using a large-scale
dataset of Japanese residential images, applying rigorous filtering and
deduplication. The model achieved high accuracy in construction-year regression
and robust classification across imbalanced categories. Qualitative analyses
show that it captures visual cues related to building age and materials. Our
approach demonstrates the feasibility of scalable, interpretable, image-based
risk-profiling systems, offering potential applications in insurance, urban
planning, and disaster preparedness.

Motivation: SVG在数字设计和机器人控制中具有基础性作用，不仅编码视觉结构，还编码交互式绘图中的运动路径。现有方法在生成高质量、符合查询的SVG方面存在局限性。

Method: 构建了RoboDraw数据集（100万个样本），开发了RoboSVG框架，包含多模态指导生成、候选SVG合成和数值指导精炼三个步骤。支持文本到SVG、图像到SVG、部分SVG到SVG和部分图像到SVG四种任务。

Conclusion: RoboSVG为交互式SVG生成提供了一个有效的统一框架，数据集和源代码将公开发布。

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are fundamental to digital design and robot
control, encoding not only visual structure but also motion paths in
interactive drawings. In this work, we introduce RoboSVG, a unified multimodal
framework for generating interactive SVGs guided by textual, visual, and
numerical signals. Given an input query, the RoboSVG model first produces
multimodal guidance, then synthesizes candidate SVGs through dedicated
generation modules, and finally refines them under numerical guidance to yield
high-quality outputs. To support this framework, we construct RoboDraw, a
large-scale dataset of one million examples, each pairing an SVG generation
condition (e.g., text, image, and partial SVG) with its corresponding
ground-truth SVG code. RoboDraw dataset enables systematic study of four tasks,
including basic generation (Text-to-SVG, Image-to-SVG) and interactive
generation (PartialSVG-to-SVG, PartialImage-to-SVG). Extensive experiments
demonstrate that RoboSVG achieves superior query compliance and visual fidelity
across tasks, establishing a new state of the art in versatile SVG generation.
The dataset and source code of this project will be publicly available soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MRAG方法存在静态检索策略、不灵活的模态选择和次优的信息利用问题，导致确定何时检索、选择什么模态以及如何有效利用检索信息这三个关键挑战

Method: 引入Windsock模块进行检索必要性和模态选择的决策，提出DANCE指令调优增强MLLMs利用检索信息的能力，采用自评估方法将问答数据集转换为MRAG训练数据集

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升生成质量17.07%，同时减少8.95%的检索次数

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效解决了MRAG中的关键挑战，在提升响应质量的同时降低了计算开销

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) has emerged as a promising
method to generate factual and up-to-date responses of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating non-parametric knowledge from external
knowledge bases. However, existing MRAG approaches suffer from static retrieval
strategies, inflexible modality selection, and suboptimal utilization of
retrieved information, leading to three critical challenges: determining when
to retrieve, what modality to incorporate, and how to utilize retrieved
information effectively. To address these challenges, we introduce Windsock, a
query-dependent module making decisions on retrieval necessity and modality
selection, effectively reducing computational overhead and improving response
quality. Additionally, we propose Dynamic Noise-Resistance (DANCE) Instruction
Tuning, an adaptive training strategy that enhances MLLMs' ability to utilize
retrieved information while maintaining robustness against noise. Moreover, we
adopt a self-assessment approach leveraging knowledge within MLLMs to convert
question-answering datasets to MRAG training datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the generation
quality by 17.07% while reducing 8.95% retrieval times.

*Wenlong Li,Yifei Xu,Yuan Rao,Zhenhua Wang,Shuiguang Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VADTree是一种无需训练的视频异常检测方法，通过层次化粒度感知树结构进行灵活采样，利用预训练模型知识检测不同时间跨度的异常事件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法中，监督方法需要大量领域内训练数据且无法提供清晰的异常解释，而无训练方法虽然利用预训练模型知识，但固定长度时间窗口采样难以准确捕捉不同时间跨度的异常。

Method: 使用层次化粒度感知树结构进行灵活采样，基于预训练通用事件边界检测模型识别潜在异常事件边界，将视频分解为通用事件节点，进行自适应粗细层次化结构和冗余移除，构建HGTree，然后向视觉语言模型注入多维先验增强节点级异常感知，通过大语言模型实现通用事件节点的异常推理，最后使用簇间节点关联方法整合多粒度异常分数。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的数据集上的广泛实验表明，VADTree在无训练设置下实现了最先进的性能，同时大幅减少了采样的视频片段数量。

Conclusion: VADTree通过层次化粒度感知树结构和预训练模型知识的有效利用，成功解决了视频异常检测中不同时间跨度异常事件的准确检测问题，在无训练设置下取得了优异性能。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies in videos.
Supervised methods demand substantial in-domain training data and fail to
deliver clear explanations for anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods
leverage the knowledge reserves and language interactivity of large pre-trained
models to detect anomalies. However, the current fixed-length temporal window
sampling approaches struggle to accurately capture anomalies with varying
temporal spans. Therefore, we propose VADTree that utilizes a Hierarchical
Granularityaware Tree (HGTree) structure for flexible sampling in VAD. VADTree
leverages the knowledge embedded in a pre-trained Generic Event Boundary
Detection (GEBD) model to characterize potential anomaly event boundaries.
Specifically, VADTree decomposes the video into generic event nodes based on
boundary confidence, and performs adaptive coarse-fine hierarchical structuring
and redundancy removal to construct the HGTree. Then, the multi-dimensional
priors are injected into the visual language models (VLMs) to enhance the
node-wise anomaly perception, and anomaly reasoning for generic event nodes is
achieved via large language models (LLMs). Finally, an inter-cluster node
correlation method is used to integrate the multi-granularity anomaly scores.
Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate that VADTree
achieves state-of-the-art performance in training-free settings while
drastically reducing the number of sampled video segments. The code will be
available at https://github.com/wenlongli10/VADTree.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在复杂提示词（特别是同一类别多个不同实例）的图像生成上表现不佳，且现有评估方法要么过于简单，要么与人类评估相关性差。

Method: 构建M³T2IBench大规模基准数据集，包含多类别、多实例、多关系场景；提出基于目标检测的AlignScore评估指标；设计Revise-Then-Enforce训练免费后编辑方法。

Result: 当前开源文本到图像模型在该挑战性基准上表现较差；提出的后编辑方法在多种扩散模型中都能显著提升图像-文本对齐效果。

Conclusion: M³T2IBench和AlignScore为复杂文本-图像对齐提供了更好的评估框架，Revise-Then-Enforce方法能有效提升生成图像与文本提示的对齐度。

Abstract: Text-to-image models are known to struggle with generating images that
perfectly align with textual prompts. Several previous studies have focused on
evaluating image-text alignment in text-to-image generation. However, these
evaluations either address overly simple scenarios, especially overlooking the
difficulty of prompts with multiple different instances belonging to the same
category, or they introduce metrics that do not correlate well with human
evaluation. In this study, we introduce M$^3$T2IBench, a large-scale,
multi-category, multi-instance, multi-relation along with an
object-detection-based evaluation metric, $AlignScore$, which aligns closely
with human evaluation. Our findings reveal that current open-source
text-to-image models perform poorly on this challenging benchmark.
Additionally, we propose the Revise-Then-Enforce approach to enhance image-text
alignment. This training-free post-editing method demonstrates improvements in
image-text alignment across a broad range of diffusion models. \footnote{Our
code and data has been released in supplementary material and will be made

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of image generative models, the authenticity of
digital images has become a significant concern. While existing studies have
proposed various methods for detecting AI-generated content, current benchmarks
are limited in their coverage of diverse generative models and image
categories, often overlooking end-to-end image editing and artistic images. To
address these limitations, we introduce UniAIDet, a unified and comprehensive
benchmark that includes both photographic and artistic images. UniAIDet covers
a wide range of generative models, including text-to-image, image-to-image,
image inpainting, image editing, and deepfake models. Using UniAIDet, we
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of various detection methods and answer
three key research questions regarding generalization capability and the
relation between detection and localization. Our benchmark and analysis provide
a robust foundation for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感领域中标注数据稀缺限制了全监督方法的适用性，需要开发自监督学习方法来构建基础模型。

Method: 使用多级离散小波变换分离频率分量，引导编码器学习尺度感知的高频表示；提出地理条件位置编码，通过球谐函数融入地理先验知识。

Result: 在PANGAEA基准测试的多个下游任务中，WaveMAE相比现有方法取得了一致的改进，在分割和回归任务上获得显著提升；轻量级版本仅使用26.4%参数也能达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: WaveMAE被确立为一个强大且具有地理信息感知的多光谱遥感图像基础模型。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently emerged as a key strategy for
building foundation models in remote sensing, where the scarcity of annotated
data limits the applicability of fully supervised approaches. In this work, we
introduce WaveMAE, a masked autoencoding framework tailored for multispectral
satellite imagery. Unlike conventional pixel-based reconstruction, WaveMAE
leverages a multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to disentangle
frequency components and guide the encoder toward learning scale-aware
high-frequency representations. We further propose a Geo-conditioned Positional
Encoding (GPE), which incorporates geographical priors via Spherical Harmonics,
encouraging embeddings that respect both semantic and geospatial structure. To
ensure fairness in evaluation, all methods are pretrained on the same dataset
(fMoW-S2) and systematically evaluated on the diverse downstream tasks of the
PANGAEA benchmark, spanning semantic segmentation, regression, change
detection, and multilabel classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that WaveMAE achieves consistent improvements over prior state-of-the-art
approaches, with substantial gains on segmentation and regression benchmarks.
The effectiveness of WaveMAE pretraining is further demonstrated by showing
that even a lightweight variant, containing only 26.4% of the parameters,
achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our results establish WaveMAE as a
strong and geographically informed foundation model for multispectral remote
sensing imagery.

TL;DR: 提出InstanceGrounded Geometry Transformer (IGGT)，一个端到端的大型统一transformer，将空间重建和实例级上下文理解的知识统一起来。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将3D几何重建和高级空间理解分开处理，忽略了它们之间的关键相互作用，限制了泛化能力和下游3D理解任务的性能。

Method: 设计3D一致性对比学习策略，通过仅使用2D视觉输入指导IGGT编码具有几何结构和实例基础聚类的统一表示。构建InsScene-15K大规模数据集。

Result: 该表示支持将2D视觉输入一致地提升到具有明确不同对象实例的连贯3D场景中。

Conclusion: IGGT通过统一几何结构和语义内容的理解，实现了更连贯和准确的3D场景分析。

Abstract: Humans naturally perceive the geometric structure and semantic content of a
3D world as intertwined dimensions, enabling coherent and accurate
understanding of complex scenes. However, most prior approaches prioritize
training large geometry models for low-level 3D reconstruction and treat
high-level spatial understanding in isolation, overlooking the crucial
interplay between these two fundamental aspects of 3D-scene analysis, thereby
limiting generalization and leading to poor performance in downstream 3D
understanding tasks. Recent attempts have mitigated this issue by simply
aligning 3D models with specific language models, thus restricting perception
to the aligned model's capacity and limiting adaptability to downstream tasks.
In this paper, we propose InstanceGrounded Geometry Transformer (IGGT), an
end-to-end large unified transformer to unify the knowledge for both spatial
reconstruction and instance-level contextual understanding. Specifically, we
design a 3D-Consistent Contrastive Learning strategy that guides IGGT to encode
a unified representation with geometric structures and instance-grounded
clustering through only 2D visual inputs. This representation supports
consistent lifting of 2D visual inputs into a coherent 3D scene with explicitly
distinct object instances. To facilitate this task, we further construct
InsScene-15K, a large-scale dataset with high-quality RGB images, poses, depth
maps, and 3D-consistent instance-level mask annotations with a novel data

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LRW-Persian是最大的波斯语单词级唇读数据集，包含743个目标词和超过414,000个视频样本，为波斯语视觉语音识别提供了基准资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前非英语的视觉语音识别资源有限，特别是波斯语等低资源语言缺乏高质量的唇读数据集，这限制了鲁棒语音识别系统的发展。

Method: 建立了全自动端到端的数据处理流程，包括基于ASR的转录、主动说话者定位、质量过滤和姿态/遮挡筛查，从67个电视节目的1900多小时素材中提取数据。

Result: 构建了包含743个目标词、超过414,000个视频样本的大规模数据集，并对两种广泛使用的唇读架构进行了微调，建立了参考性能基准。

Conclusion: LRW-Persian填补了低资源语言的关键空白，支持严格的基准测试和跨语言迁移，为代表性不足语言环境中的多模态语音研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Lipreading has emerged as an increasingly important research area for
developing robust speech recognition systems and assistive technologies for the
hearing-impaired. However, non-English resources for visual speech recognition
remain limited. We introduce LRW-Persian, the largest in-the-wild Persian
word-level lipreading dataset, comprising $743$ target words and over
$414{,}000$ video samples extracted from more than $1{,}900$ hours of footage
across $67$ television programs. Designed as a benchmark-ready resource,
LRW-Persian provides speaker-disjoint training and test splits, wide regional
and dialectal coverage, and rich per-clip metadata including head pose, age,
and gender. To ensure large-scale data quality, we establish a fully automated
end-to-end curation pipeline encompassing transcription based on Automatic
Speech Recognition(ASR), active-speaker localization, quality filtering, and
pose/mask screening. We further fine-tune two widely used lipreading
architectures on LRW-Persian, establishing reference performance and
demonstrating the difficulty of Persian visual speech recognition. By filling a
critical gap in low-resource languages, LRW-Persian enables rigorous
benchmarking, supports cross-lingual transfer, and provides a foundation for
advancing multimodal speech research in underrepresented linguistic contexts.

Abstract: Cross-view localization and synthesis are two fundamental tasks in cross-view
visual understanding, which deals with cross-view datasets: overhead (satellite
or aerial) and ground-level imagery. These tasks have gained increasing
attention due to their broad applications in autonomous navigation, urban
planning, and augmented reality. Cross-view localization aims to estimate the
geographic position of ground-level images based on information provided by
overhead imagery while cross-view synthesis seeks to generate ground-level
images based on information from the overhead imagery. Both tasks remain
challenging due to significant differences in viewing perspective, resolution,
and occlusion, which are widely embedded in cross-view datasets. Recent years
have witnessed rapid progress driven by the availability of large-scale
datasets and novel approaches. Typically, cross-view localization is formulated
as an image retrieval problem where ground-level features are matched with
tiled overhead images feature, extracted by convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) or vision transformers (ViTs) for cross-view feature embedding.
Cross-view synthesis, on the other hand, seeks to generate ground-level views
based on information from overhead imagery, generally using generative
adversarial networks (GANs) or diffusion models. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey of advances in cross-view localization and synthesis,
reviewing widely used datasets, highlighting key challenges, and providing an
organized overview of state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, it discusses
current limitations, offers comparative analyses, and outlines promising
directions for future research. We also include the project page via

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ConMatFormer混合深度学习架构，结合ConvNeXt块、多种注意力机制和Transformer模块，用于糖尿病足溃疡检测，在准确性和可靠性方面优于现有SOTA模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决糖尿病足溃疡检测中公开数据集稀缺和变异性的挑战，以及类别不平衡问题。

Method: 使用ConvNeXt块提取局部特征，添加Transformer模块增强长距离依赖，结合CBAM和DANet注意力机制，并采用数据增强处理类别不平衡。

Result: 在DFUC2021和DFU数据集上，单实验准确率达0.8961，精确度0.9160；4折交叉验证准确率达0.9755，标准差仅0.0031，显著优于现有CNN和ViT模型。

Conclusion: ConMatFormer为糖尿病足溃疡分类设立了新基准，提供了可解释的混合注意力Transformer框架用于医学图像分析。

Abstract: Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) detection is a clinically significant yet
challenging task due to the scarcity and variability of publicly available
datasets. To solve these problems, we propose ConMatFormer, a new hybrid deep
learning architecture that combines ConvNeXt blocks, multiple attention
mechanisms convolutional block attention module (CBAM) and dual attention
network (DANet), and transformer modules in a way that works together. This
design facilitates the extraction of better local features and understanding of
the global context, which allows us to model small skin patterns across
different types of DFU very accurately. To address the class imbalance, we used
data augmentation methods. A ConvNeXt block was used to obtain detailed local
features in the initial stages. Subsequently, we compiled the model by adding a
transformer module to enhance long-range dependency. This enabled us to
pinpoint the DFU classes that were underrepresented or constituted minorities.
Tests on the DS1 (DFUC2021) and DS2 (diabetic foot ulcer (DFU)) datasets showed
that ConMatFormer outperformed state-of-the-art (SOTA) convolutional neural
network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models in terms of accuracy,
reliability, and flexibility. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of
0.8961 and a precision of 0.9160 in a single experiment, which is a significant
improvement over the current standards for classifying DFUs. In addition, by
4-fold cross-validation, the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 0.9755 with
a standard deviation of only 0.0031. We further applied explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) methods, such as Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and LIME, to
consistently monitor the transparency and trustworthiness of the
decision-making process.. Our findings set a new benchmark for DFU
classification and provide a hybrid attention transformer framework for medical
image analysis.

### [244] [Self-Calibrated Consistency can Fight Back for Adversarial Robustness in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22785)
*Jiaxiang Liu,Jiawei Du,Xiao Liu,Prayag Tiwari,Mingkun Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为自校准一致性（SCC）的测试时防御方法，通过语义一致性和空间一致性模块来增强CLIP模型的零样本对抗鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在零样本场景下表现出色，但对对抗性扰动高度脆弱。现有防御方法依赖带标签数据的对抗微调，限制了在零样本设置中的应用。

Method: SCC包含两个互补模块：语义一致性利用反攻击预热生成的软伪标签和多视图预测来正则化跨模态对齐；空间一致性通过增强视图对齐扰动视觉预测，在对抗扰动下稳定推理。

Result: 在22个基准测试和多种攻击设置下的广泛实验表明，SCC能持续提升CLIP的零样本鲁棒性，同时保持准确性，并可无缝集成到其他视觉语言模型中。

Conclusion: 这项研究展示了从CLIP建立对抗鲁棒范式的巨大潜力，其影响可扩展到更广泛的视觉语言领域，如BioMedCLIP。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated
strong zero-shot capabilities across diverse domains, yet remain highly
vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that disrupt image-text alignment and
compromise reliability. Existing defenses typically rely on adversarial
fine-tuning with labeled data, limiting their applicability in zero-shot
settings. In this work, we identify two key weaknesses of current CLIP
adversarial attacks -- lack of semantic guidance and vulnerability to view
variations -- collectively termed semantic and viewpoint fragility. To address
these challenges, we propose Self-Calibrated Consistency (SCC), an effective
test-time defense. SCC consists of two complementary modules: Semantic
consistency, which leverages soft pseudo-labels from counterattack warm-up and
multi-view predictions to regularize cross-modal alignment and separate the
target embedding from confusable negatives; and Spatial consistency, aligning
perturbed visual predictions via augmented views to stabilize inference under
adversarial perturbations. Together, these modules form a plug-and-play
inference strategy. Extensive experiments on 22 benchmarks under diverse attack
settings show that SCC consistently improves the zero-shot robustness of CLIP
while maintaining accuracy, and can be seamlessly integrated with other VLMs
for further gains. These findings highlight the great potential of establishing
an adversarially robust paradigm from CLIP, with implications extending to
broader vision-language domains such as BioMedCLIP.

TL;DR: MedXplain-VQA是一个可解释的医学视觉问答框架，集成了五个可解释AI组件，在病理VQA任务中显著优于基线方法，提供结构化诊断解释和注意力区域识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学VQA系统需要透明推理才能获得临床信任，现有系统缺乏足够的可解释性来支持医生决策。

Method: 使用微调BLIP-2骨干网络，结合医学查询重构、增强Grad-CAM注意力、精确区域提取和多模态语言模型的链式思维推理。

Result: 在500个PathVQA样本上，综合得分从基线0.378提升至0.683，识别3-5个诊断相关区域，生成平均57词的结构化解释，推理置信度达0.890。

Conclusion: MedXplain-VQA展示了作为稳健可解释医学VQA系统的潜力，查询重构贡献最大改进，链式思维推理实现系统性诊断过程。

Abstract: Explainability is critical for the clinical adoption of medical visual
question answering (VQA) systems, as physicians require transparent reasoning
to trust AI-generated diagnoses. We present MedXplain-VQA, a comprehensive
framework integrating five explainable AI components to deliver interpretable
medical image analysis. The framework leverages a fine-tuned BLIP-2 backbone,
medical query reformulation, enhanced Grad-CAM attention, precise region
extraction, and structured chain-of-thought reasoning via multi-modal language
models. To evaluate the system, we introduce a medical-domain-specific
framework replacing traditional NLP metrics with clinically relevant
assessments, including terminology coverage, clinical structure quality, and
attention region relevance. Experiments on 500 PathVQA histopathology samples
demonstrate substantial improvements, with the enhanced system achieving a
composite score of 0.683 compared to 0.378 for baseline methods, while
maintaining high reasoning confidence (0.890). Our system identifies 3-5
diagnostically relevant regions per sample and generates structured
explanations averaging 57 words with appropriate clinical terminology. Ablation
studies reveal that query reformulation provides the most significant initial
improvement, while chain-of-thought reasoning enables systematic diagnostic
processes. These findings underscore the potential of MedXplain-VQA as a
robust, explainable medical VQA system. Future work will focus on validation
with medical experts and large-scale clinical datasets to ensure clinical
readiness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAGIC-Talk是一个基于扩散模型的单样本音频驱动说话人脸生成框架，通过ReferenceNet保持身份特征和细粒度面部编辑，AnimateNet增强运动连贯性，解决了现有方法在时间一致性、身份保持和长视频生成方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频驱动说话人脸生成方法在音频-嘴唇同步方面有所改进，但在时间一致性、身份保持和定制化方面存在困难，特别是在长视频生成中。

Method: 提出MAGIC-Talk框架，包含ReferenceNet（保持身份特征和通过文本提示进行细粒度面部编辑）和AnimateNet（使用结构化运动先验增强运动连贯性），并引入渐进潜在融合策略来改善长视频质量。

Result: 大量实验表明，MAGIC-Talk在视觉质量、身份保持和同步准确性方面优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MAGIC-Talk为说话人脸生成提供了一个强大的解决方案，能够从单张图像保持身份特征，同时确保帧间平滑过渡。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking face generation has gained significant attention for
applications in digital media and virtual avatars. While recent methods improve
audio-lip synchronization, they often struggle with temporal consistency,
identity preservation, and customization, especially in long video generation.
To address these issues, we propose MAGIC-Talk, a one-shot diffusion-based
framework for customizable and temporally stable talking face generation.
MAGIC-Talk consists of ReferenceNet, which preserves identity and enables
fine-grained facial editing via text prompts, and AnimateNet, which enhances
motion coherence using structured motion priors. Unlike previous methods
requiring multiple reference images or fine-tuning, MAGIC-Talk maintains
identity from a single image while ensuring smooth transitions across frames.
Additionally, a progressive latent fusion strategy is introduced to improve
long-form video quality by reducing motion inconsistencies and flickering.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAGIC-Talk outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in visual quality, identity preservation, and synchronization accuracy,
offering a robust solution for talking face generation.

### [247] [FairJudge: MLLM Judging for Social Attributes and Prompt Image Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22827)
*Zahraa Al Sahili,Maryam Fetanat,Maimuna Nowaz,Ioannis Patras,Matthew Purver*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FairJudge是一个轻量级评估协议，使用多模态LLM作为公平评判者来评估文本到图像系统，通过解释导向的评分标准和证据约束，提供更可靠的社会属性公平性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像系统评估方法（如人脸分类器和对比相似度）存在局限性：依赖表面线索、缺乏校准弃权机制、无法评估弱可见属性（如宗教、文化、残疾），需要更公平可靠的评估方法。

Method: FairJudge协议将指令跟随多模态LLM作为公平评判者，使用映射到[-1,1]的解释导向评分标准，约束判断为封闭标签集，要求证据基于可见内容，并在线索不足时强制弃权。

Result: 在FairFace、PaTA、FairCoT等数据集上评估性别、种族、年龄等属性，并扩展到宗教、文化和残疾。在IdenProf、FairCoT-Professions和新发布的DIVERSIFY-Professions上评估职业正确性和对齐度。评判模型在人口统计预测上优于对比和基于人脸的基线方法。

Conclusion: FairJudge能够实现更可靠、可复现的公平性审计，在多数据集上提高平均对齐度同时保持高职业准确性，为文本到图像系统提供更公平的评估框架。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) systems lack simple, reproducible ways to evaluate how
well images match prompts and how models treat social attributes. Common
proxies -- face classifiers and contrastive similarity -- reward surface cues,
lack calibrated abstention, and miss attributes only weakly visible (for
example, religion, culture, disability). We present FairJudge, a lightweight
protocol that treats instruction-following multimodal LLMs as fair judges. It
scores alignment with an explanation-oriented rubric mapped to [-1, 1];
constrains judgments to a closed label set; requires evidence grounded in the
visible content; and mandates abstention when cues are insufficient. Unlike
CLIP-only pipelines, FairJudge yields accountable, evidence-aware decisions;
unlike mitigation that alters generators, it targets evaluation fairness. We
evaluate gender, race, and age on FairFace, PaTA, and FairCoT; extend to
religion, culture, and disability; and assess profession correctness and
alignment on IdenProf, FairCoT-Professions, and our new DIVERSIFY-Professions.
We also release DIVERSIFY, a 469-image corpus of diverse, non-iconic scenes.
Across datasets, judge models outperform contrastive and face-centric baselines
on demographic prediction and improve mean alignment while maintaining high
profession accuracy, enabling more reliable, reproducible fairness audits.

Motivation: 解决MediaEval 2025竞赛中商业广告记忆性预测任务，旨在开发能够准确预测广告内容记忆度的系统。

Method: 使用Gemma-3 LLM作为主干，集成预计算的视觉(ViT)和文本(E5)特征，通过多模态投影和LoRA适配，并利用LLM生成的基于专家记忆性方面的理性提示来指导融合模型。

Result: 基于LLM的系统在最终测试集上表现出比梯度提升树基线更好的鲁棒性和泛化性能。

Conclusion: 多模态LLM融合系统在广告记忆性预测任务中具有优势，专家指导的理性提示有助于提升模型性能。

Abstract: This paper addresses the prediction of commercial (brand) memorability as
part of "Subtask 2: Commercial/Ad Memorability" within the "Memorability:
Predicting movie and commercial memorability" task at the MediaEval 2025
workshop competition. We propose a multimodal fusion system with a Gemma-3 LLM
backbone that integrates pre-computed visual (ViT) and textual (E5) features by
multi-modal projections. The model is adapted using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).
A heavily-tuned ensemble of gradient boosted trees serves as a baseline. A key
contribution is the use of LLM-generated rationale prompts, grounded in
expert-derived aspects of memorability, to guide the fusion model. The results
demonstrate that the LLM-based system exhibits greater robustness and
generalization performance on the final test set, compared to the baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以有效分离风格与内容，阻碍了跨风格泛化能力，特别是在上下文学习中。

Method: SP-CSVR包含跨风格特征编码器(CSFE)用于风格-内容解耦、语义对齐上下文解码器(SAICD)用于少样本风格适应、自适应语义一致性模块(ASCM)通过多任务对比学习强制跨风格语义不变性。

Result: 在多风格数据集上的实验表明，SP-CSVR在视觉描述、视觉问答和上下文风格适应方面达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SP-CSVR有效提升了跨视觉风格的鲁棒性、泛化能力和效率。

Abstract: The "style trap" poses a significant challenge for Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs), hindering robust semantic understanding across diverse visual
styles, especially in in-context learning (ICL). Existing methods often fail to
effectively decouple style from content, hindering generalization. To address
this, we propose the Semantic-Preserving Cross-Style Visual Reasoner (SP-CSVR),
a novel framework for stable semantic understanding and adaptive cross-style
visual reasoning. SP-CSVR integrates a Cross-Style Feature Encoder (CSFE) for
style-content disentanglement, a Semantic-Aligned In-Context Decoder (SAICD)
for efficient few-shot style adaptation, and an Adaptive Semantic Consistency
Module (ASCM) employing multi-task contrastive learning to enforce cross-style
semantic invariance. Extensive experiments on a challenging multi-style dataset
demonstrate SP-CSVR's state-of-the-art performance across visual captioning,
visual question answering, and in-context style adaptation. Comprehensive
evaluations, including ablation studies and generalization analysis, confirm
SP-CSVR's efficacy in enhancing robustness, generalization, and efficiency
across diverse visual styles.

TL;DR: FastJAM是一种快速的基于图的联合图像对齐方法，通过图神经网络和逆组合损失，在几秒内完成图像对齐，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联合图像对齐方法需要长时间训练、大容量模型和大量超参数调优，计算复杂度高。

Method: 利用现成图像匹配器计算成对匹配，通过快速非参数聚类构建图表示关键点关系，使用图神经网络传播和聚合对应关系，通过图像级池化预测单应性参数，采用逆组合损失消除正则化项需求。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，FastJAM在几秒内完成对齐，比现有方法获得更好的对齐质量，计算时间从小时/分钟级减少到秒级。

Conclusion: FastJAM提供了一种快速有效的联合图像对齐解决方案，显著降低了计算复杂度，无需超参数调优，在质量和效率上都优于现有方法。

Abstract: Joint Alignment (JA) of images aims to align a collection of images into a
unified coordinate frame, such that semantically-similar features appear at
corresponding spatial locations. Most existing approaches often require long
training times, large-capacity models, and extensive hyperparameter tuning. We
introduce FastJAM, a rapid, graph-based method that drastically reduces the
computational complexity of joint alignment tasks. FastJAM leverages pairwise
matches computed by an off-the-shelf image matcher, together with a rapid
nonparametric clustering, to construct a graph representing intra- and
inter-image keypoint relations. A graph neural network propagates and
aggregates these correspondences, efficiently predicting per-image homography
parameters via image-level pooling. Utilizing an inverse-compositional loss,
that eliminates the need for a regularization term over the predicted
transformations (and thus also obviates the hyperparameter tuning associated
with such terms), FastJAM performs image JA quickly and effectively.
Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that FastJAM achieves
results better than existing modern JA methods in terms of alignment quality,
while reducing computation time from hours or minutes to mere seconds. Our code
is available at our project webpage, https://bgu-cs-vil.github.io/FastJAM/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型的概念擦除方法往往损害生成质量，需要一种既能有效擦除有害内容又能保持图像质量的新方法。

Method: 在扩散过程前对文本嵌入进行操作，动态估计目标概念存在性并进行校准的向量减法，包含共现编码模块和视觉反馈循环来处理多概念擦除和潜在概念持续性问题。

Result: 在物体、显式内容、艺术风格和多名人擦除任务中显著优于现有方法，达到93.58 H-score的物体擦除效果，显式内容减少到仅1例，风格擦除H_a为8.09且无质量下降。

Conclusion: Semantic Surgery提供了一种实用的训练免费解决方案，既能作为内置威胁检测系统，又能确保更安全的文本到图像生成。

Abstract: Concept erasure in text-to-image diffusion models is crucial for mitigating
harmful content, yet existing methods often compromise generative quality. We
introduce Semantic Surgery, a novel training-free, zero-shot framework for
concept erasure that operates directly on text embeddings before the diffusion
process. It dynamically estimates the presence of target concepts in a prompt
and performs a calibrated vector subtraction to neutralize their influence at
the source, enhancing both erasure completeness and locality. The framework
includes a Co-Occurrence Encoding module for robust multi-concept erasure and a
visual feedback loop to address latent concept persistence. As a training-free
method, Semantic Surgery adapts dynamically to each prompt, ensuring precise
interventions. Extensive experiments on object, explicit content, artistic
style, and multi-celebrity erasure tasks show our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. We achieve superior completeness and
robustness while preserving locality and image quality (e.g., 93.58 H-score in
object erasure, reducing explicit content to just 1 instance, and 8.09 H_a in
style erasure with no quality degradation). This robustness also allows our
framework to function as a built-in threat detection system, offering a
practical solution for safer text-to-image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决风电叶片检测中依赖大型标注数据集的问题，特别是在检测罕见或演化损伤类型时的局限性。

Method: 构建包含技术文档、参考图像和领域指南的多模态知识库，使用混合文本-图像检索器结合关键词感知重排来组装最相关上下文，在推理时为VLM注入领域知识。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了数据高效的工业检测解决方案，具有可解释性和泛化性优势，减少了对大量标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: Wind turbine blades operate in harsh environments, making timely damage
detection essential for preventing failures and optimizing maintenance.
Drone-based inspection and deep learning are promising, but typically depend on
large, labeled datasets, which limit their ability to detect rare or evolving
damage types. To address this, we propose a zero-shot-oriented inspection
framework that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with
Vision-Language Models (VLM). A multimodal knowledge base is constructed,
comprising technical documentation, representative reference images, and
domain-specific guidelines. A hybrid text-image retriever with keyword-aware
reranking assembles the most relevant context to condition the VLM at
inference, injecting domain knowledge without task-specific training. We
evaluate the framework on 30 labeled blade images covering diverse damage
categories. Although the dataset is small due to the difficulty of acquiring
verified blade imagery, it covers multiple representative defect types. On this
test set, the RAG-grounded VLM correctly classified all samples, whereas the
same VLM without retrieval performed worse in both accuracy and precision. We
further compare against open-vocabulary baselines and incorporate uncertainty
Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals to account for the small-sample setting.
Ablation studies indicate that the key advantage of the framework lies in
explainability and generalizability: retrieved references ground the reasoning
process and enable the detection of previously unseen defects by leveraging
domain knowledge rather than relying solely on visual cues. This research
contributes a data-efficient solution for industrial inspection that reduces
dependence on extensive labeled datasets.

### [254] [Gen-LangSplat: Generalized Language Gaussian Splatting with Pre-Trained Feature Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22930)
*Pranav Saxena*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gen-LangSplat通过使用预训练的通用自动编码器替代场景特定的语言自动编码器，消除了3D语言场构建中的场景特定训练瓶颈，实现了更高的效率和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如LangSplat需要为每个场景训练特定的语言自动编码器进行特征压缩，这带来了昂贵的每场景优化瓶颈，限制了部署的可扩展性。

Method: 使用在ScanNet数据集上预训练的通用自动编码器，为任何新场景提供固定的紧凑潜在空间，无需场景特定训练。通过消融研究确定最优潜在嵌入维度。

Result: 整个语言场构建过程效率显著提升，查询性能与原LangSplat方法相当或更好，使用MSE和余弦相似度验证了表示保真度。

Conclusion: 通用嵌入能够高效准确地支持新3D场景中的开放词汇查询，为可扩展的实时交互3D AI应用铺平道路。

Abstract: Modeling open-vocabulary language fields in 3D is essential for intuitive
human-AI interaction and querying within physical environments.
State-of-the-art approaches, such as LangSplat, leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting
to efficiently construct these language fields, encoding features distilled
from high-dimensional models like CLIP. However, this efficiency is currently
offset by the requirement to train a scene-specific language autoencoder for
feature compression, introducing a costly, per-scene optimization bottleneck
that hinders deployment scalability. In this work, we introduce Gen-LangSplat,
that eliminates this requirement by replacing the scene-wise autoencoder with a
generalized autoencoder, pre-trained extensively on the large-scale ScanNet
dataset. This architectural shift enables the use of a fixed, compact latent
space for language features across any new scene without any scene-specific
training. By removing this dependency, our entire language field construction
process achieves a efficiency boost while delivering querying performance
comparable to, or exceeding, the original LangSplat method. To validate our
design choice, we perform a thorough ablation study empirically determining the
optimal latent embedding dimension and quantifying representational fidelity
using Mean Squared Error and cosine similarity between the original and
reprojected 512-dimensional CLIP embeddings. Our results demonstrate that
generalized embeddings can efficiently and accurately support open-vocabulary
querying in novel 3D scenes, paving the way for scalable, real-time interactive
3D AI applications.

*Mouxiao Huang,Borui Jiang,Dehua Zheng,Hailin Hu,Kai Han,Xinghao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PPE的位置保持嵌入方法，用于解决多模态大语言模型中视觉令牌压缩时空间布局和时间连续性被破坏的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的令牌合并方法在减少序列长度时经常破坏空间布局和时间连续性，因为它们忽视了位置关系。

Method: PPE在令牌维度上显式引入3D位置的解耦编码，使每个压缩令牌能够封装来自多个原始令牌的不同位置。支持级联聚类策略进行渐进式令牌压缩。

Result: 在多个视觉语言基准测试中（MMBench、TextVQA、VideoMME）实现了2%~5%的持续改进。

Conclusion: 保留位置线索对于高效有效的MLLM推理至关重要。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
vision-language tasks, yet often suffer from inefficiencies due to redundant
visual tokens. Existing token merging methods reduce sequence length but
frequently disrupt spatial layouts and temporal continuity by disregarding
positional relationships. In this work, we propose a novel encoding operator
dubbed as \textbf{P}ositional \textbf{P}reservation \textbf{E}mbedding
(\textbf{PPE}), which has the main hallmark of preservation of spatiotemporal
structure during visual token compression. PPE explicitly introduces the
disentangled encoding of 3D positions in the token dimension, enabling each
compressed token to encapsulate different positions from multiple original
tokens. Furthermore, we show that PPE can effectively support cascade
clustering -- a progressive token compression strategy that leads to better
performance retention. PPE is a parameter-free and generic operator that can be
seamlessly integrated into existing token merging methods without any
adjustments. Applied to state-of-the-art token merging framework, PPE achieves
consistent improvements of $2\%\sim5\%$ across multiple vision-language
benchmarks, including MMBench (general vision understanding), TextVQA (layout
understanding) and VideoMME (temporal understanding). These results demonstrate
that preserving positional cues is critical for efficient and effective MLLM
reasoning.

*Matthew So,Judah Goldfeder,Mark Lis,Hod Lipson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究挑战了生物特征统计不相关的传统假设，通过训练Bi-Encoder网络在指纹-指纹、虹膜-虹膜和跨模态指纹-虹膜匹配任务上，发现个体左右虹膜存在相关性，指纹模型也证实了先前研究的发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统假设——个体生物特征统计不相关，验证不同生物特征之间是否存在统计相关性。

Method: 使用274名受试者的约10万张指纹和7千张虹膜图像，训练基于ResNet-50和Vision Transformer的Bi-Encoder网络，通过对比损失最小化同一受试者图像间的差异。

Result: 虹膜ResNet架构在虹膜-虹膜匹配中达到91% ROC AUC，证明个体左右虹膜相关；指纹模型重现了先前研究的发现；跨模态匹配仅略高于随机水平。

Conclusion: 研究结果继续挑战生物特征独立性的假设，未来计划扩展到其他生物特征，需要更多数据和更复杂的流程来获得有说服力的跨模态匹配结果。

Abstract: There has been a historic assumption that the biometrics of an individual are
statistically uncorrelated. We test this assumption by training Bi-Encoder
networks on three verification tasks, including fingerprint-to-fingerprint
matching, iris-to-iris matching, and cross-modal fingerprint-to-iris matching
using 274 subjects with $\sim$100k fingerprints and 7k iris images. We trained
ResNet-50 and Vision Transformer backbones in Bi-Encoder architectures such
that the contrastive loss between images sampled from the same individual is
minimized. The iris ResNet architecture reaches 91 ROC AUC score for
iris-to-iris matching, providing clear evidence that the left and right irises
of an individual are correlated. Fingerprint models reproduce the positive
intra-subject suggested by prior work in this space. This is the first work
attempting to use Vision Transformers for this matching. Cross-modal matching
rises only slightly above chance, which suggests that more data and a more
sophisticated pipeline is needed to obtain compelling results. These findings
continue challenge independence assumptions of biometrics and we plan to extend
this work to other biometrics in the future. Code available:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可切换的令牌特定码本量化方法，用于人脸图像压缩，通过为不同图像类别学习不同的码本组，并为每个令牌分配独立码本，在低比特率下显著提升重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于码本的图像压缩方法使用全局共享码本，忽略了人脸图像中类别特定的相关性和令牌间的语义差异，导致在低比特率下性能不佳。

Method: 学习不同图像类别的码本组，为每个令牌分配独立码本，通过少量比特记录每个令牌所属的码本组，在降低单个码本组大小的同时增加总码本数量。

Result: 在人脸识别数据集上，在0.05 bpp下重建图像的平均准确率达到93.51%。

Conclusion: 该方法可集成到任何现有的基于码本的表征学习方法中，通过令牌特定的码本量化显著提升了低比特率下的重建性能。

Abstract: With the ever-increasing volume of visual data, the efficient and lossless
transmission, along with its subsequent interpretation and understanding, has
become a critical bottleneck in modern information systems. The emerged
codebook-based solution utilize a globally shared codebook to quantize and
dequantize each token, controlling the bpp by adjusting the number of tokens or
the codebook size. However, for facial images, which are rich in attributes,
such global codebook strategies overlook both the category-specific
correlations within images and the semantic differences among tokens, resulting
in suboptimal performance, especially at low bpp. Motivated by these
observations, we propose a Switchable Token-Specific Codebook Quantization for
face image compression, which learns distinct codebook groups for different
image categories and assigns an independent codebook to each token. By
recording the codebook group to which each token belongs with a small number of
bits, our method can reduce the loss incurred when decreasing the size of each
codebook group. This enables a larger total number of codebooks under a lower
overall bpp, thereby enhancing the expressive capability and improving
reconstruction performance. Owing to its generalizable design, our method can
be integrated into any existing codebook-based representation learning approach
and has demonstrated its effectiveness on face recognition datasets, achieving
an average accuracy of 93.51% for reconstructed images at 0.05 bpp.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统一多模态模型通常需要从头训练且计算资源消耗大，而通过策略性地融合公开可用的专门模型可以更高效地获得竞争性性能。

Method: 保留原始模型块的同时在网络中交错插入多模态自注意力块，采用双重融合机制，既实现丰富的多模态融合又保留基础模型优势。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异：GenEval 0.91（组合文本到图像生成），DPG-Bench 82.16（复杂文本到图像生成），GEditBench 6.06，ImgEdit-Bench 3.77（图像编辑）。

Conclusion: 通过完全发布代码、模型权重和数据集，支持未来统一多模态建模研究，证明了融合现有专门模型的高效性。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have recently shown remarkable gains in both
capability and versatility, yet most leading systems are still trained from
scratch and require substantial computational resources. In this paper, we show
that competitive performance can be obtained far more efficiently by
strategically fusing publicly available models specialized for either
generation or understanding. Our key design is to retain the original blocks
while additionally interleaving multimodal self-attention blocks throughout the
networks. This double fusion mechanism (1) effectively enables rich multi-modal
fusion while largely preserving the original strengths of the base models, and
(2) catalyzes synergistic fusion of high-level semantic representations from
the understanding encoder with low-level spatial signals from the generation
encoder. By training with only ~ 35B tokens, this approach achieves strong
results across multiple benchmarks: 0.91 on GenEval for compositional
text-to-image generation, 82.16 on DPG-Bench for complex text-to-image
generation, 6.06 on GEditBench, and 3.77 on ImgEdit-Bench for image editing. By
fully releasing the entire suite of code, model weights, and datasets, we hope
to support future research on unified multimodal modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的免训练视频编辑模型在处理职业相关提示时倾向于依赖性别刻板印象，存在公平性问题。

Method: 通过软注入去偏标记到文本编码器获得公平嵌入，并在时间自注意力和跨注意力中集成公平调制，包括区域约束注意力掩码和时间衰减加权。

Result: 在FairVE基准测试中，FAME实现了更强的公平对齐和语义保真度，超越了现有视频编辑基线方法。

Conclusion: FAME通过公平感知的注意力调制有效减轻了视频编辑中的性别偏见，同时保持了编辑质量和时间一致性。

Abstract: Training-free video editing (VE) models tend to fall back on gender
stereotypes when rendering profession-related prompts. We propose \textbf{FAME}
for \textit{Fairness-aware Attention-modulated Video Editing} that mitigates
profession-related gender biases while preserving prompt alignment and temporal
consistency for coherent VE. We derive fairness embeddings from existing
minority representations by softly injecting debiasing tokens into the text
encoder. Simultaneously, FAME integrates fairness modulation into both temporal
self attention and prompt-to-region cross attention to mitigate the motion
corruption and temporal inconsistency caused by directly introducing fairness
cues. For temporal self attention, FAME introduces a region constrained
attention mask combined with time decay weighting, which enhances intra-region
coherence while suppressing irrelevant inter-region interactions. For cross
attention, it reweights tokens to region matching scores by incorporating
fairness sensitive similarity masks derived from debiasing prompt embeddings.
Together, these modulations keep fairness-sensitive semantics tied to the right
visual regions and prevent temporal drift across frames. Extensive experiments
on new VE fairness-oriented benchmark \textit{FairVE} demonstrate that FAME
achieves stronger fairness alignment and semantic fidelity, surpassing existing
VE baselines.

Abstract: Foundation models have transformed natural language processing and computer
vision, and their impact is now reshaping remote sensing image analysis. With
powerful generalization and transfer learning capabilities, they align
naturally with the multimodal, multi-resolution, and multi-temporal
characteristics of remote sensing data. To address unique challenges in the
field, multimodal geospatial foundation models (GFMs) have emerged as a
dedicated research frontier. This survey delivers a comprehensive review of
multimodal GFMs from a modality-driven perspective, covering five core visual
and vision-language modalities. We examine how differences in imaging physics
and data representation shape interaction design, and we analyze key techniques
for alignment, integration, and knowledge transfer to tackle modality
heterogeneity, distribution shifts, and semantic gaps. Advances in training
paradigms, architectures, and task-specific adaptation strategies are
systematically assessed alongside a wealth of emerging benchmarks.
Representative multimodal visual and vision-language GFMs are evaluated across
ten downstream tasks, with insights into their architectures, performance, and
application scenarios. Real-world case studies, spanning land cover mapping,
agricultural monitoring, disaster response, climate studies, and geospatial
intelligence, demonstrate the practical potential of GFMs. Finally, we outline
pressing challenges in domain generalization, interpretability, efficiency, and
privacy, and chart promising avenues for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖启发式帧选择来维持DDIM反演的时间一致性，这会引入人工偏差并降低端到端推理的可扩展性。

Method: VALA采用变分框架和对比学习目标，将跨帧潜在表示压缩为保留内容和时间一致性的潜在锚点。

Result: 在真实世界视频编辑基准测试中，VALA在反演保真度、编辑质量和时间一致性方面达到最先进性能，同时比先前方法更高效。

Conclusion: VALA通过变分对齐模块有效解决了训练无关视频编辑中的时间一致性问题，实现了高质量且高效的结果。

Abstract: Recent advances in training-free video editing have enabled lightweight and
precise cross-frame generation by leveraging pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models. However, existing methods often rely on heuristic frame
selection to maintain temporal consistency during DDIM inversion, which
introduces manual bias and reduces the scalability of end-to-end inference. In
this paper, we propose~\textbf{VALA} (\textbf{V}ariational \textbf{A}lignment
for \textbf{L}atent \textbf{A}nchors), a variational alignment module that
adaptively selects key frames and compresses their latent features into
semantic anchors for consistent video editing. To learn meaningful assignments,
VALA propose a variational framework with a contrastive learning objective.
Therefore, it can transform cross-frame latent representations into compressed
latent anchors that preserve both content and temporal coherence. Our method
can be fully integrated into training-free text-to-image based video editing
models. Extensive experiments on real-world video editing benchmarks show that
VALA achieves state-of-the-art performance in inversion fidelity, editing
quality, and temporal consistency, while offering improved efficiency over
prior methods.

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架在驾驶场景生成方面表现出色，为自动驾驶的下游应用提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Driving scene generation is a critical domain for autonomous driving,
enabling downstream applications, including perception and planning evaluation.
Occupancy-centric methods have recently achieved state-of-the-art results by
offering consistent conditioning across frames and modalities; however, their
performance heavily depends on annotated occupancy data, which still remains
scarce. To overcome this limitation, we curate Nuplan-Occ, the largest semantic
occupancy dataset to date, constructed from the widely used Nuplan benchmark.
Its scale and diversity facilitate not only large-scale generative modeling but
also autonomous driving downstream applications. Based on this dataset, we
develop a unified framework that jointly synthesizes high-quality semantic
occupancy, multi-view videos, and LiDAR point clouds. Our approach incorporates
a spatio-temporal disentangled architecture to support high-fidelity spatial
expansion and temporal forecasting of 4D dynamic occupancy. To bridge modal
gaps, we further propose two novel techniques: a Gaussian splatting-based
sparse point map rendering strategy that enhances multi-view video generation,
and a sensor-aware embedding strategy that explicitly models LiDAR sensor
properties for realistic multi-LiDAR simulation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves superior generation fidelity and
scalability compared to existing approaches, and validates its practical value
in downstream tasks. Repo:

Motivation: 物理仿真依赖空间变化的力学属性，传统方法需要手工制作，过程繁琐。VoMP旨在自动预测3D物体的体积材料属性。

Method: 使用多视图特征聚合，通过训练的几何Transformer预测每个体素的材料潜在编码，这些编码位于从真实世界数据集学习的物理合理材料流形上。

Result: VoMP能够准确估计体积属性，在精度和速度方面显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: VoMP提供了一种有效的方法来自动预测3D物体的材料属性，解决了传统手工制作的繁琐问题。

Abstract: Physical simulation relies on spatially-varying mechanical properties, often
laboriously hand-crafted. VoMP is a feed-forward method trained to predict
Young's modulus ($E$), Poisson's ratio ($\nu$), and density ($\rho$) throughout
the volume of 3D objects, in any representation that can be rendered and
voxelized. VoMP aggregates per-voxel multi-view features and passes them to our
trained Geometry Transformer to predict per-voxel material latent codes. These
latents reside on a manifold of physically plausible materials, which we learn
from a real-world dataset, guaranteeing the validity of decoded per-voxel
materials. To obtain object-level training data, we propose an annotation
pipeline combining knowledge from segmented 3D datasets, material databases,
and a vision-language model, along with a new benchmark. Experiments show that
VoMP estimates accurate volumetric properties, far outperforming prior art in
accuracy and speed.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image models have revolutionized image generation, but they
still struggle with maintaining concept consistency across generated images.
While existing works focus on character consistency, they often overlook the
crucial role of scenes in storytelling, which restricts their creativity in
practice. This paper introduces scene-oriented story generation, addressing two
key challenges: (i) scene planning, where current methods fail to ensure
scene-level narrative coherence by relying solely on text descriptions, and
(ii) scene consistency, which remains largely unexplored in terms of
maintaining scene consistency across multiple stories. We propose
SceneDecorator, a training-free framework that employs VLM-Guided Scene
Planning to ensure narrative coherence across different scenes in a
``global-to-local'' manner, and Long-Term Scene-Sharing Attention to maintain
long-term scene consistency and subject diversity across generated stories.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of SceneDecorator,
highlighting its potential to unleash creativity in the fields of arts, films,
and games.

TL;DR: 提出LoMix模块，通过可学习的加权混合多尺度特征，自动发现最优的尺度和融合方式，提升U型网络性能且无推理开销


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有U型网络在多尺度输出训练时，要么只监督最终输出，要么对所有尺度使用相同权重，未能充分利用粗细尺度特征的互补性

Method: 引入LoMix模块，使用四种轻量级融合算子（加法、乘法、连接、注意力加权）混合多尺度logits，生成丰富的合成特征图，并通过可学习的softplus损失权重与网络参数共同优化

Result: 在Synapse 8-organ数据集上，相比单输出监督提升DICE 4.2%，相比深度监督提升2.2%，在数据稀缺情况下优势更明显（提升9.23%），在四个基准测试中最高提升13.5%

Conclusion: LoMix通过可学习的加权混合尺度融合，能够广泛提升U型网络性能，同时保持数据高效、完全可解释且无推理开销

Abstract: U-shaped networks output logits at multiple spatial scales, each capturing a
different blend of coarse context and fine detail. Yet, training still treats
these logits in isolation - either supervising only the final,
highest-resolution logits or applying deep supervision with identical loss
weights at every scale - without exploring mixed-scale combinations.
Consequently, the decoder output misses the complementary cues that arise only
when coarse and fine predictions are fused. To address this issue, we introduce
LoMix (Logits Mixing), a NAS-inspired, differentiable plug-and-play module that
generates new mixed-scale outputs and learns how exactly each of them should
guide the training process. More precisely, LoMix mixes the multi-scale decoder
logits with four lightweight fusion operators: addition, multiplication,
concatenation, and attention-based weighted fusion, yielding a rich set of
synthetic mutant maps. Every original or mutant map is given a softplus loss
weight that is co-optimized with network parameters, mimicking a one-step
architecture search that automatically discovers the most useful scales,
mixtures, and operators. Plugging LoMix into recent U-shaped architectures
(i.e., PVT-V2-B2 backbone with EMCAD decoder) on Synapse 8-organ dataset
improves DICE by +4.2% over single-output supervision, +2.2% over deep
supervision, and +1.5% over equally weighted additive fusion, all with zero
inference overhead. When training data are scarce (e.g., one or two labeled
scans), the advantage grows to +9.23%, underscoring LoMix's data efficiency.
Across four benchmarks and diverse U-shaped networks, LoMiX improves DICE by up
to +13.5% over single-output supervision, confirming that learnable weighted
mixed-scale fusion generalizes broadly while remaining data efficient, fully
interpretable, and overhead-free at inference. Our code is available at
https://github.com/SLDGroup/LoMix.

TL;DR: CoMo是一个用于文本到视频生成的组合运动定制框架，能够在一个视频中合成多个不同的运动，解决了现有方法在组合场景中的运动-外观纠缠和多运动融合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到视频模型在生成多样化场景方面表现出色，但在精确运动控制方面存在困难，特别是在处理复杂多主体运动时。现有的单运动定制方法在组合场景中失效，主要由于运动-外观纠缠和无效的多运动融合两个挑战。

Method: CoMo采用两阶段方法：1) 单运动学习阶段，通过静态-动态解耦调优范式将运动与外观解耦，学习运动特定模块；2) 多运动组合阶段，通过即插即用的分治策略，在去噪过程中空间隔离不同运动的影响，无需额外训练即可组合学习到的运动。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，CoMo实现了最先进的性能，显著提升了可控视频生成的能力。作者还为此新领域引入了新的基准和评估指标来评估多运动保真度和融合效果。

Conclusion: CoMo框架通过其创新的两阶段方法和空间隔离策略，成功解决了多运动定制中的关键挑战，为可控视频生成开辟了新的研究方向。

Abstract: While recent text-to-video models excel at generating diverse scenes, they
struggle with precise motion control, particularly for complex, multi-subject
motions. Although methods for single-motion customization have been developed
to address this gap, they fail in compositional scenarios due to two primary
challenges: motion-appearance entanglement and ineffective multi-motion
blending. This paper introduces CoMo, a novel framework for
$\textbf{compositional motion customization}$ in text-to-video generation,
enabling the synthesis of multiple, distinct motions within a single video.
CoMo addresses these issues through a two-phase approach. First, in the
single-motion learning phase, a static-dynamic decoupled tuning paradigm
disentangles motion from appearance to learn a motion-specific module. Second,
in the multi-motion composition phase, a plug-and-play divide-and-merge
strategy composes these learned motions without additional training by
spatially isolating their influence during the denoising process. To facilitate

*Pan Zhao,Hui Yuan,Chongzhen Tian,Tian Guo,Raouf Hamzaoui,Zhigeng Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出统一几何与属性增强框架(UGAE)，包含后几何增强、前属性增强和后属性增强三个核心组件，显著提升点云压缩质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点云的有损压缩会不可避免地导致几何结构和属性信息的不可逆失真，需要解决压缩后的质量增强问题

Method: 使用基于Transformer的稀疏卷积U-Net重建几何结构，采用细节感知KNN的增强几何引导重着色策略，以及带加权MSE损失的属性残差预测网络

Result: 在8iVFB、Owlii和MVUB三个基准数据集上显著优于现有方法，相比G-PCC测试模型，几何BD-PSNR提升9.98dB，属性Y分量BD-PSNR提升3.67dB

Conclusion: UGAE框架有效提升了点云压缩的几何和属性质量，同时显著改善了感知质量

Abstract: Lossy compression of point clouds reduces storage and transmission costs;
however, it inevitably leads to irreversible distortion in geometry structure
and attribute information. To address these issues, we propose a unified
geometry and attribute enhancement (UGAE) framework, which consists of three
core components: post-geometry enhancement (PoGE), pre-attribute enhancement
(PAE), and post-attribute enhancement (PoAE). In PoGE, a Transformer-based
sparse convolutional U-Net is used to reconstruct the geometry structure with
high precision by predicting voxel occupancy probabilities. Building on the
refined geometry structure, PAE introduces an innovative enhanced
geometry-guided recoloring strategy, which uses a detail-aware K-Nearest
Neighbors (DA-KNN) method to achieve accurate recoloring and effectively
preserve high-frequency details before attribute compression. Finally, at the
decoder side, PoAE uses an attribute residual prediction network with a
weighted mean squared error (W-MSE) loss to enhance the quality of
high-frequency regions while maintaining the fidelity of low-frequency regions.
UGAE significantly outperformed existing methods on three benchmark datasets:
8iVFB, Owlii, and MVUB. Compared to the latest G-PCC test model (TMC13v29),
UGAE achieved an average BD-PSNR gain of 9.98 dB and 90.98% BD-bitrate savings
for geometry under the D1 metric, as well as a 3.67 dB BD-PSNR improvement with
56.88% BD-bitrate savings for attributes on the Y component. Additionally, it
improved perceptual quality significantly.

*Hongyu Wu,Xuhui Fan,Zhangkai Wu,Longbing Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了NestAR模型，通过嵌套自回归架构和分层多尺度模块，将图像生成的复杂度从O(n)降低到O(log n)，同时提高样本多样性并降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归模型在图像生成中计算密集，且VAR等解决方案导致样本多样性有限，需要更高效的生成方法。

Method: 采用嵌套自回归架构，设计分层多尺度模块，每个大尺度模块基于前一个小尺度模块的输出，内部使用另一个AR结构生成token块，并结合流匹配损失和连续token。

Result: NestAR在保持竞争力的图像生成性能的同时，显著降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: NestAR通过嵌套自回归架构成功解决了AR模型的计算密集和多样性有限问题，实现了高效高质量的图像生成。

Abstract: AutoRegressive (AR) models have demonstrated competitive performance in image
generation, achieving results comparable to those of diffusion models. However,
their token-by-token image generation mechanism remains computationally
intensive and existing solutions such as VAR often lead to limited sample
diversity. In this work, we propose a Nested AutoRegressive~(NestAR) model,
which proposes nested AutoRegressive architectures in generating images. NestAR
designs multi-scale modules in a hierarchical order. These different scaled
modules are constructed in an AR architecture, where one larger-scale module is
conditioned on outputs from its previous smaller-scale module. Within each
module, NestAR uses another AR structure to generate ``patches'' of tokens. The
proposed nested AR architecture reduces the overall complexity from
$\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ in generating $n$ image tokens, as
well as increases image diversities. NestAR further incorporates flow matching
loss to use continuous tokens, and develops objectives to coordinate these
multi-scale modules in model training. NestAR achieves competitive image
generation performance while significantly lowering computational cost.

*Joungbin An,Kristen Grauman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HieraMamba是一种分层架构，通过Anchor-MambaPooling块和对比损失，在长视频中保持时间结构，实现精确的时间定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长视频中过度下采样或依赖固定窗口，导致时间保真度不足，需要同时捕捉全局上下文和细粒度时间细节。

Method: 使用分层架构和AMP块，通过Mamba的选择性扫描生成多粒度锚点令牌，结合锚点条件和段池化对比损失。

Result: 在Ego4D-NLQ、MAD和TACoS数据集上达到新的最先进水平，实现了长未修剪视频中的精确时间定位。

Conclusion: HieraMamba能够有效保持时间结构和语义丰富性，在长视频时间定位任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Video temporal grounding, the task of localizing the start and end times of a
natural language query in untrimmed video, requires capturing both global
context and fine-grained temporal detail. This challenge is particularly
pronounced in long videos, where existing methods often compromise temporal
fidelity by over-downsampling or relying on fixed windows. We present
HieraMamba, a hierarchical architecture that preserves temporal structure and
semantic richness across scales. At its core are Anchor-MambaPooling (AMP)
blocks, which utilize Mamba's selective scanning to produce compact anchor
tokens that summarize video content at multiple granularities. Two
complementary objectives, anchor-conditioned and segment-pooled contrastive
losses, encourage anchors to retain local detail while remaining globally
discriminative. HieraMamba sets a new state-of-the-art on Ego4D-NLQ, MAD, and
TACoS, demonstrating precise, temporally faithful localization in long,
untrimmed videos.

TL;DR: EndoWave是一个用于内窥镜视频3D重建的统一时空高斯溅射框架，通过结合基于光流的几何约束和多分辨率有理小波监督，解决了内窥镜场景中的光度不一致、非刚性组织运动和视角相关高光等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器人辅助微创手术中，从内窥镜视频进行准确的3D重建对下游任务和改善手术结果至关重要。但内窥镜场景存在独特挑战，包括光度不一致、非刚性组织运动和视角相关高光，仅依赖外观约束的3DGS方法往往不足。

Method: 1. 采用统一的时空高斯表示，直接在4D域中优化基元；2. 提出基于光流的几何约束来增强时间一致性并有效约束场景的3D结构；3. 提出多分辨率有理正交小波作为约束，能有效分离内窥镜细节并增强渲染性能。

Result: 在两个真实手术数据集EndoNeRF和StereoMIS上的广泛评估表明，EndoWave相比基线方法实现了最先进的重建质量和视觉精度。

Conclusion: EndoWave通过结合几何约束和小波监督，有效解决了内窥镜3D重建中的挑战，在手术数据集上取得了优异的重建效果。

Abstract: In robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery, accurate 3D reconstruction from
endoscopic video is vital for downstream tasks and improved outcomes. However,
endoscopic scenarios present unique challenges, including photometric
inconsistencies, non-rigid tissue motion, and view-dependent highlights. Most
3DGS-based methods that rely solely on appearance constraints for optimizing
3DGS are often insufficient in this context, as these dynamic visual artifacts
can mislead the optimization process and lead to inaccurate reconstructions. To
address these limitations, we present EndoWave, a unified spatio-temporal
Gaussian Splatting framework by incorporating an optical flow-based geometric
constraint and a multi-resolution rational wavelet supervision. First, we adopt
a unified spatio-temporal Gaussian representation that directly optimizes
primitives in a 4D domain. Second, we propose a geometric constraint derived
from optical flow to enhance temporal coherence and effectively constrain the
3D structure of the scene. Third, we propose a multi-resolution rational
orthogonal wavelet as a constraint, which can effectively separate the details
of the endoscope and enhance the rendering performance. Extensive evaluations
on two real surgical datasets, EndoNeRF and StereoMIS, demonstrate that our
method EndoWave achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and visual
accuracy compared to the baseline method.

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种多模态旋转位置编码变体MHRoPE和MRoPE-I，通过位置连贯性、全频率利用和文本先验保持三个关键原则，在多样化基准测试中显著提升多模态理解性能。


<details>

Motivation: 多模态位置编码对视觉语言模型至关重要，但目前缺乏系统性的研究。本文旨在全面分析多模态旋转位置编码(RoPE)的核心组件：位置设计和频率分配。

Method: 提出了两种简单即插即用的变体：多头部RoPE(MHRoPE)和MRoPE交错(MRoPE-I)，无需架构改动。基于位置连贯性、全频率利用和保持文本先验三个关键原则。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，所提方法持续优于现有方法，在通用和细粒度多模态理解方面均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过系统分析多模态RoPE并基于三个关键原则提出的MHRoPE和MRoPE-I变体，有效提升了多模态理解性能，为多模态位置编码提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Multimodal position encoding is essential for vision-language models, yet
there has been little systematic investigation into multimodal position
encoding. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of multimodal Rotary Positional
Embedding (RoPE) by examining its two core components: position design and
frequency allocation. Through extensive experiments, we identify three key
guidelines: positional coherence, full frequency utilization, and preservation
of textual priors-ensuring unambiguous layout, rich representation, and
faithful transfer from the pre-trained LLM. Based on these insights, we propose
Multi-Head RoPE (MHRoPE) and MRoPE-Interleave (MRoPE-I), two simple and
plug-and-play variants that require no architectural changes. Our methods
consistently outperform existing approaches across diverse benchmarks, with
significant improvements in both general and fine-grained multimodal
understanding. Code will be avaliable at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出残差扩散桥模型(RDBM)，通过理论推导统一分析扩散桥模型，利用残差调制噪声注入和去除，实现自适应图像修复同时保护未退化区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散桥模型缺乏统一分析视角，且通过全局噪声注入和去除重建图像会扭曲未退化区域。需要一种能自适应修复退化区域同时保护完好区域的方法。

Method: 理论重构广义扩散桥的随机微分方程，推导其正向和反向过程的解析公式。利用给定分布的残差来调制噪声注入和去除过程。

Result: 实验证明RDBM在多种图像修复任务中达到最先进性能，现有桥模型都是RDBM的特例，验证了所提模型的最优性。

Conclusion: RDBM提供了一种统一的扩散桥模型分析框架，通过残差调制实现自适应图像修复，在保持未退化区域完整性的同时有效修复退化区域。

Abstract: Diffusion bridge models establish probabilistic paths between arbitrary
paired distributions and exhibit great potential for universal image
restoration. Most existing methods merely treat them as simple variants of
stochastic interpolants, lacking a unified analytical perspective. Besides,
they indiscriminately reconstruct images through global noise injection and
removal, inevitably distorting undegraded regions due to imperfect
reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose the Residual Diffusion
Bridge Model (RDBM). Specifically, we theoretically reformulate the stochastic
differential equations of generalized diffusion bridge and derive the
analytical formulas of its forward and reverse processes. Crucially, we
leverage the residuals from given distributions to modulate the noise injection
and removal, enabling adaptive restoration of degraded regions while preserving
intact others. Moreover, we unravel the fundamental mathematical essence of
existing bridge models, all of which are special cases of RDBM and empirically
demonstrate the optimality of our proposed models. Extensive experiments are
conducted to demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method both
qualitatively and quantitatively across diverse image restoration tasks. Code
is publicly available at https://github.com/MiliLab/RDBM.

Method: 采用确定性和学习策略进行时间序列量化，利用掩码相关性学习目标，在统一表示空间中对齐离散的图像和时间序列标记。

Result: 在地球观测领域的实验中，预训练模型能够从卫星图像生成一致的全球温度剖面，在下游任务中比任务特定融合方法平均提高6%的R²和2%的RMSE，比基线方法提高50%的R²和12%的RMSE。

Conclusion: 该任务无关预训练框架在多模态融合方面表现出色，并通过梯度敏感性分析提供了模型稳健性的见解。

Abstract: We propose a task-agnostic framework for multimodal fusion of time series and
single timestamp images, enabling cross-modal generation and robust downstream
performance. Our approach explores deterministic and learned strategies for
time series quantization and then leverages a masked correlation learning
objective, aligning discrete image and time series tokens in a unified
representation space. Instantiated in the Earth observation domain, the
pretrained model generates consistent global temperature profiles from
satellite imagery and is validated through counterfactual experiments. Across
downstream tasks, our task-agnostic pretraining outperforms task-specific
fusion by 6\% in R$^2$ and 2\% in RMSE on average, and exceeds baseline methods
by 50\% in R$^2$ and 12\% in RMSE. Finally, we analyze gradient sensitivity
across modalities, providing insights into model robustness. Code, data, and
weights will be released under a permissive license.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 土壤盐渍化威胁生态系统和农业，实验室光谱精确但难以扩展到大尺度，卫星高光谱可大范围观测但分辨率不足，需要桥接这一差距。

Method: 使用知识蒸馏和新型光谱适应单元，将实验室光谱的高分辨率信息迁移到卫星高光谱数据中。

Result: DeepSalt在综合基准测试中显著优于无显式域适应的方法，有效泛化到未见地理区域，解释了大部分盐度方差。

Conclusion: 所提出的光谱适应单元和知识蒸馏策略具有重要影响，能够实现准确的大尺度盐度估算而无需大量地面采样。

Abstract: Soil salinization poses a significant threat to both ecosystems and
agriculture because it limits plants' ability to absorb water and, in doing so,
reduces crop productivity. This phenomenon alters the soil's spectral
properties, creating a measurable relationship between salinity and light
reflectance that enables remote monitoring. While laboratory spectroscopy
provides precise measurements, its reliance on in-situ sampling limits
scalability to regional or global levels. Conversely, hyperspectral satellite
imagery enables wide-area observation but lacks the fine-grained
interpretability of laboratory instruments. To bridge this gap, we introduce
DeepSalt, a deep-learning-based spectral transfer framework that leverages
knowledge distillation and a novel Spectral Adaptation Unit to transfer
high-resolution spectral insights from laboratory-based spectroscopy to
satellite-based hyperspectral sensing. Our approach eliminates the need for
extensive ground sampling while enabling accurate, large-scale salinity
estimation, as demonstrated through comprehensive empirical benchmarks.
DeepSalt achieves significant performance gains over methods without explicit
domain adaptation, underscoring the impact of the proposed Spectral Adaptation
Unit and the knowledge distillation strategy. The model also effectively
generalized to unseen geographic regions, explaining a substantial portion of
the salinity variance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Bigun和Granlund 1987与Granlund和Knutsson 1995提出的两种看似不同的结构张量构造方法之间的理论联系，寻求统一的数学框架。

Method: 通过总最小二乘(TLS)线拟合到功率谱的共同视角来分析两种结构张量构造方法，证明它们可以在该框架下得到统一。

Result: 证明了Granlund和Knutsson 1995的修正项是不必要的，省略该修正项能确保张量保持半正定性；扩展了结构张量的适用范围，允许使用非正交滤波器和其他滤波器类型。

Conclusion: 总最小二乘视角为结构张量提供了统一的数学框架，简化了理论解释并扩展了实际应用的可能性，使结构张量构造更加灵活和通用。

Abstract: This note presents a theoretical discussion of two structure tensor
constructions: one proposed by Bigun and Granlund 1987, and the other by
Granlund and Knutsson 1995. At first glance, these approaches may appear quite
different--the former is implemented by averaging outer products of gradient
filter responses, while the latter constructs the tensor from weighted outer
products of tune-in frequency vectors of quadrature filters. We argue that when
both constructions are viewed through the common lens of Total Least Squares
(TLS) line fitting to the power spectrum, they can be reconciled to a large
extent, and additional benefits emerge. From this perspective, the correction
term introduced in Granlund and Knutsson 1995 becomes unnecessary. Omitting it
ensures that the resulting tensor remains positive semi-definite, thereby
simplifying the interpretation of its eigenvalues. Furthermore, this
interpretation allows fitting more than a single 0rientation to the input by
reinterpreting quadrature filter responses without relying on a structure
tensor. It also removes the constraint that responses must originate strictly
from quadrature filters, allowing the use of alternative filter types and
non-angular tessellations. These alternatives include Gabor filters--which,
although not strictly quadrature, are still suitable for structure tensor
construction--even when they tessellate the spectrum in a Cartesian fashion,
provided they are sufficiently concentrated.

Conclusion: DQ3D方法通过深度引导查询生成和混合注意力机制，有效提升了3D目标检测性能，特别是在处理误检和遮挡物体方面表现优异。

Abstract: 3D object detection from multi-view images in traffic scenarios has garnered
significant attention in recent years. Many existing approaches rely on object
queries that are generated from 3D reference points to localize objects.
However, a limitation of these methods is that some reference points are often
far from the target object, which can lead to false positive detections. In
this paper, we propose a depth-guided query generator for 3D object detection
(DQ3D) that leverages depth information and 2D detections to ensure that
reference points are sampled from the surface or interior of the object.
Furthermore, to address partially occluded objects in current frame, we
introduce a hybrid attention mechanism that fuses historical detection results
with depth-guided queries, thereby forming hybrid queries. Evaluation on the
nuScenes dataset demonstrates that our method outperforms the baseline by 6.3\%
in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP) and 4.3\% in the NuScenes Detection
Score (NDS).

Result: 在涵盖广泛训练机制和模型类型的综合基准测试中，ITM在稳定性、有效性和效率方面持续优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ITM能够泛化到更广泛的模型和下游任务，推进预训练和微调范式的发展。

Abstract: Transferability estimation identifies the best pre-trained models for
downstream tasks without incurring the high computational cost of full
fine-tuning. This capability facilitates deployment and advances the
pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. However, existing methods often struggle
to accurately assess transferability for emerging pre-trained models with
diverse architectures, training strategies, and task alignments. In this work,
we propose Implicit Transferability Modeling (ITM), a novel framework that
implicitly models each model's intrinsic transferability, coupled with a
Divide-and-Conquer Variational Approximation (DVA) strategy to efficiently
approximate embedding space evolution. This design enables generalization
across a broader range of models and downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on
a comprehensive benchmark--spanning extensive training regimes and a wider
variety of model types--demonstrate that ITM consistently outperforms existing
methods in terms of stability, effectiveness, and efficiency.

Abstract: Multimodal camera-LiDAR fusion technology has found extensive application in
3D object detection, demonstrating encouraging performance. However, existing
methods exhibit significant performance degradation in challenging scenarios
characterized by sensor degradation or environmental disturbances. We propose a
novel Adaptive Gated Fusion (AG-Fusion) approach that selectively integrates
cross-modal knowledge by identifying reliable patterns for robust detection in
complex scenes. Specifically, we first project features from each modality into
a unified BEV space and enhance them using a window-based attention mechanism.
Subsequently, an adaptive gated fusion module based on cross-modal attention is
designed to integrate these features into reliable BEV representations robust
to challenging environments. Furthermore, we construct a new dataset named
Excavator3D (E3D) focusing on challenging excavator operation scenarios to
benchmark performance in complex conditions. Our method not only achieves
competitive performance on the standard KITTI dataset with 93.92% accuracy, but
also significantly outperforms the baseline by 24.88% on the challenging E3D

complex industrial scenes.

Abstract: Connecting current observations with prior experiences helps robots adapt and
plan in new, unseen 3D environments. Recently, 3D scene analogies have been
proposed to connect two 3D scenes, which are smooth maps that align scene
regions with common spatial relationships. These maps enable detailed transfer
of trajectories or waypoints, potentially supporting demonstration transfer for
imitation learning or task plan transfer across scenes. However, existing
methods for the task require additional training and fixed object vocabularies.
In this work, we propose to use multimodal foundation models for finding 3D
scene analogies in a zero-shot, open-vocabulary setting. Central to our
approach is a hybrid neural representation of scenes that consists of a sparse
graph based on vision-language model features and a feature field derived from
3D shape foundation models. 3D scene analogies are then found in a
coarse-to-fine manner, by first aligning the graph and refining the
correspondence with feature fields. Our method can establish accurate
correspondences between complex scenes, and we showcase applications in
trajectory and waypoint transfer.

*Pascal Benschop,Cristian Meo,Justin Dauwels,Jelte P. Mense*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究视觉语言模型的空间推理能力，将异常动作识别作为零样本、语言基础任务，通过将视频转换为文本描述并使用文本蕴含来评分标签，评估了四种开源模型在UCF-Crime和RWF-2000数据集上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 摄像头广泛使用产生了海量视频数据，远超人工监控能力，这对公共安全构成挑战，需要及时检测异常或犯罪事件。体现智能体识别意外事件的能力与其空间推理能力密切相关。

Method: 将异常动作识别构建为零样本、语言基础任务，通过预训练的视觉-LLMs将视频转换为文本描述，使用文本蕴含对标签进行评分，评估了四种开源模型在不同提示和隐私保护条件下的表现。

Result: 少量样本示例可以提高某些模型的准确性，但可能增加误报；隐私过滤器（特别是全身GAN变换）会引入不一致性降低准确性。当前视觉-LLMs在简单、空间显著事件上表现良好，但在噪声空间线索和身份混淆方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 提出了无需任务特定训练即可增强空间基础的具体路径：结构感知提示、跨片段的轻量级空间记忆、描述过程中的场景图或3D姿态先验，以及保留动作相关几何的隐私方法。将零样本、语言基础管道定位为体现现实世界视频理解的适应性构建模块。

Abstract: The widespread use of cameras in our society has created an overwhelming
amount of video data, far exceeding the capacity for human monitoring. This
presents a critical challenge for public safety and security, as the timely
detection of anomalous or criminal events is crucial for effective response and
prevention. The ability for an embodied agent to recognize unexpected events is
fundamentally tied to its capacity for spatial reasoning. This paper
investigates the spatial reasoning of vision-language models (VLMs) by framing
anomalous action recognition as a zero-shot, language-grounded task, addressing
the embodied perception challenge of interpreting dynamic 3D scenes from sparse
2D video. Specifically, we investigate whether small, pre-trained vision--LLMs
can act as spatially-grounded, zero-shot anomaly detectors by converting video
into text descriptions and scoring labels via textual entailment. We evaluate
four open models on UCF-Crime and RWF-2000 under prompting and
privacy-preserving conditions. Few-shot exemplars can improve accuracy for some
models, but may increase false positives, and privacy filters -- especially
full-body GAN transforms -- introduce inconsistencies that degrade accuracy.
These results chart where current vision--LLMs succeed (simple, spatially
salient events) and where they falter (noisy spatial cues, identity
obfuscation). Looking forward, we outline concrete paths to strengthen spatial
grounding without task-specific training: structure-aware prompts, lightweight
spatial memory across clips, scene-graph or 3D-pose priors during description,
and privacy methods that preserve action-relevant geometry. This positions
zero-shot, language-grounded pipelines as adaptable building blocks for
embodied, real-world video understanding. Our implementation for evaluating
VLMs is publicly available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DecoDINO是一个基于DECO框架的三分支网络，用于改进人体与物体接触预测，通过双DINOv2编码器、类别平衡损失权重和补丁级交叉注意力，在DAMON基准测试中显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DECO在软表面、遮挡、儿童和误报脚部接触方面的局限性，实现更准确的人体-物体接触预测，这对机器人、AR/VR和行为模拟应用至关重要。

Method: 使用两个DINOv2 ViT-g/14编码器，采用类别平衡损失权重减少偏差，通过补丁级交叉注意力改进局部推理，顶点特征通过轻量级MLP和softmax分配语义接触标签。

Result: 在DAMON基准测试中：(i) 二元接触F1分数提升7%；(ii) 测地误差减半；(iii) 增加对象级语义标签预测；在DAMON挑战赛的两个任务中均优于基准。

Conclusion: DecoDINO通过LoRA微调和双编码器架构显著改进了人体-物体接触预测性能，简化架构优于集成视觉语言模型的方法。

Abstract: Accurate vertex-level contact prediction between humans and surrounding
objects is a prerequisite for high fidelity human object interaction models
used in robotics, AR/VR, and behavioral simulation. DECO was the first in the
wild estimator for this task but is limited to binary contact maps and
struggles with soft surfaces, occlusions, children, and false-positive foot
contacts. We address these issues and introduce DecoDINO, a three-branch
network based on DECO's framework. It uses two DINOv2 ViT-g/14 encoders,
class-balanced loss weighting to reduce bias, and patch-level cross-attention
for improved local reasoning. Vertex features are finally passed through a
lightweight MLP with a softmax to assign semantic contact labels. We also
tested a vision-language model (VLM) to integrate text features, but the
simpler architecture performed better and was used instead. On the DAMON
benchmark, DecoDINO (i) raises the binary-contact F1 score by 7$\%$, (ii)
halves the geodesic error, and (iii) augments predictions with object-level
semantic labels. Ablation studies show that LoRA fine-tuning and the dual
encoders are key to these improvements. DecoDINO outperformed the challenge
baseline in both tasks of the DAMON Challenge. Our code is available at

TL;DR: VR-Drive是一个端到端自动驾驶框架，通过联合学习3D场景重建作为辅助任务来解决视角泛化问题，支持在线训练时从稀疏视图进行增强，无需额外标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端自动驾驶系统在面对不同相机视角时缺乏鲁棒性，这是现实世界中由于车辆配置多样性带来的常见挑战。

Method: 采用前馈推理策略，引入视角混合记忆库促进多视角间的时间交互，以及视角一致性蒸馏策略从原始视图向合成视图传递知识。

Result: VR-Drive有效减轻了合成引起的噪声，在视角变化下改进了规划性能，并发布了新的基准数据集用于评估新相机视角下的性能。

Conclusion: VR-Drive是端到端自动驾驶系统在现实世界部署中可扩展且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) has emerged as a promising paradigm
that unifies perception, prediction, and planning into a holistic, data-driven
framework. However, achieving robustness to varying camera viewpoints, a common
real-world challenge due to diverse vehicle configurations, remains an open
problem. In this work, we propose VR-Drive, a novel E2E-AD framework that
addresses viewpoint generalization by jointly learning 3D scene reconstruction
as an auxiliary task to enable planning-aware view synthesis. Unlike prior
scene-specific synthesis approaches, VR-Drive adopts a feed-forward inference
strategy that supports online training-time augmentation from sparse views
without additional annotations. To further improve viewpoint consistency, we
introduce a viewpoint-mixed memory bank that facilitates temporal interaction
across multiple viewpoints and a viewpoint-consistent distillation strategy
that transfers knowledge from original to synthesized views. Trained in a fully
end-to-end manner, VR-Drive effectively mitigates synthesis-induced noise and
improves planning under viewpoint shifts. In addition, we release a new
benchmark dataset to evaluate E2E-AD performance under novel camera viewpoints,
enabling comprehensive analysis. Our results demonstrate that VR-Drive is a
scalable and robust solution for the real-world deployment of end-to-end
autonomous driving systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全玻片图像检索的挑战，包括图像尺寸巨大、语义差异细微以及无关内容干扰等问题，为病理学家提供形态学和语义学上相似的病例检索，以支持精确诊断、提高观察一致性和辅助基于案例的教育。

Method: 提出PathSearch框架，统一细粒度注意力马赛克表示与通过视觉语言对比学习对齐的全局幻灯片嵌入，在6,926个幻灯片-报告对上进行训练，捕获细粒度形态学线索和高级语义模式。

Result: 在四个公共病理数据集和三个内部队列上评估，涵盖解剖部位检索、肿瘤亚型分类、肿瘤与非肿瘤区分以及分级等任务。PathSearch优于传统图像到图像检索框架，多中心阅读器研究显示其提高诊断准确性、增强信心并改善观察者间一致性。

Conclusion: PathSearch是一个可扩展且通用的数字病理学检索解决方案，能够有效支持临床诊断和教育工作。

Abstract: The rapid digitization of histopathology slides has opened up new
possibilities for computational tools in clinical and research workflows. Among
these, content-based slide retrieval stands out, enabling pathologists to
identify morphologically and semantically similar cases, thereby supporting
precise diagnoses, enhancing consistency across observers, and assisting
example-based education. However, effective retrieval of whole slide images
(WSIs) remains challenging due to their gigapixel scale and the difficulty of
capturing subtle semantic differences amid abundant irrelevant content. To
overcome these challenges, we present PathSearch, a retrieval framework that
unifies fine-grained attentive mosaic representations with global-wise slide
embeddings aligned through vision-language contrastive learning. Trained on a
corpus of 6,926 slide-report pairs, PathSearch captures both fine-grained
morphological cues and high-level semantic patterns to enable accurate and
flexible retrieval. The framework supports two key functionalities: (1)
mosaic-based image-to-image retrieval, ensuring accurate and efficient slide
research; and (2) multi-modal retrieval, where text queries can directly
retrieve relevant slides. PathSearch was rigorously evaluated on four public
pathology datasets and three in-house cohorts, covering tasks including
anatomical site retrieval, tumor subtyping, tumor vs. non-tumor discrimination,
and grading across diverse organs such as breast, lung, kidney, liver, and
stomach. External results show that PathSearch outperforms traditional
image-to-image retrieval frameworks. A multi-center reader study further
demonstrates that PathSearch improves diagnostic accuracy, boosts confidence,
and enhances inter-observer agreement among pathologists in real clinical
scenarios. These results establish PathSearch as a scalable and generalizable
retrieval solution for digital pathology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度伪造检测在现实场景中的挑战，特别是智能手机从数字屏幕拍摄时产生的摩尔纹伪影对检测结果的影响，这一问题此前未得到充分关注。

Method: 收集了12,832个视频的数据集，涵盖多种真实场景条件，并使用DeepMoiréFake数据集和两种合成摩尔纹生成技术进行实验，评估了15种顶级检测器的表现。

Result: 摩尔纹伪影使检测性能下降高达25.4%，合成生成的摩尔纹模式导致准确率下降21.4%，而去摩尔纹方法反而使准确率下降达17.2%。

Conclusion: 迫切需要开发能够稳健处理摩尔纹失真及其他现实挑战的检测模型，DMF数据集的引入旨在推动研究缩小受控实验与实际深度伪造检测之间的差距。

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a pressing challenge, particularly in real-world
settings where smartphone-captured media from digital screens often introduces
Moir\'e artifacts that can distort detection outcomes. This study
systematically evaluates state-of-the-art (SOTA) deepfake detectors on
Moir\'e-affected videos, an issue that has received little attention. We
collected a dataset of 12,832 videos, spanning 35.64 hours, from the Celeb-DF,
DFD, DFDC, UADFV, and FF++ datasets, capturing footage under diverse real-world
conditions, including varying screens, smartphones, lighting setups, and camera
angles. To further examine the influence of Moir\'e patterns on deepfake
detection, we conducted additional experiments using our DeepMoir\'eFake,
referred to as (DMF) dataset and two synthetic Moir\'e generation techniques.
Across 15 top-performing detectors, our results show that Moir\'e artifacts
degrade performance by as much as 25.4%, while synthetically generated Moir\'e
patterns lead to a 21.4% drop in accuracy. Surprisingly, demoir\'eing methods,
intended as a mitigation approach, instead worsened the problem, reducing
accuracy by up to 17.2%. These findings underscore the urgent need for
detection models that can robustly handle Moir\'e distortions alongside other
realworld challenges, such as compression, sharpening, and blurring. By
introducing the DMF dataset, we aim to drive future research toward closing the
gap between controlled experiments and practical deepfake detection.

<details>

Motivation: 现有自回归Transformer方法在手写文本生成中存在需要额外输入、缺乏停止机制、产生重复循环和视觉伪影等问题，需要改进内容可控性。

Method: 将HTG构建为多模态提示条件生成任务，引入特殊文本输入标记以更好地与视觉标记对齐，并设计基于Classifier-Free-Guidance的自回归模型策略。

Result: 相比先前方案，Eruku需要更少输入，对未见风格泛化能力更强，能更忠实地遵循文本提示，改善了内容一致性。

Conclusion: Eruku方法通过重新构建问题框架和改进模型设计，在手写文本生成任务中实现了更好的内容可控性和生成质量。

Abstract: Generating faithful and readable styled text images (especially for Styled
Handwritten Text generation - HTG) is an open problem with several possible
applications across graphic design, document understanding, and image editing.
A lot of research effort in this task is dedicated to developing strategies
that reproduce the stylistic characteristics of a given writer, with promising
results in terms of style fidelity and generalization achieved by the recently
proposed Autoregressive Transformer paradigm for HTG. However, this method
requires additional inputs, lacks a proper stop mechanism, and might end up in
repetition loops, generating visual artifacts. In this work, we rethink the
autoregressive formulation by framing HTG as a multimodal prompt-conditioned
generation task, and tackle the content controllability issues by introducing
special textual input tokens for better alignment with the visual ones.
Moreover, we devise a Classifier-Free-Guidance-based strategy for our
autoregressive model. Through extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate
that our approach, dubbed Eruku, compared to previous solutions requires fewer
inputs, generalizes better to unseen styles, and follows more faithfully the
textual prompt, improving content adherence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统固定补丁大小采样在3D医学图像分割中存在的类别不平衡问题，并提高训练效率。

Method: 在模型训练过程中逐步增加补丁大小，设计了资源高效模式和性能模式两种设置。

Result: 资源高效模式将训练时间减少到44%的同时保持相同Dice分数性能；性能模式在减少训练时间到89%的同时，Dice分数相对平均提升1.28%。

Conclusion: 这种简单而优雅的数据变换方法显著提高了分割性能和训练效率，且适用于多种分割架构。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Progressive Growing of Patch Size, an automatic
curriculum learning approach for 3D medical image segmentation. Our approach
progressively increases the patch size during model training, resulting in an
improved class balance for smaller patch sizes and accelerated convergence of
the training process. We evaluate our curriculum approach in two settings: a
resource-efficient mode and a performance mode, both regarding Dice score
performance and computational costs across 15 diverse and popular 3D medical
image segmentation tasks. The resource-efficient mode matches the Dice score
performance of the conventional constant patch size sampling baseline with a
notable reduction in training time to only 44%. The performance mode improves
upon constant patch size segmentation results, achieving a statistically
significant relative mean performance gain of 1.28% in Dice Score. Remarkably,
across all 15 tasks, our proposed performance mode manages to surpass the
constant patch size baseline in Dice Score performance, while simultaneously
reducing training time to only 89%. The benefits are particularly pronounced
for highly imbalanced tasks such as lesion segmentation tasks. Rigorous
experiments demonstrate that our performance mode not only improves mean
segmentation performance but also reduces performance variance, yielding more
trustworthy model comparison. Furthermore, our findings reveal that the
proposed curriculum sampling is not tied to a specific architecture but
represents a broadly applicable strategy that consistently boosts performance
across diverse segmentation models, including UNet, UNETR, and SwinUNETR. In
summary, we show that this simple yet elegant transformation on input data
substantially improves both Dice Score performance and training runtime, while
being compatible across diverse segmentation backbones.

Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在视频问答中的广泛应用，需要评估多模态模型的复杂性和方向正确性，特别是解决文本主导问题和探索模态间交互。

Method: 使用Shapley值计算特征归因和模态评分，将视频帧和文本元素视为平等特征，将多选题VQA任务视为视频、问题和答案三个模态的交互。

Result: 结果显示模型对文本有依赖性，多选题VQA任务退化为模型忽略干扰项的能力。

Conclusion: 当前VLM模型存在文本主导问题，需要更平衡的多模态交互评估方法。

Abstract: As we become increasingly dependent on vision language models (VLMs) to
answer questions about the world around us, there is a significant amount of
research devoted to increasing both the difficulty of video question answering
(VQA) datasets, and the context lengths of the models that they evaluate. The
reliance on large language models as backbones has lead to concerns about
potential text dominance, and the exploration of interactions between
modalities is underdeveloped. How do we measure whether we're heading in the
right direction, with the complexity that multi-modal models introduce? We
propose a joint method of computing both feature attributions and modality
scores based on Shapley values, where both the features and modalities are
arbitrarily definable. Using these metrics, we compare $6$ VLM models of
varying context lengths on $4$ representative datasets, focusing on
multiple-choice VQA. In particular, we consider video frames and whole textual
elements as equal features in the hierarchy, and the multiple-choice VQA task
as an interaction between three modalities: video, question and answer. Our
results demonstrate a dependence on text and show that the multiple-choice VQA
task devolves into a model's ability to ignore distractors. Code available at

Result: 模型成功处理现实世界物体的内在层次结构，相比传统平面分类算法表现更优，能够更好地利用对象间关系。

Conclusion: 所提出的分层方法能够有效捕捉现实世界物体的层次结构，为图像分类任务提供了更好的上下文理解和错误控制能力。

Abstract: Current convolution neural network (CNN) classification methods are
predominantly focused on flat classification which aims solely to identify a
specified object within an image. However, real-world objects often possess a
natural hierarchical organization that can significantly help classification
tasks. Capturing the presence of relations between objects enables better
contextual understanding as well as control over the severity of mistakes.
Considering these aspects, this paper proposes an end-to-end hierarchical model
for image detection and classification built upon the YOLO model family. A
novel hierarchical architecture, a modified loss function, and a performance
metric tailored to the hierarchical nature of the model are introduced. The
proposed model is trained and evaluated on two different hierarchical
categorizations of the same dataset: a systematic categorization that
disregards visual similarities between objects and a categorization accounting
for common visual characteristics across classes. The results illustrate how
the suggested methodology addresses the inherent hierarchical structure present
in real-world objects, which conventional flat classification algorithms often
overlook.

Motivation: 基于ODE和SDE的求解器各有弱点：ODE求解器沿确定性轨迹积累不可约梯度误差，而SDE方法在步数预算有限时遭受放大的离散化误差。

Method: 引入AdaSDE，单步SDE求解器，通过轻量级蒸馏估计每步可学习系数，动态调节误差修正强度以加速扩散采样，可与现有求解器集成。

Conclusion: AdaSDE成功统一了ODE的效率和SDE的误差弹性，为扩散采样提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative processes, formulated as differential equation
solving, frequently balance computational speed with sample quality. Our
theoretical investigation of ODE- and SDE-based solvers reveals complementary
weaknesses: ODE solvers accumulate irreducible gradient error along
deterministic trajectories, while SDE methods suffer from amplified
discretization errors when the step budget is limited. Building upon this
insight, we introduce AdaSDE, a novel single-step SDE solver that aims to unify
the efficiency of ODEs with the error resilience of SDEs. Specifically, we
introduce a single per-step learnable coefficient, estimated via lightweight
distillation, which dynamically regulates the error correction strength to
accelerate diffusion sampling. Notably, our framework can be integrated with
existing solvers to enhance their capabilities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance: at 5 NFE, AdaSDE achieves FID scores
of 4.18 on CIFAR-10, 8.05 on FFHQ and 6.96 on LSUN Bedroom. Codes are available

Motivation: 现有讽刺检测方法主要关注单图像场景，忽略了多图像之间的语义和情感关系，无法有效建模现实世界中由多图像线索触发的讽刺情况。

Method: 提出跨图像推理模型(CIRM)，进行针对性跨图像序列建模以捕捉潜在图像间联系，并引入基于文本-图像对应关系的相关性引导细粒度跨模态融合机制。

Result: MMSD3.0是一个有效可靠的基准，更好地反映了现实条件；CIRM在MMSD、MMSD2.0和MMSD3.0数据集上都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CIRM模型在单图像和多图像讽刺检测场景中都表现出有效性，填补了多图像讽刺检测的研究空白。

Abstract: Despite progress in multimodal sarcasm detection, existing datasets and
methods predominantly focus on single-image scenarios, overlooking potential
semantic and affective relations across multiple images. This leaves a gap in
modeling cases where sarcasm is triggered by multi-image cues in real-world
settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMSD3.0, a new benchmark composed
entirely of multi-image samples curated from tweets and Amazon reviews. We
further propose the Cross-Image Reasoning Model (CIRM), which performs targeted
cross-image sequence modeling to capture latent inter-image connections. In
addition, we introduce a relevance-guided, fine-grained cross-modal fusion
mechanism based on text-image correspondence to reduce information loss during
integration. We establish a comprehensive suite of strong and representative
baselines and conduct extensive experiments, showing that MMSD3.0 is an
effective and reliable benchmark that better reflects real-world conditions.
Moreover, CIRM demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across MMSD, MMSD2.0
and MMSD3.0, validating its effectiveness in both single-image and multi-image
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MDReID是一个灵活的任意模态到任意模态的图像级重识别框架，通过解耦模态共享特征和模态特定特征，在模态匹配和不匹配场景下都能有效工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的重识别系统经常面临模态不一致问题，查询图像和库图像可能来自不同传感器（如RGB、NIR、TIR），但现有方法大多假设模态匹配条件，限制了实际应用中的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Method: 提出MDReID框架，包含两个关键组件：模态解耦学习（MDL）显式将模态特征分解为模态共享和模态特定表示；模态感知度量学习（MML）通过正交性和互补性增强跨模态判别能力。

Result: 在三个多模态重识别基准测试（RGBNT201、RGBNT100、MSVR310）上，MDReID在模态匹配场景下分别获得9.8%、3.0%、11.5%的mAP提升，在模态不匹配场景下平均获得3.4%、11.8%、10.9%的增益。

Conclusion: MDReID通过有效解耦模态特征，显著提升了多模态重识别系统在现实场景中的性能，特别是在模态不匹配条件下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Real-world object re-identification (ReID) systems often face modality
inconsistencies, where query and gallery images come from different sensors
(e.g., RGB, NIR, TIR). However, most existing methods assume modality-matched
conditions, which limits their robustness and scalability in practical
applications. To address this challenge, we propose MDReID, a flexible
any-to-any image-level ReID framework designed to operate under both
modality-matched and modality-mismatched scenarios. MDReID builds on the
insight that modality information can be decomposed into two components:
modality-shared features that are predictable and transferable, and
modality-specific features that capture unique, modality-dependent
characteristics. To effectively leverage this, MDReID introduces two key
components: the Modality Decoupling Learning (MDL) and Modality-aware Metric
Learning (MML). Specifically, MDL explicitly decomposes modality features into
modality-shared and modality-specific representations, enabling effective
retrieval in both modality-aligned and mismatched scenarios. MML, a tailored
metric learning strategy, further enforces orthogonality and complementarity
between the two components to enhance discriminative power across modalities.
Extensive experiments conducted on three challenging multi-modality ReID
benchmarks (RGBNT201, RGBNT100, MSVR310) consistently demonstrate the
superiority of MDReID. Notably, MDReID achieves significant mAP improvements of
9.8\%, 3.0\%, and 11.5\% in general modality-matched scenarios, and average
gains of 3.4\%, 11.8\%, and 10.9\% in modality-mismatched scenarios,
respectively. The code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ReconViaGen方法，通过将重建先验整合到生成框架中，解决多视图3D重建中因遮挡和稀疏覆盖导致的完整性问题，实现与输入视图一致的完整准确3D模型重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于多视图的3D重建方法严重依赖输入视图之间的充分重叠，实践中经常因遮挡和稀疏覆盖导致重建不完整。虽然基于扩散的3D生成技术可以通过学习生成先验来补全不可见部分，但其随机性限制了生成结果的准确性和可靠性。

Method: 提出ReconViaGen方法，分析扩散基3D生成方法一致性不足的原因：(a)在提取多视图图像特征作为条件时构建和利用跨视图连接的不足；(b)局部细节生成中迭代去噪的差可控性导致与输入不一致的几何和纹理细节。通过将重建先验整合到生成框架中，并设计相应策略解决这些问题。

Result: 大量实验表明，ReconViaGen能够在全局结构和局部细节上重建与输入视图一致的完整且准确的3D模型。

Conclusion: ReconViaGen成功解决了多视图3D重建中的完整性问题，通过整合重建先验到生成框架，实现了高一致性的3D模型重建。

Abstract: Existing multi-view 3D object reconstruction methods heavily rely on
sufficient overlap between input views, where occlusions and sparse coverage in
practice frequently yield severe reconstruction incompleteness. Recent
advancements in diffusion-based 3D generative techniques offer the potential to
address these limitations by leveraging learned generative priors to
hallucinate invisible parts of objects, thereby generating plausible 3D
structures. However, the stochastic nature of the inference process limits the
accuracy and reliability of generation results, preventing existing
reconstruction frameworks from integrating such 3D generative priors. In this
work, we comprehensively analyze the reasons why diffusion-based 3D generative
methods fail to achieve high consistency, including (a) the insufficiency in
constructing and leveraging cross-view connections when extracting multi-view
image features as conditions, and (b) the poor controllability of iterative
denoising during local detail generation, which easily leads to plausible but
inconsistent fine geometric and texture details with inputs. Accordingly, we
propose ReconViaGen to innovatively integrate reconstruction priors into the
generative framework and devise several strategies that effectively address
these issues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ReconViaGen can
reconstruct complete and accurate 3D models consistent with input views in both
global structure and local details.Project page:

Abstract: This thesis works to address a pivotal challenge in medical image analysis:
the reliance on extensive labeled datasets, which are often limited due to the
need for expert annotation and constrained by privacy and legal issues. By
focusing on the development of self-supervised learning techniques and domain
adaptation methods, this research aims to circumvent these limitations,
presenting a novel approach to enhance the utility and efficacy of deep

3D MRIs, thus mitigating the dependency on large labeled datasets.
  Further, the thesis explores the current state of self-supervised learning in
medical imaging. It introduces novel pretext tasks that are capable of
extracting meaningful information from unlabeled data, significantly advancing

We address classification of paclitaxel (Taxol) exposure from phase-contrast
microscopy of C6 glioma cells -- a task with subtle dose differences that
challenges full-image models. We propose a simple tiling-and-aggregation
pipeline that operates on local patches and combines tile outputs into an image
label, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the benchmark dataset and
improving over the published baseline by around 20 percentage points, with
trends confirmed by cross-validation. To understand why tiling is effective, we
further apply Grad-CAM and Score-CAM and attention analyses, which enhance
model interpretability and point toward robustness-oriented directions for
future medical image research. Code is released to facilitate reproduction and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PlanarTrack，一个用于平面跟踪的大规模高质量基准数据集，包含1,150个序列、超过733K帧，支持短期和长期跟踪性能评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平面跟踪在机器人和增强现实中具有重要作用，但在深度学习时代缺乏大规模平台限制了其发展。

Method: 构建了一个包含1,150个序列的大规模数据集，所有视频在无约束条件下录制，每个视频帧通过四角点手动标注，并经过多轮细致检查和精炼。

Result: 评估了10个代表性平面跟踪器，发现顶级跟踪器在具有挑战性的PlanarTrack上性能显著下降。

Conclusion: PlanarTrack是目前最大、最多样化和最具挑战性的平面跟踪数据集，表明需要更多努力来改进平面跟踪性能。

Abstract: Planar tracking has drawn increasing interest owing to its key roles in
robotics and augmented reality. Despite recent great advancement, further
development of planar tracking, particularly in the deep learning era, is
largely limited compared to generic tracking due to the lack of large-scale
platforms. To mitigate this, we propose PlanarTrack, a large-scale high-quality
and challenging benchmark for planar tracking. Specifically, PlanarTrack
consists of 1,150 sequences with over 733K frames, including 1,000 short-term
and 150 new long-term videos, which enables comprehensive evaluation of short-
and long-term tracking performance. All videos in PlanarTrack are recorded in
unconstrained conditions from the wild, which makes PlanarTrack challenging but
more realistic for real-world applications. To ensure high-quality annotations,
each video frame is manually annotated by four corner points with multi-round
meticulous inspection and refinement. To enhance target diversity of
PlanarTrack, we only capture a unique target in one sequence, which is
different from existing benchmarks. To our best knowledge, PlanarTrack is by
far the largest and most diverse and challenging dataset dedicated to planar
tracking. To understand performance of existing methods on PlanarTrack and to
provide a comparison for future research, we evaluate 10 representative planar
trackers with extensive comparison and in-depth analysis. Our evaluation
reveals that, unsurprisingly, the top planar trackers heavily degrade on the
challenging PlanarTrack, which indicates more efforts are required for
improving planar tracking. Our data and results will be released at

*Songxi Yang,Tang Sui,Qunying Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出LSSR框架用于遥感图像超分辨率，基于预训练的Stable Diffusion，结合多模态辅助信息（DEM、土地覆盖、月份、SAR）和傅里叶NDVI损失，在保持高效推理的同时显著提升作物边界恢复和分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前扩散模型在遥感超分辨率中训练成本高、推理慢、辅助信息利用不足以及缺乏下游任务评估的问题。

Method: 基于冻结预训练的Stable Diffusion，集成跨模态注意力机制，利用DEM、土地覆盖、月份和SAR等辅助信息，通过适配器和定制傅里叶NDVI损失平衡空间细节和光谱保真度。

Result: 在RGB和IR通道上分别达到PSNR/SSIM为32.63/0.84和23.99/0.78，NDVI均方误差最低（0.042），推理速度0.39秒/图像，在作物分类任务中F1分数达0.86，优于Sentinel-2的0.85。

Conclusion: LSSR框架展示了遥感超分辨率在精准农业中的潜力，实现了高效、准确的图像重建和下游任务性能提升。

Abstract: Super resolution offers a way to harness medium even lowresolution but
historically valuable remote sensing image archives. Generative models,
especially diffusion models, have recently been applied to remote sensing super
resolution (RSSR), yet several challenges exist. First, diffusion models are
effective but require expensive training from scratch resources and have slow
inference speeds. Second, current methods have limited utilization of auxiliary
information as real-world constraints to reconstruct scientifically realistic
images. Finally, most current methods lack evaluation on downstream tasks. In
this study, we present a efficient LSSR framework for RSSR, supported by a new
multimodal dataset of paired 30 m Landsat 8 and 10 m Sentinel 2 imagery. Built
on frozen pretrained Stable Diffusion, LSSR integrates crossmodal attention
with auxiliary knowledge (Digital Elevation Model, land cover, month) and
Synthetic Aperture Radar guidance, enhanced by adapters and a tailored Fourier
NDVI loss to balance spatial details and spectral fidelity. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that LSSR significantly improves crop boundary
delineation and recovery, achieving state-of-the-art performance with Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio/Structural Similarity Index Measure of 32.63/0.84 (RGB)
and 23.99/0.78 (IR), and the lowest NDVI Mean Squared Error (0.042), while
maintaining efficient inference (0.39 sec/image). Moreover, LSSR transfers
effectively to NASA Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel (HLS) super resolution,
yielding more reliable crop classification (F1: 0.86) than Sentinel-2 (F1:
0.85). These results highlight the potential of RSSR to advance precision
agriculture.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoTG-R1是一个用于视频时间定位的课程强化学习框架，通过边界反射代理过滤部分标注样本，通过难度估计代理设计课程学习策略，仅使用10%训练数据和21%计算预算就能超越全数据方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在视频时间定位任务中忽视了训练样本质量和难度带来的挑战：部分标注样本存在标注区间外的相关片段导致模糊监督，难以定位样本在强化学习训练中产生低且不可区分的奖励信号，阻碍学习效率。

Method: 提出VideoTG-R1框架，包含边界反射代理（利用MLLM预测标注区间外的相关时间戳来识别和过滤部分标注样本）和难度估计代理（评估样本训练难度并设计课程RL策略，动态屏蔽难以定位样本的视频内容）。

Result: 在VTG和基于视频的问答任务上验证了方法的有效性，仅使用10%训练样本和21%计算预算，在GRPO和SFT设置下均优于全数据对应方法。

Conclusion: VideoTG-R1通过解决部分标注和难以定位样本的问题，实现了数据高效的视频时间定位训练，显著提升了训练效率和性能。

Abstract: Video temporal grounding (VTG) aims to locate precise segments in videos
based on language queries, which is a fundamental challenge in video
understanding. While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown
promise in tackling VTG through reinforcement learning (RL), they overlook the
challenges arising from both the quality and difficulty of training samples.
(1) Partially annotated samples. Many samples contain relevant segments beyond
the annotated interval, introducing ambiguous supervision. (2) Hard-to-ground
samples. Samples with poor zero-shot performance produce consistently low and
indistinguishable rewards during RL training, exhibiting no clear preference
among multiple outputs and thus hindering learning efficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose VideoTG-R1, a novel curriculum RL framework with
reflected boundary annotations, enabling data-efficient training. Specifically,
we propose a Boundary Reflection Agent that utilizes MLLMs to predict
query-relevant timestamps outside the annotated intervals, allowing us to
identify and filter out partially annotated samples, thereby reducing
ambiguity. Furthermore, we introduce a Difficulty Estimation Agent to assess
the training difficulty of each sample and design a curriculum RL strategy that
dynamically masks the videos of hard-to-ground samples according to the
training steps, easing the training difficulty and providing clearer
preference. Experiments on the VTG and grounded VideoQA tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. Remarkably, with only 10% of the training samples
and 21% of the computational budget, VideoTG-R1 outperforms full-data
counterparts under both group relative policy optimization (GRPO) and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT). The code is available at
https://github.com/ldong1111/VideoTG-R1.

limitations in some frequency bands and the color cast problem caused by
insufficient input dimension. We construct two optimization schemes and combine
them, which achieves the performance improvement of indicators such as PSNR and
SSIM of the images after DDColor.

Conclusion: Symmetria数据集具有公开可用性、代码配套和生成大规模集合的能力，促进了点云学习的进一步研究和创新。

Abstract: Unlike image or text domains that benefit from an abundance of large-scale
datasets, point cloud learning techniques frequently encounter limitations due
to the scarcity of extensive datasets. To overcome this limitation, we present
Symmetria, a formula-driven dataset that can be generated at any arbitrary
scale. By construction, it ensures the absolute availability of precise ground
truth, promotes data-efficient experimentation by requiring fewer samples,
enables broad generalization across diverse geometric settings, and offers easy
extensibility to new tasks and modalities. Using the concept of symmetry, we
create shapes with known structure and high variability, enabling neural
networks to learn point cloud features effectively. Our results demonstrate
that this dataset is highly effective for point cloud self-supervised
pre-training, yielding models with strong performance in downstream tasks such
as classification and segmentation, which also show good few-shot learning
capabilities. Additionally, our dataset can support fine-tuning models to
classify real-world objects, highlighting our approach's practical utility and
application. We also introduce a challenging task for symmetry detection and
provide a benchmark for baseline comparisons. A significant advantage of our
approach is the public availability of the dataset, the accompanying code, and
the ability to generate very large collections, promoting further research and
innovation in point cloud learning.

Abstract: Foundation models in artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming medical
imaging by enabling general-purpose feature learning from large-scale,
unlabeled datasets. In this work, we introduce BrainFound, a self-supervised
foundation model for brain MRI, built by extending DINO-v2, a vision
transformer originally designed for 2D natural images. BrainFound adapts
DINO-v2 to model full 3D brain anatomy by incorporating volumetric information
from sequential MRI slices, moving beyond conventional single-slice paradigms.
It supports both single- and multimodal inputs, enabling a broad range of
downstream tasks, including disease detection and image segmentation, while
generalising across varied imaging protocols and clinical scenarios. We show
that BrainFound consistently outperforms existing self-supervised pretraining
strategies and supervised baselines, particularly in label-scarce and
multi-contrast settings. By integrating information from diverse 3D MRI
modalities (e.g., T1, T2, FLAIR), it enhances diagnostic accuracy and reduces
dependency on extensive expert annotations. This flexibility makes BrainFound a
scalable and practical solution for 3D neuroimaging pipelines, with significant

Abstract: This study presents a novel workflow designed to efficiently and accurately
register large-scale mobile laser scanning (MLS) point clouds to a target model
point cloud in urban street scenarios. This workflow specifically targets the
complexities inherent in urban environments and adeptly addresses the
challenges of integrating point clouds that vary in density, noise
characteristics, and occlusion scenarios, which are common in bustling city
centers. Two methodological advancements are introduced. First, the proposed
Semi-sphere Check (SSC) preprocessing technique optimally fragments MLS
trajectory data by identifying mutually orthogonal planar surfaces. This step
reduces the impact of MLS drift on the accuracy of the entire point cloud
registration, while ensuring sufficient geometric features within each fragment
to avoid local minima. Second, we propose Planar Voxel-based Generalized
Iterative Closest Point (PV-GICP), a fine registration method that selectively
utilizes planar surfaces within voxel partitions. This pre-process strategy not
only improves registration accuracy but also reduces computation time by more
than 50% compared to conventional point-to-plane ICP methods. Experiments on
real-world datasets from Munich's inner city demonstrate that our workflow
achieves sub-0.01 m average registration accuracy while significantly
shortening processing times. The results underscore the potential of the
proposed methods to advance automated 3D urban modeling and updating, with
direct applications in urban planning, infrastructure management, and dynamic
city monitoring.

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了草图约束的直接整合，为CAD逆向工程提供了更有效的解决方案，重建的模型具有更好的可编辑性和细节保留能力。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a foundational role in modern manufacturing
and product development, often requiring designers to modify or build upon
existing models. Converting 3D scans into parametric CAD representations--a
process known as CAD reverse engineering--remains a significant challenge due
to the high precision and structural complexity of CAD models. Existing deep
learning-based approaches typically fall into two categories: bottom-up,
geometry-driven methods, which often fail to produce fully parametric outputs,
and top-down strategies, which tend to overlook fine-grained geometric details.
Moreover, current methods neglect an essential aspect of CAD modeling:
sketch-level constraints. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to CAD
reverse engineering inspired by how human designers manually perform the task.
Our method leverages multi-plane cross-sections to extract 2D patterns and
capture fine parametric details more effectively. It enables the reconstruction
of detailed and editable CAD models, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
and, for the first time, incorporating sketch constraints directly into the
reconstruction process.

Conclusion: CURVETE模型能有效提升医学图像分类性能，特别是在样本有限和类别分布不均衡的情况下，证明了课程学习和自监督训练的有效性。

Abstract: Identifying high-quality and easily accessible annotated samples poses a
notable challenge in medical image analysis. Transfer learning techniques,
leveraging pre-training data, offer a flexible solution to this issue. However,
the impact of fine-tuning diminishes when the dataset exhibits an irregular
distribution between classes. This paper introduces a novel deep convolutional
neural network, named Curriculum Learning and Progressive Self-supervised
Training (CURVETE). CURVETE addresses challenges related to limited samples,
enhances model generalisability, and improves overall classification
performance. It achieves this by employing a curriculum learning strategy based
on the granularity of sample decomposition during the training of generic
unlabelled samples. Moreover, CURVETE address the challenge of irregular class
distribution by incorporating a class decomposition approach in the downstream
task. The proposed method undergoes evaluation on three distinct medical image
datasets: brain tumour, digital knee x-ray, and Mini-DDSM datasets. We
investigate the classification performance using a generic self-supervised
sample decomposition approach with and without the curriculum learning
component in training the pretext task. Experimental results demonstrate that
the CURVETE model achieves superior performance on test sets with an accuracy
of 96.60% on the brain tumour dataset, 75.60% on the digital knee x-ray
dataset, and 93.35% on the Mini-DDSM dataset using the baseline ResNet-50.
Furthermore, with the baseline DenseNet-121, it achieved accuracies of 95.77%,
80.36%, and 93.22% on the brain tumour, digital knee x-ray, and Mini-DDSM
datasets, respectively, outperforming other training strategies.

TL;DR: 提出FRBNet，一种基于频域通道比的可学习滤波器模块，用于提取光照不变特征，提升低光条件下计算机视觉任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对低光条件建模不完整，导致下游任务性能受限。需要重新审视低光图像形成机制，从频域角度解决光照退化问题。

Method: 扩展经典Lambertian模型，在频域中利用通道比提取光照不变特征，设计可端到端训练的FRBNet模块，包含频域通道比操作和可学习滤波器。

Conclusion: FRBNet作为即插即用模块，无需修改损失函数即可集成到现有网络中，有效提升低光视觉任务的性能。

Abstract: Low-light vision remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision due to
severe illumination degradation, which significantly affects the performance of
downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation. While recent
state-of-the-art methods have improved performance through invariant feature
learning modules, they still fall short due to incomplete modeling of low-light
conditions. Therefore, we revisit low-light image formation and extend the
classical Lambertian model to better characterize low-light conditions. By
shifting our analysis to the frequency domain, we theoretically prove that the
frequency-domain channel ratio can be leveraged to extract
illumination-invariant features via a structured filtering process. We then
propose a novel and end-to-end trainable module named \textbf{F}requency-domain
\textbf{R}adial \textbf{B}asis \textbf{Net}work (\textbf{FRBNet}), which
integrates the frequency-domain channel ratio operation with a learnable
frequency domain filter for the overall illumination-invariant feature
enhancement. As a plug-and-play module, FRBNet can be integrated into existing
networks for low-light downstream tasks without modifying loss functions.
Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks demonstrate that FRBNet

TL;DR: Video-Thinker扩展了"图像思维"范式到视频推理，让多模态大语言模型能够自主利用其内在的"定位"和"描述"能力生成推理线索，无需外部工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的"图像思维"动态推理范式在视频推理任务中尚未得到应用，需要开发能够自主进行视频推理的方法。

Method: 构建Video-Thinker-10K数据集，采用监督微调学习推理格式，然后使用组相对策略优化强化推理能力。

Result: Video-Thinker在多个视频推理基准测试中显著优于现有基线，Video-Thinker-7B在7B规模MLLMs中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将动态推理范式扩展到视频领域，实现了无需外部工具的自主视频推理能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in image reasoning methods, particularly "Thinking with
Images", have demonstrated remarkable success in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs); however, this dynamic reasoning paradigm has not yet been
extended to video reasoning tasks. In this paper, we propose Video-Thinker,
which empowers MLLMs to think with videos by autonomously leveraging their
intrinsic "grounding" and "captioning" capabilities to generate reasoning clues
throughout the inference process. To spark this capability, we construct
Video-Thinker-10K, a curated dataset featuring autonomous tool usage within
chain-of-thought reasoning sequences. Our training strategy begins with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to learn the reasoning format, followed by Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen this reasoning capability.
Through this approach, Video-Thinker enables MLLMs to autonomously navigate
grounding and captioning tasks for video reasoning, eliminating the need for
constructing and calling external tools. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Video-Thinker achieves significant performance gains on both in-domain tasks
and challenging out-of-domain video reasoning benchmarks, including
Video-Holmes, CG-Bench-Reasoning, and VRBench. Our Video-Thinker-7B
substantially outperforms existing baselines such as Video-R1 and establishes
state-of-the-art performance among 7B-sized MLLMs.

*Karthikeyan Chandra Sekaran,Markus Geisler,Dominik Rößle,Adithya Mohan,Daniel Cremers,Wolfgang Utschick,Michael Botsch,Werner Huber,Torsten Schön*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UrbanIng-V2X是首个大规模多模态数据集，支持车辆和基础设施传感器在三个城市交叉路口的协同感知，包含34个时间对齐和空间校准的传感器序列，提供丰富的多模态数据和3D标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有真实世界数据集通常局限于单一交叉路口或单一车辆，缺乏多车辆和多基础设施传感器的综合感知数据集，导致算法在多样化交通环境中评估受限，容易过拟合。

Method: 在德国英戈尔施塔特的三个城市交叉路口部署传感器，收集包含2辆车和最多3个基础设施传感器杆的协调场景数据，提供12个车载RGB相机、2个车载LiDAR、17个基础设施热成像相机和12个基础设施LiDAR的数据。

Result: 数据集包含34个20秒的传感器序列，以10Hz频率标注13个对象类别的3D边界框，总计约712k个标注实例，提供了全面的协同感知方法评估。

Conclusion: UrbanIng-V2X填补了多车辆和多基础设施传感器协同感知数据集的空白，为算法在多样化交通环境中的基准测试提供了重要资源，并公开了代码库、数据集、高清地图和数据收集环境的数字孪生。

Abstract: Recent cooperative perception datasets have played a crucial role in
advancing smart mobility applications by enabling information exchange between
intelligent agents, helping to overcome challenges such as occlusions and
improving overall scene understanding. While some existing real-world datasets
incorporate both vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure interactions,
they are typically limited to a single intersection or a single vehicle. A
comprehensive perception dataset featuring multiple connected vehicles and
infrastructure sensors across several intersections remains unavailable,
limiting the benchmarking of algorithms in diverse traffic environments.
Consequently, overfitting can occur, and models may demonstrate misleadingly
high performance due to similar intersection layouts and traffic participant
behavior. To address this gap, we introduce UrbanIng-V2X, the first
large-scale, multi-modal dataset supporting cooperative perception involving
vehicles and infrastructure sensors deployed across three urban intersections
in Ingolstadt, Germany. UrbanIng-V2X consists of 34 temporally aligned and
spatially calibrated sensor sequences, each lasting 20 seconds. All sequences
contain recordings from one of three intersections, involving two vehicles and
up to three infrastructure-mounted sensor poles operating in coordinated
scenarios. In total, UrbanIng-V2X provides data from 12 vehicle-mounted RGB
cameras, 2 vehicle LiDARs, 17 infrastructure thermal cameras, and 12
infrastructure LiDARs. All sequences are annotated at a frequency of 10 Hz with
3D bounding boxes spanning 13 object classes, resulting in approximately 712k
annotated instances across the dataset. We provide comprehensive evaluations
using state-of-the-art cooperative perception methods and publicly release the
codebase, dataset, HD map, and a digital twin of the complete data collection
environment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MergeMix是一种训练时增强范式，通过注意力感知的图像混合和偏好驱动训练，在监督微调和强化学习之间架起桥梁，提升多模态大语言模型的视觉-语言对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在权衡：监督微调(SFT)稳定高效但需要大量人工标注且无法捕捉细微偏好；强化学习(RL)能引入奖励信号但存在开销和不稳定性问题。需要解决可扩展性、鲁棒性和对齐质量之间的平衡问题。

Method: 1) 通过token合并实现注意力感知的图像混合，提供更多聚类表示和空间上下文；2) 构建混合图像与原始图像的偏好对，使用SimPO损失进行优化；3) 作为mixup增强方法，提升注意力一致性和效率。

Result: MergeMix在分类任务中超越了其他基于启发式的方法，实现了具有竞争力的准确率和改进的效率，为分类和多模态大语言模型中的偏好对齐提供了可扩展的方法。

Conclusion: MergeMix通过桥接SFT和RL，提供了一种有效的训练时增强范式，能够在保持效率的同时提升多模态大语言模型的视觉-语言对齐质量。

Abstract: Vision-language alignment in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs)
typically relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning
(RL). SFT is stable and efficient but requires large-scale human annotations
and cannot capture subtle preferences, while RL brings in a reward signal for
training, but suffers from overhead and instability. These limitations
highlight a trade-off between scalability, robustness, and alignment quality.
To address this, we propose MergeMix, a training-time augmentation paradigm
that bridges SFT and RL. It first applies an attention-aware image mixing via
token merge with more cluster representation and spatial context, and then
presents a preference-driven training paradigm for MLLMs by building preference
pairs with mixed images and raw images, and optimizing via SimPO loss. As a
mixup augmentation, MergeMix enhances attention consistency and efficiency,
surpassing other heuristic-based methods in classification. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MergeMix achieves competitive accuracy with
improved efficiency, providing a scalable approach to preference alignment in
classification and MLLMs.

*Zujing Liu,Junwen Pan,Qi She,Yuan Gao,Guisong Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文发现大型视觉语言模型生成的视觉-文本多模态思维链存在视觉信息不准确的问题，提出了SCCM学习策略来提升视觉信息的可靠性和充分性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型视觉语言模型生成的多模态思维链中，视觉信息经常不准确但模型仍能给出正确答案，表明推理过程缺乏忠实性。这源于强化微调中的奖励机制只鼓励视觉-文本交替格式，而不考虑视觉信息的正确性。

Method: 提出SCCM学习策略，鼓励模型生成充分但最小的视觉组件，这些组件能够独立导致正确答案。该方法无需人工标注，可与各种强化微调方法即插即用。

Result: 实验结果表明，SCCM在一系列细粒度感知和推理基准测试中持续提升了视觉忠实性。

Conclusion: SCCM方法有效解决了多模态思维链中视觉信息不忠实的问题，提高了推理过程的可信度。

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) can generate vision-text
multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) traces after reinforcement fine-tuning
(RFT). However, we observe that the visual information incorporated in MCoT is
often inaccurate, though still yield correct answers, indicating a lack of
faithfulness in the MCoT reasoning process. We attribute this unfaithfulness to
the RL reward in RFT, which solely incentivizes the format of interleaved
vision-text cues, ie, it encourages the model to incorporate visual information
into its text reasoning steps without considering the correctness of the visual
information. In this paper, we first probe the faithfulness of MCoT by
measuring how much the prediction changes when its visual and textual thoughts
are intervened. Surprisingly, the model's predictions remain nearly unchanged
under visual intervention but change significantly under textual intervention,
indicating that the visual evidence is largely ignored. To further analyze
visual information, we introduce an automated LVLM-based evaluation metric that
quantifies the faithfulness of visual cues from two perspectives: reliability
and sufficiency. Our evaluation reveals that the visual information in current
MCoT traces is simultaneously unreliable and insufficient. To address this
issue, we propose a novel MCoT learning strategy termed Sufficient-Component
Cause Model (SCCM) learning. This approach encourages the MCoT to generate
sufficient yet minimal visual components that are independently capable of
leading to correct answers. We note that the proposed SCCM is annotation-free
and compatible with various RFT for MCoT in a plug-and-play manner. Empirical
results demonstrate that SCCM consistently improves the visual faithfulness
across a suite of fine-grained perception and reasoning benchmarks. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合扩散先验与物理渲染的混合重光照框架，用于实现时序稳定的体积视频重光照


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在实现时序稳定、生产就绪的体积视频重光照方面存在困难，扩散方法在单帧表现良好但在序列中不稳定，视频扩散模型受限于内存和规模

Method: 结合扩散衍生的材质先验与时序正则化、物理渲染，通过光流引导的正则化聚合多帧材质属性，并使用高斯不透明度场提取网格代理进行间接效果渲染

Result: 在真实和合成捕获数据上的实验表明，该方法比纯扩散基线在序列重光照稳定性方面显著提升，且能扩展到视频扩散无法处理的更长片段

Conclusion: 混合方法平衡学习先验与物理约束，是实现生产就绪体积视频重光照的实用步骤

Abstract: Volumetric video relighting is essential for bringing captured performances
into virtual worlds, but current approaches struggle to deliver temporally
stable, production-ready results. Diffusion-based intrinsic decomposition
methods show promise for single frames, yet suffer from stochastic noise and
instability when extended to sequences, while video diffusion models remain
constrained by memory and scale. We propose a hybrid relighting framework that
combines diffusion-derived material priors with temporal regularization and
physically motivated rendering. Our method aggregates multiple stochastic
estimates of per-frame material properties into temporally consistent shading
components, using optical-flow-guided regularization. For indirect effects such
as shadows and reflections, we extract a mesh proxy from Gaussian Opacity
Fields and render it within a standard graphics pipeline. Experiments on real
and synthetic captures show that this hybrid strategy achieves substantially
more stable relighting across sequences than diffusion-only baselines, while
scaling beyond the clip lengths feasible for video diffusion. These results
indicate that hybrid approaches, which balance learned priors with physically
grounded constraints, are a practical step toward production-ready volumetric
video relighting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VOLD是一个将文本推理能力从纯文本教师模型转移到视觉语言学生模型的框架，通过强化学习和在线蒸馏相结合，显著提升了视觉语言模型的推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型的复杂推理训练面临高质量图像-文本推理数据稀缺的挑战，而文本推理资源丰富但难以直接用于VLM推理。

Method: 结合GRPO强化学习和在线蒸馏，通过教师模型指导学生推理轨迹，并强调冷启动对齐对有效知识转移的重要性。

Result: 在MMMU-Pro、MathVision、MathVista和LogicVista等多个基准测试中，VOLD显著优于基线模型并超越了现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 通过纯文本教师模型进行在线蒸馏时，基于SFT的冷启动对齐对于有效知识转移至关重要，没有充分的对齐会导致蒸馏指导失效。

Abstract: Training vision-language models (VLMs) for complex reasoning remains a
challenging task, i.a. due to the scarcity of high-quality image-text reasoning
data. Conversely, text-based reasoning resources are abundant and scalable, but
it is still an open question how to leveraging them for VLM reasoning. To
address this problem, we propose VOLD, a framework to transfer reasoning
capabilities from text-only teacher models to VLM student models. To this end,
VOLD combines reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) with on-policy distillation, which allows the student reasoning traces
to be guided by the teacher model, resulting in a significant gain over using
GRPO alone. We further show that a cold-start alignment is essential for an
effective transfer during the online training phase in this scenario and that
without sufficient distributional alignment between teacher and student,
on-policy distillation fails to provide meaningful guidance. We evaluate VOLD
across diverse benchmarks including MMMU-Pro, MathVision, MathVista, and
LogicVista, showing that VOLD outperforms the baseline model significantly and
improves over the state of the art by a margin. Our ablation shows the
importance of a cold-start alignment via SFT for on-policy distillation with a
text-only teacher.

Motivation: 现有图神经网络在图像分类中受限于对视觉实体底层结构和关系的有限考虑，特别是在医学图像分类领域需要更好的结构表示。

Method: iPac整合了补丁分割、特征提取、聚类、图构建和图学习等多个阶段，通过捕捉相关特征并将其组织成簇，构建有意义的图表示来封装图像语义。

Result: 在多个医学图像数据集上的实验表明，iPac相比基线方法平均准确率提升高达5%。

Conclusion: iPac为图像分类，特别是医学图像分类，提供了一个通用解决方案，通过图表示和考虑视觉实体间的固有结构和关系来提升性能。

Abstract: Graph neural networks have emerged as a promising paradigm for image
processing, yet their performance in image classification tasks is hindered by
a limited consideration of the underlying structure and relationships among
visual entities. This work presents iPac, a novel approach to introduce a new
graph representation of images to enhance graph neural network image
classification by recognizing the importance of underlying structure and
relationships in medical image classification. iPac integrates various stages,
including patch partitioning, feature extraction, clustering, graph
construction, and graph-based learning, into a unified network to advance graph
neural network image classification. By capturing relevant features and
organising them into clusters, we construct a meaningful graph representation
that effectively encapsulates the semantics of the image. Experimental
evaluation on diverse medical image datasets demonstrates the efficacy of iPac,
exhibiting an average accuracy improvement of up to 5% over baseline methods.
Our approach offers a versatile and generic solution for image classification,
particularly in the realm of medical images, by leveraging the graph
representation and accounting for the inherent structure and relationships
among visual entities.

TL;DR: FreeFuse是一种无需训练的多主体文本到图像生成方法，通过自动融合多个主体LoRA，利用交叉注意力层权重动态生成主体掩码，实现高质量的多主体生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么专注于推理前的LoRA权重合并，要么依赖分割模型和复杂技术如噪声混合来隔离LoRA输出，这些方法存在效率低和实用性差的问题。

Method: 通过分析交叉注意力层权重自动生成上下文感知的动态主体掩码，在推理过程中将这些掩码直接应用于LoRA输出，无需修改LoRA或使用辅助模型。

Result: FreeFuse在多主体生成任务中，在生成质量和可用性方面均优于现有方法，且无需额外训练、无需修改LoRA、无需辅助模型。

Conclusion: FreeFuse提供了一种实用高效的多主体文本到图像生成解决方案，仅需用户提供LoRA激活词即可无缝集成到标准工作流程中。

Abstract: This paper proposes FreeFuse, a novel training-free approach for
multi-subject text-to-image generation through automatic fusion of multiple
subject LoRAs. In contrast to existing methods that either focus on
pre-inference LoRA weight merging or rely on segmentation models and complex
techniques like noise blending to isolate LoRA outputs, our key insight is that
context-aware dynamic subject masks can be automatically derived from
cross-attention layer weights. Mathematical analysis shows that directly
applying these masks to LoRA outputs during inference well approximates the
case where the subject LoRA is integrated into the diffusion model and used
individually for the masked region. FreeFuse demonstrates superior practicality
and efficiency as it requires no additional training, no modification to LoRAs,
no auxiliary models, and no user-defined prompt templates or region
specifications. Alternatively, it only requires users to provide the LoRA
activation words for seamless integration into standard workflows. Extensive
experiments validate that FreeFuse outperforms existing approaches in both
generation quality and usability under the multi-subject generation tasks. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实世界LiDAR点云标注成本高昂，现有无监督域自适应方法未能有效利用无标签数据，依赖固定置信度阈值导致性能欠佳。

Method: 动态伪标签过滤(DPLF)增强真实数据利用，先验引导数据增强管道(PG-DAP)缓解域偏移，使用数据混合一致性损失学习上下文无关表示。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过动态伪标签过滤和数据增强管道，显著提升了点云语义分割中无标签数据的利用效率。

Abstract: Annotating real-world LiDAR point clouds for use in intelligent autonomous
systems is costly. To overcome this limitation, self-training-based
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has been widely used to improve point
cloud semantic segmentation by leveraging synthetic point cloud data. However,
we argue that existing methods do not effectively utilize unlabeled data, as
they either rely on predefined or fixed confidence thresholds, resulting in
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Pseudo-Label
Filtering (DPLF) scheme to enhance real data utilization in point cloud UDA
semantic segmentation. Additionally, we design a simple and efficient
Prior-Guided Data Augmentation Pipeline (PG-DAP) to mitigate domain shift
between synthetic and real-world point clouds. Finally, we utilize data mixing
consistency loss to push the model to learn context-free representations. We
implement and thoroughly evaluate our approach through extensive comparisons
with state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on two challenging synthetic-to-real
point cloud semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior performance. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the DPLF
and PG-DAP modules. We release the code of our method in this paper.

Motivation: 自我中心视频推理需要推断隐藏意图和识别细粒度交互，但现有MLLMs缺乏具身的第一人称理解能力，限制了其在此类任务中的表现。

Method: 构建了大规模自我中心问答数据集EgoRe-5M，包含1300万个视频片段，标注了详细思维链原理和密集手-物体定位。采用两阶段学习：首先通过监督微调注入推理技能，然后通过强化微调增强时空定位能力。

Result: EgoThinker在多个自我中心基准测试中优于现有方法，在细粒度时空定位任务上取得显著改进。

Conclusion: EgoThinker成功地将自我中心推理能力赋予MLLMs，通过大规模数据集和两阶段学习策略有效解决了自我中心视频理解的核心挑战。

Abstract: Egocentric video reasoning centers on an unobservable agent behind the camera
who dynamically shapes the environment, requiring inference of hidden
intentions and recognition of fine-grained interactions. This core challenge
limits current multimodal large language models MLLMs, which excel at visible
event reasoning but lack embodied, first-person understanding. To bridge this
gap, we introduce EgoThinker, a novel framework that endows MLLMs with robust
egocentric reasoning capabilities through spatio-temporal chain-of-thought
supervision and a two-stage learning curriculum. First, we introduce EgoRe-5M,
a large-scale egocentric QA dataset constructed from 13M diverse egocentric
video clips. This dataset features multi-minute segments annotated with
detailed CoT rationales and dense hand-object grounding. Second, we employ SFT
on EgoRe-5M to instill reasoning skills, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning
RFT to further enhance spatio-temporal localization. Experimental results show
that EgoThinker outperforms existing methods across multiple egocentric
benchmarks, while achieving substantial improvements in fine-grained
spatio-temporal localization tasks. Full code and data are released at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式深度估计方法在训练时会导致预训练模型的图像生成能力严重退化，需要解决这一矛盾。

Method: 提出即插即用框架，通过简单可插拔的转换器在图像生成和深度估计模式间切换，并引入组重用机制提高参数利用率。

Result: MERGE在多个深度估计基准测试中达到最先进性能，同时保持了原始图像生成能力。

Conclusion: 预训练文本到图像模型不仅能生成图像，还能轻松扩展到深度估计任务，MERGE成功释放了这种潜力。

Abstract: Generative depth estimation methods leverage the rich visual priors stored in
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating astonishing zero-shot
capability. However, parameter updates during training lead to catastrophic
degradation in the image generation capability of the pre-trained model. We
introduce MERGE, a unified model for image generation and depth estimation,
starting from a fixed pre-trained text-to-image model. MERGE demonstrates that
the pre-trained text-to-image model can do more than image generation, but also
expand to depth estimation effortlessly. Specifically, MERGE introduces a
play-and-plug framework that enables seamless switching between image
generation and depth estimation modes through simple and pluggable converters.
Meanwhile, we propose a Group Reuse Mechanism to encourage parameter reuse and
improve the utilization of the additional learnable parameters. MERGE unleashes
the powerful depth estimation capability of the pre-trained text-to-image model
while preserving its original image generation ability. Compared to other
unified models for image generation and depth estimation, MERGE achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple depth estimation benchmarks. The

TL;DR: 提出Lookahead Anchoring方法，利用未来时间步的关键帧作为方向性锚点，解决音频驱动人体动画中身份漂移问题，无需额外关键帧生成阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频驱动的人体动画模型在时间自回归生成过程中容易出现身份漂移问题，现有使用关键帧作为时间锚点的方法需要额外生成阶段且限制自然运动动态。

Method: 使用未来时间步的关键帧作为前瞻锚点，模型在响应即时音频线索的同时持续追求这些未来锚点，实现自关键帧化，参考图像直接作为前瞻目标。

Result: 在三个人体动画模型上应用该方法，实现了更好的唇部同步、身份保持和视觉质量，时间前瞻距离自然控制表现力与一致性的平衡。

Conclusion: Lookahead Anchoring通过前瞻锚点机制有效改善了时间条件化，在不同架构上均表现出优越性能，无需额外关键帧生成。

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation models often suffer from identity drift during
temporal autoregressive generation, where characters gradually lose their
identity over time. One solution is to generate keyframes as intermediate
temporal anchors that prevent degradation, but this requires an additional
keyframe generation stage and can restrict natural motion dynamics. To address
this, we propose Lookahead Anchoring, which leverages keyframes from future
timesteps ahead of the current generation window, rather than within it. This
transforms keyframes from fixed boundaries into directional beacons: the model
continuously pursues these future anchors while responding to immediate audio
cues, maintaining consistent identity through persistent guidance. This also
enables self-keyframing, where the reference image serves as the lookahead
target, eliminating the need for keyframe generation entirely. We find that the
temporal lookahead distance naturally controls the balance between expressivity
and consistency: larger distances allow for greater motion freedom, while
smaller ones strengthen identity adherence. When applied to three recent human
animation models, Lookahead Anchoring achieves superior lip synchronization,
identity preservation, and visual quality, demonstrating improved temporal
conditioning across several different architectures. Video results are

Conclusion: FARMER成功统一了归一化流和自回归模型，解决了像素级建模的冗余和复杂度问题，实现了高效的图像生成和精确似然估计。

Abstract: Directly modeling the explicit likelihood of the raw data distribution is key
topic in the machine learning area, which achieves the scaling successes in
Large Language Models by autoregressive modeling. However, continuous AR
modeling over visual pixel data suffer from extremely long sequences and
high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we present FARMER, a novel end-to-end
generative framework that unifies Normalizing Flows (NF) and Autoregressive
(AR) models for tractable likelihood estimation and high-quality image
synthesis directly from raw pixels. FARMER employs an invertible autoregressive
flow to transform images into latent sequences, whose distribution is modeled
implicitly by an autoregressive model. To address the redundancy and complexity
in pixel-level modeling, we propose a self-supervised dimension reduction
scheme that partitions NF latent channels into informative and redundant
groups, enabling more effective and efficient AR modeling. Furthermore, we
design a one-step distillation scheme to significantly accelerate inference
speed and introduce a resampling-based classifier-free guidance algorithm to
boost image generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FARMER
achieves competitive performance compared to existing pixel-based generative
models while providing exact likelihoods and scalable training.

Motivation: 现有3D算法假设相机内参在视频中保持不变，但真实世界视频中内参经常变化，且缺乏动态内参的基准数据集。

Method: 构建包含386个高分辨率室内外视频的数据集，扩展Kalibr工具箱提高标定精度，建立全面的标定实验查找表。

Result: 现有基线方法在动态内参视频上难以实现准确预测，InFlux数据集捕获了更广泛的内参变化和场景多样性。

Conclusion: InFlux填补了动态相机内参基准的空白，为开发更鲁棒的3D理解算法提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Accurately tracking camera intrinsics is crucial for achieving 3D
understanding from 2D video. However, most 3D algorithms assume that camera
intrinsics stay constant throughout a video, which is often not true for many
real-world in-the-wild videos. A major obstacle in this field is a lack of
dynamic camera intrinsics benchmarks--existing benchmarks typically offer
limited diversity in scene content and intrinsics variation, and none provide
per-frame intrinsic changes for consecutive video frames. In this paper, we
present Intrinsics in Flux (InFlux), a real-world benchmark that provides
per-frame ground truth intrinsics annotations for videos with dynamic
intrinsics. Compared to prior benchmarks, InFlux captures a wider range of
intrinsic variations and scene diversity, featuring 143K+ annotated frames from
386 high-resolution indoor and outdoor videos with dynamic camera intrinsics.
To ensure accurate per-frame intrinsics, we build a comprehensive lookup table
of calibration experiments and extend the Kalibr toolbox to improve its
accuracy and robustness. Using our benchmark, we evaluate existing baseline
methods for predicting camera intrinsics and find that most struggle to achieve
accurate predictions on videos with dynamic intrinsics. For the dataset, code,

TL;DR: PRISM-Bench是一个基于谜题的视觉挑战基准，通过要求模型识别思维链中的第一个错误步骤，来评估多模态大语言模型的推理一致性和错误检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法仅关注最终答案准确性，无法评估模型推理过程的逻辑一致性。需要一种诊断性评估来区分流畅生成和忠实推理。

Method: 设计包含符号、几何和类比推理的多步骤视觉谜题，要求模型在给定包含一个错误的思维链中识别第一个错误步骤。

Result: 评估显示最先进的MLLM在流畅生成和忠实推理之间存在持续差距，模型能产生看似合理的思维链但无法定位简单逻辑错误。

Conclusion: PRISM-Bench通过分离答案生成和推理验证，为多模态推理能力提供了更精确的评估视角，强调在开发可信MLLM时需要诊断性评估协议。

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{PRISM-Bench}, a benchmark of puzzle-based visual
challenges designed to evaluate not only whether models can solve problems, but
how their reasoning unfolds. Unlike prior evaluations that measure only
final-answer accuracy, PRISM-Bench introduces a diagnostic task: given a visual
puzzle and a step-by-step chain-of-thought (CoT) containing exactly one error,
models must identify the first incorrect step. This setting enables
fine-grained assessment of logical consistency, error detection, and visual
reasoning. The puzzles in PRISM-Bench require multi-step symbolic, geometric,
and analogical reasoning, resisting shortcuts based on superficial pattern
matching. Evaluations across state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal a persistent gap
between fluent generation and faithful reasoning: models that produce plausible
CoTs often fail to locate simple logical faults. By disentangling answer
generation from reasoning verification, PRISM-Bench offers a sharper lens on
multimodal reasoning competence and underscores the need for diagnostic
evaluation protocols in the development of trustworthy MLLMs.

TL;DR: PixelRefer是一个统一的区域级多模态大语言模型框架，支持图像和视频中用户指定区域的细粒度理解。通过尺度自适应对象分词器和对象中心融合模块，实现了高效的对象级推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM主要关注整体场景理解，缺乏对细粒度、对象中心推理的需求，需要开发能够处理用户指定区域的精细理解能力。

Method: 提出尺度自适应对象分词器(SAOT)从自由形式区域生成紧凑且语义丰富的对象表示，并设计了PixelRefer-Lite变体，通过对象中心融合模块将全局上下文预融合到对象令牌中，形成轻量级对象专用框架。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，PixelRefer以较少的训练样本实现了领先性能，PixelRefer-Lite在保持高语义保真度的同时显著降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: PixelRefer框架成功解决了MLLM在细粒度对象理解方面的不足，通过创新的对象表示和高效架构设计，在性能和效率之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
general-purpose capabilities in open-world visual comprehension. However, most
existing MLLMs primarily focus on holistic, scene-level understanding, often
overlooking the need for fine-grained, object-centric reasoning. In this paper,
we present PixelRefer, a unified region-level MLLM framework that enables
advanced fine-grained understanding over user-specified regions across both
images and videos. Motivated by the observation that LLM attention
predominantly focuses on object-level tokens, we propose a Scale-Adaptive
Object Tokenizer (SAOT) to generate compact and semantically rich object
representations from free-form regions. Our analysis reveals that global visual
tokens contribute mainly in early LLM layers, inspiring the design of
PixelRefer-Lite, an efficient variant that employs an Object-Centric Infusion
module to pre-fuse global context into object tokens. This yields a lightweight
Object-Only Framework that substantially reduces computational cost while
maintaining high semantic fidelity. To facilitate fine-grained instruction
tuning, we curate PixelRefer-2.2M, a high-quality object-centric instruction
dataset. Extensive experiments across a range of benchmarks validate that
PixelRefer achieves leading performance with fewer training samples, while
PixelRefer-Lite offers competitive accuracy with notable gains in efficiency.

TL;DR: TIRE方法通过跟踪、修复和重投影技术，显著提升了3D/4D生成中的语义身份保持能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D/4D生成方法在保持跨视角语义身份一致性方面存在不足，个性化3D/4D生成研究仍不充分

Method: 采用现有3D生成模型的初始资产，通过视频跟踪识别需修改区域，使用主题驱动的2D修复模型逐步填充，最后将修改后的多视角观测重投影回3D

Result: 大量实验表明，相比最先进方法，该方法在3D/4D生成中的身份保持能力显著提升

Conclusion: TIRE方法为个性化3D/4D生成提供了有效的解决方案，能够更好地保持主题的语义身份

Abstract: Current 3D/4D generation methods are usually optimized for photorealism,
efficiency, and aesthetics. However, they often fail to preserve the semantic
identity of the subject across different viewpoints. Adapting generation
methods with one or few images of a specific subject (also known as
Personalization or Subject-driven generation) allows generating visual content
that align with the identity of the subject. However, personalized 3D/4D
generation is still largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce TIRE
(Track, Inpaint, REsplat), a novel method for subject-driven 3D/4D generation.
It takes an initial 3D asset produced by an existing 3D generative model as
input and uses video tracking to identify the regions that need to be modified.
Then, we adopt a subject-driven 2D inpainting model for progressively infilling
the identified regions. Finally, we resplat the modified 2D multi-view
observations back to 3D while still maintaining consistency. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves identity
preservation in 3D/4D generation compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our

TL;DR: Concerto是一个受人类多感官概念学习启发的空间认知模型，通过3D模态内自蒸馏和2D-3D跨模态联合嵌入，学习更一致和信息丰富的空间特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类通过多感官协同学习抽象概念并能从单一模态回忆的启发，开发一个模拟人类概念学习的空间认知模型。

Method: 结合3D模态内自蒸馏与2D-3D跨模态联合嵌入的简约方法，无需复杂架构即可学习空间特征。

Result: 在零样本可视化中展示更一致的空间特征；在线性探测中分别超越最先进的2D和3D自监督模型14.2%和4.8%；在ScanNet上达到80.7% mIoU的新SOTA；还开发了视频点云空间理解和CLIP语言空间投影的变体。

Conclusion: Concerto通过学习产生具有优越细粒度几何和语义一致性的空间表示，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Humans learn abstract concepts through multisensory synergy, and once formed,
such representations can often be recalled from a single modality. Inspired by
this principle, we introduce Concerto, a minimalist simulation of human concept
learning for spatial cognition, combining 3D intra-modal self-distillation with
2D-3D cross-modal joint embedding. Despite its simplicity, Concerto learns more
coherent and informative spatial features, as demonstrated by zero-shot
visualizations. It outperforms both standalone SOTA 2D and 3D self-supervised
models by 14.2% and 4.8%, respectively, as well as their feature concatenation,
in linear probing for 3D scene perception. With full fine-tuning, Concerto sets
new SOTA results across multiple scene understanding benchmarks (e.g., 80.7%
mIoU on ScanNet). We further present a variant of Concerto tailored for
video-lifted point cloud spatial understanding, and a translator that linearly
projects Concerto representations into CLIP's language space, enabling
open-world perception. These results highlight that Concerto emerges spatial
representations with superior fine-grained geometric and semantic consistency.
