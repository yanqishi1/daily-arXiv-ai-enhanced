In most previous works, LoRA weight\nmatrices are randomly initialized with a fixed rank across all attachment\npoints. In this paper, we improve convergence and final performance of LoRA\nfine-tuning, using our proposed data-driven weight initialization method,\nConsNoTrainLoRA (CNTLoRA). We express LoRA initialization as a domain shift\nproblem where we use multiple constraints relating the pre-training and\nfine-tuning activations. By reformulating these constraints, we obtain a\nclosed-form estimate of LoRA weights that depends on pre-training weights and\nfine-tuning activation vectors and hence requires no training during\ninitialization. This weight estimate is decomposed to initialize the up and\ndown matrices with proposed flexibility of variable ranks.

However, optimization-based 3DGS methods struggle\nwith sparse views due to limited prior knowledge. Meanwhile, feed-forward\nGaussian approaches are constrained by input formats, making it challenging to\nincorporate more input views. To address these challenges, we propose RegGS, a\n3D Gaussian registration-based framework for reconstructing unposed sparse\nviews. RegGS aligns local 3D Gaussians generated by a feed-forward network into\na globally consistent 3D Gaussian representation. Technically, we implement an\nentropy-regularized Sinkhorn algorithm to efficiently solve the optimal\ntransport Mixture 2-Wasserstein $(\\text{MW}_2)$ distance, which serves as an\nalignment metric for Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) in $\\mathrm{Sim}(3)$ space.\nFurthermore, we design a joint 3DGS registration module that integrates the\n$\\text{MW}_2$ distance, photometric consistency, and depth geometry. This\nenables a coarse-to-fine registration process while accurately estimating\ncamera poses and aligning the scene. Experiments on the RE10K and ACID datasets\ndemonstrate that RegGS effectively registers local Gaussians with high\nfidelity, achieving precise pose estimation and high-quality novel-view\nsynthesis.

In Natural Language Processing (NLP), numerous\nstudies have demonstrated the effectiveness of ICL.

This paper conducts a comprehensive external and\ninternal investigation of multimodal in-context learning on the image\ncaptioning task. Externally, we explore demonstration configuration strategies\nthrough three dimensions: shot number, image retrieval, and caption assignment.\nWe employ multiple metrics to systematically and thoroughly evaluate and\nsummarize key findings. Internally, we analyze typical LMM attention\ncharacteristics and develop attention-based metrics to quantify model\nbehaviors. We also conduct auxiliary experiments to explore the feasibility of\nattention-driven model acceleration and compression. We further compare\nperformance variations between LMMs with identical model design and pretraining\nstrategies and explain the differences from the angles of pre-training data\nfeatures. Our study reveals both how ICEs configuration strategies impact model\nperformance through external experiments and characteristic typical patterns\nthrough internal inspection, providing dual perspectives for understanding\nmultimodal ICL in LMMs. Our method of combining external and internal analysis\nto investigate large models, along with our newly proposed metrics, can be\napplied to broader research areas.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5168\u9762\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ICL\uff09\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u90e8\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u6f14\u793a\u914d\u7f6e\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u6210\u529f\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5177\u6709ICL\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff08LMM\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u591a\u6a21\u6001ICL\u7684\u6f14\u793a\u914d\u7f6e\u7814\u7a76\u5c1a\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u90e8\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08\u6f14\u793a\u914d\u7f6e\u7b56\u7565\uff1ashot\u6570\u91cf\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u6807\u9898\u5206\u914d\uff09\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9a71\u52a8\u52a0\u901f\u4e0e\u538b\u7f29\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86ICEs\u914d\u7f6e\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u5178\u578bLMM\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5916\u90e8\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u5206\u6790\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u591a\u6a21\u6001ICL\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53cc\u91cd\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

However,\nthe improvement in resolution leads to increased discrepancies in scattering\ncharacteristics, posing challenges to the generalization ability of target\ndetection models. While domain adaptation technology is a potential solution,\nthe inevitable discrepancies caused by resolution differences often lead to\nblind feature adaptation and unreliable semantic propagation, ultimately\ndegrading the domain adaptation performance. To address these challenges, this\npaper proposes a novel SAR target detection method (termed CR-Net), that\nincorporates structure priors and evidential learning theory into the detection\nmodel, enabling reliable domain adaptation for cross-resolution detection. To\nbe specific, CR-Net integrates Structure-induced Hierarchical Feature\nAdaptation (SHFA) and Reliable Structural Adjacency Alignment (RSAA). SHFA\nmodule is introduced to establish structural correlations between targets and\nachieve structure-aware feature adaptation, thereby enhancing the\ninterpretability of the feature adaptation process. Afterwards, the RSAA module\nis proposed to enhance reliable semantic alignment, by leveraging the secure\nadjacency set to transfer valuable discriminative knowledge from the source\ndomain to the target domain.

While existing 3D methods have advanced motion modeling and content\nsynthesis, they often produce rendering artifacts, such as motion blur,\ntemporal jitter, and local penetration, due to limitations in representing\nstable, fine-grained motion fields. Through systematic analysis, we reformulate\ntalking head generation into a unified framework comprising three steps: video\npreprocessing, motion representation, and rendering reconstruction. This\nframework underpins our proposed M2DAO-Talker, which addresses current\nlimitations via multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating\noptimization.Specifically, we devise a novel 2D portrait preprocessing pipeline\nto extract frame-wise deformation control conditions (motion region\nsegmentation masks, and camera parameters) to facilitate motion representation.\nTo ameliorate motion modeling, we elaborate a multi-granular motion decoupling\nstrategy, which independently models non-rigid (oral and facial) and rigid\n(head) motions for improved reconstruction accuracy.Meanwhile, a motion\nconsistency constraint is developed to ensure head-torso kinematic consistency,\nthereby mitigating penetration artifacts caused by motion aliasing. In\naddition, an alternating optimization strategy is designed to iteratively\nrefine facial and oral motion parameters, enabling more realistic video\ngeneration.Experiments across multiple datasets show that M2DAO-Talker achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, with the 2.43 dB PSNR improvement in generation\nquality and 0.64 gain in user-evaluated video realness versus TalkingGaussian\nwhile with 150 FPS inference speed.

To\naddress this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers\nwith highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a\nfixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer\npairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention\ndynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern\nsimilarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable\naccuracy degradation.\n  We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and\nefficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies\nbased on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a\nrecomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key\ninnovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical\ncontext for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the\nconversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to\nmitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model\ngeneration; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles\nbrought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV\ncaches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul\nachieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x\nreduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without\ncompromising generation quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "Krul\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u8f6eLLM\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u538b\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6062\u590d\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86KV\u7f13\u5b58\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2dKV\u7f13\u5b58\u6062\u590d\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u56fa\u5b9a\u538b\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u538b\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u9884\u9009\u7b56\u7565\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u3001\u5f02\u6784\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u548c\u65e0\u6c14\u6ce1\u6062\u590d\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u3002", "result": "TTFT\u51cf\u5c111.5x-2.68x\uff0cKV\u7f13\u5b58\u5b58\u50a8\u51cf\u5c111.33x-2.35x\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "Krul\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

To address\nthis, we propose a new task: Cross-Cancer Single Domain Generalization for\nMultimodal Prognosis, which evaluates whether models trained on a single cancer\ntype can generalize to unseen cancers.

CADE, designed to synthesize the target domain distribution, fuses\nlocal morphological cues and global gene expression in latent space.\nExperiments on a four-cancer-type benchmark demonstrate superior\ngeneralization, laying the foundation for practical, robust cross-cancer\nmultimodal prognosis.

Nevertheless,\nits performance is highly sensitive to the alignment between the query image\nand in-context image-mask pairs. In a clinical scenario, the scarcity of\nannotated medical images makes it challenging to select optimal in-context\npairs, and fine-tuning foundation ICL models on contextual data is infeasible\ndue to computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address\nthis challenge, we propose Cycle Context Verification (CCV), a novel framework\nthat enhances ICL-based medical image segmentation by enabling\nself-verification of predictions and accordingly enhancing contextual\nalignment. Specifically, CCV employs a cyclic pipeline in which the model\ninitially generates a segmentation mask for the query image. Subsequently, the\nroles of the query and an in-context pair are swapped, allowing the model to\nvalidate its prediction by predicting the mask of the original in-context\nimage. The accuracy of this secondary prediction serves as an implicit measure\nof the initial query segmentation. A query-specific prompt is introduced to\nalter the query image and updated to improve the measure, thereby enhancing the\nalignment between the query and in-context pairs. We evaluated CCV on seven\nmedical image segmentation datasets using two ICL foundation models,\ndemonstrating its superiority over existing methods.

Low-light enhancement improves\nimage quality for downstream tasks, but existing methods rely on physical or\ngeometric priors, limiting generalization. Evaluation mainly focuses on visual\nquality rather than downstream performance. Low-light visual understanding,\nconstrained by scarce labeled data, primarily uses task-specific domain\nadaptation, which lacks scalability. To address these challenges, we build a\ngeneralized bridge between low-light enhancement and low-light understanding,\nwhich we term Generalized Enhancement For Understanding (GEFU). This paradigm\nimproves both generalization and scalability. To address the diverse causes of\nlow-light degradation, we leverage pretrained generative diffusion models to\noptimize images, achieving zero-shot generalization performance.

Given the inpainted reference view, we estimate the inpainting\nsimilarity of the other views to adjust their contribution in constructing an\naccurate geometry tailored to the reference.

However, state-of-the-art approaches treat document\nrecognition as a mere computer vision problem, neglecting these underlying\ndocument-type-specific structural properties, making them dependent on\nsub-optimal heuristic post-processing and rendering many less frequent or more\ncomplicated document types inaccessible to modern document recognition. We\nsuggest a novel perspective that frames document recognition as a transcription\ntask from a document to a record. This implies a natural grouping of documents\nbased on the intrinsic structure inherent in their transcription, where related\ndocument types can be treated (and learned) similarly. We propose a method to\ndesign structure-specific inductive biases for the underlying machine-learned\nend-to-end document recognition systems, and a respective base transformer\narchitecture that we successfully adapt to different structures.

These conferences\noften rely on facilitated discussions to ensure productive dialogue and\ncollective agreement. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown\nsignificant promise in simulating real-world scenarios, particularly through\ncollaborative multi-agent systems that mimic group interactions. In this work,\nwe present a novel LLM-based multi-agent system designed to simulate decision\nconferences, specifically focusing on detecting agreement among the participant\nagents. To achieve this, we evaluate six distinct LLMs on two tasks: stance\ndetection, which identifies the position an agent takes on a given issue, and\nstance polarity detection, which identifies the sentiment as positive,\nnegative, or neutral. These models are further assessed within the multi-agent\nsystem to determine their effectiveness in complex simulations. Our results\nindicate that LLMs can reliably detect agreement even in dynamic and nuanced\ndebates. Incorporating an agreement-detection agent within the system can also\nimprove the efficiency of group debates and enhance the overall quality and\ncoherence of deliberations, making them comparable to real-world decision\nconferences regarding outcome and decision-making. These findings demonstrate\nthe potential for LLM-based multi-agent systems to simulate group\ndecision-making processes.

Given the requirement for legally grounded and\nwell-justified analyses, the propensity of LLMs to hallucinate presents a\nconsiderable challenge. The experiments focus on two common methods for\nenhancing LLM performance: fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation\n(RAG). In this study, these methods are applied on both textbook cases and\nreal-world cases from a tax consulting firm to systematically determine the\nbest configurations of LLM-based systems and assess the legal-reasoning\ncapabilities of LLMs. The findings highlight the potential of using LLMs to\nsupport tax consultants by automating routine tasks and providing initial\nanalyses, although current prototypes are not ready for full automation due to\nthe sensitivity of the legal domain. The findings indicate that LLMs, when\nproperly configured, can effectively support tax professionals in VAT tasks and\nprovide legally grounded justifications for decisions.

To address this, we\npropose RadiomicsRetrieval, a 3D content-based retrieval framework bridging\nhandcrafted radiomics descriptors with deep learning-based embeddings at the\ntumor level. Unlike existing 2D approaches, RadiomicsRetrieval fully exploits\nvolumetric data to leverage richer spatial context in medical images. We employ\na promptable segmentation model (e.g., SAM) to derive tumor-specific image\nembeddings, which are aligned with radiomics features extracted from the same\ntumor via contrastive learning. These representations are further enriched by\nanatomical positional embedding (APE). As a result, RadiomicsRetrieval enables\nflexible querying based on shape, location, or partial feature sets. Extensive\nexperiments on both lung CT and brain MRI public datasets demonstrate that\nradiomics features significantly enhance retrieval specificity, while APE\nprovides global anatomical context essential for location-based searches.\nNotably, our framework requires only minimal user prompts (e.g., a single\npoint), minimizing segmentation overhead and supporting diverse clinical\nscenarios.

Existing continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) methods\nare typically built around sudden and severe distribution shifts and neglect\ntemporal continuity, leading to three core defects: limited memory cache\nrestricts long-range distribution modeling, causing catastrophic forgetting;\nentropy-based confidence becomes unreliable under temporal drift, worsening\nerror accumulation; and static visual representations misalign with evolving\ninputs. We formalize this practical problem as \\textit{Continual-Temporal\nTest-Time Adaptation (CT-TTA)}, where test distributions evolve gradually over\ntime. To address it, we propose \\textit{BayesTTA}, a Bayesian adaptation\nframework that enforces temporally consistent predictions and dynamically\naligns visual representations. Specifically, BayesTTA incrementally estimates\nclass-conditional Gaussian mixture distributions without storing raw data,\nadaptively selects covariance structures through statistical hypothesis\ntesting, and performs calibrated inference using Gaussian discriminant analysis\n(GDA). These calibrated predictions supervise self-paced adaptation of\nnormalization layers, ensuring efficient and stable representation alignment.\nWe establish a comprehensive CT-TTA benchmark across four temporally evolving\ndatasets and further evaluate generalization on ten standard TTA datasets.\nExtensive experiments show that BayesTTA consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods, achieving significant gains while maintaining\nefficiency.

In this\npaper, we introduce a novel temporal 3D perception method called OnlineBEV,\nwhich combines BEV features over time using a recurrent structure. This\nstructure increases the effective number of combined features with minimal\nmemory usage. However, it is critical to spatially align the features over time\nto maintain strong performance. OnlineBEV employs the Motion-guided BEV Fusion\nNetwork (MBFNet) to achieve temporal feature alignment. MBFNet extracts motion\nfeatures from consecutive BEV frames and dynamically aligns historical BEV\nfeatures with current ones using these motion features.

This task is especially useful when the audio is unavailable (e.g.\ndeleted) or unreliable (e.g. anonymized speech). Prior work in this area has\nprimarily focused on the feasibility of attributing speakers using transcripts\nproduced by human annotators. However, in real-world settings, one often only\nhas more errorful transcripts produced by automatic speech recognition (ASR)\nsystems. In this paper, we conduct what is, to our knowledge, the first\ncomprehensive study of the impact of automatic transcription on speaker\nattribution performance. In particular, we study the extent to which speaker\nattribution performance degrades in the face of transcription errors, as well\nas how properties of the ASR system impact attribution. We find that\nattribution is surprisingly resilient to word-level transcription errors and\nthat the objective of recovering the true transcript is minimally correlated\nwith attribution performance.

Methods:\nOur model was validated on 35 1.5T and 108 3T T1w MRI paired with corresponding\n7T T1 maps of patients with confirmed MS. A total of 141 patient cases (32,128\nslices) were randomly divided into 105 (25; 80) training cases (19,204 slices),\n19 (5; 14) validation cases (3,476 slices), and 17 (5; 14) test cases (3,145\nslices) where (X; Y) denotes the patients with 1.5T and 3T T1W scans,\nrespectively. The synthetic 7T T1 maps were compared against the ResViT and\nResShift models. Results: The 7T-Restormer model achieved a PSNR of 26.0 +/-\n4.6 dB, SSIM of 0.861 +/- 0.072, and NMSE of 0.019 +/- 0.011 for 1.5T inputs,\nand 25.9 +/- 4.9 dB, and 0.866 +/- 0.077 for 3T inputs, respectively. Using\n10.5 M parameters, our model reduced NMSE by 64 % relative to 56.7M parameter\nResShift (0.019 vs 0.052, p = <.001 and by 41 % relative to 70.4M parameter\nResViT (0.019 vs 0.032, p = <.001) at 1.5T, with similar advantages at 3T\n(0.021 vs 0.060 and 0.033; p < .001).

To mitigate this we propose the\nuse of ensembles of weak learners based on spectral total-variation (STV)\nfeatures (Gilboa 2014). The features are related to nonlinear eigenfunctions of\nthe total-variation subgradient and can characterize well textures at various\nscales. It was shown (Burger et-al 2016) that, in the one-dimensional case,\northogonal features are generated, whereas in two-dimensions the features are\nempirically lowly correlated. Ensemble learning theory advocates the use of\nlowly correlated weak learners. We thus propose here to design ensembles using\nlearners based on STV features. To show the effectiveness of this paradigm we\nexamine a hard real-world medical imaging problem: the predictive value of\ncomputed tomography (CT) data for high uptake in positron emission tomography\n(PET) for patients suspected of skeletal metastases.

Existing autoregressive video generators either diverge from\nstandard LLM architectures, depend on bulky external text encoders, or incur\nprohibitive latency due to next-token decoding. In this paper, we introduce\nLumos-1, an autoregressive video generator that retains the LLM architecture\nwith minimal architectural modifications. To inject spatiotemporal correlations\nin LLMs, we identify the efficacy of incorporating 3D RoPE and diagnose its\nimbalanced frequency spectrum ranges. Therefore, we propose MM-RoPE, a RoPE\nscheme that preserves the original textual RoPE while providing comprehensive\nfrequency spectra and scaled 3D positions for modeling multimodal\nspatiotemporal data. Moreover, Lumos-1 resorts to a token dependency strategy\nthat obeys intra-frame bidirectionality and inter-frame temporal causality.\nBased on this dependency strategy, we identify the issue of frame-wise loss\nimbalance caused by spatial information redundancy and solve it by proposing\nAutoregressive Discrete Diffusion Forcing (AR-DF). AR-DF introduces temporal\ntube masking during training with a compatible inference-time masking policy to\navoid quality degradation. By using memory-efficient training techniques, we\npre-train Lumos-1 on only 48 GPUs, achieving performance comparable to EMU3 on\nGenEval, COSMOS-Video2World on VBench-I2V, and OpenSoraPlan on VBench-T2V.
