*Hyunji Lee,Wenhao Yu,Hongming Zhang,Kaixin Ma,Jiyeon Kim,Dong Yu,Minjoon Seo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 分析了混合状态空间模型与注意力机制架构的设计选择，发现序列混合在短上下文表现更好，并行混合在长上下文更有效，并提出通过数据增强训练进一步提升召回能力的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合模型结合了状态空间模型的效率和注意力的高召回能力，但其架构设计选择尚未得到充分理解，需要分析不同集成方式对性能的影响。

Method: 分析了序列和并行集成SSM与注意力层的方法，并引入基于数据增强的持续训练策略，使用包含释义的数据集来提升模型召回能力。

Result: 序列混合在短上下文表现更好，并行混合在长上下文更有效；数据增强训练方法能有效提升召回能力，且优于架构修改方法，在不同基础模型上都有良好泛化性。

Conclusion: 研究为混合SSM-注意力模型提供了深入理解，并为针对不同用例设计架构提供了实用指导，数据增强方法比架构修改更有效地提升召回能力。

Abstract: Hybrid models that combine state space models (SSMs) with attention
mechanisms have shown strong performance by leveraging the efficiency of SSMs
and the high recall ability of attention. However, the architectural design
choices behind these hybrid models remain insufficiently understood. In this
work, we analyze hybrid architectures through the lens of memory utilization
and overall performance, and propose a complementary method to further enhance
their effectiveness. We first examine the distinction between sequential and
parallel integration of SSM and attention layers. Our analysis reveals several
interesting findings, including that sequential hybrids perform better on
shorter contexts, whereas parallel hybrids are more effective for longer
contexts. We also introduce a data-centric approach of continually training on
datasets augmented with paraphrases, which further enhances recall while
preserving other capabilities. It generalizes well across different base models
and outperforms architectural modifications aimed at enhancing recall. Our
findings provide a deeper understanding of hybrid SSM-attention models and
offer practical guidance for designing architectures tailored to various use
cases. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of hybrid SSM-attention
models and offer practical guidance for designing architectures tailored to
various use cases.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语义框架的医疗事件识别方法，用于从电子病历中检测基于性别的暴力事件，在2100万句巴西葡萄牙语语料上验证，精确度达0.726。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于性别的暴力事件在电子病历中漏报的问题，提高公共卫生监测能力。

Method: 使用语义框架定义细粒度模式，在非结构化电子病历文本中搜索这些模式。

Result: 定义了8个模式，在2100万句语料中识别暴力报告，经语言学家手动评估，平均精确度为0.726。

Conclusion: 该方法透明、高效、低碳且语言无关，可轻松适应其他健康监测场景，促进NLP在公共卫生系统中的伦理和可解释使用。

Abstract: We introduce a methodology for the identification of notifiable events in the
domain of healthcare. The methodology harnesses semantic frames to define
fine-grained patterns and search them in unstructured data, namely, open-text
fields in e-medical records. We apply the methodology to the problem of
underreporting of gender-based violence (GBV) in e-medical records produced
during patients' visits to primary care units. A total of eight patterns are
defined and searched on a corpus of 21 million sentences in Brazilian
Portuguese extracted from e-SUS APS. The results are manually evaluated by
linguists and the precision of each pattern measured. Our findings reveal that
the methodology effectively identifies reports of violence with a precision of
0.726, confirming its robustness. Designed as a transparent, efficient,
low-carbon, and language-agnostic pipeline, the approach can be easily adapted
to other health surveillance contexts, contributing to the broader, ethical,
and explainable use of NLP in public health systems.

TL;DR: MEDIQA-OE 2025是首个从医患对话中提取医疗指令的共享任务，旨在减轻临床医生的文档负担并改善患者护理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然临床文档越来越多地使用自动语音识别和摘要技术，但将对话转化为电子健康记录中的可操作医疗指令仍未被探索。解决这个问题可以显著减轻临床医生的文档负担并直接影响下游患者护理。

Method: 引入了MEDIQA-OE 2025共享任务，六个团队参与并尝试了广泛的方法，包括闭源和开源的大语言模型。

Electronic Health Records remains unexplored. A solution to this problem can
significantly reduce the documentation burden of clinicians and directly impact
downstream patient care. We introduce the MEDIQA-OE 2025 shared task, the first
challenge on extracting medical orders from doctor-patient conversations. Six
teams participated in the shared task and experimented with a broad range of
approaches, and both closed- and open-weight large language models (LLMs). In
this paper, we describe the MEDIQA-OE task, dataset, final leaderboard ranking,
and participants' solutions.

### [4] [Semantically-Aware LLM Agent to Enhance Privacy in Conversational AI Services](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27016)
*Jayden Serenari,Stephen Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了LOPSIDED框架，通过语义感知的伪名化技术保护用户与LLM对话中的敏感PII数据，在保持对话上下文完整性的同时提升隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对话AI系统的普及，用户在与大语言模型交互时可能泄露包含个人身份信息(PII)的敏感数据，存在隐私泄露和身份盗窃风险。

Method: LOPSIDED框架动态地将用户提示中的敏感PII实体替换为语义一致的伪名，在模型生成响应后自动进行反伪名化处理。

Result: 在ShareGPT真实对话数据上的评估显示，相比基线技术，LOPSIDED将语义效用错误减少了5倍，同时增强了隐私保护。

Conclusion: LOPSIDED框架能够有效保护用户隐私，在维持对话质量的同时显著减少语义错误，为远程LLM使用提供了实用的隐私保护解决方案。

Abstract: With the increasing use of conversational AI systems, there is growing
concern over privacy leaks, especially when users share sensitive personal data
in interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs). Conversations shared with
these models may contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII), which, if
exposed, could lead to security breaches or identity theft. To address this
challenge, we present the Local Optimizations for Pseudonymization with
Semantic Integrity Directed Entity Detection (LOPSIDED) framework, a
semantically-aware privacy agent designed to safeguard sensitive PII data when
using remote LLMs. Unlike prior work that often degrade response quality, our
approach dynamically replaces sensitive PII entities in user prompts with
semantically consistent pseudonyms, preserving the contextual integrity of
conversations. Once the model generates its response, the pseudonyms are
automatically depseudonymized, ensuring the user receives an accurate,
privacy-preserving output. We evaluate our approach using real-world
conversations sourced from ShareGPT, which we further augment and annotate to
assess whether named entities are contextually relevant to the model's
response. Our results show that LOPSIDED reduces semantic utility errors by a
factor of 5 compared to baseline techniques, all while enhancing privacy.

### [5] [Kad: A Framework for Proxy-based Test-time Alignment with Knapsack Approximation Deferral](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27017)
*Ayoub Hammal,Pierre Zweigenbaum,Caio Corro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于代理的测试时对齐方法，使用小型对齐模型指导大语言模型，通过令牌级级联和0-1背包问题优化延迟决策，在任务性能和推测解码速度方面都有提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然预训练阶段已获得大部分生成能力，但仍需对齐以满足下游任务需求，而随着模型规模扩大，对齐过程的计算成本急剧增加。

Method: 采用令牌级级联方法，将令牌特定延迟规则简化为0-1背包问题，推导出最优延迟决策的原始和对偶近似解。

Result: 实验证明该方法在任务性能和推测解码速度方面都带来了显著优势。

Conclusion: 提出的代理测试时对齐方法有效降低了大规模语言模型对齐的计算成本，同时保持了性能表现。

Abstract: Several previous works concluded that the largest part of generation
capabilities of large language models (LLM) are learned (early) during
pre-training. However, LLMs still require further alignment to adhere to
downstream task requirements and stylistic preferences, among other desired
properties. As LLMs continue to scale in terms of size, the computational cost
of alignment procedures increase prohibitively. In this work, we propose a
novel approach to circumvent these costs via proxy-based test-time alignment,
i.e. using guidance from a small aligned model. Our approach can be described
as token-specific cascading method, where the token-specific deferral rule is
reduced to 0-1 knapsack problem. In this setting, we derive primal and dual
approximations of the optimal deferral decision. We experimentally show the
benefits of our method both in task performance and speculative decoding speed.

*Shang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ELM是一种针对紧凑语言模型的神经架构搜索方法，通过灵活的搜索空间和动态模块调整，结合新颖的知识蒸馏损失，显著提升了模型效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型预训练语言模型的计算和内存需求带来了经济和环境问题，需要开发更紧凑高效的模型。

Method: 扩展现有NAS方法，引入包含高效transformer块和动态维度/头数调整模块的灵活搜索空间，以及保留各块特性的知识蒸馏损失。

Result: 在掩码语言建模和因果语言建模任务上，ELM发现的模型显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ELM通过改进的架构搜索和知识蒸馏技术，成功开发出更高效紧凑的语言模型。

Abstract: As large pre-trained language models become increasingly critical to natural
language understanding (NLU) tasks, their substantial computational and memory
requirements have raised significant economic and environmental concerns.
Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces the Elastic Language Model
(ELM), a novel neural architecture search (NAS) method optimized for compact
language models. ELM extends existing NAS approaches by introducing a flexible
search space with efficient transformer blocks and dynamic modules for
dimension and head number adjustment. These innovations enhance the efficiency
and flexibility of the search process, which facilitates more thorough and
effective exploration of model architectures. We also introduce novel knowledge
distillation losses that preserve the unique characteristics of each block, in
order to improve the discrimination between architectural choices during the
search process. Experiments on masked language modeling and causal language
modeling tasks demonstrate that models discovered by ELM significantly
outperform existing methods.

### [7] [Dataset Creation and Baseline Models for Sexism Detection in Hausa](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27038)
*Fatima Adam Muhammad,Shamsuddeen Muhammad Hassan,Isa Inuwa-Dutse*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究创建了首个豪萨语性别歧视检测数据集，通过社区参与、定性编码和数据增强开发，并探索了传统机器学习与预训练多语言模型在豪萨语性别歧视检测中的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线平台助长了各种形式的性别歧视，而现有计算检测方法主要针对高资源语言，低资源语言如豪萨语由于语言资源有限和文化差异，性别歧视检测进展缓慢。

Method: 通过两阶段用户研究（n=66）收集本地说话者对性别歧视的定义和表达，结合社区参与、定性编码和数据增强构建数据集，并比较传统机器学习分类器与预训练多语言模型的性能。

Result: 研究发现捕捉文化细微差别存在挑战，特别是在寻求澄清和习语表达方面，这些情况下容易出现许多误报。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了在低资源语言中检测性别歧视时考虑文化背景和语言特点的重要性，为豪萨语性别歧视检测提供了首个基准数据集和方法探索。

Abstract: Sexism reinforces gender inequality and social exclusion by perpetuating
stereotypes, bias, and discriminatory norms. Noting how online platforms enable
various forms of sexism to thrive, there is a growing need for effective sexism
detection and mitigation strategies. While computational approaches to sexism
detection are widespread in high-resource languages, progress remains limited
in low-resource languages where limited linguistic resources and cultural
differences affect how sexism is expressed and perceived. This study introduces
the first Hausa sexism detection dataset, developed through community
engagement, qualitative coding, and data augmentation. For cultural nuances and
linguistic representation, we conducted a two-stage user study (n=66) involving
native speakers to explore how sexism is defined and articulated in everyday
discourse. We further experiment with both traditional machine learning
classifiers and pre-trained multilingual language models and evaluating the
effectiveness few-shot learning in detecting sexism in Hausa. Our findings
highlight challenges in capturing cultural nuance, particularly with
clarification-seeking and idiomatic expressions, and reveal a tendency for many
false positives in such cases.

### [9] [Recursive numeral systems are highly regular and easy to process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27049)
*Ponrawee Prasertsom,Andrea Silvi,Jennifer Culbertson,Moa Johansson,Devdatt Dubhashi,Kenny Smith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Previous work has argued that recursive numeral systems optimise the
trade-off between lexicon size and average morphosyntatic complexity (Deni\'c
and Szymanik, 2024). However, showing that only natural-language-like systems
optimise this tradeoff has proven elusive, and the existing solution has relied
on ad-hoc constraints to rule out unnatural systems (Yang and Regier, 2025).
Here, we argue that this issue arises because the proposed trade-off has
neglected regularity, a crucial aspect of complexity central to human grammars
in general. Drawing on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) approach, we
propose that recursive numeral systems are better viewed as efficient with
regard to their regularity and processing complexity. We show that our
MDL-based measures of regularity and processing complexity better capture the
key differences between attested, natural systems and unattested but possible
ones, including "optimal" recursive numeral systems from previous work, and
that the ad-hoc constraints from previous literature naturally follow from
regularity. Our approach highlights the need to incorporate regularity across
sets of forms in studies that attempt to measure and explain optimality in
language.

### [10] [VISTA Score: Verification In Sequential Turn-based Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27052)
*Ashley Lewis,Andrew Perrault,Eric Fosler-Lussier,Michael White*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VISTA是一个用于评估对话系统事实性的框架，通过声明级验证和序列一致性跟踪来检测多轮对话中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对话AI系统在需要事实可靠性的场景中面临幻觉问题，现有评估指标要么评估孤立回复，要么将不可验证内容视为错误，限制了在多轮对话中的应用。

Method: VISTA将每个助手回复分解为原子事实声明，根据可信来源和对话历史进行验证，并对不可验证声明进行分类（主观、矛盾、缺乏证据或弃权）。

Result: 在8个大型语言模型和4个对话事实性基准测试中，VISTA显著优于FACTSCORE和LLM-as-Judge基线方法，人类评估证实其分解方法提高了标注者一致性并揭示了现有基准的不一致性问题。

Conclusion: 通过将事实性建模为对话的动态属性，VISTA为对话系统提供了更透明、更符合人类认知的真实性衡量标准。

Abstract: Hallucination--defined here as generating statements unsupported or
contradicted by available evidence or conversational context--remains a major
obstacle to deploying conversational AI systems in settings that demand factual
reliability. Existing metrics either evaluate isolated responses or treat
unverifiable content as errors, limiting their use for multi-turn dialogue. We
introduce VISTA (Verification In Sequential Turn-based Assessment), a framework
for evaluating conversational factuality through claim-level verification and
sequential consistency tracking. VISTA decomposes each assistant turn into
atomic factual claims, verifies them against trusted sources and dialogue
history, and categorizes unverifiable statements (subjective, contradicted,
lacking evidence, or abstaining). Across eight large language models and four
dialogue factuality benchmarks (AIS, BEGIN, FAITHDIAL, and FADE), VISTA
substantially improves hallucination detection over FACTSCORE and LLM-as-Judge
baselines. Human evaluation confirms that VISTA's decomposition improves
annotator agreement and reveals inconsistencies in existing benchmarks. By
modeling factuality as a dynamic property of conversation, VISTA offers a more
transparent, human-aligned measure of truthfulness in dialogue systems.

*Xiaofan Guo,Yaxuan Luan,Yue Kang,Xiangchen Song,Jinxu Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合多粒度记忆索引和不确定性估计的置信度控制方法，用于改进复杂知识环境下的检索增强生成，解决了覆盖不足、结果不稳定和可靠性有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂知识环境下检索增强生成存在的覆盖不足、结果不稳定和可靠性有限的问题，提升模型在复杂场景中的稳定性和鲁棒性。

Method: 构建分层记忆结构将知识表示划分为不同粒度级别，实现从局部细节到全局上下文的动态索引和检索；引入不确定性估计机制，在生成过程中显式约束和过滤低置信度路径；优化目标包括生成损失、熵约束和方差正则化。

Result: 在QA准确性、检索召回率、排序质量和事实一致性方面优于现有模型，证明了多粒度索引与置信度控制结合的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅为检索增强生成提供了新的技术路径，还为提升大模型在复杂上下文中的可靠性和可控性提供了实践证据。

Abstract: This paper addresses the issues of insufficient coverage, unstable results,
and limited reliability in retrieval-augmented generation under complex
knowledge environments, and proposes a confidence control method that
integrates multi-granularity memory indexing with uncertainty estimation. The
method builds a hierarchical memory structure that divides knowledge
representations into different levels of granularity, enabling dynamic indexing
and retrieval from local details to global context, and thus establishing
closer semantic connections between retrieval and generation. On this basis, an
uncertainty estimation mechanism is introduced to explicitly constrain and
filter low-confidence paths during the generation process, allowing the model
to maintain information coverage while effectively suppressing noise and false
content. The overall optimization objective consists of generation loss,
entropy constraints, and variance regularization, forming a unified confidence
control framework. In the experiments, comprehensive sensitivity tests and
comparative analyses were designed, covering hyperparameters, environmental
conditions, and data structures, to verify the stability and robustness of the
proposed method across different scenarios. The results show that the method
achieves superior performance over existing models in QA accuracy, retrieval
recall, ranking quality, and factual consistency, demonstrating the
effectiveness of combining multi-granularity indexing with confidence control.
This study not only provides a new technical pathway for retrieval-augmented
generation but also offers practical evidence for improving the reliability and
controllability of large models in complex contexts.

*Michał Zawalski,Meriem Boubdir,Klaudia Bałazy,Besmira Nushi,Pablo Ribalta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoDeC是一种通过上下文学习检测LLM训练数据污染的方法，能区分记忆的训练数据和未见数据，产生可解释的污染分数


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要检测和量化大型语言模型中的训练数据污染问题，特别是对于训练语料未公开的开源模型

Method: 通过测量上下文学习对模型性能的影响来检测污染，发现上下文示例通常会提升未见数据集的置信度，但对训练过的数据集可能因记忆模式被破坏而降低置信度

Result: CoDeC产生可解释的污染分数，能清晰区分已见和未见数据集，并在训练语料未公开的开源模型中揭示了强烈的记忆证据

Conclusion: 该方法简单、自动化，且与模型和数据集无关，易于与基准评估集成

Abstract: We present Contamination Detection via Context (CoDeC), a practical and
accurate method to detect and quantify training data contamination in large
language models. CoDeC distinguishes between data memorized during training and
data outside the training distribution by measuring how in-context learning
affects model performance. We find that in-context examples typically boost
confidence for unseen datasets but may reduce it when the dataset was part of
training, due to disrupted memorization patterns. Experiments show that CoDeC
produces interpretable contamination scores that clearly separate seen and
unseen datasets, and reveals strong evidence of memorization in open-weight
models with undisclosed training corpora. The method is simple, automated, and
both model- and dataset-agnostic, making it easy to integrate with benchmark
evaluations.

Result: 在知识转移、鲁棒性和整体安全性方面显著优于现有基线方法，在多个关键指标上达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: 不仅丰富了参数高效微调的理论体系，还为构建更安全可信的对齐机制提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of large-scale language models in safety
alignment and robustness by proposing a fine-tuning method that combines
contrastive distillation with noise-robust training. The method freezes the
backbone model and transfers the knowledge boundaries of the teacher model to
the student model through distillation, thereby improving semantic consistency
and alignment accuracy. At the same time, noise perturbations and robust
optimization constraints are introduced during training to ensure that the
model maintains stable predictive outputs under noisy and uncertain inputs. The
overall framework consists of distillation loss, robustness loss, and a
regularization term, forming a unified optimization objective that balances
alignment ability with resistance to interference. To systematically validate
its effectiveness, the study designs experiments from multiple perspectives,
including distillation weight sensitivity, stability analysis under computation
budgets and mixed-precision environments, and the impact of data noise and
distribution shifts on model performance. Results show that the method
significantly outperforms existing baselines in knowledge transfer, robustness,
and overall safety, achieving the best performance across several key metrics.
This work not only enriches the theoretical system of parameter-efficient
fine-tuning but also provides a new solution for building safer and more
trustworthy alignment mechanisms.

*Adel Khorramrouz,Sharon Levy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM安全防护措施存在选择性拒绝偏见，对不同人口统计群体的有害内容生成请求表现出不一致的拒绝率，这可能导致新的安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM安全防护措施是否在防止恶意内容生成时，无意中引入或反映了新的偏见，即对不同人口统计群体的拒绝行为不一致。

Method: 通过分析针对个体和交叉人口统计群体的拒绝率、LLM响应类型以及生成拒绝内容的长度，来评估选择性拒绝偏见。

Result: 在性别、性取向、国籍和宗教等属性上发现了选择性拒绝偏见的证据，并通过间接攻击测试了针对先前被拒绝群体的安全影响。

Conclusion: LLM安全防护措施需要在不同人口统计群体间实现更公平和鲁棒的性能，以避免引入新的偏见和安全风险。

Abstract: Safety guardrails in large language models(LLMs) are developed to prevent
malicious users from generating toxic content at a large scale. However, these
measures can inadvertently introduce or reflect new biases, as LLMs may refuse
to generate harmful content targeting some demographic groups and not others.
We explore this selective refusal bias in LLM guardrails through the lens of
refusal rates of targeted individual and intersectional demographic groups,
types of LLM responses, and length of generated refusals. Our results show
evidence of selective refusal bias across gender, sexual orientation,
nationality, and religion attributes. This leads us to investigate additional
safety implications via an indirect attack, where we target previously refused
groups. Our findings emphasize the need for more equitable and robust
performance in safety guardrails across demographic groups.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM评估NLG时存在评分不一致性问题，但通过合理使用仍可发挥作用


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着NLG广泛应用，传统评估指标与人类偏好存在差距，而LLM评估虽然更接近人类偏好，但存在评分不一致性问题

Method: 通过实验量化LLM评估在不同NLG任务和基准中的评分不一致性，并探索合理使用LLM评估的指导原则

Result: LLM评估在不同运行中评分可靠性低，存在显著方差，导致评分不一致甚至随意

Conclusion: 虽然LLM评估存在不一致性问题，但通过制定合理使用指南仍可发挥其评估作用

Abstract: As Natural Language Generation (NLG) continues to be widely adopted, properly
assessing it has become quite difficult. Lately, using large language models
(LLMs) for evaluating these generations has gained traction, as they tend to
align more closely with human preferences than conventional n-gram or
embedding-based metrics. In our experiments, we show that LLM judges have low
intra-rater reliability in their assigned scores across different runs. This
variance makes their ratings inconsistent, almost arbitrary in the worst case,
making it difficult to measure how good their judgments actually are. We
quantify this inconsistency across different NLG tasks and benchmarks and see
if judicious use of LLM judges can still be useful following proper guidelines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文分析了transformer语言模型的表达能力，发现自回归和概率化特性会改变其表达能力，打破了非概率情况下的等价关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要将transformer视为语言识别器（接受或拒绝字符串），但实际应用中它们作为语言模型（自回归概率生成字符串）使用。需要研究transformer在语言模型使用场景下的表达能力。

Method: 通过理论分析，研究transformer语言模型能够表达的概率分布特性，比较自回归和概率化对表达能力的影响。

Result: 发现自回归特性有时能增加transformer的表达能力，而概率化会打破非概率情况下的等价关系。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了transformer在语言模型使用场景下的表达能力特性，为理解其实际应用能力提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Most expressivity results for transformers treat them as language recognizers
(which accept or reject strings), and not as they are used in practice, as
language models (which generate strings autoregressively and
probabilistically). Here, we characterize the probability distributions that
transformer language models can express. We show that making transformer
language recognizers autoregressive can sometimes increase their expressivity,
and that making them probabilistic can break equivalences that hold in the
non-probabilistic case. Our overall contribution is to tease apart what
functions transformers are capable of expressing, in their most common use-case
as language models.

*Mason Shipton,York Hay Ng,Aditya Khan,Phuong Hanh Hoang,Xiang Lu,A. Seza Doğruöz,En-Shiun Annie Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文扩展了URIEL+语言知识库，通过添加脚本向量、整合Glottolog语言数据以及扩展谱系插补，显著减少了数据稀疏性问题，提升了跨语言迁移任务中低资源语言的支持能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: URIEL+语言知识库存在数据稀疏问题，包括缺失特征类型、不完整的语言条目和有限的谱系覆盖，这限制了其在跨语言迁移特别是低资源语言支持方面的实用性。

Method: 引入脚本向量表示7,488种语言的书写系统属性；整合Glottolog添加18,710种额外语言；扩展谱系插补，为26,449种语言在谱系间传播类型学和脚本特征。

Result: 脚本向量特征稀疏度降低14%；语言覆盖增加最多19,015种语言（增长1,007%）；插补质量指标提升最多33%；在跨语言迁移任务中某些设置下性能提升达6%。

Conclusion: 这些扩展使URIEL+更加完整和包容，为多语言研究提供了更全面的支持，特别是在低资源语言方面。

Abstract: The URIEL+ linguistic knowledge base supports multilingual research by
encoding languages through geographic, genetic, and typological vectors.
However, data sparsity remains prevalent, in the form of missing feature types,
incomplete language entries, and limited genealogical coverage. This limits the
usefulness of URIEL+ in cross-lingual transfer, particularly for supporting
low-resource languages. To address this sparsity, this paper extends URIEL+
with three contributions: introducing script vectors to represent writing
system properties for 7,488 languages, integrating Glottolog to add 18,710
additional languages, and expanding lineage imputation for 26,449 languages by
propagating typological and script features across genealogies. These additions
reduce feature sparsity by 14% for script vectors, increase language coverage
by up to 19,015 languages (1,007%), and improve imputation quality metrics by
up to 33%. Our benchmark on cross-lingual transfer tasks (oriented around
low-resource languages) shows occasionally divergent performance compared to
URIEL+, with performance gains up to 6% in certain setups. Our advances make
URIEL+ more complete and inclusive for multilingual research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MemeArena框架，通过基于代理的竞技场式评估来评估多模态大语言模型对有害多模态内容的理解能力，减少评估偏见并提高与人类偏好的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法主要关注二元分类任务的检测准确率，无法反映不同情境下有害性理解的深度解释细微差别。

Method: 构建基于代理的竞技场式评估框架，模拟多样化解释情境，通过整合不同观点和达成评估者共识来实现公平比较。

Result: 实验表明该框架有效减少了评估偏见，判断结果与人类偏好高度一致。

Conclusion: MemeArena为多模态有害性理解提供了可靠且全面的mLLM评估方法。

Abstract: The proliferation of memes on social media necessitates the capabilities of
multimodal Large Language Models (mLLMs) to effectively understand multimodal
harmfulness. Existing evaluation approaches predominantly focus on mLLMs'
detection accuracy for binary classification tasks, which often fail to reflect
the in-depth interpretive nuance of harmfulness across diverse contexts. In
this paper, we propose MemeArena, an agent-based arena-style evaluation
framework that provides a context-aware and unbiased assessment for mLLMs'
understanding of multimodal harmfulness. Specifically, MemeArena simulates
diverse interpretive contexts to formulate evaluation tasks that elicit
perspective-specific analyses from mLLMs. By integrating varied viewpoints and
reaching consensus among evaluators, it enables fair and unbiased comparisons
of mLLMs' abilities to interpret multimodal harmfulness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework effectively reduces the evaluation biases of
judge agents, with judgment results closely aligning with human preferences,
offering valuable insights into reliable and comprehensive mLLM evaluations in
multimodal harmfulness understanding. Our code and data are publicly available

*Yulin Ou,Yu Wang,Yang Xu,Hendrik Buschmeier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为AutoPeriod of Surprisal (APS)的新方法，用于检测自然语言中信息密度的周期性模式，发现在人类语言中存在显著的周期性信息模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究自然语言中编码信息的周期性程度，探索信息密度在语言中的分布规律。

Method: 采用APS方法，使用规范的周期性检测算法来识别单个文档中惊奇值序列的任何显著周期。

Result: 发现相当比例的人类语言表现出强烈的信息周期性模式；找到了超出典型文本结构单元分布的新周期，并通过谐波回归模型进一步确认。

Conclusion: 语言中信息的周期性是结构化因素和长距离作用因素共同作用的结果；该方法在LLM生成检测方面具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Recent theoretical advancement of information density in natural language has
brought the following question on desk: To what degree does natural language
exhibit periodicity pattern in its encoded information? We address this
question by introducing a new method called AutoPeriod of Surprisal (APS). APS
adopts a canonical periodicity detection algorithm and is able to identify any
significant periods that exist in the surprisal sequence of a single document.
By applying the algorithm to a set of corpora, we have obtained the following
interesting results: Firstly, a considerable proportion of human language
demonstrates a strong pattern of periodicity in information; Secondly, new
periods that are outside the distributions of typical structural units in text
(e.g., sentence boundaries, elementary discourse units, etc.) are found and
further confirmed via harmonic regression modeling. We conclude that the
periodicity of information in language is a joint outcome from both structured
factors and other driving factors that take effect at longer distances. The
advantages of our periodicity detection method and its potentials in
LLM-generation detection are further discussed.

*Mohammad Tavakoli,Alireza Salemi,Carrie Ye,Mohamed Abdalla,Hamed Zamani,J Ross Mitchell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了BEAM基准测试和LIGHT框架，用于评估和改进LLM在长对话中的记忆能力。BEAM包含100个对话和2000个问题，LIGHT框架为LLM配备了三种记忆系统，显著提升了模型在长对话中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试缺乏叙事连贯性、覆盖领域狭窄，且仅测试简单的回忆任务，无法有效评估LLM在需要长期记忆和长上下文推理任务中的能力。

Method: 1) 提出自动生成长对话的框架，构建BEAM基准测试；2) 提出LIGHT框架，为LLM配备长期情景记忆、短期工作记忆和事实积累便签三种互补记忆系统。

Result: 实验显示，即使具有100万token上下文窗口的LLM（无论是否使用检索增强）在对话变长时表现都会下降。而LIGHT框架在不同模型上均能持续提升性能，平均比最强基线提升3.5%-12.69%。消融研究证实了每个记忆组件的贡献。

Conclusion: LIGHT框架通过模拟人类认知的多记忆系统，有效提升了LLM在长对话中的记忆能力，为解决LLM在长上下文推理任务中的挑战提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Evaluating the abilities of large language models (LLMs) for tasks that
require long-term memory and thus long-context reasoning, for example in
conversational settings, is hampered by the existing benchmarks, which often
lack narrative coherence, cover narrow domains, and only test simple
recall-oriented tasks. This paper introduces a comprehensive solution to these
challenges. First, we present a novel framework for automatically generating
long (up to 10M tokens), coherent, and topically diverse conversations,
accompanied by probing questions targeting a wide range of memory abilities.
From this, we construct BEAM, a new benchmark comprising 100 conversations and
2,000 validated questions. Second, to enhance model performance, we propose
LIGHT-a framework inspired by human cognition that equips LLMs with three
complementary memory systems: a long-term episodic memory, a short-term working
memory, and a scratchpad for accumulating salient facts. Our experiments on
BEAM reveal that even LLMs with 1M token context windows (with and without
retrieval-augmentation) struggle as dialogues lengthen. In contrast, LIGHT
consistently improves performance across various models, achieving an average
improvement of 3.5%-12.69% over the strongest baselines, depending on the
backbone LLM. An ablation study further confirms the contribution of each
memory component.

### [21] [Languages are Modalities: Cross-Lingual Alignment via Encoder Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27254)
*Rajan Agarwal,Aarush Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLINK是一种计算高效的语言注入方法，通过将多语言编码器的句子嵌入对齐到解码器的潜在空间，无需改变分词器或重新训练解码器，显著提升了低资源非拉丁语系语言在指令调优大语言模型中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指令调优的大语言模型在低资源、非拉丁语系脚本上表现不佳，主要原因是分词器碎片化和弱跨语言耦合。

Method: 首先通过轻量级对比投影器将冻结多语言编码器的句子嵌入对齐到解码器潜在嵌入空间中的保留位置；然后将该向量扩展为K个软槽，通过最小适配器训练，使冻结解码器能够消费该信号。

Result: LLINK显著改善了双语检索性能，在LLM评判的问答评估中，81.3%优于基础模型，63.6%优于直接微调。改进归因于减少分词膨胀和更强的跨语言对齐，尽管在数值保真度方面仍有残余弱点。

Conclusion: 将低资源语言视为一种模态，为轻量级LLMs中实现更强的跨语言对齐提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) underperform on low resource,
non-Latin scripts due to tokenizer fragmentation and weak cross-lingual
coupling. We present LLINK (Latent Language Injection for Non-English
Knowledge), a compute efficient language-as-modality method that conditions an
instruction-tuned decoder without changing the tokenizer or retraining the
decoder. First, we align sentence embeddings from a frozen multilingual encoder
to the decoder's latent embedding space at a reserved position via a
lightweight contrastive projector. Second, the vector is expanded into K soft
slots and trained with minimal adapters so the frozen decoder consumes the
signal. LLINK substantially improves bilingual retrieval and achieves 81.3%
preference over the base model and 63.6% over direct fine-tuning in LLM-judged
Q&A evaluations. We further find that improvements can be attributed to reduced
tokenization inflation and a stronger cross lingual alignment, despite the
model having residual weaknesses in numeric fidelity. Treating low resource
languages as a modality offers a practical path to stronger cross-lingual
alignment in lightweight LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了MedCalc-Eval基准测试，包含700多个医疗计算任务，涵盖方程计算和评分系统，并开发了MedCalc-Env强化学习环境来提升LLM的医疗计算能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗基准测试主要关注问答和描述性推理，忽视了临床决策中至关重要的定量推理能力，现有数据集覆盖的计算任务有限且未能反映真实世界计算场景。

Method: 构建包含700多个任务的MedCalc-Eval基准测试，分为方程计算和规则评分系统两类，涵盖多个医学专科；开发基于InternBootcamp框架的MedCalc-Env强化学习环境，支持多步临床推理和规划。

Result: 在MedCalc-Eval基准上对Qwen2.5-32B模型进行微调，在数值敏感性、公式选择和推理鲁棒性方面取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了医疗计算评估的空白，但单位转换、多条件逻辑和上下文理解仍是待解决的挑战。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) enter the medical domain, most benchmarks
evaluate them on question answering or descriptive reasoning, overlooking
quantitative reasoning critical to clinical decision-making. Existing datasets
like MedCalc-Bench cover few calculation tasks and fail to reflect real-world
computational scenarios.
  We introduce MedCalc-Eval, the largest benchmark for assessing LLMs' medical
calculation abilities, comprising 700+ tasks across two types: equation-based
(e.g., Cockcroft-Gault, BMI, BSA) and rule-based scoring systems (e.g., Apgar,
Glasgow Coma Scale). These tasks span diverse specialties including internal
medicine, surgery, pediatrics, and cardiology, offering a broader and more
challenging evaluation setting.
  To improve performance, we further develop MedCalc-Env, a reinforcement
learning environment built on the InternBootcamp framework, enabling multi-step
clinical reasoning and planning. Fine-tuning a Qwen2.5-32B model within this
environment achieves state-of-the-art results on MedCalc-Eval, with notable
gains in numerical sensitivity, formula selection, and reasoning robustness.
Remaining challenges include unit conversion, multi-condition logic, and
contextual understanding.

*Deokhyung Kang,Seonjeong Hwang,Daehui Kim,Hyounghun Kim,Gary Geunbae Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 推理语言模型存在多语言推理差距，主要原因是语言理解失败。本文提出选择性翻译策略，仅在检测到理解失败时翻译输入，在仅翻译约20%输入的情况下达到接近全翻译的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理语言模型在复杂推理任务上表现良好，但在高资源语言和低资源语言之间存在多语言推理差距。虽然已有研究试图缩小这一差距，但其根本原因仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 通过分析发现多语言推理差距主要源于语言理解失败，即模型无法将多语言输入意义表示到主导语言（英语）中。评估了多种检测方法，发现监督方法效果最好。基于此提出选择性翻译策略，仅在检测到理解失败时将多语言输入翻译成英语。

Result: 实验结果显示选择性翻译能够显著缩小多语言推理差距，在仅翻译约20%输入的情况下，达到接近全翻译的性能水平。

Conclusion: 理解失败是多语言推理差距的主要原因，可以通过检测和选择性缓解来解决。这为理解差距的起源提供了关键见解，并为实现更公平的多语言推理提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Reasoning language models (RLMs) achieve strong performance on complex
reasoning tasks, yet they still suffer from a multilingual reasoning gap,
performing better in high-resource languages than in low-resource ones. While
recent efforts have reduced this gap, its underlying causes remain largely
unexplored. In this paper, we address this by showing that the multilingual
reasoning gap largely stems from failures in language understanding-the model's
inability to represent the multilingual input meaning into the dominant
language (i.e., English) within its reasoning trace. This motivates us to
examine whether understanding failures can be detected, as this ability could
help mitigate the multilingual reasoning gap. To this end, we evaluate a range
of detection methods and find that understanding failures can indeed be
identified, with supervised approaches performing best. Building on this, we
propose Selective Translation, a simple yet effective strategy that translates
the multilingual input into English only when an understanding failure is
detected. Experimental results show that Selective Translation bridges the
multilingual reasoning gap, achieving near full-translation performance while
using translation for only about 20% of inputs. Together, our work demonstrates
that understanding failures are the primary cause of the multilingual reasoning
gap and can be detected and selectively mitigated, providing key insight into
its origin and a promising path toward more equitable multilingual reasoning.

*Yi-Long Lu,Jiajun Song,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs中的评价判断沿一个主导维度——Valence-Assent Axis（VAA）进行计算，该轴同时编码主观价值和事实认同，并作为控制信号引导生成过程，可能导致系统性偏见和幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨智能系统（包括生物和人工智能）的判断是依赖专门模块还是统一领域通用资源，特别是在LLMs中发现可解码的神经表征后，这些表征是否真正独立仍存疑问。

Method: 通过一系列LLMs实验，识别评价判断的主导维度VAA，并进行直接干预来验证其功能。

Result: 发现VAA作为统一表征创建了关键依赖关系，引导生成过程构建与其评价状态一致的论证，即使牺牲事实准确性。

Conclusion: 这种机制（推理从属）揭示了促进一致性判断的架构如何系统性地削弱忠实推理，为系统性偏见和幻觉提供了机制解释。

Abstract: A central architectural question for both biological and artificial
intelligence is whether judgment relies on specialized modules or a unified,
domain-general resource. While the discovery of decodable neural
representations for distinct concepts in Large Language Models (LLMs) has
suggested a modular architecture, whether these representations are truly
independent systems remains an open question. Here we provide evidence for a
convergent architecture. Across a range of LLMs, we find that diverse
evaluative judgments are computed along a dominant dimension, which we term the
Valence-Assent Axis (VAA). This axis jointly encodes subjective valence ("what
is good") and the model's assent to factual claims ("what is true"). Through
direct interventions, we show this unified representation creates a critical
dependency: the VAA functions as a control signal that steers the generative
process to construct a rationale consistent with its evaluative state, even at
the cost of factual accuracy. This mechanism, which we term the subordination
of reasoning, shifts the process of reasoning from impartial inference toward
goal-directed justification. Our discovery offers a mechanistic account for
systemic bias and hallucination, revealing how an architecture that promotes
coherent judgment can systematically undermine faithful reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TransAlign是一种新的词对齐器，利用大规模多语言机器翻译模型的编码器，在基于机器翻译的跨语言迁移中显著优于现有词对齐和非词对齐的标签投影方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大多数世界语言缺乏大规模训练数据的情况下，基于翻译的跨语言迁移策略需要词对齐来进行标签投影。现有方法主要依赖mBERT或LaBSE等编码器语言模型，而机器翻译模型在词对齐方面的潜力未被充分挖掘。

Method: 提出TransAlign词对齐器，利用大规模多语言机器翻译模型的编码器来提取词对齐信息，而不是传统的基于编码器语言模型的方法。

Result: TransAlign不仅实现了强大的词对齐性能，而且在基于机器翻译的跨语言迁移中显著优于流行的词对齐方法和最先进的非词对齐标签投影方法。

Conclusion: 机器翻译模型的编码器可以有效地用于词对齐任务，为跨语言迁移中的标签投影提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: In the absence of sizable training data for most world languages and NLP
tasks, translation-based strategies such as translate-test -- evaluating on
noisy source language data translated from the target language -- and
translate-train -- training on noisy target language data translated from the
source language -- have been established as competitive approaches for
cross-lingual transfer (XLT). For token classification tasks, these strategies
require label projection: mapping the labels from each token in the original
sentence to its counterpart(s) in the translation. To this end, it is common to
leverage multilingual word aligners (WAs) derived from encoder language models
such as mBERT or LaBSE. Despite obvious associations between machine
translation (MT) and WA, research on extracting alignments with MT models is
largely limited to exploiting cross-attention in encoder-decoder architectures,
yielding poor WA results. In this work, in contrast, we propose TransAlign, a
novel word aligner that utilizes the encoder of a massively multilingual MT
model. We show that TransAlign not only achieves strong WA performance but
substantially outperforms popular WA and state-of-the-art non-WA-based label
projection methods in MT-based XLT for token classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要操纵隐藏表示来引导LLM生成，而本工作利用这些表示作为判别信号来指导树结构响应空间的探索。

Method: 在节点扩展时使用分类器作为评分和排序机制，优先扩展高分候选；完成树扩展后收集所有分支答案形成候选池；提出分支聚合方法，通过聚合CoT分数在所有支持分支上进行边缘化，从而识别最优答案。

Result: 实验结果显示，该框架的全面探索不仅覆盖有效推理链，还能有效识别它们，在多个算术推理基准上实现了显著改进。

Conclusion: ThoughtProbe框架通过利用LLM隐藏推理特征进行树结构探索和分支聚合，显著提升了推理性能。

Abstract: This paper introduces ThoughtProbe, a novel inference time framework that
leverages the hidden reasoning features of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
improve their reasoning performance. Unlike previous works that manipulate the
hidden representations to steer LLM generation, we harness them as
discriminative signals to guide the tree structured response space exploration.
In each node expansion, a classifier serves as a scoring and ranking mechanism
that efficiently allocates computational resources by prioritizing higher score
candidates for continuation. After completing the tree expansion, we collect
answers from all branches to form a candidate answer pool. We then propose a
branch aggregation method that marginalizes over all supporting branches by
aggregating their CoT scores, thereby identifying the optimal answer from the
pool. Experimental results show that our framework's comprehensive exploration
not only covers valid reasoning chains but also effectively identifies them,
achieving significant improvements across multiple arithmetic reasoning
benchmarks.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive systematic survey of the application of natural
language processing (NLP) along the entire battery life cycle, instead of one
stage or method, and introduce a novel technical language processing (TLP)
framework for the EU's proposed digital battery passport (DBP) and other
general battery predictions. We follow the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method and employ three reputable

and Electronics Engineers Xplore (IEEE Xplore), and Scopus. Consequently, we
assessed 274 scientific papers before the critical review of the final 66
relevant papers. We publicly provide artifacts of the review for validation and
reproducibility. The findings show that new NLP tasks are emerging in the
battery domain, which facilitate materials discovery and other stages of the
life cycle. Notwithstanding, challenges remain, such as the lack of standard
benchmarks. Our proposed TLP framework, which incorporates agentic AI and
optimized prompts, will be apt for tackling some of the challenges.

Method: 基于关联记忆范式联合更新MLP和注意力模块，使用知识平衡策略按模块贡献度分配更新幅度

Result: 在标准基准测试中，IntAttn-Edit实现了更高的编辑成功率、更好的泛化能力和更强的知识保持能力

Conclusion: 注意力模块在事实知识存储中起重要作用，联合更新MLP和注意力模块的知识平衡策略能显著提升知识编辑效果

Abstract: Knowledge editing has emerged as an efficient approach for updating factual
knowledge in large language models (LLMs). It typically locates knowledge
storage modules and then modifies their parameters. However, most existing
methods focus on the weights of multilayer perceptron (MLP) modules, which are
often identified as the main repositories of factual information. Other
components, such as attention (Attn) modules, are often ignored during editing.
This imbalance can leave residual outdated knowledge and limit editing
effectiveness. We perform comprehensive knowledge localization experiments on
advanced LLMs and find that Attn modules play a substantial role in factual
knowledge storage and retrieval, especially in earlier layers. Based on these
insights, we propose IntAttn-Edit, a method that extends the associative memory
paradigm to jointly update both MLP and Attn modules. Our approach uses a
knowledge balancing strategy that allocates update magnitudes in proportion to
each module's measured contribution to knowledge storage. Experiments on
standard benchmarks show that IntAttn-Edit achieves higher edit success, better
generalization, and stronger knowledge preservation than prior methods. Further
analysis shows that the balancing strategy keeps editing performance within an
optimal range across diverse settings.

of the NLP landscape for Tamazight, examining recent progress in computational
resources, and the emergence of community-driven approaches to address
persistent data scarcity. Launched in 2024, awaldigital.org platform addresses
the underrepresentation of Tamazight in digital spaces through a collaborative
platform enabling speakers to contribute translation and voice data. We analyze
18 months of community engagement, revealing significant barriers to
participation including limited confidence in written Tamazight and ongoing
standardization challenges. Despite widespread positive reception, actual data
contribution remained concentrated among linguists and activists. The modest
scale of community contributions -- 6,421 translation pairs and 3 hours of
speech data -- highlights the limitations of applying standard crowdsourcing
approaches to languages with complex sociolinguistic contexts. We are working
on improved open-source MT models using the collected data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI代理系统依赖外部记忆数据库提供个性化体验，但存在记忆冗余、记忆陈旧和记忆-上下文整合差的问题，主要由于交互过程中缺乏有效的记忆更新机制。

Method: 采用贝叶斯启发的记忆更新算法和记忆熵概念，使代理能够通过最小化全局熵来自主维护动态更新的记忆向量数据库。

Result: 实验结果表明，该系统在个性化、逻辑一致性和准确性方面表现优异，消融研究进一步验证了贝叶斯启发更新机制在缓解记忆膨胀方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为长期记忆系统的设计提供了新的见解，特别是在情感场景下的记忆管理方面。

Abstract: Advances in large language models are making personalized AI agents a new
research focus. While current agent systems primarily rely on personalized
external memory databases to deliver customized experiences, they face
challenges such as memory redundancy, memory staleness, and poor memory-context
integration, largely due to the lack of effective memory updates during
interaction. To tackle these issues, we propose a new memory management system
designed for affective scenarios. Our approach employs a Bayesian-inspired
memory update algorithm with the concept of memory entropy, enabling the agent
to autonomously maintain a dynamically updated memory vector database by
minimizing global entropy to provide more personalized services. To better
evaluate the system's effectiveness in this context, we propose DABench, a
benchmark focusing on emotional expression and emotional change toward objects.
Experimental results demonstrate that, our system achieves superior performance
in personalization, logical coherence, and accuracy. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of the Bayesian-inspired update mechanism in
alleviating memory bloat. Our work offers new insights into the design of
long-term memory systems.

TL;DR: VCORE是一个基于优化理论的长链思维监督框架，通过方差控制的优化重加权方法，自适应分配不同token的监督权重，提升大语言模型的推理泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准交叉熵损失对所有token一视同仁，忽略了推理轨迹中不同token的异质贡献，导致监督分配不当和泛化能力弱，特别是在复杂的长形式推理任务中。

Method: 将链式思维监督重新表述为约束优化问题，采用优化理论视角，通过方差控制的优化重加权方法，实现原则性和自适应的token监督分配。

Result: 在数学和编程基准测试中，使用Qwen3系列和LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct模型，VCORE在域内和域外设置下均显著优于现有token重加权方法，并为后续强化学习提供了更有效的初始化。

Conclusion: VCORE通过优化理论框架改进了链式思维监督，为提升大语言模型推理能力提供了更强的基础，并可作为强化学习的更好初始化。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long chain-of-thought (CoT) trajectories has
emerged as a crucial technique for enhancing the reasoning abilities of large
language models (LLMs). However, the standard cross-entropy loss treats all
tokens equally, ignoring their heterogeneous contributions across a reasoning
trajectory. This uniform treatment leads to misallocated supervision and weak
generalization, especially in complex, long-form reasoning tasks. To address
this, we introduce \textbf{V}ariance-\textbf{C}ontrolled
\textbf{O}ptimization-based \textbf{RE}weighting (VCORE), a principled
framework that reformulates CoT supervision as a constrained optimization
problem. By adopting an optimization-theoretic perspective, VCORE enables a
principled and adaptive allocation of supervision across tokens, thereby
aligning the training objective more closely with the goal of robust reasoning
generalization. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that VCORE consistently
outperforms existing token reweighting methods. Across both in-domain and
out-of-domain settings, VCORE achieves substantial performance gains on
mathematical and coding benchmarks, using models from the Qwen3 series (4B, 8B,
32B) and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct. Moreover, we show that VCORE serves as a more
effective initialization for subsequent reinforcement learning, establishing a
stronger foundation for advancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The Code
will be released at https://github.com/coder-gx/VCORE.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的协作推理框架，利用扩散语言模型生成候选思维，大语言模型评估质量，在保持推理质量的同时显著降低计算负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的自回归生成范式导致推理性能随测试时间计算呈次优扩展，需要过多计算开销。扩散语言模型能通过单次前向传播并行去噪高效生成多样样本，可缓解自回归生成的计算负担。

Method: 使用扩散语言模型生成候选中间思维，大语言模型评估这些思维的质量，形成协作推理框架。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，该框架在复杂推理任务上实现了强大性能。

Conclusion: 该协作推理框架为未来研究提供了有前景的方向，在保持质量的同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have witnessed remarkable
advancements, with the test-time scaling law consistently enhancing the
reasoning capabilities. Through systematic evaluation and exploration of a
diverse spectrum of intermediate thoughts, LLMs demonstrate the potential to
generate deliberate reasoning steps, thereby substantially enhancing reasoning
accuracy. However, LLMs' autoregressive generation paradigm results in
reasoning performance scaling sub-optimally with test-time computation, often
requiring excessive computational overhead to propose thoughts while yielding
only marginal performance gains. In contrast, diffusion language models (DLMs)
can efficiently produce diverse samples through parallel denoising in a single
forward pass, inspiring us to leverage them for proposing intermediate
thoughts, thereby alleviating the computational burden associated with
autoregressive generation while maintaining quality. In this work, we propose
an efficient collaborative reasoning framework, leveraging DLMs to generate
candidate thoughts and LLMs to evaluate their quality. Experiments across
diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our framework achieves strong performance
in complex reasoning tasks, offering a promising direction for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究计算嵌入与人类语义判断在英语复合词处理中的对齐程度，推动计算心理语言学发展。

Method: 使用GloVe和BERT嵌入，与人类LMD和ST评分进行比较，通过关联强度、频率和可预测性指标计算嵌入衍生的LMD和ST指标，使用Spearman相关和回归分析评估关系。

Result: BERT嵌入比GloVe更好地捕捉组合语义，可预测性评分是语义透明度的强预测因子。

Conclusion: 研究明确了驱动复合词处理的因素，为基于嵌入的语义建模提供了见解，推动了计算心理语言学的发展。

Abstract: This study investigates how well computational embeddings align with human
semantic judgments in the processing of English compound words. We compare
static word vectors (GloVe) and contextualized embeddings (BERT) against human
ratings of lexeme meaning dominance (LMD) and semantic transparency (ST) drawn
from a psycholinguistic dataset. Using measures of association strength
(Edinburgh Associative Thesaurus), frequency (BNC), and predictability (LaDEC),
we compute embedding-derived LMD and ST metrics and assess their relationships
with human judgments via Spearmans correlation and regression analyses. Our
results show that BERT embeddings better capture compositional semantics than
GloVe, and that predictability ratings are strong predictors of semantic
transparency in both human and model data. These findings advance computational
psycholinguistics by clarifying the factors that drive compound word processing
and offering insights into embedding-based semantic modeling.

TL;DR: 本研究在低资源自然语言任务中比较了两种因果域泛化方法：因果数据增强和不变因果表示学习，发现它们都能提升对未见域的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中训练和测试数据分布不一致的问题在低资源环境下尤为严重，需要开发能够跨域泛化的方法。

Method: 1. 因果数据增强：自动生成反事实样本来改善对伪相关的鲁棒性；2. 不变因果表示学习：使用DINER框架学习跨域不变的因果表示。

Result: 两种方法都增强了未见域的鲁棒性：因果数据增强在情感分类中带来一致的跨域准确率提升；DINER在多语言情感分析中改善了分布外性能，但在不同语言间效果有差异。

Conclusion: 因果方法在低资源自然语言处理中能有效提升域泛化能力，但不同方法在不同任务和语言中的效果存在差异。

Abstract: Machine learning models typically assume that training and test data follow
the same distribution, an assumption that often fails in real-world scenarios
due to distribution shifts. This issue is especially pronounced in low-resource
settings, where data scarcity and limited domain diversity hinder robust
generalization. Domain generalization (DG) approaches address this challenge by
learning features that remain invariant across domains, often using causal
mechanisms to improve model robustness. In this study, we examine two distinct
causal DG techniques in low-resource natural language tasks. First, we
investigate a causal data augmentation (CDA) approach that automatically
generates counterfactual examples to improve robustness to spurious
correlations. We apply this method to sentiment classification on the
NaijaSenti Twitter corpus, expanding the training data with semantically
equivalent paraphrases to simulate controlled distribution shifts. Second, we
explore an invariant causal representation learning (ICRL) approach using the
DINER framework, originally proposed for debiasing aspect-based sentiment
analysis. We adapt DINER to a multilingual setting. Our findings demonstrate
that both approaches enhance robustness to unseen domains: counterfactual data
augmentation yields consistent cross-domain accuracy gains in sentiment
classification, while causal representation learning with DINER improves
out-of-distribution performance in multilingual sentiment analysis, albeit with
varying gains across languages.

TL;DR: BiSparse-AAS结合稀疏注意力、自适应跨度与双线性注意力，解决了Transformer在长文档摘要中的二次复杂度问题，显著提升了摘要性能与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer架构在文本摘要中表现优异，但其二次计算复杂度限制了在长文档上的可扩展性，需要更高效的注意力机制。

Method: 提出BiSparse-AAS框架，整合稀疏注意力（降低计算成本）、自适应跨度（动态调整注意力范围）和双线性注意力（建模复杂token交互）。

Result: 在CNN/DailyMail和XSum数据集上分别实现约68.1%和52.6%的ROUGE平均提升，在OpenWebText和Gigaword数据集上保持强劲性能。

Conclusion: BiSparse-AAS通过解决效率、可扩展性和长序列建模问题，为实际文本摘要应用提供了统一的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures have advanced text summarization, yet their
quadratic complexity limits scalability on long documents. This paper
introduces BiSparse-AAS (Bilinear Sparse Attention with Adaptive Spans), a
novel framework that combines sparse attention, adaptive spans, and bilinear
attention to address these limitations. Sparse attention reduces computational
costs by focusing on the most relevant parts of the input, while adaptive spans
dynamically adjust the attention ranges. Bilinear attention complements both by
modeling complex token interactions within this refined context. BiSparse-AAS
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both extractive and
abstractive summarization tasks, achieving average ROUGE improvements of about
68.1% on CNN/DailyMail and 52.6% on XSum, while maintaining strong performance
on OpenWebText and Gigaword datasets. By addressing efficiency, scalability,
and long-sequence modeling, BiSparse-AAS provides a unified, practical solution
for real-world text summarization applications.

TL;DR: SQLSpace是一种人类可解释、可泛化、紧凑的文本到SQL示例表示方法，通过最小人工干预获得，可用于评估文本到SQL模型的多个方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种能够深入分析文本到SQL模型性能的表示方法，超越简单的准确率评估，揭示基准测试的组成差异和模型性能模式。

Method: 通过最小人工干预从文本到SQL示例中推导出SQLSpace表示，支持三种用例：基准测试组成对比、细粒度性能分析和基于正确性估计的查询重写。

Result: SQLSpace能够揭示不同基准测试之间的组成差异，暴露仅凭准确率无法发现的性能模式，并支持查询成功建模。

Conclusion: SQLSpace为文本到SQL评估提供了比原始示例更深入的分析能力，在基准对比、性能分析和模型改进方面具有实用价值。

Abstract: We introduce SQLSpace, a human-interpretable, generalizable, compact
representation for text-to-SQL examples derived with minimal human
intervention. We demonstrate the utility of these representations in evaluation
with three use cases: (i) closely comparing and contrasting the composition of
popular text-to-SQL benchmarks to identify unique dimensions of examples they
evaluate, (ii) understanding model performance at a granular level beyond
overall accuracy scores, and (iii) improving model performance through targeted
query rewriting based on learned correctness estimation. We show that SQLSpace
enables analysis that would be difficult with raw examples alone: it reveals
compositional differences between benchmarks, exposes performance patterns
obscured by accuracy alone, and supports modeling of query success.

TL;DR: 提出患者中心摘要(PCS)新标准，评估开源LLM在从医患对话生成患者价值观摘要方面的表现，发现模型在完整性和流畅度上接近人类水平，但在准确性和患者中心性方面仍有差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有临床摘要主要关注患者生物学信息，而忽视了患者的偏好、价值观、愿望和关切，无法实现真正的以患者为中心的护理。

Method: 通过英国患者和临床医生群体的半结构化访谈制定PCS标注指南，使用88个房颤咨询创建黄金标准，评估5个开源LLM在零样本和少样本提示下的表现。

Result: 患者强调生活方式、社会支持、近期压力源和护理价值观；临床医生需要简洁的功能、心理社会和情感背景信息。最佳零样本性能由Mistral-8B和Llama-3.1-8B实现，少样本最佳为Llama-3.1-8B。

Conclusion: LLM在生成患者中心摘要方面显示出潜力，但在准确性和患者中心性方面仍需改进，需要进一步研究以更好地捕捉患者价值观。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly demonstrating the potential to
reach human-level performance in generating clinical summaries from
patient-clinician conversations. However, these summaries often focus on
patients' biology rather than their preferences, values, wishes, and concerns.
To achieve patient-centered care, we propose a new standard for Artificial
Intelligence (AI) clinical summarization tasks: Patient-Centered Summaries
(PCS). Our objective was to develop a framework to generate PCS that capture
patient values and ensure clinical utility and to assess whether current
open-source LLMs can achieve human-level performance in this task. We used a
mixed-methods process. Two Patient and Public Involvement groups (10 patients
and 8 clinicians) in the United Kingdom participated in semi-structured
interviews exploring what personal and contextual information should be
included in clinical summaries and how it should be structured for clinical
use. Findings informed annotation guidelines used by eight clinicians to create
gold-standard PCS from 88 atrial fibrillation consultations. Sixteen
consultations were used to refine a prompt aligned with the guidelines. Five
open-source LLMs (Llama-3.2-3B, Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-8B, Gemma-3-4B, and
Qwen3-8B) generated summaries for 72 consultations using zero-shot and few-shot
prompting, evaluated with ROUGE-L, BERTScore, and qualitative metrics. Patients
emphasized lifestyle routines, social support, recent stressors, and care
values. Clinicians sought concise functional, psychosocial, and emotional
context. The best zero-shot performance was achieved by Mistral-8B (ROUGE-L
0.189) and Llama-3.1-8B (BERTScore 0.673); the best few-shot by Llama-3.1-8B
(ROUGE-L 0.206, BERTScore 0.683). Completeness and fluency were similar between
experts and models, while correctness and patient-centeredness favored human
PCS.

TL;DR: DialectalArabicMMLU是一个新的基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在阿拉伯语方言上的性能，包含15K个跨5种主要方言的问答对，覆盖32个学术和专业领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的阿拉伯语和多语言基准主要关注现代标准阿拉伯语(MSA)，而日常交流中广泛使用的方言变体却缺乏代表性评估。

Method: 通过手动翻译和改编MMLU-Redux框架中的3K个选择题，将其转化为五种主要阿拉伯语方言（叙利亚、埃及、阿联酋、沙特和摩洛哥），共产生15K个问答对。

Result: 评估了19个阿拉伯语和多语言LLM（1B-13B参数），发现不同方言间存在显著的性能差异，揭示了方言泛化方面的持续差距。

Conclusion: DialectalArabicMMLU提供了首个统一的人工策划资源，用于衡量阿拉伯语方言理解能力，从而促进更包容的评估和未来模型发展。

Abstract: We present DialectalArabicMMLU, a new benchmark for evaluating the
performance of large language models (LLMs) across Arabic dialects. While
recently developed Arabic and multilingual benchmarks have advanced LLM
evaluation for Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), dialectal varieties remain
underrepresented despite their prevalence in everyday communication.
DialectalArabicMMLU extends the MMLU-Redux framework through manual translation
and adaptation of 3K multiple-choice question-answer pairs into five major
dialects (Syrian, Egyptian, Emirati, Saudi, and Moroccan), yielding a total of
15K QA pairs across 32 academic and professional domains (22K QA pairs when
also including English and MSA). The benchmark enables systematic assessment of
LLM reasoning and comprehension beyond MSA, supporting both task-based and
linguistic analysis. We evaluate 19 open-weight Arabic and multilingual LLMs
(1B-13B parameters) and report substantial performance variation across
dialects, revealing persistent gaps in dialectal generalization.
DialectalArabicMMLU provides the first unified, human-curated resource for
measuring dialectal understanding in Arabic, thus promoting more inclusive
evaluation and future model development.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了在荷兰语、罗马尼亚语和西班牙语三种低资源语言中，通过领域特定语料库的进一步预训练如何提升医疗NLP任务的性能。研究发现领域适应显著提高了任务表现，临床领域适应的模型优于通用生物医学领域适应的模型，并观察到跨语言迁移能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多语言医疗应用中，领域特定的自然语言处理工具有限，特别是对于低资源语言。虽然多语言BERT提供了缓解语言差距的潜力，但低资源语言的医疗NLP任务仍未充分探索。

Method: 进行了四个实验来创建医疗领域模型，通过领域特定语料库的进一步预训练。然后将这些模型在三个下游任务上进行微调：荷兰临床笔记中的自动患者筛查、罗马尼亚和西班牙临床笔记中的命名实体识别。

Result: 领域适应显著增强了任务性能。临床领域适应的模型优于更通用的生物医学领域适应模型。观察到跨语言迁移能力的证据。

Conclusion: 这些发现突出了领域适应和跨语言能力在医疗NLP中的可行性。在低资源语言设置下，这些发现可以为开发多语言医疗NLP系统提供有意义的指导，以缓解训练数据不足并提高模型性能。

Abstract: In multilingual healthcare applications, the availability of domain-specific
natural language processing(NLP) tools is limited, especially for low-resource
languages. Although multilingual bidirectional encoder representations from
transformers (BERT) offers a promising motivation to mitigate the language gap,
the medical NLP tasks in low-resource languages are still underexplored.
Therefore, this study investigates how further pre-training on domain-specific
corpora affects model performance on medical tasks, focusing on three
languages: Dutch, Romanian and Spanish. In terms of further pre-training, we
conducted four experiments to create medical domain models. Then, these models
were fine-tuned on three downstream tasks: Automated patient screening in Dutch
clinical notes, named entity recognition in Romanian and Spanish clinical
notes. Results show that domain adaptation significantly enhanced task
performance. Furthermore, further differentiation of domains, e.g. clinical and
general biomedical domains, resulted in diverse performances. The clinical
domain-adapted model outperformed the more general biomedical domain-adapted
model. Moreover, we observed evidence of cross-lingual transferability.
Moreover, we also conducted further investigations to explore potential reasons
contributing to these performance differences. These findings highlight the
feasibility of domain adaptation and cross-lingual ability in medical NLP.
Within the low-resource language settings, these findings can provide
meaningful guidance for developing multilingual medical NLP systems to mitigate
the lack of training data and thereby improve the model performance.

TL;DR: 使用CPO进行数据高效的领域适应，通过将基础模型的原始输出作为“拒绝”翻译、人工批准的TM条目作为“选择”翻译来合成偏好对，仅用14.7k偏好对就达到接近160k+ SFT样本的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs需要适应领域特定要求，但仅依赖SFT成本高昂，因此研究如何通过CPO模拟后编辑工作流实现数据高效的领域适应。

Method: 应用CPO模拟后编辑工作流，将基础模型的原始输出作为“拒绝”翻译，人工批准的翻译记忆条目作为“选择”翻译，合成偏好对来提供直接反馈。

Result: 在英语-巴西葡萄牙语和英语-韩语实验中，仅使用14.7k偏好对，模型性能就接近使用160k+样本的SFT训练模型，显示出显著的数据效率。

Conclusion: 该方法在机器翻译中有效，且可自然推广到其他生成任务，其中模型的初始草稿可作为与黄金参考对比的信号。

Abstract: LLMs often require adaptation to domain-specific requirements, a process that
can be expensive when relying solely on SFT. We present an empirical study on
applying CPO to simulate a post-editing workflow for data-efficient domain
adaptation. Our approach synthesizes preference pairs by treating the base
model's own raw output as the 'rejected' translation and the human-approved TM
entry as the 'chosen' one. This method provides direct feedback on the model's
current knowledge, guiding it to align with domain-specific standards.
Experiments in English-Brazilian Portuguese and English-Korean show that, by
using just 14.7k preference pairs, the model achieves performance close to that
of a model trained on 160k+ samples with SFT, demonstrating significant data
efficiency. Although we showcase its effectiveness in MT, this application of
CPO naturally generalizes to other generative tasks where a model's initial
drafts can serve as a contrastive signal against a golden reference.

TL;DR: MARAG-R1是一个基于强化学习的多工具RAG框架，通过动态协调多种检索机制来解决传统单检索器RAG系统信息获取受限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统依赖单一检索器和固定top-k选择，限制了对外部知识的全面访问，特别是在需要语料库级别推理的任务中成为主要瓶颈。

Method: 提出MARAG-R1框架，配备四种检索工具（语义搜索、关键词搜索、过滤和聚合），通过两阶段训练（监督微调+强化学习）让模型学习如何和何时使用这些工具。

Result: 在GlobalQA、HotpotQA和2WikiMultiHopQA上的实验表明，MARAG-R1显著优于强基线方法，在语料库级别推理任务中取得了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: 多工具RAG框架能够有效提升LLMs对外部知识的访问能力，通过动态协调不同检索机制实现更全面和精确的信息获取。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at reasoning and generation but are
inherently limited by static pretraining data, resulting in factual
inaccuracies and weak adaptability to new information. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) addresses this issue by grounding LLMs in external knowledge;
However, the effectiveness of RAG critically depends on whether the model can
adequately access relevant information. Existing RAG systems rely on a single
retriever with fixed top-k selection, restricting access to a narrow and static
subset of the corpus. As a result, this single-retriever paradigm has become
the primary bottleneck for comprehensive external information acquisition,
especially in tasks requiring corpus-level reasoning. To overcome this
limitation, we propose MARAG-R1, a reinforcement-learned multi-tool RAG
framework that enables LLMs to dynamically coordinate multiple retrieval
mechanisms for broader and more precise information access. MARAG-R1 equips the
model with four retrieval tools -- semantic search, keyword search, filtering,
and aggregation -- and learns both how and when to use them through a two-stage
training process: supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning.
This design allows the model to interleave reasoning and retrieval,
progressively gathering sufficient evidence for corpus-level synthesis.
Experiments on GlobalQA, HotpotQA, and 2WikiMultiHopQA demonstrate that
MARAG-R1 substantially outperforms strong baselines and achieves new
state-of-the-art results in corpus-level reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: SpecAttn是一种无需训练的方法，通过利用推测解码中草稿模型计算的注意力权重来识别重要token，实现预训练transformer中的高效稀疏注意力，减少75%的KV缓存访问。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在推理时面临计算瓶颈，特别是随着上下文长度增加，自注意力机制的二次复杂度成为主要问题。

Method: 使用KL散度进行草稿与目标模型层对齐、GPU优化的无排序top-p token选择算法、基于预测的动态KV缓存剪枝。

Result: 在PG-19数据集上，KV缓存访问减少超过75%，困惑度仅增加15.29%，显著优于现有稀疏注意力方法。

Conclusion: 推测执行可以增强为提供近似验证而不会显著降低性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant computational bottlenecks
during inference due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention mechanisms,
particularly as context lengths increase. We introduce SpecAttn, a novel
training-free approach that seamlessly integrates with existing speculative
decoding techniques to enable efficient sparse attention in pre-trained
transformers. Our key insight is to exploit the attention weights already
computed by the draft model during speculative decoding to identify important
tokens for the target model, eliminating redundant computation while
maintaining output quality. SpecAttn employs three core techniques: KL
divergence-based layer alignment between draft and target models, a
GPU-optimized sorting-free algorithm for top-p token selection from draft
attention patterns, and dynamic key-value cache pruning guided by these
predictions. By leveraging the computational work already performed in standard
speculative decoding pipelines, SpecAttn achieves over 75% reduction in
key-value cache accesses with a mere 15.29% increase in perplexity on the PG-19
dataset, significantly outperforming existing sparse attention methods. Our
approach demonstrates that speculative execution can be enhanced to provide
approximate verification without significant performance degradation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合主动的文化知识标注方法CultureCartography，通过LLM低置信度问题初始化标注，让人类填补知识空白并引导至重要文化主题，相比传统方法能更有效地识别LLM缺失的文化知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM需要特定文化知识来安全有效地服务全球用户，但这些知识可能在预训练中缺失。现有方法要么是研究人员定义问题，要么是用户主动提供数据，缺乏有效的混合协作。

Method: 提出CultureCartography方法：LLM用低置信度答案的问题初始化标注，明确其先验知识和知识空白；人类受访者填补空白并通过直接编辑引导模型关注重要主题；实现为CultureExplorer工具。

Result: 相比人类回答LLM提出问题的基线，CultureExplorer能更有效地产生DeepSeek R1和GPT-4o等领先模型缺失的知识（即使有网络搜索）；用这些数据微调Llama-3.1-8B在相关文化基准上的准确率提升高达19.2%。

Conclusion: 混合主动方法能更有效地识别和填补LLM的文化知识空白，通过人类引导和LLM主动提问的结合，显著提升模型在文化相关任务上的表现。

Abstract: To serve global users safely and productively, LLMs need culture-specific
knowledge that might not be learned during pre-training. How do we find such
knowledge that is (1) salient to in-group users, but (2) unknown to LLMs? The
most common solutions are single-initiative: either researchers define
challenging questions that users passively answer (traditional annotation), or
users actively produce data that researchers structure as benchmarks (knowledge
extraction). The process would benefit from mixed-initiative collaboration,
where users guide the process to meaningfully reflect their cultures, and LLMs
steer the process towards more challenging questions that meet the researcher's
goals. We propose a mixed-initiative methodology called CultureCartography.
Here, an LLM initializes annotation with questions for which it has
low-confidence answers, making explicit both its prior knowledge and the gaps
therein. This allows a human respondent to fill these gaps and steer the model
towards salient topics through direct edits. We implement this methodology as a
tool called CultureExplorer. Compared to a baseline where humans answer
LLM-proposed questions, we find that CultureExplorer more effectively produces
knowledge that leading models like DeepSeek R1 and GPT-4o are missing, even
with web search. Fine-tuning on this data boosts the accuracy of Llama-3.1-8B
by up to 19.2% on related culture benchmarks.

Result: CALM显著改善了性能-计算权衡，以显著更低的计算成本实现了强离散基线的性能。

Conclusion: 下一向量预测是构建超高效语言模型的有力且可扩展的途径。

Abstract: The efficiency of large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally limited by
their sequential, token-by-token generation process. We argue that overcoming
this bottleneck requires a new design axis for LLM scaling: increasing the
semantic bandwidth of each generative step. To this end, we introduce
Continuous Autoregressive Language Models (CALM), a paradigm shift from
discrete next-token prediction to continuous next-vector prediction. CALM uses
a high-fidelity autoencoder to compress a chunk of K tokens into a single
continuous vector, from which the original tokens can be reconstructed with
over 99.9\% accuracy. This allows us to model language as a sequence of
continuous vectors instead of discrete tokens, which reduces the number of
generative steps by a factor of K. The paradigm shift necessitates a new
modeling toolkit; therefore, we develop a comprehensive likelihood-free
framework that enables robust training, evaluation, and controllable sampling
in the continuous domain. Experiments show that CALM significantly improves the
performance-compute trade-off, achieving the performance of strong discrete
baselines at a significantly lower computational cost. More importantly, these
findings establish next-vector prediction as a powerful and scalable pathway
towards ultra-efficient language models. Code:

### [45] [Do Vision-Language Models Measure Up? Benchmarking Visual Measurement Reading with MeasureBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26865)
*Fenfen Lin,Yesheng Liu,Haiyu Xu,Chen Yue,Zheqi He,Mingxuan Zhao,Miguel Hu Chen,Jiakang Liu,JG Yao,Xi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MeasureBench基准测试，评估视觉语言模型在读取测量仪器方面的能力，发现即使是前沿模型也在这方面表现不佳，主要问题是定位指针位置错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类读取测量仪器相对容易且不需要太多专业知识，但当前视觉语言模型在这方面表现令人惊讶地差，需要系统评估和改进。

Method: 开发了MeasureBench基准测试，包含真实世界和合成图像，并建立了可扩展的数据合成流程，能够程序化生成具有可控视觉外观的测量仪器。

Result: 评估显示最先进的视觉语言模型普遍在测量读取方面表现不佳，主要失败模式是指示器定位错误，导致尽管有合理的文本推理但产生大的数值误差。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型在细粒度空间定位方面存在根本性限制，该资源有助于推动视觉基础计算能力和精确空间感知的发展。

Abstract: Reading measurement instruments is effortless for humans and requires
relatively little domain expertise, yet it remains surprisingly challenging for
current vision-language models (VLMs) as we find in preliminary evaluation. In
this work, we introduce MeasureBench, a benchmark on visual measurement reading
covering both real-world and synthesized images of various types of
measurements, along with an extensible pipeline for data synthesis. Our
pipeline procedurally generates a specified type of gauge with controllable
visual appearance, enabling scalable variation in key details such as pointers,
scales, fonts, lighting, and clutter. Evaluation on popular proprietary and
open-weight VLMs shows that even the strongest frontier VLMs struggle
measurement reading in general. A consistent failure mode is indicator
localization: models can read digits or labels but misidentify the key
positions of pointers or alignments, leading to big numeric errors despite
plausible textual reasoning. We have also conducted preliminary experiments
with reinforcement learning over synthetic data, and find encouraging results
on in-domain synthetic subset but less promising for real-world images. Our
analysis highlights a fundamental limitation of current VLMs in fine-grained
spatial grounding. We hope this resource can help future advances on visually
grounded numeracy and precise spatial perception of VLMs, bridging the gap
between recognizing numbers and measuring the world.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一个用于多机构定量CT的领域自适应transformer分割框架，通过对抗对齐和统计对齐解决跨机构数据分布差异问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度网络在不同数据集间的领域偏移问题，确保骨质疏松研究和定量指标在多中心间的可重复性。

Method: 在3D TransUNet骨干网络中集成梯度反转层的对抗对齐和最大均值差异的统计对齐，平衡不变性和细粒度对齐。

Result: 在包含1,024个Tulane大学和384个Rochester扫描的大型髋部骨折研究队列上进行训练和验证。

Conclusion: 该双机制方法实现了扫描仪无关的特征学习，同时保留解剖细节，为多中心骨质疏松研究提供可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) plays a crucial role in assessing bone
strength and fracture risk by enabling volumetric analysis of bone density
distribution in the proximal femur. However, deploying automated segmentation
models in practice remains difficult because deep networks trained on one
dataset often fail when applied to another. This failure stems from domain
shift, where scanners, reconstruction settings, and patient demographics vary
across institutions, leading to unstable predictions and unreliable
quantitative metrics. Overcoming this barrier is essential for multi-center
osteoporosis research and for ensuring that radiomics and structural finite
element analysis results remain reproducible across sites. In this work, we
developed a domain-adaptive transformer segmentation framework tailored for
multi-institutional QCT. Our model is trained and validated on one of the
largest hip fracture related research cohorts to date, comprising 1,024 QCT
images scans from Tulane University and 384 scans from Rochester, Minnesota for
proximal femur segmentation. To address domain shift, we integrate two
complementary strategies within a 3D TransUNet backbone: adversarial alignment
via Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL), which discourages the network from encoding
site-specific cues, and statistical alignment via Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(MMD), which explicitly reduces distributional mismatches between institutions.
This dual mechanism balances invariance and fine-grained alignment, enabling
scanner-agnostic feature learning while preserving anatomical detail.

*Moonsoo Jeong,Dongbeen Kim,Minseong Kim,Sungkil Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于方向一致性的自适应密度控制方法DC4GS，通过梯度角度一致性来优化3D高斯泼溅中的基元分割，减少冗余分割并提高重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自适应密度控制仅基于位置梯度大小进行基元分割，忽略了梯度的方向一致性，导致冗余分割和次优的分割位置。

Method: 将梯度方向一致性引入自适应密度控制，通过梯度角度一致性来捕捉局部结构复杂性，并利用方向一致性定义最优分割位置。

Result: 相比现有方法，DC4GS显著减少了基元数量（实验中最多减少30%），同时大幅提高了重建保真度。

Conclusion: 方向一致性驱动的自适应密度控制能更有效地管理3D高斯泼溅中的基元密度，在减少计算资源的同时提升重建质量。

Abstract: We present a Directional Consistency (DC)-driven Adaptive Density Control
(ADC) for 3D Gaussian Splatting (DC4GS). Whereas the conventional ADC bases its
primitive splitting on the magnitudes of positional gradients, we further
incorporate the DC of the gradients into ADC, and realize it through the
angular coherence of the gradients. Our DC better captures local structural
complexities in ADC, avoiding redundant splitting. When splitting is required,
we again utilize the DC to define optimal split positions so that
sub-primitives best align with the local structures than the conventional
random placement. As a consequence, our DC4GS greatly reduces the number of
primitives (up to 30% in our experiments) than the existing ADC, and also
enhances reconstruction fidelity greatly.

TL;DR: 提出了一种尺度自适应课程学习（SACL）方法，通过动态调整课程设计来改善数据稀缺情况下的肺结节检测模型训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习肺结节检测方法在临床数据稀缺环境下表现不佳，传统静态课程学习策略在数据有限场景中失效。

Method: SACL包含三个关键机制：自适应epoch调度、困难样本注入和尺度感知优化，基于YOLOv11检测器在LUNA25数据集上实现。

Result: 在完整数据集上mAP50与静态课程学习相当，但在数据受限条件下显著优于基线：10%、20%和50%训练数据时分别提升4.6%、3.5%和2.0%。

Conclusion: SACL能够在不同数据规模下实现鲁棒训练，无需架构修改，为医疗机构的肺结节检测系统开发提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Lung nodule detection in chest CT is crucial for early lung cancer diagnosis,
yet existing deep learning approaches face challenges when deployed in clinical
settings with limited annotated data. While curriculum learning has shown
promise in improving model training, traditional static curriculum strategies
fail in data-scarce scenarios. We propose Scale Adaptive Curriculum Learning
(SACL), a novel training strategy that dynamically adjusts curriculum design
based on available data scale. SACL introduces three key mechanisms:(1)
adaptive epoch scheduling, (2) hard sample injection, and (3) scale-aware
optimization. We evaluate SACL on the LUNA25 dataset using YOLOv11 as the base
detector. Experimental results demonstrate that while SACL achieves comparable
performance to static curriculum learning on the full dataset in mAP50, it
shows significant advantages under data-limited conditions with 4.6%, 3.5%, and
2.0% improvements over baseline at 10%, 20%, and 50% of training data
respectively. By enabling robust training across varying data scales without
architectural modifications, SACL provides a practical solution for healthcare
institutions to develop effective lung nodule detection systems despite limited
annotation resources.

Conclusion: 该统一自适应框架在多种脑病理学中实现了最先进的性能，为自动化分割提供了稳健且临床可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated segmentation of heterogeneous brain lesions from multi-modal MRI
remains a critical challenge in clinical neuroimaging. Current deep learning
models are typically specialized `point solutions' that lack generalization and
high performance variance, limiting their clinical reliability. To address
these gaps, we propose the Unified Multi-Stream SYNAPSE-Net, an adaptive
framework designed for both generalization and robustness. The framework is
built on a novel hybrid architecture integrating multi-stream CNN encoders, a
Swin Transformer bottleneck for global context, a dynamic cross-modal attention
fusion (CMAF) mechanism, and a hierarchical gated decoder for high-fidelity
mask reconstruction. The architecture is trained with a variance reduction
strategy that combines pathology specific data augmentation and
difficulty-aware sampling method. The model was evaluated on three different
challenging public datasets: the MICCAI 2017 WMH Challenge, the ISLES 2022
Challenge, and the BraTS 2020 Challenge. Our framework attained a
state-of-the-art DSC value of 0.831 with the HD95 value of 3.03 in the WMH
dataset. For ISLES 2022, it achieved the best boundary accuracy with a
statistically significant difference (HD95 value of 9.69). For BraTS 2020, it
reached the highest DSC value for the tumor core region (0.8651). These
experimental findings suggest that our unified adaptive framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple brain pathologies, providing a
robust and clinically feasible solution for automated segmentation. The source
code and the pre-trained models are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语义帧聚合的Transformer模型（SFAT），用于直播视频评论生成，通过加权聚合相关视频帧并关注聊天上下文，生成更符合语境的评论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了优先处理与观众互动最相关的视频帧，这对生成上下文适当的评论至关重要。直播视频包含大量数据和无关内容，需要更好的帧优先级处理机制。

Method: SFAT模型利用CLIP的视觉-文本多模态知识，根据语义相关性为视频帧分配权重，采用加权帧求和技术强调信息丰富的帧，并使用交叉注意力机制的解码器融合聊天和视频的上下文线索。

Result: 构建了大规模多模态英文视频评论数据集，涵盖11个视频类别、438小时时长和320万条评论。与现有方法相比，SFAT模型在生成直播视频评论方面表现出更好的效果。

Conclusion: SFAT模型通过语义帧聚合和跨模态注意力机制，能够有效生成与直播视频内容和观众聊天上下文相符的评论，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Live commenting on video streams has surged in popularity on platforms like
Twitch, enhancing viewer engagement through dynamic interactions. However,
automatically generating contextually appropriate comments remains a
challenging and exciting task. Video streams can contain a vast amount of data
and extraneous content. Existing approaches tend to overlook an important
aspect of prioritizing video frames that are most relevant to ongoing viewer
interactions. This prioritization is crucial for producing contextually
appropriate comments. To address this gap, we introduce a novel Semantic Frame
Aggregation-based Transformer (SFAT) model for live video comment generation.
This method not only leverages CLIP's visual-text multimodal knowledge to
generate comments but also assigns weights to video frames based on their
semantic relevance to ongoing viewer conversation. It employs an efficient
weighted sum of frames technique to emphasize informative frames while focusing
less on irrelevant ones. Finally, our comment decoder with a cross-attention
mechanism that attends to each modality ensures that the generated comment
reflects contextual cues from both chats and video. Furthermore, to address the
limitations of existing datasets, which predominantly focus on Chinese-language
content with limited video categories, we have constructed a large scale,
diverse, multimodal English video comments dataset. Extracted from Twitch, this
dataset covers 11 video categories, totaling 438 hours and 3.2 million
comments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our SFAT model by comparing it to
existing methods for generating comments from live video and ongoing dialogue
contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开放世界中，人类-物体交互不断演变，传统封闭世界模型难以适应。受人类渐进学习能力启发，探索增量HOI检测以应对动态环境中的挑战。

Method: 提出增量关系蒸馏框架，将对象和关系学习解耦，引入两种独特的蒸馏损失来学习跨不同HOI组合的恒定关系特征。

Result: 在HICO-DET和V-COCO数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在缓解遗忘、增强对交互漂移的鲁棒性以及零样本HOI泛化方面优于最先进基线。

Conclusion: 所提出的IRD框架在动态环境中有效解决了增量HOI检测的关键挑战，实现了持续学习能力。

Abstract: In open-world environments, human-object interactions (HOIs) evolve
continuously, challenging conventional closed-world HOI detection models.
Inspired by humans' ability to progressively acquire knowledge, we explore
incremental HOI detection (IHOID) to develop agents capable of discerning
human-object relations in such dynamic environments. This setup confronts not
only the common issue of catastrophic forgetting in incremental learning but
also distinct challenges posed by interaction drift and detecting zero-shot HOI
combinations with sequentially arriving data. Therefore, we propose a novel
exemplar-free incremental relation distillation (IRD) framework. IRD decouples
the learning of objects and relations, and introduces two unique distillation
losses for learning invariant relation features across different HOI
combinations that share the same relation. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET
and V-COCO datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over
state-of-the-art baselines in mitigating forgetting, strengthening robustness
against interaction drift, and generalization on zero-shot HOIs. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AD-SAM是一个针对自动驾驶场景优化的语义分割基础模型，通过双编码器和可变形解码器架构，在Cityscapes和BDD100K数据集上显著超越了SAM、G-SAM和DeepLabV3等基准模型。


<details>

Motivation: 针对自动驾驶场景的空间和几何复杂性，需要专门优化的语义分割模型来提升分割精度和泛化能力。

Method: 采用双编码器架构结合SAM的ViT-H全局语义和ResNet-50局部空间细节，使用可变形融合模块对齐异构特征，并通过可变形注意力进行多阶段精炼。

Result: 在Cityscapes上达到68.1 mIoU，BDD100K上达到59.5 mIoU，分别比基准模型提升高达22.9和19.2 mIoU，具有更强的跨域泛化能力和数据效率。

Conclusion: 通过对基础模型进行针对性的架构和优化增强，可以实现可靠且可扩展的自动驾驶感知系统。

Abstract: This paper presents the Autonomous Driving Segment Anything Model (AD-SAM), a
fine-tuned vision foundation model for semantic segmentation in autonomous
driving (AD). AD-SAM extends the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with a
dual-encoder and deformable decoder tailored to spatial and geometric
complexity of road scenes. The dual-encoder produces multi-scale fused
representations by combining global semantic context from SAM's pretrained
Vision Transformer (ViT-H) with local spatial detail from a trainable
convolutional deep learning backbone (i.e., ResNet-50). A deformable fusion
module aligns heterogeneous features across scales and object geometries. The
decoder performs progressive multi-stage refinement using deformable attention.
Training is guided by a hybrid loss that integrates Focal, Dice,
Lovasz-Softmax, and Surface losses, improving semantic class balance, boundary
precision, and optimization stability. Experiments on the Cityscapes and
Berkeley DeepDrive 100K (BDD100K) benchmarks show that AD-SAM surpasses SAM,
Generalized SAM (G-SAM), and a deep learning baseline (DeepLabV3) in
segmentation accuracy. It achieves 68.1 mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on
Cityscapes and 59.5 mIoU on BDD100K, outperforming SAM, G-SAM, and DeepLabV3 by
margins of up to +22.9 and +19.2 mIoU in structured and diverse road scenes,
respectively. AD-SAM demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization with a
0.87 retention score (vs. 0.76 for SAM), and faster, more stable learning
dynamics, converging within 30-40 epochs, enjoying double the learning speed of
benchmark models. It maintains 0.607 mIoU with only 1000 samples, suggesting
data efficiency critical for reducing annotation costs. These results confirm
that targeted architectural and optimization enhancements to foundation models
enable reliable and scalable AD perception.

TL;DR: HiT是一种新颖的分层神经场表示方法，用于3D形状的无监督分层学习，通过分层变压器自动识别跨类别的通用子结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常限制在固定的分层结构（如二叉树），无法灵活适应不同形状类别的复杂层次关系，需要一种能自动从数据中推断分层结构的方法。

Method: 使用分层变压器（HiT），每个层级通过压缩码本学习树层次结构的父子关系，码本自动识别跨类别的通用子结构，不限制具体分层结构类型。

Result: 在55个ShapeNet类别上进行无监督形状分割任务，成功将形状分割为多个粒度级别，捕获了有意义的父子节点包含关系。

Conclusion: HiT能够从数据中自动推断分层结构，比先前方法表示更通用和复杂的层次关系，在跨类别形状分析中表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce HiT, a novel hierarchical neural field representation for 3D
shapes that learns general hierarchies in a coarse-to-fine manner across
different shape categories in an unsupervised setting. Our key contribution is
a hierarchical transformer (HiT), where each level learns parent-child
relationships of the tree hierarchy using a compressed codebook. This codebook
enables the network to automatically identify common substructures across
potentially diverse shape categories. Unlike previous works that constrain the
task to a fixed hierarchical structure (e.g., binary), we impose no such
restriction, except for limiting the total number of nodes at each tree level.
This flexibility allows our method to infer the hierarchical structure directly
from data, over multiple shape categories, and representing more general and
complex hierarchies than prior approaches. When trained at scale with a
reconstruction loss, our model captures meaningful containment relationships
between parent and child nodes. We demonstrate its effectiveness through an
unsupervised shape segmentation task over all 55 ShapeNet categories, where our
method successfully segments shapes into multiple levels of granularity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前fMRI到图像重建方法主要依赖主题特定模型或需要主题特定微调，限制了可扩展性和实际应用。

Result: ZEBRA在多个指标上显著优于零样本基线，并达到与完全微调模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了向通用神经解码的可扩展和实用步骤。

Abstract: Recent advances in neural decoding have enabled the reconstruction of visual
experiences from brain activity, positioning fMRI-to-image reconstruction as a
promising bridge between neuroscience and computer vision. However, current
methods predominantly rely on subject-specific models or require
subject-specific fine-tuning, limiting their scalability and real-world
applicability. In this work, we introduce ZEBRA, the first zero-shot brain
visual decoding framework that eliminates the need for subject-specific
adaptation. ZEBRA is built on the key insight that fMRI representations can be
decomposed into subject-related and semantic-related components. By leveraging
adversarial training, our method explicitly disentangles these components to
isolate subject-invariant, semantic-specific representations. This
disentanglement allows ZEBRA to generalize to unseen subjects without any
additional fMRI data or retraining. Extensive experiments show that ZEBRA
significantly outperforms zero-shot baselines and achieves performance
comparable to fully finetuned models on several metrics. Our work represents a
scalable and practical step toward universal neural decoding. Code and model
weights are available at: https://github.com/xmed-lab/ZEBRA.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and its subsequent variants have led to
remarkable progress in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). While most
recent 3DGS-based SLAM works focus on small-scale indoor scenes, developing
3DGS-based SLAM methods for large-scale forest scenes holds great potential for
many real-world applications, especially for wildfire emergency response and
forest management. However, this line of research is impeded by the absence of
a comprehensive and high-quality dataset, and collecting such a dataset over
real-world scenes is costly and technically infeasible. To this end, we have
built a large-scale, comprehensive, and high-quality synthetic dataset for SLAM
in wildfire and forest environments. Leveraging the Unreal Engine 5 Electric
Dreams Environment Sample Project, we developed a pipeline to easily collect
aerial and ground views, including ground-truth camera poses and a range of
additional data modalities from unmanned aerial vehicle. Our pipeline also
provides flexible controls on environmental factors such as light, weather, and
types and conditions of wildfire, supporting the need for various tasks
covering forest mapping, wildfire emergency response, and beyond. The resulting
pilot dataset, WildfireX-SLAM, contains 5.5k low-altitude RGB-D aerial images
from a large-scale forest map with a total size of 16 km2. On top of
WildfireX-SLAM, a thorough benchmark is also conducted, which not only reveals
the unique challenges of 3DGS-based SLAM in the forest but also highlights
potential improvements for future works. The dataset and code will be publicly
available. Project page: https://zhicongsun.github.io/wildfirexslam.

*Tong Shen,Jingai Yu,Dong Zhou,Dong Li,Emad Barsoum*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出E-MMDiT，一个仅304M参数的高效轻量多模态扩散模型，通过token压缩、位置强化和交替子区域注意力等技术，在低训练资源下实现快速图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型需要大规模训练数据和大量计算资源，或者结构复杂延迟高，需要开发更高效的模型来降低训练成本。

Method: 采用高度压缩的视觉tokenizer，提出多路径压缩模块减少token数量，引入位置强化保持空间一致性，使用交替子区域注意力降低计算成本，以及AdaLN-affine轻量调制模块。

Result: 在单节点8个AMD MI300X GPU上仅用1.5天训练25M公开数据，512px生成在GenEval上达到0.66，通过GRPO后处理可达0.72。

Conclusion: E-MMDiT为未来研究提供了强大实用的基线，有助于生成式AI模型的民主化。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong capabilities in generating high-quality
images from text prompts. However, these models often require large-scale
training data and significant computational resources to train, or suffer from
heavy structure with high latency. To this end, we propose Efficient Multimodal
Diffusion Transformer (E-MMDiT), an efficient and lightweight multimodal
diffusion model with only 304M parameters for fast image synthesis requiring
low training resources. We provide an easily reproducible baseline with
competitive results. Our model for 512px generation, trained with only 25M
public data in 1.5 days on a single node of 8 AMD MI300X GPUs, achieves 0.66 on
GenEval and easily reaches to 0.72 with some post-training techniques such as
GRPO. Our design philosophy centers on token reduction as the computational
cost scales significantly with the token count. We adopt a highly compressive
visual tokenizer to produce a more compact representation and propose a novel
multi-path compression module for further compression of tokens. To enhance our
design, we introduce Position Reinforcement, which strengthens positional
information to maintain spatial coherence, and Alternating Subregion Attention
(ASA), which performs attention within subregions to further reduce
computational cost. In addition, we propose AdaLN-affine, an efficient
lightweight module for computing modulation parameters in transformer blocks.
Our code is available at https://github.com/AMD-AGI/Nitro-E and we hope E-MMDiT
serves as a strong and practical baseline for future research and contributes
to democratization of generative AI models.

TL;DR: 提出CVCAM和MHSAM模块，通过跨视图交互和多尺度空间注意力提升跨视角物体地理定位性能，并创建G2D数据集填补地面到无人机定位任务空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法有效在视图间传递信息，且未进一步优化空间关系特征图，导致模型错误关注边缘噪声，影响定位性能。

Method: 引入跨视图跨注意力模块(CVCAM)进行多轮视图间交互，集成多头空间注意力模块(MHSAM)提取多尺度空间特征，并创建G2D数据集。

Result: 在CVOGL和G2D数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法实现了高定位精度，超越了当前最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过改进视图间信息传递和特征表示，有效提升了跨视角物体地理定位的性能。

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization has recently gained attention due to
potential applications. Existing methods aim to capture spatial dependencies of
query objects between different views through attention mechanisms to obtain
spatial relationship feature maps, which are then used to predict object
locations. Although promising, these approaches fail to effectively transfer
information between views and do not further refine the spatial relationship
feature maps. This results in the model erroneously focusing on irrelevant edge
noise, thereby affecting localization performance. To address these
limitations, we introduce a Cross-view and Cross-attention Module (CVCAM),
which performs multiple iterations of interaction between the two views,
enabling continuous exchange and learning of contextual information about the
query object from both perspectives. This facilitates a deeper understanding of
cross-view relationships while suppressing the edge noise unrelated to the
query object. Furthermore, we integrate a Multi-head Spatial Attention Module
(MHSAM), which employs convolutional kernels of various sizes to extract
multi-scale spatial features from the feature maps containing implicit
correspondences, further enhancing the feature representation of the query
object. Additionally, given the scarcity of datasets for cross-view object
geo-localization, we created a new dataset called G2D for the "Ground-to-Drone"
localization task, enriching existing datasets and filling the gap in
"Ground-to-Drone" localization task. Extensive experiments on the CVOGL and G2D
datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves high localization
accuracy, surpassing the current state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: HiGS是一个分层生成框架，通过多步关联语义空间组合实现3D场景生成，让用户能够迭代扩展场景，提供细粒度控制，同时模型自动完成周边区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法大多采用单步生成过程，难以在场景复杂度和最小用户输入之间取得平衡。受人类从全局到局部、聚焦关键元素并通过语义关联完成场景的认知过程启发。

Method: 提出HiGS分层生成框架，引入渐进层次空间语义图(PHiSSG)动态组织空间关系和语义依赖，保持图节点与生成对象的一对一映射，支持递归布局优化。

Result: 实验表明HiGS在布局合理性、风格一致性和用户偏好方面优于单阶段方法。

Conclusion: HiGS为高效3D场景构建提供了可控且可扩展的范式。

Abstract: Three-dimensional scene generation holds significant potential in gaming,
film, and virtual reality. However, most existing methods adopt a single-step
generation process, making it difficult to balance scene complexity with
minimal user input. Inspired by the human cognitive process in scene modeling,
which progresses from global to local, focuses on key elements, and completes
the scene through semantic association, we propose HiGS, a hierarchical
generative framework for multi-step associative semantic spatial composition.
HiGS enables users to iteratively expand scenes by selecting key semantic
objects, offering fine-grained control over regions of interest while the model
completes peripheral areas automatically. To support structured and coherent
generation, we introduce the Progressive Hierarchical Spatial-Semantic Graph
(PHiSSG), which dynamically organizes spatial relationships and semantic
dependencies across the evolving scene structure. PHiSSG ensures spatial and
geometric consistency throughout the generation process by maintaining a
one-to-one mapping between graph nodes and generated objects and supporting
recursive layout optimization. Experiments demonstrate that HiGS outperforms
single-stage methods in layout plausibility, style consistency, and user
preference, offering a controllable and extensible paradigm for efficient 3D
scene construction.

Conclusion: AFM-Net通过创新的分层融合机制和混合专家分类器，有效解决了遥感图像场景分类中的多尺度特征建模问题，在保持高效计算的同时实现了优异的分类性能。

Abstract: Remote sensing image scene classification remains a challenging task,
primarily due to the complex spatial structures and multi-scale characteristics
of ground objects. Existing approaches see CNNs excel at modeling local
textures, while Transformers excel at capturing global context. However,
efficiently integrating them remains a bottleneck due to the high computational
cost of Transformers. To tackle this, we propose AFM-Net, a novel Advanced
Hierarchical Fusing framework that achieves effective local and global
co-representation through two pathways: a CNN branch for extracting
hierarchical visual priors, and a Mamba branch for efficient global sequence
modeling. The core innovation of AFM-Net lies in its Hierarchical Fusion
Mechanism, which progressively aggregates multi-scale features from both
pathways, enabling dynamic cross-level feature interaction and contextual
reconstruction to produce highly discriminative representations. These fused
features are then adaptively routed through a Mixture-of-Experts classifier
module, which dispatches them to the most suitable experts for fine-grained
scene recognition. Experiments on AID, NWPU-RESISC45, and UC Merced show that
AFM-Net obtains 93.72, 95.54, and 96.92 percent accuracy, surpassing
state-of-the-art methods with balanced performance and efficiency. Code is

Motivation: Banff分类作为肾移植活检评估的全球标准，其半定量性质、复杂标准和观察者间变异性给计算复制带来了重大挑战

Method: 将每个Banff指标分解为结构和炎症成分，使用现有分割和检测工具评估其计算可行性，通过启发式规则将模型输出映射到Banff评分

Result: 研究发现了部分成功和关键失败模式，包括结构遗漏、幻觉和检测模糊性，即使最终评分与专家标注匹配，中间表示的不一致性也常损害可解释性

Conclusion: 当前AI流程在复制计算专家级评分方面存在局限性，强调模块化评估和计算Banff评分标准在指导移植病理学未来模型开发中的重要性

Abstract: The Banff Classification provides the global standard for evaluating renal
transplant biopsies, yet its semi-quantitative nature, complex criteria, and
inter-observer variability present significant challenges for computational
replication. In this study, we explore the feasibility of approximating Banff
lesion scores using existing deep learning models through a modular, rule-based
framework. We decompose each Banff indicator - such as glomerulitis (g),
peritubular capillaritis (ptc), and intimal arteritis (v) - into its
constituent structural and inflammatory components, and assess whether current
segmentation and detection tools can support their computation. Model outputs
are mapped to Banff scores using heuristic rules aligned with expert
guidelines, and evaluated against expert-annotated ground truths. Our findings
highlight both partial successes and critical failure modes, including
structural omission, hallucination, and detection ambiguity. Even when final
scores match expert annotations, inconsistencies in intermediate
representations often undermine interpretability. These results reveal the
limitations of current AI pipelines in replicating computational expert-level
grading, and emphasize the importance of modular evaluation and computational
Banff grading standard in guiding future model development for transplant
pathology.

TL;DR: 提出了一种集成视觉语言模型、大语言模型和物体检测系统的新流程，用于改善高分辨率图像的描述质量，通过多阶段处理增加细节并减少幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型通常基于低分辨率图像预训练，在处理高分辨率图像时会丢失视觉细节和遗漏重要物体，导致描述不准确。

Method: 采用多阶段流程：先用VLM生成初始描述，LLM识别关键物体并预测可能共现的物体，物体检测系统验证预测，对未提及的新检测物体进行区域特定描述。

Result: 在精选的高分辨率图像数据集上实验表明，该流程能生成更详细可靠的图像描述，同时有效减少幻觉。

Conclusion: 提出的集成方法显著提升了高分辨率图像的描述质量，通过结合多种模型优势实现了细节增强和幻觉减少。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle to generate accurate and
detailed captions for high-resolution images since they are typically
pre-trained on low-resolution inputs (e.g., 224x224 or 336x336 pixels).
Downscaling high-resolution images to these dimensions may result in the loss
of visual details and the omission of important objects. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates vision-language models,
large language models (LLMs), and object detection systems to enhance caption
quality. Our proposed pipeline refines captions through a novel, multi-stage
process. Given a high-resolution image, an initial caption is first generated
using a VLM, and key objects in the image are then identified by an LLM. The
LLM predicts additional objects likely to co-occur with the identified key
objects, and these predictions are verified by object detection systems. Newly
detected objects not mentioned in the initial caption undergo focused,
region-specific captioning to ensure they are incorporated. This process
enriches caption detail while reducing hallucinations by removing references to
undetected objects. We evaluate the enhanced captions using pairwise comparison
and quantitative scoring from large multimodal models, along with a benchmark
for hallucination detection. Experiments on a curated dataset of
high-resolution images demonstrate that our pipeline produces more detailed and
reliable image captions while effectively minimizing hallucinations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M^3Detection是一个统一的多帧3D目标检测框架，通过相机和4D成像雷达的多模态数据融合，在VoD和TJ4DRadSet数据集上实现了最先进的3D检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的相机-雷达融合方法大多局限于单帧输入，只能捕获场景的部分信息。不完整的场景信息加上图像质量下降和4D雷达稀疏性，限制了整体检测性能。多帧融合虽然能提供更丰富的时空信息，但面临跨帧跨模态特征融合和计算成本高的挑战。

Conclusion: 该框架通过多级特征融合和多帧时空推理，有效解决了多模态多帧检测中的特征融合和计算效率问题，为恶劣天气下的鲁棒感知提供了成本效益高的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D imaging radar have enabled robust perception in adverse
weather, while camera sensors provide dense semantic information. Fusing the
these complementary modalities has great potential for cost-effective 3D
perception. However, most existing camera-radar fusion methods are limited to
single-frame inputs, capturing only a partial view of the scene. The incomplete
scene information, compounded by image degradation and 4D radar sparsity,
hinders overall detection performance. In contrast, multi-frame fusion offers
richer spatiotemporal information but faces two challenges: achieving robust
and effective object feature fusion across frames and modalities, and
mitigating the computational cost of redundant feature extraction.
Consequently, we propose M^3Detection, a unified multi-frame 3D object
detection framework that performs multi-level feature fusion on multi-modal
data from camera and 4D imaging radar. Our framework leverages intermediate
features from the baseline detector and employs the tracker to produce
reference trajectories, improving computational efficiency and providing richer
information for second-stage. In the second stage, we design a global-level
inter-object feature aggregation module guided by radar information to align
global features across candidate proposals and a local-level inter-grid feature
aggregation module that expands local features along the reference trajectories
to enhance fine-grained object representation. The aggregated features are then
processed by a trajectory-level multi-frame spatiotemporal reasoning module to
encode cross-frame interactions and enhance temporal representation. Extensive
experiments on the VoD and TJ4DRadSet datasets demonstrate that M^3Detection
achieves state-of-the-art 3D detection performance, validating its
effectiveness in multi-frame detection with camera-4D imaging radar fusion.

Conclusion: DANCER框架通过条件增强和渲染模块有效提升了舞蹈视频生成的质量和连续性，为人体动作生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, diffusion models have shown their impressive ability in visual
generation tasks. Besides static images, more and more research attentions have
been drawn to the generation of realistic videos. The video generation not only
has a higher requirement for the quality, but also brings a challenge in
ensuring the video continuity. Among all the video generation tasks,
human-involved contents, such as human dancing, are even more difficult to
generate due to the high degrees of freedom associated with human motions. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework, named as DANCER (Dance ANimation via
Condition Enhancement and Rendering with Diffusion Model), for realistic
single-person dance synthesis based on the most recent stable video diffusion
model. As the video generation is generally guided by a reference image and a
video sequence, we introduce two important modules into our framework to fully
benefit from the two inputs. More specifically, we design an Appearance
Enhancement Module (AEM) to focus more on the details of the reference image
during the generation, and extend the motion guidance through a Pose Rendering
Module (PRM) to capture pose conditions from extra domains. To further improve
the generation capability of our model, we also collect a large amount of video
data from Internet, and generate a novel datasetTikTok-3K to enhance the model
training. The effectiveness of the proposed model has been evaluated through
extensive experiments on real-world datasets, where the performance of our
model is superior to that of the state-of-the-art methods. All the data and
codes will be released upon acceptance.

Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成中表现出色，但其迭代去噪过程计算成本高昂。现有缓存技术在加速推理时面临速度与保真度之间的困难权衡，存在质量下降和高计算开销问题。

Method: 基于去噪过程可功能分离为结构定义阶段和细节优化阶段的洞察，采用双阈值系统选择性缓存每个阶段，并引入池化特征摘要(PFS)技术进行轻量级相似性估计。

Result: 在Flux架构上的实验表明，H2-Cache实现了显著加速(最高5.08倍)，同时保持与基线几乎相同的图像质量，在定量和定性上都优于现有缓存方法。

Conclusion: H2-Cache提供了一个稳健实用的解决方案，有效解决了速度-质量困境，显著降低了高保真扩散模型在实际应用中的门槛。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as state-of-the-art in image generation, but
their practical deployment is hindered by the significant computational cost of
their iterative denoising process. While existing caching techniques can
accelerate inference, they often create a challenging trade-off between speed
and fidelity, suffering from quality degradation and high computational
overhead. To address these limitations, we introduce H2-Cache, a novel
hierarchical caching mechanism designed for modern generative diffusion model
architectures. Our method is founded on the key insight that the denoising
process can be functionally separated into a structure-defining stage and a
detail-refining stage. H2-cache leverages this by employing a dual-threshold
system, using independent thresholds to selectively cache each stage. To ensure
the efficiency of our dual-check approach, we introduce pooled feature
summarization (PFS), a lightweight technique for robust and fast similarity
estimation. Extensive experiments on the Flux architecture demonstrate that
H2-cache achieves significant acceleration (up to 5.08x) while maintaining
image quality nearly identical to the baseline, quantitatively and
qualitatively outperforming existing caching methods. Our work presents a
robust and practical solution that effectively resolves the speed-quality
dilemma, significantly lowering the barrier for the real-world application of
high-fidelity diffusion models. Source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频识别攻击严重威胁用户隐私，可能泄露用户的兴趣爱好、宗教信仰、政治倾向、性取向和健康状况等敏感信息。现有的视频推断技术主要依赖分析在线视频流产生的网络流量。

Method: 通过观察字幕内容决定屏幕上显示的字幕轮廓，识别每个字幕轮廓并推导连续字幕之间的时间差，将空间和时间域信息结合成字幕轮廓的时空特征，探索视频记录的字幕轮廓与其字幕文件之间的时空相关性。

Result: 在现成智能手机上的综合实验证实了SilhouetteTell在各种设置下推断视频标题和片段的高效性，包括在40米距离内。

Conclusion: SilhouetteTell能够推断在线和离线视频，对用户隐私构成严重威胁，需要开发有效的防御措施。

Abstract: Video identification attacks pose a significant privacy threat that can
reveal videos that victims watch, which may disclose their hobbies, religious
beliefs, political leanings, sexual orientation, and health status. Also, video
watching history can be used for user profiling or advertising and may result
in cyberbullying, discrimination, or blackmail. Existing extensive video
inference techniques usually depend on analyzing network traffic generated by
streaming online videos. In this work, we observe that the content of a
subtitle determines its silhouette displayed on the screen, and identifying
each subtitle silhouette also derives the temporal difference between two
consecutive subtitles. We then propose SilhouetteTell, a novel video
identification attack that combines the spatial and time domain information
into a spatiotemporal feature of subtitle silhouettes. SilhouetteTell explores
the spatiotemporal correlation between recorded subtitle silhouettes of a video
and its subtitle file. It can infer both online and offline videos.
Comprehensive experiments on off-the-shelf smartphones confirm the high
efficacy of SilhouetteTell for inferring video titles and clips under various
settings, including from a distance of up to 40 meters.

Result: 在University-1652和SUES-200基准测试上的实验证明了DPHR的有效性和鲁棒性，相比最先进方法实现了持续改进。

Conclusion: 提出的双层次渐进式难度感知重加权策略能够有效解决跨视角地理定位中的困难负样本问题，提高模型性能。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) between drone and satellite imagery
remains challenging due to severe viewpoint gaps and the presence of hard
negatives, which are visually similar but geographically mismatched samples.
Existing mining or reweighting strategies often use static weighting, which is
sensitive to distribution shifts and prone to overemphasizing difficult samples
too early, leading to noisy gradients and unstable convergence. In this paper,
we present a Dual-level Progressive Hardness-aware Reweighting (DPHR) strategy.
At the sample level, a Ratio-based Difficulty-Aware (RDA) module evaluates
relative difficulty and assigns fine-grained weights to negatives. At the batch
level, a Progressive Adaptive Loss Weighting (PALW) mechanism exploits a
training-progress signal to attenuate noisy gradients during early optimization
and progressively enhance hard-negative mining as training matures. Experiments
on the University-1652 and SUES-200 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness
and robustness of the proposed DPHR, achieving consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 稀疏模型反演策略有效解决了密集反演方法的效率问题，在保持性能的同时大幅提升反演速度。

Abstract: Model inversion, which aims to reconstruct the original training data from
pre-trained discriminative models, is especially useful when the original
training data is unavailable due to privacy, usage rights, or size constraints.
However, existing dense inversion methods attempt to reconstruct the entire
image area, making them extremely inefficient when inverting high-resolution
images from large-scale Vision Transformers (ViTs). We further identify two
underlying causes of this inefficiency: the redundant inversion of noisy
backgrounds and the unintended inversion of spurious correlations--a phenomenon
we term "hallucination" in model inversion. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel sparse model inversion strategy, as a plug-and-play extension
to speed up existing dense inversion methods with no need for modifying their
original loss functions. Specifically, we selectively invert semantic
foregrounds while stopping the inversion of noisy backgrounds and potential
spurious correlations. Through both theoretical and empirical studies, we
validate the efficacy of our approach in achieving significant inversion
acceleration (up to 3.79 faster) while maintaining comparable or even enhanced
downstream performance in data-free model quantization and data-free knowledge
transfer. Code is available at https://github.com/Egg-Hu/SMI.

Method: 引入新的多模态交互真实性评估(MIVA)任务，构建基于狼人杀游戏的多模态数据集，包含同步视频、文本和可验证的真实标签，并建立基准评估最先进的多模态大语言模型。

Result: 评估显示存在显著的性能差距：即使是像GPT-4o这样的强大模型也难以可靠地区分真假。失败模式分析表明这些模型无法有效将语言与视觉社交线索相结合，且可能因对齐过于保守而表现不佳。

Conclusion: 迫切需要开发新方法来构建更具洞察力和可信度的AI系统，当前的多模态大语言模型在欺骗检测这一关键领域的能力仍有待提升。

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly integrated into human lives, endowing them
with robust social intelligence has emerged as a critical frontier. A key
aspect of this intelligence is discerning truth from deception, a ubiquitous
element of human interaction that is conveyed through a complex interplay of
verbal language and non-verbal visual cues. However, automatic deception
detection in dynamic, multi-party conversations remains a significant
challenge. The recent rise of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), with their impressive abilities in visual and textual understanding,
makes them natural candidates for this task. Consequently, their capabilities
in this crucial domain are mostly unquantified. To address this gap, we
introduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Veracity Assessment (MIVA), and
present a novel multimodal dataset derived from the social deduction game
Werewolf. This dataset provides synchronized video, text, with verifiable
ground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark
evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap:
even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood
reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to
ground language in visual social cues effectively and may be overly
conservative in their alignment, highlighting the urgent need for novel
approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合多源数据的层次图神经网络模型，用于深入分析村庄空间形态，在融合多模态特征和分类任务上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着城市化发展，村庄空间特征逐渐消失和景观同质化问题突出。现有研究多采用单一学科视角，依赖定性分析方法，受限于数字基础设施不足和数据匮乏。

Method: 提出层次图神经网络模型，包含输入节点和通信节点两种节点类型，静态输入边和动态通信边两种边类型。结合图卷积网络和图注意力网络，在双阶段特征更新机制下高效整合多模态特征。引入关系池化机制，在17个子类型上实施联合训练策略。

Conclusion: 该方法为探索村庄空间模式和生成逻辑提供了科学依据。

Abstract: Villages areas hold significant importance in the study of human-land
relationships. However, with the advancement of urbanization, the gradual
disappearance of spatial characteristics and the homogenization of landscapes
have emerged as prominent issues. Existing studies primarily adopt a
single-disciplinary perspective to analyze villages spatial morphology and its
influencing factors, relying heavily on qualitative analysis methods. These
efforts are often constrained by the lack of digital infrastructure and
insufficient data. To address the current research limitations, this paper
proposes a Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (HGNN) model that integrates
multi-source data to conduct an in-depth analysis of villages spatial
morphology. The framework includes two types of nodes-input nodes and
communication nodes-and two types of edges-static input edges and dynamic
communication edges. By combining Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph
Attention Networks (GAT), the proposed model efficiently integrates multimodal
features under a two-stage feature update mechanism. Additionally, based on
existing principles for classifying villages spatial morphology, the paper
introduces a relational pooling mechanism and implements a joint training
strategy across 17 subtypes. Experimental results demonstrate that this method
achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches in
multimodal fusion and classification tasks. Additionally, the proposed joint
optimization of all sub-types lifts mean accuracy/F1 from 0.71/0.83
(independent models) to 0.82/0.90, driven by a 6% gain for parcel tasks. Our
method provides scientific evidence for exploring villages spatial patterns and
generative logic.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的持续自监督学习框架，用于从多窗口胸部CT图像中学习多样化特征，同时确保数据隐私。通过潜在重放机制和特征蒸馏技术，解决了医学图像诊断中的领域偏移和灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像诊断面临大规模标注数据稀缺和动态医疗环境中的领域偏移问题。特别是在胸部CT中，不同窗口设置会导致领域偏移。传统方法需要重用过去数据，但受限于隐私约束。

Method: 采用持续预训练方法，结合潜在重放机制来缓解灾难性遗忘，同时引入基于Wasserstein距离的知识蒸馏和批量知识集成的特征蒸馏技术，学习领域偏移鲁棒的特征表示。

Result: 在两个不同窗口设置的胸部CT图像上验证了该方法，相比其他方法表现出更优越的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效学习多样化特征，缓解领域偏移问题，同时确保数据隐私，为医学图像诊断提供了实用的持续学习解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a novel continual self-supervised learning (CSSL) framework for
simultaneously learning diverse features from multi-window-obtained chest
computed tomography (CT) images and ensuring data privacy. Achieving a robust
and highly generalizable model in medical image diagnosis is challenging,
mainly because of issues, such as the scarcity of large-scale, accurately
annotated datasets and domain shifts inherent to dynamic healthcare
environments. Specifically, in chest CT, these domain shifts often arise from
differences in window settings, which are optimized for distinct clinical
purposes. Previous CSSL frameworks often mitigated domain shift by reusing past
data, a typically impractical approach owing to privacy constraints. Our
approach addresses these challenges by effectively capturing the relationship
between previously learned knowledge and new information across different
training stages through continual pretraining on unlabeled images.
Specifically, by incorporating a latent replay-based mechanism into CSSL, our
method mitigates catastrophic forgetting due to domain shifts during continual
pretraining while ensuring data privacy. Additionally, we introduce a feature
distillation technique that integrates Wasserstein distance-based knowledge
distillation (WKD) and batch-knowledge ensemble (BKE), enhancing the ability of
the model to learn meaningful, domain-shift-robust representations. Finally, we
validate our approach using chest CT images obtained across two different
window settings, demonstrating superior performance compared with other
approaches.

*Renjie Ji,Xue Wang,Chao Niu,Wen Zhang,Yong Mei,Kun Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SpecAware，一种新颖的高光谱光谱内容感知基础模型，通过超网络驱动的编码过程统一多传感器学习，解决高光谱成像数据异质性和多传感器训练问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱成像(HSI)是精细土地利用和土地覆盖(LULC)制图的重要工具，但HSI数据的固有异质性阻碍了通过联合训练开发通用模型。现有HSI基础模型通常忽略传感器元属性的关键指导作用，难以进行多传感器训练，限制了其可迁移性。

Method: SpecAware采用两步超网络驱动编码过程：1) 元内容感知模块，融合传感器元属性和图像内容为每个HSI样本生成条件输入；2) HyperEmbedding模块，通过样本条件超网络动态生成矩阵因子对进行通道级编码，包括自适应空间模式提取和潜在语义特征重投影。

Result: 在六个数据集上的广泛实验表明，SpecAware能够学习到优越的特征表示，在土地覆盖语义分割分类、变化检测和场景分类方面表现出色。

Conclusion: SpecAware能够感知和解释不同场景和传感器的空间-光谱特征，自适应处理可变数量的光谱通道，为联合预训练建立了统一框架。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a vital tool for fine-grained land-use and
land-cover (LULC) mapping. However, the inherent heterogeneity of HSI data has
long posed a major barrier to developing generalized models via joint training.
Although HSI foundation models have shown promise for different downstream
tasks, the existing approaches typically overlook the critical guiding role of
sensor meta-attributes, and struggle with multi-sensor training, limiting their
transferability. To address these challenges, we propose SpecAware, which is a
novel hyperspectral spectral-content aware foundation model for unifying
multi-sensor learning for HSI mapping. We also constructed the Hyper-400K
dataset to facilitate this research, which is a new large-scale, high-quality
benchmark dataset with over 400k image patches from diverse airborne AVIRIS
sensors. The core of SpecAware is a two-step hypernetwork-driven encoding
process for HSI data. Firstly, we designed a meta-content aware module to
generate a unique conditional input for each HSI patch, tailored to each
spectral band of every sample by fusing the sensor meta-attributes and its own
image content. Secondly, we designed the HyperEmbedding module, where a
sample-conditioned hypernetwork dynamically generates a pair of matrix factors
for channel-wise encoding, consisting of adaptive spatial pattern extraction
and latent semantic feature re-projection. Thus, SpecAware gains the ability to
perceive and interpret spatial-spectral features across diverse scenes and
sensors. This, in turn, allows SpecAware to adaptively process a variable
number of spectral channels, establishing a unified framework for joint
pre-training. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that SpecAware
can learn superior feature representations, excelling in land-cover semantic
segmentation classification, change detection, and scene classification.

Abstract: Accurate building instance segmentation and height classification are
critical for urban planning, 3D city modeling, and infrastructure monitoring.
This paper presents a detailed analysis of YOLOv11, the recent advancement in
the YOLO series of deep learning models, focusing on its application to joint
building extraction and discrete height classification from satellite imagery.
YOLOv11 builds on the strengths of earlier YOLO models by introducing a more
efficient architecture that better combines features at different scales,
improves object localization accuracy, and enhances performance in complex
urban scenes. Using the DFC2023 Track 2 dataset -- which includes over 125,000
annotated buildings across 12 cities -- we evaluate YOLOv11's performance using
metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and mean average precision (mAP).
Our findings demonstrate that YOLOv11 achieves strong instance segmentation
performance with 60.4\% mAP@50 and 38.3\% mAP@50--95 while maintaining robust
classification accuracy across five predefined height tiers. The model excels
in handling occlusions, complex building shapes, and class imbalance,
particularly for rare high-rise structures. Comparative analysis confirms that
YOLOv11 outperforms earlier multitask frameworks in both detection accuracy and
inference speed, making it well-suited for real-time, large-scale urban
mapping. This research highlights YOLOv11's potential to advance semantic urban
reconstruction through streamlined categorical height modeling, offering
actionable insights for future developments in remote sensing and geospatial
intelligence.

Abstract: Recent advances in language and vision have demonstrated that scaling up
model capacity consistently improves performance across diverse tasks. In 3D
visual geometry reconstruction, large-scale training has likewise proven
effective for learning versatile representations. However, further scaling of
3D models is challenging due to the complexity of geometric supervision and the
diversity of 3D data. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoRE, a dense
3D visual foundation model based on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
that dynamically routes features to task-specific experts, allowing them to
specialize in complementary data aspects and enhance both scalability and
adaptability. Aiming to improve robustness under real-world conditions, MoRE
incorporates a confidence-based depth refinement module that stabilizes and
refines geometric estimation. In addition, it integrates dense semantic
features with globally aligned 3D backbone representations for high-fidelity
surface normal prediction. MoRE is further optimized with tailored loss
functions to ensure robust learning across diverse inputs and multiple
geometric tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoRE achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks and supports effective
downstream applications without extra computation.

Conclusion: Object-IR通过自监督学习有效解决了图像重定向中的几何失真问题，无需手动标注数据集，在保持实时性能的同时实现了优越的视觉质量。

Abstract: Eliminating geometric distortion in semantically important regions remains an
intractable challenge in image retargeting. This paper presents Object-IR, a
self-supervised architecture that reformulates image retargeting as a
learning-based mesh warping optimization problem, where the mesh deformation is
guided by object appearance consistency and geometric-preserving constraints.
Given an input image and a target aspect ratio, we initialize a uniform rigid
mesh at the output resolution and use a convolutional neural network to predict
the motion of each mesh grid and obtain the deformed mesh. The retargeted
result is generated by warping the input image according to the rigid mesh in
the input image and the deformed mesh in the output resolution. To mitigate
geometric distortion, we design a comprehensive objective function
incorporating a) object-consistent loss to ensure that the important semantic
objects retain their appearance, b) geometric-preserving loss to constrain
simple scale transform of the important meshes, and c) boundary loss to enforce
a clean rectangular output. Notably, our self-supervised paradigm eliminates
the need for manually annotated retargeting datasets by deriving supervision
directly from the input's geometric and semantic properties. Extensive
evaluations on the RetargetMe benchmark demonstrate that our Object-IR achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods in quantitative
metrics and subjective visual quality assessments. The framework efficiently
processes arbitrary input resolutions (average inference time: 0.009s for
1024x683 resolution) while maintaining real-time performance on consumer-grade
GPUs. The source code will soon be available at

Conclusion: FuseCPath框架能够有效融合异构病理基础模型，提升下游任务的性能，为计算病理学中的模型融合提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Whole slide image (WSI) analysis has emerged as an increasingly essential
technique in computational pathology. Recent advances in the pathological
foundation models (FMs) have demonstrated significant advantages in deriving
meaningful patch-level or slide-level feature representations from WSIs.
However, current pathological FMs have exhibited substantial heterogeneity
caused by diverse private training datasets and different network
architectures. This heterogeneity introduces performance variability when we
utilize the extracted features from different FMs in the downstream tasks. To
fully explore the advantage of multiple FMs effectively, in this work, we
propose a novel framework for the fusion of heterogeneous pathological FMs,
called FuseCPath, yielding a model with a superior ensemble performance. The
main contributions of our framework can be summarized as follows: (i) To
guarantee the representativeness of the training patches, we propose a
multi-view clustering-based method to filter out the discriminative patches via
multiple FMs' embeddings. (ii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous
patch-level FMs, we devise a cluster-level re-embedding strategy to online
capture patch-level local features. (iii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous
slide-level FMs, we devise a collaborative distillation strategy to explore the
connections between slide-level FMs. Extensive experiments conducted on lung
cancer, bladder cancer, and colorectal cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) have demonstrated that the proposed FuseCPath achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks on these public datasets.

Abstract: In recent times, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been successfully adopted
for various applications. Despite their notable achievements, it has become
evident that DNNs are vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial attacks,
restricting their applications in security-critical systems. In this paper, we
present two-phase training methods to tackle the attack: first, training the
denoising network, and second, the deep classifier model. We propose a novel
denoising strategy that integrates both spatial and frequency domain approaches
to defend against adversarial attacks on images. Our analysis reveals that
high-frequency components of attacked images are more severely corrupted
compared to their lower-frequency counterparts. To address this, we leverage
Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for frequency analysis and develop a denoising
network that combines spatial image features with wavelets through a
transformer layer. Next, we retrain the classifier using the denoised images,
which enhances the classifier's robustness against adversarial attacks.
Experimental results across the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Fashion-MNIST datasets
reveal that the proposed method remarkably elevates classification accuracy,
substantially exceeding the performance by utilizing a denoising network and
adversarial training approaches. The code is available at

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in computer
vision tasks such as image classification, segmentation, and object detection.
However, they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can cause incorrect
predictions with small perturbations in input images. Addressing this issue is
crucial for deploying robust deep-learning systems. This paper presents a novel
approach that utilizes contrastive learning for adversarial defense, a
previously unexplored area. Our method leverages the contrastive loss function
to enhance the robustness of classification models by training them with both
clean and adversarially perturbed images. By optimizing the model's parameters
alongside the perturbations, our approach enables the network to learn robust
representations that are less susceptible to adversarial attacks. Experimental
results show significant improvements in the model's robustness against various
types of adversarial perturbations. This suggests that contrastive loss helps
extract more informative and resilient features, contributing to the field of
adversarial robustness in deep learning.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
zero-shot action recognition by learning to associate video embeddings with
class embeddings. However, a significant challenge arises when relying solely
on action classes to provide semantic context, particularly due to the presence
of multi-semantic words, which can introduce ambiguity in understanding the
intended concepts of actions. To address this issue, we propose an innovative
approach that harnesses web-crawled descriptions, leveraging a large-language
model to extract relevant keywords. This method reduces the need for human
annotators and eliminates the laborious manual process of attribute data
creation. Additionally, we introduce a spatio-temporal interaction module
designed to focus on objects and action units, facilitating alignment between
description attributes and video content. In our zero-shot experiments, our
model achieves impressive results, attaining accuracies of 81.0%, 53.1%, and

Conclusion: 通过将相关区域识别任务委托给检索器，RegionRAG使生成器能够专注于与查询相关的简洁视觉内容，提高了效率和准确性。

Abstract: Multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a critical method
for empowering LLMs by leveraging candidate visual documents. However, current
methods consider the entire document as the basic retrieval unit, introducing
substantial irrelevant visual content in two ways: 1) Relevant documents often
contain large regions unrelated to the query, diluting the focus on salient
information; 2) Retrieving multiple documents to increase recall further
introduces redundant and irrelevant documents. These redundant contexts
distract the model's attention and further degrade the performance. To address
this challenge, we propose \modelname, a novel framework that shifts the
retrieval paradigm from the document level to the region level. During
training, we design a hybrid supervision strategy from both labeled data and
unlabeled data to pinpoint relevant patches. During inference, we propose a
dynamic pipeline that intelligently groups salient patches into complete
semantic regions. By delegating the task of identifying relevant regions to the
retriever, \modelname enables the generator to focus solely on concise visual
content relevant to queries, improving both efficiency and accuracy.
Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that RegionRAG achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Improves retrieval accuracy by 10.02\% in R@1 on
average and increases question answering accuracy by 3.56\% while using only
71.42\% visual tokens compared to prior methods. The code will be available at

designed for natural-image benchmarks, are simple and efficient but fail to
deliver consistent gains across diverse medical modalities; their static
interpolation limits reliability in varied clinical tasks. To address this, we
introduce Test-Time Task adaptive merging (T^3), a backpropagation-free
framework that computes per-sample interpolation coefficients via the
Jensen-Shannon divergence between the two models' output distributions. T^3
dynamically preserves local precision when models agree and defers to
generalist robustness under drift. To overcome the inference costs of
sample-wise merging, we further propose a batch-wise extension, T^3_B, that
computes a merging coefficient across a batch of samples, dramatically reducing
computational bottleneck. Recognizing the lack of a standardized
medical-merging benchmark, we present a rigorous cross-evaluation protocol
spanning in-domain, base-to-novel, and corruptions across four modalities.
Empirically, T^3 sets new state-of-the-art in Top-1 accuracy and error
reduction, outperforming strong baselines while maintaining efficiency, paving
the way for adaptive MVLM deployment in clinical settings. Our code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperClick是一个通过不确定性校准增强GUI代理可靠性的框架，使用双重奖励机制优化接地准确性和置信度可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前GUI代理模型缺乏对自身能力边界的认知，导致过度自信和不可靠预测，这在动态GUI自动化任务中尤为关键，因为单个错误就可能导致任务失败

Method: 提出HyperClick框架，引入双重奖励机制：结合正确动作的二元奖励和基于截断高斯分布的空间置信度建模，使用Brier分数进行校准，联合优化接地准确性和置信度可靠性

Result: 在七个挑战基准测试上的广泛实验表明，HyperClick实现了最先进的性能，同时提供了良好校准的置信度

Conclusion: 通过明确的置信度校准和内省式自我批评，HyperClick减少了过度自信，支持更可靠的GUI自动化

Abstract: Autonomous Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents rely on accurate GUI
grounding, which maps language instructions to on-screen coordinates, to
execute user commands. However, current models, whether trained via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), lack self-awareness of
their capability boundaries, leading to overconfidence and unreliable
predictions. We first systematically evaluate probabilistic and verbalized
confidence in general and GUI-specific models, revealing a misalignment between
confidence and actual accuracy, which is particularly critical in dynamic GUI
automation tasks, where single errors can cause task failure. To address this,
we propose HyperClick, a novel framework that enhances reliable GUI grounding
through uncertainty calibration. HyperClick introduces a dual reward mechanism,
combining a binary reward for correct actions with a truncated Gaussian-based
spatial confidence modeling, calibrated using the Brier score. This approach
jointly optimizes grounding accuracy and confidence reliability, fostering
introspective self-criticism. Extensive experiments on seven challenge
benchmarks show that HyperClick achieves state-of-the-art performance while
providing well-calibrated confidence. By enabling explicit confidence
calibration and introspective self-criticism, HyperClick reduces overconfidence
and supports more reliable GUI automation.

*Zirui Zhu,Hailun Xu,Yang Luo,Yong Liu,Kanchan Sarkar,Zhenheng Yang,Yang You*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCUS是一种无需训练、模型无关的关键帧选择方法，通过将关键帧选择建模为多臂老虎机中的组合纯探索问题，在严格token预算下选择查询相关帧，显著提升长视频理解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的关键帧选择方法要么均匀采样，要么依赖预过滤和检索式评分，可能错过最具信息量的时刻，且token预算在从单图像扩展到小时级视频时会急剧膨胀。

Method: 将关键帧选择建模为组合纯探索问题：将短时间片段视为臂，使用经验均值和Bernstein置信半径识别信息丰富区域，采用两阶段探索-利用策略，先识别高价值时间区域，然后在每个区域内选择得分最高的帧。

Result: 在两个长视频问答基准测试中，FOCUS处理少于2%的视频帧即可带来显著的准确率提升。对于超过20分钟的视频，在LongVideoBench上实现了11.9%的准确率增益。

Conclusion: FOCUS作为关键帧选择方法有效，为使用MLLMs进行可扩展的长视频理解提供了简单通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) represent images and video frames as
visual tokens. Scaling from single images to hour-long videos, however,
inflates the token budget far beyond practical limits. Popular pipelines
therefore either uniformly subsample or apply keyframe selection with
retrieval-style scoring using smaller vision-language models. However, these
keyframe selection methods still rely on pre-filtering before selection to
reduce the inference cost and can miss the most informative moments.
  We propose FOCUS, Frame-Optimistic Confidence Upper-bound Selection, a
training-free, model-agnostic keyframe selection module that selects
query-relevant frames under a strict token budget. FOCUS formulates keyframe
selection as a combinatorial pure-exploration (CPE) problem in multi-armed
bandits: it treats short temporal clips as arms, and uses empirical means and
Bernstein confidence radius to identify informative regions while preserving
exploration of uncertain areas. The resulting two-stage
exploration-exploitation procedure reduces from a sequential policy with
theoretical guarantees, first identifying high-value temporal regions, then
selecting top-scoring frames within each region On two long-video
question-answering benchmarks, FOCUS delivers substantial accuracy improvements
while processing less than 2% of video frames. For videos longer than 20
minutes, it achieves an 11.9% gain in accuracy on LongVideoBench, demonstrating
its effectiveness as a keyframe selection method and providing a simple and
general solution for scalable long-video understanding with MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了S-GRACE方法，通过语义引导生成对抗样本来改进扩散模型的概念擦除效果，相比现有方法提升了26%的擦除性能，同时减少90%的训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念擦除方法在扩散模型中使用对抗训练时，忽略了概念语义的重要性，导致对抗样本无法有效拟合目标概念空间，造成擦除不彻底或干扰其他概念的问题。

Method: 提出S-GRACE方法，在概念空间中利用语义引导生成对抗样本，并进行擦除训练，确保对抗样本能全面覆盖目标概念而不干扰其他概念。

Result: 在多种扩散模型遗忘场景下，与7种最先进方法和3种对抗提示生成策略相比，S-GRACE显著提升擦除性能26%，更好地保留非目标概念，训练时间减少90%。

Conclusion: S-GRACE通过语义引导的对抗样本生成，有效解决了现有概念擦除方法在扩散模型中的局限性，实现了更高效和精确的概念擦除。

Abstract: Concept erasure aims to selectively unlearning undesirable content in
diffusion models (DMs) to reduce the risk of sensitive content generation. As a
novel paradigm in concept erasure, most existing methods employ adversarial
training to identify and suppress target concepts, thus reducing the likelihood
of sensitive outputs. However, these methods often neglect the specificity of
adversarial training in DMs, resulting in only partial mitigation. In this
work, we investigate and quantify this specificity from the perspective of
concept space, i.e., can adversarial samples truly fit the target concept
space? We observe that existing methods neglect the role of conceptual
semantics when generating adversarial samples, resulting in ineffective fitting
of concept spaces. This oversight leads to the following issues: 1) when there
are few adversarial samples, they fail to comprehensively cover the object
concept; 2) conversely, they will disrupt other target concept spaces.
Motivated by the analysis of these findings, we introduce S-GRACE
(Semantics-Guided Robust Adversarial Concept Erasure), which grace leveraging
semantic guidance within the concept space to generate adversarial samples and
perform erasure training. Experiments conducted with seven state-of-the-art
methods and three adversarial prompt generation strategies across various DM
unlearning scenarios demonstrate that S-GRACE significantly improves erasure
performance 26%, better preserves non-target concepts, and reduces training
time by 90%. Our code is available at https://github.com/Qhong-522/S-GRACE.

TL;DR: FGMamba是一种轻量级医学图像超分辨率方法，通过门控状态空间模型和金字塔频率融合模块，在保持低计算开销的同时实现全局依赖建模和精细细节增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像超分辨率对于提高诊断准确性和降低采集成本至关重要，但现有方法难以同时建模长距离解剖结构和精细频率细节，且计算开销较大。

Method: 提出FGMamba方法，包含两个关键创新：门控注意力增强状态空间模块(GASM)结合状态空间建模与双分支空间和通道注意力；金字塔频率融合模块(PFFM)通过FFT引导融合捕捉多分辨率高频细节。

Result: 在五种医学成像模态(超声、OCT、MRI、CT和内窥镜)上的广泛评估显示，FGMamba在PSNR/SSIM指标上优于基于CNN和Transformer的最先进方法，同时保持紧凑的参数规模(<0.75M)。

Conclusion: 频率感知状态空间建模为可扩展且准确的医学图像增强提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image super-resolution (SR) is essential for enhancing diagnostic
accuracy while reducing acquisition cost and scanning time. However, modeling
both long-range anatomical structures and fine-grained frequency details with
low computational overhead remains challenging. We propose FGMamba, a novel
frequency-aware gated state-space model that unifies global dependency modeling
and fine-detail enhancement into a lightweight architecture. Our method
introduces two key innovations: a Gated Attention-enhanced State-Space Module
(GASM) that integrates efficient state-space modeling with dual-branch spatial
and channel attention, and a Pyramid Frequency Fusion Module (PFFM) that
captures high-frequency details across multiple resolutions via FFT-guided
fusion. Extensive evaluations across five medical imaging modalities
(Ultrasound, OCT, MRI, CT, and Endoscopic) demonstrate that FGMamba achieves
superior PSNR/SSIM while maintaining a compact parameter footprint ($<$0.75M),
outperforming CNN-based and Transformer-based SOTAs. Our results validate the
effectiveness of frequency-aware state-space modeling for scalable and accurate
medical image enhancement.

Motivation: 早期检测冠状动脉疾病对降低死亡率和改善治疗计划至关重要，但X射线血管造影图像质量差会显著阻碍临床诊断。

Method: 三阶段管道：图像预处理（结合CLAHE和改进的Ben Graham方法）、分割网络（UNet+DenseNet121编码器+Self-ONN解码器）、轮廓精炼模块。

Result: 在5折交叉验证中，IoU达61.43%，DSC达76.10%，clDice达79.36%，优于多个最先进模型。

Conclusion: CASR-Net为自动冠状动脉分割提供了稳健方法，是支持临床医生诊断和治疗规划的有价值工具。

Abstract: Early detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) is critical for reducing
mortality and improving patient treatment planning. While angiographic image
analysis from X-rays is a common and cost-effective method for identifying
cardiac abnormalities, including stenotic coronary arteries, poor image quality
can significantly impede clinical diagnosis. We present the Coronary Artery
Segmentation and Refinement Network (CASR-Net), a three-stage pipeline
comprising image preprocessing, segmentation, and refinement. A novel
multichannel preprocessing strategy combining CLAHE and an improved Ben Graham
method provides incremental gains, increasing Dice Score Coefficient (DSC) by
0.31-0.89% and Intersection over Union (IoU) by 0.40-1.16% compared with using
the techniques individually. The core innovation is a segmentation network
built on a UNet with a DenseNet121 encoder and a Self-organized Operational
Neural Network (Self-ONN) based decoder, which preserves the continuity of
narrow and stenotic vessel branches. A final contour refinement module further
suppresses false positives. Evaluated with 5-fold cross-validation on a
combination of two public datasets that contain both healthy and stenotic
arteries, CASR-Net outperformed several state-of-the-art models, achieving an
IoU of 61.43%, a DSC of 76.10%, and clDice of 79.36%. These results highlight a
robust approach to automated coronary artery segmentation, offering a valuable
tool to support clinicians in diagnosis and treatment planning.

Motivation: 现有基于提示池的方法假设增量任务间的类别集合是互斥的，这不适用于目标检测，因为检测图像中存在固有的类别共现现象。在共现场景中，先前任务的未标记对象可能出现在当前任务图像中，导致提示池混淆。

Method: 提出P²IOD方法，利用神经网络的全局演化特性，将网络作为参数化提示来自适应整合跨任务知识。为了约束提示结构更新，进一步采用参数化提示融合策略。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC2007和MS COCO数据集上的广泛实验表明，P²IOD在增量目标检测中有效，并在现有基线中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 参数化提示结构应具有跨任务的自适应整合特性，通过约束更新来防止灾难性遗忘，P²IOD方法成功解决了增量目标检测中的类别共现问题。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that incorporating trainable prompts into
pretrained models enables effective incremental learning. However, the
application of prompts in incremental object detection (IOD) remains
underexplored. Existing prompts pool based approaches assume disjoint class
sets across incremental tasks, which are unsuitable for IOD as they overlook
the inherent co-occurrence phenomenon in detection images. In co-occurring
scenarios, unlabeled objects from previous tasks may appear in current task
images, leading to confusion in prompts pool. In this paper, we hold that
prompt structures should exhibit adaptive consolidation properties across
tasks, with constrained updates to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Motivated
by this, we introduce Parameterized Prompts for Incremental Object Detection
(P$^2$IOD). Leveraging neural networks global evolution properties, P$^2$IOD
employs networks as the parameterized prompts to adaptively consolidate
knowledge across tasks. To constrain prompts structure updates, P$^2$IOD
further engages a parameterized prompts fusion strategy. Extensive experiments
on PASCAL VOC2007 and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that P$^2$IOD's
effectiveness in IOD and achieves the state-of-the-art performance among
existing baselines.

Motivation: 内窥镜视频中可变形组织的动态重建在机器人辅助手术中至关重要，但现有3D高斯泼溅方法在追求渲染速度时忽略了组织运动引起的锯齿和伪影问题。

Method: 提出SAGS框架，采用注意力驱动的动态加权4D变形解码器，结合3D平滑滤波器和2D Mip滤波器来减轻伪影并更好地捕捉组织运动的细节。

Result: 在EndoNeRF和SCARED两个公开基准测试中，SAGS在PSNR、SSIM和LPIPS所有指标上均优于现有最先进方法，同时提供更好的可视化质量。

Conclusion: SAGS框架有效解决了内窥镜场景中可变形组织重建的伪影问题，在保持高效渲染的同时显著提升了重建质量。

Abstract: Surgical reconstruction of dynamic tissues from endoscopic videos is a
crucial technology in robot-assisted surgery. The development of Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRFs) has greatly advanced deformable tissue reconstruction,
achieving high-quality results from video and image sequences. However,
reconstructing deformable endoscopic scenes remains challenging due to aliasing
and artifacts caused by tissue movement, which can significantly degrade
visualization quality. The introduction of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has
improved reconstruction efficiency by enabling a faster rendering pipeline.
Nevertheless, existing 3DGS methods often prioritize rendering speed while
neglecting these critical issues. To address these challenges, we propose SAGS,
a self-adaptive alias-free Gaussian splatting framework. We introduce an
attention-driven, dynamically weighted 4D deformation decoder, leveraging 3D
smoothing filters and 2D Mip filters to mitigate artifacts in deformable tissue
reconstruction and better capture the fine details of tissue movement.
Experimental results on two public benchmarks, EndoNeRF and SCARED, demonstrate
that our method achieves superior performance in all metrics of PSNR, SSIM, and
LPIPS compared to the state of the art while also delivering better
visualization quality.

Motivation: 解决在深空探测、战场情报等极端低带宽场景下的视觉通信问题，现有文本到图像生成方法只能实现语义级近似，无法满足视觉分析和人机交互的精度要求。

Method: 将图像生成与深度图像压缩无缝集成，使用联合文本和编码潜在向量指导修正流模型进行精确的视觉场景生成，语义文本描述和编码潜在都以极低比特率编码传输。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在保持相同图像重建质量和视觉分析精度的同时，大幅降低了带宽需求。

Conclusion: 该方法为超低比特率视觉通信提供了一种有效解决方案，能够在极低带宽下实现高质量的视觉场景重建和分析。

Abstract: We consider the problem of ultra-low bit rate visual communication for remote
vision analysis, human interactions and control in challenging scenarios with
very low communication bandwidth, such as deep space exploration, battlefield
intelligence, and robot navigation in complex environments. In this paper, we
ask the following important question: can we accurately reconstruct the visual
scene using only a very small portion of the bit rate in existing coding
methods while not sacrificing the accuracy of vision analysis and performance
of human interactions? Existing text-to-image generation models offer a new
approach for ultra-low bitrate image description. However, they can only
achieve a semantic-level approximation of the visual scene, which is far
insufficient for the purpose of visual communication and remote vision analysis
and human interactions. To address this important issue, we propose to
seamlessly integrate image generation with deep image compression, using joint
text and coding latent to guide the rectified flow models for precise
generation of the visual scene. The semantic text description and coding latent
are both encoded and transmitted to the decoder at a very small bit rate.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve the same image
reconstruction quality and vision analysis accuracy as existing methods while
using much less bandwidth. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.

Motivation: 现有方法处理复杂编辑指令时需要联合微调大语言模型和扩散模型，计算复杂度和训练成本很高。

Method: 使用基础模型构建输入图像的结构化语义表示，引入迭代更新机制逐步细化表示，获得细粒度视觉表示。

Result: 在SmartEdit数据集上PSNR提升9.955 dB，在自建CIEBench基准测试中也优于先前方法。

Conclusion: CIELR方法能够有效处理复杂图像编辑任务，保持区域一致性，且无需昂贵的联合训练。

Abstract: Existing image editing methods can handle simple editing instructions very
well. To deal with complex editing instructions, they often need to jointly
fine-tune the large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models (DMs), which
involves very high computational complexity and training cost. To address this
issue, we propose a new method, called \textbf{C}omplex \textbf{I}mage
\textbf{E}diting via \textbf{L}LM \textbf{R}easoning (CIELR), which converts a
complex user instruction into a set of simple and explicit editing actions,
eliminating the need for jointly fine-tuning the large language models and
diffusion models. Specifically, we first construct a structured semantic
representation of the input image using foundation models. Then, we introduce
an iterative update mechanism that can progressively refine this
representation, obtaining a fine-grained visual representation of the image
scene. This allows us to perform complex and flexible image editing tasks.
Extensive experiments on the SmartEdit Reasoning Scenario Set show that our
method surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by 9.955 dB in PSNR, indicating
its superior preservation of regions that should remain consistent. Due to the
limited number of samples of public datasets of complex image editing with
reasoning, we construct a benchmark named CIEBench, containing 86 image
samples, together with a metric specifically for reasoning-based image editing.
CIELR also outperforms previous methods on this benchmark. The code and dataset

Motivation: 现有的CLIP框架主要关注自然图像，对其他重要视觉模态（如视频和视觉文档）的支持有限，需要开发一个统一的多模态嵌入框架来弥补这一差距。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：第一阶段专注于基础文本和多模态检索；第二阶段引入改进的InfoNCE损失，包含难度加权机制和减少假阴性影响的策略，同时使用可学习温度参数和模型融合技术。

Result: 在MMEB基准测试中取得了新的最先进性能，不仅在总体得分上表现最佳，还在具有挑战性的视频和视觉文档检索任务上超越了所有先前工作。

Conclusion: RzenEmbed通过创新的训练策略和损失函数设计，成功构建了一个强大的统一多模态嵌入框架，在各种视觉模态上均表现出色。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has
extended CLIP-based frameworks to produce powerful, universal embeddings for
retrieval tasks. However, existing methods primarily focus on natural images,
offering limited support for other crucial visual modalities such as videos and
visual documents. To bridge this gap, we introduce RzenEmbed, a unified
framework to learn embeddings across a diverse set of modalities, including
text, images, videos, and visual documents. We employ a novel two-stage
training strategy to learn discriminative representations. The first stage
focuses on foundational text and multimodal retrieval. In the second stage, we
introduce an improved InfoNCE loss, incorporating two key enhancements.
Firstly, a hardness-weighted mechanism guides the model to prioritize
challenging samples by assigning them higher weights within each batch.
Secondly, we implement an approach to mitigate the impact of false negatives
and alleviate data noise. This strategy not only enhances the model's
discriminative power but also improves its instruction-following capabilities.
We further boost performance with learnable temperature parameter and model
souping. RzenEmbed sets a new state-of-the-art on the MMEB benchmark. It not
only achieves the best overall score but also outperforms all prior work on the
challenging video and visual document retrieval tasks. Our models are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法存在局限性：基于添加的方法引入推理延迟和工程复杂性，基于选择的方法需要完整反向传播，内存使用与全微调相同。

Method: FPS通过参数幅度与对应输入激活的乘积来排序参数，利用预训练知识和下游数据，在单次前向传递中完成参数选择。

Result: 在24个视觉任务上，FPS达到与最先进方法相当的性能，同时峰值内存使用减少约9倍，参数选择加速约2倍。

Conclusion: FPS提供了一种真正内存高效且实用的解决方案，适用于大规模预训练模型的微调。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a key strategy for
adapting large-scale pre-trained models to downstream tasks, but existing
approaches face notable limitations. Addition-based methods, such as Adapters
[1], introduce inference latency and engineering complexity, while
selection-based methods like Gradient-based Parameter Selection (GPS) [2]
require a full backward pass, which results in the same peak memory usage as
full fine-tuning. To address this dilemma, we propose Feedforward-based
Parameter Selection (FPS), a gradient-free method that identifies an optimal
parameter subset in a single forward pass. FPS ranks parameters by the product
of their magnitudes and corresponding input activations, leveraging both
pre-trained knowledge and downstream data. Evaluated on $24$ visual tasks from
FGVC and VTAB-1k, FPS achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art
methods while reducing peak memory usage by nearly $9 \times$ and accelerating
parameter selection by about $2 \times$, offering a genuinely memory-efficient
and practical solution for fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models.

Abstract: The prevailing video retrieval paradigm is structurally misaligned, as narrow
benchmarks incentivize correspondingly limited data and single-task training.
Therefore, universal capability is suppressed due to the absence of a
diagnostic evaluation that defines and demands multi-dimensional
generalization. To break this cycle, we introduce a framework built on the
co-design of evaluation, data, and modeling. First, we establish the Universal
Video Retrieval Benchmark (UVRB), a suite of 16 datasets designed not only to
measure performance but also to diagnose critical capability gaps across tasks
and domains. Second, guided by UVRB's diagnostics, we introduce a scalable
synthesis workflow that generates 1.55 million high-quality pairs to populate
the semantic space required for universality. Finally, we devise the Modality
Pyramid, a curriculum that trains our General Video Embedder (GVE) by
explicitly leveraging the latent interconnections within our diverse data.
Extensive experiments show GVE achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot
generalization on UVRB. In particular, our analysis reveals that popular
benchmarks are poor predictors of general ability and that partially relevant
retrieval is a dominant but overlooked scenario. Overall, our co-designed
framework provides a practical path to escape the limited scope and advance
toward truly universal video retrieval.

TL;DR: 提出了一个两阶段微调流程，使用LoRA技术在小数据集上高效训练视频扩散模型，实现电视剧和电影制作的场景合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为电视剧和电影制作提供实用的视频合成方案，能够从小型数据集中学习视觉风格并生成连贯的视频序列。

Method: 两阶段流程：第一阶段在Wan2.1 I2V-14B模型的交叉注意力层集成LoRA模块进行视觉风格学习；第二阶段生成关键帧并通过视频解码器扩展为720p序列。

Result: 定量和定性评估显示在电影保真度和时间稳定性方面相比基础模型有显著提升，支持单GPU快速训练。

Conclusion: 该流程为电影制作领域提供了高效、可复现的视频合成解决方案，支持跨电影领域的适应。

Abstract: We present a practical pipeline for fine-tuning open-source video diffusion
transformers to synthesize cinematic scenes for television and film production
from small datasets. The proposed two-stage process decouples visual style
learning from motion generation. In the first stage, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
modules are integrated into the cross-attention layers of the Wan2.1 I2V-14B
model to adapt its visual representations using a compact dataset of short
clips from Ay Yapim's historical television film El Turco. This enables
efficient domain transfer within hours on a single GPU. In the second stage,
the fine-tuned model produces stylistically consistent keyframes that preserve
costume, lighting, and color grading, which are then temporally expanded into
coherent 720p sequences through the model's video decoder. We further apply
lightweight parallelization and sequence partitioning strategies to accelerate
inference without quality degradation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
using FVD, CLIP-SIM, and LPIPS metrics, supported by a small expert user study,
demonstrate measurable improvements in cinematic fidelity and temporal
stability over the base model. The complete training and inference pipeline is
released to support reproducibility and adaptation across cinematic domains.

Motivation: 现有方法从文本中提取层次特征，但仅用单一特征表示图像，导致模态对齐不对称且效果不佳。

Method: 构建语义感知的视觉特征提取框架，使用交叉注意力机制从Transformer中间层提取粗到细的视觉特征；将特征树嵌入不同曲率的双曲流形；通过最小化异构流形间的KL距离学习中间流形进行对齐。

Result: 在多个图像数据集上的分类任务中，该方法在少样本和跨域设置下持续优于强基线。

Conclusion: 证明了最优中间流形的存在性和唯一性，提出的异构双曲流形对齐方法能有效解决视觉语言模型中的模态不对称问题。

Abstract: Modality alignment is critical for vision-language models (VLMs) to
effectively integrate information across modalities. However, existing methods
extract hierarchical features from text while representing each image with a
single feature, leading to asymmetric and suboptimal alignment. To address
this, we propose Alignment across Trees, a method that constructs and aligns
tree-like hierarchical features for both image and text modalities.
Specifically, we introduce a semantic-aware visual feature extraction framework
that applies a cross-attention mechanism to visual class tokens from
intermediate Transformer layers, guided by textual cues to extract visual
features with coarse-to-fine semantics. We then embed the feature trees of the
two modalities into hyperbolic manifolds with distinct curvatures to
effectively model their hierarchical structures. To align across the
heterogeneous hyperbolic manifolds with different curvatures, we formulate a KL
distance measure between distributions on heterogeneous manifolds, and learn an
intermediate manifold for manifold alignment by minimizing the distance. We
prove the existence and uniqueness of the optimal intermediate manifold.
Experiments on taxonomic open-set classification tasks across multiple image
datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines
under few-shot and cross-domain settings.

*Sales Aribe Jr*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种融合法证特征和深度学习表示的混合框架，用于深度伪造检测，在多个基准数据集上优于单方法基线，并表现出良好的鲁棒性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着GAN和扩散模型的发展，合成媒体越来越逼真，引发了关于虚假信息、身份欺诈和数字信任的社会担忧。现有的深度伪造检测方法存在泛化能力差或对新操纵技术有限的局限性。

Method: 提出混合框架，融合法证特征（包括噪声残差、JPEG压缩痕迹和频域描述符）与深度学习表示（来自CNN和ViT）。

Result: 在FaceForensics++、Celeb-DF v2和DFDC数据集上分别达到F1分数0.96、0.82和0.77，在压缩、对抗扰动和未见操纵下保持稳定性能，可解释性分析显示82%情况下热图与真实操纵区域重叠。

Conclusion: 混合方法提供了平衡解决方案，结合了深度模型的适应性和法证线索的可解释性，可开发具有弹性和可信度的深度伪造检测系统。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion
models has made synthetic media increasingly realistic, raising societal
concerns around misinformation, identity fraud, and digital trust. Existing
deepfake detection methods either rely on deep learning, which suffers from
poor generalization and vulnerability to distortions, or forensic analysis,
which is interpretable but limited against new manipulation techniques. This
study proposes a hybrid framework that fuses forensic features, including noise
residuals, JPEG compression traces, and frequency-domain descriptors, with deep
learning representations from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision
transformers (ViTs). Evaluated on benchmark datasets (FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF
v2, DFDC), the proposed model consistently outperformed single-method baselines
and demonstrated superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
hybrid approaches, achieving F1-scores of 0.96, 0.82, and 0.77, respectively.
Robustness tests demonstrated stable performance under compression (F1 = 0.87
at QF = 50), adversarial perturbations (AUC = 0.84), and unseen manipulations
(F1 = 0.79). Importantly, explainability analysis showed that Grad-CAM and
forensic heatmaps overlapped with ground-truth manipulated regions in 82
percent of cases, enhancing transparency and user trust. These findings confirm
that hybrid approaches provide a balanced solution, combining the adaptability
of deep models with the interpretability of forensic cues, to develop resilient
and trustworthy deepfake detection systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型旨在改进诊断工作流程，但分割偏见评估在分类之外仍未被充分探索。未解决的分割偏见可能导致某些人群的护理质量差异，并在临床决策点中复合，通过迭代模型开发而放大。

Method: 审计MAMA-MIA乳腺癌肿瘤分割数据集中自动分割标签的公平性，评估跨年龄、种族和数据源的分割质量。

Result: 分析揭示了针对年轻患者的内在年龄相关偏见，即使在控制数据源等混杂因素后仍然存在。多数据源聚合会影响特定地点的种族偏见。

Conclusion: 需要在细粒度层面调查数据，以解决分割模型中的公平性问题，特别是年龄和种族相关的偏见。

Abstract: Deep learning models aim to improve diagnostic workflows, but fairness
evaluation remains underexplored beyond classification, e.g., in image
segmentation. Unaddressed segmentation bias can lead to disparities in the
quality of care for certain populations, potentially compounded across clinical
decision points and amplified through iterative model development. Here, we
audit the fairness of the automated segmentation labels provided in the breast
cancer tumor segmentation dataset MAMA-MIA. We evaluate automated segmentation
quality across age, ethnicity, and data source. Our analysis reveals an
intrinsic age-related bias against younger patients that continues to persist
even after controlling for confounding factors, such as data source. We
hypothesize that this bias may be linked to physiological factors, a known
challenge for both radiologists and automated systems. Finally, we show how
aggregating data from multiple data sources influences site-specific ethnic
biases, underscoring the necessity of investigating data at a granular level.

TL;DR: 提出了解决部分相关视频检索中语义坍缩问题的新方法，通过文本相关性保持学习和跨分支视频对齐来提升检索性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将所有标注的文本-视频对视为正样本，其他视为负样本，忽略了视频内部和跨视频的丰富语义变化，导致同一视频中不同事件的嵌入坍缩在一起，而不同视频中语义相似的查询和片段却被分开，限制了检索性能

Method: 1. 文本相关性保持学习：保持基础模型编码的文本查询间的语义关系；2. 跨分支视频对齐：通过对比对齐方法在不同时间尺度上解缠层次化视频表示；3. 顺序保持标记合并和自适应CBVA来增强对齐效果

Result: 在PRVR基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该框架有效防止了语义坍缩，显著提高了检索准确率

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功解决了PRVR中的语义坍缩问题，通过保持文本语义关系和跨尺度视频对齐，显著提升了部分相关视频检索的性能

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) seeks videos where only part of the
content matches a text query. Existing methods treat every annotated text-video
pair as a positive and all others as negatives, ignoring the rich semantic
variation both within a single video and across different videos. Consequently,
embeddings of both queries and their corresponding video-clip segments for
distinct events within the same video collapse together, while embeddings of
semantically similar queries and segments from different videos are driven
apart. This limits retrieval performance when videos contain multiple, diverse
events. This paper addresses the aforementioned problems, termed as semantic
collapse, in both the text and video embedding spaces. We first introduce Text
Correlation Preservation Learning, which preserves the semantic relationships
encoded by the foundation model across text queries. To address collapse in
video embeddings, we propose Cross-Branch Video Alignment (CBVA), a contrastive
alignment method that disentangles hierarchical video representations across
temporal scales. Subsequently, we introduce order-preserving token merging and
adaptive CBVA to enhance alignment by producing video segments that are
internally coherent yet mutually distinctive. Extensive experiments on PRVR
benchmarks demonstrate that our framework effectively prevents semantic
collapse and substantially improves retrieval accuracy.

TL;DR: DeblurSDI是一种零样本、自监督的盲图像去模糊框架，基于自扩散过程，无需预训练即可动态学习针对输入图像的特定先验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统盲图像去模糊方法依赖手工先验，而现代深度学习方法需要大量外部数据集预训练，限制了在实际场景中的适应性。

Method: 将盲去模糊建模为迭代反向自扩散过程，从纯噪声开始逐步优化解决方案。使用两个随机初始化的神经网络持续优化清晰图像和模糊核，结合数据一致性和核的L1稀疏约束。

Result: DeblurSDI在广泛实验中表现出优越性能，即使在高度退化场景下也能恢复清晰图像和准确核。

Conclusion: 该方法通过创新的噪声调度机制提供显著鲁棒性，能够动态学习实例特定的先验，在盲图像去模糊任务中取得一致优越结果。

Abstract: Blind image deconvolution is a challenging ill-posed inverse problem, where
both the latent sharp image and the blur kernel are unknown. Traditional
methods often rely on handcrafted priors, while modern deep learning approaches
typically require extensive pre-training on large external datasets, limiting
their adaptability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose DeblurSDI,
a zero-shot, self-supervised framework based on self-diffusion (SDI) that
requires no prior training. DeblurSDI formulates blind deconvolution as an
iterative reverse self-diffusion process that starts from pure noise and
progressively refines the solution. At each step, two randomly-initialized
neural networks are optimized continuously to refine the sharp image and the
blur kernel. The optimization is guided by an objective function combining data
consistency with a sparsity-promoting L1-norm for the kernel. A key innovation
is our noise scheduling mechanism, which stabilizes the optimization and
provides remarkable robustness to variations in blur kernel size. These allow
DeblurSDI to dynamically learn an instance-specific prior tailored to the input
image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeblurSDI consistently achieves
superior performance, recovering sharp images and accurate kernels even in
highly degraded scenarios.

Method: CoMViT集成了卷积分词器、对角掩码、动态温度缩放和基于池化的序列聚合，通过系统架构优化实现性能提升。

Result: 在12个MedMNIST数据集上实现稳健性能，仅约450万参数，匹配或超越更深层的CNN和ViT变体，参数减少5-20倍而不牺牲准确性。

Conclusion: 结果突出了原则性ViT重新设计在低资源医学成像环境中开发高效可解释模型的潜力。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong potential in medical
imaging; however, their high computational demands and tendency to overfit on
small datasets limit their applicability in real-world clinical scenarios. In
this paper, we present CoMViT, a compact and generalizable Vision Transformer
architecture optimized for resource-constrained medical image analysis. CoMViT
integrates a convolutional tokenizer, diagonal masking, dynamic temperature
scaling, and pooling-based sequence aggregation to improve performance and
generalization. Through systematic architectural optimization, CoMViT achieves
robust performance across twelve MedMNIST datasets while maintaining a
lightweight design with only ~4.5M parameters. It matches or outperforms deeper
CNN and ViT variants, offering up to 5-20x parameter reduction without
sacrificing accuracy. Qualitative Grad-CAM analyses show that CoMViT
consistently attends to clinically relevant regions despite its compact size.
These results highlight the potential of principled ViT redesign for developing
efficient and interpretable models in low-resource medical imaging settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前科学插图生成面临两大局限：图像生成模型缺乏语义结构无法编辑独立组件，代码方法虽然可控但不够直观。需要兼顾效率、直观性和迭代修改的需求。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，包含Manager、Designer和Toolbox三个专门模块协作生成矢量图，支持元素级显式表示和操作。

Conclusion: VisPainter框架成功实现了科学插图的元素级控制和后期编辑能力，为高效、直观的科学创作提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Scientific illustrations demand both high information density and
post-editability. However, current generative models have two major
limitations: Frist, image generation models output rasterized images lacking
semantic structure, making it impossible to access, edit, or rearrange
independent visual components in the images. Second, code-based generation
methods (TikZ or SVG), although providing element-level control, force users
into the cumbersome cycle of "writing-compiling-reviewing" and lack the
intuitiveness of manipulation. Neither of these two approaches can well meet
the needs for efficiency, intuitiveness, and iterative modification in
scientific creation. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisPainter, a multi-agent
framework for scientific illustration built upon the model context protocol.
VisPainter orchestrates three specialized modules-a Manager, a Designer, and a
Toolbox-to collaboratively produce diagrams compatible with standard vector
graphics software. This modular, role-based design allows each element to be
explicitly represented and manipulated, enabling true element-level control and
any element can be added and modified later. To systematically evaluate the
quality of scientific illustrations, we introduce VisBench, a benchmark with
seven-dimensional evaluation metrics. It assesses high-information-density
scientific illustrations from four aspects: content, layout, visual perception,
and interaction cost. To this end, we conducted extensive ablation experiments
to verify the rationality of our architecture and the reliability of our
evaluation methods. Finally, we evaluated various vision-language models,
presenting fair and credible model rankings along with detailed comparisons of
their respective capabilities. Additionally, we isolated and quantified the
impacts of role division, step control,and description on the quality of
illustrations.

Motivation: 在发展中地区，教育设施数据往往稀缺且更新不及时，需要一种能够提高学校地图绘制准确性和完整性的方法。

Method: 采用多层级方法：第一层使用机器学习分析人口密度、土地覆盖和现有基础设施；第二层使用中分辨率卫星图像识别可能包含学校的区域；第三层使用超高分辨率图像和深度学习模型生成详细的候选学校位置。整个过程包含人机交互界面进行迭代验证。

Result: 初步评估表明，该多层级策略为教育基础设施地图绘制提供了可扩展且成本效益高的解决方案。中分辨率方法因改进不显著而被移除。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合机器学习和人机交互，能够有效支持教育规划和资源分配，特别是在数据稀缺的环境中。

Abstract: This paper presents a multi-tiered human-in-the-loop framework for
interactive school mapping designed to improve the accuracy and completeness of
educational facility records, particularly in developing regions where such
data may be scarce and infrequently updated. The first tier involves a machine
learning based analysis of population density, land cover, and existing
infrastructure compared with known school locations. The first tier identifies
potential gaps and "mislabelled" schools. In subsequent tiers,
medium-resolution satellite imagery (Sentinel-2) is investigated to pinpoint
regions with a high likelihood of school presence, followed by the application
of very high-resolution (VHR) imagery and deep learning models to generate
detailed candidate locations for schools within these prioritised areas. The
medium-resolution approach was later removed due to insignificant improvements.
The medium and VHR resolution models build upon global pre-trained steps to
improve generalisation. A key component of the proposed approach is an
interactive interface to allow human operators to iteratively review, validate,
and refine the mapping results. Preliminary evaluations indicate that the
multi-tiered strategy provides a scalable and cost-effective solution for
educational infrastructure mapping to support planning and resource allocation.

Abstract: Since deepfakes generated by advanced generative models have rapidly posed
serious threats, existing audiovisual deepfake detection approaches struggle to
generalize to unseen forgeries. We propose a novel reference-aware audiovisual
deepfake detection method, called Referee. Speaker-specific cues from only
one-shot examples are leveraged to detect manipulations beyond spatiotemporal
artifacts. By matching and aligning identity-related queries from reference and
target content into cross-modal features, Referee jointly reasons about
audiovisual synchrony and identity consistency. Extensive experiments on
FakeAVCeleb, FaceForensics++, and KoDF demonstrate that Referee achieves
state-of-the-art performance on cross-dataset and cross-language evaluation
protocols. Experimental results highlight the importance of cross-modal
identity verification for future deepfake detection. The code is available at

Abstract: Underwater exploration offers critical insights into our planet and attracts
increasing attention for its broader applications in resource exploration,
national security, etc. We study the underwater scene understanding methods,
which aim to achieve automated underwater exploration. The underwater scene
understanding task demands multi-task perceptions from multiple granularities.
However, the absence of large-scale underwater multi-task instruction-tuning
datasets hinders the progress of this research. To bridge this gap, we
construct NautData, a dataset containing 1.45 M image-text pairs supporting
eight underwater scene understanding tasks. It enables the development and
thorough evaluation of the underwater scene understanding models. Underwater
image degradation is a widely recognized challenge that interferes with
underwater tasks. To improve the robustness of underwater scene understanding,
we introduce physical priors derived from underwater imaging models and propose
a plug-and-play vision feature enhancement (VFE) module, which explicitly
restores clear underwater information. We integrate this module into renowned
baselines LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen2.5-VL and build our underwater LMM, NAUTILUS.
Experiments conducted on the NautData and public underwater datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the VFE module, consistently improving the
performance of both baselines on the majority of supported tasks, thus ensuring
the superiority of NAUTILUS in the underwater scene understanding area. Data

Motivation: 多模态推理需要语言和视觉之间的迭代协调，但目前尚不清楚什么构成了有意义的交错思维链。作者认为文本和图像思维应该作为互补而非同构的模态，相互促进推理。

Method: 构建ThinkMorph模型，在24K高质量交错推理轨迹上进行统一微调，涵盖不同视觉参与度的任务。模型学习生成渐进式的文本-图像推理步骤，具体操作视觉内容同时保持连贯的言语逻辑。

Conclusion: 这些发现为表征统一多模态推理模型的新兴能力提供了有前景的方向，表明互补的文本-图像思维能够有效促进多模态推理。

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning requires iterative coordination between language and
vision, yet it remains unclear what constitutes a meaningful interleaved chain
of thought. We posit that text and image thoughts should function as
complementary, rather than isomorphic, modalities that mutually advance
reasoning. Guided by this principle, we build ThinkMorph, a unified model
fine-tuned on 24K high-quality interleaved reasoning traces spanning tasks with
varying visual engagement. ThinkMorph learns to generate progressive text-image
reasoning steps that concretely manipulate visual content while maintaining
coherent verbal logic. It delivers large gains on vision-centric benchmarks
(averaging 34.7% over the base model) and generalizes to out-of-domain tasks,
matching or surpassing larger and proprietary VLMs. Beyond performance,
ThinkMorph exhibits emergent multimodal intelligence, including unseen visual
manipulation skills, adaptive switching between reasoning modes, and better
test-time scaling through diversified multimodal thoughts.These findings
suggest promising directions for characterizing the emergent capabilities of
unified models for multimodal reasoning.

Result: 深度学习提取方法显著优于传统SVD方法，在裁剪(70%)攻击下，深度学习达到0.83的比特准确率和0.80的IoU，而SVD仅为0.58和0.26。

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现优越的水印恢复能力，即使在严重失真条件下也能保持高保真度，为3D点云版权保护提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The protection of intellectual property has become critical due to the rapid
growth of three-dimensional content in digital media. Unlike traditional images
or videos, 3D point clouds present unique challenges for copyright enforcement,
as they are especially vulnerable to a range of geometric and non-geometric
attacks that can easily degrade or remove conventional watermark signals. In
this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a robust deep neural
watermarking framework for 3D point cloud copyright protection and ownership
verification. Our approach embeds binary watermarks into the singular values of
3D point cloud blocks using spectral decomposition, i.e. Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD), and leverages the extraction capabilities of Deep Learning
using PointNet++ neural network architecture. The network is trained to
reliably extract watermarks even after the data undergoes various attacks such
as rotation, scaling, noise, cropping and signal distortions. We validated our
method using the publicly available ModelNet40 dataset, demonstrating that deep
learning-based extraction significantly outperforms traditional SVD-based
techniques under challenging conditions. Our experimental evaluation
demonstrates that the deep learning-based extraction approach significantly
outperforms existing SVD-based methods with deep learning achieving bitwise
accuracy up to 0.83 and Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.80, compared to SVD
achieving a bitwise accuracy of 0.58 and IoU of 0.26 for the Crop (70%) attack,
which is the most severe geometric distortion in our experiment. This
demonstrates our method's ability to achieve superior watermark recovery and
maintain high fidelity even under severe distortions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MapSAM2是一个基于视觉基础模型的统一框架，用于自动分割历史地图图像和时间序列，通过将地图处理为视频格式来提升分割精度，并提出了伪时间序列生成方法来降低标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史地图是记录不同时期地理特征的宝贵档案，但由于风格多样性和标注数据稀缺，其自动分析面临挑战。构建链接的时空数据集对于建筑年代确定、道路网络发展和环境变化研究等应用至关重要。

Method: 基于视觉基础模型，将历史地图图像和时间序列视为视频处理。对于图像，将图块集作为视频处理以利用记忆注意力机制；对于时间序列，提出通过模拟时间变换从单年地图生成伪时间序列来减少标注成本。

Result: 实验结果表明，MapSAM2能够有效学习时间关联，在有限监督或使用伪视频的情况下，能够准确分割和链接时间序列中的建筑物。

Conclusion: MapSAM2为历史地图分析提供了有效的解决方案，通过视频化处理和伪时间序列生成方法，显著提升了分割精度并降低了标注成本，将发布数据集和代码支持后续研究。

Abstract: Historical maps are unique and valuable archives that document geographic
features across different time periods. However, automated analysis of
historical map images remains a significant challenge due to their wide
stylistic variability and the scarcity of annotated training data. Constructing
linked spatio-temporal datasets from historical map time series is even more
time-consuming and labor-intensive, as it requires synthesizing information
from multiple maps. Such datasets are essential for applications such as dating
buildings, analyzing the development of road networks and settlements, studying
environmental changes etc. We present MapSAM2, a unified framework for
automatically segmenting both historical map images and time series. Built on a
visual foundation model, MapSAM2 adapts to diverse segmentation tasks with
few-shot fine-tuning. Our key innovation is to treat both historical map images
and time series as videos. For images, we process a set of tiles as a video,
enabling the memory attention mechanism to incorporate contextual cues from
similar tiles, leading to improved geometric accuracy, particularly for areal
features. For time series, we introduce the annotated Siegfried Building Time
Series Dataset and, to reduce annotation costs, propose generating pseudo time
series from single-year maps by simulating common temporal transformations.
Experimental results show that MapSAM2 learns temporal associations effectively
and can accurately segment and link buildings in time series under limited
supervision or using pseudo videos. We will release both our dataset and code
to support future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CroVCA提出了一种简单统一的二进制编码学习原则，通过交叉视图代码对齐和编码率最大化正则化，在5个训练周期内实现最先进的哈希性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模检索中高维嵌入搜索计算成本高的问题，现有哈希方法存在复杂流程、多目标优化、单一学习范式专业化设计以及训练时间长等局限性。

Method: 使用单个二元交叉熵损失强制代码对齐，编码率最大化作为抗崩溃正则化器促进平衡多样化编码，设计轻量级HashCoder MLP哈希网络，支持冻结嵌入探测或LoRA微调。

Result: 在16位编码下表现优异，COCO无监督哈希在2分钟内完成，ImageNet100监督哈希在3分钟内完成，在多个基准测试中达到最先进结果。

Conclusion: CroVCA展示了高效性、适应性和广泛适用性，为大规模检索提供了简单而强大的哈希解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient large-scale retrieval requires representations that are both
compact and discriminative. Foundation models provide powerful visual and
multimodal embeddings, but nearest neighbor search in these high-dimensional
spaces is computationally expensive. Hashing offers an efficient alternative by
enabling fast Hamming distance search with binary codes, yet existing
approaches often rely on complex pipelines, multi-term objectives, designs
specialized for a single learning paradigm, and long training times. We
introduce CroVCA (Cross-View Code Alignment), a simple and unified principle
for learning binary codes that remain consistent across semantically aligned
views. A single binary cross-entropy loss enforces alignment, while coding-rate
maximization serves as an anti-collapse regularizer to promote balanced and
diverse codes. To implement this, we design HashCoder, a lightweight MLP
hashing network with a final batch normalization layer to enforce balanced
codes. HashCoder can be used as a probing head on frozen embeddings or to adapt
encoders efficiently via LoRA fine-tuning. Across benchmarks, CroVCA achieves
state-of-the-art results in just 5 training epochs. At 16 bits, it particularly
well-for instance, unsupervised hashing on COCO completes in under 2 minutes
and supervised hashing on ImageNet100 in about 3 minutes on a single GPU. These
results highlight CroVCA's efficiency, adaptability, and broad applicability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ANCHOR框架，通过监督对比学习和硬正样本挖掘来增强模型对抗性鲁棒性，使原始图像、增强图像和扰动版本在嵌入空间中聚集，同时与其他类别分离。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络虽然强大，但其依赖的梯度学习机制容易受到对抗性攻击，即微小不可察觉的扰动就能改变模型预测结果。现有方法在准确性和鲁棒性之间存在权衡。

Method: 结合对抗性训练和硬正样本挖掘的监督对比学习框架，使同类样本的不同版本在嵌入空间中聚集，同时与其他类别分离，让模型关注稳定有意义的模式而非脆弱的梯度线索。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，使用PGD-20攻击(epsilon=0.031)时，在干净准确率和鲁棒准确率方面都取得了优异结果，优于标准对抗训练方法。

Conclusion: 将对抗性指导与硬挖掘对比监督相结合，有助于模型学习更具结构性和鲁棒性的表示，缩小准确性和鲁棒性之间的差距。

Abstract: Neural networks have changed the way machines interpret the world. At their
core, they learn by following gradients, adjusting their parameters step by
step until they identify the most discriminant patterns in the data. This
process gives them their strength, yet it also opens the door to a hidden flaw.
The very gradients that help a model learn can also be used to produce small,
imperceptible tweaks that cause the model to completely alter its decision.
Such tweaks are called adversarial attacks. These attacks exploit this
vulnerability by adding tiny, imperceptible changes to images that, while
leaving them identical to the human eye, cause the model to make wrong
predictions. In this work, we propose Adversarially-trained Contrastive
Hard-mining for Optimized Robustness (ANCHOR), a framework that leverages the
power of supervised contrastive learning with explicit hard positive mining to
enable the model to learn representations for images such that the embeddings
for the images, their augmentations, and their perturbed versions cluster
together in the embedding space along with those for other images of the same
class while being separated from images of other classes. This alignment helps
the model focus on stable, meaningful patterns rather than fragile gradient
cues. On CIFAR-10, our approach achieves impressive results for both clean and
robust accuracy under PGD-20 (epsilon = 0.031), outperforming standard
adversarial training methods. Our results indicate that combining adversarial
guidance with hard-mined contrastive supervision helps models learn more
structured and robust representations, narrowing the gap between accuracy and
robustness.

Motivation: 生成扩散模型创建的合成图像越来越难以与真实图像区分，引发了真实性、版权和错误信息方面的担忧。现有监督检测器难以泛化到未见过的生成器，需要大量标注数据和频繁重新训练。

Method: 利用预训练扩散模型的内部激活特征，通过k近邻分类器进行深度伪造检测，使用紧凑神经网络模型进行来源生成器识别。

Result: 在跨生成器检测方面达到最先进性能，无需微调即可准确识别合成图像及其来源生成器。

Conclusion: 扩散表示固有地编码了生成器特定的模式，为合成图像取证提供了简单且可解释的基础。

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative diffusion models has enabled the creation of
synthetic images that are increasingly difficult to distinguish from real ones,
raising concerns about authenticity, copyright, and misinformation. Existing
supervised detectors often struggle to generalize across unseen generators,
requiring extensive labeled data and frequent retraining. We introduce FRIDA
(Fake-image Recognition and source Identification via Diffusion-features
Analysis), a lightweight framework that leverages internal activations from a
pre-trained diffusion model for deepfake detection and source generator
attribution. A k-nearest-neighbor classifier applied to diffusion features
achieves state-of-the-art cross-generator performance without fine-tuning,
while a compact neural model enables accurate source attribution. These results
show that diffusion representations inherently encode generator-specific
patterns, providing a simple and interpretable foundation for synthetic image
forensics.

TL;DR: Spatial-SSRL是一种自监督强化学习范式，通过从普通RGB或RGB-D图像中提取可验证信号，自动构建五个空间结构理解任务，显著提升大视觉语言模型的空间推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大视觉语言模型在空间理解方面存在不足，而传统的监督微调和强化学习方法依赖昂贵的监督数据、专用工具或受限环境，限制了规模化应用。

Method: 提出自监督强化学习范式Spatial-SSRL，自动构建五个空间结构理解任务：打乱补丁重排序、翻转补丁识别、裁剪补丁修复、区域深度排序和相对3D位置预测，这些任务提供易于验证的ground-truth答案，无需人工或LVLM标注。

Result: 在七个空间理解基准测试中（包括图像和视频设置），Spatial-SSRL相比Qwen2.5-VL基线在3B和7B模型上分别实现了4.63%和3.89%的平均准确率提升，同时保持了通用视觉能力。

Conclusion: 简单、内在的监督能够实现大规模的强化学习与可验证奖励，为大视觉语言模型提供了一条实用的增强空间智能的路径。

Abstract: Spatial understanding remains a weakness of Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs). Existing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and recent reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) pipelines depend on costly supervision,
specialized tools, or constrained environments that limit scale. We introduce
Spatial-SSRL, a self-supervised RL paradigm that derives verifiable signals
directly from ordinary RGB or RGB-D images. Spatial-SSRL automatically
formulates five pretext tasks that capture 2D and 3D spatial structure:
shuffled patch reordering, flipped patch recognition, cropped patch inpainting,
regional depth ordering, and relative 3D position prediction. These tasks
provide ground-truth answers that are easy to verify and require no human or
LVLM annotation. Training on our tasks substantially improves spatial reasoning
while preserving general visual capabilities. On seven spatial understanding
benchmarks in both image and video settings, Spatial-SSRL delivers average
accuracy gains of 4.63% (3B) and 3.89% (7B) over the Qwen2.5-VL baselines. Our
results show that simple, intrinsic supervision enables RLVR at scale and
provides a practical route to stronger spatial intelligence in LVLMs.

Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言-动作模型在联合预测下一状态观察和动作序列时面临模态差异的挑战，需要解决模态冲突问题以提升机器人策略学习性能。

Method: 提出多模态扩散transformer架构，维护分离的模态流但允许跨模态知识共享；引入独立噪声扰动和解耦流匹配损失；支持测试时缩放的非同步联合采样方法。

Conclusion: DUST通过解耦模态训练和双向联合分布学习，有效解决了VLA模型中的模态冲突问题，在模拟和真实环境中都表现出优越性能，具有大规模预训练的潜力。

Abstract: Recently, augmenting Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) with world modeling
has shown promise in improving robotic policy learning. However, it remains
challenging to jointly predict next-state observations and action sequences
because of the inherent difference between the two modalities. To address this,
we propose DUal-STream diffusion (DUST), a world-model augmented VLA framework
that handles the modality conflict and enhances the performance of VLAs across
diverse tasks. Specifically, we propose a multimodal diffusion transformer
architecture that explicitly maintains separate modality streams while still
enabling cross-modal knowledge sharing. In addition, we introduce independent
noise perturbations for each modality and a decoupled flow-matching loss. This
design enables the model to learn the joint distribution in a bidirectional
manner while avoiding the need for a unified latent space. Based on the
decoupling of modalities during training, we also introduce a joint sampling
method that supports test-time scaling, where action and vision tokens evolve
asynchronously at different rates. Through experiments on simulated benchmarks
such as RoboCasa and GR-1, DUST achieves up to 6% gains over baseline methods,
while our test-time scaling approach provides an additional 2-5% boost. On
real-world tasks with the Franka Research 3, DUST improves success rates by
13%, confirming its effectiveness beyond simulation. Furthermore, pre-training
on action-free videos from BridgeV2 yields significant transfer gains on
RoboCasa, underscoring DUST's potential for large-scale VLA pretraining.

Abstract: Graphic layout generation is a growing research area focusing on generating
aesthetically pleasing layouts ranging from poster designs to documents. While
recent research has explored ways to incorporate user constraints to guide the
layout generation, these constraints often require complex specifications which
reduce usability. We introduce an innovative approach exploiting user-provided
sketches as intuitive constraints and we demonstrate empirically the
effectiveness of this new guidance method, establishing the sketch-to-layout
problem as a promising research direction, which is currently under-explored.
To tackle the sketch-to-layout problem, we propose a multimodal
transformer-based solution using the sketch and the content assets as inputs to
produce high quality layouts. Since collecting sketch training data from human
annotators to train our model is very costly, we introduce a novel and
efficient method to synthetically generate training sketches at scale. We train
and evaluate our model on three publicly available datasets: PubLayNet,
DocLayNet and SlidesVQA, demonstrating that it outperforms state-of-the-art
constraint-based methods, while offering a more intuitive design experience. In
order to facilitate future sketch-to-layout research, we release O(200k)
synthetically-generated sketches for the public datasets above. The datasets
are available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/sketch_to_layout.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像血管分割面临标注数据稀缺和模型跨模态泛化能力差的问题，CNN倾向于学习纹理特征限制了其在新域中的性能。假设利用血管的几何先验（管状和分支结构）可以构建更鲁棒和数据高效的模型。

Method: 引入VessShape方法，生成大规模2D合成数据集，包含程序化生成的管状几何结构与多样化前景背景纹理，促使模型学习形状线索而非纹理特征。

Result: 在VessShape上预训练的模型在两个真实世界数据集上表现出强大的少样本分割性能，仅需4-10个样本进行微调。模型还展现出显著的零样本能力，能在未见域中有效分割血管而无需目标特定训练。

Conclusion: 具有强形状偏置的预训练是克服数据稀缺和提升血管分割模型泛化能力的有效策略。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of blood vessels is an important task in medical image
analysis, but its progress is often hindered by the scarcity of large annotated
datasets and the poor generalization of models across different imaging
modalities. A key aspect is the tendency of Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) to learn texture-based features, which limits their performance when
applied to new domains with different visual characteristics. We hypothesize
that leveraging geometric priors of vessel shapes, such as their tubular and
branching nature, can lead to more robust and data-efficient models. To
investigate this, we introduce VessShape, a methodology for generating
large-scale 2D synthetic datasets designed to instill a shape bias in
segmentation models. VessShape images contain procedurally generated tubular
geometries combined with a wide variety of foreground and background textures,
encouraging models to learn shape cues rather than textures. We demonstrate
that a model pre-trained on VessShape images achieves strong few-shot
segmentation performance on two real-world datasets from different domains,
requiring only four to ten samples for fine-tuning. Furthermore, the model
exhibits notable zero-shot capabilities, effectively segmenting vessels in
unseen domains without any target-specific training. Our results indicate that
pre-training with a strong shape bias can be an effective strategy to overcome
data scarcity and improve model generalization in blood vessel segmentation.

Motivation: 异构感知模型在协作感知中存在领域差距问题，现有方法将特定代理表示作为共同表示，导致与差异较大代理难以对齐。

Method: 引入协商器从各模态代理的局部表示中推导共同表示，使用发送器和接收器实现特征空间转换，并采用结构、语用和分布三重对齐损失。

Result: 有效减少了与各种局部表示之间的固有领域差距，实现了更好的特征对齐。

Conclusion: NegoCollab通过协商共同表示和多层次对齐，成功解决了异构协作感知中的领域差距问题。

Abstract: Collaborative perception improves task performance by expanding the
perception range through information sharing among agents. . Immutable
heterogeneity poses a significant challenge in collaborative perception, as
participating agents may employ different and fixed perception models. This
leads to domain gaps in the intermediate features shared among agents,
consequently degrading collaborative performance. Aligning the features of all
agents to a common representation can eliminate domain gaps with low training
cost. However, in existing methods, the common representation is designated as
the representation of a specific agent, making it difficult for agents with
significant domain discrepancies from this specific agent to achieve proper
alignment. This paper proposes NegoCollab, a heterogeneous collaboration method
based on the negotiated common representation. It introduces a negotiator
during training to derive the common representation from the local
representations of each modality's agent, effectively reducing the inherent
domain gap with the various local representations. In NegoCollab, the mutual
transformation of features between the local representation space and the
common representation space is achieved by a pair of sender and receiver. To
better align local representations to the common representation containing
multimodal information, we introduce structural alignment loss and pragmatic
alignment loss in addition to the distribution alignment loss to supervise the
training. This enables the knowledge in the common representation to be fully
distilled into the sender.

Motivation: 现有检测器使用IoU作为相似度度量对小目标检测效果差，而Wasserstein距离缺乏尺度不变性且优化效率低，需要更好的相似度度量方法。

Method: 提出高斯组合距离(GCD)，通过分析GCD及其梯度特性，证明其具有尺度不变性和联合优化能力，可作为边界框回归损失函数和标签分配度量。

Result: 在AI-TOD-v2小目标检测数据集上达到SOTA性能，在MS-COCO-2017和Visdrone-2019数据集上验证了GCD的泛化能力，优于Wasserstein距离。

Conclusion: GCD作为边界框相似度度量方法，解决了现有方法的局限性，在多种检测器和数据集上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: In object detection, a well-defined similarity metric can significantly
enhance model performance. Currently, the IoU-based similarity metric is the
most commonly preferred choice for detectors. However, detectors using IoU as a
similarity metric often perform poorly when detecting small objects because of
their sensitivity to minor positional deviations. To address this issue, recent
studies have proposed the Wasserstein Distance as an alternative to IoU for
measuring the similarity of Gaussian-distributed bounding boxes. However, we
have observed that the Wasserstein Distance lacks scale invariance, which
negatively impacts the model's generalization capability. Additionally, when
used as a loss function, its independent optimization of the center attributes
leads to slow model convergence and unsatisfactory detection precision. To
address these challenges, we introduce the Gaussian Combined Distance (GCD).
Through analytical examination of GCD and its gradient, we demonstrate that GCD
not only possesses scale invariance but also facilitates joint optimization,
which enhances model localization performance. Extensive experiments on the
AI-TOD-v2 dataset for tiny object detection show that GCD, as a bounding box
regression loss function and label assignment metric, achieves state-of-the-art
performance across various detectors. We further validated the generalizability
of GCD on the MS-COCO-2017 and Visdrone-2019 datasets, where it outperforms the
Wasserstein Distance across diverse scales of datasets. Code is available at

Conclusion: 深度去噪是一种强大且模态无关的增强技术，能够推进定量操作成像，并扩展先前受噪声限制技术的应用范围。

Abstract: Operando microscopy provides direct insight into the dynamic chemical and
physical processes that govern functional materials, yet measurement noise
limits the effective resolution and undermines quantitative analysis. Here, we
present a general framework for integrating unsupervised deep learning-based
denoising into quantitative microscopy workflows across modalities and length
scales. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that deep denoising preserves
physical fidelity, introduces minimal bias, and reduces uncertainty in model
learning with partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization.
Applied to experiments, denoising reveals nanoscale chemical and structural
heterogeneity in scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) of lithium iron
phosphate (LFP), enables automated particle segmentation and phase
classification in optical microscopy of graphite electrodes, and reduces
noise-induced variability by nearly 80% in neutron radiography to resolve
heterogeneous lithium transport. Collectively, these results establish deep
denoising as a powerful, modality-agnostic enhancement that advances
quantitative operando imaging and extends the reach of previously noise-limited
techniques.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) in surveillance is challenged by occlusion,
viewpoint distortion, and poor image quality. Most existing methods rely on
complex modules or perform well only on clear frontal images. We propose Sh-ViT
(Shuffling Vision Transformer), a lightweight and robust model for occluded
person ReID. Built on ViT-Base, Sh-ViT introduces three components: First, a
Shuffle module in the final Transformer layer to break spatial correlations and
enhance robustness to occlusion and blur; Second, scenario-adapted augmentation
(geometric transforms, erasing, blur, and color adjustment) to simulate
surveillance conditions; Third, DeiT-based knowledge distillation to improve
learning with limited labels.To support real-world evaluation, we construct the
MyTT dataset, containing over 10,000 pedestrians and 30,000+ images from base
station inspections, with frequent equipment occlusion and camera variations.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive
multimodal reasoning, yet most medical applications remain limited to 2D
imaging. In this work, we extend VLMs to 3D positron emission tomography and
computed tomography (PET/CT), a domain characterized by large volumetric data,
small and dispersed lesions, and lengthy radiology reports. We introduce a
large-scale dataset comprising over 11,000 lesion-level descriptions paired
with 3D segmentations from more than 5,000 PET/CT exams, extracted via a hybrid
rule-based and large language model (LLM) pipeline. Building upon this dataset,
we propose PETAR-4B, a 3D mask-aware vision-language model that integrates PET,
CT, and lesion contours for spatially grounded report generation. PETAR bridges
global contextual reasoning with fine-grained lesion awareness, producing
clinically coherent and localized findings. Comprehensive automated and human
evaluations demonstrate that PETAR substantially improves PET/CT report
generation quality, advancing 3D medical vision-language understanding.

TL;DR: Phased DMD是一种多步蒸馏框架，结合了分阶段蒸馏和专家混合(MoE)思想，解决了传统DMD在复杂生成任务中模型容量不足和多样性下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD)在复杂生成任务中表现不佳，而直接扩展到多步蒸馏会导致内存使用增加、计算深度加深、不稳定性和效率降低。随机梯度截断虽然是一种解决方案，但会显著降低多步蒸馏模型的生成多样性。

Method: Phased DMD基于两个关键思想：渐进分布匹配和子区间内的分数匹配。首先将SNR范围划分为子区间，逐步将模型精炼到更高的SNR水平以更好地捕捉复杂分布。其次，通过严格的数学推导确保每个子区间内的训练目标准确。

Result: 实验验证了Phased DMD在蒸馏最先进的图像和视频生成模型（包括Qwen-Image和Wan2.2）时的有效性。结果表明，Phased DMD在保留关键生成能力的同时，比DMD更好地保持了输出多样性。

Conclusion: Phased DMD通过分阶段蒸馏和MoE的结合，成功解决了多步蒸馏中的容量限制和多样性下降问题，为复杂生成任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) distills score-based generative
models into efficient one-step generators, without requiring a one-to-one
correspondence with the sampling trajectories of their teachers. However,
limited model capacity causes one-step distilled models underperform on complex
generative tasks, e.g., synthesizing intricate object motions in text-to-video
generation. Directly extending DMD to multi-step distillation increases memory
usage and computational depth, leading to instability and reduced efficiency.
While prior works propose stochastic gradient truncation as a potential
solution, we observe that it substantially reduces the generation diversity of
multi-step distilled models, bringing it down to the level of their one-step
counterparts. To address these limitations, we propose Phased DMD, a multi-step
distillation framework that bridges the idea of phase-wise distillation with
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), reducing learning difficulty while enhancing model
capacity. Phased DMD is built upon two key ideas: progressive distribution
matching and score matching within subintervals. First, our model divides the
SNR range into subintervals, progressively refining the model to higher SNR
levels, to better capture complex distributions. Next, to ensure the training
objective within each subinterval is accurate, we have conducted rigorous
mathematical derivations. We validate Phased DMD by distilling state-of-the-art
image and video generation models, including Qwen-Image (20B parameters) and
Wan2.2 (28B parameters). Experimental results demonstrate that Phased DMD
preserves output diversity better than DMD while retaining key generative
capabilities. We will release our code and models.

Abstract: Non-contact electrocardiogram (ECG) reconstruction from radar signals offers
a promising approach for unobtrusive cardiac monitoring. We present LifWavNet,
a lifting wavelet network based on a multi-resolution analysis and synthesis
(MRAS) model for radar-to-ECG reconstruction. Unlike prior models that use
fixed wavelet approaches, LifWavNet employs learnable lifting wavelets with
lifting and inverse lifting units to adaptively capture radar signal features
and synthesize physiologically meaningful ECG waveforms. To improve
reconstruction fidelity, we introduce a multi-resolution short-time Fourier
transform (STFT) loss, that enforces consistency with the ground-truth ECG in
both temporal and spectral domains. Evaluations on two public datasets
demonstrate that LifWavNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in ECG
reconstruction and downstream vital sign estimation (heart rate and heart rate
variability). Furthermore, intermediate feature visualization highlights the
interpretability of multi-resolution decomposition and synthesis in
radar-to-ECG reconstruction. These results establish LifWavNet as a robust
framework for radar-based non-contact ECG measurement.
