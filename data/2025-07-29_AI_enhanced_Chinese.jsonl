Recent approaches have\nattempted to construct long contexts for instruction tuning, but these methods\noften require LLMs or human interventions, which are both costly and limited in\nlength and diversity. Also, the drop in short-context performances of present\nlong-context LLMs remains significant. In this paper, we introduce Flora, an\neffortless (human/LLM-free) long-context construction strategy.

However, the roles of existing\ndecoder query types (e.g., content query and positional query) are still\nunderexplored. These queries are generally predefined with a fixed number\n(fixed-query), which limits their flexibility. We find that the learning of\nthese fixed-query is impaired by Recurrent Opposing inTeractions (ROT) between\ntwo attention operations: Self-Attention (query-to-query) and Cross-Attention\n(query-to-encoder), thereby degrading decoder efficiency. Furthermore, \"query\nambiguity\" arises when shared-weight decoder layers are processed with both\none-to-one and one-to-many label assignments during training, violating DETR's\none-to-one matching principle. To address these challenges, we propose DS-Det,\na more efficient detector capable of detecting a flexible number of objects in\nimages.

However, the current landscape supports\nonly a limited set of certifiers, and developing new ones or modifying existing\nones for different applications remains difficult. This is because the\nmathematical design of certifiers is expressed at the neuron level, while their\nimplementations are optimized and executed at the tensor level. This mismatch\ncreates a semantic gap between design and implementation, making manual\nbridging both complex and expertise-intensive -- requiring deep knowledge in\nformal methods, high-performance computing, etc.\n  We propose a compiler framework that automatically translates neuron-level\nspecifications of DNN certifiers into tensor-based, layer-level\nimplementations. This is enabled by two key innovations: a novel stack-based\nintermediate representation (IR) and a shape analysis that infers the implicit\ntensor operations needed to simulate the neuron-level semantics. During\nlifting, the shape analysis creates tensors in the minimal shape required to\nperform the corresponding operations. The IR also enables domain-specific\noptimizations as rewrites.

Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR)\nmethods rely on multi-stage pipelines that first extract visual features, then\nalign variable-length sequences with target glosses using CTC or HMM-based\napproaches.

To overcome this, we propose ProsodyLM, which\nintroduces a simple tokenization scheme amenable to learning prosody. Each\nspeech utterance is first transcribed into text, followed by a sequence of\nword-level prosody tokens. Compared with conventional speech tokenization\nschemes, the proposed tokenization scheme retains more complete prosody\ninformation, and is more understandable to text-based LLMs. We find that\nProsodyLM can learn surprisingly diverse emerging prosody processing\ncapabilities through pre-training alone, ranging from harnessing the prosody\nnuances in generated speech, such as contrastive focus, understanding emotion\nand stress in an utterance, to maintaining prosody consistency in long\ncontexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faProsodyLM\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u65b9\u6848\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5b66\u4e60\u97f5\u5f8b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u97f5\u5f8b\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e3b\u6d41\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c06\u8bed\u97f3\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u6807\u8bb0\u540e\u8f93\u5165LLMs\u65f6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u97f5\u5f8b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u65e0\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u660e\u663e\u7684\u97f5\u5f8b\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faProsodyLM\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u65b9\u6848\uff1a\u5148\u5c06\u8bed\u97f3\u8f6c\u5f55\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u518d\u751f\u6210\u8bcd\u7ea7\u97f5\u5f8b\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u66f4\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u97f5\u5f8b\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u4fbf\u4e8e\u6587\u672cLLMs\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "result": "ProsodyLM\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c31\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u97f5\u5f8b\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u97f3\u4e2d\u7684\u97f5\u5f8b\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u522b\uff08\u5982\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7126\u70b9\uff09\u3001\u7406\u89e3\u60c5\u611f\u548c\u91cd\u97f3\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4fdd\u6301\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u97f5\u5f8b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ProsodyLM\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u97f5\u5f8b\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bed\u97f3\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

Although negative prompt tuning has enhanced the OOD detection\ncapabilities of vision-language models, these tuned models often suffer from\nreduced generalization performance on unseen classes and styles. To address\nthis challenge, we propose a novel method called Knowledge Regularized Negative\nFeature Tuning (KR-NFT), which integrates an innovative adaptation architecture\ntermed Negative Feature Tuning (NFT) and a corresponding\nknowledge-regularization (KR) optimization strategy. Specifically, NFT applies\ndistribution-aware transformations to pre-trained text features, effectively\nseparating positive and negative features into distinct spaces. This separation\nmaximizes the distinction between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images.\nAdditionally, we introduce image-conditional learnable factors through a\nlightweight meta-network, enabling dynamic adaptation to individual images and\nmitigating sensitivity to class and style shifts. Compared to traditional\nnegative prompt tuning, NFT demonstrates superior efficiency and scalability.\nTo optimize this adaptation architecture, the KR optimization strategy is\ndesigned to enhance the discrimination between ID and OOD sets while mitigating\npre-trained knowledge forgetting. This enhances OOD detection performance on\ntrained ID classes while simultaneously improving OOD detection on unseen ID\ndatasets. Notably, when trained with few-shot samples from ImageNet dataset,\nKR-NFT not only improves ID classification accuracy and OOD detection but also\nsignificantly reduces the FPR95 by 5.44\\% under an unexplored generalization\nsetting with unseen ID categories.

Existing fusion approaches typically rely on either\ninstance-based proposals or dense BEV grids, which either lack holistic scene\nunderstanding or are limited by rigid grid structures. To address these, we\npropose RaGS, the first framework to leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) as\nrepresentation for fusing 4D radar and monocular cues in 3D object detection.\n3D GS naturally suits 3D object detection by modeling the scene as a field of\nGaussians, dynamically allocating resources on foreground objects and providing\na flexible, resource-efficient solution. RaGS uses a cascaded pipeline to\nconstruct and refine the Gaussian field. It starts with the Frustum-based\nLocalization Initiation (FLI), which unprojects foreground pixels to initialize\ncoarse 3D Gaussians positions. Then, the Iterative Multimodal Aggregation (IMA)\nfuses semantics and geometry, refining the limited Gaussians to the regions of\ninterest. Finally, the Multi-level Gaussian Fusion (MGF) renders the Gaussians\ninto multi-level BEV features for 3D object detection. By dynamically focusing\non sparse objects within scenes, RaGS enable object concentrating while\noffering comprehensive scene perception.

To meet the data requirements for the training\nmethodology, we propose dual-modal data refinement methods that leverage large\nlanguage models and cross-modal similarity for data generation and filtering.\nSimultaneously, we develope a visualization interface that enables users to\nexplore and deliver high-quality annotations: including class-specific visual\nfeature phrases and fine-grained differentiated images. Quantitative evaluation\ndemonstrates that OW-CLIP achieves competitive performance at 89% of\nstate-of-the-art performance while requiring only 3.8% self-generated data,\nwhile outperforming SOTA approach when trained with equivalent data volumes.

With 1,952,177 intention\nentries, 1,132,145 session intention trajectories, and 13,003,664 available\ntasks mined using 10,905 sessions, we provide a scalable way to exploit the\nexisting session data for customer intention understanding. We conduct human\nannotations to collect ground-truth label for a subset of collected data to\nform an evaluation gold set. Extensive experiments on the annotated data\nfurther confirm that current L(V)LMs fail to capture and utilize the intention\nacross the complex session setting. Further analysis show injecting intention\nenhances LLMs' performances.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u610f\u56fe\u6811\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u4e86SessionIntentBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u4f1a\u8bdd\u95f4\u610f\u56fe\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6ce8\u5165\u610f\u56fe\u4fe1\u606f\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u548c\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6570\u636e\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u610f\u56fe\u6811\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u521b\u5efaSessionIntentBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u5927\u91cf\u610f\u56fe\u6761\u76ee\u548c\u4f1a\u8bdd\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4f1a\u8bdd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u610f\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u610f\u56fe\u6ce8\u5165\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0cSessionIntentBench\u4e3a\u610f\u56fe\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose\nMambaVesselNet++, a Hybrid CNN-Mamba framework for medical image segmentation.\nOur MambaVesselNet++ is comprised of a hybrid image encoder (Hi-Encoder) and a\nbifocal fusion decoder (BF-Decoder). In Hi-Encoder, we first devise the\ntexture-aware layer to capture low-level semantic features by leveraging\nconvolutions. Then, we utilize Mamba to effectively model long-range\ndependencies with linear complexity. The Bi-Decoder adopts skip connections to\ncombine local and global information of the Hi-Encoder for the accurate\ngeneration of segmentation masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nMambaVesselNet++ outperforms current convolution-based, transformer-based, and\nMamba-based state-of-the-arts across diverse medical 2D, 3D, and instance\nsegmentation tasks.

However, its patch\ntokenization and 1D serialization disrupt local pixel adjacency and impose a\nlow-pass filtering effect, resulting in Local High-frequency Information\nCapture Deficiency (LHICD) and two-dimensional Spatial Structure Degradation\n(2D-SSD), which in turn exacerbate LBA and LHD. In this work, we propose\nFaRMamba, a novel extension that explicitly addresses LHICD and 2D-SSD through\ntwo complementary modules. A Multi-Scale Frequency Transform Module (MSFM)\nrestores attenuated high-frequency cues by isolating and reconstructing\nmulti-band spectra via wavelet, cosine, and Fourier transforms. A\nSelf-Supervised Reconstruction Auxiliary Encoder (SSRAE) enforces pixel-level\nreconstruction on the shared Mamba encoder to recover full 2D spatial\ncorrelations, enhancing both fine textures and global context. Extensive\nevaluations on CAMUS echocardiography, MRI-based Mouse-cochlea, and Kvasir-Seg\nendoscopy demonstrate that FaRMamba consistently outperforms competitive\nCNN-Transformer hybrids and existing Mamba variants, delivering superior\nboundary accuracy, detail preservation, and global coherence without\nprohibitive computational overhead.

Medial epicondyle avulsion, commonly observed in baseball players,\ninvolves bone detachment and deformity, often appearing as discontinuities in\nbone contour. Therefore, learning the structure and continuity of normal bone\nis essential for detecting such abnormalities. To achieve this, we propose a\nmasked autoencoder-based, structure-aware reconstruction framework that learns\nthe continuity of normal bone structures. Even in the presence of avulsion, the\nmodel attempts to reconstruct the normal structure, resulting in large\nreconstruction errors at the avulsion site.

Current parameter reduction\ntechniques primarily involve training MLLMs from Small Language Models (SLMs),\nbut these methods offer limited flexibility and remain computationally\nintensive. To address this gap, we propose to directly compress existing MLLMs\nthrough structural pruning combined with efficient recovery training.\nSpecifically, we investigate two structural pruning paradigms--layerwise and\nwidthwise pruning--applied to the language model backbone of MLLMs, alongside\nsupervised finetuning and knowledge distillation. Additionally, we assess the\nfeasibility of conducting recovery training with only a small fraction of the\navailable data. Our results show that widthwise pruning generally maintains\nbetter performance in low-resource scenarios with limited computational\nresources or insufficient finetuning data.

Although some methods\nintegrate extra information to generate identity-aware descriptions, the player\nidentities are sometimes incorrect because the extra information is independent\nof the video content. This paper proposes a player-centric multimodal prompt\ngeneration network for identity-aware sports video captioning (LLM-IAVC), which\nfocuses on recognizing player identities from a visual perspective.\nSpecifically, an identity-related information extraction module (IRIEM) is\ndesigned to extract player-related multimodal embeddings. IRIEM includes a\nplayer identification network (PIN) for extracting visual features and player\nnames, and a bidirectional semantic interaction module (BSIM) to link player\nfeatures with video content for mutual enhancement. Additionally, a visual\ncontext learning module (VCLM) is designed to capture the key video context\ninformation. Finally, by integrating the outputs of the above modules as the\nmultimodal prompt for the large language model (LLM), it facilitates the\ngeneration of descriptions with player identities. To support this work, we\nconstruct a new benchmark called NBA-Identity, a large identity-aware\nbasketball video captioning dataset with 9,726 videos covering 9 major event\ntypes.

In this work, we propose Soft Injection of task\nembeddings. The task embeddings are constructed only once using few-shot ICL\nprompts and repeatedly used during inference. Soft injection is performed by\nsoftly mixing task embeddings with attention head activations using\npre-optimized mixing parameters, referred to as soft head-selection parameters.\nThis method not only allows a desired task to be performed without in-prompt\ndemonstrations but also significantly outperforms existing ICL approaches while\nreducing memory usage and compute cost at inference time. An extensive\nevaluation is performed across 57 tasks and 12 LLMs, spanning four model\nfamilies of sizes from 4B to 70B. Averaged across 57 tasks, our method\noutperforms 10-shot ICL by 10.1%-13.9% across 12 LLMs. Additional analyses show\nthat our method also serves as an insightful tool for analyzing task-relevant\nroles of attention heads, revealing that task-relevant head positions selected\nby our method transfer across similar tasks but not across dissimilar ones --\nunderscoring the task-specific nature of head functionality. Our soft injection\nmethod opens a new paradigm for reducing prompt length and improving task\nperformance by shifting task conditioning from the prompt space to the\nactivation space.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6f\u6ce8\u5165\u4efb\u52a1\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u63d0\u793a\u957f\u5ea6\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u793a\u4f8b\u63d0\u793a\u7684ICL\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u793a\u4f8b\u63d0\u793a\u662f\u5426\u662f\u6700\u6709\u6548\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u4f18\u7684ICL\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6f\u6ce8\u5165\u4efb\u52a1\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u4fe1\u606f\u4ece\u63d0\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u572857\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c12\u4e2aLLMs\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e10-shot ICL 10.1%-13.9%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f6f\u6ce8\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u51cf\u5c11\u63d0\u793a\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u3002"}}

To\nhelp address this issue, the fifth Sexism Identification in Social Networks\n(EXIST) challenge is initiated at CLEF 2025. Among this year's international\nbenchmarks, we concentrate on solving the first task aiming to identify and\nclassify sexism in social media textual posts. In this paper, we describe our\nsolutions and report results for three subtasks: Subtask 1.1 - Sexism\nIdentification in Tweets, Subtask 1.2 - Source Intention in Tweets, and Subtask\n1.3 - Sexism Categorization in Tweets. We implement three models to address\neach subtask which constitute three individual runs: Speech Concept Bottleneck\nModel (SCBM), Speech Concept Bottleneck Model with Transformer (SCBMT), and a\nfine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa transformer model. SCBM uses descriptive adjectives as\nhuman-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models\n(LLMs) to encode input texts into a human-interpretable representation of\nadjectives, then used to train a lightweight classifier for downstream tasks.\nSCBMT extends SCBM by fusing adjective-based representation with contextual\nembeddings from transformers to balance interpretability and classification\nperformance. Beyond competitive results, these two models offer fine-grained\nexplanations at both instance (local) and class (global) levels.

To this end, we propose a dynamic multi-level image fusion\nnetwork called MoCTEFuse, which applies an illumination-gated Mixture of Chiral\nTransformer Experts (MoCTE) to adaptively preserve texture details and object\ncontrasts in balance. MoCTE consists of high- and low-illumination expert\nsubnetworks, each built upon the Chiral Transformer Fusion Block (CTFB).

The Segment Anything Model (SAM), a leading model for image\nsegmentation, exemplifies these advances, outperforming traditional methods.\nHowever, such foundation models often suffer from performance degradation when\napplied to complex tasks for which they are not trained. Existing methods\ntypically employ adapter-based fine-tuning strategies to adapt SAM for tasks\nand leverage high-frequency features extracted from the Fourier domain.\nHowever, Our analysis reveals that these approaches offer limited benefits due\nto constraints in their feature extraction techniques.

Extensive experiments on\nchallenging benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach,\nachieving state-of-the-art performance with F-scores of 84.8% on the benchmark\nmulti-lingual MLT-2019 dataset and 90.2% on the curved-text CTW1500 dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "SAViL-Det\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u811a\u672c\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u7136\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u6d4b\u9762\u4e34\u591a\u6837\u811a\u672c\u548c\u4efb\u610f\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u548cAFPN\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8bed\u8a00-\u89c6\u89c9\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4f20\u64ad\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u6587\u672c-\u50cf\u7d20\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728MLT-2019\u548cCTW1500\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523084.8%\u548c90.2%\u7684F-score\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "SAViL-Det\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u811a\u672c\u548c\u5f2f\u66f2\u6587\u672c\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While this ability significantly enhances MLLM capabilities, it\nintroduces substantial computational challenges, primarily due to the quadratic\ncomplexity of self-attention mechanisms with numerous input tokens. To mitigate\nthese bottlenecks, token compression has emerged as an auspicious and critical\napproach, efficiently reducing the number of tokens during both training and\ninference. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey and synthesis\nof the burgeoning field of multimodal long context token compression.\nRecognizing that effective compression strategies are deeply tied to the unique\ncharacteristics and redundancies of each modality, we categorize existing\napproaches by their primary data focus, enabling researchers to quickly access\nand learn methods tailored to their specific area of interest: (1)\nimage-centric compression, which addresses spatial redundancy in visual data;\n(2) video-centric compression, which tackles spatio-temporal redundancy in\ndynamic sequences; and (3) audio-centric compression, which handles temporal\nand spectral redundancy in acoustic signals.

This study\nfuses multi-source data to construct a multi-modal mine land cover scene\nclassification dataset. A significant challenge in mining area classification\nlies in the complex spatial layout and multi-scale characteristics. By\nextracting global and local features, it becomes possible to comprehensively\nreflect the spatial distribution, thereby enabling a more accurate capture of\nthe holistic characteristics of mining scenes. We propose a dual-branch fusion\nmodel utilizing collaborative representation to decompose global features into\na set of key semantic vectors. This model comprises three key components:(1)\nMulti-scale Global Transformer Branch: It leverages adjacent large-scale\nfeatures to generate global channel attention features for small-scale\nfeatures, effectively capturing the multi-scale feature relationships. (2)\nLocal Enhancement Collaborative Representation Branch: It refines the attention\nweights by leveraging local features and reconstructed key semantic sets,\nensuring that the local context and detailed characteristics of the mining area\nare effectively integrated. This enhances the model's sensitivity to\nfine-grained spatial variations. (3) Dual-Branch Deep Feature Fusion Module: It\nfuses the complementary features of the two branches to incorporate more scene\ninformation. This fusion strengthens the model's ability to distinguish and\nclassify complex mining landscapes.

MIRepNet comprises a high-quality EEG\npreprocessing pipeline incorporating a neurophysiologically-informed channel\ntemplate, adaptable to EEG headsets with arbitrary electrode configurations.\nFurthermore, we introduce a hybrid pretraining strategy that combines\nself-supervised masked token reconstruction and supervised MI classification,\nfacilitating rapid adaptation and accurate decoding on novel downstream MI\ntasks with fewer than 30 trials per class. Extensive evaluations across five\npublic MI datasets demonstrated that MIRepNet consistently achieved\nstate-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming both specialized and\ngeneralized EEG models.

However, one\ncritical issue of such methods lies in their poor reconstruction of image fine\nstructures, such as small characters and textures, due to the aggressive\nresolution reduction of the VAE (eg., 8$\\times$ downsampling) in the SD model.\nOne solution is to employ a VAE with a lower downsampling rate for diffusion;\nhowever, adapting its latent features with the pre-trained UNet while\nmitigating the increased computational cost poses new challenges. To address\nthese issues, we propose a Transfer VAE Training (TVT) strategy to transfer the\n8$\\times$ downsampled VAE into a 4$\\times$ one while adapting to the\npre-trained UNet. Specifically, we first train a 4$\\times$ decoder based on the\noutput features of the original VAE encoder, then train a 4$\\times$ encoder\nwhile keeping the newly trained decoder fixed. Such a TVT strategy aligns the\nnew encoder-decoder pair with the original VAE latent space while enhancing\nimage fine details. Additionally, we introduce a compact VAE and\ncompute-efficient UNet by optimizing their network architectures, reducing the\ncomputational cost while capturing high-resolution fine-scale features.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our TVT method significantly improves\nfine-structure preservation, which is often compromised by other SD-based\nmethods, while requiring fewer FLOPs than state-of-the-art one-step diffusion\nmodels.

Achieving both temporal consistency, or realistic lighting remains\ndifficult, particularly in dynamic scenarios with complex object motion,\nperspective changes, and varying illumination. While 2D diffusion models have\nshown promise for producing photorealistic edits, they often struggle with\nmaintaining temporal coherence across frames. Conversely, traditional 3D\nrendering methods excel in spatial and temporal consistency but fall short in\nachieving photorealistic lighting. In this work, we propose a hybrid object\ninsertion pipeline that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Specifically,\nwe focus on inserting bracelets into dynamic wrist scenes, leveraging the high\ntemporal consistency of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for initial rendering and\nrefining the results using a 2D diffusion-based enhancement model to ensure\nrealistic lighting interactions. Our method introduces a shading-driven\npipeline that separates intrinsic object properties (albedo, shading,\nreflectance) and refines both shading and sRGB images for photorealism. To\nmaintain temporal coherence, we optimize the 3DGS model with multi-frame\nweighted adjustments. This is the first approach to synergize 3D rendering and\n2D diffusion for video object insertion, offering a robust solution for\nrealistic and consistent video editing.

It generates images by\nprogressively refining resolution across multiple stages. However, the\ncomputational overhead in high-resolution stages remains a critical challenge\ndue to the substantial number of tokens involved. In this paper, we introduce\nSparseVAR, a plug-and-play acceleration framework for next-scale prediction\nthat dynamically excludes low-frequency tokens during inference without\nrequiring additional training. Our approach is motivated by the observation\nthat tokens in low-frequency regions have a negligible impact on image quality\nin high-resolution stages and exhibit strong similarity with neighboring\ntokens. Additionally, we observe that different blocks in the next-scale\nprediction model focus on distinct regions, with some concentrating on\nhigh-frequency areas.

To this end, we proposed a novel Few-Shot Learning (FSL) method\n(BCT-CLIP) that explores \\textbf{dominating properties} via contrastive\nlearning beyond simply using class tokens. Through leveraging LLM-based prior\nknowledge, our method pushes forward FSL with comprehensive structural image\nrepresentations, including both global category representation and the\npatch-aware property embeddings. In particular, we presented a novel\nmulti-property generator (MPG) with patch-aware cross-attentions to generate\nmultiple visual property tokens, a Large-Language Model (LLM)-assistant\nretrieval procedure with clustering-based pruning to obtain dominating property\ndescriptions, and a new contrastive learning strategy for property-token\nlearning. The superior performances on the 11 widely used datasets demonstrate\nthat our investigation of dominating properties advances discriminative\nclass-specific representation learning and few-shot classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "BCT-CLIP\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u63a2\u7d22\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u7b80\u5355\u5bf9\u9f50\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u548c\u7c7b\u540d\u5d4c\u5165\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u591a\u6837\u6027\u635f\u5931\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u5c5e\u6027\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff08MPG\uff09\u3001LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u65b0\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5168\u5c40\u7c7b\u522b\u8868\u793a\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u5c5e\u6027\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u572811\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5c5e\u6027\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "BCT-CLIP\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While\ntechniques such as automatic prompt engineering, controlled text embeddings,\ndenoising, and multi-turn generation mitigate these issues, they offer limited\ncontrollability, or often necessitate additional training, restricting the\ngeneralization abilities. Thus, we introduce T2I-Copilot, a training-free\nmulti-agent system that leverages collaboration between (Multimodal) Large\nLanguage Models to automate prompt phrasing, model selection, and iterative\nrefinement. This approach significantly simplifies prompt engineering while\nenhancing generation quality and text-image alignment compared to direct\ngeneration. Specifically, T2I-Copilot consists of three agents: (1) Input\nInterpreter, which parses the input prompt, resolves ambiguities, and generates\na standardized report; (2) Generation Engine, which selects the appropriate\nmodel from different types of T2I models and organizes visual and textual\nprompts to initiate generation; and (3) Quality Evaluator, which assesses\naesthetic quality and text-image alignment, providing scores and feedback for\npotential regeneration. T2I-Copilot can operate fully autonomously while also\nsupporting human-in-the-loop intervention for fine-grained control.

This paper recognises this very problem and\nstudies sketch quality assessment for the first time -- letting you find these\nbadly drawn ones. Our key discovery lies in exploiting the magnitude ($L_2$\nnorm) of a sketch feature as a quantitative quality metric. We propose\nGeometry-Aware Classification Layer (GACL), a generic method that makes\nfeature-magnitude-as-quality-metric possible and importantly does it without\nthe need for specific quality annotations from humans. GACL sees feature\nmagnitude and recognisability learning as a dual task, which can be\nsimultaneously optimised under a neat cross-entropy classification loss with\ntheoretic guarantee. This gives GACL a nice geometric interpretation (the\nbetter the quality, the easier the recognition), and makes it agnostic to both\nnetwork architecture changes and the underlying sketch representation. Through\na large scale human study of 160,000 \\doublecheck{trials}, we confirm the\nagreement between our GACL-induced metric and human quality perception. We\nfurther demonstrate how such a quality assessment capability can for the first\ntime enable three practical sketch applications.

They could reveal genuine emotions individuals may attempt to\nconceal, valuable in contexts like criminal interrogation and psychological\ncounseling. However, ME recognition (MER) faces challenges, such as small\nsample sizes and subtle features, which hinder efficient modeling.\nAdditionally, real-world applications encounter ME data privacy issues, leaving\nthe task of enhancing recognition across settings under privacy constraints\nlargely unexplored. To address these issues, we propose a FED-PsyAU research\nframework.

The spatially sequential arrangement of adjacent MRI slices provides\nvaluable information that enhances segmentation continuity and accuracy, yet\nthis characteristic remains underutilized in many existing models. The spatial\ncorrelations between adjacent MRI slices can be regarded as \"temporal-like\"\ndata, similar to frame sequences in video segmentation tasks. To bridge this\ngap, we propose M-Net, a flexible framework specifically designed for\nsequential image segmentation. M-Net introduces the novel Mesh-Cast mechanism,\nwhich seamlessly integrates arbitrary sequential models into the processing of\nboth channel and temporal information, thereby systematically capturing the\ninherent \"temporal-like\" spatial correlations between MRI slices.

The key challenge\nlies in identifying which tokens are truly important. Most existing approaches\nrely on attention-based criteria to estimate token importance. However, they\ninherently suffer from certain limitations, such as positional bias. In this\nwork, we explore a new perspective on token importance based on token\ntransitions in LVLMs. We observe that the transition of token representations\nprovides a meaningful signal of semantic information. Based on this insight, we\npropose TransPrune, a training-free and efficient token pruning method.\nSpecifically, TransPrune progressively prunes tokens by assessing their\nimportance through a combination of Token Transition Variation (TTV)-which\nmeasures changes in both the magnitude and direction of token\nrepresentations-and Instruction-Guided Attention (IGA), which measures how\nstrongly the instruction attends to image tokens via attention. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that TransPrune achieves comparable multimodal\nperformance to original LVLMs, such as LLaVA-v1.5 and LLaVA-Next, across eight\nbenchmarks, while reducing inference TFLOPs by more than half. Moreover, TTV\nalone can serve as an effective criterion without relying on attention,\nachieving performance comparable to attention-based methods.

Despite progress in same-domain composition, cross-domain\ncomposition remains under-explored. The main challenges are the stochastic\nnature of diffusion models and the style gap between input images, leading to\nfailures and artifacts. Additionally, heavy reliance on text prompts limits\npractical applications. This paper presents the first cross-domain image\ncomposition method that does not require text prompts, allowing natural\nstylization and seamless compositions. Our method is efficient and robust,\npreserving the diffusion prior, as it involves minor steps for backward\ninversion and forward denoising without training the diffuser. Our method also\nuses a simple multilayer perceptron network to integrate CLIP features from\nforeground and background, manipulating diffusion with a local cross-attention\nstrategy. It effectively preserves foreground content while enabling stable\nstylization without a pre-stylization network. Finally, we create a benchmark\ndataset with diverse contents and styles for fair evaluation, addressing the\nlack of testing datasets for cross-domain image composition. Our method\noutperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative\nevaluations, significantly improving the LPIPS score by 30.5% and the CSD\nmetric by 18.1%.

Subsequent investigations into\nenhancing their visual reasoning abilities have significantly expanded their\nperformance envelope. However, a critical bottleneck in the advancement of\nMLLMs toward deep visual reasoning is their heavy reliance on curated\nimage-text supervision. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel framework\ntermed ``Reasoning-Rendering-Visual-Feedback'' (RRVF), which enables MLLMs to\nlearn complex visual reasoning from only raw images. This framework builds on\nthe ``Asymmetry of Verification'' principle to train MLLMs, i.e., verifying the\nrendered output against a source image is easier than generating it. We\ndemonstrate that this relative ease provides an ideal reward signal for\noptimization via Reinforcement Learning (RL) training, reducing the reliance on\nthe image-text supervision. Guided by the above principle, RRVF implements a\nclosed-loop iterative process encompassing reasoning, rendering, and visual\nfeedback components, enabling the model to perform self-correction through\nmulti-turn interactions and tool invocation, while this pipeline can be\noptimized by the GRPO algorithm in an end-to-end manner.

Recent progress in self-supervised\nrepresentation learning has led to some success in UOD algorithms. However, the\nabsence of ground truth provides existing UOD methods with two challenges: 1)\ndetermining if a discovered region is foreground or background, and 2) knowing\nhow many objects remain undiscovered. To address these two problems, previous\nsolutions rely on foreground priors to distinguish if the discovered region is\nforeground, and conduct one or fixed iterations of discovery. However, the\nexisting foreground priors are heuristic and not always robust, and a fixed\nnumber of discoveries leads to under or over-segmentation, since the number of\nobjects in images varies. This paper introduces UnionCut, a robust and\nwell-grounded foreground prior based on min-cut and ensemble methods that\ndetects the union of foreground areas of an image, allowing UOD algorithms to\nidentify foreground objects and stop discovery once the majority of the\nforeground union in the image is segmented. In addition, we propose UnionSeg, a\ndistilled transformer of UnionCut that outputs the foreground union more\nefficiently and accurately. Our experiments show that by combining with\nUnionCut or UnionSeg, previous state-of-the-art UOD methods witness an increase\nin the performance of single object discovery, saliency detection and\nself-supervised instance segmentation on various benchmarks.

Traditional\nimage-based de-snowing methods often introduce hallucination artifacts as they\nrely solely on spatial information, while video-based approaches require high\nframe rates and suffer from alignment artifacts at lower frame rates. Camera\nparameters, such as exposure time, also influence the appearance of snowflakes,\nmaking the problem difficult to solve and heavily dependent on network\ngeneralization. In this paper, we propose to address the challenge of desnowing\nby using event cameras, which offer compressed visual information with\nsubmillisecond latency, making them ideal for de-snowing images, even in the\npresence of ego-motion. Our method leverages the fact that snowflake occlusions\nappear with a very distinctive streak signature in the spatio-temporal\nrepresentation of event data.

One drawback of QBE searches is that they require\nsample query documents on hand that may not be available. ABDIR aims to offer\nusers a flexible way to retrieve document images based on memorable visual\nfeatures of document contents, describing document images with combinations of\nvisual attributes determined via convolutional neural network (CNN)-based\nbinary classifiers. We present an exploratory study of the use of generative AI\nto bridge the gap between QBE and ABDIR, focusing on historical documents as a\nuse case for their diversity and uniqueness in visual features. We hypothesize\nthat text-to-image (T2I) generation can be leveraged to create query document\nimages using text prompts based on ABDIR-like attributes.

Furthermore, we introduce two newly annotated aerial\ndatasets from New Zealand and Utah to support further research in this field.\nProject page is available at: https://humansensinglab.github.io/AGenDA", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5408\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u822a\u62cd\u56fe\u50cf\u53ca\u5176\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u8de8\u533a\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u822a\u62cd\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u4ea4\u901a\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u57ce\u5e02\u89c4\u5212\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u7406\u533a\u57df\u95f4\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e8e\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\u3001\u57ce\u5e02\u5e03\u5c40\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08LDMs\uff09\u7f29\u5c0f\u6e90\u57df\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u822a\u62cd\u56fe\u50cf\u57df\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cAP50\u63d0\u5347\u5e45\u5ea6\u4e3a4-23%\u30016-10%\u30017-40%\u548c50%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u822a\u62cd\u56fe\u50cf\u8f66\u8f86\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u65b0\u897f\u5170\u548c\u72b9\u4ed6\u5dde\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Despite advances in adversarial training, a gap persists between\nmodel accuracy and robustness. To mitigate this issue, in this paper, we\npresent a multi-teacher adversarial robustness distillation using an adaptive\nlearning strategy. Specifically, our proposed method first trained multiple\nclones of a baseline CNN model using an adversarial training strategy on a pool\nof perturbed data acquired through different adversarial attacks. Once trained,\nthese adversarially trained models are used as teacher models to supervise the\nlearning of a student model on clean data using multi-teacher knowledge\ndistillation. To ensure an effective robustness distillation, we design an\nadaptive learning strategy that controls the knowledge contribution of each\nmodel by assigning weights as per their prediction precision.

In contrast, natural language provides a more flexible,\nexpressive, and interpretable way to represent emotions, offering a much\nbroader source of supervision. Yet, leveraging semantically rich natural\nlanguage captions as supervisory signals for facial emotion representation\nlearning remains relatively underexplored, primarily due to two key challenges:\n1) the lack of large-scale caption datasets with rich emotional semantics, and\n2) the absence of effective frameworks tailored to harness such rich\nsupervision. To this end, we introduce EmoCap100K, a large-scale facial emotion\ncaption dataset comprising over 100,000 samples, featuring rich and structured\nsemantic descriptions that capture both global affective states and\nfine-grained local facial behaviors.
