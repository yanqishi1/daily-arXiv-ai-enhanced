As users exhibit diverse preferences, personalization has attracted increasing attention in LLM routing, since even identical queries may require different models to generate responses tailored to individual needs. However, existing approaches are not fully personalized and often fail to capture the complex interactions between specific users and LLMs. Moreover, user preference data is typically scarce, noisy, and inconsistent in format, which limits the effectiveness of methods that rely solely on user-specific data. To address these challenges, we propose GMTRouter, which represents multi-turn user-LLM interactions as a heterogeneous graph with four node types: user, LLM, query, and response, thereby preserving the rich relational structure of the interaction. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, GMTRouter learns to capture user preferences from few-shot data within a lightweight inductive graph learning framework, enabling effective personalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMTRouter consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.9 to 21.6 percent higher accuracy and 0.006 to 0.309 higher AUC across multiple datasets. More importantly, we demonstrate that GMTRouter can adapt to new users and evolving preferences using only few-shot data, without extensive fine-tuning.

We collected authentic human conversations from Reddit and generated artificial conversations on the same topic with two LLMs: Llama 3 70B and GPT-4o. When presented side-by-side to study participants, LLM-generated conversations were mistaken for human-created content 39\\% of the time. In particular, when evaluating conversations generated by Llama 3, participants correctly identified them as AI-generated only 56\\% of the time, barely better than random chance.

These systems hold promise for advancing legal analysis and compliance monitoring in sensitive domains. However, this capability comes with a troubling contradiction: while LLMs can analyze and interpret laws, they also demonstrate alarming vulnerabilities in generating unsafe outputs, such as actionable steps for bioweapon creation, despite their safeguards. To address this challenge, we propose a methodology that integrates knowledge graph construction with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to systematically evaluate LLMs' understanding of this law, their capacity to assess legal intent (mens rea), and their potential for unsafe applications. Through structured experiments, we assess their accuracy in identifying legal violations, generating prohibited instructions, and detecting unlawful intent in bioweapons-related scenarios. Our findings reveal significant limitations in LLMs' reasoning and safety mechanisms, but they also point the way forward. By combining enhanced safety protocols with more robust legal reasoning frameworks, this research lays the groundwork for developing LLMs that can ethically and securely assist in sensitive legal domains - ensuring they act as protectors of the law rather than inadvertent enablers of its violation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u590d\u6742\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u5982\u7f8e\u56fd\u6cd5\u5178\u7b2c18\u7bc7\u7b2c175\u6761\u5173\u4e8e\u751f\u7269\u6b66\u5668\u7684\u89c4\u5b9a\uff09\u65f6\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u4e0e\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u548cRAG\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u610f\u56fe\u5224\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u5728\u654f\u611f\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u53d8\u9769\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u77db\u76fe\uff1a\u65e2\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u6cd5\u5f8b\uff0c\u53c8\u53ef\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u5371\u9669\u5185\u5bb9\uff08\u5982\u751f\u7269\u6b66\u5668\u5236\u9020\u6b65\u9aa4\uff09\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210(RAG)\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u8bc6\u522b\u6cd5\u5f8b\u8fdd\u89c4\u3001\u751f\u6210\u7981\u6b62\u6307\u4ee4\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u975e\u6cd5\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u5b89\u5168\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u9053\u5fb7\u5b89\u5168\u5730\u534f\u52a9\u654f\u611f\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9886\u57df\u7684LLMs\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5b83\u4eec\u6210\u4e3a\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u8005\u800c\u975e\u65e0\u610f\u4e2d\u7684\u8fdd\u6cd5\u4fc3\u6210\u8005\u3002"}}

This is the context in which the Generative Artificial Intelligence models described in this paper are positioned, developed by Engineering Ingegneria Informatica SpA in order to automate the plant structures acquisition of SNAM energy infrastructure, a leading gas transportation company in Italy and Europe. The digitization of a gas plant consists in registering all its relevant information through the interpretation of the related documentation. The aim of this work is therefore to design an effective solution based on Artificial Intelligence techniques to automate the extraction of the information necessary for the digitization of a plant, in order to streamline the daily work of MGM users. The solution received the P&ID of the plant as input, each one in pdf format, and uses OCR, Vision LLM, Object Detection, Relational Reasoning and optimization algorithms to return an output consisting of two sets of information: a structured overview of the relevant design data and the hierarchical framework of the plant. To achieve convincing results, we extend a state-of-the-art model for Scene Graph Generation introducing a brand new Transformer architecture with the aim of deepening the analysis of the complex relations between the plant's components. The synergistic use of the listed AI-based technologies allowed to overcome many obstacles arising from the high variety of data, due to the lack of standardization.

However, recent studies reveal that alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO significantly reduce the diversity of LLM outputs. Not only do aligned LLMs generate text with repetitive structure and word choice, they also approach problems in more uniform ways, and their responses reflect a narrower range of societal perspectives. We attribute this problem to the KL divergence regularizer employed in preference learning algorithms. This causes the model to systematically overweight majority opinions and sacrifice diversity in its outputs. To address this, we propose Soft Preference Learning, which decouples the entropy and cross-entropy terms in the KL penalty - allowing for fine-grained control over LLM generation diversity. From a capabilities perspective, LLMs trained using Soft Preference Learning attain higher accuracy on difficult repeated sampling tasks and produce outputs with greater semantic and lexical diversity. From an alignment perspective, they are capable of representing a wider range of societal viewpoints and display improved logit calibration.

However, this mechanism can introduce lip leaking, where generated lips are influenced by the reference image rather than solely by the driving audio. Such leakage is difficult to detect with standard metrics and conventional test setup. To address this, we propose a systematic evaluation methodology to analyze and quantify lip leakage. Our framework employs three complementary test setups: silent-input generation, mismatched audio-video pairing, and matched audio-video synthesis. We also introduce derived metrics including lip-sync discrepancy and silent-audio-based lip-sync scores.

This paper introduces MATRIX (Multi-Aerial TRacking In compleX environments), a comprehensive dataset featuring synchronized footage from eight drones with continuously changing positions, and a novel deep learning framework for multi-view detection and tracking. Unlike existing datasets that rely on static cameras or limited drone coverage, MATRIX provides a challenging scenario with 40 pedestrians and a significant architectural obstruction in an urban environment. Our framework addresses the unique challenges of dynamic drone-based surveillance through real-time camera calibration, feature-based image registration, and multi-view feature fusion in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Experimental results demonstrate that while static camera methods maintain over 90\\% detection and tracking precision and accuracy metrics in a simplified MATRIX environment without an obstruction, 10 pedestrians and a much smaller observational area, their performance significantly degrades in the complex environment. Our proposed approach maintains robust performance with $\\sim$90\\% detection and tracking accuracy, as well as successfully tracks $\\sim$80\\% of trajectories under challenging conditions. Transfer learning experiments reveal strong generalization capabilities, with the pretrained model achieving much higher detection and tracking accuracy performance compared to training the model from scratch. Additionally, systematic camera dropout experiments reveal graceful performance degradation, demonstrating practical robustness for real-world deployments where camera failures may occur.

However, existing approaches predominantly rely on static single-subspace representations, neglecting the dynamic interplay between multiple subspaces critical for capturing complex geometric structures. To address this limitation, we propose a topology-driven multi-subspace fusion framework that enables adaptive subspace collaboration on the Grassmannian. Our solution introduces two key innovations: (1) Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, an adaptive multi-subspace modelling mechanism is proposed that dynamically selects and weights task-relevant subspaces via topological convergence analysis, and (2) a multi-subspace interaction block that fuses heterogeneous geometric representations through Fr\u00e9chet mean optimisation on the manifold. Theoretically, we establish the convergence guarantees of adaptive subspaces under a projection metric topology, ensuring stable gradient-based optimisation. Practically, we integrate Riemannian batch normalisation and mutual information regularisation to enhance discriminability and robustness. Extensive experiments on 3D action recognition (HDM05, FPHA), EEG classification (MAMEM-SSVEPII), and graph tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.

However, existing defenses always assume that an external attacker crafts the harmful query, and the possibility of a model's own output becoming a new attack vector has not been sufficiently explored. In this study, we propose the Self-HarmLLM scenario, which uses a Mitigated Harmful Query (MHQ) generated by the same model as a new input. An MHQ is an ambiguous query whose original intent is preserved while its harmful nature is not directly exposed. We verified whether a jailbreak occurs when this MHQ is re-entered into a separate session of the same model. We conducted experiments on GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA3-8B-instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B under Base, Zero-shot, and Few-shot conditions. The results showed up to 52% transformation success rate and up to 33% jailbreak success rate in the Zero-shot condition, and up to 65% transformation success rate and up to 41% jailbreak success rate in the Few-shot condition. By performing both prefix-based automated evaluation and human evaluation, we found that the automated evaluation consistently overestimated jailbreak success, with an average difference of 52%.

Prior methods for motion-conditioned synthesis typically require model-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and restrictive. We introduce Time-to-Move (TTM), a training-free, plug-and-play framework for motion- and appearance-controlled video generation with image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models. Our key insight is to use crude reference animations obtained through user-friendly manipulations such as cut-and-drag or depth-based reprojection. Motivated by SDEdit's use of coarse layout cues for image editing, we treat the crude animations as coarse motion cues and adapt the mechanism to the video domain. We preserve appearance with image conditioning and introduce dual-clock denoising, a region-dependent strategy that enforces strong alignment in motion-specified regions while allowing flexibility elsewhere, balancing fidelity to user intent with natural dynamics. This lightweight modification of the sampling process incurs no additional training or runtime cost and is compatible with any backbone. Extensive experiments on object and camera motion benchmarks show that TTM matches or exceeds existing training-based baselines in realism and motion control. Beyond this, TTM introduces a unique capability: precise appearance control through pixel-level conditioning, exceeding the limits of text-only prompting.

Existing embedding-based CAD approaches continuously update a memory bank with new embeddings to adapt to sequential tasks. However, these methods require constructing class-specific sub-memory banks for each task, which restricts their flexibility and scalability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CAD framework where all tasks share a unified memory bank. During training, the method incrementally updates embeddings within a fixed-size coreset, enabling continuous knowledge acquisition from sequential tasks without task-specific memory fragmentation. In the inference phase, anomaly scores are computed via a nearest-neighbor matching mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art detection accuracy. We validate the method through comprehensive experiments on MVTec AD and Visa datasets. Results show that our approach outperforms existing baselines, achieving average image-level AUROC scores of 0.972 (MVTec AD) and 0.891 (Visa).

While general-purpose large language models (LLMs) can generate text, they lack domain-specific knowledge, leading to hallucinations and requiring extensive expert revision. This study presents a proof-of-concept system integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with curated knowledge bases to generate pediatric SLP case materials. A multi-model RAG-based system was prototyped integrating curated domain knowledge with engineered prompt templates, supporting five commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) and open-source (Llama 3.2, Qwen 2.5-7B) LLMs. Seven test scenarios spanning diverse disorder types and grade levels were systematically designed. Generated cases underwent automated quality assessment using a multi-dimensional rubric evaluating structural completeness, internal consistency, clinical appropriateness, and IEP goal/session note quality. This proof-of-concept demonstrates technical feasibility for RAG-augmented generation of pediatric SLP vignettes. Commercial models showed marginal quality advantages, but open-source alternatives achieved acceptable performance, suggesting potential for privacy-preserving institutional deployment.

However, two key challenges hinder real-world deployment: (1) noisy or degraded sensory inputs from weather, motion blur, or hardware limitations, and (2) the need to issue timely yet reliable predictions that balance early alerts with false-alarm suppression. We propose a unified framework that integrates diffusion-based denoising with a time-aware actor-critic model to address these challenges. The diffusion module reconstructs noise-resilient image and object features through iterative refinement, preserving critical motion and interaction cues under sensor degradation. In parallel, the actor-critic architecture leverages long-horizon temporal reasoning and time-weighted rewards to determine the optimal moment to raise an alert, aligning early detection with reliability. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and significant gains in mean time-to-accident, while maintaining robust performance under Gaussian and impulse noise. Qualitative analyses further show that our model produces earlier, more stable, and human-aligned predictions in both routine and highly complex traffic scenarios, highlighting its potential for real-world, safety-critical deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u6563\u53bb\u566a\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7684actor-critic\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u7684\u4e8b\u6545\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9000\u5316\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e9\u671f\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9884\u8b66\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e8b\u6545\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8f93\u5165\u566a\u58f0/\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9700\u8981\u5728\u53ca\u65f6\u9884\u8b66\u548c\u8bef\u62a5\u6291\u5236\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u5757\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ec6\u5316\u91cd\u5efa\u6297\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u91c7\u7528actor-critic\u67b6\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u957f\u671f\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u52a0\u6743\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u4f73\u9884\u8b66\u65f6\u673a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6(DAD\u3001CCD\u3001A3D)\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5e73\u5747\u4e8b\u6545\u524d\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u65af\u548c\u8109\u51b2\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e38\u89c4\u548c\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u65e9\u3001\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4e8b\u6545\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

In this paper, we extend this approach to develop a similar framework for Bengali and apply it to translation tasks between English and Bengali. A central focus of our work lies in reassessing the effectiveness of DisCoCirc in reducing language bureaucracy. Unlike the result suggested in [5], our findings indicate that although it works well for a large part of the language, it still faces limitations due to the structural variation of the two languages. We discuss the possible methods that might handle these shortcomings and show that, in practice, DisCoCirc still struggles even with relatively simple sentences. This divergence from prior claims not only highlights the framework's constraints in translation but also suggest scope for future improvement.

While spatio-temporal features learned by foundation models have deepened general understanding of video content, sharing or storing these extracted visual features for downstream tasks inadvertently reveals sensitive personal information like skin color, gender, or clothing. Current privacy preservation methods focus on input-pixel-level anonymization, which requires retraining the entire utility video model and results in task-specific anonymization, making them unsuitable for recent video foundational models. To address these challenges, we introduce a lightweight Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM) that removes private information from video features while retaining general task utility. AAM can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion to frozen video encoders, minimizing the computational burden of finetuning and re-extracting features. Our framework employs three newly designed training objectives: (1) a clip-level self-supervised privacy objective to reduce mutual information between static clips, (2) a co-training objective to retain utility across seen tasks, and (3) a latent consistency loss for generalization on unseen tasks. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate a significant 35% reduction in privacy leakage while maintaining near-baseline utility performance across various downstream tasks: Action Recognition (Kinetics400, UCF101, HMDB51), Temporal Action Detection (THUMOS14), and Anomaly Detection (UCF-Crime). We also provide an analysis on anonymization for sensitive temporal attribute recognition. Additionally, we propose new protocols for assessing gender bias in action recognition models, showing that our method effectively mitigates such biases and promotes more equitable video understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4fdd\u62a4\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u533f\u540d\u9002\u914d\u5668\u6a21\u5757(AAM)\u4ece\u89c6\u9891\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\u79fb\u9664\u79c1\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u901a\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u5f81\u4f1a\u65e0\u610f\u4e2d\u6cc4\u9732\u654f\u611f\u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u80a4\u8272\u3001\u6027\u522b\u3001\u670d\u88c5\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u533f\u540d\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6574\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u533f\u540d\u9002\u914d\u5668\u6a21\u5757(AAM)\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff1a\u526a\u8f91\u7ea7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9690\u79c1\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u534f\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0a\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c1135%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u65f6\u5e8f\u52a8\u4f5c\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u6548\u7528\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u901a\u7528\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u53c8\u80fd\u7ef4\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force in healthcare in recent years and Large Language Models (LLMs) have been employed in various fields of medical decision-support systems. We studied responses of a group of different LLMs to real cases in emergency medicine. The results of our study on five most renown LLMs showed significant differences in capabilities of Large Language Models for diagnostics acute diseases in medical emergencies with accuracy ranging between 58% and 65%. This accuracy significantly exceeds the reported accuracy of human doctors. We built a super-learner MEDAS (Medical Emergency Diagnostic Advising System) of five major LLMs - Gemini, Llama, Grok, GPT, and Claude). The super-learner produces higher diagnostic accuracy, 70%, even with a quite basic meta-learner. However, at least one of the integrated LLMs in the same super-learner produces 85% correct diagnoses. The super-learner integrates a cluster of LLMs using a meta-learner capable of learning different capabilities of each LLM to leverage diagnostic accuracy of the model by collective capabilities of all LLMs in the cluster. The results of our study showed that aggregated diagnostic accuracy provided by a meta-learning approach exceeds that of any individual LLM, suggesting that the super-learner can take advantage of the combined knowledge of the medical datasets used to train the group of LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6025\u8bca\u533b\u5b66\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u572858%-65%\u4e4b\u95f4\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u4eba\u7c7b\u533b\u751f\u3002\u6784\u5efa\u4e86MEDAS\u8d85\u7ea7\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4e94\u79cdLLM\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u5b9e\u73b070%\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u9ad8\u53ef\u8fbe85%\u3002", "motivation": "\u6025\u8bca\u533b\u5b66\u4e2d\u5feb\u901f\u51c6\u786e\u8bca\u65ad\u5bf9\u60a3\u8005\u6551\u6cbb\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002AI\u548cLLMs\u5728\u533b\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u5728\u6025\u8bca\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u96c6\u6210\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e94\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41LLM\uff08Gemini\u3001Llama\u3001Grok\u3001GPT\u3001Claude\uff09\u5904\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u6025\u8bca\u75c5\u4f8b\uff0c\u6784\u5efaMEDAS\u8d85\u7ea7\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u6574\u5408\u5404LLM\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5355\u4e2aLLM\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u738758%-65%\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u4eba\u7c7b\u533b\u751f\u3002MEDAS\u8d85\u7ea7\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe70%\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u738785%\u3002\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u96c6\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6025\u8bca\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u5404LLM\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

Starting with images at resolutions of 32x32, we train a family of Transformers using IsoFlops profiles across compute budgets up to 7e19 FLOPs and evaluate three distinct target metrics: next-pixel prediction objective, ImageNet classification accuracy, and generation quality measured by Fr'echet Distance. First, optimal scaling strategy is critically task-dependent. At a fixed 32x32 resolution alone, the optimal scaling properties for image classification and image generation diverge, where generation optimal setup requires the data size grow three to five times faster than for the classification optimal setup. Second, as image resolution increases, the optimal scaling strategy indicates that the model size must grow much faster than data size. Surprisingly, by projecting our findings, we discover that the primary bottleneck is compute rather than the amount of training data. As compute continues to grow four to five times annually, we forecast the feasibility of pixel-by-pixel modeling of images within the next five years.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9010\u50cf\u7d20\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a32x32\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\uff0c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u968f\u7740\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u9700\u8981\u6bd4\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u957f\u66f4\u5feb\u3002\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u800c\u975e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9010\u50cf\u7d20\u9884\u6d4b\u8fd9\u4e00\u7b80\u5355\u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528IsoFlops\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u9ad8\u8fbe7e19 FLOPs\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u6307\u6807\uff1a\u9010\u50cf\u7d20\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u3001ImageNet\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff08Fr'echet\u8ddd\u79bb\uff09\u3002", "result": "1) \u5728\u56fa\u5b9a32x32\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\uff0c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u8981\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u6bd4\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u5feb3-5\u500d\u589e\u957f\uff1b2) \u968f\u7740\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u9700\u8981\u6bd4\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u957f\u66f4\u5feb\uff1b3) \u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u800c\u975e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u9650\u5236\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u8003\u8651\u5230\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u6bcf\u5e74\u589e\u957f4-5\u500d\uff0c\u9884\u8ba1\u672a\u67655\u5e74\u5185\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9010\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5efa\u6a21\u3002"}}

However, SFT for domain specialization can be resource-intensive and sometimes leads to a deterioration in performance over general capabilities due to catastrophic forgetting (CF). To address these issues, we propose a self-adaptive gradient-aware data selection approach (GrADS) for supervised fine-tuning of LLMs, which identifies effective subsets of training data by analyzing gradients obtained from a preliminary training phase. Specifically, we design self-guided criteria that leverage the magnitude and statistical distribution of gradients to prioritize examples that contribute the most to the model's learning process. This approach enables the acquisition of representative samples that enhance LLMs understanding of domain-specific tasks. Through extensive experimentation with various LLMs across diverse domains such as medicine, law, and finance, GrADS has demonstrated significant efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Remarkably, utilizing merely 5% of the selected GrADS data, LLMs already surpass the performance of those fine-tuned on the entire dataset, and increasing to 50% of the data results in significant improvements! With catastrophic forgetting substantially mitigated simultaneously.

Venkatesh Babu"], "title": "Harnessing Diffusion-Generated Synthetic Images for Fair Image Classification", "comment": null, "summary": "Image classification systems often inherit biases from uneven group representation in training data. For example, in face datasets for hair color classification, blond hair may be disproportionately associated with females, reinforcing stereotypes. A recent approach leverages the Stable Diffusion model to generate balanced training data, but these models often struggle to preserve the original data distribution. In this work, we explore multiple diffusion-finetuning techniques, e.g., LoRA and DreamBooth, to generate images that more accurately represent each training group by learning directly from their samples. Additionally, in order to prevent a single DreamBooth model from being overwhelmed by excessive intra-group variations, we explore a technique of clustering images within each group and train a DreamBooth model per cluster. These models are then used to generate group-balanced data for pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the studied finetuning approaches outperform vanilla Stable Diffusion on average and achieve results comparable to SOTA debiasing techniques like Group-DRO, while surpassing them as the dataset bias severity increases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ecf\u5e38\u56e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7fa4\u4f53\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5747\u800c\u7ee7\u627f\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u4eba\u8138\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u91d1\u53d1\u4e0e\u5973\u6027\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5173\u8054\u4f1a\u5f3a\u5316\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528Stable Diffusion\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "method": "\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u79cd\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u6280\u672f\uff08LoRA\u548cDreamBooth\uff09\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u751f\u6210\u5404\u7fa4\u4f53\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\u4e3a\u9632\u6b62\u5355\u4e2aDreamBooth\u6a21\u578b\u88ab\u7ec4\u5185\u53d8\u5f02\u6df9\u6ca1\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u805a\u7c7b\u6280\u672f\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u805a\u7c7b\u8bad\u7ec3\u5355\u72ec\u7684DreamBooth\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u751f\u6210\u7fa4\u4f53\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u539f\u59cbStable Diffusion\uff0c\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u53bb\u504f\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982Group-DRO\uff09\u6548\u679c\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u504f\u89c1\u4e25\u91cd\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u504f\u89c1\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002"}}

While some people with suicidal thoughts may try to suppress them, many signal their intentions in social media platforms. To address these issues, we propose a new type of hybrid deep learning scheme, i.e., the combination of a CNN architecture and a BiGRU technique, which can accurately identify the patterns of suicidal ideation from SN datasets. Also, we apply Explainable AI methods using SHapley Additive exPlanations to interpret the prediction results and verifying the model reliability. This integration of CNN local feature extraction, BiGRU bidirectional sequence modeling, attention mechanisms, and SHAP interpretability provides a comprehensive framework for suicide detection. Training and evaluation of the system were performed on a publicly available dataset. Several performance metrics were used for evaluating model performance.

Unlike GCNs that use fixed activation functions, KANs employ learnable functions on graph edges, allowing data-driven, adaptive feature transformations. This enhances the model's adaptability and expressiveness, making it more expressive in learning complex pose variations. Our model employs multi-hop feature aggregation, ensuring the body joints can leverage information from both local and distant neighbors, leading to improved spatial awareness. It also incorporates residual PoseKAN blocks for deeper feature refinement, and a global response normalization for improved feature selectivity and contrast. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our model against state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPoseKAN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06KAN\u7f51\u7edc\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5355\u56fe\u50cf2D\u52303D\u59ff\u6001\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8fb9\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u591a\u8df3\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\u89e3\u51b3GCN\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u9650\u5236\u548c\u9891\u8c31\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "GCN\u65b9\u6cd5\u57283D\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5c40\u90e8\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6355\u6349\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u9891\u8c31\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u906e\u6321\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u7cca\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u56feKAN\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5728\u8fb9\u4e0a\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u51fd\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7279\u5f81\u53d8\u6362\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u8df3\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\u4f7f\u5173\u8282\u80fd\u4ece\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u8fdc\u8ddd\u79bb\u90bb\u5c45\u83b7\u53d6\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u5305\u542b\u6b8b\u5deePoseKAN\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u7ec6\u5316\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u54cd\u5e94\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "PoseKAN\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8fb9\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u591a\u8df3\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u59ff\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u57283D\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

However, extracting such information from unstructured patient narratives is challenging due to the subtle, overlapping nature of cognitive constructs. This study developed and evaluated natural language processing (NLP) models to automatically identify categories that reflect various cognitive processes from de-identified first-person narratives. Three model families, a Bio_ClinicalBERT-based span categorization model for nested entity recognition, a fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct model using QLoRA for instruction following, and GPT-4o mini evaluated under zero- and few-shot settings, were compared on their performance on extracting seven categories. Our findings indicated that model performance varied substantially across categories and model families. The fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct achieved the highest overall F1-scores (0.74 micro-average and 0.59 macro-average), particularly excelling in context-dependent categories such as thought and social interaction. Bio_ClinicalBERT exhibited high precision but low recall and performed comparable to Llama for some category types such as location and time but failed on other categories such as thought, emotion and social interaction. Compared to conventional information extraction tasks, this task presents a greater challenge due to the abstract and overlapping nature of narrative accounts of complex cognitive processes. Nonetheless, with continued refinement, these NLP systems hold promise for enabling low-burden, longitudinal monitoring of cognitive function and serving as a valuable complement to formal neuropsychological assessments in PD.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e09\u79cdNLP\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u81ea\u8ff0\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u65e5\u5e38\u751f\u6d3b\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u4f53\u9a8c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e3a\u75be\u75c5\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u60c5\u7eea\u53d8\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u4ece\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u60a3\u8005\u53d9\u8ff0\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u6b64\u7c7b\u4fe1\u606f\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eBio_ClinicalBERT\u7684\u5d4c\u5957\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u4f7f\u7528QLoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u7684Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684GPT-4o mini\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u53d6\u4e03\u4e2a\u8ba4\u77e5\u7c7b\u522b\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u7684Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u9ad8F1\u5206\u6570\uff08\u5fae\u89c2\u5e73\u57470.74\uff0c\u5b8f\u89c2\u5e73\u57470.59\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\u7c7b\u522b\u5982\u601d\u7ef4\u548c\u793e\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002Bio_ClinicalBERT\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4f46\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4f4e\uff0cGPT-4o mini\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u822c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u7531\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53d9\u8ff0\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u91cd\u53e0\u6027\uff0c\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u7ecf\u8fc7\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9bNLP\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u671b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u8d1f\u62c5\u7684\u7eb5\u5411\u8ba4\u77e5\u529f\u80fd\u76d1\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u6b63\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u8865\u5145\u3002"}}

Traditional defense strategies typically operate within this fragile pixel domain, lacking mechanisms to incorporate inherently robust visual features. In this work, we introduce SIFT-Graph, a multimodal defense framework that enhances the robustness of traditional vision models by aggregating structurally meaningful features extracted from raw images using both handcrafted and learned modalities. Specifically, we integrate Scale-Invariant Feature Transform keypoints with a Graph Attention Network to capture scale and rotation invariant local structures that are resilient to perturbations. These robust feature embeddings are then fused with traditional vision model, such as Vision Transformer and Convolutional Neural Network, to form a unified, structure-aware and perturbation defensive model.

Existing diffusion-based approaches focus rather on small camera movements in real scenes or only consider unnatural object-centric scenes, limiting their potential applications in real-world settings. In this paper we move away from these constrained regimes and propose a 3D diffusion model trained with image-only losses on a large-scale dataset of real-world, multi-category, unaligned, and casually acquired videos of everyday scenes. We propose DT-NVS, a 3D-aware diffusion model for generalized novel view synthesis that exploits a transformer-based architecture backbone. We make significant contributions to transformer and self-attention architectures to translate images to 3d representations, and novel camera conditioning strategies to allow training on real-world unaligned datasets. In addition, we introduce a novel training paradigm swapping the role of reference frame between the conditioning image and the sampled noisy input.

Yet, real-world conversations naturally involve fluid transitions between these modes. To address this gap, we introduce TACT (TOD-And-Chitchat Transition), a dataset designed for transition-aware dialogue modeling that incorporates structurally diverse and integrated mode flows. TACT supports both user- and agent-driven mode switches, enabling robust modeling of complex conversational dynamics. To evaluate an agent's ability to initiate and recover from mode transitions, we propose two new metrics -- Switch and Recovery. Models trained on TACT outperform baselines in both intent detection and mode transition handling. Moreover, applying Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to TACT-trained models yields additional gains, achieving 75.74\\% joint mode-intent accuracy and a 70.1\\% win rate against GPT-4o in human evaluation.

However, these approaches often suffer from the loss of global pose information, making them incapable of distinguishing geometrically similar but spatially distinct structures. We identify that this limitation stems from the restricted receptive field in existing RI methods, leading to Wing-tip feature collapse, a failure to differentiate symmetric components (e.g., left and right airplane wings) due to indistinguishable local geometries. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the Shadow-informed Pose Feature (SiPF), which augments local RI descriptors with a globally consistent reference point (referred to as the 'shadow') derived from a learned shared rotation. This mechanism enables the model to preserve global pose awareness while maintaining rotation invariance. We further propose Rotation-invariant Attention Convolution (RIAttnConv), an attention-based operator that integrates SiPFs into the feature aggregation process, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to distinguish structurally similar components. Additionally, we design a task-adaptive shadow locating module based on the Bingham distribution over unit quaternions, which dynamically learns the optimal global rotation for constructing consistent shadows. Extensive experiments on 3D classification and part segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms existing RI methods, particularly in tasks requiring fine-grained spatial discrimination under arbitrary rotations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d83D\u70b9\u4e91\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9634\u5f71\u4fe1\u606f\u59ff\u6001\u7279\u5f81(SiPF)\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5377\u79ef(RIAttnConv)\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u53d7\u9650\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7ffc\u5c16\u7279\u5f81\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u5168\u5c40\u59ff\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684RI\u7279\u5f81\u66ff\u4ee3\u539f\u59cb\u5750\u6807\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u5bf9\u4efb\u610f\u65cb\u8f6c\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u4e22\u5931\u5168\u5c40\u59ff\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u51e0\u4f55\u76f8\u4f3c\u4f46\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982\u98de\u673a\u5de6\u53f3\u673a\u7ffc\uff09\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u9650\u5236\u6e90\u4e8e\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u53d7\u9650\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7ffc\u5c16\u7279\u5f81\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u9634\u5f71\u4fe1\u606f\u59ff\u6001\u7279\u5f81(SiPF)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u65cb\u8f6c\u751f\u6210\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u70b9\uff08\u9634\u5f71\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u5c40\u90e8RI\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u59ff\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u7ed3\u5408\uff1b2. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5377\u79ef(RIAttnConv)\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210SiPF\uff1b3. \u57fa\u4e8eBingham\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9634\u5f71\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u4f18\u5168\u5c40\u65cb\u8f6c\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u9634\u5f71\u3002", "result": "\u57283D\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u90e8\u4ef6\u5206\u5272\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709RI\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4efb\u610f\u65cb\u8f6c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9634\u5f71\u4fe1\u606f\u59ff\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5377\u79ef\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u7ffc\u5c16\u7279\u5f81\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u5168\u5c40\u59ff\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents show significant potential, with capabilities in information retrieval, reasoning, and generation. However, their application to biomedical hypothesis generation has been limited by the absence of standardized datasets and execution environments. To address this, we introduce BioVerge, a comprehensive benchmark, and BioVerge Agent, an LLM-based agent framework, to create a standardized environment for exploring biomedical hypothesis generation at the frontier of existing scientific knowledge. Our dataset includes structured and textual data derived from historical biomedical hypotheses and PubMed literature, organized to support exploration by LLM agents. BioVerge Agent utilizes a ReAct-based approach with distinct Generation and Evaluation modules that iteratively produce and self-assess hypothesis proposals. Through extensive experimentation, we uncover key insights: 1) different architectures of BioVerge Agent influence exploration diversity and reasoning strategies; 2) structured and textual information sources each provide unique, critical contexts that enhance hypothesis generation; and 3) self-evaluation significantly improves the novelty and relevance of proposed hypotheses.", "AI": {"tldr": "BioVerge\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u5047\u8bbe\u751f\u6210\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548cLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528ReAct\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u81ea\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5236\u6765\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u9896\u4e14\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u5047\u8bbe\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u6216\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u63d0\u53d6\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u9896\u590d\u6742\u5173\u8054\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6267\u884c\u73af\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBioVerge\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548cBioVerge Agent\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528ReAct\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4ea7\u751f\u5e76\u81ea\u8bc4\u4f30\u5047\u8bbe\u63d0\u6848\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u548cPubMed\u6587\u732e\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09\u4e0d\u540c\u4ee3\u7406\u67b6\u6784\u5f71\u54cd\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff1b2\uff09\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u6e90\u5404\u81ea\u63d0\u4f9b\u72ec\u7279\u5173\u952e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff1b3\uff09\u81ea\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "BioVerge\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u5047\u8bbe\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u524d\u6cbf\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6e90\u4fe1\u606f\u6574\u5408\u548c\u81ea\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u591f\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u4f18\u8d28\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002"}}

However, existing SSM-based methods typically apply manually designed scan operations to flatten detected 2D pose sequences into purely temporal sequences, either locally or globally. This approach disrupts the inherent spatial structure of human poses and entangles spatial and temporal features, making it difficult to capture complex pose dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose the Skeleton Structure-Aware Stride SSM (SAS-SSM), which first employs a structure-aware spatiotemporal convolution to dynamically capture essential local interactions between joints, and then applies a stride-based scan strategy to construct multi-scale global structural representations. This enables flexible modeling of both local and global pose information while maintaining linear computational complexity. Built upon SAS-SSM, our model SasMamba achieves competitive 3D pose estimation performance with significantly fewer parameters compared to existing hybrid models.

The Two Sides of Probabilistic Learning in Large Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they have also been used to assist in citation recommendation, the hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce bibliographic records depends on whether the underlying knowledge is generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear in the pretraining corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency with which a given bibliographic record appears in the pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified 100 citations across twenty computer-science domains, and measured factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic metadata. The results revealed that (i) citation count is strongly correlated with factual accuracy, (ii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatim memorized beyond roughly 1,000 citations, and (iii) memory interference occurs when multiple highly cited papers share similar content. These findings indicate a threshold where generalization shifts into memorization, with highly cited papers being nearly verbatim retained in the model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u751f\u6210\u53c2\u8003\u6587\u732e\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u5176\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u9891\u7387\uff08\u4ee5\u5f15\u7528\u6b21\u6570\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\uff09\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u7ea61000\u6b21\u5f15\u7528\u7684\u8bba\u6587\u51e0\u4e4e\u88ab\u9010\u5b57\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u800c\u5f15\u7528\u6b21\u6570\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u8bba\u6587\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\u5f15\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5728\u53c2\u8003\u6587\u732e\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u5f15\u7528\u9891\u7387\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cdLLM\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528GPT-4.1\u572820\u4e2a\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u751f\u6210100\u4e2a\u5f15\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u5f15\u7528\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u5143\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5f15\u7528\u6b21\u6570\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5f15\u7528\u6b21\u6570\u4e0e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5448\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u8d85\u8fc7\u7ea61000\u6b21\u5f15\u7528\u7684\u8bba\u6587\u51e0\u4e4e\u88ab\u9010\u5b57\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff1b\u5f53\u591a\u4e2a\u9ad8\u5f15\u7528\u8bba\u6587\u5185\u5bb9\u76f8\u4f3c\u65f6\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u5b58\u5728\u4ece\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u9ad8\u5f15\u7528\u8bba\u6587\u51e0\u4e4e\u88ab\u9010\u5b57\u4fdd\u7559\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f15\u7528\u9891\u7387\u662f\u9884\u6d4bLLM\u751f\u6210\u53c2\u8003\u6587\u732e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6307\u6807\u3002"}}

Extant contrastive learning networks, whose two encoders often implicitly interact with each other by parameter sharing or momentum updating, may not fully exploit the complementarity and similarity of the positive pairs to extract clustering features from input data. To explicitly fuse the learned features of positive pairs, we design a novel multiple fusing-augmenting ViT blocks (MFAVBs) based on the excellent feature learning ability of Vision Transformers (ViT). Firstly, two preprocessed augmentions as positive pairs are separately fed into two shared-weight ViTs, then their output features are fused to input into a larger ViT. Secondly, the learned features are split into a pair of new augmented positive samples and passed to the next FAVBs, enabling multiple fusion and augmention through MFAVBs operations. Finally, the learned features are projected into both instance-level and clustering-level spaces to calculate the cross-entropy loss, followed by parameter updates by backpropagation to finalize the training process. To further enhance ability of the model to distinguish between similar images, our input data for the network we propose is preprocessed augmentions with features extracted from the CLIP pretrained model.

We used the challenge's publicly available training dataset to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of several variants of EfficientNet architectures (i.e., B0, B1, B2, B3, B4). EfficientNet-B1 and EfficientNet-B4 achieved the best performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.98 in a 5-fold cross-validation configuration using the BraTS-Path training set. The quantitative performance evaluation of our proposed approach with EfficientNet-B1 on the BraTS-Path hold-out validation data and the final hidden testing data yielded F1 scores of 0.546 and 0.517, respectively, for the associated 6-class classification task.

This raises a fundamental question: can we achieve a synergy with high throughput, higher GPU utilization, and AR level quality? Existing methods fail to effectively balance these two aspects, either prioritizing AR using a weaker model for sequential drafting (speculative decoding), leading to lower drafting efficiency, or using some form of left-to-right (AR-like) decoding logic for diffusion, which still suffers from quality degradation and forfeits its potential parallelizability. We introduce TiDAR, a sequence-level hybrid architecture that drafts tokens (Thinking) in Diffusion and samples final outputs (Talking) AutoRegressively - all within a single forward pass using specially designed structured attention masks. This design exploits the free GPU compute density, achieving a strong balance between drafting and verification capacity. Moreover, TiDAR is designed to be serving-friendly (low overhead) as a standalone model. We extensively evaluate TiDAR against AR models, speculative decoding, and diffusion variants across generative and likelihood tasks at 1.5B and 8B scales. Thanks to the parallel drafting and sampling as well as exact KV cache support, TiDAR outperforms speculative decoding in measured throughput and surpasses diffusion models like Dream and Llada in both efficiency and quality.

In tasks like natural language inference (NLI), human label variation (HLV) arises when multiple labels are valid for the same instance, making it difficult to separate annotation errors from plausible variation. An earlier framework VARIERR (Weber-Genzel et al., 2024) asks multiple annotators to explain their label decisions in the first round and flag errors via validity judgments in the second round. However, conducting two rounds of manual annotation is costly and may limit the coverage of plausible labels or explanations. Our study proposes a new framework, EVADE, for generating and validating explanations to detect errors using large language models (LLMs). We perform a comprehensive analysis comparing human- and LLM-detected errors for NLI across distribution comparison, validation overlap, and impact on model fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM validation refines generated explanation distributions to more closely align with human annotations, and that removing LLM-detected errors from training data yields improvements in fine-tuning performance than removing errors identified by human annotators.

The former leverages self-supervised learning to acquire semantic-based knowledge and provide personalized instruction for each student sample by dynamically selecting the relevant teacher samples. The latter seeks the optimal transport path by employing Lagrangian optimization.

However, existing latent reasoning methods lack mechanisms to ensure stable evolution of latent representations and a systematic way to interleave implicit and explicit reasoning. We introduce SpiralThinker, a unified framework that performs iterative updates over latent representations, enabling extended implicit reasoning without generating additional tokens. A progressive alignment objective combined with structured annotations maintains coherence between latent and textual reasoning. Across mathematical, logical, and commonsense reasoning tasks, SpiralThinker achieves the best overall performance among latent reasoning approaches, consistently surpassing previous methods across all benchmarks. Detailed analyses reveal that both iteration and alignment are indispensable, the numbers of latent tokens and iterations exhibit dataset-specific optima, and appropriate alignment proves critical for an effective iterative process.

However, existing evaluations of large language models (LLMs) often rely on short, static dialogues and fail to capture the dynamic and long-term nature of emotional support. To overcome this limitation, we shift from snapshot-based evaluation to trajectory-based assessment, adopting a user-centered perspective that evaluates models based on their ability to improve and stabilize user emotional states over time. Our framework constructs a large-scale benchmark consisting of 328 emotional contexts and 1,152 disturbance events, simulating realistic emotional shifts under evolving dialogue scenarios. To encourage psychologically grounded responses, we constrain model outputs using validated emotion regulation strategies such as situation selection and cognitive reappraisal. User emotional trajectories are modeled as a first-order Markov process, and we apply causally-adjusted emotion estimation to obtain unbiased emotional state tracking. Based on this framework, we introduce three trajectory-level metrics: Baseline Emotional Level (BEL), Emotional Trajectory Volatility (ETV), and Emotional Centroid Position (ECP).

Building upon our previous simulation study published in this journal, this study implements and evaluates the spectral-based approach on physical hardware to address this limitation. Specifically, this paper introduces HitoMi-Cam, a lightweight and shape-agnostic person detection method that uses the spectral reflectance properties of clothing. The author implemented the system on a resource-constrained edge device without a GPU to assess its practical viability. The results indicate that a processing speed of 23.2 frames per second (fps) (253x190 pixels) is achievable, suggesting that the method can be used for real-time applications. In a simulated search and rescue scenario where the performance of CNNs declines, HitoMi-Cam achieved an average precision (AP) of 93.5%, surpassing that of the compared CNN models (best AP of 53.8%). Throughout all evaluation scenarios, the occurrence of false positives remained minimal. This study positions the HitoMi-Cam method not as a replacement for CNN-based detectors but as a complementary tool under specific conditions.

To enhance the evaluation reliability, we integrate expert-informed ground answers into scoring rubrics that guide GPT-4o in annotating responses and generating reference critiques, which serve as anchors for trustworthy judgments. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of MM-CRITIC and provide a comprehensive assessment of leading LMMs' critique capabilities under multiple dimensions.

However, although these approaches perform well within training domains, they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization, often producing hallucinated content when encountering novel visual environments. Retrieval-based methods attempt to mitigate this limitation by leveraging external knowledge, but they can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination when retrieved captions contain entities irrelevant to the inputs. We introduce the concept of negative entities--objects that appear in generated caption but are absent from the input--and propose Negative Entity Suppression (NES) to tackle this challenge. NES seamlessly integrates three stages: (1) it employs synthetic images to ensure consistent image-to-text retrieval across both training and inference; (2) it filters negative entities from retrieved content to enhance accuracy; and (3) it applies attention-level suppression using identified negative entities to further minimize the impact of hallucination-prone features. Evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates that NES maintains competitive in-domain performance while improving cross-domain transfer and reducing hallucination rates, achieving new state-of-the-art results in ZIC.

Given the resource constraints of these devices, quantization offers a promising solution by improving memory efficiency and reducing bandwidth requirements, thereby facilitating the deployment of VLMs. However, existing research has rarely explored aggressive quantization on VLMs, particularly for the models ranging from 1B to 2B parameters, which are more suitable for resource-constrained edge devices. In this paper, we propose SPEED-Q, a novel Staged Processing with Enhanced Distillation framework for VLM low-bit weight-only quantization that systematically addresses the following two critical obstacles: (1) significant discrepancies in quantization sensitivity between vision (ViT) and language (LLM) components in VLMs; (2) training instability arising from the reduced numerical precision inherent in low-bit quantization. In SPEED-Q, a staged sensitivity adaptive mechanism is introduced to effectively harmonize performance across different modalities. We further propose a distillation-enhanced quantization strategy to stabilize the training process and reduce data dependence. Together, SPEED-Q enables accurate, stable, and data-efficient quantization of complex VLMs. SPEED-Q is the first framework tailored for quantizing entire small-scale billion-parameter VLMs to low bits. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SPEED-Q achieves up to 6x higher accuracy than existing quantization methods under 2-bit settings and consistently outperforms prior on-device VLMs under both 2-bit and 4-bit settings.

We propose Bi-RAR, a novel retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that evaluates each intermediate step jointly in both forward and backward directions. To assess the information completeness of each step, we introduce a bidirectional information distance grounded in Kolmogorov complexity, approximated via language model generation probabilities. This quantification measures both how far the current reasoning is from the answer and how well it addresses the question. To optimize reasoning under these bidirectional signals, we adopt a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework with a cascading reward structure that emphasizes early trajectory alignment.

While previous studies have benchmarked the humor capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), they have often relied on single-dimensional evaluations, such as judging whether something is simply ``funny.'' This paper argues that a multifaceted understanding of humor is necessary and addresses this gap by systematically evaluating LLMs through the lens of Oogiri, a form of Japanese improvisational comedy games. To achieve this, we expanded upon existing Oogiri datasets with data from new sources and then augmented the collection with Oogiri responses generated by LLMs. We then manually annotated this expanded collection with 5-point absolute ratings across six dimensions: Novelty, Clarity, Relevance, Intelligence, Empathy, and Overall Funniness. Using this dataset, we assessed the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs on two core tasks: their ability to generate creative Oogiri responses and their ability to evaluate the funniness of responses using a six-dimensional evaluation. Our results show that while LLMs can generate responses at a level between low- and mid-tier human performance, they exhibit a notable lack of Empathy.

While trajectory-based and distribution-based step distillation methods offer solutions, they present a fundamental trade-off. Trajectory-based methods preserve global structure but act as a \"lossy compressor\", sacrificing high-frequency details. Conversely, distribution-based methods can achieve higher fidelity but often suffer from mode collapse and unstable training. This paper recasts them from independent paradigms into synergistic components within our novel Hierarchical Distillation (HD) framework. We leverage trajectory distillation not as a final generator, but to establish a structural ``sketch\", providing a near-optimal initialization for the subsequent distribution-based refinement stage. This strategy yields an ideal initial distribution that enhances the ceiling of overall performance. To further improve quality, we introduce and refine the adversarial training process. We find standard discriminator structures are ineffective at refining an already high-quality generator. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Weighted Discriminator (AWD), tailored for the HD pipeline. By dynamically allocating token weights, AWD focuses on local imperfections, enabling efficient detail refinement. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks. On ImageNet $256\\times256$, our single-step model achieves an FID of 2.26, rivaling its 250-step teacher. It also achieves promising results on the high-resolution text-to-image MJHQ benchmark, proving its generalizability.

However, previous work shows unsatisfactory attack performance when transferring across heterogeneous model architectures. The main reason is that the gradient update directions of heterogeneous surrogate models differ widely, making it hard to reduce the gradient variance of ensemble models while making the best of individual model. To tackle this challenge, we design a novel ensemble attack, NAMEA, which for the first time integrates the gradients from the non-attention areas of ensemble models into the iterative gradient optimization process. Our design is inspired by the observation that the attention areas of heterogeneous models vary sharply, thus the non-attention areas of ViTs are likely to be the focus of CNNs and vice versa. Therefore, we merge the gradients respectively from the attention and non-attention areas of ensemble models so as to fuse the transfer information of CNNs and ViTs.

We reinterpret the attention map with positional encoding as a noisy feature map, and propose Denoising Positional Encoding (DoPE), a training-free method based on truncated matrix entropy to detect outlier frequency bands in the feature map. Leveraging the noise characteristics of the feature map, we further reparameterize it with a parameter-free Gaussian distribution to achieve robust extrapolation. Our method theoretically reveals the underlying cause of the attention sink phenomenon and its connection to truncated matrix entropy. Experiments on needle-in-a-haystack and many-shot in-context learning tasks demonstrate that DoPE significantly improves retrieval accuracy and reasoning stability across extended contexts (up to 64K tokens). The results show that the denoising strategy for positional embeddings effectively mitigates attention sinks and restores balanced attention patterns, providing a simple yet powerful solution for improving length generalization.

NBVC can adopt bi-directional reference frames for better compression performance.

To optimize reference information utilization, we propose a novel NBVC method, termed Bi-directional Reference Harmonization Video Compression (BRHVC), with the proposed Bi-directional Motion Converge (BMC) and Bi-directional Contextual Fusion (BCF). BMC converges multiple optical flows in motion compression, leading to more accurate motion compensation on a larger scale. Then BCF explicitly models the weights of reference contexts under the guidance of motion compensation accuracy. With more efficient motions and contexts, BRHVC can effectively harmonize bi-directional references. Experimental results indicate that our BRHVC outperforms previous state-of-the-art NVC methods, even surpassing the traditional coding, VTM-RA (under random access configuration), on the HEVC datasets.

Fractal Generative Models (FGMs) are efficient in generating high-quality images, but their inherent self-similarity limits the diversity of output images. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach based on the Hausdorff Dimension (HD), a widely recognized concept in fractal geometry used to quantify structural complexity, which aids in enhancing the diversity of generated outputs. To incorporate HD into FGM, we propose a learnable HD estimation method that predicts HD directly from image embeddings, addressing computational cost concerns. However, simply introducing HD into a hybrid loss is insufficient to enhance diversity in FGMs due to: 1) degradation of image quality, and 2) limited improvement in generation diversity. To this end, during training, we adopt an HD-based loss with a monotonic momentum-driven scheduling strategy to progressively optimize the hyperparameters, obtaining optimal diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Moreover, during inference, we employ HD-guided rejection sampling to select geometrically richer outputs. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our FGM-HD framework yields a 39\\% improvement in output diversity compared to vanilla FGMs, while preserving comparable image quality.

However, directly entering entire tables as long text into LLMs often leads to incorrect answers because most LLMs cannot inherently capture complex table structures. In this paper, we propose a cell extraction method for TQA without manual identification, even for complex table headers. Our approach estimates table headers by computing similarities between a given question and individual cells via a hybrid retrieval mechanism that integrates a language model and TF-IDF. We then select as the answer the cells at the intersection of the most relevant row and column. Furthermore, the language model is trained using contrastive learning on a small dataset of question-header pairs to enhance performance. We evaluated our approach in the TQA dataset from the U4 shared task at NTCIR-18. The experimental results show that our pipeline achieves an accuracy of 74.6\\%, outperforming existing LLMs such as GPT-4o mini~(63.9\\%).

However, these static images, having almost lost their authentication attributes, cannot be reliably verified and are vulnerable to malicious copying and reuse. To address these issues, we propose AuthSig, a novel static electronic signature framework based on generative models and watermark, which binds authentication information to the signature image. Leveraging the human visual system's insensitivity to subtle style variations, AuthSig finely modulates style embeddings during generation to implicitly encode watermark bits-enforcing a One Signature, One Use policy.To overcome the scarcity of handwritten signature data and the limitations of traditional augmentation methods, we introduce a keypoint-driven data augmentation strategy that effectively enhances style diversity to support robust watermark embedding.

A recent critique argued that the original results were confounded by how topics were selected for the topic-based component, and noted that the metric had not been validated against ground-truth measures of flow. That work proposed using only the contextual term as a more conceptually valid and interpretable alternative. In this paper, we empirically validate that proposal. Using two essay datasets with human-annotated trait scores, ASAP++ and ELLIPSE, we show that the contextual version of sequentiality aligns more closely with human assessments of discourse-level traits such as Organization and Cohesion. While zero-shot prompted LLMs predict trait scores more accurately than the contextual measure alone, the contextual measure adds more predictive value than both the topic-only and original sequentiality formulations when combined with standard linguistic features.

However, the effectiveness of this approach is heavily reliant on the selection of demonstrations, a process that is NP-hard. Traditional strategies, including random, similarity-based sampling and infoscore-based sampling, often lead to inefficiencies or suboptimal performance, struggling to balance both efficiency and effectiveness in demonstration selection. In this paper, we propose a novel demonstration selection framework named Coreset-based Dual Retrieval (CoDR). We show that samples within a diverse subset achieve a higher expected mutual information. To implement this, we introduce a cluster-pruning method to construct a diverse coreset that aligns more effectively with the query while maintaining diversity. Additionally, we develop a dual retrieval mechanism that enhances the selection process by achieving global demonstration selection while preserving efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the ICL performance compared to the existing strategies, providing a robust solution for effective and efficient demonstration selection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6838\u5fc3\u96c6\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u68c0\u7d22\u6846\u67b6CoDR\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u526a\u679d\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6838\u5fc3\u96c6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6f14\u793a\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6f14\u793a\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u968f\u673a\u3001\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u5206\u6570\u91c7\u6837\uff09\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6548\u679c\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e73\u8861\u4e24\u8005\uff0c\u800c\u6f14\u793a\u9009\u62e9\u672c\u8eab\u662fNP\u96be\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "CoDR\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u805a\u7c7b\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6838\u5fc3\u96c6\uff1b2\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cc\u91cd\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5c40\u6f14\u793a\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "CoDR\u4e3a\u6f14\u793a\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e2\u9ad8\u6548\u53c8\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Alternatively, it can be learned during training to optimise the training objective. In this paper we study the learning dynamics of subword segmentation: if a language model can dynamically optimise tokenisation, how do its subwords evolve during pretraining and finetuning? To explore this, we extend the subword segmental language model (SSLM), a framework for learning subwords during training, to support pretraining and finetuning. We train models for three typologically diverse languages to study learning dynamics across the morphological spectrum: Isi-Xhosa is conjunctive (long word forms composed of many morphemes), Setswana is disjunctive (morphemes written as separate words), and English represents a typological middle ground. We analyse subword dynamics from a linguistic perspective, tracking morphology, productivity, and fertility. We identify four stages of subword learning, with the morphologically complex isi-Xhosa exhibiting greater instability. During finetuning, subword boundaries shift to become finer-grained. Lastly, we show that learnable subwords offers a promising approach to improve text generation and cross-lingual transfer for low-resource, morphologically complex languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5b50\u8bcd\u5206\u5272\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b50\u8bcd\u4f1a\u7ecf\u5386\u56db\u4e2a\u5b66\u4e60\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5f62\u6001\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u66f4\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\u5b50\u8bcd\u8fb9\u754c\u4f1a\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5b50\u8bcd\u5206\u5272\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u9884\u5904\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u56fa\u5b9a\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u5b50\u8bcd\u5206\u5272\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u5f62\u6001\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55\u5b50\u8bcd\u5206\u6bb5\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(SSLM)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u5f62\u6001\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8bed\u8a00(isi-Xhosa\u3001Setswana\u3001\u82f1\u8bed)\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5b50\u8bcd\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5f62\u6001\u590d\u6742\u7684isi-Xhosa\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\u5b50\u8bcd\u8fb9\u754c\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5b50\u8bcd\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u3001\u5f62\u6001\u590d\u6742\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8fc1\u79fb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While diffusion-based anomaly detection has emerged as a promising approach for automated MA screening, its clinical application is hindered by three fundamental limitations. First, these models often fall prey to \"identity mapping\", where they inadvertently replicate the input image. Second, they struggle to distinguish MAs from other anomalies, leading to high false positives. Third, their suboptimal reconstruction of normal features hampers overall performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Wavelet Diffusion Transformer framework for MA Detection (WDT-MD), which features three key innovations: a noise-encoded image conditioning mechanism to avoid \"identity mapping\" by perturbing image conditions during training; pseudo-normal pattern synthesis via inpainting to introduce pixel-level supervision, enabling discrimination between MAs and other anomalies; and a wavelet diffusion Transformer architecture that combines the global modeling capability of diffusion Transformers with multi-scale wavelet analysis to enhance reconstruction of normal retinal features. Comprehensive experiments on the IDRiD and e-ophtha MA datasets demonstrate that WDT-MD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both pixel-level and image-level MA detection.

Within the iterative-convolution thresholding method (ICTM) framework, we propose a variational segmentation model that integrates denoising terms. Specifically, the denoising component consists of an I-divergence term and an adaptive total-variation (TV) regularizer, making the model well suited to images contaminated by Gamma--distributed multiplicative noise and Poisson noise. A spatially adaptive weight derived from a gray-level indicator guides diffusion differently across regions of varying intensity. To further address intensity inhomogeneity, we estimate a smoothly varying bias field, which improves segmentation accuracy. Regions are represented by characteristic functions, with contour length encoded accordingly. For efficient optimization, we couple ICTM with a relaxed modified scalar auxiliary variable (RMSAV) scheme. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world images with intensity inhomogeneity and diverse noise types show that the proposed model achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared with competing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u53bb\u566a\u9879\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u53d7Gamma\u5206\u5e03\u4e58\u6027\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6cca\u677e\u566a\u58f0\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94TV\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u504f\u7f6e\u573a\u4f30\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u53d7\u5230\u4e25\u91cd\u566a\u58f0\u6c61\u67d3\u548c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6027\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5728ICTM\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u96c6\u6210\u53bb\u566a\u9879\uff0c\u5305\u62ecI-\u6563\u5ea6\u9879\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94TV\u6b63\u5219\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7070\u5ea6\u6307\u793a\u5668\u5bfc\u51fa\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u5e73\u6ed1\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u504f\u7f6e\u573a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528RMSAV\u65b9\u6848\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6027\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u566a\u58f0\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ade\u4e89\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u566a\u58f0\u6c61\u67d3\u548c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, most existing methods optimize only for final task outcomes, leaving models vulnerable to collapse when negative rewards dominate early training. This challenge is especially pronounced in honesty alignment, where models must not only solve answerable queries but also identify when conclusions cannot be drawn from the given premises. Deductive reasoning provides an ideal testbed because it isolates reasoning capability from reliance on external factual knowledge. To investigate honesty alignment, we curate two multi-step deductive reasoning datasets from graph structures, one for linear algebra and one for logical inference, and introduce unanswerable cases by randomly perturbing an edge in half of the instances. We find that GRPO, with or without supervised fine tuning initialization, struggles on these tasks. Through extensive experiments across three models, we evaluate stabilization strategies and show that curriculum learning provides some benefit but requires carefully designed in distribution datasets with controllable difficulty. To address these limitations, we propose Anchor, a reinforcement learning method that injects ground truth trajectories into rollouts, preventing early training collapse. Our results demonstrate that this method stabilizes learning and significantly improves the overall reasoning performance, underscoring the importance of training dynamics for enabling reliable deductive reasoning in aligned language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAnchor\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u771f\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\u6ce8\u5165rollouts\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65e9\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f18\u5316\u6700\u7ec8\u4efb\u52a1\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8d1f\u5956\u52b1\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u8bda\u5b9e\u5bf9\u9f50\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8981\u56de\u7b54\u53ef\u89e3\u7b54\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u8fd8\u8981\u8bc6\u522b\u65e0\u6cd5\u4ece\u524d\u63d0\u5f97\u51fa\u7ed3\u8bba\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u4e24\u4e2a\u591a\u6b65\u6f14\u7ece\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u7ebf\u6027\u4ee3\u6570\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u6270\u52a8\u8fb9\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u53ef\u56de\u7b54\u6848\u4f8b\uff1b\u63d0\u51faAnchor\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728rollouts\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u771f\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eGRPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u5e2e\u52a9\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1bAnchor\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6f14\u7ece\u63a8\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0cAnchor\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u9632\u6b62\u65e9\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d29\u6e83\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8bda\u5b9e\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Current open-set object detectors, however, remain constrained by their exclusive reliance on positive indicators based on given prompts like text descriptions or visual exemplars. This positive-only paradigm experiences consistent vulnerability to visually similar but semantically different distractors. We propose T-Rex-Omni, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating negative visual prompts to negate hard negative distractors. Specifically, we first introduce a unified visual prompt encoder that jointly processes positive and negative visual prompts. Next, a training-free Negating Negative Computing (NNC) module is proposed to dynamically suppress negative responses during the probability computing stage. To further boost performance through fine-tuning, our Negating Negative Hinge (NNH) loss enforces discriminative margins between positive and negative embeddings. T-Rex-Omni supports flexible deployment in both positive-only and joint positive-negative inference modes, accommodating either user-specified or automatically generated negative examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate remarkable zero-shot detection performance, significantly narrowing the performance gap between visual-prompted and text-prompted methods while showing particular strength in long-tailed scenarios (51.2 AP_r on LVIS-minival).

Existing language-decoder based mitigation approaches often regulate visual or textual attention independently, overlooking their interaction as two key causal factors. To address this, we propose Owl (Bi-mOdal attention reWeighting for Layer-wise hallucination mitigation), a causally-grounded framework that models hallucination process via a structural causal graph, treating decomposed visual and textual attentions as mediators. We introduce VTACR (Visual-to-Textual Attention Contribution Ratio), a novel metric that quantifies the modality contribution imbalance during decoding. Our analysis reveals that hallucinations frequently occur in low-VTACR scenarios, where textual priors dominate and visual grounding is weakened. To mitigate this, we design a fine-grained attention intervention mechanism that dynamically adjusts token- and layer-wise attention guided by VTACR signals. Finally, we propose a dual-path contrastive decoding strategy: one path emphasizes visually grounded predictions, while the other amplifies hallucinated ones -- letting visual truth shine and hallucination collapse. Experimental results on the POPE and CHAIR benchmarks show that Owl achieves significant hallucination reduction, setting a new SOTA in faithfulness while preserving vision-language understanding capability.

However, controlling specific attributes of generated text remains challenging without architectural modifications or extensive fine-tuning. Current methods typically toggle a single, basic attribute but struggle with precise multi-attribute control. In scenarios where attribute requirements conflict, existing methods lack coordination mechanisms, causing interference between desired attributes. Furthermore, these methods fail to incorporate iterative optimization processes in the controlled generation pipeline. To address these limitations, we propose Conflict-aware, Composite, and Collaborative Controlled Text Generation (C$^3$TG), a two-phase framework for fine-grained, multi-dimensional text attribute control. During generation, C$^3$TG selectively pairs the LLM with the required attribute classifiers from the 17 available dimensions and employs weighted KL-divergence to adjust token probabilities. The optimization phase then leverages an energy function combining classifier scores and penalty terms to resolve attribute conflicts through iterative feedback, enabling precise control over multiple dimensions simultaneously while preserving natural text flow. Experiments show that C$^3$TG significantly outperforms baselines across multiple metrics including attribute accuracy, linguistic fluency, and output diversity, while simultaneously reducing toxicity. These results establish C$^3$TG as an effective and flexible solution for multi-dimensional text attribute control that requires no costly model modifications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86C\u00b3TG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6587\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6a21\u578b\u4fee\u6539\u5373\u53ef\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u591a\u4e2a\u5c5e\u6027", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u591a\u4e2a\u6587\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\u51b2\u7a81\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u534f\u8c03\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u5c11\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u751f\u6210\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u5c5e\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548c\u52a0\u6743KL\u6563\u5ea6\u8c03\u6574token\u6982\u7387\uff1b\u4f18\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u80fd\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5206\u6570\u548c\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\u89e3\u51b3\u5c5e\u6027\u51b2\u7a81", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5c5e\u6027\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u6bd2\u6027", "conclusion": "C\u00b3TG\u662f\u65e0\u9700\u6a21\u578b\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u6587\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

However, these models are often trained over a dataset that considers varying personal tastes as a monolith. To facilitate developing personalized creative writing LLMs, we introduce LiteraryTaste, a dataset of reading preferences from 60 people, where each person: 1) self-reported their reading habits and tastes (stated preference), and 2) annotated their preferences over 100 pairs of short creative writing texts (revealed preference). With our dataset, we found that: 1) people diverge on creative writing preferences, 2) finetuning a transformer encoder could achieve 75.8% and 67.7% accuracy when modeling personal and collective revealed preferences, and 3) stated preferences had limited utility in modeling revealed preferences.

However, existing approaches exhibit several limitations:(1)they primarily rely on static kernels to augment feature information, lacking adaptive mechanisms to extract features at varying resolutions dynamically;(2)temporal guidance is insufficient, leading to suboptimal modeling of long-range spatiotemporal dependencies; and(3)the quadratic computational cost of attention mechanisms is often overlooked, limiting efficiency in practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose USF-Net, a Unified Spatiotemporal Fusion Network that integrates adaptive large-kernel convolutions and a low-complexity attention mechanism, combining temporal flow information within an encoder-decoder framework. Specifically, the encoder employs three basic layers to extract features. Followed by the USTM, which comprises:(1)a SiB equipped with a SSM that dynamically captures multi-scale contextual information, and(2)a TiB featuring a TAM that effectively models long-range temporal dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. In addition, a DSM with a TGM is introduced to enable unified modeling of temporally guided spatiotemporal dependencies. On the decoder side, a DUM is employed to address the common \"ghosting effect.\" It utilizes the initial temporal state as an attention operator to preserve critical motion signatures. As a key contribution, we also introduce and release the ASI-CIS dataset. Extensive experiments on ASI-CIS demonstrate that USF-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing a superior balance between prediction accuracy and computational efficiency for ground-based cloud extrapolation.

While recent video generation models produce realistic visual sequences, they typically operate in the prompt-to-full-video manner without causal control, interactivity, or long-horizon consistency required for purposeful reasoning. Existing world modeling efforts, on the other hand, often focus on restricted domains (e.g., physical, game, or 3D-scene dynamics) with limited depth and controllability, and struggle to generalize across diverse environments and interaction formats. In this work, we introduce PAN, a general, interactable, and long-horizon world model that predicts future world states through high-quality video simulation conditioned on history and natural language actions. PAN employs the Generative Latent Prediction (GLP) architecture that combines an autoregressive latent dynamics backbone based on a large language model (LLM), which grounds simulation in extensive text-based knowledge and enables conditioning on language-specified actions, with a video diffusion decoder that reconstructs perceptually detailed and temporally coherent visual observations, to achieve a unification between latent space reasoning (imagination) and realizable world dynamics (reality). Trained on large-scale video-action pairs spanning diverse domains, PAN supports open-domain, action-conditioned simulation with coherent, long-term dynamics. Extensive experiments show that PAN achieves strong performance in action-conditioned world simulation, long-horizon forecasting, and simulative reasoning compared to other video generators and world models, taking a step towards general world models that enable predictive simulation of future world states for reasoning and acting.", "AI": {"tldr": "PAN\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u62df\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u4e16\u754c\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u4e16\u754c\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u56e0\u679c\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u548c\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5f80\u5f80\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002\u9700\u8981\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u3001\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u52a8\u4f5c\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u751f\u6210\u6f5c\u5728\u9884\u6d4b(GLP)\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u56de\u5f52\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u9891-\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660ePAN\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548c\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "PAN\u671d\u7740\u901a\u7528\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u8fc8\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u884c\u52a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u672a\u6765\u4e16\u754c\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u62df\u3002"}}

Yet, these results fail to sufficiently distinguish true scientific reasoning articulation capabilities from pattern-matching. To address this gap, we introduce \\textbf{mmJEE-Eval}, a multimodal bilingual (English and Hindi) benchmark comprising 1,460 questions from India's JEE Advanced examination (2019-2025) spanning pre-college Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics domains. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art models reveals that while frontier VLMs (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash) achieve 77-84\\% accuracy on held-out 2025 questions, open-source models plateau at 37-45\\% despite scaling to 400B parameters, a significant difference not observed on existing benchmarks. While closed frontiers from Google and OpenAI show high problem-solving accuracies (up to 100\\% pass@3 scores), they fully collapse when the reasoning load is increased meta-cognitively (GPT-5 fixes just 5.2\\% errors). Systematic ablations show mmJEE-Eval's difficulty stems from complexity and reasoning depth rather than memorization.

This paper introduces VietMEAgent, a multimodal explainable framework engineered for Vietnamese cultural understanding. The method integrates a cultural object detection backbone with a structured program generation layer, yielding a pipeline in which answer prediction and explanation are tightly coupled.

Specifically, we utilize the rapid System 1 to compute the answer entropy for given queries. This score is then used to evaluate the potential of samples for scaling, enabling dynamic self-consistency under System 2. Benefiting from the advance and accurate estimation provided by System 1, the proposed method can reduce token usage while simultaneously achieving a significant decrease in latency through parallel generation.

Recent work, Test-Time Counterattack (TTC), improves robustness by generating perturbations that maximize the embedding deviation of adversarial inputs using PGD, pushing them away from their adversarial representations. However, due to the fundamental difference in optimization objectives between adversarial attacks and counterattacks, generating counterattacks solely based on gradients with respect to the adversarial input confines the search to a narrow space. As a result, the counterattacks could overfit limited adversarial patterns and lack the diversity to fully neutralize a broad range of perturbations. In this work, we argue that enhancing the diversity and coverage of counterattacks is crucial to improving adversarial robustness in test-time defense. Accordingly, we propose Directional Orthogonal Counterattack (DOC), which augments counterattack optimization by incorporating orthogonal gradient directions and momentum-based updates. This design expands the exploration of the counterattack space and increases the diversity of perturbations, which facilitates the discovery of more generalizable counterattacks and ultimately improves the ability to neutralize adversarial perturbations. Meanwhile, we present a directional sensitivity score based on averaged cosine similarity to boost DOC by improving example discrimination and adaptively modulating the counterattack strength. Extensive experiments on 16 datasets demonstrate that DOC improves adversarial robustness under various attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

Nonetheless, real-world data continually emerges, with possible compositions being nearly infinite, long-tailed, and not entirely visible. Thus, an ideal model is supposed to gradually improve the capability of compositional generalization in an incremental manner. In this paper, we explore Composition-Incremental Learning for Compositional Generalization (CompIL) in the context of the compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) task, where models need to continually learn new compositions, intending to improve their compositional generalization capability progressively.

However, under domain shift, they suffer from feature drift, class-prior mismatch, and severe miscalibration. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often require backpropagation through large backbones, covariance estimation, or heavy memory/state, which is problematic for streaming and edge scenarios. We propose Ultra-Light Test-Time Adaptation (UL-TTA), a fully training-free and backprop-free framework that freezes the backbone and adapts only logit-level parameters: class prototypes, class priors, and temperature. UL-TTA performs an online EM-style procedure with (i) selective sample filtering to use only confident predictions, (ii) closed-form Bayesian updates for prototypes and priors anchored by text and Dirichlet priors, (iii) decoupled temperatures for prediction vs. calibration, and (iv) lightweight guards (norm clipping, prior KL constraints, smoothed temperature) to prevent drift in long streams. Across large-scale cross-domain and OOD benchmarks (PACS, Office-Home, DomainNet, Terra Incognita, ImageNet-R/A/V2/Sketch; ~726K test samples) and strong TTA baselines including Tent, T3A, CoTTA, SAR, Tip-Adapter, and FreeTTA, UL-TTA consistently improves top-1 accuracy (e.g., +4.7 points over zero-shot CLIP on average) while reducing ECE by 20-30%, with less than 8% latency overhead. Long-stream experiments up to 200K samples show no collapse.

To resolve this dilemma, we propose Adaptive Margin-attached Preference Optimization (AMaPO), a simple yet principled algorithm. AMaPO employs an instance-wise adaptive margin, refined by Z-normalization and exponential scaling, which dynamically reallocates learning effort by amplifying gradients for misranked samples and suppressing them for correct ones. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that AMaPO not only achieves better ranking accuracy and superior downstream alignment performance, but targeted analysis also confirms that it successfully mitigates the core overfitting and underfitting issues.", "AI": {"tldr": "AMaPO\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fb9\u754c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u79bb\u7ebf\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408-\u6b20\u62df\u5408\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6392\u5e8f\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u79bb\u7ebf\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u62df\u5408-\u6b20\u62df\u5408\u56f0\u5883\uff1a\u5bf9\u6b63\u786e\u6392\u5e8f\u6837\u672c\u65bd\u52a0\u8fc7\u591a\u68af\u5ea6\uff08\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff09\uff0c\u5bf9\u9519\u8bef\u6392\u5e8f\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0d\u8db3\u4fee\u6b63\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u6b20\u62df\u5408\uff09\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6392\u5e8f\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u63d0\u5347", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fb9\u754c\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316(AMaPO)\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eZ\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u548c\u6307\u6570\u7f29\u653e\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u5b66\u4e60\u52aa\u529b\uff1a\u653e\u5927\u9519\u8bef\u6392\u5e8f\u6837\u672c\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u6b63\u786e\u6392\u5e8f\u6837\u672c\u7684\u68af\u5ea6", "result": "\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cAMaPO\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u6210\u529f\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u6b20\u62df\u5408\u95ee\u9898", "conclusion": "AMaPO\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fb9\u754c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u79bb\u7ebf\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408-\u6b20\u62df\u5408\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Integrating physics-informed constraints with data-driven learning, PIFF captures the causal relationships between rainfall, topography, SPM, and flooding, replacing costly simulations with accurate, real-time flood maps.

Consequently, there is a need for a robust and unified benchmark to assess the counseling competence of various LLMs. Existing works, however, are limited by unprofessional client simulation, static question-and-answer evaluation formats, and unidimensional metrics. These limitations hinder their effectiveness in assessing a model's comprehensive ability to handle diverse and complex clients. To address this gap, we introduce \\textbf{CARE-Bench}, a dynamic and interactive automated benchmark.

Traditional vision-based HMR methods sometimes face limitations in real-world scenarios due to mutual occlusions, insufficient lighting, and privacy concerns. Human-floor tactile interactions offer an occlusion-free and privacy-friendly alternative for capturing human motion. Existing research indicates that pressure signals acquired from tactile mats can effectively estimate human pose in single-person scenarios. However, when multiple individuals walk randomly on the mat simultaneously, how to distinguish intermingled pressure signals generated by different persons and subsequently acquire individual temporal pressure data remains a pending challenge for extending pressure-based HMR to the multi-person situation. In this paper, we present \\textbf{PressTrack-HMR}, a top-down pipeline that recovers multi-person global human meshes solely from pressure signals. This pipeline leverages a tracking-by-detection strategy to first identify and segment each individual's pressure signal from the raw pressure data, and subsequently performs HMR for each extracted individual signal. Furthermore, we build a multi-person interaction pressure dataset \\textbf{MIP}, which facilitates further research into pressure-based human motion analysis in multi-person scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in multi-person HMR using pressure data, with 89.2~$mm$ MPJPE and 112.6~$mm$ WA-MPJPE$_{100}$, and these showcase the potential of tactile mats for ubiquitous, privacy-preserving multi-person action recognition.

We show that our dataset enables fine-tuned models to automatically extract information relevant for downstream tasks ranging from knowledge graph (KG) construction, to monitoring the computational reproducibility of AI research at scale. Additionally, we use our dataset as a test suite to explore prompting strategies for IE using Large Language Models (LLM). We observe that the performance of state-of-the-art LLM prompting methods is largely outperformed by our best fine-tuned baseline model (NER: 80.6%, RE: 54.0% for the fine-tuned model vs. NER: 44.4%, RE: 10.1% for the LLM).

Leveraging an octree-based transformer, our approach extracts hierarchical local descriptors at multiple granularities to increase robustness to clutter, self-similarity, and viewpoint changes in challenging scenarios, including ground-to-ground and ground-to-aerial in forest and urban environments. We propose a learnable multi-scale geometric verification module to reduce re-ranking failures in the presence of degraded single-scale correspondences. Our coarse-to-fine registration approach achieves comparable or lower localisation errors to baselines, with runtime improvements of two orders of magnitude over RANSAC for dense point clouds.

Existing detectors rely mainly on pixel-level visual cues and generalize poorly to unseen generators. We propose DBINDS, a diffusion-model-inversion based detector that analyzes latent-space dynamics rather than pixels. We find that initial noise sequences recovered by diffusion inversion differ systematically between real and generated videos. Building on this, DBINDS forms an Initial Noise Difference Sequence (INDS) and extracts multi-domain, multi-scale features.

To help making texts more readable and make information more accessible to everyone, a line of researched aims at making texts accessible for their target audience: automatic text simplification (ATS). Lately, there have been studies on the correlations between automatic evaluation metrics in ATS and human judgment. However, the correlations between those two aspects and commonly available readability measures (such as readability formulas or linguistic features) have not been the focus of as much attention. In this work, we investigate the place of readability measures in ATS by complementing the existing studies on evaluation metrics and human judgment, on English. We first discuss the relationship between ATS and research in readability, then we report a study on correlations between readability measures and human judgment, and between readability measures and ATS evaluation metrics. We identify that in general, readability measures do not correlate well with automatic metrics and human judgment.

However, reliable evaluation remains the primary bottleneck for responsible clinical deployment. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines DermBench, a meticulously curated benchmark, with DermEval, a robust automatic evaluator, to enable clinically meaningful, reproducible, and scalable assessment. We build DermBench, which pairs 4,000 real-world dermatology images with expert-certified diagnostic narratives and uses an LLM-based judge to score candidate narratives across clinically grounded dimensions, enabling consistent and comprehensive evaluation of multimodal models. For individual case assessment, we train DermEval, a reference-free multimodal evaluator. Given an image and a generated narrative, DermEval produces a structured critique along with an overall score and per-dimension ratings. This capability enables fine-grained, per-case analysis, which is critical for identifying model limitations and biases. Experiments on a diverse dataset of 4,500 cases demonstrate that DermBench and DermEval achieve close alignment with expert ratings, with mean deviations of 0.251 and 0.117 (out of 5), respectively, providing reliable measurement of diagnostic ability and trustworthiness across different multimodal LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DermBench\u548cDermEval\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57284500\u4e2a\u75c5\u4f8b\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u8bc4\u4f30\u662f\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e34\u5e8a\u610f\u4e49\u660e\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaDermBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff084000\u5f20\u771f\u5b9e\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u56fe\u50cf+\u4e13\u5bb6\u8ba4\u8bc1\u8bca\u65ad\u53d9\u8ff0\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u8bc4\u5206\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3DermEval\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bc4\u4ef7\u548c\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u57284500\u4e2a\u75c5\u4f8b\u4e0a\uff0cDermBench\u548cDermEval\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u504f\u5dee\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.251\u548c0.117\uff08\u6ee1\u52065\u5206\uff09\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u53ef\u9760\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0d\u540c\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u610f\u4e49\u660e\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u548c\u504f\u89c1\u3002"}}

We propose a novel understanding framework for gradient-based attribution from an information-theoretic perspective. We prove that, under mild conditions, the Vector-Jacobian Products (VJP) computed during backpropagation form minimal sufficient statistics of input features with respect to class labels. Motivated by this finding, we propose an encoding-decoding perspective : forward propagation encodes inputs into class space, while VJP in backpropagation decodes this encoding back to feature space. Therefore, we propose Spatial Information Bottleneck (S-IB) to spatially disentangle information flow. By maximizing mutual information between foreground VJP and inputs while minimizing mutual information in background regions, S-IB encourages networks to encode information only in class-relevant spatial regions. Since post-hoc explanation methods fundamentally derive from VJP computations, directly optimizing VJP's spatial structure during training improves visualization quality across diverse explanation paradigms. Experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate universal improvements across six explanation methods, achieving better foreground concentration and background suppression without method-specific tuning, alongside consistent classification accuracy gains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888(S-IB)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u89d2\u5ea6\u7406\u89e3\u68af\u5ea6\u5f52\u56e0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u4e2d\u7684\u5411\u91cf-\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u79ef(VJP)\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u901a\u5e38\u5b66\u4e60\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5c06\u5224\u522b\u6027\u524d\u666f\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u865a\u5047\u80cc\u666f\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6df7\u5728\u4e00\u8d77\uff0c\u524a\u5f31\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u89d2\u5ea6\u8bc1\u660eVJP\u6784\u6210\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u5173\u4e8e\u7c7b\u522b\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5145\u5206\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7f16\u7801-\u89e3\u7801\u89c6\u89d2\uff1a\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u7f16\u7801\u5230\u7c7b\u522b\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u4e2d\u7684VJP\u5c06\u6b64\u7f16\u7801\u89e3\u7801\u56de\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316\u524d\u666fVJP\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u80cc\u666f\u533a\u57df\u7684\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u89e3\u8026\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u516d\u79cd\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u666e\u904d\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u524d\u666f\u96c6\u4e2d\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u6291\u5236\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u65b9\u6cd5\u7279\u5b9a\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u83b7\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "S-IB\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4VJP\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u89e3\u91ca\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u68af\u5ea6\u5f52\u56e0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

However, deploying its intricate decoder on resource and power-constrained edge devices presents challenges due to numerous parameters, the inflexibility to adapt to dynamically evolving algorithms, and the high power consumption induced by extensive computations and data transmission. This paper for the first time proposes a novel field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)-oriented AGC deployment scheme for edge-computing video services. Initially, we analyze the AGC algorithm and employ network compression methods including post-training static quantization and layer fusion techniques. Subsequently, we design an overlapped accelerator utilizing the co-processor paradigm to perform computations through software-hardware co-design. The hardware processing unit comprises engines such as convolution, grid sampling, upsample, etc. Parallelization optimization strategies like double-buffered pipelines and loop unrolling are employed to fully exploit the resources of FPGA. Ultimately, we establish an AGC FPGA prototype on the PYNQ-Z1 platform using the proposed scheme, achieving \\textbf{24.9$\\times$} and \\textbf{4.1$\\times$} higher energy efficiency against commercial Central Processing Unit (CPU) and Graphic Processing Unit (GPU), respectively.

The few existing deep learning approaches rarely disentangle the role of neural architecture from that of signal choice. In this work, we systematically evaluate both aspects. We compare classical baselines with newer neural architectures across single signals, signal pairs, and grouped sensor inputs for diverse physical activities. Our results show that minute ventilation is the most predictive individual signal, with a transformer model achieving the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.87 W/kg across all activities. Paired and grouped signals, such as those from the Hexoskin smart shirt (five signals), offer good alternatives for faster models like CNN and ResNet with attention. Per-activity evaluation revealed mixed outcomes: notably better results in low-intensity activities (RMSE down to 0.29 W/kg; NRMSE = 0.04), while higher-intensity tasks showed larger RMSE but more comparable normalized errors.

However, most existing approaches lack knowledge diversity, as they rely solely on unimodal visual information, overlooking the potential of cross-modal representations. In this work, we explore the use of CLIP's vision-language knowledge as a complementary source of supervision for KD, an area that remains largely underexplored. We propose a simple yet effective framework that fuses the logits and features of a conventional teacher with those from CLIP. By incorporating CLIP's multi-prompt textual guidance, the fused supervision captures both dataset-specific and semantically enriched visual cues. Beyond accuracy, analysis shows that the fused teacher yields more confident and reliable predictions, significantly increasing confident-correct cases while reducing confidently wrong ones.

Starting from coarse voxel grids produced by Trellis, we interpret these as continuous density fields to optimize and introduce three differentiable, physically constrained, and simulation-free loss terms. Additionally, a mass regularization penalizes unnecessary material, while a restricted optimization domain preserves the outer surface. Our method seamlessly integrates with pretrained Trellis-based models (e.g., Trellis, DSO) without any architectural changes. In extensive evaluations, we achieve up to 43% reduction in material mass on the text-to-3D task.

When applied to medical image segmentation, the paradigm faces challenges due to inherent image ambiguities, making it particularly vulnerable to erroneous supervision. Crucially, the student's iterative reconfirmation of these errors leads to self-reinforcing bias. While some studies attempt to mitigate this bias, they often rely on external modifications to the conventional teacher-student framework, overlooking its intrinsic potential for error correction. In response, this work introduces a feedback mechanism into the teacher-student framework to counteract error reconfirmations. Here, the student provides feedback on the changes induced by the teacher's pseudo-labels, enabling the teacher to refine these labels accordingly. We specify that this interaction hinges on two key components: the feedback attributor, which designates pseudo-labels triggering the student's update, and the feedback receiver, which determines where to apply this feedback. Building on this, a dual-teacher feedback model is further proposed, which allows more dynamics in the feedback loop and fosters more gains by resolving disagreements through cross-teacher supervision while avoiding consistent errors.

PETR and its variants (PETRs) excel in benchmarks but face deployment challenges due to high computational cost and memory footprint. Quantization is an effective technique for compressing deep neural networks by reducing the bit width of weights and activations. However, directly applying existing quantization methods to PETRs leads to severe accuracy degradation. This issue primarily arises from two key challenges: (1) significant magnitude disparity between multi-modal features-specifically, image features and camera-ray positional embeddings (PE), and (2) the inefficiency and approximation error of quantizing non-linear operators, which commonly rely on hardware-unfriendly computations. In this paper, we propose FQ-PETR, a fully quantized framework for PETRs, featuring three key innovations: (1) Quantization-Friendly LiDAR-ray Position Embedding (QFPE): Replacing multi-point sampling with LiDAR-prior-guided single-point sampling and anchor-based embedding eliminates problematic non-linearities (e.g., inverse-sigmoid) and aligns PE scale with image features, preserving accuracy.

Moving IRSTD still remains highly challenging due to weak target features and complex background interference. Accurate spatio-temporal feature modeling is crucial for moving target detection, typically achieved through either temporal differences or spatio-temporal (3D) convolutions. Temporal difference can explicitly leverage motion cues but exhibits limited capability in extracting spatial features, whereas 3D convolution effectively represents spatio-temporal features yet lacks explicit awareness of motion dynamics along the temporal dimension. In this paper, we propose a novel moving IRSTD network (TDCNet), which effectively extracts and enhances spatio-temporal features for accurate target detection. Specifically, we introduce a novel temporal difference convolution (TDC) re-parameterization module that comprises three parallel TDC blocks designed to capture contextual dependencies across different temporal ranges. Each TDC block fuses temporal difference and 3D convolution into a unified spatio-temporal convolution representation. This re-parameterized module can effectively capture multi-scale motion contextual features while suppressing pseudo-motion clutter in complex backgrounds, significantly improving detection performance. Moreover, we propose a TDC-guided spatio-temporal attention mechanism that performs cross-attention between the spatio-temporal features from the TDC-based backbone and a parallel 3D backbone. This mechanism models their global semantic dependencies to refine the current frame's features. Extensive experiments on IRSTD-UAV and public infrared datasets demonstrate that our TDCNet achieves state-of-the-art detection performance in moving target detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTDCNet\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\u5206\u5377\u79ef\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408TDC\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u7ea2\u5916\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u79fb\u52a8\u7ea2\u5916\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u7279\u5f81\u5f31\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u5e72\u6270\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u4ecd\u7136\u6781\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\u5206\u80fd\u663e\u5f0f\u5229\u7528\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ebf\u7d22\u4f46\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c3D\u5377\u79ef\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8868\u793a\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u5f81\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8fd0\u52a8\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTDCNet\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5305\u542b\uff1a1\uff09\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\u5206\u5377\u79ef\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5e76\u884cTDC\u5757\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\u5206\u548c3D\u5377\u79ef\uff1b2\uff09TDC\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u4e8eTDC\u7684\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u5e76\u884c3D\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u4e4b\u95f4\u6267\u884c\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728IRSTD-UAV\u548c\u516c\u5171\u7ea2\u5916\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTDCNet\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "TDCNet\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u79fb\u52a8\u7ea2\u5916\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Preprint, under review for Eurographics 2026", "summary": "Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved state-of-the-art results for novel view synthesis. However, efficiently capturing high-fidelity reconstructions of specific objects within complex scenes remains a significant challenge. A key limitation of existing active reconstruction methods is their reliance on scene-level uncertainty metrics, which are often biased by irrelevant background clutter and lead to inefficient view selection for object-centric tasks. We present OUGS, a novel framework that addresses this challenge with a more principled, physically-grounded uncertainty formulation for 3DGS. Our core innovation is to derive uncertainty directly from the explicit physical parameters of the 3D Gaussian primitives (e.g., position, scale, rotation). By propagating the covariance of these parameters through the rendering Jacobian, we establish a highly interpretable uncertainty model. This foundation allows us to then seamlessly integrate semantic segmentation masks to produce a targeted, object-aware uncertainty score that effectively disentangles the object from its environment. This allows for a more effective active view selection strategy that prioritizes views critical to improving object fidelity.

Existing vision-based methods often fail to generalize across domains and patients, leading to residual alignment errors. This work establishes a generalizable foundation for bronchoscopy navigation through a robust vision-based framework and a new synthetic benchmark dataset that enables standardized and reproducible evaluation. We propose a vision-based pose optimization framework for frame-wise 2D-3D registration between intra-operative endoscopic views and pre-operative CT anatomy. A fine-tuned modality- and domain-invariant encoder enables direct similarity computation between real endoscopic RGB frames and CT-rendered depth maps, while a differentiable rendering module iteratively refines camera poses through depth consistency. To enhance reproducibility, we introduce the first public synthetic benchmark dataset for bronchoscopy navigation, addressing the lack of paired CT-endoscopy data. Trained exclusively on synthetic data distinct from the benchmark, our model achieves an average translational error of 2.65 mm and a rotational error of 0.19 rad, demonstrating accurate and stable localization. Qualitative results on real patient data further confirm strong cross-domain generalization, achieving consistent frame-wise 2D-3D alignment without domain-specific adaptation.

To address this gap, we constructed the first dedicated detection and tracking dataset for the American football players and conducted a comparative evaluation of various detection and tracking methods.

However, most existing methods rely solely on geometric cues and predict each 3D pose independently, which limits their ability to resolve ambiguous motions and generalize to real-world scenarios. Inspired by how humans understand and anticipate motion, we introduce DreamPose3D, a diffusion-based framework that combines action-aware reasoning with temporal imagination for 3D pose estimation. DreamPose3D dynamically conditions the denoising process using task-relevant action prompts extracted from 2D pose sequences, capturing high-level intent. To model the structural relationships between joints effectively, we introduce a representation encoder that incorporates kinematic joint affinity into the attention mechanism. Finally, a hallucinative pose decoder predicts temporally coherent 3D pose sequences during training, simulating how humans mentally reconstruct motion trajectories to resolve ambiguity in perception. Extensive experiments on benchmarked Human3.6M and MPI-3DHP datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all metrics. To further validate DreamPose3D's robustness, we tested it on a broadcast baseball dataset, where it demonstrated strong performance despite ambiguous and noisy 2D inputs, effectively handling temporal consistency and intent-driven motion variations.", "AI": {"tldr": "DreamPose3D\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u76843D\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u4f5c\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u60f3\u8c61\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u4f5c\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u5173\u8282\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u59ff\u6001\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u51e0\u4f55\u7ebf\u7d22\u5e76\u72ec\u7acb\u9884\u6d4b\u6bcf\u4e2a3D\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u7cca\u8fd0\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e5f\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u3002\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u8fd0\u52a8\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u5c42\u610f\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece2D\u59ff\u6001\u5e8f\u5217\u63d0\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u52a8\u4f5c\u63d0\u793a\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5305\u542b\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u5173\u8282\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u7684\u8868\u793a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u5e7b\u89c9\u59ff\u6001\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u76843D\u59ff\u6001\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u5728Human3.6M\u548cMPI-3DHP\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5728\u5e7f\u64ad\u68d2\u7403\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u566a\u58f02D\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u610f\u56fe\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "DreamPose3D\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u4f5c\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u60f3\u8c61\u529b\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5173\u7cfb\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u7cca\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

However, prompt learning in this context is challenged by semantic misalignment between LLMs and CLIP variants due to divergent training corpora and model architectures; it further lacks scalability across continuously evolving families of foundation models. More critically, pairwise multimodal alignment via conventional Euclidean-space optimization lacks the capacity to model unified representations or apply localized geometric constraints, which tends to amplify modality gaps in complex biomedical imaging and destabilize few-shot adaptation. In this work, we propose vMFCoOp, a framework that inversely estimates von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions on a shared Hyperspherical Manifold, aligning semantic biases between arbitrary LLMs and CLIP backbones via Unified Semantic Anchors to achieve robust biomedical prompting and superior few-shot classification. Grounded in three complementary constraints, vMFCoOp demonstrates consistent improvements across 14 medical datasets, 12 medical imaging modalities, and 13 anatomical regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, generalization, and clinical applicability.

Rather than simply fine-tuning a heavy-weight vision-language model (VLM) for new domains, we introduce RF-DETR, a light-weight specialist detection transformer that discovers accuracy-latency Pareto curves for any target dataset with weight-sharing neural architecture search (NAS). Our approach fine-tunes a pre-trained base network on a target dataset and evaluates thousands of network configurations with different accuracy-latency tradeoffs without re-training. Further, we revisit the \"tunable knobs\" for NAS to improve the transferability of DETRs to diverse target domains. Notably, RF-DETR significantly improves on prior state-of-the-art real-time methods on COCO and Roboflow100-VL. RF-DETR (nano) achieves 48.0 AP on COCO, beating D-FINE (nano) by 5.3 AP at similar latency, and RF-DETR (2x-large) outperforms GroundingDINO (tiny) by 1.2 AP on Roboflow100-VL while running 20x as fast.
