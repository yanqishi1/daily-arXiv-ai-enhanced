TL;DR: LLMs在逻辑谜题上表现脆弱，主要依赖记忆而非真正推理。当谜题被轻微修改时，模型性能急剧下降，出现'幻影回忆'现象——自信地复述记忆中的解决方案而非重新推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在逻辑谜题上的推理能力是否真实，以及它们对谜题微小变化的脆弱性。探索模型是否真正理解逻辑结构还是仅依赖记忆模板。

Method: 引入PHANTOM RECALL基准，包含25个经典逻辑谜题和149个精心设计的扰动版本。评估11个领先LLMs，开发自动化逻辑等价判断器、细粒度推理错误分类法和基于提示的缓解框架。

Result: 在未修改谜题上准确率接近完美，但在扰动谜题上表现显著低于人类水平。模型出现幻影回忆和过度阐述问题，无法在上下文线索变化时重新推理。

Conclusion: LLMs在语言流畅性和逻辑理解之间存在显著差距，当情境变化时往往无法进行真正的推理，而是依赖记忆的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, Gemini, and Claude often appear
adept at solving classic logic puzzles--but how much genuine reasoning
underlies their answers? Recent evidence suggests that these models frequently
rely on memorized templates rather than reasoning from first principles. When
puzzles are slightly modified, their performance collapses, revealing a
striking fragility. In particular, we asked: Have LLMs addressed these issues?
To what extent? How about perturbations to other puzzles? Is there a general
way of reformulating the prompt so that the models do better? To examine these
things systematically, we introduce PHANTOM RECALL, a benchmark comprising 25
well-known logic puzzles and 149 carefully designed perturbations that preserve
reasoning structure but alter superficial details and solutions. We evaluate
eleven leading LLMs and identify a recurring failure mode--phantom
recall--where models confidently reproduce memorized solutions or spurious
rationales that no longer fit the altered scenario. To probe and mitigate this
issue, we contribute three tools: (i) an automated logical-equivalence judge to
detect reasoning mismatches, (ii) a taxonomy of fine-grained reasoning error
categories, and (iii) a prompting-based mitigation framework guided by these
categories. Despite near-perfect accuracy on unmodified puzzles, models
significantly underperform humans on perturbed ones, exhibiting both phantom
recall and over-elaboration. Our findings reveal a crucial limitation: LLMs
often fail to re-reason when contextual cues shift--highlighting the gap
between linguistic fluency and logical understanding.

TL;DR: LLMs作为世界模型存在幻觉和长期模拟能力不足的问题，提出的R-WoM通过检索增强方法显著提升了决策性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用LLMs作为世界模型来增强智能体决策，但面临幻觉问题和长期模拟能力不足的挑战。

Method: 提出检索增强世界模型(R-WoM)，通过从外部教程检索事实性知识来增强LLM的模拟能力。

Result: R-WoM在OSWorld和WebArena上分别实现了25.3%和18.1%的性能提升，在长期模拟中表现尤其突出。

Conclusion: LLMs在短期状态预测方面有效，但长期模拟能力有限；检索增强方法能显著提升世界建模性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as world models to enhance agent
decision-making in digital environments by simulating future states and
predicting action outcomes, potentially eliminating costly trial-and-error
exploration. However, this capability is fundamentally limited by LLMs'
tendency toward hallucination and their reliance on static training knowledge,
which can lead to compounding errors that inhibit long-horizon simulations. To
systematically investigate whether LLMs are appropriate for world modeling, we
probe two core capabilities of world models--future state prediction and reward
estimation--through three tasks: next-state identification, full-procedure
planning alignment, and milestone transition recognition. Our analysis shows
that while LLMs effectively capture immediate next states and identify
meaningful state transitions, their performance rapidly degrades in
full-procedure planning. This highlights LLMs' limitations in reliably modeling
environment dynamics over long horizons. To address these limitations, we
propose the Retrieval-augmented World Model (R-WoM), which grounds LLM
simulations by incorporating factual, up-to-date knowledge retrieved from
external tutorials. Experiments show that R-WoM achieves substantial
improvements of up to 25.3% (OSWorld) and 18.1% (WebArena) compared to
baselines, with particular advantages in longer-horizon simulations.

### [3] [LLM Knowledge is Brittle: Truthfulness Representations Rely on Superficial Resemblance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11905)
*Patrick Haller,Mark Ibrahim,Polina Kirichenko,Levent Sagun,Samuel J. Bell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM内部知识表示的不稳定性导致模型对输入微小变化过度敏感，真实陈述与虚假陈述的可分离性在语义保持的扰动下会崩溃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM性能脆弱性是否源于不稳定的内部知识表示，以及这种脆弱性如何影响模型在分布外场景下的表现。

Method: 通过应用语义保持的扰动（如拼写错误、重新表述）使样本分布外，评估四种LLM家族、五个评估数据集和三种知识探测方法中表示可分离性的退化情况。

Result: 当样本呈现方式与预训练数据差异增大时，LLM内部真实陈述表示的可分离性会崩溃，模型区分真假陈述的能力高度依赖表面形式。

Conclusion: LLM可能学习到浅层、非鲁棒的知识表示，这解释了基准测试性能的脆弱性，并对真实性探测的实用性提出了根本挑战。

Abstract: For Large Language Models (LLMs) to be reliable, they must learn robust
knowledge that can be generally applied in diverse settings -- often unlike
those seen during training. Yet, extensive research has shown that LLM
performance can be brittle, with models exhibiting excessive sensitivity to
trivial input variations. In this work, we explore whether this brittleness is
a direct result of unstable internal knowledge representations. To explore this
question, we build on previous work showing that LLM representations encode
statement truthfulness -- i.e., true, factual statements can be easily
separated from false, inaccurate ones. Specifically, we test the robustness of
learned knowledge by evaluating representation separability on samples that
have undergone superficial transformations to drive them out-of-distribution
(OOD), such as typos or reformulations. By applying semantically-preserving
perturbations, we study how separability degrades as statements become more
OOD, across four LLM families, five evaluation datasets, and three knowledge
probing methods. Our results reveal that internal representations of statement
truthfulness collapse as the samples' presentations become less similar to
those seen during pre-training. While LLMs can often distinguish between true
and false statements when they closely resemble the pre-training data, this
ability is highly dependent on the statement's exact surface form. These
findings offer a possible explanation for brittle benchmark performance: LLMs
may learn shallow, non-robust knowledge representations that allow for only
limited generalizability. Our work presents a fundamental challenge for the
utility of truthfulness probes, and more broadly, calls for further research on
improving the robustness of learned knowledge representations.

### [4] [LLM Reasoning for Machine Translation: Synthetic Data Generation over Thinking Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11919)
*Armel Zebaze,Rachel Bawden,Benoît Sagot*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型推理模型在机器翻译任务中生成中间思考标记（thinking tokens）并不能提升翻译性能，即使通过蒸馏思维链进行微调也无改善。但通过模块化翻译策略构建中间标记能带来提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型推理模型在机器翻译任务中使用中间思考标记的潜在益处，特别是在不同资源水平的语言对中。

Method: 在多个语言对和设置下测试中间标记生成效果，包括使用蒸馏思维链进行微调，以及构建模块化翻译策略的中间标记。

Result: 思考标记不能帮助LRMs更好地执行机器翻译，基于人类翻译实践的思维链蒸馏微调也不优于标准输入输出微调。但模块化翻译策略的中间标记能带来改进。

Conclusion: 中间标记在微调中的贡献高度依赖于其中是否包含翻译尝试，使用教师模型精炼目标翻译或扩展平行语料比蒸馏思维链解释更有效。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have led to new possibilities in terms of
problem-solving, through the devising of a natural language thought process
prior to answering a query. While their capabilities are well known across
mathematics and coding tasks, their impact on the task of machine translation
(MT) remains underexplored. In this work, we explore the benefits of the
generation of intermediate tokens when performing MT across multiple language
pairs of different levels of resourcedness and multiple setups. We find that
"thinking tokens" do not help LRMs better perform MT. This result generalizes
to models fine-tuned to reason before translating using distilled chain of
thought (CoT) inspired by human translators' practices. Specifically,
fine-tuning a model with synthetic CoT explanations detailing how to translate
step-by-step does not outperform standard input-output fine-tuning. However,
constructing the intermediate tokens by combining the outputs of modular
translation-specific prompting strategies results in improvements. Our findings
underscore that the contribution of intermediate tokens during fine-tuning
highly depends on the presence of translation attempts within them. More
broadly, our results suggest that using a teacher to refine target translations
or to expand parallel corpora is more impactful than distilling their CoT
explanations into "thinking" MT models.

### [5] [Discrepancy Detection at the Data Level: Toward Consistent Multilingual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11928)
*Lorena Calvo-Bartolomé,Valérie Aldana,Karla Cantarero,Alonso Madroñal de Mesa,Jerónimo Arenas-García,Jordan Boyd-Graber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MIND是一个用户参与的事实检查流程，用于检测多语言问答知识库中的事实和文化差异，特别关注文化敏感问题在不同地区的回答差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言问答系统需要确保跨语言的事实一致性，同时考虑主观回答中的文化差异，特别是在文化敏感问题上。

Method: 提出MIND用户参与的事实检查流程，在母婴健康领域的双语问答系统上进行评估，并发布带有事实和文化不一致标注的双语问题数据集。

Result: MIND在所有测试案例中都能可靠识别不一致性，支持开发更具文化意识和事实一致性的问答系统。

Conclusion: MIND能够有效检测多语言问答系统中的事实和文化不一致，有助于构建更准确、文化敏感的问答系统。

Abstract: Multilingual question answering (QA) systems must ensure factual consistency
across languages, especially for objective queries such as What is jaundice?,
while also accounting for cultural variation in subjective responses. We
propose MIND, a user-in-the-loop fact-checking pipeline to detect factual and
cultural discrepancies in multilingual QA knowledge bases. MIND highlights
divergent answers to culturally sensitive questions (e.g., Who assists in
childbirth?) that vary by region and context. We evaluate MIND on a bilingual
QA system in the maternal and infant health domain and release a dataset of
bilingual questions annotated for factual and cultural inconsistencies. We
further test MIND on datasets from other domains to assess generalization. In
all cases, MIND reliably identifies inconsistencies, supporting the development
of more culturally aware and factually consistent QA systems.

### [6] [TopoAlign: A Framework for Aligning Code to Math via Topological Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11944)
*Yupei Li,Philipp Borchert,Gerasimos Lampouras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TopoAlign框架利用代码仓库作为训练资源，通过将代码分解为文档字符串、主函数和依赖函数，并重新组装成结构上类似形式化数学语句的代码数据，从而提升数学大语言模型的自动形式化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数学大语言模型在自动形式化（将非形式化数学陈述转换为形式化陈述）方面表现不佳，主要受限于大规模语料库的稀缺，特别是包含非形式化和形式化陈述对的数据。虽然现有模型能够从自然语言指令生成代码，但代码与形式化数学之间的结构和语法差异限制了有效的迁移学习。

Method: 提出TopoAlign框架，将代码分解为文档字符串、主函数和依赖函数，然后重新组装这些组件，使其在结构上镜像形式化数学语句，从而生成结构对齐的代码数据用于训练数学大语言模型，无需额外的人工标注。

Result: 在DeepSeek-Math和Herald两个最先进模型上训练并评估，在minif2f、Putnam和ProofNet基准测试中取得显著提升。DeepSeek-Math在BEq@10上提升17.77%，在typecheck@10上提升68.82%；Herald在BEq@10上提升0.12%，在typecheck@10上提升1.09%。

Conclusion: 即使没有引入新的数学知识，训练结构对齐的代码数据对专业模型也有益，证明了TopoAlign框架的有效性，能够利用广泛可用的代码仓库作为数学大语言模型的训练资源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at both informal and formal (e.g. Lean 4)
mathematical reasoning but still struggle with autoformalisation, the task of
transforming informal into formal mathematical statements. Autoformalisation
helps pair the informal reasoning of LLMs with formal proof assistants which
enable machine-verifiable generation and mitigate hallucinations. Yet, the
performance of current Math LLMs is constrained by the scarcity of large-scale
corpora, particularly those containing pairs of informal and formal statements.
Although current models are trained to generate code from natural language
instructions, structural and syntactic differences between these and formal
mathematics limit effective transfer learning. We propose TopoAlign, a
framework that unlocks widely available code repositories as training resources
for Math LLMs. TopoAlign decomposes code into docstrings, main functions, and
dependency functions, and reassembles these components into analogues that
structurally mirror formal statements. This produces structurally aligned code
data that can be used for training Math LLMs without requiring additional human
annotation. We train two state-of-the-art models, DeepSeek-Math and Herald, and
evaluate them on the minif2f, Putnam, and ProofNet benchmarks. TopoAlign
provides substantial gains for DeepSeek-Math, improving performance by 17.77%
on BEq@10 and 68.82% on typecheck@10. Despite introducing no new mathematical
knowledge, our framework achieves gains of 0.12% and 1.09% for Herald on BEq@10
and typecheck@10, respectively, demonstrating that training on aligned code
data is beneficial even for specialized models.

### [7] [GRAVITY: A Framework for Personalized Text Generation via Profile-Grounded Synthetic Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11952)
*Priyanka Dey,Daniele Rosa,Wenqing Zheng,Daniel Barcklow,Jieyu Zhao,Emilio Ferrara*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GRAVITY框架通过生成基于用户画像的合成偏好数据来减少对人工标注的依赖，整合了人口统计、文化和心理维度，在跨文化个性化内容生成中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM个性化方法依赖昂贵的人工反馈或交互日志，难以扩展且忽略了深层用户属性，需要一种更可扩展的个性化方案。

Method: 整合Hofstede文化维度、Schwartz基本价值观、世界价值观调查和Big Five OCEAN人格特质等框架，生成基于用户画像的合成偏好数据对。

Result: 在400名亚马逊用户的书籍描述生成任务中，GRAVITY相比基线方法获得超过4%的偏好增益，用户研究显示86%的情况下更受青睐。

Conclusion: 基于场景的合成数据能够捕捉更丰富的用户差异，减少对昂贵标注的依赖，生成更具吸引力的用户中心内容，为LLM个性化提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: Personalization in LLMs often relies on costly human feedback or interaction
logs, limiting scalability and neglecting deeper user attributes. To reduce the
reliance on human annotations, we introduce GRAVITY (Generative Response with
Aligned Values, Interests, and Traits of You), a framework for generating
synthetic, profile-grounded preference data that captures users' interests,
values, beliefs, and personality traits. By integrating demographic, cultural,
and psychological frameworks -- including Hofstede's cultural dimensions,
Schwartz's basic values, the World Values Survey, and Big Five OCEAN traits --
GRAVITY synthesizes preference pairs to guide personalized content generation.
We evaluate GRAVITY on book descriptions for 400 Amazon users, comparing it to
prompt-based conditioning, standard fine-tuning, and naive synthetic pair
generation. Profile-grounded synthetic data consistently improves generation,
especially across multiple cultures (USA, Brazil, Japan, India), achieving over
4% higher preference gains across baselines, with user studies showing that
GRAVITY outputs are preferred over 86% of the time. Our results show that
scenario-grounded synthetic data can capture richer user variation, reduce
reliance on costly annotation, and produce more engaging, user-centered
content, offering a scalable path for LLM personalization.

### [8] [Evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems on Unanswerable, Uncheatable, Realistic, Multi-hop Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11956)
*Gabrielle Kaili-May Liu,Bryan Li,Arman Cohan,William Gantt Walden,Eugene Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了CRUMQs管道，用于自动创建不可作弊、真实、不可回答和多跳查询的RAG基准测试，显著提升了RAG系统评估的挑战性和真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG基准测试无法反映真实任务复杂性，多跳或超出范围的问题容易被作弊解决，限制了发现现有RAG系统局限性的能力。

Method: 开发了首个自动、难度可控的管道，用于创建不可作弊、真实、不可回答和多跳查询，可适应任何语料库和领域。

Result: 在两个流行的RAG数据集上创建CRUMQs，实验显示相比现有基准，CRUMQs对RAG系统极具挑战性，作弊分数降低高达81.0%。

Conclusion: 该管道提供了一种简单方法来增强基准测试难度和真实性，推动开发更强大的RAG系统。

Abstract: Real-world use cases often present RAG systems with complex queries for which
relevant information is missing from the corpus or is incomplete. In these
settings, RAG systems must be able to reject unanswerable, out-of-scope queries
and identify failures of retrieval and multi-hop reasoning. Despite this,
existing RAG benchmarks rarely reflect realistic task complexity for multi-hop
or out-of-scope questions, which often can be cheated via disconnected
reasoning (i.e., solved without genuine multi-hop inference) or require only
simple factual recall. This limits the ability for such benchmarks to uncover
limitations of existing RAG systems. To address this gap, we present the first
pipeline for automatic, difficulty-controlled creation of
un$\underline{c}$heatable, $\underline{r}$ealistic, $\underline{u}$nanswerable,
and $\underline{m}$ulti-hop $\underline{q}$uerie$\underline{s}$ (CRUMQs),
adaptable to any corpus and domain. We use our pipeline to create CRUMQs over
two popular RAG datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness via benchmark
experiments on leading retrieval-augmented LLMs. Results show that compared to
prior RAG benchmarks, CRUMQs are highly challenging for RAG systems and achieve
up to 81.0\% reduction in cheatability scores. More broadly, our pipeline
offers a simple way to enhance benchmark difficulty and realism and drive
development of more capable RAG systems.

### [9] [Direct Multi-Token Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11958)
*Xuan Luo,Weizhi Wang,Xifeng Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出直接多令牌解码（DMTD）方法，利用预训练LLM中不同层级的特定功能，通过仅使用后层生成多个令牌来加速推理，无需额外参数或验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于预训练LLM中早期、中间和后期层分别负责理解输入上下文、任务特定处理和生成输出的观察，假设隐藏状态已包含足够信息支持多令牌生成，无需重复遍历早期和中间层。

Method: 提出DMTD推理范式，仅使用后期层从处理后的隐藏状态直接生成多个令牌，不引入额外参数、辅助程序或后生成验证。

Result: 在有限数据集上微调的DMTD Qwen3-4B模型实现了高达2倍的加速，仅有轻微性能损失。缩放分析表明使用更大训练数据集可进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: DMTD是一种有效的推理加速方法，通过利用LLM层级特性实现多令牌生成，具有无需额外开销和良好扩展性的优势。

Abstract: Decoder-only transformers have become the standard architecture for large
language models (LLMs) due to their strong performance. Recent studies suggest
that, in pre-trained LLMs, early, middle, and late layers may serve distinct
roles: Early layers focus on understanding the input context, middle layers
handle task-specific processing, and late layers convert abstract
representations into output tokens. We hypothesize that once representations
have been processed by the early and middle layers, the resulting hidden states
may encapsulate sufficient information to support the generation of multiple
tokens using only the late layers, eliminating the need to repeatedly traverse
the early and middle layers. We refer to this inference paradigm as Direct
Multi-Token Decoding (DMTD). Unlike speculative decoding, our method introduces
no additional parameters, auxiliary routines, or post-generation verification.
Despite being trained on a limited dataset, a fine-tuned DMTD Qwen3-4B model
has already demonstrated promising results, achieving up to a 2x speedup with
only minor performance loss. Moreover, as shown in our scaling analysis, its
performance is expected to further improve with larger training datasets.

### [10] [Scaling Long-Horizon LLM Agent via Context-Folding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11967)
*Weiwei Sun,Miao Lu,Zhan Ling,Kang Liu,Xuesong Yao,Yiming Yang,Jiecao Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Context-Folding框架让LLM智能体能够主动管理工作上下文，通过子轨迹分支处理子任务并在完成后折叠中间步骤，仅保留结果摘要，从而显著减少上下文使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型智能体在长视野任务中受限于上下文长度，需要更有效的上下文管理方法。

Method: 提出Context-Folding框架，采用端到端强化学习FoldGRPO，通过过程奖励鼓励有效的任务分解和上下文管理。

Result: 在复杂长视野任务（Deep Research和SWE）上，折叠智能体匹配或超越ReAct基线，同时使用10倍更小的活动上下文，显著优于基于摘要的上下文管理模型。

Conclusion: Context-Folding框架为LLM智能体提供了有效的长视野任务处理能力，大幅减少了上下文需求。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are fundamentally constrained by context
length on long-horizon tasks. We introduce Context-Folding, a framework that
empowers agents to actively manage their working context. An agent can
procedurally branch into a sub-trajectory to handle a subtask and then fold it
upon completion, collapsing the intermediate steps while retaining a concise
summary of the outcome. To make this behavior learnable, we develop an
end-to-end reinforcement learning framework FoldGRPO with specific process
rewards to encourage effective task decomposition and context management. On
complex long-horizon tasks (Deep Research and SWE), our folding agent matches
or outperforms the ReAct baselines while using an active context 10$\times$
smaller and significantly outperforms models that rely on summarization-based
context management.

### [11] [Conjecturing: An Overlooked Step in Formal Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11986)
*Jasivan Alex Sivakumar,Philipp Borchert,Ronald Cardenas,Gerasimos Lampouras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出ConjectureBench数据集和评估框架，专门衡量LLMs在数学猜想生成和形式化中的能力，发现当前模型的形式化性能被高估，并提出了Lean-FIRe方法来改进猜想和形式化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动形式化任务忽视了关键的猜想步骤，许多数学问题需要先猜想结论才能形式化。由于LLMs在形式化方面已有困难，且其猜想能力评估有限，需要专门研究这一能力。

Method: 扩充现有数据集创建ConjectureBench，重新设计评估框架和指标，提出推理时方法Lean-FIRe来改进猜想和自动形式化。

Result: 评估显示GPT-4.1和DeepSeek-V3.1的自动形式化性能在考虑猜想后被显著高估。使用Lean-FIRe方法，GPT-4.1成功端到端形式化了13个PutnamBench问题，DeepSeek-V3.1形式化了7个。

Conclusion: LLMs具备生成准确猜想所需的知识，但改进自动形式化需要将猜想视为独立任务，并研究如何正确整合到形式化流程中。

Abstract: Autoformalisation, the task of expressing informal mathematical statements in
formal language, is often viewed as a direct translation process. This,
however, disregards a critical preceding step: conjecturing. Many mathematical
problems cannot be formalised directly without first conjecturing a conclusion
such as an explicit answer, or a specific bound. Since Large Language Models
(LLMs) already struggle with autoformalisation, and the evaluation of their
conjecturing ability is limited and often entangled within autoformalisation or
proof, it is particularly challenging to understand its effect. To address this
gap, we augment existing datasets to create ConjectureBench, and redesign the
evaluation framework and metric specifically to measure the conjecturing
capabilities of LLMs both as a distinct task and within the autoformalisation
pipeline. Our evaluation of foundational models, including GPT-4.1 and
DeepSeek-V3.1, reveals that their autoformalisation performance is
substantially overestimated when the conjecture is accounted for during
evaluation. However, the conjecture should not be assumed to be provided. We
design an inference-time method, Lean-FIRe to improve conjecturing and
autoformalisation, which, to the best of our knowledge, achieves the first
successful end-to-end autoformalisation of 13 PutnamBench problems with GPT-4.1
and 7 with DeepSeek-V3.1. We demonstrate that while LLMs possess the requisite
knowledge to generate accurate conjectures, improving autoformalisation
performance requires treating conjecturing as an independent task, and
investigating further how to correctly integrate it within autoformalisation.
Finally, we provide forward-looking guidance to steer future research toward
improving conjecturing, an overlooked step of formal mathematical reasoning.

### [12] [SAGE: A Top-Down Bottom-Up Knowledge-Grounded User Simulator for Multi-turn AGent Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11997)
*Ryan Shea,Yunan Lu,Liang Qiu,Zhou Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SAGE是一个用于多轮交互式智能体评估的用户模拟框架，通过整合业务上下文知识（包括业务逻辑和基础设施）来生成更真实多样的交互，能比现有方法多发现33%的代理错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模拟用户方法通常建模通用用户，忽视了领域特定原则，无法捕捉真实行为，而人工评估又成本高昂。

Method: SAGE结合自上而下的业务逻辑知识（如理想客户画像）和自下而上的业务基础设施知识（如产品目录、FAQ、知识库），将用户行为锚定在真实客户角色中。

Result: 该方法生成的交互更真实多样，能识别多达33%的代理错误，有效支持错误发现和迭代改进。

Conclusion: SAGE框架通过整合业务知识，显著提升了多轮交互智能体评估的效率和效果，是支持错误发现和迭代改进的有效工具。

Abstract: Evaluating multi-turn interactive agents is challenging due to the need for
human assessment. Evaluation with simulated users has been introduced as an
alternative, however existing approaches typically model generic users and
overlook the domain-specific principles required to capture realistic behavior.
We propose SAGE, a novel user Simulation framework for multi-turn AGent
Evaluation that integrates knowledge from business contexts. SAGE incorporates
top-down knowledge rooted in business logic, such as ideal customer profiles,
grounding user behavior in realistic customer personas. We further integrate
bottom-up knowledge taken from business agent infrastructure (e.g., product
catalogs, FAQs, and knowledge bases), allowing the simulator to generate
interactions that reflect users' information needs and expectations in a
company's target market. Through empirical evaluation, we find that this
approach produces interactions that are more realistic and diverse, while also
identifying up to 33% more agent errors, highlighting its effectiveness as an
evaluation tool to support bug-finding and iterative agent improvement.

### [13] [Generate Logical Equivalence Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12001)
*Xinyu Wang,Haoming Yu,Yicheng Yang,Zhiyuan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种用于离散数学逻辑等价问题的自动问题生成系统，通过形式化语言定义问题，开发线性时间生成算法，旨在防止学术抄袭并提供大量练习题目。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线教学时代抄袭问题日益严重，需要为每个学生生成独特问题来防止抄袭，同时提供大量练习题目。现有方法效率低下且问题难度不一致。

Method: 使用形式化语言定义逻辑等价问题，将其转换为两组生成规则，开发线性时间生成算法。

Result: 学生测试显示生成问题的准确性与教科书问题相当；难度评估表明生成问题与教科书问题难度相似，优于大型语言模型生成的问题。

Conclusion: 提出的自动问题生成系统能有效生成高质量的逻辑等价问题，质量与教科书问题相当，可用于防止抄袭和提供练习。

Abstract: Academic dishonesty is met with zero tolerance in higher education, yet
plagiarism has become increasingly prevalent in the era of online teaching and
learning. Automatic Question Generation (AQG) presents a potential solution to
mitigate copying by creating unique questions for each student. Additionally,
AQG can provide a vast array of practice questions. Our AQG focuses on
generating logical equivalence questions for Discrete Mathematics, a
foundational course for first-year computer science students. A literature
review reveals that existing AQGs for this type of question generate all
propositions that meet user-defined constraints, resulting in inefficiencies
and a lack of uniform question difficulty. To address this, we propose a new
approach that defines logical equivalence questions using a formal language,
translates this language into two sets of generation rules, and develops a
linear-time algorithm for question generation. We evaluated our AQG through two
experiments. The first involved a group of students completing questions
generated by our system. Statistical analysis shows that the accuracy of these
questions is comparable to that of textbook questions. The second experiment
assessed the number of steps required to solve our generated questions,
textbook questions, and those generated by multiple large language models. The
results indicated that the difficulty of our questions was similar to that of
textbook questions, confirming the quality of our AQG.

Motivation: 当前信息抽取领域过度依赖大语言模型，忽视了传统符号或统计系统的经验积累，需要比较不同方法的实际效果和成本。

Method: 在农业领域（猪肉、乳制品、作物）的9个访谈数据上，同时评估神经符号系统和基于LLM的信息抽取系统。

Result: LLM系统在总体F1分数（69.4 vs 52.7）和核心信息F1分数（63.0 vs 47.2）上均优于神经符号系统。

Conclusion: 部署NLP系统存在"隐藏成本"，需要在性能、效率和可控性之间取得平衡，两种方法各有优劣。

Abstract: The current trend in information extraction (IE) is to rely extensively on
large language models, effectively discarding decades of experience in building
symbolic or statistical IE systems. This paper compares a neuro-symbolic (NS)
and an LLM-based IE system in the agricultural domain, evaluating them on nine
interviews across pork, dairy, and crop subdomains. The LLM-based system
outperforms the NS one (F1 total: 69.4 vs. 52.7; core: 63.0 vs. 47.2), where
total includes all extracted information and core focuses on essential details.
However, each system has trade-offs: the NS approach offers faster runtime,
greater control, and high accuracy in context-free tasks but lacks
generalizability, struggles with contextual nuances, and requires significant
resources to develop and maintain. The LLM-based system achieves higher
performance, faster deployment, and easier maintenance but has slower runtime,
limited control, model dependency and hallucination risks. Our findings
highlight the "hidden cost" of deploying NLP systems in real-world
applications, emphasizing the need to balance performance, efficiency, and
control.

TL;DR: 提出了CPR框架，通过优化模糊提示来减少LLM的幻觉生成，提高回答质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决用户使用结构不良或模糊提示导致LLM生成看似合理但错误的事实（幻觉）问题

Method: 使用微调的小型语言模型进行治愈性提示优化，包括清理不良提示和生成额外任务描述

Result: 应用CPR后，提示的生成质量显著提高，幻觉减少，在无外部知识情况下胜率超过90%

Conclusion: CPR框架能有效缓解由不良提示引起的幻觉问题，提升LLM生成质量

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) highlight their fluency
in generating responses to diverse prompts. However, these models sometimes
generate plausible yet incorrect ``hallucinated" facts, undermining trust. A
frequent but often overlooked cause of such errors is the use of poorly
structured or vague prompts by users, leading LLMs to base responses on assumed
rather than actual intentions. To mitigate hallucinations induced by these
ill-formed prompts, we introduce Curative Prompt Refinement (CPR), a
plug-and-play framework for curative prompt refinement that 1) cleans
ill-formed prompts, and 2) generates additional informative task descriptions
to align the intention of the user and the prompt using a fine-tuned small
language model. When applied to language models, we discover that CPR
significantly increases the quality of generation while also mitigating
hallucination. Empirical studies show that prompts with CPR applied achieves
over a 90\% win rate over the original prompts without any external knowledge.

TL;DR: 提出了多阶段提示优化框架MPR，通过迭代修正不良提示中的语法错误、拼写错误和术语误用等问题，显著减少大语言模型的幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在理解和生成任务中表现优异，但存在幻觉问题，其中不良提示（模糊措辞、错误语法、不完整信息）的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: MPR框架采用多阶段方法，使用专门微调的小语言模型逐步修正提示中的标点、拼写和术语错误，通过自反思机制和排序选择最相关输入。

Result: 在幻觉基准测试中，经MPR优化的提示相比原始提示获得了超过85%的胜率，显著减少幻觉并提高输出准确性。

Conclusion: MPR提供了一种轻量级且可适应的解决方案，可与现有后处理幻觉缓解框架结合，提升大语言模型在各领域的可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown strong
performance in natural language understanding and generation tasks. However,
LLMs continue to encounter challenges with hallucinations, where models
generate plausible but incorrect information. While several factors contribute
to hallucinations, the impact of ill-formed prompts, prompts with ambiguous
wording, incorrect grammar, or incomplete information, was relatively under
explored. To address this, we introduce Multi-stage Prompt Refinement (MPR), a
framework designed to systematically improve these ill-formed prompts across
multiple stages. Each stage addresses specific errors such as punctuation,
typographical mistakes, and misuse of key terms, using small language models
(SLMs) fine-tuned for these tasks. MPR iteratively enhances the clarity of
prompts with additional context and employs a self-reflection mechanism with
ranking to prioritize the most relevant input. Experimental results on
hallucination benchmarks show that prompts refined by MPR achieve over an 85~\%
win rate compared to their original forms, demonstrating its effectiveness in
reducing hallucinations and improving LLM output accuracy. Interestingly, we
reveal that MPR can be combined with existing post-hoc hallucination mitigation
frameworks, further enhancing its versatility. MPR provides a lightweight and
adaptable solution for enhancing LLM reliability across various domains.

Conclusion: 论文为LLM不确定性量化在幻觉检测领域的研究现状提供了清晰的图景，指出了当前局限性和未来研究方向。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has transformed the
landscape of natural language processing, enabling breakthroughs across a wide
range of areas including question answering, machine translation, and text
summarization. Yet, their deployment in real-world applications has raised
concerns over reliability and trustworthiness, as LLMs remain prone to
hallucinations that produce plausible but factually incorrect outputs.
Uncertainty quantification (UQ) has emerged as a central research direction to
address this issue, offering principled measures for assessing the
trustworthiness of model generations. We begin by introducing the foundations
of UQ, from its formal definition to the traditional distinction between
epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, and then highlight how these concepts have
been adapted to the context of LLMs. Building on this, we examine the role of
UQ in hallucination detection, where quantifying uncertainty provides a
mechanism for identifying unreliable generations and improving reliability. We
systematically categorize a wide spectrum of existing methods along multiple
dimensions and present empirical results for several representative approaches.
Finally, we discuss current limitations and outline promising future research
directions, providing a clearer picture of the current landscape of LLM UQ for
hallucination detection.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型在处理简单或模糊提示词时表现不佳，导致图像与文本对齐度、美学质量和整体效果不理想

Method: 使用大语言模型构建提示词重写器，设计专门的奖励系统和迭代直接偏好优化训练流程，无需监督数据即可优化用户输入

Result: 在各种T2I模型和基准测试中，提示词重写器能持续提升图像-文本对齐度、视觉质量和美学效果，优于强基线方法，且具有很好的跨模型迁移能力

Conclusion: 提示词重写是一种有效、可扩展且模型无关的策略，能显著改进文本到图像生成系统，训练好的重写器无需重新训练即可在不同T2I骨干模型间通用

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have achieved impressive
results, yet existing models often struggle with simple or underspecified
prompts, leading to suboptimal image-text alignment, aesthetics, and quality.
We propose a prompt rewriting framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) to refine user inputs before feeding them into T2I backbones. Our
approach introduces a carefully designed reward system and an iterative direct
preference optimization (DPO) training pipeline, enabling the rewriter to
enhance prompts without requiring supervised fine-tuning data. We evaluate our
method across diverse T2I models and benchmarks. Results show that our prompt
rewriter consistently improves image-text alignment, visual quality, and
aesthetics, outperforming strong baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong
transferability by showing that a prompt rewriter trained on one T2I backbone
generalizes effectively to others without needing to be retrained. We also
systematically study scalability, evaluating how performance gains scale with
the capacity of the large LLM used as the rewriter. These findings highlight
that prompt rewriting is an effective, scalable, and practical model-agnostic
strategy for improving T2I systems. We plan to release the code and trained
prompt rewriters soon.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出分层对齐方法，针对Transformer模型的不同功能层（局部、中间、全局）进行定向DPO优化，相比传统整体对齐方法能更有效地提升模型性能且避免对齐税。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM对齐技术（如DPO）将模型视为整体进行统一优化，忽视了Transformer架构中不同层的功能专门化（从语法处理到抽象推理），导致优化效果受限。

Method: 引入分层对齐方法，使用LoRA对模型的不同功能块进行外科手术式微调：局部层（语法）、中间层（逻辑）、全局层（事实性）分别应用定向DPO。

Result: 实验表明：局部层对齐提升语法流畅度；全局层对齐不仅改善事实一致性，还是增强逻辑连贯性的最有效策略，且所有分层策略都成功避免了标准DPO中的对齐税问题。

Conclusion: 分层对齐为模型对齐提供了更资源高效、可控和可解释的路径，从整体优化转向结构感知的外科手术式微调具有巨大潜力，可构建更先进可靠的LLM。

Abstract: Existing alignment techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), typically treat the model as a monolithic
entity, applying uniform optimization pressure across all layers. This approach
overlooks the functional specialization within the Transformer architecture,
where different layers are known to handle distinct tasks from syntax to
abstract reasoning. In this paper, we challenge this one-size-fits-all paradigm
by introducing Hierarchical Alignment, a novel method that applies targeted DPO
to distinct functional blocks of a model's layers: local (syntax), intermediate
(logic), and global (factuality). Through a series of controlled experiments on
state-of-the-art models like Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen1.5-7B using LoRA for
surgical fine-tuning, our results, evaluated by a powerful LLM-as-Judge,
demonstrate significant and predictable improvements. Specifically, aligning
the local layers (Local-Align) enhances grammatical fluency. More importantly,
aligning the global layers (Global-Align) not only improves factual consistency
as hypothesized but also proves to be the most effective strategy for enhancing
logical coherence, outperforming all baselines. Critically, all hierarchical
strategies successfully avoid the "alignment tax" observed in standard DPO,
where gains in fluency come at the cost of degraded logical reasoning. These
findings establish a more resource-efficient, controllable, and interpretable
path for model alignment, highlighting the immense potential of shifting from
monolithic optimization to structure-aware surgical fine-tuning to build more
advanced and reliable LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: APCE提出了一种上下文感知的输入块选择方法，通过低维语义相似性匹配来选择最重要的输入块，在长文本摘要任务中仅使用50%-70%的输入序列就能达到或超过全密集基线的性能，同时显著减少KV缓存和自注意力内存开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长上下文Transformer模型的两个关键挑战：(1) 由于二次自注意力和线性KV缓存扩展导致的内存占用增长；(2) ContextRot现象，即模型性能随上下文长度增加而下降。通过选择最重要的输入块来协同减少内存占用并缓解ContextRot效应。

Method: 提出APCE方法，通过低维语义相似性匹配当前查询来选择最重要的输入块。该方法直接在输入上操作，不依赖底层硬件或CUDA环境，具有跨部署系统的兼容性和可扩展性。

Result: 实证评估显示，APCE在长文本摘要任务中仅使用50%-70%的输入序列就能达到或超过全密集基线的性能，同时显著改善了KV缓存和自注意力的内存效率。

Conclusion: APCE为长上下文Transformer模型提供了一种上下文感知的效率解决方案，有望激发针对其他相关长上下文任务的进一步研究。

Abstract: Deploying useful Long-Context Transformer Models (LCTMs) requires addressing
two key challenges: (1) A growing memory footprint due to quadratic
self-attention and linear KV-cache scaling in memory as sequence length
increases; (2) the ContextRot phenomena where empirical evidence suggests that
transformer architecture's performance degrades with increasing context length.
Given the shared dependency on the input, a natural question arises: Can we
surgically select the most important input chunks for processing to
synergistically (a) reduce the memory footprint, and (b) mitigate the
ContextRot effects? In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative
for long-context summarization tasks. We propose APCE as a context-aware
solution to select the most important input chunks through low-dimensional
semantic similarity matching with the current query. By directly operating on
the input, APCE decouples from strict dependency on underlying hardware or CUDA
environments, promising a compatible solution scalable to different deployment
systems. Our empirical evaluations have demonstrated superior or on-par
summarization performance for APCE compared to the full dense baseline using a
fraction (50%-70%) of the input sequence resulting in KV-cache and
self-attention memory efficiency improvements. We hope our findings inspire
further research on context-aware efficiency solutions for LCTMs geared towards
other relevant long-context tasks.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了Verily行为健康安全过滤器(VBHSF)在精神健康危机检测中的表现，与NVIDIA NeMo和OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest进行比较，结果显示VBHSF在敏感性和特异性方面表现优异，特别适合医疗应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理精神健康紧急情况时经常提供有害或不适当的建议，需要开发有效的安全过滤器来防止破坏性行为。

Method: 使用两个数据集进行评估：Verily精神健康危机数据集(1,800条模拟消息)和NVIDIA Aegis AI内容安全数据集子集(794条精神健康相关消息)，并与NVIDIA NeMo和OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest进行比较分析。

Result: VBHSF在Verily数据集上表现出色，敏感性0.990，特异性0.992，F1分数0.939；在NVIDIA数据集上敏感性0.982，准确性0.921。相比其他过滤器，VBHSF在所有情况下都显示出显著更高的敏感性(p < 0.001)。

Conclusion: VBHSF展示了稳健、可泛化的性能，优先考虑敏感性以最小化遗漏危机，这是医疗应用的关键特性。

Abstract: Large language models often mishandle psychiatric emergencies, offering
harmful or inappropriate advice and enabling destructive behaviors. This study
evaluated the Verily behavioral health safety filter (VBHSF) on two datasets:
the Verily Mental Health Crisis Dataset containing 1,800 simulated messages and
the NVIDIA Aegis AI Content Safety Dataset subsetted to 794 mental
health-related messages. The two datasets were clinician-labelled and we
evaluated performance using the clinician labels. Additionally, we carried out
comparative performance analyses against two open source, content moderation
guardrails: OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest and NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails. The VBHSF
demonstrated, well-balanced performance on the Verily Mental Health Crisis
Dataset v1.0, achieving high sensitivity (0.990) and specificity (0.992) in
detecting any mental health crises. It achieved an F1-score of 0.939,
sensitivity ranged from 0.917-0.992, and specificity was >= 0.978 in
identifying specific crisis categories. When evaluated against the NVIDIA Aegis
AI Content Safety Dataset 2.0, VBHSF performance remained highly sensitive
(0.982) and accuracy (0.921) with reduced specificity (0.859). When compared
with the NVIDIA NeMo and OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest guardrails, the VBHSF
demonstrated superior performance metrics across both datasets, achieving
significantly higher sensitivity in all cases (all p < 0.001) and higher
specificity relative to NVIDIA NeMo (p < 0.001), but not to OpenAI Omni
Moderation Latest (p = 0.094). NVIDIA NeMo and OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest
exhibited inconsistent performance across specific crisis types, with
sensitivity for some categories falling below 0.10. Overall, the VBHSF
demonstrated robust, generalizable performance that prioritizes sensitivity to
minimize missed crises, a crucial feature for healthcare applications.

Motivation: LLMs创造力评估面临数据污染和昂贵人工评估的挑战，受人类创造力评估启发，需要开发高效可靠的自动化评估方法。

Method: PACE方法：让LLMs生成平行关联链来评估创造力，通过分析关联链的质量和多样性来衡量模型的创造性表现。

Result: PACE与Chatbot Arena Creative Writing排名高度相关（Spearman's ρ=0.739），高性能LLMs达到普通人水平，但专业人士仍优于LLMs；人类和LLMs都显示关联具体性下降趋势，人类关联模式更多样化。

Conclusion: PACE是评估LLMs创造力的有效方法，虽然高性能LLMs接近普通人创造力水平，但人类在创造性思维上仍保持优势，特别是在关联多样性方面。

Abstract: The evaluation of LLMs' creativity represents a crucial research domain,
though challenges such as data contamination and costly human assessments often
impede progress. Drawing inspiration from human creativity assessment, we
propose PACE, asking LLMs to generate Parallel Association Chains to Evaluate
their creativity. PACE minimizes the risk of data contamination and offers a
straightforward, highly efficient evaluation, as evidenced by its strong
correlation with Chatbot Arena Creative Writing rankings (Spearman's $\rho =
0.739$, $p < 0.001$) across various proprietary and open-source models. A
comparative analysis of associative creativity between LLMs and humans reveals
that while high-performing LLMs achieve scores comparable to average human
performance, professional humans consistently outperform LLMs. Furthermore,
linguistic analysis reveals that both humans and LLMs exhibit a trend of
decreasing concreteness in their associations, and humans demonstrating a
greater diversity of associative patterns.

Result: 实验发现在13B英日双语LLM中，即使使用高质量双语语料，跨语言知识转移仍然具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 多语言领域适应的知识转移机制需要进一步研究，当前方法在跨语言知识获取方面仍存在困难。

Abstract: Multilingual domain adaptation (ML-DA) is widely used to learn new domain
knowledge across languages into large language models (LLMs). Although many
methods have been proposed to improve domain adaptation, the mechanisms of
multilingual knowledge acquisition, how domain knowledge is learned within a
language and transferred across languages, remain underexplored. This gap leads
to suboptimal performance, particularly in low-resource settings. This work
examines the learning dynamics of LLMs during ML-DA. Because prior ML-DA
studies often train and evaluate on datasets with mismatched knowledge
coverage, we propose AdaXEval, an adaptive evaluation method that builds
multiple-choice QA datasets from the same bilingual domain corpus used for
training, thereby directly studying multilingual knowledge acquisition. Through
continual training of LLMs with diverse data recipes, we track how LLMs acquire
domain facts and pinpoint the mechanism behind the transformation process from
domain training data to knowledge. Our experiments on a 13B English-Japanese
bilingual LLM reveal that cross-lingual transfer remains challenging despite a
high-quality bilingual corpus. The code has been released.

Abstract: End-to-end Large Speech Language Models (LSLMs) have demonstrated impressive
conversational generation abilities, yet consistently fall short of traditional
pipeline systems on semantic understanding benchmarks. In this work, we reveal
through systematic experimentation that although LSLMs lose some text input
performance after speech-text alignment training, the performance gap between
speech and text inputs is more pronounced, which we refer to as the modality
gap. To understand this gap, we analyze both coarse- and fine-grained text and
speech representations. At the coarse-grained level, representations of speech
and text in deeper layers are found to be increasingly aligned in direction
(cosine similarity), while concurrently diverging in magnitude (Euclidean
distance). We further find that representation similarity is strongly
correlated with the modality gap. At the fine-grained level, a spontaneous
token-level alignment pattern between text and speech representations is
observed. Based on this, we introduce the Alignment Path Score to quantify
token-level alignment quality, which exhibits stronger correlation with the
modality gap. Building on these insights, we design targeted interventions on
critical tokens through angle projection and length normalization. These
strategies demonstrate the potential to improve correctness for speech inputs.
Our study provides the first systematic empirical analysis of the modality gap
and alignment mechanisms in LSLMs, offering both theoretical and methodological
guidance for future optimization.

Motivation: 随着多模态大语言模型的广泛应用，安全问题日益突出。多轮对话在日常交互中更常见，但比单轮提示风险更大，现有基准未能充分考虑这种情况。

Method: 构建SafeMT基准，包含不同长度的对话，由有害查询和图像生成。提出安全指数(SI)评估对话安全性，并设计对话安全调节器检测对话中的恶意意图，为模型提供相关安全策略。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在多轮对话中的安全机制不足，需要专门的安全措施。提出的对话安全调节器能有效提升模型在多轮对话中的安全性。

Abstract: With the widespread use of multi-modal Large Language models (MLLMs), safety
issues have become a growing concern. Multi-turn dialogues, which are more
common in everyday interactions, pose a greater risk than single prompts;
however, existing benchmarks do not adequately consider this situation. To
encourage the community to focus on the safety issues of these models in
multi-turn dialogues, we introduce SafeMT, a benchmark that features dialogues
of varying lengths generated from harmful queries accompanied by images. This
benchmark consists of 10,000 samples in total, encompassing 17 different
scenarios and four jailbreak methods. Additionally, we propose Safety Index
(SI) to evaluate the general safety of MLLMs during conversations. We assess
the safety of 17 models using this benchmark and discover that the risk of
successful attacks on these models increases as the number of turns in harmful
dialogues rises. This observation indicates that the safety mechanisms of these
models are inadequate for recognizing the hazard in dialogue interactions. We
propose a dialogue safety moderator capable of detecting malicious intent
concealed within conversations and providing MLLMs with relevant safety
policies. Experimental results from several open-source models indicate that
this moderator is more effective in reducing multi-turn ASR compared to existed
guard models.

TL;DR: 提出Credal Transformer，通过基于证据理论的Credal注意力机制替代标准注意力，生成分布集合而非单一分布，直接量化模型不确定性，显著减少幻觉和自信错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的幻觉问题源于Transformer的Softmax函数产生"人工确定性"，将模糊注意力分数压缩为单一概率分布，丢弃了各层的不确定性信息。

Method: 引入Credal Transformer，用基于证据理论的Credal注意力机制替代标准注意力，将注意力分数重新概念化为Dirichlet分布的证据质量，生成"credal set"（分布集合）而非单一注意力向量。

Result: Credal Transformer能够识别分布外输入、量化模糊性，并在不可回答问题上通过弃权显著减少自信错误。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的架构来减轻幻觉，以及将不确定性量化直接集成到模型中的设计范式，为更可靠的AI奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hallucinate, generating factually incorrect yet
confident assertions. We argue this stems from the Transformer's Softmax
function, which creates "Artificial Certainty" by collapsing ambiguous
attention scores into a single probability distribution, discarding uncertainty
information at each layer. To fix this, we introduce the Credal Transformer,
which replaces standard attention with a Credal Attention Mechanism (CAM) based
on evidential theory. CAM produces a "credal set" (a set of distributions)
instead of a single attention vector, with the set's size directly measuring
model uncertainty. We implement this by re-conceptualizing attention scores as
evidence masses for a Dirichlet distribution: sufficient evidence recovers
standard attention, while insufficient evidence yields a diffuse distribution,
representing ambiguity. Empirically, the Credal Transformer identifies
out-of-distribution inputs, quantifies ambiguity, and significantly reduces
confident errors on unanswerable questions by abstaining. Our contribution is a
new architecture to mitigate hallucinations and a design paradigm that
integrates uncertainty quantification directly into the model, providing a

Abstract: With the increasing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), parallel
reasoning has emerged as a new inference paradigm that enhances reasoning
robustness by concurrently exploring multiple lines of thought before
converging on a final answer. It has become a significant trend to explore
parallel reasoning to overcome the fragility of standard sequential methods and
improve practical performance. In this paper, we aim to survey and summarize
the progress and challenges of parallel reasoning. We first present a formal
definition of parallel reasoning and clarify its distinction from related
concepts like Chain-of-Thought. Then, we organize and discuss advanced
techniques based on a novel taxonomy, including non-interactive reasoning,
interactive reasoning, and efficiency-focused decoding strategies.
Additionally, we explore various application scenarios, such as solving complex
problems and enhancing the reliability of LLM outputs.Finally, we highlight the
core challenges of parallel reasoning and suggest potential directions for
future research. We hope that our work can provide a useful roadmap for
beginners and encourage more research on improving parallel reasoning methods.

### [29] [Towards Inference-time Scaling for Continuous Space Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12167)
*Minghan Wang,Thuy-Trang Vu,Ehsan Shareghi,Gholamreza Haffari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究将离散空间推理中的多样本生成和奖励模型重排序技术应用于连续空间推理，发现虽然生成多样性推理路径可行，但离散空间的训练方法在连续空间中效果有限，需要引入新的归纳偏置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索已证明在离散文本推理中有效的推理时扩展技术（多样本生成和奖励模型重排序）是否能够成功适应连续空间的推理任务。

Method: 使用COCONUT连续空间推理LM作为骨干，通过基于dropout的采样生成多样性推理路径，分析Pass@N指标，并探究几何属性和轨迹动态等特征。

Result: 生成多样性推理路径是可行的，Pass@N分析显示存在显著性能提升的潜力，但离散空间的训练方法在连续空间中仅带来边际改进，无法有效区分正确和错误推理。

Conclusion: 连续推理LM的训练框架不仅需要优化准确性，还需要显式地融入可在推理时用于区分正确和错误思维的归纳偏置。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling through multiple sample generation in combination with
Process- or Outcome-Reward Model (PRM or ORM) re-ranking has proven effective
for text-based reasoning in large language models. This paper investigates
whether such established techniques can be successfully adapted to reasoning in
the continuous space, using COCONUT (Hao et al. 2024) continuous space
reasoning LM as the backbone. We demonstrate the feasibility of generating
diverse reasoning paths through dropout-based sampling. Our Pass@N analysis on
the generated samples reveals the potential that could enable a significant
gain in performance akin to observed gain in the discrete space. However, we
highlight unique challenges faced for materializing this gain in the continuous
thought space. In particular, working recipes for data generation and training
PRM and ORM models in the discrete space unlocks only marginal improvements in
the continuous space. Through probing various aspects including geometric
properties and trajectory dynamics we identify the underlying reasons that
prevent effective discrimination between correct and incorrect reasoning
(essential for the functioning of PRM and ORM). Our findings reveal that
current limitations stem from the absence of key inductive biases in continuous
thought representations. We argue that the training frameworks for continuous
reasoning LMs require not only to optimize for accuracy but also to explicitly
incorporate inductive biases that could be utilized during inference-time for
discrimination of correct and incorrect thoughts.\footnote{Our code and data
will be publicly available.}

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLaDR是一个基于大型语言模型的药物重定位框架，通过从LLM中提取生物医学实体的语义丰富文本表示来增强知识图谱嵌入模型，从而改进生物医学概念表示并提升药物重定位性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有药物重定位方法主要依赖生物医学知识图谱，但忽视了现实实验室中的常识性生物医学概念知识，如某些药物与特定治疗根本不相容的机制先验知识。

Method: 从大型语言模型中提取生物医学实体的语义丰富治疗相关文本表示，并用这些表示来微调知识图谱嵌入模型，将治疗相关知识注入KGE中。

Result: 在基准测试中，LLaDR在不同场景下实现了最先进的性能，阿尔茨海默病的案例研究进一步证实了其鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: LLaDR通过注入LLM提取的治疗相关知识，显著改善了生物医学概念表示，增强了对研究不足或复杂适应症的语义理解，为药物重定位提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Drug repurposing plays a critical role in accelerating treatment discovery,
especially for complex and rare diseases. Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs),
which encode rich clinical associations, have been widely adopted to support
this task. However, existing methods largely overlook common-sense biomedical
concept knowledge in real-world labs, such as mechanistic priors indicating
that certain drugs are fundamentally incompatible with specific treatments. To
address this gap, we propose LLaDR, a Large Language Model-assisted framework
for Drug Repurposing, which improves the representation of biomedical concepts
within KGs. Specifically, we extract semantically enriched treatment-related
textual representations of biomedical entities from large language models
(LLMs) and use them to fine-tune knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models. By
injecting treatment-relevant knowledge into KGE, LLaDR largely improves the
representation of biomedical concepts, enhancing semantic understanding of
under-studied or complex indications. Experiments based on benchmarks
demonstrate that LLaDR achieves state-of-the-art performance across different
scenarios, with case studies on Alzheimer's disease further confirming its
robustness and effectiveness. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究大型音频语言模型中的时间偏差问题，发现模型在预测事件时间戳时存在系统性偏差，这种偏差会随着音频长度增加而累积。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型音频语言模型在音频理解和多模态推理中应用日益广泛，但其定位事件发生时间的能力尚未得到充分探索，特别是时间戳预测中的偏差问题。

Method: 通过在带时间戳的数据集上进行受控实验，量化时间偏差现象，并提出时间偏差指数(TBI)来测量预测事件时间中的系统性偏差，同时开发可视化框架。

Result: 研究发现：(i)时间偏差在数据集和模型中普遍存在；(ii)偏差随音频长度增加而累积，在长录音中可达数十秒；(iii)不同事件类型和位置的偏差程度不同。

Conclusion: 当前大型音频语言模型存在基本的时间定位限制，需要开发具有时间鲁棒性的架构来解决这一问题。

Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) are increasingly applied to audio
understanding and multimodal reasoning, yet their ability to locate when events
occur remains underexplored. We present the first systematic study of temporal
bias in LALMs, revealing a key limitation in their timestamp prediction. For
example, when asked "At which second does the lecturer introduce the key
formula?", models often predict timestamps that are consistently earlier or
later than the ground truth. Through controlled experiments on timestamped
datasets, we find that temporal bias (i) is prevalent across datasets and
models, (ii) increases with audio length - even accumulating to tens of seconds
in extended recordings, and (iii) varies across event types and positions. We
quantify this effect with the Temporal Bias Index (TBI), measuring systematic
misalignment in predicted event timings, and complement it with a visualization
framework. Our findings highlight a fundamental limitation in current LALMs and
call for the development of temporally robust architectures.

*Zeyu Yang,Satoshi Nakamura*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于LLM和DPO的语音翻译分割框架，通过偏好对齐提升分割准确性，在翻译质量和延迟方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分割模型虽然比启发式方法更鲁棒，但受限于监督学习目标，缺乏人类偏好对齐，难以满足实时翻译的自然性需求。

Method: 使用基于大语言模型的分割框架，通过直接偏好优化训练，预测更符合人类偏好的自然分割点。

Result: 在ACL 60/60语料库上，DPO调优的LLM在分割准确率上优于SHAS，翻译质量（BLEU、COMET）和延迟（平均滞后）均有提升。

Conclusion: 偏好调优的LLM有潜力超越现有预训练分割模型，推动自适应、人类对齐的同步口译发展。

Abstract: Simultaneous speech translation requires accurate segmentation to balance
translation quality and latency. Recent studies such as SHAS have introduced
pretrained segmentation models, achieving stronger performance than heuristic
rules. However, segmentation models such as SHAS, though pretrained and more
robust than heuristic methods, are still constrained by supervised learning
objectives and do not incorporate human preference alignment, which is crucial
for natural real-time interpretation. In this work, we propose a segmentation
framework based on large language models (LLMs) trained with Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO). By leveraging preference alignment, our method enables LLMs
to predict natural segmentation points that better meet the demands of
real-time translation. We evaluate the system on the ACL 60/60 corpus across
three language pairs (English-Japanese, Chinese, German), using SeamlessM4T v2
as the translation backbone. Experimental results show that our DPO-tuned LLM
achieves higher segmentation accuracy than SHAS and yields consistent
improvements in translation quality (BLEU, COMET) as well as latency (Average
Lagging). Furthermore, our system benefits from IWSLT baselines for direct
comparison. These findings highlight the potential of preference-tuned LLMs to
surpass existing pretrained segmentation models and advance adaptive,
human-aligned simultaneous interpretation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HALF框架通过将九个应用领域分为三个危害等级，在真实场景中评估LLM偏见并考虑危害严重性，发现LLM在不同领域公平性不一致，模型大小或性能不能保证公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估缺乏真实场景基础且未考虑危害严重性差异，如手术决策偏见与文本摘要风格偏见不应同等对待。

Method: HALF框架使用五阶段流程，将九个应用领域组织为严重、中等、轻微三个等级，在真实应用场景中评估模型偏见并按危害严重性加权结果。

Result: 评估八个LLM显示：(1)LLM在不同领域公平性不一致；(2)模型大小或性能不能保证公平性；(3)推理模型在医疗决策支持中表现更好但在教育中更差。

Conclusion: HALF揭示了先前基准测试成功与部署准备度之间存在明显差距。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across high-impact
domains, from clinical decision support and legal analysis to hiring and
education, making fairness and bias evaluation before deployment critical.
However, existing evaluations lack grounding in real-world scenarios and do not
account for differences in harm severity, e.g., a biased decision in surgery
should not be weighed the same as a stylistic bias in text summarization. To
address this gap, we introduce HALF (Harm-Aware LLM Fairness), a
deployment-aligned framework that assesses model bias in realistic applications
and weighs the outcomes by harm severity. HALF organizes nine application
domains into three tiers (Severe, Moderate, Mild) using a five-stage pipeline.
Our evaluation results across eight LLMs show that (1) LLMs are not
consistently fair across domains, (2) model size or performance do not
guarantee fairness, and (3) reasoning models perform better in medical decision
support but worse in education. We conclude that HALF exposes a clear gap
between previous benchmarking success and deployment readiness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现微调后的大语言模型会学习到Knobe效应这种道德偏见，通过层修补分析发现偏见集中在特定层，将预训练模型的激活值修补到关键层即可消除偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大语言模型在微调过程中如何内化人类偏见，特别是Knobe效应这种道德判断偏见，并理解其具体机制。

Method: 对3个开源权重的大语言模型进行层修补分析，识别偏见所在的具体层，并尝试用预训练模型的激活值修补关键层。

Result: 发现Knobe效应偏见确实在微调过程中被学习，且集中在特定层；仅需将预训练模型激活值修补到少数关键层即可消除偏见。

Conclusion: 大语言模型中的社会偏见可以被解释、定位并通过针对性干预来缓解，无需重新训练模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to internalize human-like biases
during finetuning, yet the mechanisms by which these biases manifest remain
unclear. In this work, we investigated whether the well-known Knobe effect, a
moral bias in intentionality judgements, emerges in finetuned LLMs and whether
it can be traced back to specific components of the model. We conducted a
Layer-Patching analysis across 3 open-weights LLMs and demonstrated that the
bias is not only learned during finetuning but also localized in a specific set
of layers. Surprisingly, we found that patching activations from the
corresponding pretrained model into just a few critical layers is sufficient to
eliminate the effect. Our findings offer new evidence that social biases in
LLMs can be interpreted, localized, and mitigated through targeted
interventions, without the need for model retraining.

*Jiakai Li,Rongzheng Wang,Yizhuo Ma,Shuang Liang,Guangchun Luo,Ke Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出DSAS方法解决LLMs在多文档问答中的长距离依赖建模和"中间信息丢失"问题，通过两个模块实现：CGW模块评估段落相关性，RAS模块抑制关键与无关文本间的信息交换，无需架构修改或额外训练参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在多文档问答任务中存在两个主要限制：长距离依赖建模困难，无法聚焦长文本中的关键信息；以及"中间信息丢失"问题，难以处理长输入中间部分的信息。现有解决方案要么截断全局依赖，要么需要昂贵的微调，缺乏通用简单方案。

Method: 提出双阶段自适应锐化(DSAS)方法，包含两个模块：上下文门控加权(CGW)模块通过分层注意力跟踪和位置感知加权评估段落相关性；互斥注意力抑制(RAS)模块通过抑制关键段落与无关文本间的信息交换来增强对关键段落的关注。

Result: 在四个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，DSAS在主流LLMs（Llama、Qwen、Mistral和Deepseek）上均有效，在Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct和Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct上多文档问答任务的F1分数平均提升4.2%。消融研究证实了CGW和RAS模块的贡献。

Conclusion: DSAS作为一种即插即用解决方案，无需架构修改或额外训练参数，有效解决了LLMs在多文档问答中的长距离依赖建模和中间信息丢失问题，具有鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) show considerable promise across various
fields, they have notable limitations in handling multi-document question
answering (Multi-doc QA) tasks. The first challenge is long-range dependency
modeling, where LLMs struggle to focus on key information in long texts, which
weakens important semantic connections. Second, most LLMs suffer from the
''lost-in-the-middle'' issue, where they have difficulty processing information
in the middle of long inputs. Current solutions either truncate global
dependencies or demand costly finetuning, ultimately lacking a universal and
simple solution for these challenges. To resolve these limitations, we propose
Dual-Stage Adaptive Sharpening (DSAS) containing two modules. (i) The
Contextual Gate Weighting (CGW) module alleviates ''lost-in-the-middle'' by
assessing paragraph relevance through layer-wise attention tracking and
position-aware weighting. (ii) The Reciprocal Attention Suppression (RAS)
module enhances focus on critical paragraphs by suppressing information
exchange between key and irrelevant texts, thus mitigating the limitations in
long-range dependency modeling. Notably, DSAS functions as a plug-and-play
solution requiring no architectural modifications or extra training parameters.
Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate DSAS's efficacy across
mainstream LLMs (Llama, Qwen, Mistral, and Deepseek), with an average F1-score
improvement of 4.2% in Multi-doc QA tasks on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and
Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct. Ablation studies confirm the essential contributions of
both the CGW and RAS modules. In addition, detailed discussions in the Appendix
further validate the robustness and scalability of DSAS.

*Blazej Manczak,Eric Lin,Francisco Eiras,James O' Neill,Vaikkunth Mugunthan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了MedQA-Followup框架，用于评估医疗问答中多轮对话的鲁棒性，发现LLMs在受到挑战时准确性显著下降，间接干预比直接建议更具破坏性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估框架主要关注单轮问答的理想化条件，忽略了医疗咨询中常见的冲突输入、误导性上下文和权威影响等复杂情况，需要系统评估多轮对话的鲁棒性。

Method: 引入MedQA-Followup框架，区分浅层鲁棒性（抵抗误导性初始上下文）和深层鲁棒性（在答案被挑战时保持准确性），并采用间接-直接轴分离上下文框架和明确建议。在MedQA数据集上进行受控干预，评估五个最先进的LLM。

Result: 模型在浅层扰动下表现良好，但在多轮设置中表现出严重脆弱性，Claude Sonnet 4的准确率从91.2%降至13.5%。反直觉的是，基于上下文的间接干预通常比直接建议更具破坏性。

Conclusion: 多轮鲁棒性是医疗LLM安全可靠部署的关键但未充分探索的维度，需要进一步研究以提高模型在复杂医疗环境中的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transitioning into medical clinical
use, yet their reliability under realistic, multi-turn interactions remains
poorly understood. Existing evaluation frameworks typically assess single-turn
question answering under idealized conditions, overlooking the complexities of
medical consultations where conflicting input, misleading context, and
authority influence are common. We introduce MedQA-Followup, a framework for
systematically evaluating multi-turn robustness in medical question answering.
Our approach distinguishes between shallow robustness (resisting misleading
initial context) and deep robustness (maintaining accuracy when answers are
challenged across turns), while also introducing an indirect-direct axis that
separates contextual framing (indirect) from explicit suggestion (direct).
Using controlled interventions on the MedQA dataset, we evaluate five
state-of-the-art LLMs and find that while models perform reasonably well under
shallow perturbations, they exhibit severe vulnerabilities in multi-turn
settings, with accuracy dropping from 91.2% to as low as 13.5% for Claude
Sonnet 4. Counterintuitively, indirect, context-based interventions are often
more harmful than direct suggestions, yielding larger accuracy drops across
models and exposing a significant vulnerability for clinical deployment.
Further compounding analyses reveal model differences, with some showing
additional performance drops under repeated interventions while others
partially recovering or even improving. These findings highlight multi-turn
robustness as a critical but underexplored dimension for safe and reliable
deployment of medical LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chinese ModernBERT是一个从头开始训练的中文编码器，通过定制化的32k BPE词汇表、动态掩码训练、两阶段预训练和优化的学习率调度，在中文NLP任务上实现了竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Transformer改进在英语上取得了显著进展，但这些改进未能完全迁移到中文，因为中文在分词和形态学上与英语存在显著差异。

Method: 使用硬件感知的32k BPE词汇表、动态掩码训练（30%到15%）、两阶段预训练（从1024扩展到8192上下文长度）、阻尼余弦学习率调度，并在1.2T中文token上进行预训练。

Result: 在CLUE基准测试中与强大的中文编码器竞争，在SimCLUE上达到0.505（Pearson）/0.537（Spearman）的相关性分数，超越了Qwen-0.6B-embedding。

Conclusion: Chinese ModernBERT展示了在中文NLP任务上的有效性，特别是在检索导向任务上，通过添加对比数据可以进一步提升性能，为中文语言模型提供了可扩展的发展路径。

Abstract: Encoder-only Transformers have advanced along three axes -- architecture,
data, and systems -- yielding Pareto gains in accuracy, speed, and memory
efficiency. Yet these improvements have not fully transferred to Chinese, where
tokenization and morphology differ markedly from English. We introduce Chinese
ModernBERT, a from-scratch Chinese encoder that couples: (i) a hardware-aware
32k BPE vocabulary tailored to frequent Chinese affixes/compounds, lowering the
embedding budget; (ii) whole-word masking (WWM) with a dynamic masking
curriculum (30% -> 15%) to align task difficulty with training progress; (iii)
a two-stage pre-training pipeline that extends the native context from 1,024 to
8,192 tokens using RoPE and alternating local/global attention; and (iv) a
damped-cosine learning-rate schedule for stable long-horizon optimization. We
pre-train on ~1.2T Chinese tokens from CCI3-HQ, CCI4 (Chinese), and
Cosmopedia-Chinese. On CLUE, Chinese ModernBERT is competitive with strong
Chinese encoders under a unified fine-tuning protocol. Under bf16 it achieves
high long-sequence throughput while maintaining strong short-sequence speed,
reflecting benefits from budget allocation and attention design. To probe
retrieval-oriented quality, we add a small amount of open contrastive data:
fine-tuning on SimCLUE (~3M pairs) improves further when adding T2Ranking
(~2M), reaching 0.505 (Pearson) / 0.537 (Spearman) on the SimCLUE test set.
Under this open-data setting, Chinese ModernBERT surpasses Qwen-0.6B-embedding
on SimCLUE, suggesting a clear scaling path for STS with additional curated
pairs. We will release tokenizer and weights to facilitate reproducible
research.

Motivation: 解决语料库快速扩张时人工标注成为方法瓶颈的问题，探索利用LLMs实现大规模自动化语法标注的可能性。

Method: 四阶段工作流：提示工程、事前评估、自动批量处理、事后验证，使用GPT-5通过OpenAI API进行标注。

Result: 在60小时内完成了COHA语料库143,933个句子的标注，在两个复杂标注任务中达到98%+的准确率。

Conclusion: LLMs能够以最小人工干预大规模执行数据准备任务，为基于语料库的研究开辟新可能，但需关注成本、许可和伦理问题。

Abstract: As natural language corpora expand at an unprecedented rate, manual
annotation remains a significant methodological bottleneck in corpus linguistic
work. We address this challenge by presenting a scalable, unsupervised pipeline
for automating grammatical annotation in voluminous corpora using large
language models (LLMs). Unlike previous supervised and iterative approaches,
our method employs a four-phase workflow: prompt engineering, pre-hoc
evaluation, automated batch processing, and post-hoc validation. We demonstrate
the pipeline's accessibility and effectiveness through a diachronic case study
of variation in the English consider construction. Using GPT-5 through the
OpenAI API, we annotate 143,933 sentences from the Corpus of Historical
American English (COHA) in under 60 hours, achieving 98%+ accuracy on two
sophisticated annotation procedures. Our results suggest that LLMs can perform
a range of data preparation tasks at scale with minimal human intervention,
opening new possibilities for corpus-based research, though implementation
requires attention to costs, licensing, and other ethical considerations.

Motivation: 现有反言论生成方法存在可靠性不足和可扩展性差的问题，需要开发更可信和连贯的反言论生成系统。

Method: 构建包含32,792个文本的知识库，集成RAG管道，将反言论生成建模为基于知识的文本生成过程。

Result: 在MultiTarget-CONAN数据集上的评估显示，该框架在标准指标和人工评估中均优于标准LLM基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架和知识库为研究可信和合理的反言论生成铺平了道路，适用于仇恨言论及其他领域。

Abstract: Counter-speech generation is at the core of many expert activities, such as
fact-checking and hate speech, to counter harmful content. Yet, existing work
treats counter-speech generation as pure text generation task, mainly based on
Large Language Models or NGO experts. These approaches show severe drawbacks
due to the limited reliability and coherence in the generated countering text,
and in scalability, respectively. To close this gap, we introduce a novel
framework to model counter-speech generation as knowledge-wise text generation
process. Our framework integrates advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines to ensure the generation of trustworthy counter-speech for 8 main
target groups identified in the hate speech literature, including women, people
of colour, persons with disabilities, migrants, Muslims, Jews, LGBT persons,
and other. We built a knowledge base over the United Nations Digital Library,
EUR-Lex and the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights, comprising a total of 32,792
texts. We use the MultiTarget-CONAN dataset to empirically assess the quality
of the generated counter-speech, both through standard metrics (i.e., JudgeLM)
and a human evaluation. Results show that our framework outperforms standard
LLM baselines and competitive approach, on both assessments. The resulting
framework and the knowledge base pave the way for studying trustworthy and
sound counter-speech generation, in hate speech and beyond.

Motivation: 理解大型语言模型(LLMs)与人类大脑活动之间的对齐可以揭示语言处理的计算原理，特别是解决关于大脑对齐与下一词预测关系的争议性研究问题。

Method: 引入细粒度输入归因方法，识别对大脑-LLM对齐最重要的具体词语，并分析BA和NWP所依赖的词语子集。

Result: 发现BA和NWP依赖的词语子集存在显著差异：NWP表现出近因和首因偏差，关注语法信息；而BA优先考虑语义和语篇层面信息，具有更有针对性的近因效应。

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了对LLMs与人类语言处理关系的理解，突出了BA和NWP在特征依赖上的差异，所提出的归因方法可广泛应用于探索模型预测在各种语言处理任务中的认知相关性。

Abstract: Understanding the alignment between large language models (LLMs) and human
brain activity can reveal computational principles underlying language
processing. We introduce a fine-grained input attribution method to identify
the specific words most important for brain-LLM alignment, and leverage it to
study a contentious research question about brain-LLM alignment: the
relationship between brain alignment (BA) and next-word prediction (NWP). Our
findings reveal that BA and NWP rely on largely distinct word subsets: NWP
exhibits recency and primacy biases with a focus on syntax, while BA
prioritizes semantic and discourse-level information with a more targeted
recency effect. This work advances our understanding of how LLMs relate to
human language processing and highlights differences in feature reliance
between BA and NWP. Beyond this study, our attribution method can be broadly
applied to explore the cognitive relevance of model predictions in diverse
language processing tasks.

Motivation: 现有MoE模型的稀疏激活机制支持专家卸载策略，但受限于CPU-GPU互联带宽。现有预取方法训练开销大且在细粒度专家分割的现代MoE模型中效果不佳。

Method: 提出MoBiLE框架，采用混合大小专家机制：不重要token使用半数量专家加速，重要token使用完整专家保证质量；设计了专门的回退和预取机制来切换大小专家以提高内存效率。

Result: 在四种典型现代MoE架构和挑战性生成任务上评估，MoBiLE在消费级GPU系统上相比基线实现了1.60-1.72倍加速，精度损失可忽略。

Conclusion: MoBiLE是一个即插即用的MoE推理框架，通过混合大小专家机制有效解决了专家卸载中的带宽瓶颈问题，在保持模型质量的同时显著提升了推理速度。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have recently demonstrated exceptional
performance across a diverse range of applications. The principle of sparse
activation in MoE models facilitates an offloading strategy, wherein active
experts are maintained in GPU HBM, while inactive experts are stored in CPU
DRAM. The efficacy of this approach, however, is fundamentally constrained by
the limited bandwidth of the CPU-GPU interconnect. To mitigate this bottleneck,
existing approaches have employed prefetching to accelerate MoE inference.
These methods attempt to predict and prefetch the required experts using
specially trained modules. Nevertheless, such techniques are often encumbered
by significant training overhead and have shown diminished effectiveness on
recent MoE models with fine-grained expert segmentation.
  In this paper, we propose MoBiLE, a plug-and-play offloading-based MoE
inference framework with \textit{mixture of big-little experts}. It reduces the
number of experts for unimportant tokens to half for acceleration while
maintaining full experts for important tokens to guarantee model quality.
Further, a dedicated fallback and prefetching mechanism is designed for
switching between little and big experts to improve memory efficiency. We
evaluate MoBiLE on four typical modern MoE architectures and challenging
generative tasks. Our results show that MoBiLE achieves a speedup of 1.60x to
1.72x compared to the baseline on a consumer GPU system, with negligible
degradation in accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM在学术评审中存在偏见：系统性地给LLM生成的论文打高分，而对包含批判性陈述的人类论文评分偏低，这源于LLM对特定语言风格的偏好和对批判性陈述的厌恶。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在学术工作流程中的深度整合，需要探究其在研究和评审双重角色中可能带来的风险，特别是对学术公平性的影响。

Method: 通过模拟实验，构建研究代理生成和修订论文，评审代理评估提交的论文，并进行人工标注来对比LLM评审与人类判断的差异。

Result: 发现LLM评审存在系统性偏见：对LLM生成论文评分虚高，对包含批判性陈述的人类论文持续低估；这些偏见源于语言特征偏好和对批判性陈述的厌恶。

Conclusion: 在同行评审中部署LLM需谨慎，因其存在公平性风险；但LLM指导的修订能提升论文质量，对早期研究者和低质量论文有潜在价值。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has inspired
researchers to integrate them extensively into the academic workflow,
potentially reshaping how research is practiced and reviewed. While previous
studies highlight the potential of LLMs in supporting research and peer review,
their dual roles in the academic workflow and the complex interplay between
research and review bring new risks that remain largely underexplored. In this
study, we focus on how the deep integration of LLMs into both peer-review and
research processes may influence scholarly fairness, examining the potential
risks of using LLMs as reviewers by simulation. This simulation incorporates a
research agent, which generates papers and revises, alongside a review agent,
which assesses the submissions. Based on the simulation results, we conduct
human annotations and identify pronounced misalignment between LLM-based
reviews and human judgments: (1) LLM reviewers systematically inflate scores
for LLM-authored papers, assigning them markedly higher scores than
human-authored ones; (2) LLM reviewers persistently underrate human-authored
papers with critical statements (e.g., risk, fairness), even after multiple
revisions. Our analysis reveals that these stem from two primary biases in LLM
reviewers: a linguistic feature bias favoring LLM-generated writing styles, and
an aversion toward critical statements. These results highlight the risks and
equity concerns posed to human authors and academic research if LLMs are
deployed in the peer review cycle without adequate caution. On the other hand,
revisions guided by LLM reviews yield quality gains in both LLM-based and human
evaluations, illustrating the potential of the LLMs-as-reviewers for
early-stage researchers and enhancing low-quality papers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标记化差异阻碍了不同语言群体公平获取人工智能服务，需要系统量化大型语言模型中的计算不平等问题。

Method: 使用标准化实验框架，通过tiktoken库对200多种语言样本进行统一标记化，收集标记化统计数据，使用TPS和RTC等评估指标与英语基准进行比较。

Result: 发现系统性标记化差异：拉丁文字语言标记化效率高，非拉丁和形态复杂语言标记化膨胀显著，RTC比率通常高出3-5倍，导致计算成本增加和有效上下文利用减少。

Conclusion: 当前AI系统存在结构性不平等，低资源和非拉丁语言使用者面临不成比例的计算劣势，未来应开发考虑语言类型多样性的标记化策略和自适应词汇构建方法。

Abstract: Tokenization disparities pose a significant barrier to achieving equitable
access to artificial intelligence across linguistically diverse populations.
This study conducts a large-scale cross-linguistic evaluation of tokenization
efficiency in over 200 languages to systematically quantify computational
inequities in large language models (LLMs). Using a standardized experimental
framework, we applied consistent preprocessing and normalization protocols,
followed by uniform tokenization through the tiktoken library across all
language samples. Comprehensive tokenization statistics were collected using
established evaluation metrics, including Tokens Per Sentence (TPS) and
Relative Tokenization Cost (RTC), benchmarked against English baselines. Our
cross-linguistic analysis reveals substantial and systematic disparities:
Latin-script languages consistently exhibit higher tokenization efficiency,
while non-Latin and morphologically complex languages incur significantly
greater token inflation, often 3-5 times higher RTC ratios. These
inefficiencies translate into increased computational costs and reduced
effective context utilization for underrepresented languages. Overall, the
findings highlight structural inequities in current AI systems, where speakers
of low-resource and non-Latin languages face disproportionate computational
disadvantages. Future research should prioritize the development of
linguistically informed tokenization strategies and adaptive vocabulary
construction methods that incorporate typological diversity, ensuring more
inclusive and computationally equitable multilingual AI systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PRoH是一个动态规划和推理框架，通过上下文感知规划、结构化问题分解和实体权重重叠引导的推理路径检索，解决了现有知识超图检索方法的局限性，在多跳问答任务中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于知识超图的检索增强生成方法存在三个主要限制：静态检索规划、非自适应检索执行以及对知识超图结构和语义的浅层使用，这些限制了它们执行有效多跳问答的能力。

Method: PRoH包含三个核心创新：(1)上下文感知规划模块，通过描绘局部知识超图邻域来指导结构化的推理计划生成；(2)结构化问题分解过程，将子问题组织为动态演化的有向无环图，实现自适应多轨迹探索；(3)实体权重重叠引导的推理路径检索算法，优先考虑语义连贯的超边遍历。

Result: 在多个领域的实验中，PRoH实现了最先进的性能，平均F1分数比之前的SOTA模型HyperGraphRAG提高了19.73%，生成评估分数提高了8.41%，同时在长距离多跳推理任务中保持了强大的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PRoH框架通过动态规划和结构化推理，有效克服了现有知识超图检索方法的局限性，在多跳问答任务中展现了卓越的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Knowledge Hypergraphs (KHs) have recently emerged as a knowledge
representation for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), offering a paradigm to
model multi-entity relations into a structured form. However, existing KH-based
RAG methods suffer from three major limitations: static retrieval planning,
non-adaptive retrieval execution, and superficial use of KH structure and
semantics, which constrain their ability to perform effective multi-hop
question answering. To overcome these limitations, we propose PRoH, a dynamic
Planning and Reasoning over Knowledge Hypergraphs framework. PRoH incorporates
three core innovations: (i) a context-aware planning module that sketches the
local KH neighborhood to guide structurally grounded reasoning plan generation;
(ii) a structured question decomposition process that organizes subquestions as
a dynamically evolving Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to enable adaptive,
multi-trajectory exploration; and (iii) an Entity-Weighted Overlap (EWO)-guided
reasoning path retrieval algorithm that prioritizes semantically coherent
hyperedge traversals. Experiments across multiple domains demonstrate that PRoH
achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the prior SOTA model
HyperGraphRAG by an average of 19.73% in F1 and 8.41% in Generation Evaluation
(G-E) score, while maintaining strong robustness in long-range multi-hop
reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了CLEAR框架，通过隐藏状态探测定位知识冲突，并进行冲突感知微调，显著提升RAG系统的准确性和上下文忠实度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统存在不忠实问题，模型响应与检索证据相矛盾。现有方法将LLM视为黑盒，忽视了LLM内部如何整合检索证据与参数记忆，特别是在知识冲突时的机制。

Method: CLEAR框架：(1) 将上下文分解为细粒度句子级知识；(2) 使用隐藏状态探测定位冲突知识；(3) 引入冲突感知微调指导模型准确整合检索证据。

Result: 在三个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，CLEAR显著提高了准确性和上下文忠实度，在不同冲突条件下始终优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: CLEAR通过分析LLM内部表示和冲突定位，有效解决了RAG系统的忠实性问题，为理解LLM如何整合外部知识提供了新视角。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm to
enhance the factuality of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing RAG
systems often suffer from an unfaithfulness issue, where the model's response
contradicts evidence from the retrieved context. Existing approaches to
improving contextual faithfulness largely rely on external interventions, such
as prompt engineering, decoding constraints, or reward-based fine-tuning. These
works treat the LLM as a black box and overlook a crucial question: how does
the LLM internally integrate retrieved evidence with its parametric memory,
particularly under knowledge conflicts? To address this gap, we conduct a
probing-based analysis of hidden-state representations in LLMs and observe
three findings: knowledge integration occurs hierarchically, conflicts manifest
as latent signals at the sentence level, and irrelevant context is often
amplified when aligned with parametric knowledge. Building on these findings,
we propose CLEAR (Conflict-Localized and Enhanced Attention for RAG), a
framework that (i) decomposes context into fine-grained sentence-level
knowledge, (ii) employs hidden-state probing to localize conflicting knowledge,
and (iii) introduces conflict-aware fine-tuning to guide the model to
accurately integrate retrieved evidence. Extensive experiments across three
benchmarks demonstrate that CLEAR substantially improves both accuracy and
contextual faithfulness, consistently outperforming strong baselines under
diverse conflict conditions. The related resources are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过多语言Wug测试评估LLM在形态学泛化任务中的表现，发现模型能够以类似人类的准确率处理新词，但准确率模式更多受训练数据量而非语言结构复杂度影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM的语言能力是否接近人类水平，以及模型表现主要受语言复杂度还是训练数据量的影响。

Method: 使用多语言Wug测试，在四种语言（加泰罗尼亚语、英语、希腊语、西班牙语）上测试六个模型，并与人类表现对比。

Result: 模型能够以人类水平的准确率对新词进行形态学泛化，但准确率与语言社区规模和数字资源可用性更相关，而非结构复杂度。

Conclusion: 模型行为主要受语言资源丰富度驱动，而非对语法复杂度的敏感性，仅表面类似人类语言能力。

Abstract: The linguistic abilities of Large Language Models are a matter of ongoing
debate. This study contributes to this discussion by investigating model
performance in a morphological generalization task that involves novel words.
Using a multilingual adaptation of the Wug Test, six models were tested across
four partially unrelated languages (Catalan, English, Greek, and Spanish) and
compared with human speakers. The aim is to determine whether model accuracy
approximates human competence and whether it is shaped primarily by linguistic
complexity or by the quantity of available training data. Consistent with
previous research, the results show that the models are able to generalize
morphological processes to unseen words with human-like accuracy. However,
accuracy patterns align more closely with community size and data availability
than with structural complexity, refining earlier claims in the literature. In
particular, languages with larger speaker communities and stronger digital
representation, such as Spanish and English, revealed higher accuracy than
less-resourced ones like Catalan and Greek. Overall, our findings suggest that
model behavior is mainly driven by the richness of linguistic resources rather
than by sensitivity to grammatical complexity, reflecting a form of performance
that resembles human linguistic competence only superficially.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SMEC是一个新颖的训练框架，通过序列嵌套表示学习、自适应维度选择和可选择的跨批次记忆模块，有效压缩LLM嵌入维度，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算和存储需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型生成的高维嵌入虽然包含丰富的语义和句法信息，但加剧了计算复杂度和存储需求，阻碍了实际部署。

Method: 提出SMEC框架，包含：1）SMRL方法减少训练中的梯度方差；2）ADS模块降低维度剪枝时的信息退化；3）S-XBM模块增强高低维嵌入间的无监督学习。

Result: 在图像、文本和多模态数据集上的实验表明，SMEC实现了显著的维度压缩同时保持性能。在BEIR数据集上，压缩后的256维LLM2Vec嵌入性能比Matryoshka-Adaptor和Search-Adaptor分别提升1.1和2.7个点。

Conclusion: SMEC框架能够有效解决高维嵌入带来的计算和存储问题，为LLM的实际部署提供了可行的压缩方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate high-dimensional embeddings that
capture rich semantic and syntactic information. However, high-dimensional
embeddings exacerbate computational complexity and storage requirements,
thereby hindering practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel training framework named Sequential Matryoshka Embedding Compression
(SMEC). This framework introduces the Sequential Matryoshka Representation
Learning(SMRL) method to mitigate gradient variance during training, the
Adaptive Dimension Selection (ADS) module to reduce information degradation
during dimension pruning, and the Selectable Cross-batch Memory (S-XBM) module
to enhance unsupervised learning between high- and low-dimensional embeddings.
Experiments on image, text, and multimodal datasets demonstrate that SMEC
achieves significant dimensionality reduction while maintaining performance.
For instance, on the BEIR dataset, our approach improves the performance of
compressed LLM2Vec embeddings (256 dimensions) by 1.1 points and 2.7 points
compared to the Matryoshka-Adaptor and Search-Adaptor models, respectively.

Method: 构建个性化检测基准数据集，提出基于特征反转陷阱的检测器性能预测方法，通过识别潜在特征方向构建探针数据集来评估检测器依赖性。

Result: 实验显示个性化设置下检测器性能存在显著差距，某些先进模型性能大幅下降，提出的预测方法与实际性能差距相关性达85%。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了个性化文本检测的挑战，提出的方法能准确预测检测器性能变化，鼓励进一步研究个性化文本检测。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have grown more powerful in language generation,
producing fluent text and even imitating personal style. Yet, this ability also
heightens the risk of identity impersonation. To the best of our knowledge, no
prior work has examined personalized machine-generated text (MGT) detection. In
this paper, we introduce \dataset, the first benchmark for evaluating detector
robustness in personalized settings, built from literary and blog texts paired
with their LLM-generated imitations. Our experimental results demonstrate large
performance gaps across detectors in personalized settings: some
state-of-the-art models suffer significant drops. We attribute this limitation
to the \textit{feature-inversion trap}, where features that are discriminative
in general domains become inverted and misleading when applied to personalized
text. Based on this finding, we propose \method, a simple and reliable way to
predict detector performance changes in personalized settings. \method
identifies latent directions corresponding to inverted features and constructs
probe datasets that differ primarily along these features to evaluate detector
dependence. Our experiments show that \method can accurately predict both the
direction and the magnitude of post-transfer changes, showing 85\% correlation
with the actual performance gaps. We hope that this work will encourage further
research on personalized text detection.

Motivation: 测试时缩放技术此前仅限于有明确正确答案的领域（如数学和编程），本研究旨在探索其在LeWiDi标注分歧任务上的适用性。

Method: 使用三种测试时缩放方法：模型平均、多数投票和Best-of-N采样，在LeWiDi-2025任务上进行实验。

Result: 模型平均和多数投票方法在LeWiDi任务上能持续提升LLM性能，但Best-of-N方法未能有效转移。

Conclusion: Best-of-N方法目前无法从数学领域成功转移到LeWiDi任务，需要进一步分析这种差距的原因。

Abstract: Test-time scaling is a family of techniques to improve LLM outputs at
inference time by performing extra computation. To the best of our knowledge,
test-time scaling has been limited to domains with verifiably correct answers,
like mathematics and coding. We transfer test-time scaling to the LeWiDi-2025
tasks to evaluate annotation disagreements. We experiment with three test-time
scaling methods: two benchmark algorithms (Model Averaging and Majority
Voting), and a Best-of-N sampling method. The two benchmark methods improve LLM
performance consistently on the LeWiDi tasks, but the Best-of-N method does
not. Our experiments suggest that the Best-of-N method does not currently
transfer from mathematics to LeWiDi tasks, and we analyze potential reasons for
this gap.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究VLMs在处理典型和异常实例时如何在语用先验（输入相关）和语义先验（概念一般性）之间进行权衡。

Method: 引入VISaGE评估数据集，包含典型和异常图像，通过精心平衡的实验设计分析VLMs的权衡机制。

Result: 当图像与文本不一致时，概念理解能力下降；语用先验的影响比语义先验更强。

Conclusion: VLMs在处理个体实例时更依赖语用先验，当输入不一致时概念理解会受损。

Abstract: While Vision Language Models (VLMs) learn conceptual representations, in the
form of generalized knowledge, during training, they are typically used to
analyze individual instances. When evaluation instances are atypical, this
paradigm results in tension between two priors in the model. The first is a
pragmatic prior that the textual and visual input are both relevant, arising
from VLM finetuning on congruent inputs; the second is a semantic prior that
the conceptual representation is generally true for instances of the category.
In order to understand how VLMs trade off these priors, we introduce a new
evaluation dataset, VISaGE, consisting of both typical and exceptional images.
In carefully balanced experiments, we show that conceptual understanding
degrades when the assumption of congruency underlying the pragmatic prior is
violated with incongruent images. This effect is stronger than the effect of
the semantic prior when querying about individual instances.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Faithful Uncertainty Tuning (FUT)方法，通过微调让LLMs能够忠实表达不确定性，而不改变其答案分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs经常错误传达其不确定性：重复查询会产生不同答案，但生成的响应通常没有或使用不反映这种变异性的不确定性修饰语，这造成了忠实性差距。

Method: 通过增强模型样本与不确定性修饰语（如'可能'或'很可能'）来构建训练数据，这些修饰语与样本一致性对齐，只需要模型和一组提示即可，无需额外监督。

Result: 在多个模型和数据集上的开放域问答评估显示，FUT显著减少了忠实性差距，同时保持了问答准确性并引入了最小的语义分布偏移。

Conclusion: FUT是一种简单有效的方法，可以教导LLMs忠实传达不确定性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often miscommunicate their uncertainty: repeated
queries can produce divergent answers, yet generated responses are typically
unhedged or hedged in ways that do not reflect this variability. This conveys
unfaithful information about the uncertain state of the LLMs' knowledge,
creating a faithfulness gap that affects even strong LLMs. We introduce
Faithful Uncertainty Tuning (FUT): a fine-tuning approach that teaches
instruction-tuned LLMs to express uncertainty faithfully without altering their
underlying answer distribution. We construct training data by augmenting model
samples with uncertainty hedges (i.e. verbal cues such as 'possibly' or
'likely') aligned with sample consistency, requiring no supervision beyond the
model and a set of prompts. We evaluate FUT on open-domain question answering
(QA) across multiple models and datasets. Our results show that FUT
substantially reduces the faithfulness gap, while preserving QA accuracy and
introducing minimal semantic distribution shift. Further analyses demonstrate
robustness across decoding strategies, choice of hedgers, and other forms of
uncertainty expression (i.e. numerical). These findings establish FUT as a
simple and effective way to teach LLMs to communicate uncertainty faithfully.

Conclusion: 风格信号为区分机器生成文本提供了可解释的证据，StyleDecipher框架实现了准确、可解释且领域无关的检测，无需访问模型内部或标记片段。

Abstract: With the increasing integration of large language models (LLMs) into
open-domain writing, detecting machine-generated text has become a critical
task for ensuring content authenticity and trust. Existing approaches rely on
statistical discrepancies or model-specific heuristics to distinguish between
LLM-generated and human-written text. However, these methods struggle in
real-world scenarios due to limited generalization, vulnerability to
paraphrasing, and lack of explainability, particularly when facing stylistic
diversity or hybrid human-AI authorship. In this work, we propose
StyleDecipher, a robust and explainable detection framework that revisits
LLM-generated text detection using combined feature extractors to quantify
stylistic differences. By jointly modeling discrete stylistic indicators and
continuous stylistic representations derived from semantic embeddings,
StyleDecipher captures distinctive style-level divergences between human and
LLM outputs within a unified representation space. This framework enables
accurate, explainable, and domain-agnostic detection without requiring access
to model internals or labeled segments. Extensive experiments across five
diverse domains, including news, code, essays, reviews, and academic abstracts,
demonstrate that StyleDecipher consistently achieves state-of-the-art in-domain
accuracy. Moreover, in cross-domain evaluations, it surpasses existing
baselines by up to 36.30%, while maintaining robustness against adversarial
perturbations and mixed human-AI content. Further qualitative and quantitative
analysis confirms that stylistic signals provide explainable evidence for
distinguishing machine-generated text. Our source code can be accessed at

Conclusion: COSTAR-A作为一个提示框架具有适应性和可扩展性，特别适用于资源受限硬件上的计算高效AI部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to prompt design, and
making optimized prompting techniques is crucial for generating consistent,
high-quality outputs. In this study, we introduce COSTAR-A, a novel prompt
engineering framework that enhances the existing COSTAR method, which stands
for Context, Objective, Style, Tone, Audience, and Response, by adding the
'Answer' component at the end. We demonstrate that while the original COSTAR
framework improves prompt clarity and aligns outputs for larger LLMs, its
performance is less consistent with smaller, locally optimized models,
particularly in tasks that require more directive or constrained outputs.
Through a series of controlled prompt-output assessments with smaller (at most
8 billion parameters), fine-tuned models, we found that COSTAR-A can enhance
the output structure and decisiveness of localized LLMs for certain tasks,
although its effectiveness varies across models and use cases. Notably, the
Llama 3.1-8B model exhibited performance improvements when prompted with
COSTAR-A compared to COSTAR alone. These findings emphasize the adaptability
and scalability of COSTAR-A as a prompting framework, particularly in
computationally efficient AI deployments on resource-constrained hardware.

*Chaoxu Pang,Yixuan Cao,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出PARO框架，通过让LLM学习任务特定的推理模式来自动生成推理轨迹，从而大幅减少人工标注成本，在模式化推理任务中达到与10倍规模人工标注相当的SFT+RLVR性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SFT+RLVR范式需要昂贵的人工标注推理轨迹，该研究旨在探索如何在模式化推理任务中大幅降低标注成本而不影响推理性能。

Method: 提出PARO框架，让LLM学习任务特定的推理模式，自动生成与模式对齐的推理轨迹，无需人工标注完整的推理轨迹。

Result: PARO生成的推理轨迹在SFT+RLVR训练中达到与10倍规模人工标注相当的推理性能。

Conclusion: 在模式化推理任务中，大规模人工标注可以被仅需有限人工监督的LLM自动标注所替代，推理模式而非标注数量是性能的关键决定因素。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning
capabilities under the widely adopted SFT+RLVR paradigm, which first performs
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on human-annotated reasoning trajectories
(rationales) to establish initial reasoning behaviors, then applies
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize the model
using verifiable signals without golden rationales. However, annotating
high-quality rationales for the SFT stage remains prohibitively expensive. This
paper investigates when and how rationale annotation costs can be substantially
reduced without compromising reasoning performance. We identify a broad class
of problems, termed patterned reasoning tasks, where reasoning follows a fixed,
procedural strategy consistent across instances. Although instances vary in
content such as domain knowledge, factual information, or numeric values, the
solution derives from applying a shared reasoning pattern. We argue that the
success of SFT+RLVR on such tasks primarily stems from its ability to enable
models to internalize these reasoning patterns. Using numerical semantic
matching as a representative task, we provide both causal and behavioral
evidence showing that reasoning patterns rather than the quantity or quality of
rationales are the key determinant of performance. Building on these insights,
we propose Pattern-Aware LLMs as Rationale AnnOtators (PARO), a simple yet
effective framework that enables LLMs to generate rationales aligned with
task-specific reasoning patterns without requiring human rationale annotations.
Experiments show that PARO-generated rationales achieve comparable SFT+RLVR
performance to human rationales that are 10 times larger. These results suggest
that large-scale human rationale annotations can be replaced with LLM-based
automatic annotations requiring only limited human supervision over reasoning
patterns.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出生成空间大小(GSS)概念，通过GSSBench评估框架分析LLM在开放生成任务中的校准问题，发现特征值评分能有效检测幻觉，并展示了GSS在检测提示歧义、解释推理过程和引导多样化输出方面的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在开放生成任务中的校准问题：创造性任务输出过于同质化，事实性任务产生多样化但错误的幻觉响应。

Method: 提出有效生成空间大小(GSS)概念，构建GSSBench任务套件评估不同指标，使用模型内部特征分析任务表示。

Result: 发现幻觉检测指标（特别是EigenScore）优于标准多样性和不确定性量化指标，仅使用模型内部特征即可提供可解释的洞察。

Conclusion: GSS概念统一了LLM的两种失效模式，在检测提示歧义、解释推理过程和引导多样化输出方面具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Different open-ended generation tasks require different degrees of output
diversity. However, current LLMs are often miscalibrated. They collapse to
overly homogeneous outputs for creative tasks and hallucinate diverse but
incorrect responses for factual tasks. We argue that these two failure modes
are unified by, and can both be addressed by, the notion of effective
generation space size (GSS) -- the set of semantically distinct outputs a model
considers for a prompt. We present GSSBench, a task suite of prompt pairs with
ground-truth GSS relationships to assess different metrics and understand where
models diverge from desired behavior. We find that hallucination detection
metrics, particularly EigenScore, consistently outperform standard diversity
and uncertainty quantification metrics, while using only model internals,
providing interpretable insights into a model's internal task representations.
We demonstrate three applications of GSS: (1) detecting prompt ambiguity and
predicting clarification questions for better grounding, (2) interpreting
overthinking and underthinking in reasoning models, and (3) steering models to
expand their generation space to yield high-quality and diverse outputs.

Motivation: 当前全模态语言模型在捕捉和描述细粒度细节方面的能力仍有局限，存在细节与幻觉共增长的问题。

Method: 提出Omni-Detective代理数据生成管道，集成工具调用来自主生成高细节、低幻觉的多模态数据；基于此训练Audio-Captioner和Omni-Captioner模型；设计Omni-Cloze评估基准。

Result: Audio-Captioner在MMAU和MMAR上表现最佳，超越Gemini 2.5 Flash，与Gemini 2.5 Pro相当；Omni-Captioner在VDC上达到SOTA，在video-SALMONN 2上实现细节与幻觉的最佳平衡。

Conclusion: Omni-Detective能有效生成高质量细节描述，Omni-Cloze在评估细节描述方面具有优越性，为全模态细粒度感知提供了系统解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-grained perception of multimodal information is critical for advancing
human-AI interaction. With recent progress in audio-visual technologies, Omni
Language Models (OLMs), capable of processing audio and video signals in
parallel, have emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving richer
understanding and reasoning. However, their capacity to capture and describe
fine-grained details remains limited explored. In this work, we present a
systematic and comprehensive investigation of omni detailed perception from the
perspectives of the data pipeline, models, and benchmark. We first identify an
inherent "co-growth" between detail and hallucination in current OLMs. To
address this, we propose Omni-Detective, an agentic data generation pipeline
integrating tool-calling, to autonomously produce highly detailed yet minimally
hallucinatory multimodal data. Based on the data generated with Omni-Detective,
we train two captioning models: Audio-Captioner for audio-only detailed
perception, and Omni-Captioner for audio-visual detailed perception. Under the
cascade evaluation protocol, Audio-Captioner achieves the best performance on
MMAU and MMAR among all open-source models, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash and
delivering performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Pro. On existing detailed
captioning benchmarks, Omni-Captioner sets a new state-of-the-art on VDC and
achieves the best trade-off between detail and hallucination on the
video-SALMONN 2 testset. Given the absence of a dedicated benchmark for omni
detailed perception, we design Omni-Cloze, a novel cloze-style evaluation for
detailed audio, visual, and audio-visual captioning that ensures stable,
efficient, and reliable assessment. Experimental results and analysis
demonstrate the effectiveness of Omni-Detective in generating high-quality
detailed captions, as well as the superiority of Omni-Cloze in evaluating such
detailed captions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究扩展了语言模型归纳偏好的研究，采用广义范畴语法构建人工语言，评估语言模型对未见长句的泛化能力，发现类型学上合理的词序更容易被语言模型泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展现有关于语言模型归纳偏好的研究，从两个角度改进：采用更贴近自然语言的广义范畴语法，以及更关注语言模型对未见长句的泛化能力。

Method: 使用广义范畴语法构建人工语言，覆盖无界依赖和轻度上下文敏感结构等自然语言特征，评估语言模型对未见长句的处理能力。

Result: 类型学上合理的词序更容易被语言模型进行生产性泛化，实验范式得出了更清晰的结论。

Conclusion: 语言模型确实具有归纳偏好，更倾向于泛化类型学上常见的语法结构，广义范畴语法能更好地捕捉自然语言特征。

Abstract: Whether language models (LMs) have inductive biases that favor typologically
frequent grammatical properties over rare, implausible ones has been
investigated, typically using artificial languages (ALs) (White and Cotterell,
2021; Kuribayashi et al., 2024). In this paper, we extend these works from two
perspectives. First, we extend their context-free AL formalization by adopting
Generalized Categorial Grammar (GCG) (Wood, 2014), which allows ALs to cover
attested but previously overlooked constructions, such as unbounded dependency
and mildly context-sensitive structures. Second, our evaluation focuses more on
the generalization ability of LMs to process unseen longer test sentences.
Thus, our ALs better capture features of natural languages and our experimental
paradigm leads to clearer conclusions -- typologically plausible word orders
tend to be easier for LMs to productively generalize.

Motivation: 评估语言模型对话自然度具有挑战性，因为'自然度'概念多样且缺乏可扩展的量化指标。

Method: 引入DGRC方法：分割对话作为提示，使用语言模型生成子部分续写，重新组合对话和续写，比较重组序列的可能性。

Result: 语言模型偏好继续讨论核心内容，指令调优模型此偏好更强。当存在相关线索时，模型会减弱对核心内容的偏好。

Conclusion: DGRC方法能减轻语言模型分析中的偏见，系统测试话语敏感行为，指令调优虽未进一步放大调节模式，但反映了成功对话动态的特征。

Abstract: Evaluating the naturalness of dialogue in language models (LMs) is not
trivial: notions of 'naturalness' vary, and scalable quantitative metrics
remain limited. This study leverages the linguistic notion of 'at-issueness' to
assess dialogue naturalness and introduces a new method: Divide, Generate,
Recombine, and Compare (DGRC). DGRC (i) divides a dialogue as a prompt, (ii)
generates continuations for subparts using LMs, (iii) recombines the dialogue
and continuations, and (iv) compares the likelihoods of the recombined
sequences. This approach mitigates bias in linguistic analyses of LMs and
enables systematic testing of discourse-sensitive behavior. Applying DGRC, we
find that LMs prefer to continue dialogue on at-issue content, with this effect
enhanced in instruct-tuned models. They also reduce their at-issue preference
when relevant cues (e.g., "Hey, wait a minute") are present. Although
instruct-tuning does not further amplify this modulation, the pattern reflects
a hallmark of successful dialogue dynamics.

Motivation: 当前基于de Saussure和Chomsky理论的语言学评论对LLMs的批评往往是推测性和非建设性的，作者认为需要转向更实用的经验主义框架。

Method: 采用Witold Mańczak的经验主义语言学框架，将语言定义为实际使用内容的总和，强调使用频率作为核心原则，重新评估LLMs的能力。

Result: 基于Mańczak框架，论文挑战了先前对LLMs的批评，并为语言模型的设计、评估和解释提供了建设性指导。

Conclusion: 经验主义语言学框架为理解和改进LLMs提供了更实用和建设性的视角，强调语言的实际使用而非抽象理论结构。

Abstract: Linguistic commentary on LLMs, heavily influenced by the theoretical
frameworks of de Saussure and Chomsky, is often speculative and unproductive.
Critics challenge whether LLMs can legitimately model language, citing the need
for "deep structure" or "grounding" to achieve an idealized linguistic
"competence." We argue for a radical shift in perspective towards the
empiricist principles of Witold Ma\'nczak, a prominent general and historical
linguist. He defines language not as a "system of signs" or a "computational
system of the brain" but as the totality of all that is said and written. Above
all, he identifies frequency of use of particular language elements as
language's primary governing principle. Using his framework, we challenge prior
critiques of LLMs and provide a constructive guide for designing, evaluating,
and interpreting language models.

TL;DR: Dr.LLM是一个可改造的框架，通过轻量级路由模块让预训练LLM动态跳过、执行或重复层，在保持准确性的同时提高推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM对所有token都经过所有transformer层，导致简单查询浪费计算，复杂查询缺乏深度推理灵活性。现有自适应深度方法依赖昂贵推理时搜索或架构改动，且往往牺牲准确性。

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛树搜索(MCTS)生成高质量层配置作为监督信号，训练轻量级路由模块。采用窗口池化稳定路由、焦点损失与类别平衡、瓶颈MLP路由器等技术处理类别不平衡和长序列问题。

Result: 在ARC和DART任务上准确率提升达+3.4%，平均每样本节省5层。路由模块在跨域任务上仅损失0.85%准确率，同时保持效率，比现有路由方法提升达+7.7%。

Conclusion: Dr.LLM证明通过显式监督的路由器可以改造冻结LLM，实现预算感知、准确性驱动的推理，无需修改基础权重。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) process every token through all layers of a
transformer stack, causing wasted computation on simple queries and
insufficient flexibility for harder ones that need deeper reasoning.
Adaptive-depth methods can improve efficiency, but prior approaches rely on
costly inference-time search, architectural changes, or large-scale retraining,
and in practice often degrade accuracy despite efficiency gains. We introduce
Dr.LLM, Dynamic routing of Layers for LLMs, a retrofittable framework that
equips pretrained models with lightweight per-layer routers deciding to skip,
execute, or repeat a block. Routers are trained with explicit supervision:
using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we derive high-quality layer
configurations that preserve or improve accuracy under a compute budget. Our
design, windowed pooling for stable routing, focal loss with class balancing,
and bottleneck MLP routers, ensures robustness under class imbalance and long
sequences. On ARC (logic) and DART (math), Dr.LLM improves accuracy by up to
+3.4%p while saving 5 layers per example on average. Routers generalize to
out-of-domain tasks (MMLU, GSM8k, AIME, TruthfulQA, SQuADv2, GPQA, PIQA,
AGIEval) with only 0.85% accuracy drop while retaining efficiency, and
outperform prior routing methods by up to +7.7%p. Overall, Dr.LLM shows that
explicitly supervised routers retrofit frozen LLMs for budget-aware,
accuracy-driven inference without altering base weights.

Result: 实验结果表明，所提方法有效减少了高程噪声

Conclusion: 该方法提高了地形数据的安全性和可靠性，对未来月球任务具有重要意义

Abstract: As global efforts to explore the Moon intensify, the need for high-quality 3D
lunar maps becomes increasingly critical-particularly for long-distance
missions such as NASA's Endurance mission concept, in which a rover aims to
traverse 2,000 km across the South Pole-Aitken basin. Kaguya TC (Terrain
Camera) images, though globally available at 10 m/pixel, suffer from altitude
inaccuracies caused by stereo matching errors and JPEG-based compression
artifacts. This paper presents a method to improve the quality of 3D maps
generated from Kaguya TC images, focusing on mitigating the effects of
compression-induced noise in disparity maps. We analyze the compression
behavior of Kaguya TC imagery, and identify systematic disparity noise
patterns, especially in darker regions. In this paper, we propose an approach
to enhance 3D map quality by reducing residual noise in disparity images
derived from compressed images. Our experimental results show that the proposed
approach effectively reduces elevation noise, enhancing the safety and
reliability of terrain data for future lunar missions.

TL;DR: CLIP在视觉语言模型中优于DINO的原因主要来自语言监督而非训练数据量，CLIP擅长文本密集型任务，DINO在视觉中心任务上略胜一筹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究CLIP在视觉语言模型中优于自监督模型DINO的原因，是源于语言监督还是更大的训练数据量。

Method: 在控制条件下预训练CLIP和DINO（相同架构、数据集和训练配置），分析嵌入特征，并在20个VQA基准上评估它们在视觉语言模型中的表现。

Result: CLIP捕获高级语义（如对象类别、文本），DINO对低级特征（如颜色、风格）更敏感；CLIP在文本密集型任务中表现优异，DINO在视觉中心任务上略优。

Conclusion: 语言监督是CLIP优势的关键因素，为视觉编码器设计和视觉语言模型性能提供了科学见解。

Abstract: CLIP outperforms self-supervised models like DINO as vision encoders for
vision-language models (VLMs), but it remains unclear whether this advantage
stems from CLIP's language supervision or its much larger training data. To
disentangle these factors, we pre-train CLIP and DINO under controlled settings
-- using the same architecture, dataset, and training configuration --
achieving similar ImageNet accuracy. Embedding analysis shows that CLIP
captures high-level semantics (e.g., object categories, text), while DINO is
more responsive to low-level features like colors and styles. When integrated
into VLMs and evaluated on 20 VQA benchmarks, CLIP excels at text-intensive
tasks, while DINO slightly outperforms on vision-centric ones. Variants of
language supervision (e.g., sigmoid loss, pre-trained language encoders) yield
limited gains. Our findings provide scientific insights into vision encoder
design and its impact on VLM performance.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has transformed vision encoder training in
general domains but remains underutilized in medical imaging due to limited

each model to specialize more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate
that VideoLLaMA is particularly effective in temporal reasoning, achieving a
CIDEr score of 1.1001, while Qwen2.5-VL excels in visual understanding with a

Abstract: Accurately estimating the 3D layout of rooms is a crucial task in computer
vision, with potential applications in robotics, augmented reality, and
interior design. This paper proposes a novel model, PanoTPS-Net, to estimate
room layout from a single panorama image. Leveraging a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) and incorporating a Thin Plate Spline (TPS) spatial
transformation, the architecture of PanoTPS-Net is divided into two stages:
First, a convolutional neural network extracts the high-level features from the
input images, allowing the network to learn the spatial parameters of the TPS
transformation. Second, the TPS spatial transformation layer is generated to
warp a reference layout to the required layout based on the predicted
parameters. This unique combination empowers the model to properly predict room
layouts while also generalizing effectively to both cuboid and non-cuboid
layouts. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets and comparisons
with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method. The results underscore the model's accuracy in room layout estimation
and emphasize the compatibility between the TPS transformation and panorama
images. The robustness of the model in handling both cuboid and non-cuboid room
layout estimation is evident with a 3DIoU value of 85.49, 86.16, 81.76, and
91.98 on PanoContext, Stanford-2D3D, Matterport3DLayout, and ZInD datasets,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模3D环境中的空间推理面临场景杂乱、遮挡和需要精确空间理解的挑战，现有模型依赖局部外观且缺乏显式空间基础，泛化能力不足

Method: 将掩码维度（边界框坐标）嵌入输入提示，使模型能够推理对象几何和布局；针对四个问题类别进行微调；在训练集中向GPT响应添加规范化答案

Result: 在公共排行榜上获得73.0606的最终得分，总体排名第4

Conclusion: 结构化提示丰富和针对性优化在推进现实工业环境空间推理方面是有效的

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in large-scale 3D environments such as warehouses remains a
significant challenge for vision-language systems due to scene clutter,
occlusions, and the need for precise spatial understanding. Existing models
often struggle with generalization in such settings, as they rely heavily on
local appearance and lack explicit spatial grounding. In this work, we
introduce a dedicated spatial reasoning framework for the Physical AI Spatial
Intelligence Warehouse dataset introduced in the Track 3 2025 AI City
Challenge. Our approach enhances spatial comprehension by embedding mask
dimensions in the form of bounding box coordinates directly into the input
prompts, enabling the model to reason over object geometry and layout. We
fine-tune the framework across four question categories namely: Distance
Estimation, Object Counting, Multi-choice Grounding, and Spatial Relation
Inference using task-specific supervision. To further improve consistency with
the evaluation system, normalized answers are appended to the GPT response
within the training set. Our comprehensive pipeline achieves a final score of
73.0606, placing 4th overall on the public leaderboard. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of structured prompt enrichment and targeted
optimization in advancing spatial reasoning for real-world industrial
environments.

*Leili Barekatain,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了不同Vision Transformer架构和预训练策略在医学影像中的可解释性，发现DINO结合Grad-CAM能提供最忠实和定位准确的可视化解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学影像中，模型决策的可解释性直接影响临床信任和采用。Vision Transformers虽然性能优异，但其复杂的注意力机制给可解释性带来挑战。

Method: 使用Gradient Attention Rollout和Grad-CAM方法，对ViT、DeiT、DINO和Swin Transformer等不同架构进行定量和定性分析，应用于外周血细胞分类和乳腺超声图像分类任务。

Result: DINO结合Grad-CAM在所有数据集中提供最忠实和定位准确的可视化解释。Grad-CAM产生类别区分性强且空间精确的热图，而Gradient Attention Rollout产生更分散的激活。即使在误分类情况下，DINO with Grad-CAM也能突出显示误导模型的临床相关形态特征。

Conclusion: 通过提高模型透明度，这项研究支持Vision Transformers可靠且可解释地集成到关键医学诊断工作流程中。

Abstract: Understanding model decisions is crucial in medical imaging, where
interpretability directly impacts clinical trust and adoption. Vision
Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in
diagnostic imaging; however, their complex attention mechanisms pose challenges
to explainability. This study evaluates the explainability of different Vision
Transformer architectures and pre-training strategies - ViT, DeiT, DINO, and
Swin Transformer - using Gradient Attention Rollout and Grad-CAM. We conduct
both quantitative and qualitative analyses on two medical imaging tasks:
peripheral blood cell classification and breast ultrasound image
classification. Our findings indicate that DINO combined with Grad-CAM offers
the most faithful and localized explanations across datasets. Grad-CAM
consistently produces class-discriminative and spatially precise heatmaps,
while Gradient Attention Rollout yields more scattered activations. Even in
misclassification cases, DINO with Grad-CAM highlights clinically relevant
morphological features that appear to have misled the model. By improving model
transparency, this research supports the reliable and explainable integration
of ViTs into critical medical diagnostic workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下伪装物体检测面临两个关键挑战：水下图像退化（低对比度和颜色失真）和海洋生物的自然伪装。传统图像增强技术难以恢复退化图像的关键特征，而陆地场景的伪装物体检测方法因未考虑水下光学特性而无法适应水下环境。

Conclusion: APGNet通过自适应先验引导机制有效解决了水下伪装物体检测中的图像退化和伪装问题，在水下环境中表现出优越的检测性能。

Abstract: Detecting camouflaged objects in underwater environments is crucial for
marine ecological research and resource exploration. However, existing methods
face two key challenges: underwater image degradation, including low contrast
and color distortion, and the natural camouflage of marine organisms.
Traditional image enhancement techniques struggle to restore critical features
in degraded images, while camouflaged object detection (COD) methods developed
for terrestrial scenes often fail to adapt to underwater environments due to
the lack of consideration for underwater optical characteristics.
  To address these issues, we propose APGNet, an Adaptive Prior-Guided Network,
which integrates a Siamese architecture with a novel prior-guided mechanism to
enhance robustness and detection accuracy. First, we employ the Multi-Scale
Retinex with Color Restoration (MSRCR) algorithm for data augmentation,
generating illumination-invariant images to mitigate degradation effects.
Second, we design an Extended Receptive Field (ERF) module combined with a
Multi-Scale Progressive Decoder (MPD) to capture multi-scale contextual
information and refine feature representations. Furthermore, we propose an
adaptive prior-guided mechanism that hierarchically fuses position and boundary
priors by embedding spatial attention in high-level features for coarse
localization and using deformable convolution to refine contours in low-level
features.
  Extensive experimental results on two public MAS datasets demonstrate that
our proposed method APGNet outperforms 15 state-of-art methods under widely
used evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: VidMP3通过运动表示学习有效解决了视频编辑中的时序一致性和身份保持问题，为创作者提供了更好的编辑灵活性。

Abstract: Motion-preserved video editing is crucial for creators, particularly in
scenarios that demand flexibility in both the structure and semantics of
swapped objects. Despite its potential, this area remains underexplored.
Existing diffusion-based editing methods excel in structure-preserving tasks,
using dense guidance signals to ensure content integrity. While some recent
methods attempt to address structure-variable editing, they often suffer from
issues such as temporal inconsistency, subject identity drift, and the need for
human intervention. To address these challenges, we introduce VidMP3, a novel
approach that leverages pose and position priors to learn a generalized motion
representation from source videos. Our method enables the generation of new
videos that maintain the original motion while allowing for structural and
semantic flexibility. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate
the superiority of our approach over existing methods. The code will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/sandeep-sm/VidMP3.

because of the high cost of human labor and in some cases impossible. The
purpose of this paper is to discuss Domain Adaptation and various methods to
implement it. The main idea is to use a model trained on a particular dataset
to predict on data from a different domain of the same kind, for example - a
model trained on paintings of airplanes predicting on real images of airplanes

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved audio-driven
human video generation, surpassing traditional methods in both quality and
controllability. However, existing approaches still face challenges in lip-sync
accuracy, temporal coherence for long video generation, and multi-character
animation. In this work, we propose a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based
framework for generating lifelike talking videos of arbitrary length, and
introduce a training-free method for multi-character audio-driven animation.
First, we employ a LoRA-based training strategy combined with a position shift
inference approach, which enables efficient long video generation while
preserving the capabilities of the foundation model. Moreover, we combine
partial parameter updates with reward feedback to enhance both lip
synchronization and natural body motion. Finally, we propose a training-free
approach, Mask Classifier-Free Guidance (Mask-CFG), for multi-character
animation, which requires no specialized datasets or model modifications and
supports audio-driven animation for three or more characters. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving high-quality, temporally coherent, and multi-character
audio-driven video generation in a simple, efficient, and cost-effective
manner.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应双网络(ADNet)，包含EG-Restormer用于严重模糊QR码恢复和LENet用于轻度模糊快速去模糊，通过边缘引导注意力块嵌入显式边缘先验，显著提升QR码解码率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法很少显式利用QR码高度结构化模式和锐利边缘的先验，而QR码去模糊的关键目标是确保成功解码而非感知质量。

Method: 提出边缘引导注意力块(EGAB)将显式边缘先验嵌入Transformer架构，基于此开发EG-Restormer用于严重模糊恢复，设计轻量级LENet用于轻度模糊快速处理，并集成到自适应双网络(ADNet)中根据模糊程度动态选择网络。

Result: 大量实验表明EG-Restormer和ADNet在QR码去模糊任务上达到最先进性能，同时保持有竞争力的速度。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法通过显式利用QR码边缘先验和自适应网络选择机制，在资源受限的移动设备上实现了高效的QR码去模糊和解码。

Abstract: Unlike general image deblurring that prioritizes perceptual quality, QR code
deblurring focuses on ensuring successful decoding. QR codes are characterized
by highly structured patterns with sharp edges, a robust prior for restoration.
Yet existing deep learning methods rarely exploit these priors explicitly. To
address this gap, we propose the Edge-Guided Attention Block (EGAB), which
embeds explicit edge priors into a Transformer architecture. Based on EGAB, we
develop Edge-Guided Restormer (EG-Restormer), an effective network that
significantly boosts the decoding rate of severely blurred QR codes. For mildly
blurred inputs, we design the Lightweight and Efficient Network (LENet) for
fast deblurring. We further integrate these two networks into an Adaptive
Dual-network (ADNet), which dynamically selects the suitable network based on
input blur severity, making it ideal for resource-constrained mobile devices.
Extensive experiments show that our EG-Restormer and ADNet achieve
state-of-the-art performance with a competitive speed. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于预训练扩散模型的3D场景重建方法存在两个关键问题：缺乏可靠的几何监督导致重建质量差，以及缺乏有效机制缓解生成图像中的多视角不一致性，导致形状-外观模糊和几何质量下降。

Method: 利用平面结构普遍性生成精确度量尺度深度图，提供可靠监督；将几何引导融入生成流程，改进可见性掩码估计、指导新视角选择，并使用视频扩散模型增强多视角一致性进行修复。

Conclusion: 准确几何是有效利用生成模型增强3D场景重建的基本前提，通过几何引导方法能够实现准确一致的场景补全，在多种场景下展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in leveraging generative prior from pre-trained
diffusion models for 3D scene reconstruction, existing methods still face two
critical limitations. First, due to the lack of reliable geometric supervision,
they struggle to produce high-quality reconstructions even in observed regions,
let alone in unobserved areas. Second, they lack effective mechanisms to
mitigate multi-view inconsistencies in the generated images, leading to severe
shape-appearance ambiguities and degraded scene geometry. In this paper, we
identify accurate geometry as the fundamental prerequisite for effectively
exploiting generative models to enhance 3D scene reconstruction. We first
propose to leverage the prevalence of planar structures to derive accurate
metric-scale depth maps, providing reliable supervision in both observed and
unobserved regions. Furthermore, we incorporate this geometry guidance
throughout the generative pipeline to improve visibility mask estimation, guide
novel view selection, and enhance multi-view consistency when inpainting with
video diffusion models, resulting in accurate and consistent scene completion.
Extensive experiments on Replica, ScanNet++, and DeepBlending show that our
method consistently outperforms existing baselines in both geometry and
appearance reconstruction, particularly for unobserved regions. Moreover, our
method naturally supports single-view inputs and unposed videos, with strong
generalizability in both indoor and outdoor scenarios with practical real-world
applicability. The project page is available at

TL;DR: 提出DRL框架解决非排练类增量学习中的三个难题：模型复杂度增长、表示空间不连续变化、阶段优化与全局推理不一致。通过IPA网络和DAS监督实现高效增量学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预训练模型在类增量学习中的三个核心挑战：模型复杂度随类别增加而增长、增量阶段间表示空间变化不连续、阶段优化与全局推理目标不一致。

Method: 使用增量并行适配器(IPA)网络，在预训练模型基础上学习轻量级适配器，通过传输门实现表示能力的继承和传播。设计解耦锚点监督(DAS)，分别约束正负样本与虚拟锚点的距离来对齐特征空间。

Result: 在六个基准测试上，DRL在整个CIL过程中持续优于其他最先进方法，同时在训练和推理阶段都保持高效率。

Conclusion: DRL框架通过IPA网络和DAS监督有效解决了类增量学习中的关键挑战，实现了高效且持续的性能提升。

Abstract: With the excellent representation capabilities of Pre-Trained Models (PTMs),
remarkable progress has been made in non-rehearsal Class-Incremental Learning
(CIL) research. However, it remains an extremely challenging task due to three
conundrums: increasingly large model complexity, non-smooth representation
shift during incremental learning and inconsistency between stage-wise
sub-problem optimization and global inference. In this work, we propose the
Discriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework to specifically address
these challenges. To conduct incremental learning effectively and yet
efficiently, the DRL's network, called Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA)
network, is built upon a PTM and increasingly augments the model by learning a
lightweight adapter with a small amount of parameter learning overhead in each
incremental stage. The adapter is responsible for adapting the model to new
classes, it can inherit and propagate the representation capability from the
current model through parallel connection between them by a transfer gate. As a
result, this design guarantees a smooth representation shift between different
incremental stages. Furthermore, to alleviate inconsistency and enable
comparable feature representations across incremental stages, we design the
Decoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS). It decouples constraints of positive and
negative samples by respectively comparing them with the virtual anchor. This
decoupling promotes discriminative representation learning and aligns the
feature spaces learned at different stages, thereby narrowing the gap between
stage-wise local optimization over a subset of data and global inference across
all classes. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks reveal that our DRL
consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods throughout the entire
CIL period while maintaining high efficiency in both training and inference
phases.

Motivation: 现有预训练扩散引导方法依赖显式退化先验或全局统计指导，难以处理局部伪影或人脸颜色问题，需要更有效的修复方法。

Method: 使用预训练扩散模型在弱引导下生成伪参考人脸，通过人脸解析图和划痕掩码选择性修复破损区域，采用分阶段监督：结构引导贯穿去噪过程，颜色细化在后期步骤进行。

Result: 构建了包含300张真实老照片的VintageFace基准数据集，SSDiff在感知质量、保真度和区域可控性方面优于现有GAN和扩散方法。

Conclusion: SSDiff方法通过自监督选择性引导扩散模型有效解决了老照片人脸修复问题，在多个指标上表现优异，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Old-photo face restoration poses significant challenges due to compounded
degradations such as breakage, fading, and severe blur. Existing pre-trained
diffusion-guided methods either rely on explicit degradation priors or global
statistical guidance, which struggle with localized artifacts or face color. We
propose Self-Supervised Selective-Guided Diffusion (SSDiff), which leverages
pseudo-reference faces generated by a pre-trained diffusion model under weak
guidance. These pseudo-labels exhibit structurally aligned contours and natural
colors, enabling region-specific restoration via staged supervision: structural
guidance applied throughout the denoising process and color refinement in later
steps, aligned with the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion. By incorporating
face parsing maps and scratch masks, our method selectively restores breakage
regions while avoiding identity mismatch. We further construct VintageFace, a
300-image benchmark of real old face photos with varying degradation levels.
SSDiff outperforms existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods in perceptual
quality, fidelity, and regional controllability. Code link:

Result: 实验结果表明ImageSentinel能有效检测未经授权的数据集使用，同时为授权应用保持生成质量。

Conclusion: ImageSentinel为解决RAIG系统中视觉数据集保护问题提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Image Generation (RAIG) has
raised significant concerns about the unauthorized use of private image
datasets. While these systems have shown remarkable capabilities in enhancing
generation quality through reference images, protecting visual datasets from
unauthorized use in such systems remains a challenging problem. Traditional
digital watermarking approaches face limitations in RAIG systems, as the
complex feature extraction and recombination processes fail to preserve
watermark signals during generation. To address these challenges, we propose
ImageSentinel, a novel framework for protecting visual datasets in RAIG. Our
framework synthesizes sentinel images that maintain visual consistency with the
original dataset. These sentinels enable protection verification through
randomly generated character sequences that serve as retrieval keys. To ensure
seamless integration, we leverage vision-language models to generate the
sentinel images. Experimental results demonstrate that ImageSentinel
effectively detects unauthorized dataset usage while preserving generation
quality for authorized applications. Code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法能够适应任意参数化的脉冲响应，在具有非理想脉冲响应函数的真实系统中表现良好

Abstract: Single-photon cameras are becoming increasingly popular in time-of-flight 3D
imaging because they can time-tag individual photons with extreme resolution.
However, their performance is susceptible to hardware limitations, such as
system bandwidth, maximum laser power, sensor data rates, and in-sensor memory
and compute resources. Compressive histograms were recently introduced as a
solution to the challenge of data rates through an online in-sensor compression
of photon timestamp data. Although compressive histograms work within limited
in-sensor memory and computational resources, they underperform when subjected
to real-world illumination hardware constraints. To address this, we present a
constrained optimization approach for designing practical coding functions for
compressive single-photon 3D imaging. Using gradient descent, we jointly
optimize an illumination and coding matrix (i.e., the coding functions) that
adheres to hardware constraints. We show through extensive simulations that our
coding functions consistently outperform traditional coding designs under both
bandwidth and peak power constraints. This advantage is particularly pronounced
in systems constrained by peak power. Finally, we show that our approach adapts
to arbitrary parameterized impulse responses by evaluating it on a real-world
system with a non-ideal impulse response function.

Abstract: Generalist visual captioning goes beyond a simple appearance description
task, but requires integrating a series of visual cues into a caption and
handling various visual domains. In this task, current open-source models
present a large performance gap with commercial ones, which limits various
applications such as data synthesis. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes
CapFlow, a novel multi-agent collaboration workflow. CapFlow demonstrates for
the first time that, by capitalizing on open-source models, it is possible to
achieve caption quality on par with GPT-4.1 in various domains with an 89.5%
reduction in costs. By leveraging CapFlow as the data synthesizer, we produce
high-quality visual captions from image and video domains at scale, and obtain
a generalist visual captioner via fine-tuning, namely MetaCaptioner. Through
extensive experiments, we show that MetaCaptioner not only achieves comparable
captioning capabilities with commercial models but also reaches top-tier
multimodal performance in the open-source community. We hope CapFlow and
MetaCaptioner can benefit future multimodal research by providing a strong and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 远程生理测量需要收集用户隐私敏感信息，且现有非接触式测量方法依赖带标签的客户端数据，这在实际部署中面临隐私保护和标签缺失的挑战。

Method: 提出联邦无监督域泛化协议FUDG和FedHUG框架，包含最小偏差聚合模块和全局分布感知学习控制器，动态调整聚合权重和客户端训练策略。

Result: 在RGB视频和毫米波雷达的生理参数估计中，该方法优于现有最先进技术。

Conclusion: FedHUG框架有效解决了联邦学习中的异构非IID特征和标签分布偏差问题，为隐私保护的远程生理测量提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Remote physiological measurement gained wide attention, while it requires
collecting users' privacy-sensitive information, and existing contactless
measurements still rely on labeled client data. This presents challenges when
we want to further update real-world deployed models with numerous user data
lacking labels. To resolve these challenges, we instantiate a new protocol
called Federated Unsupervised Domain Generalization (FUDG) in this work.
Subsequently, the \textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{H}eterogeneous
\textbf{U}nsupervised \textbf{G}eneralization (\textbf{FedHUG}) framework is
proposed and consists of: (1) Minimal Bias Aggregation module dynamically
adjusts aggregation weights based on prior-driven bias evaluation to cope with
heterogeneous non-IID features from multiple domains. (2) The Global
Distribution-aware Learning Controller parameterizes the label distribution and
dynamically manipulates client-specific training strategies, thereby mitigating
the server-client label distribution skew and long-tail issue. The proposal
shows superior performance across state-of-the-art techniques in estimation
with either RGB video or mmWave radar. The code will be released.

*Jiahuan Zhou,Chao Zhu,Zhenyu Cui,Zichen Liu,Xu Zou,Gang Hua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出KFF方法，通过类感知域知识融合与分裂解决持续测试时适应中的灾难性遗忘问题，动态积累判别性历史知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CTTA方法通过恢复初始模型或重用历史模型来减少灾难性遗忘，但会导致新知识学习不足和有害历史知识干扰，造成性能下降。

Method: 设计域知识分裂模块自适应分离新域知识，减轻旧域负知识影响；设计域知识融合模块以最小成本将分裂知识合并到现有知识池中，采用贪心知识动态合并策略。

Result: 在ImageNet-C数据集上的大量实验验证了所提方法相对于其他方法的有效性。

Conclusion: KFF方法通过知识融合与分裂机制，有效解决了持续测试时适应中的知识积累与遗忘平衡问题。

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to quickly fine-tune the model
during the test phase so that it can adapt to multiple unknown downstream
domain distributions without pre-acquiring downstream domain data. To this end,
existing advanced CTTA methods mainly reduce the catastrophic forgetting of
historical knowledge caused by irregular switching of downstream domain data by
restoring the initial model or reusing historical models. However, these
methods are usually accompanied by serious insufficient learning of new
knowledge and interference from potentially harmful historical knowledge,
resulting in severe performance degradation. To this end, we propose a
class-aware domain Knowledge Fusion and Fission method for continual test-time
adaptation, called KFF, which adaptively expands and merges class-aware domain
knowledge in old and new domains according to the test-time data from different
domains, where discriminative historical knowledge can be dynamically
accumulated. Specifically, considering the huge domain gap within streaming
data, a domain Knowledge FIssion (KFI) module is designed to adaptively
separate new domain knowledge from a paired class-aware domain prompt pool,
alleviating the impact of negative knowledge brought by old domains that are
distinct from the current domain. Besides, to avoid the cumulative computation
and storage overheads from continuously fissioning new knowledge, a domain
Knowledge FUsion (KFU) module is further designed to merge the fissioned new
knowledge into the existing knowledge pool with minimal cost, where a greedy
knowledge dynamic merging strategy is designed to improve the compatibility of
new and old knowledge while keeping the computational efficiency. Extensive
experiments on the ImageNet-C dataset verify the effectiveness of our proposed
method against other methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于原型的单次医学图像分割方法由于使用确定性平均特征，无法捕捉类内多样性，导致泛化能力差

Method: 提出扩散原型学习框架，包含扩散增强模块、空间感知条件机制和保守融合策略，在训练和推理阶段使用相同的扩散增强流程

Result: 在腹部MRI和CT数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提升了单次医学图像分割性能，达到新的最先进水平

Conclusion: 将原型建模为概率分布并通过扩散过程生成多样化变体，是提升单次医学图像分割鲁棒性的有效方法

Abstract: One-shot medical image segmentation faces fundamental challenges in prototype
representation due to limited annotated data and significant anatomical
variability across patients. Traditional prototype-based methods rely on
deterministic averaging of support features, creating brittle representations
that fail to capture intra-class diversity essential for robust generalization.
This work introduces Diffusion Prototype Learning (DPL), a novel framework that
reformulates prototype construction through diffusion-based feature space
exploration. DPL models one-shot prototypes as learnable probability
distributions, enabling controlled generation of diverse yet semantically
coherent prototype variants from minimal labeled data. The framework operates
through three core innovations: (1) a diffusion-based prototype enhancement
module that transforms single support prototypes into diverse variant sets via
forward-reverse diffusion processes, (2) a spatial-aware conditioning mechanism
that leverages geometric properties derived from prototype feature statistics,
and (3) a conservative fusion strategy that preserves prototype fidelity while
maximizing representational diversity. DPL ensures training-inference
consistency by using the same diffusion enhancement and fusion pipeline in both
phases. This process generates enhanced prototypes that serve as the final
representations for similarity calculations, while the diffusion process itself
acts as a regularizer. Extensive experiments on abdominal MRI and CT datasets
demonstrate significant improvements respectively, establishing new
state-of-the-art performance in one-shot medical image segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于视频理解的状态空间提示（SSP）方法，通过帧内聚集和帧间传播模块来聚合和传播视频中的关键时空信息，显著提升了视频分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的预训练状态空间模型在视频分类中虽然效率高，但顺序压缩的视觉提示令牌无法有效捕获视频的时空上下文信息，限制了空间和时间信息的有效传播。

Method: 设计了帧内聚集（IFG）模块来聚合每帧内的空间关键信息，以及帧间传播（IFS）模块来在不同帧间传播判别性时空信息，通过自适应平衡和压缩帧内和帧间的关键时空信息来互补传播判别性信息。

Result: 在四个视频基准数据集上的广泛实验验证，SSP方法平均比现有SOTA方法提升2.76%，同时减少了微调参数的开销。

Conclusion: SSP方法通过有效聚合和传播视频中的关键时空信息，显著提升了视频理解性能，同时保持了参数效率。

Abstract: Recently, pre-trained state space models have shown great potential for video
classification, which sequentially compresses visual tokens in videos with
linear complexity, thereby improving the processing efficiency of video data
while maintaining high performance. To apply powerful pre-trained models to
downstream tasks, prompt learning is proposed to achieve efficient downstream
task adaptation with only a small number of fine-tuned parameters. However, the
sequentially compressed visual prompt tokens fail to capture the spatial and
temporal contextual information in the video, thus limiting the effective
propagation of spatial information within a video frame and temporal
information between frames in the state compression model and the extraction of
discriminative information. To tackle the above issue, we proposed a State
Space Prompting (SSP) method for video understanding, which combines
intra-frame and inter-frame prompts to aggregate and propagate key
spatiotemporal information in the video. Specifically, an Intra-Frame Gathering
(IFG) module is designed to aggregate spatial key information within each
frame. Besides, an Inter-Frame Spreading (IFS) module is designed to spread
discriminative spatio-temporal information across different frames. By
adaptively balancing and compressing key spatio-temporal information within and
between frames, our SSP effectively propagates discriminative information in
videos in a complementary manner. Extensive experiments on four video benchmark
datasets verify that our SSP significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods by
2.76% on average while reducing the overhead of fine-tuning parameters.

TL;DR: UniGS是一个基于3D高斯泼溅的统一地图表示和可微分框架，用于高保真多模态3D重建。它通过CUDA加速的光栅化管道同时渲染RGB图像、深度图、表面法线和语义逻辑，并通过可微分的射线-椭球体交点实现深度渲染，优化旋转和尺度属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D重建方法在多模态重建方面存在局限性，无法同时实现高保真的RGB、几何准确深度、一致表面法线和语义重建。需要开发一个统一的框架来整合这些模态，并确保几何一致性。

Method: 1) 重新设计光栅化，通过可微分的射线-椭球体交点渲染深度而非使用高斯中心；2) 推导表面法线渲染的解析梯度公式；3) 引入可学习属性实现高斯体的可微分剪枝，提高计算和存储效率。

Result: 定量和定性实验表明，UniGS在所有模态上都达到了最先进的重建精度，验证了几何感知范式的有效性。

Conclusion: UniGS提供了一个高效的多模态3D重建框架，通过几何感知的优化方法实现了高保真重建，并在所有评估模态上表现出色。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniGS, a unified map representation and
differentiable framework for high-fidelity multimodal 3D reconstruction based
on 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our framework integrates a CUDA-accelerated
rasterization pipeline capable of rendering photo-realistic RGB images,
geometrically accurate depth maps, consistent surface normals, and semantic
logits simultaneously. We redesign the rasterization to render depth via
differentiable ray-ellipsoid intersection rather than using Gaussian centers,
enabling effective optimization of rotation and scale attribute through
analytic depth gradients. Furthermore, we derive the analytic gradient
formulation for surface normal rendering, ensuring geometric consistency among
reconstructed 3D scenes. To improve computational and storage efficiency, we
introduce a learnable attribute that enables differentiable pruning of
Gaussians with minimal contribution during training. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy
across all modalities, validating the efficacy of our geometry-aware paradigm.

TL;DR: BEEP3D提出了一种端到端的3D实例分割方法，使用边界框标注作为弱监督，通过师生框架生成伪掩码，避免了传统两阶段方法的复杂性和训练时间问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 完全监督的3D实例分割方法需要密集的点级标注，成本高昂。虽然边界框标注更易获取，但存在重叠区域模糊的问题。现有两阶段方法训练复杂且无法端到端优化。

Method: 采用师生框架，教师模型作为伪标签生成器，通过指数移动平均更新。引入基于实例中心的查询精炼来增强定位，并设计了查询一致性损失和掩码特征一致性损失来对齐预测与伪掩码。

Result: 在ScanNetV2和S3DIS数据集上的实验表明，BEEP3D在保持计算效率的同时，达到了与最先进弱监督方法相当或更优的性能。

Conclusion: BEEP3D提供了一种有效的端到端解决方案，能够在仅使用边界框标注的情况下实现高质量的3D实例分割，显著降低了标注成本。

Abstract: 3D instance segmentation is crucial for understanding complex 3D
environments, yet fully supervised methods require dense point-level
annotations, resulting in substantial annotation costs and labor overhead. To
mitigate this, box-level annotations have been explored as a weaker but more
scalable form of supervision. However, box annotations inherently introduce
ambiguity in overlapping regions, making accurate point-to-instance assignment
challenging. Recent methods address this ambiguity by generating pseudo-masks
through training a dedicated pseudo-labeler in an additional training stage.
However, such two-stage pipelines often increase overall training time and
complexity, hinder end-to-end optimization. To overcome these challenges, we
propose BEEP3D-Box-supervised End-to-End Pseudo-mask generation for 3D instance
segmentation. BEEP3D adopts a student-teacher framework, where the teacher
model serves as a pseudo-labeler and is updated by the student model via an
Exponential Moving Average. To better guide the teacher model to generate
precise pseudo-masks, we introduce an instance center-based query refinement
that enhances position query localization and leverages features near instance
centers. Additionally, we design two novel losses-query consistency loss and
masked feature consistency loss-to align semantic and geometric signals between
predictions and pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and S3DIS
datasets demonstrate that BEEP3D achieves competitive or superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods while remaining
computationally efficient.

Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法难以有效传递教师MLLM的丰富视觉感知能力，主要原因是师生模型间的视觉注意力不匹配问题。

Method: 提出CompoDistill框架，通过显式对齐学生和教师模型的视觉注意力来增强学生的视觉感知能力。

Result: 在组合推理任务上显著提升性能，同时在视觉问答任务上保持强劲表现，且在不同骨干网络上展现良好泛化性。

Conclusion: CompoDistill通过解决视觉注意力对齐问题，有效提升了学生模型的视觉感知能力，具有很好的实用价值。

Abstract: Recently, efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained
significant attention as a solution to their high computational complexity,
making them more practical for real-world applications. In this regard, the
knowledge distillation (KD) approach has emerged as a promising alternative,
which transfers the rich visual and linguistic knowledge from a larger model
(teacher) to a smaller model (student). However, we observe that existing KD
methods struggle to effectively distill the teacher MLLM's rich visual
perception abilities to the student, a challenge that has been largely
overlooked in previous studies. Through a systematic analysis, we identify
visual attention misalignment between student and teacher as the main cause of
this issue. Based on this insight, we propose CompoDistill, a novel KD
framework that explicitly aligns the student's visual attention with that of
the teacher to enhance the student's visual perception abilities. Our extensive
experiments show that CompoDistill significantly improves performance on
compositional reasoning tasks that require visual perception abilities while
maintaining strong performance on visual question answering tasks, as done in
existing studies. Furthermore, CompoDistill demonstrates effectiveness with a
more advanced backbone, highlighting its generalizability.

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving have been enabled by
training on diverse large-scale driving datasets, yet autonomous driving models
still struggle in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. The COOOL benchmark
targets this gap by encouraging hazard understanding beyond closed taxonomies,
and the 2COOOL challenge extends it to generating human-interpretable incident
reports. We present a hierarchical reasoning framework for incident report
generation from dashcam videos that integrates frame-level captioning, incident
frame detection, and fine-grained reasoning within vision-language models
(VLMs). We further improve factual accuracy and readability through model
ensembling and a Blind A/B Scoring selection protocol. On the official 2COOOL
open leaderboard, our method ranks 2nd among 29 teams and achieves the best
CIDEr-D score, producing accurate and coherent incident narratives. These
results indicate that hierarchical reasoning with VLMs is a promising direction
for accident analysis and for broader understanding of safety-critical traffic
events. The implementation and code are available at

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI, particularly in computer vision (CV), offer
new opportunities to optimize workflows across industries, including logistics
and manufacturing. However, many AI applications are limited by a lack of
expertise and resources, which forces a reliance on general-purpose models.
Success with these models often requires domain-specific data for fine-tuning,
which can be costly and inefficient. Thus, using synthetic data for fine-tuning
is a popular, cost-effective alternative to gathering real-world data. This
work investigates the impact of synthetic data on the performance of object
detection models, compared to models trained on real-world data only,
specifically within the domain of warehouse logistics. To this end, we examined
the impact of synthetic data generated using the NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator
tool on the effectiveness of object detection models in real-world scenarios.
It comprises experiments focused on pallet detection in a warehouse setting,
utilizing both real and various synthetic dataset generation strategies. Our
findings provide valuable insights into the practical applications of synthetic
image data in computer vision, suggesting that a balanced integration of
synthetic and real data can lead to robust and efficient object detection
models.

Motivation: 微表情识别因面部线索细微短暂且标注数据有限而具有挑战性。传统动态图像方法往往忽略微表情不同时间阶段的独特特征，需要更精细的相位建模。

Result: 在CASME-II、SAMM和MMEW三个基准MER数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法始终优于传统的单相位动态图像方法。

Conclusion: 明确建模时间相位信息对微表情识别至关重要，为推进MER提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial movements that typically last
less than half a second and often reveal genuine emotions. Accurately
recognizing these subtle expressions is critical for applications in
psychology, security, and behavioral analysis. However, micro-expression
recognition (MER) remains a challenging task due to the subtle and transient
nature of facial cues and the limited availability of annotated data. While
dynamic image (DI) representations have been introduced to summarize temporal
motion into a single frame, conventional DI-based methods often overlook the
distinct characteristics of different temporal phases within a
micro-expression. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel
dual-stream framework, DIANet, which leverages phase-aware dynamic images - one
encoding the onset-to-apex phase and the other capturing the apex-to-offset
phase. Each stream is processed by a dedicated convolutional neural network,
and a cross-attention fusion module is employed to adaptively integrate
features from both streams based on their contextual relevance. Extensive
experiments conducted on three benchmark MER datasets (CASME-II, SAMM, and
MMEW) demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms
conventional single-phase DI-based approaches. The results highlight the
importance of modeling temporal phase information explicitly and suggest a
promising direction for advancing MER.

Conclusion: 本研究提出了改进的VL推理数据集整理策略，通过系统化的数据干预和规模化方法显著提升了视觉语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have made them highly
effective at reasoning tasks. However, the principles underlying the
construction of performant VL reasoning training datasets remain poorly
understood. In this work, we introduce several data curation approaches and
study their impacts on VL reasoning capabilities by carefully controlling
training and evaluation setups. We analyze the effects of context (image and
question pair) sources, implement targeted data interventions, and explore
scaling up images, questions, and chain-of-thought (CoT) solutions. Our
findings reveal that (a) context source strategies significantly affect VLM
performance, (b) interventions such as auxiliary signals from image captions
and the inclusion of text-only reasoning yield substantial gains, and (c)
scaling all data dimensions (e.g., unique questions per image and unique CoTs
per image-question pair) consistently improves reasoning capability. Motivated
by these insights, we introduce HoneyBee, a large-scale, high-quality CoT
reasoning dataset with 2.5M examples consisting 350K image-question pairs. VLMs
trained with HoneyBee outperform state-of-the-art models across model sizes.
For instance, a HoneyBee-trained VLM with 3B parameters outperforms the SOTA
model and the base model by 7.8% and 24.8%, respectively, on MathVerse.
Furthermore, we propose a test-time scaling strategy that reduces decoding cost
by 73% without sacrificing accuracy. Overall, this work presents improved
strategies for VL reasoning dataset curation research.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了多标记并行预测中的结构不一致问题，在保持效率的同时显著提升了生成质量，适用于图像和视频两种模态。

Abstract: Recent advances in image and video generation have raised significant
interest from both academia and industry. A key challenge in this field is
improving inference efficiency, as model size and the number of inference steps
directly impact the commercial viability of generative models while also posing
fundamental scientific challenges. A promising direction involves combining
auto-regressive sequential token modeling with multi-token prediction per step,
reducing inference time by up to an order of magnitude. However, predicting
multiple tokens in parallel can introduce structural inconsistencies due to
token incompatibilities, as capturing complex joint dependencies during
training remains challenging. Traditionally, once tokens are sampled, there is
no mechanism to backtrack and refine erroneous predictions. We propose a method
for self-correcting image generation by iteratively refining sampled tokens. We
achieve this with a novel training scheme that injects random tokens in the
context, improving robustness and enabling token fixing during sampling. Our
method preserves the efficiency benefits of parallel token prediction while
significantly enhancing generation quality. We evaluate our approach on image
generation using the ImageNet-256 and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as on video
generation with UCF-101 and NuScenes, demonstrating substantial improvements
across both modalities.

Abstract: In the multimedia domain, Infrared Small Target Detection (ISTD) plays a
important role in drone-based multi-modality sensing. To address the dual
challenges of cross-domain shift and heteroscedastic noise perturbations in
ISTD, we propose a doubly wavelet-guided Invariance learning
framework(Ivan-ISTD). In the first stage, we generate training samples aligned
with the target domain using Wavelet-guided Cross-domain Synthesis. This
wavelet-guided alignment machine accurately separates the target background
through multi-frequency wavelet filtering. In the second stage, we introduce
Real-domain Noise Invariance Learning, which extracts real noise
characteristics from the target domain to build a dynamic noise library. The
model learns noise invariance through self-supervised loss, thereby overcoming
the limitations of distribution bias in traditional artificial noise modeling.
Finally, we create the Dynamic-ISTD Benchmark, a cross-domain dynamic
degradation dataset that simulates the distribution shifts encountered in
real-world applications. Additionally, we validate the versatility of our
method using other real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of many
quantitative metrics. In particular, Ivan-ISTD demonstrates excellent
robustness in cross-domain scenarios. The code for this work can be found at:

Result: 实验表明该方法以更少的参数实现高视频重建精度，支持视频修复和基于关键帧的时间一致性视频编辑等复杂任务。

Conclusion: 代理节点表示方法能够稳定处理视频中的动态变化，有效应对跟踪误差、长期运动、遮挡和视角变化，同时支持可控的细粒度外观编辑。

Abstract: Current video representations heavily rely on unstable and over-grained
priors for motion and appearance modelling, \emph{i.e.}, pixel-level matching
and tracking. A tracking error of just a few pixels would lead to the collapse
of the visual object representation, not to mention occlusions and large motion
frequently occurring in videos. To overcome the above mentioned vulnerability,
this work proposes spatio-temporally consistent proxy nodes to represent
dynamically changing objects/scenes in the video. On the one hand, the
hierarchical proxy nodes have the ability to stably express the multi-scale
structure of visual objects, so they are not affected by accumulated tracking
error, long-term motion, occlusion, and viewpoint variation. On the other hand,
the dynamic representation update mechanism of the proxy nodes adequately
leverages spatio-temporal priors of the video to mitigate the impact of
inaccurate trackers, thereby effectively handling drastic changes in scenes and
objects. Additionally, the decoupled encoding manner of the shape and texture
representations across different visual objects in the video facilitates
controllable and fine-grained appearance editing capability. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed representation achieves high video
reconstruction accuracy with fewer parameters and supports complex video
processing tasks, including video in-painting and keyframe-based temporally
consistent video editing.

*Yuto Yokoi,Kazuhiro Hotta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了两种新的损失函数：乘法损失和置信度自适应乘法损失，用于医学和细胞图像的语义分割，在数据稀缺情况下优于传统损失函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像由于隐私、伦理和标注成本高等原因存在数据稀缺问题，传统的交叉熵和Dice损失的加性组合对超参数敏感且在有限数据下表现不佳，需要更鲁棒和高效的训练目标。

Method: 乘法损失将交叉熵和Dice损失以乘法方式结合，基于预测置信度动态调节梯度；置信度自适应乘法损失在此基础上应用置信度驱动的指数缩放，整合预测概率和Dice系数来强调困难样本。

Result: 在细胞和医学分割基准测试中，该框架始终优于调优的加性损失函数和现有损失函数。

Conclusion: 该框架为在具有挑战性的数据限制下进行鲁棒分割提供了一种简单、有效且无需超参数调整的机制。

Abstract: We propose two novel loss functions, Multiplicative Loss and
Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss, for semantic segmentation in medical
and cellular images. Although Cross Entropy and Dice Loss are widely used,
their additive combination is sensitive to hyperparameters and often performs
suboptimally, especially with limited data. Medical images suffer from data
scarcity due to privacy, ethics, and costly annotations, requiring robust and
efficient training objectives. Our Multiplicative Loss combines Cross Entropy
and Dice losses multiplicatively, dynamically modulating gradients based on
prediction confidence. This reduces penalties for confident correct predictions
and amplifies gradients for incorrect overconfident ones, stabilizing
optimization. Building on this, Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss applies
a confidence-driven exponential scaling inspired by Focal Loss, integrating
predicted probabilities and Dice coefficients to emphasize difficult samples.
This enhances learning under extreme data scarcity by strengthening gradients
when confidence is low. Experiments on cellular and medical segmentation
benchmarks show our framework consistently outperforms tuned additive and
existing loss functions, offering a simple, effective, and hyperparameter-free
mechanism for robust segmentation under challenging data limitations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络在OOD数据上产生过度自信预测的问题，避免现有方法需要额外OOD数据集或生成假OOD图像的高成本限制。

Method: 利用ID图像的局部背景特征作为模拟OOD视觉表示，基于卷积的局部不变性提取背景特征，通过优化降低这些特征的L2范数来训练模型。

Result: 在多个标准OOD检测基准测试中验证了方法的有效性，与现有后处理方法具有广泛的组合兼容性，并达到了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种有效且低成本的OOD检测解决方案，能够显著缓解模型对OOD数据的过度自信问题。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial when deploying deep neural
networks in the real world to ensure the reliability and safety of their
applications. One main challenge in OOD detection is that neural network models
often produce overconfident predictions on OOD data. While some methods using
auxiliary OOD datasets or generating fake OOD images have shown promising OOD
detection performance, they are limited by the high costs of data collection
and training. In this study, we propose a novel and effective OOD detection
method that utilizes local background features as fake OOD features for model
training. Inspired by the observation that OOD images generally share similar
background regions with ID images, the background features are extracted from
ID images as simulated OOD visual representations during training based on the
local invariance of convolution. Through being optimized to reduce the
$L_2$-norm of these background features, the neural networks are able to
alleviate the overconfidence issue on OOD data. Extensive experiments on
multiple standard OOD detection benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our
method and its wide combinatorial compatibility with existing post-hoc methods,
with new state-of-the-art performance achieved from our method.

Motivation: 现有无监督融合方法依赖手工设计的损失函数，存在参考图像细节不足、亮度不均，以及梯度损失只关注梯度幅度的问题。

Method: 设计跨模态互补掩码模块学习模态间互补信息；提出结合拉普拉斯边缘增强和自适应直方图均衡的参考图像合成策略；引入同时约束梯度幅度和方向的角度感知损失。

Result: 在MSRS、RoadScene和M3FD数据集上的实验表明，AngularFuse明显优于现有主流方法，在挑战性场景中产生更清晰、更详细的结果。

Conclusion: AngularFuse通过同时约束梯度幅度和方向，能够保留纹理强度和正确边缘方向，展示了优越的融合能力。

Abstract: Visible-infrared image fusion is crucial in key applications such as
autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance. Its main goal is to integrate
multimodal information to produce enhanced images that are better suited for
downstream tasks. Although deep learning based fusion methods have made
significant progress, mainstream unsupervised approaches still face serious
challenges in practical applications. Existing methods mostly rely on manually
designed loss functions to guide the fusion process. However, these loss
functions have obvious limitations. On one hand, the reference images
constructed by existing methods often lack details and have uneven brightness.
On the other hand, the widely used gradient losses focus only on gradient
magnitude. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an angle-based
perception framework for spatial-sensitive image fusion (AngularFuse). At
first, we design a cross-modal complementary mask module to force the network
to learn complementary information between modalities. Then, a fine-grained
reference image synthesis strategy is introduced. By combining Laplacian edge
enhancement with adaptive histogram equalization, reference images with richer
details and more balanced brightness are generated. Last but not least, we
introduce an angle-aware loss, which for the first time constrains both
gradient magnitude and direction simultaneously in the gradient domain.
AngularFuse ensures that the fused images preserve both texture intensity and
correct edge orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the MSRS, RoadScene, and
M3FD public datasets show that AngularFuse outperforms existing mainstream
methods with clear margin. Visual comparisons further confirm that our method
produces sharper and more detailed results in challenging scenes, demonstrating
superior fusion capability.

Motivation: 现有基准主要评估一般医学任务，无法充分捕捉在脊柱等依赖视觉输入的精细领域的性能表现，需要专门的评估工具。

Method: 通过整合和标准化开源脊柱疾病数据集的图像标签对，构建包含脊柱疾病诊断和脊柱病变定位两个临床任务的VQA基准，并为每个VQA对基于视觉相似性采样具有挑战性的负选项。

Result: 对12个领先MLLMs的评估显示，这些模型在脊柱任务上表现不佳，突显了当前MLLM在脊柱领域的局限性。

Conclusion: SpineBench揭示了当前MLLM在脊柱医学应用中的不足，为未来改进提供了指导方向。

Abstract: With the increasing integration of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
into the medical field, comprehensive evaluation of their performance in
various medical domains becomes critical. However, existing benchmarks
primarily assess general medical tasks, inadequately capturing performance in
nuanced areas like the spine, which relies heavily on visual input. To address
this, we introduce SpineBench, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA)
benchmark designed for fine-grained analysis and evaluation of MLLMs in the
spinal domain. SpineBench comprises 64,878 QA pairs from 40,263 spine images,
covering 11 spinal diseases through two critical clinical tasks: spinal disease
diagnosis and spinal lesion localization, both in multiple-choice format.
SpineBench is built by integrating and standardizing image-label pairs from
open-source spinal disease datasets, and samples challenging hard negative
options for each VQA pair based on visual similarity (similar but not the same
disease), simulating real-world challenging scenarios. We evaluate 12 leading
MLLMs on SpineBench. The results reveal that these models exhibit poor
performance in spinal tasks, highlighting limitations of current MLLM in the
spine domain and guiding future improvements in spinal medicine applications.

Motivation: 解决当前动态3D城市场景重建方法在保真度和计算成本之间的权衡问题，传统方法对静态背景和安全关键对象采用均等资源分配，导致效率低下。

Method: 1. 语义引导的剪枝和正则化策略：使用混合重要性度量简化非关键场景元素，保留导航关键对象的精细细节；2. 优先级驱动的渲染管线：基于优先级的深度预传递来剔除被遮挡基元，加速最终着色计算。

Result: 在Waymo和KITTI数据集上的实验表明，PAGS实现了卓越的重建质量（特别是安全关键对象），同时显著减少训练时间，渲染速度提升至超过350 FPS。

Conclusion: PAGS通过将任务感知的语义优先级注入3D重建和渲染流程，成功解决了保真度与效率的权衡问题，为自动驾驶提供了高效的动态场景重建解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D urban scenes is crucial for autonomous driving, yet
current methods face a stark trade-off between fidelity and computational cost.
This inefficiency stems from their semantically agnostic design, which
allocates resources uniformly, treating static backgrounds and safety-critical
objects with equal importance. To address this, we introduce Priority-Adaptive
Gaussian Splatting (PAGS), a framework that injects task-aware semantic
priorities directly into the 3D reconstruction and rendering pipeline. PAGS
introduces two core contributions: (1) Semantically-Guided Pruning and
Regularization strategy, which employs a hybrid importance metric to
aggressively simplify non-critical scene elements while preserving fine-grained
details on objects vital for navigation. (2) Priority-Driven Rendering
pipeline, which employs a priority-based depth pre-pass to aggressively cull
occluded primitives and accelerate the final shading computations. Extensive
experiments on the Waymo and KITTI datasets demonstrate that PAGS achieves
exceptional reconstruction quality, particularly on safety-critical objects,
while significantly reducing training time and boosting rendering speeds to
over 350 FPS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于部分相关视频检索的双重学习框架，通过动态知识蒸馏从大规模视觉语言预训练模型向轻量级任务特定网络传递知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本-视频检索方法假设视频是经过预剪辑的短片段，但实际应用中视频通常是未剪辑的长视频，包含复杂的背景内容，因此需要处理部分相关视频检索这一更具挑战性的任务。

Method: 采用双重学习框架与动态知识蒸馏，包含一个大型教师模型和紧凑的双分支学生网络。学生网络包括继承分支（从教师模型吸收可转移知识）和探索分支（从PRVR数据集学习任务特定信息）。引入动态软目标构建机制，用自适应软目标替代硬目标监督。

Result: 在TVR、ActivityNet和Charades-STA数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的DL-DKD++框架能够有效处理部分相关视频检索任务，通过知识蒸馏和动态软目标机制提升了模型对视频与查询之间细粒度部分相关性的捕捉能力。

Abstract: Almost all previous text-to-video retrieval works ideally assume that videos
are pre-trimmed with short durations containing solely text-related content.
However, in practice, videos are typically untrimmed in long durations with
much more complicated background content. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on
the more practical yet challenging task of Partially Relevant Video Retrieval
(PRVR), which aims to retrieve partially relevant untrimmed videos with the
given query. To tackle this task, we propose a novel framework that distills
generalization knowledge from a powerful large-scale vision-language
pre-trained model and transfers it to a lightweight, task-specific PRVR
network. Specifically, we introduce a Dual Learning framework with Dynamic
Knowledge Distillation (DL-DKD++), where a large teacher model provides
supervision to a compact dual-branch student network. The student model
comprises two branches: an inheritance branch that absorbs transferable
knowledge from the teacher, and an exploration branch that learns task-specific
information from the PRVR dataset to address domain gaps. To further enhance
learning, we incorporate a dynamic soft-target construction mechanism. By
replacing rigid hard-target supervision with adaptive soft targets that evolve
during training, our method enables the model to better capture the
fine-grained, partial relevance between videos and queries. Experiment results
demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
TVR, ActivityNet, and Charades-STA datasets for PRVR. The code is available at

TL;DR: 该论文研究了视觉语言模型中的logo幻觉问题，即模型在没有可见文字的情况下仍生成品牌名称或文本内容，揭示了VLMs依赖符号先验而非真实字形感知的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在多模态推理方面取得了显著进展，但仍然容易产生幻觉，即输出结果没有基于视觉证据。本研究特别关注一个被忽视的场景：logo幻觉，即模型在logo不含可见文字的情况下仍生成品牌名称或文本内容。

Method: 使用纯符号、混合和含文字logo的精选数据集，以及具有挑战性的Hard-60子集，系统测量领先VLMs的幻觉程度。通过九种结构化扰动测试鲁棒性，并对开源LLaVA进行嵌入级分析，识别与幻觉相关的投影器维度。

Result: 研究发现幻觉在强失真情况下仍然存在，遮挡暴露了最严重的弱点。嵌入分析表明幻觉与投影器的小部分维度相关，针对性消融显著减少错误同时保持OCR准确性。VLMs通常依赖符号先验而非真实字形感知，特别是对于标志性圆形logo。

Conclusion: 投影器子空间在这种失败模式中起决定性作用。该工作提供了新颖的诊断视角和可行的缓解见解，强调投影器解耦和OCR引导解码作为构建更可信多模态系统的有前景方向。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal
reasoning; yet, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, where outputs are not
grounded in visual evidence. In this paper, we investigate a previously
overlooked setting: logo hallucination, where models generate brand names or
textual content despite logos containing no visible words. Using curated splits
of pure symbols, hybrids, and text-bearing logos, as well as the challenging
Hard-60 subset, we systematically measure hallucination across leading VLMs. We
further probe robustness through nine structured perturbations and show that
hallucinations persist even under strong distortions, with occlusion exposing
the sharpest weaknesses. Embedding-level analysis with open-weight LLaVA
demonstrates that hallucination is tied to a small subset of projector
dimensions, and targeted ablation substantially reduces errors while preserving
OCR accuracy. Together, these findings reveal that VLMs often rely on symbolic
priors rather than genuine glyph perception, particularly for iconic circular
logos, and that projector subspaces play a decisive role in this failure mode.
Our work contributes both a novel diagnostic lens and actionable mitigation
insights, highlighting projector disentanglement and OCR-guided decoding as
promising directions for building more trustworthy multimodal systems.

Abstract: This paper describes the Qualcomm AI Research solution to the RealADSim-NVS
challenge, hosted at the RealADSim Workshop at ICCV 2025. The challenge
concerns novel view synthesis in street scenes, and participants are required
to generate, starting from car-centric frames captured during some training
traversals, renders of the same urban environment as viewed from a different
traversal (e.g. different street lane or car direction). Our solution is
inspired by hybrid methods in scene generation and generative simulators
merging gaussian splatting and diffusion models, and it is composed of two
stages: First, we fit a 3D reconstruction of the scene and render novel views
as seen from the target cameras. Then, we enhance the resulting frames with a
dedicated single-step diffusion model. We discuss specific choices made in the
initialization of gaussian primitives as well as the finetuning of the enhancer
model and its training data curation. We report the performance of our model
design and we ablate its components in terms of novel view quality as measured
by PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS. On the public leaderboard reporting test results, our
proposal reaches an aggregated score of 0.432, achieving the second place

Conclusion: CurriFlow通过光流时序对齐和课程深度融合，显著提升了基于相机的3D语义场景补全性能。

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to infer complete 3D geometry and
semantics from monocular images, serving as a crucial capability for
camera-based perception in autonomous driving. However, existing SSC methods
relying on temporal stacking or depth projection often lack explicit motion
reasoning and struggle with occlusions and noisy depth supervision. We propose
CurriFlow, a novel semantic occupancy prediction framework that integrates
optical flow-based temporal alignment with curriculum-guided depth fusion.
CurriFlow employs a multi-level fusion strategy to align segmentation, visual,
and depth features across frames using pre-trained optical flow, thereby
improving temporal consistency and dynamic object understanding. To enhance
geometric robustness, a curriculum learning mechanism progressively transitions
from sparse yet accurate LiDAR depth to dense but noisy stereo depth during
training, ensuring stable optimization and seamless adaptation to real-world
deployment. Furthermore, semantic priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
provide category-agnostic supervision, strengthening voxel-level semantic
learning and spatial consistency. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI benchmark
demonstrate that CurriFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean
IoU of 16.9, validating the effectiveness of our motion-guided and
curriculum-aware design for camera-based 3D semantic scene completion.

Conclusion: 提出的动态自适应采样方法能够在减少复杂度的同时提升性能，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Although deep neural networks have provided impressive gains in performance,
these improvements often come at the cost of increased computational complexity
and expense. In many cases, such as 3D volume or video classification tasks,
not all slices or frames are necessary due to inherent redundancies. To address
this issue, we propose a novel learnable subsampling framework that can be
integrated into any neural network architecture. Subsampling, being a
nondifferentiable operation, poses significant challenges for direct adaptation
into deep learning models. While some works, have proposed solutions using the
Gumbel-max trick to overcome the problem of non-differentiability, they fall
short in a crucial aspect: they are only task-adaptive and not inputadaptive.
Once the sampling mechanism is learned, it remains static and does not adjust
to different inputs, making it unsuitable for real-world applications. To this
end, we propose an attention-guided sampling module that adapts to inputs even
during inference. This dynamic adaptation results in performance gains and
reduces complexity in deep neural network models. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on 3D medical imaging datasets from MedMNIST3D as
well as two ultrasound video datasets for classification tasks, one of them
being a challenging in-house dataset collected under real-world clinical
conditions.

Motivation: 现有最先进模型仅依赖检测单个视频帧中的装配对象状态，忽略了时间特征，导致在物体部分遮挡时模型鲁棒性和准确性受限。

Method: STORM-PSR是一个双流框架：装配状态检测流用于无遮挡视图，时空流包含空间编码器和基于transformer的时间编码器，通过弱监督预训练捕获空间表示并学习时间关系。

Result: 在MECCANO和IndustReal数据集上评估，相比先前方法，平均延迟分别减少了11.2%和26.1%。时空流不依赖无遮挡视图即可推断完成步骤。

Conclusion: STORM-PSR通过整合时空特征有效提升了程序步骤识别的性能，特别是在部分遮挡情况下，证明了时空流的重要性。

Abstract: Procedure step recognition (PSR) aims to identify all correctly completed
steps and their sequential order in videos of procedural tasks. The existing
state-of-the-art models rely solely on detecting assembly object states in
individual video frames. By neglecting temporal features, model robustness and
accuracy are limited, especially when objects are partially occluded. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Occlusion-Resilient
Modeling for Procedure Step Recognition (STORM-PSR), a dual-stream framework
for PSR that leverages both spatial and temporal features. The assembly state
detection stream operates effectively with unobstructed views of the object,
while the spatio-temporal stream captures both spatial and temporal features to
recognize step completions even under partial occlusion. This stream includes a
spatial encoder, pre-trained using a novel weakly supervised approach to
capture meaningful spatial representations, and a transformer-based temporal
encoder that learns how these spatial features relate over time. STORM-PSR is
evaluated on the MECCANO and IndustReal datasets, reducing the average delay
between actual and predicted assembly step completions by 11.2% and 26.1%,
respectively, compared to prior methods. We demonstrate that this reduction in
delay is driven by the spatio-temporal stream, which does not rely on
unobstructed views of the object to infer completed steps. The code for
STORM-PSR, along with the newly annotated MECCANO labels, is made publicly
available at https://timschoonbeek.github.io/stormpsr .

Abstract: Scene coordinate regression (SCR) models have proven to be powerful implicit
scene representations for 3D vision, enabling visual relocalization and
structure-from-motion. SCR models are trained specifically for one scene. If
training images imply insufficient multi-view constraints SCR models
degenerate. We present a probabilistic reinterpretation of training SCR models,
which allows us to infuse high-level reconstruction priors. We investigate
multiple such priors, ranging from simple priors over the distribution of
reconstructed depth values to learned priors over plausible scene coordinate
configurations. For the latter, we train a 3D point cloud diffusion model on a
large corpus of indoor scans. Our priors push predicted 3D scene points towards
plausible geometry at each training step to increase their likelihood. On three
indoor datasets our priors help learning better scene representations,
resulting in more coherent scene point clouds, higher registration rates and
better camera poses, with a positive effect on down-stream tasks such as novel
view synthesis and camera relocalization.

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型为城市基础设施监控提供了有前景的技术路径，特别是在零样本学习场景下，但该领域仍处于早期发展阶段，需要更多标准化评估和数据集支持。

Abstract: Urban monitoring of public infrastructure (such as waste bins, road signs,
vegetation, sidewalks, and construction sites) poses significant challenges due
to the diversity of objects, environments, and contextual conditions involved.
Current state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on a combination of IoT
sensors and manual inspections, which are costly, difficult to scale, and often
misaligned with citizens' perception formed through direct visual observation.
This raises a critical question: Can machines now "see" like citizens and infer
informed opinions about the condition of urban infrastructure? Vision-Language
Models (VLMs), which integrate visual understanding with natural language
reasoning, have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in processing
complex visual information, turning them into a promising technology to address
this challenge. This systematic review investigates the role of VLMs in urban
monitoring, with particular emphasis on zero-shot applications. Following the
PRISMA methodology, we analyzed 32 peer-reviewed studies published between 2021
and 2025 to address four core research questions: (1) What urban monitoring
tasks have been effectively addressed using VLMs? (2) Which VLM architectures
and frameworks are most commonly used and demonstrate superior performance? (3)
What datasets and resources support this emerging field? (4) How are VLM-based
applications evaluated, and what performance levels have been reported?

### [109] [Low-Field Magnetic Resonance Image Quality Enhancement using a Conditional Flow Matching Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12408)
*Huu Tien Nguyen,Ahmed Karam Eldaly*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于条件流匹配(CFM)的图像质量迁移框架，用于从低场MRI重建高场质量的图像，在性能和泛化能力上达到先进水平且参数更少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低场磁共振成像(LF-MRI)虽然成本低且便携，但信噪比低、诊断质量差，需要一种方法在不增加昂贵基础设施的情况下提升图像质量。

Method: 使用条件流匹配(CFM)框架，通过直接回归最优速度场，在噪声分布和目标数据分布之间学习连续流，替代传统的迭代采样或对抗目标。

Result: CFM在低场MRI到高场质量图像的重建任务中达到最先进性能，对分布内和分布外数据都具有鲁棒泛化能力，且使用的参数显著少于竞争深度学习方法。

Conclusion: CFM作为MRI重建的强大可扩展工具，在资源有限的临床环境中具有重要应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for image quality transfer based on
conditional flow matching (CFM). Unlike conventional generative models that
rely on iterative sampling or adversarial objectives, CFM learns a continuous
flow between a noise distribution and target data distributions through the
direct regression of an optimal velocity field. We evaluate this approach in
the context of low-field magnetic resonance imaging (LF-MRI), a rapidly
emerging modality that offers affordable and portable scanning but suffers from
inherently low signal-to-noise ratio and reduced diagnostic quality. Our
framework is designed to reconstruct high-field-like MR images from their
corresponding low-field inputs, thereby bridging the quality gap without
requiring expensive infrastructure. Experiments demonstrate that CFM not only
achieves state-of-the-art performance, but also generalizes robustly to both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. Importantly, it does so while
utilizing significantly fewer parameters than competing deep learning methods.
These results underline the potential of CFM as a powerful and scalable tool
for MRI reconstruction, particularly in resource-limited clinical environments.

*Jialong Zuo,Yongtai Deng,Lingdong Kong,Jingkang Yang,Rui Jin,Yiwei Zhang,Nong Sang,Liang Pan,Ziwei Liu,Changxin Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoLucy是一个基于深度记忆回溯框架的长视频理解系统，通过分层记忆结构和迭代回溯机制解决现有方法在时序上下文理解和关键信息保留方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于LLM的代理系统在长视频理解中面临两个主要问题：1) 在单个帧上进行建模和推理，难以捕捉连续帧的时序上下文；2) 为降低密集帧级标注成本而采用稀疏帧采样，可能丢失关键信息。

Method: VideoLucy采用受人类回忆过程启发的分层记忆结构，具有渐进粒度。通过基于代理的迭代回溯机制，系统性地挖掘视频范围内与问题相关的深度记忆，直到收集到足够信息以提供自信答案。

Result: 基于开源模型构建的VideoLucy在多个长视频理解基准测试中显著优于最先进方法，性能甚至超过了GPT-4o等最新专有模型。

Conclusion: VideoLucy通过深度记忆回溯框架有效解决了长视频理解中的时序理解和细节保留问题，在多个基准测试中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that agent-based systems leveraging large language
models (LLMs) for key information retrieval and integration have emerged as a
promising approach for long video understanding. However, these systems face
two major challenges. First, they typically perform modeling and reasoning on
individual frames, struggling to capture the temporal context of consecutive
frames. Second, to reduce the cost of dense frame-level captioning, they adopt
sparse frame sampling, which risks discarding crucial information. To overcome
these limitations, we propose VideoLucy, a deep memory backtracking framework
for long video understanding. Inspired by the human recollection process from
coarse to fine, VideoLucy employs a hierarchical memory structure with
progressive granularity. This structure explicitly defines the detail level and
temporal scope of memory at different hierarchical depths. Through an
agent-based iterative backtracking mechanism, VideoLucy systematically mines
video-wide, question-relevant deep memories until sufficient information is
gathered to provide a confident answer. This design enables effective temporal
understanding of consecutive frames while preserving critical details. In
addition, we introduce EgoMem, a new benchmark for long video understanding.
EgoMem is designed to comprehensively evaluate a model's ability to understand
complex events that unfold over time and capture fine-grained details in
extremely long videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
VideoLucy. Built on open-source models, VideoLucy significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on multiple long video understanding benchmarks,
achieving performance even surpassing the latest proprietary models such as
GPT-4o. Our code and dataset will be made publicly at
https://videolucy.github.io

*Shaoyang Zhou,Yingshu Li,Yunyi Liu,Lingqiao Liu,Lei Wang,Luping Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提供了纵向放射学报告生成(LRRG)领域的首次全面综述，重点关注如何利用历史影像数据来改进胸部X光报告的自动生成，填补了现有调查主要关注单图像方法的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胸部X光成像在现代医学中应用广泛，给放射科医生带来巨大工作负担。现有方法主要依赖单张图像，无法捕捉纵向上下文来生成临床准确的比较陈述，因此需要系统性地研究如何整合历史影像数据来改进报告生成。

Method: 通过系统回顾纵向放射学报告生成的研究，分析数据集构建策略、报告生成架构设计、纵向特定评估协议，并总结不同消融研究的结果。

Result: 分析表明纵向信息和架构设计选择在提升模型性能中起关键作用，总结了当前研究的五大主要局限性。

Conclusion: 为这一新兴领域的发展奠定了基础，并指出了未来发展的有前景方向。

Abstract: Chest Xray imaging is a widely used diagnostic tool in modern medicine, and
its high utilization creates substantial workloads for radiologists. To
alleviate this burden, vision language models are increasingly applied to
automate Chest Xray radiology report generation (CXRRRG), aiming for clinically
accurate descriptions while reducing manual effort. Conventional approaches,
however, typically rely on single images, failing to capture the longitudinal
context necessary for producing clinically faithful comparison statements.
Recently, growing attention has been directed toward incorporating longitudinal
data into CXR RRG, enabling models to leverage historical studies in ways that
mirror radiologists diagnostic workflows. Nevertheless, existing surveys
primarily address single image CXRRRG and offer limited guidance for
longitudinal settings, leaving researchers without a systematic framework for
model design. To address this gap, this survey provides the first comprehensive
review of longitudinal radiology report generation (LRRG). Specifically, we
examine dataset construction strategies, report generation architectures
alongside longitudinally tailored designs, and evaluation protocols
encompassing both longitudinal specific measures and widely used benchmarks. We
further summarize LRRG methods performance, alongside analyses of different
ablation studies, which collectively highlight the critical role of
longitudinal information and architectural design choices in improving model
performance. Finally, we summarize five major limitations of current research
and outline promising directions for future development, aiming to lay a
foundation for advancing this emerging field.

TL;DR: MS-GAGA是一个两阶段框架，用于在黑盒设置下生成可转移且视觉不可察觉的对抗样本攻击深度伪造检测器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现有对抗攻击方法在跨模型迁移性和视觉不可察觉性之间的权衡不足，提出一个能同时优化这两个关键指标的框架。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：第一阶段使用双流攻击模块（MNTD-PGD和SG-PGD）生成对抗候选；第二阶段通过度量感知选择模块基于成功率和结构相似性评估候选样本。

Result: 在未见过的检测器上实现了比现有最先进攻击方法高27%的误分类率。

Conclusion: MS-GAGA通过联合优化可迁移性和不可察觉性，显著提升了对抗样本在黑盒设置下的攻击效果。

Abstract: We present MS-GAGA (Metric-Selective Guided Adversarial Generation Attack), a
two-stage framework for crafting transferable and visually imperceptible
adversarial examples against deepfake detectors in black-box settings. In Stage
1, a dual-stream attack module generates adversarial candidates: MNTD-PGD
applies enhanced gradient calculations optimized for small perturbation
budgets, while SG-PGD focuses perturbations on visually salient regions. This
complementary design expands the adversarial search space and improves
transferability across unseen models. In Stage 2, a metric-aware selection
module evaluates candidates based on both their success against black-box
models and their structural similarity (SSIM) to the original image. By jointly
optimizing transferability and imperceptibility, MS-GAGA achieves up to 27%
higher misclassification rates on unseen detectors compared to state-of-the-art
attacks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种早期融合框架，在数据增强前结合文本和视觉特征，以保持空间一致性，解决多模态学习中数据增强破坏图像-文本对齐的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在医学影像中依赖数据增强，但传统增强方法（如旋转、翻转）会破坏图像与文本的空间对齐，影响文本引导图像分割的性能。

Method: 采用早期融合框架，在数据增强前融合文本和视觉特征；设计轻量级生成器将文本嵌入投影到视觉空间，弥合语义差距。

Result: 在三个医学影像任务和四个分割框架上评估，实现了最先进的性能；生成伪图像的视觉化显示准确的区域定位。

Conclusion: 提出的早期融合方法有效解决了多模态学习中数据增强带来的空间对齐问题，在医学图像分割任务中取得了优异结果。

Abstract: Deep learning relies heavily on data augmentation to mitigate limited data,
especially in medical imaging. Recent multimodal learning integrates text and
images for segmentation, known as referring or text-guided image segmentation.
However, common augmentations like rotation and flipping disrupt spatial
alignment between image and text, weakening performance. To address this, we
propose an early fusion framework that combines text and visual features before
augmentation, preserving spatial consistency. We also design a lightweight
generator that projects text embeddings into visual space, bridging semantic
gaps. Visualization of generated pseudo-images shows accurate region
localization. Our method is evaluated on three medical imaging tasks and four
segmentation frameworks, achieving state-of-the-art results. Code is publicly
available on GitHub: https://github.com/11yxk/MedSeg_EarlyFusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Bi-Stage 3D高斯泼溅(BSGS)框架，从运动模糊图像中准确重建3D场景，通过两阶段优化和子帧梯度聚合策略解决现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于3DGS的去模糊方法性能受限，因为过度依赖相机姿态精度，且无法有效控制运动模糊引起的错误高斯基元密集化。

Method: BSGS包含相机姿态精炼和全局刚性变换两阶段优化，采用子帧梯度聚合策略缓解多子帧梯度冲突，并引入时空双阶段优化策略动态调整基元密集化阈值。

Result: 综合实验验证了所提出去模糊方法的有效性，并显示其在性能上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: BSGS框架能够有效解决运动模糊图像中的3D场景重建问题，通过两阶段优化策略显著提升了重建质量。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has exhibited remarkable capabilities in 3D scene
reconstruction.However, reconstructing high-quality 3D scenes from
motion-blurred images caused by camera motion poses a significant challenge.The
performance of existing 3DGS-based deblurring methods are limited due to their
inherent mechanisms, such as extreme dependence on the accuracy of camera poses
and inability to effectively control erroneous Gaussian primitives
densification caused by motion blur.To solve these problems, we introduce a
novel framework, Bi-Stage 3D Gaussian Splatting, to accurately reconstruct 3D
scenes from motion-blurred images.BSGS contains two stages. First, Camera Pose
Refinement roughly optimizes camera poses to reduce motion-induced distortions.
Second, with fixed rough camera poses, Global RigidTransformation further
corrects motion-induced blur distortions.To alleviate multi-subframe gradient
conflicts, we propose a subframe gradient aggregation strategy to optimize both
stages.Furthermore, a space-time bi-stage optimization strategy is introduced
to dynamically adjust primitive densification thresholds and prevent premature
noisy Gaussian generation in blurred regions. Comprehensive experiments verify
the effectiveness of our proposed deblurring method and show its superiority
over the state of the arts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VAD是一种轻量级的无网络方法，通过Voronoi辅助扩散从无定向点云直接计算无符号距离场，解决了现有神经方法在数值稳定性、计算成本和可控性方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的神经方法在学习无符号距离场时存在数值不稳定、计算成本高和可控性有限的问题，需要一种更稳定高效的方法来处理各种拓扑结构的3D形状。

Method: 首先基于两个Voronoi几何准则为输入点分配双向法向量，然后扩散对齐的法向量形成近似UDF梯度场，最后通过积分恢复最终的UDF。

Result: 实验表明VAD能够稳健处理水密和开放表面，以及复杂的非流形和非可定向几何体，同时保持计算效率和稳定性。

Conclusion: VAD提供了一种计算高效、数值稳定的无符号距离场计算方法，能够处理各种复杂几何拓扑结构。

Abstract: Unsigned Distance Fields (UDFs) provide a flexible representation for 3D
shapes with arbitrary topology, including open and closed surfaces, orientable
and non-orientable geometries, and non-manifold structures. While recent neural
approaches have shown promise in learning UDFs, they often suffer from
numerical instability, high computational cost, and limited controllability. We
present a lightweight, network-free method, Voronoi-Assisted Diffusion (VAD),
for computing UDFs directly from unoriented point clouds. Our approach begins
by assigning bi-directional normals to input points, guided by two
Voronoi-based geometric criteria encoded in an energy function for optimal
alignment. The aligned normals are then diffused to form an approximate UDF
gradient field, which is subsequently integrated to recover the final UDF.
Experiments demonstrate that VAD robustly handles watertight and open surfaces,
as well as complex non-manifold and non-orientable geometries, while remaining
computationally efficient and stable.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分数扩散模型的人体运动生成方法，仅通过特征空间归一化和分析推导的损失权重，就能达到最先进的无条件运动生成效果，同时直接生成运动和形状，避免后处理形状恢复。


<details>

Motivation: 现有方法依赖过度参数化的输入特征和辅助损失来改进结果，但这些策略对于扩散模型匹配人体运动分布并非必需。

Method: 使用分数扩散模型，结合特征空间归一化和分析推导的L2分数匹配损失权重，直接生成运动和形状。

Result: 在无条件人体运动生成任务上达到了与最先进方法相当的结果。

Conclusion: 证明了通过理论驱动的组件设计，扩散模型无需复杂辅助策略即可有效生成人体运动。

Abstract: Recent work has explored a range of model families for human motion
generation, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs), and diffusion-based models. Despite their differences, many
methods rely on over-parameterized input features and auxiliary losses to
improve empirical results. These strategies should not be strictly necessary
for diffusion models to match the human motion distribution. We show that on
par with state-of-the-art results in unconditional human motion generation are
achievable with a score-based diffusion model using only careful feature-space
normalization and analytically derived weightings for the standard L2
score-matching loss, while generating both motion and shape directly, thereby
avoiding slow post hoc shape recovery from joints. We build the method step by
step, with a clear theoretical motivation for each component, and provide
targeted ablations demonstrating the effectiveness of each proposed addition in
isolation.

Motivation: 模仿学习泛化能力差，强化学习样本效率低且收敛不稳定，需要结合两者优势。

Method: 提出竞争性双策略框架CoIRL-AD，让模仿学习和强化学习智能体在训练中交互，通过竞争机制促进知识交换并避免梯度冲突。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，碰撞率比基线降低18%，在长尾场景中表现出更强的泛化能力和性能提升。

Conclusion: CoIRL-AD通过竞争机制有效结合模仿学习和强化学习，显著提升了自动驾驶模型的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving models trained solely with imitation learning
(IL) often suffer from poor generalization. In contrast, reinforcement learning
(RL) promotes exploration through reward maximization but faces challenges such
as sample inefficiency and unstable convergence. A natural solution is to
combine IL and RL. Moving beyond the conventional two-stage paradigm (IL
pretraining followed by RL fine-tuning), we propose CoIRL-AD, a competitive
dual-policy framework that enables IL and RL agents to interact during
training. CoIRL-AD introduces a competition-based mechanism that facilitates
knowledge exchange while preventing gradient conflicts. Experiments on the
nuScenes dataset show an 18% reduction in collision rate compared to baselines,
along with stronger generalization and improved performance on long-tail
scenarios. Code is available at: https://github.com/SEU-zxj/CoIRL-AD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB跟踪算法依赖空间外观特征，在无人机视角下因小目标、遮挡和复杂背景而性能下降。多光谱图像提供光谱反射率信息，能增强目标区分能力，但缺乏专用数据集阻碍了该领域发展。

Method: 1) 构建大规模多光谱无人机数据集MMOT；2) 提出轻量级光谱3D-Stem模块集成光谱特征；3) 方向感知卡尔曼滤波器用于精确状态估计；4) 端到端方向自适应transformer架构。

Result: 多光谱输入相比RGB基线显著提升了跟踪性能，特别是对小目标和密集物体效果更明显。

Conclusion: MMOT基准和提出的多光谱跟踪方案将推动无人机多光谱多目标跟踪研究的发展，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Drone-based multi-object tracking is essential yet highly challenging due to
small targets, severe occlusions, and cluttered backgrounds. Existing RGB-based
tracking algorithms heavily depend on spatial appearance cues such as color and
texture, which often degrade in aerial views, compromising reliability.
Multispectral imagery, capturing pixel-level spectral reflectance, provides
crucial cues that enhance object discriminability under degraded spatial
conditions. However, the lack of dedicated multispectral UAV datasets has
hindered progress in this domain. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMOT, the
first challenging benchmark for drone-based multispectral multi-object
tracking. It features three key characteristics: (i) Large Scale - 125 video
sequences with over 488.8K annotations across eight categories; (ii)
Comprehensive Challenges - covering diverse conditions such as extreme small
targets, high-density scenarios, severe occlusions, and complex motion; and
(iii) Precise Oriented Annotations - enabling accurate localization and reduced
ambiguity under aerial perspectives. To better extract spectral features and
leverage oriented annotations, we further present a multispectral and
orientation-aware MOT scheme adapting existing methods, featuring: (i) a
lightweight Spectral 3D-Stem integrating spectral features while preserving
compatibility with RGB pretraining; (ii) an orientation-aware Kalman filter for
precise state estimation; and (iii) an end-to-end orientation-adaptive
transformer. Extensive experiments across representative trackers consistently
show that multispectral input markedly improves tracking performance over RGB
baselines, particularly for small and densely packed objects. We believe our
work will advance drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking research. Our
MMOT, code, and benchmarks are publicly available at

Motivation: 现有基于交叉注意力机制的方法主要捕获全局交互，难以维持逐步的时间对齐，这限制了基于时序输入信号的人类运动生成质量。

Method: 引入基于Mamba的Temporally Conditional Mamba模型，将条件信息整合到Mamba块的循环动态中，实现更好的时序对齐运动生成。

Result: 在多种人类运动任务上的广泛实验表明，该方法在时间对齐、运动真实感和条件一致性方面显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: Temporally Conditional Mamba通过改进的条件整合机制有效解决了时序对齐问题，为基于时序条件的人类运动生成提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Learning human motion based on a time-dependent input signal presents a
challenging yet impactful task with various applications. The goal of this task
is to generate or estimate human movement that consistently reflects the
temporal patterns of conditioning inputs. Existing methods typically rely on
cross-attention mechanisms to fuse the condition with motion. However, this
approach primarily captures global interactions and struggles to maintain
step-by-step temporal alignment. To address this limitation, we introduce
Temporally Conditional Mamba, a new mamba-based model for human motion
generation. Our approach integrates conditional information into the recurrent
dynamics of the Mamba block, enabling better temporally aligned motion. To
validate the effectiveness of our method, we evaluate it on a variety of human
motion tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model significantly
improves temporal alignment, motion realism, and condition consistency over
state-of-the-art approaches. Our project page is available at

Abstract: We present a zero-shot segmentation approach for agricultural imagery that
leverages Plantnet, a large-scale plant classification model, in conjunction
with its DinoV2 backbone and the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Rather than
collecting and annotating new datasets, our method exploits Plantnet's
specialized plant representations to identify plant regions and produce coarse
segmentation masks. These masks are then refined by SAM to yield detailed
segmentations. We evaluate on four publicly available datasets of various
complexity in terms of contrast including some where the limited size of the
training data and complex field conditions often hinder purely supervised
methods. Our results show consistent performance gains when using
Plantnet-fine-tuned DinoV2 over the base DinoV2 model, as measured by the
Jaccard Index (IoU). These findings highlight the potential of combining
foundation models with specialized plant-centric models to alleviate the
annotation bottleneck and enable effective segmentation in diverse agricultural
scenarios.

TL;DR: LayerSync是一种领域无关的方法，通过使用扩散模型自身的中间表征作为内在指导来提升生成质量和训练效率，无需外部监督或预训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明扩散模型的生成质量与学习到的表征相关，外部指导能加速训练。本文重新思考这一范式，旨在利用模型内部不同层表征质量的差异，让语义丰富的表征指导较弱表征，减少对外部监督的需求。

Method: LayerSync是一种自给自足的即插即用正则化项，通过正则化扩散模型与其自身中间表征来工作。它利用不同层表征质量的差异，让语义丰富的表征作为内在指导来提升较弱表征，无需额外开销。

Result: 在图像生成任务上广泛评估，并扩展到音频、视频和运动生成等其他领域。实验表明能一致提升生成质量和训练效率，例如在ImageNet数据集上加速基于流的transformer训练8.75倍，生成质量提升23.6%。

Conclusion: LayerSync是一种有效的领域无关方法，通过利用扩散模型内部表征的层级差异实现自我指导，显著提升训练效率和生成质量，且无需外部资源。

Abstract: We propose LayerSync, a domain-agnostic approach for improving the generation
quality and the training efficiency of diffusion models. Prior studies have
highlighted the connection between the quality of generation and the
representations learned by diffusion models, showing that external guidance on
model intermediate representations accelerates training. We reconceptualize
this paradigm by regularizing diffusion models with their own intermediate
representations. Building on the observation that representation quality varies
across diffusion model layers, we show that the most semantically rich
representations can act as an intrinsic guidance for weaker ones, reducing the
need for external supervision. Our approach, LayerSync, is a self-sufficient,
plug-and-play regularizer term with no overhead on diffusion model training and
generalizes beyond the visual domain to other modalities. LayerSync requires no
pretrained models nor additional data. We extensively evaluate the method on
image generation and demonstrate its applicability to other domains such as
audio, video, and motion generation. We show that it consistently improves the
generation quality and the training efficiency. For example, we speed up the
training of flow-based transformer by over 8.75x on ImageNet dataset and
improved the generation quality by 23.6%. The code is available at

Conclusion: 该框架首次成功实现了无需预训练VAE或扩散模型的高分辨率图像一致性模型训练，在生成质量和效率方面均取得显著提升。

Abstract: Pixel-space generative models are often more difficult to train and generally
underperform compared to their latent-space counterparts, leaving a persistent
performance and efficiency gap. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-stage
training framework that closes this gap for pixel-space diffusion and
consistency models. In the first stage, we pre-train encoders to capture
meaningful semantics from clean images while aligning them with points along
the same deterministic sampling trajectory, which evolves points from the prior
to the data distribution. In the second stage, we integrate the encoder with a
randomly initialized decoder and fine-tune the complete model end-to-end for
both diffusion and consistency models. Our training framework demonstrates
strong empirical performance on ImageNet dataset. Specifically, our diffusion
model reaches an FID of 2.04 on ImageNet-256 and 2.35 on ImageNet-512 with 75
number of function evaluations (NFE), surpassing prior pixel-space methods by a
large margin in both generation quality and efficiency while rivaling leading
VAE-based models at comparable training cost. Furthermore, on ImageNet-256, our
consistency model achieves an impressive FID of 8.82 in a single sampling step,
significantly surpassing its latent-space counterpart. To the best of our
knowledge, this marks the first successful training of a consistency model
directly on high-resolution images without relying on pre-trained VAEs or
diffusion models.

TL;DR: 提出了多模态潜在推理方法IVT-LR，通过在潜在空间中结合视觉和文本信息进行推理，无需显式推理步骤标注，在提升准确率的同时显著降低推理延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态推理方法依赖显式推理步骤，需要大量视觉-文本标注且推理延迟高，需要更高效的多模态推理方法。

Method: 提出IVT-LR方法，在潜在空间中融合潜在文本（前一步隐藏状态）和潜在视觉（选定图像嵌入）来表示推理步骤，采用渐进式多阶段训练策略。

Result: 在M3CoT和ScienceQA数据集上，IVT-LR方法平均准确率提升5.45%，推理速度提升超过5倍。

Conclusion: IVT-LR通过多模态潜在推理有效解决了现有方法的标注依赖和延迟问题，实现了准确率和效率的双重提升。

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning aims to enhance the capabilities of MLLMs by
incorporating intermediate reasoning steps before reaching the final answer. It
has evolved from text-only reasoning to the integration of visual information,
enabling the thought process to be conveyed through both images and text.
Despite its effectiveness, current multimodal reasoning methods depend on
explicit reasoning steps that require labor-intensive vision-text annotations
and inherently introduce significant inference latency. To address these
issues, we introduce multimodal latent reasoning with the advantages of
multimodal representation, reduced annotation, and inference efficiency. To
facilicate it, we propose Interleaved Vision-Text Latent Reasoning (IVT-LR),
which injects both visual and textual information in the reasoning process
within the latent space. Specifically, IVT-LR represents each reasoning step by
combining two implicit parts: latent text (the hidden states from the previous
step) and latent vision (a set of selected image embeddings). We further
introduce a progressive multi-stage training strategy to enable MLLMs to
perform the above multimodal latent reasoning steps. Experiments on M3CoT and
ScienceQA demonstrate that our IVT-LR method achieves an average performance
increase of 5.45% in accuracy, while simultaneously achieving a speed increase
of over 5 times compared to existing approaches. Code available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法往往忽略水下成像物理原理或简单将水下图像退化现象视为干扰因素，未能充分利用其包含的宝贵信息

Method: 基于整流流的框架，将水下物理成像信息作为显式先验直接融入网络训练过程，并引入时间维度建模

Result: 在USOD10K数据集上，WaterFlow在S_m指标上获得0.072的提升

Conclusion: 该方法有效且优越，代码将在接受后发布

Abstract: Underwater Salient Object Detection (USOD) faces significant challenges,
including underwater image quality degradation and domain gaps. Existing
methods tend to ignore the physical principles of underwater imaging or simply
treat degradation phenomena in underwater images as interference factors that
must be eliminated, failing to fully exploit the valuable information they
contain. We propose WaterFlow, a rectified flow-based framework for underwater
salient object detection that innovatively incorporates underwater physical
imaging information as explicit priors directly into the network training
process and introduces temporal dimension modeling, significantly enhancing the
model's capability for salient object identification. On the USOD10K dataset,
WaterFlow achieves a 0.072 gain in S_m, demonstrating the effectiveness and
superiority of our method. The code will be published after the acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本去噪方法训练时间长，且依赖噪声独立性和零均值假设，限制了在真实世界复杂噪声场景中的有效性。

Method: 利用图像纹理在不同频带间的位置相似性和内容一致性，而噪声不具备此特性，开发了跨频一致性损失和超轻量网络实现图像去噪。

Result: 在多个真实世界图像数据集上的实验表明，ZSCFC在计算效率和去噪性能上优于其他最先进的零样本方法。

Conclusion: ZSCFC方法能够有效处理真实世界去噪问题，不依赖噪声分布假设，具有较高的计算效率和去噪性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot denoisers address the dataset dependency of deep-learning-based
denoisers, enabling the denoising of unseen single images. Nonetheless,
existing zero-shot methods suffer from long training times and rely on the
assumption of noise independence and a zero-mean property, limiting their
effectiveness in real-world denoising scenarios where noise characteristics are
more complicated. This paper proposes an efficient and effective method for
real-world denoising, the Zero-Shot denoiser based on Cross-Frequency
Consistency (ZSCFC), which enables training and denoising with a single noisy
image and does not rely on assumptions about noise distribution. Specifically,
image textures exhibit position similarity and content consistency across
different frequency bands, while noise does not. Based on this property, we
developed cross-frequency consistency loss and an ultralight network to realize
image denoising. Experiments on various real-world image datasets demonstrate
that our ZSCFC outperforms other state-of-the-art zero-shot methods in terms of
computational efficiency and denoising performance.

Motivation: 现有最先进的人体网格恢复方法依赖大型非分层视觉变换器，计算成本高。研究旨在开发简单高效的模型，利用分层视觉基础模型的早期阶段特征来平衡精度和效率。

Method: 构建了三种轻量级HMR2.0变体，并提出使用Swin Transformer、GroupMixFormer和VMamba等分层视觉基础模型的前两到三个阶段作为编码器，替代传统的全阶段模型。

Result: 评估了27个基于分层视觉基础模型的HMR和HPE模型，发现仅使用前两到三个阶段就能达到与全阶段模型相当的性能，且在精度和计算效率之间表现出更好的权衡。

Conclusion: 分层视觉基础模型的早期阶段能够有效用于人体网格恢复和姿态估计任务，提供比现有轻量级替代方案更优的精度-效率平衡。

Abstract: In this work, we aim to develop simple and efficient models for human mesh
recovery (HMR) and its predecessor task, human pose estimation (HPE).
State-of-the-art HMR methods, such as HMR2.0 and its successors, rely on large,
non-hierarchical vision transformers as encoders, which are inherited from the
corresponding HPE models like ViTPose. To establish baselines across varying
computational budgets, we first construct three lightweight HMR2.0 variants by
adapting the corresponding ViTPose models. In addition, we propose leveraging
the early stages of hierarchical vision foundation models (VFMs), including
Swin Transformer, GroupMixFormer, and VMamba, as encoders. This design is
motivated by the observation that intermediate stages of hierarchical VFMs
produce feature maps with resolutions comparable to or higher than those of
non-hierarchical counterparts. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 27
hierarchical-VFM-based HMR and HPE models, demonstrating that using only the
first two or three stages achieves performance on par with full-stage models.
Moreover, we show that the resulting truncated models exhibit better trade-offs
between accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing lightweight
alternatives.

TL;DR: TerraCodec (TEC) 是一个专门为地球观测数据设计的深度学习压缩算法家族，包括图像变体和时序Transformer模型，在Sentinel-2数据上比传统编解码器实现3-10倍更强的压缩效果，并支持零样本云修复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地球观测卫星产生大量多光谱图像时间序列数据，存储和传输面临挑战。现有的图像编解码器忽略时间冗余，而视频编解码器依赖的运动先验无法捕捉静态场景的辐射演化。

Method: 提出TerraCodec系列，包括适应多光谱输入的高效图像变体，以及利用时间依赖性的时序Transformer模型(TEC-TT)。引入Latent Repacking方法训练灵活码率的transformer模型。

Result: 在Sentinel-2数据上训练，TerraCodec优于传统编解码器，在同等图像质量下实现3-10倍更强的压缩。TEC-TT在AllClear基准测试中超越现有方法实现零样本云修复。

Conclusion: 专门定制的学习压缩算法是地球观测领域的有前景方向，代码和模型权重将开源发布。

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) satellites produce massive streams of multispectral
image time series, posing pressing challenges for storage and transmission.
Yet, learned EO compression remains fragmented, lacking publicly available
pretrained models and misaligned with advances in compression for natural
imagery. Image codecs overlook temporal redundancy, while video codecs rely on
motion priors that fail to capture the radiometric evolution of largely static
scenes. We introduce TerraCodec (TEC), a family of learned codecs tailored to
EO. TEC includes efficient image-based variants adapted to multispectral
inputs, as well as a Temporal Transformer model (TEC-TT) that leverages
dependencies across time. To overcome the fixed-rate setting of today's neural
codecs, we present Latent Repacking, a novel method for training flexible-rate
transformer models that operate on varying rate-distortion settings. Trained on
Sentinel-2 data, TerraCodec outperforms classical codecs, achieving 3-10x
stronger compression at equivalent image quality. Beyond compression, TEC-TT
enables zero-shot cloud inpainting, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on the
AllClear benchmark. Our results establish bespoke, learned compression
algorithms as a promising direction for Earth observation. Code and model
weights will be released under a permissive license.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多无人机协同占用预测框架，通过空间感知特征编码和跨智能体特征集成解决BEV方法在语义几何信息捕捉和未定义/遮挡物体处理方面的局限性，显著提升精度并大幅降低通信开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前BEV方法存在两个主要限制：边界框表示无法捕捉完整场景语义和几何信息，且在遇到未定义或遮挡物体时性能显著下降。需要开发更有效的多无人机协同感知机制。

Method: 提出多无人机协同占用预测框架，包含空间感知特征编码器、跨智能体特征集成、高度感知特征缩减和双掩码感知引导机制，以紧凑表示场景信息并减少通信开销。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法达到最先进精度，显著优于现有协同方法，同时将通信开销降至先前方法的一小部分。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了BEV方法的局限性，通过占用预测更好地保留了3D空间结构和语义信息，为无人机群系统提供了高效的协同感知解决方案。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm systems necessitate efficient
collaborative perception mechanisms for diverse operational scenarios. Current
Bird's Eye View (BEV)-based approaches exhibit two main limitations:
bounding-box representations fail to capture complete semantic and geometric
information of the scene, and their performance significantly degrades when
encountering undefined or occluded objects. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel multi-UAV collaborative occupancy prediction framework. Our
framework effectively preserves 3D spatial structures and semantics through
integrating a Spatial-Aware Feature Encoder and Cross-Agent Feature
Integration. To enhance efficiency, we further introduce Altitude-Aware Feature
Reduction to compactly represent scene information, along with a Dual-Mask
Perceptual Guidance mechanism to adaptively select features and reduce
communication overhead. Due to the absence of suitable benchmark datasets, we
extend three datasets for evaluation: two virtual datasets (Air-to-Pred-Occ and
UAV3D-Occ) and one real-world dataset (GauUScene-Occ). Experiments results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly
outperforming existing collaborative methods while reducing communication
overhead to only a fraction of previous approaches.

TL;DR: 提出EReLiFM方法解决带噪声标签的开集域泛化问题，通过证据可靠性感知的残差流元学习，在有限干净数据下提升模型对未知类别的识别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，标签噪声会破坏源域知识，使模型难以识别已知类别和拒绝未知类别。现有方法在处理带噪声标签的开集域泛化时，难以弥合域间差距，特别是在干净标注数据有限的情况下。

Method: 1. 无监督两阶段证据损失聚类方法提升标签可靠性感知；2. 残差流匹配机制建模结构化的域和类别条件残差，实现多样化和不确定性感知的迁移路径；3. 元学习过程中，基于最置信预测类别生成的伪标签进行监督优化。

Conclusion: EReLiFM通过证据可靠性感知和残差流匹配机制，有效解决了带噪声标签的开集域泛化问题，在有限干净数据下实现了更好的域泛化性能。

Abstract: Open-Set Domain Generalization (OSDG) aims to enable deep learning models to
recognize unseen categories in new domains, which is crucial for real-world
applications. Label noise hinders open-set domain generalization by corrupting
source-domain knowledge, making it harder to recognize known classes and reject
unseen ones. While existing methods address OSDG under Noisy Labels (OSDG-NL)
using hyperbolic prototype-guided meta-learning, they struggle to bridge domain
gaps, especially with limited clean labeled data. In this paper, we propose
Evidential Reliability-Aware Residual Flow Meta-Learning (EReLiFM). We first
introduce an unsupervised two-stage evidential loss clustering method to
promote label reliability awareness. Then, we propose a residual flow matching
mechanism that models structured domain- and category-conditioned residuals,
enabling diverse and uncertainty-aware transfer paths beyond
interpolation-based augmentation. During this meta-learning process, the model
is optimized such that the update direction on the clean set maximizes the loss
decrease on the noisy set, using pseudo labels derived from the most confident
predicted class for supervision. Experimental results show that EReLiFM
outperforms existing methods on OSDG-NL, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在医学影像中表现优异但容易学习虚假相关性，导致偏见和泛化能力受限。人工-AI注意力对齐可缓解此问题，但依赖昂贵的监督标注。

Method: H-EGL框架包含自监督组件，利用类别区分性注意力而不依赖限制性先验，促进鲁棒性和灵活性。基于Vision Transformer在胸部X光分类任务上验证。

Result: H-EGL在胸部X光分类中优于两种最先进的解释引导学习方法，表现出更高的分类准确率和泛化能力，生成的注意力图与人类专家知识更一致。

Conclusion: H-EGL框架通过结合自监督和人工引导约束，有效提升了注意力对齐和模型泛化能力，在医学影像分析中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional
performance in medical imaging by leveraging attention mechanisms for feature
representation and interpretability. However, these models are prone to
learning spurious correlations, leading to biases and limited generalization.
While human-AI attention alignment can mitigate these issues, it often depends
on costly manual supervision. In this work, we propose a Hybrid
Explanation-Guided Learning (H-EGL) framework that combines self-supervised and
human-guided constraints to enhance attention alignment and improve
generalization. The self-supervised component of H-EGL leverages
class-distinctive attention without relying on restrictive priors, promoting
robustness and flexibility. We validate our approach on chest X-ray
classification using the Vision Transformer (ViT), where H-EGL outperforms two
state-of-the-art Explanation-Guided Learning (EGL) methods, demonstrating
superior classification accuracy and generalization capability. Additionally,
it produces attention maps that are better aligned with human expertise.

TL;DR: IRIS是一个评估多模态大语言模型在'与图像一起思考'范式下能力的基准测试，包含1,204个跨5个领域的视觉任务，显示当前模型在整合视觉和通用工具方面表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要遵循'关于图像思考'的范式，将图像视为静态输入，而忽略了MLLMs在实际应用中需要主动操作图像（如裁剪、编辑、增强）来发现关键视觉线索的需求。

Method: 引入IRIS基准测试，包含1,204个具有挑战性的开放视觉任务（603个单轮，601个多轮），涵盖5个不同领域，每个任务都配有详细的评分标准。

Result: 当前MLLMs在需要有效整合视觉和通用工具的任务上表现不佳，最强的模型GPT-5-think仅达到18.68%的通过率。不同模型表现出不同的工具使用行为。

Conclusion: IRIS作为首个专注于'与图像一起思考'范式的基准测试，为推进MLLMs的视觉智能提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in
real-world scenarios where user-provided images are often imperfect, requiring
active image manipulations such as cropping, editing, or enhancement to uncover
salient visual cues. Beyond static visual perception, MLLMs must also think
with images: dynamically transforming visual content and integrating it with
other tools to solve complex tasks. However, this shift from treating vision as
passive context to a manipulable cognitive workspace remains underexplored.
Most existing benchmarks still follow a think about images paradigm, where
images are regarded as static inputs. To address this gap, we introduce IRIS,
an Interactive Reasoning with Images and Systems that evaluates MLLMs' ability
to perceive, transform, and reason across complex visual-textual tasks under
the think with images paradigm. IRIS comprises 1,204 challenging, open-ended
vision tasks (603 single-turn, 601 multi-turn) spanning across five diverse
domains, each paired with detailed rubrics to enable systematic evaluation. Our
evaluation shows that current MLLMs struggle with tasks requiring effective
integration of vision and general-purpose tools. Even the strongest model
(GPT-5-think) reaches only 18.68% pass rate. We further observe divergent
tool-use behaviors, with OpenAI models benefiting from diverse image
manipulations while Gemini-2.5-pro shows no improvement. By introducing the
first benchmark centered on think with images, IRIS offers critical insights
for advancing visual intelligence in MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统一多模态模型存在视觉理解能力无法有效转移到视觉生成的问题，模型能正确理解图像却无法从文本提示生成忠实图像。

Method: 设计了全局-局部双奖励系统：全局奖励确保整体视觉语义和布局正确性，局部奖励优化细粒度对象级保真度，形成理解模块评估生成模块的反馈循环。

Result: 在T2I-CompBench上从82.18提升到88.37，在T2I-ReasonBench上从43.82提升到46.75，表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 建立了一个新范式，使多模态模型能够通过自奖励机制让理解模块引导和增强自身的生成能力。

Abstract: Recently, remarkable progress has been made in Unified Multimodal Models
(UMMs), which integrate vision-language generation and understanding
capabilities within a single framework. However, a significant gap exists where
a model's strong visual understanding often fails to transfer to its visual
generation. A model might correctly understand an image based on user
instructions, yet be unable to generate a faithful image from text prompts.
This phenomenon directly raises a compelling question: Can a model achieve
self-improvement by using its understanding module to reward its generation
module? To bridge this gap and achieve self-improvement, we introduce SRUM, a
self-rewarding post-training framework that can be directly applied to existing
UMMs of various designs. SRUM creates a feedback loop where the model's own
understanding module acts as an internal ``evaluator'', providing corrective
signals to improve its generation module, without requiring additional
human-labeled data. To ensure this feedback is comprehensive, we designed a
global-local dual reward system. To tackle the inherent structural complexity
of images, this system offers multi-scale guidance: a \textbf{global reward}
ensures the correctness of the overall visual semantics and layout, while a
\textbf{local reward} refines fine-grained, object-level fidelity. SRUM leads
to powerful capabilities and shows strong generalization, boosting performance
on T2I-CompBench from 82.18 to \textbf{88.37} and on T2I-ReasonBench from 43.82
to \textbf{46.75}. Overall, our work establishes a powerful new paradigm for
enabling a UMMs' understanding module to guide and enhance its own generation
via self-rewarding.

Abstract: Foundation models open up new possibilities for the use of AI in healthcare.
However, even when pre-trained on health data, they still need to be fine-tuned
for specific downstream tasks. Furthermore, although foundation models reduce
the amount of training data required to achieve good performance, obtaining
sufficient data is still a challenge. This is due, in part, to restrictions on
sharing and aggregating data from different sources to protect patients'
privacy. One possible solution to this is to fine-tune foundation models via
federated learning across multiple participating clients (i.e., hospitals,
clinics, etc.). In this work, we propose a new personalized federated
fine-tuning method that learns orthogonal LoRA adapters to disentangle general
and client-specific knowledge, enabling each client to fully exploit both their
own data and the data of others. Our preliminary results on real-world
federated medical imaging tasks demonstrate that our approach is competitive
against current federated fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced video restoration, but applying them
to real-world video super-resolution (VSR) remains challenging due to high
latency, prohibitive computation, and poor generalization to ultra-high
resolutions. Our goal in this work is to make diffusion-based VSR practical by
achieving efficiency, scalability, and real-time performance. To this end, we
propose FlashVSR, the first diffusion-based one-step streaming framework
towards real-time VSR. FlashVSR runs at approximately 17 FPS for 768x1408
videos on a single A100 GPU by combining three complementary innovations: (i) a
train-friendly three-stage distillation pipeline that enables streaming
super-resolution, (ii) locality-constrained sparse attention that cuts
redundant computation while bridging the train-test resolution gap, and (iii) a
tiny conditional decoder that accelerates reconstruction without sacrificing
quality. To support large-scale training, we also construct VSR-120K, a new
dataset with 120k videos and 180k images. Extensive experiments show that
FlashVSR scales reliably to ultra-high resolutions and achieves
state-of-the-art performance with up to 12x speedup over prior one-step
diffusion VSR models. We will release the code, pretrained models, and dataset
to foster future research in efficient diffusion-based VSR.

techniques for embodied-AI agents, while existing solutions are still prone to
segmentation deficiency, dynamic objects' interference, sensor data sparsity,
and view-limitation problems. This paper proposes a novel framework, named
SPORTS, for holistic scene understanding via tightly integrating Video Panoptic
Segmentation (VPS), Visual Odometry (VO), and Scene Rendering (SR) tasks into
an iterative and unified perspective. Firstly, VPS designs an adaptive
attention-based geometric fusion mechanism to align cross-frame features via
enrolling the pose, depth, and optical flow modality, which automatically
adjust feature maps for different decoding stages. And a post-matching strategy
is integrated to improve identities tracking. In VO, panoptic segmentation
results from VPS are combined with the optical flow map to improve the
confidence estimation of dynamic objects, which enhances the accuracy of the
camera pose estimation and completeness of the depth map generation via the
learning-based paradigm. Furthermore, the point-based rendering of SR is
beneficial from VO, transforming sparse point clouds into neural fields to
synthesize high-fidelity RGB views and twin panoptic views. Extensive
experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our attention-based
feature fusion outperforms most existing state-of-the-art methods on the
odometry, tracking, segmentation, and novel view synthesis tasks.

*A. Alfarano,L. Venturoli,D. Negueruela del Castillo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了VQArt-Bench，一个用于文化遗产领域的大规模视觉问答基准，通过多智能体流水线生成多样化问题，评估多模态大语言模型在视觉艺术分析中的深度语义理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉问答基准在评估深度语义理解方面存在不足，特别是在视觉艺术分析等复杂领域，问题局限于简单句法结构和表面属性，导致模型利用统计捷径而非进行视觉推理。

Method: 采用新颖的多智能体流水线，让专门化的智能体协作生成经过验证的、语言多样化的细致问题，基准结构围绕相关视觉理解维度设计。

Result: 对14个最先进的多模态大语言模型进行评估，发现当前模型存在显著局限性，包括在简单计数任务中的意外弱点，以及专有模型与开源模型之间的明显性能差距。

Conclusion: VQArt-Bench基准揭示了当前多模态大语言模型在深度视觉语义理解方面的不足，特别是在复杂视觉关系、象征意义和叙事理解等维度上表现不佳。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
capabilities in joint visual and linguistic tasks. However, existing Visual
Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks often fail to evaluate deep semantic
understanding, particularly in complex domains like visual art analysis.
Confined to simple syntactic structures and surface-level attributes, these
questions fail to capture the diversity and depth of human visual inquiry. This
limitation incentivizes models to exploit statistical shortcuts rather than
engage in visual reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce VQArt-Bench, a
new, large-scale VQA benchmark for the cultural heritage domain. This benchmark
is constructed using a novel multi-agent pipeline where specialized agents
collaborate to generate nuanced, validated, and linguistically diverse
questions. The resulting benchmark is structured along relevant visual
understanding dimensions that probe a model's ability to interpret symbolic
meaning, narratives, and complex visual relationships. Our evaluation of 14
state-of-the-art MLLMs on this benchmark reveals significant limitations in
current models, including a surprising weakness in simple counting tasks and a
clear performance gap between proprietary and open-source models.

*Wenpu Li,Bangyan Liao,Yi Zhou,Qi Xu,Pian Wan,Peidong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出E-MoFlow框架，通过隐式时空和几何正则化联合优化自运动和光流估计，无需监督即可在6-DoF运动场景中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将光流和6-DoF自运动估计分开处理，在神经形态视觉中由于缺乏鲁棒的数据关联而成为不适定问题。现有方法要么引入偏差和计算开销，要么容易陷入局部最优。

Method: 将相机自运动建模为连续样条，光流建模为隐式神经表示，通过归纳偏置嵌入时空一致性，并通过微分几何约束结合结构和运动先验，避免显式深度估计。

Result: 在6-DoF运动场景中表现出色，在无监督方法中达到最先进性能，甚至与有监督方法竞争。

Conclusion: E-MoFlow框架通过隐式正则化统一了自运动和光流估计，在无监督范式下实现了优异的性能和通用性。

Abstract: The estimation of optical flow and 6-DoF ego-motion, two fundamental tasks in
3D vision, has typically been addressed independently. For neuromorphic vision
(e.g., event cameras), however, the lack of robust data association makes
solving the two problems separately an ill-posed challenge, especially in the
absence of supervision via ground truth. Existing works mitigate this
ill-posedness by either enforcing the smoothness of the flow field via an
explicit variational regularizer or leveraging explicit structure-and-motion
priors in the parametrization to improve event alignment. The former notably
introduces bias in results and computational overhead, while the latter, which
parametrizes the optical flow in terms of the scene depth and the camera
motion, often converges to suboptimal local minima. To address these issues, we
propose an unsupervised framework that jointly optimizes egomotion and optical
flow via implicit spatial-temporal and geometric regularization. First, by
modeling camera's egomotion as a continuous spline and optical flow as an
implicit neural representation, our method inherently embeds spatial-temporal
coherence through inductive biases. Second, we incorporate structure-and-motion
priors through differential geometric constraints, bypassing explicit depth
estimation while maintaining rigorous geometric consistency. As a result, our
framework (called E-MoFlow) unifies egomotion and optical flow estimation via
implicit regularization under a fully unsupervised paradigm. Experiments
demonstrate its versatility to general 6-DoF motion scenarios, achieving
state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods and competitive even
with supervised approaches.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的头部运动校正方法DL-HMC++，通过交叉注意力机制从1秒3D PET原始数据预测刚性头部运动，无需硬件运动追踪设备，在多种PET扫描仪和放射性示踪剂上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 头部运动是脑PET成像中的主要挑战，会导致图像伪影和示踪剂定量不准确。硬件运动追踪在临床实践中应用有限，需要开发数据驱动的运动校正方法。

Method: 使用深度学习结合交叉注意力机制，从1秒3D PET原始数据预测刚性头部运动。利用现有动态PET扫描和外部硬件运动追踪的金标准数据进行监督训练。

Result: 在HRRT和mCT两种PET扫描仪及四种放射性示踪剂上验证，DL-HMC++优于现有数据驱动方法，产生的无运动图像与金标准硬件追踪结果难以区分。HRRT和mCT的平均差异比分别为1.2±0.5%和0.5±0.2%。

Conclusion: DL-HMC++展示了数据驱动PET头部运动校正的潜力，可消除硬件追踪负担，使运动校正技术能够应用于研究环境之外的临床人群。

Abstract: Head movement poses a significant challenge in brain positron emission
tomography (PET) imaging, resulting in image artifacts and tracer uptake
quantification inaccuracies. Effective head motion estimation and correction
are crucial for precise quantitative image analysis and accurate diagnosis of
neurological disorders. Hardware-based motion tracking (HMT) has limited
applicability in real-world clinical practice. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a deep-learning head motion correction approach with cross-attention
(DL-HMC++) to predict rigid head motion from one-second 3D PET raw data.
DL-HMC++ is trained in a supervised manner by leveraging existing dynamic PET
scans with gold-standard motion measurements from external HMT. We evaluate
DL-HMC++ on two PET scanners (HRRT and mCT) and four radiotracers (18F-FDG,
18F-FPEB, 11C-UCB-J, and 11C-LSN3172176) to demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization of the approach in large cohort PET studies. Quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that DL-HMC++ consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art data-driven motion estimation methods, producing motion-free
images with clear delineation of brain structures and reduced motion artifacts
that are indistinguishable from gold-standard HMT. Brain region of interest
standard uptake value analysis exhibits average difference ratios between
DL-HMC++ and gold-standard HMT to be 1.2 plus-minus 0.5% for HRRT and 0.5
plus-minus 0.2% for mCT. DL-HMC++ demonstrates the potential for data-driven
PET head motion correction to remove the burden of HMT, making motion
correction accessible to clinical populations beyond research settings. The

Method: 提出了一种推理时特征无关的上采样架构，无需编码器特定训练，能够泛化到不同特征类型。

Result: AnyUp在特征上采样方面达到了新的最先进水平，能够泛化到不同特征类型，保持特征语义，同时高效且易于应用于广泛的下游任务。

Conclusion: AnyUp提供了一种通用、高效的特征上采样解决方案，克服了现有方法的局限性，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: We introduce AnyUp, a method for feature upsampling that can be applied to
any vision feature at any resolution, without encoder-specific training.
Existing learning-based upsamplers for features like DINO or CLIP need to be
re-trained for every feature extractor and thus do not generalize to different
feature types at inference time. In this work, we propose an inference-time
feature-agnostic upsampling architecture to alleviate this limitation and
improve upsampling quality. In our experiments, AnyUp sets a new state of the
art for upsampled features, generalizes to different feature types, and
preserves feature semantics while being efficient and easy to apply to a wide
range of downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然面向PSNR的高效超分辨率取得了显著进展，但专注于感知质量指标的方法仍然相对低效。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 在不超过5M参数和2000 GFLOPs的效率约束下开发解决方案，并在包含500张4K测试图像的新数据集上进行评估，这些图像使用多种退化类型进行退化处理。

Result: 表现最佳的方法在所有基准数据集上都超越了Real-ESRGAN，证明了高效方法在感知领域的潜力。

Conclusion: 本文为高效感知超分辨率建立了现代基准。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study and benchmark on Efficient
Perceptual Super-Resolution (EPSR). While significant progress has been made in
efficient PSNR-oriented super resolution, approaches focusing on perceptual
quality metrics remain relatively inefficient. Motivated by this gap, we aim to
replicate or improve the perceptual results of Real-ESRGAN while meeting strict
efficiency constraints: a maximum of 5M parameters and 2000 GFLOPs, calculated
for an input size of 960x540 pixels. The proposed solutions were evaluated on a
novel dataset consisting of 500 test images of 4K resolution, each degraded
using multiple degradation types, without providing the original high-quality
counterparts. This design aims to reflect realistic deployment conditions and
serves as a diverse and challenging benchmark. The top-performing approach
manages to outperform Real-ESRGAN across all benchmark datasets, demonstrating
the potential of efficient methods in the perceptual domain. This paper
establishes the modern baselines for efficient perceptual super resolution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: USplat4D是一个不确定性感知的动态高斯泼溅框架，通过建模每个高斯原语的时间变化不确定性，构建时空图进行不确定性感知优化，提升4D重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动态高斯泼溅模型对所有高斯原语进行统一优化，忽略了它们在视图和时间上的可见性差异，导致遮挡下的运动漂移和极端视角下的合成质量下降。

Method: 提出估计每个高斯原语的时间变化不确定性，并利用这些不确定性构建时空图，通过不确定性感知优化传播可靠的运动线索。

Result: 在多个真实和合成数据集上的实验表明，显式建模不确定性能够持续改进动态高斯泼溅模型，在遮挡下产生更稳定的几何结构，并在极端视角下实现高质量的合成。

Conclusion: 不确定性感知对于动态高斯泼溅模型至关重要，能够有效提升4D重建的稳定性和质量。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular input is fundamentally
under-constrained, with ambiguities arising from occlusion and extreme novel
views. While dynamic Gaussian Splatting offers an efficient representation,
vanilla models optimize all Gaussian primitives uniformly, ignoring whether
they are well or poorly observed. This limitation leads to motion drifts under
occlusion and degraded synthesis when extrapolating to unseen views. We argue
that uncertainty matters: Gaussians with recurring observations across views
and time act as reliable anchors to guide motion, whereas those with limited
visibility are treated as less reliable. To this end, we introduce USplat4D, a
novel Uncertainty-aware dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework that propagates
reliable motion cues to enhance 4D reconstruction. Our key insight is to
estimate time-varying per-Gaussian uncertainty and leverages it to construct a
spatio-temporal graph for uncertainty-aware optimization. Experiments on
diverse real and synthetic datasets show that explicitly modeling uncertainty
consistently improves dynamic Gaussian Splatting models, yielding more stable
geometry under occlusion and high-quality synthesis at extreme viewpoints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通常只能密集采样单一场景动态实现，需要更灵活的方式来理解物理场景中基于局部交互的多样化变化方式

Method: 使用Flow Poke Transformer框架，基于稀疏交互条件直接预测局部运动分布，提供可解释的多模态运动表示

Result: 在密集面部运动生成任务中，通用预训练模型超越专用基线；在强分布外任务中微调后，在关节物体运动估计上显著优于域内方法；在移动部件分割等任务上达到竞争性能

Conclusion: FPT框架能够直接预测显式运动分布，在多个下游任务中表现出色，证明了该方法的灵活性和多功能性

Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of a physical scene involves reasoning about the
diverse ways it can potentially change, especially as a result of local
interactions. We present the Flow Poke Transformer (FPT), a novel framework for
directly predicting the distribution of local motion, conditioned on sparse
interactions termed "pokes". Unlike traditional methods that typically only
enable dense sampling of a single realization of scene dynamics, FPT provides
an interpretable directly accessible representation of multi-modal scene
motion, its dependency on physical interactions and the inherent uncertainties
of scene dynamics. We also evaluate our model on several downstream tasks to
enable comparisons with prior methods and highlight the flexibility of our
approach. On dense face motion generation, our generic pre-trained model
surpasses specialized baselines. FPT can be fine-tuned in strongly
out-of-distribution tasks such as synthetic datasets to enable significant
improvements over in-domain methods in articulated object motion estimation.
Additionally, predicting explicit motion distributions directly enables our
method to achieve competitive performance on tasks like moving part
segmentation from pokes which further demonstrates the versatility of our FPT.

Motivation: 传统创建逼真数字人化身的过程昂贵耗时，需要复杂的相机捕捉设备和专业艺术家。现有单图像方法虽然降低了门槛，但缺乏多视角约束，导致视角偏离时质量下降。

Method: 基于预训练的视频扩散模型，从单张参考图像生成包含数百帧的多视角视频，视角变化可达360度，并将输出提炼为可实时渲染的4D化身。

Conclusion: MVP4D通过多视角视频生成和4D化身提炼，有效解决了单图像方法在视角变化时的质量问题，为数字人化身创建提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Digital human avatars aim to simulate the dynamic appearance of humans in
virtual environments, enabling immersive experiences across gaming, film,
virtual reality, and more. However, the conventional process for creating and
animating photorealistic human avatars is expensive and time-consuming,
requiring large camera capture rigs and significant manual effort from
professional 3D artists. With the advent of capable image and video generation
models, recent methods enable automatic rendering of realistic animated avatars
from a single casually captured reference image of a target subject. While
these techniques significantly lower barriers to avatar creation and offer
compelling realism, they lack constraints provided by multi-view information or
an explicit 3D representation. So, image quality and realism degrade when
rendered from viewpoints that deviate strongly from the reference image. Here,
we build a video model that generates animatable multi-view videos of digital
humans based on a single reference image and target expressions. Our model,
MVP4D, is based on a state-of-the-art pre-trained video diffusion model and
generates hundreds of frames simultaneously from viewpoints varying by up to
360 degrees around a target subject. We show how to distill the outputs of this
model into a 4D avatar that can be rendered in real-time. Our approach
significantly improves the realism, temporal consistency, and 3D consistency of
generated avatars compared to previous methods.

Motivation: 现有视觉生成架构通常使用独立的图像和文本编码器，限制了跨模态推理和知识迁移能力。之前的统一模型方法需要大量计算资源和数据，可访问性有限。

Method: 使用冻结的VLM作为统一编码器，提出Layerwise Attention Pooling机制提取多层级信息，并开发VERIFI方法进行模型内提示重写，仅使用VLM生成的文本token来条件化扩散变换器。

Result: LAP在文本-图像对齐方面优于其他浅层融合架构，能够忠实传递视觉信息。在编辑任务上微调不仅提高了生成对齐度，还展现出强大的泛化能力，能够零样本适应多图像参考。

Conclusion: UniFusion的统一编码器设计证明了跨模态知识迁移的有效性，通过冻结VLM和创新的融合机制，实现了高效的多模态生成和编辑能力。

Abstract: Although recent advances in visual generation have been remarkable, most
existing architectures still depend on distinct encoders for images and text.
This separation constrains diffusion models' ability to perform cross-modal
reasoning and knowledge transfer. Prior attempts to bridge this gap often use
the last layer information from VLM, employ multiple visual encoders, or train
large unified models jointly for text and image generation, which demands
substantial computational resources and large-scale data, limiting its
accessibility.We present UniFusion, a diffusion-based generative model
conditioned on a frozen large vision-language model (VLM) that serves as a
unified multimodal encoder. At the core of UniFusion is the Layerwise Attention
Pooling (LAP) mechanism that extracts both high level semantics and low level
details from text and visual tokens of a frozen VLM to condition a diffusion
generative model. We demonstrate that LAP outperforms other shallow fusion
architectures on text-image alignment for generation and faithful transfer of
visual information from VLM to the diffusion model which is key for editing. We
propose VLM-Enabled Rewriting Injection with Flexibile Inference (VERIFI),
which conditions a diffusion transformer (DiT) only on the text tokens
generated by the VLM during in-model prompt rewriting. VERIFI combines the
alignment of the conditioning distribution with the VLM's reasoning
capabilities for increased capabilities and flexibility at inference. In
addition, finetuning on editing task not only improves text-image alignment for
generation, indicative of cross-modality knowledge transfer, but also exhibits
tremendous generalization capabilities. Our model when trained on single image
editing, zero-shot generalizes to multiple image references further motivating
the unified encoder design of UniFusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs因图像输入引入额外视觉token导致推理成本增加，需要更高效的方法

Method: 使用多个不同压缩比的MLP连接器下采样视觉token，训练时最小化不同连接器响应的KL散度，推理时通过ViR路由器自动选择压缩率

Result: 实验显示可减少多达50%的视觉token，同时保持模型的感知、推理和OCR能力

Conclusion: 该方法有助于开发更高效的MLLMs，代码和模型将开源

Abstract: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from increased
inference costs due to the additional vision tokens introduced by image inputs.
In this work, we propose Visual Consistency Learning (ViCO), a novel training
algorithm that enables the model to represent images of varying semantic
complexities using different numbers of vision tokens. The key idea behind our
method is to employ multiple MLP connectors, each with a different image
compression ratio, to downsample the vision tokens based on the semantic
complexity of the image. During training, we minimize the KL divergence between
the responses conditioned on different MLP connectors. At inference time, we
introduce an image router, termed Visual Resolution Router (ViR), that
automatically selects the appropriate compression rate for each image patch.
Compared with existing dynamic high-resolution strategies, which adjust the
number of visual tokens based on image resolutions, our method dynamically
adapts the number of visual tokens according to semantic complexity.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the number of
vision tokens by up to 50% while maintaining the model's perception, reasoning,
and OCR capabilities. We hope this work will contribute to the development of
more efficient MLLMs. The code and models will be released to facilitate future
research.

Motivation: CMP为图像拓扑分析提供了强大工具，但由于多过滤结构的复杂性和CMP向量化的困难，其应用受到限制。需要一种方法将CMP的全局结构信息整合到深度网络中。

Method: 提出新算法向量化立方复形的多参数同调，将CMP分解为可学习的单参数持久性组合，联合学习双过滤函数，确保可微分性以集成到Swin Transformer等先进架构中。

Conclusion: CuMPerLay为将全局结构信息整合到深度网络中提供了有前景的方向，特别适用于结构化图像分析任务。

Abstract: We present CuMPerLay, a novel differentiable vectorization layer that enables
the integration of Cubical Multiparameter Persistence (CMP) into deep learning
pipelines. While CMP presents a natural and powerful way to topologically work
with images, its use is hindered by the complexity of multifiltration
structures as well as the vectorization of CMP. In face of these challenges, we
introduce a new algorithm for vectorizing MP homologies of cubical complexes.
Our CuMPerLay decomposes the CMP into a combination of individual, learnable
single-parameter persistence, where the bifiltration functions are jointly
learned. Thanks to the differentiability, its robust topological feature
vectors can be seamlessly used within state-of-the-art architectures such as
Swin Transformers. We establish theoretical guarantees for the stability of our
vectorization under generalized Wasserstein metrics. Our experiments on
benchmark medical imaging and computer vision datasets show the benefit
CuMPerLay on classification and segmentation performance, particularly in
limited-data scenarios. Overall, CuMPerLay offers a promising direction for
integrating global structural information into deep networks for structured
image analysis.

Conclusion: 世界建模通过提供密集自监督信号有效解决了VLA模型的监督赤字问题，显著提升了驾驶智能性能，且具有良好的数据缩放特性。

Abstract: Scaling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models on large-scale data offers a
promising path to achieving a more generalized driving intelligence. However,
VLA models are limited by a ``supervision deficit'': the vast model capacity is
supervised by sparse, low-dimensional actions, leaving much of their
representational power underutilized. To remedy this, we propose
\textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to
predict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that
compels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment.
We showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA
archetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual
tokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual
features. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we
introduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for
real-time deployment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and a
680x larger in-house dataset demonstrate that DriveVLA-W0 significantly
outperforms BEV and VLA baselines. Crucially, it amplifies the data scaling
law, showing that performance gains accelerate as the training dataset size
increases.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于MLLM的目标检测方法面临的低召回率、重复预测、坐标不对齐等问题，弥合传统回归模型与MLLM方法之间的性能差距。

Method: 1) 使用特殊token表示量化坐标；2) 构建多个数据引擎生成高质量数据；3) 采用两阶段训练流程：在2200万数据上进行监督微调，然后基于GRPO的强化学习后训练。

Result: 在COCO和LVIS等基准测试中，零样本性能达到或超过DINO、Grounding DINO等回归模型，并具备对象指代、指向、视觉提示、GUI定位、空间指代、OCR和关键点定位等多种能力。

Conclusion: Rex-Omni为更通用和语言感知的视觉感知系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Object detection has long been dominated by traditional coordinate
regression-based models, such as YOLO, DETR, and Grounding DINO. Although
recent efforts have attempted to leverage MLLMs to tackle this task, they face
challenges like low recall rate, duplicate predictions, coordinate
misalignment, etc. In this work, we bridge this gap and propose Rex-Omni, a
3B-scale MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art object perception performance. On
benchmarks like COCO and LVIS, Rex-Omni attains performance comparable to or
exceeding regression-based models (e.g., DINO, Grounding DINO) in a zero-shot
setting. This is enabled by three key designs: 1) Task Formulation: we use
special tokens to represent quantized coordinates from 0 to 999, reducing the
model's learning difficulty and improving token efficiency for coordinate
prediction; 2) Data Engines: we construct multiple data engines to generate
high-quality grounding, referring, and pointing data, providing semantically
rich supervision for training; \3) Training Pipelines: we employ a two-stage
training process, combining supervised fine-tuning on 22 million data with
GRPO-based reinforcement post-training. This RL post-training leverages
geometry-aware rewards to effectively bridge the discrete-to-continuous
coordinate prediction gap, improve box accuracy, and mitigate undesirable
behaviors like duplicate predictions that stem from the teacher-guided nature
of the initial SFT stage. Beyond conventional detection, Rex-Omni's inherent
language understanding enables versatile capabilities such as object referring,
pointing, visual prompting, GUI grounding, spatial referring, OCR and
key-pointing, all systematically evaluated on dedicated benchmarks. We believe
that Rex-Omni paves the way for more versatile and language-aware visual
perception systems.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world applications require
access to external knowledge sources and must remain responsive to the dynamic
and ever-changing real-world information in order to address
information-seeking and knowledge-intensive user queries. Existing approaches,
such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods, search agents, and search
equipped MLLMs, often suffer from rigid pipelines, excessive search calls, and
poorly constructed search queries, which result in inefficiencies and
suboptimal outcomes. To address these limitations, we present DeepMMSearch-R1,
the first multimodal LLM capable of performing on-demand, multi-turn web
searches and dynamically crafting queries for both image and text search tools.
Specifically, DeepMMSearch-R1 can initiate web searches based on relevant crops
of the input image making the image search more effective, and can iteratively
adapt text search queries based on retrieved information, thereby enabling
self-reflection and self-correction. Our approach relies on a two-stage
training pipeline: a cold start supervised finetuning phase followed by an
online reinforcement learning optimization. For training, we introduce
DeepMMSearchVQA, a novel multimodal VQA dataset created through an automated
pipeline intermixed with real-world information from web search tools. This
dataset contains diverse, multi-hop queries that integrate textual and visual
information, teaching the model when to search, what to search for, which
search tool to use and how to reason over the retrieved information. We conduct
extensive experiments across a range of knowledge-intensive benchmarks to
demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Finally, we analyze the results
and provide insights that are valuable for advancing multimodal web-search.
