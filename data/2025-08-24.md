*Jianfeng Si,Lin Sun,Zhewen Tan,Xiangzheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过单一SFT阶段的统一共训练框架，使大语言模型能够通过系统指令动态切换三种安全行为模式，在保持安全性的同时大幅降低训练咋部署成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前LLM内容安全方法依赖多阶段训练流水线、缺乏细粒度控制能力的问题，提供更灵活的部署选择

Method: 采用统一共训练框架，在单一SFT阶段集成三种安全行为：正向（合规/社会良好）、负向（无过滤/风险倾向）咋拒绝向（保守/拒绝导向），通过系统指令动态激活

Result: 8B模型在安全性能力上超过DeepSeek-R1(671B)，达到SFT+DPO的安全对齐质量，同时显著降低训练复杂度咋部署成本

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可扩展、高效且高度可控的LLM内容安全解决方案，具有明显的实践价值

Abstract: Current methods for content safety in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF), often rely on multi-stage training pipelines and lack fine-grained,
post-deployment controllability. To address these limitations, we propose a
unified co-training framework that efficiently integrates multiple safety
behaviors: positive (lawful/prosocial), negative (unfiltered/risk-prone) and
rejective (refusal-oriented/conservative) within a single SFT stage. Notably,
each behavior is dynamically activated via a simple system-level instruction,
or magic token, enabling stealthy and efficient behavioral switching at
inference time. This flexibility supports diverse deployment scenarios, such as
positive for safe user interaction, negative for internal red-teaming, and
rejective for context-aware refusals triggered by upstream moderation signals.
This co-training strategy induces a distinct Safety Alignment Margin in the
output space, characterized by well-separated response distributions
corresponding to each safety mode. The existence of this margin provides
empirical evidence for the model's safety robustness and enables unprecedented
fine-grained control. Experiments show that our method matches the safety
alignment quality of SFT+DPO, with our 8B model notably surpassing DeepSeek-R1
(671B) in safety performance, while significantly reducing both training
complexity and deployment costs. This work presents a scalable, efficient, and
highly controllable solution for LLM content safety.

TL;DR: WMT25机器翻译共享任务的初步自动评估排名报告，强调自动排名可能存在偏差，最终官方排名将基于更可靠的人工评估


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 向任务参与者分享初步结果，帮助他们在准备系统提交论文时参考，同时说明自动评估的局限性

Method: 使用自动指标对机器翻译系统进行评估和排名

Result: 生成了基于自动指标的初步排名，但指出该排名可能偏向使用重排序技术的系统

Conclusion: 这是初步结果而非最终发现，官方WMT25排名将基于更可靠的人工评估并取代自动排名

Abstract: We present the preliminary ranking of the WMT25 General Machine Translation
Shared Task, in which MT systems have been evaluated using automatic metrics.
As this ranking is based on automatic evaluations, it may be biased in favor of
systems that employ re-ranking techniques, such as Quality Estimation
re-ranking or Minimum Bayes Risk decoding. The official WMT25 ranking will be
based on human evaluation, which is more reliable and will supersede the
automatic ranking.
  The purpose of this report is not to present the final findings of the
General MT task, but rather to share preliminary results with task
participants, which may be useful when preparing their system submission
papers.

### [3] [Bridging the Culture Gap: A Framework for LLM-Driven Socio-Cultural Localization of Math Word Problems in Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14913)
*Israel Abebe Azime,Tadesse Destaw Belay,Dietrich Klakow,Philipp Slusallek,Anshuman Chhabra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于大语言模型的文化本土化框架，用于自动生成包含本土实体的多语言数学应用题数据集，以改善低资源语言的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多语言数学评测集主要通过翻译生成，保留了英语中心的实体，导致低资源语言的文化本土化数学推理能力落后。需要解决本土化数据集稀缺的问题。

Method: 设计了一种LLM驱动的文化本土化框架，能够自动从现有数据源构建包含本土名字、组织和货币等实体的数据集。

Result: 实验结果显示，翻译的评测集可能隐藏了真实的多语言数学能力。该框架能够减少英语中心实体偏差，提高各种语言中本土实体的稳健性。

Conclusion: 该研究为多语言文化本土化数学推理提供了有效解决方案，帮助缓解低资源语言在适当社会文化背景下的数学能力问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in
solving mathematical problems expressed in natural language. However,
multilingual and culturally-grounded mathematical reasoning in low-resource
languages lags behind English due to the scarcity of socio-cultural task
datasets that reflect accurate native entities such as person names,
organization names, and currencies. Existing multilingual benchmarks are
predominantly produced via translation and typically retain English-centric
entities, owing to the high cost associated with human annotater-based
localization. Moreover, automated localization tools are limited, and hence,
truly localized datasets remain scarce. To bridge this gap, we introduce a
framework for LLM-driven cultural localization of math word problems that
automatically constructs datasets with native names, organizations, and
currencies from existing sources. We find that translated benchmarks can
obscure true multilingual math ability under appropriate socio-cultural
contexts. Through extensive experiments, we also show that our framework can
help mitigate English-centric entity bias and improves robustness when native
entities are introduced across various languages.

### [4] [Improving LLMs for Machine Translation Using Synthetic Preference Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14951)
*Dario Vajda,Domen Vreš,Marko Robnik-Šikonja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过直接偏好优化(DPO)技术，使用程序化筛选的语料对比数据对马耳兰语进行精细调整，提升了GaMS-9B-Instruct模型的机器翻译性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何用较少的易产生数据资源来改善通用指令调整大语言模型的机器翻译能力

Method: 使用直接偏好优化(DPO)训练，通过程序化筛选公开数据集子集生成质量排名的翻译对比数据，使用COMET等自动评估指标进行排名

Result: 细调后的模型在翻译维基百科文章时超过了数据集生成中的两个基线模型，COMET得分分别提升0.04和0.02，更一致避免语言和格式错误

Conclusion: 通过少量高质量数据的DPO训练可以有效提升通用大语言模型的翻译性能，特别是在语言和格式准确性方面

Abstract: Large language models have emerged as effective machine translation systems.
In this paper, we explore how a general instruction-tuned large language model
can be improved for machine translation using relatively few easily produced
data resources. Using Slovene as a use case, we improve the GaMS-9B-Instruct
model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training on a programmatically
curated and enhanced subset of a public dataset. As DPO requires pairs of
quality-ranked instances, we generated its training dataset by translating
English Wikipedia articles using two LLMs, GaMS-9B-Instruct and
EuroLLM-9B-Instruct. We ranked the resulting translations based on heuristics
coupled with automatic evaluation metrics such as COMET. The evaluation shows
that our fine-tuned model outperforms both models involved in the dataset
generation. In comparison to the baseline models, the fine-tuned model achieved
a COMET score gain of around 0.04 and 0.02, respectively, on translating
Wikipedia articles. It also more consistently avoids language and formatting
errors.

### [5] [Multilingual Datasets for Custom Input Extraction and Explanation Requests Parsing in Conversational XAI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14982)
*Qianli Wang,Tatiana Anikina,Nils Feldhus,Simon Ostermann,Fedor Splitt,Jiaao Li,Yoana Tsoneva,Sebastian Möller,Vera Schmitt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了MultiCoXQL多语言数据集和Compass自定义输入数据集，用于改进多语言对话式可解释AI系统的意图识别和解析性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的对话式可解释AI系统在英语方面表现良好，但面临多语言训练数据稀缺和自定义输入支持有限的挑战。

Method: 首先扩展了CoXQL数据集为MultiCoXQL覆盖5种语言，提出新的解析方法；然后创建Compass数据集用于自定义输入提取，并在多语言、跨语言和单语言设置下评估多种LLM和BERT模型。

Result: 论文评估了三种不同规模的LLM在MultiCoXQL上的解析性能，以及在Compass数据集上的意图识别效果，为多语言ConvXAI系统提供了基准。

Conclusion: 该研究为解决ConvXAI系统的多语言泛化问题和自定义输入支持提供了重要数据集和方法，推动了对话式可解释AI在多语言环境中的发展。

Abstract: Conversational explainable artificial intelligence (ConvXAI) systems based on
large language models (LLMs) have garnered considerable attention for their
ability to enhance user comprehension through dialogue-based explanations.
Current ConvXAI systems often are based on intent recognition to accurately
identify the user's desired intention and map it to an explainability method.
While such methods offer great precision and reliability in discerning users'
underlying intentions for English, a significant challenge in the scarcity of
training data persists, which impedes multilingual generalization. Besides, the
support for free-form custom inputs, which are user-defined data distinct from
pre-configured dataset instances, remains largely limited. To bridge these
gaps, we first introduce MultiCoXQL, a multilingual extension of the CoXQL
dataset spanning five typologically diverse languages, including one
low-resource language. Subsequently, we propose a new parsing approach aimed at
enhancing multilingual parsing performance, and evaluate three LLMs on
MultiCoXQL using various parsing strategies. Furthermore, we present Compass, a
new multilingual dataset designed for custom input extraction in ConvXAI
systems, encompassing 11 intents across the same five languages as MultiCoXQL.
We conduct monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual evaluations on Compass,
employing three LLMs of varying sizes alongside BERT-type models.

### [6] [Reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling Is An Efficient Test-Time Weak-to-Strong Aligner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15044)
*Bolian Li,Yanran Wu,Xinyu Luo,Ruqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出奖励偏移推测采样算法(SSS)，通过在推理时使用对齐的小型草稿模型来高效实现测试时对齐，显著降低推理成本的同时保持性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时对齐技术虽然能提升LLM的安全性和推理能力，但往往带来巨大的推理成本，限制了实际应用。受推测采样加速技术的启发，希望解决测试时对齐的效率瓶颈问题

Method: SSS算法：让小型草稿模型与人类偏好对齐，而目标模型保持不变。通过修改接受标准和奖励令牌分布，利用对齐草稿模型与未对齐目标模型之间的分布偏移来恢复RLHF最优解

Result: 在测试时弱到强对齐实验中，算法以显著降低的推理成本获得了优越的黄金奖励分数

Conclusion: SSS算法既有效又高效，成功解决了测试时对齐的高成本问题，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has become a
critical step in their development. Recent research has increasingly focused on
test-time alignment, where additional compute is allocated during inference to
enhance LLM safety and reasoning capabilities. However, these test-time
alignment techniques often incur substantial inference costs, limiting their
practical application. We are inspired by the speculative sampling
acceleration, which leverages a small draft model to efficiently predict future
tokens, to address the efficiency bottleneck of test-time alignment. We
introduce the reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling (SSS) algorithm, in which the
draft model is aligned with human preferences, while the target model remains
unchanged. We theoretically demonstrate that the distributional shift between
the aligned draft model and the unaligned target model can be exploited to
recover the RLHF optimal solution without actually obtaining it, by modifying
the acceptance criterion and bonus token distribution. Our algorithm achieves
superior gold reward scores at a significantly reduced inference cost in
test-time weak-to-strong alignment experiments, thereby validating both its
effectiveness and efficiency.

### [7] [LongRecall: A Structured Approach for Robust Recall Evaluation in Long-Form Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15085)
*MohamamdJavad Ardestani,Ehsan Kamalloo,Davood Rafiei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongRecall是一个三阶段召回评估框架，通过分解答案、多级过滤和结构化对齐检查来提升机器生成文本的完整性评估准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有召回指标依赖词汇重叠导致错误，而LLM评估方法存在对齐问题和幻觉，在医疗、法律等关键领域需要更可靠的完整性评估

Method: 三阶段框架：1)将答案分解为自包含事实 2)通过词汇和语义过滤逐步缩小候选匹配 3)结构化蕴含检查验证对齐

Result: 在三个长形式QA基准测试中，相比强基线方法在召回准确性上有显著提升

Conclusion: LongRecall为系统性召回评估提供了基础构建块，能减少假阳性和假阴性，适应多样化表达和上下文变化

Abstract: LongRecall. The completeness of machine-generated text, ensuring that it
captures all relevant information, is crucial in domains such as medicine and
law and in tasks like list-based question answering (QA), where omissions can
have serious consequences. However, existing recall metrics often depend on
lexical overlap, leading to errors with unsubstantiated entities and
paraphrased answers, while LLM-as-a-Judge methods with long holistic prompts
capture broader semantics but remain prone to misalignment and hallucinations
without structured verification. We introduce LongRecall, a general three-stage
recall evaluation framework that decomposes answers into self-contained facts,
successively narrows plausible candidate matches through lexical and semantic
filtering, and verifies their alignment through structured entailment checks.
This design reduces false positives and false negatives while accommodating
diverse phrasings and contextual variations, serving as a foundational building
block for systematic recall assessment. We evaluate LongRecall on three
challenging long-form QA benchmarks using both human annotations and LLM-based
judges, demonstrating substantial improvements in recall accuracy over strong
lexical and LLM-as-a-Judge baselines.

### [8] [Mapping the Course for Prompt-based Structured Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15090)
*Matt Pauk,Maria Leonor Pacheco*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出将大语言模型（LLMs）与组合推理相结合，以解决LLMs在结构化预测任务中的幻觉和复杂推理问题，通过符号推理提升预测的一致性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然在各种语言任务中表现出色，但由于其自回归特性，经常出现幻觉和复杂推理困难的问题，特别是在结构化预测任务中。

Method: 结合LLMs与组合推理方法，通过不同的提示策略估计LLM的置信度值，并利用符号推理确保结构一致性，同时使用结构化预测目标进行校准和微调。

Result: 实验表明，无论采用何种提示策略，在提示基础上添加符号推理都能带来更一致和准确的预测，且使用结构化学习目标进行校准和微调能提升挑战性任务的性能。

Conclusion: 在LLMs时代，结构化学习仍然具有重要价值，通过结合符号推理可以显著提升模型的预测质量和一致性。

Abstract: LLMs have been shown to be useful for a variety of language tasks, without
requiring task-specific fine-tuning. However, these models often struggle with
hallucinations and complex reasoning problems due to their autoregressive
nature. We propose to address some of these issues, specifically in the area of
structured prediction, by combining LLMs with combinatorial inference in an
attempt to marry the predictive power of LLMs with the structural consistency
provided by inference methods. We perform exhaustive experiments in an effort
to understand which prompting strategies can effectively estimate LLM
confidence values for use with symbolic inference, and show that, regardless of
the prompting strategy, the addition of symbolic inference on top of prompting
alone leads to more consistent and accurate predictions. Additionally, we show
that calibration and fine-tuning using structured prediction objectives leads
to increased performance for challenging tasks, showing that structured
learning is still valuable in the era of LLMs.

*Rabeeh Karimi Mahabadi,Sanjeev Satheesh,Shrimai Prabhumoye,Mostofa Patwary,Mohammad Shoeybi,Bryan Catanzaro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Nemotron-CC-Math，一个从Common Crawl构建的大规模高质量数学语料库，通过新颖的领域无关管道实现鲁棒的科学文本提取，显著提升了LLM的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数学数据集由于脆弱的提取启发式方法、有损的HTML到文本转换以及无法可靠保留数学结构，导致质量下降，需要构建更高质量的数学预训练语料库。

Method: 使用布局感知渲染（lynx）和基于LLM的针对性清理阶段的新颖管道，恢复各种格式的数学内容（MathJax、KaTeX、MathML），保持方程和代码块的结构完整性，同时去除样板文件并将符号标准化为LaTeX表示。

Result: 构建了Nemotron-CC-Math-3+（133B tokens）和Nemotron-CC-Math-4+（52B tokens）语料库，后者比之前最高质量的FineMath-4+多5.5倍token。预训练Nemotron-T 8B模型在MATH上获得+4.8到+12.6的提升，在MBPP+上获得+4.6到+14.3的提升，同时改善MMLU和MMLU-Stem的通用领域性能。

Conclusion: 这是第一个从嘈杂的网络规模数据中可靠提取科学内容（包括数学）的管道，在数学、代码和一般推理方面实现了可衡量的提升，为开源社区发布了代码和数据集。

Abstract: Pretraining large language models (LLMs) on high-quality, structured data
such as mathematics and code substantially enhances reasoning capabilities.
However, existing math-focused datasets built from Common Crawl suffer from
degraded quality due to brittle extraction heuristics, lossy HTML-to-text
conversion, and the failure to reliably preserve mathematical structure. In
this work, we introduce Nemotron-CC-Math, a large-scale, high-quality
mathematical corpus constructed from Common Crawl using a novel,
domain-agnostic pipeline specifically designed for robust scientific text
extraction.
  Unlike previous efforts, our pipeline recovers math across various formats
(e.g., MathJax, KaTeX, MathML) by leveraging layout-aware rendering with lynx
and a targeted LLM-based cleaning stage. This approach preserves the structural
integrity of equations and code blocks while removing boilerplate,
standardizing notation into LaTeX representation, and correcting
inconsistencies.
  We collected a large, high-quality math corpus, namely Nemotron-CC-Math-3+
(133B tokens) and Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ (52B tokens). Notably,
Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ not only surpasses all prior open math datasets-including
MegaMath, FineMath, and OpenWebMath-but also contains 5.5 times more tokens
than FineMath-4+, which was previously the highest-quality math pretraining
dataset. When used to pretrain a Nemotron-T 8B model, our corpus yields +4.8 to
+12.6 gains on MATH and +4.6 to +14.3 gains on MBPP+ over strong baselines,
while also improving general-domain performance on MMLU and MMLU-Stem.
  We present the first pipeline to reliably extract scientific
content--including math--from noisy web-scale data, yielding measurable gains
in math, code, and general reasoning, and setting a new state of the art among
open math pretraining corpora. To support open-source efforts, we release our
code and datasets.

*Zijie Wang,Eduardo Blanco*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用外部证据来识别和回答含有错误假设问题的方法，通过事实验证和原子假设生成来减少LLM的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人们经常提出含有错误假设的问题，这类问题没有常规答案。大型语言模型(LLM)由于幻觉问题往往会生成误导性回答，因此需要先识别错误假设。

Method: 将问题简化为事实验证，利用外部证据来缓解幻觉，通过生成和验证原子假设来提供可解释的答案。

Result: 在五个LLM上的实验表明：(1)整合检索到的证据是有益的；(2)生成和验证原子假设能带来更多改进，并通过指定错误假设提供可解释的答案。

Conclusion: 利用外部证据和原子假设验证的方法能有效识别和回答含有错误假设的问题，减少LLM的幻觉，提高回答的可解释性。

Abstract: People often ask questions with false assumptions, a type of question that
does not have regular answers. Answering such questions require first
identifying the false assumptions. Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate
misleading answers because of hallucinations. In this paper, we focus on
identifying and answering questions with false assumptions in several domains.
We first investigate to reduce the problem to fact verification. Then, we
present an approach leveraging external evidence to mitigate hallucinations.
Experiments with five LLMs demonstrate that (1) incorporating retrieved
evidence is beneficial and (2) generating and validating atomic assumptions
yields more improvements and provides an interpretable answer by specifying the
false assumptions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MMDR-Bench多模态对话推理基准和CoLVLM Agent框架，通过记忆-感知-规划-执行循环增强现有LVLM模型，在复杂多轮多模态任务上显著超越GPT-4o和Gemini 1.5 Pro


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型和视觉语言模型在处理复杂多轮视觉基础任务时存在上下文丢失和视觉幻觉等问题，现有基准无法充分捕捉真实世界多模态交互的复杂性

Method: 构建包含300个复杂多轮对话场景的MMDR-Bench数据集；提出CoLVLM Agent框架，通过迭代式"记忆-感知-规划-执行"循环增强现有LVLM模型，无需重新训练底层模型

Result: CoLVLM Agent在MMDR-Bench上获得平均4.03的人类评估分数，显著超越GPT-4o(3.92)和Gemini 1.5 Pro(3.85)，在推理深度、指令遵循和错误抑制方面表现优异

Conclusion: 该框架的模块化设计和迭代方法能有效处理复杂多模态交互，在扩展对话轮次中保持稳健性能，为解决多模态推理挑战提供了有效方案

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), current models still face substantial
challenges in handling complex, multi-turn, and visually-grounded tasks that
demand deep reasoning, sustained contextual understanding, entity tracking, and
multi-step instruction following. Existing benchmarks often fall short in
capturing the dynamism and intricacies of real-world multi-modal interactions,
leading to issues such as context loss and visual hallucinations. To address
these limitations, we introduce MMDR-Bench (Multi-Modal Dialogue Reasoning
Benchmark), a novel dataset comprising 300 meticulously designed complex
multi-turn dialogue scenarios, each averaging 5-7 turns and evaluated across
six core dimensions including visual entity tracking and reasoning depth.
Furthermore, we propose CoLVLM Agent (Contextual LVLM Agent), a holistic
framework that enhances existing LVLMs with advanced reasoning and instruction
following capabilities through an iterative
"memory-perception-planning-execution" cycle, requiring no extensive
re-training of the underlying models. Our extensive experiments on MMDR-Bench
demonstrate that CoLVLM Agent consistently achieves superior performance,
attaining an average human evaluation score of 4.03, notably surpassing
state-of-the-art commercial models like GPT-4o (3.92) and Gemini 1.5 Pro
(3.85). The framework exhibits significant advantages in reasoning depth,
instruction adherence, and error suppression, and maintains robust performance
over extended dialogue turns, validating the effectiveness of its modular
design and iterative approach for complex multi-modal interactions.

### [12] [SemToken: Semantic-Aware Tokenization for Efficient Long-Context Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15190)
*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemToken是一个语义感知的分词框架，通过语义聚类减少token冗余，在保持模型性能的同时实现2.4倍token减少和1.9倍加速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分词方法如BPE和WordPiece仅基于频率统计，忽略了文本的语义结构，导致语义冗余span的过度分词和上下文连贯性的利用不足

Method: 首先通过轻量级编码器提取上下文语义嵌入，进行局部语义聚类合并语义等效token；然后基于语义密度分配异构token粒度，在内容丰富区域使用细粒度分词，在重复或低熵区域使用粗粒度压缩

Result: 在WikiText-103和LongBench等长上下文语言建模基准测试中，实现了最多2.4倍的token减少和1.9倍的加速，困惑度和下游任务准确率几乎没有下降

Conclusion: 语义结构为优化大语言模型中的分词和计算提供了一个有前景的新方向

Abstract: Tokenization plays a critical role in language modeling, yet existing
approaches such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece operate purely on
frequency statistics, ignoring the underlying semantic structure of text. This
leads to over-tokenization of semantically redundant spans and underutilization
of contextual coherence, particularly in long-context scenarios. In this work,
we propose \textbf{SemToken}, a semantic-aware tokenization framework that
jointly reduces token redundancy and improves computation efficiency. SemToken
first extracts contextual semantic embeddings via lightweight encoders and
performs local semantic clustering to merge semantically equivalent tokens.
Then, it allocates heterogeneous token granularity based on semantic density,
allowing finer-grained tokenization in content-rich regions and coarser
compression in repetitive or low-entropy spans. SemToken can be seamlessly
integrated with modern language models and attention acceleration methods.
Experiments on long-context language modeling benchmarks such as WikiText-103
and LongBench show that SemToken achieves up to $2.4\times$ reduction in token
count and $1.9\times$ speedup, with negligible or no degradation in perplexity
and downstream accuracy. Our findings suggest that semantic structure offers a
promising new axis for optimizing tokenization and computation in large
language models.

*Yuanchen Zhou,Shuo Jiang,Jie Zhu,Junhui Li,Lifan Guo,Feng Chen,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fin-PRM是一个专门针对金融领域的流程奖励模型，通过整合步骤级和轨迹级奖励监督，在金融推理任务中显著优于通用PRMs和领域基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PRMs主要针对通用或STEM领域，在金融等专业领域中表现不足，因为金融推理更具结构化、符号化特征且对事实和监管准确性要求更高。

Method: 开发了Fin-PRM模型，集成步骤级和轨迹级奖励监督，支持离线/在线奖励学习，应用于监督微调、强化学习和测试时推理三个关键场景。

Result: 在CFLUE和FinQA基准测试中，Fin-PRM在轨迹选择质量上持续优于基线模型，下游模型性能提升显著：监督学习12.9%、强化学习5.2%、测试时性能5.1%。

Conclusion: 领域专业化的奖励建模对于使大语言模型与专家级金融推理对齐具有重要价值，Fin-PRM为金融领域的推理监督提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising framework for
supervising intermediate reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet
existing PRMs are primarily trained on general or Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) domains and fall short in domain-specific
contexts such as finance, where reasoning is more structured, symbolic, and
sensitive to factual and regulatory correctness. We introduce \textbf{Fin-PRM},
a domain-specialized, trajectory-aware PRM tailored to evaluate intermediate
reasoning steps in financial tasks. Fin-PRM integrates step-level and
trajectory-level reward supervision, enabling fine-grained evaluation of
reasoning traces aligned with financial logic. We apply Fin-PRM in both offline
and online reward learning settings, supporting three key applications: (i)
selecting high-quality reasoning trajectories for distillation-based supervised
fine-tuning, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for reinforcement
learning, and (iii) guiding reward-informed Best-of-N inference at test time.
Experimental results on financial reasoning benchmarks, including CFLUE and
FinQA, demonstrate that Fin-PRM consistently outperforms general-purpose PRMs
and strong domain baselines in trajectory selection quality. Downstream models
trained with Fin-PRM yield substantial improvements with baselines, with gains
of 12.9\% in supervised learning, 5.2\% in reinforcement learning, and 5.1\% in
test-time performance. These findings highlight the value of domain-specialized
reward modeling for aligning LLMs with expert-level financial reasoning. Our
project resources will be available at https://github.com/aliyun/qwen-dianjin.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型中KV缓存瓶颈问题，现有方法主要沿时间轴压缩但忽略了特征维度的重要性差异，导致效率和准确性平衡受限。

Method: 提出通道级别的非结构化稀疏化方法，在注意力计算过程中动态恢复被剪枝的条目，与现有KV压缩和量化技术正交兼容。

Result: 在相同内存预算下可处理更长序列，相同序列长度下KV缓存存储减少30%以上，即使80%剪枝率下性能下降也小于5%。

Conclusion: SPARK通过通道级剪枝有效解决了KV缓存瓶颈，在保持模型精度的同时显著提升了内存效率和计算性能，具有很好的鲁棒性和实用性。

Abstract: Long-context inference in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
constrained by the KV cache bottleneck: memory usage grows linearly with
sequence length, while attention computation scales quadratically. Existing
approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal
axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and
computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained
importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis),
thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model
accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically
across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero
information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this
oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies
unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically
restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our
approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques,
making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration.
By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer
sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK
not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage
by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an
aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less
degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its
robustness and effectiveness. Our code will be available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Selct2Know (S2K) 是一个成本效益高的框架，通过内部-外部知识自选择策略和选择性监督微调来内化领域知识，在多个领域QA基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在通用QA表现良好，但在领域特定场景中表现不佳。检索增强生成存在幻觉和延迟问题，而持续预训练成本高昂且缺乏跨域灵活性。

Method: 提出S2K框架，采用内部-外部知识自选择策略和选择性监督微调，引入结构化推理数据生成流程并集成GRPO来增强推理能力。

Result: 在医疗、法律和金融QA基准测试中，S2K始终优于现有方法，并以显著更低的成本匹配领域预训练LLM的性能。

Conclusion: S2K通过渐进式知识获取策略有效解决了领域知识长尾分布问题，实现了成本效益高的领域知识内化。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in general QA but often struggle in
domain-specific scenarios. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces
external knowledge but suffers from hallucinations and latency due to noisy
retrievals. Continued pretraining internalizes domain knowledge but is costly
and lacks cross-domain flexibility. We attribute this challenge to the
long-tail distribution of domain knowledge, which leaves partial yet useful
internal knowledge underutilized. We further argue that knowledge acquisition
should be progressive, mirroring human learning: first understanding concepts,
then applying them to complex reasoning. To address this, we propose Selct2Know
(S2K), a cost-effective framework that internalizes domain knowledge through an
internal-external knowledge self-selection strategy and selective supervised
fine-tuning. We also introduce a structured reasoning data generation pipeline
and integrate GRPO to enhance reasoning ability. Experiments on medical, legal,
and financial QA benchmarks show that S2K consistently outperforms existing
methods and matches domain-pretrained LLMs with significantly lower cost.

TL;DR: SEER是一种自引导方法，通过从持续更新的经验池中进行细粒度、逐步检索，解决LLM在多步骤工具调用中的工具选择、参数生成和工具链规划问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖手动设计任务特定演示或从策划库中检索，需要大量专家努力，随着工具多样性和任务难度增加，提示工程变得复杂低效。

Method: Stepwise Experience Recall (SEER)方法，从持续更新的经验池中进行细粒度逐步检索，增量式地扩充经验池，包含过去成功的轨迹。

Result: 在ToolQA基准测试中，SEER在简单问题上平均提升6.1%，在困难问题上提升4.7%。在τ-bench真实世界领域测试中，使用Qwen2.5-7B和Qwen2.5-72B模型分别获得7.44%和23.38%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: SEER方法通过自引导的经验检索机制，有效解决了LLM在多步骤工具调用中的挑战，实现了持续的性能提升，无需依赖静态或手动策划的库。

Abstract: Function calling enables large language models (LLMs) to interact with
external systems by leveraging tools and APIs. When faced with multi-step tool
usage, LLMs still struggle with tool selection, parameter generation, and
tool-chain planning. Existing methods typically rely on manually designing
task-specific demonstrations, or retrieving from a curated library. These
approaches demand substantial expert effort and prompt engineering becomes
increasingly complex and inefficient as tool diversity and task difficulty
scale. To address these challenges, we propose a self-guided method, Stepwise
Experience Recall (SEER), which performs fine-grained, stepwise retrieval from
a continually updated experience pool. Instead of relying on static or manually
curated library, SEER incrementally augments the experience pool with past
successful trajectories, enabling continuous expansion of the pool and improved
model performance over time. Evaluated on the ToolQA benchmark, SEER achieves
an average improvement of 6.1\% on easy and 4.7\% on hard questions. We further
test SEER on $\tau$-bench, which includes two real-world domains. Powered by
Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-72B models, SEER demonstrates substantial accuracy gains
of 7.44\% and 23.38\%, respectively.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了在生成任务自动评估中如何有效使用检查表，发现选择性使用检查表在成对比较任务中能提升评估性能，但在直接评分中效果不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在生成任务自动评估中面临标准模糊的挑战，自动生成检查表是一个有前景但尚未充分探索的方法。

Method: 使用六种方法生成检查表，在八种不同规模的模型上进行实验，通过成对比较和直接评分任务评估检查表效果，并分析检查表项目与人工评估的相关性。

Result: 选择性使用检查表在成对比较设置中能改善评估性能，但在直接评分中效果不一致。即使与人工评分相关性低的检查表项目也常反映人工编写的标准，表明人工评估存在潜在不一致性。

Conclusion: 需要更清晰地定义客观评估标准来指导人工和自动评估，检查表的使用策略应根据具体评估任务进行选择。

Abstract: Automatic evaluation of generative tasks using large language models faces
challenges due to ambiguous criteria. Although automatic checklist generation
is a potentially promising approach, its usefulness remains underexplored. We
investigate whether checklists should be used for all questions or selectively,
generate them using six methods, evaluate their effectiveness across eight
model sizes, and identify checklist items that correlate with human
evaluations. Through experiments on pairwise comparison and direct scoring
tasks, we find that selective checklist use tends to improve evaluation
performance in pairwise settings, while its benefits are less consistent in
direct scoring. Our analysis also shows that even checklist items with low
correlation to human scores often reflect human-written criteria, indicating
potential inconsistencies in human evaluation. These findings highlight the
need to more clearly define objective evaluation criteria to guide both human
and automatic evaluations. \footnote{Our code is available

*Hanling Zhang,Yayu Zhou,Tongcheng Fang,Zhihang Yuan,Guohao Dai,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VocabTailor是一个解耦的动态词汇选择框架，通过卸载嵌入和混合静态-动态词汇选择策略，将SLM词汇相关组件的内存使用减少高达99%，且性能损失最小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型语言模型在资源受限环境中具有计算优势，但内存限制仍是边缘设备部署的关键瓶颈。词汇相关组件（特别是嵌入和语言建模头）由于词汇量大而占用大量内存。现有的静态词汇剪枝方法存在刚性设计、信息丢失和缺乏灵活性的问题。

Method: 基于词汇局部性原理（单个推理只需少量词汇子集）和词汇相关组件计算特性的不对称性，提出VocabTailor框架：通过卸载嵌入实现内存约束处理，并为LM头实施混合静态-动态词汇选择策略，实现按需加载词汇组件。

Result: 在各种下游任务的综合实验中，VocabTailor将词汇相关组件的内存使用减少了高达99%，任务性能仅有最小或没有下降，显著优于现有的静态词汇剪枝方法。

Conclusion: VocabTailor通过动态词汇选择有效解决了SLM的内存瓶颈问题，在保持性能的同时大幅降低内存占用，为边缘设备部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) provide computational advantages in
resource-constrained environments, yet memory limitations remain a critical
bottleneck for edge device deployment. A substantial portion of SLMs' memory
footprint stems from vocabulary-related components, particularly embeddings and
language modeling (LM) heads, due to large vocabulary sizes. Existing static
vocabulary pruning, while reducing memory usage, suffers from rigid,
one-size-fits-all designs that cause information loss from the prefill stage
and a lack of flexibility. In this work, we identify two key principles
underlying the vocabulary reduction challenge: the lexical locality principle,
the observation that only a small subset of tokens is required during any
single inference, and the asymmetry in computational characteristics between
vocabulary-related components of SLM. Based on these insights, we introduce
VocabTailor, a novel decoupled dynamic vocabulary selection framework that
addresses memory constraints through offloading embedding and implements a
hybrid static-dynamic vocabulary selection strategy for LM Head, enabling
on-demand loading of vocabulary components. Comprehensive experiments across
diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that VocabTailor achieves a reduction of
up to 99% in the memory usage of vocabulary-related components with minimal or
no degradation in task performance, substantially outperforming existing static
vocabulary pruning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在英语指令跟随上表现优异，但在泰语等低资源语言中表现待探索。现有测试集多依赖翻译，缺乏文化和专业领域的细微差异，影响实际应用效果。

Method: 构建WangchanThaiInstruct数据集，覆盖四个专业领域和七种任务类型，通过注释员、领域专家和AI研究人员多阶段质量控制过程。进行两个研究：(1)零样本评估文化和专业特定任务的表现差距；(2)指令调整研究，隔离本土监督的效果。

Result: 使用WangchanThaiInstruct调整的模型在领域内外测试中都显著超过使用翻译数据的模型。识别出文化和专业特定任务上的性能缺口。

Conclusion: 研究强调了需要基于文化和专业基础的本土指令数据，才能有效改善大语言模型在低资源、语言多样性环境中的对齐性能。

Abstract: Large language models excel at instruction-following in English, but their
performance in low-resource languages like Thai remains underexplored. Existing
benchmarks often rely on translations, missing cultural and domain-specific
nuances needed for real-world use. We present WangchanThaiInstruct, a
human-authored Thai dataset for evaluation and instruction tuning, covering
four professional domains and seven task types. Created through a multi-stage
quality control process with annotators, domain experts, and AI researchers,
WangchanThaiInstruct supports two studies: (1) a zero-shot evaluation showing
performance gaps on culturally and professionally specific tasks, and (2) an
instruction tuning study with ablations isolating the effect of native
supervision. Models fine-tuned on WangchanThaiInstruct outperform those using
translated data in both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. These findings
underscore the need for culturally and professionally grounded instruction data
to improve LLM alignment in low-resource, linguistically diverse settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实对话中代码切换现象普遍，但缺乏合适的数据集，限制了多语言语音技术的发展

Method: 使用SWORDS算法，通过替换同义词翻译来生成代码切换语音，保持句子语义不变，考虑词性因素

Result: CS-FLEURS语料库在客观和主观指标上都表现出高可懂度和自然度，与现有数据集性能相当

Conclusion: 该方法能推动代码切换语音技术进步，实现更具包容性的多语言系统

Abstract: Code-switching (CS), the alternation between two or more languages within a
single speaker's utterances, is common in real-world conversations and poses
significant challenges for multilingual speech technology. However, systems
capable of handling this phenomenon remain underexplored, primarily due to the
scarcity of suitable datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Universal
Code-Mixer (UniCoM), a novel pipeline for generating high-quality, natural CS
samples without altering sentence semantics. Our approach utilizes an algorithm
we call Substituting WORDs with Synonyms (SWORDS), which generates CS speech by
replacing selected words with their translations while considering their parts
of speech. Using UniCoM, we construct Code-Switching FLEURS (CS-FLEURS), a
multilingual CS corpus designed for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and
speech-to-text translation (S2TT). Experimental results show that CS-FLEURS
achieves high intelligibility and naturalness, performing comparably to
existing datasets on both objective and subjective metrics. We expect our
approach to advance CS speech technology and enable more inclusive multilingual
systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了EMNLP框架，用于评估教师角色大语言模型的人格特征、道德发展阶段和伦理风险，发现教师角色LLMs比人类教师更理想化和极化，在抽象道德推理上表现优异但在情感复杂情境中表现不佳，且推理能力强的模型更容易受到有害提示注入的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模拟职业角色的大语言模型缺乏全面的心理和伦理评估，特别是在教育领域需要评估教师角色的道德规范和伦理风险。

Method: 构建EMNLP评估框架，扩展现有量表并创建88个教师特定道德困境，使用定向软提示注入集评估教师角色LLMs的合规性和脆弱性，在12个LLMs上进行实验。

Result: 教师角色LLMs表现出比人类教师更理想化和极化的人格特征，在抽象道德推理上表现优异但在情感复杂情境中表现不佳，推理能力强的模型更容易受到有害提示注入攻击。

Conclusion: 本文提出了首个评估教师角色LLMs伦理和心理对齐的基准，揭示了模型能力与安全性之间的悖论，为教育AI的伦理发展提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Simulating Professions (SP) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate
professional roles. However, comprehensive psychological and ethical evaluation
in these contexts remains lacking. This paper introduces EMNLP, an
Educator-role Moral and Normative LLMs Profiling framework for personality
profiling, moral development stage measurement, and ethical risk under soft
prompt injection. EMNLP extends existing scales and constructs 88
teacher-specific moral dilemmas, enabling profession-oriented comparison with
human teachers. A targeted soft prompt injection set evaluates compliance and
vulnerability in teacher SP. Experiments on 12 LLMs show teacher-role LLMs
exhibit more idealized and polarized personalities than human teachers, excel
in abstract moral reasoning, but struggle with emotionally complex situations.
Models with stronger reasoning are more vulnerable to harmful prompt injection,
revealing a paradox between capability and safety. The model temperature and
other hyperparameters have limited influence except in some risk behaviors.
This paper presents the first benchmark to assess ethical and psychological
alignment of teacher-role LLMs for educational AI. Resources are available at

TL;DR: CARE是一个解决RAG系统中上下文-记忆冲突的新方法，通过上下文评估器和软提示技术来识别不可靠的外部上下文，引导模型使用更可靠的知识源，在QA和事实核查任务上平均提升5.0%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强生成(RAG)系统在处理检索到的外部上下文与LLM内部参数知识冲突时，往往无法正确解决这种上下文-记忆冲突问题，导致模型输出错误信息。

Method: 提出CARE框架，包含上下文评估器和基础LLM。上下文评估器通过压缩记忆令牌嵌入和基于对抗/接地软提示的训练，学习识别不可靠上下文并生成指导信号，引导模型选择更可靠的知识源。

Result: 在问答和事实核查基准测试中，CARE平均获得5.0%的性能提升，有效缓解了上下文-记忆冲突问题。

Conclusion: CARE为解决RAG系统中的知识冲突问题提供了一个有前景的方向，有助于构建更可信和自适应的RAG系统。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances the capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge into their input
prompts. However, when the retrieved context contradicts the LLM's parametric
knowledge, it often fails to resolve the conflict between incorrect external
context and correct parametric knowledge, known as context-memory conflict. To
tackle this problem, we introduce Conflict-Aware REtrieval-Augmented Generation
(CARE), consisting of a context assessor and a base LLM. The context assessor
encodes compact memory token embeddings from raw context tokens. Through
grounded/adversarial soft prompting, the context assessor is trained to discern
unreliable context and capture a guidance signal that directs reasoning toward
the more reliable knowledge source. Extensive experiments show that CARE
effectively mitigates context-memory conflicts, leading to an average
performance gain of 5.0\% on QA and fact-checking benchmarks, establishing a
promising direction for trustworthy and adaptive RAG systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言中事件的时间上下文往往没有明确表述，即使是先进的大语言模型也难以生成需要时间常识推理的文本，因此需要自动挖掘时间常识来构建更鲁棒的语言模型。

Method: 提出了一个时间常识提取流程，利用大语言模型从SAMSum和RealNews语料库中自动挖掘时间常识，构建TComQA数据集，并通过众包验证数据质量。

Result: TComQA数据集在提取时间常识方面达到超过80%的精确度，基于该数据集训练的模型在时间问答任务上优于使用现有数据集微调的大语言模型。

Conclusion: 通过自动挖掘时间常识构建的高质量数据集能够有效提升模型在时间推理任务上的性能，为大语言模型的时间常识理解提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding events necessitates grasping their temporal context, which is
often not explicitly stated in natural language. For example, it is not a
trivial task for a machine to infer that a museum tour may last for a few
hours, but can not take months. Recent studies indicate that even advanced
large language models (LLMs) struggle in generating text that require reasoning
with temporal commonsense due to its infrequent explicit mention in text.
Therefore, automatically mining temporal commonsense for events enables the
creation of robust language models. In this work, we investigate the capacity
of LLMs to extract temporal commonsense from text and evaluate multiple
experimental setups to assess their effectiveness. Here, we propose a temporal
commonsense extraction pipeline that leverages LLMs to automatically mine
temporal commonsense and use it to construct TComQA, a dataset derived from
SAMSum and RealNews corpora. TComQA has been validated through crowdsourcing
and achieves over 80\% precision in extracting temporal commonsense. The model
trained with TComQA also outperforms an LLM fine-tuned on existing dataset of
temporal question answering task.

Motivation: 许多语音处理任务需要不受上下文影响的纯净音素表示，但现有方法通常需要分析长语音片段和语言特定模式

Method: 开发CUPE模型，处理短固定宽度窗口（约一个音素长度），独立分析每个窗口，学习所有语言共有的基本声学模式

Result: 在多种语言的监督和自监督训练中表现优异，在UCLA语音语料库的零样本测试中展现出强大的跨语言泛化能力

Conclusion: 通过建模音素长度窗口内的基本声学模式，可以实现有效的通用语音处理

Abstract: Universal phoneme recognition typically requires analyzing long speech
segments and language-specific patterns. Many speech processing tasks require
pure phoneme representations free from contextual influence, which motivated
our development of CUPE - a lightweight model that captures key phoneme
features in just 120 milliseconds, about one phoneme's length. CUPE processes
short, fixed-width windows independently and, despite fewer parameters than
current approaches, achieves competitive cross-lingual performance by learning
fundamental acoustic patterns common to all languages. Our extensive evaluation
through supervised and self-supervised training on diverse languages, including
zero-shot tests on the UCLA Phonetic Corpus, demonstrates strong cross-lingual
generalization and reveals that effective universal speech processing is
possible through modeling basic acoustic patterns within phoneme-length
windows.

Conclusion: EDAS提供了一个统一的元度量标准，支持更明智的模型选择，促进跨数据集评估的公平性，解决了知识图谱补全模型评估中的不一致性问题。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) enable applications in various domains such as
semantic search, recommendation systems, and natural language processing. KGs
are often incomplete, missing entities and relations, an issue addressed by
Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods that predict missing elements.
Different evaluation metrics, such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Mean Rank
(MR), and Hit@k, are commonly used to assess the performance of such KGC
models. A major challenge in evaluating KGC models, however, lies in comparing
their performance across multiple datasets and metrics. A model may outperform
others on one dataset but underperform on another, making it difficult to
determine overall superiority. Moreover, even within a single dataset,
different metrics such as MRR and Hit@1 can yield conflicting rankings, where
one model excels in MRR while another performs better in Hit@1, further
complicating model selection for downstream tasks. These inconsistencies hinder
holistic comparisons and highlight the need for a unified meta-metric that
integrates performance across all metrics and datasets to enable a more
reliable and interpretable evaluation framework. To address this need, we
propose KG Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS), a robust
and interpretable meta-metric that synthesizes model performance across
multiple datasets and diverse evaluation criteria into a single normalized
score ($M_i \in [0,1]$). Unlike traditional metrics that focus on isolated
aspects of performance, EDAS offers a global perspective that supports more
informed model selection and promotes fairness in cross-dataset evaluation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets such as FB15k-237 and WN18RR
demonstrate that EDAS effectively integrates multi-metric, multi-dataset
performance into a unified ranking, offering a consistent, robust, and
generalizable framework for evaluating KGC models.

Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid development of the depth and breadth of large
language models' capabilities, various corresponding evaluation benchmarks have
been emerging in increasing numbers. As a quantitative assessment tool for
model performance, benchmarks are not only a core means to measure model
capabilities but also a key element in guiding the direction of model
development and promoting technological innovation. We systematically review
the current status and development of large language model benchmarks for the
first time, categorizing 283 representative benchmarks into three categories:
general capabilities, domain-specific, and target-specific. General capability
benchmarks cover aspects such as core linguistics, knowledge, and reasoning;
domain-specific benchmarks focus on fields like natural sciences, humanities
and social sciences, and engineering technology; target-specific benchmarks pay
attention to risks, reliability, agents, etc. We point out that current
benchmarks have problems such as inflated scores caused by data contamination,
unfair evaluation due to cultural and linguistic biases, and lack of evaluation
on process credibility and dynamic environments, and provide a referable design
paradigm for future benchmark innovation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型评估方法往往关注狭窄方面，忽视了多模态性带来的风险，需要构建全面的可信度评估框架。

Method: 提出了三维评估框架：5个可信度方面（真实性、鲁棒性、安全性、公平性、隐私）、2种风险类型（多模态风险和跨模态影响）、多种缓解策略（数据、模型架构、训练、推理算法）。包含32个任务和28个数据集，评估了30多个开源和专有模型。

Result: 实验发现当前模型存在显著漏洞，可信度与通用能力之间存在差距，多模态训练和推理会放大基础LLM的潜在风险。现有缓解策略大多只能改善特定方面，很少能有效解决整体可信度问题，且会带来意外的权衡。

Conclusion: 提出了推理增强的安全对齐（RESA）方法，通过思维链推理能力发现潜在风险，取得了最先进的结果，为未来改进提供了实用见解。

Abstract: The trustworthiness of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains an
intense concern despite the significant progress in their capabilities.
Existing evaluation and mitigation approaches often focus on narrow aspects and
overlook risks introduced by the multimodality. To tackle these challenges, we
propose MultiTrust-X, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating, analyzing, and
mitigating the trustworthiness issues of MLLMs. We define a three-dimensional
framework, encompassing five trustworthiness aspects which include
truthfulness, robustness, safety, fairness, and privacy; two novel risk types
covering multimodal risks and cross-modal impacts; and various mitigation
strategies from the perspectives of data, model architecture, training, and
inference algorithms. Based on the taxonomy, MultiTrust-X includes 32 tasks and
28 curated datasets, enabling holistic evaluations over 30 open-source and
proprietary MLLMs and in-depth analysis with 8 representative mitigation
methods. Our extensive experiments reveal significant vulnerabilities in
current models, including a gap between trustworthiness and general
capabilities, as well as the amplification of potential risks in base LLMs by
both multimodal training and inference. Moreover, our controlled analysis
uncovers key limitations in existing mitigation strategies that, while some
methods yield improvements in specific aspects, few effectively address overall
trustworthiness, and many introduce unexpected trade-offs that compromise model
utility. These findings also provide practical insights for future
improvements, such as the benefits of reasoning to better balance safety and
performance. Based on these insights, we introduce a Reasoning-Enhanced Safety
Alignment (RESA) approach that equips the model with chain-of-thought reasoning
ability to discover the underlying risks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

### [28] [Confidence-Modulated Speculative Decoding for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15371)
*Jaydip Sen,Subhasis Dasgupta,Hetvi Waghela*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于信息论的置信度调制推测解码框架，通过动态调整推测生成token数量来提升解码效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推测解码方法使用静态推测长度和固定验证标准，无法适应不同模型不确定性和输入复杂度，限制了加速效果

Method: 利用熵和边界不确定性度量来动态调整每轮推测生成的token数量，并使用相同置信度信号调制验证过程

Result: 在机器翻译和摘要任务上相比标准推测解码显著加速，同时保持或提升了BLEU和ROUGE分数

Conclusion: 该方法为大型语言模型在不同不确定性条件下提供了高效、鲁棒的即插即用解码方案

Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating
autoregressive inference by parallelizing token generation through a
draft-then-verify paradigm. However, existing methods rely on static drafting
lengths and rigid verification criteria, limiting their adaptability across
varying model uncertainties and input complexities. This paper proposes an
information-theoretic framework for speculative decoding based on
confidence-modulated drafting. By leveraging entropy and margin-based
uncertainty measures over the drafter's output distribution, the proposed
method dynamically adjusts the number of speculatively generated tokens at each
iteration. This adaptive mechanism reduces rollback frequency, improves
resource utilization, and maintains output fidelity. Additionally, the
verification process is modulated using the same confidence signals, enabling
more flexible acceptance of drafted tokens without sacrificing generation
quality. Experiments on machine translation and summarization tasks demonstrate
significant speedups over standard speculative decoding while preserving or
improving BLEU and ROUGE scores. The proposed approach offers a principled,
plug-in method for efficient and robust decoding in large language models under
varying conditions of uncertainty.

### [29] [Exploiting Vocabulary Frequency Imbalance in Language Model Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15390)
*Woojin Chung,Jeonghoon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，更大的词汇表通过降低token化文本的复杂性来提升语言模型性能，主要受益于高频词的不确定性降低，而非改善罕见词处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型词汇表带来性能提升的根本原因，理解词汇表规模扩大对语言模型训练动态的影响机制。

Method: 在固定数据、计算和优化条件下，将词汇表从24K扩展到196K进行对照研究，使用Kolmogorov复杂度量化token化文本复杂性，并进行词级损失分解分析。

Result: 词汇表超过24K后主要加深token频率不平衡，但能降低高频词（前2500个词）的不确定性，尽管罕见词损失上升；约束嵌入范数会逆转收益，表明模型利用而非受制于不平衡。

Conclusion: 词汇表扩大的好处源于降低token化文本复杂性，这为tokenizer-模型协同设计提供了原则性指导，并阐明了预训练中语言模型扩展的损失动态。

Abstract: Large language models are trained with tokenizers, and the resulting token
distribution is highly imbalanced: a few words dominate the stream while most
occur rarely. Recent practice favors ever-larger vocabularies, but the source
of the benefit is unclear. We conduct a controlled study that scales the
language model's vocabulary from 24K to 196K while holding data, compute, and
optimization fixed. We first quantify the complexity of tokenized text,
formalized via Kolmogorov complexity, and show that larger vocabularies reduce
this complexity. Above 24K, every common word is already a single token, so
further growth mainly deepens the relative token-frequency imbalance. A
word-level loss decomposition shows that larger vocabularies reduce
cross-entropy almost exclusively by lowering uncertainty on the 2,500 most
frequent words, even though loss on the rare tail rises. Constraining input and
output embedding norms to attenuate the effect of token-frequency imbalance
reverses the gain, directly showing that the model exploits rather than suffers
from imbalance. Because the same frequent words cover roughly 77% of tokens in
downstream benchmarks, this training advantage transfers intact. We also show
that enlarging model parameters with a fixed vocabulary yields the same
frequent-word benefit. Our results reframe "bigger vocabularies help" as
"lowering the complexity of tokenized text helps," providing a simple,
principled lever for tokenizer-model co-design and clarifying the loss dynamics
that govern language-model scaling in pre-training.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛采用，对其可靠性和可信度的担忧日益增长。当前研究领域存在术语不一致、评估实践孤立和缺乏统一基准的问题。

Method: 系统分析134篇论文，引入统一的基于证据的文本生成分类法，研究300个评估指标，重点关注使用引用、归属或引用的方法。

Result: 建立了该领域的统一分类体系，识别了代表性方法，并分析了评估指标的七个关键维度。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) has been accompanied
by growing concerns regarding their reliability and trustworthiness. As a
result, a growing body of research focuses on evidence-based text generation
with LLMs, aiming to link model outputs to supporting evidence to ensure
traceability and verifiability. However, the field is fragmented due to
inconsistent terminology, isolated evaluation practices, and a lack of unified
benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we systematically analyze 134 papers, introduce
a unified taxonomy of evidence-based text generation with LLMs, and investigate
300 evaluation metrics across seven key dimensions. Thereby, we focus on
approaches that use citations, attribution, or quotations for evidence-based
text generation. Building on this, we examine the distinctive characteristics
and representative methods in the field. Finally, we highlight open challenges
and outline promising directions for future work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MCR-BENCH是首个专门评估大型音频-语言模型在处理音频-文本冲突信息时偏好的基准测试，发现模型存在明显的文本偏向性，忽视音频证据，导致音频中心任务性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型音频-语言模型在处理多模态输入方面能力增强，但它们在处理音频和文本模态间冲突信息时的表现尚未得到充分研究，需要系统评估其信息优先级选择机制。

Method: 构建MCR-BENCH基准测试，通过不一致的音频-文本对评估模型，进行广泛的音频理解任务评估，研究影响因素，探索监督微调缓解策略，并分析模型置信度模式。

Result: 研究发现LALMs存在显著的文本偏向性，经常忽视音频证据，导致音频中心任务性能大幅下降；模型即使在矛盾输入情况下也表现出持续的过度自信。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在训练过程中需要改进模态平衡，开发更复杂的融合机制，以增强处理冲突多模态输入时的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are enhanced with audio perception
capabilities, enabling them to effectively process and understand multimodal
inputs that combine audio and text. However, their performance in handling
conflicting information between audio and text modalities remains largely
unexamined. This paper introduces MCR-BENCH, the first comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate how LALMs prioritize information when
presented with inconsistent audio-text pairs. Through extensive evaluation
across diverse audio understanding tasks, we reveal a concerning phenomenon:
when inconsistencies exist between modalities, LALMs display a significant bias
toward textual input, frequently disregarding audio evidence. This tendency
leads to substantial performance degradation in audio-centric tasks and raises
important reliability concerns for real-world applications. We further
investigate the influencing factors of text bias, and explore mitigation
strategies through supervised finetuning, and analyze model confidence patterns
that reveal persistent overconfidence even with contradictory inputs. These
findings underscore the need for improved modality balance during training and
more sophisticated fusion mechanisms to enhance the robustness when handling
conflicting multi-modal inputs. The project is available at

Abstract: The development of Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs) has been slowed by
fragmented architectures and a lack of transparency, hindering the systematic
comparison and reproducibility of research. Unlike in the vision-language
domain, the LSLM field suffers from the common practice of releasing model
weights without their corresponding training data and configurations. To
address these critical gaps, we introduce LLaSO, the first fully open,
end-to-end framework for large-scale speech-language modeling. LLaSO provides
the community with three essential resources: (1) LLaSO-Align, a 12M-instance
speech-text alignment corpus; (2) LLaSO-Instruct, a 13.5M-instance multi-task
instruction-tuning dataset; and (3) LLaSO-Eval, a reproducible benchmark for
standardized evaluation. To validate our framework, we build and release
LLaSO-Base, a 3.8B-parameter reference model trained exclusively on our public
data. It achieves a normalized score of 0.72, establishing a strong,
reproducible baseline that surpasses comparable models. Our analysis reveals
that while broader training coverage enhances performance, significant
generalization gaps persist on unseen tasks, particularly in pure audio
scenarios. By releasing the complete stack of data, benchmarks, and models,
LLaSO establishes a foundational open standard to unify research efforts and
accelerate community-driven progress in LSLMs. We release the code, dataset,
pretrained models, and results in https://github.com/EIT-NLP/LLaSO.

Conclusion: 这项研究为解决语言翻译中的非对应词汇问题提供了有效的方法论体系，对于提高跨文化沟通和语言理解具有重要意义，虽然部分词汇已经完成翻译，但仍有许多非对应词汇需要进一步研究和处理。

Abstract: These pure languages understanding directly relates to translation knowledge
where linguists and translators need to work and research to eradicate
misunderstanding. Misunderstandings mostly appear in non-equivalent words
because there are different local and internal words like food, garment,
cultural and traditional words and others in every notion. Truly, most of these
words do not have equivalent in the target language and these words need to be
worked and find their equivalent in the target language to fully understand the
both languages. The purpose of this research is to introduce the methods of
rendering non-equivalent words professionally from the source language to the
target language and this research has been completed using library-based
research. However, some of these non-equivalent words are already
professionally rendered to the target language but still there many other words
to be rendered. As a result, this research paper includes different ways and
rules of rendering non-equivalent words from source language to the target
language and 25 non-equvalent words have been rendered from Dar & Uzbek into
English and Russian languages.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的可编程任务导向对话代理的有效性依赖于准确的对话状态跟踪，但传统方法存在局限性，需要更有效的状态跟踪和错误纠正机制。

Method: PyTOD采用简单的约束解码方法，使用语言模型而非语法规则来遵循API模式，生成可执行代码进行状态跟踪，并利用策略和执行反馈进行错误纠正。

Result: 在具有挑战性的SGD基准测试中，PyTOD实现了最先进的对话状态跟踪性能，在准确性和鲁棒性用户目标估计方面均超越了强基线模型。

Conclusion: 执行感知的状态跟踪方法有效，PyTOD通过代码生成和反馈机制显著提升了任务导向对话系统的性能表现。

Abstract: Programmable task-oriented dialogue (TOD) agents enable language models to
follow structured dialogue policies, but their effectiveness hinges on accurate
state tracking. We present PyTOD, an agent that generates executable code to
track dialogue state and uses policy and execution feedback for efficient error
correction. To this end, PyTOD employs a simple constrained decoding approach,
using a language model instead of grammar rules to follow API schemata. This
leads to state-of-the-art state tracking performance on the challenging SGD
benchmark. Our experiments show that PyTOD surpasses strong baselines in both
accuracy and robust user goal estimation as the dialogue progresses,
demonstrating the effectiveness of execution-aware state tracking.

TL;DR: RadReason是一个用于评估自动生成的放射学报告的新框架，提供细粒度错误类型评分和人类可读的解释，在ReXVal基准测试中表现优于现有方法，达到与GPT-4相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的放射学报告自动评估方法要么产生粗糙的整体分数，要么依赖不透明的黑盒模型，缺乏临床基础、可解释性和细粒度指标，限制了在真实临床工作流程中的应用价值。

Method: 基于Group Relative Policy Optimization构建，包含两个关键创新：1) Sub-score Dynamic Weighting - 基于实时F1统计自适应优先处理临床挑战性错误类型；2) Majority-Guided Advantage Scaling - 基于子分数一致性调整策略梯度更新。

Result: 在ReXVal基准测试中，RadReason超越了所有先前的离线指标，达到了与GPT-4评估相当的性能，同时保持可解释性、成本效益和临床部署适用性。

Conclusion: RadReason提供了一个临床基础、可解释且细粒度的放射学报告评估框架，通过创新的动态加权和优势缩放技术实现了更稳定的优化和更好的专家临床判断对齐，适合临床部署。

Abstract: Evaluating automatically generated radiology reports remains a fundamental
challenge due to the lack of clinically grounded, interpretable, and
fine-grained metrics. Existing methods either produce coarse overall scores or
rely on opaque black-box models, limiting their usefulness in real-world
clinical workflows. We introduce RadReason, a novel evaluation framework for
radiology reports that not only outputs fine-grained sub-scores across six
clinically defined error types, but also produces human-readable justifications
that explain the rationale behind each score. Our method builds on Group
Relative Policy Optimization and incorporates two key innovations: (1)
Sub-score Dynamic Weighting, which adaptively prioritizes clinically
challenging error types based on live F1 statistics; and (2) Majority-Guided
Advantage Scaling, which adjusts policy gradient updates based on prompt
difficulty derived from sub-score agreement. Together, these components enable
more stable optimization and better alignment with expert clinical judgment.
Experiments on the ReXVal benchmark show that RadReason surpasses all prior
offline metrics and achieves parity with GPT-4-based evaluations, while
remaining explainable, cost-efficient, and suitable for clinical deployment.
Code will be released upon publication.

Motivation: 个性化营销是提升客户参与度和业务增长的关键策略，研究表明良好的个性化策略可使收入提升达40%，但现有研究主要集中在推荐系统和个性化广告，个性化报价生成领域具有巨大潜力。

Method: 使用对比学习方法微调Google的T5-Small编码器-解码器语言模型，采用InfoNCE损失函数在共享嵌入空间中对齐客户画像和相关报价，通过自适应学习行为重塑潜在空间。

Result: 在模拟客户行为和报价接受模式的合成数据集上评估，实验结果显示相比监督微调基线，报价接受率提升了17%。

Conclusion: 对比学习目标在推进个性化营销方面具有显著效果，SLM4Offer模型通过对比学习方法有效提升了个性化报价生成的性能。

Abstract: Personalized marketing has emerged as a pivotal strategy for enhancing
customer engagement and driving business growth. Academic and industry efforts
have predominantly focused on recommendation systems and personalized
advertisements. Nonetheless, this facet of personalization holds significant
potential for increasing conversion rates and improving customer satisfaction.
Prior studies suggest that well-executed personalization strategies can boost
revenue by up to 40 percent, underscoring the strategic importance of
developing intelligent, data-driven approaches for offer generation. This work
introduces SLM4Offer, a generative AI model for personalized offer generation,
developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained encoder-decoder language model,
specifically Google's Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5-Small 60M) using a
contrastive learning approach. SLM4Offer employs InfoNCE (Information
Noise-Contrastive Estimation) loss to align customer personas with relevant
offers in a shared embedding space. A key innovation in SLM4Offer lies in the
adaptive learning behaviour introduced by contrastive loss, which reshapes the
latent space during training and enhances the model's generalizability. The
model is fine-tuned and evaluated on a synthetic dataset designed to simulate
customer behaviour and offer acceptance patterns. Experimental results
demonstrate a 17 percent improvement in offer acceptance rate over a supervised
fine-tuning baseline, highlighting the effectiveness of contrastive objectives
in advancing personalized marketing.

TL;DR: 本文质疑大型语言模型在处理用户主观浏览行为时的有效性，提出使用小型语言模型和聚类特定参数训练方法HeTLM，在捕捉用户异构行为方面优于大型模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统大型语言模型在处理用户主观、异构的浏览行为时可能不够有效，因为用户浏览行为具有高度主观性和异质性，类似于每个用户自构的"浏览语言"。

Method: 提出HeTLM（异质性感知语言模型训练）方法，使用页面级分词器训练小型语言模型，并为不同用户聚类训练特定的参数集，而不是使用单一参数集。

Result: 研究发现：1）使用页面级分词器的小型模型优于大型预训练或微调模型；2）HeTLM在相同参数数量下优于单一模型；3）获得了更高的平均性能和更低的方差，表明对齐效果更好。

Conclusion: 对于用户主观浏览行为，小型专门化模型比大型通用模型更有效，聚类特定的参数训练方法能够更好地捕捉用户异构行为，提高模型对齐性能。

Abstract: A Large Language Model (LLM) offers versatility across domains and tasks,
purportedly benefiting users with a wide variety of behaviors and preferences.
We question this perception about an LLM when users have inherently subjective
behaviors and preferences, as seen in their ubiquitous and idiosyncratic
browsing of websites or apps. The sequential behavior logs of pages, thus
generated, form something akin to each user's self-constructed "language",
albeit without the structure and grammar imbued in natural languages. We ask:
(i) Can a small LM represent the "language of browsing" better than a large LM?
(ii) Can an LM with a single set of parameters (or, single LM) adequately
capture myriad users' heterogeneous, subjective behaviors and preferences?
(iii) Can a single LM with high average performance, yield low variance in
performance to make alignment good at user level? We introduce clusterwise LM
training, HeTLM (Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model), appropriate
for subjective behaviors. We find that (i) a small LM trained using a
page-level tokenizer outperforms large pretrained or finetuned LMs; (ii) HeTLM
with heterogeneous cluster specific set of parameters outperforms a single LM
of the same family, controlling for the number of parameters; and (iii) a
higher mean and a lower variance in generation ensues, implying improved
alignment.

TL;DR: 本研究提出使用训练数据影响力作为模型中心化的难度度量，替代传统人工定义的难度指标，在语言模型预训练中实现了超过10个百分点的性能提升，证明了课程学习的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的课程学习在语言模型预训练中效果有限，因为人工定义的难度指标可能与模型实际学习过程中的难度感知不匹配。

Method: 使用训练数据影响力作为难度度量标准对训练样本进行排序，训练数据影响力估计单个训练样本对模型输出的影响程度。

Result: 采用模型中心化难度指标的课程学习方法在基准测试中比随机顺序训练的性能高出10个百分点以上。

Conclusion: 课程学习对语言模型预训练是有益的，但需要采用更符合模型学习特性的模型中心化难度概念。

Abstract: Curriculum learning, a training technique where data is presented to the
model in order of example difficulty (e.g., from simpler to more complex
documents), has shown limited success for pre-training language models. In this
work, we investigate whether curriculum learning becomes competitive if we
replace conventional human-centered difficulty metrics with one that more
closely corresponds to example difficulty as observed during model training.
Specifically, we experiment with sorting training examples by their
\textit{training data influence}, a score which estimates the effect of
individual training examples on the model's output. Models trained on our
curricula are able to outperform ones trained in random order by over 10
percentage points in benchmarks, confirming that curriculum learning is
beneficial for language model pre-training, as long as a more model-centric
notion of difficulty is adopted.

Conclusion: SLM-Bench为SLM评估设立了新标准，填补了资源效率与实际应用之间的空白，通过开源标准化评估协议促进可重复性和进一步研究。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) offer computational efficiency and
accessibility, yet a systematic evaluation of their performance and
environmental impact remains lacking. We introduce SLM-Bench, the first
benchmark specifically designed to assess SLMs across multiple dimensions,
including accuracy, computational efficiency, and sustainability metrics.
SLM-Bench evaluates 15 SLMs on 9 NLP tasks using 23 datasets spanning 14
domains. The evaluation is conducted on 4 hardware configurations, providing a
rigorous comparison of their effectiveness. Unlike prior benchmarks, SLM-Bench
quantifies 11 metrics across correctness, computation, and consumption,
enabling a holistic assessment of efficiency trade-offs. Our evaluation
considers controlled hardware conditions, ensuring fair comparisons across
models. We develop an open-source benchmarking pipeline with standardized
evaluation protocols to facilitate reproducibility and further research. Our
findings highlight the diverse trade-offs among SLMs, where some models excel
in accuracy while others achieve superior energy efficiency. SLM-Bench sets a
new standard for SLM evaluation, bridging the gap between resource efficiency
and real-world applicability.

TL;DR: HebID是首个希伯来语多标签社会身份检测语料库，包含5536个以色列政客Facebook帖子的句子，标注了12种细粒度社会身份，使用希伯来语调优的大语言模型取得了最佳效果（F1=0.74）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有社会身份检测数据集主要针对英语、单标签且使用粗粒度身份类别，缺乏对希伯来语等非英语政治语境中细粒度社会身份的研究。

Method: 构建包含5536个句子的希伯来语多标签语料库，基于调查数据手动标注12种社会身份，比较多标签编码器、单标签编码器和2B-9B参数生成式LLM的性能。

Result: 希伯来语调优的LLM表现最佳（宏观F1=0.74），应用分类器分析政客Facebook帖子和议会演讲，发现身份表达的流行度、时间趋势、聚类模式和性别差异。

Conclusion: HebID为希伯来语社会身份研究提供了全面基础，可作为其他非英语政治语境类似研究的模型，实现了精英话语与公众身份优先级的比较。

Abstract: Political language is deeply intertwined with social identities. While social
identities are often shaped by specific cultural contexts and expressed through
particular uses of language, existing datasets for group and identity detection
are predominantly English-centric, single-label and focus on coarse identity
categories. We introduce HebID, the first multilabel Hebrew corpus for social
identity detection: 5,536 sentences from Israeli politicians' Facebook posts
(Dec 2018-Apr 2021), manually annotated for twelve nuanced social identities
(e.g. Rightist, Ultra-Orthodox, Socially-oriented) grounded by survey data. We
benchmark multilabel and single-label encoders alongside 2B-9B-parameter
generative LLMs, finding that Hebrew-tuned LLMs provide the best results
(macro-$F_1$ = 0.74). We apply our classifier to politicians' Facebook posts
and parliamentary speeches, evaluating differences in popularity, temporal
trends, clustering patterns, and gender-related variations in identity
expression. We utilize identity choices from a national public survey, enabling
a comparison between identities portrayed in elite discourse and the public's
identity priorities. HebID provides a comprehensive foundation for studying
social identities in Hebrew and can serve as a model for similar research in
other non-English political contexts.

TL;DR: Dream 7B是目前最强大的开源扩散大语言模型，采用离散扩散建模并行优化序列，在通用、数学和编程任务上表现优异，具有卓越的规划能力和推理灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决自回归模型顺序生成的局限性，开发并行生成能力更强的扩散语言模型，提供更灵活的推理方式和质量-速度权衡。

Method: 采用离散扩散建模方法，通过迭代去噪并行优化序列。使用自回归LLM初始化和上下文自适应token级噪声重调度等简单有效的训练技术。

Result: 在通用、数学和编程任务上持续超越现有扩散语言模型，展现出优越的规划能力、任意顺序生成、填充能力和可调节的质量-速度权衡。

Conclusion: Dream 7B证明了扩散建模在语言生成任务中的有效性，为基于扩散的语言建模研究提供了新的基准和工具（Dream-Base和Dream-Instruct）。

Abstract: We introduce Dream 7B, the most powerful open diffusion large language model
to date. Unlike autoregressive (AR) models that generate tokens sequentially,
Dream 7B employs discrete diffusion modeling to refine sequences in parallel
through iterative denoising. Our model consistently outperforms existing
diffusion language models on general, mathematical, and coding tasks. Dream 7B
demonstrates superior planning abilities and inference flexibility, including
arbitrary-order generation, infilling capabilities, and tunable quality-speed
trade-offs. These results are achieved through simple yet effective training
techniques, including AR-based LLM initialization and context-adaptive
token-level noise rescheduling. We release both Dream-Base and Dream-Instruct
to facilitate further research in diffusion-based language modeling.

TL;DR: 首个大规模政治去合法化话语(PDD)计算研究，构建希伯来语语料库并开发两阶段分类模型，发现PDD在社交媒体和政治事件中显著上升的趋势


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究政治去合法化话语(PDD)的自动分析可行性，理解民主话语中规范性攻击的模式和趋势

Method: 构建包含10,410句希伯来语语料库，手动标注1,812个PDD实例；开发两阶段分类管道，结合微调编码器模型和解码器LLM

Result: 最佳模型(DictaLM 2.0)在二元PDD检测中F1=0.74，在去合法化特征分类中macro-F1=0.67；发现PDD在过去30年显著上升，社交媒体中更普遍，右倾行为者使用更多

Conclusion: 自动化PDD分析对于理解民主话语具有可行性和重要价值，能够揭示政治话语中的规范性攻击模式

Abstract: We present the first large-scale computational study of political
delegitimization discourse (PDD), defined as symbolic attacks on the normative
validity of political entities. We curate and manually annotate a novel
Hebrew-language corpus of 10,410 sentences drawn from Knesset speeches
(1993-2023), Facebook posts (2018-2021), and leading news outlets, of which
1,812 instances (17.4\%) exhibit PDD and 642 carry additional annotations for
intensity, incivility, target type, and affective framing. We introduce a
two-stage classification pipeline combining finetuned encoder models and
decoder LLMs. Our best model (DictaLM 2.0) attains an F$_1$ of 0.74 for binary
PDD detection and a macro-F$_1$ of 0.67 for classification of delegitimization
characteristics. Applying this classifier to longitudinal and cross-platform
data, we see a marked rise in PDD over three decades, higher prevalence on
social media versus parliamentary debate, greater use by male than female
politicians, and stronger tendencies among right-leaning actors - with
pronounced spikes during election campaigns and major political events. Our
findings demonstrate the feasibility and value of automated PDD analysis for
understanding democratic discourse.

Conclusion: SafetyFlow首次实现了完全自动化的基准构建流程，提供了全面的安全基准，显著提升了LLM安全评估的效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
requirement for reliable safety evaluation to uncover model vulnerabilities. To
this end, numerous LLM safety evaluation benchmarks are proposed. However,
existing benchmarks generally rely on labor-intensive manual curation, which
causes excessive time and resource consumption. They also exhibit significant
redundancy and limited difficulty. To alleviate these problems, we introduce
SafetyFlow, the first agent-flow system designed to automate the construction
of LLM safety benchmarks. SafetyFlow can automatically build a comprehensive
safety benchmark in only four days without any human intervention by
orchestrating seven specialized agents, significantly reducing time and
resource cost. Equipped with versatile tools, the agents of SafetyFlow ensure
process and cost controllability while integrating human expertise into the
automatic pipeline. The final constructed dataset, SafetyFlowBench, contains
23,446 queries with low redundancy and strong discriminative power. Our
contribution includes the first fully automated benchmarking pipeline and a
comprehensive safety benchmark. We evaluate the safety of 49 advanced LLMs on
our dataset and conduct extensive experiments to validate our efficacy and
efficiency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SDGO是一个自判别引导的强化学习框架，利用LLM自身的判别能力作为奖励信号来增强生成安全性，无需额外标注数据或外部模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现LLMs作为判别器识别有害请求的能力远强于作为生成器防御有害请求的能力，存在安全不一致性

Method: 提出SDGO框架，通过强化学习利用模型自身判别能力作为奖励信号，迭代自改进来对齐判别和生成能力

Result: SDGO显著提升模型安全性，在保持通用基准上有用性的同时，对分布外越狱攻击具有鲁棒性能

Conclusion: 通过对齐LLMs的判别和生成能力，SDGO实现了更紧密的能力耦合，仅需少量判别样本即可进一步增强生成能力

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at various natural language processing
tasks but remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks that induce harmful content
generation. In this paper, we reveal a critical safety inconsistency: LLMs can
more effectively identify harmful requests as discriminators than defend
against them as generators. This insight inspires us to explore aligning the
model's inherent discrimination and generation capabilities. To this end, we
propose SDGO (Self-Discrimination-Guided Optimization), a reinforcement
learning framework that leverages the model's own discrimination capabilities
as a reward signal to enhance generation safety through iterative
self-improvement. Our method does not require any additional annotated data or
external models during the training phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SDGO significantly improves model safety compared to both prompt-based and
training-based baselines while maintaining helpfulness on general benchmarks.
By aligning LLMs' discrimination and generation capabilities, SDGO brings
robust performance against out-of-distribution (OOD) jailbreaking attacks. This
alignment achieves tighter coupling between these two capabilities, enabling
the model's generation capability to be further enhanced with only a small
amount of discriminative samples. Our code and datasets are available at
https://github.com/NJUNLP/SDGO.

Method: 构建SurGE基准，包括主题描述、专家撰写综述和引用文献的测试实例，以及百万论文语料库；提出自动化评估框架，从信息覆盖度、引用准确性、结构组织和内容质量四个维度评估。

Result: 对多种基于LLM的方法进行评估，发现即使是先进的自反思框架，综述生成任务仍然极具挑战性。

Conclusion: 综述生成任务复杂度高，需要持续研究，SurGE基准为相关研究提供了标准化评估基础。

Abstract: Scientific survey articles play a vital role in summarizing research
progress, yet their manual creation is becoming increasingly infeasible due to
the rapid growth of academic literature. While large language models (LLMs)
offer promising capabilities for automating this process, progress in this area
is hindered by the absence of standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols.
To address this gap, we introduce SurGE (Survey Generation Evaluation), a new
benchmark for evaluating scientific survey generation in the computer science
domain. SurGE consists of (1) a collection of test instances, each including a
topic description, an expert-written survey, and its full set of cited
references, and (2) a large-scale academic corpus of over one million papers
that serves as the retrieval pool. In addition, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that measures generated surveys across four dimensions:
information coverage, referencing accuracy, structural organization, and
content quality. Our evaluation of diverse LLM-based approaches shows that
survey generation remains highly challenging, even for advanced self-reflection
frameworks. These findings highlight the complexity of the task and the
necessity for continued research. We have open-sourced all the code, data, and
models at: https://github.com/oneal2000/SurGE

TL;DR: Pos2Distill是一个位置到位置的知识蒸馏框架，通过将优势位置的能力转移到劣势位置来缓解长上下文处理中的位置偏差问题，在检索和推理任务中均取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 位置偏差（PB）表现为不同上下文位置敏感度的不均匀性，严重损害长上下文理解和处理能力。现有方法通过修改架构来缓解PB，但显著的PB仍然存在。

Method: 提出Pos2Distill框架，利用位置引起的固有差异来抵消PB本身。针对检索和推理范式设计了两个专门实例：Pos2Distill-R¹和Pos2Distill-R²，通过知识蒸馏将优势位置的能力转移到劣势位置。

Result: 使用Pos2Distill方法在长上下文检索和推理任务中实现了增强的均匀性和显著的性能提升，所有上下文位置都获得改善。两个专门系统展现出强大的跨任务泛化能力。

Conclusion: Pos2Distill通过位置到位置的知识蒸馏有效缓解了位置偏差问题，在长上下文处理任务中取得了优异性能，并展现出良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Positional bias (PB), manifesting as non-uniform sensitivity across different
contextual locations, significantly impairs long-context comprehension and
processing capabilities. While prior work seeks to mitigate PB through
modifying the architectures causing its emergence, significant PB still
persists. To address PB effectively, we introduce \textbf{Pos2Distill}, a
position to position knowledge distillation framework. Pos2Distill transfers
the superior capabilities from advantageous positions to less favorable ones,
thereby reducing the huge performance gaps. The conceptual principle is to
leverage the inherent, position-induced disparity to counteract the PB itself.
We identify distinct manifestations of PB under \textbf{\textsc{r}}etrieval and
\textbf{\textsc{r}}easoning paradigms, thereby designing two specialized
instantiations: \emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{1}} and
\emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{2}} respectively, both grounded in this
core principle. By employing the Pos2Distill approach, we achieve enhanced
uniformity and significant performance gains across all contextual positions in
long-context retrieval and reasoning tasks. Crucially, both specialized systems
exhibit strong cross-task generalization mutually, while achieving superior
performance on their respective tasks.

Motivation: 孜加拉语作为世界第七大语言，因资源稀缺和标注数据集不足而面临数字化不足。词干提取对于这种语法变化丰富的低资源语言至关重要，可以降低算法复杂度。

Method: 论文进行了孜加拉语词干提取方法的综述性调研，分析了现有研究的断层问题和实现缺口，并批判了评估方法。

Result: 研究发现孜加拉语词干提取领域存在显著空白，早期研究与现有工作存在断层，且缺乏可复现的实现。评估指标也不适用于孜加拉语的丰富语法特征。

Conclusion: 论文建议开发更健壮的孜加拉语词干提取器，并建议继续深入研究以提升语言分析和处理能力。

Abstract: Bangla, the seventh most widely spoken language worldwide with 300 million
native speakers, faces digital under-representation due to limited resources
and lack of annotated datasets. Stemming, a critical preprocessing step in
language analysis, is essential for low-resource, highly-inflectional languages
like Bangla, because it can reduce the complexity of algorithms and models by
significantly reducing the number of words the algorithm needs to consider.
This paper conducts a comprehensive survey of stemming approaches, emphasizing
the importance of handling morphological variants effectively. While exploring
the landscape of Bangla stemming, it becomes evident that there is a
significant gap in the existing literature. The paper highlights the
discontinuity from previous research and the scarcity of accessible
implementations for replication. Furthermore, it critiques the evaluation
methodologies, stressing the need for more relevant metrics. In the context of
Bangla's rich morphology and diverse dialects, the paper acknowledges the
challenges it poses. To address these challenges, the paper suggests directions
for Bangla stemmer development. It concludes by advocating for robust Bangla
stemmers and continued research in the field to enhance language analysis and
processing.

Motivation: 电商平台拥有丰富的多模态数据，但现有数据集在规模和设计上有限，难以系统研究图像是否真正增强产品理解能力，以及何时会引入冗余或降低性能

Method: 构建EcomMMMU数据集（406,190样本，8,989,510图像），包含8个核心任务和VSS子集；提出SUMEI方法，通过预测视觉效用来策略性地利用多图像进行下游任务

Result: 分析发现产品图像并不一致提升性能，有时反而会降低表现，表明MLLMs在有效利用丰富视觉内容方面存在困难；SUMEI方法在实验中展现出有效性和鲁棒性

Conclusion: 需要更智能的多图像利用策略，SUMEI方法通过数据驱动的方式有效解决了MLLMs在电商任务中视觉内容利用的挑战，为多模态理解提供了新思路

Abstract: E-commerce platforms are rich in multimodal data, featuring a variety of
images that depict product details. However, this raises an important question:
do these images always enhance product understanding, or can they sometimes
introduce redundancy or degrade performance? Existing datasets are limited in
both scale and design, making it difficult to systematically examine this
question. To this end, we introduce EcomMMMU, an e-commerce multimodal
multitask understanding dataset with 406,190 samples and 8,989,510 images.
EcomMMMU is comprised of multi-image visual-language data designed with 8
essential tasks and a specialized VSS subset to benchmark the capability of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to effectively utilize visual content.
Analysis on EcomMMMU reveals that product images do not consistently improve
performance and can, in some cases, degrade it. This indicates that MLLMs may
struggle to effectively leverage rich visual content for e-commerce tasks.
Building on these insights, we propose SUMEI, a data-driven method that
strategically utilizes multiple images via predicting visual utilities before
using them for downstream tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SUMEI. The data and code are available through
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/submission25.

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis with medical large language models is hindered by
knowledge gaps and hallucinations. Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help,
but their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor
feedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce
Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement
learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for
medical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical
retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge
sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More
crutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its
environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure,
and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from
large-scale data through RL.
  Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework
consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches
across multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves
substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic
baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks
for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and
out-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and
retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the
uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional
implementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight
improvements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight
into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more
reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses. See

Motivation: 虽然链式思维推理提升了LLMs的推理能力，但在精确计算任务中仍存在不足。工具集成推理(TIR)被提出作为解决方案，但其泛化效果和对模型推理行为的改善尚不明确。

Method: 提出了ReasonZoo基准测试，涵盖九个不同的推理类别，并设计了两个新指标：性能感知成本(PAC)和性能-成本曲线下面积(AUC-PCC)来评估推理效率。

Result: 实证评估显示，启用TIR的模型在数学和非数学任务中均优于非TIR模型。TIR提高了推理效率，表现为改进的PAC和AUC-PCC指标，表明减少了过度思考并实现了更简化的推理。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了TIR的领域通用优势及其在提升LLMs复杂推理任务能力方面的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning tasks
through methods like chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they often fall
short in tasks requiring precise computations. Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR)
has emerged as a solution by incorporating external tools into the reasoning
process. Nevertheless, the generalization of TIR in improving the reasoning
ability of LLM is still unclear. Additionally, whether TIR has improved the
model's reasoning behavior and helped the model think remains to be studied. We
introduce ReasonZoo, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing nine diverse
reasoning categories, to evaluate the effectiveness of TIR across various
domains. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics, Performance-Aware Cost
(PAC) and Area Under the Performance-Cost Curve (AUC-PCC), to assess reasoning
efficiency. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that TIR-enabled models
consistently outperform their non-TIR counterparts in both mathematical and
non-mathematical tasks. Furthermore, TIR enhances reasoning efficiency, as
evidenced by improved PAC and AUC-PCC, indicating reduced overthinking and more
streamlined reasoning. These findings underscore the domain-general benefits of
TIR and its potential to advance LLM capabilities in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Tool calling has emerged as a critical capability for AI agents to interact
with the real world and solve complex tasks. While the Model Context Protocol
(MCP) provides a powerful standardized framework for tool integration, there is
a significant gap in benchmarking how well AI agents can effectively solve
multi-step tasks using diverse MCP tools in realistic, dynamic scenarios. In
this work, we present LiveMCP-101, a benchmark of 101 carefully curated
real-world queries, refined through iterative LLM rewriting and manual review,
that require coordinated use of multiple MCP tools including web search, file
operations, mathematical reasoning, and data analysis. Moreover, we introduce a
novel evaluation approach that leverages ground-truth execution plans rather
than raw API outputs, better reflecting the evolving nature of real-world
environments. Experiments show that even frontier LLMs achieve a success rate
below 60\%, highlighting major challenges in tool orchestration. Detailed
ablations and error analysis further reveal distinct failure modes and
inefficiencies in token usage, pointing to concrete directions for advancing
current models. LiveMCP-101 sets a rigorous standard for evaluating real-world
agent capabilities, advancing toward autonomous AI systems that reliably
execute complex tasks through tool use.

Abstract: Facial landmark detection is an important task in computer vision with
numerous applications, such as head pose estimation, expression analysis, face
swapping, etc. Heatmap regression-based methods have been widely used to
achieve state-of-the-art results in this task. These methods involve computing
the argmax over the heatmaps to predict a landmark. Since argmax is not
differentiable, these methods use a differentiable approximation, Soft-argmax,
to enable end-to-end training on deep-nets. In this work, we revisit this
long-standing choice of using Soft-argmax and demonstrate that it is not the
only way to achieve strong performance. Instead, we propose an alternative
training objective based on the classic structured prediction framework.
Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three facial
landmark benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, and 300W), converging 2.2x faster during
training while maintaining better/competitive accuracy. Our code is available

*Mustafa Mohammadi Gharasuie,Luis Rueda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新题的图像分类方法，通过将图卷积神经网络（GCNs）与Voronoi图结合，将图像表示为图结构来提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN方法在处理复杂数据结构时有限，需要更有效地模型图像中的关系数据。

Method: 将图像转换为图结构（像素/区域作为顶点），使用Delaunay三角剖来优化图表示，然后通过GCN-Voronoi结合模型进行分类。

Result: 在多个标准数据集上实现了预处理效率和分类准确性的显著提升，特别是在复杂场景和细粒度分类任务中超越了最先进方法。

Conclusion: 这种GCN与Voronoi图的结合为图像分类提供了新视角，扩展了图基学习在计算机视觉和非结构化数据分析中的应用潜力。

Abstract: The rapid progress in image classification has been largely driven by the
adoption of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which offer a robust framework
for handling complex data structures. This study introduces a novel approach
that integrates GCNs with Voronoi diagrams to enhance image classification by
leveraging their ability to effectively model relational data. Unlike
conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our method represents images
as graphs, where pixels or regions function as vertices. These graphs are then
refined using corresponding Delaunay triangulations, optimizing their
representation. The proposed model achieves significant improvements in both
preprocessing efficiency and classification accuracy across various benchmark
datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in challenging
scenarios involving intricate scenes and fine-grained categories. Experimental
results, validated through cross-validation, underscore the effectiveness of
combining GCNs with Voronoi diagrams for advancing image classification. This
research not only presents a novel perspective on image classification but also
expands the potential applications of graph-based learning paradigms in
computer vision and unstructured data analysis.

*Hakjin Lee,Junghoon Seo,Jaehoon Sim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOPO是一个单阶段、基于查询的框架，将类别级9自由度姿态估计作为2D检测的自然扩展，仅使用RGB图像就实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要一种更简单的、仅使用RGB的替代方案，直接从类别级别学习，统一物体检测和9自由度姿态估计，无需额外数据。

Method: 在transformer检测器基础上增加轻量级姿态头、边界框条件平移模块和6D感知匈牙利匹配成本，端到端训练仅使用RGB图像和类别级姿态标签。

Result: 在REAL275数据集上达到79.6% IoU50和54.1% 10°10cm指标，超越之前所有RGB-only方法，大幅缩小与RGB-D系统的差距。

Conclusion: YOPO证明了单阶段RGB-only方法能够高效统一物体检测和9自由度姿态估计，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Abstract: Accurately recovering the full 9-DoF pose of unseen instances within specific
categories from a single RGB image remains a core challenge for robotics and
automation. Most existing solutions still rely on pseudo-depth, CAD models, or
multi-stage cascades that separate 2D detection from pose estimation. Motivated
by the need for a simpler, RGB-only alternative that learns directly at the
category level, we revisit a longstanding question: Can object detection and
9-DoF pose estimation be unified with high performance, without any additional
data? We show that they can with our method, YOPO, a single-stage, query-based
framework that treats category-level 9-DoF estimation as a natural extension of
2D detection. YOPO augments a transformer detector with a lightweight pose
head, a bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and a 6D-aware Hungarian
matching cost. The model is trained end-to-end only with RGB images and
category-level pose labels. Despite its minimalist design, YOPO sets a new
state of the art on three benchmarks. On the REAL275 dataset, it achieves 79.6%
$\rm{IoU}_{50}$ and 54.1% under the $10^\circ$$10{\rm{cm}}$ metric, surpassing
prior RGB-only methods and closing much of the gap to RGB-D systems. The code,
models, and additional qualitative results can be found on our project.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代人脸识别系统容易受到物理呈现攻击和数字伪造攻击，传统方法使用分离的检测器处理这两种攻击向量，增加了系统复杂性和推理延迟，且无法应对组合攻击。

Method: 使用配对采样对比学习框架，自动匹配真实和攻击自拍照对，学习模态无关的活体检测特征，实现统一的物理和数字攻击检测。

Result: 在第6届人脸反欺骗挑战赛统一物理-数字攻击检测基准上取得了2.10%的平均分类错误率(ACER)，计算量轻量(4.46 GFLOPs)，训练时间不到1小时。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个实用且高效的统一解决方案，能够同时检测物理和数字攻击，适合实际部署应用。

Abstract: Modern face recognition systems remain vulnerable to spoofing attempts,
including both physical presentation attacks and digital forgeries.
Traditionally, these two attack vectors have been handled by separate models,
each targeting its own artifacts and modalities. However, maintaining distinct
detectors increases system complexity and inference latency and leaves systems
exposed to combined attack vectors. We propose the Paired-Sampling Contrastive
Framework, a unified training approach that leverages automatically matched
pairs of genuine and attack selfies to learn modality-agnostic liveness cues.
Evaluated on the 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge Unified Physical-Digital
Attack Detection benchmark, our method achieves an average classification error
rate (ACER) of 2.10 percent, outperforming prior solutions. The framework is
lightweight (4.46 GFLOPs) and trains in under one hour, making it practical for
real-world deployment. Code and pretrained models are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAIGen是一种无需训练的黑盒对抗图像生成方法，通过仅需3-20个采样步骤从无条件扩散模型生成高质量对抗样本，比现有方法快10倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生成模型的对抗攻击通常产生低质量图像且计算资源需求大，扩散模型虽然能生成高质量图像但需要数百个采样步骤。

Method: 通过在混合步骤区间注入扰动，结合选择性RGB通道策略（红色通道使用注意力图，绿色和蓝色通道使用GradCAM引导的扰动），在保持图像结构的同时最大化目标模型的误分类。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，对VGGNet源模型，TAIGen对ResNet成功率为70.6%，对MNASNet为80.8%，对ShuffleNet为97.8%。PSNR均高于30dB，生成速度快10倍。

Conclusion: TAIGen实现了高效高质量的对抗样本生成，具有最低的鲁棒准确率，表明防御机制对其生成的图像净化效果最差，是最具影响力的攻击方法。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks from generative models often produce low-quality images
and require substantial computational resources. Diffusion models, though
capable of high-quality generation, typically need hundreds of sampling steps
for adversarial generation. This paper introduces TAIGen, a training-free
black-box method for efficient adversarial image generation. TAIGen produces
adversarial examples using only 3-20 sampling steps from unconditional
diffusion models. Our key finding is that perturbations injected during the
mixing step interval achieve comparable attack effectiveness without processing
all timesteps. We develop a selective RGB channel strategy that applies
attention maps to the red channel while using GradCAM-guided perturbations on
green and blue channels. This design preserves image structure while maximizing
misclassification in target models. TAIGen maintains visual quality with PSNR
above 30 dB across all tested datasets. On ImageNet with VGGNet as source,
TAIGen achieves 70.6% success against ResNet, 80.8% against MNASNet, and 97.8%
against ShuffleNet. The method generates adversarial examples 10x faster than
existing diffusion-based attacks. Our method achieves the lowest robust
accuracy, indicating it is the most impactful attack as the defense mechanism
is least successful in purifying the images generated by TAIGen.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RUN++是一个可逆展开网络，通过生成式精炼解决隐蔽视觉感知任务，在掩码和RGB域同时应用可逆建模，并使用扩散模型处理不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐蔽视觉感知方法主要局限于掩码域的可逆策略，未能充分利用RGB域的潜力，需要一种能够在两个域同时工作并有效处理不确定性的方法。

Method: 将CVP任务建模为数学优化问题，展开为多阶段深度网络。包含三个模块：CORE模块在掩码域应用可逆建模识别核心对象区域；CARE模块在RGB域扩展该原理以改善前景-背景分离；FINE模块使用定向Bernoulli扩散模型仅精炼分割掩码的不确定区域。

Result: 提出的RUN++方法能够有效减少假阳性和假阴性，在真实世界退化条件下保持鲁棒性，计算效率高于全图像处理过程。

Conclusion: RUN++通过可逆展开网络与生成式精炼的独特协同作用，为构建鲁棒的隐蔽视觉感知系统提供了新范式，可扩展到更广泛的双层优化框架。

Abstract: Existing methods for concealed visual perception (CVP) often leverage
reversible strategies to decrease uncertainty, yet these are typically confined
to the mask domain, leaving the potential of the RGB domain underexplored. To
address this, we propose a reversible unfolding network with generative
refinement, termed RUN++. Specifically, RUN++ first formulates the CVP task as
a mathematical optimization problem and unfolds the iterative solution into a
multi-stage deep network. This approach provides a principled way to apply
reversible modeling across both mask and RGB domains while leveraging a
diffusion model to resolve the resulting uncertainty. Each stage of the network
integrates three purpose-driven modules: a Concealed Object Region Extraction
(CORE) module applies reversible modeling to the mask domain to identify core
object regions; a Context-Aware Region Enhancement (CARE) module extends this
principle to the RGB domain to foster better foreground-background separation;
and a Finetuning Iteration via Noise-based Enhancement (FINE) module provides a
final refinement. The FINE module introduces a targeted Bernoulli diffusion
model that refines only the uncertain regions of the segmentation mask,
harnessing the generative power of diffusion for fine-detail restoration
without the prohibitive computational cost of a full-image process. This unique
synergy, where the unfolding network provides a strong uncertainty prior for
the diffusion model, allows RUN++ to efficiently direct its focus toward
ambiguous areas, significantly mitigating false positives and negatives.
Furthermore, we introduce a new paradigm for building robust CVP systems that
remain effective under real-world degradations and extend this concept into a
broader bi-level optimization framework.

Abstract: Livestock methane emissions represent 32% of human-caused methane production,
making automated monitoring critical for climate mitigation strategies. We
introduce GasTwinFormer, a hybrid vision transformer for real-time methane
emission segmentation and dietary classification in optical gas imaging through
a novel Mix Twin encoder alternating between spatially-reduced global attention

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CurveFlow通过引入曲率正则化来学习非线性轨迹，在文本到图像生成中显著提升了语义一致性和图像质量，超越了现有的线性rectified flow模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的rectified flow模型使用线性轨迹，强制零曲率，这可能导致生成过程经过数据流形的低概率区域，影响生成图像与文本描述的语义对齐。

Method: 提出CurveFlow框架，通过曲率正则化技术惩罚轨迹内在动态的突变，学习平滑的非线性轨迹，直接在流路径中融入曲率指导。

Result: 在MS COCO 2014和2017数据集上的实验显示，CurveFlow在文本到图像生成任务中达到最先进性能，在BLEU、METEOR、ROUGE和CLAIR等语义一致性指标上显著优于标准rectified flow变体和其他非线性基线。

Conclusion: 曲率感知建模显著增强了模型忠实遵循复杂指令的能力，同时保持高图像质量，证明了非线性轨迹在提升语义对齐方面的重要性。

Abstract: Existing rectified flow models are based on linear trajectories between data
and noise distributions. This linearity enforces zero curvature, which can
inadvertently force the image generation process through low-probability
regions of the data manifold. A key question remains underexplored: how does
the curvature of these trajectories correlate with the semantic alignment
between generated images and their corresponding captions, i.e., instructional
compliance? To address this, we introduce CurveFlow, a novel flow matching
framework designed to learn smooth, non-linear trajectories by directly
incorporating curvature guidance into the flow path. Our method features a
robust curvature regularization technique that penalizes abrupt changes in the
trajectory's intrinsic dynamics.Extensive experiments on MS COCO 2014 and 2017
demonstrate that CurveFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in
text-to-image generation, significantly outperforming both standard rectified
flow variants and other non-linear baselines like Rectified Diffusion. The
improvements are especially evident in semantic consistency metrics such as
BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CLAIR. This confirms that our curvature-aware modeling
substantially enhances the model's ability to faithfully follow complex
instructions while simultaneously maintaining high image quality. The code is
made publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无参考图像质量评估方法存在数据集偏差和依赖主观标签的问题，限制了其泛化性能。需要开发不依赖原始参考图像或推理时辅助模态的方法。

Method: 提出分层排序和质量对齐框架，结合排序学习和对比学习。使用高阶排序损失监督质量预测，嵌入距离损失确保特征距离与感知差异一致，以及基于结构化文本提示的对比对齐损失增强表示学习。

Result: HiRQA在合成和真实失真基准测试中表现出最先进的性能，具有很强的泛化能力，能够有效处理镜头光晕、雾霾、运动模糊和低光条件等各种失真。轻量级版本HiRQA-S每张图像推理时间仅3.5ms。

Conclusion: HiRQA提供了一个有效的自监督无参考图像质量评估解决方案，通过创新的分层排序和对齐方法实现了优异的泛化性能和实时部署能力。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in no-reference image quality assessment
(NR-IQA), dataset biases and reliance on subjective labels continue to hinder
their generalization performance. We propose HiRQA, Hierarchical Ranking and
Quality Alignment), a self-supervised, opinion-unaware framework that offers a
hierarchical, quality-aware embedding through a combination of ranking and
contrastive learning. Unlike prior approaches that depend on pristine
references or auxiliary modalities at inference time, HiRQA predicts quality
scores using only the input image. We introduce a novel higher-order ranking
loss that supervises quality predictions through relational ordering across
distortion pairs, along with an embedding distance loss that enforces
consistency between feature distances and perceptual differences. A
training-time contrastive alignment loss, guided by structured textual prompts,
further enhances the learned representation. Trained only on synthetic
distortions, HiRQA generalizes effectively to authentic degradations, as
demonstrated through evaluation on various distortions such as lens flare,
haze, motion blur, and low-light conditions. For real-time deployment, we
introduce \textbf{HiRQA-S}, a lightweight variant with an inference time of
only 3.5 ms per image. Extensive experiments across synthetic and authentic
benchmarks validate HiRQA's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, strong
generalization ability, and scalability.

Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction applications are revolutionizing critical use
cases that require rapid situational-awareness, such as emergency response,
tactical scenarios, and public safety. In many cases, their near-real-time
latency requirements and ad-hoc needs for compute resources necessitate
adoption of `Just-in-time' edge environments where the system is set up on the
fly to support the applications during the mission lifetime. However,
reliability issues can arise from the inherent dynamism and operational
adversities of such edge environments, resulting in spatiotemporally correlated
disruptions that impact the camera operations, which can lead to sustained
degradation of reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
portfolio theory inspired edge resource management strategy for reliable
multi-view 3D reconstruction against possible system disruptions. Our proposed
methodology can guarantee reconstruction quality satisfaction even when the
cameras are prone to spatiotemporally correlated disruptions. The portfolio
theoretic optimization problem is solved using a genetic algorithm that
converges quickly for realistic system settings. Using publicly available and
customized 3D datasets, we demonstrate the proposed camera selection strategy's
benefits in guaranteeing reliable 3D reconstruction against traditional
baseline strategies, under spatiotemporal disruptions.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of global blindness, necessitating
early and accurate diagnosis. While deep learning models have shown promise in
DR detection, their black-box nature often hinders clinical adoption due to a
lack of transparency and interpretability. To address this, we propose XDR-LVLM
(eXplainable Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis with LVLM), a novel framework that
leverages Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) for high-precision DR diagnosis
coupled with natural language-based explanations. XDR-LVLM integrates a
specialized Medical Vision Encoder, an LVLM Core, and employs Multi-task Prompt
Engineering and Multi-stage Fine-tuning to deeply understand pathological
features within fundus images and generate comprehensive diagnostic reports.
These reports explicitly include DR severity grading, identification of key
pathological concepts (e.g., hemorrhages, exudates, microaneurysms), and
detailed explanations linking observed features to the diagnosis. Extensive
experiments on the Diabetic Retinopathy (DDR) dataset demonstrate that XDR-LVLM
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Balanced Accuracy of 84.55% and
an F1 Score of 79.92% for disease diagnosis, and superior results for concept
detection (77.95% BACC, 66.88% F1). Furthermore, human evaluations confirm the
high fluency, accuracy, and clinical utility of the generated explanations,
showcasing XDR-LVLM's ability to bridge the gap between automated diagnosis and
clinical needs by providing robust and interpretable insights.

Conclusion: MeSS方法成功解决了城市网格模型纹理生成的挑战，实现了高质量、风格一致的三维室外场景合成，为虚拟城市应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Mesh models have become increasingly accessible for numerous cities; however,
the lack of realistic textures restricts their application in virtual urban
navigation and autonomous driving. To address this, this paper proposes MeSS
(Meshbased Scene Synthesis) for generating high-quality, styleconsistent
outdoor scenes with city mesh models serving as the geometric prior. While
image and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth
maps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective
views, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion
models excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but
often struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with
rendered control videos. In contrast, image diffusion models, though unable to
guarantee cross-view visual consistency, can produce more geometry-aligned
results when combined with ControlNet. Building on this insight, our approach
enhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The
pipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically
consistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we
propagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and
third, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure)
using the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh
surface. Our method outperforms existing approaches in both geometric alignment
and generation quality. Once synthesized, the scene can be rendered in diverse
styles through relighting and style transfer techniques.

Abstract: Existing approaches in reinforcement learning train an agent to learn desired

agents to cause failure scenarios. We evaluate our adversarial agent against
all the rule based agents and show the decrease in cumulative reward.

Abstract: Accurate morphological quantification of renal pathology functional units
relies on instance-level segmentation, yet most existing datasets and automated
methods provide only binary (semantic) masks, limiting the precision of
downstream analyses. Although classical post-processing techniques such as
watershed, morphological operations, and skeletonization, are often used to
separate semantic masks into instances, their individual effectiveness is
constrained by the diverse morphologies and complex connectivity found in renal
tissue. In this study, we present DyMorph-B2I, a dynamic, morphology-guided
binary-to-instance segmentation pipeline tailored for renal pathology. Our
approach integrates watershed, skeletonization, and morphological operations
within a unified framework, complemented by adaptive geometric refinement and
customizable hyperparameter tuning for each class of functional unit. Through
systematic parameter optimization, DyMorph-B2I robustly separates adherent and
heterogeneous structures present in binary masks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms individual classical approaches and
na\"ive combinations, enabling superior instance separation and facilitating
more accurate morphometric analysis in renal pathology workflows. The pipeline

TL;DR: 本文提出STAGNet模型，通过改进时空特征提取和循环网络聚合，在仅使用行车记录仪视频的情况下提升事故预测性能，在多个数据集上取得了优于现有方法的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ADAS系统多依赖多种传感器，但仅使用行车记录仪视频输入更具成本效益和易部署性。然而这带来了更大的技术挑战，需要改进事故预测能力。

Method: 提出STAGNet模型，整合更好的时空特征并通过循环网络进行聚合，改进现有的图神经网络方法用于行车记录仪视频事故预测。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，STAGNet模型在平均精度和平均碰撞时间值上均优于先前方法，无论是在同一数据集交叉验证还是在不同数据集训练测试时。

Conclusion: STAGNet模型通过改进时空特征提取和聚合机制，为仅使用行车记录仪视频的事故预测提供了更有效的解决方案，具有更好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Accident prediction and timely warnings play a key role in improving road
safety by reducing the risk of injury to road users and minimizing property
damage. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to support human
drivers and are especially useful when they can anticipate potential accidents
before they happen. While many existing systems depend on a range of sensors
such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam video input presents
a more challenging but a more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In
this work, we incorporate better spatio-temporal features and aggregate them
through a recurrent network to improve upon state-of-the-art graph neural
networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three
publicly available datasets show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves
higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous
methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and
tested on different datasets.

*Ziang Cao,Zhaoxi Chen,Liang Pan,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TriMM是首个前馈式3D原生生成模型，通过整合RGB、RGBD和点云等多模态数据，利用协作多模态编码和三平面潜在扩散模型，实现了高质量的3D资产生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D生成模型大多局限于单模态或纯3D结构，无法充分利用多模态数据的互补优势，限制了训练数据集的范围和模型性能。

Method: 1) 引入协作多模态编码整合模态特定特征；2) 采用辅助2D和3D监督提升鲁棒性；3) 基于三平面潜在扩散模型生成高质量3D资产

Result: 在多个知名数据集上的实验表明，TriMM通过有效利用多模态数据，在使用少量训练数据的情况下实现了与大规模数据集训练模型相竞争的性能

Conclusion: TriMM证明了多模态数据在3D生成中的有效性，为整合其他多模态数据集到3D生成中提供了可行性

Abstract: 3D content inherently encompasses multi-modal characteristics and can be
projected into different modalities (e.g., RGB images, RGBD, and point clouds).
Each modality exhibits distinct advantages in 3D asset modeling: RGB images
contain vivid 3D textures, whereas point clouds define fine-grained 3D
geometries. However, most existing 3D-native generative architectures either
operate predominantly within single-modality paradigms-thus overlooking the
complementary benefits of multi-modality data-or restrict themselves to 3D
structures, thereby limiting the scope of available training datasets. To
holistically harness multi-modalities for 3D modeling, we present TriMM, the
first feed-forward 3D-native generative model that learns from basic
multi-modalities (e.g., RGB, RGBD, and point cloud). Specifically, 1) TriMM
first introduces collaborative multi-modal coding, which integrates
modality-specific features while preserving their unique representational
strengths. 2) Furthermore, auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision are introduced to
raise the robustness and performance of multi-modal coding. 3) Based on the
embedded multi-modal code, TriMM employs a triplane latent diffusion model to
generate 3D assets of superior quality, enhancing both the texture and the
geometric detail. Extensive experiments on multiple well-known datasets
demonstrate that TriMM, by effectively leveraging multi-modality, achieves
competitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets, despite
utilizing a small amount of training data. Furthermore, we conduct additional
experiments on recent RGB-D datasets, verifying the feasibility of
incorporating other multi-modal datasets into 3D generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种面向中心的原型对比聚类框架，通过软原型对比模块和双重一致性学习模块解决类间冲突和原型漂移问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比学习方法在聚类任务中存在类间冲突问题，硬原型计算与真实聚类中心存在偏差，需要更有效的原型计算方法

Method: 包含软原型对比模块（使用样本属于聚类中心的概率作为权重计算类别原型）和双重一致性学习模块（对齐相同样本的不同变换和不同样本的邻域）

Result: 在五个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法相比最先进方法具有有效性

Conclusion: 提出的中心导向原型对比聚类框架能够有效解决类间冲突问题，减少原型漂移，提高聚类性能

Abstract: Contrastive learning is widely used in clustering tasks due to its
discriminative representation. However, the conflict problem between classes is
difficult to solve effectively. Existing methods try to solve this problem
through prototype contrast, but there is a deviation between the calculation of
hard prototypes and the true cluster center. To address this problem, we
propose a center-oriented prototype contrastive clustering framework, which
consists of a soft prototype contrastive module and a dual consistency learning
module. In short, the soft prototype contrastive module uses the probability
that the sample belongs to the cluster center as a weight to calculate the
prototype of each category, while avoiding inter-class conflicts and reducing
prototype drift. The dual consistency learning module aligns different
transformations of the same sample and the neighborhoods of different samples
respectively, ensuring that the features have transformation-invariant semantic
information and compact intra-cluster distribution, while providing reliable
guarantees for the calculation of prototypes. Extensive experiments on five
datasets show that the proposed method is effective compared to the SOTA. Our
code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/CPCC.

Method: 提出双高度协同VLN任务(DuAl-VLN)，构建HaL-13k数据集，开发AeroDuo框架：高空机采用多模态大语言模型进行目标推理，低空机采用轻量级多阶段策略进行导航和目标凭图

Result: 创建了包含13,838条协同高低空无人机示范轨迹的数据集，包含未见地图和未见对象验证集，系统评估模型在新环境和新目标上的汇总能力

Conclusion: 通过双无人机协同模式，可以合理利用高空机的广视解析能力和低空机的精确导航能力，只需交换最小化的坐标信息即可实现高效协同，为复杂外部环境的自主导航提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is an emerging task that enables
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to navigate outdoor environments using natural
language instructions and visual cues. However, due to the extended
trajectories and complex maneuverability of UAVs, achieving reliable UAV-VLN
performance is challenging and often requires human intervention or overly
detailed instructions. To harness the advantages of UAVs' high mobility, which
could provide multi-grained perspectives, while maintaining a manageable motion
space for learning, we introduce a novel task called Dual-Altitude UAV
Collaborative VLN (DuAl-VLN). In this task, two UAVs operate at distinct
altitudes: a high-altitude UAV responsible for broad environmental reasoning,
and a low-altitude UAV tasked with precise navigation. To support the training
and evaluation of the DuAl-VLN, we construct the HaL-13k, a dataset comprising
13,838 collaborative high-low UAV demonstration trajectories, each paired with
target-oriented language instructions. This dataset includes both unseen maps
and an unseen object validation set to systematically evaluate the model's
generalization capabilities across novel environments and unfamiliar targets.
To consolidate their complementary strengths, we propose a dual-UAV
collaborative VLN framework, AeroDuo, where the high-altitude UAV integrates a
multimodal large language model (Pilot-LLM) for target reasoning, while the
low-altitude UAV employs a lightweight multi-stage policy for navigation and
target grounding. The two UAVs work collaboratively and only exchange minimal
coordinate information to ensure efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种跳过步采样机制，能够在保持马尔可夫性质的同时显著加速扩散模型的生成过程，无需依赖非马尔可夫过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型需要顺序生成，采样步骤多效率低。虽然DDIM等方法通过非马尔可夫过程减少步骤，但缺乏对原始扩散过程能否实现相同效率的理解。

Method: 提出跳过步采样机制，绕过多个中间去噪步骤，直接从噪声生成图像。该方法基于与标准扩散模型相同的训练目标，证明加速采样是预训练扩散模型的内在属性。

Result: 在OpenAI ADM、Stable Diffusion和Open Sora等流行预训练扩散模型上的实验表明，该方法能以显著减少的采样步骤实现高质量生成。

Conclusion: 跳过步采样是扩散模型的固有特性，可以与DDIM等技术结合进一步提升生成效率，为扩散模型的实际应用提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have been achieving state-of-the-art results across various
generation tasks. However, a notable drawback is their sequential generation
process, requiring long-sequence step-by-step generation. Existing methods,
such as DDIM, attempt to reduce sampling steps by constructing a class of
non-Markovian diffusion processes that maintain the same training objective.
However, there remains a gap in understanding whether the original diffusion
process can achieve the same efficiency without resorting to non-Markovian
processes. In this paper, we provide a confirmative answer and introduce
skipped-step sampling, a mechanism that bypasses multiple intermediate
denoising steps in the iterative generation process, in contrast with the
traditional step-by-step refinement of standard diffusion inference. Crucially,
we demonstrate that this skipped-step sampling mechanism is derived from the
same training objective as the standard diffusion model, indicating that
accelerated sampling via skipped-step sampling via a Markovian way is an
intrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models. Additionally, we propose an
enhanced generation method by integrating our accelerated sampling technique
with DDIM. Extensive experiments on popular pretrained diffusion models,
including the OpenAI ADM, Stable Diffusion, and Open Sora models, show that our
method achieves high-quality generation with significantly reduced sampling
steps.

Motivation: 传统图像编解码器编码模式有限且依赖工程师手动选择，对非专业用户不友好，需要更智能的交互式压缩解决方案。

Method: 提出三个关键创新：1)多功能编码框架统一不同编码模式；2)基于增强上下文学习的交互式编码代理；3)首个专用智能交互图像压缩基准测试IIC-bench。

Conclusion: 该研究为图像压缩中的人工通用智能提供了有前景的发展方向，展示了LLM在专业图像处理任务中的强大潜力。

Abstract: We present Comp-X, the first intelligently interactive image compression
paradigm empowered by the impressive reasoning capability of large language
model (LLM) agent. Notably, commonly used image codecs usually suffer from
limited coding modes and rely on manual mode selection by engineers, making
them unfriendly for unprofessional users. To overcome this, we advance the
evolution of image coding paradigm by introducing three key innovations: (i)
multi-functional coding framework, which unifies different coding modes of
various objective/requirements, including human-machine perception, variable
coding, and spatial bit allocation, into one framework. (ii) interactive coding
agent, where we propose an augmented in-context learning method with coding
expert feedback to teach the LLM agent how to understand the coding request,
mode selection, and the use of the coding tools. (iii) IIC-bench, the first
dedicated benchmark comprising diverse user requests and the corresponding
annotations from coding experts, which is systematically designed for
intelligently interactive image compression evaluation. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed Comp-X can understand the coding requests
efficiently and achieve impressive textual interaction capability. Meanwhile,
it can maintain comparable compression performance even with a single coding
framework, providing a promising avenue for artificial general intelligence
(AGI) in image compression.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in computational pathology aims to identify rare and scarce
anomalies where disease-related data are often limited or missing. Existing
anomaly detection methods, primarily designed for industrial settings, face
limitations in pathology due to computational constraints, diverse tissue
structures, and lack of interpretability. To address these challenges, we

built on a pre-trained vision-language model with a lightweight trainable MLP.
By incorporating both normal and abnormal pathology knowledge, Ano-NAViLa
enhances accuracy and robustness to variability in pathology images and
provides interpretability through image-text associations. Evaluated on two
lymph node datasets from different organs, Ano-NAViLa achieves the
state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection and localization,

TL;DR: RATopo提出了一种冗余分配策略，通过改进Transformer解码器结构实现一对多分配，增强车道拓扑推理的监督效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有车道拓扑推理方法采用先检测后推理的范式，基于一对一分配结果进行监督，导致监督范围有限和性能次优。

Method: 重构Transformer解码器，交换交叉注意力和自注意力层顺序以保留冗余预测；实例化多个并行交叉注意力块以增强车道检测多样性。

Result: 在OpenLane-V2数据集上的大量实验表明，RATopo策略具有模型无关性，能无缝集成到现有拓扑推理框架中，持续提升车道-车道和车道-交通拓扑性能。

Conclusion: RATopo通过冗余分配策略实现了数量丰富和几何多样的拓扑监督，有效解决了现有方法监督范围有限的问题，显著提升了车道拓扑推理性能。

Abstract: Lane topology reasoning plays a critical role in autonomous driving by
modeling the connections among lanes and the topological relationships between
lanes and traffic elements. Most existing methods adopt a
first-detect-then-reason paradigm, where topological relationships are
supervised based on the one-to-one assignment results obtained during the
detection stage. This supervision strategy results in suboptimal topology
reasoning performance due to the limited range of valid supervision. In this
paper, we propose RATopo, a Redundancy Assignment strategy for lane Topology
reasoning that enables quantity-rich and geometry-diverse topology supervision.
Specifically, we restructure the Transformer decoder by swapping the
cross-attention and self-attention layers. This allows redundant lane
predictions to be retained before suppression, enabling effective one-to-many
assignment. We also instantiate multiple parallel cross-attention blocks with
independent parameters, which further enhances the diversity of detected lanes.
Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our RATopo strategy is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing topology
reasoning frameworks, consistently improving both lane-lane and lane-traffic
topology performance.

Motivation: 传统设计专利分析依赖图像数据，但专利草图往往缺乏完整的视觉上下文和语义信息，导致在先技术搜索中存在模糊性。

Method: 利用CLIP模型构建DesignCLIP框架，采用类别感知分类和对比学习，使用生成的详细图像描述和多视图图像学习来处理专利数据的独特特征。

Result: DesignCLIP在专利分类和检索等下游任务中始终优于基线和最先进模型，展示了多模态方法在专利分析中的潜力。

Conclusion: 多模态方法有望推动专利分析的发展，DesignCLIP为设计创新提供了更多样化的灵感来源。

Abstract: In the field of design patent analysis, traditional tasks such as patent
classification and patent image retrieval heavily depend on the image data.
However, patent images -- typically consisting of sketches with abstract and
structural elements of an invention -- often fall short in conveying
comprehensive visual context and semantic information. This inadequacy can lead
to ambiguities in evaluation during prior art searches. Recent advancements in
vision-language models, such as CLIP, offer promising opportunities for more
reliable and accurate AI-driven patent analysis. In this work, we leverage CLIP
models to develop a unified framework DesignCLIP for design patent applications
with a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents. To address the unique
characteristics of patent data, DesignCLIP incorporates class-aware
classification and contrastive learning, utilizing generated detailed captions
for patent images and multi-views image learning. We validate the effectiveness
of DesignCLIP across various downstream tasks, including patent classification
and patent retrieval. Additionally, we explore multimodal patent retrieval,
which provides the potential to enhance creativity and innovation in design by
offering more diverse sources of inspiration. Our experiments show that
DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and SOTA models in the patent
domain on all tasks. Our findings underscore the promise of multimodal
approaches in advancing patent analysis. The codebase is available here:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动化方法在超声视频CHD检测中存在三个主要问题：忽略时间信息、仅限于二元分类、缺乏预测校准，这限制了临床应用的可靠性。

Method: 提出时间提示对齐(TPA)方法，利用基础图像-文本模型和提示感知对比学习，通过图像编码器提取帧特征，可训练时间提取器聚合心脏运动信息，并使用条件变分自编码器风格调制模块量化分类不确定性。

Conclusion: TPA框架成功整合了时间建模、对比学习和不确定性量化，显著提升了胎儿先天性心脏病超声视频分类的性能和临床可靠性。

Abstract: Congenital heart defect (CHD) detection in ultrasound videos is hindered by
image noise and probe positioning variability. While automated methods can
reduce operator dependence, current machine learning approaches often neglect
temporal information, limit themselves to binary classification, and do not
account for prediction calibration. We propose Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA),
a method leveraging foundation image-text model and prompt-aware contrastive
learning to classify fetal CHD on cardiac ultrasound videos. TPA extracts
features from each frame of video subclips using an image encoder, aggregates
them with a trainable temporal extractor to capture heart motion, and aligns
the video representation with class-specific text prompts via a margin-hinge
contrastive loss. To enhance calibration for clinical reliability, we introduce
a Conditional Variational Autoencoder Style Modulation (CVAESM) module, which
learns a latent style vector to modulate embeddings and quantifies
classification uncertainty. Evaluated on a private dataset for CHD detection
and on a large public dataset, EchoNet-Dynamic, for systolic dysfunction, TPA
achieves state-of-the-art macro F1 scores of 85.40% for CHD diagnosis, while
also reducing expected calibration error by 5.38% and adaptive ECE by 6.8%. On
EchoNet-Dynamic's three-class task, it boosts macro F1 by 4.73% (from 53.89% to
58.62%). Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA) is a framework for fetal congenital
heart defect (CHD) classification in ultrasound videos that integrates temporal
modeling, prompt-aware contrastive learning, and uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: LiDAR与摄像头融合的多模态方法能有效解决篮球运动中的实时3D追踪挑战，为体育分析提供新的技术途径

Abstract: Real-time 3D trajectory player tracking in sports plays a crucial role in
tactical analysis, performance evaluation, and enhancing spectator experience.
Traditional systems rely on multi-camera setups, but are constrained by the
inherently two-dimensional nature of video data and the need for complex 3D
reconstruction processing, making real-time analysis challenging. Basketball,
in particular, represents one of the most difficult scenarios in the MOT field,
as ten players move rapidly and complexly within a confined court space, with
frequent occlusions caused by intense physical contact.
  To address these challenges, this paper constructs BasketLiDAR, the first
multimodal dataset in the sports MOT field that combines LiDAR point clouds
with synchronized multi-view camera footage in a professional basketball
environment, and proposes a novel MOT framework that simultaneously achieves
improved tracking accuracy and reduced computational cost. The BasketLiDAR
dataset contains a total of 4,445 frames and 3,105 player IDs, with fully
synchronized IDs between three LiDAR sensors and three multi-view cameras. We
recorded 5-on-5 and 3-on-3 game data from actual professional basketball
players, providing complete 3D positional information and ID annotations for
each player. Based on this dataset, we developed a novel MOT algorithm that
leverages LiDAR's high-precision 3D spatial information. The proposed method
consists of a real-time tracking pipeline using LiDAR alone and a multimodal
tracking pipeline that fuses LiDAR and camera data. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves real-time operation, which was difficult
with conventional camera-only methods, while achieving superior tracking
performance even under occlusion conditions. The dataset is available upon

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有COD方法需要大量训练和计算资源，基础模型如SAM需要高质量提示且难以直接处理COD任务，手动生成提示成本高效率低

Method: 将COD解耦为两个阶段：1）RAG阶段通过无监督聚类构建检索数据库生成粗掩码提示；2）SEG阶段使用SAM2进行精细分割。整个过程无需训练

Result: 在基准COD数据集上达到或超越SOTA方法性能，所有实验在个人笔记本上完成，计算效率高

Conclusion: RAG-SEG提供了一种无需训练的高效COD解决方案，在保持竞争力的同时显著降低了计算需求，具有很好的实用性

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) poses a significant challenge in computer
vision due to the high similarity between objects and their backgrounds.
Existing approaches often rely on heavy training and large computational
resources. While foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
offer strong generalization, they still struggle to handle COD tasks without
fine-tuning and require high-quality prompts to yield good performance.
However, generating such prompts manually is costly and inefficient. To address
these challenges, we propose \textbf{First RAG, Second SEG (RAG-SEG)}, a
training-free paradigm that decouples COD into two stages: Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) for generating coarse masks as prompts, followed by SAM-based
segmentation (SEG) for refinement. RAG-SEG constructs a compact retrieval
database via unsupervised clustering, enabling fast and effective feature
retrieval. During inference, the retrieved features produce pseudo-labels that
guide precise mask generation using SAM2. Our method eliminates the need for
conventional training while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive
experiments on benchmark COD datasets demonstrate that RAG-SEG performs on par
with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Notably, all experiments are
conducted on a \textbf{personal laptop}, highlighting the computational
efficiency and practicality of our approach. We present further analysis in the
Appendix, covering limitations, salient object detection extension, and
possible improvements.

Motivation: 文本到视频扩散模型可能被滥用来生成有害或误导性内容，这些模型通常使用未经授权的个人身份、艺术创作和有害材料进行训练，导致不良内容的不可控生产和传播。

Method: 提出VideoEraser框架，采用两阶段处理：选择性提示嵌入调整（SPEA）和抗干扰噪声引导（ARNG），作为即插即用模块与现有T2V扩散模型无缝集成。

Result: 在物体擦除、艺术风格擦除、名人擦除和显式内容擦除四个任务中，VideoEraser在效果、完整性、保真度、鲁棒性和泛化性方面均优于现有方法，平均减少46%的不良内容生成。

Conclusion: VideoEraser在抑制T2V生成中的不良内容方面达到了最先进的性能，为解决扩散模型的安全和隐私问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models has raised concerns
about privacy, copyright, and safety due to their potential misuse in
generating harmful or misleading content. These models are often trained on
numerous datasets, including unauthorized personal identities, artistic
creations, and harmful materials, which can lead to uncontrolled production and
distribution of such content. To address this, we propose VideoEraser, a
training-free framework that prevents T2V diffusion models from generating
videos with undesirable concepts, even when explicitly prompted with those
concepts. Designed as a plug-and-play module, VideoEraser can seamlessly
integrate with representative T2V diffusion models via a two-stage process:
Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise
Guidance (ARNG). We conduct extensive evaluations across four tasks, including
object erasure, artistic style erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content
erasure. Experimental results show that VideoEraser consistently outperforms
prior methods regarding efficacy, integrity, fidelity, robustness, and
generalizability. Notably, VideoEraser achieves state-of-the-art performance in
suppressing undesirable content during T2V generation, reducing it by 46% on
average across four tasks compared to baselines.

Abstract: The world is constantly moving towards AI based systems and autonomous
vehicles are now reality in different parts of the world. These vehicles
require sensors and cameras to detect objects and maneuver according to that.
It becomes important to for such vehicles to also predict from a distant if a
person is about to cross a road or not. The current study focused on predicting
the intent of crossing the road by pedestrians in an experimental setup. The
study involved working with deep learning models to predict poses and sequence
modelling for temporal predictions. The study analysed three different sequence
modelling to understand the prediction behaviour and it was found out that GRU
was better in predicting the intent compared to LSTM model but 1D CNN was the
best model in terms of speed. The study involved video analysis, and the output
of pose detection model was integrated later on to sequence modelling
techniques for an end-to-end deep learning framework for predicting road
crossing intents.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文通过注意力敲除技术系统分析了视频大语言模型的内部机制，发现视频信息提取主要在早期层完成，形成感知编码和抽象推理的两阶段过程，中间层是关键异常点，且时空建模更多依赖语言引导检索而非视频token自注意力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型研究主要关注性能提升，对其内部机制理解有限。本文旨在通过系统性实证研究填补这一空白，揭示Video-LLMs如何处理和理解视频内容。

Method: 采用注意力敲除作为主要分析工具，设计了三种敲除变体：视频时间敲除、视频空间敲除和语言到视频敲除。通过控制敲除层窗口和类型，提供全局和细粒度两种设置进行分析。

Result: 发现三个关键发现：1）早期层主要负责视频信息提取；2）某些中间层对视频问答有异常大的影响；3）时空建模更依赖语言引导检索而非视频token自注意力。这些见解可用于减少注意力计算。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统揭示Video-LLMs内部处理机制的工作，为未来研究提供了可解释性和效率视角，证明了模型内部机制分析的重要价值。

Abstract: Taking advantage of large-scale data and pretrained language models, Video
Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in answering
video questions. However, most existing efforts focus on improving performance,
with limited attention to understanding their internal mechanisms. This paper
aims to bridge this gap through a systematic empirical study. To interpret
existing VideoLLMs, we adopt attention knockouts as our primary analytical tool
and design three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and
Language-to-Video Knockout. Then, we apply these three knockouts on different
numbers of layers (window of layers). By carefully controlling the window of
layers and types of knockouts, we provide two settings: a global setting and a
fine-grained setting. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) Global setting
indicates Video information extraction primarily occurs in early layers,
forming a clear two-stage process -- lower layers focus on perceptual encoding,
while higher layers handle abstract reasoning; (2) In the fine-grained setting,
certain intermediate layers exert an outsized impact on video question
answering, acting as critical outliers, whereas most other layers contribute
minimally; (3) In both settings, we observe that spatial-temporal modeling
relies more on language-guided retrieval than on intra- and inter-frame
self-attention among video tokens, despite the latter's high computational
cost. Finally, we demonstrate that these insights can be leveraged to reduce
attention computation in Video-LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first work
to systematically uncover how Video-LLMs internally process and understand
video content, offering interpretability and efficiency perspectives for future
research.

*Jacinto Colan,Ana Davila,Yasuhisa Hasegawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BioTune是一种进化自适应微调技术，通过进化算法选择性地微调层来提高迁移学习效率，在多个图像分类数据集上实现了竞争性或改进的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微调方法需要更新所有模型参数，可能导致过拟合和计算成本高。深度学习在图像分析中取得进展，但大型全训练模型的计算需求仍然是一个考虑因素。

Method: BioTune采用进化算法来识别用于微调的聚焦层集合，旨在优化模型在给定目标任务上的性能。通过将微调过程集中在相关层的子集上，减少可训练参数数量。

Result: 在九个不同领域的图像分类数据集上的评估表明，BioTune相比AutoRGN和LoRA等现有微调方法，实现了竞争性或改进的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: BioTune通过选择性层微调减少了计算成本，促进了跨不同数据特征和分布的更高效迁移学习。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown substantial progress in image analysis. However, the
computational demands of large, fully trained models remain a consideration.
Transfer learning offers a strategy for adapting pre-trained models to new
tasks. Traditional fine-tuning often involves updating all model parameters,
which can potentially lead to overfitting and higher computational costs. This
paper introduces BioTune, an evolutionary adaptive fine-tuning technique that
selectively fine-tunes layers to enhance transfer learning efficiency. BioTune
employs an evolutionary algorithm to identify a focused set of layers for
fine-tuning, aiming to optimize model performance on a given target task.
Evaluation across nine image classification datasets from various domains
indicates that BioTune achieves competitive or improved accuracy and efficiency
compared to existing fine-tuning methods such as AutoRGN and LoRA. By
concentrating the fine-tuning process on a subset of relevant layers, BioTune
reduces the number of trainable parameters, potentially leading to decreased
computational cost and facilitating more efficient transfer learning across
diverse data characteristics and distributions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ICGS-Quantizer方法，通过联合利用高斯间和属性间相关性，使用跨场景共享码本，将3D高斯溅射压缩到千字节级别，并支持基于图像的场景更新


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS压缩方法只能压缩到兆字节级别，不适用于大规模场景或场景集合的长期归档，且缺乏对归档后场景变化的适应机制

Method: 提出图像条件高斯溅射量化器，联合利用高斯间和属性间相关性，使用共享码本，编码过程基于解码时捕获的图像进行条件解码

Result: 将3DGS存储需求降低到千字节范围，保持视觉保真度，在压缩效率和场景变化适应性方面优于现有方法

Conclusion: ICGS-Quantizer显著提升了3DGS的压缩效率，实现了千字节级别的压缩，同时提供了对归档后场景变化的适应能力

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted considerable attention for
enabling high-quality real-time rendering. Although 3DGS compression methods
have been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two
limitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to
the megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or
extensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene
changes after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an
Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially
enhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes
after archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly
exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared
codebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to
previously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks.
This approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the
kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to
post-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images
captured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes
are trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized
representations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We
evaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating.
Experimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene
changes. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available on GitHub.

TL;DR: DriveSplat是一种基于神经高斯表示的动态-静态解耦方法，用于驾驶场景的高质量3D重建，通过区域体素初始化、可变形神经高斯和深度/法线先验监督，在Waymo和KITTI数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于3D高斯泼溅的方法在处理驾驶场景时，虽然通过解耦动态和静态组件解决了运动模糊问题，但忽略了具有充分几何关系的背景优化，仅通过添加高斯来拟合每个训练视图，导致新视角渲染鲁棒性有限且缺乏准确的几何表示。

Method: 1) 采用区域体素初始化方案，将场景划分为近、中、远区域以增强近距离细节表示；2) 引入可变形神经高斯来建模非刚性动态对象，其参数通过可学习变形网络进行时间调整；3) 使用预训练模型的深度和法线先验对整个框架进行监督，提高几何结构准确性。

Result: 在Waymo和KITTI数据集上进行了严格评估，证明了在驾驶场景的新视角合成方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DriveSplat通过创新的动态-静态解耦方法和几何先验监督，有效解决了驾驶场景3D重建中的挑战，实现了高质量的新视角渲染和准确的几何表示。

Abstract: In the realm of driving scenarios, the presence of rapidly moving vehicles,
pedestrians in motion, and large-scale static backgrounds poses significant
challenges for 3D scene reconstruction. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian
Splatting address the motion blur problem by decoupling dynamic and static
components within the scene. However, these decoupling strategies overlook
background optimization with adequate geometry relationships and rely solely on
fitting each training view by adding Gaussians. Therefore, these models exhibit
limited robustness in rendering novel views and lack an accurate geometric
representation. To address the above issues, we introduce DriveSplat, a
high-quality reconstruction method for driving scenarios based on neural
Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling. To better accommodate
the predominantly linear motion patterns of driving viewpoints, a region-wise
voxel initialization scheme is employed, which partitions the scene into near,
middle, and far regions to enhance close-range detail representation.
Deformable neural Gaussians are introduced to model non-rigid dynamic actors,
whose parameters are temporally adjusted by a learnable deformation network.
The entire framework is further supervised by depth and normal priors from
pre-trained models, improving the accuracy of geometric structures. Our method
has been rigorously evaluated on the Waymo and KITTI datasets, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios.

TL;DR: 该论文针对深度学习模型在抽象推理方面的瓶颈，通过Raven渐进矩阵问题研究抽象推理能力，提出了因果链建模方法并改进了基线模型DIO。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习模型在抽象推理方面存在根本性瓶颈，Raven渐进矩阵问题被用作评估抽象推理能力的权威基准。论文旨在通过解决RPM问题来提升机器智能的抽象推理能力。

Method: 采用因果链建模视角分析RPM任务的完整因果链，设计了基线模型DIO的网络架构。针对DIO优化目标的局限性，逐步提出了三种改进方法。

Result: 实验发现DIO模型的优化目标（最大化上下文与正确选项之间互信息的变分下界）无法让模型真正获得预定义的人类推理逻辑。

Conclusion: 互信息最大化方法存在局限性，需要新的改进方法来更好地捕捉因果关系和提升抽象推理能力。

Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance of current deep learning models across
various domains, their fundamental bottleneck in abstract reasoning remains
unresolved. To address this challenge, the academic community has introduced
Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) problems as an authoritative benchmark for
evaluating the abstract reasoning capabilities of deep learning algorithms,
with a focus on core intelligence dimensions such as abstract reasoning,
pattern recognition, and complex problem-solving. Therefore, this paper centers
on solving RPM problems, aiming to contribute to enhancing the abstract
reasoning abilities of machine intelligence. Firstly, this paper adopts a
``causal chain modeling'' perspective to systematically analyze the complete
causal chain in RPM tasks: image $\rightarrow$ abstract attributes
$\rightarrow$ progressive attribute patterns $\rightarrow$ pattern consistency
$\rightarrow$ correct answer. Based on this analysis, the network architecture
of the baseline model DIO is designed. However, experiments reveal that the
optimization objective formulated for DIO, namely maximizing the variational
lower bound of mutual information between the context and the correct option,
fails to enable the model to genuinely acquire the predefined human reasoning
logic. This is attributed to two main reasons: the tightness of the lower bound
significantly impacts the effectiveness of mutual information maximization, and
mutual information, as a statistical measure, does not capture the causal
relationship between subjects and objects. To overcome these limitations, this
paper progressively proposes three improvement methods:

Method: 设计基于SNN的关键帧提取器，引入动态聚合图推理器解耦上下文一致性，提出变分推理重建模块处理特征融合中的不确定性和噪声

Result: 在SumMe、TVSum、VideoXum和QFVS等多个数据集上超越现有方法

Conclusion: SpiVG网络通过结合SNN的事件驱动计算和变分推理，有效提升了视频摘要的性能和鲁棒性

Abstract: With the rise of short video content, efficient video summarization
techniques for extracting key information have become crucial. However,
existing methods struggle to capture the global temporal dependencies and
maintain the semantic coherence of video content. Additionally, these methods
are also influenced by noise during multi-channel feature fusion. We propose a
Spiking Variational Graph (SpiVG) Network, which enhances information density
and reduces computational complexity. First, we design a keyframe extractor
based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), leveraging the event-driven computation
mechanism of SNNs to learn keyframe features autonomously. To enable
fine-grained and adaptable reasoning across video frames, we introduce a
Dynamic Aggregation Graph Reasoner, which decouples contextual object
consistency from semantic perspective coherence. We present a Variational
Inference Reconstruction Module to address uncertainty and noise arising during
multi-channel feature fusion. In this module, we employ Evidence Lower Bound
Optimization (ELBO) to capture the latent structure of multi-channel feature
distributions, using posterior distribution regularization to reduce
overfitting. Experimental results show that SpiVG surpasses existing methods
across multiple datasets such as SumMe, TVSum, VideoXum, and QFVS. Our codes
and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/liwrui/SpiVG.

Motivation: MAE作为视觉基础模型的强大预训练技术，但在新数据集上需要大量超参数调优，目前缺乏MAE超参数与下游任务性能关系的理论分析

Method: 通过分析线性MAE学习到的特征，推导掩码比例和补丁大小如何选择捕捉短程和长程空间相关性的特征，并将分析扩展到非线性MAE

Result: MAE表示能够适应数据集中的空间相关性，超越二阶统计量，掩码比例和补丁大小可调控学习特征的空间范围

Conclusion: 研究为MAE超参数选择提供了理论依据，掩码比例和补丁大小可用于控制学习特征的空间相关性范围

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a powerful pretraining technique
for vision foundation models. Despite their effectiveness, they require
extensive hyperparameter tuning (masking ratio, patch size, encoder/decoder
layers) when applied to novel datasets. While prior theoretical works have
analyzed MAEs in terms of their attention patterns and hierarchical latent
variable models, the connection between MAE hyperparameters and performance on
downstream tasks is relatively unexplored. This work investigates how MAEs
learn spatial correlations in the input image. We analytically derive the
features learned by a linear MAE and show that masking ratio and patch size can
be used to select for features that capture short- and long-range spatial
correlations. We extend this analysis to non-linear MAEs to show that MAE
representations adapt to spatial correlations in the dataset, beyond
second-order statistics. Finally, we discuss some insights on how to select MAE
hyper-parameters in practice.

Conclusion: 提出的双向时间信息传播方法有效解决了现有滑动窗口方法的局限性，在红外小目标检测任务中表现出优异的性能和效率。

Abstract: Moving infrared small target detection is broadly adopted in infrared search
and track systems, and has attracted considerable research focus in recent
years. The existing learning-based multi-frame methods mainly aggregate the
information of adjacent frames in a sliding window fashion to assist the
detection of the current frame. However, the sliding-window-based methods do
not consider joint optimization of the entire video clip and ignore the global
temporal information outside the sliding window, resulting in redundant
computation and sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a
Bidirectional temporal information propagation method for moving InfraRed small
target Detection, dubbed BIRD. The bidirectional propagation strategy
simultaneously utilizes local temporal information of adjacent frames and
global temporal information of past and future frames in a recursive fashion.
Specifically, in the forward and backward propagation branches, we first design
a Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module to model local spatio-temporal
dependency between a target frame and its two adjacent frames. Then, a Global
Temporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module is developed to further aggregate the
global propagation feature with the local fusion feature. Finally, the
bidirectional aggregated features are fused and input into the detection head
for detection. In addition, the entire video clip is jointly optimized by the
traditional detection loss and the additional Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF)
loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BIRD method not only
achieves the state-of-the-art performance but also shows a fast inference
speed.

Abstract: Conventional car damage inspection techniques are labor-intensive, manual,
and frequently overlook tiny surface imperfections like microscopic dents.
Machine learning provides an innovative solution to the increasing demand for
quicker and more precise inspection methods. The paper uses the YOLOv8 object
recognition framework to provide a deep learning-based solution for
automatically detecting microscopic surface flaws, notably tiny dents, on car
exteriors. Traditional automotive damage inspection procedures are manual,
time-consuming, and frequently unreliable at detecting tiny flaws. To solve
this, a bespoke dataset containing annotated photos of car surfaces under
various lighting circumstances, angles, and textures was created. To improve
robustness, the YOLOv8m model and its customized variants, YOLOv8m-t4 and
YOLOv8m-t42, were trained employing real-time data augmentation approaches.
Experimental results show that the technique has excellent detection accuracy
and low inference latency, making it suited for real-time applications such as
automated insurance evaluations and automobile inspections. Evaluation
parameters such as mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and
F1-score verified the model's efficacy. With a precision of 0.86, recall of
0.84, and F1-score of 0.85, the YOLOv8m-t42 model outperformed the YOLOv8m-t4
model (precision: 0.81, recall: 0.79, F1-score: 0.80) in identifying
microscopic surface defects. With a little reduced mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.20, the
mAP@0.5 for YOLOv8m-t42 stabilized at 0.60. Furthermore, YOLOv8m-t42's PR curve
area was 0.88, suggesting more consistent performance than YOLOv8m-t4 (0.82).
YOLOv8m-t42 has greater accuracy and is more appropriate for practical dent
detection applications, even though its convergence is slower.

Conclusion: MATR通过有效的序列对齐和自监督预训练，在视频到视频时刻检索任务上取得了显著的性能提升，证明了其在捕获语义相关性和时序依赖性方面的有效性。

Abstract: Video-to-video moment retrieval (Vid2VidMR) is the task of localizing unseen
events or moments in a target video using a query video. This task poses
several challenges, such as the need for semantic frame-level alignment and
modeling complex dependencies between query and target videos. To tackle this
challenging problem, we introduce MATR (Moment Alignment TRansformer), a
transformer-based model designed to capture semantic context as well as the
temporal details necessary for precise moment localization. MATR conditions
target video representations on query video features using dual-stage sequence
alignment that encodes the required correlations and dependencies. These
representations are then used to guide foreground/background classification and
boundary prediction heads, enabling the model to accurately identify moments in
the target video that semantically match with the query video. Additionally, to
provide a strong task-specific initialization for MATR, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training technique that involves training the model to
localize random clips within videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MATR achieves notable performance improvements of 13.1% in R@1 and 8.1% in mIoU
on an absolute scale compared to state-of-the-art methods on the popular
ActivityNet-VRL dataset. Additionally, on our newly proposed dataset,
SportsMoments, MATR shows a 14.7% gain in R@1 and a 14.4% gain in mIoU on an
absolute scale over strong baselines.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable real-time
performance in novel view synthesis, yet its effectiveness relies heavily on
dense multi-view inputs with precisely known camera poses, which are rarely
available in real-world scenarios. When input views become extremely sparse,
the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) method that 3DGS depends on for initialization
fails to accurately reconstruct the 3D geometric structures of scenes,
resulting in degraded rendering quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
SfM-free 3DGS-based method that jointly estimates camera poses and reconstructs
3D scenes from extremely sparse-view inputs. Specifically, instead of SfM, we
propose a dense stereo module to progressively estimates camera pose
information and reconstructs a global dense point cloud for initialization. To
address the inherent problem of information scarcity in extremely sparse-view
settings, we propose a coherent view interpolation module that interpolates
camera poses based on training view pairs and generates viewpoint-consistent
content as additional supervision signals for training. Furthermore, we
introduce multi-scale Laplacian consistent regularization and adaptive
spatial-aware multi-scale geometry regularization to enhance the quality of
geometrical structures and rendered content. Experiments show that our method
significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art 3DGS-based approaches,
achieving a remarkable 2.75dB improvement in PSNR under extremely sparse-view
conditions (using only 2 training views). The images synthesized by our method
exhibit minimal distortion while preserving rich high-frequency details,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LGMSNet是一种新颖的轻量级医学图像分割框架，通过局部和全局双多尺度设计，在计算开销最小的情况下实现最先进性能，并在零样本泛化测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学图像分割中轻量级模型性能与效率的平衡问题，现有模型往往牺牲性能来换取效率，且缺乏全局上下文感知能力，同时忽略了医学成像中相同卷积核下的通道冗余问题。

Method: 采用异构层内核提取局部高频信息并缓解通道冗余，集成稀疏Transformer-卷积混合分支捕获低频全局信息，基于局部和全局双多尺度设计。

Result: 在六个公共数据集上的广泛实验表明，LGMSNet优于现有最先进方法，特别是在四个未见数据集上的零样本泛化测试中保持卓越性能。

Conclusion: LGMSNet在资源有限的医疗场景中具有实际部署潜力，为轻量级医学图像分割提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a pivotal role in disease diagnosis and
treatment planning, particularly in resource-constrained clinical settings
where lightweight and generalizable models are urgently needed. However,
existing lightweight models often compromise performance for efficiency and
rarely adopt computationally expensive attention mechanisms, severely
restricting their global contextual perception capabilities. Additionally,
current architectures neglect the channel redundancy issue under the same
convolutional kernels in medical imaging, which hinders effective feature
extraction. To address these challenges, we propose LGMSNet, a novel
lightweight framework based on local and global dual multiscale that achieves
state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead. LGMSNet
employs heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to extract local high-frequency
information while mitigating channel redundancy. In addition, the model
integrates sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to capture
low-frequency global information. Extensive experiments across six public
datasets demonstrate LGMSNet's superiority over existing state-of-the-art
methods. In particular, LGMSNet maintains exceptional performance in zero-shot
generalization tests on four unseen datasets, underscoring its potential for
real-world deployment in resource-limited medical scenarios. The whole project
code is in https://github.com/cq-dong/LGMSNet.

TL;DR: MExECON是一个从稀疏多视角RGB图像重建穿衣人体3D模型的新方法，通过多视角联合优化提升了几何和姿态估计精度，无需重新训练网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单视角方法ECON在多视角场景下存在局限性，需要利用多视角信息来提升3D人体重建的几何精度和细节表现。

Method: 提出JMBO算法联合优化SMPL-X人体模型，确保多视角一致性；通过法线图集成从前后面视角捕捉细节；无需重新训练网络。

Result: 实验结果显示MExECON相比单视角基线在保真度上持续提升，与现代少样本3D重建方法相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: MExECON成功扩展了单视角方法到多视角场景，通过多视角联合优化显著提升了3D人体重建的质量和细节表现。

Abstract: This work presents MExECON, a novel pipeline for 3D reconstruction of clothed
human avatars from sparse multi-view RGB images. Building on the single-view
method ECON, MExECON extends its capabilities to leverage multiple viewpoints,
improving geometry and body pose estimation. At the core of the pipeline is the
proposed Joint Multi-view Body Optimization (JMBO) algorithm, which fits a
single SMPL-X body model jointly across all input views, enforcing multi-view
consistency. The optimized body model serves as a low-frequency prior that
guides the subsequent surface reconstruction, where geometric details are added
via normal map integration. MExECON integrates normal maps from both front and
back views to accurately capture fine-grained surface details such as clothing
folds and hairstyles. All multi-view gains are achieved without requiring any
network re-training. Experimental results show that MExECON consistently
improves fidelity over the single-view baseline and achieves competitive
performance compared to modern few-shot 3D reconstruction methods.

TL;DR: AdaSFFuse是一个新颖的多模态图像融合框架，通过自适应跨域协同融合学习实现任务通用性，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升融合性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态图像融合方法面临模态不对齐、高频细节破坏和任务特定限制等挑战，需要一种能够适应不同场景和任务的通用融合框架。

Method: 提出AdaSFFuse框架，包含自适应近似小波变换(AdaWAT)进行频率解耦，以及空间-频率Mamba块进行高效多模态融合，实现跨域协同学习。

Result: 在红外-可见光、多焦点、多曝光和医学图像融合四个任务上的实验表明，AdaSFFuse具有优越的融合性能，同时保持低计算成本和紧凑网络结构。

Conclusion: AdaSFFuse通过自适应频率分离和跨域融合机制，有效解决了多模态图像融合中的关键挑战，在性能和效率之间实现了良好平衡，为多模态图像融合提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate complementary information
from different imaging modalities to overcome the limitations of individual
sensors. It enhances image quality and facilitates downstream applications such
as remote sensing, medical diagnostics, and robotics. Despite significant
advancements, current MMIF methods still face challenges such as modality
misalignment, high-frequency detail destruction, and task-specific limitations.
To address these challenges, we propose AdaSFFuse, a novel framework for
task-generalized MMIF through adaptive cross-domain co-fusion learning.
AdaSFFuse introduces two key innovations: the Adaptive Approximate Wavelet
Transform (AdaWAT) for frequency decoupling, and the Spatial-Frequency Mamba
Blocks for efficient multimodal fusion. AdaWAT adaptively separates the high-
and low-frequency components of multimodal images from different scenes,
enabling fine-grained extraction and alignment of distinct frequency
characteristics for each modality. The Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks
facilitate cross-domain fusion in both spatial and frequency domains, enhancing
this process. These blocks dynamically adjust through learnable mappings to
ensure robust fusion across diverse modalities. By combining these components,
AdaSFFuse improves the alignment and integration of multimodal features,
reduces frequency loss, and preserves critical details. Extensive experiments
on four MMIF tasks -- Infrared-Visible Image Fusion (IVF), Multi-Focus Image
Fusion (MFF), Multi-Exposure Image Fusion (MEF), and Medical Image Fusion (MIF)
-- demonstrate AdaSFFuse's superior fusion performance, ensuring both low
computational cost and a compact network, offering a strong balance between
performance and efficiency. The code will be publicly available at
https://github.com/Zhen-yu-Liu/AdaSFFuse.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法利用生成先验作为伪真值，但往往导致几何一致性差和渲染过度平滑的问题，需要一种能够同时保持几何准确性和视觉质量的解决方案。

Method: 提出ExtraGS框架，包含基于混合高斯-SDF设计的Road Surface Gaussian表示、使用可学习缩放因子的Far Field Gaussians处理远距离物体，以及基于球谐函数的自监督不确定性估计框架来选择性地集成生成先验。

Result: 在多个数据集、多样化多相机设置和各种生成先验上的广泛实验表明，ExtraGS显著提升了外推视图的真实性和几何一致性，同时在原始轨迹上保持高保真度。

Conclusion: ExtraGS通过整合几何和生成先验的创新方法，有效解决了自动驾驶场景外推视图合成中的关键挑战，为模拟驾驶场景提供了高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Synthesizing extrapolated views from recorded driving logs is critical for
simulating driving scenes for autonomous driving vehicles, yet it remains a
challenging task. Recent methods leverage generative priors as pseudo ground
truth, but often lead to poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed
renderings. To address these limitations, we propose ExtraGS, a holistic
framework for trajectory extrapolation that integrates both geometric and
generative priors. At the core of ExtraGS is a novel Road Surface Gaussian(RSG)
representation based on a hybrid Gaussian-Signed Distance Function (SDF)
design, and Far Field Gaussians (FFG) that use learnable scaling factors to
efficiently handle distant objects. Furthermore, we develop a self-supervised
uncertainty estimation framework based on spherical harmonics that enables
selective integration of generative priors only where extrapolation artifacts
occur. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, diverse multi-camera setups,
and various generative priors demonstrate that ExtraGS significantly enhances
the realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views, while preserving
high fidelity along the original trajectory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理多对象交互和复杂运动时存在局限，要么仅限于单对象情况，要么存在时间不一致性和泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：运动初始化和运动细化。第一阶段交互式分割语义组并定义关键帧，通过插值生成粗略动画；第二阶段使用基于组的位移网络(GDN)预测组特定位移场，并利用文本到视频模型的先验知识，还包含上下文条件特征增强(CCFE)等专门模块。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在生成复杂多对象草图的高质量、时间一致动画方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GroupSketch方法扩展了草图动画的实际应用范围，为处理多对象交互和复杂运动提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce GroupSketch, a novel method for vector sketch animation that
effectively handles multi-object interactions and complex motions. Existing
approaches struggle with these scenarios, either being limited to single-object
cases or suffering from temporal inconsistency and poor generalization. To
address these limitations, our method adopts a two-stage pipeline comprising
Motion Initialization and Motion Refinement. In the first stage, the input
sketch is interactively divided into semantic groups and key frames are
defined, enabling the generation of a coarse animation via interpolation. In
the second stage, we propose a Group-based Displacement Network (GDN), which
refines the coarse animation by predicting group-specific displacement fields,
leveraging priors from a text-to-video model. GDN further incorporates
specialized modules, such as Context-conditioned Feature Enhancement (CCFE), to
improve temporal consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality,
temporally consistent animations for complex, multi-object sketches, thus
expanding the practical applications of sketch animation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D3FNet是一个针对高分辨率遥感影像中狭窄道路提取的深度学习网络，通过差分注意力扩张提取、双流解码融合机制和多尺度扩张策略，有效解决了狭窄道路宽度有限、拓扑结构破碎和遮挡等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率遥感影像中的狭窄道路提取面临宽度有限、拓扑结构破碎和频繁遮挡等挑战，传统模型容易过度拟合通用道路宽度，无法有效处理细粒度、遮挡和低对比度的道路段。

Method: 基于D-LinkNet编码器-解码器架构，提出三个关键创新：1）差分注意力扩张提取模块增强细微道路特征并抑制背景噪声；2）双流解码融合机制整合原始特征和注意力调制特征；3）多尺度扩张策略（1,3,5,9）减少网格伪影并改善连续性。

Result: 在DeepGlobe和CHN6-CUG基准测试上的实验表明，D3FNet在具有挑战性的道路区域实现了优越的IoU和召回率，超越了最先进的基线方法。消融研究验证了注意力引导编码和双路径解码的互补协同作用。

Conclusion: D3FNet被证实为复杂遥感和协同感知场景中细粒度狭窄道路提取的鲁棒解决方案，特别适用于处理细粒度、遮挡和低对比度的道路段。

Abstract: Extracting narrow roads from high-resolution remote sensing imagery remains a
significant challenge due to their limited width, fragmented topology, and
frequent occlusions. To address these issues, we propose D3FNet, a Dilated
Dual-Stream Differential Attention Fusion Network designed for fine-grained
road structure segmentation in remote perception systems. Built upon the
encoder-decoder backbone of D-LinkNet, D3FNet introduces three key
innovations:(1) a Differential Attention Dilation Extraction (DADE) module that
enhances subtle road features while suppressing background noise at the
bottleneck; (2) a Dual-stream Decoding Fusion Mechanism (DDFM) that integrates
original and attention-modulated features to balance spatial precision with
semantic context; and (3) a multi-scale dilation strategy (rates 1, 3, 5, 9)
that mitigates gridding artifacts and improves continuity in narrow road
prediction. Unlike conventional models that overfit to generic road widths,
D3FNet specifically targets fine-grained, occluded, and low-contrast road
segments. Extensive experiments on the DeepGlobe and CHN6-CUG benchmarks show
that D3FNet achieves superior IoU and recall on challenging road regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies further verify the
complementary synergy of attention-guided encoding and dual-path decoding.
These results confirm D3FNet as a robust solution for fine-grained narrow road
extraction in complex remote and cooperative perception scenarios.

TL;DR: ADAPT是一种无需反向传播的测试时自适应方法，通过高斯概率推理建模类别条件似然，利用CLIP先验和历史知识库进行轻量级正则化，在多种分布偏移下实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法存在两个主要问题：1）依赖反向传播或迭代优化，限制了可扩展性和实时部署；2）缺乏对类别条件特征分布的显式建模，导致决策边界不可靠和预测校准不足。

Method: 将测试时自适应重新构建为高斯概率推理任务，使用逐渐更新的类别均值和共享协方差矩阵建模类别条件似然，实现闭式、无训练推理。通过CLIP先验和历史知识库进行轻量级正则化来纠正可能的似然偏差。

Result: 在多样化基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法在广泛的分布偏移范围内实现了最先进的性能，具有优越的可扩展性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ADAPT方法无需源数据、梯度更新或完整访问目标数据，支持在线和转导设置，为测试时自适应提供了高效且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under
distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite
notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability.
First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which
limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit
modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial
for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it
remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at
test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and
backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian
probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using
gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables
closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we
introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical
knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full
access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings.
Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts
with superior scalability and robustness.

TL;DR: 提出两阶段训练策略解决INR的频谱偏差问题，通过邻域感知软掩码优先关注高频细节，再过渡到全图像训练，有效提升重建质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式神经表示(INR)存在频谱偏差问题，神经网络倾向于学习低频分量而难以捕捉高频细节如锐利边缘和精细纹理

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：第一阶段使用邻域感知软掩码自适应地为局部变化强烈的像素分配更高权重，鼓励模型早期关注精细细节；第二阶段进行全图像训练

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能持续改善重建质量，并与现有INR方法形成互补

Conclusion: 作为首个在图像INR中为像素分配频率感知重要性的尝试，为缓解频谱偏差问题提供了新途径

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful alternative
to traditional pixel-based formats by modeling images as continuous functions
over spatial coordinates. A key challenge, however, lies in the spectral bias
of neural networks, which tend to favor low-frequency components while
struggling to capture high-frequency (HF) details such as sharp edges and fine
textures. While prior approaches have addressed this limitation through
architectural modifications or specialized activation functions, we propose an
orthogonal direction by directly guiding the training process. Specifically, we
introduce a two-stage training strategy where a neighbor-aware soft mask
adaptively assigns higher weights to pixels with strong local variations,
encouraging early focus on fine details. The model then transitions to
full-image training. Experimental results show that our approach consistently
improves reconstruction quality and complements existing INR methods. As a
pioneering attempt to assign frequency-aware importance to pixels in image INR,
our work offers a new avenue for mitigating the spectral bias problem.

Motivation: 虽然截断最小二乘（TLS）法能够承受95%的离群点，但现有的全局最优法（如SDP松憐）需要数百秒时间，计算成本过高。

Method: 提出了新的线性时间凸杰放板方法和缩结器方法，与分支定界（BnB）算法结合使用，以加快求解速度。

Result: 在提供旋转轴的情况下，新方法能在半秒内完成100个点的3D点云注册全局最优解求，比当前最好的SDP求解器STRIDE快两个数量级。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提供了全局最优性的形式证明，还通过对抗性实例验证了其在局部极小值接近全局最优解时的性能。

Abstract: Recent results showed that point cloud registration with given
correspondences can be made robust to outlier rates of up to 95\% using the
truncated least squares (TLS) formulation. However, solving this combinatorial
optimization problem to global optimality is challenging. Provably globally
optimal approaches using semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations take
hundreds of seconds for 100 points. In this paper, we propose a novel linear
time convex relaxation as well as a contractor method to speed up Branch and
Bound (BnB). Our solver can register two 3D point clouds with 100 points to
provable global optimality in less than half a second when the axis of rotation
is provided. Although it currently cannot solve the full 6DoF problem, it is
two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art SDP solver STRIDE when
solving the rotation-only TLS problem. In addition to providing a formal proof
for global optimality, we present empirical evidence of global optimality using
adversarial instances with local minimas close to the global minimum.

Abstract: Wildlife and human activities are key components of landscape systems.
Understanding their spatial distribution is essential for evaluating human
wildlife interactions and informing effective conservation planning.
Multiperspective monitoring of wildlife and human activities by combining
camera traps and drone imagery. Capturing the spatial patterns of their
distributions, which allows the identification of the overlap of their activity
zones and the assessment of the degree of human wildlife conflict. The study
was conducted in Chitwan National Park (CNP), Nepal, and adjacent regions.
Images collected by visible and nearinfrared camera traps and thermal infrared
drones from February to July 2022 were processed to create training and testing
datasets, which were used to build deep learning models to automatic identify
wildlife and human activities. Drone collected thermal imagery was used for
detecting targets to provide a multiple monitoring perspective. Spatial pattern
analysis was performed to identify animal and resident activity hotspots and
delineation potential human wildlife conflict zones. Among the deep learning
models tested, YOLOv11s achieved the highest performance with a precision of
96.2%, recall of 92.3%, mAP50 of 96.7%, and mAP50 of 81.3%, making it the most
effective for detecting objects in camera trap imagery. Drone based thermal
imagery, analyzed with an enhanced Faster RCNN model, added a complementary
aerial viewpoint for camera trap detections. Spatial pattern analysis
identified clear hotspots for both wildlife and human activities and their
overlapping patterns within certain areas in the CNP and buffer zones
indicating potential conflict. This study reveals human wildlife conflicts
within the conserved landscape. Integrating multiperspective monitoring with
automated object detection enhances wildlife surveillance and landscape
management.

Motivation: 现有视频LLM在整体推理方面取得显著进展，但在时间感知上仍显粗糙：时间戳仅隐式编码、帧级特征连续性捕捉能力弱、语言视觉对齐容易偏离关注实体。

Method: 1) 扩散时序潜在编码器增强边界敏感性和保持时间一致性；2) 对象接地表示显式绑定查询实体到局部视觉证据；3) 混合令牌方案提供显式时间戳建模

Conclusion: Grounded VideoDiT通过三个关键创新设计，成功克服了现有视频LLM在时间感知精度上的局限性，为细粒度时间推理提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Understanding videos requires more than answering open ended questions, it
demands the ability to pinpoint when events occur and how entities interact
across time. While recent Video LLMs have achieved remarkable progress in
holistic reasoning, they remain coarse in temporal perception: timestamps are
encoded only implicitly, frame level features are weak in capturing continuity,
and language vision alignment often drifts from the entities of interest. In
this paper, we present Grounded VideoDiT, a Video LLM designed to overcome
these limitations by introducing three key innovations. First, a Diffusion
Temporal Latent (DTL) encoder enhances boundary sensitivity and maintains
temporal consistency. Second, object grounded representations explicitly bind
query entities to localized visual evidence, strengthening alignment. Third, a
mixed token scheme with discrete temporal tokens provides explicit timestamp
modeling, enabling fine grained temporal reasoning. Together, these designs
equip Grounded VideoDiT with robust grounding capabilities, as validated by
state of the art results on Charades STA, NExT GQA, and multiple VideoQA
benchmarks.

Result: 实例识别准确率提升34%，显著减少非树木实例预测

Conclusion: 方法在密林区域表现良好，但在疏林小树和复杂环境中仍面临挑战

Abstract: Tree instance segmentation of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data is of utmost
importance for forest monitoring, but remains challenging due to variations in
the data caused by factors such as sensor resolution, vegetation state at
acquisition time, terrain characteristics, etc. Moreover, obtaining a
sufficient amount of precisely labeled data to train fully supervised instance
segmentation methods is expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a
weakly supervised approach where labels of an initial segmentation result
obtained either by a non-finetuned model or a closed form algorithm are
provided as a quality rating by a human operator. The labels produced during
the quality assessment are then used to train a rating model, whose task is to
classify a segmentation output into the same classes as specified by the human
operator. Finally, the segmentation model is finetuned using feedback from the
rating model. This in turn improves the original segmentation model by 34\% in
terms of correctly identified tree instances while considerably reducing the
number of non-tree instances predicted. Challenges still remain in data over
sparsely forested regions characterized by small trees (less than two meters in
height) or within complex surroundings containing shrubs, boulders, etc. which
can be confused as trees where the performance of the proposed method is
reduced.

Result: 在ModelNet40和ScanObjectNN基准数据集上的大量实验表明，CFG方法大幅优于最先进的攻击方法

Conclusion: CFG方法通过关键特征引导有效提升了对抗点云的迁移性，为黑盒攻击提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Deep neural networks for 3D point clouds have been demonstrated to be
vulnerable to adversarial examples. Previous 3D adversarial attack methods
often exploit certain information about the target models, such as model
parameters or outputs, to generate adversarial point clouds. However, in
realistic scenarios, it is challenging to obtain any information about the
target models under conditions of absolute security. Therefore, we focus on
transfer-based attacks, where generating adversarial point clouds does not
require any information about the target models. Based on our observation that
the critical features used for point cloud classification are consistent across
different DNN architectures, we propose CFG, a novel transfer-based black-box
attack method that improves the transferability of adversarial point clouds via
the proposed Critical Feature Guidance. Specifically, our method regularizes
the search of adversarial point clouds by computing the importance of the
extracted features, prioritizing the corruption of critical features that are
likely to be adopted by diverse architectures. Further, we explicitly constrain
the maximum deviation extent of the generated adversarial point clouds in the
loss function to ensure their imperceptibility. Extensive experiments conducted
on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
proposed CFG outperforms the state-of-the-art attack methods by a large margin.

Conclusion: MapKD框架成功实现了从多模态到纯视觉的知识转移，为自动驾驶系统提供了高效、低成本的在线地图构建方案

Abstract: Online HD map construction is a fundamental task in autonomous driving
systems, aiming to acquire semantic information of map elements around the ego
vehicle based on real-time sensor inputs. Recently, several approaches have
achieved promising results by incorporating offline priors such as SD maps and
HD maps or by fusing multi-modal data. However, these methods depend on stale
offline maps and multi-modal sensor suites, resulting in avoidable
computational overhead at inference. To address these limitations, we employ a
knowledge distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from multimodal models
with prior knowledge to an efficient, low-cost, and vision-centric student
model. Specifically, we propose MapKD, a novel multi-level cross-modal
knowledge distillation framework with an innovative Teacher-Coach-Student (TCS)
paradigm. This framework consists of: (1) a camera-LiDAR fusion model with
SD/HD map priors serving as the teacher; (2) a vision-centric coach model with
prior knowledge and simulated LiDAR to bridge the cross-modal knowledge
transfer gap; and (3) a lightweight vision-based student model. Additionally,
we introduce two targeted knowledge distillation strategies: Token-Guided 2D
Patch Distillation (TGPD) for bird's eye view feature alignment and Masked
Semantic Response Distillation (MSRD) for semantic learning guidance. Extensive
experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapKD improves
the student model by +6.68 mIoU and +10.94 mAP while simultaneously
accelerating inference speed. The code is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CM2LoD3方法，利用冲突映射从射线到模型先验分析重建LoD3建筑模型，通过语义分割真实和合成冲突映射，结合纹理模型分割提升重建精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoD1和LoD2建筑模型缺乏详细立面元素，LoD3模型虽能解决此问题但传统需要手动建模，难以大规模应用，需要自动化重建方法

Method: 使用冲突映射(CMs)进行射线到模型先验分析，开发语义冲突映射生成器(SCMG)生成合成CMs，结合纹理模型分割并通过置信度分数融合

Result: 实验结果显示方法能有效分割和重建建筑开口，通过不确定性感知的纹理分割融合达到61%的性能

Conclusion: 该方法推进了自动化LoD3模型重建，为可扩展和高效的三维城市建模铺平了道路

Abstract: Detailed 3D building models are crucial for urban planning, digital twins,
and disaster management applications. While Level of Detail 1 (LoD)1 and LoD2
building models are widely available, they lack detailed facade elements
essential for advanced urban analysis. In contrast, LoD3 models address this
limitation by incorporating facade elements such as windows, doors, and
underpasses. However, their generation has traditionally required manual
modeling, making large-scale adoption challenging. In this contribution,
CM2LoD3, we present a novel method for reconstructing LoD3 building models
leveraging Conflict Maps (CMs) obtained from ray-to-model-prior analysis.
Unlike previous works, we concentrate on semantically segmenting real-world CMs
with synthetically generated CMs from our developed Semantic Conflict Map
Generator (SCMG). We also observe that additional segmentation of textured
models can be fused with CMs using confidence scores to further increase
segmentation performance and thus increase 3D reconstruction accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CM2LoD3 method in
segmenting and reconstructing building openings, with the 61% performance with
uncertainty-aware fusion of segmented building textures. This research
contributes to the advancement of automated LoD3 model reconstruction, paving
the way for scalable and efficient 3D city modeling. Our project is available:

TL;DR: 提出了MDPR框架，通过多维度动态提示路由来解决VLM在类别不平衡场景下微调的偏差问题，在多个长尾基准测试中达到SOTA水平


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型(VLMs)在类别不平衡场景下微调时存在偏差，现有方法忽略了VLMs预训练中固有的类别不平衡问题，导致下游任务中的偏差累积

Method: 构建包含五个视觉-语义维度的综合知识库，通过动态路由机制对齐全局视觉类别、检索最优提示、平衡细粒度语义，并通过logits融合获得稳定预测

Result: 在CIFAR-LT、ImageNet-LT和Places-LT等长尾基准测试中取得了与当前SOTA方法相当的结果，动态路由计算开销极小

Conclusion: MDPR为数据不平衡下的VLM微调提供了一个灵活高效的增强方案，语义库对尾部类别特别有效

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
impressive capability in visual tasks, but their fine-tuning often suffers from
bias in class-imbalanced scene. Recent works have introduced large language
models (LLMs) to enhance VLM fine-tuning with supplementing semantic
information. However, they often overlook inherent class imbalance in VLMs'
pre-training, which may lead to bias accumulation in downstream tasks. To
address this problem, this paper proposes a Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt
Routing (MDPR) framework. MDPR constructs a comprehensive knowledge base for
classes, spanning five visual-semantic dimensions. During fine-tuning, the
dynamic routing mechanism aligns global visual classes, retrieves optimal
prompts, and balances fine-grained semantics, yielding stable predictions
through logits fusion. Extensive experiments on long-tailed benchmarks,
including CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, and Places-LT, demonstrate that MDPR achieves
comparable results with current SOTA methods. Ablation studies further confirm
the effectiveness of our semantic library for tail classes, and show that our
dynamic routing incurs minimal computational overhead, making MDPR a flexible
and efficient enhancement for VLM fine-tuning under data imbalance.

TL;DR: StreamMem是一种查询无关的KV缓存内存机制，用于流式视频理解，通过注意力分数压缩视觉token和通用查询token之间的KV缓存，在内存受限的长视频场景中实现高效问答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言推理方面取得显著进展，但处理长视频时效率有限。现有视觉压缩方法需要提前编码整个视觉上下文或预先获取问题，这在长视频理解和多轮对话场景中不实用。

Method: 提出StreamMem，以流式方式编码新视频帧，使用视觉token和通用查询token之间的注意力分数压缩KV缓存，同时维持固定大小的KV内存。

Result: 在三个长视频理解和两个流式视频问答基准测试中，StreamMem在查询无关KV缓存压缩方面达到最先进性能，与查询感知压缩方法相竞争。

Conclusion: StreamMem为内存受限的长视频场景提供了一种高效的查询无关KV缓存压缩解决方案，在保持性能的同时显著降低了内存和计算开销。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
visual-language reasoning, but their ability to efficiently handle long videos
remains limited. Despite recent advances in long-context MLLMs, storing and
attending to the key-value (KV) cache for long visual contexts incurs
substantial memory and computational overhead. Existing visual compression
methods require either encoding the entire visual context before compression or
having access to the questions in advance, which is impractical for long video
understanding and multi-turn conversational settings. In this work, we propose
StreamMem, a query-agnostic KV cache memory mechanism for streaming video
understanding. Specifically, StreamMem encodes new video frames in a streaming
manner, compressing the KV cache using attention scores between visual tokens
and generic query tokens, while maintaining a fixed-size KV memory to enable
efficient question answering (QA) in memory-constrained, long-video scenarios.
Evaluation on three long video understanding and two streaming video question
answering benchmarks shows that StreamMem achieves state-of-the-art performance
in query-agnostic KV cache compression and is competitive with query-aware
compression approaches.

Motivation: 当前生成视频建模方法主要依赖RGB信号，导致在长序列中对象结构和运动出现累积错误，需要解决长视频生成中的结构和时间一致性问题。

Method: 提出WorldWeaver框架，联合预测感知条件和颜色信息，利用深度线索构建记忆库保存上下文信息，采用分段噪声调度训练预测组。

Result: 在基于扩散和整流流的模型上进行广泛实验，证明WorldWeaver能有效减少时间漂移并提高生成视频的保真度。

Conclusion: WorldWeaver通过统一的长期建模方案，显著提升了长视频生成的时间一致性和质量，为解决长序列视频生成中的漂移问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generative video modeling has made significant strides, yet ensuring
structural and temporal consistency over long sequences remains a challenge.
Current methods predominantly rely on RGB signals, leading to accumulated
errors in object structure and motion over extended durations. To address these
issues, we introduce WorldWeaver, a robust framework for long video generation
that jointly models RGB frames and perceptual conditions within a unified
long-horizon modeling scheme. Our training framework offers three key
advantages. First, by jointly predicting perceptual conditions and color
information from a unified representation, it significantly enhances temporal
consistency and motion dynamics. Second, by leveraging depth cues, which we
observe to be more resistant to drift than RGB, we construct a memory bank that
preserves clearer contextual information, improving quality in long-horizon
video generation. Third, we employ segmented noise scheduling for training
prediction groups, which further mitigates drift and reduces computational
cost. Extensive experiments on both diffusion- and rectified flow-based models
demonstrate the effectiveness of WorldWeaver in reducing temporal drift and
improving the fidelity of generated videos.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅减轻标注负担，还将精确生物医学图像分析扩展到资源有限环境，推动医学诊断和病理图像分析自动化

Abstract: Purpose: Recent developments in computational pathology have been driven by
advances in Vision Foundation Models, particularly the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). This model facilitates nuclei segmentation through two primary methods:
prompt-based zero-shot segmentation and the use of cell-specific SAM models for
direct segmentation. These approaches enable effective segmentation across a
range of nuclei and cells. However, general vision foundation models often face
challenges with fine-grained semantic segmentation, such as identifying
specific nuclei subtypes or particular cells. Approach: In this paper, we
propose the molecular-empowered All-in-SAM Model to advance computational
pathology by leveraging the capabilities of vision foundation models. This
model incorporates a full-stack approach, focusing on: (1) annotation-engaging
lay annotators through molecular-empowered learning to reduce the need for
detailed pixel-level annotations, (2) learning-adapting the SAM model to
emphasize specific semantics, which utilizes its strong generalizability with
SAM adapter, and (3) refinement-enhancing segmentation accuracy by integrating
Molecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL). Results: Experimental results
from both in-house and public datasets show that the All-in-SAM model
significantly improves cell classification performance, even when faced with
varying annotation quality. Conclusions: Our approach not only reduces the
workload for annotators but also extends the accessibility of precise
biomedical image analysis to resource-limited settings, thereby advancing
medical diagnostics and automating pathology image analysis.

TL;DR: ATLAS是一个高保真人体模型，通过解耦形状和骨骼基础，从60万高分辨率扫描中学习，显著提升了人体网格建模的准确性和表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数化人体模型在捕捉多样化姿态和形状细节方面存在局限，主要由于训练数据多样性不足和建模假设限制，且内部骨骼与外部软组织存在依赖关系。

Method: 使用240个同步相机捕获的60万高分辨率扫描数据，显式解耦形状和骨骼基础，将网格表示基于人体骨骼，实现非线性姿态校正。

Result: ATLAS在拟合未见过的多样化姿态主体时更准确，定量评估显示非线性姿态校正比线性模型更有效捕捉复杂姿态。

Conclusion: 该方法通过骨骼基础的解耦实现了增强的形状表达能力、细粒度身体属性定制以及独立于软组织特征的关键点拟合，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Parametric body models offer expressive 3D representation of humans across a
wide range of poses, shapes, and facial expressions, typically derived by
learning a basis over registered 3D meshes. However, existing human mesh
modeling approaches struggle to capture detailed variations across diverse body
poses and shapes, largely due to limited training data diversity and
restrictive modeling assumptions. Moreover, the common paradigm first optimizes
the external body surface using a linear basis, then regresses internal
skeletal joints from surface vertices. This approach introduces problematic
dependencies between internal skeleton and outer soft tissue, limiting direct
control over body height and bone lengths. To address these issues, we present
ATLAS, a high-fidelity body model learned from 600k high-resolution scans
captured using 240 synchronized cameras. Unlike previous methods, we explicitly
decouple the shape and skeleton bases by grounding our mesh representation in
the human skeleton. This decoupling enables enhanced shape expressivity,
fine-grained customization of body attributes, and keypoint fitting independent
of external soft-tissue characteristics. ATLAS outperforms existing methods by
fitting unseen subjects in diverse poses more accurately, and quantitative
evaluations show that our non-linear pose correctives more effectively capture
complex poses compared to linear models.

Abstract: 3D content generation has recently attracted significant research interest
due to its applications in VR/AR and embodied AI. In this work, we address the
challenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene
image. Concretely, our contributions are fourfold: (i) we present SceneGen, a
novel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as
input, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture.
Notably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval;
(ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and
global scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature
extraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of
3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass;
(iii) we demonstrate SceneGen's direct extensibility to multi-image input
scenarios. Despite being trained solely on single-image inputs, our
architectural design enables improved generation performance with multi-image
inputs; and (iv) extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the
efficiency and robust generation abilities of our approach. We believe this
paradigm offers a novel solution for high-quality 3D content generation,
potentially advancing its practical applications in downstream tasks. The code

Conclusion: VAREdit在编辑遵循度和效率方面都取得了显著进步，证明了自回归模型在精确图像编辑任务中的优势，为指令引导的图像编辑提供了新的有效范式。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have brought remarkable visual fidelity
to instruction-guided image editing. However, their global denoising process
inherently entangles the edited region with the entire image context, leading
to unintended spurious modifications and compromised adherence to editing
instructions. In contrast, autoregressive models offer a distinct paradigm by
formulating image synthesis as a sequential process over discrete visual
tokens. Their causal and compositional mechanism naturally circumvents the
adherence challenges of diffusion-based methods. In this paper, we present
VAREdit, a visual autoregressive (VAR) framework that reframes image editing as
a next-scale prediction problem. Conditioned on source image features and text
instructions, VAREdit generates multi-scale target features to achieve precise
edits. A core challenge in this paradigm is how to effectively condition the
source image tokens. We observe that finest-scale source features cannot
effectively guide the prediction of coarser target features. To bridge this
gap, we introduce a Scale-Aligned Reference (SAR) module, which injects
scale-matched conditioning information into the first self-attention layer.
VAREdit demonstrates significant advancements in both editing adherence and
efficiency. On standard benchmarks, it outperforms leading diffusion-based
methods by 30\%+ higher GPT-Balance score. Moreover, it completes a
$512\times512$ editing in 1.2 seconds, making it 2.2$\times$ faster than the
similarly sized UltraEdit. The models are available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的组推理方法，通过将组推理建模为二次整数分配问题，在保证样本质量的同时最大化组内多样性，解决了生成模型中独立采样导致的冗余问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生成模型独立采样导致输出冗余，限制了用户选择和创意探索。实际应用中用户通常需要一组多样化且高质量的样本，而非单一最优结果。

Method: 将组推理建模为二次整数分配问题：候选输出作为图节点，通过优化样本质量（一元项）和最大化组多样性（二元项）来选择子集。采用渐进式候选集剪枝提高运行效率。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著提升了组多样性和质量，优于独立采样基线和近期推理算法，适用于文本到图像、图像到图像、图像提示和视频生成等多种任务。

Conclusion: 该框架使生成模型能够将多个输出视为连贯的组而非独立样本，为实际应用提供了更有效的多样化输出生成方案。

Abstract: Generative models typically sample outputs independently, and recent
inference-time guidance and scaling algorithms focus on improving the quality
of individual samples. However, in real-world applications, users are often
presented with a set of multiple images (e.g., 4-8) for each prompt, where
independent sampling tends to lead to redundant results, limiting user choices
and hindering idea exploration. In this work, we introduce a scalable group
inference method that improves both the diversity and quality of a group of
samples. We formulate group inference as a quadratic integer assignment
problem: candidate outputs are modeled as graph nodes, and a subset is selected
to optimize sample quality (unary term) while maximizing group diversity
(binary term). To substantially improve runtime efficiency, we progressively
prune the candidate set using intermediate predictions, allowing our method to
scale up to large candidate sets. Extensive experiments show that our method
significantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent
sampling baselines and recent inference algorithms. Our framework generalizes
across a wide range of tasks, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image
prompting, and video generation, enabling generative models to treat multiple
outputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples.

Conclusion: CineScale成功解决了高分辨率视觉生成中的重复模式问题，显著提升了生成质量，为高分辨率视觉内容生成提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Visual diffusion models achieve remarkable progress, yet they are typically
trained at limited resolutions due to the lack of high-resolution data and
constrained computation resources, hampering their ability to generate
high-fidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Recent efforts have
explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential
higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these
methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive
patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency
information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training
resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the
accumulated errors. In this work, we propose CineScale, a novel inference
paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation. To tackle the various
issues introduced by the two types of video generation architectures, we
propose dedicated variants tailored to each. Unlike existing baseline methods
that are confined to high-resolution T2I and T2V generation, CineScale broadens
the scope by enabling high-resolution I2V and V2V synthesis, built atop
state-of-the-art open-source video generation frameworks. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of
higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models.
Remarkably, our approach enables 8k image generation without any fine-tuning,
and achieves 4k video generation with only minimal LoRA fine-tuning. Generated

Conclusion: 该框架能够分析详细的手术伤口特征并提供后续指导，为个性化伤口护理、及时干预和改善患者预后铺平道路

Abstract: Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common and costly
healthcare-associated infections and and surgical wound care remains a
significant clinical challenge in preventing SSIs and improving patient
outcomes. While recent studies have explored the use of deep learning for
preliminary surgical wound screening, progress has been hindered by concerns
over data privacy and the high costs associated with expert annotation.
Currently, no publicly available dataset or benchmark encompasses various types
of surgical wounds, resulting in the absence of an open-source Surgical-Wound
screening tool. To address this gap: (1) we present SurgWound, the first
open-source dataset featuring a diverse array of surgical wound types. It
contains 697 surgical wound images annotated by 3 professional surgeons with
eight fine-grained clinical attributes. (2) Based on SurgWound, we introduce
the first benchmark for surgical wound diagnosis, which includes visual
question answering (VQA) and report generation tasks to comprehensively
evaluate model performance. (3) Furthermore, we propose a three-stage learning
framework, WoundQwen, for surgical wound diagnosis. In the first stage, we
employ five independent MLLMs to accurately predict specific surgical wound
characteristics. In the second stage, these predictions serve as additional
knowledge inputs to two MLLMs responsible for diagnosing outcomes, which assess
infection risk and guide subsequent interventions. In the third stage, we train
a MLLM that integrates the diagnostic results from the previous two stages to
produce a comprehensive report. This three-stage framework can analyze detailed
surgical wound characteristics and provide subsequent instructions to patients
based on surgical images, paving the way for personalized wound care, timely
intervention, and improved patient outcomes.
