### [1] [Social Bias in Multilingual Language Models: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20201)
*Lance Calvin Lim Gamboa,Yue Feng,Mark Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文对多语言预训练模型中的社会偏见研究进行了系统性综述，分析了偏见评估和缓解方法在多语言和非英语语境中的扩展应用，指出了当前研究在语言多样性、文化意识和评估方法方面的不足，并提出了未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练多语言模型在处理非英语文本时表现出与英语模型相似的社会偏见，但目前缺乏对多语言偏见研究的系统性分析。本文旨在填补这一空白，评估现有研究在跨语言和文化背景下的偏见处理方法。

Method: 采用系统性文献综述方法，分析多语言偏见研究在语言多样性、文化意识、评估指标和缓解技术选择等方面的特点，识别主流方法论设计中的差距和常见问题。

Result: 研究发现当前多语言偏见研究存在语言偏好性（偏向某些语言）、多语言缓解实验稀缺等问题，同时记录了跨语言和文化适应偏见基准测试中的常见问题和解决方案。

Conclusion: 基于研究发现，本文提出了未来研究方向，旨在增强多语言偏见研究的包容性、跨文化适当性，并与最先进的NLP进展保持同步。

Abstract: Pretrained multilingual models exhibit the same social bias as models
processing English texts. This systematic review analyzes emerging research
that extends bias evaluation and mitigation approaches into multilingual and
non-English contexts. We examine these studies with respect to linguistic
diversity, cultural awareness, and their choice of evaluation metrics and
mitigation techniques. Our survey illuminates gaps in the field's dominant
methodological design choices (e.g., preference for certain languages, scarcity
of multilingual mitigation experiments) while cataloging common issues
encountered and solutions implemented in adapting bias benchmarks across
languages and cultures. Drawing from the implications of our findings, we chart
directions for future research that can reinforce the multilingual bias
literature's inclusivity, cross-cultural appropriateness, and alignment with
state-of-the-art NLP advancements.

*Mohammad Amini,Babak Ahmadi,Xiaomeng Xiong,Yilin Zhang,Christopher Qiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探索使用语言模型自动生成形态学评估的多项选择题，通过结构化提示策略和微调技术提升中等规模模型的性能，为K-12教育提供可扩展的评估项目开发方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低人工测试开发成本和不一致性，探索在有限数据条件下使用语言模型自动生成高质量评估项目的可行性。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：比较微调的中等模型(Gemma 2B)与未调优的大模型(GPT-3.5 175B)；评估7种结构化提示策略，包括零样本、少样本、思维链、基于角色、顺序等组合方式。使用自动化指标和专家评分进行评估，并利用GPT-4.1模拟大规模人工评分。

Result: 结构化提示策略（特别是思维链与顺序设计组合）显著提升Gemma的输出质量。Gemma生成的题目比GPT-3.5的零样本响应更符合构念且教学上更合适，提示设计对中等规模模型性能起关键作用。

Conclusion: 结构化提示和高效微调可在有限数据条件下增强中等规模模型的自动生成能力。结合自动化指标、专家判断和大模型模拟的方法能有效确保评估目标的一致性，为K-12语言评估项目开发提供实用且可扩展的工作流程。

Abstract: This study explores automatic generation (AIG) using language models to
create multiple choice questions (MCQs) for morphological assessment, aiming to
reduce the cost and inconsistency of manual test development. The study used a
two-fold approach. First, we compared a fine-tuned medium model (Gemma, 2B)
with a larger untuned one (GPT-3.5, 175B). Second, we evaluated seven
structured prompting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot,
chain-of-thought, role-based, sequential, and combinations. Generated items
were assessed using automated metrics and expert scoring across five
dimensions. We also used GPT-4.1, trained on expert-rated samples, to simulate
human scoring at scale. Results show that structured prompting, especially
strategies combining chain-of-thought and sequential design, significantly
improved Gemma's outputs. Gemma generally produced more construct-aligned and
instructionally appropriate items than GPT-3.5's zero-shot responses, with
prompt design playing a key role in mid-size model performance. This study
demonstrates that structured prompting and efficient fine-tuning can enhance
midsized models for AIG under limited data conditions. We highlight the value
of combining automated metrics, expert judgment, and large-model simulation to
ensure alignment with assessment goals. The proposed workflow offers a
practical and scalable way to develop and validate language assessment items
for K-12.

### [3] [Integrating SystemC TLM into FMI 3.0 Co-Simulations with an Open-Source Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20223)
*Andrei Mihai Albu,Giovanni Pollo,Alessio Burrello,Daniele Jahier Pagliari,Cristian Tesconi,Alessandra Neri,Dario Soldi,Fabio Autieri,Sara Vinco*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种开源方法，将SystemC TLM模型集成到FMI基于协同模拟工作流中，解决多域模拟集成挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 汽车等计算机物理系统复杂度增加，需要有效的多域协同模拟技术。SystemC TLM虽然支持硬件/软件协设计，但与其他工程域模型的互操性有限，导致集成困难

Method: 通过将SystemC TLM组件封装为FMI 3.0协同模拟功能模块(FMU)，开发轻量级开源工具链，解决时间同步和数据交换等关键技术挑战

Result: 通过代表性案例研究证明了该集成方法的可行性和有效性，实现了异构模拟环境之间的无缝标准化集成

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种实用的开源解决方案，有助于提升多域系统模拟的集成效率和互操性能力

Abstract: The growing complexity of cyber-physical systems, particularly in automotive
applications, has increased the demand for efficient modeling and cross-domain
co-simulation techniques. While SystemC Transaction-Level Modeling (TLM)
enables effective hardware/software co-design, its limited interoperability
with models from other engineering domains poses integration challenges. This
paper presents a fully open-source methodology for integrating SystemC TLM
models into Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI)-based co-simulation workflows.
By encapsulating SystemC TLM components as FMI 3.0 Co Simulation Functional
Mock-up Units (FMUs), the proposed approach facilitates seamless, standardized
integration across heterogeneous simulation environments. We introduce a
lightweight open-source toolchain, address key technical challenges such as
time synchronization and data exchange, and demonstrate the feasibility and
effectiveness of the integration through representative case studies.

### [4] [Can Compact Language Models Search Like Agents? Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization for Preserving Agentic RAG Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20324)
*Rikuto Kotoge,Mai Nishimura,Jiaxin Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DGPO通过教师演示的冷启动初始化和持续教师指导，解决了小语言模型在强化学习训练中的稀疏奖励和不稳定问题，使紧凑模型能够实现复杂的智能搜索行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 紧凑语言模型（如0.5B参数）由于推理能力差，在强化学习中面临稀疏奖励和不稳定训练的问题，限制了智能RAG行为的发展。

Method: 提出蒸馏引导策略优化（DGPO），包括从教师演示的冷启动初始化和策略优化期间的持续教师指导。

Result: DGPO使紧凑模型能够实现复杂的智能搜索行为，在某些情况下甚至优于更大的教师模型，并引入了细粒度的ARC评估指标。

Conclusion: DGPO使得在计算资源受限的环境中实现智能RAG成为可能，为紧凑模型的智能行为发展提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a post-training approach to elicit
agentic RAG behaviors such as search and planning from language models.
However, compact language models (e.g., 0.5B parameters) struggle due to poor
reasoning ability, resulting in sparse rewards and unstable training. To
overcome these difficulties, we propose Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization
(DGPO), which addresses the challenges through cold-start initialization from
teacher demonstrations and continuous teacher guidance during policy
optimization. To systematically evaluate our approach, we introduce Agentic RAG
Capabilities (ARC), a fine-grained metric analyzing reasoning, search
coordination, and response synthesis. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that DGPO enables compact models to achieve sophisticated agentic search
behaviors, even outperforming the larger teacher model in some cases. DGPO
makes agentic RAG feasible in computing resource-constrained environments.

### [5] [GUARD: Guideline Upholding Test through Adaptive Role-play and Jailbreak Diagnostics for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20325)
*Haibo Jin,Ruoxi Chen,Peiyan Zhang,Andy Zhou,Yang Zhang,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GUARD是一个测试框架，将政府AI伦理指南转化为可操作的测试问题，通过自动生成违反指南的问题来评估LLM合规性，并引入越狱诊断来识别潜在安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在各领域的广泛应用，其可能生成有害内容引发了社会担忧。政府发布的伦理指南缺乏具体测试方法，需要将高层指南转化为可操作的测试问题。

Method: GUARD方法：1）基于政府指南自动生成违反指南的测试问题；2）对不直接违反指南的响应，引入GUARD-JD越狱诊断，创建场景诱发不道德响应；3）生成合规报告。

Result: 在7个LLM（Vicuna-13B、LongChat-7B、Llama2-7B、Llama-3-8B、GPT-3.5、GPT-4、GPT-4o、Claude-3.7）上验证有效性，测试了三个政府指南的合规性，并能将越狱诊断扩展到视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: GUARD提供了一种系统化测试LLM合规性的方法，能够有效识别指南违反情况和安全机制绕过漏洞，促进可靠LLM应用的发展。

Abstract: As Large Language Models become increasingly integral to various domains,
their potential to generate harmful responses has prompted significant societal
and regulatory concerns. In response, governments have issued ethics guidelines
to promote the development of trustworthy AI. However, these guidelines are
typically high-level demands for developers and testers, leaving a gap in
translating them into actionable testing questions to verify LLM compliance.
  To address this challenge, we introduce GUARD (\textbf{G}uideline
\textbf{U}pholding Test through \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}ole-play and
Jailbreak \textbf{D}iagnostics), a testing method designed to operationalize
guidelines into specific guideline-violating questions that assess LLM
adherence. To implement this, GUARD uses automated generation of
guideline-violating questions based on government-issued guidelines, thereby
testing whether responses comply with these guidelines. When responses directly
violate guidelines, GUARD reports inconsistencies. Furthermore, for responses
that do not directly violate guidelines, GUARD integrates the concept of
``jailbreaks'' to diagnostics, named GUARD-JD, which creates scenarios that
provoke unethical or guideline-violating responses, effectively identifying
potential scenarios that could bypass built-in safety mechanisms. Our method
finally culminates in a compliance report, delineating the extent of adherence
and highlighting any violations.
  We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on seven LLMs,
including Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, Llama2-7B, Llama-3-8B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4,
GPT-4o, and Claude-3.7, by testing compliance under three government-issued
guidelines and conducting jailbreak diagnostics. Additionally, GUARD-JD can
transfer jailbreak diagnostics to vision-language models, demonstrating its
usage in promoting reliable LLM-based applications.

### [6] [Joint Enhancement of Relational Reasoning for Long-Context LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20351)
*Zhirui Chen,Wei Shen,Jiashui Huang,Ling Shao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: JERR是一个基于图推理的框架，通过摘要提取、图构建和关系推理三个组件，提升大语言模型的长文本理解能力，在ROUGE和F1指标上优于所有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在处理长上下文时面临内存限制和复杂推理任务的困难，同时缺乏透明度且容易产生幻觉，需要新的解决方案来提升长文本理解能力。

Method: JERR框架包含三个关键组件：1）策略性分块提取摘要；2）构建有向无环图解决冗余问题；3）使用蒙特卡洛树搜索导航复杂推理路径，确保输出的准确性和可解释性。

Result: 实验结果表明JERR在ROUGE和F1指标上 consistently优于所有基线方法，在LLM-Rater评估中获得最高分数。

Conclusion: JERR提供了一个新颖的解决方案，使大语言模型能够以更高的可靠性和透明度处理扩展上下文和复杂推理任务。

Abstract: Despite significant progress, large language models (LLMs) still struggle
with long contexts due to memory limitations and their inability to tackle
complex and long-context tasks. Additionally, LLMs often suffer from a lack of
transparency and are prone to producing hallucinations. To address these
challenges, we propose \textbf{JERR}, a novel framework designed to enhance
long-context comprehension via graph-based reasoning in LLMs. JERR integrates
three key components: synopsis extraction, graph construction, and relational
reasoning. First, synopsis is extracted by chunking text strategically,
allowing the model to summarize and understand information more efficiently.
Second, we build a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to resolve redundancy, ensuring
logical consistency and clarity. Finally, we incorporate Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to help the model navigate complex reasoning paths, ensuring more
accurate and interpretable outputs. This framework provides a novel solution
that enables LLMs to handle extended contexts and complex reasoning tasks with
improved reliability and transparency. Experimental results show that JERR
consistently outperforms all baselines on the ROUGE and F1 metrics, achieving
the highest scores on the LLM-Rater evaluation.

### [7] [Graph-R1: Unleashing LLM Reasoning with NP-Hard Graph Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20373)
*Yuyao Wang,Bowen Liu,Jianheng Tang,Nuo Chen,Yuhan Li,Qifan Zhang,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出使用NP难图论问题作为合成训练资源，通过两阶段后训练框架（SFT+RL）提升LLM的长链式思维能力，Graph-R1-7B模型在多个领域表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决依赖人工精检高质量数据集的问题，寻找可扩展的合成训练资源来发展LLM的长链式思维能力

Method: 使用NP难图论问题作为合成训练资源，采用两阶段后训练：1）基于拒绝采样NPH图实例的长CoT监督精细调整；2）使用细粒度奖励设计的强化学习

Result: Graph-R1-7B模型在数学、编程、STEM和逻辑领域都显示出强大的沿用性，并在NPH图论问题上超过QwQ-32B的准确性和思维效率

Conclusion: NP难图论问题是一种有效且可扩展的资源，为LLM后训练开启了新的前沿，能够提升长链式思维能力

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress on complex reasoning tasks, largely enabled by their long
chain-of-thought (Long CoT) capabilities. However, developing these Long CoT
behaviors relies heavily on post-training with high-quality datasets, which are
typically costly and human-curated (e.g., mathematics and code), leaving
scalable alternatives unexplored. In this work, we introduce NP-hard (NPH)
graph problems as a novel synthetic training corpus, as they inherently require
deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and reflective strategies, which are
core characteristics of Long CoT reasoning. Building on this insight, we
develop a two-stage post-training framework: (i) Long CoT Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on rejection-sampled NPH graph instances, which substantially
enhances reasoning depth, and (ii) Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a
fine-grained reward design, which sharpens reasoning efficiency. Our flagship
model, Graph-R1-7B, demonstrates strong generalization across mathematics,
coding, STEM, and logic, and surpasses QwQ-32B on NPH graph problems in both
accuracy and reasoning efficiency. These results position NPH graph problems as
an effective and scalable resource for advancing Long CoT reasoning in LLMs,
opening a new frontier for LLM post-training. Our implementation is available
at https://github.com/Graph-Reasoner/Graph-R1, with models and datasets hosted
in our Hugging Face collection HKUST-DSAIL/Graph-R1.

### [8] [CAPE: Context-Aware Personality Evaluation Framework for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20385)
*Jivnesh Sandhan,Fei Cheng,Tushar Sandhan,Yugo Murawaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个上下文感知的人格评估框架CAPE，通过引入对话历史来评估LLM的行为特质，发现上下文增强了响应一致性但也导致人格偏移，不同模型对上下文依赖程度不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心理测量测试采用无上下文方法评估LLM，忽略了真实对话中历史对话对响应的影响，需要开发上下文感知的评估框架。

Method: 提出CAPE框架，引入对话历史作为上下文，设计新指标量化LLM响应一致性，在7个LLM上进行实验分析。

Result: 对话历史通过上下文学习增强响应一致性，但导致人格偏移；GPT模型对问题顺序稳健，Gemini和Llama敏感；GPT响应源于内在人格特质和先前交互，而Gemini和Llama严重依赖先前交互。

Conclusion: 上下文依赖的人格偏移能提高响应一致性并更好符合人类判断，为LLM行为评估提供了更真实的框架。

Abstract: Psychometric tests, traditionally used to assess humans, are now being
applied to Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate their behavioral traits.
However, existing studies follow a context-free approach, answering each
question in isolation to avoid contextual influence. We term this the Disney
World test, an artificial setting that ignores real-world applications, where
conversational history shapes responses. To bridge this gap, we propose the
first Context-Aware Personality Evaluation (CAPE) framework for LLMs,
incorporating prior conversational interactions. To thoroughly analyze the
influence of context, we introduce novel metrics to quantify the consistency of
LLM responses, a fundamental trait in human behavior.
  Our exhaustive experiments on 7 LLMs reveal that conversational history
enhances response consistency via in-context learning but also induces
personality shifts, with GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-Turbo exhibiting extreme
deviations. While GPT models are robust to question ordering, Gemini-1.5-Flash
and Llama-8B display significant sensitivity. Moreover, GPT models response
stem from their intrinsic personality traits as well as prior interactions,
whereas Gemini-1.5-Flash and Llama--8B heavily depend on prior interactions.
Finally, applying our framework to Role Playing Agents (RPAs) shows
context-dependent personality shifts improve response consistency and better
align with human judgments. Our code and datasets are publicly available at:

### [9] [Measuring Reasoning Utility in LLMs via Conditional Entropy Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20395)
*Xu Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现推理步骤中的条件熵变化模式与答案正确性相关：熵递减对应正确答案，熵平坦或递增则对应错误答案。错误推理路径通常更长，说明更多推理步骤不一定带来更好结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型依赖中间推理步骤提高准确性，但缺乏对推理步骤效用如何影响最终答案正确性的研究。由于自回归生成的随机性，生成更多上下文不能保证答案置信度的提升。

Method: 在MATH数据集上进行oracle研究，使用Qwen2.5-32B和GPT-4o生成推理链，然后用Qwen3-8B量化这些推理链对最终准确性的效用。通过条件熵（词汇表上的期望负对数似然）测量模型在每个推理步骤中对答案Y的不确定性。

Result: 发现明显模式：条件熵随步骤递减与正确答案强相关，而平坦或递增的熵通常导致错误答案。错误推理路径往往比正确路径更长，表明更长的推理不一定产生更好结果。

Conclusion: 这些发现为设计高效推理管道奠定了基础，可以早期检测和避免无效推理，从而提升推理效率和质量。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) often rely on generating
intermediate reasoning steps to enhance accuracy. However, little work has
examined how reasoning utility contributes to the final answer's correctness.
Due to the stochastic nature of autoregressive generation, generating more
context does not guarantee increased confidence in the answer. If we could
predict, during generation, whether a reasoning step will be useful, we could
stop early or prune ineffective steps, avoiding distractions in the final
decision.
  We present an oracle study on MATH dataset, using Qwen2.5-32B and GPT-4o to
generate reasoning chains, and then employing a separate model (Qwen3-8B) to
quantify the utility of these chains for final accuracy. Specifically, we
measure the model's uncertainty on the answer span Y at each reasoning step
using conditional entropy (expected negative log-likelihood over the
vocabulary) with context expanding step by step. Our results show a clear
pattern: conditional entropy that decreases over steps is strongly associated
with correct answers, whereas flat or increasing entropy often results in wrong
answers. We also corroborate that incorrect reasoning paths tend to be longer
than correct ones, suggesting that longer reasoning does not necessarily yield
better outcomes. These findings serve as a foundation to inspire future work on
designing efficient reasoning pipelines that detect and avoid unproductive
reasoning early.

### [11] [DentalBench: Benchmarking and Advancing LLMs Capability for Bilingual Dentistry Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20416)
*Hengchuan Zhu,Yihuan Xu,Yichen Li,Zijie Meng,Zuozhu Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DentalBench是首个针对牙科领域的双语基准测试，包含问答数据集和语料库，评估显示现有LLMs在牙科专业领域存在显著性能差距，领域适应能显著提升模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型和医疗LLMs在通用医疗基准上表现良好，但在牙科等需要深度专业知识的专科领域缺乏针对性评估资源，其能力尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 开发DentalBench基准，包含DentalQA（36,597个中英文问答问题，涵盖4个任务和16个牙科子领域）和DentalCorpus（3.37亿token的高质量牙科语料库）。评估了14个LLMs（专有、开源和医疗专用模型），并使用Qwen-2.5-3B进行领域适应实验。

Result: 评估显示不同模型在任务类型和语言上存在显著性能差距。领域适应实验表明，特别是在知识密集和术语集中的任务上，领域适应能大幅提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 领域特定基准测试对于开发可信赖且有效的医疗应用LLMs至关重要，DentalBench为牙科领域LLMs的发展提供了重要评估资源。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and medical LLMs (Med-LLMs)
have demonstrated strong performance on general medical benchmarks. However,
their capabilities in specialized medical fields, such as dentistry which
require deeper domain-specific knowledge, remain underexplored due to the lack
of targeted evaluation resources. In this paper, we introduce DentalBench, the
first comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to evaluate and advance LLMs
in the dental domain. DentalBench consists of two main components: DentalQA, an
English-Chinese question-answering (QA) benchmark with 36,597 questions
spanning 4 tasks and 16 dental subfields; and DentalCorpus, a large-scale,
high-quality corpus with 337.35 million tokens curated for dental domain
adaptation, supporting both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We evaluate 14 LLMs, covering
proprietary, open-source, and medical-specific models, and reveal significant
performance gaps across task types and languages. Further experiments with
Qwen-2.5-3B demonstrate that domain adaptation substantially improves model
performance, particularly on knowledge-intensive and terminology-focused tasks,
and highlight the importance of domain-specific benchmarks for developing
trustworthy and effective LLMs tailored to healthcare applications.

### [12] [KG-CQR: Leveraging Structured Relation Representations in Knowledge Graphs for Contextual Query Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20417)
*Chi Minh Bui,Ngoc Mai Thieu,Van Vinh Nguyen,Json J. Jung,Khac-Hoai Nam Bui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KG-CQR是一个基于知识图谱的上下文查询检索框架，通过提取和补全相关KG子图来丰富查询上下文，在RAG系统中显著提升检索性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要解决语料库级别的上下文丢失问题，但缺乏对复杂查询的结构化关系表示和语义丰富性处理，需要一种能够通过知识图谱增强查询上下文表示的方法

Method: 提出KG-CQR框架，包含子图提取、子图补全和上下文生成三个模块，通过语料中心知识图谱提取和补全相关子图来生成语义丰富的查询上下文，是一个模型无关的管道方法

Result: 在RAGBench和MultiHop-RAG数据集上，mAP提升4-6%，Recall@25提升2-3%，在多跳问答等挑战性RAG任务中检索效果持续优于现有基线

Conclusion: KG-CQR通过知识图谱的查询上下文增强，有效提升了RAG系统的检索性能，具有模型无关性和可扩展性优势

Abstract: The integration of knowledge graphs (KGs) with large language models (LLMs)
offers significant potential to improve the retrieval phase of
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. In this study, we propose KG-CQR,
a novel framework for Contextual Query Retrieval (CQR) that enhances the
retrieval phase by enriching the contextual representation of complex input
queries using a corpus-centric KG. Unlike existing methods that primarily
address corpus-level context loss, KG-CQR focuses on query enrichment through
structured relation representations, extracting and completing relevant KG
subgraphs to generate semantically rich query contexts. Comprising subgraph
extraction, completion, and contextual generation modules, KG-CQR operates as a
model-agnostic pipeline, ensuring scalability across LLMs of varying sizes
without additional training. Experimental results on RAGBench and MultiHop-RAG
datasets demonstrate KG-CQR's superior performance, achieving a 4-6%
improvement in mAP and a 2-3% improvement in Recall@25 over strong baseline
models. Furthermore, evaluations on challenging RAG tasks such as multi-hop
question answering show that, by incorporating KG-CQR, the performance
consistently outperforms the existing baseline in terms of retrieval
effectiveness

Motivation: 民航维修是知识密集型领域，需要复杂推理能力，但目前缺乏专业的LLM评估工具。当前的LLM评测主要集中在数学和编程推理任务上。

Method: 开发了一个工业级别的民航维修基准测试集，用于评估LLM在该领域的知识空缺和推理能力。同时利用该基准评测现有的矢量嵌入模型和LLM在RAG系统中的表现。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了民航维修领域LLM评估的空白，为领域特定的调优提供了基础，有助于推动更智能化的民航维修解决方案的发展。

Abstract: Civil aviation maintenance is a domain characterized by stringent industry
standards. Within this field, maintenance procedures and troubleshooting
represent critical, knowledge-intensive tasks that require sophisticated
reasoning. To address the lack of specialized evaluation tools for large
language models (LLMs) in this vertical, we propose and develop an
industrial-grade benchmark specifically designed for civil aviation
maintenance. This benchmark serves a dual purpose: It provides a standardized
tool to measure LLM capabilities within civil aviation maintenance, identifying
specific gaps in domain knowledge and complex reasoning. By pinpointing these
deficiencies, the benchmark establishes a foundation for targeted improvement
efforts (e.g., domain-specific fine-tuning, RAG optimization, or specialized
prompt engineering), ultimately facilitating progress toward more intelligent
solutions within civil aviation maintenance. Our work addresses a significant
gap in the current LLM evaluation, which primarily focuses on mathematical and
coding reasoning tasks. In addition, given that Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems are currently the dominant solutions in practical applications ,
we leverage this benchmark to evaluate existing well-known vector embedding
models and LLMs for civil aviation maintenance scenarios. Through experimental
exploration and analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark in
assessing model performance within this domain, and we open-source this
evaluation benchmark and code to foster further research and
development:https://github.com/CamBenchmark/cambenchmark

Motivation: 为了解决实践工作标题搜索问题，利用历史案例经验，通过相似性匹配来寻找最相关的实践工作标题。

Method: 采用案例推理(CBR)技术，结合TF-IDF进行文本向量化处理，使用余弦相似度计算标题之间的相似性值。系统支持标题和关键词两种搜索方式。

Result: 在705个实践工作标题数据集上进行测试，分两个阶段：第一阶段搜索现有标题，第二阶段随机化标题搜索。第二阶段获得了相同数量的匹配标题和更高的平均匹配分数。

Conclusion: 该系统能够有效搜索实践工作标题，TF-IDF和余弦相似度的结合在标题匹配任务中表现良好，验证了CBR方法在文本搜索应用中的可行性。

Abstract: Case Base Reasoning (CBR) is a case solving technique based on experience in
cases that have occurred before with the highest similarity. CBR is used to
search for practical work titles. TF-IDF is applied to process the
vectorization of each practical work title word and Cosine Similarity for the
calculation of similarity values. This system can search either in the form of
titles or keywords. The output of the system is the title of practical work and
the match value of each title. Based on the test results using 705 practical
work titles, testing was carried out with five titles and carried out in two
stages. The first stage searches with existing titles and the second stage
randomizes the title from the first stage. And the results obtained in the
second stage are the same number of titles found and the highest average match
score.

TL;DR: MCP-Bench是一个基于Model Context Protocol的基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在多步骤、跨工具协调的真实任务中的表现，包含28个MCP服务器和250个工具，覆盖金融、旅行、科学计算等多个领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的API基准测试主要依赖显式工具规范、浅层工作流和孤立领域操作，无法充分评估LLM在模糊指令下检索工具、规划多跳执行轨迹、协调跨领域工作流等关键能力。

Method: 基于MCP协议构建基准，连接28个实时MCP服务器，涵盖250个工具，设计真实的多步骤任务，提出包含工具级模式理解、轨迹级规划和任务完成度的多维度评估框架。

Result: 对20个先进LLM的实验显示，在MCP-Bench上仍存在持续挑战，表明当前模型在复杂工具使用和跨域协调方面仍有不足。

Conclusion: MCP-Bench填补了现有基准测试的空白，能够更全面地评估LLM在真实复杂任务中的工具使用能力，为模型发展提供了重要参考基准。

Abstract: We introduce MCP-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models
(LLMs) on realistic, multi-step tasks that demand tool use, cross-tool
coordination, precise parameter control, and planning/reasoning for solving
tasks. Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), MCP-Bench connects LLMs to 28
representative live MCP servers spanning 250 tools across domains such as
finance, traveling, scientific computing, and academic search. Unlike prior
API-based benchmarks, each MCP server provides a set of complementary tools
designed to work together, enabling the construction of authentic, multi-step
tasks with rich input-output coupling. Tasks in MCP-Bench test agents' ability
to retrieve relevant tools from fuzzy instructions without explicit tool names,
plan multi-hop execution trajectories for complex objectives, ground responses
in intermediate tool outputs, and orchestrate cross-domain workflows -
capabilities not adequately evaluated by existing benchmarks that rely on
explicit tool specifications, shallow few-step workflows, and isolated domain
operations. We propose a multi-faceted evaluation framework covering tool-level
schema understanding and usage, trajectory-level planning, and task completion.
Experiments on 20 advanced LLMs reveal persistent challenges in MCP-Bench. Code

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习和自然语言处理的多模态电子病历分析框架，用于预测ICU患者死亡率和资源利用情况，在多个临床任务上优于现有方法，且对结构化数据损坏具有强鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注结构化电子病历数据，忽略了自由文本笔记中的宝贵临床信息，且未充分利用结构化数据中的文本信息潜力。需要开发能够整合多模态电子病历数据的预测模型。

Method: 使用两个真实世界电子病历数据集，开发基于自然语言处理的深度学习框架，包含医疗提示、自由文本和预训练句子编码器三个关键组件，并进行消融研究和数据损坏鲁棒性测试。

Result: 在三个临床任务上：死亡率预测BACC/AUROC提升1.6%/0.8%，住院时长预测RMSE/MAE提升0.5%/2.2%，手术时长估计RMSE/MAE提升10.9%/11.0%，在不同损坏率下均表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架是预测重症监护死亡率和资源利用的有效准确方法，展示了使用提示学习和Transformer编码器分析多模态电子病历的成功，对结构化数据损坏具有强韧性。

Abstract: Background Predicting mortality and resource utilization from electronic
health records (EHRs) is challenging yet crucial for optimizing patient
outcomes and managing costs in intensive care unit (ICU). Existing approaches
predominantly focus on structured EHRs, often ignoring the valuable clinical
insights in free-text notes. Additionally, the potential of textual information
within structured data is not fully leveraged. This study aimed to introduce
and assess a deep learning framework using natural language processing
techniques that integrates multimodal EHRs to predict mortality and resource
utilization in critical care settings. Methods Utilizing two real-world EHR
datasets, we developed and evaluated our model on three clinical tasks with
leading existing methods. We also performed an ablation study on three key
components in our framework: medical prompts, free-texts, and pre-trained
sentence encoder. Furthermore, we assessed the model's robustness against the
corruption in structured EHRs. Results Our experiments on two real-world
datasets across three clinical tasks showed that our proposed model improved
performance metrics by 1.6\%/0.8\% on BACC/AUROC for mortality prediction,
0.5%/2.2% on RMSE/MAE for LOS prediction, 10.9%/11.0% on RMSE/MAE for surgical
duration estimation compared to the best existing methods. It consistently
demonstrated superior performance compared to other baselines across three
tasks at different corruption rates. Conclusions The proposed framework is an
effective and accurate deep learning approach for predicting mortality and
resource utilization in critical care. The study also highlights the success of
using prompt learning with a transformer encoder in analyzing multimodal EHRs.
Importantly, the model showed strong resilience to data corruption within
structured data, especially at high corruption levels.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了ConspirED数据集，用于分析阴谋论内容的认知特征，并评估大语言模型对阴谋论输入的鲁棒性。研究发现LLM/LRM会被阴谋论内容误导，即使能成功处理其他类型错误信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阴谋论侵蚀公众对科学和机构的信任，且随着AI生成错误信息日益复杂，理解阴谋论修辞模式对于开发干预措施和评估AI漏洞至关重要。

Method: 引入ConspirED数据集，基于CONSPIR认知框架标注在线阴谋论文章的多句摘录，开发计算模型识别阴谋论特征，并评估大语言模型对阴谋论输入的鲁棒性。

Result: 发现大语言模型和推理模型都会被阴谋论内容误导，产生反映输入推理模式的输出，即使它们能成功处理类似的事实核查错误信息。

Conclusion: ConspirED是首个标注阴谋论内容一般认知特征的数据集，揭示了AI模型在阴谋论内容面前的脆弱性，为开发针对性干预措施提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Conspiracy theories erode public trust in science and institutions while
resisting debunking by evolving and absorbing counter-evidence. As AI-generated
misinformation becomes increasingly sophisticated, understanding rhetorical
patterns in conspiratorial content is important for developing interventions
such as targeted prebunking and assessing AI vulnerabilities. We introduce
ConspirED (CONSPIR Evaluation Dataset), which captures the cognitive traits of
conspiratorial ideation in multi-sentence excerpts (80--120 words) from online
conspiracy articles, annotated using the CONSPIR cognitive framework
(Lewandowsky and Cook, 2020). ConspirED is the first dataset of conspiratorial
content annotated for general cognitive traits. Using ConspirED, we (i) develop
computational models that identify conspiratorial traits and determine dominant
traits in text excerpts, and (ii) evaluate large language/reasoning model
(LLM/LRM) robustness to conspiratorial inputs. We find that both are misaligned
by conspiratorial content, producing output that mirrors input reasoning
patterns, even when successfully deflecting comparable fact-checked
misinformation.

TL;DR: FLORES+基准测试在200多种语言的多语言机器翻译评估中存在质量问题，包括翻译质量低于声称标准、源文本领域特定性和文化偏见，以及评估协议漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究FLORES+多语言机器翻译基准测试的适用性，发现其在真实多语言评估中存在严重缺陷，需要更准确的评估标准。

Method: 通过人工评估四个语言（Asante Twi、日语、Jinghpaw、南阿塞拜疆语）的翻译质量，分析源文本的领域特定性和文化偏见，并使用简单启发式方法测试评估协议的漏洞。

Result: 发现许多翻译质量低于90%标准，源文本过于领域特定且偏向英语文化，简单命名实体复制就能获得不错的BLEU分数，高质量MT模型在FLORES+上表现差但在相关领域数据上表现好。

Conclusion: 呼吁使用领域通用和文化中立的源文本、减少对命名实体的依赖，以创建更能反映真实世界翻译挑战的多语言MT基准测试。

Abstract: Multilingual machine translation (MT) benchmarks play a central role in
evaluating the capabilities of modern MT systems. Among them, the FLORES+
benchmark is widely used, offering English-to-many translation data for over
200 languages, curated with strict quality control protocols. However, we study
data in four languages (Asante Twi, Japanese, Jinghpaw, and South Azerbaijani)
and uncover critical shortcomings in the benchmark's suitability for truly
multilingual evaluation. Human assessments reveal that many translations fall
below the claimed 90% quality standard, and the annotators report that source
sentences are often too domain-specific and culturally biased toward the
English-speaking world. We further demonstrate that simple heuristics, such as
copying named entities, can yield non-trivial BLEU scores, suggesting
vulnerabilities in the evaluation protocol. Notably, we show that MT models
trained on high-quality, naturalistic data perform poorly on FLORES+ while
achieving significant gains on our domain-relevant evaluation set. Based on
these findings, we advocate for multilingual MT benchmarks that use
domain-general and culturally neutral source texts rely less on named entities,
in order to better reflect real-world translation challenges.

Motivation: 现有主题发现方法主要依赖词嵌入技术，缺乏对科学文献的全面理解，难以处理复杂的高维文本关系。大语言模型在文本理解方面的卓越能力为解决这一问题提供了新的思路。

Method: 1) 构建文本编码器捕获科学文献内容；2) 集成基于熵的采样和LLM引导的三元组任务的空间优化模块；3) 基于LLM指导微调文本编码器，优化对比损失；4) 在三个真实数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: 在三个真实科学文献数据集上的实验表明，SciTopic在科学主题发现任务上优于现有最先进方法，能够帮助研究人员获得更深入、更快速的洞察。

Conclusion: SciTopic通过利用大语言模型的强大文本理解能力，有效解决了传统主题发现方法的局限性，为科学文献主题分析提供了更准确和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Topic discovery in scientific literature provides valuable insights for
researchers to identify emerging trends and explore new avenues for
investigation, facilitating easier scientific information retrieval. Many
machine learning methods, particularly deep embedding techniques, have been
applied to discover research topics. However, most existing topic discovery
methods rely on word embedding to capture the semantics and lack a
comprehensive understanding of scientific publications, struggling with
complex, high-dimensional text relationships. Inspired by the exceptional
comprehension of textual information by large language models (LLMs), we
propose an advanced topic discovery method enhanced by LLMs to improve
scientific topic identification, namely SciTopic. Specifically, we first build
a textual encoder to capture the content from scientific publications,
including metadata, title, and abstract. Next, we construct a space
optimization module that integrates entropy-based sampling and triplet tasks
guided by LLMs, enhancing the focus on thematic relevance and contextual
intricacies between ambiguous instances. Then, we propose to fine-tune the
textual encoder based on the guidance from the LLMs by optimizing the
contrastive loss of the triplets, forcing the text encoder to better
discriminate instances of different topics. Finally, extensive experiments
conducted on three real-world datasets of scientific publications demonstrate
that SciTopic outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) scientific topic
discovery methods, enabling researchers to gain deeper and faster insights.

Motivation: 现有的联邦蒸馏研究主要关注标签多样性，忽略了语言领域（输入）多样性这一NLP中的关键因素，需要更全面的非IID场景评估框架。

Method: 提出了自适应联邦蒸馏框架AdaFD，包含多领域非IID场景的统一基准测试框架，支持同构和异构设置下的多领域非IID挑战处理。

Result: 实验结果表明，该模型能够捕捉本地客户端的多样性，相比现有工作获得更好的性能表现。

Conclusion: AdaFD框架有效解决了多领域非IID数据在联邦学习中的挑战，为真实环境下的联邦学习评估提供了全面基准。

Abstract: The widespread success of pre-trained language models has established a new
training paradigm, where a global PLM is fine-tuned using task-specific data
from local clients. The local data are highly different from each other and can
not capture the global distribution of the whole data in real world. To address
the challenges of non-IID data in real environments, privacy-preserving
federated distillation has been proposed and highly investigated. However,
previous experimental non-IID scenarios are primarily identified with the label
(output) diversity, without considering the diversity of language domains
(input) that is crucial in natural language processing. In this paper, we
introduce a comprehensive set of multi-domain non-IID scenarios and propose a
unified benchmarking framework that includes diverse data. The benchmark can be
used to evaluate the federated learning framework in a real environment. To
this end, we propose an Adaptive Federated Distillation (AdaFD) framework
designed to address multi-domain non-IID challenges in both homogeneous and
heterogeneous settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our models
capture the diversity of local clients and achieve better performance compared
to the existing works. The code for this paper is available at:

Method: 整合大模型萌化、监督精调、直接偏好优化和lookahead解码技术，将仅有0.1B参数的轻量级模型转换为专业化的QDTS专家。

Result: 在多个业界相关指标上超越了生产环境基准线，创造了新的最高水平，并在部署效率上仅需要334台NVIDIA L20 GPU即可处理每秒约50,000个查询，平均延迟仅55ms以内。

Conclusion: 该研究成功将生成式模型应用于工业级别的实时查询驱动文本摘要任务，以较小的计算资源实现了高性能、低延迟的部署方案，为大规模网络搜索应用提供了可行的技术路径。

Abstract: In the dynamic landscape of large-scale web search, Query-Driven Text
Summarization (QDTS) aims to generate concise and informative summaries from
textual documents based on a given query, which is essential for improving user
engagement and facilitating rapid decision-making. Traditional extractive
summarization models, based primarily on ranking candidate summary segments,
have been the dominant approach in industrial applications. However, these
approaches suffer from two key limitations: 1) The multi-stage pipeline often
introduces cumulative information loss and architectural bottlenecks due to its
weakest component; 2) Traditional models lack sufficient semantic understanding
of both user queries and documents, particularly when dealing with complex
search intents. In this study, we propose a novel framework to pioneer the
application of generative models to address real-time QDTS in industrial web
search. Our approach integrates large model distillation, supervised
fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and lookahead decoding to
transform a lightweight model with only 0.1B parameters into a
domain-specialized QDTS expert. Evaluated on multiple industry-relevant
metrics, our model outperforms the production baseline and achieves a new state
of the art. Furthermore, it demonstrates excellent deployment efficiency,
requiring only 334 NVIDIA L20 GPUs to handle \textasciitilde50,000 queries per
second under 55~ms average latency per query.

Motivation: 多跳问答面临数据稀疏性挑战，导致语言模型容易学习伪模式。现有方法主要关注简单问题生成，忽略了文档中相关句子的知识整合。

Method: KCS将知识组合选择建模为句子级条件预测任务，使用概率对比损失预测下一个最相关的知识片段，并在推理时采用随机解码策略平衡准确性和多样性。

Result: KCS在知识组合选择准确率上比基线方法提升3.9%，在HotpotQA和2WikiMultihopQA数据集上的数据增强应用取得了改进。

Conclusion: KCS框架有效提升了多跳问答问题的生成多样性，通过更好的知识组合选择改善了问答性能。

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering faces substantial challenges due to data
sparsity, which increases the likelihood of language models learning spurious
patterns. To address this issue, prior research has focused on diversifying
question generation through content planning and varied expression. However,
these approaches often emphasize generating simple questions and neglect the
integration of essential knowledge, such as relevant sentences within
documents. This paper introduces the Knowledge Composition Sampling (KCS), an
innovative framework designed to expand the diversity of generated multi-hop
questions by sampling varied knowledge compositions within a given context. KCS
models the knowledge composition selection as a sentence-level conditional
prediction task and utilizes a probabilistic contrastive loss to predict the
next most relevant piece of knowledge. During inference, we employ a stochastic
decoding strategy to effectively balance accuracy and diversity. Compared to
competitive baselines, our KCS improves the overall accuracy of knowledge
composition selection by 3.9%, and its application for data augmentation yields
improvements on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA datasets. Our code is available

Result: 发现软提示LLM基准模型与包含GNN的GLM表现相似，GLM在结构化推理任务中表现显著下降

Conclusion: 当前GLM的图语言推理能力有限，CLEGR基准为推进多模态推理研究提供了基础

Abstract: Developments in Graph-Language Models (GLMs) aim to integrate the structural
reasoning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the semantic
understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, we demonstrate that
current evaluation benchmarks for GLMs, which are primarily repurposed
node-level classification datasets, are insufficient to assess multimodal
reasoning. Our analysis reveals that strong performance on these benchmarks is
achievable using unimodal information alone, suggesting that they do not
necessitate graph-language integration. To address this evaluation gap, we
introduce the CLEGR(Compositional Language-Graph Reasoning) benchmark, designed
to evaluate multimodal reasoning at various complexity levels. Our benchmark
employs a synthetic graph generation pipeline paired with questions that
require joint reasoning over structure and textual semantics. We perform a
thorough evaluation of representative GLM architectures and find that
soft-prompted LLM baselines perform on par with GLMs that incorporate a full
GNN backbone. This result calls into question the architectural necessity of
incorporating graph structure into LLMs. We further show that GLMs exhibit
significant performance degradation in tasks that require structural reasoning.
These findings highlight limitations in the graph reasoning capabilities of
current GLMs and provide a foundation for advancing the community toward
explicit multimodal reasoning involving graph structure and language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结构化语音识别系统经常无法正确识别域特定命名实体，导致下游任务出现灾难性失败。传统语音编辑距离方法在词形差异大时效果局限。

Method: 提出一种新的命名实体编正方法，利用语音声音特征来检索候选实体，然后设计生成方法来注释实体错误并替换为正确实体。

Result: 在开源和自建测试集上验证，该方法能够显著提高实体准确率，尤其在词形差异大的场景中效果明显。

Conclusion: 该新方法有效解决了命名实体编正中的词形差异问题，为ASR识别域特定命名实体提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition systems often fail to transcribe
domain-specific named entities, causing catastrophic failures in downstream
tasks. Numerous fast and lightweight named entity correction (NEC) models have
been proposed in recent years. These models, mainly leveraging phonetic-level
edit distance algorithms, have shown impressive performances. However, when the
forms of the wrongly-transcribed words(s) and the ground-truth entity are
significantly different, these methods often fail to locate the wrongly
transcribed words in hypothesis, thus limiting their usage. We propose a novel
NEC method that utilizes speech sound features to retrieve candidate entities.
With speech sound features and candidate entities, we inovatively design a
generative method to annotate entity errors in ASR transcripts and replace the
text with correct entities. This method is effective in scenarios of word form
difference. We test our method using open-source and self-constructed test
sets. The results demonstrate that our NEC method can bring significant
improvement to entity accuracy. We will open source our self-constructed test
set and training data.

distributions across all three sense levels in the PDTB 3.0 framework. We
compare several pre-trained encoder backbones and find that RoBERTa-HArch
achieves the best performance in English, while XLM-RoBERTa-HArch performs best
in the multi-lingual setting. In addition, we compare our fine-tuned models
against GPT-4o and Llama-4-Maverick using few-shot prompting across all
language configurations. Our results show that our fine-tuned models
consistently outperform these LLMs, highlighting the advantages of
task-specific fine-tuning over prompting in IDRR. Finally, we report SOTA
results on the DiscoGeM 1.0 corpus, further validating the effectiveness of our
hierarchical approach.

*Ruiyi Yan,Yugo Murawaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究针对文本隐写和水印中的tokenization不一致问题，发现其由低频和临时性token引起，提出了逐步验证和后验回滚两种解决方案，显著提升了文本质量和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型提升了文本生成能力，一方面改善了文本隐写质量，另一方面也凸显了水印技术防止恶意滥用的重要性。研究发现tokenization不一致会破坏鲁棒性，需要针对性解决。

Method: 通过分析发现导致tokenization不一致的问题token具有低频性和临时性特征，针对隐写提出了逐步验证方法，针对水印提出了后验回滚方法。

Result: 实验表明：1）与传统消歧方法相比，直接解决tokenization不一致问题能提升隐写的流畅性、不可感知性和抗隐写分析能力；2）对水印技术，解决该问题能增强可检测性和抗攻击鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 识别并解决tokenization不一致问题对提升文本隐写和水印技术的性能至关重要，提出的两种针对性方法有效改善了相关指标。

Abstract: Large language models have significantly enhanced the capacities and
efficiency of text generation. On the one hand, they have improved the quality
of text-based steganography. On the other hand, they have also underscored the
importance of watermarking as a safeguard against malicious misuse. In this
study, we focus on tokenization inconsistency (TI) between Alice and Bob in
steganography and watermarking, where TI can undermine robustness. Our
investigation reveals that the problematic tokens responsible for TI exhibit
two key characteristics: infrequency and temporariness. Based on these
findings, we propose two tailored solutions for TI elimination: a stepwise
verification method for steganography and a post-hoc rollback method for
watermarking. Experiments show that (1) compared to traditional disambiguation
methods in steganography, directly addressing TI leads to improvements in
fluency, imperceptibility, and anti-steganalysis capacity; (2) for
watermarking, addressing TI enhances detectability and robustness against
attacks.

TL;DR: rStar2-Agent是一个14B参数的数学推理模型，通过智能体强化学习训练，在有限计算资源下实现前沿性能，在AIME数学竞赛中超越DeepSeek-R1等大型模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数学推理模型主要依赖长链思维（CoT），缺乏自主探索、验证和优化中间步骤的高级认知能力。研究者希望开发一个能够在代码环境中有效推理、处理环境噪声的智能体模型。

Method: 采用三阶段训练方法：1）非推理SFT预训练；2）多阶段RL训练；3）GRPO-RoC算法配合Resample-on-Correct策略处理代码环境噪声；4）高效RL基础设施支持高吞吐量代码执行。

Result: 仅用510个RL步骤和一周时间，在64个MI300X GPU上训练，达到AIME24 80.6%和AIME25 69.8%的平均pass@1分数，超越DeepSeek-R1（671B），响应更短。在数学、对齐、科学推理和工具使用任务上表现优异。

Conclusion: rStar2-Agent证明了智能体强化学习在有限计算资源下实现前沿数学推理性能的可行性，为开发更高效的代码辅助推理模型提供了有效方法，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce rStar2-Agent, a 14B math reasoning model trained with agentic
reinforcement learning to achieve frontier-level performance. Beyond current
long CoT, the model demonstrates advanced cognitive behaviors, such as thinking
carefully before using Python coding tools and reflecting on code execution
feedback to autonomously explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps in
complex problem-solving. This capability is enabled through three key
innovations that makes agentic RL effective at scale: (i) an efficient RL
infrastructure with a reliable Python code environment that supports
high-throughput execution and mitigates the high rollout costs, enabling
training on limited GPU resources (64 MI300X GPUs); (ii) GRPO-RoC, an agentic
RL algorithm with a Resample-on-Correct rollout strategy that addresses the
inherent environment noises from coding tools, allowing the model to reason
more effectively in a code environment; (iii) An efficient agent training
recipe that starts with non-reasoning SFT and progresses through multi-RL
stages, yielding advanced cognitive abilities with minimal compute cost. To
this end, rStar2-Agent boosts a pre-trained 14B model to state of the art in
only 510 RL steps within one week, achieving average pass@1 scores of 80.6% on
AIME24 and 69.8% on AIME25, surpassing DeepSeek-R1 (671B) with significantly
shorter responses. Beyond mathematics, rStar2-Agent-14B also demonstrates
strong generalization to alignment, scientific reasoning, and agentic tool-use
tasks. Code and training recipes are available at

*Stephen Meisenbacher,Maulik Chevli,Florian Matthes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出DP-ST方法，利用语义三元组在本地差分隐私下实现邻域感知的文档生成，通过分治策略和LLM后处理，在较低ε值下实现隐私保护与文本连贯性的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有本地差分隐私文本处理方法在低ε值下效果不佳，需要寻找在严格隐私保护下仍能保持文本连贯性的新方法。

Method: 提出DP-ST方法，基于语义三元组进行分治处理，结合LLM后处理生成连贯文本，限制隐私保护邻域范围。

Result: 该方法在较低ε值下仍能生成连贯文本，实现了隐私保护与实用性的更好平衡。

Conclusion: 通过分治策略和邻域限制，结合LLM处理，可以在严格隐私要求下实现文本连贯性，为低ε值的本地差分隐私文本处理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Many works at the intersection of Differential Privacy (DP) in Natural
Language Processing aim to protect privacy by transforming texts under DP
guarantees. This can be performed in a variety of ways, from word perturbations
to full document rewriting, and most often under local DP. Here, an input text
must be made indistinguishable from any other potential text, within some bound
governed by the privacy parameter $\varepsilon$. Such a guarantee is quite
demanding, and recent works show that privatizing texts under local DP can only
be done reasonably under very high $\varepsilon$ values. Addressing this
challenge, we introduce DP-ST, which leverages semantic triples for
neighborhood-aware private document generation under local DP guarantees.
Through the evaluation of our method, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the
divide-and-conquer paradigm, particularly when limiting the DP notion (and
privacy guarantees) to that of a privatization neighborhood. When combined with
LLM post-processing, our method allows for coherent text generation even at
lower $\varepsilon$ values, while still balancing privacy and utility. These
findings highlight the importance of coherence in achieving balanced
privatization outputs at reasonable $\varepsilon$ levels.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过细调基于LLM的通用嵌入模型，在隐式令人假言语检测任务上实现了独立的最新性能，特别是在跨数据集评估中显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式令人假言语（IHS）通过隐蕴符号、让刺或代码术语传递假恨，因不包含明显谬称而难以检测。传统方法需要外部知识或额外信息来补充。

Method: 仅通过细调最新的通用嵌入模型（如Stella、Jasper、NV-Embed、E5），基于大语言模型（LLMs）构建，无需额外外部知识或复杂流程。

Result: 在多个IHS数据集上进行实验，在数据集内评估中F1-macro指标提升1.10个百分点，跨数据集评估中提升达20.35个百分点，达到了最新的性能水平。

Conclusion: 简单细调通用嵌入模型即可在隐式令人假言语检测中获得显著成效，特别是在跨数据集情况下显示出优异的过渡性能，为IHS检测提供了一种简洁而高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit hate speech (IHS) is indirect language that conveys prejudice or
hatred through subtle cues, sarcasm or coded terminology. IHS is challenging to
detect as it does not include explicit derogatory or inflammatory words. To
address this challenge, task-specific pipelines can be complemented with
external knowledge or additional information such as context, emotions and
sentiment data. In this paper, we show that, by solely fine-tuning recent
general-purpose embedding models based on large language models (LLMs), such as
Stella, Jasper, NV-Embed and E5, we achieve state-of-the-art performance.
Experiments on multiple IHS datasets show up to 1.10 percentage points
improvements for in-dataset, and up to 20.35 percentage points improvements in
cross-dataset evaluation, in terms of F1-macro score.

TL;DR: GUARD是一种自适应的解码方法，通过全局和局部不确定性信号平衡文本生成的连贯性和多样性，同时提高生成速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放式文本生成中连贯性与多样性平衡的挑战，现有对比搜索方法存在超参数依赖和计算成本高的问题

Method: 提出GUARD方法，结合全局熵估计和局部熵偏差的"Glocal"不确定性框架，并加入基于token计数的惩罚机制来降低计算开销

Result: 实验表明GUARD在文本多样性和连贯性之间取得了良好平衡，生成速度显著提升，人工和LLM评估均验证了其优异性能

Conclusion: GUARD提供了一种有效且高效的自适应解码方案，解决了现有方法的局限性，具有理论保证和实际应用价值

Abstract: Open-ended text generation faces a critical challenge: balancing coherence
with diversity in LLM outputs. While contrastive search-based decoding
strategies have emerged to address this trade-off, their practical utility is
often limited by hyperparameter dependence and high computational costs. We
introduce GUARD, a self-adaptive decoding method that effectively balances
these competing objectives through a novel "Glocal" uncertainty-driven
framework. GUARD combines global entropy estimates with local entropy
deviations to integrate both long-term and short-term uncertainty signals. We
demonstrate that our proposed global entropy formulation effectively mitigates
abrupt variations in uncertainty, such as sudden overconfidence or high entropy
spikes, and provides theoretical guarantees of unbiasedness and consistency. To
reduce computational overhead, we incorporate a simple yet effective
token-count-based penalty into GUARD. Experimental results demonstrate that
GUARD achieves a good balance between text diversity and coherence, while
exhibiting substantial improvements in generation speed. In a more nuanced
comparison study across different dimensions of text quality, both human and
LLM evaluators validated its remarkable performance. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 本文进行了真实与LLM生成的认知行为治疗对话在情感动态方面的对比分析，发现合成对话在情感变化、情感语言和反应模式上与真实会话存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型生成的合成治疗对话在心理健康NLP领域的应用日益增多，需要了解这些合成对话是否能够准确摘据真实治疗中的细微情感动态。

Method: 采用Utterance Emotion Dynamics框架分析价值(valence)、舌动(arousal)和主导(dominance)维度的情感轨迹，对比分析真实治疗视频转录和CACTUS数据集中的合成对话。

Result: 合成对话虽然流畅且结构有条理，但在情感变化性、情感语言使用和反应调节模式上与真实对话存在显著差异，客户端情感轨迹相似度尤为低下。

Conclusion: 当前LLM生成的治疗数据在情感保真性方面存在显著局限性，心理健康应用中情感准确性至关重要。研究中还提供了RealCBT数据集支持未来研究。

Abstract: Synthetic therapy dialogues generated by large language models (LLMs) are
increasingly used in mental health NLP to simulate counseling scenarios, train
models, and supplement limited real-world data. However, it remains unclear
whether these synthetic conversations capture the nuanced emotional dynamics of
real therapy. In this work, we conduct the first comparative analysis of
emotional arcs between real and LLM-generated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
dialogues. We adapt the Utterance Emotion Dynamics framework to analyze
fine-grained affective trajectories across valence, arousal, and dominance
dimensions. Our analysis spans both full dialogues and individual speaker roles
(counselor and client), using real sessions transcribed from public videos and
synthetic dialogues from the CACTUS dataset. We find that while synthetic
dialogues are fluent and structurally coherent, they diverge from real
conversations in key emotional properties: real sessions exhibit greater
emotional variability,more emotion-laden language, and more authentic patterns
of reactivity and regulation. Moreover, emotional arc similarity between real
and synthetic speakers is low, especially for clients. These findings
underscore the limitations of current LLM-generated therapy data and highlight
the importance of emotional fidelity in mental health applications. We
introduce RealCBT, a curated dataset of real CBT sessions, to support future
research in this space.

TL;DR: ROSI是一种白盒方法，通过永久性地将模型激活转向拒绝介导子空间来增强LLM的安全对齐，无需微调即可提高安全拒绝率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全对齐机制可以通过消除特定表示方向来绕过，需要一种能够增强而非削弱安全机制的方法

Method: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI)，对所有权重写入矩阵应用简单的秩一权重修改，从小规模有害/无害指令对计算安全方向

Result: ROSI一致提高安全拒绝率（Llama Guard 3评估），同时在MMLU、HellaSwag、Arc等基准测试中保持模型效用，还能重新对齐'未经审查'模型

Conclusion: 定向、可解释的权重引导是改善LLM安全的廉价有效机制，可作为资源密集型微调范式的补充

Abstract: Safety alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) often involves mediating
internal representations to refuse harmful requests. Recent research has
demonstrated that these safety mechanisms can be bypassed by ablating or
removing specific representational directions within the model. In this paper,
we propose the opposite approach: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI), a white-box
method that amplifies a model's safety alignment by permanently steering its
activations toward the refusal-mediating subspace. ROSI operates as a simple,
fine-tuning-free rank-one weight modification applied to all residual stream
write matrices. The required safety direction can be computed from a small set
of harmful and harmless instruction pairs. We show that ROSI consistently
increases safety refusal rates - as evaluated by Llama Guard 3 - while
preserving the utility of the model on standard benchmarks such as MMLU,
HellaSwag, and Arc. Furthermore, we show that ROSI can also re-align
'uncensored' models by amplifying their own latent safety directions,
demonstrating its utility as an effective last-mile safety procedure. Our
results suggest that targeted, interpretable weight steering is a cheap and
potent mechanism to improve LLM safety, complementing more resource-intensive
fine-tuning paradigms.

Conclusion: 领域适应方法在跨语言和跨文本类型的认知扭曲检测中显示出最大的应用潜力

Abstract: Rising mental health issues among youth have increased interest in automated
approaches for detecting early signs of psychological distress in digital text.
One key focus is the identification of cognitive distortions, irrational
thought patterns that have a role in aggravating mental distress. Early
detection of these distortions may enable timely, low-cost interventions. While
prior work has focused on English clinical data, we present the first in-depth
study of cross-lingual and cross-register generalization of cognitive
distortion detection, analyzing forum posts written by Dutch adolescents. Our
findings show that while changes in language and writing style can
significantly affect model performance, domain adaptation methods show the most
promise.

Conclusion: GDLLM框架通过有效捕捉全局特征，能够显著增强少数关系类的识别性能，并提升整体的事件时序关系抽取能力。

Abstract: In Natural Language Processing(NLP), Event Temporal Relation Extraction
(ETRE) is to recognize the temporal relations of two events. Prior studies have
noted the importance of language models for ETRE. However, the restricted
pre-trained knowledge of Small Language Models(SLMs) limits their capability to
handle minority class relations in imbalanced classification datasets. For
Large Language Models(LLMs), researchers adopt manually designed prompts or
instructions, which may introduce extra noise, leading to interference with the
model's judgment of the long-distance dependencies between events. To address
these issues, we propose GDLLM, a Global Distance-aware modeling approach based
on LLMs. We first present a distance-aware graph structure utilizing Graph
Attention Network(GAT) to assist the LLMs in capturing long-distance dependency
features. Additionally, we design a temporal feature learning paradigm based on
soft inference to augment the identification of relations with a short-distance
proximity band, which supplements the probabilistic information generated by
LLMs into the multi-head attention mechanism. Since the global feature can be
captured effectively, our framework substantially enhances the performance of
minority relation classes and improves the overall learning ability.
Experiments on two publicly available datasets, TB-Dense and MATRES,
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个可扩展的评测框架，用于构建多源检索与合成的RAG系统测试基准，并创建了MSRS-Story和MSRS-Meet两个新的测试集，以演绎实际应用中需要从多个来源整合信息的长文本回答任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG系统评估多假设问题答案可以从单个来源找到或者是短形式事实性问题，而真实应用常常需要从多个分散来源整合和汇总信息来生成长文本回答。

Method: 提出了一个可扩展的框架来构建评测基准，创建了MSRS-Story和MSRS-Meet两个新测试集，分别代表故事合成和会议摘要任务，并使用各种RAG流水线（包括稀疏和浓密检索器结合前沿LLM）进行实验。

Result: 实验结果显示生成质量很大程度依赖于检索效果，而检索效果又因任务类型而异。多源合成在甚至在神谕检索设置下也很具有挑战性，但理论模型在这一步骤中显著超过了标准LLM。

Conclusion: 论文提出的框架和新测试集有助于更好地评估RAG系统在复杂多源整合任务中的表现，并证明了检索效果对生成质量的关键影响以及理论模型在多源合成任务中的优势。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented systems are typically evaluated in settings where
information required to answer the query can be found within a single source or
the answer is short-form or factoid-based. However, many real-world
applications demand the ability to integrate and summarize information
scattered across multiple sources, where no single source is sufficient to
respond to the user's question. In such settings, the retrieval component of a
RAG pipeline must recognize a variety of relevance signals, and the generation
component must connect and synthesize information across multiple sources. We
present a scalable framework for constructing evaluation benchmarks that
challenge RAG systems to integrate information across distinct sources and
generate long-form responses. Using our framework, we build two new benchmarks
on Multi-Source Retrieval and Synthesis: MSRS-Story and MSRS-Meet, representing
narrative synthesis and summarization tasks, respectively, that require
retrieval from large collections. Our extensive experiments with various RAG
pipelines -- including sparse and dense retrievers combined with frontier LLMs
-- reveal that generation quality is highly dependent on retrieval
effectiveness, which varies greatly by task. While multi-source synthesis
proves challenging even in an oracle retrieval setting, we find that reasoning
models significantly outperform standard LLMs at this distinct step.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化对多语言任务的影响尚未充分探索，特别是在机器翻译领域，需要研究不同量化技术对多种语言的影响。

Method: 使用5个参数量从17亿到700亿的大语言模型，在55种语言上进行后训练量化评估，比较了AWQ、BitsAndBytes、GGUF和AutoRound四种量化技术。

Result: 4位量化对高资源语言和大模型影响较小，但2位量化对低资源和类型多样语言造成显著质量下降；GGUF在2位精度下表现最一致；语言匹配的校准在低比特场景下有益。

Conclusion: 研究为在量化约束下部署多语言大语言模型提供了实用见解，特别是在低资源设置中，算法选择和模型大小共同决定了量化鲁棒性。

Abstract: Quantization is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) on
resource-constrained hardware, but its implications for multilingual tasks
remain underexplored. We conduct the first large-scale evaluation of
post-training quantization (PTQ) on machine translation across 55 languages
using five LLMs ranging from 1.7B to 70B parameters. Our analysis reveals that
while 4-bit quantization often preserves translation quality for high-resource
languages and large models, significant degradation occurs for low-resource and
typologically diverse languages, particularly in 2-bit settings. We compare
four quantization techniques (AWQ, BitsAndBytes, GGUF, and AutoRound), showing
that algorithm choice and model size jointly determine robustness. GGUF
variants provide the most consistent performance, even at 2-bit precision.
Additionally, we quantify the interactions between quantization, decoding
hyperparameters, and calibration languages, finding that language-matched
calibration offers benefits primarily in low-bit scenarios. Our findings offer
actionable insights for deploying multilingual LLMs for machine translation
under quantization constraints, especially in low-resource settings.

Motivation: 语音到语音大语言模型(S2S LLMs)是人机自然交互的基础，但目前缺乏有效的评估方法。现有级联方法忽略了声学特征，且语音偏好数据稀缺，需要开发更全面的评估框架。

Method: 提出SageLM模型：1) 联合评估语义和声学维度；2) 使用理性监督增强可解释性；3) 构建SpeechFeedback合成偏好数据集；4) 采用两阶段训练范式缓解数据稀缺问题。

Result: SageLM与人类评估者的一致率达到82.79%，分别比级联基线和SLM基线高出至少7.42%和26.20%，表现出优异的评估性能。

Conclusion: SageLM通过多维度联合评估、理性监督和创新的训练方法，有效解决了S2S LLMs评估的挑战，为语音对话系统的端到端评估提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Speech-to-Speech (S2S) Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational to
natural human-computer interaction, enabling end-to-end spoken dialogue
systems. However, evaluating these models remains a fundamental challenge. We
propose \texttt{SageLM}, an end-to-end, multi-aspect, and explainable speech
LLM for comprehensive S2S LLMs evaluation. First, unlike cascaded approaches
that disregard acoustic features, SageLM jointly assesses both semantic and
acoustic dimensions. Second, it leverages rationale-based supervision to
enhance explainability and guide model learning, achieving superior alignment
with evaluation outcomes compared to rule-based reinforcement learning methods.
Third, we introduce \textit{SpeechFeedback}, a synthetic preference dataset,
and employ a two-stage training paradigm to mitigate the scarcity of speech
preference data. Trained on both semantic and acoustic dimensions, SageLM
achieves an 82.79\% agreement rate with human evaluators, outperforming
cascaded and SLM-based baselines by at least 7.42\% and 26.20\%, respectively.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning and planning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) have enabled their potential as autonomous agents capable of tool
use in dynamic environments. However, in multi-turn conversational environments
like $\tau$-bench, these agents often struggle with consistent reasoning,
adherence to domain-specific policies, and extracting correct information over
a long horizon of tool-calls and conversation. To capture and mitigate these
failures, we conduct a comprehensive manual analysis of the common errors
occurring in the conversation trajectories. We then experiment with
reformulations of inputs to the tool-calling agent for improvement in agent
decision making. Finally, we propose the Input-Reformulation Multi-Agent (IRMA)
framework, which automatically reformulates user queries augmented with
relevant domain rules and tool suggestions for the tool-calling agent to focus
on. The results show that IRMA significantly outperforms ReAct, Function
Calling, and Self-Reflection by 16.1%, 12.7%, and 19.1%, respectively, in
overall pass^5 scores. These findings highlight the superior reliability and
consistency of IRMA compared to other methods in dynamic environments.

*Jiaqian Li,Qisheng Hu,Jing Li,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的两阶段示例选择策略，通过结构意识监督和插件模块提升语义解析任务的上下文学习性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的上下文学习示例选择策略在结构化预测任务中忽视了结构对齐问题，导致性能不佳和氛化能力差

Method: 首先使用结构意识监督微调BERT基础的捕获器，然后通过插件模块增强隐藏表示中的语法有意义信息

Result: 在四个语义解析任务的基准测试中均表现超过现有基线方法，多个最新大语言模型都获得了一致性提升

Conclusion: 该方法在效率、氛化能力和性能之间实现了良好平衡，插件模块具有模型无关性、开销低的优点，可无缝集成到现有流程中

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has become a powerful paradigm that enables LLMs to
perform a wide range of tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. However, the
effectiveness of ICL heavily depends on the quality of exemplar selection. In
particular, for structured prediction tasks such as semantic parsing, existing
ICL selection strategies often overlook structural alignment, leading to
suboptimal performance and poor generalization. To address this issue, we
propose a novel two-stage exemplar selection strategy that achieves a strong
balance between efficiency, generalizability, and performance. First, we
fine-tune a BERT-based retriever using structure-aware supervision, guiding it
to select exemplars that are both semantically relevant and structurally
aligned. Then, we enhance the retriever with a plug-in module, which amplifies
syntactically meaningful information in the hidden representations. This
plug-in is model-agnostic, requires minimal overhead, and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing pipelines. Experiments on four benchmarks spanning
three semantic parsing tasks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing baselines with multiple recent LLMs as inference-time
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主动对话研究主要集中在特定领域或任务导向场景，导致评估碎片化，限制了全面探索模型的主动对话能力。

Method: 提出ProactiveEval框架，将主动对话分解为目标规划和对话引导两个维度，建立跨领域评估指标，支持自动生成多样化评估数据，开发了6个领域的328个评估环境。

Result: 实验测试22种不同类型的大语言模型，发现DeepSeek-R1在目标规划任务上表现优异，Claude-3.7-Sonnet在对话引导任务上表现最佳。

Conclusion: 研究了推理能力对主动行为的影响，并讨论了其对未来模型发展的启示，为全面评估大语言模型的主动对话能力提供了统一框架。

Abstract: Proactive dialogue has emerged as a critical and challenging research problem
in advancing large language models (LLMs). Existing works predominantly focus
on domain-specific or task-oriented scenarios, which leads to fragmented
evaluations and limits the comprehensive exploration of models' proactive
conversation abilities. In this work, we propose ProactiveEval, a unified
framework designed for evaluating proactive dialogue capabilities of LLMs. This
framework decomposes proactive dialogue into target planning and dialogue
guidance, establishing evaluation metrics across various domains. Moreover, it
also enables the automatic generation of diverse and challenging evaluation
data. Based on the proposed framework, we develop 328 evaluation environments
spanning 6 distinct domains. Through experiments with 22 different types of
LLMs, we show that DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-3.7-Sonnet exhibit exceptional
performance on target planning and dialogue guidance tasks, respectively.
Finally, we investigate how reasoning capabilities influence proactive
behaviors and discuss their implications for future model development.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LETHE是一种通过知识稀释消除LLM后门行为的新方法，结合内部模型合并和外部提示增强，有效防御多种高级后门攻击，攻击成功率降低达98%且保持模型效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门防御方法存在局限性：要么只关注窄范围触发设置，要么只是检测机制，要么无法应对模型编辑、多触发器和无触发器等高级攻击场景，需要更全面的防御方案。

Method: LETHE采用内部和外部双重机制：内部使用轻量数据集训练干净模型并与后门模型合并，稀释后门影响；外部在提示中加入良性相关证据，分散模型对后门特征的注意力。

Result: 在5个主流LLM的分类和生成任务上测试，LETHE优于8个SOTA防御基线，对抗8种后门攻击，将高级后门攻击成功率降低高达98%，同时保持模型效用，且成本效益高、对自适应攻击鲁棒。

Conclusion: LETHE提供了一种全面有效的后门消除方案，通过知识稀释机制成功防御多种复杂后门攻击，在保持模型性能的同时显著提升安全性，为LLM安全防御提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen significant advancements, achieving
superior performance in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.
However, they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where models behave
normally for standard queries but generate harmful responses or unintended
output when specific triggers are activated. Existing backdoor defenses either
lack comprehensiveness, focusing on narrow trigger settings, detection-only
mechanisms, and limited domains, or fail to withstand advanced scenarios like
model-editing-based, multi-trigger, and triggerless attacks. In this paper, we
present LETHE, a novel method to eliminate backdoor behaviors from LLMs through
knowledge dilution using both internal and external mechanisms. Internally,
LETHE leverages a lightweight dataset to train a clean model, which is then
merged with the backdoored model to neutralize malicious behaviors by diluting
the backdoor impact within the model's parametric memory. Externally, LETHE
incorporates benign and semantically relevant evidence into the prompt to
distract LLM's attention from backdoor features. Experimental results on
classification and generation domains across 5 widely used LLMs demonstrate
that LETHE outperforms 8 state-of-the-art defense baselines against 8 backdoor
attacks. LETHE reduces the attack success rate of advanced backdoor attacks by
up to 98% while maintaining model utility. Furthermore, LETHE has proven to be
cost-efficient and robust against adaptive backdoor attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决中小企业在部署检索增强生成(RAG)系统时面临的资源有限和自然语言处理专业知识缺乏的挑战。

Method: 基于方法工程原则，设计了包含明确角色、活动和技术的EASI-RAG方法，通过真实案例研究在环境测试实验室中验证。

Conclusion: EASI-RAG证明了RAG在工业中小企业中部署的潜力，未来需要进一步推广到多样化用例并与微调模型集成。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful solution to
mitigate the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
hallucinations and outdated knowledge. However, deploying RAG-based tools in
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) remains a challenge due to their limited
resources and lack of expertise in natural language processing (NLP). This
paper introduces EASI-RAG, Enterprise Application Support for Industrial RAG, a
structured, agile method designed to facilitate the deployment of RAG systems
in industrial SME contexts. EASI-RAG is based on method engineering principles
and comprises well-defined roles, activities, and techniques. The method was
validated through a real-world case study in an environmental testing
laboratory, where a RAG tool was implemented to answer operators queries using
data extracted from operational procedures. The system was deployed in under a
month by a team with no prior RAG experience and was later iteratively improved
based on user feedback. Results demonstrate that EASI-RAG supports fast
implementation, high user adoption, delivers accurate answers, and enhances the
reliability of underlying data. This work highlights the potential of RAG
deployment in industrial SMEs. Future works include the need for generalization
across diverse use cases and further integration with fine-tuned models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出使用胶囊网络中的动态路由进行句子关系抽取，在多个标准数据集上表现优异，但在大规模Wikidata数据集上性能较差，发现标签噪声和重表示能力是影响性能的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 句子关系抽取是NLP中的重要任务，现有方法在大规模远程监督数据集上性能不佳，需要探索更有效的表示学习方法。

Method: 采用胶囊网络的动态路由机制进行句子关系抽取，通过胶囊间的动态信息传递来学习更好的关系表示。

Result: 在Tacred、Tacredrev、Retacred和Conll04数据集上达到state-of-the-art性能，但在Wikidata数据集上表现较差，发现标签噪声是主要原因。

Conclusion: 除了标签噪声问题外，重表示能力（re-representation）是句子关系抽取中的另一个重要挑战，提出的胶囊网络方法在重表示方面优于传统模型。

Abstract: Sentential relation extraction (RE) is an important task in natural language
processing (NLP). In this paper we propose to do sentential RE with dynamic
routing in capsules. We first show that the proposed approach outperform state
of the art on common sentential relation extraction datasets Tacred, Tacredrev,
Retacred, and Conll04. We then investigate potential reasons for its good
performance on the mentioned datasets, and yet low performance on another
similar, yet larger sentential RE dataset, Wikidata. As such, we identify noise
in Wikidata labels as one of the reasons that can hinder performance.
Additionally, we show associativity of better performance with better
re-representation, a term from neuroscience referred to change of
representation in human brain to improve the match at comparison time. As
example, in the given analogous terms King:Queen::Man:Woman, at comparison
time, and as a result of re-representation, the similarity between related head
terms (King,Man), and tail terms (Queen,Woman) increases. As such, our
observation show that our proposed model can do re-representation better than
the vanilla model compared with. To that end, beside noise in the labels of the
distantly supervised RE datasets, we propose re-representation as a challenge
in sentential RE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 税务申报需要复杂的规则推理和数值计算，传统方法耗时且易出错，而纯语言模型缺乏所需的准确性和可审计性

Method: 将LLMs与符号求解器集成，将文本规则翻译为形式逻辑程序，并结合智能检索的案例表示范例

Result: 系统在SARA数据集上性能显著提升，部署成本远低于现实世界平均税务申报成本

Conclusion: 神经符号架构为实现公平可靠的税务援助提供了可行且经济高效的技术路径

Abstract: According to the United States Internal Revenue Service, ''the average
American spends $\$270$ and 13 hours filing their taxes''. Even beyond the
U.S., tax filing requires complex reasoning, combining application of
overlapping rules with numerical calculations. Because errors can incur costly
penalties, any automated system must deliver high accuracy and auditability,
making modern large language models (LLMs) poorly suited for this task. We
propose an approach that integrates LLMs with a symbolic solver to calculate
tax obligations. We evaluate variants of this system on the challenging
StAtutory Reasoning Assessment (SARA) dataset, and include a novel method for
estimating the cost of deploying such a system based on real-world penalties
for tax errors. We further show how combining up-front translation of
plain-text rules into formal logic programs, combined with intelligently
retrieved exemplars for formal case representations, can dramatically improve
performance on this task and reduce costs to well below real-world averages.
Our results demonstrate the promise and economic feasibility of neuro-symbolic
architectures for increasing equitable access to reliable tax assistance.

TL;DR: 通过CHAIR指标和DPO对齐训练，有效减少多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型存在严重的幻觉问题，需要找到一种简单有效的对齐方法来减少正文与视觉输入不一致的回答

Method: 利用CHAIR指标识别幻觉和非幻觉样本，通过直接偏好优化(DPO)方法对现有MLLMs进行对齐细调

Result: CHAIR-DPO方法在多个幻觉测试集上显著减少了幻觉回答的数量

Conclusion: 基于CHAIR的奖励机制细调有效提升MLLMs的对齐性能，为解决幻觉问题提供了简单而高效的方案

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) emerge as a unified interface to
address a multitude of tasks, ranging from NLP to computer vision. Despite
showcasing state-of-the-art results in many benchmarks, a long-standing issue
is the tendency of MLLMs to hallucinate, that is to generate answers to the
user's query that are not reflected in the visual input. In this paper, we
address the problem of hallucinations as an alignment problem, seeking to steer
the MLLM so that it prefers generating content without hallucinations. In
contrast to recent approaches that require complicated pipelines to build
synthetic preference data for alignment training, often relying on proprietary
models, we capitalize on the well-known CHAIR metric, originally proposed to
gauge the degree of hallucinations in image captioning. Given a pair of
generated answers, we leverage CHAIR to distinguish winner and loser options
(i.e., non-hallucinated and hallucinated samples) and fine-tune off-the-shelf
MLLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The resulting method, which we
refer to as CHAIR-DPO, effectively diminishes the amount of hallucinated
answers on several hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
fine-tuning the MLLM with a CHAIR-based reward. Source code and trained models
are publicly available at https://github.com/aimagelab/CHAIR-DPO.

Motivation: 现有图像伪造定位方法依赖人工标注数据，无法跟上多模态大模型驱动的图像编辑技术发展，需要更高效的方案

Method: 利用SD3多模态处理能力，将高速筛波器提取的图像伪造残差作为显式模态融合到潜空间进行训练，保留输入图像的丰富语义信息

Result: 在广泛使用的标准数据集上达到了相比当前最先进模型提升12%的性能提升，对训练未见的真实文档伪造和自然场景图像也表现出强劲性能

Conclusion: 该框架成功将SD的图像生成和感知能力集成到图像侯检中，为应对新兴图像编辑技术的伪造检测提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Driven by the new generation of multi-modal large models, such as Stable
Diffusion (SD), image manipulation technologies have advanced rapidly, posing
significant challenges to image forensics. However, existing image forgery
localization methods, which heavily rely on labor-intensive and costly
annotated data, are struggling to keep pace with these emerging image
manipulation technologies. To address these challenges, we are the first to
integrate both image generation and powerful perceptual capabilities of SD into
an image forensic framework, enabling more efficient and accurate forgery
localization. First, we theoretically show that the multi-modal architecture of
SD can be conditioned on forgery-related information, enabling the model to
inherently output forgery localization results. Then, building on this
foundation, we specifically leverage the multimodal framework of Stable
DiffusionV3 (SD3) to enhance forgery localization performance.We leverage the
multi-modal processing capabilities of SD3 in the latent space by treating
image forgery residuals -- high-frequency signals extracted using specific
highpass filters -- as an explicit modality. This modality is fused into the
latent space during training to enhance forgery localization performance.
Notably, our method fully preserves the latent features extracted by SD3,
thereby retaining the rich semantic information of the input image.
Experimental results show that our framework achieves up to 12% improvements in
performance on widely used benchmarking datasets compared to current
state-of-the-art image forgery localization models. Encouragingly, the model
demonstrates strong performance on forensic tasks involving real-world document
forgery images and natural scene forging images, even when such data were
entirely unseen during training.

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型与定量属性的结合为提升AI皮肤疾病诊断模型的可解释性提供了有前景的方向，使模型预测能够基于可解释的概念进行推理。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence models have demonstrated significant success in
diagnosing skin diseases, including cancer, showing the potential to assist
clinicians in their analysis. However, the interpretability of model
predictions must be significantly improved before they can be used in practice.
To this end, we explore the combination of two promising approaches: Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) and quantitative attribute usage. MLLMs offer a
potential avenue for increased interpretability, providing reasoning for
diagnosis in natural language through an interactive format. Separately, a
number of quantitative attributes that are related to lesion appearance (e.g.,
lesion area) have recently been found predictive of malignancy with high
accuracy. Predictions grounded as a function of such concepts have the
potential for improved interpretability. We provide evidence that MLLM
embedding spaces can be grounded in such attributes, through fine-tuning to
predict their values from images. Concretely, we evaluate this grounding in the
embedding space through an attribute-specific content-based image retrieval
case study using the SLICE-3D dataset.

Motivation: 现有自动调制识别方法依赖大量标注数据或多阶段训练流程，限制了实际应用中的可扩展性和泛化能力

Method: 使用ViT编码器、轻量级卷积解码器和线性分类器，通过重构分支将增强信号映射回原始信号，在预训练中学习鲁棒特征，微调时使用部分标签监督

Result: 在RML2018.01A数据集上，低标签条件下优于监督CNN和ViT基线，仅用15-20%标注数据即可达到ResNet水平精度，在不同SNR下保持强性能

Conclusion: 该框架为自动调制识别提供了简单、可泛化且标签高效的解决方案

Abstract: Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is critical for cognitive radio,
spectrum monitoring, and secure wireless communication. However, existing
solutions often rely on large labeled datasets or multi-stage training
pipelines, which limit scalability and generalization in practice. We propose a
unified Vision Transformer (ViT) framework that integrates supervised,
self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives. The model combines a ViT
encoder, a lightweight convolutional decoder, and a linear classifier; the
reconstruction branch maps augmented signals back to their originals, anchoring
the encoder to fine-grained I/Q structure. This strategy promotes robust,
discriminative feature learning during pretraining, while partial label
supervision in fine-tuning enables effective classification with limited
labels. On the RML2018.01A dataset, our approach outperforms supervised CNN and
ViT baselines in low-label regimes, approaches ResNet-level accuracy with only
15-20% labeled data, and maintains strong performance across varying SNR
levels. Overall, the framework provides a simple, generalizable, and
label-efficient solution for AMR.

Conclusion: InfinityHuman通过稳定的姿态引导和手部奖励机制，有效解决了音频驱动动画中的长期一致性和手部运动真实性问题，为高质量长视频生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation has attracted wide attention thanks to its
practical applications. However, critical challenges remain in generating
high-resolution, long-duration videos with consistent appearance and natural
hand motions. Existing methods extend videos using overlapping motion frames
but suffer from error accumulation, leading to identity drift, color shifts,
and scene instability. Additionally, hand movements are poorly modeled,
resulting in noticeable distortions and misalignment with the audio. In this
work, we propose InfinityHuman, a coarse-to-fine framework that first generates
audio-synchronized representations, then progressively refines them into
high-resolution, long-duration videos using a pose-guided refiner. Since pose
sequences are decoupled from appearance and resist temporal degradation, our
pose-guided refiner employs stable poses and the initial frame as a visual
anchor to reduce drift and improve lip synchronization. Moreover, to enhance
semantic accuracy and gesture realism, we introduce a hand-specific reward
mechanism trained with high-quality hand motion data. Experiments on the EMTD
and HDTF datasets show that InfinityHuman achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video quality, identity preservation, hand accuracy, and lip-sync. Ablation
studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module. Code will be made
public.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 360度视频在VR中提供全视场体验，但缺乏包含空间音频的全面数据集来预测视觉显著性。现有方法未能充分处理球面畸变和音频-视觉整合的复杂性。

Method: 创建YT360-EyeTracking数据集（81个ODV视频），提出SalViT360（基于视觉变换器，具有球面几何感知的时空注意力层）和SalViT360-AV（额外加入音频条件变换器适配器）两个显著性预测模型。

Result: 在多个基准数据集（包括自建的YT360-EyeTracking）上的实验表明，SalViT360和SalViT360-AV在预测360度场景中的观看者注意力方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 在模型架构中整合空间音频线索对于准确预测全向视频中的视觉显著性至关重要，音频-视觉融合能有效提升显著性预测性能。

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos (ODVs) are redefining viewer experiences in virtual
reality (VR) by offering an unprecedented full field-of-view (FOV). This study
extends the domain of saliency prediction to 360-degree environments,
addressing the complexities of spherical distortion and the integration of
spatial audio. Contextually, ODVs have transformed user experience by adding a
spatial audio dimension that aligns sound direction with the viewer's
perspective in spherical scenes. Motivated by the lack of comprehensive
datasets for 360-degree audio-visual saliency prediction, our study curates
YT360-EyeTracking, a new dataset of 81 ODVs, each observed under varying
audio-visual conditions. Our goal is to explore how to utilize audio-visual
cues to effectively predict visual saliency in 360-degree videos. Towards this
aim, we propose two novel saliency prediction models: SalViT360, a
vision-transformer-based framework for ODVs equipped with spherical
geometry-aware spatio-temporal attention layers, and SalViT360-AV, which
further incorporates transformer adapters conditioned on audio input. Our
results on a number of benchmark datasets, including our YT360-EyeTracking,
demonstrate that SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV significantly outperform existing
methods in predicting viewer attention in 360-degree scenes. Interpreting these
results, we suggest that integrating spatial audio cues in the model
architecture is crucial for accurate saliency prediction in omnidirectional
videos. Code and dataset will be available at

Motivation: 当前视觉模型开发主要关注性能指标，缺乏对模型可解释性的重视。现有xAI方法多仅解释单个样本，而能够揭示模型在大规模数据集上一般性行为的方法较少，这对防止偏见判断和理解模型趋势很重要。

Method: 利用视觉-语言模型(VLM)，提出了一种可以同时在样本级别和数据集级别解释视觉模型的流水线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法将视觉模型开发与xAI分析相结合，推动了图像分析领域的进步，提供了一种综合性的模型解释方案。

Abstract: The development of many vision models mainly focuses on improving their
performance using metrics such as accuracy, IoU, and mAP, with less attention
to explainability due to the complexity of applying xAI methods to provide a
meaningful explanation of trained models. Although many existing xAI methods
aim to explain vision models sample-by-sample, methods explaining the general
behavior of vision models, which can only be captured after running on a large
dataset, are still underexplored. Furthermore, understanding the behavior of
vision models on general images can be very important to prevent biased
judgments and help identify the model's trends and patterns. With the
application of Vision-Language Models, this paper proposes a pipeline to
explain vision models at both the sample and dataset levels. The proposed
pipeline can be used to discover failure cases and gain insights into vision
models with minimal effort, thereby integrating vision model development with
xAI analysis to advance image analysis.

Conclusion: ATMS-KD框架在保持低推理延迟的同时实现了高效的知识转移，为农业环境中的轻量级模型部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This study proposes ATMS-KD (Adaptive Temperature and Mixed-Sample Knowledge
Distillation), a novel framework for developing lightweight CNN models suitable
for resource-constrained agricultural environments. The framework combines
adaptive temperature scheduling with mixed-sample augmentation to transfer
knowledge from a MobileNetV3 Large teacher model (5.7\,M parameters) to
lightweight residual CNN students. Three student configurations were evaluated:
Compact (1.3\,M parameters), Standard (2.4\,M parameters), and Enhanced (3.8\,M
parameters). The dataset used in this study consists of images of \textit{Rosa
damascena} (Damask rose) collected from agricultural fields in the Dades Oasis,
southeastern Morocco, providing a realistic benchmark for agricultural computer
vision applications under diverse environmental conditions. Experimental
evaluation on the Damascena rose maturity classification dataset demonstrated
significant improvements over direct training methods. All student models
achieved validation accuracies exceeding 96.7\% with ATMS-KD compared to
95--96\% with direct training. The framework outperformed eleven established
knowledge distillation methods, achieving 97.11\% accuracy with the compact
model -- a 1.60 percentage point improvement over the second-best approach
while maintaining the lowest inference latency of 72.19\,ms. Knowledge
retention rates exceeded 99\% for all configurations, demonstrating effective
knowledge transfer regardless of student model capacity.

TL;DR: 这项研究提出了一种新的混合视觉-语言表征框架，通过结合深度语义分割和预训练多模态模型，实现了异构微观结构的零样本分类，提高了材料质量评估的敏感性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: Rapid and reliable qualification of advanced materials remains a bottleneck
in industrial manufacturing, particularly for heterogeneous structures produced
via non-conventional additive manufacturing processes. This study introduces a
novel framework that links microstructure informatics with a range of expert
characterization knowledge using customized and hybrid vision-language
representations (VLRs). By integrating deep semantic segmentation with
pre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA), we encode both visual
microstructural data and textual expert assessments into shared
representations. To overcome limitations in general-purpose embeddings, we
develop a customized similarity-based representation that incorporates both
positive and negative references from expert-annotated images and their
associated textual descriptions. This allows zero-shot classification of
previously unseen microstructures through a net similarity scoring approach.
Validation on an additively manufactured metal matrix composite dataset
demonstrates the framework's ability to distinguish between acceptable and
defective samples across a range of characterization criteria. Comparative
analysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the
CLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria. Z-score
normalization adjusts raw unimodal and cross-modal similarity scores based on
their local dataset-driven distributions, enabling more effective alignment and
classification in the hybrid vision-language framework. The proposed method
enhances traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines by
enabling human-in-the-loop decision-making without task-specific model
retraining. By advancing semantic interoperability between raw data and expert
knowledge, this work contributes toward scalable and domain-adaptable
qualification strategies in engineering informatics.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于MedNeXt-L-k5的自动化软脚空间（PVS）分割方法，在T2加权MRI图像上达到了预计的人工分割可靠性水平，但在T1加权图像和多中心数据上性能有所下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动分割PVS耗时且可靠性中等，现有的自动化深度学习模型性能中等且穿越不同数据集的通用性弱。需要开发更高效、更准确的自动化PVS分割方法。

Method: 采用Transformer受启发的3D编码器-解码器卷积网络MedNeXt-L-k5进行自动PVS分割。训练两个模型：一个使用HCP-Aging数据集的200份T2加权MRI扫描，另一个使用来自6台扫描仪的7个研究的40份T1加权MRI数据。使用5折交叉验证和留一个地点交叉验证评估模型性能。

Result: 在T2加权图像上，模型达到了Dice分数0.88±0.06（白质），相当于该数据集的人工分割可靠性水平，为文献中最高记录。在T1加权图像上性能下降至Dice分数0.58±0.09（白质）。在多中心验证中，模型性能下降明显。

Conclusion: MedNeXt-L-k5提供了一种高效的自动PVS分割方案，特别是在T2加权MRI数据上表现优异。但该模型并未超过nnU-Net，表明Transformer模型中的全局上下文注意机制对于PVS分割的高精度并非必需。

Abstract: Enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS) are increasingly recognized as biomarkers
of cerebral small vessel disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and
aging-related neurodegeneration. However, manual segmentation of PVS is
time-consuming and subject to moderate inter-rater reliability, while existing
automated deep learning models have moderate performance and typically fail to
generalize across diverse clinical and research MRI datasets. We adapted
MedNeXt-L-k5, a Transformer-inspired 3D encoder-decoder convolutional network,
for automated PVS segmentation. Two models were trained: one using a
homogeneous dataset of 200 T2-weighted (T2w) MRI scans from the Human
Connectome Project-Aging (HCP-Aging) dataset and another using 40 heterogeneous
T1-weighted (T1w) MRI volumes from seven studies across six scanners. Model
performance was evaluated using internal 5-fold cross validation (5FCV) and
leave-one-site-out cross validation (LOSOCV). MedNeXt-L-k5 models trained on
the T2w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved voxel-level Dice scores of
0.88+/-0.06 (white matter, WM), comparable to the reported inter-rater
reliability of that dataset, and the highest yet reported in the literature.
The same models trained on the T1w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved a
substantially lower Dice score of 0.58+/-0.09 (WM). Under LOSOCV, the model had
voxel-level Dice scores of 0.38+/-0.16 (WM) and 0.35+/-0.12 (BG), and
cluster-level Dice scores of 0.61+/-0.19 (WM) and 0.62+/-0.21 (BG).
MedNeXt-L-k5 provides an efficient solution for automated PVS segmentation
across diverse T1w and T2w MRI datasets. MedNeXt-L-k5 did not outperform the
nnU-Net, indicating that the attention-based mechanisms present in
transformer-inspired models to provide global context are not required for high
accuracy in PVS segmentation.

*Zhixiang Chi,Yanan Wu,Li Gu,Huan Liu,Ziqiang Wang,Yang Zhang,Yang Wang,Konstantinos N. Plataniotis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的自适应反馈框架，通过将输出级别的补丁对应关系反馈到中间注意力层，增强CLIP在开放词汇分割中的空间一致性和语义对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在视觉-文本对齐方面表现强劲，但在开放词汇分割中由于定位能力差而表现不佳。先前的方法通过修改中间注意力来增强空间一致性，但由于后续操作（如投影）导致这种一致性无法持续传播到最终输出，且中间注意力缺乏与文本表示的直接交互。

Method: 设计了一个训练免费的反馈驱动自适应框架，包括注意力隔离、基于置信度的稀疏适应剪枝和适应集成等关键模块，将输出预测作为更强的空间一致性先验反馈到中间注意力层。

Result: 该方法作为即插即用模块，无缝集成到四种最先进方法中，在八个基准测试中一致提升了性能，支持三种骨干网络（ViT-B、ViT-L、ViT-H）和多种注意力类型。

Conclusion: 通过利用模型输出作为空间一致性先验，该方法有效增强了内部表示与最终预测之间的语义一致性，显著提升了CLIP在开放词汇分割任务中的表现。

Abstract: CLIP exhibits strong visual-textual alignment but struggle with
open-vocabulary segmentation due to poor localization. Prior methods enhance
spatial coherence by modifying intermediate attention. But, this coherence
isn't consistently propagated to the final output due to subsequent operations
such as projections. Additionally, intermediate attention lacks direct
interaction with text representations, such semantic discrepancy limits the
full potential of CLIP.
  In this work, we propose a training-free, feedback-driven self-adaptive
framework that adapts output-based patch-level correspondences back to the
intermediate attention. The output predictions, being the culmination of the
model's processing, encapsulate the most comprehensive visual and textual
semantics about each patch. Our approach enhances semantic consistency between
internal representations and final predictions by leveraging the model's
outputs as a stronger spatial coherence prior. We design key modules, including
attention isolation, confidence-based pruning for sparse adaptation, and
adaptation ensemble, to effectively feedback the output coherence cues. Our
method functions as a plug-in module, seamlessly integrating into four
state-of-the-art approaches with three backbones (ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H). We
further validate our framework across multiple attention types (Q-K, self-self,
and Proxy augmented with MAE, SAM, and DINO). Our approach consistently
improves their performance across eight benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个探测框架来系统分析多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在不同层次处理视觉和文本输入的方式，发现了模型具有一致的阶段性结构特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在各种视觉语言任务中表现出色，但其内部处理机制尚未得到充分探索，需要系统性的分析框架来理解其表示动态。

Method: 训练线性分类器从各层token嵌入中预测细粒度视觉类别，使用标准化锚点问题，并通过三种提示变体（词汇变体、语义否定变体、输出格式变体）评估探测结果。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5、LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3和Qwen2-VL模型中发现一致的阶段性结构：早期层进行视觉接地，中间层支持词汇整合和语义推理，最终层准备任务特定输出。

Conclusion: 该研究为MLLMs的层次组织提供了统一视角，并提供了轻量级、模型无关的方法来分析多模态表示动态，有助于理解模型内部工作机制。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet their internal processing
dynamics remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce a probing framework
to systematically analyze how MLLMs process visual and textual inputs across
layers. We train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories
(e.g., dog breeds) from token embeddings extracted at each layer, using a
standardized anchor question. To uncover the functional roles of different
layers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt
variations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level
changes, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by
modifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that
preserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to
LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent
stage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle
layers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers
prepare task-specific outputs. We further show that while the overall
stage-wise structure remains stable across variations in visual tokenization,
instruction tuning data, and pretraining corpus, the specific layer allocation
to each stage shifts notably with changes in the base LLM architecture. Our
findings provide a unified perspective on the layer-wise organization of MLLMs
and offer a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for analyzing multimodal
representation dynamics.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种监督式字典学习方法SLiCS，通过稀疏线性概念子空间对视觉-语言共嵌入空间进行解耦，将嵌入分解为多个概念特定的分量向量，实现更精确的概念过滤图像检索和条件生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 假设视觉-语言共嵌入空间（如CLIP）可以被解耦，将复杂场景的内容信息分离到不同的概念特定子空间中，从而提升下游任务的性能。

Method: 采用监督式字典学习方法，估计一个线性合成模型，包含稀疏、非负的字典向量组合，通过新颖的交替优化算法保证收敛，并利用文本共嵌入进行语义描述和零样本分类。

Result: SLiCS方法在概念过滤图像检索方面表现出更高的精确度，适用于多种嵌入空间（TiTok压缩自编码器嵌入和DINOv2自监督嵌入），定量和定性结果均显示性能提升。

Conclusion: 通过稀疏线性概念子空间解耦嵌入空间，能够有效分离不同概念信息，提升图像检索和条件生成的精确度，为多模态表示学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision-language co-embedding networks, such as CLIP, provide a latent
embedding space with semantic information that is useful for downstream tasks.
We hypothesize that the embedding space can be disentangled to separate the
information on the content of complex scenes by decomposing the embedding into
multiple concept-specific component vectors that lie in different subspaces. We
propose a supervised dictionary learning approach to estimate a linear
synthesis model consisting of sparse, non-negative combinations of groups of
vectors in the dictionary (atoms), whose group-wise activity matches the
multi-label information. Each concept-specific component is a non-negative
combination of atoms associated to a label. The group-structured dictionary is
optimized through a novel alternating optimization with guaranteed convergence.
Exploiting the text co-embeddings, we detail how semantically meaningful
descriptions can be found based on text embeddings of words best approximated
by a concept's group of atoms, and unsupervised dictionary learning can exploit
zero-shot classification of training set images using the text embeddings of
concept labels to provide instance-wise multi-labels. We show that the
disentangled embeddings provided by our sparse linear concept subspaces (SLiCS)
enable concept-filtered image retrieval (and conditional generation using
image-to-prompt) that is more precise. We also apply SLiCS to highly-compressed
autoencoder embeddings from TiTok and the latent embedding from self-supervised
DINOv2. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight the improved precision
of the concept-filtered image retrieval for all embeddings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗视觉语言模型在临床应用中有巨大潜力，但存在严重的隐私安全风险，如受保护健康信息泄露、数据泄漏和网络威胁，特别是在医院环境中。需要一种安全易用的部署方案。

Method: 开发了MedFoundationHub图形用户界面工具包，支持医生手动选择模型无需编程，工程师可插件式部署Hugging Face开源模型，通过Docker编排实现跨操作系统隐私保护推理，仅需单块NVIDIA A6000 GPU的离线工作站。

Result: 评估了5个最先进的VLM模型（Google-MedGemma3-4B等），由认证病理学家对结肠和肾脏病例进行1015次临床评分，发现模型存在脱靶回答、模糊推理和病理术语不一致等局限性。

Conclusion: MedFoundationHub提供了一个安全、易用的医疗VLM部署解决方案，但当前模型仍存在显著局限性，需要在临床应用中谨慎使用并持续改进。

Abstract: Recent advances in medical vision-language models (VLMs) open up remarkable
opportunities for clinical applications such as automated report generation,
copilots for physicians, and uncertainty quantification. However, despite their
promise, medical VLMs introduce serious security concerns, most notably risks
of Protected Health Information (PHI) exposure, data leakage, and vulnerability
to cyberthreats - which are especially critical in hospital environments. Even
when adopted for research or non-clinical purposes, healthcare organizations
must exercise caution and implement safeguards. To address these challenges, we
present MedFoundationHub, a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit that: (1)
enables physicians to manually select and use different models without
programming expertise, (2) supports engineers in efficiently deploying medical
VLMs in a plug-and-play fashion, with seamless integration of Hugging Face
open-source models, and (3) ensures privacy-preserving inference through
Docker-orchestrated, operating system agnostic deployment. MedFoundationHub
requires only an offline local workstation equipped with a single NVIDIA A6000
GPU, making it both secure and accessible within the typical resources of
academic research labs. To evaluate current capabilities, we engaged
board-certified pathologists to deploy and assess five state-of-the-art VLMs
(Google-MedGemma3-4B, Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, and
LLaVA-1.5-7B/13B). Expert evaluation covered colon cases and renal cases,
yielding 1015 clinician-model scoring events. These assessments revealed
recurring limitations, including off-target answers, vague reasoning, and
inconsistent pathology terminology.

Motivation: 多任务密集预测中充分的跨任务交互至关重要，但现有方法面临交互完整性与计算效率之间的权衡限制

Method: 引入双向交互扫描（BI-Scan）机制构建任务特定表示作为双向序列，结合任务优先和位置优先扫描模式；采用多尺度扫描（MS-Scan）机制实现多粒度场景建模

Result: 在NYUD-V2和PASCAL-Context基准测试中表现出优于最先进竞争方法的性能

Conclusion: BIM模型通过创新的扫描机制成功解决了多任务密集预测中的交互效率问题，实现了更好的性能表现

Abstract: Sufficient cross-task interaction is crucial for success in multi-task dense
prediction. However, sufficient interaction often results in high computational
complexity, forcing existing methods to face the trade-off between interaction
completeness and computational efficiency. To address this limitation, this
work proposes a Bidirectional Interaction Mamba (BIM), which incorporates novel
scanning mechanisms to adapt the Mamba modeling approach for multi-task dense
prediction. On the one hand, we introduce a novel Bidirectional Interaction
Scan (BI-Scan) mechanism, which constructs task-specific representations as
bidirectional sequences during interaction. By integrating task-first and
position-first scanning modes within a unified linear complexity architecture,
BI-Scan efficiently preserves critical cross-task information. On the other
hand, we employ a Multi-Scale Scan~(MS-Scan) mechanism to achieve
multi-granularity scene modeling. This design not only meets the diverse
granularity requirements of various tasks but also enhances nuanced cross-task
feature interactions. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks,
\emph{i.e.}, NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context, show the superiority of our BIM vs its
state-of-the-art competitors.

Motivation: 现有的文本指导编辑方法在复杂场景中存在限制，需要额外的非文本编辑提示来充分描述编辑意图。同时，现有音频指导方法通常需要特定数据集训练来对齐音频和文本，限制了其在真实场景中的通用性。

Method: 利用预训练的多模态编码器（具有强大的零样本能力），通过消除音频编码器空间与模型提示编码器空间之间的差异来集成多样化音频。还提出了分离噪声分支和适应性片选择来处理复杂的多模态编辑提示。

Result: 在多样化编辑任务上进行了全面实验，证明该框架能够通过融合音频的丰富信息来处理复杂的编辑场景，而仅依靠文本的方法则无法完成。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种无需额外训练的音频指导视觉编辑方案，能够有效处理复杂的多模态编辑任务，为多模态编辑领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual editing with diffusion models has made significant progress but often
struggles with complex scenarios that textual guidance alone could not
adequately describe, highlighting the need for additional non-text editing
prompts. In this work, we introduce a novel audio-guided visual editing
framework that can handle complex editing tasks with multiple text and audio
prompts without requiring additional training. Existing audio-guided visual
editing methods often necessitate training on specific datasets to align audio
with text, limiting their generalization to real-world situations. We leverage
a pre-trained multi-modal encoder with strong zero-shot capabilities and
integrate diverse audio into visual editing tasks, by alleviating the
discrepancy between the audio encoder space and the diffusion model's prompt
encoder space. Additionally, we propose a novel approach to handle complex
scenarios with multiple and multi-modal editing prompts through our separate
noise branching and adaptive patch selection. Our comprehensive experiments on
diverse editing tasks demonstrate that our framework excels in handling
complicated editing scenarios by incorporating rich information from audio,
where text-only approaches fail.

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的大量实验表明，该框架显著推进了多标签分类，达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: AEVLP框架通过GPR损失和DAMP技术有效解决了SPML中的噪声问题，在多标签分类任务中表现出色

Abstract: Multi-label learning is a challenging computer vision task that requires
assigning multiple categories to each image. However, fully annotating
large-scale datasets is often impractical due to high costs and effort,
motivating the study of learning from partially annotated data. In the extreme
case of Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPML), each image is provided
with only one positive label, while all other labels remain unannotated.
Traditional SPML methods that treat missing labels as unknown or negative tend
to yield inaccuracies and false negatives, and integrating various
pseudo-labeling strategies can introduce additional noise. To address these
challenges, we propose the Generalized Pseudo-Label Robust Loss (GPR Loss), a
novel loss function that effectively learns from diverse pseudo-labels while
mitigating noise. Complementing this, we introduce a simple yet effective
Dynamic Augmented Multi-focus Pseudo-labeling (DAMP) technique. Together, these
contributions form the Adaptive and Efficient Vision-Language Pseudo-Labeling
(AEVLP) framework. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our framework significantly advances multi-label classification, achieving
state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: 方法能够在更低的时间步下实现更精确的特征表示，使刻刻神经网络在保持传统IF神经元能耗的同时，实现高性能和超低延迟的视觉检测。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the brain, are characterized by
minimal power consumption and swift inference capabilities on neuromorphic
hardware, and have been widely applied to various visual perception tasks.
Current ANN-SNN conversion methods have achieved excellent results in
classification tasks with ultra-low time-steps, but their performance in visual
detection tasks remains suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a delay-spike
approach to mitigate the issue of residual membrane potential caused by
heterogeneous spiking patterns. Furthermore, we propose a novel
temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron architecture for SNNs. This
enables Integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons to dynamically adjust their
accumulation and firing behaviors based on the temporal order of time-steps.
Our method enables spikes to exhibit distinct temporal properties, rather than
relying solely on frequency-based representations. Moreover, the tdIF neuron
maintains energy consumption on par with traditional IF neuron. We demonstrate
that our method achieves more precise feature representation with lower
time-steps, enabling high performance and ultra-low latency in visual detection
tasks. In this study, we conduct extensive evaluation of the tdIF method across
two critical vision tasks: object detection and lane line detection. The
results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses current ANN-SNN
conversion approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance with ultra-low
latency (within 5 time-steps).

TL;DR: 提出DUP-MCRNet网络，通过动态不确定性传播和多模态协同推理解决显著目标检测中的细节丢失、边缘模糊和多模态信息融合不足问题，在多个基准数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有显著目标检测方法在复杂场景中容易丢失细节、边缘模糊，且单模态信息融合不足，需要提升对复杂背景的鲁棒性和边缘清晰度。

Method: 设计动态不确定性图卷积模块(DUGC)通过空间语义距离构建稀疏图传播不确定性；提出多模态协同融合策略(MCF)使用可学习模态门控权重融合RGB、深度和边缘特征；采用多尺度BCE和IoU损失、跨尺度一致性约束和不确定性引导监督机制优化检测性能。

Result: 在大多数常见基准数据集上优于各种SOD方法，特别是在边缘清晰度和对复杂背景的鲁棒性方面表现突出。

Conclusion: DUP-MCRNet通过动态不确定性传播和多模态协同推理有效提升了显著目标检测的精度和鲁棒性，特别是在处理复杂场景和小结构检测方面具有优势。

Abstract: In view of the problems that existing salient object detection (SOD) methods
are prone to losing details, blurring edges, and insufficient fusion of
single-modal information in complex scenes, this paper proposes a dynamic
uncertainty propagation and multimodal collaborative reasoning network
(DUP-MCRNet). Firstly, a dynamic uncertainty graph convolution module (DUGC) is
designed to propagate uncertainty between layers through a sparse graph
constructed based on spatial semantic distance, and combined with channel
adaptive interaction, it effectively improves the detection accuracy of small
structures and edge regions. Secondly, a multimodal collaborative fusion
strategy (MCF) is proposed, which uses learnable modality gating weights to
weightedly fuse the attention maps of RGB, depth, and edge features. It can
dynamically adjust the importance of each modality according to different
scenes, effectively suppress redundant or interfering information, and
strengthen the semantic complementarity and consistency between
cross-modalities, thereby improving the ability to identify salient regions
under occlusion, weak texture or background interference. Finally, the
detection performance at the pixel level and region level is optimized through
multi-scale BCE and IoU loss, cross-scale consistency constraints, and
uncertainty-guided supervision mechanisms. Extensive experiments show that
DUP-MCRNet outperforms various SOD methods on most common benchmark datasets,
especially in terms of edge clarity and robustness to complex backgrounds. Our

TL;DR: 提出MSMVD方法，通过多尺度BEV特征解决多视角行人检测中尺度不一致问题，在GMVD数据集上MODA指标提升4.5点


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端深度学习方法在多视角行人检测中难以处理视角内尺度一致偏小/偏大以及视角间尺度差异大的行人检测问题，因为它们没有充分利用多尺度图像特征

Method: MSMVD方法：1) 从各视角提取多尺度图像特征并逐尺度投影到BEV空间生成多尺度BEV特征；2) 使用特征金字塔网络处理多尺度BEV特征，融合多视角不同尺度信息

Result: 实验证明利用多尺度图像特征通过多尺度BEV特征显著提升检测性能，在GMVD数据集上MODA指标比之前最佳方法提高4.5点

Conclusion: 多尺度BEV特征生成和融合能有效解决多视角行人检测中的尺度不一致问题，大幅提升检测精度

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Detection (MVPD) aims to detect pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view (BEV) from multi-view images. In MVPD, end-to-end
trainable deep learning methods have progressed greatly. However, they often
struggle to detect pedestrians with consistently small or large scales in views
or with vastly different scales between views. This is because they do not
exploit multi-scale image features to generate the BEV feature and detect
pedestrians. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel MVPD method, called
Multi-Scale Multi-View Detection (MSMVD). MSMVD generates multi-scale BEV
features by projecting multi-scale image features extracted from individual
views into the BEV space, scale-by-scale. Each of these BEV features inherits
the properties of its corresponding scale image features from multiple views.
Therefore, these BEV features help the precise detection of pedestrians with
consistently small or large scales in views. Then, MSMVD combines information
at different scales of multiple views by processing the multi-scale BEV
features using a feature pyramid network. This improves the detection of
pedestrians with vastly different scales between views. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that exploiting multi-scale image features via multi-scale BEV
features greatly improves the detection performance, and MSMVD outperforms the
previous highest MODA by $4.5$ points on the GMVD dataset.

TL;DR: 提出轻量级实时深度伪造检测网络SFMFNet，通过空间-频率混合感知模块和多尺度特征融合，在保持高精度的同时显著降低计算成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度伪造检测器计算成本高，难以在视频会议和社交媒体等实时应用中部署，需要开发轻量高效的检测方案

Method: 设计空间-频率混合感知模块（结合空间纹理和频率伪影）、令牌选择性交叉注意力机制、残差增强模糊池化结构

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现了准确性和效率的良好平衡，具有强泛化能力和实时应用价值

Conclusion: SFMFNet为实时深度伪造检测提供了有效的轻量级解决方案，在保持检测精度的同时显著提升了计算效率

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of real-time deepfake generation techniques,
forged content is becoming increasingly realistic and widespread across
applications like video conferencing and social media. Although
state-of-the-art detectors achieve high accuracy on standard benchmarks, their
heavy computational cost hinders real-time deployment in practical
applications. To address this, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Aware
Multi-Scale Fusion Network (SFMFNet), a lightweight yet effective architecture
for real-time deepfake detection. We design a spatial-frequency hybrid aware
module that jointly leverages spatial textures and frequency artifacts through
a gated mechanism, enhancing sensitivity to subtle manipulations. A
token-selective cross attention mechanism enables efficient multi-level feature
interaction, while a residual-enhanced blur pooling structure helps retain key
semantic cues during downsampling. Experiments on several benchmark datasets
show that SFMFNet achieves a favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency,
with strong generalization and practical value for real-time applications.

TL;DR: 提出结合双模型权重选择与自知识蒸馏的轻量级医学图像分类方法，在保持计算效率的同时达到与大模型相当的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学图像分类中大规模模型部署受计算资源限制的问题，需要开发既轻量又高性能的模型

Method: 使用双模型权重选择策略从大型预训练模型初始化两个轻量模型，然后应用自知识蒸馏进行知识迁移，最后针对目标任务进行微调

Result: 在胸部X光、肺部CT和脑部MRI等多个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比现有方法具有更优的性能和鲁棒性

Conclusion: 双模型权重选择与自知识蒸馏的结合有效克服了传统方法在紧凑模型中保留关键信息的局限性，为医学图像分类提供了高效的解决方案

Abstract: We propose a novel medical image classification method that integrates
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation (SKD). In
real-world medical settings, deploying large-scale models is often limited by
computational resource constraints, which pose significant challenges for their
practical implementation. Thus, developing lightweight models that achieve
comparable performance to large-scale models while maintaining computational
efficiency is crucial. To address this, we employ a dual-model weight selection
strategy that initializes two lightweight models with weights derived from a
large pretrained model, enabling effective knowledge transfer. Next, SKD is
applied to these selected models, allowing the use of a broad range of initial
weight configurations without imposing additional excessive computational cost,
followed by fine-tuning for the target classification tasks. By combining
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation, our method
overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches, which often fail to
retain critical information in compact models. Extensive experiments on
publicly available datasets-chest X-ray images, lung computed tomography scans,
and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans-demonstrate the superior performance
and robustness of our approach compared to existing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于几何重稠密化和跨尺度特征传播的LiDAR点云压缩方法，在保持轻量级预测头的同时实现高效上下文建模，在KITTI数据集上达到最先进的压缩比和实时性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将无序点云转换为层次化的八叉树或体素结构进行稠密到稀疏的预测编码，但几何细节的极端稀疏性阻碍了高效的上下文建模，限制了压缩性能和速度。

Method: 提出包含两个轻量级模块的框架：1)几何重稠密化模块对编码的稀疏几何进行重稠密化，在更稠密尺度提取特征后重新稀疏化用于预测编码；2)跨尺度特征传播模块利用多分辨率级别的占用线索指导层次特征传播，实现跨尺度信息共享。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上实现了最先进的压缩比和实时性能，在12位量化下编码和解码均达到26 FPS。

Conclusion: 通过整合两个模块生成紧凑特征表示，提供高效上下文建模并加速编码过程，解决了LiDAR点云压缩中稀疏性带来的挑战。

Abstract: LiDAR point clouds are fundamental to various applications, yet
high-precision scans incur substantial storage and transmission overhead.
Existing methods typically convert unordered points into hierarchical octree or
voxel structures for dense-to-sparse predictive coding. However, the extreme
sparsity of geometric details hinders efficient context modeling, thereby
limiting their compression performance and speed. To address this challenge, we
propose to generate compact features for efficient predictive coding. Our
framework comprises two lightweight modules. First, the Geometry
Re-Densification Module re-densifies encoded sparse geometry, extracts features
at denser scale, and then re-sparsifies the features for predictive coding.
This module avoids costly computation on highly sparse details while
maintaining a lightweight prediction head. Second, the Cross-scale Feature
Propagation Module leverages occupancy cues from multiple resolution levels to
guide hierarchical feature propagation. This design facilitates information
sharing across scales, thereby reducing redundant feature extraction and
providing enriched features for the Geometry Re-Densification Module. By
integrating these two modules, our method yields a compact feature
representation that provides efficient context modeling and accelerates the
coding process. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art
compression ratios and real-time performance, achieving 26 FPS for both
encoding and decoding at 12-bit quantization. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D领域面临数据稀缺问题，相比文本、图像和视频，互联网上的3D数据量较少。视频数据包含丰富的空间一致性先验和语义信息，可以作为替代监督信号来缓解3D生成中的泛化瓶颈。

Method: 构建了首个大规模多视角标注视频数据集Droplet3D-4M，并训练了支持图像和密集文本输入的生成模型Droplet3D，利用视频中的空间一致性先验和语义信息进行3D资产生成。

Conclusion: 视频中的常识先验显著促进了3D创作，为解决3D数据稀缺问题提供了有效途径。所有资源包括数据集、代码、技术框架和模型权重均已开源。

Abstract: Scaling laws have validated the success and promise of large-data-trained
models in creative generation across text, image, and video domains. However,
this paradigm faces data scarcity in the 3D domain, as there is far less of it
available on the internet compared to the aforementioned modalities.
Fortunately, there exist adequate videos that inherently contain commonsense
priors, offering an alternative supervisory signal to mitigate the
generalization bottleneck caused by limited native 3D data. On the one hand,
videos capturing multiple views of an object or scene provide a spatial
consistency prior for 3D generation. On the other hand, the rich semantic
information contained within the videos enables the generated content to be
more faithful to the text prompts and semantically plausible. This paper
explores how to apply the video modality in 3D asset generation, spanning
datasets to models. We introduce Droplet3D-4M, the first large-scale video
dataset with multi-view level annotations, and train Droplet3D, a generative
model supporting both image and dense text input. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to
produce spatially consistent and semantically plausible content. Moreover, in
contrast to the prevailing 3D solutions, our approach exhibits the potential
for extension to scene-level applications. This indicates that the commonsense
priors from the videos significantly facilitate 3D creation. We have
open-sourced all resources including the dataset, code, technical framework,
and model weights: https://dropletx.github.io/.

Motivation: 自动驾驶系统的训练和验证需要大量极端场景数据，但真实世界采集成本高且危险。现有基于3D高斯溅射或图像生成模型的方法存在视觉保真度有限和姿态控制不精确的问题

Method: 使用编辑对象的3D高斯表示作为密集先验注入去噪过程，采用场景级3D边界框布局重建非目标对象的遮挡区域，并引入层次化细粒度特征指导编辑对象的外观细节

Conclusion: G^2Editor提供了一个统一的框架，能够生成逼真且精确的物体编辑结果，同时有益于下游数据驱动任务

Abstract: Corner cases are crucial for training and validating autonomous driving
systems, yet collecting them from the real world is often costly and hazardous.
Editing objects within captured sensor data offers an effective alternative for
generating diverse scenarios, commonly achieved through 3D Gaussian Splatting
or image generative models. However, these approaches often suffer from limited
visual fidelity or imprecise pose control. To address these issues, we propose
G^2Editor, a framework designed for photorealistic and precise object editing
in driving videos. Our method leverages a 3D Gaussian representation of the
edited object as a dense prior, injected into the denoising process to ensure
accurate pose control and spatial consistency. A scene-level 3D bounding box
layout is employed to reconstruct occluded areas of non-target objects.
Furthermore, to guide the appearance details of the edited object, we
incorporate hierarchical fine-grained features as additional conditions during
generation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that G^2Editor
effectively supports object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within a
unified framework, outperforming existing methods in both pose controllability
and visual quality, while also benefiting downstream data-driven tasks.

TL;DR: 通过病理知识领域随机化策略，从健康数据生成合成数据来解决胎儿脑分割中CCD病例数据稀缺问题，实现了更准确的分割和生物标记物提取


<details>

Motivation: 胎儿脑精确分割对评估神经发育至关重要，但胶体肾发育不良(CCD)等稀有病变导致标注数据极其稀缺，限制了深度学习模型的普遍化能力

Method: 提出病理知识领域随机化策略，将CCD病变先验知识嵌入合成数据生成流程，仅依靠健康数据即可模拟多样化的脑部变异

Result: 在248例健康胎儿、26例CCD病例和47例其他脑部病变的群体中，在CCD病例上取得显著改善，同时保持对其他情况的性能。胎胆长度(LCC)估计错误从10.9mm降至0.7mm

Conclusion: 将领域特定的解剖先验知识集成到合成数据流程中，可有效缓解数据稀缺问题，提升对稀有但临床重要病变的分析能力

Abstract: Accurate fetal brain segmentation is crucial for extracting biomarkers and
assessing neurodevelopment, especially in conditions such as corpus callosum
dysgenesis (CCD), which can induce drastic anatomical changes. However, the
rarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of
deep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain
randomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a
synthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations
from healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without
requiring pathological annotations.
  We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with
CCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on
CCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with
other pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically
relevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show
their utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed
augmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in
healthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Beyond these
quantitative gains, our approach yields segmentations with improved topological
consistency relative to available ground truth, enabling more reliable
shape-based analyses. Overall, this work demonstrates that incorporating
domain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can effectively
mitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant
malformations.

Motivation: 传统语音识别系统对聋哑人士不可用，而现有的视觉替代方案（手语和唇读）虽然有效但各自独立研究，缺乏统一的整合框架。

Method: 设计了一个统一的模态无关架构，能够有效处理异质输入，并探索了模态间的协同作用，特别是唇部运动作为手语理解中的非手动线索的作用。

Result: 在SLT、VSR、ASR和AVSR任务上达到或优于任务专用最先进模型，分析显示将唇部运动作为独立模态显着提升手语翻译性能。

Conclusion: 该统一框架成功整合多种模态，证明了模态间协同的重要性，特别是唇部运动对手语理解的显著提升作用，为无障碍通信技术提供了新方向。

Abstract: Audio is the primary modality for human communication and has driven the
success of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies. However, such
systems remain inherently inaccessible to individuals who are deaf or hard of
hearing. Visual alternatives such as sign language and lip reading offer
effective substitutes, and recent advances in Sign Language Translation (SLT)
and Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) have improved audio-less communication.
Yet, these modalities have largely been studied in isolation, and their
integration within a unified framework remains underexplored. In this paper, we
introduce the first unified framework capable of handling diverse combinations
of sign language, lip movements, and audio for spoken-language text generation.
We focus on three main objectives: (i) designing a unified, modality-agnostic
architecture capable of effectively processing heterogeneous inputs; (ii)
exploring the underexamined synergy among modalities, particularly the role of
lip movements as non-manual cues in sign language comprehension; and (iii)
achieving performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art models
specialized for individual tasks. Building on this framework, we achieve
performance on par with or better than task-specific state-of-the-art models
across SLT, VSR, ASR, and AVSR. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that
explicitly modeling lip movements as a separate modality significantly improves
SLT performance.

Conclusion: Video-MTR通过多轮迭代推理和双层次奖励机制，有效解决了长视频理解中的长程时序依赖和多事件处理问题，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Long-form video understanding, characterized by long-range temporal
dependencies and multiple events, remains a challenge. Existing methods often
rely on static reasoning or external visual-language models (VLMs), which face
issues like complexity and sub-optimal performance due to the lack of
end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose Video-MTR, a reinforced
multi-turn reasoning framework designed to enable iterative key video segment
selection and question comprehension. Unlike traditional video reasoning
pipeline, which generate predictions in a single turn, Video-MTR performs
reasoning in multiple turns, selecting video segments progressively based on
the evolving understanding of previously processed segments and the current
question. This iterative process allows for a more refined and contextually
aware analysis of the video. To ensure intermediate reasoning process, we
introduce a novel gated bi-level reward system, combining trajectory-level
rewards based on answer correctness and turn-level rewards emphasizing
frame-query relevance. This system optimizes both video segment selection and
question comprehension, eliminating the need for external VLMs and allowing
end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like VideoMME, MLVU,
and EgoSchema demonstrate that Video-MTR outperforms existing methods in both
accuracy and efficiency, advancing the state-of-the-art in long video
understanding.

Abstract: Accurate monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) is pivotal for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, yet its reliability deteriorates
significantly under real-world domain shifts caused by environmental or sensor
variations. To address these shifts, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods have
emerged, enabling models to adapt to target distributions during inference.
While prior TTA approaches recognize the positive correlation between low
uncertainty and high generalization ability, they fail to address the dual
uncertainty inherent to M3OD: semantic uncertainty (ambiguous class
predictions) and geometric uncertainty (unstable spatial localization). To
bridge this gap, we propose Dual Uncertainty Optimization (DUO), the first TTA
framework designed to jointly minimize both uncertainties for robust M3OD.
Through a convex optimization lens, we introduce an innovative convex structure
of the focal loss and further derive a novel unsupervised version, enabling
label-agnostic uncertainty weighting and balanced learning for high-uncertainty
objects. In parallel, we design a semantic-aware normal field constraint that
preserves geometric coherence in regions with clear semantic cues, reducing
uncertainty from the unstable 3D representation. This dual-branch mechanism
forms a complementary loop: enhanced spatial perception improves semantic
classification, and robust semantic predictions further refine spatial
understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DUO over
existing methods across various datasets and domain shift types.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to more studies to enhance golfers'
shot precision. However, these existing studies have not quantitatively
established the relationship between swing posture and ball trajectory,
limiting their ability to provide golfers with the necessary insights for swing
improvement. In this paper, we propose a new dataset called CaddieSet, which
includes joint information and various ball information from a single shot.
CaddieSet extracts joint information from a single swing video by segmenting it
into eight swing phases using a computer vision-based approach. Furthermore,
based on expert golf domain knowledge, we define 15 key metrics that influence
a golf swing, enabling the interpretation of swing outcomes through
swing-related features. Through experiments, we demonstrated the feasibility of
CaddieSet for predicting ball trajectories using various benchmarks. In
particular, we focus on interpretable models among several benchmarks and
verify that swing feedback using our joint features is quantitatively
consistent with established domain knowledge. This work is expected to offer
new insight into golf swing analysis for both academia and the sports industry.

Conclusion: IAENet通过有效融合2D预训练专家和3D专家模型的集体智慧，同时保持各自的独特优势，为3D点云表面异常检测提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Surface anomaly detection is pivotal for ensuring product quality in
industrial manufacturing. While 2D image-based methods have achieved remarkable
success, 3D point cloud-based detection remains underexplored despite its
richer geometric cues. We argue that the key bottleneck is the absence of
powerful pretrained foundation backbones in 3D comparable to those in 2D. To
bridge this gap, we propose Importance-Aware Ensemble Network (IAENet), an
ensemble framework that synergizes 2D pretrained expert with 3D expert models.
However, naively fusing predictions from disparate sources is non-trivial:
existing strategies can be affected by a poorly performing modality and thus
degrade overall accuracy. To address this challenge, We introduce an novel
Importance-Aware Fusion (IAF) module that dynamically assesses the contribution
of each source and reweights their anomaly scores. Furthermore, we devise
critical loss functions that explicitly guide the optimization of IAF, enabling
it to combine the collective knowledge of the source experts but also preserve
their unique strengths, thereby enhancing the overall performance of anomaly
detection. Extensive experiments on MVTec 3D-AD demonstrate that our IAENet
achieves a new state-of-the-art with a markedly lower false positive rate,
underscoring its practical value for industrial deployment.

Conclusion: DescriptiveEdit框架通过重新定义问题为基于参考图像的文本到图像生成，克服了现有方法的局限性，具有更好的可扩展性和编辑效果。

Abstract: Despite the progress in text-to-image generation, semantic image editing
remains a challenge. Inversion-based algorithms unavoidably introduce
reconstruction errors, while instruction-based models mainly suffer from
limited dataset quality and scale. To address these problems, we propose a
descriptive-prompt-based editing framework, named DescriptiveEdit. The core
idea is to re-frame `instruction-based image editing' as `reference-image-based
text-to-image generation', which preserves the generative power of well-trained
Text-to-Image models without architectural modifications or inversion.
Specifically, taking the reference image and a prompt as input, we introduce a
Cross-Attentive UNet, which newly adds attention bridges to inject reference
image features into the prompt-to-edit-image generation process. Owing to its
text-to-image nature, DescriptiveEdit overcomes limitations in instruction
dataset quality, integrates seamlessly with ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and other
extensions, and is more scalable. Experiments on the Emu Edit benchmark show it

*Wenting Yin,Han Sun,Xinru Meng,Ningzhong Liu,Huiyu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCFS是一个新颖的持续测试时适应框架，通过双路径特征一致性和置信度感知样本学习来解决伪标签质量问题和错误累积问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无法访问源域数据的情况下，现有方法依赖模型预测生成伪标签，但伪标签质量无法保证且存在错误累积问题，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 使用双分类器将目标数据特征解耦为语义相关特征和域相关特征，保持子特征与整体特征的一致性，并设置自适应阈值进行置信度加权的自监督学习。

Result: 在CIFAR10-C、CIFAR100-C和ImageNet-C等多个数据集上的广泛实验验证了该方法的有效性，在持续测试时适应场景中表现出稳定的性能。

Conclusion: DCFS框架通过特征解耦和置信度感知学习，能够从多角度全面捕捉数据特征，有效减少伪标签噪声并缓解错误累积问题。

Abstract: Continual test-time adaptation aims to continuously adapt a pre-trained model
to a stream of target domain data without accessing source data. Without access
to source domain data, the model focuses solely on the feature characteristics
of the target data. Relying exclusively on these features can lead to confusion
and introduce learning biases. Currently, many existing methods generate
pseudo-labels via model predictions. However, the quality of pseudo-labels
cannot be guaranteed and the problem of error accumulation must be solved. To
address these challenges, we propose DCFS, a novel CTTA framework that
introduces dual-path feature consistency and confidence-aware sample learning.
This framework disentangles the whole feature representation of the target data
into semantic-related feature and domain-related feature using dual classifiers
to learn distinct feature representations. By maintaining consistency between
the sub-features and the whole feature, the model can comprehensively capture
data features from multiple perspectives. Additionally, to ensure that the
whole feature information of the target domain samples is not overlooked, we
set a adaptive threshold and calculate a confidence score for each sample to
carry out loss weighted self-supervised learning, effectively reducing the
noise of pseudo-labels and alleviating the problem of error accumulation. The
efficacy of our proposed method is validated through extensive experimentation
across various datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C,
demonstrating consistent performance in continual test-time adaptation
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机标定质量对新视角合成致关重要，但真实场景缺乏真实标定地面真值，需要通过合成质量来评估标定效果

Method: 利用3DGS模型，通过回传新视角颜色损失对相机参数进行细调优化

Result: 在3DGS参考数据集上平均提升0.4 dB PSNR，显著改善新视角合成质量

Conclusion: 虽然细调过程耗时，但对于重要场景的标定，这种方法在提升新视角质量方面具有重要价值

Abstract: The quality of the camera calibration is of major importance for evaluating
progresses in novel view synthesis, as a 1-pixel error on the calibration has a
significant impact on the reconstruction quality. While there is no ground
truth for real scenes, the quality of the calibration is assessed by the
quality of the novel view synthesis. This paper proposes to use a 3DGS model to
fine tune calibration by backpropagation of novel view color loss with respect
to the cameras parameters. The new calibration alone brings an average
improvement of 0.4 dB PSNR on the dataset used as reference by 3DGS. The fine
tuning may be long and its suitability depends on the criticity of training
time, but for calibration of reference scenes, such as Mip-NeRF 360, the stake
of novel view quality is the most important.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Accurate gross tumor volume segmentation on multi-modal medical data is
critical for radiotherapy planning in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and
glioblastoma. Recent advances in deep neural networks have brought promising
results in medical image segmentation, leading to an increasing demand for
labeled data. Since labeling medical images is time-consuming and
labor-intensive, active learning has emerged as a solution to reduce annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples to label and adapting
high-performance models with as few labeled samples as possible. Previous
active domain adaptation (ADA) methods seek to minimize sample redundancy by
selecting samples that are farthest from the source domain. However, such
one-off selection can easily cause negative transfer, and access to source
medical data is often limited. Moreover, the query strategy for multi-modal
medical data remains unexplored. In this work, we propose an active and
sequential domain adaptation framework for dynamic multi-modal sample selection
in ADA. We derive a query strategy to prioritize labeling and training on the
most valuable samples based on their informativeness and representativeness.
Empirical validation on diverse gross tumor volume segmentation tasks
demonstrates that our method achieves favorable segmentation performance,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art ADA methods. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 一种新的数据级融合框架，通过早期融合LiDAR和RGB图像数据，利用视觉基础模型进行实例分割和深度估计，通过双向融合和迭代精炼伪标签框，实现了更高质量的无监督3D物体检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无监督3D检测方法仅简单融合LiDAR和RGB图像生成的伪标签框，忽视了两种数据源在补充性上的价值，导致伪标签框质量提升有限。手动标注3D标签耗时耗力，需要更有效的无监督方法。

Method: 提出数据级融合框架：1)利用视觉基础模型进行实例分割和深度估计；2)双向融合策略：3D点云获取2D类别标签，2D像素投影3D提升点密度；3)局部和全局筛波消除深度估计和分割噪声；4)动态自我迭代策略迭代精炼伪标签框。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上验证集进行了大量实验，该方法训练的检测器显著超过了之前的最新方法，达到了28.4%的mAP指标。

Conclusion: 通过早期数据级融合、双向信息交换和迭代精炼策略，该方法能够生成质量更高的伪标签框，为无监督3D物体检测提供了有效的解决方案，在减少人工标注工作量的同时提高了检测性能。

Abstract: Existing LiDAR-based 3D object detectors typically rely on manually annotated
labels for training to achieve good performance. However, obtaining
high-quality 3D labels is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this
issue, recent works explore unsupervised 3D object detection by introducing RGB
images as an auxiliary modal to assist pseudo-box generation. However, these
methods simply integrate pseudo-boxes generated by LiDAR point clouds and RGB
images. Yet, such a label-level fusion strategy brings limited improvements to
the quality of pseudo-boxes, as it overlooks the complementary nature in terms
of LiDAR and RGB image data. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a
novel data-level fusion framework that integrates RGB images and LiDAR data at
an early stage. Specifically, we utilize vision foundation models for instance
segmentation and depth estimation on images and introduce a bi-directional
fusion method, where real points acquire category labels from the 2D space,
while 2D pixels are projected onto 3D to enhance real point density. To
mitigate noise from depth and segmentation estimations, we propose a local and
global filtering method, which applies local radius filtering to suppress depth
estimation errors and global statistical filtering to remove
segmentation-induced outliers. Furthermore, we propose a data-level fusion
based dynamic self-evolution strategy, which iteratively refines pseudo-boxes
under a dense representation, significantly improving localization accuracy.
Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the detector
trained by our method significantly outperforms that trained by previous
state-of-the-art methods with 28.4$\%$ mAP on the nuScenes validation
benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在远程医疗或紧急情况下，传统BMI测量方法不可用或不切实际，需要从相机图像中快速估计BMI的机器学习方法。现有计算机视觉方法受限于较小数据集（最多14,500张图像）。

Conclusion: 该方法在BMI估计方面取得了最先进的性能，展示了强大的泛化能力，并通过开源代码和移动部署框架为研究社区提供了完整的解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating Body Mass Index (BMI) from camera images with machine learning
models enables rapid weight assessment when traditional methods are unavailable
or impractical, such as in telehealth or emergency scenarios. Existing computer
vision approaches have been limited to datasets of up to 14,500 images. In this
study, we present a deep learning-based BMI estimation method trained on our
WayBED dataset, a large proprietary collection of 84,963 smartphone images from
25,353 individuals. We introduce an automatic filtering method that uses
posture clustering and person detection to curate the dataset by removing
low-quality images, such as those with atypical postures or incomplete views.
This process retained 71,322 high-quality images suitable for training. We
achieve a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 7.9% on our hold-out test
set (WayBED data) using full-body images, the lowest value in the published
literature to the best of our knowledge. Further, we achieve a MAPE of 13% on
the completely unseen~(during training) VisualBodyToBMI dataset, comparable
with state-of-the-art approaches trained on it, demonstrating robust
generalization. Lastly, we fine-tune our model on VisualBodyToBMI and achieve a
MAPE of 8.56%, the lowest reported value on this dataset so far. We deploy the
full pipeline, including image filtering and BMI estimation, on Android devices
using the CLAID framework. We release our complete code for model training,
filtering, and the CLAID package for mobile deployment as open-source
contributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 域适应技术能缓解训练集和测试集之间的分布差异，但现有研究多基于自然图像，医学图像应用较少且主流数据集存在性能偏差。为更好理解域适应在自然和医学图像中的效益，需要系统评估。

Method: 使用7种广泛应用的域适应技术，在5个自然图像和8个医学图像数据集上进行557个模拟实验，涵盖分布外、动态数据流和有限训练样本等多种场景。

Result: DSAN算法表现突出：在COVID-19数据集上达到91.2%的分类准确率；在动态数据流场景中相比基线提升6.7%；在COVID-19和皮肤癌数据集上展现出显著的可解释性。

Conclusion: 研究结果深化了对域适应技术的理解，为模型有效适应医学数据提供了宝贵见解，DSAN算法在医学图像分类中表现出色且具有良好可解释性。

Abstract: Domain adaptation (DA) techniques have the potential in machine learning to
alleviate distribution differences between training and test sets by leveraging
information from source domains. In image classification, most advances in DA
have been made using natural images rather than medical data, which are harder
to work with. Moreover, even for natural images, the use of mainstream datasets
can lead to performance bias. {With the aim of better understanding the
benefits of DA for both natural and medical images, this study performs 557
simulation studies using seven widely-used DA techniques for image
classification in five natural and eight medical datasets that cover various
scenarios, such as out-of-distribution, dynamic data streams, and limited
training samples.} Our experiments yield detailed results and insightful
observations highlighting the performance and medical applicability of these
techniques. Notably, our results have shown the outstanding performance of the
Deep Subdomain Adaptation Network (DSAN) algorithm. This algorithm achieved
feasible classification accuracy (91.2\%) in the COVID-19 dataset using
Resnet50 and showed an important accuracy improvement in the dynamic data
stream DA scenario (+6.7\%) compared to the baseline. Our results also
demonstrate that DSAN exhibits remarkable level of explainability when
evaluated on COVID-19 and skin cancer datasets. These results contribute to the
understanding of DA techniques and offer valuable insight into the effective
adaptation of models to medical data.

Motivation: 视频目标检测面临运动模糊、遮挡和变形等图像退化问题，现有方法通过特征聚合和复杂后处理提升性能但计算成本高，需要在不增加推理计算量的情况下提升鲁棒性

Method: 引入对比学习辅助分支(CLAB)，使用对比损失增强主干网络特征表示能力；提出动态损失权重策略，训练早期侧重辅助特征学习，后期逐渐侧重检测任务

Result: 在ImageNet VID数据集上，ResNet-101达到84.0% mAP，ResNeXt-101达到85.2% mAP，实现了CNN模型的state-of-the-art性能，无需额外后处理方法

Conclusion: CLAB方法有效提升了视频目标检测对图像退化的鲁棒性，在不增加推理计算成本的情况下取得了优异的性能表现

Abstract: Video object detection is a challenging task because videos often suffer from
image deterioration such as motion blur, occlusion, and deformable shapes,
making it significantly more difficult than detecting objects in still images.
Prior approaches have improved video object detection performance by employing
feature aggregation and complex post-processing techniques, though at the cost
of increased computational demands. To improve robustness to image degradation
without additional computational load during inference, we introduce a
straightforward yet effective Contrastive Learning through Auxiliary Branch
(CLAB) method. First, we implement a constrastive auxiliary branch using a
contrastive loss to enhance the feature representation capability of the video
object detector's backbone. Next, we propose a dynamic loss weighting strategy
that emphasizes auxiliary feature learning early in training while gradually
prioritizing the detection task as training converges. We validate our approach
through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating
consistent performance gains. Without bells and whistles, CLAB reaches a
performance of 84.0% mAP and 85.2% mAP with ResNet-101 and ResNeXt-101,
respectively, on the ImageNet VID dataset, thus achieving state-of-the-art
performance for CNN-based models without requiring additional post-processing
methods.

TL;DR: 本文分析了CLIP视觉编码器在排版攻击下的行为，发现特定注意力头负责提取排版信息，并提出了一种无需微调的防御方法，通过选择性消融注意力头电路来提升模型对排版攻击的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 排版攻击通过向图像中注入文本来操纵多模态系统，导致目标错误分类、恶意内容生成和视觉语言模型越狱。需要研究CLIP模型在这种攻击下的行为并开发有效的防御方法。

Method: 定位CLIP模型后半层中专用于提取和传输排版信息的注意力头，构建排版电路，然后通过选择性消融这些注意力头来防御排版攻击，无需微调。

Result: 在ImageNet-100的排版变体上性能提升高达19.6%，标准ImageNet-100准确率下降不到1%。无需训练的方法与依赖微调的最先进防御方法竞争力相当。

Conclusion: 发布了一系列抗排版攻击的dyslexic CLIP模型，这些模型可作为安全关键应用的即插即用替代方案，在文本识别效用与文本操纵风险之间取得更好平衡。

Abstract: Typographic attacks exploit multi-modal systems by injecting text into
images, leading to targeted misclassifications, malicious content generation
and even Vision-Language Model jailbreaks. In this work, we analyze how CLIP
vision encoders behave under typographic attacks, locating specialized
attention heads in the latter half of the model's layers that causally extract
and transmit typographic information to the cls token. Building on these
insights, we introduce a method to defend CLIP models against typographic
attacks by selectively ablating a typographic circuit, consisting of attention
heads. Without requiring finetuning, our method improves performance by up to
19.6% on a typographic variant of ImageNet-100, while reducing standard
ImageNet-100 accuracy by less than 1%. Notably, our training-free approach
remains competitive with current state-of-the-art typographic defenses that
rely on finetuning. To this end, we release a family of dyslexic CLIP models
which are significantly more robust against typographic attacks. These models
serve as suitable drop-in replacements for a broad range of safety-critical
applications, where the risks of text-based manipulation outweigh the utility
of text recognition.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) is a crucial task in computer vision with
wide range of applications including human computer interaction, surveillance,
and assistive technologies. However, challenges such as occlusion, expression
variability, and lack of interpretability hinder the performance of traditional
FER systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful alternative by
modeling relational dependencies between facial landmarks, enabling structured
and interpretable learning. In this paper, we propose GLaRE, a novel
Graph-based Landmark Region Embedding network for emotion recognition. Facial
landmarks are extracted using 3D facial alignment, and a quotient graph is
constructed via hierarchical coarsening to preserve spatial structure while
reducing complexity. Our method achieves 64.89 percentage accuracy on AffectNet
and 94.24 percentage on FERG, outperforming several existing baselines.
Additionally, ablation studies have demonstrated that region-level embeddings
from quotient graphs have contributed to improved prediction performance.

Conclusion: FastFit通过创新的缓存扩散架构成功解决了多参考虚拟试穿的效率和性能问题，为复杂多参考虚拟试穿研究提供了有效的解决方案和高质量数据集支持。

Abstract: Despite its great potential, virtual try-on technology is hindered from
real-world application by two major challenges: the inability of current
methods to support multi-reference outfit compositions (including garments and
accessories), and their significant inefficiency caused by the redundant
re-computation of reference features in each denoising step. To address these
challenges, we propose FastFit, a high-speed multi-reference virtual try-on
framework based on a novel cacheable diffusion architecture. By employing a
Semi-Attention mechanism and substituting traditional timestep embeddings with
class embeddings for reference items, our model fully decouples reference
feature encoding from the denoising process with negligible parameter overhead.
This allows reference features to be computed only once and losslessly reused
across all steps, fundamentally breaking the efficiency bottleneck and
achieving an average 3.5x speedup over comparable methods. Furthermore, to
facilitate research on complex, multi-reference virtual try-on, we introduce
DressCode-MR, a new large-scale dataset. It comprises 28,179 sets of
high-quality, paired images covering five key categories (tops, bottoms,
dresses, shoes, and bags), constructed through a pipeline of expert models and
human feedback refinement. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD, DressCode,
and our DressCode-MR datasets show that FastFit surpasses state-of-the-art
methods on key fidelity metrics while offering its significant advantage in
inference efficiency.

Abstract: The thermal camera excels at perceiving outdoor environments under low-light
conditions, making it ideal for applications such as nighttime autonomous
driving and unmanned navigation. However, thermal cameras encounter challenges
when capturing signage from objects made of similar materials, which can pose
safety risks for accurately understanding semantics in autonomous driving
systems. In contrast, the neuromorphic vision camera, also known as an event
camera, detects changes in light intensity asynchronously and has proven
effective in high-speed, low-light traffic environments. Recognizing the
complementary characteristics of these two modalities, this paper proposes
UTA-Sign, an unsupervised thermal-event video augmentation for traffic signage
in low-illumination environments, targeting elements such as license plates and
roadblock indicators. To address the signage blind spots of thermal imaging and
the non-uniform sampling of event cameras, we developed a dual-boosting
mechanism that fuses thermal frames and event signals for consistent signage
representation over time. The proposed method utilizes thermal frames to
provide accurate motion cues as temporal references for aligning the uneven
event signals. At the same time, event signals contribute subtle signage
content to the raw thermal frames, enhancing the overall understanding of the
environment. The proposed method is validated on datasets collected from
real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior quality in traffic signage
sketching and improved detection accuracy at the perceptual level.

Abstract: Deepfake technology, driven by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), poses
significant risks to privacy and societal security. Existing detection methods
are predominantly passive, focusing on post-event analysis without preventing
attacks. To address this, we propose an active defense method based on
low-frequency perceptual perturbations to disrupt face swapping manipulation,
reducing the performance and naturalness of generated content. Unlike prior
approaches that used low-frequency perturbations to impact classification
accuracy,our method directly targets the generative process of deepfake
techniques. We combine frequency and spatial domain features to strengthen
defenses. By introducing artifacts through low-frequency perturbations while
preserving high-frequency details, we ensure the output remains visually
plausible. Additionally, we design a complete architecture featuring an
encoder, a perturbation generator, and a decoder, leveraging discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to extract low-frequency components and generate perturbations
that disrupt facial manipulation models. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW
demonstrate significant reductions in face-swapping effectiveness, improved
defense success rates, and preservation of visual quality.

Abstract: Generating 3D human motions from text is a challenging yet valuable task. The
key aspects of this task are ensuring text-motion consistency and achieving
generation diversity. Although recent advancements have enabled the generation
of precise and high-quality human motions from text, achieving diversity in the
generated motions remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we aim to
overcome the above challenge by designing a simple yet effective text-to-motion
generation method, \textit{i.e.}, Diverse-T2M. Our method introduces
uncertainty into the generation process, enabling the generation of highly
diverse motions while preserving the semantic consistency of the text.
Specifically, we propose a novel perspective that utilizes noise signals as
carriers of diversity information in transformer-based methods, facilitating a
explicit modeling of uncertainty. Moreover, we construct a latent space where
text is projected into a continuous representation, instead of a rigid
one-to-one mapping, and integrate a latent space sampler to introduce
stochastic sampling into the generation process, thereby enhancing the
diversity and uncertainty of the outputs. Our results on text-to-motion
generation benchmark datasets~(HumanML3D and KIT-ML) demonstrate that our
method significantly enhances diversity while maintaining state-of-the-art
performance in text consistency.

Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound images are inherently challenging to interpret in
liver surgery due to the limited field of view and complex anatomical
structures. Bridging the gap between preoperative and intraoperative data is
crucial for effective surgical guidance. 3D IntraVascular UltraSound (IVUS)
offers a potential solution by enabling the reconstruction of the entire organ,
which facilitates registration between preoperative computed tomography (CT)
scans and intraoperative IVUS images. In this work, we propose an
optimization-based calibration method using a 3D-printed phantom for accurate
3D Intravascular Ultrasound volume reconstruction. Our approach ensures precise
alignment of tracked IVUS data with preoperative CT images, improving
intraoperative navigation. We validated our method using in vivo swine liver
images, achieving a calibration error from 0.88 to 1.80 mm and a registration
error from 3.40 to 5.71 mm between the 3D IVUS data and the corresponding CT
scan. Our method provides a reliable and accurate means of calibration and
volume reconstruction. It can be used to register intraoperative ultrasound
images with preoperative CT images in the context of liver surgery, and enhance
intraoperative guidance.

Conclusion: PI-GenMFI方法能有效生成高质量的合成MFI数据，为缺陷定位过程的优化提供了可行解决方案

Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, defect detection and localization are
critical to ensuring product quality and yield. While X-ray imaging is a
reliable non-destructive testing method, it is memory-intensive and
time-consuming for large-scale scanning, Magnetic Field Imaging (MFI) offers a
more efficient means to localize regions of interest (ROI) for targeted X-ray
scanning. However, the limited availability of MFI datasets due to proprietary
concerns presents a significant bottleneck for training machine learning (ML)
models using MFI. To address this challenge, we consider an ML-driven approach
leveraging diffusion models with two physical constraints. We propose Physics
Informed Generative Models for Magnetic Field Images (PI-GenMFI) to generate
synthetic MFI samples by integrating specific physical information. We generate
MFI images for the most common defect types: power shorts. These synthetic
images will serve as training data for ML algorithms designed to localize
defect areas efficiently. To evaluate generated MFIs, we compare our model to
SOTA generative models from both variational autoencoder (VAE) and diffusion
methods. We present a domain expert evaluation to assess the generated samples.
In addition, we present qualitative and quantitative evaluation using various
metrics used for image generation and signal processing, showing promising
results to optimize the defect localization process.

Motivation: 现有的模态对齐方法依赖外部数据集、人工标注或复杂的后处理，导致扩展性不好和成本高。需要一种不依赖外部资源的自主改善方案。

Method: 提出了偏见自我判断分数方法，让模型在内部生成自我评估指标，无需外部资源。该方法用于改善解码策略和偏好调整过程。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在减少幻觉现象、提升安全性和改善整体能力方面显著超过传统方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为大型视觉-语言模型的对齐提供了更有效的解决方案，通过自主自我评估实现了更好的多模态整合效果。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) have opened up new opportunities for integrating
visual and linguistic modalities. However, effectively aligning these
modalities remains challenging, often leading to hallucinations--where
generated outputs are not grounded in the visual input--and raising safety
concerns across various domains. Existing alignment methods, such as
instruction tuning and preference tuning, often rely on external datasets,
human annotations, or complex post-processing, which limit scalability and
increase costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
generates the debiased self-judgment score, a self-evaluation metric created
internally by the model without relying on external resources. This enables the
model to autonomously improve alignment. Our method enhances both decoding
strategies and preference tuning processes, resulting in reduced
hallucinations, enhanced safety, and improved overall capability. Empirical
results show that our approach significantly outperforms traditional methods,
offering a more effective solution for aligning LVLMs.

Motivation: 现有的数据重构攻击通常只在浅层模型上有效，且没有充分利用语义先验知识，导致重构质量和通用性受限

Method: 使用GAN框架结合进行性特征优化(PFO)，将生成器分解为层次块并逐步精炼中间表示，以提升重构图像的语义保真度，同时引入L1-ball约束来稳定优化

Result: 在广泛实验中，该方法在高分辨率场景、分布外设置以及面对更深更复杂的DNN模型时，表现远超之前的攻击方法

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种更加高效的数据重构攻击方法，显著提升了在分布式推理环境中的隐私风险，对于深度网络安全保护具有重要意义

Abstract: The growing complexity of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has led to the adoption
of Split Inference (SI), a collaborative paradigm that partitions computation
between edge devices and the cloud to reduce latency and protect user privacy.
However, recent advances in Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRAs) reveal that
intermediate features exchanged in SI can be exploited to recover sensitive
input data, posing significant privacy risks. Existing DRAs are typically
effective only on shallow models and fail to fully leverage semantic priors,
limiting their reconstruction quality and generalizability across datasets and
model architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based DRA framework
with Progressive Feature Optimization (PFO), which decomposes the generator
into hierarchical blocks and incrementally refines intermediate representations
to enhance the semantic fidelity of reconstructed images. To stabilize the
optimization and improve image realism, we introduce an L1-ball constraint
during reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
prior attacks by a large margin, especially in high-resolution scenarios,
out-of-distribution settings, and against deeper and more complex DNNs.

Abstract: Foundation image-text models such as CLIP with zero-shot capabilities enable
a wide array of applications. MobileCLIP is a recent family of image-text
models at 3-15ms latency and 50-150M parameters with state-of-the-art zero-shot
accuracy. The main ingredients in MobileCLIP were its low-latency and light
architectures and a novel multi-modal reinforced training that made knowledge
distillation from multiple caption-generators and CLIP teachers efficient,
scalable, and reproducible. In this paper, we improve the multi-modal
reinforced training of MobileCLIP through: 1) better CLIP teacher ensembles
trained on the DFN dataset, 2) improved captioner teachers trained on the DFN
dataset and fine-tuned on a diverse selection of high-quality image-caption
datasets. We discover new insights through ablations such as the importance of
temperature tuning in contrastive knowledge distillation, the effectiveness of
caption-generator fine-tuning for caption diversity, and the additive
improvement from combining synthetic captions generated by multiple models. We
train a new family of models called MobileCLIP2 and achieve state-of-the-art
ImageNet-1k zero-shot accuracies at low latencies. In particular, we observe
2.2% improvement in ImageNet-1k accuracy for MobileCLIP2-B compared with
MobileCLIP-B architecture. Notably, MobileCLIP2-S4 matches the zero-shot
accuracy of SigLIP-SO400M/14 on ImageNet-1k while being 2$\times$ smaller and
improves on DFN ViT-L/14 at 2.5$\times$ lower latency. We release our
pretrained models (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip) and the data
generation code (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip-dr). The data
generation code makes it easy to create new reinforced datasets with arbitrary
teachers using distributed scalable processing.

Abstract: Emotional talking head synthesis aims to generate talking portrait videos
with vivid expressions. Existing methods still exhibit limitations in control
flexibility, motion naturalness, and expression quality. Moreover, currently
available datasets are primarily collected in lab settings, further
exacerbating these shortcomings. Consequently, these limitations substantially
hinder practical applications in real-world scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose EmoCAST, a diffusion-based framework with two key
modules for precise text-driven emotional synthesis. In appearance modeling,
emotional prompts are integrated through a text-guided decoupled emotive
module, enhancing the spatial knowledge to improve emotion comprehension. To
improve the relationship between audio and emotion, we introduce an emotive
audio attention module to capture the interplay between controlled emotion and
driving audio, generating emotion-aware features to guide more precise facial
motion synthesis. Additionally, we construct an emotional talking head dataset
with comprehensive emotive text descriptions to optimize the framework's
performance. Based on the proposed dataset, we propose an emotion-aware
sampling training strategy and a progressive functional training strategy that
further improve the model's ability to capture nuanced expressive features and
achieve accurate lip-synchronization. Overall, EmoCAST achieves
state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic, emotionally expressive,
and audio-synchronized talking-head videos. Project Page:

Abstract: Existing Causal-Why Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models often struggle
with higher-order reasoning, relying on opaque, monolithic pipelines that
entangle video understanding, causal inference, and answer generation. These
black-box approaches offer limited interpretability and tend to depend on
shallow heuristics. We propose a novel, modular framework that explicitly
decouples causal reasoning from answer generation, introducing natural language
causal chains as interpretable intermediate representations. Inspired by human
cognitive models, these structured cause-effect sequences bridge low-level
video content with high-level causal reasoning, enabling transparent and
logically coherent inference. Our two-stage architecture comprises a Causal
Chain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs,
and a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that produces answers grounded in
these chains. To address the lack of annotated reasoning traces, we introduce a
scalable method for generating high-quality causal chains from existing
datasets using large language models. We also propose CauCo, a new evaluation
metric for causality-oriented captioning. Experiments on three large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art
models, but also yields substantial gains in explainability, user trust, and
generalization -- positioning the CCE as a reusable causal reasoning engine
across diverse domains. Project page:

Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality in
women, and early detection is essential for improving outcomes. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) is a highly sensitive tool for breast cancer detection,
particularly in women at high risk or with dense breast tissue, where
mammography is less effective. The ODELIA consortium organized a multi-center
challenge to foster AI-based solutions for breast cancer diagnosis and
classification. The dataset included 511 studies from six European centers,
acquired on scanners from multiple vendors at both 1.5 T and 3 T. Each study
was labeled for the left and right breast as no lesion, benign lesion, or
malignant lesion. We developed a SwinUNETR-based deep learning framework that
incorporates breast region masking, extensive data augmentation, and ensemble
learning to improve robustness and generalizability. Our method achieved second

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have significantly boosted the
reconstruction of head avatars, enabling high-quality facial modeling by
representing an 3D avatar as a collection of 3D Gaussians. However, existing
methods predominantly rely on frontal-view images, leaving the back-head poorly
constructed. This leads to geometric inconsistencies, structural blurring, and
reduced realism in the rear regions, ultimately limiting the fidelity of
reconstructed avatars. To address this challenge, we propose AvatarBack, a
novel plug-and-play framework specifically designed to reconstruct complete and
consistent 3D Gaussian avatars by explicitly modeling the missing back-head
regions. AvatarBack integrates two core technical innovations,i.e., the
Subject-specific Generator (SSG) and the Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy
(ASA). The former leverages a generative prior to synthesize
identity-consistent, plausible back-view pseudo-images from sparse frontal
inputs, providing robust multi-view supervision. To achieve precise geometric
alignment between these synthetic views and the 3D Gaussian representation, the
later employs learnable transformation matrices optimized during training,
effectively resolving inherent pose and coordinate discrepancies. Extensive
experiments on NeRSemble and K-hairstyle datasets, evaluated using geometric,
photometric, and GPT-4o-based perceptual metrics, demonstrate that AvatarBack
significantly enhances back-head reconstruction quality while preserving
frontal fidelity. Moreover, the reconstructed avatars maintain consistent
visual realism under diverse motions and remain fully animatable.

Abstract: Identifying sitters in historical paintings is a key task for art historians,
offering insight into their lives and how they chose to be seen. However, the
process is often subjective and limited by the lack of data and stylistic
variations. Automated facial recognition is capable of handling challenging
conditions and can assist, but while traditional facial recognition models
perform well on photographs, they struggle with paintings due to domain shift
and high intra-class variation. Artistic factors such as style, skill, intent,
and influence from other works further complicate recognition. In this work, we
investigate the potential of foundation models to improve facial recognition in
artworks. By fine-tuning foundation models and integrating their embeddings
with those from conventional facial recognition networks, we demonstrate
notable improvements over current state-of-the-art methods. Our results show
that foundation models can bridge the gap where traditional methods are
ineffective. Paper page at https://www.idiap.ch/paper/artface/

Conclusion: CraftGraffiti推进了身份尊重的AI辅助艺术创作目标，为创意AI应用中平衡风格自由和可识别性提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Preserving facial identity under extreme stylistic transformation remains a
major challenge in generative art. In graffiti, a high-contrast, abstract
medium, subtle distortions to the eyes, nose, or mouth can erase the subject's
recognizability, undermining both personal and cultural authenticity. We
present CraftGraffiti, an end-to-end text-guided graffiti generation framework
designed with facial feature preservation as a primary objective. Given an
input image and a style and pose descriptive prompt, CraftGraffiti first
applies graffiti style transfer via LoRA-fine-tuned pretrained diffusion
transformer, then enforces identity fidelity through a face-consistent
self-attention mechanism that augments attention layers with explicit identity
embeddings. Pose customization is achieved without keypoints, using CLIP-guided
prompt extension to enable dynamic re-posing while retaining facial coherence.
We formally justify and empirically validate the "style-first, identity-after"
paradigm, showing it reduces attribute drift compared to the reverse order.
Quantitative results demonstrate competitive facial feature consistency and
state-of-the-art aesthetic and human preference scores, while qualitative
analyses and a live deployment at the Cruilla Festival highlight the system's
real-world creative impact. CraftGraffiti advances the goal of
identity-respectful AI-assisted artistry, offering a principled approach for
blending stylistic freedom with recognizability in creative AI applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal AI have enabled progress in detecting synthetic

intent behind AI-generated images. To fill this gap, we introduce S-HArM, a
multimodal dataset for intent-aware classification, comprising 9,576 "in the

or Misinformation. Additionally, we explore three prompting strategies
(image-guided, description-guided, and multimodally-guided) to construct a
large-scale synthetic training dataset with Stable Diffusion. We conduct an
extensive comparative study including modality fusion, contrastive learning,
reconstruction networks, attention mechanisms, and large vision-language
models. Our results show that models trained on image- and multimodally-guided
data generalize better to "in the wild" content, due to preserved visual
context. However, overall performance remains limited, highlighting the
complexity of inferring intent and the need for specialized architectures.

Abstract: Neural Video Compression (NVC) has achieved remarkable performance in recent
years. However, precise rate control remains a challenge due to the inherent
limitations of learning-based codecs. To solve this issue, we propose a dynamic
video compression framework designed for variable bitrate scenarios. First, to
achieve variable bitrate implementation, we propose the Dynamic-Route
Autoencoder with variable coding routes, each occupying partial computational
complexity of the whole network and navigating to a distinct RD trade-off.
Second, to approach the target bitrate, the Rate Control Agent estimates the
bitrate of each route and adjusts the coding route of DRA at run time. To
encompass a broad spectrum of variable bitrates while preserving overall RD
performance, we employ the Joint-Routes Optimization strategy, achieving
collaborative training of various routes. Extensive experiments on the HEVC and
UVG datasets show that the proposed method achieves an average BD-Rate
reduction of 14.8% and BD-PSNR gain of 0.47dB over state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining an average bitrate error of 1.66%, achieving
Rate-Distortion-Complexity Optimization (RDCO) for various bitrate and
bitrate-constrained applications. Our code is available at

Abstract: Accurate cardiac motion estimation from cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
images is vital for assessing cardiac function and detecting its abnormalities.
Existing methods often struggle to capture heart motion accurately because they
rely on intensity-based image registration similarity losses that may overlook
cardiac anatomical regions. To address this, we propose CardioMorphNet, a
recurrent Bayesian deep learning framework for 3D cardiac shape-guided
deformable registration using short-axis (SAX) CMR images. It employs a
recurrent variational autoencoder to model spatio-temporal dependencies over
the cardiac cycle and two posterior models for bi-ventricular segmentation and
motion estimation. The derived loss function from the Bayesian formulation
guides the framework to focus on anatomical regions by recursively registering
segmentation maps without using intensity-based image registration similarity
loss, while leveraging sequential SAX volumes and spatio-temporal features. The
Bayesian modelling also enables computation of uncertainty maps for the
estimated motion fields. Validated on the UK Biobank dataset by comparing
warped mask shapes with ground truth masks, CardioMorphNet demonstrates
superior performance in cardiac motion estimation, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Uncertainty assessment shows that it also yields
lower uncertainty values for estimated motion fields in the cardiac region
compared with other probabilistic-based cardiac registration methods,
indicating higher confidence in its predictions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于非典型有丝分裂图像分类的域鲁棒训练方法，通过风格扰动、注意力特征对齐和EMA教师蒸馏，在MIDOG 2025挑战中取得了优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非典型有丝分裂图像(AMFs)是重要的组织病理学标志物，但在不同扫描仪、染色和采集条件导致的域偏移下难以保持一致的识别性能

Method: 三阶段方法：(i)在骨干网络早期和中期插入风格扰动增加特征多样性；(ii)利用粗粒度域标签通过辅助对齐损失对齐注意力精炼特征；(iii)使用EMA教师模型和温度缩放KL散度进行预测蒸馏

Result: 在MIDOG 2025初步排行榜上获得：平衡准确率0.8762、灵敏度0.8873、特异性0.8651、ROC AUC 0.9499

Conclusion: 该方法推理开销可忽略，仅需粗粒度域元数据，提供强大且平衡的性能，是MIDOG 2025挑战的有竞争力方案

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are important histopathological markers yet
remain challenging to identify consistently, particularly under domain shift
stemming from scanner, stain, and acquisition differences. We present a simple
training-time recipe for domain-robust AMF classification in MIDOG 2025 Task 2.
The approach (i) increases feature diversity via style perturbations inserted
at early and mid backbone stages, (ii) aligns attention-refined features across
sites using weak domain labels (Scanner, Origin, Species, Tumor) through an
auxiliary alignment loss, and (iii) stabilizes predictions by distilling from
an exponential moving average (EMA) teacher with temperature-scaled KL
divergence. On the organizer-run preliminary leaderboard for atypical mitosis
classification, our submission attains balanced accuracy of 0.8762, sensitivity
of 0.8873, specificity of 0.8651, and ROC AUC of 0.9499. The method incurs
negligible inference-time overhead, relies only on coarse domain metadata, and
delivers strong, balanced performance, positioning it as a competitive
submission for the MIDOG 2025 challenge.

TL;DR: 提出了Pref-GRPO方法解决T2I生成中的奖励破解问题，通过成对偏好比较替代点式评分；同时引入UniGenBench综合评估基准，包含600个提示和37个评估标准


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于点式奖励模型的T2I生成方法容易受到奖励破解影响，微小分数差异在归一化后被放大，导致模型过度优化琐碎增益而破坏生成稳定性

Method: Pref-GRPO：基于成对偏好奖励的GRPO方法，使用偏好奖励模型在组内进行图像成对比较，以胜率作为奖励信号；UniGenBench：包含5大主题20子主题的600个提示，通过10个主要标准和27个子标准评估语义一致性

Result: Pref-GRPO能够区分细微的图像质量差异，提供更稳定的优势并缓解奖励破解；UniGenBench揭示了开源和闭源T2I模型的优缺点，验证了Pref-GRPO的有效性

Conclusion: Pref-GRPO通过偏好拟合替代分数最大化实现了更稳定的训练，UniGenBench为T2I模型提供了更全面的评估框架

Abstract: Recent advancements highlight the importance of GRPO-based reinforcement
learning methods and benchmarking in enhancing text-to-image (T2I) generation.
However, current methods using pointwise reward models (RM) for scoring
generated images are susceptible to reward hacking. We reveal that this happens
when minimal score differences between images are amplified after
normalization, creating illusory advantages that drive the model to
over-optimize for trivial gains, ultimately destabilizing the image generation
process. To address this, we propose Pref-GRPO, a pairwise preference
reward-based GRPO method that shifts the optimization objective from score
maximization to preference fitting, ensuring more stable training. In
Pref-GRPO, images are pairwise compared within each group using preference RM,
and the win rate is used as the reward signal. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PREF-GRPO differentiates subtle image quality differences,
providing more stable advantages and mitigating reward hacking. Additionally,
existing T2I benchmarks are limited by coarse evaluation criteria, hindering
comprehensive model assessment. To solve this, we introduce UniGenBench, a
unified T2I benchmark comprising 600 prompts across 5 main themes and 20
subthemes. It evaluates semantic consistency through 10 primary and 27
sub-criteria, leveraging MLLM for benchmark construction and evaluation. Our
benchmarks uncover the strengths and weaknesses of both open and closed-source
T2I models and validate the effectiveness of Pref-GRPO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在编码判别性、多视角一致特征方面存在不足，难以从稀疏输入视图构建准确几何结构，限制了渲染质量和泛化能力。

Method: 提出C3-GS框架，集成三个轻量级模块到统一渲染流水线中：上下文感知模块、跨维度约束模块和跨尺度约束模块，改善特征融合并实现逼真合成。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验验证，C3-GS实现了最先进的渲染质量和泛化能力，代码已开源。

Conclusion: 该框架通过多约束特征学习有效解决了稀疏视图下的几何构建问题，为通用高斯泼溅提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Generalizable Gaussian Splatting aims to synthesize novel views for unseen
scenes without per-scene optimization. In particular, recent advancements
utilize feed-forward networks to predict per-pixel Gaussian parameters,
enabling high-quality synthesis from sparse input views. However, existing
approaches fall short in encoding discriminative, multi-view consistent
features for Gaussian predictions, which struggle to construct accurate
geometry with sparse views. To address this, we propose $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS, a
framework that enhances feature learning by incorporating context-aware,
cross-dimension, and cross-scale constraints. Our architecture integrates three
lightweight modules into a unified rendering pipeline, improving feature fusion
and enabling photorealistic synthesis without requiring additional supervision.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate that $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS
achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and generalization ability. Code is

*Jiawen Lin,Shiran Bian,Yihang Zhu,Wenbin Tan,Yachao Zhang,Yuan Xie,Yanyun Qu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeqVLM是一个新颖的零样本3D视觉定位框架，通过多视角真实场景图像和空间信息进行目标对象推理，在ScanRefer和Nr3D基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的零样本3D视觉定位方法面临空间受限推理的挑战，主要依赖单视角定位，存在上下文遗漏和细节退化问题。需要消除场景特定训练要求，提高真实世界应用的泛化能力。

Method: 首先通过3D语义分割网络生成3D实例提案，并通过语义过滤进行精炼。采用提案引导的多视角投影策略将候选提案投影到真实场景图像序列上，保持空间关系和上下文细节。实施动态调度机制迭代处理序列查询提示，利用VLM的跨模态推理能力识别文本指定的对象。

Result: 在ScanRefer和Nr3D基准测试中分别达到55.6%和53.2%的Acc@0.25分数，比之前的零样本方法分别提升了4.0%和5.2%。

Conclusion: SeqVLM框架通过多视角推理和空间信息利用，显著提高了零样本3D视觉定位的性能，推动了3DVG向更好泛化能力和真实世界适用性的发展。

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize objects in 3D scenes using
natural language descriptions. Although supervised methods achieve higher
accuracy in constrained settings, zero-shot 3DVG holds greater promise for
real-world applications since eliminating scene-specific training requirements.
However, existing zero-shot methods face challenges of spatial-limited
reasoning due to reliance on single-view localization, and contextual omissions
or detail degradation. To address these issues, we propose SeqVLM, a novel
zero-shot 3DVG framework that leverages multi-view real-world scene images with
spatial information for target object reasoning. Specifically, SeqVLM first
generates 3D instance proposals via a 3D semantic segmentation network and
refines them through semantic filtering, retaining only semantic-relevant
candidates. A proposal-guided multi-view projection strategy then projects
these candidate proposals onto real scene image sequences, preserving spatial
relationships and contextual details in the conversion process of 3D point
cloud to images. Furthermore, to mitigate VLM computational overload, we
implement a dynamic scheduling mechanism that iteratively processes
sequances-query prompts, leveraging VLM's cross-modal reasoning capabilities to
identify textually specified objects. Experiments on the ScanRefer and Nr3D
benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving Acc@0.25 scores
of 55.6% and 53.2%, surpassing previous zero-shot methods by 4.0% and 5.2%,
respectively, which advance 3DVG toward greater generalization and real-world
applicability. The code is available at https://github.com/JiawLin/SeqVLM.

TL;DR: 研究了CLIP视觉语言模型在军事环境中对遮挡的鲁棒性，发现Transformer架构优于CNN，分散遮挡比集中遮挡影响更大，微调后模型能在60%遮挡下保持性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索CLIP在军事应用中的鲁棒性，特别是在遮挡和低信噪比环境下的表现，因为现有研究对此关注不足

Method: 使用18类军事车辆自定义数据集，评估不同CLIP变体在不同遮挡比例下的性能，采用NAUC指标，比较Transformer和CNN架构，分析线性探测和骨干网络微调的效果

Result: 1) Transformer-based CLIP优于CNN；2) 分散细粒度遮挡比集中大遮挡影响更大；3) 线性探测模型在35%遮挡时性能骤降；4) 骨干网络微调后模型能在60%遮挡下保持性能

Conclusion: 需要在训练中加入遮挡特定的数据增强，并进一步研究补丁级敏感性和架构韧性，以提高CLIP在真实军事部署中的鲁棒性

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared embedding space, offering advantages for
defense applications with scarce labeled data. However, CLIP's robustness in
challenging military environments, with partial occlusion and degraded
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), remains underexplored. We investigate CLIP
variants' robustness to occlusion using a custom dataset of 18 military vehicle
classes and evaluate using Normalized Area Under the Curve (NAUC) across
occlusion percentages. Four key insights emerge: (1) Transformer-based CLIP
models consistently outperform CNNs, (2) fine-grained, dispersed occlusions
degrade performance more than larger contiguous occlusions, (3) despite
improved accuracy, performance of linear-probed models sharply drops at around
35% occlusion, (4) by finetuning the model's backbone, this performance drop
occurs at more than 60% occlusion. These results underscore the importance of
occlusion-specific augmentations during training and the need for further
exploration into patch-level sensitivity and architectural resilience for
real-world deployment of CLIP.

Conclusion: 该架构通过全局和多层次特征表示，有效提升了自动驾驶模型的性能，消融研究将进一步验证各组件贡献

Abstract: Focusing on the development of an end-to-end autonomous vehicle model with
pixel-to-pixel context awareness, this research proposes the SKGE-Swin
architecture. This architecture utilizes the Swin Transformer with a skip-stage
mechanism to broaden feature representation globally and at various network
levels. This approach enables the model to extract information from distant
pixels by leveraging the Swin Transformer's Shifted Window-based Multi-head
Self-Attention (SW-MSA) mechanism and to retain critical information from the
initial to the final stages of feature extraction, thereby enhancing its
capability to comprehend complex patterns in the vehicle's surroundings. The
model is evaluated on the CARLA platform using adversarial scenarios to
simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the
SKGE-Swin architecture achieves a superior Driving Score compared to previous
methods. Furthermore, an ablation study will be conducted to evaluate the
contribution of each architectural component, including the influence of skip
connections and the use of the Swin Transformer, in improving model
performance.

Conclusion: 利用基础模型和多模态方法，结合数十年的社区经验，将有助于解决视频抽象概念理解这一重大开放挑战，使模型更符合人类推理和价值观。

Abstract: The automatic understanding of video content is advancing rapidly. Empowered
by deeper neural networks and large datasets, machines are increasingly capable
of understanding what is concretely visible in video frames, whether it be
objects, actions, events, or scenes. In comparison, humans retain a unique
ability to also look beyond concrete entities and recognize abstract concepts
like justice, freedom, and togetherness. Abstract concept recognition forms a
crucial open challenge in video understanding, where reasoning on multiple
semantic levels based on contextual information is key. In this paper, we argue
that the recent advances in foundation models make for an ideal setting to
address abstract concept understanding in videos. Automated understanding of
high-level abstract concepts is imperative as it enables models to be more
aligned with human reasoning and values. In this survey, we study different
tasks and datasets used to understand abstract concepts in video content. We
observe that, periodically and over a long period, researchers have attempted
to solve these tasks, making the best use of the tools available at their
disposal. We advocate that drawing on decades of community experience will help
us shed light on this important open grand challenge and avoid ``re-inventing
the wheel'' as we start revisiting it in the era of multi-modal foundation
models.

Conclusion: 该研究提出的全局类激活概率地图评估方法有效解决了现有可解释性方法的局限性，通过更全面的激活地图分析和错误检测机制，为医生和病人提供更可靠的AI辅助诊断。

Abstract: Recent advancements in skin lesion classification models have significantly
improved accuracy, with some models even surpassing dermatologists' diagnostic
performance. However, in medical practice, distrust in AI models remains a
challenge. Beyond high accuracy, trustworthy, explainable diagnoses are
essential. Existing explainability methods have reliability issues, with
LIME-based methods suffering from inconsistency, while CAM-based methods
failing to consider all classes. To address these limitations, we propose
Global Class Activation Probabilistic Map Evaluation, a method that analyses
all classes' activation probability maps probabilistically and at a pixel
level. By visualizing the diagnostic process in a unified manner, it helps
reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. Furthermore, the application of SafeML
enhances the detection of false diagnoses and issues warnings to doctors and
patients as needed, improving diagnostic reliability and ultimately patient
safety. We evaluated our method using the ISIC datasets with MobileNetV2 and
Vision Transformers.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了扩散分类器在组合泛化能力方面是否优于判别式模型（如CLIP和ViLT），特别是在属性绑定和关系推理任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言语义的一个基本方面是能够从已知部分组合出新含义。虽然视觉语言模型（VLMs）取得了显著进展，但有证据表明它们在组合语义方面存在困难，例如无法正确绑定属性和对象。

Method: 评估了三种模型（扩散分类器、CLIP和ViLT）在零样本学习（ZSL）和广义零样本学习（GZSL）设置下绑定对象属性和关系的能力。分析了CLIP嵌入表示来探究困难根源。

Result: 扩散分类器和ViLT在概念绑定任务上表现良好，但所有模型在关系GZSL任务上都面临显著困难。CLIP嵌入分析表明，关系概念（如左右）的表示过于相似可能是困难的原因。

Conclusion: 虽然扩散分类器在某些组合任务上表现更好，但所有视觉语言模型在关系推理方面都面临根本性挑战，需要进一步改进表示学习方法来处理组合语义。

Abstract: A fundamental aspect of the semantics of natural language is that novel
meanings can be formed from the composition of previously known parts.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in recent years,
however, there is evidence that they are unable to perform this kind of
composition. For example, given an image of a red cube and a blue cylinder, a
VLM such as CLIP is likely to incorrectly label the image as a red cylinder or
a blue cube, indicating it represents the image as a `bag-of-words' and fails
to capture compositional semantics. Diffusion models have recently gained
significant attention for their impressive generative abilities, and zero-shot
classifiers based on diffusion models have been shown to perform competitively
with CLIP in certain compositional tasks. In this work we explore whether the
generative Diffusion Classifier has improved compositional generalisation
abilities compared to discriminative models. We assess three models --
Diffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT -- on their ability to bind objects with
attributes and relations in both zero-shot learning (ZSL) and generalised
zero-shot learning (GZSL) settings. Our results show that the Diffusion
Classifier and ViLT perform well at concept binding tasks, but that all models
struggle significantly with the relational GZSL task, underscoring the broader
challenges VLMs face with relational reasoning. Analysis of CLIP embeddings
suggests that the difficulty may stem from overly similar representations of
relational concepts such as left and right. Code and dataset are available at:

Conclusion: 该方法通过考虑点的方向和不确定性，有效提升了点云注册的准确性和稳健性，适用于远程感知和数字遗产保护等应用场景。

Abstract: Point cloud registration is crucial for ensuring 3D alignment consistency of
multiple local point clouds in 3D reconstruction for remote sensing or digital
heritage. While various point cloud-based registration methods exist, both
non-learning and learning-based, they ignore point orientations and point
uncertainties, making the model susceptible to noisy input and aggressive
rotations of the input point cloud like orthogonal transformation; thus, it
necessitates extensive training point clouds with transformation augmentations.
To address these issues, we propose a novel surfel-based pose learning
regression approach. Our method can initialize surfels from Lidar point cloud
using virtual perspective camera parameters, and learns explicit
$\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant features, including both position and rotation
through $\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant convolutional kernels to predict relative
transformation between source and target scans. The model comprises an
equivariant convolutional encoder, a cross-attention mechanism for similarity
computation, a fully-connected decoder, and a non-linear Huber loss.
Experimental results on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate our model
superiority and robust performance on real point-cloud scans compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DVCTNet通过双视图协同训练和特征融合，有效提升了龋齿检测性能，具有重要的临床应用价值

Abstract: Accurate dental caries detection from panoramic X-rays plays a pivotal role
in preventing lesion progression. However, current detection methods often
yield suboptimal accuracy due to subtle contrast variations and diverse lesion
morphology of dental caries. In this work, inspired by the clinical workflow
where dentists systematically combine whole-image screening with detailed
tooth-level inspection, we present DVCTNet, a novel Dual-View Co-Training
network for accurate dental caries detection. Our DVCTNet starts with employing
automated tooth detection to establish two complementary views: a global view
from panoramic X-ray images and a local view from cropped tooth images. We then
pretrain two vision foundation models separately on the two views. The
global-view foundation model serves as the detection backbone, generating
region proposals and global features, while the local-view model extracts
detailed features from corresponding cropped tooth patches matched by the
region proposals. To effectively integrate information from both views, we
introduce a Gated Cross-View Attention (GCV-Atten) module that dynamically
fuses dual-view features, enhancing the detection pipeline by integrating the
fused features back into the detection model for final caries detection. To
rigorously evaluate our DVCTNet, we test it on a public dataset and further
validate its performance on a newly curated, high-precision dental caries
detection dataset, annotated using both intra-oral images and panoramic X-rays
for double verification. Experimental results demonstrate DVCTNet's superior
performance against existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both datasets,
indicating the clinical applicability of our method. Our code and labeled
dataset are available at https://github.com/ShanghaiTech-IMPACT/DVCTNet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VIF方法主要关注图像质量优化，近期研究开始引入语义分割和目标检测等下游任务提供语义指导，但这些方法存在标注成本高、在密集场景中效果受限的问题。RGB-T人群计数虽然受到关注但尚未与VIF整合

Method: 提出多任务学习框架FusionCounting，将人群计数集成到VIF过程中；采用动态损失函数权重策略平衡任务贡献；引入对抗训练增强模型鲁棒性

Result: 在公共数据集上的实验表明，FusionCounting不仅提升了图像融合质量，还实现了优越的人群计数性能

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了密集场景中VIF与人群计数的整合问题，通过最小化标注需求实现了两个任务的协同提升，为多模态视觉任务提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Most visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) methods focus primarily on
optimizing fused image quality. Recent studies have begun incorporating
downstream tasks, such as semantic segmentation and object detection, to
provide semantic guidance for VIF. However, semantic segmentation requires
extensive annotations, while object detection, despite reducing annotation
efforts compared with segmentation, faces challenges in highly crowded scenes
due to overlapping bounding boxes and occlusion. Moreover, although RGB-T crowd
counting has gained increasing attention in recent years, no studies have
integrated VIF and crowd counting into a unified framework. To address these
challenges, we propose FusionCounting, a novel multi-task learning framework
that integrates crowd counting into the VIF process. Crowd counting provides a
direct quantitative measure of population density with minimal annotation,
making it particularly suitable for dense scenes. Our framework leverages both
input images and population density information in a mutually beneficial
multi-task design. To accelerate convergence and balance tasks contributions,
we introduce a dynamic loss function weighting strategy. Furthermore, we
incorporate adversarial training to enhance the robustness of both VIF and
crowd counting, improving the model's stability and resilience to adversarial
attacks. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that
FusionCounting not only enhances image fusion quality but also achieves
superior crowd counting performance.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel pipeline for 2D keypoint estima- tion of surgical
tools by leveraging Vision Language Models (VLMs) fine- tuned using a low rank
adjusting (LoRA) technique. Unlike traditional Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) or Transformer-based approaches, which often suffer from overfitting in
small-scale medical datasets, our method harnesses the generalization
capabilities of pre-trained VLMs. We carefully design prompts to create an
instruction-tuning dataset and use them to align visual features with semantic
keypoint descriptions. Experimental results show that with only two epochs of
fine tuning, the adapted VLM outperforms the baseline models, demonstrating the
ef- fectiveness of LoRA in low-resource scenarios. This approach not only
improves keypoint detection performance, but also paves the way for future work
in 3D surgical hands and tools pose estimation.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了PointDGRWKV框架，首次将RWKV架构应用于点云分类领域的域逆向通用性问题，解决了传统方法的接收域局限和计算成本高等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的域逆向通用性点云分类方法存在接收域局限、计算成本高或长程依赖建模不足等问题，而RWKV架构具有线性复杂度、全局接收域和长程依赖优势，但直接应用于点云数据会导致空间扭曲和波动问题。

Method: 提出PointDGRWKV框架，包含两个核心模块：适应性几何token移位（Adaptive Geometric Token Shift）来建模局部空间结构，以及跨域关键特征分布对齐（Cross-Domain key feature Distribution Alignment）来减少波动影响。

Result: 在多个标准数据集上的实验表明，PointDGRWKV在域逆向通用性点云分类任务上达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: 这项工作成功将RWKV架构应用于点云数据的域逆向通用性问题，通过两个创新模块解决了直接应用时的空间扭曲和波动问题，同时保持了线性计算效率。

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) has been recently explored to enhance the
generalizability of Point Cloud Classification (PCC) models toward unseen
domains. Prior works are based on convolutional networks, Transformer or Mamba
architectures, either suffering from limited receptive fields or high
computational cost, or insufficient long-range dependency modeling. RWKV, as an
emerging architecture, possesses superior linear complexity, global receptive
fields, and long-range dependency. In this paper, we present the first work
that studies the generalizability of RWKV models in DG PCC. We find that
directly applying RWKV to DG PCC encounters two significant challenges: RWKV's
fixed direction token shift methods, like Q-Shift, introduce spatial
distortions when applied to unstructured point clouds, weakening local
geometric modeling and reducing robustness. In addition, the Bi-WKV attention
in RWKV amplifies slight cross-domain differences in key distributions through
exponential weighting, leading to attention shifts and degraded generalization.
To this end, we propose PointDGRWKV, the first RWKV-based framework tailored
for DG PCC. It introduces two key modules to enhance spatial modeling and
cross-domain robustness, while maintaining RWKV's linear efficiency. In
particular, we present Adaptive Geometric Token Shift to model local
neighborhood structures to improve geometric context awareness. In addition,
Cross-Domain key feature Distribution Alignment is designed to mitigate
attention drift by aligning key feature distributions across domains. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PointDGRWKV achieves
state-of-the-art performance on DG PCC.

TL;DR: PathMR是一个细胞级多模态视觉推理框架，用于病理图像分析，能够生成专家级诊断解释并预测细胞分布模式，在文本生成质量、分割准确性和跨模态对齐方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习病理诊断虽然提高了效率，但模型决策不透明且缺乏可追溯依据，限制了临床采用。需要提供透明可解释的AI辅助病理诊断。

Method: 提出PathMR框架，基于多模态视觉推理架构，在给定病理图像和文本查询时，生成像素级分割掩码和语义对齐的文本解释，同时预测细胞分布模式。

Result: 在PathGen数据集和新开发的GADVR数据集上，PathMR在文本生成质量、分割准确性和跨模态对齐方面均优于最先进的视觉推理方法。

Conclusion: PathMR展示了在AI驱动病理诊断中提高可解释性的潜力，代码将公开提供。

Abstract: Deep learning based automated pathological diagnosis has markedly improved
diagnostic efficiency and reduced variability between observers, yet its
clinical adoption remains limited by opaque model decisions and a lack of
traceable rationale. To address this, recent multimodal visual reasoning
architectures provide a unified framework that generates segmentation masks at
the pixel level alongside semantically aligned textual explanations. By
localizing lesion regions and producing expert style diagnostic narratives,
these models deliver the transparent and interpretable insights necessary for
dependable AI assisted pathology. Building on these advancements, we propose
PathMR, a cell-level Multimodal visual Reasoning framework for Pathological
image analysis. Given a pathological image and a textual query, PathMR
generates expert-level diagnostic explanations while simultaneously predicting
cell distribution patterns. To benchmark its performance, we evaluated our
approach on the publicly available PathGen dataset as well as on our newly
developed GADVR dataset. Extensive experiments on these two datasets
demonstrate that PathMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art visual
reasoning methods in text generation quality, segmentation accuracy, and
cross-modal alignment. These results highlight the potential of PathMR for
improving interpretability in AI-driven pathological diagnosis. The code will
be publicly available in https://github.com/zhangye-zoe/PathMR.

TL;DR: 深度学习框架通过自发光和二次调制生成双模态成像进行早期腰腹管腺瘤的高精度检测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 腰腹管腺瘤(PDAC)是杀伤力最强的癌症之一，五年生存率低于10%，主要原因是检测晚期，需要开发早期识别技术

Method: 分析40例患者样本，使用自发光和SHG双模态成像，比较6种深度学习架构，包括CNN和ViT，采用修改的ResNet网络与冻结预训练层和类别权重训练

Result: 检测准确率超10%，达到了90%以上的准确率，显著改善了传统手工分析方法

Conclusion: 建立了自动化PDAC检测的稳健流程，可以增强病理学家能力，为其他癌症类型的扩展奠定基础，并为小样本医学图像数据集的深度学习应用提供价值

Abstract: Pacreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal forms
of cancer, with a five-year survival rate below 10% primarily due to late
detection. This research develops and validates a deep learning framework for
early PDAC detection through analysis of dual-modality imaging:
autofluorescence and second harmonic generation (SHG). We analyzed 40 unique
patient samples to create a specialized neural network capable of
distinguishing between normal, fibrotic, and cancerous tissue. Our methodology
evaluated six distinct deep learning architectures, comparing traditional
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with modern Vision Transformers (ViTs).
Through systematic experimentation, we identified and overcome significant
challenges in medical image analysis, including limited dataset size and class
imbalance. The final optimized framework, based on a modified ResNet
architecture with frozen pre-trained layers and class-weighted training,
achieved over 90% accuracy in cancer detection. This represents a significant
improvement over current manual analysis methods an demonstrates potential for
clinical deployment. This work establishes a robust pipeline for automated PDAC
detection that can augment pathologists' capabilities while providing a
foundation for future expansion to other cancer types. The developed
methodology also offers valuable insights for applying deep learning to
limited-size medical imaging datasets, a common challenge in clinical
applications.

*Pushkar Shukla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了基于反事实推理的框架，用于解释、审计和缓解视觉分类器和生成模型中的偏见，包括CAVLI、ASAC、TIBET、BiasConnect和InterMit等方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反事实推理已成为可解释和公平AI的核心方法，需要系统性的框架来发现虚假相关性、探索因果依赖关系，并构建更鲁棒的系统

Method: 开发了多个反事实框架：CAVLI结合归因和概念分析；ASAC使用对抗性反事实；TIBET提供可扩展的偏见评估流程；BiasConnect构建因果图；InterMit采用训练免费算法

Result: 这些方法能够量化模型对可解释概念的依赖程度，改善模型的公平性和准确性，诊断交叉偏见，并通过因果敏感性评分缓解偏见

Conclusion: 反事实推理为判别性和生成性模型中的可解释性、公平性和因果性提供了统一视角，建立了原则性、可扩展的社会责任偏见评估和缓解方法

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning -- the practice of asking ``what if'' by varying
inputs and observing changes in model behavior -- has become central to
interpretable and fair AI. This thesis develops frameworks that use
counterfactuals to explain, audit, and mitigate bias in vision classifiers and
generative models. By systematically altering semantically meaningful
attributes while holding others fixed, these methods uncover spurious
correlations, probe causal dependencies, and help build more robust systems.
  The first part addresses vision classifiers. CAVLI integrates attribution
(LIME) with concept-level analysis (TCAV) to quantify how strongly decisions
rely on human-interpretable concepts. With localized heatmaps and a Concept
Dependency Score, CAVLI shows when models depend on irrelevant cues like
backgrounds. Extending this, ASAC introduces adversarial counterfactuals that
perturb protected attributes while preserving semantics. Through curriculum
learning, ASAC fine-tunes biased models for improved fairness and accuracy
while avoiding stereotype-laden artifacts.
  The second part targets generative Text-to-Image (TTI) models. TIBET provides
a scalable pipeline for evaluating prompt-sensitive biases by varying
identity-related terms, enabling causal auditing of how race, gender, and age
affect image generation. To capture interactions, BiasConnect builds causal
graphs diagnosing intersectional biases. Finally, InterMit offers a modular,
training-free algorithm that mitigates intersectional bias via causal
sensitivity scores and user-defined fairness goals.
  Together, these contributions show counterfactuals as a unifying lens for
interpretability, fairness, and causality in both discriminative and generative
models, establishing principled, scalable methods for socially responsible bias
evaluation and mitigation.

Conclusion: 该工作为理解和推进统一感知奠定了基础，整合了碎片化研究，指导未来研究朝着更鲁棒、可泛化和可解释的感知方向发展。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle perception typically relies on modular pipelines that
decompose the task into detection, tracking, and prediction. While
interpretable, these pipelines suffer from error accumulation and limited
inter-task synergy. Unified perception has emerged as a promising paradigm that
integrates these sub-tasks within a shared architecture, potentially improving
robustness, contextual reasoning, and efficiency while retaining interpretable
outputs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of unified
perception, introducing a holistic and systemic taxonomy that categorizes
methods along task integration, tracking formulation, and representation flow.
We define three paradigms -Early, Late, and Full Unified Perception- and
systematically review existing methods, their architectures, training
strategies, datasets used, and open-source availability, while highlighting
future research directions. This work establishes the first comprehensive
framework for understanding and advancing unified perception, consolidates
fragmented efforts, and guides future research toward more robust,
generalizable, and interpretable perception.

Motivation: 虽然在大规模自然图像数据集上预训练的基础模型为医学图像分割提供了强大范式，但如何有效迁移其学习表示以用于精确临床应用仍是一个挑战。

Method: 提出Dino U-Net架构：使用冻结的DINOv3骨干网络作为编码器，通过专用适配器融合丰富的语义特征和低层次空间细节，设计保真度感知投影模块(FAPM)在降维过程中保持表示质量。

Result: 在七个不同的公共医学图像分割数据集上进行广泛实验，Dino U-Net实现了最先进的性能，在各种成像模态上始终优于先前方法，且随着骨干模型规模增大（最高70亿参数），分割准确性持续提升。

Conclusion: 利用通用基础模型的优质密集预训练特征，为提升医学图像分割准确性提供了高效且参数效率高的方法，证明了该框架的高度可扩展性。

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on large-scale natural image datasets offer a
powerful paradigm for medical image segmentation. However, effectively
transferring their learned representations for precise clinical applications
remains a challenge. In this work, we propose Dino U-Net, a novel
encoder-decoder architecture designed to exploit the high-fidelity dense
features of the DINOv3 vision foundation model. Our architecture introduces an
encoder built upon a frozen DINOv3 backbone, which employs a specialized
adapter to fuse the model's rich semantic features with low-level spatial
details. To preserve the quality of these representations during dimensionality
reduction, we design a new fidelity-aware projection module (FAPM) that
effectively refines and projects the features for the decoder. We conducted
extensive experiments on seven diverse public medical image segmentation
datasets. Our results show that Dino U-Net achieves state-of-the-art
performance, consistently outperforming previous methods across various imaging
modalities. Our framework proves to be highly scalable, with segmentation
accuracy consistently improving as the backbone model size increases up to the
7-billion-parameter variant. The findings demonstrate that leveraging the
superior, dense-pretrained features from a general-purpose foundation model
provides a highly effective and parameter-efficient approach to advance the
accuracy of medical image segmentation. The code is available at

Method: 基于AUCMEDI框架训练ConvNeXtBase模型集成，并添加基于规则的细化模块

Result: 集成模型在MIDOG25初步测试集上获得84.02%平衡准确率，规则细化模块提高了特异性但降低了敏感性和整体性能

Conclusion: 深度集成模型在非典型有丝分裂图形分类中表现良好，基于规则的细化可以提升特定指标但需要进一步研究

Abstract: Mitotic figures (MFs) are relevant biomarkers in tumor grading.
Differentiating atypical MFs (AMFs) from normal MFs (NMFs) remains difficult,
as manual annotation is time-consuming and subjective. In this work an ensemble
of ConvNeXtBase models was trained with AUCMEDI and extend with a rule-based
refinement (RBR) module. On the MIDOG25 preliminary test set, the ensemble
achieved a balanced accuracy of 84.02%. While the RBR increased specificity, it
reduced sensitivity and overall performance. The results show that deep
ensembles perform well for AMF classification. RBR can increase specific
metrics but requires further research.

Abstract: In the era of Industry 5.0, monitoring human activity is essential for
ensuring both ergonomic safety and overall well-being. While multi-camera
centralized setups improve pose estimation accuracy, they often suffer from
high computational costs and bandwidth requirements, limiting scalability and
real-time applicability. Distributing processing across edge devices can reduce
network bandwidth and computational load. On the other hand, the constrained
resources of edge devices lead to accuracy degradation, and the distribution of
computation leads to temporal and spatial inconsistencies. We address this
challenge by proposing COMETH (Convex Optimization for Multiview Estimation and
Tracking of Humans), a lightweight algorithm for real-time multi-view human
pose fusion that relies on three concepts: it integrates kinematic and
biomechanical constraints to increase the joint positioning accuracy; it
employs convex optimization-based inverse kinematics for spatial fusion; and it
implements a state observer to improve temporal consistency. We evaluate COMETH
on both public and industrial datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in localization, detection, and tracking accuracy. The proposed fusion
pipeline enables accurate and scalable human motion tracking, making it
well-suited for industrial and safety-critical applications. The code is
publicly available at https://github.com/PARCO-LAB/COMETH.

Abstract: Many high-performance networks were not designed with lightweight application
scenarios in mind from the outset, which has greatly restricted their scope of
application. This paper takes ConvNeXt as the research object and significantly
reduces the parameter scale and network complexity of ConvNeXt by integrating
the Cross Stage Partial Connections mechanism and a series of optimized
designs. The new network is named E-ConvNeXt, which can maintain high accuracy
performance under different complexity configurations. The three core
innovations of E-ConvNeXt are : (1) integrating the Cross Stage Partial Network
(CSPNet) with ConvNeXt and adjusting the network structure, which reduces the
model's network complexity by up to 80%; (2) Optimizing the Stem and Block
structures to enhance the model's feature expression capability and operational
efficiency; (3) Replacing Layer Scale with channel attention. Experimental
validation on ImageNet classification demonstrates E-ConvNeXt's superior
accuracy-efficiency balance: E-ConvNeXt-mini reaches 78.3% Top-1 accuracy at
0.9GFLOPs. E-ConvNeXt-small reaches 81.9% Top-1 accuracy at 3.1GFLOPs. Transfer

Conclusion: 该研究有效解决了图像操纶定位领域的数据稀缺问题，通过网络监督技术显著提升了模型性能，为图像伪造检测提供了可靠的数据支撑和新的研究方向

Abstract: Images manipulated using image editing tools can mislead viewers and pose
significant risks to social security. However, accurately localizing the
manipulated regions within an image remains a challenging problem. One of the
main barriers in this area is the high cost of data acquisition and the severe
lack of high-quality annotated datasets. To address this challenge, we
introduce novel methods that mitigate data scarcity by leveraging readily
available web data. We utilize a large collection of manually forged images
from the web, as well as automatically generated annotations derived from a
simpler auxiliary task, constrained image manipulation localization.
Specifically, we introduce a new paradigm CAAAv2, which automatically and
accurately annotates manipulated regions at the pixel level. To further improve
annotation quality, we propose a novel metric, QES, which filters out
unreliable annotations. Through CAAA v2 and QES, we construct MIMLv2, a
large-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset containing 246,212 manually
forged images with pixel-level mask annotations. This is over 120x larger than
existing handcrafted datasets like IMD20. Additionally, we introduce Object
Jitter, a technique that further enhances model training by generating
high-quality manipulation artifacts. Building on these advances, we develop a
new model, Web-IML, designed to effectively leverage web-scale supervision for
the image manipulation localization task. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach substantially alleviates the data scarcity problem and
significantly improves the performance of various models on multiple real-world
forgery benchmarks. With the proposed web supervision, Web-IML achieves a
striking performance gain of 31% and surpasses previous SOTA TruFor by 24.1
average IoU points. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at

Abstract: Simulating detector responses is a crucial part of understanding the inner
workings of particle collisions in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Such
simulations are currently performed with statistical Monte Carlo methods, which
are computationally expensive and put a significant strain on CERN's
computational grid. Therefore, recent proposals advocate for generative machine
learning methods to enable more efficient simulations. However, the
distribution of the data varies significantly across the simulations, which is
hard to capture with out-of-the-box methods. In this study, we present
ExpertSim - a deep learning simulation approach tailored for the Zero Degree
Calorimeter in the ALICE experiment. Our method utilizes a
Mixture-of-Generative-Experts architecture, where each expert specializes in
simulating a different subset of the data. This allows for a more precise and
efficient generation process, as each expert focuses on a specific aspect of
the calorimeter response. ExpertSim not only improves accuracy, but also
provides a significant speedup compared to the traditional Monte-Carlo methods,
offering a promising solution for high-efficiency detector simulations in
particle physics experiments at CERN. We make the code available at

Conclusion: POSE成功解决了视频扩散生成中的采样效率瓶颈，为大规模视频模型提供了高效的单步生成解决方案，在保持质量的同时显著提升了生成速度。

Abstract: The field of video diffusion generation faces critical bottlenecks in
sampling efficiency, especially for large-scale models and long sequences.
Existing video acceleration methods adopt image-based techniques but suffer
from fundamental limitations: they neither model the temporal coherence of
video frames nor provide single-step distillation for large-scale video models.
To bridge this gap, we propose POSE (Phased One-Step Equilibrium), a
distillation framework that reduces the sampling steps of large-scale video
diffusion models, enabling the generation of high-quality videos in a single
step. POSE employs a carefully designed two-phase process to distill video
models:(i) stability priming: a warm-up mechanism to stabilize adversarial
distillation that adapts the high-quality trajectory of the one-step generator
from high to low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, optimizing the video quality of
single-step mappings near the endpoints of flow trajectories. (ii) unified
adversarial equilibrium: a flexible self-adversarial distillation mechanism
that promotes stable single-step adversarial training towards a Nash
equilibrium within the Gaussian noise space, generating realistic single-step
videos close to real videos. For conditional video generation, we propose (iii)
conditional adversarial consistency, a method to improve both semantic
consistency and frame consistency between conditional frames and generated
frames. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that POSE outperforms other
acceleration methods on VBench-I2V by average 7.15% in semantic alignment,
temporal conference and frame quality, reducing the latency of the pre-trained
model by 100$\times$, from 1000 seconds to 10 seconds, while maintaining
competitive performance.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models enable high-quality image generation but are
computationally expensive. While prior work optimizes per-inference efficiency,
we explore an orthogonal approach: reducing redundancy across correlated
prompts. Our method leverages the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion models,
where early denoising steps capture shared structures among similar prompts. We
propose a training-free approach that clusters prompts based on semantic
similarity and shares computation in early diffusion steps. Experiments show
that for models trained conditioned on image embeddings, our approach
significantly reduces compute cost while improving image quality. By leveraging
UnClip's text-to-image prior, we enhance diffusion step allocation for greater
efficiency. Our method seamlessly integrates with existing pipelines, scales
with prompt sets, and reduces the environmental and financial burden of
large-scale text-to-image generation. Project page:

Abstract: Mitosis detection in histopathology images plays a key role in tumor
assessment. Although machine learning algorithms could be exploited for aiding
physicians in accurately performing such a task, these algorithms suffer from
significative performance drop when evaluated on images coming from domains
that are different from the training ones. In this work, we propose a
Mamba-based approach for mitosis detection under domain shift, inspired by the
promising performance demonstrated by Mamba in medical imaging segmentation
tasks. Specifically, our approach exploits a VM-UNet architecture for carrying
out the addressed task, as well as stain augmentation operations for further
improving model robustness against domain shift. Our approach has been
submitted to the track 1 of the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG)
challenge. Preliminary experiments, conducted on the MIDOG++ dataset, show
large room for improvement for the proposed method.

Abstract: Recognizing atypical mitotic figures in histopathology images allows
physicians to correctly assess tumor aggressiveness. Although machine learning
models could be exploited for automatically performing such a task, under
domain shift these models suffer from significative performance drops. In this
work, an approach based on multi-task learning is proposed for addressing this

object to classify, ignoring the domain varying background of the image. The
proposed approach shows promising performance in a preliminary evaluation

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FW-GAN是一个基于频率感知的单样本手写合成框架，通过Wave-MLP和频率引导判别器生成高质量、风格一致的手写文本，解决了传统方法在长距离依赖和频率信息建模方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手写合成方法主要基于传统卷积架构，难以建模长距离依赖和复杂笔画模式，且忽视了频率信息在捕捉精细风格细节中的关键作用。

Method: 提出FW-GAN框架，包含相位感知Wave-MLP生成器来捕捉空间关系并保留风格线索，频率引导判别器利用高频成分增强真实性检测，以及新颖的频率分布损失来对齐合成与真实手写的频率特征。

Result: 在越南语和英语手写数据集上的实验表明，FW-GAN能够生成高质量、风格一致的手写文本，有效增强低资源手写识别系统的数据。

Conclusion: FW-GAN通过频率感知方法显著提升了手写合成的真实性和风格一致性，为低资源手写识别提供了有效的数据增强工具。

Abstract: Labeled handwriting data is often scarce, limiting the effectiveness of
recognition systems that require diverse, style-consistent training samples.
Handwriting synthesis offers a promising solution by generating artificial data
to augment training. However, current methods face two major limitations.
First, most are built on conventional convolutional architectures, which
struggle to model long-range dependencies and complex stroke patterns. Second,
they largely ignore the crucial role of frequency information, which is
essential for capturing fine-grained stylistic and structural details in
handwriting. To address these challenges, we propose FW-GAN, a one-shot
handwriting synthesis framework that generates realistic, writer-consistent
text from a single example. Our generator integrates a phase-aware Wave-MLP to
better capture spatial relationships while preserving subtle stylistic cues. We
further introduce a frequency-guided discriminator that leverages
high-frequency components to enhance the authenticity detection of generated
samples. Additionally, we introduce a novel Frequency Distribution Loss that
aligns the frequency characteristics of synthetic and real handwriting, thereby
enhancing visual fidelity. Experiments on Vietnamese and English handwriting
datasets demonstrate that FW-GAN generates high-quality, style-consistent
handwriting, making it a valuable tool for augmenting data in low-resource
handwriting recognition (HTR) pipelines. Official implementation is available

Motivation: 当前视频大语言模型的视觉token过多导致计算负担重，现有方法未考虑视频帧的动态特性和时间依赖性

Method: 提出两阶段方法：1)基于帧相似性分割视频并动态分配token预算；2)使用时序引导的DPC算法联合建模帧间独特性和帧内多样性

Result: 在LLaVA-OneVision-7B上保持99.5%原始性能，减少75%视觉token，预填充阶段加速3.9倍

Conclusion: MMG-Vid能最大化有限token预算的利用率，显著提高效率同时保持强性能

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) excel in video understanding, but their
excessive visual tokens pose a significant computational challenge for
real-world applications. Current methods aim to enhance inference efficiency by
visual token pruning. However, they do not consider the dynamic characteristics
and temporal dependencies of video frames, as they perceive video understanding
as a multi-frame task. To address these challenges, we propose MMG-Vid, a novel
training-free visual token pruning framework that removes redundancy by
Maximizing Marginal Gains at both segment-level and token-level. Specifically,
we first divide the video into segments based on frame similarity, and then
dynamically allocate the token budget for each segment to maximize the marginal
gain of each segment. Subsequently, we propose a temporal-guided DPC algorithm
that jointly models inter-frame uniqueness and intra-frame diversity, thereby
maximizing the marginal gain of each token. By combining both stages, MMG-Vid
can maximize the utilization of the limited token budget, significantly
improving efficiency while maintaining strong performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MMG-Vid can maintain over 99.5% of the original
performance, while effectively reducing 75% visual tokens and accelerating the
prefilling stage by 3.9x on LLaVA-OneVision-7B. Code will be released soon.

Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言-动作模型需要大量后训练，计算开销大，限制了可扩展性和部署能力。受人类多模态协调启发，需要更高效的框架。

Method: 采用3阶段渐进架构：1) EFA-Routing在视觉编码器中注入指令信息选择性聚合视觉token；2) LFP-Routing在语言模型中引入动作意图并剪枝无关token；3) V-L-A耦合注意力结合因果视觉-语言注意力和双向动作并行解码。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试和真实机器人任务中分别达到97.4%和70.0%的成功率，训练成本减少2.5倍，推理延迟降低2.8倍。

Conclusion: CogVLA通过认知对齐设计实现了高效且高性能的视觉-语言-动作建模，为实际部署提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built on pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) require extensive post-training, resulting in
high computational overhead that limits scalability and deployment.We propose
CogVLA, a Cognition-Aligned Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages
instruction-driven routing and sparsification to improve both efficiency and
performance. CogVLA draws inspiration from human multimodal coordination and
introduces a 3-stage progressive architecture. 1) Encoder-FiLM based
Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instruction information into the
vision encoder to selectively aggregate and compress dual-stream visual tokens,
forming a instruction-aware latent representation. 2) Building upon this
compact visual encoding, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing)
introduces action intent into the language model by pruning
instruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens, thereby achieving token-level
sparsity. 3) To ensure that compressed perception inputs can still support
accurate and coherent action generation, we introduce V-L-A Coupled Attention
(CAtten), which combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional
action parallel decoding. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and
real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art
performance with success rates of 97.4% and 70.0%, respectively, while reducing
training costs by 2.5-fold and decreasing inference latency by 2.8-fold
compared to OpenVLA. CogVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at

Method: 提出HydraFake数据集和Veritas检测器，采用模式感知推理（规划和自我反思）模拟人类取证过程，两阶段训练管道

Result: 实验显示先前检测器在跨模型场景泛化良好，但在未见伪造和数据域表现不足，Veritas在不同OOD场景取得显著提升

Conclusion: HydraFake数据集和Veritas检测器有效解决了真实世界深度伪造检测的挑战，提供透明可信的检测输出

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a formidable challenge due to the complex and
evolving nature of fake content in real-world scenarios. However, existing
academic benchmarks suffer from severe discrepancies from industrial practice,
typically featuring homogeneous training sources and low-quality testing
images, which hinder the practical deployments of current detectors. To
mitigate this gap, we introduce HydraFake, a dataset that simulates real-world
challenges with hierarchical generalization testing. Specifically, HydraFake
involves diversified deepfake techniques and in-the-wild forgeries, along with
rigorous training and evaluation protocol, covering unseen model architectures,
emerging forgery techniques and novel data domains. Building on this resource,
we propose Veritas, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) based deepfake
detector. Different from vanilla chain-of-thought (CoT), we introduce
pattern-aware reasoning that involves critical reasoning patterns such as
"planning" and "self-reflection" to emulate human forensic process. We further
propose a two-stage training pipeline to seamlessly internalize such deepfake
reasoning capacities into current MLLMs. Experiments on HydraFake dataset
reveal that although previous detectors show great generalization on
cross-model scenarios, they fall short on unseen forgeries and data domains.
Our Veritas achieves significant gains across different OOD scenarios, and is
capable of delivering transparent and faithful detection outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度伪造检测方法主要针对完全合成的视频，而局部修改的深度伪造（如修改面部表情、替换物体、背景修改）与真实元素无缝融合，具有更强的欺骗性且难以检测，现有检测能力存在重要空白。

Method: 提出了FakePartsBench，首个专门针对局部深度伪造的大规模基准数据集，包含超过25,000个视频，提供像素级和帧级操作标注，用于全面评估检测方法。通过用户研究验证检测难度。

Result: 用户研究表明，FakeParts相比传统深度伪造将人类检测准确率降低了30%以上，最先进的检测模型也出现类似的性能下降。证明了当前深度伪造检测方法在面对局部修改时的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了当前深度伪造检测方法的重要漏洞，并为开发针对局部视频操作的更鲁棒检测方法提供了必要的资源和基准数据集。

Abstract: We introduce FakeParts, a new class of deepfakes characterized by subtle,
localized manipulations to specific spatial regions or temporal segments of
otherwise authentic videos. Unlike fully synthetic content, these partial
manipulations, ranging from altered facial expressions to object substitutions
and background modifications, blend seamlessly with real elements, making them
particularly deceptive and difficult to detect. To address the critical gap in
detection capabilities, we present FakePartsBench, the first large-scale
benchmark dataset specifically designed to capture the full spectrum of partial
deepfakes. Comprising over 25K videos with pixel-level and frame-level
manipulation annotations, our dataset enables comprehensive evaluation of
detection methods. Our user studies demonstrate that FakeParts reduces human
detection accuracy by over 30% compared to traditional deepfakes, with similar
performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art detection models. This
work identifies an urgent vulnerability in current deepfake detection
approaches and provides the necessary resources to develop more robust methods
for partial video manipulations.

Method: 使用已知摄像机姿态和深度信息，将多视角特征融合成统一点云，采用k近邻相关性和基于transformer的更新机制来估计长程3D对应关系

Result: 在Panoptic Studio和DexYCB两个真实数据集上达到中位轨迹误差分别为3.1cm和2.0cm，能够良好地泛化到1-8个摄像头的各种视角配置和24-150帧的视频长度

Conclusion: 该方法为多视角3D跟踪研究设置了新标准，并为实际应用提供了实用工具，通过释放跟踪器和数据集来推动该领域的发展

Abstract: We introduce the first data-driven multi-view 3D point tracker, designed to
track arbitrary points in dynamic scenes using multiple camera views. Unlike
existing monocular trackers, which struggle with depth ambiguities and
occlusion, or prior multi-camera methods that require over 20 cameras and
tedious per-sequence optimization, our feed-forward model directly predicts 3D
correspondences using a practical number of cameras (e.g., four), enabling
robust and accurate online tracking. Given known camera poses and either
sensor-based or estimated multi-view depth, our tracker fuses multi-view
features into a unified point cloud and applies k-nearest-neighbors correlation
alongside a transformer-based update to reliably estimate long-range 3D
correspondences, even under occlusion. We train on 5K synthetic multi-view
Kubric sequences and evaluate on two real-world benchmarks: Panoptic Studio and
DexYCB, achieving median trajectory errors of 3.1 cm and 2.0 cm, respectively.
Our method generalizes well to diverse camera setups of 1-8 views with varying
vantage points and video lengths of 24-150 frames. By releasing our tracker
alongside training and evaluation datasets, we aim to set a new standard for
multi-view 3D tracking research and provide a practical tool for real-world
applications. Project page available at https://ethz-vlg.github.io/mvtracker.

Conclusion: OneReward框架证明了使用单一奖励模型可以有效提升多任务生成能力，为处理多样化数据和任务目标提供了高效的统一解决方案，消除了对任务特定SFT的依赖。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OneReward, a unified reinforcement learning
framework that enhances the model's generative capabilities across multiple
tasks under different evaluation criteria using only \textit{One Reward} model.
By employing a single vision-language model (VLM) as the generative reward
model, which can distinguish the winner and loser for a given task and a given
evaluation criterion, it can be effectively applied to multi-task generation
models, particularly in contexts with varied data and diverse task objectives.
We utilize OneReward for mask-guided image generation, which can be further
divided into several sub-tasks such as image fill, image extend, object
removal, and text rendering, involving a binary mask as the edit area. Although
these domain-specific tasks share same conditioning paradigm, they differ
significantly in underlying data distributions and evaluation metrics. Existing
methods often rely on task-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which limits
generalization and training efficiency. Building on OneReward, we develop
Seedream 3.0 Fill, a mask-guided generation model trained via multi-task
reinforcement learning directly on a pre-trained base model, eliminating the
need for task-specific SFT. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified
edit model consistently outperforms both commercial and open-source

Conclusion: 该方法成功展示了现有水印技术的脆弱性，希望激发更鲁棒水印方法的发展

Abstract: Content watermarking is an important tool for the authentication and
copyright protection of digital media. However, it is unclear whether existing
watermarks are robust against adversarial attacks. We present the winning
solution to the NeurIPS 2024 Erasing the Invisible challenge, which
stress-tests watermark robustness under varying degrees of adversary knowledge.
The challenge consisted of two tracks: a black-box and beige-box track,
depending on whether the adversary knows which watermarking method was used by
the provider. For the beige-box track, we leverage an adaptive VAE-based
evasion attack, with a test-time optimization and color-contrast restoration in
CIELAB space to preserve the image's quality. For the black-box track, we first
cluster images based on their artifacts in the spatial or frequency-domain.
Then, we apply image-to-image diffusion models with controlled noise injection
and semantic priors from ChatGPT-generated captions to each cluster with
optimized parameter settings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method
successfully achieves near-perfect watermark removal (95.7%) with negligible
impact on the residual image's quality. We hope that our attacks inspire the
development of more robust image watermarking methods.
