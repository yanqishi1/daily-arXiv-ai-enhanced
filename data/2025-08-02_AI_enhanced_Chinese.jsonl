These channels enable the anonymous trade of\nillicit goods including drugs, weapons, and stolen credentials. Detecting and\ncategorizing such content remains challenging due to limited labeled data, the\nevolving nature of illicit language, and the structural heterogeneity of online\nsources. This paper presents a hierarchical classification framework that\ncombines fine-tuned language models with a semi-supervised ensemble learning\nstrategy to detect and classify illicit marketplace content across diverse\nplatforms. We extract semantic representations using ModernBERT, a transformer\nmodel for long documents, finetuned on domain-specific data from deep and dark\nweb pages, Telegram channels, Subreddits, and Pastebin pastes to capture\nspecialized jargon and ambiguous linguistic patterns. In addition, we\nincorporate manually engineered features such as document structure, embedded\npatterns including Bitcoin addresses, emails, and IPs, and metadata, which\ncomplement language model embeddings. The classification pipeline operates in\ntwo stages. The first stage uses a semi-supervised ensemble of XGBoost, Random\nForest, and SVM with entropy-based weighted voting to detect sales-related\ndocuments. The second stage further classifies these into drug, weapon, or\ncredential sales. Experiments on three datasets, including our multi-source\ncorpus, DUTA, and CoDA, show that our model outperforms several baselines,\nincluding BERT, ModernBERT, DarkBERT, ALBERT, Longformer, and BigBird.

Synthetic\ndata methods are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering\nreal-world data, but they demand a high degree of realism and controllability\nto be useful. This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data\ngeneration in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and\nAnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal\nObject Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and\ncontrollable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated\nsimultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI\nenables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a\nspecified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic\nconsistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods\nthat rely solely on edit masks, this approach uses 3D bounding box conditioning\nto ensure accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. AnydoorMed\nextends this paradigm to the medical imaging domain, focusing on\nreference-guided inpainting for mammography scans. It leverages a\ndiffusion-based model to inpaint anomalies with impressive detail preservation,\nmaintaining the reference anomaly's structural integrity while semantically\nblending it with the surrounding tissue. Together, these methods demonstrate\nthat foundation models for reference-guided inpainting in natural images can be\nreadily adapted to diverse perceptual modalities, paving the way for the next\ngeneration of systems capable of constructing highly realistic, controllable\nand multimodal counterfactual scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5MObI\u548cAnydoorMed\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u548c\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "method": "MObI\u5229\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u8c61\u4fee\u590d\uff0cAnydoorMed\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4fee\u590d\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "result": "\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u5ea6\u771f\u5b9e\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

To address these bottlenecks, we propose our training-free method,\nEnriched-FineR (or E-FineR for short), which demonstrates state-of-the-art\nresults in fine-grained visual recognition while also offering greater\ninterpretability, highlighting its strong potential in real-world scenarios and\nnew domains where expert annotations are difficult to obtain. Additionally, we\ndemonstrate the application of our proposed approach to zero-shot and few-shot\nclassification, where it demonstrated performance on par with the existing SOTA\nwhile being training-free and not requiring human interventions. Overall, our\nvocabulary-free framework supports the shift in image classification from rigid\nlabel prediction to flexible, language-driven understanding, enabling scalable\nand generalizable systems for real-world applications.

To address these challenges, we\nintroduce a fully end-to-end training framework that distills a 1D\nidentity-agnostic latent motion descriptor from driving image, effectively\ncontrolling motion through cross-attention during image generation. Our\nimplicit motion descriptor captures expressive facial motion in fine detail,\nlearned end-to-end from a diverse video dataset without reliance on pretrained\nmotion detectors. We further enhance expressiveness and disentangle motion\nlatents from identity cues by supervising their learning with a dual GAN\ndecoder, alongside spatial and color augmentations.

Many of these students take online courses, where peer feedback is\nused to engage students and improve pedagogy in a scalable manner.

This paper examines how native versus non-native English speaker\nstatus affects three metrics of peer feedback experience in online U.S.-based\ncomputing courses. Using the Twitter-roBERTa-based model, we analyze the\nsentiment of peer reviews written by and to a random sample of 500 students.

Results show that native English speakers rate feedback less\nfavorably, while non-native speakers write more positively but receive less\npositive sentiment in return.

To address the above challenges, we propose an adversarial-guided\ndiffusion (AGD) approach for adversarial attack MLLMs. We introduce\nadversarial-guided noise to ensure attack efficacy. A key observation in our\ndesign is that, unlike most traditional adversarial attacks which embed\nhigh-frequency perturbations directly into the clean image, AGD injects target\nsemantics into the noise component of the reverse diffusion. Since the added\nnoise in a diffusion model spans the entire frequency spectrum, the adversarial\nsignal embedded within it also inherits this full-spectrum property.\nImportantly, during reverse diffusion, the adversarial image is formed as a\nlinear combination of the clean image and the noise. Thus, when applying\ndefenses such as a simple low-pass filtering, which act independently on each\ncomponent, the adversarial image within the noise component is less likely to\nbe suppressed, as it is not confined to the high-frequency band.

However, mapping a comprehensive and detailed\nCN atlas is challenging because of the unique anatomical structures of each CN\npair and the complexity of the skull base environment.In this work, we present\nwhat we believe to be the first study to develop a comprehensive diffusion\ntractography atlas for automated mapping of CN pathways in the human brain. The\nCN atlas is generated by fiber clustering by using the streamlines generated by\nmulti-parametric fiber tractography for each pair of CNs. Instead of disposable\nclustering, we explore a new strategy of multi-stage fiber clustering for\nmultiple analysis of approximately 1,000,000 streamlines generated from the 50\nsubjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Quantitative and visual\nexperiments demonstrate that our CN atlas achieves high spatial correspondence\nwith expert manual annotations on multiple acquisition sites, including the HCP\ndataset, the Multi-shell Diffusion MRI (MDM) dataset and two clinical cases of\npituitary adenoma patients. The proposed CN atlas can automatically identify 8\nfiber bundles associated with 5 pairs of CNs, including the optic nerve CN II,\noculomotor nerve CN III, trigeminal nerve CN V and facial-vestibulocochlear\nnerve CN VII/VIII, and its robustness is demonstrated experimentally.

To address this issue, we\npropose the time series Geometric Structure Index (TGSI), a novel evaluation\nmetric that transforms time series into images to leverage their inherent\ntwo-dimensional geometric representations. However, since the image\ntransformation process is non-differentiable, TGSI cannot be directly\nintegrated as a training loss. We further introduce the Shape-Aware Temporal\nLoss (SATL), a multi-component loss function operating in the time series\nmodality to bridge this gap and enhance structure modeling during training.\nSATL combines three components: a first-order difference loss that measures\nstructural consistency through the MSE between first-order differences, a\nfrequency domain loss that captures essential periodic patterns using the Fast\nFourier Transform while minimizing noise, and a perceptual feature loss that\nmeasures geometric structure difference in time-series by aligning temporal\nfeatures with geometric structure features through a pre-trained temporal\nfeature extractor and time-series image autoencoder. Experiments across\nmultiple datasets demonstrate that models trained with SATL achieve superior\nperformance in both MSE and the proposed TGSI metrics compared to baseline\nmethods, without additional computational cost during inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807TGSI\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570SATL\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u503c\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982MSE\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTGSI\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1SATL\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u9636\u5dee\u5206\u635f\u5931\u3001\u9891\u57df\u635f\u5931\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u5f81\u635f\u5931\uff09\u4ee5\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u589e\u5f3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528SATL\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728MSE\u548cTGSI\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u65e0\u989d\u5916\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "TGSI\u548cSATL\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Previous CLIP-based unified methods\noften require additional diffusion decoders or quantization to support\nreconstruction and generation tasks, leading to inconsistent reconstruction or\ndegradation of original comprehension performance.In contrast, we introduce a\ntwo-stage training scheme and a self-distillation strategy that progressively\nintegrates reconstruction capabilities into CLIP, allowing it to maintain\noriginal comprehension performance while achieving effective image\nreconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a dual-condition architecture to\nconnect the MLLM and diffusion transformer, using both learnable queries and\nthe last layer multimodal hidden states as joint conditions. This method not\nonly enables the utilization of the MLLM's strong reasoning capabilities in\ngeneration tasks, but also maximizes the exploitation of the rich information\nin UniLIP features during editing tasks.

However, existing SSCOD methods based on\nTeacher-Student frameworks suffer from severe prediction bias and error\npropagation under scarce supervision, while their multi-network architectures\nincur high computational overhead and limited scalability. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose ST-SAM, a highly annotation-efficient yet concise\nframework that breaks away from conventional SSCOD constraints. Specifically,\nST-SAM employs Self-Training strategy that dynamically filters and expands\nhigh-confidence pseudo-labels to enhance a single-model architecture, thereby\nfundamentally circumventing inter-model prediction bias. Furthermore, by\ntransforming pseudo-labels into hybrid prompts containing domain-specific\nknowledge, ST-SAM effectively harnesses the Segment Anything Model's potential\nfor specialized tasks to mitigate error accumulation in self-training.\nExperiments on COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-SAM achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance with only 1\\% labeled data, outperforming existing\nSSCOD methods and even matching fully supervised methods. Remarkably, ST-SAM\nrequires training only a single network, without relying on specific models or\nloss functions. This work establishes a new paradigm for annotation-efficient\nSSCOD.

These metrics can be used in quantitative bias analyses to assess the\nrobustness of results for an inferential study given potential bias from\noutcome misclassification. However, extensive time and resource allocation are\ntypically re-quired to create reference-standard labels through manual chart\nreview of free-text notes from linked electronic health records. Methods: We\ndescribe an expedited process that introduces efficiency in a validation study\nus-ing two distinct mechanisms: 1) use of natural language processing (NLP) to\nreduce time spent by human reviewers to review each chart, and 2) a multi-wave\nadaptive sampling approach with pre-defined criteria to stop the validation\nstudy once performance characteristics are identified with sufficient\nprecision. We illustrate this process in a case study that validates the\nperformance of a claims-based outcome algorithm for intentional self-harm in\npatients with obesity. Results: We empirically demonstrate that the\nNLP-assisted annotation process reduced the time spent on review per chart by\n40% and use of the pre-defined stopping rule with multi-wave samples would have\nprevented review of 77% of patient charts with limited compromise to precision\nin derived measurement characteristics.

We introduce an\ninstance-aware attention mechanism guided by shape-prior features, then\nconstruct a data-driven shape template space that encodes low-dimensional\nrepresentations of road elements, enabling clustering to generate anchor points\nas reference priors. We design a diffusion-based framework that leverages these\nprior anchors to generate accurate and complete predictions.

Diverging from critical traditions that conflate\narbitrariness with injustice, it posits arbitrariness as a semiotic trait: a\nproperty enabling systems - linguistic, legal, or social - to operate\neffectively while withholding their internal rationale. Building on Ferdinand\nde Saussure's concept of l'arbitraire du signe, the analysis extends this\nprinciple beyond language to demonstrate its cross-domain applicability,\nparticularly in law and social dynamics. The paper introduces the \"Motivation\n-> Constatability -> Contestability\" chain, arguing that motivation functions\nas a crucial interface rendering an act's logic vulnerable to intersubjective\ncontestation. When this chain is broken through mechanisms like\n\"immotivization\" or \"Conflict Lateralization\" (exemplified by \"the blur of the\nwolf drowned in the fish\"), acts produce binding effects without exposing their\nrationale, thus precluding justiciability. This structural opacity, while\nappearing illogical, is a deliberate design protecting authority from\naccountability. Drawing on Shannon's entropy model, the paper formalizes\narbitrariness as A = H(L|M) (conditional entropy). It thereby proposes a modern\ntheory of arbitrariness as a neutral operator central to control as well as\ncare, an overlooked dimension of interpersonal relations.

To assess appropriateness for\nreal-time applications, each model is assessed not only in terms of Top-1 and\nTop-5 classification accuracy, but also in terms of inference time, parameter\ncount, model size, and frames-per-second (FPS) on a GPU-accelerated edge\ndeployment simulation. Results demonstrate that cosine learning rate decay and\nadjustable batch size may greatly boost both accuracy and convergence speed,\nwhile keeping low latency and memory cost.

Current technologies face two significant challenges: first,\nthe traffic sign dataset exhibits a pronounced long-tail distribution,\nresulting in a substantial decline in recognition performance of traditional\nconvolutional networks when processing low-frequency and out-of-distribution\nclasses; second, traffic signs in real-world scenarios are predominantly small\ntargets with significant scale variations, making it difficult to extract\nmulti-scale features.To overcome these issues, we propose a novel two-stage\nframework combining open-vocabulary detection and cross-modal learning. For\ntraffic sign detection, our NanoVerse YOLO model integrates a reparameterizable\nvision-language path aggregation network (RepVL-PAN) and an SPD-Conv module to\nspecifically enhance feature extraction for small, multi-scale targets. For\ntraffic sign classification, we designed a Traffic Sign Recognition Multimodal\nContrastive Learning model (TSR-MCL).

We study implicit user feedback in two user-LM\ninteraction datasets (WildChat and LMSYS). First, we analyze user feedback in\nthe user-LLM conversation trajectory, providing insights into when and why such\nfeedback occurs. Second, we study harvesting learning signals from such\nimplicit user feedback. We find that the contents of user feedback (e.g., user\nwanted clarification), not just the polarity (e.g., users were unhappy with the\nprevious model response), can improve model performance in short human-designed\nquestions (MTBench) but not on longer and more complex questions (WildBench).\nWe also find that the usefulness of user feedback is largely tied to the\nquality of the user's initial prompt.

Recent efforts from natural language processing (NLP) have\nshown the effectiveness of layer pruning, offering a plausible training-free\ncompression solution. However, due to the modality divergence between vision\nand language, it is unclear whether these NLP techniques are still effective in\nLVLMs. In this paper, we empirically prove that directly applying these layer\npruning methods to LVLMs is ineffective. Through extensive experiments, we find\nthat non-essential vision-language (VL) tokens and inter-layer feature gaps\npose critical challenges to pruning layers in LVLMs. Based on these insights,\nwe propose a novel framework Short-LVLM (SVL) that can utilize important VL\ntokens and mitigate the layer-wise feature gaps. Notably, Short-LVLM not only\nachieves a superior trade-off between performance and efficiency but also\nexhibits several potential advantages, i.e., training-free, model-agnostic, and\nhighly compatible.

However, current\nvision-language pretraining methods in the medical domain often simplify\nclinical reports into single entities or fragmented tokens, ignoring their\ninherent structure. In addition, contrastive learning frameworks typically\ndepend on large quantities of hard negative samples, which is impractical for\nsmall-scale medical datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose Adaptive\nGrouped Alignment (AGA), a new framework that captures structured semantics\nfrom paired medical images and reports. AGA introduces a bidirectional grouping\nmechanism based on a sparse similarity matrix. For each image-report pair, we\ncompute fine-grained similarities between text tokens and image patches. Each\ntoken selects its top-matching patches to form a visual group, and each patch\nselects its most related tokens to form a language group. To enable adaptive\ngrouping, we design two threshold gating modules, called Language Grouped\nThreshold Gate and Vision Grouped Threshold Gate, which learn grouping\nthresholds dynamically. Group representations are computed as weighted averages\nbased on similarity scores. To align each token with its group representation,\nwe introduce an Instance Aware Group Alignment loss that operates within each\nimage-text pair, removing the need for external negatives. Finally, a\nBidirectional Cross-modal Grouped Alignment module is applied to enhance\nfine-grained alignment between visual and linguistic group representations.\nExtensive experiments on public and private datasets show that our method\nachieves strong performance on image-text retrieval and classification tasks\nunder both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u7ec4\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08AGA\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u62a5\u544a\u4e2d\u6355\u83b7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u62a5\u544a\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5bf9\u5927\u91cf\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\u3002", "method": "AGA\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u5206\u7ec4\u673a\u5236\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7ec4\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5b9e\u4f8b\u611f\u77e5\u7ec4\u5bf9\u9f50\u635f\u5931\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u7ec4\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u548c\u79c1\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAGA\u5728\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002", "conclusion": "AGA\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u62a5\u544a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

In the second step, we utilize the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\nmodel to classify the honey botanical origin in the first subsystem and\nidentify the adulteration level in the second subsystem. We assess the proposed\nsystem performance on a public honey hyperspectral image dataset. The result\nindicates that the proposed system can detect adulteration in honey with an\noverall cross-validation accuracy of 96.39%, making it an appropriate\nalternative to the current chemical-based detection methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8702\u871c\u63ba\u5047\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LDA\u548cKNN\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8702\u871c\u6765\u6e90\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u63ba\u5047\u6d53\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe96.39%\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u8702\u871c\u63ba\u7cd6\u6d46\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\uff1a1\uff09\u8702\u871c\u6765\u6e90\u5206\u7c7b\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c2\uff09\u63ba\u5047\u68c0\u6d4b\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u5747\u91c7\u7528LDA\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\uff0cKNN\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u6d53\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a96.39%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u5316\u5b66\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

However,\na comprehensive investigation of the individual and joint effects of spectral\nand spatial compression on learning-based HSI compression has not been\nthoroughly examined yet. Conducting such an analysis is crucial for\nunderstanding how the exploitation of spectral, spatial, and joint\nspatio-spectral redundancies affects HSI compression. To address this issue, we\npropose Adjustable Spatio-Spectral Hyperspectral Image Compression Network\n(HyCASS), a learning-based model designed for adjustable HSI compression in\nboth spectral and spatial dimensions. HyCASS consists of six main modules: 1)\nspectral encoder; 2) spatial encoder; 3) compression ratio (CR) adapter\nencoder; 4) CR adapter decoder; 5) spatial decoder; and 6) spectral decoder\nmodule. The modules employ convolutional layers and transformer blocks to\ncapture both short-range and long-range redundancies.

To address these issues, we introduce Multimodal\nPlanning with Complex Constraints (MPCC), the first benchmark to systematically\nevaluate MLLMs' ability to handle multimodal constraints in planning. To\naddress the first challenge, MPCC focuses on three real-world tasks: Flight\nPlanning, Calendar Planning, and Meeting Planning.

In this work, we propose Causal2Vec, a general-purpose\nembedding model tailored to enhance the performance of decoder-only LLMs\nwithout altering their original architectures or introducing significant\ncomputational overhead. Specifically, we first employ a lightweight BERT-style\nmodel to pre-encode the input text into a single Contextual token, which is\nthen prepended to the LLM's input sequence, allowing each token to capture\ncontextualized information even without attending to future tokens.\nFurthermore, to mitigate the recency bias introduced by last-token pooling and\nhelp LLMs better leverage the semantic information encoded in the Contextual\ntoken, we concatenate the last hidden states of Contextual and EOS tokens as\nthe final text embedding.

To date, research has\nprimarily focused on addressing statistical heterogeneity and communication\nefficiency, through which FL has achieved success in classification tasks.\nHowever, its application to non-classification tasks, such as human pose\nestimation, remains underexplored. This paper identifies and investigates a\ncritical issue termed ``resolution-drift,'' where performance degrades\nsignificantly due to resolution variability across clients. Unlike class-level\nheterogeneity, resolution drift highlights the importance of resolution as\nanother axis of not independent or identically distributed (non-IID) data. To\naddress this issue, we present resolution-adaptive federated learning (RAF), a\nmethod that leverages heatmap-based knowledge distillation.

Most 3D\ndata simulation methods inject predefined physical priors but struggle to\ncapture the full complexity of real data. An optimal approach involves learning\nan implicit mapping from synthetic to realistic data in a data-driven manner,\nbut progress in this solution has met stagnation in recent studies. This work\nexplores a new solution path of data-driven 3D simulation, called\nStable-Sim2Real, based on a novel two-stage depth diffusion model. The initial\nstage finetunes Stable-Diffusion to generate the residual between the real and\nsynthetic paired depth, producing a stable but coarse depth, where some local\nregions may deviate from realistic patterns. To enhance this, both the\nsynthetic and initial output depth are fed into a second-stage diffusion, where\ndiffusion loss is adjusted to prioritize these distinct areas identified by a\n3D discriminator. We provide a new benchmark scheme to evaluate 3D data\nsimulation methods. Extensive experiments show that training the network with\nthe 3D simulated data derived from our method significantly enhances\nperformance in real-world 3D visual tasks.

Additionally, current methods rely\nheavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which can cause models to memorize\nexisting problem-solving pathways, thereby restricting their generalization\nability when confronted with novel problem contexts. Furthermore, while some\nstudies have explored to improve retrieval-augmented reasoning in general\ndomains via reinforcement learning, their reward function designs do not\nadequately capture the specific demands of the medical domain.

Recent studies\ndemonstrate that frequency features can not only enhance feature representation\nto compensate for appearance limitations but also perceive motion through\ndynamic variations in frequency energy. Furthermore, the emerging state space\nmodel called Mamba, enables efficient perception of motion cues in frame\nsequences due to its linear-time long-sequence modeling capability. Motivated\nby this, we propose a novel visual camouflage Mamba (Vcamba) based on\nspatio-frequency motion perception that integrates frequency and spatial\nfeatures for efficient and accurate VCOD. Specifically, we propose a receptive\nfield visual state space (RFVSS) module to extract multi-scale spatial features\nafter sequence modeling. For frequency learning, we introduce an adaptive\nfrequency component enhancement (AFE) module with a novel frequency-domain\nsequential scanning strategy to maintain semantic consistency. Then we propose\na space-based long-range motion perception (SLMP) module and a frequency-based\nlong-range motion perception (FLMP) module to model spatio-temporal and\nfrequency-temporal sequences in spatial and frequency phase domains. Finally,\nthe space and frequency motion fusion module (SFMF) integrates dual-domain\nfeatures for unified motion representation.

Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction demonstrate\nphotorealistic novel view synthesis, highlighting the potential of generating\ndriving data from images captured on the road. This paper introduces a novel\nmethod, I2V-GS, to transfer the Infrastructure view To the Vehicle view with\nGaussian Splatting. Reconstruction from sparse infrastructure viewpoints and\nrendering under large view transformations is a challenging problem. We adopt\nthe adaptive depth warp to generate dense training views. To further expand the\nrange of views, we employ a cascade strategy to inpaint warped images, which\nalso ensures inpainting content is consistent across views.

Methods that use this approach combine\nthe power and flexibility of the functional map framework, with data-driven\nlearning for improved accuracy and generality. However, most existing methods\nin this area restrict the learning aspect only to the feature functions and\nstill rely on axiomatic modeling for formulating the training loss or for\nfunctional map regularization inside the networks. This limits both the\naccuracy and the applicability of the resulting approaches only to scenarios\nwhere assumptions of the axiomatic models hold. In this work, we show, for the\nfirst time, that both in-network regularization and functional map training can\nbe replaced with data-driven methods. For this, we first train a generative\nmodel of functional maps in the spectral domain using score-based generative\nmodeling, built from a large collection of high-quality maps. We then exploit\nthe resulting model to promote the structural properties of ground truth\nfunctional maps on new shape collections. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the\nlearned models are category-agnostic, and can fully replace commonly used\nstrategies such as enforcing Laplacian commutativity or orthogonality of\nfunctional maps. Our key technical contribution is a novel distillation\nstrategy from diffusion models in the spectral domain.

We believe that the\nvarious details discussed in this paper, along with our successes and failures,\nnot only clarify the construction of grounding models but also benefit other\nperception tasks.

Prior work often requires dense multi-view captures with hundreds of\ncalibrated cameras (e.g. Panoptic Studio). Such multi-view setups are\nprohibitively expensive to build and cannot capture diverse scenes in-the-wild.\nIn contrast, we aim to reconstruct dynamic human behaviors, such as repairing a\nbike or dancing, from a small set of sparse-view cameras with complete scene\ncoverage (e.g. four equidistant inward-facing static cameras). We find that\ndense multi-view reconstruction methods struggle to adapt to this sparse-view\nsetup due to limited overlap between viewpoints. To address these limitations,\nwe carefully align independent monocular reconstructions of each camera to\nproduce time- and view-consistent dynamic scene reconstructions.
