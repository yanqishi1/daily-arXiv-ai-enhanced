Transfer-based\nattacks create adversarial examples for surrogate models and transfer these\nexamples to target models under black-box scenarios. Recent studies reveal that\nadversarial examples in flat loss landscapes exhibit superior transferability\nto alleviate overfitting on surrogate models. However, the prior arts overlook\nthe influence of perturbation directions, resulting in limited transferability.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel attack method, named Residual Perturbation\nAttack (ResPA), relying on the residual gradient as the perturbation direction\nto guide the adversarial examples toward the flat regions of the loss function.\nSpecifically, ResPA conducts an exponential moving average on the input\ngradients to obtain the first moment as the reference gradient, which\nencompasses the direction of historical gradients. Instead of heavily relying\non the local flatness that stems from the current gradients as the perturbation\ndirection, ResPA further considers the residual between the current gradient\nand the reference gradient to capture the changes in the global perturbation\ndirection. The experimental results demonstrate the better transferability of\nResPA than the existing typical transfer-based attack methods, while the\ntransferability can be further improved by combining ResPA with the current\ninput transformation methods.

Among them, the Swin\nTransformer stands out for its ability to capture hierarchical, multi-scale\nrepresentations, making it a popular backbone for segmentation in videos.\nHowever, despite its window-attention scheme, it still incurs a high\ncomputational cost, especially in larger variants commonly used for dense\nprediction in videos. This remains a major bottleneck for real-time,\nresource-constrained applications. Whilst token reduction methods have been\nproposed to alleviate this, the window-based attention mechanism of Swin\nrequires a fixed number of tokens per window, limiting the applicability of\nconventional pruning techniques. Meanwhile, training-free token clustering\napproaches have shown promise in image segmentation while maintaining window\nconsistency. Nevertheless, they fail to exploit temporal redundancy, missing a\nkey opportunity to further optimize video segmentation performance. We\nintroduce Temporal Cluster Assignment (TCA), a lightweight and effective,\nfine-tuning-free strategy that enhances token clustering by leveraging temporal\ncoherence across frames. Instead of indiscriminately dropping redundant tokens,\nTCA refines token clusters using temporal correlations, thereby retaining\nfine-grained details while significantly reducing computation. Extensive\nevaluations on YouTube-VIS 2019, YouTube-VIS 2021, OVIS, and a private surgical\nvideo dataset show that TCA consistently boosts the accuracy-speed trade-off of\nexisting clustering-based methods.

A significant\nchallenge in this domain arises from the inherent discrepancies between topics.\nWhile existing methods predominantly focus on extracting topic-shared features\nthrough distribution alignment of source and target topics, they often neglect\ntopic-specific features, limiting their ability to assess critical traits such\nas topic adherence. To address this limitation, we propose an Adversarial\nTOpic-aware Prompt-tuning (ATOP), a novel method that jointly learns\ntopic-shared and topic-specific features to improve cross-topic AES. ATOP\nachieves this by optimizing a learnable topic-aware prompt--comprising both\nshared and specific components--to elicit relevant knowledge from pre-trained\nlanguage models (PLMs). To enhance the robustness of topic-shared prompt\nlearning and mitigate feature scale sensitivity introduced by topic alignment,\nwe incorporate adversarial training within a unified regression and\nclassification framework.

However, current 3D scene design still\nrelies heavily on extensive manual effort from creators, and existing automated\nmethods struggle to generate open-domain scenes or support flexible editing. As\na result, generating 3D worlds directly from text has garnered increasing\nattention. In this paper, we introduce HOLODECK 2.0, an advanced\nvision-language-guided framework for 3D world generation with support for\ninteractive scene editing based on human feedback. HOLODECK 2.0 can generate\ndiverse and stylistically rich 3D scenes (e.g., realistic, cartoon, anime, and\ncyberpunk styles) that exhibit high semantic fidelity to fine-grained input\ndescriptions, suitable for both indoor and open-domain environments. HOLODECK\n2.0 leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to identify and parse the objects\nrequired in a scene and generates corresponding high-quality assets via\nstate-of-the-art 3D generative models. It then iteratively applies spatial\nconstraints derived from the VLMs to achieve semantically coherent and\nphysically plausible layouts. Human evaluations and CLIP-based assessments\ndemonstrate that HOLODECK 2.0 effectively generates high-quality scenes closely\naligned with detailed textual descriptions, consistently outperforming\nbaselines across indoor and open-domain scenarios. Additionally, we provide\nediting capabilities that flexibly adapt to human feedback, supporting layout\nrefinement and style-consistent object edits.

This, combined with on-board integrated\nchips for image and signal processing, makes the cell phone a versatile\npocket-sized computational imaging platform.

Prior work has developed different ways to probe this knowledge by\ninvestigating the hidden representations, crafting specific task prompts,\ncurating representative samples, and estimating their uncertainty. However,\nthese methods require making forward passes through the underlying model to\nprobe the LLM's knowledge about a specific fact, making them computationally\nexpensive and time-consuming. To bridge this gap, we propose $\\textbf{PEEK}$ or\n$\\textbf{P}$roxy $\\textbf{E}$mbeddings to $\\textbf{E}$stimate\n$\\textbf{K}$nowledge of LLMs, by leveraging the pre-trained embedding models\nthat effectively encode factual knowledge as text or graphs as proxies for\nLLMs. First, we identify a training set of facts known by LLMs through various\nprobing strategies and then adapt embedding models to predict the LLM outputs\nwith a linear decoder layer. Comprehensive evaluation on $3$ Wikipedia-derived\ndatasets, $4$ LLMs, and $7$ embedding models shows that embeddings can predict\nLLM knowledge on a held-out set with up to 90 % accuracy. Furthermore, we find\nthat sentence embedding models are more suitable than graph embeddings to\npredict LLM knowledge, shedding light on the underlying representation of the\nfactual landscape. Thus, we believe that knowledge-adapted embeddings can be\nused to identify knowledge gaps in LLMs at scale and can provide deeper\ninsights into LLMs' internal inductive bias.

However, existing methods face a\ndilemma: prompt engineering for closed-source models suffers from poor\nadaptability, while fine-tuning approaches for open-source models lack the\nrigorous reasoning capabilities essential for story evaluation.

Recent diffusion-based methods have\ndemonstrated significant potential in 2D-to-3D implicit mapping, they rely on\ndata-driven statistical priors and miss the explicit modeling of light-surface\ninteraction, leading to multi-view normal direction conflicts. Moreover, the\ndiscrete sampling mechanism of diffusion models causes gradient discontinuity\nin differentiable rendering reconstruction modules, preventing 3D geometric\nerrors from being backpropagated to the normal generation network, thereby\nforcing existing methods to depend on dense normal annotations. This paper\nproposes SINGAD, a novel Self-supervised framework from a single Image for\nNormal estimation via 3D GAussian splatting guided Diffusion. By integrating\nphysics-driven light-interaction modeling and a differentiable rendering-based\nreprojection strategy, our framework directly converts 3D geometric errors into\nnormal optimization signals, solving the challenges of multi-view geometric\ninconsistency and data dependency. Specifically, the framework constructs a\nlight-interaction-driven 3DGS reparameterization model to generate multi-scale\ngeometric features consistent with light transport principles, ensuring\nmulti-view normal consistency. A cross-domain feature fusion module is designed\nwithin a conditional diffusion model, embedding geometric priors to constrain\nnormal generation while maintaining accurate geometric error propagation.\nFurthermore, a differentiable 3D reprojection loss strategy is introduced for\nself-supervised optimization that minimizes geometric error between the\nreconstructed and input image, eliminating dependence on annotated normal\ndatasets.

The challenge is in the lack of access to out-of-distribution\n(target) data prior to deployment. Hence, rather than making assumptions\nregarding the target distribution, we utilize adversarial perturbations as a\nmechanism to explore the data space. This enables us to train an energy model\nthat scores local regions of depth predictions as in- or out-of-distribution.\nWe update the parameters of pretrained depth completion models at test time to\nminimize energy, effectively aligning test-time predictions to those of the\nsource distribution.

However,\nexisting white-box KD methods mainly focus on balancing ground truth and\nstudent-generated responses while overlooking two critical factors: training\ndata quality and student-model compatibility. To address these limitations, we\npropose Selective Reflection Distillation (SRD), a novel data curation\nframework that leverages reflections from student models to systematically\nrefine training data. SRD dynamically evaluates and selects prompt-response\npairs by comparing ground truth data with student model outputs, selectively\ncurating high-quality, student-compatible training instances through automated\nranking based on difficulty. Furthermore, after selecting the training data, a\ncurriculum scheduling strategy is employed to incrementally introduce these\ncurated subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals. As a\nplug-and-play enhancement, SRD consistently improves distillation outcomes\nacross diverse white-box KD approaches and model architectures, as well as\ndecreases computational cost significantly during KD training. Experiments on a\nrange of language model benchmarks demonstrate SRD's consistent improvements in\ndistilled model performance, as well as a reduction in training runtime by up\nto 39%, under diverse KD methods and model families. Notably, SRD operates as a\nplug-and-play module, enhancing sample efficiency without modifying underlying\nKD algorithms. Our findings highlight that data quality and compatibility are\npivotal to effective and efficient distillation of LLMs, and SRD provides a\nprincipled framework to achieve both.

Using attention\nweight perturbation, it analyzes the model's sensitivity to specific social\nattribute terms, thereby revealing the semantic pathways through which bias is\nformed. To validate the effectiveness of the method, this study uses the\nStereoSet dataset, which covers multiple stereotype dimensions including\ngender, profession, religion, and race. The evaluation focuses on several key\nmetrics, such as bias detection accuracy, semantic consistency, and contextual\nsensitivity. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves strong\ndetection performance across various dimensions. It can accurately identify\nbias differences between semantically similar texts while maintaining high\nsemantic alignment and output stability. The method also demonstrates high\ninterpretability in its structural design. It helps uncover the internal bias\nassociation mechanisms within language models.

A key technique in merging methods is sparsification, which\nprunes redundant parameters from task vectors to mitigate interference.\nHowever, prevailing approaches employ a ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy,\napplying a uniform sparsity ratio that overlooks the inherent structural and\nstatistical heterogeneity of model parameters. This often leads to a suboptimal\ntrade-off, where critical parameters are inadvertently pruned while less useful\nones are retained. To address this limitation, we introduce \\textbf{TADrop}\n(\\textbf{T}ensor-wise \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{Drop}), an adaptive\nsparsification strategy that respects this heterogeneity. Instead of a global\nratio, TADrop assigns a tailored sparsity level to each parameter tensor based\non its distributional properties. The core intuition is that tensors with\ndenser, more redundant distributions can be pruned aggressively, while sparser,\nmore critical ones are preserved. As a simple and plug-and-play module, we\nvalidate TADrop by integrating it with foundational, classic, and SOTA merging\nmethods. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks (vision, language, and\nmultimodal) and models (ViT, BEiT) demonstrate that TADrop consistently and\nsignificantly boosts their performance.

To address\nthis gap, we introduce MathReal, a meticulously curated dataset comprising\n2,000 mathematical questions with images captured by handheld mobile devices in\nauthentic scenarios. Each question is an image, containing the question text\nand visual element. We systematically classify the real images into three\nprimary categories: image quality degradation, perspective variation, and\nirrelevant content interference, which are further delineated into 14\nsubcategories. Additionally, MathReal spans five core knowledge and ability\ncategories, which encompass three question types and are divided into three\ndifficulty levels. To comprehensively evaluate the multimodal mathematical\nreasoning abilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs in real-world scenarios, we\ndesign six experimental settings that enable a systematic analysis of their\nperformance.

With the emergence of large language models\n(LLMs) in communicative contexts, this understanding needs to be further\nrefined and methodologically reconsidered. The first section challenges the\ntraditional semiotic trichotomy, arguing that connectionist LLM architectures\ndestabilize established hierarchies of meaning, and proposes the Human-Machine\nCommunication (HMC) framework as a more suitable alternative. The second\nsection examines the tension between human-centred pragmatic theories and the\nmachine-centred nature of LLMs. While traditional, Gricean-inspired pragmatics\ncontinue to dominate, it relies on human-specific assumptions ill-suited to\npredictive systems like LLMs. Probabilistic pragmatics, particularly the\nRational Speech Act framework, offers a more compatible teleology by focusing\non optimization rather than truth-evaluation. The third section addresses the\nissue of substitutionalism in three forms - generalizing, linguistic, and\ncommunicative - highlighting the anthropomorphic biases that distort LLM\nevaluation and obscure the role of human communicative subjects. Finally, the\npaper introduces the concept of context frustration to describe the paradox of\nincreased contextual input paired with a collapse in contextual understanding,\nemphasizing how users are compelled to co-construct pragmatic conditions both\nfor the model and themselves.

We use a dataset of recent news -- ensuring no overlap\nwith the model's pre-training data -- to evaluate the knowledge acquisition by\nprobing the model with question-answer pairs related the learned information.\nStarting from a continued pre-training baseline, we explored different\naugmentation algorithms to generate synthetic data to improve the knowledge\nacquisition capabilities. Our experiments show that simply continuing\npre-training on limited data yields modest improvements, whereas exposing the\nmodel to diverse textual variations significantly improves the learning of new\nfacts -- particularly with methods that induce greater variability through\ndiverse prompting. Furthermore, we shed light on the forgetting phenomenon in\nsmall-data regimes, illustrating the delicate balance between learning new\ncontent and retaining existing capabilities. We also confirm the sensitivity of\nRAG-based approaches for knowledge injection, which often lead to greater\ndegradation on control datasets compared to parametric methods. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that models can generate effective synthetic training data\nthemselves, suggesting a pathway toward self-improving model updates.

Recent open-vocabulary segmentation approaches leverage pretrained\ntext-to-image (T2I) diffusion model features for strong zero-shot transfer, but\ntypically group entire humans into a single person category, failing to\ndistinguish diverse clothing or detailed body parts. To address this, we\npropose Spectrum, a unified network for part-level pixel parsing (body parts\nand clothing) and instance-level grouping. While diffusion-based\nopen-vocabulary models generalize well across tasks, their internal\nrepresentations are not specialized for detailed human parsing. We observe\nthat, unlike diffusion models with broad representations, image-driven 3D\ntexture generators maintain faithful correspondence to input images, enabling\nstronger representations for parsing diverse clothing and body parts. Spectrum\nintroduces a novel repurposing of an Image-to-Texture (I2Tx) diffusion model --\nobtained by fine-tuning a T2I model on 3D human texture maps -- for improved\nalignment with body parts and clothing. From an input image, we extract\nhuman-part internal features via the I2Tx diffusion model and generate\nsemantically valid masks aligned to diverse clothing categories through\nprompt-guided grounding.

While\nprevious efforts mitigate this by selecting only important visual features or\nleveraging learnable queries to reduce token count, they often compromise\nperformance or introduce substantial extra costs. In response, we propose\nFourier-VLM, a simple yet efficient method that compresses visual\nrepresentations in the frequency domain. Our approach is motivated by the\nobservation that vision features output from the vision encoder exhibit\nconcentrated energy in low-frequency components. Leveraging this, we apply a\nlow-pass filter to the vision features using a two-dimentional Discrete Cosine\nTransform (DCT). Notably, the DCT is efficiently computed via the Fast Fourier\nTransform (FFT) operator with a time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n\\log n)$,\nminimizing the extra computational cost while introducing no additional\nparameters. Extensive experiments across various image-based benchmarks\ndemonstrate that Fourier-VLM achieves competitive performance with strong\ngeneralizability across both LLaVA and Qwen-VL architectures.

To\nresolve these limitations, we propose to formulate image editing as Next\nEditing-token Prediction (NEP) based on autoregressive image generation, where\nonly regions that need to be edited are regenerated, thus avoiding unintended\nmodification to the non-editing areas. To enable any-region editing, we propose\nto pre-train an any-order autoregressive text-to-image (T2I) model. Once\ntrained, it is capable of zero-shot image editing and can be easily adapted to\nNEP for image editing, which achieves a new state-of-the-art on widely used\nimage editing benchmarks. Moreover, our model naturally supports test-time\nscaling (TTS) through iteratively refining its generation in a zero-shot\nmanner.

Although both are\nclass-agnostic segmentation tasks that map from RGB space to binary space, the\nformer aims to identify the most salient objects in the image, while the latter\nfocuses on detecting perfectly camouflaged objects that blend into the\nbackground in the image. These two tasks exhibit strong contradictory\nattributes. Previous works have mostly believed that joint learning of these\ntwo tasks would confuse the network, reducing its performance on both tasks.\nHowever, here we present an opposite perspective: with the correct approach to\nlearning, the network can simultaneously possess the capability to find both\nsalient and camouflaged objects, allowing both tasks to benefit from joint\nlearning. We propose SCJoint, a joint learning scheme for SOD and COD tasks,\nassuming that the decoding processes of SOD and COD have different distribution\ncharacteristics. The key to our method is to learn the respective means and\nvariances of the decoding processes for both tasks by inserting a minimal\namount of task-specific learnable parameters within a fully shared network\nstructure, thereby decoupling the contradictory attributes of the two tasks at\na minimal cost. Furthermore, we propose a saliency-based sampling strategy\n(SBSS) to sample the training set of the SOD task to balance the training set\nsizes of the two tasks. In addition, SBSS improves the training set quality and\nshortens the training time. Based on the proposed SCJoint and SBSS, we train a\npowerful generalist network, named JoNet, which has the ability to\nsimultaneously capture both ``salient\" and ``camouflaged\".

We introduce\nChatAnime, the first Emotionally Supportive Role-Playing (ESRP) dataset.

Then, we execute a\nnationwide selection process to identify 40 Chinese anime enthusiasts with\nprofound knowledge of specific characters and extensive experience in\nrole-playing. Next, we systematically collect two rounds of dialogue data from\n10 LLMs and these 40 Chinese anime enthusiasts. To evaluate the ESRP\nperformance of LLMs, we design a user experience-oriented evaluation system\nfeaturing 9 fine-grained metrics across three dimensions: basic dialogue,\nrole-playing and emotional support, along with an overall metric for response\ndiversity.

Results show that LLMs fine-tuned in one or two languages\ncan reliably classify immigration-related content in unseen languages.

Current mainstream VQA methods typically improve\nperformance by pretraining on large-scale classification datasets (e.g.,\nImageNet, Kinetics-400), followed by fine-tuning on VQA datasets. However, this\nstrategy presents two significant challenges: (1) merely transferring semantic\nknowledge learned from pretraining is insufficient for VQA, as video quality\ndepends on multiple factors (e.g., semantics, distortion, motion, aesthetics);\n(2) pretraining on large-scale datasets demands enormous computational\nresources, often dozens or even hundreds of times greater than training\ndirectly on VQA datasets. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown\nremarkable generalization capabilities across a wide range of visual tasks, and\nhave begun to demonstrate promising potential in quality assessment. In this\nwork, we propose Q-CLIP, the first fully VLMs-based framework for VQA. Q-CLIP\nenhances both visual and textual representations through a Shared Cross-Modal\nAdapter (SCMA), which contains only a minimal number of trainable parameters\nand is the only component that requires training. This design significantly\nreduces computational cost. In addition, we introduce a set of five learnable\nquality-level prompts to guide the VLMs in perceiving subtle quality\nvariations, thereby further enhancing the model's sensitivity to video quality.\nFurthermore, we investigate the impact of different frame sampling strategies\non VQA performance, and find that frame-difference-based sampling leads to\nbetter generalization performance across datasets.

Most existing Image Manipulation Localization (IML) methods\nrely on discriminative learning and require large, high-quality annotated\ndatasets. However, current datasets lack sufficient scale and diversity,\nlimiting model performance in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, recent\nstudies have explored Constrained IML (CIML), which generates pixel-level\nannotations through algorithmic supervision. However, existing CIML approaches\noften depend on complex multi-stage pipelines, making the annotation process\ninefficient. In this work, we propose a novel generative framework based on\ndiffusion models, named UGD-IML, which for the first time unifies both IML and\nCIML tasks within a single framework. By learning the underlying data\ndistribution, generative diffusion models inherently reduce the reliance on\nlarge-scale labeled datasets, allowing our approach to perform effectively even\nunder limited data conditions. In addition, by leveraging a class embedding\nmechanism and a parameter-sharing design, our model seamlessly switches between\nIML and CIML modes without extra components or training overhead. Furthermore,\nthe end-to-end design enables our model to avoid cumbersome steps in the data\nannotation process. Extensive experimental results on multiple datasets\ndemonstrate that UGD-IML outperforms the SOTA methods by an average of 9.66 and\n4.36 in terms of F1 metrics for IML and CIML tasks, respectively.

However, existing\nmultimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially open-source ones, are\nstill falling behind with a typical success rate of 30%-50% on challenging\nbenchmarks. Previous studies on fine-tuning MLLMs with synthetic charts are\noften restricted by their inadequate similarity to the real charts, which could\ncompromise model training and performance on complex real-world charts. In this\nstudy, we show that modularizing chart generation and diversifying visual\ndetails improves chart understanding capabilities. In particular, we design a\nfive-step data synthesis pipeline, where we separate data and function creation\nfor single plot generation, condition the generation of later subplots on\nearlier ones for multi-subplot figures, visually diversify the generated\nfigures, filter out low quality data, and finally generate the question-answer\n(QA) pairs with GPT-4o.

This paper proposes a diffusion-based\nsolution to learn human motion priors and fuse the two modalities of signals\ntogether seamlessly in a unified framework. By delicately considering the\ncharacteristics of the two signals, the sequential visual information is\nconsidered as a whole and transformed into a condition embedding, while the\ninertial measurement is concatenated with the noisy body pose frame by frame to\nconstruct a sequential input for the diffusion model. Firstly, we observe that\nthe visual information may be unavailable in some frames due to occlusions or\nsubjects moving out of the camera view. Thus incorporating the sequential\nvisual features as a whole to get a single feature embedding is robust to the\noccasional degenerations of visual information in those frames. On the other\nhand, the IMU measurements are robust to occlusions and always stable when\nsignal transmission has no problem. So incorporating them frame-wisely could\nbetter explore the temporal information for the system.

Timely intervention in\nAD relies heavily on early and precise diagnosis, which remains challenging due\nto the complex and subtle structural changes in the brain. Most existing deep\nlearning methods focus only on a single plane of structural magnetic resonance\nimaging (sMRI) and struggle to accurately capture the complex and nonlinear\nrelationships among pathological regions of the brain, thus limiting their\nability to precisely identify atrophic features. To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose an innovative framework, MPF-KANSC, which integrates multi-plane\nfusion (MPF) for combining features from the coronal, sagittal, and axial\nplanes, and a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-guided spatial-channel attention\nmechanism (KANSC) to more effectively learn and represent sMRI atrophy\nfeatures. Specifically, the proposed model enables parallel feature extraction\nfrom multiple anatomical planes, thus capturing more comprehensive structural\ninformation.

This paper investigates a critical question for compute-optimal\ndiffusion model deployment: Under a post-training setting without fine-tuning,\nis it more effective to reduce the number of denoising steps or to use a\ncheaper per-step inference? Intuitively, reducing the number of denoising steps\nincreases the variability of the distributions across steps, making the model\nmore sensitive to compression. In contrast, keeping more denoising steps makes\nthe differences smaller, preserving redundancy, and making post-training\ncompression more feasible. To systematically examine this, we propose PostDiff,\na training-free framework for accelerating pre-trained diffusion models by\nreducing redundancy at both the input level and module level in a post-training\nmanner. At the input level, we propose a mixed-resolution denoising scheme\nbased on the insight that reducing generation resolution in early denoising\nsteps can enhance low-frequency components and improve final generation\nfidelity. At the module level, we employ a hybrid module caching strategy to\nreuse computations across denoising steps. Extensive experiments and ablation\nstudies demonstrate that (1) PostDiff can significantly improve the\nfidelity-efficiency trade-off of state-of-the-art diffusion models, and (2) to\nboost efficiency while maintaining decent generation fidelity, reducing\nper-step inference cost is often more effective than reducing the number of\ndenoising steps.

The dataset comprises 562\nmotion sequences of human-object interactions, with each sequence performed by\nsubjects of different genders interacting with 35 3D objects that vary in size,\nshape, and weight. This dataset stands out by significantly extending the scope\nof existing ones for understanding how the physical attributes of different\nobjects influence human posture, speed, motion scale, and interacting\nstrategies.

Under the\nWeakly-Supervised VAD (WSVAD) paradigm, only video-level labels are provided\nduring training, while predictions are made at the frame level. Although\nstate-of-the-art models perform well on simple anomalies (e.g., explosions),\nthey struggle with complex real-world events (e.g., shoplifting). This\ndifficulty stems from two key issues: (1) the inability of current models to\naddress the diversity of anomaly types, as they process all categories with a\nshared model, overlooking category-specific features; and (2) the weak\nsupervision signal, which lacks precise temporal information, limiting the\nability to capture nuanced anomalous patterns blended with normal events. To\naddress these challenges, we propose Gaussian Splatting-guided Mixture of\nExperts (GS-MoE), a novel framework that employs a set of expert models, each\nspecialized in capturing specific anomaly types.

Prior\nworks showed that the language modality can help in the adaptation process,\nexhibiting more robustness to such complex shifts. In this paper, we introduce\nTRUST, a novel UDA approach that exploits the robustness of the language\nmodality to guide the adaptation of a vision model. TRUST generates\npseudo-labels for target samples from their captions and introduces a novel\nuncertainty estimation strategy that uses normalised CLIP similarity scores to\nestimate the uncertainty of the generated pseudo-labels. Such estimated\nuncertainty is then used to reweight the classification loss, mitigating the\nadverse effects of wrong pseudo-labels obtained from low-quality captions. To\nfurther increase the robustness of the vision model, we propose a multimodal\nsoft-contrastive learning loss that aligns the vision and language feature\nspaces, by leveraging captions to guide the contrastive training of the vision\nmodel on target images. In our contrastive loss, each pair of images acts as\nboth a positive and a negative pair and their feature representations are\nattracted and repulsed with a strength proportional to the similarity of their\ncaptions. This solution avoids the need for hardly determining positive and\nnegative pairs, which is critical in the UDA setting.

Land Surface\nTemperature (LST) is a key variable in this context and is retrieved from\nremote sensing satellites. However, these systems face a trade-off between\nspatial and temporal resolution. While spatio-temporal fusion methods offer\npromising solutions, few have addressed the estimation of daily LST at 10 m\nresolution. In this study, we present WGAST, a Weakly-Supervised Generative\nNetwork for Daily 10 m LST Estimation via Spatio-Temporal Fusion of Terra\nMODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2. WGAST is the first end-to-end deep learning\nframework designed for this task. It adopts a conditional generative\nadversarial architecture, with a generator composed of four stages: feature\nextraction, fusion, LST reconstruction, and noise suppression. The first stage\nemploys a set of encoders to extract multi-level latent representations from\nthe inputs, which are then fused in the second stage using cosine similarity,\nnormalization, and temporal attention mechanisms. The third stage decodes the\nfused features into high-resolution LST, followed by a Gaussian filter to\nsuppress high-frequency noise. Training follows a weakly supervised strategy\nbased on physical averaging principles and reinforced by a PatchGAN\ndiscriminator. Experiments demonstrate that WGAST outperforms existing methods\nin both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

In this paper, we propose Lightswitch, a novel finetuned\nmaterial-relighting diffusion framework that efficiently relights an arbitrary\nnumber of input images to a target lighting condition while incorporating cues\nfrom inferred intrinsic properties. By using multi-view and material\ninformation cues together with a scalable denoising scheme, our method\nconsistently and efficiently relights dense multi-view data of objects with\ndiverse material compositions. We show that our 2D relighting prediction\nquality exceeds previous state-of-the-art relighting priors that directly\nrelight from images. We further demonstrate that LightSwitch matches or\noutperforms state-of-the-art diffusion inverse rendering methods in relighting\nsynthetic and real objects in as little as 2 minutes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Lightswitch\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\u76843D\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u6750\u8d28\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u76842D\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5185\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\u6216\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLightswitch\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u6750\u8d28\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u6750\u8d28\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "Lightswitch\u57282D\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u9884\u6d4b\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4ec5\u97002\u5206\u949f\u3002", "conclusion": "Lightswitch\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u6750\u8d28\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}
